This is just a really fun show and I recommend it to anybody. I think some facets of the show get old after a while but I always loved Johnny Drama do just made me laugh so hard.  Another thing that I like are all the cameos for major Hollywood stars how they casually appear just in passing. I think Michael Phelps was on the show for 3 seconds that is so funny. My favorite cameo was 50 cent when he pulled up in his white Rolls-Royce. The one thing that the show did was make me question if the actors on the show who are making cameos or actually like this in real life... I mean Seth Green was a real douche on the show and I wonder if he acts like that in real-life? I guess that's what makes it good acting. And Bob Saget not quite sure if that guy is as crazy in real life as he is in the show... he's crazy in this show.That's all for some things to keep in mind if you're looking for a fun show Entourage is definitely a fun show it just has some later season lull. Oh one more thing to note they might be coming out with an Entourage movie that should be a great time!At the time of writing this it's slightly more to buy this Blu-ray collection that is to buy the individual seasons (barring the fact the you can't get seasons 1 through 5 on Blu-ray)and this is a good deal. The DVD collection is way more expensive than buying the individual seasons so if you want on DVD I would say by each season separately at a time of writing this it was about $60 cheaper to buy them individually.Okay thanks for reading I hope you enjoy this review.,4,A great series...

1494537,A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B005MT3830,Darren O'Neill,"[6, 9]","Entourage is without a doubt a show that was strictly aimed at the male audience.  It made no apologies for the fact that the show featured plenty of eye candy, but to dismiss it as just a drawn out B-movie is to miss out on the fact that the show is about a group of male friends living a pretty blessed life in Hollywood and having some amazing adventures along the way.One of the things I like about the series is that all of the characters are likable, even with the flaws that they have.  The show is based around Adrian Grenier's character Vincent Chase who is the ""big time movie star"" from Queens, New York surrounded by his entourage of brother Johnny ""Drama"" Chase, played magnificently by Kevin Dillon, best friend Eric ""E"" Murphy, played by Kevin Connolly and Turtle, played by Jerry Ferrara.  The interaction between these characters is so perfect that you would swear that they really did grow up together.  The last main character is Ari Gold, Vincent Chase's manager played with gusto by Jeremy Piven.Part of the genius of this series is that throughout the eight seasons they intertwine so many Hollywood people playing themselves that you really do buy into the possibility that these characters featured on the show are real.  I'd start a list of them, but it would take up way too much of the review.  Go over to IMDB and look at the full cast list for the series and you'll see the full list.I think that a big part of the fun here is getting to live vicariously through the lives of this group of guys.  The show portrays the Hollywood lifestyle a lot like beer ads portray real life.  There are beautiful women everywhere, the finest sportscars to drive, some amazing houses to live and and some amazing vacation spots.  If there are any guys in the world that would not want to live Vincent Chase's lifestyle if he had the shot, I certainly don't know any of them.The thing, I believe, that keeps the viewers engrossed here is that these characters are still very down to Earth.  They're the kinds of guys that you're pretty sure you'd get along with if you bumped into them in a bar.  Vincent Chase is the meal ticket here, but he certainly doesn't see his friends as anything but equals most of the time.  He knows that they're a team and while he may have the pretty face, the other guys bring just as much to the table, especially his friend ""E"" who takes on the role as his manager.I fully believe that Entourage could work as a show even if you took these characters and took them out of Hollywood.  It's the day to day interactions between them that really makes the show shine.  The comradery between the characters, the busting of each others balls, it just feels so natural that you really forget you're watching a scripted show.  When things get tough, you just know that these guys will rally together and friendship will win out in the end.The bottom line is this is a series about friendship that just happens to be set in Hollywood where we get the benefit of a lot of eye candy, which makes the show even more fun.  Guys will, without a doubt, love this show and a lot of women will too as my wife also rates the show highly.

1494544,A6JQ6I9LGKXBG,B005MT3830,Paul Wiseman,"[5, 29]","This review is meant to cover all eight seasons. Spoilers ahead. ""Entourage'' was a guilty pleasure, depicting a fantasyland where all the girls were beautiful (and available), all the cars cool, all the restaurants fabulous and money was never (or rarely) a problem.Ari, Drama and Lloyd are great characters. But some of the best performances come from outside the full-time cast: Seth Green's hilariously hate-able take on himself; Adam Goldberg's intense, self-destructive Nick Rubenstein; Rhys Coiro's volatile Billy Walsh; Bob Saget going against type to portray himself as a sex-crazed vulgarian.But ""Entourage'' clearly suffers from a hole at its heart. Adrian Grenier is likable enough as Vincent Chase. But he simply isn't convincing as a movie star. The front man for a boy band or pop group? Sure. A celebrity male model? Maybe. But movie stars need to have an edge, a gravitas, that Grenier simply lacks. (That said, I thought he was noticeably stronger in the final season.)The writing is uneven. The finale of Season 5 -- in which huge problems are introduced and resolved by the closing credits -- is an abomination. Vince's descent into madness in Season 7 seems to come out of nowhere; he'd previously taken his Hollywood adventure in stride.""Entourage"" also has a woman problem. Ari's sexist rants and the boys' view of women as disposable sex objects wear thin. (True, there are some strong and sympathetic women characters: I was particularly fond of Constance Zimmer's Dana Gordon. And I certainly wasn't immune to the physical charms of the women of ""Entourage"" -- particularly Lizzie Grant; Billy Walsh's Season 4 girlfriend, Catherine; Phil Yagoda's secretary, whom moviegoers might remember as Miss California in ""Little Miss Sunshine.'')The writers couldn't seem to decide if porn star Sasha Grey was a surprisingly grounded career woman or a nasty femme fatale who led Vince astray. Recall that in the series' last few episodes, when Ari and E are estranged from the women they love, both men enjoy more-or-less casual flings. But Mrs. Ari and Sloan, the writers make clear, are too deeply devoted to their men to sleep with anyone else -- an old-fashioned double standard in a series that otherwise revels in casual sex.In short, ""Entourage'' adds up to a lot of eye candy and a few laughs. But it's probably best not to think too deeply about it.",3,"A lot of eye candy, a few laughs - beware spoilers",1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,2375,"['review', 'meant', 'cover', 'eight', 'seasons', 'Spoilers', 'ahead', 'Entourage', 'was', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'depicting', 'fantasyland', 'where', 'girls', 'were', 'beautiful', 'available', 'cars', 'cool', 'restaurants', 'fabulous', 'money', 'was', 'never', 'rarely', 'problem.Ari', 'Drama', 'Lloyd', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'best', 'performances', 'come', 'full-time', 'cast', 'Seth', 'Green', 'hilariously', 'hate-able', 'take', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'intense', 'self-destructive', 'Nick', 'Rubenstein', 'Rhys', 'Coiro', 'volatile', 'Billy', 'Walsh', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'going', 'type', 'portray', 'sex-crazed', 'vulgarian.But', 'Entourage', 'clearly', 'suffers', 'hole', 'heart', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'likable', 'enough', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'simply', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'movie', 'star', 'front', 'man', 'boy', 'band', 'pop', 'group', 'Sure', 'celebrity', 'male', 'model', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'stars', 'need', 'have', 'edge', 'gravitas', 'Grenier', 'simply', 'said', 'thought', 'was', 'noticeably', 'stronger', 'final', 'season', 'writing', 'uneven', 'finale', 'Season', '5', 'huge', 'problems', 'are', 'introduced', 'resolved', 'closing', 'credits', 'abomination', 'Vince', 'descent', 'madness', 'Season', '7', 'come', 'nowhere', ""'d"", 'previously', 'taken', 'Hollywood', 'adventure', 'stride', 'Entourage', 'also', 'woman', 'problem', 'Ari', 'sexist', 'rants', 'boys', 'view', 'women', 'disposable', 'sex', 'objects', 'wear', 'thin', 'True', 'are', 'strong', 'sympathetic', 'women', 'characters', 'was', 'particularly', 'fond', 'Constance', 'Zimmer', 'Dana', 'Gordon', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'immune', 'physical', 'charms', 'women', 'Entourage', 'particularly', 'Lizzie', 'Grant', 'Billy', 'Walsh', 'Season', '4', 'girlfriend', 'Catherine', 'Phil', 'Yagoda', 'secretary', 'whom', 'moviegoers', 'might', 'remember', 'Miss', 'California', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'decide', 'porn', 'star', 'Sasha', 'Grey', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'grounded', 'career', 'woman', 'nasty', 'femme', 'fatale', 'who', 'led', 'Vince', 'astray', 'Recall', 'series', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'when', 'Ari', 'E', 'are', 'estranged', 'women', 'love', 'men', 'enjoy', 'more-or-less', 'casual', 'flings', 'Mrs.', 'Ari', 'Sloan', 'writers', 'make', 'clear', 'are', 'too', 'deeply', 'devoted', 'men', 'sleep', 'anyone', 'else', 'old-fashioned', 'double', 'standard', 'series', 'otherwise', 'casual', 'sex.In', 'short', 'Entourage', 'up', 'lot', 'eye', 'candy', 'few', 'laughs', 'probably', 'best', 'not', 'think', 'too', 'deeply']",Entourage: The Complete Series

This tale of friendship and fun is very enjoyable and it's great that it's finally been collected into one set and on high definition.  What's even better is that this Blu-ray set offers great audio and visual quality and a good selection of extras as well.  I would have liked even more extras for a massive set like this, but I'm still pretty happy with what I got.  If you enjoyed the show, then I highly recommend you get this set and watch the complete journey with these characters to see their stories from the beginning to the end.So what can you expect when it comes to the Extras. See below!ExtrasAudio Commentaries - There's twenty-one audio commentaries included (basically about three per season) with a rotating cast  of speakers that include show creator Doug Ellin, Executive Producer Larry Charles, Mark Wahlberg, Adrian Grenier, Kevin Connolly, Kevin Dillon, Jerry Ferrara and Jeremy Piven just to name some of them.  They share stories and talk about their characters, the inspiration for the show, and make each other laugh.Behind the Scenes of Entourage - A ten minute talk with Mark Wahlberg and the main cast talking about the characters and the show.The Mark Wahlberg Sessions - Another extra that features Wahlberg but this one is a little more in depth as it runs over twenty minutes long.  Wahlberg talks about the inspiration for the show being his real life friends and how their history turned into the show.  We even see some of his real life friends make an appearance.Vegas Baby, Vegas!- A short look behind the scenes of the cast filming an episode in Las Vegas.Museum of Television & Radio - At almost an hour long, this extra is the longest and most in depth look into the show with the show's PaleyFest panel going into the details of the show and the characters.  Show creator Doug Ellin, the main cast, and Co-Executive Producer Julian Farino appear on the panel.  This is my favorite extra in this set and I wish more shows that have done one of these PaleyFest panels would include it as an extra too.Anatomy of Entourage - A brief behind the scenes look at the season three finale.US Comedy Arts Festival Panel - Another great panel that runs almost an hour, but this time features Doug Ellin, Adrian Grenier, Kevin Connolly, and Jeremy Piven as they discuss the first four seasons of the show.The Making of Medellin - A brief look at the making of the season four premiere's fake film.Medellin Trailer - The fake trailer for the fake film Medellin that Vince starred in for the fourth season.Meet the Newest Member of Entourage - A two minute look at Doug Ellin's progeny Lucas Ellin.The Celebrity Factor - A list of all of the celebrity cameos that occurred during season five.Life on Top - A fifteen minute featurette devoted to show how the characters evolved from season to season.A Day at the Speedway - A very short look at the making of the episode ""One Car, Two Car, Red Car, Blue Car"".ONEXONE PSA - This is a very funny fake public service announcement with Vince and Ari in character making a PSA with guest star Matt Damon there to direct it.  It's pretty funny!Inside the Hollywood Highlife - A look at the seventh season of the show and where the characters are in their lives at that point.The Shades of Sasha Grey - A six minute talk with adult film star Sasha Grey who made a couple of guest appearances on the show.  She candidly talks about working in the porn industry.Hollywood Sunset: A Farewell to Entourage - This extra is a thirty minute retrospective that includes series creator Doug Ellin, writer/executive producer Ally Musika, and actors Adrian Grenier, Kevin Connolly, Kevin Dillon and Jerry Ferrara.  They talk about the rough start the show had and how it evolved.  Jeremy Piven and Rex Lee also join in and offer their perspectives on the show and their characters.  We also get to see some of the cast's auditions and behind the scenes footage.  All of this is entertaining but I wish it had been longer especially since this is the only extra from the final season.",5,"As Ari Gold would say, Let's Hug It Out, B@$%^!",1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,4174,"['was', 'glad', 'see', 'Entourage', 'maintain', 'quality', 'course', 'series', 'manage', 'end', 'strong', 'final', 'season', 'tale', 'friendship', 'fun', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'finally', 'been', 'collected', 'one', 'set', 'high', 'definition', 'What', 'even', 'better', 'Blu-ray', 'set', 'offers', 'great', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'good', 'selection', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'even', 'more', 'extras', 'massive', 'set', ""'m"", 'still', 'pretty', 'happy', 'what', 'got', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'get', 'set', 'watch', 'complete', 'journey', 'characters', 'see', 'stories', 'beginning', 'end.So', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'when', 'Extras', 'See', 'ExtrasAudio', 'Commentaries', 'twenty-one', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'included', 'basically', 'three', 'season', 'rotating', 'cast', 'speakers', 'include', 'show', 'creator', 'Doug', 'Ellin', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'Jerry', 'Ferrara', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'just', 'name', 'share', 'stories', 'talk', 'characters', 'inspiration', 'show', 'make', 'other', 'Scenes', 'Entourage', 'ten', 'minute', 'talk', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'main', 'cast', 'talking', 'characters', 'show.The', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Sessions', 'extra', 'Wahlberg', 'one', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'long', 'Wahlberg', 'talks', 'inspiration', 'show', 'being', 'real', 'life', 'friends', 'how', 'history', 'turned', 'show', 'even', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'friends', 'make', 'appearance.Vegas', 'Baby', 'Vegas', 'short', 'look', 'scenes', 'cast', 'filming', 'episode', 'Las', 'Vegas.Museum', 'Television', 'Radio', 'almost', 'hour', 'long', 'extra', 'longest', 'most', 'depth', 'look', 'show', 'show', 'PaleyFest', 'panel', 'going', 'details', 'show', 'characters', 'Show', 'creator', 'Doug', 'Ellin', 'main', 'cast', 'Co-Executive', 'Producer', 'Julian', 'Farino', 'appear', 'panel', 'favorite', 'extra', 'set', 'wish', 'more', 'shows', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'PaleyFest', 'panels', 'would', 'include', 'extra', 'too.Anatomy', 'Entourage', 'brief', 'scenes', 'look', 'season', 'three', 'finale.US', 'Comedy', 'Arts', 'Festival', 'Panel', 'great', 'panel', 'almost', 'hour', 'time', 'Doug', 'Ellin', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'discuss', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'show.The', 'Making', 'Medellin', 'brief', 'look', 'making', 'season', 'four', 'premiere', 'fake', 'film.Medellin', 'Trailer', 'fake', 'trailer', 'fake', 'film', 'Medellin', 'Vince', 'starred', 'fourth', 'season.Meet', 'Newest', 'Member', 'Entourage', 'two', 'minute', 'look', 'Doug', 'Ellin', 'progeny', 'Lucas', 'Ellin.The', 'Celebrity', 'Factor', 'list', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'occurred', 'season', 'five.Life', 'Top', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'featurette', 'devoted', 'show', 'how', 'characters', 'evolved', 'season', 'season.A', 'Day', 'Speedway', 'very', 'short', 'look', 'making', 'episode', 'One', 'Car', 'Two', 'Car', 'Red', 'Car', 'Blue', 'Car', '.ONEXONE', 'PSA', 'very', 'funny', 'fake', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'Vince', 'Ari', 'character', 'making', 'PSA', 'guest', 'star', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'there', 'direct', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Hollywood', 'Highlife', 'look', 'seventh', 'season', 'show', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'lives', 'point.The', 'Shades', 'Sasha', 'Grey', 'six', 'minute', 'talk', 'adult', 'film', 'star', 'Sasha', 'Grey', 'who', 'made', 'couple', 'guest', 'appearances', 'show', 'candidly', 'talks', 'working', 'porn', 'industry.Hollywood', 'Sunset', 'Farewell', 'Entourage', 'extra', 'thirty', 'minute', 'retrospective', 'series', 'creator', 'Doug', 'Ellin', 'writer/executive', 'producer', 'Ally', 'Musika', 'actors', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'Jerry', 'Ferrara', 'talk', 'rough', 'start', 'show', 'had', 'how', 'evolved', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Rex', 'Lee', 'also', 'join', 'offer', 'perspectives', 'show', 'characters', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'cast', 'auditions', 'scenes', 'footage', 'entertaining', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'longer', 'especially', 'only', 'extra', 'final', 'season']",Entourage: The Complete Series

Each and every set was defective the same way and had to be returned. It wasn't the fault of my player (it's new and plays everything else just fine) and it is not the fault of the sellers, but if you are looking to buy this set, I'd say wait a while till this load gets removed and new ones replace them.I gave this one star because not rating it doesn't let this get posted, but the show is great and Amazon does it's best.",1,Entourage box set,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,576,"['have', 'tried', 'four', 'times', 'month', 'April', '2013', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'Entourage', 'three', 'different', 'vendors', 'Amazon', 'Best', 'Buy', 'Barnes', 'Noble', 'set', 'was', 'defective', 'same', 'way', 'had', 'be', 'returned', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'player', 'new', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'fine', 'not', 'fault', 'sellers', 'are', 'looking', 'buy', 'set', ""'d"", 'say', 'wait', 'while', 'till', 'load', 'removed', 'new', 'ones', 'replace', 'them.I', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'not', 'rating', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'posted', 'show', 'great', 'Amazon', 'best']",Entourage: The Complete Series

Entourage was one of the few shows that I watched religously when it was on the air and when it ended I was so sad to see it go. As someone who will probably never get to Hollywood it was grea to see a show that was about 4 guys from my hometown making it big and yet amonst all the glitz and glamour managed to stay tough, brash and of course together as friends.Many people did give this show a little flack after season 3 because was apparently not as great as the first 3 seasons. While I will admit that season 4 was a little as a whole the story was rich in detail and character development and it all fit in the end. Of course the characters are some of the best ever put onto television and it is so hard to single one out as the best because they are all such great characters. Of course having a bunch of famous faces show up and just act as normal people is great too. It is a story about a life most of us wish we had and yet when I wathced the show, I felt like I have a good life and felt at ease as I watched.This is just an entertaining and fun show. It has moments that will make you laugh, tense up and even be left dumbfounded based on what you see. It will only make you crave more with each episode.",5,Amazing Show,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,1302,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'HBO', 'just', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'best', 'shows', 'Entourage', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'watched', 'religously', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'when', 'ended', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'see', 'go', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'get', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'grea', 'see', 'show', 'was', '4', 'guys', 'hometown', 'making', 'big', 'yet', 'amonst', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'managed', 'stay', 'tough', 'brash', 'course', 'together', 'friends.Many', 'people', 'did', 'give', 'show', 'little', 'flack', 'season', '3', 'was', 'apparently', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'will', 'admit', 'season', '4', 'was', 'little', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'rich', 'detail', 'character', 'development', 'fit', 'end', 'course', 'characters', 'are', 'best', 'ever', 'put', 'television', 'so', 'hard', 'single', 'one', 'out', 'best', 'are', 'such', 'great', 'characters', 'course', 'having', 'bunch', 'famous', 'show', 'up', 'just', 'act', 'normal', 'people', 'great', 'too', 'story', 'life', 'most', 'wish', 'had', 'yet', 'when', 'wathced', 'show', 'felt', 'have', 'good', 'life', 'felt', 'ease', 'watched.This', 'just', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'show', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'tense', 'up', 'even', 'be', 'left', 'dumbfounded', 'based', 'what', 'see', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'crave', 'more', 'episode']",Entourage: The Complete Series
