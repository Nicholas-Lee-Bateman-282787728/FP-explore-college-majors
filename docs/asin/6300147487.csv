196901,A1J8JL5I49S9KE,6300147487,"E. R. Joseph ""movies & music""","[3, 3]","The Oscar - is a picture that is all too ignored.  In 1966, Stephen Boyd, Elke Sommer, Milton Berle, Eleanor Parker and many other top-notch stars made this film about an ambitcious young actor determined to make ""good"" in Hollywood.  He stops at nothing to achive his goal, and is eventually nominated for an Oscar.  Stephen Boyd's performance should have won him an oscar.  He creates a character you hate but cannot take your eyes off of.  There is intrigue, lies, murder and other untasteful things which keep the movie moving along.  The end is a shocker.  Bettcha you can't figure it out.",5,Better than the Oscar,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,594,"['Oscar', 'picture', 'too', 'ignored', '1966', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'Elke', 'Sommer', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'many', 'other', 'top-notch', 'stars', 'made', 'film', 'ambitcious', 'young', 'actor', 'determined', 'make', 'good', 'Hollywood', 'nothing', 'achive', 'goal', 'eventually', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'oscar', 'character', 'hate', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'intrigue', 'murder', 'other', 'untasteful', 'things', 'keep', 'movie', 'moving', 'along', 'end', 'shocker', 'Bettcha', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out']",The Oscar VHS
196902,A1X0L2JLAWJVFM,6300147487,"Jay Lesiger ""jay in chelsea""","[3, 7]","I had the distinct pleasure of watching this dog of a film for an entire week in the 1960s, when I worked as an usher at the RKO Kenmore, an old movie palace that had been a vaudeville theatre in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn (now long gone). It is difficult to describe the awfulness of this film, and that includes the writing, the direction and above all, the acting. This phoney/chic story of a would-be Hollywood star who tried to ""buy"" an Oscar would probably be the least likely Oscar nominee in history. It was so bad that it was one of the earliest films to open without pre-press reviews (it opened on a Friday, in the hopes that no one would read the Saturday papers), but to no avail. The public, as they say, stayed away in droves. The lowest among many low points (this film put the nail in the coffin of Stephen Boyd's film career) is the climactic ""monologue"" of pop singer Tony Bennett in his first (and last) film role as Hymie Kelly (don't ask), the anti-hero's best friend.This film is not available on DVD; be glad.",1,"Easily one of the worst films of the 1960s, or perhaps ever",1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,1039,"['had', 'distinct', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'dog', 'film', 'entire', 'week', '1960s', 'when', 'worked', 'usher', 'RKO', 'Kenmore', 'old', 'movie', 'palace', 'had', 'been', 'vaudeville', 'theatre', 'Flatbush', 'section', 'Brooklyn', 'now', 'long', 'gone', 'difficult', 'describe', 'awfulness', 'film', 'writing', 'direction', 'acting', 'phoney/chic', 'story', 'would-be', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'who', 'tried', 'buy', 'Oscar', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'least', 'likely', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'history', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'one', 'earliest', 'films', 'open', 'pre-press', 'reviews', 'opened', 'Friday', 'hopes', 'one', 'would', 'read', 'Saturday', 'papers', 'avail', 'public', 'say', 'stayed', 'away', 'droves', 'lowest', 'many', 'low', 'points', 'film', 'put', 'nail', 'coffin', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'film', 'career', 'climactic', 'monologue', 'pop', 'singer', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'first', 'last', 'film', 'role', 'Hymie', 'Kelly', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'anti-hero', 'best', 'friend.This', 'film', 'not', 'available', 'DVD', 'be', 'glad']",The Oscar VHS

196904,A2PYKZQDBZJDL4,6300147487,"Page Turner ""book lover""","[0, 0]","I understand that the acting has been criticized in this movie, but I have to blame most of the issues on the script. Not to mention the direction. It is full of base clich&eacute;s, vanity and some counter intuitive character roles. I think Stephen Boyd was a pretty good actor, but his character is pretty one dimensional. He is much better when he plays a role with less vocalizations. In this movie he overacts to parody. Tony Bennett, skewered by critics, overplays as well. Some character nuances would have helped. Ironically, the studio head [Joseph Cotten] is portrayed as near decent. Milton Berle, also a near good guy role, as his agent, is completely straight in his portrayal. There are too many cameos and it sprawls. Some sections should have been edited out or rewritten. In the end it collapses on itself and there is no sympathy left for anyone. Pettiness reigns. Still liked it for some Old Hollywood meets New Hollywood.
