The characters are mere caricatures of people, we are ""told"" how we are supposed to feel by the constant insertion of melodramatic music, right on cue after certain ""pivotal"" moments, and the character transformations are superficial and scripted. This film comes across no greater than a typical Lifetime movie, and that's being generous.  It's frustrating because both the reviews of others and the previews depicted a potentially good story line.  And it had potential.  It was just delivered in such a shallow manner that it fails to achieve more than the slightest of emotional impact, and little credibility to boot.",2,sadly disappointing,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,685,"['potential', 'story', 'here', 'sullied', 'very', 'poor', 'storytelling', 'characters', 'are', 'mere', 'caricatures', 'people', 'are', 'told', 'how', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'constant', 'insertion', 'melodramatic', 'music', 'right', 'cue', 'certain', 'pivotal', 'moments', 'character', 'transformations', 'are', 'superficial', 'scripted', 'film', 'greater', 'typical', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'being', 'generous', 'frustrating', 'reviews', 'others', 'previews', 'depicted', 'potentially', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'had', 'potential', 'was', 'just', 'delivered', 'such', 'shallow', 'manner', 'achieve', 'more', 'slightest', 'emotional', 'impact', 'little', 'credibility', 'boot']",Mulligans
1219970,A2X29H96X7C3XJ,B001NGNLEW,"Blue in Washington ""Barry Ballow""","[9, 11]","""Mulligans"" can be rated in two ways.  As a gay genre, indy film, it gets four stars for examining an important story, for having an unusally attractive cast and for above average production values. The setting of film, which appears to be the Pocono or Adirondack Mountains, is beautiful and provides a potentially effective backdrop for the drama/trauma built into the story line.  The film's focus is on what happens to a closeted family man when he is forced to face his real sexual identity.  The awakening occurs when his college-age son brings a handsome gay friend to spend the summer with the family, presenting an emotional dilemma that rarely gets an intelligent examination in film.  So bravo for taking this on.Another way to consider ""Mulligans"" is as you would any film--indy or otherwise.  Doing it from this angle shows it wanting in several departments.  Even with the professional and mostly very likable cast, there was a real lack of credible connection between the characters of the story.  The emotional explosions that should come when the hookup by the father and the son's friend is discovered by the other members of the family, just don't happen.  The wonderful Thea Gill, as the brittle and betrayed wife, is not allowed to vent and ultimately plays contrary to the character that she has been in the first half of the film.The greatest lack of character connection is ironically between the two male characters who are presented as ""strongly"" drawn to each other.  There is ultimately no resolution to their attraction.  This is largely a problem of non-insightful direction and, at times, a lackluster script.This was an ambitious film that was visually attractive, but that could have been so much better with a stronger director and better screenplay.",3,Pretty and ambitious,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,1784,"['Mulligans', 'can', 'be', 'rated', 'two', 'ways', 'gay', 'genre', 'indy', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'examining', 'important', 'story', 'having', 'unusally', 'attractive', 'cast', 'above', 'average', 'production', 'values', 'setting', 'film', 'be', 'Pocono', 'Adirondack', 'Mountains', 'beautiful', 'potentially', 'effective', 'backdrop', 'drama/trauma', 'built', 'story', 'line', 'film', 'focus', 'what', 'closeted', 'family', 'man', 'when', 'forced', 'face', 'real', 'sexual', 'identity', 'awakening', 'when', 'college-age', 'son', 'handsome', 'gay', 'friend', 'spend', 'summer', 'family', 'presenting', 'emotional', 'dilemma', 'rarely', 'intelligent', 'examination', 'film', 'bravo', 'taking', 'on.Another', 'way', 'consider', 'Mulligans', 'would', 'film', 'indy', 'otherwise', 'Doing', 'angle', 'wanting', 'several', 'departments', 'Even', 'professional', 'mostly', 'very', 'likable', 'cast', 'was', 'real', 'lack', 'credible', 'connection', 'characters', 'story', 'emotional', 'explosions', 'should', 'come', 'when', 'hookup', 'father', 'son', 'friend', 'discovered', 'other', 'members', 'family', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'wonderful', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'brittle', 'betrayed', 'wife', 'not', 'allowed', 'vent', 'ultimately', 'contrary', 'character', 'been', 'first', 'half', 'film.The', 'greatest', 'lack', 'character', 'connection', 'ironically', 'two', 'male', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'presented', 'strongly', 'drawn', 'other', 'ultimately', 'resolution', 'attraction', 'largely', 'problem', 'non-insightful', 'direction', 'times', 'lackluster', 'script.This', 'was', 'ambitious', 'film', 'was', 'visually', 'attractive', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'stronger', 'director', 'better', 'screenplay']",Mulligans
1219971,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B001NGNLEW,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[3, 3]","Chase (played by Charlie David, who also wrote the screenplay) is spending the summer with a college best buddy, staying with him and his family at their summer house, while the two of them work at the local golf club.  Along with his friend Tyler, there are the precocious and impressionable younger sister, Birdy, their mother (played by Thea ""Queer As Folk"" Gill) and youngish-40's father, Nathan (played by Dan Payne).  After an uncomfortable evening at a house party with Tyler's friends, Chase feels the need to ""come out"" as gay to his friend, who is surprised but takes it relatively in stride.  Meanwhile, his father is fighting off his own attraction to Chase, as he had been repressing his latent sexuality since his marriage to his wife, when she was pregnant with Tyler.  When Tyler goes with his mom and sister to his grandmother's, leaving Chase and Nathan alone, the inevitable happens, and soon becomes evident to everyone else in the house.  The family struggles to deal with this revelation, initially blaming it all on Chase's presence in the home.(If you're wondering, by the way, the title ""Mulligans"" comes from a term in golf, which is essentially a chance to do something over again, if you didn't get it right the first time.  Lots of folks needing a ""do-over"" in this story!)Far from an original concept, but presented by an excellent cast in a well-written and beautifully-photographed film. Obviously, the film deals primarily with the issue of ""coming out"" late in life, as the father did here, but also illustrates how some individuals tend to blame people for simply being themselves.  Thought the ending was a bit abrupt, though realistic. Won several film festival awards, and deservingly so.  DVD extras include commentary tracks, cast interviews and deleted scenes.

1219981,A3KLCX1XYL9821,B001NGNLEW,Glenn_from_CT,"[44, 49]","""Mulligans"" is, for the most part, another one of those problematic, independent, gay-themed films that no major studio would touch.  Overall, it's not a bad movie... in fact, when it's good, it's really good.  You just have to get through the plodding first half to get to the good stuff.Let's knock out first what doesn't work here.  First off, Charlie David (Chase) and Derek Baynham (Tyler) are WAY too old for their parts.  They're supposed to be college kids on summer break, but they both look about 28 years old (which, in fact, they were when this film was made.)  This wouldn't be quite so bothersome if not for the fact that Tyler's parents, Nathan (Dan Payne) and Stacey (Thea Gill) look only about ten years older than him (which, in fact, they were when this film was made.)Next: the big, dumb, loud party scene.  `Nuff said.The biggest problem I had with ""Mulligans"" was that writer/producer/actor David clearly had it in mind that his character, Chase, was supposed to be the focal point of the story.  Considering the DVD box features his handsome mug 20 times larger than the family in the background, I'm easily led to believe that this was intended to be something of a vanity project.  Unfortunately, it probably became clear to him halfway through filming that Chase is only the catalyst here, and that the real story - the interesting one - involves the family going through a less-than-orthodox breakdown.Frankly, I didn't care about the character of Chase at all.  David's one-note acting didn't help the cause.  Neither did the fact that Chase is a painter... something that was done far more realistically and thoughtfully in ""Shelter"".  Here, it's just a clich&eacute; device to show how sensitive Chase is.  (Forget the fact that he embarks on an affair with his best friend's still-quite-married dad while mom is away visiting grandma.)  Chase would have made for a great ""bad guy"" here; instead, David chooses to make him come across as something of a nice-boy and a victim.  It's a weak choice that nearly unhinges the film.It all looks like it's going to go into the drink when something miraculous happens: the second half of the film.  Nathan is discovered and forced to come out, and suddenly the film takes on a third dimension.A lot of the credit for this amazing upturn is directly attributable to Dan Payne's subtle, aching performance.  He's given the impossible task of making us believe that a former high-school football player turned Porsche-driving stud-businessman-golfer could be hiding in the closet for years, and succeeds beautifully.  Yeh, it's unlikely this could happen, but with Payne helming the ship through its most unbelievable passages, it strikes us all as very real.I have to say that I didn't care for Thea Gill's performance as doting-wife-and-mom Stacey throughout the first half of the film.  She tries too hard to come across as a suburban phony, making for a lot of very forced moments.  But, once again, once Nathan's character is exposed, Gill drops the phony routine and shows us who Stacey really is: a bitter but realistic woman who is as tired of living a lie as Nathan is.

But ""Mulligans"" actually has a lot going for it, especially the understated performance of Dan Payne, a successful father in a seemingly perfect place in life, only to have it all unravel when his son's college friend Chase (Charlie David, who wrote the script) comes to stay with the family for the summer. Nathan (Mr Payne) and Chase become attracted to each other and one thing leads to another and they begin an affair. Mr. Payne is perfect in his expression of denial, confusion, and finally the acceptance of who he is. Less successful are Thea Gill (from ""Queer as Folk"") as Nathan's whiny, annoying wife and Derek James, as the typical hetero Stud who freaks when he discovers that his best friend is gay. Though the story moves slowly at times, it is beautifully photographed and both Mr Payne and Mr David are great eye  candy. Their love scene is a bit sterile, but effective enough.

1219985,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B001NGNLEW,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","I like the film but maybe not for the good reasons. I like it because it is both sentimental and at the same time tense and dramatic. I like it because in the end they all manage to accept the real facts, the gayness of Chase and the gayness of the father forced to be straight for 20 years and revealing itself during the vacation with wife and children as witnesses. To be gay is hard, we all know that, especially for someone who has not been able to experience that kind of love for twenty years in spite of what he felt and knew he was feeling.I like this situation and the way it is dealt with by all the protagonists. The first one to go big bang is the mother but she negotiates the obstacle rather fast. The son will come second but he will find it hard to accept it and make up with his best friend after all. The father has it hard because a door opened and he could not even control what was happening. He is the one who did not think one single minute. He fell in love and ga-douche-bag down it went. He needs some time to try to find out sex is sex and love is love and that there is an enormous chasm between the two because they are not even the same thing, not even close cousins. The mind and the heart on love's side and the endocrine hormonal glands on the other side. It is sad but understandable for a forced straight monk till the ripe age of 38.I like that piece of dialogue that reveals how hard it is in our society to just accept love is a passion of the mind and the heart and not of some other appended organs.Tyler is the son and Chase is his best friend, who is gay though Tyler does not know it yet.Tyler Davidson: I love you man, like a brother... just...Chase Rousseau: I know, no sword fights.Tyler Davidson: Maybe we can find a more macho way of saying it...Chase Rousseau: ...Go Steelers?Tyler Davidson: Yeah, Go Steelers, I like that. Go Steelers. Wow I never said I love you to a guy before.Chase Rousseau: Me either.Tyler Davidson: Good talk.But that's the reasons why I like the film but they are false reasons indeed. And the real reasons I should consider may make me dislike the film.The first one is that the older man falls in love with a younger man, his own son's best friend, at once, without hardly one moment of hesitation, without courting the younger man, having some value or quality time with him, exchanging ideas, feelings, emotions, literature or whatever that has nothing to do with sex but everything to do with knowing the other and letting the other know who you are. Within five minutes on the screen, without any exchange of anything but a few looks, the older man starts undressing the younger man. Things may happen like that but it does look and sound like rape or at least hygienic hormonal milking.  Sorry but I am a romantic somewhere and when two people meet, even if they fall in love at first sight, they have to spend some energy and time finding about each other, and they generally do. It is too much like: ""I am... I know. Hug, First kiss. Second kiss. Older man undresses younger man."" At least the older man does not seem to be shy, for a closet gay man for ever since his birth, he is catching up on the fast track.The second one, and this is a pattern in many films, is that the mother explodes first and then she is the first one to come to terms with the situation. She may pretend she knew the unexpressed sexual orientation of her husband, it does not explain the violence and then the acceptance. She should have been waiting for that moment of revelation, that epiphany all the time. I do not say she could have helped before it came all by itself, hence by accident, but she could not be surprised, not to mention angry and violent, even if only in words and packing a suitcase, because she knew it was going to come sooner or later in today's world of course. Twenty years ago things were different, but she lives in this here modern world with our TV and the Internet.The third one is the superficial acceptance of gayness, as long as it is abstract, by everyone, even the son who is told by Chase himself and in private that he is gay. As soon as it becomes real they all lose their footing. And this time again it is the mother who completely scatters her marbles with her younger daughter when on the beach the girl is looking at the penis that a friend of hers her age is showing her. Then she scatters them again because the girl is fond of her tennis instructor, a woman, after the first lesson. She is afraid of the word lesbian. And her defense is so weak: I have nothing against it but I do not want my daughter to be like that. And it is this mother who accepts after all rather easily her husband's gayness. Unbelievable. I am afraid that tolerant surface is there only to teach the audience a few lessons about the subject. It is pure ideological wrapping.But the film is quite entertaining, though we know from the very start who is who and who is going to go with whom.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Slightly weak because predictable,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,4994,"['like', 'film', 'maybe', 'not', 'good', 'reasons', 'sentimental', 'same', 'time', 'tense', 'dramatic', 'end', 'manage', 'accept', 'real', 'facts', 'gayness', 'Chase', 'gayness', 'father', 'forced', 'be', 'straight', '20', 'years', 'revealing', 'vacation', 'wife', 'children', 'witnesses', 'be', 'gay', 'hard', 'know', 'especially', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'experience', 'kind', 'love', 'twenty', 'years', 'spite', 'what', 'felt', 'knew', 'was', 'feeling.I', 'situation', 'way', 'dealt', 'protagonists', 'first', 'one', 'go', 'big', 'bang', 'mother', 'obstacle', 'rather', 'fast', 'son', 'will', 'come', 'second', 'will', 'find', 'hard', 'accept', 'make', 'up', 'best', 'friend', 'father', 'hard', 'door', 'opened', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'control', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'one', 'single', 'minute', 'fell', 'love', 'ga-douche-bag', 'went', 'time', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'sex', 'sex', 'love', 'love', 'enormous', 'chasm', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'thing', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'cousins', 'mind', 'heart', 'love', 'side', 'endocrine', 'hormonal', 'glands', 'other', 'side', 'sad', 'understandable', 'forced', 'straight', 'monk', 'ripe', 'age', '38.I', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'how', 'hard', 'society', 'just', 'accept', 'love', 'passion', 'mind', 'heart', 'not', 'other', 'appended', 'organs.Tyler', 'son', 'Chase', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'gay', 'Tyler', 'not', 'know', 'yet.Tyler', 'Davidson', 'love', 'man', 'brother', 'just', 'Chase', 'Rousseau', 'know', 'sword', 'Davidson', 'Maybe', 'can', 'find', 'more', 'macho', 'way', 'saying', 'Chase', 'Rousseau', 'Go', 'Steelers', 'Tyler', 'Davidson', 'Yeah', 'Go', 'Steelers', 'like', 'Go', 'Steelers', 'Wow', 'never', 'said', 'love', 'guy', 'before.Chase', 'Rousseau', 'Me', 'Davidson', 'Good', 'talk.But', 'reasons', 'why', 'like', 'film', 'are', 'false', 'reasons', 'indeed', 'real', 'reasons', 'should', 'consider', 'may', 'make', 'dislike', 'film.The', 'first', 'one', 'older', 'man', 'love', 'younger', 'man', 'own', 'son', 'best', 'friend', 'once', 'hardly', 'one', 'moment', 'hesitation', 'courting', 'younger', 'man', 'having', 'value', 'quality', 'time', 'exchanging', 'ideas', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'literature', 'whatever', 'nothing', 'do', 'sex', 'everything', 'do', 'knowing', 'other', 'letting', 'other', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'five', 'minutes', 'screen', 'exchange', 'anything', 'few', 'looks', 'older', 'man', 'undressing', 'younger', 'man', 'Things', 'may', 'happen', 'look', 'sound', 'rape', 'least', 'hygienic', 'hormonal', 'milking', 'Sorry', 'am', 'romantic', 'somewhere', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'meet', 'even', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'have', 'spend', 'energy', 'time', 'finding', 'other', 'generally', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'am', 'know', 'Hug', 'First', 'kiss', 'Second', 'kiss', 'Older', 'man', 'younger', 'man', 'least', 'older', 'man', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'shy', 'closet', 'gay', 'man', 'ever', 'birth', 'catching', 'up', 'fast', 'track.The', 'second', 'one', 'pattern', 'many', 'films', 'mother', 'first', 'then', 'first', 'one', 'come', 'terms', 'situation', 'may', 'pretend', 'knew', 'unexpressed', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'husband', 'not', 'explain', 'violence', 'then', 'acceptance', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'moment', 'revelation', 'epiphany', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'came', 'all', 'hence', 'accident', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'not', 'mention', 'angry', 'violent', 'even', 'only', 'words', 'packing', 'suitcase', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'come', 'sooner', 'later', 'today', 'world', 'course', 'Twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'things', 'were', 'different', 'here', 'modern', 'world', 'TV', 'Internet.The', 'third', 'one', 'superficial', 'acceptance', 'gayness', 'as', 'long', 'abstract', 'everyone', 'even', 'son', 'who', 'told', 'Chase', 'private', 'gay', 'As', 'soon', 'real', 'lose', 'footing', 'time', 'again', 'mother', 'who', 'completely', 'marbles', 'younger', 'daughter', 'when', 'beach', 'girl', 'looking', 'penis', 'friend', 'hers', 'age', 'showing', 'Then', 'again', 'girl', 'fond', 'tennis', 'instructor', 'woman', 'first', 'lesson', 'afraid', 'word', 'lesbian', 'defense', 'so', 'weak', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'daughter', 'be', 'mother', 'who', 'rather', 'easily', 'husband', 'gayness', 'Unbelievable', 'am', 'afraid', 'tolerant', 'surface', 'there', 'only', 'teach', 'audience', 'few', 'lessons', 'subject', 'pure', 'ideological', 'wrapping.But', 'film', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'know', 'very', 'start', 'who', 'who', 'who', 'going', 'go', 'whom.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Mulligans

1219996,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B001NGNLEW,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[6, 8]","........no, wait.......actually it was more of an admonishment----arising from my having read/viewed teasers and trailers of this already released film and my concerns over how the ""final outcome"" of older male character, 'Nathan,' would be handled (read my comments about this, and to Charlie, in the following).I said this on Imdb.com's Boards concerning this movie:""I've learned that, perhaps, the main thrust of ""Mulligans"" will be a family-themed thing, as opposed to an ends happily ever after romance. But, if so, no way do I want to see this older man (Payne's character) left high and dry after discovering who he 'really is'......""I, then, left this postscript to a message I placed for Charlie David on his Imdb.com Boards:""PS: I am SO looking forward to this film. But if, at its end, you leave ""him"" stuck high and dry (you know exactly who and what I'm talking about), it will be very hard for me to forgive you.""((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form.  Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again).  Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or your comments/reviews at major online film sales or review sites.  Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em).  Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and some ""near-addictive"" as well).  For some movies, I'll share a review with you, as follows.  Thanks for sticking with me so far.))To all you folks continuing to read this review here on Amazon.com, I am most happy to report that the above Imdb.com expressed concerns were baseless, and Charlie's writing fulfilled every hope I had for the handling of 'Nathan's' future life. He was, after all, to have his chance. Read on now to learn more of my impressions of this film.As to the overall theme / tenor of this production, it is NOT a romance film......or love story. Instead it is a ""lesson"" film.....a finding one's self film.....a coming to accept one's self film. More, it is as much about young friendship lost and regained as it is about finding / admitting who you are.....but with the latter subject being particularly well-handled (in fact David's writing approach could serve as a model of its kind). Continuing, here are some points of the film which strike me:- Charlie's 'Chase' stands out as being the ""PC"" for 'Nathan' beginning his journey of discovering who he really is (no, computer folks, those two initials stand for ""Proverbial Catalyst"").- Lotsa likes + 1 DISlike: My only fast-forward when watching this DVD is a too long and distracting party scene (like 100s in other movies / TV), taking time that could be better spent on the 'Chase - Nathan' relationship (sadly, only a mere 14 out of this 92 minute film has them in one on one scenes).- I think first-time, full length film director, Chip Hale, has a way to go yet. His work here doesn't measure up to that of another first-timer, Jonah Markowitz, of ""Shelter"" renown (in ""our"" circles, that is).  Plus, as a lover of DVD voice-over commentary, I was disappointed here at more time spent joking around (Baynham, particularly) and less on plot point explanations and discussion of emotional difficulties arising in shooting various scenes (more control, Mr. Director).- If any of we romantics out here are disappointed over film's end handling of the ""Chase / Nathan relationship,"" perhaps we only need realize that, truth be told, 'Nathan' does not need another son (think age of these parties). Instead, what we can hope for is that his new journey will find him a loving someone who is both sure and settled-in as to who he is---in other words, an ""experienced"" guide for our 'Nathan.' And I think that Charlie's film-end writing, which shows us 'Nathan' venturing out alone in his car, beginning his further search for himself, is all the indication we need, not just of this story's end, but its beginnings).As far as this movie lover's overall impression of individual acting performances, just let me say:- Charlie David (sexy as hell): Although having acted in film a while now, for some reason he comes across as being something of a ""newbie"".....leaving me a sense of his not being able to completely settle into a role (thought I saw the same thing in ""Dante's Cove"" series). Maybe there are too many expectations when writing and acting in one's own movie.  On the other hand, I must acknowledge he may have adopted this approach to put across the obvious discomfort we'd expect he might be experiencing when thrown into the unfamiliar and seemingly tight and loving Davidson family scene. I certainly do think he has growth potential.- Dan Payne: All I can say is Wow!! What a moving performance from someone put into the most difficult of storyline situations----yet with what perfect ease he delivers to us. He makes 'Nathan' come vividly alive in the most heartrending and confused manner. As a viewer you want to comfort him in your arms. And, oh, those eyes (NO one else in the bizness has THOSE dark, liquid eyes). I'm drowning.....I'm drown..... DOn't save me.....don't sav..... Ahem, and now I snap myself back into awareness and go on to simply admit I'm unduly influenced by this beautiful man's appearance and exciting sexuality. He's got ""it"".....and without even having to resort to a ""Charlie David shower scene.""- Thea Gill: Interesting to me that this particular actress was chosen to play a wife finding herself in this type situation. Because of her many past gay-friendly works, would she be able to effectively display the expected reactions of someone forced into her position of discovery? In your opinion, did she? Oh, and what appeared to me to be her initial over the top reactions to things ""gay,"" I later came to realize was her character being set up for what lay ahead. So in the end, she surprises the heck out of us by the acceptance she brings herself to be able to express (and dare I even mention that ""big bomb"" of suspicion she's been holding in her head about a certain someone's lifelong feelings---a bomb she unexpectedly unleashes on us----whoa!).- Derek Baynham (Tyler) & Grace Vukovic (Birdy): One a lot of fun and one cute as a button. No, actually two a lot of fun and two cute as a button. Tyler's big brother to little sister, Birdy, was about the only ""fun part"" of this otherwise serious movie. But when the two of them, separately or together, got it going, they really made us feel better, didn't they? It's easy to see that Mr. Baynham (a little bit wild and bit of a riot) can be expected to show up more in future. And as far as what lies ahead for Gracey, all I can say is: move over, Abigail Breslin (""Definitely, Maybe"" / ""Nim's Island""), somebody else is ready to step in.***This film will join others on my

1220001,A3I312N7ISZ960,B001NGNLEW,"Mr. Nicholas Pearson ""Cert HE (Open)""","[0, 0]","Having seen the talented Charlie David as a primary character in the guilty pleasure gay-themed supernatural soap drama 'Dante's Cove', and within other independent films, such as 'A Four Letter Word' and 'Kiss the Bride', amongst others, I was thrilled to see that he had turned his hand to writing and producing regarding his newest venture called 'Mulligans'. Charlie wrote the screenplay for this feature film, which centres around the theme of second chances using the golf-analogy of a mulligan, with interconnecting themes of family dynamics, brotherly friendship and the suppression of sexual orientation.The film stars Charlie David as Chase and Derek James as Tyler Davidson, who are best friends spending the summer together at Tyler's parents' lakeside home. Whilst there, Chase decides to come out as gay to his best friend, and the Davidson family are thrust into a situation wherein they are forced to confront long-suppressed feelings of guilt and complacency. Tyler's mother, Stacie, (portrayed by the brilliant Thea Gill of 'Queer as Folk' fame) is determined to be the perfect housewife and mother to both Tyler and youngest daughter Birdie, played by newcomer Grace Vukovic, who delivers her role splendidly with innocent questioning of the world around her. Stacie's husband and Tyler's father, Nathan (played by Dan Payne) seems to be more interested in his golfing hobby of late which is an annoyance to his wife, who suspects that that their marriage might be suffering due to a lack of communication. Events unfold between Nathan and Chase, with Nathan ultimately admitting hidden feelings that he has suppressed throughout his marriage.The DVD, released in 2009 and distributed by Wolfe Video/Border2Border Entertainment, is a simple affair, with 2.0 Dolby Digital sound and a widescreen frame format. The film was recorded in HD (as stated within the audio commentary), so the quality of the picture on the standard DVD release is fairly clean and bright throughout the feature. Regarding special features, there is an option to view the film with an audio commentary featuring the two main actors Charlie David and Derek James, alongside director Chip Hale, which serves as a decent look into Charlie's writing/acting motivation and the overall production process. This commentary is also available whilst watching the deleted scenes, which aid in linking specific scenes and seeing additional character progression, especially regarding Jarod, Chase's friend and confidant who is portrayed as straight in the feature, but was originally intended to be gay (which is also prevalent in the novelisation of the film - also written by Charlie David). There is also the option to view the film with subtitles (closed captions) and a small selection of interviews with the cast and crew, alongside a campaign advertisement for 'JointheDot.com''Mulligans' is a film which can seem somewhat predictable from the outset, but inevitably explores important themes that have been untouched in recent years, such as how the expectations of the world twenty or so years ago has affected those who have found themselves stuck in situations which seem out of their control. Within this film, Chase becomes the catalyst to give Nathan back that control in order to do what is right for both himself and for his family, with unfortunate mistakes made on both sides. The outcome is the aftermath of those consequences, but is somewhat comforting in its own right. However, it can sometimes feel as if the characters are being glossed over too quickly, and it is hard to get an exact focus on the overall picture, with far too many questions being left unanswered.Essentially, 'Mulligans' is a quaint film with good intentions of exploring complicated issues within a family unit, adding a gay-themed element that has probably affected quite a lot of people in similar situations. However, it can sometimes feel as if the focus is shifting a little too erratically between characters and plot elements for the viewer to grasp full believability and sentiment towards the people involved. That is not to say that I would not recommend this film though, as fans of Charlie David will no doubt enjoy his first outing as script writer of what is, essentially, a rather moving and enjoyable story about life choices, relationships and, above all else, second chances.As an accompaniment to this DVD release, I would most definitely recommend looking at the novelisation of the film, which is also written by Charlie David as his first outing as novelist/author, providing a much more intimate glimpse into the lives and inner turmoil of the main characters, whilst exploring certain story elements and plot devices that didn't have such prevalence within the main production. Ultimately, I found that reading the book gave me a deeper appreciation of the movie; providing an empathetic link that is maybe not so easy to grasp by simply watching the feature production

The foreshadowing seemed rather perfunctory. The wife didn't have a problem with gay, but only the infidelity.  Having seen multiple families go through scenarios of finding out a husband (or less frequently, wife) is gay, none I have witnessed have come to terms so quickly--or easily.

It is definitely more vanity project, unfortunately it is vanity unworthy to be celebrated.Thea Gill does a good job here, she is a consistently good actress, though not a great one.  But though I become aware her character is somewhat mournful she doesn't have an exciting sex life going for herself, it seems she knows why and is at ease with it.  Though we don't get as into her (mother) character that much, she is the most interesting one.The actors playing her son and his best friend (another best friends and roommates scenario where the straight guy doesn't know his buddy is gay, so just how much do they ""love"" each other with no trust involved, seems a friendship lacking in depth) are way too old for their characters, so that might be vanity-number one (or two, considering it's the parents in the story who are the more interesting characters, and consequently they are short-changed in the scenario).Charlie David is featured on the box and is playing someone too young for his age, and it shows.  Also he is a dreadful actor, though to give him credit he is less lame as usual here, though still irritating.  Somebody has the idea he can carry a film or has star quality to make up for lack of talent, and he doesn't.  Still, the character he plays is hopeless, more cypher than anything, and the character has no rhyme, sense or reason, and therefore we have no empathy with this guy, in fact find him disagreeable.  So chalk this up to more vanity, as obviously David must have thought his character worth playing, and presumably sympathetic.Another irritating aspect is the characters have ""trendy"" names like Chase.  I mean, how many people do you meet in real life have names like the characters in this film?  Bad novel writers go with trendy names, not good films.The way-out proof in the casting is possibly the best casting choice, the actor playing the dad.  But he has one immensely distracting aspect, he is a slightly older better looking version of Charlie David, so was the casting of the dad yet another example of vanity?  Because it was distracting for me as the ""son"" in the film looked nothing like the dad (almost expected a soap storyline to follow re true parentage) yet the lover of the dad ends up looking too similar to him so it came off less gay love story than narcissism.",2,coulda shoulda woulda,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,2414,"['Probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'conceit', 'basic', 'plot', 'characters', 'definitely', 'more', 'vanity', 'project', 'unfortunately', 'vanity', 'unworthy', 'be', 'celebrated.Thea', 'Gill', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'consistently', 'good', 'actress', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'become', 'aware', 'character', 'somewhat', 'mournful', ""n't"", 'have', 'exciting', 'sex', 'life', 'going', 'why', 'ease', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'mother', 'character', 'much', 'most', 'interesting', 'one.The', 'actors', 'playing', 'son', 'best', 'friend', 'best', 'friends', 'roommates', 'scenario', 'where', 'straight', 'guy', ""n't"", 'know', 'buddy', 'gay', 'so', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'do', 'love', 'other', 'trust', 'involved', 'friendship', 'lacking', 'depth', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'characters', 'might', 'be', 'vanity-number', 'one', 'two', 'considering', 'parents', 'story', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'consequently', 'are', 'short-changed', 'scenario', '.Charlie', 'David', 'featured', 'box', 'playing', 'someone', 'too', 'young', 'age', 'Also', 'dreadful', 'actor', 'give', 'credit', 'less', 'lame', 'usual', 'here', 'still', 'irritating', 'Somebody', 'idea', 'can', 'carry', 'film', 'star', 'quality', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'talent', ""n't"", 'Still', 'character', 'hopeless', 'more', 'cypher', 'anything', 'character', 'rhyme', 'sense', 'reason', 'therefore', 'have', 'empathy', 'guy', 'fact', 'find', 'disagreeable', 'So', 'chalk', 'up', 'more', 'vanity', 'obviously', 'David', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'character', 'playing', 'presumably', 'sympathetic.Another', 'irritating', 'aspect', 'characters', 'have', 'trendy', 'names', 'Chase', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'meet', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'names', 'characters', 'film', 'Bad', 'novel', 'writers', 'go', 'trendy', 'names', 'not', 'good', 'films.The', 'way-out', 'proof', 'casting', 'possibly', 'best', 'casting', 'choice', 'actor', 'playing', 'dad', 'one', 'immensely', 'distracting', 'aspect', 'slightly', 'older', 'better', 'looking', 'version', 'Charlie', 'David', 'so', 'was', 'casting', 'dad', 'yet', 'example', 'vanity', 'was', 'distracting', 'son', 'film', 'looked', 'nothing', 'dad', 'almost', 'expected', 'soap', 'storyline', 'follow', 're', 'true', 'parentage', 'yet', 'lover', 'dad', 'up', 'looking', 'too', 'similar', 'came', 'off', 'less', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'narcissism']",Mulligans

He plays Chase Rousseau who spends the summer with his best friend, Tyler Davidson (played by Derek Baynham) and his family at their summer home. All goes well and good until Chase tells Tyler that he's gay. Tyler accepts Chase's sexual orientation but he's not quite sure what it will mean to their friendship. Tyler tells his dad, Nathan Davidson (played by Dan Payne), about Chase's revelation. Nathan encourages him to continue being a good friend to Chase.An opportunity arises for Tyler, his sister, Birdie Davidson (played by Grace Vukovic) and his mother, Stacey Davidson (played by Thea Gill), to visit his maternal grandmother for a few days. Tyler invites Chase to come along but he decides to stay back at the house. So does Nathan. Over a barbecue Chase and Nathan discuss how life and the choices made were very different when Nathan was Chase's age. He was married to Stacey when they were 18 years old. Although it's not expressly stated one gets the distinct impression that, if Nathan had it to do all over again, he would be a gay man. Although he regrets his honesty with Chase at that moment and tells Chase he should leave him alone, eventually they make love together.Stacey, Tyler, and Birdie arrive home early. Had they arrived a hour or so earlier they would have found Nathan and Chase in the act. Even so, Stacey catches Nathan kiss Chase -- and the drama begins.I thought the story line completely believable and well-acted by all. It has a very satisfactory ending.
