After a bit of an awkward start, I have to say that I really did enjoy this movie.The movie follows Brian, a teen starting in Bristol &  excited to get a start on living life on his own. Brian is also eager to take part in his favorite tv show 'University Challenge', where the best & brightest from each college go head to head in intellectual combat. Once there, Brian meets two very different women- the blonde & wealthy Alice as well as the politically active Rebecca. Attracted to both of them, Brian finds himself drawn more to Alice even as things show that he is more compatible with Rebecca.The movie started off a little slow & for a while, I thought that maybe this would be the first time Netflix had recommended something I just didn't get into. Once the movie kicked into gear & I got a better feel for the characters, I was eagerly hoping for my favorite characters to have a happy ending.It's really the supporting characters that I enjoyed most in this film, such as Brian's mum's boyfriend Des, an ice cream salesman & the UC leader, Patrick. The main characters are all enjoyable & I liked that they weren't perfect or entirely at fault for everything. The characters are beautifully flawed in the ways that count. (The soundtrack is awesome as well!)Someone looking for the tons of fart & sex jokes that seem to be prevalent in most college romantic comedies will be disappointed. This isn't that type of film. If you want a movie where the characters are all beautiful & there's a definite good guy in it, this isn't that film either.

But the most important lesson he has to learn is that knowledge and wisdom are not the same thing.Brian quickly makes a strong impression in academia, especially when he gets onto the school team for University Challenge, the wildly popular quiz show he grew up watching with his father. But the rest of life isn't so easy: Brian falls head-over-heels for his beautiful but self-centered teammate Alice, who leads him on despite having no real interest in intimacy; his mother, now ten years widowed, has found a new lover; he just can't sort out his feelings for Rebecca, a student activist with more than a passing interest in him; his blue-collar mates from home are starting to regard him as a class traitor; and any time he tries to be clever or impulsive, it always goes awry.James McAvoy, who has already won great critical acclaim for his skills in dramatic roles, shows that he is equally adept in comedy, giving Brian an aw-shucks charm that keeps him loveable despite his penchant for saying exactly the wrong thing. Among the rest of the cast, the two greatest standouts are Benedict Cumberbatch, who steals his every scene as the hilariously snobbish team captain, and the extraordinarily talented Rebecca Hall, who plays Rebecca with such spirit and beauty that you can't help rooting for Brian to come around and realize that she's the one for him. Veteran thespians Charles Dance and Lindsay Duncan have a brilliant cameo as Alice's parents, and Mark Gatiss makes a convicing Bamber Gascoigne (the long-time host of University Challenge, and a real-life icon of British TV).The script is witty, and gives new twists to the traditional conventions of romantic comedy. The climax on the set of University Challenge, and an earlier scene involving a misguided reference to The Graduate, are particularly well done. I can't help feeling, though, that the movie missed a few good opportunities as well. I understand the need to streamline the story, but I can't help feeling that they streamlined too much: fun characters disappear not long after they're introduced, certain aspects of Brian's schoolyear are mentioned when they should have been shown, and so on.All the same, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and highly recommend it for any fans of romantic comedy, British film, or movies with cool '80s soundtracks.",4,"A charming, intelligent comedy about growing up",1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,2453,"['very', 'young', 'age', 'Brian', 'Jackson', 'crammed', 'mind', 'facts', 'knowledge', 'now', 'university', 'more', 'most', 'important', 'lesson', 'learn', 'knowledge', 'wisdom', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'thing.Brian', 'quickly', 'strong', 'impression', 'academia', 'especially', 'when', 'school', 'team', 'University', 'Challenge', 'wildly', 'popular', 'quiz', 'show', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'father', 'rest', 'life', ""n't"", 'so', 'easy', 'Brian', 'head-over-heels', 'beautiful', 'self-centered', 'teammate', 'Alice', 'who', 'having', 'real', 'interest', 'intimacy', 'mother', 'now', 'ten', 'years', 'widowed', 'found', 'new', 'lover', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sort', 'out', 'feelings', 'Rebecca', 'student', 'activist', 'more', 'passing', 'interest', 'blue-collar', 'mates', 'home', 'are', 'starting', 'regard', 'class', 'traitor', 'time', 'be', 'clever', 'impulsive', 'always', 'awry.James', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'already', 'won', 'great', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'skills', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'equally', 'adept', 'comedy', 'giving', 'Brian', 'aw-shucks', 'charm', 'loveable', 'penchant', 'saying', 'exactly', 'wrong', 'thing', 'rest', 'cast', 'two', 'greatest', 'standouts', 'are', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'who', 'scene', 'hilariously', 'snobbish', 'team', 'captain', 'extraordinarily', 'talented', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'who', 'Rebecca', 'such', 'spirit', 'beauty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'rooting', 'Brian', 'come', 'realize', 'one', 'Veteran', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'have', 'brilliant', 'cameo', 'Alice', 'parents', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'convicing', 'Bamber', 'Gascoigne', 'long-time', 'host', 'University', 'Challenge', 'real-life', 'icon', 'British', 'TV', '.The', 'script', 'witty', 'new', 'twists', 'traditional', 'conventions', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'climax', 'set', 'University', 'Challenge', 'earlier', 'scene', 'involving', 'misguided', 'reference', 'Graduate', 'are', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'though', 'movie', 'missed', 'few', 'good', 'opportunities', 'well', 'understand', 'need', 'streamline', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'streamlined', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'characters', 'disappear', 'not', 'long', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Brian', 'schoolyear', 'are', 'mentioned', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'so', 'same', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'British', 'film', 'movies', 'cool', ""'80s"", 'soundtracks']",N/A
655098,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B00005JPOH,Dai-keag-ity,"[3, 3]","This stylish and funny film does justice to David Nicholls' embraceably likable novel of the same name. (Though also released in the United States as A Question of Attraction.) Here James McAvoy plays Brian Jackson, a charmingly fallible young Englishman of working class origins who goes off to college in Bristol in the year 1985, and soon joins his school's quiz team, which is preparing to compete on the televised student game show, University Challenge. As he endures the usual first-year agonies and invents a few for himself, the trivia expert Jackson falls madly in love with the team's reigning beauty, the slightly conscienceless Alice Harbinson (an annoying but eye-catching Alice Eve) and meanwhile misses the obvious fact that he's much better suited for another girl, Rebecca Epstein, one of the campus' ever-protesting social leftists. The ups and downs of Brian's first year on campus, the pains of his growing up and moving apart from the life and people he'd always known, and the extent to which his driven involvement with the quiz team and its members (including a smug, victory obsessed captain) takes over his life make up the backbone of this coming of age love story. The soundtrack is almost a star in its own right, and features songs by The Cure, the Psychedelic Furs, The Smiths and other memorable eighties bands. Starter For Ten is such a fun, touching, likable presentation that I've reviewed it in three of its different incarnations here on Amazon (both the US and original release, plus now the film version) and in fact the very first Amazon review I ever did was for this novel. It's one of the best debut books I've come across in a long while, and the makers of this movie got darn near everything right.

Here he's Brian Jackson, a first year university student from a modest background who has always wanted to know ""the right answer.""  To that end, he applies and is accepted to a good university where he joins an intercollegiate quiz team.  In record time, he also manages to fulfill the first rule of starting school on your own: that you will make an idiot of yourself with both mind altering substances and people of the opposite gender, not necessarily in that order.  He's also not fully processed the death of his father, with whom he used to watch quiz shows, and with whom he never felt he fully connected.  Like other movies centering around a quiz show, the plot twist is fairly predictable.  But I didn't care because McAvoy is so engaging to watch. I didn't care that the love triangle - will the sexually-nave young man wind up with the blond bombshell with lots of cleavage or the quirky, politically-active brunette was only a surprise to someone who'd never seen a movie before.  I didn't care that they didn't even try to make some of the deus ex machinas remotely plausible (""He got hit by a bus!"")

Mushy-headed, he screws up the famous quiz bowl with an ethical lapse before clearing his head, finding the right girl and answering the big questions.  Catherine Tate plays his mother Julie Jackson, intent on finding a new romance after the son leaves home.  Off at college, Brian meets Alice Harbinson played by Alice Eve.

Brian Jackson (""Atonement""'s James McAvoy) is a brainy lad with an insatiable appetite for facts who leaves his home in Essex to attend university in Bristol.  Almost immediately, he becomes a member of the school's academic quiz team, falls madly in love with his drop-dead gorgeous teammate, Alice, and catches the eye of an earthy social crusader by the name of Rebecca.  Meanwhile, the team prepares for a trivia bowl competition to be broadcast on nationwide TV.Adapted by David Nicholls from his novel and directed by Tom Vaughan, ""Starter for 10"" has all the drollery, dryness and wit we've come to expect from the best of British humor.  McAvoy exudes a great deal of charisma as the intelligent young man who finds that shedding his lower-class origins and proving his smarts in a university setting is not going to be quite as easy as he thought it would be; and Dominic Cooper, Rebecca Epstein, Alice Eve and Benedict Cumberbatch match him in likeability and appeal.  The movie also playfully captures the sights and sounds of the era in which it is set, with crowds of placard-waving young people dressed in ""Flashdance"" and New Wave-inspired attire protesting everything from apartheid to pollution to nuclear proliferation while synthesizer-laden music pounds away in the background.But it is as a hilarious and insightful human comedy that the film earns our real attention and affection.

It is believable but yet entertaining to see within the eyes of how our rather lonely, troubled main character is dealing with.The film is quite different from most Hollywood films in that it consists mostly of a British cast and works much like a Bill Forsyth film like Gregory's Girl. Nothing in the film is too obscene or disgusting that you otherwise may find in American Pie or The Hangover which is in line with a PG-rated 80s comedy from John Hughes. Unfortunately, Hughes now that he passed away would appreciate the British way of doing things that are similar to his films that he has done too.A particularly underrated film, Starter for Ten is a film that many parents ought to recommend for their university-ready son or daughter. It is more heartfelt and realistic too in case you wonder.""",5,"Surprisingly effective, funny, and heartfelt university romantic comedy.
