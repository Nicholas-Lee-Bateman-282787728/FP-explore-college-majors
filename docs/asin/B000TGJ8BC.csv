1089926,A1XQVED2NX33TN,B000TGJ8BC,Catnip,"[0, 0]","This series is fantastic!  I got hooked the summer after the first year when they were playing out re-runs.  Got my family hooked as well; to the point were they no longer enjoy CSI Miami but would rather watch NCIS instead.  The difference?  NCIS is real and shows very different people working together.  Not robots monotonously doing the same thing each week.  The characters actually have 'character' and show emotion, love, respect and concern over each others feelings and wellbeing.  That is a real show.  Not just cool handed hollywood glam but hard working people doing a usually thankless job.  Plus, with the military aspect...makes it all the more enjoyable and different.",5,Lovin' it!,1226534400,"11 13, 2008",2008,684,"['series', 'fantastic', 'got', 'hooked', 'summer', 'first', 'year', 'when', 'were', 'playing', 'out', 're-runs', 'Got', 'family', 'hooked', 'as', 'well', 'point', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'enjoy', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'NCIS', 'instead', 'difference', 'NCIS', 'real', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'working', 'together', 'Not', 'robots', 'monotonously', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'week', 'characters', 'actually', 'have', ""'character"", 'show', 'emotion', 'love', 'respect', 'concern', 'others', 'feelings', 'wellbeing', 'real', 'show', 'Not', 'just', 'cool', 'handed', 'hollywood', 'glam', 'hard', 'working', 'people', 'doing', 'usually', 'thankless', 'job', 'military', 'aspect', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'different']",NCIS - Seasons 1-4
