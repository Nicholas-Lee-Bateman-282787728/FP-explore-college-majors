Oliveira""","[6, 9]","First of all I have to say that &quot;dog park&quot; is one of a kind when it comes to brig cute dogs to the screen, but on the other hand, the film has nothing new about relationships and love affairs.&quot;Dog...&quot; is about a man (Luke Wilson), whose beloved ex-girlfriend has given him over and taken the dog as souvenir. He meets a woman (Natasha Henstrige), and falls for her, but she is not very interested in having a love affair right now -- at least with him. And this is the way the movies goes... Nothing new or exciting -- apart from the dogs that could have had a much bigger part in this misguided flick.They are the stars and steal any scene they are in (Not that would have been a very difficult task due to the cast they acted with, but anyway they do steal). The pets are treatead as it they were a kid, so they go to 'school', go to a shrink and family sessions... and get graduated. But the human beings also wanted to have a part in the story and this is when the movie becomes a whole mess.Luke Wilson plays his usual role: the nice, a bit silly and single guy. Natasha Henstrige tries hard but can't avoid her femme fatale look. She palys a Mrs booksworm in a TV show, but she does not look like the kind of girl we expect to be reading for our children. Plus, they have no chermistry together, you don't give a damn if they'll get married or kill each other.Many directors have tried to copycat Altman, putting some characters together in a web that is revealed little by little. Some have succed, but many have failed. This film belongs to the second option. If this strategy is not well done, it looks like the characters of the movie are the only human beings on earth, and not that casuallity put them together.To sum up, if you really really really like dogs, watch this film but fastfoward the scenes which they are not in. And my two stars go, of course, to the canines!",2,Of Dogs and Men,1008115200,"12 12, 2001",2001,1905,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'quot', 'dog', 'park', 'quot', 'one', 'kind', 'when', 'brig', 'cute', 'dogs', 'screen', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'nothing', 'new', 'relationships', 'love', 'affairs.', 'quot', 'Dog', 'quot', 'man', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'beloved', 'ex-girlfriend', 'given', 'taken', 'dog', 'souvenir', 'woman', 'Natasha', 'Henstrige', 'not', 'very', 'interested', 'having', 'love', 'affair', 'right', 'now', 'least', 'way', 'movies', 'Nothing', 'new', 'exciting', 'apart', 'dogs', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'bigger', 'part', 'misguided', 'flick.They', 'are', 'stars', 'steal', 'scene', 'are', 'Not', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'difficult', 'task', 'due', 'cast', 'acted', 'anyway', 'do', 'steal', 'pets', 'are', 'treatead', 'were', 'kid', 'go', ""'school"", 'go', 'shrink', 'family', 'sessions', 'get', 'graduated', 'human', 'beings', 'also', 'wanted', 'have', 'part', 'story', 'when', 'movie', 'whole', 'mess.Luke', 'Wilson', 'usual', 'role', 'nice', 'bit', 'silly', 'single', 'guy', 'Natasha', 'Henstrige', 'hard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'femme', 'fatale', 'look', 'palys', 'Mrs', 'booksworm', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'look', 'kind', 'girl', 'expect', 'be', 'reading', 'children', 'have', 'chermistry', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', ""'ll"", 'get', 'married', 'kill', 'other.Many', 'directors', 'have', 'tried', 'copycat', 'Altman', 'putting', 'characters', 'together', 'web', 'revealed', 'little', 'little', 'have', 'succed', 'many', 'have', 'failed', 'film', 'second', 'option', 'strategy', 'not', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'human', 'beings', 'earth', 'not', 'casuallity', 'put', 'together.To', 'sum', 'up', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'like', 'dogs', 'watch', 'film', 'fastfoward', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'two', 'stars', 'go', 'course', 'canines']",N/A

Hartley,"[4, 6]","An amiable, if hit-and-miss treatise on modern dating angst from the same off-kilter Canucks who gave us &quot;Brain Candy&quot;. &quot;Kids In The Hall&quot; alumnus Bruce McColloch directs this romantic comedy about dogs and (mostly) the silly creatures who own them. Luke Wilson (who co-starred with brother Owen in &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;) is appealing as the central character and Natasha Henstridge is charming as his love interest. One major disappointment-the usually dependable Janeanne Garafalo puzzlingly seems to be acting in a different movie than her co-stars, although that could be due to McCulloch's tendency toward uneven directing. While the dog psychiatrist is somewhat amusing (Paul Mazursky thought of it first), the character that almost steals the movie is the &quot;Eye Contact&quot; guy, an overly-sensitive New Age-type goofball who is screamingly funny in every scene he's in.

Written by, directed by, and starring Bruce McCulloch (Kids in the Hall), it's an examination of love, fidelity, and dating for grown-ups.

The cast is full of people who are almost A-list, and they either give performances equal to their best (Janeane Garofalo and Luke Wilson) or surprising in their depth and restraint (Natasha Hentsridge and Harlan Williams).

The plot focus on relationships and shows how hard it is to find the ONE in your life. Andy (Luke Wilson) is a guy who has just broke with his girlfriend (Kathleen Roberson), and who misses the dog they have, who now lives with her. Kind of depressed, he tries to find comfort in a single's bar, where he meets Lorna (Natasha Henstridge) who is also feeling lonely. After a disastrous first date, they stop seeing each other, trying to meet new and interesting people, which may seems hard. This film proves that whenever you want to find someone to love, you just have to be opened to the least expected possibilities.This movie has very inteligent dialogues, and weird theories about relationships, like the &quot;dating chain&quot;(watch to find out what it is!).

37175,A1ZK7W9TI81PXL,0780629876,slayde222,"[0, 0]","As a huge dog lover and an avid dog park enthusiast, I could readily recognize the funny and amusing truths in this movie. In fact, with better pacing and a tighter script, this film could have been hysterical and highly entertaining. While a couple of the actors really mine the humor in their respective characters (for instance, Mark McKinney as an uber-committed ""dog therapist""), the finished product -- unfortunately -- seems a little sloppy and flat.I think some of that has to do with first-time director Bruce McCulloch, a talented ""Kids in the Hall"" alum who in the past (like fellow KITH-er McKinney) has demonstrated a great sense of comic timing. Here though, he seems to struggle with achieving a tight narrative, an even tone, and a balanced set of performances across his relatively large ensemble cast. For instance, Janeane Garofalo is clearly playing against type as the grounded Jeri, but she seems so subdued here that her signature snark is almost snuffed out completely. Luke Wilson is handsome and likeable in virtually every role he takes on, but here I found his chemistry with Natasha Henstridge as flat as visual wallpaper. In fact, many of the characters seem to wander somewhat aimlessly from scene to scene (and from bed to bed). Shows like ""Seinfeld"" have proven that this approach can be highly entertaining -- but movies like ""Dog Park"" suggest it's much harder to pull off than it looks.All in all, this isn't an unpleasant viewing experience -- and the dogs, in their various scenes and transitions, admittedly steal the show. The movie as a whole is light as fluff, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But many of the situations and speeches (such as the drawn-out ""dating chain"" theory) seem just a little too contrived, forced, over-scripted, and/or unrealistic. Maybe this is a better way to put it: While I loved every one of the pooches, I didn't find myself rooting for (or really even caring about) the humans. And when it comes to Luke Wilson and Janeane Garofalo, that's saying a lot.",2,"The dogs are adorable; the humans are ""meh""",1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,2032,"['huge', 'dog', 'lover', 'avid', 'dog', 'park', 'enthusiast', 'could', 'readily', 'recognize', 'funny', 'amusing', 'truths', 'movie', 'fact', 'better', 'pacing', 'tighter', 'script', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hysterical', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'couple', 'actors', 'really', 'mine', 'humor', 'respective', 'characters', 'instance', 'Mark', 'McKinney', 'uber-committed', 'dog', 'therapist', 'finished', 'product', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'sloppy', 'flat.I', 'think', 'do', 'first-time', 'director', 'Bruce', 'McCulloch', 'talented', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'alum', 'who', 'past', 'fellow', 'KITH-er', 'McKinney', 'demonstrated', 'great', 'sense', 'comic', 'timing', 'Here', 'struggle', 'achieving', 'tight', 'narrative', 'even', 'tone', 'balanced', 'set', 'performances', 'relatively', 'large', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'instance', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'clearly', 'playing', 'type', 'grounded', 'Jeri', 'so', 'subdued', 'here', 'signature', 'snark', 'almost', 'snuffed', 'out', 'completely', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'handsome', 'likeable', 'virtually', 'role', 'here', 'found', 'chemistry', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'as', 'flat', 'visual', 'wallpaper', 'fact', 'many', 'characters', 'seem', 'wander', 'somewhat', 'aimlessly', 'scene', 'scene', 'bed', 'bed', 'Seinfeld', 'have', 'proven', 'approach', 'can', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'Dog', 'Park', 'suggest', 'much', 'harder', 'pull', 'off', ""n't"", 'unpleasant', 'viewing', 'experience', 'dogs', 'various', 'scenes', 'transitions', 'admittedly', 'steal', 'show', 'movie', 'whole', 'light', 'fluff', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'many', 'situations', 'speeches', 'such', 'drawn-out', 'dating', 'chain', 'theory', 'seem', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'contrived', 'forced', 'over-scripted', 'and/or', 'unrealistic', 'Maybe', 'better', 'way', 'put', 'loved', 'one', 'pooches', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'rooting', 'really', 'even', 'caring', 'humans', 'when', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'saying', 'lot']",N/A
