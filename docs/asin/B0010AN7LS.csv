During a lunch break, Mason meets and is befriended by a manic depressive Amber (Amber Tamblyn), and the two proceed to draw close to one another during a series of painting sessions. It is here the the story begins to ""spiral"", leading Amber and Mason both a path which has a dark conclusion.The acting in this movie is brilliant, and I do not say that lightly. The script is amazingly constructed, paced perfectly, and drawing you deeply into the lives of the main characters and their attraction for one another. You care about these people, and truly want the best for them.

1124974,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B0010AN7LS,Brad Baker,"[8, 11]","Anchor Bay's new release of 2007's ""Spiral"" is touted as a ""Hitchcock-Tale"" on the DVD cover. But this is no ""Hitchcock"".  ""Spiral"" does contain some good acting, a few great shots of Portland, and a cute trick ending.  Mason(Joel David Moore) is a slouchy loser who loves jazz and sells insurance over the phone.  He appears to enjoy painting women. He's often nervous, and there's a room in his apartment he refuses to enter. What could be in there? Mason is a loner, and his only friend at work is his boss, Berkeley(Zachary Levi). One day, a young woman named Amber(Amber Tamblyn) sits beside Mason at lunch.  They become friends. Mason convinces her to pose for a painting. Clothes are optional.  But his behavior becomes erratic, and Amber begins to suspect that Mason may be dangerous.  ""Spiral"" Star Joel David Moore doesn't quite cut it in the leading role here. Though effective, his twitchy learing is too one-dimensional to carry this movie. Amber Tambly is fine as the girl, but a stronger director might have molded a stronger performance.  However, Zachary Levi, as Berkeley, is poised and well-timed, confident and cool. The ""Spiral"" screenplay is spotty.  It lacks motivation. Why is Mason's telemarketer-boss his friend and protector? Mason reveals no compassion to warrant such friendship. His basic emotion is contempt. And why is the young Amber attracted to the skinny, awkward geek?  Promos reveal ""Spiral"" as a feature-length indie adapted from a 13-minute short. The budget is small, and sometimes it looks it. The highlight of ""Spiral"" occurs half-way, as a huge tracking shot, from a roof-top party, displays a colorful night-time panorama of Portland.  The DVD has been letterboxed at 1.78:1 and the transfer is enhanced for 16 x 9 TV's. The image is sharp and clear, with no grain or defects from the source material. Colors are good. Mason's hallucination scenes provide a nice blend of surround and subwoofer effects. Extras include an audio commentary with the director, producer, and writer, ""Spinning Spiral: The Making of Spiral( 8 minutes)"", ""Cinefile Promo"", and three trailers.  Amber Tamblyn is managed by her father, actor Russ Tamblyn, who zoomed to fame by starring in 1961's classic ""West Side Story"".

Just as she begins to break down his barriers and he begins to show signs of life while painting her portraits, Amber discovers that she may not be the first person to see the tip of his paintbrush, though she may be the last... Joel David Moore is perfectly fitting as Mason, delivering the cold and empty performance that the role required. The steady build allows Amber and the viewer ample time to get in to Mason's head, but just as he starts to open up to become a likable character, a sudden reveal immediately ramps up the terror and turns the tables on our social misfit. Moore's writing and direction under Adam Green's supervision demonstrate a great deal of potential here, and are aided by crisp visuals and expert framing. Mason's declining mental state is alluded to on screen in a series of visual metaphors seen in the approaching storm, electrical outages, and increasingly shaky camera work.

The boss drinks on the job and flirts with his female co-workers to such an extent he would have been fired for sexual harrassment.  Mason, the main character, is so strange and unattractive it is hard to believe that the woman he becomes involved with would give him the time of day.  This film was very different from ""Hatchet"".  It was slow, moody, and very restrained whereas ""Hatchet"" was all about excess.  I have to say that I was never really bored but I was checking the clock a few times.  Then, the last ten minutes of the film hit me and earned this film an extra star.

1124978,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0010AN7LS,C. Sawin,"[1, 1]","Mason isn't exactly your everyday joe. He's an artist. A sketcher and a painter, but he's also incredibly quiet and tends to keep to himself. He has an office job where he tries to sell car insurance, but he doesn't exactly fit in with others. His only friend(if that's what you want to call him) is Berkeley, the boss. Berkeley comes off like he cares about Mason, but his compassion is overshadowed by the fact that he's a prick. Things start looking up for Mason as he meets Amber. After seeing Mason's sketches and getting to know him a little better, she decides she wants him to paint her. Mason's...odd side starts to reveal itself as he won't let Amber see his sketches. ""There are rules,"" he says, ""You can't see it until it's done."" As Amber gets closer to Mason, what can he be hiding? Why is he such an ""enigma,"" as Amber put it? Why does he keep having disturbing dreams about another woman?Where do I start? I actually really liked this. I was expecting to as Adam Green and Joel David Moore were both involved with Hatchet, which is a guilty pleasure of mine. While Hatchet is half comedy and half gorefest, Spiral is more of a dramatic thriller that builds towards the ending. Spiral, while being low budget, is shot in superb fashion. The way its shot is actually its charm. I love the way the camera gets shaky during the scenes where Mason seems like he's going to lose it or when he finally does. Joel David Moore is also in top form here. His talent truly shines in this role. Everything from his body language to the way he chomps his teeth when he gets nervous, he sucks you in. You wind up feeling sorry for Mason even though you know he's twisted in some way. Witnessing his character unveil how dark really is is just amazing. The other actor I was really impressed with was Zachary Levi. I wound up becoming a fan of his with Chuck, but I've never seen him like this. He's basically a prick with a heart(even though that side of him is really only shown to Mason). While his role is a little small, he's still able to steal a few scenes...especially in the last half of the film. The other element that really adds to the film is the jazz music used. It fits perfectly with Mason's personality. Jazz music accentuates Mason's insanity that nothing else could. I really have nothing bad to say about the film.This may surprise a few people, but Spiral is actually quite enjoyable. The acting is top notch and it's written incredibly well. For a movie that went straight to DVD, it's quite surprising how good it actually is. Even if you hated Hatchet, you should give Spiral a chance as it's a completely different kind of film.Rating: 7/10",4,A Surprisingly Good Film,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,2666,"['Mason', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'everyday', 'joe', 'artist', 'sketcher', 'painter', 'also', 'incredibly', 'quiet', 'keep', 'office', 'job', 'where', 'sell', 'car', 'insurance', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fit', 'others', 'only', 'friend', 'what', 'want', 'call', 'Berkeley', 'boss', 'Berkeley', 'Mason', 'compassion', 'overshadowed', 'fact', 'prick', 'Things', 'start', 'looking', 'up', 'Mason', 'Amber', 'seeing', 'Mason', 'sketches', 'getting', 'know', 'little', 'better', 'paint', 'Mason', 'odd', 'side', 'reveal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'Amber', 'see', 'sketches', 'are', 'rules', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'done', 'Amber', 'closer', 'Mason', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'hiding', 'Why', 'enigma', 'Amber', 'put', 'Why', 'keep', 'having', 'disturbing', 'dreams', 'woman', 'Where', 'do', 'start', 'actually', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'expecting', 'Adam', 'Green', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'were', 'involved', 'Hatchet', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mine', 'Hatchet', 'half', 'comedy', 'half', 'gorefest', 'Spiral', 'more', 'dramatic', 'thriller', 'ending', 'Spiral', 'being', 'low', 'budget', 'shot', 'superb', 'fashion', 'way', 'shot', 'actually', 'charm', 'love', 'way', 'camera', 'shaky', 'scenes', 'where', 'Mason', 'going', 'lose', 'when', 'finally', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'also', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'talent', 'truly', 'role', 'Everything', 'body', 'language', 'way', 'teeth', 'when', 'nervous', 'wind', 'up', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'Mason', 'even', 'know', 'twisted', 'way', 'Witnessing', 'character', 'unveil', 'how', 'dark', 'really', 'just', 'amazing', 'other', 'actor', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'was', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'wound', 'up', 'becoming', 'fan', 'Chuck', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'basically', 'prick', 'heart', 'even', 'side', 'really', 'only', 'shown', 'Mason', 'role', 'little', 'small', 'still', 'able', 'steal', 'few', 'scenes', 'especially', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'other', 'element', 'really', 'film', 'jazz', 'music', 'used', 'perfectly', 'Mason', 'personality', 'Jazz', 'music', 'Mason', 'insanity', 'nothing', 'else', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'nothing', 'bad', 'say', 'film.This', 'may', 'surprise', 'few', 'people', 'Spiral', 'actually', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'written', 'incredibly', 'well', 'movie', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'quite', 'surprising', 'how', 'good', 'actually', 'Even', 'hated', 'Hatchet', 'should', 'give', 'Spiral', 'chance', 'completely', 'different', 'kind', 'film.Rating', '7/10']",Spiral

I will grant the fact that the film moves at a leisurely pace that some might find boring, and people who have lived their whole lives immersed in the ""in crowd"" might look down their noses at the protagonist without even making an effort to sympathize with (let alone relate to) him, but this is a very human story that cuts far too wide a swath across the emotional landscape to be pigeonholed into any one constraining genre.  Maybe some viewers were expecting more of an actual horror film along the lines of Hatchet, since Spiral reunites co-writer Joel David Moore and co-director Adam Green from that earlier project, but these guys are obviously true filmmakers devoted to their craft and determined to spread their wings rather than settle for churning out one slasher after another.Spiral's story revolves around Mason (Joel David Moore), a troubled fellow who is so far out of the mainstream he makes me look normal and popular.  Our first encounter with him shows just how vulnerable and possibly deranged he is, and this image is further reinforced by the mysterious dark secret lurking behind one of the doors in his apartment and the frightening visions that haunt his dreams.  At work, he seems incapable of actually associating with anyone other than his boss and long-time friend Berkeley (Zachary Levi) - until, that is, a new employee named Amber (Amber Tamlyn) decides to join him on his lonely bench during lunch and strikes up a friendship with him.  Amber's a hard nut to crack; spontaneous and outwardly emotional (not to mention hot), she's the very opposite of Mason, yet she obviously likes him despite all of his obvious problems.  Their awkward friendship slowly grows into a more meaningful relationship when she begins posing for Mason, who is quite the artist.  In fact, art seems to be the one safe refuge that Mason can cling to in life - actually, safe may not be the right word, for his sketches and paintings reveal troubling portents of obsession.If you want every little thing explained to you in detail at the end, Spiral may not be your movie, but the whole story makes perfect sense.  This is a film that could have ended very badly, but all of the painstaking detail and effort that went into the movie up until that point is more than aptly rewarded with a conclusion that I consider well-nigh perfect (and not necessarily predictable).  I was particularly impressed by the symbolism built into the presentation, as it quietly magnifies the significance of everything that happens, especially in the closing moments.  The film's jazz soundtrack helps maintain a surreal atmosphere that plays up the whole reality vs. fantasy angle that drives the story along (although it also reminded me just how much I detest light jazz).  And all of that stuff about the story progressing so slowly in the beginning - it's called pacing, and I think it's spot-on in this case.  The more you're able to wallow in the dysfunctional lives of these characters, the more effective the shock ending becomes.In case you can't tell, I love this movie.  I think it's a work of multi-faceted brilliance.",5,A brilliant film that delivers even more than it promises,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,3530,"[""'m"", 'used', 'liking', 'certain', 'films', 'seem', 'engender', 'only', 'lukewarm', 'response', 'majority', 'viewers', 'have', 'draw', 'line', 'sand', 'when', 'Spiral', 'brilliant', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'outr', 'eacute', 'work', 'cinematic', 'art', 'sound', 'own', 'uniquely', 'discordant', 'drum', 'pushing', 'pulling', 'viewer', 'ending', 'not', 'disappoint', 'slightest', 'will', 'grant', 'fact', 'film', 'moves', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'might', 'find', 'boring', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'whole', 'lives', 'immersed', 'crowd', 'might', 'look', 'down', 'noses', 'protagonist', 'even', 'making', 'effort', 'sympathize', 'let', 'alone', 'relate', 'very', 'human', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'wide', 'swath', 'emotional', 'landscape', 'be', 'pigeonholed', 'one', 'constraining', 'genre', 'Maybe', 'viewers', 'were', 'expecting', 'more', 'actual', 'horror', 'film', 'lines', 'Hatchet', 'Spiral', 'co-writer', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'co-director', 'Adam', 'Green', 'earlier', 'project', 'guys', 'are', 'obviously', 'true', 'filmmakers', 'devoted', 'craft', 'determined', 'spread', 'wings', 'rather', 'settle', 'churning', 'out', 'one', 'slasher', 'another.Spiral', 'story', 'Mason', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'troubled', 'fellow', 'who', 'so', 'far', 'mainstream', 'look', 'normal', 'popular', 'first', 'encounter', 'just', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'possibly', 'deranged', 'image', 'further', 'reinforced', 'mysterious', 'dark', 'secret', 'lurking', 'one', 'doors', 'apartment', 'frightening', 'visions', 'haunt', 'dreams', 'work', 'incapable', 'actually', 'associating', 'anyone', 'other', 'boss', 'long-time', 'friend', 'Berkeley', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'new', 'employee', 'named', 'Amber', 'Amber', 'Tamlyn', 'join', 'lonely', 'bench', 'lunch', 'up', 'friendship', 'Amber', 'hard', 'nut', 'crack', 'spontaneous', 'outwardly', 'emotional', 'not', 'mention', 'hot', 'very', 'opposite', 'Mason', 'yet', 'obviously', 'obvious', 'problems', 'awkward', 'friendship', 'slowly', 'more', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'when', 'posing', 'Mason', 'who', 'quite', 'artist', 'fact', 'art', 'be', 'one', 'safe', 'refuge', 'Mason', 'can', 'cling', 'life', 'actually', 'safe', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'word', 'sketches', 'paintings', 'reveal', 'troubling', 'portents', 'obsession.If', 'want', 'little', 'thing', 'explained', 'detail', 'end', 'Spiral', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'whole', 'story', 'perfect', 'sense', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'very', 'badly', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'effort', 'went', 'movie', 'up', 'point', 'more', 'aptly', 'rewarded', 'conclusion', 'consider', 'well-nigh', 'perfect', 'not', 'necessarily', 'predictable', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'symbolism', 'built', 'presentation', 'quietly', 'significance', 'everything', 'especially', 'closing', 'moments', 'film', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', 'maintain', 'surreal', 'atmosphere', 'up', 'whole', 'reality', 'vs.', 'fantasy', 'angle', 'story', 'also', 'reminded', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'detest', 'light', 'jazz', 'stuff', 'story', 'progressing', 'so', 'slowly', 'beginning', 'called', 'pacing', 'think', 'spot-on', 'case', 'more', ""'re"", 'able', 'wallow', 'dysfunctional', 'lives', 'characters', 'more', 'effective', 'shock', 'ending', 'becomes.In', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'love', 'movie', 'think', 'work', 'multi-faceted', 'brilliance']",Spiral

A commentary about misfits?  The unfolding of this story of socially inept Mason and the girl he hopes will ""be the one"" is slow and deliberate, with some scenes between them painfully awkward.  There are undercurrents of madness, obsession, and psychological torment, although these all have a vagueness that never sharpens into the horror suggested by the film's trailer.Despite the flaws, ""Spiral"" remains an interesting film.  Joel David Moore seems to get inside Mason's skin, although he overdoes Mason's tortured personality so it hardly seems believable that he hangs out with the people he does.  Amber Tamblyn is thoroughly likeable as . . . Amber, but the chemistry between her and Moore never quites succeeds.  The cinematography is adept, with its hues of orange and red, and the use of rain.The extras offer nothing special (except the trailer, which is interesting only because it splices all the tense moments into a minute that perhaps bests the film itself).This film is a decent way to spend an evening, but I don't recommend going out of your way to see it.",3,A Film With an Identity Crisis (3+ stars),1205884800,"03 19, 2008",2008,1198,"['Spiral', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'be', 'Horror', 'Psychological', 'thriller', 'relationship', 'film', 'commentary', 'misfits', 'unfolding', 'story', 'socially', 'inept', 'Mason', 'girl', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'scenes', 'painfully', 'awkward', 'are', 'undercurrents', 'madness', 'obsession', 'psychological', 'torment', 'have', 'vagueness', 'never', 'horror', 'suggested', 'film', 'flaws', 'Spiral', 'interesting', 'film', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'get', 'Mason', 'skin', 'Mason', 'tortured', 'personality', 'hardly', 'believable', 'out', 'people', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'thoroughly', 'likeable', 'Amber', 'chemistry', 'Moore', 'never', 'cinematography', 'adept', 'hues', 'orange', 'red', 'use', 'rain.The', 'extras', 'offer', 'nothing', 'special', 'trailer', 'interesting', 'only', 'tense', 'moments', 'minute', 'perhaps', 'film', '.This', 'film', 'decent', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'going', 'way', 'see']",Spiral

There is a corridor in his apartment which seems to be hiding a secret. It beckons to Mason at times but he avoids it. There are deep emotional scars hidden within Mason's mind which gradually become evident as he listens to jazz and engages in sketching. His mind wanders to either dreams or real events which haunt him. The story unfolds gradually, revealing details about Mason's lonely existence, as he washes his soiled hands of what could be blood or red paint. Despite Mason's peculiar quiet withdrawn behavior he is protected by his boss when Mason arrives late to work. Berkley, his boss, knows Mason's history. Berkley goes out of his way to include Mason in activties, such as shooting basketball and also a Christmas dinner. Berkley is a bit arrogant and a ladies man, a handsome macho guy who is secure in his job and of his ability to win over women.Mason packs a brown bag lunch daily and often eats it outside on a bench. There he meets a new employee Amber, who notices Mason's sketches of a pretty lady about which he is rather secretive. Mason is withdrawn but gradually befriends the vivacious and perky Amber who shows interest in him. She goes out of her way to sit with him at lunch and walk him home under her umbrella during a rainy day. She invents ways to meet him and eventually they date. She is invited to his bachelor's apartment and becomes a model for him to paint. Mason takes a bus ride to a cemetery where he visits the grave of his mother, where nearby, a young boy is attending a funeral but breaks away and goes behind a tree to cry ... alone ... the situation is very eery. Somehow it becomes symbolic of Mason's own life.As Amber continues sitting and posing for Mason, she becomes more and more emotionally involved and one day, they make love. She also becomes more curious about his love of jazz and the sketches he has done . He invites her to his apartment again. The viewer then discovers the sinister secrets which Mason has been hiding. This film is superbly done and totally involves the viewer in the convoluted mind and twisted feelings of Mason as the truth behind his quietness and hidden behavior is revealed. This is a most highly recommended film.

1124986,AHB0L35LOICAN,B0010AN7LS,"GB Banks (publisher, author) "", author""","[5, 7]","From the very beginning of the movie, two things are clear.First, this isn't some big-budget Hollywood thriller whose high-profile casting and slick production values are meant to lure you into believing the film is markedly better than it actually is.And secondly, despite being a low budget movie, that this is indeed a well made film that grabs your attention right away and promises to be a compelling tale. And for me personally, this movie pays off on its promises quite well.This is the story of Mason (portrayed brilliantly by co-writer and co-director Joel David Moore), a withdrawn and clearly disturbed man who has many problems, including severe asthma, and a past that seems to haunt his every day life. From the very first scene we're led to believe that he's done something terrible involving a woman whose portrait he has drawn or painted several times, and fills his apartment. Without going too deeply into the plot (which other reviews have already explored, I'm sure), suffice it to say that over time, Mason meets and begins to fall in love with a new woman, Amber Tamblyn, whom then becomes the new object of his obsession.What I like about this story is that it seems to intentionally avoid turning into one of the gory, slasher, blood-bath movies that seem to be all the rage these days. I think the comparisons with Hitchcocking horror are a bit stretched, but it's not completely irrelevant either. This is a psychological horror tale that explores the human frailties and the desperate need for acceptance that most of us face on some level each day. Both the lead character, Mason, and his new girlfriend Amber seem to both be looking for that special someone who will fill out the missing parts and make them whole. The fact that they find each other, and that for a while you really begin to hope and pray that this ends in the proverbial ""And They Lived Happily Ever After"" is a direct testament to the acting of Moore and Tamblyn.The movie's plot isn't the greatest, but frankly, it's a simple movie and a simple tale, and I think it's the perfect vehicle in which the actors themselves should be allowed to carry the movie, which they did to great effect. And given the fact that this is a horror movie and are fairly certain that a happy ending just isn't in the cards, it's hard to expect a film like this to have a new and innovative ending. And yet, I have to admit that the twist that ensues did in fact surprise me and left me feeling sad. The movie treats Mason as a flawed human being who is worthy of compassion, rather than the mindless monster of a man without a soul that populates most horror stories today, and I found that, and the lack of copious amounts of fake blood splattering the screen, to be quite refreshing.The movie is not perfect, but in my opinion nothing ever is anyway. But what it is is a very well done, straightforward, psychological horror of a man for who you expect the worst from, but find yourself hoping for the best for.

However, as I watched this movie as part of the Amazon Vine Program, I felt it behooved me to offer an honest review of it.This movie is really not worth the time or money you would spend to watch it.  The acting is passable if uninspired, with the protagonist being the best we get.  He does a fair job of portraying a disturbed artist, but the background of the character is so fragile and thin and arrives so late that it makes the story a failure.  The relationships are terribly developed, and would make the people in them suicidal should they exist in real life.  The total apathy and disregard the supporting cast feels towards the protagonist for most of the film is depressing.  I actually liked the character of the best friend, who displays some compassion as he describes why he is the main character's friend.The story purports to have a twist at the end, which is very poorly executed and not at all surprising, and would have been so either way it could have gone.  There is nothing in the cinematography that is remarkable, and the semi-focus on jazz music is incomplete when it could have been used as a real focus of the plot.

1124989,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0010AN7LS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","So this one tells of a strange, ill-fitting romance. It's also a claustrophobic psychological thriller, taking place in a dreary and drizzly Portland. Mason is the creepy, asthmatic insurance telemarketer who leads a lonely, solitary life. And, as per norm with tightly wound up, deeply disturbed recluses, he holds in some seriously pent up stuff. His art and his jazz collection are seemingly his only means of release and source of comfort. It's curious, though, that Mason is always sketching his subjects in the same poses (it makes you go, ""Hmmm...). His sole means to companionship lies in his mysoginist boss, Berkeley (Zachary Levi), with whom he shares an addled friendship. From the start, we're aware that Mason has been having recurring nightmares concerning a bathroom door and a girl who might or might not have been brutally murdered.But then his sunny and offbeat co-worker Amber (Amber Tamblyn) takes an interest in him. In Amber's effervescent presence Mason finally relaxes enough to let his guard down. But, maybe, just maybe, it would've been better if Mason had been left alone. Because this isn't a typical love story. As Mason becomes more comfortable in his own skin, this leaves the way open to something dark which has always skulked just beneath his neuroses.SPIRAL is one of those quietly unsettling films which you can't really sit thru without feeling squirmy. Even in the early stages, when the story is basically a character study, a sense of discomfort is fostered, brought about mostly by a focusing on Mason's off-kiltered and fairly effed-up private world. About two-thirds of SPIRAL is locked into the evolution of Mason and Amber's uneasy relationship, as well as tidbits here and there of Mason and Berkeley interacting. Gradually, the film takes on a noirish texture; a sense of ugliness and a horrific anticipation creep up as we learn potentially frightening things about our guy.I wasn't sure if the languid pace would be able to keep my eyeballs glued to the screen. But, it turns out, the film drops enough points of interest and jumpy moments to maintain my backpocket in a parked position. While I wasn't predisposed to liking Mason, I couldn't help but be fascinated by (and leery of) him, so I hung around to see what makes him tick.  Mason is a painful character to watch, confounded as he is by his inner demons. Joel David Moore plays Mason, and he not only takes on the lead role but also co-writes and co-directs this low-budgeted indie. Acting wise, Moore is solid, even if his character isn't so sympathetic (he's a bit too creepy for that). Yet you still feel a bit for the poor, awkward bastard.I picked up SPIRAL mostly because of Zachary Levi, who's simply tremendous in his nerdy leading man role in CHUCK. I'll tell you what, Levi's Berkeley is pretty far removed from his Chuck Bartowski. That's some decent acting range. I think what makes Berkeley an appealing character - despite his boorish, womanizing nature - is his constant loyalty to his social misfit of a buddy. Amber Tamblyn, who was so good in JOAN OF ARCADIA and so forgettable in THE GRUDGE 2, shows off her stuff as Mason's warm and bubbly friend and then girlfriend. Watch Amber subtly work in her expressions, as her character, in turns, becomes drawn to, perplexed by, and, finally, increasingly nervous of the new dude in her life. Amber's good. I still miss JOAN OF ARCADIA.An aside now: for fans of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, there's a miniscule sighting of Tricia Helfer. She's in several minutes of a Christmas dinner scene, looking good in a sexy red thing. But then she's gone.I like that not everything is spelled out. What's up with the postcards? Did the movie ever unveil the final page that Mason ripped out in his sketchbook? I don't recall seeing it. His troubled childhood is hinted at but never probed in detail. And what's the story behind Mason and Berkeley's longstanding but odd-duck friendship? Things to perhaps fleetingly ponder, post-viewing. There are two twists in the film's final segment, one of which is a revelation dropped by Berkeley. But, once the film was over, I couldn't help but re-evaluate Berkeley's assertion, and if it had any merit at all.Bonus features time. The disc has an easy-going audio commentary by the filmmakers, including Joel David Moore, Amber Tamblyn and Zachary Levi (they're a fun-loving bunch). There's also ""Spinning Spiral: The Making Of SPIRAL"" - a negligible if breezy seven minutes of on-camera tomfoolery by cast and crew. This segment doesn't really offer much insight into the film itself. Insignificantly, there are also promos and the trailer. Basically, if you liked the film, I recommend checking out the much relaxed audio commentary (where it's learned that SPIRAL started out as a short film).Three stars for this one. I mostly enjoyed it.

1124995,AORGKBNQZ83O8,B0010AN7LS,"MacGuffin ""MacGuffin""","[2, 4]","I chose this overwrought, self-congratulatory, pretentious mess of an indie because I opened my monthly Vine invitation 17 minutes after it was sent and there was nothing else left. I often state that nothing is better than anything--in this case, I really should have practiced what I preach.The improbable plot revolves around Mason--a disturbed, unattractive young asthmatic artsy type (writer-producer-director and un-Orson Welles David Joel Moore), who's so profoundly disturbed that it's inconceivable that he's allowed to live unattended, much less able to actually earn a living as a telemarketer. He somehow manages to attract Amber--a cute but irritating and pushy (""I hate spunk.""--Lou Grant) young woman (Amber Tamblyn...what exactly would you call the middle-of-the word equivalent of alliteration?); the story evolves (I use the term loosely) from there. The third principal, Mason's supervisor cum best friend, Berkeley (a rather WASPy moniker for co-producer Zachary Levi), is a womanizing lout who, in real life, would be jobless as the result of numerous sexual harassment suits.I can't think of one good thing that the movie itself has going for it. The characters are unappealing, unlikeable, and cartoonish. The cinematography left me scratching my head; one ""theme"" that was particularly ridiculous was that of the humble brown paper lunch bag. At one point, we're treated to a close-up of Mason's hands as he removes the various components of his brown-bagged lunch onto his lap; in other scenes, we're treated to long shots in which the inevitable bag is prominently emphasized in the foreground. No explanation for this is ever provided (this is probably a good thing).The dialogue is ridiculous, often utilizing ""key"" words uttered with great significance and portent, e.g., ""rules"" and ""contrast."" Other gems include:""Now I know why you like to paint. Because you relate to it.""""You didn't kill anyone--your dad did. And I wish he hadn't. But I've got problems of my own.""""None of them are real, bud."" ""HOW CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE?!""And no, they're no less idiotic heard in context. (In addition, the writers confuse ""psychopath"" with ""psychotic."")The original music is a joke (think horror themes on an organ). The characters are unappealing stereotypes drawn with too heavy a hand. The story is juvenile. However, someone put up the money for this film and it got made, so it gets points for that. But not many. (Hey, ""Lilies of the Field"" this ain't.)Anchor Bay pretty much always does a nice job with their releases and this one is no exception. The print (which looks okay) is anamorphic widescreen. There are no captions or subtitles (i.e., non-English speakers and the hearing-impaired have been spared).

1124996,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B0010AN7LS,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[13, 20]","SPIRAL is very much a vanity piece.  Two of its executive producers hold starring roles, and it is co-written and co-directed by its leading man, Joel David Moore (who was so much better inArt School Confidential).  There's one thing that can be said of vanity: it does provide unity of vision.Unfortunately, it does not also provide clarity, at least in any great amount.  SPIRAL tells the tale of a socially stunted painter who is so scrunched up within himself and his past, that he shows to the world very little other than a neurotic tendency to clap his teeth together.  Mason is our painter, a chin-less, spine-less, quivering Jell-O mold of a man who is at his ablest when in front of the canvas.  Mason does such a terrific job of portraying this mental defective, that you will probably find him as grating as a hangnail from frame number one.Irony of ironies, the two people who are most central to his life are equally mind-numbing.  His boss and best friend is the inexplicable Berkeley (Zachary Levi), a lascivious man-whore who hires employees based on cup size.  The girl Mason befriends at work, Amber (Amber Tamblyn), is the human equivalent of an over-carbonated Sprite.  Neither one of these people have any new or interesting things to say.  Both of them appear to have purchased their personalities wholesale.  And they contrast so grotesquely with Mason's facial-tic of a life, that it is only by a supreme amount of mental effort that one can imagine why they endure his presence at all, let alone seek him out.  The occasionally hints at the truth behind Mason's fun-house mirror of a life.  There's an ever-lit room down the hall of his apartment that he stares at, but (almost) never enters.  He has an enigmatic set of ""rules"" by which he sketches and paints.  And his love of jazz is so powerful, he can wax philosophic about the musical art at the drop of a hat.  ""Jazz isn't about accesibility. It's more difficult to relate to. It isn't friendly or clean.""  He talks about how jazz masters devote their lives to learning the rules, and when they get together, all they do is break those rules.  ""It's decadent and carnal, all at the same time.""Hearing these lines, it's easy to suspect that the movie is setting you up for some kind of revealing pay-off, a glimpse at the way Mason's personality operates, but I'll save you the trouble by letting you know that they're only ballast.  Mason has almost no personality at all.  He's missing it the way some people miss a useful organ, and these words about jazz, it turns out, are his glass eye, his wooden leg.  The writers want us to believe he's a sympathetic human being, they want this small bit of dialogue to convince us that there's a working heart there, but there's no follow-through.Instead, what you have is a great, steady mural of pure mood.  I'll grant that it's a finally molded mood, very patient, even probative in its way, and beautifully done.  The filming, the toning, the shades and hues: nice stuff.  This is perhaps why the movie is billed as being ""Hitchcockian,"" and in that vein, it fits the bill.  But Hitchcock also had some creative stories to tell, and creative characters to tell them with.  Atmosphere isn't enough.  Heck, with Hitchcock, half the time the atmosphere was in the dialogue, and in how it was said.  Here, it is in slow, lushly colored pans.  It is in artful cuts and framing.  It is, by no means, in the characters.Which is the really sad part, because even the story has a bit of juice to it.  Never mind that you can see (at least one of) the twists coming from forty minutes away.  Audiences have grown so accustomed to twists that they're hard to pull off anymore with any degree of subtlety.  What's really agonizing about the movie is how glibly the film tries to pass off key plot points as artful blanks.  Sometimes films leave key questions unanswered as a way of escalating tension or interest.  But this kind of move is a cop-out if there's nothing to back it up.  Mason's rules, the ""final pose"" (a truly sinister and Hitchcockian idea), the very creepy room in Mason's very creepy apartment...It's all window dressing, all of it, curtains framing an old brick wall. It's sad to see such talent, such attention to detail, when the big picture is nothing but a sloppy, cryptic mess. Others might appreciate the stylism and the well-dosed dreariness -- I did -- but don't expect anything with depth or meaning. Like Mason's canvases, this flick is flat, lifeless, and it goes nowhere.",2,Dye!  Dye!

""Spiral"" ultimately fails because the viewer does not get enough clues to discern the motivations of each character. For example, why is Berkeley friends with Mason? Why is Mason strange? Why is Amber attracted to Mason? Why does Mason repeat the same posing pictures with several women? Why do these women pose for Mason? In short, there are too many ""why's"" and not enough material to answer them. I won't pose any more ""why"" questions for fear of plot spoilers, but you get the idea.As unsatisfying as ""Spiral"" was it was ironic how well (and almost beatuiful) the the end scene between Mason and Berkeley was shot.

His only friend is his womanizing boss, Berkeley, who takes care of Mason in his own, somewhat domineering way. That is until Mason meets Amber (Amber Tamblyn), an adorable (though sometimes overly so) girl who works in the same building and is also in need of a friend. Through Amber's persistence, she and Mason soon become friends and more, but it's only a matter of time before Mason's dark issues must come to the forefront.Skillfully and deceptively marketed as some sort of terrifying slasher film through a very misleading trailer, ""Spiral"" is actually an extremely satisfying, even Hitchcockian suspense-romance, wonderfully played out with superb performances and great jazz music. It's not quite perfect. I would have liked a bit more information about the characters to be revealed, and I wasn't totally comfortable with the non-jazz music in the end, but I think that was more about the chosen piece itself.  Yet, it is well worth seeing and even owning. Just don't expect an outright horror film like the trailer, included as an extra, would have you believe. Other extras are a ""making of"" (it's really just random behind the scenes footage),  three brief Starz promotional looks at the making, and a great commentary with co-director Adam Green and stars Joel David Moore (who is also co-director and co-writer), Amber Tamblyn, and Zachary Levi, plus co-writer/producer Jeremy Boreing and director of photography Will Barrett.

It's a movie that seems to have a very simple surface story but reveals at the end to have been a much more complex story than you imagined. It twists once and then again at the end for a satisfying yet disturbing ending. At the end, you're left with questions that you think you might discover the answer to if you watched it just one more time. While the movie is full of foreshadowing in its conversations, colors, objects, and actions, you're not really sure of the significance of these items until the end. If you loved the reality shifts inFight Club (Widescreen Edition),Memento,The Machinist, orThe Jacket, you'll probably appreciate this movie as well.Spiral tells the story of Mason, a quiet, nerdy guy who has never been to the movies and who spends all his free time sketching, painting, and listening to old jazz. He has frequent panic attacks which are linked to memories from his past. He doesn't seem to have any friends except an old friend from high school that hires him as a telemarketer and who seems to be the only one who understands his panic attacks. However, this changes one day when an outgoing new telemarketer named Amber befriends him at lunch. Mason doesn't say much, but Amber persists. Eventually, she convinces Mason to paint her ... and Mason seems to become more and more normal until Amber stumbles upon something that alerts her to just how psychologically bothered Mason really is.To say more about the plot would be to ruin the movie. But I insist that this is not just a movie about life as a telemarketer or about how a quiet guy is brought out of his shell by a girl. It's a disturbing story about letting ourselves believe what we want to believe. It's a story of illusions.

Mason's only real friend is his boss (Zachary Levi), until he is befriended by a slightly off-kilter woman (Amber Tamblyn (whose father Russ also has a cameo in the film) who shares his loneliness. The film is slow-paced, which might drive some people away but will only draw others in further. There are also loose ends which go unresolved (what is up with Mason's parents, for example?). The cinematography is impressive as well as the dreary, rainy locale jazz-inspired score, which gives this modern movie a film noir feel. ""Spiral"" is also slightly reminiscent of the disturbed loner films of Roman Polanski (""Tenant"" for example); while not ever rising to that level of cinematic art, it does portray the lead character in a similar way, where fantasy and reality intersect and overlap, leaving the viewer to guess which one is which. There are several twists in the film, which may or may not be surprising to the careful viewer.

After Amber entered his life he seemed to improve, though I had trouble understanding why she sought him out and wanted to be with him.

A competent screenplay with sufficient dead end teases and insteresting character development is brought to life by the also excellent cast.  Amber Tamblyn of the sadly eviscerated JOAN OF ARCADIA is spunky and seductive and easy to watch, while Zachary Levi shows range beyond his stammering computer nerd from CHUCK.  These two performances counter well off of DAVID JOEL MOORE'S slightly askew and misunderstood lead character Mason, and while his performance might have a few too many quirks the film itself does not.  This is an effective and straightforward thriller that delivers on an emotional and intellectual level, something that really can't be said of alot of startup indie horror and thriller material.  The soggy Portland is perfect setting for this tale of yearning and identity and the audio portion of the film (SANS THE CHEESY POP SONG FROM SONY) is incredibly effective at placing you in the leads headspace without resorting to alot of camera tricks and artistry that would have yielded the same effect.

Without giving any details to reveal the plot, the movie captured me from the very beginning, there are some disturbing sequences that do not reveal anything but have you wanting to know or guess what the main character's past is.

Sure the first reviewers were stunned, but we knew immediately that either A) Willis was dead B) the kid was dead or C) they both were. Then it was only an exercise in seeing how well it was done. Conversely, none of us quite figured out the twist of ""The Usual Suspects"" if only because it was so arbitrary. While ""Spiral"" is nowhere near as good as the two films above, it is well made, has some very clever (and not unfunny) dialogue and a twist that, while not on a par with ""Sixth Sense"" is certainly more earned than ""Suspects"". PLUS it has Amber Tamblyn and that means it is worth seeing. And it has a pre-Chuck Zachary Levi who's always interesting.

Her latest step into obscurity is with another straight to DVD outing, the psychological thriller Spriral where she plays the most interesting character.  Although Zach Levi gives her a run for her money, even though with the short hair and beard looks more like Jesse Metcalf than Chuck Bartowski.But the movie belongs to Joel David Moore (Hatchet) in every sense of the word as besides being the main character he also co-directed and co-wrote the movie.  So when he is what brings down the movie, you only have him to blame because whether you blame him, how it was written, or directed, in the end it all fall on him.Moore plays you token introvert working as a telemarketer under the eyes of Levi who has looked after him since high school and has been his only friend throughout that time.

1125014,A1SBVY5DX5ZKUX,B0010AN7LS,"S. Harrison ""Soulsista 1""","[3, 4]","This is the basis for this psychological thriller. Mason is an enigma, as so adeptly stated by Amber, a ""co-worker"" that befriends him one day at lunch. The movie starts and it has you wondering what terrible deed has Mason done?...and why? Immediately he reaches out to his boss, of all people, for comfort and support. We soon discover that his boss Berkley, is also a dear friend from high school.  Berkley apparently knows Mason and knows what happened to him in the past. He obviously feels that its his duty to protect Mason, keep him employed and defend him when necessary.Mason is a painter and he has many paintings of one woman in different poses all over his loft. Whatever is troubling him about these paintings ceases temporarily after he throughs them all away. As unstable as he may be, Mason let's his guard down when Amber warms up to him. He is a man of few words but shockingly, more than  way through the movie, he speaks passionately about the one topic of interest he has as much as sketching...Jazz.  He is very opinionated about Jazz stating ""only the finest artists can master it"".  Can this be a reference to himself as an artist too?Amber is witty and spontaneous, almost the total opposite of Mason.  But as soon as their relationship starts so does it end. What did Mason do to Amber? Is he so lost in the world since the death of his mother that he can no longer determine what are memories and what is imagination?Spiral had somewhat of the same premise as He Was A Quiet Man starring Christian Slater; the same office worker, loner guy who's about to lose it any minute. The movie did not succeed in its attempt to be a Hitchcock-like tail.

Joel David Moore is quite good playing Mason and he makes this awkward artist with obvious problems sympathetic and believable. Zachary Levi plays Berkeley, Mason's self-confident boss at a telemarketing office who inexplicably protects Mason both in the workplace and life.  And sweet faced Amber Tamblyn is Mason's ""dream girl"" conveniently also named Amber.  Two major elements in the premise of the story strain credibility.  Though we are told Berkely and Mason are lifelong friends and the script more than hints at Mason's tragic family past there is nothing we are shown in Berkely's ambitious selfish personality that really explains why he is such a loyal, protective friend to Mason.  The other unbelievable element concerns Mason's relationship with  Amber.  Though Amber is portrayed as a bit quirky herself she seems too attractive and articulate to be the initiator in a romantic relationship with troubled Mason.Two twists are revealed in the last twenty minutes or so of the movie. One of the twists  surprised me and the other did not.  The storyline is coherent and the filmmakers are wise in leaving a few unanswered questions for the viewer to think about instead of over explaining everything.  The well realized setting of Portland, Oregon in early winter is a bit different and adds realism and interest to the film as does the original jazz music that makes up most of the soundtrack.

1125018,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B0010AN7LS,TheBandit,"[1, 1]","I found myself quite engrossed in this movie.  In a way I was surprised, having expected a more typical horror flick.  Instead, ""Spiral"" is a very effective blend of brooding drama and slow-building suspense.The basic storyline concerns an athsmatic 30ish call center drone named Mason (Joel David Moore). He is socially awkward and obviously psychologically troubled in some way.  Early on, we see Mason making what apparently is a fairly regular middle-of-the-night phone call to his boss Berkeley (Zachary Levi), having awoken suddenly from a nightmare. Berkeley is a patient employer who has an interesting friendship (of sorts) with Mason. Through their conversations we learn bits and pieces about Mason's past.What seems to keep him going are his twin passions: painting and jazz music.  He is an active participant in the former, and a devout fan of the latter. He began his painting hobby by recreating classic jazz album covers, and now seems to exclusively concentrate on the female form. He has many notebooks of sketches, each one labelled with a different female name.Mason's worldview seems to improve slowly upon meeting a young woman named Amber (Amber Tamblyn).  The two develop a friendship that starts with stilted lunch-break conversation, blossoming over time to something much deeper.  Amber finds Mason intriguing - she responds to his 'tortured artist' vibe.  Mason responds to her openmindedness (and attractiveness).  She quickly becomes the subject of his latest series of paintings. Giving away more would be dirty pool. Suffice it to say, Mason's mental instability becomes a serious detriment to his new relationship.The acting by the principles is very good.  Joel David Moore manages to infuse Mason with just enough humanity to keep him sympathetic.  Amber Tamblyn is extremely likeable as Amber.  Zachery Levi gives Berkeley an unusual mix of corporate jerk (when he's at work) and nuturing big brother (in his scenes with Mason).Whether or not you'll see where this is all heading probably depends, in part, on how many movies you've seen.  I am usually horrible at figuring out how suspense movies will end, so it should be taken with a grain of salt that I managed to have a pretty good idea prior to the credits rolling.  That shouldn't be a deterrent, however, from checking out this movie.

I was pleasantly surprised, then, when ""Spiral"" turned out to be as restrained and modest as ""Hatchet"" was unfocused and over-broad. Director/Star Joel David Moore has wheezy neurosis down as call center lackey Mason, an artist with deep Mommy issues.His supervisor, NBC's ""Chuck"" Zachary Levi, plays his mismatched friend Berkeley. He is as outgoing and good with the ladies as Mason is inept. Some sort of backstory gets hinted at (especially during a brief appearance byBattlestar Galactica'sTricia Helfer) that insinuates something darker. When new employee Amber (Amber Tamblyn) seems to connect her missing pieces with Mason's broken personality, eventually - and this is a movie that builds very slowly - she finds herself in Mason's loft for a variety of sittings.But what is Mason drawing? A missing final sketch and a stash of sketch pads that show Mason's past relationships tips the movie into its final act. While it is obvious that something bad was eventually going to happen, ""Spiral's"" outcome arrives with workmanlike accuracy and a twist that satisfies if you're not expecting anything brilliant. The psuedo-Fight Clubmoment between Mason and Berkeley offers a tease...and yet Mason's fall is never quite explained. It is one of the things that you'll either love or hate this DVD over. What ""Spiral"" does offer in the plus category is plenty of interesting and inspired touches (like the mysterious final page in the skecthbooks, the cool soundtrack, a touching scene in front of a movie theater, etc) to lift this to slightly better than average.3.5 stars.",4,Spiraling out,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,1711,"['Having', 'seen', 'most', 'principals', 'here', 'over-the-top', 'horrorfestHatchet', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'Spiral', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'then', 'when', 'Spiral', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'restrained', 'modest', 'Hatchet', 'was', 'unfocused', 'over-broad', 'Director/Star', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'wheezy', 'neurosis', 'down', 'call', 'center', 'lackey', 'Mason', 'artist', 'deep', 'Mommy', 'issues.His', 'supervisor', 'NBC', 'Chuck', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'mismatched', 'friend', 'Berkeley', 'outgoing', 'good', 'ladies', 'Mason', 'inept', 'sort', 'backstory', 'hinted', 'especially', 'brief', 'appearance', 'byBattlestar', ""Galactica'sTricia"", 'Helfer', 'something', 'darker', 'When', 'new', 'employee', 'Amber', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'connect', 'missing', 'pieces', 'Mason', 'broken', 'personality', 'eventually', 'movie', 'very', 'slowly', 'Mason', 'loft', 'variety', 'sittings.But', 'what', 'Mason', 'drawing', 'missing', 'final', 'sketch', 'stash', 'sketch', 'pads', 'show', 'Mason', 'past', 'relationships', 'movie', 'final', 'act', 'obvious', 'something', 'bad', 'was', 'eventually', 'going', 'happen', 'Spiral', 'outcome', 'workmanlike', 'accuracy', 'twist', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'anything', 'brilliant', 'psuedo-Fight', 'Clubmoment', 'Mason', 'Berkeley', 'tease', 'yet', 'Mason', 'fall', 'never', 'quite', 'explained', 'one', 'things', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'DVD', 'What', 'Spiral', 'offer', 'plus', 'category', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'inspired', 'touches', 'mysterious', 'final', 'page', 'skecthbooks', 'cool', 'soundtrack', 'touching', 'scene', 'front', 'movie', 'theater', 'etc', 'lift', 'slightly', 'better', 'average.3.5', 'stars']",Spiral

Joel David Moore (Avatar) co-wrote, co-directed, co-produced, and stars in the film as Mason, a shy loner who is befriended by young woman, who is taken by his talents as an artist.  Adam Green (Frozen,Hatchet (Unrated Director's Cut)) serves as co-director for this rather engaging, though somewhat predictable tale.Working at an insurance company as a telemarketer, Mason is a guy who seems to have some psychological issues.  His boss Berkley (Zachary Levi from TV's Chuck) is also his friend, and is rather free with giving Mason personal advice.  Mason is an artist, and his sketches draw the attention of Amber (Amber Tamblyn), a new employee at the company.  Vivacious, and perhaps a little whimsical, Amber takes the initiative and begins to draw Mason out of his shell, discovering that he is also a jazz aficionado.  The two form an odd, but sweet kind of relationship, as Amber eventually convinces Mason to paint her portrait.  Pleased with the results, Amber poses for additional paintings.  Just when they have become close, a dagger of suspicion changes everything.Mason seems to become more human as the story progresses, and it is possible at times to envision he and Amber as players in some flighty romantic comedy, almost up until the final dark turn.  With strong performances by Joel David Moore and Amber Tamblyn (Joan of Arcadia), Spiral is a film best viewed with a minimum of foreknowledge.  It's mostly an interesting and compelling watch, albeit one with a number of really large plot holes.

Something I admittedly have difficulty with in movies is characters depicted as friends who I can't even imagining wanting to be NEAR each other. Yeah, codependent friendships do exist but who in the heck wants to watch someone put up with this miserable nonsense from his clearly disturbed friend? No amount of superiority complex this might feed would seem to warrant this. Has anyone involved in this ever actually been in, let alone worked in a telemarketing office atmosphere? Obviously, shooting in one doesn't guarantee soaking up a realistic vibe. Every character seems to exist to &#34;propel&#34; the non-plot forward. We're talking extremely unbelievable behavior and naivete. It's just a mess. Just because it's &#34;low-fi&#34; and &#34;indie&#34; it doesn't change an unpleasant mess from being an unpleasant mess. It's clumsy and it tries to be edgy and arty. Yuck. I enjoy a well-told grim film dealing with a character's tenuous grasp of sanity and reality. However, this time, I had to shut it off and go wash the &#34;yuck&#34; from my brain. No thanks. I mean- a character who values his sketches walks around in the pouring rain with his sketchbook in hand?
