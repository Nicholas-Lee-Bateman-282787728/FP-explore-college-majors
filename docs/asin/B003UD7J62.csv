1363549,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B003UD7J62,barry,"[1, 1]","HAPPY ENDINGS is a delight - it is innovative, witty, intelligent and most importantly hilarious.  Many automatically compare it to FRIENDS for there are 6 main characters - 3 men and 3 women, but that is where all comparisons end.  This show is in no way a copy cat to any other show that has aired.  I fell in love with it when the 13 episodes of the first season aired and the awesome thing about getting the dvd is that the show when aired on network tv was not shown with the episodes in the order intended.  There is a basic plot here.  In the pilot Alex (Elisha Cuthbert) walks out during the wedding ceremony on her fince Dave (Zachary Knighton)  and the following episodes follow how they and their mutual friends deal with the fall-out of this.  Seeing them in order gives more depth to the characters and the story lines.The show manages to shine in every way, each character is in no way a caricature and each actor is perfect in their given role.  Elisha Cuthbert comes from a serious role on 24 and shines.  My favorites though are Casey Wilson from SNL who plays Penny and Damon Wayans Jr. who plays Brad.  I was very upset when SNL just up and let go of Casey Wilson but it was truly their loss as she shines in a role that gives her a much better field of play than the now tired SNL.  Episodes are filled with heart and also honest insight into the characters.  And the writers deserve as much credit as the actors for each episode is filled with laughs and many that turn into full out belly laughs.  I highly recommend purchasing this wonderful first season of this great show.  And if you haven't given it a shot yet catch up with the second season that is airing now.  This is a show that just continues to get better and better.  It is fresh, witty and deserves a truly wide audience.  Give it a chance and I guarantee it will pull you in fully.",5,One of the best comedies on tv,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,1868,"['HAPPY', 'ENDINGS', 'delight', 'innovative', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'most', 'importantly', 'hilarious', 'Many', 'automatically', 'compare', 'FRIENDS', 'are', '6', 'main', 'characters', '3', 'men', '3', 'women', 'where', 'comparisons', 'end', 'show', 'way', 'copy', 'cat', 'other', 'show', 'aired', 'fell', 'love', 'when', '13', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'aired', 'awesome', 'thing', 'getting', 'dvd', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'network', 'tv', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'episodes', 'order', 'intended', 'basic', 'plot', 'here', 'pilot', 'Alex', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'out', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'fince', 'Dave', 'Zachary', 'Knighton', 'following', 'episodes', 'follow', 'how', 'mutual', 'friends', 'deal', 'fall-out', 'Seeing', 'order', 'more', 'depth', 'characters', 'story', 'lines.The', 'show', 'shine', 'way', 'character', 'way', 'caricature', 'actor', 'perfect', 'given', 'role', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'serious', 'role', '24', 'shines', 'favorites', 'are', 'Casey', 'Wilson', 'SNL', 'who', 'Penny', 'Damon', 'Wayans', 'Jr.', 'who', 'Brad', 'was', 'very', 'upset', 'when', 'SNL', 'just', 'up', 'let', 'go', 'Casey', 'Wilson', 'was', 'truly', 'loss', 'role', 'much', 'better', 'field', 'play', 'now', 'tired', 'SNL', 'Episodes', 'are', 'filled', 'heart', 'also', 'honest', 'insight', 'characters', 'writers', 'deserve', 'much', 'credit', 'actors', 'episode', 'filled', 'laughs', 'many', 'turn', 'full', 'out', 'belly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'wonderful', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'shot', 'yet', 'catch', 'up', 'second', 'season', 'airing', 'now', 'show', 'just', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'fresh', 'witty', 'truly', 'wide', 'audience', 'Give', 'chance', 'guarantee', 'will', 'pull', 'fully']",Happy Endings: Season 1

Picture quality is good for DVD, with seven episodes on each DVD.Audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The series is dialogue-driven and dialogue is clear and understandable.  Music is heard through the surround channels but this is primarily a center and front channel-driven soundtrack.Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Happy Endings: The Complete First Season"" includes the following special features:DISC 1:Banana Republic Style Preview: The Girls of Happy Endings - (2:19) Karen Smith (costume designer) talks about the look for the women of the show.Banana Republic Style Preview: The Guys of Happy Endings - (2:10) Karen Smith (costume designer) talks about the look for the men of the show.Deleted Scenes - (6:39) A total of seven deleted scenes.Outtakes - (4:13) Featuring outtakes from ""Happy Endings"" season one.DISC 2:Mike Relm Remix - (1:27) A music video remix from various scenes from the series.Mark Douglas Interview with Adam Pally and Casey Wilson - (5:03) Mark plans to do an interview with Adam Pally (Max) and Casey Wilson (Penny) while Mike Relm continues to do his remixes during the interview.Mark Douglas Parody Theme Song - (1:15) Mark Douglas sings his ""Happy Ending"" theme song.Deleted Scenes - (4:57) Six deleted scenes.EXTRAS:""Happy Endings: The Complete First Season"" comes with a slip cover case.JUDGMENT CALL:""Happy Endings"" is a series that has won me over!When the comedy series ""Scrubs"" ended its final season, the one thing I would miss is its insane humor and the writers willing to take on comedy and trying to push the envelope of what can be accomplished on national television.We have seen that kind of insanity and craziness on television with ""Cougar Town"" (created by ""Scrubs"" creator Bill Lawrence) and Dan Harmon with his comedy series ""Community"" and now we see it with David Caspe's ""Happy Endings"".It took a few episodes for the cast to gel, but from the third episode on, things seemed natural and fun and if anything, its a series that has a crazy perspective towards relationships courtesy of its crazy characters and by watching the series and seeing the outtakes, it looks as if the talent can really improvise a bit and have fun with their character's own personal hijinks.Personally, I'm not sure how much is scripted and how much is improvised but I will say that, whatever the writers are doing...I'm really enjoying the series!It's great to see actress Elisha Cuthbert move away from the more dramatic role that she was known for in ""24' and play an ex-girlfriend Alex who is unsure about her friendship, relationship or whatever you want to call it with Dave (played by Zachary Knighton).It's also great to see ""Scrubs"" actress Eliza Coupe return in another crazy role as the perfectionist Jane Williams, sister of Alex but then you have the three odd friends.Casey Wilson as Penny Hartz who is like the 30-something friend who tries too hard to find a man, Adam Pally as the gay friend Max Blum who has an opinion for everything and Damon Wayans Jr. as Brad Williams who is the supportive friend who somehow gets stuck in doing things that he doesn't want to do.The series is so crazy, for example in the episode ""Mein Coming Out"", Max's parents are coming to visit and he hasn't told them he is gay.  So, Jane tries to pretend she is his girlfriend and keeps french kissing him, despite being married to Brad.  As for Penny, she is Jewish but is in love with a guy who has the last name Hitler.  And as for Max's parents, they think that Dave is gay.  And what you get is a crazy episode where all things go wrong.  But it's so hilarious to watch!This is just one example but there are 12-episodes just as crazy and anyone who is looking for a series about relationships, marriage and wacky friendships should really give ""Happy Endings"" a try.  Unlike ""Scrubs"" which took place in a hospital, ""Community"" which takes place in a community college and ""Cougar Town"" which takes place in the homes of neighbors, ""Happy Endings"" brings characters out to a variety of locations and the writers have fun with it.It's an infectious comedy series!As for the DVD, you get 13-episodes and a good number of short special features.  The outtakes were hilarious and it would be nice for season two if there are audio commentary tracks added, especially with the cast.  That would be fun to listen to!While I feel it is still to early to know if this series has what it takes to last for multiple seasons, I did enjoy this first season and I can't wait for the second.  I love in which the characters are just crazy but I do love the setting of featuring a group of friends that are all different.  You have an interracial couple, a gay character, a couple who have a failed relationship and a neurotic Jewish woman...and somehow, the writers made these characters work well with each other and the talent, their chemistry is just right.Overall, ""Happy Endings: The Complete First Season"" is a series for those who want to laugh and are open to humor similar to a series such as ""Scrubs"" and just want all out craziness.  I look forward in seeing where the writers take these characters for season two.Recommended!",4,"(3.5 stars) ""Happy Endings"" is a series that has won me over!",1335571200,"04 28,

The thing is that there are more good TV series coming out these days than I've seen in some time. Which is odd since most people complain about how bad TV is these days. Those people need to watch a little more and DVD gives them the chance to do so. Take the new series HAPPY ENDINGS for example.The series opens with the set up, a wedding for characters Dave (Zachary Knighton) and Alex (Elisha Cuthbert). As their vows are being exchanged, a rollerblading guy rolls in and tells Alex she can't go through with it, to come with him. She agrees and off they roll. What follows is a group of people that are friends of both individuals who must learn how to deal with staying friends with them while not alienating either.So that's the set up. The thing is as each episode unfolds we get to see how their attempts fail and how Alex and Dave develop into friends as opposed to man and wife. All the while there's an undercurrent that perhaps these two are destined to be together and that maybe one day they'll realize that. Until then everyone walks on eggshells trying not to take one side or the other.There are two things that make this show stick out from so many other comedies on these days. The first is the writing. The stories offer ways to move the idea of the friends dealing with issues that are brought into focus by the couples parting ways, by their friendship and eventually in how they deal with one another. The wordplay is witty and fast paced so much so that on occasion you need to back up to catch a line because you were laughing so hard. In jokes are also on hand, like referencing Cuthbert's role as Jack Bauer's daughter on the series ""24"" when one character says she acts like her.The second thing that makes this series work is the character and the casting. Each actor portrays their role to perfection. Knighton as Dave seems like the loveable guy who was left at the alter only to move on to find his dream. Cuthbert is great as the runaway bride who followed an impulse only to realize later how it affected everyone else.Rounding out the friends are interracial couple Jane and Brad Williams (Eliza Coupe and Damon Wayans, Jr.). Brad is an executive while Jane is Alex's sister, a competitive woman with a touch of OCD. Casey Williams stars as Penny Hart, the 30 year old single woman still searching for Mr. Right and nearly ready to accept anyone. Rounding out the group is Adam Pally as Max Blum, the not so obviously gay man who Dave ends up sharing an apartment with after the break up.One of the greatest things about these characters is that while each could become an issue to press be it race or sexual preference, they instead are just all good friends. They support one another, they help one another and they seem like everyday folks rather than a rallying cry for some cause or another. When treated like just characters rather than symbols it becomes much easier to accept them as they should be accepted.Episodes deal with so many issues that develop from the main set up as well as the characters. Everything including coming out to your parents, sleepwalking, opening up to your parent that you love them and my favorite who of two characters would survive in a zombie apocalypse. Yes indeed, Jane and Max compete with one another to decide who would be the one to carry on. Remember I said this was a comedy?While watching this series I had to stop it occasionally until I could stop laughing. It was one of those DVDs that you begin watching and find yourself not wanting to turn off, instead looking at the clock and saying well I can sleep tomorrow night, I'll just watch one more episode. It's amazing how fast those half hour episodes fly by.By the end of this collection you'll find yourself wanting more and you'll realize that this is a show you can watch the old ones of and still find yourself laughing. Yes, as with most comedies these days, there are the occasional risqu&eacute; jokes, but nothing that was too blatant. All in all, while perhaps not a family comedy, this is one series that will make you laugh and be worth adding to your collection.",4,IT'S GREAT TO LAUGH,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4196,"['most', 'what', ""'m"", 'writing', 'days', 'up', 'being', 'TV', 'series', 'thing', 'are', 'more', 'good', 'TV', 'series', 'coming', 'days', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'Which', 'odd', 'most', 'people', 'complain', 'how', 'bad', 'TV', 'days', 'people', 'need', 'watch', 'little', 'more', 'DVD', 'chance', 'do', 'so', 'Take', 'new', 'series', 'HAPPY', 'ENDINGS', 'example.The', 'series', 'set', 'up', 'wedding', 'characters', 'Dave', 'Zachary', 'Knighton', 'Alex', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'vows', 'are', 'being', 'exchanged', 'rollerblading', 'guy', 'rolls', 'tells', 'Alex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'come', 'roll', 'What', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'friends', 'individuals', 'who', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'deal', 'staying', 'friends', 'not', 'alienating', 'either.So', 'set', 'up', 'thing', 'episode', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'attempts', 'fail', 'how', 'Alex', 'Dave', 'develop', 'friends', 'opposed', 'man', 'wife', 'undercurrent', 'perhaps', 'two', 'are', 'destined', 'be', 'together', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'then', 'everyone', 'walks', 'eggshells', 'trying', 'not', 'take', 'one', 'side', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'make', 'show', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'comedies', 'days', 'first', 'writing', 'stories', 'offer', 'ways', 'move', 'idea', 'friends', 'dealing', 'issues', 'are', 'brought', 'focus', 'couples', 'parting', 'ways', 'friendship', 'eventually', 'how', 'deal', 'one', 'wordplay', 'witty', 'fast', 'paced', 'so', 'much', 'occasion', 'need', 'back', 'up', 'catch', 'line', 'were', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'jokes', 'are', 'also', 'hand', 'referencing', 'Cuthbert', 'role', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'daughter', 'series', '24', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'her.The', 'second', 'thing', 'series', 'work', 'character', 'casting', 'actor', 'role', 'perfection', 'Knighton', 'Dave', 'loveable', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'alter', 'only', 'move', 'find', 'dream', 'Cuthbert', 'great', 'runaway', 'bride', 'who', 'followed', 'impulse', 'only', 'realize', 'later', 'how', 'affected', 'everyone', 'else.Rounding', 'out', 'friends', 'are', 'interracial', 'couple', 'Jane', 'Brad', 'Williams', 'Eliza', 'Coupe', 'Damon', 'Wayans', 'Jr.', 'Brad', 'executive', 'Jane', 'Alex', 'sister', 'competitive', 'woman', 'touch', 'OCD', 'Casey', 'Williams', 'Penny', 'Hart', '30', 'year', 'old', 'single', 'woman', 'still', 'searching', 'Mr', 'Right', 'nearly', 'ready', 'accept', 'anyone', 'Rounding', 'out', 'group', 'Adam', 'Pally', 'Max', 'Blum', 'not', 'so', 'obviously', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'Dave', 'up', 'sharing', 'apartment', 'break', 'up.One', 'greatest', 'things', 'characters', 'could', 'become', 'issue', 'press', 'be', 'race', 'sexual', 'preference', 'instead', 'are', 'just', 'all', 'good', 'friends', 'support', 'one', 'help', 'one', 'seem', 'everyday', 'folks', 'rather', 'rallying', 'cry', 'cause', 'When', 'treated', 'just', 'characters', 'rather', 'symbols', 'becomes', 'much', 'easier', 'accept', 'should', 'be', 'accepted.Episodes', 'deal', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'develop', 'main', 'set', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'Everything', 'including', 'coming', 'out', 'parents', 'sleepwalking', 'opening', 'up', 'parent', 'love', 'favorite', 'who', 'two', 'characters', 'would', 'survive', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'Yes', 'indeed', 'Jane', 'Max', 'compete', 'one', 'decide', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'carry', 'Remember', 'said', 'was', 'comedy', 'watching', 'series', 'had', 'stop', 'occasionally', 'could', 'stop', 'laughing', 'was', 'one', 'DVDs', 'begin', 'watching', 'find', 'not', 'wanting', 'turn', 'off', 'instead', 'looking', 'clock', 'saying', 'well', 'can', 'sleep', 'tomorrow', 'night', ""'ll"", 'just', 'watch', 'one', 'more', 'episode', 'amazing', 'how', 'fast', 'half', 'hour', 'episodes', 'fly', 'end', 'collection', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wanting', 'more', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'old', 'ones', 'still', 'find', 'laughing', 'Yes', 'most', 'comedies', 'days', 'are', 'occasional', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'jokes', 'nothing', 'was', 'too', 'blatant', 'perhaps', 'not', 'family', 'comedy', 'one', 'series', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'be', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection']",Happy Endings: Season 1

Should have figured it out sooner when Damon Wayans actually plays Damon Wayans Jr. father.  That episode was definitely hilarious.

A year has passed, we're still unhappy with that decision. However, we still watch the reruns on VH1, and still find time to laugh.
