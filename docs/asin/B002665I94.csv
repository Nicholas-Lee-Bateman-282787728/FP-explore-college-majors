1250972,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002665I94,B. E Jackson,"[2, 8]","Teenage Dirtbag isn't a particularly good film.  The storytelling seriously doesn't contain much in the way of excitement the entire time.  It's a VERY slow-moving storyline from start to finish.It's about a teenage cheerleader who forms a relationship with a troubled teenage boy at school.  The way the relationship develops is really strange, and that in itself had potential (because it was different, at least) but because of the slow-moving nature of the entire film, any development here felt more like a chore to pay attention to instead of containing any kind of interesting storyline progression.The boy tries to win over the cheerleader by eating and drinking really strange things as a way to show off I guess, but the girl isn't impressed by *any* of this in the least.  Instead she's grossed out (as she should be).  Eventually during a study hall class, the boy begins hitting off a relationship with the girl by passing her notes and asking questions in the notebook, and she responds to them (which prompts a constant back and forth notebook-passing game during study hall).It turns out the boy comes from an abusive family.  We see some interesting scenes involving the boy and his father getting into a few fights.  Even though it appears like the cheerleader was aware of this (because the boy even shows her the marks on his side where his father had been hitting him) she didn't seem to care or feel any kind of concern or worry whatsoever.  This felt like awkward writing to me because the girl most definitely SHOULD have cared about him by this point.Now what would've been interesting had been if the cheerleader turned out to have a rocky relationship with her parents as well.  One scene shows the cheerleader being told to go tie a rope correctly (concerning a boat near a dock) and this scene was immediately shown after we find out the boy is being abused by his family.  Would have been a significant storyline improvement had BOTH the cheerleader and the boy fallen in love with each other with both of them having to deal with abusive parents.Anyway, the writing severely hurt what potentially could have been an above average storyline.  As it stands, it's just a decent film.",3,passable storytelling,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,2211,"['Teenage', 'Dirtbag', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'film', 'storytelling', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'contain', 'much', 'way', 'excitement', 'entire', 'time', 'VERY', 'slow-moving', 'storyline', 'start', 'finish.It', 'teenage', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'relationship', 'troubled', 'teenage', 'boy', 'school', 'way', 'relationship', 'really', 'strange', 'had', 'potential', 'was', 'different', 'least', 'slow-moving', 'nature', 'entire', 'film', 'development', 'here', 'felt', 'more', 'chore', 'pay', 'attention', 'instead', 'containing', 'kind', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'progression.The', 'boy', 'tries', 'win', 'cheerleader', 'eating', 'drinking', 'really', 'strange', 'things', 'way', 'show', 'off', 'guess', 'girl', ""n't"", 'impressed', '*any*', 'least', 'Instead', 'grossed', 'out', 'should', 'be', 'Eventually', 'study', 'hall', 'class', 'boy', 'hitting', 'off', 'relationship', 'girl', 'passing', 'notes', 'asking', 'questions', 'notebook', 'constant', 'back', 'forth', 'notebook-passing', 'game', 'study', 'hall', '.It', 'out', 'boy', 'abusive', 'family', 'see', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'involving', 'boy', 'father', 'getting', 'few', 'fights', 'Even', 'cheerleader', 'was', 'aware', 'boy', 'even', 'marks', 'side', 'where', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'hitting', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'feel', 'kind', 'concern', 'worry', 'whatsoever', 'felt', 'like', 'awkward', 'writing', 'girl', 'most', 'definitely', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'cared', 'point.Now', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'interesting', 'had', 'been', 'cheerleader', 'turned', 'out', 'have', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'parents', 'well', 'One', 'scene', 'cheerleader', 'being', 'told', 'go', 'tie', 'rope', 'correctly', 'concerning', 'boat', 'dock', 'scene', 'was', 'immediately', 'shown', 'find', 'out', 'boy', 'being', 'abused', 'family', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'significant', 'storyline', 'improvement', 'had', 'BOTH', 'cheerleader', 'boy', 'fallen', 'love', 'other', 'having', 'deal', 'abusive', 'parents.Anyway', 'writing', 'severely', 'hurt', 'what', 'potentially', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'above', 'average', 'storyline', 'just', 'decent', 'film']",Teenage Dirtbag
1250973,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002665I94,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[9, 12]","For the Scott Michael Foster fans, you will absolutely adore this film. I think there is a group of fans that love him, and will love anything he does. This is your movie, rent it, or buy it, immediately. Please, don't read the rest of my review.This is an odd low budget, independent film, by first time writer, producer, director, Regina Crosby. The film appears to be mostly autobiographical as revealed in the DVD bonus features. A cheerleader, that isn't stupid, is inspired to write incredible poetry by a creative writing teacher. She develops a deep emotional relationship with a bully boy from the wrong side of the tracks. He torments her in the hallways, in study hall, and in her creative writing class. The film takes place in a tiny town, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. You'll notice that I didn't use any character names, because it's very difficult to tell what is really Regina Crosby and what is fictional in the film.There is ambiguity in the film. If you don't mind a few spoilers, there are several discussions in other Amazon reviews about what really happened at the end of the film. There's a lexicon that Ms. Crosby set up, present day is supposed to be in kind of blown out, muted colors and gray; flashback to the happy times between Amber and Thayer is lit brightly and clear; and bad times in Thayer's house is dirty and smoky. The timeline in the film is turned around with what look like long ago flashbacks, and what looks like present day, and what looks like year ago flashbacks (three time threads flowing in the film). That lexicon should give solid clues to where you are in the timeline; otherwise a viewer will get completely lost watching the film. Sadly, the cues were too subtle, the timeline too jumbled, to really make sense of what is happening when. So in the end, I was confused, and could not figure out the ending. That can be a good thing, in this case it just made the film needlessly confounding.Ms. Crosby is simply too close to all this material to do a good objective job in building a film. The story is about her life. She grew up in the town where she shot this film. The majority of the film is shot in her former High School. The creative writing class uses current day high school students of her mentor master creative writing teacher. She was clearly heavily influenced by this teacher, and she states this is the most true to life character in the film. Sadly, one of the worst performances of the film was by the actor playing this teacher. The cheerleading routines were obsessed over, to the extent of casting two 'All Star' champion adult cheer leaders. All these details simply overshadowed the story.Fine performances were turned in by Noa Hegesh (Amber the lead character) and Scott Michael Foster (Thayer the abused boy from the wrong side of the tracks). The adult performances were not all that great. Study hall teacher was the closest to a real nattering study hall teacher. The creative writing teacher was a caricature of an effective teacher. Pops, the abusive father, was simply awful. Why this high buck actor, Chris Ellis, was brought in to simply grunt is beyond me; anyone could have filled that role.The good news, every shot was rock steady. The cinematography was excellent. I disagree with the post production color and exposure changes in the film to indicate different time lines. Lighting was excellent. Sound was well recorded. An hour and forty six minutes, is about the right length. The pacing is decent.The film is not rated. This is a tough call. There are some mature things shown in the film. The film is mostly about senior year in high school. There is some strong language. There's also some drug use, teenage beer drinking, huffing paint from a bag, and a drug overdose. There are several intense scenes where Thayer is held down by his brother and his father beats him. And there is an attempted incest rape scene. But there is no nudity. It's a strong film, with strong emotions.I believe that Regina Crosby made this film as homage to her teacher. And that is an incredibly wonderful thing. I also think she wanted to get in some digs at other teachers, mainly her cheerleading coach. She was also very sincere in making this film. Probably also wanted to turn stereotypes on their ear, cheerleaders aren't all dumb, and bullies aren't all bad. It was a good first effort for a film. But it would have been a much better movie turned over to another director.I just finished watching three very different films by first time writer / directors. This was the last of the trilogy. For a very different look at how others have approached that first time quandary:Bound (Unrated)(the Wachowski brothers go on to direct Matrix after this film); andAnswer Man.",3,Cheerleaders aren't

While none of them absolutely loved it, it kept the entire class in rapt attention, and no one complained that it was just ""stupid"" or ""boring,"" which is noteworthy. They found Amber Lange and Thayer Mangeress two very well-realized characters, and Amber's poignant closing lines produced a flurry of involuntary hums and sighs. One guy noted that it had a low budget feel, and that he would have liked more special effects, changes in scenery, and everything else that one gets from larger company productions. Duly noted, but I think the lowbudgetness also adds to the simple realism of the film. What my class found most intriguing were the open questions and room for speculation ""Teenage Dirtbag"" leaves regarding what really happens to Thayer's father and brother.""Teenage Dirtbag"" may not be anything truly special, but it accomplishes what its makers set out to do very well: Taut and gripping storyline with excellent acting and characterization.

Evans,"[4, 6]","""Teenage Dirtbag"" is one of those movies that's intentionally oblique; where several key plot and character elements are left fairly open-ended, very possibly in expectation that the audience will think, ""Because I can only half-understand it, it must have a good amount of meaning."" A movie maker or movie-making team has to have some legit creative talent to pull this type of film off. Even with a very low budget, raw talent can still be very evident in a movie, but that's not the case here. What you have instead is choppiness. To boot, there's a ""give-me-a-break"" scene in which a man portrayed to be an inspirational teacher attempts to evoke his students' creativity by lying down on the classroom floor and getting the class to lie down as well. This sadly mirrors the well-known ""Dead Poet's Society"" scene in which Robin Williams, as the same type of teacher, stands on his desk, jumps off, and then prods his students to come up and do the same. Even if this wasn't a conscious rip-off, the writer should have had the sense of awareness to realize that this is how the scene could easily have been perceived, and that such a scene can instantly pull audience members out of the story and into the reality realm of being fully aware that they're simply watching and listening to actors.
