The episodes were unique and not as simplistic as many westerns from this era were.  However in season three it is as if the writers started to run out of ideas and instead of rehashing the old stuff, they went in a new direction.  There are way too many ""comedy"" episodes.  I just don't think this show worked well as a comedy and the the Josh Randall character seemed like a completely different person in these episodes.  The worst one was probably Baa-Baa (he is trying to find someone's lost pet sheep) and Detour wasn't much better (trying to help someone elope with a girl).  I was sad to be finishing this series because I really enjoyed it, but the mixed quality of season 3 has made the ending a little easier.",3,"The worst season, but still worth watching",1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,849,"['have', 'watched', 'three', 'season', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'fantastic', 'second', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'most', 'part', 'episodes', 'were', 'unique', 'not', 'as', 'simplistic', 'many', 'westerns', 'era', 'were', 'However', 'season', 'three', 'writers', 'started', 'run', 'out', 'ideas', 'instead', 'rehashing', 'old', 'stuff', 'went', 'new', 'direction', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'comedy', 'episodes', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'worked', 'well', 'comedy', 'Josh', 'Randall', 'character', 'seemed', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'episodes', 'worst', 'one', 'was', 'probably', 'Baa-Baa', 'trying', 'find', 'someone', 'lost', 'pet', 'sheep', 'Detour', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'trying', 'help', 'someone', 'elope', 'girl', 'was', 'sad', 'be', 'finishing', 'series', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'mixed', 'quality', 'season', '3', 'made', 'ending', 'little', 'easier']",Wanted: Dead or Alive - Season 3
