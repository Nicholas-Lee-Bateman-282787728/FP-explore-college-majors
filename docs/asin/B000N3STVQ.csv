This is the season with Parker Stevenson, who got the job because a few years earlier made  a theatrical movie with Sam Elliott called &#34;Lifeguard.&#34; Also halfway thru they cast the male lifeguard &#34;Cort&#34; who bonded with Hasselhoff's character, Billy Warlock's character, and Stevenson's. The season started with beauty contestant winner Shawn Weatherly but halfway thru the season they decided to go in another direction so she was killed off by a shark. This was also the season that introduced us to Eddie's (Billy Warlock) favorite lifeguard and love interest Shawnie (Erika Eleniak). I remember when after the show ended its NBC run and came back 2 years later that most of the guys were gone,, Shawnie got bustier, Hobie looked different, and the male storylines were gone and they started bringing in sexy Playboy playmates and other sexy women to carry out the storylines.

1052901,A3AD071UEP20WS,B000N3STVQ,"Roger Long ""longrush""","[2, 11]","The adjective ""bad"" is not nearly strong enough to describe this TV series.  Horrible, insulting, stupid, inept...  Nope, I just can't come up with the perfect description.  I didn't watch the series when it was on TV and thought I'd give it a shot on DVD.  Big mistake.First of all, I've been on a good many resort beaches, and they are not inhabited by such bevvies of giggly gaggles of young women in mini-bikinis as we see here.  Rather, there are a great many middle-aged and old people wearing bathing suits that make one want to look elsewhere.  I know because I am one of the latter.The plots of ""Baywatch,"" what there is of them in the individual episodes, are silly.  They consist of showing nubile, would-be starlets romping around on sunny California beaches for no particular reason and body building lifeguards rushing into the surf with red floats to save some poor fool who only addition to the story is drowning.  Most of the females have no speaking lines or mercifully few lines, which is just as well.  When the girls were hired, at the urging of Playboy Magazine, I suspect, learning lines wasn't part of the talents on their resume.  Giggling, yes, speaking, no.The acting of those with speaking roles is laughable.  Of course, given the dialogue written for them, it is somewhat understandable.  The cast does not include one person who could act. Not one.  I managed to sit through four episodes, and in the immortal words of Popeye, ""I can't stands no more.""I realize that some viewers liked this show, and that it was a world-wide phenomonon.

1052902,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000N3STVQ,Sean Pasek,"[21, 21]","I watched this show from the second episode on when it aired on NBC.  I'd missed the pilot for a reason I can't recall, but I enjoyed the show.  It was fun with a pretty good cast.  Then, because it had ranked 50th in the Nielsen ratings, NBC pulled the plug.  Almost two years later, it was finally announced that the show was picked up by another network.  It was never the same after that.  Only Mitch, Eddie, Shaunie, and Garner came back from the original cast.  You could tell immediately that the show just didn't have a quality feel to it that it had in its pilot season.  I watched the show on and off until I'd given up.  After that, the show went ""playmate crazy.""To me, this is the only season of Baywatch that is worth watching. Theacting and stories are much better than what you'd find in the subsequent seasons. While it's true, that the show flaunted female parts, it did focus, to some degree, on the lives and jobs of lifeguards of L.A. County. Granted, they took some liberties with these roles, as you often found Mitch and his friend, Craig Pomeroy (Parker Stevenson) employing themselves as crime-stoppers as well as lifeguards, but you generally gave for a bit of leeway there, because the show was entertaining.  You also have to remember that back then, dramas were not going for a lot of realism.Another advantage this season had were veteran actors such as Monte Markham playing the authoritarian Captain Don Thorpe, who always took his job as a lifeguard captain very seriously, and usually at the expense of all junior lifeguards around him.I think in some regards, the reason the show was so much better, was that they had a bigger budget to work with, being initially with NBC. NBC was also interested in making sure that along with the ""extra skin"" that the show might be used to inspire saftey-consciousness as well.First season sees Mitch battling his ex-wife for custody of Hobe (who was then played by Brandon Call). Call was brilliant in the role, and I felt that Jeremy Jackson wasn't as good in the seasons that followed.Also, Mitch was NOT revealed to be an ex-Navy Seal. While buddy, Cort (John Allen Nelson) was later added to the cast, he was the only one who was considered a former SEAL. As the personal history suggests from this season, Mitch has been a lifeguard for a long time, perhaps going back to high school, along-side best friend, Craig Pomeroy.Eddie Kramer (Billy Warlock) was a rookie lifeguard, alongside Shaunie McClane (Erika Eleniak). Eddie was the hot-headed kid from the wrong side of Philadelphia who loved to spend his free hours boxing. The writers of the show quickly saw that the ""meat"" of their storyline was the relationship between Eddie and Shaunie. Several episodes had storylines surrounding the romance. Warlock and Eleniak eventually became engaged in real life.The cast also included Peter Phelps (Trevor) who played a rogue, Australian lifeguard. He left the show halfway in. Parker Stevenson played Craig Pomeroy, a veteran lifeguard who is torn between being a lifeguard and being a lawyer. His wife, Gina, was played by Holly Gagnier. Finally, there was also Shawn Weatherly (Jill Riley) who was another veteran lifeguard who was famously killed off by a shark attack in the middle of the season.NBC cancelled the show after the first season. The final episode included a marriage proposal by Eddie to Shaunie. Obviously after the show was given the ""go ahead"" by a new network, many of the storylines and origins were either removed altogether or altered in some way.For example, Mitch's budding teenage son, Hobe, was reverted back to a young boy of about 10 or 11. Eddie's propsal to Shaunie was pretty much ditched. Eddie would propose at the end of the next season.Craig Pomeroy would be written out of the show altogether. One can assume that he quit.For me, Baywatch began and ended after its first season, and this is the only season worth owning.Note*  The original theme song (sung by Peter Cetera ""Save Me"") is not used before each episode.  Also, some of the songs used during the episodes have also been changed unfortunately.  It's too bad because the original music and songs were good and went well with the show.",4,The REAL First Season Finally Comes to DVD,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,4212,"['watched', 'show', 'second', 'episode', 'when', 'aired', 'NBC', ""'d"", 'missed', 'pilot', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'was', 'fun', 'pretty', 'good', 'cast', 'Then', 'had', 'ranked', '50th', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'NBC', 'pulled', 'plug', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'finally', 'announced', 'show', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'network', 'was', 'never', 'same', 'Only', 'Mitch', 'Eddie', 'Shaunie', 'Garner', 'came', 'back', 'original', 'cast', 'could', 'tell', 'immediately', 'show', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'quality', 'feel', 'had', 'pilot', 'season', 'watched', 'show', ""'d"", 'given', 'up', 'show', 'went', 'playmate', 'crazy', 'only', 'season', 'Baywatch', 'worth', 'watching', 'Theacting', 'stories', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'what', ""'d"", 'find', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'true', 'show', 'flaunted', 'female', 'parts', 'did', 'focus', 'degree', 'lives', 'jobs', 'lifeguards', 'L.A.', 'County', 'Granted', 'took', 'liberties', 'roles', 'often', 'found', 'Mitch', 'friend', 'Craig', 'Pomeroy', 'Parker', 'Stevenson', 'employing', 'as', 'crime-stoppers', 'as', 'well', 'lifeguards', 'generally', 'gave', 'bit', 'leeway', 'there', 'show', 'was', 'entertaining', 'also', 'have', 'remember', 'back', 'then', 'dramas', 'were', 'not', 'going', 'lot', 'realism.Another', 'advantage', 'season', 'had', 'were', 'veteran', 'actors', 'such', 'Monte', 'Markham', 'playing', 'authoritarian', 'Captain', 'Don', 'Thorpe', 'who', 'always', 'took', 'job', 'lifeguard', 'captain', 'very', 'seriously', 'usually', 'expense', 'junior', 'lifeguards', 'him.I', 'think', 'regards', 'reason', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'had', 'bigger', 'budget', 'work', 'being', 'initially', 'NBC', 'NBC', 'was', 'also', 'interested', 'making', 'sure', 'extra', 'skin', 'show', 'might', 'be', 'used', 'inspire', 'saftey-consciousness', 'well.First', 'season', 'sees', 'Mitch', 'battling', 'ex-wife', 'custody', 'Hobe', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'played', 'Brandon', 'Call', 'Call', 'was', 'brilliant', 'role', 'felt', 'Jeremy', 'Jackson', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'seasons', 'followed.Also', 'Mitch', 'was', 'NOT', 'revealed', 'be', 'ex-Navy', 'Seal', 'buddy', 'Cort', 'John', 'Allen', 'Nelson', 'was', 'later', 'added', 'cast', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'considered', 'former', 'SEAL', 'personal', 'history', 'season', 'Mitch', 'been', 'lifeguard', 'long', 'time', 'perhaps', 'going', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'along-side', 'best', 'friend', 'Craig', 'Pomeroy.Eddie', 'Kramer', 'Billy', 'Warlock', 'was', 'rookie', 'lifeguard', 'alongside', 'Shaunie', 'McClane', 'Erika', 'Eleniak', 'Eddie', 'was', 'hot-headed', 'kid', 'wrong', 'side', 'Philadelphia', 'who', 'loved', 'spend', 'free', 'hours', 'boxing', 'writers', 'show', 'quickly', 'saw', 'meat', 'storyline', 'was', 'relationship', 'Eddie', 'Shaunie', 'Several', 'episodes', 'had', 'storylines', 'surrounding', 'romance', 'Warlock', 'Eleniak', 'eventually', 'became', 'engaged', 'real', 'life.The', 'cast', 'also', 'included', 'Peter', 'Phelps', 'Trevor', 'who', 'played', 'rogue', 'Australian', 'lifeguard', 'left', 'show', 'halfway', 'Parker', 'Stevenson', 'played', 'Craig', 'Pomeroy', 'veteran', 'lifeguard', 'who', 'torn', 'being', 'lifeguard', 'being', 'lawyer', 'wife', 'Gina', 'was', 'played', 'Holly', 'Gagnier', 'Finally', 'was', 'also', 'Shawn', 'Weatherly', 'Jill', 'Riley', 'who', 'was', 'veteran', 'lifeguard', 'who', 'was', 'famously', 'killed', 'off', 'shark', 'attack', 'middle', 'season.NBC', 'cancelled', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'final', 'episode', 'included', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Eddie', 'Shaunie', 'Obviously', 'show', 'was', 'given', 'go', 'ahead', 'new', 'network', 'many', 'storylines', 'origins', 'were', 'either', 'removed', 'altogether', 'altered', 'way.For', 'example', 'Mitch', 'budding', 'teenage', 'son', 'Hobe', 'was', 'reverted', 'back', 'young', 'boy', '10', '11', 'Eddie', 'propsal', 'Shaunie', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'ditched', 'Eddie', 'would', 'propose', 'end', 'next', 'season.Craig', 'Pomeroy', 'would', 'be', 'written', 'show', 'altogether', 'One', 'can', 'assume', 'quit.For', 'Baywatch', 'began', 'ended', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'season', 'worth', 'owning.Note*', 'original', 'theme', 'song', 'sung', 'Peter', 'Cetera', 'Save', 'Me', 'not', 'used', 'episode', 'Also', 'songs', 'used', 'episodes', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'changed', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'bad', 'original', 'music', 'songs', 'were', 'good', 'went', 'well', 'show']",Baywatch: Season 1
