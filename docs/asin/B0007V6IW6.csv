But this is Dawson's Creek so things are never so easy.  This is a mostly enjoyable season, though the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is due to how the death of Dawson's father was handled.  We see Dawson attempting therapy but we never find out how that went.  So that seemed somewhat unrealistic to me.

Fourth season wasn't one of the best either but at least the dvd had some extras.

891672,A27SZZ6L43MXDX,B0007V6IW6,B. Millett,"[18, 29]","This was an interesting season.  The first season is pure gold, great writing, stories etc.  The show becomes like a drug after that, season's two and three were also both great for seperate reasons, both capturing the magic and even though it declined throughout the seasons; the smart writing of the show.  Season 4 is also really good, it starts to lose some of its appeal and you can notice some holes in the show but is still more  addicting than crack.Which brings us to season 5, the writing took a nose dive and the show kind of went all over the place...literally and figuretivly.  It was interesting to watch for a few reasons, one being it was cool to see the charecters we have grown and love leave capeside and live in the 'real world.'  Another being Dawson and Joey, even though by season three you were sick of them and more than happy to welcome Pacey and Joey with open arms, irrationally bringing back the Dawson/Joey saga and incorporating a Dawson/Jen hookup brought the season a nostalgic feel. Those were the positive points, other than that it was great to see them change some things up a bit but they completely just said screw it with the charecter developtment they had worked up for the past four seasons with some of the charecters, such as Jack & Joey.  Joey just randomly hooking up and Jack becoming massive partier.Over all it is a good season for fans who have followed the show, but the writing suffered, the charecters suffered, and there were a lot of holes in the show, it was good for a teen drama, but as oppossed to the smart self aware show it was when it first waltzed on the WB it was a shell of its former self, however it still was vastly better than the completely ""hurts to watch"" sixth season (with the exception of the serise finale.)

891676,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0007V6IW6,Chris Kennison,"[3, 3]","The characters were all seperated and it kept the drama and the interesting interaction and dramatic life moments spread out and minimum.The season was less interesting than the previous, with the exception of some very major moments in Dawson's family. The relationships were less interesting. I mean, Charlie & Joey??? Give me a break.But the main thing that bugged me was the grasping for straws storytelling and the technical disasters. The writing? First of all. Charlie asks Joey to front his band. Huh? She jumped up on stage one time in a fit of wild inhibition, and in the following episodes, she doesn't sing once. Then she's asked to front his band... she doesn't practice... she just hops up there and knows the songs and has never once worked with the band who's performing before a packed bar. Ridiculous.Jen (Michelle Williams) bounced around like a jack rabbit for a lot of the season. She is forced to act so corny about Dawson and their relationship it was at times, horribly annoying. This girl must have an identity crisis because she's played so many different personalities in this series, it isn't even funny.Then there's the writing. So, why is it that all of the people that Dawson, Joey, Pacey & Jen meet... talk the same way they do? With the same sarcasm and pop culture humor. These people are completely random encounters who've never talked to them before... but yet, they talk the same way??Like, the drug dealing mugger from episode ""Downtown Crossing"". Joey is being held at gunpoint, but she talks to him like he's Pacey annoying her. Meanwhile, the mugger/gunmen is slinging the same, pop culture reference dialogue at her that has been such a fixture with the show. Could the writers not give him another voice? A unique voice? I thought maybe the mugger grew up with them, or was hiding in Dawson's Capeside closet when they were talking.The same goes for Professor David Wilder. Apparently Pop culture conversation and dialogue is a class that everyone can take.I guess the show only had one writer.The ratings plummeted during this season, causing the following season to be the last. I didn't watch the show when it aired, I purchased the DVDs and watched them. There were many times when I felt bad for the actors in the show. Many times they were put in really silly situations and you can obviously see that they had to grin and bare it.All in a days work.

891677,AW7CV7F94ULDU,B0007V6IW6,"Chris ""www.twitter.com/chrisMibacache""","[1, 1]","After a average fourth season which quickly became dull after the never ending battles to win Joey's affection (Dawson and Pacey), Season 5 of Dawson's Creek was bound to be a breath of fresh air. The characters left Capeside to go to college in California and Boston, and the Joey-Dawson-Pacey problems were finally resolved. The truth is, after reading one too many reviews on how mediocre this Fifth season was, I was definitely reluctant to but it. What I found after watching the first few episodes, was that the Fifth season turned out to be my favourite season in a very long time. Dawson's Creek definitely dried out in Seasons 3 and 4, with random unnecessary character additions and the same old conflict going on and on, which eventually dragged out over the entire season. Season 5 is refreshing. The characters have definitely matured and became more fun to watch. Every character had a story going on which became interesting to watch as the season progressed. The season finale was definitely one of the highlights as you cannot wait to see what happens in the following final season. Of course with every good season, it has its downers.There are some episodes which have ""unbelievable"" story lines and ones that you don't care for a whole lot, but the good outweighs the bad in this situation.THE DVD SET:The music used in the original airings of the show have basically all been deleted for new, possibly less exciting music. Some scenes have been deleted too (only for music rights) involving Joey and Audrey singing live on stage. The DVD picture quality is not anything spectacular, as it often appears grainy and blurry at times. But on my version of the season, they spread all 23 episodes out on to 6 discs, instead of the American version with only 4 discs, which has to be a bit better for the quality.There are absolutely NO extras to be found on this set, which is a major disappointment because these have some very important episodes which deserve at least one audio commentary! This season is all about change after all! A little background info would be nice.Overall, despite the disappointing extras snub, the episodes are entertaining and definitely rejuvenate the show, especially after a somewhat boring fourth season. The reason why this season is so appealing to me is because the characters are much more likable, they have a sense of humor this time around and are not afraid to try something new.",4,New setting breathes new life into the show!,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,2437,"['average', 'fourth', 'season', 'quickly', 'became', 'dull', 'never', 'ending', 'battles', 'win', 'Joey', 'affection', 'Dawson', 'Pacey', 'Season', '5', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'was', 'bound', 'be', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'characters', 'left', 'Capeside', 'go', 'college', 'California', 'Boston', 'Joey-Dawson-Pacey', 'problems', 'were', 'finally', 'resolved', 'truth', 'reading', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'reviews', 'how', 'mediocre', 'Fifth', 'season', 'was', 'was', 'definitely', 'reluctant', 'What', 'found', 'watching', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'Fifth', 'season', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'favourite', 'season', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'definitely', 'dried', 'out', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'random', 'unnecessary', 'character', 'additions', 'same', 'old', 'conflict', 'going', 'eventually', 'dragged', 'out', 'entire', 'season', 'Season', '5', 'refreshing', 'characters', 'have', 'definitely', 'matured', 'became', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'Every', 'character', 'had', 'story', 'going', 'became', 'interesting', 'watch', 'season', 'progressed', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'highlights', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'following', 'final', 'season', 'course', 'good', 'season', 'are', 'episodes', 'have', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'lines', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'whole', 'lot', 'good', 'bad', 'situation.THE', 'DVD', 'SET', 'music', 'used', 'original', 'airings', 'show', 'have', 'basically', 'been', 'deleted', 'new', 'possibly', 'less', 'exciting', 'music', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'too', 'only', 'music', 'rights', 'involving', 'Joey', 'Audrey', 'singing', 'live', 'stage', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'anything', 'spectacular', 'often', 'grainy', 'blurry', 'times', 'version', 'season', 'spread', '23', 'episodes', 'out', '6', 'discs', 'instead', 'American', 'version', 'only', '4', 'discs', 'be', 'bit', 'better', 'are', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'extras', 'be', 'found', 'set', 'major', 'disappointment', 'have', 'very', 'important', 'episodes', 'deserve', 'least', 'one', 'audio', 'commentary', 'season', 'change', 'little', 'background', 'info', 'would', 'be', 'nice.Overall', 'disappointing', 'extras', 'snub', 'episodes', 'are', 'entertaining', 'definitely', 'rejuvenate', 'show', 'especially', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'fourth', 'season', 'reason', 'why', 'season', 'so', 'appealing', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'likable', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'try', 'something', 'new']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fifth Season

I never watched the show when it was on the air until the last few episodes, but I have enjoyed the first four DVD sets and was interested to see how the show changed once the kids left Capeside for college.As season five begins, we find Dawson at film school in California, Joey at Worthington College in Boston and Jack and Jen close by at Boston Bay College. Pacey, fresh off his summer working on a yacht, is living in a boat in Boston Harbor and as the season begins, only Jen knows he is there.Things change quickly for everyone as the season gets under way. Dawson realizes that he misses being with Joey and decides he wants to move to Boston to be near her. But the sudden death of his father changes everything, pushing him away from Joey and eventually into a relationship with Jen. Jack quickly joins a fraternity and his brothers soon begin to take priority over school and his high school friends. Pacey realizes that he has a talent for cooking when he gets a job in a restaurant and Joey finds herself attracted to her professor.James Van Der Beek is again solid as Dawson, though you have a hard time, as in years past, believing that he is the age that he is. The dialogue throughout the series has always been over the top, which is really what makes the show what it is. His emotion at the death of his father, and his need to be there for his mother is heart wrenching at times. He finally confronts his feelings by going to a therapist to sort out his feelings. It is these emotions that lead him to his relationship with Jen, one that ends before the season concludes, but brings back memories for viewers from the original season of the show.Michelle Williams as Jen really sees a variety of different roles throughout the season. You see her as the girlfriend to Dawson, but as the relationship slowly begins to fade, you see her trying not to hurt his feelings, yet still keep herself somewhat sane. Her friendship with Jack goes from hot to cold to back to hot again and at the end of the season, she is off to spend the summer with her parents.As Jack, Kerr Smith is again a strong member of the cast. He confronts a lot of emotions when he joins a fraternity and finds out that he is simply being used to fill a quota. Eventually the fact that he is gay leads him to leave the fraternity. While he is there however, he takes to drinking way too much, and falls behind in his schoolwork and also becomes estranged from Jen for a period of time, a relationship that heals by the season's end.Joshua Jackson's Pacey is the one character of the group that is not in college, but he is living nearby in a friend's boat as the season begins. Eventually he takes a job at a restaurant and finds out that he has a real talent for it and is put in charge of the kitchen when his boss leaves. He also begins a relationship with Audrey (Busy Phillips), Joey's college roomate, a relationship that reminds one of the relationship he had with Joey, something that really makes him happy.Of course Katie Holmes as Joey Potter was one of the most beautiful women on television at the time and in this season, you get to see her as a college freshman. Her almost affair with a professor and her attraction to a guy who cheated on Jen show a different side to Joey Potter than most people are used to after four years of getting to know her. Perhaps her best episode of the series was the one where she was mugged and helped the mugger after he was hit by a car. This episode featured just this story line and was very powerful.Busy Phillips, as Audrey, guest starred in almost every episode and was added as a series regular in t he final season. Mary Beth Piel's Grams is still a cast regular, as she moves to Boston and houses Jen, Jack and eventually Dawson. She really is a fantastic character, one that provides that motherly advice that young people always need. Mary Margaret Humes, a cast regular for the first four years, appears sporadically as Dawson's mom Gail. John Wesley Shipp also appears in a few episodes as Mitch Leery, before he dies in a car crash. The third former cast regular Nina Repeta, appears in a few episodes as Joey's sister Bessie.Of course there is the guest star appearances of a couple of people from other shows. Chad Michael Murray is now the star of One Tree Hill. Sherrilyn Fenn was on a number of shows, including Twin Peaks. Phillips was on Freaks and Geeks.This set could have easily been rated five stars from this reviewer, but there were no extras at all. Each of the other four sets has at least a commentary track or two for the fans, but this set featured nothing, which was disappointing. Also, the theme song is again replaced, which is what viewers have come to expect over the last few seasons. It would be nice if they brought back Paula Cole for season six, but I kind of doubt it will happen.",4,I don't want to wait for our lives to be over,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,5132,"['One', 'biggest', 'reasons', 'enjoy', 'television', 'so', 'much', 'escape', 'incredible', 'boredom', 'life', 'little', 'anyway', 'take', 'somebody', 'else', 'problems', 'live', 'lives.This', 'certainly', 'case', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'four', 'DVD', 'sets', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'changed', 'once', 'kids', 'left', 'Capeside', 'college.As', 'season', 'five', 'begins', 'find', 'Dawson', 'film', 'school', 'California', 'Joey', 'Worthington', 'College', 'Boston', 'Jack', 'Jen', 'close', 'Boston', 'Bay', 'College', 'Pacey', 'fresh', 'off', 'summer', 'working', 'yacht', 'living', 'boat', 'Boston', 'Harbor', 'season', 'only', 'Jen', 'there.Things', 'change', 'quickly', 'everyone', 'season', 'way', 'Dawson', 'being', 'Joey', 'move', 'Boston', 'be', 'sudden', 'death', 'father', 'changes', 'everything', 'pushing', 'away', 'Joey', 'eventually', 'relationship', 'Jen', 'Jack', 'quickly', 'fraternity', 'brothers', 'soon', 'begin', 'take', 'priority', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'Pacey', 'talent', 'cooking', 'when', 'job', 'restaurant', 'Joey', 'attracted', 'professor.James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'again', 'solid', 'Dawson', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'years', 'believing', 'age', 'dialogue', 'series', 'always', 'been', 'top', 'really', 'what', 'show', 'what', 'emotion', 'death', 'father', 'need', 'be', 'there', 'mother', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'times', 'finally', 'feelings', 'going', 'therapist', 'sort', 'out', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'lead', 'relationship', 'Jen', 'one', 'season', 'back', 'memories', 'viewers', 'original', 'season', 'show.Michelle', 'Williams', 'Jen', 'really', 'variety', 'different', 'roles', 'season', 'see', 'girlfriend', 'Dawson', 'relationship', 'slowly', 'fade', 'see', 'trying', 'not', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'yet', 'still', 'keep', 'somewhat', 'sane', 'friendship', 'Jack', 'hot', 'cold', 'back', 'hot', 'again', 'end', 'season', 'spend', 'summer', 'parents.As', 'Jack', 'Kerr', 'Smith', 'again', 'strong', 'member', 'cast', 'lot', 'emotions', 'when', 'fraternity', 'out', 'simply', 'being', 'used', 'fill', 'quota', 'Eventually', 'fact', 'gay', 'leave', 'fraternity', 'there', 'however', 'drinking', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'behind', 'schoolwork', 'also', 'becomes', 'estranged', 'Jen', 'period', 'time', 'relationship', 'heals', 'season', 'end.Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Pacey', 'one', 'character', 'group', 'not', 'college', 'living', 'nearby', 'friend', 'boat', 'season', 'Eventually', 'job', 'restaurant', 'out', 'real', 'talent', 'put', 'charge', 'kitchen', 'when', 'boss', 'also', 'relationship', 'Audrey', 'Busy', 'Phillips', 'Joey', 'college', 'roomate', 'relationship', 'one', 'relationship', 'had', 'Joey', 'something', 'really', 'happy.Of', 'course', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Joey', 'Potter', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'television', 'time', 'season', 'get', 'see', 'college', 'freshman', 'almost', 'affair', 'professor', 'attraction', 'guy', 'who', 'cheated', 'Jen', 'show', 'different', 'side', 'Joey', 'Potter', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'used', 'four', 'years', 'getting', 'know', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'episode', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'was', 'mugged', 'helped', 'mugger', 'was', 'hit', 'car', 'episode', 'featured', 'just', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'very', 'powerful.Busy', 'Phillips', 'Audrey', 'guest', 'starred', 'almost', 'episode', 'was', 'added', 'series', 'regular', 't', 'final', 'season', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Piel', 'Grams', 'still', 'cast', 'regular', 'Boston', 'houses', 'Jen', 'Jack', 'eventually', 'Dawson', 'really', 'fantastic', 'character', 'one', 'motherly', 'advice', 'young', 'people', 'always', 'need', 'Mary', 'Margaret', 'Humes', 'cast', 'regular', 'first', 'four', 'years', 'sporadically', 'Dawson', 'mom', 'Gail', 'John', 'Wesley', 'Shipp', 'also', 'few', 'episodes', 'Mitch', 'Leery', 'car', 'crash', 'third', 'former', 'cast', 'regular', 'Nina', 'Repeta', 'few', 'episodes', 'Joey', 'sister', 'Bessie.Of', 'course', 'guest', 'star', 'appearances', 'couple', 'people', 'other', 'shows', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'now', 'star', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'Sherrilyn', 'Fenn', 'was', 'number', 'shows', 'including', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Phillips', 'was', 'Freaks', 'Geeks.This', 'set', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'rated', 'five', 'stars', 'reviewer', 'were', 'extras', 'other', 'four', 'sets', 'least', 'commentary', 'track', 'two', 'fans', 'set', 'featured', 'nothing', 'was', 'disappointing', 'Also', 'theme', 'song', 'again', 'replaced', 'what', 'viewers', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'brought', 'back', 'Paula', 'Cole', 'season', 'six', 'kind', 'doubt', 'will', 'happen']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fifth Season

My favourite scene in this season - the one where Jen is debating going on a trip to Costa Rica with Jack or to spend the summer with her parents - was completely ruined by a change in music. The original, ""Teenage Wasteland"" by the Who, was switched out for an upbeat song that did not convey the mood of the scene at all. Yes she was dancing on a chair, but Jen was dealing with angst over a dilemma, not having a pajama party! Then of course the scene where Joey's singing with Charlie's band. Again we can see that the studios just do not care that they're butchering a much loved show.

891688,A1CGF9EUDEUQJA,B0007V6IW6,Rodrigo Medina,"[3, 3]","People tend to say that ""Dawson's Creek"" was over at season 4 and that the following two seasons were terrible. I don't agree, though I recognize that seasons 5 and 6 were not as good at the precedents. Anyway, it's always interesting to find out what happened to the characters after they leave Capeside and have to face new challenges.When season 4 was over, I was worried about the show and how the creators would manage to keep the characters together, after they all left to college. The solution was good. Jen, Jack and Joey go to a college in Boston. Pacey gets a job at the same city and Dawson, who decided to go to USC, changes his choice, after a tragic accident.Season 5 surely has its highlights. We are presented to Audrey, the messy roomate of Joey at college, who joins the gang for the last two seasons. Jack decides to join a broterhood, learning not to trust his new ""friends"". Joey becomes more independent and free, learning with Audrey that life can also be fun, and it's not only demanding! On season 5, Dawson finally looses his virginity with his first girlfriend, Jen. I love the season 5 finale, which reminds a romantic comedy, with people arriving and departuring from an airport.Dawson's Creek is a TV classic, which deserves to be watched several times in your life. Who doesn't like the eternal love triangle Dawson-Joey-Pacey, with great dialogues and drama?

Pacey is still hands down the most realistic,with Audrey a close second and Joey.. We may as well start calling Dawsons Creek *Joeys Creek* this season five is mostly about her, thats not to say this is a bad thing. AND the episode downtown crossing was brilliant.. I loved it.. everything about season five is bland and pretty played out about mid season and this episode sparked some real thought and tension. I completely see and understand other viewers comments and opinions saying season five is garbage and the show doesnt come back alive till mid way through season six.. Im so tempted to just skip a bunch of this drab, but i know there are plot points being made that will make the world right in season six..  ugg  im just ready for season 5 to be over..  only my will power to watch the entire full series keeps me faithfull..  thank goodness i bought season 5 used on amazon for like #12.00  To be continued when i finish the season.  I want to add that i think its sad, they could have written season five so much better, its the first season away from capeside and a chance to realy pump up the temp and the stakes of the show.. it feels like a half effort in my opinion.  To be Continued...UPDATE: I finished season 5 last night, and yeah, its garbage.. ugg what a waste of my time !  I started season 6 last nite as well and im upset, WHY ? Becouse its season six and its hardly any different than season 5 a few episodes into it.. i sure hope other reviewers are right when they say the show comes back alive mid seson 6.

891692,A2GWY78Y3YZ1I6,B0007V6IW6,Transfigured Knight,"[0, 0]","The fifth season saw alot of change for Dawson, Joey, Pacey, Jen, and Jack, but it also brought a more ""adult"" and loose feeling to the cast that, otherwise, wasn't there in seasons 1-4. Having said that, I feel that this season isn't as strong as other seasons, but it still worth the watch. I definitely think if you skip this season, then you will not get the season six. The reason I said that is because I quit watching Dawson's Creek around the middle of this season. I quit watching not because I thought it wasn't any good at the time, but rather that I was really busy with work and school.Anyway, this season as I said, brings forth change, but one thing remains is the Joey-Dawson-Pacey love triangle and the Jen and Jack friendship. College really messes these characters up. They find themselves in a new environment with new characters like Audrey (Joey's college roommate), whom I think isn't that great of a character, but does add a nice break from the five.People can say what they want to about this season. I like it. I know it's not as good as the other seasons, but it does have an interesting feel that the other seasons didn't. Things change and so do people. This is most comfortable I've seen these characters since their early beginnings in Capeside. It's definitely a different season, but I think it's a very welcoming change that has some interesting plots and twists.",4,Pretty Good Season.

This makes some of the episodes drag on in a tiresome fashion.Otherwise, the hilarious Busy Phillips is a great addition as Pacey's girlfriend Audrey, while Jordan Bridges is very watchable and animated as Dawson's filmmaking partner Oliver.  Jen doesn't do a whole lot this time besides spin records, hang out with Jack, and deal poorly with Dawson.  And the Joey-and-Dawson show continues on its twisted way.  There is a great episode, though, called ""Downtown Crossing,"" in which Joey is faced with a mugger who is then run over.  It's quite emotional but not terribly sappy.Jack is the biggest disappointment here, shooting pool and drinking instead of studying.  (In fact...when does anyone in this college ever study? And how do they do on their tests?  This isn't addressed clearly.)This season is okay as a bridge to the next one, but it's just okay as a standalone.",4,"Some dull spots, but mostly solid",1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,968,"['College', 'life', 'presented', 'being', 'rather', 'dull', 'here', 'even', 'dorms', 'new', 'episodes', 'drag', 'tiresome', 'fashion.Otherwise', 'hilarious', 'Busy', 'Phillips', 'great', 'addition', 'Pacey', 'girlfriend', 'Audrey', 'Jordan', 'Bridges', 'very', 'watchable', 'animated', 'Dawson', 'filmmaking', 'partner', 'Oliver', 'Jen', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'time', 'spin', 'records', 'hang', 'out', 'Jack', 'deal', 'poorly', 'Dawson', 'Joey-and-Dawson', 'show', 'twisted', 'way', 'great', 'episode', 'called', 'Downtown', 'Crossing', 'Joey', 'faced', 'mugger', 'who', 'then', 'run', 'over', 'quite', 'emotional', 'not', 'terribly', 'sappy.Jack', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'here', 'shooting', 'pool', 'drinking', 'instead', 'studying', 'fact', 'when', 'anyone', 'college', 'ever', 'study', 'how', 'do', 'do', 'tests', ""n't"", 'addressed', 'clearly', 'season', 'okay', 'bridge', 'next', 'one', 'just', 'okay', 'standalone']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fifth Season
