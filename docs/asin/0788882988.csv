Just google ""Jim Emerson"" and you'll find it.Read Jim Emerson on NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and read a letter Emerson received from a viewer of the film. I promise you that these two commentaries on this film will help you better appreciate it.What I want to say here is something people have to understand is that a movie is not only about what it is about but also HOW it's about, what it's about. OK? Meaning is to be found in the way the story is told and what is left out of a picture sometimes adds to the picture. Less can be more and what is not there can say just as much, if not more, than what is.Let go of super conventional western/American hang-ups about having a concise, tiddy ending. It ends exactly where it needs to. The way the movie comes to a close has to do with what the story itself is about.

84806,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,0788882988,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 7]","Times have changed. Surely that's what Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) has in mind when he visits an old friend and commiserates about how things ain't like they used to be.  ""This land's hard,"" muses his friend.  Another police friend has examples of kids with green hair and bones in their noses who have left out ""Sir,"" and ""Ma'am"" out of their vocabulary.  They both shake their heads over ""The dismal tide"".But, really we're not all that ready for the events that happen, either.  Significantly, a chilling psychopath, Chigurh (Javier Bardem) goes on a rampage, slipping out of a U.S. border town deputy's hands with the coolest and calloused of skill. He's involved with a drug ring, one that has a shoot out that's left about a dozen dead in the desert.  Besides a gun that has the force of a lightening bolt, his weapon of choice is an electrical device--one that's meant to quickly put cattle out of their misery (something like a hydrolic nail dispenser).  Just like Tommy Lee Jone's portrayal of Two Face in 'Batman Forever'Batman Foreverhis bitterness of fate has his victims choosing heads or tails in a coin toss, meant to mirror the randomness of bitter fortune in his own life.  The difference is that in the 'Batman' movie it was campy; here it comes across with deadly solemnity--one that hits you right between the eyes.  The only one who comes the closest to understanding him is Carson Wells, (Woody Harrelson), a man with corporate ties whose one conversation reveals quite a lot.So it goes with the rest of the movie.  A Vietnam vet, Llewelyn (Josh Brolin), takes the center stage.  While hunting antelope in the desert, he comes across the aftermath of the shootout and discovers a cache' of money.  He isn't too forthcoming with his wife, Clara Jean (Kelly Macdonald), but he's on a mission as someone who hasn't seen too many breaks in his own life.  Chigurh's stalking has so many twists to it that I found myself craning my neck as if I had to look around the corner from getting shot.  It's all cat and mouse, and the villain seems to almost possess an unnerving omniscience for anyone who gets in his way.  Chigurh eventually uses Clara Jean as bait for Llewllyn to give the money back.  While I've seen many movies where the villain uses the spouse as bait, this movie rendered it so refreshingly original, I felt I was watching this plot component for the first time.It has been said that the Coen Brothers are masters of plot.  Here they draw from the same-titled novel by Cormac McCarthy.  While I haven't read the novel, I am grateful that, although I'm a big Coen Brothers fan, they didn't resort to kidnapping in any frame of the movie.  Besides that I never knew where this movie was going.  There's still the ingenuity of the Coen Brothers' irony, but they rely heavily on one of the most chilling portrayals of any villain I can think of in cinematic history.  This movie is also the most violent of any I've seen this year.  (Considering I've seen '3:10 to Yuma' and 'Eastern Promises' among them, that's saying a lot.)For all it's innovation and startling violence, 'No Country for Old Men' has to be one of the tensest and best movies woven together all year.(The special features are worthwhile.  I must note that if you're looking for a definite commentary for the ending, you'll need to look elsewhere [although they certainly explain the theme well which is at least half of the framed ending.]  ""Working with the Coens"" goes for less than eight minutes.  Commentary on the movie is worthwhile and clocks in at about 23:00.  There's also a worthy third section that is approximately seven minutes long. For me I couldn't get enough.  If you don't mind going behind the curtain to see the secrets of the magic show, then the extras are quite worthwhile.  [Within Amazon Miles Moore's commentary ""Yes, Virginia, There's a Plot Resolution in 'No Country for Old Men'"" illuminated a lot for me.  Some other discussions suffice.]  I think Cormac McCarthy wanted people to have the theme and concepts stuck in their heads rather than a neat resolution.  Real life is often like that.  I keep thinking of real life serial killers:  Son of Sam and The Zodiac Killer.  Justice catches up to them, but some things in life are elusive--just like the movie.  I like being able to glimpse Sherrif Bell's head at the end.  ""You don't know what He (God) thinks,"" says Bell's friend, played by Barry Corbin.  (This character is essential for assuaging Bell from stepping into the chasms of pride and despair.)  I think there's hope ""kindled"" in Bell's mind at the end, but you can buy this film and watch it over and over again and decide for yourself.)",5,"""The Dismal Tide""",1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,4690,"['Times', 'have', 'changed', 'Surely', 'what', 'Sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'mind', 'when', 'old', 'friend', 'commiserates', 'how', 'things', 'ai', ""n't"", 'used', 'be', 'land', 'hard', 'friend', 'police', 'friend', 'examples', 'kids', 'green', 'hair', 'bones', 'noses', 'who', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'Sir', ""Ma'am"", 'vocabulary', 'shake', 'heads', 'dismal', 'tide', '.But', 'really', ""'re"", 'not', 'ready', 'events', 'happen', 'Significantly', 'chilling', 'psychopath', 'Chigurh', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'rampage', 'slipping', 'U.S.', 'border', 'town', 'deputy', 'hands', 'coolest', 'calloused', 'skill', 'involved', 'drug', 'ring', 'one', 'shoot', 'out', 'left', 'dozen', 'dead', 'desert', 'gun', 'force', 'lightening', 'bolt', 'weapon', 'choice', 'electrical', 'device', 'one', 'meant', 'quickly', 'put', 'cattle', 'misery', 'something', 'hydrolic', 'nail', 'dispenser', 'Just', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jone', 'portrayal', 'Two', 'Face', ""'Batman"", ""Forever'Batman"", 'Foreverhis', 'bitterness', 'fate', 'victims', 'choosing', 'heads', 'tails', 'coin', 'toss', 'meant', 'mirror', 'randomness', 'bitter', 'fortune', 'own', 'life', 'difference', ""'Batman"", 'movie', 'was', 'campy', 'here', 'deadly', 'solemnity', 'one', 'right', 'eyes', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'closest', 'understanding', 'Carson', 'Wells', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'man', 'corporate', 'ties', 'one', 'conversation', 'quite', 'lot.So', 'rest', 'movie', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'Llewelyn', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'center', 'stage', 'hunting', 'antelope', 'desert', 'aftermath', 'shootout', 'cache', 'money', ""n't"", 'too', 'forthcoming', 'wife', 'Clara', 'Jean', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'mission', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'breaks', 'own', 'life', 'Chigurh', 'stalking', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'found', 'craning', 'neck', 'had', 'look', 'corner', 'getting', 'shot', 'cat', 'mouse', 'villain', 'almost', 'possess', 'unnerving', 'omniscience', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'Chigurh', 'eventually', 'Clara', 'Jean', 'bait', 'Llewllyn', 'give', 'money', 'back', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'movies', 'where', 'villain', 'spouse', 'bait', 'movie', 'rendered', 'so', 'refreshingly', 'original', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'plot', 'component', 'first', 'time.It', 'been', 'said', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'are', 'masters', 'plot', 'Here', 'draw', 'same-titled', 'novel', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'am', 'grateful', ""'m"", 'big', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'resort', 'kidnapping', 'frame', 'movie', 'never', 'knew', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'still', 'ingenuity', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'irony', 'rely', 'heavily', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'portrayals', 'villain', 'can', 'think', 'cinematic', 'history', 'movie', 'also', 'most', 'violent', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Considering', ""'ve"", 'seen', '3:10', 'Yuma', ""'Eastern"", 'Promises', 'saying', 'lot', 'innovation', 'startling', 'violence', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'be', 'one', 'tensest', 'best', 'movies', 'woven', 'together', 'year', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'must', 'note', ""'re"", 'looking', 'definite', 'commentary', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere', '[', 'certainly', 'explain', 'theme', 'well', 'least', 'half', 'framed', 'ending', ']', 'Working', 'Coens', 'less', 'eight', 'minutes', 'Commentary', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'clocks', '23:00', 'also', 'worthy', 'third', 'section', 'approximately', 'seven', 'minutes', 'long', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'going', 'curtain', 'see', 'secrets', 'magic', 'show', 'then', 'extras', 'are', 'quite', 'worthwhile', '[', 'Amazon', 'Miles', 'Moore', 'commentary', 'Yes', 'Virginia', 'Plot', 'Resolution', ""'No"", 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'illuminated', 'lot', 'other', 'discussions', 'suffice', 'think', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'wanted', 'people', 'have', 'theme', 'concepts', 'stuck', 'heads', 'rather', 'neat', 'resolution', 'Real', 'life', 'often', 'keep', 'thinking', 'real', 'life', 'serial', 'killers', 'Son', 'Sam', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'Justice', 'up', 'things', 'life', 'are', 'elusive', 'just', 'movie', 'being', 'able', 'glimpse', 'Sherrif', 'Bell', 'head', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'God', 'Bell', 'friend', 'played', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'character', 'essential', 'assuaging', 'Bell', 'stepping', 'chasms', 'pride', 'despair', 'think', 'hope', 'kindled', 'Bell', 'mind', 'end', 'can', 'buy', 'film', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'decide']",N/A

So, I would have to disagree with Roger Ebert's proclamation that this film is flawless. This film has a lot to offer to people who have a dedicated taste in movies and who don't get bored easily.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A drug deal in Texas goes sour, drug dealers end up dead. Then a man discovers the crime scene, and takes some things he shouldn't have (Some guns and $2 million in drug money). After he takes this money he sets off a deadly game of kill-or-be-killed when the killer comes back for the money and discovers it's gone. He hunts the man who took the money and won't let up, and even kills anyone who gets in his way to finding this man.MUSIC: There is no music, it's like watching an Albert Hitchcock film. This is one of the reasons I find the movie to be flawed is the complete absence of music.ACTION: This film can be suspenseful, bloody, and just downright violent. There are quite of few shooting scenes as well, which adds to great action.ENTERTAINMENT: Usually this film is quite entertaining, but sometimes the dialogue goes on for toooo long (The coin toss scene is the biggest one). This film has its share of satisfying, suspenseful, and surprising moments of violence, but then I can't help but get pissed at the terrible ending (You don't end a movie like that, dammit!). You will enjoy this film if you have fairly decent taste in movies, but be warned of the long dialogue and bad ending.OVERALL: If you're not sure about it, rent it first. This film caters to more specific tastes in movies, so be warned.THE GOOD: Good bloody action, suspenseful scenes, and quite a few surprising moments.THE BAD: Awful ending, no music.",4,AN ENTERTAINING AND COMPELLING MOVIE  8.5 OUT OF 10,1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,1763,"['enjoyed', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'was', 'entertaining', 'compelling', 'film', 'was', 'flawed', 'same', 'time', 'So', 'would', 'have', 'disagree', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'proclamation', 'film', 'flawless', 'film', 'lot', 'offer', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'dedicated', 'taste', 'movies', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'drug', 'deal', 'Texas', 'sour', 'drug', 'dealers', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'Then', 'man', 'crime', 'scene', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'guns', '2', 'million', 'drug', 'money', 'money', 'off', 'deadly', 'game', 'kill-or-be-killed', 'when', 'killer', 'back', 'money', 'gone', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'money', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'even', 'kills', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'finding', 'man.MUSIC', 'music', 'watching', 'Albert', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'one', 'reasons', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'flawed', 'complete', 'absence', 'music.ACTION', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'bloody', 'just', 'downright', 'violent', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'action.ENTERTAINMENT', 'Usually', 'film', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'dialogue', 'toooo', 'long', 'coin', 'scene', 'biggest', 'one', 'film', 'share', 'satisfying', 'suspenseful', 'surprising', 'moments', 'violence', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'pissed', 'terrible', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'movie', 'dammit', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'have', 'fairly', 'decent', 'taste', 'movies', 'be', 'warned', 'long', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'ending.OVERALL', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'rent', 'first', 'film', 'caters', 'more', 'specific', 'tastes', 'movies', 'so', 'be', 'warned.THE', 'GOOD', 'Good', 'bloody', 'action', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'quite', 'few', 'surprising', 'moments.THE', 'BAD', 'Awful', 'ending', 'music']",N/A

If you're looking for that, rent a Michael Bay film (Transformers, Pearl Harbor)The actors portraying the characters are all on point; the art of acting at it's finest in my opinion. Josh Brolin's role is, for lack of a better phrase, a ""beer drinking redneck"". Quiet as kept, this Vietnam War vet wants nothing more than to smooth out a situation that, in some ways, unexpectedly landed in his lap. The suspense begins when we find out that a homicidal maniac(Javier Bardem) is after that same incentive. Tommy Lee Jones is the rugged Texas Sheriff placing the pieces together as the story unfolds; this role was made for him.As it was put in another review, the principle of the film is ""fate and circumstance"", a signature style of the Coen Brothers. The consequences of the character's actions impact the film greatly, so don't upset yourself at a sudden twist of outcome; this picture displays the fact that resolution and success is not always a likely result, sometimes matters go unsolved and/or astray.

A deputy is attacked by a prisoner who gets away to kill a man. Another man hunts antelopes and sees a group of cars with dead bodies around them! A pickup truck there is filled with packages. He sees a dying lone man with a satchel full of $100 bills. A drug deal gone bad? He leaves with the satchel of money and returns home to his wife. After dark he returns to the crime scene. [A fatal mistake?] He is chased by men and a vicious dog. He runs away, then shoots the dog. A customer talks to a store owner on strange topics. At night men look over a car. The law is on the trail of a killer, and finds the drug deal scene with the bodies. The killer visits the trailer park to look for Llewelyn. So does the Sheriff. Moss looks for a place to hide that satchel - in an air conditioning duct! Telephone records leave a backtrail.That entry wound in the forehead left no bullet! Moss buys a shotgun, then returns to the motel. An electronic device is used to locate that satchel! [A lesson in found treasure?] But Moss escapes. A man is hired to search for that killer. Moss searches the satchel and finds that device. But someone is still on his trail! There is a silenced shooting. Night time shooting does not cause an alarm? Moss dumps that satchel by the border, then crosses the border to find a doctor. That killer stages an explosion so he can loot a pharmacy and steal medicine and supplies to treat wounds. Mr. Wells finds Moss in a hospital and bargains for the money; he warns him about that killer. The sheriff talks to Mrs. Moss about her husband. The killer finds Mr. Wells in his hotel and talks for a while. The killer knows where Moss is, and asks for the money.Crimes are detected when something happens to attract attention. Moss continues to hold on to that satchel. A friendly stranger helps an old woman with her suitcases. A man stops to help a stranded motorist. [It's the law in some states.] The Sheriff finds Moss at the motel after others have found him. He visits an old man to talk about quitting. Mrs. Moss finds an uninvited visitor in her home. He flips a coin, and leaves. There is an accident at a stoplight. The killer walks away, his arm in a sling. The Sheriff talks to his wife about his past life; he is now retired. And then the film ends!What happened to the rest of the story? Until this it was better than earlier Coen Bros. products because it was adapted from a successful novel. Do the Coen Bros. have a fatal flaw that prevents them from making a good product?This is a story about a chase for unearned wealth, like ""The Maltese Falcon"" but without the happy ending. There is a coldness to this story and its characters that seems unusual. Note the phrase ""last man standing"" in the beginning. Does this movie have any redeeming social value? The fatal flaw of Llewelyn was taking a satchel of money that didn't belong to him, and not reporting the dead bodies to the police. It brought grief and misery instead of promised joy. Then, he went back to that crime scene and got identified by the other criminals (who must have had night vision binoculars).",3,A Drug Deal Gone Bad,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,3215,"['Country', 'Old', 'Men', '2007', 'filmSheriff', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'had', 'job', 'age', '25', 'talks', 'experiences', 'deputy', 'attacked', 'prisoner', 'who', 'away', 'kill', 'man', 'man', 'antelopes', 'group', 'cars', 'dead', 'bodies', 'pickup', 'truck', 'filled', 'packages', 'dying', 'lone', 'man', 'satchel', 'full', '100', 'bills', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', 'satchel', 'money', 'home', 'wife', 'dark', 'crime', 'scene', '[', 'A', 'fatal', 'mistake', ']', 'chased', 'men', 'vicious', 'dog', 'away', 'then', 'dog', 'customer', 'talks', 'store', 'owner', 'strange', 'topics', 'night', 'men', 'look', 'car', 'law', 'trail', 'killer', 'drug', 'deal', 'scene', 'bodies', 'killer', 'trailer', 'park', 'look', 'Llewelyn', 'So', 'Sheriff', 'Moss', 'place', 'hide', 'satchel', 'air', 'conditioning', 'duct', 'Telephone', 'records', 'leave', 'backtrail.That', 'entry', 'wound', 'forehead', 'left', 'bullet', 'Moss', 'shotgun', 'then', 'motel', 'electronic', 'device', 'used', 'locate', 'satchel', '[', 'lesson', 'found', 'treasure', ']', 'Moss', 'man', 'hired', 'search', 'killer', 'Moss', 'satchel', 'device', 'someone', 'still', 'trail', 'silenced', 'shooting', 'Night', 'time', 'shooting', 'not', 'cause', 'alarm', 'Moss', 'satchel', 'border', 'then', 'border', 'find', 'doctor', 'killer', 'explosion', 'can', 'loot', 'pharmacy', 'steal', 'medicine', 'supplies', 'treat', 'wounds', 'Mr.', 'Wells', 'Moss', 'hospital', 'bargains', 'money', 'killer', 'sheriff', 'talks', 'Mrs.', 'Moss', 'husband', 'killer', 'Mr.', 'Wells', 'hotel', 'talks', 'while', 'killer', 'where', 'Moss', 'money.Crimes', 'are', 'detected', 'when', 'something', 'attract', 'attention', 'Moss', 'hold', 'satchel', 'friendly', 'stranger', 'old', 'woman', 'suitcases', 'man', 'help', 'stranded', 'motorist', '[', 'law', 'states', ']', 'Sheriff', 'Moss', 'motel', 'others', 'have', 'found', 'old', 'man', 'talk', 'quitting', 'Mrs.', 'Moss', 'uninvited', 'visitor', 'home', 'coin', 'accident', 'stoplight', 'killer', 'away', 'arm', 'sling', 'Sheriff', 'talks', 'wife', 'past', 'life', 'now', 'retired', 'then', 'film', 'What', 'happened', 'rest', 'story', 'was', 'better', 'earlier', 'Coen', 'Bros.', 'products', 'was', 'adapted', 'successful', 'novel', 'Do', 'Coen', 'Bros.', 'have', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'making', 'good', 'product', 'story', 'chase', 'unearned', 'wealth', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'happy', 'ending', 'coldness', 'story', 'characters', 'unusual', 'Note', 'phrase', 'last', 'man', 'standing', 'beginning', 'movie', 'have', 'redeeming', 'social', 'value', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'Llewelyn', 'was', 'taking', 'satchel', 'money', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'not', 'reporting', 'dead', 'bodies', 'police', 'brought', 'grief', 'misery', 'instead', 'promised', 'joy', 'Then', 'went', 'back', 'crime', 'scene', 'got', 'identified', 'other', 'criminals', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'night', 'vision', 'binoculars']",N/A

84818,A10UGG54QNH71L,0788882988,"Alex S ""Blurb""","[3, 7]","The Coen brothers have done it again. Even a mediocre Coen film, such as ""The Ladykillers"" or ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is above-average, always impeccably shot, directed and acted. When they fire on all cylinders though, they are unbeatable. Such were the cases with ""Miller's Crossing"", the best film of 1990; ""Fargo"", the best film of 1997; and now ""No Country for Old Men"", the best film of 2007.Based on prolific writer Cormac McCarthy's transcendent novel, the film, like its source, is a meditation on good vs. evil, masqueraded as a thriller. It is told in a brutal, laconic style that is uncompromising in its intensity.A man (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a couple of dead bodies while hunting out in the Texan desert. They all have bullet-holes, guns; he finds drugs, which leads him to finding the money as well. A lot of money. More than enough to make sure he and his wife (Kelly McDonald) can get the hell out of their trailer. The only problem is, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), the personification of all senseless evil, is on his trail. And on Chigurh's trail is an honest sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones), as well as a sleazy bounty hunter (Woody Harrelson).All the actors shine, particularly Bardem. The scenes where he asks his victims to flip a coin to determine whether or not he kills them are electric. There is nothing in his dark eyes, no soul, no remnants of human feeling... Chigurh is a merciless creature, functioning purely on a 'kill-or-be-killed' basis. Life means nothing to him, perhaps not even his own.While Javier Bardem owns the screen, the rest of the cast is uniformly excellent. Josh Brolin mesmerizes with his intensity in an almost-speechless role. Woody Harrelson's part is small, albeit memorable. And Tommy Lee Jones, a true screen veteran, holds his own as the ageing sheriff who confronts his helplessness against contemporary evil, evil that has no reasoning beyond the flip of a coin. He's seen it all, and yet he still wonders why. The experience is in his wrinkly eyes.The Coen brothers sure keep the pace going throughout the film. The suspense is unbearable. There are sequences of such intensity they will make your rip off the edge of your seats from clutching them so tight. But then there is also unexpected lyricism, as when genuinely good - maybe flawed in their own ways, but at least human - folk encounter the unspeakable terror that is Anton Chigurh, or when the sheriff contemplates the futility of their efforts against something bigger, more powerful than they could ever handle.""No Country for Old Men"" is seemingly simple but rather existential - it sneaks up on you, instead of hammering its messages into your head. It's the best kind of morality play.

84820,AGEIT17HENDIS,0788882988,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","Cinematic studies of murderous psychopaths have a long and honored position in film history. Early on in the gangster movies of the 1930s, in such films as The Petrified Forest (with Humphrey Bogart as Duke Mantee) and, perhaps more famously, White Heat with true stone-killer mad man James Cagney ready to blow up everything (and throw an off-hand grapefruit or two), audiences got to confront truly banal (thanks Hannah Arendt) evil characters. Remorseless, if not always efficient. The psycho (played understatedly by Javier Bardem)in No Country For Old Men  written by Cormac McCarthy) carries on that tradition, although as we are now a little more inured to mass murders and odd-ball methods of killing on the screen that those earlier audiences, the methods have been ramped up. In short, take no prisoners. None. Moreover, the Brothers Coen want to, around the murder and mayhem, squeeze in a little tale about how this country (well, Texas, great American West country, Larry McMurtry Last Picture Show country, anyway) has gone to hell in a handbasket since the old western frontiers vanished into, well, civilization.Of course no savage tale of the New West, the border New West, would be complete without some drug deal going south (no pun intended), going south badly. The action of this film is centered on a discover of some dough, some serious dough, just waiting to be plucked like taking it from the low branches of a tree by the first guy (played by Josh Brolin) who comes on the scene, the first hungry, break-out hungry guy who comes along. Now if you or I, maybe not hungry enough, came upon a desert scene with a bunch of stone shoot-out dead bodies, a truckload of dope, and a satchel of dough, we would walk, hell, run away, right. There would be no story then though. So our lonesome hungry cowboy grabs for the brass ring. Unfortunately said dough belongs to those who have hired a bad-ass stone killer ready, very ready, and very willing to exterminate whatever number it takes to get said dough back. And throw in a few innocent by-standers and others for laughs.But this is Texas remember and so once the chase is on the local law, in the person mainly, of one wised-up, old-timey sheriff, played by Tommy Lee Jones, a little out of his element in these new times when there is no honor among thieves (there really never was) and the crimes pile up more quickly and haphazardly than in the old days, is on the hunt. But age and world-weariness have taken their toll and old Tommy Lee is always about a step, maybe two steps, behind the central action.

84821,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,0788882988,Alistair McHarg,"[34, 66]","When an A student comes home with a C- it's a lot more disappointing than when a C student comes home with a D.  From the very beginning, the Coen brothers have been in my personal pantheon of favorite writer/directors - even their failures are better than the successes of lesser practitioners.  Coen brother films could be relied upon for sturdy craftsmanship, memorable characters, keen intelligence, dry - even lethal - wit, and the ability to dance easily between the absurd and the vividly authentic.  Even lesser films like The Big Lebowski (very dumb) and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (ham-fisted) stood head and shoulders above everyday Hollywood fare.  That's why it's so ironic the Academy swooned over NCFOM, the worst movie these two prodigies have produced.Unlike so many of their contemporaries, the Coen brothers never succumbed to the style-over-content trap - until now.  For them, character always drove plot, protagonists were interesting and well drawn - not to say quirky.  The gushing over this film's first act, with its lovely desert footage, elegant pacing, and atmosphere - conveniently glosses over the complete lack of action - or point.  Llewelyn Moss, Josh Brolin, stumbles over a drug deal gone bad and unwisely takes the money he finds. (Brolin is actually quite good as a doomed idiot.)  This act prompts what some would describe as action, or story.  Tommy Lee Jones essentially channels himself as aging Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell.  While his hangdog expression - painted on a face resembling 40 miles of bad road - ""says"" that the violence of this day is beyond his comprehension, the story does not.  That's a pity - since that is allegedly the film's theme.  TLJ moping doth not a movie make.Coen brothers films are always characterized by black comedy - think back to the white glove and knife in Blood Simple.  One must wonder what happened to their sense of humor.  NCFOM is devoid of irony, wit, or even the ability to poke fun at its own pompousness.  Woody Harrelson's pointless stroll through the scenery might have been intended as funny, I hope not; it's dreary filler that arrives when the film is already dragging.  More egregious still is the body count.  The Coen brothers have certainly killed off quite a few characters over the years, but in the past there was always a reason, it was integral to the plot.  The killing in NCFOM is relentless, pointless, and repulsive.  Apologists would say; this IS the point, the merciless, unending nature of violence.  My response is that this is a movie, not a philosophical debate.  The moment you have symbols instead of protagonists, you're in trouble.Which brings us inevitably to Anton Chigiurh, played by Javier Bardem.  Mr. Bardem must get points for not giggling while sporting his ludicrous haircut.  But the Academy was just flat-out wrong.  His character is one-dimensional and his performance is one-dimensional - at least Bergman had the creativity to put Death in a Speedo and cape.  The celebrated ""coin-toss"" scene is indeed wonderful, but it's a very small moment of excellence in a large, arid landscape.

In fact, that's an overstatement. Every aspect of this piece, though seemingly and strategically understated, is wonderfully choreographed to keep from doing what Hollywood usually does -- going over the top for effect. NO COUNTRY... accomplishes its profound statement -- that life, anymore, is just about as bizarre and violent as one can imagine -- without having to force things at all.Much has been said about the violence of this film and the Coen Brothers' penchant for callous insensitivity toward human suffering. Accordingly, I expected a gratuitous blood bath like the one the Coen's presented in FARGO.  Nothing of the sort materializes. Instead, while the violence is graphic and, at times, stark, it isn't overdone for shock or effect.  Death here is simply the flipside of life. It begins and it ends with equal emotion and suddenness. To have presented things otherwise, with the melodramatic, shrieking, sobbing emotions that usually attend the subject, would have been to create an irreconcilable incongruity in the character of Anton Chigurh -- the maniacal murderer played here by Oscar winner, Javier Bardem -- a violent sociopath who carries out his carnage as if he were selling magazine subscriptions.The movie is a masterpiece. The Coens' ""every man's"" script, delivered wonderfully by Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, Barry Corbin and, of course, by Bardem, is set against the arid, sweeping panoramas of southern Texas. It's all about life but, then, it really isn't.

84833,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,0788882988,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[44, 98]","[..]I was not biased against the film when I saw it.  I loved ""The Big Lebowski"", and was even amused by the similar theme in the two: both involve a suitcase full of money which the main character carts around, for events to get the suitcase lost, and inevitably leave the audience in the dark as to the eventual fate of the money.Unfortunately, as great as the movie started out, it devolved into pretentious art-film-like moviemaking and a muddled ending with no clear ending.  Not defined ending or happy ending, but CLEAR ending.  The whole thing came to an abrupt end like a train that hits an invisible wall at low speed.The cinematography was something worth an Oscar in itself, and I especially loved the way it was shot when Llewellyn discovered the botched drug deal and eventually the money.  It was so realistic, you could almost feel the mucky grime of blood drying in the sand or the greasiness of an overused dumptruck, the plainness of the brand-less milk, all the homey settings of a western border-city.The character Llewellyn isn't very likeable.  He reminds me something of The Dude in that he's very much aloof to the horrors of seeing the shot-up drug dealers, and casually takes their money and goes home, suddenly remembering one of the dying men asked him for water, and deciding to go back with a gallon of tap water for him, until Anton Shigurh comes after him and he panics, and is forced to become resolute.In the beginning, Anton Shigurh, played by Javier Bardem, seemed the ideal villain; quiet, utterly irredeemable, seeming the kind of person who would kill someone at any moment without any sort of honor.  Even the scene where he makes a shopkeep gamble on his life with the flip of his coin, you fully expect Anton to kill him at any moment, even when he lets the man live.At about the mid-way point of the movie, it starts to unravel.  Perhaps I need to see the movie again, but for the life of me, I cannot begin to wonder what Tommy Lee Jones's character's purpose in the movie is.  He promises Llewellyn's wife that he'll make sure Llewellyn lives, and goes about doing nothing but reading the newspaper and lounging about in the office or at a diner.  Only once does he visit the crime scene, and towards the end does he come close to the killer.Next come the nameless character played by Woody Harrelson, and the oh-so-elegantly named ""Man in the Office"" played by Stephen Root.  Woody Harrelson's character describes Anton for us, and then wanders off to meet with Llewellyn, and then get killed by Anton for some reason.  Anton then randomly appears in the Office man's office and kills him in the middle of interviewing some guy for a job.  Anton doesn't say anything of worth to the other man, and is then back to the western area chasing Llewellyn.  I have no idea what that was supposed to be about.The thing is a mess, as the movie skips ahead slightly with Llewellyn dead, and Anton flustered that he lost the money.  In a moment that completely changes my opinion of Anton from cold, calculating, assassin of pure evil, to a pitiful, pathetic, stubborn childish creature that kills Llewellyn's wife just because Llewellyn didn't let Anton kill him.For some random reason, as Anton is driving off from her house, he gets hit by a car, staggers out with a broken arm, and walks away.For another random reason, Tommy Lee Jones's character has some retrospect, then gives a long, rambling soliloquey about a dream he had.  I have heard many accents, and I have very sharp hearing.  I can understand some of the most rambling of mumblings and mutterings, but for the life of me, I could not understand more than a few words of Tommy Lee Jones's heavily accented, mumbling, rambling speech about dreaming about his father.And it suddenly ended with ""And then I woke up.""",1,Muddled and unclear story becomes most overrated near-classic this side of,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3816,"['[', '..', ']', 'was', 'not', 'biased', 'film', 'when', 'saw', 'loved', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'was', 'even', 'amused', 'similar', 'theme', 'two', 'involve', 'suitcase', 'full', 'money', 'main', 'character', 'carts', 'events', 'get', 'suitcase', 'lost', 'inevitably', 'leave', 'audience', 'dark', 'eventual', 'fate', 'money.Unfortunately', 'as', 'great', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'devolved', 'pretentious', 'art-film-like', 'moviemaking', 'muddled', 'ending', 'clear', 'ending', 'Not', 'defined', 'ending', 'happy', 'ending', 'CLEAR', 'ending', 'whole', 'thing', 'came', 'abrupt', 'end', 'train', 'invisible', 'wall', 'low', 'speed.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'something', 'Oscar', 'especially', 'loved', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'when', 'Llewellyn', 'discovered', 'botched', 'drug', 'deal', 'eventually', 'money', 'was', 'so', 'realistic', 'could', 'almost', 'feel', 'mucky', 'grime', 'blood', 'drying', 'sand', 'greasiness', 'overused', 'dumptruck', 'plainness', 'brand-less', 'milk', 'homey', 'settings', 'western', 'border-city.The', 'character', 'Llewellyn', ""n't"", 'very', 'likeable', 'something', 'Dude', 'very', 'much', 'aloof', 'horrors', 'seeing', 'shot-up', 'drug', 'dealers', 'casually', 'money', 'home', 'suddenly', 'remembering', 'one', 'dying', 'men', 'asked', 'water', 'deciding', 'go', 'back', 'gallon', 'tap', 'water', 'Anton', 'Shigurh', 'forced', 'become', 'resolute.In', 'beginning', 'Anton', 'Shigurh', 'played', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'seemed', 'ideal', 'villain', 'quiet', 'utterly', 'irredeemable', 'seeming', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'kill', 'someone', 'moment', 'sort', 'honor', 'Even', 'scene', 'where', 'shopkeep', 'gamble', 'life', 'flip', 'coin', 'fully', 'expect', 'Anton', 'kill', 'moment', 'even', 'when', 'man', 'mid-way', 'point', 'movie', 'unravel', 'Perhaps', 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'wonder', 'what', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'character', 'purpose', 'movie', 'Llewellyn', 'wife', ""'ll"", 'make', 'sure', 'Llewellyn', 'doing', 'nothing', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'lounging', 'about', 'office', 'diner', 'Only', 'once', 'visit', 'crime', 'scene', 'end', 'come', 'close', 'killer.Next', 'come', 'nameless', 'character', 'played', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'oh-so-elegantly', 'named', 'Man', 'Office', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'character', 'Anton', 'then', 'wanders', 'meet', 'Llewellyn', 'then', 'get', 'killed', 'Anton', 'reason', 'Anton', 'then', 'randomly', 'Office', 'man', 'office', 'middle', 'interviewing', 'guy', 'job', 'Anton', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'worth', 'other', 'man', 'then', 'back', 'western', 'area', 'chasing', 'Llewellyn', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'about.The', 'thing', 'mess', 'movie', 'ahead', 'slightly', 'Llewellyn', 'dead', 'Anton', 'flustered', 'lost', 'money', 'moment', 'completely', 'opinion', 'Anton', 'cold', 'calculating', 'assassin', 'pure', 'evil', 'pitiful', 'pathetic', 'stubborn', 'childish', 'creature', 'Llewellyn', 'wife', 'just', 'Llewellyn', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'Anton', 'kill', 'him.For', 'random', 'reason', 'Anton', 'driving', 'off', 'house', 'hit', 'car', 'staggers', 'out', 'broken', 'arm', 'walks', 'away.For', 'random', 'reason', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'character', 'retrospect', 'then', 'long', 'rambling', 'soliloquey', 'dream', 'had', 'have', 'heard', 'many', 'accents', 'have', 'very', 'sharp', 'hearing', 'can', 'understand', 'most', 'rambling', 'mumblings', 'mutterings', 'life', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'more', 'few', 'words', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'heavily', 'accented', 'mumbling', 'rambling', 'speech', 'dreaming', 'father.And', 'suddenly', 'ended', 'then', 'woke', 'up']",N/A

In the case of ""No Country for Old Men"", they are very much at the thriller end.The basic plot is that Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across a scene of carnage whilst in the Texas backwoods hunting for antelope.  There are multiple bodies (both human and canine), a huge haul of drugs and a bag containing $2 million in bank notes.  Moss takes the notes and returns home before making the questionable decision of returning to the scene.  It is at this point that his life makes a decided turn for the worse.  He begins to be pursued by Chirgurh (Javier Bardem), who is surely one of the most relentless and chilling killers in modern cinema.  He will use any method to kill but his preferred means is the cattle gun using compressed air.  Need more be said?I was unable to count the number of murders in this film.  The squeamish at heart should think twice before seeing this movie.  It's certainly not the conventional date film.Yet for all its murder and mayhem, ""No Country for Old Men"" remains a compelling film.  The viewer is drawn into the web of destruction.

84836,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0788882988,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","`No Country for Old Men' could, for some, get lost in its own hype and wind up being that movie that everyone said you needed to see but proved to leave you wondering why everyone was so excited about it in the first place.  It's become so over praised that one walks into it expected the second coming, and for many that is just not what they are going to witness.But I urge you to pay close attention...because this movie is much more than you may think.`No Country...' is a very well rounded and extremely well crafted thriller that never lets go of its unnerving pace and opens itself up for an intriguing study of humanity at its worst.  It's a very, very good movie; a great movie at that; one that you will thoroughly enjoy and want to revisit time and time again.The film follows Llewelyn Moss, an army vet who just so happens to stubble upon some drug money.  Fully aware of the danger he's subjecting himself and his wife to he decides to take the money and run.  What he doesn't realize is that the man responsible for the `danger' is not anything Llewelyn will be able to stand against.  Anton Chigurh is death; plain and simple.  Chigurh pursues Llewelyn with reckless abandon while Moss' wife Carla Jean tries to keep a level head about the whole episode.  Llewelyn is also being pursued by the local Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell; an old timer who has just about had enough of what this `country' has turned into.What helps elevate this film from standard thriller to exceptional cinema is the masterful cast; from the actors to the directors.  Everyone involved in this film delivers top notch.  Josh Brolin has been tampering with fame for a long time now and finally he's starred in something to be proud of.  His portrayal of Llewelyn Moss is fantastically tempered and controlled.  Tommy Lee Jones is also marvelous here.  This is how I like my Jones; raw and emotionally crippled.  He plays the down trodden `thinker' extremely well.  Kelly Macdonald is flawless here, utterly flawless.  She serves as a beating heart in a film filled to the brim with apathy.The film though belongs to Javier Bardem.  Everything that has been said about this man and his performance is true.  He is commanding and relentlessly savage.  There's a grin that appears on his face often within this film, a grin that gives way to his menacing insanity; a grimace that cements the character of Anton Chigurh in our minds forever.  While I won't be one to say that Chigurh is as masterful a creation as Hannibal Lecter I will say that he is one of the most memorable and interesting villains ever to appear on the big screen.I will say that there is no way that Bardem is `supporting' in this film for he has more screen time then any other actor and really, in the end, the film is all about him.Joel and Ethan Coen masterfully wade through Cormac McCarthy's orgasmic novel and deliver a very faithful adaptation.  Having just recently read the novel myself I was floored at how accurate a translation this film proved to be.  That said, there are two scenes within the novel; my two favorite scenes at that; that were not represented well here.  The first is not even part of the movie, and that is when Llewelyn picks up a young hitchhiker.  They have a very deep and moving conversation that engrossed me so much that I was disappointed to see it completely snubbed here.  The second is that of Carla Jean and Anton's unfortunate meeting.  That meeting is here in the film, and it is probably the most moving scene in the film, but it's not given the attention it deserved.  In the novel the scene is a little more lengthy and it's `completed'; here, in the film, it's left a little too `wide open'.Those two issues are not enough to really complain about for the film is so smooth and so masterfully constructed that those minor squabbles are easily forgiven.The Coen's have built a well oiled and hard working machine that offers the audience a `complete' experience.  This is not a film built on mere acting or a well written script.  It is a film that has those two things and then some.  The film is a marvel to watch.  The cinematography, while not showy, is commanding and awe inspiring.  It captures the mood and emotion that this film sets out to create.  The editing of this film is probably the finest I've seen all year.  It's such a smooth ride; each scene masterfully running into the next.  Another thing I appreciated is the lack of score here.  I love a good score, but what the Coen's have done here was allow the film to speak for itself.  The silence is unsettling and it forces the audience to fall inside the events on screen.  This also allows us to truly pay attention to the small details; the footsteps, gun clicks and heavy breathing; all of which heighten the intensity of the film.On the outset, `No Country for Old Men' may seem like an above average thriller; but there is so much more to this film then drugs, money and murder.  Sure, it is not flawless but it's a film that is perfectly flawed, in that its flaws seem to embellish its beauty.  The characters are walking flaws; the situation is a huge flaw; its reasoning is flawed, but in the end those flaws equal one amazing experience for they expose the imperfection that is this `country'.",5,You can't stop what's coming; but why would you want to?,1205452800,"03 14, 2008",2008,5271,"['Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'could', 'get', 'lost', 'own', 'hype', 'wind', 'up', 'being',

84837,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,0788882988,Andy Orrock,"[1, 1]","I had read Cormac McCarthy's book upon its original paperback release.  Like many, I looked forward to the movie...especially after learning that long-time personal favorite Javier Bardem would play Anton Chigurh.  He didn't disappoint.  I thought both he and Josh Brolin were outstanding.  And, no doubt Ed Tom Bell could have been written with Tommy Lee Jones and his now-patented world-weariness in mind.The Coen Brothers' adaptation excels in clarifying some of the narrative of McCarthy's work.  The writer's prose is so terse at times that I had trouble following who was providing what side of a conversation.  The movie also firmly sets the action in the early 80s, thanks to cars, clothes and Bardem's god-awful haircut.  Also, the staging of the aftermath of the bloodbath in the desert is brilliant.  It captures the bleak, spooky, riveting and ultimately fateful nature of Llewelyn Moss's (Brolin) chance discovery in the desolate outskirts of a small west Texas town (hello, Marfa, TX!).All that aside, I enjoyedMichael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)even more.  I thought it was the best thing I saw in 2007.  So, I gave that directorial debut from Tony Gilroy five stars and 'No Country' gets four here.",4,Bardem and Brolin are the standouts in this adaption of Cormac McCarthy's work,1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,1215,"['had', 'read', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'book', 'original', 'paperback', 'release', 'many', 'looked', 'forward', 'movie', 'especially', 'learning', 'long-time', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'would', 'play', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'thought', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'were', 'outstanding', 'doubt', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'now-patented', 'world-weariness', 'mind.The', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'adaptation', 'excels', 'clarifying', 'narrative', 'McCarthy', 'work', 'writer', 'prose', 'so', 'terse', 'times', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'who', 'was', 'providing', 'what', 'side', 'conversation', 'movie', 'also', 'firmly', 'action', 'early', '80s', 'thanks', 'cars', 'clothes', 'Bardem', 'god-awful', 'haircut', 'Also', 'staging', 'aftermath', 'bloodbath', 'desert', 'brilliant', 'bleak', 'spooky', 'riveting', 'ultimately', 'fateful', 'nature', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Brolin', 'chance', 'discovery', 'desolate', 'outskirts', 'small', 'west', 'Texas', 'town', 'hello', 'Marfa', 'TX', '.All', 'aside', 'enjoyedMichael', 'Clayton', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'even', 'more', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'saw', '2007', 'gave', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'five', 'stars', ""'No"", 'Country', 'four', 'here']",N/A
84838,A2IIC3NBR966LL,0788882988,antaylor,"[5, 6]","I refrained from seeing No Country for Old Men for a good few months. I didn't go to the cinema to watch it and I waited a day or so once I rented it. I was not overly eager to see it as I had a feeling I was going to be underwhelmed. Even with the Oscar and the glittering critical acclaim, I just knew it wouldn't be anything special and I was right.There was a time when I was a big Coen's fan but I feel like I have outgrown them if that's the right word. I remember as a film student being wowed by their films' quirkiness, style and cleverness. However, I now find myself wanting more from a `good' film, for example, real emotional involvement, psychological realism e.g. the characters behaving as they probably would were they real people, characters that show development or different sides to them. This has always been the Coen's biggest weakness - providing characters that we really care about, that are interesting in more ways than just being fun to watch because of their exaggerated mannerisms. Barton Fink was an exception, John Turturro was amazing and we sort of cared for him and Francis McDormand in Fargo and Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski were similar but even then, there was always an element of cartoonishness about them. I find myself agreeing more and more with those reviewers who were always more reserved in their appreciation of the Coen's, citing their works as placing more importance in the style rather than the content.Why does Bardem's killer use the cattle stun gun? He's shown us that he's more than willing to use a silenced shotgun to do his dirty work so why lug around this huge bulky chunk of metal? It's no quieter or less messy than his shotgun. I haven't read the book so I don't know whether it is a Coen invention but it seems to be nothing more than a shallow stylistic device. Again with Bardems 60's style bobbed hair style - this must surely be a Coen invention since they have a history of adorning their characters with bizarre hairstyles - again it is nothing more than a shallow stylistic device to say, `look, this is a Coen film'! And some of the dialogue! For instance, the much quoted line where Brolin's character asks his wife to tell his mum he loves her if he doesn't return - yes it's very snappy dialogue but exists for no other reason than that and would only really work if we were to believe that a man had forgotten his mother had died. Hmmm.No Country is a good film. It is enjoyable and there are some decent set pieces where the tension and suspense is quite high and it's good to see the Coen's exercising some restraint but apart from the `indie' ending, there is nothing really to separate it from any other high end Hollywood thriller but the critics will have you believe it is something so much more. It isn't and don't let the injections of an old man's musings or a killer's deterministic speeches make you think it is.In fact, how can the film really be about the changing face of America or fate - these are huge grand themes and ones that would benefit from a very different sort of approach. Perhaps something more akin to a multi stranded approach like the way Crash dealt with racism - something that justifies or `proves' its message by using an assortment of situations and relations. Taking a small crime story that really focuses on three men and saying this represents worldly change is stretching it to say the least. And then the story shoots itself in the foot and contradicts itself completely towards the end when Tommy Lee Jones' character visits his uncle and his uncle relays him the story of a violent past event way back in 1901, the point being that the world has always been a violent place and it is not getting worse as the poor sheriff thinks!So what is the film trying to say??? One minute it seems to suggest the world is becoming increasingly hostile and the next minute it says that it's always been like this! I remember Seven played around with the same theme.I actually liked the ending, I thought it was nicely understated and shows how things can fizzle out and be left unresolved. I didn't care to know whether or not Bardem killed the wife, because it wasn't at all important to the story (although I feel the Coen's may have given a clue e.g . Bardem checks the soles of both his shoes as he leaves the house, perhaps checking for blood stains? - it doesn't really matter anyhow).A previous reviewer compared No Country to The Terminator and I would agree. No Country is basically a suspenseful genre movie about a man being chased by a seemingly unstoppable killer (there's even a scene where he `repairs' himself). Yes the acting, injections of wit and cinematography are up to the usual high Coen's standards but I personally didn't find the film to be exhilarating or refreshing or particularly deep and meaningful. It's a good genre movie, sadly nothing else.",3,Nothing special,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,4889,"['refrained', 'seeing', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'good', 'few', 'months', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'cinema', 'watch', 'waited', 'day', 'so', 'once', 'rented', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'eager', 'see', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'underwhelmed', 'Even', 'Oscar', 'glittering', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'just', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'special', 'was', 'right.There', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'big', 'Coen', 'fan', 'feel', 'have', 'outgrown', 'right', 'word', 'remember', 'film', 'student', 'being', 'wowed', 'films', 'quirkiness', 'style', 'cleverness', 'However', 'now', 'find', 'wanting', 'more', 'good', 'film', 'example', 'real', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'psychological', 'realism', 'e.g', 'characters', 'behaving', 'probably', 'would', 'were', 'real', 'people', 'characters', 'show', 'development', 'different', 'sides', 'always', 'been', 'Coen', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'providing', 'characters', 'really', 'care', 'are', 'interesting', 'more', 'ways', 'just', 'being', 'fun', 'watch', 'exaggerated', 'mannerisms', 'Barton', 'Fink', 'was', 'exception', 'John', 'Turturro', 'was', 'amazing', 'sort', 'cared', 'Francis', 'McDormand', 'Fargo', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'were', 'similar', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'always', 'element', 'cartoonishness', 'find', 'agreeing', 'more', 'more', 'reviewers', 'who', 'were', 'always', 'more', 'reserved', 'appreciation', 'Coen', 'citing', 'works', 'placing', 'more', 'importance', 'style', 'rather', 'content.Why', 'Bardem', 'killer', 'cattle', 'stun', 'gun', 'shown', 'more', 'willing', 'use', 'silenced', 'shotgun', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'so', 'why', 'lug', 'huge', 'bulky', 'chunk', 'metal', 'quieter', 'less', 'messy', 'shotgun', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Coen', 'invention', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'shallow', 'stylistic', 'device', 'Again', 'Bardems', '60', 'style', 'bobbed', 'hair', 'style', 'must', 'surely', 'be', 'Coen', 'invention', 'have', 'history', 'adorning', 'characters', 'bizarre', 'hairstyles', 'again', 'nothing', 'more', 'shallow', 'stylistic', 'device', 'say', 'look', 'Coen', 'film', 'dialogue', 'instance', 'much', 'quoted', 'line', 'where', 'Brolin', 'character', 'wife', 'tell', 'mum', ""n't"", 'return', 'yes', 'very', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'other', 'reason', 'would', 'only', 'really', 'work', 'were', 'believe', 'man', 'had', 'forgotten', 'mother', 'had', 'died', 'Hmmm.No', 'Country', 'good', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'decent', 'set', 'pieces', 'where', 'tension', 'suspense', 'quite', 'high', 'good', 'see', 'Coen', 'exercising', 'restraint', 'apart', 'indie', 'ending', 'nothing', 'really', 'separate', 'other', 'high', 'end', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'critics', 'will', 'have', 'believe', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'more', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'injections', 'old', 'man', 'musings', 'killer', 'deterministic', 'speeches', 'make', 'think', 'is.In', 'fact', 'how', 'can', 'film', 'really', 'be', 'changing', 'face', 'America', 'fate', 'are', 'huge', 'grand', 'themes', 'ones', 'would', 'benefit', 'very', 'different', 'sort', 'approach', 'Perhaps', 'something', 'more', 'akin', 'multi', 'stranded', 'approach', 'way', 'Crash', 'dealt', 'racism', 'something', 'proves', 'message', 'using', 'assortment', 'situations', 'relations', 'Taking', 'small', 'crime', 'story', 'really', 'three', 'men', 'saying', 'worldly', 'change', 'stretching', 'say', 'least', 'then', 'story', 'shoots', 'foot', 'completely', 'end', 'when', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'character', 'uncle', 'uncle', 'story', 'violent', 'past', 'event', 'way', 'back', '1901', 'point', 'being', 'world', 'always', 'been', 'violent', 'place', 'not', 'getting', 'worse', 'poor', 'sheriff', 'thinks', 'So', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'say', 'One', 'minute', 'suggest', 'world', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'hostile', 'next', 'minute', 'always', 'been', 'remember', 'Seven', 'played', 'same', 'theme.I', 'actually', 'liked', 'ending', 'thought', 'was', 'nicely', 'understated', 'how', 'things', 'can', 'fizzle', 'out', 'be', 'left', 'unresolved', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'know', 'not', 'Bardem', 'killed', 'wife', 'was', ""n't"", 'important', 'story', 'feel', 'Coen', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'clue', 'e.g', 'Bardem', 'soles', 'shoes', 'house', 'perhaps', 'checking', 'blood', 'stains', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'anyhow', '.A', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'compared', 'No', 'Country', 'Terminator', 'would', 'agree', 'Country', 'basically', 'suspenseful', 'genre', 'movie', 'man', 'being', 'chased', 'seemingly', 'unstoppable', 'killer', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'repairs', 'Yes', 'acting', 'injections', 'wit', 'cinematography', 'are', 'up', 'usual', 'high', 'Coen', 'standards', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'be', 'exhilarating', 'refreshing', 'particularly', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'good', 'genre', 'movie', 'sadly', 'nothing', 'else']",N/A

Especially ""Fargo"" and ""Mudsucker Proxy"" (I forgot the exact name but I'm too lazy to look it up), and ""Raising Arizona"". I really was happy when the Coens won the Director Oscar but I do feel it was really for their body of work as the real technical film masterpiece (I hate that word! But I use it) was ""There Will Be Blood"" but that was too artsy I guess for the Academy. I'm not saying this film isn't good. It is! But it is very overrated. I was so glad that many other reviewers were honest enough to give a less than ecstatic review praising the film for its ""meaning"". Honestly I found just as much meaning in this film as I did in looking at T.V. static after something happened to my cable some time back (my cable is fine now). The title of the film perfectly fit with the sheriff's character (which the plot should have centered more around) but by the time the movie really answers the question about the title the film just abruptly ends.I thought I would include a little piece I wrote earlier because it said what I overall felt:""I agree with El Lagarto. (Not about NCFOM being the Coens worst film but about the film losing the comedic element that made the Coens films unique). I loved how in Fargo (their best movie IMO and the one they should have won Best Director for) it went from violently tense to funny then back to tense in the same scene (like the kidnapping scene). And the use of the landscape I think was just perfect for the mood. But NCFOM seemed devoid of any of that balance. It focused just on the violent intensity. I agree also that it's a well-crafted movie but the characters were lacking.""On a positive note the acting was good especially from Tommy Lee Jones and the actress who played Josh Brolin's wife. Javier Bardem is a wonderful actor but the acclaim he got for this was really overdoing it. What about praising his roles where he actually played a human being? He should have been nominated and won for ""The Sea Inside"" but that's a whole different story.I would recommend ""No Country for Old Men"" for one watch.

84842,A2EL3990HXOMZB,0788882988,Antonio Robert,"[1, 3]","The Coen brothers' most awarded movie of recent years (including Best Picture Oscar for 2007) expands ranks of their first rate thrillers beginning with ""Blood Simple"" through ""Miller's Crossing"" to ""Fargo"" (all three recommended if you like their crime style). However, ""No Country for Old Men"" is almost verging on existentialism in showing how cruelty and being at wrong place at wrong time influence humans, regardless of what they do or believe in.There is hardly a person now who does not know the gist of the plot, and in fact, the synopsis is not that important. It's enough to know in advance that it's basically about a man finding money ($2 million) who tries to keep it, only to be hunted down by professional killer, who is one step ahead of justice.The film is bookended by narrated entries of sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who remembers the bygone era and has the inner strength to hold its values' flag reasonably high.Despite the graphic violence impersonated by ruthless Anton Chigurh (stunning Javier Bardem in one of the most villain roles ever awarded by Oscar), the Coens did not want every murder on the screen to be shown, let alone drowned in blood, although there may be some fans of their works, who really enjoy this. The comic relief every now and then helps, along with excellent camerawork and tight script, to keep the Coen stamp as vivid as ever.The most discussed point - the ending - just hits home. In fact, exactly the way the movie is claustrophobic, it opens at the end, gets loose, open to more explanations. At least two of them, to be specific. But as we see almost no police in actions and the sheriff limping behind, ... you choose. The movie is at least so generous - it lets you choose. Just like that coin of Anton's.Some argue that No Country offers no hope whatsoever. Arguably they're right. This is not a movie to relish. But it dissects the nature of our world very well.

This is a lean and hard tale rendered in spare and uncompromised terms and it refuses to follow whatever direction you might assume it's going.  Stubbornly original and true to its despairing view, this is challenging film work that disobeys the rules and conventions of the genre that encapsulates it.Dominating the film is Javier Bardem's eerie hired killer as remorseless and unrelenting malevolence personified.  There is a tangible sense of dread whenever he is on screen, which is a good deal of the time, and his detached and bemused lethality is both chilling and the perfect metaphor for the anguish over lost values and decency that is at the heart of the film.  Here is total savagery, ruthlessly walking amongst the sane and the civil, unbridled and uncontrollable and impervious to mitigation, negotiation, reason or mercy.  It is a frightening portrait of the violent insanity of our times.And it is the insanity of our times that overwhelms the other characters we come to know.  Josh Brolin's tough Viet Nam vet, stubbornly trying to reverse his hard luck and bring a bit of ease to his sweet wife, nicely played by Kelly MacDonald , with dirty money chanced-upon.  And even more essentially, Tommy Lee Jones' honest and savvy sheriff, dazed and bewildered by the vanishing values of his West Texas heritage and the seemingly bottomless degrees of violence and degradation that have infiltrated and threaten to subsume the world left him by his lawmen grandfather and father.The film bears all the trademarks of the Coen brothers best works:  a tight and lean script; beautiful and essential cinematography from Roger Deakins; wonderful lead characters and great care in the casting of all supporting parts; occasional dark gallows humor; spare and meticulous dialogue; and artful and judicious depictions of unspeakable violence.  Their great craft is evident throughout.Finally, this is a film that is unrelievedly bleak and despairing in its vision and at its heart.  There are no compromises made and no reassuring answers supplied.  In the long coda that ends the film, does Tommy Lee Jones supply a glimmer of hope that light will be found in the darkness, or is he once again simply offering a sad requiem for the lost simple decencies of our fathers?

84849,A1184B1I5G87YF,0788882988,"Austin ""atticus101""","[2, 3]","There are a few things I've learned about film making in my 27 years on this Earth, one of these being this: The Coen Brothers divide movie fans like oil and water.  Their left field style is something that I love but some people hate.  This can best be shown in their newest film No Country for Old Men, based Cormac McCarthy's book of the same name.The movie is a combo of a chase movie and investigation into the seedy world of drug running.  When hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens across a drug deal gone very wrong, he finds a truck bed full of drugs and $2 million in cash stashed in a satchel.  Seeing wealth staring at him in the face, Llewelyn throws caution and common sense to the wind and takes the money.  This single action makes Llewelyn become the target of multiple parties on both sides of the law.  On the right side is probable AARP member Sherriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his dry sense of humor.  He is a man who knows the world has passed him but continues on with his duty of serving his county's citizens.  Sherriff Bell's doppelganger is Antone Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hitman whose weapons include a shotgun with a stainless steal silencer and a pneumatic steel rod and air tank.  These three men carve a path of doubt, violence, blood, and philosophical problems across the West Texas landscape in hopes of recovering the stolen money.The best way to categorize this movie is to call it a ""non""- or ""anti-"" movie, in other words, a film that doesn't carry a score, traditional acting roles (no real leading actor), and no simplistic story telling.  Really, the viewer here is treated like a invisible 3rd party, dropped into the middle of this world, with no introductions or welcomes, just ""here you are, try not to get shot"" and let loose to learn anything about these characters that we can. We are not given outright or even subtle introductions to the characters the film, we only deduce what we know by the on going story arc and their actions.  This issue alone is enough to scare of the casual movie watcher and drive them down the hall to something silly, like I Am Legend.  Again, the Coen brothers power of divide at work.The best way to describe this movie is to relate it to a philosophy class in college.  The movie, and even the book, is, to their core, a philosophical discussion on justice and life.  The tag line to the movie is ""No one gets away clean"" is really very accurate.  The killing machine Chigurh is almost terminator like in his approach and method at times.  You can look at the both The Terminator and this movies scene of the villains healing themselves after wounds are dealt out by the ""hero"" and see the same cold, precise determination in both characters.  But Chigurh is different from Schwarzenegger's character by thinking, even justifying his actions to himself and the world.  It's easy to say that Chigurh sees himself as an extension of fate on Earth.  He often employs coin flips in deciding victim's fates, and gives his reasoning behind the coin flip during these moments.  Even Chigurh can't exacpe the ripple effects of his actions and is forced to accept a fate that may be worse than death in his profession in the end.The discussions of actions and their consequences is the whole point to this film.  Each party pursuing Llewlyn has their reasons and motives, but we never really know Llewlyn's reasons, other than just pure greed.  He never stops to think about his actions, and even makes a crucial decision to keep the money and keep fighting rather than save lives, to him, the money is his sole purpose for staying in a chase that he cannot escape or win.To a casual viewer, the philosophical waxing done in this film would seem tedious, even silly but really, it serves as a plot device.  The speeches about coin flips and about slaughtering cattle show just how random life can be, but is it truly random, or does it sever a greater purpose?  The fates of all characters in this film are tied into the story, you just have to look harder than you would normally have to, to uncover and understand them.  For those who have not read the book, I recommend it.  It's a great read and will give you more insight into these characters and their situations.

In the city of Palo Alto, they have another saying, but it's not so much a quote as a video that's gone viral over my iRetina, and I haven't quite deciphered it yet, but I believe I'm not going out on a limb by saying it's revolutionary. By the way, in Alabama, a bluetooth is when you've just taken a slug of antifreeze, then you smile and your single remaining tooth looks blue.Which brings me to my point: ""No Country for Old Men"" is nothing but the film-adaptation of a story written by some old geezer cranky about technological advancements ruining his Andy Rooney way of life and if-it-was-good-enough-for-granddad-it's-good-enough-for-me hooey. I mean, the title says it all. The ham-fisted metaphors all but slam you in the forehead like a hamburger-maker. For instance, early in the film, ""Mr. Big City Man"" Anton Chigurh (whose name sounds like a hayseed filled with chewing tobacco asking, ""Ain't ya cheek hair?"" which translates from rural-speak to mean, ""Aren't you a man yet?"") walks out of a cop car he has stolen to kill some clodhopper, carrying an odd-looking, highly advanced weapon straight out of a science-fiction tale. I mean the thing doesn't even need bullets! The most sophisticated thing his victim has on him, in turn, is a safety pin holding up his burlap britches. Later, when Big City shows up at the convenience store, his high-falutin' talk confuses the man behind the counter. In fact, it may very well be that Chigurh just talks too fast for the bumpkin to process in time.Of course, this may just be something like the same situation in reverse: thinly-veiled propaganda for city councils trying to snatch land that has belonged to hard-working families for centuries so they can give the thumbs-up to crooks in crisp slacks slathering at the bit to build more dollar stores and auto malls and basically turn the whole world into asbestos-laden parking lots.That, or this is the zaniest screwball comedy since ""Horse Feathers""!",1,Aren't you a man yet?,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,2210,"['pure-bred', 'NIMBY-pamby', 'town', 'Atherton', 'land', 'motorized', 'spear-studded', 'gates', 'Meg', 'Whitman', 'have', 'saying', 'non-Caucasians', 'allowed', ""'re"", 'use', 'lawnmower', 'dishrag', 'can', 'put', 'leash', 'city', 'Palo', 'Alto', 'have', 'saying', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'quote', 'video', 'gone', 'viral', 'iRetina', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deciphered', 'yet', 'believe', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'out', 'limb', 'saying', 'revolutionary', 'way', 'Alabama', 'bluetooth', 'when', ""'ve"", 'just', 'taken', 'slug', 'antifreeze', 'then', 'smile', 'single', 'remaining', 'tooth', 'looks', 'blue.Which', 'point', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'nothing', 'film-adaptation', 'story', 'written', 'old', 'geezer', 'cranky', 'technological', 'advancements', 'ruining', 'Andy', 'Rooney', 'way', 'life', ""if-it-was-good-enough-for-granddad-it's-good-enough-for-me"", 'hooey', 'mean', 'title', 'ham-fisted', 'metaphors', 'slam', 'forehead', 'hamburger-maker', 'instance', 'early', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'City', 'Man', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'name', 'hayseed', 'filled', 'chewing', 'tobacco', 'asking', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'ya', 'cheek', 'hair', 'rural-speak', 'mean', 'Are', ""n't"", 'man', 'yet', 'cop', 'car', 'stolen', 'kill', 'clodhopper', 'carrying', 'odd-looking', 'highly', 'advanced', 'weapon', 'straight', 'science-fiction', 'tale', 'mean', 'thing', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'bullets', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'thing', 'victim', 'turn', 'safety', 'pin', 'holding', 'up', 'burlap', 'britches', 'Later', 'when', 'Big', 'City', 'up', 'convenience', 'store', 'high-falutin', 'talk', 'man', 'counter', 'fact', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'Chigurh', 'just', 'talks', 'too', 'fast', 'bumpkin', 'process', 'time.Of', 'course', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'something', 'same', 'situation', 'reverse', 'thinly-veiled', 'propaganda', 'city', 'councils', 'trying', 'snatch', 'land', 'belonged', 'hard-working', 'families', 'centuries', 'can', 'give', 'thumbs-up', 'crooks', 'crisp', 'slacks', 'slathering', 'bit', 'build', 'more', 'dollar', 'stores', 'auto', 'malls', 'basically', 'turn', 'whole', 'world', 'asbestos-laden', 'parking', 'lots.That', 'zaniest', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'Horse', 'Feathers']",N/A

The question that readers of criticism have is not ""what happened?"" but ""why should I be interested in finding out what happened?""

Characters are fully realized. By comparison, Fargo is an entertaining movie. No Country For Old Men is a great film.The violence should be noted. There is a lot of it. But the use of violence in this film is frankly beyond reproach. The film makers employ it so adroitly that before long, simply seeing a character check his boots to see if there is blood on them suffices that a death has occurred.

This is because the film is very faithful to the book and would have spoiled the surprises for me. However, there are two very significant events near the end of the film that the book cleared up for me. The film well-deserved the four Academy Awards it won. Josh Brolin was also excellent and perhaps even underrated as Llewelyn Moss. Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald was also amazing, as was her West Texas accent as his wife Carla Jean. Tommy Lee Jones was as always a great pleasure to watch. His character of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell was a much more low-key character, although very significant than his U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard. The character does not offer a chance to participate actively in any of the film's many scenes of action and violence, although the opportunity does present itself on several occasions. Javier Bardem is just stunning as Anton Chigurh, the most chillingly evil film presence since Hannibal Lecter. Even the smallest roles of the supporting cast were well-played. Woody Harrelson is great in a brief appearance as Carson Wells, who is sent to seemingly reel-in or subdue Anton Chigurh, although the film does not offer a very clear explanation of his character or actions. It would seem that the character was sent on a damage control mission. The Academy Award winning cinematography by Roger Deakins presents a great look at the harsh and inhospitable landscape of West Texas. I only wish I had taken the time to see this great film on the big screen. It will stay with you long after you see it. It demands repeat viewings to fully appreciate.

84874,AYTPELF1KWBGC,0788882988,BluesFan,"[6, 8]","I usually disagree with the Academy Awards, which buried this film with Oscars. This time, they got it right.The Coen brothers are part of a small fraternity of serious film-makers who look at the modern world and ponder how we got this way, what does it mean, and where does it all go from here. That they can do so without engaging in any of the host of moralizing 'sins' that are usually part of such films is what separates them from the rest of the pack and puts them in that small fraternity. Their films remind me of Kerouac's notion of petit images - they paint little pictures.Everything you need to know about the storyline is in the editorial reviews above. Add to that that this film is brilliantly made, painstakingly crafted, and filled with stunning performances (Tommy Lee Jones turns in what may be the best performance of his career, and Javier Bardem is a most convincing psychopath; the other performances - Woody Harrelson, Josh Brolin, Kelly Macdonald - are only excellent; the Coens yet again demonstrate that they know how to get the best out of their actors and actresses).Most authors accept that selling their books to be made into films is a part of making a living, and that the result will not stand up to the book itself. This is the exception to that rule. Cormac McCarthy, one of America's finest living authors, should be very proud - the Coen brothers have done his book justice.The Blu-Ray transfer is stunning.

84875,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,0788882988,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 7]","If you're a Coen brothers fan, you're gonna be extremely delighted with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. This is Ethan and Joel at the pinnacle of their directing careers, something that should not be missed by anyone interested in film or entertainment. ForgetFargo. Push asideThe Big Lebowski. Move overO Brother, Where Art Thou?. No Country is leaps and bounds beyond those. In fact, it reigns supreme as 2007's best film.I don't always agree with movie critics but this time they got it right. It is the first time that Associated Press reviewers David Germain and Christy Lemire have both selected the same film as their #1 pick. With more award nominations than you could shake a stick at (including four Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guilds, probably a gaggle of Oscars and many, many, many others), No Country will undeniably have directors, actors and screenwriters jumping up on stage come awards ceremony time.Equal parts thriller, western, crime-drama, and action, No Country weaves a tapestry of excellence throughout its length.The first note of excellence must be directed at Spanish actor Javier Bardem. Probably not very well known to most American audiences, Javier has cemented himself as the leader in portraying a psychopathic killer and (dare I say it!) has surpassed that of Anthony Hopkins in hisSilence of the LambsHannibal Lecter role (something that I thought would never happen). Ruthless, unforgiving, sociopathic, and in desperate need of a new hair style, Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is flawless. Every time he showed up on-screen I felt a chill run through my bones (""Call it""). Absolutely perfect.The next note of excellence must go to Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Llewelyn Moss (Brolin,Planet Terror) is the lucky/unlucky soft-spoken Texas cowpoke/hunter who stumbles across a veritable fortune in drug money only to be relentlessly pursued by killer Anton. Mr. Moss' gradual decline in health (mainly due to wounds inflicted on him by Anton) is painful to watch up until the very end. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones,The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. He doesn't understand all of the death and destruction laid at his feet. He longs for a time when murders were easy to track and solve, not these new-fangled deaths where bullets aren't used (air-guns do just fine) and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their patterns.The fourth (perhaps this should've been first) note of excellence goes to the Coen brothers for their perfect adaption of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name. Many lines of dialogue were lifted verbatim from the novel itself, including the ending monologue by Tommy Lee. It's noteworthy to mention here that the Coen brothers not only directed but wrote the screenplay, too.The final note has to go Cinematographer Roger Deakins (he's worked with the Coen brothers on many occasions and also did the exemplaryJarheadwork).

84883,A26PAN8REXYBYH,0788882988,"Brian M. Ranzoni ""Da Killa B""","[7, 9]","I often find American movies to be triumphs of style over substance. Regardless, our nation produces some of the finest films I've ever seen. *No Country for Old Men* works to weave that finery from cinematography to literary themes. That it ultimately unspools disappoints me. Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name, *No Country* is another quirky Coen crime caper, and still deserves to be seen for those reasons alone.Lone Llewelyn Moss steals drug dollars out in the desert, stoking the wrath of American and Mexican gangs. Meanwhile, rogue assassin Anton Chigurh decides he wants the cash for himself--and no witnesses to trace it...As such, the acting and characterizations are good. Josh Brolin does not move, stand, or talk like the war veteran Moss is supposed to be, yet he impressed me as a schmuck trying to outsmart the system. Kelly MacDonald exudes a likeable personality, without a trace of thick Scottish accent in her West Texas character. Then there's Tommy Lee Jones who, like Morgan Freeman, can be counted on to deliver the wise and world-weary grandfather. The pleasant surprise is, of course, Javier Bardem as the epitome of the enigmatic psycho-killer.I was also amused by all the Schwarzenegger references. Several scenes are cribbed right out of *Predator* and *Commando*, and I am not the first to notice that Chigurh behaves like the Terminator, while Moss channels Kyle Reese right down to his shotgun.But the interesting thing about *No Country* is not the sweeping horizons, the tense action, or the literary themes. I'm struck by all the hallmarks of a bad movie.The film methodically follows Moss as he steals a submachine gun, steals extra ammo, and lugs the weapon around for five minutes before stashing it under his trailer with the stolen cash. The whole sequence shouts ""THIS PROP IS SIGNIFICANT!"" Only, when Moss has to skip town and acquire a gun, the weapon never reappears.In storytelling you don't have a prop unless it has purpose, and the same goes for locations.  About two-thirds in, the film meanders. Moss goes through a bloody struggle to cross the border, only to convalesce in a hospital and run over to El Paso. Chigurh too, wanders redundant; I already know he's on the prowl, so don't waste my time.Only their chase becomes more convoluted as it parades pointless characters.Such as Carson Wells, a bounty hunter who spells out the mystique of the villain. However, the audience already experiences the mystique of the Pneumatic Reaper. And the Deep Thoughts he offers to Wells really applies to Moss and Bell--so Chigurh should have been talking to these central characters instead of wasting breath on a cute cameo.Same goes for cameos by Stephen Root,Beth Grant, and Barry Corbin. This leads me to another hallmark of bad movies, the mishandling of central characters.Sheriff Bell has significant screentime, but his importance amounts to a Greek Chorus; between escapades by other characters, he moseys onscreen to drawl about The Evil That Men Do in Our Modern Times. Then backs off in time for the young'uns to trade buckshot. Bell is the same cynical retiree as Detective Sommerset in the movie *Se7en*, but unlike the latter, Bell doesn't interact with the story so much as flap-jaw homilies with minor participants.Moss's wife, on the other hand, has a major role to play in the story. So it's a shame she's hardly seen, let alone developed. The film pretty much tucks her in the background until the climax. She trots out to a coda that might have meant something if she was involved in the story.That leads me to the greatest sin of *No Country*--the disconnect between plot and theme.Chigurh himself is a well-realized metaphor as the Pneumatic Reaper of Fateful Coin Tossing. Unfortunately, he ""calls it"" with so many minor characters that he never gets around to the central protagonists, Moss or Bell. This leaves Chigurh's theme flapping loose like the tarp on the county morgue truck.Speaking of county, an obvious theme rides with Sheriff Bell and the Cartels. As our societies become wealthy and complex, our fates become more violent and unpredictable. Except Bell takes a comfortable back porch to the plot, while the Mexicans might as well kick back in Red Shirts, they are such generic ethnic fodder. Most of the considerable flash-in-the-pan cast is killed by our villian, but I got that point in Chirgurh's introduction sequence--repeating stylish murder adds bulk to the film without adding substance. The remaining story follows the cat-and-mouse games of Moss and Chigurh. But 3/4 of the way through, it unceremoniously dumps the whole show in favor of Bell's unearned existential angst.Which surely is no reason to pass it over, I reckon. In a lot of ways, *No Country* is a rural version of *Se7en*, in which a jaded old lawman can only watch as Death stalks the idealistic young couple. But *Se7en* was all atmosphere and no useful point. *No Country* makes both without resorting to music video gimmicks, and while it shares the same trendy nihilism with *Se7en*, I didn't find it nearly as oppressive.As Javier Bardem says, ""That's the best I can do for you."" With *No Country for Old Men*, I call it a good thriller. It flies apart at the fundamental seams of character, plot, and theme. But through solid bones and meat, it still stands up to win everything.DVD Notes: Your standard issue release, with a few brief featurettes, no audio or video options, and a crisp transfer. I found some dialogue difficult to hear, while my friend found the featurettes to be excessively bright.

84885,AN3BCEU6Z12IV,0788882988,Brunello,"[0, 1]","I saw the movie first, which is totally superb, and garnered several Oscars. In researching the movie,I found that it stemmed originally from a book by Cormac McCarthy. Sadly, I'd never heard of McCarthy. Reading his biography I discovered that he was the recipient of the MacArthur Genius Award and the Pulitzer and is considered by many to be one of today's greatest living writers. So I picked up the book. Wow! I know that several reviewers haven't been able to get into the wierd punctuation and other McCarthy idiosyncracies, but once you get used to it and perhaps read a bit out loud so that you can understand what he is trying to achieve through the rythym and pace of the uninterruped story, the author's incredibly powerful voice takes over. One of best books I've ever read. Some people have labled it a thriller, but I'm not sure if that is descriptive. Reading McCarthy (or watching the movie) there are many levels of pleasures that you feel from his masterful use of language and regional dialogue that take it so far above the conventional thriller structure that it is simply something else entirely. Some people here are only reviewing this as a conventional thriller, but that isn't what it is. All I know is that I will take the book and the movie from my shelf from time to time to savor a superb writer at the full height of his considerable skills.And the movie stands on its own.  Most adaptations don't deliver the goods in terms of the power of a masterful writer.  This one does.  And I don't think that any actor would have been as well cast as Tommy Lee Jones for the role of the sheriff.  He brings the local West Texas culture to life.So either way. Read the book and then see the movie.  Or see the movie and read the book.

84886,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,0788882988,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 1]","The Coen Brothers have without a doubt created one of the best films of 2007. No Country For Old Men is one of those rare films that pulls its viewers in and makes them think about what they have seen when the film is over.One of the questions I have about the film is into just what genre does it fall. It could be called a thriller, it could be called a modern western it may also fit as extremely dark comedy. The film has some of the best lines I have heard in a film in many years. If I had to place the film in a niche I would call it a reflection on the randomness of violence and its aftermath. The film is also an analysis on the new trends and types of violence that are emerging in modern America.The film follows the arcs of its three main characters. Moss (Josh Brolin) is a welder and Vietnam veteren living in Texas who comes upon a grim crime scene in the desert involving a drug deal gone wrong. Anton Chirgurh (Javier Bardem) is a phychopathic killer after Moss to recover the money found at the crinme scene. Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is an aging lawman who does not understand or like how the world is changing around him.I will not go into details of the plot because this is one of thoses films that must be seen to be truly appreciated. It is enough to know that the Coen Brothers (working from their own adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel) twist the suspense to a level that Hitchcock would have been proud of. The cinematography by Roger Deakins shows off the Texas desrt perfectly.The Bluray disc has very few special features. Included is a 24 minute making of feature and two shorter features dealing with working with the Coen Brothers.This film should not be missed.",5,There Are No Clean Getaways,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,1705,"['Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'doubt', 'created', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2007', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'viewers', 'think', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'when', 'film', 'over.One', 'questions', 'have', 'film', 'just', 'what', 'genre', 'fall', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'thriller', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'modern', 'western', 'may', 'also', 'fit', 'extremely', 'dark', 'comedy', 'film', 'best', 'lines', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'place', 'film', 'niche', 'would', 'call', 'reflection', 'randomness', 'violence', 'aftermath', 'film', 'also', 'analysis', 'new', 'trends', 'types', 'violence', 'are', 'emerging', 'modern', 'America.The', 'film', 'arcs', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'welder', 'Vietnam', 'veteren', 'living', 'Texas', 'who', 'grim', 'crime', 'scene', 'desert', 'involving', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Anton', 'Chirgurh', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'phychopathic', 'killer', 'Moss', 'recover', 'money', 'found', 'crinme', 'scene', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'aging', 'lawman', 'who', 'not', 'understand', 'like', 'how', 'world', 'changing', 'around', 'him.I', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'details', 'plot', 'one', 'thoses', 'films', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'enough', 'know', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'working', 'own', 'adaptation', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'novel', 'twist', 'suspense', 'level', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud', 'cinematography', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'Texas', 'desrt', 'perfectly.The', 'Bluray', 'disc', 'very', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'Included', '24', 'minute', 'making', 'feature', 'two', 'shorter', 'features', 'dealing', 'working', 'Coen', 'Brothers.This', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A
84887,A29PRUAD8RK2WX,0788882988,Buffalohump,"[1, 3]","Let me start out by saying I am a huge fan of both Cormac McCarthy and the Coens, however as a would-be crime writer myself I have to admit I became pretty annoyed with NCFOM the last time I watched it. There are several bizarre plot developments that make no sense at all in the real world. These serve to really sap the believability of the story and take away from the overall experience.Primary among these is the decision by Brolin's character (Lewellyn Moss) to return to the scene of the drug deal shoot-out. This really requires a huge leap of faith from the viewers. Seriously, what person in their right minds, having walked away CLEAN with $2m, would return to the scene to give someone a drink of water? This is just pure freaking craziness. That was a HUGE problem for me. If the guy had dropped something that could ID him and had to return to retrieve it, I would have been much happier. That would make sense! But to just go back for no reason other than to give a really bad guy and a total stranger, who by then is most likely DEAD, a drink of water is a huge mountain to climb. Moss strikes me as a supremely practical kind of guy. Everything he does up to that point is thought through carefully with one aim - to preserve his own hide. So why in hell would he get out of bed in the middle of the night and do something that dumb? In the REAL world he would have been on his way to Vegas with that $2m to party it up with his ill-gotten gains and there is NO WAY he would have gone back there.Secondly, the scene when Tom Bell and the deputy visit the trailer park and discover that Chigurh was just there before them. The Deputy exclaims, 'Oh Sheriff, let me call it in!"" and Bell responds, ""what are you going to tell them? That we are looking for someone who has recently drunk milk?"" And then proceeds to drink from the glass. I just about heaved something through the television at that point. No law enforcement officer in the WORLD would pass up the chance to run that glass for prints and DNA. How does he know at that point that they don't have that guy in the system? Any idiot who watches the Crime channel etc knows that DNA is the number one most effective method for catching bad guys. Even a miniscule amount is enough. When you have someone's mouth just having slobbered all over a glass, that's like a freaking WEALTH of DNA evidence. Even if the guy isnt in the system (quite likely since he's a pro and probably an import) at the very LEAST it might help somewhere down the line in the course of the investigation. So, major faux pas number two!There are several other little details that are glossed over. Like how does Chigurh access his handler's (Stephen Root) office, when there is no access to that floor from the street elevator, as pointed out by Woody Harrelson's character in an earlier scene? How is Moss too dumb to think of transferring the money to another case until its almost too late? And last but not least, it simply ain't possible to silence a shotgun so that you can repeatedly fire silenced rounds through it. Yes, we are used to seeing Hollywood take huge liberties with firearm reality, but seriously, if you have any concept of how a shotgun works, you'd know that's not possible. You can build a temporary silencer for one, but after one shot you'd have to replace it, because it would be blown to s*** by the pellets and or slug.Other than that, this movie is near perfect, but the above bits of BS are major issues for me, and they have definitely coloured my enjoyment of this film.",3,"Great film, if you can suspend your rational mind for two hours",1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,3551,"['Let', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'Coens', 'however', 'would-be', 'crime', 'writer', 'have', 'admit', 'became', 'pretty', 'annoyed', 'NCFOM', 'last', 'time', 'watched', 'are', 'several', 'bizarre', 'plot', 'developments', 'make', 'sense', 'real', 'world', 'serve', 'really', 'sap', 'believability', 'story', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'experience.Primary', 'decision', 'Brolin', 'character', 'Lewellyn', 'Moss', 'return', 'scene', 'drug', 'deal', 'shoot-out', 'really', 'huge', 'leap', 'faith', 'viewers', 'Seriously', 'what', 'person', 'right', 'minds', 'having', 'walked', 'away', 'CLEAN', '2m', 'would', 'return', 'scene', 'give', 'someone', 'drink', 'water', 'just', 'pure', 'freaking', 'craziness', 'was', 'HUGE', 'problem', 'guy', 'had', 'dropped', 'something', 'could', 'ID', 'had', 'return', 'retrieve', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'happier', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'just', 'go', 'back', 'reason', 'other', 'give', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'total', 'stranger', 'who', 'then', 'most', 'likely', 'DEAD', 'drink', 'water', 'huge', 'mountain', 'climb', 'Moss', 'supremely', 'practical', 'kind', 'guy', 'Everything', 'up', 'point', 'thought', 'carefully', 'one', 'aim', 'preserve', 'own', 'hide', 'So', 'why', 'hell', 'would', 'get', 'bed', 'middle', 'night', 'do', 'something', 'dumb', 'REAL', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'Vegas', '2m', 'party', 'up', 'ill-gotten', 'gains', 'WAY', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'there.Secondly', 'scene', 'when', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'deputy', 'trailer', 'park', 'discover', 'Chigurh', 'was', 'just', 'there', 'Deputy', 'Sheriff', 'let', 'call', 'Bell', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'tell', 'are', 'looking', 'someone', 'who', 'recently', 'drunk', 'milk', 'then', 'proceeds', 'drink', 'glass', 'just', 'heaved', 'something', 'television', 'point', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'WORLD', 'would', 'pass', 'up', 'chance', 'run', 'glass', 'prints', 'DNA', 'How', 'know', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'guy', 'system', 'Any', 'idiot', 'who', 'Crime', 'channel', 'etc', 'DNA', 'number', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'method', 'catching', 'bad', 'guys', 'Even', 'miniscule', 'amount', 'enough', 'When', 'have', 'someone', 'mouth', 'just', 'having', 'slobbered', 'glass', 'freaking', 'WEALTH', 'DNA', 'evidence', 'Even', 'guy', 'isnt', 'system', 'quite', 'likely', 'pro', 'probably', 'import', 'very', 'LEAST', 'might', 'help', 'somewhere', 'down', 'line', 'course', 'investigation', 'So', 'major', 'faux', 'pas', 'number', 'two', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'little', 'details', 'are', 'glossed', 'how', 'Chigurh', 'access', 'handler', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'office', 'when', 'access', 'floor', 'street', 'elevator', 'pointed', 'out', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'character', 'earlier', 'scene', 'How', 'Moss', 'too', 'dumb', 'think', 'transferring', 'money', 'case', 'almost', 'too', 'late', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'simply', 'ai', ""n't"", 'possible', 'silence', 'shotgun', 'can', 'repeatedly', 'fire', 'silenced', 'rounds', 'Yes', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'Hollywood', 'take', 'huge', 'liberties', 'firearm', 'reality', 'seriously', 'have', 'concept', 'how', 'shotgun', ""'d"", 'know', 'not', 'possible', 'can', 'build', 'temporary', 'silencer', 'one', 'one', 'shot', ""'d"", 'have', 'replace', 'would', 'be', 'blown', 's***', 'pellets', 'slug.Other', 'movie', 'perfect', 'above', 'bits', 'BS', 'are', 'major', 'issues', 'have', 'definitely', 'coloured', 'enjoyment', 'film']",N/A

84889,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,0788882988,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[6, 10]","I give the Coen Brothers this:  they are never boring.  Love their films or hate them, they have a way of sucking you into their storylines of common folk plagued by bad decisions, bad circumstances, and just plain bad luck. In ""No County for Old Men"", based on the Cormac McCarthy bestseller, the hero, Llewelyn Moss has to contend with all three.  While hunting in the high border country of southwest Texas, Moss runs across a bevy of corpses, apparently killed in a shootout over a drug deal gone bad.  It doesn't take him long to find 2 million dollars intended as payment for the deal, and it takes him even less time to decide that it's a good idea to take the money and run.  Stopping by his ratty trailer house, he hides the money and sends wife, Carla Jean, packing to her cancer-stricken mother's house in Midland.  By this time, the wheels have already started turning towards the film's inevitable conclusion.  The drug dealers want their money back and have sent psychopathic hit man, Anton Chigurh, to fetch the money and eliminate anyone remotely involved in the mess.  At the same time, lawman Ed Tom Bell kisses his wife goodbye and heads out to find who is responsible for the escalating number of deaths in his county.  Both Chigurh and Ed Tom quickly realize that the central figure of their search is Llewelyn Moss, and it is a race against time to see who finds him first.""No Country for Old Men"" returns the Coen Brothers to a harrowing Texas landscape of bloodshed and relentless violence that they last visited 25 years ago in 1983's ""Blood Simple"".  As much as I like the brothers, I never felt that any of their subsequent films matched the chilling complexity and authenticity of ""Blood Simple"" until now.  ""No Country for Old Men"" is, to me, a bookend to ""Blood Simple"", and a worthy contender for the best film of the Coen's career.  ""No Country"" is a practically flawless film, graced by a gorgeous and melancholy cinematography that drifts cloud-like over a vast and lonely country largely populated by tough, wily, and sometimes lawless men whose roles as predator or prey can change with the suddenness of a summer storm.The acting is first-rate with the much-awarded Javier Bardem giving a calm, steady, utterly terrifying performance as the remorseless assassin, Chigurh.  His steely killer is actually the centerpiece of the film and a single-minded foe that will not be deterred from his mission.  He reminded me a little of Schwarzenegger's ""Terminator"", in his steadfast determination to continue his mayhem; despite his own injuries, he seems almost superhuman.  As Llewelyn Moss, Josh Brolin is both foolhardy and courageous--he does wrong and knowingly endangers his family, but he truly believes that he'll somehow be able to pull it off and evade the killer hot on his tail.  Brolin brings a vulnerability and a likability to the Moss character that he wouldn't otherwise have--we root for him, in spite of his reckless behavior.  As Ed Tom Bell, Tommy Lee Jones lends his usual comforting and easygoing presence as a lawman entering an era that doesn't conform to his own experiences and beliefs--he's become an anachronism without knowing it; he still thinks that good will overpower evil, but he's never met anyone like Anton Chigurh before. As Moss's confused and increasingly frustrated wife, Kelly MacDonald is funny and touching--she wants to be with her man but, at the same time, she knows he's gotten into something that's over his head and she isn't sure if either one of them will come out alive.  Also popping up in the film, with brief but effective appearances are Woody Harrelson, as a man  playing one side against the other, with unfortunate results; Tess Harper, as Bell's supportive wife; and Barry Corbin, as Bell's retired lawman uncle, a nearly-dead old relic who, nevertheless, delivers the film's coda in an unexpectedly sage and moving scene.I've heard many people complaining about the ending, but I think it's stays true to what would actually happen in a similar, real-life situation. Real-life endings are rarely neat and tidy and not as happy as most films portray them.  In fact, ""No Country for Old Men"" goes a step further, letting us, the audience, know that it's not an ending at all, that some lives will continue, with all that that implies.I can't think of a better American film that I've seen this year.",5,There Will Be Buckets of Blood....and then some,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,4390,"['give', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'are', 'never', 'boring', 'Love', 'films', 'hate', 'have', 'way', 'sucking', 'storylines', 'common', 'folk', 'plagued', 'bad', 'decisions', 'bad', 'circumstances', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'luck', 'No', 'County', 'Old', 'Men', 'based', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'bestseller', 'hero', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'contend', 'three', 'hunting', 'high', 'border', 'country', 'southwest', 'Texas', 'Moss', 'bevy', 'corpses', 'apparently', 'killed', 'shootout', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'find', '2', 'million', 'dollars', 'intended', 'payment', 'deal', 'even', 'less', 'time', 'decide', 'good', 'idea', 'take', 'money', 'run', 'Stopping', 'ratty', 'trailer', 'house', 'money', 'wife', 'Carla', 'Jean', 'packing', 'cancer-stricken', 'mother', 'house', 'Midland', 'time', 'wheels', 'have', 'already', 'started', 'turning', 'film', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'drug', 'dealers', 'want', 'money', 'back', 'have', 'sent', 'psychopathic', 'hit', 'man', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'fetch', 'money', 'eliminate', 'anyone', 'remotely', 'involved', 'mess', 'same', 'time', 'lawman', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'wife', 'goodbye', 'out', 'find', 'who', 'responsible', 'escalating', 'number', 'deaths', 'county', 'Chigurh', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'quickly', 'realize', 'central', 'figure', 'search', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'race', 'time', 'see', 'who', 'first', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'harrowing', 'Texas', 'landscape', 'bloodshed', 'relentless', 'violence', 'last', 'visited', '25', 'years', 'ago', '1983', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'brothers', 'never', 'felt', 'subsequent', 'films', 'matched', 'chilling', 'complexity', 'authenticity', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'now', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'bookend', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'worthy', 'contender', 'best', 'film', 'Coen', 'career', 'Country', 'practically', 'flawless', 'film', 'graced', 'gorgeous', 'melancholy', 'cinematography', 'cloud-like', 'vast', 'lonely', 'country', 'largely', 'populated', 'tough', 'wily', 'sometimes', 'lawless', 'men', 'roles', 'predator', 'prey', 'can', 'change', 'suddenness', 'summer', 'storm.The', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'much-awarded', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'giving', 'calm', 'steady', 'utterly', 'terrifying', 'performance', 'remorseless', 'assassin', 'Chigurh', 'steely', 'killer', 'actually', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'single-minded', 'foe', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'deterred', 'mission', 'reminded', 'little', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Terminator', 'steadfast', 'determination', 'continue', 'mayhem', 'own', 'injuries', 'almost', 'superhuman', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'foolhardy', 'courageous', 'wrong', 'knowingly', 'endangers', 'family', 'truly', ""'ll"", 'somehow', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'evade', 'killer', 'hot', 'tail', 'Brolin', 'vulnerability', 'likability', 'Moss', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'otherwise', 'have', 'root', 'spite', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'usual', 'comforting', 'easygoing', 'presence', 'lawman', 'entering', 'era', ""n't"", 'conform', 'own', 'experiences', 'beliefs', 'become', 'anachronism', 'knowing', 'still', 'good', 'will', 'overpower', 'evil', 'never', 'met', 'anyone', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'before', 'Moss', 'confused', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'funny', 'touching', 'be', 'man', 'same', 'time', 'gotten', 'something', 'head', ""n't"", 'sure', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'alive', 'Also', 'popping', 'up', 'film', 'brief', 'effective', 'appearances', 'are', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'man', 'playing', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'unfortunate', 'results', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'Bell', 'supportive', 'wife', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'Bell', 'retired', 'lawman', 'uncle', 'nearly-dead', 'old', 'relic', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'film', 'coda', 'unexpectedly', 'sage', 'moving', 'scene.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'people', 'complaining', 'ending', 'think', 'stays', 'true', 'what', 'would', 'actually', 'happen', 'similar', 'real-life', 'situation', 'Real-life', 'endings', 'are', 'rarely', 'neat', 'tidy', 'not', 'as', 'happy', 'most', 'films', 'portray', 'fact', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'step', 'further', 'letting', 'audience', 'know', 'not', 'ending', 'lives', 'will', 'continue', 'implies.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'American', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year']",N/A

84892,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,0788882988,Caleb Williams,"[3, 3]","Before I give my review I first want to say that this film isn't for everybody, it's slow paced and doesn't spell out the plot for you like some of todays films do. The violence is graphic and unflinching and the actors in every role give a 5 star performance. My review will be based on a three part basis, they will be The Plot, The Characters and The Verdict, these should give you a fair overview of the film along with my personal opinion of the movie itself.The Plot: Llewelyn Moss is a disheveled Vietnam veteran who's looking for a break. While out doing his usual deer hunting he stumbles across a massacre site where a drug deal has gone awry and whatever happened at the deal it lead to the death of all men involved. While investigating the site he finds a case filled with $2 Million which he decides to steal the money in the hopes of a better life for him and his wife Carla. He knows that he can't just take the money and live a happy life so he tells Carla to go and live with her parents while he goes away for a while until the dust settles. Little did Llewelyn know the man who arranged the deal was a murderous psychopath called Chigurh, he's a man that is prepared to kill anyone who gets in his way or anyone who loses the flip of a coin. He carries around a cattle gun and a silenced shot gun for which he uses to create chaos and torment to everyone he encounters. This is one of the chases of its own as Llewelyn is always one step ahead of Chigurh but with Chigurh being an ex special-ops has his ex colleague, Wells on his. Sherif Bell is also a man on the trail of Moss but he's always two steps behind the two of them.The Characters: The superb portrayal of every character by every actor in this movie makes it truly superb and something memorable. The characters that stand out the most are that of Moss & Chigurh and I will discuss both these characters in this section.Llewelyn Moss: Played by Josh Brolin is one of those characters that you root for from the very beginning but there's a deep feeling in your stomach that you know the man is doomed. He's a shell of a man who seems to have simply given up on life up until that moment he finds the money, because he's found it and can see the potential in how it can improve the life of him and his wife he's determined to keep the money no matter who's after him.Chigurh: This is obviously the character that the whole movie revolves around, he's the venerable psychopath for whom nobody can explain his motives or his ideas. At the start of the movie we come to see him as simply a guy who likes to kill, then our minds are changed when we see him chasing Moss for the money and then our minds are changed again and we believe he may just like killing. When walking to a destination or when entering someone in conversation, he gives off this soulless chill that I can't really explain but once you watch the movie yourself you'll know what I mean. He's almost Frankenstein like in his movement, he shows no urgency or change in pace, he moves fluidly to the point of which when he bursts through doors and starts executing people you start to think. ""How did he know they were there?"" It's a truly superb performance by the relatively unknown actor Javier Bardem.The Verdict: I have to say at first I didn't understand this film and it became quite confusing. I wasn't sure who was chasing who and I really wasn't sure what the movie was all about, then it became apparent as to the whole story which only really starts to come together around the middle of the film. It baffles me though, that how a man can kill so many people in sometimes very brutal and loud ways can still stay a step ahead of the police. It's a great movie and has an intelligence to it that we very rarely see on the screen these days. It doesn't have dramatic explosions and it has no point with which it uses background music in order to add effect, this will have encouraged the actors to give an even better performance and let me tell you it worked superbly. You must buy this movie and enjoy it time after time after time as it really is something great and for the two hour runtime I think we can safely say it's a bit too short.",5,A No Holds Barred Movie,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,4198,"['give', 'review', 'first', 'want', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'everybody', 'slow', 'paced', ""n't"", 'spell', 'out', 'plot', 'like', 'todays', 'films', 'do', 'violence', 'graphic', 'unflinching', 'actors', 'role', 'give', '5', 'star', 'performance', 'My', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'based', 'three', 'part', 'basis', 'will', 'be', 'Plot', 'Characters', 'Verdict', 'should', 'give', 'fair', 'overview', 'film', 'personal', 'opinion', 'movie', 'itself.The', 'Plot', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'disheveled', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'who', 'looking', 'break', 'out', 'doing', 'usual', 'deer', 'hunting', 'massacre', 'site', 'where', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'awry', 'happened', 'deal', 'lead', 'death', 'men', 'involved', 'investigating', 'site', 'case', 'filled', '2', 'Million', 'steal', 'money', 'hopes', 'better', 'life', 'wife', 'Carla', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'money', 'live', 'happy', 'life', 'Carla', 'go', 'live', 'parents', 'away', 'while', 'dust', 'settles', 'Little', 'did', 'Llewelyn', 'know', 'man', 'who', 'arranged', 'deal', 'was', 'murderous', 'psychopath', 'called', 'Chigurh', 'man', 'prepared', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'anyone', 'who', 'flip', 'coin', 'cattle', 'gun', 'silenced', 'shot', 'gun', 'create', 'chaos', 'torment', 'everyone', 'one', 'chases', 'own', 'Llewelyn', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Chigurh', 'Chigurh', 'being', 'ex', 'special-ops', 'ex', 'colleague', 'Wells', 'Sherif', 'Bell', 'also', 'man', 'trail', 'Moss', 'always', 'two', 'steps', 'two', 'them.The', 'Characters', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'character', 'actor', 'movie', 'truly', 'superb', 'something', 'memorable', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'most', 'are', 'Moss', 'Chigurh', 'will', 'discuss', 'characters', 'section.Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Played', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'one', 'characters', 'root', 'very', 'beginning', 'deep', 'feeling', 'stomach', 'know', 'man', 'doomed', 'shell', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'simply', 'given', 'up', 'life', 'up', 'moment', 'money', 'found', 'can', 'see', 'potential', 'how', 'can', 'improve', 'life', 'wife', 'determined', 'keep', 'money', 'matter', 'who', 'him.Chigurh', 'obviously', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'around', 'venerable', 'psychopath', 'whom', 'nobody', 'can', 'explain', 'motives', 'ideas', 'start', 'movie', 'come', 'see', 'as', 'simply', 'guy', 'who', 'kill', 'then', 'minds', 'are', 'changed', 'when', 'see', 'chasing', 'Moss', 'money', 'then', 'minds', 'are', 'changed', 'again', 'believe', 'may', 'just', 'like', 'killing', 'When', 'walking', 'destination', 'when', 'entering', 'someone', 'conversation', 'soulless', 'chill', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'once', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'almost', 'Frankenstein', 'movement', 'urgency', 'change', 'pace', 'fluidly', 'point', 'when', 'doors', 'executing', 'people', 'start', 'think', 'How', 'did', 'know', 'were', 'there', 'truly', 'superb', 'performance', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actor', 'Javier', 'Bardem.The', 'Verdict', 'have', 'say', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'film', 'became', 'quite', 'confusing', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'who', 'was', 'chasing', 'who', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'then', 'became', 'apparent', 'whole', 'story', 'only', 'really', 'come', 'together', 'middle', 'film', 'how', 'man', 'can', 'kill', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'sometimes', 'very', 'brutal', 'loud', 'ways', 'can', 'still', 'stay', 'step', 'ahead', 'police', 'great', 'movie', 'intelligence', 'very', 'rarely', 'see', 'screen', 'days', ""n't"", 'have', 'dramatic', 'explosions', 'point', 'background', 'music', 'order', 'add', 'effect', 'will', 'have', 'encouraged', 'actors', 'give', 'even', 'better', 'performance', 'let', 'tell', 'worked', 'superbly', 'must', 'buy', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'time', 'time', 'time', 'really', 'something', 'great', 'two', 'hour', 'runtime', 'think', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'bit', 'too', 'short']",N/A
84893,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,0788882988,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[1, 10]","A modern day ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". I recall when I was about nineteen and saw ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" I thought wow is this cool or what? I went around smoking the little cigars like Clint Eastwood did for months. If anyone told me it wasn't cool I would have wanted to tell them they didn't know what they were talking about and vote negative for them, so I expect some negative votes here from young boys that enjoy Grand Theft Auto IV as I am not nineteen anymore and I have seen over two thousand movies since. One key difference here is the Good becomes chicken, the Bad lives, and the Ugly dies instead of the Bad. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, but Jarvier Bardem does not show Lee Van Cleef acting skills here any way you stretch it. Since there is to much undue hype about this movie and Bardem's part in it, to fully appreciate this movie there are a few prerequisites:1. You must like homicidal maniac killers with no remorse getting away at the end.2. You have to like the killer doing things like asking for a person to call a coin toss to live or asking questions with no point except for him (This is considered way cool by fans very impressionable by a remorseless role with slick lines of unexplainable cold blooded killer movies)3. You must like that the guy that grabs the money in the beginning (usually considered the hero or at least a likeable character you become attached to) will be killed.4. You have to like innocent people being shot in the head with an airgun just like cattle at a slaughterhouse.5. You have to like that the killer can't act his way out of a wet paper bag but for this movie he will recieve high praise for his dead expression and (see 1, 2, 4).6. You can't expect an obvious sense of humor as in other good Coen movies like ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"". (There may be subtle humor, but almost imperceptible except to fans of the Coen's)If you think I can't take hardcore like this, you are mistaken. I enjoy movies like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Heat"". This isn't on the same level. There is some good acting for certain, but someone having a dead expression and shooting people with an airgun doesn't make it good acting. Josh Brolin was great and I loved Tommy Lee Jones as the sheriff in this movie, and they made it all worth my time. I would love to see Jones as a sheriff like that again in a murder investigation, but where the cold blooded murdering dog gets the chair or for the mamsy pansies lethal injection. However, in this movie I did not like the killer walking away at the end. I wanted Josh or Tommy to root him down a few feet under. I guess what they were creating here was a country version of ""Pulp Fiction"", or ""Natural Born Killers"" so if you enjoyed them, you may like this one as well. In fact Woody Harrelson is even a killer that doesn't get to kill in this one. To bad, he should have killed Jarvier Bardem's character with extreme prejudice since Woody can act. If you want to see a scary killer that can act, watch Tom Noonan in ""Manhunter"" or Anthony Hopkins in ""Silence of the Lambs"". That is unless I missed the point and Jarvier was playing Michael Myers from the Halloween movies. That would make the expressionless facade, indestructable ability, and walking away at the end make sense. This is not to say Jarvier isn't scary, but saying Tony Moran had great acting skills in ""Halloween"" or Bardem does in this movie, is kidding yourself. I am sure even Arnold Schwarzenegger will admit it wasn't real acting he did in ""The Terminator"" since he is so much more talented today. Let's see if Bardem can show off his acting chops in his next movie. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" and ""Love Lies Bleeding"".

The Coen Brothers nail the atmosphere of a modern western. The filming is done in Texas, and if it wasn't for the cars, you would think its a classic western. The sets, everything from the desolate wilderness, to the run down motels, fit in perfectly with an excellent atmosphere.

84902,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,0788882988,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 6]","The powerful novels of Cormac McCarthy may lend themselves to interpretation on film and No Country for Old Men has been successfully translated by the Coen brothers and is a superb work of art in its own right. In an interview in a recent magazine, McCarthy indicated he was pleased with the translation of his novel into a film, saying that the film captured the novel.  The direct, bleak, no frills dialogue that is a characteristic of McCarthy's novels is captured in the dialogue in the film.  Both the novel and the film are disturbing, not only for violent content but also for the philosophical underpinning of the novel and film. As the literary critic Harold Bloom notes, the violence in McCarthy's work is not gratuitous, but plays and essential role in the underlying message and theme of the work. I hope to focus on this underlying philosophy in this review.The story is that of an everyman, a self contained competent American male against forces that are overpowering even for his rugged native ingenuity. Llewelyn Moss, played superbly by Josh Brolin, discovers where a drug deal gone bad has left all parties (both men an dogs) dead on the field, with neither the money or the drugs taken away. He finds 2 million dollars in payoff money and takes it. However, he violates a basic premise, often explored in the novels of John Bowles, that he should follow his instincts and never second guess himself in such a risky situation. Llewelyn is troubled by the cry of a dying Mexican drug dealer for water and so he fills up an empty milk jug and goes back to the scene of the crimes to give he man water. What a mistake this is and what a price he pays.  He is soon pursued by a paid killer, Chigurh, played perfectly by Javier Bardem. He sends his wife to his mother-in-law's home and tries to escape the, and embarks on an escape, leaving his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald) to escape the pursuit of Chigurh.  Because of the string of killings, Chigurh is being tracked by the local sheriff, played by Tommy Lee Jones. The sheriff becomes somewhat of a narrator and commentator upon the events as they unfold. Chigurh is also followed by a hitman, played by Woody Harrelson, who works for one of the criminal parties left empty handed after the desert shoot out.  Much terror follows, making for an intense and suspenseful film that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.But who and what is Chigurh?  Many, in fact the majority, of reviewers see him as a homicidal maniac, as insane, a psychopathic murderer. But he is more than that. He appears in other McCarthy novels as other similar characters. The most obvious is Judge Holden in the frightening novel Blood Meridian. As Harold Bloom points out, this character is also that of Achilles in The Iliad by Homer. He is the embodiment of the dark animalistic homicidal nature of mankind which like tornadoes and earthquakes and hurricanes, is part of nature, is a force of nature, is often unavoidable, and which follows the rules of natural forces and not the rules of man. He also follows the rules of chance rather than the rules of man, as evidenced by his use of a flip of a coin to determine who may live or die.It is the worn-out and wise Sherriff that senses this in his pursuit of the killer Chigurh and his gathering of the endless clues that point to both the brutality and cruelty of Chigurh. The Sherriff has a dialogue with an estranged relative about the death of one of their ancestors, a lawman, who is killed in the line of duty. The comments of the Sherriff and his dialogue with family members and colleagues, reveals his philosophy that this evil force will burn itself out, reach some point of conclusion, and will move away. This is a very different view of how evil should be dealt with in Western, and specifically American culture, where we must fight evil until the bitter end rather than seeing evil as a storm that will one day move on. The strength of the film is absolute fidelity to this philosophy on the nature of evil.With a compelling story, superb acting, penetrating dialogue, and the ability to challenge thoughtful viewer's preconceived notions, this film is excellent.",5,Who or what was Chigurh?

I've never seen a movie capture the sense of real Texans quite like this one.  Tommy Lee Jones plays an excellent Texas sheriff on his way to retirement.  Texans are often a more understated people than the rest of the world realizes, and Jones excellently hashes out that understatement in his role.There are some mistakes to the story.  I'm not certain that there were ATM machines back in the late 70s.  But, the driving force of the story is unrelentingly good.  It reminds me of the great Clint Eastwood classic ""High Plains Drifter"" with a little Godfather mercilessness mixed in.Overall, it is a new classic film and it really stands out from the average shoot 'em up.

Mom""","[0, 2]","We occasionally have the feeling that a Coen brothers film is an elaborate in-joke that they are playing on everyone else but each other - not so with this spare, grim and visually dazzling story. Let me say also that I do not know the book it was based on, and am not particularly a fan of thrillers or choreographed movie violence, but ""No Country for Old Men""  drew me in from the start. The plot is as simple one of those ancient Greek dramas, of hubris and judgment, of human archetypes, of evil, honor and redemption, and black dark humor.Out hunting in the west Texas desert, one blistering hot day in 1980, good ol' boy Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes across the bloody aftermath of a drug deal gone horribly wrong; dead bodies of men and dogs, abandoned cars and guns... and 2 million dollars. Llewellyn, a partly-employed welder and Vietnam veteran, lives in a trailer park with his young wife. Why not take the money? Who would ever know? But it soon appears that someone does know that he has a case full of cash, - and he wants it back and Llewellyn Moss dead. That would be Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem); a sociopath with a faultlessly polite manner, right up until the time he casually executes his victims with a air-driven cattle-killing bolt gun. Following Chigurh is the wry and weary Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and for the rest of the movie, the three of them pursue each other, back and across the border, circling tighter and tighter around each other and the satchel full of money - but almost never appearing in the same frame.Practically nothing that happens in this movie is telegraphed beforehand; there are not even any musical cues. In fact there is hardly any music at all. The violence is curiously understated; sometimes it happens off screen, or is only implied. Mostly we are faced with the aftermath; one of the most unsettling sequences is of Chigurh performing rough surgery upon himself in a cheap hotel room. The sense of place is unerring; yes, this is what west Texas looks like; the desert and the rivers, the little stores next to the gas pumps along the highway, the caf&eacute; and the small-town business block. In fact, they are so little changed that my daughter and I did not realize that the story was set in 1980 until quite a good ways into the movie. Aside from no one using a cell phone, and driving junky old cars, we would never have guessed at all that it was not a contemporary setting.There are only three bonus features: a collection of interviews with the actors and technicians about working with the Coen brothers, a ""Making of "" feature and a close-up called ""Diary of a Country Sheriff"" - all of which run together indistinguishably, but still offer some interesting background to the main feature.",5,As Simple as a Greek Tragedy,1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,2777,"['occasionally', 'have', 'feeling', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film', 'elaborate', 'in-joke', 'are', 'playing', 'everyone', 'else', 'other', 'not', 'so', 'spare', 'grim', 'visually', 'dazzling', 'story', 'Let', 'say', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'am', 'not', 'particularly', 'fan', 'thrillers', 'choreographed', 'movie', 'violence', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'drew', 'start', 'plot', 'as', 'simple', 'one', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'dramas', 'hubris', 'judgment', 'human', 'archetypes', 'evil', 'honor', 'redemption', 'black', 'dark', 'humor.Out', 'hunting', 'west', 'Texas', 'desert', 'one', 'blistering', 'hot', 'day', '1980', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'Llewellyn', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'bloody', 'aftermath', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'dead', 'bodies', 'men', 'dogs', 'abandoned', 'cars', 'guns', '2', 'million', 'dollars', 'Llewellyn', 'partly-employed', 'welder', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'trailer', 'park', 'young', 'wife', 'Why', 'not', 'take', 'money', 'Who', 'would', 'ever', 'know', 'soon', 'someone', 'know', 'case', 'full', 'cash', 'back', 'Llewellyn', 'Moss', 'dead', 'would', 'be', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'sociopath', 'faultlessly', 'polite', 'manner', 'right', 'up', 'time', 'casually', 'victims', 'air-driven', 'cattle-killing', 'bolt', 'gun', 'Following', 'Chigurh', 'wry', 'weary', 'Sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'rest', 'movie', 'three', 'pursue', 'other', 'back', 'border', 'circling', 'tighter', 'tighter', 'around', 'other', 'satchel', 'full', 'money', 'almost', 'never', 'appearing', 'same', 'frame.Practically', 'nothing', 'movie', 'telegraphed', 'beforehand', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'musical', 'cues', 'fact', 'hardly', 'music', 'violence', 'curiously', 'understated', 'screen', 'only', 'implied', 'Mostly', 'are', 'faced', 'aftermath', 'one', 'most', 'unsettling', 'sequences', 'Chigurh', 'performing', 'rough', 'surgery', 'cheap', 'hotel', 'room', 'sense', 'place', 'unerring', 'yes', 'what', 'west', 'Texas', 'desert', 'rivers', 'little', 'stores', 'gas', 'pumps', 'highway', 'caf', 'eacute', 'small-town', 'business', 'block', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'little', 'changed', 'daughter', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'story', 'was', 'set', '1980', 'quite', 'good', 'ways', 'movie', 'Aside', 'one', 'using', 'cell', 'phone', 'driving', 'junky', 'old', 'cars', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'guessed', 'was', 'not', 'contemporary', 'setting.There', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'bonus', 'features', 'collection', 'interviews', 'actors', 'technicians', 'working', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'Making', 'feature', 'close-up', 'called', 'Diary', 'Country', 'Sheriff', 'run', 'together', 'indistinguishably', 'still', 'offer', 'interesting', 'background', 'main', 'feature']",N/A

84910,A3BMOOLZMBTHJV,0788882988,Chris Hilton,"[0, 0]","I put off watching this for quite a while because of the mediocre reviews. I'd read Cormac McCarthy's book and didn't want to be disappointed by the film version. Having now watched the film I'm baffled by the reviews. The novel is bleak, but probably the most accessible of his books. The title really sums it up. Set in 1980s Texas, in the early stages of the cross-border drug trade, the ruthless, often sadistic and pointless violence of the new criminal class has rendered the old fashioned, comparatively decent law enforcers redundant, baffled and powerless. Hence, No Country for Old Men.I was pleasantly surprised by the film. It portrays the events of the book perfectly, almost scene for scene, in all its bleak pointlessness. That is the point! The characterisation and acting are superb; the locations and sets are wonderful. The first hour or so is one of the most convincing and entertaining pieces of cinema I've ever seen. If it then tails off slightly it is the fault of the book rather than the film. McCarthy's outlook is so bleak that nobody ever gets out alive or undamaged - there are no happy endings in this story. The main character has no redeeming qualities, which, for me, was the one weakness of the book.Javier Bardem's character, Chigurh, was a kind of human Terminator who didn't quite `belong' here. Most of the characters in the story were bad or corrupt in some way, their purpose to illustrate the new, ruthless criminality, but they would not go out of their way to hunt and kill people who were not obstructing them, not really anything to do with them. Chigurh did not need to be quite so psychotically determined, killing even those who could not possibly harm him. McCarthy could have made his point without leaving quite so large a trail of dead bodies. That, to me, is his weakness - he sees no chinks of light anywhere - they exist, but he doesn't see them. I also thought Bardem, although brilliant, was miscast. The haircut from hell didn't help.Again, this is the fault of the book. Although the story could have had happier outcomes for some of the characters without detracting from its purpose, the Coens, once they had decided to film it, could hardly have messed with the work of such a prominent writer. They did a brilliant job, retaining a very black humour throughout, although those appalled by the violence may have missed it.

84911,A18G7GG53G2X8A,0788882988,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","The Coen Brothers' ""No Country for Old Men"" is one of those films that can speak volumes in few words, and it successfully moves forward despite going at a snail's pace. This essentially goes against every principle I believe a movie should follow, so in all honesty, I don't know why I enjoyed this film so much. I don't think it has anything to do with the story, which is actually quite simplistic: taking place in 1980, a psychopath searches for a hunter that stole a suitcase full of drug money in the remote deserts of Texas. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the structure, which seems to intentionally forgo a clear beginning, middle, and end. And I know it has nothing to do with the characters, which are crafted so realistically that they don't mesh with cinematic escapism. So what on earth is left? Why did this film work so well?All I can come up with are the numerous scenes of conversation, which are fascinating in both style and speech. At some point or another, every character has something to say. More importantly, every character says what they have to say very well. Take, for example, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a low-key yet murderous madman whose weapon of choice is a pressurized air gun--in a scene early on, he challenges a convenience store owner to a psychological duel, and after flipping a coin, he asks the owner to call it. We immediately get the sense that whichever end is facing up will determine whether or not the owner dies. How this scene ends doesn't matter; what does matter is how it reaches the end. Even the way the characters sound is important, simply because tone says much more than actual words do. Bardem uses a deep, monotone voice that perfectly accentuates Chigurh's methodical, sadistic nature.He channels that brutal energy to find Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who foolishly gets himself involved in the aftermath of a failed drug trade. After wandering into an area littered with bullet-ridden cars, decaying bodies, and a gigantic stash of heroine, he finds and takes a suitcase stuffed with more than $2 million in cash. He soon realizes that he has to be on the run, which goes completely over the head of his young wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), who's caring and approachable but easily confused. She and Moss speak to each other as if they've come to an understanding somewhere along the way: He can do what he wants so long as she doesn't question him too much. This isn't to say that he's an abuser--truth be told, he doesn't even raise his voice to her. It seems to be more a matter of trust, which will be difficult to earn since stealing the money has gotten her involved.As Moss moves from motel to motel with Chigurh in hot pursuit, retired sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) begins investigating the case. Here's a man beaten down by life, unwilling to continue working yet unable to keep himself busy at home. He's weary, lost, and uninspired, at one point saying, ""I always thought when I got older, God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't."" He goes on to say, ""I don't blame Him; if I was Him, I'd have the same opinion about me that He does."" Most movies with dialogue like this tend to make the character's situation obvious, detailing for the audience what exactly brought him or her to that point. No such details are given in the case of ""No Country for Old Men,"" which only made Jones' character that much more fascinating. Bell begins the case with enough drive but soon loses himself to doubt and frustration.And then there's Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), a special agent assigned to find both Chigurh and the missing money. His purpose in the story isn't exactly clear to me: on the one hand, he engages Chigurh in a way that's mesmerizing; on the other hand, his methods and reasoning skills are both mysterious and unrealistic. In other words, I just didn't get this guy. But when I think about the way the rest of the film plays out, it's quite possible that I wasn't supposed to get him. Maybe he was meant to be a counterpoint to the insane Chigurh, another enigmatic character that plays against evil in an intentionally ambiguous way. There's really no knowing when it comes to a Coen Brothers movie.This is especially true of the ending, which isn't even partially explained by the word ""unresolved."" Quite frankly, it's maddeningly unsatisfying, about as anticlimactic as they get. So I once again find myself questioning why I was able to appreciate the film; ""No Country for Old Men"" is definitely wonderful, yet it twists wonderful storytelling techniques into something unrecognizable. This movie is in a league all its own, a crime drama so unique that it can't easily be overlooked. How it achieved this, I have no idea, and I doubt that multiple viewings would make things any clearer for me. I leave it to you to go see it and come up with your own reasons for liking it. This is a big thing for me to say--for all intents and purposes, this is a movie I should have hated.",4,Show Me the Money,1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,5009,"['Coen', 'Brothers', 'No', 'Country',

Some nasty thug(s) who are looking for the money try to make life difficult for the hero.c.  Average schmo either dispenses with all the villains, and/or he escapes to a secret location never to be bothered again.  Then he lives happily ever after, or at least until sequel time when he repeats a,b, and c.With NCfOM, only a and b apply.  We can take c and put it in the proverbial circular file that you open with the little foot lever on the bottom.  What Cormac McCarthy and the Coen Brothers made here is the perfect antithesis to all of these average guy toppling the highly trained assassin(s) action subgenre movies that were especially popular during the 1980s.  I'm not a sadistic person.  I like seeing the good guy win as much as anyone else, but let's be realistic here.  It just does not happen.This is great filmmaking on so many levels, mainly the acting.  Josh Brolin is great as the retired welder/Vietnam veteran Llewellyn Moss who finds $2 million in drug money.  Moss actually knows about guns and he does possess some survival skills, but above his head you almost see a dark cloud that is shaped like the word ""OVERWHELMED"".  When things spiral out of control, he still manages to keep a front of bravado even though he knows deep inside ""how this is going to turn out"" as Anton Chigurh so eloquently puts it.  Kelly MacDonald is also amazing as Llewellyn's feisty wife.  She really has the lower middle class Texas woman act down pat, and she's from Scotland too.  Tommy Lee Jones once again returns to playing dignified roles as the about-to-retire Sheriff Bell.  This is a relief after seeing him waste his talents in wretched movies likeMan of the HouseandBatman Forever.  And finally no review for NCfOM is complete without  mentioning Javier Bardem.  This guy is demonically awesome.  Anton Chigurh is one of the greatest villains I have ever seen.  In addition to being irredeemably evil; he is honest to his own perverse code of ethics, fearless, and scarier than a barrel full of tarantulas.  He can even administer surgery to himself with minimal variation to his facial expressions.As great as the acting is, don't just watch NCfOM for that reason.  This is one of those movies that invites your intelligence instead of insulting it.  The dialoge is sparse and to the point.  There is a complete abscence of meaningless jibber-jabber.  Contrary to the negative comments many reviewers used about the ending of the film, the monologue about dreams is very relevant to what the film is about.  The viewer is expected to (GASP!!!) pay attention.  Even the long shots of the vast Texas prairie convey an atmosphere as to how if such a place is not immune to corruption that is usually reserved for the big cities, then what place is?  This is not a movie to be watched while chatting with your buddies.  It requires your complete undivided attention.Before I sign out, the thing that really strikes me as strange is the core message.  NCfOM sympathizes with people that long for times that they perceived were simpler.  Doesn't this contradict the whole youth-obsessed Hollywood zeitgeist?  Then again, the movie is not a plea for us to return to the ""good old days"".  Instead, it reminds us that they are gone forever and it definitely does not glorify what replaced them.  To try to stem the dark tide by yourself is as one character puts it ""vanity"".One more thing (I bet you're getting tired of me saying that).

84916,A1N4CJO76GFKVG,0788882988,"Clayton Self ""Clayton S""","[1, 7]","Here is one of the best pictures of the year.  Another film alongside ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" where the cinematography will make you sweat.  Examining the opening moments, it's no wonder why.  The shots of a vast, unforgiving landscape accompanied by a voiceover by Tommy Lee Jones, who's voice speaks with experience and wonder, assuring us that this is no country for old men.What can be said about the Coen brother's that has not been said already?  Everyone and their cousin knows they make tremendous films, amongst them ""Fargo"" and the incomparible ""Miller's Crossing.""  With ""No Country,"" they've adapted a grainy, modern western novel into a grainy, contemporary cinema about the nature of men in a world that knows of unspeakable crime, and therefore, no body speaks of it.  Amid all the film's magnificent set pieces, performances and violent swagger, the best thing it has going for it is the screenplay, adapted from the Cormac McCarthy novel, using much of the original text.  Here is rare experience when seeing the film is more exciting than reading the book, because the dialogue, so rich with earnest subtext is spoken by actors who know precisely how to deliver a line and precisely what it means, even when what it means isn't what is said.  Examine the scene at the roadside gas station, much appreciated by Roger Ebert, where Anton Chigurh has a discussion with the attendant.  We know Chigurh would have no qualms about killing the man, we've seen him kill, and as a character later states, would kill this man just for ""inconveniencing"" him.  Attend well to the look Chigurh gives him when he leaves, the way he raises his brow at the man.  We know exactly the reason he gives him this look even when the attendant doesn't.Notice I have mentioned barely anything of the plot.  That would serve little purpose with this film about to hit DVD.  I urge you to go and read the book, and then watch the film, and see for yourself why this is absolutley the best adapted screenplay of the year.  The plot itself is half the fun, or maybe even 40 percent.  I found myself not so much concerned with the plot, but how its moved through by these characters.  The ensemble cast is filled out perfectly with Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Woody Harrelson and the calmly frightening Javier Bardem, speaking with a persian accent that is almost scarier than his amazing tracking ability.  These are actors who know the score, playing characters who either know the score, or are completely clueless about what the score is.  And can someone please tell me why Josh Brolin was overlooked for an Oscar nomination?The Coen's have constructed a film that is intensely satisfying on every aspect.  After two viewings, all the magnificant parts of the film still have not sunk in.  Some may find the violence too gratuitous or the character's too unwholesome, but as the title suggests before you buy the ticket, this is a film about the darkest parts of human nature, winning out over the best parts of it.  For those dissatisfied by the film's ending, I put it to you to contact Mr. McCarthy and suggest a better one.  One could see Cormac McCarthy reflected in the Sheriff Belle role, only someone who has witnessed such senseless crime could write so vividly of it.  Or perhaps not, because the Coen's have long been gifted at dipicting it.",5,Call It...,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,3384,"['Here', 'one', 'best', 'pictures', 'year', 'film', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'where', 'cinematography', 'will', 'make', 'sweat', 'Examining', 'opening', 'moments', 'wonder', 'why', 'shots', 'vast', 'unforgiving', 'landscape', 'accompanied', 'voiceover', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'voice', 'speaks', 'experience', 'wonder', 'assuring', 'country', 'old', 'men.What', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Coen', 'brother', 'not', 'been', 'said', 'already', 'Everyone', 'cousin', 'make', 'tremendous', 'films', 'amongst', 'Fargo', 'incomparible', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'No', 'Country', ""'ve"", 'adapted', 'grainy', 'modern', 'western', 'novel', 'grainy', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'nature', 'men', 'world', 'unspeakable', 'crime', 'therefore', 'body', 'Amid', 'film', 'magnificent', 'set', 'pieces', 'performances', 'violent', 'swagger', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'novel', 'using', 'much', 'original', 'text', 'Here', 'rare', 'experience', 'when', 'seeing', 'film', 'more', 'exciting', 'reading', 'book', 'dialogue', 'rich', 'earnest', 'subtext', 'spoken', 'actors', 'who', 'know', 'precisely', 'how', 'deliver', 'line', 'precisely', 'what', 'even', 'when', 'what', ""n't"", 'what', 'said', 'Examine', 'scene', 'roadside', 'gas', 'station', 'much', 'appreciated', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'where', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'discussion', 'attendant', 'know', 'Chigurh', 'would', 'have', 'qualms', 'killing', 'man', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kill', 'character', 'later', 'states', 'would', 'kill', 'man', 'just', 'inconveniencing', 'Attend', 'well', 'look', 'Chigurh', 'when', 'way', 'brow', 'man', 'know', 'exactly', 'reason', 'look', 'even', 'when', 'attendant', ""doesn't.Notice"", 'have', 'mentioned', 'barely', 'anything', 'plot', 'would', 'serve', 'little', 'purpose', 'film', 'hit', 'DVD', 'urge', 'go', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'why', 'best', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'year', 'plot', 'fun', 'maybe', 'even', '40', 'percent', 'found', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'concerned', 'plot', 'how', 'moved', 'characters', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'filled', 'out', 'perfectly', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'calmly', 'frightening', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'speaking', 'persian', 'accent', 'almost', 'scarier', 'amazing', 'tracking', 'ability', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'know', 'score', 'playing', 'characters', 'who', 'either', 'know', 'score', 'are', 'completely', 'clueless', 'what', 'score', 'can', 'someone', 'please', 'tell', 'why', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'was', 'overlooked', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Coen', 'have', 'constructed', 'film', 'intensely', 'satisfying', 'aspect', 'two', 'viewings', 'magnificant', 'parts', 'film', 'still', 'have', 'not', 'sunk', 'may', 'find', 'violence', 'too', 'gratuitous', 'character', 'too', 'unwholesome', 'title', 'buy', 'ticket', 'film', 'darkest', 'parts', 'human', 'nature', 'winning', 'out', 'best', 'parts', 'dissatisfied', 'film', 'ending', 'put', 'contact', 'Mr.', 'McCarthy', 'suggest', 'better', 'one', 'One', 'could', 'see', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'reflected', 'Sheriff', 'Belle', 'role', 'only', 'someone', 'who', 'witnessed', 'such', 'senseless', 'crime', 'could', 'write', 'so', 'vividly', 'perhaps', 'not', 'Coen', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'gifted', 'dipicting']",N/A
84917,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,0788882988,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","The only time I can remember a film deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar was when Return of the King won but that seemed more like a cumulative work than of the film itself (plus the fact it practically swept the whole night made it boring to watch). Ever since then we've had years where a film should've won or wasn't even nominated and we debate on whether the film is that good or if it was just a slow year. Crash is still a bad movie, most people forgot Chicago and Shakespeare in Love and I don't know anyone who watched the English Patient. No Country for Old Men, the latest winner, is a film where some say it was more than deserved while others thought it was well made but not the best but that's always the case huh?Texan Llewellyn Moss stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad, with one left alive and a bag with around 2 million in it. Against better reason, he returns to give the survivor water but people catch on and are hot on his tail. Notable is Anton Chigurh, a cunning and quite psychopathic man with a silencer-equipped shotgun, a cattle gun and a detachment to his kills and maybe even a bit of pleasure. Trying to save Moss and catch Chigurh is Sheriff Bell who's finding it more harder to be a sheriff when a lot of the old values have seemingly disappeared.Last year, Martin Scorsese's The Departed won the big prize which I felt was more like an award for his whole career rather than the film itself. With the Coen Brothers, they have had a wildly varied career from hits (Fargo, Big Lebowski) to failures (Ladykillers or the decent Intolerable Cruelty) so a lot of people can say No Country is most likely their finest since Fargo or Lebowski but strangely No Country didn't sit well on the second and third viewing. Not that it isn't a finely made film, remarkably restrained and not as showy, but I felt the film didn't improve when I saw it again even though most films do the more you see it.The 3 leads do super jobs playing their roles from 2007's big hitter Josh Brolin who had no less than 4 prominent roles, Tommy Lee Jones and the Award winning Javier Bardem. The latter of whom probably portrays the most evil and chilling villain in some time with intelligence yet a complete resolve to kill all in its way, it's certainly worth the nod as well as the win (though I'm sad Casey Affleck didn't get it for Jesse James). The rest of the cast has Woody Harrelson who is somewhat unneeded and Trainspotting's Kelly McDonald playing Moss' wife.Where the film might be an issue for some is in its ending which is quite unresolved and leaves quite a few questions unanswered and one scene involving a cat lover that I didn't like and it becomes one of those films that becomes well known because of what ending it was rather than how it fitted with the story, even though the book had the same thing. Not that it's a bad ending but it's one where it kind of nags in your mind for its emptiness rather than its emotional impact.Not being entirely familiar with their oeuvre, I'd recommend No Country but then again just because it won doesn't mean everyone will love it.",4,"A movie for all?

84918,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,0788882988,C. Middleton,"[1, 2]","Psychopathy has only been seriously studied since the last half of the 20th century to present day. A psychopath can be non-violent, persuasive, charming, and on the surface seemingly normal. Then, of course, there's the violent type, who will pursue, torture and murder anyone or anything that obstructs them from their focused goal. What the two types have in common, however, is a lack of true emotion and particularly, a conscience. In No Country for Old Men, adapted from the Cormac McCarthy novel, the character of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) portrays the unyielding, unmerciful and ultimately dangerous psychopath with unqualified Realism. This is a film that will either shock you into disbelief or (as in my case) raise that pure terror that lies within us all - and as the novel and film ask, pure evil is among us and is unrelenting.On the surface this film could be categorised as just another bad-guy-good guy film, where, in the end, good triumphs over evil. But the message from the book and film is quite clear on this point: evil moves forward, inexorable and any sort of ""rational"" pleading with them or even an ample description of insanity is close to impossible. The quandary is that insanity by its very nature cannot be explained in rational terms.The plot is a simple one. A drug deal gone wrong; and an outsider comes along and grabs the money and runs. The point is, Llewellyn Moss, (Josh Brolin) is unrelenting as well, but does not really know what or whom he is dealing with. Brolin does an exceptional job in this film - a man with a mission, pursued by true evil.It is unusual for the Coen brothers to adapt a novel to film. However, anyone who has read the novel can see that the film faithfully followed the novel.I love all the Coen Brothers films as they all have an atmosphere, (even in their parody's) of true realism and a special view of the world.A film that deserved all the accolades it duly received.Excellent.",5,Psychopathy portrayed with Ruthlessness & Realism,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,1955,"['Psychopathy', 'only', 'been', 'seriously', 'studied', 'last', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'present', 'day', 'psychopath', 'can', 'be', 'non-violent', 'persuasive', 'charming', 'surface', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'Then', 'course', 'violent', 'type', 'who', 'will', 'pursue', 'torture', 'murder', 'anyone', 'anything', 'focused', 'goal', 'What', 'two', 'types', 'have', 'common', 'however', 'lack', 'true', 'emotion', 'particularly', 'conscience', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'adapted', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'novel', 'character', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'unyielding', 'unmerciful', 'ultimately', 'dangerous', 'psychopath', 'unqualified', 'Realism', 'film', 'will', 'either', 'shock', 'disbelief', 'case', 'raise', 'pure', 'terror', 'novel', 'film', 'ask', 'pure', 'evil', 'unrelenting.On', 'surface', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'categorised', 'just', 'bad-guy-good', 'guy', 'film', 'where', 'end', 'good', 'triumphs', 'evil', 'message', 'book', 'film', 'quite', 'clear', 'point', 'evil', 'moves', 'forward', 'inexorable', 'sort', 'rational', 'pleading', 'even', 'ample', 'description', 'insanity', 'close', 'impossible', 'quandary', 'insanity', 'very', 'nature', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'rational', 'terms.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'one', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'outsider', 'along', 'grabs', 'money', 'point', 'Llewellyn', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'unrelenting', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'whom', 'dealing', 'Brolin', 'exceptional', 'job', 'film', 'man', 'mission', 'pursued', 'true', 'evil.It', 'unusual', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'adapt', 'novel', 'film', 'However', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'novel', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'faithfully', 'followed', 'novel.I', 'love', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'films', 'have', 'atmosphere', 'even', 'parody', 'true', 'realism', 'special', 'view', 'world.A', 'film', 'deserved', 'accolades', 'duly', 'received.Excellent']",N/A

In this case, I just want to submit my opinion.This movie is clearly an expression of nihilism, a philosophical position which argues that life essentially has no objective meaning, truth, purpose, or hope, and so everything is meaningless or pointless. I found sitting through this movie pointless and a waste of time and money. Unfortunately, since the way this film is crafted, I had to wait to the very end to learn this.Why is a film, which takes considerable time to develop, then rendered meaningless by its pointless ending, considered great? Why is this not instead considered irresponsible and unimaginative? I think it actually reflects a type of deception that ""the Academy"" proclaimed this best picture of the year. This movie is simply a very violent expression of nihilism dressed up in a cloak of competent film-making ability and acting. One would not tolerate this kind of pointlessness in other areas of one's life. I think that meaning should be a serious criteria in judging films, but it appears to be out of vogue.There were better performances in other movies, with better film making, and with far more meaning.

When I saw it on a movie channel recently I thought they cut off the end so they could run HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER on time. Only later did I find that what I'd seen was, in fact, the end...as if the production had simply run out of film and money. Then I learned it was a Cohen Brothers film and I've yet to see a satisfying film by them. They have talent, just no perceivable attention span. That said, the movie was enormously entertaining while it lasted. I hope some day someone will finish the story. The least the evil cartel hit man could have done is kill the two kids at the end. They did, after all, see him.The movie was cast very well, the script was extraordinary, the acting first rate. The direction was mostly excellent EXCEPT that most seasoned cops wouldn't have stood in an empty doorway holding a gun and facing into a darkened hotel room, perfectly backlit, like the sheriff did in the end. And most seasoned sheriffs probably would have had the milk bottle checked for prints before pouring himself some milk from the same bottle. Finally, most seasoned professional assassins wouldn't leave their fingerprints spread so promiscuously around the places our bad guy (&#34;Sugar&#34;) did while he was looking for the money. Still, what do a couple of young Yankee Jewish kids know about such things? That was a nice shot of Tommy Lee Jones standing silhouetted against the lights outside, his handgun held at the ready. (Had anyone been in that darkened room with a gun...even a .22LR pistol...the last thing Tommy Lee would have seen was the muzzleflashes before the bullets slammed into his body.

84923,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,0788882988,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[4, 6]","*Beware of spoilers within*I was highly skeptical of this film ever since I heard of the infamous pre-Oscar buzz, because pretty much any movie today that wins any Oscar is mostly due to political reasons and not so much its quality. Well I'm glad to say that this wasn't one of them, I was pleasantly surprised.The movie starts out with Josh Brolin's character going out into the Texas desert where he stumbles upon this drug deal that's gone terribly wrong. He finds a large stash of cash which he takes, as well as a few guns that are laying around. After this he goes straight home and we find out that he's a simple man who's down on his luck, doesn't have a job and he lives in a trailer home with his wife, so naturally this find was of considerable boost to his otherwise destitute life. From here on out is where his life begins unravelling, unfortunately, as he goes on the run from the hired gun who's out to collect what belongs to the Mexican drug cartel.What struck me about this film were the performances, first and foremost, particularly fom Javier Bardem who really shined in his role as the evil antagonist Anton Chigurh, he truly steals the show. Josh Brolin does a great job as the unlikely hero Llewelyn Moss, and together him and Javier really cement this film as a tour de force show between the every man vs. great evil, kind of an epic struggle on a minor scale. As soon as Chigurh is introduced, there's no mistaking what he's all about and what he's capable of. He is very cold, mechanical and highly efficient at what he does, yet he lives his life by a set of seemingly arbitrary yet unbending principles revolving around destiny. Chigurh is so incredibly evil, it bothered me far more than any 'Saw' type movie and its ilk. He just oozes the essence of darkness, he is evil personified. The only one that compares would be Hannibal Lecter from 'Silence of the Lambs', and that says quite a bit. He deserved the Oscar for that role, hands down. Even though he's evil, there's a certain kind of respect that he commands, because he's so good at what he does, because of his discipline and dedication, that makes him quite intriguing, which made me wonder about his past and what caused him to be this way. I rooted for Moss the entire film, but I couldn't help being fascinated by this methodic killer on his trail, which made the experience a very haunting and intense ride from beginning to end.The supporting cast is good too, with solid performances from Woody Harrelson as another mercenary, Barry Corbin as the sheriff's dad and Tommy Lee Jones as the sheriff who's hunting both Moss and Chigurh. Despite its theme and related genre, the movie actually works as a humanistic one as well, a look into human nature and our failings, how we too easily succumb to our frailties.What I liked about this movie is that its cleverness lies in its subtleties, it doesn't clobber people over the head with its messages like some other, supposed masterpieces do. I'm a big believer in less is more, and this movie delivered that in spades, on so many levels.  The Cohen brothers clearly know their art form.This was one of the few movies in which the title plays an extraordinarily large part in the story, it was quite apt and does make one think more about the overall meaning and how it applies to the human race.I'm sure there are multiple interpretations to this film, but for me it all came home in the final scene where sheriff Ed Tom Bell hangs up his belt and talks about why he can't do it anymore. He's an old man, and he's quitting because he can't take the pain and misery that he sees on a day to day basis, he's fed up and it's just too much at this stage in his life. From his point of view, he's living in a country that doesn't have any room for old peace officers, he's an ancient relic and he needs to retire, because he failed in what he set out to do, and that there is no point in going on if evil wins. This reminds me of an old quote by Edmund Burke who once said that, paraphrasing, all it takes for evil to win is for good men to do nothing, which fits this movie to a t. If all the kind, decent people like the sheriff become completely apathetic or simply give up fighting against evil, then evil WILL conquer the world, so the movie is a message about tenacity and having the will to fight the good fight, to continue no matter what obstacles lie in the road. Sure, sometimes evil will win and get away scott free, but that's not a good enough reason to throw in the towel, one has to keep on duking it out, because if one does not, then we are all doomed for sure.",5,"No Country For Old Men, A Poignant Film",1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,4619,"['*Beware', 'spoilers', 'was', 'highly', 'skeptical', 'film', 'ever', 'heard', 'infamous', 'pre-Oscar', 'buzz', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'today', 'Oscar', 'mostly', 'due', 'political', 'reasons', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'quality', 'Well', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'character', 'going', 'out', 'Texas', 'desert', 'where', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'large', 'stash', 'cash', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'guns', 'are', 'laying', 'around', 'straight', 'home', 'find', 'out', 'simple', 'man', 'who', 'down', 'luck', ""n't"", 'have', 'job', 'trailer', 'home', 'wife', 'so', 'naturally', 'find', 'was', 'considerable', 'boost', 'otherwise', 'destitute', 'life', 'here', 'out', 'where', 'life', 'unravelling', 'unfortunately', 'run', 'hired', 'gun', 'who', 'out', 'collect', 'what', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'cartel.What', 'struck', 'film', 'were', 'performances', 'first', 'foremost', 'particularly', 'fom', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'really', 'shined', 'role', 'evil', 'antagonist', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'truly', 'show', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'great', 'job', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'together', 'Javier', 'really', 'cement', 'film', 'tour', 'force', 'show', 'man', 'vs.', 'great', 'evil', 'kind', 'epic', 'struggle', 'minor', 'scale', 'As', 'soon', 'Chigurh', 'introduced', 'mistaking', 'what', 'what', 'capable', 'very', 'cold', 'mechanical', 'highly', 'efficient', 'what', 'yet', 'life', 'set', 'seemingly', 'arbitrary', 'yet', 'unbending', 'principles', 'revolving', 'around', 'destiny', 'Chigurh', 'so', 'incredibly', 'evil', 'bothered', 'far', 'more', ""'Saw"", 'type', 'movie', 'ilk', 'just', 'essence', 'darkness', 'evil', 'personified', 'only', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', ""'Silence"", 'Lambs', 'quite', 'bit', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'role', 'down', 'Even', 'evil', 'certain', 'kind', 'respect', 'so', 'good', 'what', 'discipline', 'dedication', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'made', 'wonder', 'past', 'what', 'caused', 'be', 'way', 'rooted', 'Moss', 'entire', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'fascinated', 'methodic', 'killer', 'trail', 'made', 'experience', 'very', 'haunting', 'intense', 'ride', 'beginning', 'end.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'too', 'solid', 'performances', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'mercenary', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'sheriff', 'dad', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'sheriff', 'who', 'hunting', 'Moss', 'Chigurh', 'theme', 'related', 'genre', 'movie', 'actually', 'humanistic', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'look', 'human', 'nature', 'failings', 'how', 'too', 'easily', 'frailties.What', 'liked', 'movie', 'cleverness', 'subtleties', ""n't"", 'clobber', 'people', 'head', 'messages', 'other', 'supposed', 'masterpieces', 'do', ""'m"", 'big', 'believer', 'less', 'more', 'movie', 'delivered', 'spades', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'Cohen', 'brothers', 'clearly', 'know', 'art', 'form.This', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'title', 'extraordinarily', 'large', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'quite', 'apt', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'more', 'overall', 'meaning', 'how', 'human', 'race.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'multiple', 'interpretations', 'film', 'came', 'home', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'up', 'belt', 'talks', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anymore', 'old', 'man', 'quitting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'pain', 'misery', 'day', 'day', 'basis', 'fed', 'up', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'stage', 'life', 'point', 'view', 'living', 'country', ""n't"", 'have', 'room', 'old', 'peace', 'officers', 'ancient', 'relic', 'retire', 'failed', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'point', 'going', 'evil', 'wins', 'old', 'quote', 'Edmund', 'Burke', 'who', 'once', 'said', 'paraphrasing', 'evil', 'win', 'good', 'men', 'do', 'nothing', 'movie', 't.', 'kind', 'decent', 'people', 'sheriff', 'become', 'completely', 'apathetic', 'simply', 'give', 'up', 'fighting', 'evil', 'then', 'evil', 'WILL', 'conquer', 'world', 'movie', 'message', 'tenacity', 'having', 'will', 'fight', 'good', 'fight', 'continue', 'matter', 'what', 'lie', 'road', 'Sure', 'sometimes', 'evil', 'will', 'win', 'get', 'away', 'scott', 'free', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'throw', 'towel', 'one', 'keep', 'duking', 'out', 'one', 'not', 'then', 'are', 'doomed', 'sure']",N/A

I am a huge fan of Tommy Lee Jones and enjoy watching him in anything he does; he brings something extra to the screen in every role he portrays and makes it uniquely his own. My only problem regarding him in this particular film is that there wasn't enough of his character.This was my first encounter with Javier Bardem and, I must say, I was totally impressed with his rendering of this dark, sinister, terrifying and totally insane character. His portrayal sent little shivers up my spine and raised the hairs on the back of my neck every time he came on screen. Let me tell ya, this is no small feat as I am an avid fan of Stephen King's writings!I've never been a huge fan of Josh Brolin but was just short of amazed at the performance he gave in ""No Country..""! I would never have thought he could be convincing in such a role, so was pleasantly surprised.As for the over-all rendering of the film itself, I have to say it WAS different... While the drama, suspense and tension was there, it seemed to me that there were a few too many dis-connected scenes when I thought something was going to bring the story together, but never did. The title of this film ""No Country For Old Men"" is totally mis-leading, as it had very little to do with 'old men' and lots to do with a bonified nut-case and questionably half-sane 30-something fellow running around, the latter trying to keep the million dollars he had happened upon, and the former killing with wild abandon anyone who he happend upon. Again, I must say, not enough of Tommy Lee's character.All considered, I'd have to say that this all left me with the feeling that something was missing. Rather dry overall, even with the suspensful and terror-ific scenes. Would I recommend it? Probably not.

I'm a Cormac fan, have read nearly all his books, and No Country remains the most mainstream of his tales, written in a third person objective POV that is indeed cinematic (moreso than it is great literature) and thus it's a shoe-in for a movie.  And what a movie the Coens have made.Rich with location, ideal casting, they've managed to get the most from their actors.  The Amazon reviews, with well over 700, at only 3.5 stars reflects the dichotomy of this movie.  On one hand, Academy Award winning Best Picture.  On the other, a violent epic of a poor Texas county during an era (1980) when drug wars escalate and innocent people pay the price.  It's not Wedding Crashers, that must is certain.I believe that, as movies go, this one will age well.  I think that it'll be like certain AFI 100 top movies--Sunset Boulevard and Wizard of Oz come to mind--that are better appreciated by audiences a couple decades after the release.  This is, as opposed to, movies like Taxi Driver, that lose luster in repeated watching over many decades.  The key to No Country is the direction, the scenes, the vivid make-up and costumes for what is a period piece that stretches the boundaries of typical cinema.  The Academy voters get credit for seeing this appeal to No Country, although 2007 was a year with thin pickings for movies (as exemplified by the other best film nominees: Juno, Atonement, Michael Clayton, There Will Be Blood).  The best supporting actor to Bardem, and the best director to Ethan and Joel are deserved.Buy a copy of this disc to savor over the years ahead, and the acting and setting and filmmaking will shine through as the public will see past the gore.

84926,A39AWL2FKWDFK6,0788882988,Cory D. Slipman,"[1, 4]","Using panoramic Texas and New Mexico scenery as a backdrop Ethan and Joel Coen fabricated a gripping, outstanding adaptation of Cormac MacCarthy's ""No Country for Old Men"".  Commencing with a monologue about the changing times from weary Texas sheriff Ed Tom Bell played by a craggy and ancient looking Tommy Lee Jones, the film quickly propels into the main storyline.Retired welder and ex-Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss played by Josh Brolin is out in the desert near the Mexican border, hunting proghorn.  Tracking a wounded animal he comes across a charnel among a convoy of vehicles, a drug deal gone bad with dead bodies and a huge cache of drugs.  He also finds a satchel packed with about 2 million in cash which he is determined to keep.  Almost immediately he is pursued by a monstrous psychopathic killer hired to recover the loot named Anton Chigurh played terrifyingly by Javier Bardem.We first meet a handcuffed Chigurh as he is strangling the deputy who had the misfortune of arresting him, at the police station.  He recovers his possesions, namely a captive bolt pistol or cattlegun, which he uses to kill anyone that gets in his way as he goes rampaging through the countryside.Meanwhile sheriff Bell gets wind of what happened and is trying to get to Moss to protect him by recruiting his wife Carla Jean played by Kelly MacDonald.  Chigurh, however using a transponder hidden in the money is pursuing Brolin through Texas and into Mexico.  The rightful owners of the money also hire bounty hunter and former partner of Chigurh, Carson Wells played comedically by Woody Harrelson.What we have is essentially is a film where everyone is chasing someone or something leaving behind a trail of violence in the wake.The character developement courtesy of the talented Coen's is first rate creating a dichotomy on either side of the spectrum of drugs and violence.  The tired, ready to retire Bell played so effortlessly by Jones can't survive anymore in a word populated by soulless killing machines like Bardem.The truncated ending which may be disturbing at some level leaves open a plethora of possibilities for the analysis of this thought provoking flick.",5,A Coen brothers gem,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,2170,"['Using', 'panoramic', 'Texas', 'New', 'Mexico', 'scenery', 'backdrop', 'Ethan', 'Joel', 'Coen', 'fabricated', 'gripping', 'outstanding', 'adaptation', 'Cormac', 'MacCarthy', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Commencing', 'monologue', 'changing', 'times', 'weary', 'Texas', 'sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'played', 'craggy', 'ancient', 'looking', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'film', 'quickly', 'main', 'storyline.Retired', 'welder', 'ex-Vietnam', 'vet', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'played', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'out', 'desert', 'Mexican', 'border', 'hunting', 'proghorn', 'Tracking', 'wounded', 'animal', 'charnel', 'convoy', 'vehicles', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', 'dead', 'bodies', 'huge', 'cache', 'drugs', 'also', 'satchel', 'packed', 'about', '2', 'million', 'cash', 'determined', 'keep', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'pursued', 'monstrous', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'hired', 'recover', 'loot', 'named', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'played', 'terrifyingly', 'Javier', 'Bardem.We', 'first', 'handcuffed', 'Chigurh', 'strangling', 'deputy', 'who', 'had', 'misfortune', 'arresting', 'police', 'station', 'possesions', 'namely', 'captive', 'bolt', 'pistol', 'cattlegun', 'kill', 'anyone', 'way', 'rampaging', 'countryside.Meanwhile', 'sheriff', 'Bell', 'wind', 'what', 'happened', 'trying', 'get', 'Moss', 'protect', 'recruiting', 'wife', 'Carla', 'Jean', 'played', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'Chigurh', 'however', 'using', 'transponder', 'hidden', 'money', 'pursuing', 'Brolin', 'Texas', 'Mexico', 'rightful', 'owners', 'money', 'also', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'former', 'partner', 'Chigurh', 'Carson', 'Wells', 'played', 'comedically', 'Woody', 'Harrelson.What', 'have', 'essentially', 'film', 'where', 'everyone', 'chasing', 'someone', 'something', 'leaving', 'trail', 'violence', 'wake.The', 'character', 'developement', 'courtesy', 'talented', 'Coen', 'first', 'rate', 'creating', 'dichotomy', 'side', 'spectrum', 'drugs', 'violence', 'tired', 'ready', 'retire', 'Bell', 'played', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'Jones', 'ca', ""n't"", 'survive', 'anymore', 'word', 'populated', 'soulless', 'killing', 'machines', 'Bardem.The', 'truncated', 'ending', 'may', 'be', 'disturbing', 'level', 'open', 'plethora', 'possibilities', 'analysis', 'thought', 'provoking', 'flick']",N/A
84927,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,0788882988,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 10]","The film, as shown above, is often called a thriller or Gothic, but neither term really applies. It's not Gothic because it is too tied to the earthen landscape, and it's barely a thriller, because, well, it's so predictable. It's simply a monster movie- a bit more realistic than the Hannibal Lecter/Freddy Krueger sort, but not much. One wonders what the film would have been like if the assassin Chigurh had been more like the hitman character played by Forest Whitaker in Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai, Jim Jarmusch's underrated film about an assassin, which is also one of the most realistic depictions of organized crime on film. R, perhaps he could be more erratically real, like Johnny Boy, Robert De Niro's psychotic character from Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets, another realistic depiction of organized crime. Instead, what does Chigurh offer besides The Terminator and The Joker? Yes, another Batman foe, Two-Face's obsession with coin flipping to decide whether or not he commits murder. Perhaps in his construction of the novel, McCarthy thought that this device was somehow deep or profound, that it lent Chigurh the status of cosmic force of nature, but what it really did was explicitly tie the character down to a comic book level realism. And, incidentally, Two-Face was played by Jones in 1995's Batman Forever.But, to get back to the point I raised, the film is SO predictable. Do we not know how Chigurh's victims will end up? Do we not know that he will escape at the end, despite the bone of the car crash tossed in to make it seem like cosmic justice will out? Do we not know Moss is a dead man? That is wife is also a walking corpse? That Sheriff Bell will prove as incompetent as he is apathetic? And, I earlier mentioned the overrated Thomas Paul Anderson film, There Will Be Blood, but since both films so posture themselves on `depth' in dealing with their amoral characters, it's a wonder why so few critics took these films to task for never truly delving into that amorality. Great, amoral characters- see Films, Slasher (20th Century). Yawn. Yet, of the two films, and even laden with its own considerable flaws, it still has some occasionally interesting moments wrought by the acting abilities of Daniel Day-Lewis (although that film's lead character is not amongst his best). Is there a single character in this film with a fifth of the complexity of Lewis's Daniel Plainview, even considering how thin that character is developed? No. Simple. No. And that is the same answer to give to the query over whether this film is worth rewatching.On to the DVD features. There are three disks- one to download a digital copy onto one's PC (thanks, I'll pass), then the disk with the film. Unfortunately, it lacks an audio commentary. One of the prime things a DVD has in its favor, as a mode of visual art, is the ability to feature commentaries on films, and barring a Woody Allen-like decision yo always forego such, it is incumbent upon DVD companies to include such, especially to supplement mediocre films like this. The disk also has a good making of featurette, a film on working with the Coen Brothers, and a small piece on Tommy Lee Jones' character. The final disk has a bevy of features: a tongue in cheek featurette shot by Josh Brolin, and a slew of clips regarding the promotion of the film over several months- from interviews to book store appearances to radio interviews. All in all, a decent bonus features package. But, the lack of audio commentary is glaring.As for the film itself, on the technical side, the cinematography by Roger Deakins is solid to good. At times the views of West Texas are very Antonionian, whereas, at others, little is made of perspective, framing, and editing. Carter Burwell's scoring leaves no impression, one way or the other. The acting is rather pedestrian- from the stilted Bardem to the so laid back he's barely acting Jones to the solid Brolin. And, as I opened this essay by stating, some things are better excerpted. This film's trailer is proof, for it is engaging, unlike the film. The last 15 or so minutes of the film, after Moss's death, are utterly superfluous, for they add nothing to the plot, which is the primum mobile of the film. The film would have been much better had its rather incisive portrayals of small town Texans and their quirks been given more screen time, and then a reduced scenario of the drug chase, with more realistic characters, were added to that brew. But, alack, this might require work, and thought, and too often, in Hollywood (including the vaunted Coen Brothers) these sorts of things simply cannot be bothered with. Instead, the small time characters flit in and out of this film with such rapidity that they are lucky that a few of them rise above stereotypes. Fair enough, I guess, if you consider film a business first. I consider it an art first, so be equally fair and give the Coens the same in return as they gave to their screenplay: don't bother with their film. After all, your time and money are as precious as any film investor's.

84929,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,0788882988,Craig Connell,"[1, 2]","This movie reminded me of the Coen Brothers' first film, ""Blood Simple"" (1984). with its understated but quirky and violent characters, odd dialog and sudden brutality. It's an odd crime film, but that what's the Coen Brothers usually deliver us: odd and entertaining movies. Whether it's the ""Best Picture Of The Year,"" I question, but I did find it fascinating. I liked it even more the second time.Many times the villain is the most interesting character in a movie, and I'd have to say that's the case here, too. Javier Bardem, a Spanish actor, plays ""Anton Chigurh"" and this guy is one strange dude, with an even-stranger weapon. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are almost as intriguing. Brolin is ""Llewelyn Moss,"" a guy out hunting one day and finds dirty money at a bloody crime scene, takes it, and is on the run from the crooks who own it. Jones is the local sheriff, ""Ed Tom Bell,"" who actually tries to help Moss by grabbing him before the killers do. Ed Tom admits times sure have changed and deranged killers like ""Anton"" are totally unexplainable. To me, Jones is always a great actor to watch.The supporting actors in here are all good, too, and also quirky....just like the Coens like them (see ""Fargo"" for a good example).Another star of this film is cinematographer Roger Deakins, one of the best - if not the best - in the business. His work here really looks spectacular when viewed on Blu-Ray. This is one of the best Blu-Ray transfer I've seen.To me, though, the highlight of this film was the dialog. Man, there were some strange sentences uttered in here with some odd grammar and expressions thrown in. Early on, I put on the English subtitles so I wouldn't miss any of it, or misinterpret what everyone said. In other words, this was not only a fun movie to watch, but to hear. It was very suspenseful most of the way as this turns out to be a long cat-and-mouse chase story. That's usually entertaining to watch, and this is no exception.Are there flaws in here?

84930,AUHG8KSHI529U,0788882988,Craig Matteson,"[1, 3]","I have not read the Cormac McCarthy novel on which this movie is based, so I can't use that to assess the movie.  In any case, two or three hour feature films are necessarily very different than three hundred page novels.This is a very violent film, but the violence is more the fabric of the film than the point of it.  I have to say that when the film ended the way it did, I was somewhat ticked off.  Then, as I thought about the title, the opening narration, and the ending, I was able to see an interpretation of the film where this ending makes a lot of sense.  Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell opens expressing a difficulty with the modern world where crime isn't an aberration, but far too normal.  At one point in the film, Bell has a poignant conversation with an old family friend, Ellis, who is now confined to a wheel chair after being wounded in the line of duty.  They talk about the decadence of the time, and this note is touched on again and again.  While, I could go on for pages about this, I think one point is that law enforcement is meant to clean up the spills and messes that occur in a largely orderly and moral society.  However, when the spills turn into floods of immorality, drugs, murder, greed, and thievery, well, the lawmen of the former age, the old men, realize this is no longer a country in which they can do their old job. In fact, it is a world in which the very idea of law has become an anachronism.The central focus of evil in the film is a character with all the pity, humanity, and warmth of a Great White Shark, Anton Chigurh (a wonderfully chilling portrayal by Javier Bardem).  This creature (hardly a man) moves through society seeking after something as an excuse to prey on humanity as if each person were no more than animals coming to his slaughterhouse.  During the film he is after a couple of million dollars Stephen Root's nameless businessman invested in a drug deal gone bad.  It was first stolen and then found by Llewelyn Moss (well portrayed by Josh Brolin) as he was out hunting for food.  Moss and his wife, Karla Jean (Kelly MacDonald give a very fine performance), are very poor and live in a run down trailer.  Moss thinks he is tougher and more aware of what he needs to do than he really is.  Frankly, he is quite good in the near term tactics of a situation, but can't see the larger forces working around him, and this is where he makes his serious mistakes.So, Sheriff Bell is trying to find Chigurh, becomes aware of Moss and tries to help him and his wife, Roots nameless business man is trying to recover his money, and a group of Mexicans want the money they think is theirs because it is associated with the bad drug deal.  Root hires Carson Wells (nicely done by Woody Harrelson), a bounty hunter, to get his money and stop Chigurh.  Wells is confident, even overconfident, he can do both and is quite talented at what he does.But the plot, and I will leave the rest for you to work out, is really only the thing that ties all the wonderful conversations together.  Short or long, it is the people talking together about all this disaster happening around them that makes the film so worthwhile.  Yes, the film is harsh and grim, but the goodness of Bell and his associates almost redeems things.  I don't share McCarthy's and the Coen Brothers despondent view of the world and, in the end, I reject the film's ethos.  Still, there are many many worse films to see.  It is far better than ""There Will Be Blood"" to compare it to one of its contemporaries.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",4,A very good film with a noxious ethos,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,3577,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'ca', ""n't"", 'use', 'assess', 'movie', 'case', 'two', 'three', 'hour', 'feature', 'films', 'are', 'necessarily', 'very', 'different', 'three', 'hundred', 'page', 'novels.This', 'very', 'violent', 'film', 'violence', 'more', 'fabric', 'film', 'point', 'have', 'say', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'way', 'did', 'was', 'somewhat', 'ticked', 'off', 'Then', 'thought', 'title', 'opening', 'narration', 'ending', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'interpretation', 'film', 'where', 'ending', 'lot', 'sense', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'expressing', 'difficulty', 'modern', 'world', 'where', 'crime', ""n't"", 'aberration', 'far', 'too', 'normal', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Bell', 'poignant', 'conversation', 'old', 'family', 'friend', 'Ellis', 'who', 'now', 'confined', 'wheel', 'chair', 'being', 'wounded', 'line', 'duty', 'talk', 'decadence', 'time', 'note', 'touched', 'again', 'again', 'could', 'go', 'pages', 'think', 'one', 'point', 'law', 'enforcement', 'meant', 'clean', 'up', 'spills', 'messes', 'occur', 'largely', 'orderly', 'moral', 'society', 'However', 'when', 'spills', 'turn', 'floods', 'immorality', 'drugs', 'murder', 'greed', 'thievery', 'well', 'lawmen', 'former', 'age', 'old', 'men', 'realize', 'no', 'longer', 'country', 'can', 'do', 'old', 'job', 'fact', 'world', 'very', 'idea', 'law', 'become', 'anachronism.The', 'central', 'focus', 'evil', 'film', 'character', 'pity', 'humanity', 'warmth', 'Great', 'White', 'Shark', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'wonderfully', 'chilling', 'portrayal', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'creature', 'hardly', 'man', 'society', 'seeking', 'something', 'excuse', 'prey', 'humanity', 'person', 'were', 'more', 'animals', 'coming', 'slaughterhouse', 'film', 'couple', 'million', 'dollars', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'nameless', 'businessman', 'invested', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', 'was', 'first', 'stolen', 'then', 'found', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'was', 'out', 'hunting', 'food', 'Moss', 'wife', 'Karla', 'Jean', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'give', 'very', 'fine', 'performance', 'are', 'very', 'poor', 'live', 'run', 'down', 'trailer', 'Moss', 'tougher', 'more', 'aware', 'what', 'do', 'really', 'Frankly', 'quite', 'good', 'near', 'term', 'tactics', 'situation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'larger', 'forces', 'working', 'where', 'serious', 'mistakes.So', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'trying', 'find', 'Chigurh', 'aware', 'Moss', 'tries', 'help', 'wife', 'Roots', 'nameless', 'business', 'man', 'trying', 'recover', 'money', 'group', 'Mexicans', 'want', 'money', 'think', 'theirs', 'associated', 'bad', 'drug', 'deal', 'Root', 'Carson', 'Wells', 'nicely', 'done', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'get', 'money', 'stop', 'Chigurh', 'Wells', 'confident', 'even', 'overconfident', 'can', 'do', 'quite', 'talented', 'what', 'plot', 'will', 'leave', 'rest', 'work', 'out', 'really', 'only', 'thing', 'wonderful', 'conversations', 'together', 'Short', 'long', 'people', 'talking', 'together', 'disaster', 'happening', 'film', 'so', 'worthwhile', 'Yes', 'film', 'harsh', 'grim', 'goodness', 'Bell', 'associates', 'almost', 'redeems', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'McCarthy', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'despondent', 'view', 'world', 'end', 'reject', 'film', 'ethos', 'Still', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'worse', 'films', 'see', 'far', 'better', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'compare', 'one', 'contemporaries.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",N/A

84933,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,0788882988,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[4, 8]","Starting with the film noir hit, Blood Simple, co-directors and screenwriters, Joel and Ethan Coen have had a productive output of auteur films that range from manic comedies (O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Raising Arizona) to thoughtful crime dramas (Fargo, Millers Crossing). With their latest, No Country for Old Men, they have excelled at personal filmmaking that just misses the mark by not delivering a more pronounced ending.  Under the trappings of a mystery and then chase thriller, this film is an exercise in movie making at its best while taking chances with conventional characters and plot.  It also features splendid performances by Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem.Set in 1980 after the Vietnam War, an aged sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), talks of a long line of lawmen in his family. One day, in the desert a welder named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes upon the remnants of a drug deal gone badly and a case of money and decides to take it.  It turns out that some Mexicans are on his trail and mean business.  So does a mysterious stranger, a clever, psychotic assassin, Anton (Javier Bardem).  And the chase is on with Mexicans, the law, and worst of all, Anton, in pursuit.  Moss sends his wife Carla to her mom's, and he hightails it to an obscure motel.  Apparently a syndicate has hired Anton to get the money and dispatch anyone who gets in the way, but Anton has other ideas and begins to eliminate not just the Mexican competition, but nearly everyone connected with him!  Anton's weapons of choice are a lethal air gun and the largest silencer rifle ever.  He methodically hunts down Moss through detective work and a tracking device.  You know that despite his resourcefulness, Moss is simply overmatched.  Meanwhile, the syndicate hires another hitman, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) to recover the money and eliminate Anton.  All the while, Bell is adding up the clues and the growing trail of bodies to form an ominous picture of what is happening and what is to become.  As much as he tries to help Moss and his wife, he cannot compete with the likes of Anton.  By the end, Bell contemplates retirement knowing a killer is on the loose.Josh Brolin really makes a strong impression as the doomed Moss.  His character reminds one of a younger Kris Kristofferson.  Not since Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs has there been a hideously terrifying character as Bardem's hitman, Anton. His calm, dispassionate killer is surely inspired by past movie villains as the ones in Point Blank and The Terminator.  Yet, in his own strange way, Anton has his code and motivation.  He even gives his potential victims a second chance based on random luck.  And he is most unforgiving if he is crossed.There are a number of well constructed scenes to enjoy including a marvelous one at a convenience store which illustrates Anton's manic state, and a moment in a Mexican hotel that is unbearably tense as Moss is cornered in his room by someone who could be Anton.The cinematography by Roger Deakins (The Shawshank Redemption) is quite effective as it illustrates a desolate, barren landscape in which this cat and mouse game is played out.There are a couple problems with the films narrative, however.  While it is good that the film attempts and mostly succeeds at being unique and offbeat, a few things are confusing like what really happens toward the end at a motel as Moss waits for his wife.  What happens to the money?  Some killings are off screen or suggested, and you have to make assumptions based on the context of a given scene.The abrupt conclusion is a bit baffling; it won't work for most audiences, and even the most ardent cinephile may need to digest the last several minutes to make sense of it.  Pay attention to the film's underlying theme.  Reread the title of the film and understand that it is about the tradition of the lawmen being displaced by a new world order.  Jones does a voice over at the beginning and he concludes it with a melancholy lament and recounting of a disturbing dream.  If only the structure of the film could convey that more clearly, there would have been a better narrative flow to its finale.  Some may call the device brilliant, but it does not work as it may have been intended.  But don't let this slip deny the pleasures of a marvelous ensemble of actors and some great camerawork.

84934,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,0788882988,Cubist,"[3, 7]","After two lackluster efforts - the bland romantic comedy,Intolerable Cruelty (Widescreen Edition)and the unnecessary remake ofThe Ladykillers (Widescreen Edition)- the Coen brothers return to form with a vengeance with No Country for Old Men. Even though it is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy, the subject matter is very familiar territory for the Coens. The story revolves around a bag of money and the desperate quest by several men to acquire it and who are more than willing to kill for it. Sound familiar?Blood Simple (Director's Cut),Fargo (Special Edition)and (rather humourously)The Big Lebowski (Widescreen Collector's Edition)are past Coen brothers films that feature a similar story so it is certainly material that they are drawn to and the results speak for themselves: critically-lauded and the recipient of numerous awards including four Academy Awards.Javier Bardem is chillingly effective as a sociopathic killer who sometimes lets his victims decide their fate with a coin toss. Like other cold-blooded killers in Coen brothers films (the Dane inMiller's Crossing, Charlie Meadows inBarton Fink, and Gaear Grimsrud in Fargo) Chigurh is an enigmatic unstoppable force of nature. In contrast, Sheriff Bell is the film's moral voice of reason and who better than Tommy Lee Jones with his kind, weathered face and equally weathered voice that instantly suggests years of life experience. He conveys the intelligence of his character by the way he works a crime scene, quickly deducing what happens through keen powers of observation much like Marge Gunderson in Fargo. Unlike Marge, however, Bell has seen better days and does not share her optimism. There is a tired sadness in his eyes that says so much about his character.Roger Deakins' superb cinematography perfectly captures the harsh, desolate West Texas landscape and how its vast expanse dwarfs the characters. They are at its mercy as much as they are with each other. The Coens have made a nihilistic thriller reminiscent of ones made in the 1970s.""The Making of No Country for Old Men"" takes a look at how this film came together. Producer Scott Rudin brought the book to the Coens. They liked the cinematic possibilities and how it could be adapted into a genre film that subverts genre. This is a fairly standard featurette but everyone speaks eloquently about the film.""Working with the Coens"" features the cast and crew speaking admiringly of working with the Coen brothers with a lot of their crew having worked with them for years.Finally, there is ""Diary of a Country Sheriff"" which takes a look at Sheriff Bell and how his character is a meditation on aging. He pursues Chigurh but does not understand him or what motivates his actions. The Coens and the cast talk about these two characters and their contrasting takes on life.",5,A Return to Form for the Coen bros.,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,2844,"['two', 'lackluster', 'efforts', 'bland', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'unnecessary', 'remake', 'ofThe', 'Ladykillers', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'return', 'form', 'vengeance', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Even', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'subject', 'matter', 'very', 'familiar', 'territory', 'Coens', 'story', 'around', 'bag', 'money', 'desperate', 'quest', 'several', 'men', 'acquire', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'kill', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Fargo', 'Special', 'Edition', 'rather', 'humourously', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'are', 'past', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'films', 'feature', 'similar', 'story', 'certainly', 'material', 'are', 'drawn', 'results', 'speak', 'critically-lauded', 'recipient', 'numerous', 'awards', 'including', 'four', 'Academy', 'Awards.Javier', 'Bardem', 'chillingly', 'effective', 'sociopathic', 'killer', 'who', 'victims', 'decide', 'fate', 'coin', 'toss', 'other', 'cold-blooded', 'killers', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'films', 'Dane', 'inMiller', 'Crossing', 'Charlie', 'Meadows', 'inBarton', 'Fink', 'Gaear', 'Grimsrud', 'Fargo', 'Chigurh', 'enigmatic', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'nature', 'contrast', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'film', 'moral', 'voice', 'reason', 'who', 'better', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'kind', 'weathered', 'face', 'equally', 'weathered', 'voice', 'instantly', 'years', 'life', 'experience', 'conveys', 'intelligence', 'character', 'way', 'crime', 'scene', 'quickly', 'deducing', 'what', 'keen', 'powers', 'observation', 'much', 'Marge', 'Gunderson', 'Fargo', 'Marge', 'however', 'Bell', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'not', 'share', 'optimism', 'tired', 'sadness', 'eyes', 'so', 'much', 'character.Roger', 'Deakins', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'perfectly', 'harsh', 'desolate', 'West', 'Texas', 'landscape', 'how', 'vast', 'expanse', 'characters', 'are', 'mercy', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'other', 'Coens', 'have', 'made', 'nihilistic', 'thriller', 'reminiscent', 'ones', 'made', '1970s', 'Making', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'look', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'together', 'Producer', 'Scott', 'Rudin', 'brought', 'book', 'Coens', 'liked', 'cinematic', 'possibilities', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'adapted', 'genre', 'film', 'genre', 'fairly', 'standard', 'featurette', 'everyone', 'eloquently', 'film', 'Working', 'Coens', 'cast', 'crew', 'speaking', 'admiringly', 'working', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'lot', 'crew', 'having', 'worked', 'years.Finally', 'Diary', 'Country', 'Sheriff', 'look', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'how', 'character', 'meditation', 'aging', 'Chigurh', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'actions', 'Coens', 'cast', 'talk', 'two', 'characters', 'contrasting', 'life']",N/A

There are so many interesting elements lurking within it that I find it difficult to figure out where to even begin talking about it.  Well, essentially, the film is a study on the nature of evil.  Pure evil.  I'm almost talking about a psychologically unexplainable kind of evil, which Javier Bardem does an absolutely amazing job portraying.  I am an extremely optimistic person and tend to not believe in this sort of pure evil, but works of art such as this tend to make you question yourself a lot.  In other words, this movie will definitely get you thinking.The plot itself seems to not even really matter too much; what matters more are the specific moments of the film.  And man, there are a lot of great moments, which I won't even mention here because I want you to experience them for yourself.  Another thrilling aspect of the movie is just the overall filmmaking itself.  The Coen brothers made so many great choices throughout the entire film that its hard for any real fan of movies to not be amazed.

84943,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,0788882988,DanD,"[111, 168]","You hear the phrase ""daring film-making"" tossed around like a beach ball these days; someone kills off a main character, it's ""daring"" and ""original"" and should be nominated for 20 Oscars.  If you want to know what ""daring film-making"" really is, stick around 'til the end of ""No Country For Old Men.""  Not that you'll have much trouble--you'll be glued to your seat the entire time.  Probably shaking in terror and anticipation.Here's the premise, and I'll sum it up quickly: a man finds a satchel containing 2 million dollars and then hits the road, persued by a psycopathic hitman and a haven't-seen-it-all-yet-apparently sheriff.  If that summary of the plot doesn't suit your purposes, then just go see the movie.  It's not about plot anyways.  The plot is good, the plot is interesting and great...but it's not about plot.It's about acting.  It's about cinemetography.  It's about script.  It's about Josh Brolin putting you on edge and yet getting your sympathy vote; it's about Tommy Lee Jones giving the performance of his career; it's about Javier Bardem creeping you the [bleep] out.  Hell, even Woody Harrelson, in his too-brief role, proves he's more than a funny man.  The main star is, of course, Texas--beautiful, rugged, majestic, and eerily terrifying.  The dialogue is brisk when it needs to be, thoughtful when it's called for, and always engaging.  There are two scenes that rank as the most suspensful I've ever seen: the scene where Brolin's character is sitting in the dark of his hotel room, waiting for Bardem's character to make his move; and the scene where Jones's character enters the hotel room near the end.  Both scenes left me shaking in my seat, sweating, scared and rivetted.  I don't think that's ever happened before--at least not twice in one movie.A word on the ending.  I went to see this with a buddy of mine.  On our way home from the theater, we talked about nothing but the ending of the movie (eventually we got around to ""Cheers"" and began bashing Ted Danson and praising Danny de Vito, but that's neither here nor there).  The plain and simple fact is, it works.  I mentioned ""daring film-making"" at the beginning of this review.  To me, ""daring"" is when a film-maker stays true to the movie, to what needs to be done for the sake of art.  The Coen Brothers, more than anybody else out there, do that; and they have never done it better than with ""No Country For Old Men.""  So casual viewers beware: you may leave the movie feeling unfulfilled, like something is missing.  And you will probably have nightmares afterwards.

84944,AQ990HW13DP08,0788882988,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[0, 1]","Directors Ethan and Joel Coen won four Academy Awards for their disturbing study of the depths of human darkness. At the beginning of the film sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) reflects that he has been the county sheriff since he was twenty-five, and had followed in the footsteps of both his father and grandfather who were law men. But times had changed, and ""the rise of crime you see now, it's hard to take its measure."" The rest of the film demonstrates that point. The simple plot is almost a mere ploy for the Coens's study of human nature-- Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon a pickup full of heroin, slaughtered bodies, and a stash of $2 million. Trying to keep the money was a bad mistake, as the remorseless psychopath and ultra creepy killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) wants it back. But does he kill by choice or by chance? People always object to him, ""you don't have to do this."" He likes to flip a quarter and force his victims to choose. Fate and human freedom loom large for the Coens. The west Texas scenery and the absence of any music add to the suspense. Nor does the film end in any neat and tidy way, only Tommy Lee Jones reflecting on the disturbing dreams he started having after he retired feeling like justice did not prevail.",5,the depths of darkness,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,1265,"['Directors', 'Ethan', 'Joel', 'Coen', 'won', 'four', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'disturbing', 'study', 'depths', 'human', 'darkness', 'beginning', 'film', 'sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'been', 'county', 'sheriff', 'was', 'twenty-five', 'had', 'followed', 'footsteps', 'father', 'grandfather', 'who', 'were', 'law', 'men', 'times', 'had', 'changed', 'rise', 'crime', 'see', 'now', 'hard', 'take', 'measure', 'rest', 'film', 'point', 'simple', 'plot', 'almost', 'mere', 'ploy', 'Coens', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'pickup', 'full', 'heroin', 'slaughtered', 'bodies', 'stash', '2', 'million', 'Trying', 'keep', 'money', 'was', 'bad', 'mistake', 'remorseless', 'psychopath', 'ultra', 'creepy', 'killer', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'back', 'kill', 'choice', 'chance', 'People', 'always', 'object', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'flip', 'quarter', 'force', 'victims', 'choose', 'Fate', 'human', 'freedom', 'loom', 'large', 'Coens', 'west', 'Texas', 'scenery', 'absence', 'music', 'add', 'suspense', 'film', 'end', 'neat', 'tidy', 'way', 'only', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'reflecting', 'disturbing', 'dreams', 'started', 'having', 'retired', 'feeling', 'justice', 'did', 'not', 'prevail']",N/A

84949,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,0788882988,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[38, 106]","""No Country for Old Men"" is for the kind of film fan who remarks, ""Gee, wasn't that murder a clever mise-en-scene?"" and who asks, ""What kind of lens do you think they used in that strangulation shot?""The skeleton of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a cheap, 78-minute, gun-monster-chase B movie. Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, the monster. He is Frankenstein; he is Max Cady from ""Cape Fear;"" he is from your childhood nightmares. He may be death personified.One of many completely implausible scenes: an arresting officer, defying any logic, turns his back on Chigurh. Chigurh, displaying the supple sinuosity of a Cirque du Soleil contortionist, or an orangutan, slips out of his handcuffs. This is done out of camera view, because for Bardem it would be impossible; thus the scene's implausibility. Chigurh then, in real time, strangles the young police officer to death on camera. This is an extended sequence. This is the payoff for ""No Country for Old Men"": watching one human being kill other human beings, in scene after scene after scene, using various weapons, including a captive bolt pistol usually used on livestock. Guess Chigurh couldn't get hold of a Texas chainsaw. This is a slasher flick for the pretentious.Early on, there are well-done, if standard, chase scenes. A man outruns a car: not believable, but fun to watch. A pit bull chases this fleeing man down a whitewater river. The man reloads his gun at the very last moment (of course) and shoots the pit bull dead just as it is about to sink its teeth into the man. Later, in a hotel, a beeping transponder informs the killer where his prey hides. Your pulse may race and you may think that this is all leading up to something interesting. You will be disappointed.Tommy Lee Jones, whose ear lobes appear to be metastasizing as he ages, wanders aimlessly through the film as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, delivering cornpone, homespun, cowboy poet ruminations that are more or less opaque in meaning. No doubt the film's fans are even now feverishly compiling a companion volume that decodes Bell's dreams and conveys their depth.Woody Harrelson, late the bartender of the TV sitcom ""Cheers,"" shows up for a completely pointless half-hour role that yanks the viewer right out of the movie. ""What is Woody Harrelson doing here?""Some years back, some bored English majors decided that conventional narrative structure was not intellectual enuf, and decided to play games with narrative. ""No Country for Old Men"" plays these sorts of games. The viewer is invited to invest time getting to know characters who are eliminated from the plot in ways that convey no meaning and are not moving. The narrative flow is truncated and yet the movie keeps going; viewers ask themselves why the movie is continuing -- sometimes out loud, even in a movie theater --  this is supposed to be a deep, intellectual experience. It is not. It is merely annoying.Other than bratty English major head games, pretty much the entire substance of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a series of murders and tortures committed by Chigurh, who may symbolize your high school's worst bully - a bully so terrifying exactly because he targeted English majors. His victims are often courteous; their likability makes watching them be humiliated and then murdered an uncomfortable, and, given the film's structure, ultimately pointless exercise. Not only are the Coen Brothers torturing their characters, they also torment their ticket-buying audiences.Chigurh's nice victims are often poor, rural, Southern, whites, the kind of people often not featured as positive, lead characters in Hollywood entertainments. They are often villains - witness films like ""Deliverance."" Here they are murder victims. Chigurh is associated with Mexicans, part of a rising ""dismal tide,"" as one Anglo character puts it. No matter how you feel about immigration, you may find this association of Mexicans with a rising tide of evil to be offensive.The film's boosters insist that the movie offers three deep and shocking lessons: life doesn't always follow a neat narrative structure; evil often triumphs; and the old days were more peaceful and, nowadays, things are getting really bad. In truth, everyone walking in to the theater already knows the first two ""lessons."" No one needs the Coen brothers to inform him that life doesn't always follow a neat narrative structure, or that evil often triumphs. We expect filmmakers, and all artists, to offer us a more substantial thesis. As for the third ""lesson,"" that the old days were more peaceful and things are getting really bad today --  have the Coens, or Cormac McCarthy, heard of Attila the Hun, or any number of other less-than-peaceful and courteous personages from our common human past?One might well be dubious about ""No Country""'s ""lessons."" Visit internet discussion boards devoted to this movie, and you will find fans asking, not ""What is fate?"" or ""What is the role of a good man in a bad world?"" but questions like, ""If Hannibal Lector and Anton Chigurh were locked in a room, who would come out alive?"" Given such reflections, one is safe in concluding that the appeal of this film is its emphasis on graphic violence, rather than on any more advanced intellectual or artistic merit.",1,"Despicable

Beautifully shot and brilliantly acted. I've read a couple of Cormac McCarthy's books - the one that this film is based on isn't one of them - and the Coen bros. perfectly capture his pared down, lyrical prose onscreen. Something I never would've thought possible. Much has been written about Javier Bardem's granite faced killer (although in fairness, to describe Anton Chigurh as granite-faced doesn't really do him justice: he looks like he's been hewn out of the side of Mount Rushmore) and its all true, it really is one of the greatest onscreen portrayals of a psychopath that you'll ever see; as convincing as Ben Kingsley's turn inSexy Beastand Brian Cox's turn inManhunter (Restored Director's Cut Divimax Edition), albeit in a completely different way. That said, its really wrong to single out just one performance because the ensemble cast are all note perfect. In fact, what you have here is a synergy of visuals, acting and direction that you rarely see coming out of American cinema in this day and age. I also absolutely adored the complete lack of a score. Its cinema which refuses to concede to the laws of genre or the insidious influence of a marketing demography that has ruined so much western cinema in the last thirty years. I'm not sure that I believe in cinematic perfection, but if I don't, this comes damn close.  Will you get anything out of it? Well, if you can't pick up on the unspoken undertones of threat that can occur in an apparently innocuous conversation between two men discussing the toss of a  coin, then probably not.

84951,A1AUBGENRIZODO,0788882988,Dave Deubler,"[1, 3]","This top-notch action thriller's greatest strength is the pulse-pounding scenes where a psychopathic killer named Chigurh (impressively portrayed by a chillingly calm Javier Bardem) forces ordinary people to look death in the face.  There's plenty of violence, but lots of suspense as well, and some subtle intrigue as well as a not-so-subtle moral message.The plot revolves around Nam-Vet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who finds a suitcase full of money at the site of a drug deal gone bad, and decides to risk taking it.  Chigurh (a nasty little bug with a very troublesome bite) is trying to find him (and the money) and doesn't care who gets in his way.  Meanwhile, a Texas lawman (Tommy Lee Jones) is trying to track down the source of all the bodies that are turning up.  The story rambles here and there, and the directors seem uncertain where to finish the story, so the final minutes are totally unexpected and almost inexplicable, but this is clearly an instant classic of the modern West.Much of the film is a series of chase sequences wherein the ingenious Moss tries to stay one step ahead of the relentless Chigurh, whose calm detachment makes him seem almost inhuman.  Instead of a gun, Chigurh employs a device used to slaughter cattle - an indication of his true mindset.  In an exchange with Moss' wife near the end of the film, he reveals an attachment to his own ideals which could almost be considered admirable.  Unfortunately, his single-minded pursuit of those ideals leaves no room for compromise with the rest of the world, whose fate is of no concern to him.After Moss' trusting mother-in-law unwittingly initiates a bloodbath, the somewhat cryptic ending takes us to Jones and a retired sheriff who discuss how much things have changed since their heyday, making the point that their beloved Texas is no country for old men like themselves.  But given the amount of carnage that we're shown in the few minutes prior, it doesn't seem like it's much of a country for young men, either.  Until all men start to see each other as human beings and not just cattle, the cycle of violence and despair can only continue.",5,An instant classic modern Western,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,2138,"['top-notch', 'action', 'thriller', 'greatest', 'strength', 'pulse-pounding', 'scenes', 'where', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'named', 'Chigurh', 'impressively', 'portrayed', 'chillingly', 'calm', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'ordinary', 'people', 'look', 'death', 'face', 'plenty', 'violence', 'lots', 'suspense', 'well', 'subtle', 'intrigue', 'as', 'well', 'not-so-subtle', 'moral', 'message.The', 'plot', 'Nam-Vet', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'suitcase', 'full', 'money', 'site', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', 'risk', 'taking', 'Chigurh', 'nasty', 'little', 'bug', 'very', 'troublesome', 'bite', 'trying', 'find', 'money', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'way', 'Meanwhile', 'Texas', 'lawman', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'source', 'bodies', 'are', 'turning', 'up', 'story', 'rambles', 'here', 'there', 'directors', 'seem', 'uncertain', 'where', 'finish', 'story', 'final', 'minutes', 'are', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'almost', 'inexplicable', 'clearly', 'instant', 'classic', 'modern', 'West.Much', 'film', 'series', 'chase', 'sequences', 'wherein', 'ingenious', 'Moss', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'relentless', 'Chigurh', 'calm', 'detachment', 'seem', 'almost', 'inhuman', 'Instead', 'gun', 'Chigurh', 'device', 'used', 'slaughter', 'cattle', 'indication', 'true', 'mindset', 'exchange', 'Moss', 'wife', 'end', 'film', 'attachment', 'own', 'ideals', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'considered', 'admirable', 'Unfortunately', 'single-minded', 'pursuit', 'ideals', 'room', 'compromise', 'rest', 'world', 'fate', 'concern', 'him.After', 'Moss', 'trusting', 'mother-in-law', 'unwittingly', 'bloodbath', 'somewhat', 'cryptic', 'ending', 'Jones', 'retired', 'sheriff', 'who', 'how', 'much', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'heyday', 'making', 'point', 'beloved', 'Texas', 'country', 'old', 'men', 'given', 'amount', 'carnage', ""'re"", 'shown', 'few', 'minutes', 'prior', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'country', 'young', 'men', 'either', 'men', 'start', 'see', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'just', 'cattle', 'cycle', 'violence', 'despair', 'can', 'only', 'continue']",N/A
84952,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,0788882988,Davewise,"[2, 4]","This is one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. The Coen brothers do a wonderful job of creating edge-of-your-seat, ready to jump suspense. Watching the movie a second time, I knew what the outcome would be but I was still on edge. The stark atmosphere adds to this effect and brings you into the story. The acting is superb, especially Javier Bardem who won a well-deserved Oscar for his chilling role as evil personified.Josh Brolin plays Llewelyn Moss, a retired welder and Vietnam vet who stumbles upon the remains of a drug deal gone horribly wrong. He comes away with two million dollars which ends up being a lot more trouble than it was worth. One of the men in search of the money is Chigurh (Bardem), who is a psychotic killer with his own sense of morals. He kills people ruthlessly using a rather different weapon much of the time. Llewelyn thinks he can outsmart Chigurh and does his best while trying to keep his wife safe. Attempting to put an end to this cat and mouse game and to save Llewelyn is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), an aging small town Texas sheriff who is unaccustomed to the violence escalating as part of the increasing drug trade.While there is a fair amount of violence in the movie, it isn't gratuitous. There are some humorous moments, such as Wells' assessment of Chigurh and how dangerous he is. Chigurh's manner and expressions, taking enjoyment from his killing, make for one very frightening villain, all the more because he comes across as real. His use of the coin toss for deciding who lives is reminiscent of Two Face from Batman (ironically played by Tommy Lee Jones in one of the movies), but Chigurh is in no way a cartoon.",5,The very definition of intense,1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,1679,"['one', 'most', 'intense', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'creating', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'ready', 'jump', 'suspense', 'Watching', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'knew', 'what', 'outcome', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'still', 'edge', 'stark', 'atmosphere', 'effect', 'story', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'chilling', 'role', 'evil', 'personified.Josh', 'Brolin', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'retired', 'welder', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'who', 'remains', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'away', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'up', 'being', 'lot', 'more', 'trouble', 'was', 'worth', 'One', 'men', 'search', 'money', 'Chigurh', 'Bardem', 'who', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'own', 'sense', 'morals', 'people', 'ruthlessly', 'using', 'rather', 'different', 'weapon', 'much', 'time', 'Llewelyn', 'can', 'outsmart', 'Chigurh', 'best', 'trying', 'keep', 'wife', 'safe', 'Attempting', 'put', 'end', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'save', 'Llewelyn', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'aging', 'small', 'town', 'Texas', 'sheriff', 'who', 'unaccustomed', 'violence', 'escalating', 'part', 'increasing', 'drug', 'trade.While', 'fair', 'amount', 'violence', 'movie', ""n't"", 'gratuitous', 'are', 'humorous', 'moments', 'such', 'Wells', 'assessment', 'Chigurh', 'how', 'dangerous', 'Chigurh', 'manner', 'expressions', 'taking', 'enjoyment', 'killing', 'make', 'one', 'very', 'frightening', 'villain', 'more', 'real', 'use', 'coin', 'toss', 'deciding', 'who', 'reminiscent', 'Two', 'Face', 'Batman', 'ironically', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'one', 'movies', 'Chigurh', 'way', 'cartoon']",N/A

However, neither of us liked Fargo at first and also agreed that No Country for Old Men needs to be seen more than once for a complete appreciation.  The film is beautifully photographed (with New Mexico standing in for Texas) making optimal use of the wide vistas.  The performances, particularly by Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, are superb.  Tommy Lee Jones is the quintessential Western sheriff, coming from a long line of sheriffs, and is still a resourceful lawman but a bit tired as well.  Javier Bardem turns in a remarkable performance as Chigurh, an unstoppable assassin who methodically kills just about everyone who crosses his path.  When he is uncertain about snuffing out someone he will let his decision fall to a coin toss.  There is a scene early in the film when Chigurh offers a coin toss to a clerk; the dialogue is masterly, with Javier Barden being vague in a sinister way and the clerk attempting to understand what is going on, that is an example of the marvelous acting and superb editing of the film.Josh Brolin is perfect as the money-driven Llewelyn Moss.  Mr. Brolin has had a very good year with excellent performances in American Gangster and No Country for Old Men. One minor point that I was wondering about is he really a Vietnam Vet?  Moss appears to be younger than a man who served two tours and the answers he given a border guard about his military service could have information from a father or uncle.  The supporting roles are well cast.  Woody Harrelson has some great scenes as Chigurh former partner who has been given a contract to take him out and Kelly Macdonald is wonderful as Llewelyn's wife who ends up becoming a victim of her husband's greed.I have not read of Cormac McCarthy's novel but understand that the Coen brothers have faithfully followed the book including the unresolved story elements.  One difficulty with No Country for Old Men is that as the story unfolds you might be a bit lost with who some of the characters are.  My wife and I were attempting to identify on what side of the drug deal (gone fatally wrong) some of the characters were on.  We presumed that the business man who given Woody Harrelson his contract for Chigurh was in on the drug deal but his connection is never explained.No Country for Old Men is loaded with suspense and tension.

84960,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,0788882988,David J. Brown,"[5, 8]","Boy, oh boy is this a meal of a film!!!  This is one of those films that has greatness running through its veins.  A greatness that is over-anaylised by its proponents and misinterpreted by its detractors.Firstly, one of the true pleasures of this film is the sense of place it has.  The people, even in bit parts, all feel authentic and lived in.  You never get the sense that anyone has just put on their character's skin, but rather that they are the characters.  The dialogue all feels of a time and place very specific.  It has flavor without feeling overwritten.  Sure, do all people in Texas talk or act like the ones in this film?  I don't know, and neither do you because no one here can speak for an entire region or state.  The bottom line is that it feels specific and authentic as a film.  Like something as fantastical as Star Wars, this film transports you with the details.  Things you may not be concious of at first glance but they seep in as you view.  This is of no surprise to me, the Coen brothers have a nack for that, wheter its Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, or their masterpiece Fargo.The acting is all a top notch example of subtleness.  There's no grandiose speeches or melodramatics.  This is day to day folks reacting wisely and unwisely to circumstances that they never could've expected.  Josh Brolin is sublime in this film.  Even though he doesn't deserve the money, and he puts others in danger to keep it, you do hope that he succeeds, well until his ultimate demon catches up with him.  Tommy Lee Jones is reliable as usual.  He has the hardest part in the film, a tired and apathetic lawmen fighting his own nature, not sure what good is left for him to do in the modern world, at least modern to him.  Javier Bardem is the stand out, he has the most flashy character.  Chigurth(Bardem) at first glance is some sort of super villain straight out of a slasher film, but if you look closely he's much more, and much more fragile.  He has a code, one that may not be understandable to you or even the characters in the film, but its there and he truly believes in it.  The whole film sets him up as an unstoppable force, a representation of true evil, but at the end reveals he's just a man working outside the curve, and he can be stopped by the same circumstances that hurt us everyday and some of the characters in the film.This is a truly brilliant slice of life film wrapped up in thriller packaging.  It starts with the usual money deal gone bad, the wrong guy at the right place which finds him in the wrong place, crime story, but by the end of the second act it reveals its true nature.  It's basically about existentialism and how futile some fights can be, and how its all in the eye of the beholder to answer.There have been many jabbs made here on Amazon regarding the film's violence.  As usual they're over-reactionary in nature.  There are three graphically violent scenes in the film.  They are there in the early parts of the narrative to illustrate the true callowness of the film's villain.  They are brief but they are graphic.  By the end of the film most of the violence happens off screen, hell some major players don't even die on screen.  Sorry.  It's just not that violent.  Goodfellas and Raging Bull were far more violent, as well as Shindler's list for that matter.The main point of the film has been totally misread for only its surface values.  I've read some say that the film was about how the 'good old days' were truly wonderful and how the modern times have become more violent and unbarable for those of the geriatric persuasion.  WRONG.  Tommy Lee Jones is the old man in question in this story and he is clearly shown struggling with a major question regarding HIS own endurance.  'It's a young man's game', may be a quote to help you understand this point.  It's more about how when one gets older the past becomes rosier then it ever actually was.  Just remember your parents talking about how great things were in the 50's and 60's and how kids had respect!!  Really?  What about nuclear war?  Protests?  Vietnam?  Both World Wars?  Hell, the 80's, the time in which this film takes place, seemed like one of the few decades where this country has a small break.  Even all the most notorious serial killers throughout history were around long before the modern and what elderly and pulpit preaching folks would call excessive times.  Someone like the Lee Jones character, a law man who has possibly lived through one or more of above mentioned as well as humans at their lowest due to his profession, has to grapple with that as he contemplates retirement.  Is he giving up?  Is he just accepting the course that every man has to take?  You decide.This film is all about action and reaction.  It's subtle and blunt all at the same time.  Though, some things should seem obvious to even the most dull of viewers.  Just the fact that Josh Brolin's character and Tommy Lee Jones show a lot of similarities.  So does the Chigurth character if you think about it.  Chigurth shares the same pigheadedness the Brolin character does, plus they both have a code.  One thrives and one doesn't.SIDENOTES:There have been some really dumb-dumb, stupid, moronic and besides-the-point criticisms here on Amazon by the 'average-Joe'.1).  Brolin's character was so stupid for not ever thinking there was a tracker on the money.  Really?  Why would he do that?  He's an ex-vietnam vet, a simple man, a hunter.  In the moment, why would think of such things when the film gives no indications regarding his knowing of the sources of money, or drug deals in general?2).  When the tracker is found, why doesn't he turn it off?  Well, DUH!!!  He's a hunter.  He was using the tracker to lure Chigurth to his room so he could shoot him.  Of course Chigurth's gimmicky method of opening doors foils that plan.3)  Why would Brolin go back to give the Mexican water?  Well, apparently his character didn't know he was in a thriller.  He made a human decision based on guilt.  It happens, maybe not to you, but it doesn happen.  Brolin's character is a slow-burn type of guy.  He's not dumb but slow.  Only in the moment of the chase does he seem to move and think fast.  Hmmm, that might also be saying something.Okay, I've had a enough.  This movie is brilliant.  Every character and situation is a reflection of another all the way down to Woody Harrelson's slick tracker(a very well acted and vividly written cameo).

It was hard shopping on line to obtain ""No Country For Old Men"" as a new Blu-ray in the desired 2:35:1 screen aspect ratio.  Found what I wanted as used at a local store, the Amazon picture not matching what I purchased.  Used Blu-ray played perfectly in high definition.The Coen brothers rack up a far higher body count in ""No Country For Old Men"" than ""Fargo"".  Also more Oscars, includingDirection plus the Screenplay.  And the Coen Brothers present a villain who should rank second only to Hannibal Lecter (""Silence of the Lambs""), if the American Film Institute updated its list.  Javier Bardem's character, an unforgettable psychopath/serial killer, drives the plot, Bardem deservedly honored with an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.If you don't mind endless violence/homicide as necessarily linked to greed, illegal drugs, and a vast sum of money, this movie is a perfect contrast to ""Fargo"".  Both films feature law enforcement officers.  In ""Fargo"" Frances McDormand, the pregnant local police chief, tracks down criminals guilty of several murders, solving the case, all part of her job.  McDormand won the Oscar for Best Actress, and her character suffered no ill effects from expert police work.  We all could root for her.What a contrast in ""No Country For Old Men"", where Tommy Lee Jones plays a long-time sheriff unable to comprehend violent crimes a great deal worse than in ""Fargo"".  This new world of mayhem and mass murder is so overwhelmingly senseless/awful that the sheriff can't cope with it, solving nothing, and protecting nobody.The Tommy Lee Jones character decides that resignation as sheriff is his best option.  We can't root for him, a failure and quitter.  Jones is the ""old man"" in ""No Country for Old Men"".  This film has no real hero, while featuring multiple villains, such as hired killers and a foolhardy thief.  (I ended up rooting for the thief, probably a typical response, a great example of how the Coen brothers mess with our minds.)  We don't even learn whether the thief's wife was murdered, not entitled to such knowledge, and forced to guess.Only acting Oscar went to Javier Bardem's exceptional portrayal of a super-villain, whose behavior and choice of weapons are horrific.  He is not for the squeamish, just like this violent film, in which so many people are murdered, right from the start.",5,"Coen Brothers - Far More Bloody Than ""Fargo""",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2376,"['2007', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'was', 'hard', 'shopping', 'line', 'obtain', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'new', 'Blu-ray', 'desired', '2:35:1', 'screen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'what', 'wanted', 'used', 'local', 'store', 'Amazon', 'picture', 'not', 'matching', 'what', 'purchased', 'Used', 'Blu-ray', 'played', 'perfectly', 'high', 'definition.The', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'rack', 'up', 'far', 'higher', 'body', 'count', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Fargo', 'Also', 'more', 'Oscars', 'includingDirection', 'Screenplay', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'present', 'villain', 'who', 'should', 'rank', 'second', 'only', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'updated', 'list', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'character', 'unforgettable', 'psychopath/serial', 'killer', 'plot', 'Bardem', 'deservedly', 'honored', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'endless', 'violence/homicide', 'necessarily', 'linked', 'greed', 'illegal', 'drugs', 'vast', 'sum', 'money', 'movie', 'perfect', 'contrast', 'Fargo', 'films', 'feature', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'Fargo', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'pregnant', 'local', 'police', 'chief', 'down', 'criminals', 'guilty', 'several', 'murders', 'solving', 'case', 'part', 'job', 'McDormand', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'character', 'suffered', 'ill', 'effects', 'expert', 'police', 'work', 'could', 'root', 'her.What', 'contrast', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'where', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'long-time', 'sheriff', 'unable', 'comprehend', 'violent', 'crimes', 'great', 'deal', 'worse', 'Fargo', 'new', 'world', 'mayhem', 'mass', 'murder', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'senseless/awful', 'sheriff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cope', 'solving', 'nothing', 'protecting', 'nobody.The', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'character', 'resignation', 'sheriff', 'best', 'option', 'ca', ""n't"", 'root', 'failure', 'quitter', 'Jones', 'old', 'man', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'film', 'real', 'hero', 'featuring', 'multiple', 'villains', 'such', 'hired', 'killers', 'foolhardy', 'thief', 'ended', 'up', 'rooting', 'thief', 'probably', 'typical', 'response', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'mess', 'minds', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'learn', 'thief', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'not', 'entitled', 'such', 'knowledge', 'forced', 'guess.Only', 'acting', 'Oscar', 'went', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'exceptional', 'portrayal', 'super-villain', 'behavior', 'choice', 'weapons', 'are', 'horrific', 'not', 'squeamish', 'just', 'violent', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'murdered', 'right', 'start']",N/A

I like going into a movie that way, nothing given away in the trailor. I had some pre existing ideas, after all it's a Cohen perspective. I sat down expectling ""quirky"", but the Cohen's had better than that in store for me.Javier Bardeem is strangely handsome, even with the now famous haircut, but something quietly dark throws me off any assumptions I want to make about this silent type.  I know the movie is about drugs, greed, and integrity.  But along the way I learn that it's so much deeper than anything I expected.  It's the world layed out for us in the most base, cruel and vial format, where men not only don't have a heart, they walk the earth without a soul, guided by the most animal instincts a human body could possess on two legs.  There is no rhyme or reason to the killings for Bardeem. It seems he sets his sights on what he's hired to do and nothing, nothing gets in his way. He flips a coin, you live or die; it appears to be his only entertainment.  From his point of view, he's a man of his word; it's everything to him and the strength he draws from that conviction is what appears to keep him going.  He doesn't struggle with who he is, he already knows, and has no qualms about doing what he does to anyone, or the cost to himself. He's a terminator. The irony of the cattle gun, as his weapon of choice, is not lost here.  There is no interest in torture, just the swift shot to the brain and you're gone; not a seconds thought is wasted on it.Tommy Lee, just the opposite of morality.  Hard working man of law, he gets the way it's always been, the futility of life in the desert, the circumstances with which he faces every day knowing undoubtadly the evil of man will not ever end.Josh Brolin is the conduit that brings all the characters together.  He's a little of both men, which isn't easy.  He's certainly willing to gamble with his life and every aspect of it.Every scene connects seamlessly and I can say without a doubt, that this movie stayed with me for days, believing this cold blooded darkness is alive and well in the world.It is also my pick for the Best Movie Oscar.

84969,A23GFTVIETX7DS,0788882988,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[1, 3]","Through sweeping cinematography, excellent dialogue, and distinctive characters, this tale of a man hunted by a sociopath transcends its plot.  In the western plains, towns, and cities, a sociopath, Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is in pursuit of a large sum of cash from a drug deal.  Unfortunately for retired welder Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who finds the cash, Chigurh will stop at nothing to get it.  The small town sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones), who puts together what has happened, wants to get to Llewelyn, and a tracker (Woody Harrelson) hired by a drug lord wants to get to the money, all before the ruthless Chirgurh does,  The result is a tense, violent chase at the speed of small town life.The dialogue is so reminiscent of the Coen brothers' much earlier ""Fargo"" that it is surprising that much of it derives from a novel by a different writer, although the melding of Coens with Cormac McCarthy makes perfect sense.  In particular, the sheriff's exchanges with his deputy (Garrett Dillahunt) and his wife (played with down-to-earth confidence by Tess Harper)  give this film its greater context and rhythm as evil is treated with both matter-of-fact acceptance and disbelief.  Philosophy is doled out in brief parcels punctuated by pauses.Tommy Lee Jones has played this kind of character so many times that it is remarkable that he makes each one unique.  with its frighteningly  is pure evil, though even he lives by a set of rules, as ruthless as those are.  Brolin delivers a fine, sympathetic portrait of Llewelyn Moss.  And Bardem is simply terrifying with his monotone delivery and largely blank expression.""No Country for Old Men"" is about the unexpected ways evil enters the lives of ordinary people, and the toll it takes on those who try to stop it.  Because of the tension throughout, this theme is not clear until the last moments, in an ending that at first seems out-of-place and rushed (the last a valid critique.) Although much of the violence takes place off-screen, you can never tell when it won't, and that gives the impression of a bloody-and-gore film.  I find this to be one of the best Coen brother films, although it took several days of thinking about it afterward to realize it.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",5,"Disturbing, philosophical, oddly beautiful at times: a unique thriller (5- stars)",1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,2238,"['sweeping', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'distinctive', 'characters', 'tale', 'man', 'hunted', 'sociopath', 'plot', 'western', 'plains', 'towns', 'cities', 'sociopath', 'Chigurh', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'pursuit', 'large', 'sum', 'cash', 'drug', 'deal', 'Unfortunately', 'retired', 'welder', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'cash', 'Chigurh', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'small', 'town', 'sheriff', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'get', 'Llewelyn', 'tracker', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'hired', 'drug', 'lord', 'get', 'money', 'ruthless', 'Chirgurh', 'result', 'tense', 'violent', 'chase', 'speed', 'small', 'town', 'life.The', 'dialogue', 'so', 'reminiscent', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'much', 'earlier', 'Fargo', 'surprising', 'much', 'novel', 'different', 'writer', 'melding', 'Coens', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'perfect', 'sense', 'particular', 'sheriff', 'exchanges', 'deputy', 'Garrett', 'Dillahunt', 'wife', 'played', 'down-to-earth', 'confidence', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'give', 'film', 'greater', 'context', 'rhythm', 'evil', 'treated', 'matter-of-fact', 'acceptance', 'disbelief', 'Philosophy', 'doled', 'out', 'brief', 'parcels', 'punctuated', 'pauses.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'played', 'kind', 'character', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'remarkable', 'one', 'unique', 'frighteningly', 'pure', 'evil', 'though', 'even', 'set', 'rules', 'as', 'ruthless', 'are', 'Brolin', 'fine', 'sympathetic', 'portrait', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Bardem', 'simply', 'terrifying', 'monotone', 'delivery', 'largely', 'blank', 'expression', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'evil', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'people', 'toll', 'who', 'try', 'stop', 'tension', 'theme', 'not', 'clear', 'last', 'moments', 'ending', 'first', 'out-of-place', 'rushed', 'last', 'valid', 'critique', 'much', 'violence', 'place', 'off-screen', 'can', 'never', 'tell', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'impression', 'bloody-and-gore', 'film', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'Coen', 'brother', 'films', 'took', 'several', 'days', 'thinking', 'afterward', 'realize', 'it.', 'Debbie', 'Lee', 'Wesselmann']",N/A

The backgrounds of Southwest Texas, the multiple colors that showcase the vibrancy of the film, to the dark scenes that exhibit no problems and of course the overall details that you just never think of, are seen quite clearly on this title.Director of Photography Roger Deakins (""A Beautiful Mind"", ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Fargo"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"") continues to be one of the top DP's in the industry and was definitey deserving of an Academy Award nomination for his awesome cinematography.As for audio, this is where ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" takes a big step up to perfection.  Buena Vista Home Entertainment made sure the new soundtrack for this second version release utilized an English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit) track over the PCM version.  And boy, does it make a difference.  If you thought the gun shots as the bullets hiss, the rifle shots, a dogs being shot, vehicles moving, those action scenes alone sound clearer and punchier than the previous PCM track.  The dialogue is clear and there is just a sense of more clearer sound than the PCM track.  Quite frankly, this is the best audio treatment of the film and the last one was magnificent but for this 2-Disc Collector's Edition, audio is excellent!And again, the film was definitely deserving for its Academy Award nominations for its achievements in Sound and Sound Editing.  The crew did a wonderful job!SPECIAL FEATURES:This second version Blu-ray release of ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" is packed with special features.  From December 2007 to February 2008, television, live, online and radio interviews are presented on disc.  So, the hardcore filmmaker or the fans of the film definitely have plenty of content to watch and listen to.  As mentioned earlier in the review, this 2-Disc Collector's Edition comes with a new audio track, a digital copy of the film and five hours of special features.  Included are:* The Making Of No Country For Old Men - (24:29) A behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to create a Coen Brothers' movie.  Featuring interviews with the Coen Brothers, cast and crew.  Included on the last Blu-ray but nevertheless, very informative and entertaining to watch.  Also, how certain cast members were selected.  Surprising especially when you find out that Kelly Macdonald (Carla Jean) is from Scotland and has a strong, thick accent but played the character of a girl with a Southern drawl quite well!* Working with the Coens - (8:07) The cast and crew of No Country for Old Men talk about working with the legendary duo.  It's great to hear the cast and crew talk about working with the brothers and talk about how they want a certain scene a certain way.  Fun featurette that was included on the last Blu-ray.* The Diary of A Country Sheriff - (6 min.) A look at the relationship between Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh and Josh Brolin's Llewelyn Moss through the eyes of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones).  A good explanation of how this proud Sheriff who is about to retire notices that he probably is in no league to take on the crimes of today and the types of killers out there.  The days of being a sheriff with no weapons are a thing of the past.* Josh Brolin Unauthorized - (9 min.) An interesting perspective of ""behind-the-scenes"" as Josh Brolin interviews certain cast members and the crew.  A dramatic ""behind-the-scenes"" featuring the cast members with some sort of an edge.  A very interesting featurette.* Press Timeline - A treasure trove of in-depth interviews and conversations with the Coen Brothers, Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem--never before available on disc--offering viewers the most comprehensive look ever at the making of No Country for Old Men.  This is where the bulk of the special features are featured and what's so cool is that some of these are online interviews, live with audience interviews, radio interviews, etc.1.

The film has its many layers but I think that Javier Bardem's excellent portrayal of the psychopath Anton Chigurh is going to ruffle some feathers because of his overall look, his demeanor and his eyes of the thrill of a kill, you can't help but think how twisted this character is and for certain characters, who encounter Chigurh, you are at the edge of your seat as he wants to determine the fate if they live or die.  It's twisted and his means of killing and the barrage of violence is not going to make the squeamish any happier.This is possible the Coen Brothers darkest film.  Granted ""Fargo"" was a dark film but ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" is well-written, well-acted, well-filmed...it's the Coen Brothers masterpiece extravaganza.  Dark humor, violence galore but a well-told plot and characters that you want to watch.For me, the violence was excessive but it was needed.  It was very important to show Chigurh as this psychopath and the level of detail that went into showing those bloody scenes was well done by the crew.As the Coen Brothers and Javier Bardem did a wonderful job, you also have to give the thumbs up to the other talent.Josh Brolin being denied an Academy Award nomination was a bit of a shock.  Where many people have not been fortunate to get away from Chigurh, the character of Llewelyn Moss was a constant challenge but you actually felt yourself rooting for Moss for a little while.Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell was portrayed very well.  A World War II Vet and proud Sheriff who is now having to deal with drug deals and mafia style killings, he's not prepared to take on these type of people.  This is not the same country he lived in before, it's become dangerous and hence the title ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"".I will have to say the shining star was Kelly MacDonald as Carla Jean.  At first, you think that the woman is the token broad at the beginning of the film but her final scenes perhaps is a scene that has left many people wondering what happened to her character.  It's because her character was able to do something that many of the other characters have not and thus, comes away being someone special.  And I also have to say that I was shocked to find out that Macdonald was Scottish and had this thick accent and to hear hear playing a woman with this Southern drawl was amazing.  Well done!Many people who purchased the first Blu-ray disc may be asking themselves, is this second collector's edition worth it?  Absolutely yes!  The new DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is just amazing.  Combine that with already the perfect video, video and audio are just perfect.  The special features also gets a 5 with five hours of interview footage and in depth knowledge behind what the Coen Brothers wanted to accomplish in the film, to hear the talents (with the exception of Tommy Lee Jones) really show their passion towards this film and just very good insight of the making of the film.So, as much as I hate re-releases especially if they are not long after the previous was released, in this case, I have to say that the release of ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" was warranted.  For such an incredible and magnificent film, it deserved special treatment and now it does.""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN - 2-DISC COLLECTOR'S EDITION"" receives an A+ and is highly recommended!",5,The 2-Disc Collector's Edition on Blu-ray is the definitive version to own!,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,10684,"['Violent', 'dark', 'gripping', 'off-humor', 'tone', 'other', 'NO', 'COUNTRY', 'FOR', 'OLD',

84971,A3956O40ZZYFMY,0788882988,"Dennis ""barbarosa""","[3, 4]","When I saw this movie upon its theatrical release I was sure it would finally launch Javier Bardem as a Hollywood actor of much demand. I had seen the man master several foreign film roles and was happy to see him in this Coen Brothers release. He did nothing different than he had in every foreign film I had seen him in, single handedly making the film great by way of applying his superb acting ""chops"". His skill even allowed one to forget the rather eccentric movie making efforts of Coen Brothers films, truly quite the accomplishment itself. The film and the actor were recognized for the obvious but as several years have now passed since the films release, Hollywood maintains its famed flaw of failing to recognize and take advantage of true acting skill. How many miserable Nicolas Cage movies have come and gone, or mindless DeCaprio vehicles similarly popping up and quickly being forgotten since No Country For Old Men was released with nothing but a void from Hollywood for films featuring the vastly more skilled Bardem?I digress and am merely wool-gathering though. No Country For Old Men is a must see. Easily the best film of its year and at least for me, a film that will never be forgotten. Rent it, buy it, steal it...anything is worth the cost to see this great film. Forget the popcorn, it will sit unbothered, growing cold and stale while this fine film takes the viewer on a journey never to be forgotten.",5,"Should have ""launched"" Bardem",1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,1431,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'sure', 'would', 'finally', 'launch', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'much', 'demand', 'had', 'seen', 'man', 'master', 'several', 'foreign', 'film', 'roles', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'release', 'did', 'nothing', 'different', 'had', 'foreign', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'single', 'handedly', 'making', 'film', 'great', 'way', 'applying', 'superb', 'acting', 'chops', 'skill', 'even', 'allowed', 'one', 'forget', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'movie', 'making', 'efforts', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'films', 'truly', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'film', 'actor', 'were', 'recognized', 'obvious', 'several', 'years', 'have', 'now', 'passed', 'films', 'release', 'Hollywood', 'famed', 'flaw', 'failing', 'recognize', 'take', 'advantage', 'true', 'acting', 'skill', 'How', 'many', 'miserable', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'gone', 'mindless', 'DeCaprio', 'vehicles', 'similarly', 'popping', 'up', 'quickly', 'being', 'forgotten', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'was', 'released', 'nothing', 'void', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'featuring', 'vastly', 'more', 'skilled', 'Bardem', 'digress', 'am', 'merely', 'wool-gathering', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'must', 'see', 'Easily', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'least', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Rent', 'buy', 'steal', 'anything', 'cost', 'see', 'great', 'film', 'Forget', 'popcorn', 'will', 'sit', 'unbothered', 'growing', 'cold', 'stale', 'fine', 'film', 'viewer', 'journey', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten']",N/A
84972,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0788882988,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 6]","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)BEWARE SPOILERS (and tedious plot discussions)The way the last quarter or so of this movie was cut makes me wonder, who did the cutting and what was the rush?  We see Llewelyn dead but we don't see him die.  We can presume the money went to Mexican drug dealers but we don't see that happen.  Or--because Chigurh gives the kid a hundred dollar bill for his shirt--maybe HE got the money.  Whether Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) is still alive as Chigurh walks out the door is unclear--intentionally unclear since the psychopathic fatalist gave her a coin flip.  However she wouldn't let Chigurh avoid responsibility for her death by calling the coin flip.  What's a madman to do?  We never find out.  Or--since we see Chigurh checking the bottoms of his boots for something (blood?) as he leaves her place--maybe he did kill her.I also wonder about keeping such a sickie alive as the closing credits run.  I wasn't keeping count but Chigurh wantonly killed somewhere around a dozen people, mostly just because he could.  I think this kind of character--a psychopath with a code (you harm, insult or even inconvenience me and you die)--plays well in this age of violence in which we live.  He is something like shock and awe made flesh.Don't misunderstand me.  This is a riveting flick, as one would expect from Ethan Coen and Joel Coen.  The acting, especially by Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin is superlative.  Bardem, with the thick pageboy hairdo and the big malevolent eyes and the no nonsense conversational style, is particularly good.  Brolin becomes the country and cocky Llewelyn Moss very well.  He is much more likeable in the movie than in the book.One thing that the movie cleared up for me was the business with the money in the air conditioning shaft at the motel.  Llewelyn puts it there in the first place to hide it.  When he comes back to the motel he sees that the drapes are a bit parted and he knows somebody's in there waiting for him.  So he rents the room on the other side and manages to pull the suitcase out.  The Mexicans who were waiting for him didn't have the tracking device (transponder) so they didn't know the money was nearby.  Chigurh knows of course, but by the time he is through shooting the Mexicans, Llewelyn is gone.A problem in the very beginning of the movie comes up when Llewelyn acknowledges that he is about to do something incredibly foolish.  He goes back to the bloody scene in the scrub desert to bring the dying Mexican some water.  The fact that he says it's foolish doesn't excuse it as a plot device.  The guy was just about dead when Llewelyn left him many hours earlier.  Coming back now with water isn't going to save him.  Furthermore, Llewelyn was originally indifferent to his thirst.  There must have been some water or something to drink somewhere in all the vehicles on the scene, but Llewelyn doesn't bother looking.  It's curious that Llewelyn didn't realize that bringing the man who had been bleeding for many hours some water wasn't really going to help.  If he wanted to help he could have dialed 911.By the way, this device, which has the effect of giving Llewelyn a ""fatal flaw"" in the Greek dramatic sense, was also in Cormac McCarthy's novel.  If Llewelyn doesn't return to the scene, the story would play out a bit differently, to say the least.  Since Chigurh has the transponder he would locate the money and possibly take Llewelyn by surprise.What are the chances that Carson Wells (Woody Harrison) is able to go to the exact spot where Llewelyn threw the money over the fence and into bushes?  Close to zero, I would say.  I suspect that the Coens were going to do something with this unlikely plot event but as it turns out, they didn't.  In fact, there is a lot they didn't do or show, so much so, I just think they got overwhelmed with all the footage they had and the time constraints and just sliced it up near the end.Now, why is this called ""No Country for Old Men""?  Cormac McCarthy took his cue from the poem ""Sailing to Byzantium"" by William Butler Yeats.  Here is the opening stanza.That is no country for old men.  The youngin one another's arms, birds in the trees--Those dying generations--at their song,The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer longWhatever is begotten, born, and dies.Caught in that sensual music all neglectMonuments of unageing intellect.The theme of Yeats' poem is the impermanence of this world, and so he set sail ""To the holy city of Byzantium"" where things are made of more permanent stuff such ""as Grecian goldsmiths make"" and where things are eternal like ideas.One of McCarthy's points is that the bloody violence of the border towns of West Texas about which he writes resembles more ""the mackerel-crowded seas"" than the holy city of Byzantium, and the ""sensual music"" is the sound of bullet hitting bone from those dying generations at their song.  Additionally, the old men in the story, Ed Tom Bell (played very effectively by Tommy Lee Jones), Roscoe Giddens (Rodger Boyce), and Ellis (Barry Corbin), feel estranged from the lust of the young after money and drugs.The premise of the movie centers around a dope drop in the semi-desert gone bad that Llewelyn Moss stumbles onto some time after the shooting has stopped.  Bodies everywhere.  Bullet holes in vehicles, blood, etc.  Moss is wondering, where's the money?  He follows the bloody trail of someone carrying something heavy and finds him and it.  It's a carrying case with $2-million in hundred dollar bills.Needless to say that kind of cash attracts a lot of flies.",4,"Lean, mean adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel",1210982400,"05 17,

He could have fought the guy in the lobby, or just kicked the psycho in the face while going up the staicase.The psycho killer must have gone to Med School. In less than One Minute, he can walk into a pharmacy that he has NEVER been to in his life, and gather all he needs to treat a bad gunshot wound in less than 15 seconds. THEN, he has the skill to use all the crap he stole so quickly from the pharmacy, and OPERATE on HIMSELF with the aid of a dental mirror. Come On.!!!!!The psycho killer easily breaks into ANY room with a tank of compressed air that powers an impact driver. NO WAY that little tank has enough pressure to do that. And IF it did, a guy would not just be able to hold it in his hand while it blew out the insides of a lock set. The tool would have to be SECURED to the door knob, not just held loosely in a guys hand. Good Grief.The last 10 minutes should have ended up on the cutting room floor.

I expect some external dialogue and would almost rather have all dialogue than none. Although I could not finish the book The Road, I will watch the movie when it's released. And tonight I watched another McCarthy adaptation: No Country for Old Men by the Coen Brother's whose  O' Brother Where Art Thou? was absolutely not my favorite film. I liken No Country more to their Fargo (starring the wonderful Frances McDormand) with the subtly, mundane motif of fate pulling the puppet strings of humanity in the furthest reaches of Middle America.Bardem's buzz is dead on, and albeit I've not seen all Oscar nominated films, My God, this man's already won his Oscar, and I would even contend that his hair should get its own statuette. Bardem plays a terminator-like assassin chockfull of actual emotions. His looping, frame play with the quarter of fate toyed with the idea that in the large scheme of things, everything is absolutely inconsequential and completely noncoincidental all-at-once. He fails to assassinate the first game's player, while the second it's understood he's murdered her before he simply walks for her house as he checks for blood on his shoes.Although I can barely consider anything Brolin's ever been in, I think we can agree that Tommy Lee Jones is one of the most talented (and sometimes underrated) actors of his generation. His age, dropping wrinkles, and eyes just add watery charm to his Sheriff's character who's subtly torn between bringing home Brolin's Llewellyn to his wife Carla Jean and retiring from the force. He eventually makes one decision that directly correlates to the other.If you're looking for a thinking man's movie with a paucity of action then enjoy this film. It's brief staccato violence only enhances our final ironically enigmatic scene with our antagonist, while Jones' discussion with his wife about a dream in which his deceased father goes ahead of him over snowy mountains to make a fire and await his son's arrival, truly suggests that the onset of Jones' final adventure into retirement makes early 1980's Texas no longer a country for old men, or at least for the men in this book as the screen turns black.",4,An awesome flick!,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,2327,"['tried', 'read', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'Road', 'year', 'ago', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'not', 'something', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'appreciate', 'literature', 'expect', 'external', 'dialogue', 'would', 'almost', 'rather', 'have', 'dialogue', 'none', 'could', 'not', 'finish', 'book', 'Road', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'when', 'released', 'tonight', 'watched', 'McCarthy', 'adaptation', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Coen', 'Brother', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'was', 'absolutely', 'not', 'favorite', 'film', 'liken', 'Country', 'more', 'Fargo', 'starring', 'wonderful', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'subtly', 'mundane', 'motif', 'fate', 'pulling', 'puppet', 'strings', 'humanity', 'furthest', 'reaches', 'Middle', 'America.Bardem', 'buzz', 'dead', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'films', 'My', 'God', 'man', 'already', 'won', 'Oscar', 'would', 'even', 'contend', 'hair', 'should', 'get', 'own', 'statuette', 'Bardem', 'terminator-like', 'assassin', 'chockfull', 'actual', 'emotions', 'looping', 'frame', 'play', 'quarter', 'fate', 'toyed', 'idea', 'large', 'scheme', 'things', 'everything', 'absolutely', 'inconsequential', 'completely', 'noncoincidental', 'all-at-once', 'assassinate', 'first', 'game', 'player', 'second', 'understood', 'murdered', 'simply', 'walks', 'house', 'blood', 'shoes.Although', 'can', 'barely', 'consider', 'anything', 'Brolin', 'ever', 'been', 'think', 'can', 'agree', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'sometimes', 'underrated', 'actors', 'generation', 'age', 'dropping', 'wrinkles', 'eyes', 'just', 'add', 'watery', 'charm', 'Sheriff', 'character', 'who', 'subtly', 'torn', 'bringing', 'home', 'Brolin', 'Llewellyn', 'wife', 'Carla', 'Jean', 'retiring', 'force', 'eventually', 'one', 'decision', 'directly', 'other.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'thinking', 'man', 'movie', 'paucity', 'action', 'then', 'enjoy', 'film', 'brief', 'staccato', 'violence', 'only', 'final', 'ironically', 'enigmatic', 'scene', 'antagonist', 'Jones', 'discussion', 'wife', 'dream', 'deceased', 'father', 'ahead', 'snowy', 'mountains', 'make', 'fire', 'await', 'son', 'arrival', 'truly', 'onset', 'Jones', 'final', 'adventure', 'retirement', 'early', '1980', 'Texas', 'no', 'longer', 'country', 'old', 'men', 'least', 'men', 'book', 'screen', 'black']",N/A
84977,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,0788882988,D. Hartley,"[4, 5]","The bodies pile up faster than you can say ""Blood Simple"" in Joel and Ethan Coen's neo-noir, ""No Country For Old Men"", a true return to classic form and one of the most confidently assured pieces of pure filmmaking that I have seen in quite some time.The Coen's screenplay (adapted quite faithfully from the Cormac McCarthy novel) is rich in characterization and thankfully devoid of the self-consciously ""quirky"" tics that have left some of their efforts from the past several years teetering on the verge of self-parody.The story is set circa 1980, amongst the sagebrush and desert heat of the Tex-Mex border, where the deer and the antelope play. One day, a pickup-drivin' good ol' boy named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is out shootin' at some food (the playful antelope) when he suddenly encounters a fleeing, grievously wounded pit bull. The trail of blood leads him to discover the grisly aftermath of a major shootout. The one lone survivor is too dehydrated to talk, but a pickup truck loaded with heroin and a satchel stuffed with 2 million in cash speak volumes about what went down. Llewelyn skedaddles back to the trailer to tell sweet young wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) to pack a bag and start thinking about early retirement.""Someone"" is always going to miss 2 million dollars, naturally, and the antelope hunter quickly becomes the hunted. Enter one of the most unique movie heavies in recent memory-Anton Chigurh (a supremely focused Javier Bardem) who has been hired to track down the money, with extreme prejudice. Chigurh is a textbook sociopath (he literally slaughters people like cattle, with a pneumatic prod); but he does appear to live by a code (of sorts). It's not unlike the same kind of twisted code that drives Lee Van Cleef's heartless ""Angel Eyes"" character  in ""The Good, the Bad & the Ugly"" to see his contracts through to the end, regardless of any ""collateral damage"" that may ensue.In fact, the Coens do seem to be channeling Sergio Leone all throughout ""No Country For Old Men"". If Chigurh is the ""bad"" (the ""Angel Eyes"" of the story) and Llewelyn is the ""ugly"" (like ""Tuco"", he's a smarter-than-he-looks oaf who has a native talent for crafty opportunism) then world-weary Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the ""good"", and the conscience of the story (he's the only player in the tale who doesn't have a self-serving agenda and actually shows compassion toward the suffering of others). He's an old-school ""lawman"" who (you guessed it) comes from a long line of ""lawmen"".Complicating the chase even more is the addition of one of Chigurh's professional rivals, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson, in a nicely droll performance) an ex-green beret who has also been hired to chase down the loot (by a competing employer).The actors are uniformly excellent. Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh is very understated, but still quite menacing, made all the more uber-creepy by his benign Peter Tork haircut. His character is a man of few words; in the few scenes where he does ""engage"" conversation, it is with the detached, feigned interest of a clinical psychiatrist who is watching the clock and wishing the session would end so he could get to the golf course.With all of its tailor-made twists and turns, this tale is a slam-dunk for the Coens, and they gleefully take the ball and run with it. Everything about the film is pitch-perfect-the script, the casting, the editing, you name it. The cinematography is expertly handled by Roger Deakins, who has been the brothers' DP of choice since ""Barton Fink"". While there are a few signature Coen camera shots (the ""front bumper cam"" eating up the asphalt, the obsession with characters whizzing past ""now entering...""/""now leaving..."" highway signs), they are used judiciously and serve the narrative well. As per usual, it's the masterful implementation of little details (use of ambient sound, subtle POV perspectives and a Hitchcockian ability to milk suspense from focusing on the most mundane objects) that make this very much a ""Coen brothers film"".",4,And you will know them by the trail of dead,1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,4042,"['bodies', 'pile', 'up', 'faster', 'can', 'say', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'neo-noir', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'true', 'return', 'classic', 'form', 'one', 'most', 'confidently', 'assured', 'pieces', 'pure', 'filmmaking', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'time.The', 'Coen', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'quite', 'faithfully', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'novel', 'rich', 'characterization', 'thankfully', 'devoid', 'self-consciously', 'quirky', 'tics', 'have', 'left', 'efforts', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'teetering', 'verge', 'self-parody.The', 'story', 'set', 'circa', '1980', 'sagebrush', 'desert', 'heat', 'Tex-Mex', 'border', 'where', 'deer', 'antelope', 'play', 'One', 'day', 'pickup-drivin', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'named', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'out', 'shootin', 'food', 'playful', 'antelope', 'when', 'suddenly', 'fleeing', 'grievously', 'wounded', 'pit', 'bull', 'trail', 'blood', 'discover', 'grisly', 'aftermath', 'major', 'shootout', 'one', 'lone', 'survivor', 'too', 'dehydrated', 'talk', 'pickup', 'truck', 'loaded', 'heroin', 'satchel', 'stuffed', '2', 'million', 'cash', 'speak', 'volumes', 'what', 'went', 'down', 'Llewelyn', 'back', 'trailer', 'tell', 'sweet', 'young', 'wife', 'Carla', 'Jean', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'pack', 'bag', 'start', 'thinking', 'about', 'early', 'retirement', 'Someone', 'always', 'going', 'miss', '2', 'million', 'dollars', 'naturally', 'antelope', 'hunter', 'quickly', 'hunted', 'Enter', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'movie', 'heavies', 'recent', 'memory-Anton', 'Chigurh', 'supremely', 'focused', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'track', 'down', 'money', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'Chigurh', 'textbook', 'sociopath', 'literally', 'people', 'cattle', 'pneumatic', 'prod', 'appear', 'live', 'code', 'sorts', 'not', 'same', 'kind', 'twisted', 'code', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'heartless', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'character', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'see', 'contracts', 'end', 'regardless', 'collateral', 'damage', 'may', 'ensue.In', 'fact', 'Coens', 'do', 'seem', 'be', 'channeling', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Chigurh', 'bad', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'story', 'Llewelyn', 'ugly', 'Tuco', 'smarter-than-he-looks', 'oaf', 'who', 'native', 'talent', 'crafty', 'opportunism', 'then', 'world-weary', 'Sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'good', 'conscience', 'story', 'only', 'player', 'tale', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'self-serving', 'agenda', 'actually', 'compassion', 'suffering', 'others', 'old-school', 'lawman', 'who', 'guessed', 'long', 'line', 'lawmen', '.Complicating', 'chase', 'even', 'more', 'addition', 'one', 'Chigurh', 'professional', 'rivals', 'Carson', 'Wells', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'nicely', 'droll', 'performance', 'ex-green', 'beret', 'who', 'also', 'been', 'hired', 'chase', 'down', 'loot', 'competing', 'employer', '.The', 'actors', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Bardem', 'portrayal', 'Chigurh', 'very', 'understated', 'still', 'quite', 'menacing', 'made', 'more', 'uber-creepy', 'benign', 'Peter', 'Tork', 'haircut', 'character', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'engage', 'conversation', 'detached', 'feigned', 'interest', 'clinical', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'watching', 'clock', 'wishing', 'session', 'would', 'end', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'golf', 'tailor-made', 'twists', 'turns', 'tale', 'slam-dunk', 'Coens', 'gleefully', 'take', 'ball', 'run', 'Everything', 'film', 'pitch-perfect-the', 'script', 'casting', 'editing', 'name', 'cinematography', 'expertly', 'handled', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'who', 'been', 'brothers', 'DP', 'choice', 'Barton', 'Fink', 'are', 'few', 'signature', 'Coen', 'camera', 'shots', 'front', 'bumper', 'cam', 'eating', 'up', 'asphalt', 'obsession', 'characters', 'whizzing', 'now', 'entering', '/', 'now', 'leaving', 'highway', 'signs', 'are', 'used', 'judiciously', 'serve', 'narrative', 'well', 'usual', 'masterful', 'implementation', 'little', 'details', 'use', 'ambient', 'sound', 'subtle', 'POV', 'perspectives', 'Hitchcockian', 'ability', 'milk', 'suspense', 'focusing', 'most', 'mundane', 'objects', 'make', 'very', 'much', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film']",N/A
84978,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,0788882988,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 7]","From the first few minutes of Joel and Ethan Coen's film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, ""No Country for Old Men,"" I was hooked.  The opening scenes of the Texas hill country vaguely remind me of the golden beauty of Tuscany--a wild starkness sans the cypress trees that suggests the purity and serenity of an open landscape where from the beginning of time, men roamed simply because they wanted to and could. These men learned to manage not only the land--making it work for them in a symbiotic way where neither was destroyed and a careful reverent balance was maintained--but also and more importantly controlled the insidious evil that unfurled within this domain since the snake slithered into the Garden of Eden. As one of the triumvirate of main characters, Anton Chigurh, played with a succinct and taciturn cruelty by Javier Bardem, proves as he strangles his arresting officer with the very cuffs meant to restrain him, now darkness pervades; moral stability still lives on, albeit conditioned by what is thought to be lackadaisically acceptable for ""modern"" times.  Most definitely, the delicate balance once barely managed has spiraled out of the control of its sentinels.But what can be done about this rampant evil?  Nothing much, it seems.  We are damned if we do, and damned if we don't.In ""No Country for Old Men,"" the inundation of evil (call it corruptness, depravity, immorality . . .whatever) that began with less dramatically insistent indicators like the absence of manners--no longer requiring the respectful usage of `sir' and `ma'am'--or the breakdown of appropriate dress--eyesores like wearing green hair and piercing bones in one's nose--has accelerated to an intensity level where drug deals, bloody carnage and murders are commonplace.  The infringement of this darker tolerance brings with it a Pandora's box of latter day plagues that symbolically battle-worn lawmen like Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempt to clamp shut--with limited success.  One gets the sense of an overwhelming encroachment of all things bad--things that after awhile seem tame only through the conditioning of what we are told is acceptable.  Indeed, Bell knows that monsters like Chigurh are legion; wearing a marked world-weary grimace of frustration and futility on his face, he regrets, as his retirement looms, that time has outdated his methods and has matured him into the role of commentator rather than activator.  His hopes and aspirations lie now only in a field of dreams in which he must eventually awaken.In sharp contrast to Bell's caricature of the quintessential onlooker, Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin)--his brash economy of motion belies his way lesser rank in the war between good and evil stalks the Texas hills with the easy nonchalant grace of the antelope he hunts.  Happening upon a drug deal gone wrong and the ultimate riches-of-the-city temptation--a valise filled with money that could enrich his life with his pretty little wife (Kelly Macdonald) 2.4 million-fold, he catapults into a plan that Sheriff Bell realizes from afar will take him down.  Most of the film's action follows Moss as he attempts to outsmart the devil incarnate (the tenacious Bardem sporting a haircut reminiscent of a dark-side 70s Gerard Depardieu and his weapon of choice--a nasty little dehumanizing compressed-air-mechanized stun gun used to kill cattle.)  Minor characters pop up like targets in an arcade shooting game--mere examples of the genuine coldness of this killer and the Coen brothers' penchant for over-the-top, gory, eye-popping brutality that almost desensitizes the audience like an overexposure to the horrific behavior of Hannibal Lecter in the three Thomas Harris inspired films.Not only do the Coen brothers enjoy a good blood bath, they take pleasure in bitter twists of irony.  Greed motivates the good guy--Moss fights tooth and nail to keep tainted money and jeopardize his wife's security--while a bald honesty holds bad guy Chigurh in check; the strange Anton allows his victims a choice by which he religiously stands.  Oddly, for him, a promise made becomes a promise kept.In terms of performance, the workings of all three of the major roles here border on what seems an effortless genius.  In particular, Bardem enthralls each and every time he enters a scene wielding that oxymoronic brand of macabre attraction and repulsion is reminiscent of Anthony Hopkin's skill in portraying the murderous cannibal in ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Brolin forges headfirst--his would-be sheep-for-the-slaughter a veritable thinking machine of non-stop action.  Jones brings all his wryness to this role--the character Bell seems written specifically to display the adeptness of his acting ability.Bottom line?  ""No Country for Old Men"" is not intended for a general audience--so parents think twice about bringing children into the theatre to see this one.  The images of bloody brutality come swiftly with little warning--I spent much of the time squeezing my eyes shut to avoid the virtual spatter of blood.  Otherwise, the film, seemingly an allegory for the eternal battle between good and evil extends beyond the obvious clouding over with nihilistic predetermination while presenting a world where conditioning to the nastier aspects of life renders all that blood-letting mere accoutrements meant to entertain rather than horrify.  Fascinating and highly recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",5,Going to Hell in a Hand-Basket -A Nihilistic Tale,1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,5467,"['first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Joel',

84979,A23XVF23C7BHP0,0788882988,"D. M. Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough""","[1, 5]","Wow what a terrific film. Not many films can get away with being over two hours long, but this movie kept my attention for all of its 122 minutes. The plot is loosely based on ""A Simple Plan"" in which someone finds some drug money by chance, and intent on keeping this, puts himself and his family in danger. The way in which the story is told owes much to Pulp Fiction, with several groups of characters who never meet each other, or whom only do so en passant. Likewise, there is a debt owed to Psycho; where the audience is wrong-footed into thinking that one character is the star of the film, only to have that character give way to another person part way through the film. The Coen brothers go one better than Hitchcock, however, and have a third good guy (Woody Harrelson from Cheers) take over halfway through, only to be blown to bits a short while later.There is some controversy over whether this is a western. It's debatable, but my vote goes to ""yes"". There's classic western themes of good against bad, people both good and bad operating outside the law, a law which proves ineffectual due to the huge extent of gun ownership, the setting on the Tex-Mex border, the scene with horses, and the white cowboy hats worn by all four of the principle good guys. There's even an ""old timer"" there to tell tales and give advice.In contrast to the white hat-wearers, Chiguhr, Javier Bardem's baddie wears only black for most of the film(in fact it has to be said, he has a very gay sense of style, from his hair, to his cropped jacket and tight buttock-revealing trousers...notably he only seems to be enjoying himself when on the floor strangling a policeman who is lying on top of him in a very homoerotic fashion). The star of the film is undoubtedly this villain, the peculiar looking and acting Javier Bardem, and he has a truth to his character consitent with his zealous belief in principles. His callousness might seem unbelievable, but it's clear that this is an instinct which ensures his survival at times when lesser baddies fall by the wayside. He is consistent, whereas the good people are inconstant, lose concentration, or make unnecessary allowances.Josh Brolin plays the everyman character who finds the money, being a resourceful Vietnam veteran with McGuyver-like skills at making things, now making a meagre living and living in a trailer home. He's likeable despite being trigger happy and a little amoral at times.Tommy Lee Jones's Sherrif decides to retire BEFORE he gets old, having found many old men killed during the course of his investigation (hence the title). By contrast, women don't come off very well in this film. It's almost irrelevant whether the main female character lives or dies (it's not shown), and most women are either there as support for men, a nagging mother-in-law, or harridan-like gate-keepers. Only the final scene of Kelly MacDonald's character Carla, shows her to have any character, and in this one scene she does what no man has done before; she refuses to play Chiguhr's game. How this is resolved isn't seen on screen, but it's interesting that no women are seen to be killed in this movie.In contrast to Pulp Fiction, the film benefits from the minimalist score. There's no sweeping James Horner strings or Danny Elfman cellos here. The sound is presented as though it's all naturalistic, for example the first ten minutes or so are accompanied only by the sound of the wind, giving the impression of the stark, desolate landscape much better than a score could ever do.Apart from Brolin and Jones, the film is cast mainly with lesser-known actors who all put in competent performances, leading us to concentrate on the duels and gun battles between the four main characters. Although there isn't a normal resolution to the film, it does seem quite satisfying at the end that Jones's character is still alive, even though he doesn't succeed in capturing Chiguhr.I would recommend this film to anyone who likes Pulp Fiction, Westerns, and intelligent cinema.",5,"No country for old men...or women, really!",1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,4023,"['Wow', 'what', 'terrific', 'film', 'Not', 'many', 'films', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'being', 'over', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'movie', 'kept', 'attention', '122', 'minutes', 'plot', 'loosely', 'based', 'A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'someone', 'drug', 'money', 'chance', 'intent', 'keeping', 'family', 'danger', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'owes', 'much', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'several', 'groups', 'characters', 'who', 'never', 'meet', 'other', 'whom', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'en', 'passant', 'Likewise', 'debt', 'owed', 'Psycho', 'where', 'audience', 'wrong-footed', 'thinking', 'one', 'character', 'star', 'film', 'only', 'have', 'character', 'give', 'way', 'person', 'part', 'way', 'film', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'go', 'one', 'better', 'Hitchcock', 'however', 'have', 'third', 'good', 'guy', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Cheers', 'take', 'over', 'halfway', 'only', 'be', 'blown', 'bits', 'short', 'while', 'controversy', 'western', 'debatable', 'vote', 'yes', 'classic', 'western', 'themes', 'good', 'bad', 'people', 'good', 'bad', 'operating', 'law', 'law', 'ineffectual', 'due', 'huge', 'extent', 'gun', 'ownership', 'setting', 'Tex-Mex', 'border', 'scene', 'horses', 'white', 'cowboy', 'hats', 'worn', 'four', 'principle', 'good', 'guys', 'even', 'old', 'timer', 'there', 'tell', 'tales', 'give', 'advice.In', 'contrast', 'white', 'hat-wearers', 'Chiguhr', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'baddie', 'only', 'black', 'most', 'film', 'fact', 'be', 'said', 'very', 'gay', 'sense', 'style', 'hair', 'cropped', 'jacket', 'tight', 'buttock-revealing', 'trousers', 'notably', 'only', 'be', 'enjoying', 'when', 'floor', 'strangling', 'policeman', 'who', 'lying', 'top', 'very', 'homoerotic', 'fashion', 'star', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'villain', 'peculiar', 'looking', 'acting', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'truth', 'character', 'consitent', 'zealous', 'belief', 'principles', 'callousness', 'might', 'seem', 'unbelievable', 'clear', 'instinct', 'survival', 'times', 'when', 'lesser', 'baddies', 'fall', 'wayside', 'consistent', 'good', 'people', 'are', 'inconstant', 'lose', 'concentration', 'make', 'unnecessary', 'allowances.Josh', 'Brolin', 'everyman', 'character', 'who', 'money', 'being', 'resourceful', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'McGuyver-like', 'skills', 'making', 'things', 'now', 'making', 'meagre', 'living', 'living', 'trailer', 'home', 'likeable', 'being', 'trigger', 'happy', 'little', 'amoral', 'times.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Sherrif', 'retire', 'old', 'having', 'found', 'many', 'old', 'men', 'killed', 'course', 'investigation', 'hence', 'title', 'contrast', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'almost', 'irrelevant', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'lives', 'dies', 'not', 'shown', 'most', 'women', 'are', 'either', 'there', 'support', 'men', 'nagging', 'mother-in-law', 'harridan-like', 'gate-keepers', 'Only', 'final', 'scene', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'character', 'Carla', 'have', 'character', 'one', 'scene', 'what', 'man', 'done', 'play', 'Chiguhr', 'game', 'How', 'resolved', ""n't"", 'seen', 'screen', 'interesting', 'women', 'are', 'seen', 'be', 'killed', 'movie.In', 'contrast', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'film', 'benefits', 'minimalist', 'score', 'sweeping', 'James', 'Horner', 'strings', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'cellos', 'here', 'sound', 'presented', 'naturalistic', 'example', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'accompanied', 'only', 'sound', 'wind', 'giving', 'impression', 'stark', 'desolate', 'landscape', 'much', 'better', 'score', 'could', 'ever', 'do.Apart', 'Brolin', 'Jones', 'film', 'cast', 'mainly', 'lesser-known', 'actors', 'who', 'put', 'competent', 'performances', 'leading', 'concentrate', 'duels', 'gun', 'battles', 'four', 'main', 'characters', ""n't"", 'normal', 'resolution', 'film', 'seem', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'end', 'Jones', 'character', 'still', 'alive', 'even', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'capturing', 'Chiguhr.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Westerns', 'intelligent', 'cinema']",N/A

In the book, the accident is followed by a long lucubration in italics which is extremely boring.

The movie is actually pointed at the viewer with the intention of gripping and entertaining, by comparison with the accustomed onanistic solipsism of the Coens. -- I did admire Chigurh's two philosophical remarks about the coins to be flipped.

84985,A280GY5UVUS2QH,0788882988,Doug Anderson,"[8, 15]","This film is bound to stir up some admiration from lovers of postmodern narratives and controversy from lovers of classic noir and/or western narratives because its gruff white narrator played by Tommy Lee Jones, consciously or no, begs the viewer to meditate on the veracity of all white narratives of the west where the good are usually the determined and god and nature favored white man and the bad are almost always some sin-stained other. Here that other is a Mexican sociopath,a kind of demon conjured out of the guilty conscience of the white ruler-creator, but the white ruler-creator is past his prime and his myths of the world are fading, have faded, from the scene and all that is left is sound and fury (and some signature Coen Brothers tenebrific humor).It would seem that the Coen Brothers are interested in revisioning or deconstructing the American mythos of the west as a kind of no man's land where men (white men) do battle with their own metaphysical demons/narratives. The problem is not that the sheriff of this no man's land is not a law and order man because he is that, but that hes a law and order man who thinks too much and does too little. Whats baffling and fascinating and frustrating about the film is that the gruff sheriff is just not all that interested in catching up with the villain anymore; he's just too fixated on his own conscience, and his own inability to pass judgment of any kind on any one; he knows his time, his people's time, has passed. He (instinctively, if not consciously) knows the time for white narratives/myths has passed. And a sheriff contemplating the end of his line is not a very effective enforcer of the public good. He's impotent like those wanderers in the desert of modern poetry...his only friend the end. His constant companion, his only companion, is his own mortality and the mortality of his forefathers. In an earlier generation the sherrif went out with a bang, but now he and his father just whimper on.Like the sheriff in Touch of Evil, Tommy Lee Jones instantly understands everything he sees(noir fanatics will love this sherrif), but unlike that earlier noir sheriff Tommy Lee Jones just can't muster up the courage to act. He wants very much for there to be some Ur-father or God administering some kind of metaphysical justice, but all he experiences is the absence of any such figure to grant authority to his law and his narratives, and thats what haunts his nightmare visions, a lack. And while the sheriff waxes metaphysical-existential-nihilistic-fatalistic there's no one to look out for the white man's or anyone's best interest.Its not that white people come off as the good guys here, they don't. In fact theres plenty of white men implicated in every crime. McCarthy and the Coen Brothers are careful not to portray whites as any better than the rest of humanity but what sets the whites apart is that they seem to be haunted by a nostalgia for a time when it was easier to believe in their own ability to shape myths about the land and myths about their own innate Godliness/goodness. By the time Tommy Lee Jones' generation arrives that time has long since passed away. The film is a lament for the death of white heroes/narrative(s). We root for Brolin, but we know he's doomed. Tommy Lee Jones attempts to conjure the mythic past to give him strength to endure (classic Faulkner and McCarthy stuff) but even his dreams are of waste lands populated only by desert riders.If we still believed in white mens prophecies we might be tempted into believing that the escape of badman Bardem into the light of August is meant to be prophetic, but its just blind chance, random and bland, running the show from here on.",4,Last White Narrative Standing,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,3708,"['film', 'bound', 'stir', 'up', 'admiration', 'lovers', 'postmodern', 'narratives', 'controversy', 'lovers', 'classic', 'noir', 'and/or', 'western', 'narratives', 'gruff', 'white', 'narrator', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'consciously', 'viewer', 'meditate', 'veracity', 'white', 'narratives', 'west', 'where', 'good', 'are', 'usually', 'determined', 'god', 'nature', 'favored', 'white', 'man', 'bad', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'sin-stained', 'other', 'Here', 'other', 'Mexican', 'sociopath', 'kind', 'demon', 'conjured', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'white', 'ruler-creator', 'white', 'ruler-creator', 'prime', 'myths', 'world', 'are', 'fading', 'have', 'faded', 'scene', 'left', 'sound', 'fury', 'signature', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'tenebrific', 'humor', '.It', 'would', 'seem', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'are', 'interested', 'revisioning', 'deconstructing', 'American', 'mythos', 'west', 'kind', 'man', 'land', 'where', 'men', 'white', 'men', 'do', 'battle', 'own', 'metaphysical', 'demons/narratives', 'problem', 'not', 'sheriff', 'man', 'land', 'not', 'law', 'order', 'man', 'law', 'order', 'man', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'Whats', 'baffling', 'fascinating', 'frustrating', 'film', 'gruff', 'sheriff', 'just', 'not', 'interested', 'catching', 'up', 'villain', 'anymore', 'just', 'too', 'fixated', 'own', 'conscience', 'own', 'inability', 'pass', 'judgment', 'kind', 'one', 'time', 'people', 'time', 'passed', 'instinctively', 'not', 'consciously', 'time', 'white', 'narratives/myths', 'passed', 'sheriff', 'contemplating', 'end', 'line', 'not', 'very', 'effective', 'enforcer', 'public', 'good', 'impotent', 'wanderers', 'desert', 'modern', 'poetry', 'only', 'friend', 'end', 'constant', 'companion', 'only', 'companion', 'own', 'mortality', 'mortality', 'forefathers', 'earlier', 'generation', 'sherrif', 'went', 'out', 'bang', 'now', 'father', 'just', 'whimper', 'sheriff', 'Touch', 'Evil', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'instantly', 'everything', 'noir', 'fanatics', 'will', 'love', 'sherrif', 'earlier', 'noir', 'sheriff', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'muster', 'up', 'courage', 'act', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'Ur-father', 'God', 'administering', 'kind', 'metaphysical', 'justice', 'absence', 'such', 'figure', 'grant', 'authority', 'law', 'narratives', 'thats', 'what', 'nightmare', 'visions', 'lack', 'sheriff', 'waxes', 'metaphysical-existential-nihilistic-fatalistic', 'one', 'look', 'out', 'white', 'man', 'anyone', 'best', 'interest.Its', 'not', 'white', 'people', 'come', 'off', 'good', 'guys', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'fact', 'theres', 'plenty', 'white', 'men', 'implicated', 'crime', 'McCarthy', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'are', 'careful', 'not', 'portray', 'whites', 'better', 'rest', 'humanity', 'what', 'whites', 'apart', 'seem', 'be', 'haunted', 'nostalgia', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'easier', 'believe', 'own', 'ability', 'shape', 'myths', 'land', 'myths', 'own', 'innate', 'Godliness/goodness', 'time', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'generation', 'time', 'long', 'passed', 'away', 'film', 'lament', 'death', 'white', 'heroes/narrative', 's', 'root', 'Brolin', 'know', 'doomed', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'attempts', 'conjure', 'mythic', 'past', 'give', 'strength', 'endure', 'classic', 'Faulkner', 'McCarthy', 'stuff', 'even', 'dreams', 'are', 'waste', 'lands', 'populated', 'only', 'desert', 'riders.If', 'still', 'believed', 'white', 'mens', 'prophecies', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'believing', 'escape', 'badman', 'Bardem', 'light', 'August', 'meant', 'be', 'prophetic', 'just', 'blind', 'chance', 'random', 'bland', 'running', 'show', 'here']",N/A

Set against the stark landscape of west Texas and northern Mexico, the film, the characters, and the dialog are equally stark. This is truly a minimalist film, in that there are no special effects, the characters are straightforward and not highly nuanced, and the evil that pervades the film is evident and obvious.In fact, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is the personification of an evil that is without redemptive quality. A man who kills with little or no provocation, and who does so throughout the film, Chiguhr shows absolutely no emotion at any point when he kills those who stand in his way. At no time, not even at the end, when he is seriously wounded, do emotion or remorse factor into the equation. One gets a glimpse of what evil unchecked by conscience is like.Meanwhile, those whose lives become entangled with his, while more sympathetic than Chigurh, are themselves often cruel, self-centered, and bent on their own questionable goals, though their evil is more subtle than is that of Chigurh.All in all, this may be the Coen brothers best effort.

Set in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico itself, it is a western that isn't a western; a chase film in which bad guy Anton Chigurh (Javier Badem) pursues Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), while being himself pursued by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones).  One of those chases is resolved; the other is left hanging in the air.  The film builds up a fair amount of suspense, as we wonder whether Chigurh and Bell are going to get their men, yet the Coen Brothers continually combine that suspense with an eye for telling detail, or the inclusion of quirky sequences designed to show the futility of the entire quest theme.  One of my favorite quirky sequences takes place in a dirty roadside motel, where the camera cuts to a sign outside saying (""HBO Available"").  The whole notion of cable television in this kind of motel seems particularly incongruous.  The performances are simply brilliant: Bardem doesn't have a lot to say, but communicates everything through telling glances.  By contrast Brolin seems more laid back, despite the fact that he is being continually pursued.  Jones goes through the motions of ensuring that justice should be done, but seems to be looking for a quiet life all the time.  It is significant that the dramatic tension slackens somewhat during his sequences.  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the kind of movie that befits repeated viewings in order to uncover its subtleties.

The word of the day is suspense, an emotion the brothers have excelled at in the past, and No Country is a glorious example of it at play.

In my opinion, the Coen Brother's have done this with all of their 12 films.The Coen Brothers (and Roger Deakins) have done it. No Country for Old Men IS a masterpiece. It is without question one of the most mesmerizing films I have ever watched. This seems impossible, because it is also one of the most sparse and simple films I have ever watched. However, within minutes of watching the film you will quickly realize that it is because of the films simplicity that you are hooked.I want to say something incredible about all the performances, but I would like to keep this review simple, Javier Bardem's character is all I really need to mention. Upon watching this film only a few days ago, I have heard that this film is being played in philosophy classes in at least two universities that I know about. Fate is what is being discussed. Bardem's character is at the core of this, but fate is in each frame of the film. As they have done in their very first film, ""Blood Simple"", faith becomes a character in ""No Country for Old Men"". Bardem's brilliant acting is reminiscent of Billy Bob Thorton's mysteriousness in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"".

It doesn't seem to have any sense or meaning, rhyme or reason.  It's as if the rug was suddenly pulled from underneath us during the blink of an eye, and we have no idea who did it, when, or why.  It just happens.Well, this is one of the best reasons to buy this film on DVD: if you are totally confounded and befuddled by the way it ends, in the Special Features there is one segment where the directors and several of the cast talk about the film...they pretty much tell you what it's about, which is mainly through the title, the setting (the nakedly pitiless, harsh West Texas desert), and especially the stunningly diabolical character that Javier Bardem plays (for which he won a richly deserved Oscar).  It's kind of a nice Cliff-Notes feature, really.

84996,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0788882988,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","The unpredictable storytelling route at the heart of this intensely driven and thickly plotted 2007 film is what makes the ride a fascinating, often involving one. I had never read theacclaimed 2005 novelby author Cormac McCarthy, the basis of the film, but it's obvious that the story ambiguities, philosophizing tone and eccentric side characters were key draws for the idiosyncratic Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, who again wrote and directed together as a team. Immediately familiar are the dark sensibilities that make an arid-looking West Texas a most unlikely place for a noir-type thriller, but the Coens' rich sense of character and place are certainly evident. At the same time, the relentless chase in the movie is so dominant that there is little time for them to showcase the quirky sense of humor that makes 1996'sFargoa modern classic. There are a few refreshingly amusing moments here and there, especially those involving the sheriff, but I have to admit that the lurid, heart-stopping scenes are what sear in my memory.Set around 1980 (a point that isn't that clear until there is mention of Vietnam) near the Mexican border, Llewelyn Moss is out hunting in the sagebrush and comes upon the bloody aftermath of a failed drug deal. In the back of a pickup truck are a sizable payload of heroin and two million dollars. He makes off with the money, but through an act of unexpected and belated conscience, he becomes a man on the run by a number of different parties. Chief among them is Anton Chigurh, an unconscionable hitman who escapes local police custody and closes in on Moss with unfettered conviction and unnerving calm. Surrounding both men is soon-to-retire Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, whose county is where the initial crime scene occurs. The characters' fates collide as the plot twists and turns, but the focus becomes less on the storyline and more on how they bring on their own dire situations through their own machinations. Given how the Coens end the movie (which apparently mirrors McCarthy's book) and some holes in the plot, the movie gains its emotional resonance as a tale of self-accountability.The performances of the three leads are excellent. Sporting a hideous mop-top haircut, the versatile Javier Bardem (Before Night Falls,The Sea Inside) manages to play Chigurh as the heartless killer he is by emphasizing the warped sense of honor that makes his acts reasonable to him. His manner is so discomforting that I was conflicted as to whether I should cringe vulnerably or avert my eyes entirely every time Chigurh shows up on the screen. Cast perfectly to type as the laconic Bell, Tommy Lee Jones is an assuring presence despite the drug-trading malevolence engulfing his territory, a development that makes his character realize that he has become a man out of his time (thus the movie's title). Usually a journeyman actor (with a famous wife, Diane Lane, and an even more famousmother-in-law), Josh Brolin (Hollow Man) conveys the precarious balance between opportunistic and decent with minimum fuss. As his worried wife Clara Jean, Kelly MacDonald has just a few effective scenes, and her final one attains a becalming power. The only fly in the ointment is Woody Harrelson, just too familiar a presence to be entirely convincing as a talkative bounty hunter who would be a compelling match for Chigurh. Of special note is the masterful cinematography by Roger Deakins, a past veteran of the Coen's films, which perfectly captures the rural setting.",4,Heart-stopping Chase Drama Inhabited by Lived-In Characters and a Plot  Focused on Accountability,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,3494,"['unpredictable', 'storytelling', 'route', 'heart', 'intensely', 'driven', 'thickly', 'plotted', '2007', 'film', 'what', 'ride', 'fascinating', 'often', 'involving', 'one', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'theacclaimed', '2005', 'novelby', 'author', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'basis', 'film', 'obvious', 'story', 'ambiguities', 'philosophizing', 'tone', 'eccentric', 'side', 'characters', 'were', 'key', 'draws', 'idiosyncratic', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'Ethan', 'Joel', 'who', 'again', 'wrote', 'directed', 'together', 'team', 'Immediately', 'familiar', 'are', 'dark', 'sensibilities', 'make', 'arid-looking', 'West', 'Texas', 'most', 'unlikely', 'place', 'noir-type', 'thriller', 'Coens', 'rich', 'sense', 'character', 'place', 'are', 'certainly', 'evident', 'same', 'time', 'relentless', 'chase', 'movie', 'so', 'dominant', 'little', 'time', 'showcase', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', ""1996'sFargoa"", 'modern', 'classic', 'are', 'few', 'refreshingly', 'amusing', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'especially', 'involving', 'sheriff', 'have', 'admit', 'lurid', 'heart-stopping', 'scenes', 'are', 'what', 'sear', 'memory.Set', '1980', 'point', ""n't"", 'clear', 'mention', 'Vietnam', 'Mexican', 'border', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'out', 'hunting', 'sagebrush', 'bloody', 'aftermath', 'failed', 'drug', 'deal', 'back', 'pickup', 'truck', 'are', 'sizable', 'payload', 'heroin', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'money', 'act', 'unexpected', 'belated', 'conscience', 'man', 'run', 'number', 'different', 'parties', 'Chief', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'unconscionable', 'hitman', 'who', 'local', 'police', 'custody', 'closes', 'Moss', 'unfettered', 'conviction', 'unnerving', 'calm', 'Surrounding', 'men', 'soon-to-retire', 'Sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'county', 'where', 'initial', 'crime', 'scene', 'characters', 'fates', 'collide', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'focus', 'less', 'storyline', 'more', 'how', 'bring', 'own', 'dire', 'situations', 'own', 'machinations', 'Given', 'how', 'Coens', 'end', 'movie', 'apparently', 'McCarthy', 'book', 'holes', 'plot', 'movie', 'gains', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'tale', 'self-accountability.The', 'performances', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'excellent', 'Sporting', 'hideous', 'mop-top', 'haircut', 'versatile', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Night', 'Falls', 'Sea', 'Inside', 'play', 'Chigurh', 'heartless', 'killer', 'emphasizing', 'warped', 'sense', 'honor', 'acts', 'reasonable', 'manner', 'so', 'discomforting', 'was', 'conflicted', 'should', 'cringe', 'vulnerably', 'avert', 'eyes', 'entirely', 'time', 'Chigurh', 'up', 'screen', 'Cast', 'perfectly', 'type', 'laconic', 'Bell', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'assuring', 'presence', 'drug-trading', 'malevolence', 'engulfing', 'territory', 'development', 'character', 'realize', 'become', 'man', 'time', 'thus', 'movie', 'title', 'Usually', 'journeyman', 'actor', 'famous', 'wife', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'even', 'more', 'famousmother-in-law', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'precarious', 'balance', 'opportunistic', 'decent', 'minimum', 'fuss', 'worried', 'wife', 'Clara', 'Jean', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'just', 'few', 'effective', 'scenes', 'final', 'one', 'becalming', 'power', 'only', 'fly', 'ointment', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'just', 'too', 'familiar', 'presence', 'be', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'talkative', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'compelling', 'match', 'Chigurh', 'special', 'note', 'masterful', 'cinematography', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'past', 'veteran', 'Coen', 'films', 'perfectly', 'rural', 'setting']",N/A

It has quickly become one of my favorite suspense films after a second viewing. I especially got a kick at all of the symbolic visuals and dialogue that are very significant especially in modern society; this is one of the few films of 2007 that really makes us think. It almost acts as a film by Stanley Kubrick, because it's so distinctive and different from many films made in 2007.Some people (teens in particular) may find themselves hating this film because it has a very ponderous pace and an anticlimactic ending. Well, these two things didn't bother me. They fit very well in this movie. The slow flow of the film adds to the suspense between the three major characters: Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Lee Jones), Anton Chigurh (Bardem), and Llewelyn Moss (Brolin). All three never actually meet each other in person, but each play the most significant roles in the film. Chigurh is not your typical antagonist: he knows how to get what he wants. His biggest challenge, however, is recovering a suitcase of two million dollars from animal hunter Moss. Moss decides to keep the money, but many catastrophic things happen as Chigurh ever comes closer to what he desires. Ed Tom Bell is what you call the ""bystander,"" in which he becomes part of the investigation and comments on what has just happened in front of him.I'm not particulary interested in the works by the Coen Brothers, but this, along with Fargo, is the best that I've seen from the two. The acting is perfect (Bardem as Chigurh still scares me after repeated vieweings), the pacing is perfect (sometimes slow is good), and the very minimal use of music is quite effective. The blood and gore is rather heavy in some parts, so you have been warned. It's now one of my top favorite films (alongside The Godfather Saga, Burton's 1989 Batman, every Kubrick flim that's ever made, and so much more).Grade: A+",5,"""What's the most you ever lost in a coin toss?""",1239667200,"04 14, 2009",2009,1948,"['Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'deserved', 'oscars', 'Best', 'Director', 's', 'Best', 'Picture', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'suspense', 'films', 'second', 'viewing', 'especially', 'got', 'kick', 'symbolic', 'visuals', 'dialogue', 'are', 'very', 'significant', 'especially', 'modern', 'society', 'one', 'few', 'films', '2007', 'really', 'think', 'almost', 'film', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'so', 'distinctive', 'different', 'many', 'films', 'made', '2007.Some', 'people', 'teens', 'particular', 'may', 'find', 'hating', 'film', 'very', 'ponderous', 'pace', 'anticlimactic', 'ending', 'Well', 'two', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'slow', 'flow', 'film', 'suspense', 'three', 'major', 'characters', 'Sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'Bardem', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Brolin', 'three', 'never', 'actually', 'meet', 'other', 'person', 'play', 'most', 'significant', 'roles', 'film', 'Chigurh', 'not', 'typical', 'antagonist', 'how', 'get', 'what', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'however', 'recovering', 'suitcase', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'animal', 'hunter', 'Moss', 'Moss', 'keep', 'money', 'many', 'catastrophic', 'things', 'happen', 'Chigurh', 'ever', 'closer', 'what', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'what', 'call', 'bystander', 'part', 'investigation', 'comments', 'just', 'happened', 'front', 'him.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'particulary', 'interested', 'works', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Fargo', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'acting', 'perfect', 'Bardem', 'Chigurh', 'still', 'repeated', 'vieweings', 'pacing', 'perfect', 'sometimes', 'slow', 'good', 'very', 'minimal', 'use', 'music', 'quite', 'effective', 'blood', 'gore', 'rather', 'heavy', 'parts', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'now', 'one', 'top', 'favorite', 'films', 'Godfather', 'Saga', 'Burton', '1989', 'Batman', 'Kubrick', 'flim', 'ever', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'more', '.Grade', 'A+']",N/A
85004,A1CHM200OEN65X,0788882988,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[15, 29]","I wanted to love this movie. The book is incredible, and I'm a big fan of other tawdry, dark affairs, such as ""Fight Club"" and ""Seven."" I think the Coen Brothers' ""Fargo"" still holds up. As this movie progressed, I found myself swept up in the drama of these characters and in the gorgeous photography.The movie revolves around a narcotics deal gone bad, in which a number of Mexican hombres have been slaughtered. (Apparently, one guy tried to steal the cash and single-handedly took on a mob...Only the first in a number of implausibilities.) A man out hunting comes across the scene, and ends up tracking down the now-dead-man with the money. Thankfully, he's dumb enough not to switch out the money into another container (you know, to avoid being detected by those who might want their two million dollars), thus allowing the cold-blooded killer to locate him by use of a hidden transmitter, leading to lots of conflict.Up to this point, I was still willing to overlook the inconsistencies, almost all of which were the movie's deviations from the book. I was completely intrigued by the killer and his prey. Tommy Lee Jones plays the usual part of a sheriff--and does a superb job--but his character has been worn thin by a world that's turned ugly around him, and he seems to really have no desire to pursue the killers and bring justice. He's just too tired of it all.There are numerous elements that work brilliantly--the acting, the scenery, the dialogue. And yet, the movie falls under the weight of its own pretention. In trying to avoid the cliches of a traditional ending, it avoids almost all logic. It underwrites almost every preceding scene by giving no resolution, whereas the novel allows the reader a bit more insight. Even worse, in retrospect, many of those heart-pounding scenes become nonsensical: hotel room shoot-ups that attract no police till too late; money hidden within a stone's throw of border towers that is later picked up without a question; and a man who seems to outrun a truck of armed bandits until the break of dawn (again, another break from the book).I was willing to overlook all the implausibilities until the abrupt ending refused to give even a nihilistic resolution. Shouldn't we be given a definitive end to one of the central character's, for example? At least a peak at the corpse? I understand that this was part of Cormac McCarthy's point in the story, this lack of resolution, of tidiness, but he gave us clues in the book to put the pieces toegether. He gave more time to the sheriff's character. In the film, the lack of depth seems to underline the cowardice of Jones' character. In the face of a world gone bad, do we just cower in the corner and assume that nothing will ever work out, that there will never be resolution?

Along the way, the filmmakers get to show lots of senseless violence in all it's gory glory... and we the audience have to deal with it.  This is no film for old men.Yes, the film is superbly crafted and compelling to watch.  The characters are finely drawn.  The acting is top-notch.  The cinematography is awesome.  And the action and suspense are completely engrossing.  In short, this is a significant filmmaking achievement.  But did it have to be in service to such a nihilistic message?I don't see films for a living; I see them for entertainment.  Personally, I don't find graphic violence entertaining.  But if it furthers the story line, it makes sense.  In this film, it is the other way around: the story line is weak, and exists only to display the violence.The plot starts off promising: renegade cowboy type finds pile of cash from drug deal gone bad and tries to make off with it while tracked by cold-blooded drug boss type.  Crusty old sheriff (the inimitable Tommy Lee Jones) is hot on the trail.  But this is not ""The Fugitive"", where the action builds to a thrilling climax.  Here the story falls apart, becoming drunk on an orgy of violent scenes, until it has nowhere to go.  The film ends with the story line unresolved.

85008,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,0788882988,e. verrillo,"[33, 73]","This is not only the worst Coen Brothers film I've seen, it's one of the worst films I've seen, period. Bad writing, bad editing, bad concept, bad acting, bad everything. It was a film that defied logic, that not only asked you to suspend disbelief (they all do that), but to suspend any grain of intelligence you might possess.To start with, our main character, Llewelyn, a down and out Vietnam vet, is unbelievably dumb. Who in their right mind would take $2,000,000 from the scene of a drug shootout (lots of dead bodies) and then return a few hours later? With his car? Registered in his name? Naturally, the drug cartel has noticed that some money is missing, and they've returned as well. This starts a chase. Llewelyn doesn't get any smarter as he's being hunted. He's running all over Texas with a satchel of money, which, of course has a transponder in it. A homicidal maniac whose motives are entirely unclear, but who is somehow connected to the drug cartel, tracks the bug. Eventually, after being found over and over again, it occurs to Llewelyn to search the satchel for a tracking device. But his stupidity does not cease with the monumental realization that technology exists. Llewelyn sends his wife to her mother's house, guessing that nobody would be able to track her at Mom's (of all places!). Then he takes off to a motel, figuring pretty much the same thing. Meanwhile, EVERYBODY on earth seems to know, within seconds, every step he takes: the cops, the drug runners, the homicidal maniac, even Woody Harrelson (who appears in two scenes--the first in which he's hired by some guy in an office to track down Llewelyn, and the second in which he gets shot by the homicidal maniac, who at this point has shot so many people you'll need an abacus). How everyone manages to figure which hospital Llewelyn's gone to (Mexico is a big place), which hotel he's in (Texas is a big place), and where he's going to appear next, remains a mystery, because the cops don't do any cop-like things (forensics, finger-printing) and the homicidal maniac doesn't appear to do any sort of research. The illogical ease with which everyone under the sun can locate Llewelyn is only matched by the difficulty of finding a homicidal maniac who shoots lots and lots of people in broad daylight, and in public places, because they've ""seen"" him. (Does that also include gas station attendants? Waitresses? Check-out girls at the grocery? Fry-cooks? People who walk by him on the street?) Seriously.In the end we're supposed to be left with a message, which I won't spoil for you. In any event, you can't miss it because it is rammed home several times by Tommy Lee Jones, the disillusioned cop who doesn't understand anything. And says so. Constantly. (Tommy Lee Jones gives a dispirited, lackluster performance, but with the lines he was forced to deliver, nobody can blame him.) The final sequence in which Jones recounts a long dream to his wife, which I gather was supposed to symbolically wrap things up, was just as pointless, inconsequential and irrelevant as the rest of the movie. But, on the bright side--there was lots of blood. Gratuitous violence is sure to get any film an Academy Award or four.

Josh Brolin plays a young Vietnam vet, Llewellyn Moss, who has come home to his Texas bordertown with no prospects, and on a hunting trip accidently stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal that no one survived. He abstains from involving himself with the huge drug haul, ill-concealed under tarps on the back of a truck, but does avail himself of the considerable stash of cash held in a valise by one of the dead dealers. Upon picking it up, he unwittingly draws the single-minded attention of the owner of the cash, chief bad guy, Anton Chigurh (chillingly played by Javier Bardem), who tracks his quarry with such dedication and coldness that I am still scared by this man. Chigurh apparently never met anybody he didn't kill. Also in this movie, but seen woefully infrequently, is Tommy Lee Jones, playing Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. He is a sort of male counterpart of the character Frances McDormand played in ""Fargo"" - another Coen Brothers movie - a man of few words, who works and worries his cases like a dog with a very good bone and who tells Llewellyn's wife that, in essence, no outcome is guaranteed, which I think is the moral of the movie. There is rampant bloodshed and innocent bystanders galore as Llewellyn tries desperately to keep one step ahead of a relentless Chigurh.This does not have the snappy ending of other Coen offerings, and some people around me were put off by it, but the more I considered the overall consequences to those involved, the more sense it made to me. You can't count on pat answers or neat endings all the time; life isn't like that. Not everyone gets what they deserve, but who said life was fair?I have never found a film with Tommy Lee Jones in it that was disappointing to me, and Josh Brolin is shaping into a really great actor. Javier Bardem plays evil, as I said, so well that if I saw him on the street I'd move out of state; his character is clearly crazy, yet also a man with his own twisted set of principles. Interesting choice of weapons, also, as he carts around an air tank and hose with considerably more punch than the OSHA regulatory 30 pounds of pressure.Not a movie for those who are squeamish about blood and violence, but a first-rate nailbiter with intelligent dialog and storyline.",5,Beware of ill-gotten gains,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,2367,"['Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'have', 'gotten', 'good', 'portraying', 'irredeemably', 'evil', 'pitted', 'hopelessly', 'outclassed', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'young', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'Llewellyn', 'Moss', 'who', 'come', 'home', 'Texas', 'bordertown', 'prospects', 'hunting', 'trip', 'accidently', 'aftermath', 'drug', 'deal', 'one', 'survived', 'involving', 'huge', 'drug', 'haul', 'ill-concealed', 'tarps', 'back', 'truck', 'avail', 'considerable', 'stash', 'cash', 'held', 'valise', 'one', 'dead', 'dealers', 'picking', 'up', 'unwittingly', 'single-minded', 'attention', 'owner', 'cash', 'chief', 'bad', 'guy', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'chillingly', 'played', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'quarry', 'such', 'dedication', 'coldness', 'am', 'still', 'scared', 'man', 'Chigurh', 'apparently', 'never', 'met', 'anybody', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Also', 'movie', 'seen', 'woefully', 'infrequently', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'playing', 'Sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'sort', 'male', 'counterpart', 'character', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'played', 'Fargo', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'who', 'cases', 'dog', 'very', 'good', 'bone', 'who', 'tells', 'Llewellyn', 'wife', 'essence', 'outcome', 'guaranteed', 'think', 'moral', 'movie', 'rampant', 'bloodshed', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'galore', 'Llewellyn', 'desperately', 'keep', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'relentless', 'Chigurh.This', 'not', 'have', 'snappy', 'ending', 'other', 'Coen', 'offerings', 'people', 'were', 'put', 'off', 'more', 'considered', 'overall', 'consequences', 'involved', 'more', 'sense', 'made', 'ca', ""n't"", 'count', 'pat', 'answers', 'neat', 'endings', 'time', 'life', ""n't"", 'Not', 'everyone', 'what', 'deserve', 'who', 'said', 'life', 'was', 'fair', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'film', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'was', 'disappointing', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'shaping', 'really', 'great', 'actor', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'evil', 'said', 'so', 'well', 'saw', 'street', ""'d"", 'move', 'out', 'state', 'character', 'clearly', 'crazy', 'yet', 'also', 'man', 'own', 'twisted', 'set', 'principles', 'Interesting', 'choice', 'weapons', 'also', 'air', 'tank', 'hose', 'considerably', 'more', 'punch', 'OSHA', 'regulatory', '30', 'pounds', 'pressure.Not', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'squeamish', 'blood', 'violence', 'first-rate', 'nailbiter', 'intelligent', 'dialog', 'storyline']",N/A

This is no exception and is just another classic in a long list of classics, both theatrically and on DVD this is a brilliant film. I can honestly say that a lot of the time I do not agree with the winners or even the nominees chosen by the Academy for the Oscar but they got it right with this one. By the way I do not care what people think, that ending was BRILLIANT.The story is all about Llewelyn Moss [Josh Brolin] a normal every day guy who happens to stumble upon something he should not have. When he comes across a massacre and ends up leaving the area with a bag full of money a killer [Javier Bardem] comes after him and one of the best movies ever made starts to unfold. Add in a sheriff who is trying to put this all together played by Tommy Lee Jones and another hired hand played by Woody Harrelson and you have one great scenario taking place. This movie has every thong you could want in a film, there is some good humor although it is on the darker side. There is also not only some good action going on but a really dramatic tale of greed. Don't let any one tell you differently this movie is all about greed and obsession. One mans combo of the two leaves not only him but his family in danger that may even lead to death. Another's combo of the two leads him down the same path while another's completely breaks him. It may seem confusing reading this but when you watch it you will get it, and dare I say you will enjoy it.Writers/directors/producers Coen Brothers have crafted one of the best films to come out in years. The direction of this film can be felt threw out the entire thing and the screenplay is amazing. This could be the best film the two have put together and that is really saying something, come on just think of what these two have made. Acting wise this film shines just as much as Josh Brolin gives one of the best performances of his career. I was really rooting for this guy during this movie even though he brings it all on himself, but man does he give Bardem's character a run for his money. Woody Harrelson is just as good in this film as a hired hand trying to get the money back for his employer. He really shines with his sense of humor in this film and the way he carries himself. Tommy Lee Jones as usual is great as the sheriff who is determined to find his man, so much so that it brings him down. It is somewhat disappointing knowing about the drama going on between him and the studio about this film, mainly because he may never work with the Coen Brothers again. But aside from that we have what has got to be one of the greatest performances in cinematic history, and I am serious when I say that. Javier Bardem turned in one of the best performances I have ever seen, really brought to life one of the most interesting characters I have had the pleasure of viewing.This film is definitely worth your money, I say buy this not rent it. I hear people complain about the ending of this film all the time and I don't understand why. I thought that it was one of the most brilliant endings in a long time; I never thought it would end like that. Maybe because it isn't what would be considered a typical ending people hated on it, but I think that it what makes it so good. I loved it and so did my brother who watched it with me, at least one person agreed with me on that ending.",5,WHAT A GREAT ENDING,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,3507,"['COUNTRY', 'FOR', 'OLD', 'MENI', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'two', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'exception', 'just', 'classic', 'long', 'list', 'classics', 'theatrically', 'DVD', 'brilliant', 'film', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'lot', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'winners', 'even', 'nominees', 'chosen', 'Academy', 'Oscar', 'got', 'right', 'one', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'ending', 'was', 'BRILLIANT.The', 'story', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', '[', 'Josh', 'Brolin', ']', 'normal', 'day', 'guy', 'who', 'stumble', 'something', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'When', 'massacre', 'up', 'leaving', 'area', 'bag', 'full', 'money', 'killer', '[', 'Javier', 'Bardem', ']', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'starts', 'unfold', 'Add', 'sheriff', 'who', 'trying', 'put', 'together', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'hired', 'hand', 'played', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'have', 'one', 'great', 'scenario', 'taking', 'place', 'movie', 'thong', 'could', 'want', 'film', 'good', 'humor', 'darker', 'side', 'also', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'action', 'going', 'really', 'dramatic', 'tale', 'greed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'one', 'tell', 'differently', 'movie', 'greed', 'obsession', 'One', 'combo', 'two', 'leaves', 'not', 'only', 'family', 'danger', 'may', 'even', 'lead', 'death', 'combo', 'two', 'down', 'same', 'path', 'completely', 'may', 'seem', 'confusing', 'reading', 'when', 'watch', 'will', 'get', 'dare', 'say', 'will', 'enjoy', 'it.Writers/directors/producers', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'crafted', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'years', 'direction', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'entire', 'thing', 'screenplay', 'amazing', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'two', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'really', 'saying', 'something', 'come', 'just', 'think', 'what', 'two', 'have', 'made', 'Acting', 'wise', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'was', 'really', 'rooting', 'guy', 'movie', 'even', 'man', 'give', 'Bardem', 'character', 'run', 'money', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'hired', 'hand', 'trying', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'employer', 'really', 'sense', 'humor', 'film', 'way', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'usual', 'great', 'sheriff', 'who', 'determined', 'find', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'down', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'knowing', 'drama', 'going', 'studio', 'film', 'mainly', 'may', 'never', 'work', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'again', 'aside', 'have', 'what', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'cinematic', 'history', 'am', 'serious', 'when', 'say', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'turned', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'really', 'brought', 'life', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'money', 'say', 'buy', 'not', 'rent', 'hear', 'people', 'complain', 'ending', 'film', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'endings', 'long', 'time', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'end', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'what', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'typical', 'ending', 'people', 'hated', 'think', 'so', 'good', 'loved', 'so', 'did', 'brother', 'who', 'watched', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'agreed', 'ending']",N/A
85018,AJ46ZEGKZZD54,0788882988,Frank Bellizzi,"[1, 1]","Wow. . . . Directors Joel and Ethan Coen out-did themselves with this bleak dream of a film, both heart-pounding and heart-breaking.(Spoiler Alert!) It all begins when Llewelyen Moss (Josh Brolin), a Vietnam vet and ordinary Joe who lives in Southwest Texas, goes hunting and discovers the grisly scene of a drug deal gone bad. His life changes when he spots in the distance the corpse of the man who'd been trying to make off with the loot, $2 million in cash neatly stacked in a big black case.Not much later, Llewelyen has taken the money, been spotted by men who know that he has it, and realizes that it won't be long before someone comes knocking at his door. From there, the movie turns into an far-flung chase that involves the three main characters: Moss, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones), and the psychopathic arch criminal Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem).For those who haven't seen it, I'll tell you that this movie is not for the faint of heart. It's certainly not a pick-me-up. But that's putting it mildly. At the same time, the film includes a big dose of the quirky dark humor that we've come to expect from the Coen brothers.Most of the on-line reviews I've read suggest that one of the main themes of No Country For Old Men is the then-recent explosion of violent crime in the U.S. The story is set in 1980, ironically the year that the always-hopeful Ronald Reagan was first elected President. In a telling scene, both Sheriff Bell and one of his colleagues seem to think that it's gotten a lot worse since those earlier, better days when they were younger men. Now old men, these veterans of law enforcement feel lost in a wasteland of absolute disregard and brutality. As Bell says it in the opening voice over,""The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job - not to be glorious. But I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. You can say it's my job to fight it, but I don't know what it is anymore. More than that, I don't want to know. A man would have to put his soul at hazard. He would have to say, 'O.K., I'll be part of this world.' ""Near the end of the movie, the recently-retired Sheriff Bell, feeling ""outmatched,"" goes to visit his Uncle Ellis, a crusty old former lawman, now disabled. To me, this was the pivotal scene. Ellis tells his nephew, ""Whatcha got ain't nothin new."" The depth of evil that Ed Tom Bell has recently come to see? It didn't just arrive. It's not unprecedented. In fact, it can be found throughout human history.""There is nothing new under the sun,"" said a wise man. And that includes the mind-numbing violence depicted in this movie. As much as we're impressed, rightly so, by the evil of our own day, the broad sweep of history, written in blood, tells us that the old uncle is right.In the closing scene, the newly-retired Sheriff Bell seems completely dejected. He tells his wife about a couple of dreams he'd had the night before. In the first, he had lost some money that his father (also a career lawman) had given him. Here, Bell gives voice to the the haunting fears of people who live with a legacy, people who stand in a great tradition. ""Will I be so weak that I'll fumble and forfeit what others have worked so hard to earn?""In the second dream, father and son are riding horseback through the snow. The father passes, holding a lit torch. He'll set up a campsite and build a fire up ahead. Eventually, the son will meet the father there.Will that be a time when Bell has to give an account for what he did, who he was? Maybe that's the idea. Either way, by now the viewer is convinced that in spite of his confusion and doubt, the good sheriff would do well in any such judgment. Besides, he would be with his father, the one who had gone ahead and prepared a place for the two of them.Could a dream like that be interpreted as a longing for restoration and never-ending relationship? That's the way I see it. In spite of the presence of real evil, people live with the hope that we were not meant to age and die in a world like that. Instead, we want to keep going with an expectation that we will eventually meet and live with our maker.",5,Realism and Hope in a World Filled with Evil,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,4276,"['Wow', 'Directors', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'out-did', 'bleak', 'dream', 'film', 'heart-pounding', 'heart-breaking', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'when', 'Llewelyen', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'ordinary', 'Joe', 'who', 'Southwest', 'Texas', 'hunting', 'grisly', 'scene', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', 'life', 'changes', 'when', 'distance', 'corpse', 'man', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'trying', 'make', 'off', 'loot', '2', 'million', 'cash', 'neatly', 'stacked', 'big', 'black', 'case.Not', 'much', 'later', 'Llewelyen', 'taken', 'money', 'been', 'spotted', 'men', 'who', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'long', 'someone', 'knocking', 'door', 'there', 'movie', 'far-flung', 'chase', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Moss', 'Sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'psychopathic', 'arch', 'criminal', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'Javier', 'Bardem', '.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'movie', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'certainly', 'not', 'pick-me-up', 'putting', 'mildly', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'big', 'dose', 'quirky', 'dark', 'humor', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Coen', 'brothers.Most', 'on-line', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'suggest', 'one', 'main', 'themes', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'then-recent', 'explosion', 'violent', 'crime', 'U.S', 'story', 'set', '1980', 'ironically', 'year', 'always-hopeful', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'was', 'first', 'elected', 'President', 'telling', 'scene', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'one', 'colleagues', 'seem', 'think', 'gotten', 'lot', 'worse', 'earlier', 'better', 'days', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'men', 'Now', 'old', 'men', 'veterans', 'law', 'enforcement', 'feel', 'lost', 'wasteland', 'absolute', 'disregard', 'brutality', 'Bell', 'opening', 'voice', 'crime', 'see', 'now', 'hard', 'even', 'take', 'measure', 'not', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'always', 'knew', 'had', 'be', 'willing', 'die', 'even', 'do', 'job', 'not', 'be', 'glorious', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'push', 'chips', 'forward', 'go', 'out', 'meet', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'can', 'say', 'job', 'fight', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'anymore', 'More', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'soul', 'hazard', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'O.K.', ""'ll"", 'be', 'part', 'world', 'end', 'movie', 'recently-retired', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'feeling', 'outmatched', 'visit', 'Uncle', 'Ellis', 'crusty', 'old', 'former', 'lawman', 'now', 'disabled', 'was', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'Ellis', 'nephew', 'Whatcha', 'got', 'ai', ""n't"", 'nothin', 'new', 'depth', 'evil', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'recently', 'come', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'arrive', 'not', 'unprecedented', 'fact', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'human', 'history', 'nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'said', 'wise', 'man', 'mind-numbing', 'violence', 'depicted', 'movie', 'As', 'much', ""'re"", 'impressed', 'rightly', 'so', 'evil', 'own', 'day', 'broad', 'sweep', 'history', 'written', 'blood', 'old', 'uncle', 'right.In', 'closing', 'scene', 'newly-retired', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'completely', 'dejected', 'wife', 'couple', 'dreams', ""'d"", 'had', 'night', 'before', 'first', 'had', 'lost', 'money', 'father', 'also', 'career', 'lawman', 'had', 'given', 'Here', 'Bell', 'voice', 'haunting', 'fears', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'legacy', 'people', 'who', 'stand', 'great', 'tradition', 'Will', 'be', 'so', 'weak', ""'ll"", 'fumble', 'forfeit', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'earn', 'second', 'dream', 'father', 'son', 'are', 'riding', 'horseback', 'snow', 'father', 'holding', 'lit', 'torch', ""'ll"", 'set', 'up', 'campsite', 'build', 'fire', 'up', 'ahead', 'Eventually', 'son', 'will', 'meet', 'father', 'there.Will', 'be', 'time', 'when', 'Bell', 'give', 'account', 'what', 'did', 'who', 'was', 'Maybe', 'idea', 'way', 'now', 'viewer', 'convinced', 'spite', 'confusion', 'doubt', 'good', 'sheriff', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'such', 'judgment', 'would', 'be', 'father', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'gone', 'ahead', 'prepared', 'place', 'two', 'them.Could', 'dream', 'be', 'interpreted', 'longing', 'restoration', 'never-ending', 'relationship', 'way', 'see', 'spite', 'presence', 'real', 'evil', 'people', 'live', 'hope', 'were', 'not', 'meant', 'age', 'die', 'world', 'Instead', 'want', 'keep', 'going', 'expectation', 'will', 'eventually', 'meet', 'live', 'maker']",N/A

85022,A2BPDFR58H9575,0788882988,Galina,"[5, 7]","""No Country for Old Men"" is a typical in the good sense Brothers Coens' film. In their new Crime /Drama / Western/Thriller, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same title, Coens explore the subject they seem to be very interested in: the crime gone wrong, the temptations it promises, and how it involves and affects the basically good and decent people who suddenly find themselves running for their very lives with death just one step behind or even closer. It is bloody, gripping, extremely atmospheric, darker then dark, with the tension that makes your anticipation of the horrible things to happen even stronger than actually watching these things happen, and with typical for Coens humor that they find in the darkest places. If anything, the movie introduces the evil of such quiet, demented, determined, and meticulously deadly force in the character of Anton Chigurh in the performance of life time by Javier Bardem that it will set the new standards of the screen villain from now on. Bardem plays ruthless, slow speaking, coin tossing hit man who would always finish his job, keep his word, and follow his own twisted code of ethics. His favorite killing weapon is a pneumatic air gun and I am not sure when I was scared more, when Bardem used his weapon or when he politely talked and smiled with that blood freezing smile of his. I will be very surprised if Bardem does not receive the Oscar for his performance.The film has infuriated almost as many viewers as it has satisfied with the unorthodox road it took somewhere 30 minutes before the ending. I can only say, if you want a nice and neatly wrapped up cool little thriller, go and see a Hollywood movie. ""No Country for Old Men"" is no country for predictable but if you want to see a movie you would not be able to stop thinking about way after it's over and you'd keep playing it in your head over and over, and wouldn't shake off its atmosphere, and couldn't forget its characters, go and see ""No Country for Old Men - you may find yourself at home in that country of film-making.4.5/5",4,"""Just how dangerous is he?"" - ""Compared to what?

Well, I was born in Fargo and my sister told me that I just had to see the film. She said the people in it were just exactly like the people in that part of North Dakota. It was true. Remarkable! Well, this movie is much the same way except the local is West Texas and the bordering part of Mexico. The Coen Brothers have an amazing talent for depicting the background people. I feel like they're a part of the countryside, not characters in a movie. It was just exceptional acting on the parts of very small bit players that gives the whole movie a ring of authenticity. You feel like you're there! The same could be said for the photography. Really splendid!The story was the tale of a big drug deal gone bad. Jones discovered the site while deer hunting. A group of pickup trucks were all shot up, about a half-dozen bodies littered the landscape and even the dogs were shot. One survivor in a pickup could only utter ""agua."" Jones followed a blood-dripped trail away from the scene and discovered another body with a small luggage bag full of neatly stacked and bound 100 dollar bills. He opted to take the money, an understandable but bad decision on his part as the bag also contained a small radio location device that enabled tracking. Well, one of the drug gang (Bardem) was on track of the money and a sheriff (Brolin) was on track of him. Bardem played an absolutely ruthless psychopathic killer who had absolutely no respect for any kind of life. ""Would you like to flip for it?"" he'd ask one of his victims. Heads or tails would decide life or death. I lost track of the body count laid down by this guy about half way through the movie.In any case, the movie was dreary but extremely well done. It's Academy Award stuff, without question, but I often end up disliking some award winners and this might well be one of them. It's just a dreary, totally pessimistic movie. If this is your type of entertainment, well, this is a good one.Gary Peterson",5,Exceptionally Well Done Movie. Dreary. Violent.

85024,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,0788882988,General Zombie,"[1, 3]","With ""No Country For Old Men"" the Coen brothers finally craft a classic for the 00s to match their top contributions to prior decades. (""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo,"" natch.) Though the Coens' films have largely managed to entertain over the past 13 years, the post-""Fargo"" era has virtually never achieved the manic brilliance of their first dozen years, and the Coens have inched closer towards becoming the sort of artists that their early critics always claimed they were. (All flash and irony, no humanity.) Interestingly enough, the notoriously idiosyncratic frauteurs revived their stalling careers by saddling their own tendencies and faithfully recreating the work of another prominent artist. This is not to say the Coens have totally excised their own sensibilities, but they have nevertheless produced a work that is impressively faithful to Cormac McCarthy's driven, brutal novel. Though it is impossible to translate McCarthy's florid, allusive prose to the screen, this cinematic adaptation still mirrors the emphasis on texture found therein, and contains as controlled and deliberate a visual style as any thriller. Make no mistake, though few will deny that ""No Country For Old Men"" displays greater philosophical depth than the average thriller, it is on the purely dramatic level that the film most shines. In short, this is perhaps the best thriller of the past decade, and mandatory viewing for anyone evenly remotely interested in film.Like many classically styled thrillers, ""No Country For Old Men"" opens with a fairly straightforward premise which is steadily complicated: Shortly after discovering the murderous capabilities of the enigmatic mercenary Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), we are introduced to Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) a Texan good ol' boy who stumbles on a cache of heroin along with nearly $2,000,000 from a drug deal turned bloodbath. After absconding with the cash, however, Moss's guilty conscience causes him to return to the scene to assist a dying man, where he is assailed by some cartel members. With his identity uncovered, Moss must leave behind his young wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) and flee with both the cartels and the mysterious Chigurh on his trail, while the local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempts to neutralize the situation before more blood is shed.Put crassly, ""No Country For Old Men"" plays as a combination of ""The Terminator"" and ""A Simple Plan."" The former comparison is particularly apt, as Chigurh is effectively a high-lit T-800. Though human, of course, Chigurh displays no more humanity than Schwarzenegger's machine, and is instead a being of pure will and self-preservation, a self-styled over-man. Bardem's killer is not as philosophical as the novel's version (the speeches are too long for film), but Bardem nevertheless translates the peculiarly surreal, unbelievable character to the physical realm impressively. He doesn't quite look like the literary Chigurh (who is described as vaguely foreign with blue eyes, I think), but who could? Bardem's turn is, naturally, somewhat stiff, but he works through subtle expressions and eye movements, imbuing the character with subtle yet pure malevolence. As good as Bardem is, however, Josh Brolin is better. One relative weakness of the novel was my indifference towards Moss, but Brolin injects the somewhat thinly written character with real humanity and an endearing, simple sense of humor, along with a cunning, quick-witted intelligence rare to rural film characters. Tommy Lee Jones is relative a low point. He's solid, but seems a little more foolish and less dignified than was the novel's Bell, somewhat reflecting the Coens' typical portrayal of small town characters. Finally, in smaller roles we have solid turns from Kelly Macdonald as Moss's sweet but dim wife and Woody Harrelson as an overly cocky colonel-turned-mercenary. (I was skeptical about Harrelson, but he pulls the small role off impressively.)All that said, the camera is the film's true star. ""No Country For Old Men"" is as purely visual as post-silent films come, with countless scenes filmed in near or complete silence. The movie has no music whatsoever prior to the credits, and is the rare film that must be seen in the theater to emphasize the enormous, endless quiet. The cinematography is always elegant, but this primarily serves to make the sporadic scenes of harsh violence all the more jarring. Nevertheless, the low-key scenes are the heart of the film, and allow the audience to enter the minds of the characters, to feel Moss's unrelenting anxiety as he discovers that he will not have a moment's piece in the foreseeable future. Most thrillers exist only for the climactic scenes, but the Coens impressively divide the intensity throughout the film as a whole, finding the drama in the passing of cars and the eerie quiet in the rural night.All this leads to the film's conclusion, which many, particularly those unfamiliar with the novel, see as pretentious, anticlimactic and nihilistic. While the case can certainly be made, I feel the climax (or lack thereof) works. First: climaxes, particularly in well-crafted films, usually fail to live up to the build, a concern which this deliberately circumvented here. Second, the ending is decidedly thematically important, as it also was in the novel, albeit in somewhat different form. The most significant underlying theme of the novel is chance, the lack of control individuals have over their existing. By denying us the expected conclusion, the film illustrates this principle graphically, denying the characters the confrontation that they drive towards throughout the film. Finally, the conclusion is undeniably bleak, but it isn't forced in this way. Though I prefer dark, violent entertainment, I'm not some self-consciously edgy punk who thinks that nihilistic endings are inherently ""real."" The bleak ending, however, is justified by the film as a whole; it is inevitable. (This is in contrast to ""Million Dollar Baby"" and the like, which turn bleak merely to establish their critical bona fides.)Hopefully this will mark a renaissance for the Coens, and perhaps the beginning to decidedly unexpected cinematic success for McCarthy. Unfortunately, ""Burn After Reading"" is all too similar to most recent Coens work, and we can't yet say how ""The Road"" and ""Blood Meridian"" will turn out. (I'm told many like ""All the Pretty Horses,"" though I've never seen nor read it.) Either way, these three individuals are attached to one of the finest films of the 00s.Grade: A",5,Perhaps the best from the Coens,1247961600,"07 19, 2009",2009,6558,"['No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men',

No Country is probably the BEST FILM OF THIS DECADE. This is about film-making as a craft, practiced by people who know what they are doing and have an agenda involving something other than making a ton of money. Yet around the time of its triumph at the Oscars, you could sense the indifference emanating from the mainstream press and moviegoers. This was a film utterly lacking in glamour or over-the-top special effects. It left them cold. I can hear them now: ""Why should we let a bunch of snooty film critics tell us what a good movie is?""For these people, I have no sympathy. Because the fact is, they have nothing to worry about. It is they who the film industry is listening to, not us snobs. And because of this, films of No Country's artistic caliber will soon become extinct. Soon, every time someone pitches the studios a project like No Country they're gonna say, ""Nobody wants to see that."" And for the most part, they're right. Us film snobs are totally outnumbered. And all of us snobs must now come to grips with the plain truth: that people like Orson Wells, Alfred Hitchcock, Francis Copolla, Martin Scorcese, David Lynch, Paul Thomas Anderson and the Coen Brothers have labored, sweated and fought for this art form for the last seventy years and made it into a thing of beauty just so the greater majority of America could chuck all that out the window for the sake of Fast and Furious and ""reality"" shows. Nice going.But years from now, I will still be clinging to my carefully preserved copy of this fine edition to help me remember Tommy Lee Jones' wonderful performance, the stark beauty of the cinematography, the subtle audio treatments in the hotel scene with the barely audible unscrewing of the hallway lightbulb, the sparse but clever and unusual dialogue, and the overall exacting attention to detail that distinguishes a film like this from 98 percent of what has been turning up in theaters during this decade. As for the violence, please. I mean, come on, you can see arguably as many gross-outs on CSI every week.So if you are someone who misses what Hollywood once was and wishes that the studios would not abandon cinema as an art, this one is for you. Yes, it is the Coen's best since Fargo, and I can't think of a better film in this decade except for possibly Mulholland Drive.

85036,A328S9RN3U5M68,0788882988,Grady Harp,"[174, 218]","Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN has been successfully transformed into a film in the skilled hands of Ethan and Joel Coen.  The story is intact, the characters are given the dialog so uniquely McCarthy's invention, and the horror of the message of the book - that we have come to a point in time when crime, especially random murder, surrounds our lives - is, if anything, even more pungent than on the pages of the book.  It is an amazing, and a highly disturbing movie, and while this viewer is one of the few who does not believe it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, there is little doubt that it is a brilliant piece of cinema.The story is fairly simple: on the raw plains of Texas a slaughter of men and dogs engaged in a drug deal is discovered by a simple guy Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin).  Moss observes the mayhem, sees the drugs, finds the 2 million dollar payoff money, takes the money, and embarks on an escape, leaving his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald) to escape the pursuit of a mad killer Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who in turn is being pursued by the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) and a hired hitman (Woody Harrelson). The satchel of money contains a tracking device and Chigurh has the instrument necessary to follow the trail the device leads.  The remainder of the film is the pursuit both in Texas and in Mexico, accompanied by countless brutal murders of all sorts by the crazed Chigurh, until a surprise ending.But the toughest part of this violent film is more in the discussion of shared philosophies between the sheriff and his old cronies: they reflect on the sad state of universal crime that is so different and more malevolent than in the 'old days'.  The conversations, in the superb dialog of these old men, bring our attention to some realities we would rather not confront, and those realities are even more disturbing than the repeated images of bloated bodies and senseless murders that fill the screen.  Jones, Brolin, and Bardem are indeed superb in their roles, but the small cameos of the townsfolk of Texas are little gems of acting and direction.  This is a difficult film to watch because of all of the violence, but the message is one we must heed. We may be allowing the creation of 'no country for any men'.

85038,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0788882988,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 4]","If you've had water cooler chats about NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, you've probably heard it described as ""disturbing""--even by people who loved it.  I recently re-watched the film with friends (neither of whom has seen it before) one of whom said, ""I'm glad I saw it; but I'm sure it's going to give me nightmares.""  The other just nodded her head in agreement: she was otherwise speechless.Even the film's detractors have to admit that it packs a wallop.  Of course,  since it IS the Coen Brothers, you might expect that the amount of blood spilled would be effectively countered by any number of laugh out loud moments.  Well, not quite.  There IS humor in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, but overall, the film's vision is as bleak as the West Texas landscape it depicts.  Like the preceding films in the Coen oeuvre, this movie drips irony, and conventions are subverted right and left.  There's much that can be savored intellectually and aesthetically.  And then, there's the level of violence, which, frankly, many will find off-putting.  And if law officer dealing with all this carnage is the sharp, but world weary Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones, natch) and not the smart, funny and life-affirming (and life bearing) Marge Gunderson of their earlier masterpiece FARGO, well, you are missing at least ONE leavening touch.Of course, neither the Coen Brothers nor any filmmaker should be required to always leave the viewer with that little ray of hope.  Whereas in previous films, their vision might have been described as absurd, here the Brothers Coen veer towards the nihilistic.  And that will leave a lot of viewers as cold as the film's numerous corpses.  They are, of course, adapting the work of novelist Cormac McCarthy, and reportedly did not stray too far from their source work.  That may account for a lot.Filmmakers as original as the Coens do not deal primarily in adaptations, although, in this film, and its immediate predecessor, the re-make of  THE LADYKILLERS, we may be seeing something of a reversal of that trend.  The brothers have said on many occasions that the source novel was perfect material for them, and I certainly won't dispute that assertion substantially.  I will suggest, however, that in films their original screenplays, evildoers are, in the main, quite human and sometimes even oddly sympathetic.  The only other film where there seemed to be an implacable evil entity was the **COMEDY** RAISING ARIZONA.  And in that film, the embodiment of evil turned out to be quite mortal, after all.Put simply, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is what it is: the stuff nightmares are made of.  Thematically, its themes of happenstance and fate, the futility of our best laid schemes are classic Coen.  No earlier film of theirs has ever weighed on me so oppressively as this.

Would you keep it, leave it alone, turn it into the police?  What do you think would happen if the 'bad guys' knew that you had the money?That's the bottom line of this movie. But there's a bigger picture here, in that the people you are dealing with have no respect for human life. It they did, would they be dealing in death to begin with.  One man finds the money, and of course he's a poor guy who could use it.  The guys who 'own' the money, want it back and send an ex-special ops soldier (without any compunction of killing) to get it.  The local Sheriff is after both of them so as to try and stop the killings.  And the 'psychos' people send someone after him because he's gotten out of hand.What makes this such a powerful movie, is what isn't said.  There are parts of this movie where no one says a word.  We see their faces, watch their movements, but are left in a eerily wordless world.  The world isn't silent, it's just wordless.

Woody Harrelson is also one of the stars.  There is no need to spend time discussing the plot as that has been done several times already.  This movie is worth seeing for the fine acting and directing, as well as the gritty realism of Texas and Mexico.  The three primary actors - Brolin, Bardem, and Jones - are each excellent.

This includes all genres, all ages, black and white, computer generated, international, mainstream, nieche films, cult classics - you name it, I got it. Heck, I even took college courses on film, analysis, and film making... None of this changes the fact that this movie blows. The acting was stiff, 95% was shot too dark, the ""gun"" was downright silly, the ending was non-existent, and why this film won any awards other than a Raspberry is a Hollywood mystery. The films that tend to win awards, often do so because there is a limited amount of industry-specific people who want to set themselves apart from the crowd. Sometimes, they get it right (Pan's Labyrinth) and sometimes they get it wrong (as in the case here). Not even the violence, as many here called it, was anything to write home about - you didn't really see anything because it was all shot in the dark! I have seen Western's with more violence than this dull excuse of a film (Soldier Blue). Critics (and regular people) can heighten any film beyond its actual worthiness and claim to be superior to others, with a better understanding of the intent etc bla bla... Nothing changes the fact that I was bored to tears with this overrated mess of a 'movie'.I went to the theater with a buddy to check out the new Coen brothers film. We had great expectations going in, but when we came out, we wanted the two hours of our lives back. This is one of those movies where the ""expert critics"" hail all the things that prevent this film from becoming mainstream. But for the regular Joe, you, and me, this simply boils down to a massive disappointment. The characters are flat, the story drags on 45 minutes too long, the ending may be the worst in film history... Stay away from this one. The early reviews heralded this one for the ""weird cattle gun"" and it's ""extreme violence"" etc. Not true. The weapon was rather silly and most of the important story events are happening in the dark or behind a door (oooh) so as to put your imagination to work, rather than your eyes. This may work well for critics, but for an audience that expects a wild ride, this is a recipe for boredom.",1,still horrible,1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,2500,"['Well', 'response', ""'haters"", 'discussion', 'page', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'taste', 'differs', 'however', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'b', 'movie', 'did', 'will', 'forever', 'stink', 'be', 'boring', 'hell', 'have', '1200', 'movies', 'home', 'anything', 'Gandhi', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'Matrix', 'historic', 'war', 'epics', 'documentaries', 'everything', 'genres', 'ages', 'black', 'white', 'computer', 'generated', 'international', 'mainstream', 'nieche', 'films', 'cult', 'classics', 'name', 'got', 'Heck', 'even', 'took', 'college', 'courses', 'film', 'analysis', 'film', 'making', 'None', 'fact', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'stiff', '95', '%', 'was', 'shot', 'too', 'dark', 'gun', 'was', 'downright', 'silly', 'ending', 'was', 'non-existent', 'why', 'film', 'won', 'awards', 'other', 'Raspberry', 'Hollywood', 'mystery', 'films', 'tend', 'win', 'awards', 'often', 'do', 'so', 'limited', 'amount', 'industry-specific', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'set', 'apart', 'crowd', 'Sometimes', 'get', 'right', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'get', 'wrong', 'case', 'here', 'Not', 'even', 'violence', 'many', 'here', 'called', 'was', 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'anything', 'was', 'shot', 'dark', 'have', 'seen', 'Western', 'more', 'violence', 'dull', 'excuse', 'film', 'Soldier', 'Blue', 'Critics', 'regular', 'people', 'can', 'heighten', 'film', 'actual', 'worthiness', 'claim', 'be', 'superior', 'others', 'better', 'understanding', 'intent', 'etc', 'bla', 'bla', 'Nothing', 'fact', 'was', 'bored', 'tears', 'overrated', 'mess', ""'movie'.I"", 'went', 'theater', 'buddy', 'check', 'out', 'new', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'expectations', 'going', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'wanted', 'two', 'hours', 'lives', 'back', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'expert', 'critics', 'hail', 'things', 'prevent', 'film', 'becoming', 'mainstream', 'regular', 'Joe', 'simply', 'down', 'massive', 'disappointment', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'story', '45', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'ending', 'may', 'be', 'worst', 'film', 'history', 'Stay', 'away', 'one', 'early', 'reviews', 'heralded', 'one', 'weird', 'cattle', 'gun', 'extreme', 'violence', 'etc', 'Not', 'true', 'weapon', 'was', 'rather', 'silly', 'most', 'important', 'story', 'events', 'are', 'happening', 'dark', 'behind', 'door', 'so', 'put', 'imagination', 'work', 'rather', 'eyes', 'may', 'work', 'well', 'critics', 'audience', 'wild', 'ride', 'recipe', 'boredom']",N/A

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[4, 9]","A new Coen Brothers film is always something to look forward to, even if what you are seeing is not these film-makers at their best. ""No Country For Old Men"" from a line from the poet William Butler Yeats-- adapted from a book by the same title by Cormac McCarthy-- is certainly one of their finest. From the opening  panoramic shots of the arid countryside to the excellent casting--to a person-- to the abrupt, existential ending, this movie delivers. Both Josh Brolin (Llewelyn Moss, the Vietnam veteran who discovers the drug money), and Jommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell, give rugged understated performances. Javier Bardem as Chigurh, the crazed mysterious henchman who kills for the delight of it, steals the show, however. An Iago type character, he is the epitome of evil. He kills when his own life is not in danger, if we assume that killing is justified if one's life as a hunter of other humans is in jeopardy.If you see this movie in a theatre, try to select one that shows art films. I made the mistake of seeing ""No Country For Old Men"" in one of those theatres, that run 25 or 30 movies at the same time, situated of course in the obligatory shopping mall. Although there was only a handful of people watching the movie when I saw it, they made up for scarce attendance by laughing through most of the movie as dark and serious as anything I'e seen lately.

85058,A1158PJX6NEVU0,0788882988,HighExpectations,"[3, 3]","This is one of those movies that divides moviegoers. Love it. Hate it. Few fall in between. Some reject it because it fails to promote the promise of a righteousness path. Some embrace it as an affirmation of life's randomness. Whatever. The most objective thing I can say to those who have not yet seen it is that ""No Country for Old Men"" is not for those who seek the promise of a happy ending. Nor is it for those wishing to wallow in absolute darkness. It is perhaps best suited to those open to the possibility that life, no matter how we lead it, is incalculable.As the protagonist, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, opines: ""Even in the contest between man and steer, the outcome is uncertain.""The world of ""No Country for Old Men"" rewards no one code, or set of rules by which to live life. Good country people who work at Wal-Mart, pay their bills on time and take care of their mamas are, in the end, promised no better an outcome than are murderous psychopaths. Time and again, ""No Country for Old Men"" demonstrates this lack of a guarantee. Survival, success, fairness -- roll the dice as gently or as roughly as you want. It doesn't matter. The dice have no say.Still, ""No Country for Old Men"" is filled with characters who live life by their own unique set of rules. In fact, the story's biggest proponent of such rules is the antagonist, Anton Chigurh, a vicious killer who repeatedly promotes the importance of honoring one's word and toeing a defined line. This, some might say, proves the clich&eacute; about a method in madness, but Chigurh, like even the most vicious real-life villains, does not believe he's mad. To him, his way is the only way. He preaches it like a man of God, telling one soon-to-be-dead victim: ""If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?""The sheriff also subscribes to a code, though he doesn't go so far as to define it as such. He makes no assumptions, follows the law, follows the evidence, and wastes no time posturing or putting on airs. Rather, he surveys a series of ever-more-violent acts occurring in the world around him and repeatedly concedes that he does not understand. This admission of ignorance is particularly admirable when contrasted with statements made by his counterpart, a hitman who's also in pursuit of the antagonist, Chigurh. Unlike the sheriff, the hitman believes he understands the nature of this particular evil: ""He's a psychopathic killer, but so what? Plenty of them around."" Divergent paths, but both intended to lead their followers to the same destination.Then there's the driver of all action from the start of the story, the deuteragonist, Llewellyn Moss, an out-of-work war veteran whose view of the world is shared through the camera's lens. Before we see any part of Moss, we see what he sees through the scope of his rifle while he's sighting prey in the desert. We hear him fire a shot, then fume over his failure to achieve an instantaneous kill. We follow him as he follows the blood trail of his prey to its unexpected intersection with a second blood trail. This is the first turning point and Moss' choice to follow the second trail in reverse -- away from the limping, bleeding dog that created it, and toward wherever the injury occurred -- is the first in a series of choices that quickly transform Moss from hunter to the bleeding prey.""No Country for Old Men"" is brilliant storytelling, whether it be the book by Cormac McCarthy, or the Coen Brothers' adaptation for the screen. Momentum builds steadily from the start, in conflict after conflict, to the point of no return and beyond. The chase that ensues consumes Act II and moves us quickly along to the climax, as well as to an inspired denouement.Few movies succeed on as many levels as ""No Country for Old Men.""

Pace,"[0, 0]","Any filmmaker seeking to adapt a Cormac McCarthy novel faces the significant problem that a large part of the strength of each is the pure poetry of McCarthy's prose.  In No Country for Old Men the Coen brothers provide cinematography that serves as a suitable stand-in for the poetry of McCarthy's prose.  They back that up with a sharp attention to detail.There are three main characters: Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss, hired-killer Anton Chigurh, and rural county sheriff Tom Bell.The Coen brothers capture perfectly one of McCarthy's themes--the dichotomy  between extreme violence and genuinely nice regular folk.  There is also a dichotomy between the poetry of so much of the dialogue and monologues, especially the sheriff's musings, and the ordinariness of dialogue with tertiary characters.And it is a very violent movie.  Chigurh kills 10-14 people, depending on your opinion on murders that appear to happen off-screen.

Once again, I'm gonna use Terminator as an example, because in that movie we knew that Reese and Sarah where both in dire straights; they had to find a way to defeat the machine that was chasing them and they knew that the world was going to end. This movie didn't have that, and I guess this is kind of a spoiler, but you shouldn't care; THE MOVIE DOESN'T BUILD TO ANYTHING. Nothing! The main antagonist in this story kills all these people and in the end walks away, literally, after he gets in a car crash, he gets out, and walks away. Tommy Lee Jones has his little bit of dialogue at the end, and boom, movies over. Stupid.So today is a sad day because the Coen Brothers have shown that they are capable of wasting their talents.And here it is, The Bottom Line;21%- A strong set-up cannot save the remainder of this slow, irreverent, unnecessary and ultimately inept movie; This movie can be definable simply as the text book definition for Overrated, and that is exactly what it is.",1,No Excuse for Overrated Movies,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,2398,"['Okay', 'secret', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'are', 'good', 'directors', 'when', 'heard', 'movie', 'really', 'got', 'hopes', 'up', 'was', 'best', 'decision', 'NO', 'was', 'not.This', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'thought', 'steady', 'pacing', 'quiet', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'going', 'build', 'up', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'just', 'couple', 'random', 'unnecessary', 'deaths', 'spread', 'out', '2', 'hours.To', 'ever', 'lasting', 'shame', 'sat', 'full', '2', 'hours', 'movie', 'hopes', 'would', 'have', 'something', 'show', 'hype', 'critical', 'acclaim.You', 'wan', 'na', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'artsy', 'ass', 'version', 'Terminator', 'really', 'mean', 'example', 'Man', 'armed', 'heavy', 'weapons', 'tactics', 'chasing', 'ordinary', 'person-The', 'heavily', 'armed', 'individual', 'how', 'heal', 'repair', 'himself-The', 'heavily', 'armed', 'individual', 'also', 'methods', 'tracking', 'normal', 'guys', 'movementsThe', 'setup', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'western', 'style', 'story', 'other', 'aspects', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'included', 'western', 'before', 'Needless', 'say', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'had', 'LOT', 'work', 'somehow', 'fell', 'extremely', 'short.I', 'got', 'ta', 'give', 'credit', 'pseudo', 'redeemable', 'aspects', 'film', 'including', 'Acting-A', 'Few', 'VERY', 'SMALL', 'Parts', 'ScriptThe', 'Acting', 'was', 'superb', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'where', 'pretty', 'bad-ass', 'right', 'there', ""'m"", 'not', 'instilled', 'sense', 'urgency', 'Once', 'again', ""'m"", 'gon', 'use', 'Terminator', 'example', 'movie', 'knew', 'Reese', 'Sarah', 'where', 'dire', 'straights', 'had', 'find', 'way', 'defeat', 'machine', 'was', 'chasing', 'knew', 'world', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'guess', 'kind', 'spoiler', 'should', ""n't"", 'care', 'MOVIE', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'BUILD', 'TO', 'ANYTHING', 'Nothing', 'main', 'antagonist', 'story', 'people', 'end', 'away', 'literally', 'car', 'crash', 'out', 'away', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'little', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'end', 'boom', 'movies', 'Stupid.So', 'today', 'sad', 'day', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'shown', 'are', 'capable', 'wasting', 'talents.And', 'here', 'Bottom', 'Line', '21', '%', 'strong', 'set-up', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'remainder', 'slow', 'irreverent', 'unnecessary', 'ultimately', 'inept', 'movie', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'definable', 'simply', 'text', 'book', 'definition', 'Overrated', 'exactly', 'what']",N/A

It is full of suspense right from the start and does never really slow down. There is some blood and gore but never overly displayed. Throughout the film you will find some humor.The acting is excellent and the quite rich dialog in the Texan accent is simply brilliant. It was really interesting to hear the actors talk in their normal accent later when I was watching the interviews on the bonus material on the DVD.All characters are very well developed.I also very much enjoyed the cinematography. A lot of the filming is done in desert country. Those views and sceneries are spectacular.I didn't realize it at first but there is actually no soundtrack. All the  background noises are natural, like the wind blowing. The storyline is kept pretty straight, no unexpected turns, in the end a view things are left open.

The USA have reached a point when history is the only master of the game, master of ceremonies. The USA have produced a situation that will resolve itself by using its own contradictions till the whole world is destroyed if necessary. This world is dominated by money that has to be easy and does not have to be clean, even would I say that is to be dirty: that gives it more taste and flavor. The world is dominated by the hunger of overstuffed men for anything that will satiate this hunger with something unreal, surreal, over-real: let it be a powder, an injection or whatever but let it erase the darkness of the night, even in the middle of the day, and cultivate some kind of visionary illusion. Then add the third dimension of this world seen through the distorting glass of the USA: violence not for the sake of making anyone suffer. That is no longer funny. Torturing is the pleasure of the simple minded. We are dealing here with a totally psychotic and asocial schizophrenic who can only find his satisfaction, his fun, his pleasure in imposing death in the cleanest way possible. And if a bullet does not suffice let's have a second to prevent any useless suffering. The USA in their immense hunger for money and drugs, speculation and hunger, accumulation and greed, have attracted on to themselves the worst killers ever, the worst predators ever, the worst rotten-meat-eaters you can imagine. They prosper on manure that they distillate in their speculative bank practices. They thrive on human garbage they concentrate in their appropriative confiscation of all they see and cannot accept not to have. Some try to play cat and mouse with them but these are not the cat and the cat knows it and the cat cannot accept any escape. The sheriff though will survive because he will realize the vulture is wounded less than two yards from him and he the lawman will walk away without confronting him. He will resign due to his cowardice and he will dream his father in a typical posture of the Trail of Tears celebrating the end of the Indian genocide, but carrying a horn full of fire as if Satan did not have any matches. No hope for the average American who wishes to have eternal life in this world without death and perfect innocence in a time when even new-born babies are soiled with the grossest crimes and desires imaginable. A hairless teenager at the end will find five hundred dollars kind of not enough for a five dollar Wal Mart shirt sold to the hyena who disappears when no survivor is any longer blocking his way.

All the pieces are well crafted, but not all of the pieces are present for a complete puzzle. The movie has a very unsatisfying ending in my opinion. Way too many unanswered questions.

What intrigued me about this film is it had big name stars in it, so yes, I did pay money to go see this big-budget film in a movie theatre.This film is for adults. It does contain grisly, bloody violence.There is a serial killer roaming Texas. His name is Anton Chigurh.Llewelyn Moss is an ex-wielder who is hunting antelope in the desert. He shoots one, but it escapes. He follows a blood path that leads him to a hurt black pit bull dog. He comes across in the canyon looking from above, several trucks with dead bodies nearby. He goes down there to investigate.  One clue leads to another and ultimately he finds the briefcase full of drug money.He goes home to his wife (Kelly MacDonald), but is still perturbed by what he saw in the desert. Not able to sleep, he goes back out to the area of the crime.Suddenly the hunter becomes the hunted. The killer, Anton, has found him.  He is after the briefcase of money and Llewelyn. It becomes a dangerous game of cat & mouse as Llewelyn Moss travels around Texas as the psychopathic killer closes in on him and kills nearly everyone he comes in contact with as he explains, like a coin being passed around for years.  Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is also on the trail for the killer.Also in the cast: Garret Dillahunt, Eduardo Antonio Garcia, Gene Jones, Woody Harrelson, Barry Corbin, Marc Miles.Filmed in Eagle Pass, Texas. Marfa, Texas. Las Vegas, New Mexico.The well-known stars of this movie really make this film watchable. If after seeing this film, you are still disturbed, just keep in mind, this story was set in 1980 and the way the killer gets into a room and the way he gets away unseen, probably could not happen in real life. The character has left behind so many clues, in real-life he would be stopped and caught.You know when Tommy Lee Jones is in a film, it is going to be a good one.Javier Bardem is in such an unusual role that as the killer, but is a likeable actor and has done good roles in the past. Bravo to Javier Bardem for traveling to America and in Texas of all places to film this movie.  Josh Brolin also gives a fine performance and makes it easy to follow him throughout the film. You want more.The entire film has been well-cast, even the smaller roles had just the right actors, especially Gene Jones as the gas station proprietor who gives an unforgetable and memorable performance.This rated ""R"" film is abit hard on the eyes sometimes as the murders and bodies are grisly.  However, the film does generously pull back from the violence as the film progresses to give you a breather and leaving some murders left to imagination, thank you very much.I am positive this film will be heavily edited for broadcast television showing. The DVD version will most likely be a popular one and hopefully will include additional scenes.Running time: 2 hours, 3 min.",5,"Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones give a great performance.",1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,2950,"['saw', 'previews', 'film', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'Saw', '4', 'really', 'put', 'scared', 'mood', 'already', 'What', 'intrigued', 'film', 'had', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'so', 'yes', 'did', 'pay', 'money', 'go', 'see', 'big-budget', 'film', 'movie', 'theatre.This', 'film', 'adults', 'contain', 'grisly', 'bloody', 'serial', 'killer', 'roaming', 'Texas', 'name', 'Anton', 'Chigurh.Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'ex-wielder', 'who', 'hunting', 'antelope', 'desert', 'shoots', 'one', 'blood', 'path', 'hurt', 'black', 'pit', 'bull', 'dog', 'canyon', 'looking', 'several', 'trucks', 'dead', 'bodies', 'nearby', 'down', 'there', 'investigate', 'One', 'clue', 'ultimately', 'briefcase', 'full', 'drug', 'money.He', 'home', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'still', 'perturbed', 'what', 'saw', 'desert', 'Not', 'able', 'sleep', 'back', 'area', 'crime.Suddenly', 'hunter', 'hunted', 'killer', 'Anton', 'found', 'briefcase', 'money', 'Llewelyn', 'dangerous', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'around', 'Texas', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'closes', 'kills', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'contact', 'coin', 'being', 'passed', 'years', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'also', 'trail', 'killer.Also', 'cast', 'Garret', 'Dillahunt', 'Eduardo', 'Antonio', 'Garcia', 'Gene', 'Jones', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'Marc', 'Miles.Filmed', 'Eagle', 'Pass', 'Texas', 'Marfa', 'Texas', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'New', 'Mexico.The', 'well-known', 'stars', 'movie', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'watchable', 'seeing', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'disturbed', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'story', 'was', 'set', '1980', 'way', 'killer', 'room', 'way', 'away', 'unseen', 'probably', 'could', 'not', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'left', 'behind', 'so', 'many', 'clues', 'real-life', 'would', 'be', 'stopped', 'caught.You', 'know', 'when', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'one.Javier', 'Bardem', 'such', 'unusual', 'role', 'killer', 'likeable', 'actor', 'done', 'good', 'roles', 'past', 'Bravo', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'traveling', 'America', 'Texas', 'places', 'film', 'movie', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'also', 'fine', 'performance', 'easy', 'follow', 'film', 'want', 'more.The', 'entire', 'film', 'been', 'well-cast', 'even', 'smaller', 'roles', 'had', 'just', 'right', 'actors', 'especially', 'Gene', 'Jones', 'gas', 'station', 'proprietor', 'who', 'unforgetable', 'memorable', 'performance.This', 'rated', 'R', 'film', 'abit', 'hard', 'eyes', 'sometimes', 'murders', 'bodies', 'are', 'grisly', 'However', 'film', 'generously', 'pull', 'back', 'violence', 'film', 'give', 'breather', 'leaving', 'murders', 'left', 'imagination', 'thank', 'very', 'much.I', 'am', 'positive', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'heavily', 'edited', 'broadcast', 'television', 'showing', 'DVD', 'version', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'popular', 'one', 'hopefully', 'will', 'include', 'additional', 'scenes.Running', 'time', '2', 'hours', '3', 'min']",N/A

When I watched my first Cohen movie (Raising Arizona) I was left asking a lot of questions, who are these people? why is this happening?  Why is that guy so mad?  And you really never get the answers you're looking for in the movie.I thought maybe it was just that movie and so I watched another one(hudsucker proxy), and can you believe I found myself going through the same experience asking similar questions and feeling unfulfilled when the movie was over.But just like the eggplant, the more you give the cohen brothers a try the more you like them, I know I do.No Country... is a good movie, not great but just good.  The story is suspenseful, and will keep you at the end of your seat for the whole movie.  I felt like I was holding my breath for 2 hours, wondering what was going to happen next.The movie is violent, but not over the top like you would see in a horror movie.  The depiction of WEst Texas thirty years ago is all to familiar to me, and seems in itself a metaphor of the whole movie, just as the wind blows dirt on everyone, so there is also a little dirt on most of the main characters of the movie.Here's my straight opinion on the movie:1. As far as Cohen movies go, it was good but not one of my favorites2. Your still left with a lot of questions unanswered but it wouldn't be a Cohen movie if there wern't3.  If you want a happy ending don't watch this movie, nothing happy about it.4.  The bright spot in the movie are the actors.  Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are excellent in this movie, Brolin puts in one of his best performances, and Jones hits a home run in his portrayal should have received a supporting oscar for it.  Javier Bardem is one scary sucker in this movie, I didn't know a lot about him before the movie, but he left me wanting to know more.On the whole a good movie, something to watch once to say you've seen it, and then move on to some of the great Cohen movies (O Brother, Raising Arizona, Fargo)",3,No Country...

As always happens, the movie had to trim away scenes and characters but the heart of the story remained intact.The Coen brothers had a lot less cutting to do from the source material in making No Country for Old Men. Regardless, the movie and the book both stand up well to repeated viewings and readings.BTW: Here's my five-star review of the book:I'm a fan of the Coen Brothers, so their attachment to this book is what drew me to the movie first. I hadn't read Cormac McCarthy's other books, so this story was a nice introduction to his fiction and I look forward to delving into his other works.The book is a modern-day western. My review follows more than 400 other Amazon reviews, so I'm not going to walk you over well-worn paths.My review is for people who saw the movie first and may think it unnecessary to pick up the book. Don't deprive yourself. If you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy the book. I liken this experience to watching the Oscar-winning filmThe Godfatherand then following that up by reading Mario Puzo's novelThe Godfather.As you might have already read or heard, the movie follows the book closely. Naturally, the book provides much more detail about Anton Chigurh, the psychopathic killer at the heart of the story. It is these additional details, these brief scenes that help flesh out Chigurh more as a man than as pure, unrelenting evil.",5,A modern classic that will stand alongside The Godfather,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,1798,"['first', 'wrote', 'Amazon', 'review', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'screenplay', 'actually', 'came', 'word-for-word', 'book.Although', 'many', 'parts', 'book', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'appear', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'missing', 'out', 'story', 'media.I', 'mentionedThe', 'Godfatherbecause', 'made', 'point', 'reading', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', 'always', 'movie', 'had', 'trim', 'away', 'scenes', 'characters', 'heart', 'story', 'remained', 'intact.The', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'had', 'lot', 'less', 'cutting', 'do', 'source', 'material', 'making', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Regardless', 'movie', 'book', 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'readings.BTW', 'Here', 'five-star', 'review', 'book', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'attachment', 'book', 'what', 'drew', 'movie', 'first', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'other', 'books', 'story', 'was', 'nice', 'introduction', 'fiction', 'look', 'forward', 'delving', 'other', 'works.The', 'book', 'modern-day', 'western', 'My', 'review', 'more', '400', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'walk', 'well-worn', 'paths.My', 'review', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'may', 'think', 'unnecessary', 'pick', 'up', 'book', 'Do', ""n't"", 'deprive', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'book', 'liken', 'experience', 'watching', 'Oscar-winning', 'filmThe', 'Godfatherand', 'then', 'following', 'up', 'reading', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'novelThe', 'Godfather.As', 'might', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'heard', 'movie', 'book', 'closely', 'Naturally', 'book', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'heart', 'story', 'additional', 'details', 'brief', 'scenes', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'Chigurh', 'more', 'man', 'pure', 'unrelenting', 'evil']",N/A

85085,A140XH16IKR4B0,0788882988,Jean E. Pouliot,"[11, 17]","On one level, NCFOM is story about the collision of cowboy culture with drug culture. Set in 1980, it concerns the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, and a missing satchel holding over $1 million. Good guy Llewelyn Moss comes across the money, decides to keep it, and figures he is smart to outrun the bad guys, who also want it back. Yet two larger forces are also at play -- the law, represented by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and an enigmatic sociopath, Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem. Anton is fond of shooting metal bolts into skulls or door locks using nearly-noiseless blasts from a compressed air tank. That's when he is not using a silenced shotgun with brutal accuracy. The plot moves the characters from desert to trailer park to motel, with the outcome always in doubt and the intensity on high.But there's more going on here than a shoot-em-up. The movie explores ideas of fate, intention and luck. It also explores the frustrating realization at the base of every human life that one's mission, however grand or petty, however exemplary or banal or destructive, will remain unfinished. As the body count mounts, thanks to Anton and his gas gun, Sheriff Bell struggles with coming end of his own career. As the tide of the drug trade begins to overwhelm his familiar world, he comes face to face with the fact that he will not finish the job he began. Only Death, cold and implacable, extends its icy grip beyond the human lifespan.NCFOM is extremely violent, though the violence is rendered believably. The suspense level is very high until close to the end. This is not a feel good movie, but has other rewards -- the terrific writing, convincing acting, and even bitter humor. Standout performaces were too numerous to mention, but include Josh Brolin as Moss, Kelly MacDonald as his worried but cooperative wife and Garret Dillahunt as Sheriff Bell's smart but unseasoned protege Deputy Wendell.Well-made as it is, this film has not sat well with me. I should have trusted my instincts when I saw the trailer. The violence is right on the edge of gratuitous, threatening to bury the message beneath the mayhem.

It doesn't even struggle to its feet in order to at least end well. After a couple of tedious hours of the bad guy dragging about a cattle gun attached to a compressed air tank, the Coen brothers are so pleased with themselves, they decide to insult the audience with nothing more clever or novel than a blank screen ending.

I've got a good idea where my responses will be like from the quick look at reviewers here. But I don't care, my lifespan as a reviewer here has never been reliant on how people respond. I make my statement true to how I feel.This movie stunk. I loved certain elements, but like all the great one's say, a movie is great not from segmented pieces but by the whole. It has all the makings of an indie film, which is my kind of movie. I've lived in Art houses every since 2005 with a history of violence. I love the tame and mature approach to revealing a movie. I get the sense that the aim of this movie was to produce such dramatic, theatric sadness that we couldn't handle seeing the reality of the ending. That this is no country indeed for old men, or for the matter, any men or women. Now what I'm about to say does not apply to every genre, but please: Movies are different from books not just on the intellectual approach, but also in that the power of certain cinema features it is indeed what you see that bares its most powerful infliction. Seeing is believing and to think that such an ending, almost Saprano's like, could settle such a furiously showcased film is implausible for me. It felt abandoning. A few exhasperated speeches by a Sheriff beyond his capabilities in dealing with reality and a criminal psychopath preoccupied with unknown thoughts. That's what there is, and no matter what your preception clearly that is the point, it is up to great discussion.

85091,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,0788882988,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[7, 9]","This film was a real treat and something that I wanted to watch for quite some time because I admire Javier Bardem as an actor. No Country for Old Men is a thriller that delivers brilliant levels of suspense, fear and apprehension whilst simultaneously disposing of the genre's preconceived conventions. The cinematography on show unashamedly harks back to the Coens debut Blood Simple (1983) and with their regular Cinematographer at the helm, Roger A. Deakins, it is no surprise that No Country for Old Men has been nominated for an Oscar in this category. The films score is so subtle that it aids the tension by unwittingly achieving an omnipotent silence recognizable only through an assortment of wind noises which have been superbly complemented by the bleak dialogue and dark humor.To complement the film further it should be noted that on show here are some of the most powerful and flawless performances for some time and Tommy Lee Jones's is purely outstanding. His character embodies a demeanor of pensive sadness beautifully portrayed by the veteran actor in what is conceivably his best role to date (shocking that he has not been nominated for an Oscar, but this could be due to a lack of screen presence) it should also be noted that the final reels of the film are probably among his best ever committed to celluloid. Javier Bardem's role as the relentless and ruthless psychotic killer is astounding, his on screen presence mesmerizing and his mere appearance a pure treat along with a sense of a darkness casting over the whole room and it really makes you feel like you are in the presence of true evil. When it comes to playing a psychotic I would go so far to say that his performance has only ever been equaled by Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lector and maybe in years to come,I would like to point out that there is little to no music in the entire film which is a plus to me. The use of silence throughout the majority of the movie is very original in the sense that the music doesn't cue the viewer how to react and when.So again, not for everyone, but if you are a frequent movie goer and truly understand the makings of a good film, this is an excellent one to see.I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did...it's undeniably worth your time.",5,Flip A Coin......,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,2281,"['film', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'something', 'wanted', 'watch', 'quite', 'time', 'admire', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'actor', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'thriller', 'delivers', 'brilliant', 'levels', 'suspense', 'fear', 'apprehension', 'whilst', 'simultaneously', 'disposing', 'genre', 'preconceived', 'conventions', 'cinematography', 'show', 'unashamedly', 'back', 'Coens', 'debut', 'Blood', 'Simple', '1983', 'regular', 'Cinematographer', 'helm', 'Roger', 'A.', 'Deakins', 'surprise', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'category', 'films', 'score', 'so', 'subtle', 'tension', 'unwittingly', 'achieving', 'omnipotent', 'silence', 'recognizable', 'only', 'assortment', 'wind', 'noises', 'have', 'been', 'superbly', 'complemented', 'bleak', 'dialogue', 'dark', 'humor.To', 'complement', 'film', 'further', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'show', 'here', 'are', 'most', 'powerful', 'flawless', 'performances', 'time', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'purely', 'outstanding', 'character', 'demeanor', 'pensive', 'sadness', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'veteran', 'actor', 'what', 'conceivably', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'shocking', 'not', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'lack', 'screen', 'presence', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'final', 'reels', 'film', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'ever', 'committed', 'celluloid', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'role', 'relentless', 'ruthless', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'astounding', 'screen', 'presence', 'mesmerizing', 'mere', 'appearance', 'pure', 'treat', 'sense', 'darkness', 'casting', 'whole', 'room', 'really', 'feel', 'are', 'presence', 'true', 'evil', 'When', 'playing', 'psychotic', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'performance', 'only', 'ever', 'been', 'equaled', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'portrayal', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'maybe', 'years', 'come', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'little', 'music', 'entire', 'film', 'plus', 'use', 'silence', 'majority', 'movie', 'very', 'original', 'sense', 'music', ""n't"", 'cue', 'viewer', 'how', 'react', 'when.So', 'again', 'not', 'everyone', 'are', 'frequent', 'movie', 'goer', 'truly', 'understand', 'makings', 'good', 'film', 'excellent', 'one', 'see.I', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'undeniably', 'worth', 'time']",N/A

85095,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,0788882988,J from NY,"[1, 3]","Joel and Ethan Coen have proven, as filmmakers sometimes do, that Hollywood has not entirely degenerated into FX effects, big name actors doing precisely nothing, and huge amounts of money which would have been better used feeding hungry children.  (See ""Live Free or Die Hard"" for the kind of thing I'm talking about.)Based on the equally grisly novel by Cormac McCarthy, ""No Country"" is essentially meditation on evil and the way in which evil slowly corrodes the human soul through intimidation, fear, apprehension, and last but not least:resignation.  It is also a thinly disguised commentary on the impotence of authority to protect us from phenomena which arises from the worst of human instincts.Nearly every scene in this film is rich with symbolism, angst, and a sense that things could go horribly wrong at any moment in a huge tide of slaughtered innocence.  Each character represents a piece of the American landscape which, in the present time, has become obsolete.  Josh Brolin's Moss, clearly a cowboy of the classic Bonanza/Western variety, finds that his ethics no longer apply when he comes into conflict with Chiggurh, played by Javier Bardem in one of the best performances I have ever seen in any movie, who embodies the evil and meaninglessness lurking somewhere within us all.  He resembles some kind of bow legged Frankenstein, lurking across the Mexican landscape with his emphysema tank resembling cattle gun, killing sometimes for pleasure and sometimes for principle, taking everything he wants; not so much because he's pursuing the money Moss has as his thorough enjoyment of the entire affair.  Bardem manages to make his voice a grating, terrifying rasp, as though Darth Vader picked up a crack habit and decided to return an re-join the Emperor.Pretty much everyone who comes in his path dies quickly; his coin toss is the only possible salvation, and even that seems tenuous.  If he wants you to die, you do, no matter how much you resist, flee, or hire other people to protect you.  Though it is clear that Chiggurh is human (I wasn't sure until he bled) I have no doubt that the Coen's use him as a metaphor for the absurd ways in which we flee from the inevitable.  Moss goes from hotel to hotel, jumps across national borders, hides in hospitals, and none of it is of any consequence.  You could very safely interpret this film as a very stark reminder that whatever we do, however far we flee, oblivion cannot be avoided, and neither can our humanity.  First Brolin's Moss, after tangling with Chiggurh for awhile and nearly dying as a result, stumbles across three youths walking near the New Mexico border; they ask him if he was in a car accident, and he uses a bloodstained dollar bill to buy a coat from one of them.  Chiggurh does the same thing (with two younger men riding on bikes) at the end of the film, when we finally get to see him bleed a little bit; he uses a similar bloody dollar bill.  The first three youths are eager for the money, and the second group consider it unethical to take money from a man who ""has a f**king bone sticking out of his arm"".  Hushing up corruption and pain with money, all of it somehow soaked in the blood of another, becomes easier with age.Tommy Lee Jones is perhaps the most ""normal"" of all the characters in the film, and we slowly discover that he is going to make absolutely no difference in Moss' fate or the fate of his wife.  He has seen too much gratuitous evil, and he is sick of being involved or even trying.  For all that he has some of the best lines in the film, lecturing the younger sherrif about what he's in for.  They both seem like fossilized relics from a time long past when things made sense and they could keep track of the blood.""No Country For Old Men"" is a wake up call of sorts, but for all the questions the Coen brother raise they offer very few answers; perhaps because in the worldly sense there really aren't any.  The death of Carlo Jean and the narrow survival of Chiggurh clinches it: salvation is elusive or even absent in this world. The film left me with such a palpable feeling of nihilism and evil that I could almost taste it; for all that, it was also thought provoking, and simply the best movie I have seen in years.",5,"Instant masterpiece, no question",1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,4249,"['Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'have', 'proven', 'filmmakers', 'sometimes', 'do', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'entirely', 'degenerated', 'FX', 'effects', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'doing', 'precisely', 'nothing', 'huge', 'amounts', 'money', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'used', 'feeding', 'hungry', 'children', 'See', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'kind', 'thing', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Based', 'equally', 'grisly', 'novel', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'Country', 'essentially', 'meditation', 'evil', 'way', 'evil', 'slowly', 'human', 'soul', 'intimidation', 'fear', 'apprehension', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'resignation', 'also', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'commentary', 'impotence', 'authority', 'protect', 'phenomena', 'worst', 'human', 'instincts.Nearly', 'scene', 'film', 'rich', 'symbolism', 'angst', 'sense', 'things', 'could', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'moment', 'huge', 'tide', 'slaughtered', 'innocence', 'character', 'piece', 'American', 'landscape', 'present', 'time', 'become', 'obsolete', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Moss', 'clearly', 'cowboy', 'classic', 'Bonanza/Western', 'variety', 'ethics', 'no', 'longer', 'apply', 'when', 'conflict', 'Chiggurh', 'played', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'who', 'evil', 'meaninglessness', 'lurking', 'somewhere', 'kind', 'bow', 'legged', 'Frankenstein', 'lurking', 'Mexican', 'landscape', 'emphysema', 'tank', 'resembling', 'cattle', 'gun', 'killing', 'sometimes', 'pleasure', 'sometimes', 'principle', 'taking', 'everything', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'pursuing', 'money', 'Moss', 'thorough', 'enjoyment', 'entire', 'affair', 'Bardem', 'make', 'voice', 'grating', 'terrifying', 'rasp', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'picked', 'up', 'crack', 'habit', 'decided', 'return', 're-join', 'Emperor.Pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'who', 'path', 'quickly', 'coin', 'toss', 'only', 'possible', 'salvation', 'even', 'tenuous', 'die', 'do', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'resist', 'flee', 'hire', 'other', 'people', 'protect', 'clear', 'Chiggurh', 'human', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'bled', 'have', 'doubt', 'Coen', 'use', 'metaphor', 'absurd', 'ways', 'flee', 'inevitable', 'Moss', 'hotel', 'hotel', 'jumps', 'national', 'borders', 'hides', 'hospitals', 'none', 'consequence', 'could', 'very', 'safely', 'interpret', 'film', 'very', 'stark', 'reminder', 'do', 'however', 'far', 'flee', 'oblivion', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'avoided', 'neither', 'can', 'humanity', 'First', 'Brolin', 'Moss', 'tangling', 'Chiggurh', 'awhile', 'nearly', 'dying', 'result', 'stumbles', 'three', 'youths', 'walking', 'New', 'Mexico', 'border', 'ask', 'was', 'car', 'accident', 'bloodstained', 'dollar', 'bill', 'buy', 'coat', 'one', 'Chiggurh', 'same', 'thing', 'two', 'younger', 'men', 'riding', 'bikes', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'bleed', 'little', 'bit', 'similar', 'bloody', 'dollar', 'bill', 'first', 'three', 'youths', 'are', 'eager', 'money', 'second', 'group', 'consider', 'unethical', 'take', 'money', 'man', 'who', 'f**king', 'bone', 'sticking', 'arm', 'Hushing', 'up', 'corruption', 'pain', 'money', 'somehow', 'soaked', 'blood', 'easier', 'age.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'perhaps', 'most', 'normal', 'characters', 'film', 'slowly', 'discover', 'going', 'make', 'absolutely', 'difference', 'Moss', 'fate', 'fate', 'wife', 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'gratuitous', 'evil', 'sick', 'being', 'involved', 'even', 'trying', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'lecturing', 'younger', 'sherrif', 'what', 'seem', 'fossilized', 'relics', 'time', 'long', 'past', 'when', 'things', 'made', 'sense', 'could', 'keep', 'track', 'blood', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'sorts', 'questions', 'Coen', 'brother', 'raise', 'offer', 'very', 'few', 'answers', 'perhaps', 'worldly', 'sense', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'death', 'Carlo', 'Jean', 'narrow', 'survival', 'Chiggurh', 'clinches', 'salvation', 'elusive', 'even', 'absent', 'world', 'film', 'left', 'palpable', 'feeling', 'nihilism', 'evil', 'could', 'almost', 'taste', 'was', 'also', 'thought', 'provoking', 'simply', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'years']",N/A

Engrossing suspense.As to the ending, it's controversial.  I won't give it away, but some people like it and some people hate it.  I guess what you might want to think of is that Tommy Lee Jones's sheriff character (the ""old man"" in the title) is really the main character.  The point of the story is how the world is changing, as seen by an old Texan sheriff.  Everything else happens around that.I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's book, but this film is supposed to be very faithful to it, ending and all.I'm not a film scholar, but I had no problems with this one, acting, writing, directing, or otherwise.

This is another piece that endeavors to be more than just mindless plotline, this time in an otherwise modern Western.  The cimematography at parts is notable, the characters and some of the acting are here and there.  Bardem, and the Coens' depiction and use of him, is outstanding. Brolin, is decent hitting the persona of West Texas, and that said, the work in the dialog bringing out the flavor and style of this area is really well done.  Otherwise, some of the other attemps, whether by writing, acting, or directing are noisome or detract from the story.  Tommy Lee Jones character being one of those parts.  He seems sharp on everything, but never really does anything or impact the story.  His portrayal by Jones seems at odds with his place in the film.  Some of the plot around certain parts including that of Harrelson or the Mother-in-Law, whom both otherwise did a fine job in acting, seems an odd fit.

Give credit to the Coens for their much deserved Academy award. This film could have been made in a present day setting but the Coens made the effort to do a 1980's period film instead. The attention to period detail is commendable making it look like a Peckinpah film. The casting for this film is absolutely perfect with rich and memorable characters such as Tommy Lee Jones as the weary sheriff with the timely one-liners as well as Vietnam vet Josh Brolin as the resourceful man on the run who would have been more than a match for most pursuers with the exception of Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. His character is one of the most horrifying villains in movie history whose only motivation for killing is his own warped principles. Some have criticized the ending and it might have been more satisfying for there to have been an exciting shootout or something but that would have been too predictable.

Most movies have basically the same plot, a similar timeline, and a near-identical ending.  Pretty soon, they start bluring together and you can't even remember which ones you've seen and which ones you haven't seen.No Country For Old Men is guaranteed to be memorable.  First of all. the setting is masterfully done.  It takes place in Southwest Texas in 1980.  I watched a few scenes from the movie while it was playing at someone else's house. When I saw all of the 1970s era trucks, clothing, and town scenes, I HAD to see the movie.  They did such a good job portraying Southwester Texas from 30 years ago, that almost makes it worth it right there.As everyone has heard, the movie is full of violence and brutal murders.  It was not random pointless violence though.  It all fit into the storyline and all had the effect of building suspense and adding to the plot.  There is a lot of thematic material.  I was thinking in terms of archetypes and all that stuff I was forced to learn in high school. YOu have the old Sheriff, played ty Tommy Lee Jones, who is essentially a good guy who only wants to do right, you have the protaganist, the small time cowboy from the trailer park, who finds the suitcase of money from the drug deal gone bad, and you have the psychotic killer who is after him.The movie got me thinking, how much is money really worth? Would I take that suitcase of money?  Is money worth your life?  When you are watching this movie, pay attention to this:  HOw much is the money worth, both literary and figuratively.  In one of the early scenes, you hear it stated that there are 2 million dollars in that briefcase.  But as the movie goes on, look at the money and make your own estimate of its value.  Lets see if you can catch what I am talking about.A lot of people hated the ending, because it isn't the same Disney movie kind of ending that we are used to. GOOD is what I say.  I'm tired of knowing exactly what is going to happen 15 minutes into each movie.  Think of this movie as a journey rather than a destination, but the final words give you something to think about.  I think part of the thematic material involves knowing your liminations.  Lets see if you come to the same conclusion as me.

The vintage sheriff type (played and voiced by Tommy Lee Jones) states, ""You can't help but compare yourself gainst the oldtimers. Can't help but wonder how they would've operated these times. There was this boy I sent to the gas chamber at Huntsville here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killed a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about fifteen minutes. I don't know what to make of that. I surely don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job - not to be glorious. But I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. To go into something you don't understand you would have to be crazy or *become part of it*.""This series of voice-over encapsulates the film's point - that evil no longer needs a reason, and probably never did; only now, evil is more prevalent and the old ways of handling evil? Well, they're are finished. They simply won't work anymore.So begins our film. The war that rages in this film is not so much that of a bounty hunter pitted against the man who stole his employer's money, or even of a conflict between an aging sheriff and a heartless killer. The war that resides here is that of ideas. On one hand, we have the idea that holds tightly to a belief that evil needs a reason and follows a code, however shady that code might be, and combating such an evil follows a line of logic. On the other, we have a thoughtless method of killing, where life has no value, and one's death resides as easily on the flip of a coin. It's in this film where the conflict of those two ideas converge, and as reality sets in on Jones' character and those around him, it's clear that evil no longer follows anything, and that some are incapable of rational thought or the slimmest forms of mercy.No Country For Old Men is a difficult, but probably necessary watch for those who study the nature of man and the combating elements which confound logical thought. It's also an excellent piece of cinema. I've never in my life been on the edge of my seat during so many scenes, or at the same time found myself not caring for any of the characters, except perhaps the Carla Jean Moss character. Even she, however, seems just another pawn in a deeper study on the nature of man and the things we'd hope we are as opposed to the things we actually exhibit.",5,When old-school ethics face a violence without reason.,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,2893,"['opening', 'scene', 'one', 'more', 'powerful', 'voice-overs', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'film', 'voice', 'humanity', 'scratchy', 'lines', 'raw', 'buring', 'outlook', 'haunt', 'vintage', 'sheriff', 'type', 'played', 'voiced', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'gainst', 'oldtimers', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'would', ""'ve"", 'operated', 'times', 'was', 'boy', 'sent', 'gas', 'chamber', 'Huntsville', 'here', 'while', 'back', 'arrest', 'testimony', 'killed', 'fourteen-year-old', 'girl', 'Papers', 'said', 'was', 'crime', 'passion', 'told', 'was', ""n't"", 'passion', 'Told', ""'d"", 'been', 'planning', 'kill', 'somebody', 'about', 'as', 'long', 'could', 'remember', 'Said', 'turned', 'out', ""'d"", 'do', 'again', 'Said', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'hell', 'Be', 'there', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'surely', 'do', ""n't"", 'crime', 'see', 'now', 'hard', 'even', 'take', 'measure', 'not', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'always', 'knew', 'had', 'be', 'willing', 'die', 'even', 'do', 'job', 'not', 'be', 'glorious', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'push', 'chips', 'forward', 'go', 'out', 'meet', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'go', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'crazy', '*become', 'part', 'it*', 'series', 'voice-over', 'encapsulates', 'film', 'point', 'longer', 'reason', 'probably', 'never', 'did', 'only', 'now', 'more', 'prevalent', 'old', 'ways', 'handling', 'evil', 'Well', ""'re"", 'are', 'finished', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'anymore.So', 'film', 'war', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'pitted', 'man', 'who', 'stole', 'employer', 'money', 'even', 'conflict', 'aging', 'sheriff', 'heartless', 'killer', 'war', 'here', 'ideas', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'idea', 'tightly', 'belief', 'reason', 'code', 'however', 'shady', 'code', 'might', 'be', 'combating', 'such', 'evil', 'line', 'logic', 'other', 'have', 'thoughtless', 'method', 'killing', 'where', 'life', 'value', 'one', 'death', 'resides', 'easily', 'flip', 'coin', 'film', 'where', 'conflict', 'two', 'ideas', 'converge', 'reality', 'sets', 'Jones', 'character', 'clear', 'longer', 'anything', 'are', 'incapable', 'rational', 'thought', 'slimmest', 'forms', 'mercy.No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'difficult', 'probably', 'necessary', 'watch', 'who', 'study', 'nature', 'man', 'combating', 'elements', 'confound', 'logical', 'thought', 'also', 'excellent', 'piece', 'cinema', ""'ve"", 'never', 'life', 'been', 'edge', 'seat', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'same', 'time', 'found', 'not', 'caring', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'Carla', 'Jean', 'Moss', 'character', 'Even', 'however', 'just', 'pawn', 'deeper', 'study', 'nature', 'man', 'things', ""'d"", 'hope', 'are', 'opposed', 'things', 'actually', 'exhibit']",N/A

It is, but it is as far removed from the ""thriller"" category as ""Unforgiven"" was removed from the ""Cowboy Western"".Essentially this play is a reversion to the form of Great Tragedy.  It aspires to the ranks of a modern Hamlet or Macbeth or something from Aeschylus.  At the heart is the question of Evil... its prevalence and its persistence.  The sheriff (Jones)is ultimately torn and ultimately defeated by it.  He comes from a long line of evil-fighters (Sheriffs)who have been wounded and killed in the fight... but they never win.  Evil returns, it isn't defeated, and God doesn't answer.  That's a lot to chew on but it is the only way to profit from the ending.I think it is clear why this movie is not a ""thriller.""  The personification of Evil (played exquisitely by Javier Bardem) is unstoppable and omniscient.  He knows where his prey is at all times, he knows who has been sent against him (Harrelson), he is unstoppable and unflappable.  He is not Satan...

Note the cinematography, showing Dodge Ram and Ford Granada hood ornaments lovingly and prominently.  And then we have our protagonist...Anton's m'name, and fate's m'game.Ya gotta love a guy who loves his work like this.  The obsessive assassin in this wonderful (if not heartwarming) film is named Anton Chigurh.Characters have a hard time pronouncing it.  Some have it rhyming with ""sugar.""  It looks like it should sound like ""chigger"" and, to be honest, that would make a lot more sense.  Like chigger bites.The Coens lavish so much attention on acts of violence and their aftermath.  But, as one character says, Anton has his principles - this is not about violence serving cheap avarice.  Anton is an agent and servant of fate.  His particular insanity transcends greed (unlike the bad guys in Fargo).Anton's purpose for existence is to kill.  If he was former Special Ops, he fulfilled his existential position there.  Too bad he was honorably discharged.  Without commanders to direct his killing competency, he must somehow direct himself.  And it's a job he embraces and enjoys.I just love the last scene he's in - random fate deals him a low card, but it has absolutely nothing to do with justice at all.To quote from Sam Spade's ""Flitcraft"" narrative in ""The Maltese Falcon,"" it's as though someone lifted the lid from life and let us look at the works.  Life is filled with randomness.  It is also malevolent, replete with loss and people who are fulfilled by destruction and killing.  Anton's greatest resonance is that, honestly, there's a little bit of Anton in everyone.But we're the sheriff's dad, too.  You didn't like the ending?

Movies such as ""Raising Arizona"" and ""O' Brother Where Art Thou?"" come to mind first, though I know there are others. ""No Country For Old Men"" is a major, major departure, from the funny yet smart films of before and is a pretty violent thriller, that seems frightfully realistic in some parts.The movie takes place in about 1980 and is about a hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin ""American Gangster"") who finds a case of sorts full of money about $2 million and violence quickly follows as it is drug money from a deal gone bad. There's some drug dealers after the cash, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones ""The Fugitive"") trying to string together clues to a series of brutal murders that are caused by a vicious and I mean vicous killer named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Moss goes on the run with the cash after sending his wife Carla Jean (Kelly MacDonald, ""Nanny McPhee"".This sounds like a typical thriller, but the drug dealing really takes a back seat to the Coen's brilliant storytelling of how Moss tries to keep the cash and stay alive as all these people are coming after it. Also Jones has some great scenes trying to figure out the crime and dealing with the prospect of retirement after this last big case (don't all retiring cops have this happen to them in the movies). It's also interesting to see how Bardem's character has layers to him but is really just a cold blooded killer at heart.There's more to the story but I'll leave it at that. There are plenty of good scenes throughout, the opening few are great as they show Bardem's sick nature, Brolin's are good as well as you feel some sympathy for him, but also feel he is getting what he deserved. The best actor in the film by far is Javier Bardem, he truly shines as a legit scary killer (at least in my mind it's legit). The pacing is great, the violence is a bit shocking in some places and the story and dialogue are very well written. He really deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, very superb performance.

Poss,"[1, 6]","As a long-time fan of Cormac McCarthy, I was thrilled when I found out that the Coen brothers were developing No Country for Old Men for the big screen. I was thrilled when I finally saw the film, and thrilled again when it won Best Picture a few weeks ago.No Country for Old Men does an astonishing thing--it takes a novel by a master writer and makes little or no change to it beyond streamlining into two hours. The characters, plot, and even the dialogue are created completely from McCarthy's source material. It's very rare that an adaptation like this comes along, and it shows the Coens' skill as storytellers that they knew there was nothing to improve.That said, this film's DVD release is great.Picture: Beautiful--the DVD sharply recreates Roger Deakin's cinematography with good contrast and color. I'm also pleased that this is only available in widescreen, as it should be.Sound: Also beautiful. The Coens are well known for the meticulous sound design of their films, and the DVD does them justice.Extras: While I was praying the Coens--or at least some of the actors--would do a commentary track, there is none. This isn't a strike against the DVD by any means, though. In addition to the film there are three behind the scenes extras, all of which were well-done and interesting even if the last, ""Diary of a Country Sheriff,"" is a bit short.Overall, while this may not be the exhaustively-documented special edition consumers have come to expect, the focus of the DVD--the film itself--is perfectly presented with just enough special features to complement it.

85119,A75MSQQ3LN86Z,0788882988,Josef Bush,"[1, 4]","This is a certain kind of B movie of the Genre of the menacing, irrational killer stalking through our neighborhoods.  Both Alan Ladd and Richard Widmark began their careers playing the psychopath role.  Laird Cregar and many others have had a go at it, and not the last or least of which was Anthony Hopkins of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Hannibal Lector series.  And let's not forget Swartzenekker's TERMINATOR series.In this case Louis L'Amour melds with Cormac McCarthy in a tale of the borderlands.  The characters are as simple as they are in L'Amour, as pasteboard and the language as spare and typical as they are here.  And many of the key characters are the same; not quite two dimensional.  (It's a Western ferkrissake.  Let's not get too pretensious.)  Naturally, there's a Sheriff, played by everybody's favorite Tommy Lee, in the role he's played to perfection through most of his professoinal career.The ""wife"" of the ""hero"" is as you'd expect; right out of central casting.  Gangly, whiney, raw-boned pretty in a trailer park kind of way.  And her husband, Josh Brolin's occasionally employed good ole boy antelope hunter is much as you'd expect.  What gives the film its bite are the thumbnail character pieces played by perhaps non-professional hired-on-the-spot Texas actors, in what look to be true locations; hotel and motel lobbies and bedrooms; filling station offices and the like.  Even a Mexican hospital ward in a town across from or close to El Paso.  It all has a great authentic feel to it, and the atmosphere doesn't let up even for a minute.  If you know that part of the country, or the highway, then its as familiar and ocnvincing as nature and bad fortune made it.  But, if its a trip into an unknown part of the country -- and that part of Texas is as exotic in its way as any Polynesian atoll -- then the shock of the new is or can be paralyzing.The Coen Brothers are given to tales of domestic terror and confusion, often involving large, dangerous men and random violence.  This is no exception.  OLD MEN is a boogie-man show, only instead of John Goodman (of BARTON FINK and THE GREAT LEBOWSKI, or that long-haired blonde from FARGO, we have Javier Bardem as the inexorable dread; he who cannot be jived with.  That's very interesting, not only because this is essentially a tale of drug smuggling and violence on the border, but because Bardem, a Spaniard, has been chosen to portray something of the bottomless terror anglos feel toward armed Mexicans.  It's reasonable, in a sence, because they've painted his face with an unattractive coat of putty-colored paint, and instructed him to act without any facial expression, and without any physical expression of individuality.  And, his hair is combed in an entirely peculiar, prim way; kind of a central-european Wild-An-Crazy-Guy paige boy.  He looks like a thug from a Chaplin silent.  It makes no sense, but that's the purpose.  He is intended to embody the Coen Brother's version of McCarthy's nameless, mindless violence.  (The Drug thing.)  And it works for as long as you watch it.  But...  The spell dissipates when you realize that Bardem is in fact, an unusually attractive, handsome and athletic man.  That fact shines through his dumb get-up, and to such a degree that one finds oneself wondering when we're likely to see him in a movie that will feature him as the Leading Man he so obviously is?No, McCarthy's would-be bardic recitation or re-hashing of greasy spoon morning talk overheard or shared with the local Border Patrol as they begin their morning tours at a local El Paso cafe is only modestly successful.  Yes, Drug Dealers and their like are dangerous, and intercourse with them of often fatal, but this is nothing new along the Texas-Mexico border, and hasn't been for over a hundred and fifty years.  That dealing with one's fear of it, or losing one's nerve, is bound to come to any lawman who nears retirement age and hopes to enjoy his final years in the company of his wife and family, is neither new nor fantastic.  No.OLD MEN is a shoot-em-up with strong local flavor that gives one a convincing sense of what it means to trek over the sandy places on either side of the Rio Grande, armed or unarmed, and gives the viewer a good idea of what it may feel like to be a target in open country.  Or to confront somebody who is as likely to kill you as not: Somebody who'd kill you for your Timex, or less.  It's rather like finding yourself past midnight and utterly lost in the unlit and stinking back alleys of Tijuana, and hearing footsteps behind you and angry men's voices.Still it borders mediocre, rather than Mexico.",4,WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,4645,"['certain', 'kind', 'B', 'movie', 'Genre', 'menacing', 'irrational', 'killer', 'stalking', 'neighborhoods', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'began', 'careers', 'playing', 'psychopath', 'role', 'Laird', 'Cregar', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'had', 'go', 'not', 'last', 'least', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'THE', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'series', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Swartzenekker', 'TERMINATOR', 'series.In', 'case', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'melds', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'tale', 'borderlands', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'simple', 'are', ""L'Amour"", 'pasteboard', 'language', 'spare', 'typical', 'are', 'here', 'many', 'key', 'characters', 'are', 'same', 'not', 'quite', 'two', 'dimensional', 'Western', 'ferkrissake', 'Let', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'pretensious', 'Naturally', 'Sheriff', 'played', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'role', 'played', 'perfection', 'most', 'professoinal', 'career.The', 'wife', 'hero', ""'d"", 'expect', 'right', 'central', 'casting', 'Gangly', 'whiney', 'raw-boned', 'pretty', 'trailer', 'park', 'kind', 'way', 'husband', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'occasionally', 'employed', 'good', 'ole', 'antelope', 'hunter', 'much', ""'d"", 'expect', 'What', 'film', 'bite', 'are', 'thumbnail', 'character', 'pieces', 'played', 'perhaps', 'non-professional', 'hired-on-the-spot', 'Texas', 'actors', 'what', 'look', 'be', 'true', 'locations', 'hotel', 'motel', 'lobbies', 'bedrooms', 'filling', 'station', 'offices', 'like', 'Even', 'Mexican', 'hospital', 'ward', 'town', 'close', 'El', 'Paso', 'great', 'authentic', 'feel', 'atmosphere', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'even', 'minute', 'know', 'part', 'country', 'highway', 'then', 'familiar', 'ocnvincing', 'nature', 'bad', 'fortune', 'made', 'trip', 'unknown', 'part', 'country', 'part', 'Texas', 'exotic', 'way', 'Polynesian', 'atoll', 'then', 'shock', 'new', 'can', 'be', 'paralyzing.The', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'are', 'given', 'tales', 'domestic', 'terror', 'confusion', 'often', 'involving', 'large', 'dangerous', 'men', 'random', 'violence', 'exception', 'OLD', 'MEN', 'boogie-man', 'show', 'only', 'instead', 'John', 'Goodman', 'BARTON', 'FINK', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'LEBOWSKI', 'long-haired', 'blonde', 'FARGO', 'have', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'inexorable', 'dread', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'jived', 'very', 'interesting', 'not', 'only', 'essentially', 'tale', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'violence', 'border', 'Bardem', 'Spaniard', 'been', 'chosen', 'portray', 'something', 'bottomless', 'terror', 'anglos', 'feel', 'armed', 'Mexicans', 'reasonable', 'sence', ""'ve"", 'painted', 'face', 'unattractive', 'coat', 'putty-colored', 'paint', 'instructed', 'act', 'facial', 'expression', 'physical', 'expression', 'individuality', 'hair', 'combed', 'entirely', 'peculiar', 'prim', 'way', 'kind', 'central-european', 'Wild-An-Crazy-Guy', 'paige', 'boy', 'thug', 'Chaplin', 'silent', 'sense', 'purpose', 'intended', 'embody', 'Coen', 'Brother', 'version', 'McCarthy', 'nameless', 'mindless', 'violence', 'Drug', 'thing', 'as', 'long', 'watch', 'spell', 'when', 'realize', 'Bardem', 'fact', 'unusually', 'attractive', 'handsome', 'athletic', 'man', 'fact', 'dumb', 'get-up', 'such', 'degree', 'one', 'wondering', 'when', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'feature', 'Leading', 'Man', 'so', 'obviously', 'No', 'McCarthy', 'would-be', 'bardic', 'recitation', 're-hashing', 'greasy', 'spoon', 'morning', 'talk', 'overheard', 'shared', 'local', 'Border', 'Patrol', 'begin', 'morning', 'tours', 'local', 'El', 'Paso', 'cafe', 'only', 'modestly', 'successful', 'Yes', 'Drug', 'Dealers', 'like', 'are', 'dangerous', 'intercourse', 'often', 'fatal', 'nothing', 'new', 'Texas-Mexico', 'border', ""n't"", 'been', 'hundred', 'fifty', 'years', 'dealing', 'one', 'fear', 'losing', 'one', 'nerve', 'bound', 'come', 'lawman', 'who', 'retirement', 'age', 'enjoy', 'final', 'years', 'company', 'wife', 'family', 'new', 'fantastic', 'No.OLD', 'MEN', 'shoot-em-up', 'strong', 'local', 'flavor', 'one', 'convincing', 'sense', 'what', 'trek', 'sandy', 'places', 'side', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'armed', 'unarmed', 'viewer', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'may', 'feel', 'be', 'target', 'open', 'country', 'confront', 'somebody', 'who', 'as', 'likely', 'kill', 'not', 'Somebody', 'who', ""'d"", 'kill', 'Timex', 'less', 'rather', 'like', 'finding', 'past', 'midnight', 'utterly', 'lost', 'unlit', 'stinking', 'back', 'alleys', 'Tijuana', 'hearing', 'footsteps', 'angry', 'men', 'voices.Still', 'mediocre', 'rather', 'Mexico']",N/A

85128,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,0788882988,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 4]","When I visited my local video store recently I was having a difficult time deciding on what movie I wished to see. Several new titles of interest had been released, yet I knew that there were still some from earlier in the year that I had yet to watch. This thought led to a new problem for me, choosing which not-so new release to pick up. After much internal debating with myself, I finally decided I wanted something that had some substance to it, and wasn't going to be a movie where I could just turn my brain off and watch it. I wanted a movie that was going to demand my attention, thus I decided I would pick the film chosen as Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards, the critically acclaimed ""No Country for Old Men"", written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"").""No Country for Old Men"" follows an intense couple of days for a man named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who happens to come across a drug deal gone bad and discovers for himself two million dollars in cash. However, taking the money may just prove to be the biggest mistake in his entire life. As a sadistic killer (Javier Bardem) is hot on his trail, and leaving a mess of dead bodies in his wake, the likes of which the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) and the West Texas area has never seen.If there's one thing I can say with the utmost certainty about ""No Country for Old Men"", it's that this is definitely one film that demands your attention, and if you get too distracted at any point you will quickly become lost in the intricately detailed story. With that in mind, even though I gave the movie my undivided attention, I still found myself somewhat confounded by the events in the closing moments of the movie. For roughly 85% of the film I was right there with it every step of the way, perfectly understanding everything, but in the final five to ten minutes it just got strange for me, and I didn't quite understand how it had ended. I do believe that I have a decent grasp on it now, having given more thought to the film and even re-watching the final moments, but even with my newfound understanding, it's still a strange and disappointing ending to what appeared to be a superb film.That brings me to my problem with this film; I was really into the story and thought that perhaps this was going to be a movie that I would want in my collection, but the ending ruined it for me. For starters I'm somewhat surprised by the fact that I even remotely enjoyed ""No Country for Old Men"", because lately it seems that most Best Picture winners and nominees for the Oscars tend to be these high-brow dramas that don't appeal to me in the least, yet here was the most recent winner enthralling me with its excellent storytelling. I thought the many concepts that the film dealt with, such as fate and/or destiny (which the killer, Anton Chigurh, mentions to many of his victims), the depravity of society as reflected by the more sadistic killers being unleashed upon the world, or how pride always comes before a fall, were all very well presented and thought provoking. Yet, as great as the story was, the extremely unsatisfactory final act and resultant ending that left me puzzled, managed to bring the entire movie to its knees. I believe I am a smart man, and I can't remember the last time that I watched a movie that left me feeling so stupid because of my inability to grasp what I had just seen, but that's how this movie made me feel. I understand that the Coen brothers are extremely talented and smart writers, no argument there, but perhaps they could have rethought the final portion of this movie. Not necessarily changing all the events, but at least the final moments that confused me, and from what I've heard, it did the same for many other viewers as well.As far as the acting goes every single performance was fantastic, not a single one felt out of place or off the mark in any way. Josh Brolin (""W."") convincingly portrays just a down-home, good ol' country boy who just so happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and allowed his pride to stand in the way of finding the means to save himself. Veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones once again portrays a law enforcement official, something he has done all too often since winning an Academy Award for ""The Fugitive"". At least in this movie Tommy didn't play the same old guy as he has so many times before. This time around he played an aging lawman who is struggling desperately to find relevance for his brand of justice in a world that has become so dark that it may have passed him by. Javier Bardem (""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") delivered a chilling performance as killer Anton Chigurh, a man who believes killing to be a perfectly natural solution to any problem, no matter who or what may be involved. Lastly, Woody Harrelson (""Semi-Pro"") gives a surprisingly strong supporting performance as a man hired to track down Chigurh and stop him by any means necessary. I personally never thought Woody could act all that well, but he definitely brought his A-game to the table in this picture.""No Country for Old Men"" is one of those instances in movies where virtually every element works perfectly together to create an engrossing experience. From the superbly written screenplay, thought-provoking ideas and concepts, and excellent performances, this movie delivers in almost every way imaginable; however, the troublesome final act of the film brings the movie crashing down amidst a cacophony of confusion and disappointment. It's such an unfortunate fate for such a promising film.""No Country for Old Men"" is rated R for violence and language.",3,A Great Movie That Is Ruined By Its Ending...,1229040000,"12 12,

But, I am not sure I even understood it.There are some truly wonderful points about this film.  The acting is outstanding.  Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem all give stellar performances.  You love Tommy as the country sheriff; you root for Josh Brolin all the way, and Javier Bardem is an extremely creepy bad guy.  There is also a great cast of tremendous supporting actors, who all give marvelous performances. The settings are authentic - there is no question that you are in rural Texas.  The cinematography adds to the feeling of desert and desolation.However, the plot is all over the place.  It SEEMS to be about the hunt for a psychopathic killer.  It SEEMS to be about the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad.  It SEEMS to be about the life of an old country sheriff in rural Texas.However, based on the odd, unfinished, unsatisfying end of this film, where TLJ is explaining the dreams he had the night before to his wife, the summation of the actual story appears to be ""life sucks, and then you die.""

If you were lucky enough to correctly select the outcome of the coin toss, the killer would just hand you the coin possibly suggesting you save it and leave.

It doesn't pull any punches, doesn't sell itself out or wind up in a Hollywood fantasy ending. It is stark, violent, desperate and a bit nostalgic. An old time county sheriff(Tommy Lee Jones, brilliant in a laconic way) yearns for the days when the bad guys could be contained and caught without alot of violence. He could always solve a case without every using a gun but these days there is no limit to the violence(embodied by Javier Bardem's brilliant portrayal). Josh Brolin's character is out hunting and comes across a drug deal gone bad with bodies littered across the stark desert. A lone man is alive and begs him for water but he doesn't have any and takes off after finding a bag of money. But his conscience tears at him and he does the unthinkable even though he knows it is a stupid thing to do. He goes back to the scene of the crime to bring water to the man who by now is dead and he is seen by the drug bosses and the chase begins.

No one--absolutely no one--could've played Sheriff Tom Ed Bell better than Tommy Lee Jones.  Likewise, Javier Bardem brings Anton Chirgurh to life with such low-key intensity that you find yourself literally terrified of him, even though you know he's a fictional character.The cinematography eerily captures the minimalism of the book:  the shots of empty desert, long patches of on-screen silence, and absolute absence of musical score.I generally think that comparing the merits and weaknesses of novels and the films made from them is a fruitless enterprise.

The main characters in No Country for Old Men - as different as they are - have this one thing in common: they are all chasing something they want.For our main character, Lewellyn Moss, opportunity is unexpectedly siezed when he stumbles onto a drug sale gone awry, giving him access to the unguarded spoils. Our villian - and what a villian he is! - Chugurh, is chasing after the very same thing as Moss; the difference is that the money, or so we ascertain, used to belong to Chugurh. Both of these characters are headed for a collision; we see them slowly dance around eachother. Meanwhile, Sheriff Bell, our third character, is looking for both of these men, but what he really wants is to get out of the whole game. Where as some want to be where the action is, others strive to be where the action is not.This film is a very slow film - slow in a tense, forward-moving kind of way. We watch these three characters - loser, villian, and sheriff - slowly and softly feel each other out like boxers in the first two minutes of the fight., waiting to deal a blow we all know is coming. And come it does.The film is graphic, but not horrifically so. For those who like watching villians, this film packs one of the best in Chugurh, a former special operative who is as ruthless and heartless as he is smart and kiniving. Lewellyn Moss, on the other hand, will come off like an ambling fool doing the best he can with the hand he dealt to himself (it was not dealt to him; after all, he was the one who grabbed the money). Sheriff Bell is simply trying to keep it from going haywire but, alas, often finds himself at least a step behind the pack.Character film; suspense film; western? You can call this film all three in at least some sense. There is suspense and action, but there is also some good depth.

85144,A30TK6U7DNS82R,0788882988,Kevin Killian,"[5, 16]","I've read that they are trying to land Christian Bale for the starring part in the upcoming TERMINATOR SALVATION, but someone tell the producers to line up Javier Bardem, Spain's most popular star, to play his robotic unstoppable super-rival.  This is the best Terminator picture since the original one.  By far!  Bardem does things with an air gun that you never saw Schwarzenegger even try to attempt.  We saw this movie over the Thanksgiving holiday with a friend, and all of us were sitting gripping the arms of our chairs white-knuckled, so tensed up with suspense we were hyperventilating.I liked Javier Bardem when he played Cuban in BEFORE NIGHT FALLS, the Reinaldo Arenas story, but here he plays a man called Anton Chigurh (Josh Brolin twitches when he hears the name, snorts ""Sugar?"" as though to underscore how evil a man could have so sweet a name), who is charged with getting back $2 million dollars in drug money.  Josh stumbles onto this cache of money, packed neatly into a highly distinctive portfolio bag, whilst out deer hunting on a lazy day somewhere on the Texas Mexico border.  Not far away, Tommy Lee Jones as the state's most seen it all sheriff contemplates happy retirement with Tess Harper, both of them made up to show they've spent too much time in the sun.  The movie's set in 1980, not too long ago on the calendar, but let's face it, any movie set in the past before cell phones and the internet is going to seem like it's from the distant Old West past.  When a motel has a sign, ""Free HBO,"" or another character refers to an ATM, at first you think it's some sort of anachronism, like seeing that wristwatch on Moses' wrist in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, then you stop and think, well maybe they did have HBO and ATMs back in 1980 but otherwise, you're just left wondering why did they bother trying to situate the story back 27 years?  It would have played just as well in today's era, or slightly in the future like the other Terminator movies.  Maybe this one is like a prequel of sorts, only it's not an origin story, instead Chigurh seems fully formed and totally evil from the very first time he ambles onto the screen, in his moptop Beatles haircut and dragging that oxygen tank.  He doesn't say much, but what he says is packed full of contempt for human nature, as befits his slightly monstrous physical makeup.  The Coen Brothers, whose dialogue is often self-reflexive to the point of being goofy, here play it down a bit and keep it on the level of the famous ""Hasta la vista, baby"" quips Arnold fired off in parts 1 and 2.I didn't really understand why they (or author Cormac McCarthy called it NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, but apparently it comes from Yeats' poem ""Sailing to Byzantium,"" which became early on a rallying cry for the cyborg movement with its repeated please to leave the human behind and move into a post-human re-mix.  ""Once out of nature I shall never take/ My bodily form from any natural thing.""Some of the action setpieces here rival the ones James Cameron dreamed up for the original movies.  The very first one, even before Javier Bardem shows up, has Josh Brolin catapulting down a rocksliding hill and slamming belly first into a quickmoving river while a feral dog races after him only a nip away from his butt the whole time.  Ferocious action filmmaking at its finest.  My favorite part was on line waiting for tickets for the show and the guy in front of me asked for two for ""No Country Music for Old Men.""

Having missed it in theaters, I managed to catch it a couple of weeks ago at my neighbors' house.  Honestly, other than knowing it had won the Best Picture Oscar, I really didn't have a clue what the movie was about before watching it, other than having something to do with a drug deal gone wrong.  The story grabs the viewer right from the beginning, and slowly you start to piece together what is going on.  I like it when directors allow me to use my brain to figure things out, instead of just spoon feeding me the plot.  As the film progressed, I became more and more involved with the characters and the story.  When we took a popcorn break, we discussed how much we were enjoying the movie, and how surprised we all were that it was this good.  The cinematography is really something to see in this film.  It's not Lawrence of Arabia good, but it is quality work.  The acting is solid from the leads to the supporting cast.  Tommy Lee Jones never disappoints, and Javier Bardem, whom I had never seen before, gives a truly chilling performance.  Bardem's acting prowess was such that I have begun to search out his previous films.  So with all this praise, why do I not give this movie a perfect score???  THAT is my quandary.  While 98% of the movie blew me away, it's the ending.....or lack of one, that leaves me a little disappointed.  Just when things seemed to be headed for a rewarding climax, it ends.  This left me with MANY unanswered questions.  But as time has passed I have asked myself it that was the intention of the creators of the film, because even though we were all not happy with the ending, we have discussed what we thought happened since our viewing.  If I could give it 3.5 stars I would.  It is a great piece of film, but it was just personally disappointing to me because of the ending.  If you don't mind getting lead to the edge of a precipice and being left there to hang, then you will LOVE this movie.",3,??????????,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,2009,"['really', 'must', 'admit', ""'m"", 'torn', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'Having', 'missed', 'theaters', 'managed', 'catch', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'neighbors', 'house', 'Honestly', 'other', 'knowing', 'had', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'other', 'having', 'something', 'do', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'story', 'viewer', 'right', 'beginning', 'slowly', 'start', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'going', 'like', 'when', 'directors', 'allow', 'use', 'brain', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'instead', 'just', 'spoon', 'feeding', 'plot', 'film', 'progressed', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'involved', 'characters', 'story', 'When', 'took', 'popcorn', 'break', 'discussed', 'how', 'much', 'were', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'how', 'surprised', 'were', 'was', 'good', 'cinematography', 'really', 'something', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'good', 'quality', 'work', 'acting', 'solid', 'leads', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'never', 'disappoints', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'whom', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'truly', 'chilling', 'performance', 'Bardem', 'acting', 'prowess', 'was', 'such', 'have', 'begun', 'search', 'out', 'previous', 'films', 'So', 'praise', 'why', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'movie', 'perfect', 'score', 'quandary', '98', '%', 'movie', 'blew', 'away', 'ending', '..or', 'lack', 'one', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Just', 'when', 'things', 'seemed', 'be', 'headed', 'rewarding', 'climax', 'left', 'MANY', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'time', 'passed', 'have', 'asked', 'was', 'intention', 'creators', 'film', 'even', 'were', 'not', 'happy', 'ending', 'have', 'discussed', 'what', 'thought', 'happened', 'viewing', 'could', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'would', 'great', 'piece', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'personally', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'getting', 'lead', 'edge', 'precipice', 'being', 'left', 'hang', 'then', 'will', 'LOVE', 'movie']",N/A

Did you get what the story is really about; do you only like popcorn films; and, can you take strong violence?  On the surface, No Country tells the story of a sheriff and Vietnam vet in Texas in 1980.  What the story is really about is violence, fate, self reflection, fear and death.  Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is about to retire.  He feels overmathced and outdated.  West Texas is no lounger the quiet safe place it once was.  He is struggling to make sense of how violent and senseless the world is becoming.  As he says some the old time sheriffs didn't carry guns.  Vietnam vet Lewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) just needs a break; he is a welder who lives in a trailer with his wife.  He thinks he's gotten his break when he stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad and finds a case of money.  Unfortantly as the tagline says 'there are no clean getaways'.  Enter the hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) sent to recover the money.  No Country For Old Men is a story full of layers and hidden meanings.  It features a lot of brilliant acting; Javier Bardem is as chilling a villian as ever played.  Like I said, its not a film for everyone.

He figures he'll be followed and he's right; Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a ruthless and patient killer, is after him.  Chigurh is, in turn, being tracked by the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones), a good ol' country boy who's amazed at how violent criminals have become lately.I'd heard this was a bloody guy-movie so I watched it grudgingly, but I actually liked it a lot.  Yes, it's got a high body count but the violence wasn't off-putting and the cat-and-mouse tale is spell-binding.  The tension stays at 100% throughout and is really frightening.

In the back of one truck is the motherload of heroin.  While searching for more clues, he comes across a satchel with $2 million cash.  From then on he's a man who's taking it step by step to find out exactly how to get away with keeping this money while not getting caught.  His conscience gets the best of him when he decides to do a good deed.  Instead, he finds he should have left well enough alone.He then decides to leave everything while sending his adoring wife away to safety, he's caught in a cat and mouse game with the brutal and sadistic Anton Chigurh.  Javier Bardem plays the ruthless assassin with such unflinching ease and brilliance from the opening scene, it's truly frightening.Tommy Lee Jones plays an old-timer sheriff of the sleepy Texas town in which this horror has taken place. He has seen more than his share of heartache and violence.  The state of the world is perhaps too much for him to handle anymore.When I saw this Coen Brothers modern masterpiece for the first time, I summerized it as: 'Fargo' of the Southwest.  The dialogue is beautiful in its own special way.  Simplistic dialect and jargon of the area is used with such panache and style it's often hilarious.The cinematography is just stunning. The vast open desert areas allows the feeling of loniless while whenever Bardem is on screen, the chilling claustorphobia takes over.While it may not be a movie made for everyone's taste, it is certainly a very tense thriller.  Violence is certainly not shied away from.  The subtle performances of the cast are amazing.  As far as I'm concerned, any member of the cast earned an award or two.The ending may throw people.  I'm not going to elaborate here because each individual needs to make their conclusion.  It's not a neat little package that's wrapped up in a nice epilogue.

The painting affects him in his stomach, which, being far from his head, means that the painting is good because it works on a visceral level.&#34;No Country for Old Men&#34; works in the same way. The character we end up rooting for is the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh. Chigurh lives by a strict code (the coin toss) which he will never violate. He is neither brave nor foolish, but so certain of his own competence, that he sees all obstacles as nothing more than interesting puzzles. He is the embodiment of Nietzsche's superman, who creates his own morality. Of the other potential heroes, they either get in over their heads (Llewellyn Moss, and the Woody Harrelson character), or they give up (the sheriff). Chigurh's preferred weapon (a captive bolt pistol) and even his hair style shows his freedom from convention and the need to conform to others' expectations. Even his name puts him outside of normal society. &#34;Anton&#34; is vaguely European, but &#34;Chigurh&#34; is of uncertain ethnic origin, seemingly from a part of Europe or Asia we are unfamiliar with. He could be Turkish, or Bulgarian, or Uzbek, or Georgian, or something else.We admire him because he is free, but his freedom comes at the cost of a trail of blood and destruction.

85162,A2T049UQONS0OY,0788882988,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 2]","I heard a lot of bad stuff about this flick from my friends before I saw it -- that is wasn't Oscar-worthy, that is was same old-same old Coen brothers, that it broke no new ground, that is was slow and crawled at a worm's pace. Much of this is true but, having recently seen Oscar-nominated film ""Michael Clayton"" and the even slower and more boring ""Atonement"", I would suggest the Motion Picture Academy made a wise choice handing the statuette to this movie.""No Country for Old Men"" is a Western reinvented in 1980 and crosses paradigms between post-Vietnam angst (both main characters, the hunter and hunted, are veterans of the conflict) and the coming Reaganomics of the era, where personal self-indulgence and winning at all costs was the mantra of making money in the 1980s.If you haven't seen the film, a hunter goes out to dusty rural Texas one day and stumbles upon a drug deal where everyone is shot up. He finds $2 million and a game begins between him and two other gents wanting the money. It's not clear from the film what role each protagonist played in the drug deal -- one is a bounty hunter after the dough while the other seems to have had some role in the shoot em up -- but both want the money. One is the lead character, a bad dude that dislikes everyone and sheds a lot of blood throuhgout the film.As is their wont, the Coens throw in another character and star -- Tommy Lee Jones as the local aging sheriff -- to mix up the bubbling cauldron. Put this all together and you have an old fahsioned cowboy chase film shot in modern day Texas using picup trucks and SUVs as substitutes for horses and covered wagons.One of my favorites parts of this movie is the silencer the bad guy uses on his shotgun that looks like a tin can. Boy, is that thing funny! He uses it to good affect throughout, offing about 15 people in his bloodthirstry search for the money. One of my least favorite parts is the Coens' inability to tie a knot at the end of the film, which ends the same way ""The Sopranos"" TV series ended -- inconclusively. You have no idea what happened to anyone still alive or the $2 million.That shortcoming aside, this is an interesting, involving and intellingent film made from a book that is the Coens first real suspenser since ""Blood Simple"" in 1984. It has much of that film's aura, pace and design and, as such, represents a return to roots for the Coen brothers. Let's hope they can continue making high quality films and continue leaving George Clooney out of their movies.

He doesn't just lack a conscience, he has his own ""code of honor"" that bids him to revile and destroy those poor humans who make their decisions based on emotion that Chigurh simply cannot understand except as a weakness, a flaw.The movie also depicts the state of our society very well - a society where money and greed lead to drugs and inhumanity to man, and are becoming more and more normalized, part of the landscape.  Meanwhile, Sheriff Ed John Bell, (played by Tommy Lee Jones, the ""old man"", talks about the fact that his country is not what it used to be and doesn't realize that it is just that the same evil still exists, it just wears a different face.  He worries about the drugs and the greed and the horror of what is going on without realizing that all of that is a product of the very government he fought for in WW II.  In the old days, the U.S. government did its dirty work in other countries or behind a mask; now, it comes home to roost. This is indicated by the fact that one of the hired killers of the drug cartel is a former military officer (Wells, played by Woody Harrelson) and the drug cartel itself is a ""big business"" with offices in a high-rise and an accountant. The fact that psychopathic behavior is increasing in America is remarked on by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell who, while reading a newspaper says:""Here last week they found this couple out in California. They rent out rooms for old people, kill'em, bury'em in the yard, cash their social security checks. Well, they'd tortur'em first, I don't know why. Maybe the television set was broke.""The ""regular guy"", Llewelyn Moss played by Josh Brolin, isn't a dummy, but he's no match for the real, live, stalking evil of a psychopath because he does have a conscience and he doesn't have the ability to think like a psychopath - totally without emotion.  In a sense, what happens between Moss and Chigurh is representative of what happens in general, in society, between psychopaths and normal humans, even very smart normal humans, especially when those normal humans think they can take on a psychopath alone. The same could actually be said about Chigurh's former colleague, Wells:Anton Chigurh: And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.Carson Wells: You go to hell.Anton Chigurh: Let me ask you something. If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?Carson Wells: Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?Anton Chigurh: You mean the nature of this conversation?Carson Wells: I mean the nature of you.The psychopath: an unstoppable force of nature.  And that is how this movie depicts them; Agents of fate.Anyway, the whole movie struck me as a metaphor for the increase of psychopathy in our world and its corrupting effect on human society.  It's a horrifying, but accurate picture, and a lot of lessons can be extracted from ""No Country for Old Men"".

It is definitely a different take on a drug deal gone wrong & what may happen when an unlikely character stumbles across the aftermath & takes off with the loot after the drug deal has tragically gone way south.I liked the movie because it was interesting and different than other movies in the same genre. I also liked the contrasts between the violence and dark humor throughout this movie. The acting was superb on all counts by the entire cast members... However, my favorite performances were that of Javier Bardem, whom won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his portrayal of the character, Anton Chigurh, whom I thought was the scariest bad guy I've ever seen in my life!! Tommy Lee Jones was also wonderful in his role of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell & I also enjoyed Kelly MacDonald's performance as Carla Jean Moss.******SPOILER SECTION, SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM DON'T READ WHAT I WRITE NEXT******The only thing I didn't enjoy was the ending of this movie.... I felt like it ended terribly!!!!! Did anyone else feel this way too?????

85167,AYMZTWBG0V53W,0788882988,"Leslie Karen Rigsbey ""Leslie Rigsbey""","[0, 0]","Again, the Coen Brothers prove that they are very much style over substance folks, taking the mental miscarriage that was Cormac McCarthy's original screenplay and refashioning it into a screenplay of their own (they were really working from the popular novel version that was published, but I suspect that they had access to McCarthy's original script before he reworked it as the literary source that this film is based upon). The pacing of the film is interesting, but it's mostly a lot of disgusting violence and bloodshed (some of which is, I confess, entertaining) with some hit and miss performances thrown in. I had high hopes for the Coen Brothers when they began (I remember having fond memories of seeing the bizarre &#34;Blood Simple&#34; for the first time), but in this case they have hijacked the powerful McCarthy story and turned it into a narrative misnomer of a movie. As well photographed as the picture is (by Roger Deakins), there really is not that much to see here except for the violence--and the typical insulting characterizations that Joel and Ethan are known for. Overall, this DVD is fine, but the movie is a headlong plunge into meaninglessness. The film features a bad and way over-the-top performance by Javier Bardem (whose acting coach was a robot, no?), and an outstanding acting job by Brolin. At the very least, this is a more interesting and nihilistic movie than the idiotic &#34;O Brother, Where art Thou?&#34;, but that still doesn't mean it's an essential.

85169,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,0788882988,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[8, 17]","There are two caveats for filmgoers here: 1) If you have any qualms about extreme violence, do NOT see this film, and 2) If you like at least some degree of resolution, ALSO do not see this film.The ending is so unresolved it feels like the film was purposely cut. Maybe it was; maybe it wasn't. And there are scenes here violent enough to align it with a 1980s style horror movie, no question. BUT--the actors are breathtakingly good. Tommie Lee Jones was born for this role of Sheriff Bell; he walks and talks it like a hand-in-glove kinda thing. PERFECT. Javier Bardem as psychopathic Anton Chigurh is really good. After his first two killings, when you see his face for any length of time, it is supremely unsettling. This guy WILL kill you. And Josh Brolin is remarkable. While his past roles have left this viewer really unimpressed, he's come to a major transition point in this film and turns in an astoundingly good performance. He is absolutely riveting--in fact, has my vote for the best actor in the film (in spite of Jones' and Bardem's brilliant performances).And the supporting cast is great--Woody Harrelson, Stephen Root, Tess Harper, and Barry Corbin are all terrific. In fact, it's the acting that drives this movie home. The extremely intense violence is so horrific it's heartbreaking.Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles on a satchel cache of $2 million in a drug deal gone seriously wrong--dead bodies and pickups lying around in the hot Texas semi-desert sun like really old cast-off clothes. He takes the loot and scrambles away from his home. Meanwhile, Chigurh is looking for the money and slaughters anyone who gets in his way, he doesn't like, loses a coin toss, or has something he needs--using a powerful air gun for killing cattle (which is practical since it can both kill people and kick out a door lock).Sheriff Bell knows Moss and finds out he's missing from Moss' wife, goes after him--and finds slaughter and ruination along the way. One of the memorable scenes in the film is when Bell and a Texas lawman crony of his same age (probably early 60s) sit and commiserate with each other about how things are falling apart.Chigurh has an astoundingly uncommon sense of where people are; it's like he has people finding ESP. He tracks Moss; the tension generated in this one-on-one is fierce and tough, but in fact, the whole film is about tracking. Bell is tracking Moss; Chigurh is tracking Moss; Moss is tracking his future with this $2 million.It's too bad there is so much unresolved at the end. This was obviously intentional, but I think it would have been just a little more satisfying if there had been at least some additional resolution. As it is, we are left hanging with so many loose ends it essentially drives you to read the book--by Cormac McCarthy, one of the greatest regional novelists in the US today (probably the greatest, in fact).Very strongly recommended--just watch out for Chigurh's air gun...",4,The two caveats,1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,2946,"['are', 'two', 'caveats', 'filmgoers', 'here', '1', 'have', 'qualms', 'extreme', 'violence', 'do', 'NOT', 'see', 'film', '2', 'like', 'least', 'degree', 'resolution', 'ALSO', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'film.The', 'ending', 'so', 'unresolved', 'film', 'was', 'purposely', 'cut', 'Maybe', 'was', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'are', 'scenes', 'here', 'violent', 'enough', 'align', '1980s', 'style', 'horror', 'movie', 'question', 'BUT', 'actors', 'are', 'breathtakingly', 'good', 'Tommie', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'was', 'born', 'role', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'talks', 'hand-in-glove', 'kinda', 'thing', 'PERFECT', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'psychopathic', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'really', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'killings', 'when', 'see', 'face', 'length', 'time', 'supremely', 'unsettling', 'guy', 'WILL', 'kill', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'remarkable', 'past', 'roles', 'have', 'left', 'viewer', 'really', 'unimpressed', 'come', 'major', 'transition', 'point', 'film', 'astoundingly', 'good', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'fact', 'vote', 'best', 'actor', 'film', 'spite', 'Jones', 'Bardem', 'brilliant', 'performances', '.And', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'are', 'terrific', 'fact', 'acting', 'movie', 'home', 'extremely', 'intense', 'violence', 'so', 'horrific', 'heartbreaking.Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'satchel', 'cache', '2', 'million', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'dead', 'bodies', 'pickups', 'lying', 'around', 'hot', 'Texas', 'semi-desert', 'sun', 'really', 'old', 'cast-off', 'clothes', 'loot', 'away', 'home', 'Meanwhile', 'Chigurh', 'looking', 'money', 'slaughters', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', ""n't"", 'like', 'coin', 'toss', 'something', 'using', 'powerful', 'air', 'gun', 'killing', 'cattle', 'practical', 'can', 'both', 'kill', 'people', 'kick', 'out', 'door', 'lock', '.Sheriff', 'Bell', 'Moss', 'out', 'missing', 'Moss', 'wife', 'slaughter', 'ruination', 'way', 'One', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'when', 'Bell', 'Texas', 'lawman', 'crony', 'same', 'age', 'probably', 'early', '60s', 'sit', 'commiserate', 'other', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'falling', 'apart.Chigurh', 'astoundingly', 'uncommon', 'sense', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'people', 'finding', 'ESP', 'Moss', 'tension', 'generated', 'one-on-one', 'fierce', 'tough', 'fact', 'whole', 'film', 'tracking', 'Bell', 'tracking', 'Moss', 'Chigurh', 'tracking', 'Moss', 'Moss', 'tracking', 'future', '2', 'million.It', 'too', 'bad', 'so', 'much', 'unresolved', 'end', 'was', 'obviously', 'intentional', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'satisfying', 'had', 'been', 'least', 'additional', 'resolution', 'are', 'left', 'hanging', 'so', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'essentially', 'read', 'book', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'one', 'greatest', 'regional', 'novelists', 'US', 'today', 'probably', 'greatest', 'fact', '.Very', 'strongly', 'recommended', 'just', 'watch', 'out', 'Chigurh', 'air', 'gun']",N/A

85171,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,0788882988,lily t.,"[1, 1]","I saw the film in the theaters, then immediately bought the book. Last night I watched it again, loving it as much as I did the first time.Reading the book [and subsequently The Road], I thought Cormac McCarthy had finally let go of his literary pretensions and desire to take up Faulkner's mantle and had come into his own in both these spare, lyrical and powerful late works. The Coens have also matured as filmmakers and interpreted his work beautifully in this neo-western.In 1980, Llewellyn Moss [ Josh Brolin], a survivor of two tours of duty in Viet Nam, is hunting in the desert when he stumbles across the remnants of a bloody shoot-out in a large drug sale gone wrong. Scoping the scene, he picks up a suitcase filled with two million dollars, which he believes will be his salvation [ he and his wife, Carla-Jean live on the edge of poverty in a dilapidated old trailer]. With this action, he sets into motion a series of events which will cause him to go on the run from both psychotic hitman Anton Chiguhr and  bounty hunter Carson Wells [Woody Harrelson], who is sent  by the cartel when they realize Chiguhr is out of control.Perhaps Moss overestimates his own abilities, but he believes he can prevail over his fate as his story narrows on a cross country chase to Mexico. The movie then shifts to world weary sheriff Ed Tom Bell [Tommy Lee Jones] who, while speculating on the nature of evil and violence,  desires both to help Moss and apprehend Chiguhr.Bell sees something happening as a pall of darkness falls across the land and as life, which was so comfortable and secure  in the postwar era, changes, once again reverting to the brutality and chaos that has always pervaded the West since time immemorial. The empty and dry landscape enforces his feelings of doom as Moss, the quintessential working man, who has evaded death in battle, now faces Death in the inconceivable and primeval form of Chigurh. Along the way, the story becomes bigger than itself, and bigger than the story of the last days of America, as it strips itself down to survival and the nature of life itself, bloody and raw.Brilliant direction -- the off scene violence and open end were beautifully done- and the performances by Jones, Bardem, McDonald [ Carla-Jean], and particularly Brolin who has always reminded me of a slower, rawer Kris Kristofferson were outstanding.

85174,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0788882988,Linda Linguvic,"[13, 24]","This film is directed by the famous Coen brothers who also wrote the screenplay adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy.  It is dark and brooding story and the suspense is so thick that it kept me squirming uncomfortably in my seat throughout.  Indeed, it is a fine film, artistic in every way.  It's already won a whole bunch of awards and will certainly make it into the Oscar nominations this year.John Brolin plays the role of Llewelin Moss, a simple working-class welder, and occasional hunter who accidentally comes across a murder scene in the Texas desert.  The inhabitants of several trucks are all dead or dying and there is a satchel of money from what looks like a drug deal gone bad.  Llewelin grabs the money and runs and the rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between him and Javia Bardem, cast as Anton Chiguh, the personification of evil itself.  Llewelin is way over his head as he matches wits with Chiguh, whose deadly weapon of choice is air gun which is usually used to kill cattle. Tommy Lee Jones is cast as the aging and wise sheriff.  He tries to stop the mayhem but is powerless against it.I didn't like the plot.  I want good people to win.  I want a resolution.  I want a tidy ending that I understand.  I don't like leaving the theater and feeling that the conclusion was just a cop out by the author who wrote himself into a hole and, because he couldn't figure out an ending, kills off a lot of people and then decides to let the viewers figure it all out for themselves.  O.K.  I know this is art.  I also know that I can find a book or a film satisfying either in spite of, or sometimes because of, this kind of world view.  But it the case of ""No Country for Old Men"", all I felt was annoyance and depression.I cannot say this was a bad film.  Film buffs will appreciate it.  The directing and acting were impeccable.  And even though the 122 minute-runtime seemed to move at a snail's pace, there wasn't a wasted motion or expression.

Unfortunately, the last few minutes somehow manage to sabatoge the whole film. This is because the movie doesn't have an ending-- what it does have is an abrupt and unexpected shift where the credits suddenly begin rolling. By that point, the betrayal is so deep that first 90 minutes don't matter.Perhaps Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post said it best: ""By narrative convention then, the movie is building toward a confrontation between [two characters]. We know it, we expect it, the rules of the thriller mandate its necessity. It represents the completion of the bargain the storyteller has made with us. 'No Country for Old Men' then vigorously subverts the convention. It's meant to be 'ironic,' with that big capital I. Instead it's unsatisfying, with a capital U.""The whole of the film gives the impression of leading toward an ending that never happens. What we, the viewers, are left with instead is the undramatic death of the one character we liked, the character we wanted to die walking away unscathed, and Tommy Lee Jones ending the film with some pointless piece of jargon.

Llewelyn comes upon a drug deal gone wrong, finding dead mexican drug dealers scattered about in the desert. Unfortunately the mexicans and other parties want the money too. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell played by Tommy Lee Jones arrives at the scene a day later, with his investigation leading to Llewelyn. A very skilled hit man Anton Chigurhn is hired to retrieve the money that Llewelyn stole.Llewelyn has a tough road ahead of him, he makes sure his wife Carla Jean is hiden away from him for her protection. She plays somewhat of a role later in the movie. This movie does well showing Llewelyn going through so much trouble protecting himself and his newfound money. You really feel the tension in many scenes where he has to escape, hide, and battle his way throughout the film.Anton is a hardcore killer, and also nuts. He gets a lot of kiling done, which seems not altogether apart of his job that he was hired for. I don't want to spoil too much though about this characters actions, but their are lot's of suspensful moments in this guy's scenes.Tom Bell the Sheriff is an old fashioned law man, in over his head about the crime trail involved with Lewelyn's assailents. He appears frustrated, and just getting through his job he just seems very tired of it all. Some critics take this as bad acting, instead of just seeing as that's how the character is supposed to be as this Sheriff. It's even explained at the very end how Tom Bell sees this whole crime and how this kind of violence wasn't something he was used to when he was younger. He's in the race to try to save Lewlelyn.This movie goes into a lot of detail about everything, nothing feels rushed.

85189,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,0788882988,"Maine Writer ""David""","[34, 75]","I sat in the theater for about ten minutes after No Country for Old Men was over. It wasn't the genius of it that left me motionless. In fact, I didn't detect very much genius in it at all.  I found none of the characters terribly appealing or engaging, save for the sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones, and he was, at most, an attempted surrogate for the audience--bearing witness to the events of the film and emoting a combination of disbelief, chagrin, and shock.  The story was scattershot and barely engaging.  And what held it all together at all was a murderous character who seemed to be a superficial study in ruthlessness--a man who, in the relentless pursuit of money, gets to indulge a grim kick for gratuitous killing. Everyone knows that there are bloodless, heartless, and fiercely stoic maniacs in the world, and that there always have been.  In fact, in the kind of spoon-feeding I truly hate in movies, Tommy Lee Jones's character recounts a newspaper story about a brutal killing to unnecessarily drive home the point. The only question No Country for Old Men left on the table, at least for me, was, ""So what?""  It's like Terminator told from the point of view of the machines--a heartless, relentless tale with nary a lesson in it apart from the obvious:  Don't mess with drug dealers because you're likely to find a kind of ruthlessness you've never imagined.  Not exactly rocket science, and not exactly unimaginable, since it's been done before in better movies, including The Professional.Part of the reason No Country for Old Men left me cold is that it seemed remarkably undecided as to its own message.  As a result, the critics have had a field day coming up with all manner of metaphors they believe inhabit the story and the characters.  I could find none.  At best, Javier Bardem's killer represented the kind of conscienceless, amoral persona that has become a rather common trigger point for fear and public panic. Not shaded by any empathy or concern for human life, he may be a representation of the modern, existential killing machine who is beyond reasoning with or avoiding--like the carjacker who kills the young mother after she tries to connect with him and provides details of the young children she will leave behind.  He is a predator unmoved, and perhaps even disgusted, by other human beings.  One monumental problem, however, is that No Country For Old Men provides no counterpoint for this. There is not a single character I cared about who came into the crossfire of Bardem's narcissistic psychopath.  In addition, since he mainly focuses his murderous rage on those who, to one degree or another, are culpable in the theft or attempted recovery of drug money, his persona lacks the cold-blooded arbitrariness of so many real killers that make the news.No Country for Old Men, in the end, is the cinematic equivalent of watching a shark feed.  As the movie wrapped up, I thought, maybe the one person spared by our homicidal shadow of a character might kill him in some unintended accident.  At least that would put a nihilistic smile on our faces at the end of this otherwise humorless dirge.",2,Murder Porn,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,3142,"['sat', 'theater', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'was', 'over', 'was', ""n't"", 'genius', 'left', 'motionless', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'detect', 'very', 'much', 'genius', 'found', 'none', 'characters', 'terribly', 'appealing', 'engaging', 'save', 'sheriff', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'was', 'most', 'attempted', 'surrogate', 'audience', 'bearing', 'witness', 'events', 'film', 'emoting', 'combination', 'disbelief', 'chagrin', 'shock', 'story', 'was', 'scattershot', 'barely', 'engaging', 'what', 'held', 'together', 'was', 'murderous', 'character', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'superficial', 'study', 'ruthlessness', 'man', 'who', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'money', 'indulge', 'grim', 'kick', 'gratuitous', 'killing', 'Everyone', 'are', 'bloodless', 'heartless', 'fiercely', 'stoic', 'maniacs', 'world', 'always', 'have', 'been', 'fact', 'kind', 'spoon-feeding', 'truly', 'hate', 'movies', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'character', 'newspaper', 'story', 'brutal', 'killing', 'unnecessarily', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'only', 'question', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'left', 'table', 'least', 'was', 'So', 'what', 'Terminator', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'machines', 'heartless', 'relentless', 'tale', 'lesson', 'apart', 'obvious', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'drug', 'dealers', ""'re"", 'likely', 'find', 'kind', 'ruthlessness', ""'ve"", 'never', 'imagined', 'Not', 'exactly', 'science', 'not', 'exactly', 'unimaginable', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'movies', 'including', 'Professional.Part', 'reason', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'left', 'cold', 'seemed', 'remarkably', 'undecided', 'own', 'message', 'result', 'critics', 'have', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'coming', 'up', 'manner', 'metaphors', 'believe', 'inhabit', 'story', 'characters', 'could', 'find', 'none', 'best', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'killer', 'represented', 'kind', 'conscienceless', 'amoral', 'persona', 'become', 'rather', 'common', 'trigger', 'point', 'fear', 'public', 'panic', 'Not', 'shaded', 'empathy', 'concern', 'human', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'representation', 'modern', 'existential', 'killing', 'machine', 'who', 'reasoning', 'avoiding', 'carjacker', 'who', 'young', 'mother', 'connect', 'details', 'young', 'children', 'will', 'leave', 'behind', 'predator', 'unmoved', 'perhaps', 'even', 'disgusted', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'One', 'monumental', 'problem', 'however', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'counterpoint', 'not', 'single', 'character', 'cared', 'who', 'came', 'crossfire', 'Bardem', 'narcissistic', 'psychopath', 'addition', 'mainly', 'murderous', 'rage', 'who', 'one', 'degree', 'are', 'culpable', 'theft', 'attempted', 'recovery', 'drug', 'money', 'persona', 'cold-blooded', 'arbitrariness', 'so', 'many', 'real', 'killers', 'make', 'news.No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'end', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'watching', 'shark', 'feed', 'movie', 'wrapped', 'up', 'thought', 'maybe', 'one', 'person', 'spared', 'homicidal', 'shadow', 'character', 'might', 'kill', 'unintended', 'accident', 'least', 'would', 'put', 'nihilistic', 'smile', 'end', 'otherwise', 'humorless', 'dirge']",N/A

There were some things that happen that do seem a bit Hollywoodlike, but this is one movie that is so good, those instances can be overlooked.  Javier Bardem's character is on par with Hannibal Lector for nasty creepiness, and his killing sprees are comic book super-villianlike, in addition to the fact that he amazingly never draws attention of any sort throut (except for his last scene, oddly enough ) that aside, Bardems performance was amazing. I can't remember a villian SINCE Lector that was so effortessly creepy and subversive. One of the great cinematic villians, imo.That said, the puzzling thing to me, was the  film title seems oddly inadequate because Bardems character and performance so dominated the movie. After watching, you'll remember this guy way more than Tommy Lee Jones character and situation. In fact, the last scene nearly felt like the Coens thought, 'hey, we better wrap this up with something poignent and reflective of our movie title!, so they gave Jone his infamous monologue at the end. Otoh! ,....you could also argue that it is just another in the long line of elements in this Coen movie that aren't clearly defined...you sorta are left to make up your own mind what kinda movie you're watching. Indeed, the sleight of hand characterwise, would almost have you believing Josh Brolin's character was the focus.Ultimately though, some movies just have that combination of ingredients that make them so compelling to watch, you forget about questioning this or that or trying to pigeonhole what exactly your watching. The stark, absolutely no music background thruout the whole movie, the expansive cinematography, the richness of the unspoken implications of what is going thru each characters mind(how'd they pull that off? lol) , the incredible realness of the west Texas bit characters , Bardems ironic fate.

85194,AIFNOZKR9WTYI,0788882988,"mark twain ""25354""","[11, 30]","I tried to watch the recent Coen brothers movie No Country For Old Men last night.  Real crud.  Its based on the novel of the same name by an ultra-pretentious and hyper-established hack named Cormac McCarthy.  The story telling (in both the book and movie, I'd imagine) is completely unrealistic.  Here's an example of crummy dialog.  Trailer trash protagonist to wife as he is heading out the door to do something dangerous: ""If'n Ahh don't cum back, say hello to Muther fer me.""  ""But LouEllin, Yer Muther is dade!""  (considers a moment) ""Well, then Ahh reckin Ahhl tell'r muhself.""The movie is psychologically completely unrealistic.  For example, toward the end, the ""Sheriff"" (who does absolutely nothing and seems to have no interest in actually apprehending anyone or doing more than read the paper and occasionally offer a bit of folk wisdom), played by Tommy Lee ""Folksy"" Jones, ruminates about some dreams he had to his long-suffering wife.  ""Ahh had me some dreams lass naght.""  ""Anythang innnarestin'?""  ""They alwuz iaz to the party concerned.""Now, this is false.  Dreams are a digestive product directly analogous to feces.  I have written down my own dreams for more than ten years and can report that frequently I have to force myself to write down a dream, forcibly overcoming an aversion to revisiting it, not because it was unpleasant but simply because the most frequent first impression of most remembered dreams is that the dream is too worthless to recount.  But none of this matters in the mind of Cormac McCarthy or the Coen brothers.  They are not interested in reality, only gimcrack everyman profundities that fall apart the moment they are looked at steadily.  McCarthy is a man who likes the sound of his own supposed eloquence.  He is imbued with the notion that just because a sentence comes out of him, it's got to be good.  This is what makes for bad, fraudulent writing.  Hemingway was exactly the same.  And so you have stylized gibberish like when Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Any real need for that ungainly middle name, Cormac?  Usually down south the first and middle names are carefully chosen so that the nicknames can be run together, like Robert Joseph becoming Bobby-Jo.) says of himself and his deceased father, ""We wuz sheriffs at the same tahm.  Ahh think he's proud of that.  Ahh know Ahh wuz.""  Why the mixing of tenses, other than a knee-jerk narcissistic urge toward pretentious bilge?  I mean, why is Sheriff Bell's father, who is deceased, STILL proud of this fact, whereas Sheriff Bell himself is, seemingly, NO LONGER proud of this fact.  It's not deep, it's just nonsense.  And, no, this is not The Hunting of the Snark.  I tried to look at the movie from that angle and it doesn't work.The movie is unrealistic in too many ways to enumerate.  However, one example of how crizap No Country For Old Men is, which most people would consider nit-picking, is the following:  LouEllin, the trailer trash protagonist, is hunting deer when he stumbles across the scene of a drug deal gone bad, with dead bodies everywhere, a bunch of kilos of Columbian bam-bam and the inevitable tired stock plot element of the Briefcase Full of A LOT of Dirty Money.  He then decides that some one of this group who shot each other to hell and gone must have survived and walked away from the scene.  So he takes a submachine gun from one of the dead guys and, slinging his own rifle across his back, goes in search of this fugitive.  He finds him some while later and, leaving his rifle behind, he goes to investigate holding the  newly-acquired (Uzi-like) submachine gun.  This is completely unrealistic.  No person familiar with guns would, in a bad situation, exchange his own rifle for a weapon he is completely unfamiliar with and which he has never test fired or even inspected to be sure it is not jammed.  The movie is full of stuff like this.  I believe it won Best Picture.  This is what the world is, halfwits making entertainment for halfwits who then praise the other halfwits to the skies.Another key plot device of No Country For Old Men is that the Bad Guy, a killer who dresses all in black, originally enough, goes around with a cattle gun, which is an air powered device that shoots and then retracts a bolt, used to stun cattle.  This cattle gun derives its compressed air from a large metal oxygen tank that he lugs around, not to breathe out of but merely to power the cattle gun.  He uses this cattle gun to kill people and also, many times, to knock the cylinder clean out of door locks.  The scene is, the cattle gun busts the lock cylinder right out of the door and it goes shooting across the room.  As I say, this happens many, many times.So this morning I'd had enough of this nonsense and I called a locksmith to ask his opinion.  The guy I talked to had actually seen the movie and so he knew exactly what I was talking about.  He said that it was completely unrealistic and that he laughed when he saw it.  However, this preposterousness did not cause him to stop taking the movie seriously, strangely enough.  Seemingly people do not go to see movies expecting any degree of realism of any kind, be it physical, mechanical, psychological, what have you.  In short, a people get the movies it deserve.",1,No Movie For Sensible People,1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,5261,"['tried', 'watch', 'recent', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'movie', 'No', 'Country', 'Old',

I find that sometimes saving the movie and not knowing all the details allows you to really enjoy the movie instead of waiting for something new to expect.Onto the movie, first of all let me say, Javier Bardem, definitly worthy of his best supporting actor oscar, he was incredible. Second of all, let me also say that Josh Brolin was incredible.The movie is a game of cat and mouse, starting with Josh Brolin in the beginning out trying to hunt. As he is unsuccessful, he stumbles upon what appears to be a drug deal gone wrong. He takes the cash and goes home. Something tells him to go back to the scene as there was one survivor whom he believes can help him solve the puzzle and perhaps predict his fate if he does in fact keep the cash. When he goes back, however, there are already people there, hunting him, looking for what he has stolen.Enter Javier Bardem in what I assume will make me fear him in every future film from here forward, everytime I saw him I was scared to see what would happen next. While it is a longer movie, it is also very enjoyable and therefore you don't realize just how long the movie is.

85197,A1Z6AXXBRHP4A9,0788882988,Matthew J. Uhley,"[1, 1]","Joel & Ethan Coen's latest is easily an improvement on their sorrier, more recent offerings (Intolerable Cruelty, Ladykillers). But it's harder for me to tell you if it's the brothers' strongest since their magnum opus, The Big Lebowski (I at least half-liked O Brother, Where Art Thou? & The Man Who Wasn't There).No Country For Old Men comes up short for me in one crucial area: its third act. This is one of those movies that doesn't really have a climax and yet putters along anyway for quite awhile before finally exiting stage right. The wind-up is unsatisfying and seems like it's married to the source novel too close for comfort (though I haven't read the book to be sure).The dialogue remains tight and clever throughout but I didn't feel like the movie really delivered any kind of payoff. It's fine for a film to gloss over what would normally be the logical endpoint of its story and search for a higher meaning, but I didn't feel the Coens achieved this. A rewrite of the ending would have elevated the whole film to another level, because the rising momentum of its tension was strong and well-earned from the beginning. This is a composition that's quiet (almost no background music whatsoever) and still. Characters talk only when they need to. The excellent Roger Deakins cinematography is draped in shadows, looking natural yet striking. There's no special f/x sleight of hand or plot twist trickery to distract you from the meat and potatoes script. Like the Bourne spy yarns, you're shown all the steps a character takes to pull off an escape, retrieve a briefcase under siege, or blow up a car without explosives.Until the last 20 minutes or so you're not left with any lingering questions and there aren't any plotholes to speak of. It's not a weak, messy finale so much as it feels deflated and almost dull compared to what came before. Thrillers like this one are most memorable when they save the best for last.Tommy Lee Jones is actually the star of this, not Josh Brolin (who still gave a captivating performance despite getting shortchanged near the end). Tommy Lee is a towering actor as usual and Javier Bardem hits all the right creepy notes as the existentialist killer hunting down Brolin (he manages to be a real world version of Two-Face in his coin toss scenes).This is definitely one of the better movies of the last few years but not good enough to win my vote for 2007's best. I'd recommend seeing it eventually but unless you can figure out a better explanation for the end than I could come up with, you also might think it falls short of greatness.",4,Use rawhide to keep your teeth grinding in check from all the suspense,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,2591,"['Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'latest', 'easily', 'improvement', 'sorrier', 'more', 'recent', 'offerings', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'Ladykillers', 'harder', 'tell', 'brothers', 'strongest', 'magnum', 'opus', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'least', 'half-liked', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", '.No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'up', 'short', 'one', 'crucial', 'area', 'third', 'act', 'one', 'movies', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'climax', 'yet', 'putters', 'anyway', 'quite', 'awhile', 'finally', 'exiting', 'stage', 'right', 'wind-up', 'unsatisfying', 'married', 'source', 'novel', 'too', 'close', 'comfort', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'be', 'sure', '.The', 'dialogue', 'tight', 'clever', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'really', 'delivered', 'kind', 'payoff', 'fine', 'film', 'gloss', 'over', 'what', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'logical', 'endpoint', 'story', 'search', 'higher', 'meaning', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Coens', 'achieved', 'rewrite', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'elevated', 'whole', 'film', 'level', 'rising', 'momentum', 'tension', 'was', 'strong', 'well-earned', 'beginning', 'composition', 'quiet', 'almost', 'background', 'music', 'whatsoever', 'still', 'Characters', 'talk', 'only', 'when', 'need', 'excellent', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'cinematography', 'draped', 'shadows', 'looking', 'natural', 'yet', 'striking', 'special', 'f/x', 'sleight', 'hand', 'plot', 'twist', 'trickery', 'distract', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'script', 'Bourne', 'spy', 'yarns', ""'re"", 'shown', 'steps', 'character', 'pull', 'off', 'escape', 'retrieve', 'briefcase', 'siege', 'blow', 'up', 'car', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', ""'re"", 'not', 'left', 'lingering', 'questions', 'are', ""n't"", 'plotholes', 'speak', 'not', 'weak', 'messy', 'finale', 'so', 'much', 'deflated', 'almost', 'dull', 'compared', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'Thrillers', 'one', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'when', 'save', 'best', 'last.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'actually', 'star', 'not', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'still', 'gave', 'captivating', 'performance', 'getting', 'shortchanged', 'end', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'towering', 'actor', 'usual', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'right', 'creepy', 'notes', 'existentialist', 'killer', 'hunting', 'down', 'Brolin', 'be', 'real', 'world', 'version', 'Two-Face', 'coin', 'scenes', '.This', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'win', 'vote', '2007', 'best', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'seeing', 'eventually', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'better', 'explanation', 'end', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'also', 'might', 'think', 'short', 'greatness']",N/A

85203,A1AYN3IIUNQCIA,0788882988,"Melanie Edwards ""book worm""","[8, 16]","Warning: Minor SpoliersFor the past three years or so, I have been pretty oppossed to the Academy Awards and their Best Picture winners (the last of which I truley accepted being The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King). Million Dollar Baby was a nice movie, but it didn't stick with me in the long run. Crash was a very mediocre film that only got lucky because of its LA fan base and conservative members (Brokeback Mountain was by far superior and should have won), The Departed was pretty good but not one of my favorites of the whole year, and now, this years winner, No Country for Old Men, has won the award and so naturally, I had to see it. I've obviously heard about the raves this film has been getting, most everyone calling it a masterpiece, saying it was the best film in a long time and picked up almost every single major Best Picture awards. I figured, there must be something about the film thats so great.The film intwertwins three diffrent story lines that all seem to center around a drug deal gone bad. Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon the massacer and along with the huge pile of drugs, finds a suitcase full of money. So naturally, he takes it. Unfortunatly for him, he has just stumbled into a dangerous situation and is now being hunted down by a hired gun name Anton Chigurh, while a local sherrif is right behind them as he tries to piece together the whole crime.For the positives, I definently agree that all the acting was pretty good, Javier Bardem just morphing into a great villian. With steely eyes, cold determination, he's like a walking Reaper, armed with his pressurized gun and killing almost everyone unfortunate to cross his path. Tommy Lee Jones makes the most of his small role while Josh Brolin took me by surprise with his pretty restrained performence and Kelly MacDonald also surprising me with her nice gem of a role. Even Beth Grant does wonders in her role that literally only last for over a minute. So, bravo to the actors.However, and this is the big however, my one big problem with this movie is this. When its all said and done, the film was really just a whole bunch of nothing. Sure, we know there's a drug deal and money and a killer and all that stuff and there was a pretty thrilling scene during the middle but its almost as if the film just obidently trudges on through the film, having its characters do all this stuff and say all these things, and by the end, what does it all add up to? Is it a film about free will? or the after match of violence? is the whole thing about violence? changing times? what was this whole movie about?Now, to put it out, I have never really been a Coen Brothers fan. I just don't get any of there movies. Maybe i'm just the odd one out but I honestly don't see anything when I watch there films. Blood Simple, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, all of those films I just found either very average, completly upsurd, or just plain weird. So even before I was going to view this movie, I already had an idea that this may not live up to all the hype its getting.Another problem I have is with the ending. Now, I don't mind open ended movies. Hell, I think that a film can be superb with an open end. But for me, when the whole thing ended, I really just thought it was almost like a complete waste of my time. Again, the whole ending added up to nothing. I ask you, what was the whole point in the sherrif's ending speech? what significance did it have with the whole of the film? why are we shown Chigurh getting hit by some car at the end? is there something there that I'm not getting? and the whole thing with the sherrif and his uncle, again, what was the whole point of that scene? are we suppose to take notice and say 'yeah, violence, its always going to be there and stuff'. And as for Woody Harrelson, can someone tell me the whole purpose of his role? I mean, did he really had anything to the story? at all?. Basically, in general, were those last 30 minutes or so ABOSULTLY nessesary?I really just think this film is a critics film. Something that all the professionals rave about and absolutly adore and love. But for the general public, it dosen't always translate like that. For people like me, its just a jumble of events that lead to a pretty vacant (and slightly pointless) ending. For others, its a masterpiece of a film and the critics are right to cheer and its one of those films that has to be seen. And for some, they just won't get it at all and leave the theater (or television room) scratching there heads in frustration.In short, No Country for Old Men can arguably be added up to a film about a lot of nothing. For me, a film (no matter how great or bad) has some sort of meaning to its making, some sort of theme that drives it along. But as the credits begin to role and your sitting in your seat wonder 'so what exactly was that all about?', it just seems sort of like a waste of time. For the critics and all those who love this film, thats good for you and obviously you all see something that I'm not seeing. Cause all I see is a film of pointless violence, pointless talk, pointless scenes, and basically a handful of pretty 'decent' moments and great acting, all of which add up to...nothing.I guess I'll have to see what next years Best Picture winner has to offer.

It isn't the Coen Brothers' best work, and I certainly don't think it deserved to beat out films like ""Atonement"" and ""Michael Clayton"" for the Academy Award for Best Picture.This movie, which is based on a Cormac McCarthy novel, is a modern-day western involving a Vietnam vet, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who finds a case containing $2 million in the desert...surrounded by a bunch of dead bodies. Llewelyn opts to take the money and run, but unfortunately for him, a big, burly guy toting a cattle gun (Javier Bardem) is hot on his tail. The whole film basically revolves around this chase, with Llewelyn generally being one step ahead until the very end.I though the movie was interesting, and was especially impressed by Bardem's eerily calm performance. The film boasts a strong supporting cast, including Tommy Lee Jones and Kelly Macdonald, but none of them were brilliant enough to save this movie for me. The entire film is very slow-paced, and the ending is incredibly abrupt and thoroughly unsatisfying.

85205,A1U360OMVQRPUB,0788882988,Mel Odom,"[11, 17]","Spanish actor, Javier Bardem, plays one of the most cold-blooded, unstoppable killers to ever grace the big screen.  From the very first instant he steps into view in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN as Anton Chigurh, Bardem radiates menace.  The captive bolt pistol he carries as a killing device and a one-size-fits-all door opener is grisly and awe-inspiring.  When he's initially introduced at the beginning of the film, gets arrested, then steps back through the handcuffs in the background while the deputy speaks to the sheriff in the foreground, a cold chill cycled through me until Chigurh killed the deputy.  By that time I was mesmerized.The Academy-award winning film is based on bestselling author Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name.  Joel and Ethan Coen (FARGO, MILLER'S CROSSING) wrote and directed the film, returning to the crime and cowboy feel they love in so much of their work.The plot is relatively simple, but it provides a tightly-wound backdrop of tension and motivation for all concerned.  Josh Brolin is absolutely amazing as ex-Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss, and most of the screen time the first half of the movie centers on him.  The movie is so terse that I had no idea who or what Brolin was or what he was ultimately after for quite some time.I loved the careful, contained way that Moss walks up on the killing ground where the two rival Mexican gangs shot it out and killed each other during a drug buy.  Brolin portrays a competent and savvy hunter, and I was rooting for him the whole way - until I found out he wasn't as good as I thought he was.  Even then, I'd bought so heavily into the character that I was pulling for him the whole way.  Especially after I saw that he was clearly out of his league.The movie delves into character without playing up the backstory too much.  It tells you just what you need to know about each person, and I found that amazing.  The dialogue is kept terse and to the point, while at the same time being witty and true to character and life.  Most of the time you're just watching action, forming your own opinions about things, and being surprised.  There isn't even a musical score to draw your attention off the developing plot and ever-tightening chase.With Chigurh and Moss both in motion, both trying to survive, the movie picks up with Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) as he borrows his wife's horse to go out to the crime scene.  I loved Tommy Lee Jones.  I think he's one of the greatest actors to ever step into a movie, and he's at his absolute best when he's playing a character like Ed Tom Bell.  Those characters are some of the best natural fits for Jones that I've ever seen.  Bell is a man nearing retirement, but who's also certain that the world is changing faster than he can keep up with it.  Jones provides the voice-over at the beginning that won my heart before the last word floated out of the speakers.Moss, with over two million dollars in his hands, is determined to hang onto it.  Chigurh is determined to kill Moss and take it.  Bell just wants to make sense of everything that's happened and save whomever needs saving.The Coens are noted for their camera work and angles, and both things are used to the best of their abilities in this film.  The scenes move quickly.  The background is absolutely stunning in the high definition presentation of the Blu-ray disc.  The gunfights are exquisitely rendered, and violence smacks the viewer at regular intervals, often catching him off-guard.Even though I was prepared for the film to be bloody, I was still blown away by Chigurh's cold indifference.  I loved how the killer moved so methodically, though, never showing any emotions.  This is probably Brolin's best role and best acting ever.  Even though these actors are playing larger-than-life characters, never once is a scene overplayed, nor is the drama ever false.If you haven't seen NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, you've got a great film ahead of you.  And if you have seen it, you'll find that the Blu-ray version brings the audio and video quality of the theater into your home in a big way.

Lots of dead bodies, lots of vehicles full of shotgun holes, and a briefcase with a couple million dollars in it. He should have walked away and called the police, but he gets stupid and grabs the money, thereby becoming the target of psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh, played with evil intensity by Javier Bardem. Moss is on the run, Sheriff Bell (played perfectly by Tommy Lee Jones) is trying to find him before Chigurh does, and the bodies accumulate. Woody Harrelson is competent as Carson Wells, hired to find the money by the drug people, and Kelly Macdonald, who doesn't get enough screen time, nails the role of Moss's young wife. I know West Texas, and the cinematography is extremely evocative, especially in the early scenes. The accents are perfect -- even Macdonald's, and she's a Scot.

85215,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,0788882988,"Michelle L. Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[0, 2]","I will first say that when I started watching this movie it was really late at night, and I fell asleep with only about 30 minutes to go. But the next morning, I woke up and watched it again and realized that I must have just been tired because it was a decent movie. I like the old look of the film, and I liked the fact that the movie did not depend on a lot of special effects but instead counted on vivid imagery to tell a decent story.Llewelyn, an VietnamVet, happens upon a bloody ""drug deal gone bad"", where everyone is dead (with the exception of a man who is on the verge) and $2 million dollars is just sitting there (in a suitcase) for the taking. What does Llewelyn do? He ignores a dying man (who is begging for water), takes the money and goes home to count his good fortune (why he didn't think the real owners of the money would come looking, I will never know). What does he do next? He feels guilty and goes back to the scene to give water to the dying man (which isn't so smart because if he does live, wouldn't he want the money back?). He was waging the internal war between his greed and his guilty conscious. Now initially, I thought that this was the cause of the chain of events that follow, but I soon realized is that the money would have been located by the Killer regardless. It had GPS! That's right boys and girls, the crazy killer (Chigurh, who has a thing for making you choose your fate...he asks you to pick heads or tails) would have found him anyway because he was following the money.Sending his sweet wife to her mother (who is crazy and tells everyone who will listen that she is dying), Llewelyn attempts to outsmart and outrun the killer (and I do mean killer, he kills any and everything with a cool gun) and keep the money. After several deaths, and a lot of maneuvering Llewelyn comes face to face with the killer and several other interesting characters, while a very determined local sheriff attempts to uncover the truth and find him before it is too late.Now don't get me wrong, I do have a few criticisms (although I still gave it 4 stars). #1. I felt a little cheated at the ending. After almost 200 minutes of story, I had an ending that really would have been better if some things had happened differently, but I won't tell you how it ends. I could have just thought of different endings for Llewelyn, Wells, the wife, the cop, and the crazed killer. And therefore, I found the ending to be a little anticlimactic.  And. #2. Maybe I am stupid, but I am still confused about who had the money in the end? And if it is who I think it was, well that is even more disappointing.Now I will say what I did like....I liked each and every character (the good, the bad and the ugly). I loved the conversations that Tommy Lee Jones had with the guy in the wheelchair who put his entire life into perspective, and I thought the mother (Llewelyn's wife's mother) was hilarious. I also thought that the imagery (dry scenes, Texas) and the language (Southern drawls) were extremely appropriate.Anyway, with all that said, I really thought that the movie had more positives than negatives. And I believe that the average movie watcher, if they aren't expecting a lot of special effects, but want instead to see a crazy killer (with a bob), who mutters few words, and appears to be smarter than the average person, will enjoy this movie.",4,You'll either like it or you won't!,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,3375,"['will', 'first', 'say', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'late', 'night', 'fell', 'asleep', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'go', 'next', 'morning', 'woke', 'up', 'watched', 'again', 'realized', 'must', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'tired', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'like', 'old', 'look', 'film', 'liked', 'fact', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'depend', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'instead', 'counted', 'vivid', 'imagery', 'tell', 'decent', 'story.Llewelyn', 'VietnamVet', 'bloody', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', 'where', 'everyone', 'dead', 'exception', 'man', 'who', 'verge', '2', 'million', 'dollars', 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'suitcase', 'taking', 'What', 'Llewelyn', 'do', 'dying', 'man', 'who', 'begging', 'water', 'money', 'home', 'count', 'good', 'fortune', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'real', 'owners', 'money', 'would', 'come', 'looking', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'What', 'do', 'next', 'guilty', 'back', 'scene', 'give', 'water', 'dying', 'man', ""n't"", 'so', 'smart', 'live', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'money', 'back', 'was', 'waging', 'internal', 'war', 'greed', 'guilty', 'conscious', 'Now', 'initially', 'thought', 'was', 'cause', 'chain', 'events', 'follow', 'soon', 'realized', 'money', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'located', 'Killer', 'regardless', 'had', 'GPS', 'right', 'boys', 'girls', 'crazy', 'killer', 'Chigurh', 'who', 'thing', 'making', 'choose', 'fate', 'pick', 'heads', 'tails', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'anyway', 'was', 'following', 'money.Sending', 'sweet', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'crazy', 'everyone', 'who', 'will', 'listen', 'dying', 'Llewelyn', 'outsmart', 'outrun', 'killer', 'do', 'mean', 'killer', 'everything', 'cool', 'gun', 'keep', 'money', 'several', 'deaths', 'lot', 'maneuvering', 'Llewelyn', 'face', 'face', 'killer', 'several', 'other', 'interesting', 'characters', 'very', 'determined', 'local', 'sheriff', 'attempts', 'uncover', 'truth', 'find', 'too', 'late.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'criticisms', 'still', 'gave', '4', 'stars', '1', 'felt', 'little', 'cheated', 'ending', 'almost', '200', 'minutes', 'story', 'had', 'ending', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'things', 'had', 'happened', 'differently', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'thought', 'different', 'endings', 'Llewelyn', 'Wells', 'wife', 'cop', 'crazed', 'killer', 'therefore', 'found', 'ending', 'be', 'little', 'anticlimactic', '2', 'Maybe', 'am', 'stupid', 'am', 'still', 'confused', 'who', 'had', 'money', 'end', 'who', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'even', 'more', 'disappointing.Now', 'will', 'say', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'liked', 'character', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'loved', 'conversations', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'had', 'guy', 'wheelchair', 'who', 'put', 'entire', 'life', 'perspective', 'thought', 'mother', 'Llewelyn', 'wife', 'mother', 'was', 'hilarious', 'also', 'thought', 'imagery', 'dry', 'scenes', 'Texas', 'language', 'Southern', 'drawls', 'were', 'extremely', 'appropriate.Anyway', 'said', 'really', 'thought', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'positives', 'negatives', 'believe', 'average', 'movie', 'watcher', 'are', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'want', 'instead', 'see', 'crazy', 'killer', 'bob', 'who', 'few', 'words', 'be', 'smarter', 'average', 'person', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A

There he finds a collection of bodies, bundles of cocaine, and two million dollars in cash.  He takes the cash, but is exposed by rival gang members after bringing an injured man at the scene water.  He takes the money and sends his wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) into hiding.  However, while the Mexican gangs are trying to track down the cash, Llewelyn is also being chased by the sociopathic hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who will stop at nothing or let anyone get in the way of him getting his revenge, if even for being inconvenienced.  All the while, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is following a trail of blood and is doing his best to protect Llewelyn from getting killed.  Will Llewelyn survive with the money or will he die trying?Now, I can understand how people would be turned off by the violence of the film.  However, for anyone to say this is a bad movie has to have a prejudice to let the violence overtake the excellent direction, cinematography, and acting that was prevalent through the film.  While Brolin and Jones were good, Bardem's portrayal of the sociopathic Chigurh was beyond excellent and was absolutely deserving the Academy Award he earned.  Also, the Cohen Brothers version of the screenplay was as intense as it goes.  I can't remember watching a film that made me feel the intensity the way that this one has, and for that, I have to give it high accolades.This is one of the better movies that have been released in sometime.

85217,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,0788882988,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","As my title suggests, there is not a lot of middle ground with this movie.  It seems most people either really like it, either because they were a fan of the book, the Cohen Brothers in general, or just saw the movie because they heard someone say it was good and ended up liking it.  On the other hand the people who hate it seem to be in the camp of it is too slow, there is no real conclusion and there is not much point to it.At the core it is a chase movie.  Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the scene of a drug deal gone wrong while out hunting.  He finds 2 million dollars and takes the money, thinking right place right time.  In a very stupid move he goes back to bring water to one of the men left barely alive, but ends up being spotted.  That sets up the rest of the movie.  He ends up being pursued by killer Anton Chigurh (played wonderfully by Javier Bardem), who is a killer with some sense of a code, but will also kill anyone who gets in his way.  The cornerstone of the movie is the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones)  who is trying to make sense of the entire thing and stop Chigurh, a killer he does not understand, and save Moss.The movie leaves a lot of the filling in the blanks to the viewer.  It is a very violent movie that has a lot of suspense and action.  You do not however learn all the pieces of the puzzle and are left to guess at the fate of some of the characters.  So if you are a person that needs for the entire movie to be wrapped up in a nice bow at the end and everything resolved, you will hate this movie.  The point of the movie, to the extent there is one was to show how crime had changed for Sheriff Bell, and how he felt that he could not comprehend and keep up with the &#34;new&#34; criminal element.What made the movie great to me was the acting and writing.  The cast is truly ensemble, with Tommy Lee Jones being the most well known at the time.  Everyone from the main characters to those who basically just made cameo appearances like Woody Harrelson and Stephen Root, did a great job.  Even though the story was essentially being told from Sheriff Bell's point of view (at least in terms of the narrations throughout the film) it did not focus on one character above the rest.  It was also unique in that none of the main characters every really interacted.  The closest was a shootout between Moss and Chigurh where neither one got a real good look at each other.As far as the disc itself goes (because Amazon lumps all the reviews together I have th single disc blu ray), the A/V quality is great.  The cinematography  of the movie was excellent, and the shots really jumped out in the blu ray presentation.  As far as extras on the single disc edition go, there is about 40 min or so of making of and behind the scenes features.  The centerpiece being a 25 min &#34;Making of No Country for Old Men&#34; feature.Chances are most people will have already seen the movie or at least heard about it.  Like I said, it is definitely not for everyone, and has kind of an offbeat nature like the Cohen Brothers are known for.  I am not in the camp of people who calls it the greatest movie of all time, but for a movie that is a blend of drama, suspense and very dark comedy, it is worth checking out.  Just know however that if you do, it does not end with everything being answered and does leave you to think and draw your own conclusions.",5,This is a movie you will either love or hate,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,3401,"['title', 'not', 'lot', 'middle', 'ground', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'really', 'either', 'were', 'fan', 'book', 'Cohen', 'Brothers', 'general', 'just', 'saw', 'movie', 'heard', 'someone', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'other', 'hand', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'be', 'camp', 'too', 'slow', 'real', 'conclusion', 'not', 'much', 'point', 'it.At', 'core', 'chase', 'movie', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'scene', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'out', 'hunting', '2', 'million', 'dollars', 'money', 'thinking', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'very', 'stupid', 'move', 'back', 'bring', 'water', 'one', 'men', 'left', 'barely', 'alive', 'up', 'being', 'spotted', 'up', 'rest', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'pursued', 'killer', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'killer', 'sense', 'code', 'will', 'also', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'cornerstone', 'movie', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'entire', 'thing', 'stop', 'Chigurh', 'killer', 'not', 'understand', 'save', 'Moss.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'filling', 'blanks', 'viewer', 'very', 'violent', 'movie', 'lot', 'suspense', 'action', 'do', 'not', 'however', 'learn', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'are', 'left', 'guess', 'fate', 'characters', 'So', 'are', 'person', 'entire', 'movie', 'be', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nice', 'bow', 'end', 'everything', 'resolved', 'will', 'hate', 'movie', 'point', 'movie', 'extent', 'one', 'was', 'show', 'how', 'crime', 'had', 'changed', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'how', 'felt', 'could', 'not', 'comprehend', 'keep', 'up', '34', 'new', '34', 'criminal', 'made', 'movie', 'great', 'was', 'acting', 'writing', 'cast', 'truly', 'ensemble', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'being', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'time', 'Everyone', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'basically', 'just', 'made', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Even', 'story', 'was', 'essentially', 'being', 'told', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'point', 'view', 'least', 'terms', 'narrations', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'focus', 'one', 'character', 'rest', 'was', 'also', 'unique', 'none', 'main', 'characters', 'really', 'interacted', 'closest', 'was', 'shootout', 'Moss', 'Chigurh', 'where', 'one', 'got', 'real', 'good', 'look', 'other.As', 'far', 'disc', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'together', 'have', 'th', 'single', 'disc', 'blu', 'ray', 'A/V', 'quality', 'great', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'shots', 'really', 'jumped', 'out', 'blu', 'ray', 'presentation', 'As', 'far', 'extras', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'go', '40', 'min', 'so', 'making', 'scenes', 'features', 'centerpiece', 'being', '25', 'min', '34', 'Making', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', '34', 'feature.Chances', 'are', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'least', 'heard', 'said', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'kind', 'offbeat', 'nature', 'Cohen', 'Brothers', 'are', 'known', 'am', 'not', 'camp', 'people', 'who', 'greatest', 'movie', 'time', 'movie', 'blend', 'drama', 'suspense', 'very', 'dark', 'comedy', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'Just', 'know', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'everything', 'being', 'answered', 'leave', 'think', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions']",N/A

Moore,"[7, 14]","Everybody who is looking at this product page already knows the basic plot of ""No Country for Old Men,"" so I will not waste time recounting it here. So many of the reviews take the Coen Brothers to task for not resolving the plot at the end. I beg to differ; there IS a resolution to the plot of ""No Country for Old Men."" The resolution is simply so bleak and dour--cutting us off totally from the traditional pleasures of crime dramas, Westerns and even film noir--that viewers just don't want to believe it. I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's original novel, but everything I've read about the film leads me to believe it is extremely faithful to the source. McCarthy, for those unfamiliar with his work, is a novelist whose views of life and fate make Thomas Hardy look like A.A. Milne. It isn't surprising, then, that the makers of ""Blood Simple"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" would find McCarthy's work so congenial, and be able to do justice to his unsparing vision while other filmmakers (Billy Bob Thornton's version of ""All the Pretty Horses"" comes to mind) flinch from it. ""No Country for Old Men"" is the Coen Brothers' best film since ""Fargo"" (though even ""Fargo"" is a Disneyfied cheerfest compared with ""No Country for Old Men""; if Cormac McCarthy had written ""Fargo,"" Marge Gunderson and her unborn child would have been residual casualties, and Gunsrud would still be wandering the prairies looking for a ""pancakes house""). ""No Country for Old Men"" is a movie I greatly admire and respect, though--unlike ""Fargo""--it's not a movie I envision watching over and over again. But the Coen Brothers certainly blast the film's memory into your brain, as surely as Anton Chigurh's cattle gun. The film's screenplay (by the Coens, of course) and cinematography (vast echoing expanses of desert and mountain, captured brilliantly by the great Roger Deakins) are perfect in every way. So are the lead performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, each earning a one-way ticket to Brandoville, the capital of Olivier Land. The supporting performances of Woody Harrelson, Kelly Jean Macdonald, Barry Corbin, Tess Harper, Beth Grant, Gene Jones, Stephen Root and others are of equal (that is to say, surpassing) excellence. ""No Country for Old Men"" is unquestionably a great movie.

85219,A258N5V9ATX38H,0788882988,"Milka ""cat happy""","[11, 15]","I don't love this movie, but I don't hate it either. I came away fromit kind of puzzled and was grateful for some of the reviews posted,as they clarified quite a few oversights and misunderstandings I hadabout the film when I watched it.The film is somewhat violent, but in no way did I find the killinggratuitous or out of context. To me, gratuitous violence is the gory,blood-drenched, voyeuristic killing you see in slasher and snuff films.As for the movie's plot, I thought the story was straightforward enoughand has been summarized here adequately by other reviewers. I did notread the book the film was based on, so can't answer to how true thefilm stayed to its origins. What I found most complex about the film wasits characters, and of course, the film's hotly contested ending.It seems Americans, for the most part, like seeing movies that are easy todigest and have tidy endings. You're not going to get either of these whenyou watch this film. Of the Coen movies, I'm guessing the reason Fargoreceived such a positive response (I personally love the film) was due to,among other things, the presence of characters with well-defined moralboundaries and a ""justice served"" type of ending.In ""No Country For Old Men,"" the world view of the characters and the moralcodes they abide by are not simple to define. In Llewelyn Moss, you have aman stupid enough to steal drug money, compassionate enough to take a drugrunner a jug of water, loyal enough to tell a pool-side prostitute he's married,and power-hungry enough to sell his wife out to the assassin on his trail. Bythe end of the movie, it's not even about the money for him anymore. He'sseduced by the chase, which ends in tragic consequences. For all intents, Ithought Javier Bardem does an excellent job as the sociopathic killer---accent,bowl hair cut, and all. The fact that Anton Chigurh lives by his own twisted""code"" when it comes to his victims makes his character all the more chilling andintense. The most complex character by far, however, is the sheriff played byTommy Lee Jones. A man trapped in the past glory days of law enforcement whencapturing bad guys was a lot simpler, Sheriff Bell cannot wrap his tired, old brainaround the likes of criminals like Anton Chigurh. For me, his apathy and denial(he queries at one point if Anton Chigurh is real or just a ghost) signals one of thefilm's subtler moral dilemmas. One of the most powerful scenes in the film---andone I can't quite make sense of---is when Bell enters the last crime scene andChigurh is hiding behind the door. That scene sums up the moral ambiguity that theCoens seem to be going for. What's worse? Monsters at large or the society unable toharness them, for whatever reason? For me, the end of the film helps to answer thisvery question.Overall, I found it to be a very thought-provoking piece.

85220,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,0788882988,mirasreviews,"[4, 5]","""No Country for Old Men"" is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, which I have not read. It falls nicely into the oeuvre of darkly comic, intermittently gruesome crime films directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, though there is less plot than we usually get from the brothers Coen. In the parched border country of West Texas, 1980, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, including a satchel full of money. He packs his wife off to her mother's and prepares to defend himself against whomever lays claim to the loot. That would be obsessive killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), whose trail of carnage has put Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) on his tail.The three main characters never meet, which contributes to the film's somewhat excessive length, as we must view them in separate scenes. Llewelyn, a working class Everyman who jumps at the chance for financial freedom, is pursued obsessively by Chigurh, with veteran lawman Bell bringing up the rear, bewildered by the nature of crime he sees nowadays. Chigurh is less a character than a force of nature. His actions seem to have no motivation. He represents all the bad stuff that bubbles to the surface when something in society goes  out of kilter -in this case a surge in the drug trade along the Mexican border in the early 1980s.This is one of the simplest plots I've ever seen filmed: An Everyman, Evil Incarnate, and a Good Guy, chasing one another, like ducks in a row. Perhaps it's too simple for a film of two hours. Tommy Lee Jones' earnest, deadpan delivery, and Chigurh's odd insistence on blaming fate for his actions helped keep my attention. But, apart from an allegory on violence that is so broad as to be meaningless, this is a chase movie that moves at a snail's pace. I was disappointed by the lack of complexity, but ""No Country for Old Men"" reminds me of  1990's ""Miller's Crossing"". Both films are violent, entertaining exercises in style, not substance, though this one is both funnier and more violent.The DVD (Miramax 2008): There are 3 bonus featurettes. ""The Making of No Country for Old Men"" (23 min) interviews the Coens about their attraction to the material and adapting the book, the cast about their roles, executive producer Robert Graf, and some creative and technical crew about recreating the 1980s.  In ""Working with the Coens"" (8 min), the cast and some crew talk about the Coens directing style. In ""Diary of a Country Sheriff"" (7 min), The Coens talk about the Bell and Chigurh characters.

Set against the barren, wind-swept desert of the west Texas plains, the Coen brothers latest film is an unflinching portrait of men destroying each other for petty gain and the decay of an American society that played a major part in molding their moral outlook.  Tommy Lee Jones, doing some of the most stupendous and subtle work of his career, acts as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell the world-weary narrator to the downward spiral of humanity.  Javier Bardem, to whom an oscar will be most assuredly be gift-wrapped, shuts down any hint of humanity to play Anton Chigurgh, a ghoulish, blood-chilling, drug-running enforcer who races across Texas to hunt down Lleywen Moss (Josh Brolin, so into character he almost becomes transparent), the unlucky cowboy who happened to take the wrong drug money at the wrong time.  The chase between Moss and Chigurgh is exciting enough, what with the Coen brothers pulling out all the stops to let the blood flow and bullets fly.  Try to remember to breathe when the two shoot it out in motel and around the surrounding township.  But it's the brothers sharply written script that digs in its hooks to extrapolate the plight of Moss and Chigurgh to the world at large, how their violent battles may just be systemic of bigger, deeper and more corrosive trends in American society.  ""No Country for Old Men"" is a tough film to watch, and not because of the ample, shocking violence; it's tough to watch because of what the violence means.  It's a triumph for the brothers Coen and one of the best films of the year.",5,"A Stellar, Bleak, Thought-Provoking Film",1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,1600,"['Lean', 'terse', 'storytelling', 'powers', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Set', 'barren', 'wind-swept', 'desert', 'west', 'Texas', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'latest', 'film', 'unflinching', 'portrait', 'men', 'destroying', 'other', 'petty', 'gain', 'decay', 'American', 'society', 'played', 'major', 'part', 'molding', 'moral', 'outlook', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'doing', 'most', 'stupendous', 'subtle', 'work', 'career', 'Sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'world-weary', 'narrator', 'downward', 'spiral', 'humanity', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'whom', 'oscar', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'assuredly', 'be', 'gift-wrapped', 'shuts', 'down', 'hint', 'humanity', 'play', 'Anton', 'Chigurgh', 'ghoulish', 'blood-chilling', 'drug-running', 'enforcer', 'who', 'Texas', 'hunt', 'down', 'Lleywen', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'so', 'character', 'almost', 'transparent', 'unlucky', 'cowboy', 'who', 'happened', 'take', 'wrong', 'drug', 'money', 'wrong', 'time', 'chase', 'Moss', 'Chigurgh', 'exciting', 'enough', 'what', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'pulling', 'out', 'stops', 'let', 'blood', 'flow', 'bullets', 'fly', 'Try', 'remember', 'breathe', 'when', 'two', 'shoot', 'out', 'motel', 'surrounding', 'township', 'brothers', 'sharply', 'written', 'script', 'hooks', 'extrapolate', 'plight', 'Moss', 'Chigurgh', 'world', 'large', 'how', 'violent', 'battles', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'systemic', 'bigger', 'deeper', 'more', 'corrosive', 'trends', 'American', 'society', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'tough', 'film', 'watch', 'not', 'ample', 'shocking', 'violence', 'tough', 'watch', 'what', 'violence', 'triumph', 'brothers', 'Coen', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year']",N/A

85224,A30DQ67B90NDZA,0788882988,"Mnr L. P. Muller ""Louis Muller""","[13, 17]","What bothers  many reviewers about this film is precisely that which sets it apart for me.  It is true that it denies us much of what  we have come to expect from the standard study of morality. We are denied the longed-for show-down between good ( Sherriff Ed Tom Bell) and depravity (Chigurh ), denied the shoot-out (between Llewellen and Chigurh ), denied the retribution of evil in any overt way. This is no country for old cliche's.And yet. We are given hints. Hints that there is a system of justice which operates despite the hopelessness so barrenly expressed by Sherriff Ed Tom Bell. But it operates covertly, irresistibly, to the extent that even the most calculating, self-contained psychopath cannot escape its reach; Chigurh, arrogantly, dismissively leaving the scene of his latest(last?) hit (Carla Jean) is arbitrarily flicked of his perch by two boys innocently goofing around on their cycles. This crucially distracts him  and plunges him headlong into the utter violence of a motor-car collision, grievously injuring him. Like one of his own victims (Llewelyn ), he is reduced to barter for an item of clothing (to make a sling) to make good his escape. His fate is clearly implied.This surely is how we all know the world of morality; We never see justice as we would like it, our sense of vengeance is always somehow left unsatisfied. (Hitler's demise is hidden from our eyes, Stalin dies a venerated figure, Bin Laden, like Jack the Ripper always seems to elude our grasp. And nobody ever seems to put the rude waiter in his place.) But the strength of the film is to suggest, for those who have eyes to see, that vengeance, although not ours, operates on a level so refined and subtle that it always takes us unawares. In this sense the film is realistic in the best, profound sense of the word. It brings about a sense of both the horror of evil, and the inescapable retribution thereof, which speaks of another reality, of a transcendent Justice in much the same way that Dostoyevsky did in Crime and Punishment.

One can only assume that the sheer number of movies that are produced prohibits true quality movies from standing sufficiently out by their sheer quality alone - something darker and more uniquely sinister must be added to the twist.

85233,A1S5B32WYMEE44,0788882988,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[1, 2]","""No Country For Old Men,"" is the latest film faire from the wonderfully creative and humorous Coen Brothers, makers of other gems like Fargo, Blood Simple, Raising Arizona and O Brother Where Are Thou.  So the humor is pretty subtle here and the violence rules the day.  It's a tale retold from Cormac MacCarthy's like-monikered book and like all things Cormac we get tales of men on the run in the vast expanse of South West Texas.Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem all put in fine performances.  Tommy Lee Jones is the aging Texas sheriff, Josh Brolin is the Vietnam vet looking for a break, and Javier Bardem is the personification of evil in a calmly played creepy character with either no conscience whatsoever or an elevated but twisted conscience that puts himself above morality...you be the judge.There are moments throughout the film that stand out.  One of the funnier moments (and you'd have to be a Coen follower to catch it) is when Bardem's character, Chigurh, is driving over a bridge and stops to shoot a pigeon or some other type helpless bird with his big silencer rifle.  It harkens back to Raising Arizona's lone biker of the apocalypse shooting helpless bunnies in the desert.  The Coens are riffing on the Coens...priceless.Was this film oscar-worthy standing up to all the buzz surrounding it?  In my opinion it falls short of those lofty standards but watchable it is.  Entertaining it is.  It is even a deeper than normal dig into some interesting character studies and why they do what they do.  If I was you and I don't think I am but...I'd watch this flick without hesitation.  But do hesitate if you don't care for violence in your Amazon DVD purchases.  I wasn't counting but I think the dead bodies considerably outnumbered the living once in the first 15 minutes of the film.See what the Coen Brothers have been up to lately...see this before you are an old man and there's no country left.--MMW",4,The Coen Bros are Back,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,1940,"['Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'latest', 'film', 'faire', 'wonderfully', 'creative', 'humorous', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'makers', 'other', 'gems', 'Fargo', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Are', 'Thou', 'humor', 'pretty', 'subtle', 'here', 'violence', 'rules', 'day', 'tale', 'retold', 'Cormac', 'MacCarthy', 'like-monikered', 'book', 'things', 'Cormac', 'get', 'tales', 'men', 'run', 'vast', 'expanse', 'South', 'West', 'Texas.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'put', 'fine', 'performances', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'aging', 'Texas', 'sheriff', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'looking', 'break', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'personification', 'evil', 'calmly', 'played', 'creepy', 'character', 'conscience', 'whatsoever', 'elevated', 'twisted', 'conscience', 'morality', 'be', 'judge.There', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'One', 'funnier', 'moments', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'Coen', 'follower', 'catch', 'when', 'Bardem', 'character', 'Chigurh', 'driving', 'over', 'bridge', 'stops', 'shoot', 'pigeon', 'other', 'type', 'helpless', 'bird', 'big', 'silencer', 'rifle', 'back', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'lone', 'biker', 'apocalypse', 'shooting', 'helpless', 'bunnies', 'desert', 'Coens', 'are', 'riffing', 'Coens', 'priceless.Was', 'film', 'oscar-worthy', 'standing', 'up', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'opinion', 'short', 'lofty', 'standards', 'watchable', 'Entertaining', 'even', 'deeper', 'normal', 'dig', 'interesting', 'character', 'studies', 'why', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'am', ""'d"", 'watch', 'flick', 'hesitation', 'do', 'hesitate', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'violence', 'Amazon', 'DVD', 'purchases', 'was', ""n't"", 'counting', 'think', 'dead', 'bodies', 'considerably', 'outnumbered', 'living', 'once', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'film.See', 'what', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'lately', 'see', 'are', 'old', 'man', 'country', 'MMW']",N/A

He's stumbled upon two million dollars in cash after finding the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, and soon enough finds himself hunted by the insanely calm, coin tossing Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem in his Oscar winning role) in 1980 Texas.  In the meantime, World War II vet Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempts to get to Moss and his wife (Kelly MacDonald) before Chigurh does, as the end comes sooner for some others, and the film offers shock after shock, with the Coen Brothers cementing their legacy for unconventional film making.  Possibly one of the most bleak Best Picture winners you'll ever see, the Coen Brothers' No Country for Old Men is a restrained, violent, and starkly poetic vision that could easily be considered a dark, modern-day western if nothing else.  What makes No Country for Old Men so good is the cast of the film, with Bardem and Brolin in particular giving finely nuanced performances, possibly the best of their careers.  Also featuring Woody Harrelson and Garret Dillahunt, No Country for Old Men is definitely not a film for everyone to be sure (as you can tell from reading the negative reviews here).  Those expecting a mainstream crowd pleaser here have certainly come to the wrong place.  However, saying that the film deserves a chance is an understatement, as movies like No Country for Old Men just don't see the light of day too often.

85244,A10X0JN8KTK89H,0788882988,ninjasuperstar,"[3, 5]","I am surprised at the number of negative reviews here.  For some, it seems they don't realize that the Coen brothers didn't write the story of No Country for Old Men.  It's a novel by Cormac McCarthy, and the Coens take great swathes of dialogue and narration verbatim from the book.  I also don't understand what is pretentious about this movie.  It's a fairly straightforward regional thriller set in west Texas in 1980, when violence seem to get more violent as cocaine and heroine started to flow into the United States at an alarming rate.  This new brand of drug dealing gives birth to pure evil, incarnated in the character of Anton Chigurh (played wonderfully by Javier Bardem).  I can see how this kind of a story may not be for everyone.  The violence in this film is serious unlike Raising Arizona and the regionalisms aren't meant to be as funny as in Fargo (although I laughed a lot at the west Texan wit and colloquialisms in this film).The cinematography and sound are excellent as in all Coen brothers' movies, and the acting is spectacular.  Josh Brolin performs well as the resourceful Llewelyn Moss.  He is able to work a scene by himself with no music and no dialogue.  Tommy Lee Jones gives a good performance as a tired old sheriff, Ed Tom Bell.  Even Woody Harrelson does a decent impression of a professional hit man.  But it's Javier Bardem who steals the movie.  He delivers his lines in a measured, very low and gravelly voice.  His Spanish accent comes and goes at surprising times, often in the middle of words.

85249,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,0788882988,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[2, 5]","I have often thought it would be fun to write the plot to a film which was genuinely reflective of how real life unfolds and where no concessions were made to the conventions and impulses of dramatic structure: where the set of narratives, while looking for all the world like they'll lead somewhere, are corrupted, interfered with, or simply lapse through inattention, and are consequently frustrated, transformed, reconstituted and restated on the fly, with no dramatic lesson or deeper metaphyiscal meaning, thus ruining everything before a satisfying outcome is allowed to occur. Not dramatically satisfying, sure, but at least it wold be honest and reflective of how life really is on our side of the silver screen.No Country For Old Men is that sort of film. A few commentators have taken it to task for its failure to live up to story-telling and character development conventions; the plots and histories to which it introduces us don't prescribe satisfying arcs: They start off well enough but are blown off course, interrupted, or subverted. Some see this as a shortfall; to me, it is very much the point.It happens, in small details as much as in the main narrative, right from the beginning: Texan everyman Llewellyn is distracted whilst walking through scrubland to retrieve a deer he has shot. He sees a transverse trail of blood, leading over a hill. He follows it, and as a result never gets to collect the deer: the arc is interrupted. The trail of blood leads to the grisly scene of an aborted drug deal. Bodies everywhere and a ring of shot-up pickups suggest it has not gone to plan: its arc was interrupted. Llewellyn is thereafter drawn, like a puppet on a string, by the unintended consequences of his own actions, fiat and the deliberate pursuit of others, to completely re-sculpt the trajectory of his life. That trajectory is itself interrupted (from the perspective of the narrative of the film) in a quite unexpected way.The unexpected interruption of arcs continues throughout, even in small details: We are introduced to plans and trajectories we know are about to be impaired: An elderly gas station attendant, facing down a man he gradually realises to be a psychopathic killer, recounts briefly the story of his life, and how he came to be at that point at that time. His would-be murderer, Anton Chigurh, flips a dime, and makes facile observations about the fate and destiny of himself, the coin, and the gas station attendant in the same place. Note also the entry and exit from the film of Carson Welles (and for that matter his employer) - both seemingly primed to make a significant dramatic contribution but not ever getting the chance to thanks to events beyond their control. The role of destiny, fate and chance in framing our existences looms large throughout this film.As does the idea of non-verbal, almost innate communication. Chigurh and the gas station attendant carry on what on its face is an anoydyne conversation, but both are entirely aware what is meant and intended. Later, Chigurh and Llewellyn sit either side of a closed door, neither knowing the other is even there, but a spookily unspoken, almost telepathic dialogue carries on between them. It is masterful film-making.And this is not to mention the wonderful cinematography, the clever direction, the assured acting, and the clever soundtrack - where even the absence of sound is as significant and suspenseful. No Country For Old Men is also no film for every man or woman: It's extremely violent and the tension is almost unbearable at times: if you're expecting a purely intellectual journey into the dark heart of the American psyche you might (literally) get a fright: it's an old fashioned hide-behind-the-sofa sort of film into the bargain as well.That said, a second viewing, where the suspense was largely removed, would be highly rewarding. A candidate for DVD release for sure.Olly Buxton",5,"Unconventional, thrilling, and stark.

Yet it is Javier Bardem's hit man character that is so convincing scary that even his haircut looks malicious.

I still don't see why Tommy Lee Jones was even cast in this movie. Yeah, yeah....old men, times change, people change; and all that rubbish.The story was really about Josh Brolin (Llewelyn) who stumbles upon an a large amount of cash from an aborted drug deal gone bad between a bunch of dealers and buyers (everyone's dead on the scene, except one guy in a truck - he's later killed. But not by Brolin). And the Psycho killer, Anton (Javier Bardem) who goes around capping off people shooting bolts into their foreheads, or blowing them away with a suppressed shotgun (right) in his attempts to recover the cash that Llewelyn has taken. Anton acts like sort of an automaton throughout the movie. Sometimes flipping a coin to see if he'll take the life of his next victim (the victim is supposed to ""call it"".

Kellner ""PAK""","[8, 13]","""No Country for Old Men"" Screenplay and directed by Ethan & Joel Cohen1980, rural Texas; Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) a former Vietnam vet and current welder is hunting and has just made what may be a kill but the animal has run. Llewelyn starts tracking the animal's blood trail and stumbles on what appears to be a large drug deal gone wrong. Only one man is still alive but is badly injured. After some additional tracking he finds the last man involved with the deal who has died under a tree with 2 million dollars from the drug deal in his possession. Llewelyn decides to keep the money and returns home. What Llewelyn doesn't realize is that both of the parties involved are very actively seeking the booty from this deal gone bad and through a turn of events find out that Llewelyn is in possession of the money.......This movie is excellent! One of the best, most original movies I have watched in a long time. The Cohen brothers have worked magic on this movie. The film has a very faded and dark, almost noir type look at times which was perfect for the era and location. One interesting thing I noticed is there is not very much sound track to this movie and what you do hear is very, very subtle, which seems to intensify the suspense.  Another interesting element to this movie is that it seems to cross multiple genres. At times it feels like a drama/suspense movie, at others a horror movie. Sometimes it feels like a chase movie and some it even feels like a comedy.The Good: The story was great. The Cohen brothers managed to take a relatively simple type of story, (AKA guy finds loot and tries to keep if from the bad guy) and turn it into something very complex feeling. The acting was great from all of the actors. I still have trouble picturing Josh Brolin as Bran from ""The Goonies"". Javier Bardem's performance as Anton Chigurh was masterful and could not have been performed better by anyone else. The mood, tone, setting, soundtrack, acting and story telling all combined perfectly for a great, edge of your seat movie experience.The Bad: This wasn't a problem for me but this movie is very, very violent and some may find some of the violence borderline disturbing.Overall: If you can handle the violence, do not hesitate, get your eyes and ears on a copy of this movie ASAP.",5,Edge of your seat thrill ride,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,2302,"['Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Screenplay', 'directed', 'Ethan', 'Joel', 'Cohen1980', 'rural', 'Texas', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'former', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'current', 'welder', 'hunting', 'just', 'made', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'kill', 'animal', 'run', 'Llewelyn', 'tracking', 'animal', 'blood', 'trail', 'stumbles', 'what', 'be', 'large', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Only', 'one', 'man', 'still', 'alive', 'badly', 'injured', 'additional', 'tracking', 'last', 'man', 'involved', 'deal', 'who', 'died', 'tree', '2', 'million', 'dollars', 'drug', 'deal', 'possession', 'Llewelyn', 'keep', 'money', 'home', 'What', 'Llewelyn', ""n't"", 'realize', 'parties', 'involved', 'are', 'very', 'actively', 'seeking', 'booty', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', 'turn', 'events', 'find', 'out', 'Llewelyn', 'possession', 'money', '.This', 'movie', 'excellent', 'One', 'best', 'most', 'original', 'movies', 'have', 'watched', 'long', 'time', 'Cohen', 'brothers', 'have', 'worked', 'magic', 'movie', 'film', 'very', 'faded', 'dark', 'almost', 'noir', 'type', 'look', 'times', 'was', 'perfect', 'era', 'location', 'One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'noticed', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'sound', 'track', 'movie', 'what', 'do', 'hear', 'very', 'very', 'subtle', 'intensify', 'suspense', 'interesting', 'element', 'movie', 'cross', 'multiple', 'genres', 'times', 'drama/suspense', 'movie', 'others', 'horror', 'movie', 'chase', 'movie', 'even', 'comedy.The', 'Good', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'Cohen', 'brothers', 'managed', 'take', 'relatively', 'simple', 'type', 'story', 'AKA', 'guy', 'loot', 'tries', 'keep', 'bad', 'guy', 'turn', 'something', 'very', 'complex', 'feeling', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'actors', 'still', 'have', 'trouble', 'picturing', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Bran', 'Goonies', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'performance', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'was', 'masterful', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'performed', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'mood', 'tone', 'setting', 'soundtrack', 'acting', 'story', 'telling', 'combined', 'perfectly', 'great', 'edge', 'seat', 'movie', 'experience.The', 'Bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'violent', 'may', 'find', 'violence', 'borderline', 'disturbing.Overall', 'can', 'handle', 'violence', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'get', 'eyes', 'ears', 'copy', 'movie', 'ASAP']",N/A

The thing is, they have to watch a lot of movies, and as we all know, the vast majority of movies are perfectly horrible.  So when the critic comes across something that is mildly interesting or relatively well-made, they sometimes can't help themselves but to gush praise all over it.  That, I think, is what happened with Old Men, which has been given a rather remarkable amount of critical acclaim, but which will be looked upon in twenty years or so as just another mediocre thriller.It does have its good points.  For once, the Coen brothers played it straight, rather than snickering at their audience from behind the screen, and what do you know:  they are actually quite skilled at the art of film-making!  They take their time to set the mood of the film, with long, panoramic views of the desolate Texas landscape.  These might very well serve as a metaphor for the mayhem and chaos later depicted.  They are also very good at building tension.  A couple of scenes, particularly the hotel scene with the murderer creeping about in the hallway, are quite riveting.  And they managed to come up with some really terrific acting, particularly the smaller roles.  Every single one of these people--the store owner, the hotel clerk, the border guard--are absolutely authentic.The problem with the film is the problem that plagued the book:  the plot.  In a nutshell, our hero finds a stash of money, decides to keep it, then spends the rest of the film trying to get away from the malevolent forces that want it back.  Good grief, hasn't this been done about a million times?  And wouldn't you know, the malevolent force is practically superhumanly evil and indestructible.  And hasn't THAT been done about a million times?  My goodness, the alien, the predator, the terminator, Hannibal Lecter, the Godfather, Colonel Kurtz . . . you can't hardly turn on the TV without seeing an indestructible, superhuman, evil murderer roaming around!The difference perhaps is that the murderer in this movie, Chigurh, spends a lot of time mumbling about fate and destiny and that sort of thing--just before he blows somebody's brains out with his cattle gun (a super-evil tool!) or his shotgun--which somehow means that we're supposed to take all of this ludicrous mayhem seriously.  Obviously, a lot of critics did, but don't be fooled.

Using locales as diverse as wintery North Dakota (""Fargo) ) they tell universal stories of alienation and isolation.  But in ""No Country for Old Men,"" they have hit on the truly scary theme of amoral, mindless violence.  The plot is relatively straightforward: a gang of outlaws gets into a shootout that leaves half a dozen men and animals dead.  A drifter (Josh Brolin) wanders across the scene and finds a suitcase stuffed with two million dollars in drug money. He takes off for parts unknown, followed by the killer, Javier Bardem, and later by the Sheriff, Tommy Lee Jones, and finally by a hitman hired by the drug lords.The serial killer stays one step behind the drifter, following a signal from a transponder hidden in the bag. What happens when the killer employs his weapon of choice, an air-powered cattle gun, is too graphic to retell here.That might be the end of the story, but there are several layers involved.The rules of the Old West have been turned on their head, with the lawmen grasping at invisible straws, and the bad guys seemingly beyond the pale of civilization.This is an extraordinarily good ensemble cast.  Tommy Lee Jones is as good as I've ever seen him; Josh Brolin is excellent, and Javier Bardem richly deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. Even the bit parts are good (the old man who runs the general store and who survives because of a coin toss)  The cinematography is as gritty and merciless as the terrain where it was shot.

Three people sitting behind me cussed the screen when the movie was over.  Part of me was saying they didn't get it.  Another part was saying they weren't supposed to.No Country for Old Men is a top notch suspense thriller by the Coen Brothers.  The characters and dialogue are carved so well that you can't help but get taken in.  But if you ask me what the film is about, I'll tell you it involves some deal gone wrong and a Texas man ends up running all over the state trying to keep the money while staying alive.  If you ask me what the film means, I might tell you to pick up the book.  It'll serve you better.As suspense thrillers go, this is great.  It's a chase around Texas.  If you're from Texas, you'll know they got it right.  The Coen's have these sparse locations where you'll feel just a tad afraid because of the isolation.  I particularly love the showdown between Josh Brolin and Javier Bardien in Eagle Pass.  It's shot at night and wondering when and where Bardien's terrifying Anton Sigur is going to strike simply leaves you on the edge.The talent involved is superb. Bardien deservedly got a lot of attention for his role as Anton Sigur, commanding attention anytime he's on screen.  He is easily the best villain I've seen in years.  Josh Brolin is something of an unsung hero though, easily slipping into the shoes of a man who knows he's gotten himself into deep as he's on the run through Texas.  Kelly MacDonald is almost recognizable as his wife.  I didn't know it was her until someone told me.  Then there's the infallible Tommy Lee Jones, not once sharing a scene with Brolin or Bardien, but nonetheless helps paint a picture of the horror going on around him as the officer who stumbles upon the case.  Jones' deliver is sharp, dry, and even has a bit of humor and, if you follow the film's themes, is really the heart of the story.The film deals with some rather challenging themes which the Coen Brothers paint quite well in some scenes, particularly when Bardien and Brolin's characters deal with more youthful characters in separate scenes.  The result is nothing short of poetic.  But this leads to the conclusion, which I will not spoil, but will say it involves analysys.  This is where I have take one star off of an otherwise perfect film.  The ending challenges us but also leaves us asking the question I posed earlier - what exactly does this film mean?  The ending functions better on paper.  It's smart, but a bit much for a movie that is filled with suspense and a good dose of action, almost playing down everything you just saw as rather trivial.  It's okay if you like it, but don't be ashamed if you don't like it or don't get it.",4,Great Coen Brothers flick - but a bit too smart for its own good *possible spoilers*,1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,2766,"['watched', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'theatre', '5', 'other', 'people', 'Three', 'people', 'sitting', 'cussed', 'screen', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'Part', 'was', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'part', 'was', 'saying', 'were', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'to.No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'top', 'notch', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'are', 'carved', 'so', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'taken', 'ask', 'what', 'film', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Texas', 'man', 'up', 'running', 'state', 'trying', 'keep', 'money', 'staying', 'alive', 'ask', 'what', 'film', 'might', 'tell', 'pick', 'up', 'book', ""'ll"", 'serve', 'better.As', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'go', 'great', 'chase', 'Texas', ""'re"", 'Texas', ""'ll"", 'know', 'got', 'right', 'Coen', 'have', 'sparse', 'locations', 'where', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'just', 'tad', 'afraid', 'isolation', 'particularly', 'love', 'showdown', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Javier', 'Bardien', 'Eagle', 'Pass', 'shot', 'night', 'wondering', 'when', 'where', 'Bardien', 'terrifying', 'Anton', 'Sigur', 'going', 'strike', 'simply', 'edge.The', 'talent', 'involved', 'superb', 'Bardien', 'deservedly', 'got', 'lot', 'attention', 'role', 'Anton', 'Sigur', 'commanding', 'attention', 'screen', 'easily', 'best', 'villain', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'something', 'unsung', 'hero', 'easily', 'slipping', 'shoes', 'man', 'who', 'gotten', 'deep', 'run', 'Texas', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'almost', 'recognizable', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'someone', 'told', 'Then', 'infallible', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'not', 'once', 'sharing', 'scene', 'Brolin', 'Bardien', 'nonetheless', 'paint', 'picture', 'horror', 'going', 'around', 'officer', 'who', 'case', 'Jones', 'deliver', 'sharp', 'dry', 'even', 'bit', 'humor', 'follow', 'film', 'themes', 'really', 'heart', 'story.The', 'film', 'deals', 'rather', 'challenging', 'themes', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'paint', 'quite', 'well', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'when', 'Bardien', 'Brolin', 'characters', 'deal', 'more', 'youthful', 'characters', 'separate', 'scenes', 'result', 'nothing', 'short', 'poetic', 'conclusion', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'will', 'say', 'analysys', 'where', 'have', 'take', 'one', 'star', 'otherwise', 'perfect', 'film', 'ending', 'challenges', 'also', 'asking', 'question', 'posed', 'earlier', 'what', 'exactly', 'film', 'mean', 'ending', 'functions', 'better', 'paper', 'smart', 'bit', 'much', 'movie', 'filled', 'suspense', 'good', 'dose', 'action', 'almost', 'playing', 'down', 'everything', 'just', 'saw', 'rather', 'trivial', 'okay', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'ashamed', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'get']",N/A
85281,ANM2SCEUL3WL1,0788882988,Pristine,"[8, 11]","I have to say, my primary love for this movie stems from my love of a good chase.  We're not talking about a high-speed Steve McQueen Bullitt chase here.  As a child, I've always been electrified by forces that were unstoppable, made only the more ominous by it's slow persistence and insistence.  In this movie, the Coen Brothers, matured from their early days of the ultimate chase scene (Raising Arizona), have found the most deadly chase in our lifetime.  That force (much like water, rust, or time) embodies itself in Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurr.Chigurr's slow, logical, and unceasing advance, increasingly closing in on Josh Brolin - who finds a stash of 2 million dollars amidst a drug deal gone bad - is really an allegory of time.  Tommy Lee Jones is the sheriff who is quickly becoming an anachronism in an era (1980s) of violent drug dealers and a new wave of criminals.  With a wonderful face full of lines, each revealing an American story of the Southwest, Jones is our gentle narrator, creating vast soliloquies from a few strong and silent sentences in conversations with characters he encounters, painting a vision of days gone by, when lawmen didn't need guns.  Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald is adorable, playing the trailer park wife with an antiquated softness that has all but disappeared in modern times.A virtuoso move that displays just how advanced the Coens have come in their craft is the decision to omit gratuitous violence onscreen.  When viewers are denied what has become a part of our collective cinema consciousness anyway, we are instructed through storytelling that violence in the real world is mostly random...to the point where the movie camera doesn't even show up on time for some of the biggest bloodletting scenes.The beautiful light of the Southeast reverberate with visions of Georgia O'Keefe's paintings from New Mexico.

And it is practically almost a spellbinding masterpiece all the way through. My problem with this film is that it lacks any real ending. If any movie could be accused of just shutting down right when the final act is about to begin, it would be 'No country for old men'. The character Josh Brolin plays ends up hunting down the assassin that is hunting him down, but he never catches up to the assassin once he decides to hunt him down. Tommy Lee Jones and his character are trying to find Brolin's character so he can help protect him from this seriously highly trained killer, but Tommy Lee's character never catches up with him either or Brolin's character. The killer threatens to kill Brolin's Girlfriend, and we never discover what, if anything the killer did with her. Right when these secrets might be unveiled the film ends without notice and it feels like it is missing the final act. I was glued to the screen through the whole film and the point where this film ends ruined the whole thing for me. Also I wonder what is happening with Hollywood. Films that are winning best picture nods now days would have never even been considered for Oscars 10 years ago. Films like this one would have been considered nowhere near as Oscar worthy as films that grabbed the best film category a decade ago. The same goes for last years best picture nod 'The Departed'. A great movie but nowhere near as great as most of Scorsese's earlier films like 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', 'The age of Innocence' 'Taxi driver' or 'Raging Bull'. Yet Departed pretty much was the best film last year which kind of shows that the quality of Hollywood movies has gone down hill the past few years.

When I first viewed it in the theater, quite frankly I was NOT well for the ending.  Absolutely no loose ends were tied up.  A subsequent viewing helped me realize it was for the best.  How the story ends becomes very much an individual affair, especially when the Brothers themselves veered from the original novel ending.When the interpretation of a work is totally up to the viewer, that, of course, always makes for a more compelling artistic presentation simply because the art does not do your thinking for you:  this one is no different.Hands down, the most salient aspect of this was the performance of Javier Bardem and his Oscar was, in my humble opinion, well-deserved.  His disturbing calm was most disconcerting.  You did not (or more aptly, COULD not) invest anything into him emotionally.  This was indeed deliberate.  There was no need to, actually, to adequately present the story.  Even Llewellen (Josh Brolin's character) you felt something for, and Tommy Lee Jones, who, regardless of the character, ALWAYS manages to make you care about him, was probably the most fleshed-out character.Actually the movie was not as slow as one is led to believe...it is most deliberate and since the Brothers get right to the point at the very beginning, you are indeed intensely involved with how this will play itself out. To be perfectly honest, this is hardly the best Coen brothers outing; the advance buzz vomited such phrases as ""the greatest thing the Coens have done,"" ""a masterpiece,"" ""monumental achievement,"" blah, blah, blah; Realizing that this is the nature of the publicity beast,  my immediate reaction upon my first viewing was ""It was good but certainly not all that.""If you are a Coen Brothers fan, you will certainly appreciate it.

My initial reaction was one of emotional exhaustion.  This movie held me at the edge of my seat from beginning to end but gave me nothing that I could hold on to.  To elaborate more might spoil part of the effect of ""No Country for Old Men"" and I guess I benefitted from being totally unaware of what was going to happen next throughout the whole movie.  Therefore, without discussing the plot in any detail, what makes this an excellent film?""No Country for Old Men"" has many strong attributes including a constant onslaught of dramatic action and suspense.  We start out with a situation that demands explanation and we are constantly confronted by successive scenarios that demands explanation and/or resolution.  The cinematography, at times, was brilliant.  However, for me, the key to ""No Country for Old Men"" is the casting and that includes top billing to honorable mention.  Woody Harrelson seemed to not fit the bill until I realized that he was everything his character was supposed to be (including being somewhat cocky and obnoxious).  My nominee for the Best Supporting Actor was the guy at the gas station.  That was another one of those scenes in which had several possible outcomes and it was this guy who made the scene such a memorable one.The problem with the movie, for me, was What are we supposed to get out of it????  Evil reigns supreme???  The ending underscored the lack of any coherence.  What was that all about???  I realize that there is a connection to the film's title but that would be either too shallow for what we had just seen or too distracting.

As main character Moss runs into mess of human and canine bodies and finds $2MM drug money during his hunting trip, we get to see the determination of the former Vietnam vet to turn the life of his family around once he has a full possesion of his money. As he tries to avoid drug dealers, former special operations soldiers and a serial killer he gets on to fight for his life as if he is back in the war fields.  We track him pacing between US and Mexican border, beaten, battered and wounded attempting with all his might to preserve the money he found in order to ensure a better life for himself and his wife.  Javier Bardem plays a killer who kills indiscriminately everyone on his path.  He needs no other reason to kill them but the fact that people see his face or loose the coin toss bet to dispose of them.  He fights by the principals that are stronger money, power or any other values we are used to.  He makes his own rules.  Ending is somewhat unexpected, but than again this is a Coen Brothers' movie and they have their own way of presenting reality to their audience.  I expected more from this movie.

Brolin and Lee Jones give excellent performances as the sympathetic characters, as do Kelly Macdonald and Woody Harrelson (as the two more prolific supporting actors in the piece), but the show belongs wholly to Javier Bardem, whose studied, intense portrayal of Anton is absolutely terrifying and totally absorbing.Direction is superlative: beautiful to watch, effectively tense and very layered; the Coen-brand intelligence is never more palpable when you consider the parallels between the characters of Anton and Llewelyn, and then see the visual motifs of isolation and seclusion that the Coens use to underscore this most bizarre of relationships (deserted streets, darkened motel rooms, arid deserts and so forth).From a storytelling point of view, things don't begin to make sense for a half an hour or so, cleverly allowing Brolin, Bardem and Lee Jones ample time to make their presence felt - another clever touch, and one that adds more punch and muscle to this film's character-driven atmosphere.And then, just when you're absolutely certain that you've been treated to two hours of the finest cinema to come out of North America for a long time, the ending jumps on you and you're left with more questions than answers: this plot device is fine for a sense of ambiguity and moral questioning, but this reviewer can't help but wonder if ""No Country For Old Men"" wouldn't have been more satisfying with slightly more resolution?Still, for all that, this is a brutal and brilliant masterpiece, and one which you absolutely  shouldn't not see.

The Cohen's treatment of it, however, is an entirely different matter and surely would please the author. The dark and violent theme is perfectly realised without distracting moralizing. No doubt the Cohens feasted with the script's permission to express the gore, the blood spill, the power of weaponry and splintered bone.The balance between Bardem's implaccable evil, Jone's diminished and despairing Lawman, and the resourceful Brolin is held in unrelenting tension through 'til the credit roll.

He is granted the opening and closing words of the narrative but has no control over the unfolding mayhem. It's an exemplary performance, the one amongst the three leads which possesses some creditable psychological depth. Barden's automatonic stance might have dwindled to caricature but for the calm intelligence he brings to his repartee. Where does this fit in the Cohen's canon?

85304,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,0788882988,R. Kyle,"[17, 30]","What's the difference between a good film and a great one?  I know Film Appreciation classes try to normalize those answers by giving parameters by which to judge, but I still believe actual answers are as unique as the members of the audience.In my case, greatness is defined by the number of snippets of the individual films that are engraved in your mind. For example, the scene in ""Casablanca"" where the Germans at Rick's are singing their national anthem and everyone else joins together to sing the French national anthem louder.  I once had the privilege to see ""Casablanca"" screened at the Paramount in Austin and heard the stillness as the first words in French sounded--then the thundering applause at the end.Add a second quality.  Great films make me think--whether I want to or not.I didn't come out of the theatre this evening with a 5-star rating for ""No Country For Old Men.""  I sat down twice before this to write the review for this film and walked away.  Now, I'm up at 4:21 AM still considering events and dialogue and I htink I'm ready to write.At the very first, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) delivers a monologue against a West Texas backdrop.  He's a third-generation lawman who knows of a time when the Sheriffs didn't carry a gun...The times are changing (kids now have green hair and bones in their noses), but he still looks back on that prior generation as a role model.Next, a Texas deputy is in the process of arresting a Hispanic man (Javier Bardem).  The Deputy takes him into the station and calls the Sheriff commenting that the man had an oxygen tank and a hose kind of like someone with emphysema. That deputy was dead wrong.A hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is shooting at some pronghorn deer.  He hits one, but doesn't make the kill shot.  In his search for the wounded animal, he comes across a drug deal gone bad.  Both parties had apparently gone ""Wild West"" on each other, leaving a pickup bed full of heroin and 2 million dollars in cash in a suitcase.  Moss leaves with the suitcase full of money, but returns later that night to take a drink of water to the only survivor, a Hispanic man. One of the best scenes in that film occurs between Moss and his wife Carla Jean (Kelly McDonald) as he's leaving:Moss:  If I don't come back, tell Mama I love herCarla Jean:  Llewelyn, your Mama's been dead 20 yearsMoss:  Then I'll tell her myselfBy the time Moss returned to the scene, the 'corporate people' are looking for the drugs and money. Chigurh killed them, but where's the money?This sets Anton Chigurh (Bardem) on Moss' tail.  He's not just a gangland fix it man, Chigurh may well now be the Energizer Bunny of Sociopathic Killers.  He moves through Texas like a tornado--wreaking havoc wherever he goes, but occasionally whimsically sparing a person.Many reviewers have offered up ""No COuntry"" as an Oscar contender and I certainly would agree it's a possibility.  Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh is as fascinating as it is hair raising. Brolin and McDonald definitely deserve a nod as supporting cast. McDonald particularly stood up to Bardem very well.I offer up three cautions to people planning on attending this film:1.  Don't attend ""No Country"" when you're looking for passive entertainment.  Yes, there's plenty of that to be had--but the film is much more than chases and gunfights and you need to be paying attention to understand what's happening.  (I'm planning on going back by myself to review some bits I didn't quite understand)2.  If high violence with concomitant bloodshed and tension are problems for you, be advised that ""No Country"" is ""no film for the squeamish or faint of heart.""3.

I just saw the film last night and felt pretty much the same way about it as a felt about Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed""; all flash, no crash.First off, the actors in this film are absolutely brilliant. Bardem was chillingly creepy and the hitman without conscience or remorse and Tommy Lee Jones was excellent and likable as always.The film starts off with a bang and keeps you rivited....until the very end.Just like ""The Departed"", ""No Country"" just abruptly.....ends.

When it was all over, I felt cheated out of an ending.Yeah. The world is a violent place. Our society is going to hell in a handbasket and all that, but for the makers of this film to feel that they are making some profound statement about the nature of humanity and passing it off as art is downright arrogant and pretentious.Sorry, folks. In my opinion (and it's ONLY that; an opinion), this film is a letdown and completely unworthy of even an Oscar NOMINATION, let alone the winner for best picture. I've seen MUCH better films in 2007.On a side note, I love that fact that this site exists so people can share their opinions and viewpoints about films such as this, but it would be a lot better if everyone would just stop criticizing and attacking each other just because their opinions are different.

Even some of their less successful movies always leave me delighted because they dare play around with tone and audience expectations.  Who but this brotherly team would attempt a movie like THE LADYKILLERS or MAN WHO WASN'T THERE?  But in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, they return to their true forte...the crime thriller.Although my personal favorite is RAISING ARIZONA...it is probably true that in decades from now the Coens will be best remembered and admired for BLOOD SIMPLE, FARGO, MILLER'S CROSSING and now their adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's bleak Southwest thriller.NO COUNTRY...tells the story of how one simple man (Josh Brolin), out on a hunting trip somewhere in the vast emptiness of west Texas, stumbles across the scene of a drug deal gone bad.  Empty pickup trucks, dead men everywhere, and one lone survivor.  This dying man asks for water (which Brolin doesn't have) and then Brolin finds a big bag full of about $2 million.  He takes the money, not really thinking about the consequences.  We find that he lives in a single wide mobile home with his attractive but too compliant wife.We think Brolin is a simple and probably heartless man...but when he decides he needs to go back and give that dying man some water...his moment of kindness is his undoing.  He is discovered and soon his is identified.  Now he's being hunted by the authorities, the drug dealers and most awfully, he's being chased by Anton Chugurh (Javier Bardem), who could be one of the most malevolent serial killers / hitmen in movie history.Brolin sends his family into hiding and goes on the run himself.  He hops from one rundown hotel room to another, leaving a trail of death and violence following him.  And drawing ever closer is Bardem...calm, steady and absolutely convinced that he will recover the money and kill the man who took it.Trying to sort everything out is Tommy Lee Jones as the local sheriff, who feels that not only is he in over his head (although we see very early on that he has a native instinct and craftiness for his work that actually make s him a pretty brilliant investigator)...but he feels that society itself has moved on without him.  The scenes of violence he encounters are beyond anything he's experienced.  He is afraid, but worse than that, he is spiritually shaken.These three men, and a host of supporting characters (including a well-cast Woody Harrelson) chase each other around...and just the chase itself would make an entertaining film.  But what we have here is a film that makes us smell the desperation, feel the emptiness and loneliness of the landscape AND the people who live there.  This is a brutal and non-compromising film.It's so great because it is splendidly entertaining...and yet it fills you with a tension that goes beyond the simple plot developments.  In a way, we begin to feel about the events much the same way that Tommy Lee Jones feels.  We are invited into his inner turmoil...and we feel it.  And as always, the Coens are utter masters of tone.  They know exactly how funny they want humorous scenes to be and exactly how to turn tension up and down.  Then just up and up and up.It is a VERY well acted film. Bardem will almost certainly be nominated for an Oscar...and he deserves it.  What a role!  He's a complete success at conveying emptiness.  He kills with no pleasure...but he has also made killing his first line of action in almost any situation.  I guess he's just learned that this is the best way to solve problems and get people out of the way.  Bardem is riveting.  It's a complete clich&eacute; to say ""you can't keep your eyes off him,"" but I'm comfortable reporting that for me, I couldn't keep my eyes off him.  It's a brilliant creation of McCarthy's...interpreted by the Coen Brothers and then brought to amazing life by Bardem.Brolin gives by far his finest performance.  With this performance and his role in AMERICAN GANGSTER, he must now be taken seriously as an actor.  Jones is the ONLY actor who could have played his part...he's that good and that iconic.  What other actor do we know who should be playing a grizzled Texas lawman in the modern age?  Robert Duvall perhaps?  Other than that, the list only includes Jones.I must warn you...you almost certainly will not like the ending.  McCarthy has never felt the need to wrap up his stories in a tidy package (doing so would in fact undo much of what he's trying to say about life) and the Coens have not shied away from his vision.  I found the ending a little jolting myself...until I took the time to reflect on what it meant and how it made me feel.  Then I understood a little better how brilliant it was.This is easily one of the most satisfying, most artistically mature and most viscerally entertaining movies of the year!

85310,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0788882988,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 10]","No Country for Old Men (Joel and Ethan Coen, 2007)The Coen Brothers show, finally, that it is possible to successfully adapt a Cormac McCarthy novel to film. With adaptations of The Road (to be directed by John Hillcoat) and Blood Meridian (to be directed by Ridley Scott) on the horizon, that is quite a comforting thing.The plot, what there is of it, seems to center around Llewellyn Moss (Grindhouse's Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon the scene of a drug deal gone bad, and walks off with a satchel containing two million dollars. The owners of the money want it back, and so they hire psychotic escaped criminal Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) to track the money and get it back. On the other side of the equation is Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the sherriff in the district where the drug deal went down, and Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), an associate of Chigurh's who's a little less nuts, and is willing to let Moss live as long as he hands over the cash.This is a movie that succeeds on so many levels it's scary. Before getting to the obvious, however, the main reason for this movie's success, it seems to me, is the work of cinematographer Roger Deakins, whose use of light and shadow is a character in itself; the light (or lack of same) in this movie is a virtuoso performance, easily on the level of Darius Khondji's work on Se7en or Frank Byers' on Twin Peaks. There are dozens of scenes I could single out (and other critics have, with many of them) to illustrate the greatness to be found in the cinematography here, but one of the scenes that seems, on the surface, pedestrian really blew me away: there's a scene where Moss is in a motel room. He turns off the light, and the drapes are closed, so we see only a thin line of light coming in under the drapes, and all it illuminates is a part of Moss' cowboy hat, sitting on the bed. His hand comes into the light, picks up the hat, and then there's nothing for a few seconds until Moss opens the door and walks out. When was the last time you saw a scene like that in a film? It's gutsy. More to the point, its minimalism offsets the rest of the film, with its glorious over-the-top (and yet disturbingly realistic) violence. The Coens spend two hours putting the pedal to the floor in this movie; even the quiet scenes are tense. And here, in the middle, there's something that really is quiet; it's tense, but it's not ""Anton Chigurh is sitting in the chair across from you"" tense. Deakins was justly nominated for the Best Cinematography Academy Award, and it will be a crime if he doesn't collect.The movie has also been nominated for seven other Oscars, including Best Picture (and I have to say that it is, far and away, the best film I've seen released in 2007, as of this writing), Best Director, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Sound, Sound Editing, and Supporting Actor. Odd that only one actor in this flick got an Oscar nod (and that being Javier Bardem, who is racking up ignored Oscar-worthy performances just as fast as Willem Dafoe; Bardem deserves this Oscar, as he has deserved many others, but odds are he won't win), since so many folks in this movie do such an excellent job. Tommy Lee Jones hasn't been this good on a screen in over two decades, and I say this as someone who's loved a lot of the movies he's made in the interim. Harrelson turns in his best performance since Natural Born Killers. Kelly MacDonald, who here plays Moss' clueless wife, is amazing. I've seen her before, but she never really registered with me. Barry Corbin and Trent Moore both have excellent bit parts. Bardem, of course, is always fantastic; there are many movies that are worth seeing just to watch the man act.What is most impressive here, however, despite all the accolades I've heaped on this film (and will continue to heap on it), is that despite the fact that the Coens have made an unflinchingly violent action movie, they have done so in such a way that it is still an absolutely beautiful film. It's pleasing to look at on just about every level.Even the bits that are difficult to watch keep you riveted simply because they're so well-framed and so perfectly shot.

85311,A277MYG7MQTKYW,0788882988,Robert Blenheim,"[4, 7]","This is the Coen Brothers' finest work. Based on the novel by Southern writer Cormac McCarthy, this is an instant American film classic that should be talked about and studied for decades to come.The story involves Mexican drug money, a Vietnam War veteran who finds it, an elderly Sheriff who's about to retire, a bounty hunter who thinks he can beat the odds, and a psychotic killer with a cattlegun, a sociopath the like of which you haven't seen on the screen since Hannibal Lechter. Underneath its harsh realism set in a small Texas town, the film paints a mournful portrait of America in the process of change with a sadness about the passing of a more innocent time, a theme reminiscent of the films of Sam Peckinpah. The film's acting, from every lead player to the smallest character walk-on, is perfection itself, but it is the portrait of killer Anton Chigurh by Javier Bardem that should live forever in film history. The film's composition of shots and timing of its editing is the finest case study in cinematic precision since the great works of Alfred Hitchcock (for example, just watch the tension created by the crinkling of the slowly unfolding candy wrapper).The most controversial part of the film is its last fifteen minutes, a conclusion that leaves most audiences dissatisfied, but there is something special going on here, and the Coen Brothers know what they're doing. If you invest some time thinking about it, and perhaps see the film again, you might experience a small epiphany and discover that the Coen Brothers have pulled a kind of alienation trick and refocused the film as a morality tale about the nature of evil. In that sense, the resolution can be seen as perfect.  What you will be left with are many questions. But I can only tell you to see this masterpiece, one of the great films the new century has given us, and know exactly what great provocative cinematic art is all about.",5,QUINTESSENTIAL COEN BROTHERS AT THEIR BEST!,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,1922,"['Coen', 'Brothers', 'finest', 'work', 'Based', 'novel', 'Southern', 'writer', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'instant', 'American', 'film', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'talked', 'studied', 'decades', 'come.The', 'story', 'involves', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'money', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'veteran', 'who', 'elderly', 'Sheriff', 'who', 'retire', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'who', 'can', 'beat', 'odds', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'cattlegun', 'sociopath', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'screen', 'Hannibal', 'Lechter', 'Underneath', 'harsh', 'realism', 'set', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'film', 'mournful', 'portrait', 'America', 'process', 'change', 'sadness', 'passing', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'theme', 'reminiscent', 'films', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'film', 'acting', 'lead', 'player', 'smallest', 'character', 'walk-on', 'perfection', 'portrait', 'killer', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'should', 'live', 'forever', 'film', 'history', 'film', 'composition', 'shots', 'timing', 'editing', 'finest', 'case', 'study', 'cinematic', 'precision', 'great', 'works', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'example', 'just', 'watch', 'tension', 'created', 'crinkling', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'candy', 'wrapper', 'most', 'controversial', 'part', 'film', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'conclusion', 'most', 'audiences', 'dissatisfied', 'something', 'special', 'going', 'here', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'invest', 'time', 'thinking', 'perhaps', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'might', 'experience', 'small', 'epiphany', 'discover', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'pulled', 'kind', 'alienation', 'trick', 'refocused', 'film', 'morality', 'tale', 'nature', 'evil', 'sense', 'resolution', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'perfect', 'What', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'are', 'many', 'questions', 'can', 'only', 'tell', 'see', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'new', 'century', 'given', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'great', 'provocative', 'cinematic', 'art']",N/A

85319,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0788882988,Roland E. Zwick,"[323, 418]","In the stylish new Coen Brothers' movie, ""No Country for Old Men,"" the violence is both graphic and coy, both in-your-face and strangely demur in the way it is portrayed.  Bit players are frequently blown away in full view of the audience, while key characters often meet their ends off screen, away from the spotlight of the prying camera.  For this is the theme of the movie, that violence is arbitrary, capricious and unpredictable, and that things are only going to get worse in a culture that has grown increasingly coarse and indifferent to human suffering over the years.The ""old man"" of the title is Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a small town Texas sheriff who, right on the verge of retirement, has seen a depressing spike in violent crime thanks to the recent proliferation of drug-running from Mexico (the movie takes place in 1980).  For this is a ""new time"" in America, one in which an all-out criminal ""war"" is being fought, as much on the open plains as in the crowded cities.  It is the ""old men"" like Bell, the last in a long line of old style Texas lawmen, who can no longer recognize their country and who are left to recede into the background bewildered and frustrated by their inability to do anything about it.As the story opens, a group of men lie dead in a windswept field, victims of a drug deal gone terribly awry.  The perpetrator is a psychopath by the name of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is now wandering the countryside on a random killing spree, dispatching human victims as casually as the rest of us would a mosquito or fly.  Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a ""retired"" welder  who stumbles upon not only the carnage-strewn scene but a suitcase filled with millions of dollars in unmarked bills.  When Moss makes the fatal mistake of taking the loot, he becomes the prime target of Chigurh, who will stop at nothing to get what is rightfully his.Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, ""No Country For Old Men"" is less notable for its story and characters than for its cinematic naturalism and impressionistic style.  Despite having made some truly exceptional films in the past, Joel and Ethan Coen have never been as thoroughly in control of their medium or as supremely confident in their filmmaking as they are here.  The first hour, in particular, is such a flawless masterpiece of composition and tone that it will probably be studied as a model in film school courses for years to come.  Not since the films of Terrance Malick has landscape been used to more brilliant effect than in the opening section of this work.  The setting - so brilliantly captured in Roger Deakins' incisive cinematography and Craig Berkey`s stunning sound design - becomes a palpable presence in its own right and a key player in the drama.  The Coens have done their own editing on the film, which explains why the pacing feels like an exquisitely honed piece of music, built on finely calibrated beats and rests, meter and rhythm.  The hypnotic, dreamlike quality of the filmmaking carries the story into the realm of archetype and myth which matches perfectly the surrealistic nature of the piece.Bardem provides a bone-chilling portrait of a human killing-machine whose sole purpose in life is to destroy that which gets in his way (not that he doesn't enjoy killing just for the sheer pleasure of it as well).  In Bardem's hands, Chigurh becomes the true incarnation of evil in its darkest form.  Jones brings a world-weary gravity to the role of the sheriff, while Brolin, who gets the majority of the screen time in the film, does some of the best work of his career as the man desperate to keep one step ahead of his pursuer.Perhaps predictably, the movie is not able to sustain the same level of greatness all the way through its running time and there are moments when the filmmakers seem to lose their way somewhat (particularly when Woody Harrelson shows up as a comic-relief bounty hunter).  The unresolved ending may frustrate those who don't like any loose ends hanging around at the end of a story, but the inconclusiveness of the conclusion actually adds to the verisimilitude of the movie quite a bit.Still, even if the movie falters a bit towards the end, there's no denying that ""No Country For Old Men"" is one of the outstanding films of recent times.

The exposition is underwritten, leaving you without a shred of backstory about the Bardem character.  A drug deal goes bad in the desert leaving bloodshed, bodies, drugs and a satchel of drug money in its wake, money that Josh Brolin chances upon and appropriates.  But a psychopathic murderer, Anton Chigurh, played by Bardem is soon on his path in pursuit of that money, killing everyone in his way, although how exactly he is able to track Brolin right out of the gate, and at just about every turn, is never adequately explained.  Even the transponder signal coming from the drug satchel would not allow this kind of close tracking and surveillance.  Indeed, like other Coen Brothers films, there is a static, vertical quality to narrative, rather than a horizontal dramatic arc, and there is very little pushback against Bardem, which would have added dramatic intensity.  Thus, though this is chilling and gruesome in a quietly sadistic way, it's not terribly dramatically fulfilling.  And the film resolves on an  unsatisfactory note.  The Coen Brothers cannot be fully faulted for the gaps in the narrative -- the film follows Cormac McCarthy's novel quite closely.  Indeed, most of the dialogue is lifted directly from the novel.  It leads you to wonder whether McCarthy was imitating the dialogue of Horton Foote, whose homespun, folksy, repetitive nature it very much resembles, or if the Coen Brothers might have been imitating McCarthy's dialogue in a number of their films.  Both film and novel leave huge gaps in the narrative, and the relationships of the characters to each other in space and time are never fully realized. It can be difficult and confusing at times to try to follow.  Tommy Lee Jones portrays a sheriff who doesn't do much throughout the film but offer occasional small talk and a nihilistic, fatalistic viewpoint on life.  He barely figures into the story, with halfhearted attempts to track the killer.  And his chitchat toward the end of the film is a weak attempt to underscore Bardem's flip-a-coin, haphazard, aw shucks it's all inevitable view of human existence.  The Coen Brothers have done a craftsmanlike job of following the book and crafting a movie, but the gaps in both movie and book are too great.  The characters are one-dimensional, and their motivation is underwritten.",4,"More quietly sadistic bloodshed based on nihilistic, empty book by Cormac McCarthy",1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,2575,"['Typical', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'films', 'static', 'studied', 'quality', 'frame', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'homespun', 'talk', 'sinister', 'gruesome', 'bloodshed', 'observed', 'cool', 'chilling', 'manner', 'instance', 'gaps', 'story', 'continuity', 'exposition', 'underwritten', 'leaving', 'shred', 'backstory', 'Bardem', 'character', 'drug', 'deal', 'bad', 'desert', 'leaving', 'bloodshed', 'bodies', 'drugs', 'satchel', 'drug', 'money', 'wake', 'money', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'chances', 'upon', 'appropriates', 'psychopathic', 'murderer', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'played', 'Bardem', 'soon', 'path', 'pursuit', 'money', 'killing', 'everyone', 'way', 'how', 'exactly', 'able', 'track', 'Brolin', 'right', 'gate', 'just', 'turn', 'never', 'adequately', 'explained', 'Even', 'transponder', 'signal', 'coming', 'drug', 'satchel', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'kind', 'close', 'tracking', 'surveillance', 'Indeed', 'other', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'films', 'static', 'vertical', 'quality', 'narrative', 'rather', 'horizontal', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'very', 'little', 'pushback', 'Bardem', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'Thus', 'chilling', 'gruesome', 'quietly', 'sadistic', 'way', 'not', 'terribly', 'dramatically', 'fulfilling', 'film', 'unsatisfactory', 'note', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'fully', 'faulted', 'gaps', 'narrative', 'film', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'novel', 'quite', 'closely', 'Indeed', 'most', 'dialogue', 'lifted', 'directly', 'novel', 'wonder', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'imitating', 'dialogue', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'homespun', 'folksy', 'repetitive', 'nature', 'very', 'much', 'resembles', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'imitating', 'McCarthy', 'dialogue', 'number', 'films', 'film', 'novel', 'leave', 'huge', 'gaps', 'narrative', 'relationships', 'characters', 'other', 'space', 'time', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'realized', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'confusing', 'times', 'try', 'follow', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'sheriff', 'who', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'film', 'offer', 'occasional', 'small', 'talk', 'nihilistic', 'fatalistic', 'viewpoint', 'life', 'barely', 'story', 'halfhearted', 'attempts', 'track', 'killer', 'chitchat', 'end', 'film', 'weak', 'attempt', 'underscore', 'Bardem', 'flip-a-coin', 'haphazard', 'aw', 'shucks', 'inevitable', 'view', 'human', 'existence', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'done', 'craftsmanlike', 'job', 'following', 'book', 'crafting', 'movie', 'gaps', 'movie', 'book', 'are', 'too', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'motivation', 'underwritten']",N/A

I am no fan of gratuitous violence or inconclusive messages, so it surprised me that I loved this movie so much.  After reading many reviews and comments on Amazon, I agreed with some of the negative points people made about the film.  But they didn't change my mind.This is because No Country for Old Men succeeds in embodying fear.  Bad-guy Anton is the most frightening figure since Hannibal Lecter.  Why?  Because he is intelligent and on a soul-less mission to kill.  Again: this alone does not make a film good - not by a long shot.  Yet as opposed to other figures in murderous-rampage cinema (take Natural Born Killers, which claims to have a ""message""), this character's made to look plain and ugly, and is no shining beacon of Hollywood that we secretly sympathize with because we know him from other, gentler roles.  At least for the American movie scene, Bardem comes out of nowhere, and that helps make his character alien and unlikeable, and us feel uncomfortable and disturbed in his on-screen presence.Anton and his mission, seen in the context of the film - the dawn of the drug war - brings me back to the character embodying fear.  How many drug-related deaths have we seen in the States in the last decades?  How many innocent people have lost their lives, or survived, by pure (or bad) luck, like the toss of a coin?  Anton embodies (the fear of) this randomness.  It's ugly and scary, it comes and disappears, worst of all never answering the question ""why"".  That, to me, is the crowning achievement of the story. Putting that on the big screen is indeed amazing and is, among other reasons, why I am so floored by the film.If you decide to see No Country for Old Men, don't do it because of the hype about the Coen brothers, the awards, or my commentary.  This film means something different to everyone, and you may say it's just a waste of time.  Or you may end up agreeing with me that it's a masterpiece.

85323,AAOF195P95ZVC,0788882988,Ross E. Nelson,"[3, 5]","It was tough choosing four stars over three for this movie--it was very well acted, with Bardem (Chigurh) playing a principled (in a grotesque way), extremely creepy hit man, Brolin the unprincipled knucklehead who discovers the drug deal shootout and later returns to the scene (to his undoing), and Jones as the sheriff mystified and appalled at this kind of remorseless slaughter in his territory.On the other hand, there's an element of unreality here.  How does Chigurh, the assassin, go about repeatedly in public carrying a shotgun with a silencer and no one notices?  He gets the drop on the Woody Harrelson character, who is also a bad guy but allegedly very competent, in an unbelievable scene.  The street shoot-out at night between Moss (Brolin) and Chigurh attracts zero notice from residents, cops, even dogs.  Now there's a sleepy town.There's also a scene I didn't understand.  The Mexicans involved in the original drug deal gone bad finally catch up to Moss and kill him.  Later that night Jones (Sheriff Bell) returns to the scene of the crime and finds the door lock punched out, which is a Chigurh calling card.  So Chigurh was there--before the hit, after the hit, during the hit?  He's shown hiding in the dark with only a lock-sized hole of light illuminating his position, presumably in Moss's motel room, yet the sheriff doesn't find him.  What was going on?The movie ends with the sheriff recounting a dream he had of his dead father.  In an area of dark and cold his father rides his horse by him and sets up a campfire in the dark that his son, the sheriff, can ride to eventually and be warmed.  It's actually a moving story, at once melancholy and reassuring, but what is its connection to the movie's events?The war on drugs had, by the early 1980s in which ""No Country"" is set, created the kind of profits that turned some men into conscienceless killing machines.  America was being turned into a country not suited for old men, old men who were used to dealing with somewhat rational old-time criminals, not the mass-murdering new breed who killed almost as a reflex.  This point comes out a couple of times in conversations between the sheriff and some old buddies.This is a strange, violent, and at times moving film about a changing America.  Best picture of the year?  I'm not convinced.  But it sticks with you.

85326,A387BD735MI50R,0788882988,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","The slow, self-assured menace of Javier Bardem's character is riveting to watch. However, since so much of this movie depends on the tension created by Bardem's terrifying, toying deliberation, you might be a little disappointed by what seems to be some unwarranted hastening of the action in certain places. It feels as if a number of scenes were left on the cutting room floor - scenes that we want to see, that we are primed to see by the overall pacing of the movie.For example, there is the scene that was so often used to advertise this movie - the scene in which Bardem's character engages a convenience storeowner in what we clearly perceive is a life-or-death coin toss. When Bardem mockingly calls the storeowner ""Friendo"" and commands him to call heads or tails, we feel that something in particular triggered Bardem's animosity, that the storeowner himself might have presumptively addressed Bardem as ""Friendo."" However we don't see any of what might have led to the showdown. The scene is pretty much limited to just the action shown in the advertising trailer.If one of the reasons we watch thrillers, outside of pure vicarious enjoyment of violence, is to rehearse what we ourselves might do if confronted by extreme threats - then it's important to see the whole development of the threat.One other quibble: the plot's logic fails on a key point. Bardem's character proves to be such an implacable, unerring juggernaut in tracking down whoever stole his drug consignment, we wonder how he so easily lost track of the drug package in the first place.However these minor points aside, ""No Country"" is an absolutely engrossing trip - taken once. When I went to watch it through a second time though, I found I wasn't nearly as involved. I did appreciate having another chance to get to know Tommy Lee Jones' character, with his wonderful, heroic resign. But Bardem's Chigurh character didn't seem as interesting the second time around. Whereas I can watch other Coen Brother's classics such as ""Fargo"" and ""Blood Simple"" any number of times and always find some new fascination with them - this movie didn't seem complex enough to hold up that way.In summary, this is a great movie to rent, but it might not be worth adding to your permanent collection.",4,Riveting to Rent,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,2267,"['slow', 'self-assured', 'menace', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'character', 'riveting', 'watch', 'However', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'tension', 'created', 'Bardem', 'terrifying', 'toying', 'deliberation', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'disappointed', 'what', 'be', 'unwarranted', 'hastening', 'action', 'certain', 'places', 'number', 'scenes', 'were', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'scenes', 'want', 'see', 'are', 'primed', 'see', 'overall', 'pacing', 'movie.For', 'example', 'scene', 'was', 'so', 'often', 'used', 'advertise', 'movie', 'scene', 'Bardem', 'character', 'convenience', 'storeowner', 'what', 'clearly', 'perceive', 'life-or-death', 'coin', 'toss', 'When', 'Bardem', 'mockingly', 'storeowner', 'Friendo', 'call', 'heads', 'tails', 'feel', 'something', 'particular', 'triggered', 'Bardem', 'animosity', 'storeowner', 'might', 'have', 'presumptively', 'addressed', 'Bardem', 'Friendo', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'led', 'showdown', 'scene', 'pretty', 'much', 'limited', 'just', 'action', 'shown', 'advertising', 'one', 'reasons', 'watch', 'thrillers', 'pure', 'vicarious', 'enjoyment', 'violence', 'rehearse', 'what', 'might', 'do', 'confronted', 'extreme', 'threats', 'then', 'important', 'see', 'whole', 'development', 'threat.One', 'other', 'quibble', 'plot', 'logic', 'key', 'point', 'Bardem', 'character', 'be', 'such', 'implacable', 'unerring', 'juggernaut', 'tracking', 'down', 'whoever', 'stole', 'drug', 'consignment', 'wonder', 'how', 'so', 'easily', 'lost', 'track', 'drug', 'package', 'first', 'place.However', 'minor', 'points', 'aside', 'Country', 'absolutely', 'engrossing', 'trip', 'taken', 'once', 'When', 'went', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'found', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'involved', 'did', 'appreciate', 'having', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'character', 'wonderful', 'heroic', 'resign', 'Bardem', 'Chigurh', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'interesting', 'second', 'time', 'can', 'watch', 'other', 'Coen', 'Brother', 'classics', 'such', 'Fargo', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'number', 'times', 'always', 'find', 'new', 'fascination', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'complex', 'enough', 'hold', 'up', 'way.In', 'summary', 'great', 'movie', 'rent', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'worth', 'adding', 'permanent', 'collection']",N/A

It's a well made movie in terms of production value, acting, and direction. But ultimately, it is nothing more than a stylized slasher flick including the obligatory weapon gimmickry. It pretends to be social commentary about the problems with drug trafficking. But it fails to be convincing because the characters are so incredulous, especially the villain. The plot is also ridiculously unbelievable. With $2 million of ill-gotten gain, wouldn't you be flying off somewhere?! Some aspects of the movie was difficult to follow due to the Texas accent. Having seen the movie, I really wasn't even sure who Chigurh was, or the character portrayed by Woody Harrelson, and where they came from. Or what the point of the role of the sheriff was.

This movie is an instant classic, and without giving the ending away, the ending fits in perfectly with the rest of the film.  All the actors in the movie do a great job but it's Javier Bardem who stands out here.  He is by far the best pshycopath in my opinion since Kevin Spacey in ""Seven"".  As you watch Bardem's character, Anton Chigur, one can't help but see absolutely nothing in him.  He's a person who does not care, and everything about him isn't real.  Even when he smiles, it's sort of a disturbing smile, because as you look at it, it's one of the fakest smiles you'll ever see.  There's nothing behind this smile at all, no real feelings, no care at all.  The only true thing on Chigur's mind is violence.  Tommy Lee Jones is also great in this movie playing an aging sheriff whose seeing the types of criminals he deals with change drastically.  Josh Brolin is also great playing Llewelyn Moss who may not seem like the smartest character at first, but the more you get to know him, the more you realize that he's not really dumb, he's just a person who got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  All the other supporting players in this movie are great as well.  The sound editing in this film is also great, and the best example I can give for this is the scene inside of the hotel where Anton is on one side of the door and Moss is on the other side.  There's no music over the top to build the tension, but just by the subtle sounds of footsteps, lights flickering, the tension is at an all time high.  This is a great movie, the Coen brothers deserve all the accolades they recieve, best movie of 2007.",5,What a Movie,1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,1751,"['truly', 'believe', 'majority', 'people', 'are', 'giving', 'film', 'negative', 'review', 'are', 'doing', 'so', 'based', 'ending', 'movie', 'instant', 'classic', 'giving', 'ending', 'away', 'ending', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'rest', 'film', 'actors', 'movie', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'out', 'here', 'far', 'best', 'pshycopath', 'opinion', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Seven', 'watch', 'Bardem', 'character', 'Anton', 'Chigur', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'see', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'care', 'everything', ""n't"", 'real', 'Even', 'when', 'sort', 'disturbing', 'smile', 'look', 'one', 'fakest', 'smiles', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'nothing', 'smile', 'real', 'feelings', 'care', 'only', 'true', 'thing', 'Chigur', 'mind', 'violence', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'also', 'great', 'movie', 'playing', 'aging', 'sheriff', 'seeing', 'types', 'criminals', 'change', 'drastically', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'also', 'great', 'playing', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'smartest', 'character', 'first', 'more', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'realize', 'not', 'really', 'dumb', 'just', 'person', 'who', 'got', 'caught', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'other', 'supporting', 'players', 'movie', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'sound', 'editing', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'best', 'example', 'can', 'give', 'scene', 'hotel', 'where', 'Anton', 'one', 'side', 'door', 'Moss', 'other', 'side', 'music', 'top', 'build', 'tension', 'just', 'subtle', 'sounds', 'footsteps', 'lights', 'flickering', 'tension', 'time', 'high', 'great', 'movie', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'deserve', 'accolades', 'recieve', 'best', 'movie', '2007']",N/A
85329,A37S3ACL57LN62,0788882988,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[5, 8]","Javier Bardem (Anton Chigurh) is a cold blooded killer who totes an oxygen tank to quickly kill his victims. He kills without mercy for seemingly no reason at all other than he enjoys this pastime. An innocent man named Lynn (Josh Brolin) gets mixed up in his twisted pleasures when he accidentally comes across a large murder scene. There are dead men and bullet holes everywhere all in the name of a drug deal gone bad. Lynn knows the money has to be close, and with rising greed discovers the man who absconded with the suitcase. He takes it home, knowing he is now doomed, and begins a fateful attempt to run away from Javier's bloodlust and search for redemption.You might notice that I didn't mention Tommy Lee Jones at all, and for good reason. His scenes are utterly forgettable and serve as a lame attempt to make the violent events in the movie somehow poetic and bigger than the dealings of crime. A scene near the end with a former cop is the culmination of this big-headedness.This film is terribly overrated. Sure, it is entertaining and sure the actors worked hard. Sure, the lighting was used well, but this film leaves you with nothing after you see it except the question of why it won best picture. Perhaps it won simply because the other nominees weren't stellar either. Either way, this film will hardly be talked about for years to come.",3,"""What do we circulate?

85330,A6FIAB28IS79,0788882988,Samuel Chell,"[3, 7]","Poetry fans tend to make much of the original source of the the title--W. B. Yeats' ""Sailing to Byzantium,"" in which the aging narrator wishes to exchange his hard life in Ireland (""that country"") for an imaginary aesthetic existence in ancient Byzantium, with its mosaic temples and golden sculptures.  But neither the novelist (Cormac McCarthy) nor the Coen brothers are promising any sort of deliverance through poetry, art or any other imagined alternative to mortal existence.  This isn't a story for elitist intellectuals and interpreters of Yeats' frequently arcane visions (some of my students even find the poem downright ""wacky"").  On the other hand, the movie is not merely a story for those in need of a couple of hours of escape (though I frankly found the basic plot and characters so entertaining I was hanging on to my seat with white knuckles to the very end).But the story is the Coen brothers' ""bait"" to get the viewer to think about non-trivial matters.  After all, it's only we humans who are blessed with ""self-consciousness""-- with the capacity to think about our individual ""identities,"" and even about our own life and death (though the beauty of good movies is that further inquiry into ""deep meanings"" is an option, not a requirement).  Personally, I choose to take the bait and the next step: what's the point of the story?  what's the ""meaning"" of what we've just seen?  After some (not much) deliberation, I'd offer the following ""translation"" of the title (sorry about the wordiness): the older we get in this finite, temporary world, the more conscious we become of our mortality and death.  Some of us pretend we can beat it; most of us see it as irrational and unfair; practically all of us avoid or at least postpone thoughts about the subject, instead preferring to wait around and see what happens.Tommy Lee Jones says toward the end of the story that he's quitting as sheriff.  He had expected ""God to somehow come into his life"" but is now too fully aware that God (much less he himself) is over-matched.  The film's nemesis is a merciless ""executioner"" with less conscience than The Terminator and sufficient inscrutability to make even Woody Harrelson's perceptive diagnosis of him (as a psychopathic killer with principles, albeit devoid of ""morality"") inadequate.  In short, the film is a version of an Ingmar Bergman film like ""Through a Glass Darkly"" or an earlier, better-known film like Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal""--the primary difference being that the Coen Brothers' filmic and narrating style is more apt to catch the attention of a larger, ""non-academic"" audience.  It's doubtful many of those who see the film will be satisfied with the conclusion.  In fact, there is no closure, thus breaking an unwritten rule of all cinema.  Recall how Hitchock has a shrink appear at the end of ""Psycho"" to explain in logical terms the character of Norman Bates (and practically everything we've just seen).  When the 1919 German expressionistic film, ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" played before American audiences, an actor was hired to appear on stage at the end of the movie to assure us that the monstrous killer-psychopath was now completely cured (no need to worry about guys like Hitler).  And so we would all like to believe--about extended life-spans, the ""cures"" of medicine, the progress of science.  But the older you get--and the more inquisitive--the more you realize that the advertisers-promoters-money-hungry pharmaceutical companies, cosmetic surgeons, ""powerful"" positive thinkers--have sold us all a bill of goods.  Like the characters in the film, they're as likely as us not to know what's going to happen next, pretending that life is an open and free proposition and that we could be one of the ""lucky ones,"" awaiting the equivalent of personal fame and fortune if not immortality.Josh Brolin appears to be the sympathetic ""hero""--flawed by greed and, like the characters of ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" making what could be a fatal mistake.  Yet he has a John Wayne-like rugged individualism, a knack for survival, and commands instant respect from those around him once they learn of his service in ""Nam""--but that won't get you diddly in the relentless, fatalistic, flip-of-a-coin determinism that, in the Coen Brothers' view of modern existence, controls our lives.  Brolin's conscience requires him to return to the scene of a crime with water for the survivor of a drug deal gone terribly bad, yet he can dismiss his wife's concerns for her mother. And in this instance we as the audience can afford to dismiss them as well.  By this time we're conditioned to expect such  a remark to be followed by the Executioner's (Javier Bardem--looking like a smaller but more chilling version of Schwarznegger or Andre the Giant) quick extermination of the person so named via his powerful weapon with its menacing silencer.  But that would follow a certain pattern of logic--instead she dies of cancer.  And when our leading contender for hero is momentarily distracted by a sunbathing babe in long shot, there's no need any longer to even play out the execution. We see a dead body floating in the motel's pool (motels outnumber ""homes"" by a considerable margin in this movie--as mortal beings, we're all ""transients,"" whether we know it or not, whether we've paid a mortage or not.Brolin's wife suddenly becomes a central figure, but only briefly.  She at least has no illusions about getting a lucky roll of the dice.  Her fate, like that of all mortals, is preordained, and she refuses to play the Executioner's coin-flip game, calling it more accurately: ""It's not me or the coin that decides what happens to me.  It's you.""  But in this circular question about free will and the meaning of life, Bardem answers her back: ""You're wrong.  That's how I got here.""  In other words, each of us could not have been born had the slightest circumstance been changed on the night (or whenever) we were conceived.  And who knows why we were born as human beings and not cats?  It's all a game of chance, and there isn't even an authentic card dealer. (The viewer can only speculate why the Executioner sees his own dicy birth as license to reverse the process--serving as the agent of hastening death for all.  Is he sparing his victims Kierkegaard's characterization of mortality as a ""sickness onto death""--a charitable interpretation, yet his actions practically resist characterization as ""evil"" due to their irreversible and mechanical necessity).  But its through this mysterious (and deadly) character that the movie destroys all of our illusions and ultimately goes after the worst of the deadly sins--about which, even after the Bible and all the world's important literature and religions, we lack awareness: pride, hubris, taking upon ourselves what belongs only to God.  When will we learn?  Why can't we?  Why must we be so prideful in the face of more violence, terrorism, and destruction?But therein lies the film's admission of Aristotle's ""fatal flaw"" and along with it the small ray of light in the film (along with some moments of humor, which even the critics seem to have missed).  Brolin, after all, did make a mistake and had the arrogance to think he could get away with his theft of the drug money intended for someone else.  And for a moment, he let carnal desire distract him from the real threat.  Moreover, he took his own life more seriously than that of his wife or mother-in-law, by assuming that the Nemesis-Executioner was interested ""only"" in him!  But you simply can't take for granted the next move of this Executioner, who passes up an opportunity to snuff out the sheriff, Tommy Lee Jones (the closest thing to an authentic hero). Not being detected could be a motive, but is it possible he senses in the sheriff greater realism and honesty than in any of the other characters?The last two scenes do nothing to prepare the spectator for an end, but they do practically ""require"" interpretation (witness the complaints from the numerous reviewers who trash the entire film because it doesn't end as they might like).  I like happy endings, and I'm frequently impatient when things don't go my way, but I'm afraid that in this story, especially, those viewers who simply refuse to discuss, think about, or interpret a disturbing moment (or even a fictional movie!) are told  to shape up or ship out. The Executioner (quite vulnerable himself, by the way, but a better survivor than Harrelson or Brolin) walks away.  Behind him he leaves the seeds of greed (and of fatal pride) in a young boy who took money (from the Nemesis, naturally) in exchange for what began as a Good Samaritan act.  Next on the agenda of the recovered Executioner, who ambles off into a typical American neighborhood (like that in David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"") who knows what or whom?--the sheriff?  His are the last words as he reports a dream about meeting his father (who did not die an old man), and then says: ""I woke up.""  That awakening is what this movie is all about. The screen goes black waiting for the spectator's inner light to come on.  It's time to wake up--perhaps now more than ever.  There may be a future, but there will be no lottery tickets--even to those who win them.  It's we who must act to make the best of that mortally-defined fateful span of existence that lies before us.  We can't know if our efforts will bear positive fruit, but we can know that ""good"" isn't simply going to happen by wishing and waiting for it.  And we can also know that our prideful moments can only bring more misery.  And if we don't know this now, the storyteller seems to be saying, we most certainly will either know it, or feel the effect, when we're older.But this may too rigid, or unforgiving, an interpretation. Thinkers like Kierkegaard, Tillich, O'Connor, Ingmar Bergman had no illusions about the lack of theological curiosity residing in human beings.  Yet they also accepted Socrates' insistence that ""the unexamined life is unfit to be lived,"" knowing that fatal pride is born of presumptuous ignorance, not of open inquiry).  Created with the unique ability to question, to examine, and to know, humans often appear practically eager to forfeit this ""gift"" (we can be thankful most of the world's great religions make room for a God of grace--a Deity extending love to those who may not have the opportunity for rigorous examining of one's self and surroundings).For those who prefer a less theological interpretation, the emphasis on ""land"" in the title provides it.  Why would the storyteller select as a setting for this parable about modern-day America a vast, open, dry and sterile wasteland?  Reminiscent of T. S. Eliot's modernist poem ""The Wasteland"" or Italian film director Michelangelo Antonioni's critique of present-day America (""Zabriskie Point""), the setting repeatedly points to a vacuum, a void, a land laid waste by the same human beings it once nurtured and empowered.  Everyone wants answers.  We have the power to find them, but only if we're not too complacent or proud to search for them.",5,"Like life itself, there is no ""rapture"" (though the Coen brothers have not abandoned all

Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, this existential modern-day western features knockout performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem (a classic villain despite the Beatle haircut). Though excessively violent, the movie provides a disturbing meditation on uncompromised evil within its cat-and-mouse framework. When the Coens go full throttle, the results are exhilarating. However, Joel and Ethan occasionally stumble in their over-faithfulness to McCarthy's source material. Another misstep is the needless subplot involving Woody Harrelson's sharp-dressed bounty hunter. Kelly Macdonald, on the other hand, makes the most of her limited screen time as Brolin's devoted wife.

It racked up awards, ultimately winning Best Picture at the Academy Awards, among other Oscars. I did not see it until February 2008, when in arrived in theatres on Prince Edward Island.The film functions on two levels: the first is as a pure thriller, and on that level it is an all-but-unqualified success.  The Coens are tremendous filmmakers on a technical level, and so they are able to conjure up a series of stunningly tense set-pieces, pitting various characters against Javier Bardem's stone-cold killer Anton Chigurh.  One, particularly, is brilliant: Josh Brolin's character, Llewelyn Mars, sits in his motel room, having found the tracking device placed on his person, and listens as the ominous beeping of the tracking device (which the audience has previously observed in action) approaches: the audience is on pins and needles.  A great thriller needs a great villain, and Chigurh is as good a filmic foe as I have seen in many years.  He is determined, and his ability to continually keep on the trail of his opponents and absorb pan is almost Schwarzeneggerian.  The Coens supply him with some grisly signature weapons as well, from a nasty-looking gun to the prominent air-fired cattlegun.  Bardem's performance is quite intimidating.  Elsewhere, Josh Brolin and Kelly Macdonald are strong as as his most prominent targets (the latter has a particularly fine scene right at the end).Then there is the second level, that of a more existential drama, and on that level I am less certain.  There are issues of fate, chance, and the like in play here, and the nature of evil (incarnated in Chigurh), and none are really resolved, or, as far as I can see, amount to much.  The title refers to Tommy Lee Jones' character's belief that the world is becoming less and less civilized as time passes.  However, the movie welcomely bucks this, as Jones' elderly uncle relates that the world has always been a cruel and hard place, and criticizes his 'vanity' at thinking he could really change it.  The end is inconclusive, and I could tell that many of the audience in the theatre were not satisfied by the movie's climax (which basically avoids anything climactic).  Thematically, the ""evil wins"" motif is rather banal.This is a gripping film experience most of the way through, but the ending does not work as the ending of a thriller, and I never found the other themes particularly well-developed; ultimately, I give it three stars; as a thriller, it probably rates as at least a four; as an existential story, I'd lean towards 2.",3,"For most of it's length, a strong thriller, but hobbled by a divisive ending.",1218844800,"08 16, 2008",2008,2736,"['Coen', 'Brothers', 'decade', 'middling', 'productions', 'following', 'highly', 'overrated', 'opinion', 'Fargo', 'hit', 'major', 'success', '2007', 'adaptation', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'novel', 'racked', 'up', 'awards', 'ultimately', 'winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'other', 'Oscars', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'February', '2008', 'when', 'arrived', 'theatres', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island.The', 'film', 'functions', 'two', 'levels', 'first', 'pure', 'thriller', 'level', 'all-but-unqualified', 'success', 'Coens', 'are', 'tremendous', 'filmmakers', 'technical', 'level', 'so', 'are', 'able', 'conjure', 'up', 'series', 'stunningly', 'tense', 'set-pieces', 'pitting', 'various', 'characters', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'stone-cold', 'killer', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'One', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'character', 'Llewelyn', 'Mars', 'motel', 'room', 'having', 'found', 'tracking', 'device', 'placed', 'person', 'ominous', 'beeping', 'tracking', 'device', 'audience', 'previously', 'observed', 'action', 'audience', 'pins', 'needles', 'great', 'thriller', 'great', 'villain', 'Chigurh', 'as', 'good', 'filmic', 'foe', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'determined', 'ability', 'continually', 'keep', 'trail', 'opponents', 'absorb', 'pan', 'almost', 'Schwarzeneggerian', 'Coens', 'supply', 'grisly', 'signature', 'weapons', 'as', 'well', 'nasty-looking', 'gun', 'prominent', 'air-fired', 'cattlegun', 'Bardem', 'performance', 'quite', 'intimidating', 'Elsewhere', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'are', 'strong', 'most', 'prominent', 'targets', 'latter', 'particularly', 'fine', 'scene', 'right', 'end', '.Then', 'second', 'level', 'more', 'existential', 'drama', 'level', 'am', 'less', 'certain', 'are', 'issues', 'fate', 'chance', 'like', 'play', 'here', 'nature', 'evil', 'incarnated', 'Chigurh', 'none', 'are', 'really', 'resolved', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'amount', 'much', 'title', 'refers', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'character', 'belief', 'world', 'becoming', 'less', 'less', 'civilized', 'time', 'passes', 'However', 'movie', 'welcomely', 'Jones', 'elderly', 'uncle', 'world', 'always', 'been', 'cruel', 'hard', 'place', ""'vanity"", 'thinking', 'could', 'really', 'change', 'end', 'inconclusive', 'could', 'tell', 'many', 'audience', 'theatre', 'were', 'not', 'satisfied', 'movie', 'climax', 'basically', 'anything', 'climactic', 'Thematically', 'evil', 'wins', 'motif', 'rather', 'banal.This', 'gripping', 'film', 'experience', 'most', 'way', 'ending', 'not', 'work', 'ending', 'thriller', 'never', 'found', 'other', 'themes', 'particularly', 'well-developed', 'ultimately', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'thriller', 'probably', 'rates', 'least', 'four', 'existential', 'story', ""'d"", 'lean', 'towards', '2']",N/A

It is so good, in fact - so well-directed, written and acted - that it can survive a plot that actually doesn't quite make sense. I am still unsure about some things, but that doesn't matter, because it is film about character, not about telling a story.**SPOILER WARNING**Of course, the film can be interpreted multiple ways, but I was reminded of Heraclitus' maxim ""A man's character is his fate."" Each person in the movie (although they may act as though chance has driven them forward and they do not know what the future holds) actually creates their own fate by the decisions they cannot help but make, that their character dictates.For example, despite Chigurh's aleatory ritual, his peculiarly principled character is what determines his actions, not the flip of a coin. As Mrs. Moss says ""The coin has no say,"" only Chigurh himself. At some point, the money no longer matters to Llewellyn Moss, if it ever did; he simply becomes intent on self-preservation and the defense of his wife. His character - his strong-willed determination to win and to do it alone- creates his fate. And I just want to say I loved the ending - Tommy Lee Jones' recounting of two dreams reminded me of Bergman's ""Shame."" His dreams, of course, illustrate his own character and his decisions.I don't want to give away any more of the movie, but like all great films, this is one that stays with you and that you think about for days.

If it is, then so is this brilliant film version. What the Coen brothers have done here is make a film that is completely different from mainstream Hollywood, and so far above the mainstream in terms of quality that it makes you wonder how Hollywood manages to survive with some of the rubbish it produces. There is no comparison you can make with mainstream Hollywood. Really you have to look to European cinema to find films made in the similar style.It revolves around a drugs deal that goes wrong, and mainly follows two characters: Moss who finds the money associated with the deal and the other man wants it back. The second man is psychopathic killer called Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who in his relentless pursuit kills anything and anyone who gets in his way. Sometimes this is just for fun and he tosses a coin to decide the victims fate. Another unusual aspect of this killer, is the main weapon he uses which is a cattle gun which is fired by compressed air. Not the most convenient of weapons but very effective. In pursuit of both men is Sheriff Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones. He is really out of his depth. The title of the film is a direct reference to him as far as I can make out.The Coen brothers film all this in their unique style, with their slightly odd take on the world. However unlike probably all their previous films, this one does not contain much, if any elements of black comedy. Another very unusual aspect to this film is the almost complete absence of a music soundtrack in the film. All the more surprising then when at one point in the film Moss wakes up to find a group of Mexican singers serenading him.In terms of their previous films this is closest to Blood Simple, but its a much better film than their debut.

""No country"" follows the strange odyssey of Liewelyn Moss(Josh Boldin) a grizzly Nam vet who stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong out in the middle of the Texas desert. Lievelyn soon discovers a briefcase with a cool two mill and decides to keep it for himself. Unfortunately he gets the attention of numerous people including the psychopathic killer/ex special opps agent Chigurh(Javier Bardem). Chigurh is a chilling killer that likes to use a cattle gun to punch in padlocks and occasionally a hole into a victims head. What makes Chigurh so chilling is that he's not after Liewelyn for the money because he works ""beyond money or drugs, he follows his own principals"" which seem to change at the flip of a coin. He's hunting Liewelyn for the thrill of the hunt and the joy of the kill. Liewelyn decides to play Chigurh's game but puts his and his young wife' life on the line in the process. Enter Sheriff Bill (Tommy Lee Jones)a old timey Sheriff who befriends Liewelyn's wife and decides to take it upon himself to talk Liewelyn out of his foolish crusade and at the same time stop the sadistic Chigurh from claiming another life. I throughly enjoy ""No Country"" even though it was an ultra-violent film that offered no ray of hope. The acting was superb across the board with Bardem stealing the show with his portrayl of Chigurh. Through it's bleakness ""No Country"" is filled with dark comedy and even though some if it is wrong you still find yourself laughing.

That--in my book--is a collapse.It's almost like the Coen brothers found something better to do after making 3/4 of the film then rushed through the last 30 minutes. Anyone seeing the movie will know the exact moment that I'm referring to; it's the scene where Josh Brolin gets into a brief flirtatious conversation with a woman at a motel pool.The movie is absolutely brilliant up until the aforementioned point. You have a hunter (Brolin) that becomes hunted after stumbling upon a lot of money from what is apparently a very big drug deal gone wrong. The owners of the money hire a ruthless killer (Javier Bardem) to track down the hunter, and a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to put it all together.During the first 90 minutes you'll be on the edge of your seat while detail after detail is played out in a cat and mouse thriller that gives the perspective of the hunter and the hunted. You'll be thoroughly entertained. You'll be shocked. You'll be engrossed. Then comes the pool scene which is the start of the antithesis of all of the adjectives that I just used.The last 30 minutes seem forced together...rushed. It's not that the movie ends too abruptly; it's that the detail that was included in the first 90 minutes goes out the window. The movie just gets odd.So I'm very surprised at all of the unwavering praise, acclaim and awards that have been thrown at No Country for Old Men.

Naimpally ""avid music and movie fan""","[0, 2]","No Country for Old Men is a very stylistic action movie done by the Coen brothers, who also did Fargo and other off-beat noir movies.  Josh Brolin plays a man, Llewelyn, who is basically good who stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad and finds two million dollars.  After he takes the money, Llewelyn is pursued by a bad man, Anton, played by Javier Bardem, in an Oscar winning performance.  Anton is a cold blooded killer who spends most of the movie tracking down Llewelyn in order to recover the money and leaves in his wake a slew of dead bodies.The characters are interesting, but there is very little character development.  Anton likes to kill almost everyone he encounters, but we don't know why he became this way.  Sometimes Anton tosses a coin and offers his victims a 50:50 chance at saving their life by asking them to call the coin toss.  However, in the movie, we never find out why he is a cold blooded killer or why he likes to use the coin toss to determine whether or not to kill someone.  We don't know how Anton was trained or what his background is.  In fact, there is very little background provided for the different characters, which is a real shame, because I wanted to know more about the characters.  Instead, the film is non-stop violence and is more like the Terminator than Fargo.  In Fargo, we knew why people were doing what they were doing, while in Old Country, motivation is completely ignored.Despite the negatives, this film is worth seeing for the excellent performances turned in by the lead actors, and for the stylistic atmosphere it creates.

85353,A38X3820MO0TAN,0788882988,Sony XL,"[3, 3]","No Country for Old Men is as exceptional a mix of two creative talents- the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen, and author Cormac McCarthy (recent winner of the Pulitzer for The Road, his own masterpiece) as one could imagine, as they converge on a story that in lessor hands would be just a B movie. The story concerns an average Joe out hunting one day in Texas who comes across a bunch of dead bodies, heroin, and a satchel with 2 million in cash. He takes it, but without knowing that a true embodiment of a psychopath (Javier Bardem) is on his trail, and as he evades him it becomes more and more clear the fatalism that lies in store, as a weathered sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) is also on the trail with perpetulally sad eyes looking on from his stolid demeanor.More than this, it's also about as good a morality play as one could ask for, because it plays and tools and makes very serious questions about what is moral, or what isn't, or what is so ambiguous that it's all up to the toss of a coin or a chance ride out of town. There are a few interpretations to Bardem's character Anton that could be taken, but one thing is certain- he's less a symbol than a real presence, a ""ghost"" as Jones's sheriff calls him that can come around at the drop of a pin, usually in the dark, and strike the utmost fear (or confusion if you're a clerk) in the hearts of men and women. You'll never look at a coin toss the same way again. Or an air-gun. Or fixing a bullet wound in a leg. Or a hunt at a motel. Or even the aftermath of a car crash.But at the same time it's the purest time of cinema, recalling Hitchcock and Leone and Welles's Touch of Evil and the best of noir and westerns. There are so many exceptional shots and lighting, so much depth to the perception of the characters through the mis-en-scene, so much tension, that through this it's all up to the actors to make or break the near-perfection that is the McCarthy source. Bardem embodies Anton like no other could- you can't look at his eyes, often steel-cold and horrifically professional (to what professional who can say), which occasional tear- and it's obviously worthy of an Oscar. And Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are also fantastic; we see Brolin often in the midst of an action scene, a moment of 'save-your-life' going on, and one can finally see an actor of his caliber completely breaking out in a role that doesn't require him to ever totally ""emote"". Jones, on the other hand, gives a compassionate turn in a film that's about the struggles of desperate men in a land without law and order. He's gone through so much that it comes out completely in his voice and eyes, sorrowful but holding back, and he reaches a level of connection with the character that makes the Fugitive look like simpleton TV. Kelly McDonald, who plays Lleland's wife, is also excellent when called upon, especially in a crucial scene later in the film.It's gut-wrenching, bleak, violent, super-tense (I clenched many a knuckle during some scenes), surprisingly funny in a darkly comic manner not seen by the Coens in many years, and artistically fashioned to a beat that is meditative (watch the opening moments with Jones's voice-over), simple, and doomed. It's beautiful and terribly tragic, for McCarthy fans it finally strikes at what is truest to his material- even if you haven't read the book itself the Road will give an indication of the mood and atmosphere at hand- and at the moment I can't think of any other film that would be the best pick of the year- maybe one of the best films I've ever seen.",5,exceptional a mix of BIG creative talents,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,3566,"['Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'exceptional', 'mix', 'two', 'creative', 'talents-', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'author', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'recent', 'winner', 'Pulitzer', 'Road', 'own', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'could', 'imagine', 'converge', 'story', 'lessor', 'hands', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'B', 'movie', 'story', 'concerns', 'average', 'Joe', 'out', 'hunting', 'one', 'day', 'Texas', 'who', 'bunch', 'dead', 'bodies', 'heroin', 'satchel', '2', 'million', 'cash', 'knowing', 'true', 'embodiment', 'psychopath', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'trail', 'more', 'more', 'clear', 'fatalism', 'store', 'weathered', 'sheriff', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'also', 'trail', 'perpetulally', 'sad', 'eyes', 'looking', 'stolid', 'demeanor.More', 'also', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'morality', 'play', 'one', 'could', 'ask', 'tools', 'very', 'serious', 'questions', 'what', 'moral', 'what', ""n't"", 'what', 'so', 'ambiguous', 'up', 'toss', 'coin', 'chance', 'ride', 'town', 'are', 'few', 'interpretations', 'Bardem', 'character', 'Anton', 'could', 'be', 'taken', 'one', 'thing', 'certain-', 'less', 'symbol', 'real', 'presence', 'ghost', 'Jones', 'sheriff', 'can', 'come', 'around', 'drop', 'pin', 'usually', 'dark', 'strike', 'utmost', 'fear', 'confusion', ""'re"", 'clerk', 'hearts', 'men', 'women', ""'ll"", 'never', 'look', 'coin', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'air-gun', 'fixing', 'bullet', 'wound', 'leg', 'hunt', 'motel', 'even', 'aftermath', 'car', 'crash.But', 'same', 'time', 'purest', 'time', 'cinema', 'recalling', 'Hitchcock', 'Leone', 'Welles', 'Touch', 'Evil', 'best', 'noir', 'westerns', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'exceptional', 'shots', 'lighting', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'perception', 'characters', 'mis-en-scene', 'so', 'much', 'tension', 'up', 'actors', 'make', 'break', 'near-perfection', 'McCarthy', 'source', 'Bardem', 'Anton', 'other', 'could-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'eyes', 'often', 'steel-cold', 'horrifically', 'professional', 'what', 'professional', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'occasional', 'tear-', 'obviously', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'are', 'also', 'fantastic', 'see', 'Brolin', 'often', 'midst', 'action', 'scene', 'moment', ""'save-your-life"", 'going', 'one', 'can', 'finally', 'see', 'actor', 'caliber', 'completely', 'breaking', 'out', 'role', ""n't"", 'require', 'ever', 'totally', 'emote', 'Jones', 'other', 'hand', 'compassionate', 'turn', 'film', 'struggles', 'desperate', 'men', 'land', 'law', 'order', 'gone', 'so', 'much', 'out', 'completely', 'voice', 'eyes', 'sorrowful', 'holding', 'back', 'level', 'connection', 'character', 'Fugitive', 'look', 'simpleton', 'TV', 'Kelly', 'McDonald', 'who', 'Lleland', 'wife', 'also', 'excellent', 'when', 'called', 'upon', 'especially', 'crucial', 'scene', 'later', 'film.It', 'gut-wrenching', 'bleak', 'violent', 'super-tense', 'clenched', 'many', 'knuckle', 'scenes', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'darkly', 'comic', 'manner', 'not', 'seen', 'Coens', 'many', 'years', 'artistically', 'fashioned', 'beat', 'meditative', 'watch', 'opening', 'moments', 'Jones', 'voice-over', 'simple', 'doomed', 'beautiful', 'terribly', 'tragic', 'McCarthy', 'fans', 'finally', 'what', 'truest', 'material-', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'Road', 'will', 'give', 'indication', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'hand-', 'moment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'pick', 'year-', 'maybe', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

He is mostly eerily silent and when he does talk it is quietly and controlled, he is ruthless, unrelenting and with an almost psychopathic element to his nature. This alone would make for compelling viewing before you add in the storyline of the film. From the word go this film has a dark and brooding atmosphere to it and the tension is palpable and only builds as it progresses. Following one man who stumbles across a case full of money, another trying to track him down and the sheriff who is trying to protect and serve, provides the hunter and hunted plot that keeps you fully engrossed. This has amazing performances from all involved, Brolin, Lee-Jones and Bardem are all riveting to watch and this is probably Tommy Lee-Jones' best performance to date. You get the added bonus of Woody Harrelson in a minor role and yet he still manages to deliver another top job as he always does. At just under two hours this film isn't excessively long and I found myself intrigued and on edge the whole time. The ending kind of fizzled out after ratcheting up the tension (hence the four stars) but overall this makes for satisfying viewing. This is one of those films on Amazon that seems to be either loved or hated and it has to be said that it's not your Hollywood, all action blockbuster, but it's all the better for that.

One that you can leave the theater with and feel satisfied with, and know that all stories were eventually resolved one way or the other.  This movie is disgustingly void of that after over 2 hours worth of a slow-going plot.But as an avid movie watcher, I can't comprehend how for almost 2 hours we are being led on by this impending climax that never comes.  The film has a feel that it's building up to an eventual showdown between protagonist and antagonist and that couldn't be further from what actually happens.  Certain scenes and dialogue lead you to believe that there will be a final showdown between Moss and Chigur, but the story takes and incredible 180 spin and leaves Moss dead in some hotel room with no conclusion to what seemed like an impending clash between protagonist and antagonist that was blatantly set up within the first 10-15 of the movie in a flick that was over 2 hours.  I mean come on, how can you walk away and say that you've seen a masterpiece?  The movie had its moments, particularly Tommy Lee Jones and his rollercoaster of emotions throughout the film as he realizes he's more of the old school type of law enforcement.  He's not ready to deal with this new kind of psychopathic terror.  I was pleasantly pleased with his performance.  However, I can't say the same for the rest of the actors with all due respect to them.  Dialogue was sketchy at best and there's no sense in fooling an audience to believe this is a ""thriller"" film.Not deserving of all its praise and certainly not deserving of all its accolades and awards.

It is an intriguing thriller set in Texas and centred on the bad karma generated by the illicit drug trade. Josh Brolin's character comes upon the aftermath of a desert shootout where he finds a suitcase containing $2 million dollars in bank notes. Understandably, he decides to keep the money and is afterwards pursued by a psychopath, played by Javier Bardem, who determines questions of life and death with the flip of a coin before dispatching his victims with a type of air gun used to slaughter cattle in meat works. Woody Harrelson and Tommy Lee Jones are also in the hunt,  Woody as an overly confident bounty hunter and Tommy as an ageing sheriff on the verge of retirement. The movie belongs to Brolin and Badem.

Fargo is still one of my all-time favorite movies, but No Country is up there now, too. I first saw No Country in the theater. I liked it, but didn't plan to buy it or watch it again for awhile. I don't know what happened, but the more I thought about it the more I wanted to buy it when it came out on DVD. So I did. And every time I watch it it's just better and better.While Fargo has a humorous side that keeps the edge off, No Country does not. It is dark, serious, and heavy. But it is so finely crafted, such a joy to behold, and so well-acted that it keeps you into it. I'll be honest, though - I've seen some other Coen brothers films like Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink and I personally don't think that they are masters of character development and drawing the audience into the story and into caring about the characters. There always seems to be some detachment. I think it is because of the artistic quality. Their movies, especially No Country, are so finely crafted from a technical and cinematography viewpoint that I think something of the human quality gets lost.But, that's a minor point, and if you want that kind of movie, go see another director's work.

85372,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,0788882988,Steven Aldersley,"[3, 4]","***Spoilers Within***Oscar ceremonies are sometimes dominated by one or two films because the opposition is weak, but that definitely wasn't the case in 2008. Nominees included No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, Juno, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Ratatouille, Once, The Bourne Ultimatum, Into the Wild, Atonement, Michael Clayton, Eastern Promises and American Gangster.I was torn at the time because I couldn't decide whether I wanted There Will Be Blood or No Country for Old Men to win for Best Picture. In hindsight, my two favorite films from that year are Juno and No Country for Old Men. I think the Academy got it right for once by awarding No Country for Old Men the Best Picture Oscar and Daniel Day-Lewis Leading Actor.So why do I think that No Country for Old Men deserved its win?The film contains so many strong elements. It gave us three memorable characters and expertly combined their three viewpoints to give us a compelling story. Roger Deakins did another wonderful job showing us the bleak Texas landscape, while the direction and writing were both superb.Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) makes a discovery while hunting for antelope. After tracking an injured animal, he finds what appears to be the result of a failed drug deal. Five trucks are surrounded by corpses and he deduces that the last man standing would have looked for shade. He eventually locates the final corpse and finds a case containing two million dollars. Moss lives in a trailer with his wife and the money represents a chance to completely change his life.The most interesting character is Anton Chigurh (Bardem). We see him captured by police at the start of the film, but he escapes and kills a deputy in the process. He is extremely violent and his motives are unclear. At times he appears supernatural in the way he evades capture. Is he supposed to represent Death or the Devil? Bardem makes Chigurh one of the most memorable villains ever to appear on screen. There's a scene which rivals Tarantino's farmhouse scene in Inglourious Basterds in terms of tension. Chigurh has a conversation with a gas station owner and it ends with a coin flip. The scene is both absurd and chilling at the same time. We know what's at stake.The other major character is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Jones). He's old, wise and extremely competent. Some of his choices show that he's more concerned with self-preservation than pursuing criminals, but he somehow gets the job done. One of his strengths is the ability to reconstruct crime scenes. He has a dry sense of humor and uncanny instincts.The first part of the story focuses on Moss. He's an experienced tracker and a Vietnam veteran and we see him trying to evade pursuit. At first, he doesn't know who will be coming after him, but eventually learns that it's Chigurh. Instead of simply leaving the country, he decides to face Chigurh himself. That might seem to be a stupid choice, but Moss does have some intelligence and appears able to take care of himself.Chigurh also seems highly competent and we get the sense that he's being doing what he does for a very long time. His pursuit is relentless. When he is injured, he's able to take care of his own wounds. He does bleed, but there's still the sense that he either is, or he at least represents, a supernatural force.I won't reveal any more of the plot. I have heard two complaints about the film. One is the level of violence present and the other is the unusual ending. I think the ending is partly showing how unpredictable life can be, but I understand the complaints. I thought the ending was appropriate and my only regret was that I couldn't watch these characters for longer.No Country for Old Men is many things. On the surface, it's the story of an extended chase. The Coen brothers said that it is a story of a good, evil and something between the two. Moss can be perceived as good or evil, but he's definitely committing a crime.Some of the scenes require us to pay close attention to the events and contain very little dialogue. It reminds me of the opening sequence in There Will Be Blood in that way. It succeeds because of the writing and the tension that's present throughout the story. If you enjoy thrillers, this is one of the best I have seen.The Blu-ray presentation is just about perfect. Every little sound comes across clearly and the Texas scenery looks breathtaking at times.",5,You can't stop what's coming,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,4399,"['***Spoilers', 'Within***Oscar', 'ceremonies', 'are', 'sometimes', 'dominated', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'opposition', 'weak', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', '2008', 'Nominees', 'included', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Juno', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'Ratatouille', 'Once', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'Into', 'Wild', 'Atonement', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'American', 'Gangster.I', 'was', 'torn', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'wanted', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'hindsight', 'two', 'favorite', 'films', 'year', 'are', 'Juno', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'think', 'Academy', 'got', 'right', 'once', 'awarding', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Leading', 'Actor.So', 'why', 'do', 'think', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'deserved', 'win', 'film', 'contains', 'so', 'many', 'strong', 'elements', 'gave', 'three', 'memorable', 'characters', 'expertly', 'combined', 'three', 'viewpoints', 'give', 'compelling', 'story', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showing', 'bleak', 'Texas', 'landscape', 'direction', 'writing', 'were', 'superb.Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'Brolin', 'discovery', 'hunting', 'antelope', 'tracking', 'injured', 'animal', 'what', 'be', 'result', 'failed', 'drug', 'deal', 'Five', 'trucks', 'are', 'surrounded', 'corpses', 'last', 'man', 'standing', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'shade', 'eventually', 'final', 'corpse', 'case', 'containing', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'Moss', 'trailer', 'wife', 'money', 'chance', 'completely', 'change', 'life.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'Bardem', 'see', 'captured', 'police', 'start', 'film', 'deputy', 'process', 'extremely', 'violent', 'motives', 'are', 'unclear', 'times', 'supernatural', 'way', 'capture', 'supposed', 'represent', 'Death', 'Devil', 'Bardem', 'Chigurh', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'villains', 'ever', 'appear', 'screen', 'scene', 'Tarantino', 'farmhouse', 'scene', 'Inglourious', 'Basterds', 'terms', 'tension', 'Chigurh', 'conversation', 'gas', 'station', 'owner', 'coin', 'flip', 'scene', 'absurd', 'chilling', 'same', 'time', 'know', 'what', 'stake.The', 'other', 'major', 'character', 'Sheriff', 'Ed', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'Jones', 'old', 'wise', 'extremely', 'competent', 'choices', 'show', 'more', 'concerned', 'self-preservation', 'pursuing', 'criminals', 'somehow', 'job', 'done', 'One', 'strengths', 'ability', 'reconstruct', 'crime', 'scenes', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'uncanny', 'instincts.The', 'first', 'part', 'story', 'Moss', 'experienced', 'tracker', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'see', 'trying', 'evade', 'pursuit', 'first', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'eventually', 'Chigurh', 'Instead', 'simply', 'leaving', 'country', 'face', 'Chigurh', 'might', 'seem', 'be', 'stupid', 'choice', 'Moss', 'have', 'intelligence', 'able', 'take', 'care', 'himself.Chigurh', 'also', 'highly', 'competent', 'get', 'sense', 'being', 'doing', 'what', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'pursuit', 'relentless', 'When', 'injured', 'able', 'take', 'care', 'own', 'wounds', 'bleed', 'still', 'sense', 'least', 'supernatural', 'force.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'more', 'plot', 'have', 'heard', 'two', 'complaints', 'film', 'One', 'level', 'violence', 'present', 'other', 'unusual', 'ending', 'think', 'ending', 'partly', 'showing', 'how', 'unpredictable', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'understand', 'complaints', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'appropriate', 'only', 'regret', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'characters', 'longer.No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'many', 'things', 'surface', 'story', 'extended', 'chase', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'said', 'story', 'good', 'evil', 'something', 'two', 'can', 'be', 'perceived', 'good', 'evil', 'definitely', 'committing', 'crime.Some', 'scenes', 'require', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'events', 'contain', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'way', 'writing', 'tension', 'present', 'story', 'enjoy', 'thrillers', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen.The', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'just', 'perfect', 'little', 'sound', 'clearly', 'Texas', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'times']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 11]","There are literally hundreds of reviews of this DVD release on Amazon, so I'm sure this review will not make a lot of difference but, after spending over two hours watching the film - and some time with the - FIVE HOURS of bonus features (much rehashing why the film is a ""Classic"") - I'm left with many visual impressions (mostly those of Javier Bardem's face). But that is it. Once you start watching this film, you can't leave your seat; you are drawn in, waiting for the next move. But the ending is quick. Didn't Bob Newhart do this on TV. Were the last two hours a memory? Who's to decide? The Coen Brothers certainly won't tell you. They are wonderfully quirky. I loved their early films like ""Blood Simple"" because they were small and oddball. And ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" was a a musical masterpiece. But Oscar worthy as Best Picture? I can't agree.Just as importantly is the graphic violence. Sure ""Saving Private Ryan"" had it and won Best Picture. To be honest, I've only watched the second part of that film as the graphic violence was too much for me. The point could easily be made in less time. We saw these scenes on TV in the late 60s from the Vietnam War - but TV no longer shows the violence in Iraq on the nightly news.When a film is honored like ""No Country"" it attracts attention and teens and young adults will go to see it - or rent it. Unless I missed something in this film, violence is condoned and accepted as natural. How many impressionable young (or even old) people will go out and get one of those ""air guns"" - or whatever they are called - that Bardem uses to break into room or kill people. Do you need a license for those? The Coens have always used violence but it was comic book violence with humor. I saw no humor here and the quality of the production - from great scenic photography to great acting - put this in a class well above the Rambo and ""Die Hard"" action pictures.It seems no one is ""middle of the road"" when it comes to loving or hating this film. And that's okay. But my only comment is that before you watch it you should be prepared for graphic violence equal to modern war films and use that as a guide when watching it with your children.

Upon searching, Brolin finds a satchel with $2 million in it, and he takes the money. So much more happens after that, but suffice it to say that two men end up on his trail - the town sheriff, played by Tommy Lee Jones, and a hitman looking for the money, played by Javier Bardem.It will be hard for another movie this year to be as good as this one.

The Coen Brothers really are at the peak of their game with this film, a crazy soliloquy on life and those caught in the web of seemingly random violence and events where no one can possibly have any say on the outcome. Add to this pitch perfect performances by Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Kelly McDonald and Javier Bardem, who plays one of the scariest killers ever to grace the screen. There's a reason this film won the awards that it did and it shows in every frame.The DVD looks very nice and does justice to the cinematography by Roger Deakins, who was also nominated for this film. The colors are all replicated nicely and contrast is very high in nighttime scenes. The DD 5.1 surround is very effective, especially in scenes where gunfire is involved. I guess the only place that this DVD would be lacking is in the extras. You get three featurettes that are little more than fluff pieces and provide only a fleeting glimpse at the film's production. This is usually the case with Coen Bros. movies and it's kind of a disappointment but with the film being as good as it is and with it being presented in such high quality (as high as you can get on standard DVD anyway), I would strongly suggest picking this up.Also, this film rewards multiple viewings and it's worth watching again after watching the featurettes since they give a bit of insight to the film's title.",5,"Pick this DVD up, Friend-O",1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,1416,"['movie', 'just', 'phenomenal', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'really', 'are', 'peak', 'game', 'film', 'crazy', 'soliloquy', 'life', 'caught', 'web', 'seemingly', 'random', 'violence', 'events', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'possibly', 'have', 'say', 'outcome', 'Add', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'performances', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Kelly', 'McDonald', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'one', 'scariest', 'killers', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'reason', 'film', 'won', 'awards', 'did', 'frame.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'nice', 'justice', 'cinematography', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'film', 'colors', 'are', 'replicated', 'nicely', 'contrast', 'very', 'high', 'nighttime', 'scenes', 'DD', '5.1', 'surround', 'very', 'effective', 'especially', 'scenes', 'where', 'gunfire', 'involved', 'guess', 'only', 'place', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'lacking', 'extras', 'get', 'three', 'featurettes', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'fluff', 'pieces', 'provide', 'only', 'fleeting', 'glimpse', 'film', 'production', 'usually', 'case', 'Coen', 'Bros.', 'movies', 'kind', 'disappointment', 'film', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'being', 'presented', 'such', 'high', 'quality', 'as', 'high', 'can', 'get', 'standard', 'DVD', 'anyway', 'would', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'picking', 'up.Also', 'film', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'watching', 'featurettes', 'give', 'bit', 'insight', 'film', 'title']",N/A

The Best Picture winning movie certainly had a head of steam leading up to the Oscars, in no small part due to the fact the Coen Brothers are responsible for it.The film is about a man who happens to find a suitcase with $2 million in cash at a scene where a drug deal has gone wrong. Like most people in that situation, the man (Llewelyn Moss) takes it. Finding one of them still alive, Moss leaves him for dead and heads home, until his conscience gets the best of him, forcing him to return to the scene to bring water to the dying man. Unfortunately, doing this alerts the surviving dealers of his existence, and the fact he has their money.The dealers then hire Anton Chigurh to track down Moss and take him out. Using a captive bolt pistol, Chigurh begins a trek through Texas and into Mexico, filled with death and destruction. While Chigurh is on the trail of Moss, Moss's wife flees to Odessa, to await for her husband. There she meets nearly-retired sheriff Ed Tom Bell, who vows to help Moss.Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, the Coens do a good job of adapting his material to film. (Much better than Billy Bob did in the past, at least.) It's certainly an odd film to watch (and equally hard to describe), but a powerful one nonetheless. The use of silence in the movie is a testament to how well the Coens understand their craft; rarely do you see any film using silence to this degree pull it off so damn well.Unfortunately, the movie tapers off in the third act. While the first two-thirds are some of the best I've seen in years, the latter half (especially the ending) deliver a blow to the movie-watching psyche much like Chigurh's murder weapon. Admittedly I've never read the McCarthy novel it's based on, but that shouldn't stop me from liking the ending, and the fact is I just plain didn't. It almost completely ruins the first two-thirds of the film, and in my mind (and my opinion) really brings down the quality of the overall picture.Is No Country a good movie? Yes. Is it great? Not really. It's no surprise it was nominated for Best Picture given all of the critical hype it received (it's really one of those movies critics HAVE to praise or they'll look stupid), but it shouldn't have won. In my mind, a certain milkshake drinking nominee should have taken home the Oscar. Still, you could do much worse than No Country if you're looking to have a night in at the movies. On the other hand, despite the cover's proclamation, you could do better as well.CONTENT - 3.5/5I remember growing up and going to Lakers games where the crowd would chant ""OVER-RATED!"" every time Kobe touched the ball. This feels the same way. Is No Country a good movie? Yes. The best of 2007? Not by a longshot. It's a movie people will like or hate for its own merits, and even more will like because they're supposed to. I fully expect to be flamed for my views, by the way, so have at you.VIDEO - 5/5Despite my reservations about the film, there's no questioning that the Coens are masters of camera work. The gritty look of the film, the scenery, and the presentation are awesome, especially when combined with the great transfer job. This will look amazing on your SD or HD, and that's what DVDs should do: look good for everyone.AUDIO - 3/5It's not often silence is a lead player in the audio of a movie, but when done right silence truly is golden. The rest of the movie features some nice 5.1 work, and although it's nothing breathtaking, the silence followed by the sound behind you really makes you feel like you're in the movie. Just watch out for people that have the whole ""sort of like a lesbian haircut"" that Anton has in real life, because you'll probably be terrified of them if they sneak up on you.EXTRAS - 3/5The Coens are never known for their DVD extras. Working With the Coens and the Making Of provide some nice looks into the process of the film, but compared to other titles the extras are relatively sparse. Then again, no fan of the Coens should expect anything different; it's just how they roll.REPLAY - 3/5Even if it's not an amazing movie, the value and presentation -- as well as the few key performances such as Anton and the Sheriff -- are fantastic, and will likely be watched again.

85389,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,0788882988,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[4, 6]","Watching ""No Country For Old Men"" reminds me of all the carnage and violence you would witness in other films like ""The Terminator"", ""Collateral"" and even ""Halloween"" - where one person (or being) engages in a senseless, non-stop killing spree in order to reach their target. The only difference here is that this film was wrapped up with a pretty bow by being labeled by critics as ""artsy"" and ""intellectually thrilling"" because it was viewed at the Cannes Film Festival and it's by the Coen Brothers. Well, whup-dee-damn-do. No matter who was behind it, let's call it what it is, shall we? Another movie with gratituous violence and random murders - nothing more, nothing less. Those elitist critics need to admit that they too, enjoy bloody action horror thrillers just as much as the next person instead of turning their noses up on other films of that genre.The story takes place in rural Texas, 1980. Stoic and menacing hitman and virtual killing machine Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) stops at nothing to retrieve a satchel of $2 million in cash from a drug deal gone bad. Vietnam veteran Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who happened to stumble across a bunch of dead Mexicans at the crime scene in the desert, found the money  - and took off with it. As he hunts down Moss, Chigurh leaves destruction in his wake by mowing down (mostly) innocent people in his way who have nothing to do with the theft of the money. This seemed pointless to me and makes it no better than any of those movies I mentioned above (which only one was given serious attention by the Oscars).  This is not a horrible film, but I fail to see the reason why it won four Oscars. Unless you happen to be Alfred Hitchcock - what is so artistic about murder? If that's the case, then all those movies that feature homicidal psychopaths like Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, Jason with the hockey mask and others slaughtering people at will with no cause should have been nominated for Oscars, too.The title, which refers to Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Bell character and his buddies, laments the changing times when times were simple in America, and being a law officer was less dangerous. Times when killing for drugs, or for no reason at all was almost unheard of outside of the inner city, the average criminal might be American, and the most daring thing they might have done was knock over a bank for a small pittance. But as Bob Dylan once sang, ""The times, they are a-changin'"", or as one of the characters sums it up in the movie, ""You can't stop what's coming."" These ""old men"" don't feel they have a place in this system anymore, where crimes become increasingly graphic but in turn, people are becoming apathetic in their reactions to it, which is nothing new. The bad guy doesn't always get caught in these times, either - something else that we know as well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't we hear this same type of dialogue before in the excellent thriller ""Seven"" with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman 13 years ago? Now THAT was Oscar-worthy.Jones might as well been playing the same character as Freeman did in that film because they both were police officers who shared the EXACT same philosophies and opinions about life, so there is really nothing new here. As a small town Texas sheriff on the brink of retirement who is trying to protect an on-the-run Moss before Chigurh gets to him, Jones as the aging Bell feels hopelessly out of step with this new breed of criminal, but is determined to keep Moss safe. I have no problem with the ending; it's just that I expected more.As I said previously, ""No Country For Old Men"" is far from being horrible. But all the accolades it received was only because of who made it. You can try to elevate it above films like ""Pulp Fiction"" (which is actually a GOOD film), ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or even the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" series but truthfully, there's not much difference between those films and this one, except maybe the actors - who do the best they can under the circumstances.  IMO, there's nothing special about it, but worth seeing at least once.",3,Nothing new to see here...,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,4101,"['Watching', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'carnage', 'violence', 'would', 'witness', 'other', 'films', 'Terminator', 'Collateral', 'even', 'Halloween', 'where', 'one', 'person', 'being', 'senseless', 'non-stop', 'killing', 'spree', 'order', 'reach', 'target', 'only', 'difference', 'here', 'film', 'was', 'wrapped', 'up', 'pretty', 'bow', 'being', 'labeled', 'critics', 'artsy', 'intellectually', 'thrilling', 'was', 'viewed', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Well', 'whup-dee-damn-do', 'No', 'matter', 'who', 'was', 'let', 'call', 'what', 'shall', 'movie', 'gratituous', 'violence', 'random', 'murders', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'elitist', 'critics', 'need', 'admit', 'too', 'enjoy', 'bloody', 'action', 'horror', 'thrillers', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'instead', 'turning', 'noses', 'up', 'other', 'films', 'genre.The', 'story', 'place', 'rural', 'Texas', '1980', 'Stoic', 'menacing', 'hitman', 'virtual', 'killing', 'machine', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'nothing', 'retrieve', 'satchel', '2', 'million', 'cash', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'Llewellyn', 'Moss', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'happened', 'stumble', 'bunch', 'dead', 'Mexicans', 'crime', 'scene', 'desert', 'found', 'money', 'took', 'off', 'down', 'Moss', 'Chigurh', 'destruction', 'wake', 'mowing', 'down', 'mostly', 'innocent', 'people', 'way', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'theft', 'money', 'seemed', 'pointless', 'better', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'given', 'serious', 'attention', 'Oscars', 'not', 'horrible', 'film', 'fail', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'won', 'four', 'Oscars', 'happen', 'be', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'what', 'so', 'artistic', 'murder', 'case', 'then', 'movies', 'feature', 'homicidal', 'psychopaths', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Freddy', 'Kruger', 'Jason', 'hockey', 'mask', 'others', 'slaughtering', 'people', 'will', 'cause', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'too.The', 'title', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'character', 'buddies', 'changing', 'times', 'when', 'times', 'were', 'simple', 'America', 'being', 'law', 'officer', 'was', 'less', 'dangerous', 'Times', 'when', 'killing', 'drugs', 'reason', 'was', 'almost', 'unheard', 'outside', 'inner', 'city', 'average', 'criminal', 'might', 'be', 'American', 'most', 'daring', 'thing', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'knock', 'bank', 'small', 'pittance', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'once', 'sang', 'times', 'are', 'a-changin', 'one', 'characters', 'sums', 'up', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'what', 'coming', 'old', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'have', 'place', 'system', 'anymore', 'where', 'crimes', 'become', 'increasingly', 'graphic', 'turn', 'people', 'are', 'becoming', 'apathetic', 'reactions', 'nothing', 'new', 'bad', 'guy', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'caught', 'times', 'something', 'else', 'know', 'as', 'well', 'Correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'same', 'type', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'thriller', 'Seven', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', '13', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'was', 'Oscar-worthy.Jones', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'Freeman', 'did', 'film', 'were', 'police', 'officers', 'who', 'shared', 'EXACT', 'same', 'philosophies', 'opinions', 'life', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'small', 'town', 'Texas', 'sheriff', 'brink', 'retirement', 'who', 'trying', 'protect', 'on-the-run', 'Moss', 'Chigurh', 'Jones', 'aging', 'Bell', 'feels', 'hopelessly', 'step', 'new', 'breed', 'criminal', 'determined', 'keep', 'Moss', 'safe', 'have', 'problem', 'ending', 'just', 'expected', 'more.As', 'said', 'previously', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'far', 'being', 'horrible', 'accolades', 'received', 'was', 'only', 'who', 'made', 'can', 'try', 'elevate', 'films', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'actually', 'GOOD', 'film', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'even', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'series', 'truthfully', 'not', 'much', 'difference', 'films', 'one', 'maybe', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'circumstances', 'IMO', 'nothing', 'special', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once']",N/A

This movie being an adaptation from a book, is a  true example of how the coen brothers appreciated what they read; and liked it so much they had to exemplify this on the big screen. This movie is one huge metaphor about life, about how times are changing, how life seems to be seeping out of control. The methaphor can be broken down to the nostalgia of the  days where criminals were not rampant in small towns. The days where drugs, were not overflowing the streets, the days were the level of violence and ruthlessness shown today couldn't possibly be imagined. This is an awesome film that needs to be watched with much attention in order to capture these subtle moments of greatness.

85391,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,0788882988,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[4, 5]","Relentless in method, challenging in presentation, and unforgettable in execution, the Coen Brothers' adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's acclaimed novel glimpses upon pure genius in its characters and suspenseful build, but sacrifices much of the clarity (though not the power) of its narration in the strict adherence to its source material. Boasting some of the finest performances of the year, the Coen's fantastically intricate thriller demands an astute mind and a perceptive eye to decipher the multi-layered parallels that lie in No Country for Old Men.When Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and leaves with $2 million in cash, he is relentlessly pursued by several interested parties, including cunningly vicious psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), cocky hitman Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), and Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) . While Llewelyn struggles to stay alive and protect those he loves, the inevitable confrontation with his pursuers steadily closes in on him, as does unflinching fate and its inescapable finality.From the existentialist perspective on life, death and the inevitability of the revolutions of the future, No Country for Old Men examines several complex subjects, many requiring further investigation into the symbolisms of the characters and events portrayed. But what the film sacrifices in its quest to fully represent Cormac McCarthy's speculations and musings on human life is the conventionality of storytelling that many moviegoers all but demand. Initially the film follows Llewellyn's struggle to survive against the unyielding force of Anton's steely-eyed psychotic killer. The film builds with suspense and flawless pacing, allowing the audience to acknowledge and become familiar with these two characters and their missions. But the harsh transition back to Sheriff Bell's narration and story arc is a difficult change for viewers who were so heavily immersed in the chaotic thrills of Moss' and Chigurh's riveting chase.Almost as if we're cheated out of seeing each subplot through to completion, No Country for Old Men jumps around not in its time sequencing, but with its time lapses. Events most viewers would determine to be crucial to witness are not shown, instead displaying aftermaths and subsequent events that are supposed to appease our wandering minds. While this method of storytelling is both radically unique and faithful to the source material, it lessens the appeal to general audiences who expect basic information to be served up in a relatively understandable manner. Here is a film that actually appeals to critics more than to fans, and sadly the balance is a little off-kilter, resulting in too much Barton Fink and not enough Fargo. Although one gets the distinct feeling that the Coen Brothers chose this novel based on the similarities in its story and narrative to their own style and previous films, the result is one that still feels specifically like a Coen Brothers movie, despite the adaptation of another's story.While No Country may not find perfection in its unorthodox narrative, what has found cinematic sublimity are the performances. Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss pulls the audience in to his desperate situation and though his motives aren't noble by any means, never is there a doubt who you should be rooting for. A victim of greed, obstinance, and unfortunate circumstances, Llewelyn provides an antihero whose pressing journey never ebbs in intensity or moral conflict, and ultimately never ceases to intrigue. Almost destined for an Oscar nomination, Javier Bardem's monumental portrayal of ruthless killer Anton Chigurh reinvents the notion of an unstoppable juggernaut and also realizes one of the most imaginative instruments of murder ever given its wielder. Violently dispatching his victims with a fateful coin toss and an incomprehensible code of honor, Chigurh blends the best of stone-faced serial killers from the finest slashers with the cold and calculating demeanor of the most intelligent of his kind. Rarely does such a deviously twisted character create such a mesmerizing presence. While Tommy Lee Jones provides much of the sarcastic, witty dialogue inherent to the Coen Brothers' films, he also represents a narrator of sorts and offers the audience an untainted view of the horrific events unfolding. The supporting cast all turn in admirable performances as well, most notably Woody Harrelson as the egotistic Carson Wells, and Kelly Macdonald as Llewelyn's innocently nave wife.A brilliant examination of unavoidable fate and unconventional storytelling, the Coen Brothers' latest effort is one of masterful precision. Though the story is based on McCarthy's famous novel, No Country for Old Men still retains the unmistakable mark of the directing duo, and combined with phenomenal characters in a brutally unforgiving world, this thrilling saga of murder, mayhem, and destiny should not be missed.- The Massie Twins",4,No Country for Old Men Movie Review,1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,4982,"['Relentless', 'method',

The actors are particularly strong in their roles and the storytelling is lean and driven.

85395,A3M2WW0PO34B94,0788882988,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 6]","I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers, the duo behind such classics as ""Fargo"", ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", ""Blood Simple"" and ""Raising Arizona"". Their films gleefully mix a sense of humor so dark it could almost be black with whacky, off-center characters who get involved with violent events. When I first heard about ""No Country for Old Men"", their new film based on a story by Cormac McCarthy, I was intrigued. ""Country"" appeared to have the same sort of wacky characters they are known for, but without the dark humor, placing these people in a dark, dramatic, violent story.""No Country For Old Men"" is even better than I could have imagined. It will be one of the best films of the year.Texas, 1980. Lewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin, ""American Gangster"") is out hunting when he happens across some blood. Following the trail, he finds the scene of a massacre, a bunch of off-road trucks in a circle, a bunch of dead guys, most of them Latino, and a truck filled with drugs. He continues to look around and finds one of the victims sitting under a tree with a satchel filled with $[...] million sitting at his feet. Lewellyn knows the owner of this money will not simply let the money disappear, but he decides to play the odds and makes off with it. He hides it under his mobile home and tells his wife (Kelly McDonald) she has to go and visit her mother in Odessa. Anton Chiguhr (Javier Bardem) is sent to recover the money and the drugs. Visiting the scene of the crime, he quickly realizes someone else was there and figures out it was Lewellyn. Anton made a commitment to find and recover the money and he will not let anything, repeat anything, stand in the way of his commitment. Soon, he is hounding Lewellyn's every step, using his weapon of choice, a can of pneumatic air and a cattle stun gun to remove any obstacles, including people and locked doors. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his deputy (Garrett Dillahunt, ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"") happen upon the crime scene and also realize Lewellyn was involved, but at this point, they are a few steps behind, so Bell decides to try to contact Lewellyn's wife in Odessa. If it was that easy for Bell to find the wife, you know Chiguhr (mispronounced ""Sugar"" by more than one person) will have no trouble. Thus begins an intense game of cat and mouse featuring one of the most reprehensible, evil villains I have ever seen on film.""No Country for Old Men"" is a violent film, but it seems more violent than it is and that is because of the mesmerizing performance of Javier Bardem. With a fish bowl haircut and a crooked grin complemented by dead eyes, Bardem's Chiguhr is a bit like a flesh and bones version of Schwarzenegger's Terminator. To call Chiguhr human would be wrong; there is nothing in this character that is human. From the moment he escapes custody and dispatches the deputy who has no idea what wrath he has brought upon himself, Chiguhr cuts a swatch across the Texas landscape, all in his quest to retrieve the money for his employer. Using the cattle gun, he leaves no traces of gunpowder or bullets in his victims, leading the authorities to come up with no clues. But worse than that, Chiguhr seems happiest when he is killing people.As he is about to claim a victim, his mouth breaks into a crooked smile and his lifeless eyes attain a little glitter. Worse yet, people seem mesmerized by him and, since he rarely uses a gun or knife, they don't seem to be threatened when he approaches with a large can of compressed air and a cattle gun.As he begins his quest, Chiguhr also realizes this device can be used to get through locks and do so in such a way as to stun the intended victims.As Bardem works to make this character one of the most evil I have ever seen on film, the Coen Brothers do a very smart thing. Both actor and filmmakers have so clearly established the villainy of this character, and the lengths he will go to, that they actually stop showing us the full extent of his acts upon his victims. We know what he is capable of, so when he dispatches one victim, it is enough to see a pool of blood slowly approach his boots. When he leaves another victims house, he checks his boots for blood, signaling to us what has just happened. Just like in the best horror films, our imagination fills in the details in a far scarier and effective way.Josh Brolin is also very good as Lewellyn, a tough guy used to having to work for everything he has, and he doesn't have much. The key to his performance is that he is able to make us believe he might just have a chance against Chiguhr, a remarkable accomplishment given how evil his adversary is. When Lewellyn initially stumbles across the crime scene, he shows us a certain level of smarts, he knows how to check the scene, how to protect himself, what he is looking for. A lot of this must come from his hunting background, as there isn't any indication that he stumbles across a drug deal gone badly every day. When he sees the money, his greed overtakes him and he runs off with it. But he also has the common sense to try to hide it, and not immediately begin spending it, because that would raise too many suspicions in his small community.And Lewellyn also has a conscience leading him to try to help one of the victims. This ultimately leads Chiguhr to him, so this act also leads us to suspect he isn't always the best at making decisions.In a way, the Coen Brothers have returned to their roots with ""Country"". Much like their brilliant debut ""Blood Simple"", this new film is pure drama, with a lot of violence, and it also seems to revisit some of the same classic types of situations they tried in their first film. But because they have matured as filmmakers, they have also developed their skills and these scenes are even more powerful. As Chiguhr hunts down Lewellyn, he tracks his prey with steely determination. Lewellyn hides out in an old hotel in a small Texas town. After he checks in, he looks through the bag of money. Soon, he senses something, a presence, and tries to prepare. This begins a chase through the small town with Chiguhr and Lewellyn facing off in the dark, silent town, leaving a few dead in their wake. As I watched, I remembered a similar scene in ""Simple"" when Ray (John Getz) is trying to outwit Loren (M. Emmett Walsh), the determined private eye, who is a little like Chiguhr-lite. Both scenes are very effective, but well-seasoned filmmakers, confident of their craft and skill, craft ""Country"". ""Simple"" is exciting because the filmmakers who made that film were very raw.With all of this madness circulating, much like a hurricane flowing through this Texas landscape, Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Bell is the perfect antidote. Calm, seasoned, intelligent, he looks at something and can pretty accurately assess the situation. He and his deputy have amusing conversations, with Bell almost always correctly contradicting his younger deputy's theories. He provides the grounding force to the story.Strangely, Bell is almost immediately able to figure out that Lewellyn was involved in this mess, in some way, but he is now a couple of steps behind the local and his pursuer. He knows he should contact his wife, Carla Jean, and even knows where she probably is, but she doesn't offer any help. So he does the only thing he can do and follows the path of destruction, hoping to eventually cross paths with the two men.Woody Harrelson has a brief turn as a private detective hired by the same people who hired Chiguhr. He sets out to try and persuade Lewellyn to return the money. When Chiguhr finds out someone has been sent to clean up after him, he becomes, shall we say, a little upset.""No Country For Old Men"" is a great, great film. There are so many things to like about it, it is impossible to list them all without revealing key moments in the plot. Everything, from the memorable performances, to the storytelling, to the cinematography is outstanding. Javier Bardem's performance won't soon be forgotten. And the fact the Coen Brothers are smart enough to realize that at a certain point, we only need the merest hint of violence to realize Chiguhr has been up to his usual business if particularly impressive. And yet another example of why the film is so effective.",5,"A Classic - No Ifs, Ands or Buts",1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,8295,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'duo', 'such', 'classics',

I have to agree with a previous reviewer that noted that this film carries the atmosphere of the Coens' great Blood Simple from the '80's.  It was one of those rare ones where I was consciously aware that I was enjoying it, and hoped it wouldn't end soon.No need to rehash the plot (read elsewhere).  But the thoughtful treatment here provides much to observe and ponder regarding: deterioration in our society and values, hard honest work, greed, love and loyalty, human evil, the struggle of law enforcement.Superb story, direction, cinematography.  Superb cast (Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem).  A sour note on casting -- who signed off on Woody Harrelson as the schoolboyish  ""killer"" in the dorky 10-gallon cowboy hat?  To me he's still an idiot bartender in a sitcom, and I've never forgiven him for leading in Cold-Blooded Killers -- a disgusting murderfest.So -- Woody Harrelson aside, a most highly recommended film.

So I have to say, I enjoyed this movie.  That being said, it is also not one of their better films, as it has some serious problems with it.The acting in this movie, as with a lot of their films, is good.  These guys pick good actors and know how to get the most out of them.  For me, the highlight was Tommy Lee Jones.  The man has mastered the art of playing the weathered country lawman.  He does play this one more tired then he has most of the time.  Considering he usually plays tired, this is saying something, but it works for the character.  Harrelson is also great, even though he is only in the film for a short time.  Josh Brolin, who I usually am not a huge fan of, delivers a passable performance.  The only person who bugged me was Javier Bardem.  I am not sure if it is him or the way the character is written I don't like, but I find something off-putting.The story itself starts great.  I love their decision to open their serious films with a voice over.  This one works particularly well, with Jone's voice really bringing out the mood of the dialog.  The pacing of the film is fine, keeping you engaged.Then the movie hits a snag.  The ending is a real problem.  They were clearly trying to go against movie tradition, but I don't think it worked.  The third act is incredibly anti-climatic, with the death of a main character happening off screen.  Then the movie just sort of, ends.  Usually, the end of their movies is one of the bright points, so it was disappointing to see the way this ended.I do like this movie, and would recommend it.  However, the audience may leave feeling a bit put out.

I can't watch a movie that won Best Picture and just say, ""Yeah, even though that guy was about an hour away from bleeding to death in his pick-up truck in 100 degree temperatures, I'm sure a mans (Brolins) conscience would wake him up in the middle of the night to take the cat a jug of water.""  I mean, that right there doesn't make a lick of sense, but so what?  The actions that proceed that are pretty fantastic and suspenseful.The first 3/4's of this, you really don't know what's going to happen and you'd have to be in a coma for it not to get your heart pounding, but that abruptly ends and there is very little redeeming qualities for the final 30 minutes.I think the biggest problem I have with this is (A) Woody Harrelson and (B) Tommie Lee Jones.  There is no reason for Harrelson to even be in this movie.  His character just takes up space and valuable screen time, offering nothing in the grand scheme of things.  It's a complete waste of time and it leaves you scratching your head saying, ""Why was....what is he doing....what is he supposed to be...""  yeah.My problem with Tommie isn't his character or him as an actor, but he is really set up as the third ingredient of this story as far as I am concerned.  Yes, he is involved in a murder investigation and he is trying to track down the Brolin character before the hitman finds him, but he is almost an after thought in the first 90 minutes.  Then in one scene, he takes over and the final 30-40 minutes of this thing is about him trying to figure out why this world is just so darn crazy.  The film takes a complete 180 degree turn...and I didn't feel it was for the better at all.I was disappointed after such a fantastic start...and that is the most demoralizing type of film:  One that gets you so cranked up for so long and leaves you wondering what type of narcotics the writer(s) and filmmaker(s) took to turn a Porsche into a Hyundai Sonata (a Sonata without the wood paneling interior, at that).It also bothered me that the film unintentionally puts hunters in a bad light.  Brolin never does find the pronghorn he wounds and tries to track down.

85413,A96K1ZGW56S2I,0788882988,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[8, 13]","Before even watching the movie, one should take into account that on the surface, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN should be a good movie.  The film is based upon a novel by Cormac McCarthy.  It's a Coen brothers' picture, meaning that Joel and Ethan Coen wrote, directed, edited, and co-produced the picture.  The cast is composed of mostly talented, though underrated actors, including Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones.  I realize that many times movies with similar credentials have been complete flops.  Thankfully, that isn't the case with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.The Coens return to the type of filmmaking, like that of BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, that gave them a following.  The film revolves around three very distinct and different characters.  First there is Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) an everyman slacker. Despite his lack of ambition, his wife loves him and they have a good relationship. Llewellyn stumbles upon what appears to have been a shootout over a drug deal gone bad amidst a circle of vehicles in the back country.  Slaughtered bodies lie scattered across the field.  Llewellyn locates the apparent ""survivor"" of the massacre who lies dead beneath a tree along with a briefcase full of money.  Llewellyn gives in to the temptation and takes the money, thereby placing himself on the top of the list of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a murderous psychopath who sometimes decides the fate of his victims with the flip of a coin.Chigurh is the second focal character in the film.  Chigurh is another symbolic character that seems to represent everything that has gone wrong with the U.S.  He is a murderer and stops at nothing to get his way.  Yet, there is an almost twisted logic to some of his actions.  He never contradicts the coin he carries--it is his lord.  He also never breaks a promise; a trait that would be a good thing in most people, but a trait that becomes horrifying in psychopathic murderer.  Chigurh chases Llewellyn across the country with a ruthless abandon.  Along the way, Chigurh settles the score with other men that have crossed his path before.The final focal character is sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones).  Bell is on the verge of retirement.  His father was a lawman as was his father before him.  The world has changed dramatically since Bell was a young officer.  Violent crime and illegal drugs coming across the border are common occurrences.  Bell feels that he is the last of dying breed; the last of an old tradition. He has the nose of a detective and is chasing Chigurh and trying to catch the demon before he causes anymore violence, but he always seems to be just one step behind.  He doesn't realize it at the time, but his hunt to capture Chigurh is the last of his career before he retires to live in a place that truly is ""no country for old men.""I really enjoyed NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.  The movie is serious, but has comical moments that relieve the tension.  The cinematography and settings are almost majestic in their simplicity and barrenness.  The acting is top of the line and Bardem, Brolin, and Jones each give great performances.  Even though there are no car chases, super powers, sword fights, or pirates, the film kept me on the edge of my seat as I tried to guess what was going to happen next, root for Llewellyn Moss to escape, and hope that Ed Tom Bell would meet Chigurh in a final showdown.I realize that even though I liked the film, there are many who won't.  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a dark and depressing picture.  It offers no solace, no comfort, very little joy, and paints a picture of the future as being almost hopeless.  It also doesn't have a nice, tight ending.  I liked the film as a work of film, but when I left the theatre after seeing the movie for the first time, I was so saddened by what I had seen that I cried for a few minutes in my car.  Very few dark films have touched me like that.  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2007.

85417,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,0788882988,Unlucky Frank,"[59, 167]","Finally, a violent Art Film that the critics can enjoy too, without feeling guilty about it. And they can spew some pseudo-intellectual nonsense about how transcendent it is symbolically. It's not. It's really intellectual hypocrisy. (My reasons are at the bottom of this review.)A friend and I were discussing the blank negativity that seems to be permeating The Hollywood Landscape of filmmaking these days. Children having children, children killing children, killing and murder, murder musicals, and torture porn. (Richard Roeper's term for the latest trend in horror films.) This film came up in the conversation. My friend called it ""dysfunction of the human spirit."" I wish I had said that.My friend is fairly brilliant because that's what this film is really all about... And, the fact that you can use a cattle punch to kill people and open locked doors. This is a film that proselytizes against it's very own dysfunction. It's cynical and depressing filmmaking with a self-abnegating moral. I know a lot of the blame for this lies with the author. I know someone who read it. Apparently, it was just as dysfunctional as the film.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a violent exploitation film that is posing as a deep moral artistic statement about society. It's not. It's really a violent lowbrow crime drama about a killer chasing a guy that stole some drug money. On the peripheral, a lawman and some other interested parties, including a bounty hunter played by Woody Harrelson (what a waste of a great cameo), are also giving chase and making pretentious speeches.The film has some good noir elements. Like blood leaking out of cowboy footwear, a wounded dog limping across the plains, and lots of dead and bloody bodies lying around. Booyay!The cinematography and direction are topnotch. It has a great look. My guess is that it was not shot on film, but digitally. (You may correct me if I'm wrong.) Which allows the cinematographer to shoot at night using only the ambient light of the location. Lighting a shot is the most time consuming aspect of filmmmaking.The beginning of the film is quite stunning, and I thought I was in for a real treat as far as the storytelling goes. But, the unbelievable plot degenerates into a dull chase with lots of homicidal killings. (See my review on Michael Mann's COLLATERAL.) The story is fairly pedestrian and mostly dumb. It's full of holes. Not just bullet holes, but plot holes. (SPOILER ALERT) Bardem strangles a sheriff and murders an innocent motorist with a cattle punch and no one alerts the FBI? There is no massive manhunt or statewide dragnet? R-i-g-h-t. I just knew the satchel of money contained a transponder. I even yelled, ""transponder,"" outloud in the theater before it was said or revealed later in the film. No one was in the theater to tell me to ""shut up."" Ho-hum.It has a cast of mostly underdeveloped characters. Javier Bardem plays a cartoonish sociopath and is not particularly menacing in his Prince Valiant haircut. He makes a face when he kills like he's just eaten the best ice cream ever. Pretty hammy. And Tommy Lee Jones plays the same old lawman that he always plays in movies. The killer gives two of his potential victims the choice of life or death, with the toss of a coin. A sociopath with a conscience. Then, he nonchalantly walks around town in the open with a cattle punch and a silenced shotgun, pleasantly shooting and almost killing everyone in sight. Mostly at night. But, also in broad daylight. I guess there are no people in Texas. Or no people in Texas with phones. Realism is not at fault in this film. I guess it takes place in Bizarro World. Or Bizarro Texas. Apparently, the killer got that cool coin at The Bizarro Franklin Mint in Bizarro Pennsylvania. ""Truth is stranger than fiction?"" Yeah, whatever.Towards the end of the film, how is the protagonist, played by Josh Brolin, found? Does it matter? What happens to Brolin's wife? Oh right, it's ambiguous. Resolution is antithetical to a Serial Killer Art Film.A couple of good oneliners make this feel like you might be watching a Coen Brothers film, but it's protagonists are not as comically inept as the ones in BLOOD SIMPLE or FARGO. There are some offbeat cameo characters that appear to be refugees from a David Lynch film. But, they feel like an afterthought. I chuckled a few times, but mostly, I yawned through this boring exercise of Art House Noir. I couldn't wait for this film to be over and I kept looking at my watch.My Uncle was a Commander in The L.A.P.D. for more than thirty years. Cops don't suddenly have an epiphany about evil and crime after a lifetime of law enforcement. They develop a hard outer shell very early because they deal with the scum of the earth on a daily basis. I  didn't recognize the lawman in this film at all.The message of this film seems to be saying ""that the times they are a changin'."" There was a time when a lawman could get the job done without a gun and some fancy detective work. Now the law is outmatched, which spells doom for all of us. The abhorrent underworld is now a part of the American landscape. And it's populated with sociopaths that kill and maim without remorse.  But this film revels in the killer's flair for creative mayhem. It's frolicking and wallowing in it's own blood. Intellectual hypocrisy in my book. You can't have it both ways. I have a problem with violent films that are proselytizing against the very violence that they are depicting. The villain in this film is depicted as an anti-hero. Bardem is made-up to look like some romantic medieval villain or hero. Maybe he respresents Prince Valiant or Robin Hood with that obnoxious hairdo and his strange game of chance. The depictions of brutal violence negate the message of the film. ""Do as I say, not as I do?"" SILENCE OF THE LAMBS depicted the very same intellectual hypocrisy, and won an Oscar for it. (Contrary to what The Academy or your teenage Emo son believes, Hannibal Lector is not a hero.) This will probably win one too. What a shame. But, I'm not buying into it.I actually enjoy films with violent content as long as it serves the story in some fashion. All this film has to offer is a double barreled shotgun sandwich, some depressing dimestore symbolism at the end, and no real resolution.(SPOILER) THE METAPHORICAL ENDING FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T GET IT: Evil survives when Bardem walks away. Good, metaphorically represented by Jones and his dream, is vanishing. The dream is a premonition of his death, both literally and metaphorically. I don't need the Coen brothers to tell me that good does not always triumph over evil, after splattering the screen with blood. There is nothing new here. ""Genius"" is defined by something that has never been postulated or presented before. The metaphor is old, and it's hardly genius. I get it. I just don't get what it's doing in this bloody lowbrow crime drama.This is not a great transcendent crime drama. It's a bad story mixed with violent sanctimonious self-righteous crud. This film strives for artistic merit, but it's really just another violent cartoon like THE HITCHER. That film was fun. This one was dull. I hated this flick.""We believe in nothing, Lebowski.""Yah, we believe in nothing.""If you want to see The Best Serial Killer film of 2007, see David Fincher's ZODIAC. That's a brilliant film. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a bloody overrated mess.IM, not so HO, this is the worst film The Coen Brothers have ever made. Joel and Ethan Coen deserve a spanking for this. I hope they get back on track with something funny.Apparently, the Critics are not as bright as they appear to be. America really is a dark and depressing place. Not because of this film's reflection of society. But, because films like this are being lionized by the masses as some sort of standard of excellence. Which is a sad reflection of America, in and of itself.Pseudo-Intellectual Nihilistic Hogwash.",1,PSEUDO INTELLECTUAL NIHILISTIC HOGWASH,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,7931,"['Finally', 'violent',

In one very graphic scene, Chigurh asks his victim to be still so he can line up the Captive Bolt Gun since the trigger mechanism is actuated when the muzzle is pressed against the head.In any event, I hope I have swayed those people who are not fascinated by squirting blood and horrific gun carnage to see this despicable film. You can always visit the slaughter houses instead to satisfy that primitive urge to see guns, blood, death and carnage, in color and live action (so to speak). I'm an old man, been through the Viet Nam war, saw enough of death and blood, but this film makes me disgusted. For the most part, when it comes to portraying anything close to real life, Hollywood really does a bad job of it and this film proves it.",1,Extreme and Gratuitous Violence,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,2739,"['enjoy', 'watching', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'slaughter', 'human', 'beings', 'grand', 'scale', 'watch', 'helpless', 'victims', 'plead', 'lives', 'then', 'film', 'made', 'want', 'throw', 'up', 'cinematic', 'garbage', 'would', 'have', 'question', 'own', 'sanity', 'were', 'entertained', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'kept', 'watching', 'thing', 'hoping', 'forces', 'good', 'would', 'somehow', 'overcome', 'forces', 'evil', 'struggle', 'perhaps', 'human', 'drama', 'might', 'evolve', 'none', 'did', 'fact', 'sheriff', 'were', 'not', 'involved', 'film', 'Go', 'ahead', 'call', 'heads', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'let', 'live', 'Much', 'script', ""'mumbo"", 'jumbo', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Chigurh', 'character', 'supernatural', 'terminator-nothing', 'can', 'stop', 'film', 'custom', 'made', 'young', 'American', 'Male', 'who', 'masculinity', 'size', 'gun', 's', 'own', 'sexual', 'inadequacies', 'gun', 'manufacturers', 'must', 'had', 'supporting', 'role', 'list', 'gun', 'nuts', 'sorry', 'gun', 'aficionados', 'Nickel', 'Plated', 'M1911A1', 'Pistol', 'black', 'grips-.45', 'ACP', 'Colt', '1911', 'Series', '70', '.45', 'ACP', 'Smith', 'Wesson', 'Model', '13', '4-inch', 'barrel', '.357', 'Magnum', 'Glock', '19', '2nd', 'Generation', '9x19mm', 'Star', 'Model', 'P', '.45', 'ACP', 'Heckler', 'Koch', 'SP89', 'pistol', 'factory', '15rd', 'magazine', '9mm-Machine', 'Gun', 'Intratec', 'TEC-DC9', '9mm', 'MAC-10', '.45', 'ACP', 'Uzi', 'SMG', '9x19mm', 'Cobray', 'M11/9', '9x19mm', 'Norinco', 'Type', '56', 'fixed', 'stock', 'variant', '7.62x39mm', 'Norinco', 'Type', '56-1', 'under-folding', 'stock', 'variant', '7.62x39mm', 'A', 'Norinco', 'Type', '56', 'AK-47', 'Type', '56-1', 'AKS-47/AKMS', 'Remington', '700', 'rifle', 'probably', '30', 'Cal', 'w/', 'scope', 'Winchester', 'Model', '1897', 'Sawn-off', 'version', 'carrying', 'small', 'duffle', 'bag', '00', 'Buck', 'Shells', 'Remington', '11-87', 'shotgun', '12', 'Gauge', 'w/', 'Suppressor.Finally', 'Coup', 'grace-', 'Pneumatic', 'High', 'Pressure', 'Captive', 'Bolt', 'Pistol', 'bolt', 'brains', 'cattle', 'oops', 'mean', 'humans', 'stun', 'slaughter', 'However', 'Captive', 'Bolt', 'highly', 'lethal', 'when', 'muzzle', 'pressed', 'forehead', 'human', 'being', 'one', 'very', 'graphic', 'scene', 'Chigurh', 'victim', 'be', 'still', 'can', 'line', 'up', 'Captive', 'Bolt', 'Gun', 'trigger', 'mechanism', 'actuated', 'when', 'muzzle', 'pressed', 'head.In', 'event', 'hope', 'have', 'swayed', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'fascinated', 'squirting', 'blood', 'horrific', 'gun', 'carnage', 'see', 'despicable', 'film', 'can', 'always', 'visit', 'slaughter', 'houses', 'instead', 'satisfy', 'primitive', 'urge', 'see', 'guns', 'blood', 'death', 'carnage', 'color', 'live', 'action', 'so', 'speak', ""'m"", 'old', 'man', 'been', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'war', 'saw', 'enough', 'death', 'blood', 'film', 'disgusted', 'most', 'part', 'when', 'portraying', 'anything', 'close', 'real', 'life', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'bad', 'job', 'film']",N/A

I am concerned that the ending of No Country seems to have been heavily edited -- in fact it is suspiciously non-violent compared with the rest of the film. I actually missed the demise of a major character and had to re-watch the ending on DVD to fully comprehend it. I suspect that there was more to the film's end and I hope that there is a director's cut sometime in the future. No Country also lacks a musical score -- prepare yourself as the silence is sometimes deafening.Kudos to the actors -- Bardim, Jones and Brolin. They are magnificent. However, the Coen brothers have been more creative in the past -- Fargo and O Brother Where Art Thou come to mind, among others.Fargo (Special Edition)O Brother, Where Art Thou?.As a West Texan, I must compliment the cinematography in No Country. It was stunning. If you are looking for another truly great film set in West Texas I recommend The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada directed by Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.

85424,A18758S1PUYIDT,0788882988,Viva,"[2, 4]","The whole time I was watching this in the theatre, the other viewers barely made a sound; we were all mesmerized by the story and characters.  This says a lot for the writer, directors, actors and others involved.  The film is not as quirky as the Coens' previous work, but then, it's not that kind of tale.  It almost plays out in some ways like a classic Western, but is set in 1980 and does not give us easy resolutions. For this reason, some will complain that the ending isn't satisfying because it does not tie up all loose ends, because the villain walks away, because so many others die even if they were innocent and weren't involved in any crimes.I found the ending quite refreshing, however.  This is not formula.  This is how things often happen in real life, which is messy and can cause a lot of disillusionment.This connects to the sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones, who comes to realize that he cannot stop what is going to happen no matter what he does, and that he is no longer able to deal with the modern world, which is very different from the world he grew up in (apparently, everything went down the tubes when people stopped saying ""sir"" and ""ma'am"").  That's where the title comes from:  it's not a world that people of his generation can inhabit any longer, and the existential crisis and realization cause him to retire.On to the performances:  aside from the rock-solid Jones, we have Javier Bardem, the coolly eerie, unblinking psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh, who can kill with an oxygen tank without ever beating people over the head with it, but who tries to keep from stepping in blood.  And there is the superb Josh Brolin as Llewellyn Moss, a man who makes the fatal error of trying to take a large sum of money that he never should have touched in the first place.The almost complete lack of music during the movie contributes to the creepiness factor as well, as does the desolate yet somehow beautiful landscape.Look for nominations next year.",5,"Unconventional, unpredictable, and riveting",1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,1983,"['whole', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'theatre', 'other', 'viewers', 'barely', 'made', 'sound', 'were', 'mesmerized', 'story', 'characters', 'lot', 'writer', 'directors', 'actors', 'others', 'involved', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'quirky', 'Coens', 'previous', 'work', 'then', 'not', 'kind', 'tale', 'almost', 'out', 'ways', 'classic', 'Western', 'set', '1980', 'not', 'give', 'easy', 'resolutions', 'reason', 'will', 'complain', 'ending', ""n't"", 'satisfying', 'not', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'villain', 'away', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'die', 'even', 'were', 'innocent', 'were', ""n't"", 'involved', 'crimes.I', 'found', 'ending', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'however', 'not', 'formula', 'how', 'things', 'often', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'messy', 'can', 'cause', 'lot', 'disillusionment.This', 'connects', 'sheriff', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'realize', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'matter', 'what', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'deal', 'modern', 'world', 'very', 'different', 'world', 'grew', 'up', 'apparently', 'everything', 'went', 'tubes', 'when', 'people', 'stopped', 'saying', 'sir', ""ma'am"", 'where', 'title', 'not', 'world', 'people', 'generation', 'can', 'inhabit', 'longer', 'existential', 'crisis', 'realization', 'cause', 'retire.On', 'performances', 'aside', 'rock-solid', 'Jones', 'have', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'coolly', 'eerie', 'unblinking', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'who', 'can', 'kill', 'oxygen', 'tank', 'ever', 'beating', 'people', 'head', 'who', 'keep', 'stepping', 'blood', 'superb', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Llewellyn', 'Moss', 'man', 'who', 'fatal', 'error', 'trying', 'take', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'touched', 'first', 'place.The', 'almost', 'complete', 'lack', 'music', 'movie', 'creepiness', 'factor', 'well', 'desolate', 'yet', 'somehow', 'beautiful', 'landscape.Look', 'nominations', 'year']",N/A

85428,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0788882988,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 8]","*In a nutshell: A chase film involving, drugs, money and murder.* Looks superb*Three featurettes on the making of the film while it isn't bare bones, it deserves better and more special features.*Try to get it as inexpensive as possible because the Oscar win leads me to believe a DOUBLE DIP will be coming later.*Won't be everyone's cup of tea but for those who enjoy the work of the Coens this is an exceptional film.A reflection on mortality, evil and how we can lose our place in the world is the focus of the Coen brothers film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. While set in 1980, the film really (like all films set in the past or future) is really about the average person copes in a world where the rules have changed so rapidly its as if the rug of reality has been pulled out from under us. It's about the changing landscape around us and how we adjust to the brutality that hides beneath the social veneer around us.In some respects ""No Country for Old Men"" reminds me of a horror film crossed with a modern day western (something the Coens suggest themselves in the extras).SOME MINOR SPOILERS:When Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles over the bodies of drug dealers and cash this Vietnam vet realizes that he's hit the mother lode; no one survived and no one will miss the money. Leaving the drugs, Moss makes off with the cash. When psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Academy Award winner Javier Bardem creating the most chilling character since Hannibal Lecter) begins leaving a trail of bodies in pursuit of Moss, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is drawn into the case trying to figure out what happened and try and help Moss before Chigurh catches up to him.Filled with memorable performances particularly from Brolin and a world weary performance by Jones, ""No Country for Old Men"" provides the perfect vehicle for the Coens to continue to mine the themes from previous films enrich and add depth to them. As the title implies Bell realizes that he's a man out of time; the world has changed and all his values no longer seem to be the basis for society, behavior and his reality. Chigurh something totally out of Sheriff Bell's experience--a psychopath with his own bizarre moral code who appears to be the devil incarnate punishing those he perceives to have crossed that moral code and often leaving the outcome of his encounters to the randomness of destiny represented by the coin toss he uses to often decide his victim's fate. As Bell learns, however, the violence has always been around him and has seeped into the very ground of the country he love so much but he's at a loss with how to deal with the blunt brutality that is engulfing his world where people had at least the trappings of civilization.As with ""Fargo"" and ""Blood Simple"" the film is a mixture of grim reality and black humor with the latter providing a counterpoint to the few scenes of relentless and brutal violence that Chigurh unleases.END OF SPOILERS:The DVD version of ""No Country for Old Men"" captures the superb photography of Academy Award nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins (who lost probably due to multiple nominations this year). His sweeping involving camera work captures the empty vistas of Texas creating the sense that Bell and others are trapped in something of a no man's land (or Hell...you can interpret it a number of ways). The muted vistas are perfectly rendered in both the DVD and Blu-ray with sharper image quality and detail in the latter particularly during the night scenes.The 5.1 audio mix deftly incorporates the ambience of the vast undeveloped land that surrounds our characters and comes to life brutally as action scenes are unleashed.As with most Coen films that appear on home video, there's no commentary track (although cinematographer Roger Deakins would have been welcomed).  We do, however, get three long featurettes on the making of the film. Although I suspect we'll see a double dip at some point in the future due to the Oscars the film won, the featurettes really don't do enough to provide us with information on the making of the film compared to many others for lesser films.""The Making of No Country for Old Men runs about a half hour and has a lot of interviews and clips from the film. The most interesting aspect of this is the comments from the Coens who rarely provide us with a lot of insight into their world outside of the film itself.""Working with the Coens"" has interviews with the actors discussing how they work as a team and their impact on their performances. It's an interesting featurette with some incredible insights from Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem.""Diary of a Country Sheriff"" takes into Ed Tom Bell's world via interviews with Barden, Tommy Lee Jones and others. It provides interesting insights into the difficulty the sheriff has in adjusting to this new, bizarre, brutal world order.A superb film that looks marvelous on both DVD and Blu-ray, the only drawback to ""No Country for Old Men"" is the lack of more substantive featurettes, interviews and a commentary track. I can highly recommend this film although I suspect there MIGHT be a double dip down the line (I'm on the fence on this...it needs more but I personally don't want to have to get this twice), this amazing, powerful film remains one of the Coens best since ""Fargo"". Although this film isn't for everyone, those who have seen other Coen films will enjoy this.**If you disagree post a review remember the voting system isn't about whether or not you agree or disagree

85431,A17JVVAKWEB0M,0788882988,Wesley Mullins,"[3, 4]","During their interviews in last year's ""Infamous"", Truman Capote and Harper Lee speak to a grizzled farmer who attended church with the brutally murdered Clutter family. He tells of how the killings scared him and disrupted his view of the world's balance and order.  Despite all the good done by Herb Clutter, when the evil winds blew, they whisked him away like a feather. ""You're in control until you're not in control"", the old man says. ""Then you're helpless.""Such powerlessness in the face of evil echoes through No Country for Old Men, the instant classic from Joel and Ethan Coen. In a quest to recover stolen drug money, evil incarnate (Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem) decimates anything in his way with almost supernatural power.  Bardem's mesmerizing portrayal immediately takes a place next to the quintessential evil men in film history, from Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter to Jack Palance's gunslinger Wilson from Shane.  Yes, he's that good.  In Chigurh's wake is left the bodies of his former colleagues and rivals and an endless string of seemingly good townsfolk who just happened to be in the wrong place when the evil winds came a-blowin'.Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is the object of Chigurh's pursuit. While hunting antelope, Moss discovers the drug money and soon realizes his great fortune comes tethered to an even greater price. The unrelenting, unstoppable Chigurh finds his way to all of Moss hiding spots, always armed with weaponry rivaling in creativity the arsenal of Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle. I'm far from a gun nut, but the two devices of death primarily used by Bardem in this film are flat out cool.The search for Moss and the ensuing body count plays out under the nose of Tommy Lee Jones' aging lawman, the film's conscious and analytic voice. As the man in the best position to save the innocent (and not so innocent) from Bardem's monster, Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell slowly realizes the futility of trying to stop evil. As an old friend and mentor tells him, wickedness has always and will always exist, and anyone who believes they can stop it falls victim to vanity.No Country for Old Men gives this seemingly nihilistic view to its audience, with an ending that will no doubt disappoint those expecting men in white horses to ride in and save the day. In fact, viewers expecting any kind of traditional ending (either good or bad) will find the ambiguous close of this film frustrating. Several people stayed in the theater through the credits when I watched it, as they almost demanded or even willed an additional scene to find its way to the reel.This difficult lack of closure, these frayed knots left untied shouldn't be the film's legacy. Up until the ending, No Country for Old Men gives its viewers a merciless edge-of-your-seat ride, full of some of the most unforgettable characters and scenes in years.  Its heightened sense of drama and tension is unmatched in anything since The Shining.  This film will cause you sleepless nights, as your only comfort will be knowing that you don't have a bag of Anton Chigurh's money, and he's not coming for you.",5,You can't stop what's coming.

85433,A14WCM5XDC1UT3,0788882988,William Capodanno,"[0, 1]","Rarely do a find a movie adaptation of a good novel very appealing.  Quite often, I don't even bother to see the movie since many adaptations are so poorly done and make you forget what a great novel you had read.  I chose to see since this was a Coen brother's film, Tommie Lee Jones playing the role of the aging small Texas sheriff Bell and the great reviews this received.Wow, this is one great movie.  This is not a film for those with a soft stomach for violence.  If you read the book, that would not surprise you.  Violence is not glorified in the picture, but provides the necessary context for the world enveloping early 80s America.  Tommie Lee Jones was brilliant as Sheriff Bell.  He gives an Oscar worthy performance, playing the role perfect subtlety and precision.  Jones commands the screen every time he is on it so it is hard to single any one over the other.  However, his scene in the Diner with Carla Jean is a masterpiece and worth the price of your movie ticket.While Tommie Lee Jones deserves the accolades he's receiving for his performance, Josh Brolin is brilliant as Llewelyn Moss.  He's got that rough, blue collar, down on his luck persona and he uses to perfection.  You empathize with Moss, but know that he is destined for the inevitably of his predicament.  Woody Harrelson also gives a great 15 minute cameo.The one casting mistake in my mind is Javier Bardem as Chigurgh.  While he grew on me in that role as the movie went on, I never quite got over him as a bad cariacture.  At times he inspires absolute terror, but find this is more the case when we don't see him, but are anticipating him (while Moss stares at the hotel room door as Chigurgh approaches or where you see his cattle gun is the focus, not his face).  Don't get me wrong, Bardem gives a solid perforance and I don't think detracts from the picture.  I just felt better casting would have made this great picture even better.The cinematography, location/set design and remaining performances are top notch, with the cinematography requiring viewing in a theater since even a 60"" HD set won't do the panoramic landscape shots justice that the theater do.This is definitely one of the can't miss movies of 2007 and likely to be a top Oscar contender in several categories.",5,"Amazing adaptation, even outshines McCarthy's novel",1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,2275,"['Rarely', 'do', 'find', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'good', 'novel', 'very', 'appealing', 'Quite', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'see', 'movie', 'many', 'adaptations', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'done', 'make', 'forget', 'what', 'great', 'novel', 'had', 'read', 'chose', 'see', 'was', 'Coen', 'brother', 'film', 'Tommie', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'playing', 'role', 'aging', 'small', 'Texas', 'sheriff', 'Bell', 'great', 'reviews', 'received.Wow', 'one', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'film', 'soft', 'stomach', 'violence', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'not', 'surprise', 'Violence', 'not', 'glorified', 'picture', 'necessary', 'context', 'world', 'enveloping', 'early', '80s', 'America', 'Tommie', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Sheriff', 'Bell', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'playing', 'role', 'perfect', 'subtlety', 'precision', 'Jones', 'screen', 'time', 'hard', 'single', 'one', 'other', 'However', 'scene', 'Diner', 'Carla', 'Jean', 'masterpiece', 'price', 'movie', 'Tommie', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'accolades', 'receiving', 'performance', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'brilliant', 'Llewelyn', 'Moss', 'got', 'rough', 'blue', 'collar', 'down', 'luck', 'persona', 'perfection', 'empathize', 'Moss', 'know', 'destined', 'inevitably', 'predicament', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'also', 'great', '15', 'minute', 'cameo.The', 'one', 'casting', 'mistake', 'mind', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Chigurgh', 'grew', 'role', 'movie', 'went', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'over', 'bad', 'cariacture', 'times', 'absolute', 'terror', 'find', 'more', 'case', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'are', 'anticipating', 'Moss', 'stares', 'hotel', 'room', 'door', 'Chigurgh', 'where', 'see', 'cattle', 'gun', 'focus', 'not', 'face', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Bardem', 'solid', 'perforance', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'detracts', 'picture', 'just', 'felt', 'better', 'casting', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'picture', 'even', 'better.The', 'cinematography', 'design', 'remaining', 'performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'cinematography', 'requiring', 'viewing', 'theater', 'even', '60', 'HD', 'set', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'panoramic', 'landscape', 'shots', 'justice', 'theater', 'do.This', 'definitely', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'movies', '2007', 'likely', 'be', 'top', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'several', 'categories']",N/A
85434,ARFCORBCTKX1J,0788882988,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[0, 6]","""Citizen Kane"" is what I call a ""movie movie"". That is, it is as much about the /process/ of film-making as it is about telling a story. We are very much aware of the film on both levels -- tale-telling plus movies-as-artifice.The Coen brothers often make such films. This style can work well, when the story is strong enough, and they minimize their tendency to cruelly caricature people, or turn up their noses at ""hicks"" who never went to college. * It also works when they perfectly mimic a literary style (""Raising Arizona"").Despite the brothers' claim that ""No Country for Old Men"" is unlike anything they've done, it's obviously a rehash of ""Fargo"", and inferior hash, at that. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin play intelligent, appealing people, and Javier Bardem's turn as a psychotic murderer with a terrible haircut is frighteningly good, but the rest of the characters are mostly dull-witted boobs.In short, ""Fargo"" /works/, while ""No Country for Old Men"" is little more than an exercise in style, one that we've seen too often. ""Fargo"" skates dangerously close to the thin ice of the Coens' trademark style (how's that for a metaphor?), but succeeds, because, despite the Coens' tendency to hold their characters at an emotional arm's length, all have recongnizable personalities & problems, and are not merely caricatures or types. And though Marge starts off as a funny-talking buffoon, we are won over by her intelligence, dedication, and (at the end) her sincere and forthright expression of what is and isn't right.Ultimately, we are /involved/ with ""Fargo""'s characters. ""No Country for Old Men"" isn't much more than clever writing and good acting. It's a technically well-made film, and little else.Just to clarify a point... I am an intellectual, I like intellecutal things, and I have no fundamental problem with the Coens' ""intellectual"" approach to film-making. But you cannot tell stories about ""ideas"", only about people. When you reduce people to shallow caricatures, you lose the ability to connect with the audience, which is the reason for making the film in the first place.I think I'll stop by the library and borrow the book. I suspect it's a lot better.----------Here's my book report. (I might post an extended review of the book, but don't know right now. If you're interested, click on ""see all my reviews"" and browse.)On the surface, ""No Country for Old Men"" has ""Coen brothers movie"" written all over it. It's shot through with acidly black humor and a generally dismal view of (some parts of) humanity. To my surprise, all but two or three lines of dialog were lifted directly from the book, including the following from Sheriff Bell (TLJ):""Here last week they found this couple out in California they would rent out rooms to old people and then kill em and bury em in the yard and cash their social security checks. They'd torture em first, I dont know why. Maybe their television was broke.""That's not Joel and Ethan -- that's Cormac. (So is the idiosyncratic use of apostrophes and the failure to capitalize proper nouns.)The problem is that, in passing McCarthy's Coen-flavored story through the Coen's own filter, the Coen-ish elements are emphasized at the expense of the McCarthy-ish. The film is primarily a crime drama with an icing of social commentary, whereas the book uses the crime as a hook to hang the commentary on. The film doesn't ignore the philosophy/perspective/insight (whatever you want to call it), it's just that they take a back seat to the sorts of weirdness and grotesquerie that appeal to the Coens.The process of converting ""No Country for Old Men"" to a film both amplifies and diminishes the book. The amplification lies mainly in hearing fine actors deliver the lines. The diminution lies in the Coen's failure to clearly dramatize the book's reason for being -- an attack on the gross materialism of American society. The film shows what is easy to show -- the physical activity of the chase -- and pays less attention to the characters' inner lives -- which is not the Coen brothers' ""style"", and would kindly bring the film to a dead stop, anyway.The Coens are not known for their ""humanity"", and the relatively thin treatment of Llewelyn's and Ball's marriages -- both happy ones -- hurts the film, because it largely lacks a ""humane center"" against which to play the utter evil of the story. The story of Carla Jean's belief about how, when she started working at Walmart, she knew she would there meet the man she was destined to spend her life with -- which she does -- is not only poignant, but perversely justifies Chigurh's claim that everything she has done in her life has inevitably led to his murdering her. Yet it is omitted in the film.However entertaining ""No Country for Old Men"" is (and it is highly entertaining), it is a poor adaptation of an outstanding novel. The Coen brothers are hardly the first directors to take what they like from a story and leave behind what is truly important, and will not be the last.As odd as it sounds, if you're interested in reading the novel (and I can't recommend it highly enough), see the film first. This sequence throws what is so good about the book into sharp relief.PS: As a degreed EE, and licensed Amateur operator (KA3QXL), I have to point out that, once the transponder was placed in the air duct, its output would be shielded to the point where you'd be hard-pressed to pick it up even a few feet away. Indeed, even if it had been sitting on the floor in the motel room, it's unlikely it could have been picked up from the highway, especially with the interrogating transmitter sitting on the car's seat, where its signal would be blocked by the door.",3,a disappointing diminution...,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,5692,"['Citizen', 'Kane', 'what', 'call', 'movie', 'movie', 'as', 'much',

85435,A23IOPI0D1OG7V,0788882988,"WILLIE A YOUNG II ""willow""","[1, 3]","""No Country..."" is terrific for a number of reasons but the thing that stands out most to me is....silence. There's no cheesy incidental music score to intrude on the story and cue viewers on when to feel tension, sorrow or fear, it just tells the story and that makes it a masterpiece, plain and simple, deep and true. The cast is stellar from top to bottom (congrats to Javier Bardem on a much deserved Oscar win!) but special notice goes to Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss whose performance is, in my opinion, the heart of this movie.

All the pseudo intellectual babble aside, I found this an empty cinematic experience with many questions left unanswered and not so much by the anti-climactic and abrupt ending but pretty much by everything that preceded it.  And allow me to get this out of the way, I think Javier Bardem is a first rate actor but this was the most undeserving Oscar since Kim Basinger in L.A. Confidential and, sadly, it has nothing to do with his performance as much as it does with a character that is seemingly nothing more than a killing machine and little else.  It was a one dimensional character played accordingly by Bardem.  The one thing about his past that we may glean is that he was, perhaps, at one time either a doctor or a medical student, judging by the expert way he chose medication and anesthesia and tended to his bullet wound.One review of his performance states the following: ""Javier Bardem's personification of psychotic evil fills the screen with an unflinching power -- it's as impossible for the audience to look away from him as it is for his victims to get away from him.""Give me a major break!!!!!!!!!!  I could fill the screen just as well if the cameras were focused on me continuously and I was slaughtering the greater populace of Southwestern Texas with unbridled tenacity.  It's mind-numbing and moronic reviews such as the aforementioned that have given this film (and Bardem's performance) the kind of relevance and undeserved fawning that it has received.  What?  Because the toss of the coin determines the fate of his possible victims, we're supposed to think ""Oh wow, how brooding and psychotic this character is and how profound Bardem's portrayal.""There were a few other things that I found downright strange, putting all philosophical musings to rest for a moment.  When Llewelyn stumbles upon the massacre of the drug dealers, he didn't react at all, as if though seeing bloody bodies strewn across the desert were as common as sand. I know he's a Vietnam vet, hardened and considerably emotionally detached, but his seeming indifference verged on pathological.  And if he is supposed to be seen as the other side of the Anton coin, then he would never have gone back with a gallon of water for the sole survivor of the slaughter who had begged him for some.  He would have just taken the money, allowed the survivor to die an agonizing death and taken off somewhere and I don't mean a motel in the neighboring town; I mean Ecuador or Norway or wherever.  It was like playing hide-and-go-seek and hiding in between the seekers legs and not expect to be caught.Another thing, this film takes place in 1980 (and I know that from the novel, as the film leaves this point ambiguous), yet Carson Wells, in his attempt to save his own hide, offers to take Anton to an ATM so that he may withdraw and give him, if I remember correctly $14,000.00.  First things first - ATM's did not become part of mainstream banking until the mid to late 1980's and secondly, what ATM, even today, allows one to withdraw that sum of money?  I doubt that in a border town in rural Texas, they were readily available.  Furthermore, when Carson saw the case of money on the river bank, why in God's name didn't he just take it and get back to the person who hired him to retrieve it in the first place instead of just leaving it there and going back to the hotel?Now that I've gotten the complaints out of the way, allow me to state that it is not a dismal a film as some have indicated.  Its production value are first rate and the performances are uniformly very good; however, Bardem's is not better than Jones's, Brolin's or Kelly MacDonald's (her efforts, I feel, were underrated).  There are some exciting set pieces and it's not remotely boring as others have mentioned and though the film has depth and the morality tale is evident, it is not, I repeat, deserving of cinema's highest honor.",2,Disappointed and surprised,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,4010,"[""'m"", 'loath', 'give', 'film', 'technical', 'achievement', 'one', 'star', 'however', 'two', 'most', 'can', 'give', 'pseudo', 'intellectual', 'babble', 'aside', 'found', 'empty', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'many', 'questions', 'left', 'unanswered', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'anti-climactic', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'preceded', 'allow', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'think', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'first', 'rate', 'actor', 'was', 'most', 'undeserving', 'Oscar', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'sadly', 'nothing', 'do', 'performance', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'seemingly', 'nothing', 'more', 'killing', 'machine', 'little', 'else', 'was', 'one', 'dimensional', 'character', 'played', 'accordingly', 'Bardem', 'one', 'thing', 'past', 'may', 'glean', 'was', 'perhaps', 'one', 'time', 'doctor', 'medical', 'student', 'judging', 'expert', 'way', 'chose', 'medication', 'anesthesia', 'tended', 'bullet', 'wound.One', 'review', 'performance', 'following', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'personification', 'psychotic', 'evil', 'screen', 'unflinching', 'power', 'impossible', 'audience', 'look', 'away', 'victims', 'get', 'away', 'Give', 'major', 'break', 'could', 'fill', 'screen', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'cameras', 'were', 'focused', 'continuously', 'was', 'slaughtering', 'greater', 'populace', 'Southwestern', 'Texas', 'unbridled', 'tenacity', 'mind-numbing', 'moronic', 'reviews', 'such', 'aforementioned', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'Bardem', 'performance', 'kind', 'relevance', 'undeserved', 'fawning', 'received', 'What', 'toss', 'coin', 'fate', 'possible', 'victims', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'Oh', 'wow', 'how', 'brooding', 'psychotic', 'character', 'how', 'profound', 'Bardem', 'portrayal', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'found', 'downright', 'strange', 'putting', 'philosophical', 'musings', 'rest', 'moment', 'When', 'Llewelyn', 'massacre', 'drug', 'dealers', 'did', ""n't"", 'react', 'seeing', 'bloody', 'bodies', 'strewn', 'desert', 'were', 'as', 'common', 'sand', 'know', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'hardened', 'considerably', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'seeming', 'indifference', 'verged', 'pathological', 'supposed', 'be', 'seen', 'other', 'side', 'Anton', 'coin', 'then', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'gallon', 'water', 'sole', 'survivor', 'slaughter', 'who', 'had', 'begged', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'taken', 'money', 'allowed', 'survivor', 'die', 'agonizing', 'death', 'taken', 'off', 'somewhere', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'motel', 'neighboring', 'town', 'mean', 'Ecuador', 'Norway', 'wherever', 'was', 'playing', 'hide-and-go-seek', 'hiding', 'seekers', 'legs', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'caught.Another', 'thing', 'film', 'place', '1980', 'know', 'novel', 'film', 'point', 'ambiguous', 'yet', 'Carson', 'Wells', 'attempt', 'save', 'own', 'hide', 'take', 'Anton', 'ATM', 'so', 'may', 'withdraw', 'give', 'remember', 'correctly', '14,000.00', 'First', 'things', 'first', 'ATM', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'part', 'mainstream', 'banking', 'mid', 'late', '1980', 'secondly', 'what', 'ATM', 'even', 'today', 'one', 'withdraw', 'sum', 'money', 'doubt', 'border', 'town', 'rural', 'Texas', 'were', 'readily', 'available', 'Furthermore', 'when', 'Carson', 'saw', 'case', 'money', 'river', 'bank', 'why', 'God', 'name', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'get', 'back', 'person', 'who', 'hired', 'retrieve', 'first', 'place', 'instead', 'just', 'leaving', 'going', 'back', 'hotel', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'complaints', 'way', 'allow', 'state', 'not', 'dismal', 'film', 'have', 'indicated', 'production', 'value', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'very', 'good', 'however', 'Bardem', 'not', 'better', 'Jones', 'Brolin', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'efforts', 'feel', 'were', 'underrated', 'are', 'exciting', 'set', 'pieces', 'not', 'remotely', 'boring', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'film', 'depth', 'morality', 'tale', 'evident', 'not', 'repeat', 'deserving', 'cinema', 'highest', 'honor']",N/A

(They even nicked the title of the movie from the poem ""Sailing to Byzantium"" by W. B. Yeats. I'd recommend reading that poem to seeing this movie.) Maybe so many Oscars were given to this because Hollywood has finally figured out that these guys can't seem to make any other kind of movie?How many Coen movies in a row now in which the setting is inevitably a picturesque part of America? But wait, there's an underlying sinister quality; we find that's because there are white people lurking about, made to look, at best, inept and impotent, and at worst murderous psychopaths. Seriously, let's celebrate diversity!I watched this all the way through and enjoyed the performance of Josh Brolin and a few other cast members. I found Javier Bardem's performance no more extraordinary than what William Hurt (who has given many zombie-like performances) could have delivered. Of course Javier has ""the hair"" - one of many things (grates, ashtrays, white trash) the Coens fetishize here.Really, it's hard to tell whether Bardem's performance is out of the ordinary, never mind extraordinary. His character does not evolve from a scary golem with a weird haircut. On the contrary, his psychopathic predictability gets tiring.In fact, the entire movie nearly becomes unglued during the scene where ""mama"" is being driven to a secret location. The dark humor becomes wearing at that point.Finally, this movie should have ended when (SPOILER ALERT) the sheriff (played by Tommy Lee Jones) returns at night to a motel crime scene, knowing that the killer is somewhere in the motel, yet ultimately deciding that impending retirement is not worth the risk of flushing out a serial killer.Instead, as Josh and Javier frequently do throughout, the movie limps along, so we get to hear the sheriff opine about the bleak nature of existence, and a kind of cosmic justice is (almost) delivered to the golem. Almost.

When Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds a briefcase full of money meant for Chigurh, it kicks off a tense chase between all three parties.The reason ""No Country For Old Men"" is such a solid film is because it is so deep on a number of different yellows.  All three main characters are interesting and make you truly care (one way or another) about their actions, especially the viciousness of Anton (that is probably the one aspect of the movie I will always remember).Despite the fact that this is a very deep, thought-provoking movie, it is also quite sparse and terse (perhaps more sparse than any movie I've ever seen).  There is no dramatic music (no contrived drama whatsoever, to be honest), no montage sequences, no character flashbacks, or any bells-and-whistles.  It is completely ""straight down the line"", so to speak.  If you are a fan of that type of stark filmmaking, this will be one of your all-time favorite.All told, I enjoyed watching this movie for the amount of themes it threw at me and particularly the way it portrayed the ""new type of killer"" in the modern world (even in the more traditional Texas).

85445,AKK49Y5DWSEND,0788882988,ZombieLuv,"[1, 2]","First off, let me say that this is NOT my kind of movie.  I'm more into zombies, slashers, and movies of the horror genre.  My Husband is into the same genre as myself but once he saw bits of this movie on PPV he figured we'd enjoy it to some degree since it had guns, murder, and all that kind of stuff, HE WAS RIGHT!  I'll also say, yes, it does have violence but it offers SO MUCH MORE.  I REALLY enjoyed this film.It takes you back to 1980, a MUCH simpler time, yet a time of enormous change.  The entire movie was symbolic (to me.)  There were many parts that IMO, showed the contrast of good and evil, and the times changing ever so much.Bottom line, the movie was made well, no Hollywood bologna effects etc.. The acting was great, BRAVO!  The plot was very entertaining/realistic and kept my attention 100%.  The movie overall was fantastic.  If you like explosives, crazy car chases, women with obvious breast implants, sex scenes aplenty, goofy acting, poor plot, and special effects to fill in the gap for the lack of a thought provocing scipt, then this movie is NOT for you.  If you're looking for GREAT simple yet strong type of movie with a big message and awesome plot, you've found the right movie for you.",5,You stand to win everything....,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,1223,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'NOT', 'kind', 'movie', ""'m"", 'more', 'zombies', 'slashers', 'movies', 'horror', 'genre', 'Husband', 'same', 'genre', 'once', 'saw', 'bits', 'movie', 'PPV', 'figured', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'degree', 'had', 'guns', 'murder', 'kind', 'stuff', 'HE', 'WAS', 'RIGHT', ""'ll"", 'also', 'say', 'yes', 'have', 'violence', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'MORE', 'REALLY', 'enjoyed', 'film.It', 'back', '1980', 'MUCH', 'simpler', 'time', 'yet', 'time', 'enormous', 'change', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'symbolic', 'were', 'many', 'parts', 'IMO', 'showed', 'contrast', 'good', 'evil', 'times', 'changing', 'ever', 'so', 'much.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'well', 'Hollywood', 'bologna', 'effects', 'etc..', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'BRAVO', 'plot', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining/realistic', 'kept', 'attention', '100', '%', 'movie', 'overall', 'was', 'fantastic', 'like', 'explosives', 'crazy', 'car', 'chases', 'women', 'obvious', 'breast', 'implants', 'sex', 'scenes', 'aplenty', 'goofy', 'acting', 'poor', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'fill', 'gap', 'lack', 'thought', 'provocing', 'scipt', 'then', 'movie', 'NOT', ""'re"", 'looking', 'GREAT', 'simple', 'yet', 'strong', 'type', 'movie', 'big', 'message', 'awesome', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'found', 'right', 'movie']",N/A

Thank goodness for $1.00 rentals. ""No Country For Old Men"" (what does that mean anyways?) didn't live up to my expectations.  Because I love ""Fargo"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", I thought this latest installment of a Coen Brothers film would blow me away.  The film just got too evil for me and too creepy.  The characters were bizarre and reprehensible so I wasn't too interested in the story that went along with it.  I like Josh Brolin, he was the best part of the movie for me.  Javier Bardem's character just creeped me out in a bad way, maybe it was the hair, who knows.  The quirkiness of The Coen Brothers films was missing here and when the characters tried to be quirky, it didn't work in that genuine way.  Like why the scene with the teenage boys selling their shirt?  That scene was borderline inappropriate, like we need to see a shirtless teenage boy, the movie could of done without.  The scenes with Tommy Lee Jones bored me to tears and then out of nowhere the movie stopped.  Credits rolled and I just chalked it up as a loss.  Very dissapointed. Now I wish Hal Holbrook would have won the oscar for supporting actor, and ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""Into The Wild"" should have won for best picture.
