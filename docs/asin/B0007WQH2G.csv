892876,A2I8GYSHJTWU1A,B0007WQH2G,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","I bought this set years ago, with the thought that I would watch it ""someday when I have time.""  Well, someday came a couple of weeks ago and I popped in disc 1, and wondered why they never addressed all the Jump Street cops coming back after their spring breakup and the cliffhanger that was left at the end of season 2.  Oh, well, I guess they just don't bring it up.  Watched disc 2, still enjoying.  Put in disc 3, and wondered how I managed to get mixed up and put disc 1 in again.  Hm, says disc 3 on it.  That's a problem, looked at disc 1 again, and realized that discs 3 and 4 were in the cover for both discs 1 and 2 and the cover for discs 3 and 4.  Now, it is well beyond any reasonable time frame that I would bother contacting amazon to replace this, as I said I bought it years ago, so I contacted the manufacturer, Anchor Bay.  Their only response was, sorry, we don't have the rights to this anymore, and no, we won't tell you who does so you can contact someone who can help you.So in summation, the show (well, the episodes that I could watch anyway) were good, the reason for two stars instead of one.  On the other hand, the manufacturer, Anchor Bay, well, it wouldn't be polite to say what I think of them.ps, even though Anchor Bay claims to no longer have the rights to this product, Anchor Bay Entertainment is still listed as the manufacturer on Amazon's website.",2,"rating is 90% based on discs, not show itself",1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,1389,"['bought', 'set', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'would', 'watch', 'someday', 'when', 'have', 'time', 'Well', 'someday', 'came', 'couple', 'weeks', 'popped', 'disc', '1', 'wondered', 'why', 'never', 'addressed', 'Jump', 'Street', 'cops', 'coming', 'back', 'spring', 'breakup', 'cliffhanger', 'was', 'left', 'end', 'season', '2', 'Oh', 'well', 'guess', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'up', 'Watched', 'disc', '2', 'still', 'enjoying', 'Put', 'disc', '3', 'wondered', 'how', 'managed', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'put', 'disc', '1', 'again', 'Hm', 'disc', '3', 'problem', 'looked', 'disc', '1', 'again', 'realized', 'discs', '3', '4', 'were', 'cover', 'discs', '1', '2', 'cover', 'discs', '3', '4', 'Now', 'well', 'reasonable', 'time', 'frame', 'would', 'bother', 'contacting', 'amazon', 'replace', 'said', 'bought', 'years', 'ago', 'contacted', 'manufacturer', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'only', 'response', 'was', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'rights', 'anymore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'so', 'can', 'contact', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'you.So', 'summation', 'show', 'well', 'episodes', 'could', 'watch', 'anyway', 'were', 'good', 'reason', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'other', 'hand', 'manufacturer', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'well', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'polite', 'say', 'what', 'think', 'them.ps', 'even', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'longer', 'have', 'rights', 'product', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'still', 'listed', 'manufacturer', 'Amazon', 'website']",21 Jump Street - The Complete Third Season
892877,AZXNBK1K43Y69,B0007WQH2G,audreylynn,"[13, 16]","I adore both the first and second season of Jump Street, so obviously I couldn't wait until this one came to DVD. Unfortunately, I'm not quite as impressed with this season.I found there to be some problems with the third season of 21 Jump Street. Here are just couple of them:1) Johnny Depp intensely disliked the show, and desperately wanted out of his contract. He was tired of being labeled as a teenage ""heartthrob"", and so he didn't put as much effort into his acting. He even offered to do a season free if Fox would let him out of his contract. Because of his lack of enthusiasm, Depp isn't included in this season nearly as much. However, there are a few episodes in which Depp reportedly expressed interest in the script, so he actually attempted (and succeeded) to give a brilliant performance.2) Although there are a few that are decent, most of the episodes are somewhat boring and cheesy. One example of this would be the episode called ""Woolly Bullies."" It's about Penhall and some bully troubles he's having, and the rest of the episode includes flashbacks of each of the Jump Street members' childhood bully experiences.  One good thing about this episode is the guest appearance by Peter DeLuise's father and brother. Another disappointing episode is ""What About Love?"" where Officer Hoffs discovers she's been sleeping with a married man. There is one scene where a sad song is playing while the screen is showing Judy walking around in slow motion looking sad...for a lengthy three minutes! It literally seems like they ran out of good material to use.Despite these problems, there are a couple of extremely good episodes. ""Hell Week"" is an enjoyable episode about fraternities and hazing. One episode, in particular, is probably Johnny Depp's best performance of the entire show. It's called ""Swallowed Alive"". In this episode, Hanson and Penhall go undercover as inmates in a juvenile prison in order to find out how heroin is getting in the prison. After a bloody fight, Hanson becomes the ""Hammer"" (the guy in charge), while Penhall is shipped off to a psychiatric facility after being locked up in solitary confinement (because of his claustrophobia). Hanson is all alone, and he contemplates the fact that everyone he has busted in the past ends up in this prison, which he considers Hell. This episode is Depp's most emotional performance, and the story is intriguing and suspensful.So, if it hadn't been for the couple of good episodes, I would have given this season 2 or 3 stars. It is still a marvelous show, and all the characters are thoroughly enjoyable, especially Penhall (who is hilarious, as usual) and Captain Fuller. If you enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, you will most likely find this one entertaining as well. I just found a few episodes to be a little uninspiring.",4,"Still a great show, but a few episodes are disappointing",1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,2801,"['adore', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'Jump', 'Street', 'so', 'obviously', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'one', 'came', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'impressed', 'season.I', 'found', 'be', 'problems', 'third', 'season', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'Here', 'are', 'just', 'couple', 'them:1', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'intensely', 'disliked', 'show', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'contract', 'was', 'tired', 'being', 'labeled', 'teenage', 'heartthrob', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'as', 'much', 'effort', 'acting', 'even', 'offered', 'do', 'season', 'free', 'Fox', 'would', 'let', 'contract', 'lack', 'enthusiasm', 'Depp', ""n't"", 'included', 'season', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'Depp', 'reportedly', 'expressed', 'interest', 'script', 'actually', 'attempted', 'succeeded', 'give', 'brilliant', 'performance.2', 'are', 'few', 'are', 'decent', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'cheesy', 'One', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'episode', 'called', 'Woolly', 'Bullies', 'Penhall', 'bully', 'having', 'rest', 'episode', 'flashbacks', 'Jump', 'Street', 'members', 'childhood', 'bully', 'One', 'good', 'thing', 'episode', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Peter', 'DeLuise', 'father', 'brother', 'disappointing', 'episode', 'What', 'Love', 'where', 'Officer', 'Hoffs', 'been', 'sleeping', 'married', 'man', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'sad', 'song', 'playing', 'screen', 'showing', 'Judy', 'walking', 'around', 'slow', 'motion', 'looking', 'sad', 'lengthy', 'three', 'minutes', 'literally', 'ran', 'good', 'material', 'use.Despite', 'problems', 'are', 'couple', 'extremely', 'good', 'episodes', 'Hell', 'Week', 'enjoyable', 'episode', 'fraternities', 'hazing', 'One', 'episode', 'particular', 'probably', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'best', 'performance', 'entire', 'show', 'called', 'Swallowed', 'Alive', 'episode', 'Hanson', 'Penhall', 'go', 'undercover', 'as', 'inmates', 'juvenile', 'prison', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'heroin', 'getting', 'prison', 'bloody', 'fight', 'Hanson', 'Hammer', 'guy', 'charge', 'Penhall', 'shipped', 'off', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'being', 'locked', 'up', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'claustrophobia', 'Hanson', 'alone', 'fact', 'everyone', 'busted', 'past', 'up', 'prison', 'Hell', 'episode', 'Depp', 'most', 'emotional', 'performance', 'story', 'intriguing', 'suspensful.So', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'couple', 'good', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'season', '2', '3', 'stars', 'still', 'marvelous', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'especially', 'Penhall', 'who', 'hilarious', 'usual', 'Captain', 'Fuller', 'enjoyed', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'find', 'one', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'found', 'few', 'episodes', 'be', 'little', 'uninspiring']",21 Jump Street - The Complete Third Season

892882,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B0007WQH2G,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[31, 35]","Although series creator and executive Patrick Hasburgh was gone by this season, episodes throughout continued to hold viewer intrigue.Richard Grieco joined 21 Jump Street as Dennis ""Booker"" Booker. Booker is initially challenged by Hansen in the episode ""Fun with animals"" at the start of this 20 episode season (1988-1989). Booker's racist attitudes have inevitably lead Hansen to deduct that this new colleague must have raped a black student. Booker was supposed to have been killed at the end of this same season, but was later spun off into a very short-lived show called ""Booker"".Another serious episode is ""The currency we trade in"". A popular sportswriter is suspected of being a child molestor by his ex wife. Penhall's subsequent belief of those same allegations complicates that writer's public life.In ""Whose choice is it anyway"" Judy ""Hoffs"" Hoffs goes undercover as a pregnant teen to expose the threats which were being made against a family planning center by anti-abortionists. Before there was a federal law against clinic violence, owners and staff actually were at the mercy of their local law enforcement's priorities. This episode perfectly encapsulates then-present reality without boring the intended target audience.The Jump Street division gets another hefty dose of politics when they attempt to bust the mayor's son for drug dealing. In 'fathers and sons' City Hall responds by trying to control who these cops can legally bust. The Jump Street cops are doing the right thing unless their actions hit too close to home.Home is a visible theme throughout this season. Officer Harry ""Ioki"" Ioki (played by real life immigrant Dustin Nguyen) is an 'American cop' but continues to wrestle with Vietnam. During ""The dragon and the angel"" he learns of a way to get his grandmother out of Vietnam. After Ioki is seriously wounded in a dramatic two-part season finale ""Loc'd out"", Hanson honestly becomes motivated to seek revenge for that incident.",5,These cops still patrol prime time,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,1969,"['series', 'creator', 'executive', 'Patrick', 'Hasburgh', 'was', 'gone', 'season', 'continued', 'hold', 'viewer', 'intrigue.Richard', 'Grieco', 'joined', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'Dennis', 'Booker', 'Booker', 'Booker', 'initially', 'challenged', 'Hansen', 'episode', 'Fun', 'animals', 'start', '20', 'episode', 'season', '1988-1989', 'Booker', 'racist', 'attitudes', 'have', 'inevitably', 'lead', 'Hansen', 'deduct', 'new', 'colleague', 'must', 'have', 'raped', 'black', 'student', 'Booker', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'end', 'same', 'season', 'was', 'later', 'spun', 'off', 'very', 'short-lived', 'show', 'called', 'Booker', '.Another', 'serious', 'episode', 'currency', 'trade', 'popular', 'sportswriter', 'suspected', 'being', 'child', 'molestor', 'ex', 'wife', 'Penhall', 'subsequent', 'belief', 'same', 'allegations', 'writer', 'public', 'life.In', 'Whose', 'choice', 'anyway', 'Judy', 'Hoffs', 'Hoffs', 'undercover', 'pregnant', 'teen', 'expose', 'threats', 'were', 'being', 'made', 'family', 'planning', 'center', 'anti-abortionists', 'was', 'federal', 'law', 'clinic', 'violence', 'owners', 'staff', 'actually', 'were', 'mercy', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'priorities', 'episode', 'perfectly', 'then-present', 'reality', 'boring', 'intended', 'target', 'audience.The', 'Jump', 'Street', 'division', 'hefty', 'dose', 'politics', 'when', 'attempt', 'bust', 'mayor', 'son', 'drug', 'dealing', ""'fathers"", 'sons', 'City', 'Hall', 'trying', 'control', 'who', 'cops', 'can', 'legally', 'bust', 'Jump', 'Street', 'cops', 'are', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'actions', 'hit', 'too', 'close', 'home.Home', 'visible', 'theme', 'season', 'Officer', 'Harry', 'Ioki', 'Ioki', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'immigrant', 'Dustin', 'Nguyen', ""'American"", 'cop', 'wrestle', 'Vietnam', 'dragon', 'angel', 'way', 'get', 'grandmother', 'Vietnam', 'Ioki', 'seriously', 'wounded', 'dramatic', 'two-part', 'season', 'finale', 'Loc', ""'d"", 'out', 'Hanson', 'honestly', 'motivated', 'seek', 'revenge', 'incident']",21 Jump Street - The Complete Third Season
