1062921,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000O785V0,Artist & Author,"[65, 66]","Simply put, this is an amazing story, even more so because it is true!  It is a TV movie, first shown on November 23, 1987, but it doesn't seem like a TV movie at all.  In a way, it is a sort of story of both penance and Lena's growing love for the children.  Lena, although a Jew, posed as a Catholic during the war.  Feeling a bit guilty, after so many other Jews lost their lives in the gas chambers, when Lena discovered there were many orphaned Jewish children, she made it her mission to care for them as a way of making up for her 'sin' of denying her heritage.It seems that Jews were as much hated by the Polish after the war as they were hated by the Gestapo during the war.  So, she faced many difficult and even harrowing situations in her effort to protect, care for and educate those orphaned children.  One interesting aspect was how the children who never denied their heritage felt toward those who became 'Catholic' when they lived as the children of many courageous Catholic families who adopted them for the duration of the war as a means of saving them.  When circumstances in Poland became too dangerous to stay there, she began an odyssey, that would last two years, to smuggle the children across many borders to resettle in Palestine.This isn't a classic movie, and I don't know how many Holocaust movies their needs to be.  But, this is one certainly worth watching for the simple reason that it in many ways shows the persecution from a child's point of view.  It also shows that Polish Jews - even innocent Jewish children - were in great danger after most people thought the Jew's 'War of Survival' was over.Unfortunately, the real Lena Kuchler-Silberman passed away just a few weeks before this movie was first televised.",5,An Unsusal Holocaust Story about Jewish Children,1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,1750,"['Simply', 'put', 'amazing', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'true', 'TV', 'movie', 'first', 'shown', 'November', '23', '1987', ""n't"", 'seem', 'TV', 'movie', 'way', 'sort', 'story', 'penance', 'Lena', 'growing', 'love', 'children', 'Lena', 'Jew', 'posed', 'Catholic', 'war', 'Feeling', 'bit', 'guilty', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Jews', 'lost', 'lives', 'gas', 'chambers', 'when', 'Lena', 'discovered', 'were', 'many', 'orphaned', 'Jewish', 'children', 'made', 'mission', 'care', 'way', 'making', 'up', ""'sin"", 'denying', 'heritage.It', 'Jews', 'were', 'as', 'much', 'hated', 'Polish', 'war', 'were', 'hated', 'Gestapo', 'war', 'So', 'faced', 'many', 'difficult', 'even', 'harrowing', 'situations', 'effort', 'protect', 'care', 'educate', 'orphaned', 'children', 'One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'was', 'how', 'children', 'who', 'never', 'denied', 'heritage', 'felt', 'who', 'became', ""'Catholic"", 'when', 'lived', 'children', 'many', 'courageous', 'Catholic', 'families', 'who', 'adopted', 'duration', 'war', 'means', 'saving', 'When', 'circumstances', 'Poland', 'became', 'too', 'dangerous', 'stay', 'there', 'began', 'odyssey', 'would', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'smuggle', 'children', 'many', 'borders', 'resettle', 'Palestine.This', ""n't"", 'classic', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'Holocaust', 'movies', 'needs', 'be', 'one', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'simple', 'reason', 'many', 'ways', 'persecution', 'child', 'point', 'view', 'also', 'Polish', 'Jews', 'even', 'innocent', 'Jewish', 'children', 'were', 'great', 'danger', 'most', 'people', 'thought', 'Jew', ""'War"", 'Survival', 'was', 'over.Unfortunately', 'real', 'Lena', 'Kuchler-Silberman', 'passed', 'away', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'televised']",Lena My 100 Children
