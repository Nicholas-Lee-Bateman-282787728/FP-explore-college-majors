Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[0, 0]","TITLE: LIVING FREE opened in theaters in the United States on July 12 1972 and it takes 90 minutes to watch. British drama film directed by Jack Couffer and starring Nigel Davenport, Susan Hampshire and Geoffrey Keen. This film is a sequel to the movie Born Free, which was based on the book of the same name by Joy Adamson. Joy Adamson also bases the film Living Free on a book; however, it is not based on the book by the same name but is instead based on the third book in the series, Forever Free.SUMMARY: Born Free was a great family film with both adorable and ferocious animals in the film based on a true story, you would think it wouldn't need a sequel, but one was made. Basically the beginning of the film reminds of the vents from the previous adventure, where naturalist Joy Adamson and husband George cared for three lion cubs, letting go two to go to a zoo, but caring for Elsa until big enough to be let loose in the wild. Time has passed, and adult lioness Elsa has found herself a mate and given birth to a bred of three new lion cubs, Jespah, Gopa and Little Elsa. Sadly, Elsa becomes very sick and dies, leaving behind her helpless cubs, so Joy and George take care of them until they too are grown up, which concerns their friend Kendall. The cubs do indeed grow up, but Kendall says that they are in danger of both the poachers, but also they are in a game preserve owned by the not happy Warden Weaver (Edward Judd). After seeing, them learn to hunt and kill for themselves, and enjoying their occasional company, Joy and George know that they must take action to ensure the lions are captured and taken away to another wild habitat. The mischevisis clubs start to get interested in other animals. They come across a rabbit type creature and they chase him into his hole. While they three clubs look down his hole he comes out the other side and takes off. Then they come upon a baby giraffe, which they chase until one gets kick, and they take off. Then the three try to take on a cow and that doesn&#8217;t go well and they last thing they come across is a snake and they get disinterested in him also.QUESTIONS: What caused Elsa to die? How were three clubs raised? Why the cubs were turn loose? How did the three cubs survive? What did the cubs do that got them in trouble? Why were the cubs moved? Where were the cubs moved?MY THOUGHTS: The first I will say is I don&#8217;t like sequels that change the stars that made the original movie. This movie was a slow starter. It shows many clips from Born Free. However, once you get pass the opening the movie does get a little interesting. When the three clubs adventure out on their own and come across different animals is somewhat amusing. I didn&#8217;t think that Nigel Davenport did as good of job as George Adamson as Bill Travers did. I did think that Susan Hampshire was much better than Virginia McKenna in the role of Joy Adamson was. I did like the sites of Africa in this movie so based on the acting the sites of this movie I give this picture 5 weasel stars.",3,WASN'T BAD,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,3048,"['TITLE', 'LIVING', 'FREE', 'opened', 'theaters', 'United', 'States', 'July', '12', '1972', '90', 'minutes', 'watch', 'British', 'drama', 'film', 'directed', 'Jack', 'Couffer', 'starring', 'Nigel', 'Davenport', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'Geoffrey', 'Keen', 'film', 'sequel', 'movie', 'Born', 'Free', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Joy', 'Adamson', 'Joy', 'Adamson', 'also', 'film', 'Living', 'Free', 'book', 'however', 'not', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'instead', 'based', 'third', 'book', 'series', 'Forever', 'Free.SUMMARY', 'Born', 'Free', 'was', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'adorable', 'ferocious', 'animals', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'would', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'sequel', 'one', 'was', 'made', 'Basically', 'beginning', 'film', 'reminds', 'vents', 'previous', 'adventure', 'where', 'naturalist', 'Joy', 'Adamson', 'husband', 'George', 'cared', 'three', 'lion', 'cubs', 'letting', 'go', 'two', 'go', 'zoo', 'caring', 'Elsa', 'big', 'enough', 'be', 'let', 'loose', 'wild', 'Time', 'passed', 'adult', 'lioness', 'Elsa', 'found', 'mate', 'given', 'birth', 'bred', 'three', 'new', 'lion', 'cubs', 'Jespah', 'Gopa', 'Little', 'Elsa', 'Sadly', 'Elsa', 'very', 'sick', 'dies', 'leaving', 'helpless', 'cubs', 'so', 'Joy', 'George', 'take', 'care', 'too', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'friend', 'Kendall', 'cubs', 'do', 'indeed', 'grow', 'up', 'Kendall', 'are', 'danger', 'poachers', 'also', 'are', 'game', 'preserve', 'owned', 'not', 'happy', 'Warden', 'Weaver', 'Edward', 'Judd', 'seeing', 'learn', 'hunt', 'kill', 'enjoying', 'occasional', 'company', 'Joy', 'George', 'know', 'must', 'take', 'action', 'ensure', 'lions', 'are', 'captured', 'taken', 'away', 'wild', 'habitat', 'mischevisis', 'clubs', 'start', 'get', 'interested', 'other', 'animals', 'come', 'rabbit', 'type', 'creature', 'chase', 'hole', 'three', 'clubs', 'look', 'down', 'hole', 'out', 'other', 'side', 'off', 'Then', 'come', 'baby', 'giraffe', 'chase', 'one', 'kick', 'take', 'off', 'Then', 'three', 'try', 'take', 'cow', 'doesn', '8217', 'go', 'well', 'last', 'thing', 'come', 'across', 'snake', 'get', 'disinterested', 'also.QUESTIONS', 'What', 'caused', 'Elsa', 'die', 'How', 'were', 'three', 'clubs', 'raised', 'Why', 'cubs', 'were', 'turn', 'loose', 'How', 'did', 'three', 'cubs', 'survive', 'What', 'did', 'cubs', 'do', 'got', 'trouble', 'Why', 'were', 'cubs', 'moved', 'Where', 'were', 'cubs', 'moved', 'MY', 'THOUGHTS', 'first', 'will', 'say', 'don', '8217', 'sequels', 'change', 'stars', 'made', 'original', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'slow', 'starter', 'many', 'clips', 'Born', 'Free', 'However', 'once', 'get', 'pass', 'opening', 'movie', 'get', 'little', 'interesting', 'When', 'three', 'clubs', 'adventure', 'out', 'own', 'come', 'different', 'animals', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'didn', '8217', 'think', 'Nigel', 'Davenport', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'George', 'Adamson', 'Bill', 'Travers', 'did', 'did', 'think', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Virginia', 'McKenna', 'role', 'Joy', 'Adamson', 'was', 'did', 'sites', 'Africa', 'movie', 'so', 'based', 'acting', 'sites', 'movie', 'give', 'picture', '5', 'weasel', 'stars']",Living Free VHS

In this case it's not hard to see why: it's pretty awful.Susan Hampshire and Nigel Davenport make poor replacements for Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna. While you wouldn't expect them to match the original couple's easy familiarity, these two don't look like they've even been introduced yet. Worse, the film is a clumsy mess, the first quarter a clumsy rehash of the first film mixing stock footage with awkward reshot word-for-word versions of scenes restaged by the new stars with all the confidence of a blindfolded kid with both legs tied together trying to hit a pi&ntilde;ata (although you do get to see Geoffrey Keene play a scene absolutely identically to his performance with the more experienced stars a few years earlier). When the plot does get going in the last half hour there are some genuinely tense scenes as they attempt to cage Elsa the Lioness's cubs to take them to a new reserve before they are destroyed as a menace to local farms, but you'll probably have given up by then. It doesn't even have the benefit of Scope photography or a John Barry score to sugar the pill, often looking more like a poor TV pilot than a real film (and indeed a TV series did briefly follow, albeit with a new cast).Not good.",2,Forgotten and forgettable sequel,1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,1329,"[""'Living"", 'Free', 'one', 'obscure', 'sequels', 'huge', 'hits', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'exist', 'case', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'pretty', 'awful.Susan', 'Hampshire', 'Nigel', 'Davenport', 'make', 'poor', 'replacements', 'Bill', 'Travers', 'Virginia', 'McKenna', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'match', 'original', 'couple', 'easy', 'familiarity', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', ""'ve"", 'even', 'been', 'introduced', 'yet', 'Worse', 'film', 'clumsy', 'mess', 'first', 'quarter', 'clumsy', 'rehash', 'first', 'film', 'mixing', 'stock', 'footage', 'awkward', 'reshot', 'word-for-word', 'versions', 'scenes', 'restaged', 'new', 'stars', 'confidence', 'blindfolded', 'kid', 'legs', 'tied', 'together', 'trying', 'hit', 'pi', 'ntilde', 'ata', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'Geoffrey', 'Keene', 'play', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'identically', 'performance', 'more', 'experienced', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'When', 'plot', 'get', 'going', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'are', 'genuinely', 'tense', 'scenes', 'attempt', 'cage', 'Elsa', 'Lioness', 'cubs', 'take', 'new', 'reserve', 'are', 'destroyed', 'menace', 'local', 'farms', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'then', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'benefit', 'Scope', 'photography', 'John', 'Barry', 'score', 'sugar', 'pill', 'often', 'looking', 'more', 'poor', 'TV', 'pilot', 'real', 'film', 'indeed', 'TV', 'series', 'did', 'briefly', 'follow', 'new', 'cast', '.Not', 'good']",Living Free VHS
