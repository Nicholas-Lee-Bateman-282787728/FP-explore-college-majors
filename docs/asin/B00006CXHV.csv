That would be an understatement in the highest level of the word.This movie, if you don't already know, is part of the View Askew Universe, created by Kevin Smith.  BUT, this isn't by any means your average Kevin Smith.  There are some snippets of &quot;Smith-quality&quot; dialogue in here and it's fairly well written, but lacks quite a bit of the fun-loving sense of humor that is in Smith's movies.Actually, it would be pretty impossible to have a movie about clown-rape and make it &quot;funny&quot;.  I guess that's where it goes though.  If you're willing to put up with a story driven by the raping of a clown, then you might enjoy this twisted little film.

I'm not really sure how Mr. Smith feels about that, but infamy these days, leads to more fame. Plus Shock-Cinema is most  certainly for the niche-market base. I myself, found it intriguing. Also if you thought this rape scence was hardcore watch the very awesome movie ""Irreversible"" by Gaspar Noe, he has recently had a newer piece come out called ""Enter the Void"", watch that.

712105,A2OTX4X3895YXT,B00006CXHV,BuyCurious,"[0, 0]","Okay, the clown-abuse scene:  Definitely the harshest portrayal of rape I've ever come across (even trumping Blue Velvet).  These villains are far more disturbing than Frank Booth or the rednecks in Deliverance.That aside, not a great movie, but not as horrible as some would have you believe.  The acting is a bit wooden, but the story is fairly interesting and will hold your attention (as opposed to falling asleep on the couch, as I am prone to do!).  One major flaw was the mis-casting of ""silent bob"" as Flappy's agent/publicist.  He doesn't look right in the role, and his acting is pretty bad here.Vulgar has elements that will remind you of Gummo and/or Julien Donkey-Boy.  If you like disturbing films by young up-and-coming, envelope-pushing filmmakers, this will probably be right up your alley.  However, you will probably be hard-pressed to think of anyone you can recommend or lend this to!One thing that can be said, even by those who hate it, is that it is not boring (the worst crime any film can commit).",3,yikes,1038355200,"11 27, 2002",2002,1023,"['Okay', 'clown-abuse', 'scene', 'Definitely', 'harshest', 'portrayal', 'rape', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'come', 'even', 'trumping', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'villains', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'disturbing', 'Frank', 'Booth', 'rednecks', 'Deliverance.That', 'aside', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'horrible', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'acting', 'bit', 'wooden', 'story', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'opposed', 'falling', 'asleep', 'couch', 'am', 'prone', 'do', 'One', 'major', 'flaw', 'was', 'mis-casting', 'silent', 'bob', 'Flappy', 'agent/publicist', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'role', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'here.Vulgar', 'elements', 'will', 'remind', 'Gummo', 'and/or', 'Julien', 'Donkey-Boy', 'like', 'disturbing', 'films', 'young', 'up-and-coming', 'envelope-pushing', 'filmmakers', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'However', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'recommend', 'lend', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'even', 'who', 'hate', 'not', 'boring', 'worst', 'crime', 'film', 'can', 'commit']",N/A

When the clown makes it big on TV, his rapist try to blackmail him.I know this sounds bizarre, but that's exactly what this movie is - bizarre. It's not funny, like other View Askew films (although kevin smith and jason Mewes play minor parts in the fim). It's not a terribly interesting story. Just plain weird.I'm usually not one scared off by the strange or different, but this movie had nothing to offer. No humor, no depth, no interesting dialogue.

712108,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,B00006CXHV,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[1, 1]","by Dane YoussefBryan Johnson shows amazing talent and depth as a first-time greenhorn filmmaker. There's more than just one worthwhile film here. There's two.""Vulgar"" plays out like a scrappy, slapped-together little campy comedy and then shifts wildly into much darker territory. And then back again. And back...Johnson seems to have a natural wild indie touch and while it has touches of some of the darkest nature ever uncovered on the screen, it also has some nice Jersey-blue collar comedy.Now here's a movie Tarantino would enjoy. It's kinda like a soup. It plays out like a stew of movies, styles and ideas. European avant-garde cinema, indie film and campy, low-budget comedy. It's a shame this movie didn't play in Europe and France. Or college kids. This is the kind of thing they all gobble up.I'm glad I bought a copy. It gives me hope as an aspiring filmmaker... and joy and thrills as a movie-lover who loves off-kilter stuff.Brian O' Halloran is touchingly determined and vulnerable as the clown. He scrapes out a meager existence as a ""party whore"" and lives in his hovel of a home, living on s*** wages, barely making ends meet. His landlord is understanding and sympathetic and lets him ""mow the lawn or do some maintenance"" and knocks off a few.Ethan Suplee and Matt Mawer are effective and creepy as his inbred and mentally-retarded sons who seem to have been phoned right out of ""Deliverence.""Jerry Lewkowitz is just plain frightening and disturbing as Ed Fanelli. With his portly beer-belly, bug-eyes, raspy voice and bad wig that looks like a little boy's hair. I heard that the inspiration for this character was Dennis Hopper in ""Blue Velvet."" He's one of the scariest villains (or any kind of characters) to pop up on any kind of cinema in history.The rape sequence with Will is just horrifying. It outdoes the whole scene in ""Blue Velvet"" and literally makes you BELIEVE and FEEL what this poor guy who just wants to entertain little kids is feeling.The morning after where he has his emotional breakdown is just as strong. Will confides in Syd about the whole evening and Syd begs him to go to the cops, but Will swears him to secrecy. These scenes all shows strength, talent and feeling with both O' Halloran's acting and Johnson's directing.Johnson himself, like Tarantino and producer Kevin Smith, once jockeyed in a video store. He gives the movie the flavor of a lot of low-budget films and masters past. He gives some ""Kevin Smith"" flavor in the dialouge and the juice of other great filmmakers', but he also gives it his own signature style. You'd have to see it to know what I mean.Johnson has never been within 200 miles of a film school, so he seems to have gotten all of whatever film education and knowledge from Smith and Mosier.You can tell Johnson is emulating Smith as a filmmaker, like the film's dialouge has an overwritten, over-articulate Kevin Smith-ness to it. Not to mention Smith's one-shot camera set-up. Still, there are moments that generate pain beyond words and conversation that Smith has never shown us.And anyway, this is NOT a Kevin Smith film. I love the man, but this is another cup of tea altogether. Many will see because of the ""Kevin Smith"" name on the marquee. Which means they;ll be in for some serious shock and disappointment.Johnson's only real mistake, in my opinion (and this is one that hurts the movie more than anything else) is his decision to act in it as the clown's only friend. You see why Smith only gave him bit-parts as Steve-Dave. He's no actor. He tends to mumble a lot of the time.Look, read the other ""user reviews"" on IMDb about Johnson's ""Vulgar."" Listen to them describe it. YOU know if it's the movie for you. It all depends on your taste. Go to the site's OFFICIAL WEB PAGE and read the interview with Johnson. After hearing him, does it sound like your type of movie?All in all, this is a hell of a debut. I liked Johnson's different stories and juggling them all at once. Comedy, drama, horror, working-class stories...And at the center of it all, View Askew's poster boy--Flappy the Clown.Have you ever wondered the real story about that clown? Here it is...Now dear readers, I am not recommending this movie as ""fun for the whole family."" I do not recommend this as a movie to see with your drinking acquaintances. No, this a movie for a specific audience with a very acquired palate--darker, daring, low-budget, creepy, campy, gross and funny all at once.Don't see this because Kevin Smith produced it. See it because this is your taste. Read the reviews. Does this sound like your brand of poison?You know who you are.danessf@yahoo.com[...][...]%2Fi8&s;=mt_a",4,Something very different from View-Askew.

I'd warn of SPOILERS but really your senses of sight and hearing are enough to spoil this movie.  I rented it with my now wife then girlfriend as I am a HUGE Kevin Smith fan and I introduced her early on in our relationship to the movies he had out to date I believe it was up through Dogma at that point and we have seen every one of his movies since then in the theater.We rented this because of the view askew label.  She left and went to bed shortly after the brutal rape scene.  I stuck it out just to make sure the ""bad guys"" got their come uppance, but the movie is nearly unwatchable.  Whether it's the completely unfunny writing, the completely nonsense story and plot that has no cohesiveness at all, or the fact that through about half of the movie the voices and actors' mouths are completely out of sync like watching an old Kung Fu movie.  I sat and suffered through bad acting and worse dialogue the only time I actually laughed was when Jay Mewes showed up as the gun salesman and is... well it's Jay except with guns instead of drugs.  At this point you have an idea of how this tragically bad story is going to end but here is where it earns the one star there is a pretty decent twist with the pay off at the end and I won't completely give it away in case you are morbidly curious about this steaming pile of dog doo, but to quote Randall ""evil is punished""  Let me clarify I didn't want to see the bad guys punished out of any sympathy for the clown.

If you accept the challenge, you'll be enduring an unpleasant 86 minutes in a world filled with sad and/or vile people leading miserable lives. The main character (played by Brian O'Halloran, from ""Clerks"") is about the most likeable of the bunch, and he's a pathetic loser. Watching him stumble from one indignity to the next (culminating in a gang rape by a father and his half-wit sons, the movie's most sickening - yet most effective - scenes), he seems a likely candidate for suicide. Instead, though, he finds success when, in a rare moment of courage, he rescues a little girl from her gun-weilding father. But with success comes blackmail and, ultimately, revenge.This cheaply made movie (which ""Dogma"" writer-director Kevin Smith helped produce and has a small role in as well) is not without its merits. The script is better than you might expect and writer-director Bryan Johnson shows a knack for conveying the obscenities of human behavior, showing just enough to make our flesh crawl (though he may have shown more in the unrated version). But the acting is second rate (it should be noted, however, that O'Halloran delivers a fearless performance) and you never buy the main character's success as a syndicated children's TV star. There have been public access shows with higher production values. And even when it seems justice is served, it's hardly triumphant.

712115,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00006CXHV,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[8, 9]","""Vulgar"" came to me word-of-mouth. I'd seen this movie sitting on a video store shelf when it first came out and I had no urge to see it. It wasn't until a couple months ago when a guy I know told me that I ""have to see it."" Reviews on Amazon didn't look good, the cover looks like it was straight-to-video (it, technically, wasn't. It was shown in a few theatres)...But I was intrigued. The film has Kevin Smith has the Executive Producer and stars Brian O'Halloran, better known as Dante in the ""Clerks"" films, as the main character Will Carlson. Will lives in a crappy apartment (and frequently finds people sleeping in the backseat of his car) and works as a birthday party clown called Flappy. One day Will has an epiphany. He'll still do kids birthday parties, but he'll also hit up some bachelor parties as well. The plan goes like this; He'll come to the party dressed like a clown and wearing lingerie. Everyone'll be in on the joke, except the groom. He'll freak the groom out, collect his money, and then the babes will show up. On his first night, Will (who has chosen the moniker Vulgar when doing this particular job) runs into a demented trio of father and sons who brutally rape Will. Will, embarrassed and ashamed, goes home and tries to forget about everything despite complaints from his friend Syd (Bryan Johnson, the writer/director). Then, the unthinkable happens. Will saves a child from a hostage situation and finds himself plastered on TV, being proclaimed a hero. A TV show deal follows and pretty soon, he's being blackmailed by his rapists for $50,000 dollars. If you've seen the cover of the film, you can probably guess what comes next. Jason Mewes (Jay) and Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) both make cameo appearances in the film, although not under their famed monikers. The movie has a straight-to-video feel to it and most viewers won't watch it twice. The acting has it's moments of being pretty good, but is usually laughable due to bad dialogue. O'Halloran does manage to get you to feel sorry for the character, although he looks embarrassed. Ethan Suplee (who appears in Mallrats and is now on the hit show ""My Name is Earl"") plays one/third of the demented trio, as well. The movie is frequently billed as a ""Comedy."" The film has it's subtle moments, but ""comedy"" is stretching it. One bit of subtle humor involves a phone call Flappy makes to a parent to cancel an appearance. He's talking to a woman named Mrs. Affleck who puts her son ""Benny"" on the phone. This is not a great movie, but it is original. Not just the clown thing, but you rarely see male rape (unless the person getting raped is a gay hustler anyway, like in ""Mysterious Skin"") portrayed in film. Johnson could've made this a campy comedy, while making a deeply disturbing portrait of that subject. I think he wanted to, but he just wasn't sure how to film it. Vulgar succeeds in less ways than it doesn't, but if you're into films that fall into the category of this films name or like something a little different you might enjoy this.GRADE: B-",4,Not a Kevin Smith Film and Not as Bad as People Say...,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,3050,"['Vulgar', 'came', 'word-of-mouth', ""'d"", 'seen', 'movie', 'sitting', 'video', 'store', 'shelf', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'had', 'urge', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'couple', 'months', 'ago', 'when', 'guy', 'know', 'told', 'have', 'see', 'Amazon', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'good', 'cover', 'was', 'straight-to-video', 'technically', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'shown', 'few', 'theatres', 'was', 'intrigued', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'stars', 'Brian', ""O'Halloran"", 'better', 'known', 'Dante', 'Clerks', 'films', 'main', 'character', 'Will', 'Carlson', 'Will', 'crappy', 'apartment', 'frequently', 'people', 'sleeping', 'backseat', 'car', 'birthday', 'party', 'clown', 'called', 'Flappy', 'One', 'day', 'Will', 'epiphany', ""'ll"", 'still', 'do', 'kids', 'birthday', 'parties', ""'ll"", 'also', 'hit', 'up', 'bachelor', 'parties', 'well', 'plan', ""'ll"", 'come', 'party', 'dressed', 'clown', 'wearing', 'lingerie', 'Everyone', ""'ll"", 'be', 'joke', 'groom', ""'ll"", 'freak', 'groom', 'collect', 'money', 'then', 'babes', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'first', 'night', 'Will', 'who', 'chosen', 'moniker', 'Vulgar', 'when', 'doing', 'particular', 'job', 'demented', 'trio', 'father', 'sons', 'who', 'brutally', 'rape', 'Will', 'Will', 'embarrassed', 'ashamed', 'home', 'tries', 'forget', 'everything', 'complaints', 'friend', 'Syd', 'Bryan', 'Johnson', 'writer/director', 'Then', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'Will', 'child', 'hostage', 'situation', 'plastered', 'TV', 'being', 'proclaimed', 'hero', 'TV', 'show', 'deal', 'pretty', 'soon', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'rapists', '50,000', 'dollars', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'cover', 'film', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'what', 'next', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Jay', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'film', 'not', 'famed', 'monikers', 'movie', 'straight-to-video', 'feel', 'most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'twice', 'acting', 'moments', 'being', 'pretty', 'good', 'usually', 'laughable', 'due', 'bad', 'dialogue', ""O'Halloran"", 'manage', 'get', 'feel', 'sorry', 'character', 'embarrassed', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'who', 'Mallrats', 'now', 'hit', 'show', 'Name', 'Earl', 'one/third', 'demented', 'trio', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'frequently', 'billed', 'Comedy', 'film', 'subtle', 'moments', 'comedy', 'stretching', 'One', 'bit', 'subtle', 'humor', 'phone', 'call', 'Flappy', 'parent', 'cancel', 'appearance', 'talking', 'woman', 'named', 'Mrs.', 'Affleck', 'who', 'son', 'Benny', 'phone', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'original', 'Not', 'just', 'clown', 'thing', 'rarely', 'see', 'male', 'rape', 'person', 'getting', 'raped', 'gay', 'hustler', 'anyway', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Johnson', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'campy', 'comedy', 'making', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'portrait', 'subject', 'think', 'wanted', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'film', 'Vulgar', 'less', 'ways', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'films', 'fall', 'category', 'films', 'name', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'might', 'enjoy', 'this.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

712118,A3DT5X9I5IAEBL,B00006CXHV,man_invisible,"[4, 7]","""Vulgar"" is a would-be cult classic that has no idea what it is (or wants to be).  The mood shifts from comedy to drama on a scene-by-scene basis, with no consistent medium being reached; the result is an extremely unbalanced film.  The film starts with a down-on-his luck clown named Flappy, who's a pathetic pin cushion to everyone he meets.  The early scenes have some humor that's loud and obnoxious, but effective in a low-intellect way, but then the movie delves into a dark viciousness that comes out of nowhere.  Anyway, Flappy decides to become a transvestite clown to entertain at bachelor parties and his first clients turn out to be a sicko father-and-son trio who proceed to beat and rape Flappy (in an echo of ""I Spit on Your Grave"").  Why do they do this?  Well, because they're creatures of the plot--they exist to be as pointlessly mean and insipid as the script requires, without any real motive or personality.  Shortly after this incident, Flappy achieves fame after foiling a hostage situation (a lot like ""Death to Smoochy""), but the rapists come up with a ridiculous extortion threat...  And, well, ""Vulgar"" remains inconsistent to the very end--the viciousness and humor aren't mixed into an effective cocktail of 'black comedy'...writer-director Bryan Johnson just cuts from one mood to the next without any balance.  Some of the acting is notable in an amateurish way (I really thought Flappy's friend was a hoot), and the New Jersey locations seem authentic, but the movie is a cavalcade of shock-value without any real purpose (a lot like ""The Doom Generation"").  My advice: if you want a straight-faced revenge flick, rent ""The Last House on the Left"" (Wes Craven's debut); if you want dark comedy that's at least somewhat competent, check out ""Death to Smoochy.""

Will Carlson (Brian O'Halloran) already has a worthless life BEFORE he gets raped by a sick, sadistic psycho and his two idiot sons (these scenes are graphic and intense, but perhaps not as graphic as the hype has led you to belive). Soon after, he saves the life of a little girl and makes it big, even landing a gig as the host of his own TV show. Of course, the rapists call him up and blackmail him, having videotaped their brutal violation. Tough, tough, depressing - but humorously so. It's so dark, you might find yourself laughing.Also included on the VULGAR DVD is a commentary on DOGMA. But rather than it being a look at Dogma - which would be hard to explain, this being a different movie - it is more a look at the complaints that DOGMA brought on from the Catholic activists. While it is sort of interesting, why does Kevin Smith really feel the need to respond so strongly to his detractors? Don't give them the time of day, and certainly not a special commentary devoted entirely to the people who protest purely for the press.

712121,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00006CXHV,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[10, 16]","In his directorial debut, Bryan Johnson's very violent cult-wannabe film ""Vulgar"" portrays the life of the hapless Will Carlson (Brian O'Halloran) struggling to earn a living by working as a clown named ""Flappy"" for children's parties.  Living in a dump and driving a worthless car, Will wants to earn more money, but only as a clown.  He foolishly decides to work as a scantily-clad, clown-in-drag named ""Vulgar"" at men's bachelor parties. His first job as ""Vulgar"" takes him to a motel where three men are waiting: a father named Ed Fanelli (Jerry Lewkowitz) and his two sons Frankie (Ethan Suplee) and Gino (Matthew Maher).  Ed, Frankie and Gino aren't there for a bachelor party; instead, they rape the unsuspecting clown.  After being bound, beaten and raped, the three leave ""Vulgar"" for dead in the motel.  Realizing he's alone, Will struggles back to his car and drives home where he makes a half-hearted attempt at suicide.Telling his friend Syd (Bryan Johnson) about the ordeal, Will finds the strength to return to the safer job of being a clown at children's parties.  Upon reaching a home where he is to perform as ""Flappy"", he finds it surrounded by police.  The child's estranged father (Scott Schiaffo) is holding his daughter at gunpoint inside the house.  Somehow, with the home surrounded by armed police, Will dressed in his brightly-colored clown costume sneaks into the house and rescues the girl, becoming an instant hero.  (This is the part of the film where my opinion took its final turn for the worst.)  Will is approached by TV-producer Martan Ingram (Kevin Smith, ""Silent Bob"" of ""Dogma"" & ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" fame) to star in his own children's television show as ""Flappy"".  Will agrees and becomes an instant success, but ghosts from the past threaten his achievement.Kevin Smith's performance as the TV producer was both wooden and unbelievable.  Jerry Lewkowitz' performance as Ed Fanelli was completely one-dimensional as were the brief performances for his wife and daughter (Melissa Rayworth and Deanna Rowe) and his two sons.  Jason Mewes (""Jay"" of ""Dogma"" & ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" fame) makes a cameo appearance as the character Tuott the Basehead,  but he should simply have been named ""Jay"" because he played exactly the same character as he did in ""Dogma"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"".  (Jason Mewes is either a victim of typecasting or extremely one-dimensional.)  Brian O'Halloran's performance as Will Carlson/Flappy/Vulgar was okay, as was Bryan Johnson's performance as Syd.  By her appearance and demeanor, Will's mother in the film (Debra Karr) reminded me of the Dark Mother (Eisei Amamoto) from the awful 1978 Japanese ""Star Wars"" rip-off film ""Message From Space"".The plot, though depressing and gruesome, was, nonetheless, believable until Will as ""Flappy"" sneaks into the house surrounded by police unnoticed.  From that point forward, the plot becomes completely predictable. Several reviewers have commented on the humor used in the film.  The humor from incendental characters of trash-throwing teenagers and drunken bums was nothing more than juvenile.  With the graphic violence contained in the film and an R-rating, it is unlikely that any responsible parent would allow their teenaged children (or younger) to watch the film.  Therefore, the juvenile humor is highly unlikely to be enjoyed by adults.  (Of the four of us that watched the film together after renting it, hardly any of us laughed at all.)I do give Bryan Johnson credit for filming what is probably one of most viscous rape scenes ever filmed, but he still has quite a bit to learn about directing.  The plot is not engaging and none of us watching the film were able to relate with any of the characters. If the intent was to combine horrific violence with humor, the film completely fails because the juvenile incedental humor was an extremely minor element as compared to the main characters' attempt to present very violent drama.As for DVD quality, the film itself was clearly shot on a shoe-string budget and watching it was very difficult because the sound was not synchronized with the picture.  Some scenes were worse than others in which the sound followed the picture by as much as 2 seconds, giving the illusion that the film had been dubbed.  The DVD that was rented may have been defective, the transfer of the film to DVD may have been poor or the film itself may be defective.  (Since I never saw the film in a theater, I don't know if the sound was originally properly synchronized to the picture.)  The combination of extremely poor DVD quality, unbelievable plot, and one-dimensional acting earns this film 1 star in my book.  With no real redeeming value, I cannot recommend this film to anyone.",1,Poor DVD Quality Is the Least of This Film's Problems,1040601600,"12 23, 2002",2002,4771,"['directorial', 'debut', 'Bryan',

712123,ADQQE8RSV6KFP,B00006CXHV,"Mondo Vendo ""Mondo Vendo""","[6, 7]","This movie is an incredible gem.  It definitely is not the Kevin Smith type lowbrow trash that you think when you see his name on it.  This movie is written and directed by Bryan Johnson who is great at putting many levels of detail into every scene.It is primarily an incredible comedy.  The comedy is focused mainly on conversational sarcasm between characters and Flappy's undeserved always-a-loser lot in life.In the middle the comedy gets real dark as Flappy the clown/now Vulgar gets raped by a psychotic father and his two equally psychotic sons.The character of the father is brilliantly darkly humorous as he just brutally spouts his unrelentingly vicious rape rantings.  This guys voice and actions are just so exceptionally well suited and acted.Brian O Halloran(?) who plays Flappy/Vulgar also delivers outstanding emotional performances throughout the entire movie.  This performance easily beats anything Hollywood would give an award for.  After the rape, the comedy entirely disappears for a while as Flappy emotionally deals with the rape.  This is so well acted, it goes beyond even what films like Schindler's List does in presenting emotions of this type.  This combination of comedy and such intense emotional drama is too much for most mainstream viewers and why this movie is so hated.A favorite aspect I had was when we catch up with the father who raped Flappy back at home and his wife and daughter so viciously berate him.That people say this is a revenge film shows that people are so put off that they don't even pay attention to the end.I won't give away the details of how I mean this but Flappy does not get revenge in this movie.  My first reaction was that this was disappointing and an anti-climatic ending to the movie.  But after other viewings Flappy being cheated of his revenge is a very interesting aspect of the entire story.I think Vulgar is probably the end of Bryan Johnson ever doing anything as the main drive of a movie project.  This movie is so hated and unappreciated.  I can only be thankful this movie exists and can't be taken back.Bryan Johnson is simply above the standards of mainstream audiences which are not interested in anything deeper than obvious punchlines and standard structured presentation of material.As the other reviews show, either people hated this and called it trash.  Or people understood how well crafted the film is but still were put off by the intensity of the dramatic aspects.  (At least honest and with the integrity to realize and admit it)Bryan Johnson definitely is talented far beyond his View Askew/Kevin Smith associations.  I wish I could look forward to more brilliant work from him though I doubt many opportunities will be available due to this film's reaction.  Cream may rise to the top of milk, yet as the world is a toilet, sh*t is what obviously rises to the top of the bowl.If you can accept a film that can brilliantly combine two quite opposite aspects (comedy and intense rape drama), this is for you.  If you simplistically view this as making rape into comedy, then stay away.One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time!!!",5,Brilliant,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,3138,"['movie', 'incredible', 'gem', 'definitely', 'not', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'type', 'lowbrow', 'trash', 'think', 'when', 'see', 'name', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'Bryan', 'Johnson', 'who', 'great', 'putting', 'many', 'levels', 'detail', 'scene.It', 'primarily', 'incredible', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'focused', 'mainly', 'conversational', 'sarcasm', 'characters', 'Flappy', 'undeserved', 'always-a-loser', 'lot', 'middle', 'comedy', 'real', 'dark', 'Flappy', 'clown/now', 'Vulgar', 'raped', 'psychotic', 'father', 'two', 'equally', 'psychotic', 'sons.The', 'character', 'father', 'brilliantly', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'just', 'brutally', 'unrelentingly', 'vicious', 'rape', 'rantings', 'guys', 'voice', 'actions', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'suited', 'acted.Brian', 'O', 'Halloran', 'who', 'Flappy/Vulgar', 'also', 'outstanding', 'emotional', 'performances', 'entire', 'movie', 'performance', 'easily', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'give', 'award', 'rape', 'comedy', 'entirely', 'while', 'Flappy', 'emotionally', 'rape', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'even', 'what', 'films', 'Schindler', 'List', 'presenting', 'emotions', 'type', 'combination', 'comedy', 'such', 'intense', 'emotional', 'drama', 'too', 'much', 'most', 'mainstream', 'viewers', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'hated.A', 'favorite', 'aspect', 'had', 'was', 'when', 'catch', 'up', 'father', 'who', 'raped', 'Flappy', 'back', 'home', 'wife', 'daughter', 'so', 'viciously', 'berate', 'him.That', 'people', 'say', 'revenge', 'film', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'put', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'pay', 'attention', 'end.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'how', 'mean', 'Flappy', 'not', 'get', 'revenge', 'movie', 'first', 'reaction', 'was', 'was', 'disappointing', 'anti-climatic', 'ending', 'movie', 'other', 'viewings', 'Flappy', 'being', 'cheated', 'revenge', 'very', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'entire', 'story.I', 'think', 'Vulgar', 'probably', 'end', 'Bryan', 'Johnson', 'ever', 'doing', 'anything', 'main', 'drive', 'movie', 'project', 'movie', 'so', 'hated', 'unappreciated', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'thankful', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'back.Bryan', 'Johnson', 'simply', 'standards', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'anything', 'deeper', 'obvious', 'punchlines', 'standard', 'structured', 'presentation', 'material.As', 'other', 'reviews', 'show', 'either', 'people', 'hated', 'called', 'trash', 'people', 'understood', 'how', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'still', 'were', 'put', 'off', 'intensity', 'dramatic', 'aspects', 'least', 'honest', 'integrity', 'realize', 'admit', 'Bryan', 'Johnson', 'definitely', 'talented', 'far', 'View', 'Askew/Kevin', 'Smith', 'associations', 'wish', 'could', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'brilliant', 'work', 'doubt', 'many', 'opportunities', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'due', 'film', 'reaction', 'Cream', 'may', 'rise', 'top', 'milk', 'yet', 'world', 'toilet', 'sh*t', 'what', 'obviously', 'top', 'bowl.If', 'can', 'accept', 'film', 'can', 'brilliantly', 'combine', 'two', 'quite', 'opposite', 'aspects', 'comedy', 'intense', 'rape', 'drama', 'simplistically', 'view', 'making', 'rape', 'comedy', 'then', 'stay', 'away.One', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time']",N/A

This film is categorized as a dark comedy, but is anything but...it's not funny, it's not serious, it's just disgusting.Many people will be talking about this sick film, but beware it's not for everyone...actually it's not for anyone.Nick Gonnella",1,"A sick, disgusting, disturbing film!",1031011200,"09 3, 2002",2002,1257,"['clown', 'down', 'luck', 'party', 'performer', 'Living', 'run-down', 'house', 'driving', 'beat-up', 'car', 'never', 'having', 'money', 'pockets', 'Flappy', 're-invent', 'Vulgar', 'cross-dressing', 'party', 'clown', 'adults', 'What', 'Vulgar', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'party', 'will', 'be', 'bunch', 'demented', 'rednecks', 'who', 'gang', 'rape', 'beat', 'him.Humiliated', 'suicide', 'Flappy', 'life', 'be', 'strange', 'twist', 'fate', 'hero.Thrown', 'spotlight', 'saving', 'child', 'hostage', 'situation', 'Flappy', 'fame', 'fortune', 'finally', 'peace', 'life', 'attackers', 'surface', 'threaten', 'expose', 'video', 'tape', 'rape.', 'Vulgar', 'truly', 'one', 'sickest', 'twisted', 'most', 'disturbing', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'How', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Clerks', 'Dogma', 'fame', 'could', 'back', 'film', 'being', 'producer', 'Shot', 'low-budget', 'yellowish', 'grainy', 'film', 'Vulgar', 'ugly', 'movie', 'about', 'even', 'uglier', 'people', 'mind', 'hot', 'poker', 'film', 'categorized', 'dark', 'comedy', 'anything', 'not', 'funny', 'not', 'serious', 'just', 'disgusting.Many', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'sick', 'film', 'beware', 'not', 'everyone', 'actually', 'not', 'anyone.Nick', 'Gonnella']",N/A

""Vulgar"" is the definition in films of acquired taste, you're either into it or you're not. Granted ""Vulgar"" in general is not great cinema, it's not even great independent filmmaking, but from the first scene it is clear what the movie's intentions are and in that sense it succeeds. What director Bryan Johnson gives us is a dark comedy mixed with the trappings of the typical psycho movie. From the start Johnson chooses a subject that is already creepy to some people, clowns, and then throws in homosexual rape, paranoia and a gunfight finale to make this into PURE B-movie material. Had Kevin Smith not produced this movie it could indeed have been worse than what people already think it to be. As a dark comedy it works, we laugh and feel guilty sometimes about it (at least some of us), the story has a creepy of way of getting under your skin with the gritty, low-grade photography and isolated settings, there's even a strangeness to the dialogue and though some complain about the sound mix, it adds to the movie's weird allure. Like the much superior ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Vulgar"" looks cheap but that is precisely how it manipulates the mood of the viewer. Even the music sounds like that dark monotone score you hear in the occasional PSA on television. Yes, it is true that the actors aren't exactly A-list stuff, but this is a small budget production and you can't expect anymore from it than what it is capable of delivering. ""Vulgar"" is creepy, strange and certainly memorable, it is not great but for those looking for something RADICALLY different, here's a movie that fits that category.",3,"A Dark, Savage Comedy.",1106524800,"01 24, 2005",2005,1719,"['have', 'obviously', 'termed', 'movie', 'depraved', 'uncomfortable', 'are', 'absolutely', 'right', 'Vulgar', 'definition', 'films', 'acquired', 'taste', ""'re"", ""'re"", 'not', 'Granted', 'Vulgar', 'general', 'not', 'great', 'cinema', 'not', 'even', 'great', 'independent', 'filmmaking', 'first', 'scene', 'clear', 'what', 'movie', 'intentions', 'are', 'sense', 'What', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Johnson', 'dark', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'trappings', 'typical', 'psycho', 'movie', 'start', 'Johnson', 'subject', 'already', 'creepy', 'people', 'clowns', 'then', 'homosexual', 'rape', 'paranoia', 'gunfight', 'finale', 'make', 'PURE', 'B-movie', 'material', 'Had', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'not', 'produced', 'movie', 'could', 'indeed', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'what', 'people', 'already', 'think', 'be', 'dark', 'comedy', 'laugh', 'feel', 'guilty', 'sometimes', 'least', 'story', 'creepy', 'way', 'getting', 'skin', 'gritty', 'low-grade', 'photography', 'isolated', 'settings', 'even', 'strangeness', 'dialogue', 'complain', 'sound', 'mix', 'movie', 'weird', 'allure', 'much', 'superior', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Vulgar', 'cheap', 'precisely', 'how', 'mood', 'viewer', 'Even', 'music', 'dark', 'monotone', 'score', 'hear', 'occasional', 'PSA', 'television', 'Yes', 'true', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'A-list', 'stuff', 'small', 'budget', 'production', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anymore', 'what', 'capable', 'delivering', 'Vulgar', 'creepy', 'strange', 'certainly', 'memorable', 'not', 'great', 'looking', 'something', 'RADICALLY', 'different', 'here', 'movie', 'category']",N/A

I first rented the movie because of the cast list on the back cover: Brian O'Halloran of `Clerks' starred (where he's known for his role as Dante), along with Smith himself, Jason Mewes, and a few other Smith-movie regulars (the infamous Walt ""the fanboy"" has a very significant role).  But overall I was more than disappointed. And to be honest, a bit sickened.  I love Kevin's movies; all of them, just not this one (even the underground `A Better Place' was more pleasurable than this) . I'd recommend 'Vulgar' only to anyone who is a HUMONGOUS fan of Kevin Smith and the supporting actors who appear in small roles in his other films. God, I can't even begin to imagine what the DVD unrated version would be like.  And I don't want to.  This is not a comedy.  This is not like `Clerks', `Mallrats', `Chasing Amy', `Dogma', or `Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back'.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for the decent cast and the ""faster than Walt Flanagan's dog"" reference.  Before you think about watching this movie, ask yourself if you'd enjoy watching a poor, pitiful clown get brutally raped by two kids and their father.

The acting is ridiculous... although Brian O'Halleran does a respectable enough job. Bryan Johnson himself added a little zing, I guess. But Kevin Smith's role is both cheap and embarrassing and makes a mockery of every scene he bellyflops into. The rest of the cast (including Jason Mewes and the over-the-top mother) are rock-bottom as well. As for the script... let's just say it REALLY goes downhill after Flappy ""saves the day"".
