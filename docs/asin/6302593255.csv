321765,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6302593255,Alex Udvary,"[3, 7]","""George Washington Slept Here"" stars Ann Sheridan and Jack Benny as a married couple that buys a run down house where supposedly George Washington slept. The movie has a clear resemblance to films like ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House"" and ""The Jackpot"", in which unsuspecting nice people find themselves in complicated situations where one mishaps leads to another.I've always been a big Jack Benny fan. I think he had the greast comedic persona of all time. His persona has been so strong to this very day some people have difficulty thiking of him any other way. We completely bought the character he played. Benny though had trouble finding films that made use to his talents. Like Bob Hope or W.C. Fields their movies were really just excuses for their fans to pay money to see them iin movies. Plot really don't matter, we just came for the jokes. I have seen Benny in ""To be or not To Be"" and ""The Horn Blows at Midnight"". I enjoyed his performance in both, but, believe it or not I found Benny all wrong for this movie. Now perhaps this isn't Benny's fault. The movie was based on a play written by Kaufman and Hart. Maybe they never intended for Jack Benny to ever play this role. But I found Benny annoying in this movie. All he does is complain. And Ann Sheridan is annoying for a completely different reason, her stupidity. She's so optimistic.""George Washington..ect"" also lacks the charm of a film like ""Mr. Blandings"". In that movie Cary Grant and Mryna Loy played their parts straight. Here Benny and Sheridan know they are in a comedy. Especially Benny.Given Jack Benny's persona its a shame the movie doesn't take advantage of it. Benny just dishes out cash, never complaining. This is the same man who said ""I'm thinking it over"" when held at gun point and told ""Your money or your life!"". What if, in order to save money Benny decided to help fix the place. This would have caused more funny scenes, and would have shown Benny gaining an emotional investment in the house.The film was directed by William Keighley who also directed Kaufman and Hart's film adaptation of ""The Man Who Came To Dinner"", there is a direct reference to that play in this film. He also directed several Errol Flynn movies; ""The Master of Ballantrae"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", and ""The Prince and the Pauper"". But I'm not convince he understood comedy. And that's what hurts this movie most.Bottom-line: Good promise that doesn't quite deliver. Benny isn't used to his fullest capabilities and that hurts the movie. Not enough big laughs, but, if you're a Jack Benny fan check it out.",3,Mr. Benny Builds His Dream House,1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,2592,"['George', 'Washington', 'Slept', 'Here', 'stars', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'married', 'couple', 'run', 'down', 'house', 'where', 'supposedly', 'George', 'Washington', 'slept', 'movie', 'clear', 'resemblance', 'films', 'Mr.', 'Blandings', 'Builds', 'Dream', 'House', 'Jackpot', 'unsuspecting', 'nice', 'people', 'find', 'complicated', 'situations', 'where', 'one', 'another.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'big', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'fan', 'think', 'had', 'greast', 'comedic', 'persona', 'time', 'persona', 'been', 'so', 'strong', 'very', 'day', 'people', 'have', 'difficulty', 'thiking', 'other', 'way', 'completely', 'bought', 'character', 'played', 'Benny', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'films', 'made', 'use', 'talents', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'W.C.', 'Fields', 'movies', 'were', 'really', 'just', 'excuses', 'fans', 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'iin', 'movies', 'Plot', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'just', 'came', 'jokes', 'have', 'seen', 'Benny', 'be', 'not', 'Be', 'Horn', 'Blows', 'Midnight', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'believe', 'not', 'found', 'Benny', 'wrong', 'movie', 'Now', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'Benny', 'fault', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'play', 'written', 'Kaufman', 'Hart', 'Maybe', 'never', 'intended', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'ever', 'play', 'role', 'found', 'Benny', 'annoying', 'movie', 'complain', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'annoying', 'completely', 'different', 'reason', 'stupidity', 'so', 'optimistic', 'George', 'Washington..ect', 'also', 'charm', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Blandings', 'movie', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Mryna', 'Loy', 'played', 'parts', 'straight', 'Here', 'Benny', 'Sheridan', 'know', 'are', 'comedy', 'Especially', 'Benny.Given', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'persona', 'shame', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'advantage', 'Benny', 'just', 'out', 'cash', 'never', 'complaining', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'said', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'over', 'when', 'held', 'gun', 'point', 'told', 'money', 'life', 'What', 'order', 'save', 'money', 'Benny', 'decided', 'help', 'fix', 'place', 'would', 'have', 'caused', 'more', 'funny', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'Benny', 'gaining', 'emotional', 'investment', 'house.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'William', 'Keighley', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Kaufman', 'Hart', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Man', 'Who', 'Dinner', 'direct', 'reference', 'play', 'film', 'also', 'directed', 'several', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'movies', 'Master', 'Ballantrae', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Prince', 'Pauper', ""'m"", 'not', 'convince', 'understood', 'comedy', 'what', 'movie', 'most.Bottom-line', 'Good', 'promise', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deliver', 'Benny', ""n't"", 'used', 'fullest', 'capabilities', 'movie', 'Not', 'enough', 'big', 'laughs', ""'re"", 'Jack', 'Benny', 'fan', 'check', 'out']",N/A

321767,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6302593255,calvinnme,"[3, 3]","This is a better comedy than the other reviews indicate. To appreciate it you have to remember two things - it was made in 1942, and thus there are quite a few patriotic themes in the movie, since that was the kind of film being made at the beginning of World War II, when the U.S. didn't yet know if it would be successful fighting a two front war in which everything was at stake. The second thing to remember is that Jack Benny did all of his scenes with Percy Kilbride (later known as Pa Kettle) on days in which he had gotten no sleep the night before. He did this deliberately, because Jack had insisted Kilbride play the part when Jack Warner just wanted to insert one of his contract players. Jack Benny insisted that Kilbride made the play and was thus essential for the movie. Jack Benny got his way, but every time Jack Benny looked at Percy Kilbride when he was shooting the movie he broke into hysterical laughter. When the director threatened to remove Benny if he continued this, then Benny decided to stay up all night before he had any scenes with Kilbride because then he was so exhausted that he just didn't care.If you're in the mood for a light sweet movie from the 40's with Benny's brand of understated comedy, this certainly fits the bill. Just don't expect Benny the miser of Jack's radio and TV days. This film takes advantage of Benny's comic timing and deadpan delivery of comic observations when confronted by outrageous behavior and situations on all sides, but it is just not a role for a cheapskate.",5,"Benny is a bit stiff here, but there's a good reason",1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,1531,"['better', 'comedy', 'other', 'reviews', 'indicate', 'appreciate', 'have', 'remember', 'two', 'things', 'was', 'made', '1942', 'thus', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'patriotic', 'themes', 'movie', 'was', 'kind', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'beginning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'when', 'U.S.', 'did', ""n't"", 'yet', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'successful', 'fighting', 'two', 'front', 'war', 'everything', 'was', 'stake', 'second', 'thing', 'remember', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'did', 'scenes', 'Percy', 'Kilbride', 'later', 'known', 'Pa', 'Kettle', 'days', 'had', 'gotten', 'no', 'sleep', 'night', 'before', 'did', 'deliberately', 'Jack', 'had', 'insisted', 'Kilbride', 'play', 'part', 'when', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'just', 'wanted', 'insert', 'one', 'contract', 'players', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'insisted', 'Kilbride', 'made', 'play', 'was', 'thus', 'essential', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'got', 'way', 'time', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'looked', 'Percy', 'Kilbride', 'when', 'was', 'shooting', 'movie', 'broke', 'hysterical', 'laughter', 'When', 'director', 'threatened', 'remove', 'Benny', 'continued', 'then', 'Benny', 'decided', 'stay', 'up', 'night', 'had', 'scenes', 'Kilbride', 'then', 'was', 'so', 'exhausted', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'light', 'sweet', 'movie', '40', 'Benny', 'brand', 'understated', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'bill', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Benny', 'miser', 'Jack', 'radio', 'TV', 'days', 'film', 'advantage', 'Benny', 'comic', 'timing', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'comic', 'observations', 'when', 'confronted', 'outrageous', 'behavior', 'situations', 'sides', 'just', 'not', 'role', 'cheapskate']",N/A

More importantly it was produced in 1941 as the war in Europe raged & America faced the choice of joining the Allies or not. Times were tough & the average man knew they weren't getting any easier.This outrageous comedy of pratfalls & struggle to overcome apparently limitless hurdles was ripe for the times as each housewife hoped for their own home in the country & each man saw his patience stretched to the breaking point. The ending obviously referring to a nation facing a decision as to whether to go to war or not, was not a call to influence war or peace as a decision but rather was a call for Americans including neighbors to stick together regardless of the choice made.There had not been a time more appropriate for that call since 1929 & these people were familiar with 1929 having lived through those years by banding together as families & as communities. This movie fit its time as well as any before it had & who could guess that a dilapidated old house would spawn 3 fun shows such as I mentioned here earlier. 4 out of 5 Amazon stars for this one.Off the top of my head I can currently only think of 1 other set of three movies spawned by one great one. That is The Cat & the Canary, The Old Dark House & The Haunting. Come to think of it that one spawned 4 including Haunted Manor.

If it's Charlie Chaplin slipping on a banana peel or Lucille Ball taking the pie to the face it's hilarious.  The premise of ""George Washington Slept Here"" of an urban couple, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan, purchasing a dilapidated rural colonial farmhouse isn't the most original but put Benny in full apoplexy mode you get movie magic. Benny is simply brilliant here whether he is in a barely contained panic attack or spouting out sarcastic wisecracks.  Good supporting turns by Percy ""Pa Kettle"" Kilbride as a slow talking caretaker who is in a perpetual search for well water and Charles Coburn as the sponging rich uncle.

Kauffman &amp; Moss Hart's GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE was one of Broadway's most successfull comedies of the early 1940s, a bright and witty tale with a slightly Americana tone that World War II audiences found particularly appealing.  The film version, sparked up by the completely unexpected chemistry of dry-humored Jack Benny and &quot;Oomph Girl&quot; Ann Sheridan, is every bit as charming.When New Yorkers Bill and Connie Fuller (Benny and Sheridan) are evicted from their apartment (their third change of address in less than a year), wife Connie decides what they need is a place in the country... and buys an incredibly dilapidated house where George Washington is said to have once slept.  Needless to say, husband Bill is horrified--and keeps on being horrified as the price of renovation skyrockets.  Benny was most popular when he played himself in roles tailored to his talents, but although this role is atypical his talents are well suited to the constantly harried Bill Fuller--and he has remarkable rapport with co-star Ann Sheridan, an underestimated actress who shows tremendous flair for comedy as his determinedly optimistic wife.  Both are well supported by a cast that includes Charles Coburn, Joyce Reynolds, and Percy Kilbride, and Hattie McDaniel (best remembered as Mammy in GONE WITH THE WIND) really shines as Hester, their long-suffering domestic who finds herself with a hole in the kitchen wall big enough for a horse to walk through--and one does!

Without Bill's knowledge or consent, Connie buys a ramshackled 200 year old mansion in rural Conneticut. Legend has it General Washington stayed there during our revolution. Bill is strictly a urban dweller from NYC but they've been kicked out of there second apartment in a year. You cannot think of something that doesn't go wrong when they move to the country. Bill, in despair, watches as the place bleeds them dry & strains their marriage. He blames Connie, rightfully so, for being suckered. Benny is hilarious of course. He has to act but just a little bit. He is still playing the ever exasperated Jack Benny, then at his height of popularity. The house doesn't even have a right of way or a road. The commuter train back to the city has the most inconvienent schedule ever. As a final indignity, research finds that George Washington never slept there. But Benedict Arnold did. Hilarious.  Charles Coburn plays a penniless, demanding uncle & the rest of the supporting cast is pretty good. The dry well, rotting floors, leaking roof all evaporate in a pariotic flourish that saves all.

A black and white film with the great Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan was certainly underrated when it was made and it still is today. It's a gem that I think most people pass by, but if you see it I promise you a laugh a minute. There was only one Jack Benny and it's hard to imagine Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan in the same movie, but they play off each other very well. It's a story about a couple who live in the city and unbeknownst to Jack, his wife, Ann Sheridan buys a home, that's a bit more than a fixed me up.

321781,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,6302593255,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[0, 0]","This is a classic comedy at its best starring Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan. It is based on the 1940 play by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman adapted by Everett Freeman. This is a story about a couple, Bill and Connie Fuller from New York City, moving into the country in Pennsylvania to fix up a dilapidated house and experience the pleasure (and lots of pain) in the process. The movie is written splendidly to suit the comedic skills of the great Jack Benny and superbly assisted by the beautiful Ann Sheridan. When Connie Fuller bought this house, she forgets little details like; the house has rotten floors, no bathroom, no water and no roof. The consolation is that George Washington once slept in that house. But later it turns out that Benedict Arnold lived there. Compounded to these problems, they have an uncooperative neighbor, Mr. Prescott (Charles Dingle) who is too eager to make the life of Bill Fuller very uncomfortable. In the midst of all this, Connie is accused by Bill of having an affair with local antique dealer Jeff Douglas (Harvey Stephens). This is an absolute screwball slapstick that everyone in the family enjoys it. You will laugh all the way to the end.At the end even the rich uncle of Connie, Stanley's (Charles Coburn) little scheme to help the Fullers fails miserably. When everything looks bad, mysteriously the Fuller's dog finds an old letter in a boot that Kimber discovered while digging for a well. It is a letter from George Washington which is valuable enough to pay the mortgage on time and avert the foreclosure. The house is secure, beautiful and fully paid for just in time for the arrival of seventeen-year locusts.Some of my favorite conversation in the movie is between Bill and Connie; In one scene, Bill Fuller asks; ""Connie, why didn't you tell me about this letter from the bank?"" Connie Fuller: ""I didn't want to bother you, Bill."" Then Bill Fuller: ""Bother me? It's just a letter about foreclosure, that's all."" In another scene; Connie Fuller: ""Darling, what's the matter with your head."" Bill Fuller: There's nothing the matter with my head, Connie. I'm holding it because it's the only head left in the family.""1.George Washington Slept Here.",5,The Fuller's move into the country,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,2201,"['classic', 'comedy', 'best', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'based', '1940', 'play', 'Moss', 'Hart', 'George', 'S.', 'Kaufman', 'adapted', 'Everett', 'Freeman', 'story', 'couple', 'Bill', 'Connie', 'Fuller', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'moving', 'country', 'Pennsylvania', 'fix', 'up', 'dilapidated', 'house', 'experience', 'pleasure', 'lots', 'pain', 'process', 'movie', 'written', 'splendidly', 'suit', 'comedic', 'skills', 'great', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'superbly', 'assisted', 'beautiful', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'When', 'Connie', 'Fuller', 'bought', 'house', 'little', 'details', 'house', 'rotten', 'floors', 'bathroom', 'water', 'roof', 'consolation', 'George', 'Washington', 'once', 'slept', 'house', 'later', 'out', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'lived', 'there', 'Compounded', 'problems', 'have', 'uncooperative', 'neighbor', 'Mr.', 'Prescott', 'Charles', 'Dingle', 'who', 'too', 'eager', 'make', 'life', 'Bill', 'Fuller', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'midst', 'Connie', 'accused', 'Bill', 'having', 'affair', 'local', 'antique', 'dealer', 'Jeff', 'Douglas', 'Harvey', 'Stephens', 'absolute', 'screwball', 'slapstick', 'everyone', 'family', 'will', 'laugh', 'way', 'end.At', 'end', 'even', 'rich', 'uncle', 'Connie', 'Stanley', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'little', 'scheme', 'help', 'Fullers', 'miserably', 'When', 'everything', 'bad', 'mysteriously', 'Fuller', 'dog', 'old', 'letter', 'boot', 'Kimber', 'discovered', 'digging', 'well', 'letter', 'George', 'Washington', 'valuable', 'enough', 'pay', 'mortgage', 'time', 'avert', 'foreclosure', 'house', 'secure', 'beautiful', 'fully', 'paid', 'just', 'time', 'arrival', 'seventeen-year', 'locusts.Some', 'favorite', 'conversation', 'movie', 'Bill', 'Connie', 'one', 'scene', 'Bill', 'Fuller', 'Connie', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'letter', 'bank', 'Connie', 'Fuller', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'bother', 'Bill', 'Then', 'Bill', 'Fuller', 'just', 'letter', 'foreclosure', 'scene', 'Connie', 'Fuller', 'Darling', 'what', 'matter', 'head', 'Bill', 'Fuller', 'nothing', 'matter', 'head', 'Connie', ""'m"", 'holding', 'only', 'head', 'left', 'family', '1.George', 'Washington', 'Slept', 'Here']",N/A

Now the fun and games start. People (usuallyJack) fall through floors, stair steps, dry wells, plus no real roof,no water, no bathrooms or closets. Great place (to burn down).
