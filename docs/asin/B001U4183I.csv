1238424,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B001U4183I,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[0, 1]","I just watched Hydra and I have to say that for a B production movie this is very good, it certainly is much better than I expected. This movie is about a group of rich men who have paid a shady business man to provide them with a hunt for the most dangerous pray, human beings. Unfortunately for them the island chosen for the hunt is home to the mythological creature hydra, I think think is an interesting twist as we then have three factions, the rich hunters, the hydra and the victims who are the movie's protagonists.One thing I like about this movie is the monster. The hydra is designed beautifully, I would have liked for it to be on screen for more of the movie, but for what we see of her it is just amazing, the computer generated monster is just amazing for such a relatively cheap production. I also like that the monster is actually a hydra, a magical creature requiring a mythic sword to kill it. There are allot of monster movies where mythological creatures have been given a semi probable explanation, radioactive waste, special condition have allowed a normal creature to grow extra large and so on, here however the hydra is magical and that makes the movie a little different and make it stand out among all the other survival horrors where a giant monster is the antagonist.I think the acting in Hydra was good, the special effects where cheesy but they work, the gore effects are just horrible, however this might make a movie okey to watch for younger audience who might enjoy the fantasy aspects of the film. Trust me parents, the ketchup your kid had on his burger for dinner looks more like blood than what is in this movie. The picture quality of this DVD is at times not the best, but it is not to bad.At times Hydra get a bit drawn out, some scenes feel unnecessary long. All in all though this is a great monster movie, it is fun, action filled and I enjoyed it allot. If you like giant monsters eating everything on two legs in a jungle then this is definitely the movie for you.",4,Now that is one hungry monster!,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,2013,"['just', 'watched', 'Hydra', 'have', 'say', 'B', 'production', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'certainly', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'movie', 'group', 'rich', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'paid', 'shady', 'business', 'man', 'provide', 'hunt', 'most', 'dangerous', 'pray', 'human', 'beings', 'Unfortunately', 'island', 'chosen', 'hunt', 'home', 'mythological', 'creature', 'hydra', 'think', 'interesting', 'twist', 'then', 'have', 'three', 'factions', 'rich', 'hunters', 'hydra', 'victims', 'who', 'are', 'movie', 'protagonists.One', 'thing', 'like', 'movie', 'monster', 'hydra', 'designed', 'beautifully', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'be', 'screen', 'more', 'movie', 'what', 'see', 'just', 'amazing', 'computer', 'generated', 'monster', 'just', 'amazing', 'relatively', 'cheap', 'production', 'also', 'monster', 'actually', 'hydra', 'magical', 'creature', 'requiring', 'mythic', 'sword', 'kill', 'are', 'allot', 'monster', 'movies', 'where', 'mythological', 'creatures', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'semi', 'probable', 'explanation', 'radioactive', 'waste', 'special', 'condition', 'have', 'allowed', 'normal', 'creature', 'grow', 'extra', 'large', 'so', 'here', 'however', 'hydra', 'magical', 'movie', 'little', 'different', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'survival', 'horrors', 'where', 'giant', 'monster', 'antagonist.I', 'think', 'acting', 'Hydra', 'was', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'where', 'cheesy', 'work', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'horrible', 'however', 'might', 'make', 'movie', 'okey', 'watch', 'younger', 'audience', 'who', 'might', 'enjoy', 'fantasy', 'aspects', 'film', 'Trust', 'parents', 'ketchup', 'kid', 'had', 'burger', 'dinner', 'more', 'blood', 'what', 'movie', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'times', 'not', 'best', 'not', 'bad.At', 'times', 'Hydra', 'get', 'bit', 'drawn', 'out', 'scenes', 'feel', 'unnecessary', 'long', 'great', 'monster', 'movie', 'fun', 'action', 'filled', 'enjoyed', 'allot', 'like', 'giant', 'monsters', 'eating', 'everything', 'two', 'legs', 'jungle', 'then', 'definitely', 'movie']",N/A

It was not forever, but more like eleven months. Still, it had a lot of expectations to live up to and I also knew the majority of Sci-Fi Channel movies can be pretty disappointing.So when it appeared on the UK listings, i watched it to decide if I should cancel my pre-order or not. Then i watched it again. Did i cancel my pre-order? No.So why not? For one thing, the movie has slower, more deliberate pacing than a lot of its predecessors. The CGI is a bit better than the average Sci-Fi Channel movies too. It's not the peak of special effects quality in such movies, but, for example, in the opening scene the hydra bites a man's leg, and that shot looks more realistic than some of the biting shots in ""Basilisk: the Serpent King"" which actually had impressive CGI (for a low-budget movie).In place of the usual Saturday morning cartoon human villain, we have... well, there's two human villains, neither of whom trust each other, and neither of whom have any leverage over the other leading to their scenes actually being interesting to watch. There's a couple of other minor villains (including the wife of one main villain), along with four hunters who do at least have more personality than the usual henchmen and are a bit more dangerous too.They didn't completely do away with the redshirt henchmen found in your average Sci-Fi Channel movie, but if they had, the monster aspect of the movie wouldn't play a part until quite a while into the film.The guy who plays Nolan does quite well; he's quite convincing as an ex-military type advising people on survival. I suspect the actor may have based his performance on that one ex=special forces guy who used to have a TV show dealing with such subjects.There's some bad points of course; mostly what stands out is an extreem act of stupidity by one of the minor characters and, er... I guess without spoiling anything, all I can say is some aspects towards the end felt a bit rushed and contrived.Another surprising aspect of competence was that not only did people (even ""redshirt henchmen"") have the sense to shoot a large carnivore in the head, but bullets actually work on this monster too! Granted, anyone familiar with the mythology could guess those two things together will only help this particular monster, but I can't really find fault with anything that means less incompetence in a Sci-Fi channel movie!",4,A lot better than expected,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,2477,"['originally', 'heard', 'movie', 'June', '2008', 'waited', 'what', 'seemed', 'like', 'forever', 'finally', 'see', 'was', 'not', 'forever', 'more', 'eleven', 'months', 'Still', 'had', 'lot', 'expectations', 'live', 'up', 'also', 'knew', 'majority', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'disappointing.So', 'when', 'appeared', 'UK', 'listings', 'i', 'watched', 'decide', 'should', 'cancel', 'pre-order', 'not', 'Then', 'i', 'watched', 'again', 'Did', 'i', 'cancel', 'pre-order', 'No.So', 'why', 'not', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'slower', 'more', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'lot', 'predecessors', 'CGI', 'bit', 'better', 'average', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'movies', 'too', 'not', 'peak', 'special', 'effects', 'quality', 'such', 'movies', 'example', 'opening', 'scene', 'hydra', 'man', 'leg', 'shot', 'looks', 'more', 'realistic', 'biting', 'shots', 'Basilisk', 'Serpent', 'King', 'actually', 'had', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'low-budget', 'movie', '.In', 'place', 'usual', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'human', 'villain', 'have', 'well', 'two', 'human', 'villains', 'whom', 'trust', 'other', 'whom', 'have', 'leverage', 'other', 'leading', 'scenes', 'actually', 'being', 'interesting', 'watch', 'couple', 'other', 'minor', 'villains', 'including', 'wife', 'one', 'main', 'villain', 'four', 'hunters', 'who', 'do', 'least', 'have', 'more', 'personality', 'usual', 'henchmen', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'dangerous', 'too.They', 'did', ""n't"", 'completely', 'do', 'away', 'redshirt', 'henchmen', 'found', 'average', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'movie', 'had', 'monster', 'aspect', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'part', 'while', 'film.The', 'guy', 'who', 'Nolan', 'quite', 'well', 'quite', 'convincing', 'ex-military', 'type', 'advising', 'people', 'survival', 'suspect', 'actor', 'may', 'have', 'based', 'performance', 'one', 'ex=special', 'forces', 'guy', 'who', 'used', 'have', 'TV', 'show', 'dealing', 'such', 'bad', 'points', 'course', 'mostly', 'what', 'out', 'extreem', 'act', 'stupidity', 'one', 'minor', 'characters', 'er', 'guess', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'can', 'say', 'aspects', 'end', 'felt', 'bit', 'rushed', 'contrived.Another', 'surprising', 'aspect', 'competence', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'people', 'even', 'redshirt', 'henchmen', 'have', 'sense', 'shoot', 'large', 'carnivore', 'head', 'bullets', 'actually', 'work', 'monster', 'too', 'Granted', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'mythology', 'could', 'guess', 'two', 'things', 'together', 'will', 'only', 'help', 'particular', 'monster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'fault', 'anything', 'less', 'incompetence', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'movie']",N/A

1238429,AIBSC3DOO3UHR,B001U4183I,"John B. Connor ""dragonsandsuch""","[2, 2]","Warning: Spoilers in this review.The premise of this movie was pretty good: four rich hunters paying through the nose to hunt human prey on a remote island in the middle of nowhere. Things go ary when one of the hunted turns out to be a former special forces soldier, and even more so when it turns out that there is a muti-headed monster on teh island eating everyone it encounters. It is the type of movie I'd like to see made by a big budgeted and competent crew.Unfortunately, it was not. Even so, I was able to look beyond the poor special effects and the nearly as poor acting, as the story itself was interesting. Even the improbable, like the fact that the captain was not even a little bit curious why none of his crew would return to the ship after going ashore, was at least mildly dealt with, if unconvincingly.What lost it for me, however, was the magic sword ending. Come on. They couldn't come up with anything better then the ""Sword of Hercules"" saving the day? Even Hercules himself did not use a magic sword with his mythological fight with the hydra. After he chopped off a head, he seared the wound with molten lead.

Somehow this creature winds up on an island in the middle of nowhere, in Hydra (2009), an extremely silly train wreck of a monster flick, that is mostly entertaining for the wrong reasons.Entrepreneur Vincent Camden (Alex McArthur) and his wife (Jana Williams), are the sponsors of a unique venture that involves four wealthy men, who have experienced personal tragedies.  Seeking a twisted outlet for their frustrations, each man has committed to pay ten million dollars, to participate in a death hunt, involving four criminals kidnapped to serve as prey.  Camden, his clients, and the imprisoned victims are aboard a large ship, when the captain (Michael Shamus Wiles) locates a suitable island to stage the event.Tim Nolan (George Stults) and Gwen Russell (Dawn Olivieri) are among the prisoners deposited on the island.  Four hunters arrive later, and the hunt begins.  There is however an unexpected participant.  The Hydra has already feasted on an archeological expedition, leaving Dr. Valerie Cammon (Polly Shannon) running for her life.  With fresh meat on the island it isn't long before the Hydra begins to feast.The creature is entirely a CGI creation, and though obviously fake, looks decent enough.  It specializes in surrounding its victims, chomping down on heads, and ripping bodies apart.  While such gore is a always a fun thing, it does become a little repetitive.  Guns don't work too well, as true to myth, destroying a head causes two more to grow back.  The only weapon that is effective, is an ancient sword discovered hidden in a cave.  Believing the threat has been defeated, the survivors return to the ship, but there is time for one last feeding frenzy.Hydra is just idiotic fun, with a totally dumb story, and lots of bad acting.  Michael Shamus Wiles his overacting meter set on high.  The mysterious volcanic island setting is preposterous, the dialog ridiculous, and the pretentious cardboard characters mostly unlikeable.
