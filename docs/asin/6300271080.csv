I mean one may never see the racial issues as they saw them back then, but there are many people of all ages who may go through relationships with someone they considered quite significant only to find that the other had relationships elsewhere that could or did create lasting or nowadays fatal concerns.

237141,AESFW5DZC2XO7,6300271080,"Matthew C. Stelly ""Global Genius""","[45, 47]","This movie is a classic because it is real. Not only is the setting incredible, but the clothing, the speeech patterns and the general atmosphere make ""The Learning Tree"" a potentially powerful and impactful learning tool as swell.Its the 1920s south and there isn't one black person who doesn't have a grandparent or a great grandparent who doesn't remember those times. The acting in this movie leaves a great deal to be desired, but the story is so powerful that you can relate ot every character. Newt, the young boy (Gordon Parks as a child) is polite, considerate and curious. The movie begins with him lsoing his virginity to a much older person, a young woman who rescues him from a tornado.How Parks pulled off that storm is a wonder to me, because if I'm not mistaken this flick pre-dates the kind of special effects that we see in ""Twister."" But then agian, they used it in the ""Wizard of Oz,"" so I guess it must be a director's secret.The key to this movie is that a young boy grows up, falls in love, learns about life when hsi girlfriend runs off with a thug, witnesses a murder and has to decide if he should tell or not. The man who commits the murder is the father of a young bully that Newt always had problems with. THe racism of the sheriff of the town and how black kids were used back then is a key part of the story.This movie is a treasure. No black studies department or ethnic studies program should be without it. The ""learning"" that young Newt attained transcended the classroom, but began with a loving family, all sticking together no matter what the odds. That love spread throughout the community. I'm not sure if race relations during that time were as amicable as this movie makes them appear, but the black community of today could learn some lessons from the community that was depicted in ""The Learning Tree.""This movie, like ""Raisin in the Sun,"" ""Imitation of Life,"" ""Sounder,"" ""Man and Boy"" and ""The Spook Who Sat By the Door"" should be mandatory teaching tools for all high school students, black and white.",5,The Learning Tree: As Pure as the African-American Spirit,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,2047,"['movie', 'classic', 'real', 'Not', 'only', 'setting', 'incredible', 'clothing', 'speeech', 'patterns', 'general', 'atmosphere', 'make', 'Learning', 'Tree', 'potentially', 'powerful', 'impactful', 'learning', 'tool', 'swell.Its', '1920s', 'south', ""n't"", 'one', 'black', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'grandparent', 'great', 'grandparent', 'who', ""n't"", 'remember', 'times', 'acting', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'be', 'desired', 'story', 'so', 'powerful', 'can', 'relate', 'ot', 'character', 'Newt', 'young', 'boy', 'Gordon', 'Parks', 'child', 'polite', 'considerate', 'curious', 'movie', 'lsoing', 'virginity', 'much', 'older', 'person', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'tornado.How', 'Parks', 'pulled', 'off', 'storm', 'wonder', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'flick', 'kind', 'special', 'effects', 'see', 'Twister', 'then', 'agian', 'used', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'guess', 'must', 'be', 'director', 'secret.The', 'key', 'movie', 'young', 'boy', 'up', 'love', 'life', 'when', 'hsi', 'girlfriend', 'thug', 'murder', 'decide', 'should', 'tell', 'not', 'man', 'who', 'murder', 'father', 'young', 'bully', 'Newt', 'always', 'had', 'problems', 'THe', 'racism', 'sheriff', 'town', 'how', 'black', 'kids', 'were', 'used', 'back', 'then', 'key', 'part', 'story.This', 'movie', 'treasure', 'black', 'studies', 'department', 'ethnic', 'studies', 'program', 'should', 'be', 'learning', 'young', 'Newt', 'attained', 'transcended', 'classroom', 'began', 'loving', 'family', 'sticking', 'together', 'matter', 'what', 'odds', 'love', 'spread', 'community', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'race', 'relations', 'time', 'were', 'as', 'amicable', 'movie', 'appear', 'black', 'community', 'today', 'could', 'learn', 'lessons', 'community', 'was', 'depicted', 'Learning', 'Tree', 'movie', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'Sounder', 'Man', 'Boy', 'Spook', 'Who', 'Sat', 'Door', 'should', 'be', 'mandatory', 'teaching', 'tools', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'black', 'white']",N/A
