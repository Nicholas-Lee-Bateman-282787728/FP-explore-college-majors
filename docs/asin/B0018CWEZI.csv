The characters are both funny and easy to relate to.  Addison Montgomery is even better than when she was on Grey's Anatomy because she is no longer second fiddle to Derek or Meredith.

It's fantastic and addictive and funny and so enjoyable.  If I'm going to be completely honest, the main reasons I began watching this is because of Tim Daley and Taye Diggs.  Especially Tim - he's so cute.  But I found myself getting really involved with the story lines and the characters and now have a new favourite show.After the initial episode of seeing the crossover from Greys to Private, we see the first episode called In Which We Meet Addison, a Nice Girl From Somewhere Else (all the episodes are called In Which ...) where she joins the Oceanside Wellness Group where she was offered a job.  The clinic is mostly owned by one of her best friends in college.  One of the other workers there is Dr Pete Wilder (Tim Daley) who throughout the season, she has a strong strong chemistry with.  It makes for very interesting situations.  Some of the episodes are written by Shondra Rhimes so they still have a Greys feel to them.I have to say that I really like this more than Greys.  The characters are all fantastic and complex and that helps make this show great.  I'm so lucky that I got to see a lot of this when I was in America last year because as usual, Australia is behind the rest of the world with most things and I have no clue when we are getting this.
