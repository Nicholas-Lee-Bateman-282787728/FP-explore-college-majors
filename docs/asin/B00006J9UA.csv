I particularly like his approach - he's a story teller as opposed to terse punchy jokes.  For example, he'll talk about what if the pope is an action hero and he has ""altar boy"" (pronounced as if he's saying ""batman and robin""). He goes on about how that would work and the strange things they'd do.  So obviously if you have any sensitivities, he's not for you.  But the stories evolve magically; he tends to take very familiar situations and make them immensely comical.  For example - at the end of Circle, he does the Death Star Canteen bit.  So what if the Death Star had a cafeteria and Darth Vader were to go for chow?

When I say this album isn't 'top form', it is in comparison to other works he has done. Eddie Izzard on his worst day is still better than 95% of the comedians out there on their best, so keep this in mind.Circle is a great album that uses religion and history as one running gag. Just when you think that the content has segued away from religion on some bizarre tangent, it comes racing back to draw inevitable conclusions between Jesus and say... dinosaurs..I don't really want to go into too much detail here, nor should you read any review that does if you haven't yet heard the album. That's the trouble with comedy albums; they are far too easy to spoil without meaning to.If you are a fan of Eddie's work, do not hesitate for a moment to buy this album. I own all of his albums and will keep buying them as they come out.However, if you are new to Eddie.. This album is a good starting point if you are a big fan of the British style of dry wit and subtle humor.
