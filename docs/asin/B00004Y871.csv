I would have loved to have some of that great music which included a song from Madonna that was written specifically for this movie.  Just never made sense that a soundtrack was never released.  You can purchase the Madonna song ""Live to Tell"". This is the kind of movie where people like Sean Penn or Christopher Walken should have won Academy awards and I would understand why.

The criminal father is played by Walken but not as you've seen him in the movies before.  Usually Walken plays top crime figures in major US cities. I've gotten very tired of seeing him in that role, in fact.  However, here he is a hick and a criminal. His crimes are anything and everything that will get him through the night.  The fascinating part is that Walken's character is more horrific than a mafia crime boss because he has no rules or limits whatsoever in his narrow, primitive world.  He will harm anyone or anything, including kith or kin, who gets in his way.  At times Walken seems like an ordinary bloke you'd see at your neighborhood tavern yet, in others, he is quietly chilling. Penn, as his son, is caught in a number of different directions as he's coming of age.  Penn's character is sufficiently young and unformed and he could still turn out good or bad as an adult. It could go either way.  However, what catalyzes him into growing up even faster is that his father undertakes his most vicious acts yet, acts that cry out for justice.  Just to show you how young Penn was in this movie, he was then married to Madonna and she sings the big song on the movie soundtrack! The scene I can never forget is the one where Walken puts his finger up to his mouth, signalling &quot;quiet,&quot; in almost a playful fashion. He has just committed his most atrocious crime to date and that is how laid back he is about it.",5,Penn and Walken Terrific Together,979948800,"01 20, 2001",2001,1553,"['film', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'saddled', 'father', 'mired', 'low', 'level', 'living', 'constant', 'crime', 'criminal', 'father', 'played', 'Walken', 'not', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'Usually', 'Walken', 'top', 'crime', 'figures', 'major', 'US', 'cities', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'very', 'tired', 'seeing', 'role', 'fact', 'However', 'here', 'hick', 'criminal', 'crimes', 'are', 'anything', 'everything', 'will', 'get', 'night', 'fascinating', 'part', 'Walken', 'character', 'more', 'horrific', 'mafia', 'crime', 'boss', 'rules', 'limits', 'whatsoever', 'narrow', 'primitive', 'world', 'will', 'harm', 'anyone', 'anything', 'including', 'kith', 'kin', 'who', 'way', 'times', 'Walken', 'ordinary', 'bloke', ""'d"", 'see', 'neighborhood', 'tavern', 'yet', 'others', 'quietly', 'chilling', 'Penn', 'son', 'caught', 'number', 'different', 'directions', 'coming', 'age', 'Penn', 'character', 'sufficiently', 'young', 'unformed', 'could', 'still', 'turn', 'out', 'good', 'bad', 'adult', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'However', 'what', 'growing', 'up', 'even', 'faster', 'father', 'most', 'vicious', 'acts', 'yet', 'cry', 'justice', 'Just', 'show', 'how', 'young', 'Penn', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'then', 'married', 'Madonna', 'big', 'song', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'scene', 'can', 'never', 'forget', 'one', 'where', 'Walken', 'finger', 'up', 'mouth', 'signalling', 'quot', 'quiet', 'quot', 'almost', 'playful', 'fashion', 'just', 'committed', 'most', 'atrocious', 'crime', 'date', 'how', 'laid', 'back']",N/A
558661,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00004Y871,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 7]","If this movie weren't so good, it would be unbearable. As it is, it's good enough to overcome a slow pace and a plot so depressing you might ask yourself, ""Why am I still watching?""The story is simple enough. A young man, Brad Whitewood, Jr. (Sean Penn) is a kid with no future, just spinning his wheels. He lives in a rural Pennsylvania town with his younger brother (Chris Penn), his mother and his grandmother. Every now and then his father, Brad, Sr. (Christopher Walken) shows up in a flashy car with a flashy woman to toss some money on the table. Brad, Sr. runs a gang and makes his cash by stealing. Young Brad sees a way out, maybe to a future. He also yearns for the approval and love of a father he never saw much of. Brad meets a young woman, Terry (Mary Stuart Masterson) and they fall in love. He leads his own gang of juvenile delinquents. He hooks up with his father, who gradually brings him into the real business. Then he sees a stool pigeon killed. Brad may be a thief, but he's not a killer. His father, on the other hand, is both. Brad, Sr. soon takes steps to insure that no one can testify against him when the law gets close. The last quarter of the movie is tough to watch.The movie is almost two hours long and, in my opinion, drags during the first half. The look of the film says rural poverty. There are broken-down cars in the front yards and trash in the streets. People don't say much during supper; they're too involved watching the television. So why do I like the movie? First, the story line has the trajectory of a major drama. You may know nothing good is going to happen to anyone who comes under Brad, Sr.'s influence, but the yearning for approval by Brad, Jr. puts things into major emotional territory. Second, all the actors give strong performances. Masterson is so appealing as a young woman who falls in love and simply wants what her lover wants. Sean Penn, except for a few high drama scenes when he falls into ""acting,"" does a first-rate job as Brad, Jr. Penn is excellent at showing Brad's almost inarticulate feelings. Most importantly, he's convincing as a guy who could easily end up idolizing a really bad man and who is able finally to find his own strength of character. Christopher Walken, however, is what makes the movie. This is not Walken as an over-the-top bad guy. Brad, Sr. is a charming man, a sort of dangerous good-old-boy without the big gut. Charming as he is, he also is evil, a man without a conscience, prepared to kill anyone who may be a danger to him. Walken brings the movie to life.As much as I was drawn to the story and as much as I admired the performances, I'm not sure how many times I'd want to watch this film. It doesn't leave a nasty taste in your mouth, but you sure are happy you were never born into the Whitewood family or its environs.The DVD transfer is just fine. There are no extras of any importance.",4,"A Sad, Murderous Movie With An Excellent Performance By Christopher Walken",1137196800,"01 14, 2006",2006,2897,"['movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'unbearable', 'good', 'enough', 'overcome', 'slow', 'pace', 'plot', 'so', 'depressing', 'might', 'ask', 'Why', 'am', 'still', 'watching', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'A', 'young', 'man', 'Brad', 'Whitewood', 'Jr.', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'kid', 'future', 'just', 'spinning', 'wheels', 'rural', 'Pennsylvania', 'town', 'younger', 'brother', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'now', 'then', 'father', 'Brad', 'Sr.', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'up', 'flashy', 'car', 'flashy', 'woman', 'toss', 'money', 'table', 'Brad', 'Sr.', 'gang', 'cash', 'stealing', 'Young', 'Brad', 'way', 'maybe', 'future', 'also', 'approval', 'love', 'father', 'never', 'saw', 'much', 'Brad', 'young', 'woman', 'Terry', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'fall', 'love', 'own', 'gang', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'up', 'father', 'who', 'gradually', 'real', 'business', 'Then', 'stool', 'pigeon', 'killed', 'Brad', 'may', 'be', 'thief', 'not', 'killer', 'father', 'other', 'hand', 'Brad', 'Sr.', 'soon', 'steps', 'insure', 'one', 'can', 'testify', 'when', 'law', 'close', 'last', 'quarter', 'movie', 'tough', 'watch.The', 'movie', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'opinion', 'drags', 'first', 'half', 'look', 'film', 'rural', 'poverty', 'are', 'broken-down', 'cars', 'front', 'yards', 'trash', 'streets', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'supper', ""'re"", 'too', 'involved', 'watching', 'television', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'movie', 'First', 'story', 'line', 'trajectory', 'major', 'drama', 'may', 'know', 'nothing', 'good', 'going', 'happen', 'anyone', 'who', 'Brad', 'Sr.', 'influence', 'yearning', 'approval', 'Brad', 'Jr.', 'things', 'major', 'emotional', 'territory', 'Second', 'actors', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'Masterson', 'so', 'appealing', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'simply', 'what', 'lover', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'few', 'high', 'drama', 'scenes', 'when', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'job', 'Brad', 'Jr.', 'Penn', 'excellent', 'showing', 'Brad', 'almost', 'inarticulate', 'feelings', 'Most', 'importantly', 'convincing', 'guy', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'end', 'up', 'idolizing', 'really', 'bad', 'man', 'who', 'able', 'finally', 'find', 'own', 'strength', 'character', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'however', 'what', 'movie', 'not', 'Walken', 'over-the-top', 'bad', 'guy', 'Brad', 'Sr.', 'charming', 'man', 'sort', 'dangerous', 'good-old-boy', 'big', 'gut', 'Charming', 'also', 'evil', 'man', 'conscience', 'prepared', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'danger', 'Walken', 'movie', 'life.As', 'much', 'was', 'drawn', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'admired', 'performances', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'film', ""n't"", 'leave', 'nasty', 'taste', 'mouth', 'sure', 'are', 'happy', 'were', 'never', 'born', 'Whitewood', 'family', 'environs.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'just', 'fine', 'are', 'extras', 'importance']",N/A
558662,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00004Y871,David Baldwin,"[34, 34]","The film purports to be based on true events.  The saga of the Johnston gang, a ""family"" of burglars based in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and reigned circa 1980 and then unfolded into murder happened while I was in high school.  The story got big play in the Philadelphia region and some national coverage.  Oddly enough this movie was filmed in Tennessee.  Also noteworthy is that when this film was released in 1986 it didn't even get a theatrical run in Philly.  I had to wait until it was released later that year on home video before I saw it.  Bear in mind that at the time Sean Penn was not the esteemed Academy award winning actor he is now but was better known as Madonna's husband.  Christopher Walken, despite the Oscar he won for ""The Deer Hunter"", was a marketing challenge for Hollywood.  As for the film itself, it perfectly captures the essence of the events and the place it occurred.  I worked near Lancaster County around that time and my late brother-in-law was from the area and came to Philly because the mills had closed there.  You can imagine if you were a young person at that time the desolation you might feel and Penn perfectly captures that restlessness.  You can also imagine how someone like him would be drawn to a charismatic, albeit evil, father figure as assayed here by Walken.  Walken's Brad Sr. is one of his great portrayals in an impressive career.  With little histrionics or tics Walken embodies evil incarnate.  There is also an excellent supporting cast here with Mary Stuart Masterson as Penn's innocent girlfriend, Chris Penn and Crispin Glover as Penn's buddies, and Tracey Walter as Walken's brother as standouts.  This is most definitely one of the better and more underrated films of the eighties.

What were Academy Award voters thinking when they overlooked this still emotionally overwhelming and potent little film, reportedly based on a true story, that covers the entire spectrum of familial morality?  Sean Penn (""Brad Jr."") and Christopher Walken (""Brad Sr."") deliver Oscar-level performances, seemingly elevating each other in a kind of theatrical symbiosis, creating their own Hollywood blueprint on how great acting is done.  Few characters in cinematic history have run the gamut of emotions that Penn's Brad Jr. does here, and Walken is unarguably one of the scariest characters you'll ever see on screen (and that includes the horror-movie genre).  Brad Jr.'s parents are divorced, and he and his younger half-brother ""Tommy"" (the late Christopher Penn, Penn's real-life little brother, who's also in top form) must decide between their estranged Dad's morally questionable but monetarily tempting lifestyle (organized crime), and their Mom's less-than-perfect and melancholy but nevertheless generally safe home.  Are there conditions when it comes to their loyalty to their Dad, or will it be futile to resist their Dad's influence under any circumstances, whatever they may be?  The basis of the movie, ironically, is their Dad confronting the same questions about his sons.  Throw in the rest of the A-list cast, including Mary Stuart Masterson (as Brad Jr.'s girlfriend ""Terry,"" her career-best performance), Kiefer Sutherland (TV's ""24,"" but if you blink, you may miss him), Crispin Glover (""Back to the Future""), and a cameo appearance by Alan Autry (""Bubba"" from TV's ""In the Heat of the Night""), along with a perfectly haunting score by Madonna (the movie's theme song ""Live to Tell"" topped the charts), and you have a gripping, suspenseful, effective powerhouse that will very likely exceed your expectations.",5,Has to go down as one of the most underrated movies in cinematic history!,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,1966,"['Admittedly', 'high', 'chill', 'factor', 'one', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'watch', 'not', 'tastes', 'then', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'What', 'were', 'Academy', 'Award', 'voters', 'thinking', 'when', 'overlooked', 'still', 'emotionally', 'overwhelming', 'potent', 'little', 'film', 'reportedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'entire', 'spectrum', 'familial', 'morality', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Brad', 'Jr.', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Brad', 'Sr.', 'deliver', 'Oscar-level', 'performances', 'seemingly', 'elevating', 'other', 'kind', 'theatrical', 'symbiosis', 'creating', 'own', 'Hollywood', 'blueprint', 'how', 'great', 'acting', 'done', 'Few', 'characters', 'cinematic', 'history', 'have', 'run', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'Penn', 'Brad', 'Jr.', 'here', 'Walken', 'unarguably', 'one', 'scariest', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'screen', 'horror-movie', 'genre', 'Brad', 'Jr.', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'younger', 'half-brother', 'Tommy', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Penn', 'Penn', 'real-life', 'little', 'brother', 'who', 'also', 'top', 'form', 'must', 'decide', 'estranged', 'Dad', 'morally', 'questionable', 'monetarily', 'tempting', 'lifestyle', 'organized', 'crime', 'Mom', 'less-than-perfect', 'melancholy', 'nevertheless', 'generally', 'safe', 'home', 'Are', 'conditions', 'when', 'loyalty', 'Dad', 'will', 'be', 'futile', 'resist', 'Dad', 'influence', 'circumstances', 'may', 'be', 'basis', 'movie', 'ironically', 'Dad', 'confronting', 'same', 'questions', 'sons', 'Throw', 'rest', 'A-list', 'cast', 'including', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'Brad', 'Jr.', 'girlfriend', 'Terry', 'career-best', 'performance', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'TV', '24', 'blink', 'may', 'miss', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'Back', 'Future', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Alan', 'Autry', 'Bubba', 'TV', 'Heat', 'Night', 'perfectly', 'haunting', 'score', 'Madonna', 'movie', 'theme', 'song', 'Live', 'Tell', 'topped', 'charts', 'have', 'gripping', 'suspenseful', 'effective', 'powerhouse', 'will', 'very', 'likely', 'exceed', 'expectations']",N/A

Brad meets Terry, a naive 16 year old who falls for him but is definitely not prepared for the lifestyle he wants to adopt--his Dad's.  As the story continues, things get more tense.  Everything doesn't work out right and family ties get broken.  The movie is intense and one scene is embarrassing--the 16 yr old Terry among hardened criminals.  Before everything starts going bad Terry and Brad sneak out and get together with Brad's friends at a quarry and go swimming.  It looks like alot of fun...inner tubes, diving from ledges, smoking pot, drinking beer and living it up.  It's the last good time they'll have.

558672,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00004Y871,J from NY,"[1, 2]","Director James Foley probably didn't have to try too hard with this grim, all too real slice of life starring Sean Penn (Bruce Whitewood Jr.) and Christopher Walken (Brad Whitewood Sr.).Taking place in an impoverished small town in the center of Nowheresville, a hopeless little plot of land populated with drifters, aimless young men like Bruce (a young, built Sean Penn) and his slightly punchy young brother Tommy played by the late Chris Penn with an innocence and skill that makes his early death all that much more tragic.In exactly 111 minutes Christopher Walken shows us what evil men look like in real life.  And how boring, empty, and absolutely dangerous they are.  From his arrival on the scene, green eyes snapping back and forth like some hungry lizard looking for the next fly he intends to digest with one flicker of his forked tongue, there is not a second that one can doubt we are looking at Satan himself--and surprisingly enough, he's driven by a lot of the same motives we are.Mary Stuart Masterson symbolizes the will to transcend her modest surroundings as Terry, a nice and idealistic young girl Bruce falls in love with.  Though this is an adolescent romance, there is more of a strength and maturity to it because it is born in poverty and hardship and is not a luxurious middle class game of playing house.  Bruce is of course the bad boy from a family married to crime--what struck me about the film is how passive the mother is, simply ironing the clothes and chain smoking while her sons become enamored of Old Dad, who she knows is Beelzebub himself.  She doesn't really do anything except give passively angry looks at Walken and play bingo.With no prospects of moving ahead or doing anything with his life whatsoever, Bruce falls under the spell of his father--magnetic, dangerous, lawless and without care for the next day (as long as the stolen tractors, wine, etc pay the bills).  He learns quickly though that Dad is not just some mischevious thief, not a free spirit, when he witnesses the murder of one of his fallen comrades who fell in cahoots with the police.This is when the trouble starts.  Bruce no longer wants anything to do with his father or his backwoods gang of psychopathic hillbillies.  Just like a deep sea predator, there is a unforgettable scene in which Bruce takes Tommy from the county fair to a wooded area and, surrounded by darkness, tells him an inverse sort of anti-parable about coyotes out in the west.  His eyes flicker with a demonic emptiness, a secret joy in the boy's fear, right before he does away with him and we hear the scream of a coyote.While the ending is a little unrealistic--I don't think getting shot nine times allows one the physical freedom Sean Penn as he confronts the Old Man--it serves as a definite period, a definite final verdict on the elder  Bruce, as though we totally needed one.  The guy has had all his friends killed, tried to have him killed, and when confronted by all this his response is: ""Well, I bought you a car and took ya in.  Doesn't that mean something'?""  Younger Bruce has nothing to contend with except a dangerous animal lacking in conscience or anything else, and that's his own father.Crispin Glover really should get more career breaks.  He is such a naturally diseased and frightening eccentric that I think he's owed more credit then he's gotten.  His short time in this film sort of proves it.  A magnificent movie that also reminds us of our obligation toward the very real flesh and blood human beings who we like to laugh at when they are exploited on shows like ""Jerry Springer",5,Evil is boring,1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,3603,"['Director', 'James', 'Foley', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'grim', 'too', 'real', 'slice', 'life', 'starring', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Bruce', 'Whitewood', 'Jr.', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Brad', 'Whitewood', 'Sr.', '.Taking', 'place', 'impoverished', 'small', 'town', 'center', 'Nowheresville', 'hopeless', 'little', 'plot', 'land', 'populated', 'drifters', 'aimless', 'young', 'men', 'Bruce', 'young', 'built', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'slightly', 'punchy', 'young', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'played', 'late', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'innocence', 'skill', 'early', 'death', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'tragic.In', 'exactly', '111', 'minutes', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'what', 'men', 'look', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'boring', 'empty', 'absolutely', 'dangerous', 'are', 'arrival', 'scene', 'green', 'eyes', 'snapping', 'back', 'forth', 'hungry', 'lizard', 'looking', 'next', 'fly', 'digest', 'one', 'flicker', 'forked', 'tongue', 'not', 'second', 'one', 'can', 'doubt', 'are', 'looking', 'Satan', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'driven', 'lot', 'same', 'are.Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'will', 'transcend', 'modest', 'surroundings', 'Terry', 'nice', 'idealistic', 'young', 'girl', 'Bruce', 'love', 'adolescent', 'romance', 'more', 'strength', 'maturity', 'born', 'poverty', 'hardship', 'not', 'luxurious', 'middle', 'class', 'game', 'playing', 'house', 'Bruce', 'course', 'bad', 'boy', 'family', 'married', 'crime', 'what', 'struck', 'film', 'how', 'passive', 'mother', 'simply', 'ironing', 'clothes', 'chain', 'smoking', 'sons', 'become', 'enamored', 'Old', 'Dad', 'who', 'Beelzebub', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'give', 'passively', 'angry', 'looks', 'Walken', 'play', 'bingo.With', 'prospects', 'moving', 'ahead', 'doing', 'anything', 'life', 'whatsoever', 'Bruce', 'spell', 'father', 'magnetic', 'dangerous', 'lawless', 'care', 'next', 'day', 'as', 'long', 'stolen', 'tractors', 'wine', 'etc', 'pay', 'bills', 'quickly', 'Dad', 'not', 'just', 'mischevious', 'thief', 'not', 'free', 'spirit', 'when', 'murder', 'one', 'fallen', 'comrades', 'who', 'fell', 'cahoots', 'police.This', 'when', 'trouble', 'Bruce', 'no', 'longer', 'anything', 'do', 'father', 'backwoods', 'gang', 'psychopathic', 'hillbillies', 'Just', 'deep', 'sea', 'predator', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'Bruce', 'Tommy', 'county', 'fair', 'wooded', 'area', 'surrounded', 'darkness', 'inverse', 'sort', 'anti-parable', 'coyotes', 'out', 'west', 'eyes', 'flicker', 'demonic', 'emptiness', 'secret', 'joy', 'boy', 'fear', 'right', 'away', 'hear', 'scream', 'coyote.While', 'ending', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'getting', 'shot', 'nine', 'times', 'one', 'physical', 'freedom', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Old', 'Man', 'definite', 'period', 'definite', 'final', 'verdict', 'elder', 'Bruce', 'totally', 'needed', 'one', 'guy', 'had', 'friends', 'killed', 'tried', 'have', 'killed', 'when', 'confronted', 'response', 'Well', 'bought', 'car', 'took', 'ya', 'Does', ""n't"", 'mean', 'something', 'Younger', 'Bruce', 'nothing', 'contend', 'dangerous', 'animal', 'lacking', 'conscience', 'anything', 'else', 'own', 'father.Crispin', 'Glover', 'really', 'should', 'get', 'more', 'career', 'breaks', 'such', 'naturally', 'diseased', 'frightening', 'eccentric', 'think', 'owed', 'more', 'credit', 'then', 'gotten', 'short', 'time', 'film', 'sort', 'proves', 'magnificent', 'movie', 'also', 'obligation', 'very', 'real', 'flesh', 'blood', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'like', 'laugh', 'when', 'are', 'exploited', 'shows', 'Jerry', 'Springer']",N/A

558676,A3KUUII2GSHN7T,B00004Y871,"Joel Munyon ""Joel Munyon""","[5, 10]","Let me first say that Sean Penn made this film. It certainly doesn't hurt when you add Chris Walken into the mix. But this movie had to be one of the weirdest, most bizarre films I've ever seen. Screen shots come and go seemingly without ryhme or reason. Dialogue is sometimes difficult to decipher - especially Walken's. Many scenes feel rushed. Sometimes you find yourself laughing when its really not a funny scene. But you can't help it, mainly because some of the scenes are just really friggin weird.Once scene in particular deals with Crispin Glover, Keifer Sutherland, Mary Stuart Masterson, Sean Penn, Chris Penn(at about 1/2 his Resevoir Dogs size) and the imbecilic laughing horndog of a kid from Fright Night (Stephen Geoffreys). They're all out smoking hash by a lake. You see Masterson's character and Penn's character making out on a raft - and we also see Glover looking jealous - but we never find out why. This type of thing happens quite frequently. Many elements are never explained and many scenes make no sense - such as a scene when David Straithairn's (blind guy from Sneakers, abusive dad from Dolores Claiborne) character goes into an epileptic fit. I liked the scene, as it was well acted, it just doesn't make any sense.You can quickly assert the campiness of this film and I now know why it's a ""pulp indie"" on IFC. I really liked the film, and to imagine the film without the senseless parts(which consumes about 50% of the movie) would be to disembowel it all altogether.As for plot, a teen(Penn) just meets his father(Walken) for the first time, only, daddy's a full-time criminal who likes to steal tractors, boats, paintings, and occasionally off an former associate or two. He runs with a gang of heartless rednecks who also share in his malevolent ways. Dad thinks its time to bring in his boy but after his son watches his father and another man drown a former associate, the teen decides he wants out. Our protagonist decides he wants to take off with his girlfriend(Masterson) after being released from jail. Only......I don't want to spoil it. But let's just say the final portion of the film isn't rushed and makes perfect sense. All in all, a worthwhile film. But don't be surprised if you find yourself questioning major portions of the screenplay and the annoying soundtrack that plays like a garage band at a funeral - in other words, it doesn't go with the movie at all, helping cumulate more and more oddities about the movie while making you laugh in perplexity.3.5 out of 5 for campiness and taking a huge risk for its day.

Released in 1985, it was likely the father-son dynamic (almost Shakespearean in scope) of the real events that appealed to Hollywood screenwriters. It certainly wasn't the happy ending.Penn plays Brad Whitewood Jr., a jobless teenager living with his grandmother (played by Penn's real-life mother Eileen Ryan), brother Tommy (real-life brother, the late Christopher Penn), and mother. As evidenced in the opening scenes, when Brad hangs onto the hood of a speeding car, Brad is looking for something exciting in any possible form. A budding relationship with farm girl Terry (Mary Stuart Masterson) is a start, but it is Brad's father, Brad Sr. (Walken), re-entering his life that provides him with the jolt he's been looking for. Brad Sr. is a complete snake; a career thief, simultaneously charming and psychopathic. Soon, Brad Jr. begins working alongside his father before finding himself in much deeper than he expected. Crispin Glover and Kiefer Sutherland co-star as two of Brad Junior's loser associates.While billed as a ""thriller,"" the film is much more of a ""human drama."" The characters, despite being based on real people, don't feel one-hundred percent real, but they're not caricatures either. It is the characters and the way they are portrayed that really carries the film, not the plot. A film with a storyline this familiar can hardly be called ""thrilling.""Sean Penn is brilliant, in a performance that is much more subtle than the bravado he displayed in his Oscar-winning roles. It's a quietly moving performance that is just as rewarding as those performances were.Walken delivers one of the greatest performances of his career, balancing both charisma and terror in a way few actors could. He completely embodies the character, making every aspect of Brad Sr. believable. It's chilling and equals the intensity of his Oscar-winning performance in The Deer Hunter. Undoubtedly, Oscar-worthy work here.My two biggest issues with the film are the musical score and the final shot. The score makes the film feel more dated than it would be without it and it's also somewhat repetitive. The final shot is a freeze-frame effect that has been a cinematic clich&eacute; since Truffaut'sThe 400 Blows - Criterion Collectionoriginated it.Excluding that shot and the preceding courtroom scene, the last few minutes of the film are the most powerful, due to the searing on-screen intensity of Penn and Walken. The film seems to be heading towards an inevitable conclusion, but throws the audience a curveball and manages to achieve a sort of emotional poignancy. In terms of story and substance, At Close Range is nothing special or profound. It's certainly not perfect, but these last ten minutes are taut, suspenseful, and very powerful. The kitchen scene with Penn and Walken is one of the finest examples of intense acting, something I believe few would argue.Though it's not immediately apparent, At Close Range is a powerful, performance-driven human drama.

However, Brad is getting sick of his boring life, and longs to make some serious money. Brad's father (Christopher Walken) is the leader of a serious gang of thieves. Brad has heard the rumors about his father, but never got a chance to know him. So he decides to leave his boring life behind, and sets out to find his father so that he can learn the tricks of the trade and become just like him. At first, Brad's father appears to be a good guy filled with plenty of wisdom and helpful hints on how to make it big. But when Brad witnesses his father intentionally kill someone, he realizes that he may be in over his head.&quot;At Close Range&quot; is a great film. The story is based on the real life story of killer Bruce Johnson. With the acception of the character's names being chaged, the film features an accurate interpretation of events. It is truly a shame that no one really knows about this film. It features a powerful and emotional tale of an American criminal family. The film is very captivating and draws you in from the beginning. The story is great because it combines a somewhat touching look at a son getting to know his father, with an extremely well thought out crime story. This film emphasizes the term &quot;appearances can be deceiving&quot; because as the story goes on, Brad begins to learn what type of man his father really is.  There is also a nice romance aspect to the story because Sean Penn's character meets and falls for a woman played by Mary Stuart Masterson.Sean Penn and Christopher Walken offer two of their finest performances in this film, which is another reason why it is a shame that no one knows about this movie. &quot;At Close Range&quot; shows that Sean Penn was a great actor before &quot;Mystic River&quot;. He nails the role with his perfect portrayal of being rebellious and naive at the same time. Christopher Walken is great because he plays both the loving father and the hardened criminal so well. Walken's performance in this film will give you the creeps. It really was the perfect role for him. Overall, I would place &quot;At Close Range&quot; at the top of the &quot;unknown gem&quot; category. This film is probably one of the best crime films I have ever seen.

Along the way, Penn realizes what a terrible person his father is and tries to leave the gang.  Walken is not liking that idea and has a different plan for Penn, one which involves his lovely girlfriend, played by Mary Stuart Masterson.Chris Penn is also in this movie and plays Sean Penn's younger brother(that must have been diffcult for him).This movie is sooooo great, because of Walken.  His performance is undeniably creepy and overly effective.  His character is drunk and doped-up for the entire movie and is always hiding his ""evil"" side.  Walken is so capable of pulling this off, that it is impossible for me to even consider who else would have played this role had he not.This movie is a little slow-moving, but that is simply to set the depressing, un-eventful daily life that takes place in this farm town this movie is set in.  It almost explains why Penn gets involved with his father's crew---shear boredom.There is some humor in ths film, most of which is provided by a drunk Walken character, stumbling and rambling about life.The best line is when Penn tells Walken that he no longer wants to work with him and Walken; in a typical Walken voice, utters ""Where ya gonna go...what'd ya gonna do....Food, clothes, pretty girl in your lap...you'll be crawling back to me; Daddy, Daddy, give me something""..I can rewind and watch that scene for hours.This is truely a fantastic film and I highly recommend this one to anyone.

Been there, done that.What makes this movie memorable is the setting (rural Pennsylvania, as far as I could tell) and its excellent deromanticizing of the criminal life.  Consider it an anti-Godfather film;  instead of the luscious sepia-toned interiors and National Geographic ethnic-portrait, period quality of Coppola's masterpiece, this is plain ol' America, this is the 70's, and this is crass, ordinary, everyday crime.It's the same thing, really:  Brad Whitewood Senior is a wannabe Godfather, but he's being shown without the ritual and romance of the Sicilian tradition.  He's just a brutal, amoral thief, and his gang are all of the same stamp.His son, already on his way to some kind of trouble in a going-nowhere back-of-beyond small town, is fascinated by  Dad.  Dad has money, Dad has fast cars.  Dad has the keys to the good life;  at home there's just Mom and Mom's downer boyfriend who gets upset if you smoke dope and make a racket at night when the rest of the family wants to sleep.  What's a troubled teen to do?  Run away to Dad, of course.Walken does a terrific job as the charismatic but snake-evil Whitewood Senior.  Though the accent seems to slip a bit at times, he has the charm and the blarney and the musical, (self)hypnotizing delivery of the practised con man.  Penn is well-cast as the not-too-bright boy with ambitions beyond his abilities.  The supporting cast is solid. The cinematography is a style and era that I find very enjoyable.I was disappointed by the kitschy &quot;back from the dead&quot; ending. Admittedly, we can glimpse that the gunman sent to wipe out the last witness against dear old Dad is Patch, the most incompetent crook ever born;  so it figures he would mess up even something so simple as a gangland shooting.  But the heroic &quot;bullet-ridden boy drags self across country to confront bad guy&quot; sequence left me skeptical and bored rather than riveted.  Based on a true story or not, it was hard to take.Right up until that moment I was hooked, and I would have been fine with the film ending on the long still shot of the car sitting by the silent farmhouse in the night.  However, we had to have the final confrontation, and I give the film makers credit for letting Whitewood Jr. pass his final moral test:  rather than  putting Dad away for good in the family tradition, he votes for law and order and chooses to testify in court.  The courtroom scene at the end was for me more tense, and more genuinely moving, than the kitchen confrontation scene (though I admit the line &quot;Is this the family gun?&quot; was a winner!)I give the film makers full marks for resisting the usual cloying Daddy/Sonny reconciliation schlock (probably typified at its saccharine worst in Lucas' Star Wars saga), instead voting for Sonny's eyes at last opening to the fact that Daddy is irredeemably wicked.One thing that's a bit bothersome is the strongly implied rape of Whitewood Jr's girlfriend by Whitewood Sr.  The incident is handled without a lot of exploitative detail, yet it's also quietly buried in the plot.  We never know if the kid finds out about this;  did she ever tell him?  would she ever have told him?  It certainly destroys any lingering shred of sympathy we might ever have had for Daddy, but the way it disappears completely from the plot is somehow disturbing, as if it was of no consequence in the end.Well portrayed throughout is the appalling ignorance and gullibility of young boys, and their vulnerability to any kind of opportunistic manipulator.  The film works well, I should think, as an antidote to any appeal that the life of crime might have for an adolescent viewer.  It's a sharp, harsh moral tale about the kind of people you get involved with in that line of work, and though it's a lesser achievement than Coppola's classic, I have to admit that it is ethically a better work;  it does not lure the viewer into sympathizing and identifying with ruthless criminals, instead it more sanely encourages us to see them as they are and pity or despise them.It also paints a convincing portrait of the kind of dead-end rural poverty and semi-poverty that can make the life of crime seem dangerously attractive.  Very American, very realistic, quite suspenseful, and of course Walken is revelling in his  character's villainy and loopy, sociopathic, treacherous charm; the film would be worth the price of admission just to enjoy his performance.

Based on a true story of the Johnston family crimes. The name was changed for dramatic purposes to Whitewood.Sean Penn plays young Brad Jr who is lured by Brad Sr, played remarkably by Walken, into his gang of thieves. When Brad Jr finds out that the gang does more than just steal, but also murder, he decides to walk out leading the movie to the very frightful and haunting events that followed.The movie was nominated only for a Berlin International Film Festival award.

558694,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B00004Y871,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[4, 5]","""At Close Range"" is a classic example of a movie in which all aspects of the filmmaker's art shine; if it isn't already, it should be required viewing for students in film schools. First of all, the Kazan script, which details the growing into manhood of the Sean Penn character, skillfully combines the luridly violent with the ultimately noble, its resolution having Penn, without his becoming a goody two-shoes, credibly endorse the virtues of the civilized over the flashy and brutish.The color photography, unexpected in a neo-noir film, works remarkably well as it turns out, being consistently beautiful (in the rural landscapes) and imaginative (for example, in its scenes of the gang members marching single file, silhouetted against a dusky sky.) Each image in the film appears to have been composed with great aesthetic care, reminding this viewer of the directorial art of such a master as William Wyler.The acting in this movie can't be praised highly enough. Christopher Walken, always good as a villian with a sarcastic bent, here outdoes himself as a self-centered father, doing evil not for its own sake, but for HIS own sake. As his initially impressionable and then maturing son, Sean Penn combines a youth's brooding qualities with an astonishing ability as an adult male to scream and even cry on screen, becoming intensely moving in such moments.As earlier reviewers have insisted, this film deserves to be far better known.",5,"""Hands Down,  A  Winner""",1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,1446,"['Close', 'Range', 'classic', 'example', 'movie', 'aspects', 'filmmaker', 'art', 'shine', ""n't"", 'already', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'students', 'film', 'schools', 'First', 'all', 'Kazan', 'script', 'details', 'growing', 'manhood', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'character', 'skillfully', 'luridly', 'violent', 'ultimately', 'noble', 'resolution', 'having', 'Penn', 'becoming', 'goody', 'two-shoes', 'credibly', 'virtues', 'civilized', 'flashy', 'brutish.The', 'color', 'photography', 'unexpected', 'neo-noir', 'film', 'remarkably', 'well', 'out', 'being', 'consistently', 'beautiful', 'rural', 'landscapes', 'imaginative', 'example', 'scenes', 'gang', 'members', 'marching', 'single', 'file', 'silhouetted', 'dusky', 'sky', 'image', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'composed', 'great', 'aesthetic', 'care', 'reminding', 'viewer', 'directorial', 'art', 'master', 'William', 'Wyler.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'praised', 'highly', 'enough', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'always', 'good', 'villian', 'sarcastic', 'bent', 'here', 'self-centered', 'father', 'doing', 'evil', 'not', 'own', 'sake', 'HIS', 'own', 'sake', 'initially', 'impressionable', 'then', 'maturing', 'son', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'youth', 'brooding', 'qualities', 'astonishing', 'ability', 'adult', 'male', 'scream', 'even', 'cry', 'screen', 'becoming', 'intensely', 'moving', 'such', 'moments.As', 'earlier', 'reviewers', 'have', 'insisted', 'film', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'known']",N/A

This slice of no-hope rural oedipal noir was based on a true story. Sean Penn, barely out of his teens and incendiary, is a bored teen in small-town, depressed Pennsylvania farm country, living with his indolent mom and younger bro (played by real-life bro, the late, lamented Chris Penn). Bored out of his skull, with no prospects, Sean is tantalized by fleeting glimpses of his dad, who abandoned him back in toddlerhood, but who periodically stops by to dispense wads of cash to his estranged wife, keeping contact with his son to a minimum.  Dad, as is evident by his clothes, the cash, his swagger and his car, is some kind of rural bandit. And he is played by Christopher Walken, to the absolute hilt, in one of the most menacing, hilarious, kitsch-free depictions of villainy I have ever seen. The narrative proper gets going when Walken takes a fancy to his forgotten son, to the point where he initiates him into his criminal world (which seems to consist mostly of hijacking high-end farm equpiment and selling drugs).  Penn, thrilled at the money, excitement, and filial bonding, is swept up into dad's heady orbit...until it begins to dawn on him that there are worse things than being fatherless...like having a dad who is a predatory homicidal maniac.Magnificent script by Nick Kazan, son of Elia, who in the late '80's early '90's specialized in literate, offbeat true crime stories like this, ""Reversal of Fortune,"" and ""Patty Hearst."" James Foley (""GlenGary Glen Ross"") directs beautifully, paying great attention to the no-hope depressed rural environment. Supporting performances are fabulous, from Tracy Walter's Walter Brennan-like gangster underling, to Crispin Glover and Chris Penn as the stoner kids who get carried away into a life of crime and pay a dear price, to the stunning Mary Stewart Masterson as Sean's tough-as-nails tomboy girlfriend.  Penn himself is his usual smoldering self, but it is Walken who makes this a must-see; too often self-parodic, here is is absolutely believable, from his cocksure swagger, to his peculiar but convincing Appalachian accent (""a little Elvis, a little Muhammed Ali,"" he explained in an interview), to his habit of smiling sweetly to himself when he kills people. The story of a man who discovers the joys of fatherhood belatedly, until it gets in the way of what really matters to him, the story of a fatherless boy whose belated reunion with his father goes from rapture to nightmare: this is not merely a true-crime movie, but an archtypal tragedy, and everyone involved should take a bow -- even Madonna, then in her Penn-days, who delivers a terrific title song with the downbeat ""Live to Tell.""",5,"""Is this the family gun, dad?""
