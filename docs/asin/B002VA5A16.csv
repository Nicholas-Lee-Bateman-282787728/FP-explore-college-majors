The owner of the lodge is about to sell the place because of the strange happenings that went on in previous years--all due to a hermit named ""Hermin"" who can't stand the holiday. The owner has a brat nephew named ""Snively,"" who joins Hermin and together they try and really put an end to the ""Christmas Carnival"" and ruin everyone's holiday. Anyway, Yogi comes along and rescues the day, albeit accidentally, and the lodge is saved.YOGI'S FIRST CHRISTMAS is a feature length film with singing, dancing, and Yogi and Boo-Boo are joined by other Hanna-Barbera stars like ""Snagglepuss,"" ""Auggie and Daddy Doggie,"" ""Huckleberry Hound,"" and ""Cindy Bear.""It's a charming and fun filled movie that you can share with your family and watch each and every Christmas or whenever you need to lift your spirits up.The picture quality is pretty good, sharp and clean with vibrant color, but there was a scene where the color was a little washed out. But no biggie.Someone was asking whether or not the ""Cindy Bear"" musical number was still in the picture where she's singing about being under the mistletoe and kissing Yogi, and it is!",5,Still A *Classic* Cartoon & Must For The Holidays!,1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,1636,"['Even', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'ofThe', 'Yogi', 'Bear', 'Show', 'Complete', 'Series', 'love', 'Christmas', 'special.I', 'saw', 'YOGI', 'FIRST', 'CHRISTMAS', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'touched', 'heart', 'so', 'much', 'remembered', 'well', 'adulthood.I', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'so', 'purchased', 'immediately.The', 'story', 'Yogi', 'Boo-Boo', 'who', 'get', 'wakened', 'winter', 'hibernation', 'when', 'Jellystone', 'Lodge', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'Carnival', 'music', 'bustling', 'disturbs', 'rest', 'owner', 'lodge', 'sell', 'place', 'strange', 'happenings', 'went', 'previous', 'years', 'due', 'hermit', 'named', 'Hermin', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'holiday', 'owner', 'brat', 'nephew', 'named', 'Snively', 'who', 'Hermin', 'together', 'try', 'really', 'put', 'end', 'Christmas', 'Carnival', 'ruin', 'everyone', 'holiday', 'Anyway', 'Yogi', 'along', 'rescues', 'day', 'accidentally', 'lodge', 'saved.YOGI', 'FIRST', 'CHRISTMAS', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Yogi', 'Boo-Boo', 'are', 'joined', 'other', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'stars', 'Snagglepuss', 'Auggie', 'Daddy', 'Doggie', 'Huckleberry', 'Hound', 'Cindy', 'Bear', 'charming', 'fun', 'filled', 'movie', 'can', 'share', 'family', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'whenever', 'need', 'lift', 'spirits', 'up.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'sharp', 'clean', 'vibrant', 'color', 'there', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'color', 'was', 'little', 'washed', 'out', 'biggie.Someone', 'was', 'asking', 'not', 'Cindy', 'Bear', 'musical', 'number', 'was', 'still', 'picture', 'where', 'singing', 'being', 'mistletoe', 'kissing', 'Yogi']",N/A

1291397,A1F7YU6O5RU432,B002VA5A16,Angela Streiff,"[5, 5]","Being a kid in the 1980's, each year at Christmas time there were a series of shows that would play on TV that kids got to see once a year. Every year I remember it being a BIG deal when they were finally on and everyone would call each other on the phone to tell them what channel to find it on.While the years of seeing a program just once a Holiday are over, the nostalgia of this childhood memory still lives in this program. There were several shows each Holiday season. Peanuts (A Charlie Brown Christmas), Jetson's Christmas, Flintstone's Christmas, Frosty the Snowman and of course Rudolph were all shows we eagerly awaited, but Yogi's First Christmas was my all time favorite.For years I didn't realise it was called Yogi's First Christmas. There were so many Hanna Barbera characters in it, that I wasn't sure the exact name. Finally after some searching last Christmas I found it.This is the one where the Ranger, Yogi, Boo Boo, and all the other Hanna Barbera characters work at a lodge for Christmas to keep it open. Snively, the wealthy and spoiled nephew of the lodge owner visits for Christmas and almost spoils the Holiday. Yogi, usually well into hibernation at that time, tries his best to stay awake so he can see his very first Christmas day, and as usual saves the day.When watching it, it really brings back memories of what cartoons were like back in the 1980's. The graphics are nothing like today's cartoons, but every time I watch it it's like being 6 years old and eagerly awaiting Santa all over again.",5,The Christmas show I grew up with!,1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,1531,"['Being', 'kid', '1980', 'year', 'Christmas', 'time', 'were', 'series', 'shows', 'would', 'play', 'TV', 'kids', 'got', 'see', 'once', 'year', 'year', 'remember', 'being', 'BIG', 'deal', 'when', 'were', 'finally', 'everyone', 'would', 'call', 'other', 'phone', 'tell', 'channel', 'find', 'years', 'seeing', 'program', 'just', 'once', 'Holiday', 'are', 'nostalgia', 'childhood', 'memory', 'still', 'program', 'were', 'several', 'shows', 'Holiday', 'season', 'Peanuts', 'A', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'Jetson', 'Christmas', 'Flintstone', 'Christmas', 'Frosty', 'Snowman', 'course', 'Rudolph', 'were', 'shows', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'Yogi', 'First', 'Christmas', 'was', 'time', 'favorite.For', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'was', 'called', 'Yogi', 'First', 'Christmas', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'Hanna', 'Barbera', 'characters', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'exact', 'name', 'Finally', 'searching', 'last', 'Christmas', 'found', 'it.This', 'one', 'where', 'Ranger', 'Yogi', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'other', 'Hanna', 'Barbera', 'characters', 'work', 'lodge', 'Christmas', 'keep', 'open', 'Snively', 'wealthy', 'spoiled', 'nephew', 'lodge', 'owner', 'visits', 'Christmas', 'almost', 'spoils', 'Holiday', 'Yogi', 'usually', 'well', 'hibernation', 'time', 'best', 'stay', 'awake', 'can', 'see', 'very', 'first', 'Christmas', 'day', 'usual', 'day.When', 'watching', 'really', 'back', 'memories', 'what', 'cartoons', 'were', 'like', 'back', '1980', 'graphics', 'are', 'nothing', 'today', 'cartoons', 'time', 'watch', 'being', '6', 'years', 'old', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'Santa', 'over', 'again']",N/A

The movie is cute, about Yogi and Boo Boo waking up from hibernation in time to participate in Christmas events, with Yogi getting a job after accidentally rescuing the owner of a ski lodge, and then a series of promotions until eventually he's the manager(!)  There's a lot of fun songs and some subtle humor for adults.  Fans of older cartoons will be glad to see old friends like Huckleberry Hound ((oh, my darling Clementine...) Snagglepuss, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy and the Ranger of Jellystone Park.  Cindy Bear eventually arrives and learns of the Christmas tradition of kissing under the mistletoe and decides to hang some all over the room so she can ""catch"" Yogi, and it's fun watching him do everything he can to get away--although Cindy does earn herself a sweet kiss in the end...The other movie where the romance between Yogi and Cindy finally gets some attention is Hey There, It's Yogi Bear, which is my personal favorite.  A very cute tale where yogi and boo Boo must travel cross-country to rescue Cindy from an evil circus owner.
