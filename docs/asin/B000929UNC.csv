899740,A1E9SNNS24DA02,B000929UNC,"Amazon Customer ""chickenlittle25""","[1, 1]","This dvd has so much wonderful information in it that even a rank beginner can follow along if they go through the glossary a few times.  I had to deduct two stars because the instructor is facing you, and when she gives you queues, for example, to move to the right--she is moving to HER right, which is your left.  Two stars might sound like a lot to deduct, but it makes learning very difficult and this is an issue in many dance videos that people  have complained about this sort of backwards instruction, most companies have finally corrected for it, so I'm surprised this nonsense is still being done.  Especially since her queueing is mainly done with voice-overs, I would think that she'd see what was happening and would have corrected for it.  If this dvd was made over again with proper instructions I'd have to give it 5 stars.If you can train yourself to listen to her talking about form, and what steps to perform and ignore the direction, or if you're one of those people who can do the opposite of what the person on the screen is doing, then you will have no trouble at all.  The instructions are clear.  The pace is fast, especially for a beginner, but after doing it a few times it doesn't seem as frantic as it does the first few times I tried to follow along.  The camera stays where it should be which is wonderful, and there is so much information in this dvd that it's definitely worth the money.",3,Great instruction if you don't listen to her queues.,1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,1421,"['dvd', 'so', 'much', 'wonderful', 'information', 'even', 'rank', 'beginner', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'go', 'glossary', 'few', 'times', 'had', 'deduct', 'two', 'stars', 'instructor', 'facing', 'when', 'queues', 'example', 'move', 'right', 'moving', 'HER', 'right', 'left', 'Two', 'stars', 'might', 'sound', 'lot', 'deduct', 'learning', 'very', 'difficult', 'issue', 'many', 'dance', 'videos', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'sort', 'backwards', 'instruction', 'most', 'companies', 'have', 'finally', 'corrected', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'nonsense', 'still', 'being', 'done', 'Especially', 'queueing', 'mainly', 'done', 'voice-overs', 'would', 'think', ""'d"", 'see', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'would', 'have', 'corrected', 'dvd', 'was', 'made', 'over', 'again', 'proper', 'instructions', ""'d"", 'have', 'give', '5', 'stars.If', 'can', 'train', 'listen', 'talking', 'form', 'what', 'steps', 'perform', 'ignore', 'direction', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'opposite', 'what', 'person', 'screen', 'doing', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'instructions', 'are', 'clear', 'pace', 'fast', 'especially', 'beginner', 'doing', 'few', 'times', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'frantic', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'tried', 'follow', 'along', 'camera', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'wonderful', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'dvd', 'definitely', 'worth', 'money']",N/A

I thought this DVD would reinforce what we have been learning. However, it didn't reinforce even one step at the beginning level.  It seems like it would be great when you get to the hard-shoe level.  However, we are both still working with Ghillies (soft-shoe) and I didn't see her teach one dance step that we have learned in a basic Reel.I was also a bit disappointed in the music.  I was expecting traditional pipes and just couldn't seem to get into... what at times seemed like Asian music that didn't fit the dance.If you are a dancer that is more advanced than we are, then this might be great. However, if you are a novice like we are, then I would look into purchasing some of the DVDs that are offered on some of the Irish dance and piping websites.",2,Not for a beginner.,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,901,"['bought', 'DVD', 'daughter', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'Irish', 'Dance', 'classes', 'year', 'extremely', 'reputable', 'touring', 'dance', 'group', 'thought', 'DVD', 'would', 'reinforce', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'learning', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'reinforce', 'even', 'one', 'step', 'beginning', 'level', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'when', 'get', 'hard-shoe', 'level', 'However', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'Ghillies', 'soft-shoe', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'teach', 'one', 'dance', 'step', 'have', 'learned', 'basic', 'Reel.I', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'music', 'was', 'expecting', 'traditional', 'pipes', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'what', 'times', 'seemed', 'Asian', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'dance.If', 'are', 'dancer', 'more', 'advanced', 'are', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'However', 'are', 'novice', 'are', 'then', 'would', 'look', 'purchasing', 'DVDs', 'are', 'offered', 'Irish', 'dance', 'piping', 'websites']",N/A

Ms. Butler is exceptionally accomplished and a pleasure to watch. As some reviewers have noted, the instruction is not especially basic or beginner-oriented. But I think it's worth noting that this is, per its title, a Master Class, which implies (at least to me) some small level of experience on the part of the students.",5,Master Class,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,415,"[""'ve"", 'viewed', 'DVD', 'numerous', 'times', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'progress', 'quite', 'well', 'technique', 'Ms.', 'Butler', 'exceptionally', 'accomplished', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'instruction', 'not', 'especially', 'basic', 'beginner-oriented', 'think', 'worth', 'noting', 'title', 'Master', 'Class', 'least', 'small', 'level', 'experience', 'part', 'students']",N/A
899746,A223UJ9MON2Y8N,B000929UNC,"Snape42 ""Toad, esq.""","[24, 27]","I have read the reviews of this DVD and I found them to be mixed, but I purchased this DVD anyway because I have always wanted to learn Irish Dance.  I am 30 years old, I have never had a dance lesson in my life, and there are no Irish Dance classes where I live.  I found this DVD to be excellent!  Jean Butler has divided up the steps and techniques into individual DVD chapters, so you can learn as you go.  You also can spend as much time as you need on any technique.  This is a DVD you have to commit to.  If you hope to learn Irish dance within the 100 minutes of DVD time, then you will probably be dissappointed unless you are already very adept at the craft.  If you are like me, and you have no previous experience, then you will be working very hard to master each individual section, but it is very doable.  I spend over a week just improving on one technique, and that is just what you have to do with this DVD.  You have to treat it as though you were going to Irish dance class.  It takes baby steps to learn to walk, and that is just what you have to do here.  Jean shows you what to do, but then it is up to you to practice until you can do it well.  There is everything on this DVD: from soft shoe (or barefoot, if you prefer) dancing, up to the very advanced hard shoe techniques.  I am no where near ready for the hard shoes, but I hope to work to that point.  Also, this DVD has excellent warm-up and core excercises.  I thought I was in fairly descent shape until I started some of the core exercises, and then I realized I had a lot of improvment to work on - which this DVD encourages.  Just seeing Jean and the other professionals break into their routines is enough to encourage me to keep pressing through the techniques and the exercises.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in this dance.  And if you are like me, and do not have the benefit of Irish dance classes being taught in your community, this DVD brings those classes to you, and what better teacher could you possibly have than Jean Butler?",5,Excellent - even for a spastic klutz!,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,2043,"['have', 'read', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'found', 'be', 'mixed', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'anyway', 'have', 'always', 'wanted', 'learn', 'Irish', 'Dance', 'am', '30', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'dance', 'lesson', 'life', 'are', 'Irish', 'Dance', 'classes', 'where', 'live', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'excellent', 'Jean', 'Butler', 'divided', 'up', 'steps', 'techniques', 'individual', 'DVD', 'chapters', 'can', 'learn', 'go', 'also', 'can', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'need', 'technique', 'DVD', 'have', 'commit', 'hope', 'learn', 'Irish', 'dance', '100', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'time', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'dissappointed', 'are', 'already', 'very', 'adept', 'craft', 'are', 'have', 'previous', 'experience', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'working', 'very', 'hard', 'master', 'individual', 'section', 'very', 'doable', 'spend', 'week', 'just', 'improving', 'one', 'technique', 'just', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'DVD', 'have', 'treat', 'were', 'going', 'Irish', 'dance', 'class', 'baby', 'steps', 'learn', 'walk', 'just', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'here', 'Jean', 'what', 'do', 'then', 'up', 'practice', 'can', 'do', 'well', 'everything', 'DVD', 'soft', 'shoe', 'barefoot', 'prefer', 'dancing', 'up', 'very', 'advanced', 'hard', 'shoe', 'techniques', 'am', 'where', 'near', 'ready', 'hard', 'shoes', 'hope', 'work', 'point', 'Also', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'warm-up', 'core', 'excercises', 'thought', 'was', 'fairly', 'descent', 'shape', 'started', 'core', 'exercises', 'then', 'realized', 'had', 'lot', 'improvment', 'work', 'DVD', 'Just', 'seeing', 'Jean', 'other', 'professionals', 'break', 'routines', 'enough', 'encourage', 'keep', 'pressing', 'techniques', 'exercises', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'interested', 'dance', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'benefit', 'Irish', 'dance', 'classes', 'being', 'taught', 'community', 'DVD', 'classes', 'what', 'better', 'teacher', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'Jean', 'Butler']",N/A
