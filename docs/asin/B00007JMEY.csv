However, the drawings are a total departure from the simplicity of the original. That rough and innocent look in some ways demonstrates the delicate power of the original's script that made it so appealing and heartwarming. But there's enough warmth of the heart to go around in this one that most viewers shouldn't be disappointed. I suppose that if you grew up with the original you may still yearn for that beloved simply told tale. But remember that was your day.

729612,A3GRU9732S4V1U,B00007JMEY,"Robert Jenkins ""video geek #1""","[15, 16]","We bought this DVD as an Easter present for our kids.  My wife and I both have very fond memories of the original, and I was curious to see how this one stacked up.  I really didn't think it was a bad movie at all.  It concerns the continuing adventures of Wilbur the pig, Templeton the rat, and the rest of the barnyard critters of the original, including Charlotte's three children that we met at the end.  There's a new baby lamb on the farm, Cardigan, who is ostracized from the other sheep because of his black fur.  Wilbur, a pig who definitely knows the value of friendship, takes the lamb under his wing (so to speak).  When a trip to the good old county fair results in Cardigan being sold to a neighboring farmer, Wilbur's concerns for his friend leads him, Templeton, and Charlotte's daughters on an adventure to find their friend.The animation of the movie is very well done, much better than most direct-to-video releases, and the background paintings and such were also well done.  In that regard, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The voice-over acting was fairly faithful to the original, although I must admit to missing Paul Lynde as Templeton.  The songs in the movie are OK but nothing particularly outstanding.  I did notice, however, that time has been kind to Wilbur, melting quite a bit of weight off of him and giving him a nice cute patch of fluffy hair on top of his head.  Fern, Wilbur's human friend and savior from the original, also appears to have gotten younger, and her friend Henry Fussy is nowhere in sight.Basically, this is a cute movie, but it is nowhere near the absolutely stellar quality of the first.  If you are someone, like me, who remembers the original fondly and think this might be a good movie for your kids, don't be afraid to pick it up.  Your kids will enjoy it.  However, if you are thinking that it will be as much of a classic as the original, I am afraid you will be disapponted.  Still, all in all, it is a decent movie on its own.",3,"Not bad, but not up to the original",1051056000,"04 23, 2003",2003,1990,"['bought', 'DVD', 'Easter', 'present', 'kids', 'wife', 'have', 'very', 'fond', 'memories', 'original', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'stacked', 'up', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'continuing', 'adventures', 'Wilbur', 'pig', 'Templeton', 'rat', 'rest', 'barnyard', 'critters', 'original', 'including', 'Charlotte', 'three', 'children', 'met', 'end', 'new', 'baby', 'lamb', 'farm', 'Cardigan', 'who', 'ostracized', 'other', 'sheep', 'black', 'fur', 'Wilbur', 'pig', 'who', 'definitely', 'value', 'friendship', 'lamb', 'wing', 'so', 'speak', 'When', 'trip', 'good', 'old', 'county', 'fair', 'results', 'Cardigan', 'being', 'sold', 'neighboring', 'farmer', 'Wilbur', 'concerns', 'friend', 'Templeton', 'Charlotte', 'daughters', 'adventure', 'find', 'friend.The', 'animation', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'direct-to-video', 'releases', 'background', 'paintings', 'such', 'were', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'regard', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'voice-over', 'acting', 'was', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'original', 'must', 'admit', 'missing', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'Templeton', 'songs', 'movie', 'are', 'OK', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'did', 'notice', 'however', 'time', 'been', 'kind', 'Wilbur', 'melting', 'quite', 'bit', 'weight', 'giving', 'nice', 'cute', 'patch', 'fluffy', 'hair', 'top', 'head', 'Fern', 'Wilbur', 'human', 'friend', 'savior', 'original', 'also', 'have', 'gotten', 'younger', 'friend', 'Henry', 'Fussy', 'nowhere', 'sight.Basically', 'cute', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'quality', 'first', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'original', 'fondly', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'pick', 'up', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'However', 'are', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'classic', 'original', 'am', 'afraid', 'will', 'be', 'disapponted', 'Still', 'decent', 'movie', 'own']",Charlotte's Web 2 - Wilbur's Great Adventure
