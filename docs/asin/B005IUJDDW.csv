1462026,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B005IUJDDW,D.P.,"[6, 6]","Nina Cleary's (Amy Smart) father recently died with his last wish being to bring his three sons of suspended cop Sam (John Cena) & bail bondsman Leo (Ethan Embry) & ex-con Douglas (Boyd Holbrook) together so as a condition of his will, they will each collect an inheritance of $3 million if they were to run a family business together for two years.  There is clear tension between Sam & Rico as they haven't seen each other in a decade while the youngest one in Douglas had never met any of his siblings previously.  Meanwhile, a couple of hitmen take a corporation owner in Kyle Wills (Gregg Henry) hostage into Mexico with one of the kidnappers being identified as Leo's bailjumper named Edgar (Rio Alexander) who left him in debt, the brothers are convinced to go find him & get the reward money.  In Mexico, they run into various issues such as getting information from Edgar's famous girlfriend who just happens to have an eye for Douglas, a drug lord named Verdugo (J.D. Garfield) who tells them to leave town or be killed, the kidnappers trying to kill them, meeting up with a woman named Theresa Trujillo (Lela Loren) who ends up having a common enemy with the boys, and the brothers trying to tolerate each other throughout the entire venture.I will say that I've enjoyed this movie more than the recent WWE films releases as the attempts at comedy/action were good & not overdone.  This was a different movie than Cena's previous two are he did more acting here than we've seen from his previous two action based movies (""The Marine"" & ""12 Rounds"") while everyone else played their parts well so this is a movie I would watch more than a second time & recommend for a viewing.",4,Can $3 Million Unite A Dysfunctional Family?,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,1687,"['Nina', 'Cleary', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'father', 'recently', 'died', 'last', 'wish', 'being', 'bring', 'three', 'sons', 'suspended', 'cop', 'Sam', 'John', 'Cena', 'bail', 'bondsman', 'Leo', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'ex-con', 'Douglas', 'Boyd', 'Holbrook', 'together', 'so', 'condition', 'will', 'will', 'collect', 'inheritance', '3', 'million', 'were', 'run', 'family', 'business', 'together', 'two', 'years', 'clear', 'tension', 'Sam', 'Rico', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'decade', 'youngest', 'one', 'Douglas', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'siblings', 'previously', 'Meanwhile', 'couple', 'hitmen', 'take', 'corporation', 'owner', 'Kyle', 'Wills', 'Gregg', 'Henry', 'hostage', 'Mexico', 'one', 'kidnappers', 'being', 'identified', 'Leo', 'bailjumper', 'named', 'Edgar', 'Rio', 'Alexander', 'who', 'left', 'debt', 'brothers', 'are', 'convinced', 'go', 'find', 'get', 'reward', 'money', 'Mexico', 'run', 'various', 'issues', 'such', 'getting', 'information', 'Edgar', 'famous', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'eye', 'Douglas', 'drug', 'lord', 'named', 'Verdugo', 'J.D', 'Garfield', 'who', 'leave', 'town', 'be', 'killed', 'kidnappers', 'trying', 'kill', 'meeting', 'up', 'woman', 'named', 'Theresa', 'Trujillo', 'Lela', 'Loren', 'who', 'up', 'having', 'common', 'enemy', 'boys', 'brothers', 'trying', 'tolerate', 'other', 'entire', 'venture.I', 'will', 'say', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'recent', 'WWE', 'films', 'attempts', 'comedy/action', 'were', 'good', 'not', 'overdone', 'was', 'different', 'movie', 'Cena', 'previous', 'two', 'are', 'did', 'more', 'acting', 'here', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previous', 'two', 'action', 'based', 'movies', 'Marine', '12', 'Rounds', 'everyone', 'else', 'played', 'parts', 'well', 'so', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'recommend', 'viewing']",N/A

1462031,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B005IUJDDW,MadMacs,"[1, 1]","I stun myself when I keep saying this: The WWE produces some decent-to-excellent flicks. They're all action of course; but there is, amazingly, an underlying strength of story and plot in their productions. Don't care if it's formulaic. They're spot on and entertaining. Which is a far cry from the astounding amount of pretentious, ridiculous and generally worthless films that are pooped out every year from all corners of the globe.John Cena, likeDwayne JohnsonandSteve Austin, has the abilities to become a full-fledged actor. Like his compatriots, he projects much more than his biceps; I'm talking for-real thespian skills. Now, obviously, we're not discussing a run toward an Oscar. But I won't diminish the solid efforts of these performers simply because their background is in the form of a canvas mat and not a New York or London acting studio.And the consistent ironic element when I review their films: I can't stand professional wrestling. &lt;g>In this production, Cena plays one of four siblings - three brothers and a sister. They, like the classic tv show 'Bonanza' (which is often referred to by the characters), have the same father but were born to different mothers. And each one is completely unlike the others.The first born brother is a hot-tempered police officer, recently suspended from the job for constantly manhandling the perps and skels. Second in line is a wannabe businessman who looks and acts more like a con-man. Their kid brother is a thief, but a young man with a very gentle and kind soul. And their sister is the only 'normal' one out of the bunch. Although the film doesn't delve into her character, it's apparent that she is the only sibling who leads a typically average life.They've reunited after many years of separation, mostly by choice and one instance of circumstance, to bury their father and collect on a $12 million dollar inheritance. The older brothers just want to receive their share of the money and get away from each other as soon as possible. However, and you knew this was coming, there's a catch. Their filial sister has been named executor of the estate. And she has every intention of fulfilling their father's last wish - that all his children get back together to form a successful business. One that has to function for two years before the inheritance can be distributed.This forces the siblings together, whether they like it or not; obviously more the latter less the former. Clearly not the ideal situation to form an enterprise, much less a successful one.Still, as the eldest, Cena, having recently been suspended again from the force, is without a paycheck. His weasel brother is in hock up to his eyeballs. And his newly discovered baby brother was recently released from prison. He decides that perhaps this might be a way to earn some coin during his official conduct review, which honestly does not bode well for him or his police career. So, if they have to work with one another for the next couple of years, they decide bounty hunting is a business they can all contribute toward. And they even have a job ready at hand.Brother number two, played by funny Ethan Embry, is a bail bondsman who laid out his last penny getting a serious scumbag out on provisional release. No surprise, the convict disappeared. And if the runner doesn't show up for his court appearance, he's out $50K.But what seems like a straight-forward skip trace, quickly escalates into a much bigger problem. While on bail release, it turns out their bail jumper played a key role in the kidnapping of a billionaire. This exacerbates a simple mission into something much more complicated - and the problems associated with the kidnapping, which includes an attempted assassination of the brothers, get progressively worse.While 'Reunion' isn't an award contender, and it's clearly not intended for that audience, it's obviously meeting the demands of the action/comedy market. And speaking as one cinephile - I enjoyed it enough to justify a rental fee.",3,Meets The Demands Of The Action/Comedy Market,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,4007,"['stun', 'when', 'keep', 'saying', 'WWE', 'decent-to-excellent', 'flicks', ""'re"", 'action', 'course', 'amazingly', 'underlying', 'strength', 'story', 'plot', 'productions', 'Do', ""n't"", 'care', 'formulaic', ""'re"", 'spot', 'entertaining', 'Which', 'far', 'cry', 'astounding', 'amount', 'pretentious', 'ridiculous', 'generally', 'worthless', 'films', 'are', 'pooped', 'out', 'year', 'corners', 'globe.John', 'Cena', 'likeDwayne', 'JohnsonandSteve', 'Austin', 'abilities', 'become', 'full-fledged', 'actor', 'compatriots', 'projects', 'much', 'more', 'biceps', ""'m"", 'talking', 'for-real', 'thespian', 'skills', 'Now', 'obviously', ""'re"", 'not', 'discussing', 'run', 'Oscar', 'wo', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'solid', 'efforts', 'performers', 'simply', 'background', 'form', 'canvas', 'mat', 'not', 'New', 'York', 'London', 'acting', 'studio.And', 'consistent', 'ironic', 'element', 'when', 'review', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'lt', '>', 'production', 'Cena', 'one', 'four', 'siblings', 'three', 'brothers', 'sister', 'classic', 'tv', 'show', ""'Bonanza"", 'often', 'referred', 'characters', 'have', 'same', 'father', 'were', 'born', 'different', 'mothers', 'one', 'completely', 'others.The', 'first', 'born', 'brother', 'hot-tempered', 'police', 'officer', 'recently', 'suspended', 'job', 'constantly', 'manhandling', 'perps', 'skels', 'Second', 'line', 'wannabe', 'businessman', 'who', 'more', 'con-man', 'kid', 'brother', 'thief', 'young', 'man', 'very', 'gentle', 'kind', 'soul', 'sister', 'only', 'one', 'bunch', 'film', ""n't"", 'delve', 'character', 'apparent', 'only', 'sibling', 'who', 'typically', 'average', 'life.They', ""'ve"", 'reunited', 'many', 'years', 'separation', 'mostly', 'choice', 'one', 'instance', 'circumstance', 'bury', 'father', 'collect', '12', 'million', 'dollar', 'inheritance', 'older', 'brothers', 'just', 'want', 'receive', 'share', 'money', 'get', 'away', 'other', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'However', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'catch', 'filial', 'sister', 'been', 'named', 'executor', 'estate', 'intention', 'fulfilling', 'father', 'last', 'wish', 'children', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'form', 'successful', 'business', 'One', 'function', 'two', 'years', 'inheritance', 'can', 'be', 'distributed.This', 'forces', 'siblings', 'together', 'like', 'not', 'obviously', 'more', 'latter', 'former', 'Clearly', 'not', 'ideal', 'situation', 'form', 'enterprise', 'much', 'less', 'successful', 'one.Still', 'eldest', 'Cena', 'having', 'recently', 'been', 'suspended', 'again', 'force', 'paycheck', 'weasel', 'brother', 'hock', 'up', 'eyeballs', 'newly', 'discovered', 'baby', 'brother', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'perhaps', 'might', 'be', 'way', 'earn', 'coin', 'official', 'conduct', 'review', 'honestly', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'police', 'career', 'So', 'have', 'work', 'one', 'next', 'couple', 'years', 'decide', 'bounty', 'hunting', 'business', 'can', 'contribute', 'even', 'have', 'job', 'ready', 'hand.Brother', 'number', 'two', 'played', 'funny', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'bail', 'bondsman', 'who', 'laid', 'out', 'last', 'penny', 'getting', 'serious', 'scumbag', 'provisional', 'release', 'surprise', 'convict', 'disappeared', 'runner', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'court', 'appearance', 'out', '50K.But', 'what', 'straight-forward', 'skip', 'trace', 'quickly', 'much', 'bigger', 'problem', 'bail', 'release', 'out', 'bail', 'jumper', 'played', 'key', 'role', 'kidnapping', 'billionaire', 'simple', 'mission', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'problems', 'associated', 'kidnapping', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'brothers', 'get', 'progressively', 'worse.While', ""'Reunion"", ""n't"", 'award', 'contender', 'clearly', 'not', 'intended', 'audience', 'obviously', 'meeting', 'demands', 'action/comedy', 'market', 'speaking', 'one', 'cinephile', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'justify', 'rental', 'fee']",N/A
