742009,A197BQFMF77D24,B00008G8QC,"Agent Excel ""agentexcel""","[0, 1]","The creator of this anime repeatedly stated that he boldly quitted his job twice during his interview in the extra section on the DVD.  Apart from being very amusing, it did impress me greatly.  He boldly quitted this job twice to fulfill his dream to make this anime.  This anime is obviously a labor of love and it showed.Unfortunately, I cannot give it 5 stars.  It was good but not that good.The story is simple.  It seeks to answer the question ""Can love transcend distance and time?""  The answer seemed trite.  So how does focusing on ""I am here"" going to help anything?  The story did touch me greatly, in part due to the excellent voice acting of Cynthia Martinez.  You can feel the two lovers been torn apart by war.  I suppose these days there are no shortage of real life examples.The animation was good but not spectacular.  Of course if you take into consideration that it was basically the work of only one person, you will be tremendously impressed.The voice acting was great.  I wish Cynthia Martinez had more exposure these days.  I just love her girlish little voice.  Wow!The short in the extra section ""She and Her Cat"" was actually better than the main feature.  It was whimsical and sweet.  It showed the infatuation of a cat for his owner.  I loved it.The interview of the director was a gem.  ""So I boldly quit my job!"" he exclaimed.  Not once, but twice!

Third, it was animated with obvious love and conviction by one man. That, to me, was enough to pick this film up.When you sit down to watch it, you'll notice an unconventional style to it. Don't be alarmed by this, as it was indepentantly created by Makoto Shinkai, and it was clear that he was doing this on his own from the start. While watching, your apprehensions should fade as the story starts to seep into you, and eventually, no matter how hard you try, it will all look strange because you'll be looking at the screen through tears. This is as good a love story as there is, and it tells its story in a very unique way, across the stars where time doesn't exactly flow the way it does on Earth. When, as you watch, you realize just what is happening to the main characters, a sense of alarm and loss should come over you. Imagine, getting a text message a year after it was written because of the distance between the two phones. What would you say in the space allowed that was worth travelling for such a long time. This anime poses and answers those question in a wonderful way. I recommend this highly.And, as a bonus, there's a short film about a cat who watches the slow depression of its master and attempts to puzzle out the reasons behind her mood.

742014,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B00008G8QC,A. Schneider,"[1, 1]","With beautiful animation Voices of a Distant Star stands out brilliantly among the short anime films and OVAS. Visually Voices of a Distant Star is downright beautiful, story-wise it's both innocent and romantic.The only disappointment was the fact that it was so short. Though on second thought, ""short and sweet"" truly applies here - if Voices was any longer I feel that it's impact would have been lost.It need not matter that we didn't know the answer as to whether or not the main characters would ever meet again, that wasn't the point of the anime: simply that they loved and maintained their love was the beauty of it. Innocent love, with a tad bit of naivety? You bet, but then again what's so bad about that? The main character seemed to age... sad in comparison with his young love who seemingly remained the same.If traveling through space takes years as does sending a message through space as seen in the anime, then it makes perfect sense that her love for him would remain in tact but for him it would seem like a lifetime has gone by. This is one of the most remarkable aspects about this animated short, it portrays this excellently in a number of ways - cinematically with rain falling on the older young adult's house as he receives a text message from his childhood love... just truly amazing.You never quite know the details behind the war the girl is involved in - I've read a number of negative reviews regarding such details failing to be explained - but isn't that just another prime example of how innocent such a love is? It transcends all situations, all circumstances... remains pure throughout the years.Truly a masterpiece without any obvious flaws!",5,Short and sweet...,1132099200,"11 16, 2005",2005,1681,"['beautiful', 'animation', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'out', 'brilliantly', 'short', 'anime', 'films', 'OVAS', 'Visually', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'downright', 'beautiful', 'story-wise', 'innocent', 'only', 'disappointment', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'short', 'second', 'thought', 'short', 'sweet', 'truly', 'applies', 'here', 'Voices', 'was', 'longer', 'feel', 'impact', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost.It', 'need', 'not', 'matter', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'answer', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'would', 'ever', 'meet', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'point', 'anime', 'simply', 'loved', 'maintained', 'love', 'was', 'beauty', 'Innocent', 'love', 'tad', 'bit', 'naivety', 'bet', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'so', 'bad', 'main', 'character', 'seemed', 'age', 'sad', 'comparison', 'young', 'love', 'who', 'seemingly', 'remained', 'same.If', 'traveling', 'space', 'years', 'sending', 'message', 'through', 'space', 'seen', 'anime', 'then', 'perfect', 'sense', 'love', 'would', 'remain', 'tact', 'would', 'seem', 'lifetime', 'gone', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'aspects', 'animated', 'short', 'excellently', 'number', 'ways', 'cinematically', 'rain', 'falling', 'older', 'young', 'adult', 'house', 'text', 'message', 'childhood', 'love', 'just', 'truly', 'amazing.You', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'details', 'war', 'girl', 'involved', ""'ve"", 'read', 'number', 'negative', 'reviews', 'regarding', 'such', 'details', 'failing', 'be', 'explained', ""n't"", 'that', 'just', 'prime', 'example', 'how', 'innocent', 'such', 'love', 'situations', 'circumstances', 'pure', 'years.Truly', 'masterpiece', 'obvious', 'flaws']",Voices of a Distant Star
742015,A3D2VTO51FRS4Z,B00008G8QC,"""brokenmachine""","[4, 7]","I was very intrigued with this anim&eacute; ever since I first saw some trailers on Newtype DVD's. I grew even more intrigued when I heard that the animation and CG graphics were all done by one man. So, when I heard this had been released, I picked it up and immediately watched it upon my return home.What I saw was a stunning work of moving art. The animation, at face value, is absolutely incredible, and the fact that it was all done by one man makes it even more so. The music isn't remarkable, though it works and suits the mood welle nough. The director is able to weave a grandiose story quite well within a timnefarme of a half hour. I was afraid that, in this anim&eacute;'s short amount of screentime, the characters would not be developed well enough and that the story would feel incomplete or unfinished. Luckily, however, Makoto Shinkai proved me wrong. There are some ludicrous moments in the story, however. I find it hard to believe that either character would continue to subscribe in a long-distance relationship without fail or without looking at the other options around them (particularly, even when the distance between them can be measured in light years. Even though I'm sure there will be great advances in technology within the next few decades, I still find it hard to believe that a cell phone can actually transmit a signal over the course of eight light years. But, I suppose it's safe to say that a good love story isn't created with rationalists in mind. If you can suspend belief in what makes logical sense, or in other words, you're a romantic, you'll enjoy the story.One reviewer compared it with the greatness of Evangelion, though I'm not sure if this is an appropriate comparison. Evangelion and Voices of a Distant Star are both astounding works, but they are also completely different. I would classify this as a moving story with a remarkable emotional punch, one that will be viewed by few people, yet will undoubtedly profoundly affect the few who do watch it. Thus, I would compare it to the greatness of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; or &quot;Now and Then, Here and There.&quot;The short animated film, &quot;She and Her Cat,&quot; which was directed by Makoto Shinkai as well, is unique, mildly perplexing, and an excellent addition.As it is, I would give this remarkable DVD 4 stars.However, the reason why this got a three and not a four is the responsibility of ADV films, the distributor of this film. I'm not one for english voice dubs; I hardly ever choose dubs over subs (Cowboy Bebop being the unique exception), thus I haven't heard the dub. If you're one for dubs, then go ahead and pretend I gave this 4 stars.Before I continue, let me just say that I'm not one of those otaku that gets offended if &quot;what was that&quot; is used in place of &quot;nani&quot; (which is what in Japanese). I don't look for a perfect translation, simply one that conveys the story in general well enough. The tempo of the subtitles here, though, drove me crazy. Some were far too verbose to be read in time, while others were quite terse. As erratic as the timing may be, I was still able to notice numerous misspellings. Considering how I've never had this problem with the 43 other anim&eacute; DVD's that I have, I think it's safe to assume that whoever translated this didn't spend enough time making sure that the timing and the content of the subtitles was as good as the anim&eacute; at hand. Not only that, but the &quot;Original Production Animatic&quot; was left untranslated; there are no subtitles or voice dubs at all!Overall, it's worth the money if you don't mind a disappointing translation or a very short anim&eacute; feature.",3,"Excellent anim&eacute; (4 stars), poor translation (-1 star)",1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,3694,"['was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'anim', 'eacute', 'ever', 'first', 'saw', 'trailers', 'Newtype', 'DVD', 'grew', 'even', 'more', 'intrigued', 'when', 'heard', 'animation', 'CG', 'graphics', 'were', 'done', 'one', 'man', 'So', 'when', 'heard', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'picked', 'up', 'immediately', 'watched', 'return', 'home.What', 'saw', 'was', 'stunning', 'work', 'moving', 'art', 'animation', 'face', 'value', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'fact', 'was', 'done', 'one', 'man', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'music', ""n't"", 'remarkable', 'suits', 'mood', 'welle', 'nough', 'director', 'able', 'weave', 'grandiose', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'timnefarme', 'half', 'hour', 'was', 'afraid', 'anim', 'eacute', 'short', 'amount', 'screentime', 'characters', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'developed', 'well', 'enough', 'story', 'would', 'feel', 'incomplete', 'unfinished', 'Luckily', 'however', 'Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'proved', 'wrong', 'are', 'ludicrous', 'moments', 'story', 'however', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'character', 'would', 'continue', 'subscribe', 'long-distance', 'relationship', 'fail', 'looking', 'other', 'options', 'particularly', 'even', 'when', 'distance', 'can', 'be', 'measured', 'light', 'years', 'Even', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'advances', 'technology', 'next', 'few', 'decades', 'still', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'cell', 'phone', 'can', 'actually', 'transmit', 'signal', 'course', 'eight', 'light', 'years', 'suppose', 'safe', 'say', 'good', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'created', 'rationalists', 'mind', 'can', 'suspend', 'belief', 'what', 'logical', 'sense', 'other', 'words', ""'re"", 'romantic', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'story.One', 'reviewer', 'compared', 'greatness', 'Evangelion', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'appropriate', 'comparison', 'Evangelion', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'are', 'astounding', 'works', 'are', 'also', 'completely', 'different', 'would', 'classify', 'moving', 'story', 'remarkable', 'emotional', 'punch', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'few', 'people', 'yet', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'profoundly', 'affect', 'few', 'who', 'do', 'watch', 'Thus', 'would', 'compare', 'greatness', 'quot', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'quot', 'quot', 'Now', 'Then', 'Here', 'There.', 'quot', 'short', 'animated', 'film', 'quot', 'Her', 'Cat', 'quot', 'was', 'directed', 'Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'as', 'well', 'unique', 'mildly', 'perplexing', 'excellent', 'addition.As', 'would', 'give', 'remarkable', 'DVD', '4', 'stars.However', 'reason', 'why', 'got', 'three', 'not', 'four', 'responsibility', 'ADV', 'films', 'distributor', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'english', 'voice', 'dubs', 'hardly', 'ever', 'choose', 'dubs', 'subs', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'being', 'unique', 'exception', 'thus', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'dub', ""'re"", 'one', 'dubs', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'pretend', 'gave', '4', 'stars.Before', 'continue', 'let', 'just', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'otaku', 'offended', 'quot', 'what', 'was', 'quot', 'used', 'place', 'quot', 'quot', 'what', 'Japanese', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'perfect', 'translation', 'simply', 'one', 'story', 'general', 'well', 'enough', 'tempo', 'subtitles', 'here', 'drove', 'crazy', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'verbose', 'be', 'read', 'time', 'others', 'were', 'quite', 'terse', 'As', 'erratic', 'timing', 'may', 'be', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'notice', 'numerous', 'misspellings', 'Considering', 'how', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'problem', '43', 'other', 'anim', 'eacute', 'DVD', 'have', 'think', 'safe', 'assume', 'whoever', 'translated', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'making', 'sure', 'timing', 'content', 'subtitles', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'anim', 'eacute', 'hand', 'Not', 'only', 'quot', 'Original', 'Production', 'Animatic', 'quot', 'was', 'left', 'untranslated', 'are', 'subtitles', 'voice', 'dubs', 'Overall', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'disappointing', 'translation', 'very', 'short', 'anim', 'eacute', 'feature']",Voices of a Distant Star

""Voices of a Distant Star"" is a short 30 minute animation by Makoto Shinkai that uses both 3D and traditional drawings. And while the graphics are visually stunning with otherworldly effects that will keep you captivated, it's the story that did it for me. Although I do wish this film had been longer to give us viewers more insight on the depth and history of their friendship/relationship, quality rules over quantity here and you can't help but feel the strong connection they have for one another right from the start...Nuboro and Mikako had hopes of attending the same high school together but when a strange alien force threatens the human race, Mikako gives in to her fascinations with the sky above and decides to become a pilot for the UN Forces to help save mankind. But in doing so she was forced to leave behind the one person she cared about more than anything: Nuboro. Their only means of communicating is through text messaging but the further Mikako goes out to space, the longer the messages take to reach him (1 month, 1 year, 8 years...) as he grows older and she remains young.There's of course a sprinkle of battle scenes here and there with sci-fi imagery but ""Voices of a Distant Star"" mostly relies on emotional impacts to keep one entranced and Makoto has done that with misty-eyed perfection. In short, this is a breathtaking anime about one couple's heart-wrenching struggles and how they deal with being apart.

Now I love anime in most of its forms, except gratuituous mecha.  I had hopes for this one as a good, sci-fi topic.  It might have made an impression, had it been a bit longer.  As it was, its hardly worth the money for a 25 minute runtime, when I was expecting a bit more of a movie.I've seen some excellent award winning, short animations, where the animation itself told a great story. I will admit there are a few parts like that in this film.  Unfortunately, there are also time wasting, still shot moments, which should only be part of a longer piece.  In the end, I was left with a lot of questions, and maybe that was the point of it all.  I still hate it when the existential artists make something, and their patrons tell us we should all like it.

I first rented this from a video shop, I watched it rather bemused the first time, but I was interested. I let it rest a day or two and watched it again, following the story easier the second time, also had the subtitles on and they helped ""fill in the gaps"".I came to appreciate it was not a fun or action movie, more of a study in love and relationships, and on a concept that cant yet exist, but in the future could. Love over time and space and the paradoxs this could bring.Its only a half hour movie and that is all it needs as a short story.They a young couple, but space war sees them separated, they communicate via text messages.He Noboru, on earth, time moves normally,She Mikako, a mecha pilot, travels into space, first a few minutes separate their messages. Then she space warps away and comunications take a month, The she again space warps - 8 light years away and of course messages take 8 years to travel one way!.By the time Noboru gets the last message he is 25 years old.. Things have happened in space.. Things have happened on earth, They have one final message to each other transending space and time..An interesting movie.. a movie to move the heart. I did not feel it was depressing as one reviewer put it, more a Romeo & Juliet type compassion and sadness for this couple. Some could shed a tear...The animation and music are fine, but not all that important, its the story that get you, its really a dialog between two people, the sole characters are the couple, and thats it! no one else!Probably not for every one, so try it before you buy it.. but dont be suprised however if you actualy do go and buy it!

I rather liked it, but that's my opinion.Way back when... being on the other end of the world was a world away... often times correspondances took days, weeks, months to reach their destination.  In the modern world, talking with someone on the other side of the world is but about 20 digits on a touchtone phone, a mere double click in an AIM window, an Email Send-button click away.  So being literally a world apart is nothing for todays technology... would that be so if you were trying to have a long distance relationship with someone who lived on, oh say... Pluto?  Well this movie explores that idea of old in a time of hyperspace travel, internet, cellphone email and other wonders... this movie rediscovers that feeling of distance that no longer exists for just about everyone.The first part of the movie introduces the two lovers and gives you a look at to what their life was like on earth.  Watching both, the english and the japanese offers, in a lot of places, a different view of the two (being geared towards the culture that spoke the recorded langugaes).  The rest of the story is basically an exchange of messages between the two of them.  At first the messages take a while, a day or two to reach him.  Then her messages start to take months, as the fleet moves farther away.  The farther it moves, the longer the messages take.  So while her messages are traveling to him, he's living, moving on.  And then he recieves her messages after what seems like forever... messages sent from when she was younger that are just now reaching him.  The small film puts emphasis on her pain and his emptiness and on both of their survivals.The DVD also comes packaged with a short called Her and her Cat.  It's a cute short film about a girl that lives alone with her cat and is all from the Cat's point of view.  I suggest watching the 5 minute version and practising on your speed reading before hand, it's all subtitled and it moves fast.It's a short film, nothing grand and drawn out... no completely breathtaking story.  It's a short that presents a philosophical message, the old time delima of space and distance that is no longer felt as much anymore.  The opening presents the line &quot;[I was always a phone call away]&quot;.  I like it in my anime library because it is short.

742023,AA7W0CFRXF46L,B00008G8QC,elfdart,"[2, 3]","This movie was a lot more abstract than I was expecting. Its very short, only half an hour long, so the story can't be developed in any great length, but the film went ahead with the characters emotionally without giving the audience some kind of back story to help them catch up. Basically, if you want to relate to this movie you'll have to do a lot of the work yourself, which isn't necessarily a negative, but it's not what I was expecting and it wasn't done well enough to make me forget that that wasn't what I was expecting.The story follows two high school aged sweethearts, Mikako and Noboru, who were separated at the beginning of high school because Mikako accepts a mission to fly a mecha man across the solar system to fight aliens on a distant planet (which is interesteing to consider in a gender role sense because most of the time is it the guy who goes away to war or to explore and the girl stays home to wait). As she flies further and further away she tries to text Noboru and the more she travels the more years it will take to reach him. She finally reaches a faraway planet that is 8 light years away from earth and she sends a text, by the time he gets the text he's moved on with his life but they both say that they regret not having lived with each other.I found that I couldn't really connect with the characters very well, Mikako was curled up in a ball crying all the time, even when she was fighting aliens. Noboru was distant and cool and when the time came, gave up on the supposed love of his life way too easily for the audience to believe that he cared at all in the first place. There are very few flashbacks, but the ones provided show them talking casually as friends or hanging out and were not really emotionally charged enough to set up Mikako's constant tears (which is why I said that you would have to do a lot of the emotional leg work by yourself, in your own head, because its not in the film).Aside from the plot though, the art was beautiful. The drawing of the characters were not to my taste, but the scenery was stunning. Really beautiful artwork. I believe this was done almost wholly by one artist, which is amazing.",3,alright,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,2172,"['movie', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'abstract', 'was', 'expecting', 'very', 'short', 'only', 'hour', 'long', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'developed', 'great', 'length', 'film', 'went', 'ahead', 'characters', 'emotionally', 'giving', 'audience', 'kind', 'back', 'story', 'help', 'catch', 'up', 'Basically', 'want', 'relate', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'lot', 'work', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'negative', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expecting.The', 'story', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'aged', 'sweethearts', 'Mikako', 'Noboru', 'who', 'were', 'separated', 'beginning', 'high', 'school', 'Mikako', 'mission', 'fly', 'mecha', 'man', 'solar', 'system', 'fight', 'aliens', 'distant', 'planet', 'interesteing', 'consider', 'gender', 'role', 'sense', 'most', 'time', 'guy', 'who', 'away', 'war', 'explore', 'girl', 'home', 'wait', 'further', 'further', 'away', 'text', 'Noboru', 'more', 'more', 'years', 'will', 'take', 'reach', 'finally', 'faraway', 'planet', '8', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'earth', 'text', 'time', 'text', 'moved', 'life', 'say', 'regret', 'not', 'having', 'lived', 'other.I', 'found', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'connect', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'Mikako', 'was', 'curled', 'up', 'ball', 'crying', 'time', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'fighting', 'aliens', 'Noboru', 'was', 'distant', 'cool', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'gave', 'up', 'supposed', 'love', 'life', 'way', 'too', 'easily', 'audience', 'believe', 'cared', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'ones', 'provided', 'show', 'talking', 'casually', 'friends', 'hanging', 'out', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'enough', 'set', 'up', 'Mikako', 'constant', 'tears', 'why', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'lot', 'emotional', 'leg', 'work', 'own', 'head', 'not', 'film', '.Aside', 'plot', 'art', 'was', 'beautiful', 'drawing', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'taste', 'scenery', 'was', 'stunning', 'Really', 'beautiful', 'artwork', 'believe', 'was', 'done', 'almost', 'wholly', 'one', 'artist', 'amazing']",Voices of a Distant Star

It is not. It's a start for an upcoming director, but still not up to Miyazaki's greatness. This is not Miyazaki, so don't expect a Miyazaki type film.The film itself is great. A young female joins the UN army to help fight off an alien race that has attacked a colony on mars, leaving behind her childhood friend and love. As her fleet moves farther and farther away from earth the time it takes for her messages to get to him take longer and lounger. First its six months, then a year, and then eight. Can their friendship and love survive as he gets older but she remains 15? Will she survive? Will they see each other again?This isn't so much of a movie than one long dialoged with both characters reminiscing on how they miss each other and how they miss each other. They are they only two characters in this whole movie, a movie that is only 23 minutes long, and their dialogue is mostly them thinking to themselves. This isn't much of a problem however because the movie is so short and doesn't need secondary characters to help the flow of the story.THE GOOD: first of all the artwork is really, REALLY good. For a guy that made this movie on his Mac, by himself, in his basement, this looks amazing. Whatever you have to say about this anime, good or bad, you have to admit that the animation is top notch. Another great part of the story is the fact that the characters are so well done. Even my none anime sister felt very sorry for the main characters in this film. They might not be as good as some characters in other amines I've seen, but I blame that on the fact that this movie is only 23 minutes long. Also the music is great. I love the music for Miyazaki's movies and I have to say that this music is almost as good.THE BAD: well let's start with the obvious. It's too short. 23 minutes is not nearly enough time to make a great movie. If only it were lounger this could have been a truly great film, as is it's just a really good short. That's really the only complaint I have, everything else is top notch.One bit of advice though. watch this movie in English and then watch the original Japanese version with subtitles. The reason for this is that the subtitles go so fast that it's hard to read them and watch the screen at the same time. if you watch it in English than you will know what the story is and then read the differences in the Japanese version. I think its better in Japanese, the dialog is more real and the text messages make the two characters seem more like long time friends, but i had a devil of a time keeping up and kept missing parts.Overall this is a very good film that deserves to be watched but not up to Miyazaki's greatness.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[1, 3]","First if you read most of the other reviews you notice that all of them including mine agree on some things. First the story and animation are very beautiful but where's the rest of it. I have no problem with short anime movies I've seen a bunch but everyone knows some are meant to be short and some are not. This movie to me was not thought out well the story line is so good it needs more to it. Imagine how shocked I was to hear nobody wondering if they were ever going to meet again.The entire 25 minutes which in their movie time it would be 10 years Mikako one of the main characters pilots her fighter ship in a war your not told much about. She never gets out of the ship, she doesn't eat and if she sleeps it's in the ship. So that's 10 years of nothing just wanting to come home, wanting to taste food again and text messaging your love one and the bad thing is that because she's in space a message takes from 1 to 8 years to get to someone.Her being in a space army was a great opportunity to show how she makes new friends in the  army but the army is just a bunch of other ships with people in them like her. There is a big home ship but who knows what the heck is in there but they don't tell you about that. I'm one f those people where I can understand deep movies but maybe voices of a distant star is just too deep and I can't see the beauty shinkai is trying to show.Maybe he did think of all the things viewers like me and my friends are wanting to know more about but he wanted to put out something different and unique. It seems like someone got lazy and turned something that could of been a masterpiece into an episode of a series.

742032,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B00008G8QC,Lesley Aeschliman,"[2, 4]","Voices of a Distant Star is an anime Original Video Animation (OVA) directed and produced by Makoto Shinkai on his Macintosh computer.  The film tells a love story between Mikako (a middle-school girl drafted into the UN Space Army) and Noboru.  They try to stay in communication by utilizing the e-mail capabilities on their cell phones.  As the ship Mikako is on travels deeper and deeper into space, the time it takes for a message to reach Noboru on Earth takes longer.  Mikako's final message takes eight years to reach Noboru.Voices of a Distant Star uses the theory of relativity to tell an interesting story.  However, the production only runs for twenty-five minutes, and it feels like the story isn't finished.  As a viewer, I really wanted to know what happens to both Mikako and Noboru.  The animation is lush, and the music is beautiful, but it feels like Shinkai ended the story too soon.  However, when you watch this film, you can see the filmmaking style that Shinkai used when he produced The Place Promised in Our Early Days.The DVD release of Voices of a Distant Star includes some extras.  The first is three versions of She and Her Cat, one of the first shorts Makoto Shinkai produced.  There is a ""Digest Version"" that runs for one-and-a-half minutes, a three-minute version, and a five-minute version.  It's a black and white piece that tells the story of a cat and a young woman who owns him.  There is an interview with Makoto Shinkai, a ""Director's Cut"" of Voices of a Distant Star, the Original Production Animatic, the original Japanese trailers for Voices of a Distant Star, and ADV Previews.While Voices of a Distant Star was an interesting story, I'm not sure I could recommend purchasing this DVD for full price.  Between the short runtime for the actual production, and that most of the extras are alternate versions of the production, I'm not convinced it's worth the cost.  However, if you can track down a used copy of the DVD for a cheaper purchase price, then it might be worth the money to pick it up.",3,This is Makoto Shinkai's first major work after She and Her Cat,1226361600,"11 11, 2008",2008,2041,"['Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'anime', 'Original', 'Video', 'Animation', 'OVA', 'directed', 'produced', 'Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'Macintosh', 'computer', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'Mikako', 'middle-school', 'girl', 'drafted', 'UN', 'Space', 'Army', 'Noboru', 'try', 'stay', 'communication', 'utilizing', 'e-mail', 'capabilities', 'cell', 'phones', 'ship', 'Mikako', 'travels', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'space', 'time', 'message', 'reach', 'Noboru', 'Earth', 'longer', 'Mikako', 'final', 'message', 'eight', 'years', 'reach', 'Noboru.Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'theory', 'relativity', 'tell', 'interesting', 'story', 'However', 'production', 'only', 'twenty-five', 'minutes', 'story', ""n't"", 'finished', 'viewer', 'really', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'Mikako', 'Noboru', 'animation', 'lush', 'music', 'beautiful', 'Shinkai', 'ended', 'story', 'too', 'soon', 'However', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'Shinkai', 'used', 'when', 'produced', 'Place', 'Promised', 'Early', 'Days.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'extras', 'first', 'three', 'versions', 'Her', 'Cat', 'one', 'first', 'shorts', 'Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'produced', 'Digest', 'Version', 'one-and-a-half', 'minutes', 'three-minute', 'version', 'five-minute', 'version', 'black', 'white', 'piece', 'story', 'cat', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'interview', 'Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'Original', 'Production', 'Animatic', 'original', 'Japanese', 'trailers', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'ADV', 'Previews.While', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'was', 'interesting', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'full', 'price', 'short', 'runtime', 'actual', 'production', 'most', 'extras', 'are', 'alternate', 'versions', 'production', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'cost', 'However', 'can', 'track', 'down', 'used', 'copy', 'DVD', 'cheaper', 'purchase', 'price', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'money', 'pick', 'up']",Voices of a Distant Star
742033,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00008G8QC,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[6, 9]","In many ways, Voices of a Distant Star by Makoto Shinkai is a labor of love. He did almost all of the work himself, and the voices are done by he and his wife. This explains the only 30 minute run time.The story, set in the future, is of Mikako and Noboru. The two are friends in junior high, but only a few years later Mikako is sent off into the military to pilot a mech warrior. Not only that, but she is immediately sent on a super dangerous mission to the far reaches of our galaxy to face the space aliens at their home planet. By the time she gets here, even though it takes a relatively short period of time ""real life"", her cell phone messages back to Noboru now take 8 years to send.You really have to completely suspend realistic disbelief if you're going to watch and enjoy this movie as a ""romantic tender"" story. There are many issues that kept bugging me. First, this is an incredibly important military mission. They're using 15 year old girls as their front line troops?? Surely, no matter how brilliant this girl is, they're not going to put her in as cannon fodder. It makes no sense at all. Second, they obviously can warp the spaceships to reach their destination in a short period of time. They're not going to have any ability to warp communications back and forth? They're telling their troops to ""write home"" in one scene, but they're sending those messages in a long tedious way that takes 8 years one way? How can they possibly wage a war with that kind of communication? Why would they, when they are zipping entire batallions of troops back and forth with super-fast ease?But let's agree to ignore all of those issues. The movie isn't about those. In fact even though there are mech robots involved, there are only a few combat scenes. Really, the movie is about time and evolving personalities. You see the gorgeous drifting of white clouds, the tender falling of rain, the wispy snows. Noboru is left on Earth and drifts through these various changes in nature, wondering how Mikako is doing. In the meantime, although Mikako gets to do some sight-seeing as she goes through our own solar system, as soon as she's out ""in the far reaches of space"" all you see of her is her sterile robot and her cell phone. In fact in one scene it really looks like she is abandoned by her fleeing troops because she hesitates in order to grab her cell phone back from where it'd fallen.As gorgeous and different as the two environments are, though, I really had trouble believing in this connection between the two. They were just friends when they parted. They weren't in love, they weren't clinging to each other declaring their love. In fact we don't even see the parting - just that ""Oh she's gone"". She could easily write him daily, but she chooses to write him VERY infrequently. He gives her the same shallow indifference.Some people seem VERY confused about the very simple time issue. He is on Earth. She is far away. Her message takes 8 years to get back to him. She sends a message when she is 15. She knows that therefore he'll only get to listen to it when he is 15+8=24 (apparently adjusting for their different birthdays). SHE IS GOING TO BE 24 TOO WHEN THAT TIME COMES!!! If he had sent HER a message on that exact same day that she sent him her message, she would get his message when she was 24. He would get her message when he was 24. They would both get messages that had been written when the pair were 15. It's not like she is ""stuck at 15"" or he is ""aging without her"".The movie ends with her on the distant planet, feeling lonely and having an injured robot. He is independently about to join the Space Marines :). So who knows, maybe both will die sadly in war without ever finding each other. Maybe they'll serve together. Maybe the war will end and they'll meet up in peace. But since these guys were never even dating, never mind discussing long term relationships, it seems a bit forced.I definitely appreciate the movie a lot! This is an incredible amount of work to have been done by one person. The characters have a lot of emotion in them. The ""worlds"" they live in are shown to be very different but to have similarities. I just find a lot of the poignancy to be plotted out. I find that a lot of bizarre issues are glossed over, that could easily have been explained. They could have made the relationship far more believable. It just needed a few more tweaks to become an amazing classic.Now, a note about the DVD. The subtitles are AWFUL. There are long sequences where the characters are having in depth conversations and there are NO subtitles at all. In fact, there is a critical scene where Mikako is on the enemy planet and apparently runs into an enemy unit. They talk to each other - but you have no idea what they are saying! The subtitles are completely missing. Are they both saying they're tired of fighting? Are they saying ""let's get it over with""? Is it even an enemy unit? Apparently we'll never know. They could have done a MUCH much better job subtitling this DVD.",4,Gorgeous Animation - A Few Plot Issues,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,5035,"['many', 'ways', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'Makoto',

742035,ADTUS88NFTW23,B00008G8QC,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[7, 7]","I picked up this short film (~25 minutes) at an anime convention.  The art is simply beautiful.  About 5 minutes into watching it, I was really annoyed with the subtitles moving too fast and taking up a third of the screen; so I switched to the English dub.  To my surprise, the English language track was well done.  It was nicely acted and the voices matched the characters properly.  This is mostly an art film.  A short story about lovers separated by space and time.  It reminded me a bit of Orson Scott Card's ""Speaker for the Dead"" (or Einstein's theory of space travel if you want to split hairs).  The girl travels far out in space aging days, while her love back home ages years.  The further out she travels, the longer her messages take to get back home.

The story is very original yet so simple, you sort of wonder how come no one thought of it before.By now you probably already know the plot, so I won't go into details about it.I will admit that the romance and chemistry between the two lovers is brilliantly communicated thru their actions and overwhelms the movie. Yes, there is amazingly shot and animated fight scenes and the animation of the spaceship is ethereal and well done and is also the BEST of what I've seen in this genre of Anime.The storyline, as usual with most anime, involves kids who never seem to age in personality and physically, but in ""Voices..."" the characters age and the storyline is very mature and the dilemna of love lost is realistically written.This is where this anime rises above the others and even movies. It's beauty lies in the fact that this is a very believable story that pulls you in and makes you feel what the characters are going thru. Then 27 minutes or so later this brillant movie ends abruptly...too abruptly!My only wish is that it would have been at least 30 minutes longer. I did understand that the man who made this anime did everything by himself on one MAC computer and even used his wife to voice the girl character and he himself dubbed the boyfriend's voice.

Both are good but it really depends on which one you watched first.I watched 5cm first and because of that, I can almost recognize this movie, Voices, as being the ""warm up"" of the general idea. The big contrast that one could offer is that whereas in 5cm is grounded in every day life, Voices uses the idea of space travel as another obstacle for two people being together. However, the element of time dilation was not fully appreciated (or exploited) in Voices.In the Sci-fi series Gun Buster, the concept of space travel and time dilation is better integrated into the story. In Gun Buster one can see and feel the sense of abandonment/distancing that the main character experiences as she ages (much) slower than her friends/peers. With each mission, we see the main character being left behind as her friends and peers simply live and move along. At one point the difference between timelines is so large, that for contemporaries it makes no difference with death, friends will never see each other again, even if they continue to live.Overall I did like the Voices, but also think that I was lucky to have seen 5cm first and so enjoyed the benefit of not knowing Shinkai's themes of separated love.

742049,AJ6XR403WY88M,B00008G8QC,"Sniff Code ""www.sniffcode.com""","[2, 2]","As usual, not only am I late for the party, but when I do arrive I walk in a** backwards. Such is the case of my personal discovery of director Makoto Shinkai. The first movie of his that I saw was 5 Centimeter per Second, which despite its sincerity was much too sappy for my taste. Yet, Shinkai's artwork was compelling enough to take a stab at Voice of a Distant Star, which came highly recommended by a friend -- four years ago. I'm not kidding. It was that long ago, and I finally got around to seeing it.Never has the expression ""better late then never"" been so appropriate. No matter how long you wait, you really shouldn't let this one slip past you. In fact, see it before you see 5 Centimeters, which was produced after Distant Star. Now that I've seen the latter, I better appreciate many of the visual elements of the former. Distant Star hasn't changed my opinion about 5 Centimeters, but it does soften it.The story of Distant Star is remarkably simple and brilliantly original. A teenage girl, Mikako Nagamine, goes into deep space with the United Nations army. She leaves behind her boyfriend, Noboru Terao. For reasons that probably has something to do with the Space-Time in Einstein's General Relativity and the Black Holes of Stephen Hawkings, Mikako doesn't age as she travels into ever more distant galaxies. She attempts to stay in touch with Noboru by sending emails through her cell phone. But the further she travels, the longer it takes for the messages to reach him -- eventually as long as 8 years.Unlike Mikako, Noboru ages while he suffers the long lapses between messages from his lost love. First months go by between messages. Next years. Eventually, he must move on.Unlike 5 Centimeters, where the narrative is overloaded with exposition, with Distant Star the poignancy of the characters is never explained away. It's left exactly where it is supposed to be -- in the painful body language of the characters. Occasionally, the emails sent to Noboru are read to us by Mikako's voice, but here it is well done. The messages do not come off as bad poetry, but instead the true anxiety of a young girl who knows that she may never see her boyfriend again. The ending of Distant Star is by far one of the most memorable I have ever seen -- and possibly even the best, or at least, among the best.5 Centimeters relives this theme of early separation, and many of the visual motifs that were used in Distant Star are revisited in 5 Centimeters. I can now see that Makoto Shinkai has very early on discovered for himself both a directing style and tonality that warrants him being called a master. More astonishing than anything else is that Distant Star was done entirely by Shinkai on his desktop computer. If the budget technology shows in the first few minutes, it disappears soon after as you are lost in a compelling story and graphical execution that still holds up to our standards 5 years later. The scene of Mikako on a planet in the Sirius star system rivals the lush work of Miyazaki. Believe me, that's saying something.At only 30 minutes, there are few reasons to not see this anime short.

Tonight, as I was watching the extremely special tv show, &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; again recommended by a great friend, as close as a brother,  o8E  Someone told Joan: &quot;Real connections--they can't be broken by time or space.&quot; And I thought of this movie.  And that is what &quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot; is all about to me. Believing in love and connections throughout time and space is as essential as belief in myself, that I can achieve whatever I put my heart to, and in all things Good.  o8E  I'm feeling thankful for the precious friends that love me, and I'm most thankful for WindBeneathHer (MY) Wings tonight because soaring isn't possible without the Wind and he is that for me o8E.

742051,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B00008G8QC,Spider Monkey,"[1, 1]","`Voices of A Distant Star' is a short animation produced entirely on the directors home computer. For this reason alone the animation and artwork seems especially rich and impressive. Light music flows almost constantly underneath the story and the English dubbing is pretty good. The story follows a female pilot who goes into space and who communicates via text messages which take longer and longer to reach her boyfriend as she goes deeper into space. Essentially it is a love story with a futuristic setting. It is very short, but well thought out and executed and is good if you fancy some anime but don't want a full length feature. The extras are pretty good as well. Worth a look if you're a fan of japanimation.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",4,Voices of a Distant Star,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,790,"['Voices', 'A', 'Distant', 'Star', 'short', 'animation', 'produced', 'entirely', 'directors', 'home', 'computer', 'reason', 'alone', 'animation', 'artwork', 'especially', 'rich', 'impressive', 'Light', 'music', 'almost', 'constantly', 'story', 'English', 'dubbing', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'female', 'pilot', 'who', 'space', 'who', 'text', 'messages', 'take', 'longer', 'longer', 'reach', 'boyfriend', 'deeper', 'space', 'Essentially', 'love', 'story', 'futuristic', 'setting', 'very', 'short', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'executed', 'good', 'fancy', 'anime', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'look', ""'re"", 'fan', 'japanimation.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",Voices of a Distant Star
742052,AUTBHG6070SL4,B00008G8QC,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[2, 4]","This anime leaves two very different impressions. One is a clear but complex mix of feelings, as two young lovers, chaste and romantic, are separated by war. She goes off to combat among the star. He never forgets her, but the war carries her light-minutes away, then light-months, then light-years. She sends him her love as often as she can, perhaps every few days of her life, and he looks every day for her messages. Over time, though, he receives them less and less often. The intervals grow from days, to months, to years as her warship carries her farther and farther. Other rifts deepen, too, as the light-decade between them brings him into his twenties, but leaves her as the teenager he last saw. The only strands connecting them are the lines of text she is sometimes able to send. Military rules and pragmatics mean that he can only receive her messages - he is mute. The  sorrow of the situation mostly speaks for itself; whatever the divided lovers feel, they leave largely unsaid. It's a short movie, about 25 minutes. That is all that's needed, though. More directors should exercise such restraint.The second impression of this movie almost turned me off to it completely. The visual style, though competent in its way, uses way too many of the anime cliches. She always appears in her shortie schoolgirl skirt and playfully dishevelled necktie, even in combat. Everyone features big eyes, tiny mouths, and stick-thin legs. And yes, there are flying robots with the stock assortment of lasers, missiles, and forcefields. If the visual styling could have escaped the ordinary, this could have been new landmark in the world of anime. Ordinary isn't bad, though, so the story carries this movie beautifully.Extras include the pencil sketches used to rough out the visual story, a director's cut of the movie, and a brief feature lacking English sound or text - interesting, but largely closed to me. The package as a whole, though, is well worthwhile.//wiredweird",4,Elegant and understated,1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,1979,"['anime', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'impressions', 'One', 'clear', 'complex', 'mix', 'feelings', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'chaste', 'romantic', 'are', 'separated', 'war', 'off', 'combat', 'star', 'never', 'war', 'light-minutes', 'away', 'then', 'light-months', 'then', 'light-years', 'love', 'as', 'often', 'can', 'perhaps', 'few', 'days', 'life', 'day', 'messages', 'time', 'though', 'less', 'less', 'often', 'intervals', 'grow', 'days', 'months', 'years', 'warship', 'farther', 'farther', 'Other', 'rifts', 'deepen', 'too', 'light-decade', 'twenties', 'teenager', 'last', 'saw', 'only', 'connecting', 'are', 'lines', 'text', 'sometimes', 'able', 'send', 'Military', 'rules', 'pragmatics', 'mean', 'can', 'only', 'receive', 'messages', 'mute', 'sorrow', 'situation', 'mostly', 'whatever', 'divided', 'lovers', 'feel', 'leave', 'largely', 'unsaid', 'short', 'movie', 'about', '25', 'minutes', 'needed', 'though', 'More', 'directors', 'should', 'exercise', 'such', 'restraint.The', 'second', 'impression', 'movie', 'almost', 'turned', 'completely', 'visual', 'style', 'competent', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'anime', 'cliches', 'always', 'shortie', 'schoolgirl', 'skirt', 'playfully', 'dishevelled', 'necktie', 'even', 'combat', 'Everyone', 'big', 'eyes', 'tiny', 'mouths', 'stick-thin', 'legs', 'yes', 'are', 'flying', 'robots', 'stock', 'assortment', 'lasers', 'missiles', 'forcefields', 'visual', 'styling', 'could', 'have', 'escaped', 'ordinary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'new', 'landmark', 'world', 'anime', 'Ordinary', ""n't"", 'bad', 'though', 'story', 'movie', 'include', 'pencil', 'sketches', 'used', 'rough', 'out', 'visual', 'story', 'director', 'cut', 'movie', 'brief', 'feature', 'lacking', 'English', 'sound', 'text', 'interesting', 'largely', 'closed', 'package', 'whole', 'well', 'worthwhile.//wiredweird']",Voices of a Distant Star
