I read all of the wonderful reviews and rented this movie and I want to save everyone time and money and tell them to SKIP this movie and save their money.  The plot is horrible (not sure if there even IS one) and the end is not fulfilling nor does it make any sense.  Every once in a while I feel the pressing need to add my opinion and this time is one of them.  Rebecca De Mornay should have waited for a much better vehicle to try to make her entrance back into film.  Oh, and one more thing?  She looks just like Hillary Clinton and that creates an odd impression also of our secretary of state slashing and killing all the way through a movie.  (Maybe that is an omen about the next presidential election?) Last thing?  Brett Ratner, if this is the best you could do then no wonder you were fired from presenting the Oscars sorry to say.

1444776,A3FOM98U5UBAX7,B0057JIR0Y,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Rebecca DeMorney steals this show. Some reviewers here and elsewhere are expecting too much of this movie. If you want ""high brow"" sensibilities and cinematic perfection, look elsewhere. This is an A+ B-Movie, however, so to speak. The violence was creative, and pretty disturbing. I watched about 15 minuutes of SAW 1 and had to turn it off because it was too intense and gross for me. (This flick is lovingly offered by the Director of a few of the SAW movies, so  expect some scary stuff. The only two likable characters here are the criminal family's mind-controlled daughter, who, with the help of the hostage-doctor, begins to see that her life was a lie created by ""Mother"". As for the rest of the cast, the hostages are pretty venial, refusing to cooperate to defeat the decidedly dysfuntional demonic family. I had no interest in the fate of them, ,save for the aforementioned doctor, who revels all the secrets which need to be revealed. Who lives and who dies is pretty irrelevant here; the fight scenes are great and crappy, even if one hopes both combatants lose. There is avery strong anti-yuppie thread through the proceedings, so if you swill Starbucks coffee and really care about how your coworkers will be intimidated by your overpriced wannabe luxury car, be prepared to be insulted. The main fun here is hating ""Mother"" and witnessing her descent into a June Cleaver-but-this-time-she's-insane meltdown. Deborah Ann Woll does a great job as Lydia, a modern day Squeaky Fromm who I still  found myself rooting for. She wants out of the family business, but doesn't know how far she's will to go to break free. So sit back, get yourself a caffeinated beverage, and join your special  someone and watch this often darkly amusing production. Veterans of the ultra-splatter genre may find this movie a tad tame, but for me, it had just enough nasty in it to make it more than worth the rental price.

1444779,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0057JIR0Y,B. E Jackson,"[0, 2]","Money is the root of all evil, and this movie totally proves it.While I've never seen the original, you know quite frankly it doesn't even *matter*.  Mother's Day is an EXTREMELY violent, mentally disturbing, emotional roller coaster ride of excitement, confusion, suspense, and just about everything else you can throw on the table.  It's about a group of violent brothers (and their mother) that return to their old home in an attempt to obtain lots of money that's been mailed to that address.  However, when they arrive they quickly realize that new owners have moved in.  Considering how violent these brothers are, you can probably guess what happens- they threaten the new owners -as well as the new owners many friends who happen to drop by for a party they'll never forget- to hand over the money that the brothers and mother strongly believe they're hiding somewhere in the house.  After all, the money was shipped to that address.  *Someone* has to have it!  You'll find out through the many twists and turns what makes money such a vicious thing.Let's mention the storyline since it's probably one of the most brutal and graphic I've ever seen.  It's comparable to the Hills Have Eyes.  Remember that segment in the Hills Have Eyes when a mother gets shot in graphic fashion with all the trademark screaming and blood squirting?  Expect several moments in Mother's Day that are as equally disturbing, trust me.  However, Mother's Day takes it a step further.  Guess what THESE bad guys do?  They threaten their victims by playing games with them.  What happens when one man doesn't listen?  Why, he has scolding hot water poured into his ears as he screams and loses his hearing.  It's only fair since he didn't do what he was told, right?  He didn't do what mother wanted!  Follow the rules and everything will go accordingly.What happens when a woman begs for her life but is unable to defend herself because she's tied up?  She has her head set on fire with the burn marks plainly, painfully and disturbingly visible to us.  She can't even comfort her head because her arms are tied.  Meanwhile her friends who are tied up RIGHT NEXT to her have to see this happen and worry that the fire might carry over onto them.  This is what mother wanted.  How about a gunshot directly to the back of the head when a girl tries to run away from one of the crazy gun-shooting brothers so half of her head is blown apart before our very eyes?  The timing of THIS one shocked me pretty good.  In fact the timing overall is pretty spectacular and unpredictable, really adding to the suspense factor.  I could go on and on naming several other horrific moments that involve torture but this is good enough.  A certain sexual-related scene is pretty warped too- I'm not really referring to the act itself but what the bad guys do to determine which woman has to go through with the sex.  It's really crazy.This kind of stuff shows just how vicious and animal-like people can be and will certainly make you question God's existence.  The storyline proves that it's too easy to turn into a total monster whenever you become angry and crazy enough and nothing can stop it from happening.The mother however (played by Rebecca De Mornay) CLEARLY stands out as the best character.  Pretending to be nice and innocent and protective of her boys only to have a demented side that firmly believes those that refuse to follow the rules have to suffer the consequences makes Mother's Day such a thrilling experience.  She defends her sons constantly but does so in an abnormal way.Time and time again I do feel that the brothers were probably too polite towards the blonde-haired woman, who the one brother drives to the bank to withdraw enough cash.  This is to allow the brothers and their mother to be on their way with enough money in their possession.  This leads to the best segment in the film- when the one brother forces two girls to decide who's going to kill the other so one of them can live, and if they don't make a decision in 30 seconds he'll shoot both of them anyway leading to several ""PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!"" screams and tears by the girls.  Yes it's *this* kind of movie!Mother's Day is completely 100% SICK.  If you're easily offended by how twisted and cruel people can be when they have nothing to lose, this movie is NOT for you.  For the horror and suspense fans that enjoy a neverending thrilling ride, this *is* for you.  Just remember, money is the root of all evil and you'll see that this old expression has more meaning than simply the demented mother and her sons trying to obtain all the money that they feel is theirs.  The storyline goes even deeper despite simply featuring one violent act after another, which is a remarkable feat really.

It was a grimy, slimy movie about abduction, torture, and rape via inbred hillbilly-types. The MOTHER was an old hag w/ an extremely twisted sense of family. The remake is quite different. It's a home-invasion story, w/ a family of bank robbers on the run. This time, the MOTHER role is played by the incredible Rebecca De Mornay (THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, IDENTITY). She is the blackened heart and sickened soul of this film. Ms. De Mornay is riveting, as she seethes w/ pent-up rage and eeevil, while still managing to give off a deceiving sense of restraint. Her performance appears effortless and genuine. My one thought while watching was: ""Why doesn't she do more horror movies?"" As for her family, well, they're a homicidal mess. The offspring in this update are more deeply-damaged psychopaths than knuckle-dragging hicks. The victims of the story are unsuspecting, upper middle class folks. They're just having fun at a party when the terror begins. Jaime King (THEY WAIT, THE TRIPPER) plays one of the besieged homeowners, suddenly plunged into survival mode. The overall atmosphere of the movie reminded me of the remakes of LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, both of which I liked more than the originals.

Unfortunately for the new owners and their party guests, that means that they have just become hostages to a crazed family and their keen but equally insane mother! Rebecca De Mornay stars in Darren Lynn Bousman's sleek restyling of the cult classic MOTHER'S DAY, which takes us back to the early days of Exploitation with its raw violence and ruthless characters. What begins as a generic thriller quickly escalates into an all-out nightmare that explodes with many unexpected moments of bloody carnage. Bousman keeps with the dark satire of the original in portraying the average American family turned upside down, whose corrupted sense of morality leads to death and destruction.

1444783,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,B0057JIR0Y,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[3, 9]","I encourage everybody to check this flick out, as all my horror buds seem to love it.  I for one had to call the horror plumber, as it severely clogged up my mental pipes.  Seriously I had to flush this gigantic piece of poop far, far away.  The Mother's Day stench still permeates my room like a baby squatting in month old diapers.Now let me say I love silly low budget horror flicks.  Pretty much anything from Troma or the like I totally dig, or at least can appreciate the efforts of the independent filmmaker.  This one does have great production values plus a talented cast.  Not to mention Rebecca DeMornay seems to be aging like Benjamin Buttons--looking better than ever.  I'm curious why she agreed to this flick though, I guess casting calls have sadly been few and far between.Anyway, this is a home invasion flick.  Super scary premise.  It's the kind of serious subject matter that perhaps requires a certain director to pull off.  As I watched this movie start to unfold, I began to get the same feeling I got when watching Die Hard 4.  Not because of some over the top action scenes, but because of developments that defy all logic.  I can handle a few miscues plus I can leap over some plot holes, but c'mon!  Groan after groan after head shaking followed by unintentional laughter...this became an unbearable chore for me to sit through.  Nonsensical dialogue and character reactions coupled with straight up preposterous unbelievable situations...ARGGHH!  I was crying for my mommy.Mother's Day does have a nice pace to go with the solid acting and good production values.  There are a couple halfway decent violent moments but nothing too graphic.  This movie appeals to many viewers, but I'm definitely not one of them.

1444784,A2LWUNJVOGYUIM,B0057JIR0Y,Chad Radford,"[10, 14]","The original ""Mother's Day"" film was directed by Charles Kaufman, brother of Troma's Lloyd Kaufman, and released in the early 1980's in the middle of the slasher movie craze.  It was wild, intense, gory, and included some very silly humor.  I saw it on cable tv in 1983 on the night before Mother's Day and it scared the heck out of me when Queenie made her appearance at the end of the film.  The 2010 version of ""Mother's Day"" is a reimagining of the orignal film.  In a nod to the original film, there are a few references to Queenie.  However, that is where the similarities end.  Rebecca de Mornay plays the mother character in this movie and she owns every scene she is in through out the entire film.  She is by turns motherly and caring and sadistic and brutal.  She rules her family with an iron grip.  You can read the synopsis of the film on the Amazon web site so I won't go into details.  I will say this movie is very brutal, graphic, and intense.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.  In a review of the film, Rue Morgue Magazine said that the movie was so good it should have been released in the theaters instead of dumped on DVD without a theatrical screening.  I wholeheartedly agree.  This movie deserves much better.",5,Surprise!

1444785,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0057JIR0Y,C. Sawin,"[1, 3]","When it comes to the work of director Darren Lynn Bousman, I'm pretty torn. He almost always does a movie with this really fantastic concept, but its execution is never really as sweet as the bite it promises. I loved the concept of Repo! The Genetic Opera, but felt like nothing really meshed together properly. They had the talent, but it was as if Lionsgate just threw everyone into a room and hoped for the best. Meanwhile the Saw sequels Bousman did are perhaps what he's best known for. Saw III is probably his best effort, but is still a bit lackluster in comparison to the original Saw (a personal favorite). His remake of Mother's Day has actually been in the can since December of 2009, but is just now getting an official release. It might be Bousman's best film to date, but its content may put some people off.Mother's Day doesn't really do anything wrong. The cast is incredibly strong and everyone goes above and beyond what is needed for them. Mother (played by Rebecca De Mornay) is the person people will be talking about the most. Her methods of raising children are pretty disturbing and even though she's pretty twisted herself, she still has that mother-like quality to her that only makes every situation a bit creepier. The fight she has with Beth (Jaime King) is spectacular. Who knew a fight between two women could be so brutal? Ike (Patrick Flueger) is the most determined of Mother's children while Addley (Warren Kole) flies off the handle at every turn. Addley's tendency to jump the gun is key to some of the film's most gory and memorable scenes. Shawn Ashmore's performance as George is really noteworthy though. He did a really great job in Frozen a few years back, but he plays a doctor this time around and he seems to show the most courage of the men being held hostage next to Treshawn (Lyriq Bent from Saw II, III, and IV).The camera work was a bit more enjoyable in Mother's Day than in a good portion of Bousman's previous works. His work has often been described as having a music video-like quality to it, but Mother's Day never really doesn't feel raw or gritty. A favorite scene of mine is when Addley accidentally shoots somebody in the head, but it's far enough off-screen that you only see the blood splatter. You see everyone else's horrific reactions first before Addley says he didn't mean to do that and you finally see the aftermath. The story is easy to follow and the blood and gore effects are pretty top notch. On the surface, Mother's Day is a home run.The unfortunate thing is I just found myself not caring about the major events in the film. Maybe it's because nearly every character in the film is either a mean-spirited bastard right from the beginning or is revealed to be one through their actions as the film progresses. I'm also just not big on torture movies these days. Mother's Day had this vibe to it that was similar to both Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door and the remake to I Spit on Your Grave in the sense that it was done well, but it just wasn't really enjoyable due to its content. Mother's Day never really gives you somebody to root for. Everyone is tainted in some capacity and while that's interesting on one hand, it makes things a little dull in the long run.Mother's Day is a relentless and brutal journey. While it does feature superb acting, spot-on cinematography, and top notch make-up effects, it just seems to be missing something to really make you feel for these characters and the sadistically tragic experience they were just put through. It's like the film is lacking just an ounce of compassion or doesn't have genuine human qualities correctly balanced out to pull you in. It's not a complete waste of time, but it's not really entirely worthwhile either.The DVD/Blu-ray for Mother's Day is extremely bare bones as the only special feature is Audio Commentary with director Darren Lynn Bousman and actor Shawn Ashmore.Mother's Day is being released as a single disc DVD and a DVD + Blu-ray combo pack on Tuesday, May 8th. The film is rated R for strong brutal bloody violence and torture, pervasive language and some sexual content, is presented in a 2.40:1 widescreen aspect ratio in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (Blu-ray) and Dolby Digital 5.1 (DVD), and is available with both English and Spanish subtitles. It is approximately 112 minutes in length.

1444791,A1UPTW1ZN3ZXLX,B0057JIR0Y,"D. Weinstein ""Wordy D""","[0, 0]","First - this is in no way a real remake of MOTHER'S DAY, the 1980 classic.  This is more of a re-imagining and a pretty decent one at that.  For the real mother's day fans, there are some real snaky references to the original snuck in here all over the place, and for non-fans, this will play just fine.  This is an above-average intruders type film that sees a bunch of young adults being held captive by a wicked mother and her two deviant sons.  The movie does not get real messy and disgusting like the original, but - it does get a bit more hardcore in it's last stretch than you would think, and besides a needlessly weird explanation of the house/money/kidnapping storyline (the less said the better) this film carves out its own identity albeit it's not anything that will stick with you like the original - it's very well made and occasionally jolting.

The story line is completely different and there are only a couple of scenes that would make you even think about the original. The original is a huge influence in my love of the genre. Its awesome. This one was boring. I felt like it was on forever and kept wanting it to end already. Not a good sign. The production values were good, though there wasn't anything special to it. The acting was adequate, and again nothing to write home about. There was a lot of ""action"", i.e. screaming, dying, brouhaha, but it failed to make an impression on me. I wasn't even interested in any of the characters in it, not on the protag side or the antag side, which given how many there were (though some of them hardly had any dialogue and were just filler) is actually an impressive feat, though not a good one.

It's almost non-stop action and very brutal.

But you should watch it!  This home invasion flick yields more action than one could have ever imagined given the premise.  Not only that, but the action often involves chicks doing hardcore tough physical things under believable circumstances including a surprisingly long fight scene with 51-year old Rebecca De Mornay!The Koffin family is a mean one.  When a bank job goes wrong, the three Koffin boys flee to what was their mother's home.  Only, the house was foreclosed and the new owners are having a friendly gathering when the Koffin boys bust in, panicked, and one (Johnny Koffin) is seriously injured.  Daniel and Beth are the hosting couple and they have six guests.The brothers call mother and when she arrives we learn that she is a loving, civil, polite sociopath who provided her boys with their criminal skill set.  We not only learn that, but that stolen money that the boys were sending mother from previous jobs clearly never made it to her...but the new owners don't seem to know anything about it.As this story of domestic attrition progresses, tension increases on many levels.  As Johnny Koffin's injury advances Mother Koffin becomes less intolerant and her boys more temperamental.  While on a ""field trip"" with one of the Koffin's Beth has difficulty finding enough money to meet their demands.  The party guests are pit against one another under plausible circumstances--and the guests find reasons to turn against each other on their own and it's not handled politely.  George (Shawn Ashmore) gets caught revealing Mother Koffin's manipulations to Lydia, who gradually finds George's claims more credible.  And Mother Koffin finds it ever less plausible that the party hosts don't know anything about the money as she discovers Daniel's capacity for lying.The brutality in this film is immediate!  Johnny Koffin's horrible wound is tended, bones are gruelingly crushed, and chunks of flesh palatably slap about.The players include the hosting couple is Daniel (Frank Grillo; Warrior, The Grey) and Beth (Jaime King; Silent Night, My Bloody Valentine).  Beth is credibly horrified, serially fragile, and occasionally strong.  Their house guests include Shawn Ashmore (the X-Men trilogy), Briana Evigan (The Devil's Carnival, Sorority Row) as a refined punkster, Kandyse McClure (Children of the Corn, Carrie), and Jessie Rusu (The Tortured, Saw VI).Mother Koffin (Rebecca De Mornay; Apartment 1303 3D, Identity) is cold, calculating, and evidently went to charm school.  She won't steal an engagement ring that was a family heirloom, but she won't flinch as horrible physical deeds are conducted before their eyes.  But she is not without her own frailty when it comes to seeing her family safely moved from harm's way.  Her boys are brutal but fearful.  The submissive Lydia Koffin (Deborah Ann Woll; True Blood) takes orders without questions.  She seems sweet and out of place, but her obedience is apparent.In the end, the friends attempt to look past their newfound hostilities to work together and escape.  But have they been through too much for that little dream to come true?

1444810,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0057JIR0Y,Mark Turner,"[3, 8]","When I first saw the original MOTHER'S DAY back in the eighties I was conflicted. I found it to be disturbing, vulgar, and gross and yet original and a low budget film that you found yourself forced to watch through to the end and remembering. The remake of that film has none of those attributes.This time around we start with a group of friends christening the new house a young couple has bought. It's obvious that the woman in question isn't quite sure how she feels, but we have no idea why yet. The oddest thing about this gathering is how different each couple seems; as if there is no way that these couples would be friends in real life.The second half of the story revolves around a trio of bank robbers, one of which has been badly wounded during their last heist. Unsure of where to go to escape the net the police have cast to catch them as well as an upcoming hurricane, they head to the safest place they know, their mother's house. The problem is that the house was foreclosed on months before and they haven't kept in touch with their mother to know this.After walking into the house, they confront the couples there and recruit one, who happens to be a doctor, to take care of their brother. Only then do they call their mother on an unsecured line to find out what happened. While waiting for her arrival, they try to figure out to do. The most volatile of the bunch terrorizes the couples in the basement while the smart on attempts to make a plan.Mother shows with their sister in a motor home, their new place to live. It turns out that the special phone she gave them was lost a while back which is why they had no idea what happened. She tries to calm down the couples in the basement and reprimands her boys for their behavior. She seems to be the calm one of the family.But that changes. When they tell her they've been sending her money to this location, she begins asking the new home owners what they did with the money. Both tell her that they never received any packages but she doesn't believe them. She sends the oldest boy out with the woman of the house along with the debit cards of each person there to get money. To escape the country they'll need $10,000. While they're gone, she tries to find the answers as to where the money went.As the story unfolds, the couples begin to turn on each other. Some want to make an attempt to escape, others want to take on the bad guys while a third group just wants to play along with whatever they want. Degradation and torture follow (not nearly as has happened in worse films of this sort) and solutions aren't forthcoming. Just who will survive the night remains to be seen.If you've seen the original film you'll notice tons of changes, the setting being the first. Gone are the two redneck killers from the original to be replaced with three bank robbers. Mother isn't an elderly woman being replaced here by Rebecca DeMornay. Hurricane? Where did that come from? Stolen money? Couples?The original film, though brutal for the time, focused on three friends camping who are captured by two redneck brothers who are encouraged by their mother. It was a story of survival. It took place in the deep back woods in rural America. The only thing this film has in common with the original is death by Drano and an impaled crotch.I have yet to understand why folks who love a film feel the need to revamp it to make it something different. If you loved it, why change it so much? Then again the real reason is easy. It's easy to cash in or get financing when you have a known commodity to help draw people into a theater or to purchase a movie. Unfortunately to date no remake has lived up to the original and this film is proof of that. Which is saying a lot since the original was one of the first films brought to you by the folks at Troma, a company that makes a point of miniscule budgets and plenty of over the top gore. Don't bother with the remake and seek out the original if you're looking for a real horror film.

Violence and gore go way over the top and characters start behaving in very unbelievable ways.Apparently director Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed three of the Saw movies, was trying to appeal to that same audience, but the sad fact is that, with the talent involved here, a more moderate and realistic approach to the material might have appealed to a much broader group of viewers.The screenwriters seem to have borrowed elements from THE DESPERATE HOURS, RESERVOIR DOGS and KEY LARGO in this story about a trio of bank robbing brothers, escaping from a heist that went wrong, who take refuge in their family home, only to discover that their mother doesn't live there any longer.  Instead, they find it occupied by a couple, throwing a party for several friends, and they take them hostage.With one of the trio badly wounded from the robbery, they phone their mother, who arrives to take charge of the situation, which involves the terrorizing and torture of the eight hostages, all of whom have their own dark secrets revealed on this horrifying night.The cast is quite good, particularly Rebecca  De Mornay, who plays the maniacal mother, but even her fine performance dissipates as the movie's blood fest escalates.

I find the victims' lack of action hard to accept since they outnumber their captors and have several responsive opportunities.With that out of the way, MOTHER'S DAY is a visceral experience--brutal, violent, sadistic and intense.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  Directed with an unrelenting ferocity by Darren Bousman (of SAW fame), the movie careens to its violent climax.An excellent cast delivers dynamite performances:  Rebecca DeMornay (HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL) is chilling indeed as Mama, sometimes a June Cleaver doling out birthday cake and transforming into a Joan Crawford wielding a bloody coat-hanger.  Her offspring are psychotic effigies, especially Patrick Flugel (THE 44), Warren Kole (TV's COMMON LAW) and TRUE BLOOD's waifish Deborah Ann Woll.  Frank Grillo (THE GREY) and Jaime King (MY BLOODY VALENTINE) do well as the focal couple while eternally doomed Shawn Ashmore (THE DIVIDE) is good as the young doctor called on to save the wounded robber psycho.MOTHER'S DAY is not an ""entertaining"" film per se but it is a tidy, engrossing experience.",4,THE HAND THAT ROCKED THE CRADLE IS NOW CUTTING CAKE!,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,1332,"['have', 'three', 'major', 'complaints', 'MOTHER', 'DAY', '1-', 'hate', 'ending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why-spoilers', 'know', '2.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'inference', 'Ma', 'Coffin', 'brood', 'are', 'worse', 'hostages', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'one', '3', 'find', 'victims', 'lack', 'action', 'hard', 'accept', 'outnumber', 'captors', 'have', 'several', 'responsive', 'opportunities.With', 'way', 'MOTHER', 'DAY', 'visceral', 'experience', 'brutal', 'violent', 'sadistic', 'intense', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'Directed', 'unrelenting', 'ferocity', 'Darren', 'Bousman', 'SAW', 'fame', 'movie', 'violent', 'climax.An', 'excellent', 'cast', 'delivers', 'dynamite', 'performances', 'Rebecca', 'DeMornay', 'HAND', 'THAT', 'ROCKS', 'THE', 'CRADLE', 'TRIP', 'TO', 'BOUNTIFUL', 'chilling', 'indeed', 'Mama', 'sometimes', 'June', 'Cleaver', 'doling', 'out', 'birthday', 'cake', 'transforming', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'wielding', 'bloody', 'coat-hanger', 'offspring', 'are', 'psychotic', 'effigies', 'especially', 'Patrick', 'Flugel', 'THE', '44', 'Warren', 'Kole', 'TV', 'COMMON', 'LAW', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'waifish', 'Deborah', 'Ann', 'Woll', 'Frank', 'Grillo', 'THE', 'GREY', 'Jaime', 'King', 'MY', 'BLOODY', 'VALENTINE', 'do', 'well', 'focal', 'couple', 'eternally', 'doomed', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'THE', 'DIVIDE', 'good', 'young', 'doctor', 'called', 'save', 'wounded', 'robber', 'psycho.MOTHER', 'DAY', 'not', 'entertaining', 'film', 'se', 'tidy', 'engrossing', 'experience']",Mother's Day [Reg. 2] (2010)

The story doesn't stay very faithful to the original. In this, mama's sons are three bank robbers (Fleuger, Kole, O'Leary) on the run from the law who come ""home"" to hide out. What they don't know is mama lost the house a few months earlier to a foreclosure, and they just arrived while the new owners are throwing a party. Torture and mayhem follows, exposing dark secrets among the partygoers/hostages along the way. The film has some memorable moments for gorehounds and fans of new-age torture porn (especially the 'Saw' crowd) but becomes more and more like a violent crime thriller than a horror movie as it progresses. The acting is a definite plus, with relatively unknown actors giving strong performances that deserve praise.Overall not a bad effort in the least.

1444820,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B0057JIR0Y,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[10, 17]","A rare thing: a slasher/horror remake. Rarer: a worthwhile slasher/horror remake. Unique: a worthwhile remake of a worthless slasher/horror.Legend, and common consensus, has it that 1980's original Mother's Day was a tasteless, exploitative and low rent sort of a picture. It bombed on release, and a cursory look at its trailer gives a fairly good clue as to why.So you wonder how it was that agents for luminaries like Brett Ratner - he of the laterRed Dragon- and Rebecca De Mornay (whose hand once rocked the cradle) came to have nothing more interesting in the script in tray than a re-tread of a lemon.Be that as it may they didn't, and to everyone's surprise they and director Darren Lynn Bousman, whose credits include Saws2,3and 4 (but not Saw 1) - and accordingly can at least claim to be a re-tread specialist - have crafted something surprisingly effective, taut and entertaining from such paucitous material. In fairness, but for the characters' names, they seem to have rewritten the story altogether.A prelude introduces us to a baby snatching gang at work in an obstetrics ward, and in the grisly manner of the security guard's offing, hints as to the sort of entertainment that is coming. But for a backlit spume of blood we don't linger, though: the film pitches us forward to a modest suburban house-warming party some years later. Four couples groove knowingly to disco retro, shoot pool, and bond quite well. Apparently.Catapulting towards them, in a ghastly misunderstanding, are fleeing bank-robber brothers Ike, Adley and Johnny, the last of whom has been shot in flagrante and is in a bad way. They need to get home to - well, to their mum.The problem is - and the moral of the story here is keep up your monthly mortgage payments or your house may be repossessed, and hope like hell your vendor did too - mother has, unbeknownst to the boys, recently been turfed out of the house. And Ike has lost the special phone he was meant to call her on, so the boys don't know this. They arrive in the middle of said housewarming.At which point you have your usual ""get the hell out of my house/no YOU get the hell out of MY house"" standoff, house guests become hostages, indiscriminate violence ensues and mother (now contacted on her other phone) is summoned to sort everything out.Now this must be one hell of a mother.And so she turns out: Rebecca De Mornay arrives, twin-setted and pearled, reprising all her cradle rocking freakiness, to lays out her pitch for the Hannibal Lecter of the new decade. She never gets quite to that point, but the action and suspense is cleverly built and Bousman never quite lets you off the edge of your seat afterwards.You won't be surprised to hear that the superficial sheen binding the hostages starts to dissolve. At the same time we start learning the murderous family's back story, and horrid things start to happen to the poor hostages.Now while, as you'd expect, the film has a pretty nasty undertone (being a gory thriller, and all), it's nothing like as nasty as the original Mother's Day (which seems to have been positively repulsive) and liberals amongst you might take something out of the strength of pretty much all the female characters (for the most part contrasting sharply with the feebleness of the men). That said, I can't see this making a case study for Feminist Studies 101 any time soon.It might, on the other hand, serve as one for a make-up artist's diploma: the are more gruesome injuries (faces shot, heads shot off, gunshot wounds, stab wounds, burns, blisters, splatter on the doors) than I've seen in a while. This tendency to the graphic over the implied detracts rather than adds to the suspense: I didn't find the film scary or horrifying so much as just plain unpleasant.Mother's Day is a serviceable and well-paced film, but (again, as these films seem to be) studded with plot implausibilities: The robbers don't simply turn tail and bolt as soon as they find the house occupied. They imprison their victims in a room containing a rack of pool cues and steak knives (in a presentation box!) The hostages hit each other with the pool cues but not, despite ample opportunity, their captors. And, as is seemingly de rigueur in films of this sort, people who ought really to be well and truly dead have a habit of getting up and continuing to contribute to narrative development.It is also, in the main, well scripted and surprisingly well acted. Eldest son Ike carries the screen well, if he fails to inject quite enough malice: you can't help thinking he's really a nice chap. Younger brother Adley captures the deranged psycho well, and De Mornay's mother is chilling, though she does nibble occasionally on the set, if not completely chewing scenery.The film surges over the credibility (and coherence) line in the last scenes where Bousman's desire to yet further amp up the tension instead undermines it entirely, cascading the picture into farce.This is an honest effort for what it is (I don't have any particular fondness for the genre) although it has trouble deciding whether to be a splatter film or a psychological thriller, a cake you really can't eat and have too. Had a bit more of the violence been implied, I fancy this might have been a more chilling and effective picture.Olly Buxton",3,Not a romantic comedy.,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,5294,"['rare',

One of the secrets is what happened to the money the boys were sending home? George (Shawn Ashmore) is working on pitting the the family against itself.Rebecca De Mornay is the thinking man's David Hess.

They could have gone with a more modern sound track. 5 star home abduction genre film for twisted minds.Blood, torture, f-bombs, sexual situation, no nudity (Briana Evigan  bra / panties strip)",5,DON'T BLINK TWICE!,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,1405,"['typical', 'home', 'abduction', 'movie', 'few', 'twists', 'example', 'home', 'schooling', 'gone', 'bad', 'birthday', 'party', 'going', 'only', 'beautiful', 'young', 'typical', 'movie', 'couples', 'party', 'basement', 'tornado', 'watch', 'three', 'bank', 'robbers', 'enter', 'house', 'thinking', 'live', 'there', 'surprise', 'do', ""n't"", 'keeping', 'times', 'Mom', 'lost', 'home', 'foreclosure.The', 'threesome', 'badly', 'injured', 'Jonathan', ""'Johnny"", 'Koffin', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'who', 'immediate', 'medical', 'attention', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'shortly', 'Ma', 'Barker', 'type', 'cool', 'style', 'Hillary', 'hair-do', 'other', 'two', 'boys', 'Patrick', 'John', 'Flueger', 'Warren', 'Kole', 'daughter', 'Deborah', 'Ann', 'Woll', 'treat', 'humiliated', 'captives', 'proper', 'way', 'expose', 'secrets', 'One', 'secrets', 'what', 'happened', 'money', 'boys', 'were', 'sending', 'home', 'George', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'working', 'pitting', 'family', 'itself.Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'thinking', 'man', 'David', 'Hess', 'methodical', 'manner', 'home', 'break-in', 'cult', 'status', 'home', 'abduction', 'scale', 'film', 'had', 'better', 'average', 'acting', 'writing', 'dialouge', 'directing', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'more', 'modern', 'sound', 'track', '5', 'star', 'home', 'abduction', 'genre', 'film', 'twisted', 'minds.Blood', 'torture', 'f-bombs', 'sexual', 'situation', 'nudity', 'Briana', 'Evigan', 'bra', '/', 'panties', 'strip']",Mother's Day [Reg. 2] (2010)

1444827,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B0057JIR0Y,Tony Heck,"[7, 9]","""Look at me, if someone's lying there will be consequences. I guarantee it."" After three teens commit a crime they run to their mother's house for safety. When they get there they find out that the home was foreclosed on and there are now new people living there. The mother (De Mornay) shows up and begins to take control to get her and her boys out safe. I have to say that going in I was expecting a pretty lame B movie. This was much better then I thought. Very tense and pretty scary in the fact that this movie could actually happen. Imagine having a party with your friends when a group of criminals with guns show up thinking it's their house. What would you do. This movie is made for me by the fact that Rebecca De Mornay is playing a similar character that she played in ""Hand That Rocks The Cradle"". She has the same level of ""normal-creepiness"" that is makes her seem at once normal and insane. To me that is creepy. This is a good watch. Overall, if the woman from ""Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" grew up this is the type of person and movie it would become.
