840056,A17RVQMJP8OMN8,B0002MF67I,D. Eldon,"[3, 5]","This movie starts out well with the play-lot scene and the ending is effective; much more professional than ALL that comes in-between the beginning and the end.  Henry's affected speech and animation along with the nosy neighbor was embarrassing.  The major characters were a little better but still very inexperienced.  And, why is it people carry lanterns around in a house that had electricity on just a few moments earlier?  I guess that adds spook power- not.  Mist, poor lighting, dark rooms, cobwebs, and weird lights were OTT (over the top). The children and costumes were a plus. Too bad the interesting story line suffered under the rest of the movie.",2,"Good Plot, Slow Action",1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,661,"['movie', 'out', 'well', 'play-lot', 'scene', 'ending', 'effective', 'much', 'more', 'professional', 'in-between', 'beginning', 'end', 'Henry', 'affected', 'speech', 'animation', 'nosy', 'neighbor', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'major', 'characters', 'were', 'little', 'better', 'still', 'very', 'inexperienced', 'why', 'people', 'carry', 'around', 'house', 'had', 'electricity', 'just', 'few', 'moments', 'earlier', 'guess', 'spook', 'power-', 'not', 'Mist', 'poor', 'lighting', 'dark', 'rooms', 'cobwebs', 'weird', 'lights', 'were', 'OTT', 'top', 'children', 'costumes', 'were', 'plus', 'Too', 'bad', 'interesting', 'story', 'line', 'suffered', 'rest', 'movie']",N/A

I just knew that it was a BRAIN DAMAGE release and that it was cheap enough to give it a try.Now let me tell you something... That flick is awesome !! I was expecting a low budget gorefest instead I got a REAL SCARY movie : the type that makes your girlfriend grab your arm and that makes you jump in your seat. I mean, the beginners who only know SCREAM and such are going to wet their pants, for real.The plot is simple. A group of old school friends, who all share the guilt of having "" accidently "" caused the death of a nerdy kid during their childhood, are invited to a country hotel. They all meet there, start to party and there you go... weird things start to happen. It soon becomes clear that DEAD CHILDREN are in the house.I've said too much already. It is beautifully shot, most of the actors are allright and even mannage to add some depth to their characters. You care for them and, of course, it makes the whole thing more believable and scary. Now being MR GORYSSIMO I can't give that movie 5 stars because of the gore being too low. But don't get me wrong, INVITATION rules and will, like I said, give enough scares as it is.That movie should'nt be ignored any longer. Take MR GORYSSIMO's word and accept the INVITATION.",4,THE REAL INVITATION TO HELL !!,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,1289,"['ordered', 'movie', 'not', 'knowing', 'thing', 'just', 'knew', 'was', 'BRAIN', 'DAMAGE', 'release', 'was', 'cheap', 'enough', 'give', 'try.Now', 'let', 'tell', 'something', 'flick', 'awesome', 'was', 'expecting', 'low', 'budget', 'gorefest', 'instead', 'got', 'REAL', 'SCARY', 'movie', 'type', 'girlfriend', 'grab', 'arm', 'jump', 'seat', 'mean', 'beginners', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'SCREAM', 'such', 'are', 'going', 'wet', 'pants', 'real.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'group', 'old', 'school', 'friends', 'who', 'share', 'guilt', 'having', 'accidently', 'caused', 'death', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'childhood', 'are', 'invited', 'country', 'hotel', 'meet', 'there', 'start', 'party', 'go', 'weird', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'soon', 'clear', 'DEAD', 'CHILDREN', 'are', 'house.I', ""'ve"", 'said', 'too', 'much', 'already', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'allright', 'even', 'mannage', 'add', 'depth', 'characters', 'care', 'course', 'whole', 'thing', 'more', 'believable', 'scary', 'Now', 'being', 'MR', 'GORYSSIMO', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'gore', 'being', 'too', 'low', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'INVITATION', 'rules', 'will', 'said', 'give', 'enough', 'scares', 'movie', ""should'nt"", 'be', 'ignored', 'longer', 'Take', 'MR', 'GORYSSIMO', 'word', 'accept', 'INVITATION']",N/A
