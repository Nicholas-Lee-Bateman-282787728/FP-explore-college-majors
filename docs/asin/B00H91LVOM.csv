1686278,A1DNAYILPPR7NL,B00H91LVOM,Bookworm2,"[0, 0]","The problem with Sparks is that it's unfocused. Its seems as if the script writer tried to make both plot and character equally important and as a result each suffered from a lack of attention. I wanted to know what happened in the movie, which means that the it had elements of suspense and a potential for excellence, but then the plot got stalled in order to focus on the characters childhood or his thoughts and feelings and then that got stalled to return to the plot. This is not necessarily a bad thing, except one of these (plot or character) should have taken a back seat.The premise (good vs. evil) of the movie was also chewed up in the way the story was told (boy gets a power and uses it for good. Villains also have power, which they use for evil). It felt as if I were on a roller coaster ride that kept stopping and then jerking to start again, moving forward so far and then again jerking to a stop until finally the movie reveals the hero's truth.I'm glad I kept watching until the ending, because the movie has some merit.

1686279,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00H91LVOM,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[11, 14]","I kid you not: I read my first comic book in 1970.  (It was a Batman story, but I honestly don&#8217;t remember any of the specifics.)  Bitten by the superhero bug at such a ripe, young age, the interest naturally stuck with me, and I&#8217;ve been reading them ever since.  To be fair, I don&#8217;t read them as ambitiously as I used to &#8211; I chalk that up to the nurturing on one&#8217;s particular tastes as one gets a bit older or &#8216;long in the tooth,&#8217; as they say.  Still, I&#8217;ve been there through perhaps every television and/or cinematic discovery (or rediscovery) of what quality comic book material looks like once it&#8217;s committed to celluloid.  TV&#8217;s Spider-man.  TV&#8217;s Wonder Woman.  The Incredible Hulk.  All the way up to NBC&#8217;s HEROES, the various Bat-films, and the Marvel flicks.  I certainly wouldn&#8217;t classify myself as any expert on the subject, but I would consider myself to have a modestly learned opinion.That said, I was probably as underwhelmed by SPARKS as I was impressed.  Like any low budget or independent production, it has its relative strengths and weaknesses, and I&#8217;ll be happy to share them with you after this brief qualifier &#8230;(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)A radioactive meteor strikes Earth in the past, killing most of its three hundred victims but gifting a small group (named &#8216;The Rochester 13&#8217;) with not only superhuman abilities but also the capability of passing on their skills to their future offspring.  Ian Sparks (played with noir-fueled sensibilities by Chase Williamson) wasn&#8217;t one of the resulting superheroes, but, after his parents die in a horrific automobile accident, he nevertheless commits himself to the cause of cleaning up the streets.  Years later &#8211; as he continues his crusade &#8211; he relocates to the Big Apple and joins forces with the comely Lady Heavenly (a comely and heavenly Ashley Bell, who graciously bares her midriff for fanboys everywhere).  However, their battle against a demented supervillain known only as Matanza (William Katt) leaves them physically and emotionally scarred.  Can they overcome their greatest failure and eventually find true love again?Despite some modest reservations with the story (I&#8217;ll get to that in a moment), there&#8217;s still plenty to &#8216;dig&#8217; about SPARKS.  Essentially, directors Christopher Folino (who also wrote the source graphic novel as well as the screenplay) and Todd Burrows have dished out a cinematic valentine to comic book stories, quite probably reminiscent of those they read in their youth.  Their visual style owes a lot of inspiration to Warren Beatty&#8217;s DICK TRACY (1990) and Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez&#8217;s SIN CITY (2005) &#8211; two great-looking films worth giving an appreciable nod to &#8211; but with much more of this cobbled together on a vastly lower budget.  (Not an insult, just an honest critical assessment.)  It&#8217;s set during what I believe to be either the late 40&#8217;s or early 50&#8217;s, so there&#8217;s definitely a black-and-white feeling to a fairly limited color palate.  Some of the period detail is quite good while others (again) clearly looks as though it was accomplished on a budget.  However, Folino and Burrows knew how to give their feature the look they wanted, and I&#8217;ll let those accomplishments speak for themselves.But about those story reservations &#8230;At 98 minutes, the bulk of what&#8217;s in here is told via Sparks&#8217; various flashbacks.  Essentially, what you have here is &#8211; like in the comic book &#8211; a narrator telling you a story frame-by-frame.  Where it gets a bit convoluted is that within Sparks&#8217; own flashbacks he even begins recounting other characters&#8217; flashbacks.  (This is entirely necessitated by the fact that several character developments are hidden from the main character deep within the stories others have to tell him.)  While I only found it exclusively confusing on a single occasion (watch closely when Sparks is flashing back to Archer&#8217;s flashbacks), it&#8217;s still not a storytelling frame I strongly encourage anyone else to use.  In fact, I harken to think how the entire motion picture may&#8217;ve been better served by dropping that narrative trickery altogether and just telling the story in present day (with the obligatory subtitles telling us &#8220;three months later&#8221; when it is &#8220;three months later&#8221;).  Who knows?  It may&#8217;ve worked better.Also about that running time, the last twenty minutes felt like they were vastly longer than twenty minutes; and I&#8217;d chalk that up to the narrative device going away (finally!) as everyone&#8217;s been brought up-to-speed.  Clearly, there&#8217;s some fat in here &#8211; for example, Sparks figures out what is superpower is probably thirty minutes after the audience is already keen on it &#8211; and a leaner cut probably would&#8217;ve made this one a true fighting machine.SPARKS: THE ORIGIN OF IAN SPARKS (2013) is produced by Sideshow Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled by Image Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, this low budget superhero film offers up some surprisingly good sights and sounds, and there&#8217;s quite a bit of it that&#8217;s visual punctuated with some quite good cinematography.  If it&#8217;s special features you want, then you have of making-of short to look forward to, along with some obligatory outtakes and an audio commentary by actor William Katt and directors Folino and Burrows: a nice assortment for what is clearly a very personal effort from all involved.RECOMMENDED.  SPARKS is the kind of film that likely has to be already in your wheelhouse of interests for you to truly appreciate what it has to offer.  Stylistically, it borrows heavily from much in the superhero genre that&#8217;s come before, but don&#8217;t look for it to be anywhere near as accomplished as any of the Marvel Comics motion pictures, though it might be a tad more chic and sophisticated than any of the PUNISHER flicks.  Sure, parts of it feel more than a bit derivative, but where there&#8217;s a spark there&#8217;s likely to be a fire.  (See what I did there?)  Passable and mostly kid-friendly, though there are some sexual assault undertones parents may not want to discuss much further than need be.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of SPARKS: THE ORIGIN OF IAN SPARKS by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,A Bit Long ...

I did not anticipate a low-budget DTV being so good.This superhero-noir hybrid amalgamates plot elements from Kick-Ass, The Spirit, and Batman; however, it makes all of those elements darker. Watchmen inspired this movie. This tale's &#34;heroes&#34; operate with all of the morality of the Watchmen. Therefore, like Watchmen, Sparks becomes a morally complex tale appealing to adults.The story's plot, a mystery, is likewise admirably complex, and a person might have to rescreen the DVD to fully follow the movie's events. I admire such craftsmanship. I compliment the Sparks film-makers for creating such a challenging and thought-provoking work. The setting even has a good aesthetic. Like Sin City or Burton's Batman, the setting mixes time periods and certain landscapes. Thereby, it re-presents successfully a fantasy world relatable to our own. Please, check-out this fine movie.

Along with co-director Todd Burrows they brought together a very unique cast and crew to make a very ambitious concept work on the big screen. I applaud the director&#8217;s for their inventive design and nature of making this feature look and feel very good.Basically it&#8217;s the story of &#8220;supers&#8221;, those with special powers and abilities, that were granted to them by a fallen meteorite back in 1920&#8217;s and their legacy both hidden and feared surfaces in the life of Ian Sparks &#8211; a &#8216;super&#8217; who can&#8217;t seem to find his place. Chase Williamson (Video Game High School, The Guest) stars as &#8216;Sparks&#8217;. A strong character who goes through many challenges of the head and heart as various things in his past are revealed. (And, not all them good!) Chase gives a good straightforward performance and has nice on-screen chemistry with his co-star Ashley.Now as for Ashley Bell (The Walking Dead, The Penguins of Madagascar) playing Lady Heavenly, a &#8216;super&#8217; with her own history and ideals that eventually intertwine and mix with Ian&#8217;s and in ways you don&#8217;t see coming. Ashley&#8217;s performance is honest and true and she has a beautiful on screen presence that makes her character bold and venerable at the same time while keeping a sharp edge to her own mysteries. Ashley, also doing her own stunts, was pure excitement to watch and the camera really likes her.Another really powerful performance with duality and intrigue came from Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers, The Shawshank Redemption) as Archer the man who has more twist and turns thank I&#8217;ve seen in a character in a long time and he plays each mystery with a sharper edge than the one before. I liked his energy and almost coy shrewdness toward Ian, but as you learn there is a lot more to him than meets the eye.Jake Busey (Contact, The Killing Jar) also plays an amazing multi-leveled goodie/baddie not quite sure where he&#8217;s coming from or what he&#8217;s about type of guy. I liked his on screen presence and energy when he makes it clear what his mission is about in finding the &#8216;supers&#8217; and it&#8217;s not exactly what you are going to expect.Playing the main baddie, but well hidden with his &#8216;super&#8217; ability is William Katt (The Greatest American Hero, Carrie) who does mean and nasty very well. You&#8217;ll not like him very much when you understand his agenda and what he does to get there. And William plays the witty evilness with a creepy edge.Clint Howard (The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, Apollo 13) gives a fierce and over-the-top performance as the exactly you would expect the film-noir editor to be like. He reminded me of the old film chiefs who always barked their thoughts no matter how crass or inappropriate they were. Clint jumps off the screen when he is on camera.Marina Squerciati (Chicago PD, Gossip Girl) plays Dawn a real &#8216;Super&#8217; with a not so super past but a truly amazing power. Marina plays it to the tee and in her scenes with Ian and Ashley there can be seen a lot of fireworks both visible and not visible.I want to make note of the two wonderful cinematographers Josh Fritts (Turn and Burn) and Jackson Meyers (Escapeseeker) who did an amazing job at giving the warmth and tone of the old film-noir-type films of the past with such vibrant shadows, lines and colors. Even the visual effects made me feel like I was turning the pages of a real live graphic novel but on the big screen. Also the chilling, powerful and haunting score of Jacob Shea (Beyond the Wormhole) really set the mood and tone for the film and was humming that fierce backbeat when I left the theatre.Overall &#8220;Sparks&#8221; is a very stylized film with some great performances, a wonderful score with a real nostalgic look and feel to it and except for some slow moments in the very middle, it has a very interesting beginning and a very insightful unraveling of its characters at the end. It has action, sex, violence, mystery, super powers and a lot of passion.",4,&#8220;Sparks&#8221; Is Engaging And A Visually Fulfilling Independent Film&#8221;,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,4627,"['today', '8217', 's', 'world', '50', '150', 'million', 'plus', 'budget', 'films', 'even', 'ones', 'smallest', 'casts', 'film', 'once', 'while', 'low', 'budget', '8211', 'out', 'sharp', 'sense', 'style', 'intrigue', 'uniqueness', 'watching', 'film', 'know', 'was', 'lot', 'heart', 'passion', 'was', 'put', 'making', '8220', 'Sparks', '8221', 'definitely', 'one', 'films.Taken', 'Graphic', 'Novel', 'same', 'name', 'screenwriter', 'co-director', 'Christopher', 'Folino', 'brought', 'lot', 'imaginative', 'style', 'film', 'noir-like', 'ambiance', 'project', 'co-director', 'Todd', 'Burrows', 'brought', 'together', 'very', 'unique', 'cast', 'crew', 'make', 'very', 'ambitious', 'concept', 'work', 'big', 'screen', 'applaud', 'director', '8217', 's', 'inventive', 'design', 'nature', 'making', 'feature', 'look', 'feel', 'very', 'good.Basically', '8217', 'story', '8220', 'supers', '8221', 'special', 'powers', 'abilities', 'were', 'granted', 'fallen', 'meteorite', 'back', '1920', '8217', 's', 'legacy', 'hidden', 'feared', 'surfaces', 'life', 'Ian', 'Sparks', '8211', '8216', '8217', 'who', 'can', '8217', 'seem', 'find', 'place', 'Chase', 'Williamson', 'Video', 'Game', 'High', 'School', 'Guest', '8216', 'Sparks', '8217', 'strong', 'character', 'who', 'many', 'challenges', 'head', 'heart', 'various', 'things', 'past', 'are', 'revealed', 'not', 'good', 'Chase', 'good', 'straightforward', 'performance', 'nice', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'co-star', 'Ashley.Now', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Penguins', 'Madagascar', 'playing', 'Lady', 'Heavenly', '8216', '8217', 'own', 'history', 'ideals', 'eventually', 'intertwine', 'mix', 'Ian', '8217', 's', 'ways', 'don', '8217', 'see', 'coming', 'Ashley', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'honest', 'true', 'beautiful', 'screen', 'presence', 'character', 'bold', 'venerable', 'same', 'time', 'keeping', 'sharp', 'edge', 'own', 'mysteries', 'Ashley', 'also', 'doing', 'own', 'stunts', 'was', 'pure', 'excitement', 'watch', 'camera', 'really', 'really', 'powerful', 'performance', 'duality', 'intrigue', 'came', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Archer', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'twist', 'thank', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'character', 'long', 'time', 'mystery', 'sharper', 'edge', 'one', 'liked', 'energy', 'almost', 'coy', 'shrewdness', 'Ian', 'learn', 'lot', 'more', 'eye.Jake', 'Busey', 'Contact', 'Killing', 'Jar', 'also', 'amazing', 'multi-leveled', 'goodie/baddie', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', '8217', 'coming', 'what', '8217', 's', 'type', 'guy', 'liked', 'screen', 'presence', 'energy', 'when', 'clear', 'what', 'mission', 'finding', '8216', 'supers', '8217', '8217', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'expect.Playing', 'main', 'baddie', 'well', 'hidden', '8216', '8217', 'ability', 'William', 'Katt', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'Carrie', 'who', 'mean', 'nasty', 'very', 'well', '8217', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'when', 'understand', 'agenda', 'what', 'get', 'there', 'William', 'witty', 'evilness', 'creepy', 'edge.Clint', 'Howard', 'Grinch', 'Who', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'Apollo', '13', 'fierce', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'exactly', 'would', 'expect', 'film-noir', 'editor', 'be', 'reminded', 'old', 'film', 'chiefs', 'who', 'always', 'barked', 'thoughts', 'matter', 'how', 'crass', 'inappropriate', 'were', 'Clint', 'screen', 'when', 'camera.Marina', 'Squerciati', 'Chicago', 'PD', 'Gossip', 'Girl', 'Dawn', 'real', '8216', 'Super', '8217', 'not', 'so', 'super', 'past', 'truly', 'amazing', 'power', 'Marina', 'tee', 'scenes', 'Ian', 'Ashley', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'lot', 'fireworks', 'visible', 'not', 'visible.I', 'want', 'make', 'note', 'two', 'wonderful', 'cinematographers', 'Josh', 'Fritts', 'Turn', 'Burn', 'Jackson', 'Meyers', 'Escapeseeker', 'who', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'giving', 'warmth', 'tone', 'old', 'film-noir-type', 'films', 'past', 'such', 'vibrant', 'shadows', 'lines', 'colors', 'Even', 'visual', 'effects', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'turning', 'pages', 'real', 'live', 'graphic', 'novel', 'big', 'screen', 'Also', 'chilling', 'powerful', 'haunting', 'score', 'Jacob', 'Shea', 'Wormhole', 'really', 'set', 'mood', 'tone', 'film', 'was', 'humming', 'fierce', 'backbeat', 'when', 'left', 'theatre.Overall', '8220', 'Sparks', '8221', 'very', 'stylized', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'wonderful', 'score', 'real', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'feel', 'slow', 'moments', 'very', 'middle', 'very', 'interesting', 'beginning', 'very', 'insightful', 'unraveling', 'characters', 'end', 'action', 'sex', 'violence', 'mystery', 'super', 'powers', 'lot', 'passion']",Sparks

It is a `superhero' tale and based on the graphic novel which tells the story of a meteor crashing to earth causing a genetically mutated group of people who become known as `the Rochester 13'. Then we have the story of the hero or rather `superhero' Ian Sparks (Chase Wiliamson - `John Dies at the End') whose parents are killed in an exploding car incident that was partially caused by the cops.We jump ahead a number of years and Sparks has decided to go out righting wrongs and in the end teams up with Lady Heavenly played by Ashley Bell (`The Day') then they come up against a super villain and the rules of the game change forever... type thing.Well all of that is pretty predictable and I quite liked the suspending belief as you swallowed their stories of woe. It unashamedly plays for the `noir' feeling and in many ways copies `Sin City' with its use of graphics and live action. However, it lacks the pathos of that film and is never consistent with the noir feeling, so at times it feels like we got only half the film that the makers wanted us to see - that may have been down to budget. The action is ok at best and sporadic and you will be amazed at a shotgun that causes no damage to the moving vehicle  it is fired at, whilst killing the passenger.Some have criticised the acting, but I think they had to play it in a kind of cheesy tongue in cheek way as the whole thing is quite unbelievable and some would argue that is as it should be.
