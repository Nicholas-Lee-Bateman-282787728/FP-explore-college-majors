1347789,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B003JQZY80,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[7, 8]","""Still Small Voices"" is about as good as a TV movie could ever hope to be, as it is filled with deep plot twists and compelling characters. It features a tremendous performance by Catherine Bell, who for years has been a vastly underrated actress.Bell stars as Michael, a woman who has just experienced a personal tragedy. Ever since this tragic event, she has experienced events that border on the paranormal, and at first she resists them. But when the voices and visions start to invade her home life and her job (as a 911 operator), she begins to act irrationally. One day at work, she gets an incoming 911 call from a little girl who says she is trapped inside a burning house. But the police and the firemen tell her that not only was there no fire, but that the address does not exist. She begins a frantic search for the little girl, unlocking secrets deep within her past, and taking her to the small secluded town of Starlight, Pennsylvania. While there, she uncovers an old murder investigation from 1979 (involving a little girl with the same name as the girl on the 911 call) that was never solved.As her husband and mother search for her, Michael enlists the help of a veteran detective who was around back in the days of the unsolved case. With his help, Michael battles her own demons as she tries to sort out what is real and what is imagined...and tries to convince the detective that she has new evidence in the case.All in all a great performance by Bell, and the setting/camerawork gives a eerie creepiness to a film that avoids any graphic violence or gore. The fact that this film manages to be so unsettling without any of those gratuitous elements really speaks to how well the story is constructed. And, of course, how convincing Catherine Bell's performance is.",5,A Fantastic TV Movie,1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,1788,"['Still', 'Small', 'Voices', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'TV', 'movie', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'be', 'filled', 'deep', 'plot', 'twists', 'compelling', 'characters', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'who', 'years', 'been', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'actress.Bell', 'stars', 'Michael', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'experienced', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'Ever', 'tragic', 'event', 'experienced', 'events', 'border', 'paranormal', 'first', 'when', 'voices', 'visions', 'start', 'invade', 'home', 'life', 'job', '911', 'operator', 'act', 'irrationally', 'One', 'day', 'work', 'incoming', '911', 'call', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'trapped', 'burning', 'house', 'police', 'firemen', 'tell', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'fire', 'address', 'not', 'exist', 'frantic', 'search', 'little', 'girl', 'unlocking', 'secrets', 'deep', 'past', 'taking', 'small', 'secluded', 'town', 'Starlight', 'Pennsylvania', 'there', 'old', 'murder', 'investigation', '1979', 'involving', 'little', 'girl', 'same', 'name', 'girl', '911', 'call', 'was', 'never', 'solved.As', 'husband', 'mother', 'search', 'Michael', 'help', 'veteran', 'detective', 'who', 'was', 'around', 'back', 'days', 'unsolved', 'case', 'help', 'Michael', 'own', 'demons', 'sort', 'out', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'imagined', 'tries', 'convince', 'detective', 'new', 'evidence', 'case.All', 'great', 'performance', 'Bell', 'setting/camerawork', 'eerie', 'creepiness', 'film', 'graphic', 'violence', 'gore', 'fact', 'film', 'be', 'so', 'unsettling', 'gratuitous', 'elements', 'really', 'how', 'well', 'story', 'constructed', 'course', 'how', 'convincing', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'performance']",N/A

1347791,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003JQZY80,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","If you're at all a fan of JAG or of the Good Witch film series on Hallmark, then chances are you're already clued in to 2007's Still Small Voices. The one common denominator is Catherine Bell, of course, who stars in all of the above. And I don't think it's a reach when I say that Still Small Voices may have featured one of her best, if not her best, performances. Never mind that it's a Lifetime movie.She plays NYC emergency dispatcher Michael Summer, and Michael just isn't ready to return to duty. She's still traumatized, still grieving over her stillborn child. When she responds to a distress call from a six-year-old girl, she learns that no address - in fact, no call - had registered within the 911 operating system. Her concerned boss orders her to take a leave of absence. Michael instead decides to follow up on that phantom call.A key sub-plot concerns her husband's frantic search for her as the haunted Michael goes gallivanting off, trying to piece together whisper-thin clues culled from her nightmares and hallucinatory episodes. Michael is in need of an urgent operation for a brain aneurysm that developed eight or ten weeks ago, and it's just now been found out. And I guess there's your scientific/medical explanation for her alarming episodes. And maybe - and it's farfetched, right? - just maybe, this blood clot has given Michael a tiny window into the paranormal.She ends up driving haphazardly to Pennsylvania, to some small town named Starlight, and it's there that she finally gets answers. Catherine Bell is so very good here. It's rare that she's given her own vehicle to carry, The Good Witch films aside. Mostly, she's featured in supporting roles or as the thankless romantic interest. This little Lifetime movie allows her the space to showcase her acting chops and her range. Little Small Voices works as a wrenching melodrama and as a twisty psychological/psychic thriller. There are moments that may make you jump or give you the heebie-jeebies. Pay close attention because everything does add up in the end (although what was up with that hair-pulling sequence?). I didn't see that ending coming, and didn't expect it to be so moving. The Kleenex company probably made a killing just off this movie. Just know that perspectives are askewed, things are not what they seem. Except that, maybe, the fabled Prince of Stars does watch over all the children. Or he tries, anyway. So, go ahead, make a wish on the Prince of Stars...",4,"""It's time for small voices to be quiet and still...""",1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,2467,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'JAG', 'Good', 'Witch', 'film', 'series', 'Hallmark', 'then', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'already', 'clued', '2007', 'Still', 'Small', 'Voices', 'one', 'common', 'denominator', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'course', 'who', 'above', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'reach', 'when', 'say', 'Still', 'Small', 'Voices', 'may', 'have', 'featured', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'performances', 'Never', 'mind', 'Lifetime', 'movie.She', 'NYC', 'emergency', 'dispatcher', 'Michael', 'Summer', 'Michael', 'just', ""n't"", 'ready', 'return', 'duty', 'still', 'traumatized', 'still', 'grieving', 'stillborn', 'child', 'When', 'distress', 'call', 'six-year-old', 'girl', 'address', 'fact', 'call', 'had', 'registered', '911', 'operating', 'system', 'concerned', 'boss', 'orders', 'take', 'leave', 'absence', 'Michael', 'instead', 'follow', 'up', 'phantom', 'call.A', 'key', 'sub-plot', 'concerns', 'husband', 'frantic', 'search', 'haunted', 'Michael', 'gallivanting', 'off', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'whisper-thin', 'clues', 'culled', 'nightmares', 'hallucinatory', 'episodes', 'Michael', 'need', 'urgent', 'operation', 'brain', 'aneurysm', 'developed', 'eight', 'ten', 'weeks', 'ago', 'just', 'now', 'been', 'found', 'guess', 'scientific/medical', 'explanation', 'alarming', 'episodes', 'maybe', 'farfetched', 'right', 'just', 'maybe', 'blood', 'clot', 'given', 'Michael', 'tiny', 'window', 'paranormal.She', 'up', 'driving', 'haphazardly', 'Pennsylvania', 'small', 'town', 'named', 'Starlight', 'finally', 'answers', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'so', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'rare', 'given', 'own', 'vehicle', 'carry', 'Good', 'Witch', 'films', 'aside', 'Mostly', 'featured', 'supporting', 'roles', 'thankless', 'romantic', 'interest', 'little', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'space', 'showcase', 'acting', 'chops', 'range', 'Little', 'Small', 'Voices', 'wrenching', 'melodrama', 'twisty', 'psychological/psychic', 'thriller', 'are', 'moments', 'may', 'make', 'jump', 'give', 'heebie-jeebies', 'Pay', 'close', 'attention', 'everything', 'add', 'up', 'end', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'hair-pulling', 'sequence', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'so', 'moving', 'Kleenex', 'company', 'probably', 'made', 'killing', 'just', 'movie', 'Just', 'know', 'perspectives', 'are', 'askewed', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'maybe', 'fabled', 'Prince', 'Stars', 'watch', 'children', 'anyway', 'So', 'go', 'ahead', 'make', 'wish', 'Prince', 'Stars']",N/A

I came into this one with the same thought in mind.  Boy was I ever mistaken!  There were twists and turns everywhere.  Every time you think one thing is true...it turns out to be something else.  And the ending...let's just say I never saw that coming!  It literally had me in tears.I have to give huge kudos to Catherine Bell.  She did an amazing job in this movie.  It was great to see her in a completely different role.  I have seen her in JAG and Army Wives and she's terrific, but to see her in a thriller/mystery/suspense movie was great.  She really kept the movie going.Of course I won't give away the ending, but I will say this: in order to understand the movie, you really have to pay attention to every single detail or you will miss something.  The first time I watched it I missed a scene or two and was a little confused.When you see this movie listed on LMN or Lifetime, don't just think that it's another typical Lifetime movie...it's not.

Her problem is that she was able to only get skimpy facts about the address and some vague clues such as the caller asking ""what is your wish"" and ""Starlight"".

It stars Catherine Bell as a dispatcher, Michael Summer who handles 911 calls. Michael is distraught because she has recently suffered a great loss, her baby was stillborn. She is also experiencing extremely painful headaches, and begins to hear voices and see visions of frightening images. One 911 call leaves her deeply troubled, that of a little girl crying out for help in a burning building at an address that no one is able to find.Eventually, the little girl's voice leads Michael to a little town called Starlight in Pennsylvania, where Michael learns of the tragic drowning of a young girl. But something is not right, as Michael's instincts and the voices soon unravel a tragic story of lost little girls who had been abducted. At the same time, Michael's headaches turn out to be life-threatening, yet she refuses to seek medical attention, believing time is running out, and is determined to solve the mystery of the lost little girls. This is not a story about a psychic finding lost children, but something even more extraordinary, and there are lots of suspense and twists in this movie that will keep viewers guessing till the very last scene.Though I have a fondness for Lifetime dramas, I do find them to be quite generic at times, but ""Still Small Voices"" breaks the mold. The plot is tightly-woven and credibly acted, especially by Michael Bell, and there is a high degree of tension and suspense throughout.
