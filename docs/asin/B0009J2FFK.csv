Many years ago I managed to buy a then-rare VHS copy on eBay and now it's finally in dvd (definitely an improvement)!  By no means must you be a child to enjoy this movie, as I think people of any age would like it.",5,Very nostalgic!,1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,477,"['remember', 'going', 'see', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'theaters', 'really', 'am', 'old', 'only', 'story', 'very', 'charming', 'was', 'filmed', 'Berlin', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'Wall', 'went', 'up', 'led', 'lifelong', 'fascination', 'city', 'Many', 'years', 'managed', 'buy', 'then-rare', 'VHS', 'copy', 'eBay', 'now', 'finally', 'dvd', 'definitely', 'improvement', 'means', 'must', 'be', 'child', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'think', 'people', 'age', 'would', 'like']",N/A

On the train a pickpocket steals his money.. In actuality, the pickpocket is part of a bigger plan lead by a crime boss known as the Baron (Walter Slezak), to rob a bank, and since the police will not pay attention to a group of kids, they must stay on the case themselves. A Berloin boy nhamed Gustav (Roger Mobley) has a number of business including as a tour guide, a detective, and other assorted jobs, and basically harasses Emil into hiring him after the police ignore Emil. It turns out that Gustav has a whole team of boy detectives.BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: The story idea for ""Emil and the Detectives"" comes from the beloved German classic children's book of the same name by Erich Kastner. It was turned into a screenplay by A. J. Carothers who had come to the Disney Studio a few years earlier to write the screenplay for ""Miracle of the White Stallion"" and ""The Happiest Millionaire"".Directed by Peter Tewksbury. Thankfully this film was made on location in West Germany which makes it much more authentic than it would have been if made at the Disney Studio backlot in Burbank. The wonderful music score is by Heinz Schreiter, and played by the Berliner Symphony. In fact most of the cast and key crew were from Germany, including the cinematographer, art directors, cameramen, production manager, makeup, and others. Released in theatres on December 18, 1964. The movie was later serialized on ""The New Mickey Mouse Club"" under a different title, ""The Three Shrinks"". It aired on the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" as 2 episodes beginning on September 11, 1966, and again five years later on May 9, 1971. It was released to VHS in 1987, and has not been republished since. 99 minutes in length.This charming little gem from the Disney vault has not been seen anywhere for about 30 years. If you can get the 1987 VHS copy, snap it up as it is the only way to see the film now. From then until this review in 2007 it has not been re-released in any format and I don't know if they ever will. The film is interesting conceptually and has a very European feel to it. As a classic book I enjoyed as a child, it was fun to see it as a movie. The reviewers of the time liked the film, and so did I. The story is interesting and great fun for kids to get to see children their own age running a detective agency. But I also enjoyed the cultural aspects of the film, the German trains, buses, cars, hotels, restaurants, signs, and hotels of the early 1960's are a visual treat. Even the police squad cars are all period Volkswagen beetles. The music fits the film just right. The kids are good actors, very charming and fun to watch. On the down side the boys voices and accents are very American, and it is jarring in the beginning, made more so by the fact that 15 minutes into the movie is the first time you hear them speak. Heinz Schubert is a great physical actor as the pickpocket and is hilarious.This film is also available at Amazon on VHS.",5,"Rare treat, filmed in Germany",1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,3105,"['STORY', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Emil', 'Bryan', 'Russell', 'Germany', 'put', 'bus', 'Berlin', 'visit', 'grandmother', 'deliver', 'money', 'train', 'pickpocket', 'money..', 'actuality', 'pickpocket', 'part', 'bigger', 'plan', 'lead', 'crime', 'boss', 'known', 'Baron', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'rob', 'bank', 'police', 'will', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'group', 'kids', 'must', 'stay', 'case', 'Berloin', 'boy', 'nhamed', 'Gustav', 'Roger', 'Mobley', 'number', 'business', 'including', 'tour', 'guide', 'detective', 'other', 'assorted', 'jobs', 'basically', 'Emil', 'hiring', 'police', 'ignore', 'Emil', 'out', 'Gustav', 'whole', 'team', 'boy', 'detectives.BEHIND', 'THE', 'SCENES', 'TRIVIA', 'story', 'idea', 'Emil', 'Detectives', 'beloved', 'German', 'classic', 'children', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Erich', 'Kastner', 'was', 'turned', 'screenplay', 'A.', 'J.', 'Carothers', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'Disney', 'Studio', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'write', 'screenplay', 'Miracle', 'White', 'Stallion', 'Happiest', 'Millionaire', '.Directed', 'Peter', 'Tewksbury', 'Thankfully', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'location', 'West', 'Germany', 'much', 'more', 'authentic', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Disney', 'Studio', 'backlot', 'Burbank', 'wonderful', 'music', 'score', 'Heinz', 'Schreiter', 'played', 'Berliner', 'Symphony', 'fact', 'most', 'cast', 'key', 'crew', 'were', 'Germany', 'including', 'cinematographer', 'art', 'directors', 'cameramen', 'production', 'manager', 'makeup', 'others', 'Released', 'theatres', 'December', '18', '1964', 'movie', 'was', 'later', 'serialized', 'New', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'different', 'title', 'Three', 'Shrinks', 'aired', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', '2', 'episodes', 'beginning', 'September', '11', '1966', 'again', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'May', '9', '1971', 'was', 'released', 'VHS', '1987', 'not', 'been', 'republished', '99', 'minutes', 'length.This', 'charming', 'little', 'gem', 'Disney', 'vault', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'anywhere', '30', 'years', 'can', 'get', '1987', 'VHS', 'copy', 'snap', 'up', 'only', 'way', 'see', 'film', 'now', 'then', 'review', '2007', 'not', 'been', 're-released', 'format', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ever', 'will', 'film', 'interesting', 'conceptually', 'very', 'European', 'feel', 'classic', 'book', 'enjoyed', 'child', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'time', 'liked', 'film', 'so', 'did', 'story', 'interesting', 'great', 'fun', 'kids', 'get', 'see', 'children', 'own', 'age', 'running', 'detective', 'agency', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'cultural', 'aspects', 'film', 'German', 'trains', 'buses', 'cars', 'hotels', 'restaurants', 'signs', 'hotels', 'early', '1960', 'are', 'visual', 'treat', 'Even', 'police', 'squad', 'cars', 'are', 'period', 'Volkswagen', 'beetles', 'music', 'film', 'just', 'right', 'kids', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'very', 'charming', 'fun', 'watch', 'down', 'side', 'boys', 'voices', 'accents', 'are', 'very', 'American', 'jarring', 'beginning', 'made', 'more', 'so', 'fact', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'hear', 'speak', 'Heinz', 'Schubert', 'great', 'physical', 'actor', 'pickpocket', 'hilarious.This', 'film', 'also', 'available', 'Amazon', 'VHS']",N/A

He also played in another movie I liked called The Boy who caught a crook (1961), great movie. I know it is dated since they used the term Marks instead of Eurodollars. Anyway Emil Tischbein (played by Bryan Russel) had carried 400 Marks with him to bring to his Grandmother. A thief who had been stalking him finally robbed him of his money. Emil hires a group of junior detectives to help chase down this thief. It turns out that the thief is working with two other men to rob a bank.
