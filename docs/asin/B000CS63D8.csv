962313,ALWB64XOXNMDP,B000CS63D8,Picardfan007,"[3, 3]","This version of the X-Men is far from perfect. However the storylines have been adapted pretty much the way they were from the comics.  I do have to question the motivations of the packagers of this show.  I was fortunate to purchase this at Wal-Mart for $9.99.  Other retailers are charging more.The animation reminds me style of Batman: The Animated Series. Unlike the 90's version, the figures are all streamlined and devoid of details.  I suppose it's more affordable to get them on the air. If I were producing this show I'd make an attempt to use CGI for the figures.  I can't help but think that someone along the line said how the show has to be produced economically. It's only that the CGI shows get the ratings.  It's too bad some executive at Marvel doesn't say if we want to stay on the air and sell DVD's CGI will keep the fans coming back.On the stories, I am glad it isn't just one of those kid versions of the characters.  The new Spectacular Spiderman seems be interested in just the pre teen fans.  The best aspect of some the latest Marvel's are the fact that they try to attract the adult fans. These aren't strictly Saturday Morning type toons.",2,Good show but too few episodes on one disc,1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,1166,"['version', 'X-Men', 'far', 'perfect', 'However', 'storylines', 'have', 'been', 'adapted', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'were', 'comics', 'do', 'have', 'question', 'motivations', 'packagers', 'show', 'was', 'fortunate', 'purchase', 'Wal-Mart', '9.99', 'Other', 'retailers', 'are', 'charging', 'more.The', 'animation', 'style', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', '90', 'version', 'figures', 'are', 'streamlined', 'devoid', 'details', 'suppose', 'more', 'affordable', 'get', 'air', 'were', 'producing', 'show', ""'d"", 'make', 'attempt', 'use', 'CGI', 'figures', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'someone', 'line', 'said', 'how', 'show', 'be', 'produced', 'economically', 'only', 'CGI', 'get', 'ratings', 'too', 'bad', 'executive', 'Marvel', ""n't"", 'say', 'want', 'stay', 'air', 'sell', 'DVD', 'CGI', 'will', 'keep', 'fans', 'coming', 'stories', 'am', 'glad', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'kid', 'versions', 'characters', 'new', 'Spectacular', 'Spiderman', 'be', 'interested', 'just', 'pre', 'teen', 'fans', 'best', 'aspect', 'latest', 'Marvel', 'are', 'fact', 'try', 'attract', 'adult', 'fans', 'are', ""n't"", 'strictly', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'type', 'toons']",Wolverine and the X-Men: Deadly Enemies
