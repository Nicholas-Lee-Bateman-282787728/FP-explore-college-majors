The title begs the question: Is Patrick really evil? He sure is. It starts out weird, people doing odd things in the vicinity of the pretty new nurse Kathy. A handsome suitor spits at her; her dour superior is dressing Kathy down, but can't stop her hands from shaking so badly there are pills spilling all over the floor. One suitor crushes his wind glass, another burns the flesh off his palms by pressing them into a hot sandwich drill.

1694624,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00IO03I5M,Doug Park,"[2, 2]","{3.5 stars}Low budget Australian affair about an obscure and remote mental ""hospital"" whose star patient, Patrick, forges a bloody bond with new smart and able but unsuspecting nurse Kathy Jacquard (Sharni Vinson). The opening prologue seems to promise another predictably lame slasher flick, and the entire film is a little slow to develop, yet the last half-hour or so entails some interesting and creative layers and twists. This film becomes a lot more distinct once we get to know Patrick's story. Decent all-around acting, with good performances by the three women who play the nurses: Vinson, Rachel Griffiths, and Peta Sergeant.It seems the makers were trying to create a circa 1950 gothic horror film set in the age of GPS with modern horror tropes (something like that). A nice attempt, but PATRICK would still have been better if it were more consistently modern. Many of the props (nurses' uniforms, etc) look unrealistically antiquated, and the outside views of the hospital. . .well, you can tell that it's a prop. The constant rubber stamp suspense symphony soundtrack also gets a little annoying--There's just no need for it except in a few select spots. All the same, none of the various weaker points should get too much in the way if you're a big horror fan.Some brief ""incidental"" nudity and a fair measure of really nasty-gory death and dismemberment.

1694625,A1WODHQ4IPYSAE,B00IO03I5M,Duane,"[1, 2]","Plot - ImdbWhen a young nurse begins work at an isolated psychiatric ward, she quickly becomes fascinated with Patrick, a brain dead patient who is the subject of a mad scientist's cruel and unusual experiments. What starts as an innocent fascination quickly takes a sinister turn as Patrick begins to use his psychic powers to manipulate her every move, and send her life into a terrifying spiral out of control.Review - 4/5Heads up dear readers, this appears to be a remake of the 1978 filmPatrick. I haven't watched the original so I cannot compare. I had the pleasure watching this one online before the DVD comes out in June. It's very hard to find a B-Grade horror worth watching nowadays, but I was quite intrigued by the first few minutes and was glad I watched it. You may even recognize the lead actress Sharni Vinson who also played the lead in the horror filmYou're Next. The director Mark Hartley has directed mostly documentaries and I was surprised at what a quality film he put together. First and foremost, some of this film is really dark. Not as in twisted, but the film is dark in color. It takes place mostly in a dark mansion so you may need to adjust your screens brightness. The film itself isn't scary but more of a thrilling and dramatic type horror. It builds slowly until the plot finally reveals itself. Kudos to Charles Dance for playing a brilliant and sinister mad scientist. Definitely worth a one time watch for any horror fan. It's not all blood and guts or a film trying to scare you by having jumps here and there. Well told story and good acting all around.",4,Now you made Patrick angry,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,1595,"['Plot', 'young', 'nurse', 'work', 'isolated', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'quickly', 'fascinated', 'Patrick', 'brain', 'dead', 'patient', 'who', 'subject', 'mad', 'scientist', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'experiments', 'What', 'innocent', 'fascination', 'quickly', 'sinister', 'turn', 'Patrick', 'use', 'psychic', 'powers', 'manipulate', 'move', 'send', 'life', 'terrifying', 'spiral', 'control.Review', '4/5Heads', 'dear', 'readers', 'be', 'remake', '1978', 'filmPatrick', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'original', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'one', 'online', 'DVD', 'out', 'June', 'very', 'hard', 'find', 'B-Grade', 'horror', 'watching', 'nowadays', 'was', 'quite', 'intrigued', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'was', 'glad', 'watched', 'may', 'even', 'recognize', 'lead', 'actress', 'Sharni', 'Vinson', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'lead', 'horror', 'filmYou', ""'re"", 'Next', 'director', 'Mark', 'Hartley', 'directed', 'mostly', 'documentaries', 'was', 'surprised', 'what', 'quality', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'First', 'foremost', 'film', 'really', 'dark', 'Not', 'twisted', 'film', 'dark', 'color', 'place', 'mostly', 'dark', 'mansion', 'may', 'need', 'adjust', 'screens', 'brightness', 'film', ""n't"", 'scary', 'more', 'thrilling', 'dramatic', 'type', 'horror', 'slowly', 'plot', 'finally', 'Kudos', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'playing', 'brilliant', 'sinister', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Definitely', 'one', 'time', 'watch', 'horror', 'fan', 'not', 'blood', 'guts', 'film', 'trying', 'scare', 'having', 'jumps', 'here', 'there', 'Well', 'told', 'story', 'good', 'acting']",Patrick
1694626,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00IO03I5M,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[2, 2]","Not my most enthusiastic recommendation but definitely a well done film, in terms of production, acting, story... Its a solid flick. The feel of it is as if its set in older times but its not. We see a cell phone and video chat at one point. Otherwise, its got a real retro vibe. The atmosphere is decent. There are some creepier moments and there's some action, mostly toward the end. For the most part, it's a quieter, more reflective, subtle kind of film that finishes off with a bit of a bang. It keeps the mind engaged, as you don't know Patrick's story until the end. Its gradually revealed through flashbacks. However, by the end, I felt like the character of Patrick was not very well fleshed out. We only learn a few things about him, those that immediately and directly relate to the plot. Nothing else really. There wasn't much put out there in terms of what makes Patrick tick. Some insinuated mommy issues... And when the Matron  finally reveals some of what she knows, its not really much. Patrick must've done something to her for her to feel the way she did about him. I just don't know what. Addressing some of this might've given the movie some more opportunity to punch. But again, there was very little to watch (that were like 'horrible' movies vs. horror movies) so I'm grateful that Patrick was around at all.",4,"Horror Junkie's review: In very dry times for horror, this one was better than most",1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,1332,"['Not', 'most', 'enthusiastic', 'recommendation', 'definitely', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'terms', 'production', 'acting', 'story', 'solid', 'flick', 'feel', 'set', 'older', 'times', 'not', 'see', 'cell', 'phone', 'video', 'chat', 'one', 'point', 'Otherwise', 'got', 'real', 'retro', 'vibe', 'atmosphere', 'decent', 'are', 'creepier', 'moments', 'action', 'mostly', 'end', 'most', 'part', 'quieter', 'more', 'reflective', 'subtle', 'kind', 'film', 'bit', 'bang', 'mind', 'engaged', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Patrick', 'story', 'end', 'gradually', 'revealed', 'flashbacks', 'However', 'end', 'felt', 'character', 'Patrick', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'only', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'immediately', 'directly', 'relate', 'plot', 'Nothing', 'else', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'put', 'out', 'there', 'terms', 'what', 'Patrick', 'tick', 'insinuated', 'mommy', 'issues', 'when', 'Matron', 'finally', 'what', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'Patrick', 'must', ""'ve"", 'done', 'something', 'feel', 'way', 'did', 'about', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Addressing', 'might', ""'ve"", 'given', 'movie', 'more', 'opportunity', 'punch', 'again', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'watch', 'were', ""'horrible"", 'movies', 'horror', 'movies', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'Patrick', 'was', 'around']",Patrick

1694630,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B00IO03I5M,Ron,"[0, 1]","Patrick (2013) is a remake of Patrick (1978) and both are from the ""land down under"". I haven't watched the 78 version yet so I can't compare the two films.The new version is a mixture of mad scientist Dr. Roget (Charles Dance), psychological thriller, Sci-Fi, suspense drama with some horror mixed in as a binder.The movies pacing is somewhat slow as the story of Patrick's (Jackson Gallagher) life and the mad doctors experiments are reviled to the viewer through nurse Kathy (Sharon Vinson) interactions with Patrick and the supporting cast of nurses, patients, Kathy's boyfriend and a local Psychologist turned radio talk show host.The movie relies heavily on timed musical notes, dim lighting, ominous dark sky scapes and some excellent cinematography to aid the script in setting the mood and tone as well as trying to add suspense to the movie.For me some of thses same features did more harm than good and instead of adding fear or tension in key scenes they announced  the impending scene and thus losing the element of surprise for the viewer.The mad Dr. played by Gallagher does an effective job as the Dr. under extreme pressure to get results by awaking his comatose patients (mainly Patrick) before he looses his funding. The good Dr's. is willing to do whatever it takes to get results as does his daughter Matron Cassidy (Rachel Griffiths) who is in charge of the nursing staff.The acting overall is pretty good from the lead characters and the supporting cast are just as effective in their given roles. The direction needs some polishing, but is otherwise effective. The writing is also effective, but it too could use a touch of polishing as the story does drag a bit and could have been shortened to keep from fizzling out as much as it does.The excellent camera work was the star in this movie and it alone was worth the time to watch this ok hybrid movie.The movie contains some cursing including the f...word, but overall not a lot of cursing is used in the movie. There is a fair amount of both male and female nudity including full frontal in very short flashes. The violence is held to a minimum (a murder and people being thrown about) and there is very little blood or gore(needles being stuck in an?) for the genre.The movie is well made, but lacks suspense, fear or any creepy/scary factor and isn't that what we are looking for in this type of movie???3+ stars.",3,PATRICK NEEDS MORE JUICE,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,2392,"['Patrick', '2013', 'remake', 'Patrick', '1978', 'are', 'land', 'down', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', '78', 'version', 'yet', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'films.The', 'new', 'version', 'mixture', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Roget', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Sci-Fi', 'suspense', 'drama', 'horror', 'mixed', 'binder.The', 'movies', 'pacing', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'story', 'Patrick', 'Jackson', 'Gallagher', 'life', 'mad', 'doctors', 'experiments', 'are', 'reviled', 'viewer', 'nurse', 'Kathy', 'Sharon', 'Vinson', 'interactions', 'Patrick', 'supporting', 'cast', 'nurses', 'patients', 'Kathy', 'boyfriend', 'local', 'Psychologist', 'turned', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'host.The', 'movie', 'relies', 'heavily', 'timed', 'musical', 'notes', 'dim', 'lighting', 'ominous', 'dark', 'sky', 'scapes', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'aid', 'script', 'setting', 'mood', 'tone', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'add', 'suspense', 'movie.For', 'thses', 'same', 'features', 'did', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'instead', 'adding', 'fear', 'tension', 'key', 'scenes', 'announced', 'impending', 'scene', 'thus', 'losing', 'element', 'surprise', 'viewer.The', 'mad', 'Dr.', 'played', 'Gallagher', 'effective', 'job', 'Dr.', 'extreme', 'pressure', 'get', 'results', 'awaking', 'comatose', 'patients', 'mainly', 'Patrick', 'funding', 'good', 'Dr', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'get', 'results', 'daughter', 'Matron', 'Cassidy', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'who', 'charge', 'nursing', 'staff.The', 'acting', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'lead', 'characters', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'just', 'effective', 'given', 'roles', 'direction', 'polishing', 'otherwise', 'effective', 'writing', 'also', 'effective', 'too', 'could', 'use', 'touch', 'polishing', 'story', 'drag', 'bit', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shortened', 'keep', 'fizzling', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'excellent', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'star', 'movie', 'alone', 'was', 'time', 'watch', 'ok', 'hybrid', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'cursing', 'including', 'f', 'word', 'overall', 'not', 'lot', 'cursing', 'used', 'movie', 'fair', 'amount', 'male', 'female', 'nudity', 'including', 'full', 'frontal', 'very', 'short', 'flashes', 'violence', 'held', 'minimum', 'murder', 'people', 'being', 'thrown', 'very', 'little', 'blood', 'gore', 'needles', 'being', 'stuck', 'genre.The', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'suspense', 'fear', 'creepy/scary', 'factor', ""n't"", 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'type', 'movie', '3+', 'stars']",Patrick
