835023,A231FGX8G2Q5EW,B0002I84JO,,"[16, 16]","I have tried 7, yes seven different headsets b4 I finally stopped at this one. The Motorola v551 gsm is a hard model to pair up with a compatible, comfortable, reliable & problem free bluetooth headset. I've tried 3 different Jabra models. The bt800 was intresting, but it was heavy & hurt my ear after wearing it longer than an hour. The bt110 & bt250 both of which would hang up on my caller, and call any numbers in my phone book at random whenever they saw fit. I tried the motorola hs850 (heavy) and the hs820, hs810 models, all had volume issues. Then One day I read some reviews on this model paired to my particular phone on Cnet.com. All the reviews had the same thing in commom, ""works terrific with the v551gsm model"". This is by far the most versitle, compact, lighweight, comfortable, and easy to use headset. The volume button is away from any answer/disconnect button so you don't accidently hang up on your caller. The volume button also serves as a mute button, just push it in for about 3 seconds and you get a double beep about every three to four seconds to remind you that you have a caller on hold.. cool! It has many features of the higher end models such as, voice command dialing, auto answer, 9 hours talk time, call toggling, redial. It takes the guess work out of trying to tell if your phone is turing on/off with two seperate led colors. Fast/pulsing blue when activated/on, and fast pulsing red when it's shuttng down. The volume on this headset is more than adequate. When bombing around in my late model MR2 with race engine, it gets a tad loud in the mid engine car. This headset meets and passes the noise test with flying colors. The jury is still out regarding the patented ""Clear sound"" technology that this model boasts. It states that you can have clear high quality audio even under windy outdoor conditions. The few times I used this outside it was a tad breezy, wind speeds anywhere from 1-5 miles an hour. Each time the wind would distort the caller and the response from the other end was, ""Your breaking up, I can't hear you"". It was only when I would turn my back towards the wind that the reception would become clear again.. Hmmmmmmm? Aside from the last niggling issue, I couldn't be more happier with this headset. The best thing of all was that it cost me only $37.00 including shipping & handling",4,Impressive...

Would it be anotherdisappointment, as so many gay-themed movies are?What a nice surprise.  While it starts out with scenesof tired gay banter among stereotypical gay guys and theirfriends in West Hollywood, when some Mormon missionariesarrive in the neighborhood, the film turns into a movingstory of self-discovery for the not-yet-jaded ""Christian"",already decidedly gay, but just youthful enough to beundecided about how he wants to be gay, and the newcomerMormon kid from Idaho, Aaron, very well played by a newcomerto the screen, Steve Sandvoss.  Aaron seems closeted fromthe start and we know what is going to happen, or at leastwe know that there is going to be a lot of tension and perhapsa resolution before the movie ends.  And though there are someformulaic developments here, there are also some surprises.Steve Sandvoss (probably not a stage name) plays the partof a scared Mormon beautifully and convincingly, and whileI guess I got the the (presumably cut) R rated version,rather than the unrated version, the love scenes are all themore moving and exciting by their not being explicitly sexual,unlike the mechanical and casual scenes and references we seein Christian's personal life early in the film.On balance, though I know films and novels need not serve associal tools to advance causes or even tolerance, I see thisfilm, along with just a handful of others, as presenting apositive model of relationships for serious people, gay or straight.With all the focus on AIDS, death, gay-bashing,etc. in many plays, films, and books over the past two decades,however necessary and appropriate that may have been, it'snice to see a love story that touches peripherally on thosesubjects, rather than centering on them. As we see Christianadministering help to an AIDS patient, we sense him realizingthat he has a choice, especially as the dying man tells himthat he had been just like Christian not too long ago.And we see Christian turning away from the busy, dizzy lifestyle,and wanting something more, and different.There are some familiar faces and players in the supportingcast, including Jaqueline Bisset, Mary Kay Place, and JosephGordon-Levitt (who might have been an equally good choice forthe protagonist, and in any event might have had a biggerpart).  It also would have been nice to see some flashbacksof Aaron's growing up in Idaho or the other Mormon boys'life experiences. That could have taken only a few more minutesand made for a better film, I think.Having some acquaintance with the issue of homosexuality inthe Mormon church, I can say that the characterization ofthe reaction of Aaron's friends, family, and church are notin any way exaggerated in this film.This is one of the best gay-themed films of the past two decades.",4,Surprising romantic gay drama blazes new trail,1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,2905,"['Somehow', 'missed', 'press', 'reviews', 'film', 'when', 'itcame', 'only', 'discovered', 'video', 'store', 'always', 'full', 'lousy', 'movies', 'Would', 'be', 'anotherdisappointment', 'so', 'many', 'gay-themed', 'movies', 'are', 'What', 'nice', 'surprise', 'out', 'scenesof', 'tired', 'gay', 'banter', 'stereotypical', 'gay', 'guys', 'theirfriends', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'when', 'Mormon', 'missionariesarrive', 'neighborhood', 'film', 'movingstory', 'self-discovery', 'not-yet-jaded', 'Christian', 'already', 'decidedly', 'gay', 'just', 'youthful', 'enough', 'beundecided', 'how', 'be', 'gay', 'newcomerMormon', 'kid', 'Idaho', 'Aaron', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'newcomerto', 'screen', 'Steve', 'Sandvoss', 'Aaron', 'closeted', 'fromthe', 'start', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'leastwe', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'lot', 'tension', 'perhapsa', 'resolution', 'movie', 'are', 'someformulaic', 'developments', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'surprises.Steve', 'Sandvoss', 'probably', 'not', 'stage', 'name', 'partof', 'scared', 'Mormon', 'beautifully', 'convincingly', 'whileI', 'guess', 'got', 'presumably', 'cut', 'R', 'rated', 'version', 'rather', 'unrated', 'version', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'moving', 'exciting', 'not', 'being', 'explicitly', 'sexual', 'mechanical', 'casual', 'scenes', 'references', 'seein', 'Christian', 'personal', 'life', 'early', 'film.On', 'balance', 'know', 'films', 'novels', 'need', 'not', 'serve', 'associal', 'tools', 'advance', 'causes', 'even', 'tolerance', 'see', 'thisfilm', 'just', 'handful', 'others', 'presenting', 'apositive', 'model', 'relationships', 'serious', 'people', 'gay', 'straight.With', 'focus', 'AIDS', 'death', 'gay-bashing', 'etc', 'many', 'plays', 'films', 'books', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'however', 'necessary', 'appropriate', 'may', 'have', 'been', ""it'snice"", 'see', 'love', 'story', 'peripherally', 'thosesubjects', 'rather', 'centering', 'see', 'Christianadministering', 'help', 'AIDS', 'patient', 'sense', 'realizingthat', 'choice', 'especially', 'dying', 'man', 'himthat', 'had', 'been', 'just', 'Christian', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago.And', 'see', 'Christian', 'turning', 'away', 'busy', 'dizzy', 'lifestyle', 'wanting', 'something', 'more', 'are', 'familiar', 'players', 'supportingcast', 'including', 'Jaqueline', 'Bisset', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'JosephGordon-Levitt', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'equally', 'good', 'choice', 'forthe', 'protagonist', 'event', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'biggerpart', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'flashbacksof', 'Aaron', 'growing', 'up', 'Idaho', 'other', 'Mormon', ""boys'life"", 'experiences', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'only', 'few', 'more', 'minutesand', 'made', 'better', 'film', 'think.Having', 'acquaintance', 'issue', 'homosexuality', 'inthe', 'Mormon', 'church', 'can', 'say', 'characterization', 'reaction', 'Aaron', 'friends', 'family', 'church', 'are', 'notin', 'way', 'exaggerated', 'film.This', 'one', 'best', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'past', 'two', 'decades']",N/A

I have been waiting for the DVD for a long time; it does not disapoint.Most people will want to know about the extras. None of the deleted scenes show any additional nudity. Since I got to talked to most of the people involved in the film after the screening, the commentary was slightly disapointing. Yes, the director, C. Jay Cox, filled in a lot of the blanks and was especially good in talking about the long nude scene and the music. The two stars of the film, Steve Sandvoss and Wes Ramsey, also comment with Ramsey doing most of the talking.  Sandvoss says very little and that was not the shy but outgoing person whom I met briefly in Philly.Thankfully the real Steve Sandvoss is present in the behind the scenes featurette where he gets a chance to talk more about himself and playing a gay character. (Yes, I know I just met his briefly.) Steve is very relaxed and forthcoming about what is certainly a brake out role for him.The transfer to DVD is excellent.

Aaron is a 19-year old Mormon Church trainee missionary from Idaho sent to LA for training. In LA, he and his fellow missionaries move in next door to the handsome playboy, Christian. Aaron and Christian are as different as night and day - Aaron is blond, serious and shy while the dark-haired Christian has a vibrant personality and a dress-sense that's as colorful as the rainbow. Despite the differences, their attraction to each other is evident from the moment they first meet. I really love the 2 characters, brilliantly played by Steve Sandvoss and Wes Ramsey. Both actors are incredibly good-looking and endearing to watch. Sandvoss' ""Aaron"" is so wholesome-looking (in the novel, his face is described as being like ""...carved from soap - Ivory soap, 99.9% pure"". You get the picture) and he has the handsomest nose and a great physique too! Ramsey's ""Christian"" is like a Calvin Klein (u/w) model - enough said.To continue with the story: Christian works in a restaurant owned by the elegant Lila (Jacqueline Bisset, who gets some of the best lines in the movie). When the pious Mormon guys move into his neighborhood, Christian accepts a bet from his friends that he will succeed in bedding one of the missionaries. Christian's target is Aaron and he tries to seduce Aaron but ends up falling hard for the guy instead. Aaron is a closeted gay - his church prohibits homosexuality and Aaron tries to devote his mind, soul and body to God and prayers, but meeting Christian just wreaks havoc with all his beliefs and efforts. When he is caught kissing Christian, Aaron is sent home in 'disgrace'. Christian chases after him, confesses his love and what follows after that is a most passionate love scene...Some of my favorite scenes:1) everytime A and C kiss.2) their love scene which begins with Aaron making the first move, pinning Christian against the wall and kissing him passionately...3) the heartbreaking scene in Aaron's home in Idaho after he is sent home. His disappointed mother who could not forgive him for being gay, asking him, ""Is Christian the one?"". Aaron, his eyes sad and far-away but his face radiant with joy at the mention of his lover's name, smiles and nods his head. His mother (screaming now): ""What did he do to you?!"" Aaron (still smiling and radiant): ""He loved me.""I love this film so much I've even done some ""movie-making"" of my own on the characters e.g.:1) will their relationship last? Yes! Christian will never let go of Aaron because there's not a chance he'll meet someone as beautiful (inside and out) as Aaron again. Both characters are good at heart and I can't see them ever hurting each other.2) It's difficult to imagine anyone hurting someone as good and beautiful as Aaron. But then his family did. Parents are always harder on their children, I guess.I was pleasantly surprised to find a copy of the novel (based on the screenplay) in my local bookstore as the movie is not released in our theatres (I had to get the DVD). Of course, I snapped it up immediately! Read the novel - there're extra scenes to enjoy and it tells you the exact moment Christian falls in love with Aaron.DVD, book - get both.

Knowing how campy and ""gay"" he can be, I judged this movie not by its merit, but by association.  Shallow of me, but in Aaron (our Mormon protagonist) sort of way.  I did buy it, however, and it's not money wasted.  I guess I have to re-evaluate my twin brother.The movie started with this guy named Christian, who was your campy, sex-driven, party-going pretty boy.  He lured a straight guy into bed with him..., and he wore jock strap under his skin-tight hot pants with lace enclosure (details count...).  He is everything scandalous, and he flames.Later, we are introduced with this guy who is straight laced (on his shoes) and very religious.  What does this guy and that flamboyant gay paradigm have in common?  Nothing, except they are both gay.They eventually fell in love with each other.That's the movie's premise.  Very cute.  Never would work in real life (and I am still not convinced it would).  However, it's how a movie unfolds that's central to the success of any movie.  In term of structure, it has a fluffy happy opening, but ends with something that sinks one's heart.  In a sense, it's a nice road trip of the heart.The cast includes Steve Sandvoss (plays Aaron, our Mormon boy) and Wesley Ramsey (plays Chris, our party boy).  Wesley Ramsey really looks more Ryan Renolds than Will from Will and Grace, which is how the DVD cover art was able to deceive me.  In any case, the Mormon boy, in my opinion, looks much better on my eyes.  The smile is convincingly innocent, pure and adorable.  You can almost ignore the fact he has a pretty good body to boost.Acting wise, Sandvoss also triumphed in that department (where did they find this guy?).  We also have Joseph Gordon-Levitt (of Third Rock from the Sun fame), who was also excellent (but his lines was someone not very plausible, and his character lacked dimension; faults went to the script, not him).  I have a feeling if the script were better, some of the characters would be more interesting.  Instead, they were standard issues of cliche characters.  The restaurant owner's characterization and/or acting was particularly bad.I don't know why the movie was shot in 60 frames/sec or some such.  A standard 24 frames/sec would give it a more movie-like experience, instead of that home-made movie feel.  It's not shot by a hand-held video cam (it was shot in digital).  It does have some editing that's borderline on good amateur and mainstream professional quality.  Nevertheless, the choice of reel was just... distracting.The story did flow.  If I were to nitpick, it's really that I don't think Mormon boy's punishment by his church was cruel enough.  Realistically, in his situation, everything should tumble down on him.  I read it somewhere, in order to make a good tragedy, you'd have to be a sadist.  Everything terrible must fall on the good character, and I did not see that happened on our cute and innocent Aaron.  When his mother finally slapped him I felt, ""it's about time.""BTW, that scene was very nice.  I think the director failed to shot the reaction shot of Aaron's face when he was slapped.  I think that's the best performance coming from Sandvoss in this movie.  It reminded me of someone I love dearly.  That's a genuine cry of a man who could no longer cover up his true feeling.Anyways, one star for the movie itself, the rest of the three stars go to Steve Sandvoss.  This movie will not pull it off if it wasn't saved by our absolutely adorable actor and his performance.",4,Gay but not (overly) campy,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,3741,"['still', 'campy', 'moments', 'dialog', 'problems', '99', '%', 'made-for-gay', 'movies', 'major', 'improvement', 'most', 'gay', 'sexploitation/soft', 'porn', 'movies.This', 'movie', 'was', 'suggested', 'twin', 'brother', 'who', 'not', 'biologically', 'related', 'Knowing', 'how', 'campy', 'gay', 'can', 'be', 'judged', 'movie', 'not', 'merit', 'association', 'Shallow', 'Aaron', 'Mormon', 'protagonist', 'sort', 'way', 'did', 'buy', 'however', 'not', 'money', 'wasted', 'guess', 'have', 're-evaluate', 'twin', 'brother.The', 'movie', 'started', 'guy', 'named', 'Christian', 'who', 'was', 'campy', 'sex-driven', 'party-going', 'pretty', 'boy', 'lured', 'straight', 'guy', 'bed', 'wore', 'jock', 'strap', 'skin-tight', 'hot', 'pants', 'lace', 'enclosure', 'details', 'count', 'everything', 'scandalous', 'flames.Later', 'are', 'introduced', 'guy', 'who', 'straight', 'laced', 'shoes', 'very', 'religious', 'What', 'guy', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'paradigm', 'have', 'common', 'Nothing', 'are', 'gay.They', 'eventually', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'premise', 'Very', 'cute', 'Never', 'would', 'work', 'real', 'life', 'am', 'still', 'not', 'convinced', 'would', 'However', 'how', 'movie', 'central', 'success', 'movie', 'term', 'structure', 'fluffy', 'happy', 'opening', 'something', 'one', 'heart', 'sense', 'nice', 'road', 'trip', 'heart.The', 'cast', 'Steve', 'Sandvoss', 'Aaron', 'Mormon', 'boy', 'Wesley', 'Ramsey', 'Chris', 'party', 'boy', 'Wesley', 'Ramsey', 'really', 'more', 'Ryan', 'Renolds', 'Will', 'Will', 'Grace', 'how', 'DVD', 'cover', 'art', 'was', 'able', 'deceive', 'case', 'Mormon', 'boy', 'opinion', 'much', 'better', 'eyes', 'smile', 'convincingly', 'innocent', 'pure', 'adorable', 'can', 'almost', 'ignore', 'fact', 'pretty', 'good', 'body', 'boost.Acting', 'wise', 'Sandvoss', 'also', 'triumphed', 'department', 'where', 'did', 'find', 'guy', 'also', 'have', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'fame', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'lines', 'was', 'someone', 'not', 'very', 'plausible', 'character', 'lacked', 'dimension', 'faults', 'went', 'script', 'not', 'have', 'feeling', 'script', 'were', 'better', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'Instead', 'were', 'standard', 'issues', 'cliche', 'characters', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'characterization', 'acting', 'was', 'particularly', 'bad.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', '60', 'frames/sec', 'such', 'standard', '24', 'frames/sec', 'would', 'give', 'more', 'movie-like', 'experience', 'instead', 'home-made', 'movie', 'feel', 'not', 'shot', 'hand-held', 'video', 'cam', 'was', 'shot', 'digital', 'have', 'editing', 'borderline', 'good', 'amateur', 'mainstream', 'professional', 'quality', 'Nevertheless', 'choice', 'reel', 'was', 'just', 'distracting.The', 'story', 'did', 'flow', 'were', 'nitpick', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Mormon', 'boy', 'punishment', 'church', 'was', 'cruel', 'enough', 'Realistically', 'situation', 'everything', 'should', 'tumble', 'down', 'read', 'somewhere', 'order', 'make', 'good', 'tragedy', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'sadist', 'Everything', 'terrible', 'must', 'fall', 'good', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'happened', 'cute', 'innocent', 'Aaron', 'When', 'mother', 'finally', 'slapped', 'felt', 'time', 'BTW', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'think', 'director', 'failed', 'shot', 'reaction', 'shot', 'Aaron', 'face', 'when', 'was', 'slapped', 'think', 'best', 'performance', 'coming', 'Sandvoss', 'movie', 'reminded', 'someone', 'love', 'dearly', 'genuine', 'cry', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'cover', 'up', 'true', 'feeling.Anyways', 'one', 'star', 'movie', 'rest', 'three', 'stars', 'go', 'Steve', 'Sandvoss', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'pull', 'off', 'was', ""n't"", 'saved', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'actor', 'performance']",N/A

835040,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B0002I84JO,barry,"[6, 6]",I think it is awesome that TLA is finally releasing some of their better releases on blu ray.  There are a lot of subpar gay films out there and LATTER DAYS has always shown itself as a heartfelt film that deals with real situations with compassion and honesty.  The main story is about what a Mormon missionary encounters when he is discovered to be gay and falls in love.  But the film also deals with AIDS and the different ways gay people choose to live their lives.  Many of the characters here go on definite soul searching journeys.  And the film is very succesful.But if you are reading this you probably already are a fan of this film and want to know how it looks on blu ray.  Blu ray when done well can make a film a whole new experience and that is what happens here.  The video quality far surpasses that on the dvd with colors that are vibrant and pop and flesh tones that are realistic and true.  Most importantly the picture is vivid and detail is crisp.  The picture truly has a clarity that far surpasses the dvd.  And the upgraded Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track is also excellent.  The film is basically dialogue driven and for the most part it is always clear and present.  Just a few lines of talk fall below the radar.  Soundtrack music blends in perfectly and the whole blu ray package mixes for a great viewing experience.Highly recommend a purchase of this film and if you are a true fan owning the dvd it is worth double dipping.  The film looks so much better in blu ray.

835041,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B0002I84JO,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[8, 10]","While Latter Days is a moving breakthrough of a film, its flaws can't be ignored. As many have already pointed out, this truly touching story of love lost then found, rests on some shaky pillars. But however they might shake, the film's message and meaning remain strong to the end.The story starts off great as young Mormon missionary, Aaron Davis (Steve Sandvoss), arrives to the City of Angels and immediately glances his angel (as yet unknown to him) through a taxi-window.  Aaron and his rough and ready missionaries take to their bikes and begin proselytizing.  It turns out that Aaron's angel is his next-door neighbor, Christian, (Wes Ramsey).  Chris is a party boy who brags of his conquests between waiting tables at the local swank joint with his men&aacute;ge of fellow urban hipsters,  roommate-friend Julie (Rebekah Jordan) who moonlights as a club singer, budding actress Traci (Amber Benson) and HIV+ sassy black guy, Andrew(well-acted by Khary Payton).  They put Christian up to a new challenge.  Can he bed his new straight-laced neighbor?As the challenge begins, Latter Days feels like a soap opera brought to the big screen.  Scene and line are as shallow as the SoCal environment Cox does his best to bring to life.  Everybody is so primped and perfect.  Chris and his buddies chatter up the same old theme: sex.Things start to get serious as Aaron and Chris get a little closer.  First, it`s a mission call to Chris and Julie, then its the laundry room and a super-contrived stunt where Chris fakes an injury and Aaron nurses the near naked Chris. You can't believe this could ever happen to anybody.  Too forced, too smutzy, but nevertheless, the scene works.  The ball of attraction starts to roll and neither Chris nor Aaron can stop it.While attending to Chris's 'wounds,' Aaron awkwardly confesses his attraction to Chris and to men in general, devulging his 'secret' as he calls it.  He chastises Chris for just wanting to bed him and for treating him like some backwood cretin.  Sandvoss's acting here is a bit amatuerish, but we believe him precisely because this is just how a closeted and sheltered missionary from Pocatello would act.  On the other end, Wes Ramsey plays Chris perfectly: witty, coy, the perfect boy-toy who hides his vulnerability behind his charm and looks.After his chastisement, Chris aims to prove that he isn`t so shallow after all and begins to volunteer for the local 'meals on wheels,' taking food to an home-bound AIDS patient played by Erik Palladino.  Erik's character is one of the few shiny spots among the supporting cast--the other being Khary Payton's campy waiter.  Acidic and wounded at the same time, he tries to teach Chris a thing or two about the dead-end road of beauty for beauty's sake.  His one liners touch and burn at the same time.The film's crescendo comes with Chris and Aaron's first kiss, spoiled by Aaron's fellow missionaries.  Aaron is promptly sent home for excommunication and humiliation.  While Cox certainly seems to have an axe to grind with the Church of Latter Day Saints, I found the scenes of excommunication and later 'treatment' believable if a bit glossed-over (as one critic said correctly, like a Trent Raznor clip).  Yet, the film's dramatic high point comes when Aaron clashes with his mom about 'being that way.' Both Sandvoss and Mary Kay Place (Aaron`s mother) create an intense and believable scene of mother-son confrontation.  By this time, the film`s flaws seem insignificant  as Aaron`s agony and emotional turmoil pull you in deeper.Despite all its cut-out characters, cheesy dialogues and made-up situations, Latter Days achieves its goal by the end.  It moves you.  And while rolling eyes at its faux pas, you`ll find yourself wiping away the tears as well.  Yes, the bodies are too perfect, the dialogue too Friends-ish and the whole thing too Californicated, but as Chris realizes what he has lost, the film gains an unexpected gravity.

835047,A14QAT1XDSCLEO,B0002I84JO,Bitcetc,"[23, 27]","With no preconceptions---- no knowledge, actually --- of this movie before I saw it, I found Latter Days to be much better than it had to be, and more universal than a romance about two very different gay men falling in love (""opposites attract"" says the tag line) might appear to a general audience.The depth of the cast is jaw-dropping: Jacqueline Bisset, Mary Kay Place, Amber Benson (recognizable from her role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Erik Pallidino (familiar to ER viewers as Dr. Malucci), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (from Third Rock from the Sun) and Michael Moriarity in supporting roles.Obviously, this movie is a ""labor of love"". And I mean that in every sense of the phrase. This ""course of true love never did run smooth"" for these two characters, but this is a tale of true love laboring to realize itself.Four Mormon missionaries who move to his Los Angeles apartment block represent a challenge to a licentious and gorgeous gay hedonist, ironically named Christian (played by Wesley A. Ramsey). He makes a bet with his fellow waiters to seduce one of the four. The Elder named Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) seems the most receptive. There is no doubt that Christian is attracted to him--- even perhaps beyond his usual flavor-of-this-sixty-seconds attraction.Aaron is miserable in his fascination with Christian: it confirms what he has known about himself and resisted, but it represents sin beyond forgiveness or understanding in his missionary world. It represents the end of life as he has known it. Naive and wise at the same time, he tells Christian that relationships have meaning, must have meaning beyond a handshake. Aaron tells Lila (Jacqueline Bisset), the restaurant owner who employs Christian, that even if we can't see the connection between the dots, there is meaning and connection from God's view. Aaron can't give up that belief even when his faith is stripped from him.Meaning in relationships is a new concept to Christian, our pilgrim in this movie. Aaron's view of him as shallow shocks him, and so Aaron has already made a difference in Christian's life which pushes the bet very far down in his priorities, almost out of his consciousness.  Finding any serious chord in himself is a disturbing surprise to him, and stimulates his growth into something more than a pretty party animal.The script begins with ribald wit, and might have maintained that wit throughout with a bit more production money and time for a few more re-writes. The transitions become a little rougher as the movie goes on. There are some dramatic sequences (especially one significant plot point between the two main characters outside in the snow at the Salt Lake City airport) quite obviously awkward, which in a bigger budget production, would probably have been re-shot.But this movie's profound and universal messages are about prejudices, about love, and about miracles. The movie has its agenda: just as it is very controversial in its depiction of the Church of Latter Day Saints as grotesquely intolerant, it will shock some with its fairly graphic depiction of homosexual sex. It is not a movie which is gentle with everyone's sensibilities.The story briefly reminded me of Longfellow's ""Evangeline"", where the lovers worked so hard to find each other again, and also more tellingly of an excellent book about a deeply moving love story between two gay men, my introduction to the idea of real romantic love between men: The Charioteer by Mary Renault. Very much as that book enlightened mine and my friends' preconceived notions about the depth of emotions possible between homosexual men, this movie has something universally applicable to say about love's fostering our growth into the people we are meant to be.My companion said ""another small-but-smart movie not to be heard of at next year's Academy Awards"", but it is entirely possible this one may find a nomination in a musical category. The score was good, and some of the songs really first-rate. Rebekah Johnson---aka Rebekah Jordan---, playing Christian's roommate Julie, gave those songs a real chance to be memorable.",3,Praying and Playing: Love with a Proper Stranger,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,4107,"['preconceptions', 'knowledge', 'actually', 'movie', 'saw', 'found', 'Latter', 'Days', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'be', 'more', 'universal', 'romance', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'gay', 'men', 'falling', 'love', 'attract', 'tag', 'line', 'might', 'appear', 'general', 'audience.The', 'depth', 'cast', 'jaw-dropping', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'recognizable', 'role', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Erik', 'Pallidino', 'familiar', 'ER', 'viewers', 'Dr.', 'Malucci', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'Michael', 'Moriarity', 'supporting', 'roles.Obviously', 'movie', 'labor', 'love', 'mean', 'sense', 'phrase', 'course', 'true', 'love', 'never', 'did', 'run', 'smooth', 'two', 'characters', 'tale', 'true', 'love', 'laboring', 'realize', 'itself.Four', 'Mormon', 'missionaries', 'who', 'move', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'apartment', 'block', 'represent', 'challenge', 'licentious', 'gorgeous', 'gay', 'hedonist', 'ironically', 'named', 'Christian', 'played', 'Wesley', 'A.', 'Ramsey', 'bet', 'fellow', 'waiters', 'seduce', 'one', 'four', 'Elder', 'named', 'Aaron', 'played', 'Steve', 'Sandvoss', 'most', 'receptive', 'doubt', 'Christian', 'attracted', 'even', 'perhaps', 'usual', 'flavor-of-this-sixty-seconds', 'attraction.Aaron', 'miserable', 'fascination', 'Christian', 'what', 'known', 'resisted', 'sin', 'forgiveness', 'understanding', 'missionary', 'world', 'end', 'life', 'known', 'Naive', 'wise', 'same', 'time', 'Christian', 'relationships', 'have', 'meaning', 'must', 'have', 'meaning', 'handshake', 'Aaron', 'Lila', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'who', 'Christian', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'connection', 'dots', 'meaning', 'connection', 'God', 'view', 'Aaron', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'belief', 'even', 'when', 'faith', 'stripped', 'him.Meaning', 'relationships', 'new', 'concept', 'Christian', 'pilgrim', 'movie', 'Aaron', 'view', 'shallow', 'shocks', 'so', 'Aaron', 'already', 'made', 'difference', 'Christian', 'life', 'bet', 'very', 'far', 'down', 'priorities', 'almost', 'consciousness', 'Finding', 'serious', 'chord', 'disturbing', 'surprise', 'growth', 'something', 'more', 'pretty', 'party', 'animal.The', 'script', 'ribald', 'wit', 'might', 'have', 'maintained', 'wit', 'bit', 'more', 'production', 'money', 'time', 'few', 'more', 're-writes', 'transitions', 'become', 'little', 'rougher', 'movie', 'are', 'dramatic', 'sequences', 'especially', 'one', 'significant', 'plot', 'point', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'snow', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'airport', 'quite', 'obviously', 'awkward', 'bigger', 'budget', 'production', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 're-shot.But', 'movie', 'profound', 'universal', 'messages', 'are', 'prejudices', 'about', 'love', 'miracles', 'movie', 'agenda', 'just', 'very', 'controversial', 'depiction', 'Church', 'Latter', 'Day', 'Saints', 'grotesquely', 'intolerant', 'will', 'shock', 'fairly', 'graphic', 'depiction', 'homosexual', 'sex', 'not', 'movie', 'gentle', 'everyone', 'sensibilities.The', 'story', 'briefly', 'reminded', 'Longfellow', 'Evangeline', 'where', 'lovers', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'other', 'again', 'also', 'more', 'tellingly', 'excellent', 'book', 'deeply', 'moving', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'introduction', 'idea', 'real', 'romantic', 'love', 'men', 'Charioteer', 'Mary', 'Renault', 'Very', 'much', 'book', 'enlightened', 'mine', 'friends', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'depth', 'emotions', 'possible', 'homosexual', 'men', 'movie', 'something', 'universally', 'applicable', 'say', 'love', 'fostering', 'growth', 'people', 'are', 'meant', 'be.My', 'companion', 'said', 'small-but-smart', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'heard', 'next', 'year', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'entirely', 'possible', 'one', 'may', 'find', 'nomination', 'musical', 'category', 'score', 'was', 'good', 'songs', 'really', 'first-rate', 'Rebekah', 'Johnson', '-aka', 'Rebekah', 'Jordan', 'playing', 'Christian', 'roommate', 'Julie', 'gave', 'songs', 'real', 'chance', 'be', 'memorable']",N/A

835050,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,B0002I84JO,Bruce G. Taylor,"[0, 0]","This review may contain a few spoilers:As independent films of this type go, this is pretty good one albeit painted with slightly broad strokes.  The cast is generally good, although  I didn't for a second believe Jacqueline Bisset's crying scene in front of the hospital.  The most convincing performance, for me,  was Khary Payton's sardonic portrayal of the young man stricken with AIDS.  Steve Sandvoss' (Aaron) facial expressions and dialog delivery at times seem rather forced and artificial, but you do end up routing for him.  The scene involving Aaron's penance and ""conversion treatment"" is a little muddled -- I was not completely sure on first viewing what was being done to whom.  The scene of Aaron's attempting suicide was successfully conveyed without its being overly graphic.  An actor of the caliber of Joseph Gordon-Levitt was simply wasted in this picture.  He might have had personal reasons for wanting to contribute to it.  It couldn't have been for whatever salary he received and  I place him far above this film.If I had been directing this, I would not have had Wes Ramsey (Christian) drop his tray of dishes in such melodramatic surprise upon seeing Aaron before him in the final scene.  Much more affecting, I think,  would have been for him in a medium/close shot, frozen in surprise with his jaw then slowly dropping in a mixture of both astonishment and pleasure with the camera then dollying back to include Sandvoss facing him.  That moment should have been more subtly touching for the audience.  One of those moments when more power could have been conveyed by doing less.

835054,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0002I84JO,C. B Collins Jr.,"[8, 9]","I found Latter Days to be a sexy and witty comedy with an insightful message about the human struggle to discover and develop our identity.The story is far more than a boy-meets-boy gay coming-out drama. I felt the story was about how we all both discover our identity and also develop that identity.Aaron, the Mormon missionary, discovers and uncovers his homosexual feelings and all his barriers come down in his first act of love making with Christian in a airport hotel. Yet, even after this intense night of love and intimacy, he must continue to discover his identity by returning to his parent's home in Iowa and reconcil the Mormon identity that he has constructed for 22 years.  A more superficial story line would have had Aaron ""realize"" he was gay after making love to Christian and they would have lived happy ever after.  Cox is a comic writer but he is not formulaic. Instead, Aaron must continue to struggle to build his identity. He had to leave Christian asleep in bed to confront his unfinished business. He would have been another wounded urban gay refugee had he not gone home to face his family and their beliefs.Christian follows a similar pattern. He makes a bet to seduce a Mormon boy but finds that he is challenged to move out of himself and out of his own ego to build his own character and identity. In the first attempt by Christian to seduce Aaron, he finds that he has uncovered Aaron's secret but is confronted with Aaron's comment: ""You are a walking, talking, marshmallow peep."" Aaron can not make love to Christian at this point, not because Christian is not beautiful (which he is) but because Aaron has been taught to seek meaning and not appearance. Christian begins to seek some meaning in his life beside night-clubs and tricks, through volunteer work at an AIDS Service Organization, and thus begins to create of himself the man that Aaron can love.There is some fine acting in the film. Wes Ramsey and Steve Sandvoss are great. Mary Kay Place is exceptional as Steve's distressed mother.But overall, it was the fact that this film showed two young men in self discovery, moving into the ""self"" (Aaron) and moving out of the ""ego"" (Christian) that made them worthy partners for each other that moved this little film into the great category.",5,Two pilgrims meet on their journeys,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,2283,"['found', 'Latter', 'Days', 'be', 'sexy', 'witty', 'comedy', 'insightful', 'message', 'human', 'struggle', 'discover', 'develop', 'identity.The', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'boy-meets-boy', 'gay', 'coming-out', 'drama', 'felt', 'story', 'was', 'how', 'discover', 'identity', 'also', 'develop', 'identity.Aaron', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'discovers', 'uncovers', 'homosexual', 'feelings', 'barriers', 'come', 'down', 'first', 'act', 'love', 'making', 'Christian', 'airport', 'hotel', 'even', 'intense', 'night', 'love', 'intimacy', 'must', 'continue', 'discover', 'identity', 'returning', 'parent', 'home', 'Iowa', 'reconcil', 'Mormon', 'identity', 'constructed', '22', 'years', 'more', 'superficial', 'story', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'Aaron', 'realize', 'was', 'gay', 'making', 'love', 'Christian', 'would', 'have', 'lived', 'happy', 'ever', 'Cox', 'comic', 'writer', 'not', 'formulaic', 'Instead', 'Aaron', 'must', 'continue', 'struggle', 'build', 'identity', 'had', 'leave', 'Christian', 'asleep', 'bed', 'confront', 'unfinished', 'business', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wounded', 'urban', 'gay', 'refugee', 'had', 'not', 'gone', 'home', 'face', 'family', 'beliefs.Christian', 'similar', 'pattern', 'bet', 'seduce', 'Mormon', 'boy', 'challenged', 'move', 'own', 'ego', 'build', 'own', 'character', 'identity', 'first', 'attempt', 'Christian', 'seduce', 'Aaron', 'uncovered', 'Aaron', 'secret', 'confronted', 'Aaron', 'comment', 'are', 'walking', 'talking', 'marshmallow', 'peep', 'Aaron', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'love', 'Christian', 'point', 'not', 'Christian', 'not', 'beautiful', 'Aaron', 'been', 'taught', 'seek', 'meaning', 'not', 'appearance', 'Christian', 'seek', 'meaning', 'life', 'night-clubs', 'tricks', 'volunteer', 'work', 'AIDS', 'Service', 'Organization', 'thus', 'begins', 'create', 'man', 'Aaron', 'can', 'love.There', 'fine', 'acting', 'film', 'Wes', 'Ramsey', 'Steve', 'Sandvoss', 'are', 'great', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'exceptional', 'Steve', 'distressed', 'mother.But', 'overall', 'was', 'fact', 'film', 'showed', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'self', 'discovery', 'moving', 'self', 'Aaron', 'moving', 'ego', 'Christian', 'made', 'worthy', 'partners', 'other', 'moved', 'little', 'film', 'great', 'category']",N/A

But ""Latter Days"" falls very far short of both categories in favor of religion bashing and a plot line  that manages to be both predictable and unbelievable at the same time (don't get me wrong here, I'm no Mormon; it would ALSO be nice to see a movie where religious people actually use the teachings of the Bible to learn about themselves and others they might not have once found acceptable or lovable.  Aw heck,  it would be nice in life).  THE thing that makes drama work, no matter the conflict (man against man, man against himself, man against nature, etc) is that the audience cares what happens to the protagonist.  Neither of the two main characters, Christian or Aaron, are all that likeable nor could I muster any interest in their fates.

Now, the book is simply an adaptation of the screen-play for this film, but I knew I'd buy it and I wouldn't read it if I saw the movie first. I think reading the book I got my own idea of how the characters should be.. and I think the movie almost perfectly captured them...The story was sweet, and original.. most of the gay cinema that comes out today is infested with drugs, stereotypes and AIDS. Though this movie has all of these elements to a degree... they are not major, overpowering, or entirely relevant points in the movie... Despite the fact that these are very important issues in society.. sometimes we just need a good romantic movie. When I heard that the same person who wrote ""Latter Days"" also wrote ""Sweet Home Alabama"" I knew it'd be just that.This movie also touches on some original issues of Homosexuality vs. Faith... which is discussed more and more every day, but you don't see it much in film. The only other movie which I feel even touched on this subject was ""Angels in America"" and even then it was only a side story, and a bit of a downer....The story contained in ""Latter Days"" is refreshing, light, and makes you all weak inside.The performances weren't bad, however.. I will say I pictured Christian to be completely different.. not as wormy and twinky, for someone who spends alot of time at the gym.. I also imagined Lila to be a bit more of a bitch and a bit less of a mother figure. Ms Bissette turned in a stiff performance, and at times a bit unbelievable (and they say Madonna's a bad actress). The girl who plays Julie (Christian's Roommate and Bestfriend) is also like someone they pulled straight from a high school... devoid of talent.I didn't expect Oscar performances with big names from a low-budget film, but I felt these were valid points to be discussed.Mary Kay Place (who was also in Sweet Home Alabama) turns in a decent job as a Mormon mother...Wes Ramsey, who plays Christian, wasn't bad.. but you could tell he knew he was on camera... but what really matters is that you could tell he was having fun, which made his performance just as enjoyable to watch as he was enjoying performing..the guy who plaid ""Keith"" and the one who plays ""Andrew"" were Great.. no complaints there, they did a great job.. but Steve Sandvoss, who plays Elder Davis, does a fantastic job and stands out among the rest in his premire performance. I hope to continue seeing him in future films.. gay or straight.On the whole, I think anyone can enjoy this film for its romance, for its message and simply for the enjoyment..  as long as the whole ""Gay thing"" doesn't bother them.As far as I'm concerned.. this is on the top part of the short list of ""MUST OWN MOVIES FOR GAY MEN""if you liked ""All Over the Guy,"" ""Trick,"" or ""Angels in America,"" you'll LOVE ""Latter Days"" because it's a nice combination of all of the above.",4,Almost Perfect,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,2959,"['heard', 'movie', 'several', 'other', 'sources', 'forced', 'read', 'book', 'version', 'first', 'Now', 'book', 'simply', 'adaptation', 'screen-play', 'film', 'knew', ""'d"", 'buy', 'would', ""n't"", 'read', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'think', 'reading', 'book', 'got', 'own', 'idea', 'how', 'characters', 'should', 'be..', 'think', 'movie', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'story', 'was', 'sweet', 'most', 'gay', 'cinema', 'out', 'today', 'infested', 'drugs', 'stereotypes', 'AIDS', 'movie', 'elements', 'degree', 'are', 'not', 'major', 'overpowering', 'entirely', 'relevant', 'points', 'movie', 'fact', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'issues', 'society..', 'sometimes', 'just', 'need', 'good', 'romantic', 'movie', 'When', 'heard', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'wrote', 'Latter', 'Days', 'also', 'wrote', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'knew', ""'d"", 'be', 'just', 'that.This', 'movie', 'also', 'original', 'issues', 'Homosexuality', 'vs', 'Faith', 'discussed', 'more', 'more', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'film', 'only', 'other', 'movie', 'feel', 'even', 'touched', 'subject', 'was', 'Angels', 'America', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'only', 'side', 'story', 'bit', 'downer', '.The', 'story', 'contained', 'Latter', 'Days', 'refreshing', 'light', 'weak', 'inside.The', 'performances', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'however..', 'will', 'say', 'pictured', 'Christian', 'be', 'completely', 'different..', 'not', 'wormy', 'twinky', 'someone', 'who', 'alot', 'time', 'gym..', 'also', 'imagined', 'Lila', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'bitch', 'bit', 'less', 'mother', 'figure', 'Ms', 'Bissette', 'turned', 'stiff', 'performance', 'times', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'say', 'Madonna', 'bad', 'actress', 'girl', 'who', 'Julie', 'Christian', 'Roommate', 'Bestfriend', 'also', 'someone', 'pulled', 'straight', 'high', 'school', 'devoid', 'talent.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Oscar', 'performances', 'big', 'names', 'low-budget', 'film', 'felt', 'were', 'valid', 'points', 'be', 'discussed.Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'decent', 'job', 'Mormon', 'mother', 'Wes', 'Ramsey', 'who', 'Christian', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad..', 'could', 'tell', 'knew', 'was', 'camera', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'made', 'performance', 'just', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'was', 'enjoying', 'performing..the', 'guy', 'who', 'Keith', 'one', 'who', 'Andrew', 'were', 'Great..', 'complaints', 'there', 'did', 'great', 'job..', 'Steve', 'Sandvoss', 'who', 'Elder', 'Davis', 'fantastic', 'job', 'out', 'rest', 'premire', 'performance', 'hope', 'continue', 'seeing', 'future', 'films..', 'gay', 'straight.On', 'whole', 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film', 'romance', 'message', 'simply', 'enjoyment..', 'as', 'long', 'whole', 'Gay', 'thing', ""n't"", 'bother', 'them.As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned..', 'top', 'part', 'short', 'list', 'MUST', 'OWN', 'MOVIES', 'FOR', 'GAY', 'MEN', 'liked', 'Guy', 'Trick', 'Angels', 'America', ""'ll"", 'LOVE', 'Latter', 'Days', 'nice', 'combination', 'above']",N/A

Personally I think it's tacky, even when the religion in question is one I do not agree with, such as mormonism. In spite of this, this film is a must-see! I totally fell in love with Steve Sandvoss in ""Latter Days"". The fresh innocence and wisdom of the young character he portrays, adds to this film a whole new realm of thought provoking grandeur and meaning. Wes Ramsey plays the part of Christian, a young nelly boy wholly engulfed in the gay lifestyle and going from one one-night-stand to another, viewing his sex life as one long fun adventure with no need for meaning. Aaron (Sandvoss) is living a totally different life as a Mormon Missionary, rooted deep in his beliefs in God and eternal life. Through his faithfulness to his beliefs, he has grown in wisdom that everything in life has a purpose and is not to be taken for granted. On a bet, Christian begans to try seducing Aaron but gets more than he bargains for. In his quest to seduce Aaron, he becomes quite attracted to him, but Aarons outlook on life and harsh criticism for Christians happy-go-lucky lifestyle prompts him to re-examine the whole purpose for his life. Aaron is on the verge of having his first sexual experience with Christian. He is battling between giving in to desire and holding to his beliefs. Christian tells hims not to worry, it doesn't have to mean anything, just a little fun between friends. Aaron is not amused at the suggestion and is turned off by it. ""My first time would be nothing more to you than just a little fun?"" Suddenly it becomes a question of just whom might be converting whom. The life of both characters must change because of their having met one another. Picture and sound quality are great, as is the casting for this movie. The acting is superb and you will certainly find yourself captivated as you watch to see where the story will end. There is one unsettling implication that one's beliefs can be cast off and totally changed through a romp in the hay, so to speak, but the story line takes it far beyond to a conclusion that must meet somewhere in the middle for these two totally opposite characters.

CJ Cox seems to have more talent for writing lyrics and wrote many of the songs for the very inspiring soundtrack but the plot suffers some sporadic but severe deficits;  The romance between the two main characters moves too fast to be believable as truly intimate.  There are also way too many gay cliches which unfortunately detract from the integrity of the film. Some of the dialogue is also just plain cheesy however there are a few moments of humor to make you forget the utterly ridiculous parts of the script.Steve Sandvoss shines in his role as does Wes Ramsey.

""Latter Days"" is a movie about a timely subject for gay people of all walks of life---their spirituality, the way their church perceives their lifestyle and the need for spiritual and romantic love.  The story centers about two young men who couldn't be more different.  Aaron is a young Mormon missionary, who is secretly gay but has his desires ignited by the free spirited (maybe a little TOO free spirited!) Christian, an openly gay man who has sex as often as he changes his underwear.  Fate brings the two men together and a change begins to take place in both men, one yearning for the romantic love he has denied himself, the other realizing that there is more to life than falling in and out of a strangers bed every night.  The repurcussions are felt hardest by Aaron, who must deal with his religious family's repulsion to his sexual awakening and their determination to cure him of his ""wicked acts against God"".Though all the actors do well in their roles, it is Steve Sandvoss who stands out.  He plays Elder Davis, an naive, good hearted young man, with a strong moral center--portraying a young man that most of us can relate to, dealing with a dilemma that effects every facet of his life.  Jacqueline Bisset plays Lila, a motherly figure to the young group of friends working in her restaurant and Joseph Devine-Levitt (Tommy of television's Third Rock From the Sun) as a fellow missionary.  Eric Palladino (of ER)takes on the role of a man stricken with AIDS that befriends Christian.The ending is a little too convienent but it is nice to see a gay love story with a positive and upbeat ending.

Their own innocence of life, where everything new and unknow is so exciting that it really comes through. These two young men really put their hearts into their performances. I really don't think anybody else could have pulled it off. I just wonder how fantastic this could have truly been with a huge budget.Anybody who gave this movie one star and/or berated the movie is either still in complete denial of their sexual identity or has an agenda against good, honest gay films that tug at the heart.

Jay Cox makes a valiant attempt at creating a gay-oriented film for a mainstream audience, but he pads his story with so many contrivances that don't allow the film to resonate as it should as a thoughtful treatise on the hostile incompatibility between organized religion and homosexuality. The story focuses on the ironically named Christian, a standard-issue WeHo party-boy who waits tables at a fancy LA eatery, and Aaron, a fresh-faced Mormon missionary, one of four uptight, white-collared boys who plant themselves next door to Christian to spread the word of their religion. This sitcom-sounding set-up leads to a $50 bet made among the restaurant wait staff to see if Christian can bed Aaron, obviously leading to complications that look anything but promising to either the characters or the viewer.Fortunately, the film improves marginally once the two get together, even though the evolution of their relationship is inevitable according to the conventions set forth by Cox. What is intriguing at this point is that Aaron's self-acceptance as a gay man is not as automatically liberating as one would expect. Instead, Aaron challenges the narcissistic Christian for his vapidity, and in turn, Christian looks inward as he becomes close to a sardonic AIDS patient. The movie resonates most when it deals directly with the restricted attitudes of the Mormon Church as embodied most viscerally by Aaron's mother and when Christian comes to accept his own lifestyle limitations. However, Cox layers too many coincidences toward the end and eventually disavows his social commentary in favor of a predictable ending.The music, which is actually integral to the plot, is unfortunately the type of irritating LA-based pop that distracts from the drama, in particular, a song performed by Rebekah Jordan (playing fellow waitress Julie) with lyrics courtesy of Christian's Palm Pilot diary. The performances are variable. Wes Ramsey certainly looks the part of Christian, though his stereotypical character doesn't give him much opportunity to provide depth even as his character gets more serious-minded. On the other hand, Steve Sandvoss is surprisingly substantive as Aaron, bringing a lot of conviction to a role that demands a level of naivet' that could be alienating in more cynical hands.In a role directly opposite to the hustler he played in last year's ""Mysterious Skin"", Joseph Gordon-Levitt is disappointingly one-note as Aaron's homophobic colleague; but Mary Kay Place brings searing candor to the role of Aaron's intolerant mother, especially in her blistering kitchen confrontation with Aaron. In a surprising appearance, the still-beautiful Jacqueline Bisset plays the restaurant owner Lila with effortless worldly elan. The film provides true value for its perspective. I only wish Cox trusted the controversial premise more than he does here. The DVD package has deleted scenes; three music videos; less-than-insightful audio commentary from Cox, Ramsey, and Sandvoss; a better making-of featurette; and a short film from Cox, ""Reason Thirteen"".",3,Good Intentions Muddled by Plot Contrivances in Worthy Gay-Oriented Effort,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,3087,"['Director/writer', 'C.', 'Jay', 'Cox', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'creating', 'gay-oriented', 'film', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'contrivances', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'film', 'resonate', 'should', 'thoughtful', 'treatise', 'hostile', 'incompatibility', 'organized', 'religion', 'homosexuality', 'story', 'ironically', 'named', 'Christian', 'standard-issue', 'WeHo', 'party-boy', 'who', 'tables', 'fancy', 'LA', 'eatery', 'Aaron', 'fresh-faced', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'one', 'four', 'uptight', 'white-collared', 'boys', 'who', 'plant', 'next', 'door', 'Christian', 'spread', 'word', 'religion', 'sitcom-sounding', 'set-up', 'leads', '50', 'bet', 'made', 'restaurant', 'wait', 'staff', 'see', 'Christian', 'can', 'bed', 'Aaron', 'obviously', 'leading', 'complications', 'look', 'anything', 'promising', 'either', 'characters', 'viewer.Fortunately', 'film', 'marginally', 'once', 'two', 'get', 'together', 'even', 'evolution', 'relationship', 'inevitable', 'according', 'conventions', 'set', 'forth', 'Cox', 'What', 'intriguing', 'point', 'Aaron', 'self-acceptance', 'gay', 'man', 'not', 'automatically', 'liberating', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Instead', 'Aaron', 'narcissistic', 'Christian', 'vapidity', 'turn', 'Christian', 'inward', 'close', 'sardonic', 'AIDS', 'patient', 'movie', 'most', 'when', 'directly', 'restricted', 'attitudes', 'Mormon', 'Church', 'embodied', 'most', 'viscerally', 'Aaron', 'mother', 'when', 'Christian', 'accept', 'own', 'lifestyle', 'limitations', 'However', 'Cox', 'too', 'many', 'coincidences', 'end', 'eventually', 'social', 'commentary', 'favor', 'predictable', 'ending.The', 'music', 'actually', 'integral', 'plot', 'unfortunately', 'type', 'irritating', 'LA-based', 'pop', 'drama', 'particular', 'song', 'performed', 'Rebekah', 'Jordan', 'playing', 'fellow', 'waitress', 'Julie', 'lyrics', 'courtesy', 'Christian', 'Palm', 'Pilot', 'diary', 'performances', 'are', 'variable', 'Wes', 'Ramsey', 'certainly', 'part', 'Christian', 'stereotypical', 'character', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'opportunity', 'provide', 'depth', 'even', 'character', 'more', 'serious-minded', 'other', 'hand', 'Steve', 'Sandvoss', 'surprisingly', 'substantive', 'Aaron', 'bringing', 'lot', 'conviction', 'role', 'level', 'naivet', 'could', 'be', 'alienating', 'more', 'cynical', 'hands.In', 'role', 'directly', 'opposite', 'hustler', 'played', 'last', 'year', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'disappointingly', 'one-note', 'Aaron', 'homophobic', 'colleague', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'searing', 'candor', 'role', 'Aaron', 'intolerant', 'mother', 'especially', 'blistering', 'kitchen', 'confrontation', 'Aaron', 'surprising', 'appearance', 'still-beautiful', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Lila', 'effortless', 'worldly', 'elan', 'film', 'true', 'value', 'perspective', 'only', 'wish', 'Cox', 'trusted', 'controversial', 'premise', 'more', 'here', 'DVD', 'package', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'three', 'music', 'videos', 'less-than-insightful', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Cox', 'Ramsey', 'Sandvoss', 'better', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'short', 'film', 'Cox', 'Reason', 'Thirteen']",N/A

When Aaron's Mission sends him to LA to spread the word of LDS, he crosses paths with Christian when he moves into the same apartment block with his fellow missionaries. Christian's pals at the restaurant bet he isn't able to seduce one of the Mormon missionaries, and Christian sets his sights on Aaron to earn a easy $50. Christian tries to meet his new neighbors, but they're put off by his openly gay lifestyle. As a pretense, he asks to learn more about the LDS Church, and eventually connects with Aaron over their love of old movies, and the under-rated Ann Margaret. After an accident, Aaron's secret comes exposed. When, instead of shagging him, Aaron accuses Christian of being shallow, Christian begins a process of self-discovery in self-worth, while Aaron attempts to come to terms with his sexuality, with disastrous results.It's a pity that so much vitriol was directed at LDS after the film. Seriously, change the name to Southern Baptist, or even Catholic, and you pretty much have the same experience. This is a brilliant film; one of the first true crossover hits with serious production values, and features phenomenal performances by Sandvoss, Ramsey, Bisset and Place. Sandvoss and Ramsey act their proverbial backsides off (no, Sandvoss isn't really that goofy, and no, Ramsey isn't quite that gay), and Bisset (as Lila, the restaurant owner and Christian's boss) and Place (as Aaron's once-doting mother) turn in unforgettable performances in stellar supporting roles. One scene which stands out in particular: when Aaron and his mother have their ""interaction"" in the kitchen - truly a tough scene to watch, and an impossible one to keep your eyes dry through. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (3rd Rock from the Sun) and Amber Benson (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) turn in strong performances as well, and there's even a damn brilliant original soundtrack, one song of which is performed by Benson. It's not all doom and gloom, though, and there are some truly hilarious lines (one in the opening credits involving Christian and the fellow whose come to take his room-mate on a date, another with Bisset elegantly slagging off a difficult patron, stand out in particular).

He immediately starts in with Aaron, but his plans go awry when he starts to fall for him - and when Aaron tells him what he thinks about the shallow pretty boy trying to seduce him.  Christian is forced to deal with his own views and how others see him, while at the same time, Aaron must face the wrath of his church and his family when his secret is accidentally exposed.Great performances by Wes Ramsey as Christian and Steve Sadnvoss as Aaron.  Jacqueline Bisset and Mary Kay Place also co-star and give fine supporting performances.  For an independent film, the writing is remarkably strong and all the actors give fine performances.  The two main characters make visible changes throughout the film, becoming more human and not so one-dimensional.  Plus, I feel that the handling of the church and its anti-homosexual views were dealt with realistically.The DVD also has 3 deleted scenes (which are quite good), some music videos and featurettes.",4,An enjoyable gay film about love and religion,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,1314,"['Elder', 'Aaron', 'Davis', 'been', 'sent', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'fulfill', 'two', 'years', 'misionary', 'work', 'Mormon', 'Church', 'three', 'other', 'missionaries', 'move', 'apartment', 'complex', 'one', 'neighbors', 'being', 'Christian', 'Markelli', 'young', 'gay', 'handsome', 'waiter', 'bumping', 'Aaron', 'Christian', 'bet', 'co-workers', 'can', 'bed', 'Mormon', 'immediately', 'Aaron', 'plans', 'go', 'awry', 'when', 'fall', 'when', 'Aaron', 'what', 'shallow', 'pretty', 'boy', 'trying', 'seduce', 'Christian', 'forced', 'deal', 'own', 'views', 'how', 'others', 'see', 'same', 'time', 'Aaron', 'must', 'face', 'wrath', 'church', 'family', 'when', 'secret', 'accidentally', 'exposed.Great', 'performances', 'Wes', 'Ramsey', 'Christian', 'Steve', 'Sadnvoss', 'Aaron', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'also', 'co-star', 'give', 'fine', 'supporting', 'performances', 'independent', 'film', 'writing', 'remarkably', 'strong', 'actors', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'make', 'visible', 'changes', 'film', 'becoming', 'more', 'human', 'not', 'so', 'one-dimensional', 'feel', 'handling', 'church', 'anti-homosexual', 'views', 'were', 'dealt', 'realistically.The', 'DVD', 'also', '3', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'music', 'videos', 'featurettes']",N/A

835094,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B0002I84JO,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[3, 8]","So many other Amazon.ca reviews of ""Latter Days"" (T.L.A. Releasing TLAD-084, in the North American edition that I own) have said enough about most aspects of this wonderful film, that I just want to limit my comments to the very genuine realism of the movie's depiction of the Church [i.e. cult] of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The maternal side of my family hails from Utah, my mother having been born in Salt Lake City, and when she reverted to the L.D.S. cult (having been physically tortured as a young child into becoming a member of a Baptist sect by the third of my Mormon grandfather's many, many wives, most of whom were not Mormon, thankfully, though crazed enough in other ways) she dragged my step-father, half-brother, half-sister, and me into the L.D.S. cult along with her.Some folks will think that this motion picture's portrayal of the L.D.S. Mormon cult surely is exaggerated. Not so. This is far from either morbid Mormon-bashing, on the one hand, or from laugh-provoking humour at Mormon expense; of the latter sort of thing, one thinks of the scene in the gay erotic video, ""The Bella Villa"" (a William Higgins International production), in which a persistent doorbell ringer interrupts two naked gay men, the young man at the door resembling at first glance a pesky L.D.S. Mormon missionary (alone, however, not with a companion along to missionise together!), but who turns out to be either a dildoe-delivery dude or door-to-door salesman of such sex toys. The depressing depiction of L.D.S. Mormonism (which requires no overstatement to make its impact) in ""Latter Days"" is right in detail, in mood, in its repressiveness, in the uptight culture that this cult breeds in every way (and which, incidentally, do not compensate adequately for such good aspects of L.D.S. Mormonism as its zeal for higher education and its appealing hymnody and choral tradition that are so musically notable).I wept when I saw this film, so true to my memories and extensive knowledge of L.D.S. Mormonism is this movie. The scene of the ""church trial"" that the wayward gay missionary undergoes is unbelievably, suffocatingly, and realistically evocative of the funeral home decor, gloom, and stifling atmosphere of a L.D.S. ""ward"" or ""stake"" house (i.e. the equivalent of what would be a local church or meeting house in Christian terms), of the legalistic, unbending self-righteousness of the bishop and elders judging the gay missionary without even the slightest trace of human compassion or understanding, and all the rest of the ""kangaroo court"" proceedings of this scene. However, it is when the lad frees himself at last from his Mormon bondage and joins up with his non-Mormon (""gentile"" in L.D.S. lingo) boyfriend, back in California, that is the point, on the first occasion (in a cinema theatre) that I saw the film, at which I lost my composure and sobbed uncontrollably from the emotion of seeing him drop his L.D.S. Mormon shackles.A note to non-Mormon viewers is not to confuse the L.D.S. cult (i.e. the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah) with the R.L.D.S. (Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) church (now preferring to use the name Community of Christ, with its principal institutions based in Independence, Missouri, and Lamoni, Iowa, in the U.S.A, with Canadian headquarters in Guelph, Ont.), which is Christian, trinitarian, renowned for its peace orientation and generous spirit. There is no need for a film which would reveal the nature of the R.L.D.S. (Community of Christ) denomination, since this denomination is rather harmless, but yet more films like ""Latter Days"" are essential to unmask the worthlessness and oppressive institutional wickedness of the Utah-based L.D.S. Mormon cult.I do not, as a Lutheran Christian (having reverted after Mormonism to my step-father's childhood Christian tradition) condone homosexuality (even if I struggle with it myself, often quite unsuccessfully), but neither do I believe that any religious group should have the unloving harshness towards gay people that the L.D.S. Mormon cult in post-W.W. II times has become notorious for displaying and acting upon. Thankfully, my entire family, immediate and extended, has left L.D.S. Mormonism and converted to Protestant Christianity, with the exception of one very dear elderly lady, who, fortunately but all too untypically, is in no wise the kind of biggot, despite her misguided loyalty to the L.D.S. cult and to her Utah family roots, that so many L.D.S. Mormon women and their men are; there are folks even in the most disastrously negative cults whose spirits rise above the meanness of which their religion reeks.See this film, buying the DVD of it from Amazon.ca to view it again and again, and pity those L.D.S. missionaries who come to your door, and, more importantly, refuse to believe their deceptive tactics and rhetoric, which this movie so compellingly reveals in all their ugliness. This is more than a movie; it is a vivid learning tool about a negative socio-religious phenomenom that deserves rebuke and the opprobrium in which this film covers it.",5,The Latter-day Saints

835096,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002I84JO,Grady Harp,"[0, 0]","LATTER DAYS is a classy little film that holds its own among the light love stories out today. And yet it is more: some unique phobias and prejudices are examined very genuinely and the result is a movie that gives us not only characters about whom we care but enlightens us as to both sides of an ongoing issue: homophobia.Bright, crisp writing and directing by C. Jay Cox, LATTER DAYS presents a tale of a West Hollywood effervescent young man who plays the bar scene and one night stands joie de vivre to the hilt. Christian (Wes Ramsey) lives in a bungalow apartment setting with his roommate Traci (Amber Benson) who is a singer (and a fine one!). Into their rather wild life atmosphere enters a group of Mormon missionaries, out from Utah to spend their requisite two years converting the world to the Church of the Latter Day Saints. All but one are homophobic, redneck types, but one of them, Aaron (Steve Sandvoss), is a closet case gay man. Traci and Christian establish a bet about Christian's able to seduce Aaron and the games begin. The courtship is actually mutual and once the two have been together it is Aaron who feels the anguish and Christian who re-examines his motives and feelings. The rest of the story is tender, deals with many interpersonal issues not at all restricted to the gay world, and revealing the ending would be unfair to the complete enjoyment that this movie offers. Suffice it to say that the cast is excellent and includes wonderful roles as Jacqueline Bissett as owner of the bar/restaurant were Christian works, and Mary Kay Place as Aaron's died-in-the-wool Mormon mother. The pacing is brisk, the acting is top notch, the cinematography is first rate, and the music score is well integrated. But the overall reason to see this film (and see it again) is the sophisticated manner in which C. Jay Cox explores one set of religious issues in the complex pattern of same sex relationships. This is an intelligent, funny, tender, and inspiring movie.

Of the two leads, Mr. Sandvoss (Aaron) is clearly the better Actor while Mr. Ramsey (Christian) is great eye candy and has the unrequited love thing down ! Mr. Ramsey's character Christian is a bit of a cliche - much like Dean Cain's shallow pretty boy in ""The Broken Hearts Club"" and the supporting cast here is largely forgettable, save for Ms. Bissett.

835098,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B0002I84JO,Gregor von Kallahann,"[9, 16]","If you think about it, it's actually a sign of progress in a way that not all gay and lesbian themed films have to be masterpieces.  LATTER DAYS is not a great film.  But it is a good film, a thoughtful film.  It addresses some of the difficult issues of sexuality and religion and does not offer facile answers.  It truthfully reminds us that not all families will come around and embrace their gay children.  It's a sad fact of life, but many religiously conservative clans cannot take that step.  LATTER DAYS at least hints at the beginnings of understanding on the part of conflicted Mormon mother--well played by Mary Kay Place--but by the film's end, it is clear that her now excommunicated son must seek out and embrace a new family, one that accepts and celebrates human difference.Writer/director Jay C. Cox based his depictions of Mormon life on first hand experience.  Scenes of Mormon family life and life among the missionary ""elders"" certainly ring true for that reason.  Although Cox himself is homosexual, he never actually went through the excommunication ritual depicted in the film (which may be why that scene rings a little less true, actually).  Of course, dramatic license allows for that, as well as for some of the other plot developments that may seem dubious (the convenient snowstorm that closes the airport, the mother's awareness of the ""bet,"" and a few other shaky plot developments).  That the movie ultimately works is a testament to the intelligent script, overall fine acting and direction.  Friends I saw this film with thought it must be the gay feel-good movie of the year.  But it's bittersweet.  Something is lost and something is gained.

835100,AEV640MKB3I9J,B0002I84JO,Hank Drake,"[9, 13]","Latter Days is, at the deepest level, a story about the redeeming power of love.  Centered on two characters--Christian (portrayed by Wes Ramsey), a pleasure seeking waiter, and Aaron (Steve Sandvoss), a Mormon missionary hiding his homosexuality--the film serves as both Hollywood romance and coming out story.  With a story such as this, Hollywood formulas abound, but the story is so compelling and exceptionally delivered that these clich&eacute;s work at least well here as they have in any mainstream film.  Writer/director C. Jay Cox has taken the ingredients for hamburger and managed to create--if not filet mignon--at least a respectable strip steak.The film has both strengths and weaknesses.  The characters--even the supporting ones--are well fleshed out, and perfectly cast.  The script is thankfully free of the ""fag-hag"" (homely female who pals around with gay men) character which has become de-riguer in gay oriented films.  The love scenes are handled with frankness, but without lasciviousness.  The script is less of a complete structure than a series of ""rooms"" built on memorable moments which strike so deeply (like when Aaron's mom slaps him, when Christian returns Aaron's watch, the reunion at the end, or when Christian tells Aaron of ""me standing in the snow, telling you I love you."") they resonate long after viewing.  However, the number of plotting coincidences strains credibility.  Not all the dialogue rings true.  Scene transitions are sometimes weak.Any shortcomings, however, are obliterated by the two lead performances.  Sandvoss' masterful, heart-wrenching portrayal of Aaron contains several moments that are tear inducing even on memory.  The facets of Sandvoss' performance are too numerous to list here: the way his voice is often choked with anxiety, the body language indicating discomfort with any kind of male intimacy (note the way he avoids even an innocuous hand on the shoulder from his roommate). Without exaggeration, this is the most notable breakout performance by a young actor since Matt Damon's turn in Good Will Hunting.Also not to be overlooked is Wes Ramsey's turn as Christian--a convincing portrayal of an initially unsympathetic character.  Aaron's story--which is essentially a coming out story--is nearly universal among gay men, whatever their religion. Christian's story, an out gay man with a painful past searching for his better angels, is a bit more esoteric. Many of the negative reviewers missed the foreshadowing Ramsey gave his character, which only became apparent after a second viewing.  Notice, at the beginning, the way he fondles the key necklace while talking to the straight guy--the same necklace which ends up around Aaron's neck at movie's end. It's almost as if Christian were subconsciously saying ""Yeah, I play at being the promiscuous party boy, but there's more to me than meets the eye, and if you find it, you'll own the key to my heart.""  Also, it's apparent there's something brewing in Christian early on by the way he shows concern for Jackie Bisset's character early in the movie.Amidst the wave of ""family values"" speechifying coming from our politicians and right wing talking heads, and the timidity of political correctness, a film that challenges a particular religion is refreshing.  Latter Days has been referred to by some in conservative circles as ""Mormon bashing."" Yet it's fair to ask: What kind of film would the Church of LDS make about homosexuals?  Every work of art reflects the point of view of the artist(s).  Whether one agrees with that point of view or not, art should be judged on its own merits.",4,"Hollywood Romance, with a Twist",1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,3621,"['Latter', 'Days', 'deepest', 'level', 'story', 'redeeming', 'power', 'love', 'Centered', 'two', 'characters', 'Christian', 'portrayed', 'Wes', 'Ramsey', 'pleasure', 'seeking', 'waiter', 'Aaron', 'Steve', 'Sandvoss', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'hiding', 'homosexuality', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'romance', 'coming', 'out', 'story', 'story', 'such', 'Hollywood', 'formulas', 'abound', 'story', 'so', 'compelling', 'exceptionally', 'delivered', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'work', 'least', 'well', 'here', 'have', 'mainstream', 'film', 'Writer/director', 'C.', 'Jay', 'Cox', 'taken', 'ingredients', 'hamburger', 'managed', 'create', 'not', 'filet', 'mignon', 'least', 'respectable', 'strip', 'steak.The', 'film', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'characters', 'even', 'supporting', 'ones', 'are', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'script', 'thankfully', 'free', 'fag-hag', 'homely', 'female', 'who', 'gay', 'men', 'character', 'become', 'de-riguer', 'gay', 'oriented', 'films', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'handled', 'frankness', 'lasciviousness', 'script', 'less', 'complete', 'structure', 'series', 'rooms', 'built', 'memorable', 'moments', 'strike', 'so', 'deeply', 'when', 'Aaron', 'mom', 'when', 'Christian', 'Aaron', 'watch', 'reunion', 'end', 'when', 'Christian', 'tells', 'Aaron', 'standing', 'snow', 'telling', 'love', 'resonate', 'long', 'viewing', 'However', 'number', 'plotting', 'coincidences', 'credibility', 'Not', 'dialogue', 'rings', 'true', 'Scene', 'transitions', 'are', 'sometimes', 'weak.Any', 'shortcomings', 'however', 'are', 'obliterated', 'two', 'lead', 'performances', 'Sandvoss', 'masterful', 'heart-wrenching', 'portrayal', 'Aaron', 'several', 'moments', 'are', 'tear', 'inducing', 'even', 'memory', 'facets', 'Sandvoss', 'performance', 'are', 'too', 'numerous', 'list', 'here', 'way', 'voice', 'often', 'choked', 'anxiety', 'body', 'language', 'indicating', 'discomfort', 'kind', 'male', 'intimacy', 'note', 'way', 'avoids', 'even', 'innocuous', 'hand', 'shoulder', 'roommate', 'exaggeration', 'most', 'notable', 'breakout', 'performance', 'young', 'actor', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'turn', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting.Also', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'Wes', 'Ramsey', 'turn', 'Christian', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'initially', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'Aaron', 'story', 'essentially', 'coming', 'out', 'story', 'nearly', 'universal', 'gay', 'men', 'religion', 'Christian', 'story', 'out', 'gay', 'man', 'painful', 'past', 'searching', 'better', 'angels', 'bit', 'more', 'esoteric', 'Many', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'missed', 'foreshadowing', 'Ramsey', 'gave', 'character', 'only', 'became', 'apparent', 'second', 'viewing', 'Notice', 'beginning', 'way', 'key', 'necklace', 'talking', 'straight', 'guy', 'same', 'necklace', 'up', 'Aaron', 'neck', 'movie', 'end', 'almost', 'Christian', 'were', 'subconsciously', 'saying', 'Yeah', 'play', 'being', 'promiscuous', 'party', 'boy', 'more', 'eye', 'find', ""'ll"", 'own', 'key', 'heart', 'Also', 'apparent', 'something', 'brewing', 'Christian', 'early', 'way', 'concern', 'Jackie', 'Bisset', 'character', 'early', 'movie.Amidst', 'wave', 'family', 'values', 'speechifying', 'coming', 'politicians', 'right', 'wing', 'talking', 'heads', 'timidity', 'political', 'correctness', 'film', 'particular', 'religion', 'refreshing', 'Latter', 'Days', 'been', 'referred', 'conservative', 'circles', 'Mormon', 'bashing', 'fair', 'ask', 'What', 'kind', 'film', 'would', 'Church', 'LDS', 'make', 'homosexuals', 'work', 'art', 'point', 'view', 'artist', 's', 'one', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'art', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'own', 'merits']",N/A

But overall it has too many structural, writing and casting problems to be a truly outstanding film.The structural and writing problems.  First, the plot of the movie is a rehash of every run-of-the-mill teenage sex comedy we've ever seen.  Boy makes bet with friends about conquering love interest; boy pursues love interest; boy gets love interest; love interest learns of bet; boy loses love interest; boy learns deeper truth about himself; boy gets love interest back.  Forget going back to Doris Day and Rock Hudson to find this formula.  It was most recently on display in ""She's All That,"" which was effectively lampooned by Molly Ringwald of all people in ""Not Another Teenage Movie"" with the pithy epitaph ""Teenagers!""Where the  movie deviates from the stock teenage sex comedy, it also deviates in tone, making the film emotionally uneven.  Really, was depiction of an attempted suicide and electroshock anti-gay therapy really necessary, and did it fit in with the rest of the movie?  I don't think so.Additionally, we have the problem of the unexplained coincidence, with Elder Davis meeting Lila Montagne (Jacqueline Bisset) outside the hospital and comforting her.  Now, this coincidence perhaps doesn't rise to the level of Inspector Jarvert's numerous meetings with Jean Valjean, but still, think about it.  What are the odds that Elder Davis would meet Christian's boss outside a hospital, much less that she would give him her card?  This is just sloppy, schmaltz-enabling writing.The movie has other problems as well.  Most importantly, I thought the supporting cast wasn't very good.  They seemed to be reading their lines rather than acting.  The only exception is Jacqueline Bisset.  I don't know what it is about her, but she can take any movie and raise its quality at least a notch or two.  Look at ""Wild Orchid"" and you'll see what I mean.Also, the movie is over the top in its depiction of the Mormon excommunication process.  Trust me.  As a former Mormon missionary myself, I can state that kissing someone -- boy or girl -- *might* get you sent home from your mission, but you certainly wouldn't get excommunicated for it.However, the movie also has several strong points.  First, I thought the leads were outstanding.  Steve Sandvoss has a fresh-faced earnestness that is perfectly suited to the role.  Wes Ramsey is perfectly cast as the shallow hedonist (are there any other kind?).  I also thought the depiction of Elder Davis' fall from Mormon grace to be compassionate and fairly accurate, and although the mother's reaction to her son's homosexual affair might be all little too strong, it certainly is not out of bounds of possibility.Overall, the film is strong in its depiction of people struggling to be who they are.  The homosexual twist is interesting, as is the insight into the Mormon Church.

835107,AYDIQRECV0UJ7,B0002I84JO,Ian Mackay,"[2, 2]","This film bowled me clean out. I haven't been moved so deeply by any film that I can remember. And I've watched it more times than any other - in spite of which it always remains fresh and vital. The actors, all of them, won my heart straight off - especially the two main ones. The theme of a committed believer and an out and out hedonist meeting, locking into, and ultimately healing one another, is a difficult one to tackle - but the success of the director has been phenomenal. The two boys 'convert' each other in a way: the hedonist sees, is mesmerised by, and in the end acquires the depth he sees in the other boy but so pointedly lacks himself; and the Mormon boy is propelled by love through his fears and then through the imprisoning mean-spiritedness and blindness of his parents' faith, to share in the vitality of his friend's love of life - without at all compromising his own integrity or his awareness of and commitment to the spiritual dimension.

No matter what some may say, love is never an accident, never a coincidence. Love is always a miracle and it takes years at times for some of these miracles to work out. This film is about such a miracle, what's more in the capital city of miracles, Los Angeles.On one side a young man who has always been gay and does not have any doubts about it. He is working in a restaurant as a waiter and trying to enjoy life, just enjoy it.One day a young Mormon missionary comes across the street with three of his acolytes. This young man is a greenhorn and as such does not know much about the world and even about the doctrine he is predicating and preaching. He repeats what the other elder associated to him says without understanding he is in many ways ruthlessly bruising the feelings of others. Bruising the feelings of women who are not accepted as equal in the church. Bruising the feelings of the Blacks who are not accepted as equal in the church. Bruising the feelings of the gays who are purely rejected as an abomination, excommunicated and severed from all social links within the reach of the church, not to speak of the shock treatment imposed onto that last category of sinners, because it is a sin to be woman, to be Black or to be gay, and to be gay is the most horrible and the most worst of them all.The point is that this young Mormon, Aaron Davis, is falling in love and one night a kiss will be exchanged and the culprit will be found out by his three other acolytes, right in the act with the devil. And that's the drama. Aaron is packed and sent back home in shame. But  Christian Markelli follows and catches up at the airport of Salt Lake City and the two will discover what love is for a good number of hours in the Airport Inn. But Aaron will run away in the wee hours of the morning.Then the road is going down for both of them.Excommunication and then suicide attempt on one hand. Finding the telephone number, calling up and being rejected, flying over again to give the watch Aaron had left behind back to Aaron. And then a dead end, a tremendous dead end. Life is no longer funny at all.Aaron seems to be the one who has the good sense that most human beings should have. When something does not work stop it, when some place rejects you go away, when something brings displeasure and no pleasure forget it, when something is pure pleasure and joy run for it.That's how love can survive and constantly rebound in a life where there are more obstacles than coincidences, but luckily for love there are miracles, not the divine type but the simple human kind: a decision one human being takes one day to do what they want most and what they like most. And that is natural, though not as frequent as you may think, in the City of Angels.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,"No gay sex, no alcohol, no pleasure, Be a good Mormon",1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,2843,"['believe', 'coincidences', 'believe', 'miracles', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'say', 'love', 'never', 'accident', 'never', 'coincidence', 'Love', 'always', 'miracle', 'years', 'times', 'miracles', 'work', 'out', 'film', 'miracle', 'what', 'more', 'capital', 'city', 'miracles', 'Los', 'Angeles.On', 'one', 'side', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'gay', 'not', 'have', 'doubts', 'working', 'restaurant', 'waiter', 'trying', 'enjoy', 'life', 'just', 'enjoy', 'it.One', 'day', 'young', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'street', 'three', 'acolytes', 'young', 'man', 'greenhorn', 'such', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'world', 'even', 'doctrine', 'predicating', 'preaching', 'what', 'other', 'elder', 'associated', 'understanding', 'many', 'ways', 'ruthlessly', 'bruising', 'feelings', 'others', 'Bruising', 'feelings', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'accepted', 'equal', 'church', 'Bruising', 'feelings', 'Blacks', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'accepted', 'equal', 'church', 'Bruising', 'feelings', 'gays', 'who', 'are', 'purely', 'rejected', 'abomination', 'excommunicated', 'severed', 'social', 'links', 'reach', 'church', 'not', 'speak', 'shock', 'treatment', 'imposed', 'last', 'category', 'sinners', 'sin', 'be', 'woman', 'be', 'Black', 'be', 'gay', 'be', 'gay', 'most', 'horrible', 'most', 'worst', 'point', 'young', 'Mormon', 'Aaron', 'Davis', 'falling', 'love', 'one', 'night', 'kiss', 'will', 'be', 'exchanged', 'culprit', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'three', 'other', 'acolytes', 'right', 'act', 'devil', 'drama', 'Aaron', 'packed', 'sent', 'back', 'home', 'shame', 'Christian', 'Markelli', 'up', 'airport', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'two', 'will', 'discover', 'what', 'love', 'good', 'number', 'hours', 'Airport', 'Inn', 'Aaron', 'will', 'run', 'away', 'wee', 'hours', 'morning.Then', 'road', 'going', 'down', 'them.Excommunication', 'then', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'one', 'hand', 'Finding', 'telephone', 'number', 'calling', 'up', 'being', 'rejected', 'flying', 'over', 'again', 'give', 'watch', 'Aaron', 'had', 'left', 'behind', 'back', 'Aaron', 'then', 'dead', 'end', 'tremendous', 'dead', 'end', 'Life', 'no', 'longer', 'funny', 'all.Aaron', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'good', 'sense', 'most', 'human', 'beings', 'should', 'have', 'When', 'something', 'not', 'work', 'stop', 'when', 'place', 'rejects', 'go', 'away', 'when', 'something', 'displeasure', 'pleasure', 'forget', 'when', 'something', 'pure', 'pleasure', 'joy', 'run', 'it.That', 'how', 'love', 'can', 'survive', 'constantly', 'rebound', 'life', 'where', 'are', 'more', 'obstacles', 'coincidences', 'luckily', 'love', 'are', 'miracles', 'not', 'divine', 'type', 'simple', 'human', 'kind', 'decision', 'one', 'human', 'being', 'one', 'day', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'most', 'what', 'like', 'most', 'natural', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'frequent', 'may', 'think', 'City', 'Angels.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A
835110,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B0002I84JO,James D. Leverton,"[17, 22]","""Latter Days"" (2004) is a good-natured, easy-to-like gay love story that centers on two very different young men:  Morman missionary Elder Aaron Davis (Steve Sandvoss) and West Hollywood party boy Christian (Wes Ramsey), who specializes in seducing straight men.  Underrated by critics and way-way overrated by its target audience of gay men (of which I am neither, by the way), writer/director C. Jay Cox's debut film is a rather ragged, though ribaldly funny and at times sweet tale, that unfortunately hinges on one of the stalest plot devices of all time:  the fifty dollar bet, a contrivance that is unnecessary and should once and for all be given the burial it deserves.The film opens with Davis and three other missionaries moving next door to Christian and his best friend Julie, an aspiring pop singer who works with Christian at Lila's, an upscale restaurant run by the elegant Lila (Jacqueline Bisset, in a welcome return to the screen).  Christian's gaydar goes off the minute he sees Davis, and he ends up betting Julie and his other wisecracking coworkers that he can seduce Davis.  He almost succeeds, but Davis is appalled when Christian says their dalliance ""doesn't have to mean anything"" and accuses him of being shallow ""fluff.""  This sends Christian into crisis mode, and he ends up volunteering at Project Angel Food, where one of his clients is a bitter AIDS patient (Erik Palladino), who ends up teaching Christian a thing-or-two about life.  But then the unthinkable happens: Christian finds not only that he isn't just a shallow party boy, but that he is falling in love with Davis.  Unfortunately, when they finally share a romantic kiss they are discovered by Davis' roommates (including a homophobic jerk gratingly played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  Davis is subsequently sent home to Pocatello, Idaho to not only face the wrath of his conservative, unforgiving parents (including Mary Kay Place in a knockout performance), but to be excommunicated and sent into a rehabilitation clinic so he can return to ""normal.""This is all fine, as these things go, and everything wraps up in a pleasant, though rather predictable manner.  If Cox has an ax to grind with the Morman Church, he certainly makes his point here since the Church is seen as homophobic, ignorant, unforgiving and hypocritical.  However, Davis is, pointedly, also the most religious member of his missionary group and possesses a real and deep religious faith, so true religious faith emerges unscathed, just as the fanaticism that comes with some organized religions doesn't.As for the performances, Sandvoss and Ramsey score impressively in their roles, but it is the supporting cast that really impresses.  Place is simply wonderful as Sister Davis, who loves her son deeply but simply cannot find a way to forgive him for his unspeakable sin, and Palladino steals every scene he's in as the AIDS patient who opens Christian's eyes.  Also, the unknown actors who play Julie and the rest of Christian's coworkers, along with Davis' fellow missionaries are uniformly excellent, with the exception of Gordon-Levitt, who misses the boat in an over-the-top, unpleasant performance as an ignorant jerk you'll beg to see sucker-punched.  As for Bisset, she adds a welcome touch of elegance to the proceedings, although she should never be asked to cry on cue (it ain't pretty, believe me).Cox's script is strictly by-the-numbers, but does have some great lines and genuine laughs.  A word of warning to the non-gay viewers who may be drawn to the film because of its religious content:  Cox throws in an extensive gay sex scene about an hour in that is just a shot-or-two away from an NC-17 rating, so definitely proceed with caution and keep the kids away.  As for his direction, Cox does the best he can with an ultra-low budget and doesn't avoid bringing a rather ragged look to the proceedings.  He does manage to shoot several scenes on location, however, and the film is refreshingly free of continuity and boom-mike errors that plague many other low-budget films.In all, the film is better than its reviews, some of which were unfairly scathing, especially in Utah (surprise, surprise).  As for the film's fans, some clearly have overrated it unmercifully, to the point of calling it Oscar-worthy, which is laughable.  However, ""Latter Days"" is definitely worth seeing and may even leave viewers with a tear or two at the end.  In all, it's a significant achievement for Cox, who has now atoned for his real sin--the awful rubble of his ""Sweet Home Alabama"" script, which was his prior claim-to-fame.Incidentally, this review applies to the film alone and not the DVD presentation, since it was written before the DVD was released.  *** (out of *****)",3,"Good-natured, touching gay love story",1093651200,"08 28,

Jay Cox served as writer/director/songwriter for this impressive indie starring Steve Sandvoss, Wes Ramsey, Jacqueline Bisset, Rebekah Jordan, and Erik Palladino.  Cox drew on his own personal experience to mold this amazing love story between Aaron (Sandvoss), a Mormon missionary, and Christian (Ramsey), an LA party boy.  With taste and class, but an ever-keen eye for the truth, Cox weaves a masterful tale of love interrupted by the intense pressures of family and religion.  It is no wonder this film was a hit across the United States and the world -- its message of social injustice tempered by the power of faith in oneself, in family, in friends, and in love is one that everyone, both straight and gay, can appreciate.Prepare yourself for a beautifully crafted story that has a firm basis in reality -- these social, political, and religious issues are very true-to-life.  Cox's artful response to today's social challenges has provided countless many with hope and inspiration.

835113,A325XRD76NNY2N,B0002I84JO,JC,"[11, 15]","C. Jay Cox (who also wrote Sweet Home Alabama) brings us a touching, heartwarming love story about Aaron, a closeted Mormon missionary, played by the handsome and endearing Steve Sandvoss, who falls for a West Hollywood, pretty boy, Christian, Wes Ramsey, while spreading the gospel in and around ""Sodom and Gommorah"", Los Angeles. The two cultures collide and the storyline, although a bit contrived at times, touches on some serious issues like, faith, homosexuality, AIDS, and teen suicide, but with a soft touch and is never forced upon you but opens it up for discussion and thought. C. Jay Cox grew up Mormon and brings us this story from his own personal views and draws upon his own experiences to tell the tale of love and redemption. It's too bad that there wasn't a theatrical as well as a director's cut of this film as this could've made a great mainstream movie and should be seen by everyone. Unfortunately, it never made it to most theaters most likely due to the fact of the nudity, gay sex, and a couple of surreal sexual scenes. In any event, it has found its way to DVD and I highly recommend this to anyone, gay or straight.Aaron lands in L.A. with three other ""elders"", willing to give up television, radio, newspapers, etc left only to study and spread the Lord's word. After moving into the same complex as Christian, the cute party boy who has an appetite for one night stands, and his best friend Julie, an upcoming singer, sparks and sexual tension begin to rise. Christina tells his pals at the restaurant, Lila's, they all work at of his newfound complex mates and one of them bets he can't bed one of the ""elders"" and all bets are on. As the story unfolds we find out Aaron has suppressed his homosexual tendencies and he frequently wakes at night to watch Christian arrive home with one of his tricks. It isn't until Christian gets injured and Aaron takes him in, cleans his wounds, and the sexual tension between them begins to heat up. Moments they meet while doing laundry they discuss various issues regarding faith, love, and commitments and Christian begins to realize there's more to life then just one--night stands and casual sex. One of his friends is involved with a meal delivery program to AIDS patients and Christian, with his new outlook on life, begins to help out. There are some wonderful exchanges between him and his client that are really touching. Further along the story the other elders catch Aaron and Christian in a passionate embrace and with that Aaron is shipped back home and excommunicated from the church. Tensions rise with his family and there's a fine performance by Mary Kay Place as his mother who never waivers with her position and religious beliefs. She fails to accept her son. Christian meanwhile is heartbroken and tries to reach him, as his friend Julie begins to make it in the music industry, and life goes on. Will Aaron's family finally accept him? Will Christian find true love and with who? Will Julie make it big in the biz? These are the ""Latter Days of Our Lives"". A wonderful story that is both heartwarming and charming I can't recommend it enough. A perfect date movie!The film also features some great supporting roles with Joseph Gordon-Levitt (kid from Third Rock from the Sun) as one of his missionary brethren, Jacqueline Bisset, owner of ""Lila's"", a restaurant where Christian and his friends work and hang out, Mary Kay Place, Aaron's mother, and Rebekah Jordan, who gives a terrific performance as Christian's best friend and confident. The movie also features a fine soundtrack with songs written by C. Jay Cox, one performed by Toad the Wet Sprocket, among others.

The acting struck me as superb, the storyline consistent and smooth, and the ""lessons"" that the film suggested to be subtle and without either banality or preachiness.  ""Latter Days"" is one of the few Gay films that I would, in fact, recommend to Straight audiences without hesitation -- and one I would equally recommend to a few ""jaded"" Gay acquaintances that I think could learn a thing or two and maybe remember that smiling (and maybe even an honest tear or two) isn't going to make their own little bandwaggons crash in flames.I did, however, slightly regret the fact that I had read the book before seeing the film.  I think the last half hour or so of the film would have been far more powerful to me had I not known what the outcome was supposed to be.  This is one case where I heartily advice a potential viewer NOT to read the book first.  C. Jay Cox' efforts will be far more effective to someone who is led by his visual presentation alone.In closing, I can offer no serious negative criticism for this film.  I love it; I loved the characters; and I loved the ending.  In fact, I watched the last track three times.  This movie is a ""keeper"" and a ""giver.""

So many people listed this as an all-time favorite, a sleeper than they were surprised they liked so much.  I gave the movie at shot, and it was well worth it.  Believe the reviews--this is an unforgettable film.The plot (sexual tension between an LA party boy and a closeted Mormon missionary) could very easily have been trite, but the story and the actors make it come alive.  Each of the two boys grew during their relationship, finding new parts to their personalities and overcoming personal challenges.  Neither boy was the 2-dimensional stereotype one might imagine based on the plot description.The Mormon church is actually portrayed pretty objectively, not overtly negatively, and as a viewer, I connected with the missionaries and how truly they believed in their cause and their church.  I learned a lot about Mormon beliefs and rites of passage, too.Overall this movie is about two boys coming to terms with themselves through a relationship that goes against all odds.

The soundtrack was excellent, the acting was great, and for those who are Buffy fans, Tara is in this movie and not as prim and proper as she was in Buffy. The only problem I had wasn't with the movie, it was with the soundtrack. Julie has a good voice while singing in the movie, but she doesn't appear on the soundtrack, which I was told is because she wasn't signed on for the soundtrack before she did the movie. Oh well, you can always access the extras feature and sing along with the video for the song off the DVD. The videos include 'More', 'Another Beautiful Day', and my favorite, 'Tuesday, 3 a.m.'.

835120,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B0002I84JO,J. Martin,"[2, 4]","I bought ""Latter Days"" because I've been watching gay romance movies lately, guided primarily by Amazon reviews, and this was the next high-rated one I came across. I watched it, as I'm watching all of them, primarily for entertainment, not for help in dealing with being gay.I grew up during the 50s and 60s in the heart of the Bible Belt, and I've been a born-again Christian for almost 40 years, so I've had a lot of experience with religious opposition to homosexuality. But I've resolved those issues for myself in a way that's a lot more satisfactory than what this movie offers, so for me it's just a love story.As a love story, this one is okay. As a movie, it's not very good. Not bad, just a little clunky and amateurish. Maybe if the acting had been better, the romance might have been more believable and moving.Stephen Sandvoss is one of the world's most beautiful and evidently nicest men, so it's hard to imagine ANYBODY--male or female, gay or straight--not melting into a puddle at his feet. But besides that, there's not much to make the relationship between his Aaron and Wes Ramsey's Chris believable. The two actors clearly did their best, with obvious dedication and sincerity, but they just didn't pull it off. There was neither the burning passion of movies like ""Just a Question of Love"" and ""Shelter,"" nor the tenderness of ""Beautiful Thing."" It was more like seeing two magnets slam together and stick than watching two human beings drawn to each other by any kind of real human desire.Until recently I would have assumed that the stiffness was partly because the actors are straight, and talent alone could never make them gay enough for the sexual attraction to be really believable. But the movie I saw before this one blew that argument out of the water. That was the extraordinary French movie ""Presque Rien,"" whose lead actors also are straight, so I know straight actors can do it.In ""Presque Rien"" (the English-subtitled version is called ""Come Undone""), not only is the attraction between the two main characters completely believable--both very tender AND very passionate--but the characters themselves are deeply dimensioned, fully formed human beings, not caricatures at all. Although they do evolve to a limited extent in ""Latter Days,"" Aaron and Chris are never more than caricatures.I'm not saying there's anything wrong with caricatures. They can be very useful in getting a point across, but they're not as interesting in themselves as real, complex human characters are. Mathieu and C&eacute;dric in ""Presque Rien"" are real, complex human characters who are hard NOT to believe in.C Jay Cox's screenplay, songs, and direction in ""Latter Days"" are pretty good, but I found one thing he did over and over very annoying. There's plenty of full nudity in this movie--including a long scene with Aaron and Chris making love and then talking in bed, completely naked and without a cover in sight--but there's not a single frame anywhere in this movie with a penis in it. Not one. To me, that's just weird.It's not that I insist on seeing penises--I've seen plenty of them--but it gets weird when in scene after scene after scene that's the only thing you DON'T see. And the way it's done isn't natural. The characters move around like acrobats into all sorts of positions that ought naturally to leave them exposed, but every single time that's about to happen, a knee or a thigh or some other conveniently choreographed body part--or even the clutter on a hotel-room credenza--pops up in EXACTLY the right spot just in the nick of time to be a virtual fig leaf, protecting our eyes from the ONLY part of the male anatomy we're evidently not allowed to see.It comes off as coy and unnatural and very irritating. Men have penises. If you're going to have naked men gamboling around in your movie and you're going to show EVERYTHING else, please don't leave out the penises as if there's something wrong with them! It's just creepy. I can understand not wanting to show limp penises in a torrid sex scene (that could be even weirder), but afterwards, when the men are just talking, why not?When I discovered that there are two versions of this DVD, an unrated and an R-rated version, I thought maybe I ended up with the R-rated version by mistake, but I checked and I didn't. Mine is unrated. There's really no excuse for this kind of coyness in an unrated gay movie, unless the actors insisted on it.Since they're both straight and were new in the business when ""Latter Days"" was made, maybe Sandvoss and Ramsey just didn't want their private parts shown all over the Internet. If that's what happened, it's understandable. But if it was done to satisfy some sick standard of ""decency,"" it's not. In either case, what Cox should have done instead was have much less general nudity in the movie, not censor penises only.Three of the other movies I mentioned above don't show penises much either, if at all, but they also don't show anywhere near as much nudity, so the overall effect seems natural. ""Presque Rien"" shows a lot of both nudity and penises. Either of those formulas is fine. It's just this castrated sort of nudity that's weird.As I said, I didn't get personal encouragement or comfort from this movie as others have, mainly because I didn't need it. But I take their word that it's here, and I deeply respect anything, including this movie, that helps wounded human beings heal. It's just not something I can testify to myself.",3,"Okay gay romance, not very good movie, castrated nudity",1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,5478,"['bought', 'Latter', 'Days', ""'ve"", 'been',

Christian  and his work mates while a bit stereotypical are certainly not unusual for the types one often encounter in LA.  If anything Christian's sudden awakening to his shallowness was a bit difficult to believe.  There are plenty of guys in WeHo who would see more than a little of themselves in him.  I was amused by the restaurant owner as she very much reminded of a woman I worked for some years ago.The Mormon boys were well portrayed.  The vaguely homoerotic behaviour between them when they first move in would not be unusual in any college dorm or frat house.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons why Mormons typically have an older married couple supervising the boys on their mission.  I have met guys very similar in mindset and behaviour and recall a friend telling me a very similar story about what had occurred when he was on his mission back in the 70's to Saipan of all places.  There were a couple of things which did not seem consistent with Mormon theology not that most people would know that but they fit the story line well.  The hostility towards homosexuality is very well portrayed, as was the ""therapy"".  A friend who had attended Brigham Young Univ once recounted a similar story to me.If anything I would have liked to have seen the charecters  fleshed out more.  It was as if I was just meeting them and I really did want to get to know them better.  It was hard to understand why the one missionary suddenly had such a dramatic change of heart and told Christian where Aaron is going to be.  I thought they got Aaron's angst down perfectly.  The use of the watch was inspired. The ending was a bit too sweet for me but well played.

835126,A3OA0PLUJKWEJ3,B0002I84JO,"John Parker Marmaro ""gilfaethwy""","[9, 12]","I was surprised at how great this film was. Great, not in the shallow sense of ""Great!"" but as in greatness.  And in every single sense:  screenplay, direction, acting, all.  There has been a glut of gay-themed films lately (Great!) but though many are either funny or quirky or sexy or trendy, there is often either a lack of real substance about them (eg., wispy slice-of-life movies like ""Trick"", ""Drift"", etc.) or a kind of stilted artificiality (often with drag films like ""Girls Will Be Girls"" or ""Die, Mommie, Die"", their good elements notwithstanding, but equally in many others as well). So many seem to be trying so hard to be ""gay"" films that something is lost in the process.  This film towers over them-- in part because it doesn't try to-- in part because it is relentlessly honest, real, believable.  The title, of course,  refers to the Mormon Church: it is instructive to compare this film with another gay-themed recent work involving Mormons: ""Angels in America"". That play, and Mike Nichols' admittedly fine adaptation of it, has received more attention, and more recognition & kudos, than ""Latter Days"" probably ever will.  This is not just a pity, it is an injustice: ""Latter Days"" may not have the wide reaching apocalyptic aspirations of ""Angels in America"" but it is a greater work in every important way. It is structurally better wrought; ""Angels"" is a very artificial work which tries for surrealism, symbolism, and realism and cannot strike a viable balance between them. It raises issues and establishes situations that are never integrated into the whole, or resolved, or even followed through. The emotions are forced, they are exterior; it is a cold work which never really engages our hearts, or even, finally, our minds.  ""Latter Days"" sets itself more modest goals but achieves them magnificently.  The confrontation of the two main characters, played so marvellously by Wes Ramsey and Steve Sandvoss, is finely gauged and achieves something that ""Angels"" never does:  the characters change.  They grow; in part in response to each other, in part to the changed perceptions of their worlds that their relationship creates. Other reviewers on this site have dealt with the confrontation in the film of gayness and homophobic patriarchal religion (Mormonism here); I simply want to call attention to how sensitively and honestly it was dealt with.  And amomg the many felicities of its admirably well-structured screenplay, I would like to mention its two views of kinds of motherhood:  Mary Kay Place's character, the ""biological"" mother-- yet unaccepting and ultimately unloving; and Jacqueline Bisset's character, not a mother in the physical sense, but embodying all the finest aspects of mother-love to her ""children"" (Christian & his coworkers).  And most of all, I have to praise the play of moods in this film: humor, irony, passion, guilt, grief, joy-- all ring utterly true, utterly real: and for this the formidable talents of Messers Ramsey and Sandvoss loom large, supported by the rest of this admirable cast.  Some have called the arc of events in this film predictable.  I cannot agree.  Repeatedly, when a situation arose which felt like it was leading into a cliche, the film surprised me by not falling for it, not taking the easy route. The sex scenes were handled beautifully, some passionate, some humorous; none ever egregious or prurient.  The references to AIDS as well were done in a simple, non-preachy, non-""Dark Victory"" way (if you will). And this movie most of all embraces real sentiment, not sentimentality, as is too often the case with ""gay"" films:  it made this jaded reviewer weep, a real achievement as I'm the type who sneers at sentimentality & bathos. If the scene where Christian returns Aaron's watch, and the penultimate scene, do not get you teary, you're not only coldhearted, you haven't any heart at all.  I have only just recently seen ""Latter Days"", so my impressions may settle out, but I think it one of the best films I have seen in quite a long time, gay or otherwise.  It is the finest gay film since ""Maurice"", but more pertinent to today's conditions; in short, it is a gem-- a Mozart concerto to ""Angels in America""'s Mahler symphony.

835129,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0002I84JO,Jonathan Appleseed,"[12, 15]","This is so much more than a story of sexual confusion, and of an ill-conceived bet for a ""pretty boy"" to bear as trophy the undergarments of a Mormon. The generic descriptions do this movie a grave injustice.Rather, this is a story about the struggle of the human spirit to overcome obstacles, to overcome biases and prejudices in order to reach the fullness of being. If that sounds Zen, well, I make no apologies. That's how it is.What's most moving about this film is that it's not simply the Mormon who struggles. That which makes it moving also makes it unique. Certainly, the Mormon struggles - but he is not confused. He knows that he is gay, and we can guess that he has been in secret possession of that knowledge for some time. The uniqueness here is that there is a struggle within the openly gay character, Christian (yes, this is assuredly a metaphorical name) as well. We see a pretty boy, shallow, a person who has given little or no thought to his life past doing reps at the gym (and what is that, a ten-pack for a stomach?) and securing conquests at the bars. Our first introduction to him is his brag that he his lips have exemplary skills when it comes to ""certain activities"". In other words, we see him as a slut.He is challenged here by this Mormon who moves into his community, and the challenge reminded me of another great film, As Good As It Gets. Jack Nicholson's character said to Helen Hunt's character, ""You make me want to be a better man."" No greater compliment could be proffered from one person to another, and here the openly gay character, Christian, says that to the Mormon, Aaron, though in different words. It is beautiful and profound.Christian's struggle to rise above his own shallowness is equal to Aaron's struggles with the rigour of his religion (Mormons view homosexuality as an abomination, as do so many sadly blinded religions). Once it is pointed out to him, Christian begins to give of himself to his community, specifically volunteering his services to Meals on Wheels. During this, he meets another person who sees him for who/what he is. Aaron's own pronouncement of his shallowness was probably not enough; he needed another declaration, and one of the persons on his delivery gives it to him. He is a man deeply afflicted with AIDS, who is on an oxygen tank, and whose skin is riddled with Kaposi's Sarcoma. Christian's repugnance and embarrassment is evident, and the man ridicules him for it. When he touches Christian, he says, ""All I see is snow."" Like a television that isn't tuned in - all he sees when he touches Christian is snow, and he analogizes that with his character. Undoubtedly this moves Christian to look within himself, to try and find the depth that exists there, to become a better man.All of this does not trivialize Aaron's struggles. I can't write of them, for if I did so I would be giving too much away, and this review wouldn't be published. As I have said, Aaron is *not* confused about his sexuality, but he is also not aggressive in uncovering it. The manner in which he and Christian resolve their love is wrenching and beautiful beyond comprehension. Dry eyes have no place during this resolution.After having recently viewed movies such as Issues 101, and Denied, it was a genuine thrill to view a gay themed movie with real substance that had exemplary acting, writing, and direction. Too few gay themed movies are plainly horrid. This is not. This is worthy of comparison to any great film that focuses on the triumph of the human spirit.It is difficult for me to imagine anyone (other than Jerry Falwell and his ilk) watching this movie and not being profoundly moved.

835130,A3VY0Y0J93ZO59,B0002I84JO,"Jonathan Hansen ""Random Scribe""","[0, 1]","Love isn't silly at all.  This story is a sensitive treatment of consenting adults, and a group of people who oppose their adult choices by holding to different principles, namely that tolerance should belong first to one's family rather than to whom one chooses to love.Where the LDS would have exacted from Aaron a life of celibacy, it feels to me rather as if he is fallen into grace, not fallen from it, by his acceptance into a community which didn't condemn him to end his life in loneliness and despair.  Yes, it was cruel to have a bet about who could seduce the new boy in the condo.  But life is seldom fair.One might be tempted to write this off as a happily ever after gay romance. It's not overly stereotypical, portraying a group of people growing together because two people fell in love.  As an adult, having observed love to come in many more flavors than merely plain vanilla, I'm deliberately overlooking the discomfort threshold of same sex intimacy.  There's a lot of it in this film.On the one hand, I'd never encourage anyone to insert any object in their rectum.  Not because of sin consciousness, but because it initially programs one's physiology to 'accept' the risk of having ultimately to wear adult diapers.  And that's something that can happen with or without externally stressing the sphincter musculature.  X-rated activity is scrupulously omitted from the video footage, however jibed about or otherwise alluded to.Love, on the other hand, may be as fickle as coyote, or as steadfast as Platonic eros.  Watching Aaron being therapeutically electro-shocked in accompaniment to porno pictures of men, it seemed to me his love obscured them all, preferring the memory of his friend he loved.  Platonic eros isn't simply lust.  It has the durability of agape/charity to bond to another.  Likewise, Platonic eros aspires to the loyalty, the fealty/fidelity of that other kind of brotherly kindness/affection, called phileo, which is very much the familial type of love when quarreling ceases.  I guess I'm trying to foreshadow this idea that the characters in the movie have love which extends to improving relationships and quality of lives around them, despite the religious tensions introduced.  We might understand that Aaron submitted to the counseling creepiness instigated by his family because he was loath to let go of loving his family as well, even when they became altogether hostile.  'They' left him no choice other than leaving.Finally, when the beloved other stands framed in the mantle of our lives desirous to share the most common or simplest tasks like laundering, grooming, preparing meals, etc, we are invoked.  Our whole being (todo corazon) is summoned forth, not unlike Lazarus, from Stygian caverns of despair, from self-deprivation, relinquishing the inner mine field of psychological defense mechanisms we've evolved from all our earliest experience.Coincidentally, these guys are quite athletic.",4,Love doesn't come in a minute; sometimes it doesn't come at all,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,2954,"['Love', ""n't"", 'silly', 'story', 'sensitive', 'treatment', 'consenting', 'adults', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'oppose', 'adult', 'choices', 'holding', 'different', 'principles', 'namely', 'tolerance', 'should', 'belong', 'first', 'one', 'family', 'rather', 'whom', 'one', 'love.Where', 'LDS', 'would', 'have', 'exacted', 'Aaron', 'life', 'celibacy', 'rather', 'fallen', 'grace', 'not', 'fallen', 'acceptance', 'community', 'did', ""n't"", 'condemn', 'end', 'life', 'loneliness', 'despair', 'Yes', 'was', 'cruel', 'have', 'bet', 'who', 'could', 'seduce', 'new', 'boy', 'condo', 'life', 'seldom', 'fair.One', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'write', 'off', 'happily', 'ever', 'gay', 'romance', 'not', 'overly', 'stereotypical', 'portraying', 'group', 'people', 'growing', 'together', 'two', 'people', 'fell', 'love', 'adult', 'having', 'observed', 'love', 'come', 'many', 'more', 'flavors', 'merely', 'plain', 'vanilla', ""'m"", 'deliberately', 'overlooking', 'discomfort', 'threshold', 'same', 'sex', 'intimacy', 'lot', 'film.On', 'one', 'hand', ""'d"", 'never', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'insert', 'object', 'rectum', 'Not', 'sin', 'consciousness', 'initially', 'programs', 'one', 'physiology', ""'accept"", 'risk', 'having', 'ultimately', 'wear', 'adult', 'diapers', 'something', 'can', 'happen', 'externally', 'stressing', 'sphincter', 'musculature', 'X-rated', 'activity', 'scrupulously', 'omitted', 'video', 'footage', 'however', 'jibed', 'otherwise', 'alluded', 'to.Love', 'other', 'hand', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'fickle', 'coyote', 'as', 'steadfast', 'Platonic', 'eros', 'Watching', 'Aaron', 'being', 'therapeutically', 'electro-shocked', 'accompaniment', 'porno', 'pictures', 'men', 'seemed', 'love', 'obscured', 'preferring', 'memory', 'friend', 'loved', 'Platonic', 'eros', ""n't"", 'simply', 'lust', 'durability', 'agape/charity', 'bond', 'Likewise', 'Platonic', 'aspires', 'loyalty', 'fealty/fidelity', 'other', 'kind', 'brotherly', 'kindness/affection', 'called', 'phileo', 'very', 'much', 'familial', 'type', 'love', 'when', 'quarreling', 'ceases', 'guess', ""'m"", 'trying', 'foreshadow', 'idea', 'characters', 'movie', 'have', 'love', 'improving', 'relationships', 'quality', 'lives', 'religious', 'tensions', 'introduced', 'might', 'understand', 'Aaron', 'submitted', 'counseling', 'creepiness', 'instigated', 'family', 'was', 'loath', 'let', 'go', 'loving', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'when', 'became', 'altogether', 'hostile', 'left', 'choice', 'other', 'leaving.Finally', 'when', 'beloved', 'other', 'stands', 'framed', 'mantle', 'lives', 'desirous', 'share', 'most', 'common', 'simplest', 'tasks', 'laundering', 'grooming', 'preparing', 'meals', 'etc', 'are', 'invoked', 'whole', 'being', 'corazon', 'summoned', 'forth', 'not', 'Lazarus', 'Stygian', 'caverns', 'despair', 'self-deprivation', 'relinquishing', 'inner', 'mine', 'field', 'psychological', 'defense', 'mechanisms', ""'ve"", 'evolved', 'earliest', 'experience.Coincidentally', 'guys', 'are', 'quite', 'athletic']",N/A

The story was one that resonated deeply for me, but the acting and direction fall far short of excellence.Aaron Davis is a young Mormon away on his mission trip to Southern California. He moves in with three other missionaries, all of whom call each other only by the title Elder, and sets out to make his family proud. Christian is an unrepentant party boy. He lives only for his next sexual conquest. When Aaron moves into his apartment complex, it doesn't take long for Christian to notice the attractive young man. Christian makes a bet with his coworkers at a local restaurant that he can seduce one of the missionaries and sets his sights on Aaron.Aaron is well aware of his homosexuality, but he fights his feelings towards the beautiful and alluring Christian. A series of encounters and flirtations culminate with Aaron telling Christian that he can't be with him because Christian is shallow and only interested in sex.Shaken by the confrontation, Christian sets out to prove Aaron wrong by volunteering for an AIDS support group. When Christian and Aaron finally kiss, they are caught by the other missionaries, and Aaron is promptly sent away for excommunication for being homosexual.Aaron, devastated by the rejection of his church and his family, attempts suicide and finds himself placed in radical ex-gay program. Meanwhile, Christian is desperate to contact Aaron, but is repeatedly rebuffed by his family. Will the two boys find one another again?Latter Days is different from many gay-themed movies in that it deals with serious issues such as faith, family, and finding a deeper meaning in your life. It is to be commended for having the vision to reach for such lofty goals. I only wish it had the talent to back it up. The script is uneven, offering some wonderfully snappy one-liners, but often glossing over important scenes. Watching the movie, I repeatedly got the impression that large chunks of the story were dropped in order to keep the movie under a certain running time. For instance, we're expected to believe that Aaron and Christian have developed a deep and meaningful love after a few brief conversations over laundry. The significance of certain scenes was completely lost on me, although the movie seemed to indicate they were full of portent. A few times, the movie comes across more like soft-core porn than a genuine film. The acting, too, left something to be desired. Several of the actors could have been reading directly from their script for all the emotion they put into their lines--although in their defense, sometimes the script itself was to blame. There were a few standouts who delivered powerfully subtle performances, even given what they had to work with--most notably Mary Kay Place as Aaron's mother. I also enjoyed Jacqueline Bisset's character Lila, the owner of the restaurant where Christian worked. She serves as a sort of emotional center for the story, getting many of the movie's best lines.Despite its many faults, I really enjoyed Latter Days. The ending definitely saved it for me. Of course, it incorporated one of my favorite themes: chosen family.

It highlights the hypocracy of what people will say and do in the name of religion.  In my humble opinion, religion is great if you remove the people.  A serious gay movie with a happy ending is pretty magical in itself.Okay, the movie is entertaining, the message is important, the acting is very good, there are plenty of heart-warming moments, it's believable, loved it.  In the unrated version there is some nudity, it's natural and well done, the two actors have great chemistry together and it does not deter from the serious theme of this movie.  Gay people, whether you play the field or are in a monogamous relationship will see the nudity as real and lifelike.  The two lead actors are beautiful, toned and well-shaped.  I would rather see limited nudity, like in this film, that is very natural than two guys trying to cover up with the sheets or find poses that cover up there penises or pubes, it's silly, they were just intimate and they are gay, it would never happen in real life.  Bravo on the way nudity was handled.DVD QUALITY: very disappointed that THE SOUND WAS 2-CHANNEL STEREO instead of the advertised 5.1 channel surround.

As the president of the Pocatello team of Mormons, he sits in judgment on his own son in a quiet room dominated by three long folding tables dragged together to form what amounts to a stage.  The accused boy sits way upstage as the tribunal begins.  The father's words are so cold that frost forms in the air as he breathes.  Mary Kay Place plays the mother, a woman hurt by her husband's abandonment of her.  He spends all of his time with church affairs to avoid having to deal with her, the woman he blames for the homosexuality of Aaron.  He can't even bear to be with her.  Will she ever learn the simple lesson that is engraved on Aaron's pocketwatch?  Faith, hope and charity, ""and the greatest of these is love.""Not really a sympathetic part, but Place does wonders with it, making you feel what it would be like to have staked nearly everything, all of one's identity, on the continued heterosexuality of another, in this case one's son.  How did she wind up in this unstable position?  Naturally the movie, a romantic comedy at heart, doesn't investigate too deeply the place of women in a society largely organized around the sexual impulses of men, but that's okay.We couldn't decide whether the main boy, the waiter Christian Markelli, was actually as cute as he was supposed to be or whether he's actually plain, and beautified by self-confidence and tiny Hugo Boss briefs.  The actor, Wes Ramsey, is welcome to pay a call at our apartment any old time so we can solve this dilemma once and for all.LATTER DAYS isn't a very sophisticated movie, and some of the dialogue will have you rolling your eyes in ecstasy it's so bad, but it gets the important things right--there's chemistry in all the right places.  I keep thinking of poor Aaron's speech about reading the comic strips up close and seeing only dots, and then him hoping that God sees us not as dots but as something that makes sense when viewed from a distance.

Weeping is not accompanied by a single teardrop!  The production quality is adequate, but certainly not first-rate, commensurate with the obviously smaller budget.  Still, the cast and crew do the best job with what they have, and at times exceed those limitations.  The movie is clearly a labor of love.  The writing, the acting (other than the tears), the simplistic story, which becomes a study of the psychology of motivations all add a foundation to the movie that, for this viewer, add up to an uplifting, even mesmerizing, love story and more.  The secondary characters really elevate this movie above the limitations imposed by budget, and make you forget and forgive its faults.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Khary Payton, Rob McElhenney, and especially Erik Palladino add that elusive layer to make this movie, moment by moment, connect.  Even Bisset, whom I've never been a huge fan of, makes me want to watch her again and again. (In spite of her bone-dry face in the bench scene where she's &#34;balling&#34; having finally acquiesced to a friend's wish to pull the plug.)

835147,A2IS1BTDQ6MGX,B0002I84JO,Kyle,"[7, 8]","Let me start this review by saying that I am an active Mormon.  As such, I had serious reservations about watching this movie.  I am not really a supporter of the Gay cause, but after 2 years of wavering and wondering, I finally got up the courage and watched it.It is rare for me to find a film as utterly amazing as this one.  Modern movies tend to be glamour and glitz but have no soul.  Not so with Latter Days.  In addition to excellent acting by the leads, the story was moving and intriguing that shook me to my core and left me in tears...crying for more.What about the Mormon side of the movie?  Well, as a Mormon, I was not offended by the movie's portrayal of the LDS Church.  True, the Church does come off looking a bit archaic and mideval, and the Mormon characters are more caricatures than actual portrayals. However, this is a necessary element to presenting the film's message: the conflict that religious homosexuals face between their beliefs and their feelings.  In seeing exaggerations of our prejudices and fears, we have the opportunity of reevaluating ourselves and asking why we are afraid of people who are different.The movie helps heterosexuals understand that members of the gay community are individuals with their own feelings, and that many of them suffer from the conflicts they face.  It also reminds those of us who believe in a moral law that mandates a heterosexual lifestyle, to look on our brothers in charity (1 Cor. 13:13), offering them the love and understanding they need and deserve, the kind of love Jesus would have afforded them.However, the film accomplishes this without being preachy or attempting to state that the gay lifestyle is in any way ""better"" than the straight lifestyle, and in this it shines.When Brokeback Mountain was released, it was heralded as revolutionary, moving, and powerful.  However, Brokeback somehow lacked the love and the story to make its point.  Latter Days, however, does more.  Somehow, I equate this film with The Thorn Birds, trumpeting ""forbidden love,"" and presenting real emotion, real passion, and - yes - real love for all of us to reconsider.The movie does have some sex and nudity, however this is for the most part done tastefully and full of love.To sum up my thoughts, Latter Days is a delightful movie of a real and authentic romance that will leave you in tears.  Though it is somewhat critical of the LDS Church, the criticism is more of the intolerable and uncharitable in all churches rather than a direct criticism of the Mormons.  To those who have developed a sense of Charity and understanding, this will not be offensive, but will rather be eye-opening.",5,A Mormon's Perspective,1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,2659,"['Let', 'start', 'review', 'saying', 'am', 'active', 'Mormon', 'such', 'had', 'serious', 'reservations', 'watching', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'supporter', 'Gay', 'cause', '2', 'years', 'wavering', 'wondering', 'finally', 'got', 'up', 'courage', 'watched', 'it.It', 'rare', 'find', 'film', 'utterly', 'amazing', 'one', 'Modern', 'movies', 'tend', 'be', 'glamour', 'glitz', 'have', 'soul', 'Not', 'so', 'Latter', 'Days', 'addition', 'excellent', 'acting', 'leads', 'story', 'was', 'moving', 'intriguing', 'shook', 'core', 'left', 'tears', 'crying', 'more.What', 'Mormon', 'side', 'movie', 'Well', 'Mormon', 'was', 'not', 'offended', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'LDS', 'Church', 'True', 'Church', 'come', 'off', 'looking', 'bit', 'archaic', 'mideval', 'Mormon', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'caricatures', 'actual', 'portrayals', 'However', 'necessary', 'element', 'presenting', 'film', 'message', 'conflict', 'religious', 'homosexuals', 'face', 'beliefs', 'feelings', 'seeing', 'exaggerations', 'prejudices', 'fears', 'have', 'opportunity', 'reevaluating', 'asking', 'why', 'are', 'afraid', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different.The', 'movie', 'heterosexuals', 'understand', 'members', 'gay', 'community', 'are', 'individuals', 'own', 'feelings', 'many', 'suffer', 'conflicts', 'face', 'also', 'who', 'believe', 'moral', 'law', 'heterosexual', 'lifestyle', 'look', 'brothers', 'charity', '1', 'Cor', '13:13', 'offering', 'love', 'understanding', 'need', 'deserve', 'kind', 'love', 'Jesus', 'would', 'have', 'afforded', 'them.However', 'film', 'being', 'preachy', 'attempting', 'state', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'way', 'better', 'straight', 'lifestyle', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'heralded', 'revolutionary', 'moving', 'powerful', 'However', 'Brokeback', 'somehow', 'lacked', 'love', 'story', 'make', 'point', 'Latter', 'Days', 'however', 'more', 'Somehow', 'equate', 'film', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'trumpeting', 'forbidden', 'love', 'presenting', 'real', 'emotion', 'real', 'passion', 'yes', 'real', 'love', 'reconsider.The', 'movie', 'have', 'sex', 'nudity', 'however', 'most', 'part', 'done', 'tastefully', 'full', 'love.To', 'sum', 'thoughts', 'Latter', 'Days', 'delightful', 'movie', 'real', 'authentic', 'romance', 'will', 'leave', 'tears', 'somewhat', 'critical', 'LDS', 'Church', 'criticism', 'more', 'intolerable', 'uncharitable', 'churches', 'rather', 'direct', 'criticism', 'Mormons', 'who', 'have', 'developed', 'sense', 'Charity', 'understanding', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'offensive', 'will', 'rather', 'be', 'eye-opening']",N/A

This is a difficult question to answer under the best of circumstances, but add religion and you might want to start running for the hills now.Aaron is a good Mormon boy who loves his religion and is faithful to it.  So much so that he hides who he really is because of it.  That is until he meets the outwardly superficial and beautiful Christian. Christian is a party boy who collects conquests like other people collect stamps.  From the outside looking in these two are opposites.What brings them together is a bet Christian makes with his friends. From this bet a bond forms between the two men.

None of the characters are relatable at all. You have the (supposedly) perfect gay guy Christian (with those tweezer-shaped eyebrows...I don't think so!) The closeted, boy-next-door Morman kid, Elder. The black waitress who dreams of making it big as a grungy guitar singer?? Who are these people?This film is just an exercise in predictable Judeo-Christian bashing. If the directors/screenwriters wanted to be really ""ground-breaking"" they could make a movie criticising Islamic faith or Hinduism...but instead they play-it-safe by picking on the easy-target Christianity.This movie provides religous zealots like Jerry Falwell with more ammunition to have reason to be suspicious of gay people. I mean, the main opening scene has Christian seducing a supposed straight-man about to meet his girlfriend and the audience is meant to think ""Way to go Christian! The whole world is really gay if you liquor them up enough"".It doesn't try and suggest you can be gay and have a religous faith at the same time. Instead it uses outdated religous stereotypes (like The over-bearing, God-fearing mother or The ""yokel"" religous jock guys) to suggest you must decide whether you are going to be religous or gay. Black and white. This film really is a nasty piece of work. Even the token black characters are one-dimensional.This film also has many unexplained loopholes and random scenes that just seem spliced together with no sense of story continuity. One scene has Elder talking with Lina outside a hospital during the day...then you see Elder coming home at night all startled like he has been beaten up or something and Christian then just comes out of nowhere and is helping him back into his house? Or when Elder finds out Christian only starting hitting on him for a bet, then when they meet up again he seems to forget about this betrayal, never brings it up, and is back in love with Christian again?! The story also isn't convincing at making Elder and Christian seem in love. They only have, like, 5 scenes alone together?! The rest of the movie is Christian bitching with his catty friends? And I agree with a previous person's comment about the whole Lina side-story which doesn't really seem to go anywhere. Or the AIDS guy? He is in about 2 scenes and then Christian never mentions him again? Did he live? Did he die?This movie is just like most gay films heralded by the queer press. The main theme of the flick is the same-old-story of ""the world hates us poor gays- if only those straights were all as enlightened and sophisticated as us"".

835160,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0002I84JO,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[111, 123]","The 2003 film ""Latter Days"" was written and directed by C. Jay Cox, who is better known for having written the screenplay for the 2002 film ""Sweet Home Alabama"".  The fictional ""Latter Days"" is set in West Hollywood, California where a gay man named Christian Markelli (Wes Ramsey) lives in a small apartment complex with his female roommate, friend, coworker and aspiring singer Julie Taylor (Rebekah Johnson).  Together they work at a posh restaurant on Sunset Blvd. named Lila's, which is owned by Lila Montagne (Jacqueline Bisset).  One morning at their apartment, Christian and Julie discover that they have new neighbors in a nearby apartment in the same complex.  To their surprise, their new neighbors are a group of four Mormon missionaries and Christian is very attracted to one of them.  Due to strict Mormon missionary rules, the ""elders"" as they prefer to call themselves refrain from using their names; but after accidentally injuring himself outside, Christian learns the name of the one that he is attracted to after he comes to his aid: Aaron Davis (Steve Sandvoss).  Telling their coworkers at Lila's about the new Mormon neighbors, the coworkers make a bet with Christian (who enjoys sleeping with many different guys) as to whether or not he can seduce one of the missionaries. However, the attraction that Christian feels towards Aaron grows into much deeper feelings.  One afternoon while Christian and Aaron are alone in the missionaries' apartment, Christian and Aaron kiss.  This blatant display of gay behavior is unfortunately discovered by the other three missionaries, which include Elder Paul Ryder (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who also played Tommy Solomon on the 1996-2001 TV series ""3rd Rock from the Sun"").  When Aaron is forced to return home prematurely to face excommunication from the Mormon Church, Christian runs after Aaron and has the opportunity meet him in Salt Lake City before changing planes to return to his home in Idaho; but Aaron's self-discovery has brought great shame upon his parents, Farron Davis (Jim Ortlieb) and Gladys Davis (Mary Kay Place).  Christian dealing with Aaron's departure and Julie's subsequent success, as well as Aaron's traumatic experiences upon returning to Idaho is what makes ""Latter Days"" stand out as a truly wonderful film experience.At only 97 minutes, ""Latter Days"" is a truly wonderful film that draws the audience into its very heart-warming and emotional story.  Though some may regard the film as an attack upon the Mormon Church, the film demonstrates how difficult a journey it is for many as they travel down the path of self-discovery, often against personal beliefs, great personal anxiety, family disapprovals and popular societal expectations.  Memorable scenes include Christian's accident, Aaron talking with Lila, Aaron & Christian being discovered, Christian & Aaron in Salt Lake City, Aaron at home, Aaron's treatments, Julie's song and the closing scenes.

The writing is superb and flows from one scene to the next without a single boring moment.  Acting is absolutely fantastic.  I've never seen two straight actors play gay with such realism, passion, and vunerability.  Steve Sandvoss in particular completely blew me away.

This film has the guts to tackle a very dangerous and explosive topic.  In this case the mental and soul killing anguish some Christian churches inflict on gays and their family members.Throughout this turmoil is a driving love story that refuses to quit.  LATTER DAYS is also a very sexy film.  The actors are hot beyond belief and their chemistry is right off the scale.  Even more compelling is the age of the characters.  So many gay coming of age movies involve teenagers but that is not often the case in real life.  In this movie the characters are in their twenties with all the mature complexities that come with that age struggle.  This includes sex and yes there is a very graphic love scene but it is so beautifully shot and tastfully done that I can't see how anyone would be offended.Lastly there is how the moves ends.  Often times films go for a cotten candy sweet ending or a dark dismal finality designed to shock us.  LATTER DAYS doesn't do that.  It serves up an obtainable resolution.

Please, please, please... can we someday work toward a gay romantic comedy that doesn't involve someone dying (or attempting to die). Yes, these are real issues that gay and lesbian kids face everyday, but sometimes we also want to watch movies that just make us laugh and feel good about ourselves. (Can you imagine a suicide attempt or KS spot in ""Legally Blonde""?) This film is definitely pointed in the right direction, light years beyond the films from the 1990's, but we still have so far to go.All in all, this movie is definitely worth your time.

Not only that, but it's a great romance flick.  This one may be too much for every audience to enjoy, especially straight MORMON audiences that still follow the teachings of their gospel, or the religiously conservative.  For them, this film will feel like a stab through the heart, and a total insult.  For some, it should be a wake up call.  Mormon missionaries in gay denial do exist.  The fact that they find out on their mission: It exists too.  The fact that they finally give into it on their mission: Happens more than you think.Latter Days is a very realistic portrayal of a mormon boy who finally realizes he is gay through the help of a very special person while on his mission to convert people into the mormon religion, and it hits hard to home for me because I was raised mormon, and was in denial for the first 15 years of my life, because my religion said it was wrong and I would go to hell for it.  Thankfully, the grasps of religion no longer have their hold on me, and what you see in the film, like the torture sequences his parents end up doing on him after they find out about their son, actually really happens.  The bigotry of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is also very accurately portrayed as well.I'd recommend this film to anyone, just maybe not active mormons, you know, because you don't want one of their bishops or high priests showing up at your door asking why you trying to convert one of their members out of the church...or maybe you do?",5,"Hits close to home, and hits hard",1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,1642,"['Latter', 'Days', 'very', 'important', 'piece', 'gay', 'cinema', 'least', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'Mormonism', 'Not', 'only', 'great', 'romance', 'flick', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'straight', 'MORMON', 'audiences', 'still', 'follow', 'teachings', 'gospel', 'religiously', 'conservative', 'film', 'will', 'feel', 'stab', 'heart', 'total', 'insult', 'should', 'be', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'Mormon', 'missionaries', 'gay', 'denial', 'do', 'exist', 'fact', 'find', 'out', 'mission', 'too', 'fact', 'finally', 'give', 'mission', 'more', 'think.Latter', 'Days', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'mormon', 'boy', 'who', 'finally', 'gay', 'help', 'very', 'special', 'person', 'mission', 'convert', 'people', 'mormon', 'religion', 'hard', 'home', 'was', 'raised', 'mormon', 'was', 'denial', 'first', '15', 'years', 'life', 'religion', 'said', 'was', 'wrong', 'would', 'go', 'hell', 'Thankfully', 'grasps', 'religion', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'hold', 'what', 'see', 'film', 'torture', 'parents', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'find', 'out', 'son', 'actually', 'really', 'bigotry', 'Church', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Latter-Day', 'Saints', 'also', 'very', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'well.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'just', 'maybe', 'not', 'active', 'mormons', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'one', 'bishops', 'high', 'priests', 'showing', 'up', 'door', 'asking', 'why', 'trying', 'convert', 'one', 'members', 'church', 'maybe', 'do']",N/A

835182,A393ACL8T67DCM,B0002I84JO,R. Hays,"[42, 45]","In my opinion, this is the best gay themed movie to date. As a former Mormon missionary myself, and a gay man, the movie in many ways described my own life.  I too am from Idaho, and was excommunicated from the church.I went through the Mormon church's program that claims to change gay men, called Crossroads (an extension of Evergreen). It took me to the age of 30 to be able to accept myself the way Aaron did in the movie. I doubt he would have been able to do it in a matter of months, as portrayed, but when a gay Mormon (or a gay person of any fundamentalist right wing religion) is able to throw off the shackles that the religion places him in, and then learns to accept what he is as a good thing, that is really a beautiful thing. The movie portrayed that wonderfully.Some have criticized the movie because it didn't provide us the fate of the man with AIDS. He was not a central figure, and it has been left up to the audience to assume that Christian continued to visit him, as he would have since they became friends, or that he died. Either way, what happened to him is not important to the message of the movie.The sex scenes were done tastefully, and beautifully. It made the movie real and legitimate in a way Philadelphia wasn't. Both the lead actors played their characters flawlessly. I hope this movie boosts both their careers.I adored the Lila character too. Jacqueline Bisset played her with such class. I think every gay man would love to know a Lila...At times I felt the way Aaron's missionary companion talked was not a fair impression of what the church leadership would approve of. They would not, for example, condone him using words like ""fag,"" or ""homo."" At least not openly. But, I know from personal experience that there are many young LDS men who would use those terms themselves, and thus it wasn't a stretch for me to imagine a Mormon missionary, on his own, using that language.I really appreciated how real the portrayal of the Elders (missionaries) was. And then I learned that the writer/director of the movie was a former Mormon missionary, and can see how that came to be. I do not believe, as some have suggested, that the movie was made with the desire to bash Mormonism. I think it was made to portray the story of those of us who have had the unfortunate experience of being born gay to the Mormon subculture. That it was made to hopefully reach any young gay Mormon today to give him or her hope. The attempted suicide rate of young gay Mormons is twice that of the national figure.Mormonism teaches homosexuality is the 2nd most serious sin after Murder (a totally illogical position), and funds anti-gay initiatives all over the country. Portraying the conflict of a young gay Mormon man, and his eventual acceptance of himself, is not some underhanded or unfair way of portraying the Mormon church in regards to this issue. It was right on the money, and very fair. It is just the way it is. It is my experience with friends and relatives that anything short of glorifying Mormonism as the ""one and only true church,"" is considered bashing it. Suggesting the prophet can be wrong in his teachings of homosexuality, or any other subject, is considered persecution.To those who made the movie, and who did such a great job in the acting positions, my thanks for this story, which so closely mirrors my own.",5,A fair and accurate portrayal of Mormonism and Being Gay,1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,3358,"['opinion', 'best', 'gay', 'themed', 'movie', 'date', 'former', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'myself', 'gay', 'man', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'described', 'own', 'life', 'too', 'am', 'Idaho', 'was', 'excommunicated', 'church.I', 'went', 'Mormon', 'church', 'program', 'change', 'gay', 'men', 'called', 'Crossroads', 'extension', 'Evergreen', 'took', 'age', '30', 'be', 'able', 'accept', 'way', 'Aaron', 'did', 'movie', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'matter', 'months', 'portrayed', 'when', 'gay', 'Mormon', 'gay', 'person', 'fundamentalist', 'right', 'wing', 'religion', 'able', 'throw', 'off', 'shackles', 'religion', 'then', 'accept', 'what', 'good', 'thing', 'really', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'wonderfully.Some', 'have', 'criticized', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'fate', 'man', 'AIDS', 'was', 'not', 'central', 'figure', 'been', 'left', 'up', 'audience', 'assume', 'Christian', 'continued', 'visit', 'would', 'have', 'became', 'friends', 'died', 'way', 'what', 'happened', 'not', 'important', 'message', 'movie.The', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'done', 'tastefully', 'beautifully', 'made', 'movie', 'real', 'legitimate', 'way', 'Philadelphia', 'was', ""n't"", 'Both', 'lead', 'actors', 'played', 'characters', 'flawlessly', 'hope', 'movie', 'careers.I', 'adored', 'Lila', 'character', 'too', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'played', 'such', 'class', 'think', 'gay', 'man', 'would', 'love', 'know', 'Lila', 'times', 'felt', 'way', 'Aaron', 'missionary', 'companion', 'talked', 'was', 'not', 'fair', 'impression', 'what', 'church', 'leadership', 'would', 'approve', 'would', 'not', 'example', 'condone', 'using', 'words', 'fag', 'homo', 'least', 'not', 'openly', 'know', 'personal', 'experience', 'are', 'many', 'young', 'LDS', 'men', 'who', 'would', 'use', 'terms', 'thus', 'was', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'imagine', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'own', 'using', 'really', 'appreciated', 'how', 'real', 'portrayal', 'Elders', 'missionaries', 'was', 'then', 'learned', 'writer/director', 'movie', 'was', 'former', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'have', 'suggested', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'desire', 'bash', 'Mormonism', 'think', 'was', 'made', 'portray', 'story', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'unfortunate', 'experience', 'being', 'born', 'gay', 'Mormon', 'subculture', 'was', 'made', 'hopefully', 'reach', 'young', 'gay', 'Mormon', 'today', 'give', 'hope', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'rate', 'young', 'gay', 'Mormons', 'twice', 'national', 'figure.Mormonism', 'teaches', 'homosexuality', '2nd', 'most', 'serious', 'sin', 'Murder', 'totally', 'illogical', 'position', 'funds', 'anti-gay', 'initiatives', 'country', 'Portraying', 'conflict', 'young', 'gay', 'Mormon', 'man', 'eventual', 'acceptance', 'not', 'underhanded', 'unfair', 'way', 'portraying', 'Mormon', 'church', 'regards', 'issue', 'was', 'right', 'money', 'very', 'fair', 'just', 'way', 'experience', 'friends', 'relatives', 'anything', 'short', 'glorifying', 'Mormonism', 'one', 'only', 'true', 'church', 'considered', 'bashing', 'Suggesting', 'prophet', 'can', 'be', 'wrong', 'teachings', 'homosexuality', 'other', 'subject', 'considered', 'persecution.To', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'who', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'positions', 'thanks', 'story', 'so', 'closely', 'mirrors', 'own']",N/A

But while the fluffy script of that movie was somewhat redeemed by high production values and a star cast, he goes overboard with his dialogue here and doesn't have either the actors or the money to distract attention from some cringe-worthy chatter.That's not to say that there's nothing to like about this Mormon-boy-realizes-he's-gay-and-improves-gay-party-boy-in-the-process tale. The story is certainly touching even as the formulaic nature of it hits you over the head. And sometimes the syrupy lines Cox puts into his characters' mouths sound right, as when our Mormon missionary hero consoles a woman whose friend has died with a metaphor about the dots of ink that make up the Sunday comics, sounding utterly sincere. But when the party boy goes on a long storytelling tangent about being rescued from a cave after his father abandoned him in a snowstorm, it's a bit too much to swallow. And the coincidences that bring about the story's resolution are contrived even by formula movie standards.Again, this is more than a trashy gay movie; it has a heart and substance and a message. Its portrayal of the two lead characters is sympathetic, if a bit unrealistic, and it allows at least one of the other Mormon missionaries, (played with snarky grit by Joseph Gordon Levitt of 3rd Rock From the Sun) to show depth and dimension through his otherwise constant stream of homophobic invective.Four stars of five for effort, three for execution.

So many display stereotypical gay men or extremes in behavior, but few display the depth of emotion,love, sacrifice,and soul searching displayed in this film. This film portrays the real life day to day struggles that gay people have to deal with. There is something that everyone watching can relate to.The script is absolutely brilliant; it raises a lot of soul searching questions about the interconnectedness of all lives and living a genuine and meaningful life. It shows the havoc ,mental anquish and suffering which the intolerance of fundamentalist based religions can unleash on both families, friends and individual lives, making life sometimes unbearable. But it also shows how helpful ""alternate families"" and networks of friends can be in getting through it all.The movie displays beautifully and tastefully the first experience of genuine love between two beautiful young peoplegiving themselves unreservedly to one another. The love scene is full of the tenderness, caring and the passion of youth and soars way beyond mere sexuality. The characterizations are rich and complex and the acting by all is genuine and believable.This movie is a must see and I am very greatful to the producers and to those who made it possible.",5,AN ABSOLUTE MUST,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,1359,"['far', 'one', 'best', 'gay-related', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'So', 'many', 'gay', 'films', 'are', 'comedies', 'tragedies', 'So', 'many', 'display', 'stereotypical', 'gay', 'men', 'extremes', 'behavior', 'few', 'display', 'depth', 'emotion', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'soul', 'searching', 'displayed', 'film', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'day', 'day', 'gay', 'people', 'have', 'deal', 'something', 'everyone', 'watching', 'can', 'relate', 'to.The', 'script', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'lot', 'soul', 'searching', 'questions', 'interconnectedness', 'lives', 'living', 'genuine', 'meaningful', 'life', 'havoc', 'mental', 'anquish', 'suffering', 'intolerance', 'fundamentalist', 'based', 'religions', 'can', 'unleash', 'families', 'friends', 'individual', 'lives', 'making', 'life', 'sometimes', 'unbearable', 'also', 'how', 'helpful', 'alternate', 'families', 'networks', 'friends', 'can', 'be', 'getting', 'movie', 'displays', 'beautifully', 'tastefully', 'first', 'experience', 'genuine', 'love', 'two', 'beautiful', 'young', 'peoplegiving', 'unreservedly', 'one', 'love', 'scene', 'full', 'tenderness', 'caring', 'passion', 'youth', 'way', 'mere', 'sexuality', 'characterizations', 'are', 'rich', 'complex', 'acting', 'genuine', 'believable.This', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'am', 'very', 'greatful', 'producers', 'who', 'made', 'possible']",N/A

835189,A2GET1LJPG6FB1,B0002I84JO,"R. Quigley ""rquigl03""","[1, 1]","""Latter Days"" has many imperfections but its cuteness outweighs many of them. We follow Christian, the shallow pretty boy, who makes a bet to get one of the new Mormon missionaries living next door into bed. Hence we meet Aaron, a surprisingly insightful and tolerant Mormon. Through trial and error, Aaron eventually teaches Christian ""sex can mean something"" and is then excommunicated from his church for the ""grievous"" charge of homosexuality. What makes this movie different than some of the schlock out there is that Wesley Ramsey (Christian) and Steve Sandvoss (Aaron) lend a sense of credibility and thoughtfulness to their roles without dissolving into wimpy, simmering, self-hating gay stereotypes, even though their characters are set up that way (it doesn't hurt that they're SEXY in capital letters either).The sex scenes are erotic without being overly gratuitous and their connection is made to seem more than just skin deep. Jacqueline Bisset is a nice touch and provides the older, wiser perspective without seeming like she's lecturing everybody and the rest of the supporting cast do their jobs. There is some idiotic dialogue, side stories involving supporting players that don't matter, the obvious lip-synching roommate, and the guilt ridden, silhouetted figures of the Mormon church. I think there was a huge opportunity missed in regards to the issue of the Mormons and gays and we get glimpses of a deeper story with Aaron's mother and Aaron's ""treatment"" for his homosexuality.I found the movie appealing in its sweetness and gay-positive attitude and was eventually drawn into the idea of redemption for its two leads.

This is the story of Elder Aaron Davis, a Mormon missionary, played by Sandvoss in a loveable, warm, sincere manner. His facial expressions, his struggle to verbalize his feelings as well as the inner conflicts of reconciling who is he with what he has been taught creates a tension and provides us with a chance to care about him as a character. I'm convinced some of the questions he asks as he breaks down to Christian (Wes Ramsey) are the same ones most guys ask themselves when they try to understand their religious teachings with natural impulses and sexuality.Ramsey plays Christian as an out and proud gay waiter, comfortable with himself and his reputation as a bit of romancer. He shares his conquests with coworkers, but feels there might be more to life than his one nighters and what he types into his journal.Lest this be one-dimensional, we see a number of subplots develop with the owner of the restaurant where Christian works; an AIDS charity that feeds housebound patients; and more. Essentially all characters evolve in interesting ways.While Aaron loses his status as a Mormon, and shames his father who is portrayed as shadowy, distant and part of the Mormon hierarchy, there is a suggestion that Mom might come around eventually.The pain, physical and emotional, which Aaron experiences is real and likely occurs within this faith, as it does with many Catholics, Protestants and Jews who love and value their family and face rejection or small mindedness when they reveal their sexuality. Its important to note that in this film, Christian, no shock in the symbolism here, recognizes that Aaron might just be the perfect guy for him and worth an extra effort.The end suggests hopelessness and suddenly changes to a comforting recognition and reunion at the very end of the film.Perhaps a bit idealistic and wrapped too pretty at its conclusion, the love conquers all theme is here, but supported by a talented cast and a great amount of good acting.I've not been too specific regarding the plot for fear of ruining the experience of enjoying the story yourself.Characters played with well placed enthusiasm and genuine intensity create themes and thoughts that exist beyond the movie, providing thoughts to ponder or something interesting to discuss over coffee.

It was funny weird, thought pervoking and it left me feeling really good despite some real life situations that were not always happy.  I could identify with the mormon dude since I know well his pain having come from a strict hardcore Bible Thumping BAPTIST family myself.  Trust me ""Baptist's"" are no more accepting or tolerant of gays or gay friendly folk than the religious neanderthals seen in this movie.Despite the religious homophobic downers this was my kind of movie it had a happy ending I could honestly beleive. This movie left me happy and filled with hope.  The unrated version has the steamier sex scene but what you see is pretty tame by todays standards.  I would not recommend this movie for the kid and kinder crowd.  While not raunchy or tasteless in any way whatsoever this movie is definately for ADULT EYES ONLY!  The movie was both entertaining and quite informative.  So if you are gay, gay friendly or want to be a more humane person have a look at this movie you can not go wrong with it.

Now years later, I'm still so drawn to this film.This is the story of unlikely love and very enduring love.Wes Ramsey's character Christian is the young, worldly, city boy whose life up until meeting Steve Sandvoss's character Aaron was all about hooking up.  Aaron on the other hand, is the young, innocent Mormon from Idaho.  The characters represent two different extremes--polar opposites.Neither could continue on their current paths.  Christian was most likely on the road to self destruction while Aaron was going deeper into the closet and would most likely never let love into his life.  But Christian and Aaron meet and have some great conversations over laundry.  They grow a little closer only to be torn apart when Aaron's homosexuality is revealed.My two favorite scenes in the movie are when Christian returns Aaron's pocketwatch to Aaron's mother.  Christian thinks Aaron has committed suicide and Aaron's mom knows she is letting that lie continue.  But she runs after Christian to tell him, but it is too late.  Christian is gone.  This scene shows Aaron's mom actually has a caring side.But the highlight of the film is the ""tray dropping"" scene.

It stars Steven Sandvoss as Elder Aaron Davis (a Mormon missionary), he has been sent to L.A. to bring the word of God to the uninitiated.  He moves into an apartment opposite Christian (Wes Ramsey) who is a waiter who likes to hook up with gay men whenever possible, i.e. all the ruddy time.In a pique of post work stupidity his co workers challenge him to `turn' one of the Mormons. He has already spotted Aaron and likes what he sees and wastes very little time in `going for it'. Big problem is that whilst having many wives was ok in the Mormon religion, being with a man is absolutely verboten. This point is rammed home by a sprightly Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Elder Paul Ryder) who, as ever, puts in a short but excellent performance (see `Mysterious Skin').Whilst Christian may have been motivated by cash, it soon becomes painfully clear that he has genuine feelings for Aaron who comes across as a caring, loving and devout young man. What transpires will pull them apart and leave them guessing as to how to move on.I really enjoyed this film; it is well acted, directed and filmed and tells a very difficult story with care and compassion. C.J. Cox who both wrote and directed this has clearly done a piece straight from the heart and it shows in the attention to detail. All of the supporting actors are above good and no-one is black an d white.

Ratcliffe ""wearevinyl""","[0, 0]","Remembering seeing 'Making Love' back in the early 80's, a film which was considered the first 'gay-themed' mainstream film, 'Latter Days' takes 'Making Love' to a whole new level. And i applaud on how far filmmaking has come so far as to present 'Latter Days'. For the past few years I have heard of 'Latter Days', but didn't persue it until my recent purchase of the film on DVD.To be honest, I almost missed seeing one of the most important films about love ever made. Be it gay or straight.It has been years since i actually cried watching scenes so honest and so well-acted, that I have nothing but raves.To those who may think this is just another film aimed at the gay population filled with sex and nudity, you are wrong.If ever in your life, and if you may have the time to actually want to watch a film that not only has heart, but so many believable performances, this is one film you should not miss.The story revolves around an elder (Aaron), who during his mission away from home encounters a neighbor (Christian) who is not just friendly, but is gay. A few enchanges here and there spices the film with not only light-hearted moments, but how powerful love can be. Even if it jeopardizes one's emotions, one point stands clear. Love, no matter what, overcomes all obsticles.For one, the music for the film is so appropriate. No heavy-handed statements are evident, as each song flows perfectly with each scene.To those who may still think twice, allow me to stress how superb the performances are, from Jacqueline Bissett's touching and often humorous take as a restaurant owner to Mary Kay Place, Aaron's religious and dominating mother. Place's performance was superb. I do recommend this film highly.",5,Not your usual gay-themed film,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,1718,"['Remembering', 'seeing', ""'Making"", 'Love', 'back', 'early', '80', 'film', 'was', 'considered', 'first', ""'gay-themed"", 'mainstream', 'film', 'Days', ""'Making"", 'Love', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'i', 'applaud', 'how', 'far', 'filmmaking', 'come', 'so', 'far', 'present', ""'Latter"", 'Days', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'heard', ""'Latter"", 'Days', 'did', ""n't"", 'persue', 'recent', 'purchase', 'film', 'DVD.To', 'be', 'honest', 'almost', 'missed', 'seeing', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'films', 'love', 'ever', 'made', 'Be', 'gay', 'straight.It', 'been', 'years', 'i', 'actually', 'cried', 'watching', 'scenes', 'so', 'honest', 'so', 'well-acted', 'have', 'nothing', 'raves.To', 'who', 'may', 'think', 'just', 'film', 'aimed', 'gay', 'population', 'filled', 'sex', 'nudity', 'are', 'wrong.If', 'ever', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'time', 'actually', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'heart', 'so', 'many', 'believable', 'performances', 'one', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'miss.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'elder', 'Aaron', 'who', 'mission', 'away', 'home', 'encounters', 'neighbor', 'Christian', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'friendly', 'gay', 'few', 'enchanges', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'light-hearted', 'moments', 'how', 'powerful', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'Even', 'one', 'emotions', 'one', 'point', 'clear', 'Love', 'matter', 'what', 'obsticles.For', 'one', 'music', 'film', 'so', 'appropriate', 'heavy-handed', 'statements', 'are', 'evident', 'song', 'perfectly', 'scene.To', 'who', 'may', 'still', 'think', 'twice', 'allow', 'stress', 'how', 'superb', 'performances', 'are', 'Jacqueline', 'Bissett', 'touching', 'often', 'humorous', 'take', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Aaron', 'religious', 'dominating', 'mother', 'Place', 'performance', 'was', 'superb', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly']",N/A

If you want to see a good movie about a struggle between religious belief and being true to yourself,this is the perfect movie for you. I read the one star reviews and found some of the comments laughable. One person felt as though this movie should be based entirely on truth. This is a movie, and it is entertaining! It is well acted and touching. I watched the movie a second time with the directors commentary. He explained that he was involved, at one time, with the religion of one of the main characters. Much of the dialog and character studies are based on people he Knew and what he drew from his former life. This is not a fact based story. Some of the acting is terrific!! Watch Jacqueline Bisset, she is quite captivating.
