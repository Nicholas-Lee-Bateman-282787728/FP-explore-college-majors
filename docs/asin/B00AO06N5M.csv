The mad Russian scientist was only vaguely Russian, but that's ok. Like any good mad scientist, he loved his creations. ""You are so beautiful"" he effuses right before the Mega Queen spears him through and through. He doesn't seem to mind this, since he is so happy his experiments came to a successful end. Pretty amusing. Also, I thought there were two daughters, one of whom gets eaten in the worst possible way. No one mentioned her after, not least her parents, or any of you reviewers.  I thought that was odd. Anyway, sometimes the spiders would grow too big as they did what they do. A three foot tall spider doesn't become 6 feet tall just because it jumps on some hapless guy. We also have the incredible shrinking and the later gets bigger again Queen spider. Not good. What about the fact that the spiders were crossed with alien DNA? This would have been good to explore, but no one ever mentions it again. Since the aliens were found on a crashed spacecraft, maybe they weren't that smart after all, so their intelligence had no effect on the spiders. I dunno. On the plus side, the affection of the Mad Scientist for the spiders is almost touching. Also, the acting was ok, except for the younger daughter, who was pretty good. Too bad though that at certain moments she seemed almost casual about trying to evades angry arachnids. As I said, the film is uneven. I loved the tap-tippet-tap of little and not so little spider feet, and I'm willing to overlook the fact that spiders don't have queens. It wasn't that gory, which I liked since I'm sick of all these 'Saw' wannabe flicks that are so nasty I have to stop the movie. (I guess I'm a bit of a wimp.) Good story, ,though, and good pacing. It's good that things started slowly and then sped up gradually. It made this flick different. CGI was good too. An uneven flick, but break out the popcorn and enjoy.

1614475,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00AO06N5M,blackaciddevil,"[1, 3]","Spiders is about mutant spiders created by pieces of material from a disabled Soviet space station. New York City is threatened to be overrun and it's up to health inspector Rachel Cole & her ex to prevent the Queen Spider from uniting with her eggs and creating a full on army of five foot tall, killer spiders.I agree...why all the hate for this movie, people? You have to hand it to Director Tibor Takacs for trying his hand at some old-school creature feature type fun. For this to be his first effort in this area, I think he did quite admirably. Not only that but the 3-D was too bad at all. Sure, you can tell it was made on a limited budget but it's far from being a B-movie(by my standards, anyhow, and I've seen quite a few).However, I will admit that there are a few instances where there missed opportunities in the movie that would have put the movie above its' current status(like not having enough spider carnage going on or having a major BIG showdown with the Queen at the end). Course, with how the movie ends, there's a good possibility that we'll see a part 2 and they could do that in that movie. Given all the giant monster movies coming out over the next year or so(Jack the Giant Slayer, Pacific Rim, Godzilla..); they ought to capitalize on it...for sure...and make one.Christa Campbell, Patrick Muldoon, Willaim Hope and Sydney Campbell Sweeney put in excellent performances.

1614476,AD1E5FS892L2E,B00AO06N5M,"Brandon Blankenburg ""Author""","[6, 7]","It's a shame this movie had to have been released in theaters in this day and age. Had it come out in the 90's it would have been more well received, and typical of the creature features of the time: Lake Placid, Anaconda, Deep Blue Sea, The Relic, etc. If it had premiered on SyFy it would be considered the greatest TV movie ever. Unfortunately, neither happened, so I can easily see why it let many people down. It's a creature feature stuck in limbo. It's too good for SyFy, but not good enough to play in today's theaters. The spider effects are quite good, while the occasional digital rat would have looked OK ten years ago.The budget does not allow for the massive scale attack on the populace of New York that people were hoping for. Instead the city is evacuated before the spiders surface (at the climax) so it's just a handful of civilians and the military that are left. Judging it as a low budget typical creature feature it's great. As a theatrically released spiders-attack-New York movie from 2012 it's a major disappointment. I give it 4 stars because I like creature features, even SyFy originals, and it is better than any of the direct-to-video/made-for-TV movies I've seen. A direct-to-disc release would have turned it into a cult hit, instead of the flop it is now considered. Fans of this stuff should really give it a chance, but forget how recently it played in theaters.One thing's for sure, no one should be disappointed with the blu-ray transfer.

I have quite a collection of spider movies (crazed-insect movies in general); this one fits in with the rest.Granted, the mechanics of the plot aren't particularly fresh or new.  The story was definitely recycled from many other movies (which was quite 'green' of them: waste not want not!).  The characters weren't particularly compelling.  They served the plot and that's about it.  No one shamed themselves (although at this point, Patrick Muldoon might consider being a bit pickier with parts).  His role had him down as an ex-husband, delinquent dad of sorts.  Naturally, he had to protect his splintered family (didn't quite catch what the marital problem was, they just needed that type of dynamic and plugged it into the story: daughter in danger and all that).  The story also suffered from a stock villain, the usual culprit, some army goon lacking foresight into the habits of spiders.  The filmmakers, no doubt from desperation, also went with the whole secret conspiracy angle, something about a PROJECT that got out of hand (some mumbo jumbo about outer space, weapons, and webs).  Quarantine was evoked and some yahoos ran around killing anyone deemed to know too much..........as though a trail of bodies wouldn't be the least bit suspicious (what did they all have in common)!  What a hoot.I was definitely hesitant to buy this movie based on the spate of disgruntled reviews posted here.  Fortunately, I threw caution to the wind, decided it was a spider movie, so how bad could it be?  I'm glad I ignored the negative and went with the positive.  This movie suits me just fine.

The acting on the other hand is very, very bad as many have noted in other reviews. The lead actress just can't act. She's very bland in delivering her lines even in life and death situations. Her emotions are way off and so is her disoriented look. Her acting matches someone they might have just pulled off the street and told them ""Here...say this then look left and right."" If they had a better lead actress and a couple more weeks in editing (there are continuity issues) this flick might have been better.As for the 3D, the film itself is a conversion with an overlay of computer generated 3D effects so it is a strain on your eyes. There is very little pop-out-at-you-effects. It's mostly a depth thing.

It feels like it's one of those movies made by a committee, with no solid ambition. This is very similar to Eight Legged Freaks,except that movie's characters actually had some personalities. This was the most cardboard cast I've ever seen. Not even the lead made you care  one bit about him or his family. Yes the spiders looked cool, But it was not enough to make this show work. it was just bland.

The movie is a low budget flick for sure , and it was made in bulgaria. I would have personally have liked to see the movie take place in bulgaria and have them speak english, instead of trying to make it new york. there is a audience for films that take place in other countries as long as you have them speak english most of us english speakers will find it to be ok.  The cgi runs from very good on all the smaller space spiders to pretty good on the giant one. It's not a big budget flick though and the bulgarians did what they could. The plot about bad military dudes could have been skipped though , I would have rather seen the military as the good guys mainly. And the parts where they battle the spiders is pretty good. I would say to ignore the one star comments about bad acting and bad 3d. The acting is ok and the 3d is great on most shots.  Because they used 3d cameras for the movie!. So it's native 3d all the way. In 2d this is less a movie for sure and a standard low budgeter, but the budget was better than a saturday scy fy tv movie by some large degree. Like I said the cgi on the smaller spiders was very realistic. The big one , well it's close to sci fi channel level. Still the movie moves fast and will be a one star for non lovers of cheap sci fi flicks for sure. I don't rate sci fi and horror on the same scale as other movies. On the low budget scale of sci fi this is a three star flick. On the scale of all other movies you just can't rate it against them.  But the 3d is excellent here. The picture is good too.

1614492,ARI0VCGRLXIZF,B00AO06N5M,mmareptile,"[3, 4]",I'm really shocked at all the negitive reviews on this movie. Even more so on the 3D part. It was actually really good 3D and it was even shot in 3D!!! There were plenty of pop outs in this movie so again I'm pretty shocked at all the low reviews. This movie brings every thing it advertises. Giant spider and smaller spiders making a mess of New York....Check  Fun cheesy scifi style creature feature....double check......and fun 3D which makes this a fun view......triple check.The 3d--- as i said before the 3D in this movie was really good. Almost every scene there was a lot of depth between it's objects and there actors. There are plenty of scenes when there are people in the subway and in the apartment buildings that really gives you a good sense of how long down the halls and subway tunnels are. There are plenty of pop outs too. My girlfriend and I counted at least 14-16 pops outs which isn't bad at all for an hour twenty some thing movie. I own a lot of 3D movies and I have seen a lot worse. Safe to say My girlfriend and I were both shocked at how reviewers were saying the 3D was horrible. It was better than any of the Marvel 3d movies that were made and that is no joke either. I even lent it to two of my friends who are scifi nuts and they loved it.The movie itself is the same old scifi creature feature story really nothing new there and I won't bore you with that cause I'm sure you have probably read the description for this movie already. It wasnt a bad movie by any means and I didn't think the acting was as bad as a lot of these other reviewers were saying. Haven't they ever seen Frogs or Camel spiders!!!! (just kidding no offense to the makers of those 2 movies) Picture quality was good and so was the audio. I have a 5.1 surround sound at home and was very happy with what i got from it.Please note: I'm not hateing on the negitive reviewers on here by any means. I just dont get or see what it is they are claiming. I know 3D effcets every one a bit diffent but this movie was very solid on it's 3D. Maybe it was the way they viewed it purhaps. I watched it on my LG 47 inch 3d TV (passive style) and as said thought it was a very solid 3D movie. I urge you to go into this movie and give it a fair try. I almost didnt buy this cause of the negitive reviews and I'm glad I went ahead and bought it any way and I think most who give it a try will feel the same way.,5,"Wow, why all the hate?!!

There are little spiders that poison you and fill you with their offspring, dog-sized spiders that eat people, and a giant spider that fights tanks. All the spiders are very competent CG, and the army-versus-spider mayhem is very well realized. If you're looking for a modern take on the classic ""giant X attacks the big city"" horror films of the 50s, this is your movie, stop reading.Unfortunately Spiders falters as a film otherwise. Out of control color correction makes everything look washed out and fake, the soundtrack is laden with silly dramatic piano stings that just don't work, and the acting from stars Patrick Muldoon (most likely cast because he was in Starship Troopers) and Christa Campbell (who you might remember from cable movies you snuck downstairs to watch after your parents went to bed) is wooden and uninteresting.Your enjoyment of this film, then, depends on what you look for in movies. If you want a big campy thriller about monster spiders from space (yes, that's right, space) then you'll have a ball.

What could have possibly entered my head to make me say &#8220;hey, this movie was directed by Tibor Tak&aacute;cs, who hasn't made a watchable movie since 1987, and here we are twenty-five years later, so the obvious thing I should be doing right now is pressing play!&#8221;? I can't answer that question, but I can confidently report to you now that Spiders, Tak&aacute;cs' latest piece of celluloid garbage, as just as accomplished as such timeless Tak&aacute;cs classics as Mansquito (I actually own that one!), Ice Spiders, Mega Snake, and Meteor Storm.Plot: the Soviets have been developing something on a space station, which meets disaster thanks to a stray meteoroid. (This scene looks remarkably like the space station being destroyed in the trailer for the upcoming Sandra Bullock film Gravity, to the point where I wondered if both used the same stock footage.) A piece of it crash lands in the New York City subway system, and the NY politicos send Jason (Starship Troopers' Patrick Muldoon, whose career has unfortunately not gotten any better since 1999), a middle-management subway muckety-muck, to investigate. He finds big holes and, more alarmingly, a few dead homeless folks who don't look like they got hit with debris. He digs some eggs out of one and takes them home to his wife Rachel (Drive Angry's Christa Campbell), who conveniently happens to be a scientist. Problem is, The former-Soviet geneticist who was in charge of the project before the Union was dissolved (Blade II's Pete Lee-Wilson) and his army handler (Aliens' William Hope) want those eggs...and they will stop at nothing, including kidnapping Jason and Rachel's daughter Emily (The Ward's Sydney Sweeney) and her hot babysitter (Conan the Barbarian's Shelly Varod) to get them.If you've seen any two random Tibor Tak&aacute;cs movies since The Gate, you know exactly what to expect here. (If you haven't, more power to ya.) Braindead script, shoddy camerawork, overdramatic soundtrack, you name it. Even those rare times when Tak&aacute;cs manages to come up with crack cast members (the nadir of Ron Perlman's career was acting in Tak&aacute;cs' Rats in 2002), he manages to pull the worst performances you've ever seen out of them, so with a cast like this, you know you're going to get glimpses of cheeseball glory. Problem is, even the glory is missing from this one, it's just dreary. Dumb, predictable, not even worth watching for the terrible special effects. Give it a miss.

1614506,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00AO06N5M,Tim Janson,"[0, 1]","Films featuring giant rampaging bugs have been a staple in American cinema since the 1950s.  Playing on the paranoid, Cold War era of the time these creatures were often the result of nuclear testing gone awry.  But most of these films, certainly the best ones, were campy at their cores and they knew it.  This made them fun then and most of them remain so today.  We get no such campy fun in Spiders.  This disheveled bore-fest starts with a ridiculous premise and ends with a silly mess of a military vs. giant spider battle that makes you long for the days of films like 1955's Tarantula.A Russian satellite, launched in the 1980s and filled with venomous spiders is struck by a meteor which sends it crashing into the New York City subway.  But how a satellite filled with spiders managed to survive close to 30 years in space isn't nearly as silly as why they were put there to begin with.  Soon dozens of little spiders are crawling around and chasing the rats out of the subway and into the streets.  The section of the city where the satellite crashed is quarantined by the U.S. military under the false story of a viral outbreak.In reality the military, led by Colonel Jenkins (William Hope of Aliens), is working with a Russian scientist to harvest the eggs of the spiders, in particular the Queen.  Seems the Russians discovered an extra-terrestrial craft in the 1980s and spliced alien DNA with that of a spider and launched them into orbit because apparently the lack of gravity makes them grow when they return or some such hooey.  In any case the queen is capable of spinning an ""infinite"" amount of silk that is stronger than the most durable Kevlar and also provide stealth abilities.  Now this is never touched on again in the film and in fact on several occasions we see characters easily cut through the silk.Trapped within the quarantined area is the daughter of Jason and Rachel Cole.  He is a supervisor with the Transit Authority and she is a doctor with the Health Department.  As they try to sneak through the barriers to get through to their daughter, the spiders soon grow to massive sizes, quickly over-running the soldiers.  The queen grows even larger, Several stories tall and long as she rampages through the streets battling the army.Part of what made those 1950s fun was that the plots were simple.  Radioactivity turns bugs big...bugs go on a rampage...military kills bugs.  But Spiders mucks up that simple notion with all this silliness about alien DNA and super silk.  It's blatantly obvious the film was shot on some studio back lot.  Even though the military has quarantined several blocks the only resident seems to be the Cole's daughter.  The actors look downright embarrassed and bored to be in the production.  The CGI is the kind of quality you'd expect to find in the average SyFy channel production, i.e., bad!  For some reason the spiders seem to have these almost cartoonish faces on them.  And while the Army throws everything they have at the Queen including helicopter gunships, tanks, bazooka's and dozens of soldiers with armored weapons, they don't make a dent yet Jason Cole is able to fend her off at one point armed with nothing other than a pole.
