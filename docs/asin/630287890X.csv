I actually always thought that Malice was the most frightening of all of the Disney villians (even though this isn't Disney).  I was dissapointed that the original seven dwarves were nowhere to be seen, but their female cousins are cute and likable enough, espescially Thunderella and Critterena.  And I know everybody hates the music, but I actually thought it was pretty good, despite the cliched lyrics in some of the songs.  And the Ed Anser-voiced owl Scowl was pretty funny.  Overall this is a great movie and your kids will love it.  Very underrated.",5,"Oh, come on!",1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,701,"['Come', 'good', 'movie', 'Sure', 'Lord', 'Malice', 'cookie-cuter', 'extreme', 'animated', 'children', 'fairy', 'tale', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'actually', 'always', 'thought', 'Malice', 'was', 'most', 'frightening', 'Disney', 'villians', 'even', ""n't"", 'Disney', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'original', 'seven', 'dwarves', 'were', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'female', 'cousins', 'are', 'cute', 'likable', 'enough', 'espescially', 'Thunderella', 'Critterena', 'know', 'everybody', 'music', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'cliched', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'Ed', 'Anser-voiced', 'owl', 'Scowl', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'Very', 'underrated']",N/A

But that's okay. Muddy, Sunburn, Critterina, Marina, Blossom, Noonbeam and  Thunderella are just as good. Lord MALISS could very well be the brother of  the unamed Wicked Queen. The soundtrack is one of the best that goes with  film. I saw this when it first came out in 1993. I was seven or eight years  old then. I really loved this film then and now.
