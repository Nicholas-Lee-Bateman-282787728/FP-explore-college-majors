Watch the movie first and then do an internet search about the actual events.Director Tony Goldwyn was quoted as saying, ""I've been working on this for nine years, which is a little less than half the time Betty Anne Waters spent fighting to get her brother out of prison. So any time I started feeling bad about the ups and downs of getting a movie made, I just thought about Betty Anne's determination and my obligation to her to get this done.""What Ms. Waters did for her brother is the epitome selflessness, and she and the others who fought for justice deserve to be recognized and held in high regard for their effort and hard work. Thank God there are people and organizations like the Innocence Project who are willing to go above and beyond to exonerate the innocent and hopefully put the focus back on finding the guilty.I'll never forget when I read in the late 80's that DNA research had made a major breakthrough in helping to solve crime. It stopped a rapist in his tracks and freed a man that was innocent (despite his false confession to the crimes).",5,An moving tribute to a true story,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,1122,"['Great', 'film', 'incredible', 'cast', 'very', 'inspiring', 'story', 'Watch', 'movie', 'first', 'then', 'do', 'internet', 'search', 'actual', 'events.Director', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'nine', 'years', 'little', 'less', 'time', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'Waters', 'spent', 'fighting', 'get', 'brother', 'prison', 'time', 'started', 'feeling', 'bad', 'ups', 'downs', 'getting', 'movie', 'made', 'just', 'thought', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'determination', 'obligation', 'get', 'done', 'What', 'Ms', 'Waters', 'did', 'brother', 'epitome', 'selflessness', 'others', 'who', 'fought', 'justice', 'deserve', 'be', 'recognized', 'held', 'high', 'regard', 'effort', 'hard', 'work', 'Thank', 'God', 'are', 'people', 'organizations', 'Innocence', 'Project', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'exonerate', 'innocent', 'hopefully', 'put', 'focus', 'back', 'finding', 'guilty.I', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'when', 'read', 'late', '80', 'DNA', 'research', 'had', 'made', 'major', 'breakthrough', 'helping', 'solve', 'crime', 'stopped', 'rapist', 'tracks', 'freed', 'man', 'was', 'innocent', 'false', 'confession', 'crimes']",N/A

1404427,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B004EQAVA0,Amit Talpade,"[3, 4]","Conviction sort of marks the return to form for Hillary Swank. After a few movies featuring forgetful characters, Swank finally focuses on the roles that made her famous in the first place, the underdog who faces stiff opposition but manages to triumph after all. This is a thriller that reeks of Lifetime TV entertainment but is compelling because there are so many power performers at the game.Sam Worthington is Kenny Waters, a rowdy character who has consistently gotten in to trouble and finally is tried and convicted of false murder. The only person that believes that he is innocent is his sister Betty Ann( Swank) and she promises him that she would find a way to get him out of prison. The tale becomes interesting because Betty who is a high school dropout goes all the way to law school to become a lawyer to save her brother. Her struggle bordering on obsession is both inspiring and frightening. In reaching the goal, she loses her marriage and struggles as a parent with her two children.Conviction works because of the true life nature of the story and some fine acting. Sam Worthington, Swank and Melissa Leo act well. Minnie Driver is fine but the most surprising acting turn is by Juliette Lewis as Roseanna Perry, her performance is stunning in a brief role. The editing could have been a little tighter and at 1 hour 47 minutes of running time, things get stretched out a little bit. However, if Kenny Water could wait 18 years for justice, I am certain most viewers would not find the length tedious.

1404431,A3J0WT8I9WOBN0,B004EQAVA0,"Co-editors Nancy Gray and Dennis Field ""Co-ed...","[0, 0]","Compelling movie that holds your attention although I did find myself very annoyed with the brother Kenny's behavior and extremely annoyed with Betty Anne's years of putting her brother before her own family. I mean I understand loyalty but to me, your kids should always come first. And I felt the brother was an idiot. But then again, obviously he was played very well by the actor, Sam Rockwell. Hillary Swank was phenomenal as Betty Anne Waters as was Minnie Driver, her friend. Just wonderful.Conviction is based on a true story about Betty Anne Waters who has an extremely close relationship with her trouble-making law-breaking cocky brother Kenny. After he is sent to jail for life for murder based on circumstantial evidence(we don't know if he is innocent or not until much later in the movie), Betty Anne decides that the only way to get him out of jail is to become a lawyer. So she finishes her GED, goes to law school, and becomes his lawyer. In the process, she devotes over 15 years of her life, sacrificing her marriage and her relationship with her two boys. But oh, what I lesson those kids would learn in perseverance.As much as I admired her, I did find myself often angry with her choices. In the film, her marriage ends and her boys choose to live with their father because of her lack of attention. Yet she still puts her brother, a far less admirable character than her husband and kids, first. I didn't really understand that and I didn't really find the film explained that. The film did, however, explain their troubled childhood and how close they were. The film also doesn't explain why she chooses to connect with her brother's daughter only when she needs evidence to try to get him out of jail, after more than 15 years. I also found that the film jumped around a bit with respect to the flashbacks of the neglect that Betty Anne and her brother suffered as children. That too annoyed me.However, the performances and the moving story make the film well worth watching.

1404432,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004EQAVA0,C. Sawin,"[4, 5]","On the surface, Conviction seems like a very mixed bag. There had been little to no promotion for it out here while the trailer hadn't really been attached to any recent screenings. I do recall seeing a trailer for the film one time online months ago, but that's it. Truth be told, that's usually the best way to see a film. No scene has the chance to be overplayed because you had seen the trailer however many times. Conviction is very much an independent film and is borderline nonexistent even though it had a limited release last week. The result was not only an extremely emotional and powerful film, but Conviction also features some of the strongest performances of the year.The dramatic film jumps around in time right from the beginning. We're shown the horrific aftermath of Katharina Brow's gruesome murder and then jump back to the present day where we see Betty Anne visiting Kenneth in prison. Soon after that, we travel back into the past where we're shown the adult lives of Betty Anne and Kenneth. They're very much a part of each other's lives even when they both have families of their own to worry about. Kenneth's run ins with the law become more frequent as he seems to be picked up whenever the law is broken in Ayer, Massachusetts. Then, we jump even further back into the past during Betty Anne and Kenneth's childhood. They were very close even at that age, but they didn't live normal lives. They were stealing, trespassing, and breaking and entering at an early age. The time jumps were kind of infrequent and abrupt; they seemed to just happen at whim but provided quite a bit of background history about Betty Anne and Kenneth that was crucial to the overall story.I'm honestly not a fan of Hilary Swank. She's just never done anything for me. The main point of interest for me was Sam Rockwell. Ever since his magnificent performance in last year's Moon, I've been trying to see as many of his films as possible and they very rarely disappoint. Conviction relies on the chemistry between Swank and Rockwell though. The whole movie wouldn't be anything without the connection those two have. Swank is incredibly family driven as the aftermath of her devoting most of her life to freeing her brother takes its toll on the rest of her life and her family. Rockwell is as fantastic as ever as just a simple expression on his face seems to say more about his character than any kind of reaction could, but his emotional outbursts are just as spectacular. Before he went to prison, Kenneth Waters seemed like a family man with a warm personality that cracked a lot of jokes but flew off the handle at the drop of a hat and lost control that usually resulted in a trip downtown. Prison is tearing him apart and it shows not only in Rockwell's performance but Swank's as well.Conviction is one of the most effective dramas of the year that delivers an impact you'll be feeling long after you leave the theater. It takes you on a roller coaster of emotions that is well worth the ride. All the chips on the table lie in the hands of Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell while their on-screen presence alone seems to drive the film even when they're not saying anything. One of the best aspects of the film is that Betty Anne believes her brother is innocent and even when that comes into question, she doesn't want to hear any of it. Near the end of the film, it doesn't really seem to matter if Kenneth is innocent or not. Betty Anne believes it to be true and that's good enough for her. Her passion seems to be the underlying factor that drives the film. If you're looking for a film that feels heartfelt and genuine, then Conviction is a film you may want to look into.",4,Emotionally engaging with a powerful cast,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,3689,"['surface', 'Conviction', 'very', 'mixed', 'bag', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'promotion', 'out', 'here', 'trailer', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'been', 'attached', 'recent', 'screenings', 'do', 'recall', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'film', 'one', 'time', 'online', 'months', 'ago', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'usually', 'best', 'way', 'see', 'film', 'scene', 'chance', 'be', 'overplayed', 'had', 'seen', 'trailer', 'however', 'many', 'times', 'Conviction', 'very', 'much', 'independent', 'film', 'borderline', 'nonexistent', 'even', 'had', 'limited', 'release', 'last', 'week', 'result', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'film', 'Conviction', 'also', 'strongest', 'performances', 'year.The', 'dramatic', 'film', 'jumps', 'time', 'right', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'shown', 'horrific', 'aftermath', 'Katharina', 'Brow', 'gruesome', 'murder', 'then', 'jump', 'back', 'present', 'day', 'where', 'see', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'visiting', 'Kenneth', 'prison', 'Soon', 'travel', 'back', 'past', 'where', ""'re"", 'shown', 'adult', 'lives', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'Kenneth', ""'re"", 'very', 'much', 'part', 'other', 'lives', 'even', 'when', 'have', 'families', 'own', 'worry', 'about', 'Kenneth', 'run', 'law', 'become', 'more', 'frequent', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'whenever', 'law', 'broken', 'Ayer', 'Massachusetts', 'Then', 'jump', 'even', 'further', 'back', 'past', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'Kenneth', 'childhood', 'were', 'very', 'close', 'even', 'age', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'normal', 'lives', 'were', 'stealing', 'trespassing', 'breaking', 'entering', 'early', 'age', 'time', 'jumps', 'were', 'kind', 'infrequent', 'abrupt', 'seemed', 'just', 'happen', 'whim', 'provided', 'quite', 'bit', 'background', 'history', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'Kenneth', 'was', 'crucial', 'overall', 'story.I', ""'m"", 'honestly', 'not', 'fan', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'just', 'never', 'done', 'anything', 'main', 'point', 'interest', 'was', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Ever', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'last', 'year', 'Moon', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'see', 'many', 'films', 'possible', 'very', 'rarely', 'disappoint', 'Conviction', 'chemistry', 'Swank', 'Rockwell', 'whole', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'connection', 'two', 'have', 'Swank', 'incredibly', 'family', 'driven', 'aftermath', 'devoting', 'most', 'life', 'freeing', 'brother', 'toll', 'rest', 'life', 'family', 'Rockwell', 'as', 'fantastic', 'ever', 'just', 'simple', 'expression', 'face', 'say', 'more', 'character', 'kind', 'reaction', 'could', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'are', 'just', 'spectacular', 'went', 'prison', 'Kenneth', 'Waters', 'seemed', 'family', 'man', 'warm', 'personality', 'cracked', 'lot', 'jokes', 'flew', 'handle', 'drop', 'hat', 'lost', 'control', 'usually', 'resulted', 'trip', 'downtown', 'Prison', 'tearing', 'apart', 'not', 'only', 'Rockwell', 'performance', 'Swank', 'well.Conviction', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'dramas', 'year', 'impact', ""'ll"", 'be', 'feeling', 'long', 'leave', 'theater', 'roller', 'coaster', 'emotions', 'well', 'ride', 'chips', 'table', 'lie', 'hands', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'alone', 'drive', 'film', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'saying', 'anything', 'One', 'best', 'aspects', 'film', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'brother', 'innocent', 'even', 'when', 'question', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'matter', 'Kenneth', 'innocent', 'not', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'be', 'true', 'good', 'enough', 'passion', 'be', 'underlying', 'factor', 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'heartfelt', 'genuine', 'then', 'Conviction', 'film', 'may', 'want', 'look']",N/A
1404433,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B004EQAVA0,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Can't say that I liked or disliked Conviction. On the one hand it is an incredible film based on real events. On the other hand, the film was predictable and run of the mill.This is the story of Kenny Waters (Sam Rockwell) being convicted for murder and his sister Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) taking 12 years to get her law degree to defend him. It is a story of incredible love between brother and sister under horrible childhood circumstances. And at the same time it is a story of blind obsession that is almost toxic. Apparently this is a true story, or at least based on facts. I can't imagine Betty Anne being that possessed.The first quarter of the film is creative and done in a unique style, the director mixes up the timeline. At one moment it is the long ago past, then the present, then recent past, and then the present again. The director does an excellent job giving clear clues for the time frame. It is never confusing. But then things turn very run of the mill and the film becomes linear. I no longer had to think or pay much attention. It turned into a fairly standard melodrama at that point. For some reason I didn't care a lot about what happened to either character. They both seemed so driven to do what they did; it made no difference if I cared what happened. I just wasn't thinking, oh she's going to find that thing, yeah, she found it, I'm so happy for her. No events just happened, and then people moved on.There are moments that are hard to believe. I guess it really comes down to; truth is stranger than fiction sometimes.The film is too long at an hour and forty minutes. It would have played much better at an hour thirty. The film is rated R for language and some violence. I didn't seem anything that was really that different from an episode of Law And Order. I would guess a mature younger viewer could watch this film. Hilary Swank is convincing as Betty Anne. I liked Sam Rockwell as Kenny. And Minnie Driver is always radiant as Betty's friend. I really dislike Peter Gallagher for some reason, and really didn't care for him as the helpful lawyer Barry Scheck.

1404438,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B004EQAVA0,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","CONVICTION is a David vs. Goliath story about determination, focus, love. . .and yes, conviction.  Based on the actual wrongful murder one conviction of Kenny Waters in Massachusetts in the early 1980s, CONVICTION centers around Kenny's determined sister, Betty Anne Waters, who basically sacrifices her own personal life to exonerate her brother--a journey that will take almost twenty years.  Over the course of this film we are privy to various flashbacks of Kenny and Betty Anne as children from a dysfunctional home who have no one but each other to lean on; hence the uncommon, deep, abiding bond between them as adults.  We're also privy to Kenny's constant run-ins with the law--when his fiery temper gets the best of him--so that a kernel of doubt is placed in the viewer's mind regarding his true innocence.  And if Kenny is guilty, then Betty Anne's subsequent actions border on unhealthy obsession, which ratchets up the tension of an already tightly wound story.Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell are exemplary as Betty Anne and Kenny.  Swank is terrific depicting a Betty Anne who puts herself through law school and passes the bar to help her brother, take on the red tape bureaucracy, and lose her own family in the process.  Rockwell is completely believable as the up-and-down brother wasting his life behind bars and losing faith in his sister's ability to triumph over ""the system"".  A stunning Minnie Driver plays Abra Rice, a fellow law school student who befriends Betty Anne and helps her take on a very stubborn status quo.  Determination and sibling love are put to the test throughout CONVICTION, as there is setback after setback after setback; yet when this remarkable story finally comes to its end, you'll be hard pressed not to be loudly cheering from your seat.

This true story of a wrongful conviction and life sentence is quite compelling. The fact that Kenny Waters (Rockwell) has a criminal record and just isn't terribly likeable in many ways adds its own conviction to how a gross miscarriage of justice can and does happen. By necessity, since it details Betty Ann Waters (Swank)'s whole ordeal through law school and subsequent battles with the American legal system, it's also a bit draggy. The biggest con here is the mood of the film, rather soap operatic, with somber piano scores frequently playing in the background.

I Love Youand historical biopic in 2009'sAmelia, Hilary Swank is back in her element as Betty Anne Waters, a working-class single mother of two whose fierce loyalty to her troublemaking brother Kenny knows no bounds, in actor/director Tony Goldwyn's time-spanning, fact-based 2010 drama. Written by Pamela Gray (she and Goldwyn also collaborated on 1999's affectingA Walk on the Moon), the inspiring, potentially melodramatic plotline often borders on incredulity, but Swank's trademark iron-jawed tenacity is on full display here. At the same time, it's a primarily economic performance teetering on lunacy as her character is tightly bound to Kenny since they shared a painful childhood due to the neglect of a horrifying mother.In 1983, Kenny is convicted of the bloody murder of an elderly neighbor largely on the basis of testimony from two former girlfriends, both of whom claimed he confessed his actions to them. Neither Kenny nor Betty Anne can afford a good attorney, so she decides to become a lawyer even though she's a high school dropout. Also serving as one of the film's executive producers, Swank come back securely to the against-all-odds territory of Clint Eastwood'sMillion Dollar Baby(2004) by following Betty Anne's sixteen-year journey from her GED through college, then law school, and finally passing the bar - all while she was raising two boys and working part-time at a local pub. The ending is predictable from a mile away, but the journey is not. The introduction of DNA evidence provides a linchpin that spins the story close to Lifetime-level dramatics, especially when Betty Ann solicits the assistance of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization devoted to overturning wrongful convictions. Gray's screenplay is solid enough, and Goldwyn's direction is assured within the back-and-forth treatment of the timeline.However, it's really the acting that is aces here. Beyond Swank's sterling work, Sam Rockwell brings an unpredictable furor and a surprising vulnerability to the showier role of Kenny. His rapport with Swank never feels forced, and the devotion of their sibling relationship is what really grounds the threat of hysterics in the film. The periphery is populated by a powerful squad of actresses turning in sharply etched work - Minnie Driver as Betty Ann's law-school friend Abra, whose comic spark highlights how pivotal her character is in representing the audience viewpoint; Melissa Leo (Frozen River) as the malevolent arresting cop, whose secretive hostility provides the impetus for Kenny's conviction; Juliette Lewis as Kenny's dentally-challenged ex-girlfriend with a drunken confession scene that reveals the actress's long-forgotten raw talent below her usual giddiness; Karen Young in a brief scene as the unforgivable Mrs. Waters; and Ari Graynor (Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist) as Kenny's embittered grown daughter.

Pauzer,"[2, 2]","""Conviction"" is the story of one woman's fight to have her brother's conviction for murder overturned and have him released.A brother and sister are raised in a dysfunctional family where they receive little structure or discipline. Breaking into homes and stealing things become their barren source of amusement and excitement. It also gets the older brother in trouble with the law at an early age, but the bond between brother and sister have already been established and remains as they mature in society with the sister, Betty Ann Waters remaining within the norms of society married, raising a family and tending bar. Her brother, Kenny, played by Sam Rockwell is another matter, as he is quick to brawl and thumb his nose at society.Betty Ann Waters', played by Hillary Swank is turned upside down when her brother is convicted of a murder she is certain he did not commit. There is only one thing for her to do. She must get her high school equivalency diploma, graduate from college and law school, pass the bar and get her brother's case reopened. She manages all of these things at the expense of her marriage and alienation of her children.We see Counselor Waters struggle to get each piece of evidence to find the smoking gun that will lead to her brother's eventual release. This appeals to the audience's sense of justice and respect for the loyalty and industry shown by one sister toward her brother. Sam Rockwell plays his part as a chameleon, loving father and brother with a big heart, to the impulsive ne'er-do-well who is hard to cheer for his exoneration with the same passion, even though you feel his frustration with one setback and disappointment after another. Both bring intensity to their roles, but Rockwell is given more leeway in demonstrating his talent.Then there's Juliette Lewis who plays the ex girlfriend and current hard drinking and smoking trailer trash, who would have stolen the show if she had more script to play.  Playing a half-inebriated slob in need of dental work, you are convinced she is a pathetic character only concerned about her.  Melissa Leo also turns in a superb performance as the unrepentant cop you love to hate. Minnie Driver returns to Massachusetts from her previous role as Matt Damon's boyfriend in ""Good Will Hunting,"" becoming a friend to Betty Ann, and assisting her legally and emotionally in her quest.""Conviction"" is original and based on a true story which means, in this case, that it actually happened.

1404443,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B004EQAVA0,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 2]","... about this film, or some profound objection to it, but I don't. It's a grinder and a chopper. It grinds through the 18 years that Kenneth Waters spent in prison for a murder he didn't commit, the same eighteen years that his sister Betty Anne needed in oder to get from her GED to her law school diploma and bar exam in her relentless struggle to exonerate her brother. It chops the life story of Betty Anne into relentlessly miniscule scenes, quick cuts, editing possibly intended to reinforce the painful ADD symptoms that viewers will perceive in the acted character of Kenny Waters. The choppy editing is the likeliest reason why I and many others have found this film oddly lacking in impact. It SHOULD be a gut-wrencher/tear-jerker for some, and a fiery indictment of the class warfare called 'criminal justice' for others, but it never achieves that sort of intensity. The weakness is not in the performances of Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell as the Waters siblings; they are doggedly true to their roles, as are all of the minor characters. The unprepossessing town of Ayer, Massachusetts -- where the actual murder occurred in 1980 and the shamefully framed trail in 1983 - performs brilliantly as itself; I wonder if a town can be Oscar nominated as ""best supporting actor"". The script and the whole adaptation of the Waters story is reasonably honest and accurate in details concerning the events. But with all these virtues, it's still an ""airplane film"" in an era when fewer and fewer flights offer entertainment.The film credits the perseverance and sisterly loyalty of Betty Anne with eventual exoneration of Kenneth. I don't wish to minimize Betty Anne Waters's unquenchable devotion and determination, but the fact is that in real time it was the development of DNA-evidence technology that made the exoneration of Waters possible. Eventually, Betty Anne received the aid of New York lawyer Barry Scheck, of the ""Innocence Project"". Actress Hilary Swank, who also co-produced the film, certainly intended it as a personal, highly emotional story of a remarkable ordinary woman, so it might be unfair to criticize ""Conviction"" for missing the opportunity to make a stronger case against the death penalty (enlightened Massachusetts has no death penalty) or to stimulate awareness of 'Project Innocence' among the film-going public, but a measure or two more of social content would have made this film more satisfying for me.Project Innocence continues to campaign for the rights of the accused and the possibly wrongfully convicted. Not many wrongful conviction result from deliberate malicious malfeasance by police officers or prosecutors, as did Kenneth Waters's; most result from errors in witness testimony. Erroneous convictions are probably inevitable, but they should never be tolerated. As of 23 January 2011, 266 people previously convicted of serious crimes in the United States had been exonerated by DNA testing.

1404444,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004EQAVA0,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","CONVICTION is based on a true story, a fact that affects us in many ways: 1) that Pamela Gray created such a fine script without becoming maudlin or overbearing, 2) that a commitment and love between two abused siblings can be so strong as to overcome all odds in their rocky life, and 3) that our judicial system is so flawed that innocent people are imprisoned without a regular chance for recourse.  All of this comes together in this striking film that actor turned director Tony Goldwyn makes so compelling.Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) and her older brother Kenny (Sam Rockwell) are shown in flashbacks to have been neglected and abused children, placed in numerous foster homes by their incompetent mother (Karen Young) and the two siblings are very close, participating in pranks that eventually lead Kenny into situations that require police intervention. They both marry and have children, but Kenny is abruptly arrested one day and accused of a brutal murder and robbery by lone female police officer Nancy Taylor (Melissa Leo).  Not able to afford a lawyer Kenny is convicted on circumstantial evidence and sentenced to life without parole.  Betty Anne is devastated, convinced of Kenny's innocence, and after attempts to alter Kenny's fate she realizes the only way she can afford a lawyer is to become one. A waitress by day, this high school dropout finishes school and college and enters law school against the wishes husband Ben (Owen Campbell): Betty Anne essentially sacrifices her life (including an ultimate divorce and separation from her two boys) to become an attorney.  In law school she gains a friend in Abra Rice (Minnie Driver) and together they work to find a means to free Kenny (Kenny in desperation attempts suicide in prison and Betty Anne extracts a promise from him that he will never attempt that again or her work for him will all be in vain).Through years of investigating dead ends Betty Anne gains the support and advice from New York lawyer Barry Scheck (Peter Gallagher) who defends victims of the court system, but Betty Ann must find DNA evidence that would exonerate Kenny: the case is now 16 years old and she is told all evidence has been destroyed.  The struggle to find 'destroyed evidence' and then present that to the courts proves a near impossible task - especially when Kenny refuses to have his DNA checked 'because it may match the blood from the crime'.  Despite all impediments Betty Anne and Abra continue, uncovering startling facts that keep the story alive right to the last minute of the film.Hilary Swank is astonishingly fine as the indomitable Betty Anne as is Sam Rockwell as Kenny.  But this is a cast so well selected that there is not a weak link: rather, each actor no matter how minor their role turns in splendid performances. Juliette Lewis has a stunning cameo as a seedy ex-girlfriend of Kenny, Clea Duvall is the gritty wife of Kenny, Bailee Madison and Tobias Campbell play Betty Anne and Kenny as children, Ari Graynor as Kenny's grownup daughter Mandy, and of course the above mentioned Melissa Leo and Minnie Driver in well-developed central roles.  The film is raw, painful to watch because of the situations involved, but in the end it is one of the finest examples of the triumph of the human spirit on film.  Highly Recommended.

If you love those films too, you will enjoy this, as everything about it is compelling and believable and realistic. But it follows the same story arc as a jillion previous versions: overwhelming challenge, start to make progress, setback, more progress and and big dose of grit, family or friends who chip in enormously and sacrifice extensively, whopping, unexpected setback, confusion about the worth of the trip, final push to victory, lots of cheering.So for the utterly conventional to work, the filmmakers need to do an exceptional job of making these characters worthy of my care. My wife bought in more than I did, as did many other reviewers, so some people thought they did. I was not annoyed, not bored, not exasperated, but I certainly was always aware that we were following a map. The performances are excellent. the make-up is incredible--those folks age wonderfully. The details look good. The squalor and cheapness of the lives shown are vividly, and poignantly, drawn. So often we sit in kitchens of little houses where we seem to be able to fit 30 people. And so often they gloss over the qualities that get these people in the mess they find themselves. But not here. This is cramped, dirty living and foolish, self-destructive, and childish losers.So, lots of things work, but they could not fool me quite as much as necessary.And I wonder if this movie would have been made if Martha Coakley had won her election.

When Kenneth Waters (played by Sam Rockwell) is arrested, his family didn't believe the charges. Even through trial, they all believed in the justice system and that he'd be released. This time, the system didn't work. Betty Ann Waters, Kenny's younger sister, (played by Hilary Swank) watched as her brother was convicted for a crime he didn't do and sentenced to life in prison.What makes this story so amazing is Betty, a high school dropout, gets her GED and though it takes her over a decade, she earns her law degree in hopes of freeing her brother. The movie gives insight into her motivation and sacrifice as well as spotlighting a real life organization called The Innocence Project.I don't usually watch tearjerkers as I was sure this was going to be one. Since I'm a huge Hilary Swank fan, I couldn't resist. On a tearjerker scale of one to ten--one being no tears, this ranked about a three or four. I didn't out and out blubber like withMillion Dollar Baby. The film was high on emotion, but more on drama. Even though it has an underdog wins theme, Kenny Waters spent eighteen years of his life behind bars for a crime he didn't do. Although Betty was able to get her brother's conviction overturned, neither can be labeled a winner here. Both lost too much for that.I highly recommend this one, especially if you are a HS fan.

Their relationship was so close and intimate that there was no doubt in her mind that her brother was incapable of murder. Kenny was a self-admitted bad boy. He had been arrested so many times in their small community that when Kenny's neighbor turned up murdered it seemed to be an easy assumption that Kenny was the perpetrator of the crime.Betty Ann had no money for high-paid lawyers and when Kenny tries to kill himself in prison, she came up with a solution to their problem. She will go to college, then law school and then become a lawyer and find the evidence to set her brother free. This sound like a plot made-up in a studio office, but it is the true story of this amazing woman. And, there would be no movie, if Betty Ann's astounding story didn't have a happy ending.Telling this story is difficult. But the even script by Pamela Gray provides a good point of departure for Tony Goldwyn's direction and the moving performances by the actors. Without hesitation, Hilary Swank is definitely back, her disappointing performance as Amelia Earhart last year could have ended her trip down the red carpet to win Oscar gold forever. Her performance playing Betty Ann is subtle and convincing.  But it's not just Hilary Swank's performance that should be noted. Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Kenny Waters is amazing and heart-wrenching. His scenes in prison are remarkable as he so effortlessly depicts the wide range of emotions from complete hopelessness when years of imprisonment wear on him to utter joy when he learns that his sister has done the impossible. And lastly, Minnie Driver makes a great impression playing Betty Ann's law school friend.  It's a role that could garner attention at award time, and hopefully will lead to more roles in the future.Conviction is one of the best films of the year. It is a story of never-ending loyalty and love of a sister. It is an inspirational and uplifting film. This film will make you believe again, that with desire, perseverance and the conviction to never stop trying, almost anything is possible.The Buzz: If Sam Rockwell is not recognized during award season, it will be a shame!To see more of Kay Shackleton's reviews or film industry news see: [...]-Kay Shackleton is a film historian with focus on the Silent Film Era, see her work at [...]",5,Conviction - one of the best films of the year!,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,3145,"['Loyalty', 'something', 'expect', 'loved', 'ones', 'so', 'rarely', 'receive', 'How', 'loyal', 'would', 'families', 'be', 'were', 'convicted', 'crime', 'were', 'innocent', 'sent', 'prison', 'rest', 'lives', 'Would', 'put', 'worldly', 'away', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'see', 'injustice', 'dare', 'say', 'know', 'special', 'few', 'have', 'such', 'perseverance', 'such', 'conviction.Hilary', 'Swank', 'stars', 'film', 'so', 'aptly', 'titled', 'Conviction', 'Here', 'again', 'Swank', 'real-life', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'Waters', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'brother', 'Kenny', 'was', 'convicted', 'violent', 'murder', 'home', 'town', 'Massachusetts', 'sent', 'prison', '1983', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'Kenny', 'grew', 'up', 'dysfunctional', 'home', 'were', 'tossed', 'plethora', 'foster', 'homes', 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'only', 'family', 'had', 'was', 'other', 'relationship', 'was', 'so', 'close', 'intimate', 'was', 'doubt', 'mind', 'brother', 'was', 'incapable', 'murder', 'Kenny', 'was', 'self-admitted', 'bad', 'boy', 'had', 'been', 'arrested', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'small', 'community', 'when', 'Kenny', 'neighbor', 'turned', 'up', 'murdered', 'seemed', 'be', 'easy', 'assumption', 'Kenny', 'was', 'perpetrator', 'crime.Betty', 'Ann', 'had', 'money', 'high-paid', 'lawyers', 'when', 'Kenny', 'kill', 'prison', 'came', 'up', 'solution', 'problem', 'will', 'go', 'college', 'then', 'law', 'school', 'then', 'become', 'lawyer', 'find', 'evidence', 'set', 'brother', 'free', 'sound', 'plot', 'made-up', 'studio', 'office', 'true', 'story', 'amazing', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'astounding', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'happy', 'ending.Telling', 'story', 'difficult', 'even', 'script', 'Pamela', 'Gray', 'good', 'point', 'departure', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'direction', 'moving', 'performances', 'actors', 'hesitation', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'definitely', 'back', 'disappointing', 'performance', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'last', 'year', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'trip', 'red', 'carpet', 'win', 'Oscar', 'gold', 'forever', 'performance', 'playing', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'subtle', 'convincing', 'not', 'just', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'performance', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'portrayal', 'Kenny', 'Waters', 'amazing', 'heart-wrenching', 'scenes', 'prison', 'are', 'remarkable', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'complete', 'hopelessness', 'when', 'years', 'imprisonment', 'wear', 'utter', 'joy', 'when', 'sister', 'done', 'impossible', 'lastly', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'great', 'impression', 'playing', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'law', 'school', 'friend', 'role', 'could', 'garner', 'attention', 'award', 'time', 'hopefully', 'will', 'lead', 'more', 'roles', 'future.Conviction', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'story', 'never-ending', 'loyalty', 'love', 'sister', 'inspirational', 'uplifting', 'film', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'believe', 'again', 'desire', 'perseverance', 'conviction', 'never', 'stop', 'trying', 'almost', 'anything', 'possible.The', 'Buzz', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'not', 'recognized', 'award', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'shame', 'see', 'more', 'Kay', 'Shackleton', 'reviews', 'film', 'industry', 'news', 'see', '[', ']', '-Kay', 'Shackleton', 'film', 'historian', 'focus', 'Silent', 'Film', 'Era', 'see', 'work', '[', ']']",N/A
1404456,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004EQAVA0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[50, 53]","A sure-fire crowd pleaser, the film ""Conviction"" is based on an undeniably (and practically unbelievable) compelling true life story.  Betty Anne Waters, a high school drop-out with a troubled youth, dedicated nearly two decades of her life to clear her unjustly convicted brother of a murder charge.  She got a GED, applied and got into college, graduated law school and passed the bar, became her brother's representation and uncovered exculpatory evidence.  But despite all her best efforts, it was still quite a trial to be heard and taken seriously.  While I've thrown a lot of the film's plot at you right away, the advertising campaign already covers the same ground.  This is a movie about character and the long road to justice as seen through Betty Anne's eyes (an imposing Hilary Swank).  Far from a perfect movie, however, I'm sure audience will still embrace this--the ultimate underdog story.Swank, as I mentioned, headlines this piece with a hard edged perseverance.  She is quite believable as the matter-of-fact Betty Anne.  Sam Rockwell plays her brother, the town troublemaker, with equal parts charm and menace.  It's perhaps the film's most compelling performance and there are moments when he sinks to desperation that have real emotional resonance.  Minnie Driver befriends Swank in law school, and though their friendship is contrived at best, she becomes a welcome presence in the film.  She stands as the one truly appealing character as Swank's mania borders on selfishness and Rockwell is an unstable powder keg.  Ironically, the film wants to continuously solicit sympathy for its leads without confronting the unpleasant truths--particularly that Rockwell was a violent repeat offender whom the entire town was able to embrace as a cold blooded killer.My biggest concern about ""Conviction"" had little to do with the actual search for justice and everything to do with Betty Anne's character.  She pursues her goal steadfastly--to the ruination of her marriage and the alienation of her children.  Her conviction, as it were, has turned to obsession and every waking moment of her life in the film is dedicated to this one specific purpose.  I can't help but think that the film necessarily glosses over some of the more unpleasant aspects of this pursuit.  We get little of Swank's husband, her kids seem mildly annoyed once but are fine with their mother's lack of family focus, and there are never any concerns at work.  More telling, Swank hasn't had a relationship with her beloved brother's daughter in all the time he's been in prison.  I understand that such a relationship might have been complicated, but the film doesn't even try to explain her complete lack of concern over this family bond.  She calls her niece near the end of the film and actually says in the message-- ""you may not remember me.""  Wow!  Seems like some of her dogged determination might have been applied to other relationships as well!But, again, I don't think any of this will matter to most.  At heart, there is no escaping the facts of ""Conviction"" and they present a uniquely fascinating story.  The little guy sticking it to the man, David versus Goliath, ""never quit""--man, I'm practically cheering myself.  ""Conviction"" is a good film filled with earnest performances (a drunk Juliette Lewis is inspired) told in standard biopic format.  I don't think it digs quite far enough into the characterizations, but the story sells itself.  Fascinating, scary, frustrating, and even inspiring--the Betty Anne Waters saga was begging to be represented on the big screen!

1404462,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004EQAVA0,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Films based on actual events have pluses and minuses. The minus is that they tend to over dramatize the story they are trying to tell. The plus is that more often than not you're given a glimpse into an amazing story. The thing I've noticed with most is that the plus almost always outweighs the minus, especially since most of us are privy to the reality that was.CONVICTION is based on the real story of Betty Anne Water (played by Hillary Swank) and her brother Kenny (played by Sam Rockwell). Coming from a dysfunctional background with a mother who had numerous husbands and worked to the point she rarely had time for her children, we learn their story in flashbacks while the main issue is told in a straightforward manner. That story revolves around Kenny's arrest and conviction for the murder of an elderly woman in their town and Betty's attempt to free him for being unjustly convicted.The film opens with Kenny being picked up for questioning that he tries to laugh off. Sis comes down to pick him up when he's released and he jokes with her as well. The two are well known with the police since they were always in minor trouble when children. Kenny continued having problems but never enough to do prison time.We're presented with glimpses of their lives, how both were married and how Kenny was dedicated to his daughter. But that changes when a few months after his initial questioning while attending his grandfather's funeral, the police show and arrest him. Charged with the murder, Kenny doesn't see how he can be convicted. But testimony of two scorned women leads to a guilty decision, a move that will affect Kenny and Betty.With little or no money on hand to get a well groomed lawyer, Betty decides to go to school and get a law degree herself so that she can represent Kenny. It's slow going but she trudges through it, making a friend (Minnie Driver) in the process but almost losing her children after a divorce brought on by her obsession to see her brother free. Betty is convinced of his innocence while no one else believes.To tell whether she gets her degree or not would spoil one of the mysteries presented here. Along the way Betty also gets help from a New York lawyer who specializes in unjustly convicted individuals cases. Barry Sheck (Peter Gallagher) agrees to help her, but the case will take months unless she gets her degree and can find evidence on her own. To save her brother, Betty must get her degree at all costs and then locate and find a way to use the evidence from so long ago that will help prove his innocence.All of this takes more than two decades for her to do, but Betty never waivers. Her love for her brother is strong enough for her to do what she has to to get him released. Both she and Kenny have moments when they begin to fall, but both come back fighting.The word conviction is not meant just for the fact that Kenny was imprisoned. It also has a twofold meaning for Betty as well. First, her conviction that her brother was innocent and that she would do anything to prove this point. And secondly was her own imprisonment with her attempt to prove this point. Sacrificing her own chance at a different life, at times her own children, as she dedicates herself to his release becomes part of the story as well.The performances in this film are amazing. Swank does a stand up job as Betty, showing both her beaten down and resilient sides in a manner that is more than anything believable. But while her performance is quite good it is Rockwell that is a sight to behold.  From goofy town troublemaker to depressed prisoner, he brings off the right degree of emotion from beginning to end.Director Tony Goldwyn struggled for years to get this movie made one he heard the story. In the extras on the DVD he interviews the real Betty Anne Waters so viewers get the chance to see her as well. Sadly, Kenny was killed in a car accident shortly after his release. It's nice to see that Goldwyn was able to bring this tale to the world so everyone could see the amazing story of a woman who went through so much because she believed in and loved her brother.

But it's also been said that this film nevertheless captured the spirit of this twenty-year saga, and that definetly shows.  Playing siblings, Hillary Swank and Sam Rockwell put their all into this as Betty Anne Waters (Swank) works for twenty years to free her wrongfully-imprisoned brother, Kenny (Rockwell.)  I do think things were rushed at times, but some would argue that squeezing twenty years into a two-hour movie would be difficult.  I counter that arguement with the fact that films like Forest Gump made this technique work very well.  Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this film.  The bonded leads (temporarily bonded) are nicely complimented by the witty Minnie Driver as Betty Anne's friend in law school and beyond and the ever-optimistic Peter Gallagher as Barry Scheck, the founder of the Innocence Project.

MILLER,"[1, 3]","This film is undoubtably aimed at the conspiracy theorist who believes the word ""court"" can't exist without ""kangaroo"" before it, who think ""dirtycop"" is one word. I personally know a lot of the type--whith them it's always ""Bush"" this, ""big business"" that. Anyone who doesn't indulge their self-centeredness is the enemy. One older lady of my acquaintance recently had a grandson come around to her for drug money, and when she turned him down, he stole it from her purse while she wasn't looking. And when I'm over to their house and he's there, I have to listen to a lot of poor-me-the-world-&%$#s noise, when he's lucky Grandma didn't disown him.This film is quite honest about Kenny Waters' lifelong pattern of being a problem child from the git. He's the typical Joe Sixpack troublemaker, always in trouble with the law, always dead certain that he's the real victim when he tangles with someone. In one incident he goes after a rowdy drunk with a broken bottle when he decides the guy disrespected his baby girl, who he'd had the poor judgement of bringing to the bar with him in the first place. So when a woman is viciously murdered, the local fuzz look to him as the best suspect. He's innocent, he's being railroaded, but with his record, he makes a great patsy?The real hero here is his sister Betty Ann (Hillary Swank), who turns her own life upside down, partially neglecting her own two sons to get her big brother sprung. To the boys' credit, they eventually become her chief cheerleaders as Mom fights for an uncle they barely know. She puts herself thorough law school, and eventually brings Barry Scheck and his Innocence Project into the fray. Meanwhile, in her visits to Kenny in the Joint while she's working on his case, he proves who isn't as mature as whom by his tantrums and standard issue white trash naysaying. Most other siblings would have checked out at the gate and kept right on goin'.Okay, I get the point--the system isn't perfect and a lot of people get sent up the river who aren't guilty. But the point of this movie is that of Scheck's group and a lot of potential viewers--""the Man"" is a predator and he's out to screw the ""Little Guy"", and (sound of rifle bolt cycling) he's got us all in the crosshairs and he's COMING TO GET US, AAARGH!!! Which turns this touching story of a courageous kid sister putting it on the line to save her big brother into an us-versus-them piece of propaganda against law and order.

She was a young woman with two children, working in a bar at the time of Kenny's conviction. Instead of accepting it, she decided to study law part-time so that she could access evidence and fight the case on his behalf.The story is told with the use of a few flashbacks. The first shows us how Kenny is arrested by police officer Nancy Taylor (Leo), while others show us the relationship between Kenny and Betty Anne when they were small children. Kenny is originally cleared of suspicion, but is arrested a second time two years later. After a series of damning testimonies, he receives a life sentence.Both siblings struggle to adjust. Kenny tries to commit suicide in prison and Betty Anne almost flunks her class. She splits with her boyfriend and is dismayed when her two boys ask to live with their father because she doesn't spend enough time with them. Imagine having to give up your children in that way. Her decision to help her brother consumed her.Betty Anne is given new hope when she learns in school that DNA testing has freed other wrongly-convicted prisoners. She passes her exam and qualifies as a lawyer, enlisting the help of classmate Abra Rice (Driver) and a group specializing in freeing prisoners with the help of DNA evidence.One of the biggest problems she faces is tracking down evidence that is so old. She eventually discovers some disturbing facts about the case and fights to reveal the truth. Kenny is powerless to help, but Betty Anne gives him the courage to go on with his life. She's his inspiration.The main theme of the story is the love between a brother and sister and how it impacts each of their lives. It's an inspirational tale and Swank and Rockwell nail their roles. While all the ingredients are there to make a moving drama, something doesn't quite work.Betty Anne sacrifices so much and we should feel elated when she achieves her goal, but the setup was lacking and I wasn't completely drawn in. Maybe it's that we are never totally sure that Kenny is innocent? Or perhaps it's because all the childhood flashbacks involve scenes in which the siblings are breaking the law in some small way? Maybe it's because Swank and Rockwell are so good in other roles that I had unrealistic expectations?Video Quality 4.5/5The film looks great. Detail is sharp throughout and I couldn't detect any obvious problem with the presentation. There isn't a lot of beauty in the film as the settings were drab and grimy for the most part, but everything looks natural and real.Audio Quality 4/5The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix does everything it is supposed to. This is a story driven by dialogue and it comes across clearly in every scene. There's nothing flashy and the rear channels are used sparingly, but the track is free of any blemishes.Special Features 1/5There's just one feature included in the package and it only lasts 10 minutes. Director Tony Goldwyn talks to the real Betty Anne Waters. We learn how long it took for the film to be made and some of the problems encountered along the way. The feature includes a rather sobering fact: Kenny died in an accident just six months after being released.This is a good film. It's well-acted and easy to follow. There are some strong scenes, especially when Swank and Rockwell are on screen together. But it's not a great film, and I can only recommend it as a rental.Overall score 3.5/5",4,True story of a sister's fight to free her convicted brother,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,3947,"['Conviction', 'drama', 'biography', 'Directed', 'Tony', 'GoldwynStarring', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Melissa', 'Leo20th', 'Century', 'Fox', '|', '2010', '|', '102', 'min', '|', 'Rated', 'R', '|', 'Released', 'Feb', '01', '2011Video', 'Video', 'codec', 'MPEG-4', 'AVCVideo', 'resolution', '1080pAspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Audio', 'English', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1French', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1Spanish', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1Subtitles', 'English', 'SDH', 'SpanishDisc', 'Single', '50GB', 'Blu-ray', 'DiscThe', 'Film', '3.5/5Conviction', 'true', 'story', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'Waters', 'Swank', '18-year', 'fight', 'free', 'brother', 'Kenny', 'Rockwell', 'who', 'was', 'convicted', 'murder', 'was', 'young', 'woman', 'two', 'children', 'working', 'bar', 'time', 'Kenny', 'conviction', 'Instead', 'accepting', 'decided', 'study', 'law', 'part-time', 'could', 'access', 'evidence', 'fight', 'case', 'behalf.The', 'story', 'told', 'use', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'first', 'how', 'Kenny', 'arrested', 'police', 'officer', 'Nancy', 'Taylor', 'Leo', 'others', 'show', 'relationship', 'Kenny', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'when', 'were', 'small', 'children', 'Kenny', 'originally', 'cleared', 'suspicion', 'arrested', 'second', 'time', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'series', 'damning', 'testimonies', 'life', 'sentence.Both', 'siblings', 'struggle', 'adjust', 'Kenny', 'commit', 'suicide', 'prison', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'almost', 'class', 'boyfriend', 'dismayed', 'when', 'two', 'boys', 'ask', 'live', 'father', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'Imagine', 'having', 'give', 'up', 'children', 'way', 'decision', 'help', 'brother', 'consumed', 'her.Betty', 'Anne', 'given', 'new', 'hope', 'when', 'school', 'DNA', 'testing', 'freed', 'other', 'wrongly-convicted', 'prisoners', 'exam', 'qualifies', 'lawyer', 'enlisting', 'help', 'classmate', 'Abra', 'Rice', 'Driver', 'group', 'specializing', 'freeing', 'prisoners', 'help', 'DNA', 'evidence.One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'tracking', 'down', 'evidence', 'so', 'old', 'eventually', 'disturbing', 'facts', 'case', 'fights', 'reveal', 'truth', 'Kenny', 'powerless', 'help', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'courage', 'go', 'life', 'inspiration.The', 'main', 'theme', 'story', 'love', 'brother', 'sister', 'how', 'lives', 'inspirational', 'tale', 'Swank', 'Rockwell', 'nail', 'roles', 'ingredients', 'are', 'there', 'make', 'moving', 'drama', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work.Betty', 'Anne', 'sacrifices', 'so', 'much', 'should', 'feel', 'elated', 'when', 'goal', 'setup', 'was', 'lacking', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'drawn', 'Maybe', 'are', 'never', 'totally', 'sure', 'Kenny', 'innocent', 'perhaps', 'childhood', 'flashbacks', 'involve', 'scenes', 'siblings', 'are', 'breaking', 'law', 'small', 'way', 'Maybe', 'Swank', 'Rockwell', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'other', 'roles', 'had', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'Video', 'Quality', '4.5/5The', 'film', 'great', 'Detail', 'sharp', 'could', ""n't"", 'detect', 'obvious', 'problem', 'presentation', ""n't"", 'lot', 'beauty', 'film', 'settings', 'were', 'drab', 'grimy', 'most', 'part', 'everything', 'natural', 'real.Audio', 'Quality', '4/5The', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'mix', 'everything', 'supposed', 'story', 'driven', 'dialogue', 'across', 'clearly', 'scene', 'nothing', 'flashy', 'rear', 'channels', 'are', 'used', 'sparingly', 'track', 'free', 'blemishes.Special', 'Features', '1/5There', 'just', 'one', 'feature', 'included', 'package', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'Director', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'talks', 'real', 'Betty', 'Anne', 'Waters', 'learn', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'problems', 'encountered', 'way', 'feature', 'rather', 'sobering', 'fact', 'Kenny', 'died', 'accident', 'just', 'six', 'months', 'being', 'released.This', 'good', 'film', 'well-acted', 'easy', 'follow', 'are', 'strong', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'Swank', 'Rockwell', 'are', 'screen', 'together', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'rental.Overall', 'score', '3.5/5']",N/A
1404475,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B004EQAVA0,susannah,"[0, 0]","I know it's a true story, or I wouldn't see how this could ever happen, and many questions are not answered here.Kenny is a violent repeat criminal, particularly of burglary, with a favorite knife. A woman Kenny knows is brutally stabbed to death during armed robbery, but Betty Anne just KNOWS her brother is innocent. Not because he has any kind of alibi or proof of innocence or anything, she just knows, and stakes her entire life on it. That is love, but also major denial and obsession.  She admits once that it has occurred to her that maybe he was not innocent, but apparently only for about five minutes. At no point does she show proof that he IS innocent, such as an alibi, etc. Even after it is shown that he didn't do the actual killing, he admits that the blood could show to be his. Was he there, was he an accomplice, as was stated? This is never followed up on.Then there is Betty Anne. A high school dropout, who says one day that she is going to get her GED, then her BA, and on to law school, passing the bar on the first try. Voila! Is this woman some kind of undiscovered academic genius? Who knew it was that simple! How did she pass all the undergraduate courses? How did she pass any law school year? I am sure it is pretty rigorous, requiring literacy and major academic skills, and even for people with solid educations behind them. There are many from the top schools in the country who don't pass the bar the first time, or even the second. But Betty Anne did! It is also never said how she PAID for one day of school, while working part time at the bar, the other kind!This was just too implausible, and at the end, did proclaim Kenny to be not guilty of the murder, but I would not say Kenny was innocent. I think he had something to do with the crime, and already had a criminal record. Mandy, Kenny's daughter, who Betty Anne had apparently taken no time to get to know in all those 18 years, said she had a memory of her mother talking to her grandmother about ""her daddy's bloody shirt,"" when she was 4 or 5. Why would her mother be talking about a bloody shirt to HER mother if Kenny had nothing to do with the crime? She wasn't talking to the police or district attorney, not testifying against him, but was in the privacy of her own home, nor would she say such a thing in case anyone interviewed her daughter 18 years later.  Kenny himself said he could be shown to be involved, the DA said thee was evidence he was involved, his daughter had that memory of evidence of his involvement, yet they were shouting from the rooftops that he was innocent.I liked Minnie Driver's character, who went above and beyond to help her friend in this quest. She was the nicest, most caring,and  more interesting a character.

1404479,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B004EQAVA0,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[14, 24]","Every year, the studios release a handful of films about mentally or physically impaired people who persevere against the odds and overcome their disabilities. These usually star A-List actors who are very good and very Oscar friendly. The films are strategically released, starting in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto and maybe San Francisco. Then, as word or mouth builds, the films open in more multiplexes across the country. Why do the studios do this? The only thing a studio wants more than huge box office is multiple Oscar nominations, which can lead to more box office. When they can't find a story about someone with a physical or mental handicap, they settle for a story about the underdog who overcomes great odds.If you can look beyond the marketing machine behind these films and all cylinders are firing, you may experience some of the most memorable moments you spend in a movie theater all year.When they aren't all firing? You get films like ""Conviction"".Betty Ann Waters (Hillary Swank) and her brother, Kenny (Sam Rockwell) have basically been on their own since they were pre-teens. They use each other as a support network and remain close throughout their lives. Kenny has problems with the police and a determined female officer, Officer Taylor (Melissa Leo) pegs him for the brutal murder of an elderly woman the two Waters children frequently play pranks on. Kenny is sentenced and one appeal after another is overturned. Finally, desperate to give her brother some hope, Betty decides she will go to Law School and defend her bother. There are a few obstacles; Betty is recently married and has a young son, she never completed high school or college and the couple struggles to make ends meet. In Law School, Betty meets Abra Rice (Minnie Driver) and they become friends. When they graduate, the two women also become Kenny's last chance to get out of prison.Directed by Tony Goldwyn (the bad guy in ""Ghost"", director of a lot of television and the film ""Someone Like You"") and written by Pamela Gray (""Music of the Heart"", ""A Walk on the Moon""), ""Conviction"" is an okay film marred by some of the chunkiest storytelling I have seen on a multiplex screen in a long time.Film is a visual art form and it is difficult to do a biography well; you have to balance a certain amount of exposition (so the viewer can get to know the characters) with a lot of narrative to propel the story forward. If you have ever seen a film biography ""Conviction"" will not surprise. It follows a fairly standard formula; it begins with Betty working in a bar at night and attending law school during the day. Naturally, as she is burning the candle at both ends, we recognize she is determined to achieve a goal. Oh, and she is juggling two teenage sons from her broken marriage. During a busy night, Abra recognizes her classmate and tries to get her attention. She asks Betty why she is the ""other"" old woman in their class and this causes Betty to get a far away look in her eyes. Then, she remembers back to an earlier point in her life with her brother, giving us some back-story. When the back-story is over, we are plopped into another part of the history. Later, we shoot back to an even earlier moment in their life. Then, Betty is newly married and Kenny gets into a fight, leading to his first run in with Officer Taylor (Leo). Later, we move back again and then jump back to ""present day"".Simply watching someone gaze into the distance, leading to a memory is neither a very original or sophisticated method of introducing us to the back-story we need for this film to work. The moment in the bar doesn't work because Betty seems coerced into the memory; she is very busy and Abra seems to force herself on Betty. But as soon as she is forced to remember, boy do the memories come back.A much better example of this technique is used in Danny Boyle's ""127 Hours"". In this far better film, Franco seems mesmerized by the memory we are about to see. And when it is over, he seems affected by it. In ""Conviction"", Swank simply stares into the great beyond, her eyes blank. We never feel like she is connecting to the memory we are witnessing. If she can't get us to connect, who will?Because of all of the movement back and forth, between Betty and Kenny's childhood and their lives as adults, to the moments in ""present day"", the segments seem episodic and television like. And because there are so many segments, we never really feel the emotional impact of any of these moments. After Betty and Abra graduate, they attract the attention of Barry Scheck (Peter Gallagher). The three begin to interview people involved with the case, trying to find a new lead. When they don't get what they are looking for, Swank turns away and frowns at Driver. In the next scene, she turns away and frowns at Driver. When they finally get something useful, she turns to Driver and tries to hide her glee. Swank's Betty Ann would not be a good poker player. All of this happens on the surface and we never get beyond or below this, which is what is needed for this film to make an impression.""Conviction"" has all of the elements you would expect from such a film. Betty's two sons become involved in the case, acting as cheerleaders for her journey. You know that Betty will get her law degree despite the odds. Strangely, this moment has no emotional impact. It isn't supposed to. Everything in the film leads to Betty and Abra securing the release of Kenny. Maybe the filmmakers were afraid of diluting the perceived power of the final moments. But because we don't have the time or investment to care about anything earlier in the film, when are we supposed to care, connect or invest in any of the film?""Conviction"" is a forgettable film

1404481,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004EQAVA0,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Conviction' is one of those true stories that on the surface appear to be made for the movies. Hillary Swank plays Betty Anne Waters who went to law school, not to pursue a career but for one reason alone: free her brother who was falsely imprisoned for 18 years on the charge of first degree murder.In a series of flashbacks, we soon learn the sad story of Betty Anne's brother, Kenny, who was blamed for the murder of a local woman two years earlier, in the small town of Ayer, Massachusetts in 1980. Director Tony Goldwyn wisely doesn't sugarcoat Kenny, who has a nasty temper and is not always that likable. In one of the best scenes in the film, Kenny gets into a verbal argument with a man in a bar, while holding his infant daughter in his arms. He hands his daughter to the child's mother and then proceeds to punch the man in the face who falls to the floor; Kenny then brandishes a broken beer bottle over the fallen man's face and threatens to kill him. Soon afterward, he parades around the bar reassuring everyone that everything's okay and then gets up on the stage and moons the audience, who all appear (including sister Betty Anne) thoroughly amused.While we see in another flashback the reason why Betty Anne remains loyal to Kenny even after he's convicted of murder (as children they were painfully separated and sent to foster care), it soon becomes obvious that the discerning film goer has little reason to sympathize with the surly Kenny, except for the fact that he's an innocent man who's imprisoned for life. Sam Rockwell is quite convincing as bad boy Kenny but once he's locked up, he has little to do except have bitter conversations with his sister and occasionally tussle with the correction officer, who's in the room overseeing the siblings' jail house tte-&agrave;-tte.'Conviction' reaches its highest point of interest during the courtroom scene where the false testimony of Kenny's two ex-girlfriends along with a corrupt police officer, Sgt. Nancy Taylor (played by a steely Melissa Leo), seals his fate. Then its downhill until the denouement, where the slow pacing and awkwardness of the plot undermine the overall narrative. Ostensibly, Betty Anne went to law school singularly to free her brother. But in reality, she hardly uses any of her legal skills to get Kenny off the hook. There is no dramatic courtroom scene where Betty Anne, acting as her brother's counsel, goes toe to toe with a determined prosecutor and saves the day, presenting her closing argument to a jury. Instead, while she's in law school, she merely learns about DNA testing and Barry Scheck's Innocence Project (which she could have found out about, merely by doing some research at the local library).Betty Ann is next pitted against a series of unassuming antagonists: courtroom and police office workers who fail to put much effort into finding a box containing all the evidence from Kenny's trial. After repeated tries, Betty Ann hits pay dirt after buttering up a court clerk and running into a sympathetic police officer who remembers Kenny from his first year on the force. Betty Ann's domestic problems which include her husband leaving her and her teenage sons' decision to live with the father, are dull subplots that take us away from arriving at the happy resolution.'Conviction' picks up again when Betty Ann, accompanied by her law school buddy Abra Rice (well-played by Minnie Driver), team up with Barry Scheck and extract a signed confession from Kenny's ex-wife, who reveals that she committed perjury after Sgt. Taylor threatened to have her daughter taken away from her. After Kenny is exonerated by DNA evidence and the ex-wife's affidavit is presented in court, Kenny is released from prison. Taylor, however, cannot be tried, as the statute of limitations has run out.Much is made in the film about Kenny's reconciliation with his estranged daughter Mandy, who was not allowed to communicate with her father due to the ex-wife preventing any kind of communication between the two, while Kenny was incarcerated. In researching the true story the film was based on, I couldn't find any information about a daughter and I presume this character was invented in order to enhance the narrative.I've never been much of a fan of Hillary Swank as she has always struck me as a cold fish. Here again she's unable to exude the requisite warmth, reflective of Betty Ann's personality. On the other hand, Swank, more a driven character type, ably conveys Betty Ann's cold obsession in attempting to free her brother.'Conviction' is not always exciting or dramatic in parts and would have probably been better off as a made-for-TV movie. But it's also an interesting, offbeat tale, presumably with a happy ending, based on true events. In reality, director Goldwyn deemed it irrelevant to reveal what actually happened to Kenny in real life. Five days before 9/11 and six months after he was released from prison, while taking a short cut home, Kenny feel off a 15 foot wall, hit his head and died a couple of weeks later, with Betty Anne at his side. While the case initially brought against Kenny remains unsolved, the culprit leading to Kenny's ultimate demise is easily discerned: Bad Karma!",3,"Drama of sister's quest to have imprisoned brother

1404482,ACOBSK2BP57IR,B004EQAVA0,vishnu,"[0, 2]","One reviewer likened `Conviction' to a Lifetime movie, which seems accurate; it is anemic, lacking that Gertrude Stein Thereness.  I don't know much about the actual story, I'm not sure how much of the film differs, and so, relying only on the film, I'll say that I found Kenny to be disappointing.  I don't know what was available to him during the time he was imprisoned, but, I find it quite sleazy of him to not pursue the exact education that his sister pursued---he did, after all, have lots and lots of time to spare.  Betty Ann could have supplied him with the materials even if his prison was unable to, right?  I know, for myself, that if my sister was doing all of that for me, I'd say, ""Hey, if you have to do this, then so do I. You're not alone, we'll do this together.""Instead, Betty Ann gets the brother from hell, who seemingly sits on his *ss all day and bemoans his miserable luck.  Betty Ann must not only work, pay for high school, college, and law school educations, raise her children, and study, but she also functions as full-time mother-psychiatrist-cheerleader for a rancorous, ever difficult to please, hot-tempered caveman.  His gratitude does not compensate for his behavior.  Every time something goes wrong, little Kenny needs his endless pep talks while she's practically killing herself on the outside, oy vey.  The audience is given no reason to like Kenneth Waters, and that was sorely, sorely needed.We see Betty Ann, for the most part, perpetually concerned for her brother's low morale, which is frustrating, because he should have suppressed his impulses to moroseness and petulance, and presented a stronger, more equable front.  He should have been the paragon of comfort for his sister rather than being offensively inconsiderate; his actions are something along the lines of, `you do all the work, Betty Ann, and worry about me, sacrifice, and give me all of your attention, and I'll act out like a child.'  Meanwhile, Betty Ann seems quite okay with this, she might as well, sincerely, without sarcasm, ask Kenny at one point, ""Are we all revolving around you fast enough, Kenny?  Do you want us to jump?  We will!  Just say how high!  Please don't be upset, Kenny, I'm stressed, but your stress is superior, Kenny!  Let me comfort you!""  One wonders if Kenny is a narcissist or perhaps just of such spectacular density, that not even nearly two decades in prison could penetrate it or humble him.As for the acting, I was impressed with Swank's performance, she had some very good moments, her crying scenes were great.  The truly phenomenal acting was by Juliette Lewis, hers is a highly-nuanced performance; it's very rare to see acting that can be classified as art.The movie is fairly boring, yet, oddly, its worth watching, because its good moments really are good.",1,"Oh, I'm not good at creating titles....",1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,2815,"['One', 'reviewer', 'likened', 'Conviction', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'accurate', 'anemic', 'lacking', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'Thereness', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'actual', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'differs', 'so', 'relying', 'only', 'film', ""'ll"", 'say', 'found', 'Kenny', 'be', 'disappointing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'available', 'time', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'find', 'quite', 'sleazy', 'not', 'pursue', 'exact', 'education', 'sister', 'pursued', '-he', 'did', 'have', 'lots', 'lots', 'time', 'spare', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'could', 'have', 'supplied', 'materials', 'even', 'prison', 'was', 'unable', 'right', 'know', 'sister', 'was', 'doing', ""'d"", 'say', 'Hey', 'have', 'do', 'then', 'so', 'do', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'do', 'together', 'Instead', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'brother', 'hell', 'who', 'seemingly', '*ss', 'day', 'miserable', 'luck', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'work', 'pay', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'law', 'school', 'educations', 'raise', 'children', 'study', 'also', 'functions', 'full-time', 'mother-psychiatrist-cheerleader', 'rancorous', 'ever', 'difficult', 'please', 'hot-tempered', 'caveman', 'gratitude', 'not', 'compensate', 'behavior', 'time', 'something', 'wrong', 'little', 'Kenny', 'endless', 'pep', 'talks', 'practically', 'killing', 'outside', 'oy', 'vey', 'audience', 'given', 'reason', 'like', 'Kenneth', 'Waters', 'was', 'sorely', 'sorely', 'needed.We', 'see', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'most', 'part', 'perpetually', 'concerned', 'brother', 'low', 'morale', 'frustrating', 'should', 'have', 'suppressed', 'impulses', 'moroseness', 'petulance', 'presented', 'stronger', 'more', 'equable', 'front', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'paragon', 'comfort', 'sister', 'rather', 'being', 'offensively', 'inconsiderate', 'actions', 'are', 'something', 'lines', 'do', 'work', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'worry', 'sacrifice', 'give', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'act', 'out', 'child', 'Meanwhile', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'quite', 'okay', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'sincerely', 'sarcasm', 'ask', 'Kenny', 'one', 'point', 'Are', 'revolving', 'fast', 'enough', 'Kenny', 'Do', 'want', 'jump', 'will', 'Just', 'say', 'how', 'high', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'upset', 'Kenny', ""'m"", 'stressed', 'stress', 'superior', 'Kenny', 'Let', 'comfort', 'One', 'Kenny', 'narcissist', 'perhaps', 'just', 'such', 'spectacular', 'density', 'not', 'even', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'prison', 'could', 'penetrate', 'humble', 'him.As', 'acting', 'was', 'impressed', 'Swank', 'performance', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'moments', 'crying', 'scenes', 'were', 'great', 'truly', 'phenomenal', 'acting', 'was', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'hers', 'highly-nuanced', 'performance', 'very', 'rare', 'see', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'classified', 'art.The', 'movie', 'fairly', 'boring', 'yet', 'oddly', 'worth', 'watching', 'good', 'moments', 'really', 'are', 'good']",N/A
