How this ever fell into the hands of John Carpenter and Chevy Chase, I'll never understand.  Someone else mentioned that Harrison Ford would have been better cast as the central character and I think that's pretty much dead on but the screenplay would have to have been trashed and put in the hands of someone who wanted to create something that actually represented the original and also in the hands of a more capable director.  John Carpenter may be good at what he does but he was way out of his depth with this and was probably incapable of controlling Chase. Bottom line, the books very good if not great and the movie is a huge disappointment that really sucks.

This disk fully contains the English soundtrack (in among other languages).  While it may not have all of the bells and whistles of a US Blu-Ray release, it does appear to be the only Blu-Ray / HD version of this film out there. Why it hasn't been released on Blu-Ray in the US is anyone's guess. The transfer quality of this film is actually better than I had expected considering that this is not a US Blu-Ray release.Granted, this is not the best film ever made. Casting Chevy Chase was completely questionable considering it isn't intended to be a comedy. The chemistry between Daryl Hannah and Chevy Chase just didn't really work. And, it has its share of story flaws. But, the invisibility effects are still pretty amazing. For invisibility films, it's definitely one of the top films in that genre and definitely one of the better films to step it up for invisibility effects. The only other recent films that have done an equal job with effects isThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen [Blu-ray] andHollow Man: Director's Cut [Blu-ray].If you're looking for a high def version of this film to complete your invisibility or John Carpenter collection, this is the version to get.. at least until a US version of this movie is released to Blu-Ray.Note...I should mention that there's a big 6 printed on the front of the package. I thought that might have something to do with region encoding.  However, I was able to play this disk on my computer which had no troubles reading it. But, it's possible that some US BD players could have difficulty playing this disk if any region encoding is involved.

Here, we get to see the disadvantages of having invisibility. It may sound fun, but in real life, you'll very well regret it if you really have it. Chevy Chase moves away from the comedic genre, and gives us a pretty believable performance as the man who we can't see. Sam Neill is the antagonist that everyone would just love to hate.

313803,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6302462762,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Chevy Chase has been an interesting artist to me. I never quite know how to see him. No pun intended.Very much like Stephen Colbert, it seems to me that the man never fully exits his persona. I've never seen the ""real"" Chevy Chase. I honestly don't think many people have, including his friends. So whenever I screen a performance, I'm never quite sure how far into the role he's gotten, if at all. Sincerely doubt even he knows how much he'll get into the role.This is one of the few exceptions where he submits completely to the process - fully enveloping the character. And it's a really terrific performance.Wish he did more of these in his career.Filmed long before the term ""reboot"" came into existence, I have to say that this is one of the best of the category. Updated, not only to showcase technological advances in SFX (of that time circa 1992) but giving the story a more robust and fuller presentation; characters that are better developed and fleshed out, so to speak.In the film, Chevy plays Nick Halloway, an smarmy insincere stockbroker whose life is pretty much a shallow game of wine, women and song - nothing serious, nothing solid, nothing substantial. And in a cosmic irony, he's about to face all of those life aspects simultaneously.Sent on behalf of his investment fund to listen to a scientific company's pitch for more venture capitalization, Nick is completely out it - hung over from the previous night's alcohol-laced cavorting - he's barely awake, much less listening to the pitch. Giving up on the gathering, he quietly slips away hoping to find an office couch to sleep off the booze. Finding a private sauna in the executive suites, he's found his temporary bed.Completely zonked out, he doesn't hear the building alarm. Nor the screams of people, the mass frantic exodus for the exits, and the freakish light show that completely envelops the building.By way of an accident that he himself unintentionally triggered, and a Rube Goldbergian series of errors, Nick is caught up in a nuclear-style meltdown. A completely unexpected and unplanned effect - parts of the building seemingly vanish, leaving behind swiss cheese fragments of reality. Unfortunately, Nick is part of the cheese that's no longer ""here"".What no one knew: The company's other big investor was the Central Intelligence Agency. And the newly born invisible man has potential beyond words. Even cut apart via vivisection, the gains would be substantial. Regrettably for them, a bumbling agent's verbalized insight to that horrific scenario ends all hopes of getting Nick to voluntarily submit to their control. Understandably, he won't become their lab rat for some sick research. Or turned into an assassin as is hoped by the lead agent played to sinister perfection by the always enjoyable Sam Neill.As dark forces begin to hunt him down, he discovers a new respect for life and all it's small, seemingly insignificant pleasures. By having become intangible, he realizes that he's actually becomes more tangible. Nick is now more real and alive than he ever was, but will he live long enough to enjoy the discovery?Again, an unusual effort by Chevy. Completely believable in a fully realized movie, making this extraordinarily enjoyable. And one of those rare films that goes by so quickly, you're sad the adventure is over.Movie Notes:- The one single aspect that I didn't quite buy in the movie's logic, even though it's one of the funnier scenes, when Nick had such difficulty eating Chinese food. Immediately after my first screening, I ate noodles without seeing either the utensils or the food. It's not that difficult. Hate to make this comparison, but people suffering blindness do it every day. On the other hand, seeing the digestion process was understandably revolting. Once in your stomach, no matter how beautiful or elegant when presented as a dish, the consumed version is basically roiling vomit being processed by the body. Just sayin'.- Daryl Hannah has never been a quality actress in my opinion. Decent, sometimes bordering on pretty good; this effort was the latter. Not that this couldn't have been done by another performer, but Director John Carpenter obviously tailored the role to fit her personality - not the other way around.

313804,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,6302462762,Marshall Lord,"[2, 2]","If you have not read the book, you may well find this an adequate, reasonably imaginative, and fairly entertaining film.Unfortunately, because the excellent book of the same name by H.F. Saint (link:Memoirs of an Invisible Man) which inspired it is so superlatively brilliant, this film suffers by comparison.Tells the story of an ordinary man (Chevy Chase) who is accidentally turned invisible, but still needs to eat, drink, sleep, open doors to pass through them, etc. Government agents see him as a huge opportunity for both spying and scientific reseach. Our hero realises that if the government gets hold of him his life won't be that of a human being but a lab rat, so he goes on the run. The main plot line of the story tells of his battle to keep out of the hands of the government forces and their sinister ringleader, excellently played by Sam Neill.He also manages to set up a romance with Daryl Hannah's character.The basic idea and plot are the same in the film as in the original book. But where Saint's novel was an edgy, sexy and exciting thriller packed with very plausible ideas about how human beings might react to the presence of an invisible person, and what he might have to do to survive, the film is much lighter in tone and the story is played mostly for laughs. Which is does often get, but seeing such a dramatic book filmed as light comedy is a bit of an anticlimax.Probably one reason that the book worked so much better than the film is that invisibility is a subject more easily described by words than pictures. It was vastly easier for H.F. Saint to write about what was happening to his character than for the film to show that there was an invisible man in the room.Having said that, one or two images from the film which DID manage this well are quite unforgettable, such as Sam Neill staggering towards a door with his hand up behind his back as if an invisible person were holding it there, and a gun magically suspended beside him with the business end pressed against the side of his head. All credit to Neill for a really good bit of acting there.Overall I would have to describe this as competent but not brilliant, with some good acting from the three leads. But if you are looking for a story about an invisible man which really is brilliant, read H.F. Saint's book.

After putting this off for a while, I got told to watch it, or my budgie would die :( I mean, what's a girl to do? Lose her budgie, or sit through an hour & a half of Chevy Chase?I thought I was going to be constantly reminded of Hollow Man watching this, as it's one that I hated, just about as much as I dislike Chevy Chase. Hollow Man totally freaked me out, from Kevin Bacon sucking on the girl's nipple, to the ending. Never again. If I have to watch that movie again, it'll be too soon!The special effects were better & more subtle than Hollow Man, from the building disappearing, to Chevy smoking, and seeing the smoke in his lungs, and seeing his outline as he blew it out, or the makeup on his face! Also, when he eats, sees it, and then gets it straight back out again, and the rain scene has an almost magical feel to it.The whole movie deals with loneliness, alienation, and insanity, although I sometimes felt Chevy was wrong for the role, as was Sam Neill - I did NOT like his character at all. But I guess that was the whole point. Everyone will say this movie is a comedy due to Chevy being the main character, but it was quite a serious role for him, a big step away from his usual roles. Daryl Hannah was terrific, considering most of her intimate scenes are played to special effects. The last scenes over the end credits are especially touching, and bring a little tear to the eye!Now I've finally seen this, I'm hoping that's the last I'll hear about it!

This ambitious little 1992 film was sorely overlooked at the box office, as if it really were invisible.

This deftly-directed John Carpenter tale is really just a new spin on the ""Invisible Man"" franchise. But the story is subtly amusing, the special effects are quite impressive for the time, and of course, it has beauty Darryl Hannah and terrific actor Sam Neill as a gung-ho agent obsessed with capturing Chase for his ""secret"". The story rides on the premise of placing a regular guy in an irregular predicament as suddenly, his invisibility is wanted by all.It's no ""classic"", to be sure.
