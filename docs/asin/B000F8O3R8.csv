985596,A3QO324Z4CUNNO,B000F8O3R8,"Charles Stuckey ""stuck-fla""","[1, 1]","This was a great story, but suffered in a number of areas. I suspect some was translation, but I'm not sure. The subtitled version does make more sense, if not by a lot. It has a great theme but really fails to expound on details. The style also does not lend itself to making the story flow consistently. I would also suspect too many resources were focused on the CGI and it's integration into the animation, something which does not always happen smoothly. On the positive side the CGI apparently allowed more time for a higher quality of animation. Overall, this series looks like it was done piecemeal and stuck together in a hurry, while giving the impression at the same time that the storyline was planned and set long in advance. The closing sequence being something more fitting to a romantic comedy is a prime example of it's ""discontinuity"". The science in this science fiction is good, the fiction is well thought out, but the execution overall leaves much to be desired. It does start to make more sense the second time through though. I won't say it's not worth watching, but it requires filling in areas the story jumps (temporarily usually) and paying close attention.

985597,A1AG087O9PBNFF,B000F8O3R8,Gvaz The First,"[1, 1]","This anime is a really poor excuse for a show. To make it short and sweet, I'll list the good and bad.Good:- 3D Graphics are interesting and high quality for a DVD. The 3D animation seems a bit ""blocky"" in terms of movement, but it's overall realistic and believable.- English VA's make the best that they can of the script that is given to them, sometimes saying the exact Japanese translation ADV came up with.- Fanservice in terms of every single female has enormous breasts.- Story seems kind of new, maybe original even.- One character dies an unexpected gruesome death.Bad:- Pacing is non-existent. At one point I believe it skipped like two years, and the only way you were able to tell was a tiny snippet where it pops up and says the year. At other times, they talk of situations or reference characters as if there was two or three more hours of exposition placed on them. however, the amount of exposition actually spent ends up being a passing glance or part of one episode. Ultimately, the characters act like they're emotionally invested in other characters, whereas the viewer has not spent enough screen-time with any of the characters to care about them.- The anime is too short, as if they didn't have enough of a budget to do a full 24 episodes (yet they were able to another season of 13? Uhhh...)- 2D art is kind of lame, the designs themselves are okay, but generally everything in this anime is unable to properly convey motion in a way that is actually interesting or any sort of effort on their part.- The editing could use some work, putting a grain filter on to convey past events is pretty cheap.- You understand most of the show, up until the last few episodes where they jump right into the Sci-fi jargon and explain everything all at once that they didn't say beforehand.- Music fails to convey the elicited emotions that they expect, which I realize that at most times they try to use it as a sense of dread or shock, fails horribly. Replaying the same few tracks gets a bit old when you play it for every single situation that you feel needs it.-Panning and placement of the ""camera"" are generally poor and could have done better had they had a more competent director.Ultimately, it tries hard to be a sci-fi show that just falls hard on it's face from either budget issues or an incompetent director.If I didn't get this for $10 before shipping, I would have gotten ripped off.",2,Absolutely Mediocre,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,2412,"['anime', 'really', 'poor', 'excuse', 'show', 'make', 'short', 'sweet', ""'ll"", 'list', 'good', 'bad.Good', '3D', 'Graphics', 'are', 'interesting', 'high', 'quality', 'DVD', '3D', 'animation', 'bit', 'blocky', 'terms', 'movement', 'overall', 'realistic', 'believable.-', 'English', 'VA', 'make', 'best', 'can', 'script', 'given', 'sometimes', 'saying', 'exact', 'Japanese', 'translation', 'ADV', 'came', 'up', 'with.-', 'Fanservice', 'terms', 'single', 'female', 'enormous', 'breasts.-', 'Story', 'kind', 'new', 'maybe', 'original', 'even.-', 'One', 'character', 'unexpected', 'gruesome', 'death.Bad', 'Pacing', 'non-existent', 'one', 'point', 'believe', 'skipped', 'two', 'years', 'only', 'way', 'were', 'able', 'tell', 'was', 'tiny', 'snippet', 'where', 'year', 'other', 'times', 'talk', 'situations', 'reference', 'characters', 'was', 'two', 'three', 'more', 'hours', 'exposition', 'placed', 'however', 'amount', 'exposition', 'actually', 'spent', 'up', 'being', 'passing', 'glance', 'part', 'one', 'episode', 'Ultimately', 'characters', 'act', ""'re"", 'emotionally', 'invested', 'other', 'characters', 'viewer', 'not', 'spent', 'enough', 'screen-time', 'characters', 'care', 'them.-', 'anime', 'too', 'short', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'budget', 'do', 'full', '24', 'episodes', 'yet', 'were', 'able', 'season', '13', 'Uhhh', '2D', 'art', 'kind', 'lame', 'designs', 'are', 'okay', 'generally', 'everything', 'anime', 'unable', 'properly', 'convey', 'motion', 'way', 'actually', 'interesting', 'sort', 'effort', 'part.-', 'editing', 'could', 'use', 'work', 'putting', 'grain', 'filter', 'convey', 'past', 'events', 'pretty', 'cheap.-', 'understand', 'most', 'show', 'up', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'where', 'jump', 'right', 'Sci-fi', 'jargon', 'explain', 'everything', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'beforehand.-', 'Music', 'convey', 'elicited', 'emotions', 'expect', 'realize', 'most', 'times', 'try', 'use', 'sense', 'dread', 'shock', 'horribly', 'Replaying', 'same', 'few', 'tracks', 'bit', 'old', 'when', 'play', 'single', 'situation', 'feel', 'needs', 'it.-Panning', 'placement', 'camera', 'are', 'generally', 'poor', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'had', 'had', 'more', 'competent', 'director.Ultimately', 'hard', 'be', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'just', 'hard', 'face', 'budget', 'issues', 'incompetent', 'director.If', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', '10', 'shipping', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'ripped', 'off']",N/A
985598,A32DXRH18Z24ER,B000F8O3R8,Joshua Miles,"[2, 3]","I understand that there are people who like this show and that's great but in my opinion this show was horrible. If you have never seen it before DO NOT BUY THIS. Find a way to watch a couple of episodes first. I will honestly say that I am really not so sure if I liked the story from Divergence Eve or not. I was too horrified by the terrible animation to really get the gist of the plot, but I do remember enough to know that I didn't care for the story line Misaki Chronicles at all. But to be blunt about the whole thing the CG animations portions seemed like they were a last minute decision to tack on. And the characters were horrible, the only character that didn't have gigantic, out of proportion, pointy, bouncy(and I mean they go crazy...like flying all over for the whole show) breasts and was female was the like 12 year old android. Now don't get me wrong here, I have no problem at all with enjoying some fan service every now and again, but this was ridiculous. You can't even count it as fan service because apparently the artist has never seen a real live woman before in his life. The breasts look so ridiculously over-sized and misshapen that I gave this away to my buddy who pretty much only likes anime for the fan-service....He threw it away. So if you care about things like the animation, and how well drawn it was. You might want to think twice, but like I said that is my opinion...rent it and see if you can make it through 3 episodes without wanting to use the discs as weapons against its creators then make your decision.",1,Really didn't do it for me.,1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,1554,"['understand', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'show', 'great', 'opinion', 'show', 'was', 'horrible', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'DO', 'NOT', 'BUY', 'THIS', 'Find', 'way', 'watch', 'couple', 'episodes', 'first', 'will', 'honestly', 'say', 'am', 'really', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'liked', 'story', 'Divergence', 'Eve', 'not', 'was', 'too', 'horrified', 'terrible', 'animation', 'really', 'get', 'gist', 'plot', 'do', 'remember', 'enough', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'story', 'line', 'Misaki', 'Chronicles', 'be', 'blunt', 'whole', 'thing', 'CG', 'animations', 'portions', 'seemed', 'were', 'last', 'minute', 'decision', 'tack', 'characters', 'were', 'horrible', 'only', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'gigantic', 'proportion', 'pointy', 'bouncy', 'mean', 'go', 'crazy', 'flying', 'whole', 'show', 'breasts', 'was', 'female', 'was', 'like', '12', 'year', 'old', 'android', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'here', 'have', 'problem', 'enjoying', 'fan', 'service', 'now', 'again', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'count', 'fan', 'service', 'apparently', 'artist', 'never', 'seen', 'real', 'live', 'woman', 'life', 'breasts', 'look', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'over-sized', 'misshapen', 'gave', 'away', 'buddy', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'anime', 'fan-service', 'threw', 'away', 'So', 'care', 'things', 'animation', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'might', 'want', 'think', 'twice', 'said', 'opinion', 'rent', 'see', 'can', 'make', '3', 'episodes', 'wanting', 'use', 'discs', 'weapons', 'creators', 'then', 'make', 'decision']",N/A
985599,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B000F8O3R8,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","DIVERGENCE EVEIn the 2300's, interstellar travel takes place using ""inflation gates"". These gates use wormholes to pass through different dimensions. Through these wormholes, an enemy called a ""GHOUL"" comes into our world. A group of female pilots has arrived at the space station Watcher's Nest to complete their pilot training. Among them is Misaki Kureha, who lost her father in an accident at watchers nest over 10 years ago. She has come there to learn the truth. The general public isn't aware of the GHOULS. So when the new pilots encounter them, they are very surprised. Misaki learns that they are the reason her father died, and that she has a strange connection to them.This series has good animation, and a pretty well thought out plot. The CG animation for the battle scenes is not bad. I do think that the GHOULS and the thing that Misaki turns into are kinda dumb looking. Their battles are very slow moving and odd looking. The soundtrack is very unique and not bad. There is also a lot of fan service and some nudity. The downfalls of this series are the relatively uninteresting characters, and the failure to background them. The characters have potential, but we never really get to know them, not even our heroine, Misaki. It was hard to get attached to them b/c you never get know anything about who they are as people. There were some moments that were supposed to be dramatic, but they never capitalized. Most of this series was spent with the science officer and a big shot jerk talking vaguely about Misaki's potential powers. It didn't ever develop into anything memorable. I think this series was mediocre in every aspect. It's not bad, but you're probably not going to tell your friends about it, or invite them over to watch it with you.

Divergence Eve is an excellent anime.Inroduction to Divergence EveIn the 24th century, intergalatic space travel has become a reality. One of the first outposts in the far reaches of space is Watcher's Nest- an inflation hole drive portal, which had recently come under attack by a mysterious force. A group of young female cadets assigned to the portal (Watcher's Nest) are unexpectedly thrown into a hornet's nest of trouble as they finalize their training to become elite pilots in the Seraphim Squadron.Sum of the Story (No Spoilers)The story is about six girls that are in a station in space. There are six girls station in Watcher's Nest (the stations name). The six girls names are Luxandra Frail, Suzanna Bluestein, Kiri Marialate, Kotoko-01 (She's a robot), Lyar Van Ertiana and finally Misaki. As they approach Watcher's Nest, The cadets are finally advances in their training and become elite pilots. As their training advances, the cadets did not know what they are going to be fighting in space. The military didn't mention anything to them. What is the real reason of Watcher's Nest?The Setting takes place in 2317, in space. As you watch the anime, the story will unfold and you will start to understand the story a little bit more. The story picks up slow i will warn you, but trust me it picks up when you keep on watching the anime. It may seem confusing at first, but keep an eye of the expressions of the characters and what they have to say.The Case is a thinpack that comes with three discs. Each with seperate case. The bad thing is that there are only two extras.. One ADV previews and language settings (English and Japanese subtitles). It can fit into small places, so putting the anime somewhere won't be a problem.The pros of this anime- Awesome storyline, The personality of the characters are good, the detail of the anime is awesome (especially when the girls are in space) For the fans, Yes there is some nudity in the anime. The opening theme song is great (personally i like the opening theme)The music in this anime is awesome! It fits perfect when something is going to happen. It also sets the mood and will get you chills.The cons- The first episode has clips of the second to last ending which ruins the whole thing. After that, the story will unfold and will keep you guessing. Again the first episode, in the beginning, there is no talking for like 5 mintues. No it's not a defective disc, ADV films decide to have no talking in the beginning. After that, people will start talking. The boobs could have been a little smaller. They just are too big. For a fanservice, it does a good job.I would recommend this anime to mature viewers. Yes there are some scenes of nudity and therefore recommend the age of 16+. There is alot of action and a little bit of horror.This anime will make you keep on guessing until the very end (even though you might know what will happen at the end) but still watch the anime as the girls struggle to protect Watcher's Nest. Buy the anime!)Also, There is a second season of Divergence Eve. It's called Misaki Chronicles.

This was because the series has been hammered due to its extremely well endowed female leads. To be hoenst the only series I know of with women that are even in the same league being Eiken an eihii series. I thought I knew what I was in for when I popped in the first disc. Mainly being a show more concerned about showing panties and cleavage then story line and such. However I was pleasantly surprised. Divergence Eve is actually a really good series.One last thing before my actual review. Divergence Eve outside of jiggle shots, which there is no opportunity lost for, it only has the normal amount of fan fair. Meaning on two or three shots of a character naked and maybe one or two pantie and braw shots. In fact doesn't take a few chances for fan fair.And finally my review. Yes I know it took me awhile. firts and most importantly Divergence Eve has an interesting story line that keeps you guessing and wondering what is actually going on. The characters, though mostly beautiful women (no complaints there), are actually rather human and likeable. Voice acting is some of the better I've heard. The music is good and well suited to the series. The animation outside of the mechs is really good, smooth, fluid and realistic.Now to the bad parts. Well first complaint that comes to mind is that for the first five minutes of the series there is no talking, lips are moving but no ones talking. This leaves you wondering is you got defective disc. Second is that the first episode shown is actually the second to last, which kills a great deal of suspense and serves to severely confuse. Next would have to be the rather lack of an actual end forcing you to buy the sequel series to find out what happens. Lastly major flaw is the mech designs, the doable I guess they look plain and quiet frankly dorky in this day and age especial compared with the baddies which look spectacular. In the end I would suggest buying this series as it is worth the money.Before I go a review of the actual box set itself. The box set is one of ADV's new thin pack packages. Best thing about the box set is the cases are small and don't take up much space. The box for the case is sturdy and well made with nice art work. But that's really all the good things I can say about the box set. In the end I wouldn't recommend getting the box set, like most of the thin box sets. Why you ask? Well for a simple reason is ADV goes threw each disc and removes all of the extra content with the exception of a few trailers on the first disc. This means the textless opening and closings, cast interviews, insert pages even the reversible covers are all gone which sucks big time. So if you have the money use it to buy the disc separately and keep the extras it'll cost you a little extra but I think its worth.",4,Not what I was expecting,1164931200,"12 1, 2006",2006,2914,"['start', 'review', 'let', 'say', 'picked', 'up', 'Divergence', 'Eve', 'hoping', 'add', 'nice', 'fan-service', 'anime', 'library', 'was', 'series', 'been', 'hammered', 'due', 'extremely', 'well', 'endowed', 'female', 'leads', 'be', 'only', 'series', 'know', 'women', 'are', 'even', 'same', 'league', 'being', 'Eiken', 'eihii', 'series', 'thought', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'popped', 'first', 'disc', 'Mainly', 'being', 'show', 'more', 'concerned', 'showing', 'panties', 'cleavage', 'then', 'story', 'line', 'such', 'However', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Divergence', 'Eve', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'series.One', 'last', 'thing', 'actual', 'review', 'Divergence', 'Eve', 'jiggle', 'shots', 'opportunity', 'lost', 'only', 'normal', 'amount', 'fan', 'fair', 'Meaning', 'two', 'three', 'shots', 'character', 'naked', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'pantie', 'braw', 'shots', 'fact', ""n't"", 'take', 'few', 'chances', 'fan', 'fair.And', 'finally', 'review', 'Yes', 'know', 'took', 'awhile', 'firts', 'most', 'importantly', 'Divergence', 'Eve', 'interesting', 'story', 'line', 'guessing', 'wondering', 'what', 'actually', 'going', 'characters', 'though', 'mostly', 'beautiful', 'women', 'complaints', 'there', 'are', 'actually', 'rather', 'human', 'likeable', 'Voice', 'acting', 'better', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'music', 'good', 'well', 'suited', 'series', 'animation', 'mechs', 'really', 'good', 'smooth', 'fluid', 'realistic.Now', 'bad', 'parts', 'Well', 'first', 'mind', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'series', 'talking', 'lips', 'are', 'moving', 'ones', 'talking', 'wondering', 'got', 'defective', 'disc', 'Second', 'first', 'episode', 'shown', 'actually', 'second', 'last', 'great', 'deal', 'suspense', 'serves', 'severely', 'confuse', 'Next', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'rather', 'lack', 'actual', 'end', 'forcing', 'buy', 'sequel', 'series', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Lastly', 'major', 'flaw', 'mech', 'designs', 'doable', 'guess', 'look', 'plain', 'quiet', 'frankly', 'dorky', 'day', 'age', 'especial', 'compared', 'baddies', 'look', 'spectacular', 'end', 'would', 'suggest', 'buying', 'series', 'money.Before', 'go', 'review', 'actual', 'box', 'set', 'box', 'set', 'one', 'ADV', 'new', 'thin', 'pack', 'packages', 'Best', 'thing', 'box', 'set', 'cases', 'are', 'small', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'up', 'much', 'space', 'box', 'case', 'sturdy', 'well', 'made', 'nice', 'art', 'work', 'really', 'good', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'box', 'set', 'end', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'box', 'set', 'most', 'thin', 'box', 'sets', 'Why', 'ask', 'Well', 'simple', 'reason', 'ADV', 'threw', 'disc', 'extra', 'content', 'exception', 'few', 'trailers', 'first', 'disc', 'textless', 'opening', 'closings', 'cast', 'interviews', 'insert', 'pages', 'even', 'reversible', 'covers', 'are', 'gone', 'big', 'time', 'So', 'have', 'money', 'use', 'buy', 'disc', 'separately', 'keep', 'extras', ""'ll"", 'cost', 'little', 'extra', 'think', 'worth']",N/A
985606,A27TO1YTYEA9E2,B000F8O3R8,"Ugur Galatali ""Legolord""","[2, 2]","I'm kind of indecisive about this series.  I mean, there is a great story, and even greater potential than just 13 episodes, yet it is handled so badly, now even 13 episodes is too much.The reason they start the show with the second to last episode is to hook you to the series by showing the part with the most action.  First thing you have to know is, this series is a story driven anime, not action driven. What I mean is, there is not much action in this series.  This is partly due to computer generated Mecha and Creature designs.  Their movements feel very limited and clumsy, thus action is also feels very limited.Next in line is fan service.  Well, I like it if it fits the series, like Agent Aika, mmm.  This series has a serious tone, yet from the scene one boobs started to jiggle stupidly unnatural. With a plot like this they didn't even need any fan service but I guess makers of this series didn't have much confidence in their story, which, by the way is a shame.Animation is very nice and colorful, and characters are drawn nicely, although, as mentioned above, unnecessarily well equiped.  Only thing troubled me was the lack of detail in the background, it's almost nonexistent.I have to say, this series has one of the best plots I have seen in recent animes but it's put together so badly that I wouldn't recommend it to a serious animefan.  I guess in the wrong hands even the most valuable gems turns into a rock.",3,"Good story, poor execution",1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,1438,"[""'m"", 'kind', 'indecisive', 'series', 'mean', 'great', 'story', 'even', 'greater', 'potential', 'just', '13', 'episodes', 'handled', 'so', 'badly', 'now', 'even', '13', 'episodes', 'too', 'much.The', 'reason', 'start', 'show', 'second', 'last', 'episode', 'hook', 'series', 'showing', 'part', 'most', 'action', 'First', 'thing', 'have', 'know', 'series', 'story', 'driven', 'anime', 'not', 'action', 'driven', 'What', 'mean', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'series', 'partly', 'due', 'computer', 'generated', 'Mecha', 'Creature', 'designs', 'movements', 'feel', 'very', 'limited', 'clumsy', 'thus', 'action', 'also', 'feels', 'very', 'limited.Next', 'line', 'fan', 'service', 'Well', 'like', 'series', 'Agent', 'Aika', 'mmm', 'series', 'serious', 'tone', 'yet', 'scene', 'one', 'boobs', 'started', 'jiggle', 'stupidly', 'unnatural', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'fan', 'service', 'guess', 'makers', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'confidence', 'story', 'way', 'shame.Animation', 'very', 'nice', 'colorful', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'nicely', 'mentioned', 'unnecessarily', 'well', 'equiped', 'Only', 'thing', 'troubled', 'was', 'lack', 'detail', 'background', 'almost', 'nonexistent.I', 'have', 'say', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'plots', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'animes', 'put', 'together', 'so', 'badly', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'serious', 'animefan', 'guess', 'wrong', 'hands', 'even', 'most', 'valuable', 'gems', 'rock']",N/A
