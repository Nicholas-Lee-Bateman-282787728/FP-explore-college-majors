He was noble class when human.  He has Flawless Looks, a Warrior's Spirit, Rock Star Confidence, and Hypnotic Ability. He is nearly 500 years old, and very protective of Vicky.Vicky is a an ex-cop, who became a private investigator. Her eye condition cost her the police career. In the first season she was nearly sacrificed to a demon. This left her permanently linked to the demon, by magical tattoos. The experience and tattoos have her marked, she's outside of normal life. The power in her tattoos draw the supernatural to her regularly.Coreen's goth lifestyle makes her an amusing sidekick and her obsession with the supernatural makes her a valuable one. She brings youthful vitality and enthusiasm to the show.Mike was Vicky's partner and lover when she was still a cop. He never stopped loving her.

1263732,A1PAHNIKLRVGP1,B002DLB1H0,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I had been watching this on TV and found myself drawn to it. It has a bit of romance but it dosn't quite quench a vampire fan's thirst for love. The main characters are Vicki, Mike and Henry. Henry is nearly 500 years old and Vicki is a P.I. that he is attracted to. They end up working together on supernatural cases and though Henry is reluctant to get involved in anything not associated with him, he agrees to help Vicki.It is obvious that Henry really likes Vicki, but the season falls short of a satisfying ending. Both season one and two show Vicki is attracted to Henry, but they never seem to go through with their desires. The triangle b/t Vicki, her previous partner Mike, and Henry is a constant tease. She doesn't end up choosing, ever! In a way, I ended up bitter towards her for taking such opportunities for granted. Henry gets closest to having her, but she still rejects him in some physical and verbal ways.The entire season seemed to be focused on Henry and Vicki's friendship and the possibility of it becoming more. Leaving Henry hanging leads Henry to inviting Vicki to move with him. It is aggravating to watch her struggle with such a decision and end up in tears while a demon leaves the room in a human body. The demon tells Vicki he will see her again. Why ponder on the decision to go to a safer place? The last episode of season two will doubtlessly get viewers to try the books. Since there is no third season, the books are all viewers are left with to fill in the gaps.The episodes are much darker and occasionally bloody compared to season one. There isn't as much ""fun"" to it. Its more like a horror/supspence movie. I was disappointment with the cut offs of some good scenes that seem to end abruptly.The dvd pictures were good, but I really think season one and two could have been put together in one packet. The front cover is not very appealing either.",4,A New Vampire adventure,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,1892,"['had', 'been', 'watching', 'TV', 'found', 'drawn', 'bit', 'romance', 'dos', ""n't"", 'quite', 'quench', 'vampire', 'fan', 'thirst', 'love', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Vicki', 'Mike', 'Henry', 'Henry', 'nearly', '500', 'years', 'old', 'Vicki', 'P.I', 'attracted', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'together', 'supernatural', 'cases', 'Henry', 'reluctant', 'get', 'involved', 'anything', 'not', 'associated', 'help', 'Vicki.It', 'obvious', 'Henry', 'really', 'Vicki', 'season', 'short', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'show', 'Vicki', 'attracted', 'Henry', 'never', 'seem', 'go', 'desires', 'triangle', 'b/t', 'Vicki', 'previous', 'partner', 'Mike', 'Henry', 'constant', 'tease', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'choosing', 'ever', 'way', 'ended', 'up', 'bitter', 'towards', 'taking', 'such', 'opportunities', 'granted', 'Henry', 'closest', 'having', 'still', 'physical', 'verbal', 'ways.The', 'entire', 'season', 'seemed', 'be', 'focused', 'Henry', 'Vicki', 'friendship', 'possibility', 'becoming', 'more', 'Leaving', 'Henry', 'hanging', 'Henry', 'inviting', 'Vicki', 'move', 'aggravating', 'watch', 'struggle', 'decision', 'end', 'up', 'tears', 'demon', 'room', 'human', 'body', 'demon', 'Vicki', 'will', 'see', 'again', 'Why', 'ponder', 'decision', 'go', 'safer', 'place', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'doubtlessly', 'get', 'viewers', 'try', 'books', 'third', 'season', 'books', 'are', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'fill', 'gaps.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'much', 'darker', 'occasionally', 'bloody', 'compared', 'season', 'one', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'more', 'horror/supspence', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointment', 'cut', 'offs', 'good', 'scenes', 'seem', 'end', 'abruptly.The', 'dvd', 'pictures', 'were', 'good', 'really', 'think', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'together', 'one', 'packet', 'front', 'cover', 'not', 'very', 'appealing']",Blood Ties: Season 2

1263739,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B002DLB1H0,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[60, 60]","The center of ""Blood Ties"" has always been the love triangle between PI Vicky Nelson, cop Mike Celucci, and vampire Henry Fitzroy.But that love triangle starts constricting painfully in the second season of ""Blood Ties,"" which finishes the all-too-short horror/mystery series. The plots are solid whodunnits and thrillers that center around strange supernatural beasties and items, and the trio of lead actors are excellent (particularly the striking Kyle Schmid). The one problem is the ending -- it's a big fat ""to be continued"" that leaves you craving a wrap-up TV movie.When a wealthy man is brutally killed, Mike (Dylan Neal) knows he has the right suspect, a sneering woman who was at the crime scene. The problem is, the man died from being savaged by a giant cat -- and Mike saw her eyes glow when she was upset. So Vicki (Christina Cox) and Henry (Schmid) start investigating the woman's home and her family -- and uncover an ancient family secret and a tragic loss.Among the other cases they handle: creepy art and men drowned with oil paint, a mysterious box that sticks Vicki in a time loop, a Goth club being threatened by a strange drug and insect attacks, a gang of truckjackers accidentally let loose an Incan mummy, and a murderer who suddenly changes his story (claiming psychic visions). And Henry unexpectedly seeks Mike's help when another vampire starts killing in his territory... leading to a reunion with the slinky Christina, his ex-lover/vampire-mother, who's got a nasty problem that is more than it seems.Unfortunately, all this supernatural stuff is slowly crumbling away Mike's professional credibility, and the relationship between the three of them is getting increasingly tense. When an old demonic enemy returns to attack Coreen, Vicki must depend on both men to help -- but it may not be enough.""Blood Ties Season Two"" is in some ways darker and more desperate than the first season, now that Vicki has gotten totally immersed in the world of the supernatural (and Mike is starting to sink in too). But the core of the series is much the same -- it still sticks to the monster/artifact-of-the-week formula (""Talismans don't kill people; people kill people""), and maintains that distinctly dark, grimy feel, with lots of pale light, shadowy urban streets and a very unusual vampire.And the murky mysteries are nicely speckled with gritty action sequences, monsters both typical (werethingies!) and unique (bug demons!), and some painfully bittersweet moments, such as the tragic fate of an out-of-control, self-loathing vampire. But the writers keep things tongue-in-cheek, and have some wonderfully quirky dialogue (""Don't you have a lucky shirt or socks?"" ""I have a bonnet that Anne Boleyn gave me right before she tried to poison me. I'm still here, so I guess you could call that lucky"").The biggest problem with ""Blood Ties Season Two""? The ending. It's abundantly clear that there was a third season intended that would dealt with the myriad hanging plot threads -- namely the fractured love triangle and the whole Astaroth problem -- but it never happened. So the ending is depressing and unsatisfying. Come on, make us a TV movie!Kyle Schmid actually steals the limelight in this season -- Henry becomes a more passionate, tragic figure as he deals with some of his past demons, while thankfully maintaining his sexy-trickster attitude (after admitting that he likes Celucci, he adds, ""I'm gonna regret having to draw him being eaten by hellhounds""). And he pulls off even potentially-cheesy scenes, such as when Henry describes to the half-blind Vicki how luminous and vibrant the world looks to him.But Christina Cox and Dylan Neal still hold their own -- Vicki seems more at peace with her new ""night life"" and the crimes she has to investigate, but her emotional life is even more snarled than it was before. She's getting pulled in two directions, and it now hurts. And Mike is slowly coming to terms with Henry's presence -- and evens seems buddyish once or twice. But the slow destruction of his career and his nice comfortable life is a painful thing to watch.""Blood Ties Season Two"" has an unsatisfactory finale, but it's still a solid fantasy/horror/mystery series that is one of the better vampire shows to make it to TV. Definitely give it a watch.",4,"Vicky Nelson, vampire wrangler",1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,4303,"['center', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'always', 'been', 'love', 'triangle', 'PI', 'Vicky', 'Nelson', 'cop', 'Mike', 'Celucci', 'vampire', 'Henry', 'Fitzroy.But', 'love', 'triangle', 'constricting', 'painfully', 'second', 'season', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'all-too-short', 'horror/mystery', 'series', 'plots', 'are', 'solid', 'whodunnits', 'thrillers', 'center', 'strange', 'supernatural', 'beasties', 'items', 'trio', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'striking', 'Kyle', 'Schmid', 'one', 'problem', 'ending', 'big', 'fat', 'be', 'continued', 'craving', 'wrap-up', 'TV', 'movie.When', 'wealthy', 'man', 'brutally', 'killed', 'Mike', 'Dylan', 'Neal', 'right', 'suspect', 'sneering', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'crime', 'scene', 'problem', 'man', 'died', 'being', 'savaged', 'giant', 'cat', 'Mike', 'saw', 'eyes', 'glow', 'when', 'was', 'upset', 'So', 'Vicki', 'Christina', 'Cox', 'Henry', 'Schmid', 'start', 'investigating', 'woman', 'home', 'family', 'ancient', 'family', 'secret', 'tragic', 'other', 'cases', 'handle', 'creepy', 'art', 'men', 'drowned', 'oil', 'paint', 'mysterious', 'box', 'Vicki', 'time', 'loop', 'Goth', 'club', 'being', 'threatened', 'strange', 'drug', 'insect', 'attacks', 'gang', 'truckjackers', 'accidentally', 'let', 'loose', 'Incan', 'mummy', 'murderer', 'who', 'suddenly', 'story', 'claiming', 'psychic', 'visions', 'Henry', 'unexpectedly', 'Mike', 'help', 'when', 'vampire', 'killing', 'territory', 'leading', 'reunion', 'slinky', 'Christina', 'ex-lover/vampire-mother', 'who', 'got', 'nasty', 'problem', 'more', 'seems.Unfortunately', 'supernatural', 'stuff', 'slowly', 'crumbling', 'away', 'Mike', 'professional', 'credibility', 'relationship', 'three', 'getting', 'increasingly', 'tense', 'When', 'old', 'demonic', 'enemy', 'returns', 'attack', 'Coreen', 'Vicki', 'must', 'depend', 'men', 'help', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Season', 'Two', 'ways', 'darker', 'more', 'desperate', 'first', 'season', 'now', 'Vicki', 'gotten', 'totally', 'immersed', 'world', 'supernatural', 'Mike', 'starting', 'sink', 'too', 'core', 'series', 'much', 'same', 'still', 'monster/artifact-of-the-week', 'formula', 'Talismans', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'people', 'people', 'kill', 'people', 'distinctly', 'dark', 'grimy', 'feel', 'lots', 'pale', 'light', 'shadowy', 'urban', 'streets', 'very', 'unusual', 'murky', 'mysteries', 'are', 'nicely', 'speckled', 'gritty', 'action', 'sequences', 'monsters', 'typical', 'werethingies', 'unique', 'bug', 'demons', 'painfully', 'bittersweet', 'moments', 'such', 'tragic', 'fate', 'out-of-control', 'self-loathing', 'vampire', 'writers', 'keep', 'things', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'have', 'wonderfully', 'quirky', 'dialogue', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lucky', 'shirt', 'socks', 'have', 'bonnet', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'gave', 'right', 'tried', 'poison', ""'m"", 'still', 'here', 'guess', 'could', 'call', 'lucky', '.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Season', 'Two', 'ending', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'was', 'third', 'season', 'intended', 'would', 'dealt', 'myriad', 'hanging', 'plot', 'threads', 'namely', 'fractured', 'love', 'triangle', 'whole', 'Astaroth', 'problem', 'never', 'happened', 'ending', 'depressing', 'unsatisfying', 'Come', 'make', 'TV', 'movie', 'Kyle', 'Schmid', 'actually', 'limelight', 'season', 'Henry', 'more', 'passionate', 'tragic', 'figure', 'past', 'demons', 'thankfully', 'maintaining', 'sexy-trickster', 'attitude', 'admitting', 'Celucci', ""'m"", 'gon', 'regret', 'having', 'draw', 'being', 'eaten', 'hellhounds', 'off', 'even', 'potentially-cheesy', 'scenes', 'such', 'when', 'Henry', 'half-blind', 'Vicki', 'how', 'luminous', 'vibrant', 'world', 'him.But', 'Christina', 'Cox', 'Dylan', 'Neal', 'still', 'hold', 'own', 'Vicki', 'more', 'peace', 'new', 'night', 'life', 'crimes', 'investigate', 'emotional', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'snarled', 'was', 'getting', 'pulled', 'two', 'directions', 'now', 'Mike', 'slowly', 'coming', 'terms', 'Henry', 'presence', 'buddyish', 'once', 'twice', 'slow', 'destruction', 'career', 'nice', 'comfortable', 'life', 'painful', 'thing', 'watch', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Season', 'Two', 'unsatisfactory', 'finale', 'still', 'solid', 'fantasy/horror/mystery', 'series', 'one', 'better', 'vampire', 'make', 'TV', 'Definitely', 'give', 'watch']",Blood Ties: Season 2

So I'd like to give the Lifetime network zero stars for canceling this really well done show.The casting for this show was really great. Kyle Schmid is one of our heart throbs now. And I think the woman who played the medical examiner is my all-time favorite medical examiner on TV. Christina Cox was also well chosen. I've read all the books and I think she makes a great Vicki.The show itself was suspenseful and usually had comedic overtones that I enjoyed. This DVD set is well worth the price, even though there are only 9 episodes and no special features. That was a disappointment. But its all worth it to watch Henry, especially when he goes all vampire. They did his vampire teeth (and overall look) right. His canines and second incisors extend and his forehead does not get bumpy and his veins do not pop all out.

The actors knew what kind of show they were in and it felt like they were having fun as they played their roles.  I adored Christina Cox as Vicki Nelson.  She was was warm, down to earth, and very funny.  Of course I loved Kyle Schmid as Henry Fitzroy.  He's gorgeous and a good actor for someone so young playing someone so old.  He carried himself with such confidence and elegance.  He played his fangs well through his sexy cockiness, romantic sense, and comic timing.  There was that little bit of sadness that played through him, too.  It made me want to know  more about his world.  How did he come through the ages and survive so well?  Nice touch his being a dark graphic novel writer. Dylan Deal, as Mike, brought a beautiful balance.  He's so handsome and a bit of tortured white knight.  Considering he wants Vicki as much as Henry does.  I enjoyed how the show solved murder mysteries and balanced the love triangle.  Very fun!  We should have gotten to know the TV shows take on how those sigil symbols on Vicki's wrists worked.
