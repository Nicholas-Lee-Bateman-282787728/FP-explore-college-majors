This film is warm, funny and delightful. Durban even gets to do a few beautiful songs that are worked into the story in a natural way. This is really a very funny comedy with many fine moments that will leave you smiling when it's over.Jonathan Reynolds (Charles Laughton), an irracible, rich and socially prominent tycoon, is on his death bed. His son Jonathan Jr. (Robert Cummings) rushes home from Mexico with his new fiance Gloria (Margaret Tallichet) to see him before he dies, an event the papers can't wait for. But when the old man wants to meet young Jonathan's bride to be, she and her hideous mother have left the hotel to go shopping. A desparate Jonathan  talks coat check girl Anne Terry (Deanna Durbin) into pretending to be Gloria for $50.00. It is money she needs for train fare back to Shelbyville because she is abandoning her dreams of singing stardom, which are going nowhere.A teary eyed Anne has a warm and instant connection with old man Jonathan, who adores her and makes an unexpected recovery thanks to her charm and warmth. This causes complications for Jonathan, who has to catch Anne at the train station twice in order to keep the charade going! The interplay between the two as they start bickering about it is priceless. Even when the old man overhears them and knows the truth he goes along because he can see she's the right girl for his son Jonathan Jr., and the daughter-in-law he wants.Of course, Jonathan Jr. still thinks he wants to marry the real Gloria and there is a subplot about a party which will be attended by Stokowski and Heifetz, friends of the old man. Anne may finally get her chance to be noticed. But she is too sweet to go through with it and plans on returning home to Shelbyville, prompting the wise old Jonathan to hatch up a little plan of his own.A night on the town where a delightful Durbin teaches Laughton to do the Conga in a swank nightclub is a particular highlight of this stellar film. Deanna's tearful rendition of ""Goin' Home"" is another. There is also an hilarious fight scene with Durbin and Cummings chasing each other all over the place that involves biting and pinching which will surely leave you on the floor!This is one of Durbin's best films. She had a flair for light comedy and a warmth and sincerity to her acting. You can't miss this one if you love Durbin or enjoy a great comedy. This is a classy production and a chance to see for yourself the always wonderful Deanna Durbin, always and forever, ""The Last Rose of Summer.""",5,A Funny and Charming Classic,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,2670,"['Deanna', 'Durbin', 'was', 'always', 'fabulous', 'outing', 'nice', 'script', 'fine', 'support', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'making', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'warm', 'funny', 'delightful', 'Durban', 'even', 'do', 'few', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'are', 'worked', 'story', 'natural', 'way', 'really', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'many', 'fine', 'moments', 'will', 'leave', 'smiling', 'when', 'over.Jonathan', 'Reynolds', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'irracible', 'rich', 'socially', 'prominent', 'tycoon', 'death', 'bed', 'son', 'Jonathan', 'Jr.', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'home', 'Mexico', 'new', 'fiance', 'Gloria', 'Margaret', 'Tallichet', 'see', 'event', 'papers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'meet', 'young', 'Jonathan', 'bride', 'be', 'hideous', 'mother', 'have', 'left', 'hotel', 'go', 'shopping', 'desparate', 'Jonathan', 'talks', 'coat', 'check', 'girl', 'Anne', 'Terry', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'pretending', 'be', 'Gloria', '50.00', 'money', 'train', 'fare', 'back', 'Shelbyville', 'abandoning', 'dreams', 'singing', 'stardom', 'are', 'going', 'nowhere.A', 'teary', 'eyed', 'Anne', 'warm', 'instant', 'connection', 'old', 'man', 'Jonathan', 'who', 'unexpected', 'recovery', 'thanks', 'charm', 'warmth', 'complications', 'Jonathan', 'who', 'catch', 'Anne', 'train', 'station', 'twice', 'order', 'keep', 'charade', 'going', 'interplay', 'two', 'start', 'bickering', 'priceless', 'Even', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'truth', 'along', 'can', 'see', 'right', 'girl', 'son', 'Jonathan', 'Jr.', 'daughter-in-law', 'course', 'Jonathan', 'Jr.', 'still', 'marry', 'real', 'Gloria', 'subplot', 'party', 'will', 'be', 'attended', 'Stokowski', 'Heifetz', 'friends', 'old', 'man', 'Anne', 'may', 'finally', 'get', 'chance', 'be', 'noticed', 'too', 'sweet', 'go', 'returning', 'home', 'Shelbyville', 'prompting', 'wise', 'old', 'Jonathan', 'hatch', 'up', 'little', 'plan', 'own.A', 'night', 'town', 'where', 'delightful', 'Durbin', 'teaches', 'Laughton', 'do', 'Conga', 'swank', 'nightclub', 'particular', 'highlight', 'stellar', 'film', 'Deanna', 'tearful', 'rendition', 'Goin', 'Home', 'also', 'hilarious', 'fight', 'scene', 'Durbin', 'Cummings', 'chasing', 'other', 'place', 'biting', 'pinching', 'will', 'surely', 'leave', 'floor', 'one', 'Durbin', 'best', 'films', 'had', 'flair', 'light', 'comedy', 'warmth', 'sincerity', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'love', 'Durbin', 'enjoy', 'great', 'comedy', 'classy', 'production', 'chance', 'see', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'always', 'forever', 'Last', 'Rose', 'Summer']",It Started With Eve VHS
369670,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6303328199,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","Would anyone not take a bet that a 20-year-old young woman would be mincemeat if she tried to take a film away from the skilled and hammy hands of Charles Laughton, especially when Laughton, to modern eyes, looks suspiciously like he's playing Tim Conway playing one of Conway's old, tottering geezers? It Started With Eve, an attractive romantic comedy, stars Deanna Durbin, Robert Cummings and Charles Laughton. It was a shame Laughton wasn't a few years younger. He and Durbin turn out to be quite a pair, both of them adept at delivering smart lines, doing subtle double-takes or moving from subversive good cheer to tear-jerker moments of sincerity. They dominate the film and they do it as equals. Robert Cummings was a skilled light-weight lead. Here. as in so many of his films, he just doesn't have the leading-man gravitas to appear as anything but an earnest puppy. When he shares a scene with either Laughton or Durbin, he makes a pleasant second banana.It Started With Eve begins with Jonathan Reynolds (Laughton), a rich old tycoon, apparently on his death bed. When his son, Jonathan Junior (Cummings), comes rushing in from a trip to Mexico, old Jonathan asks to meet young Jonathan's new fiance, who has come to New York with him, accompanied by her mother. Young Jonathan tries to contact his fiance, can't reach her, and believing his father is now dying, happens upon Anne Terry (Durbin), a hat-check girl. He rushes Anne to the side of his father and introduces her as his fiance. But the next day his father recovers. Now young Jonathan has his fiance he can't let his father meet, and his father wants to keep seeing Anne, thinking she's the fiance. The movie's an hour-and-a-half of mistaken identity and screw-ball encounters. Love finally wins out, but only after Laughton plays matchmaker and Durbin sings two or three songs. Along the way we have some clever lines (""The trouble with being sick is you have to associate with doctors!""), a good deal of skullduggery as Laughton contrives to smoke the cigars his doctor forbids him, and a fast pace set by director Henry Koster. Laughton, of course, overacts but gets away with it. He also has a comb-up hair style that, if he were a foot shorter, would let him pass for a munchkin. He does a lot of stooped-over shuffling, squinting from under his eye-brows, and little bits of business that we wind up hardly noticing when Durbin is around. She must have been quite a challenge for him. Durbin, at 20, is no longer the child star. She's well-nigh gorgeous, with a figure that could make staring illegal. She is natural and straight-forward, and completely self-assured. She's one of the few actresses who could get away with sniffing mightily or falling down next to a piano and make us smile just at her style. She was, in a word or two, sui generis. And for those who admire subversive scene-stealers, the movie has that master, Walter Catlett, playing Dr. Harvey. Catlett was in hundreds of films, usually playing blowhards or flustered shysters. He's a bit subdued here, but just the sound of his voice is enough to make me smile.The movie is a bit of froth, expertly served. If it's a little dated, well, so am I. It's one of the six Deanna Durbin films on two DVD discs which make up the Deanna Durbin Sweetheart Pack. The picture transfer looks very good.

I can't say it better than that - it's my favourite of all Deanna Durbin movies and is an absolute delight from start to finish.When Cummings thinks his father (Laughton) is dying he needs to bring his fiancee to meet him before it's too late.  Unfortunately, he can't reach her at her hotel and so grabs the first woman he sees (Durbin) and brings her along instead.The father likes her immediately and takes a turn for the better - Cummings is now stuck with a fake fiancee and he can't tell his father in case the shock kills him.  But then there's another twist in the tale when the father overhears them talking and finds out about the ruse but likes her so much that he wants his son to be with her instead of his real fiancee.Durbin is excellent as the poor woman caught in the middle of everything, torn between doing the right thing and carrying on the ruse.  At the same time she comes to care for the old man and falls in love with the son which gives her even more problems to deal with.A great sparkling comedy that still allows Durbin to sing some fabulous songs.

The man is beside himself because he cannot find Gloria, his fianc&eacute;e, who went out shopping with her mother. Instead, he pays a girl (Deanna Durbin) who works at the hotel to pose as his fianc&eacute;e for the night, since his father will never know the difference. She takes the job so that she can go visit her family in Ohio with the money. However, the girl's wholesome looks and vibrant personality charm the old man and he makes a full recovery, leaving the man with an interesting situation.This film is very funny throughout. The charade is the most obviously humorous part, but other minor parts evoke laughter as well. The newspapermen are funny, Laughton's desire for a cigar is funny, and Durbin's tenacity when it comes to music is funny.Durbin is outstanding in this film. She is realistic and mature, making her character quite believable despite the hair-brained situation. It makes it easy to understand why the old man would like her so much. She is sweet and sincere, a ""good girl,"" but by no means an annoying one. She is also playful and likeably heartbreaking at times.Laughton is almost unrecognizable at times in his old man makeup. He plays the amusing sick man to the hilt in a way reminiscent of Lionel Barrymore. He is subtlety cute and funny at the same time, and obviously very sensitive but honest underneath the playful exterior.Cummings has good chemistry with Durbin and is effective in his emotional scenes. However, he takes a backseat to the other stars.The music in Durbin's films is almost as important as the story. She sings three in this film. The first is ""When I Sing"" which sounds startlingly familiar to the ""Once Upon a Dream"" song from Sleeping Beauty. The process of preparing for the song is quite funny. The second song is a jumpy Spanish number. It shows off Durbin's many talents including that of vocal, piano, and energetic presence.

It took 10 movies, all big moneymakers, to work her and her captious fans cautiously up to this little offering; which is considered one of her best.  Cummings brings Deanna to meet his Dad (Charles Laughton) but only as a last minute replacement because his real finacee is unavailable (it is thought that Pop is dying and Bobby will inherit millions of $$). As it turns out old Pop regains his health plus he's taken a real shining to imposter Deanna! Cute and charming with Laughton giving a delightful performance full of feeling, and his timing is impeccable.  Until her marriage on April 18, 1941, Durbin played only demure or saucy little girls who, rarely, in a daring moment, go a chaste little puppy-love peck on the cheek.  But now that she was Ms. Vaughan Paul, wife of a Hollywood producer, she stepped out in IT HAPPENED WITH EVE as a full-grown cinema siren, capable of biting, kissing or slapping her man around.  The only child star who weathered the awkward age (unlike Shirley Temple) without once faltering at the box-office, Durbin enchanted audiences with her pretty face, graceful figure and a voice as radiant as a clear Spring morning.  A big share of this film's merry quality is due to the expert acting of Charles Laughton.  His crusty 75-year-old tycoon, revived miraculously form  a death bed by a pretty face and a shapely leg, is the movies' most engaging character. It gave him a field day for winking and mugging, whispering and roaring, shuffling around in a nightgown, romping over chairs and kicking up his heels in a thumping conga.",4,FUN WITH DEANNA,958608000,"05 18, 2000",2000,1586,"['Deanna', 'Durbin', 'took', '10', 'movies', 'big', 'moneymakers', 'work', 'captious', 'fans', 'cautiously', 'little', 'offering', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'Cummings', 'Deanna', 'meet', 'Dad', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'only', 'last', 'minute', 'replacement', 'real', 'finacee', 'unavailable', 'thought', 'Pop', 'dying', 'Bobby', 'will', 'inherit', 'millions', 'out', 'old', 'Pop', 'health', 'taken', 'real', 'shining', 'imposter', 'Deanna', 'Cute', 'charming', 'Laughton', 'giving', 'delightful', 'performance', 'full', 'feeling', 'timing', 'impeccable', 'marriage', 'April', '18', '1941', 'Durbin', 'played', 'only', 'demure', 'saucy', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'rarely', 'daring', 'moment', 'go', 'chaste', 'little', 'puppy-love', 'peck', 'cheek', 'now', 'was', 'Ms.', 'Vaughan', 'Paul', 'wife', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'stepped', 'out', 'IT', 'HAPPENED', 'WITH', 'EVE', 'full-grown', 'cinema', 'siren', 'capable', 'biting', 'kissing', 'slapping', 'man', 'only', 'child', 'star', 'who', 'weathered', 'awkward', 'age', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'once', 'faltering', 'box-office', 'Durbin', 'enchanted', 'audiences', 'pretty', 'face', 'graceful', 'figure', 'voice', 'as', 'radiant', 'clear', 'Spring', 'morning', 'big', 'share', 'film', 'merry', 'quality', 'due', 'expert', 'acting', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'crusty', '75-year-old', 'tycoon', 'revived', 'miraculously', 'form', 'death', 'bed', 'pretty', 'face', 'shapely', 'leg', 'movies', 'most', 'engaging', 'character', 'gave', 'field', 'day', 'winking', 'mugging', 'whispering', 'roaring', 'shuffling', 'around', 'nightgown', 'romping', 'chairs', 'kicking', 'up', 'heels', 'thumping', 'conga']",It Started With Eve VHS

Durbin, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, has a knack for facetious comic timing as well, the heavy-lidded, seen-it-all variety that Rosalind Russell and Barbara Stanwyck mastered.  Charles Laughton tries a little too hard to be a crinkly, charming old tycoon, but he pulls it off pretty well.  This late screwball comedy features the handsome pratfall Robert Cummings, but the chemistry the movie presumes to show between him and Durbin seems a little superficial if not non-existent (other than the nearly kinky pinching scene, of course).
