853401,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002ZH5PQ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[13, 60]","Thank the Lord above. I felt that was an appropriate comment to make after this film. I would first like to say that this film, while Mormon themed, had a very interesting style of cinematography. Throughout the film, I kept waiting for there to be a hardcore sex scene between a various amounts of combinations and partners. Now, before you scream ""sacrilege"", I want to explain my rationing for this. The way that director Andrew Black chose to position this film was very reminiscent of a soft-core porn film. The dialogue, the story, and even the characters seemed all too ready to rip of their cloths and go at it with everyone they came in contact with ... but sadly, there wasn't anything about sex in this film. There wasn't even a mention of it when all of these girls wanted to marry. It was frightening, it seemed and felt like the concept of sex wasn't even involved in these character's minds. I don't know if this is how the Mormon religion operates, or if Black was just trying to stress a point, but it brought the quality of this film down on the Andy-A-Meter.With the level of quality already at an all-time low, this film moved slowly away from reality and into a world that I could not believe existed. This was one of those films that wanted to be as real as possible with some fancy camera work and bubbly characters, but instead took us farther away from the truth. I have never been to Salt Lake City, but I don't believe that it is as clean as what is shown in this film. I must also say that this is yet another film where college students (poor most of the time) somehow were able to afford some of the most beautiful items and see that money is not an issue. So, it lost respect by depicting a ""perfect"" world and by proving that money is not needed to have beautiful things and to become famous (or to fall in love with ""perfect"" men). Darcy was this wealthy individual because he owned a publishing firm, Bennett was this poor writer that was, at times, fancier than Darcy ... which didn't make any sense to me at all. Where was the sex?Pride and Prejudice is side-titled, as ""A latter-day Comedy"" ... here is my question: how is it a latter-day comedy? All of the characters are LDS, right? Let's review the points:Ok, the little red head (Lydia) never marries and is portrayed as completely happy and successful.Charlie's sister is LDS -- all she cares about is money and she marries a billionaire -- for his money -- not for reasons of the church.Back to Lydia -- I hate to say it (because I hate when people complain about modesty) but what she was wearing to church and portraying as somewhat of a normal thing to do is not what I've seen from any of my Mormon friends.Elizabeth's love fling -- I think it was Jack--He's LDS right? Yet, at the end of the film he is tried for 3 counts of bigamy and he has a major gambling addiction??? I don't get it -- why portray members of the LDS church like that?Now on to Darcy -- ok, he could have cared less about Elizabeth's friends in one scene of the movie, and in the next he is willing to bust away from an LA meeting and go to Vegas to stop one of Elizabeth's friends from marrying -- the way he had been developed throughout the film made that unbelievable to me.Overall, I don't think the movie should be marketed as an LDS or a ""Latter-day Comedy."" This version of Pride and Prejudice was dull, overly cultured, and heavily faith based when the original story was not. I realize that people are allowed creative rights, but when it ends up looking like a soft-core porno film, I think a line has to be drawn. Andrew Black did not do his homework on Mormons or about the faith. There are too many contradictions and plot holes in this film that ultimately make this version the WORST adaptation that I have seen of Austen's work. I do not suggest this film unless you really have two hours to waste and want to head to confession afterwards. In other words, skip this film PLEASE!!!Grade: * out of *****",1,Even the worst people can be nice to their friends.,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,3988,"['Thank', 'Lord', 'felt', 'was', 'appropriate', 'comment', 'make', 'film', 'would', 'first', 'like', 'say', 'film', 'Mormon', 'themed', 'had', 'very', 'interesting', 'style', 'cinematography', 'film', 'kept', 'waiting', 'be', 'hardcore', 'sex', 'scene', 'various', 'amounts', 'combinations', 'partners', 'Now', 'scream', 'sacrilege', 'want', 'explain', 'rationing', 'way', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Black', 'chose', 'position', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'film', 'dialogue', 'story', 'even', 'characters', 'seemed', 'too', 'ready', 'rip', 'cloths', 'go', 'everyone', 'came', 'contact', 'sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'sex', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'when', 'girls', 'wanted', 'marry', 'was', 'frightening', 'seemed', 'felt', 'concept', 'sex', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'involved', 'character', 'minds', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Mormon', 'religion', 'Black', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'stress', 'point', 'brought', 'quality', 'film', 'down', 'Andy-A-Meter.With', 'level', 'quality', 'already', 'all-time', 'low', 'film', 'moved', 'slowly', 'away', 'reality', 'world', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'existed', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'wanted', 'be', 'as', 'real', 'possible', 'fancy', 'camera', 'work', 'bubbly', 'characters', 'instead', 'took', 'farther', 'away', 'truth', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'as', 'clean', 'what', 'shown', 'film', 'must', 'also', 'say', 'yet', 'film', 'where', 'college', 'students', 'poor', 'most', 'time', 'somehow', 'were', 'able', 'afford', 'most', 'beautiful', 'items', 'see', 'money', 'not', 'issue', 'So', 'lost', 'respect', 'depicting', 'perfect', 'world', 'proving', 'money', 'not', 'needed', 'have', 'beautiful', 'things', 'become', 'famous', 'fall', 'love', 'perfect', 'men', 'Darcy', 'was', 'wealthy', 'individual', 'owned', 'publishing', 'firm', 'Bennett', 'was', 'poor', 'writer', 'was', 'times', 'fancier', 'Darcy', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Where', 'was', 'sex', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'side-titled', 'A', 'latter-day', 'Comedy', 'here', 'question', 'how', 'latter-day', 'comedy', 'characters', 'are', 'LDS', 'right', 'Let', 'review', 'points', 'Ok', 'little', 'red', 'head', 'Lydia', 'never', 'marries', 'portrayed', 'completely', 'happy', 'successful.Charlie', 'sister', 'LDS', 'about', 'money', 'billionaire', 'money', 'not', 'reasons', 'church.Back', 'Lydia', 'hate', 'say', 'hate', 'when', 'people', 'complain', 'modesty', 'what', 'was', 'wearing', 'church', 'portraying', 'somewhat', 'normal', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mormon', 'friends.Elizabeth', 'love', 'fling', 'think', 'was', 'Jack', 'LDS', 'right', 'Yet', 'end', 'film', 'tried', '3', 'counts', 'bigamy', 'major', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'portray', 'members', 'LDS', 'church', 'Now', 'Darcy', 'ok', 'could', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'Elizabeth', 'friends', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'next', 'willing', 'bust', 'away', 'LA', 'meeting', 'go', 'Vegas', 'stop', 'one', 'Elizabeth', 'friends', 'marrying', 'way', 'had', 'been', 'developed', 'film', 'made', 'unbelievable', 'me.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'marketed', 'LDS', 'Latter-day', 'Comedy', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'was', 'dull', 'overly', 'cultured', 'heavily', 'faith', 'based', 'when', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'realize', 'people', 'are', 'allowed', 'creative', 'rights', 'when', 'up', 'looking', 'soft-core', 'porno', 'film', 'think', 'line', 'be', 'drawn', 'Andrew', 'Black', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'homework', 'Mormons', 'faith', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'contradictions', 'plot', 'holes', 'film', 'ultimately', 'make', 'version', 'WORST', 'adaptation', 'have', 'seen', 'Austen', 'work', 'do', 'not', 'suggest', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'two', 'hours', 'waste', 'want', 'head', 'confession', 'afterwards', 'other', 'words', 'skip', 'film', 'PLEASE', 'Grade', '*', '*****']",N/A
853402,APKPDDUZG8MQH,B0002ZH5PQ,Anita,"[20, 21]","This version of Pride & Prejudice is a beautiful & delightful modern twist on a Jane Austine classic.  This relatively unknown gem was the brainchild of director Andrew Black and cinematographer Travis Cline.  Filmed mostly in Provo Utah this film proves that beauty and quality can be created on a shoe string, many of the locations and the use of the vehicles seen in the film were donated.  And many of the extras donated their time also.  This being said there is no scrimping on style and charm and talent in this film. The main characters were played by Kam Heskin, British actor Orlando Seale, Argentinean actress Lucila Sola & a local young man Ben Gourley.  I guarantee we haven't seen the last of these young actors. Kam Heskin & Orlando Seale already have other film credits under their belt.  This is a light comedy distributed by Excel Entertainment Group. To get an idea of the look of this film they have a colorful website that can be found on the world web dot prideprejudice dot com  This film is good clean fun perfect for a 13 to 16  year old female, although I must admit that I a 49 year old female have been mezmerized by it's charm through 4 viewings, and I can't count the times my 12 year old has seen it.

There are liberties taken but in general these are benign -- Elizabeth has roommates instead of sisters, Collins does not marry Charlotte, etc.; however, some decisions are more successful than others (IMHO, it would have been preferable to include Elizabeth's parents rather than indulging in several of Elizabeth's fantasy sequences, for instance).  But mostly this is a fun adaptation with a talented cast, led by proud Orlando Seale and prejudiced Kam Heskin.Chapters are frequently begun with quotes from the novel, there are lots of insider references to the original (such as a dog named Austen, a restaurant named Rosings and a bowling league named Netherfield), and an optional extra allows you to see pop-up facts about the novel as the film plays.DVD extras include a commentary track with the producer and director, 5 minutes of outtakes, 24 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage, the full infomercial from the film, and a Macintosh or Windows version of ""The Pink Bible"", a book that figures largely in the film.",4,benign update of Austen's masterwork,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,1205,"['are', 'not', 'Austen', 'purist', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'modern', 'update', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'now', 'set', 'Utah', 'Canadian', 'producer', 'Scottish', 'director', 'are', 'liberties', 'taken', 'general', 'are', 'benign', 'Elizabeth', 'roommates', 'instead', 'sisters', 'Collins', 'not', 'marry', 'Charlotte', 'etc', 'however', 'decisions', 'are', 'more', 'successful', 'others', 'IMHO', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'preferable', 'include', 'Elizabeth', 'parents', 'rather', 'indulging', 'several', 'Elizabeth', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'instance', 'mostly', 'fun', 'adaptation', 'talented', 'cast', 'led', 'proud', 'Orlando', 'Seale', 'prejudiced', 'Kam', 'Heskin.Chapters', 'are', 'frequently', 'begun', 'quotes', 'novel', 'are', 'lots', 'insider', 'references', 'original', 'such', 'dog', 'named', 'Austen', 'restaurant', 'named', 'Rosings', 'bowling', 'league', 'named', 'Netherfield', 'optional', 'extra', 'allows', 'see', 'pop-up', 'facts', 'novel', 'film', 'plays.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'producer', 'director', '5', 'minutes', 'outtakes', '24', 'minutes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'full', 'infomercial', 'film', 'Macintosh', 'Windows', 'version', 'Pink', 'Bible', 'book', 'largely', 'film']",N/A

853410,A1NOUWW8UTENGP,B0002ZH5PQ,"Eric C. Erickson ""AxelDC""","[9, 21]","As a BYU alum, I was surprised to stumble across this film on cable.  The Provo background was amusing to see, since I haven't been there for many years.  I'm still scratching my head as to why the director thought Jane Austen belonged there, except that he was Mormon himself.The characters in this film are more Mormon stereotypes than Jane Austen creations.  The creepy marriage-hungry man using religion to conive poor women into marriage.  The late 20s woman who stresses because she hasn't wed (the average marriage age in DC is 30, and 22 in Utah).  The silly girls who see church as a social outlet and not a place of devotion.  The ordinary guy who is seen as a cad for failing to live up to Mormonism's expecatations.  The rich bishop's kid and his kooky money making scheme.The only character that was completely out of place was that of Mr. Darcy.  If Jane Austen hadn't written him in, he would have never been in this Mollywood film.  First of all, there are precious few Brits in Utah.  Second, he has little reason to be living in Provo since he is not a BYU student and doesn't work for Novell.  Finally, he is obviously miserable there and probably not LDS based on his reaction to the people around him.  He truly is a fish out of water in this tale.This seems to be the heart of the problem: the Jane Austen aspects of the film clash with the LDS setting.

853411,A3LH77PBDFEO3F,B0002ZH5PQ,"G. E. Williams ""Nunah""","[6, 10]","First of all, let me confess.I bought Pride and Prejudice, because it was heavily promoted at an LDS video site.I watched it the first time with my wife, who mostly enjoyed it, but was not thrilled .I watched the extra features and was fascinated with the process of making a movie on a tiny budget.A few weeks ago, I was channel surfing, and it was on ENCORE, and I watched it again, this time I was more impressed both with the comedy, and the adaptation of Austen's book.As to ""the other issue"" of this being a ""Mormon"" movie let me digress for a moment.First of all, there is a very small attempt in the media to bring part of the LDS experience to mainstream Literature, Music and Movies. Very, very small. Best selling Author Orson Scott Card, has had a few Story lines, in a few of his books that are outright LDS, but mostly, you have to know what you are looking for.There have been a few theatrical releases about the Mission experience. Which were immediately followed up by pornographic movies about missionaries, being misguided boys who are gay, but they don't know it having been raised in a repressive environment.So, back to the issue at hand, what part of the LDS experience is comical to look at without being degrading to beliefs of members? The perfect match is the BYU dating experience of twenty years ago. In the 1979 opening devotional, I seem to recall there being a statement about 30% of the student body being Freshman girls, BYU was affectionately known by former missionaries as the happy hunting ground because of the heavily skewed female to male ratio of the student body. The current necessity of two income families notwithstanding, in LDS culture, Mother, and by default Wife, is the most sacred and important job anyone can aspire to. So... where else would you put a modern setting of young women insanely searching for husbands? Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" fits in perfectly with the old fashioned way of thinking one might attribute to Mormon culture. Now, that being said, this film appropriately carves up all the inappropriate notions attached to that thinking. Which is what makes it a good movie for Mormons, because it challenges what is not appropriate, without attacking core beliefs.So... Is this a worthwhile film? I think it is.Is this a Mormon film? Sort of but not really, It has LDS Characters, it takes place in a predominately LDS city and school. Otherwise, it is a romantic comedy.Is it cheesy? Well, yes, but in a good way.",5,Where else could you set a modern Pride and Prejudice?,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,2486,"['First', 'let', 'confess.I', 'bought', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'was', 'heavily', 'promoted', 'LDS', 'video', 'site.I', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'wife', 'who', 'mostly', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'not', 'thrilled', '.I', 'watched', 'extra', 'features', 'was', 'fascinated', 'process', 'making', 'movie', 'tiny', 'budget.A', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'was', 'channel', 'surfing', 'was', 'ENCORE', 'watched', 'again', 'time', 'was', 'more', 'impressed', 'comedy', 'adaptation', 'Austen', 'book.As', 'other', 'issue', 'being', 'Mormon', 'movie', 'let', 'digress', 'moment.First', 'very', 'small', 'attempt', 'media', 'bring', 'part', 'LDS', 'experience', 'mainstream', 'Literature', 'Music', 'Movies', 'Very', 'very', 'small', 'Best', 'selling', 'Author', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'had', 'few', 'Story', 'lines', 'few', 'books', 'are', 'outright', 'LDS', 'mostly', 'have', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'for.There', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'Mission', 'experience', 'were', 'immediately', 'followed', 'up', 'pornographic', 'movies', 'missionaries', 'being', 'misguided', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'gay', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'having', 'been', 'raised', 'repressive', 'environment.So', 'back', 'issue', 'hand', 'what', 'part', 'LDS', 'experience', 'comical', 'look', 'being', 'degrading', 'beliefs', 'members', 'perfect', 'match', 'BYU', 'dating', 'experience', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', '1979', 'opening', 'devotional', 'seem', 'recall', 'there', 'being', 'statement', '30', '%', 'student', 'body', 'being', 'Freshman', 'girls', 'BYU', 'was', 'affectionately', 'known', 'former', 'missionaries', 'happy', 'hunting', 'ground', 'heavily', 'skewed', 'female', 'male', 'ratio', 'student', 'body', 'current', 'necessity', 'two', 'income', 'families', 'notwithstanding', 'LDS', 'culture', 'Mother', 'default', 'Wife', 'most', 'sacred', 'important', 'job', 'anyone', 'can', 'aspire', 'So', 'where', 'else', 'would', 'put', 'modern', 'setting', 'young', 'women', 'insanely', 'searching', 'husbands', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'perfectly', 'old', 'fashioned', 'way', 'thinking', 'one', 'might', 'attribute', 'Mormon', 'culture', 'Now', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'appropriately', 'up', 'inappropriate', 'notions', 'attached', 'thinking', 'Which', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'Mormons', 'what', 'not', 'appropriate', 'attacking', 'core', 'beliefs.So', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'think', 'Mormon', 'film', 'Sort', 'not', 'really', 'LDS', 'Characters', 'place', 'predominately', 'LDS', 'city', 'school', 'Otherwise', 'romantic', 'comedy.Is', 'Well', 'yes', 'good', 'way']",N/A

853416,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002ZH5PQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[118, 124]","If Hollywood can turn Jane Austen's ""Emma"" into ""Clueless,"" then it is not surprising that they would made ""Pride & Prejudice"" into ""A Latter-Day Comedy,"" as happens in this 2003 film from director Andrew Black.  Once Leonard Bernstein turned ""Romeo & Juliet"" into ""West Side Story"" pretty much all things became possible in this regard.  But given that Austen's heroine Elizabeth Bennett had to contend with the strictures of social class and the demands of family fidelity, there are some inherent problems in such an effort.  The screenplay by Anne K. Black, Jason Faller and Katherine Swigert does this by jettisoning the parents and other adults and deciding to tell the story in Salt Lake City: Suddenly light bulbs come on and the fact this is a ""Latter-Day"" comedy because the characters are primarily Mormons and Elizabeth Bennett is a student at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.Surprisingly, despite the success of the sterling BBC/A&E; production where Collin Firth was the first Darcy I ever saw that made the role work, there has not been a theatrical version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" since 1940, let alone in a modern setting.  So we have the new and improved Elizabeth Bennett (Kam Heskin) who is now both a student and an aspiring novelist.  Instead of being saddled with four sisters she now has four housemates, Jane (Lucila Sol&aacute;) from Argentina, Mary (Rainy Kerwin), Lydia (Kelly Stables), and Kitty (Nicole Hamilton).  Elizabeth is snubbed by Fitzwilliam Darcy (Orlando Seale) while Jane is smitten by Charles Bingley (Ben Gourley), whose sister Caroline (Kara Holden) has her eyes set on Darcy.  Then there are the new versions of Jack Wickham (Henry Maguire), Charlotte (Carmen Rasmusen), and Collins (Hubbel Palmer).I was wondering if you could enjoy this version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" without being familiar with Austen's novel and quickly realized this was a moot point because choice quotations from Austen's work are provide (with cites no less).  This film does not want you to forget they are updating Jane Austen and in fact that ends up being necessary for smoothing over the problematic part of the story, which is when Darcy, who is still English, expresses his interesting in dating Elizabeth in a manner and with words so condescending that she cuts him off at the knees and looks like she would want to continue working her way up his body with her sharp instrument of choice.  In the English society of Austen's time when arranged marriages were much more the norm, Darcy's approach was at least understandable (and part of the charm of the novel is that the heroine's future mate digs himself one of the biggest holes in Western literature from which to continue wooing a woman).  But being English does not seem to allow this Darcy the same liberty to be so insensitive and the problem is that Seale has to reconcile the prejudicial jerk of the first act with the nice guy who emerges by act three (Seale is not alone in facing this problem as Darcy; as I indicated above, only Firth has carried it off as far as I am concerned).Fortunately Heskin is winsome in the role of Elizabeth and they come up with some cute ways of updating some of the twists and turns in Austen's novel.  Therefore it is not surprising that some of the more memorable scenes in the film are those that never appeared in the novel (the aftermath of Elizabeth's refusal of her first offer of marriage is probably my favorite).  As for the fact this is a ""Mormon"" movie, I suppose members of the Church of Latter-Day Saints will be able to point to lots of things that make it such, but I never really noticed anything so I cannot imagine many people are going to be able to find fault with the film on that score.  The result is an enjoyable enough family film and there is something to be said for having a ""clean"" romantic comedy that never tries to sanitize the story or get as zany as what happened with ""Clueless.""  Austen purists will no doubt be offended, but that judgment will be made before the opening credits are done and they still have the BBC/A&E; version to watch for the umpteenth time.",4,Another attempt to modernize a Jane Austen novel,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,4131,"['Hollywood', 'can', 'turn', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Emma', 'Clueless', 'then', 'not', 'surprising', 'would', 'made', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Latter-Day', 'Comedy', 'happens', '2003', 'film', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Black', 'Once', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'turned', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'pretty', 'much', 'things', 'became', 'possible', 'regard', 'given', 'Austen', 'heroine', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'had', 'contend', 'strictures', 'social', 'class', 'demands', 'family', 'fidelity', 'are', 'inherent', 'problems', 'such', 'effort', 'screenplay', 'Anne', 'K.', 'Black', 'Jason', 'Faller', 'Katherine', 'Swigert', 'jettisoning', 'parents', 'other', 'adults', 'deciding', 'tell', 'story', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'Suddenly', 'light', 'bulbs', 'come', 'fact', 'Latter-Day', 'comedy', 'characters', 'are', 'primarily', 'Mormons', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'student', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'University', 'Provo', 'Utah.Surprisingly', 'success', 'sterling', 'BBC/A', 'E', 'production', 'where', 'Collin', 'Firth', 'was', 'first', 'Darcy', 'ever', 'saw', 'made', 'role', 'work', 'not', 'been', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '1940', 'let', 'alone', 'modern', 'setting', 'have', 'new', 'improved', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'Kam', 'Heskin', 'who', 'now', 'student', 'aspiring', 'novelist', 'Instead', 'being', 'saddled', 'four', 'sisters', 'now', 'four', 'housemates', 'Jane', 'Lucila', 'Sol', 'aacute', 'Argentina', 'Mary', 'Rainy', 'Kerwin', 'Lydia', 'Kelly', 'Stables', 'Kitty', 'Nicole', 'Hamilton', 'Elizabeth', 'snubbed', 'Fitzwilliam', 'Darcy', 'Orlando', 'Seale', 'Jane', 'smitten', 'Charles', 'Bingley', 'Ben', 'Gourley', 'sister', 'Caroline', 'Kara', 'Holden', 'eyes', 'set', 'Darcy', 'Then', 'are', 'new', 'versions', 'Jack', 'Wickham', 'Henry', 'Maguire', 'Charlotte', 'Carmen', 'Rasmusen', 'Collins', 'Hubbel', 'Palmer', '.I', 'was', 'wondering', 'could', 'enjoy', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'being', 'familiar', 'Austen', 'novel', 'quickly', 'realized', 'was', 'moot', 'point', 'choice', 'quotations', 'Austen', 'work', 'are', 'provide', 'less', 'film', 'not', 'want', 'forget', 'are', 'updating', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fact', 'up', 'being', 'necessary', 'smoothing', 'problematic', 'part', 'story', 'when', 'Darcy', 'who', 'still', 'English', 'interesting', 'dating', 'Elizabeth', 'manner', 'words', 'so', 'condescending', 'off', 'knees', 'would', 'want', 'continue', 'working', 'way', 'body', 'sharp', 'instrument', 'choice', 'English', 'society', 'Austen', 'time', 'when', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'norm', 'Darcy', 'approach', 'was', 'least', 'understandable', 'part', 'charm', 'novel', 'heroine', 'future', 'mate', 'digs', 'one', 'biggest', 'holes', 'Western', 'literature', 'continue', 'wooing', 'woman', 'being', 'English', 'not', 'seem', 'allow', 'Darcy', 'same', 'liberty', 'be', 'so', 'insensitive', 'problem', 'Seale', 'reconcile', 'prejudicial', 'jerk', 'first', 'act', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'act', 'three', 'Seale', 'not', 'alone', 'facing', 'problem', 'Darcy', 'indicated', 'above', 'only', 'Firth', 'carried', 'off', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', '.Fortunately', 'Heskin', 'winsome', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'come', 'up', 'cute', 'ways', 'updating', 'twists', 'turns', 'Austen', 'novel', 'not', 'surprising', 'more', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'never', 'appeared', 'novel', 'aftermath', 'Elizabeth', 'refusal', 'first', 'offer', 'marriage', 'probably', 'favorite', 'fact', 'Mormon', 'movie', 'suppose', 'members', 'Church', 'Latter-Day', 'Saints', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'point', 'lots', 'things', 'make', 'such', 'never', 'really', 'noticed', 'anything', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'fault', 'film', 'score', 'result', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'family', 'film', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'having', 'clean', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'never', 'sanitize', 'story', 'get', 'as', 'zany', 'what', 'happened', 'Clueless', 'Austen', 'purists', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'offended', 'judgment', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'done', 'still', 'have', 'BBC/A', 'E', 'version', 'watch', 'umpteenth', 'time']",N/A

It doesn't say anything about being set in modern times - but it most definitely is. Not only that, but it's set in Salt Lake City, Utah. It's a very funny movie, but it's not an actual adaptation of the book :)In this version, Elizabeth Bennett is a blonde writer going to school at BYU. Jane is her Argentinian roommate. Lydia, Kitty and Mary are all in the story too, retaining their general characteristics. The Bingleys are a rich pair who breeze into town, along of course with Darcy, who owns a publishing firm.There are parts of the movie that I love - and others that really bug me a lot. For example, Lydia and Kitty maliciously do various things to try to muscle in on Jane and Elizabeth's beaus. That's completely against the ""regular"" storyline, where the family was generally supportive and helpful. That's what made some of the scenes so poignant, that Lizzie loved her family dearly even as they embarassed her.On the other hand, though, when Mary is making a fool of herself musically, it's Lizzie who gets up on stage and rescues her, not the father. So they make an effort to show more of Lizzie's tender side. They also introduce Wickham right at the beginning, as a long term friend of Lizzie's. That strikes me better than having Lizzie start getting friendly with a guy her sisters are already interested in.There are no parents at all in this story - the kids are all on their own completely. Parents are, if anything, a nebulous ""expectation generator"" somewhere offstage. I really felt sad at that too, because the father and mother are such meaningful characters in the story. It's as if they made this story for teens who didn't want to deal with parents any more. In the original story, the parents, aunts and uncles all played important roles. In this one, not even Collins is related any more.Other changes were made that I didn't agree with. Collins publicly humiliates Elizabeth, which is *extremely* ungentlemanly and quite against his character. Darcy had nothing to do really with dragging Bingley away from Jane! Caroline explicitly lied to Elizabeth about being engaged to Darcy? They were changes that weren't necessary, and that turned characters into ""black"" or ""white"" - it lost a great deal of the gorgeous character depth in the story.On the other hand, there were several scenes where I laughed out loud. The little scene-titles that introduce sections of the story are often hilarious. There are a ton of subtle references to the original story. This can be a downfall, though. People who know the story well laugh right away at certain circumstances, understanding the meaning.

I think they just named it P&P; to attract the legions of P&P; lovers out there.  It sells itself as a modern retelling, but everything about the movie is really poorly executed.  The storyline in the movie is weak, the characters and the actors who play them are weak, and the production quality is really poor.  After watching it, I felt like I was duped.  Seriously.  I even had to watch the BBC/A&E; version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle just to get the image of this imposter out of my mind.For those P&P; fans out there in need of a fix - either rent the Colin Firth version or wait for the Keira Knightley-Matthew MacFadyen version coming out next year.

The Mormon film industry didn't exist when I attended school there (1997-1999) and I've been waiting to see a film set on the campus I remember so well with mixed emotions. Unfortunately, we only get a split second glimpse at high speed. But that's not what this film is about.The bright, candy-colored clothes, walls, and other images make this film reminiscent of ""Down With Love"" and ""Clueless""; and this film makes no apologies for being a chick flick. It's probably the most chick flick film I've ever seen so far. Although the movie is about Mormons and set in Provo, Utah, it's actually filmed with a broader audience in mind. We don't get the in your face Mormon doctrine like so many other Mormon movies. This one is meant to appeal to anyone, Jane Austen fan or not.What surprised me most was that I didn't expect the film to be so funny. With enough quirky characters and the agendas they pursue, the set up is guaranteed for laughs aplenty. Mormon audiences, obviously, will enjoy some of the more inside jokes, but anyone who's seen ""Down With Love"" will appreciate the sensibility and humor of this film. I've never read Jane Austen's famous novel, but after seeing this (and ""Bride and Prejudice""), I may just pick it up. I'm not sure how loyal this film is to the novel, but purist who are horrified by the modern retelling should relax. They still have their high quality BBC production starring Colin Firth. This one is meant for those who are hesitant to read Jane Austen, like me, who may actually get curious and start reading.The performances by all the actors are well done, and for a low budget film, I'm impressed.

853430,AIYF0LFBRKFS3,B0002ZH5PQ,T. Florio,"[4, 5]","I picked this movie up used at a Blockbuster store for $1 and reluctantly sat down to watch it last night.  I was first surprised by the quality of the cinematophraphy and sound (I thought this was going to be a cheaply produced movie, given the first time I was aware of the movie was at the $1 discount bin).  The second thing that hit me was the actors.  Jane looked like a brunette Daryl Hannah (who sounded a little like Tommy Wiseau), Collins looked like a tall Pete Dinklage, and Lydia reminded me of a young post-rhinoplastied Lorainne Newman.  The acting is a mix of adequate to excellent.  I think they did fantastic with their choice of actor for Darcy and the actress who played Elizabeth was personable enough to carry the entire movie.  The only performance that seemed a bit much was the actress who played Lydia -- her performance was broader than the others and would have worked best on the stage, although she does dial it down a bit towards the end of the movie.  As for the movie itself, it is not a perfect movie and Austen fans may be miffed at the changes it makes to the original, even if it is a contemporary retelling of the novel.  There are no Mr. & Ms. Bennets, Jane is not Elizabeth's sister, Kitty is younger than Lydia, Charlette is basically a walk on, Charles Bigley is more buffoonish and Collins' storyline veers onto other grounds.  The movie Bride and Prejudice sticks closer to the original but I also enjoyed how Pride & Prejudice goes off in its own.There are plusses I enjoyed (Charles' dog music commercial for one) and minuses (I thought Mary's song misfired) I didn't but in the end, I'm glad I watched this movie and will definitely watch it again.  I may have only payed $1 for my DVD but for those looking for a different take on the novel, this is definitely recommended.Two quick post scripts, however.  While the movie played without a hitch on my DVD player, it gave me problems getting to the menu screen.  This could just be my DVD player however.  Second is, my favorite adaptation is still by far the 1995 version.  This reviewed DVD should in no way be compared with that version.

I do think a Mormon cultural setting is actually an excellent way to spring P&P into a modern context, because really, Mormon young adults tend to think about marrying  alot earlier than most other folks for moral and religious reasons.  The main problem I had with the movie was that it had a tendency to swipe some key scenes from other Jane Austen flicks-ie, P&Pw/Colin Firth, Mansfield Park, Bridget Jones Diary. Other than that, it's a nice, clean cut movie that your kids can watch with you without having to tell them to turn around or cover their ears every moment like most other romantic comedies. My boys actually really liked this when they watched it.",4,Cute movie...,1095465600,"09 18, 2004",2004,744,"['liked', 'movie', 'much-it', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'take', 'actual', 'novel', 'do', 'think', 'Mormon', 'cultural', 'setting', 'actually', 'excellent', 'way', 'spring', 'P', 'P', 'modern', 'context', 'really', 'Mormon', 'young', 'adults', 'tend', 'think', 'marrying', 'alot', 'earlier', 'most', 'other', 'folks', 'moral', 'religious', 'reasons', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'had', 'tendency', 'swipe', 'key', 'scenes', 'other', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'flicks-ie', 'P', 'Pw/Colin', 'Firth', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'Other', 'nice', 'clean', 'cut', 'movie', 'kids', 'can', 'watch', 'having', 'tell', 'turn', 'around', 'cover', 'ears', 'moment', 'most', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'boys', 'actually', 'really', 'liked', 'when', 'watched']",N/A
853432,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,B0002ZH5PQ,Wendy C. Rigney,"[10, 23]","Yes, the title is ""Pride and Prejudice"" and some of the characters share the same name as those in Jane Austen's classic novel. However, that is where the similarities to this movie and the novel part.The fact that the parents and Darcy's aunt are deemed superfluous and are written out - considering it is they whom are sort of the frame work that Darcy and Elizabeth rebel against, so as not to be as unhappy themselves - tells me right there that this movie loses its core. Sure, the society rules and such are likely now needless in a modern adaption, but hey, if you are going to rip off a classic novel down to the names of the characters, you'd think a bit of the tone could be retained.I do like that Jane, Elizabeth's roommate, was Argentinian or whatever, and the film tried to be a bit diverse. But that is not much to offer as praise.I remember the female lead, Kam Heskin, from the soap opera, ""Sunset Beach"". Since the soap was supposed to be campy fun, I guess it worked for her there. But as Elizabeth, I was unimpressed. And I found the rest of the cast equally forgettable.Do you want a modern-day version of ""Pride and Prejudice""? Then watch the first ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", complete with silly mother, a ""rude"" Mr. Darcy (Mark Darcy, that is!) portrayed by the once-again fabulous Colin Firth, and the woman who first takes offense at the rude man due to his behavior towards her, then falls for said man (Bridget Jones, of course, played by Ren&eacute;e Zellweger). *That* was how to tell a modern adaption of P&P.;Not this.",1,Modern-day Pride and Prejudice?

I wish I had done the same thing.  This movie was SO LAME!!!  There was no character development, the couples ended up together just because the story put them together, no because of any attraction or chemistry.  Elizabeth comes off as an arrogant, shallow, feminist and her ""sisters"", or roomates in this version, are poorly sketched mockeries of the originals in the novel.  Not one of the men was remotely attractive, exception being Mr. Darcy, and it's a huge point that the girls go to church but no one else in their group does.  I laughed one time in the entire movie, and spent the rest of the time waiting for it to get better.  The overall effect is so bland and goodhearted, you wonder why any of the couples end up together other than the need to go forth and procreate.
