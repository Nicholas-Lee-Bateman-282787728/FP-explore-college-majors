A woman meets a man while vacationing with her parents. They get married and three years later she finds out he used to be an assassin. Reviewed horribly by critics, I decided to give it a chance anyway. I sometimes like movies and tv shows others don't. In this case, it's really not as terrible as some make it seem. It wasn't great either. I wouldn't recommend spending full list price for it, (I got mine during Black Friday week for $5.99) but it may be worth checking out on sale or if you could purchase it used. Basically to me it seems like a good idea gone a little askew. There were some things in the plot like SPOILER: Jen's pregnancy that weren't really necessary to the movie. Also if Spencer went through rigorous training like he stated, how come he didn't know who the people were who were trying to kill him? Wouldn't he suspect them?

1306066,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B002ZG984Q,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[1, 2]","Robert Luketic's spy comedy, ""Killers"", was pretty effectively vilified by critics when released, and quickly forgotten when Tom Cruise's similarly-themed, better-receivedKnight and Daywas released, three weeks later, but despite it's flaws, there are redeeming features to the film...First and foremost, is the cast. Katherine Heigl is one of the screen's great treasures, a beautiful, genuinely funny actress who can make you laugh and still care about her characters. As a recently jilted, slightly geeky young woman on vacation in Nice, with her overly-protective, mismatched parents (straight-arrow Tom Selleck and tipsy Catherine O'Hara, both terrific), she combines jaded self-depreciation with an almost desperate hope for a 'Prince Charming' to appear. Enter hunky (if miscast) Ashton Kutcher, who is introduced at the start of the film as a successful agent/assassin. He is the best, but increasingly disenchanted with his line of work, dreaming of a 'normal life'...so, naturally, when he and Heigl meet, in a hotel elevator, sparks fly. Their courtship in the south of France (still as magically beautiful a place as in the days of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly), interspersed with his last assignment, is quite effective, with terrific, slyly funny dialogue. Without revealing his past, Kutcher and Heigl marry...Jump ahead three years, and the couple are living an idyllic, 'Ozzie and Harriet'-style existence in a Southern suburb, with good jobs, and a large circle of friends. Then Kutcher's ex-boss (legendary comic actor Martin Mull) calls with an assignment...and suddenly, nearly everybody is trying to kill Kutcher, as he has a multi-million dollar bounty on his head...and Heigl, at last, learns his dark secret (and reveals a not-so-dark one of her own)...with the film sliding into a frenetic, frequently illogical slapstick comedy/chase adventure.While the silly, yet occasionally brutal fights throws the film's initial charm off-kilter, Heigl still manages to keep the story watchable, and the climactic revelations, while not terribly surprising, are played with humor and panache by the four leads.The special features are also entertaining, especially the 'Making Of' featurette (Heigl is as funny off-camera, as on), and the gag reel (offering more laughs than the film!)Ignore the critics...""Killers"" won't win awards, but will bring some smiles!",4,"Thin Plot, but Often Funny, with Great Cast!",1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,2375,"['Robert', 'Luketic', 'spy', 'comedy', 'Killers', 'was', 'pretty', 'effectively', 'vilified', 'critics', 'when', 'released', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'when', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'similarly-themed', 'better-receivedKnight', 'Daywas', 'released', 'three', 'weeks', 'later', 'flaws', 'are', 'redeeming', 'features', 'film', 'First', 'foremost', 'cast', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'one', 'screen', 'great', 'treasures', 'beautiful', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'laugh', 'still', 'care', 'characters', 'recently', 'jilted', 'slightly', 'geeky', 'young', 'woman', 'vacation', 'Nice', 'overly-protective', 'mismatched', 'parents', 'straight-arrow', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'tipsy', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'terrific', 'jaded', 'self-depreciation', 'almost', 'desperate', 'hope', ""'Prince"", 'Charming', 'appear', 'Enter', 'hunky', 'miscast', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'introduced', 'start', 'film', 'successful', 'agent/assassin', 'best', 'increasingly', 'disenchanted', 'line', 'work', 'dreaming', ""'normal"", 'life', 'so', 'naturally', 'when', 'Heigl', 'meet', 'hotel', 'elevator', 'fly', 'courtship', 'south', 'France', 'still', 'magically', 'place', 'days', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'interspersed', 'last', 'assignment', 'quite', 'effective', 'terrific', 'slyly', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'revealing', 'past', 'Kutcher', 'Heigl', 'marry', 'Jump', 'ahead', 'three', 'years', 'couple', 'are', 'living', 'idyllic', ""'Ozzie"", ""Harriet'-style"", 'existence', 'Southern', 'suburb', 'good', 'jobs', 'large', 'circle', 'friends', 'Then', 'Kutcher', 'ex-boss', 'legendary', 'comic', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Mull', 'assignment', 'suddenly', 'nearly', 'everybody', 'trying', 'kill', 'Kutcher', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'bounty', 'head', 'Heigl', 'last', 'dark', 'secret', 'not-so-dark', 'one', 'own', 'film', 'sliding', 'frenetic', 'frequently', 'illogical', 'slapstick', 'comedy/chase', 'silly', 'yet', 'occasionally', 'brutal', 'fights', 'film', 'initial', 'charm', 'off-kilter', 'Heigl', 'still', 'keep', 'story', 'watchable', 'climactic', 'revelations', 'not', 'terribly', 'surprising', 'are', 'played', 'humor', 'panache', 'four', 'leads.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'entertaining', 'especially', ""'Making"", 'featurette', 'Heigl', 'funny', 'off-camera', 'gag', 'reel', 'offering', 'more', 'laughs', 'film', 'critics', 'Killers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'will', 'bring', 'smiles']",N/A

I'm really glad I did cuz it was a pretty good movie.In case you hadn't read any other reviews, here's what the movie entails...Jen, having recently been dumped by her boyfriend, goes on vacation with her parents to Nice, France.

1306075,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG984Q,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 7]","""Killers"" is a movie that exists in a parallel universe. It's profoundly unfunny, and yet the filmmakers seem to labor over its sense of humor, which suggests a belief that someone somewhere would actually be laughing at it. This is not merely misguided; it's otherworldly, as if the writer, director, and producers have been channeling a plane of existence where audiences don't require genuinely funny material to be entertained. It doesn't have much to do with its plot or its action, which are boring and derivative but at least understandably so. No, it has to do with the characters and the dialogue, both so unbelievably strange that it's difficult to imagine who they were supposed to appeal to. Listening to these people talk is like overhearing a conversation from an altogether different movie. I swear, it's as if they're talking in code.It started with Katherine Heigl, whose character, Jennifer, is neurotic, cautious, easily exasperated, and unendurably chatty. I disliked her as early as her first scene, and that's bad because there's nothing inherently unlikeable about her. I had hope that it would end with Jennifer, but alas, it was only the beginning; as the film progressed, I found myself disliking all the people around her, mostly neighbors who have little else to do than be annoying suburban stereotypes. And then there are her parents, given little screen time and developed solely on their quirks. Her father (Tom Selleck) does everything he can to make those around him uncomfortable, as if, in order to be in his presence, one must provide an adequate explanation for why they were born. Her mother (Catherine O'Hara), giddy and overbearing, would benefit from an extended stay at the Betty Ford Clinic.The plot: While vacationing in Nice with her parents, the recently single Jennifer meets Spencer Aimes (Ashton Kutcher), who's handsome, charming, and romantic. He also happens to be a CIA agent, which means he's obligated to drive excessively fast in sleek sports cars. He, of course, neglects to tell her about his profession, and he keeps his secret even after he falls in love with her, apparently because she's the only real person he's ever known. Because he loves her, he makes it clear to his boss (Martin Mull) that he's out of the killing business for good. The boss makes it equally clear that men like Spencer can't just walk away; they're killers for life, plain and simple.Flash forward three years. Spencer and Jennifer are now a suburban married couple, the former living a completely different life as a construction contractor, the latter a computer tech. The routine of their ordinary lives drastically changes when their friends, neighbors, and coworkers - all undercover assassins, mind you - come out of the woodwork to try killing Spencer, someone having put a $20 million price on his head. Unable to keep the secret of his past any longer, he and Jennifer go on the run. We now must endure a balancing act between bland, routine action sequences and long, moronic stretches of domestic squabbling, made worse by Jennifer's ignorance in all things spy related. The inevitable showdown sequence ends with a speech that's astoundingly out of place, both in terms of comedic tone and dialogue.For a moment, let's forget about the characters and their lines. Let's examine a glaring mistake in the structure of the showdown sequence. It takes place in Spencer and Jennifer's house, and it involves a number of people running around with very heavy and very loud weapons, which are freely used. All this is happening at the same time as the annual neighborhood block party, held directly on the street. Did the assassins conveniently forget that, by shooting up a house, they're likely to attract the attention of the neighbors, who in turn would likely call the police and have them send someone, forever ruining their chance at $20 million? Maybe it's the other way around, the neighbors miraculously unable to hear the deafening gunshots and screams emanating from Spencer's house.""Killers"" wasn't screened for critics prior to its release date. I now understand why. There's something extraterrestrial about it, mostly in the way it so desperately tries to blend spy action and domestic comedy, neither genre having any business being together in the same movie. Katherine Heigl, who seems nice enough and who I generally like as an actress, is here so awkward that she seems not like a character but rather like a lost child trying to navigate her way back to her mommy's hand.

However, like in any good spy movie, all is not what it seems...as we find out in due course.There is a lot of noisy gunfire and explosions and the screen karate sequences a la Holywood are not bad. No sound suppressed teflon coated weapons here in the action sequences. Art imitates life, but in real life, hand to hand combat is not so elegant and stylish but more nasty, crude and deadly.

Suddenly, the properly paranoid Spencer finds danger around every corner, and finds himself with plenty of explaining to do, as he and Jen go on the run.""Killers"" plays out as an interesting combination of romantic comedy and action thriller, verging at times on broad farce.  Spencer and Jen dodge threats while debating the status of their marriage.  Heigl and Aston Kutcher as Spencer are a good combination, nicely complemented by Selleck and O'Hara.

The premise behind it seems to be to dress up a dark, Coen Brothers style black comedy with a coat of slick, rom-com veneer, and while that's not wholly successfully, it's well-played by the two leads and never boring.  The action scenes may not be thrilling, but they're executed in a cartoon-y fashion that doesn't distract by being overly violent.  Katherine Heigl plays that Hollywood mainstay; the gratingly insecure knockout.  She's quite good at it, too, and when the story jumps ahead in time, she's believably more confident and secure.  Ashton Kutcher always strikes me as a little smug, but he's likable.  Normally, watching couples squabble onscreen is always draining, even when it's supposed to be funny (see the aforementioned Date Night), but I didn't mind it here.  The two have a strong chemistry.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Jen Kornfeldt just got dumped by her boyfriend, and it's partly because Jen isn't adventurous enough for his taste, too cautious, too fuddy-duddy. She and her very judgmental parents (Catherine O'Hara, Tom Selleck) go holidaying in the south of France, partly to assuage Jen's heartache. In Nice, Jen bumps into Spencer, this charming hunk of a guy. Sparks fly. Whirlwind romance. Swift wedding. The whole mushy works.Spencer isn't the straight arrow guy Jen thinks he is. Spencer is, instead, a highly skilled government-sanctioned hit man. Except that when Spencer meets Jen, he really does fall in love with her. Wanting a crack at normalcy, he gives up the assassin's life, in spite of ominous threats issued by his handler.Three years later, basking in marital bliss, living in suburban paradise, Spencer learns that the agency hasn't forgotten him. KILLERS then tells of Spencer and Jen's very long day, rife with domestic disputes, career obligations, parental interference... and lots of frantically dodging hordes of hit men. I guess, for a twenty million dollar bounty, I'd take a shot at Spencer myself. For Spencer, that assassins are coming out of the woodwork all wetworksy pales to insignificance when compared to just how the hell is he going to explain all this to Jen without getting the cold freeze? Or that's the tone the film achieves, anyway.KILLERS tries for a bit of that ROMANCING THE STONE magic, comes off as a lightweight incarnation of MR. & MRS. SMITH. That this vehicle is found wanting isn't the actors' fault, not really. Three of the four core performers are really good, even Ashton Kutcher who's going for his first action role. Katherine Heigl is still very much in her element, even with the film's tone tottering between romantic comedy and espionage thriller. Heigl is expert and very appealing at playing the naturally sexy girl stricken with a palpable touch of insecurity and dorkiness. This comes into play early in the film, and it's too bad that Heigl seems to lose that sense of vulnerability as the story progresses. Her killer chemistry with Kutcher fuels the narrative. It's certainly not the unsnappy dialogue.Catherine O'Hara and Tom Selleck are those parents who are absolutely nightmarish to meet for any prospective boyfriend. O'Hara does her usual over-the-top schtick but it's offset by Selleck's wonderfully deadpan performance. Selleck is perfect for the disapproving fatherly part, and he intimidatingly looms over Kutcher (I'm a bit biased about Tom Selleck; he's a favorite actor).I guess, SPOILERS for this next paragraph:I'm a laid back ""critic,"" so ultimately, I find enough to like about the movie to marginally recommend it. Mostly it's because I like the cast and the always catchy premise. Maybe the best permutation of this premise is TRUE LIES or maybe GROSSE POINTE BLANK, although I'm also very partial to MR. & MRS. SMITH and PRIZZI'S HONOR. In a nutshell, KILLERS looks gorgeous and feels shallow. The screenplay is bland and cliched. The action bits don't exactly get me off my seat. Several plot points felt off. For one thing, I didn't like that there's this underlying ugliness regarding the who and why of the person responsible for putting the hit on Spencer. But maybe my biggest beef is the shedding of whatever element of surprise there is in the movie. At that point, that sense of believability, already compromised, also gives up the ghost. It makes some sense, I suppose, that Spencer's neighbors would comprise some of the bounty hunters - but every friggin' one of them? (Okay, I guess the fence lady isn't a contract killer, she's just really annoying.) The very first attempt at Spencer is startling and effective because you don't expect it, because it isn't telegraphed. But the hits after that, and the fact that it turns out every damn neighbor introduced earlier is gunning for him... Man, the sheer repetitiveness of it is brutal. The doses of sturm und drang - dreary and uninspired - tend to drag down the film. Sturm und drag.

1306117,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B002ZG984Q,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[5, 7]","""Killers"" is definitely not a ""killer"" movie of any kind. In fact, it is really a parody of a movie about killers, unless we're talking killer looks. Katherine Heigl is drop-dead gorgeous; Ashton Kutcher is well, pretty much handsome. Although her character says his body is gorgeous, I say, Pump up some more, Dude! And how old are you now--40--and still wearing a teen hairstyle? Dude!OK, the killer line is ""I work for the blah-blah-blah and I have a license to blah,"" an almost winning reason to see this shuck of a film, but not enough. How about the spy game? Is it action-oriented enough to see? Got some Bond action? Tame for Kutcher on both counts: action and sex. In fact, Kutcher hardly notices Heigl's body (which she readily shows in showy clothes). Obviously, Demi makes him wear invisible blinders. Action? Get this: He swims out to the yacht (to plant a bomb) in midday, climbs up a giant chain and plants that ol' bomb right there as if no one will see him. Takes a guy down into the water with him. Swims back in time for his date with Heigl's spoiled, innocent character. (She has been dumped and her parents take her on a nice vacation to Nice, France).Meets the gorgeous Kutcher character. They fall in love. He walks away from the blah-blah-blah and they live happily ever after--well, make that three years when a contract--out of the blue--is placed on him and EVERYONE tries to kill him. You see, it's an open contract for 20 million dollars!Am I spoilin' here? I don't think so. None of it makes much sense. The film is just a fun vehicle for Kutcher and Heigl. Oh, did I say that Kutcher is a co-producer, making him a controller on content. Although the film is rated PG-13, I took my 11-year-old great-nephew and 12-going-on-30-year old great-niece, who both enjoyed it. The boy rated it 10 out of 10, the girl 8 out of 10. Her taste is obviously more discerning.The violence is so unrealistic that only a timid puppy would be frightened. The one thing I didn't like was the unrealistic drinking by Heigl's mother's character (Catherine O'Hara). Her drink of the morning, as she continues to add vodka to her bloody mary mix in a pitcher, is the entire pitcher. Now that I think of it, just more of the unrealistic nonsense. More parody.Let's just call this movie a romantic comedy infused with silly, over-the-top spy violence, adolescent style, or even 11-year-old style.Did I mention that Tom Selleck has a minor speaking role in this silliness? He can do better, but I bet he had a good time. They did film in Nice, or so it appears. I recognized the highway by the sea.(Footnote: Like my niece, I rate this summer film 8 out of 10. In fact, it was a pleasant adventure which I always provide for my nieces and nephew every summer. Last summer,G-Force (Single Disc Widescreen),Cars (Widescreen Edition)the year before, andSpeed Racer: The Next Generation - The Fast Tracktwo years before that. Notice a deviation in theme? I took the two older ones to an older rated movie. Soon I will take all four, including the 3- and 5-year-olds to see the new Shrek movie.)",3,"Well,  what can I say about this fluff?",1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,3095,"['Killers', 'definitely', 'not', 'killer', 'movie', 'kind', 'fact', 'really', 'parody', 'movie', 'killers', ""'re"", 'talking', 'killer', 'looks', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'handsome', 'character', 'body', 'gorgeous', 'say', 'Pump', 'up', 'more', 'Dude', 'how', 'old', 'are', 'now', '40', 'still', 'wearing', 'teen', 'hairstyle', 'Dude', 'OK', 'killer', 'line', 'work', 'blah-blah-blah', 'have', 'license', 'blah', 'almost', 'winning', 'reason', 'see', 'shuck', 'film', 'not', 'enough', 'How', 'spy', 'game', 'action-oriented', 'enough', 'see', 'Got', 'Bond', 'action', 'Tame', 'Kutcher', 'counts', 'action', 'sex', 'fact', 'Kutcher', 'hardly', 'Heigl', 'body', 'readily', 'showy', 'clothes', 'Obviously', 'Demi', 'wear', 'invisible', 'blinders', 'Action', 'Get', 'out', 'yacht', 'plant', 'bomb', 'midday', 'up', 'giant', 'chain', 'plants', 'ol', 'bomb', 'right', 'there', 'one', 'will', 'see', 'Takes', 'guy', 'down', 'water', 'Swims', 'back', 'time', 'date', 'Heigl', 'spoiled', 'innocent', 'character', 'been', 'dumped', 'parents', 'take', 'nice', 'vacation', 'Nice', 'France', 'gorgeous', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'fall', 'love', 'away', 'blah-blah-blah', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'well', 'make', 'three', 'years', 'when', 'contract', 'blue', 'placed', 'EVERYONE', 'kill', 'see', 'open', 'contract', '20', 'million', 'dollars', 'Am', 'spoilin', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'None', 'much', 'sense', 'film', 'just', 'fun', 'vehicle', 'Kutcher', 'Heigl', 'Oh', 'did', 'say', 'Kutcher', 'co-producer', 'making', 'controller', 'content', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'took', '11-year-old', 'great-nephew', '12-going-on-30-year', 'old', 'great-niece', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'boy', 'rated', '10', '10', 'girl', '8', '10', 'taste', 'obviously', 'more', 'discerning.The', 'violence', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'only', 'timid', 'puppy', 'would', 'be', 'frightened', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'drinking', 'Heigl', 'mother', 'character', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'drink', 'morning', 'add', 'vodka', 'bloody', 'mary', 'mix', 'pitcher', 'entire', 'pitcher', 'Now', 'think', 'just', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'nonsense', 'More', 'parody.Let', 'just', 'call', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'infused', 'silly', 'over-the-top', 'spy', 'violence', 'adolescent', 'style', 'even', '11-year-old', 'style.Did', 'mention', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'minor', 'speaking', 'role', 'silliness', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'bet', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'did', 'film', 'Nice', 'so', 'recognized', 'highway', 'sea', 'Footnote', 'niece', 'rate', 'summer', 'film', '8', '10', 'fact', 'was', 'pleasant', 'adventure', 'always', 'provide', 'nieces', 'nephew', 'summer', 'Last', 'summer', 'G-Force', 'Single', 'Disc', 'Widescreen', 'Cars', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'year', 'andSpeed', 'Racer', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Fast', 'Tracktwo', 'years', 'Notice', 'deviation', 'theme', 'took', 'two', 'older', 'ones', 'older', 'rated', 'movie', 'Soon', 'will', 'take', 'four', 'including', '3-', '5-year-olds', 'see', 'new', 'Shrek', 'movie']",N/A

However, for me at least, it was bad in a good way.  :p  As said by many others, the chemistry was just non-existent, the plot predictable, and the movie just far-fetched. Well add plot wholes that are 100miles in diameter, a very bizarre sense of humor, and a lot of OMG did they just go there? moments, and you got Killers!!! :pSeriously, I sat there the whole time going ""I can't believe that just happened."" or ""I can't believe they just said that.""  But somehow its all just so darn ridiculous its funny.  Catharine O'Hara, for me, was the only good part of the movie, and even her role is just WOW.  It's just so dang ridiculous, words cannot describe, and some of the lines are just awesome like: ""Do you really wanne poke mamma bear?""  :p  Maybe that's funny to me b/c my best friend says that, and has said it while pregnant, so I just found a lot of Heigl's lines darn hilarious.  And part of this is also because of her delivery, she does have great comic timing, though Ahston Kutcher really dragged it down for me, he just wasn't funny, at all with her, but by himself he was a lot better.Is this a good movie?

1306140,A3RFCBJ6U5DLFN,B002ZG984Q,MisterMusicFan,"[3, 4]","Katherine Heigl's breasts and Ashton Kutcher's pecs are the real stars here, since they're by far the most appealing things in `Killers,' an almost entirely flat action-comedy. Katherine Heigl once again plays herself, the gorgeous-and-perfect-yet-not-gorgeous-and-perfect-enough-to-keep-a-boyfriend girl, this time named Jen Kornfeldt. What's unfortunate is that this time around, Heigl's usually persistently irresistible charm isn't enough to keep things afloat. Kutcher, meanwhile, makes an attempt to go for something different but ends up also utterly and completely playing himself (the occasionally lovable, occasionally obnoxious goofball who's altogether impossible to take seriously).Jen is, for some inexplicable reason, on a vacation to Nice, France with her parents immediately following a not very thoroughly explained breakup. While there, she naturally happens to run into a well-toned and half-naked CIA agent who decides to romantically pursue her. Why Kutcher's character, Spencer, takes any interest at all in Heigl's, given her behavior upon meeting him, is dumbfounding.Fast forward years later, and the two have married and settled into a slum of suburban tediousness, with Jen still blissfully unaware of her beau's history of assassinating and Spencer supposedly being done with all this killing brouhaha. Unlucky for him (or for the audience) the story continues when seemingly friendly members of his plucky neighborhood start trying to off him during block parties and business meetings. Jen of course then finds out that-gasp-she married a government spy, and we head into the same batch of silly nonsense the hundreds of other movies of this type offer.In the likes of `Grey's Anatomy,' `Knocked Up' and '27 Dresses,' Katherine Heigl managed to miraculously break the ordinarily unconvincing pity-me pretty girl mold by playing genuinely relatable, sympathetic characters. She sadly fails here, in what is probably her first wholeheartedly bad movie; although `The Ugly Truth' had definite ups and downs and was widely panned by critics, it had far more heart and laughs than this miserably vanilla attempt at a romp. Almost none of the jokes click, and the movie never goes anywhere (literally and figuratively, in fact; minus the brief Nice sequence, almost the entire movie is confined to the small, stuffy suburb).Ashton Kutcher is, as most people know, only selectively charming, but his trademark goofiness wears thin within seconds here, in spite of this movie's apparent attempt to portray him as suave. Catherine O'Hara is wasted as Jen's one-dimensional alcoholic mother, although ironically she offers most of the only legitimate funny moments in the movie.`Killers' spirals into further depravity as the movie comes to a close with an endless slew of clich&eacute;s-there's the overblown `everyone's out to get us' paranoia, the leading lady vehemently refusing to have any part of her beau's questionable lifestyle when we all know she'll cave in by the movie's end, the not-all-that-surprising `twist,' and of course a Mexican standoff. `Killers' fails in just about every area it can, and is one of the most pristine examples of how drearily rehash-y romcoms have become in recent years. Its stars may be beautiful, but don't be fooled by this confection's wrapping-its true taste leaves much to be desired.",2,A frothy flop,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,3353,"['Katherine', 'Heigl', 'breasts', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'pecs', 'are', 'real', 'stars', 'here', ""'re"", 'far', 'most', 'appealing', 'things', 'Killers', 'almost', 'entirely', 'flat', 'action-comedy', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'once', 'again', 'gorgeous-and-perfect-yet-not-gorgeous-and-perfect-enough-to-keep-a-boyfriend', 'girl', 'time', 'named', 'Jen', 'Kornfeldt', 'What', 'unfortunate', 'time', 'around', 'Heigl', 'usually', 'persistently', 'irresistible', 'charm', ""n't"", 'enough', 'keep', 'things', 'afloat', 'Kutcher', 'meanwhile', 'attempt', 'go', 'something', 'different', 'up', 'also', 'utterly', 'completely', 'playing', 'occasionally', 'lovable', 'occasionally', 'obnoxious', 'goofball', 'who', 'altogether', 'impossible', 'take', 'seriously', '.Jen', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'vacation', 'Nice', 'France', 'parents', 'immediately', 'following', 'not', 'very', 'thoroughly', 'explained', 'breakup', 'there', 'naturally', 'run', 'well-toned', 'half-naked', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'romantically', 'pursue', 'Why', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'Spencer', 'interest', 'Heigl', 'given', 'behavior', 'upon', 'meeting', 'dumbfounding.Fast', 'forward', 'years', 'later', 'two', 'have', 'married', 'settled', 'slum', 'suburban', 'tediousness', 'Jen', 'still', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'beau', 'history', 'assassinating', 'Spencer', 'supposedly', 'being', 'done', 'killing', 'brouhaha', 'Unlucky', 'audience', 'story', 'when', 'seemingly', 'friendly', 'members', 'plucky', 'neighborhood', 'start', 'trying', 'off', 'block', 'parties', 'business', 'meetings', 'Jen', 'course', 'then', 'out', 'that-gasp-she', 'married', 'government', 'spy', 'head', 'same', 'batch', 'silly', 'hundreds', 'other', 'movies', 'type', 'likes', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'Knocked', 'Up', ""'27"", 'Dresses', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'managed', 'miraculously', 'break', 'ordinarily', 'unconvincing', 'pity-me', 'pretty', 'girl', 'mold', 'playing', 'genuinely', 'relatable', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'sadly', 'here', 'what', 'probably', 'first', 'wholeheartedly', 'bad', 'movie', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'had', 'definite', 'ups', 'downs', 'was', 'widely', 'panned', 'critics', 'had', 'far', 'more', 'heart', 'laughs', 'miserably', 'vanilla', 'attempt', 'romp', 'Almost', 'none', 'jokes', 'click', 'movie', 'never', 'anywhere', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'fact', 'brief', 'Nice', 'sequence', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'confined', 'small', 'stuffy', 'suburb', '.Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'only', 'selectively', 'charming', 'trademark', 'goofiness', 'wears', 'seconds', 'here', 'spite', 'movie', 'apparent', 'attempt', 'portray', 'suave', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'wasted', 'Jen', 'one-dimensional', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'ironically', 'most', 'only', 'legitimate', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie.', 'Killers', 'spirals', 'further', 'depravity', 'movie', 'close', 'endless', 'slew', 'clich', 'eacute', 's-there', 'overblown', 'everyone', 'out', 'get', 'paranoia', 'leading', 'lady', 'vehemently', 'refusing', 'have', 'part', 'beau', 'questionable', 'lifestyle', 'when', 'know', ""'ll"", 'cave', 'movie', 'end', 'not-all-that-surprising', 'twist', 'course', 'Mexican', 'standoff', 'Killers', 'fails', 'just', 'area', 'can', 'one', 'most', 'pristine', 'examples', 'how', 'drearily', 'rehash-y', 'romcoms', 'have', 'become', 'recent', 'years', 'stars', 'may', 'be', 'beautiful', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'confection', 'wrapping-its', 'true', 'taste', 'much', 'be', 'desired']",N/A

The story per se could have been ruined had the A-Team moviemakers handled its choice of actors.  Kutcher was as natural and transparent as real person doing the real thing.  His feeling and expressions were innate and candid.  His disciplined mannerism served his image well. Heigl was no les natural and no less beautiful than Kutcher.  She played a real woman who would forgive a killer of the sake of saving her love and her baby.  Her spontaneity made her convey the true feeling of a person confronted with such unexpected twist of life events.The story itself is quite trivial and uninteresting.  Crashing cars, firing guns, and making plenty of explosions, were not as intriguing as the two capable actors showing their best in expressing human feelings during hardships.  Spencer (Kutcher) was desperate of a clean and fresh life, after selling his soul to the devil.  The only one who could offer him such opportunity was a poor, honest, and desperate woman, Jen (Heigl).  You could dismiss all the violence that spices the movie as a distraction, yet you would still enjoy the conflict of two people dreaming to set roots and enjoy life.Spencer needed more than facts and promised in order to convince Jen that could abandon his killing business and behave as a law abiding citizen.

1306167,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B002ZG984Q,Steve,"[1, 2]","Killers is a retread of a formula done many times before, and generally better. The premise of Ashton Kutcher as the hit man who seeks to get out of the business and retire to suburbia but can't quite escape his past is hackneyed on one hand and poor casting on the other. The twist at the end is fairly transparent, especially given the lead-up to it, and the movie suffers from not being funny enough for a comedy and not being imaginative enough for an action movie.On the plus side, however, are Catherine O'Hara and Katherine Heigl. Both have good comic touch (O'Hara is one of the greatest comedic actresses ever) and manage to flesh-out their two-dimensional roles. Tom Selleck plays himself, as he has for his entire career, so take that for what it's worth. It's a shame that O'Hara is given so little to do save have a beverage prop in her hand throughout the movie. Furthermore, it seems very odd that her profoundly alcoholic character is written for laughs. I'm not complaining, because lectures from Hollywood are the height of hypocrisy, but still - is a woman who drinks heavily in every scene really that funny in this day and age?Mr. & Mrs. Smith is the high water mark for this kind of movie because the chemistry was clearly evident, the action was clever and fun, and the banter was well written.

It was almost like the producers were trying too hard to please the audience and what results is a plot suffering from overkill; there are just too many assassins (which is where the title ""Killers"" is derived from)) and the plot twists are played again and again. Still, I have to say Ashton is the draw here. He plays a CIA assassin who falls in love with a beautiful woman who gets embroiled in a series of ""hits"" made on her new husband's life. Tom Selleck has a supporting role playing Ashton's father-in-law and Catherine O'Hara (from ""Beetlejuice"" fame) plays a funny alcoholic.The movie had a huge budget of $75 million dollars, but it only brought in a paltry $92 million making ""Killers"" a modest success.
