226783,A3N0AXNEZVE686,6300247538,Hound Dog,"[2, 4]","For those viewers already familiar with the live-action ""G.I. Joe"" film made a few years ago, one can imagine that movie's mega-million dollar budget.  Now, picture that same kind of movie being made thirty years ago for a few measly dollars and there you would have the schlock classic ""Megaforce."" As an impressionable kid, I was simply wowed by this film's awesome vehicles, the battle scenes, and even its incredibly cheesy storyline.  If you can find this vintage 1980's guy movie for a reasonable price, I highly recommend it for both camp action fans and for the pre-teen boy crowd to enjoy ninety minutes of sheer lame fun and possibly unintentional laughs.Directed by 1970's-80's stunt master Hal Needham, this clunker is actually something of a rarity since Burt Reynolds is absent despite repeatedly teaming up with Needham for ""Smokey & the Bandit;"" ""The Cannonball Run I and II;""""Stroker Ace;"" and the underrated ""Hooper.""  Perhaps Reynolds simply wasn't available or just maybe for once he knew better than to show up here.  Instead, Barry (""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"") Bostwick inexplicably steps in to play hero Colonel Ace Hunter (yes, that is the hero's name) complete with a peroxide blonde pompadour and beard; beige spandex; and even a light blue headband for good measure.  Also appearing are the late Edward (TV's ""Knight Rider"") Mulhare; the late Persis (""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"") Khambatta; and Michael (TV's ""Houston Knights"") Beck, who must be given at least some credit for keeping relatively straight faces throughout this turkey.  Despite the grade-Z script, typecast actor Henry Silva gives a wily effort in yet another turn as a generic villain.The premise involves a super-elite, international anti-terrorist army going into battle to prevent an overseas invasion led by a mercenary ex-crony (Silva) of hero Ace Hunter (Bostwick).  Silva and Bostwick (whose suspiciously squeaky voice suggests it was badly dubbed) make the laugh-out-loud sub-plot involving a stolen cigarette lighter between them worth some good chuckles.  Not to mention Bostwick's utterly hilarious escape to a cargo plane via his flying motorcycle (let's just say it is some pretty primitive blue screen action).  Still, despite the movie's considerable failings, it retains a zany sense of humor that makes one think ""Megaforce"" is really an entertaining spoof of today's big-budget, often mindless action movies.  In that sense, ""Megaforce"" does for action movies what the Zucker Brothers comedies ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" did in wildly ridiculing 1970's disaster and police melodrama genres.Lastly, if you want to set up a cult classic double-feature, a great choice is 1979 TV cult spoof ""Legends of the Super Heroes"" now on DVD featuring Adam (Batman) West and Burt (Robin) Ward in their final appearances as the Dynamic Duo.Rating: 4/5 (Memorable quote from Ace Hunter taunting the villain: ""The good guys always win ... even in the eighties!"").",4,"""Megaforce"" is Really More a Fun ""Megafarce""",1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,2973,"['viewers', 'already', 'familiar', 'live-action', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'film', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'movie', 'mega-million', 'dollar', 'budget', 'Now', 'picture', 'same', 'kind', 'movie', 'being', 'made', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'few', 'measly', 'dollars', 'would', 'have', 'schlock', 'classic', 'Megaforce', 'impressionable', 'kid', 'was', 'simply', 'wowed', 'film', 'awesome', 'vehicles', 'battle', 'scenes', 'even', 'incredibly', 'cheesy', 'storyline', 'can', 'find', 'vintage', '1980', 'guy', 'movie', 'reasonable', 'price', 'highly', 'recommend', 'camp', 'action', 'fans', 'pre-teen', 'boy', 'crowd', 'enjoy', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'sheer', 'lame', 'fun', 'possibly', 'unintentional', 'laughs.Directed', ""1970's-80"", 'stunt', 'master', 'Hal', 'Needham', 'clunker', 'actually', 'something', 'rarity', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'absent', 'repeatedly', 'teaming', 'up', 'Needham', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'Cannonball', 'Run', 'II', 'Stroker', 'Ace', 'underrated', 'Hooper', 'Perhaps', 'Reynolds', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'just', 'maybe', 'once', 'knew', 'better', 'show', 'up', 'here', 'Instead', 'Barry', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Bostwick', 'inexplicably', 'play', 'hero', 'Colonel', 'Ace', 'Hunter', 'yes', 'hero', 'name', 'complete', 'peroxide', 'pompadour', 'beard', 'spandex', 'even', 'light', 'blue', 'headband', 'good', 'measure', 'Also', 'appearing', 'are', 'late', 'Edward', 'TV', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'Mulhare', 'late', 'Persis', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Khambatta', 'Michael', 'TV', 'Houston', 'Knights', 'Beck', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'least', 'credit', 'keeping', 'relatively', 'straight', 'turkey', 'grade-Z', 'script', 'typecast', 'actor', 'Henry', 'Silva', 'wily', 'effort', 'yet', 'turn', 'generic', 'villain.The', 'premise', 'super-elite', 'international', 'anti-terrorist', 'army', 'going', 'battle', 'prevent', 'overseas', 'invasion', 'led', 'mercenary', 'ex-crony', 'Silva', 'hero', 'Ace', 'Hunter', 'Bostwick', 'Silva', 'Bostwick', 'suspiciously', 'squeaky', 'voice', 'was', 'badly', 'dubbed', 'make', 'laugh-out-loud', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'stolen', 'cigarette', 'lighter', 'good', 'chuckles', 'Not', 'mention', 'Bostwick', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'escape', 'cargo', 'plane', 'flying', 'motorcycle', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'pretty', 'primitive', 'blue', 'screen', 'action', 'Still', 'movie', 'considerable', 'failings', 'zany', 'sense', 'humor', 'one', 'think', 'Megaforce', 'really', 'entertaining', 'spoof', 'today', 'big-budget', 'often', 'mindless', 'action', 'movies', 'sense', 'Megaforce', 'action', 'movies', 'what', 'Zucker', 'Brothers', 'Airplane', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'did', 'wildly', 'ridiculing', '1970', 'disaster', 'police', 'melodrama', 'genres.Lastly', 'want', 'set', 'up', 'cult', 'classic', 'double-feature', 'great', 'choice', '1979', 'TV', 'cult', 'spoof', 'Legends', 'Super', 'Heroes', 'now', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'Adam', 'Batman', 'West', 'Burt', 'Robin', 'Ward', 'final', 'appearances', 'Dynamic', 'Duo.Rating', '4/5', 'Memorable', 'quote', 'Ace', 'Hunter', 'taunting', 'villain', 'good', 'guys', 'always', 'win', 'even', 'eighties']",N/A

Fans of this 1982 film can finally breathe a sigh of relief!As for the film itself, it was supposed to have been one of the big releases during the summer of 1982 and managed to have toys as well as an Atari 2600 game released alongside the film. Asian studio Golden Harvest (who made and released most of Jackie Chan's classic films during the 80's and early to mid 90's) sunk 20 million dollars into Megaforce and were viewing it as their big attempt to break into American big summer release filmmaking but the movie tanked in spectacular fashion grossing less than 6 million dollars. By any definition of what makes a truly good movie, Megaforce is pretty bad. But for lovers like myself of cheesy movies that are so bad that they wind up being hugely entertaining, Megaforce is a B movie fan's dream. The movie has its fans though and have had to put up with years of horrible VHS quality bootleg DVD's and it seemed like the movie had completely fallen by the wayside and would never see a proper release of any kind.The DVD by Hen's Tooth Video was done from the original camera negative and presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic video. If your HDTV has some kind of ""screen fit"" option instead of 16:9, it will still fill up your screen and is how I recommend watching it so that no picture information is cropped off. The picture quality is very high quality with nice color saturation throughout. While it's a small shame that they didn't also do a blu-ray release too, the DVD looks great and is like seeing the movie for the 1st time all over again. There had been a Dutch DVD a few years back that was widescreen but it wasn't anamorphic so hats off to Hen's Tooth Video for finally giving this film a proper release. The sound is in 2 channel stereo and there are also English subtitles too. One odd thing with the audio is that it is for some reason pitched higher than it should be. Why this occured I have no idea but it isn't overly distracting to me at least. Sadly, the release is completely barebones with not even the theatrical trailer being listed. But considering that I thought that we would never get an official release of this film on DVD at all, I'm not going to complain much at all.So I highly recommend that fans pick up the DVD and let's hope that an eventual blu ray release will occur at some point in the near future.

Because it was made in the 80s there is no CG just very obvious photoshop and bad set designs.  The plot line is some unknown middle eastern (I assume) army being harrassed by a gloriously bad mercenary and they reach out to our heros for help.  Our heros are members of an elite, unknown special forces with all the good toys band of soldiers.  They even have their own James Bond type Q.

It is just so darn full of bad special effects, bad acting, bad costumes, bad dialoge and bad jokes that you just can't help but love it.There have been a number of reviews that mention the DVD itself was flawed but possibly was re-mastered because we had no problems with it on a Blu-ray player.Anyone who enjoys a good old fashioned romp with men in skin tight leotards, futuristic toys which are badly disguised tanks, motocyles and guns, explosions and crashes, cheesy acting and a bad script, this is your movie.",4,A good campy movie for a rainy day,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,1558,"['have', 'been', 'haunting', 'sites', 'sell', 'DVDs', 'years', 'waiting', 'movie', 'be', 'released', 'been', 'VHS', 'awhile', 'reason', 'took', 'while', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'examples', '80s', 'camp', 'around', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'skin', 'tight', 'gold', 'lame', 'gold', 'headband', 'blond', 'locks', 'flowing', 'riding', 'around', 'souped', 'up', 'motorcycle', 'grinning', 'belief', 'was', 'made', '80s', 'CG', 'just', 'very', 'obvious', 'photoshop', 'bad', 'set', 'designs', 'plot', 'line', 'unknown', 'middle', 'eastern', 'assume', 'army', 'being', 'harrassed', 'gloriously', 'bad', 'mercenary', 'reach', 'out', 'heros', 'help', 'heros', 'are', 'members', 'elite', 'unknown', 'special', 'forces', 'good', 'toys', 'band', 'soldiers', 'even', 'have', 'own', 'James', 'Bond', 'type', 'Q', 'acting', 'movie', 'so', 'campy', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'entire', 'time', 'are', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'meant', 'be', 'camp', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'most', 'likely', 'HBO', 'fell', 'love', 'just', 'so', 'darn', 'full', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'costumes', 'bad', 'dialoge', 'bad', 'jokes', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'it.There', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'reviews', 'mention', 'DVD', 'was', 'flawed', 'possibly', 'was', 're-mastered', 'had', 'problems', 'Blu-ray', 'player.Anyone', 'who', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'romp', 'men', 'skin', 'tight', 'leotards', 'futuristic', 'toys', 'are', 'badly', 'disguised', 'tanks', 'motocyles', 'guns', 'explosions', 'crashes', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'bad', 'script', 'movie']",N/A

And when I was thirteen, man, that song was cool. Obviously, I wanted to see the movie. But I never got around to it; I don't remember whether it didn't play in Pittsburgh long enough for me to get there or whether I couldn't convince anyone to go with me. It's almost thirty years later, and I've finally seen the movie; I now suspect the latter reason.Ace Hunter (Barry Bostwick, whose career has been reduced to doing crap like Hannah Montana: The Movie) is the head of MegaForce, a high-tech mercenary unit. They get involved in a border war between two mythical middle eastern countries at the behest of Edward Byrne-White (Edward Mulhare, slumming it) and his sidekick Major Zara (Persis Khambatta, who looked damned good in a uniform). You've seen two or three eighties action movies, you know what's going to happen here. And it does. The only difference between this and a generic Schwarzenegger flick is the high-tech gadgets, which look incredibly dated now, and that fact that no one could persuade Schwarzenegger to lend his pecs to the production. There's a great turn by Henry Silva (The Manchurian Candidate, Ghost Dog) as the villain, but other than that, you're better off avoiding this turkey. Laughable script, wooden acting, bad special effects. I'm amazed the Sci-Fi Channel isn't showing it regularly, it's right up their alley. *",1,Megabore.,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,1588,"['MegaForce', 'Hal', 'Needham', '1982', 'When', 'was', 'high', 'school', '707', 'end', 'title', 'track', 'flick', 'was', 'one', 'songs', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'light', 'rotation', 'local', 'hard', 'rock', 'station', 'got', 'play', ""'d"", 'catch', 'maybe', 'once', 'month', 'when', 'was', 'thirteen', 'man', 'song', 'was', 'cool', 'Obviously', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'never', 'got', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'Pittsburgh', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'there', 'could', ""n't"", 'convince', 'anyone', 'go', 'almost', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'seen', 'movie', 'now', 'suspect', 'latter', 'reason.Ace', 'Hunter', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'career', 'been', 'reduced', 'doing', 'crap', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'Movie', 'head', 'MegaForce', 'high-tech', 'mercenary', 'unit', 'get', 'involved', 'border', 'war', 'two', 'mythical', 'middle', 'eastern', 'countries', 'behest', 'Edward', 'Byrne-White', 'Edward', 'Mulhare', 'slumming', 'sidekick', 'Major', 'Zara', 'Persis', 'Khambatta', 'who', 'looked', 'damned', 'good', 'uniform', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'three', 'eighties', 'action', 'movies', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'here', 'only', 'difference', 'generic', 'Schwarzenegger', 'flick', 'high-tech', 'gadgets', 'look', 'incredibly', 'dated', 'now', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'persuade', 'Schwarzenegger', 'lend', 'pecs', 'production', 'great', 'turn', 'Henry', 'Silva', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'villain', 'other', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'avoiding', 'turkey', 'Laughable', 'script', 'wooden', 'acting', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', ""n't"", 'showing', 'regularly', 'right', 'up', 'alley', '*']",N/A
