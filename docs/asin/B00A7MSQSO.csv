Davis and Gyllenhaal try their hardest to keep this movie above float, but my main problem with this movie is I felt nothing special or important took place. Basically just a bunch of stressed out, unmotivated teachers bickering back and forth. Rosie Perez and Holly Hunter also give good performances, but sometimes even when four top actress' make a movie together, the storyline and plot tends to be nonexistent. There's a touching scene with Davis and her young son towards the end of the movie, that was probably the only time in the film that brought a tear to my eye. Won't Back Down isn't a horrible drama, but I have to admit that it's not really memorable either.

1606361,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00A7MSQSO,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","If not for the emotional resiliency of the two lead actresses, this 2012 feel-good drama about the reformation of a failing inner-city Pittsburgh school would come across as no more than a polemic. However, Maggie Gyllenhaal (The Dark Knight) and Viola Davis (The Help) bring enough intense fervor to their roles of parent and teacher that this becomes a creditable film if not all that memorable. Director and co-screenwriter Daniel Barnz doesn't help matters much by stacking the deck so predictably in the script (co-written with Brin Hill) while tackling a serious exposition problem with a lot of education jargon that feels like it requires the viewer to take some preparation exam to watch it. Watching Davis Guggenheim's 2010 documentary,Waiting for 'Superman', is probably helpful since it covers similar territory by showing how students strive to become accepted into a charter school.The plot here takes a more contrived route as it focuses on Jamie, a single mom holding down two jobs while becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of attention her eight-year-old, Malia, receives from her teachers in treating her dyslexia and dealing with bullies. Through happenstance, she finds a little-known piece of legislation based on California's ""parent trigger"" law, which allows parents and teachers, under certain circumstances and after rounds of approvals, to take over schools and run them entirely. This motivates Jamie to partner with Nona, a teacher at Malia's school, who has similar frustrations from an insider's perspective but has been stymied time and again by the system. The movie then takes us on their journey running through all the bureaucratic red tape that you would expect from an inspirationally-minded drama.I give credit to Barnz and Hill for at least presenting a compelling argument against the cause by showing how the teachers' union would suffer major setbacks along the way. As Jamie, Gyllenhaal does her best work since her compelling turn as the struggling drug addict-mother in 2006'sSherrybaby. She brings loose-limbed passion to her character's relentless drive toward realizing a charter school for her daughter. At first, Davis appears underserved by the script, but this actress has no problem conveying the gravitas and compassion needed to make Nona's evolution feel realistic. As Evelyn, the president of the teachers' union, Holly Hunter (Broadcast News) - who would have likely played Jamie a couple of decades ago - brings palpable conviction to her character's increasing moral conflict. It's good to see Rosie Perez (Fearless) again onscreen as Nona's sympathetic fellow teacher. Other supporting turns amount to stereotypes as dictated by the script. The subject of the film is quite worthwhile, but the treatment needed far more texture.",3,Two Fine Actresses Lend Heart to a Jargon-Heavy Drama About Charter Schools and Parent Trigger Laws,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,2801,"['not', 'emotional', 'resiliency', 'two', 'lead', 'actresses', '2012', 'feel-good', 'drama', 'reformation', 'failing', 'inner-city', 'Pittsburgh', 'school', 'would', 'come', 'more', 'polemic', 'However', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Help', 'bring', 'enough', 'intense', 'fervor', 'roles', 'parent', 'teacher', 'creditable', 'film', 'not', 'memorable', 'Director', 'co-screenwriter', 'Daniel', 'Barnz', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'much', 'stacking', 'deck', 'so', 'predictably', 'script', 'co-written', 'Brin', 'Hill', 'tackling', 'serious', 'exposition', 'problem', 'lot', 'education', 'jargon', 'viewer', 'take', 'preparation', 'exam', 'watch', 'Watching', 'Davis', 'Guggenheim', '2010', 'documentary', 'Waiting', ""'Superman"", 'probably', 'helpful', 'similar', 'territory', 'showing', 'how', 'students', 'strive', 'become', 'accepted', 'charter', 'school.The', 'plot', 'here', 'more', 'contrived', 'route', 'Jamie', 'single', 'mom', 'holding', 'down', 'two', 'jobs', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'concerned', 'lack', 'attention', 'eight-year-old', 'Malia', 'teachers', 'treating', 'dyslexia', 'dealing', 'bullies', 'happenstance', 'little-known', 'piece', 'legislation', 'based', 'California', 'parent', 'trigger', 'law', 'parents', 'teachers', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'rounds', 'approvals', 'take', 'over', 'schools', 'run', 'entirely', 'Jamie', 'partner', 'Nona', 'teacher', 'Malia', 'school', 'who', 'similar', 'frustrations', 'insider', 'perspective', 'been', 'stymied', 'time', 'again', 'system', 'movie', 'then', 'journey', 'running', 'bureaucratic', 'red', 'tape', 'would', 'expect', 'inspirationally-minded', 'drama.I', 'give', 'credit', 'Barnz', 'Hill', 'least', 'presenting', 'compelling', 'argument', 'cause', 'showing', 'how', 'teachers', 'union', 'would', 'suffer', 'major', 'setbacks', 'way', 'Jamie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'best', 'work', 'compelling', 'turn', 'struggling', 'drug', 'addict-mother', ""2006'sSherrybaby"", 'loose-limbed', 'passion', 'character', 'relentless', 'drive', 'realizing', 'charter', 'school', 'daughter', 'first', 'Davis', 'underserved', 'script', 'actress', 'problem', 'conveying', 'gravitas', 'compassion', 'needed', 'make', 'Nona', 'evolution', 'feel', 'realistic', 'Evelyn', 'president', 'teachers', 'union', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'played', 'Jamie', 'couple', 'decades', 'brings', 'palpable', 'conviction', 'character', 'increasing', 'moral', 'conflict', 'good', 'see', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'Fearless', 'again', 'onscreen', 'Nona', 'sympathetic', 'fellow', 'teacher', 'Other', 'supporting', 'turns', 'amount', 'stereotypes', 'dictated', 'script', 'subject', 'film', 'quite', 'worthwhile', 'treatment', 'needed', 'far', 'more', 'texture']",Won't Back Down

After 38 years of teaching, it amazes me that there are still teachers, schools, districts that are lackadaisical and need a good 'kick-in-th-pants' to provide what the kids need.  The actors in this film show the extreme of what can be done, and do such a good job of showing the dedicated and the undedicated in a wonderful profession.

Nona Alberts (Viola Davis) and Jamie Fitzpatrick (Maggie Gyllenhaal) work together to change things for the better. Although there is fear and doubt at times, these two women fight with teachers, the school board and parents, not just for the education and futures of their children but for every child attending this inner-city school.Children are being sent to school but they're not learning anything. A dyslexic little girl is struggling and she gets no help at all. It was disappointing to see educators who didn't care about their students. And the first scene - very bothersome.Nona and Jamie: I liked the characters, and I was rooting for them till the end.

There were scenes of alcohol drinking, and the mother does work in a bar.  The mother dresses skimpy and does not wear a bra.The story is based on true events about parents fed up with tenured teachers only being ""in it"" for the pay.  The teachers portrayed in this movie weren't teaching.  They were not concerned with children learning.  And the children would be passed to the next grade without really knowing a whole lot.  Not being able to read was the main topic.The movie really opened up viewers eyes to the topic of the teachers union backing up their members, but not really caring that their members weren't teaching. As long as the union had the financial support of the teachers they were in business.  If the parents took over the school then how would the union collect dues?

The reality is this movie is simple and naive.A single mom has a daughter w/ dyslexia and her school doesn't help her; a viable story line that ends in a mixture of feel good platitudes.Maggie Gyllenhaal dances through the film likes she's a wind up toy trying too hard to be sincere. From the beginning we see a school raffle where parents are pit against each other to win seats in an out of district school and naturally our heroine loses the raffle and decides to buck the system. Ving Rhames makes a cardboard cameo as the cliched deep voiced African-American school-administrator-in-a-suit who talks tough (in a deep voice of course) and then disappears never to be seen again.Gyllenhaal is a ditzy single mom who works as a bartender by night and receptionist by day (by-the-way where is her child's father?) She says she can't afford to move to a better school district but we never hear why that is. So she focuses on the hunky male teacher who she's convinced he's a great teacher b/c he entertaining to the kids.The reticent teachers who balk at the idea of creating a new school are portrayed as an unruly mob of interrupting, bored fools. The board members who have to vote on the new school idea are shown as non-interested stuffed suits; self-interested or simply not interested.Holly Hunter is wasted as a once-motivated-school-adminstrator who is now burned out but at the end she will volunteer to teach in the new school.Nowhere is the obvious mentioned.-If you want your children to be better students, be better parents. Turn off the TV, take the kids to the library, be a good role model, buy a few books etc.-If you're a single parent maybe you should move in w/ your parents, family members etc to find a more stable living arrangement for your child.Unfortunately some people will believe this film is proper reflection of what goes on in big city schools. Too many parents lack the self-esteem to be good role models to their children. they send their kids to the local school and hope for the best. When things go bad parents throw up their hands in despair and throw more money at he schools. The fault lies not so much in the multi-level bureaucracy than in our reliance on that bureaucracy to solve our problems.",1,"foolishly optimistic, goofy",1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,2286,"['preview', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'reality', 'movie', 'simple', 'naive.A', 'single', 'mom', 'daughter', 'w/', 'dyslexia', 'school', ""n't"", 'help', 'viable', 'story', 'line', 'mixture', 'feel', 'good', 'platitudes.Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'film', 'wind', 'up', 'toy', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'sincere', 'beginning', 'see', 'school', 'raffle', 'where', 'parents', 'are', 'pit', 'other', 'win', 'seats', 'out', 'district', 'school', 'naturally', 'heroine', 'raffle', 'decides', 'buck', 'system', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'cardboard', 'cameo', 'cliched', 'deep', 'voiced', 'African-American', 'school-administrator-in-a-suit', 'who', 'tough', 'deep', 'voice', 'course', 'then', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again.Gyllenhaal', 'ditzy', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'bartender', 'night', 'receptionist', 'day', 'by-the-way', 'where', 'child', 'father', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'move', 'better', 'school', 'district', 'never', 'hear', 'why', 'hunky', 'male', 'teacher', 'who', 'convinced', 'great', 'teacher', 'b/c', 'entertaining', 'kids.The', 'reticent', 'teachers', 'who', 'balk', 'idea', 'creating', 'new', 'school', 'are', 'portrayed', 'unruly', 'mob', 'interrupting', 'bored', 'fools', 'board', 'members', 'who', 'have', 'vote', 'new', 'school', 'idea', 'are', 'shown', 'non-interested', 'stuffed', 'suits', 'self-interested', 'simply', 'not', 'interested.Holly', 'Hunter', 'wasted', 'once-motivated-school-adminstrator', 'who', 'now', 'burned', 'out', 'end', 'will', 'volunteer', 'teach', 'new', 'school.Nowhere', 'obvious', 'mentioned.-If', 'want', 'children', 'be', 'better', 'students', 'be', 'better', 'parents', 'Turn', 'off', 'TV', 'take', 'kids', 'library', 'be', 'good', 'role', 'model', 'buy', 'few', 'books', 'etc.-If', ""'re"", 'single', 'parent', 'maybe', 'should', 'move', 'w/', 'parents', 'family', 'members', 'etc', 'find', 'more', 'stable', 'living', 'arrangement', 'child.Unfortunately', 'people', 'will', 'believe', 'film', 'proper', 'reflection', 'what', 'big', 'city', 'schools', 'Too', 'many', 'parents', 'lack', 'self-esteem', 'be', 'good', 'role', 'models', 'children', 'send', 'kids', 'local', 'school', 'hope', 'best', 'When', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'parents', 'throw', 'up', 'hands', 'despair', 'throw', 'more', 'money', 'schools', 'fault', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'multi-level', 'bureaucracy', 'reliance', 'bureaucracy', 'solve', 'problems']",Won't Back Down

1606391,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B00A7MSQSO,S. Der,"[1, 3]","This movie really touch me. It really tells the story of how there are students in school that have learning disabilities or just not ready for the next grade, but would be passed along to the next grade, even if they are not ready for it. The movie would also show that teachers would also check off the students as attending, even if the students were absence to get their funding from the government and not shut down.I liked how it showed two parents worried that their children would end up being just another statistic in school. So, the parents would not stand for this and decided to do something about it. They decided to to fight back the schools and really got their children the real education they needed. The school and union fought the parents every step of the way. They did more work fighting the parents than they ever did doing their own real duties. They really didn't care for the children education and cared more about their own safety of their jobs more than anything. Why should a child be passed along if they really don't understand or learned the material? The bad teachers there and unions just didn't care about that. They just wanted to kept their jobs! Well, that's not right for the children and I was glad that they were gone and lost their jobs in the end.I want to tell a little story about myself. I too had a slight learning disability while in school and I was just being passed along ever grade. I remember those days very well. I just didn't get why other kids got things so fast and I was struggling with the material. I never really got the help I needed in school because there was no real special help that I could get in school. No teacher took the time to really asks me if I got it or not. Even, if I flat out got Ds or Fs I would still get to go to the next grade. The schools that I went to just didn't care. This really made it hard for me in life and when I went to college.I felt I didn't know as much as other people after secondary school and was placed in the remedial classes from the the get go in college, however, I did graduate on time with a high GPA, but it was really difficulty all the way. I had to use all the resources at college and learn from the bottom up and go to professionals open hours ever day it seemed. They actually helped me! I passed!

It was inspired by a California law for failing schools. Pennsylvania does not have such a law as yet.Jamie Fitzpatrick (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a working single mom with a dyslexic daughter (Emily Alyn Lind) who is not getting the attention she needs at school. Unable to move or pay for her child to go to a better school, Jamie joins with a teacher (Viola Davis) in an attempt to take over the school's charter. It is an uphill battle as she must convince apathetic parents. Teachers must also be convinced to give up their union security so they can eliminate substandard teachers with tenure.The struggles portrayed in the film were light compared to reality.

Keep in mind the role of the unions, keep in mind the famous quote of Albert Shanker, president of the United Federation of Teachers from 1964 to 1985 and of the American Federation of Teachers from 1974 to 1997: ""When schoolchildren start paying union dues, that's when I'll start representing the interests of school children"". Remember who the unions work for. Not for your children!!!Also keep in mind the city of Detroit. For people who don't know, in the 40's and the 50's, Detroit was one of the most prosperous cities in the US. Where are they now? And the important question is: why and how a magnificent city like Detroit can be destroyed culturally and financially? The answer is: you destroy the public school system, then families move out and the thugs move in and take over. Who destroyed the public school system in Detroit? Well watch the movie. Oakland, Chicago, and Cleveland are next.Jamie (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a single mother (...what else) who lives in Pittsburgh, works two jobs and takes care of her daughter who has dyslexia. Her daughter doesn't get any help in the school system. In fact, the opening scene represents very well the status of our public education during a normal third grade English class: a teacher sitting at her desk playing on her phone while doing online shopping, ""teaching"" kids who are playing games on their phone or Gameboy that they brought to class while a poor dyslexic girl is trying to read a sentence. The few ""students"" who are not asleep or are not playing on their electronic device are making fun of her. Jamie meets a motivated teacher (Viola Davis) who has her own problems (...of course she is in the process of divorcing) and together they decide to start the process of taking the school over. The story is based on true events that happened in California through which parents can take over a failing public school and turn it into a charter school. The movie happens in Pittsburgh where there are no such laws. Teachers in Pittsburgh, you can relax now...This film is ""not just a movie"". The script shows really well, the thuggish methods of the unions and the pathetic school board who are playing with poor people's lives while their kids most of the time attend private or charter schools. Holly Hunter plays the role of a remorseful union executive who at first is trying to bribe Jamie and at the end regrets her acts and decides to join the new charter school. This is a weakness of the script (minor) since it is not very believable knowing the union people.Five stars all around for the acting, the direction and the script that is as close to reality as possible.
