826312,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000286RPM,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","The second and final reworking of a small picture Martin Scorsese originally directed in 1965 while a student at NYU is technically far from perfect (occasional bad sound or a scene that appears to be from a multi-generational source) and has stretches of inertia or extreme close-ups that go beyond the daring.WH'OS THAT KNOCKING AT MY DOOR? has merit not only as a directorial first effort of an acknowledged master, but for its germination of two ideas Scorsese explored more fully inMEAN STREETS(1973),GOODFELLAS(1990) and to a lesser extent,RAGING BULL(1980): 1.) that male-bonding always takes precedence over man/woman relationships, and 2.) there are two distinct categories of women, as understood by men with a properly guilt-ridden Roman Catholic upbringing.Harvey Keitel's J.R. clearly makes these distinctions here. He professes to his sweetheart that there are ""girls"", the kind of women who are innocent, pure and virginal before marriage, and ""broads"", those that are like the men's room doorknob (everybody gets a turn), labelled by Italian-American guys (like J.R.) as ""hoo-urs"". The first type you marry and enshrine safely at home, the second you freely get down and dirty with in cheesy motel rooms and car back seats. This double standard would have immediate repercussions to his love life.As mentioned above, ""WHO'S THAT KNOCKING..."" has a bifurcated plotline. There's the wolfpack adventures of J.R. and his pals, which are far separated from his private romantic life. This latter relationship goes awry when Zina Bethune (as the anonoymous ""Girl"") confesses to boyfriend J.R., after hearing his ""girls' vs. ""broads"" philosophy, that one night another man forced himself upon her, thus she was no longer chaste. The previously affectionate J.R., who with great effort had refrained from ""doing it"" with ""the Girl"" before marriage, instantly turns bitter and excoriates her as a ""hoo-ur."" He cruelly walks away, their friendship broken.There's no equivalent in J.R.'s interactions with the ""guys"". At times they quarrel, name-call, wrassle and duke it out, but they always remain buddies. Their fun ranges from just hanging around to getting way too drunk to aimlessly cruising the streets to climbing a forested hill outside a small rural town and enjoying the view from its summit.J.R. broods for a while over his ex-sweety, remembers the good moments and especially his mean treatment of her the last time they were together. He eventually comes knocking at 6:30 am. Despite the hour, she's happy to see him and invites J.R. in. One element of a story that has seemed plotless gets resolved in this last scene.",4,The answer to: WHO'S THAT KNOCKING AT MY DOOR?,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,2638,"['second', 'final', 'reworking', 'small', 'picture', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'originally', 'directed', '1965', 'student', 'NYU', 'technically', 'far', 'perfect', 'occasional', 'bad', 'sound', 'scene', 'be', 'multi-generational', 'source', 'stretches', 'inertia', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'go', ""daring.WH'OS"", 'KNOCKING', 'AT', 'MY', 'DOOR', 'merit', 'not', 'only', 'directorial', 'first', 'effort', 'acknowledged', 'master', 'germination', 'two', 'ideas', 'Scorsese', 'explored', 'more', 'fully', 'inMEAN', 'STREETS', '1973', 'GOODFELLAS', '1990', 'lesser', 'extent', 'RAGING', 'BULL', '1980', '1', 'male-bonding', 'always', 'precedence', 'man/woman', 'relationships', '2', 'are', 'two', 'distinct', 'categories', 'women', 'understood', 'men', 'properly', 'guilt-ridden', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'upbringing.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'J.R.', 'clearly', 'distinctions', 'here', 'sweetheart', 'are', 'girls', 'kind', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'innocent', 'pure', 'virginal', 'marriage', 'broads', 'are', 'men', 'room', 'doorknob', 'everybody', 'turn', 'labelled', 'Italian-American', 'guys', 'J.R.', 'hoo-urs', 'first', 'type', 'marry', 'enshrine', 'safely', 'home', 'second', 'freely', 'get', 'down', 'dirty', 'cheesy', 'motel', 'rooms', 'car', 'back', 'double', 'standard', 'would', 'have', 'immediate', 'repercussions', 'love', 'life.As', 'mentioned', 'WHO', 'THAT', 'KNOCKING', 'bifurcated', 'plotline', 'wolfpack', 'adventures', 'J.R.', 'pals', 'are', 'far', 'separated', 'private', 'romantic', 'life', 'latter', 'relationship', 'awry', 'when', 'Zina', 'Bethune', 'anonoymous', 'Girl', 'boyfriend', 'J.R.', 'hearing', 'girls', 'broads', 'philosophy', 'one', 'night', 'man', 'forced', 'thus', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'chaste', 'previously', 'affectionate', 'J.R.', 'who', 'great', 'effort', 'had', 'refrained', 'doing', 'Girl', 'marriage', 'instantly', 'bitter', 'hoo-ur', 'cruelly', 'away', 'friendship', 'equivalent', 'J.R.', 'interactions', 'guys', 'times', 'quarrel', 'name-call', 'wrassle', 'duke', 'out', 'always', 'remain', 'buddies', 'fun', 'just', 'hanging', 'around', 'getting', 'way', 'too', 'drunk', 'aimlessly', 'cruising', 'streets', 'climbing', 'forested', 'hill', 'small', 'rural', 'town', 'enjoying', 'view', 'summit.J.R', 'broods', 'while', 'ex-sweety', 'good', 'moments', 'especially', 'mean', 'treatment', 'last', 'time', 'were', 'together', 'eventually', 'knocking', '6:30', 'am', 'hour', 'happy', 'see', 'J.R.', 'One', 'element', 'story', 'seemed', 'plotless', 'resolved', 'last', 'scene']",N/A

They grapple with what becomes a favorite conflict of Scorsese's throughout the rest of his career. This is the Italian American male and his perception of women as one of two types, either a prostitute or a madonna with nothing in between. This film was made in the late '60s so this idea couldn't have been more alive and well in society. Keitel pulls off this extremely difficult, inherently unlikable role. Most of the action takes place between him and the woman or between him and his buddies, who are all like him. Some might consider this dated but I think within that subculture this is not an idea which is totally dead yet. However, it does not cut as wide a swathe through our society as it once did.

Ostensibly this film is about an Italian-American boy from New York torn between his loyalties to his buddies and religious convictions and his love for a college-educated girl.  When the film explores the dynamics of the relationship between Keitel and the girl(Zina Bethune) the film has me in it's grip only to be sidetracked soon after with pointless antics between Keitel and his friends.  The activities of Keitel and his friends aren't even interesting;their boring.  The actors who play Keitel's buddies are nondescript;they seem like cardboard cut-outs of Italian-American stereotypes.  The film attempts to explore the Keitel character's madonna-whore complex but that even comes off as half baked.  Ultimately, all of these elements undermine the central relationship between Keitel and Bethune leaving for an unsatisfying experience.  Even Scorsese's normally impeccable choices of pop songs don't work here;they seem to have been picked arbitrarily without commenting on the action we see on the screen.

I would only recommend this movie to Scorsese obsessives and in particular aficionados of Mean Streets. As Mean Streets is my favorite film, I felt it a duty to watch Knocking which has often been described as a dry run for Streets. Although it has many of the elements that would later blossom into the classic Scorsese style, it doesn't quite come together here. In fact, strip out the curiosity factor and Keitel's maverick performance and it's a thoroughly tedious and self-indulgent affair. But then everyone has to start somewhere and if for nothing else, at least Knocking made me wish I was an Italian living in Lower Manhattan circa 1960.I'd advise anyone reading this to proceed directly to Mean Streets, a film of kinetic energy, loud neon and operatic brashness that Knocking only hints at.",2,Amateurish early Scorsese offering that bores rather than thrills,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,961,"['something', 'made-in-my-garage', 'early', 'effort', 'Scorsese', 'accordingly', 'plenty', 'rough', 'edges', 'little', 'way', 'charm', 'transcendence', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Scorsese', 'obsessives', 'particular', 'aficionados', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'favorite', 'film', 'felt', 'duty', 'watch', 'Knocking', 'often', 'been', 'described', 'dry', 'run', 'Streets', 'many', 'elements', 'would', 'later', 'blossom', 'classic', 'Scorsese', 'style', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'together', 'here', 'fact', 'out', 'curiosity', 'factor', 'Keitel', 'maverick', 'performance', 'thoroughly', 'tedious', 'self-indulgent', 'affair', 'then', 'everyone', 'start', 'somewhere', 'nothing', 'else', 'least', 'Knocking', 'made', 'wish', 'was', 'Italian', 'living', 'Lower', 'Manhattan', 'circa', '1960.I', ""'d"", 'advise', 'anyone', 'reading', 'proceed', 'directly', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'film', 'kinetic', 'energy', 'loud', 'neon', 'operatic', 'brashness', 'Knocking', 'only', 'hints']",N/A
826319,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000286RPM,Phil S.,"[0, 0]","It's obvious that Scorsese was going places after this low-budget debut. Fans might note that Mean Streeets is omewhat of a remake of Who's That Knocking... as it does again feature Keitel as the street guy torn between two worlds - living wrong and living right can somehow be balanced in the young man's psyche. Much of the same imagery migrated to the '72 film.Some of the most captivating images ever caught on film are found in this poor man's epic - the lighting, editing, and cinematography will take you away. (Or take you back to Little Italy in the mid-1960s).I struggled with much of the approximate first half of the film - was ""The Girl"" a *real* girl? Or a real girl that J.R. could never approach because he sensed a certain worldliness...disturbing to his way of life? Was his time with her in his imagination, something to intermittently preoccupy him while he messed around with his neighborhood pals bent on extending childhood? (Perhaps about ten minutes overlong with the slice of life cavorting about). Yet, even with that slight confusion, I was still reminded of Portrait of Jennie with Joseph Cotten - did Jennifer Jones exist in reality...or in his dreams?Perhaps a better approach would have been to copy the romantic black and white classic from 1948 - note that Keitel's love has no name! She is ""The Girl"" - exquisitely played by Zina Bethune. Her dignified mysteriousness is quite mesmerizing. The perfect counterpoint to Harvey Keitel's roughness. He enthuses over John Wayne westerns; she loves to take ferry rides...just for the ride. A point of connection is in a beautiful early scene at the dock when J.R. gets her to admit she does have a fondness for westerns!Speaking of Keitel, in his film debut he displays his ability to draw the viewer in to his realm by understating, though - NYU Film Scool graduates, help me out - I wonder if this belies some real lack of artistic resourcefulness. Doesn't, however, take away from his stature as a compelling character actor in many good roles.Overall, a very good film.

Hemakes a distinction between the fun he has with those fastwomen, as compared with the serious relationship he desiredwith a girlfriend he's planning on spending his life with,originally drawing an impervious line between the two.The filming is wide-screen, black and white, with crystalclear  images;  the only bizarre moments being the lack ofaudio in some  scenes showing people talking, or the out ofplace audio as compared to what is visually shown, orsimply random noises in the background.A number of popular mainstream American numbers areselected, such as ""The Closer You Are"" doo-wop, and others,allowing youth to (again) better relate to the action ascompared to  movies from earlier generations.Keitel's talent is clear, as he visually expresses withsubtlety, feelings that are simmering below the surface,bringing a natural presence, or personality, to thepicture, more real to viewers.The director decided to film all  the actors wearing asports suit and tie, as a kind of standard uniform, forstylish reasons.The technology of the era is somewhat demonstrated, withmultiple floor automobile parking, air conditioning andelectric windows in vehicles, etc.A questionable decision, are the final moments of the work,which is the juxtaposition of pop music and sacredreligious objects, not long after Keitel's character isshown repenting and confessing his sins.This suggests the protagonist is set in his ways, and can'treform or correct his character, and suggests also perhaps,that's what every American is going through in this day andage (late 1960's.)The work is time well spent, as the editing is spotless,and Zina Bethune's soft-spoken, candid, realistic acting isa match for Harvey Keitel.",3,A film about those who don't follow the 9 to 5 company man routine,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,3296,"['Who', 'Knocking', 'My', 'Door', '1969', '2', 'punch', 'combination', 'being', 'Martin', 'Scorcesepicture', 'headlining', 'Harvey', 'Keitel.This', 'film', 'demonstrated', 'set', 'standard', 'world-classwork', 'individuals', 'would', 'continue', 'accomplishingtime', 'again', 'particular', 'movie', 'various', 'components', 'themain', 'one', 'being', 'attempt', 'bridge', 'gap', 'makinga', 'professional', 'movie', 'what', 'interesting', 'theaverage', 'man', 'street', 'early', 'mid', '20', 'who', 'finishedschool', 'college', 'who', 'present', ""n't"", 'following', 'theset', 'pattern', '9', '5', 'company', 'man', 'routine.As', 'such', 'large', 'part', '90', 'mins', 'Keitel', 'ZinaBethune', 'establishing', 'rapport', 'building', 'relationship', 'gaining', 'intimacy', 'finally', 'addressing', 'spiritual', 'coreissues', 'morality', 'terms', 'how', 'much', 'relationshipshould', 'would', 'need', 'evolve', 'grow', 'legitimately.In', 'reality', 'Keitel', '2', 'pals', 'struggle', 'find', 'meaningin', 'lives', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'nothaving', 'set', 'objective', 'overall', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'withit', 'preferring', 'instead', 'perpetuate', 'adolescent', 'frat-house', 'lifestyle', 'driving', 'car', 'hostingparties', 'hired', 'women', 'entertainment', 'drinking', 'gambling', 'playing', 'cards', 'when', 'not', 'managing', 'snack', 'barone', 'managing.At', 'same', 'time', 'Keitel', 'character', 'perplexed', 'inreconciling', 'libido', 'satisfies', 'anumber', 'hired', 'women', 'flat', 'throwing', 'cash', 'upper-class', 'mature', 'Italian', 'family', 'upbringing', 'orwith', 'Catholic', 'traditions', 'also', 'inculcated', 'early', 'Hemakes', 'distinction', 'fun', 'fastwomen', 'compared', 'serious', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'planning', 'spending', 'life', 'originally', 'drawing', 'impervious', 'line', 'two.The', 'filming', 'wide-screen', 'black', 'white', 'crystalclear', 'images', 'only', 'bizarre', 'moments', 'being', 'lack', 'ofaudio', 'scenes', 'showing', 'people', 'talking', 'out', 'ofplace', 'audio', 'compared', 'what', 'visually', 'shown', 'orsimply', 'random', 'noises', 'background.A', 'number', 'popular', 'mainstream', 'American', 'numbers', 'areselected', 'such', 'Closer', 'Are', 'doo-wop', 'others', 'allowing', 'youth', 'again', 'better', 'relate', 'action', 'ascompared', 'movies', 'earlier', 'generations.Keitel', 'talent', 'clear', 'visually', 'withsubtlety', 'feelings', 'are', 'simmering', 'surface', 'bringing', 'natural', 'presence', 'personality', 'thepicture', 'more', 'real', 'viewers.The', 'director', 'decided', 'film', 'actors', 'wearing', 'asports', 'suit', 'tie', 'kind', 'standard', 'uniform', 'forstylish', 'reasons.The', 'technology', 'era', 'somewhat', 'demonstrated', 'withmultiple', 'floor', 'automobile', 'parking', 'air', 'conditioning', 'andelectric', 'windows', 'vehicles', 'questionable', 'decision', 'are', 'final', 'moments', 'work', 'juxtaposition', 'pop', 'music', 'sacredreligious', 'objects', 'not', 'long', 'Keitel', 'character', 'isshown', 'repenting', 'confessing', 'sins.This', 'protagonist', 'set', 'ways', ""can'treform"", 'correct', 'character', 'also', 'perhaps', 'what', 'American', 'going', 'day', 'andage', 'late', '1960', 'work', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'editing', 'spotless', 'Zina', 'Bethune', 'soft-spoken', 'candid', 'realistic', 'acting', 'isa', 'match', 'Harvey', 'Keitel']",N/A

826322,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000286RPM,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Who's That Knocking At My Door is primarily of historical interest, more an exercise in style - in this case a New York 60s spin on nouvelle vague and Italian neo-realism - than a work of substance. Expanded from a film school project, Scorsese's feature debut is typically light on plot, counterpointing Harvey Keitel's Mean Streets-lite time-wasting with the boys from the old neighbourhood with his failed romance with Zina Bethune that offers the possibility something better. There's more energy than insight and the passage of time has dulled it's edge, but it's not without interest, especially in the way that at times Keitel seems to be playing Scorsese, never more so than in the scene where he picks up Bethune by talking about The Searchers after seeing a picture of the Duke in her copy of Cahiers du Cinema.Warners DVD includes a partial audio commentary from Martin Scorsese and an informative interview featurette with directorial assistant Mardik Martin, but it might have been interesting to have seen the original short film version, Bring On the Dancing Girls, as well.
