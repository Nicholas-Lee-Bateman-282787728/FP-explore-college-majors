Anderson,"[3, 3]","I have the original DVD release of PETE'S DRAGON and when the remastered DVD version came out I figured I will wait it out for the Blue Ray disc. Well I did, the print looks great only, what happened?  All of the DVD Bonus Features on the 2nd DVD release are almost all gone on this new Blue disc.  Here is the breakdown:2009 High Flying Edition (2nd DVD Release):BONUS FEATURES:Sneak Peeks: Snow White on Blu-ray, The Prince & The Frog (theatrical), Disney Blu-ray, Hannah Montana the Movie, Up, D23, Earth, and Tinkerbell: The Lost Treasure.Brazzle Dazzle Effects (25:23): Narrated by Sean Marshall (Pete)Deleted Storyboard Sequence: ""Terminus & Hoagy Hunt Elliott"" (2:25)--Nothing really missed here!Original Song Concept: ""Boo Bop BopBop Bop (I Love You Too)"" (2:35): Very pop-sounding; almost a little out of place. Not missed from the storyline, it featured both Pete & Elliot.Original Demo Recordings (all from February 11, 1976):Brazzle Dazzle Day: Alternate song, first attempt. The song was liked by re-written.Every Little Piece: Alternate melody. Thought to be too somber, the lyrics were kept, but the melody was rewritten.The Greatest Star of All: Deleted song for a deleted character. Artist Ken Anderson thought 2 villains were not needed, so both song and character were cut.Promotional Record:Pop versions of songs from the movie released on a 7"" Vista record are presented here: It's Not Easy, Brazzle Dazzle Day, There's Room For Everyone, Candle on the Water.Art Galleries: Concept Art, Behind-the-scenes, and publicity galleries. Varying quality, but still very cool to see, especially the behind-the-scenes shots.Trailers: International & Theatrical Trailers""About Pete's Dragon"": 5 screens with production notes about the movie.""Disney Family Album"" (excerpt, 2:20): About artist Ken Anderson. He describes how he based Elliot on Wallace Beery - large, bumbling, but loveable. He also is seen at the Disney ranch, which he describes as his Laughing Place.""The Plausible Impossible"" (excerpt, 3:36): From the Disneyland TV show, October 31, 1956. Shows the Disney Art of Animation book, with chapter 5 about the Plausible Impossible--using animation to make the unreal look real. Clips from Fantasia shown.""Lighthouse Keeping"" (1956, 6:45): Donald Duck cartoonIncludes a game for the very young, where you must find Elliott.The New 2013 35th Anniversary Blue Ray:BONUS FEATURES:Brazzle Dazzle Effects (25:23): Narrated by Sean Marshall (Pete)Deleted Storyboard Sequence: ""Terminus & Hoagy Hunt Elliott"" (2:25)--Nothing really missed here!Trailers: Theatrical TrailersSo what happened?!?! Well I went ahead and ordered the 2009 DVD to go with it (sure the new Blue Ray comes with a DVD as well, just not of the 2009 version with all of the extras. So, if extras are not your thing, the Blue Ray will do just fine, if you like them, grab the 2009 DVD as well to have it all.Thanks Disney, no I mean it...

289218,A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,6301991311,"Anthony G Pizza ""trivialtony""","[4, 18]","Pete had a long, draggin' tale, just not a sharp one.Its more than two hours (edits over its more than 30 year history have ranged from 94 to 131), run longer than most children's films including nearly all other Disney classics. Its cast (Mickey Rooney, Red Buttons, Charlie Callas, Shelley Winters) seemed suited more for Dean Martin celebrity roast than Disney film.  (Martin's connection isn't just casting; the first production number is set in a tavern and even the title character imbibes.)And despite a well-sung, Oscar-nominate score (especially by 70s popster Helen Reddy and by Broadway's Jim Dale as slimy Doc Terminus),Don Chaffey's film is dominated by a semi-invisible dragon, his mop top fop of a boy, and powerful adults either not getting them (Jane ""Trixie Norton "" Kean as a stern schoolteacher, pompous, underused Jim Backus as Passmaquody's mayor with egg on his face.) and/or wanting to and failing (Terminus, partner Hoagy portrayed by Buttons, Pete's adoptive, abusive family led by Ms. Winters and a young Jeff Conaway.)Maybe realizing this, Disney frames ""Pete's Dragon"" as part of its history bridging live action and animation (extending from Walt Disney's first experiments with the form in the 1920s through acknowledged classics like ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,"" to more recent, CGI-based efforts like ""Enchanted.""Its extras include a useful documentary narrated by title star Sean Marshall, which explains this technology and gives the film perspective and timeline. (This, plus Marshall's recalling his experience and castmates, make the documentary more useful and entertaining than the film.)Extras also include alternate songs (""Candle On The Water"" lost Oscar's 1977 best song to ""You Light Up My Life""), a vintage Donald Duck cartoon, a snippet of ABC-TV's ""Disneyland"" show and some of Don Bluth's deleted film storyboards.Overall, ""Pete's Dragon"" has the overblown feel of renowned classics like ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"" or stagebound 1970s Disney like ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" or ""Gus.""

Sure, it's a little corny at times and the special effects aren't as spectacular as they once were considered, but this film is one I've treasured.I hated ""Mary Poppins"" growing up, and I still hate it, so I'm happy my parents chose to invest in buying ""Pete's Dragon"" as opposed to ""Mary"".  I really don't understand why this film has been forgotten while that horrible nanny movie continues to perservere.  Ugh.  Sorry, enough with that rant.""Pete's Dragon"" is a story about an orphan boy and his invisible best friend, Elliot.  Who just happens to be a green and pink dragon.  Pete escapes an undesirable and cruel family to find a small fishing town in Maine.  He's soon taken in by the beautiful, single, lighthouse keeper named Norah and her cantankerous father.  Pete has a hard time fitting in around town, and telling everyone he has a pet dragon doesn't seem to help young Pete climb up the popularity ladder.  He discovers that Norah has a long-lost love who was lost at sea and she's been waiting for him ever since.  He loves living in the lighthouse and turns out to be a very helpful, if not somewhat unique boy.  However, Pete soon meets a con man who wants to sell Elliot's parts for his own profit!  Pete has to go on a daring rescue, but will he save his best friend in time?  Meanwhile, Pete's horrible old family tries to get him back and the con man's helping them!  Pete also has a daring mission to undertake when the lighthouse light goes out during a storm!This movie is vibrant and oddly, believable.  Despite what you may think, after a few minutes, you have no trouble believing in Elliot.  The music is gorgeous.  ""Candle on the Water"" is the most famous song, but ""It's A Razzle-Dazzle Day,"" ""There's Room For Everyone In This World,"" ""It's Not Easy,"" etc... are all wonderful tunes that you'll be humming for days.

289233,A8S11VP9Z36D6,6301991311,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[46, 50]","""Pete's Dragon"" (1977) has become a somewhat forgotten Disney movie that was originally inspired by the success ofMary Poppins (45th Anniversary Special Edition)as a live-action/animation musical. The story finally got the green-light in 1975; songs were by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn, and an all-star cast was assembled: singer Helen Reddy in her first film role, Broadway's Jim Dale, Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Jim Backus, and Mickey Rooney. Sean Marshall, in his first acting job, portrayed the title character of Pete.Pete is a young orphan who has escaped the abusive family that adopted him: a dirty bunch of hillbillies known as The Gogans (Jeff Conaway, Kenickie fromGrease (Rockin' Rydell Edition) [Blu-ray] plays one of The Gogans). They adopted Pete to use him as a slave. Elliot, a large green dragon who can become invisible at will, helps Pete escape, and acts as his friend and protector. Pete ends up in the small village of Passamaquoddy, where he is taken in by kindly Nora (Reddy) and her father Lampie (Rooney). The two own the lighthouse in town, where Nora waits for her boyfriend Paul to return, even though he was lost at sea years before. The Gogans find Pete and attempt to steal him back, with the aid of Doc Terminus (Dale), a medicine showman, and his shill, Hoagy (Buttons). Although fairly predictable, it is a heartwarming story with an excellent cast and music that is light and breezy. Definitely good fare for the young!Nominated for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (""Candle in the Water""), pleasantly sung by Reddy.When watching today, the animation looks a little antiquated, as digital animation and the ability to combine live-action with cartoons has obviously improved since 1977. Still, with the limitations of the day, what the Disney team was able to create is still quite impressive. The entire town of Passamaquoddy was built on the Disney backlot, with a functioning lighthouse built above Morro Bay, California. The US Coast Guard had to give permission to Disney to actually light it so as not to confuse real ships in the water. Disney's Golden Oak Ranch in Santa Clarita was also used for a number of outdoor shots.SPECS:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound * Widescreen (1.66:1)--Enhanced for 16x9 TVs. This was the first Disney film recorded in the Dolby Stereo sound system. The clarity and color of the image of the DVD are excellent; sound is good too, but nothing that will really blow your speakers away. Running time of approximately 129 minutes, which is just about 5 minutes short of the original roadshow version.BONUS FEATURES:Sneak Peeks: Snow White on Blu-ray, The Prince & The Frog (theatrical), Disney Blu-ray, Hannah Montana the Movie, Up, D23, Earth, and Tinkerbell: The Lost Treasure.Brazzle Dazzle Effects (25:23): Narrated by Sean Marshall (Pete) who is heard present day, but never seen! Sean takes us on a journey telling the history of live-action/animation in Disney films, beginning the Alice Comedies. Virginia Davis (Alice) recalls pantomiming to invisible animals. ""Children love to pretend. I loved to pretend, too."" Disney thought that by putting a live girl in an animated setting he could get a leg-up on the competition. Ub Iwerks joined the Disney team early, left, and then returned in the 1940's. Many of the special effect processes that have made Disney film magic possible were a result of his genius. ""The Three Caballeros"" was a milestone in 1945 in combining color live-action film with animation. Using rear-screen projection and special process-lab effects, Iwerks helped the film accomplish many things never seen before. The real jump came in 1959 with ""Ten Who Dared,"" a film that used the Sodium Vapor Process Screen. Using yellow lights/filters, filmmakers were able to block out backgrounds that made it easier to combine the animation. Without this process, ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Mary Poppins"" would never have been possible. Marshall recalls filming ""Pete's Dragon"" in the summer of 1976. He loved the entire process: special effects, acting, dancing, makeup. ""The only thing I didn't like was the fame!"" He recalls Red Buttons and Mickey Rooney attempting to upstage each other, and how choreographer Onna White's instruction helped prepare him to be a college pole-vaulter. In this featurette, you will see the original live-action film and learn how it was combined with the animation. Very interesting to watch documentary.Deleted Storyboard Sequence: ""Terminus & Hoagy Hunt Elliott"" (2:25)--Nothing really missed here!Original Song Concept: ""Boo Bop BopBop Bop (I Love You Too)"" (2:35): Very pop-sounding; almost a little out of place. Not missed from the storyline, it featured both Pete & Elliot.Original Demo Recordings (all from February 11, 1976):Brazzle Dazzle Day: Alternate song, first attempt. The song was liked by re-written.Every Little Piece: Alternate melody. Thought to be too somber, the lyrics were kept, but the melody was rewritten.The Greatest Star of All: Deleted song for a deleted character. Artist Ken Anderson thought 2 villains were not needed, so both song and character were cut.Promotional Record:Pop versions of songs from the movie released on a 7"" Vista record are presented here: It's Not Easy, Brazzle Dazzle Day, There's Room For Everyone, Candle on the Water.Art Galleries: Concept Art, Behind-the-scenes, and publicity galleries. Varying quality, but still very cool to see, especially the behind-the-scenes shots.Trailers: International & Theatrical Trailers""About Pete's Dragon"": 5 screens with production notes about the movie.""Disney Family Album"" (excerpt, 2:20): About artist Ken Anderson.

289238,A31A9GENAJYD64,6301991311,David M. Rossi,"[0, 0]","I can remember watching Pete's Dragon as a kid and thinking that it was a fun movie with a few too many songs. Fast forward a few years later, and I edited the film using a copy I recorded off tv and a second vcr. I took out half the songs and it stood very well without them. The pacing was much better.In my mind, after watching it on dvd last night, this is still the film's biggest drawback: it's over-long because of the songs. In other similarly formatted films like Disney's Bedknobs & Broomsticks and Mary Poppins, the music was used to propel the story along, it was a PART of the overall story. In Pete's Dragon the story has legs of it's own and doesn't need the tacked on songs to keep it moving, and so, as a result, the film's pacing is severely affected and it often feels like the story is dragging. Further, ALL of the songs are too long, going on for 3 and 4 verses, something that would be excessive even if the film's storyline DID need the songs.In one scene, baddie Dr. Terminus and his sidekick sing a song about all the nasty things they plan to do to Elliot the dragon once they catch him. It's one of the worst, completely unnecessary songs in the film and it goes on and on and when it's done and the baddies interact with Pete and Nora for a couple minutes, when the interaction is finished they start the song AGAIN! By this point it's just sheer torture, and it becomes necessary to hit the chapter button to skip to the next chapter.Helen Reddy, the singer of the feminist song 'I am Woman' was clearly selected only because of her sudden (at the time) popularity, leaving a hole in the film that could have been filled by any number of better choices of higher caliber actresses and singers. She puts in a decent enough performance, yet you can't help wondering what someone with the talent, charisma and magnetism of Angela Lansbury, Julie Andrews or Dick Van Dyke could have done. Reddy simply didn't have the 'history' of actors who starred in previous Disney outings with animation and live action. Mickey Rooney, however, is excellent as Lampy the often drunk lighthouse keeper and then newcomer Sean Marshall is enchanting and adorable as Pete. Shelly Winters as a Hollywood-style, stereotypically nasty foster mom to Pete, who treats him more as bought property than son is also good in the part, but she gets little more to do than sing some of the film's most forgettable and unnecessary songs.The story is lighthearted and typical Disney, and fans of films that juxtapose animation and live action on the same screen should definitely see the film for it's merits of how well put together those scenes in particular are believably constructed. On dvd, the magical sequences where Elliot vanishes or materializes are particularly great looking. The sparkling blue haze never looked so sharp on the big screen or in vhs versions of the film.For me, the attraction of Pete's Dragon has always been the idea of having a fun loving dragon as a personal guardian and playmate. That's a fantasy I'm sure plenty of boys (and some girls) even today would scramble to fulfill if it were possible.The over-arching themes of the importance of friendship and never giving up on finding what you need to make your life complete, in spite of adversity, still and always will resonate positively, and many scenes in the film will warm hearts no matter what the age.So, to sum it up, Pete's Dragon may go on too long due to songs, but it's worthy of your collection nonetheless for its' many strengths. Now, if only I could find a way to make a new shortened version of the dvd as I did years ago with my recorded-off-tv vhs copy....",3,Disney tried a bit too hard,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,3658,"['can', 'remember', 'watching', 'Pete', 'Dragon', 'kid', 'thinking', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'songs', 'Fast', 'forward', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'edited', 'film', 'using', 'copy', 'recorded', 'off', 'tv', 'second', 'vcr', 'took', 'out', 'songs', 'stood', 'very', 'well', 'pacing', 'was', 'much', 'mind', 'watching', 'dvd', 'last', 'night', 'still', 'film', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'over-long', 'songs', 'other', 'similarly', 'formatted', 'films', 'Disney', 'Bedknobs', 'Broomsticks', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'music', 'was', 'used', 'propel', 'story', 'was', 'PART', 'overall', 'story', 'Pete', 'Dragon', 'story', 'legs', 'own', ""n't"", 'need', 'tacked', 'songs', 'keep', 'moving', 'so', 'result', 'film', 'pacing', 'severely', 'affected', 'often', 'story', 'dragging', 'Further', 'ALL', 'songs', 'are', 'too', 'long', 'going', '3', '4', 'verses', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'excessive', 'even', 'film', 'storyline', 'DID', 'need', 'songs.In', 'one', 'scene', 'baddie', 'Dr.', 'Terminus', 'sidekick', 'sing', 'song', 'nasty', 'things', 'plan', 'do', 'Elliot', 'dragon', 'catch', 'one', 'worst', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'songs', 'film', 'when', 'done', 'baddies', 'interact', 'Pete', 'Nora', 'couple', 'minutes', 'when', 'interaction', 'finished', 'start', 'song', 'AGAIN', 'point', 'just', 'sheer', 'torture', 'necessary', 'hit', 'chapter', 'button', 'skip', 'next', 'chapter.Helen', 'Reddy', 'singer', 'feminist', 'song', 'am', 'Woman', 'was', 'clearly', 'selected', 'only', 'sudden', 'time', 'popularity', 'leaving', 'hole', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'number', 'better', 'choices', 'higher', 'caliber', 'actresses', 'singers', 'decent', 'enough', 'performance', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'what', 'someone', 'talent', 'charisma', 'magnetism', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Reddy', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', ""'history"", 'actors', 'who', 'starred', 'previous', 'Disney', 'outings', 'animation', 'live', 'action', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'however', 'excellent', 'Lampy', 'often', 'drunk', 'lighthouse', 'keeper', 'then', 'newcomer', 'Sean', 'Marshall', 'enchanting', 'adorable', 'Pete', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'Hollywood-style', 'stereotypically', 'nasty', 'foster', 'mom', 'Pete', 'who', 'more', 'bought', 'property', 'son', 'also', 'good', 'part', 'little', 'more', 'do', 'sing', 'film', 'most', 'forgettable', 'unnecessary', 'songs.The', 'story', 'lighthearted', 'typical', 'Disney', 'fans', 'films', 'juxtapose', 'animation', 'live', 'action', 'same', 'screen', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'film', 'merits', 'how', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'scenes', 'particular', 'are', 'believably', 'constructed', 'dvd', 'magical', 'sequences', 'where', 'Elliot', 'materializes', 'are', 'particularly', 'great', 'looking', 'sparkling', 'blue', 'haze', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'sharp', 'big', 'screen', 'vhs', 'versions', 'film.For', 'attraction', 'Pete', 'Dragon', 'always', 'been', 'idea', 'having', 'fun', 'loving', 'dragon', 'personal', 'guardian', 'playmate', 'fantasy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'plenty', 'boys', 'girls', 'even', 'today', 'would', 'scramble', 'fulfill', 'were', 'possible.The', 'over-arching', 'themes', 'importance', 'friendship', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'finding', 'what', 'need', 'make', 'life', 'complete', 'spite', 'adversity', 'still', 'always', 'will', 'resonate', 'positively', 'many', 'scenes', 'film', 'will', 'warm', 'hearts', 'matter', 'what', 'age.So', 'sum', 'up', 'Pete', 'Dragon', 'may', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'due', 'songs', 'worthy', 'collection', 'nonetheless', 'many', 'strengths', 'Now', 'only', 'could', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'new', 'shortened', 'version', 'dvd', 'did', 'years', 'recorded-off-tv', 'vhs', 'copy']",N/A

For grown-up movie fans, the film offers terrific cinematography, with wonderful scenes that take place near the coast &amp; the small town of Passamaquoaddy. The music is also very notable, it was nominated for an Oscar in 1977 as was the song &quot;Candle in The Water&quot;.The Gold Collection DVD edition, includes a great Donald Duck cartoon, &quot;Lighthouse Keeping&quot;, among other features.

He is pursued by a gaggle of nitwits who celebrate the art of child abuse with song and dance.  Apparently, they bought this boy and have a bill of sale to prove it.  Later, they sing about that too, celebrating slavery with catchy phrases, comparing the boy to a cow, as in property to be owned.  It's quite remarkable that no one took offense to this when it was released in 1977.This is not one of Disney's better efforts.  The story is sketchy at best; no attempt is made to give any of the characters a background.  They all seem to have popped up out of nowhere.  Everything feels very stagey.  The film is packed with production numbers galore, cute songs, an overabundance of villains (at one point the entire village conspires to kill poor Elliot the dragon)!  The overbearing tone throughout is one of nastiness, this film was definitely top heavy with creeps: the four Gogans, Dr. Terminus and his stooge, and a schoolteacher with a penchant for humiliation and corporal punishment!  For good measure, they tossed in a missing boyfriend with amnesia!  There's a lot of yelling, everyone is bombastic, you can count on one hand the number of ""nice"" people in this backward town.  The actors involved were either hams, has-beens, or those not destined for stardom.  But worst of all, the added element of an animated dragon is not very well integrated with the live action sequences.

Sean Marshall plays orphaned Pete who stumbles into a quaint village of Passamaquoddy. The real star of the film is Pete's (invisible) dragon friend named Elliot. During his stay in Passamaquoddy, Pete becomes friends with Nora (Helen Reddy) who runs a lighthouse and her father Lampie who is played by Mickey Rourke. Meanwhile hijinks ensues which leads the townsfolk to believe that Pete was behind the mayhem. Eventually the situation is straightened out.As a whole, PETE'S DRAGON is a suitable for young children.

After that I did not want to see another movie-musical, but then I accidently came across Pete's Dragon. Needless to say after I saw on TV I rented it and watched it at least 5 more times. The next time it was on TV I recorded. To this day I still love this movie. It is a humorous and interesting film. Here, no one believed that Pete had a dragon, but indeed the dragon was real. This is a great film for kids who are young and have a very vivid imagination. I remember I wanted to be a power ranger when I was younger. Children can relate their dreams and fantasies with Pete.For adults, this movie still holds up extremely well. It is pretty funny with an all star cast of Mickey Rooney and Red Buttons. Charlie Calice also performs the voice of Pete's Dragon. As far as I'm concerned, Calice provided no more sound effects than Chewbaca in Star Wars, just the occassional moan and groan here and there.Shelly Winters also plays a great role as one of the Gogans, who is trying to retain possession of Pete after he ran away. All she wants to do is use him for hard labor. However, Pete is taken in by a father and a daughter who own a lighthouse. They watch after Pete and later protect him from the Gogans.

I remember when I first watched this one(oh I was about 7) All I wanted to see Pete do was talk to the dragon and take rides on it's back.  However as I grew a little older and actually started to pay attention to the plot I wanted to see all the bad guys get what was coming to them(I was about 9 by this point).So ""Pete's Dragon"" is a good development movie it will keep the very young kids interested while teaching slightly older kids that there is such a thing as a plotParts of it are kind of dark so don't show this to extremely young kids of will scare them(or at the very least freak them out a little bit).  The only thing wrong with this movie is the fundamental flaw of most kids movies too young and the kids don't see the point, too old and the kids are bored by it.

289255,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,6301991311,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[3, 3]","PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A 2012 REVISION OF MY 2009 REVIEW, NOW ABOUT THE BLU-RAY EDITION, TOO:1977's Pete's Dragon was the last musical fantasy produced entirely within the Disney studio system. Two years later, The Black Hole would not perform well enough a the box office to sustain movies made within the studio and outside production companies were brought in, much in the way all of Hollywood did.The film is a time capsule of Walt Disney Productions in the '70's, with its distinctive house style. Even the sound quality is unique to the period.Familiar actors round out the cast, led by pop singer Helen Reddy, whose understated, matter-of-fact performance seems to play better today than it may have seemed to some in the past. Harry Potter and Broadway fans will enjoy the vitality and versatility of the great Jim Dale, who won a Tony as Barnum after this movie (a very similar role indeed) and narrated the American audio versions of the Potter books.Ambitious as Pete's Dragon was, it owed more to the wacky special effects comedies of its day than its two musical predecessors, Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Mary Poppins.It's closest relation to the other two films is the musical direction led by Oscar winner Irwin Kostal, who returned to Disney for Pete's Dragon and again to re-score a digital version of Fantasia and the short cartoon, The Small One. Like Mary Poppins, Pete's Dragon opens with on very a magical-sounding string section, rising before the title.Elliot the dragon took on a life of his own in the Disney Theme Parks as one of the favorite floats in the Main Street Electrical Parade. Surely there are those who think he originated in the parade and don't know the movie!But Pete's Dragon is one of those enjoyable Disney staples that every family should enjoy together. If you haven't got a copy yet, now is the time. And if you want to see it as sharply and colorfully as possible, you'll want the ""35th Anniversary Edition"" Blu-ray.The clarity may betray some of the period's special effects and matte shots, but you can see every speck of the once-grand Disney backlot and the lovely Golden Oak Ranch. The filmmakers really did a marvelous job at sustaining the feeling that this took place in a coastal Maine town, when in reality even the ocean was a trench of water augmented by matte paintings and inventive angles.Please note, though, that the previously released 2009 ""High Flying Edition"" of Pete's Dragon had several bonus features that are missing on this new release.2009 High Flying Edition Bonus Features:- Brazzle Dazzle Effects: Behind Disney's Movie Magic- Deleted Storyboard Sequence: Terminus & Hoagy Hunt Elliott- Original Song Concept: Bo Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)- Original Demo Recordings: ""Brazzle Dazzle Day"" (alternatesong); ""Every Little Piece"" (alternate melody); ""The GreatestStar of All"" (deleted song for deleted character) - PromotionalRecord (Pop versions of the songs from a 7"" record: It's NotEasy, Brazzle Dazzle Day, There's Room for Everyone,Candle on the Water- Where's Elliott? Disappearing Dragon Game- Pete's Dragon Art Galleries (Concept Art, Behind the Sccnes,Publicity)- Trailers- About Pete's Dragon (text)- Disney Family Album excerpt: Ken Anderson- The Plausible Impossible excerpt (dragons, dinosaurs,mythology)- Donald Duck cartoon: Lighthouse Keeping2010 ""35th Anniversary Edition"" DVD Bonus Features (both Blu-ray & DVD):- Brazzle Dazzle Effects: Behind Disney's Movie Magic- Deleted Storyboard Sequence: Terminus & Hoagy Hunt Elliott- Original Song Concept: Bo Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)- TrailersA few more notes from my 2009 review of the ""High Flying Edition"":""Brazzle Dazzle Effects: Behind Disney's Movie Magic""  makes it easier to understand that sodium screen process so often used in Disney films of the period -- a kind of yellow light behind the subject that somehow vanishes and allows two images to be combined. Maybe that yellow sheen is the reason that you could always spot a seam along the two separate images -- a problem solved by today's digital technology.I'm keeping both versions, especially because of those musical extras. There are a selection of demo recordings and a handful of Kids of the Kingdom-style ""pop versions"" of the songs I had not heard before. ""Brazzle Dazzle Day"" had a different melody with mostly different lyrics. ""Every Little Piece"" had the same lyrics with an ""If I Were a Rich Man""-like melody.  ""it's Not Easy"" had alternate lyrics that transformed it into a romantic love song. And there's even a deleted song called ""The Greatest Star of All,"" clearly intended for Jim Dale's character, Terminus. These alone make the new DVD worth getting.One feature that only appeared on the 2001 ""Gold"" DVD edition is the 25-minute 1973 live-action/animated documentary Man, Monsters and Mysteries, narrated by Sebastian Cabot with Sterling Holloway voicing the Loch Ness Monster (aka ""Nessie"").",4,"Blu ray looks fantastic, but bonus features are fewer than those on the 2009 edition",1250553600,"08 18,

WE RANK IT #3 of 41 disney movies.I bought my first VCR in 1980 and this was the first movie I actually bought, rather than just renting and duping. They reworked it some, placing ""Candle on the Water"" within the movie, rather than with the opening credits and I bought it again about 4 years ago. I am delighted to see this on DVD.We have always liked this movie over the bigger budget Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks.We own all 3 and the kids themselves have elected to watch Feakys Fraggen, because my son Steve also called it that, many dozens of times. Why. We love the music. We like the characters. And we like the animated dragon, even though they could have painted him better than they did. We know 4 of the songs and sing them regularly. We do fast forward through one section, but otherwise this is simply one of our favorite movies period.The cast is almost perfect. Helen Reddy, Jim Dale, who is the reader on the Harry Potter audio books, Mickey Rooney, Shelley Winters. Jim Backus, Red Buttons, Charlie Callas, Jeff Conaway as Willie Gogan who played Bobby in Taxi and also a security officer on Babylon 5. The lead actor Sean Marshall is the weak link and I don't think he ever made another movie.My 5 children range in age from 6 to 27 and this might be the most watched family oriented movie I have ever owned.We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Peter Pan is no Codfish, we rank it #2. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly.

For one, Disney can go beyond two hours of a movie, and still keep it G-rated. Now that's pretty impressive to me. Most companies would probably have rated it PG, but not Disney. They try and it keep for the whole auidience. Which is what everyone needs to see in a film. And the special effects isn't bad either.This film also includes the legendary Mickey Rooney. The story of Pete's Drangon is pretty simple. Pete is a young orphan, who is running away from his abopted parents, and end up in Maine, a fishing town with his best friend, Elliott. Sometimes you can see him, and other times, you can't. A kind lighthouse keeper, Nora played by (Helen Rebby), and her father (Mickey Rooney), Elliott's pranks gets them into a whole lot of trouble.The music in this film is Ocar-nominated beautiful. Like ""The Happist Home in These Hills,"" ""It's Not Easy,"" ""Candle on the Water,"" & ""Brazzle Dazzle Day.""

Pete's Dragon is one of the first Disney films to use live action and animation together in a film.  The story follows a boy who is on the run from his terrible adoptive family the Gogans (Shelley Winters, Rob Conaway)and his friend Elliot the dragon (voiced by Charlie Callas) who is sometimes invisible.  Together, they are the best of friends until they come upon a quaint fishing town where they soon start to get into mischief.Eventually Pete is taken in by Nora(Helen Reddy) a lighthouse keeper and her father(Mickey Rooney) where he soon becomes part of the family.  But soon, the Gogans discover where he is living and are determined to get him back.  There are many delightful performances in this film including Jim Dale who plays the terrible Dr. Terminus and his obnoxious side-kick Hoagie(played by red Buttons).  The funny thing about this movie is that Mickey Rooney and Red Buttons are drunk through most of it.  Lastly, I recommend this movie because of the music.  This film has some of the best Disney songs.  Most notably Helen Reddy's ""Candle on the Water"" and ""There's Room For Everyone"".

289275,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,6301991311,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[8, 8]","""Pete's Dragon"" is a solid family film that's full of music, fun, and adventure.  It stars Sean Marshall as Pete, a lonely orphan who's managed to escape from the hands of the evil Gogan family who legally ""bought"" him from the orphanage.  A friendly and sometimes invisible dragon named Elliott helps him escape, and they end up in the coastal town of Passamaquoddy, Maine.  Unfortunately for Pete, Elliott gets them into a lot of trouble with the locals.  They hide out in a cave until a friendly lighthouse keeper (Helen Reddy) finds them and takes Pete in to live with her and her father (Mickey Rooney).  No one believes that Elliott really exists (except for Nora's dad) until Elliott trashes the town school.  A travelling ""doctor,"" Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale), and his partner in crime, Hoagie (Red Buttons), cook up a scheme to capture Elliott and use him for profit.  Oh, and the Gogan family is still looking for Pete as well.  To top it all off, Nora longs for a lost love whom Pete claims that Elliott will find.  It's all played out lighthearted and sort of silly, scattered with music and horseplay throughout.The cast is very strong.  Including all of the above mentioned legends and newcomer Marshall, the cast also includes Shelley Winters as the Gogan matriarch, Jim Backus (""Gilligan's Island""), and Jeff Conaway (""Grease"" and ""Babylon 5"").  The music is very good, although it isn't on the same level as songs featured in other Disney classics.  For the 1970's, the blending of animation and live action is pretty good.The DVD itself is okay.  The digital transfer is good although a few shortcomings can be seen in the film.  The audio is good except in a couple of the songs, where it gets louder and quieter at brief times.  Special features include a fun featurette called ""Man, Monsters, and Mysteries"" which highlights a still-standing theory on the Loch Ness Monster.  There's a modest ""Where's Elliott?"" game, a Disney Family Album excerpt, preview trailers, and a funny short featuring Donald Duck called ""Lighthouse Keeping.""If you're a big fan or collector of Disney, this film is a nice purchase.  If you only want films that the whole family can watch, you might want to preview this disc before buying it.  The film may get a little boring for youngsters since the dragon isn't always on screen and their are long segments of nothing but live action and story development that might lose their interest.  Also, the run time clocks in at just over two hours.  That's not good if you have an impatient tot running around.  My six year-old enjoyed it, but she loves musicals to begin with.  Overall, ""Pete's Dragon"" is a decent family musical film for families with children five and up.

I have a VHS copy, but I watched it so much as a kid that it has not worked correctly for quite some time. So I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon recently. I ordered it right away and finally watched it last night!Now as an adult, the movie is absolutely adorable! I even found myself still getting emotional near the end. There are many funny moments especially between Lampie (Mickey Rooney) and Hoagie (Red Buttons). As in most Disney musicals, the musical numbers were very entertaining. It's amazing how much of a film you forget when you haven't seen it for a while. For example, I had forgotten how evil the Gogans, the family who ""adopted"" Pete, actually were. If you listen to the words in the two songs they perform, nowadays it would not be accepted, lol.Compared to now, of course the special effects & animation is not as high-tech, but I'm from the old school where I preferred the hand drawn animation where it took someone with immense artistic talent a lot of time to draw as well as paint a character in order to bring it to life. Having a computer degree was not a requirement. The special features were pretty good. There was a short featurette about how they made the movie.

289287,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,6301991311,Mark Baker,"[12, 13]","Pete (Sean Marshall) is a poor orphan.  He's been adopted by the mean Gogan family run by the matriarch Lena (Shelley Winters).  The Gogans make him work from morning til night and beat him for the slightest thing.So, naturally, he runs away.  Only this time he has help in the form of Elliot.  Elliot is a dragon.  And while he doesn't always think about what he's doing, he means well.  And he really wants to help Pete.Pete and Elliot happen to find the town of Passamaquoddy on the coast of Maine.  Their first trip through town doesn't go well, so they find themselves out by the lighthouse, where they make friends with Lampie (Mickey Rooney) the lighthouse keeper and his adult daughter Nora (Helen Reddy).  Have they found a real home at last?Meanwhile, Doc Terminus (Jim Dale) and his assistant Hoagy (Red Buttons) have wandered into town.  The Doc is a quack, selling fake potions and running from one town to the next just ahead of the lynch mob.  They get word of the dragon and set out to capture him for the money they can make from his body parts.  Will they get their hands on Elliot?This was a favorite movie as a kid, and I still find it entertaining as an adult.  Which is surprising when you consider the serious subject matter dealt with.  Lampie is an alcoholic and Pete is running away from an abusive home.  I think one reason it works is that the villains are so over the top you can't take them too seriously.  There's some classic vaudeville in them.  Heck, I often feel like booing the bad Doc.And the music really helps.  Yes, this is a musical with 10 songs.  Honestly, I love all these songs in their own way.  Of course, ""Candle on the Water"" is the most famous.  I think my favorite is ""Brazzle Dazzle Day.""Elliot is an animated dragon inhabiting a live action world.  While by no means state of the art for today, it does hold up remarkable well for a 30 year old film.All told, this really is a fun movie that kids of all ages will enjoy.

Each are connected vaguely by the fact that they're Disney live action musicals that incorporate pertial animation at some point in the story. In the case of Pete's Dragon, as opposed to the other two where the animation is confined to one sequence, the animation is limited to one character who (literally) pops up during the film's entire running time.Elliot, the title character, is a wonderful creation from a Disney who, at that time, were very troubled especially in animation. His intergration with the real world may not be Jurassic Park but it doesn't take long to accept his existance. That he spends a lot of his screen time invisible is actually a nice plot point instead of a lazy way to get of animating him much. The special effects involving the invisible Elliot are as impressive as the visible one.The film itself can easily accused of being twee and cliched. The fishing village in which the action takes place is one you would only ever find in a movie and the plot is a little predictable and plodding in places. Thank goodness then for the larger than life characters that inhabit this town! Standout by a mile is Jim Dale as Doc. Terminus, a flim-flamming quack with a bottle of coloured water to cure every ill. Red Buttons as his side-kick Hoagy is a great support and their scenes (and songs)are by far the most entertaining. Shelley Winters as Ma Gogan, Pete's 'legal' guardian, is also a barn-storming performance. With the rest of the Gogan clan they represent the kind of foul-smelling comic villain that Disney does so well. Helen Reddy and Micky Rooney are lumbered with the 'good guy' roles, Reddy's acting leaves a lot to be desired and Rooney could have been used more (his one good number I Swear I Saw a Dragon is a belter but then he seems to be almost forgotten).The score is uneven with the good songs include Every Little Piece (Dale and Buttons), Bill of Sale (Shelley et al.) and Candle in the Water (Reddy). Then you have trite tosh like Brazzle Dazzle Day. The choreography by Onna White (The Music Man) is almost non-existant - a real shame.A minor gripe would be that the animators can't quite seem to decide on Eliott's exact size. One minute he's towering over Pete and the next he's barely 9 feet tall. This is knit-picking though - on the whole this a great family move with something for everyone. It was one of my favourites growing up and, once you've seen Poppins and Bedknobs, is definately worth a look.",3,A Family Favourite,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,2649,"['Mary', 'Poppins', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'Bedknobs', 'Broomsticks', 'four', 'star', 'film', 'then', 'film', 'third', 'sort-of', 'trilogy', 'three', 'star', 'film', 'are', 'connected', 'vaguely', 'fact', ""'re"", 'Disney', 'live', 'action', 'musicals', 'incorporate', 'pertial', 'animation', 'point', 'story', 'case', 'Pete', 'Dragon', 'opposed', 'other', 'two', 'where', 'animation', 'confined', 'one', 'sequence', 'animation', 'limited', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'literally', 'up', 'film', 'entire', 'running', 'time.Elliot', 'title', 'character', 'wonderful', 'creation', 'Disney', 'who', 'time', 'were', 'very', 'troubled', 'especially', 'animation', 'intergration', 'real', 'world', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Jurassic', 'Park', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'accept', 'existance', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'invisible', 'actually', 'nice', 'plot', 'point', 'instead', 'lazy', 'way', 'get', 'animating', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'involving', 'invisible', 'Elliot', 'are', 'as', 'impressive', 'visible', 'one.The', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'accused', 'being', 'twee', 'cliched', 'fishing', 'village', 'action', 'place', 'one', 'would', 'only', 'ever', 'find', 'movie', 'plot', 'little', 'predictable', 'plodding', 'places', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'then', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'town', 'Standout', 'mile', 'Jim', 'Dale', 'Doc', 'Terminus', 'flim-flamming', 'quack', 'bottle', 'coloured', 'water', 'cure', 'ill.', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'side-kick', 'Hoagy', 'great', 'support', 'scenes', 'songs', 'are', 'far', 'most', 'entertaining', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'Ma', 'Gogan', 'Pete', ""'legal"", 'guardian', 'also', 'barn-storming', 'performance', 'rest', 'Gogan', 'clan', 'represent', 'kind', 'foul-smelling', 'comic', 'villain', 'Disney', 'so', 'well', 'Helen', 'Reddy', 'Micky', 'Rooney', 'are', 'lumbered', ""'good"", 'guy', 'roles', 'Reddy', 'acting', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Rooney', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'more', 'one', 'good', 'number', 'Swear', 'Saw', 'Dragon', 'belter', 'then', 'be', 'almost', 'forgotten', '.The', 'score', 'uneven', 'good', 'songs', 'include', 'Every', 'Little', 'Piece', 'Dale', 'Buttons', 'Bill', 'Sale', 'Shelley', 'et', 'al', 'Candle', 'Water', 'Reddy', 'Then', 'have', 'trite', 'tosh', 'Brazzle', 'Dazzle', 'Day', 'choreography', 'Onna', 'White', 'Music', 'Man', 'almost', 'non-existant', 'real', 'shame.A', 'minor', 'gripe', 'would', 'be', 'animators', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'decide', 'Eliott', 'exact', 'size', 'One', 'minute', 'towering', 'Pete', 'next', 'barely', '9', 'feet', 'tall', 'knit-picking', 'whole', 'great', 'family', 'move', 'something', 'everyone', 'was', 'one', 'favourites', 'growing', 'up', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Poppins', 'Bedknobs', 'definately', 'worth', 'look']",N/A

Disney, once untouchable in this respect, found itself in a bit of a quandry, the likes of which the theatrical release of ""Pete's Dragon"" didn't help.  Most critics found it hammy and, with the exception of Elliott, the dragon, discarded the movie as just a trite piece of fluff.  Well, it was and it is - but why does anything so light-hearted, gay and original have to be anything but?  In the intervening decades ""Pete's Dragon has gone on to become a much loved Disney classic and for good reasons.  Helen Reddy, Mickey Rooney, Red Buttons and Jim Dale are inspired casting choices, giving a depth to their characters that greatly enhances the film.  True, the film's score doesn't match the staying power of Mary Poppins but 'Candle on the Water' is a great romantic ballad, 'Brazzle Dazzle Day' is a fun-loving feel good song and 'Passamaquadi' is ultra camp played in the best sense.  Not much to complain about with Disney's transfer of the film.  It's anamorphic, near pristine and remixed to 5.1 stereo.  One note - 'Candle On The Water', for some inexplicable reason, may suddenly freeze frame in the middle of the song on some players the first run through.  If you are worried about this, play the song first to see if it does this and if so, simply still frame advance to the next track, then go back and replay the song.

Though it pales in comparison to Disney's last musical effort, &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks,&quot; it scores points with an entertaining song score (anchored by the Oscar-nominated &quot;Candle on the Water&quot;) and some delightful voice work by Charlie Callas as the voice of Elliott the Dragon. Mickey Rooney, Red Buttons, Jim Dale, Helen Reddy (in all fairness to negative reviews about her performance, the role of Nora is pretty lightweight to begin with) and Shelley Winters make an endearing ensemble. Of course, it is Elliott who is the film's greatest delight.This DVD has excellent picture and sound quality. The colors are sharp and grain is minimal (save for the process shots that mix the animated dragon with the live-action scenes), and the sound is pretty clear. The supplements include a re-issue trailer from 1984, pieces with background information on the myth of dragons and other such creatures, and more.

289317,A16QODENBJVUI1,6301991311,Robert Moore,"[2, 4]","By any measure PETE'S DRAGON is one of the weakest films ever made by Disney studios.  The period of time between the death of Walt Disney in 1966 and the release of THE LITTLE MERMAID in 1989 were pretty much the dark ages for Disney Studios.  What success they had in those years came pretty exclusively from live action films like THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN, HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS, THE FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR, and NEVER CRY WOLF.  This film is more live action than animation, which would be a good thing given how poor the animation is, but isn't because it simply isn't done very well.  Disney Studios has done an extraordinary number of great animated and live action movies over the decades, but they can't all be winners.  Earlier this year Disney released at about the same time two must-own discs:  PINOCCHIO and BOLT.  This simply isn't up to the standards of those two great films, the first of which comes from period of Disney's life and the second in the period of rebirth of the studios.  The heart of the problem is the script:  the film simply doesn't tell a very interesting story.  The special features, which are actually quite good, are much, much more entertaining than the film itself.There are some good things about this release.  One that I hope is a portend of things to come is the new ""fast play"" feature.  Perhaps the single most irritating feature of Disney DVDs has been how hard it is to skip the previews of coming attractions.  This isn't so bad the first time you put the DVD in, but it gets rather tedious after that.  But with the fast play feature you can skip the previews and go straight to the play menu.  I have to admit to a Pavlovian reaction to putting Disney DVDs into my player.  I instantly expect irritation in trying to skip everything and get straight to the movie.  So, I love this new option of skipping the previews.  Thank you Disney Studios!  I'm giving the disc an extra star for adding this feature.The one great delight for me in this film was seeing Jim Dale in the role of Dr. Terminus.  Most people will know Dale in either of two ways.  He did an absolutely magnificent reading of the Harry Potter books on CD.  More recently he wonderfully enhanced the TV series PUSHING DAISIES with his work as The Narrator.  I know that he was in the CARRY ON series of films, but I haven't seen any of those in ages and I don't remember him on those.  On the Harry Potter books he provided over two hundred voices for characters and turned the reading of a book into an art form.  He and Red Buttons provide some of the better moments in the film, including two of the bigger production musical numbers (which were hurt, as were all the musical numbers, by the weakness in the score).The rest of the cast, featuring a number of name actors, does not represent their best work.  I've never been a fan of Mickey Rooney, with even his best work of the thirties leaving me cold (I've always found him to be too animated and his acting too broad.  Shelly Winters at her best was a magnificent actress, but she often, especially late in her career, was not at her best.  The great upside here is that she is not on screen all that much.I found it sad watching these people demeaning themselves playing absurd hillbillies.  Elliot is voice by rubber-faced comedian (and, as my big-band loving father always points out to me, former Tommy Dorsey drummer) Charlie Callas.  Helen Reddy, who was famous at the time for a long string of best selling hit records (including the seventies feminist anthem ""I Am Woman""), has the ostensible lead, but frankly isn't very memorable.  Jeff Conaway has a small role and is almost unrecognizable as one of the hillbillies.The animation bits, while not very good, were directed by Don Bluth, who would go on to direct a number of extremely fine animated movies, including THE LAND BEFORE TIME, THE SECRET OF NIMH, and AN AMERICAN TAIL.  This obviously wasn't his best work.I need to add how offensive I found the depiction of hill folk in the film.  Everyone, everywhere belongs to some ethnic group.  My ancestors are dominated by Scots-Irish who stemmed from Appalachia and the Arkansas Ozarks.  There you see people who are impoverished but nothing like the appalling caricatures that you see in the film.  I've never seen anyone wallowing in filth like these people.  I also couldn't quite make geographical sense of the movie.  The hill people would seem to suggest someplace inland, while the coastal town felt more like New England than anything.My recommendation is to make sure you get either PINOCCHIO or BOLT (especially in the joint DVD/Blu-ray joint editions) instead of this.  These DVDs don't stay in circulation for very long and both of those are great versions of great movies.

289318,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6301991311,Robert Morris,"[0, 1]","As indicated previously in reviews of other films that are suitable for young children, notably the animated features produced by Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorks,  I have ten grandchildren and welcome opportunities to watch films with them. They range in age from three to 18. I had not seen Pete's Dragon previously (it was first released in 1977) and only recently watched it for the first time in its re-released  ""High-Flying Edition."" Set in New England early in the 20th century, the plot focuses on an orphan boy named Pete (Sean Marshall) and his guardian raptor, a pink and green dragon named Elliott (with Charlie Callas providing his voice). Pete is adopted by the Gogan family who serve as villains who pursue Pete and Elliott after they escape, finally arriving at Passamaquoddy, a harbor village on the coast of Maine. They are befriended by a young woman named Nora  (Helen Reddy) who lives with her father Lampie (Mickey Rooney) and is responsible for the lighthouse. The situation soon becomes complicated for reasons best revealed in the film, and then even more complicated with the arrival of Dr. Terminus....The ""Bonus Features"" are excellent. In fact, I suspect that some younger viewers will enjoy them more than the film. They include items identified as  ""Brazzle Dazzle Effects,"" ""Deleted Storyboard Sequence,"" ""Original Song Concept,"" ""Original Demo Recordings,"" ""Promotional Record of 4 `Pop' Versions of the Songs,"" and ""MUCH MORE!"" I would rate these features Five Stars in terms of their entertainment value but rating the film itself against Disney's admittedly high standards for quality, no more than Three Stars.

It took me awhile to warm up to this musical (what, 30 years??), and I don't mind saying I was still a skeptic. Finally I layed on my couch and gave it my full attention with no distractions, and even backtracked a little when I had to take a quick ""break."" I was determined to watch every frame. Bottom line, you know it's a heartwarming, YES, loveable film when the ending credits roll, and you hate to leave this place. That ending pan shot from the sky, as if riding away with Elliot made me think, I am going to miss the inside of that lighthouse. Fortunitely, I can see it again with the dvd.Helen Reddy's ""Candle On The Water"" was nominated for best song, and it's a lovely ballad about someone who has lost a great love, and unfortunitely, is somehow waiting for his return, even in the wake of hoplessness. She sings it on the rim on top of the lighthouse at night. You know, I thought this flick was going to be another Popeye musical, which is a movie you either liked or absolutely hated. I sort of like it, but I could see why Popeye was crucified during it's day. This movie almost ventures in that direction, but manages to keep afloat in the high tide of entertainment. If you really follow the story, and relish in some of the goofiness, this movie will become heartfelt.By the way, the two hammy villains remind me of Honest John and his pal Gideon of Pinocchio, and Shelly Winters looks like she's having a wonderful time playing that filthy hillbilly role of hers.

After a few days of causing mischief around town, Pete finds shelter in the warm and loving lighthouse of Nora and his father Lampie.  Nora, unlike her father, naturally does not believe in the existance of Elliott the dragon, but still allows Pete to let his imagination go wild.  Pete soon learns about Paul, Nora's fiance who sailed off into the sea and was never seen again; Pete promises Nora that Elliott can bring him back and for the sake of Pete's happiness, Nora accepts this promise.Nora, Lampie, Pete and even Elliott are happy and confortable in their new home, promising each other to keep together forever, unfortunately, before this can be, they'll have to fight against the wicked Doc Terminus and his companion Hoagy, a pair of villains who've discovered the existance of Elliott the dragon and now want to get him to make a profit from his goods.  To make matters worse, Doc Terminus counts with the help of the Gogans, who arrive in town just in time to re-claim what rightfully belongs to them.Although Pete's Dragon has an outstanding story line and one of the most touching ones Disney has ever produced, its strengh is really in the musical numbers.  The film features about 10 different songs, all of which are great, some of the best in my opinion include the Academy Award nominated ""Candle on the Water"", ""There's Room for Everyone"" (A very inspiring and beautiful song) and ""Brazzle Dazzle Day"" (Very uplifting and cheery).While the acting may not always be there, the film features great actors and actresses, Jim Dale as Doc Terminus, Shelley Winters as the evil (Yet hilarious!) Lena Gogan, Mickey Rooney as Lampie and Jane Kean as the hilariously wicked school teacher Miss Taylor.  Pete's Dragon is certainly a '70s Disney jewel to behold that will be enjoyed by children and those adults who like the good old Disney films of Yesterdayear.This Gold Collection DVD features decent picture and sound quality but lacks in the ammount of bonus features.

289343,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,6301991311,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","""Pete's Dragon,"" not among the Disney classics, is nonetheless a charming fantasy with all the elements to make it a favorite with young viewers:  comedy, an outsize, goofy monster, music, and a kid as the central character.  This partly animated, partly live-action 1977 film is a variation on the boy-and-his-dog film.  Instead of a high-IQ Lassie or heart-wrenching Old Yeller, Elliot, a twelve-foot animated dragon with the capacity to make himself invisible, stars as the companion for Pete (Sean Marshall), who looks to Elliot as refuge from his abusive adoptive family in the seaside town of Passamaquoddy, Maine.  After Elliot causes havoc with the local residents and Pete is blamed, Nora (Helen Reddy) sympathizes with the boy's dilemma and takes him to live with her and her father, Lampie (Mickey Rooney) -- no stranger to the bottle -- in the town's lighthouse.The movie follows a formula Disney established in the 1970's, before ""The Little Mermaid"" ushered in a latter-day era of animated classics.  Viewed today, it often seems quaint, with veteran Mickey Rooney mugging away and good and not-so-good motives spelled out in clear blacks and whites.  There's little subtlety, but the blend of animation and live action, a technique mastered exquisitely by Disney in ""Mary Poppins,"" is fun.Ms. Reddy, with fourteen U.S. Top 40 singles between 1971 and 1978 including the women's movement anthem, ""I Am Woman,"" was at the peak of her career when she starred in ""Pete's Dragon.""  She has an easy charm and a likable personality and comes off warm and motherly, exactly what the role of Nora calls for.  Her version of ""Candle on the Water"" was nominated for a Best Song Academy Award. The other songs by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn are appropriately bouncy.The supporting cast includes Jim Dale, Red Buttons, Shelley Winters, and Jim Backus.  Charlie Callas is the voice of Elliot.  DVD Bonus extras include a storyboard sequence deleted from the final film; a feature on the history of Disney's mix of live action and animation; demo song recordings; and the promotional recording of four pop versions of those songs.",4,Neat Combination of Live Action & Animation,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,2131,"['Pete', 'Dragon', 'not', 'Disney', 'classics', 'nonetheless', 'charming', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'make', 'favorite', 'young', 'viewers', 'comedy', 'outsize', 'goofy', 'monster', 'music', 'kid', 'central', 'character', 'partly', 'animated', 'partly', 'live-action', '1977', 'film', 'variation', 'boy-and-his-dog', 'film', 'Instead', 'high-IQ', 'Lassie', 'heart-wrenching', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'Elliot', 'twelve-foot', 'animated', 'dragon', 'capacity', 'make', 'invisible', 'stars', 'companion', 'Pete', 'Sean', 'Marshall', 'who', 'Elliot', 'refuge', 'abusive', 'adoptive', 'family', 'seaside', 'town', 'Passamaquoddy', 'Maine', 'Elliot', 'havoc', 'local', 'residents', 'Pete', 'blamed', 'Nora', 'Helen', 'Reddy', 'boy', 'dilemma', 'live', 'father', 'Lampie', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'stranger', 'bottle', 'town', 'lighthouse.The', 'movie', 'formula', 'Disney', 'established', '1970', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'ushered', 'latter-day', 'era', 'animated', 'classics', 'Viewed', 'today', 'often', 'quaint', 'veteran', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'mugging', 'away', 'good', 'not-so-good', 'motives', 'spelled', 'out', 'clear', 'blacks', 'whites', 'little', 'subtlety', 'blend', 'animation', 'live', 'action', 'technique', 'mastered', 'exquisitely', 'Disney', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'fun.Ms', 'Reddy', 'fourteen', 'U.S.', 'Top', '40', 'singles', '1971', '1978', 'including', 'women', 'movement', 'anthem', 'Am', 'Woman', 'was', 'peak', 'career', 'when', 'starred', 'Pete', 'Dragon', 'easy', 'charm', 'likable', 'personality', 'off', 'warm', 'motherly', 'exactly', 'what', 'role', 'Nora', 'version', 'Candle', 'Water', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Song', 'Academy', 'Award', 'other', 'songs', 'Al', 'Kasha', 'Joel', 'Hirschhorn', 'are', 'appropriately', 'bouncy.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jim', 'Dale', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Charlie', 'Callas', 'voice', 'Elliot', 'DVD', 'Bonus', 'extras', 'include', 'storyboard', 'sequence', 'deleted', 'final', 'film', 'feature', 'history', 'Disney', 'mix', 'live', 'action', 'animation', 'demo', 'song', 'recordings', 'promotional', 'recording', 'four', 'pop', 'versions', 'songs']",N/A

289346,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6301991311,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","When I was in college, a good friend of mine had me and several other friends watch his favorite movie of all time, PETE'S DRAGON.  That was the first time I had ever seen the movie and I remember enjoying it and almost crying at the end.  Released in 1977, PETE'S DRAGON is an overlooked gem in the Disney library.  The movie is mostly a live-action musical film with only a little bit of animation included when Elliot the Dragon becomes visible.The story opens with the young orphan boy Pete (Sean Marshall) running away from the cruel & crude family, the Gogans, who purchased him under the table from an orphanage and have been using him as slave labor.  It's later revealed in the movie that the Gogans not only used Pete as a slave, but also took pleasure in beating him. Pete is able to escape from the Gogan's with the aid of his best friend, an invisible dragon named Elliot. Elliot can appear visible and invisible at will, a gift that later causes Pete to get into all kinds of problems when the arrive in the small fishing village of Passamaquoddy.  After causing all kinds of chaos in Passamaquoddy, Pete meets Nora (Helen Reddy) the keeper of the lighthouse. Nora and her father, Lampie (Mickey Rooney) are sweet, caring, and fun-loving people and unlike anyone Pete has ever met. They take a liking to each other and it becomes clear that Nora intends to adopt Pete as her own son.  However, the unexpected arrival of a scheming snake-oil salesman named Doc Terminus (Jim Dale) and his assistant Hoagy (Red Buttons) and an unwelcomed appearance of the Gogans threaten Pete's newfound life and the very life of Elliot.The movie is filled with lovable, mostly cheery songs that will appeal to children. One of the movie's most memorable songs is ""Candle in the Water"".  The song is sung by Norah (Reddy) as she stands atop the lighthouse one night looking out to see and longing for the return of her finance who disappeared at sea over a year before.  The song comes almost directly at the halfway point of the movie and though it is a bit different in style and mood than the rest of the movie, it fits perfectly with the overall tone of the picture. The song was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, but lost to ""You Light Up My Life"" from a movie of the same name.  I also really enjoyed the song ""There's Room For Everyone"".I really enjoy PETE'S DRAGON and watching it again for the first time since college, it left me feeling quite happy, joyful, and hopeful.  The movie doesn't really break any new ground (though Disney did build a working lighthouse in Morro Bay, California and had to get special permission from the U.S. Coast Guard to light it), but it is full of nostalgia and captures an innocence that is lost.  I believe that this is why the movie is often overlooked.  For instance, though the movie doesn't really condone drinking, it does present those who drink in a humorous light.  For many, especially in a culture raised where drunken driving is one of the top reasons for deaths among young people, it's hard to understand why drunks are often funny. Or take the animation as another example.  Elliot is a very simply drawn character. He lacks much of the complexity that we've now grown used to in most all forms of animation nowadays. Yet, that's part of the point. Elliot is supposed to be simple because he harkens back to a time and place that is more simple.  Those raised in the age of CGI graphics and the top-notch almost lifelike animation of Pixar might not be able to appreciate the simplicity of Elliot.  That's a shame, but it says more about our culture and society than it does about PETE'S DRAGAON.Overall, PETE'S DRAGON is a delightful, charming, simple movie that perfectly captures the innocent of childhood and the power of imagination, as well as embodying a style of filmmaking that is rarely seen nowadays.  It's not great, but it is good and much better than the usual marketed ""family fare"" you'll see in cinemaplexes today.  It's an overlooked gem worth taking a few moments to examine and enjoy.Though it might seem there are a lot of special features on this High-Flying edition of PETE'S DRAGON, there really isn't.  The best special feature is the featurette ""Brazzle Dazzle Effects"". It's narrated by Sean Marshall, the guy who played Pete. He gives a history of live action & animation in films beginning with Walt Disney's silent Alice shorts starring Virginia Davis. Davis appears and talks about Walt Disney and her experiences acting in his shorts. The featurette makes a point to emphasize the contribution that Ub Iwerks made to Walt Disney's projects and his groundbreaking innovations that helped the Disney become such a powerful film studio.Other special features include a deleted storyboard sequence; the original song concept for ""Boo Bop Bop Bop Bop Bop (I Love You Too); the original demo recordings of three songs from the original idea for the movie, including a song for a deleted character; four songs from the original promotional record for the movie; art galleries; the international and theatrical trailers for the film; a short info screen containing production notes about the movie; an excerpt from the ""Disney Family Album"" about the artist who originally created Elliot, Ken Anderson; an excerpt from the Disneyland TV show that aired on Oct. 31, 1956 entitled ""The Plausible Impossible""; a children's game where they try to find where Elliot is hiding; and lastly the cartoon short ""Lighthouse Keeping"" featuring Donald Duck.",4,Forgotten & Overlooked Gem,1250812800,"08 21, 2009",2009,5545,"['When', 'was', 'college', 'good', 'friend', 'mine', 'had', 'several', 'other', 'friends', 'watch',
