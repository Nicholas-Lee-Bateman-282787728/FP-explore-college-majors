It has very little plot, the cinematography, locations, production values, costumes, etc. can generously be described as ""on a budget,"" the acting is mostly bloody awful (though in fairness, it might simply be that even the most gifted actors couldn't utter some of the lines of this film's dialogue believably), the special effects are about as cheesy as effects ever get, and the musical score is an unholy combination of orchestral music, meets spaghetti western, meets 1970s disco; all of which means this movie should be almost physically painful to watch, but somehow not only is it not, it's actually a blast, especially if you get together and watch it with a group of friends.  John Terry turns in a rather wooden, but nonetheless decent performance (and his seriousness plays well against the other actors, who are clearly just having fun while collecting the paycheck) as the hero, who is pitted against his evil older brother, played by a Jack Palance 25 years his senior, who not only killed their on-screen father, and Hawk's betrothed, but has now kidnapped a group of nuns and is holding them for ransom (are there no depths to which he will not sink!).  Hawk is aided by a blind witch who helps him assemble a band of comrades consisting of a one-handed man (who shoots a magic, self-cocking, repeating crossbow that has a rate of fire nearly that of a machine gun), a giant (who is just a really tall bald guy), a dwarf (who is really just a rather short guy with a bullwhip and gross eating habits), and an elf (whose acting is so phenomenally stiff and mechanical I suspect him of actually being a robot specially constructed for the film).No need to spoil the, uh... plot, for any interested viewers who may read this.  Suffice it to say that the movie really is every bit as bad as it sounds from reading this... and I almost guarantee you will enjoy it.  How this manages to be the case, I can't explain.  Other movies have bad plots, bad dialogue, bad acting, bad music, bad effects, etc., and are simply awful movies.  One watches them and wishes one could get that two hours of one's life back.  This movie is somehow different, and manages to be fun despite (and perhaps even because of) its numerous flaws.",4,"A good, even great, bad movie.",1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,2345,"['Everyone', 'can', 'think', 'one', 'movies', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'movie', 'king', 'kind', 'very', 'little', 'plot', 'cinematography', 'locations', 'production', 'values', 'costumes', 'etc', 'can', 'generously', 'be', 'described', 'budget', 'acting', 'mostly', 'bloody', 'awful', 'fairness', 'might', 'simply', 'be', 'even', 'most', 'gifted', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'utter', 'lines', 'film', 'dialogue', 'believably', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'as', 'cheesy', 'effects', 'ever', 'get', 'musical', 'score', 'unholy', 'combination', 'orchestral', 'music', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'meets', '1970s', 'disco', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'almost', 'physically', 'painful', 'watch', 'somehow', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'actually', 'blast', 'especially', 'get', 'together', 'watch', 'group', 'friends', 'John', 'Terry', 'rather', 'wooden', 'nonetheless', 'decent', 'performance', 'seriousness', 'well', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'collecting', 'paycheck', 'hero', 'who', 'pitted', 'evil', 'older', 'brother', 'played', 'Jack', 'Palance', '25', 'years', 'senior', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'killed', 'on-screen', 'father', 'Hawk', 'betrothed', 'now', 'kidnapped', 'group', 'nuns', 'holding', 'ransom', 'are', 'there', 'no', 'depths', 'will', 'not', 'sink', 'Hawk', 'aided', 'blind', 'witch', 'who', 'assemble', 'band', 'comrades', 'consisting', 'one-handed', 'man', 'who', 'shoots', 'magic', 'self-cocking', 'repeating', 'crossbow', 'rate', 'fire', 'nearly', 'machine', 'gun', 'giant', 'who', 'just', 'really', 'tall', 'bald', 'guy', 'dwarf', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'rather', 'short', 'guy', 'bullwhip', 'gross', 'eating', 'habits', 'elf', 'acting', 'so', 'phenomenally', 'stiff', 'mechanical', 'suspect', 'actually', 'being', 'robot', 'specially', 'constructed', 'film', 'need', 'spoil', 'uh', 'plot', 'interested', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'read', 'Suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'really', 'bit', 'as', 'bad', 'reading', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'will', 'enjoy', 'How', 'be', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'Other', 'movies', 'have', 'bad', 'plots', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'music', 'bad', 'effects', 'etc.', 'are', 'simply', 'awful', 'movies', 'One', 'one', 'could', 'get', 'two', 'hours', 'one', 'life', 'back', 'movie', 'somehow', 'different', 'be', 'fun', 'perhaps', 'even', 'numerous', 'flaws']",N/A

The special effects and sets were fairly laughable as well. So why the ""****"" rating? Because this movie is so bad it's good.I remember waiting to see this movie with a bunch of my Role Playing Game (Dungeons and Dragons, etc) friends when it first came out. Being in my mid-teens, and really into gaming, I thought this was the best movie ever. It wasn't until I had the chance to re-watch it as an adult (after telling my wife she HAD to see it... ooops) that I realized just how bad it really is. Despite the ribbing I took from my wife, this movie still gets played once or twice a year when I can't find something else to watch.Staring a tired looking Jack Palance as Voltan, the evil older brother of the young hero, Hawk (played by John Terry). This casting is just one of many funny choices the producers made since Palance was easily old enough to be Terry's father. There are several well known bit and characters in the movie and it's fun to see them cropping up in other shows from time to time.The real stars of the show were the ""repeating crossbow"" (AKA ""Machine Gun Crossbow"") and the somewhat spastic Elf who could unleash some 20 arrows in 5 or 6 seconds. That type of firepower was thing a young gamer geek could only dream about.All around, a fun movie and recommended if you happen to like really bad Sword and Sorcery movies!

715063,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00006G8H4,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[13, 24]","The early 80's saw a rash of sword and sorcery/fantasy films, Dragonslayer (1981), Conan the Barbarian (1982), The Beastmaster (1982), The Sword and The Sorcerer (1982), Krull (1983) primarily, in my humble opinion, to cash in on the popularity of the role playing game Dungeons and Dragons, which had been around since the mid 70's (has it been that long?)  As with any genre, there are sparkling gems, diamonds in the rough, and finally the bottom of the barrel, which is where Hawk the Slayer (1981) rests, hiding in obscurity...until now (seems many have fond memories of this film, so I doubt I'm going to many any friends with my review).Co-written and directed by Terry Marcel, who's got a few other credits to his name, but the one that stands out for me was his credit as a second unit director for the abysmal Trail of the Pink Panther (1982), Hawk the Slayer stars Jack `Believe it...or not!' Palance and John Terry (Full Metal Jacket, The Living Daylights) as `two brothers locked in deadly combat until the end of time!' or so it says on the front of the case.  Also appearing is Bernard Bresslaw (he was the Cyclops in Krull), Ray Charleson (Hopscotch), William Morgan Sheppard (The Duellists), Patrick Magee (A Clockwork Orange), and Roy Kinnear (Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo).  There are a few more I could list, but they'd probably appreciate it if I didn't...As the film begins, we see Voltan (Palance) threatening an old man for some sort of treasure (turns out the old man is Voltan's father, played by Ferdy Mayne, who was in his mid 60's at the time of this film, while Palance was in his early 60's...how is that supposed to work?  And the characters played by Palance and Terry are supposed to be brothers?  There's like a 30 year age difference...my head is beginning to hurt...)  Anyway, old timing dude doesn't give up whatever secret Voltan's looking for, and suffers dire consequences because Voltan is so very evil.  Just before his passing, the old man does share the secret with his other son, Hawk, played by John Terry.  What's the secret?  Something involving a mystical weapon called the Mind Sword, which Hawk now controls.  Apparently Hawk can control its' movements and it sometimes glows with a sickly green light, but that seems to be about it.  I suspect there's probably more to it, but the audience is never really let in on it...nice story telling there...so now Voltan is terrorizing the countryside with his meager band of henchmen, kidnaps a holy woman from a local abbey, and holds her for ransom.  The remaining sisters enlist an injured fighter to contact Hawk for help, to which Hawk, through the aid of a witchy woman, gathers a motley band of fighters including, a dwarf, an elf, and a giant in order to rescue the holy woman and defend the abbey against the onslaught of Voltan and his army.  Oh yeah, Hawk and Voltan have an old grudge, one involving a woman and an injury Voltan incurred, a nasty facial burn, one that forces him to wear a fancy colander on his head to hide his scars.I wanted to like this film, but there was too much working against it for that to happen.  First of all, it was funny watching Palance chewing up the scenery, but after awhile I felt embarrassed for him, but honestly, throughout the 70's and early 80's, Palance was notorious for `phoning' it in, rather, not putting much into his roles, apparently happy to pick up a check.  Terry`s Hawk is probably the most awkward, wooden character in the film, completely devoid of any life or emotion.  The other actors were alright, but they all suffered with one of the lamest scripts I've heard in a long time (the dialog is completely awful throughout Nun: If you had given them the gold we would have peace, Elf: The peace...of the dead.).  The directing ain't so hot either...poor and clunky transition shots, ridiculously pointless slow motion shots, lame flashbacks...the list goes on...and the music...ugh!  Late 70's/early 80's synthesized disco music wouldn't have been my first choice, as it hardly sets the mood.  Also, putting fake, pointy ears on someone doesn't make them an elf.  And just because someone is short, doesn't mean they're a dwarf.  The battle scenes were pitifully short, as the elf, who could shoot arrows quickly, along with the one-handed warrior armed with a crossbow that operated like a machine gun made quick work of most of the enemies, leaving very little for the fighters who didn't have ranged weapons.  I suppose that's for the best, as the few up close fight scenes were not choreographed very well.  And the weapons...they looked real, but lack authenticity of the time, appearing more like those weapons purchased from the backs of magazines...very ornate and pretty, but hardly functional.  The special effects are not terrible (except maybe the silly string and glowing ping pong balls), and I thought the matte paintings were nice, even if they looked completely phoney.  The plot...oh man...it veers all over the place, creating a sense of many random events tied together by the loosest of threads.The picture on this DVD looks surprisingly good, even though there's some soft graininess, especially in the beginning.  I suspect that's nothing to do with aging, but more so the original picture itself.  The audio is much better than I would have thought, as the dialog comes through clear and crisp (which may not be for the best, given the actual dialog, but whatever...)  There are a couple of special features, one being a trailer and the other a photo gallery of stills from the movie (what's the point?)  The price on this DVD a bit steep, but then I think the true fans won't min, as they're happy to see a  re-release this film to DVD, especially given its' relative obscurity.Cookieman108",2,"Like Lord

715064,A1YSNDCBNZU3W2,B00006G8H4,e5150,"[40, 44]","Sure, it's difficult to watch now, but this movie was pivotal in my formative years, having fuelled my love for fantasy as a pre-adolescent in the early 80s. I will forever champion it in a slagging match, and can't fully understand why some have turned on it as they've matured.In its time it was GOD, and one can plainly see the inspiration it had on the modern Lord of the Rings films, at least on Legolas' character. Crow, the elf in this film, and his rapid-fire bow work was quite an original concept regardless of how badly it was portrayed. Nowhere in LOTR does Tolkien refer to any of the fast paced archery skills as represented in the LOTR films, so somebody clearly took the quick-shooting elf concept from Hawk. As cheesy as it is here, it is still cool to watch, even though his robotic Vulcan-like performance is dreadful.For trivia buffs, Annette Crosbie, who plays the Abbess in Hawk, also gave the voice to Galadriel in the 1978 Bakshi animated Lord of the Rings.Don't misunderstand: I am certainly not comparing Hawk to Peter Jackson's LOTR films. NOTHING compares to those. All I'm saying is that I'm sure this film has given some inspiration to other fantasy filmmakers, with its unquestionably original take on certain concepts.Many of the actors here are plainly better than the script allows them to be, but Jack Palance is ridiculous as Hawk's older brother (he looks as old as their father), and his casting was completely ludicrous. Also, the film could do without the dwarf, and his demise is proof of that. It was chiefly directed at the Dungeons & Dragons audience, and probably succeeded in winning them overUltimately, as with Jackson's LOTR saga, the elf steals the show with his poorly editted dexterous bow work, which is always interesting to watch.I for one will never call this a ""bad"" movie, even though it's sorely lacking in many categories. It's actually closer to ""Dungeons and Dragons"" than the Dungeons and Dragons movie was! For its time it ruled, and I will always have a soft spot for it. Hawk the Slayer has a certain charm, in its attempt to take itself seriously, which cannot be denied.

715065,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00006G8H4,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 8]","""Hawk the Slayer"" reminds me why they don't make a lot of high fantasy movies -- most of them are pretty terrible, and they totally fail to sweep you up in the fantasy world. This movie not only has countless gaping plot holes, but it also has painfully clunky acting, a hilariously bad villain, and a cast of... a few dozen.As the movie begins, the evil prince Voltan (Jack Palance) kills his father (who looks younger than he does) because Daddy won't give him a Magic McGuffin. But before Daddy expires, his younger son Hawk (John Terry) is given the McGuffin in the form of a magic sword... which basically just comes to him when he thinks about it. You could get the same effect by training a dog to fetch it.But instead of walking down the hall and killing his murderous brother, Hawk sort of... wanders off into the woods and becomes a sort of knight errant.An unspecified number of years later, a wounded warrior is found and nursed back to health by a group of nuns, just before their Mother Superior is kidnapped by Voltan for... some reason. So the warrior sets out in search of Hawk, who in turn uses a sorceress he saved to help him find his old buddies -- an always-hungry dwarf, a rather small giant, and an elf in orange pajamas.I honestly wish that I could have liked ""Hawk the Slayer,"" but there were just too many things wrong with it. For one thing, it obviously had a very, very low budget -- at times it looks like it was shot in someone's backyard for about $15 and snacks.  Seriously, the evil green forest is about twenty feet long!And honestly, the acting is awful. Palance chews the scenery like a piece of gum, managing to be both hammy and wooden. Terry is just a wooden ""noble hero with a tragic past,"" who doesn't even show any emotions when his loved ones are killed in front of him, and most of the supporting cast is just bland and underdeveloped. The only saving grace of this story is the dwarf -- the actor plays his role with lots of gusto, and he's the only one who seems to be having fun.The worst miscast: Ray Charleson as Crow, an elf archer who runs around with Spock ears, orange pajamas and a horribly nasal flat voice. Any shreds of coolness or ethereality this elf has die as soon as he opens his mouth.Director Terry Marcel obviously has a lot of passion for this story, but not much talent -- most of the movie consists of Hawk and his posse and/or Voltan and all four of his thugs wandering around, talking a lot and occasionally fighting someone. And not only is the plot full of holes, but it's littered with stuff that is just never explained (like the elf, dwarf and giant all being the last of their species... WHY?).""Hawk the Slayer"" has high aspirations, but not the talent to carry it off.

715066,A2TUCS8O6AJXKJ,B00006G8H4,"-- ""--""","[8, 11]","Director Courtney Solomon once proudly proclaimed that his in-the-works fantasy film would be the polar opposite of a little-known fantasy flick called ""Hawk the Slayer."" This is more than a little amusing, given that a few months later his film, ""Dungeons & Dragons: The Movie"", hit theaters and critics, laymen, and even avid D&D; fans found it hard to stomach. Using ""Hawk the Slayer"" as a demonstration, Solomon said, ""This is exactly the kind of fantasy movie I don't want to make."" The strange thing is, he pretty much made the modern equivalent. Both movies are enjoyably bad fantasy fare that cannot be taken very seriously despite their attempts at earnestness, and therefore demand to be watched by more open-minded fantasy fanatics with an eccentric taste for the absurd.""Hawk the Slayer"" tells the tale of... well, Hawk, who isn't much of a slayer, when it comes right down to it. Hawk is instead a noble prince with a magical sword seeking vengeance upon his eldest brother, who in turn couldn't help but be evil since he was named Voltan. I presume this is why Voltan kills his own father, for giving him such a ridiculous name. At any rate, this patricide sparks Hawk's fury (as if Voltan's slaying of his beloved weren't enough), and the prince sets out to rid the land of his brother, and amass a band of companions along the way. Much of the film centers around the compilation of Hawk's adventuring band, and each and every one of them is in deep trouble just as Hawk happens upon them - wouldn't you know it? Hawk, A giant (who must be short for his race), an elf (who looks the part but speaks like a cyborg parody), a dwarf, an aging knight (with only one arm and a crossbow that must reload itself in mid-battle), and a blind sorceress are all that stand between Voltan and the so-called Devil's Agents from conquering the world. This is rather funny since Voltan comes off as a less-than-powerful nuisance and nothing more. Still, it's hard not to admire an effort that comes from 1980 and works with presumably limited coffers. These things must be taken into consideration - although the dreaded puppet-monster from the Forest of Were is still unforgivable. If you don't have the means to actually create a believable monster, don't bother trying... That should be Rule #1 when making a low-budget fantasy movie, but it happens a lot.In the end, ""Hawk the Slayer"" is bad, let's be honest. However, if you like fantasy AND you appreciate bad movies, ""Hawk the Slayer"" should easily fit the bill. The acting is generally horrendous (Jack Palance and Hawk himself are the biggest offenders - but boy are they funny!), the storyline is trite and predictable, and the film's reach is far beyond its means... but, hey, at least it's not ""Deathstalker,"" right?[Kudos to Hen's Tooth video for releasing this on DVD]",3,Honestly...,1038873600,"12 3, 2002",2002,2833,"['Director', 'Courtney', 'Solomon', 'once', 'proudly', 'proclaimed', 'in-the-works', 'fantasy', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'polar', 'opposite', 'little-known', 'fantasy', 'flick', 'called', 'Hawk', 'Slayer', 'more', 'little', 'amusing', 'given', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'film', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'Movie', 'hit', 'theaters', 'critics', 'laymen', 'even', 'avid', 'D', 'D', 'fans', 'found', 'hard', 'stomach', 'Using', 'Hawk', 'Slayer', 'demonstration', 'Solomon', 'said', 'exactly', 'kind', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'strange', 'thing', 'pretty', 'much', 'made', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'movies', 'are', 'enjoyably', 'bad', 'fantasy', 'fare', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'very', 'seriously', 'attempts', 'earnestness', 'therefore', 'demand', 'be', 'watched', 'more', 'open-minded', 'fantasy', 'fanatics', 'eccentric', 'taste', 'absurd', 'Hawk', 'Slayer', 'tale', 'well', 'Hawk', 'who', ""n't"", 'much', 'slayer', 'when', 'right', 'down', 'Hawk', 'instead', 'noble', 'prince', 'magical', 'sword', 'seeking', 'vengeance', 'eldest', 'brother', 'who', 'turn', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'evil', 'was', 'named', 'Voltan', 'presume', 'why', 'Voltan', 'own', 'father', 'giving', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'name', 'rate', 'patricide', 'Hawk', 'fury', 'Voltan', 'slaying', 'beloved', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'prince', 'out', 'rid', 'land', 'brother', 'amass', 'band', 'companions', 'way', 'Much', 'film', 'centers', 'compilation', 'Hawk', 'adventuring', 'band', 'one', 'deep', 'trouble', 'just', 'Hawk', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'Hawk', 'A', 'giant', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'short', 'race', 'elf', 'who', 'part', 'cyborg', 'parody', 'dwarf', 'aging', 'knight', 'only', 'one', 'arm', 'crossbow', 'must', 'reload', 'mid-battle', 'blind', 'sorceress', 'are', 'stand', 'Voltan', 'so-called', 'Devil', 'Agents', 'conquering', 'world', 'rather', 'funny', 'Voltan', 'off', 'less-than-powerful', 'nuisance', 'nothing', 'more', 'Still', 'hard', 'not', 'admire', 'effort', '1980', 'presumably', 'limited', 'coffers', 'things', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'consideration', 'dreaded', 'puppet-monster', 'Forest', 'Were', 'still', 'unforgivable', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'means', 'actually', 'create', 'believable', 'monster', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'trying', 'should', 'be', 'Rule', '1', 'when', 'making', 'low-budget', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'lot.In', 'end', 'Hawk', 'Slayer', 'bad', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'However', 'like', 'fantasy', 'AND', 'appreciate', 'bad', 'movies', 'Hawk', 'Slayer', 'should', 'easily', 'fit', 'bill', 'acting', 'generally', 'horrendous', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'Hawk', 'are', 'biggest', 'offenders', 'boy', 'are', 'funny', 'storyline', 'trite', 'predictable', 'film', 'reach', 'far', 'means', 'hey', 'least', 'not', 'Deathstalker', 'right', '[', 'Kudos', 'Hen', 'Tooth', 'video', 'releasing', 'DVD', ']']",N/A

That power being a magical mindsword with a glowing green handle that can fall into your hand if you think about it (and run the film backwards).Mind you, as flashbacks later reveal, the evil Darth Voltan (okay, he's not really called Darth) has already killed the love of Hawk's life, something which almost shocks one-time Felix Leiter (in The Living Daylights) John Terry into changing his expression, before moving on to underline what a bad egg he is by kidnapping guest star Annette Crosbie's Mother Superior, prompting Hawk into action. Well, not exactly action, more riding around the same stretch of woodlands while ineffectually ripping off The Magnificent Seven and A Fistful of Dollars (you half expect John Terry to say ""My pony don't like Begin' laughed at."") as he assembles his A-Team - a giant played by Carry On veteran Bernard Bresslaw, an elfin bowman who talks like a constipated Dalek, a not particularly short dwarf and Patricia Quinn's witch with a particularly naff line in sorcery involving, er, smokey eggs. But then it's pretty obvious that the budget didn't really stretch to much in the way of even the cheapest special effects, with those there are largely of the stopping-the-camera-and-starting-it-again after-the-actors-have-left-the-frame variety, alongside a magic neon hula-hoop left over from some disco movie, a pair of Spock ears from a novelty shop and, in one memorable killing, silly string (or as the DVD chapter stop calls it 'The silly string of death'). And my, didn't they get a good deal on the fog machine that week!Long shots also seem a bit of an alien concept for director Terry Marcel, who cut his teeth as a third assistant director on Carry On Cleo and never seems to have scaled those lofty peaks again. Most of the film is played in medium shot to cut down on the number of actors required and to hide the fact the set isn't that big - or perhaps just out of the fear that if they move the camera too far back, the actors will take the opportunity to run away before they have to deliver lines like ""My son Drogo speaks true!"" ""Even as we speak, the wizards gather in the south"" or serial overactor Shane Briant's immortal ""I am no messenger. But I will give you a message. The message of DEATH!""Jack Palance doesn't get much good dialogue either, but chews on what he gets for more than it's worth anyway - he's the only actor who could make the word ""Wiiiiizzzzzaaaaaahhhrrrrrrdddddd!!!!!"" last almost as long as Hamlet's soliloquy, so it's a shock to see how relaxed and, well, normal he looks in the raw onset interviews on the UK DVD (where he expresses far more admiration for Dinsdale Landen than Elia Kazan). Although even he might have balked at Bernard Bresslaw's defiant ""I'd sooner eat cowdung."" (Met with the inevitable response ""That can be arranged, and you can wash it down with your own blood if need be."") Indeed, when Hawk addresses Patricia Quinn as ""Woman"" - as in ""Woman, we need the use of your magic"" - you half expect her to reply ""I'm a man. I'm not old, I'm 37. What I object to is you automatically treat me like an inferior. Oh, Slayer eh? Very nice. And how'd you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers. By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society. Just because some dying character actor lobs a mindsword at you is no basis for a system of government.""Sadly much of the film is more dull than unintentionally funny: writer-producers Marcel and Harry Robertson clearly intended this, you know, for kids, so it's a bloodless school panto affair for much of the running time, visually bland and lethargic even at a modest hour-and-a-half. How they expected to stretch it out to a series of five movies is anyone's guess (the film ended up as the supporting feature to Saturn Three). Still, on the plus side former pop star and Hammer and Children's' Film Foundation regular composer Harry Robertson (who wrote the superb Hammer Transylvanian Western score for Twins of Evil as Harry Robinson - it really is outstandingly good) turns in a score that's like a demented disco combination of an Ennio Morricone paella Western and Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds, and the film is nowhere near as soul-destroyingly awful as Marcel and Robertson's subsequent collaboration seven years later, the almost unwatchable-even-at-gunpoint Jane and the Lost City.Naturally for a naff movie this boasts a good UK DVD, with Network's PAL DVD offering a superb transfer (but then it's not as if the negative got much use) and an array of more on-set interviews than any sane individual could ever want to watch, including one great moment where Marcel is asked if it's true he turned down a $10m budget because he didn't want to cast big names: ""That's a load of rubbish"" he replies while trying not to burst out laughing.",2,"""The hunchback will have something to say about this!""",1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,5641,"['Yes', 'time', 'travel', 'back', 'dying', 'days', 'Lew', 'Grade', 'ITC',
