107203,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790740044,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","As a kid, I was a fan of Chevy Chase.  He just had this knack for dry humored physical comedy that made me smile every time.  As an adult, I'm not entirely smitten with his every role and I tend to find many flaws in the films that, as a child, I thought were hilarious.  Still, some of those comedic favorites of my youth still hold up and wind up remaining memorable enough.  `Funny Farm' is one of those films.  It isn't perfect, but it has a more toned down tone if you will.  It keeps an even comedic tone that doesn't falter due to outrageous antics that don't land properly.  Instead, `Funny Farm' maintains the funny.Here, Chase plays a sportswriter who gives up his career and city life to move out the country and write the great American novel (why does every writer feel this is a necessity?) but what he finds instead of greener pastures and inspiration is creepy crawlies and a lot of crazies.  When his wife starts flourishing creatively the tension in the marriage begins to chip away at the marriage and soon they are trying to repair the pieces by escaping the country altogether.Like I said, it maintains a tone that is a welcome change of pace for Chase, giving him slightly elevated material to work with and a script that requires him to be himself, just in a more admirable setting.  He nails his role, and the supporting players (especially Madolyn Smith-Osborne) offer their assistance splendidly.",4,Funny for sure...,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,1422,"['kid', 'was', 'fan', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'just', 'had', 'knack', 'dry', 'humored', 'physical', 'comedy', 'made', 'smile', 'time', 'adult', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'smitten', 'role', 'tend', 'find', 'many', 'flaws', 'films', 'child', 'thought', 'were', 'hilarious', 'Still', 'comedic', 'favorites', 'youth', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'wind', 'up', 'remaining', 'memorable', 'enough', 'Funny', 'Farm', 'one', 'films', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'more', 'toned', 'down', 'tone', 'will', 'even', 'comedic', 'tone', ""n't"", 'falter', 'due', 'outrageous', 'antics', 'do', ""n't"", 'land', 'properly', 'Instead', 'Funny', 'Farm', 'funny.Here', 'Chase', 'sportswriter', 'who', 'up', 'career', 'city', 'life', 'move', 'out', 'country', 'write', 'great', 'American', 'novel', 'why', 'writer', 'feel', 'necessity', 'what', 'instead', 'greener', 'pastures', 'inspiration', 'creepy', 'crawlies', 'lot', 'crazies', 'When', 'wife', 'flourishing', 'creatively', 'tension', 'marriage', 'chip', 'away', 'marriage', 'soon', 'are', 'trying', 'repair', 'pieces', 'escaping', 'country', 'altogether.Like', 'said', 'tone', 'welcome', 'change', 'pace', 'Chase', 'giving', 'slightly', 'elevated', 'material', 'work', 'script', 'be', 'just', 'more', 'admirable', 'setting', 'role', 'supporting', 'players', 'especially', 'Madolyn', 'Smith-Osborne', 'offer', 'assistance', 'splendidly']",N/A
107204,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,0790740044,andy8047,"[1, 2]","In 1988,Warner Bros. distributed this hilarious comedy starring Chevy Chase as Andy Farmer,a freelance novelist. Madolyn Smith is Andy's wife who also writes. The Farmers move to a new home in the country,uncovering a few unpleasant surprises such as an unofficially interred corpse. The corpse is taken into police custody and moved to a cemetery. For the Farmers' wedding anniversary,the wife gets Andy a dog,but it immediately runs away. Then they get another dog that doesn't run away. Andy named it ""Yellow Dog"" because of the dog's fur color. The Farmers' marriage ends up on the rocks. What started that was Andy's wife immensely disliking Andy's not-yet-finished novel. Angry Andy throws it into the couple's burning fireplace(I hope you're happy,Mrs. Critic!""). She wanted it destroyed,I think. With plans for divorce in progress,the Farmers' house is on the real estate market. By Christmas,the Farmers have reconciled their differences,called off their divorce and the sale of their home. The film ends with the Farmers at a baseball game. This film was one of the many Chase has made since leaving NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1976. SNL was what drove Chase to superstardom. Smith's previous film credits include URBAN COWBOY and ALL OF ME.

Ironically, through all of this he loses his inspiration to write, but his teacher wife finds it and writes a successful children's book after she finds a stuffed squirrel in an antique shop. Of course, he gets jealous because the novel he wrote couldn't match it and they decide at last, to sell the house.

All the characters are perfectly cast.  You don't have to be a Chevy Chase fan to love him as Andy; it is the best acting he has ever done. Madolyn Smith is simply wonderful as the only character centered in reality while all the quirky and charming characters in this movie, her husband included, live in another world altogether.  After Andy repeatedly waxes rhapsodic about settlers 100 years ago to romanticize one screw-up after the other, she finally smacks him in the forehead with her palm claiming it was a mosquito.  When she has a children's book published, she plays her husband lovingly like a finely-tuned instrument, stroking his dented ego, telling him the main character (a squirrel named Andy)is a tribute to him and that he was her inspiration, not admitting little Andy gets hit by a truck at the end of the first book, until after he warms to the idea that she, not he, actually wrote a book and lets her have his typewriter and desk.  Of course he unravels anyway, leading to the hi-lite -- the entire town turning into a Norman Rockwell scene to help the Farmers sell their home... no, not to help the Farmers, but for the $50 promised to each townsperson who participates (""cue the deer"").

Films like Spies Like Us, Nothing But Trouble and Funny Farm have went largely unseen since the advent of DVD in 1997. Neither of these movies have received widescreen releases and have been out of print for years. I was beginning to wonder what Warner had against giving them definitive releases until I discovered an HD master of Funny Farm on the PlayStation Network.I saw it only once, when I was about 9, and remembered very little. If you're a fan of Clark Griswold then Andy Farmer isn't too far removed. Andy is a sports journalist who retires from the big city to the Redbud, Vermont hoping to enjoy and idyllic, peaceful life and finally write the great, American novel (The Big Heist). When he gets there he and his wife discover that almost everyone and everything is weirder than the last. There are giant snakes in their pond, a dead body buried in their garden, a Sheriff who can't drive, a crazy mailman and a town who basically hate them. And top of all this Andy has severe writer's block while his wife manages to churn out a successful children's novel without really trying.With careful, measured direction from George Roy Hill (Butch Cassidy, The Sting) Funny Farm, based on a novel by Jay Cronley, manages to be a little classier than Chase's usual fare. This makes the lack of a home video version even more puzzling. It has never been released on DVD in the UK, and the 1989 VHS is long gone. If you have access to the PlayStation Network then go for it. I have a funny feeling that Funny Farm and Spies Like Us will probably be released as a Warner Blu Ray Double Feature in the near future, but nothing has been announced so far.Don't let the mistreatment of this film put you off, it lives up to it's title and is the perfect vehicle for Chevy Chase and his goofy humour.",4,Would you like Lamb Fries with that?,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,1943,"['Chevy', 'Chase', 'normally', 'associated', 'Caddyshack', 'Fletch', 'Vacation', 'series', 'meaning', 'one-shot', 'movies', 'mostly', 'fall', 'wayside', 'Films', 'Spies', 'Us', 'Nothing', 'Trouble', 'Funny', 'Farm', 'have', 'went', 'largely', 'unseen', 'advent', 'DVD', '1997', 'movies', 'have', 'received', 'widescreen', 'releases', 'have', 'been', 'print', 'years', 'was', 'beginning', 'wonder', 'what', 'Warner', 'had', 'giving', 'definitive', 'releases', 'discovered', 'HD', 'master', 'Funny', 'Farm', 'PlayStation', 'Network.I', 'saw', 'only', 'once', 'when', 'was', 'about', '9', 'remembered', 'very', 'little', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Clark', 'Griswold', 'then', 'Andy', 'Farmer', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'Andy', 'sports', 'journalist', 'who', 'big', 'city', 'Redbud', 'Vermont', 'hoping', 'enjoy', 'idyllic', 'peaceful', 'life', 'finally', 'write', 'great', 'American', 'novel', 'Big', 'Heist', 'When', 'there', 'wife', 'discover', 'almost', 'everyone', 'everything', 'weirder', 'last', 'are', 'giant', 'snakes', 'pond', 'dead', 'body', 'buried', 'garden', 'Sheriff', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drive', 'crazy', 'mailman', 'town', 'who', 'basically', 'hate', 'top', 'Andy', 'severe', 'writer', 'block', 'wife', 'churn', 'out', 'successful', 'children', 'novel', 'really', 'trying.With', 'careful', 'measured', 'direction', 'George', 'Roy', 'Hill', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sting', 'Funny', 'Farm', 'based', 'novel', 'Jay', 'Cronley', 'be', 'little', 'classier', 'Chase', 'usual', 'fare', 'lack', 'home', 'video', 'version', 'even', 'more', 'puzzling', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'UK', '1989', 'VHS', 'long', 'gone', 'have', 'access', 'PlayStation', 'Network', 'then', 'go', 'have', 'funny', 'feeling', 'Funny', 'Farm', 'Spies', 'Us', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'released', 'Warner', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Double', 'Feature', 'near', 'future', 'nothing', 'been', 'announced', 'so', 'far.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'mistreatment', 'film', 'put', 'off', 'up', 'title', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'goofy', 'humour']",N/A

She cannot act at all and she lacks the likability of Beverly Deangelo who did an excellent job playing Chase's wife. Madolyn Smith has no talent whatsoever. She seemed more like a Calvin Klein jeans model. It is Chevy Chase who turns the movie around and makes it entertaining. His genius is very evident right from the first scene. This is still not his best work by far. He was awesome in Fletch and the Vacation movies. Seems like Old times and Foul Play were also some of his finest work. The premise of city slickers who think that country life is heaven on earth and then finding out that it isn't is very entertaining. His wife's character is poorly written and comes across as a selfish and self serving irritant. It is only Chase who keeps the movie flowing. Just like Jack Nicholson did in the original Batman with Michael Keaton. The story is so cliche ridden until the town pretends to be from a Norman Rockwell painting. That part was classic.

It is funny, wry, and deftly humorous.The plot is simple. A sportswriter from New York, Andy Farmer (Chevy Chase), and his wife, Elizabeth (Madolyn Smith-Osborne), decide to move to the country so that he can write his great American novel. They move to rural Redbud, Vermont, and instead of a bucolic, pastoral setting with friendly, kindly, country folk, they find snakes, a postman who maniacally drinks and drives, a sheriff who can't drive a car, a corpse in their back yard, and a whole slew of the weirder than weird.Instead of writing the great American novel, Andy only manages to turn out some useless drivel, while Elizabeth turns out a charming children's book. This causes great friction between the two, and it looks as if their sojourn in the country, as well as their marriage, is to be a brief one. They decide to move back to New York and inveigle the entire town of Redbud to assist them in selling their house, by turning the town and its environs into a warm and cozy setting out of a Norman Rockwell painting. What happens next is quite funny.Just about every one in the film is a little wacky, with the exception of Andy's wife, Elizabeth, who is the one sane, grounded character. Madolyn Smith-Osborne gives an excellent performance as the wife. She is a perfect comedic foil. Chevy Chase as Andy is well...Chevy Chase and, as always, funny.

107340,A38G64S5VMRI1P,0790740044,Robert Graves,"[3, 4]","""Funny Farm"" is a harmless comedy from Chevy Chase's prime that is easy to watch and like. For me it's had a longevity, and I tend to throw in the DVD a few times a month to run in the background while I'm working.It's the story of Andy Farmer, a sportswriter turned novelist, who moves to the New England countryside with his wife Elizabeth to write the great American novel. The little town they choose is called Redbud, a seemingly quaint Northeastern village. At first glance, everything is beyond perfect. The house and property are spectacular, enough to make any viewer of the film want to pack up their typewriters and move immediately. But slowly the dream crumbles. The movers get lost, the mailman is a psychopathic drunk, a corpse is discovered in the garden, they have no phone to call the police, Andy makes some enemies from the locals, the writing is laboriously slow, and his dog runs away. The Farmers discover they aren't quite suited for country life, despite their valiant efforts to embrace it. This fact reaches its apex when, in a very funny scene, Andy sets the record for the most ""lambfries"" consumed in one setting at the local diner. Only after breaking the record does he find out they are actually saut&eacute;ed sheep testicles.This is the start of a long night for Andy, who, in taking his wife out for a romantic night at Sid's Hideaway Bungalows, presents her with the first few chapters of his novel, insisting she read it right then and there. This whole sequence is classic for any writer, since we've all been there. Andy watches his wife read the first page and, when she doesn't crack even a smile, he feels the need to point out the funny parts that she should've laughed at. He reluctantly leaves her alone to finish it and goes out for wine. Her response upon completion? Tears. She goes on to describe in painful detail why the story (which they've pinned their hopes and dreams on) is an utter disaster. Her diatribe ends with a suggestion to burn it, which he does in a retaliatory fury.To make things worse, Elizabeth has written a children's book behind Andy's back, which has been accepted for publication. The story? A squirrel from the city ends up in the country and completely out of his element, everything he tries to do turning to disaster. The squirrel's name? Andy. This only adds insult to injury and drives a wedge between them. Andy sinks into depression, and the last straw for Elizabeth is when Andy gives a copy of her manuscript to his publisher, passing it off as his own work (since he hasn't written a thing since the script-burning incident). She leaves him.Up to this point the movie is pretty good. It has funny moments (if you like Chevy Chase, which I do), good characters, unique story ideas, etc. And then it just derails into that generi-comedy that suffocated many films in this era (like ""Real Genius"" and ""Weird Science"" for example, funny films that just exploded into some alternate universe in act 3). Instead of getting a divorce, which will take months to finalize, they decide to ask the citizens of Redbud to emulate Norman Rockwell paintings of ""normal"" small-town life so that when prospective buyers of their house come to town, they will be so impressed with Redbud they will just have to buy it. In return for this, Andy and Elizabeth will give the town $10,000 plus $50 to each person witnessed doing an act of ""Rockwellian"" normalcy.What? How does this even remotely fit in to the rest of the story? First of all, it doesn't do anything for the problem of the divorce or the time frame involved to get it done. Second, they did nothing to establish that there would be any problems whatsoever in selling the house, even without the help of the Redbud townspeople. Lastly, it was completely unnecessary and unbelievable. They simply would've moved back to the city, gotten real attorneys and had their divorce finalized within weeks. End of story. The house would've been sold when it sold, the money divided up in the settlement, whatever. It just didn't make any sense, in reality or in the context of the film.Even within this bizarre plot twist, however, there are still plenty of funny moments, and eventually we are led to the happy ending. Apparently the faade the Redbudians put on is so good it fools even Andy and Elizabeth back into buying the dream they had abandoned. They decide to stay married and keep the house. Andy gives up his dream of writing a novel and takes a job as a local sportswriter. The end.Another significant point to mention is the unique structure to the film. Well, that was kind. I suppose other critics might say *lack* of structure to the film, but either way it's unconventional. There really isn't a major act turning point until over an hour into the movie (not counting his uprooting from the city - this would normally occur fifteen to twenty-five minutes into a film), then the Redbud deal finally brings us into the next act, and act 3 is just a couple of minutes of voice-over by Andy. The structure is there, just unusual, and I think it's what makes the movie stand out more than the average 90s comedy.One more thing. Chevy relies heavily on his patented comedy and you really can't distinguish a difference between Andy Farmer and Clark Griswold. He even uses some of the same lines (""A hundred years ago the settlers didn't need electricity or phones...""). True, this is a problem, but for those of us that love Clark Griswold it's easily bearable.Lastly, I'll mention the DVD is completely impoverished. There are literally no special features to be heard of. I think you're safe to buy this though; although a fun little movie that's comfortable like an old pair of jeans, I don't really expect to see a special edition of ""Funny Farm"" coming out anytime

First, I can do long division without a calculator.  Second, he makes Bill Murray look like Richard Burton.  Third, Nicole Kidman's face contains more plastic than a Volvo.  I hate to admit it, but this film is very amusing.  I give Chevy Chase about 10% of the credit.  Maybe 10.6%.  He ably provides the key, pivotal emotional moments that propel the story forward.  Like a dog urinating on a Mormon.  You just can't turn away.  The rest of the credit goes to an awesome cast populated by some of the funniest characters and most clever situations you have ever seen in a movie about mammals.  Okay, okay, but I've seen this film about a dozen times and it cracks me up every time.  I was in a mine shaft explosion as a child and it's not easy getting me to laugh at the same joke more than twice.

Chevy Chase is a big city sports writer who decides to give up city live and move to the quaint New England town of Redbud, Vermont to write a crime novel.  He's accompanied by his wife played by Madolyn Smith.Well in classic Murphy's law, everything that can go wrong, does go wrong.  They get to their new house and find that their furniture is late arriving, they have no phone, their mailman is a nut who tosses the mail out as he speeds by, and they have a body buried on their property.Chase tries to acclimate himself to the new townfolk by filling in in a fishing contest...promptly hooking one of his partners in the neck with the fishing hook.  In an attempt to remove the hook Chase punches the hapless man to try and knock him out.  This prompts one of the other men to say, &quot;you're not knocking him out, you're just beating the Sh*t out of him!&quot;Throughout, Chase battles the crazed mailman as well as the rest of the nutty townfolk who are like demented members of Hooterville.Later they decide and sell their dreamhouse and offer to pay the townspeople to act normal for just one day to impress the prospective buyers.  They put on a show right out of a Norman Rockwell painting as its now during the Christmas season.  funny stuff.Chase is at his finest as the put upon writer, becoming slightly more crazed himself with everyday he spends in redbud.

107367,A96K1ZGW56S2I,0790740044,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","Released in 1988 and based off the best-selling novel of the same name by Jay Cronley, FUNNY FARM stars Chevy Chase as Andy Farmer. Andy is a sportswriter from New York who decides to retire and move to the country with his wife Elizabeth (Madolyn Smith-Osborne) to write his great American novel. The couple has purchased a home outside of Redbud, Vermont.From appearances, Redbud appears to be a town straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting (a similarity distinctly mentioned later in the movie). However, the small, rural, Northeastern town has all the charm of the dysfunctional family from MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE. The local mailman is a drunk who by the time he gets to the end of his route at the Farmer residence he's so plastered that his truck is a rusty killing machine that will run over anything in sight. The local sheriff can't drive a car because he keeps failing his driving test, the pond at the Farmer residence is filled with giant snakes, and the Farmer's discover that one of the previous owners of their home buried a corpse in their flower garden. Andy tries to focus on writing his novel, but all he can seem to produce is a mish-mash of genres containing a mixture of clich&eacute;s and tripe. On the other hand, Elizabeth puts pen to paper and discovers she's quite the storyteller and soon becomes a best-selling children's author. Her success and Andy's failure cause for some dramatic friction that leads to a crazy finale.There are a lot of hilarious scenes. Two of my favorites are when Andy and Elizabeth first buy a dog and take it home and the other is when Andy becomes the new lamb fries champion at a local diner.Acting-wise, Chevy Chase is at the top of his game here. Also, notable is Madolyn Smith-Osborne as Elizabeth who proves to be a great foil for Chase.Compared to other Chevy Chase vehicles, FUNNY FARM is one of the better Chevy Chase-driven movies. It's not quite in the realm of the FLETCH movies, but it's just as good and has a similar feel as NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION. Both NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION and FUNNY FARM have threads of nostalgia woven throughout, but whereas NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION focuses on a family trip away from home, FUNNY FARM focuses on a journey to a new house and turning that house into a home.There is some foul language in the movie which might offend some people. Personally, I didn't mind the language becomes it seems appropriate when it's used.Also, it should be noted that FUNNY FARM was the last movie that George Roy Hill directed.Overall, FUNNY FARM is a great comedy that most everyone in the family can enjoy. I wasn't even twelve when I first saw the movie in theatres with my parents and siblings. I thought it was funny then and decades later after re-watching it again for the umpteenth time, I find it just as funny.",5,An Education in Country Living,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,2821,"['Released', '1988', 'based', 'off', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Jay', 'Cronley', 'FUNNY', 'FARM', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Andy', 'Farmer', 'Andy', 'sportswriter', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'retire', 'move', 'country', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Madolyn', 'Smith-Osborne', 'write', 'great', 'American', 'novel', 'couple', 'purchased', 'home', 'Redbud', 'Vermont.From', 'appearances', 'Redbud', 'be', 'town', 'straight', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'painting', 'similarity', 'distinctly', 'mentioned', 'later', 'movie', 'However', 'small', 'rural', 'Northeastern', 'town', 'charm', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'MALCOLM', 'IN', 'THE', 'MIDDLE', 'local', 'mailman', 'drunk', 'who', 'time', 'end', 'route', 'Farmer', 'residence', 'so', 'plastered', 'truck', 'rusty', 'killing', 'machine', 'will', 'run', 'over', 'anything', 'sight', 'local', 'sheriff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drive', 'car', 'failing', 'driving', 'test', 'pond', 'Farmer', 'residence', 'filled', 'giant', 'snakes', 'Farmer', 'discover', 'one', 'previous', 'owners', 'home', 'buried', 'corpse', 'flower', 'garden', 'Andy', 'focus', 'writing', 'novel', 'can', 'seem', 'produce', 'mish-mash', 'genres', 'containing', 'mixture', 'clich', 'eacute', 'tripe', 'other', 'hand', 'Elizabeth', 'pen', 'paper', 'quite', 'storyteller', 'soon', 'best-selling', 'children', 'author', 'success', 'Andy', 'failure', 'cause', 'dramatic', 'friction', 'crazy', 'are', 'lot', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'Two', 'favorites', 'are', 'when', 'Andy', 'Elizabeth', 'first', 'buy', 'dog', 'take', 'home', 'other', 'when', 'Andy', 'new', 'lamb', 'fries', 'champion', 'local', 'diner.Acting-wise', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'Also', 'notable', 'Madolyn', 'Smith-Osborne', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'be', 'great', 'foil', 'Chase.Compared', 'other', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'vehicles', 'FUNNY', 'FARM', 'one', 'better', 'Chevy', 'Chase-driven', 'movies', 'not', 'quite', 'realm', 'FLETCH', 'movies', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'similar', 'feel', 'NATIONAL', 'LAMPOON', 'VACATION', 'NATIONAL', 'LAMPOON', 'VACATION', 'FUNNY', 'FARM', 'have', 'threads', 'nostalgia', 'woven', 'whereas', 'NATIONAL', 'LAMPOON', 'VACATION', 'family', 'trip', 'away', 'home', 'FUNNY', 'FARM', 'journey', 'new', 'house', 'turning', 'house', 'home.There', 'foul', 'language', 'movie', 'might', 'offend', 'people', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'language', 'appropriate', 'when', 'used.Also', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'FUNNY', 'FARM', 'was', 'last', 'movie', 'George', 'Roy', 'Hill', 'directed.Overall', 'FUNNY', 'FARM', 'great', 'comedy', 'most', 'everyone', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'twelve', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'theatres', 'parents', 'siblings', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'then', 'decades', 'later', 're-watching', 'again', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'find', 'just', 'funny']",N/A
