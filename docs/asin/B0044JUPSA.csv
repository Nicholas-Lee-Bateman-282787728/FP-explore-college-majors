I had only seen in in black and white a couple times before, in the days before color tv,  This time I noticed that he was riding a big sorrel that might have been the daddy for his palomino Starlight that he rode in most of his later westerns.  It was a fun western based on a Zane Grey story and with all the action that we came to expect from westerns made at that time.  A great addition to my collection.",5,Great Fun,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,480,"['was', 'great', 'fun', 'seeing', 'Scott', 'movie', 'color', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'black', 'white', 'couple', 'times', 'before', 'days', 'color', 'tv', 'time', 'noticed', 'was', 'riding', 'big', 'sorrel', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'daddy', 'palomino', 'Starlight', 'rode', 'most', 'later', 'westerns', 'was', 'fun', 'western', 'based', 'Zane', 'Grey', 'story', 'action', 'came', 'expect', 'westerns', 'made', 'time', 'great', 'addition', 'collection']",N/A
