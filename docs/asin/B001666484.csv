1152258,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,B001666484,jude pepper,"[1, 1]","it was an exciting idea, and not simply because GET SMART - unquestionably the greatest series American television has ever produced or is ever likely to produce - is worthy of it's own equivalent of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. had it caught on it just might've shook up the sitcom status-quo for the better. sitcoms were so much cooler in the '60s because just about anything could happen then, from landing on a deserted island to being one of two ""monster"" families. whereas somewhere around 1975 someone decided that the sitcom should narrow it's horizons, and it seems like every ""new"" sitcom since has found itself in the same mundane day-to-day life motif and/or rut. whatever bureacrat bozo(s) made that decision may well of been put in their place, had GET SMART Mk. II had the same punch as it's ancestor.(for The Record, i'm not saying there's no validity to that day-to-day life approach. certainly there's tales to be told from that ""real life"" viewpoint. what i don't like or understand is the fact that that's all any sitcom even tries to do anymore.)and since it dealt with concerns as well as absurdities that were still going strong 25 years later, there's no reason why it shouldn't of been revivable.well, okay, there was one. i've heard more than one director say that 90% of their job is casting the right actor in the right part. the most positive thing i can say for Andy Dick is to NOT give in to the obvious dumb joke suggested by his last name. for one thing, he just doesn't fit. i suppose i could buy him as the offspring of Barney Fife, but even my flexible disbelief can't be suspended far enough to buy him as even the remotest relation to Maxwell Smart. oh yes, his limited talent was a contributing factor as well. Dick can bumble with the best of 'em, but he fails miserably to inspire anything resembling the admiration, to say nothing of affection, which Don Adams was even then commanding from a whole new audience via Nick At Nite.(the only possible excuse to be made is that Dick's brand of surrealist vulgarity was not his OFFICIAL stock-in-trade yet.)to say nothing of lack of respect for the audience. he walked unceremoneously off the series with no warning when he was offered a part on NEWSRADIO. this constituted an upward move in his career because that show was on a ""major"" network, NBC. (remember those days when the Fox Network was still regarded as little more than a notch above UHF?) and as Fate would have it, NEWSRADIO was another mostly pretty good series wherein Dick was the weakest link in the chain.his own sidekick, one Elaine Hendrix, has neither the beauty nor the charm of (still frickin' gorgeous) Barbara Feldon. Hendrix being just as miscast as Andy Dick, they have a curious sort of antimatter chemistry. they're a nice, cozy fit, for all the nothing that comes of it.surprisingly good news, though. in a twist of Fate which makes this DVD worth owning in more than the historical curiosity sense, the tried-and-true elements are as potent as ever. the redoubtable Don Adams remains in top form, and Maxwell Smart's new standing as Chief of CONTROL is something he can handle in spite of still being his old ditzy self. (it's something i've noticed about ""buffoon"" characters like Maxwell Smart, Gilligan, Inspector Clouseau, Don Quixote, Lou Costello: they always seem to have some spark of brilliance they can find if we let them work at their own pace. they're never complete, hopeless idiots for the very simple reason that they couldn't carry a story if they were.) his chemistry with Barbara ""99"" Feldon and Bernie ""Siegfried"" Kopell hadn't dissipated in the least. if only they had found more suitable leads so restricting the established characters to the periphery wouldn't feel like such a gyp.what's more, the stories make for a concerted and impressive update. consider the pricelessly titled ""Liver Let Die,"" in which KAOS engages in the then fairly new field of organ trafficking. but then, they did have Leonard Stern, the writer/producer who more than anyone else held the reins of the original series, on the payroll as ""special consultant.""(although while we're on the subject, i can't help wondering why it is described simply as ""based on the characters from the original series,"" with no mention of creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. granted, both made limited contributions and had moved on by the end of the first season. Brooks has always quite openly admitted that he took the assignment cheifly as a stepping-stone to finally getting his film THE PRODUCERS off the ground. but just the same they did plant the seed in the first place. that merits some credit, doesn't it?)the series has it's own cool new touches. for instance the CONTROL elevator has gone from an obsolete telephone booth in an empty office building to a soda vending machine at a carwash. KAOS is now run by a sublimely sinister faceless woman. (a tip of the hat, perhaps, to the nemesis of Adams' other signature character, Inspector Gadget?) and let us not forget ""Agent Zero,"" the master of disguise played by six different actors/actresses (two apiece in each of his/her three appearances).the series was obviously prompted by the successful as well as satisfying ""reunion"" tv-movie GET SMART AGAIN!! that triumphant exploit made abundantly clear that the premise still had some ""juice"" in it. the long since death of Ed ""Chief"" Platt and the death in the interim of Bob ""Larrabee"" Karvelas both had the potential to be death knells, but they managed to compensate there. it took the most masterfully audactious piece of miscasting since THE CONQUERER (starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan) to scuttle this promising series.so much of the old spirit so successfully re-established for nothing. everything else works, EVERYTHING, but one ""slip"" and the whole thing collapsed. for want of a likeable lead the appeal was lost, for want of an appeal the audience was lost, for want of an audience the series was lost, for want of a series the opportunity was lost. i'm tempted to say something about the devil in the details, but i have a sneaking suspicion that sicko Dick would take it as a compliment.this series may well be the all-time case-in-point of something i've already here in at least one review: good writing is indeed an assett, but it's nothing without decent characters. you will occasionally watch a series in spite of substandard writing because you've taken a liking to the characters, but you will never, and i do mean NEVER, fail to connect with the characters but tune in anyway for the writing. this series provides a singularly instructive contrast in the established characters which still work and their letdown son who doesn't measure up.talk about missing it byyyyyyy that much...",3,Annnnnnnd...Tolerating it!!,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,6778,"['was', 'exciting', 'idea', 'not',

So stop complaining that you expected the original series because you did not read before buying.So, 5 to 6 years after the re-union movie of ""Get Smart Again"", the group decided to come back and see if they could make a spin off series work of the original 'Get Smart'; unfortunately it didn't take off, but it's nothing that they should be ashamed of, or wish they had never done.This time around, Maxwell Smart (Don Adams) is the Chief of Control, and his son (Andy Dick) is now working for him as an inspiring agent, in what seemed to be an attempt at a passing of the torch, but Maxwell's involvement seemed to be working better then that original concept idea.Barbra Feldon is also back as 99, and a lot of familiar faces from the series make special appearances along the short 7 episode stretch. Some say the show was not funny, but I think it was good for what it was, considering it did not have 6 writers like the original had each week.Sure, some things felt missing from the show, like the laugh track, and not everything was good to watch, but for what it was, I think it's great to see the cast back having another go at what made them all celebrities 30 years or so before this.For the price, I don't know how you can really complain, and sure, it can not possibly compare to the original series, but take it for what it is, and enjoy the continuation of the Smart story.

1152262,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B001666484,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[8, 8]","The main problem in following up a classic series is that fans who love the original---and thus, make up the bulk of TV viewership---can make or break a new series. After all, the name of the game among networks is the Ratings Game---if you don't have the high numbers, then it's bye-bye.This is what seemed to have happened with ""The New Get Smart"", which never made it beyond its first seven episodes.It's too bad that TNGS didn't catch on, because it held promise. Don Adams (who looked more fit & healthy here than five years earlier in the ""Get Smart Again"" TV-movie) and Barbara Feldon reprise their roles as Max & 99. Except this time around, things have changed: Max is the chief of CONTROL (Lord help us!) and 99 is a congresswoman with budget ties to her old organization. Actually, they are more of supporting characters for the newly-promoted antics of their son, Zachary Smart (a typically nerdy but likeable Andy Dick). Of course, Zach is just as bumbling as his Dad, but in Dick's own comic stylings. As history repeats itself, he is partnered with a beautiful, skilled & intelligent blond partner, Agent 66 (99 turned upside down..get it?), played by Elaine Hendrix.Some new supporting players are included: Trudy, a ditzy secretary hired as a temp who thinks CONTROL is a talent agency (!!), a faceless femme-fatale now running the evil organization KAOS, Agent Zero (a master of disguise), and Agent 9 (who is really IS nine years old).Even some old familiar faces pop up: Dave Ketchum reprises his role as Agent 13 (hiding in a bowl of cole slaw in one episode) and even Bernie Kopell guest stars as the nefarious Siegfried, unemployed by KAOS and exacting revenge on both Max & Zach.I loved the hilarious opening credits for this series, a new variation on the old access-to-CONTROL theme, by using a car wash as cover. This series lacks the satirical zing of the old series, but it has its moments of loopy verbal comedy & goofy gadgets, 1990's style.Who knows what this series could have accomplished if it continued? They were barely scratching the surface of Zach & 66's partnership-relationship.TNGS is probably too obscure for the casual viewer, but definitely of interest to lovers of Get Smart.",4,Missed it by THAT much!,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,2222,"['main', 'problem', 'following', 'up', 'classic', 'series', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'original', '-and', 'thus', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'TV', 'viewership', '-can', 'make', 'break', 'new', 'series', 'name', 'game', 'networks', 'Ratings', 'Game', '-if', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'numbers', 'then', 'bye-bye.This', 'what', 'seemed', 'have', 'happened', 'New', 'Get', 'Smart', 'never', 'made', 'first', 'seven', 'episodes.It', 'too', 'bad', 'TNGS', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'held', 'promise', 'Don', 'Adams', 'who', 'looked', 'more', 'fit', 'healthy', 'here', 'five', 'years', 'earlier', 'Get', 'Smart', 'Again', 'TV-movie', 'Barbara', 'Feldon', 'reprise', 'roles', 'Max', '99', 'time', 'around', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'Max', 'chief', 'CONTROL', 'Lord', '99', 'congresswoman', 'budget', 'ties', 'old', 'organization', 'Actually', 'are', 'more', 'supporting', 'characters', 'newly-promoted', 'antics', 'son', 'Zachary', 'Smart', 'typically', 'nerdy', 'likeable', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'course', 'Zach', 'just', 'as', 'bumbling', 'Dad', 'Dick', 'own', 'comic', 'stylings', 'history', 'partnered', 'beautiful', 'skilled', 'intelligent', 'blond', 'partner', 'Agent', '66', '99', 'turned', 'upside', 'down..get', 'played', 'Elaine', 'Hendrix.Some', 'new', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'included', 'Trudy', 'ditzy', 'secretary', 'hired', 'temp', 'who', 'CONTROL', 'talent', 'agency', 'faceless', 'femme-fatale', 'now', 'running', 'evil', 'organization', 'KAOS', 'Agent', 'Zero', 'master', 'disguise', 'Agent', '9', 'who', 'really', 'IS', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'old', 'familiar', 'pop', 'up', 'Dave', 'Ketchum', 'role', 'Agent', '13', 'hiding', 'bowl', 'cole', 'slaw', 'one', 'episode', 'even', 'Bernie', 'Kopell', 'guest', 'stars', 'nefarious', 'Siegfried', 'unemployed', 'KAOS', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'Max', 'Zach.I', 'loved', 'hilarious', 'opening', 'credits', 'series', 'new', 'variation', 'old', 'access-to-CONTROL', 'theme', 'using', 'car', 'wash', 'cover', 'series', 'satirical', 'zing', 'old', 'series', 'moments', 'loopy', 'verbal', 'comedy', 'goofy', 'gadgets', '1990', 'style.Who', 'what', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'accomplished', 'continued', 'were', 'barely', 'scratching', 'surface', 'Zach', '66', 'partnership-relationship.TNGS', 'probably', 'too', 'obscure', 'casual', 'viewer', 'definitely', 'interest', 'lovers', 'Get', 'Smart']",Get Smart: The Complete Series

1152266,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B001666484,Twiddles42,"[50, 53]","Okay, the year was 1995.  FOX broadcasting wanted to bring in a mid-season replacement, as they are known to do.  Their decision?  Dig up ""Get Smart"".In this new series, Max is now the Chief of Control and 99, still his wife, is in Congress.  His son, Zack, is a spy and teams up with Agent 66.  (No mention is made of their other offspring, however.)7 episodes were made.Some of the benefits accorded the new series:* Agent 0 -- played by a different actor each week, you never know when 0 appears.* Most of the humor remains in the same spirit as the original* Sharply written plots* Good actingSome of the downsides to this new series:* Overtly sexual in many episodes; even the pilot has more innuendo than many of the subsequent episodes combined.* ""Casino Evil"", a great story, is a rewrite of an original series plot.  (I don't care much for rewrites, but this one did work.)* Stopped after 7 episodesHighlight episodes:* Pilot (ep 1) -- Zack and 66 investigate KAOS' attempt to steal indestructible fabric.  Ignore the innuendo, some of which does get chuckles; there's more to like than dislike in this premiere.* ""Casino Evil"" (ep 2) -- Zack and 66 infiltrate a casino operated by KAOS.* ""Goodbye Ms. Chip"" (ep 3) -- A KAOS agent kidnaps and brainwashes 66 to kill an ambassador.* Wurst Enemies (ep 6) -- An old enemy of Max returns.* ""Liver Let Die"" (ep 7) -- Zack and 66 infiltrate a KAOS hospital.  This one is my favorite of the new series; it handled the dark concepts and humor immensely well.I'm surprised this series has been scheduled for release, but am gratified.  My VHS off-air tapings are falling apart.  I do have more than a soft spot for this series, as despite being a newly commissioned series, a lot of it really gels together.  It deserved more of a proper chance than to be axed.Please check back later to get a rundown on DVD audio/video quality.  It'll probably be very good.",5,Thank you thank you thank you!!!,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,1909,"['Okay', 'year', 'was', '1995', 'FOX', 'broadcasting', 'wanted', 'bring', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'are', 'known', 'do', 'Their', 'decision', 'Dig', 'Get', 'Smart', '.In', 'new', 'series', 'Max', 'now', 'Chief', 'Control', '99', 'still', 'wife', 'Congress', 'son', 'Zack', 'spy', 'teams', 'up', 'Agent', '66', 'mention', 'made', 'other', 'offspring', 'however', '7', 'episodes', 'were', 'made.Some', 'benefits', 'accorded', 'new', 'series', '*', 'Agent', '0', 'played', 'different', 'actor', 'week', 'never', 'know', 'when', '0', '*', 'Most', 'humor', 'same', 'spirit', 'original*', 'Sharply', 'written', 'plots*', 'Good', 'actingSome', 'downsides', 'new', 'series', '*', 'Overtly', 'sexual', 'many', 'episodes', 'even', 'pilot', 'more', 'innuendo', 'many', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'combined', '*', 'Casino', 'Evil', 'great', 'story', 'rewrite', 'original', 'series', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'rewrites', 'one', 'did', 'work', '*', 'Stopped', '7', 'episodesHighlight', 'episodes', '*', 'Pilot', 'ep', '1', 'Zack', '66', 'investigate', 'KAOS', 'attempt', 'steal', 'indestructible', 'fabric', 'innuendo', 'get', 'chuckles', 'more', 'like', 'dislike', 'premiere', '*', 'Casino', 'Evil', 'ep', '2', 'Zack', '66', 'infiltrate', 'casino', 'operated', 'KAOS', '*', 'Goodbye', 'Ms.', 'Chip', 'ep', '3', 'KAOS', 'agent', 'kidnaps', 'brainwashes', '66', 'kill', 'ambassador', 'Wurst', 'Enemies', 'ep', '6', 'old', 'enemy', 'Max', 'returns', '*', 'Liver', 'Let', 'Die', 'ep', '7', 'Zack', '66', 'infiltrate', 'KAOS', 'hospital', 'one', 'favorite', 'new', 'series', 'handled', 'dark', 'concepts', 'humor', 'immensely', 'well.I', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'series', 'been', 'scheduled', 'release', 'am', 'gratified', 'VHS', 'off-air', 'tapings', 'are', 'falling', 'apart', 'do', 'have', 'more', 'soft', 'spot', 'series', 'being', 'newly', 'commissioned', 'series', 'lot', 'really', 'together', 'deserved', 'more', 'proper', 'chance', 'be', 'axed.Please', 'check', 'back', 'later', 'get', 'rundown', 'DVD', 'audio/video', 'quality', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'very', 'good']",Get Smart: The Complete Series
