Castle is one of the best written and acted and directed series I have seen.  It is a complete joy to watch.  And for Firefly/Serenity fans, this show is a must since Nathan Fillion is basically acting his Mel character but on Earth, which is amazing to watch!This series continues to get better and better, and the end of season 4 finally delivers the completion to the biggest story arc in the entire series-- don't miss it!",5,Castle just gets better and better!,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,615,"['recommend', 'watching', 'series', 'order', 'starting', 'episode', '1', 'order', 't', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'giant', 'story', 'arcs', 'character', 'development', 'humor', 'previous', 'show', 'scenarios', 'Castle', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'complete', 'joy', 'watch', 'Firefly/Serenity', 'fans', 'show', 'must', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'basically', 'acting', 'Mel', 'character', 'Earth', 'amazing', 'watch', 'series', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'end', 'season', '4', 'finally', 'completion', 'biggest', 'story', 'arc', 'entire', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss']",Castle: Season 4

1438733,A3J1L5HC0RMCDX,B0053O89KG,"Anonymous45 ""michael cifelli""","[0, 1]","In one review, the writer compared this to Moonlighting.....where Bruce Willis got his start...I thought it was a good comparison. Although, Bruce Wilis is much funnier in my opinion...I did not watch this show from the start. I was upset they took off ""Lie to Me"" with Tim Roth.  I thought they kept the Mentalist on, which is way to silly compared to Lie to Me.  Then when castle came on, it just seemed to be another mentalist type show. And in many ways it is. No castle cant read minds or people.  But the two shows have many of the same attributes.  Man and a Woman, doing a job, same job i might add, and sexual tension. I have to say, i have been catching up, and i am almost up to date. I now am hooked on this show. It drives me nuts because i now have to make time for yet another show....What i do love about the show is Becket (the woman detective).  She is what really got me to stay tuned in. I grew to appreciate Castle, but I prefer the guy from the Mentalist. There are more layers to his character then what they allow Castle to have.  They need to do a little better with the writing and develop more layers to the characters. And If they do what they did with Bones?  I will stop watching it.  It is in its 5th season. Going into the 6th season or year next season. It's time to either put these two together or let it go. And if they do put them together, we should not have to watch them break up after four episodes like they did in ""House"", when House dated Cuddy.....I would like them to do is break from the traditional tv themes....No reason to make us wait, then put them together, then break them up shortly after.  I am just hoping they come up with some more raw material to work with, develope the characters a bit more.  I have no problem with them getting the two together, meaning castle and Becket.  But do it already. Let the audience have some fun. The woman seem to love Castle, the men have to love his partner...she is beautiful, and they are playing her down...I like her even more than the lead woman detective on the Mentalist... I think Castle is fun to watch, and yes, the story line, or theme is something we have seen many times especially in the mentalist.....but there is enough difference in the writing , acting, and the actors themselves, that make this show worth watching.  It's good fun, and I would say its a must see. I gave it 4 stars, even though part of me wants to give it 5 stars especially with Becket. But they need to do more with the story lines. And move their relationship along a little faster now. With tv executives ripping shows off the air just when we fall in love with them, they don't have as much time as they use to. They need to move things along a little faster.  If they do, i would then give it 5 stars...I say it's a must see....I do enjoy it.....",4,I am Not in Love With it But Im Getting There...,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,2832,"['one', 'review', 'writer', 'compared', 'Moonlighting', '..where', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'got', 'start', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'comparison', 'Bruce', 'Wilis', 'much', 'funnier', 'opinion', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'show', 'start', 'was', 'upset', 'took', 'off', 'Lie', 'Me', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'thought', 'kept', 'Mentalist', 'way', 'silly', 'compared', 'Lie', 'Me', 'Then', 'when', 'castle', 'came', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'mentalist', 'type', 'show', 'many', 'ways', 'castle', 'cant', 'read', 'minds', 'people', 'two', 'shows', 'have', 'many', 'same', 'attributes', 'Man', 'Woman', 'doing', 'job', 'same', 'job', 'i', 'might', 'add', 'sexual', 'tension', 'have', 'say', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'catching', 'up', 'i', 'am', 'almost', 'date', 'now', 'am', 'hooked', 'show', 'i', 'now', 'have', 'make', 'time', 'yet', 'show', '.What', 'do', 'love', 'show', 'Becket', 'woman', 'detective', 'what', 'really', 'got', 'stay', 'tuned', 'grew', 'appreciate', 'Castle', 'prefer', 'guy', 'Mentalist', 'are', 'more', 'layers', 'character', 'then', 'what', 'allow', 'Castle', 'have', 'need', 'do', 'little', 'better', 'writing', 'develop', 'more', 'layers', 'characters', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'Bones', 'will', 'stop', 'watching', '5th', 'season', 'Going', '6th', 'season', 'year', 'season', 'time', 'put', 'two', 'together', 'let', 'go', 'do', 'put', 'together', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'watch', 'break', 'up', 'four', 'episodes', 'did', 'House', 'when', 'House', 'dated', 'Cuddy', '..I', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'break', 'traditional', 'tv', 'themes', '.No', 'reason', 'make', 'wait', 'then', 'put', 'together', 'then', 'break', 'up', 'shortly', 'am', 'just', 'hoping', 'come', 'up', 'more', 'raw', 'material', 'work', 'develope', 'characters', 'bit', 'more', 'have', 'problem', 'getting', 'two', 'together', 'meaning', 'castle', 'Becket', 'do', 'already', 'Let', 'audience', 'have', 'fun', 'woman', 'seem', 'love', 'Castle', 'men', 'have', 'love', 'partner', 'beautiful', 'are', 'playing', 'down', 'like', 'even', 'more', 'lead', 'woman', 'detective', 'Mentalist', 'think', 'Castle', 'fun', 'watch', 'yes', 'story', 'line', 'theme', 'something', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'especially', 'mentalist', '..but', 'enough', 'difference', 'writing', 'acting', 'actors', 'make', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', 'good', 'fun', 'would', 'say', 'must', 'see', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'even', 'part', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'especially', 'Becket', 'need', 'do', 'more', 'story', 'lines', 'move', 'relationship', 'little', 'faster', 'now', 'tv', 'executives', 'ripping', 'shows', 'air', 'just', 'when', 'fall', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'use', 'need', 'move', 'things', 'little', 'faster', 'do', 'i', 'would', 'then', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'say', 'must', 'see', 'do', 'enjoy', '..']",Castle: Season 4

1438744,A2DONKOXI3JU6A,B0053O89KG,Ben Moore,"[0, 0]","This is a great crime dramady featuring Nathan Fillion who we all know from Firefly! If you're old enough to remember, I have to liken Castle to a blend of &#34;Moon Lighting&#34;, &#34;Columbo&#34;, and &#34;Murder She Wrote&#34;.  I am now officially in mourning however as we're flying through the seasons.  My wife and I tend to watch a few episodes a day and before we know it, we'll be caught up and stuck waiting a week for each new episode!  ACK!!!!The 30 second gist of the show is that Fillion is a crime writer who gets connected with an attractive detective and manages to convince the mayor (who Castle is friends with) that he should have unrestricted access to follow her around for inspiration. He's also a huge asset to the NYPD with his understanding of criminal behavior etc. Fillion is great and there is lots of comic relief surrounding the central murder plot so it's not a real downer to watch. Season four continues to refine the chemistry between Beckett and Castle and their relationship is always in flux with lots of tension and humor.  For the most part, you can jump around between episodes and not watch them in order.  It seems that there are usually 4 or 5 episodes in each season that move the greater story arc plot along.  The other shows, while equally fantastic, focus elusively on the murder of the day and not Becket or Castle's past.As of the time of this writing, they are into Season 6. We just started watching about a month ago, ripped through season 1,2, & 3 and are now wrapping up 4. Owning them on Amazon is the way to go, commercial free and easy to watch on pretty much any internet connected device, not to mention binge watching multiple episodes back to back makes for nice unwind time after the kids are fast asleep!

The problem this season is it became too tongue and cheek comedy and the cases have become way too formulaic.  Add to that everyone confesses and no one wants their lawyer.  The show used to walk the fine line between drama and comedy and now it's just very light hearted fun with no real drama or story.I'm going to keep my subscription for this show going this season, but if it doesn't get better I think I'm done with the show.  Already most of the shows this season left my fianc&eacute;e and I feeling let down.  It's sad since we were always psyched about watching the new episodes the minute they aired.  Now we just kinda wait until we have nothing to do.  I want the drama back.  I want the dark. I miss the wit. And I want the laugh out loud comedy moments that the show used to have in spades.

It has fallen so deeply into cop show cliche that I can barely stand it. This will be my last purchase of a Castle season as it has enough of an ending to finish my collection. I won't be a continuing viewer. I don't care about this pair anymore.What happened? Why did it go from a light, funny, romantic mystery series to just another dark, gritty, urban cop show? Probably because the writers couldn't resist throwing in the most overused plot device of tv cop show catalogs, the psycho/drug gang killer who has targeted one cop,and/or their family, leaving the main character obsessed with revenge and risking their life and career to track down the killer, SO BORING. I had hoped after the bombing of Kate's apartment, a plot lifted from Remington Steele, that they would wind up that storyline and get back to creatively solving murders with humor and charm, but no. The writers had to damage and kill off other close friends of Kate's and take a shot at Kate, oh yes, and they had to try a comic book spinoff to darken it further. And the new captain? Oh well what else, a crusty curmudgeon. The show wrote in a young more attractive one, but still a standard cop show character. Every season but this one ended with Kate in danger and Castle walking away. Once again, SO BORING!What made this series interesting to me was that it had a hopeful pair of romantically attracted characters with plenty of spark and humor. It was romantic and charming, with unusual if not funny cases. Now it has a pair of dull, damaged, everyday, gritty cops, who work realistic city street murders and gang murders without much mystery. Kate is obsessed with her mother's killer even if she dies searching for the psychos who have drawn a target on her. Kate and Castle have become just another set of common tv forensic detective characters with predictable dark emotional edges who might, or might not, work out their differences to live/marry/or work together before Kate finds out the truth, probably as she dies in Castle's arms, or is pushed out of the way of the bullet by a mortally wounded Castle as he protects her. Either way, so predictible. So dull.The cases they work now while acting out this plot are average murders not society or locked room mysteries. Even the sets are dark and classless. What happened to all the upper crust settings, writer cameos, celebrity cameos, glamour, sparkle, wit, quirky connections,and party murders that connected the Castle character to the mysteries? Where's the champagne? Now it's only morning coffee and dull faces. They might as well have married them off in the first season. Who done it? Who cares?This show attracted viewers to a fantasy, not a reality type cop series. I've had enough with the rain, the tears, the dark dirty sets, the obsession, and the angst. Thats' not what started me watching this show. This viewer is turning away. Series four finishes my collection with their passion satisfied giving me an acceptable end to it. When I watch Castle now I will go back the early episodes to enjoy a light romantic mystery or dig out my old copies of Remington Steele or MacMillan and Wife.",2,So changed even passion can't save it,1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,3250,"['used', 'so', 'love', 'show', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'anywhere', 'Monday', 'nights', 'home', 'Castle', 'Not', 'anymore', 'fallen', 'so', 'deeply', 'cop', 'show', 'cliche', 'can', 'barely', 'stand', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'purchase', 'Castle', 'season', 'enough', 'ending', 'finish', 'collection', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'continuing', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'pair', 'happened', 'Why', 'did', 'go', 'light', 'funny', 'romantic', 'mystery', 'series', 'just', 'dark', 'gritty', 'urban', 'cop', 'show', 'Probably', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'throwing', 'most', 'overused', 'plot', 'device', 'tv', 'cop', 'show', 'catalogs', 'psycho/drug', 'gang', 'killer', 'who', 'targeted', 'one', 'cop', 'and/or', 'family', 'leaving', 'main', 'character', 'obsessed', 'revenge', 'risking', 'life', 'career', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'SO', 'BORING', 'had', 'hoped', 'bombing', 'Kate', 'apartment', 'plot', 'lifted', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'storyline', 'get', 'back', 'creatively', 'solving', 'murders', 'humor', 'charm', 'writers', 'had', 'damage', 'kill', 'off', 'other', 'close', 'friends', 'Kate', 'take', 'shot', 'Kate', 'oh', 'yes', 'had', 'try', 'comic', 'book', 'spinoff', 'darken', 'further', 'new', 'captain', 'Oh', 'well', 'what', 'else', 'crusty', 'curmudgeon', 'show', 'wrote', 'young', 'more', 'attractive', 'one', 'still', 'standard', 'cop', 'show', 'character', 'season', 'one', 'ended', 'Kate', 'danger', 'Castle', 'walking', 'away', 'Once', 'again', 'BORING', 'What', 'made', 'series', 'interesting', 'was', 'had', 'hopeful', 'pair', 'romantically', 'attracted', 'characters', 'plenty', 'spark', 'humor', 'was', 'romantic', 'charming', 'unusual', 'not', 'funny', 'cases', 'Now', 'pair', 'dull', 'damaged', 'everyday', 'gritty', 'cops', 'who', 'work', 'realistic', 'city', 'street', 'murders', 'gang', 'murders', 'much', 'mystery', 'Kate', 'obsessed', 'mother', 'killer', 'even', 'searching', 'psychos', 'who', 'have', 'drawn', 'target', 'Kate', 'Castle', 'have', 'become', 'just', 'set', 'common', 'tv', 'forensic', 'detective', 'characters', 'predictable', 'dark', 'emotional', 'edges', 'who', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'differences', 'live/marry/or', 'work', 'together', 'Kate', 'out', 'truth', 'probably', 'Castle', 'arms', 'pushed', 'way', 'bullet', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'Castle', 'way', 'so', 'predictible', 'dull.The', 'cases', 'work', 'now', 'acting', 'out', 'plot', 'are', 'average', 'murders', 'not', 'society', 'locked', 'room', 'mysteries', 'Even', 'sets', 'are', 'dark', 'classless', 'What', 'happened', 'upper', 'crust', 'settings', 'writer', 'cameos', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'glamour', 'sparkle', 'wit', 'quirky', 'connections', 'party', 'murders', 'connected', 'Castle', 'character', 'mysteries', 'Where', 'champagne', 'Now', 'only', 'morning', 'coffee', 'dull', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'married', 'off', 'first', 'season', 'Who', 'done', 'Who', 'show', 'attracted', 'viewers', 'fantasy', 'not', 'reality', 'type', 'cop', 'series', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'rain', 'tears', 'dark', 'dirty', 'sets', 'obsession', 'angst', 'Thats', 'not', 'what', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'viewer', 'turning', 'away', 'Series', 'four', 'finishes', 'collection', 'passion', 'satisfied', 'giving', 'acceptable', 'end', 'When', 'watch', 'Castle', 'now', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'early', 'episodes', 'enjoy', 'light', 'romantic', 'mystery', 'dig', 'out', 'old', 'copies', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'MacMillan', 'Wife']",Castle: Season 4

The bank job episode was another one that may have seemed good on paper, but the story's nothing new, and the characters are stretching their roles a bit beyond belief.I think several episodes had HUGE potential, but fell just a bit short.

1438796,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0053O89KG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[13, 15]","NYPD Homicide Detective Kate Beckett is damaged goods. She carries more baggage than Samsonite. It's part and parcel of why she fascinates us. The brutal murder of her mother had long ago determined the trajectory of her life. And, over the years, that murder had also impacted CASTLE's overarching narrative thrust. I won't lie, Season 4's episode finale does address that long-running theme, sort of, but it's not like Beckett achieves any real traction with regards to resolving this. Instead, as we tune in, we end up settling for the show's other draws. Like, say, the consistently droll Ryan-Esposito bromance. The sweet father-daughter interactions between Castle and Alexis. The mystery-of-the-week as viewed thru the prism of Castle's outside-the-box perspective. Then there are Castle's off-the-wall remarks and Beckett's bemused reactions. And, of course, that simmer between them (or as the hardcore crowds have annoyingly anointed them: ""Caskett""). Fans of that last bit should have something to talk about in this season.I wonder if them CASTLE showrunners took a peek over at what's gone down in BONES and so were galvanized into stepping their game up.In tossing in my two cents regarding prior seasons, I'd praised the hell out of the cast and their chemistry and the tone of the show. So, today, I'll just say that the acting is still aces and I still dig the (mostly) light tone. If there's one distressing element in Season 4, it's that several episodes got too heavyhanded with the soap opera aspect, what with Castle's having found out that Beckett had feigned unconsciousness when Castle told her he loved her back when she got all shot up by that sniper. I got a little fed up with Castle's moping. He seems to not have put enough weight on that Beckett was going thru her own sh-- at the time. So, yeah, the romantic thread became a bit too Mexican telenovela for me. But she's keeping a secret, and he's keeping a massive secret. Because, at this stage, Rick Castle is closer to the truth behind the conspiracy than Beckett is.There's a shift in group dynamics with the advent of the tough-as-nails Captain Victoria ""Iron"" Gates as the new head of Precinct 12. She takes an instant dislike to Castle, which is neat for ongoing character conflict. You'd think her stance against him would soften as the season went on... but nuh-uh. Meanwhile, Alexis begins interning with Lanie, the police medical examiner, except that this may be too close for comfort for her concerned dad. There's also some guff about Alexis agonizing over which college to attend. Another plot thread amusingly tracks Ryan's impending nuptials. A slice of trivia: In a very cool life-imitates-art moment, Seamus Dever - who plays Detective Ryan - married his real-life wife, Juliana, again, on camera (Juliana plays Ryan's fiancee on the show).It's another fine season, and full of episodes that mostly fall in the high watchability bracket. But I have my favorites:- ""Heroes & Villains"" - Beckett and Castle investigate an alley murder in which the perpetrator may be the comic book superhero, Lone Vengeance. Except that there are several suspects running around wearing the Lone Vengeance costume. Plenty of nods to us comic book geeks.- ""Kick the Ballistics"" - This ep focuses on Detective Ryan as his old service weapon - the one that was taken by the serial killer, 3XK, in last season - resurfaces in a homicide.- ""Demons"" - It's Halloween, as Beckett and Castle look into the slaying of a ghost hunter in a haunted house, with Castle theorizing that dark supernatural forces may be at play. But Beckett, being Beckett, scoffs at Castle's notion of a murderous ghost (or, as Castle calls it, ""Apparition American""). Heh.- ""Cops and Robbers"" - Castle and his mom are in a bank that gets taken over by four bank robbers dressed up in doctor's scrubs. This pretzely (because it's twisty) episode starts out as a hostage-taking bank heist, but it spins off into something else altogether.- ""Kill Shot"" - As a world-class sniper with a mad-on stalks New York, a traumatized Beckett tries to overcome her post-traumatic stress disorder. Stana Katic turns in a stunning, heartbreaking performance. And for fans of Javi Esposito, your boy falls into the spotlight.- ""Cuffed"" - As if Beckett and Castle being cuffed together and locked in a room isn't promising enough, there's also a killer tiger on the rampage. Time to sit back and soak in the excellent banter and rampant sexual innuendo.- ""The Blue Butterfly"" - This is the awesomely awesome 1940s film noir episode. 'Nuff said (except that it's awesome).- ""Pandora"" & ""Linchpin"" - Okay, the cliffhanger ending to ""Pandora"" is a bit ridiculous, but I still like these two eps for digging into Castle's backstory. In this two-parter, Castle and Beckett become embroiled in a deadly international conspiracy and also get pretty much pushed around by the CIA. The gorgeous-as-ever Jennifer Beals guest-stars as CIA operative Sophia Conrad, with whom Castle shares a heated past (Castle and Sophia, sitting on a tree...). Hey, is that Beckett getting all jealous?- ""Headhunters"" - A disillusioned Castle decides to partner up with the unhinged, rule-breaking Sgt. Slaughter (Adam Baldwin) on a severed heads case.- ""Undead Again"" - Zombie episode. There's really nothing more to say.- ""Always"" - In this taut, game-changing season finale, are we witnessing the end of a steadfast bromance? Also, the return of Beckett's sniper causes a serious rift between Beckett and Castle.",4,"Beckett and Castle, sitting on a tree... not doing jack!!",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,5523,"['NYPD',

1438800,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0053O89KG,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[14, 20]","The fourth season finale of CASTLE is approaching next week. It's been a fun season overall, but the last five or six episodes have been about the relationship between Castle and Beckett and it reaching a critical mass over whether or not they will remain platonic or become romantic.I know that this show is hoping to avoid the pitfalls of MOONLIGHTING and THE X-FILES becoming boring as the romantic/sexual tension between the two leads potentially disappears once they become romantically involved, but ENOUGH ALREADY. Too much of this season has been focusing on ""Will they or won't they"" being the arc between these two characters and it needs resolution. Hopefully, the season finale will finally resolve this, because if it continues to tease with the possibility of hot monkey love between Castle and Beckett, although I love this show, it's going to actually do more harm if it just drags it out and people, like myself, are going to start tuning out.Also, watching episodes of FIREFLY and DRIVE and the film SERENITY makes me long for the days when Nathan Fillion was a certified bad-a$$, so, I'm hoping that the following seasons actually make way for Castle to become more action-y. Perhaps having a romantic relationship with Beckett can cause that to come to greater fruition. She can train him how to respond to more physical demands. It wouldn't change the character terribly, or for the worse, because Fillion is a great romantic and comedic foil. I also know that this is potentially a problematic idea since Castle's greatest weapon is his mind, but that hasn't ever stopped Sherlock Holmes.I'm not a contrarian and I do love this show, but this arc is becoming too frustrating. It's too ratings-centric with little regard for what fans really want to see. If it works between Castle and Beckett and that actually ends up helping the show and its narrative, great! If it works for them, and it hurts the show, they can at least say that they tried.Personally, I'm rooting for a relationship.",4,"Quit Dragging Out The ""Will They or Won't They""!",1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,2010,"['fourth', 'season', 'finale', 'CASTLE', 'approaching', 'next', 'week', 'been', 'fun', 'season', 'overall', 'last', 'five', 'six', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'relationship', 'Castle', 'Beckett', 'reaching', 'critical', 'mass', 'not', 'will', 'remain', 'platonic', 'become', 'romantic.I', 'know', 'show', 'hoping', 'avoid', 'pitfalls', 'MOONLIGHTING', 'THE', 'X-FILES', 'becoming', 'boring', 'romantic/sexual', 'tension', 'two', 'leads', 'potentially', 'once', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'ENOUGH', 'ALREADY', 'Too', 'much', 'season', 'been', 'focusing', 'Will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'being', 'arc', 'two', 'characters', 'resolution', 'Hopefully', 'season', 'finale', 'will', 'finally', 'resolve', 'tease', 'possibility', 'hot', 'monkey', 'love', 'Castle', 'Beckett', 'love', 'show', 'going', 'actually', 'do', 'more', 'harm', 'just', 'drags', 'out', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'start', 'tuning', 'out.Also', 'watching', 'episodes', 'FIREFLY', 'DRIVE', 'film', 'SERENITY', 'long', 'days', 'when', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'was', 'certified', 'bad-a', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'following', 'seasons', 'actually', 'make', 'way', 'Castle', 'become', 'more', 'action-y', 'Perhaps', 'having', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Beckett', 'can', 'cause', 'come', 'greater', 'fruition', 'can', 'train', 'how', 'respond', 'more', 'physical', 'demands', 'would', ""n't"", 'change', 'character', 'terribly', 'worse', 'Fillion', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedic', 'foil', 'also', 'know', 'potentially', 'problematic', 'idea', 'Castle', 'greatest', 'weapon', 'mind', ""n't"", 'ever', 'stopped', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'contrarian', 'do', 'love', 'show', 'arc', 'becoming', 'too', 'frustrating', 'too', 'ratings-centric', 'little', 'regard', 'what', 'fans', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Castle', 'Beckett', 'actually', 'up', 'helping', 'show', 'narrative', 'great', 'show', 'can', 'least', 'say', 'tried.Personally', ""'m"", 'rooting', 'relationship']",Castle: Season 4

1438821,A10872FHIJAKKD,B0053O89KG,Just Bill,"[9, 24]","My wife and I were into Castle from Season 1, Episode 1. And that's mostly because we're fans of Nathan Fillion. In our eyes, the man can do no wrong.Castle was an instant hit with us. The chemistry between all the characters was amazing. And we hadn't seen magic between two characters like we did with Castle and Beckett ever. She was hot. He was witty. Castle was our favorite show on TV.Then came Season Four and it all went to the dumpster.I can't even begin to explain all of the things wrong with Season Four. It was a train wreck from the very first episode -- a massive let down that set the stage for everything else to follow.Everything we loved about Castle from Seasons 1-3 is missing in Season Four. A partial list:1. Beckett's not the same person. Instead of being flirtatious and hot, she dressed like a dowdy librarian, was withdrawn and cranky, and rarely paired with Castle on cases. Stana Katic is, easily, one of the hottest women on TV. But her looks and personality were hidden throughout Season Four. Beckett wasn't Beckett in Season Four.2. Castle was morose, tense, and ill at ease in Season Four. He rarely wrote, talked about writing, had fun with Beckett, or even was particularly playful with his daughter and mother. Castle wasn't Castle in Season Four.3. The special writers pokers games with Castle and other giants of the literary world were absent. Not a single game took place. The writers weren't the writers in Season Four.4. The camaraderie between Castle, Beckett, Ryan and Esposito is absent in Season Four. The first three seasons were hilarious, especially in seasons between Ryan and Esposito. Don't look for the fun in Season Four. It's not there. Ryan and Esposito were not Ryan and Esposito in Season Four.5. The new precinct captain is a tool. She's angry, terse, and brutal. Thankfully, her role was minimal. She was barely there. And, when she was, she wasn't likeable. We definitely missed Captain Roy Montgomery. So the precinct captain wasn't the precinct captain in Season Four.6. The near misses between Castle and Beckett reached new heights of aggravation. The writers/producers built up a tremendous relationship between them over the first three years. After the cliff hanger of Season Three, everyone had high hopes for the start of Season Four. Tragically, the potential relationship died at the end of Season Three. It was over and done within the first 15 minutes of Season Four. After the first episode, everything fell to crap and Beckett and Castle were estranged from the first episode onward. Every time they nearly spoke honestly to one another, they were interrupted by Ryan or Esposito or a phone call or something. Over and over again. It got so bad -- and so frequent -- that we felt manipulated. We knew we were being conned, strung along, by the writers. So many times we said to ourselves, ""This is it. We're done."" So the romance wasn't the romance in Season Four.7. The writers introduced a character -- Michael Dorn -- as a counselor/psychologist, a person in whom Beckett could confide. Dorn's character was a way for the writers to trip over themselves with exposition, occasionally letting the audience in on secrets in Beckett's life. However, this character was never fully realized. He appeared only, maybe three times in Season Four. Dorn was wasted. So important characters were not important characters in Season Four.8. The first three seasons felt like the writers treated the audience with respect (with the exception of increasingly implausible near misses between Castle and Beckett). We didn't feel used, cheated, or talked down to. Season Four was exactly the opposite. We felt like we did when we watched the last few episodes of the TV show LOST, especially the series finale. The last episode of LOST surely qualifies as one of the worst in TV history. The writers got lazy and didn't give a rat's keister about the audience. That's how Season Four of Castle felt. The writers squandered characters we grew to love. They wasted the talents of gifted actors. And they wasted our time as members of the audience. So the writing was not the writing in Season Four.9. The stories lacked snap. The cases these character investigated were B-grade compared to the first three seasons. They just weren't interesting, compelling, or worth staying up to watch. So the stories weren't the stories in Season Four.10. The season finale didn't make up for an entire season of garbage that came before it. It was too little, too late. And absolutely unrealistic. It was phoney. It should have been the first episode of Season Four, not the last. (Plus, the writers lost our trust with the abysmal Season Four opener. We expected big things in Season Four, at least a relationship between Castle and Beckett. So we don't have high hopes for Season Five. We've been burned before.Season Four of Castle was one of the biggest letdowns we've ever experienced in a TV show. It was sloppy and contrived and unrealistic and a sad waste of time.We may buy Season Four when it's released on DVD. But we probably won't. None of the episodes are worth watching again. They were painful enough the first time.Season Five has 2-3 episodes to redeem itself, to make amends for the sins of Season Four. After that, we're tuning out and spending our time elsewhere. So we hope the writers found their mojo again -- or put some effort into their writing. Castle is too good to screw up.",2,"The Worst Season Of Castle -- Lazy, Sloppy Writing, Boring Cases, No Magic",1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,5452,"['wife', 'were', 'Castle', 'Season', '1', 'Episode',

It even has the same basic weight as Bones but the actors are all so good that it works brilliantly. (I didn't care for the pilot much.

Not least, the supporting cast is remarkably and uniformly great. For characters that speak almost entirely in exposition, the detectives played by Seamus Dever and Jon Huertas are as engaging as the leads. And the leads have the chemistry required to make it all run.One slight side warning that the writing is fantastic up to third season but something changed in fourth, including writing, balance, costumes and music cues, and some of us are less enchanted with season four and up.

I now own seasons 1-4 and season 5 is on order.  I ordered season 1 having never seen an episode.  I was persuaded to order season 1 by good word of mouth about it and my fondness for Firefly and Serenity, which also starred Nathan Fillion.  I fell in love with the show almost immediately.  As I have watched the show through 4 seasons it has consistently offered delicious fun.  The cast are excellent, especially Stana Katic as Detective Kate Beckett and Nathan Fillion in the title role as Richard Castle.  I have to admit that, much like the Richard Castle character, I have become smitten by the Detective Kate Beckett character.  And I totally empathize and relate to what Castle goes through as he tries doggedly to win her heart.  And I completely understand that she is more than worth all the setbacks he has had to endure in that pursuit. I know I am being manipulated into it but, almost despite myself, I find I am very much rooting for Castle and Beckett to make each other happy.  The quality of the character development here is outstanding and Katic and Fillion make us (or at least me) care deeply about their characters.  The supporting cast is very good too.  Castle has something for almost everyone.  There is action, mystery, plot twists, witty dialog, lots of romance, and no small amount of humor.

1438856,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B0053O89KG,M. Hill,"[1, 1]","First, let me clearly state that Castle is a television show I enjoy. I find it to be an entertaining dramadey with a talented and appealing cast. In contrast to many police procedurals, this is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously. Yes, accuracy and even continuity are frequently completely ignored, but the show remains a welcome escape. The writing usually includes interesting plot twists and amusing banter. And unlike many shows of this type the gore is kept to a tolerable minimum. The goal is to amuse with words rather than gross-out with blood and guts.For some reason the creators decided to radically change the tone of the show during season four going from light to dark. It reminded me of the comedy show Frasier when in season 6 he lost his job and the fun departed along with his radio show. Big mistake which was quickly rectified in season 7. Let's hope that Castle's upcoming season returns us to the strength of the show -- a light romantic dramadey with killer chemistry between the leads. The cast is blameless. They performed as well as possible given depressing material.No way around the fact that this was a disappointing season but the last episode was stellar. Well-constructed and genuinely romantic and passionate, the culmination of four years of longing, made all the more significant because of the lack-luster season.But, whether I think this season failed to live up to the previous three, or whether I think the writing drained the fun and tension from the interaction between Beckett and Castle, or whether I think the lighting and wardrobe guys hate some of the cast members, or whether I think whomever came up with the Elvis-themed episode should never be allowed to make another creative decision are all discussions of interest only to the most serious fans of the program, people who probably pre-ordered this DVD set and won't be reading reviews to decide whether to part with their hard-earned money and purchase the discs. So, my star rating will focus on the DVD set and its extras rather than my opinion of the show itself.The set is not high definition and is also not available in Blu-ray format but the quality is still good, and mirrors the prior seasons' sets. Sound is Dolby Digital 5.1. The DVDs look and sound good and I encountered no problem playing the discs. And, although initially excited to find significantly more bonus material included in Season four's set of five discs I was disappointed with some of the inclusions.The deleted scenes are always of interest, and one of the eight actually helped explain some dialog in the final episode - seeing the deleted scene provided greater clarity. Time constraints force these cuts and it is beneficial that DVD sets allow us the opportunity to view these scenes.The four minute blooper reel is easily the best of the four seasons - good enough that I found myself watching it a few times in a row. For those offended by such things, note that a number of scenes contained a bleeped-out profanity or two.Also included in the bonus material is a sixteen minute feature on the making of a special effects scene of Beckett's car going into the river from this season's two-part story. It was fascinating to watch from the creation of the storyboards, drawn scene by scene, down to the computer generated animation that created the actual visual of the car sinking. It was also interesting to see the two stunt doubles for the show's leads -- spooky how similar they looked to the actual actors.Three episodes featured commentary - each with a different group of cast and crew. The result was mixed but some interesting details were revealed during the discussions. I've heard better commentaries, and worse. Fillion (Castle) and Katic (Beckett) were featured on only one of the three episodes selected for commentary -- probably the worst of the bunch made so because the showrunner and his writer/wife (paired with them) seemed uncomfortable. The commentary on the Blue Butterfly episode was the best.There is a feature on the Bowman father and son directing team which was interesting but a little too long -- my attention drifted. But the worst offender was the Fillion and Friends Castle Goes Radio. The title was blatantly misleading. I expected to see the Castle cast recreating a radio show and instead found a program unrelated to the show at all.The radio show is a bare bones production regularly performed by a troupe of actors designed to simulate a radio program performed in front of a live audience.  Nathan Fillion and Molly Quinn appeared as guests and were only on screen briefly. The feature had nothing to do with Castle. The pseudo radio show was mildly amusing and the actors seemed to be having a great time but the result was largely mediocre.Watching this was for me a waste of time and as a fan of the television series I felt manipulated into viewing it thinking it was Castle related. Bonus material needs to be relevant to the actual show -- that is what the purchaser is paying for - not just anything featuring some of the actors. If we are going that route soon these sets will include voice-over commercials for automobiles and beer.Over-all the set will please avid Castle fans, but if you haven't watched seasons one through three (at least most of three) do it -- don't judge the series by season four.Rating -- four and a half stars (half a star deduction for unrelated bonus material) rounded up to five stars.",5,Castle

It's a great combination of comedy, action, suspense & crime drama with a cool supporting cast and smart writing (first couple of seasons, at least).The 4th season continues with the &#34;will they / won't they?&#34; back & forth of author Castle and detective Beckett, but it's done well, given a series like this can't keep it up forever because it'll get stale.

Takes an inordinate amount of time and manipulation to get to the next show you want to watch.

So, I have three seasons of Castle that I can watch with no problem and one season, four, that is defective.  Thanks Amazon. Perhaps you should review and revise your policy on returning defective DVD's, at lease on an individual basis. Guess where I won't be buying season five or anything else from Amazon.Just received contact from Amazon's service representative.  They are accepting my return of this item and will be sending me a new copy.

Not only is the opening of that season dealt with extremely well, but things go along with increasingly demanding cases that almost appear that Castle might have written them himself!  There are a wealth of good episodes, but the standoout for me was &#34;The Blue Butterfly&#34; &#8212; a nod to the film noir of the 1930's and 1940's.  We get to see Castle and Beckett and Alexis in period costumes as they play multiple characters retelling a story revolving around love, deception and priceless jewelry.This may be my favorite story played out so far, as it takes clever manipulation to make it work effectively &#8212; which it does very well inbdeed!  There are several times in the Four Seasons that certain plot lines interweave with surprising results.  It comes down to writing and firm direction, never leaving the path that the series started on.  I do not believe in &#34;spoiler alerts&#34;, or the spoiling of anything so cleverly put together, so you'll have to do what I did: Rush out and buy some!

Regrettably, problems that started to become evident halfway through season three rained down on the series all throughout season four.  By the end of the first episode, it was clear that the engine was beginning to sputter.In brief, here were just a few of ""Castle's"" season four misses:1. Castle's ""big confession"" from the season three finale - telling Beckett he loved her as she lay near death, and the question of whether she heard or remembered it.  As the season progressed, the endless ""did she or didn't she"" became an insult to the viewer.  Why? Because it required the viewer to believe that Beckett was a complete idiot.  The idea that she wasn't already aware of Castle's feelings for her - confession or no confession - was utterly ridiculous.2. Captain Victoria Gates.  Just a bad character all the way around.  A totally unlikeable and one-dimensional caricature of a tyrannical female boss with an enormous chip on her shoulder.  A complete waste of a talented actress like Penny Johnson.3. Castle's wardrobe.  The dashing and debonair mystery writer began adding pounds and dressing like a hobo.  Definitely not okay for a romantic leading man who's pursuing a stunner like Stana Katic.  In real life, maybe.  On television?  Never.4. Supporting cast became annoying and dull.  Alexis' endless whining, Martha's ""mothering"", Esposito calling everyone ""Bro"".  In season four, they all turned into cartoon characters.5. Nathan Fillion has trouble with drama.  It took me four seasons to realize this, but Nathan Fillion is not convincing doing dramatic scenes.  He does comedy well but seems out of his element when things get serious.I would love so much for the producers to turn things around and breathe some new life into the show.  Based on seeing the season five premiere, however, I am forced to predict that Castle's final season is upon us.

Stana Katic's Kate Beckett (my god, she's gorgeous) over the four seasons and into the fifth has matched facet for facet those of Castle.

In this darker, melodramatic season, there were a few times you could notice the actors actually struggle in their performances. There are also a few moments of poor editing. Season 4 really shows how well done the first three seasons were. By not being that well done.The two-part episode was Castle's ""jumping the shark"" moment for me. The bad icing on a poorly baked cake. No more Castle, ever.Andrew, enjoy your new membership in the Ministry of Trope Propaganda. From now on, I'll avoid anything you are attached to.",2,Not the same show.,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,613,"['One', 'great', 'things', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'cast', 'seemed', 'gel', 'effortlessly', 'darker', 'melodramatic', 'season', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'could', 'notice', 'actors', 'actually', 'struggle', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'moments', 'poor', 'editing', 'Season', '4', 'really', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', 'not', 'being', 'well', 'two-part', 'episode', 'was', 'Castle', 'jumping', 'shark', 'moment', 'bad', 'icing', 'poorly', 'baked', 'cake', 'more', 'Castle', 'ever.Andrew', 'enjoy', 'new', 'membership', 'Ministry', 'Trope', 'Propaganda', 'From', 'now', ""'ll"", 'avoid', 'anything', 'are', 'attached']",Castle: Season 4
