It captivated my attention from beginning to end. TODD WILLIAMS had my complete, undivided attention. He is some kinna finnnnnnne!!!  In addition to that, I loved the intelligence, the strength and the ambition that he brought to his character. When a man reaches his emotional threshold, the result can be quite devastating. MR WILLIAMS' character shattered me at the end, because it was so unexpected. Brilliant work!  Darrin Dewitt Hensen truly expanded his range in this particular acting role. I believe that most Black men actors would not step to the challenge in playing the particular role which Mr. Hensen took upon. Mr. Hensen reminds me of Vingh Rhames--a man who is comfortable and at home with himself. I loved the movie so much that I ended up buying three more copies to share with family and friends. This movie is definitely a must see. Before I forget, Tami Roman ROCKED IT!
