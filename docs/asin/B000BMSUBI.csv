It is a truely well written and well paced exposition of the process of growing up, making and keeping friends, and accepting a place in the world. Ang starts out as a kid who just wants to play and gradually over the series discovers how to be a responsible productive person. The side and back stories are also uplifting and instructive. Good for all ages. Most of the other things on Nick and CTV have devolved to cheap idiot food that has no art or story line.

944870,AP9UOXX9272YO,B000BMSUBI,"Amazon Customer ""Noble Poet""","[3, 5]","I can remember the first time catching the show on accident on Nickelodeon--I was channel surfing and came across this strange cartoon I had never seen before.  One that had a blue arrow on his head.  I thought to myself, wow, that's silly.  But I kept the show on and gave it a chance.  The more I watched, the more my interest grew.  So I watched it a few more times and to my great satisfaction and surprise, I think I've found a show to look forward to.Long ago existed an Avatar who was a master of bending the four great elements of the world--Water, Earth, Fire, and Air.  But then the Fire Nation waged war and havoc, wanting control and power over the world.  The only being who can save and unite the four nations again is the Avatar!  But when the world went searching for him, he disappeared for one hundred years, and war has reigned ever since.  By striking chance, a practicing water bender, Katara, and her brother Sokka, discover the new Avatar, Aang, who was frozen in ice since the disappearance of the last Avatar.  To much surprise, it is only a 12 year old boy!  Katara's and Sokka's destiny is now to help Aang find teachers to train Aang so he can master bending the four elements to restore peace in the world.  With the help of Momo, a fun white lemur, and his giant flying bison Appa, Aang sets his journey ahead of him with his new friends, which later he recognizes as his family.  But running after the Avatar is the banished Fire Nation prince, Zuko, who plans to capture the Avatar; something his father was never able to do.  By capturing the Avatar, Zuko hopes to restore his honor and respect from his people, and more importantly, respect from his father.I like this show because of its simple and kid-like nature.  Aang likes to have fun, even when it means having fun when he has the whole world depending on him to save the world.  His simple and open mind lead him into disasters and adventures, but he always comes out unharmed and with a new experience in which to learn from.  And when he and his friends are most in need, he's as dependable as they come.  I like the nature of a kid having fun and being simple minded, without the constant worries most adults seem to have in their lives.  This show examples why it is important not to forget to have fun, and that being just a kid, no matter how old, is ok to be sometimes.  The only drawback of the DVD is a common one amongst the other reviewers, in that there are only 4 episodes.  Fortunate for me, I discovered the show later than its premiere, so all the shows on the disc were new except Chapter 4.  But of course, I'd like to see more.  Four shows for me is just not enough!  Besides that, I'd recommend the show to both adults and children.  Nickelodeon has surprised me by airing a show like this on their station, as I don't recall ever having seen anime on it before (though I know there was a way while back), or any other show like this at all.  If you haven't seen Nickelodeon's Avatar: The Last Airbender, I'd highly suggest it.

944874,AK5448HOQZAOE,B000BMSUBI,C. Cobb,"[0, 0]","I don't see many reviews for this episode but rather for the entire season.This is a good episode.  We are introduced to Azula, a devious, borderline insane, power-hungry, sister of Zucko.  This is also the episode where we learn a little bit more about the Avatar state, hence the name.  Aang now has to be rather careful when he goes into the Avatar state, for if he dies, game over.  But what really shines in this episode is Iroh and Zucko.While this wasn't the official beginning of Zucko's transformation, it marks the beginning of his desire to find his own path and uncle Iroh is right there, willing to guide this brash young boy into a far better man.  I only wish I had had an uncle like Iroh.  The plot development for Aang is not as extensive as it is for Zucko and this being my second time through, this was also the point in the story where I started to care more about Zucko than Aang and co.This episode is good, but not great.  Mostly just groundwork being laid that will reach fruition much later in the season and series.  I truly do wish they would have allowed this series to go more than 3 years.  Instead they destroy it's legacy with the Legend of Korrah or whatever they call it.

944883,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000BMSUBI,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Most western animation for children is, to put it simply, really wretched. At best, it's tolerable.But a shining exception would be the tale of the Avatar of all four elements, and to restore the balance in the world. ""Avatar The Last Airbender - Book 1 Water, Vol. 1"" serves as a solid start to the series -- it smoothly introduces the characters and sets up some nice story arcs, without skimping on development of either.South Pole Water Tribe siblings Katara and Sokka stumble across a glowing iceberg with a young Airbender boy named Aang (and his flying bison) inside. All Airbenders were killed long ago. You guessed it (and so does Katara): Aang is the Avatar who mysteriously vanished a century ago, even though he has yet to master Earth, Water and Fire. And, uh, he's a total goofball.Unfortunately, a Fire Nation prince named Zuko has been wandering the world in search of Aang, and agrees to let the Water Tribe alone if Aang surrenders. Of course, Katara and Sokka set out to rescue their friend, and since Katara isn't experienced enough in waterbending to teach Aang, they set out for the North Pole to find a waterbending master.But along the way they run into new problems -- first Aang returns to his old Temple and finds it in ruins, with all the Airbenders dead. Then the three visit Kyoshi Island, where the female warriors take exception to Sokka's sexism, and Aang starts getting a bit full of himself. Meanwhile, Zuko's quest is put in jeopardy when an arrogant general challenges him to a firebending duel.The highest compliment I can pay ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is that it's like a thoroughly solid action/fantasy anime. Even though ""Book 1, Water: Volume 1"" is only the first few episodes of the series, it's pretty obvious that this is not a simple kid's show -- it's got good writing, excellent animation, and a general look rawn from Asian and Inuit cultures.The first episode is a bit lackluster -- there's a bit too much of Aang goofing around, riding penguins and exploring old battleships, as well as some gross-out humor. But things tart gelling with the explosive fight scenes and grim confrontations of the second episode, especially since we really get to know the Prince Zuko there and get a glimpse of the Fire Nation' power.And the whole quest-storyline has become nice and tight by the third and fourth episodes, even as our heroes stop for one-off stories. There's plenty of action and explosive fire-battles (particularly Zuko's brilliant battle with the sneering Zhao), but the writers never quite forget to include some comedy (riding the elephant koi) and character development.And they do a good job with the characters -- Aang soon proves himself a kind and selfless kid, but still a kid.

I LOVE Avatar: The Last Airbender and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something new and exciting to watch.  It's dramatic, suspenseful and very enjoyable to watch.  It's full of adventure as well.In a time when the world is divided into four nations:  Water tribes, earth kingdoms, fire nation and air nomads, it seems peaceful.  But that all changes when the greedy and power hungry fire nation starts a war with the other three nations.  The world's only hope is the Avatar, a boy who can master the bending disciplines of all four elements.  But he hasn't been seen for a hundred years.  It's not until a waterbender named Katara and her annoying older brother, Sokka, free Aang from an iceburg, do they uncover the world's last hope.  Now it's up to Aang to learn all four bending disciplines in order to end the war and bring balance back to the world.  With the help of Katara and Sokka, Aang will learn a lot more than the bending arts. He will learn what true friendship is.Water, earth, fire air.Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmonyThen everything changed when the fire nation attackedOnly the Avatar, master of all four elements could stop themBut when the world needed him most, he vanishedA hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar.  An airbender named Aang.  And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyoneBut I believe, Aang can save the worldJoin Katara, her annoying brother, Sokka and their friend, Aang, as they make their way to the North Pole in search of a waterbending teacher for Katara.  Also, As the Avatar, Aang must master all four elements in order to defeat the fire lord and restore balance to the world.I've been watching this show for nine months now and I LOVE it.  Katara is my favorite character and I believe Mae Whitman portrays her really well.  I LOVE this show and I can't wait till it comes to DVD.  Like Katara, my element is also water.

Sokka is responsible in his own way as well, but ends up as almost comic relief for some of the more emotionally charged scenes.Additional characters appear and stay with the series.  Prince Zuko is almost a foil for Aang at first before being shown as a more parallel character.  He travels with his Uncle, Iroh.  Zuko's sister and father, Fire Lord Ozai, tend to be the antagonists in the second book.  All are fire nation (the bad guys) but we see in both Zuko and Iroh that that fact does not automatically make them evil heartless killers.In book two we meet Toph, a blind earthbender girl who doesn't want her family to know that she's a capable bender.  She becomes Aang's earthbending master, and is quite a tough teacher despite her apparent handicap of blindness.The characters are memorable and well-developed.  The plot line is terrific with many different possiblities of how things could turn out. This is not a cartoon that cops out on sadness or death.  Avatar is not like some of the magical girl cartoons from Japan where people die and then in the next season or episode are right back up and kicking.  Avatar is a better reflection of real life.  When people die (and it's not always bad guys doing the dying) they do not come back. And sometimes the good guys do bad things either because they didn't have all the information or because there didn't seem to be any other alternative.  Hard lessons like truth, justice and good triumphant aren't always learned the first time.It's really a great cartoon for people of all ages and every stage of life.",5,Flat out the best cartoon in America,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,2494,"['literally', 'best', 'serialized', 'cartoon', 'made', 'Americans', 'past', '10', 'years', 'Michael', 'Dimartino', 'Bryan', 'Konietzko', 'have', 'created', 'fantasy', 'world', 'modeled', 'Asian', 'nations', 'culture', 'full', 'martial', 'arts', 'magic.Aang', 'Avatar', 'last', 'race', 'Airbenders', 'Avatar', 'capable', 'harnessing', 'four', 'elements', 'govern', 'world', 'keep', 'peace', 'four', 'races', 'one', 'element', 'populate', 'world', 'Shortly', 'learning', 'destiny', 'Avatar', 'Aang', 'away', 'responsiblity', 'death', 'becoming', 'lost', 'seastorm', 'Aang', 'sealed', 'ice', 'hundred', 'years.He', 'set', 'free', 'Katara', 'Sokka', 'who', 'eventually', 'become', 'traveling', 'companions', 'Katara', 'young', 'untrained', 'waterbender', 'driving', 'force', 'Aang', 'change', 'towards', 'responsibility', 'turn', 'Aang', 'Katara', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'time', 'Katara', 'waterbending', 'master', 'Sokka', 'responsible', 'own', 'way', 'well', 'up', 'almost', 'comic', 'relief', 'more', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'scenes.Additional', 'characters', 'appear', 'stay', 'series', 'Prince', 'Zuko', 'almost', 'foil', 'Aang', 'first', 'being', 'shown', 'more', 'parallel', 'character', 'Uncle', 'Iroh', 'Zuko', 'sister', 'father', 'Fire', 'Lord', 'Ozai', 'tend', 'be', 'antagonists', 'second', 'book', 'are', 'fire', 'nation', 'bad', 'guys', 'see', 'Zuko', 'Iroh', 'fact', 'not', 'automatically', 'make', 'evil', 'heartless', 'killers.In', 'book', 'two', 'meet', 'Toph', 'blind', 'earthbender', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'family', 'know', 'capable', 'bender', 'Aang', 'earthbending', 'master', 'quite', 'tough', 'teacher', 'apparent', 'handicap', 'blindness.The', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', 'well-developed', 'plot', 'line', 'terrific', 'many', 'different', 'possiblities', 'how', 'things', 'could', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'cartoon', 'out', 'sadness', 'death', 'Avatar', 'not', 'magical', 'girl', 'cartoons', 'Japan', 'where', 'people', 'die', 'then', 'next', 'season', 'episode', 'are', 'right', 'back', 'up', 'kicking', 'Avatar', 'better', 'reflection', 'real', 'life', 'When', 'people', 'die', 'not', 'always', 'bad', 'guys', 'doing', 'dying', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'back', 'sometimes', 'good', 'guys', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'information', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'other', 'alternative', 'Hard', 'lessons', 'truth', 'justice', 'good', 'triumphant', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'learned', 'first', 'time.It', 'really', 'great', 'cartoon', 'people', 'ages', 'stage', 'life']","Avatar: The Last Airbender: Book 1: Water, Vol. 1 (Checkpoint)"

It is a very funny episode, and begins the onslaught against one poor farmer who is forever getting his cabbage cart run into by somebody. He appears in later episodes as well, and his plaintive cry of ""My cabbages!"" is like a great parody of the dreaded ""fruit cart"" cliche in live action films.

An American team created an anime-stylized cartoon that is in every way better than any recent anime shows that have come out in the West. Avater really seems like a labor of love here. We have a wide, expansive plot, likeable characters, extremely well choreographed action, voice acting that's decent or, in the case of Mark Hamill as Fire Lord Ozai, incredible, and fantastic animation and color choices.There's really nothing not to love about this series. The fact that this show is performing so well even with older (college age!) viewers might be a signal to networks that if you let your shows have a little more freedom then you'll be rewarded. I won't hesitate to call Avatar the best animated show on TV at the moment, because unlike some of the anime that plays on Cartoon Network, Avatar appeals to all ages and isn't badly dubbed.There are funny parts, there are sad parts, and then there are just plain awesome parts to this show. It manages not to become formulaic (as some quest shows sometimes do) and each new episode continues the plot and expands the world. I don't think Avatar will stretch on forever, like some anime does, because the goal is in sight. It just takes the mastery of the four elements to be able to get there.With a third season in production, there's no reason not to buy these DVDs except for one: If Nickelodeon were smart they'd release season boxsets with all 20 episodes on 3 or 4 disks (double sided is fine as long as it minimizes costs) for an affordable $20-$35. Warner Bros. has done with their cartoons, and they've sold well. Anyway, hoping that this will happen, I still maintain that Avatar is an excellent cartoon which everyone can watch. It doesn't insult your intelligence and the action is amazing. Buy and watch this series to help keep supporting it until the end.",5,Americans have created a Cartoon better than any anime out there.,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,1875,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'possible', 'did', 'American', 'team', 'created', 'anime-stylized', 'cartoon', 'way', 'better', 'recent', 'anime', 'shows', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'West', 'Avater', 'really', 'labor', 'love', 'here', 'have', 'wide', 'expansive', 'plot', 'likeable', 'characters', 'extremely', 'well', 'choreographed', 'action', 'voice', 'acting', 'decent', 'case', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Fire', 'Lord', 'Ozai', 'incredible', 'fantastic', 'animation', 'color', 'choices.There', 'really', 'nothing', 'not', 'love', 'series', 'fact', 'show', 'performing', 'so', 'well', 'even', 'older', 'college', 'age', 'viewers', 'might', 'be', 'signal', 'networks', 'let', 'shows', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'freedom', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'call', 'Avatar', 'best', 'animated', 'show', 'TV', 'moment', 'anime', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Avatar', 'appeals', 'ages', ""n't"", 'badly', 'are', 'funny', 'parts', 'are', 'sad', 'parts', 'then', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'awesome', 'parts', 'show', 'not', 'become', 'formulaic', 'quest', 'shows', 'sometimes', 'do', 'new', 'episode', 'plot', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Avatar', 'will', 'stretch', 'forever', 'anime', 'goal', 'sight', 'just', 'mastery', 'four', 'elements', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'there.With', 'third', 'season', 'production', 'reason', 'not', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'one', 'Nickelodeon', 'were', 'smart', ""'d"", 'release', 'season', 'boxsets', '20', 'episodes', '3', '4', 'disks', 'double', 'sided', 'fine', 'as', 'long', 'costs', 'affordable', '20-', '35', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'done', 'cartoons', ""'ve"", 'sold', 'well', 'Anyway', 'hoping', 'will', 'happen', 'still', 'maintain', 'Avatar', 'excellent', 'cartoon', 'everyone', 'can', 'watch', ""n't"", 'insult', 'intelligence', 'action', 'amazing', 'Buy', 'watch', 'series', 'help', 'keep', 'supporting', 'end']","Avatar: The Last Airbender: Book 1: Water, Vol. 1 (Checkpoint)"

I'm glad nick finially put on some good shows, (ever since invader zim, and other classic nick shows were canceled)Plotline, a brother (saka) and sister(katara), two water tribe members (ability to use an art to control water) find a 1000 year old glacier with a boy trapped inside. The glacier melts and the boy, who is named Ang, he doesn't remember anything, or that his Air bending tribe was detroyed and everyone was killed) Katara and Saka soon discover that Ang is the Avatar (a bender capable of learning all bending techniques Air, water, fire and Earth) Katara and Saka try to help him learn all the bending techniques to help save the world from a war caused by the fire nation. Prince kuzo, a fire nation prince who was banished by his father is trying to gain honor by capturing the Avatar, so he pretty much slows them down xDAnyways, this is a pretty good show so far.
