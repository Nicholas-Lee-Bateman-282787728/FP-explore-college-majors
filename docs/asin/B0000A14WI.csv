Smith,"[0, 0]","Both volumes of this History Channel production from the mid-90s concentrate very heavily on WW2, not the entire first half of Churchill's extremely eventful life. I am reading William Manchester's multi-volume biography and was disappointed to find that the first 400 pages of the early life are covered in about 2 minutes on this DVD. The rest is geared toward Churchill's pivotal role as the man who saved Britain from the Nazis. Rightfully so was this deemed his greatest achievement, I suppose, but still I wanted more about his youth as a soldier when he had some great adventures in Africa and India, not to mention his days in government at the Admiralty and the Exchequer, or in WW1. Oh well, maybe there are other DVDs about all that. If you want several hours of Churchill during WW2, get this. Lots of archival footage and good talking heads here.",4,"Mostly about WW2, not the early life",1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,859,"['volumes', 'History', 'Channel', 'production', 'mid-90s', 'concentrate', 'very', 'heavily', 'WW2', 'not', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'Churchill', 'extremely', 'eventful', 'life', 'am', 'reading', 'William', 'Manchester', 'multi-volume', 'biography', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'first', '400', 'pages', 'early', 'life', 'are', 'covered', 'about', '2', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'rest', 'geared', 'Churchill', 'pivotal', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'saved', 'Britain', 'Nazis', 'Rightfully', 'so', 'was', 'deemed', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'suppose', 'still', 'wanted', 'more', 'youth', 'soldier', 'when', 'had', 'great', 'adventures', 'Africa', 'India', 'not', 'mention', 'days', 'government', 'Admiralty', 'Exchequer', 'WW1', 'Oh', 'well', 'maybe', 'are', 'other', 'DVDs', 'want', 'several', 'hours', 'Churchill', 'WW2', 'get', 'Lots', 'archival', 'footage', 'good', 'talking', 'heads', 'here']",Winston Churchill

DVD 1, jumps from one period to another without really informing on the issues and influences on the life of Winston Churchill. The second DVD had nothing do with Churchill and was more of a commercial for the History Channel's other products. Really disappointing this DVD set. For a better option, take a look at Churchill's Bodyguard which is more illustrative and informative on the great man as told by his former Scotland Yard Bodyguard.",3,Winston Churchill,1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,546,"['was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'selection', 'Not', 'much', 'detail', 'great', 'man', '2-dvd', 'set', 'DVD', '1', 'jumps', 'one', 'period', 'really', 'informing', 'issues', 'influences', 'life', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'second', 'DVD', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Churchill', 'was', 'more', 'commercial', 'History', 'Channel', 'other', 'products', 'Really', 'disappointing', 'DVD', 'set', 'better', 'option', 'take', 'look', 'Churchill', 'Bodyguard', 'more', 'illustrative', 'informative', 'great', 'man', 'told', 'former', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Bodyguard']",Winston Churchill

It's interesting that the British people turned their backs on him when the war was almost won. The British people have seen their country/culture slip considerably since they chose socialism.  Dumping Churchill accelerated this slide.,5,good history,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,375,"[""'m"", 'older', 'remember', 'youth', 'good', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'history', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'persons', '20th', 'century', 'interesting', 'British', 'people', 'turned', 'backs', 'when', 'war', 'was', 'almost', 'won', 'British', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'country/culture', 'slip', 'considerably', 'chose', 'socialism', 'Dumping', 'Churchill', 'accelerated', 'slide']",Winston Churchill

The amount of detail is amazing, especially all of the live footage from the period.  I watched ""The Gathering Storm"" and ""Into the Storm"".  These are both well done movies and gave me a desire to see what the real Churchill was like.  This series will not disappoint and you will be amazed at what this great man did, especially how much time he spent on the front line with the troops during WWII.

761023,A2RELWKFCZRB8G,B0000A14WI,Serge J. Van Steenkiste,"[36, 36]","Winston Churchill, a two-DVD set from The History Channel, will delight both connoisseurs and neophytes.  Archival footage, interviews with people who knew Churchill and, last but not least, narrative by Winston's official biographer Martin Gilbert make this series stand out among the visual productions dedicated to Churchill.  Gilbert makes Churchill accessible to a wide audience by keeping his narrative both erudite and lighthearted.In Volume I, Gilbert opts for a chronological approach to his subject.  Describing Churchill, however, is tricky.  First, Churchill, either in turn or concomitantly, was a journalist, historian, soldier, painter, and statesman.  Furthermore, as one of his early conquests noted in 1905, ""The first time you meet Winston, you see all his faults, and the rest of your life you spend in discovering his virtues.""  Churchill embodied over time vision and foresight, humanity and sense of fair play, democracy and patriotism, formidable powers of work and thought, as well as controversy, disappointment and abuse.To his credit, Gilbert clearly narrates the ups and downs in his tumultuous career.  Many people, who are unfamiliar with Churchill's biography, can be forgiven for ignoring the many setbacks that Churchill experienced in his early career before finally becoming the iconic figure for which he is generally known today.  Sometimes, Churchill was his worst enemy because of his own excesses.In Volume II, James Faulkner focuses on the workings of the war room from where Churchill led the war against the Axis powers.  John Daly then covers the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt and the special relationship that Roosevelt developed with Churchill during WWII.  Volume I will probably enthrall more than Volume II because of the stature of its narrator.To summarize, Winston Churchill ranks among the best productions ever made for a broad audience.",5,Churchill's Enduring Magnetism in a Disoriented World,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,1895,"['Winston', 'Churchill', 'two-DVD', 'set', 'History', 'Channel', 'will', 'delight', 'connoisseurs', 'neophytes', 'Archival', 'footage', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Churchill', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'narrative', 'Winston', 'official', 'biographer', 'Martin', 'Gilbert', 'make', 'series', 'stand', 'out', 'visual', 'productions', 'dedicated', 'Churchill', 'Gilbert', 'Churchill', 'accessible', 'wide', 'audience', 'keeping', 'narrative', 'erudite', 'lighthearted.In', 'Volume', 'Gilbert', 'chronological', 'approach', 'subject', 'Describing', 'Churchill', 'however', 'tricky', 'First', 'Churchill', 'either', 'turn', 'concomitantly', 'was', 'journalist', 'historian', 'soldier', 'painter', 'statesman', 'Furthermore', 'one', 'early', 'conquests', 'noted', '1905', 'first', 'time', 'meet', 'Winston', 'see', 'faults', 'rest', 'life', 'spend', 'discovering', 'virtues', 'Churchill', 'embodied', 'time', 'vision', 'foresight', 'humanity', 'sense', 'fair', 'play', 'democracy', 'patriotism', 'formidable', 'powers', 'work', 'thought', 'as', 'well', 'controversy', 'disappointment', 'abuse.To', 'credit', 'Gilbert', 'clearly', 'ups', 'downs', 'tumultuous', 'career', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Churchill', 'biography', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'ignoring', 'many', 'setbacks', 'Churchill', 'experienced', 'early', 'career', 'finally', 'becoming', 'iconic', 'figure', 'generally', 'known', 'today', 'Sometimes', 'Churchill', 'was', 'worst', 'enemy', 'own', 'excesses.In', 'Volume', 'II', 'James', 'Faulkner', 'workings', 'war', 'room', 'where', 'Churchill', 'led', 'war', 'Axis', 'powers', 'John', 'Daly', 'then', 'presidency', 'Franklin', 'Roosevelt', 'special', 'relationship', 'Roosevelt', 'developed', 'Churchill', 'WWII', 'Volume', 'will', 'probably', 'enthrall', 'more', 'Volume', 'II', 'stature', 'narrator.To', 'summarize', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'best', 'productions', 'ever', 'made', 'broad', 'audience']",Winston Churchill
