1076680,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000QUCNOU,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[7, 8]","There's nothing quite like a mystery.  Lately, we have gotten a lot of films involving investigative puzzles.  (`The Davinci Code,' `Inside Man,' and `National Treasure,' come to mind.)  Such is the case with `Zodiac,' except this film is a true-to-life crime story about a serial killer who stalked victims in Vallejo and San Francisco, CA starting in 1969.  It was unprecedented at the time because the police success rate was good until then, and the ""Summer of Love"" was a not-too-distant memory.  Gripping at times, the whole movie becomes an illuminating account of heinous crimes by a clever killer who managed to slip out of investigators hands for years.Starting in Vallejo a mysterious hooded stranger stalks a teenage couple who are parked at Lovers' Lane on the Fourth of July.  In a separate car he stops by and harasses them briefly before returning to the scene.  Using a gun with a flashlight attached, he mercilessly shoots and kills both of them in the car.  There are other similar acts that follow scattered from that first murder, but he refuses to remain completely anonymous. Thriving on publicity, he calls the police to announce his crimes--briefly, but precisely identifying his cruel acts with his victims.  He also sends letters to `The San Francisco Chronicle' with code work meant for them to decipher. Similar confidence appears as he announces their cruel fate to loved ones and sends letters with no code, written in handwriting hard to trace.  Nicknamed ""Zodiac"" he terrorizes the people of California, leaving clues like a morbid real-life Riddler.  Having skeletons in his closet and a fascination for the short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" Zodiac remained mysterious, yet committed to his mayhem.Most of the drama zeroes in of the investigation, which is two fold.  For 'The San Francisco Chronicle' columnist, Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and political cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) are at odds with one another, but see eye to eye enough to share drinks and some of the investigation together.  In another part of town, Inspector Dave Tocchi (Mark Ruffalo) tries to piece it all together.  He's smart and thorough, but has many difficulties.  As the years go by, we see suspects come and go and how little pieces of the puzzle fit together to find a composite portrait.  Obviously, it is not a labor of love, given the scope and energy required for the project, but one of the ironies of the story is Graysmith's persistence with the case.  Having an inquisitive and ambitious nature himself, he doesn't have the sensibility to throw in the towel.`Zodiac' is not only fascinating, but is laid-back enough to give us a true-to-life drama.  All of the actors only magnify the account by their grasp of the humanness of their characters.  The three stars Gyllenhaal, Downey, and Ruffalo especially keep it real.  Thanks to director David Fincher and screenwriter James Vanderbilt, we are transported to a troubled time and place with expert detail.  It is suspenseful at times, but the understatement along with some old newsreels only adds to the authenticity.  Their weariness and the problems they face make it all the more human.  Both journalists grapple with ambition while they juggle their responsibilities and their personal lives.  Both Paul and Robert are contacted by the killer and the repercussions quietly take their toll.  'Zodiac' excels at method and execution, retracing the steps of ordinary people trying to solve an extraordinary crime.",4,"""Methods to His Madness""",1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,3519,"['nothing', 'quite', 'mystery', 'Lately', 'have', 'gotten', 'lot', 'films', 'involving', 'investigative', 'puzzles', 'Davinci', 'Code', 'Man', 'National', 'Treasure', 'come', 'mind', 'Such', 'case', 'Zodiac', 'film', 'true-to-life', 'crime', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'stalked', 'victims', 'Vallejo', 'San', 'Francisco', 'CA', 'starting', '1969', 'was', 'unprecedented', 'time', 'police', 'success', 'rate', 'was', 'good', 'then', 'Summer', 'Love', 'was', 'not-too-distant', 'memory', 'Gripping', 'times', 'whole', 'movie', 'illuminating', 'account', 'heinous', 'crimes', 'clever', 'killer', 'who', 'managed', 'slip', 'investigators', 'hands', 'years.Starting', 'Vallejo', 'mysterious', 'hooded', 'stranger', 'stalks', 'teenage', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'parked', 'Lovers', 'Lane', 'Fourth', 'July', 'separate', 'car', 'harasses', 'briefly', 'returning', 'scene', 'Using', 'gun', 'flashlight', 'attached', 'mercilessly', 'shoots', 'kills', 'car', 'are', 'other', 'similar', 'acts', 'follow', 'scattered', 'first', 'murder', 'remain', 'completely', 'anonymous', 'Thriving', 'publicity', 'police', 'announce', 'crimes', 'briefly', 'precisely', 'identifying', 'cruel', 'victims', 'also', 'letters', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'code', 'work', 'meant', 'decipher', 'Similar', 'confidence', 'cruel', 'fate', 'loved', 'ones', 'letters', 'code', 'written', 'handwriting', 'hard', 'trace', 'Nicknamed', 'Zodiac', 'people', 'California', 'leaving', 'clues', 'morbid', 'real-life', 'Riddler', 'Having', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'fascination', 'short', 'story', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'Zodiac', 'remained', 'mysterious', 'yet', 'committed', 'mayhem.Most', 'drama', 'investigation', 'two', 'fold', ""'The"", 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'columnist', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'political', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', 'odds', 'one', 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'enough', 'share', 'drinks', 'investigation', 'together', 'part', 'town', 'Inspector', 'Dave', 'Tocchi', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'piece', 'together', 'smart', 'thorough', 'many', 'difficulties', 'years', 'go', 'see', 'suspects', 'come', 'go', 'how', 'little', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'fit', 'together', 'find', 'composite', 'portrait', 'Obviously', 'not', 'labor', 'love', 'given', 'scope', 'energy', 'required', 'project', 'one', 'ironies', 'story', 'Graysmith', 'persistence', 'case', 'Having', 'inquisitive', 'ambitious', 'nature', ""n't"", 'have', 'sensibility', 'throw', 'towel.', 'Zodiac', 'not', 'only', 'fascinating', 'laid-back', 'enough', 'give', 'true-to-life', 'drama', 'actors', 'only', 'magnify', 'account', 'grasp', 'humanness', 'characters', 'three', 'stars', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Downey', 'Ruffalo', 'especially', 'keep', 'real', 'Thanks', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'Vanderbilt', 'are', 'transported', 'troubled', 'time', 'place', 'expert', 'detail', 'suspenseful', 'times', 'understatement', 'old', 'newsreels', 'only', 'authenticity', 'weariness', 'problems', 'face', 'make', 'more', 'human', 'journalists', 'grapple', 'ambition', 'juggle', 'responsibilities', 'personal', 'lives', 'Paul', 'Robert', 'are', 'contacted', 'killer', 'repercussions', 'quietly', 'take', 'toll', 'excels', 'method', 'execution', 'retracing', 'steps', 'ordinary', 'people', 'trying', 'solve', 'extraordinary', 'crime']",N/A

Another letter arrives at the newspaper with an insane threat. [The film reminds us of the old technology in use then.] Books tell about ciphers and codes.

1076684,A86QD3XO8ZXI8,B000QUCNOU,"Aficianado, ""Music, Film and Book Lover""","[8, 12]","**May Contain Spoiler**I can't remember the last time I saw a movie in which I didn't want to miss a single frame. ""Zodiac"", an excellent film by director David Fincher fills that bill however. The movie is gripping and full of tension from start to finish even though the story of the infamous ""Zodiac"" killer of northern California is well known to many of us who lived through it. It is a completely fascinating crime drama, one which I think actually surpasses Fincher's noted ""Se7en"" in quality.For those who are unfamiliar with the story, this strange killer terrorized northern California during the 70's and late 60's and relied on cryptology as well as astrological symbols to further his reign of terror. Completely unrelated to another ""Zodiac"" killer who used similar astrological codes and stalked the New York City area in the early 90's, the story of the California ""Zodiac"" has found it's way into the annals of crime lore, possibly ranking up with such stories as the ""Black Dahlia"", or ""Jack the Ripper"" as one of the most noted unsolved crime mysteries to date.""Zodiac"" captures the look and feel of late 60's and early 70's San Francisco and Northern California, an era of the Patty Hearst kidnapping, ""free love"" and Ronald Reagen as California governor. As a ""period piece"", the film is remarkably authentic, capturing all aspects of that era down to the famous giant ""smiles"" on the now defunct PSA (Pacific Southern Airlines) airplanes. It ""looked"" as if it actually had been made during the time period in which it was set, rather than almost 30 years later. The cinematography is excellent throughout and there are two particularly breathtaking shots in the movie, one of the valley around Modesto, California at night and another taken from the top of the Golden Gate bridge.""Zodiac"" in fact reminded me in both look, feel and attention to detail of another great thriller about the same era in US history, (albeit a political thriller in that case) the great ""All The President's Men"", by Alan Pakula. I found the ""Golden Gate Bridge"" shot in this movie to be very reminiscent of the famous shot taken from the top of the Library of Congress in Pakula's thriller and the entire movie details a similarly intense, relentless quest for the truth as in ""All The President's Men"".Fincher keeps the action taut, with a sense of underlying danger permeating the entire movie. While one might quibble with a few scenes here and there (for example, one scene where a woman and her baby are kidnapped by the Zodiac is never fully developed or it's outcome fully explained) the movie is particularly thorough in detailing the story. The acting is universally excellent throughout the film and Robert Downey Jr. is particularly good, playing a quirky, alcoholic reporter who faces the same type of demons that Downey himself apparently faced earlier in his life.One of the better crime dramas in recent years, I would highly recommend this film.",5,One of the Best Crime Dramas in Years,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,2962,"['**May', 'Contain', 'Spoiler**I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'single', 'frame', 'Zodiac', 'excellent', 'film', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'bill', 'however', 'movie', 'gripping', 'full', 'tension', 'start', 'finish', 'even', 'story', 'infamous', 'Zodiac', 'killer', 'northern', 'California', 'well', 'known', 'many', 'who', 'lived', 'completely', 'fascinating', 'crime', 'drama', 'one', 'think', 'actually', 'Fincher', 'noted', 'Se7en', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'strange', 'killer', 'terrorized', 'northern', 'California', '70', 'late', '60', 'relied', 'cryptology', 'as', 'well', 'astrological', 'symbols', 'further', 'reign', 'terror', 'Completely', 'unrelated', 'Zodiac', 'killer', 'who', 'used', 'similar', 'astrological', 'codes', 'stalked', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'area', 'early', '90', 'story', 'California', 'Zodiac', 'found', 'way', 'annals', 'crime', 'lore', 'possibly', 'ranking', 'up', 'such', 'stories', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'one', 'most', 'noted', 'unsolved', 'crime', 'mysteries', 'date', 'Zodiac', 'look', 'feel', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Northern', 'California', 'era', 'Patty', 'Hearst', 'kidnapping', 'free', 'love', 'Ronald', 'Reagen', 'California', 'governor', 'period', 'piece', 'film', 'remarkably', 'authentic', 'capturing', 'aspects', 'era', 'down', 'famous', 'giant', 'smiles', 'now', 'defunct', 'PSA', 'Pacific', 'Southern', 'Airlines', 'airplanes', 'looked', 'actually', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'set', 'rather', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'later', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'are', 'two', 'particularly', 'breathtaking', 'shots', 'movie', 'one', 'valley', 'Modesto', 'California', 'night', 'taken', 'top', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'bridge', 'Zodiac', 'fact', 'reminded', 'look', 'feel', 'attention', 'detail', 'great', 'thriller', 'same', 'era', 'US', 'history', 'political', 'thriller', 'case', 'great', 'President', 'Men', 'Alan', 'Pakula', 'found', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'shot', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'famous', 'shot', 'taken', 'top', 'Library', 'Congress', 'Pakula', 'thriller', 'entire', 'movie', 'details', 'similarly', 'intense', 'relentless', 'quest', 'truth', 'President', 'Men', 'action', 'taut', 'sense', 'underlying', 'danger', 'permeating', 'entire', 'movie', 'one', 'might', 'quibble', 'few', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'woman', 'baby', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'Zodiac', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'outcome', 'fully', 'explained', 'movie', 'particularly', 'thorough', 'detailing', 'story', 'acting', 'universally', 'excellent', 'film', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'particularly', 'good', 'playing', 'quirky', 'alcoholic', 'reporter', 'who', 'same', 'type', 'demons', 'Downey', 'apparently', 'faced', 'earlier', 'life.One', 'better', 'crime', 'dramas', 'recent', 'years', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

1076686,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B000QUCNOU,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[15, 18]","~In December 1968, police were called to the scene of a double homicide; no motive, no suspects, no witnesses. On July 4th, 1969, ""he"" struck again, but this time, one of the victims lived. The survivor's name was Mike Mageau, and he is now one of the consultants in this top-notch movie. The attack on Mageau, and the girl he wanted to one day marry, named Darlene Ferrin, comprise the first sequence in the film. Thusly, the the December attack isn't depicted. This is because the makers of ""Zodiac"" wisely chose to only recreate the crimes which had witnesses or survivors, removing as much speculation from the script as possible.But, to the dismay of today's A.D.D. riddled audience, there are only three scenes of violence in ""Zodiac,"" although they are recreated with such authenticity, anyone already familiar with the story will cringe at how brutal and heartless the crimes are. Bryan Hartnell, who survived the attack at Lake Berryessa in September 1969, says he actually had to look away during the scene involving him. The realism was simply too much to handle. For this sequence, the film crew actually went to Lake Berryessa, and, referring to crime scene photos, reconstructed the crime scene to look exactly as it did the day of this attack, even transplanting trees to replicate scene as closely as possible. It's strange, Lake Berryessa is a breath-takingly beautiful location, the scenery is simply gorgeous. But, it has the permanent stigma of being the location where the suspect donned an executioner's outfit and hog-tied Bryan Hartnell and Cecilia Sheperd at gunpoint, butchering them with a hunting knife. It is one of the most horrifying scenes ever filmed, because it is faithfully reproduced, with almost 100% accuracy. It's difficult to watch.""Zodiac: The Director's Cut"" is a very long film, almost three hours in total, with very little real on-screen action, but it is a fascinating movie. It focuses on San Francisco Chronicle employee Robert Graysmith's obsession with the case, and his personal and professional relationship with fellow newspaper employee Paul Avery, as well as the fear that spread through the San Francisco area once this crime spree made the paper. It is a story of obsession, as already stated, but it vividly tells the audience exactly how frustrating this case was to the police and the media. It has derailed careers and jeopardized health, as well as causing an extended panic all over California. The joke about California being a cereal bowl comes to mind. It has its share of fruits, nuts, and flakes, and it becomes apparent here. Of course, in all fairness, weird people live all over the place, so don't call me out on it. Just a comment.It is frustrating to the audience as well as the police, because no suspect has ever been caught, and none are arrested, even in the film. The prime suspect, one Arthur Leigh Allen, had his share of scrapes with the law, usually on sex-related charges, and had even done hard prison time for these offenses, and virtually all of the Zodiac evidence points directly to him, but various little things throw just enough of a wrench into the works to keep him from being formally charged. And when a solid enough case is finally built against him, the arresting officer found Allen dead on his floor, the victim of a fatal heart attack. So, if he really was the Zodiac, his letter claiming they will never catch him came true, because he never did one day of prison time for the Zodiac killings.This release has a treasure trove of material; you have the uncut movie, the director's vision being shown in tact, with almost every little nuance covered.

From the title, you already know that the killer is the infamous (and so far unidentified) Zodiac, and because the case is still unsolved, the ending is understandably vague.The next thing you should know is that it's a long movie that takes you step by step through the case from the shooting of Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau to the publication of Robert Graysmith's first book of the same name.It very effectively chronicles the personal and career upheavals of the main characters, especially the fixation of Graysmith (Sensitive guy Jake Gyllenhaal who's no stranger to obsessive roles), the dedication of Inspector David Toschi (a rumpled looking Mark Ruffalo) and the unpredictability of crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jnr. doing what he does best).At some points you can almost hear Graysmith's torment - ""I wish I knew how to quit you Zodiac killer"" - and at these moments you'll wish for Lilly Rush and the Cold Case team to come in and solve it once and for all.

It was like going back in time to the days of yesteryear! A time without international terrorism and a time where we were on the right track in America! Yes, there was Vietnam and the cruelty of the American South, but San-Francisco represented what was progressive in America. The Zodiac changed that and San Francisco would never be the same again.Mark Rufalo and Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey, Jr. were awesome! The director, Fincher handles his cast and crew perfectly and had a deft cinematic touch with. I loved the subtle allusions to today vs yesterday. ""We don't have a telefax yet..."" Then there were the ubiquitous pay phones of the 1960s-1970s. Devices I wish would make a comeback in the 21st century. Allusions to Dirty Harry and seeing the Transamerica building go up were marvels of American cinema. Let's not forget the slinky commercial!! Wow! I've seen that commercial before and it is hilarious!The killer, whoever he was, was a savage man. When Paul Stine was shot in the head, the call went out that a black man had committed the crime. The stupidity of Officer Dan Fouke (Shown, But Not Named In The Film) allowed the killer to escape. This point is hammered home in a powerful scene where Rufalo just stares at the poor policing of the two uniformed cops. While not directly mentioned, the subtle racism of the cops is an underlying current of the scene. They were so concerned about ""getting a black man"" that they let the murdurer walk right by them. ""He was shuffling along,"" Houk says. ""Did you even question him?"" ""No,"" Houk shakes his head. The thought never occured to Houk that night that there may have been two men involved in the crime, or that the initial report was wrong. His lack of imagination and two diomensional thinking, and yes, perhaps racism, ended up allowing the killer to escape and taunt the police again and again.I saw the movie three days ago and have yet to see any of the special features, but when I do they will be the icing on this cake.

1076690,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B000QUCNOU,Andrew Desmond,"[3, 4]","""Zodiac"" is a wonderful whodunit genre film set in San Francisco and its environs in the 1970s and 1980s.  It is based on the true story of a presumed serial killer who identified himself as ""Zodiac"".  He was successful in terrorising the broader community.Unlike most Hollywood crime films, ""Zodiac"" has no crisp ending where the bad guy is killed or captured and all the loose ends are tidied up.  Rather, the film concludes with the killer still at large notwithstanding many suspicions.  Of course, many murder investigations end this way but rarely so in Hollywood.The film is well scripted with many outstanding performances.  Robert Downey Junior as the drunken newspaper crime writer, Brian Cox as the media savvy lawyer Melvin Belli, Jake Gyllenhaal as the awkward cartoonist turned crime writer and Mark Ruffalo as the hardened cop immediately come to mind.  It's a great ensemble cast.If I was to have any criticism of the film, it is that it's a bit too long.  Sure, the plot is complex and details need to be explained but a film in excess of 2  hours is testing an audience's patience.  However, this criticism is not substantive in the greater scheme of things.  Do not let this comment distract the viewer.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and can recommend it to all.  Its languid yet enthralling pace, its clever recreation of the time, its ambiguous conclusions and its very competent cast ensure that this is a film well worth seeing.",5,A Clever and Unusual Whodunit,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,1453,"['Zodiac', 'wonderful', 'whodunit', 'genre', 'film', 'set', 'San', 'Francisco', 'environs', '1970s', '1980s', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'presumed', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'identified', 'Zodiac', 'was', 'successful', 'terrorising', 'broader', 'community.Unlike', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'crime', 'films', 'Zodiac', 'crisp', 'ending', 'where', 'bad', 'guy', 'killed', 'captured', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tidied', 'up', 'Rather', 'film', 'killer', 'still', 'large', 'notwithstanding', 'many', 'suspicions', 'course', 'many', 'murder', 'investigations', 'end', 'way', 'rarely', 'so', 'Hollywood.The', 'film', 'well', 'scripted', 'many', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Junior', 'drunken', 'newspaper', 'crime', 'writer', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'media', 'savvy', 'lawyer', 'Melvin', 'Belli', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'awkward', 'cartoonist', 'turned', 'crime', 'writer', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'hardened', 'cop', 'immediately', 'come', 'mind', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast.If', 'was', 'have', 'criticism', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'Sure', 'plot', 'complex', 'details', 'need', 'be', 'explained', 'film', 'excess', '2', 'hours', 'testing', 'audience', 'patience', 'However', 'criticism', 'not', 'substantive', 'greater', 'scheme', 'things', 'Do', 'not', 'let', 'comment', 'distract', 'viewer', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'can', 'recommend', 'languid', 'yet', 'enthralling', 'pace', 'clever', 'recreation', 'time', 'ambiguous', 'conclusions', 'very', 'competent', 'cast', 'ensure', 'film', 'well', 'seeing']",N/A
1076691,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000QUCNOU,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","In what may very well be David Fincher's best film since `Se7en' the audience is taken on a dark and mysterious ride through the lives of a select few, from policemen to reporters to cartoonists who all have one, and really only one, thing in common, the Zodiac Killer.  Now, having just seen `American Gangster' this past weekend and just now having seen `Zodiac' for the first time I feel that I can safely dispel all comparisons.  Personally I don't think the two are comparable, although I've seen many judge one off the other.  I won't say now which I feel is the better film since at this point they are both in my top five of the year, but I will say that each in their own rights deserves the attention they have been garnered.  Hopefully Oscar buzz will carry this early release to the finish line for it deserves a slew of nominations, Best Picture not absent from that list.The film is based off of the novels written by Robert Graysmith chronicling the investigations of the many Zodiac murders which started in the mid-60's.  With that said the film revolves around Graysmith himself and his unhealthy obsession with the killer and discovering his identity.  Graysmith was not a detective, not a police officer; in fact he wasn't even a reporter.  Graysmith was a cartoonist with a knack for puzzles who just so happened to crack one or two sent by the killer and thus started his freefall into dangerous territory.The Zodiac Killer took many lives, most of which were not by means of a gun or knife, and that is what this movie exploits.  This movie is less about the people The Zodiac murdered and more about the people who suffered greatly while attempting to find him.  Robert Graysmith, Inspector David Toschi and reporter Paul Avery all lost years of their lives to this case, self inflicted as it may have been.  They lost family, respect, jobs...all in the pursuit of a killer who, to this day, has never been captured.  Graysmith says to his wife Melanie that he needs to know who The Zodiac is, he needs to look him in the eyes and know that it is him.  I'm forced to ask myself, why?  I mean, is it really worth wrecking your whole life just to track down someone who couldn't care less about you?Maybe it is.Maybe it was.The one thing that I admired about `Zodiac' and `American Gangster' as well (I will write my review for `American Gangster' soon...most likely when the DVD is released) is that they both take their time.  They are not in a rush to tell a story; in fact they slow things down and make sure that they tell the story right.  They breathe life into their characters so that the audience can feel a connection.  So, I assume you can tell from that statement that this is not a short movie.  It's slow paced which adds to the overall feeling of the film.  It's eerie, it's creepy, it's dramatic...it's here to instill paranoia (`American Gangster' is slow paced as well but not for the same reasons...it is far from eerie).  David Fincher does a fantastic job of understanding the mood he is creating and embellishing upon it.  It reminds me of the feeling I got while watching Bennett Miller's film `Capote'.Fincher also lucked out with his electric cast.  Everyone participating in this film does a fantastic job, none more so than Robert Downey Jr., who in my humble opinion should be frontrunner for the Oscar (but alas, he's not).  Downey Jr. beautifully fleshes out Paul Avery, giving him charm and charisma and drive and then masterfully deteriorates him so that the audience can see the man The Zodiac left behind.  Mark Ruffalo also delivers excellence as David Toschi.  He has such fervor, such motivation until his everything starts to crumble and he seeks to escape.  What is beautiful to see in each of these performances is that while both men try and distance themselves from The Zodiac we can see that it is within this enigma that they truly flourish for when Graysmith approaches both men with the subject their eyes ignite, even if they turn him away.Jake Gyllenhaal is effective here as Graysmith, but he gets lost a bit amidst such an eclectic cast.  Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo chew so much scenery that Gyllenhaal struggles at times to remain the center of attention.  He's a fine actor and is slowly by surely being molded into a great one, but it becomes apparent when placed beside better actors with sufficient material that he is still out of their league.The long list of supporting players is impressive as well.  I love me some Chloe Sevigny, and even though her role is a small one she is supremely effective.  Brian Cox and Philip Baker Hall are great in their roles and Anthony Edwards does a fine job of playing second fiddle to Ruffalo.  Most impressive though is John Carroll Lynch who plays the prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen.  He only has a few scenes, one in particular where he is interviewed, but that one scene has such presence.  He creeped me out and it was daylight.In the end `Zodiac' is a superb film, a stunning and mesmerizing example of cinematic perfection.  It's not a horror film but is a film that will succeed in getting under your skin and biting at your nerves.  Fincher should be praised (as he has been) for creating one of the best crime thrillers in years, a film that sets the bar for films to follow.  Now if only every crime drama could reach these heights.",5,A brilliantly composed masterpiece of a film...,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,5371,"['what', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'David',

1076692,A3W3LP0RSWLJCS,B000QUCNOU,Annihilatrix1138,"[0, 0]","I really don't know where to begin with David Fincher's ZODIAC. It is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time. Not sure how this came to be or what it says about my character. I remember not even really caring so much about it the first time I saw it. I mean, it's a story about an unsolved murder: one that has been cold for over three decades. Not only that, but it's not even a ""slasher film"" if you get right down to it. More like a three hour true-crime film. And you (perhaps) never see the real killer's face in the film once, depending on how you view it.Then why did this movie come to scare me so much? How did it succeed in frightening me more so than any other slasher/killer flick that I've ever seen? It's because, when you come to realize the circumstances surrounding the Zodiac murders, you'll find that this movie is more-or-less dead accurate to the smallest detail. (Me living very close to where these murders took place probably didn't help matters either!)To summarize the plot, ZODIAC mostly centers around a San Francisco Chronicle political cartoonist, named Robert Graysmith. He comes to work as he usually does to discover that a killer has sent the Chronicle a written confession to a series of murders. In addition, this Zodiac goes out of his way to taunt the publication by stating that if a cipher he has included with the letter isn't printed in the newspaper, he will kill again. But this story is not strictly about the murderer's acts, but more about the surrounding investigation, and how it goes from bad to worse.This movie is frightening when you discover the level of detail that has been painstakingly weaved into this movie (I've come to expect this with every David Fincher film I watch). Most of the murder scenes were filmed where the actual killings took place. And since there had been survivors, you get an accurate account of how these fatal encounters actually went down. Every behavioral tick that the Zodiac actually exhibited during the murders are reconstructed to the smallest detail. From what he said to how he acted to how he seemed almost like he was cheesing it up at times. This is one of the only movies I've seen where I felt like I was getting inside the mind of this killer.There is a lot of drama here, and excellent performers by all of the actors. Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr. expertly pull off their roles as men who become caught in a downward spiral into paranoia and near-insanity with every passing day that the Zodiac is never caught. Mark Ruffalo does an excellent job channeling Detective Dave Toschi, the real life SF homicide detective who became the inspiration for both DIRTY HARRY and BULLITT (a fact brought up in the film). Finally, John Carroll Lynch pulls off a very haunting, but very brief, performance as the man who would become the prime suspect in the case. At first, one might think that he's laying it on kind of weak, until you realize that this is actually how A.L.N. behaved during the interview. You see every flinch, every hint of nervousness, and every hesitation. That is brilliant acting, I must say.In a nutshell, this is still a movie about a case that was never solved, but it came very close. The filmmakers never specifically say that THIS HERE was the man who should be blamed for these murders, but it lays out all the evidence for the viewer and asks US to make the decision for ourselves. In that sense, we become the detectives in this case.I would encourage anyone with a passing interest in the investigation to watch the documentary included with this Director's Cut. You will see for yourself just how close this movie came to translating the real events, and you just might find yourself trying to piece together the puzzle with the main characters. This is a powerful and tragically underrated film (and probably David Fincher's best work to date) and carries with it a mass of question marks that might never be answered. But ZODIAC challenges us to try.Do yourself a favor and pick up this Director's Cut of ZODIAC.

1076694,ARA48345JZPZR,B000QUCNOU,Archmaker,"[13, 16]","""Why?""  That's the response from Robert Graysmith's frightened and increasingly estranged wife to the above statement and the fixation it represents.  Why indeed?  Because just as the newspapers, police and citizenry of Northern California had been siezed by the terror and frustration of the random murders perpetrated by the elusive, self-proclaimed Zodiac, Graysmith's interest in discovering his identity has turned into all-consuming obsession.  And we come to this moment only in the last third of this movie, as the leadup to this has been a fascinating police procedural unfolding with the same mistaken assumptions, false leads, jurisdictional problems (several different counties and investigations proceeding in unknowing parallel), and missed opportunities that occurred in the real case.I say ""fascinating"" because I found it so.  I have a fondness for films depicting how professionals go about their business, and I have great admiration for David Fincher's exploration of the day-to-day wear and tear it exerts upon those involved in the agonizingly slow and painstaking work required trying to capture a taunting, headline-hungry, cruel and despicable monster like the Zodiac.  However, if you are looking for a thriller such as Fincher's own ""7even"" you should give this a pass, as he is after different elements here.It is a long film at plus 2-1/2 hrs, but I was thoroughly engrossed in the atmosphere and tension of the film.  I remember this period (60's-70's), and Fincher's evocation of San Francisco, the city and its culture then, is spot on.  I found his camera perspectives and framing coming at this material from all sorts of angles, high and low, over and around, far and near, both smooth and fresh. Yet his style doesn't overwhelm the detailed and intricate telling of the story, but rather enhances it.The cast is first rate in all departments, and it would be unfair to single out any of the leads as this is true ensemble work. Let me just echo some other reviewers in stating that Mark Ruffalo as the true-life Inspector Steve McQueen modeled Bullitt on and Anthony Edwards as his less colorful but solid partner, Robert Downey's flamboyant, talented but self-destructing reporter, and finally Gyllenhaal's increasingly compulsive cartoonist all have fine scenes, well done. Elias Koteas, Donal Logue, Brian Cox, Chloe Sevigney, Charles Fleischer and John Carroll Lynch all do solid supporting work.Working from factual material including the eponymous book Graysmith ultimately produced about the case, Fincher has created an intricate and complex look at the spell cast by a vile celebrity-seeking, notorious monster/nobody whose apprehension is always just beyond reach. He tells a big story with deftness and great craft.  It won't be a film for everyone, but I was in it for this one to the end.  Movies are as long as they need to be, and this one is no exception, and considering they have telescoped nearly two decades of this pursuit into less than three hours, Fincher and company have done so with energy and imagination.",5,I have to look him in the eye.....,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,3069,"['Why', 'response', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'frightened', 'increasingly', 'estranged', 'wife', 'above', 'statement', 'fixation', 'Why', 'indeed', 'just', 'newspapers', 'police', 'citizenry', 'Northern', 'California', 'had', 'been', 'siezed', 'terror', 'frustration', 'random', 'murders', 'perpetrated', 'elusive', 'self-proclaimed', 'Zodiac', 'Graysmith', 'interest', 'discovering', 'identity', 'turned', 'all-consuming', 'obsession', 'come', 'moment', 'only', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'leadup', 'been', 'fascinating', 'police', 'procedural', 'unfolding', 'same', 'mistaken', 'assumptions', 'false', 'leads', 'jurisdictional', 'problems', 'several', 'different', 'counties', 'investigations', 'proceeding', 'unknowing', 'parallel', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'occurred', 'real', 'case.I', 'say', 'fascinating', 'found', 'so', 'have', 'fondness', 'films', 'depicting', 'how', 'professionals', 'go', 'business', 'have', 'great', 'admiration', 'David', 'Fincher', 'exploration', 'day-to-day', 'wear', 'tear', 'involved', 'agonizingly', 'slow', 'painstaking', 'work', 'required', 'trying', 'capture', 'taunting', 'headline-hungry', 'cruel', 'despicable', 'monster', 'Zodiac', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'thriller', 'such', 'Fincher', 'own', '7even', 'should', 'give', 'pass', 'different', 'elements', 'here.It', 'long', 'film', '2-1/2', 'hrs', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'engrossed', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'film', 'remember', 'period', ""60's-70"", 'Fincher', 'evocation', 'San', 'Francisco', 'city', 'culture', 'then', 'spot', 'found', 'camera', 'perspectives', 'framing', 'coming', 'material', 'sorts', 'angles', 'high', 'low', 'around', 'far', 'smooth', 'fresh', 'style', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'detailed', 'intricate', 'telling', 'story', 'rather', 'it.The', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'departments', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'single', 'out', 'leads', 'true', 'ensemble', 'work', 'Let', 'just', 'echo', 'other', 'reviewers', 'stating', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'true-life', 'Inspector', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'modeled', 'Bullitt', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'less', 'colorful', 'solid', 'partner', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'flamboyant', 'talented', 'self-destructing', 'reporter', 'finally', 'Gyllenhaal', 'increasingly', 'compulsive', 'cartoonist', 'have', 'fine', 'scenes', 'well', 'done', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Chloe', 'Sevigney', 'Charles', 'Fleischer', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'do', 'solid', 'supporting', 'work.Working', 'factual', 'material', 'including', 'eponymous', 'book', 'Graysmith', 'ultimately', 'produced', 'case', 'Fincher', 'created', 'intricate', 'complex', 'look', 'spell', 'cast', 'vile', 'celebrity-seeking', 'notorious', 'monster/nobody', 'apprehension', 'always', 'just', 'reach', 'big', 'story', 'deftness', 'great', 'craft', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'film', 'everyone', 'was', 'one', 'end', 'Movies', 'are', 'as', 'long', 'need', 'be', 'one', 'exception', 'considering', 'have', 'telescoped', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'pursuit', 'less', 'three', 'hours', 'Fincher', 'company', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'energy', 'imagination']",N/A

1076696,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000QUCNOU,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","If you like detective stories, or investigation stories, this is the movie of the year. I may be biased, because I lived in San Francisco when the Zodiac resurfaced after years of silence, and when the book was written about it. This movie is a pretty darn accurate account of a true story.This is a story of obsession: the obsession of the Zodiac killer is one thing. The obsession of certain people who investigated the murders, especially the one who did not give up, and eventually wrote the book about it, is the other.It's not an unduly gory movie, really. There is blood, and there are killings, but they are not over-emphasized. It's just part of the story. There are the methods detectives use, and there are the methods reporters use, and the ways they work together, and the ways they conflict. Like when the cop who ""cannot discuss an open investigation"" with an investigative journalist (editorial cartoonist, originally) says ""So I can't tell you to go see so-and-so in Vallejo.""According to the movie, the cartoonist turned investigator lost his wife over his obsession with this case, and her fear that he was making himself a target for a killer. The reporter who got fired for drinking after he was threatened personally by Zodiac was the cartoonist's friend, and he eventually went completely down the tubes.The police did investigate the man who eventually turned out to be the Zodiac, interviewed him, searched his trailer and found some pretty good circumstantial evidence. But the handwriting expert cleared him, so they dropped him from their list of suspects, although at least one police investigator continued to consider him their best suspect. How the cartoonist eventually found the evidence that convinced him and the top cop on the investigation (after he was removed from the case) is the most fascinating part of the story. But still, it was circumstantial evidence, and the fact that one handwriting expert had cleared him stood in their way. Another said not to rule him out on the basis of handwriting analysis.Did you know the crime was never officially solved? It's pretty clear who did it, yes, but the evidence was not gathered that could officially charge him with it, and he died before he could be prosecuted.I was completely absorbed in this story, and recommend it to anyone who likes crime and detective stories",4,Very Well Done Telling of a True Story I Remember,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2358,"['like', 'detective', 'stories', 'investigation', 'stories', 'movie', 'year', 'may', 'be', 'biased', 'lived', 'San', 'Francisco', 'when', 'Zodiac', 'resurfaced', 'years', 'silence', 'when', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'movie', 'pretty', 'darn', 'accurate', 'account', 'true', 'story.This', 'story', 'obsession', 'obsession', 'Zodiac', 'killer', 'one', 'thing', 'obsession', 'certain', 'people', 'who', 'investigated', 'murders', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'eventually', 'wrote', 'book', 'other.It', 'not', 'unduly', 'gory', 'movie', 'really', 'blood', 'are', 'killings', 'are', 'not', 'over-emphasized', 'just', 'part', 'story', 'are', 'methods', 'detectives', 'use', 'are', 'methods', 'reporters', 'use', 'ways', 'work', 'together', 'ways', 'conflict', 'when', 'cop', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'discuss', 'open', 'investigation', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'editorial', 'cartoonist', 'originally', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'go', 'see', 'so-and-so', 'Vallejo', 'According', 'movie', 'cartoonist', 'turned', 'investigator', 'lost', 'wife', 'obsession', 'case', 'fear', 'was', 'making', 'target', 'killer', 'reporter', 'who', 'got', 'fired', 'drinking', 'was', 'threatened', 'personally', 'Zodiac', 'was', 'cartoonist', 'friend', 'eventually', 'went', 'completely', 'tubes.The', 'police', 'did', 'investigate', 'man', 'who', 'eventually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Zodiac', 'interviewed', 'searched', 'trailer', 'found', 'pretty', 'good', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'handwriting', 'expert', 'cleared', 'dropped', 'list', 'suspects', 'least', 'one', 'police', 'investigator', 'continued', 'consider', 'best', 'suspect', 'How', 'cartoonist', 'eventually', 'found', 'evidence', 'convinced', 'top', 'cop', 'investigation', 'was', 'removed', 'case', 'most', 'fascinating', 'part', 'story', 'still', 'was', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'fact', 'one', 'handwriting', 'expert', 'had', 'cleared', 'stood', 'way', 'said', 'not', 'rule', 'out', 'basis', 'handwriting', 'analysis.Did', 'know', 'crime', 'was', 'never', 'officially', 'solved', 'pretty', 'clear', 'who', 'did', 'yes', 'evidence', 'was', 'not', 'gathered', 'could', 'officially', 'charge', 'died', 'could', 'be', 'prosecuted.I', 'was', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'story', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'crime', 'detective', 'stories']",N/A

The blu ray presentation of ZODIAC is absolutely spectacular and everything that was great about this film is exemplified 100% as blu ray is used to its fullest effect.  This film has always been a 5 star outing for me.  It takes a new approach to true crime and instead follows the lengthy journey of police and reporters as they follow the leads and try to find the mysterious Zodiac killer.  The ensemble cast is exemplary with all doing some of their best work.  Some of the killings are shown and they are done without over the top gore.  Instead they are realistically shot which instills an even greater fear into the viewer.  When the killer approaches a couple and the woman exclaims ""He has a gun !!"" my insides quiver as if it was happening to me.The film manages to follow the history of the Zodiac's killings while being a police procedural and investigative piece all at the same time.  The viewer feels how each characters life is involved with and changed by this case.  There is trepidation, suspense and great drama with a superb script and amazing directing.Now, back to the blu ray version of this film.  This is a brand new release and I needed an update on my blu ray player to view it.  Very easy to do.  And the 1080 high def pic is striking.  The visual clarity is amazing and darks, brights, etc. are all excellent.  Day and night scenes are both just as vibrant.  And the 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio is amazing.  This seems to be a film basically dialogue driven but all 5 speakers are put to amazing use here.  The dialogue is totally crisp and this film also possesses an amazing score of 70s music. It comes from all the speakers as does city background noise.  All 5 speakers are continuously in use.  It is as if viewing the film for the 1st time and I was in awe.  This audion track makes the film a new experience.And for me this 2 disc Director's cut is the first blu ray to take advantage and provide exemplary special features.

It was worth the wait. Luckily, I had purchased a laptop with an HD-DVD player. Format wars aside, it is worth the price just for the extras included. The detectives and survivors will have you hanging on every word. The detectives go over crime scenes in pretty good detail telling of little things that still stick in their minds about the crime scenes. Every one of the suspected Zodiac killings are gone over in the documentary, including ones that were not recreated in the movie. The documentary also has photos that have probably never been seen before of evidence (that are new) as well as police shots of crime scenes. Interwoven into the documentary are old news clips of survivor interviews and police press conferences.  And victims look back and tell what happened and how it effected their lives over the years. Excellent, excellent production quality with state of the art graphics being used for recreations. Also this was the first high definition DVD of either Blue Ray or HD-DVD that I have seen were all the extra features were also in HD.For those that are interested in true crime, historical events, or the Zodiac (regardless of your theories on who he was)you need this in your DVD library if just for the documentaries (there is one also on the Zodiac's identity).

1076701,A3KUEXN9M9FOMH,B000QUCNOU,billy,"[5, 12]","David Fincher's Zodiac is really two movies.  The first is an intriguing story about the search for a feared serial killer who enjoys taunting the police with letters to newspapers and making idle threats to school children.  The second is a paranoid rat race involving Robert Graysmith's (Jake Glyllenhaal) frantic and obsessive search for the identity of the Zodiac killer.  The first movie is great, the second movie is tedious.Zodiac really starts off with a bang.  The opening scene shows two lovers cruising to a quiet spot while being followed by a mysterious car.  They pull up to a lovers lane area and the car that has been following them pulls up behind.  A man gets out with a flashlight attached to a gun and shots both of them.  The woman is killed, but the man survives.This scene sets the stage for the first half of Zodiac, which is filled with some brutal scenes of the killer taking his victims, the police frantically hunting the killer, and the members of the media trying to decipher the clues that the Zodiac sends them.  Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, and Glyllenhaal all put in some great performances.The frustration of the police and the reporters trying to capture Zodiac is palpable throughout the movie.  You feel bad for Detective Toschi (Ruffalo), and Paul Avary (Downey Jr.) because they want so badly to catch Zodiac, but he's always just out of reach.  There obsession to find Zodiac basically destroys the lives of everyone.  Toschi alienates his family and loses his job, Avary descends in to alcohol and drug addiction and loses his job, and Graysmith pushes his family away.  All of this is intriguing stuff.But then we get to the second half of the movie, which devolves from an interesting mystery to a mess of paranoid theories, red herrings, and tedious detective wankery.  The last hour or so of the movie is dedicated to Graysmith's personal obsession with Zodiac.  Graysmith hunts down every lead, no matter how far fetched, outlandish or crazy.  The audience is forced to sit and watch him search out every possible lead that he can, and it's kind of boring.  Every time Graysmith went after another lead, everyone in the theatre let out a groan, it was just too much.  It was overly complicated, and all of the names and facts were too hard to keep track off.  It felt like I needed a cliff notes version to read along with at the theatre.  There is nothing even close to a payoff.  I got the feeling that this movie could have gone on forever, with Graysmith chasing Zodiac until he died of old age on screen.I have a hard time recommending half of a good movie.  If you want to spend 10 bucks on half a good movie, then go right ahead.  You could probably walk out about half way through and not miss anything really important.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Fincher had put together a fascinating tale of determination / obsessive dedication in the face of mounting terror. ZODIAC starts off w/ a bang, showing us the maniac in action. The murders themselves are dealt with in quick succession, leaving the majority of the film to decyphering Zodiac's codes, gathering evidence, and interviewing suspects. I love police procedurals (Forensic Files is one of my favorite TV shows), so this movie held my interest throughout. However, ZODIAC is also about the effects of such a baffling, frustratingly drawn-out case on those who relentlessly pursue it. We watch as the characters' lives are nearly consumed by Zodiac to the point of their own ruin. Jake Gyllenhaal's cartoonist character goes from being interested in the case to being taken over by it. He will not rest or stop until Zodiac's identity is revealed. I could feel his obsession grow! Mark Ruffalo is the cop who runs down leads and ultimately gives up hope (almost) entirely. Watching these two is an amazing study in doggedness and dedication. These are the guys I want working on these types of cases! At the same time, we also get a look at the tremendous toll taken. The simple things in life that are missed. The price that is paid in mental / physical burn-out, lost opportunities, and personal relationships altered or destroyed. ZODIAC reminds us that life is precious, and that obsession, even well-placed obsession, will drain our souls.

1076707,A1PYZWEC4SCUB8,B000QUCNOU,Book N Film Fan,"[3, 3]","It seems like a lot of serial killers sprang up in the 1960s/70s. The Boston Strangler, Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, and The Hillside Stranglers all brought fright and terror to their cities. One of the more bizarre serial killers was The Zodiac, who operated in the San Francisco area beginning in 1968. The film ''Zodiac'' focuses on the events surrounding his killings and how the case drove one man following the case nearly out of his mind.In the movie the Zodiac killer begins his murder spree by shooting some young couples then eventually striking right in the heart of San Francisco. He then taunts the San Francisco Chronicle's staff with cryptic letters and proof that he knew secret details about the gruesome murders. The paper's cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal) becomes obsessed with the case, along with the lead journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.)As the case progresses Downey's character becomes overwhelmed by personal demons and police make little progress in finding the killer. But Graysmith continues to hunt for clues, even as the killings stop and life moves on. Eventually Graysmith alienates everyone around him, annoys the police, and develops unsubstantiated theories about the Zodiac's identity, but a great personal cost.The film has some good performances by Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo as one of the detectives, and Chloe Sevigny as Graysmith's wife.

Two obsessions ,really, one the story of a person with a obsession for killing and the second of the police and journalists on an obsessive quest for the truth.Zodiac is a departure from normal Fincher fare. The film is more a tight police procedural than a gory serial killer film. The story is the stuff of urban legend and needs no real explanation. The three principal leads in the film Jake Gyllenhaal as cartoonist Robert Graysmith,  Mark Rufallo as Inspector David Toschi and Robert Downey, Jr. as reporter Paul Avery are excellent. The film offers insights into all of its characters great and small that are not usually found in films of this type. We go on an emotional ride with these people and begin to care about what the strain of the case is doing to them both professionally and personally.Fincher has always been a director for creating atmosphere ans Zodiac is no different.  Using cinematographer Harris Savides and production designer Donald Graham Burt he effectively recreates late 1960's/ early 1970's San Francisco without ever going over the top. Writer James Vanderbilt provides a complex screenplay that keeps you guessing throughout. There are more false leads and red herrings here for a film twice its length.If there is a problem with this film it's that Paramount has decided to release a bare bones edition of the film but promises a new bonus filled Director's Edition early in 2008. Having this trailer on the film feels like a slap in the face to those of us who bought the early edition.This is one of the better and more intelligent films of the year thus far and deserves a look.

We know going in that the case of the Zodiac Killer was never solved so basically this is a movie about people looking for something they're never going to find. And I don't know how you define dull? But for me, that's right up there. The performances are all fine. Jake Gyllenhaal is good, Anthony Edwards is good, Robert Downey Jr is always good. And the movie has a nice dark authentic look to it. The trouble is, it's just not scary. David Fincher stays true to his material here and, while that's admirable, it means that we never see the killer, never get into his head and never come to understand his need to kill. So what we're left with is simply a shadowy figure with a gun. A cardboard cutout of a killer. And while if you actually lived through the Zodiac era, that uncertainty, the knowledge that anyone you pass on the street might in fact have blood on his hands might be terrifying, that terror doesn't transfer to the screen. This film received a lot of praise when it came out and was nominated for several awards (Jake Gyllenhaal: ""Teen Choice Award"" for Actor: Horror/Thriller?) and maybe as a sort of documentary it deserved it.

So much so that it wasn't uncommon to ask someone's sign when first meeting them. The Zodiac killer filled the news especially on the West coast for some time. Between his grisly murder methods and the police's inability to stop him, the general public was in a state of disbelief. This follows the case closely from many perspectives. The acting is superb with excellent performances by Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr., Mike Ruffalo, and the rest the cast. When I first heard about this movie I wasn't interested because many movies like this try so hard to be factual they lose the realism.This movie does an excellent job of giving facts from the case, but making you feel you were there. The acting, directing, sets, and music all make it seem as though you have travelled back in time to those moments in history around this one baffling case. I'm glad I took a chance when a rental store employee recommended it. I ended up buying it because it is thrilling and interesting to see how the police tracked him down after years of his killings and cryptic torment.

1076718,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B000QUCNOU,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[9, 14]","Most people know who Steven Speilberg and George Lucas are. Following directors such as them became commonplace back in the 70s when they brought us such blockbusters as Jaws and Star Wars. Now following the works of directors has become a bit more normal, not for everyone perhaps, but as any modern film buff will tell you following Tom Cruise will get you no where. Rarely do actors tend to consistently choose films with such distinct sensibilities as the singular vision directors tend to have. It has been said, by whom I do not remember, that directors keep making the same film over and over. If you look at George Lucas that pretty much seems to be the case. Stanley Kubrick perhaps not so much. Still, even with Kubrick eventually the term Kubrickian evolved to represent films by others that tended to remind us of what he had imparted through his works. I'm going somewhere with all this...With David Fincher, who many filmgoers may not know, there is definitely a distinct sensibility that he has that bleeds through to us with each new film he makes. Since Panic Room there has been a 5 year lull. 5 years is a long time to wait for a new film from a director. I will spare you the suspense and tell you that Zodiac was well worth the wait. The film is masterfully created and could not have been pulled off by anyone but him. There is already a film called The Zodiac that was made a few years back by. I saw that film and it was  a train wreck at best. Finchers Zodiac is almost 3 hours long, yet manages with far less overt uses of the modern scare tactics that have become so common, to keep the audience gripped and engaged.Now for anyone who does not want to read a spoiler do not read on. I am however not spoiling much in saying that the real life zodiac killer was never caught. That may even be revealed in the trailer, I forget. For a film with no killer caught, and no real resolution, it would seem to be a film not worth making. David Fincher manages to make you forget the killer was never caught. He also manages to give real and tangible suspense without having a cat jump out of a dark corner to shock the audience in lue of real filmmaking. Even compared to his earlier works which smacked of his MTV origins this film is much more subtle. You will not find the visceral twisted alien like den of the killer. This film is much more real and human far less surreal and inhuman than his earlier films. The real life conversations, vices, obsessions, sounds, images, and killings, produce a film that lets real every day terror seep into you as you watch it.

1076719,AKV2BGUT50B1X,B000QUCNOU,Carl Robinson,"[1, 2]","Zodiac is a fascinating movie that portrays the Zodiac Killer's reign of terror over the San Francisco in the late 1960's and early 1970s.  Every scene is carefully made.  Cars are the right models for the time, TV's, phones, and radios reflect the technology of the day, even the contemporary-to-the-timeframe of the movie public's ignorance of crime is shockingly displayed when a young mother pulls over on a dark road due after the Zodiac lures her to stop.The movie's imagery during the Zodiac's spree is shockingly dark.  The lighting, music, and scenes are suspenseful and excellently done.  The hot search for the killer draws the viewer in.However, the movie follows the truth of the actual Zodiac killer's story.  It is anti-climatic.  The Zodiac has never been caught.  The case is beyond cold and moving into the status of folk legend.  Interesting enough, it seems that the late 1960's through to the middle 1970s is a time in which highly intelligent criminals out-maneuvered the police.  Along with the Zodiac Killer, D.B. Cooper (hijacking 1971) has likewise never been found.

Then there's the fact that the person who is obsessed is one of my favorite younger actors, Jake Gyllenhall. He plays a cartoonist with a San Francisco newspaper who wants to find the serial killer, the Zodiac.  Everyone else involved in it gives up as the Zodiac has a way of disappearing. Although the Zodiac's killings are especially gruesome, the movie is really not about the murders as it is about the obsession to uncover him.  I think there is something especially galling about a serial murderer who just dies a regular death and is never brought to justice.  The suspect the cartoonist focuses upon goes exactly down that road.  Yet it is not at all certain that he was the Zodiac.  All that's known is that he has been gone for a long, long time and is probably dead since his murders started forty years ago.  The supporting cast is stellar too, Mark Ruffalo as the cop, Robert Downey Jr. as a reporter and host of others.  It's in one and the same moment an absolutely chilling case yet also a world class frustrating case.  Just about everyone who was professionally involved in this case became a victim to it as well.  It just tore every person apart as it unravelled them instead of vice versa.  There are two killings which you won't be able to forget.

1076721,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000QUCNOU,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 1]","Zodiac is an excellent movie that is successful on many levels. First, it tells a true-life crime story about a sensational serial murderer that galvanized the public, and was ultimately never solved. Second, it tells how the author of the book upon which the film was based was caught up in trying to solve the case while working as a cartoonist at The San Francisco Chronicle. Third, it tells the devastating effect this had on him and his family, and also on the police and reporters and their families. Fourth, it questions the role of media in cases like this--does the press coverage reward the killers with fame and notoriety? Does the press help or hinder the police? Fifth, it shows the need for different police jurisdictions to collaborate and share information.To accomplish these various goals it had a tight ensemble cast led by Jake Gylenhaal as Robert Graysmith; with strong performances from Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery, a reprobate reporter; Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi, a police detective assigned to the case; Chlo Sevigny, as Graysmith's long suffering wife; Jimmi Simpson (Lyle the Intern on Letterman), as one of Zodiac's surviving victims; along with Anthony Edwards (ER), Dermot Mulroney (The Thing Called Love), James LeGros (Bad Girls), Candy Clark (American Graffiti), and John Carroll Lynch.Special effects were used unobtrusively to enhance the film without distracting from the story, for instance, when they were unable to film on a particular street in San Francisco, they filmed on a soundstage, but dropped the actual street in as background, blending it flawlessly. Another establishing shot shows the Transamerica Pyramid being built with time-lapse photography. Though some special effects were used, they never got in the way.The film had a very realistic look. Scenes in the Chronicle were exactly as I remembered the place. All the locations looked totally accurate. As the film was based on real events, there was meticulous attention to detail. Though the friendship between Paul Avery and Graysmith was fictionalized, there is a disclaimer that informs the viewer of that fact. From that I gathered that most of the other details, the ones that pertained to the Zodiac murders, were very accurate. This is so important in this sort of true crime story because  a man is being accused of murder. The filmmakers are presenting a case, though largely circumstantial, that a man is guilty of multiple murders. The temptation for the filmmakers is to fabricate evidence, in the name of poetic license, or just to make a more compelling film. All the loose ends must be tied up before we can roll credits.------------------------------Robert Graysmith: Just because you can't prove it doesn't mean it isn't true.Dave Toschi: Easy, Dirty Harry.==============Graysmith also wrote a book about the unsolved murder of Robert Crane. That book was also made into a movie--called Auto Focus, and directed by Paul Schrader. That book also presented a suspect that the author believed had done the crime, though in the case of Robert Crane there was finally a trial where the man Graysmith suspected was charged. After so many years, it was hard to find evidence or credible witnesses. He was found not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. As for Zodiac, you'll just have to watch the film, as I am not about to spoil the film by revealing the ending.The bottom line is Zodiac was a very good film that accomplished what it set out to do. It didn't dwell on the violence, but showed just enough to tell the story. It presented a very solid case for the identity of Zodiac, but didn't seem to manufacture evidence out of whole cloth. The story was just as much about what Graysmith, the reporters, and the police went through to keep their families together and not go insane as it was about the puzzle of solving a murder mystery. It also raised provocative questions about the role of media in reporting crimes. That it managed to do all this wisely and fairly and still be entertaining is quite an accomplishment.-------------------Robert Graysmith: I... I Need to know who he is. I...

1076723,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B000QUCNOU,Chris Luallen,"[3, 3]","Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who, along with crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr), becomes obsessed with tracking down the Zodiac killer after he begins to send coded messages to the newspaper. The film opens with a brutal murder of two young lovers in 1969 and spans well into the 70's, as police detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and others join Graysmith and Avery in the search for the serial killer.The first half of the film depicts a series of grisly murders committed by the Zodiac mixed in with some rather superfluous scenes, such as Graysmith's first date with the woman who later became his wife. Some of the crime scenes are intense and well put together. But overall I felt like this part of the movie lacked suspense and was basically just one murder after another with few opportunites for the viewer to play ""amateur detective.""I enjoyed the second half of the movie more, as Graysmith, Toschi and others began to investigate the evidence and check out possible suspects, including an ex-teacher, child molester named Arthur Leigh. I starting losing empathy for Graysmith towards the end as he gives up his wife and children in order to continue his obsessive search for the Zodiac. The fact that Graysmith did eventually achieve a certain degree of fame and fortune from writing his book on the Zodiac also makes me a little skeptical of his motives. But the movie really downplays that angle and makes Graysmith seem like an entirely altruistic figure.The film trots out several names of potential suspects but leaves the viewer with a final impression that the despicable Artur Leigh was the likely killer. Of course, the case was never solved so we will likely never know for sure. This is a fairly entertaining movie with some good acting. But it was a bit overlong and could have benefitted from some better editing.

1076724,A18D0R137EYS6C,B000QUCNOU,Clinton Enlow,"[10, 12]","I'll admit that I'm one of the people who really didn't care much for Zodiac as much as others. As a film its a wearing experience that goes very slowly showing the reality of the case itself. Investigators gather clues, recieve letters from the Killer. There are false leads from grandstanders seeking attention and slowly the obsession builds in the three investigators, reporters Paul Avery and Robert Graysmith and detective Dave Toschi. Its not a film with any real closure for what the killings (which are some of the most brutal on screen without any gore or very little blood) just an idea that lead to a dead end with the death of the main suspect Arthur Leigh Allan. I saw it in a quiet theatre and enjoyed most of the scenes minus one where a false lead to Graysmith leads him to the basement of a creepy film buff that doesn't pan out in the end. Its an intensely suspensful moment but in theatres it felt like padding on a three hour run time that grated on my patience. Still the procedural details do fascinate me and the film plays better in a home setting to me where the viewer can stand in stretch so they're not immobile for three hours. Theres humor from Downey Jr. and Gyllenhalls interactions with each other, Fincher shows his visual flare but in a somewhat more subdued method (one method of misdirection is that three different actors play the killer in the murder scenes). And in the end you can become engaged with the obsession of wondering who the killer was.I do have to say though that the Zodiac Directors Cut does fit with one of those great things about DVD. This set fits like other disc sets like the special editions of Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor or the Kingdom of Heaven Directors cut in that not only do you get a special edition of the film but the features figure in heavy to the real history of the story. On the first disc you have two great commentaries from David Fincher and a group commentary from the actors, producer Brad Fischer, writer James Vanderbilt and crime fiction writer James Ellroy who steals the track with his bravado. On the second disc you have some great making of material but a split up documentary on the Zodiac murders themselves with detectives and victim Bryan Hartnell who provides a great commentary on the Barryessa killing. and a great one on prime suspect Arthur Allan Leigh where it talks to friends and investigators giving background on why Allan might have been the killer. The thing about this one is while they spend half an hour outlining why Allan might have been Zodiac from evidence and victim Mageau pointing his picture out of a lineup, theres two professors who shoot down easily why all this conjecture might be false why all of the evidence can be tied by the tenous of strands without being really hard fact.

1076725,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000QUCNOU,"Cloud ""...""","[6, 7]","Last time director David Fincher did a film about a serial killer, he made what's right in my top 5 favorite films ever with Seven. But instead of revisiting the genre with the same approach, Zodiac takes on a different mood as well as a more serious approach. Whereas films like Panic Room and Fight Club had visual trickery and cameras going into flashbulb filaments, Zodiac is more restrained, more depth-filled and in the end better because of it. It's just too bad he's not as prolific since he hasn't made a single bad film ever and Zodiac is just another great entry into an impressive career.Taking place during the late 1960's and the bulk of the 70's, the film follows real-life San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith, fellow employee and friend Paul Avery and cops Dave Toschi and Bill Armstrong track down the mysterious and elusive Zodiac Killer, responsible for several murders. But Zodiac is different in that he actually writes letters to newspaper offices and leaves clues and strange symbols meant to be decoded. But trying to find out the identity, as well as determine the pattern is proving frustrating as Graysmith, Avery and Toschi find themselves more and more obsessed with figuring out who is the Zodiac.With Seven, we followed 2 detectives who were always one step behind the killer but in the game long enough to know and decipher the clues so it became more cat-and-mouse. Zodiac on the other hand is more procedural and that it's more about that frustration when things aren't happening quick enough and the answers are nowhere to be found, let alone can be figured out. One might not like the shift though since at a certain point we see less murder scenes and less Zodiac appearances and it becomes more about the obsession that takes over, particularly strong with Graysmith. But it's often been said that the mark of a great director is when he's given a bad script or premise and makes it a good movie. Fincher, who in my opinion hasn't even made a dud yet (and yes I'm including Alien3 with this) has already proven himself but here he takes the idea of a serial killer movie, one of the most formulaic genres there is next to horror and romantic comedies and makes it fascinating the entire way through.But a film is also in the hands of the actors and thankfully we have 3 great leads with all 3 of them being incredibly nuanced and strong in their performances. We also get cameos from John Carroll Lynch (the guy who get melted in Volcano, Frances McDormand's husband in Fargo) as Arthur Allen Leigh, Clea Duvall and Charles Fleischer, a.k.a the voice of Roger Rabbit, who has probably the creepiest scene in the entire film. One thing I should address as well is its length. No it's not near 3 hours since people exaggerate and assume many people don't hit the stop button when the credits roll. It's 2 and a half hours long but thanks to Fincher it never feels like it. But when it comes to long running times, there's 2 trains of thought: it's either too long for its own good and it's almost an indulgent length (the recent King Kong, the Holiday) and there's this film where it's long because it needs to be since there's so much story that needs telling.The DVD's (besides the Game which STILL doesn't have a region 1 special edition) from David Fincher have always been stellar from informative commentaries to behind the scenes footage. So the double dip that will happen is all the more disappointing. Did they not get things done in time? Make more money by making you buy the completely bare-bones edition and the special edition next year? You wish there was at least something on this but save your money unless you absolutely have to have this.Too bad it didn't make a huge dent at the box office but that's beside the point. Audiences know a good movie when they see it whether DVD or theatre and Zodiac is just as good a movie as people say it is and even a bit more.",5,One of my favorite films of this year,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,3936,"['Last', 'time', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'did', 'film', 'serial', 'killer', 'made', 'what', 'right', 'top', '5', 'favorite', 'films', 'ever', 'Seven', 'instead', 'revisiting', 'genre', 'same', 'approach', 'Zodiac', 'different', 'mood', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'serious', 'approach', 'Whereas', 'films', 'Panic', 'Room', 'Fight', 'Club', 'had', 'visual', 'trickery', 'cameras', 'going', 'flashbulb', 'filaments', 'Zodiac', 'more', 'restrained', 'more', 'depth-filled', 'end', 'better', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'prolific', ""n't"", 'made', 'single', 'bad', 'film', 'ever', 'Zodiac', 'just', 'great', 'entry', 'impressive', 'career.Taking', 'place', 'late', '1960', 'bulk', '70', 'film', 'real-life', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'fellow', 'employee', 'friend', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'cops', 'Dave', 'Toschi', 'Bill', 'Armstrong', 'track', 'down', 'mysterious', 'elusive', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'responsible', 'several', 'murders', 'Zodiac', 'different', 'actually', 'letters', 'newspaper', 'offices', 'clues', 'strange', 'symbols', 'meant', 'be', 'decoded', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'identity', 'as', 'well', 'determine', 'pattern', 'proving', 'frustrating', 'Graysmith', 'Avery', 'Toschi', 'find', 'more', 'more', 'obsessed', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'Zodiac.With', 'Seven', 'followed', '2', 'detectives', 'who', 'were', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'killer', 'game', 'long', 'enough', 'know', 'decipher', 'clues', 'became', 'more', 'cat-and-mouse', 'Zodiac', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'procedural', 'more', 'frustration', 'when', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'happening', 'quick', 'enough', 'answers', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'let', 'alone', 'can', 'be', 'figured', 'out', 'One', 'might', 'not', 'shift', 'certain', 'point', 'see', 'less', 'murder', 'scenes', 'less', 'Zodiac', 'appearances', 'more', 'obsession', 'particularly', 'strong', 'Graysmith', 'often', 'been', 'said', 'mark', 'great', 'director', 'when', 'given', 'bad', 'script', 'premise', 'good', 'movie', 'Fincher', 'who', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'even', 'made', 'dud', 'yet', 'yes', ""'m"", 'including', 'Alien3', 'already', 'proven', 'here', 'idea', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'formulaic', 'genres', 'next', 'horror', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'fascinating', 'entire', 'way', 'film', 'also', 'hands', 'actors', 'thankfully', 'have', '3', 'great', 'leads', '3', 'being', 'incredibly', 'nuanced', 'strong', 'performances', 'also', 'get', 'cameos', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'guy', 'who', 'get', 'melted', 'Volcano', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'husband', 'Fargo', 'Arthur', 'Allen', 'Leigh', 'Clea', 'Duvall', 'Charles', 'Fleischer', 'voice', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'who', 'probably', 'creepiest', 'scene', 'entire', 'film', 'One', 'thing', 'should', 'address', 'well', 'length', 'not', '3', 'hours', 'people', 'exaggerate', 'assume', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'stop', 'button', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'thanks', 'Fincher', 'never', 'when', 'long', 'running', 'times', '2', 'trains', 'thought', 'too', 'long', 'own', 'good', 'almost', 'indulgent', 'length', 'recent', 'King', 'Kong', 'Holiday', 'film', 'where', 'long', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'telling.The', 'DVD', 'Game', 'STILL', ""n't"", 'have', 'region', '1', 'special', 'edition', 'David', 'Fincher', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'stellar', 'informative', 'commentaries', 'behind', 'scenes', 'footage', 'double', 'dip', 'will', 'happen', 'more', 'disappointing', 'Did', 'not', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'time', 'Make', 'more', 'money', 'making', 'buy', 'completely', 'bare-bones', 'edition', 'special', 'edition', 'year', 'wish', 'was', 'least', 'something', 'save', 'money', 'absolutely', 'have', 'have', 'this.Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'huge', 'dent', 'box', 'office', 'beside', 'point', 'Audiences', 'know', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'see', 'DVD', 'theatre', 'Zodiac', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'people', 'say', 'even', 'bit', 'more']",N/A

1076727,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B000QUCNOU,C. Middleton,"[0, 1]","It was exciting news to discover that David Fincher, director of such films as Fight Club, Panic Room, The Game and the masterpiece, Se7en was the director of the film Zodiac, the serial killer (publicly claimed 13 victims, police pinned him to five) who sent codes and frightening notes to major newspapers during the late sixties and seventies and, strangely was never apprehended. Zodiac is a very good film but unfortunately not one of Fincher's best.The film is based on the best selling book by Robert Graysmith and the author is played in the film with skill by actor Jake Gyllenhaal. The character of Graysmith is portrayed as a bookish, stumbling nerd-type though as the film progresses; the character becomes obsessed with solving or identifying the Zodiac killer, and with this growing obsession becomes much more confident. Gyllenhaal (Rendition, Jarhead, and Broken Mountain) is a fine actor and played this character with subtlety and believability - a great performance.Robert Downey Junior as the chain smoking hard drinking rebellious journalist, Paul Avery, seemed to be a step down for this fine actor. If this isn't type casting, then I don't know what is...Downey's personal life has been rough, some would say unfair, but as his agent, I would have suggested he turn down this role merely because he has played this ""type"" many times, however he does it very well and to work with Fincher would be hard to resist.The role of Inspector Toschi was superbly played by Mark Ruffalo (Collateral, In the Cut) and was certainly up to this actors high standards.As said many times, it is a mistake to walk into a film with any expectations, because one way or another, they'll be dashed in some respect.David Fincher is famous (some would say infamous) for his attention to detail, this film is no different. But it lacked, for me, that intense atmosphere which most of his other films have: Se7en, Fight Club and Panic Room.

1076728,A1WZY120DYDGO5,B000QUCNOU,"Collin D. Freeman ""collin_normal64""","[5, 5]","After reading many of the reviews posted for this film, it probably can be safely said movie-watchers will fall into 2 categories: loved it or hated it.  Oddly enough, I am probably one of the few exceptions to that observation.  I found the film to be excellent in many respects, but I can see why many a paying-movie-goer would feel cheated or disappointed.If you don't already know this movie is about the infamous Zodiac serial killer of northern California from the late 1960's-early 1970's, then you need to do some homework.  Even if you are only somewhat familiar with the case, I suggest you do some reading (book or web) to become more familiar with it, as I did, and that might enhance your viewing experience when watching this film.First, this is not a serial-killer thriller.  If you are or were somehow led to believe that it was a hacker-slasher film because of the director or a preview clip, then you are going to be disappointed.  Think ""All the President's Men"", not ""Saw"", ""Seven"", or ""Friday the 13th"".  Only a few of the incidents attributed to the killer are shown on camera, and then, most of the violence is left to the imagination of the audience.  This film is more of a documentary, or docu-drama, than a neatly written story that has a beginning and ending.  As in real life, there is no ending to this film.  The case is still unsolved and occasionally gets changed to inactive status, only to be reopened at some point.  Many movie-goers may find that aspect of unfulfillment frustrating, but it's real life.  So deal.Second, the film is very much from the book by Robert Graysmith, portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal.  It leads you down a path that unfortunately almost forces the audience to believe that a prime suspect was in fact the Zodiac killer, but because of screwed up police politics and the system they simply could not make a case stick.  This man (Arthur Leigh Allen), although a very good suspect on paper based on circumstantial evidence, was never even tried for any of the murders attributed to the Zodiac and has long since died of natural causes.  Again, an unfulfilled feeling by the time the movie ends.  (The actor playing Allen, however, does look remarkably like the real Leigh Allen.  Another gold star to David Fincher for authenticity.)Third, although somewhat flawed, Zodiac does do a remarkable job of recreating actual people with their real names (unlike an earlier low-budget film, The Zodiac), real locations, real events pretty much as they happened.  The people involved in this case over the years, and as they are portrayed on film, is the real reason to see this movie.  It is an acting tour-de-force!  Such authenticity, not only in the locations and events, but also in who was involved and what they went through are true character studies.  To see how this case changed lives (and not for the better) through losses of reputations, jobs, marriages, and health while a small handful of people lost their physical lives is what makes the film worth seeing. Robert Downey Jr should at least get a nomination for his portrayal as San Francisco crime reporter Paul Avery.  Major kudos to the rest of the cast, too, especially Mark Ruffalo as detective Dave Toschi and Brian Cox who gets to ham it up as famous celebrity defense attorney Melvin Belli (listen for the part about him discussing his role on Star Trek as the Gorgon).Side note of trivia: actor Philip Baker Hall is the only actor to have appeared in the 2006 film ""The Zodiac"" and this film, ""Zodiac"", although he plays 2 totally different people.Fourth, yes, it can certainly be supported that Zodiac is too long of a film, regardless of which side of the fence you stand.  I did not realize it was almost 3 hours by the time the end credits started to roll, but then, I know a fair amount about this case and was intrigued the entire way of how each person involved acted or reacted to each bit of evidence and each twist and turn.  I think it could have been trimmed by about 15 minutes or so for the general public, but it is what it is, and I do not consider it's length to be a major flaw, only a minor one.One final flaw I do have to mention is by using Graysmith's book as the primary source of material, the viewers are led to believe Allen was the killer.  The case is still unsolved, Allen has been removed as the prime suspect by many investigators due to contradictory physical evidence (no DNA match from the letters, no match on the fingerprint from the cab, handwriting was inconclusive, physical description does not match the man the police saw the night Paul Stine was killed, and the one known surviving victim could not say with 100% certainty it was Allen).  Hence, a greater feeling of unfulfillment by letting the audience believe that everyone involved knew Leigh Allen was the killer, they just couldn't bring him to justice.It's a fascinating case and can draw you in much like Jack-the-Ripper has done over the centuries.  And like Jack the Ripper, many people have theories and prime suspects but the killer is never found.  David Fincher, the cast, and the rest of the crew are to be commended for their honest and riveting portrayal of a time and place that affected more lives than just the ones the Zodiac killed.  If Zodiac falls short, it is only in the expectations of its viewers.  See it or not, it's up to you.  But don't say I didn't warn you.",4,Thriller or Docu-drama?

1076729,AQVBOVE8P7K3J,B000QUCNOU,Condor Libros,"[0, 0]","As of 2011, this film is David Fincher's best work as a director. He's always been a master of visual style and had made good films before this pic (I would argue that even his one outright failure - ""Alien 3"" - has one or two interesting qualities), but ""Zodiac"" marks the first time that he completely, and successfully, combined that serious visual pizzaz with serious material in a fully adult, thoughtful manner. ""Panic Room"" and ""The Game"" were fun, paranoid thrillers, but that was really all that they were. ""Fight Club"" tried to be a satire on the emptiness of modern materialism, but its approach often felt a little too flippant and nihilistic. Only ""Seven"" came close to being fully adult, but even it occasionally mistook nihilism for profundity. But then came ""Zodiac."" Although it contains elements of the thriller and pot boiler genres (serial killers, cops, and hard drinking newsmen), Fincher slows the pace down and dares to observe the very real effects that one long-term criminal investigation had on its participants. It's a thoughtful film - morally complex and ambiguous without being ambivalent - with fine performances by the principles and the supporting cast. And though the film is more slowly paced than Fincher's earlier work it isn't even close to being glacial.

1076730,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B000QUCNOU,Craig Connell,"[5, 5]","A couple of years ago, I read an article about how some people are still obsessed with the Zodiac serial killer case. Since the murderer was never apprehended, this case has fascinated a number of people for almost 40 years. There are websites and all kinds of people, apparently, who can't let go of this famous case.Lo and behold - here's a movie about that obsession. I, probably like a number of viewers, thought this was just another film about the murderer, and it looked that way for the first hour of the 157-minute movie. However, it turns out be just as much a story about one guy who has this obsession about finding the killer. That man is ""Robert Graysmith,"" a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle. He is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is based on Graysmith's books on the Zodiac killer, so it's no surprise the story winds up revolving around him.For moviegoers looking for a hard-nosed, brutal serial-killer story, this must have been a disappointing film because it turns out to be a character study of ""Graysmith"" plus an in- depth behind-the-scenes look at police procedure which, as any cop could tell you, can be tedious work. However, there is still is enough violence and suspense, particularly early on, to satisfy some and there is a lot of information on the crimes itself, and a lot of suspects to entertain the ""whodunit"" mystery-solving viewer.

1076733,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000QUCNOU,Cubist,"[142, 148]","After the technically accomplished but ultimately hollow thrillerPanic Room (3-Disc Special Edition), director David Fincher returns to familiar subject matter with Zodiac, a dramatization of the murders perpetuated by the infamous serial killer known as Zodiac that terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. WithSeven (New Line Platinum Series), Fincher seems like an obvious choice to direct this film but those of you expecting a rehash of that film will be disappointed. With Zodiac, he faces the daunting challenge of making an exciting thriller that runs two hours and forty minutes long where the killer was never caught. He does this by focusing on the people who investigated the case and how it affected them.This is a film that shows people talking and doing research - hardly, dynamic, cinematic material but Fincher makes it fascinating with strong performances from his talented cast and a solid screenplay to anchor the film. Like Michael Mann's equally obsessive serial killer movie,Manhunter (Restored Director's Cut Divimax Edition), Fincher spends a lot of his movie showing offices buzzing with activity as the case heats up and we see people hard at work as the police, FBI, the Chronicle and even the CIA all try to decipher the Zodiac's code and solve the case. He also show the minutia of their methods while also reminding us of the limits of technology at the time (no personal computers, no internet, no DNA testing, etc.). These people faced a monumental task of sifting through hundreds of false leads and crank calls from the substantial information that might actually further the case.Zodiac presents a wealth of information and invites you to sift through it like the three protagonists. In fact, there is so much to absorb that repeated viewings will undoubtedly reveal more details that might not have been caught upon an initial viewing. The film's long running time allows you to gradually immerse yourself in the film and the story it tells. However, it never feels too long because Fincher maintains a brisk, efficient pace cramming as much detail and information as he can into every scene. The killer is a fascinating enigma and his encrypted letters, his blatant taunting of the police, and the discrepancies between murders only it makes it more interesting. It is easy to see why people became obsessed with this case. Ultimately, the Zodiac case doesn't just leave a trail of actual bodies but also collateral damage in the form of failed marriages, ended partnerships and substance abuse. And this is just the people who investigated the case. The toll taken on the victims who survived, their families and those of the people who were killed is inconceivable. A whole other movie could be made about them. Fincher has made a smart, engaging thriller that suggests a new direction for the filmmaker, one that places an emphasis on character and story instead of atmosphere and set design.Last year, Paramount released an obligatory bare bones DVD and in the meantime, Fincher and DVD producer extraordinaire, David Prior have assembled an in-depth two-disc special edition that covers all aspects of the production. The director has also added five minutes back into the film that improves on an already great motion picture.The first disc features an audio commentary by director David Fincher. He touches upon the ""oddly personal"" period details as much of the film takes place during his childhood and around areas he lived. This also informed the period songs he picked for the film. This is the kind of engaging, informative track we've come to expect from Fincher.Even better is the second commentary by actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr., producer Brad Fischer, screenwriter James Vanderbilt, and crime novelist James Ellroy. Fischer and Vanderbilt talk about how closely they stuck to the actual facts of the case and delve into its details. Ellroy, a self-proclaimed fan of the film, does his entertaining Demon Dog of crime fiction persona that fans of his love while also talking about the film's place in crime fiction. Downey and Gyllenhaal provide all kinds of anecdotal information with Downey displaying his trademark dry sense of humour.The second disc is broken up into two sections: extras dealing with the film and ones dealing with the actual Zodiac murders. ""Zodiac Deciphered"" is an hour-long documentary on the making of the film. Producer Brad Fischer and screenwriter James Vanderbilt talk about the origins of the project. We see how each of the film's key locations were faithfully recreated, often shooting at the place where one of the murders took place. Period costumes were authentically recreated from police reports and evidence photographs. When actual locations could not be used, the San Francisco Chronicle offices, they were built from scratch on a soundstage. Fincher nailed the newspaper office down to the tiniest details like vintage rotary phones, typewriters, etc. There is plenty of on-the-set footage that shows Footage and co. at work.""The Visual Effects of Zodiac"" takes a look at how CGI was used not only to recreate certain period details of San Francisco but also the blood in the murder scenes. We see before and after comparison shots and it is incredible how seamlessly the effects are integrated into the film.The ""Previsualization"" for three scenes compares the computer animated storyboards with the final product in the film.Also included is a theatrical trailer.""This is the Zodiac Speaking"" is a four-part documentary on the actual Zodiac murders, featuring interviews with original investigators and the surviving victims. These featurettes present the facts of each murder along with crime scene photographs and vintage TV news footage, taking us through each one in detail.Finally, there is ""His Name was Arthur Leigh Allen."" Police investigators and people that knew him talk about the prime suspect in the Zodiac murders. Friends recount chilling anecdotes about the man and investigators provide their own accounts to paint a disturbing portrait.",5,This Director's Cut Special Edition was worth the wait,1199664000,"01

Even more so, coming from the director of ""Se7en"". What most of them probably forgot that he was also responsible for 1999's most cerebral film: Fight Club.As the tagline goes: There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer. It perhaps sums up the whole thesis or gist of the film. Even though this film is about the elusive Zodiac killings that plagued San Fransisco in the late 60s, well into the 70s; it is actually a by-the-book standard procedural investigative drama. It is not so much of a murder mystery that every Agatha Christie's fans will be anticipating. Even though the real identity of Zodiac remains the ""Macguffin"" of the whole movie.This film is broken down into 3 main acts. The first act consist of flamboyant journalist, Paul Avery, played with equal flamboyance by ex-alcoholic Robert Downey Jr., whose initial disinterest and outward passiveness hides a dark and unhealthy obsession over the killings and the killer himself. Interestingly, the film managed to hide his obsession, well into the third act.The second act plays out like a fly-on-the-wall docudrama  CSI-style drama series. The focus here is on Mark Ruffalo's homicide detective whose persistence and perseverance is well commended but again, leads to a cul-de-sac.The final act unravels itself with an understated role played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays the author of the book of which of the film was based on. Gyllenhaal imbues a subdued performance in the first act, only to shine out with an equal, if not surpassing Paul Avery's obsession, morbid obsession over the killer's identity. Even though not explicitly shown, his whole social and family life falls apart as his obsession deepens.Throughout all these acts, the catalyst that glues all three characters is the Zodiac killer or suspect himself. The killings portrayed which are punctuated throughout all three acts, were no doubt stylish and even shocking.

Knowing that the Zodiac killer was never arrested, I was especially curious how they would end the movie. It was revealed gradually that the police did have some intriguing evidence and at least one possible suspect. Though still inconclusive, the movie makes an interesting case and provides an ending which was satisfying enough. As a whole, the movie was a decent mystery brought to life by some interesting characters. Fincher put together a great cast who all turn in good performances, though none are particularly memorable. Jake Gyllenhaal leads the cast as Robert Graysmith, the cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle who develops an obsession with the case. Mark Ruffalo plays Inspector David Toschi, who is kept on the case the longest. Robert Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery, the Chronicle reporter who originally covered the case and even received a letter from the Zodiac.The movie starts with the crimes and the initial investigations. The letters with messages written in code sent by the killer to the newspapers were particularly intriguing. Even when the killer seems to disappear for awhile, the case still has a lasting effect on those involved. Avery turns to drinking and loses his job. Toschi loses his position within the police force when he is incriminated for possibly forging one of the letters. Graysmith's family life is strained by his obsession with the case. The story picks up more speed when Graysmith starts to connect some of the clues on his own while working on a book.

1076742,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B000QUCNOU,David A. Wend,"[4, 5]","First off, many of the reviewers have commented on the length of Zodiac.  It is 160 minutes long and I fall into the camp that felt the movie was on the long side.  It is an excellent film but I felt that the momentum was not very strong toward the end of the movie.  The story is told as events happened, date by date. This gives the narrative flow an episodic quality that sometimes seems disconnected.  There are also so many characters involved in the story that are easy to loose track of; for example, a movie projectionist suspected by Robert Graysmith was not well defined as a character and another character named Linda (who gave Graysmith some critical information) was difficult to connect to the story.  I kept wondering who Linda was and how she fit into the story until the dialogue revealed her significance.  It might have been a good idea to have included some a scene or two to introduce us to the first Zodiac victims since they play a pivotal part in Graysmith's later research.All of this said Zodiac is a remarkable film with excellent performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as Robert Graysmith portraying him as a soft-spoken cartoonist who becomes obsessed with discovering who Zodiac is, and Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as columnist Paul Avery.  Mark Ruffalo is great as Inspector and becomes the hard working cop who gives Graysmith some off-the-record support. Chloe Sevigny is very good as Graysmith's wife and John Carroll Lynch (perhaps better know for his role in Fargo) makes a chilling suspect.  Brian Cox is great in the small role of attorney Marvin Belli.Zodiac seamlessly re-creates the late 60's and 1970's and is beautifully photographed by Harris Savides.  Zodiac is a film of the investigation of the Zodiac murders more than it is a murder mystery; we know nothing about the killer, as did the people who were trying to solve the murders.  We discover, as Robert Graysmith did, how the investigation was hampered by multiple jurisdictions with too many people performing the investigation but no one to lead them.

Such a film is ""Zodiac"".  I give credit to director David Fincher for not offering up exploitation fare and trying to give food for thought.  The film's first half is the more successful when the manhunt for the serial killer that terrorized Central California in the late Sixties and early Seventies is fresh and the tensions are more ratcheted.  It's in the second half of the film where it falters slightly.  I give props to the film for concentrating on the psychological impact the manhunt takes on the killer's pursuers.  It's just the way it is told is just a tad meandering.  I'm not going to complain about the length of the film because there are so many examples of great films that exceed 2 and one-half hours.  But in this case the point that's trying to be made is bludgeoned to death and you get a sense of ennui about the whole enterprise.  By all means see ""Zodiac"" because it's better than most fare.  The acting is terrific particularly Mark Ruffalo as a beleagered homicide detective.  Brian Cox has a terrific cameo as famed defense attorney Melvin Belli.

No worries its a current movie right? How expensive can it be? Well I had no idea that some people think its cool to charge 150 dollars for a copy of a movie. Needless to say I was not going to spend that money and looked at other options. I first sought out foreign releases of the film because they were on par with what pricing should be. But after some extensive research I found that these copies lacked certain features the american release retained for example the audio was not Dolby TrueHD and was normal DTS 5.1. Another disappointing aspect was the frame rate was less than the US release. So after all of this I never was able to purchase this Blu that had now become my white whale.Fast forward a few years later and BAM!! Universal realizes they blew it and wanted some more cash from us and decided to re-release this wonderful movie.

The movie probably feels long because the murder scenes are all taken care of in the first twenty minutes. I have read Robert Graysmith's book about the Zodiac killings, and so I knew that murder scenes would not pervade the movie. However, people who have not read Graysmith's book probably expected the murders to continue as such throughout the movie. That means they were probably waiting for another murder scene, which never comes. Fincher seems to know that, for a serial killer movie, it is relatively violence-free, and compensates for the lack of crime scenes by staging some incredibly intense sequences.But in doing this, Fincher makes a slight error. The movie is so factual that it appears Fincher may have researched where people sat at a bar on a certain night. Because of the factual tone of the movie, all the murders take place outside the actual story, at the very beginning. As a result, the murders are forgotten about by the middle of the movie, and casual references made to crime scenes (""That couple that was gunned down in Vallejo last Christmas"" and ""The girl shot out at the golf course"") make little to no sense, especially considering that the Christmas murder is not shown in the film. But this is a very minor mistake, one that, by the end of the movie, is pretty much overlooked.The book of the same name, on which the movie is based, is slightly more detailed than the movie. But honestly, what can you expect? It's a 160 minute movie versus a 300-plus page book. I didn't go into the movie expecting it to be as detailed as the book, but there is a very slight problem with the details in the movie. In the book, the Zodiac's last letter is a very dramatic turning point. It had been nearly three years since the Zodiac had written the San Francisco Chronicle, and when he did, the letter was basically a review of the movie 'The Excorcist.' The hook to the letter is that the movie was playing at only one place in San Francisco: the Northpoint. The letter did not boast of murders or planned attacks like his previous ones, but it was chilling nontheless because it pinpointed where the killer was for two hours at some point in the last week. Another part in the book that is not in the movie is a mention of a cheesy 1971 movie about the Zodiac that played for a week in a San Francisco theater and was seen by less than a thousand people. Authorities set up a prize drawing at the theater that they hoped the real killer would enter because he was such an egotist, and it was also a given that he would see the movie. While it is not confirmed that he ever did go to see the movie, but author Robert Graysmith adds in his book ""the film ends with the implication that the killer may be sitting behind you...and he could have been!"" These interesting little information tid-bits are compromised in the movie, and replaced by scenes that are repeated, and scenes that didn't need to be in the movie. One prime example is a scene where Jake Gyllenhaal's character (who plays Graysmith) collects information on the case with his two children. One of the repeated scenes is one seen in the preview, the one where Gyllenhaal recieves an anonymous, breathy phone call, supposedly from the Zodiac himself. The first scene depicting this is eerie and suspensful, but the second and third time it happens it's repetitive and boring. Another scene that could have been scrapped is a scene between Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr.'s character (Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery, a once prominent Chronicle reporter who covered the case, was threatened by the killer, pursued the case as if he was a cop, developed a cocaine addiction, and eventually succame to his alcoholism and coke addiction) where Gyllenhaal goes to visit a down-and-out Downey on his house boat. The scene consists, mainly, of the two of them discussing the video game Pong, while the theme music plays loudly in the background. Don't get me wrong, these are all great scenes (with the exception of the brief, five second phone call ones). The acting is great and the cinematography and lighting is fantastic. But it's still ten to fifteen minutes of unneeded material that could have been replaced by one of the many interesting mysteries of the case.",5,"Fincher Returns To Form With A Dark, Eerie Detective Drama",1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,4560,"['main', 'complaint', ""'ve"", 'heard', ""'Zodiac"", 'too', 'long', 'Honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'that', 'long', 'few', 'points', 'was', 'looking', 'watch', 'counting', 'minutes', 'ended', 'not', 'was', 'bored', 'ready', 'leave', 'was', 'so', 'engrossed', 'story', 'wanted', 'be', 'longer', 'movie', 'probably', 'feels', 'long', 'murder', 'scenes', 'are', 'taken', 'care', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'have', 'read', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'book', 'Zodiac', 'killings', 'so', 'knew', 'murder', 'scenes', 'would', 'not', 'pervade', 'movie', 'However', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Graysmith', 'book', 'probably', 'expected', 'murders', 'continue', 'such', 'movie', 'were', 'probably', 'waiting', 'murder', 'scene', 'never', 'Fincher', 'know', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'relatively', 'violence-free', 'compensates', 'lack', 'crime', 'scenes', 'staging', 'incredibly', 'intense', 'sequences.But', 'doing', 'Fincher', 'slight', 'error', 'movie', 'so', 'factual', 'Fincher', 'may', 'have', 'researched', 'where', 'people', 'sat', 'bar', 'certain', 'night', 'factual', 'tone', 'movie', 'murders', 'take', 'place', 'actual', 'story', 'very', 'beginning', 'result', 'murders', 'are', 'forgotten', 'middle', 'movie', 'casual', 'references', 'made', 'crime', 'scenes', 'couple', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'Vallejo', 'last', 'Christmas', 'girl', 'shot', 'out', 'golf', 'course', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'especially', 'considering', 'Christmas', 'murder', 'not', 'shown', 'film', 'very', 'minor', 'mistake', 'one', 'end', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'based', 'slightly', 'more', 'detailed', 'movie', 'honestly', 'what', 'can', 'expect', '160', 'minute', 'movie', '300-plus', 'page', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'as', 'detailed', 'book', 'very', 'slight', 'problem', 'details', 'movie', 'book', 'Zodiac', 'last', 'letter', 'very', 'dramatic', 'turning', 'point', 'had', 'been', 'nearly', 'three', 'years', 'Zodiac', 'had', 'written', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'when', 'did', 'letter', 'was', 'basically', 'review', 'movie', 'Excorcist', 'hook', 'letter', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'only', 'one', 'place', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Northpoint', 'letter', 'did', 'not', 'boast', 'murders', 'planned', 'attacks', 'previous', 'ones', 'was', 'chilling', 'nontheless', 'pinpointed', 'where', 'killer', 'was', 'two', 'hours', 'point', 'last', 'week', 'part', 'book', 'not', 'movie', 'mention', 'cheesy', '1971', 'movie', 'Zodiac', 'played', 'week', 'San', 'Francisco', 'theater', 'was', 'seen', 'less', 'thousand', 'people', 'Authorities', 'set', 'up', 'prize', 'drawing', 'theater', 'hoped', 'real', 'killer', 'would', 'enter', 'was', 'such', 'egotist', 'was', 'also', 'given', 'would', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'confirmed', 'ever', 'did', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'author', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'book', 'film', 'implication', 'killer', 'may', 'be', 'sitting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'little', 'information', 'tid-bits', 'are', 'compromised', 'movie', 'replaced', 'scenes', 'are', 'repeated', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'movie', 'One', 'prime', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'who', 'Graysmith', 'information', 'case', 'two', 'children', 'One', 'repeated', 'scenes', 'one', 'seen', 'preview', 'one', 'where', 'Gyllenhaal', 'anonymous', 'breathy', 'phone', 'call', 'supposedly', 'Zodiac', 'first', 'scene', 'depicting', 'eerie', 'suspensful', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'repetitive', 'boring', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'scrapped', 'scene', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'character', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'once', 'prominent', 'Chronicle', 'reporter', 'who', 'covered', 'case', 'was', 'threatened', 'killer', 'pursued', 'case', 'was', 'cop', 'developed', 'cocaine', 'addiction', 'eventually', 'succame', 'alcoholism', 'coke', 'addiction', 'where', 'Gyllenhaal', 'visit', 'down-and-out', 'Downey', 'house', 'boat', 'scene', 'mainly', 'two', 'discussing', 'video', 'game', 'Pong', 'theme', 'music', 'loudly', 'background', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'exception', 'brief', 'five', 'second', 'phone', 'call', 'ones', 'acting', 'great', 'cinematography', 'lighting', 'fantastic', 'still', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'unneeded', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'one', 'many', 'interesting', 'mysteries', 'case']",N/A

1076750,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B000QUCNOU,D. Hartley,"[1, 2]","In a deliciously ironic scene from David Fincher's crime thriller, ""Zodiac"", San Francisco homicide investigator Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), stalks out of a screening of ""Dirty Harry"". He is appalled at what he sees as Hollywood's obvious and crass exploitation of a real-life case that has consumed his life-the hunt for the notorious and ever-elusive ""Zodiac"" serial killer, who terrorized the Bay Area for a good part of the 1970's. (Clint Eastwood's fictional nemesis in ""Dirty Harry"" was a serial killer who taunted the authorities and the media, and referred to himself as ""Scorpio"").That is one of the ""little touches"" in Fincher's multi-layered true crime opus that makes it an instant genre classic. The director has wisely eschewed the broad brush strokes of Grand Guignol that he slathered on in ""Se7en"" for a meticulously detailed etching that is equal parts Michael Mann and Stanley Kubrick, and thoroughly engrossing cinema.The director's notorious perfectionism serves the protagonists well-they are all obsessed individuals. The aforementioned Inspector Toschi and his partner Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards, in a nice comeback) are the type of dedicated cops that have could have strolled right out of an Ed McBain novel. Master scene-stealer Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as Paul Avery, the cocky crime reporter for the S.F.Chronicle who gloms on to the case; his ""partner"" of sorts is the Chronicle's political cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is the first person to connect the dots (thanks to his obsession with cryptograms and puzzles). The nerdish Graysmith eventually becomes the most obsessed of them all, conducting an independent investigation over two decades.Fincher has assembled a film that will please true crime buffs and noir fans alike. The combination of location filming, well-chosen period music and Fincher's OCD-like attention to detail recreates a cinematic vibe that I haven't experienced since the golden days of Sidney Lumet (think ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Serpico"" or ""Prince of the City"".)",5,If it bleeds it leads,1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,2075,"['deliciously', 'ironic', 'scene', 'David', 'Fincher', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Zodiac', 'San', 'Francisco', 'homicide', 'investigator', 'Inspector', 'David', 'Toschi', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'screening', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'appalled', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'obvious', 'crass', 'exploitation', 'real-life', 'case', 'consumed', 'life-the', 'hunt', 'notorious', 'ever-elusive', 'Zodiac', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'terrorized', 'Bay', 'Area', 'good', 'part', '1970', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'fictional', 'nemesis', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'was', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'taunted', 'authorities', 'media', 'referred', 'Scorpio', 'one', 'little', 'touches', 'Fincher', 'multi-layered', 'true', 'crime', 'opus', 'instant', 'genre', 'classic', 'director', 'wisely', 'eschewed', 'broad', 'brush', 'strokes', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'slathered', 'Se7en', 'meticulously', 'detailed', 'etching', 'equal', 'parts', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'cinema.The', 'director', 'notorious', 'perfectionism', 'protagonists', 'well-they', 'are', 'obsessed', 'individuals', 'aforementioned', 'Inspector', 'Toschi', 'partner', 'Inspector', 'William', 'Armstrong', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'nice', 'comeback', 'are', 'type', 'dedicated', 'cops', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'strolled', 'right', 'Ed', 'McBain', 'novel', 'Master', 'scene-stealer', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'perfect', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'cocky', 'crime', 'reporter', 'S.F.Chronicle', 'who', 'gloms', 'case', 'partner', 'sorts', 'Chronicle', 'political', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'first', 'person', 'connect', 'dots', 'thanks', 'obsession', 'cryptograms', 'puzzles', 'nerdish', 'Graysmith', 'eventually', 'most', 'obsessed', 'conducting', 'independent', 'investigation', 'two', 'decades.Fincher', 'assembled', 'film', 'will', 'please', 'true', 'crime', 'buffs', 'noir', 'fans', 'alike', 'combination', 'location', 'filming', 'well-chosen', 'period', 'music', 'Fincher', 'OCD-like', 'attention', 'detail', 'recreates', 'cinematic', 'vibe', 'have', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'golden', 'days', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'think', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Serpico', 'Prince', 'City']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 1]","Lately I've been on a bit of a serial killer spree, checking out movies about/based on real-life serial killers and the times they were active.So I was fully expecting to be blown away by &#34;Zodiac,&#34; David Fincher's account of the Zodiac Killer (whom I had never heard of before). But Fincher's talents are drowned in a sea of minutial facts here, leading to an interesting but not very compelling narrative about a cartoonist who becomes obsessed with catching a serial killer. It doesn't help that most of the best actors are wasted.In 1969, San Francisco Chronicle began receiving encrypted letters from a serial killer who called himself Zodiac, taking credit for past murders and mentioning his plans for future kills. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is only a political cartoonist, but his knack for puzzles allows him to figure out the code that Zodiac is using. Despite not being taken seriously by his fellows, crime writer Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) begins to listen to his theories.After three more killings, police detective Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) is put on the case, and Zodiac begins threatening Avery, and even calls a celebrity lawyer on the radio. Then... he vanishes without a trace. But Graysmith remains obsessed with Zodiac's identity -- and when the killings and phantom calls begin again some years later, he contacts Toschi in hopes of finally identifying the serial killer.David Fincher is an absolutely brilliant director, and he's clearly trying to do his best with this movie. But his talents seem to be squandered in this story, partly because it seems to rely so much on facts and a sense of realism. He is to be admired for sticking mostly to Graysmith's facts rather than wildly sensationalizing them... but that means that the movie has long stretches of quibbling over puzzles and inconsequential clues.Realistic, yes. Fascinating... no. Honestly, the most intriguing parts of the movie are the parts that DON'T involve Graysmith -- the radio conversations, the murders, and Toschi's efforts to solve the case. It's made all the more intriguing because Fincher has Zodiac voiced by three different actors, spreading doubt through your mind about whether there is just one person or more than one.But whenever the story swings back to Graysmith, any tension seems to just quietly leak out of the film. And since the movie's events take place over several years, the tension comes in very small bursts, spread very far apart, which only end up leading to an anticlimax of epic proportions.Part of that is because Graysmith is just not a very interesting character -- for the first two-thirds of the movie, Jake Gyllenhaal does little except look doe-eyed and stare intently at papers. He seems like a cipher for the audience's participation. Marc Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. both do excellent jobs with their roles, although Downey is reduced to doing little except stomping around and drinking.The normally brilliant Fincher seems to be on autopilot for much of &#34;Zodiac,&#34; which has some glorious actors but a lead character who sucks the energy out of the film.

It isn't exploitative, it's unforgetable.  Next we get the cops working the case (and the phones) and zeroing in on a prime suspect and by the last act the case becomes an obsession consuming the cartoonist Robert Graysmith.  Each section succeeds powerfully, and nothing is lost by not imposing a fictionalized ending.  In fact, the omission of the kind of closure found in The Black Dahlia or From Hell is what makes this a masterpiece.  You're haunted by the uncertainties.  You get a taste of Graysmith obsession.For a film with maybe a hundred speaking parts or more there isn't a single false note sounded anywhere. What worked least for me in the theater was Jake as Graysmith, but after watching the real Graysmith in the accompanying documentaries you realize he 's doing a canny imitation.  He also has some deadpan line readings that are the film's funniest.  Downey is sensational as always, but if the film has a standout it's Ruffalo who is brilliant.The score of the film is great and Fincher's use of music from the period will transport you without distracting you.The full-length documentaries on the case are low-key, but devastating as we meet Zodiac's survivors and some of the cops on the case.Great commentary track with film's writer and James Ellroy who gives his endorsement of this masterwork.",5,All the Maniac's Men,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,1941,"['David', 'Fincher', 'recounting', 'search', 'Bay', 'area', 'serial', 'killer', '60s', '70s', 'presented', 'here', 'director', 'cut', 'easily', 'best', 'film', '2007', 'many', 'director', 'cut', 'here', 'are', 'seamless', 'Everything', 'essential', 'power', 'epic', 'brilliantly', 'detailed', 'procedural.The', 'picture', 'three', 'neatly', 'constructed', 'acts', 'first', 'chillingly', 'crimes', 'scenes', 'are', 'beach', 'landing', 'Private', 'Ryan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'never', 'filmakers', 'force', 'confront', 'what', 'happened', 'terror', 'banaility', ""n't"", 'exploitative', 'unforgetable', 'get', 'cops', 'working', 'case', 'phones', 'zeroing', 'prime', 'suspect', 'last', 'act', 'case', 'obsession', 'consuming', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'section', 'powerfully', 'nothing', 'lost', 'not', 'imposing', 'fictionalized', 'ending', 'fact', 'omission', 'kind', 'closure', 'found', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'From', 'Hell', 'what', 'masterpiece', ""'re"", 'haunted', 'uncertainties', 'get', 'taste', 'Graysmith', 'obsession.For', 'film', 'maybe', 'hundred', 'speaking', 'parts', 'more', ""n't"", 'single', 'false', 'note', 'sounded', 'anywhere', 'What', 'worked', 'least', 'theater', 'was', 'Jake', 'Graysmith', 'watching', 'real', 'Graysmith', 'accompanying', 'documentaries', 'realize', 'doing', 'canny', 'imitation', 'also', 'deadpan', 'line', 'readings', 'are', 'film', 'funniest', 'Downey', 'sensational', 'always', 'film', 'standout', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'brilliant.The', 'score', 'film', 'great', 'Fincher', 'use', 'music', 'period', 'will', 'transport', 'distracting', 'you.The', 'full-length', 'documentaries', 'case', 'are', 'low-key', 'devastating', 'meet', 'Zodiac', 'survivors', 'cops', 'case.Great', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'writer', 'James', 'Ellroy', 'who', 'endorsement', 'masterwork']",N/A
1076758,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000QUCNOU,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","Even though I was a child, I distinctly recall the news coverage of the Zodiac killer manhunt nearly forty years ago, which served as the inspiration for Clint Eastwood's epochal film, 1971'sDirty Harry. David Fincher's meticulous 2007 film, however, is not a standard action shoot-`em-up. In tone and pacing, it seems to have been inspired by Alan J. Pakula'sAll the President's Men(1976). Both movies take on the guise of a suspenseful, character-rich detective story that highlights the obsession that takes over the police and the press in uncovering high-profile crimes. Unlike Pakula, however, Fincher does not propel James Vanderbilt's time-spanning script (based on Robert Graysmith's 1986 book,Zodiac) as forcefully and lets the story go on far too long to be consistently compelling, especially as he is forced by facts to leave the resolution open-ended.The story traces three main protagonists over several years - San Francisco police detective Dave Toschi and two of the staff at the San Francisco Chronicle, veteran crime beat reporter Paul Avery and young cartoonist-turned-writer Graysmith. It is ironically Graysmith who is the most tenacious in finding the murderer as the encrypted letters sent to the newspaper offices feed into his natural interest in puzzles. As one would expect from the maker ofSe7enandFight Club, Fincher does not shy away from the details of the graphic killings, but the movie is far more about the frustrating pursuit by the three men separately and together. The cat-and-mouse tension works best albeit most predictably when Toschi and his fellow law enforcement officers are involved. The journalistic pursuit is comparatively less interesting because Avery's self-destructive tendencies and Graysmith's mounting preoccupation do not measure up dramatically to the palpable idea of the killer being caught and punished by the law.Typical of this genre, the performances for the most part are workmanlike. Playing a character that inspired not only Eastwood but Steve McQueen'sBullitt, Mark Ruffalo lends his familiar ramshackle persona to the sardonic character of Toschi - more like Columbo than Callahan. As the alcoholic, drug-addled Avery, Robert Downey Jr. shows an obvious affinity to his character, and he makes the most of it, even if it all feels a little too familiar. Jake Gyllenhaal grabs the most screen time and provides an effective portrait of Graysmith as he evolves from nave and impressionable to haunted and indiscriminately desperate. Smaller roles are filled by Anthony Edwards as Toschi's upstanding partner, Chlo Sevigny as Graysmith's increasingly alienated wife, Brian Cox in a ham-fisted turn as attorney Melvin Belli, and best of all, John Carroll Lynch in a subtle performance as prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen with only a hint of malevolence.The marathon 156-minute running time helps create an almost mini-series feel to the whole venture, but Fincher's dark, supple filmmaking style compensates to a great degree. The period detail is evocative without resorting to kitsch or heavy nostalgia, for example, the primitive state of telecommunications is conveyed perfectly in a scene where the various city police departments try to coordinate the sharing of evidence. I happened upon the filming at the San Francisco Chronicle building on the way to work last year since I live just a few blocks away and was able to witness first-hand the meticulous attention to historical detail in the vehicles and the characters' wardrobe. The 2007 DVD is bereft of extras apparently in preparation for a two-disc Special Edition DVD set that will include the commentary tracks and featurettes one would have expected here.",4,Overlong But Still Involving Story of the Pursuit of the Elusive Zodiac Killer,1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,3691,"['Even', 'was', 'child', 'distinctly', 'recall', 'news', 'coverage', 'Zodiac', 'killer', 'manhunt', 'nearly', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'served', 'inspiration', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'epochal', 'film', ""1971'sDirty"", 'Harry', 'David', 'Fincher', 'meticulous', '2007', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'standard', 'action', 'shoot-', 'em-up', 'tone', 'pacing', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'Alan', 'J.', ""Pakula'sAll"", 'President', 'Men', '1976', 'movies', 'take', 'guise', 'suspenseful', 'character-rich', 'detective', 'story', 'obsession', 'police', 'press', 'uncovering', 'high-profile', 'crimes', 'Pakula', 'however', 'Fincher', 'not', 'propel', 'James', 'Vanderbilt', 'time-spanning', 'script', 'based', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', '1986', 'book', 'Zodiac', 'forcefully', 'story', 'go', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'be', 'consistently', 'compelling', 'especially', 'forced', 'facts', 'leave', 'resolution', 'open-ended.The', 'story', 'traces', 'three', 'main', 'protagonists', 'several', 'years', 'San', 'Francisco', 'police', 'detective', 'Dave', 'Toschi', 'two', 'staff', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'veteran', 'crime', 'beat', 'reporter', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'young', 'cartoonist-turned-writer', 'Graysmith', 'ironically', 'Graysmith', 'who', 'most', 'tenacious', 'finding', 'murderer', 'encrypted', 'letters', 'sent', 'newspaper', 'offices', 'feed', 'natural', 'interest', 'puzzles', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'maker', 'ofSe7enandFight', 'Club', 'Fincher', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'details', 'graphic', 'killings', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'frustrating', 'pursuit', 'three', 'men', 'separately', 'together', 'cat-and-mouse', 'tension', 'best', 'most', 'predictably', 'when', 'Toschi', 'fellow', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'are', 'involved', 'journalistic', 'pursuit', 'comparatively', 'less', 'interesting', 'Avery', 'self-destructive', 'tendencies', 'Graysmith', 'mounting', 'preoccupation', 'do', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'dramatically', 'palpable', 'idea', 'killer', 'being', 'caught', 'punished', 'law.Typical', 'genre', 'performances', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'workmanlike', 'Playing', 'character', 'inspired', 'not', 'only', 'Eastwood', 'Steve', ""McQueen'sBullitt"", 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'familiar', 'ramshackle', 'persona', 'sardonic', 'character', 'Toschi', 'more', 'Columbo', 'Callahan', 'alcoholic', 'drug-addled', 'Avery', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'obvious', 'affinity', 'character', 'most', 'even', 'little', 'too', 'familiar', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'grabs', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'effective', 'portrait', 'Graysmith', 'nave', 'impressionable', 'haunted', 'indiscriminately', 'desperate', 'Smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Toschi', 'upstanding', 'partner', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'Graysmith', 'increasingly', 'alienated', 'wife', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'ham-fisted', 'turn', 'attorney', 'Melvin', 'Belli', 'best', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'subtle', 'performance', 'prime', 'suspect', 'Arthur', 'Leigh', 'Allen', 'only', 'hint', 'malevolence.The', 'marathon', '156-minute', 'running', 'time', 'create', 'almost', 'mini-series', 'feel', 'whole', 'venture', 'Fincher', 'dark', 'supple', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'compensates', 'great', 'degree', 'period', 'detail', 'evocative', 'resorting', 'kitsch', 'heavy', 'nostalgia', 'example', 'primitive', 'state', 'telecommunications', 'conveyed', 'perfectly', 'scene', 'where', 'various', 'city', 'police', 'departments', 'try', 'coordinate', 'sharing', 'evidence', 'happened', 'filming', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'building', 'way', 'work', 'last', 'year', 'live', 'just', 'few', 'blocks', 'away', 'was', 'able', 'witness', 'first-hand', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'historical', 'detail', 'vehicles', 'characters', 'wardrobe', '2007', 'DVD', 'bereft', 'extras', 'apparently', 'preparation', 'two-disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'include', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'here']",N/A

For those who have read my other review [The Zodiac Killer-which was a good movie over all] about this fame seeking individual will know what I think of this chump. This seemed like a real event to me when I was watching it [as in the movie felt real, I know the events actually took place] since the atmosphere, writing, direction, and acting seemed to be in top order. For fans of serial killer movies and movie fans over all this is worth while flick that is purchase worthy in my opinion. Of course I am sure you all know what it is basically about, the killer right? KindaWhile the movie is basically about this guy the true story lies within the people who covered the killings and the ones who investigated them. And even then it is not truly about those people it is about how it affected their lives and changed them. You may be saying well that means it is about them then, no because how it affected them is basically how it affected the whole area. This movie is about the impact this glory hound had on the population during this time, the book on which this is based is great by the way.Any way the film follows a couple of different people from the lead investigators to other police officers from different areas, and of course the newspaper employees who followed this case as well. It was interesting to see these people go through changes that altered their lives forever; some just gave up while stayed obsessed with the case. Director David Fincher who you may know from making other great films like ""Seven and Fight Club"" I believe does a great job with this movie. Although you will say to yourself at one point or another ""this is a long movie"" it still is a great viewing experience. James Vanderbilt's screenplay based on Robert Graysmith's book is wonderful and really brings the people on screen to life.Speaking of author Robert Graysmith he is played wonderfully by Jake Gyllenhaal whose obsession with the case drives him closer and closer to an answer he will never truly get. Maybe one day but as far as the book and film even though he believes he knows who the Zodiac is he will never truly get the answer as of now. Jake is great n this film and you can see the transformation of an everyday average guy to a man who becomes so obsessed that he alienates his own family. Mark Ruffalo is great as well playing Inspector David Toschi as is Anthony Edwards who plays Inspector William Armstrong. Both do great jobs in this film and are truly upset that they never caught their man.One of my favorite actors out there Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as usual playing Paul Avery. This guy goes from being one of the most confident people ever to being reduced to a shell of his former self, even though he ends up helping more then he thinks when Robert comes to see him. Another great performance comes in the form of John Carroll Lynch who plays the lead suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. Both these guys deliver well and add a lot to the film, glad both were cast in this. Still everyone that was in this movie deserves credit because all were good and deserve praise for their acting abilities.This is a little more held back as far as blood and stuff compared to the filmmakers previous films but that adds to the atmosphere in my opinion. This is a wonderful movie that I truly believe most would enjoy even if it feels a bit long. The only problem is that if you want some special features you have to buy the two disc version, this single disc has nothing on it really. Still if it is all you can find the movie alone is worth it, go rent, buy or what ever this movie.",4,4 STARS FOR THE SINGLE DISC,1237939200,"03 25, 2009",2009,3721,"['ZODIACThis', 'movie', 'actually', 'very', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'look', 'coward', 'named', '[', 'self', 'named', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'review', 'Zodiac', 'Killer-which', 'was', 'good', 'movie', ']', 'fame', 'seeking', 'individual', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'chump', 'seemed', 'real', 'event', 'when', 'was', 'watching', '[', 'movie', 'felt', 'real', 'know', 'events', 'actually', 'took', 'place', ']', 'atmosphere', 'writing', 'direction', 'acting', 'seemed', 'be', 'top', 'order', 'fans', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'movie', 'fans', 'worth', 'flick', 'purchase', 'worthy', 'opinion', 'course', 'am', 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'basically', 'about', 'killer', 'right', 'movie', 'basically', 'guy', 'true', 'story', 'lies', 'people', 'who', 'covered', 'killings', 'ones', 'who', 'investigated', 'even', 'then', 'not', 'truly', 'people', 'how', 'affected', 'lives', 'changed', 'may', 'be', 'saying', 'well', 'then', 'how', 'affected', 'basically', 'how', 'affected', 'whole', 'area', 'movie', 'impact', 'glory', 'hound', 'had', 'population', 'time', 'book', 'based', 'great', 'way.Any', 'way', 'film', 'couple', 'different', 'people', 'lead', 'investigators', 'other', 'police', 'officers', 'different', 'areas', 'course', 'newspaper', 'employees', 'who', 'followed', 'case', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'people', 'go', 'changes', 'altered', 'lives', 'forever', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'stayed', 'obsessed', 'case', 'Director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'who', 'may', 'know', 'making', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'Seven', 'Fight', 'Club', 'believe', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'point', 'long', 'movie', 'still', 'great', 'viewing', 'experience', 'James', 'Vanderbilt', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'book', 'wonderful', 'really', 'people', 'screen', 'life.Speaking', 'author', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'obsession', 'case', 'closer', 'closer', 'answer', 'will', 'never', 'truly', 'get', 'Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'as', 'far', 'book', 'film', 'even', 'who', 'Zodiac', 'will', 'never', 'truly', 'get', 'answer', 'now', 'Jake', 'great', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'transformation', 'everyday', 'average', 'guy', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'obsessed', 'own', 'family', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'great', 'well', 'playing', 'Inspector', 'David', 'Toschi', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'who', 'Inspector', 'William', 'Armstrong', 'do', 'great', 'jobs', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'upset', 'never', 'caught', 'man.One', 'favorite', 'actors', 'there', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'excellent', 'usual', 'playing', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'guy', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'confident', 'people', 'ever', 'being', 'reduced', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'even', 'up', 'helping', 'more', 'then', 'when', 'Robert', 'see', 'great', 'performance', 'form', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'who', 'lead', 'suspect', 'Arthur', 'Leigh', 'Allen', 'Both', 'guys', 'deliver', 'well', 'add', 'lot', 'film', 'glad', 'were', 'cast', 'Still', 'everyone', 'was', 'movie', 'credit', 'were', 'good', 'deserve', 'praise', 'acting', 'abilities.This', 'little', 'more', 'held', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'blood', 'stuff', 'compared', 'filmmakers', 'previous', 'films', 'atmosphere', 'opinion', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'truly', 'believe', 'most', 'would', 'enjoy', 'even', 'bit', 'long', 'only', 'problem', 'want', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'buy', 'two', 'disc', 'version', 'single', 'disc', 'nothing', 'really', 'Still', 'can', 'find', 'movie', 'alone', 'go', 'rent', 'buy', 'what', 'ever', 'movie']",N/A

1076765,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000QUCNOU,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[4, 6]","The single most famous unidentified serial killer of the 20th Century, The Zodiac terrorized California with seven confirmed victims between 1968 and 1969 and numerous letters to area media--most specifically San Francisco newspapers--between 1969 and at least 1974.  No one was arrested for the crimes, which remain unsolved to this day.This would seem to place ZODIAC in the interesting position of being a mystery without a solution, but this is not really the case.  Like author Robert Graysmith, from whose book which it is largely drawn, ZODIAC strongly supports a particular notion about the killer's identity.  Even so, the film is actually less about the killer and his crimes than it is about the way in which a great number of people become obsessed with the case and how it impacts their lives.ZODIAC focuses on three men: reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), both with the San Francisco Chronicle, and Inspector David Toshi (Mark Ruffalo) of the San Francisco Police Department.  In one way or another, the case seems to destroy the lives of those most particularly involved in its processes, and the film hands off its action and point of view from one man to the next until it comes to rest on Graysmith, whose obession with the case leads him to put his family at risk and places his marriage in jeopardy.Any one coming to ZODIAC with the idea that it will contain the same sort of jolts as such films as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS will likely be very, very disappointed: the violence involved is seldom graphic, the pace is very deliberate, and the film frequently raises tags that are never really resolved.  When ZODIAC comes to an end we know who Graysmith believes to be the killer, but there is no hard and fast proof one way or another, so there is no firm resolution.  If this sounds unfortunate, it is not: it is considerably more creepy than anything you might imagine.The performances are excellent throughout the entire film, the direction walks a fine line between being excessively low-key and over-extension, and the cinematography and art direction are memorable.  Although the original DVD release offers a handsome print, it is worth pointing out that it includes no extras of any kind--hardcore fans will no doubt prefer the double DVD ""special"" release.

1076768,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000QUCNOU,Grady Harp,"[39, 44]","ZODIAC is director David Fincher's finest film to date.  All of the preparatory exercises in violence and horror he served so well in such films as FIGHT CLUB and SEVEN now are even more terrifying because of the manner in which he internalizes the events of the infamous Zodiac killer of the 1960s and 1970s and allows us to see how the murders and lack of proof of the perpetrator destroyed the personal lives of those bound to reveal Zodiac's identity. The story of course is true, as documented in Robert Graysmith's book (adapted extremely well for the screen by James Vanderbilt), and the history is so well known that rehashing it in a review is pointless.  But on to the production.Filmed in the Bay area the film has that peculiar light known to artists of the region but rarely captured so well as it is here by cinematographer Harris Savides: the sunlight (when visualized is brilliant and the night portions are dank not only form the seeming constant rain but also form the seediness of the story's message. The acting is of the highest caliber: newspaper cartoonist Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal, in a standout role), police inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo, in one of his finest performances), news writer Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.), Melvin Belli (Brian Cox), Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), Graysmith's long-suffering wife Melanie (Chlo Sevigny), down to the more minor roles are all pitch perfect.What makes this film work so well is the emphasis on the human aspect of how violence, especially random and uncontrolled, alters the psyches of people.  The breakdown from the stress of the fruitless and frustrating investigation by each of the primary characters is heart wrenching. How much of this is actor driven by such talented pros and how much is due to Fincher's directorial abilities is probably a moot point. The very long unwinding of this struggle (158 minutes) becomes almost unbearably tense.  While the Added Features of this set open windows of information that delve more deeply into this unsolved horror story, the film still stands solidly on its own without the added accoutrements. This is a very fine film that is worthy of the many awards that are dangling in space at the moment.

1076770,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B000QUCNOU,guillermoj,"[7, 23]","By now most already know enough about the story that ""Zodiac"" is based on so I won't do into the details of what is without a doubt not an easy story to tackle as it takes takes place over many years and there is no neatly tied ending. After seeing the preview, I was hooked as I am a huge fan of the 3 main actors and wanted to see what a talented director like David Fincher would do with it.I saw the movie yesterday and could not have been more disappointed and not for the reasons that most people would think as I was not bothered by the lack of ""closure"" nor the running time of the film as some films require a longer run time than others to tell their stories, but this one simply fails to entertain.The starting culprit is a script is simply a mess. It is very unfocused, characters come and go without rhyme or reason, and rarely achieves the level of suspense that it should have generarated. One could argue that the script reflects exactly what it was trying to do, which could be to put you in the mindset of those involved and how nothing seemed to jell. While there may be artistic merit in the thesis, it fails as a movie must find a way to entertain even telling this frustrating tale. I was especially bored by the detectives'/writers' home scenes as they seem cliched and with the exception Ione Skye (great job in a tiny role), the story relegates women to being who happen to share a sleeping pace with men.I do aplaud David Fincher for trying to tackle the story as it's miles apart from most of his previous work, and while he succeeds at times (especially at the beginning), gets the 1970s ""look"" without going overboard, and delivers with some interesting visuals, the movie as a whole simply a big bore. It would have been such if it had been 90 minutes long so again it's not about the running time.The performances are good across the board, especially of the actor playing the main suspect and Mark Ruffalo, once you can put aside that he looks a little too much like Columbo is his early scenes. But then you could put Mark Ruffalo in anything in he would be great. Jake Gyllenhall does an OK job but he seems to be playing himself and Anthony Edwards does not really bring anything special to the role. Robert Downey Jr. manges to create some sexual ambiguity and presence to his role, but not nearly enough to keep you interested in him.There are so many alleged horror/suspense movies being released now and they are all making all sorts of money as they appear to be upping the ante on the old ""Friday the 13th"" ""Nightmare on Elmstreet"" movies. This movie, thankfully is not one of these cheapie attempts at capturing a teenage audience by grossing them out, but it is not the adult suspense thriller that it is being marketed as. It's more of a traditional procedural, and for those who liked it could be described as the anti-""CSI"" as modern technology certainly does not play a role on it.It's hard to only give 2 stars to this movie as it has so much talent behind it and one should not penalize it for that but only for what it delivers. So using the ""deliverabilty"" barometer, it barely registers a 2 as it did not find a way to make this frustrating story more compelling and the whole ""Zodiac"" angle in presented in a rather chessy manner and nowhere as flashy as the previews would have you believe.David Fincher is a talented director but here he seems to rally be trying heard to get away from his usual strengths and the movie only succeeds when he goes back to them: scenes of unexpected violence and the psychology ot lack thereof in the acts. The movie gets some things right, esp. the ""look"" of San Fransisco in the 1970s, and there are moments when you are really hoping that the movie will take off.",2,Ultimately a very disappointing film,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,3753,"['now', 'most', 'already', 'know', 'enough', 'story', 'Zodiac', 'based', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'details', 'what', 'doubt', 'not', 'easy', 'story', 'tackle', 'place', 'many', 'years', 'neatly', 'tied', 'ending', 'seeing', 'preview', 'was', 'hooked', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', '3', 'main', 'actors', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'talented', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'would', 'do', 'it.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'yesterday', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'disappointed', 'not', 'reasons', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'not', 'bothered', 'lack', 'closure', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'films', 'require', 'longer', 'run', 'time', 'others', 'tell', 'stories', 'one', 'simply', 'entertain.The', 'starting', 'culprit', 'script', 'simply', 'mess', 'very', 'unfocused', 'characters', 'come', 'go', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'rarely', 'level', 'suspense', 'should', 'have', 'generarated', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'script', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'mindset', 'involved', 'how', 'nothing', 'seemed', 'jell', 'may', 'be', 'artistic', 'merit', 'thesis', 'movie', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'entertain', 'even', 'telling', 'frustrating', 'tale', 'was', 'especially', 'bored', ""detectives'/writers"", 'home', 'scenes', 'seem', 'cliched', 'exception', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'great', 'job', 'tiny', 'role', 'story', 'women', 'being', 'who', 'happen', 'share', 'sleeping', 'pace', 'men.I', 'do', 'aplaud', 'David', 'Fincher', 'trying', 'tackle', 'story', 'miles', 'apart', 'most', 'previous', 'work', 'times', 'especially', 'beginning', '1970s', 'look', 'going', 'overboard', 'delivers', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'movie', 'whole', 'simply', 'big', 'bore', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'such', 'had', 'been', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'so', 'again', 'not', 'running', 'time.The', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'board', 'especially', 'actor', 'playing', 'main', 'suspect', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'once', 'can', 'put', 'aside', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Columbo', 'early', 'scenes', 'then', 'could', 'put', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhall', 'OK', 'job', 'be', 'playing', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'not', 'really', 'bring', 'anything', 'special', 'role', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'create', 'sexual', 'ambiguity', 'presence', 'role', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'alleged', 'horror/suspense', 'movies', 'being', 'released', 'now', 'are', 'making', 'sorts', 'money', 'appear', 'be', 'upping', 'ante', 'old', 'Friday', '13th', 'Nightmare', 'Elmstreet', 'movies', 'movie', 'thankfully', 'not', 'one', 'cheapie', 'attempts', 'capturing', 'teenage', 'audience', 'grossing', 'out', 'not', 'adult', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'being', 'marketed', 'more', 'traditional', 'procedural', 'who', 'liked', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'anti-', 'CSI', 'modern', 'technology', 'certainly', 'not', 'play', 'role', 'it.It', 'hard', 'only', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'penalize', 'only', 'what', 'So', 'using', 'deliverabilty', 'barometer', 'barely', '2', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'frustrating', 'story', 'more', 'compelling', 'whole', 'Zodiac', 'angle', 'presented', 'rather', 'chessy', 'manner', 'nowhere', 'as', 'flashy', 'previews', 'would', 'have', 'believe.David', 'Fincher', 'talented', 'director', 'here', 'rally', 'be', 'trying', 'heard', 'get', 'away', 'usual', 'strengths', 'movie', 'only', 'when', 'back', 'scenes', 'unexpected', 'violence', 'psychology', 'lack', 'thereof', 'acts', 'movie', 'things', 'right', 'esp', 'look', 'San', 'Fransisco', '1970s', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'are', 'really', 'hoping', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'off']",N/A
1076771,A3P9D22KDEXVMN,B000QUCNOU,"Happy Chappy ""An Avid Reader.""","[3, 4]","I have just finished viewing the 2007 film Zodiac - directed by David Fincher - about the infamous serial killer.  What an excellent movie.  The acting in this movie was exceptional, especially Jake Gyllenhaal as cartoonist Robert Graysmith, Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi, and Robert Downey Jr. as crime reporter Paul Avery.  The movie also features a solid turn for Anthony [of ER fame] Edwards as Toschi's partner Inspector William Armstrong.  John Carroll Lynch [from the Drew Carey show, among many other films and shows] also does a fine job as one of the suspect's; the creepy Arthur Leigh Allen.The cinematography truly captures a late 60's through 70's San Francisco.  The visuals were very pleasing in this film.  There were several very chilling moments in the movie as well.  Admittedly, I had not read either of Graysmith's books.  I did; however, thumb through both at the bookstore, so I had some idea who the author ultimately believed was the killer.  The movie kept you guessing the entire time.  The music perfectly captured the uncomfortable sense of foreboding that went with several of the scenes.The theme of the movie is obviously obsession and how it overcomes people.  I don't think that is always bad, especially in a case like this where the end result will - hopefully - net the arrest of a dangerous criminal.  Gyllenhaal really was outstanding in the way his performance sold the obsession that Graysmith developed with the case.I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in crime movies, true stories, and true mysteries.  First and foremost, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys great films, great directing, and great acting.  I found Zodiac to be a thoroughly engrossing 5 star movie experience.  I was disappointed that there were not special features included with the DVD, as I would have enjoyed seeing/hearing from the real Graysmith.",5,Excellent Movie and Performances,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,1896,"['have', 'just', 'finished', 'viewing', '2007', 'film', 'Zodiac', 'directed', 'David', 'Fincher', 'infamous', 'serial', 'killer', 'What', 'excellent', 'movie', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'exceptional', 'especially', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Inspector', 'David', 'Toschi', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'crime', 'reporter', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'movie', 'also', 'solid', 'turn', 'Anthony', '[', 'ER', 'fame', ']', 'Edwards', 'Toschi', 'partner', 'Inspector', 'William', 'Armstrong', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', '[', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'show', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'shows', ']', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'one', 'suspect', 'creepy', 'Arthur', 'Leigh', 'Allen.The', 'cinematography', 'truly', 'late', '60', '70', 'San', 'Francisco', 'visuals', 'were', 'very', 'pleasing', 'film', 'were', 'several', 'very', 'chilling', 'moments', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Admittedly', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'either', 'Graysmith', 'books', 'did', 'however', 'thumb', 'bookstore', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'author', 'ultimately', 'believed', 'was', 'killer', 'movie', 'kept', 'guessing', 'entire', 'time', 'music', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'uncomfortable', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'went', 'several', 'scenes.The', 'theme', 'movie', 'obviously', 'obsession', 'how', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'always', 'bad', 'especially', 'case', 'where', 'end', 'result', 'will', 'hopefully', 'net', 'arrest', 'dangerous', 'criminal', 'Gyllenhaal', 'really', 'was', 'outstanding', 'way', 'performance', 'sold', 'obsession', 'Graysmith', 'developed', 'case.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'interested', 'crime', 'movies', 'true', 'stories', 'true', 'mysteries', 'First', 'foremost', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'great', 'films', 'great', 'directing', 'great', 'acting', 'found', 'Zodiac', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'experience', 'was', 'disappointed', 'were', 'not', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'seeing/hearing', 'real', 'Graysmith']",N/A
1076772,A18MBO1U4DPY20,B000QUCNOU,Harkanwar Anand,"[4, 7]","Does Zodiac have a suspense? I'm not telling you.Thirty minutes into the film, I started wishing I didn't watch it at home and was at the theater. Being a period film (and not just a period film) , Zodiac manages to switch timeline from the 60's to the 70's and holds your attention quite keenly. The dialogues, the acting, the sets, locations, cars and the film's music and overall spirit is hardly underwhelming.Zodiac is the story of a serial killer who loves leaving clues. This is just a mere statement from the film without any over-bearing significance. HOWEVER,  what is most interesting about his manner of killing are the clues he leaves in newspapers, at parking lots, on the bodies of the victims, on greeting cards and on mails addressed to the newspapers and on conversations with victims, police and media.Although it is like Seven, Zodiac is a different Seven of it's own. It's pace doesn't really allow you to judge it, instead it poses in many ways and decorates itself and the sheer energy, enthusiasm and work that has gone behind making this film a success is hearty. Forget all that, take for instance, the scenes involving phone booth sequences, the double questioning of the integrity of each character, the vague semi-conclusions, the way people would sit around T.V waiting for news to unfold, those recorder tapes that remind you of a movie called ""The Conversation"" and what not - ensure a great film watching experience.The murders were very enjoyable. You will love the doubt. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the film. People who loved Departed - would like to give Zodiac a chance.This is maybe the best film I have seen in 2007 although I haven't seen too many. You will also fall in love with ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" by Donovan. The song truly reflects the rage this film tries so hard to build up.Jake Gyllenhaal, fantastic work.

However, as soon as I did start watching it, right from the incredibly beautiful long shot from inside the car at the beginning of the film, I suddenly remembered that David Fincher is one of the most supremely visually gifted directors out there and that it would probably be worth watching just about anything he directed (except, well, maybe an old Paula Abdul video).  Fincher seems to be something of a perfectionist and his movies are so richly detailed and carefully assembled that it just reminds you depressingly how slapdash most other films are in comparison.  The production design is fantastic here and you really do feel like you are back in the 60s and 70s without it feeling cliched and caricatured.Zodiac is probably just a tad too long for its own good and has the problem of having to stick to a set of historical facts that might not have provided the most highly dramatic framework in the second half of the film, which has a slightly different feel than the first as it moves into the investigative section following Gyllenhaal's character Graysmith and away from the deeds of the Zodiac killer (though they try mighty hard to add dramatic punch to expository scenes where they can).  The acting is generally excellent, particularly Ruffalo, Downey and the underappreciated Anthony Edwards.  The movie is probably more successful as a portrait of the ripple effects of a violent criminal on the individuals he touches and a bit less successful as a portrait of obsessive behavior in the form of Graysmith's growing singlemindedness about the case.  This falls just short of a five star film but not by much and it shows a tremendous confidence and maturity about it that bodes well for Fincher's future; Fincher could easily have moved in the direction of more and more flash and less substance but this piece of work is a good sign.  This film's not going to be for everyone given the serial killing subject matter and given the length, restrained pacing, and the ultimate inconclusiveness of the ending, but the rest of you know who you are: just see it.On the other hand, maybe you should just wait a bit longer if you've waited until now.

Despite having some slight flaws and a soundtrack that could have been far better, I really liked this movie... It's in the similar vein of stuff like JFK where you feel like there is a huge mystery unfolding before your very eyes, and even though the answers that are given in this film are purely hypothetical (much like JFK), one cannot help but to still be enticed and intrigued by the subject matter as a whole. I really think that this is Fincher's best film since Se7en (I found Fight Club to be far too tongue 'n cheek and juvenile for my liking). Special props go out to Robert Downey Jr., who's burn out witty alcoholic character is played with such deadpan accuracy that one cannot help but to feel that Robert was there himself at one time, heh. Other than that, people who are expecting something overly grisly and violent in nature should stick to the usual horror schlock that seems to be coming out these days.... This is a film that makes you think. The violence is portrayed with a sense of real life accuracy, and I appreciate that quite a bit since it puts things into perspective rather than over-exaggerating the truth and exploiting a real life tragedy like so many of these type of films tend to do.... One thing that I didn't like, though, was the usage of pop music during the killing scenes (ala Martin Scorsese). I would have much preferred something devilish or creepy playing instead. Oh well..... Another problem was the uber lame family life scenes that should have been cut out of the film in order to bring the film's lengthy time down (Zodiac is actually quite a long movie). It seemed ultra cliche to see the main character arguing with his overly needy wife about his obsession with the Zodiac case.

1076780,ALJWRGOANWDWJ,B000QUCNOU,Jack-O-Lantern,"[2, 3]","Being a true crime buff, I eagerly anticipated two recent releases:  Brian DePalma's ""The Black Dahlia"" and David Fincher's ""Zodiac.""  The Black Dahlia film was incredibly inept in every respect, simply an awful movie.  As such, I went to see ""Zodiac"" in an extremely skeptical state of mind.  I was not disappointed this time.  ""Zodiac"" is one of the most gripping crime dramas ever made, comparable to such classics as ""In Cold Blood,"" ""The Boston Strangler,"" ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Capote.""Being a Bay Area native (as is director Fincher), I remember very clearly the palpable sense of fear and anxiety which enveloped the San Francisco area during the Zodiac's reign of terror in the late '60's - early '70's.  The media went wild, curfews were imposed, doors were locked and bolted, guns were purchased, and children were herded inside well before dark.  Scary times.And all that has been vividly brought back in this starkly realistic, understated yet extraordinarily powerful film.  David Fincher has captured the very essence of time and place, taking us back to a much more innocent era darkened by such California horrors as the Zodiac crimes in San Francisco and the Manson / Tate murders in Los Angeles (both occuring during the same summer of 1969).  Scary times indeed.This story is much more a crime procedural than a ""serial killer"" film, as the murders themselves are de-emphasized over the incredible efforts (and some real blunders) made by the S.F.P.D. and other local law enforecment agencies to identify and capture this monster.  The killings are presented, however, in an incredibly realistic (and EXTREMELY accurate) manner, and as such are truly horrifying and difficult to watch.To those who feel the film is too long, or boring, or not violent enough, all I can offer is the fact that this was all real, not made up by some hack screenwriter.  Perhaps because I lived through those times and have extremely vivid memories of them, this film carries more import for me personally.  I can say that I held my breath for most of the film's running time and did not experience a nano-second of boredom (in fact I actually felt the film could have covered MORE ground--i.e., the early killings not depicted in the film).As in real life, the end result is far from satisfying:  the killer was never caught, and the film leaves you hanging, just as we all were left hanging over 30 years ago.  Frustrating, yes...but that's the way it was.Simply put, this film is superb in every way:  direction, screenplay, photography, production design, music, acting (though I must briefly note that I've had about enough of Robert Downey's  twitchy, mumbling performances, and if there were any one thing I'd change about this film it would be his casting).An intense, cerebral, unsettling and ultimately shocking film.

What makes this story interesting is the fact that the police never succeeded and never arrested the killer, in spite of the help of the media in San Francisco. It all amounted to circumstantial evidence and no indictment, not to mention conviction, was ever pronounced, hence no suspect declared and arrested. The case can come out today because all those who were suspected to have played a role in this sinister story are dead or out of the way. That will not change anything anyway because the case is now closed since the main yet undeclared suspect is dead. The real question is to know whether the police, the various police departments concerned did their job properly, if the inspectors did theirs and if their hierarchy supported them. It's always difficult to say especially with the role of the Attorney general or public prosecutor in the area. There are so many elements that may stop an investigation in the USA, particularly elections since the main characters in security forces are elected and local officials are the bosses of the Police. A lot can be said and a lot can be done, or undone or just not done. And that seems to be the case here.

That's just one example of how lovingly and accurately -- great period soundtrack too -- the movie recreates the San Francisco of the late 60's and 70's.  The violence of the murders is neither sensationalized or ignored, but necessary to portraying the killer.  Nonetheless, the knife murders in particular are graphic.  Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr are all excellent, particularly Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo in their scenes together as the trail goes cold for the cop but Gyllenhaal delves ever deeper and dangerously into the case, even at the cost to his personal life.  The movie runs over two hours, but feels a half hour shorter.  (Warning -- spoiler coming in the next sentence.)  But I left the theater feeling that the time spent by Gyllenhaal in pursuing what turns out to be a false suspect was a bit arbitrary as a plot device to drag out the who-dunnit aspect of the case.

His haunting by the case inspired his first movie ever about serial killers, the beautiful and memorably cruel SE7EN, and then later resulted in this extremely elaborate recreation of the Zodiac's murders and the attempts by three men (a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, his reporter colleague, and a local detective) in solving the killer's identity (which to this day remains officially unsolved, though the film makes clear who the three men think committed the murders). By focusing on the puzzle-solvers rather than on the committing of the crimes themselves (which are disposed of nearly completely in the film's first half) or the victims, Fincher is truer to his interests but makes a duller and less engaging movie than he might have otherwise. He seems to care very little about the Zodiac's victims or their families or the survivors of his crimes. The murders are re-staged with painstaking scrupulousness to detail, but except for a lovely beginning sequence of two of the most famous of the Zodiac's victims meeting to drive to a lover's lane amidst a trippy Independence Day evening celebration in a local neighborhood, there's no sense of the victims really as people at all. The stakes of the film are thus not very high: all you care about in the end is seeing the puzzle solved for its own sake.Exacerbating the problem is the thinness of the three central protagonists. Although Jake Gyllenhaal brings his beautiful haunted eyes to the role of the cartoonist, he doesn't really flesh out the part beyond the descriptors of ""obsessed"" and ""former Eagle Scout."" Robert Downey Jr. relies on tricks he uses far too often playing yet another loveable mouthy screw-up with substance abuse problems; only Mark Ruffalo, as his darkest and most intense, seems to generate much heat as the grouchy detective. There are beautiful sequences in the film, mostly at what would be its most difficult junctures, i.e. to show the considerable passing of time: one involves a beautiful CGI re-creation of the building of the Transamerica Pyramid (via simulated time-lapse photography). Fincher is marvelous as solving technical problems but fails to solve the larger problem of making the story involving for audiences not as obsessed with the Zodiac case as he himself already is. The film is much longer than it needed to be, and much less exciting. The two-disc director's cut is worth seeing for two excellent appended documentaries, one about the case against Arthur Leigh Allen, the prime suspect in the case, and the other (of particular beauty and elegance) about the four certain murderous attacks of the Zodiac killer, which involves interviews with the detectives and policemen originally on the cases and the two survivors of the attacks.",3,Mission: Interminable,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,3008,"['When', 'child', 'growing', 'up', 'Bay', 'Area', 'was', 'told', 'father', 'notorious', 'serial', 'killer', 'Zodiac', 'had', 'announced', 'was', 'targeting', 'children', 'school', 'buses', 'David', 'Fincher', 'discovered', 'ultimate', 'boogeyman', 'childhood', 'haunting', 'case', 'inspired', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'serial', 'killers', 'beautiful', 'memorably', 'cruel', 'SE7EN', 'then', 'later', 'resulted', 'extremely', 'elaborate', 'recreation', 'Zodiac', 'murders', 'attempts', 'three', 'men', 'cartoonist', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'reporter', 'colleague', 'local', 'detective', 'solving', 'killer', 'identity', 'day', 'officially', 'unsolved', 'film', 'clear', 'who', 'three', 'men', 'think', 'committed', 'murders', 'focusing', 'puzzle-solvers', 'rather', 'committing', 'crimes', 'are', 'disposed', 'nearly', 'completely', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'victims', 'Fincher', 'truer', 'interests', 'duller', 'less', 'engaging', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'otherwise', 'care', 'very', 'little', 'Zodiac', 'victims', 'families', 'survivors', 'crimes', 'murders', 'are', 're-staged', 'painstaking', 'scrupulousness', 'detail', 'lovely', 'beginning', 'sequence', 'two', 'most', 'famous', 'Zodiac', 'victims', 'meeting', 'drive', 'lover', 'lane', 'amidst', 'trippy', 'Independence', 'Day', 'evening', 'celebration', 'local', 'neighborhood', 'sense', 'victims', 'really', 'people', 'stakes', 'film', 'are', 'thus', 'not', 'very', 'high', 'care', 'end', 'seeing', 'puzzle', 'solved', 'own', 'sake.Exacerbating', 'problem', 'thinness', 'three', 'central', 'protagonists', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'beautiful', 'haunted', 'eyes', 'role', 'cartoonist', ""n't"", 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'part', 'descriptors', 'obsessed', 'former', 'Eagle', 'Scout', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'relies', 'tricks', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'playing', 'yet', 'loveable', 'mouthy', 'screw-up', 'substance', 'abuse', 'problems', 'only', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'darkest', 'most', 'intense', 'generate', 'much', 'heat', 'grouchy', 'detective', 'are', 'beautiful', 'sequences', 'film', 'mostly', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'difficult', 'junctures', 'i.e', 'show', 'considerable', 'passing', 'time', 'one', 'beautiful', 'CGI', 're-creation', 'building', 'Transamerica', 'Pyramid', 'simulated', 'time-lapse', 'photography', 'Fincher', 'marvelous', 'solving', 'technical', 'problems', 'solve', 'larger', 'problem', 'making', 'story', 'involving', 'audiences', 'not', 'obsessed', 'Zodiac', 'case', 'already', 'film', 'much', 'longer', 'needed', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'exciting', 'two-disc', 'director', 'cut', 'worth', 'seeing', 'two', 'excellent', 'appended', 'documentaries', 'one', 'case', 'Arthur', 'Leigh', 'Allen', 'prime', 'suspect', 'case', 'other', 'particular', 'beauty', 'elegance', 'four', 'certain', 'murderous', 'attacks', 'Zodiac', 'killer', 'interviews', 'detectives', 'policemen', 'originally', 'cases', 'two', 'survivors', 'attacks']",N/A

If you're willing to commit yourself for three hours and are looking for something more than just another ""what a sick f**k!"" film you're in for a disturbing, almost uncomfortably involving ride not through the mind of a killer, but through the mind of more or less innocent people who are torn apart by their inability to find him.I wouldn't call David Fincher a ""great director"" quite yet, but he's getting there: this movie proves that he isn't he just another renegade from MTV who got his hands on a camera.  Keep in mind, though: this is nothing like ""Seven"". (And fortunately for everyone it isn't anything like ""Panic Room"".)  That was more a work of dark imagination than anything else; this is horribly factual and only leaves a little bit out as far the actual case goes.  Robert Downey Jr., Brian Cox, Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal especially give very human, believable performances--almost to the point where you forget you're watching a movie.The Zodiac Killer was an erratic, power-minded psychopath whose reign of terror in Northern California is remembered very well by those who lived through it.  His reign of terror lasted from the late 60's to the early 70's, a fairly brief period of time for the average serial killer: but the Zodiac seemed more interested in playing power games with law enforcement--Mark Ruffalo plays David Toschi, the stressed out cop who had the misfortune of having to handle the case, and though most of the Zodiac's ""codes"" and messages seem at first to be directed toward ridiculing his status as a police officer, he keeps his cool as much as possible.Toschi was a tough cookie though, and a trained police officer.  Such was not the case with the Zodiac's more vulnerable prey, played by Robert Downey Jr. and Jake Gyllenhaal.  One is a reporter for the SF chronicle, the other is a cartoonist who should really have nothing to do with the case at all.  The Zodiac, with the sadistic sixth sense characteristic of murderers, lock onto both the these men and slowly suck the joy our of their lives while making them paranoid, fearful, and terminally obsessed with identifying the killer.  Spending their time getting drunk and trying to crack the puzzles sent in after each murder, the incomprehensibility of the situation brings them both to the brink of madness.Downey's character is already a little vulnerable (and he was great in this movie, people just slander him constantly because he's had very public substance abuse problems in my opinion) and frustrated.  He becomes non-functional and cracks while Glyenhaal's Robert Graysmith lets everything else in his life go to hell while pursuing the Zodiac long after the case is closed.The violence in this movie is more minimal than one would expect considering the subject.  There is one unforgettably horrifying scene with a couple who the Zodiac murdered in a SF park.  It is filmed with such distance and nonchalance that it chills right to the bone. No suspenseful music, nothing; just cold blooded, random murder.This does film does not have a happy or satisfying ending at all.  This is appropriate because the case did not have a happy ending; Arthur Lee Allen, a convicted child molester and a man of other blatantly deviant tendencies, is generally believed to have been the Zodiac.  He succesfully evaded capture and suffered a heart attack before he was formally charged with killings.  The last scene, in which Robert Graysmith finally gets what he wants and stands face to face with him, is in some ways more bone chilling than anything else in the film.  The expression on Allen's face is indescribably awful and smug.These killings took place in a time when some very basic technology was lacking in terms of law enforcement.  I doubt this could be pulled off with such evil braggadacio in the contemporary world, but the damage is already done.  The thing that concerns about movies as well done as this one is that they are based on actual cases, not even slightly distanced from real names and events.  It resurrects events--artfully--which certain diseased minds may want to recreate.  Not to say movies like this shouldn't be made, I certainly enjoyed it, but I sometimes think it would be better if aliases were used with respect to the people and suspects involved as a cautionary measure.  At any rate, a not just good but great film.",5,Brilliant,1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,4578,"['Suffice', 'say', 'Zodiac', 'not', 'people', 'limited', 'attention', 'span', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'jollies', 'watching', 'scene', 'scene', 'brutal', 'murder', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', ""'re"", 'willing', 'commit', 'three', 'hours', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'what', 'sick', 'f**k', 'film', ""'re"", 'disturbing', 'almost', 'uncomfortably', 'involving', 'ride', 'not', 'mind', 'killer', 'mind', 'more', 'less', 'innocent', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'torn', 'apart', 'inability', 'find', 'him.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'David', 'Fincher', 'great', 'director', 'quite', 'yet', 'getting', 'there', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'renegade', 'MTV', 'who', 'got', 'hands', 'camera', 'Keep', 'mind', 'nothing', 'Seven', 'fortunately', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'anything', 'Panic', 'Room', 'was', 'more', 'work', 'dark', 'imagination', 'anything', 'else', 'horribly', 'factual', 'only', 'little', 'bit', 'out', 'far', 'actual', 'case', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'especially', 'give', 'very', 'human', 'believable', 'performances', 'almost', 'point', 'where', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie.The', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'was', 'erratic', 'power-minded', 'psychopath', 'reign', 'terror', 'Northern', 'California', 'remembered', 'very', 'well', 'who', 'lived', 'reign', 'terror', 'lasted', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'fairly', 'brief', 'period', 'time', 'average', 'serial', 'killer', 'Zodiac', 'seemed', 'more', 'interested', 'playing', 'power', 'games', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'David', 'Toschi', 'stressed', 'out', 'cop', 'who', 'had', 'misfortune', 'having', 'handle', 'case', 'most', 'Zodiac', 'codes', 'messages', 'seem', 'first', 'be', 'directed', 'ridiculing', 'status', 'police', 'officer', 'cool', 'as', 'much', 'possible.Toschi', 'was', 'tough', 'cookie', 'trained', 'police', 'officer', 'Such', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Zodiac', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'prey', 'played', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'One', 'reporter', 'SF', 'chronicle', 'other', 'cartoonist', 'who', 'should', 'really', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'case', 'Zodiac', 'sadistic', 'sixth', 'sense', 'characteristic', 'murderers', 'lock', 'men', 'slowly', 'suck', 'joy', 'lives', 'making', 'paranoid', 'fearful', 'terminally', 'obsessed', 'identifying', 'killer', 'Spending', 'time', 'getting', 'drunk', 'trying', 'crack', 'puzzles', 'sent', 'murder', 'incomprehensibility', 'situation', 'brink', 'madness.Downey', 'character', 'already', 'little', 'vulnerable', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'people', 'just', 'slander', 'constantly', 'had', 'very', 'public', 'substance', 'abuse', 'problems', 'opinion', 'frustrated', 'non-functional', 'cracks', 'Glyenhaal', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'everything', 'else', 'life', 'go', 'hell', 'pursuing', 'Zodiac', 'long', 'case', 'closed.The', 'violence', 'movie', 'more', 'minimal', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'considering', 'subject', 'one', 'unforgettably', 'horrifying', 'scene', 'couple', 'who', 'Zodiac', 'murdered', 'SF', 'park', 'filmed', 'such', 'distance', 'nonchalance', 'right', 'bone', 'suspenseful', 'music', 'nothing', 'just', 'cold', 'blooded', 'random', 'murder.This', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'appropriate', 'case', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'Arthur', 'Lee', 'Allen', 'convicted', 'child', 'molester', 'man', 'other', 'blatantly', 'deviant', 'tendencies', 'generally', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'Zodiac', 'succesfully', 'evaded', 'capture', 'suffered', 'heart', 'attack', 'was', 'formally', 'charged', 'killings', 'last', 'scene', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'finally', 'what', 'face', 'face', 'ways', 'more', 'bone', 'chilling', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'expression', 'Allen', 'face', 'indescribably', 'awful', 'smug.These', 'killings', 'took', 'place', 'time', 'when', 'very', 'basic', 'technology', 'was', 'lacking', 'terms', 'law', 'enforcement', 'doubt', 'could', 'be', 'pulled', 'off', 'such', 'evil', 'braggadacio', 'contemporary', 'world', 'damage', 'already', 'done', 'thing', 'concerns', 'about', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'cases', 'not', 'even', 'slightly', 'distanced', 'real', 'names', 'events', 'events', 'artfully', 'certain', 'diseased', 'minds', 'may', 'want', 'recreate', 'Not', 'say', 'movies', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'sometimes', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'aliases', 'were', 'used', 'respect', 'people', 'involved', 'cautionary', 'measure', 'rate', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'great', 'film']",N/A

Everyone who even resembled that sketch of him was suspect in our eyes.Zodiac does a great job of placing you right into the 70's.

It's a bit longer than most but that was ok, since I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It had suspense, authenticity and great performances all around. The only problem was that I kept thinking, ""I thought they never caught the Zodiac killer, but how could they have made a movie about the case if they didn't?"". Well, my memory was correct about the killer never being caught, and that was the biggest disappointment about this movie. Instead of having the satisfaction of seeing Jake Gyllenhall track down the Zodiac to some abandoned warehouse, where our hero would be overpowered by the killer and on the verge of getting skewered before Mark Ruffalo appeared unexpectedly and put a bullet through the Zodiac's heart, we are left with a ""climax"" of seeing everyone connected with the investigation frustrated and disappointed. It's a bracing but perhaps salutary antidote to our pop-culture of happy endings to see such reality in a Hollywood film. Things sometimes....check that...things_usually_don't work out the way we want them to, but it is a man's duty, and compulsion (which this movie accurately shows women not understanding) to be true to his calling- in this case the pursuit of justice- no matter the obstacles, and that his efforts are still commendable even if their ultimate result is failure. Besides that didactic lesson, the movie provides a fascinating look inside the puzzle-solving nitty-gritty of police work, which was a bit more reliant on the human mind in the pre-computer age. So, my verdict is that this was a winner.As an aside, all the movies and publicity about the Zodiac killer, with his 5 known victims, stands in stark contrast to the media blackout of the Zebra killings, which claimed 71 innocents in San Francisco during the same time period. In that case, a gang of Black Islamic serial killers ritually butchered 71 men and women because they were White. The Black community of San Francisco impeded the investigation and showed no sympathy with the victims. At least one Black police officer conspired with the killers to try and murder a witness against them. Don't you think that would make a compelling drama? Yet, only 2 books have ever been written about the killings, and San Francisco has done its best to throw the case down the memory hole. Hollywood refuses to touch the story because it's politically incorrect. The Zodiac killings deserve remembering, but the Soviet-style deletion of the Zebra killings from public acknowledgment is a perfect example of the second-class status Whites victims have in the eyes of our ruling class when their killers are members of a privileged group.

1076800,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B000QUCNOU,Joe Carugati,"[5, 5]","I've always been a huge fan of David Fincher and his work (including ""Alien 3""). The look of his films are always magnificent and perfectly capture the mood the film is trying to convey. To this day, ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club"" were my top two favorite films of his. Now, I can bump off ""Fight Club"" and put ""Zodiac"" in its place.The story of the film begins in the late 60's in San Francisco, CA. A man, who calls himself the ""Zodiac"", has begun to kill people and leaves the police and the San Francisco Chronicle with letters and cryptic messages about who he is and why he's killing people. Throughout the story, different people are drawn into the case, trying to figure out the clues and who the killer could be.Let me just say that this is a film that will not give you a clear conclusion at the end of the story. The Zodiac killer was never actually found. There was a prime suspect, but to this day, the case is still in the open.Knowing this information (like I did) before seeing the film, makes one enjoy it even more. The film is not really about the Zodiac himself, but more about the people searching for him and the theme of obsession. Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr, Anthony Edwards, and Mark Ruffalo all turn in marvelous performances as people with different roles trying to find answers. Some lose themselves to the case, while others thrive on it disgustingly.The film moves at a slow, deliberate pace, but every scene is intense, be it through dialogue, atmosphere, or shot composition. As long as the film was, it never truly felt like it and cutting it in any way, would have ruined the whole.The killings themselves are shown only in the first half, but they will stay with you until the end of the film. They are shown in graphic, realistic detail and that only makes them more shocking. The scene at Lake Berryessa had me (and the rest of the people in the room) freaking out. Disturbing, but not ridiculous.Director David Fincher is a favorite of mine. From ""The Game"" to ""Panic Room"" to this, he's always impressed me with his visual style and direction. He seems a bit more suppressed here (no zany camera angles, fast edits, obscure shots) and that really helps the movie along. As I said before, it's not supposed to be a fast paced film and people looking for a slasher film will not like it. Even though it moves slow though, there are many scenes that will give you shivers, mainly the killings, the ending (brrr...), and a scene that takes place in a basement with Jake Gyllenhaal's character. I won't ruin it, but it really got to me.Overall, ""Zodiac"" was a film that I really had no intention of seeing. I heard it was long and not much happens at all. Well, I'm glad I got around to viewing it.

1076806,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000QUCNOU,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","While ""Zodiac"" treads familar territory, with themes that existed in films like ""Summer of Sam"" and ""The Black Dahlia,"" it succeeds and becomes a much better film than those two for it's sheer filmmaking brilliance. David Fincher is a great director, who's directed audience favorites ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club"" but ""Zodiac"" is his finest achievement as a director. I had the same first impression with the film that many people had. How can somebody make a compelling film about a case that was never solved? Fincher makes it look easy. This is probably the 2nd best film of 2007 (behind ""Black Snake Moan"") and is worthy of Oscar nominations. The film is based on a book by Robert Graysmith, a former cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, who is the main character of the film and is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Graysmith's book has been blasted for just how accurate it is, but if the fact's are close to what we see in the film...Then this is a very haunting story. The films opens with a young couple being gunned down on the 4th of July and then switches to The San Francisco Chronicle building, where the editor receives a letter from a person claiming to be the killer. Pretty soon, reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) begins writing articles about the killer (who dubs him the Zodiac), while Graysmith grows more-and-more interested in the case. Meanwhile, David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) investigates the case while obsession slowly grips him. Now, I compared this film to ""Summer of Sam"" and ""The Black Dahlia."" I want to add that this film is massively superior to both, but I make the comparion because ""Summer of Sam"" is about an actual murderer and the way his murders affected the people living in the same place. ""The Black Dahlia"" is about an unsolved murder and deals with the way obsession grips the main characters trying to solve the case. ""Zodiac"" would work as a ficitional film, because of how compelling it is. In one scene where Graysmith meets up with a man who he slowly grows to believe may be the Zodiac was one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen on film recently. As for John Caroll Lynch, who plays the most likely Zodiac suspect (although he was cleared due to handwriting and fingerprint evidence) plays the character perfectly. His final scene in the film is very haunting. The final scene itself is one of the most haunting in the film. Gyllenhaal is terrific as Graysmith, the adult Boy Scout; But it's Downey Jr. that steals the show! It's too bad this film was released so early in the year, because Downey Jr. deserves an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Avery delivers some of the best one-liners and there's a lot of subtle touches that go hand-in-hand with the character that just make him so great. I'm curious how accurate and factually correct this film is, but that doesn't matter. It's a film that uses a lot of restraint in the blood-and-gore department and is almost Hitchcockian in the way it handles suspense and terror. I loved this movie, it was everything a person could desire from a film. Even with a 2 hour and 40 minute running time, it's always compelling, interesting, and entertaining.GRADE: A",5,One of the Best Films of 2007,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,3169,"['Zodiac', 'familar', 'territory', 'themes', 'existed', 'films', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'two', 'sheer', 'filmmaking', 'brilliance', 'David', 'Fincher', 'great', 'director', 'who', 'directed', 'audience', 'Se7en', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Zodiac', 'finest', 'achievement', 'director', 'had', 'same', 'first', 'impression', 'film', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'How', 'can', 'somebody', 'make', 'compelling', 'film', 'case', 'was', 'never', 'solved', 'Fincher', 'look', 'easy', 'probably', '2nd', 'best', 'film', '2007', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'former', 'cartoonist', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'played', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Graysmith', 'book', 'been', 'blasted', 'just', 'how', 'accurate', 'fact', 'are', 'close', 'what', 'see', 'film', 'Then', 'very', 'haunting', 'story', 'films', 'young', 'couple', 'being', 'gunned', 'down', '4th', 'July', 'then', 'switches', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'building', 'where', 'editor', 'letter', 'person', 'claiming', 'be', 'killer', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'reporter', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'writing', 'articles', 'killer', 'who', 'dubs', 'Zodiac', 'Graysmith', 'more-and-more', 'interested', 'case', 'Meanwhile', 'David', 'Toschi', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'case', 'obsession', 'slowly', 'Now', 'compared', 'film', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'want', 'add', 'film', 'massively', 'superior', 'make', 'comparion', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'actual', 'murderer', 'way', 'murders', 'affected', 'people', 'living', 'same', 'place', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'deals', 'way', 'obsession', 'main', 'characters', 'trying', 'solve', 'case', 'Zodiac', 'would', 'work', 'ficitional', 'film', 'how', 'compelling', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Graysmith', 'up', 'man', 'who', 'slowly', 'believe', 'may', 'be', 'Zodiac', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'recently', 'John', 'Caroll', 'Lynch', 'who', 'most', 'likely', 'Zodiac', 'suspect', 'was', 'cleared', 'due', 'handwriting', 'fingerprint', 'evidence', 'character', 'perfectly', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'very', 'haunting', 'final', 'scene', 'one', 'most', 'haunting', 'film', 'Gyllenhaal', 'terrific', 'Graysmith', 'adult', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'show', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'so', 'early', 'year', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Avery', 'best', 'one-liners', 'lot', 'subtle', 'touches', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', 'character', 'just', 'make', 'so', 'great', ""'m"", 'curious', 'how', 'accurate', 'factually', 'correct', 'film', ""n't"", 'matter', 'film', 'lot', 'restraint', 'blood-and-gore', 'department', 'almost', 'Hitchcockian', 'way', 'suspense', 'terror', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'everything', 'person', 'could', 'desire', 'film', 'Even', '2', 'hour', '40', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'always', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'entertaining.GRADE']",N/A

David Fincher (FIGHT CLUB, PANIC ROOM, SEVEN) directs this dazziling masterpiece that could only be better if it was longer. I only say that because the movie is so fascinating that I ran out after the movie and bought both of Robert Graysmith's books on the subject ""ZODIAC"" & ""ZODIAC UNMASKED"". The film is based on BOTH books. Jake Gyllenhaal (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, JARHEAD, DONNIE DARKO) plays Graysmith in the film and is marvelous as the obsessed cartoonist. The film also stars the always magnificent Robert Downey Jr. (IRON MAN 1 & 2, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, CHAPLIN) as Paul Avery a reporter investigating the Zodiac murders for the San Fancisco Chronicle.

1076810,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000QUCNOU,Kaya Savas,"[8, 11]","MOVIE: David Fincher has become a name that makes people sit up and take notice. His body of work is small, but I think we can look at it as quality over quantity. Terrence Malick is another director who has a small body of work, but every time he makes a film he knocks the ball right out of the park. The same goes for David Fincher, he has not made a bad film yet in his career and yes I am counting Alien 3. With films like Se7en, The Game, Fight Club and Panic Room I think it is safe to say that the man can direct and can tell a gripping and thrilling tale. He is one of my favorite directors and in some ways is a modern day Hitchcock.The film itself chronicles a period of time during the 1960's and the 1970's. I think what will surprise most people going into this movie is that this is not your typical serial killer movie. So, if you're expecting another Se7en then you're going into the movie with the wrong state of mind. I am incredibly happy that Fincher went with a different side to the genre and didn't repeat himself. We open the movie with the first murder that sparked the chaos. The rest of the film shows how obsession consumes the characters and the lives of everyone involved. James Vanderbilt constructed the screenplay so that there is really no main character here. The story shifts focus amongst the different characters, and that's why the film needs to be as long as it is. Even though the focus shifts around a lot we never lose focus on any of the characters, every single one is thoroughly developed. The screenplay is incredibly captivating despite throwing so much information at the audience.  We are with this story until the very end and are in no way being dragged by the arm. Also just as important is the ending. How do you end a film where the outcome is publically known? I won't say, but our characters complete their journey and that's the most important part and it does serve closure. You will not be disappointed with an open ending.Let's move to the technical aspects of the film. The number one reason I get excited about a Fincher film is the cinematography, and boy oh boy does Zodiac have perfect cinematography. David Fincher decided to use the Thompson Viper FilmStream Camera to shoot the entire film on uncompressed digital. This is the first time Fincher has shot digital, and the first time a Hollywood film has used the Viper camera to film in uncompressed digital. It makes perfect sense for Fincher to use this method since his films are almost always shot at night for the most part, and with digital you need less light to film. With that being said the picture is very soft and the atmosphere is indescribable in words. Lighting is perfect in every scene, it seems as if each light in the frame is glowing, there are no harsh shadows. The color palette is very muted and the film captures the time period perfectly especially within the art direction and costume design. Harris Savides was the Director of Photography on the film. He worked as an assistant photographer on Se7en so I'm sure he had a good sense of what Fincher was going for, and it certainly shows that he did. The look of the film has Fincher's name all over it. Some scenes will remind you of Panic Room while others will remind you of Fight Club, and as a whole the film has the feel of Se7en and The Game. The pacing is absolutely perfect and there will be some scenes that will have you curl up in anticipation and tension.Another aspect of the film worth mentioning was the score composed by veteran composer David Shire. I was almost devastated when I found out that Howard Shore wouldn't be scoring Zodiac. Fincher's collaboration with him on Se7en, The Game and Panic Room was remarkable and Shore composed some of his most memorable scores with Fincher. However I can see why Shore could have been a misfit with this movie, and I think David Shire did an excellent job. David Fincher wanted to do a more character driven film in the vein of All The President's Men. I don't think it's a coincidence that David Shire also composed the score to All The President's Men. Zodiac isn't structured like most films and the movie has almost no score anyway. You do have to acknowledge the music supervisors' selection of period songs to create the right mood and tone. I really didn't even notice the score until the third act of the film. Even though I love my movies with strong scores I never felt there was a need for it, and that credit has to go to Fincher's magnificent capability to thrill us through the filmmaking itself. Zodiac is as detailed as it gets and it's brilliant.ACTING: The cast is remarkable. Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance in my opinion. He comes across as a very thorough person who always likes to understand everything, and then the Zodiac case itself consumes him.  Robert Downey Jr. is equally brilliant as Paul Avery, the reporter who becomes obsessed with the case and goes down a path of self destruction. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play two inspectors who are partners. Edward's character quits before it grabs a hold of him while Ruffalo's character continues down the path. The performances are absolutely amazing, this is truly one of the best efforts I have seen from a cast as a whole in awhile.BOTTOM LINE: The film is atmospheric and will envelope you from beginning to end. Your heart rate will rise during some scenes and you will be tense with anxiety and anticipation. The characters will captivate you and you will become as obsessed with the case as the characters are. David Fincher turned out a very mature, intricate and entertaining film.

1076811,A2DB720I9XRX7K,B000QUCNOU,K. Draper,"[3, 3]","I enjoyed ""Zodiac"" quite a bit.  The acting is mostly excellent, the story is interesting, the visuals are effective, and the sound track is good. That is, like a good sound-track, it underscores the film without attracting attention to itself. A couple of period hit-singles are also used, including Donovan's 1968 ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"", which plays at the outset, and then accompanies the opening scene and initial murder.The violence is graphic, though not intolerable.  In fact, even though I am definitely not a fan of horror shows, I am impressed by the ""execution"" of the stabbing sequence during the second murder.  Mostly indirect, but very convincing--especially when the girl's body rolls toward the knife. AND the camera.  Powerful.  In a later scene, he threatens a young mother whom he given a lift, that ""before I kill you, I'm going to throw your baby out the window"".  Thankfully we don't have to watch anyone being hurled out or mutilated.  She gets away.  Her fear is then compellingly portrayed by her maniacal behavior when she flags down the driver of a truck heading straight toward her.Several actors turn in stellar performances in this gruesome epic. Robert Downy, jr. really knows how to play the cynical alcoholic journalist, Paul Avery.  Avery is one of people whose lives were destroyed in the wake of Zodiac's killings and menacing threats.  Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of the tenacious inspector David Toschi  is also quiet engaging.  Jake Gyllenhaal is good, but he seems a little too guileless to play the part of author Robert Greysmith.  He's fine as the ""boy scout"" sweet single dad who works as a political cartoonist and likes reading and puzzles.  But as the obsessed amateur sleuth who sacfices his family life and everything else in his life to dedicate to study, solve and write about Zodiac, he is less convincing.Then there's Arthur Leigh Allen, played by John Carol Lynch. Mega creepy, but not over-the-top.  Some people say that in writing his book, Graysmith manipulates the data in order to try to ""prove"" that Leigh is Zodiac.  That may well be, but in the movie version, Lee Allen, with his zodiac watch and wing-walker shoes, is obviously the killer. The people can't pin it on him because the evidence is circumstantial.  Whatever.  Enjoy it as fiction, and Lynch's ""Lee Allen"" will chill your soul.  Especially at the closing scene, when he and Greysmith lock eyes in recognition.  ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" plays again, now sounding eerie and ominous.  Punchy, slovenly, creepy, Hurdy Gurdy, Zodiac Serial Killer Man. Shiver.",4,"Thank-you David Fincher--I'll never be able to listen to ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" again without getting the creeps.",1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,2565,"['enjoyed', 'Zodiac', 'quite', 'bit', 'acting', 'mostly', 'excellent', 'story', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'are', 'effective', 'sound', 'track', 'good', 'good', 'sound-track', 'film', 'attracting', 'attention', 'couple', 'period', 'hit-singles', 'are', 'also', 'used', 'including', 'Donovan', '1968', 'Hurdy', 'Gurdy', 'Man', 'outset', 'then', 'opening', 'scene', 'initial', 'murder.The', 'violence', 'graphic', 'not', 'intolerable', 'fact', 'even', 'am', 'definitely', 'not', 'fan', 'horror', 'shows', 'am', 'impressed', 'execution', 'stabbing', 'sequence', 'second', 'murder', 'Mostly', 'indirect', 'very', 'convincing', 'especially', 'when', 'girl', 'body', 'knife', 'camera', 'Powerful', 'later', 'scene', 'young', 'mother', 'whom', 'given', 'lift', 'kill', ""'m"", 'going', 'throw', 'baby', 'window', 'Thankfully', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'anyone', 'being', 'hurled', 'out', 'mutilated', 'away', 'fear', 'then', 'compellingly', 'portrayed', 'maniacal', 'behavior', 'when', 'flags', 'down', 'driver', 'truck', 'heading', 'straight', 'her.Several', 'actors', 'turn', 'stellar', 'performances', 'gruesome', 'epic', 'Robert', 'Downy', 'jr.', 'really', 'how', 'play', 'cynical', 'alcoholic', 'journalist', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'Avery', 'one', 'people', 'lives', 'were', 'destroyed', 'wake', 'Zodiac', 'killings', 'menacing', 'threats', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'portrayal', 'tenacious', 'inspector', 'David', 'Toschi', 'also', 'quiet', 'engaging', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'good', 'little', 'too', 'guileless', 'play', 'part', 'author', 'Robert', 'Greysmith', 'fine', 'boy', 'scout', 'sweet', 'single', 'dad', 'who', 'political', 'cartoonist', 'likes', 'reading', 'puzzles', 'obsessed', 'amateur', 'sleuth', 'who', 'family', 'life', 'everything', 'else', 'life', 'dedicate', 'study', 'solve', 'write', 'Zodiac', 'less', 'convincing.Then', 'Arthur', 'Leigh', 'Allen', 'played', 'John', 'Carol', 'Lynch', 'Mega', 'creepy', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'people', 'say', 'writing', 'book', 'Graysmith', 'data', 'order', 'try', 'prove', 'Leigh', 'Zodiac', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'movie', 'version', 'Lee', 'Allen', 'zodiac', 'watch', 'wing-walker', 'shoes', 'obviously', 'killer', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pin', 'evidence', 'circumstantial', 'Enjoy', 'fiction', 'Lynch', 'Lee', 'Allen', 'will', 'chill', 'soul', 'Especially', 'closing', 'scene', 'when', 'Greysmith', 'lock', 'eyes', 'recognition', 'Hurdy', 'Gurdy', 'Man', 'again', 'now', 'sounding', 'eerie', 'ominous', 'Punchy', 'slovenly', 'creepy', 'Hurdy', 'Gurdy', 'Zodiac', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'Man', 'Shiver']",N/A

Zodiac isn't just the story of the hunt for the killer, but an exploration of many characters obsessed and/or involved with the long cold case: Cartoonist turned-writer-detective Robert Graysmith is played with quirky excellence by Jake Gyllenhaal; Robert Downey Jr. is brillant as the self-absorbed strung-out reporter Paul Avery who tries help crack the Zodiac's code, Mark Ruffalo plays Detective Dave Toschi ( the inspiration for Steve McQueen)seek out the identity of the killer along with his partner played by Anthony Edwards.The movie doesn't just focus on the killer, or even the search for him, but the details of period, and their lives. Like UK TV series ""Life on Mars"" the stark difference between present-day police procedure and the 70's. This is defined neatly by a scene in which Edwards character struggles to coordinate their efforts with other law enforcement districts. Also the obsession nearly causes Graysmith to lose his family.I don't usually go for the ""based on a true-story"" type of movie or crime dramas based on actual events, but I thought this one was superb.

As though to show time changing, Fincher calls in all his CGI friends to building the Transamerica Pyramid (600 Montgomery Street) before our eyes, and eventually leaves it as another tall, lit-up silhouette on the famous horizon.  Better than anything else, the Pyramid shows the difference between the new and the old city.Anthony Edwards makes an amazing return (and his hair does too) playing Bill Armstrong, the lead detective on the case and the partner of Dave Toschi, an outspoken Italian-American cop played in colorful, John-Garfield-in-Tortilla-Flat style by Mark Ruffalo.  I nearly didn't recognize Ruffalo without Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Garner playing opposite him, but here he is as the man's man many think that Dirty Harry Callahan was based on, and he's almost convincing.  As a pas de trois between three fabulously talented male stars (Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhall, and Robert Downey Jr.) ZODIAC is never boring, and whenever Anthony Edwards comes on screen the movie rises up another notch.Maybe the women don't do so well, though Clea Duvall is striking as the jailbird sister of one of the very first Zodiac victims.  But whoever is playing Ruffalo's wife has almost nothing to do except cast knowing silhouettes, and Chloe Sevigny, as the love interest for Robert Downy Jr's character, looks sour throughout, like someone was feeding her lemon flavored epsom salts through a tube.  Ciara Hughes makes an astounding screen debut as the mysterious Darlene Ferrin; you can believe that whoever committed the Zodiac murders knew her well and wanted to know her better.  I expect this beautiful young actress will have a great career in Hollywood, if she wants one.But basically you will want to know how creepy the show is--and the answer is plenty.  The movie begins with a radio segue, from Three Dog Night singing ""Easy to be Hard"" into the acid-rock freakout of John Paul Bonham, Alan Parker, Jimmy Page proto Led Zep of Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" as the suspense and the darkness ratchet up.  Putside the theater the marquee blinked on and off all evening, ""WHY DID THE KILLER STOP KILLING?  IS HE STILL ALIVE?  COULD HE BE SITTING NEXT TO YOU?""

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 13]","As the beginning of any new year rolls around, after awards season, there tends to be a significant drop off in quality or what you might call serious drama. Usually we're left with crowd pleasing, if not critically acclaimed comedy, or low budget horror until the kickoff of the summer season. There are a few gems that sneak in once in a while (perhaps the most notorious was ""Silence of the Lambs"" with its oddly timed Valentine's opening), but as a generalization--this is true more often than not. So David Fincher's ""Zodiac,"" which make no mistake is a drama and not a thriller, is a welcome respite from traditional fare released at this time of the year. Fincher, who made an artistic splash with ""Se7en,"" ""The Game,"" and ""Fight Club,"" had been noticeably absent since hitting it big with the more routine ""Panic Room"" in 2002. Eschewing the sensationalistic approaches a film of this type might employ, Fincher has crafted a sprawling and ambitious investigative drama about the men whose lives were changed in the obsessive hunt for a serial killer known only as Zodiac.For those unfamiliar with the story, I will borrow an excerpt from my review on ""The Zodiac"" (a lesser film that covers some of the same ground, but concentrating more on Zodiac's earlier murders in Vallejo). ""Over a period of years during the sixties and seventies, the San Francisco area was plagued by a series of seemingly random murders perpetuated by a man known only as the Zodiac killer. Using the press and taunting the police, Zodiac became one of the more prominent ""celebrity"" serial killers with his need to be in the spotlight."" Fincher's film focuses primarily on three major characters, although a huge cast contributes to this complex tale. There is David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) who is the lead police investigator when the Zodiac moved to San Francisco, Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) who is the star reporter covering the case for the San Francisco Chronicle, and Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is a cartoonist at the Chronicle who becomes obsessed with the case. In fact, Graysmith's obsession turned into the book which serves as source material for this film.Clearly, the strongpoint of the film is in the performances. Downey is impeccable in self destructive mode, recapturing some of the energy and unpredictability that made him a star in the first place. Ruffalo is great, persistence turning into frustration. But it is Gyllenhaal who makes the greatest transformation from an awkward youth to someone willing to sacrifice everything to pursue an obsession. The immense cast of supporting characters are, also, well written and beautifully performed. It is in the details of the script that characters, even with limited screen time, leave a lasting and believable impression. The film, which spans decades, recreates the time frame accurately. The art direction, in particular, is spectacular when viewing this city of the recent past.The story, itself, is a procedural recounting years of work trying to locate Zodiac. Again, the script is so detailed that you really feel as if you are following the action in the same step by step fashion that the real participants must have. ""Zodiac,"" ultimately, is a smart film. It trusts that you will follow its logic, and perhaps even draw some conclusions of your own. It paints a picture of who Toschi and Graysmith believed to be Zodiac (despite evidence to the contrary), but the film is open-ended enough for you to accept this position or discount it entirely. There is plenty of intrigue as the investigation leads to unlikely places, some chilling recreations of Zodiac's killings, but most of all--real drama about real people. A great adult picture. At over 2 1/2 hours, it's a commitment--but one well worth it.

1076824,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000QUCNOU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 9]","Ultimately, the fatal flaw in ""Zodiac"" is that the film fails to maintain the courage of its convictions. Given the impulse towards narrative completeness it is difficult to make a movie about a serial killer that has never been caught, and the tagline for this 2007 film comes up with an ideal solution with the whole idea that ""There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer."" That appellation applies to a trio of characters in director David Fincher's film. Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) is the lead detective on the case and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) is covering the murders for the San Francisco ""Chronicle,"" and they are going to devote years to the pursuit of the killer. Then there is Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the paper who becomes obsessed, first with the cryptograms the Zodiac sends to the ""Chronicle"" and then with figuring out the killer's identity.The trailer for ""Zodiac"" makes it clear that Graysmith is the main character in the film, and the screenplay is based on the book that Graysmith wrote about the case. But he really does not emerge as such until the second half of the film, by which time Avery has moved on to a different paper and Toschi has put the case on the back burner, mainly because Zodiac has stopped killing. Or perhaps he has only stopped boasting about it to the press and the police. Graysmith cannot let go and continues to investigate on his own until he thinks that he knows who done it. Since the suppositions are Graysmith's, the movie bends to his perspective. Without them, the film cannot pretend to come to any conclusions. However, this runs counter to the tagline that suggests we should view Graysmith's obsession as a bad thing. ""Zodiac"" tries to walk a thin line and have it both ways but in the end it cannot help but take Greysmith's views as its own.At first I was thinking ""Zodiac"" was comparable to ""All the President's Men"" in that the focus is on police procedure and investigative journalism, and you do not actually get to a resolution except in terms of the teletype or the end scrawl. Then I could see how in many ways the Zodiac can be viewed as the American Jack the Ripper, not in terms of the viciousness of his murder but rather because the case will never be solved, so speculation as to the murderer's identity is all we have and we get to run rampant with it. Both cases have website where you can debate who are or are not the victims and see the messages that the killers sent to torment the police. So there is also a sense in which ""Zodiac"" is attempting to answer the unanswerable question, much like ""From Hell,"" albeit with much more in terms of concrete support (or at least absent evidence to the contrary).The performances by the three principle performers forgives a lot of the faults here. Downey is one of the most mesmerizing actors around today, so it is hard to keep your eye on anyone else when he is on screen. Ruffalo turns in an effectively restrained performance, providing a lot of subtle shadings within the limited range he has hit upon for this role. Gyllenhaal is the one whose character has the greatest arc from start to finish as his obsession with finding the identity of the Zodiac unhinges his life and as much as finding the killer he needs somebody, whether it be Toschi, Avery, or his wife (Chlo Sevigny) to tell him he is right. Or maybe it could be something as simple as finally getting to look into the eyes of the Zodiac himself.Next year the director's cut of ""Zodiac"" will come out on DVD, and I suppose I will check it out. But I am inclined to doubt that adding to the film will make it better because all it can really do is expand the various elements and not add additional ones. There was never sufficient proof to warrant the arrest of Graysmith's prime suspect and the film's suggestion that fate allowed time to run out speaks back to the intrinsic need for narrative completeness more than hard facts (although the movie gets points for the character of Toschi sticking to the need for proof that will stand up in court despite the circumstantial evidence that Graysmith amasses by the end of the film). Still, this version of ""Zodiac"" is well worth watching, even if it proves to be unsatisfying on various levels. The ""true"" story being told does not allow otherwise.",4,"""Zodiac"" shows that there is more than one way to lose your life to a killer",1185408000,"07 26, 2007",2007,4346,"['Ultimately', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'Zodiac', 'film', 'maintain', 'courage', 'convictions', 'Given', 'impulse', 'towards', 'narrative', 'completeness', 'difficult', 'make', 'movie', 'serial', 'killer', 'never', 'been', 'caught', 'tagline', '2007', 'film', 'up', 'ideal', 'solution', 'whole', 'idea', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'lose', 'life', 'killer', 'appellation', 'trio', 'characters', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'film', 'Inspector', 'David', 'Toschi', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'lead', 'detective', 'case', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'covering', 'murders', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'are', 'going', 'devote', 'years', 'pursuit', 'killer', 'Then', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'cartoonist', 'paper', 'who', 'obsessed', 'first', 'cryptograms', 'Zodiac', 'Chronicle', 'then', 'figuring', 'out', 'killer', 'identity.The', 'trailer', 'Zodiac', 'clear', 'Graysmith', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'screenplay', 'based', 'book', 'Graysmith', 'wrote', 'case', 'really', 'not', 'emerge', 'such', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'time', 'Avery', 'moved', 'different', 'paper', 'Toschi', 'put', 'case', 'back', 'burner', 'mainly', 'Zodiac', 'stopped', 'killing', 'perhaps', 'only', 'stopped', 'boasting', 'press', 'police', 'Graysmith', 'can', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'investigate', 'own', 'who', 'done', 'suppositions', 'are', 'Graysmith', 'movie', 'perspective', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'pretend', 'come', 'conclusions', 'However', 'counter', 'tagline', 'should', 'view', 'Graysmith', 'obsession', 'bad', 'thing', 'Zodiac', 'walk', 'thin', 'line', 'have', 'ways', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'take', 'Greysmith', 'views', 'own.At', 'first', 'was', 'thinking', 'Zodiac', 'was', 'comparable', 'President', 'Men', 'focus', 'police', 'procedure', 'investigative', 'journalism', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'get', 'resolution', 'terms', 'teletype', 'end', 'scrawl', 'Then', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'ways', 'Zodiac', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'American', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'not', 'terms', 'viciousness', 'murder', 'rather', 'case', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'solved', 'so', 'speculation', 'murderer', 'identity', 'have', 'get', 'run', 'rampant', 'cases', 'have', 'website', 'where', 'can', 'debate', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'victims', 'see', 'messages', 'killers', 'sent', 'torment', 'police', 'also', 'sense', 'Zodiac', 'attempting', 'answer', 'unanswerable', 'question', 'much', 'From', 'Hell', 'much', 'more', 'terms', 'concrete', 'support', 'least', 'absent', 'evidence', 'contrary', '.The', 'performances', 'three', 'principle', 'performers', 'lot', 'faults', 'here', 'Downey', 'one', 'most', 'mesmerizing', 'actors', 'today', 'hard', 'keep', 'eye', 'anyone', 'else', 'when', 'screen', 'Ruffalo', 'effectively', 'restrained', 'performance', 'providing', 'lot', 'subtle', 'shadings', 'limited', 'range', 'hit', 'role', 'Gyllenhaal', 'one', 'character', 'greatest', 'arc', 'start', 'finish', 'obsession', 'finding', 'identity', 'Zodiac', 'life', 'as', 'much', 'finding', 'killer', 'somebody', 'be', 'Toschi', 'Avery', 'wife', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'tell', 'right', 'maybe', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'finally', 'getting', 'look', 'eyes', 'Zodiac', 'himself.Next', 'year', 'director', 'cut', 'Zodiac', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'suppose', 'will', 'check', 'out', 'am', 'inclined', 'doubt', 'adding', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'better', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'expand', 'various', 'elements', 'not', 'add', 'additional', 'ones', 'was', 'never', 'sufficient', 'proof', 'warrant', 'arrest', 'Graysmith', 'prime', 'suspect', 'film', 'suggestion', 'fate', 'allowed', 'time', 'run', 'out', 'speaks', 'back', 'intrinsic', 'need', 'narrative', 'completeness', 'more', 'hard', 'facts', 'movie', 'points', 'character', 'Toschi', 'sticking', 'need', 'proof', 'will', 'stand', 'up', 'court', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'Graysmith', 'amasses', 'end', 'film', 'Still', 'version', 'Zodiac', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'be', 'unsatisfying', 'various', 'levels', 'true', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'not', 'allow', 'otherwise']",N/A

The strange thing for me is that I remembered this as being an older film, like 2000 or so.  Made last year, David Fincher directed this and was nominated for Best Director from Film Critics in Chicago and Toronto.  Fincher's other films include ""Panic Room,"" ""Fight Club"" & ""Seven.""  One might expect a bloody thriller, but instead ""Zodiac"" is an intense drama centered on Robert Graysmith's compulsion to find the killer.Jake Gyllenhall who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor forBrokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)and actually won @ the British Academy Awards plays the role with subtle but growing indications of Graysmith's strength of conviction.  Since Graysmith is a cartoonist at the San Francisco paper, his mission about this case seems to come from left field.Mark Ruffalo won a Best Actor Award from the Montreal World Film Festival for ""You Can Count On Me"" and shined in one of my favorite films,Just Like Heaven (Widescreen Edition).  As Inspector David Toschi, he does a good job of bird-dogging the case, but then even he reaches a point where he wants to throw in the towel.Robert Downey Jr. plays San Francisco reporter Paul Avery whose arrogance leads him into pursuit.  Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for ""Chaplin"" and won a Golden Globe for ""Ally McBeal"" in 2000.  He shows the deterioration of the character into an alcoholic haze.Brian Cox does an excellent job as Melvin Belli.  Anthony Edwards from TV's ""ER"" plays Inspector William Armstrong who comes to prefer a desk job.  The film is a good psychological study of the main characters tracking the killer.

There are a couple of scenes in which people are killed, but by no means is that the focus of this film. It's a film about the hunt for the truth--who WAS the Zodiac killer? Did he bamboozle the press, the public, and the police so much that nobody ever knew who he really was? Or was there just so much ignorance about smart police procedure and about analytical method (a la Sherlock Holmes) that it was basically impossible to figure out his real identity?The film pulls no punches--hence it is punchy--in examining how threads are never tied up and how loose ends are never raveled into a cohesive whole. Do key people drink so much that they can't do the jobs they are supposed to do in order to pinpoint exactly who the Zodiac really was?The lead actors, as well as the supporting cast, all turn in compelling performances, but it's not hard to tell that the characters exist to drive the plot. This is not a character-driven film as much as it is a film focused on a whole bunch of people looking in a lot of different directions for roads and clues that lead to a lot of different ends--dead or otherwise.Definitely worth seeing and a really interesting departure for the director David Fincher, who previously helmed both Fight Club and Seven.",4,Smart and punchy,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,1503,"['was', 'interesting', 'see', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'young', 'dumb', 'couple', 'sitting', 'next', 'got', 'up', 'left', 'one-third', 'way', 'was', 'obvious', 'were', 'really', 'expecting', 'see', 'blood', 'gore.This', 'NOT', 'blood', 'gore', 'film', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'means', 'focus', 'film', 'film', 'hunt', 'truth', 'who', 'WAS', 'Zodiac', 'killer', 'Did', 'bamboozle', 'press', 'public', 'police', 'so', 'much', 'nobody', 'ever', 'knew', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'was', 'there', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'ignorance', 'smart', 'police', 'procedure', 'analytical', 'method', 'la', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'was', 'basically', 'impossible', 'figure', 'out', 'real', 'identity', 'film', 'punches', 'hence', 'punchy', 'examining', 'how', 'threads', 'are', 'never', 'tied', 'up', 'how', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'never', 'raveled', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'Do', 'key', 'people', 'drink', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'jobs', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'order', 'pinpoint', 'exactly', 'who', 'Zodiac', 'really', 'was', 'lead', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'turn', 'compelling', 'performances', 'not', 'hard', 'tell', 'characters', 'exist', 'drive', 'plot', 'not', 'character-driven', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'focused', 'whole', 'bunch', 'people', 'looking', 'lot', 'different', 'directions', 'roads', 'clues', 'lead', 'lot', 'different', 'ends', 'dead', 'otherwise.Definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'really', 'interesting', 'departure', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'who', 'previously', 'helmed', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Seven']",N/A

The director is Fincher and he creates a thick web of character-driven plot lines.The beginning scene shows the first murders and the victim's pain and fear.  Each scene holds your attention as the movie examines one man's obsession with finding the truth and one man's need to kill.In 1968, the San Francisco Chronile receives a letter with the Zodiac's ciphers.  A cartoonist by the name of Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), loves puzzles and as a former Boy Scout, he tries to decode the messages.  Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a reporter that wants to advance in his career and looks at this as an opportunity to do so.  As this is going on, several investigators from four jurisdictions ardently look for the elusive Killer.  Dave Toschi (Mark Fuffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) clash with news reporters, including Avery and Graysmith.  Graysmith keeps an interest in this case, and also writes a book about it.  The movie follows the investigation from 1968 - 1984 - a long, suspenseful search by Graysmith even after others have retired, given up, or just want to spend more time with their families.

It seems the Zodiac evidence was planted on Allen,through the years.Arthur Allen's father was a ranking navy man,who may have discharged the real 'Zodiac',during WW2.And the real Zodiac then plotted revenge by framing the killings on the son,Arthur Allen.It seems that Anton LaVey had entered the office of Paul Avery at one point,during the height of the Zodiac events.Avery stated that LaVey had just removed a new Church of Satan member for being 'too devout'.Avery never released the name of this individual.If LaVey had stated it was Arthur Leigh Allen,then one can only assume Lavey was a conspirator and perhaps thee ringleader in the Zodiac crimes.In any event,whoever was the modern mythical Zodiac,this DVD can only be an enchanting sourse of everlasting debate and discussion.I subtracted one star for the film being based on the now discredited Zodiac book,by Robert Graysmith.Graysmith has not retracted his old shaky claims against Arthur Allen,despite the modern forensic proof to the otherwise.And i deleted another star for no documentaries added to this first DVD version.",3,"Excellent Thriller ,yet based on a Faulty Crime Novel now discredited.",1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,1928,"['enjoy', 'crime', 'mystery', 'films', 'will', 'enyoy', 'film', 'too.Back', '1986', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'published', 'best-seller', 'sources', 'were', 'loose', 'findings', 'were', 'disjointed.Yet', 'presented', 'interesting', 'story', 'Zodiac', 'mystery.Evidence', 'gathered', 'Vallejo', 'police', 'FBI', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'bring', 'conviction', 'Arthur', 'Leigh', 'Allen.The', 'evidence', 'collected', '1970s', 'seemed', 'link', 'suggest', 'Allen', 'was', 'only', 'prime', 'candidate.By', '2002', 'advances', 'DNA', 'forensic', 'science', 'had', 'rejected', 'belief', 'Arthur', 'Allen', 'was', 'Zodiac', 'killer.All', 'associates', 'Allen', 'claimed', 'masterminded', 'Zodiac', 'caper', 'alone.If', 'Allen', 'was', 'lone', 'nut', 'mastermind', 'then', 'how', 'did', 'enlist', 'support', 'others', 'Allen', 'had', 'blueberry', 'syrup', 'stains', 'sweatshirt', 'how', 'could', 'then', 'so', 'neatly', 'arrainge', 'Zodiac', 'crimes', 'Zodiac', 'evidence', 'was', 'planted', 'Allen', 'years.Arthur', 'Allen', 'father', 'was', 'ranking', 'navy', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'discharged', 'real', ""'Zodiac"", 'WW2.And', 'real', 'Zodiac', 'then', 'plotted', 'revenge', 'framing', 'killings', 'son', 'Arthur', 'Allen.It', 'Anton', 'LaVey', 'had', 'entered', 'office', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'one', 'point', 'height', 'Zodiac', 'events.Avery', 'stated', 'LaVey', 'had', 'just', 'removed', 'new', 'Church', 'Satan', 'member', 'being', ""'too"", ""devout'.Avery"", 'never', 'released', 'name', 'individual.If', 'LaVey', 'had', 'stated', 'was', 'Arthur', 'Leigh', 'Allen', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'Lavey', 'was', 'conspirator', 'perhaps', 'thee', 'ringleader', 'Zodiac', 'crimes.In', 'event', 'was', 'modern', 'mythical', 'Zodiac', 'DVD', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'enchanting', 'sourse', 'everlasting', 'debate', 'discussion.I', 'subtracted', 'one', 'star', 'film', 'being', 'based', 'now', 'discredited', 'Zodiac', 'book', 'Robert', 'Graysmith.Graysmith', 'not', 'retracted', 'old', 'shaky', 'claims', 'Arthur', 'Allen', 'modern', 'forensic', 'proof', 'otherwise.And', 'i', 'deleted', 'star', 'documentaries', 'added', 'first', 'DVD', 'version']",N/A

As a huge fan of the serial killer movie genre, I was quite shocked that they got Jake Gyllenhaal to play the lead here (he was great in ""Donnie Darko"" but that's the only time I really found his acting believable), but consider that the ensemble piece has Robert Downey Jr and Chloe Sevigny. This is a masterpiece of movie-making, and yes, it IS three hours long, so do be advised before getting engrossed in it.""Zodiac"" is in many ways better than the film it is often compared to - ""Se7en"". That Brad Pitt film had everything going for it, but it was still far too mainstream and commercial for my liking. ""Zodiac"" corrects that. This is like watching an independent film unfold - slow, languid pacing often builds up to rushes and intelligent plot developments. Real Life events and situations are narrated with precision and clarity. This was especially difficult to do, I am sure, since the entire Zodiac case was too complicated and convoluted in real life, there was no way they could fit all of it into a three hour film and still make sense of it. Still, they achieve the impossible here.Words cannot describe the amazing direction of this film. The actual serial killer scenes are perhaps the most affecting - I can only imagine the amount of research that went into it. Then there are the scenes where the cartoonist (Gyllenhaal) begins to decipher the codes, leading him to a lifetime obsession with the case. The timeline of the film begins in the 1960s and reaches way into the 1980s.Dear Reader, do not be dissuaded by the running time, or the middle of the road reviews here. I call this movie what it is : a masterpiece. In fact, the day I watched it, I was under a cloud of fever, really sick and hacking away, but I went to the movie anyway. When it finished, my symptoms had vanished and I had never felt better. In fact, my interest in all things Zodiac were rekindled and I could perceive things with far more clarity than before. For fans of the crime genre, this particular killer has been of huge interest to us for years, and to watch his story brought to the screen with such love and devotion to the craft of film-making is a welcome gift indeed.Lastly, a word about Jake Gyllenhaal. This is not the most striking man around, nor the best actor, but its his everyday normality that makes him the perfect fit for the role here. Of special note is Downey Jr's amazing performance - this man needs to be nominated for an Oscar. And what about Chloe Sevigny? This woman is luminous in almost anything, and her act as the bookish nerdy housewife here should win her major accolades. In fact, if this is shut out at Awards season it would be a travesty.

But ""Zodiac,"" the story of the Northern California serial killer, who was more aware of his reputation and celebrity than any Hollywood starlet, gives us a subtler, more rational Fincher than his previous films would suggest. There is very little of the trademark Fincher violence and brutality here and more of a psychologically astute and emotionally cognizant one.""Zodiac"" is a story of Men working together for a common goal: that of capturing the Zodiac killer. There is the Police primarily consisting of San Francisco PD Homicide, David Toschi (a remarkably committed and persuasive Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (stalwart and dedicated Anthony Edwards) and the San Francisco Chronicle reporters Paul Avery (intelligent, pathetically alcoholic Robert Downey) and Robert Graysmith, who would go on to write the book about the Zodiac murders portrayed by the excellent and wounded, ultimately crazed-by-the-case, Jake Gyllenhaal.As a rule, in most movies of late dealing with serial killers, the serial killer is merely a jumping off point for brutal and disgusting slash and dash murders. But here Fincher has stepped back, adjusted his sights and telescoped on the psychological and emotional effects of the killings, the endless procedural details of the investigation (handwriting experts, the ""2500"" suspects), the letters sent to the SF Chronicle by Zodiac and the detritus of a 20+ year investigation that wears down and whittles away at any kind of normal life for Toshi and Graysmith.  As such ""Zodiac"" is more about the furtive, brutal legacy of the Zodiac murders and its effect on these two men than it is about the Zodiac killer himself.Gyllenhaal plays Graysmith as a man possessed: alternately repulsed by the Zodiac as a mass murderer but at the same time fascinated by his facility with the obscure language of codes, symbols and puzzles and his seemingly insatiable, preening desire for celebrity. Matching his intensity is Ruffalo's Toschi. Ruffalo has never been more persuasive and effective even bettering his feral performance in ""In the Cut."" Both men are obsessed with Zodiac and both pay for this obsession with the hard currency of years and loves lost and never regained.""Zodiac"" goes on a bit too long but its ultimate success can be attributed to its brilliant, careful and intricate accumulation and dissemination of case detail that forms the backbone of this tragic, interesting and intelligent film. The larger tragedy that this film inadvertently points out though is that Zodiac's murderous swath across California in the mid 20th. Century now seems oddly remote, old-fashioned and even quaint in this time of 9/11 and international terrorism.",5,Symbols,1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,2928,"['David', 'Fincher', 'director', 'fascinating', 'impeccably', 'composed', 'cerebral', 'Zodiac', 'not', 'heretofore', 'been', 'known', 'subtlety', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Alien3', 'Seven', 'are', 'filled', 'Life', 'doomed', 'even', 'ugly', 'sense', 'reality', 'Zodiac', 'story', 'Northern', 'California', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'aware', 'reputation', 'celebrity', 'Hollywood', 'starlet', 'subtler', 'more', 'rational', 'Fincher', 'previous', 'films', 'would', 'suggest', 'very', 'little', 'trademark', 'Fincher', 'violence', 'brutality', 'here', 'more', 'psychologically', 'astute', 'emotionally', 'cognizant', 'one', 'Zodiac', 'story', 'Men', 'working', 'together', 'common', 'goal', 'capturing', 'Zodiac', 'killer', 'Police', 'primarily', 'consisting', 'San', 'Francisco', 'PD', 'Homicide', 'David', 'Toschi', 'remarkably', 'committed', 'persuasive', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'William', 'Armstrong', 'stalwart', 'dedicated', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'reporters', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'intelligent', 'pathetically', 'alcoholic', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'write', 'book', 'Zodiac', 'murders', 'portrayed', 'excellent', 'wounded', 'ultimately', 'crazed-by-the-case', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal.As', 'rule', 'most', 'movies', 'late', 'dealing', 'serial', 'killers', 'serial', 'killer', 'merely', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'brutal', 'disgusting', 'slash', 'dash', 'murders', 'here', 'Fincher', 'stepped', 'back', 'adjusted', 'sights', 'telescoped', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'effects', 'killings', 'endless', 'procedural', 'details', 'investigation', 'handwriting', 'experts', '2500', 'suspects', 'letters', 'sent', 'SF', 'Chronicle', 'Zodiac', 'detritus', '20+', 'year', 'investigation', 'down', 'away', 'kind', 'normal', 'life', 'Toshi', 'Graysmith', 'such', 'Zodiac', 'more', 'furtive', 'brutal', 'legacy', 'Zodiac', 'murders', 'effect', 'two', 'men', 'Zodiac', 'killer', 'himself.Gyllenhaal', 'Graysmith', 'man', 'possessed', 'alternately', 'repulsed', 'Zodiac', 'mass', 'murderer', 'same', 'time', 'fascinated', 'facility', 'obscure', 'language', 'codes', 'symbols', 'puzzles', 'seemingly', 'insatiable', 'preening', 'desire', 'celebrity', 'Matching', 'intensity', 'Ruffalo', 'Toschi', 'Ruffalo', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'persuasive', 'effective', 'even', 'bettering', 'feral', 'performance', 'Cut', 'men', 'are', 'obsessed', 'Zodiac', 'pay', 'obsession', 'hard', 'currency', 'years', 'lost', 'never', 'regained', 'Zodiac', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'ultimate', 'success', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'brilliant', 'careful', 'intricate', 'accumulation', 'dissemination', 'case', 'detail', 'backbone', 'tragic', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'film', 'larger', 'tragedy', 'film', 'inadvertently', 'out', 'though', 'Zodiac', 'murderous', 'swath', 'California', 'mid', '20th', 'Century', 'now', 'oddly', 'remote', 'old-fashioned', 'even', 'quaint', 'time', '9/11', 'international', 'terrorism']",N/A

A month later, a letter written by the Zodiac Killer arrives at the San Francisco Chronicle.  Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) covers the story while the cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) struggles to decrypt the Zodiac's ciphers.The Zodiac Killer's murders take place throughout California, a fact that muddles the case further as the various police departments and sheriff offices struggle to work together. The investigators include San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), Vallejo detective Jack Mualanax (Elias Koteas), and Napa detective (Donal Logue).The Zodiac Killer's murders are particularly noteworthy because there was a constant discourse between the serial killer and the media.  The Zodiac Killer's threats included puzzles (his ciphers), creepy details about his murders (bloody bits of cloth), and finally threats against school buses full of children. In short, the Killer manipulates the media as deftly as Paris Hilton on a reality show.The movie skips ahead as the years go by and the case grows cold. Evidence gathering techniques are sorely outdated or questionably biased, detectives on the case move on, and everyone but Graysmith is determined to find the real killer.What's intriguing about Zodiac is how it manages to combine the fact-finding wonkiness of CSI with the thrilling suspense of Silence of the Lambs.  Fincher manages to balloon the Zodiac Killer into a pernicious boogeyman who is every potential suspect and behind every murder.  And that may literally be true: one theory is that the Zodiac Killer took credit for murders he didn't commit.  A roadside encounter between a woman with her infant child and a mysterious stranger is one of the scariest moments on film (for new parents like me, anyway).And it's all true.  In an era where Ed Gein's murders have been spun into the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the relevance and reality of Zodiac makes the movie even more frightening. Although the murders were never pinned on a particular person, Graysmith (also the author of the novel) makes a convincing case for Arthur Leigh Allen.Was it really Arthur?  We'll never know.  Zodiac isn't about wrapping up the film with an easy villain.  It's about the price of living in a media-saturated culture where, for three years, the scariest reality show took place not on our televisions but in handful of towns in northern California.",5,The Scariest Reality Show,1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,2542,"['Zodiac', 'July', '4', '1969', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'shoots', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'slaying', 'woman', 'not', 'man', 'month', 'later', 'letter', 'written', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'story', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'decrypt', 'Zodiac', 'ciphers.The', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'murders', 'take', 'place', 'California', 'fact', 'case', 'further', 'various', 'police', 'departments', 'sheriff', 'offices', 'struggle', 'work', 'together', 'investigators', 'include', 'San', 'Francisco', 'police', 'detectives', 'Dave', 'Toschi', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Bill', 'Armstrong', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Vallejo', 'detective', 'Jack', 'Mualanax', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'Napa', 'detective', 'Donal', 'Logue', '.The', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'murders', 'are', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'was', 'constant', 'discourse', 'serial', 'killer', 'media', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'threats', 'included', 'puzzles', 'ciphers', 'creepy', 'details', 'murders', 'bloody', 'bits', 'cloth', 'finally', 'threats', 'school', 'buses', 'full', 'children', 'short', 'Killer', 'media', 'as', 'deftly', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'reality', 'show.The', 'movie', 'ahead', 'years', 'go', 'case', 'cold', 'Evidence', 'gathering', 'techniques', 'are', 'sorely', 'outdated', 'questionably', 'biased', 'detectives', 'case', 'move', 'everyone', 'Graysmith', 'determined', 'find', 'real', 'killer.What', 'intriguing', 'Zodiac', 'how', 'combine', 'fact-finding', 'wonkiness', 'CSI', 'thrilling', 'suspense', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Fincher', 'balloon', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'pernicious', 'boogeyman', 'who', 'potential', 'suspect', 'murder', 'may', 'literally', 'be', 'true', 'one', 'theory', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'took', 'credit', 'murders', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'roadside', 'encounter', 'woman', 'infant', 'child', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'one', 'scariest', 'moments', 'film', 'new', 'parents', 'anyway', '.And', 'true', 'era', 'where', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'murders', 'have', 'been', 'spun', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'relevance', 'reality', 'Zodiac', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'frightening', 'murders', 'were', 'never', 'pinned', 'particular', 'person', 'Graysmith', 'also', 'author', 'novel', 'convincing', 'case', 'Arthur', 'Leigh', 'Allen.Was', 'really', 'Arthur', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'Zodiac', ""n't"", 'about', 'wrapping', 'up', 'film', 'easy', 'villain', 'price', 'living', 'media-saturated', 'culture', 'where', 'three', 'years', 'scariest', 'reality', 'show', 'took', 'place', 'not', 'televisions', 'handful', 'towns', 'northern', 'California']",N/A

The story comes mostly from the book by Robert Graysmith (nicely played here as an obsessed nerd by Jake Gyllenhaal). Mark Ruffalo plays the lead cop on the case, whose career is shaken in the process, and Robert Downey, Jr., plays Paul Avery, the San Francisco Chronicle crime reporter whom the case helps turn into an alcoholic. The story pulls the viewer in, winding you up in its web of facts and interpretations and hesitancies.

To have all that info and put it all together in a way to not just keep the viewers attention but have us become mildly obsessed ourselves for the 2 hour and 37 minute run time that for me flew by.At first I analyzed Zodiac a bit, when Robert Downey Jr.'s character Paul Avery let's Jake Gyllenhall's Robert Graysmith in on the fact that maybe the Zodiac wasn't responsible for all killings being linked to him, and he said to Robert you look disappointed.  I thought to myself here is a lonely divorced guy bored with his job and a serial killer is filling some sort of void and for him he sees adventure.  I abandoned that though, definitely all the crazies pretending to be the Zodiac obviously are desperate troubled people but I don't think Robert Graysmith.  In my opinion this bored divorce e saw this as a way to do something in his life, something important and make a difference, the light bulb went off for Graysmith when he again visits Downey Jr's character, which i felt was a less trippy version of Johnny Depp's character in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and he say's to him what have you done?The movie has great suspense and the killings are not bloody but done in an eerie effective way.

1076841,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000QUCNOU,mirasreviews,"[5, 8]","Director David Fincher fuses his signature gloom with docudrama in ""Zodiac"", which follows the interminable case of the Zodiac killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in 1969 and taunted police by reporting his own crimes and insisting that his messages be published in newspapers. The film is based on the books ""Zodiac"" and ""Zodiac Unmasked"" by Robert Graysmith, who was an editorial cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle when it was the Zodiac killer's favorite publicity generator and who went on to investigate the case himself, tracking down more evidence years after the case had been abandoned by police. The filmmakers did some investigating themselves, and audiences will wonder why some leads were not pursued -which only heighten the mystery and augment the notoriety of the Zodiac case.On July, 4 1969, a Vallejo, California couple are shot in their parked car. Four weeks later, someone calling himself ""The Zodiac"" takes credit for the murder and insists that the San Francisco Chronicle and 2 other newspapers publish a cipher of his creation. More apparently motive-less murders follow. When a San Francisco cab driver is shot, SFPD detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) find themselves on the Zodiac case. Meanwhile, Chronicle editorial writer Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) have taken an interest as well. Difficulties co-coordinating police jurisdictions, overlooked clues, and a cheeky killer hamper the investigation, but a paucity of forensic evidence may prove insurmountable.""Zodiac"" is over 2  hours long and lacks a traditional conflict-climax-resolution plot structure. It plods on at a languorous, almost dreamy pace, just as the Zodiac investigation proceeded, in fits and starts, for 3 decades. The film follows the case from 1969 to 1991, spending most of its time in the 1970s when evidence was still being uncovered. This is essentially a procedural, reminiscent of post-War docudramas, that takes us step-by-step through the investigation with the aid of many date stamps -which are necessary to achieve coherence given the time lapses and duration of the Zodiac case. ""Zodiac"" departs from docudrama tradition, however, in its frustrated, often clueless protagonists and in its conclusion. David Fincher's presentation is thoughtful and provocative but requires patience. This was reflected in dismal box office receipts, but ""Zodiac"" is better suited to home viewing.The DVD (Paramount 2007): There are no bonus features on this DVD, but a Director's Cut with an audio commentary, interviews with investigators, detailed analysis of the crimes, behind-the-scenes features, and more will be released in 2008.

1076845,A3EULZNXT15RWX,B000QUCNOU,M. Olic,"[4, 9]","Zodiac (Two-Disc Director's Cut) [HD DVD]This review refers to HD-DVD 2-disc edition set. Movie is sort of documentary type trying to accurately portray Zodiac killings from late '60s. It is pretty long at 2:42 minutes and somewhat boring. Killings occur within first hour while speculation and bogus theories continue until the end. Movie is based on the book Zodiac written by Robert Graysmith, cartoonist who worked at the time of killings at SF Chronicle newspaper. His findings about Zodiac are completely bogus pointing into wrong direction. After his book was published, police compared handwriting, DNA sample and fingerprints with Graysmith's main suspect Arthur Leigh Allen and conclusively find that he wasn't Zodiac.Regardless of Graysmith's hallucinations, Fincher's movie is really good. Excellent directing not leaving a single detail untouched with gorgeous HD picture and very nice special effects that brought 70's back to the screen in fullest are worth watching. Thanks to being based on poorly written book I wouldn't give this movie more than 3 stars but the second disc with 3 and a half hours of extras including interviews with two survivors of Zodiac killings and other real life participants make this set superb recap of Zodiac killings worth watching for everyone interested in serial killers. That is why I gave 5 stars to this movie.What people more want to know is who really Zodiac was. There hasn't been offered a single valid theory that would explain his killings and the man behind them. Only four killings were officially assigned as Zodiac's while the rest are unconfirmed.1. David Arthur Faraday, 17, and Betty Lou Jensen, 16: Shot and killed on December 20, 1968, on Lake Herman Road just within the city limits of Benicia.2. Michael Renault Mageau, 19, and Darlene Elizabeth Ferrin, 22: Shot on July 4, 1969, at the Blue Rock Springs Golf Course parking lot on the outskirts of Vallejo; Darlene was DOA at Kaiser Foundation Hospital, while Michael survived.3. Bryan Calvin Hartnell, 20, and Cecelia Ann Shepard, 22: Stabbed on September 27, 1969 at Lake Berryessa in Napa County. Hartnell survived six stab wounds to the back, but Shepard died of her injuries two days later.4. Paul Lee Stine, 29: Shot and killed on October 11, 1969, in Presidio Heights in San Francisco.The key of finding Zodiac is the fourth killing where pattern of killing love couples in rural areas around San Francisco has been broken. I made some research and find out that fourth killing occurred exactly one year after shooting and killing of Michael Bunch, 19-year-old anti-war serviceman while trying to escape Presidio military base. He was confined for being AWOL and imprisoned together with other anti-war servicemen. It is strange that no one noticed this detail. Who is the killer and why?Killer called himself Zodiac which is a circular or elliptical diagram representing this belt, and usually containing pictures of the animals, human figures, etc., that are associated with the constellations and signs. Duration of one cycle is one year and if you check out his killings you will see that all of them happened between October 11th, 1968 and October 11th, 1969. Motive is most obviously revenge for Bunch's killing and culprit according to Zodiac is society itself. He is most likely left-wing anti-war radical who wanted to change society by killings and terror. From details released by the police he was a GI probably working at Presidio or other military base. The best search for him would be to question all anti-war GIs stationed in San Francisco at that time, particularly group known as Nine4Peace that used to protest by chaining themselves to priests in churches in San Francisco Area in July of 1968.Sign used by Zodiac is actually Celtic cross which might explain why he used it if we know that GIs protested at churches. It has nothing to do with Zodiac brand of watches and represents sun cross. Zodiac was clearly inspired by religion and mythology in his first deciphered letter when he mentioned his victims becoming his slaves to serve him in paradise. The most difficult part is how did he choose his killing dates? These dates actually reveal true message of Zodiac while cyphered letters were just a decoy.Zodiac message is Nine4Justice Presidio. First killings were under Sagittarius which is ninth sign of Zodiac, second one were under Cancer which is fourth sign of Zodiac, third one were under Libra which is number seven but stands for justice and final killing was on the anniversary of killing of Michael Bunch. It happened on Presidio Heights and then after killing he went straight to Presidio military base.If you examine mythology of these astral signs you can find out that Sagittarius is associated with Satyr who represents sex drive. That's why he killed love couples in the first place. Cancer is associated with hydra which represents corrupt society that needs to be cut and sealed by fire to prevent it from further corruption. That's why he kills not talk or try to convince others in his ideas. Libra as already mentioned represents justice. Some also wondered about why Zodiac uses two stamps. All numbers divided by 2 are called even. Since he is done all those killings as a revenge to get EVEN for killing of Michael Bunch then it makes perfect sense to use two stamps to point this out.I intentionally wrote this review on 40th anniversary of killing of Michael Bunch that started Zodiac killings. I sincerely hope that he will be caught or if dead, his identity revealed to bring back some peace to the victims of his gruesome killings.",5,Zodiac Revealed,1223683200,"10 11,

One little bit of anachronism can ruin the whole movie for me. Fortunately that did not happen with Zodiac. With the disk of extras it soon becomes apparent that the best special effects are those you don't notice. Like magic the San Francisco cityscape evolves from the mid and late 60s through the 70s and later. And some of the more grisly scenes are done with state of the art CG as well.The movie is about the Zodiac killings in the San Francisco Bay area that gained national recognition in the summer of 1969. But the case took a back seat to the Sharon Tate killings by the Manson Family in LA, the first moon landing, Woodstock, the Vietnam War, and so on.I remember hearing about it at the time (I was 17 or so) but it faded from public notice nationally due to the inability of law enforcement to find the killer. It was, however, front page news in Northern California for a long time.This movie is a documentary of sorts, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Get this Blu Ray!

Doyle ""film buff""","[1, 1]","ZODIAC starts off with a bang, and then gets so bogged down in intense detective work that the thriller aspect is diluted by the time the first hour is over. Furthermore, since the case was never really solved, there's no real payoff at the end--just more speculation.Despite this, it manages to hold the attention for well over two hours with a tale that zig-zags back and forth between a newspaper (The San Francisco Chronicle), its crime reporter (ROBERT DOWNEY, JR.) and cartoonist (JAKE GYLLENHAAL), and the police force with MARK RUFFALO as the lead detective on the case and his partner (ANTHONY EDWARDS) both committed to finding the Zodiac killer.The clever murderer keeps the police at bay over a period of years and still they try to uncover each clue and spend a great deal of time working on the unsolved murders that eventually claim some thirteen lives. The first murders are staged brilliantly by director David Fincher, and the film becomes a gripping search for the sadistic killer. But after the murder of a taxicab driver, the film veers into detective work with a penchant for detail that soon becomes bogged down in too much exposition.JAKE GYLLENHAAL is excellent as the boyishly enthusiastic cartoonist who soon becomes obsessed by the case. He's the one who eventually wrote two books on the subject. His scariest moment comes toward the end of the film when he's invited to the home of an acquaintance of the killer hoping to glean some important information. His fear and horror that the man might be the killer himself almost makes up for the fact that the story has no real solution. It's a brilliantly staged scene with his panic attack never overplayed.The other performances are uniformly good, but it's Gyllenhaal who does the most convincing job in the central role. Sad to see DERMOT MULRONEY wasted in the small role of a police captain.Summing up: Suspenseful and well directed, but loses some momentum when it shifts from the horrific murders to the relentless detective work.",4,Suspenseful thriller based on true unsolved case...excellent performances...,1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,2014,"['ZODIAC', 'bang', 'then', 'so', 'bogged', 'down', 'intense', 'detective', 'work', 'thriller', 'aspect', 'diluted', 'time', 'first', 'hour', 'Furthermore', 'case', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'solved', 'real', 'payoff', 'end', 'just', 'more', 'speculation.Despite', 'hold', 'attention', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'tale', 'zig-zags', 'back', 'forth', 'newspaper', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'crime', 'reporter', 'ROBERT', 'DOWNEY', 'JR.', 'cartoonist', 'JAKE', 'GYLLENHAAL', 'police', 'force', 'MARK', 'RUFFALO', 'lead', 'detective', 'case', 'partner', 'ANTHONY', 'EDWARDS', 'committed', 'finding', 'Zodiac', 'killer.The', 'clever', 'murderer', 'police', 'bay', 'period', 'years', 'still', 'try', 'uncover', 'clue', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'working', 'unsolved', 'murders', 'eventually', 'claim', 'thirteen', 'lives', 'first', 'murders', 'are', 'staged', 'brilliantly', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'film', 'gripping', 'search', 'sadistic', 'killer', 'murder', 'taxicab', 'driver', 'film', 'veers', 'detective', 'work', 'penchant', 'detail', 'soon', 'bogged', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'exposition.JAKE', 'GYLLENHAAL', 'excellent', 'boyishly', 'enthusiastic', 'cartoonist', 'who', 'soon', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'case', 'one', 'who', 'eventually', 'wrote', 'two', 'books', 'subject', 'scariest', 'moment', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'invited', 'home', 'acquaintance', 'killer', 'hoping', 'glean', 'important', 'information', 'fear', 'horror', 'man', 'might', 'be', 'killer', 'almost', 'up', 'fact', 'story', 'real', 'solution', 'brilliantly', 'staged', 'scene', 'panic', 'attack', 'never', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'good', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'most', 'convincing', 'job', 'central', 'role', 'Sad', 'see', 'DERMOT', 'MULRONEY', 'wasted', 'small', 'role', 'police', 'captain.Summing', 'up', 'Suspenseful', 'well', 'directed', 'momentum', 'when', 'horrific', 'murders', 'relentless', 'detective', 'work']",N/A

Fincher's first since taking a long break after Panic Room, Zodiac revolves around a trio of characters who all do their own work as the Zodiac killer both terrorizes and puzzles them.  The first department that Zodiac succeeds in is with the casting, which includes Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith (the cartoonist who wrote the book the film is derived from), the great Robert Downey Jr. as crime writer Paul Avery, and Mark Ruffalo as cop David Toschi; all of whom find themselves brought together as the body count rises.  The rest of the cast features Chloe Sevigny, Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, Donal Logue, and Dermot Mulroney; all of whom in smaller but nevertheless pivotal roles that could have been wasted by any other actors.  Fincher himself is in fine form as his look of the film is grimy and reflective of the era without being dated, and the cinematography and art direction are simply brilliant.  The only real flaw with Zodiac is that the film is overlong and has no real ending (then again, anyone familiar with the crimes should take this as no surprise), but in every other department, Zodiac is a winner.

Seven months later, the San Francisco Chronicle receives a letter in which the writer claims he is Darlene's killer and intends to kill again. This letter would not only terrify the public, but would start an obsession for four men. This obsession would ruin marriages and careers. For the next two decades, these four men were fixated on one question, one that would never be completely answered, a question that may, within itself, be just as dangerous as finding the answer: Who is the Zodiac?Zodiac is a superb film that is as realistic and authentic as a film based on actual events film can be. It is filled with characters who can only be inspired by actual people. The film boasts an excellent cast, with every actor contributing scintillating performances. Robert Downey, Jr., is charismatic and quirky as Paul Avery, bringing this character to life, as the audience witnesses his descent from a funny and brilliant ace reporter to a practically unemployable alcoholic. Anthony Edwards is pensive and understated as the cop who cannot handle the pressure of an unsolved case. Mark Ruffalo's Detective Dave Toschi is a determined and streetwise cop whose frustration almost consumes him, as each lead produces insufficient evidence to charge a suspect. Finally, Jake Gyllenhaal's Robert Graysmith is funny and heartwarming as the cartoonist-turned-amateur-sleuth, who comes the closest to solving the crime.The director, David Fincher, is masterful at bringing the dark and macabre to the screen and he does not disappoint with Zodiac. The attacks are not as dark or elaborate as those seen in his previous film, Se7en, yet the director still manages to portray each murder as cold, callous, and shocking. The story is brilliantly told in chronological order, starting with the first victims. We see what starts off as a routine murder investigation grow out of control, as two detectives and two reporters become consumed by the hunt for the Zodiac murderer. These four stories are presented in a way that seems believable and genuine. Their obsession seems to leap off the screen and touch its audience. As the film progresses, the viewer also becomes obsessed with the pursuit of the killer. However, this pursuit is not going to end with Harry Callahan shooting the killer dead. There is no neat Hollywood ending to this film; it will not answer all of your questions. In fact, you will find yourself asking that same question - Who is the Zodiac?The DVD extras contain the usual mix of trailers, but it also contains a ""featurette"" on the making of the movie. Fincher fans will love this. If you are not convinced that Fincher strived to create a film that was both authentic and unbiased, you will be after watching this insight into his process.

1076858,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000QUCNOU,OverTheMoon,"[3, 3]","Zodiac could well be the best film of 2007. As far as movies about serial killers go, David Fincher might find that with this and Se7en, he has earned both second and third place, paying homage to his master, Hitchcock, who retains first place with his cross-dressing shower murderer.Avid enthusiasts of the Zodiac case will find this movie faithful in many departments and it does try to reveal the executioner which is impressive for a serial killer movie about a slaughterer that was never caught... well at least officially. Fincher implicates one of the possible suspects beyond a doubt so we do find closure.However, Zodiac is more than just a serial killer movie. It is about obsession and how it destroys lives. The film leaves you wondering, who is more obsessed and deluded? The serial killer who stalks victims for media fame, or the cartoonist turned wannabe detective who abandons his family and fills his rooms with boxes of files instead of his kids. In a memorable scene which describes the vast time periods involved (the film spans over 20 years) his kids know the ins and outs of the case better than some detectives do.This is well made, well acted film that also looks great. Fincher is never shy to the make the most of his cinematography. Even the overhead car tracking shots reveal that Fincher has still got tricks up his sleeve. The lighting, like in Se7en, is impeccable. Zodiac has some of highest production values that you can find in any contemporary classic.Overall the Zodiac is a must see for the high pace suspense. So much goes on in so little time you should feel the urge to watch it again. When films do that, they give you a reason to own it. Fincher makes films that people with brains want to see.In an era gone by when teen lovers are either slashed by dream demons with razor fingers or bludgeoned by a guy in a hockey mask (insert clown mask also), there is nothing more terrifying than the thought of a guy who breathes heavy on the end of the phone or calls in to a chat show to discuss his little problem of knifing up women while denying that his over-the-air shrieks from beyond this dimension are anything other than just his headache.",5,"""When I do it the headaches stop...""",1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,2186,"['Zodiac', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'film', '2007', 'As', 'far', 'movies', 'serial', 'killers', 'go', 'David', 'Fincher', 'might', 'find', 'Se7en', 'earned', 'second', 'third', 'place', 'paying', 'homage', 'master', 'Hitchcock', 'who', 'first', 'place', 'cross-dressing', 'shower', 'murderer.Avid', 'enthusiasts', 'Zodiac', 'case', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'faithful', 'many', 'departments', 'try', 'reveal', 'executioner', 'impressive', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'slaughterer', 'was', 'never', 'caught', 'well', 'least', 'officially', 'one', 'possible', 'doubt', 'do', 'find', 'closure.However', 'Zodiac', 'more', 'just', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'obsession', 'how', 'lives', 'film', 'wondering', 'who', 'more', 'obsessed', 'deluded', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'victims', 'media', 'fame', 'cartoonist', 'turned', 'wannabe', 'detective', 'who', 'family', 'rooms', 'boxes', 'files', 'instead', 'kids', 'memorable', 'scene', 'vast', 'time', 'periods', 'involved', 'film', '20', 'years', 'kids', 'know', 'ins', 'outs', 'case', 'better', 'detectives', 'do.This', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'Fincher', 'never', 'shy', 'make', 'most', 'cinematography', 'Even', 'overhead', 'car', 'tracking', 'shots', 'reveal', 'Fincher', 'still', 'got', 'up', 'sleeve', 'lighting', 'Se7en', 'impeccable', 'Zodiac', 'highest', 'production', 'values', 'can', 'find', 'contemporary', 'classic.Overall', 'Zodiac', 'must', 'see', 'high', 'pace', 'suspense', 'So', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'should', 'feel', 'urge', 'watch', 'again', 'When', 'films', 'do', 'give', 'reason', 'own', 'Fincher', 'films', 'people', 'brains', 'want', 'see.In', 'era', 'gone', 'when', 'teen', 'lovers', 'are', 'slashed', 'dream', 'demons', 'razor', 'fingers', 'bludgeoned', 'guy', 'hockey', 'mask', 'insert', 'clown', 'mask', 'also', 'nothing', 'more', 'terrifying', 'thought', 'guy', 'who', 'heavy', 'end', 'phone', 'chat', 'show', 'discuss', 'little', 'problem', 'knifing', 'up', 'women', 'denying', 'over-the-air', 'shrieks', 'dimension', 'are', 'anything', 'other', 'just', 'headache']",N/A

Zodiac, as many have said, feels almost like a more adult version of that film, though with the same visual flair and a sense of impreccable detail toward the case, the players and the suspects in it.  Story follows the lives of Graysmith (played excellently by Gyllenhaal), who, as a cartoonist for the S.F. Examiner, becomes obsessed with the case, leading him to a kindrid spirit in the form of an Animal Cracker eating S.F. detective played by Mark Ruffalo who shares in Graysmith's obsession in finding the real Zodiac, even years after he's slipped into footnote.  As with all stories of obsession, the characters personal and professional lives suffer to varying degrees of effectiveness.  Robert Downey Jr. who plays an addled, hot-shot journalist sees his career deadened by drugs and alcohol in the Zodiac's mythic wake.  The movie doesn't feel it's over two and a half hour running length thanks to the twists and turns in the plot and the suspects the plot proffers for the viewer's own inspection.  The film offers no answers and leaves the the killer's identity up to the viewer.  As anyone who's followed the case at any length will know, the killer was never fingered, nor brought to justice and the main and only suspect is now dead.  Smartly, the story never wallows in grusesome kills (though there are several), but rather depicts the lives of those affected by investigating the case, who, many years later, still live with those ghosts.",4,"""This is the Zodiac speaking""",1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,1704,"['Gripping', 'times', 'chilling', 'adaptation', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'novel', 'infamous', 'Zodiac', 'brutal', 'killings', 'strange', 'courtship', 'media', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'first', 'return', 'serial', 'killer', 'genre', 'great', 'Seven', 'Zodiac', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'almost', 'more', 'adult', 'version', 'film', 'same', 'visual', 'flair', 'sense', 'impreccable', 'detail', 'case', 'players', 'suspects', 'Story', 'lives', 'Graysmith', 'played', 'excellently', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'cartoonist', 'S.F', 'Examiner', 'obsessed', 'case', 'leading', 'kindrid', 'spirit', 'form', 'Animal', 'Cracker', 'eating', 'S.F', 'detective', 'played', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'shares', 'Graysmith', 'obsession', 'finding', 'real', 'Zodiac', 'even', 'years', 'slipped', 'footnote', 'stories', 'obsession', 'characters', 'personal', 'professional', 'lives', 'suffer', 'varying', 'degrees', 'effectiveness', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'addled', 'hot-shot', 'journalist', 'career', 'deadened', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'Zodiac', 'mythic', 'wake', 'movie', ""n't"", 'feel', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'running', 'length', 'thanks', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'suspects', 'plot', 'proffers', 'viewer', 'own', 'inspection', 'film', 'answers', 'killer', 'identity', 'up', 'viewer', 'anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'case', 'length', 'will', 'know', 'killer', 'was', 'never', 'fingered', 'brought', 'justice', 'main', 'only', 'suspect', 'now', 'dead', 'Smartly', 'story', 'never', 'grusesome', 'kills', 'are', 'several', 'rather', 'lives', 'affected', 'investigating', 'case', 'who', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'live', 'ghosts']",N/A

This film does an excellent job about keeping the reader guessing about who is and who isn't the killer.  It also does a great job of showing us how the police evolved into catching him and for those who've read the book this was based on we learn that the Zodiac case is what lead to many of the criminal procedures that resulted in the arrest of Ted Bundy and other serial killers.The film is well cast and well acted.  I think one point that was made in one of the reviews I have read about this film is that it catches the vibe of 1970's San Francisco without becoming a silly kitsch piece. The acting is exceptional and it is great to see Anthony Edwards back after a long time off since he left ER. The film works because it has actors large and small playing great roles. There are some tense and disturbing segments as Fichner does not wish to portray Zodiac as anything less than an evil person.One caveat I should offer is that the closing credits make it sound like the DNA did not match Arthur Leigh Allan.  That is not quite true.  The sample had degraded so much that a conclusive match, great than 95% could not be made.

1076870,A2L7WYA5OENV03,B000QUCNOU,Reticuli,"[0, 0]","Reposted: 12/01/2008Traumatic.  That's what the killings down by the lake were to watch in the theater.  Seconds before it had just sunk in: the reality of this moment.  This had happened.  These people were there together.  Their fear was real.  The man had come out of nowhere.  In the next moment they are being stabbed.  The camera does not turn away.  There are no quick edits.  We are not at a far master shot, either.  We're as close as those two lovers were to each other and we never left that space.  I am traumatized and perhaps I should be, but I wasn't ready for a mind-altering experience on the level of Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan.  And if you don't remember, those films were revolutionary for their depiction of realistic death by violence in a you-are-there manner.  It was appropriate to the subject matter for sure, that's why it wasn't exploitation or offensive in the way you would normally assume.  Zodiac, however, was not particularly gory in comparison.  Rather the humanity & reality of these victims and the sheer randomness of the encounters is what shocks.  If you are not used to this sort of thing, be prepared to be in a humor-less, mildly traumatized state for at least 24 hours after seeing this film.I had a theory about David Fincher as a director.  That theory stated that every other film of his is a masterpiece.  Seven was great.  Alien 3 sucked.  Fight Club was great.  Panic Room sucked.  Zodiac...  I can't say great, because I'm too affected by it right now.  And calling it entertaining or even art I'm not sure is appropriate.  It was not poorly done, but it's going to take some time for it to sink in.  I can't think of any reason to give it less than 5 stars, though.  Fincher has certainly taken us on a journey of frustration and terror from the vantage point of those aforementioned victims, the police, and the journalists covering it.  Since I assume that's a proper portrayal of their experiences, I think Fincher and company accomplished their goals.  The writing, acting, direction and all the technical aspects were so on the mark that I often lost my awareness of watching a movie.Now, who was the Zodiac?  If all the information portrayed in the film is correct, then it's clearly Allen.  I don't know that is the case, as I don't know much on this particular subject.  However, after just watching the film I am left with a few gut reactions.  First, Zodiac distinctly strikes me as either a law enforcement person or someone who was denied that type of employment.  It reminded me of Aldrich Ames or Robert Hanssen being disgruntled intell workers wanting to show their peers how incompetent these peers are.  I also sense a contradiction in thinking a child molester would even be targeting adults in the first place, since they often gravitate to children due to their lack of socio-sexual maturity; and even if they did why would they not rape any of the victims prior to their murder?  The whole talk about slaves sounded like a man who was always a subordinate and never allowed to lead.In that area of California, you also had a surge of New Age occult-like ""free living"" movements that a lot of traditionalists were emphasizing as fornication and a rejection of conservative values amongst young people.  It makes me wonder how someone who was a little too old to be part of these movements, who was raised very conservatively but had already concluded they themselves were a ""Lost Soul"" might respond to a sudden social movement that was embracing these non-traditional beliefs without feeling guilt or shame like he had.  Thus he is both seeking revenge on the imposters and by killing the transgressors also increasing his ranks of slaves of the Lesser Evil who will be subordinate to his Supreme Evil in the next life.  Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.  I've met a number of very religious people who oddly enough feel beyond redemption (their word, not mine) so they just become more screwed up.  It just usually doesn't include murder, but I see no reason why it might occasionally.But then I'm forced to think down another line.  Profiles of serial killers often seem to fall into two groups.  There are the extremely eccentric, fixated types like Dahmer & Bundy.  Then there are the media hungry ones.  And there are some killers who are a combination of both.  I'm reminded of the astronomy advances in planet detection.  They have found mostly planets that exhibit one or more of the following attributes: 1. They are large.  2. They are close to their host star.  3. They have fast revolutions.  Yet the Doppler spectrum shift detection methods tend to find these planets easiest because they produce the largest shifts.  As technology improves, more planets are being found that have fewer or none of these attributes.  Therefore, early conclusions by laymen that most planets were big, close to their host stars, and had faster revolutions than in our star system were incorrect.  In all likelihood it means there are a great many planets out there, with just a minority of them initially fitting these detection requirements.Applying this logic to serial killers, if the only killings we are attributing to serial killers are those that are clearly purposely similar or eccentric, and/or are the result of individuals who are looking for publicity & attention from police & the media, then concluding that the average serial killer exhibits these attributes could very well be erroneous.  A higher proportion of unsolved murders & disappearing persons could be the result of serial killers than we realize, with enough variation in methods and a lack of correspondence with police or media that they are never put into that category.  That's a truly terrible thought, but it makes sense.  Most people do not murder in their lifetime.  Yet there are murders and many of them are never even close to ever solved.  Someone is doing them.  Captured serial killers often mention the thrill of the kill.  It seems to make sense then that those murderers who do it once will likely do it again, especially if it was random to begin with.  Could there be a small subculture of silent, sufficiently pattern-less & non-fame-seeking serial killers out there lurking?  I hope not.  Maybe serial killers are prone like the rest of us to wanting attention & credit, and hopefully the killing need is more deeply tied to eccentricity & pattern.  I'd like to hope that were the case.  Anyway, at least I'm feeling a little less traumatized right now.  Probably not justifiably so, but we all need to sleep, right?",5,So Disturbing I Had To Delete This Review And Give Myself Time,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,6605,"['Reposted', '12/01/2008Traumatic',

1076871,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B000QUCNOU,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[3, 3]","""Zodiac"" takes the lives of several people associated with the notorious serial killer of the same pseudonym and, over the course of thirty years, charts their efforts and involvements with the case.The first thing I noticed when watching ""Zodiac"" is the direction: David Fichter, masterful genius behind other such thrillers as ""Se7en"", ""Fight Club"", and ""Panic Room"", weaves a beguiling sense of glossy mainstream Hollywood - there's a surreality and a sense of plastic-fantastic to the desaturated, yellowish shots and beautifully disconnected panoramas of San Francisco Bay - and then firmly and squarely yanks the rug out from under our feet with some very visceral murder scenes. His clever use of claustrophobic camerawork during interior and conversation set-pieces serves to further our connection both with Zodiac's victims and the movie's heroes, and the entire movie runs at a deliberately languid pace. It's certainly no tense slash-n'-hack thriller, but David Fichter's talent behind the camera means that ""Zodiac"" rewards us instead with a thoroughly absorbing 157 minutes.Acting-wise, there aren't any weak points: Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. and Jake Gyllenhaal, excellent to a man, receive more than ample support from Chlo Sevigny, Anthony Edwards and Brian Cox, with John Carroll Lynch giving a fantastic performance as Arthur Leigh Allen. In sum, the acting in ""Zodiac"" is more than a match for the fantastic direction. Similarly, James Vanderbilt's screenplay, from the original Robert Graysmith book, is top-drawer: as someone unfamiliar with the Zodiac murders I was kept guessing until the final frames, and that, to me, is the mark of a great thriller.All in all, ""Zodiac"" is one of the across-the-board best films I've seen in a long time.

Instead of spending a lot of time focusing on the acts of the killer, the film focuses primarily on the investigators involved in the case and one man's obsession with finding the truth.Expect more dialogue and clue-chasing rather than grisly acts of murder, although there are a few of those. Silence of the Lambs this ain't, but it's still a well-acted and well put together film with dark psychological undertones (of which Fincher has proved to be a master since ""Se7en""). The actors all give good performances, escpecially Robert Downey Jr. who seems to shine above all others.I enjoyed the film, but found that a one-time viewing was enough for me. I was really too young to remember the case, but it was interesting to learn more about one of the most famous serial murderers in U.S. history. The fact that it was a true story was a big plus. If this had been a work of fiction, I probably would not have cared for the film at all.For those of you who loved the film or if you love DVDs with extras, please wait until next year before shelling out your money for this film because a definitive director's cut will be released with oodles of extra features including modern-day interviews with surviving victims and investigators of the case.Overview: it's worth a look, but not a purchase, in my humble opinion.",3,Unexpected approach....,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,1439,"['Director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'unexpected', 'approach', 'telling', 'fact-based', 'story', 'Zodiac', 'killer', '1970s', 'Instead', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'focusing', 'acts', 'killer', 'film', 'primarily', 'investigators', 'involved', 'case', 'one', 'man', 'obsession', 'finding', 'truth.Expect', 'more', 'dialogue', 'clue-chasing', 'rather', 'grisly', 'acts', 'murder', 'are', 'few', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'ai', ""n't"", 'still', 'well-acted', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'dark', 'psychological', 'undertones', 'Fincher', 'proved', 'be', 'master', 'Se7en', 'actors', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'escpecially', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'shine', 'others.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'found', 'one-time', 'viewing', 'was', 'enough', 'was', 'really', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'case', 'was', 'interesting', 'learn', 'more', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'serial', 'murderers', 'U.S.', 'history', 'fact', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'big', 'plus', 'had', 'been', 'work', 'fiction', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'cared', 'film', 'who', 'loved', 'film', 'love', 'DVDs', 'extras', 'please', 'wait', 'next', 'year', 'shelling', 'out', 'money', 'film', 'definitive', 'director', 'cut', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'oodles', 'extra', 'features', 'including', 'modern-day', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'victims', 'investigators', 'case.Overview', 'look', 'not', 'purchase', 'humble', 'opinion']",N/A

Graysmith's agonizing reconstruction of the late 1960s and early 1970s Zodiac murders in California is astonishing in its own right, and this feature is worthy of his efforts. Though the case remains technically open in several California jurisdictions, the suspect thought most likely to have committed the murders, Arthur Leigh Allen, was never charged and died of a heart attack several years ago.The film is brilliant in its representation of the era, with all the details from types of cars to airliner paint schemes nearly perfect in every way. It is brilliantly directed by David Fincher as a dark and menacing drama. ""Zodiac"" is extraordinarily creepy and nuanced while never resorting to gore (though some of the murders are graphic), with great lighting and details: I liked the oppressive rain throughout much of the film, for instance.The acting is superb, with Jake Gyllenhaal playing the introverted Graysmith, an inspired performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as a drug and alcohol addicted reporter, Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards perfectly cast as homicide investigators, and the brilliant John Carroll Lynch (""Fargo"") as Arthur Leigh Allen.The only critique I have of the film is that at 157 minutes, it is rather long, and could have probably been trimmed by fifteen minutes quite easily.

1076881,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000QUCNOU,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","With ""Zodiac,"" director David Fincher returns to the crime thriller territory he explored to such effectiveness in ""Seven"" a dozen odd years ago.For over a decade - from December 1968 to the late 1970's - a serial killer calling himself The Zodiac terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area, dispatching his victims seemingly at random while keeping up a cryptic, cat-and-mouse correspondence with several major newspapers in the area.  Despite some impressive leads, the killer was never caught and the murders eventually stopped as quickly and mysteriously as they had started.At 160 minutes, ""Zodiac"" lacks the streamlining and telescoping we've come to expect from movies about serial killers, which are more often designed for sensationalism and exploitation than contemplation and reflection.  Taking a novelistic approach to the subject, screenwriter James Vanderbilt gives the drama room to breathe, allowing detail to pile upon detail, and providing an array of characters who disappear from the drama for long periods of time only to return to center stage when called upon to do so by the facts of the case.The drawback in such a strategy is that the movie occasionally feels aimless and formless, as it ricochets back and forth between plot strands and characters that often seem at cross purposes to one another.  But the distinct advantage of this approach is that the movie feels less contrived and artificial and more akin to real life, as it captures the sometimes decidedly unglamorous nature and frustratingly plodding pace of actual crime detection.  And for those who might be hesitant to watch the film due strictly to its subject matter, it should be noted that, for a movie on such a grisly topic, ""Zodiac"" is surprisingly tame in the blood-and-guts department (thank goodness).Indeed, the movie gets its unnerving murder scenes out of the way right up front, so it can turn its full attention to its real areas of interest:  chronicling the behind-the-scenes search for the killer and exploring the psychological impact this search has on three men who become, to varying degrees, obsessed with the case.  Jake Gyllenhaal, who hit a career high water mark in 2005 with ""Proof,"" ""Jarhead"" and, of course, ""Brokeback Mountain,"" continues his journey into edgy roles playing Graysmith, the rather nerdy cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, who managed to get closer to unveiling the true identity of the killer than anyone else, and who went on to write of his experiences in the book, ""Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer Revealed,"" on which the film itself is based.  Graysmith was able to scoop even the lead investigator, David Toschi (sharply played by the always interesting Mark Ruffalo), who finds his life becoming ever more overtaken by the case the longer it drags on without resolution.  The third major actor in the drama is Paul Avery, the crime beat reporter who turned to drink, thereby torpedoing his own career, after the killer singled him out as a potential target.  It is the lack of screen time allotted to Avery that offers one of the genuine disappointments of the movie, especially as he is embodied by the brilliant Robert Downey Jr., whose own life experiences make him the perfect choice for the role.With its meticulously mounted, pitch-perfect recreation of the details of the case as well as the times in which they took place, ""Zodiac"" is one of the few films of recent years that can truly be termed a thinking man`s thriller.",4,a thinking-man's thriller,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,3517,"['Zodiac', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'crime', 'thriller', 'territory', 'explored', 'such', 'effectiveness', 'Seven', 'dozen', 'odd', 'years', 'ago.For', 'decade', 'December', '1968', 'late', '1970', 'serial', 'killer', 'calling', 'Zodiac', 'terrorized', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'Area', 'dispatching', 'victims', 'seemingly', 'random', 'keeping', 'up', 'cryptic', 'cat-and-mouse', 'correspondence', 'several', 'major', 'newspapers', 'area', 'impressive', 'leads', 'killer', 'was', 'never', 'caught', 'murders', 'eventually', 'stopped', 'quickly', 'mysteriously', 'had', 'started.At', '160', 'minutes', 'Zodiac', 'streamlining', 'telescoping', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'movies', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'designed', 'sensationalism', 'exploitation', 'contemplation', 'reflection', 'Taking', 'novelistic', 'approach', 'subject', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'Vanderbilt', 'drama', 'room', 'breathe', 'allowing', 'detail', 'pile', 'detail', 'providing', 'array', 'characters', 'who', 'disappear', 'drama', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'only', 'return', 'center', 'stage', 'when', 'called', 'upon', 'do', 'so', 'facts', 'case.The', 'drawback', 'such', 'strategy', 'movie', 'occasionally', 'feels', 'aimless', 'formless', 'back', 'forth', 'plot', 'strands', 'characters', 'often', 'seem', 'cross', 'purposes', 'one', 'distinct', 'advantage', 'approach', 'movie', 'less', 'contrived', 'artificial', 'more', 'akin', 'real', 'life', 'sometimes', 'decidedly', 'unglamorous', 'nature', 'frustratingly', 'plodding', 'pace', 'actual', 'crime', 'detection', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'film', 'due', 'strictly', 'subject', 'matter', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'movie', 'grisly', 'topic', 'Zodiac', 'surprisingly', 'tame', 'blood-and-guts', 'department', 'thank', 'goodness', '.Indeed', 'movie', 'unnerving', 'murder', 'scenes', 'way', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'can', 'turn', 'full', 'attention', 'real', 'areas', 'interest', 'chronicling', 'behind-the-scenes', 'search', 'killer', 'exploring', 'psychological', 'impact', 'search', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'become', 'varying', 'degrees', 'obsessed', 'case', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'hit', 'career', 'high', 'water', 'mark', '2005', 'Proof', 'Jarhead', 'course', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'journey', 'edgy', 'roles', 'playing', 'Graysmith', 'rather', 'nerdy', 'cartoonist', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'who', 'managed', 'get', 'closer', 'unveiling', 'true', 'identity', 'killer', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'went', 'write', 'experiences', 'book', 'Zodiac', 'Unmasked', 'Identity', 'America', 'Most', 'Elusive', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'Revealed', 'film', 'based', 'Graysmith', 'was', 'able', 'scoop', 'even', 'lead', 'investigator', 'David', 'Toschi', 'sharply', 'played', 'always', 'interesting', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'life', 'becoming', 'ever', 'more', 'overtaken', 'case', 'longer', 'resolution', 'third', 'major', 'actor', 'drama', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'crime', 'beat', 'reporter', 'who', 'turned', 'drink', 'thereby', 'torpedoing', 'own', 'career', 'killer', 'singled', 'out', 'potential', 'target', 'lack', 'screen', 'time', 'allotted', 'Avery', 'one', 'genuine', 'disappointments', 'movie', 'especially', 'embodied', 'brilliant', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'own', 'life', 'experiences', 'make', 'perfect', 'choice', 'role.With', 'meticulously', 'mounted', 'pitch-perfect', 'recreation', 'details', 'case', 'as', 'well', 'times', 'took', 'place', 'Zodiac', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'termed', 'thinking', 'man', 's', 'thriller']",N/A

Overall, the changes are very subtle and wouldn't alter anybody's impression of the film. I marginally prefer it to the Theatrical cut (saw it 3 times in the cinema) and the "" fade to black"" audio montage suggests the passage of time better than just a caption. I am glad that Fincher got his preferred cut out to the public.ExtrasThe quality of the commentaries were mixed, Fincher is informative and entertaining as usual, 2nd commentary is amusing but both parties (actors and production team plus James Ellroy) seem to run out of steam as it nears the film's end. Ellroy's presence is interesting. Compared to the commentaries on the Seven or Fight Club SEs where all sides of the production were heard from and one couldn't help but feel that some corners were cut.How about a commentary from Savides, the DP or Burt the Production Designer? Or one by the REAL actors like Ruffalo, Edwards, Koteas, Hall or Getz? What about one by Graysmith, Toschi, Armstrong and others? Or a film scholar?No such luck.The SupplementsThe ""Film"" featurettesWhilst well produced (Shot similar to Errol Morris' Fog of War), beside the ""fly on the wall"" shots and audio excerpts (taken from the UK dvd release of the theatrical, which contains a more compact, epk style making of) there is no participation by Fincher, Savides, David Shire or any of the actors.The ""Facts"" featurettesAgain, all the core parties, with the exception Ken Narlow, Bryan Hartnell, Mike Mageau and a minute or so of Graysmith were MIA.One could argue that what Fincher, the actors and the characters/ people have to say was already represented in the film and that the supplements are just that, letting the first responders and civilians have their moment but considering the amount of research the production team were reported to have made, one also couldn't help but feel that their absence made the experience somewhat incomplete.What's also missing?Deleted scenesTantalising glimpses of a few were seen in the ""Film"" featurette.Maybe it's this set's 6 month delay (from the plain vanilla issue) or the fact that I got it immediately after viewing the Blade Runner 5 disc set (which has got to be the most complete and satisfying SE, ever*) made it a bigger let-down for me than it should.As it stands, this 2-disc DC edition is a more than competent studio release but a lackluster and surprisingly incomplete Fincher dvd (where ""lesser works"" like Alien 3 and Panic Room have superior/more comprehensive supplements). In Fincher's filmography only the The Game SE has ""less"" to offer.*The BR dvd set had the ability to turn me - a detached admirer - into a passionate ""fan"" of Blade Runner.",4,The Film is great but the DC DVD set lacks the film's attention to details,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,3292,"['one', 'better', 'dramas', 'emerge', 'studios', 'past', 'year', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'fact-based', 'films', 'Insider', '2', 'disc', 'Director', 'Cut', 'little', 'underwhelming.Considering', 'dvd', 'set', 'obviously', 'targeted', 'someone', 'appreciated', 'film', 'first', 'place', 'Fincher', 'completist', 'would', 'appear', 'Zodiac', 'theorists', 'revile', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'assassination', 'theorist', 'detested', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'set', 'eye', 'detail', 'completeness', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'Fincher', 'approved', 'SEs.The', 'Director', 'CutWhat', 'was', 'added', 'been', 'widely', 'publicised', 'already', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'Overall', 'changes', 'are', 'very', 'subtle', 'would', ""n't"", 'alter', 'anybody', 'impression', 'film', 'marginally', 'prefer', 'Theatrical', 'cut', 'saw', '3', 'times', 'cinema', 'fade', 'black', 'audio', 'montage', 'passage', 'time', 'better', 'just', 'caption', 'am', 'glad', 'Fincher', 'got', 'preferred', 'cut', 'public.ExtrasThe', 'quality', 'commentaries', 'were', 'mixed', 'Fincher', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'usual', '2nd', 'commentary', 'amusing', 'parties', 'actors', 'production', 'team', 'James', 'Ellroy', 'seem', 'run', 'out', 'steam', 'film', 'end', 'Ellroy', 'presence', 'interesting', 'Compared', 'commentaries', 'Seven', 'Fight', 'Club', 'SEs', 'where', 'sides', 'production', 'were', 'heard', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'corners', 'were', 'cut.How', 'commentary', 'Savides', 'DP', 'Burt', 'Production', 'Designer', 'one', 'REAL', 'actors', 'Ruffalo', 'Edwards', 'Koteas', 'Hall', 'Getz', 'What', 'one', 'Graysmith', 'Toschi', 'Armstrong', 'others', 'film', 'scholar', 'such', 'SupplementsThe', 'Film', 'featurettesWhilst', 'well', 'produced', 'Shot', 'similar', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'Fog', 'War', 'fly', 'wall', 'shots', 'audio', 'excerpts', 'taken', 'UK', 'dvd', 'release', 'theatrical', 'more', 'compact', 'epk', 'style', 'making', 'participation', 'Fincher', 'Savides', 'David', 'Shire', 'actors.The', 'Facts', 'featurettesAgain', 'core', 'parties', 'exception', 'Ken', 'Narlow', 'Bryan', 'Hartnell', 'Mike', 'Mageau', 'minute', 'so', 'Graysmith', 'were', 'MIA.One', 'could', 'argue', 'what', 'Fincher', 'actors', 'characters/', 'people', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'already', 'represented', 'film', 'supplements', 'are', 'just', 'letting', 'first', 'responders', 'civilians', 'have', 'moment', 'considering', 'amount', 'research', 'production', 'team', 'were', 'reported', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'absence', 'made', 'experience', 'somewhat', 'incomplete.What', 'also', 'missing', 'Deleted', 'scenesTantalising', 'glimpses', 'few', 'were', 'seen', 'Film', 'set', '6', 'month', 'delay', 'plain', 'vanilla', 'issue', 'fact', 'got', 'immediately', 'viewing', 'Blade', 'Runner', '5', 'disc', 'set', 'got', 'be', 'most', 'complete', 'satisfying', 'SE', 'ever*', 'made', 'bigger', 'let-down', '2-disc', 'DC', 'edition', 'more', 'competent', 'studio', 'release', 'lackluster', 'surprisingly', 'incomplete', 'Fincher', 'dvd', 'where', 'lesser', 'works', 'Alien', '3', 'Panic', 'Room', 'have', 'superior/more', 'comprehensive', 'supplements', 'Fincher', 'filmography', 'only', 'Game', 'SE', 'less', 'offer', '*The', 'BR', 'dvd', 'set', 'had', 'ability', 'turn', 'detached', 'admirer', 'passionate', 'fan', 'Blade', 'Runner']",N/A
1076883,A387BD735MI50R,B000QUCNOU,R. Schultz,"[2, 16]","This is a fairly good film, full of brooding and stalking. However my enthusiasm for the film was tempered a little by the clich&eacute; of its central theme - which is the obsession that one police detective develops with the case.The worst part of the clich&eacute; is the way the detective's wife is relegated to the shadows while he pursues his obsession. Actually, women play virtually no role in this film at all, except as victims. The whole film is the importance of men's concentrations. The detective's wife really has only one notable line in the movie, and that's to fadingly worry whether the carrots or some other dishes she's prepared for dinner - are warm enough. Eventually, as always happens in these cases, the marriage dissolves altogether and the detective is left to ponder the evidence in a state of increasing isolation and disintegration.How refreshing it would be to just once see a spouse plunge into an investigation with equal interest, the way Daphne does on an episode of ""Frasier,"" the TV sitcom. When health care provider Daphne sees Martin, the retired policeman, pouring over some old photos of a cold case murdered prostitute, she doesn't cringe, whine, and worry. She commands, ""Here, don't be a greedy guts! Let me have a look!""Of course, the Zodiac murders were no joke. But the spectacle of yet one more detective degenerating into the puzzle detracts from the unique seriousness of the case. There are also some splotches of illogic that detract from the film. For example, at one point the vulnerable detective accompanies a supremely creepy suspect down, alone, into an unlit basement. There was no good reason for the detective to expose himself to such danger, other than to establish this movie firmly in the category of ""thriller.""I was also disappointed that there was no commentary on this DVD version. It would have been interesting to know some more of the facts about the actual investigation, so I suggest you obtain a full Director's copy of this film.But the film's score largely makes up for any lapses.

Truth is, if we ever do find out, most of the people that were around at that time will be gone anyway. So who's left to find out. I can say if I were put in the position of cracking the case, I would get extremely fascinated by the changes that have been put in place for forensic evidence. When I really think about what they had to go off of back then I get weirded out that some of the common sense things didn't occur to investigators back then. Like not touching a piece of evidence sent in the mail, or what about taking DNA at the time that the crime scene was fresh. So strange. But I love how this movie chronicles all of that.

1076885,A2QDPJRVXL7P4F,B000QUCNOU,"Sahra Badou ""Bibliophile""","[5, 5]","It is horrifying to think that all the events in this movie actually took place, and more terrifying still that the serial killer might still be at large after over 30 years of evading the police. (Note: though the case is still open in many states, the killings have stopped, and the author, Robert Graysmith, believes the Zodiac is dead).This movie is not about the Zodiac killer himself, but about the people involved in his pursuit, and especially with the obsession of one police detective and one cartoonist to catch him. The killings are gruesome, with some victims repeatedly stabbed to death, while others shot at close range with a hand gun. None of the victims were sexually molested, and they were not robbed of their personal belongings. The killer derived pleasure from killing his victims. As he later tells police in letters sent to newspapers, he kills in order to collect his victims as slaves for the next life! He always started his letters with, ""This is the Zodiac speaking.""There was one instant where the killer might have been caught. After the Zodiac (as the killer calls himself) shoots a taxi driver, a police car is called to the scene after the gun shot is heard. However, witnesses mistakenly reported a black man at the scene. The Zodiac is a chubby white man. When the police arrive near the scene, they see the Zodiac walking, and stop by him to ask him if he had seen a black man in the area. He says yes and points to the direction he allegedly saw a black man with a gun running. If the police would have stopped and interviewed the Zodiac more closely, they would have seen his bloody hands. There is no telling what would have happened then. The policemen could have been shot dead, or maybe it would have been the other way around (there were two policemen in the car.) The Zodiac also called the police after committing some of the crimes - from phone booths adjacent to police stations!Another chilling instant was when the Zodiac stopped a pregnant woman and her child on a road claiming that her back tire was wobbling. He volunteered to fix the tire, and while the woman watched from her side view mirror, he appeared to do just that. However, as soon as she drove off, the back tire completely came off and she had to stop. She was then kidnapped by the Zodiac and driven around for almost an hour, as if the Zodiac was looking for an ideal place to kill her. However, the woman, together with her child, managed to jump out of the car, and escaped death!Not all of Zodiac's victims died. Although some victims were repeatedly stabbed, some survived! In all, it is believed that the Zodiac might have killed about 37 people.It was quite amazing how an amateur code breaker was able to break the coded letter of the Zodiac within a day and a night. After the coded letter was published in a newspaper, neither the FBI nor the police were able to decipher the letter. However, an amateur man did! The FBI should have hired him!This movie does follow the plot in the book `The Zodiac', by Robert Graysmith, who is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. This movie is much superior to other Zodiac movies I have seen. The acting is superb, and you will be kept in suspense throughout the movie. I did like the 70s look the movie portrayed.If you have read the book by Graysmith, I highly recommend this movie. If you haven't read the book, then I recommend reading it before watching this movie. The movie does tend to jump from one scene to another without much cohesion at times, and if you did not read the book, you might not understand what is going on. The movie is also pretty long (about 3 hours), and my friends, who did not read the book, found it boring. I was captivated only because I knew what was going on, and the movie refreshed my memory on many of the chapters of Graysmith's book.

It's a movie of shadows, noise and gunfire. It's about those nights when each grain of sand on a gravel road makes its own sound under the weight of a black Mustang.The movie embodies the intoxicating, bewildering, constant threat of murder, a phenomenon unique to a community invaded by a serial predator. Even Nebraskans have been touched by it: If you were a 6-year-old living in Omaha in 1983, you knew the artist's composite of the man who killed those two boys before you ever heard the name John Joubert.Yesterday I looked up Joubert's sketch online and saw those doe-like, alien eyes more than twice the size of his mouth, all under a blue ribbed stocking cap.I had nightmares about that drawing, about being snatched off the sidewalk and dumped in a ditch. Safety stickers went on windows. The FBI rolled into town and invaded our milk cartons. Kids stopped walking to school.That's the mood of ""Zodiac."" Its fuse may burn for almost three hours, but it must. James Vanderbilt's screenplay, based on Robert Graysmith's book, spans 15 years, and it ends with no one behind bars. Yet Graysmith's writing and director David Fincher's dreamy, elegant visuals, tightly grasp the moment and the obsession of the men hunting for San Francisco's most famous serial killer.Fincher opens the movie with the Zodiac's third and fourth known victims: a married woman and one of her misters parked on a lover's lane in Vallejo, Calif. Not long after this murder, he starts writing letters to the local newspapers, including the San Francisco Chronicle, where columnist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) spearheads the coverage, while cartoonist Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) lurks around the editorial conversations on how to cover the murders and how to help catch the murderer.Graysmith - divorced, nerdy and awkward - slowly evolves into the movie's key catalyst. He observes as the Zodiac leaves cryptograms concealing messages, courts the media, inspires false confessions and floods the two homicide cops assigned to his case, Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), with phony claims and leads.By the movie's final hour, Graysmith alone is pursuing the case with a zeal that costs him his family. The investigation, carried out over several years and split into three acts, is too dense and rich to explain in a review. What Fincher conveys is the pleasurable enormity of it.Like a novel, ""Zodiac"" sprawls out and revels in tiny details. It loves the names of places. It cares about whether the Zodiac killer wrote his ""k"" with two strokes or three. It's fascinated with the guy who knows a guy. It appreciates the trickiness of warrants. And it has the right - because it's unsolved - and the guts to sincerely invest in red herrings. It's about the pursuit of truth, not the revelation of it.The ensemble cast snugly fits into this story. Gyllenhaal may not be the ideal actor to play Graysmith - he's almost too wide-eyed - but he finds the right notes in the movie's final hour, when it's Graysmith's show.As Toschi, Ruffalo creates a man who inspired Steve McQueen's ""Bullitt:"" thick, tough, clever and clearly fond of haberdasheries. Edwards does a nice turn as the forthright partner.Downey, in one of his better recent performances, makes the writer Avery into a smart, cocky reporter chasing Hunter S. Thompson's lifestyle a little too passionately. When he crosses the line, he does it for the right reasons but gets burned by his ego and addictions. Dermot Mulroney, Philip Baker Hall, Brian Cox, Donal Logue and other actors play it completely straight in their supporting roles and play straight very well.And then there's John Carroll Lynch, who plays a prime suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen. He has only a few scenes, but they count. If you want to see a creep, watch this performance.""Zodiac"" is Fincher's most polished, mature work. ""Se7en"" might be a centerpiece of any 30-something's movie collection and ""Fight Club"" is, for all its absurdity, memorable pop culture. But ""Zodiac"" mixes Hitchcock and 1970s paranoia dramas without gunning the gas pedal, like Spike Lee's overwrought, unhinged ""Summer of Sam.""Fincher subtracts the flash of previous works to add cohesive professionalism. The movie has a certain, almost plastic sheen on it. The murders seem surreal and stage-like, cribbing from Errol Morris' famous documentary ""A Thin Blue Line"" and feeling like a Flannery O'Connor short story, when dread, violence and the Almighty converge for blood judgment.""Zodiac"" is ordinary enough to be unsettling and twisted enough to be compelling.

It's hard...","[9, 10]","In a dumbed-down film market where facts, context, background, details, personnel and personalities, and tedious albeit crucial connections and indicators are to be avoided at all costs as box office poison, I was very pleasantly surprised by this film's depth, in all of these aspects.  If you're a stickler for details, and if you ask questions, this film will work for you, as it did for me.  That being said, by the time the end titles rolled at two hours, 37 minutes, I was numb from the incessant cascade of leads and evidence and trails and personalities, and the genuinely palpable tension created by the characters and story, relieved it was done.""Cast"" is a wide-ranging concept here.  Gyllenhall and the top-billed are ever-present, as are many others, but the ensemble cast continues to grow, with important characters fading out as the story rolls on and others introduced as close as ten minutes from the end of the film.  This depth of cast is required to tell this story right, and I actually felt complimented as a viewer that they've made the decision to do this, confident in my ability to sort them, remember them, and see their place in the narrative.  As noted by others, it was great to see Anthony Edwards (Goose!) in a role he filled outstandingly.  I also loved Brian Cox's Melvin Belli portrayal, which for some reason just continued to remind me of Brando.The period attention to detail was absolutely superb, right down to the IBM Selectrics on the desks, and an airline flight announcement that smoking was only allowed in the last six rows.  I really loved the time-lapse sequence of the building of the Trans-America pyramid, and all of the mid-70s memories that this evoked.  The vehicles were spot-on, as was the costuming (Chloe Sevigny in her first appearance with that straight blond hair and glasses looking just like Marsha Brady), expertly complementing the obviously meticulous work that went into creating the different periods of time in which this story takes place.Overall, the story is about the trail of the killer, and how such a complex case with a huge depth of evidence ultimately has produced no true suspect, no arrest, and no conviction.  It's about competing jurisdictions, bureaucratic obstacles, lack of communication, personalities in conflict, the relationship between law enforcement, the press, and the judicial, and it's about how small things can be extremely meaningful . . . or maddeningly irrelevant.  In the end, a serial murderer remains at large.I particularly enjoyed the direct connection made to the 1971 classic, ""Dirty Harry,"" it's ""Scorpio"" bad guy openly based on the Zodiac killer.  But, as noted so well in the film, although a few suspects--and very, very suspicious guys they are--are identified, real life is not nearly as simple and straightforward as a .44 Magnum execution.The film gets its ""R"" rating for language and violence.  The foul language is not over the top (not ""Goodfellas""), and is directly relevant to the film.  The violence is rather scant, but it is very, very intense.  I say this as a longtime filmgoer who considers himself jaded in terms of cinematic portrayal of violence.  The opening scene recreates one of the early murders, and it is stark, graphic and highly unpleasant.  The lakeside murder scene is more so, extremely intense, and made me physically uncomfortable.  There are a couple of other ""killer"" scenes, but they are not nearly as difficult to watch as these first two.  I found myself wondering about the inclusion and meaning of this level of directly personal and highly emotional violence: I believe it is the content and conduct of these murders, the premeditation and brutality that after all drive the main characters.  This is the very reason for the story, and the viewer needs to remember these scenes as the motivators for the characters as the film moves on.To conclude, I thank the production team who did this film for providing me with the depth of cast, narrative, and story to let me participate in the hunt for the killer as well.  In this film I've been invited to an intellectual endeavor, and I found I enjoyed it.  I got (most of) the facts, and I can come to my own conclusions, and for that and the other reasons I list above, I heartily recommend this film.",4,"An Excellent, Highly Intelligent, Detail-Laden Marathon",1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,4302,"['dumbed-down', 'film', 'market', 'where', 'facts', 'context', 'background', 'details', 'personnel', 'personalities', 'tedious', 'crucial', 'connections', 'indicators', 'are', 'be', 'avoided', 'costs', 'box', 'office', 'poison', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'depth', 'aspects', ""'re"", 'stickler', 'details', 'ask', 'questions', 'film', 'will', 'work', 'did', 'being', 'said', 'time', 'end', 'rolled', 'two', 'hours', '37', 'minutes', 'was', 'numb', 'incessant', 'cascade', 'leads', 'evidence', 'trails', 'personalities', 'genuinely', 'palpable', 'tension', 'created', 'characters', 'story', 'relieved', 'was', 'done', 'Cast', 'wide-ranging', 'concept', 'here', 'Gyllenhall', 'top-billed', 'are', 'ever-present', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'grow', 'important', 'characters', 'fading', 'out', 'story', 'rolls', 'others', 'introduced', 'as', 'close', 'ten', 'minutes', 'end', 'film', 'depth', 'cast', 'required', 'tell', 'story', 'right', 'actually', 'felt', 'complimented', 'viewer', ""'ve"", 'made', 'decision', 'do', 'confident', 'ability', 'sort', 'remember', 'see', 'place', 'narrative', 'noted', 'others', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Goose', 'role', 'filled', 'outstandingly', 'also', 'loved', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Melvin', 'Belli', 'portrayal', 'reason', 'just', 'continued', 'remind', 'Brando.The', 'period', 'attention', 'detail', 'was', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'right', 'down', 'IBM', 'Selectrics', 'desks', 'airline', 'flight', 'announcement', 'smoking', 'was', 'only', 'allowed', 'last', 'six', 'rows', 'really', 'loved', 'time-lapse', 'sequence', 'building', 'Trans-America', 'pyramid', 'mid-70s', 'memories', 'evoked', 'vehicles', 'were', 'spot-on', 'was', 'costuming', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'first', 'appearance', 'straight', 'blond', 'hair', 'glasses', 'looking', 'just', 'Marsha', 'Brady', 'expertly', 'complementing', 'obviously', 'meticulous', 'work', 'went', 'creating', 'different', 'periods', 'time', 'story', 'place.Overall', 'story', 'trail', 'killer', 'how', 'such', 'complex', 'case', 'huge', 'depth', 'evidence', 'ultimately', 'produced', 'true', 'suspect', 'arrest', 'conviction', 'competing', 'jurisdictions', 'bureaucratic', 'obstacles', 'lack', 'communication', 'personalities', 'conflict', 'relationship', 'law', 'enforcement', 'press', 'judicial', 'how', 'small', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'extremely', 'meaningful', 'maddeningly', 'irrelevant', 'end', 'serial', 'murderer', 'large.I', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'direct', 'connection', 'made', '1971', 'classic', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Scorpio', 'bad', 'guy', 'openly', 'based', 'Zodiac', 'killer', 'noted', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'few', 'suspects', 'very', 'very', 'suspicious', 'guys', 'are', 'are', 'identified', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'simple', 'straightforward', '.44', 'Magnum', 'execution.The', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'language', 'violence', 'foul', 'language', 'not', 'top', 'not', 'Goodfellas', 'directly', 'relevant', 'film', 'violence', 'rather', 'scant', 'very', 'very', 'intense', 'say', 'longtime', 'filmgoer', 'who', 'jaded', 'terms', 'cinematic', 'portrayal', 'violence', 'opening', 'scene', 'one', 'early', 'murders', 'stark', 'graphic', 'highly', 'unpleasant', 'lakeside', 'murder', 'scene', 'more', 'so', 'extremely', 'intense', 'made', 'physically', 'uncomfortable', 'are', 'couple', 'other', 'killer', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'difficult', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'found', 'wondering', 'inclusion', 'meaning', 'level', 'directly', 'personal', 'highly', 'emotional', 'violence', 'believe', 'content', 'conduct', 'murders', 'premeditation', 'brutality', 'drive', 'main', 'characters', 'very', 'reason', 'story', 'viewer', 'remember', 'scenes', 'motivators', 'characters', 'film', 'moves', 'on.To', 'conclude', 'thank', 'production', 'team', 'who', 'did', 'film', 'providing', 'depth', 'cast', 'narrative', 'story', 'let', 'participate', 'hunt', 'killer', 'as', 'well', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'invited', 'intellectual', 'endeavor', 'found', 'enjoyed', 'got', 'most', 'facts', 'can', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'other', 'reasons', 'list', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

Whilst I enjoyed Se7en and Fight Club, they were a little showy--daring, but striving to be different. Zodiac is a more classical type of work; it's simply told, and Fincher lets the case draw the reader in rather than relying on effects. He draws two excellent performances from Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal. I can see why some critics think Downey is the best actor of his generation; his performance here is so real it's unnerving. Presumably drawing on his own addictions, Downey makes his character raw, and watching the performance is a moving experience. Gyllenhaal takes on the kind of role that Michael J. Fox did in Casualties of War--a kind of observer role (at least for a lot of the film). It's easy to overlook this kind of performance--it's super subtle and finely tuned.

1076902,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,B000QUCNOU,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[6, 9]","The exquisite Bay Area newspaper publicity ad for David Fincher's ZODIAC is in full color and shows the Golden Gate Bridge enshrouded in fog late at night and a figure standing where the ""I"" should be.  It is taken from an unusual angle, the northeast corner of Marin County from a low angle, not the northwest headlands.  And there is an existential caption:  ""There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer.""  The movie is an intelligent and suspenseful--and surprisingly bloodless, given the material and the director of ""SE7EN""--crime drama about the hunt for the serial killer known as ""The Zodiac"".  He terrorized the Bay Area from the late 1960's to the early 1980's, my college years, so this is a subject I know and feel passionate about.Instead of a routine police investigation without a satisfying ending, our three protagonists--brilliantly played by Robert Downey, Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, and Mark Ruffalo--are an ace SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE reporter named Paul Avery (Downey), CHRONICLE political cartoonist and cryptogram expert Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal), and homicide inspector Dave Toschi (Ruffalo).  The movie has been magnificently adapted by James Vanderbilt from two non-fiction books by Graysmith.  They play off each other perfectly.  Avery is an alcoholic chain-smoker, ideal for Downey.  Graysmith is literary, a non-smoker, and insistent on following up every last lead in the still-unsolved case.  And Toschi fights with his police superiors on crime county jurisdiction matters.  Like Graysmith, he is determined to find the killer.  Vanderbilt even finds a way to turn a minus into a plus with the still-unsolved crimes, by creating a movie about obsessed characters who are finally unable to wrap up their obsession neatly; the movie is spellbinding and haunting.I was afraid to see ZODIAC until I saw the beautiful publicity ad--I've seen movies for much worse reasons!--and the rave reviews from East Coast reviewers and national magazine critics.  But I still feared a bloodbath.  Fincher (FIGHT GAME, PANIC ROOM) surprised me as the director.  He shows a couple in a 1969 lover's lane being shot to death repeatedly (the guy in the car survived somehow) and a savage knife attack with another couple by a lake (Berryessa?).  And a cab driver in nighttime San Francisco is killed with just gun shots heard on the sound track.  Those are still the only five crimes actually pinned on the Zodiac Killer and the only ones depicted in the movie.  Everything else is talked and argued about in the CHRONICLE newsroom and police stations all over the Bay Area.  The last scene of BONNIE AND CLYDE (1967) has more blood than all of ZODIAC.Everyone really did their homework here.  There must be one hundred technical consultants and advisors on the end credits, representing seemingly every single county in the Bay Area, plus a few in Southern California as leads are followed up there.  Avery is now dead from his endless cigarettes and alcohol, but Graysmark was a technical advisor who, I believe, still lives in San Francisco.  (The final credit narrative crawl went by way too quickly for me.)  The editing is so tight and suspenseful, even at a long 158 minutes, that I could not find a single place to go out to the bathroom in the middle; so do that and get refreshments before you go into the theatre.  The production design captures my college years in both the Bay Area and Southern California to perfection, and David Shire's music score is appropriately brooding and mysterious.But more than anything else, ZODIAC is a powerful and flawless crime drama because of director David Fincher's artistry.  I have only seen his serial killer drama, SE7EN, which was a dark and powerful bloodbath; I should rent his PANIC ROOM and FIGHT CLUB.  ZODIAC seems like his crowning achievement, a work of art with a lingering impact long after you leave the theater.  It is in CinemaScope--my blasted CineMark  projection was wide enough for 2.35, but repeatedly cropped out  the extensive date and place captions at the bottom of the screen on a $7.00 matinee. The movie should play unnervingly well in a night bedroom on home video.  Perhaps even better.  Maybe you should wait--and get informative Zodiac Killer bonuses on DVD?--unless you have a theatre complex you know to be professional.  Century Plaza 10 in South San Francisco is a disgrace.  For the price of a couple going at night for $10 each, you could buy the movie on DVD in six months, a most sobering thought.",5,A moody knockout of a crime drama,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,4514,"['exquisite', 'Bay', 'Area', 'newspaper', 'publicity', 'ad', 'David', 'Fincher', 'ZODIAC', 'full', 'color', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'enshrouded', 'fog', 'late', 'night', 'figure', 'standing', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'unusual', 'angle', 'northeast', 'corner', 'Marin', 'County', 'low', 'angle', 'not', 'northwest', 'headlands', 'existential', 'caption', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'lose', 'life', 'killer', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'suspenseful', 'surprisingly', 'bloodless', 'given', 'material', 'director', 'SE7EN', 'crime', 'drama', 'hunt', 'serial', 'killer', 'known', 'Zodiac', 'terrorized', 'Bay', 'Area', 'late', '1960', 'early', '1980', 'college', 'years', 'subject', 'know', 'feel', 'passionate', 'about.Instead', 'routine', 'police', 'investigation', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'three', 'protagonists', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'are', 'ace', 'SAN', 'FRANCISCO', 'CHRONICLE', 'reporter', 'named', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'Downey', 'CHRONICLE', 'political', 'cartoonist', 'cryptogram', 'expert', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'Gyllenhaal', 'homicide', 'inspector', 'Dave', 'Toschi', 'Ruffalo', 'movie', 'been', 'magnificently', 'adapted', 'James', 'Vanderbilt', 'two', 'non-fiction', 'books', 'Graysmith', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'perfectly', 'Avery', 'alcoholic', 'chain-smoker', 'ideal', 'Downey', 'Graysmith', 'literary', 'non-smoker', 'insistent', 'following', 'up', 'last', 'lead', 'still-unsolved', 'case', 'Toschi', 'fights', 'police', 'superiors', 'crime', 'county', 'jurisdiction', 'matters', 'Graysmith', 'determined', 'find', 'killer', 'Vanderbilt', 'even', 'way', 'turn', 'minus', 'plus', 'still-unsolved', 'crimes', 'creating', 'movie', 'obsessed', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'finally', 'unable', 'wrap', 'up', 'obsession', 'neatly', 'movie', 'spellbinding', 'haunting.I', 'was', 'afraid', 'see', 'ZODIAC', 'saw', 'beautiful', 'publicity', 'ad', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'much', 'worse', 'reasons', 'rave', 'reviews', 'East', 'Coast', 'reviewers', 'national', 'magazine', 'critics', 'still', 'feared', 'bloodbath', 'Fincher', 'FIGHT', 'GAME', 'PANIC', 'ROOM', 'surprised', 'director', 'couple', '1969', 'lover', 'lane', 'being', 'shot', 'death', 'repeatedly', 'guy', 'car', 'survived', 'somehow', 'savage', 'knife', 'attack', 'couple', 'lake', 'Berryessa', 'cab', 'driver', 'nighttime', 'San', 'Francisco', 'killed', 'just', 'gun', 'shots', 'heard', 'sound', 'track', 'are', 'still', 'only', 'five', 'crimes', 'actually', 'pinned', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'only', 'ones', 'depicted', 'movie', 'Everything', 'else', 'talked', 'argued', 'CHRONICLE', 'newsroom', 'police', 'stations', 'Bay', 'Area', 'last', 'scene', 'BONNIE', 'AND', 'CLYDE', '1967', 'more', 'blood', 'ZODIAC.Everyone', 'really', 'did', 'homework', 'here', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'hundred', 'technical', 'consultants', 'advisors', 'end', 'credits', 'representing', 'seemingly', 'single', 'county', 'Bay', 'Area', 'few', 'Southern', 'California', 'leads', 'are', 'followed', 'there', 'Avery', 'now', 'dead', 'endless', 'cigarettes', 'alcohol', 'Graysmark', 'was', 'technical', 'advisor', 'who', 'believe', 'still', 'San', 'Francisco', 'final', 'credit', 'narrative', 'crawl', 'went', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', 'editing', 'so', 'tight', 'suspenseful', 'even', 'long', '158', 'minutes', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'single', 'place', 'go', 'out', 'bathroom', 'middle', 'so', 'do', 'get', 'refreshments', 'go', 'theatre', 'production', 'design', 'captures', 'college', 'years', 'Bay', 'Area', 'Southern', 'California', 'perfection', 'David', 'Shire', 'music', 'score', 'appropriately', 'brooding', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'ZODIAC', 'powerful', 'flawless', 'crime', 'drama', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'artistry', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'serial', 'killer', 'drama', 'SE7EN', 'was', 'dark', 'powerful', 'bloodbath', 'should', 'rent', 'PANIC', 'ROOM', 'FIGHT', 'CLUB', 'ZODIAC', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'work', 'art', 'lingering', 'impact', 'long', 'leave', 'theater', 'CinemaScope', 'blasted', 'CineMark', 'projection', 'was', 'wide', 'enough', '2.35', 'repeatedly', 'cropped', 'out', 'extensive', 'date', 'place', 'captions', 'bottom', 'screen', '7.00', 'matinee', 'movie', 'should', 'play', 'unnervingly', 'well', 'night', 'bedroom', 'home', 'video', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'Maybe', 'should', 'wait', 'get', 'informative', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'bonuses', 'DVD', 'have', 'theatre', 'complex', 'know', 'be', 'professional', 'Century', 'Plaza', '10', 'South', 'San', 'Francisco', 'disgrace', 'price', 'couple', 'going', 'night', '10', 'could', 'buy', 'movie', 'DVD', 'six', 'months', 'most', 'sobering', 'thought']",N/A

I went with a friend of mine to see SEVEN. It stayed with me for years, and still manages to give me the creeps. THE GAME. What can I say about THE GAME? One of the greatest mind benders of all time, also featuring one of Michael Douglas' best performances. FIGHT CLUB was marketed as a run of the mill action flick, when in actuality it is a deep, philosophical masterpiece that I loved. PANIC ROOM held me in suspense as well. I remember seeing it in Charlotte, amongst a very interactive audience, who were all screaming and hollering at the screen - ""RUN, JODIE, RUN!"" It was one of the most memorable - and one of the loudest - experiences that I have ever had at the theatre...And here comes ZODIAC in 2007. I missed the theatrical run, but I do remember that it opened on a Friday night while I just so happened to be in San Francisco, California with some of my college buddies. We opted to see BLACK SNAKE MOAN instead. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved BLACK SNAKE MOAN and all, but now that I have seen ZODIAC in all of it's glory, I wish that we had seen it instead. I can only imagine the impact this would have had on me in a full theatre, all blown up on a big screen. As it turns out, I missed it, but I did watch it for the very first time tonight. Talk about a film that can simutaneously creep you out and intrigue the piss out of you at the same time - this is it!I haven't been so caught up in a film like this since THE DEPARTED. I know that they're two different films, but that's not the point. I could not pull myself away from the television through the entire length, not even to use the bathroom. If I had to piss, I held it. I held it until my bladder was about to burst. The fact that they never caught this dude is so unsettling. There is a sense of mystery and dread that hangs over your head and STAYS there as the film ends, with Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" playing quietly in the background. I'll never be able to hear that song again without having this film spring to mind. You really come to respect all of the police and detectives who worked so diligently on the case. Til this day, they are still working on this case, according to the title cards at the end of the film.The performances are all excellent. Robert Downey, Jr. and Mark Ruffalo were totally ignored as far as Oscar consideration goes, and so was the film and it's wonderfully talented director. This is a change of pace for David Fincher. It is totally different from anything that he has done in the past, yet at the same time, he uses all the right flourishes that have worked before. The cinematography from Harry Savides (BIRTH, LAST DAYS) is brilliantly done. By the way, I also have to throw a shout out to Jake Gyllenhaal's wonderful performance as Robert Graysmith, a young cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who, over time, becomes more and more obessessed with the case.All in all, PERFECT film, and highly recommended to those who have the patience to sit through the two and a half running time without complaining.

A grandiose, sprawling movie, Zodiac documents the efforts San Francisco police went through to bring down its most notorious killer. Moving from the viewpoint of the victims, to detectives Toschi (Ruffalo) and Armstrong (Edwards), to the Zodiac-obsessed Chronicle cartoonist Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) and alcoholic reporter Avery (Downey Jr.), Fincher and writer James Vanderbilt (who adapted Robert Graysmith's book) leave no stone unturned in the hunt for the killer. So meticulous is their approach, to call Zodiac a slow burner is a major understatement, as in-depth analyses of crime scenes follow careful examination of the killer's psyche. Kicking off in 1968 and finishing up in the late '80s while simultaneously encompassing a whole host of fleshed-out characters and dead end plotlines, Fincher again attempts something different in a genre - an epic serial killer movie - and Zodiac is the JFK of serial killer movies, an All The President's Men of detective movies.

It drags a bit at times but the acting delivered by Jake Gyllenhall, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. makes this film completely engrossing. David Fincher's obsessive attention to detail also adds another layer to this film and gives the film that spark that it needs in convincing the viewer that what they're watching is really taking place in the late 60's/early 70's.

1076912,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000QUCNOU,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[4, 4]","Who would have thought that a filmmaker who has taken on aliens, fight clubs and the seven deadly sins could come out of five years of seclusion and release one of the most engaging and sprawling American pop epics? Though this may be the second time David Fincher has tackled serial killers, `Zodiac' proves to be the filmmaker's most mature and substantial work yet.While previous successes like `Seven' and `Fight Club' were taut, entertaining dramatic thrillers, the departure he makes with `Zodiac' may come as a surprise to many of ""Finch's"" cult following. Clocking in at two hours and forty minutes Fincher has to cover a lot of ground, chronicling the nearly decade long history of cat and mouse games played by The Zodiac Killer and the San Francisco Bay area. Where other director's have tried and failed to capitalize on the subject matter, Fincher, who grew up in the area that the proverbial boogeyman was claiming his victims, translates his childhood nightmares to the big screen through an engrossing story of obsession.`Zodiac' from start to finish is the story of Robert Graysmith's descent into mania over his fascination with the notorious killer. Graysmith, the author of the nonfiction novels upon which the screenplay was based, quickly becomes engrossed in the mystery of these seemingly unconnected strings of murders. From the moment The Zodiac sends his first letter to the San Francisco Chronicle in 1969 claiming responsibility for two separate, gruesome murders we watch as Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) goes from being a mere spectator to the last remaining hunter of the killer, going so far as to attract the attention of The Zodiac to himself.While there are several gruesome murders staged by Fincher in `Zodiac', the film is more along the lines of a newsroom drama like `All the President's Men'. Thanks to Fincher's mastery of maintaining dramatic tension, piecing together clues from evidence collected by Detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and chasing down anonymous tips with zany reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downy Jr.) becomes a mesmerizing, communal experience. Every time the characters find a new lead to fuel the chase, the audience becomes thoroughly engaged in the plot. With every stumbling block they encounter, the picture forces audiences to share the character's maddening frustration.Though it takes an incredible balancing act to make a film that is nearly three hours in length, `Zodiac' is the first picture to accomplish this feat since Hobbits last graced the big screen. Though quite a bit of this achievement should be credited to the Oscar worthy performances of Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey, it is Fincher's vision which makes `Zodiac' so successful.Though the tension and dark humor that carries `Zodiac' might seem like familiar Fincher, don't expect the MTV shooting and editing style that have been featured in his previous works. Fincher even went back and reshot several key scenes in `Zodiac' to make sure that the focus was placed primarily on the story at hand. The results are spectacular.While shots from `Fight Club' and `Panic Room' seemingly existed in an empty vacuum of style, every camera angle in `Zodiac' serves to further the story. Don't expect the camera to go through floorboards and walls; Fincher has finally found a way to balance what is visually enticing with how to tell an absorbing story.Speaking of visuals, credit has to be given to cinematographer Harris Savides for creating a moody, film look on high definition video. Still thought by many stuffy Hollywood hotshots to be an inferior visual medium, Fincher and Savides have added yet another gorgeous example as to why films shot in HD are a force to be reckoned with.With `Zodiac' David Fincher has moved from merely being a stylistic director of a handful of cult classics into a master filmmaker. The five year hiatus and the engrossing obsession with The Zodiac Killer have served the filmmaker well; he has harnessed his keen visual style with his storytelling abilities to create the first truly substantial piece of cinema in 2007.-Joe Russo",5,Zodiac Movie Review,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,4102,"['Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'taken', 'aliens', 'fight', 'clubs', 'seven', 'deadly', 'sins', 'could', 'come', 'five', 'years', 'seclusion', 'release', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'sprawling', 'American', 'pop', 'epics', 'may', 'be', 'second', 'time', 'David', 'Fincher', 'tackled', 'serial', 'killers', 'Zodiac', 'proves', 'be', 'filmmaker', 'most', 'mature', 'substantial', 'work', 'yet.While', 'previous', 'successes', 'Seven', 'Fight', 'Club', 'were', 'taut', 'entertaining', 'dramatic', 'thrillers', 'departure', 'Zodiac', 'may', 'come', 'surprise', 'many', 'Finch', 'cult', 'following', 'Clocking', 'two', 'hours', 'forty', 'minutes', 'Fincher', 'cover', 'lot', 'ground', 'chronicling', 'nearly', 'decade', 'long', 'history', 'cat', 'mouse', 'games', 'played', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'area', 'Where', 'other', 'director', 'have', 'tried', 'failed', 'capitalize', 'subject', 'matter', 'Fincher', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'area', 'proverbial', 'boogeyman', 'was', 'claiming', 'victims', 'childhood', 'nightmares', 'big', 'screen', 'engrossing', 'story', 'obsession.', 'Zodiac', 'start', 'finish', 'story', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'descent', 'mania', 'fascination', 'notorious', 'killer', 'Graysmith', 'author', 'nonfiction', 'novels', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', 'quickly', 'engrossed', 'mystery', 'seemingly', 'unconnected', 'strings', 'murders', 'moment', 'Zodiac', 'first', 'letter', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', '1969', 'claiming', 'responsibility', 'two', 'separate', 'gruesome', 'murders', 'watch', 'Graysmith', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'being', 'mere', 'spectator', 'last', 'remaining', 'hunter', 'killer', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'attract', 'attention', 'Zodiac', 'himself.While', 'are', 'several', 'gruesome', 'murders', 'staged', 'Fincher', 'Zodiac', 'film', 'more', 'lines', 'newsroom', 'drama', 'President', 'Men', 'Thanks', 'Fincher', 'mastery', 'maintaining', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'piecing', 'together', 'clues', 'evidence', 'collected', 'Detective', 'David', 'Toschi', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'chasing', 'down', 'anonymous', 'tips', 'zany', 'reporter', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'Robert', 'Downy', 'Jr.', 'mesmerizing', 'communal', 'experience', 'time', 'characters', 'find', 'new', 'lead', 'fuel', 'chase', 'audience', 'thoroughly', 'engaged', 'plot', 'stumbling', 'block', 'encounter', 'picture', 'audiences', 'share', 'character', 'maddening', 'incredible', 'balancing', 'act', 'make', 'film', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'length', 'Zodiac', 'first', 'picture', 'accomplish', 'feat', 'Hobbits', 'last', 'graced', 'big', 'screen', 'quite', 'bit', 'achievement', 'should', 'be', 'credited', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performances', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Ruffalo', 'Downey', 'Fincher', 'vision', 'Zodiac', 'so', 'tension', 'dark', 'humor', 'Zodiac', 'might', 'seem', 'familiar', 'Fincher', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'MTV', 'shooting', 'editing', 'style', 'have', 'been', 'featured', 'previous', 'works', 'Fincher', 'even', 'went', 'back', 'reshot', 'several', 'key', 'scenes', 'Zodiac', 'make', 'sure', 'focus', 'was', 'placed', 'primarily', 'story', 'hand', 'results', 'are', 'spectacular.While', 'shots', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Panic', 'Room', 'seemingly', 'existed', 'empty', 'vacuum', 'style', 'camera', 'angle', 'Zodiac', 'serves', 'further', 'story', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'camera', 'go', 'floorboards', 'walls', 'Fincher', 'finally', 'found', 'way', 'balance', 'what', 'visually', 'enticing', 'how', 'tell', 'absorbing', 'story.Speaking', 'visuals', 'credit', 'be', 'given', 'cinematographer', 'Harris', 'Savides', 'creating', 'moody', 'film', 'look', 'high', 'definition', 'video', 'Still', 'thought', 'many', 'stuffy', 'Hollywood', 'hotshots', 'be', 'inferior', 'visual', 'medium', 'Fincher', 'Savides', 'have', 'added', 'yet', 'gorgeous', 'example', 'why', 'films', 'shot', 'HD', 'are', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'with.With', 'Zodiac', 'David', 'Fincher', 'moved', 'merely', 'being', 'stylistic', 'director', 'handful', 'cult', 'classics', 'master', 'filmmaker', 'five', 'year', 'hiatus', 'engrossing', 'obsession', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'have', 'served', 'filmmaker', 'well', 'harnessed', 'keen', 'visual', 'style', 'storytelling', 'abilities', 'create', 'first', 'truly', 'substantial', 'piece', 'cinema', '2007.-Joe', 'Russo']",N/A

Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr., along with a wealth of well-known actors in small, supporting roles, ""Zodiac"" is a very good yet imperfect film suffering from two problems. More on that later.July 4, 1969. Vallejo, California. A teenage boy, impatient with his girlfriend when she is late to pick him up, doesn't realize she has a plan and they soon end up at a make-out point. Before they are able to get very far, a car speeds up behind them and the driver gets out and shoots them. Then an ominous letter arrives at the San Francisco Chronicle. The writer claims to be the killer and includes a cipher demanding the paper print it on the front page, he wants a different part of the same cipher printed in the San Francisco Examiner and a locaL Vallejo paper. If they don't, the killing spree will continue. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a political cartoonist at the Chronicle, gets a look at the cipher and tries to solve it. A couple of days later, two retired school teachers solve the cipher and turn it into the paper. Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), a reporter at the Chronicle, is in the room when the letter is read, so he gets the story and starts to verify the information revealed. Later, a cabbie picks up a fare in downtown San Francisco. Stopping on a residential street, the passenger shoots the cabbie and takes part of his bloody shirt. Detective Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner, Detective Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), investigate and soon everyone realizes the killer of both of these people is one and the same. In a future letter, the killer identifies himself as Zodiac and all of the parties begin a long investigation taking them to many dead ends, through many career and life changes, and into an obsession with finding the true identity of this elusive killer.From the opening frames of ""Zodiac"", we realize we are in the hands of a filmmaker who has gone to great pains to recreate a time and an era, to add authenticity to the story. A wide shot of San Francisco bay, complete with fireworks, leads to a traveling shot down a residential street in Vallejo. We see various people playing with fireworks in front of their homes. We see the obligatory families with the large fireworks, overdoing it, trying to make everyone jealous. Wait, what was that? Two mothers sharing a smoke outside of a garage? Yes, that's exactly what it was. Not every director would even bother to show this type of detail, but because Fincher does, we realize he is going to take us for a ride, showing us as much detail, relevant or not, good or bad, as he can. He wants to make a definitive portrait of the hunt for this killer, so he will provide us with a lot of detail; considering the length of the investigation, perhaps too much detail. This is why the film clocks in at over two and a half hours; there is a lot of story to tell and Fincher isn't willing to take any shortcuts.The details are presented in a clear and concise fashion. Each scene begins with a date and time stamp, helping us orient the lengthy, ongoing investigation. Some scenes are very brief, others present information leading Graysmith or Toschi in a wrong direction. This is all part of the investigation and therefore, part of the story of the hunt for the Zodiac.""Zodiac"" is more of a police procedural than I was expecting. It does this well, as mentioned, giving us a clear picture of the investigation, warts and all, showing us many of the leads the detectives or Graysmith follow. But the film is lacking in suspense. It isn't a requirement that a film of this nature have suspense, but given Fincher's last few films, and the subject matter, I kind of expected it. The film is very good, but a little suspense sprinkled throughout would help the film move at a faster pace and seem less long than it actually is. At two hours and forty minutes, you feel every minute of it when you get up and leave the theater. There are a couple of moments when Fincher seems to say ""oh, screw it"" and tries to inject some suspense, but these attempts are half hearted and do little more than help to establish another fact or make the film just a bit longer.The performances are universally good, but they are pretty low key, with Gyllenhaal exuding the most energy and Downey Jr. adding little interesting touches to his portrayal of the reporter who chronicles the story of the killer for the San Francisco newspaper.As soon as Graysmith gets a look at the first cipher, he is hooked. A political cartoonist for the newspaper, he admits that he enjoys puzzles. A number of other people, the FBI, Naval Intelligence, try to solve the puzzle, but a pair of retired professors successfully decodes the message. When Graysmith looks at their solution, the last line is left blank and he realizes they were unable to figure it out. As they receive more coded messages, he becomes more and more obsessed with discovering the identity of the killer, as though Zodiac's identity is a puzzle of its own.Throughout ""Zodiac"", Gyllenhaal seems slightly frantic. During a blind date with Melanie (Chloe Sevigny), he is preoccupied and more concerned with the whereabouts of Paul Avery (Downey, Jr.). Inexplicably, they end up living together and have children before his obsession takes over completely. Finally, he decides to write a book, but as the investigation goes on for a long time, the book takes a long time. Graysmith wants to make sure he has all of the information.Mark Ruffalo is fairly low key as Detective Toschi. So often, we see film detectives who blow up at the slightest provocation, presumably the filmmaker's way of making the detective seem believable, when in fact it simply makes them seem like a cartoon. Fincher keeps things very neutral; arguments between Toschi and Armstrong are more of a disagreement, when they interrogate suspects, they raise their eyebrows when something doesn't fit. There is no good cop/ bad cop here. During the course of the film, Graysmith and Toschi attend the premiere of ""Dirty Harry"" and his hunt for the `Scorpio Killer'. This is Fincher's way of indicating to us how `real' he is trying to make this experience. As they leave the theater, someone remarks the suspect got shot in the back. At the time, they were not close to uncovering the identity of the killer, so the story is clearly fictionalized. Also, Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan couldn't be further from Mark Ruffalo's Toschi, a detective clearly more realistic than Eastwood's famous, iconic character.Ruffalo's Toschi is also obsessed with finding the killer, but he seems more cognoscente of how the system works. He knows he has to work other cases, and won't be able to keep the case open forever. Therefore, he occasionally loses hope only to have Graysmith uncover a new lead and pull him back into the mix again, getting his hopes up again.Robert Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery, the Chronicle reporter who becomes the lead reporter on the case. Downey brings a few moments of levity to the film, portraying Avery as a cross between a free wheeling reporter in the late 60s, experimenting with everything San Francisco has to offer, and Noel Coward. Avery isn't beyond saying what he is thinking, but he quickly covers up any faux pas with an acerbic remark. At one point, he and Graysmith are talking over drinks in a seedy bar. After Avery takes a hit of cocaine, he notices Graysmith's blue drink, complete with umbrella and states ""That drink can longer be ignored"". Graysmith offers a sip and the dubious Avery tries it. Cut to a table with twelve empty glasses, the remains of the watery blue drink in each.Avery's cavalier attitude gets him into more than one dangerous situation and he seems less intent on trying to figure out ho the killer is than with keeping his job, in an effort to maintain his lifestyle. Graysmith visits the reporter late in the story, after he no longer works for the Chronicle, to find him living in a seedy house boat, unwilling to get too worked up about the latest lead.The film features a wealth of well-known actors taking on smaller roles. Anthony Edwards plays Toschi's partner, Detective Armstrong. He is basically a sounding board for Toschi, and they share the same temperament. John Carroll Lynch (best known as Drew Carey's brother on ""The Drew Carey Show"") plays Arthur Leigh Allen, one of the suspects. In his few scenes, he quickly establishes his creepiness and makes us realize he could possibly be carrying out these murders. Brian Cox plays Melvin Belli, the San Francisco attorney who helped to set the stage for people like Johnnie Cochran and other superstar lawyers. Charles Fleischer (the voice of ""Roger Rabbit"") makes a quick appearance as a revival movie theater owner who may hold the key to the mystery. Dermot Mulroney plays Toschi's boss, the head of the Detective squad. Elias Koteas, James Le Gros, Clea Duvall and many others make quick appearances.""Zodiac"" is a very well made film, presenting the most important details of the lengthy hunt for this elusive killer. I like the film's attempts to show us the wrong turns the investigation takes, showing us the red herrings. I simply wish the performances held a little more fire, a little more passion. And I wish the film had a little more suspense, a little more excitement. But director David Fincher has created a thorough, well-made procedural to present his theories about the identity of the killer.",4,6ix,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,9685,"['highly', 'anticipated',

1076915,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000QUCNOU,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[4, 5]","The worldview of Director David Fichner has always been a dour and dark one. From his first big splash of the wildly underratedAlien 3and the the genre redefiningSe7en, he approaches the noir of details like few others. However, this attention to the underbelly takes a toll on ""Zodiac,"" a serial killer film that spends more time on the soul killing of the killer's trackers than on the killer itself.The movie is basically a two-parter, with the first detailing real-life San Francisco Chronicle reporter Paul Avery (an animatedly off-center Robert Downey Jr, giving early glimpses at his soon to exlpode comeback), an SF Homicide Detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and the killer as he picks off his victims in a rather non-sensationalist manner. The victims pile up and the city is thrown into paranoia, Avery and Toschi become obsessed with catching this modern-day Jack The Ripper. When he stays constantly one step ahead of capture and cunningly taunts his pursuers, everyone involved begins to spiral down. Once Avery suspects he is in the killer's cross-hairs, he no longer can report and soon becomes another kind of victim.That's when ""Zodiac"" lurches into a lumbering and poorly paced second half. Editorial Cartoonist and real-life author of this film's source book,Zodiac, Robert Graysmith becomes inexplicably obsessed with the killer and begins to pick up where everyone else gave up. The problem is that Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) was just incidental to the first half of the film, and he was more annoying than purposeful. When he blossoms into this full-blown super-snoop, it barely seems plausible. And given that almost all the main characters from the first 90 minutes have disintegrated in their failure to apprehend Zodiac, the movie becomes Gyllenhaal's to carry.As Graysmith's obsession to the case becomes more neurotic, freneticism takes over and paranoid raves/rants/red herrings begin to overwhelm the character and the movie. Gyllenhaal pounding on Detective Toschi's window at midnight in the pouring rain was almost cringe inducing, as was the claustrophobic basement scene with the former film-house owner. Graysmith, like the others chasing The Zodiac ahead of him, soon gets pulled into the vortex with unsavory results. Yet in the first part of the film, there were multiple people getting torn apart in this investigative black hole, making ""Zodiac"" palpable. Graysmith's trip down the cliff is tedious and, frankly, unbelievable.While the grim circumstances are played to a fair historical accuracy and with Fichner's customery cool manner, a little judicious editing might have trimmed this to a more palatable film. There are too many detours and sidelines, making ""Zodiac"" something close to a documentary than a drama, which leaves you without any good guys or bad guys. Towards the end, I just wanted Graysmith to STFU and finish his book, and couldn't even root for the anti-hero suspect (a creepy John Carroll Lynch), because anyone worth cheering for was now soul-dead. The final credit postlogue told the story of just how deeply the players were all affected, but ""Zodiac"" is primarily about the victims the murderer let live; Toschi, Avery and Graysmith, and how he killed them all the same.",3,"Dear Editor, This is the Zodiac Speaking",1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,3245,"['worldview', 'Director', 'David', 'Fichner', 'always', 'been', 'dour', 'dark', 'one', 'first', 'big', 'splash', 'wildly', 'underratedAlien', '3and', 'genre', 'redefiningSe7en', 'noir', 'details', 'few', 'others', 'However', 'attention', 'underbelly', 'toll', 'Zodiac', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'more', 'time', 'soul', 'killing', 'killer', 'trackers', 'killer', 'itself.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'two-parter', 'first', 'detailing', 'real-life', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'reporter', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'animatedly', 'off-center', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'giving', 'early', 'glimpses', 'soon', 'exlpode', 'comeback', 'SF', 'Homicide', 'Detective', 'David', 'Toschi', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'killer', 'victims', 'rather', 'non-sensationalist', 'manner', 'victims', 'pile', 'up', 'city', 'thrown', 'paranoia', 'Avery', 'Toschi', 'become', 'obsessed', 'catching', 'modern-day', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'When', 'constantly', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'capture', 'cunningly', 'taunts', 'pursuers', 'everyone', 'involved', 'spiral', 'down', 'Once', 'Avery', 'killer', 'cross-hairs', 'no', 'longer', 'can', 'report', 'soon', 'kind', 'victim.That', 'when', 'Zodiac', 'lumbering', 'poorly', 'paced', 'second', 'half', 'Editorial', 'Cartoonist', 'real-life', 'author', 'film', 'source', 'book', 'Zodiac', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'inexplicably', 'obsessed', 'killer', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'everyone', 'else', 'gave', 'up', 'problem', 'Graysmith', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'was', 'just', 'incidental', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'annoying', 'purposeful', 'When', 'full-blown', 'super-snoop', 'barely', 'plausible', 'given', 'almost', 'main', 'characters', 'first', '90', 'minutes', 'have', 'disintegrated', 'failure', 'apprehend', 'Zodiac', 'movie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'carry.As', 'Graysmith', 'obsession', 'case', 'more', 'neurotic', 'freneticism', 'paranoid', 'raves/rants/red', 'herrings', 'begin', 'overwhelm', 'character', 'movie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'pounding', 'Detective', 'Toschi', 'window', 'midnight', 'pouring', 'rain', 'was', 'almost', 'cringe', 'inducing', 'was', 'claustrophobic', 'basement', 'scene', 'former', 'film-house', 'owner', 'Graysmith', 'others', 'chasing', 'Zodiac', 'ahead', 'soon', 'pulled', 'vortex', 'unsavory', 'results', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'were', 'multiple', 'people', 'getting', 'torn', 'apart', 'investigative', 'black', 'hole', 'making', 'Zodiac', 'palpable', 'Graysmith', 'trip', 'cliff', 'tedious', 'frankly', 'grim', 'circumstances', 'are', 'played', 'fair', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Fichner', 'customery', 'cool', 'manner', 'little', 'judicious', 'editing', 'might', 'have', 'trimmed', 'more', 'palatable', 'film', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'detours', 'sidelines', 'making', 'Zodiac', 'something', 'close', 'documentary', 'drama', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'end', 'just', 'wanted', 'Graysmith', 'STFU', 'finish', 'book', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'root', 'anti-hero', 'suspect', 'creepy', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'anyone', 'worth', 'cheering', 'was', 'now', 'soul-dead', 'final', 'credit', 'postlogue', 'told', 'story', 'just', 'how', 'deeply', 'players', 'were', 'affected', 'Zodiac', 'primarily', 'victims', 'murderer', 'let', 'live', 'Toschi', 'Avery', 'Graysmith', 'how', 'killed', 'same']",N/A

Director David Fincher took the original memoir of San Francisco Chronicle journalist Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie) and fashioned it into a story that is less a whodunit than it is a character study of obsession and its consequences. We may never know the truth about the crazed killer, but this film gives us a good idea of what Graysmith and various other journalists, cops, and Feds went through in their pursuit of him. By concentrating on victims and bystanders rather than the perp himself, Fincher has managed to convey a sense of the true horror of violent crime. He's also made a suspense film that Hitchcock himself would admire. The entire cast is excellent, and the sense of time and place (1960s-70s San Francisco) is vivid. I'll never forget it.

1076919,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B000QUCNOU,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[3, 4]","Movie - 5.0 / 5.0I've always found the mystery genre to be pretty engrossing, especially when it has either a perplexing case to solve, a long or epic narrative, empathetic or interesting characters, or a combination of these. I tend to get my fill of said sleuthing and drama these days from the likes of House M.D., The Mentalist, Castle, and Lie to Me, which are fine and dandy considering they're just TV shows and are thus somewhat limited by their episodic nature and production budgets. Suffice it to say, though, David Fincher really captivated me with his work in Se7en and its unrelenting visceral assault on the senses. Its shock value, grittiness, and downright dark atmosphere were such an eye-opener to the genre (for me, anyway) that it remains one of my all-time favorite films and amongst the top in its class. And then he made Zodiac. While I love Se7en for all that it is stylistically, I dare even say Zodiac barely surpasses it in three ways: 1) the fact that it's a period piece and thus, has more realism (not to mention a lot of this actually happened at some point), 2) is over half an hour longer, which doesn't necessarily add to the characters, but boy does it accentuate the plot, and 3) the sheer amount of obsession as portrayed by the characters of Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), and to a lesser extent, Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.).That being said, Se7en and Zodiac are both crafty masterpieces in their own rights. But much like how Se7en infused the genre from a more emotional approach with its shock and grotesqueness, Zodiac seems to drive itself with much more technicality using facts, evidence, and frankly, a drier style of investigation to present itself. Not to discredit Se7en for being any less sleuthy, but I believe Zodiac to be slightly more enjoyable for its methodical nature, down-to-earth character portrayals, and massively engaging screenplay.  It's all about subtlety and attention to detail, much like the aforementioned TV shows listed above, and I was especially delighted to see such a depiction over what seems to, historically, be a very interesting case. Everything from the production, cinematography, score, script, and even sound design have a very low-key feel to them, yet in the end add a real sense of fascination and awe to the entire ordeal and the events that took place over the span of the investigation. And while the case never was solved, Fincher made a very entertaining depiction of it.Video - 5.0 / 5.0- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1Zodiac was shot using the Thomson VIPER FilmStream Camera (a digital camera for those who care) and digitally mastered at 2K resolution. The result is a stunning and gorgeous transfer to Blu-ray. Black levels are the best part of the overall presentation with an amazing amount of definition, even amidst a lot of the darkly-lit venues and nighttime shots with all the little lines in clothing, shading, and texturing easily viewable. The smoke of cigarettes is especially pronounced whenever people were smoking them in a scene. Any shot of Paul Avery smoking up a storm, while subtle like the entire movie itself, looks great. Contrast handles perfectly with every bit of stubble visible on the closeup shots of Graysmith's face. Flesh tones, facial features, you name it; not a single visual element on any person or thing is lost or distorted throughout the entire duration of the film. I shutter to even think about how smudgy/blurry this would look on DVD.As for the colors, they're as natural as you can expect. From the various costuming of the era (late '60s through the '70s), I have to applaud cinematographer Harris Savides, production designer Donald Graham Burt, and art director Keith P. Cunningham for opting to go with a retro look on a contemporary camera. In most period pieces I've seen that take place in the '60s and '70s, rarely do I ever envision it looking as pristine as this. More often than not, titles like this usually end up looking somewhat washed up or a little desaturated through filters and such, which is thankfully not the case here at all. The clothes, their colors, and even the set looks as I'd imagine the '60s and '70s to ""feel"" like despite the actual picture being so sharp and gloriously rendered. My favorite scenes for reference are any of the office shots at The Chronicle for its ridiculously clean closeups, any part where people are smoking cigarettes (as much as I despise the act of smoking itself, it looks pretty damn striking in HD if you're any kind of videophile), or the scene where Graysmith goes down into Bob Vaughn's basement (only two 40W bulbs were used to light that entire room, which just goes to show how amazing the that Thomson VIPER camera is). This is reference video all the way.Audio - 4.5 / 5.0Languages- English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1Subtitles- English, English SDH, French, SpanishIn response to all the other reviews I've read around the Internet about the audio being bad, I have to disagree with the low ratings. Yes, Zodiac is extremely dialogue-centric. It's a methodical, meat-and-potatoes, long-winding, and very technical investigation that relies more on plot progression, mood, and visual presentation for its atmospherics as opposed to the loud, bombastic, razzle dazzle mixes we've heard in other Fincher films. Ren Klyce's sound design is very subtle here with not a whole lot in terms of quantity, though he makes for it with quality. A good deal of the sound effects happen either in crowded areas (The Chronicle's offices) or in the more suspenseful moments (when Zodiac commits or is about to commit a murder). Dialogue, obviously, is not a problem. For all the talking there is, not a single line is lost, and even the phone calls sound very precise. The center channel does most of the work, while various background effects have great directionality and separation during the more busy sequences across the fronts. The opening credits is a good example of what I mean.The score by David Shire fits the period well, and the mood of the film even more so, and as we see the first letter from Zodiac make its way from the mail truck up the secretary, there's a very understated amount of depth and fidelity amongst all the doors, carts, typewriters, and telephones ringing all around the place. This is about as much as you'll hear from the rear speakers until the movie gets to other crowded scenes (people on the streets, visits at the police station, or any of the musical montages for the passing of time). Like I said, it's a sound design that's less about quantity and more about quality. For all the Fincher films I've heard Klyce mix that are on BD, I have to say the guy knows what he's doing. And if Fincher wanted to go a little quieter for this particular title, then so be it. It's no sonic powerhouse like Se7en or Fight Club beforehand, but for what it's worth and for what the film is, I'm fine with the way the movie is presented.  My favorite parts are the aforementioned opening credits (lots of busy bodies and noises, the scene where Zodiac attacks the couple by the lake (it's silently disturbing with no music, all the rustling grass, blowing wind, and stabbing and screaming at the end of it), and finally the part where Graysmith is in the basement with Bob Vaughn (for just really creepy atmospherics overall).Extras - 5.0 / 5.0Disc 1- Audio Commentary (Director David Fincher)Fincher goes through many of the nuts and bolts about the making of the film. I especially like how he keeps everything in a sort of ""present tense"" mindset whenever he talks about a particular aspect of the movie and its filming. When said factoid or comment occurs, he talks about it vividly in great detail as if he were reliving the moment right there, only with the occasional anecdote to compliment it. I also like the fact that he doesn't get too anecdotal when talking about the actors on screen. Comments about them usually tend to be about casting, preparation for the role, and any of the quirks/experiences that occurred during the many, many, many takes he did with them on set. In addition, he talks about what it was like working with the real Robert Graysmith, Dave Toschi, and other people who were involved in the case and how the film portrayed them and the events that unfolded. I was also very surprised at all the parts Fincher pointed out that were either matte painting or blue screen backgrounds. They really fooled me the whole time into thinking that was just stellar production design. And finally, Fincher makes mention of the various parts they wrote took some dramatic licenses (which I feel worked pretty well).- Audio Commentary (Actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr.; Producer Brad Fischer, Screenwriter James Vanderbilt, and Author James Ellroy)The two groups were recorded separately and dispersed into various locations of the film, but it's an entertaining listen, nonetheless. Most of the commentary comes from the executive side with Fischer and the two James' talking about a multitude of elements from the making of the movie, the interpretations and themes within the plot, how the actual events affected the lives of all the people and communities involved, and various anecdotes that range from jokey to insightful. The commentary from the actors. has more to do with recollections of filming, acting (as well as a few stories here and there), and there own interpretations of the characters and writing. There's a wealth of information to be heard on this track that compliments Fincher's commentary very well, so fans of the film should definitely give it a listen every now and again. I only wish the actors commentary would've included Mark Ruffalo as well, since he played such a huge part as Dave Toschi and provided such a fantastic performance in the process.Disc 2The special features are divided into 2 sections: The Film and The Facts (one for the movie and the other for the actual historical events).The Film- Zodiac Deciphered (HD; 54:15 altogether)A pretty in-depth look at the making of Zodiac. It covers a wide range of of the technical work that went from the idea of the movie to the construction of all the sets, how they were shot, the actors and how they portrayed the characters, and even a little of the theme analysis at the end. You can play all the featurettes together or.. individually, but who'd want to do that? For those who are curious, though, here's the breakdown of the individual features:- Zodiac Deciphered (5:23)Discusses the original rights lapse from Disney and how producer Brad Fischer was able to get it from the real Robert Graysmith himself. He and screenwriter James Vanderbilt had initially thought of Fincher from the get-go thinking he would actually turn it down. Obviously, it's a good thing he didn't.- Blue Rock Springs (8:09)Talks mostly about the location scouting of Blue Rock Springs and how they chose a slightly different spot in the movie since the real location had changed over the years. Of interesting and morbid note is also the fact that they had the real Darlene Ferrin's clothes from evidence to make an exact replica of for the actress.- The San Francisco Chronicle (13:12)Tells how they built the office from scratch and went to great lengths for the props. In addition to old telephones, they even went so far as to dig up the microfilm with the original newspaper publications from the real-life reports that were printed during the time of the actual killings. They also show a warehouse full of period clothing, and one funny little bit of Fincher doing 36 takes to get the right throw of a book on a car seat (that's dedication right there).- The Hall of Justice (6:27)Looks mainly at the casting of Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi and Anthony Edwards as Bill Armstrong. They show pictures of their actual counterparts for comparison, and the resemblances are remarkable. At one point, they even had the real Dave Toschi on set giving out autographed boxes of animal crackers.- Presidio Heights (5:06)Talks about the difficulty they had with shooting on location (as alluded to by Fincher's audio commentary on Disc 1 about a Homeowner's Association). To get around that problem, they built a set to double for shooting and used blue screens and CG to insert backgrounds, houses, and vehicles. Needless to say, they did an amazing job that certainly fooled me.- Lake Barryessa (7:27)Starts off with the real Robert Graysmith talking about how impressed he was with Fincher's ability to realize they weren't even in the original spot when they initially got there for scouting. And when they finally did get the right spot, they actually had to plant their own shrubs and trees because so much of it had eroded over the course of time. In addition, there's an interesting anecdote involving Fincher and a 1-thread alteration to the Zodiac's mask.- Obsession (8:27)Discusses some of the movie's themes and how the information they compiled for the plot was actually not available because the police wouldn't release it publicly. This feature also makes special mention of the fact that the point of the story is not establish the premise that Arthur Leigh Allen was the Zodiac, but that Graysmith and Toschi believed him to be, and that the real conclusion is anyone's guess since the case was never solved even to this day. Everything up to this point is either conjecture or just circumstance.- The Visual Effects of Zodiac (HD; 15:18)This featurette covers the amount of stunning work that went into, what apparently, was the work of the visual effects gurus. Specifically, the gorgeous opening shot of San Fransisco in the opening credits was completely CG'd. Originally, they had taken still photos of the city using the Thomson VIPER with a longer lens and used those as reference for the correct lighting and structure detail. They also point out that Paul Stine's cab ride around San Fransisco, his bloddy murder, the Kathleen Johns, and the Transamerica Pyramid sequences were all either computer generated or composited as well. Again, great work by that team, I really couldn't tell the difference.- Pre-VisualizationBlue Rock Springs (SD; 1:06)Lake Barryessa (SD; 4:21)San Fransisco (SD; 1:02)- Theatrical Trailer (HD; 2:32)The Facts- This Is The Zodiac Speaking (HD; 1:42:18 altogether)A massive feature that gives a haunting recollection of the murders Zodiac took credit for in his letters. Each segment includes interviews from the police officers involved, various experts, and even the survivors of the attacks. Each piece also includes case photos from the crime scene investigations, evidence from those who passed (such as Darlene Ferrin and Paul Stine's clothes), and even vintage footage from the actual TV reports. The present-day interviews with the people were a lot more intense than I thought they'd be, especially when they go into detail about the actual attacks themselves. It's sort of an unreal and horrifying story to listen to when you've actually seen the movie and then listen to the words straight from the person that nearly died those nights. For all the emotions a movie can induce from its script, screenplay, and cinematography, I'd be hard-pressed not to say that this entire feature isn't scarier than the movie itself. Definitely give this a watch if you're like me and don't know much about the case in general, but are intrigued, regardless. Here's a breakdown of the segments individually:- Lake Herman Road (13:15)- Blue Rock Springs (22:44)- Lake Barryessa (37:33)- San Fransisco (28:45)- Prime Suspect: His Name Was Arthur Leigh Allen (HD; 42:35)Since the book was written by Graysmith and thus adapted with the source material in which he compiled for us to believe that Zodiac was Allen, much of this feature focuses on said assumption using interviews with the officers, experts, and people involved with the investigation. It's a fascinating discussion about all the facts they did find and includes personal accounts from Bob Cheney (the man that knew Allen right before the killings started) as well as Ralph Spinelli (who claims to have encountered Allen with some pretty striking allegations that made Allen seem even more suspect afterward). It's a very in-depth look at the man a lot of people believed to be the culprit and should definitely be watched at least once for any fan of the film or case.Overall - 5.0 / 5.0I first saw this movie in '09 when I was lucky enough to find the Blu-ray on sale for $13 somewhere and don't regret the blind-buy one bit. I've become a big fan of David Fincher within the last 5-ish years and really appreciate his directing prowess and attention to detail. I'm too young to actually have lived through the happenings of these events, but the occasional crime case (whether it be real or fictional) is a cool way to keep my mind sharp, and I find it spectacular when someone can actually adapt these real-world crimes into some kind of television or cinematic gem that transcends beyond itself into something even more (in this case, something of a retrospective phenomenon). The acting, production value, and writing are all stupendous in this film. It's engrossingly epic and obsessively entertaining. The video quality is immaculate in HD, and while the audio presentation is subtle and nuanced (much like the film and its writing elements), it's as accurate a representation as you could ask for when given the moments on screen. Best of all, though, are a couple of excellent commentaries and an exhausting amount of supplements covering both the filming and real-life facts behind the entire Zodiac arc. This should be a must-own for fans of Fincher, and especially those who enjoy murder-mysteries.",5,Zodiac (Director's Cut) (Blu-ray),1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,17845,"['Movie', '5.0', '5.0I',

1076921,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000QUCNOU,trebe,"[1, 1]","Based on the activities of the Zodiac Killer, Zodiac (2007) is a dramatization of some of the real life events that occurred in California beginning in 1969.  It's a film that captures quite well the look, feel, and vibe, of the time, and features some very good performances by a strong cast, as the story is mostly told by following the activities of San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith.  The film is based on Graysmith's book ""Zodiac"".Directed by David Fincher (The Game, Aliens 3), comparisons of Zodiac to his film Se7en (1995) might perhaps be unfair, but are probably inescapable.  Se7en, a tense, edgy, thriller, is general acknowledged as a masterpiece in the serial killer genre, with riveting performances by Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.  Real life seldom plays as dramatically as fiction, and while Zodiac has some truly chilling moments, and does a solid job of storytelling, the overall impact, particularly in light of the way the story concludes, is rather anticlimactic in comparison.  While each film is very dark, with a much tighter focus and an identifiable killer, it is Se7en that probably leaves the more lasting impression, is more rewatchable, and has deservedly developed a huge fanbase.  So unfair as it may be, some may regard Zodiac as falling short in comparison.Zodiac opens with a shooting in a lovers' lane in Vallejo in 1969.  Later, the killer sends letters with coded messages to the newspapers in San Francisco.  Taunting the police and involving the media, have become standard ploys in fictional crime dramas, but back then these were relatively new developments in real life.  The story unfolds following the activities of Chronicle reporters Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), along with SFPD detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards).Graysmith proves to be adept at solving puzzles and tuning into the killer's psychology.  Several murders follow, and the investigation heats up, as the Zodiac killer continues to taunt the police.  The notoriety causes hysteria to grow, however solid leads are scarce, and positive progress regarding the case is slow in coming.The release of Clint Eastwood's movie Dirty Harry (1971), loosely based on the Zodiac case, is featured in the film.  Unfortunately, while Harry Callahan brings his prey to justice in spectacular fashion, the real Zodiac case remains open.  As the years drag on, many of the central figures drop out, eventually leaving Graysmith as one of the few still working on the case.  The film does a fine job of capturing the nature of the investigation, and the toll it takes on those involved.  A fanatical Graysmith continues to investigate, and Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch) emerges as a suspect, but there is no solid physical evidence against him.  Allen dies in 1991, leaving the Zodiac case unsolved, and the film concludes in a somewhat anticlimactic manner.Zodiac deserves high praise for effectively telling the story of the investigation, one that proved not to have a storybook ending.  With some strong acting performances, it's a film worth seeing, but probably not one that many will be anxious to revisit.  It starts out strongly, and nicely builds momentum, but it begins to lose steam in the second half as time begins to stretch out.  David Fincher's interest in doing the film, after having already done Se7en was apparently very personal, as he lived in Northern California at the time of the initial killings, and as a young boy, was affected by the threats Zodiac made against schoolchildren.For those who really want to delve deep into the case history, the two disc director's cut edition contains a ton of informative bonus material, including two commentary tracks (one by Fincher), and an in depth documentary covering the actual investigation.  For those with a casual interest, the single disc director's cut should suffice.",4,reality often isn't as exciting as fiction...,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,3974,"['Based', 'activities', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'Zodiac', '2007', 'dramatization', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'occurred', 'California', 'beginning', '1969', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'look', 'feel', 'vibe', 'time', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'strong', 'cast', 'story', 'mostly', 'told', 'following', 'activities', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'film', 'based', 'Graysmith', 'book', 'Zodiac', '.Directed', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Game', 'Aliens', '3', 'comparisons', 'Zodiac', 'film', 'Se7en', '1995', 'might', 'perhaps', 'be', 'unfair', 'are', 'probably', 'inescapable', 'Se7en', 'tense', 'edgy', 'thriller', 'general', 'acknowledged', 'masterpiece', 'serial', 'killer', 'genre', 'riveting', 'performances', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Real', 'life', 'seldom', 'as', 'dramatically', 'fiction', 'Zodiac', 'truly', 'chilling', 'moments', 'solid', 'job', 'storytelling', 'overall', 'impact', 'particularly', 'light', 'way', 'story', 'concludes', 'rather', 'anticlimactic', 'comparison', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'much', 'tighter', 'focus', 'identifiable', 'killer', 'Se7en', 'probably', 'more', 'lasting', 'impression', 'more', 'rewatchable', 'deservedly', 'developed', 'huge', 'fanbase', 'So', 'unfair', 'may', 'be', 'may', 'regard', 'Zodiac', 'falling', 'short', 'comparison.Zodiac', 'opens', 'shooting', 'lovers', 'lane', 'Vallejo', '1969', 'Later', 'killer', 'letters', 'coded', 'messages', 'newspapers', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Taunting', 'police', 'involving', 'media', 'have', 'become', 'standard', 'ploys', 'fictional', 'crime', 'dramas', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'relatively', 'new', 'developments', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'following', 'activities', 'Chronicle', 'reporters', 'Paul', 'Avery', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'SFPD', 'detectives', 'Dave', 'Toschi', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Bill', 'Armstrong', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', '.Graysmith', 'proves', 'be', 'adept', 'solving', 'puzzles', 'tuning', 'killer', 'psychology', 'Several', 'murders', 'follow', 'investigation', 'up', 'Zodiac', 'killer', 'taunt', 'police', 'notoriety', 'hysteria', 'grow', 'however', 'solid', 'leads', 'are', 'scarce', 'positive', 'progress', 'regarding', 'case', 'slow', 'coming.The', 'release', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'Dirty', 'Harry', '1971', 'loosely', 'based', 'Zodiac', 'case', 'featured', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'Harry', 'Callahan', 'prey', 'justice', 'spectacular', 'fashion', 'real', 'Zodiac', 'case', 'open', 'years', 'drag', 'many', 'central', 'figures', 'out', 'eventually', 'leaving', 'Graysmith', 'one', 'few', 'still', 'working', 'case', 'film', 'fine', 'job', 'capturing', 'nature', 'investigation', 'toll', 'involved', 'fanatical', 'Graysmith', 'investigate', 'Arthur', 'Leigh', 'Allen', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'suspect', 'solid', 'physical', 'evidence', 'Allen', '1991', 'leaving', 'Zodiac', 'case', 'unsolved', 'film', 'somewhat', 'anticlimactic', 'manner.Zodiac', 'deserves', 'high', 'praise', 'effectively', 'telling', 'story', 'investigation', 'one', 'proved', 'not', 'have', 'storybook', 'ending', 'strong', 'acting', 'performances', 'film', 'seeing', 'probably', 'not', 'one', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'anxious', 'revisit', 'out', 'strongly', 'nicely', 'builds', 'momentum', 'lose', 'steam', 'second', 'half', 'time', 'stretch', 'out', 'David', 'Fincher', 'interest', 'doing', 'film', 'having', 'already', 'done', 'Se7en', 'was', 'apparently', 'very', 'personal', 'lived', 'Northern', 'California', 'time', 'initial', 'killings', 'young', 'boy', 'was', 'affected', 'threats', 'Zodiac', 'made', 'schoolchildren.For', 'who', 'really', 'want', 'delve', 'deep', 'case', 'history', 'two', 'disc', 'director', 'cut', 'edition', 'ton', 'informative', 'bonus', 'material', 'including', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'Fincher', 'depth', 'documentary', 'covering', 'actual', 'investigation', 'casual', 'interest', 'single', 'disc', 'director', 'cut', 'should', 'suffice']",N/A

It's like the perfect storm. For one thing it's exceptionally beautiful to look at. Cinamotographer Harris Savides captures the terror of San Francisco during this era with washed out often cold looking images. And Fincher produces a film that feels like something that came out of the 70s, it's a throw back film all the way. There are no huge action sequences, there are no explosions just simple storytelling and effective filming techniques. Fincher got lucky with his cast too. Jake Gyllenhaal give an exceptionally good and restrained performance of a man falling down an obsessive rabbit hole. As always Robert Downey Jr. is the real standout as Paul Avery, Zodiac shows that even though most people know him for Iron Man now, Downey is still one of the greatest actors of his generation. A special mention should go to Mark Ruffalo who plays the lead detective on the Zodiac case. He's a man who once inspired Steve McQueen in Bullit, but as time goes on we see a man tired and at a loss on a case that he just cant understand.

1076924,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000QUCNOU,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","""Zodiac"" is a film about one of the famous serial killers, directed by David Fincher who had previously given us ""Se7en."" You may think Fincher's latest film is made in the same vein as Brad Pitt's hit thriller with his trademark camerawork, but ""Zodiac"" is actually more like fact-based, dialogue-driven thrillers of the 1970s such as ""All the President's Men.""But of course ""Zodiac"" is about the notorious killer (which, it is said, inspired the first ""Dirty Harry"" film) and it starts with the brutal killing of a young couple in a car. The film includes more than one murder scenes and they are all very scary, or suspenseful at least, but the scare comes from the matter-of-factness of the killer and that of the director, who, instead of gores, opted for the minute descriptions of each case with a surprisingly subdued touch.The film suggests one theory about the identity of the murderer, but Fincher's intention is not clearly to solve this still mysterious case, so please don't demand what you cannot get here, something like sense of closure. He is more interested in the process in which some people were involved in, and attracted to this unusual case, someone like cartooninst-turned-writer Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), whose obsession drives him to what he believes is true. And the film is wonderful in showing the credible portraits of the police detectives and the complicated police procedures that are often frustrating.The film is very long (running time about 160 minutes) and its latter half drags a little, which is probably an inevitable thing, considering what happened, or didn't happen, in the real life.

There is some suspence and mystery, but for a film and true life event where there was no acual ending, it didn't really matter. There is alot of facts, but also alot of speculation and fabrication going on with this movie.The story of the Zodiac killer is actually quite interesting but again, since the case was never really solved, and with the movie not really doing anything except revisiting that span of time, the movie feels a tad wasted.The acting is really the redeaming quality of this film, with everyone doing a fantastic and believable job, especially Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal. They really worked well onscreen. However, a major fact remains that their respective characters were actually never even friends in real life.

1076930,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000QUCNOU,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 1]","On July 4th, 1969 I was lighting firecrackers in Vallejo, California 6 miles away from where the second Zodiac murder took place. It was a difficult time-the Summer of Love along the Haight-Ashbury district had degenerated into a hazy wash of drug dealers peddling to Hippies that were descending into junkies and Vallejo, California the town best known for the Naval Base Mare Island and the city where Raymond Burr was raised had a reputation as a quiet town so our parents were shocked when news of the murder rocked the town. It wasn't the first murder in Vallejo but it was the unusual nature of the murder itself; the killer who called himself the Zodiac mailed ciphers to the San Francisco Chronicle, Examiner and the Vallejo Times-Herald threatening to go on a killer spree unless the newspapers published his ciphers. He then taunted the police and FBI in the Bay Area to try and figure out his identity as he killed more people. My brothers were teenagers at the time and as further news of the Zodiac's body count increased my parents were more nervous about what would happen to my brothers after dark than whether or not they were remembering to use rubbers.David Fincher's new film captures that nervous time extremely well in his new film ""Zodiac"". Based on the book by former Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith, the film covers those obsessed with catching the killer as well as the killer's deeds themselves. Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) obsesses over the killer, his use of cryptology to communicate. Graysmith becomes involved with the police officer (Mark Ruffalo) and the writer (Robert Downey Jr. who gives a perfect performance) covering the case for the Chronicle. Slowly Grarysmith finds that the Zodiac takes over his life and he becomes more focused with finding the man behind the mask and letters as the police gradually give up on the case. With marvelous supporting performances from Anthony Edwards, Chloe Sevigny, Brian Cox, Fincher injects a film that could have faltered because of the large time span and the fact that the outcome is known (there was a suspect identified but the police didn't have enough evidence until much too late) into a riveting if flawed film.All the signs are here for a solid transfer from Paramount-accurate flesh tones and a crisp looking presentation with solid blacks. The audio is nicely used creating an environment that will creep you out if you listen to it in 5.1 with its use of ambient effects. Shot with HD video camera, the image does look a bit murky during some of the darker scenes but overall looks quite good.This edition is bare bones and comes only with previews/trailers for other films. One of the trailers though does advertise for a two disc deluxe set that will have extensive extras on the film and the case. I'd suggest waiting for that deluxe edition and renting this edition.A terrific film from director David Fincher receives a nice looking presentation that has a major flaw-no extras or commentary tracks. There will be a deluxe edition later in early 2008. I'd suggest waiting for that edition and renting this in the meantime.",4,"Fincher's ""Zodiac"" riveting but we get a bare bones DVD-Director's Cut will have extras",1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,3125,"['July', '4th', '1969', 'was', 'lighting', 'firecrackers', 'Vallejo', 'California', '6', 'miles', 'away', 'where', 'second', 'Zodiac', 'murder', 'took', 'place', 'was', 'difficult', 'time-the', 'Summer', 'Love', 'Haight-Ashbury', 'district', 'had', 'degenerated', 'hazy', 'wash', 'drug', 'dealers', 'peddling', 'Hippies', 'were', 'descending', 'junkies', 'Vallejo', 'California', 'town', 'best', 'known', 'Naval', 'Base', 'Mare', 'Island', 'city', 'where', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'was', 'raised', 'had', 'reputation', 'quiet', 'town', 'so', 'parents', 'were', 'shocked', 'when', 'news', 'murder', 'rocked', 'town', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'murder', 'Vallejo', 'was', 'unusual', 'nature', 'murder', 'killer', 'who', 'called', 'Zodiac', 'mailed', 'ciphers', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'Examiner', 'Vallejo', 'Times-Herald', 'threatening', 'go', 'killer', 'spree', 'newspapers', 'published', 'ciphers', 'then', 'taunted', 'police', 'FBI', 'Bay', 'Area', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'identity', 'killed', 'more', 'people', 'brothers', 'were', 'teenagers', 'time', 'further', 'news', 'Zodiac', 'body', 'count', 'increased', 'parents', 'were', 'more', 'nervous', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'brothers', 'dark', 'not', 'were', 'remembering', 'use', 'rubbers.David', 'Fincher', 'new', 'film', 'captures', 'nervous', 'time', 'extremely', 'well', 'new', 'film', 'Zodiac', 'Based', 'book', 'former', 'Chronicle', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Graysmith', 'film', 'obsessed', 'catching', 'killer', 'as', 'well', 'killer', 'deeds', 'Graysmith', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'killer', 'use', 'cryptology', 'communicate', 'Graysmith', 'involved', 'police', 'officer', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'writer', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'perfect', 'performance', 'covering', 'case', 'Chronicle', 'Slowly', 'Grarysmith', 'Zodiac', 'life', 'more', 'focused', 'finding', 'man', 'mask', 'letters', 'police', 'gradually', 'give', 'up', 'case', 'marvelous', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Fincher', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'faltered', 'large', 'time', 'span', 'fact', 'outcome', 'known', 'was', 'suspect', 'identified', 'police', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'evidence', 'much', 'too', 'late', 'riveting', 'flawed', 'film.All', 'signs', 'are', 'here', 'solid', 'transfer', 'Paramount-accurate', 'flesh', 'tones', 'crisp', 'looking', 'presentation', 'solid', 'blacks', 'audio', 'nicely', 'used', 'creating', 'environment', 'will', 'creep', 'out', 'listen', '5.1', 'use', 'ambient', 'effects', 'Shot', 'HD', 'video', 'camera', 'image', 'look', 'bit', 'murky', 'darker', 'scenes', 'overall', 'quite', 'good.This', 'edition', 'bare', 'bones', 'only', 'previews/trailers', 'other', 'films', 'One', 'trailers', 'advertise', 'two', 'disc', 'deluxe', 'set', 'will', 'have', 'extensive', 'extras', 'film', 'case', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'waiting', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'renting', 'edition.A', 'terrific', 'film', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'nice', 'looking', 'presentation', 'major', 'flaw-no', 'extras', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'will', 'be', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'later', 'early', '2008', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'waiting', 'edition', 'renting', 'meantime']",N/A

Many (dare I say most) of them are conceived from a murder scenario.  In the case of &#34;Zodiac&#34;, however, it seems as if the biggest mystery of them all was right under our noses all the time.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Zodiac&#34; tells the story of the Zodiac killer in California from the late 1960s-early 1970s.  In the early stages of the case, police investigator David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and SF Chronicle journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) struggle to catch the letter-writing, cypher-creating homicidal killer.  In the end, however, it ends up being low-on-the-totem-poll Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) who puts all the pieces together...or does he?If you are a fan of action/adventure fare and like a lot of &#34;flash&#34; up on the big screen, please stay away from this movie.  &#34;Zodiac&#34; is all about savoring the mystery, and thusly unfolds at pace that allows the thinking-viewing to do just that.  Before seeing this movie, I had zero previous information about these murders (far, far before my time), so it was utterly fascinating to me to see the amount of time it took for everything to play out.  At almost two and a half hours, viewers can't be looking at their watches or they will be missing the point.It would have been easy for &#34;Zodiac&#34; to come across as a B-movie cop drama, but I think that the presence of director David Fincher (&#34;Se7en&#34;, &#34;Fight Club&#34;, &#34;The Social Network&#34;, etc.) makes it into an all-time great.  Fincher knows exactly how to walk the fine line of keeping a movie pretty much devoid of &#34;action&#34; (in the traditional blow/shoot-em-up Hollywood sense) from getting stale, and instead just continuing to build the tension with every scene.Thus, &#34;Zodiac&#34; is a film I can highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of mystery fare.  The fact that it is based on real-life events makes it even more intriguing.  Just make sure you go into the experience with the right mindset and with plenty of time to savor this kind of filmmaking.
