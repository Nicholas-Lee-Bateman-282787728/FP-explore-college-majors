1215228,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B001LMU1BO,Andrew Raker,"[11, 13]","While the acting in this film (especially Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard's) is excellent, I really disliked the altered ending. The ending is NOT Shaw's ending nor did Shaw approve of the ending. While I understood the themes Shaw was trying to convey throughout most of the film, the altered ending left me questioning, ""What am I supposed to take away from this film? What am I supposed to learn?""After a bit of research, I realized that having Eliza reunited with Higgins goes against the entire structure of the play. Higgins is not supposed to be rewarded. In his own epilogue to the play (written in 1941), Shaw clearly displays his disgust with the ending of this film adaptation. Higgins is NOT supposed to receive a happy ending because Higgins REFUSES to alter his behavior.Because of the ending, I recommend the 1973 BBC adaptations, which follows Shaw's epilogue.Even though the acting in the 1973 adaptation is quite inferior to the 1938 adaptation, I still believe this 1938 adaptation is worthy of 3 stars while the 1978 adaptation should receive no more than 2 stars. (I would have given this 1938 film adaptation 5 stars except for the ending, which is the same as the ending in ""My Fair Lady"", although it pre-dates the musical.)However, this said, if you can accept the altered ending, by all means purchase this 1938 Leslie Howard adaptation.",2,Ending is the only drawback ...,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,1362,"['acting', 'film', 'especially', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'excellent', 'really', 'disliked', 'altered', 'ending', 'ending', 'NOT', 'Shaw', 'ending', 'did', 'Shaw', 'approve', 'ending', 'understood', 'themes', 'Shaw', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'most', 'film', 'altered', 'ending', 'left', 'questioning', 'What', 'am', 'supposed', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'What', 'am', 'supposed', 'learn', 'bit', 'research', 'realized', 'having', 'Eliza', 'reunited', 'Higgins', 'entire', 'structure', 'play', 'Higgins', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'rewarded', 'own', 'epilogue', 'play', 'written', '1941', 'Shaw', 'clearly', 'disgust', 'ending', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Higgins', 'NOT', 'supposed', 'receive', 'happy', 'ending', 'Higgins', 'REFUSES', 'alter', 'behavior.Because', 'ending', 'recommend', '1973', 'BBC', 'adaptations', 'Shaw', 'epilogue.Even', 'acting', '1973', 'adaptation', 'quite', 'inferior', '1938', 'adaptation', 'still', 'believe', '1938', 'adaptation', 'worthy', '3', 'stars', '1978', 'adaptation', 'should', 'receive', 'more', '2', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'given', '1938', 'film', 'adaptation', '5', 'stars', 'ending', 'same', 'ending', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'musical', 'However', 'said', 'can', 'accept', 'altered', 'ending', 'means', 'purchase', '1938', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'adaptation']",Pygmalion

1215237,A1RSXQ8KI7RS8B,B001LMU1BO,Melvyn H. Weinstein,"[12, 13]","Charles Laughton was Shaw's first choice for this film, gratefully; he was talked out of it. Leslie Howard delivers one of his great performances as Higgins.  He captures the snide sarcasm, without hitting it with a hammer.  Howard was famous for underplaying and even taught this to his friend, Humphrey Bogart. Bogart's second child is named in his honor.The problem with Harrison is that he is far too old for the part and even older for the film.  It is hard to suggest a romance under those conditions.  Howard is in his early 40s and looks a bit younger. Shaw did not consider this a love story but it clearly becomes that, more than the social satire that was intended.Harrison also declaims the role, as if he was a bit hard of hearing.  One can understand this approach on stage but it gets tiresome on film, where subtlety is appreciated.  Howard explores the nuances of the role without over-blowing the emotion.  He mines it for every comic twist. His timing is infallible and Hiller is the perfect foil for his tyranny.Watch his eyes, he has some of the most expressive peepers in the business and knew how to use them for the camera. (Ronald Colman was also famous for his ability to act through his eyes.) Howard was nearsighted and loved playing roles that allowed him to wear his glasses.  There are several such parts in his catalogue.  Suggest you check out `The Stand In,"" with Bogart.  Of course the ""Scarlet Pimpernel,"" is a must. ""Pimpernel Smith,"" a wonderful remake of his original film.Many films can be found on Amazon and other sites and are worth having.  ""Pygmalion,"" is beautifully restored and there is a wonderful new Shaw box with Wendy Hiller in ""Major Barbara,"" featuring a younger and better suited Rex Harrison. ""Caesar and Cleopatra,"" with Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains.  There are many more great films out there and his real genius,  is tragically unappreciated in GWTW.  It was his least favorite role, and the one for which he is best remembered.  A shame.....""Pygmalion,"" only suggests the realization of a romance at the very end and that was as intended. We are confident that they get together but Shaw leaves us wondering how and when.For those who only know Leslie Howard from GWTW, this film is a revelation.  He hated ""Wind..."" and only did it as a favor in return for staring in and producing Ingrid Bergman's first American film, ""Intermezzo.""Howard returned to England where he directed and starred in several fine films during the war.  He also did a great deal of documentary work for the war effort.  He was killed in 1943 while on a trip to Portugal, when his plane was shot down by the Germans. The exact nature of that trip is still in question.  He was just 50.  It is not generally known that Howard was Jewish, of Hungarian extraction.  He married out of the faith and was not very concerned about religion but his hatred of the Nazis is obvious from his work. Had he lived, he might have developed into a fine actor/director, such as Wells or Eastwood or Chaplin.  Even so, the work that he leaves is a testament to his great talent.A lesser known fact is, that despite a wife and two kids, he was one of the most insatiable ladies' men in Hollywood.  Joan Blondel said that he could sit between two women and flirt with both and make them believe it.  Bette Davis remembered that she held him at arm's length for three films.  One of his children wrote that he could never avoid the female temptations of Hollywood but always came home to his family.  Ironic, for a man who cultivated the exact opposite image. He was also an amazing polo player and loved horses.  Surprising, that he did not play more roles that took advantage of his skills as a horseman.
