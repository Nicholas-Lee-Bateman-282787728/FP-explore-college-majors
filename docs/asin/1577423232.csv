192448,A1L43KWWR05PCS,1577423232,Lawyeraau,"[12, 12]","I saw this movie on Lifetime, the cable television network for women. It is a very romantic, though highly improbable, film. Through illness, a young mother and wife (Reba McEntire) is in a coma for twenty years of her life. Her husband (Tim Matheson) remains devoted to her, bringing her home from the hospital, when the hospital said that there was nothing more that could be done for her. Her husband said that he married her for better or for worse and ensconced her in their home, providing her with constant care and attention.Meanwhile, the years pass by. Their beloved young daughter grows up, but Reba is always at the center of it all, as they talk to her, sing to her, and pattern her movements. Every care and consideration is given her, as she lays sleeping, seemingly insentient to her surroundings. Her best friend has looked after her daughter and husband, as if they were her own. When the best friend's husband dies, the husband and the best friend comfort each other. Then, the amazing happens. Reba wakes up from her twenty year coma and fights to regain her life, her husband, her daughter, and her best friend.This is the story about their struggle as a couple and as a family to regain what has been dormant, but not lost. Reba McEntire gives a beautiful performance as the wife and mother struggling to reclaim her life and finding herself in a world she no longer recognizes and in a body that has aged twenty years since she last saw it. Ms. McEntire has an immensely likable persona and magnetic personality that shines through in this role.Tim Matheson gives a sensitive and moving performance, as the devoted husband who finds himself initially conflicted as he struggles between the love he has for his wife and the love he feels for her best friend. He ultimately makes the only choice that he could make, as he finds himself falling in love all over again with his wife. Believe me, all the women watching this film will half fall in love with him. All women should be so lucky to have a husband as caring and sensitive as this one seems to be.This is definitely a chick flick. The title song ""Forever Love"" is also beautifully sung by Ms. McEntire.",4,POIGNANT AND ROMANTIC FILM...,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,2181,"['saw', 'movie', 'Lifetime', 'cable', 'television', 'network', 'women', 'very', 'romantic', 'though', 'highly', 'improbable', 'film', 'illness', 'young', 'mother', 'wife', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'coma', 'twenty', 'years', 'life', 'husband', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'devoted', 'bringing', 'home', 'hospital', 'when', 'hospital', 'said', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'husband', 'said', 'married', 'better', 'worse', 'ensconced', 'home', 'providing', 'constant', 'care', 'attention.Meanwhile', 'years', 'pass', 'beloved', 'young', 'daughter', 'up', 'Reba', 'always', 'center', 'talk', 'sing', 'movements', 'Every', 'care', 'consideration', 'given', 'sleeping', 'seemingly', 'insentient', 'surroundings', 'best', 'friend', 'looked', 'daughter', 'husband', 'were', 'own', 'When', 'best', 'friend', 'husband', 'husband', 'best', 'friend', 'comfort', 'other', 'Then', 'amazing', 'happens', 'Reba', 'up', 'twenty', 'year', 'coma', 'fights', 'regain', 'life', 'husband', 'daughter', 'best', 'friend.This', 'story', 'struggle', 'couple', 'family', 'regain', 'what', 'been', 'dormant', 'not', 'lost', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'wife', 'mother', 'struggling', 'reclaim', 'life', 'finding', 'world', 'no', 'longer', 'body', 'aged', 'twenty', 'years', 'last', 'saw', 'Ms.', 'McEntire', 'immensely', 'likable', 'persona', 'magnetic', 'personality', 'role.Tim', 'Matheson', 'sensitive', 'moving', 'performance', 'devoted', 'husband', 'who', 'initially', 'conflicted', 'love', 'wife', 'love', 'best', 'friend', 'ultimately', 'only', 'choice', 'could', 'make', 'falling', 'love', 'over', 'again', 'wife', 'Believe', 'women', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'half', 'fall', 'love', 'women', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'lucky', 'have', 'husband', 'caring', 'sensitive', 'one', 'be.This', 'definitely', 'chick', 'flick', 'title', 'song', 'Forever', 'Love', 'also', 'beautifully', 'sung', 'Ms.', 'McEntire']",Forever Love VHS
