788665,A106016KSI0YQ,B0000X2ESS,Jay Dickson,"[16, 22]","In several of the entries in the ""Prime Suspect"" series Helen Mirren, as Detective Chief Inspector (later Superintendant) Jane Tennison and the writing have richly deserved all the accolades that have been heaped upon them over nearly twenty years, but that unfortunately is not the case here. This is the only entry besides the first that was written by the series creator Lynda LaPlante, but the writing is extremely weak. This time, Tennison is trying to uncover the truth about a gay pedophilic ring that involves murder, molestation, and child pornography, and all the gay characters Tennison interviews are either delicate victims or monstrous predators (or both). Everything seems lurid and sensationalistic. The director, David Drury, made the ghastly  choice to have a boy's choir pipe in incessantly every time Tennison's detectives come across one of the young street hustlers, as if we might forget that innocence has been corrupted. We are also treated to such cliches as fluttery drag queens and menacing AIDS-infected children who inflict deadly bites on the detectives; and it's no good excusing all this by chalking it up to the attitudes of the times, because by 1994 LaPlante truly should have known better. The stereotyping of gay characters is so excessive that in the first episode I knew that there'd have to be at least one suicide attempt among the gay characters: there are no less than three of these, and since two of them seem wildly telegraphed ahead of time in Tennison's immediate proximity she seems like a terrible detective. And she doesn't seem much better as a boss, either, this time around. Usually Tennison must contend with both superiors and subordinates constantly undermining her authority because of her gender, but though her superiors are genuinely out to get her again, here Tennison's underlings seem to be doing the best they can, even though they're constantly being barked at by her for everything imaginable. If you hadn't seen the previous entrants in the series, you'd just think she were just an unpleasant crank.Mirren, normally an unimpeachable actress,  seems to have been done no favors by Drury who allows her to engage in all kinds of distracting bits of ""business,"" like chomping away at her nicotine gum like a house afire to show her distraction and anxiety. David Thewlis, who is also equally talented, also gives a performance that is all tics as the nasty street hustler who is Tennison's prime suspect in the murder of an underage rent boy, and purses his lips over and over again when being interviewed by Tennison and her staff. It's impossible to believe that either he or Ciaran Hinds (here, flat and dull) could deliver any of the menace or charisma needed to keep so many young victims in line. The other actors fare much better, particularly James Frain as a sweet-sad molestation victim and Peter Capaldi as a nervous drag queen. They, and the machinery of the plot, are really all that keeps this production afloat.",2,Dealing in stereotypes,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,2993,"['several', 'entries', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'series', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'later', 'Superintendant', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'writing', 'have', 'richly', 'deserved', 'accolades', 'have', 'been', 'heaped', 'over', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'only', 'entry', 'first', 'was', 'written', 'series', 'creator', 'Lynda', 'LaPlante', 'writing', 'extremely', 'weak', 'time', 'Tennison', 'trying', 'uncover', 'truth', 'gay', 'pedophilic', 'ring', 'murder', 'molestation', 'child', 'pornography', 'gay', 'characters', 'Tennison', 'interviews', 'are', 'delicate', 'victims', 'monstrous', 'predators', 'Everything', 'lurid', 'sensationalistic', 'director', 'David', 'Drury', 'made', 'ghastly', 'choice', 'have', 'boy', 'choir', 'pipe', 'incessantly', 'time', 'Tennison', 'detectives', 'come', 'one', 'young', 'street', 'hustlers', 'might', 'forget', 'innocence', 'been', 'corrupted', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'such', 'cliches', 'fluttery', 'drag', 'queens', 'menacing', 'AIDS-infected', 'children', 'who', 'inflict', 'deadly', 'bites', 'detectives', 'good', 'excusing', 'chalking', 'attitudes', 'times', '1994', 'LaPlante', 'truly', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'stereotyping', 'gay', 'characters', 'so', 'excessive', 'first', 'episode', 'knew', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'least', 'one', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'gay', 'characters', 'are', 'less', 'three', 'two', 'seem', 'wildly', 'telegraphed', 'ahead', 'time', 'Tennison', 'immediate', 'proximity', 'terrible', 'detective', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'better', 'boss', 'either', 'time', 'around', 'Usually', 'Tennison', 'must', 'contend', 'superiors', 'subordinates', 'constantly', 'undermining', 'authority', 'gender', 'superiors', 'are', 'genuinely', 'get', 'again', 'here', 'Tennison', 'underlings', 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'even', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'being', 'barked', 'everything', 'imaginable', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'previous', 'entrants', 'series', ""'d"", 'just', 'think', 'were', 'just', 'unpleasant', 'crank.Mirren', 'normally', 'unimpeachable', 'actress', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'favors', 'Drury', 'who', 'engage', 'kinds', 'distracting', 'bits', 'business', 'chomping', 'away', 'nicotine', 'gum', 'house', 'afire', 'show', 'distraction', 'anxiety', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'who', 'also', 'equally', 'talented', 'also', 'performance', 'tics', 'nasty', 'street', 'hustler', 'who', 'Tennison', 'prime', 'suspect', 'murder', 'underage', 'rent', 'boy', 'lips', 'over', 'again', 'when', 'being', 'interviewed', 'Tennison', 'staff', 'impossible', 'believe', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'here', 'flat', 'dull', 'could', 'deliver', 'menace', 'charisma', 'needed', 'keep', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'victims', 'line', 'other', 'actors', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'particularly', 'James', 'Frain', 'sweet-sad', 'molestation', 'victim', 'Peter', 'Capaldi', 'nervous', 'drag', 'queen', 'machinery', 'plot', 'are', 'really', 'production', 'afloat']",N/A

I watched Prime Suspect 3 years ago, and I thought it was a terrific police drama with an intricate plot and as always a commanding performance by Helen Mirren and the supporting cast.But I don't think I will watch it again for decades because the subject matter is so profoundly ugly.  In a nutshell, DCI Jane Tennison investigates a horrific murder of a ""rent boy"" (underage male prostitute) who is found burned to death.  In her inquiry into this sordid world, Tennison finds evidence of something even worse than this sort of human trafficking...a secret ring of pedophiles preying on young runaways.There is nothing particularly graphic visually, but the subject matter is something that I think most people would find profoundly unsettling.  I'm not condemning the makers of this Prime Suspect installment because police officers like the fictional DCI Tennison sometimes have to walk in the sewers of society and see all the ugliness that is down there.  For being willing to do that and keeping the sewers from overflowing into ""decent"" society, I salute them.I just think that this particular story makes me think of a Russian poet who liked to write beautiful poetry about profoundly ugly and disturbing topics.  He called it, ""plucking the flowers of evil.""  I think that this Prime Suspect story is an example of that...a terrific story with great acting about criminal behavior and human conduct that is sickening to put it mildly.So if you aren't easily haunted by disturbing ideas and the grimmest facts of life, you will find this a great police procedural.  I just know that I won't be watching it again for a long, long, long time ... if ever.",5,"A terrific, haunting, and EXTREMELY dark story",1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,1722,"['probably', 'most', 'unusual', 'review', 'will', 'ever', 'write', 'watched', 'Prime', 'Suspect', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'was', 'terrific', 'police', 'drama', 'intricate', 'plot', 'always', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'supporting', 'cast.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'decades', 'subject', 'matter', 'so', 'profoundly', 'ugly', 'nutshell', 'DCI', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'horrific', 'murder', 'rent', 'boy', 'underage', 'male', 'prostitute', 'who', 'found', 'burned', 'death', 'inquiry', 'sordid', 'world', 'Tennison', 'evidence', 'something', 'even', 'worse', 'sort', 'human', 'trafficking', 'secret', 'ring', 'pedophiles', 'preying', 'young', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'graphic', 'visually', 'subject', 'matter', 'something', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'profoundly', 'unsettling', ""'m"", 'not', 'condemning', 'makers', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'installment', 'police', 'officers', 'fictional', 'DCI', 'Tennison', 'sometimes', 'have', 'walk', 'sewers', 'society', 'see', 'ugliness', 'down', 'there', 'being', 'willing', 'do', 'keeping', 'sewers', 'overflowing', 'decent', 'society', 'salute', 'them.I', 'just', 'think', 'particular', 'story', 'think', 'Russian', 'poet', 'who', 'liked', 'write', 'beautiful', 'poetry', 'profoundly', 'ugly', 'disturbing', 'topics', 'called', 'plucking', 'flowers', 'evil', 'think', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'story', 'example', 'terrific', 'story', 'great', 'acting', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'human', 'conduct', 'sickening', 'put', 'mildly.So', 'are', ""n't"", 'easily', 'haunted', 'disturbing', 'ideas', 'grimmest', 'facts', 'life', 'will', 'find', 'great', 'police', 'procedural', 'just', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'long', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'ever']",N/A

788679,AI0PV0FQLGEAY,B0000X2ESS,Natalie Dressed,"[3, 3]","I have all seven Prime Suspect films in their HBO-produced DVD release, which replicates the original UK broadcast language and technical quality. (Yay!) Why? I consider this series to be on the same plane as The Sopranos in quality, style and substance. It gets brought out regularly for viewing because of the compelling story lines, intriguing characters, fine ensemble acting, and Helen Mirren's multi-layered development of her character, DCI (later Detective Superintendant) Jane Tennison, as she matures during her long career.Full disclosure: I too was a female who worked hard and struggled for decades to be promoted within a traditionally male profession, long before women became accepted and respected members. So, Jane's professional competence and occasional brilliance, workplace struggles and personal failings resonate with me.IMO Prime Suspect 3 is the best but most disturbing film in the series. It's not for everyone. This is the very dark and graphic depiction of the abuse of disturbed and homeless boys by pedophiles who have operated unchecked for years, and of one underage male prostitute's murder that threatens to expose the coverup of some high-ranking officers' complicity and crimes. Tennison's dogged pursuit of Connie's killer is the only uplifting thing about this sordid subject.What truly distinguishes PS3 is a plethora of brilliant and unusual guest star turns. In particular: Peter Capaldi as an empathetic gay drag queen; Ciaran Hinds as an oily operator of boys shelters; David Thewlis as a savage prostitution ring recruiter; and Tom Bell as an old-school detective and Tennison's one-time nemesis. IMO the casting directors for this entire series were geniuses, but they outdid themselves in this episode.In my view, PS3 may be too rough an introduction for the first-time viewer of Prime Suspect, but the entire series should not be missed by people who enjoy watching intelligent crime/action programs. I also think that like The Sopranos, Prime Suspect episodes are best appreciated when seen in chronological order. So is Ms. Mirren's work as Jane Tennison.
