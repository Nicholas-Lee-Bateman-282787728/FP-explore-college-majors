1121726,A3CRNB557EW50L,B000ZBEOG0,"KCWANGSVICK ""Bored with Today's TV""","[0, 0]",Sometimes Hallmark Channel movies are odd (odd like most Lifetime movies are). This movie is a romantic comedy which deals with the issue of organ donor/recipients and has moments of dark comedy among a group of patients waiting for their name to come up on 'the list' for transplant. The main story line however is the issue of whether or not organ-memory exists.  On recipient gets cravings for foods she never liked but the donor did. The two main characters receive the hearts of a husband and wife and are both drawn to the surviving daughter. It is an interesting movie with a happy ending (unlike most Lifetime movies). I bought this DVD after seeing the movie a few times. I can watch this movies several times a year. It's a feel good movie,5,Odd Warm Movie,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,749,"['Sometimes', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'movies', 'are', 'odd', 'odd', 'most', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'are', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'issue', 'organ', 'donor/recipients', 'moments', 'dark', 'comedy', 'group', 'patients', 'waiting', 'name', 'come', 'up', ""'the"", 'list', 'transplant', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'however', 'issue', 'not', 'organ-memory', 'exists', 'recipient', 'cravings', 'foods', 'never', 'liked', 'donor', 'did', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'receive', 'hearts', 'husband', 'wife', 'are', 'drawn', 'surviving', 'daughter', 'interesting', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'most', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'bought', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'can', 'watch', 'movies', 'several', 'times', 'year', 'feel', 'good', 'movie']",A Stranger's Heart

Callie and Jasper have heart tranplants. Their heart donors were Sarah ""Cricket"" Cummings's parents. Callie and Jasper's romance is typical. What's bizarre, is the way these heart transplant people feel so very connected to their donors. I don't know if that's true. But the way they acted towards their donors was like a stalkers. I liked this for Samantha Mathis. She did a pretty good job in being a skeptic and emotionally distant person. Peter comes across as someone who should be an extra in the movies Greece. I did a search on what other acting he's done. Ironically, he's performed as Elvis in Forest Gump and Protecting the King (2007).The movie is still a good chick flick movie to watch on tv.

It is human nature to root for what is ""meant to be,"" and this movie allows you to do that without disappointment.While some consider it to be far-fetched for two people who receive transplants from a husband and wife to fall in love and eventually connect with the deceased couple's orphan, such emotional changes and attractions do happen in transplant patients. Despite the fact that - in typical Hallmark fashion - you can predict at the beginning who is going to fall in love with whom, and that the little girl is going to eventually be in the mix, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch.Everyone in my crowd enjoyed the movie, and one wants to watch it again.",5,We all liked it.,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,730,"['couple', 'tragic', 'moments', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'human', 'nature', 'root', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'movie', 'do', 'disappointment.While', 'consider', 'be', 'far-fetched', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'receive', 'transplants', 'husband', 'wife', 'fall', 'love', 'eventually', 'connect', 'deceased', 'couple', 'orphan', 'such', 'emotional', 'changes', 'attractions', 'do', 'happen', 'transplant', 'patients', 'fact', 'typical', 'Hallmark', 'fashion', 'can', 'predict', 'beginning', 'who', 'going', 'fall', 'love', 'whom', 'little', 'girl', 'going', 'eventually', 'be', 'mix', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch.Everyone', 'crowd', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'one', 'watch', 'again']",A Stranger's Heart
