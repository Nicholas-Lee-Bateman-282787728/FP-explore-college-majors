I wish the Iceland show had video too, but meh.  What are you gonna do?  Instead it displays still photos like Led Zep's How the West Was Won.

780505,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0000E1WKD,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","Foo Fighters albums a lot of times tend to have good songs mixed in with some blah songs. So a live DVD tends to solve all those problems right? Well not really. After so many shows, you'd think they'd work the crowd and the set a little better but I guess not.The main feature I guess is the show they did in Toronto. I have a couple issues with it: 1) the setlist is too damn small. It's 15 songs. Even U2's Elevation shows have at least 20. Pearl Jam had like 30 or something. Where's I'll Stick Around or Big Me or Walking After You? 2) While he's an awesome drummer and good songwriter and even a capable vocalist, live he kind of needs work. For one thing, he does too many ""ready, ready?! WAAAHHH!! By the 2nd song after you've heard it so many times you're like shut up dude, but it keeps doing it! It practically ruins my favorite part of set opener All My Life when in the studio he carries the last word of the chorus, here he just WAAAHHHH!'s it. And probably my absolute favorite Foo Fighter song Aurora is on here yet he doesn't belt it out like I would on disc. The catchy as hell ""on and on and on and on"" part at the end is so jumpy and full of stops it's hard to get into it.There's also 2 more sets with some acoustic stuff, disappointingly most of it already on the Toronto show. Then there's the audio-only version of the Foo's first time in Reykjavik, Iceland with the music only having being heard while a slideshow is played. First of all, there's no video of it and 2nd of all it's practically the exact same set as Toronto, only adding 2 songs and changing the order a bit. Can't maybe do something else?If you're hardcore into Foos get this but for non-fans, hm, I'd say go for it but don't say I didn't warn ya.",3,3.5; it's not bad but does it ever have issues,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,1739,"['Foo', 'Fighters', 'albums', 'lot', 'times', 'tend', 'have', 'good', 'songs', 'mixed', 'blah', 'songs', 'So', 'live', 'DVD', 'solve', 'problems', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'really', 'so', 'many', 'shows', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'work', 'crowd', 'set', 'little', 'better', 'guess', 'not.The', 'main', 'feature', 'guess', 'show', 'did', 'Toronto', 'have', 'couple', 'issues', '1', 'setlist', 'too', 'damn', 'small', '15', 'songs', 'Even', 'U2', 'Elevation', 'shows', 'have', 'least', '20', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'had', '30', 'something', 'Where', ""'ll"", 'Stick', 'Around', 'Big', 'Me', 'Walking', '2', 'awesome', 'drummer', 'good', 'songwriter', 'even', 'capable', 'vocalist', 'live', 'kind', 'needs', 'work', 'one', 'thing', 'too', 'many', 'ready', 'ready', 'WAAAHHH', '2nd', 'song', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'times', ""'re"", 'shut', 'up', 'dude', 'doing', 'practically', 'favorite', 'part', 'set', 'opener', 'My', 'Life', 'when', 'studio', 'last', 'word', 'chorus', 'here', 'just', 'WAAAHHHH', 'probably', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'Foo', 'Fighter', 'song', 'Aurora', 'here', 'yet', ""n't"", 'belt', 'would', 'disc', 'catchy', 'hell', 'part', 'end', 'so', 'jumpy', 'full', 'stops', 'hard', 'get', 'it.There', 'also', '2', 'more', 'sets', 'acoustic', 'stuff', 'disappointingly', 'most', 'already', 'Toronto', 'show', 'Then', 'audio-only', 'version', 'Foo', 'first', 'time', 'Reykjavik', 'Iceland', 'music', 'only', 'having', 'being', 'heard', 'slideshow', 'played', 'First', 'all', 'video', '2nd', 'practically', 'exact', 'same', 'set', 'Toronto', 'only', 'adding', '2', 'songs', 'changing', 'order', 'bit', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'maybe', 'do', 'something', 'else', ""'re"", 'hardcore', 'Foos', 'get', 'non-fans', 'hm', ""'d"", 'say', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'ya']",Foo Fighters - Everywhere But Home
780506,A2NKVD6GES15LD,B0000E1WKD,Scotty,"[2, 5]","This is a very good DVD, a well-rounded selection from the Foo's first four albums, and the fact that the disc starts right into the concert footage is great.  The music is fantastic and, in particular, Taylor Hawkins on drums is just about perfect.  The only real weakness is, well, Dave Grohl's voice.  Let's just say his voice in studio and on the individual albums is great.  Out of studio and on stage......ummmmmm, not so good.  To listen to him try to belt out 'Aurora' at the Toronto show.....ugh.  Painful stuff.  You could almost believe they pulled some random dude out of the crowd and let him try to sing it.  I love this band, I will always love this band and will buy whatever album they ever put out, but I think I'll pass on the live stuff.",3,music - great ......singing - little flat,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,757,"['very', 'good', 'DVD', 'well-rounded', 'selection', 'Foo', 'first', 'four', 'albums', 'fact', 'disc', 'right', 'concert', 'footage', 'great', 'music', 'fantastic', 'particular', 'Taylor', 'Hawkins', 'drums', 'just', 'perfect', 'only', 'real', 'weakness', 'well', 'Dave', 'Grohl', 'voice', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'voice', 'studio', 'individual', 'albums', 'great', 'studio', 'stage', 'ummmmmm', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'listen', 'try', 'belt', 'out', ""'Aurora"", 'Toronto', 'show', '..ugh', 'Painful', 'stuff', 'could', 'almost', 'believe', 'pulled', 'random', 'dude', 'crowd', 'let', 'try', 'sing', 'love', 'band', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'band', 'will', 'buy', 'album', 'ever', 'put', 'out', 'think', ""'ll"", 'pass', 'live', 'stuff']",Foo Fighters - Everywhere But Home

It's worth the asking price just for the acoustic section alone!The Bad:1. The 5.1 Mix is horrible and make's Dave (Grohl) sound like he's singing in the bath (Stick to the Stereo track)  2. Half of the content is an &quot;audio only&quot; concert which covers nearly all of the same tracks as the video content, which is a disappointment!The Unforgiveable:1. After waiting so long for this DVD, i'm left feeling it could have been so much better  2. It doesn't convey the raw power and joy of seeing the Foos live, due to the soundtrack.These coments may seem harsh, but when you see DVD concerts such as Joe Satriani live in San Francisco, then you know what could have been.",3,Good but missing something special,1069804800,"11 26, 2003",2003,787,"['Good:1', 'Foos', '2', '3', 'Hours', 'Foos', 'Live', '3', 'cheap', 'DVD', 'considering', 'content', '4', 'asking', 'price', 'just', 'acoustic', 'section', 'alone', 'Bad:1', '5.1', 'Mix', 'horrible', 'make', 'Dave', 'Grohl', 'sound', 'singing', 'bath', 'Stick', 'Stereo', 'track', '2', 'Half', 'content', 'quot', 'only', 'quot', 'concert', 'nearly', 'same', 'tracks', 'video', 'content', 'disappointment', 'Unforgiveable:1', 'waiting', 'so', 'long', 'DVD', 'i', ""'m"", 'left', 'feeling', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', '2', ""n't"", 'convey', 'raw', 'power', 'joy', 'seeing', 'Foos', 'live', 'due', 'soundtrack.These', 'coments', 'may', 'seem', 'harsh', 'when', 'see', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'such', 'Joe', 'Satriani', 'live', 'San', 'Francisco', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Foo Fighters - Everywhere But Home

Audio on DC and Slane is awful...it's like someone has turned the volume up to 11 on a bad little boom box.

I was copying the contents of the DVD into iTunes so I could view it on my iPod, and I found and extra section on the disc containing 35 minutes of concert footage in Ireland...Dave's got a button-down green shirt on, and he keeps talking about The Hives in between songs...the footage is not mentioned or listed anywhere on the DVD's menu, and not accessible using a DVD player, or DVD playing software on the computer...it's weird.",4,Could it BE more confusing?
