1022234,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000IONJP6,calvinnme,"[20, 22]","To me this is the season of Law & Order Criminal Intent where the show came into its own. I think this is where the Holmes and Watson-like partnership of Goren and Eames really began to gel.Kathryn Erbe is great as Detective Alexandra Eames, Goren's partner, who is the no-nonsense fact gathering detective, seemingly content to stay out of the limelight. D'Onofrio plays Robert Goren the ""Renaissance Man Detective/Psychologist"" in a way that is not only believable but intriguing. I can't think of another actor who could pull off such a role and not have it come across as somewhat silly, such as when Adam West as Batman used to solve those riddles from the Riddler by making huge nonsensical leaps in logic.Vincent D'Onofrio, however, is quite appealing in the role as the multi-faceted and slightly geeky detective with vague shades of the more obvious sociopathy he confronts in his suspects. Rather than stealing the show by being overly macho like your typical TV cop, D'Onofrio does so by daring to be weird. He allows his geekiness to lull people into a false sense of security and then he pulls off his sneaky magic. He'll pretend to be unfamiliar with what is and is not valid testimony in order to mention inadmissable evidence while on the stand in court, or he'll spill something or knock something over to catch a suspect off guard. He delights in toying with arrogant suspects like a cat with a mouse, but he is careful to be sensitive to old ladies and children. Just as he starts to show the faintest signs of macho behavior, he'll jump up and declare ""I must get to a library before it's too late!""  In fitting with his character, D'Onofrio will take up long blocks of time just thinking, but somehow this does not slow down the pace of the show. That is because of how he manages to turn thinking into a kind of performing in itself. In the midst of the show's action he will pause mid-sentence. He looks around  and wrinkles up his face. We wonder what it is he could possibly be pondering - what is it that he has just noticed that the rest of us have missed? The audience already knows who committed the crime. The fun of it all is watching D'Onofrio figure it all out then use his cunning to prove what he knows.As for individual episodes, ""Anti-Thesis"" was probably the best episode of the season. The one-on-one between Goren and arch-criminal Nicole Wallace is outstanding as she is one of the rare villains to successfully turn the tables on Goren. Nicole shows up again in another excellent episode ""A Person of Interest"", which happens to be the season finale. In it, Detective Goren is accused of instigating the supposed suicide of a murder suspect, but the plot unravels, as many fine CI plots do, to reveal a completely different, more sinister suspect - Nicole. If anything, this episode made me respect Nicole even more, for her calculating and so-far infallible shrewdness, providing the perfect foil for Goren. The look on Goren's face when he first thought that Croyden's death was his fault was very poignant. This is really the only episode in which Goren's confidence in his perceptions is truly shaken, and it's heartbreaking to watch. If Goren is Sherlock Holmes, Nicole is truly his Moriarty.Another great episode that was bizarre even by this series' standards was ""Cold Comfort"". An old senator dies and his son and daughter are fighting over his body. The son wants him buried according to the father's wishes. The daughter wants him cryogenically frozen so they can be together in years to come. So far, so bizarre. She has the legal paperwork, so it looks like she's winning. Unfortunately for her a quick trip to the bathroom results in a knife to the upper thigh and a very bloody death. Then things get complicated. Who did it and why? The answers are convoluted but clever and as usual Goran and Eames unravel the story piece by piece and are led to a powerful man who it seems will stop at nothing for his family. It turns out that the late senator had suffered from early onset Alzheimer's, but miraculously recovered, and the previously mentioned powerful man has a son suffering from the very same disease. The daughter's plans for freezing the senator would have denied the powerful man the ability to carve up the dead senator's brain and have it studied in hopes of finding a cure for his son. It's not a series classic, but it does keep you guessing.In summary, this is probably the best season of Law & Order CI, and I highly recommend it.",5,Everything comes together in this season,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,4504,"['season', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'where', 'show', 'came', 'own', 'think', 'where', 'Holmes', 'Watson-like', 'partnership', 'Goren', 'Eames', 'really', 'began', 'gel.Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'great', 'Detective', 'Alexandra', 'Eames', 'Goren', 'partner', 'who', 'no-nonsense', 'fact', 'gathering', 'detective', 'seemingly', 'content', 'stay', 'limelight', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Robert', 'Goren', 'Renaissance', 'Man', 'Detective/Psychologist', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'believable', 'intriguing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'role', 'not', 'have', 'come', 'somewhat', 'silly', 'such', 'when', 'Adam', 'West', 'Batman', 'used', 'solve', 'riddles', 'Riddler', 'making', 'huge', 'nonsensical', 'leaps', 'logic.Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'however', 'quite', 'appealing', 'role', 'multi-faceted', 'slightly', 'geeky', 'detective', 'vague', 'shades', 'more', 'obvious', 'sociopathy', 'suspects', 'Rather', 'stealing', 'show', 'being', 'overly', 'macho', 'typical', 'TV', 'cop', ""D'Onofrio"", 'so', 'daring', 'be', 'weird', 'geekiness', 'lull', 'people', 'false', 'sense', 'security', 'then', 'sneaky', 'magic', ""'ll"", 'pretend', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'what', 'not', 'valid', 'testimony', 'order', 'mention', 'inadmissable', 'evidence', 'stand', 'court', ""'ll"", 'spill', 'something', 'knock', 'something', 'catch', 'suspect', 'off', 'guard', 'toying', 'arrogant', 'suspects', 'cat', 'mouse', 'careful', 'be', 'sensitive', 'old', 'ladies', 'children', 'Just', 'show', 'faintest', 'signs', 'macho', 'behavior', ""'ll"", 'jump', 'up', 'declare', 'must', 'get', 'library', 'too', 'late', 'fitting', 'character', ""D'Onofrio"", 'will', 'take', 'up', 'long', 'blocks', 'time', 'just', 'thinking', 'somehow', 'not', 'slow', 'down', 'pace', 'show', 'how', 'turn', 'thinking', 'kind', 'performing', 'midst', 'show', 'action', 'will', 'pause', 'mid-sentence', 'up', 'face', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'pondering', 'what', 'just', 'noticed', 'rest', 'have', 'missed', 'audience', 'already', 'who', 'committed', 'crime', 'fun', 'watching', ""D'Onofrio"", 'figure', 'out', 'then', 'use', 'cunning', 'prove', 'what', 'individual', 'episodes', 'Anti-Thesis', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'one-on-one', 'Goren', 'arch-criminal', 'Nicole', 'Wallace', 'outstanding', 'one', 'rare', 'villains', 'successfully', 'turn', 'tables', 'Goren', 'Nicole', 'up', 'again', 'excellent', 'episode', 'A', 'Person', 'Interest', 'be', 'season', 'finale', 'Detective', 'Goren', 'accused', 'instigating', 'supposed', 'suicide', 'murder', 'suspect', 'plot', 'unravels', 'many', 'fine', 'CI', 'plots', 'do', 'reveal', 'completely', 'different', 'more', 'sinister', 'suspect', 'Nicole', 'anything', 'episode', 'made', 'respect', 'Nicole', 'even', 'more', 'calculating', 'so-far', 'infallible', 'shrewdness', 'providing', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Goren', 'look', 'Goren', 'face', 'when', 'first', 'thought', 'Croyden', 'death', 'was', 'fault', 'was', 'very', 'poignant', 'really', 'only', 'episode', 'Goren', 'confidence', 'perceptions', 'truly', 'shaken', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'Goren', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Nicole', 'truly', 'Moriarty.Another', 'great', 'episode', 'was', 'bizarre', 'even', 'series', 'standards', 'was', 'Cold', 'Comfort', 'old', 'senator', 'dies', 'son', 'daughter', 'are', 'fighting', 'body', 'son', 'buried', 'according', 'father', 'wishes', 'daughter', 'cryogenically', 'frozen', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'years', 'come', 'So', 'far', 'bizarre', 'legal', 'paperwork', 'winning', 'Unfortunately', 'quick', 'trip', 'bathroom', 'results', 'knife', 'upper', 'thigh', 'very', 'bloody', 'death', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'complicated', 'Who', 'did', 'why', 'answers', 'are', 'convoluted', 'clever', 'usual', 'Goran', 'Eames', 'unravel', 'story', 'piece', 'piece', 'are', 'led', 'powerful', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'family', 'out', 'late', 'senator', 'had', 'suffered', 'early', 'onset', 'Alzheimer', 'miraculously', 'recovered', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'powerful', 'man', 'son', 'suffering', 'very', 'same', 'disease', 'daughter', 'plans', 'freezing', 'senator', 'would', 'have', 'denied', 'powerful', 'man', 'ability', 'carve', 'up', 'dead', 'senator', 'brain', 'have', 'studied', 'hopes', 'finding', 'cure', 'son', 'not', 'series', 'classic', 'keep', 'guessing.In', 'summary', 'probably', 'best', 'season', 'Law', 'Order', 'CI', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Vincent D'Onofrio is perfectly cast as a Sherlock Holmes-type officer, and he carries the show very well, particularly when he's interrogating potential suspects and he gets the culprit to reveal himself or herself. Kathryn Erbe, Courtney B. Vance & Jamey Sheridan round out the cast, and do fine jobs, but it's clear that this is all about D'Onofrio's well-rounded Robert Goren. He's excellent from start to finish, evoking pain and genuine empathy when he's cornered, either by the villains or by the law. The second season includes deleted scenes, but it also would have been nice to have included commentary explaining why the scenes were cut. My favourite scenes are when Nicole & Robert face off. The acting is just perfect, and the scripts were well-written. Nicole Wallace's final line ""Don't think for one second that this is the end of us, Bobby"" is an enigmatic prelude to more cat-and-mouse intrigue to come.My only minor gripe is that if you're going to put nudity, don't just imply it, SHOW IT.

It's really an amazing aproach towards the resolution of extremely difficult and hard police cases. Vincent D'Onofrio, with the support of his lovely buddy Kathryn Erbe, personifies the modern ""COLUMBO"" in the 2000's, but with a more retrospective and psicological context: flematic, intelligent and enigmatic; force the criminals to make mistakes or tell the complete true by manipulating their pressure points in an suspense atmosphere (helped by music); letting us know, at the same time, the reason why the criminals think as they do and what are the psicological reasons (not just the material reasons) for the assaults, and this is the best asset of T.V. series, IT'S REALLY A LEGACY.But It's really important for me to make an estatement: there are another two series named LAW & ORDER. What a mess! but I'm just want to talk about the subtitled ""Special victims"" that is a kind of a copy with the same format (opening music, text, cuts, etc.) of the authentic LAW & ORDER CRIMINAL INTENT. Obviously the T.V. series is created by the same producer Dick Wolf, But I think is disgusting to see that he's plaguing to himself, and then, WHERE IS THE CREATIVITY? T.V. viewers don't deserv this, but it's a question of taste (Isn't it?)...While another detective T.V. series are focused on HOW the criminals did it (like CSI. And I like it too!), LAW & ORDER CRIMINAL INTENT is focused on WHY they did it, making us watch the erosionated systems where we live: the abundance of psicological disorders, the lack of ethic and moral principles (Someone do something!); and making us reflexionate about the educational needs of our society. But this is all academic...  This second season results very interesting for T.V. viewers following by the same emotional dramatic line of stories and characters in first season with a little differences in the trama and the endings, because the things aren't what they seems to be and the criminals always aren't who you think they are, although the argument of histories signal heavily to these characters, making this DVD package a worthy purchase for our collection.

As a fan of cop shows back to the some of the first on TV, this series ranks in the top 5. Goren is simply incredible and the entire cast was in full stride in Season Two. Great stories, great acting, great television.My gripe with the DVDs is that they began putting a synopsis before each episode along with cast details, etc. You click for the selected episode and you are then presented with all this information before you must click again to actually play the episode. That would be all fine and good - except - the synopsis for several of the episodes are complete spoilers! Just one example would be the season's second episode 'Bright Boy' where they tell you in the synopsis who is responsible for the murders! So, be warned, don't read them if you still want to watch Goren work his magic and still be surprised as it unravels for the perp.The other issue, of course, is that Universal has apparently chosen to drop Law & Order: Criminal Intent from their DVD offerings after three seasons. They are the worst of the worst when it comes to starting a series and then dropping it after a season or two. They've done it to some classic series that deserved much better. Strangely, Universal released Season 3 BEFORE Season 2, so actually this is the last we've heard from Universal on this show. What a pity. 'Law & Order: Criminal Intent' deserved the full treatment.

1022252,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B000IONJP6,Mike,"[0, 0]","I won't repeat what others have poster here since they have astutely summed up the charm and appeal of this show...the coupling of Vincent D'Onofrio's ""Detective Robert Goren"" with Kathryn Erbe's ""Detective Alexandra Eames."" It's one of the most successful and enduring pairings on a show of this kind, which...as we all know...can bore you to tears when the script, premise and cast don't quite gel.For me, D'Onofrio first came into view via his role as ""Private Pyle"" inFull Metal Jacket. Like DeNiro inRaging Bull (Single Disc Edition), D'Onofrio gained 70 pounds (DeNiro gained 60, D'Onofrio broke his record) to play an ""anti-hero,"" a character so flawed and damaged that you want to root for him but you are mesmerized by a stunning performance as he heads for the inevitable downward slope. He was also excellent as Danny Greene's labor racketeer pal John Nardi inKill the Irishman. His nickname ""The Chameleon"" is well-earned...there is no glue holding these varied performances together other than sheer, intense talent.Goren is portrayed with many layers, some of them laced with tension. When he interrogates a suspect, he tends to ""bob and weave"" and tilt his head and lower his voice and go through a series of deliberate mannerisms designed to put the person at ease while keeping them on edge. Sound like an impossible contradiction? If you've seen one episode of the show you know exactly what I am talking about. He seems improbably educated (he knows a little something about everything), which prompted Kathryn Erbe's character to exclaim with exasperation, as Goren referred to the ""Russian notebooks"" of a murdered author, ""Don't tell me you can read Russian TOO!""Which brings us to Kathryn Erbe, whose character is most likely as intense and tightly-would as Goren, but is played with far more ""low, steady simmer"" intensity. Sometimes her participation (quite deceptively) seems like an afterthought, until she lets loose with a zinger that lets you know she is plugged in to the same degree as Goren, perhaps more so. Her sex appeal is part of the whole package, rather than being a callous, calculated ""Charlie's Angels"" kind of ""Charlie said the bank was just robbed, let's put on our bikinis"" kind of ongoing stunt.Under the hood, it's pretty much every ""Law and Order"" or ""CSI"" show you've ever seen, but the chemistry and complexity of the Goren and Eames characters push it into the realm of ""must-see TV.""I have only recently experienced the show via the Ion Network, which has been showing reruns of the core cast featured on this DVD. I don't know anything about the cast additions and subtractions in later seasons, or the up-and-down nature of the show's quality over the years. THIS season is HOT.

Every episode is compelling, and there is none of the heaviness that has dragged down the quality level of some episodes in later seasons.We see Vincent D'Onofrio and Kathryn Erbe at their prime in this second season, attacking the storylines with vigour and enthusiasm. This is the season that cemented Detectives Bobby Goren and Alex Eames as one of the best TV cop partnerships ever.The episodes are all excellent. Particular favourites are 'Best Defense';'The Pilgrim'; 'Con-Text'; 'See Me' and 'Probability'.'Best Defense' has the detectives investigating attempts on the life of one of ADA Ron Carver's colleagues, and as they dig, they discover the man's wife may be looking to upgrade from her 'below-average' prosecutor husband. But as always, nothing is as it seems, and the case takes the detectives into dangerous territory and has them once again butting heads with Carver.'The Pilgrim' has Goren and Eames on the search for a pair of potential suicide bombers, and in a race against time to prevent a massive tragedy.'Con-Text' pits Goren against a young man who has had his mind warped by a self-help guru. And the big question is, did he murder his father and brother on his own, or was he manipulated into it?'See Me' deals with schizophrenics, a subject that is close to home for Goren. Once again, as in the season 1 episode 'The Faithful', we are given a look at Goren's skill in dealing with the mentally ill.'Probability' pits Goren against a wily killer, and puts his skills for picking out obscure patterns to the test like never before.And on top of all the other wonderful episodes in Season 2, this is also the season that introduces Goren's hard-to-kill nemesis, the vicious Nicole Wallace. We first see her in 'Anti-Thesis' (the episode that gives us Goren's much-discussed middle initial 'O', and his date of birth), and again at the end of the season in 'A Person of Interest', where we see Goren being the one who is manipulated for once.Season 2 is by far the best season yet of Criminal Intent, although season 6 is proving to be well worth the wait.",5,The best season of all,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,2199,"['five', 'bit', 'seasons', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'run', 'Season', '2', 'arguably', 'best', 'season', 'episode', 'compelling', 'none', 'heaviness', 'dragged', 'down', 'quality', 'level', 'episodes', 'later', 'seasons.We', 'see', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'prime', 'second', 'season', 'attacking', 'storylines', 'vigour', 'enthusiasm', 'season', 'cemented', 'Detectives', 'Bobby', 'Goren', 'Alex', 'Eames', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'cop', 'partnerships', 'ever.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'excellent', 'Particular', 'favourites', 'are', ""'Best"", 'Defense', 'Pilgrim', ""'Con-Text"", ""'See"", 'Me', ""'Probability"", ""'Best"", 'Defense', 'detectives', 'investigating', 'attempts', 'life', 'one', 'ADA', 'Ron', 'Carver', 'colleagues', 'dig', 'discover', 'man', 'wife', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'upgrade', ""'below-average"", 'prosecutor', 'husband', 'always', 'nothing', 'case', 'detectives', 'dangerous', 'territory', 'once', 'again', 'butting', 'heads', 'Carver', 'Pilgrim', 'Goren', 'Eames', 'search', 'pair', 'potential', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'race', 'time', 'prevent', 'massive', 'tragedy', ""'Con-Text"", 'pits', 'Goren', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'mind', 'warped', 'self-help', 'guru', 'big', 'question', 'did', 'murder', 'father', 'brother', 'own', 'was', 'manipulated', 'Me', 'deals', 'schizophrenics', 'subject', 'close', 'home', 'Goren', 'Once', 'again', 'season', '1', 'episode', ""'The"", 'Faithful', 'are', 'given', 'look', 'Goren', 'skill', 'dealing', 'mentally', ""ill.'Probability"", 'pits', 'Goren', 'wily', 'killer', 'skills', 'picking', 'out', 'obscure', 'patterns', 'test', 'never', 'before.And', 'top', 'other', 'wonderful', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'also', 'season', 'Goren', 'hard-to-kill', 'nemesis', 'vicious', 'Nicole', 'Wallace', 'first', 'see', ""'Anti-Thesis"", 'episode', 'Goren', 'much-discussed', 'middle', 'initial', 'O', 'date', 'birth', 'again', 'end', 'season', 'A', 'Person', 'Interest', 'where', 'see', 'Goren', 'being', 'one', 'who', 'manipulated', 'once.Season', '2', 'far', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'season', '6', 'proving', 'be', 'well', 'wait']",N/A
