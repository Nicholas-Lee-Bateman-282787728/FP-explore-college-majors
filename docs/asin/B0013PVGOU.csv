1144065,A150QZUUQAN21X,B0013PVGOU,Fallout Girl,"[3, 6]","I found this movie to be pretentious, idiotic, and not at all funny. I caught myself wondering what sort of person could actually get intrigued by this. It's not tongue-in-cheek enough to be campy, and it's not subtle enough to be satire. It was impossible for me to suspend my disbelief and swallow the idea that this was happening in a far future devastated by nuclear warfare. I expected that at any given moment the camera would turn and reveal the entire film crew, complete with the director wearing a hawaiian shirt, sitting in his chair under a beach umbrella, and sipping a fancy cocktail. I couldn't care about any of the characters. The beginning animations were interesting enough, but after about 20 minutes it disintegrated towards total boredom. I couldn't last past 45 minutes. A complete waste of time.

1144067,APOUYO1BEPK22,B0013PVGOU,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[3, 5]","In 2077, a child by the name of Tex Kennedy is placed into a bunker, by himself, before the nukes hit that wipe about 98% of the world's population. In 2097, Tex Kennedy, a grown man now, emerges from the bunker with a mission. To help with the ruling of New America. With his trusty dysfunctional robots, he begins his search for the prophesized Benjamin Remington, the man that will be King of New America. Together, they will need to get to a radio tower to help unite the lone survivors of America. But the tower just happens to be in a certain part of America called, The Threshold of Hell. For some reason, the people here were protected by the blast. Some would think it might be magic, or maybe even the work of Satan. With the help of some unlikely friends, such as a Cannibal Sue and Javier Castro, they must get to the tower, before Benjamin's crazy brother, the Jackal.The first time I began to watch this, I stopped probably 10 minutes in. I couldn't stand the coloring, and it just seemed very cheap. Then, thanks to me making myself watch all the movies I own in alphabetical order no matter what, I finally got to see this little gem. I honestly laughed quite a lot. Everyone is pretty funny, but Kevin Wheatley (Tex Kennedy) is very funny with his witty lines. The whole story is great, even though filled with plot holes and goofiness. This is definitely not the best movie ever, but for a B-Movie, that is pretty low budget, it's great. It really is. The characters were funny, and some were almost epic, for a movie like this. Even my friend who I was watching this with, who doesn't care for B movies that much, laughed quite a bit too. He said the movie was `Eh', but he still laughed. Also check out the Outtakes, some funny stuff there to. I liked when Tex and the two robots were running up a sandy hill, and one of the robots trips up the other robot and he hits face first into the sand, making them all trip each other up. I laughed pretty hard at that... hehe.While the movie is low budget, and the story is pretty crazy, the movie was definitely a fun watch. I was definitely surprised. Just make sure you sit through the first 10 or 15 minutes. Give it some patience. Can't wait for the sequel (that they tease you with at the end)!P.S. - My friend and I joked about how it looked like 95% of the movie was filmed in the same spot. Well I guess it was. IMDB says that most of it was filmed on the beaches of Pensacola, Florida.

However, it is the viewers who give cult status, not the makers of the film.20 years after American is destroyed by bombs, people emerge from their shelters. While they were in their shelters they listened to the radio broadcast of one man who proclaimed himself king and his nephew (who is blind) to be his heir. A man named Tex Kennedy (Kevin Wheatley) along with 2 androids (Paul Whitty, Chandler Parker) with no real special effects seek out the nephew, Benjamin (Bill English) to fulfill the prophecy.Meanwhile the lunatic son of the broadcaster with his small band of idiots seek Benjamin to kill him. Along their travels, Tex encounters &#34;Cannibal Sue&#34; whose Christian name is Cannibal Susan (Jamie Bullock) who they take with them, in a cage. The characters all come together at a beach party in Pensacola run by Satan, hence the title of the film.There is blood, killing, language, and very brief nudity. New characters are introduced into the movie as it moves along by use of either flashbacks or a futuristic story teller (Richard Riehle) imitating Masterpiece Theater. At times I thought it was going to be a parody of Hamlet, then a satire of the 1960's, then simply a bad movie. It is not laugh out loud funny, but may make you smile.I would recommend seeing &#34;A Boy and His Dog&#34; before watching this movie.",3,NOT A CULT CLASSIC,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,1437,"['National', 'Lampoon', 'attempted', 'create', 'cult', 'classic', 'using', 'standard', 'formula', 'However', 'viewers', 'who', 'give', 'cult', 'status', 'not', 'makers', 'film.20', 'years', 'American', 'destroyed', 'bombs', 'people', 'emerge', 'shelters', 'were', 'shelters', 'listened', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'proclaimed', 'king', 'nephew', 'who', 'blind', 'be', 'heir', 'man', 'named', 'Tex', 'Kennedy', 'Kevin', 'Wheatley', '2', 'androids', 'Paul', 'Whitty', 'Chandler', 'Parker', 'real', 'special', 'effects', 'seek', 'out', 'nephew', 'Benjamin', 'Bill', 'English', 'fulfill', 'prophecy.Meanwhile', 'lunatic', 'son', 'broadcaster', 'small', 'band', 'idiots', 'seek', 'Benjamin', 'kill', 'travels', 'Tex', '34', 'Cannibal', 'Sue', '34', 'Christian', 'name', 'Cannibal', 'Susan', 'Jamie', 'Bullock', 'who', 'take', 'cage', 'characters', 'come', 'together', 'beach', 'party', 'Pensacola', 'run', 'Satan', 'hence', 'title', 'film.There', 'blood', 'killing', 'language', 'very', 'brief', 'nudity', 'New', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'movie', 'along', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'futuristic', 'story', 'teller', 'Richard', 'Riehle', 'imitating', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'times', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'parody', 'Hamlet', 'then', 'satire', '1960', 'then', 'simply', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'may', 'make', 'smile.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', '34', 'A', 'Boy', 'Dog', '34', 'watching', 'movie']",The Beach Party at the Threshold of Hell
