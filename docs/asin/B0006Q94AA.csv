Although the seasons are short compared to US Shows (This set has 7 episodes), they're enjoyable enough that they're worth it. (Great things come in small packages.) Here's a quick summary of the episodes:1. Jean suspects Lionel is going deaf, but he resists going to the doctor. Meanwhile, Lionel becomes convinced that Jean is having problems with her eyes.2. Jean & Lionel take a parental interest in Harry, Sandy's policeman boyfriend. Yet the affairs of the younger generation seem to diminish in importance when Jean receives a phone message from an old flame.3. Jean undertakes some strategic snooping to discover what the new neighbors are like. How is it they show up at the pub with black eyes?4. The whole gang heads out to the country for the weekend. But road construction is about to throw the travelers for a loop.5. Jean's brother, Stephen, and his wife are expected for another visit. To the Hardcastles' surprise, they arrive via separate modes of transportation to announce that they are having a tiff.6. Jean gets everyone, including Lionel's father and stepmother, to help out with her old-age party at the church hall. Lionel is anxious about the whole idea, especially after being told to watch out for Mrs. Thrupp.7. The Duncans abruptly vacate the dwelling next door, and Judith has the wonderful idea that she and Alistair move in. Lionel has his reservations, but they are nothing compared to the reservations of Judith when Alistair makes a surprising proposal.",5,Wonderful Series,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,1566,"['just', 'fabulously', 'entertaining', 'television', 'series', 'funny', 'sweet', 'seasons', 'are', 'short', 'compared', 'US', 'Shows', 'set', '7', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'enjoyable', 'enough', ""'re"", 'Great', 'things', 'come', 'small', 'packages', 'Here', 'quick', 'summary', 'episodes:1', 'Jean', 'suspects', 'Lionel', 'going', 'deaf', 'going', 'doctor', 'Meanwhile', 'Lionel', 'convinced', 'Jean', 'having', 'problems', 'eyes.2', 'Jean', 'Lionel', 'take', 'parental', 'interest', 'Harry', 'Sandy', 'policeman', 'boyfriend', 'affairs', 'younger', 'generation', 'seem', 'diminish', 'importance', 'when', 'Jean', 'phone', 'message', 'old', 'flame.3', 'Jean', 'strategic', 'snooping', 'discover', 'what', 'new', 'neighbors', 'are', 'How', 'show', 'up', 'pub', 'black', 'eyes', '4', 'whole', 'gang', 'heads', 'out', 'country', 'weekend', 'road', 'construction', 'throw', 'travelers', 'loop.5', 'Jean', 'brother', 'Stephen', 'wife', 'are', 'expected', 'visit', 'Hardcastles', 'surprise', 'arrive', 'separate', 'modes', 'transportation', 'announce', 'are', 'having', 'tiff.6', 'Jean', 'everyone', 'including', 'Lionel', 'father', 'stepmother', 'help', 'out', 'old-age', 'party', 'church', 'hall', 'Lionel', 'anxious', 'whole', 'idea', 'especially', 'being', 'told', 'watch', 'out', 'Mrs.', 'Thrupp.7', 'Duncans', 'abruptly', 'vacate', 'dwelling', 'next', 'door', 'Judith', 'wonderful', 'idea', 'Alistair', 'move', 'Lionel', 'reservations', 'are', 'nothing', 'compared', 'reservations', 'Judith', 'when', 'Alistair', 'surprising', 'proposal']",N/A
