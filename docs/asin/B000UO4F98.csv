Hamil,"[13, 15]","I have had this film on vhs for a long time and am glad to finally get it on dvd.This is William Petersen at his best and has a lot of twists and turns to keep the viewer interested. The film has also been titled "" Deadly Currents "" and "" Curacao "" and also gives George C Scott a role that is different than what he is usually seen doing.This is a film of espionage and yes a little sex is included but don't let that stop you for you will be guessing about all the charactors throughout the film and it does have it's humour as well.",5,LOTS OF THRILLS,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,535,"['have', 'had', 'film', 'vhs', 'long', 'time', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'get', 'dvd.This', 'William', 'Petersen', 'best', 'lot', 'twists', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested', 'film', 'also', 'been', 'titled', 'Deadly', 'Currents', 'Curacao', 'also', 'George', 'C', 'Scott', 'role', 'different', 'what', 'usually', 'seen', 'doing.This', 'film', 'espionage', 'yes', 'little', 'sex', 'included', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'will', 'be', 'guessing', 'charactors', 'film', 'have', 'humour', 'as', 'well']",CIA: Exiled

The actors were likable enough and performed well.  I had never imagined George C. Scott in such a role as the restraunt owner whose past comes back to haunt him.  William Petersen plays an ex-CIA agent who is exiled to Caracau because he took the life of a fellow agent who was a traitor.  In the process of the story, he is laiden with Scott's problems and has to sort them out. Being a hero, he reluctantely does so.  An old flame and CIA agent enters the picture because of his discontent to watch over him.  She winds up protecting him from ""the powers that be.""Like I said it isn't a great movie but if you need some entertainment this might work for you.  Would I recommend it?  I'm still trying to decide.O, this  movie is rated ""R"", but there is very little foul language, one sex scene and one but-shot of Petersen's rear end.  He does have a nice rear end.",3,Not a great movie,1244160000,"06 5, 2009",2009,969,"['like', 'try', 'new', 'movies', 'just', 'something', 'different', 'liked', 'movie', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'actors', 'were', 'likable', 'enough', 'performed', 'well', 'had', 'never', 'imagined', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'such', 'role', 'restraunt', 'owner', 'past', 'back', 'haunt', 'William', 'Petersen', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'exiled', 'Caracau', 'took', 'life', 'fellow', 'agent', 'who', 'was', 'traitor', 'process', 'story', 'laiden', 'Scott', 'problems', 'sort', 'out', 'Being', 'hero', 'reluctantely', 'so', 'old', 'flame', 'CIA', 'agent', 'picture', 'discontent', 'watch', 'up', 'protecting', 'powers', 'be', 'said', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'need', 'entertainment', 'might', 'work', 'Would', 'recommend', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'decide.O', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'very', 'little', 'foul', 'language', 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'one', 'but-shot', 'Petersen', 'rear', 'end', 'have', 'nice', 'rear', 'end']",CIA: Exiled

(Be careful - this film has 2 other titles:  Curacao and Deadly Currents.)  Despite the fact that it has some decent actors involved, this movie just never gets off the ground.  It's so slow it creeps along with an overacting George C. Scott and Dennis Christopher.  The action is minimal but, for those who are interested, there are 2 brief nude scenes of Mr. Petersen that are worthwhile.  Other than that, I it's an okay film but nothing more.",3,SLOW - SLOW - SLOW,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,522,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'William', 'Petersen', 'fan', 'so', 'when', 'found', 'item', 'snapped', 'up', 'Be', 'careful', 'film', '2', 'other', 'titles', 'Curacao', 'Deadly', 'Currents', 'fact', 'decent', 'actors', 'involved', 'movie', 'just', 'never', 'ground', 'so', 'slow', 'along', 'overacting', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Dennis', 'Christopher', 'action', 'minimal', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'are', '2', 'brief', 'nude', 'scenes', 'Mr.', 'Petersen', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'Other', 'okay', 'film', 'nothing', 'more']",CIA: Exiled
