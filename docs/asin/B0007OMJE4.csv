Before this video, I had no idea there were so many different styles of this art form!  Amazing performances and I appreciated the DVD menu so I could view my favorites over and over.  I am now a HUGE fan of all of the performers, but especially of Rachel Brice and Ansuya.  There is true variety that includes tribal, classic, acrobatic, humorous, Bollywood styles with music, sets and costumes that complement.  I am going to play this DVD at my next party to educate friends on the variety in bellydance.",5,Inspiring!

Rachel Brice is a brilliantly skilled yogi. Amar Gamal and Sonia look like bellydancing supermodels. Slender Kaeshi is exquisite, and so feminine. Ample Dondi is juicy, and so feminine. Glamorously mysterious Sharon Kihara blew me away with uniquely beautiful gentle cascading of her belly... It was like surrealistic waterfalls. Adore turned out to be not only a great dancer, but also a proficient gymnast. However, I think she incorporated too many saltos. I was impressed with the endless spinning and double-veiling of Petite Jamilla, but I was partially turned off by that semi-rap music. Jillina didn't appeal to me. I think she is even colder and dryer here than on her instructional videos. There are other dancers in the show, but it is hard to see what they are doing, since they only participate in group performances, and usually in the back.I very much enjoyed nearly every solo. I admired the Bellyqueen duet, probably my favorite number. However, some of the group performances were not very interesting. And I felt that ""Marilyn Monroe"" was such a stretch.I think the second round of dancers' introduction at the end (on the stairs) was needless. The picture quality does get horrible sometimes, but it doesn't happen too often.Even with its imperfections, this is the best performance video I've seen so far.",5,"Diversity, superb professionalism, and beautiful appearances",1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,1432,"['was', 'pleased', 'diversity', 'dancers', 'styles', 'Ansuya', 'exhilarating', 'fountain', 'energy', 'Rachel', 'Brice', 'brilliantly', 'skilled', 'yogi', 'Amar', 'Gamal', 'Sonia', 'look', 'bellydancing', 'supermodels', 'Slender', 'Kaeshi', 'exquisite', 'so', 'feminine', 'Ample', 'Dondi', 'juicy', 'so', 'feminine', 'Glamorously', 'mysterious', 'Sharon', 'Kihara', 'blew', 'away', 'uniquely', 'beautiful', 'gentle', 'cascading', 'belly', 'was', 'surrealistic', 'waterfalls', 'Adore', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'dancer', 'also', 'proficient', 'gymnast', 'However', 'think', 'incorporated', 'too', 'many', 'saltos', 'was', 'impressed', 'endless', 'spinning', 'double-veiling', 'Petite', 'Jamilla', 'was', 'partially', 'turned', 'off', 'semi-rap', 'music', 'Jillina', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'think', 'even', 'colder', 'dryer', 'here', 'instructional', 'videos', 'are', 'other', 'dancers', 'show', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'only', 'participate', 'group', 'performances', 'usually', 'back.I', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'nearly', 'solo', 'admired', 'Bellyqueen', 'duet', 'probably', 'favorite', 'number', 'However', 'group', 'performances', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'felt', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'stretch.I', 'think', 'second', 'round', 'dancers', 'introduction', 'end', 'stairs', 'was', 'needless', 'picture', 'quality', 'get', 'horrible', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'happen', 'too', 'often.Even', 'imperfections', 'best', 'performance', 'video', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far']",N/A

884952,AEV6T72PZFEHX,B0007OMJE4,"Ettell ""ettell""","[5, 5]","I was offered the Belly Dance Superstars DVD and that is how I came to know them. My favourites on that particular DVD were Tamalyn Dallal, Souhaila Salimpour and Rachel Brice. This is what made me go in search of more... and the discovery of the Belly Dance Superstars at the Folies Berg&egrave;res.I hadn't realised that Belly Dance was a big deal in the States and I have to say that a dance troupe touring internationally is an excellent idea (in the documentary on how the group was formed, Miles Copeland did say his intention was to produce something like the Riverdance of Belly Dance - and hopefully have as much success.)For Belly Dance enthusiasts, this show is great because it features several styles of Belly Dance: Egyptian modern, choreographed mainly by Jilina; Tribal Fusion choreographed by Rachel Brice; Cabaret-style as presented by Ansuya; dancing with veils and something that looks like derwishes spinning round and round (Petite Jamila), plus drum solos.My favourites were the Tribal Dances, for the moves, music and costumes and the group Drum sequence featuring 5 dancers, of which my favourites on that set are Sharon Kahira and Petite Jamila.This is definitely a good buy, fun entertainment for adults and children alike. I first watched this DVD at my sister's house. My 4-year old niece would not let me leave with it so the following day, I was back at the store getting a new copy for myself. She spent all summer watching it every chance she got (to the annoyance of her parents, who had had enough of that, I might add.)But there you go - definitely worth buying.

884956,A18AJZ4NYUMFG6,B0007OMJE4,Parthena Black,"[9, 9]","I like this DVD much, much better than the original ""Bellydance Superstars."" I think that the difference in opinion depends on whether you are a dancer or just a fan. I agree that there is a bit too much pink and neon color and that the camera frequently moves away from the move you really want to see, but this is a musical arts performance and not an instructional. Bellydancers are understandably going to be annoyed with the camera work. Perhaps camera technicians filming bellydance performances should be bellydancers so that they might understand what the dancers in the audience are interested in! The camera tech's habit of cutting to the dancer's face isn't all bad, though, because a few nice moments of interaction among the dancers was caught.The dancing is beautiful, the dancers are energetic and the group drum solos with Issam are a lot of fun. I can't find criticism for a single one of the dancers or the choreography. From the amazing Ansuya to the spinning Petite Jamila to the tribal dancers to Dondi's hilarious ""Marilyn,"" the dancing is energetic and flawless. Sonia and Issam do a wonderful job as usual, and two group drum solos are included. In the first, Ansuya gets to show off her solo skills and even Sharon Kihara joins in with full tribal costume. We're also treated to the seductive style of Dondi at her best. In the second one we are treated to Jillina's classic hair tosses when she expands on her performance from the original. That woman is going to have some neck problems.......A great variety of dances is presented, including the beautiful ""Bombay Bellywood,"" which starts on a dark, serious note and ends with a fun Hindi dance. I enjoyed every single performance and will watch this one over and over again.I do wish that the DVD had a menu where you could choose specific performances like the original does. My version doesn't have one and while I can forward the DVD player, I'm not sure which order the performances are in so it's a little inconvenient.If you fail to play the DVD to the very end, you'll miss a unique presentation of the credits with a little twist at the end that will make you smile.

884957,A1H7WEWIRA4TLA,B0007OMJE4,"Rom Deussen ""Rom""","[17, 17]","Dondi, on [...] wrote a review of the Carnivale show that BDSS is now doing, and I must admit it also corresponds to the Folies show.I am a Middle Eastern Dancer, but a classical Indian dancer as well, and while I like Jillina's work on the whole, I was disappointed in the choreography of the Bollywood pieces.  A huge part of Bollywood are gentle smiles and the eyes, both of which are lacking here, along with the arm precision.I liked the introduction at the dancers at the end, but ATS dancers are just as feminine--yet walked down alone like Amazon warriors.  I really wasn't sure if this was a planned portrayal or Miles' idea, but it just seemed like they were saying ATS dancers are not as graceful as the ladies in the glitter.  And while I am a fan of Rachel's, her falling down the steps was, as another reviewer put it, clownish and forced.I liked the addition of Adore and Petite Jamilla, but do feel this is a leaning trend of BDSS becoming more showy and less technique oriented.The cinematography is only somewhat decent-the film is very red in parts, and pale in others, and doesn't seem to capture their presence very well.  Also, several times the dancer's names don't match up to the actual dancer.The dancing, Bollywood piece aside, is stellar, even for performers I will honestly admit I don't care for.  I am not an Adore fan, but do appreciate her strength and agility, and feel she is a strong dancer.  I am not a BellyQueen advocate but they work so well as a team and I love how they show two completely different body types working together beautifully.  Every performance had merit, the Desert Roses, while their smiles fade at times, are well rehearsed, and Issam is always a fun addition.I do also like the spartan stage for it does not detract from the dancers, much like the original BDSS video does with its computer-added background.Do I own this? Yes. Was it worth the price? Yes.  Could it have been better? Yes.  But for those who have never been exposed to the world of Middle Eastern dance, it's a solid round exposure.  For us ""old timers,"" it shows interesting choreography and a wide range of performances not available elsewhere.
