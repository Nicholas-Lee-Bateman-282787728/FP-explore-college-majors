910112,A23V875B0Q9HT7,B0009PLLN6,Agustin Guerrero,"[4, 8]","Being a fan of history based movies and especially the ancient history period pieces and after being dissapointed by the gross historical errors and lack of accuracy in details in blockbusters such as Gladiator, 300, Spartacus among other movies I believe Alexander is one of the better movies in terms of details and historical accuracy.Many critics have rated Alexander negatively taking for example the battle scenes as messy and hard to follow but I believe the depiction of Gaugamela is true to history, we see Alexanders move to the flanks until he opens a breach in the Persian line which he uses to charge directly against Darius, we see the sarissa phalanx repelling the chariot attacks, all of this amid the chaos and dust of the battlefield which is a more accurate description than most Hollywood battle recreations that lack that sense of chaos and drama.There are some exagerations such as the depiction of Babylon that should have been an impressive city for ancient standards but in this movie it looks like Manhattan but the architechture is mostly accurate, showing the zigurats and canals but omiting the dirt and grime that should have been in a colossal scale.We are presented with an accurate description of the battle of Hydaspes in India where the scene of Alexander riding in Bucephalus charging the elephant is worth the admission price.Details such as clothing, armor, the looks of the people are kept true to history and I believe the producers made a very thorough research into this area which is commendable.There are some critics that condemn the homosexual tones of Alexander and Hephaestion's friendship but in ancient times homosexual relations were not shunned and in societies such as Sparta they were encouraged, remember the Sacred Band in Thebes which was formed of couples of homosexual lovers.  Modern greeks were the most vocal in the condemnation of this side of Alexander's character as depicted in the movie but they neglect some truths in their history and homosexual relationships did not carry the stigma of modern times, warriors seek the company of other warriors in the loneliness of campaigns and from great frisendships great romances could flourish.  If Alexander was indeed a homosexual will it diminish the greatness o his military conquests?  I believe not.Other beautiful details are the great scenery especially when crossing the Pamir range in Afghanistan, Bucephalus could not have been better depicted as a magnificent beast, beautiful actresses such as Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson complemet an amazing cast, plus the outstanding soundtrack by Vangelis, make this movie a pleasue to watch.Maybe Colin Farrel was miscast as Alexander and the job could be handled better by Heath Ledger or Leonardo Di Caprio who are natural blondes but I believe Farrel handled the character well enough and I could appreciate his great effort in portraying Alexander being of note his outstanding delivery of the battle speech at Gaugamela, maybe he was a little solemn and wooden but it didn't detract from the whole effect of the movie.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I still cannot understand why it got such low rating by critics who in turn gave rave reviews to Gladiator (best movie of 2000) and 300 which were fundamentally flawed at depicting history, in comparisson this is a much better movie and I sincerely recomend it.",5,The Best Sword and Sandals of Them All,1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,3387,"['Being', 'fan', 'history', 'based', 'movies', 'especially', 'ancient', 'history', 'period', 'pieces', 'being', 'dissapointed', 'gross', 'historical', 'errors', 'lack', 'accuracy', 'details', 'blockbusters', 'such', 'Gladiator', '300', 'Spartacus', 'other', 'movies', 'believe', 'Alexander', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'terms', 'details', 'historical', 'accuracy.Many', 'critics', 'have', 'rated', 'Alexander', 'negatively', 'taking', 'example', 'battle', 'messy', 'hard', 'follow', 'believe', 'depiction', 'Gaugamela', 'true', 'history', 'see', 'Alexanders', 'move', 'flanks', 'breach', 'Persian', 'line', 'charge', 'directly', 'Darius', 'see', 'sarissa', 'phalanx', 'repelling', 'chariot', 'attacks', 'chaos', 'dust', 'battlefield', 'more', 'accurate', 'description', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'battle', 'recreations', 'lack', 'sense', 'chaos', 'drama.There', 'are', 'exagerations', 'such', 'depiction', 'Babylon', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'impressive', 'city', 'ancient', 'standards', 'movie', 'Manhattan', 'architechture', 'mostly', 'accurate', 'showing', 'zigurats', 'canals', 'omiting', 'dirt', 'grime', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'colossal', 'scale.We', 'are', 'presented', 'accurate', 'description', 'battle', 'Hydaspes', 'India', 'where', 'scene', 'Alexander', 'riding', 'Bucephalus', 'charging', 'elephant', 'admission', 'price.Details', 'such', 'clothing', 'armor', 'looks', 'people', 'are', 'kept', 'true', 'history', 'believe', 'producers', 'made', 'very', 'thorough', 'research', 'area', 'are', 'critics', 'condemn', 'homosexual', 'tones', 'Alexander', 'Hephaestion', 'friendship', 'ancient', 'times', 'homosexual', 'relations', 'were', 'not', 'shunned', 'societies', 'such', 'Sparta', 'were', 'encouraged', 'remember', 'Sacred', 'Band', 'Thebes', 'was', 'formed', 'couples', 'homosexual', 'lovers', 'Modern', 'greeks', 'were', 'most', 'vocal', 'condemnation', 'side', 'Alexander', 'character', 'depicted', 'movie', 'neglect', 'truths', 'history', 'homosexual', 'relationships', 'did', 'not', 'carry', 'stigma', 'modern', 'times', 'warriors', 'seek', 'company', 'other', 'warriors', 'loneliness', 'campaigns', 'great', 'frisendships', 'great', 'romances', 'could', 'flourish', 'Alexander', 'was', 'indeed', 'homosexual', 'will', 'diminish', 'greatness', 'military', 'conquests', 'believe', 'not.Other', 'beautiful', 'details', 'are', 'great', 'scenery', 'especially', 'when', 'crossing', 'Pamir', 'range', 'Afghanistan', 'Bucephalus', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'depicted', 'magnificent', 'beast', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'such', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'complemet', 'amazing', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'soundtrack', 'Vangelis', 'make', 'movie', 'pleasue', 'watch.Maybe', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'was', 'miscast', 'Alexander', 'job', 'could', 'be', 'handled', 'better', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'who', 'are', 'natural', 'blondes', 'believe', 'Farrel', 'handled', 'character', 'well', 'enough', 'could', 'appreciate', 'great', 'effort', 'portraying', 'Alexander', 'being', 'note', 'outstanding', 'delivery', 'battle', 'speech', 'Gaugamela', 'maybe', 'was', 'little', 'solemn', 'wooden', 'did', ""n't"", 'detract', 'whole', 'effect', 'movie.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'got', 'such', 'low', 'rating', 'critics', 'who', 'turn', 'gave', 'rave', 'reviews', 'Gladiator', 'best', 'movie', '2000', '300', 'were', 'fundamentally', 'flawed', 'depicting', 'history', 'comparisson', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'sincerely', 'recomend']",Alexander
910113,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0009PLLN6,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[13, 21]","At a cost of over $ 150,000,000 to make, and overtaken at the box office by the ""SpongeBob"" movie, ""Alexander"" is the 21st century ""Heaven's Gate."" The participants in this epic disaster should hope that few people see this film, because like ""Heaven's Gate"" in 1981, this could be a career-breaker. Oliver Stone's direction, working with a weak and often preposterous script, is a major catastrophe. The only scene that works in the entire 3 hours of this film is when the young Alexander (Connor Paolo, the only cast member whose reputation as an actor remains untarnished) tames the wild horse Bucephalus.As Alexander, Colin Farrell is hopeless. Instead of having a commanding presence, as one would assume Alexander had to have, he is feeble and gives us a ""smaller than life"" hero, a puppy dog in need of his lover Haphastion (Jared Leno in heavy eye makeup). He also not only has a thick Irish accent, but very poor diction. An actor getting major roles should be skilled enough to remove regional traces from his speaking voice, and be able to acquire a ""non-accent.""Another vocal treasure is Angelina Jolie, who pouts and plays with her pet snake collection, and sounds exactly like Lotte Lenya in ""From Russia with Love."" If this film makes a dent in the Hollywood history books, it will be for this bizarre characterization of Olympias. What was Jolie thinking, and why did Stone allow it?The quasi-historical epic of heroism and adventure is my favorite genre, and I wanted to enjoy this film, but was almost repulsed by it. If you want to see a towering failure, this is it. Filmed in Morocco, there are miles of rusty colored desert, and the landscape was much better served in the made for TV Bible films. The soundtrack by Vangelis is also unsuccessful, and in many scenes seems to be out-of-synch with the action on the screen. This ranks as one of the worst films I have ever seen, reminding me a little of Bob Guccione's ""Caligula,"" except the actors are wearing clothes. Arf!

Unfortunately we've yet to find a movie that can match his greatness.This movie tries, and in some measures it does succeed, like in the sets, costumes and some battle scenes, but the dialogue is sometimes a bit silly and sometimes the best dialogue went to supporting characters and not the main ones. I would never have cast Colon Farrell as Alexander. He tried, I think, but couldn't pull off what was needed to bring him to life. I prefered to watch Gary Stretch as Cleitus or Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Cassander before Colin. They weren't even that overly important to the story.I understood the reason for the accents, but for some, they just couldn't pull them off.

The movie starts out OK, but it then starts exploring Alexander's sexual affairs with a Persian enuch and how his love life affected his dicisions. People much rather expected to see more suspense, strong line exchanges between the actors, and less of Alexander's relationship with that enuch. I don't think his affair was even relevant to history. People who see historical epics are usually intelligent and knowledgable people or either deep thinkers who expect more from a historical epic. The costumes and sets were great, but the director didnt even bother to get his facts straight anout the little details like the Persian wedding (which is much more elaborate) the Greek and Persian war techniques which were much more sophisticated, and the conversations between the enemies. He didnt even get the costumes right despite their beauty. Persian war attire was very different. Instead you get to see ""the sexual life"" of Alexander which has no relevance to what he accomplished nor was it a relavant historical point. I could go on and on but I think you get my picture.

910117,A1TD9JUXG1DGW3,B0009PLLN6,"Allie Kat ""sarahphin""","[3, 7]","I thought this thing might be mildly entertaining to me given the number of people I've known who claimed to be Alexander reincarnated. The character has never interested me, I can't find much that's compelling behind that whole `see, want, trample, grab' greedy tot thing; still, one would think that knowing the main character personally, so to speak and with tongue tucked firmly in cheek, would be reason enough to sit still and watch a movie without falling asleep. And, I suppose, even megalomaniacs must have personalities. Unfortunately, apparently Oliver Stone couldn't find much of interest either, apart from pointing out Alexander's homosexual attachments and thus, rather than remembering that wasn't unusual for the time and place, drawing the unfortunate conclusion that the lad must also be a sissy crybaby unable to demand respect from his troops. It's all one big, illogical mess.It's difficult to see how this Alexander would have made it across a meadow let alone the battlefields of an unconquered world. While I'm reasonably sure I would have detested Alexander as much as I detest Hitler and Stalin, I'm also sure that if he didn't have an interesting war story or two to tell, then who would? And despite being a girl, I don't mind watching a good fight. The battles here are the poorest depictions I've ever seen. I know they would have been chaotic but surely directors have the sense to not put lengthy passages of meaningless chaos on the screen. Similarly, Ptolemy should be a fascinating chap to chat with over tea, but if he droned on and on as he did in the opening I'd poison the tea. His or mine, no matter. It's an endless banquet of embarrassments, really. I love Colin Farrell but his golden-headed cherub of an Alexander belongs on a Carnival float. I love Angelina Jolie but casting her in a matronly role is absurd, and what was that accent - Ukrainian? Czarist Russian? Greek? Ah, yes, eastern Europe via Hollywood.

This film is really a history buff's kind of movie. Yes, it has action, big names (Farrell, Jolie, Hopkins, and Kilmer) and is based on a lot of historical fact.  I think the homosexual relationships and the movies length and pacing are what killed it at the theater, which is what I have gathered from others when I have asked them about what they thought of it.Personally, I have no problem with the relationships described in this film as it is pretty much a fact that all Greek men had male lovers back in the day.  This movie was paced for Hollywood in the original cut (some suit did that) and cut to make it more audience friendly.  The ensuing original product just felt rushed to me and I waited to watch this version; I was not disappointed by the story on either version but it was a better experience with the edit.This version is put together entirely different and I think it is a better story and version of the film. The battle scenes are extended and there is a lot more character development. Kingdom of Heaven's re-cut and re-release is a better film than this one but this is very good and worth obtaining.The Blu-ray transfer is very good......picture quality wise but the sound could be better. Overall, I would give this movie 4/5 because of the sound quality.  Dolby on a BD is good for a DVD but for being on BD there was a lot of GB space wasted on this film especially since you have to change disks to watch the whole movie.I am still at a loss as to why you have to do this because of the storage capacity of BD but hey what do I know?-fin",4,Ridley Scott is a great Director.......this is a good film,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,1646,"['Alexander', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'film', 'really', 'history', 'buff', 'kind', 'movie', 'Yes', 'action', 'big', 'names', 'Farrell', 'Jolie', 'Hopkins', 'Kilmer', 'based', 'lot', 'historical', 'fact', 'think', 'homosexual', 'relationships', 'movies', 'length', 'pacing', 'are', 'what', 'killed', 'theater', 'what', 'have', 'gathered', 'others', 'when', 'have', 'asked', 'what', 'thought', 'it.Personally', 'have', 'problem', 'relationships', 'described', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'fact', 'Greek', 'men', 'had', 'male', 'lovers', 'back', 'day', 'movie', 'was', 'paced', 'Hollywood', 'original', 'cut', 'suit', 'did', 'cut', 'make', 'more', 'audience', 'friendly', 'ensuing', 'original', 'product', 'just', 'felt', 'rushed', 'waited', 'watch', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'story', 'version', 'was', 'better', 'experience', 'edit.This', 'version', 'put', 'together', 'entirely', 'different', 'think', 'better', 'story', 'version', 'film', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'extended', 'lot', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 're-cut', 're-release', 'better', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'worth', 'obtaining.The', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'wise', 'sound', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'Overall', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '4/5', 'sound', 'quality', 'Dolby', 'BD', 'good', 'DVD', 'being', 'BD', 'was', 'lot', 'GB', 'space', 'wasted', 'film', 'especially', 'have', 'change', 'disks', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie.I', 'am', 'still', 'loss', 'why', 'have', 'do', 'storage', 'capacity', 'BD', 'hey', 'what', 'do', 'know', '-fin']",Alexander

And, 2) the directors failure to create a lead character (Alexander) that I could symphasize with.

To call this movie the ""Battlefield Earth"" of historical epics would be an insult to ""Battlefield Earth"", because THAT movie was at least entertaining in its awfulness.So, what's wrong with Alexander?  Gee, where do I begin?  How about the non-linear story line which in no way hightens the drama, and only serves to confuse the viewer.  How about the battle scenes?  There are two major ones.  The first one is so confusing that I had no idea that Alexander's army had won until Anthony Hopkins' narraration told me they did.  The second battle was in India and involved elephants.  While watching this sequence, I couldn't help but be reminded of ""Return of the King"", and I wished I was watching that movie instead.Did Oliver Stone really make this travesty?  This is the same guy who directed ""Platoon"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July""?  I can't believe it.  I watched the director's cut.  If this is the ""new and improved version"", I can only imagine how bad the theatrical version must be.  Thankfully, I'll never know.Be warned.  This movie clocks in at nearly 3 hours.

910126,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B0009PLLN6,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[22, 23]","I was impressed when I first saw Alexander on the screen.  This was before I was obsessed with ancient Greek and Roman history.  Then re-seeing it, I fell in love with it, original theatrical cut.  The Director's cut was okay, but not better than the original.I recently recognized the flaws which detracted some people from it, such as lack of characterization of some of the minor characters, a seeming characterization of Alexander based on his flaws rather than his greatness, and so on.  However, I don't think this is enough to detract my intense love for the movie.I think Oliver Stone is a cinematic genius, and it shows in his work like Platoon and Natural Born Killers.  The direction is brilliant, and the incredible detail put into cinematography, costumes, and sets is simply epic on its own scale.The Battle of Gaugamela sequence is pure brilliance, and I believe the most accurate ancient battle portrayal in all Hollywood.  Aside from occasional lapses in which a Phalanx is broken apart, men fight in formation, rather than wandering around the field on their own, picking on-on-one ""The Mummy Returns"" style battles.The acting is perhaps some of the best I've ever seen.  Colin Farrel dissolves so fully into his role, that it's impossible for me to see the man playing Alexander as the man who played a slick New York agent in ""Phone Booth"", or a deadpan bald villain with a raspy voice in ""Daredevil"".  Val Kilmer so fully becomes Philip of Macedon that you can't see him doing any other role.  He's no longer Val Kilmer underneath the scarred eyelid and thick beard, he's Philippos II of Makedon.The lesser-known actors, Jared Leto who plays Hephaistion, Gary Stretch who plays Cleitus the Black, and all the others playing the likes of Crateros, young Ptolemaios, Nearkhos, they are so fluid in their roles that they could quite possibly be the actual characters they portray, Irish and British accents and all.The ""Clash with Cleitus"" scene is so thickly potent with chemistry between Farrel and Stretch (Cleitus) that it sends shivers through my spine listening to how these two rail at each other, and how literate, yet scathing and understandable Cleitus is.  His vocabulary is like poetry, like Sophokles' writing, and yet his message is so simple and human that it's universally understood, even if you don't speak the language.Inaccuracies aside (they had to cut and condense scenes for time, including a simplification of the Battle of Hydaspes, which Stone himself acknowledges, due to the vast complexity of the actual battle), it's one of the more accurate Hollywood movies about Ancient Greece, and an epic in its own right.  Love it or hate it, it IS an epic.The Final Cut expands upon it even more, and re-arranges scenes so that the lead-up to the Battle of Gaugamela comes first, after the scene of his death and Ptolemaios (Ptolemy)'s brief introduction.  Scene re-sorting aside, new scenes show a more benevolent Alexander, working to bring Phoenicians in to build Babylon's shallow water harbor, granting gifts to his friends and soldiers, freeing Darius's harem slaves and eunuchs, granting great honors on his conquered enemies, including a scene with Oxyhartes(sp), father of Roxane.  Important scenes, such as the clash with Cleitus, are expanded with more dialogue, more action before and after scenes to provide a more solid foundation for the coming events, and such, adding more depth to some, and more reasoning to others.The Final Cut doesn't radically change the movie, but it solidifies some shaky foundations, and fixes some, but not all, of the flaws with the original cut.  The subplot with Cassander and Roxane, mentioned by Stone in the original commentary, is missing, as is the conflict with Cleitus and Hephaistion.",5,"With all its flaws and everyone's hatred, I simply love it",1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,3776,"['was', 'impressed', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Alexander', 'screen', 'was', 'was', 'obsessed', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'Roman', 'history', 'Then', 're-seeing', 'fell', 'love', 'original', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Director', 'cut', 'was', 'okay', 'not', 'better', 'original.I', 'recently', 'recognized', 'flaws', 'detracted', 'people', 'such', 'lack', 'characterization', 'minor', 'characters', 'seeming', 'characterization', 'Alexander', 'based', 'flaws', 'rather', 'greatness', 'so', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'enough', 'detract', 'intense', 'love', 'movie.I', 'think', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'work', 'Platoon', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'direction', 'brilliant', 'incredible', 'detail', 'put', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'sets', 'simply', 'epic', 'own', 'scale.The', 'Battle', 'Gaugamela', 'sequence', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'believe', 'most', 'accurate', 'ancient', 'battle', 'portrayal', 'Hollywood', 'Aside', 'occasional', 'lapses', 'Phalanx', 'broken', 'apart', 'men', 'fight', 'formation', 'rather', 'wandering', 'field', 'own', 'picking', 'on-on-one', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'style', 'battles.The', 'acting', 'perhaps', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'so', 'fully', 'role', 'impossible', 'see', 'man', 'playing', 'Alexander', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'slick', 'New', 'York', 'agent', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'deadpan', 'bald', 'villain', 'raspy', 'voice', 'Daredevil', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'fully', 'Philip', 'Macedon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'doing', 'other', 'role', 'no', 'longer', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'scarred', 'eyelid', 'thick', 'beard', 'Philippos', 'II', 'Makedon.The', 'lesser-known', 'actors', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'who', 'Hephaistion', 'Gary', 'Stretch', 'who', 'Cleitus', 'Black', 'others', 'playing', 'likes', 'Crateros', 'young', 'Ptolemaios', 'Nearkhos', 'are', 'so', 'fluid', 'roles', 'could', 'quite', 'possibly', 'be', 'actual', 'characters', 'portray', 'Irish', 'British', 'accents', 'all.The', 'Clash', 'Cleitus', 'scene', 'so', 'thickly', 'potent', 'chemistry', 'Farrel', 'Stretch', 'Cleitus', 'shivers', 'spine', 'listening', 'how', 'two', 'rail', 'other', 'how', 'literate', 'scathing', 'understandable', 'Cleitus', 'vocabulary', 'poetry', 'Sophokles', 'writing', 'yet', 'message', 'so', 'simple', 'human', 'universally', 'understood', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'language.Inaccuracies', 'aside', 'had', 'cut', 'condense', 'scenes', 'time', 'including', 'simplification', 'Battle', 'Hydaspes', 'Stone', 'due', 'vast', 'complexity', 'actual', 'battle', 'one', 'more', 'accurate', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Ancient', 'Greece', 'epic', 'own', 'right', 'Love', 'hate', 'epic.The', 'Final', 'Cut', 'even', 'more', 're-arranges', 'scenes', 'so', 'lead-up', 'Battle', 'Gaugamela', 'first', 'scene', 'death', 'Ptolemaios', 'Ptolemy', 'brief', 'introduction', 'Scene', 're-sorting', 'aside', 'new', 'scenes', 'show', 'more', 'benevolent', 'Alexander', 'working', 'bring', 'Phoenicians', 'build', 'Babylon', 'shallow', 'water', 'harbor', 'granting', 'gifts', 'friends', 'soldiers', 'freeing', 'Darius', 'harem', 'slaves', 'eunuchs', 'granting', 'great', 'honors', 'conquered', 'enemies', 'including', 'scene', 'Oxyhartes', 'sp', 'father', 'Roxane', 'Important', 'scenes', 'such', 'clash', 'Cleitus', 'are', 'expanded', 'more', 'dialogue', 'more', 'action', 'scenes', 'provide', 'more', 'solid', 'foundation', 'coming', 'events', 'such', 'adding', 'more', 'depth', 'more', 'reasoning', 'others.The', 'Final', 'Cut', ""n't"", 'radically', 'change', 'movie', 'shaky', 'foundations', 'fixes', 'not', 'flaws', 'original', 'cut', 'subplot', 'Cassander', 'Roxane', 'mentioned', 'Stone', 'original', 'commentary', 'missing', 'conflict', 'Cleitus', 'Hephaistion']",Alexander
910127,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0009PLLN6,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","Ever since seeing `Gladiator' I have been obsessed with the swords-and-sandals epics.  Sadly there hasn't been a film since to really capture all that `Gladiator' was able to capture.  That said, I had really high hopes for `Alexander'.  Oliver Stone is truly a visionary director, if not highly misunderstood.  Some of his films reach levels of greatness (`Natural Born Killers') while others are overshot even for him and fail miserably (`World Trade Center').  `Alexander' falls somewhere in the middle.  It has moments of superbly crafted greatness, yet it has many other moments of meandering mediocrity.  The cast is filled to the brim with big names, yet it is the smallest names that work the best here, and while the film is shot with a truly epic scope it fails to embrace the gritty grandeur that is the very definition of `epic'.Telling the story of Alexander the Great and his rise to power is a hefty assignment.  He's on of the most recognizable faces in World History and his story is one of the most interesting and commanding.  Alexander truly defined the word `great' and his life should lead to one fantastic film.  Sadly Stone doesn't seem to really grasp all that could be had here.  He sees facets of Alexander's life, facets mostly unknown to the American public, and attempts to uncover them and them alone in a way of `enlightening' us.  The problem is that the most memorable and interesting parts of Alexander's life are thus left barely breached.  First and foremost Alexander was a warrior, a leader, a man who conquered the known world at the young age of thirty.  `Alexander' the film never really fleshes out this warrior in him.  The opening line in the film refers to Alexander as a god; but the film never gives us any reason to think so.The action sequences, while decent, are really just that; decent.  I expected so much more from these (especially when word got out about the elephants) but I was disappointed at the amount of confusion these battles led to.  They are choppy and hard to follow.  Another area of complaint was the sets themselves.  While they looked authentic to a degree, everything seemed `too' authentic; if that makes any sense.  Especially in the scenes involving Old Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins); I just felt like I was in a museum.The acting is also a sore spot.  Much has been said in regards to Angelina's poor accent, and while it didn't bother me to the extent that it bothered critics, it really was terrible.  Val Kilmer was atrocious here, and Anthony Hopkins was easily forgettable, which is very uncommon for him.  Jared Leto plays Hephaistion horrifically.  It's sad because his character could have been marvelously portrayed.  It's such a baity role; male lover, friend and advisor to the king; but instead he plays him so subdued and brittle you would never get the impression he was a warrior alongside the king.  He's too much of a badly portrayed stereotype if you get my drift.Colin Farrell on the other hand scores well here.  Many critics balked at his portrayal of the doomed king, but I actually think that Farrell did a superb job.  He goes through so many emotions it would have been easy for any actor to get lost in them and fumble through them so-to-speak but Colin maneuvers himself through this cast array of emotions effortlessly.  I was stunned at his presence.  I have been watching him for a while now and have been so happy with his steady rise in the ranks.  Films like `Tigerland', `Phone Booth' and `Alexander' show what this guy is capable of.  Rosario Dawson also delivers a well crafted performance.  As Roxane, Alexander's bride, she captures her raw exotic persona that made her the woman she was.  While Stone makes it a point to rest Alexander's heart in the hands of men we are able to get a glimpse of the passion Roxane sparked within his soul despite his extramarital longings.One area I can give it the greatest of praise though is the score, which elevates the film in a way and delivers a marvelous tone and mood.  It's beautiful in every way possible.Like I mentioned on the outset; there are moments here that work very well.  This has to do with Farrell's dedication and determination to make it work.  There are just too many moments that don't work for this to be considered a great film, or even a good one.  It moves very slowly in scenes, and while I enjoy a slow-moving character study as much as the next `quote-unquote' critic, I still like to be interested in the subject.  `Alexander' moves at such a pace that it loses the audience in many places.  Oliver Stone might have undershot this one, not taking it to the places it could have gone.  He really could have gone there, taken it to that next level.  With a subject like Alexander the Great you almost have the responsibility to make it big and bold but sadly for the most part `Alexander' is long and dull and uneventful.",2,"It's worth seeing once,

910132,A1L8EJ3MTE72B8,B0009PLLN6,Anthrophile,"[12, 26]","... and not this crap.""Alexander"" is the worst film I've ever seen. I've been trying to think for days now of a film I like less than ""Alexander"" and I can't. Please note that I have seen ""Eight Crazy Nights,"" Demi Moore's ""Scarlet Letter,"" and much of the MST3K oeuvre (with the benefit of sarky robots, of course, and thank god).Believe me when I say I wanted, for a very long time, to like this film. I looked forward to it from the first I heard of it, and I am generally extremely, VERY forgiving of epic swordfighting men-in-skirts dramas, as they are right up my alley. I am impressed by detail, accuracy, and weightiness, but I can happily accept some exciting escapism if that's what's offered. Swordsmen in leather skirts make me unusually charitable. But there are LIMITS.Just so you know, I'm going to spoil like a mo-fo now. I'm not even sorry. And furthermore I consider it a service to all of you -- saving you however-many bucks and three hours of your life that would be far better spent caulking the sink or administering small paper cuts to your inner elbows.I am amazed -- flabbergasted, even -- at people who try to blame this film's box-office flop on homophobia in the audience, when the film ITSELF is such rabid homophobia thinly disguised as tolerance and education as to be sickening.  Were we all watching the correct film? (or maybe the extended version?  With some vindication in it that I maybe missed? Amazon tends to conflate reviews for all versions in one place.)I have never seen such an utter contempt for bisexuality played out with such meticulous care in my life. (Full disclosure: I'm a straight woman; take that as you will.) If I were to find out that this movie had been put together by Rick Santorum and Anita Bryant as a scary ""Requiem for a Dream""-type, morality-play depiction of how ""alternative sexuality"" is a tragic mental ailment that invariably leads one down a flaming path of destruction misery madness alienation and death, I would not be surprised.Every outdated stereotype of the homosexual man is played out. And I'm sure there's more than what I list here: 1) too attached to domineering and overly sexual mother (gayness used to be considered a form of infantilism) 2) at odds with violent, disapproving and often abusive father, and having a weak inability to complete the Oedipal cycle -- replace dad (literal inability to kill him in this case) and hook up with mom or mom equivalent (Roxanne's a little spitfire, just like my Mommy! but sex with her is a joke) 4) constant whiny angst and excessive histrionics -- no certainty or spine of any kind, beyond ""womanish"" 4) all the PREENING and the outfits and the eyeliner and the bacchanals 5) chasing after boys, with pedophilia hinted at -- ""What a pretty army we have now!"" someone says, meaning Alexander's gotten rid of all the ""real-man"" Greek soldiers and replaced them with curly-haired, shiny Babylonian youths 6) oh yeah, the token extreme drag queen.And 7) all intimacy he was supposed to have had with women was played for giggles. Now the man had three wives -- even the movie admits this -- and if he didn't like women and only needed an heir he could have made do with the first one (and if he were only interested in an heir chances are he wouldn't have chosen Roxanne to give him one -- her ethnicity and class were unsuitable). But the movie -- the director, the actors, everybody -- makes all heterosexual activity forced and ludicrous. Case the first being a stroll through a harem that looks like some virgin high-school freshman's interpretation of how brothel whores act when trying to entice a man. Like a room full of sequestered and sheltered women whose country has just been sent to a bloody defeat are immediately going to leap up and being shaking their butts in sinuous dance at the conquering soldiers? Not a scrap of, oh, I don't know, fear? Maybe a leetle resentment? (No, whoops, sorry, we all love Alexander, that's what the voice-over says so it must be true.)""Sex"" with his wife is more like watching two cats up on their haunches having a slap-fight -- and the fight -- which takes place on his wedding night -- starts because the wife sees Alexander standing too close to boyfriend Hephaistion (Jared Leto) in her bridal chamber -- giving Alexander a ring! -- and is grossed out by it (and frankly, the audience is practically encouraged to agree with her.  So where's the ""gay-friendly"" in that???). ""You love him?"" she spits. Okay, so Hephaistion is hustled outa there, and Al is STRIPPING her and he's supposed to be looking at Rosario Dawson's naked self with burning lust -- at least, that's the gist of the words that are coming out of his mouth -- but it comes off more like he's an embarrassed teen who's been caught in the bathroom with a dirty magazine. It's not hot, it's not erotic. It's just... goofy.[Not that the gay love is made any less ludicrous -- it mainly consists of long, arbitrary I-love-you-more-than-life soliloquies which would have embarrassed Romeo and Juliet (and they were 13!). And really long bear hugs. And eye makeup. There's a kiss 2 hours and 15 minutes into the picture, I think -- and not even with Hephaistion! So there. No naked boy love for you.]And that drag queen boy -- that was contemptible -- not for the sake of historical accuracy (the Persian eunuch Bagoas with whom Alexander had a long-term relationship was a real person) -- but because as a character he was used for no reason other than to make Alexander look weak/bad/silly. He had no lines, he didn't influence the film's plot in any way, he doesn't even get a name until the ending credits. He is not a real person, he is a device. (It's worse when they actually put him in armor.) He is the cinematic equivalent of a guy holding up a big placard to cue a studio audience. ""APPLAUSE"" ""BOO"" ""LAUGHTER"" ""GAY"" He's a human laugh track. Oh my god, he's a friggin ""gay track.""Anytime anyone questions Alexander's judgment or fitness to rule, anytime a problem crops up, the camera swings in for a long, significant pan over the face and body of this exaggeratedly feminine, flowy-haired, red-lipped human-TelePrompTer (whom I mistook several times for Rosario Dawson. I was not the only one who did this. Which is really disturbing when you figure in the size of her huge bosom and his total lack thereof). This is not to say he wasn't pretty. But he was so obviously just being USED as the shorthand for ""tragic flaw,"" so that by the time they get to India and he performs his rump-shaking dance in a loincloth with six other boys, it's not even interesting anymore and I just want to go home.And for this blatant stereotype-and-exploitation-FEST to be put out there as ""tolerance"" and ""edginess"" -- for the AUDIENCE to be blamed for not liking it, to hold this effort up as some kind of martyr to forward-thinking -- it is to LAUGH.  Uproariously!Look, Alexander had documented bisexual behavior -- just like every other Greek/Greek-influenced guy of a certain class and status in his time. It was a side issue, no big deal, something older men did with young men they mentored, and then when the kid no longer needed a mentor they stopped doing it (oversimplification, bear with me, this rant is overlong as it is) and you had your wife so you'd have your heirs (and your concubines) and so on. The societal ""epitome of beauty,"" the standard to strive to, if you will, was that of an attractive male youth (hence why you see all the female statues of the period looking mannish, with heavy shoulders, etc.  Often male models were used and breasts were put on as an afterthought). Alexander's tragic flaw, in a narrative sense, was ambition, and made him brutal and took him way farther from home than it was ever logical to go, and it did eventually kill him -- but this film takes that away from him and tells us that his flaw, his obsession, stemmed from his imbalanced nature, and the outward expression of that imbalance was his homosexuality. So basically we are back to calling gayness a mental illness.You know, with the benefit of some time and distance, I can say I honestly admire them for wanting to be honest about Alexander's sexuality? But there's a way to battle cultural stereotypes, and burying them within a horrific film -- horrific on all levels -- is just not the way to do it. Whatever they were trying to do -- their end-product had a lot more in common with blaxploitation than ""liberation.""Angelina Jolie (as mom Olympias), whom I strongly dislike, was the best thing about this film. The only bright spot. She brought life and air to the room and made me feel that my life was not in vain. I perked up every time I heard her odd little Russian accent. (I don't know what she was going for, but it wound up being Russian.) Some critics complained about the snakes, but I've never seen any depiction of the woman that didn't have huge amounts of snakes crawling around -- I'm willing to believe that was at least somewhat rooted in facts. They also complain about her not aging enough, but there are always rumors of sorcery about her -- I think it worked. (I could be grasping at straws.)Val Kilmer (as dad Phillip) whom I have loved since I was 14: Meh.Jared Leto (as Hephaistion) tried really hard. I don't blame him.Rosario Dawson (as first wife Roxanne): Could have been played by anybody attractive.I had thought Farrell was pretty good with accents, but apparently he's not very, because they solve the continuity problem in this film by having nearly everyone playing a Greek use an Irish accent. Including Val Kilmer and Christopher Plummer. Which was actually kind of interesting -- if not exactly successful -- as compared with that typical mid-Atlantic quasi-British thing they usually do (if the actors are capable or not) with ""epics.""  I do rather like the idea of using accents to denote nationality -- very ""Allo Allo."")Colin Farrell was dreadfully miscast, which was my main fear all along and was resoundingly fulfilled. He chose to play the role perpetually wide-eyed, flare-nostriled and weepy or verge-of-weepy. Now, his Hollywood rep is for being an arrogant bastard -- why wouldn't he be able to convey some of that arrogance and confidence in this portrayal of someone who for years was the most powerful man in the known world? He should be able to pull off roguishness at best -- but even that is inappropriate. Alexander was not a little puckish man -- he was the beloved and revered general of the world's most powerful army, and that heroic, mythic quality was completely lost. He thought he was a GOD, thought he could scale walls and lay siege to a city by himself, and his men believed it too, to the point where when he was finally wounded it took them nearly too long to go to him and aid him -- they thought he would just heal -- close his own wounds, leap back up to the top of the wall and lead them again. But in this film, people follow him not because he is magnetic or leaderlike or for charisma or prowess, but because he screams louder than they, and because he is the prince/king and they have no choice.Maybe the film isn't going for myth. But there wasn't any realism either. According to Stone's and Farrell's interpretation, Alexander is an angst-ridden crybaby who would probably lose a playground fight with Rudy Huxtable. (He does lose a playground wrestling match with the kid who will later become his lovah, in a scene where it's revealed that all of the other kids just let him win because he was the prince.) Only the voice-over carries the tale -- TELLING and not SHOWING -- elderly Ptolemy explains how Alexander was ruthless and brutal, how he made an example of Thebes by killing all the men and selling the women into slavery and razing the town to the ground. But we are SHOWN Alexander crying over his Mom's mean words, and every decision he has to make, and the mercy killing of a mortally wounded soldier, and Jared Leto's smudged eyeliner, and the fact that Daddy has a new wife and baby and Mommy wants him to be king but stepmom and new baby are in the way and -- you get the picture. You never believe for a second that this creep is capable of anything like the ruthless actions history attributes to him -- he would be too busy holding little funerals for dead birds he found in the forest.It is so bad that at the deathbed scene of Hephaistion, when Alexander turns away to the open window and delivers his ""moving"" soliloquy, imploring him not to die, with much drama and facial tickery (while behind him, unbeknownst to him, Hephaistion writhes about in his final throes and totally dies) the entire screening audience burst into laughter. It was hilarious. It was like a scene between Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. The man is thrashing about dying on the bed and Colin Farrell, with a beatific, impassioned expression, is declaiming into the sunlight about how ""we'll grow old,"" [audience chuckles] ""and you'll take a wife"" [audience cackles knowingly] ""and our sons will play together -- like we did, Hephaistion!"" [audience is on the floor] ""And when we're old I will follow you to the underworld and we will be together forever, like my ancestor Achilles and Patroclus!"" He turns around and Hephaistion is stiff and grey with his eyes bulging out. [audience passes out from hyperventilation.]Look: There are great stories, and there are stories that are merely okay, but work well according to their own rules -- they're not big test-of-time dramas, but they are seamless and of a piece unto themselves, thus worthwhile. ""Alexander"" doesn't even work as schlock. This film is making me reassess ""Gladiator."" Hell, it's making me reassess ""Hercules: the Legendary Journeys.""This movie does nothing but TELL, from beginning -- where Anthony Hopkins as General Ptolemy narrating to some scribe says ""Alexander was a wonderful guy"" in as many different ways as he can squeeze into 15 minutes (that scroll he was fingering must have been a thesaurus) -- to end, where he pretty much does the same before he lies to the scribe about how Alexander died. (I didn't know that was a matter of scholarly contention but apparently it is, although why I'm even taking that much of this film seriously I do not know.) There is too much bloody talking in this film, and not enough of it makes any sense.These people have chosen to illustrate the life of Alexander the GREAT without dramatizing ANY of the real-life battles or events that made him ""the great""! They showed every battle he lost, and every time his men were pissed at him, and every time he caved in to his Mommy, but anything heroic or grand in scale was narrated by Anthony Hopkins in VO over a closeup of Colin Farrell's incongruously crying face. (I'm still trying to figure out why they think it makes sense that the Persians he had just conquered in a bloody mess loved him so much, but Anthony Hopkins insists that ""Alexander was loved by all."") They didn't even show him giving a rousing pre-battle pep talk. OH my god, Gaugamela -- the first time in the film that he's out speaking to the troops, and the VO is ASSURING me that every-fecking-body just loved the hell out of Alexander, and we're supposed to be about to find out why -- I'm sitting there waiting for ""St. Crispin's Day"" and what does Stone give me? He takes the camera AND THE SOUND away from the speech and takes the audience up into a high CGI shot of the landscape and a bird. A BIRD? Cawing? This is inspiration? No, this is covering for lousy screenwriters. Holy sledgehammer: Eagles are cliche, but I've never seen one used that badly. Even Brad Pitt's two-second ""Troy"" speech was better. Two seconds! ""What awaits you on that beach? Immortality! Take it! It's yours!!!"" As opposed to the ten-minute ""Flight of the Eagle.""It's not even a pretty movie. ""Troy"" at the very least had awesome, flowing, creative cinematography (and the short skirts on the men looked hot. In ""Alexander"" the short skirts look like diapers). Faces are lingered on for no real reason (they do this most often to the Persian king Darius, who also doesn't have a single line of dialogue). Alexander's fight scenes are choppy and impossible to follow -- they have neither the redeeming balletic quality of the choreographed battle scenes in ""Lord of the Rings,"" nor the redeeming gutsy realism of a ""Saving Private Ryan."" They are as confusing and bloody as a real battle, I imagine, but you are not made to care one whit what happens to these people -- it's like playing Resident Evil. Just fodder. You can't even readily distinguish the uniforms. A cockamamie, ugly red lens-wash over scenes substitutes for real drama, and the music is a far too jaunty trumpet-based thing -- triumphant even when the Greeks are losing.And what am I to think of the editing when here you have Farrell standing in a completely different position and a different part of the room between camera cuts?  What I think is that the director takes his audience for slow-minded and unobservant.And what was up with ""Tax Bill"" and the like written in ""Greek-looking"" English text during the ""now-let's-govern!"" montage?  What are we, ten?  Is this a cartoon?There is an 8-year flashback about 45 minutes from the end of this 3-hour film. It is the only flashback in the whole film. It is also a very long flashback, and as a directorial decision it makes no sense. It's also rather important as it deals with the DEATH BY MURDER OF KING BLOODY PHILLIP. (That would be Alexander's DAD) Oh nevermind. It's exhausting trying to find sense in this thing.It's a cliche to wish for a ""negative stars"" option on Amazon, but that is very much where I am right now.As for me, I'm going to get ahold of ""Reign: The Conqueror"" to wash the taste out of my mouth. SOMEBODY's got to get it right.

910133,A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B0009PLLN6,"Antoine D. Reid ""80sforever""","[13, 15]","I've definately seen better movies than this. ""Troy"" may have played with history and some facts but at least it sort of had a plot, good direction, and kept you hooked throughout. This though, this is long. Scenes seem to be out of place and you'll get whiplash simply trying to keep up; they'll go from showing him as a young child to a teenager, then a grown man. They leave out parts of the story to be brought up later, which is rather distracting when those scenes last for what feels like forever, and you're jerked back into the present or back to the past.The only thing appealing about this movie is perhaps the Hollywood glamour. Watching Angelina Jolie and Colin Farrell is great, but when they both look the same age and you're supposed to accept Jolie as Alexander's mother? There's nothing really engaging about the plot or script. The dialogue is either weak or mumbled through, making the movie feel truly long and rather dull. I personally didn't have a problem with Alexander being portrayed as bisexual. What I did have a problem with is that as other reviewers have said, it wasn't handled well. It was at times over the top. The men he was attracted to were all made out to be femenine, which may have been the case, but there's no historical basis for this and it's a bit offensive to think that the only type of man that could have been appealing to Alexander ""the Great"" were femenine. Why did he feel attracted to men? Why wasn't there more of a focus on his children, or his military strategy. He just seemed ... confused. Overly emotional.Well, as for special features ... there are the theatrical trailers, and there's a behind-the-scenes documentary featuring Oliver Stone and a look at the filming and setbacks that occured during the movie. Even it was poorly done. People's voices are muffled, it's hard to understand what's being said, it drags on, not much more is added to the film. I was hoping to hear why Stone chose to shoot the movie as he did. Why he chose to focus on Alexander's sexuality more so than his other attributes. If he gave an explanation, it was lost in all his muffled and jarbled speaking, and his cursing.This film definately makes the other epic films of the past few years stand out more and shine like great works of art. It lacks good direction, should have been edited differently, and the actor's accents (among many other things) are just inconsistant and makes this look like it was rushed through production and all. It's an okay movie, I'm not sure if it's worth purchasing, but it's okay. There's a director's cut that's supposed to be better edited with scenes re-arranged (a sign that this original cut wasn't really well-thought out and perhaps rushed out to theaters before beign produced right).I'd be wary to suggest anyone purcahse this. It's a weak movie that really doesn't engage the audience in the story. It doesn't setup or play out the characters that well and the scenes are oddly placed and arranged throughout the movie. Something else I found a bit distracting is that you have to get up in the middle of the movie just to change discs to see the entire film. Beware of what you're getting. If you're a fan of Colin Farrell, I'm sure you'll find this movie decent, but it's not his best work. Enough said, I suppose.",2,I've Seen Better,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,3304,"[""'ve"", 'definately', 'seen', 'better', 'movies', 'Troy', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'history', 'facts', 'least', 'sort', 'had', 'plot', 'good', 'direction', 'kept', 'hooked', 'though', 'long', 'Scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'place', ""'ll"", 'get', 'whiplash', 'simply', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', ""'ll"", 'go', 'showing', 'young', 'child', 'teenager', 'then', 'grown', 'man', 'leave', 'out', 'parts', 'story', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'later', 'rather', 'distracting', 'when', 'scenes', 'last', 'what', 'feels', 'forever', ""'re"", 'jerked', 'back', 'present', 'back', 'past.The', 'only', 'thing', 'appealing', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'Hollywood', 'glamour', 'Watching', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'great', 'when', 'look', 'same', 'age', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'accept', 'Jolie', 'Alexander', 'mother', 'nothing', 'really', 'engaging', 'plot', 'script', 'dialogue', 'weak', 'mumbled', 'making', 'movie', 'feel', 'truly', 'long', 'rather', 'dull', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'Alexander', 'being', 'portrayed', 'bisexual', 'What', 'did', 'have', 'problem', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'handled', 'well', 'was', 'times', 'top', 'men', 'was', 'attracted', 'were', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'femenine', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'historical', 'basis', 'bit', 'offensive', 'think', 'only', 'type', 'man', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'appealing', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'were', 'femenine', 'Why', 'did', 'feel', 'attracted', 'men', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'more', 'focus', 'children', 'military', 'strategy', 'just', 'seemed', 'confused', 'Overly', 'emotional.Well', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'look', 'filming', 'setbacks', 'occured', 'movie', 'Even', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'People', 'voices', 'are', 'muffled', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'added', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'hear', 'why', 'Stone', 'chose', 'shoot', 'movie', 'did', 'Why', 'chose', 'focus', 'Alexander', 'sexuality', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'attributes', 'gave', 'explanation', 'was', 'lost', 'muffled', 'jarbled', 'speaking', 'cursing.This', 'film', 'definately', 'other', 'epic', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'stand', 'out', 'more', 'shine', 'great', 'works', 'art', 'good', 'direction', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'differently', 'actor', 'accents', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'inconsistant', 'look', 'was', 'rushed', 'production', 'okay', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'okay', 'director', 'cut', 'supposed', 'be', 'better', 'edited', 'scenes', 're-arranged', 'sign', 'original', 'cut', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'well-thought', 'perhaps', 'rushed', 'out', 'theaters', 'beign', 'produced', 'right', '.I', ""'d"", 'be', 'wary', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'purcahse', 'weak', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'engage', 'audience', 'story', ""n't"", 'setup', 'play', 'out', 'characters', 'well', 'scenes', 'are', 'oddly', 'placed', 'arranged', 'movie', 'Something', 'else', 'found', 'bit', 'distracting', 'have', 'get', 'up', 'middle', 'movie', 'just', 'change', 'discs', 'see', 'entire', 'film', 'Beware', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Colin', 'Farrell', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'find', 'movie', 'decent', 'not', 'best', 'work', 'Enough', 'said', 'suppose']",Alexander
910134,A3ONCOK36KPOV8,B0009PLLN6,A Reviewer,"[8, 12]","This film illustrates why a big budget and big name director do not necessarily equal a good film. This one is a train wreck from beginning to end. There is a great deal of talking, speechifying and narration throughout. Not appropriate for an  action film about the conquest of the then known world. The best film makers ""show us"" rather than ""tell us"", as Ridley Scott did in Gladiator, a film which Oliver Stone could have learned something from. Anthony Hopkins narration brought to mind the snowman, voiced by Burl Ives, who narrated Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer! There were also too many flashbacks. A more linear telling of the story would have worked better. The battle scenes in this movie were also incomprehensible. I had no idea who won or what was going on. As for the actors, Colin Farrell really lacked the gravitas to play Alexander. Russell Crowe had me convinced he was a warrior in Gladiator. In this film, Colin Farrell did not. It was hard to see why anyone would follow him into battle. Rosario Dawson is an attractive actress, but in this film plays a woman from Bactria, which is in present day Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. She bears no physical resemblance to anyone from that region. And what was with Angelina Jolie's accent? All in all, this film took one of the most inherently interesting stories in history, and turned it into something that left me constantly hitting the display button, to see how much more of it I had to watch.",1,What  a Stinker,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,1463,"['film', 'why', 'big', 'budget', 'big', 'name', 'director', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'equal', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'train', 'wreck', 'beginning', 'end', 'great', 'deal', 'talking', 'speechifying', 'narration', 'Not', 'appropriate', 'action', 'film', 'conquest', 'then', 'known', 'world', 'best', 'film', 'makers', 'show', 'rather', 'tell', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'did', 'Gladiator', 'film', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'could', 'have', 'learned', 'something', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'narration', 'brought', 'mind', 'snowman', 'voiced', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'who', 'narrated', 'Rudolph', 'Red', 'Nosed', 'Reindeer', 'were', 'also', 'too', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'more', 'linear', 'telling', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'battle', 'movie', 'were', 'also', 'incomprehensible', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'won', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'actors', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'really', 'lacked', 'gravitas', 'play', 'Alexander', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'had', 'convinced', 'was', 'warrior', 'Gladiator', 'film', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'follow', 'battle', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'attractive', 'actress', 'film', 'woman', 'Bactria', 'present', 'day', 'Uzbekistan', 'Afghanistan', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'anyone', 'region', 'what', 'was', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'accent', 'film', 'took', 'one', 'most', 'inherently', 'interesting', 'stories', 'history', 'turned', 'something', 'left', 'constantly', 'hitting', 'display', 'button', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'had', 'watch']",Alexander
910135,A1QG4TLIYZRL7L,B0009PLLN6,"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim""","[0, 0]","I suggest watching the film with director Oliver Stone's commentary on the film that addresses many of the complaints about his movie, Alexander.Although a lot of people declare the film as historically inaccurate, those arguments don't seem correct.  Many of the books on Alexander were written two or three generations after Alexander's death, and an educated person has to carefully distinguish probable fact from a legend.  Oliver Stone appears to have done a remarkably good job of weeding through history books to locate the most credible information.  The movie's acute narrative seems to ""cross the grain"" in the wrong direction for many people who decided to object to the movie.  Stone's vision for this movie were based on academic resources.Why do people have so much trouble enjoying this movie?  That's easy to answer.  Western audiences obviously don't like movies that focus on love stories between men.  This is not to say ""sex"", since the movie is not about sex.  It is about male love.  A few people criticize the movie because its protagonist has a friend so close to him that people mis-understand their relation as homosexual in nature.  As Stone points out on the DVD commentary of his director's cut, history shows no evidence of any sexual involvement between those two people.  So, people don't know that they were sexually involved, even if some would prefer to believe it to simplify the movie plot.  They wince at the act of male physical relations that are not treated as sex and when they are not homosexual.  The reaction of criticizing the movie for these two characters obviously stems from personal bias deriving out of Western pop culture and pseudo-belief that men should not have loving relations, as though pop culture knows what manhood is about.  Since Stone uses Alexander to question these themes about recent Western society, people have seen fit to do lots of jokes about this movie.  If the reason to doubt this movie is for those jokes, then those people misunderstand the movie deliberately, and solely upon their personal convictions already biased.  How can anyone be angry at this movie's choices in its portrayals when the proper questions about the Greek imperialist aristocrats derives in-part out of their psychology, which included sexual acts that do not exclude people on a basis of their sex such as in current Western bias?  Not showing the meaning of that bi-sexuality, where these leaders thought of themselves as gods, they would not be restricted to a single form of sexuality.  This is portrayed in Alexander with a large degree of respect to historical truth.  Stone could've made a movie that blatantly disregards these facts, but lacking this integration, like other movies on Alexander the Great, disregard the function of sexuality and how it affected the historical figure's influence.He was a smart man, he was a conqueror, he was as homosexual as any Greek aristocrat, HE CRIED AFTER BATTLES IN PLAIN VIEW, and, if you don't like it, screw you.  (What do you know?)I also don't appreciate the argument that people should not be taught by a movie, since that is specifically why movies are good.  Don't think I don't relate to people who say they don't like to be lectured, but isn't that what makes people smarter?  Isn't that why people go to school, to listen to lectures?

910136,A1FELVXDM22O3K,B0009PLLN6,astrorev,"[1, 4]","My first criticism in this review is leveled at Amazon.com. With three ""cuts"" of this movie, obviously Oliver Stone felt a real need to differentiate these films from one another, ""improving"" them until he was satisfied.  Why then, when we look up each of these cuts on Amazon, is the same Amazon review given (the Revisited review)?  I would like to have had their professional take on each edition, and some details on how & why number two is different from number one, not just how the last is different from its two previous renditions. The information would be very helpful in deciding if I should give the other versions I have not seen, a viewing.  Also, why has Amazon combined all of the public's reviews into all three editions.  For the vast majority of reviews it's impossible to tell which edition they are reviewing.  Not very helpful at all!!!As far as the movie goes (I saw the second one, the Director's cut) I can understand why this movie got mixed reviews and ended up well below the hoped for high marks.  The movie comes across confused, starting out with narration, is almost documentary-like in places, jumps into much needed story content, often detours back in time unchronologically, then attempts to figure out how all this fits together to form one big cohesive picture.  Which it hardly does.  The movie rather fails to come across as epic, it mostly feels just long.  Not that there weren't some successful aspects.  I enjoy most of the acting by the lead performers.  It was good to see Val Kilmer back in a substantial role after being in so many ""B"" movies.  Angelina Jolie is mesmerizing as usual.  And Colin Farrell demonstrates his capabilities in portraying emotional content with ease and credibility.  And there are a number of well-renowned actors in minor roles, though their contribution fails to help this disjointed story.  I liked some of the cinematography very much.  The portrayal of Babylon was intriguing.With THREE versions of this movie available, we have a clear clue that something has been amiss with this movie from the beginning, and with the incredible time commitment of this film it's going to be a long time before I'll watch the other versions to see how they are different, or, more importantly, if the story gets any better.",2,Alexander not so great,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,2289,"['first', 'criticism', 'review', 'leveled', 'Amazon.com', 'three', 'cuts', 'movie', 'obviously', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'felt', 'real', 'need', 'differentiate', 'films', 'one', 'improving', 'was', 'satisfied', 'Why', 'then', 'when', 'look', 'up', 'cuts', 'Amazon', 'same', 'Amazon', 'review', 'given', 'Revisited', 'review', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'had', 'professional', 'take', 'edition', 'details', 'how', 'why', 'number', 'two', 'different', 'number', 'one', 'not', 'just', 'how', 'last', 'different', 'two', 'previous', 'renditions', 'information', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'helpful', 'deciding', 'should', 'give', 'other', 'versions', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'viewing', 'Also', 'why', 'Amazon', 'combined', 'public', 'reviews', 'three', 'editions', 'vast', 'majority', 'reviews', 'impossible', 'tell', 'edition', 'are', 'reviewing', 'Not', 'very', 'helpful', 'As', 'far', 'movie', 'saw', 'second', 'one', 'Director', 'cut', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'got', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'ended', 'up', 'well', 'hoped', 'high', 'marks', 'movie', 'confused', 'starting', 'out', 'narration', 'almost', 'documentary-like', 'places', 'much', 'needed', 'story', 'content', 'often', 'back', 'time', 'unchronologically', 'then', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'together', 'form', 'one', 'big', 'cohesive', 'picture', 'hardly', 'movie', 'rather', 'come', 'epic', 'mostly', 'just', 'long', 'Not', 'were', ""n't"", 'successful', 'aspects', 'enjoy', 'most', 'acting', 'lead', 'performers', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'back', 'substantial', 'role', 'being', 'so', 'many', 'B', 'movies', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'mesmerizing', 'usual', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'capabilities', 'portraying', 'emotional', 'content', 'ease', 'credibility', 'are', 'number', 'well-renowned', 'actors', 'minor', 'roles', 'contribution', 'help', 'disjointed', 'story', 'liked', 'cinematography', 'very', 'much', 'portrayal', 'Babylon', 'was', 'intriguing.With', 'THREE', 'versions', 'movie', 'available', 'have', 'clear', 'clue', 'something', 'been', 'amiss', 'movie', 'beginning', 'incredible', 'time', 'commitment', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'long', 'time', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'other', 'versions', 'see', 'how', 'are', 'different', 'more', 'importantly', 'story', 'better']",Alexander

Alexander also has me questioning the greatness of Oliver Stone as a director, and I will have to be compelled to take his name off the Best Director list.

Everybody was awful in Alexander, and the movie was so frigging long and utterly pointless in the sea of fogginess and confusion. A lot of cliches ravages Alexander as already the official prostitute, Angelina Jolie, reprises once again a slutty role; Colin Farrell, being a lame, pretentious Irish actor, plays in a non-Irish role; Anthony Hopkins plays an extremely pompous narrator and overly philosopher; Val Kilmer is acting like Jim Morrison once again; and Oliver Stone's overabundance of 70's atmosphere used in Doors, Natural Born Killers, and U-Turn.

There were some parts of ""Alexander"" that were interesting, but overall it was a dull three hours. If this movie was to take place in Greece (Macedon), why was everyone speaking with British or Irish accents? Speaking of accents, Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson had the worse fake accents I had ever heard. You would think they would've done some research on the accents of Mediterreanean/Middle Eastern women. That would've been much better than hearing awful Russian accents. And why not have an older actress play Olympia? Angelina Jolie playing  Olympia, Alexander's mother, was totally unbelievable since Angelina and Colin Farrell are roughly around the same age. The war scene in the beginning of the movie was confusing to watch. There was so much dust everywhere that it was hard to tell who was fighting who. The other war scene, which took place in India, was the only time the movie got exciting. By that time the movie was almost over. I don't know much about Alexander the Great, but if you rely on Hollywood for your history what you'll get from this movie is that Alexander is an overemotional mama's boy, who likes boys, and wants to ""conquer"" the known world to bring freedom to everyone.

I was seriously hesitant to watch this sucker at all, considering how it got lambasted by the critics and many, many others.So the big question on your mind is ""Was it really that bad?""Yes ...and no. Sorry. I'm not trying to cut hairs by saying ""define sex"", as Bill Clinton would. I'm just trying to say that there were definitely some excellent qualities in this film that made it watchable.But there were also some serious downers that made it painful, too.For me, I didn't have a problem with the acting nor the actors. I thought all of them (yes, even Jolie with her faux-whatever-accent) gave a fine performance. I love Val Kilmer as an actor, and I wasn't disappointed by his portrayal of Phillip, the father of Alexander.Anthony Hopkins, as always, was fine as the aging Ptolemy who gives us his narrative take of Alexander throughout the film.The battle scenes were well done, too. You may have heard about ""The Elephant Battle"", and how great it was. Well it is. This alone may well be worth the price of renting the film.In true Oliver Stone fashion, we also get the colorful scenes of death and destruction, never holding back (ala Platoon, 1986).Where the movie falters is in its execution and screenplay. The storyline jumps us back and forth and back and forth and back and forth in time, trying to make sense of why Alexander is the way he is. This was terribly irritating and, sometimes, confusing.""Are we in 329 A.D. again?""""No.""""Oh.""But the film is not as bad as the critics would have you believe. And the Greeks (the current Greeks) just need to shut up about the ""gay"" scenes and eat a few more olives. It was common for men to take other men as lovers. Twas no big deal. And it's not like this film showed two men pumping away at each other. There were only three hugs, two sets of tears, a few words of affection, and one simple kiss. Whoopty-Doo.I do feel that the problem with the movie is that Stone tried to cover too much information in one short film (although 3 hours might not seem that short to some). But when you try to capture all of the essence of one man who changed the course of history in one, quick stroke, I think you're bound to fail. This thing should've been a miniseries, about 6-12 hours in length, in order to keep the story flow moving forward without the confusing and constant flashbacks.So is it worth your time? I think so.

910142,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0009PLLN6,Brian E. Erland,"[4, 5]","I had such high hopes for this movie. Warner Brothers had assembled some of my favorite actors and actresses to star in this biographical epic, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, not to mention my growing fondness for Rosario Dawson, Colin Farrell and Jared Leto. Add to that the fact that Oliver Stone was the director really peaked my interest. You see, I'm a big fan of Oliver Stones' work in 'The Doors' film and I was hoping he would develop the storyline of 'Alexander' along the same mystical, shamanic stream as he did with Jim Morrison. He didn't.What fascinates me the most about the larger-than-life figure of Alexander the Great was not his great victories in battle, nor his political genius as demonstrated in the consolidation of nations under Greek rule. The Alexander I had hoped to see explored by Oliver Stone was Alexander the 'Divine.' I wanted to witness his triumphful entry into Alexandria and Cairo to the cheering throngs proclaiming him the ""Sun God."" I longed to enter into the inner recesses of the great pyramid of Cheops with him for his nocturnal vigil in the 'Kings' Chamber' and explore the visions and revelations that unfolded on that historic night.Incredibly none of this was included, his campaign in Egypt received only a brief mention by Anthony Hopkins as part of an intermitent narration of events provided by the director to fill in the blanks. That's some blank as far as I'm concerned! The only mystical aspects included was the occasional appearance of an eagle flying overhead, leading him forward to new lands and new people and it's visit to his Mother in the end announcing his death.We all have our own subjective expectations, this one didn't meet mine. That said, I must admit that I'm probably rating this film - One Star - lower than it actually deserves. I think I'm judging it more by what I wanted to see included and wasn't, than commenting on what was actually in the film. Be that as it may, I guess that's the reviewers perogative.The final and ultimate test for any movie is the 'repeatability factor.' Can I watch it over and over again?

But thats about all the pluses i have on this movie...After watching this movie i never got the feeling of 'Wow, Alexander really was great.' Sure he conquered the large part of the known world but i never got the sense of his accomplishments. What he did and ruled was put on the back burner to focus on his troubled relationships.And it seemed no one liked the poor guy. From his parents, to his wife, to his soldiers, to his enemies, no one liked him... except for Jared Leto of course.And all this hate of Alexander ends in an anti-climatic death. Blah.And there were two battle scenes in this 3 hour movie. Two!And while both showed a grand scale of battle, there were plenty of mish mash parts in the fights with a lot of clips thrown together. An average battle scene of one minute would have 30 different fight clips each lasting about 2 seconds. Not enough focus in the fights.Though there was a ridiculous focus on the elephant vs horse battle in which Alexander gets injured.All in all i feel this movie deserves all of the negativity and failure that follows it around.

Good for you, Mr. Stone, you've done a marvelous job!The actors did a very well with this difficult subject matter and I say, so what if Colin Farrell lapsed into his Irish brogue upon occasion as some ""reviewer"" mentioned.

Also, had the story been sequential, it would have become tedious and the audience would have lost interest quickly.

910150,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0009PLLN6,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 3]","This is a pretty amazing film. It has a highly talented cast yet there is a tendency to overacting that makes the film to have more in common with 1950s Hollywood epics like ""The Ten Commandments"" rather than with more naturalistic, realistic contemporary films. Since all the actors overact, with the exceptions of Christopher Plummer as Aristotle, Anthony Hopkins as the aged Ptolemy, and Jared Leto as Hephaestus, the blame must reside with the director. The historic record would point to Alexander the Great as a tremendous egomaniacal and charismatic leader. Yet here the script tries to elevate Alexander's mission beyond conquest and discovery into some vague concept of universal respect for diversity which may be a contemporary value but was probably not a value of the ancient world of conquest. Listen to the dialogue where Alexander argues with his generals about his desire that they take wives and produce children among the nations they overcome rather than focus on returning to their wives and children in Macedonia with vast treasures and slaves. An argument could be made that he wished to find a way to sustain his victories, which may occur if the victor impregnates the vanquished and establishes kingdoms overseen by the children of these marriages and unions. Great leaders wish to sustain their victories and intermarriage with the defeated nations and tribes may have indeed been Alexander's strategy. Certainly he followed this strategy with this marriage to Roxannas. But if this was truly the case then why was Alexander also compelled to follow a path of discovery to the ends of the known world, particularly in demonstrating that beyond India is the origin of the Nile which, if followed, would bring him and his troops back to the Mediterranean Sea. The speeches delivered by Alexander to his troops wavered in theme from appealing to their desire for conquest and treasure, to that of becoming rules of these new vanquished worlds, to that of discovering the Nile beyond India which will lead them to their homes. Eventually all the arguments fail and he must return or risk total mutiny.The homosexuality of Alexander is presented in an interesting manner in the film. Alexander seems to have a permanent emotional attachment to his childhood friend Hephaestus but is sexually drawn to the Persian slave boy that becomes his lover. In the first half of the film he asks Hephaestus to sleep with him but he gradually transitions to the Persian slave boy without losing his attachment to Hephaestus as his most honest and trusted companion. His attachment to his wife seems to be one whereby he wished to create a dynasty among the people he conquered. Maybe the film reflects the truth that it is rare that any human relationship will meet all needs.The film is visually stunning, as beautiful as any Biblical or Ancient world epic produced in the last 40 years. Yet the narrative sequence is too jolting, bouncing back and forth in time too often. The film would have been further strengthened by a chronological presentation and the inclusion of Alexander's conquest of Greece and Egypt to give a full presentation of the size of this young man's military achievements.",4,Beautiful and Improved and yet still flawed,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,3207,"['pretty', 'amazing', 'film', 'highly', 'talented', 'cast', 'yet', 'tendency', 'overacting', 'film', 'have', 'more', 'common', '1950s', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'rather', 'more', 'naturalistic', 'realistic', 'contemporary', 'films', 'actors', 'overact', 'exceptions', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Aristotle', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'aged', 'Ptolemy', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Hephaestus', 'blame', 'must', 'reside', 'director', 'historic', 'record', 'would', 'point', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'tremendous', 'egomaniacal', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'here', 'script', 'elevate', 'Alexander', 'mission', 'conquest', 'discovery', 'vague', 'concept', 'universal', 'respect', 'diversity', 'may', 'be', 'contemporary', 'value', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'value', 'ancient', 'world', 'conquest', 'Listen', 'dialogue', 'where', 'Alexander', 'generals', 'desire', 'take', 'wives', 'produce', 'children', 'nations', 'overcome', 'rather', 'focus', 'returning', 'wives', 'children', 'Macedonia', 'vast', 'treasures', 'slaves', 'argument', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'wished', 'find', 'way', 'sustain', 'victories', 'may', 'occur', 'victor', 'vanquished', 'establishes', 'kingdoms', 'overseen', 'children', 'marriages', 'unions', 'Great', 'leaders', 'wish', 'sustain', 'victories', 'intermarriage', 'defeated', 'nations', 'tribes', 'may', 'have', 'indeed', 'been', 'Alexander', 'strategy', 'Certainly', 'followed', 'strategy', 'marriage', 'Roxannas', 'was', 'truly', 'case', 'then', 'why', 'was', 'Alexander', 'also', 'compelled', 'follow', 'path', 'discovery', 'ends', 'known', 'world', 'particularly', 'demonstrating', 'India', 'origin', 'Nile', 'followed', 'would', 'bring', 'troops', 'back', 'Mediterranean', 'Sea', 'speeches', 'delivered', 'Alexander', 'troops', 'wavered', 'theme', 'appealing', 'desire', 'conquest', 'treasure', 'becoming', 'rules', 'new', 'vanquished', 'worlds', 'discovering', 'Nile', 'India', 'will', 'lead', 'homes', 'Eventually', 'arguments', 'fail', 'must', 'return', 'risk', 'total', 'mutiny.The', 'homosexuality', 'Alexander', 'presented', 'interesting', 'manner', 'film', 'Alexander', 'have', 'permanent', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Hephaestus', 'sexually', 'drawn', 'Persian', 'slave', 'boy', 'lover', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Hephaestus', 'sleep', 'gradually', 'Persian', 'slave', 'boy', 'losing', 'attachment', 'Hephaestus', 'most', 'honest', 'trusted', 'companion', 'attachment', 'wife', 'be', 'one', 'whereby', 'wished', 'create', 'dynasty', 'people', 'conquered', 'Maybe', 'film', 'truth', 'rare', 'human', 'relationship', 'will', 'meet', 'needs.The', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'as', 'beautiful', 'Biblical', 'Ancient', 'world', 'epic', 'produced', 'last', '40', 'years', 'narrative', 'sequence', 'too', 'jolting', 'bouncing', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'too', 'often', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'further', 'strengthened', 'chronological', 'presentation', 'inclusion', 'Alexander', 'conquest', 'Greece', 'Egypt', 'give', 'full', 'presentation', 'size', 'young', 'man', 'military', 'achievements']",Alexander

They were laying on the accents so heavy, and by the way they did soung all like irish accents, that well what can I say. With the withholding of emotion between Alexander and his ""lover"", I believe that might have created a detachment from the viewers perspective. I you want to indulge into his sexuality... THEN DO IT, don't play with the audience or better yet do go puritanical after choosing to focus on the sexuality and male to male relationship of the characters.

There were controversies over its portrayal of the bisexuality of its protagonist, as well as the poor screenplay, stilted dialogue, and many other things.... We get the requisite battles, the CGI armies of huge hordes, but Stone's camera work is not what it was a decade or more ago. There is very little that sets this apart as an Oliver Stone film. It's a generic pseudo-epic that makes the great epics, like Spartacus, or Lawrence Of Arabia, seem that much greater. I guess there's just a simple lack of passion in the whole endeavor. What saves the film from being total trash, however, is Val Kilmer's relationship with Alexander- mostly as a boy (Connor Paolo), but also with the older Farrell. Kilmer's best moment comes when he demands buying a horse at half price if Alexander can tame it. The son, of course, tames it, in generic rite of passage form, but the key that makes this otherwise trite scene work is how Philip will to risk his son's life merely for a bargain. It shows why the two men will bond, but never be truly close.... In short, Alexander fails not for many of the reasons the major critics roasted it (although to be fair, I don't know just how different the filmic and DVD versions are) but because it has too much breadth, and not enough depth.

Oliver stone put to much focus on the characters and neglected the interesting significance of the history and culture that surrounded Alexander in that day. This was evident as we recieved a vague view of Babylon, greece, Alexanderia and India. There was hardly an impression that this story was taking place during the 3rd century BC. There wasnt so much of an extended street shot in Macedonia to provide the viewer a vicarious experience of being there. This failure to connect the viewer with the historical aspects of that period was  one of the major  downfalls of this movie.. Sure there were great special effects and fight scences but, ""Alexander"" failed to capture the emphasis on History and Culture To the level ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy"" Achieved. Those movies were more visually compelling to the viewer by showing the the vast scale and detail of the cities and surroundings which gave the viewer an idea of being there..I also Felt Collin Farrell looked to weak and small in stature to be a believable conquerer. Colin didnt embellish the characher which proved that he wasn't the right actor for this role. Collin that I think this role could have been played by an other actor that was randomly chosen. In spite Farrel's average acting job and sub par stage presence, Oliver Stones portrayal  of Alexander as a suicidal and sensitive madman was the major flaw which prevented the character from being likeable or understandible. Stone failed to show Alexander's intelligence for strategical battle skills. Instead, we are lead to believe that each victory was as a result of Alexanders suicidal tendencies in battle which simply is rediculous.. It's true that history showed Alexander to be very daring and brave however, his accomplishments as a conquerer were mainly driven by his vision and strategies to overcome his opposition..I didnt so much mind the homosexual scenes however, I felt they were over emphasized while other important points of Alexanders character traits as a conquerer were not emphasized enough.By the way, Val Kilmer and Angelina did a good in their roles..",3,"This ""ALEXANDER"" failed to achieve Greatness",1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,2175,"['felt', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'missed', 'point', 'making', 'true', 'historical', 'epic..', 'Oliver', 'stone', 'put', 'much', 'focus', 'characters', 'neglected', 'interesting', 'significance', 'history', 'culture', 'surrounded', 'Alexander', 'day', 'was', 'evident', 'recieved', 'vague', 'view', 'Babylon', 'greece', 'Alexanderia', 'India', 'was', 'hardly', 'impression', 'story', 'was', 'taking', 'place', '3rd', 'century', 'BC', 'so', 'much', 'extended', 'street', 'shot', 'Macedonia', 'provide', 'viewer', 'vicarious', 'experience', 'being', 'there', 'failure', 'connect', 'viewer', 'historical', 'aspects', 'period', 'was', 'one', 'major', 'downfalls', 'movie..', 'Sure', 'were', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'fight', 'scences', 'Alexander', 'failed', 'capture', 'emphasis', 'History', 'Culture', 'level', 'Gladiator', 'Troy', 'Achieved', 'movies', 'were', 'more', 'visually', 'compelling', 'viewer', 'showing', 'vast', 'scale', 'detail', 'cities', 'surroundings', 'gave', 'viewer', 'idea', 'being', 'there..I', 'also', 'Felt', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'looked', 'weak', 'small', 'stature', 'be', 'believable', 'conquerer', 'Colin', 'didnt', 'embellish', 'characher', 'proved', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'actor', 'role', 'Collin', 'think', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'other', 'actor', 'was', 'randomly', 'chosen', 'spite', 'Farrel', 'average', 'acting', 'job', 'sub', 'par', 'stage', 'presence', 'Oliver', 'Stones', 'portrayal', 'Alexander', 'suicidal', 'sensitive', 'madman', 'was', 'major', 'flaw', 'prevented', 'character', 'being', 'likeable', 'understandible', 'Stone', 'failed', 'show', 'Alexander', 'intelligence', 'strategical', 'battle', 'skills', 'Instead', 'are', 'lead', 'believe', 'victory', 'was', 'result', 'Alexanders', 'suicidal', 'tendencies', 'battle', 'simply', 'rediculous..', 'true', 'history', 'showed', 'Alexander', 'be', 'very', 'daring', 'brave', 'however', 'accomplishments', 'conquerer', 'were', 'mainly', 'driven', 'vision', 'strategies', 'overcome', 'opposition..I', 'so', 'much', 'homosexual', 'scenes', 'however', 'felt', 'were', 'over', 'emphasized', 'other', 'important', 'points', 'Alexanders', 'character', 'traits', 'conquerer', 'were', 'not', 'emphasized', 'way', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Angelina', 'did', 'good', 'roles..']",Alexander

That would make him a Leo.As a fellow Leo, I could relate to his ambitions and his fiery passions. Not to mention his zest for life. In astrological terms, the Leo zodiac is governed by the sun, thus philosophically speaking, Alexander is driven by fire. No doubt there are also many references made during the course of the movie in regards to the looking towards the sky, thus the sun.Already, it was stated in the movie by old Ptlomey (played with reverence by Anthony Hopkins) that Alexander ""the Great"" does not exist. The historians (particularly the Greek ones)idolised him. Made him more than a man. They made him a demi-god who will be passed into legends and myths like those of Herakles and Achilles.For a more contemporary, but not really reliable, biographical point of view, Plutarch's works would be the one to go for. But, as for now, Oliver Stone's admirable film would do. What I do not get is that why Americans are not susceptible to such films? As Stone mentioned in his commentary, he suspected that the American audiences didn't like ""teaching"" movies, and he modified the Aristotle tutoring scene. At the same time, he also stated that the audiences could not count the years in B.C.However, such facts are trivial. Stone's film did not really do justice over the towering achievements of Alexander. However, he did get some things right. For instance, Alexander's world view that all races and countries can be united under one system (be it language, governance, education, military, etc.) That point is admirable, let alone, an ancient conqueror could have dreamt up of such often lofty, ideal, but yet ultimately un-Platonic or even anti-Aristotle.",5,Ambition is Critical - Dylan Thomas,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,1821,"['prompt', 'check', 'online', 'encyclopaedia', 'website', 'Wikipedia', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'Megas', 'Alexandros', 'Greek', 'was', 'born', 'late', 'July', 'would', 'make', 'Leo.As', 'fellow', 'Leo', 'could', 'relate', 'ambitions', 'fiery', 'passions', 'Not', 'mention', 'zest', 'life', 'astrological', 'terms', 'Leo', 'zodiac', 'governed', 'sun', 'thus', 'philosophically', 'speaking', 'Alexander', 'driven', 'fire', 'doubt', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'references', 'made', 'course', 'movie', 'regards', 'looking', 'sky', 'thus', 'sun.Already', 'was', 'stated', 'movie', 'old', 'Ptlomey', 'played', 'reverence', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'not', 'exist', 'historians', 'particularly', 'Greek', 'ones', 'idolised', 'Made', 'more', 'man', 'made', 'demi-god', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'passed', 'legends', 'myths', 'Herakles', 'Achilles.For', 'more', 'contemporary', 'not', 'really', 'reliable', 'biographical', 'point', 'view', 'Plutarch', 'works', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'go', 'now', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'admirable', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'why', 'Americans', 'are', 'not', 'susceptible', 'such', 'films', 'Stone', 'mentioned', 'commentary', 'suspected', 'American', 'audiences', 'did', ""n't"", 'teaching', 'movies', 'modified', 'Aristotle', 'tutoring', 'scene', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'stated', 'audiences', 'could', 'not', 'count', 'years', 'B.C.However', 'such', 'facts', 'are', 'trivial', 'Stone', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'towering', 'achievements', 'Alexander', 'However', 'did', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'instance', 'Alexander', 'world', 'view', 'races', 'countries', 'can', 'be', 'united', 'one', 'system', 'be', 'language', 'governance', 'education', 'military', 'etc', 'point', 'admirable', 'let', 'alone', 'ancient', 'conqueror', 'could', 'have', 'dreamt', 'such', 'often', 'lofty', 'ideal', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'un-Platonic', 'even', 'anti-Aristotle']",Alexander

I've been a huge fan of epics, everything from Ben-Hur to Gladiator & Troy, and even King Arthur was entertaining.  I'm a fan of Colin, Jolie & Hopkins so I decided that Alexander, although bashed by every critic, would still be worth my time.  I'm sad to say I was wrong.  I feel that Oliver should have focused of the greater aspects of Alexanders life, like his rise to power, instead of throwing us into the middle of his reign and spending way too much time letting us know he would rather sleep with his friend (played way too femininely by Jared Leto) than his wife.  I felt the acting was lacking, all except Colin.  I felt he did very well.  I feel bad that he was bashed so much for this performance for I felt he was the only part of the movie that remained memerable.  I thought he deserved an oscar nod, although I would have chosen Johny Depp over Colin to walk away with the golden man.  The battle scenes were also very dissapointing.  First of all, you have a three hour movie about the most powerful warrior in the world and there are only about twenty minutes tops worth of battle time...thats just bad judgment on Oliver's part.  The battle scenes themselves were lacking.  The first against the Medes & Persians was a complete mess...the battle scenes in Troy were far superior as was the battle scene in the beginning of Gladiator.  The last scene with the Elephants was the most anticipated scene of the movie for me and it left me bitter.  It could have been sooooo much better.  I read that the battle scene was distroyed going through an x-ray and they were only able to salvage some of the battle, but still, it wouldn't have saved the movie from impending doom.  I don't feel I could watch it again.  The sex scene was steamy, in a funny, laugh out loud kinda way...

910169,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0009PLLN6,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 9]","So, according to Oliver Stone, who's never met a piece of history he didn't want to distort, Alexander the Great was a girly man crybaby who let his own men insult and belittle him throughout his whole quest for greatness. The very fact that Stone sensationalized the homosexual malarkey of his Alexander cut the rug out from under this film's feet before it ever hit theatres. Alexander the Great is a name that has resounded throughout history for over two millennia - but the history of that story somehow wasn't good enough for Stone. I think even Freud would shudder at the thought of someone who is not a psychologist or even an historian trying to psychoanalyze a man who died over three hundred years before the birth of Christ. It's unfortunate because this could have been a powerful film.Skipping back and forth across Alexander's life (Stone apparently thinks is a devilishly clever way to tell a story), we follow the great conqueror's story from his childhood to his death through the eyes of Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins). Born to Philip of Macedon and his exotic first wife Olympias (Angelina Jolie) -who claimed Alexander was the son of Zeus -Alexander (Colin Farrell) had a complicated childhood. Olympias groomed him to be the next king, worrying all the while that Philip would not recognize him as the legitimate heir. Interestingly, Olympias doesn't seem to age a day between Alexander's birth and his ascendancy to the throne at the age of nineteen. We're talking about Angelina Jolie here, so I couldn't get past the thought that this is an Oedipus complex just waiting to happen. Anyway, Alexander replaces his murdered father, sets off north to establish his control over the tribes there, and then just keeps heading east conquering everything that gets in his way. After his daring defeat of Persia's King Darius, he fights his way all the way into India, farther than anyone before him had ever gone. If he had known those Indian tribes had war elephants, I daresay Alexander might have just turned around at the border and headed back home early. Instead, his military exploits extend over seven years. We hear him talk about assimilating the conquered peoples, and he certainly likes to build Alexandrias all over the place, but this grand vision theme of Alexander's life doesn't get enough play in the movie to sufficiently explain his motives.The movie does have some strengths. The battle scenes are very impressive (except the end of the final one, when Stone decides to get artistic with it), especially Alexander's ill-fated fight with the elephant-equipped Indian tribes. Blood and guts are spilled on an epic scale. Angelina Jolie is mesmerizing as Alexander's devious, snake-loving mother - but I have no idea where that accent of hers was supposed to have come from. Speaking of strange accents, Colin Farrell sometimes sounded to me like he should have been leading Braveheart's forces. He never became Alexander in my eyes - there just wasn't enough substance to his character. If the film had been nothing but battle scenes, Farrell would have been more convincing; it's the scenes taking place between battles that leads this film astray. Most of this time is spent watching Alexander exchange meaningful glances with pretty boys wearing more makeup than Jezebel. The rest of the time consists of all those loyal men who supposedly adore their brave king whining about the length of the campaign, criticizing Alexander's motives and strategy, and making snide remarks about his heritage. There's no way Alexander the Great let his men talk to him the way they do throughout this film. There's really not much leadership on display by here. Alexander's brave, certainly, but he's no Patton.Basically, Oliver Stone does a great disservice to Alexander the Great, passing him off as a dandy with little strategic genius and even less control over men who supposedly loved and respected him enough to fight and die for him thousands of miles from home. Stone's characterization of Alexander is just plain weird - and that's the whole problem with this movie. Let's hope that the youth of today and tomorrow don't see this film and actually believe they're seeing an accurate picture of Alexander the Great because Stone's Alexander ain't all that great.",3,This Alexander ain't all that great,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,4291,"['So', 'according', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'who', 'never', 'met', 'piece', 'history', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'distort', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'was', 'girly', 'man', 'crybaby', 'who', 'let', 'own', 'men', 'insult', 'belittle', 'whole', 'quest', 'greatness', 'very', 'fact', 'Stone', 'sensationalized', 'homosexual', 'malarkey', 'Alexander', 'cut', 'rug', 'film', 'feet', 'ever', 'hit', 'theatres', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'name', 'resounded', 'history', 'two', 'millennia', 'history', 'story', 'somehow', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'Stone', 'think', 'even', 'Freud', 'would', 'shudder', 'thought', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'psychologist', 'even', 'historian', 'trying', 'psychoanalyze', 'man', 'who', 'died', 'three', 'hundred', 'years', 'birth', 'Christ', 'unfortunate', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'film.Skipping', 'back', 'forth', 'Alexander', 'life', 'Stone', 'apparently', 'devilishly', 'clever', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'follow', 'great', 'conqueror', 'story', 'childhood', 'death', 'eyes', 'Ptolemy', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Born', 'Philip', 'Macedon', 'exotic', 'first', 'wife', 'Olympias', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', '-who', 'claimed', 'Alexander', 'was', 'son', 'Zeus', '-Alexander', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'had', 'complicated', 'childhood', 'Olympias', 'groomed', 'be', 'next', 'king', 'worrying', 'while', 'Philip', 'would', 'not', 'recognize', 'legitimate', 'heir', 'Interestingly', 'Olympias', ""n't"", 'seem', 'age', 'day', 'Alexander', 'birth', 'ascendancy', 'throne', 'age', 'nineteen', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'thought', 'Oedipus', 'complex', 'just', 'waiting', 'happen', 'Anyway', 'Alexander', 'murdered', 'father', 'off', 'north', 'establish', 'control', 'tribes', 'there', 'then', 'just', 'keeps', 'heading', 'east', 'conquering', 'everything', 'way', 'daring', 'defeat', 'Persia', 'King', 'Darius', 'way', 'way', 'India', 'farther', 'anyone', 'had', 'ever', 'gone', 'had', 'known', 'Indian', 'tribes', 'had', 'war', 'elephants', 'daresay', 'Alexander', 'might', 'have', 'just', 'turned', 'around', 'border', 'headed', 'back', 'home', 'early', 'Instead', 'military', 'exploits', 'extend', 'seven', 'years', 'hear', 'talk', 'assimilating', 'conquered', 'peoples', 'certainly', 'build', 'Alexandrias', 'place', 'grand', 'vision', 'theme', 'Alexander', 'life', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'play', 'movie', 'sufficiently', 'explain', 'motives.The', 'movie', 'have', 'strengths', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'end', 'final', 'one', 'when', 'Stone', 'get', 'artistic', 'especially', 'Alexander', 'ill-fated', 'fight', 'elephant-equipped', 'Indian', 'tribes', 'Blood', 'guts', 'are', 'spilled', 'epic', 'scale', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'mesmerizing', 'Alexander', 'devious', 'snake-loving', 'mother', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'accent', 'hers', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'come', 'Speaking', 'strange', 'accents', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'sometimes', 'sounded', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'leading', 'Braveheart', 'forces', 'never', 'became', 'Alexander', 'eyes', 'there', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'substance', 'character', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'nothing', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Farrell', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'convincing', 'scenes', 'taking', 'place', 'battles', 'film', 'astray', 'Most', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'Alexander', 'exchange', 'meaningful', 'glances', 'pretty', 'boys', 'wearing', 'more', 'makeup', 'Jezebel', 'rest', 'time', 'loyal', 'men', 'who', 'supposedly', 'adore', 'brave', 'king', 'whining', 'length', 'campaign', 'criticizing', 'Alexander', 'motives', 'strategy', 'making', 'snide', 'remarks', 'heritage', 'way', 'Great', 'let', 'men', 'talk', 'way', 'do', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'leadership', 'display', 'here', 'Alexander', 'brave', 'certainly', 'Patton.Basically', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'great', 'disservice', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'passing', 'off', 'dandy', 'little', 'strategic', 'genius', 'even', 'less', 'control', 'men', 'who', 'supposedly', 'loved', 'respected', 'enough', 'fight', 'die', 'thousands', 'miles', 'home', 'Stone', 'characterization', 'Alexander', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'whole', 'problem', 'movie', 'Let', 'hope', 'youth', 'today', 'tomorrow', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'actually', 'believe', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'accurate', 'picture', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'ai', ""n't"", 'great']",Alexander
910170,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B0009PLLN6,Darren,"[0, 1]","I'm reviewing the Theatrical Cut available free on Prime.  Most reviews, particularly the positive ones, are extolling the virtues of Stone's ""Final Cut"" version of this movie, which apparently pushes close to the 4-hour mark.  But I can't imagine that another 45 minutes was entirely necessary, unless you're a great fan of the film -- in which case, More, not Less, is More, I suppose.  But even with this mere 3-hour Theatrical Cut, it seems to me that Stone accomplished what he set out to do.Which, of course, was to make an old-school Hollywood epic, with modern accoutrements like computer-generated imagery, about the life and achievements of one Iksander of Macedon, whom we know as Alexander the Great.  (The ""Al"", by the way, was a later addition to his name from the Arabic peoples he conquered in Iraq.)  Stone chooses to present Alexander to us in the manner of traditional Georgian and Victorian hagiographers, which is to say, as a brilliant general, unmatched in personal bravery, bringing ""civilization"" to the ""barbarians"" in the East.  A visionary who anticipated the Roman Empire by 200 years.  A man who single-handedly tried to weave the world anew into an amazing technicolor dreamcoat of perfectly blended cultures (with ""Greek"" being the main color, though, because it was the ""best"").  One love, one heart, let's get together and feel all right.  All of this is quite surprising coming from Stone, not a man known to embody Western-centric views, a director who has made a name for himself as an iconoclast prepared to annoy his audience in pursuit of his obsessive opinions.  Who knows, perhaps he thought that Alexander's relationship with Hephaistion would take care of the requisite controversy in what would be an otherwise conservative movie.  If he thought that, he was right ... as the male audiences who would normally see this movie stayed away in droves when it was released.  There was a collective ""Ew!"" when people heard that Colin Farrell and Jared Leto hugged each other a lot in the movie.  But this was almost a decade ago.  Today, with a third of the states in the union permitting same-sex marriage, this detail would hardly merit discussion.  Unfortunately for the studio's bottom line, Stone was ahead of his time.He was also ahead of his time in casting Angelina Jolie as Colin Farrell's Mom, Olympias.  If he made this movie today and cast Jolie in the same role, I don't think anyone would have minded.  Today she'a a Special Envoy for the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees.  She's battling personal health issues.  People like her today.  10 years ago, though, she was a particularly vampy Hollywood celeb who literally drove Billy Bob Thornton insane.  No one could believe her in a classical setting.  She was only two years older than the man who played her son.  And whoever decided that she should speak with an accent like Natasha Fatale made a serious error in judgment.  It was yet another thing to mock the movie about.  The only other two roles that matter are Alexander's Dad, Philip, and Alexander himself.  Both Val Kilmer and Colin Farrell acquit themselves perfectly well within the limits of their roles as written.So did Stone succeed in making a traditional Hollywood epic about a traditional Alexander the Great?  Yes.  Others here have commented that no one has yet to make a ""definitive"" movie about Alexander, but the problem with that criticism is that there IS no ""definitive"" Alexander.  Stone, along with many before him, seems to think that Alexander was a political and cultural visionary, and even within the confines of this very brief 3-hour Theatrical Cut, that point of view incessantly comes across through several long-winded speeches and through Alexander's own actions.  Aside from that, there are two thrilling battle scenes here that surpass other battle scenes in the various other films during the brief ""sword-and-sandal"" revival a decade ago inaugurated by Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"".  The battle at Gaugemela features pounding drums (great score by Vangelis, by the way), easy-to-follow battalion movements, and helpful title-cards showing us which flank we're viewing at any given moment.  And the jungle-battle in India features exciting war elephants stomping all over the bloody ground, and a whacked-out visual effect where all the trees are colored blood-red.  Cool beans.  Cool movie.  4 out of 5.By the way, if I made a movie about Alexander, he'd be portrayed as the mood-swinging child that he in fact was, lavishing gifts and praise to a courtier one moment, the next moment bawling with regret after committing some horrible atrocity on desert nomads.  Imagine a totalitarian dictatorship run by an 11-year-old boy -- that's my Alexander.  It's an Alexander too busy tramping all over the Earth in furtherance of his own personal glory to really be a statesman, despite any lip-service he might pay to creating a one-government, one-culture world.  Oh, and I would have spent a lot of time focusing on his later, fat, years, where he spent almost all of his waking hours in a drunken stupor.  See, all of that is also part of the ""definitive"" Alexander, but no one seems to want to make THAT movie.  A shame.  It might be kind of funny!",4,Alexander the Good Enough,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,5247,"[""'m"", 'reviewing', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'available', 'free', 'Prime', 'Most', 'reviews', 'particularly',

There are several spectacular scenes that perfectly show off the HD medium.However, I still cannot like this movie. My main problem is with Colin Farrell in the lead. He just does not come off as the charismatic leader the real Alexander was. His Irish brogue seems out of place, and he lacks the heroic quality required for the role. In his speech before the battle of Gaugemela, he attempts a ""Crispin's Day"" clarion call at the end of the speech that is so poor, my wife and I actually chuckled. The ""honeymoon scene"" with Rosario Dawson is equally inept. It was as if Stone had not written anything for the scene, and let the actors ""improv"" the scene. Dawson pushes and hits at Farrell, while Farrel hisses like a cat. Again, more unintentional humor.It seemed to me that Stone just could not produce a good script for this film, so it never gels. However, he shot in some great locations,and there is some fine CGI enhancement of some scenes. I find it worth watching for the visual impact, but for little else.

The man went out and basically took over a huge chunk of the known old world. He was one hell of a soldier and General. But He also wound up as a monster and a tryant who had lost his soul in the loneliness and madness of being an absolute monarch. Who was probadly was poisoned by his nobles in Bagdad as they were terrified of him.Also his conquest helped fianance the Hellenistic Age which established Greek Culture as one of the Pillars of Western Civilisation. That would of been nice to mention in the film. Or the establishment of that lovely city in Egypt with the nice library.But instead we get this dogs breakfast with some very good special effects. That basically said that he was Gay and incidentally kicked The Persian Empires butt. I have no problem with the established historical fact that he was either gay or bisexual or whatever. But there is a whole lot more to the story than just this.Like why did he do this all this fighting? (Avenge the Persian Invasion of Greece  a century before) Why did they drink like fish back then? (All soldiers drink to a greater or lessor degree)Why did Alexander kill his oldest ,best General and his family? (Because of raging insecurity after his pages tried to kill him) Why did the Army refuse to go into India? (It would of been nice to have one of the enlisted tell us why.

I stayed away from it.I now have seen the ""Special Edition Cut"". All I can say is that despite its gorgous production value, this film lacked a good screen play. The battle scenes were not that well executed in terms of music and sound, somtimes the music plays to loudly in these sequences that it took away the horror. I do not hold a Grudge against Vangelis he is a good composer but he should have let the battle sequence play themselves out (Think John Williams in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. He let those battle sequences play themselves out) and one more thing the second battle sequence (at Jhelum in present day Pakistan) was historically inaccurate (I know this is Hollywood but still) Alexander was not wounded there He was wounded at Multan (also in present day Pakistan)and Alexander's horse died of illness not in battle.Acting wise Colin Ferrell's Alexander acts much more like a child then a young King. I don't blame Ferrell he is a good actor I blame the writers If that was the REAL Alexander Then God help us.Jolie's Olympias acting wise is a bit spotty.

910185,A2Y5GF89TH8KEY,B0009PLLN6,"Diotima ""Mantinea""","[3, 4]","According to the French-Swiss film director, Jean-Luc Godard: ""A story should have a beginning, a middle and an end - but not necessarily in that order!""  It has become commonplace for a film to start at the end, go back to the beginning and then proceed chronologically to the end of the story.  But Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" starts at the end, goes to the middle, and then flip-flops back and forth until it finally catches up with the end.  Thus there are not only flashbacks but also flash-forwards.Classicists will easily spot the historical gaffes and misquotes.

910187,A22U9OGGOTFW85,B0009PLLN6,"Donald C. Renfro ""Don""","[9, 11]","""First of all before I get to my review, let me say this movie is absolute garbage.  There should be a prison were directors who make ridiculous and absurd biographical movies should have to watch ""Ishtar"" everday at least 10 times a day as punishment.""  Having said that, on with the review.Since we really don't have much to go on as far as factual historical accounts of Alexander, we can only surmise our image of him from what little there is written about him. We know a lot about what he accomplished because the results are evident, but trying to put together a portrait of his ""true"" character and nature is at best just hypothetical conjecture. No one knows who Alexander really was as a person. Most people don't even know themselves.Does this movie convey Alexander as he really was or just some Hollywood director's personal idea that has been gleaned from rehashed biographies of Alexander. From the ridiculous Harold Lamb version to the account of Arrian to the excellent ""The Generalship of Alexander the Great"" by Major General J.F.C. Fuller (which if you want to seriously learn something about Alexander, you should read) there isn't much that can be added to what scant information we have. Certainly the life of Alexander is a mystery since there is virtually nothing known about it, and what little is know wasn't even included in the film.For example, his leading the cavalry charge at the ""Battle of Chaeronea"" which resulted in Philip's hegemony of Greece wasn't ever mentioned in the movie. Instead, sensual garbage including his mother's fetish with snakes and her completely embellished influence on him, in the usual Hollywood manner, is the kind of rubbish that is fostered upon the viewer.Obviously, his mother had and influence on him as all mothers have an influence on their children, but ""give me a break"". This kind of theatrical emoting is a waste of screen time which should have been spent on showing us what Alexander did in his life, which is what made him ""The Great"".Almost all of the significant things he did are not even mentioned or so quickly glossed over that they are meaningless. And a lot of what is mentioned isn't even correct. And many of the conclusions made by the director are purely guesswork, and bad guesswork at that.Another example of something significant left out of the movie in favor of snake slithering: At the age 16 Alexander was entrusted with the regency of Macedonia while Philip was sieging Perinthos and Byzantium in eastern Thrace. While his father was gone, the Maedi, a Thracian tribe, revolted. Alexander led a campaign against them, succeeded, and established a new colony at Maedi and named it Alexandros. He was also allowed to be referred to as a ""man"" after that, because he had killed an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, and that was the only way a Macadonian could be considered a ""man"".At that time Alexander was able to start having an insight and true understanding of his father which could have only been attained from the battle field. It was possible to comprehend his father's harsh, disciplined life which included drinking, hunting, and loving.The rest of Alexander's life was just as remarkable as his exploit in suppressing the uprising at Maedi, but the movie, in my opinion, just doesn't do justice to Alexander. A man who did what he did and in such a short time deserves better. And quite frankly, except for the poorly done battle scenes, I've seen more action in ""Road Runner"" cartoons.One final example which wasn't even hinted at in the movie: On his march back ""home"", he encountered the ""Mallians"", a fierce and warring nation. An assault was made on their major stronghold, and the men with the scaling ladders were late arriving. Alexander, with his impatience to storm the fortress, grabbed a ladder from the first ladder bearer to arrive and personally placed it against the wall and climbed up. Three other men followed him up the ladder and made the top with him. The men on the ground scrambled to follow Alexander, and their combined weight broke the ladder, and the king and the three soldiers were stranded on top of the battlements. The men on the ground pleaded for him to jump back down into their arms and safety, but Alexander jumped into the fort and attacked. He received a serious chest wound but not before dispatching several of the Mallians. The army broke into the stronghold, and thinking Alexander dead, killed everyone there. That's the kind of man that this movie should have been telling the story of, not some jickjack Jollie snake juggling mishmash of psychological meanderings that were a complete bore.Alexander was a man of action, a great leader and general, a genius of military strategy and tactics, a philosopher, musician, had schooling in botany, astronomy, medicine, geography, and other various disciplines and he was a hero in the ""grand tradition"". Maybe Peter Jackson should make a movie about Alexander. I'm sure he could get it ""right"".",1,THIS IS NOT ALEXANDER!!!!!!!!,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,4986,"['First', 'get', 'review', 'let', 'say', 'movie', 'absolute', 'garbage', 'should', 'be',

In most cases, it takes pretty much the standard epic biography line, with the addition of the bi-sexuality that C.B. DeMille would never have been permitted to show, much as he would have liked to do so, if it were possible under Hayes Office rules. The Oedipal situation is also given more overt presence than would have passed the censors in the heyday of Biblical (and other historical) epics. On the positive side, the battle scenes were well done cinematically, with the use of elephants being particularly striking. (I believe the disciplined formations of elephants shown in the film is historically inaccurate, the elephant proving to have too unruly in combat to be an effective weapon). I have no complaint about historical inaccuracies when it comes to entertainment vehicles.While the director makes a good faith effort to account for the driving ambition in a man seeking to conquer the known universe (as  portrayed in the film) I could not help but feel that the motivations of so complex a many are nearly impossible to capture in a period more than a millennium past. However, the director does a good job of delineating a motivational base adequate to the needs of the film.Most of the actors filled their roles adequately, historical drama being a notorious burial ground for even the best of actors. The lead showed too little charisma, no personal fault involved,  this being a mostccomplicated man he had to play. Mostly, when an actor failed, it appeared to have been a consequence of the script.So, over-all I did not find this to be a particularly exciting film, but it was interesting.

I would love to be able to brag to people how wonderful & well done it was.  Unfortunately, I cannot ethically do any of the above.First a little on me.  I have studied the life of Alexander of Macedon for the past 15 years.  I've read books and essays on his life, including the biography by Arrian. I wrote a term paper on his life while in college.  I own several documentaries on his life.  I have studied the background facts of Greek culture extensively.  As I mentioned, I should have loved this movie  & in fact I wanted to love it.Now a little on the movie.  Somehow, it just didn't work.  Colin Farrell is a good cast for Alexander and most of the acting is decent.  The battle scenes are impressive and the soundtrack is pretty good (fittingly written by a Greek - Vangelis).  However, in the end it falls short of being worthwhile, and not even Sir Anthony Hopkins appearing as the elderly Ptolemy can change this fact.The basic problem with the film is that it's.....well.....boring (and my it pains me to say that!).  That a movie on Alexander's life would take 3+ hours to pull off is not surprising.  Unfortunately, this is 3+ hours of rather dull cinema.  The movie will have a spectacular battle scene and then get bogged down by some rather inconsequential aspects of Alexander's life.  Sadly, it seems to go on & on & on with some of these footnote elements.There are a few scenes here & there that are well done.  And, there are also some anecdotes of his life that happened kinda / sorta the way they appear in the film.  It's accurate that Alexander was bi-sexual too, but it's not necessary to hammer this fact over the head of the audience.In the end, if you're fascinated by the life of Alexander, this film is maybe worth seeing - once.  If not, you will probably walk out of this film thinking that his life was dull and ho-hum.  That is just too bad.  If you want to see a well-done movie on the ancient Greeks, see TROY.  It was everything this film lacked.If you are interested in the life of Alexander, but don't want to sit through a boring movie, I'd recommend IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ALEXANDER by Michael Wood (available on DVD from Amazon.com).

910193,A1GARI2JT6EAWA,B0009PLLN6,"DWD's Reviews ""DWD's Reviews""","[83, 95]","20 minutes into this movie I was thinking that it had real potential. We get to see the ugly details of Alexander's childhood. We get an understanding of his need to conquer, the need to achieve more than his father and his fascination for the non-Greek world (thanks to his mother).An hour into the movie I was confused and disappointed. Confused because of the incessant flashbacks. I knew what was going only because I teach this stuff for a living.How could the average movie-goer possibly understand why Alexander invaded the Persian Empire based on the feeble information supplied by Stone? Stone has an oblique reference to Phillip's murder, but the average movie-viewer does not know even know who Alexander the Great is, let alone that his father was murdered(he shows it in detail in a flashback - at the end of the movie - so the uninformed viewer will stay confused for nearly 2 more hours). A casual viewer might think that Alexander invaded Persia because he was following an eagle, since it was used so much in this battle scene (and mostly dropped for the rest of the movie).On an historical note, I think it is disingenious to blame the entire invasion on Alexander's need for revenge when the Greeks and the Persians had been fighting off and on again for nearly 2 centuries before Alexander's invasion finally put an end to it. Stone ignores all of that history and puts it all on Alexander(In my opinion, Stone is looking for conspiracies again -shades of 'JFK')My disappointment stemmed from the casual skipping of most of Alexander's campaigns - from the destruction of the Persian navy to the conquering of the unconquerable Tyre to the Egyptians and their declaring him a god - all was covered in one paragraph from Ptolemey. One of the greatest military campaigns in all of history - possibly the greatest of all - dismissed like it was just so much garbage in the way of the true story.***Note to Oliver Stone - the difference between Alexander the Great and every other mentally disturbed egomaniac with a Messiah complex, an abusive father and an over-protective mother with a snake fetish is those battles. They made him 'The Great!'  Dismissing them with a wave of Ptolemy's hand over an ancient map is disrespectful to the story and to the viewer!Stone's battle sequences are busy, noisy and confusing. Those are appropriate adjectives for any movie's battle scenes. However, they are also cold, distant and fail to convey the true genius that Alexander had as a battlefield commander. This is where it would have been useful to include those early campaigns - to show the viewer that Alexander was flexible, ruthless, personally brave and in many ways the ideal of a soldier and a general. He comes close when he shows Alexander speaking to the men before the Battle at Granicus. He alludes to a common history, but the viewer knows nothing of it and really cares very little for the people invlolved. Mostly, it's 10 minutes of Alexander riding his horse very fast.Oliver Stone's re-creation of Babylon is very nice. He does a good job of showing Alexander's fascination with Asian culture and of demonstrating the tension between his desire for a united Greek-Asian empire and his men's desire to just take Asia's riches and return home to Macedon.However, there's almost no development of the supporting cast of Macedonian characters. Alexander's male love interest has one main scene while they are in Asia and otherwise lurks in the shadows with sultry looks for Alexander. His men just become a part of the scenery so there is little emotional punch when Alexander starts to kill them off for mutiny.The constant flashbacks were irritating. Some might think that they are sophisticated. I think they were insulting. Stone shows Phillip accusing his men of disloyalty in a flashback and then show Alexander doing the same. He shows Phillip bringing in a second wife in a flashback and then shows Alexander ignoring his wife in favor of his boyfriend. Phillip's second wife is dealt with as is the boyfriend. Phillip is assassinated as is Alexander (historically shaky...) Are we too stupid to make these connections without having them paired up for us in back-to-back scenes?!?For those that blame the failure of this movie on Alexander's bisexuality and America's prudishness I would say that as a history teacher in America, not 1 American in 100 knows who Alexander the Great was, let alone knowing his sexual preferences. Rather, what everyone heard was that it was a long, bad movie.Too bad that Oliver Stone took this topic that was so rich in potential for a great movie and ruined it for this generation of movie-goers. I suppose we'll have to wait for 20 more years before someone will be able to get the financing to try again and do it right.",1,"A review from a history teacher who focuses on Greece, Rome and the

910196,AH0K6KAO3N1RH,B0009PLLN6,E. Dolnack,"[6, 10]","I really enjoyed Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"". I think it's a fine film. There are some very well filmed segments in this movie. Overall, it may not end up being seen as a filmatic masterpiece, but there are portions of this movie that are very good.I particularly liked the scene of Aristotle teaching the young Macedonian boys geography. It's a well acted scene. Both the aged Aristotle and the child actors do a fine job. If you listen close, the lecture that Aristotle gives is politically-incorrect by today's standards. A lesser film would have shied away from this and either not shown such sentiments, or toned them down somewhat, but let's be honest, Aristotle was politically-incorrect by today's values and this film does a good job in portraying historical accuracy, not revisionist history.I think Alexander's tirade about the Macedonian generals' show of contempt for a world ""far older than their's"" is kind of wishful thinking on Oliver Stone's part however. I'm sure the historical Alexander, (as a Greek speaking man), would have felt himself quite superior to Asiatic cultures and peoples.The actual battle(s) over India are also incorrect in that in reality the Macedonians were not massacred by the Indians as shown in the film, but rather could have probably conquered all of India had they continued. The breakdown of morale in the commanding general staff is shown in the film as taking place before the Indian invasion when indeed this happened well within India at a later time. Alexander only ""lost"" when his generals refused to carry on eastward. If he was ever defeated, it was only by low internal morale amongst his own troops. For some reason that escapes historic accuracy, Oliver Stone makes the Indians in his film far stronger a foe than they were in history.Other than these few historical flaws, the film is quite good by modern standards. The dance of Roxanne in Bactria is a quite erotic and passionately filmed sequence. The confused sexual tension between Alexander and Hephaistion is also quite convincing and well acted onscreen.The musical score by Vangelis is haunting and beautiful, as are all of his scores.At first, I had my doubts about Collin Farrell in the lead role, but he's convincing as Alexander. Also, children who play the young character in a film rarely seem like they'd grow up into the actors that play the same character as an adult. Case in point, the young 9-year-old boy Anakin Skywalker of ""Phantom Menace"" does not at all seem that he would grow into the Anakin that we see in Episodes II and III of the Star Wars Saga. In Alexander, the boy Alexander actually seems plausible that he'd grow into Collin Farrell as an adult.",4,Good Movie - Fine DVD,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,2691,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'think', 'fine', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'filmed', 'segments', 'movie', 'Overall', 'may', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'seen', 'filmatic', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'portions', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'good.I', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scene', 'Aristotle', 'teaching', 'young', 'Macedonian', 'geography', 'well', 'acted', 'scene', 'aged', 'Aristotle', 'child', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'listen', 'close', 'lecture', 'Aristotle', 'politically-incorrect', 'today', 'standards', 'lesser', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'shied', 'away', 'not', 'shown', 'such', 'sentiments', 'toned', 'down', 'somewhat', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'Aristotle', 'was', 'politically-incorrect', 'today', 'values', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'not', 'revisionist', 'history.I', 'think', 'Alexander', 'tirade', 'Macedonian', 'generals', 'show', 'contempt', 'world', 'far', 'older', 'kind', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'part', 'however', ""'m"", 'sure', 'historical', 'Alexander', 'Greek', 'speaking', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'quite', 'superior', 'Asiatic', 'cultures', 'peoples.The', 'actual', 'battle', 'India', 'are', 'also', 'incorrect', 'reality', 'Macedonians', 'were', 'not', 'massacred', 'Indians', 'shown', 'film', 'rather', 'could', 'have', 'probably', 'conquered', 'India', 'had', 'continued', 'breakdown', 'morale', 'commanding', 'general', 'staff', 'shown', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'Indian', 'invasion', 'when', 'indeed', 'happened', 'well', 'India', 'later', 'time', 'Alexander', 'only', 'lost', 'when', 'generals', 'refused', 'carry', 'eastward', 'was', 'ever', 'defeated', 'was', 'only', 'low', 'internal', 'morale', 'amongst', 'own', 'troops', 'reason', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Indians', 'film', 'far', 'stronger', 'foe', 'were', 'history.Other', 'few', 'historical', 'flaws', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'modern', 'standards', 'dance', 'Roxanne', 'Bactria', 'quite', 'erotic', 'passionately', 'filmed', 'sequence', 'confused', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Alexander', 'Hephaistion', 'also', 'quite', 'convincing', 'well', 'acted', 'onscreen.The', 'musical', 'score', 'Vangelis', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'are', 'scores.At', 'first', 'had', 'doubts', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'lead', 'role', 'convincing', 'Alexander', 'Also', 'children', 'who', 'play', 'young', 'character', 'film', 'rarely', 'seem', ""'d"", 'grow', 'up', 'actors', 'play', 'same', 'character', 'adult', 'Case', 'point', 'young', '9-year-old', 'boy', 'Anakin', 'Skywalker', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'not', 'seem', 'would', 'grow', 'Anakin', 'see', 'Episodes', 'II', 'III', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Saga', 'Alexander', 'boy', 'Alexander', 'actually', 'plausible', ""'d"", 'grow', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'adult']",Alexander
910197,A2W0BVGUDIX4AJ,B0009PLLN6,EGeraldhuebner,"[2, 3]","Hinweis: meine alte Rezension vom 15.06.2006 umgeschrieben, - und sie betrifft nun ausschlie&szlig;lich die verl&auml;ngerte Revisited - Director's (Final Cut) Fassung dieses Filmes, - ""Alexander"" von Oliver Stone, - volle 5 Sterne daf&uuml;r ...betrifft: Alexander - Revisited, Director's (Final Cut), DVD, deutsche Auflagena, herzlichen Dank, (keine Rezension mehr zur deutschen DVD Auflage m&ouml;glich)Am 15.06.06 &auml;u&szlig;erte ich mich  - relativ kurz - zur ""Alexander"" Einzel - DVD.Zugegeben, der Film war (nicht nur mir, sondern eben vielen), so, - in der Form, wie er allein damals zu bekommen war, halt gek&uuml;rzt, nicht mehr Kommentar wert.Nun, wollte ich aber auf die viel l&auml;ngere Fassung eingehen, und ... kann es nicht. A*** hat, ""genial"", wie sie nun mal sind, aus verkaufsstrategischen Gr&uuml;nden diese alte Rezension von damals zur Single Disc von mir nun dort stehen.Ich habe also - angeblich - schon l&auml;ngst was zur Revisited - Fassung getippt ! (nach deren Logik), kann also h&ouml;chstens noch meine alte &auml;ndern ... was ich nun werde.Mu&szlig; das nun auch revidieren, denn, inzwischen halte ich diesen Film f&uuml;r ein zu Unrecht gescholtenes, kleines ""Meisterwerk"".Nicht nur, das die Director's Cut - Version im Unterschied zur alten Kinofassung viel l&auml;nger ist [Laufzeit, gesamt, des Films, nun: 204, 50 Min. - davor waren es gerade mal 168,11 Min. (dh. 160, 42 - ohne den Abspann) ... durch die ganzen, neuen Umschnitte und das einf&uuml;gen neuer Szenen ergibt dieser Film hier n&auml;mlich, nun endlich ein richtig gutes Gesamtwerk.Ich w&uuml;nschte, ich k&ouml;nnte anderen bzw. mir selbst &uuml;berhaupt richtig erkl&auml;ren, was nun genau mich damals schon an der alten Kinofassung so gefesselt hat, das ich ihn mir zwar nie kaufte, trotzdem nicht mehr ganz aus dem Kopf bekam.Nach durchsehen des sehr hilfreichen Schnittberichtes dann, entschloss ich mich einfach kurzerhand, ihn mir sp&auml;ter in dieser vorliegenden Form doch zu kaufen.So sah damals meine alte Rezension dazu aus:nicht jeder Regisseur hat ""goldene H&auml;nde""... Fakt ist: Wo Ridley Scott (der ja sonst auch &ouml;fter's ganz andere Themen verfilmt) mit ""Gladiator"" weit weniger Schwierigkeiten hatte, - ist bei Olive Stone hier unzweifelhaft festzustellen, das er sich wohl doch besser weiterhin mit ""Anti"" - Kriegfilmen (""Platoon"") oder seinen Politdramen (""JFK - Tatort Dallas"", ""Nixon"") h&auml;tte besch&auml;ftigen sollen, - da dort wahrscheinlich doch viel eher sein wahres Talent zu finden ist !?""Alexander"" ist zwar rein handwerklich durchaus nicht schlecht gemacht, auch an den Leistungen der hochkar&auml;tigen Schauspieler Collin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer usw., ist nichts ernsthaftes auszusetzen (mit Sicherheit um L&auml;ngen besser als fr&uuml;here Verfilmungen dieses heiklen Thema's), - eine wirklich mitreissende ""Stimmung"" kommt im Vergleich zu anderen History Streifen dabei aber trotzdem irgendwie nicht so richtig auf.Sehr ungl&uuml;cklich gew&auml;hlt war hier auch der Versuch, mit sogenannten ""unterstreichenden"" Effekten a la ""Three Kings"" oder absichtlich das Bild verfremdenten Farbfiltern, wie es z.B. bei ""der Soldat James Ryan"" gemacht wurde (Gelb - bzw. - Rotstich Farbschleiern f&uuml;r besondere epische Schlachtszenen u.a.) eine gewisse dramaturgische Wirkung zu erzielen.Zur Verteidigung des Films muss aber auch gesagt werden, das sich, was oft bei anderen nicht immer der Fall ist, so gut es m&ouml;glich war, ziemlich exakt an die historisch bekannten Fakten gehalten (""K&ouml;nigreich der Himmel"" ist ebenfalls eines der besseren Beispiele daf&uuml;r) wurde.Durch die eigentlich &uuml;berfl&uuml;ssigen Diskussionen im Vorfeld um Alexanders moralische Neigungen o.&auml;. hatte dieser Film (wie auch z.B. ""die Passion Christi"") sowieso einen schweren Start gehabt und es fiel somit schwer, &uuml;bertriebene Erwartungen zu erf&uuml;llen.Fazit: Nicht nur f&uuml;r Geschichtsfans zu empfehlen, - wer grossz&uuml;gig &uuml;ber einige ""Patzer"" hinwegsehen kann, wird auch hier noch bestimmt gut unterhalten werden.Nachtrag:Auch wenn ich dem Film, mehr als zumindest die mei&szlig;ten hier, damals schon sehr vers&ouml;nlich gegen&uuml;ber geblieben bin, mu&szlig; ich nun trotzdem zugeben ...Ich habe dem Regisseur selbst und besonders seinem Film ein wenig unrecht getan.Denn ""Alexander"" ist einfach derma&szlig;en, von vorne herein durch die Kritik zerissen worden (und als quasi ""Todessto&szlig;"" f&uuml;r ihn kommen jetzt erst recht noch die Schnitte von fr&uuml;her hier dazu), da&szlig; er kaum eine Chance hatte, jemanden auf Anhieb richtig zu &uuml;berzeugen.Sogar die deutsche Synchronisation ist stimmig, lesen sie es selbst nach (Wikipedia). Im englischen Original hat Collin Farrell einen irischen, - Angelina Jolie daf&uuml;r einen russischen Akzent. Das ist zwar auch weniger ein Punkt zur Kritik, denn, in der Originalfassung versuchte Oliver Stone damit n&auml;mlich auch, die unterschiedlichen Kulturen durch unterschiedliche Dialekte darzustellen. Trotzdem bin ich der Meinung, - hat man als Zuschauer im Kopf, das alle Griechen bzw. Makedonier darstellen sollen, verwirrt einen sowas reichlich. Also ist es sogar besser, wenn rein deutsch &uuml;bersetzt wird.Auch, ist es mir im Grunde ehrlich gesagt ziemlich egal (gewesen), - dh. nicht nur jetzt, im nachhinein, sondern eigentlich schon damals, als dieser Film das erste mal erschien, ob Alexander der Gro&szlig;e nun homosexuell oder zumindest, das, was wir heute als bisexuell bezeichnen w&uuml;rden (denn er hatte ja einige Geliebte, also Frauen und er zeugte hier auch mit h&ouml;chster Wahrscheinlichkeit seinen Sohn selbst) war.Man darf nicht vergessen, das sowas damals im alten Griechenland durchaus &uuml;blich, ja, sogar erw&uuml;nscht war. Es ist eben ein gro&szlig;er Denkfehler (soll hei&szlig;en, ich selbst schlie&szlig;e mich hier garnicht mal aus !), der Leute, alles mit den heutigen Wertvorstellungen bzw. solchen ""Augen"" kritisch zu betrachten.Und zur Faktentreue bzw. historischen (Un)Genauigkeit, - zitiere ich nun einfach mal einen Auszug aus dem Netz, kopiere hier einige Beispiele f&uuml;r Fehler bzw. &Auml;nderungen, die so nat&uuml;rlich - bewie&szlig;enerma&szlig;en falsch - im Film sp&auml;ter vorkommen:1. Aristoteles zeigt anhand eines Fu&szlig;bodenmosaiks seinen Sch&uuml;lern die damals bekannte Welt. Dieses Mosaik jedoch enth&auml;lt die lateinische, nicht die griechische Schrift. Auch Ptolemaios I. zeigt eine Landkarte, die lateinische Begriffe enth&auml;lt. In beiden F&auml;llen w&auml;re aufgrund der ansonsten bereits recht wirklichkeitsgetreuen Darstellung der Landkarten beziehungsweise aufgrund der Dialoge der Mittelmeerraum und der Nahe Osten auch trotz einer schriftlichen Sprachbarriere erkennbar gewesen. Zu Zeiten Alexanders war die lateinische Sprache und Schrift in den &ouml;stlichen Mittelmeergebieten nicht verbreitet und konnte sich dann selbst in der r&ouml;mischen Kaiserzeit nur als Amtssprache, nicht aber als Intellektuellensprache durchsetzen. Ebenso sind jegliche Inschriften und lesbare Briefe, trotz keilschriftartiger Buchstaben, im Film auf Englisch gehalten, obwohl deren Verst&auml;ndnis nicht wichtig f&uuml;r die Handlung ist.2. Aus Gr&uuml;nden der filmischen Dramaturgie wurden Ereignisse an einen anderen Ort verlegt beziehungsweise an einen anderen Zeitpunkt. So wurde Alexander der Gro&szlig;e nicht in der Schlacht am Hydaspes durch einen Pfeil schwer verwundet, sondern bei der Belagerung von Multan, als er sich angeblich alleine dem gesamten feindlichen Heer stellte, bis ihm seine Truppen zu Hilfe eilten. Im Anschluss dieser Verletzung fasst Alexander im Film selbst den Beschluss zur Umkehr, nach der antiken &Uuml;berlieferung kam es hingegen nach der Schlacht am Hydaspes zu einer Meuterei, weshalb er zur Umkehr gezwungen war. Anders als sein historisches Vorbild ist Stones Alexander daher weitgehend frei von Hybris und Gr&ouml;&szlig;enwahn.3. Besonders f&uuml;r Kindheit und Privatleben Alexanders st&uuml;tzt sich das Drehbuch offensichtlich nicht auf den allgemein recht zuverl&auml;ssigen Geschichtsschreiber Arrian, sondern auf die von Legenden und Anekdoten durchsetzte Alexanderbiographie des Philosophen Plutarch. So findet sich im Film vieles, was zwar in einer antiken Quelle so oder &auml;hnlich berichtet wird, was aber von den meisten Wissenschaftlern l&auml;ngst als Fiktion enttarnt worden ist. Alles in allem entspricht der Film eher dem Forschungsstand der 1960er Jahre als dem seiner Entstehungszeit.Fazit (nun zum 2. und diemal anschlie&szlig;enden male), ich kann den Film jedem, in der nun verl&auml;ngerten Form, so nur w&auml;rmstens empfehlen, - es ist ein Film (!), kein Geschichtsbuch. Wer sich &uuml;ber das echte Leben Alexander's richtig informieren m&ouml;chte, mu&szlig; sich halt auch die M&uuml;he machen, dar&uuml;ber zu lesen.Und f&uuml;r solche (j&uuml;ngere Jahrg&auml;nge) Menschen, die immer noch glauben, ""der Soldat James Ryan"" z.B. zeigt - verglichen jetzt mal hierzu - dagegen auch nur halbwegs glaubw&uuml;rdige Geschichte, sei noch angemerkt: durch die Umschnitte, kommt die historische Schlacht Alexander's gegen Dareios III., also gegen das persische Gro&szlig;reich, stattgefunden am 1. Oktober im Jahre 331 vor Christus, bei Gaugamela nun auch viel fr&uuml;her hier im Film vor.Nicht so sch&ouml;n ist, das es kaum weitere, erw&auml;hnenswerte Extra's auf dieser Revisited Fassung - DVD gibt, und, das ganze auch nicht besonders aufgemacht wurde. Sie erhalten beim Kauf lediglich ein einfaches Amary Case. Hier h&auml;tte schon etwas der Neuauflage angemessenes ""drin"" sein d&uuml;rfen.",5,Korrektur bzw. &Auml;nderung meiner Rezension vom 15.06.2006 ! ! !,1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,9674,"['Hinweis',

910198,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0009PLLN6,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 3]","At this stage, one can only add a silly two cents' worth regarding Oliver Stone's finest film ALEXANDER (2004). One thing that strikes me is how hard it is to recall this film is only six years old. It seems like something out of the 1990s now.This film as historical novelization is, in a word, pure Stone. I love the depth and detail Stone powers into the audience here: close-ups of the Persians is a good example, as is his closing shots of classical images of Alexander including a statue of the Buddha (made first by Greeks and no doubt bearing Alexander's face). I love how Sir Anthony Hopkins (Ptolemy in old age, as the Pharaoh Ptolemy) refers to him in proper Greek, as ""Megas Alexandros"".Its two hour and forty-some-odd minutes running time is tiresome only in two areas: I do not like excessively operatic acting/music injected where it is not needed, and I do not like drawn-out, confusing battle scenes. Adding slo-mo as Stone loves to do so often does not help matters.What I do love is Colin Farrell as Alexander, silly Irish accent and all. (They even had Connor Paolo, as the young Alexander, beef up the Irish so he'd ""fit"" with Colin). Lordy, how he was mocked when this film was first released. Who the hell is Colin Farrell? What's with the Irish accent? Yet people mocked his bleached hair, so we did know him a little, after all. Well, my take on it is that it is Farrell's finest hour. He'd never reach this level of acting again.Actually, 'the Irish' gets even more annoying as Louisiana-born Jared Leto (as Alexander's boyfriend Hephaistion) puts on the blarney as well. I guess Stone figured to hell with it, let the Irish accent imply Macedonian heritage. And if I'm not in error, at least one Scots as well...let the Greeks talk British English. Only Val Kilmer as Alexander's father King Filipos [Phillip] managed to keep some reasonable distance from over-indulgence. I cannot fathom why Stone had the other actors speaking with silly accents...when they spoke at all.Anyway, with that off my chest, I have a couple of personal angles to approach with this film. While I love the unabashed showing of Alexander and Hephaistion's relationship as man-and-husband, it is to Stone's eternal shame that he did not have the courage to show it all properly. He did not shy away from Alexander's near-rape of his Persian wife ""Roxane"" (the eternally annoying Rosario Dawson). I might commend him on his beautiful display of the gorgeous Francisco Bosch as Alexander's male concubine Bagoas--yet the studios forced Stone to cut the lovemaking scenes between the men. It amounted to a half hour of footage.It was revolting to me the way Stone ultimately reduced the Greeks, Persians and Aryans to cardboard cut-out figures. Maybe he wanted us to see them the way Macedonians saw them, but I think it was pure laziness. The odd comparison Stone seems to make between Indians and monkeys made my blood boil. Maybe that's just me, but it looked fairly obvious.Christopher Plummer, in his cameo as Aristotle, was a delight and I loved seeing their map of the world as he taught young Alexander. I must also make a special mention of the great Elliot Cowan as young Ptolemy, because he is a believable young Anthony Hopkins--not easy! The last time that was tried was in THE HUMAN STAIN by young and beautiful Wentworth Miller in 2003--and it failed.Jared Leto deserves massive kudos. I know he's a weirdo and no one seems to like him anymore, but he's brash, he's beautiful and he can act his little heinie off here. The way he bores into Colin's eyes with his...love is in the air. Not just anyone can do that. I've heard Leto say he's ""asexual"" in real life and I know he's had fake gal pals and has a daughter. But that boy is GAY.Vangelis' score, though a bit too lush during battle scenes, is spot-on...I only wish there had been less of it and less volume. An operatic film like this, with its mad scene-chewing, is made worse only by equally operatic music. Ah well. It's film, not history class!I hope I will be forgiven for giving the names of the other actors a bit of a miss here. Go to the Internet Movie Database if you're that anxious to know. I don't see they deserve singling out since this film couldn't help the career of the brave and beautiful Francisco Bosch. There can be no denying it: either you'll despise every second of this film or you'll adore it in a general way. It's a lot better than the miserable TROY, I can tell you that.",4,"With so many beauties, how is Colin supposed to choose a girl?",1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,4475,"['stage', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'add', 'silly', 'two', 'cents', 'worth', 'regarding', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'finest', 'film', 'ALEXANDER', '2004', 'One', 'thing', 'how', 'hard', 'recall', 'film', 'only', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'something', '1990s', 'now.This', 'film', 'historical', 'novelization', 'word', 'pure', 'Stone', 'love', 'depth', 'detail', 'Stone', 'powers', 'audience', 'here', 'close-ups', 'Persians', 'good', 'example', 'closing', 'shots', 'classical', 'images', 'Alexander', 'including', 'statue', 'Buddha', 'made', 'first', 'Greeks', 'doubt', 'bearing', 'Alexander', 'face', 'love', 'how', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ptolemy', 'old', 'age', 'Pharaoh', 'Ptolemy', 'refers', 'proper', 'Greek', 'Megas', 'Alexandros', '.Its', 'two', 'hour', 'forty-some-odd', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'tiresome', 'only', 'two', 'areas', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'excessively', 'operatic', 'acting/music', 'injected', 'where', 'not', 'needed', 'do', 'not', 'drawn-out', 'confusing', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Adding', 'slo-mo', 'Stone', 'do', 'so', 'often', 'not', 'help', 'matters.What', 'do', 'love', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Alexander', 'silly', 'Irish', 'accent', 'even', 'had', 'Connor', 'Paolo', 'young', 'Alexander', 'beef', 'up', 'Irish', ""'d"", 'fit', 'Colin', 'Lordy', 'how', 'was', 'mocked', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Who', 'hell', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'What', 'Irish', 'accent', 'people', 'mocked', 'bleached', 'hair', 'did', 'know', 'little', 'Well', 'take', 'Farrell', 'finest', 'hour', ""'d"", 'never', 'reach', 'level', 'acting', 'again.Actually', 'Irish', 'even', 'more', 'annoying', 'Louisiana-born', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Alexander', 'boyfriend', 'Hephaistion', 'blarney', 'as', 'well', 'guess', 'Stone', 'figured', 'hell', 'let', 'Irish', 'accent', 'imply', 'Macedonian', 'heritage', ""'m"", 'not', 'error', 'least', 'one', 'Scots', 'as', 'well', 'let', 'Greeks', 'talk', 'British', 'English', 'Only', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Alexander', 'father', 'King', 'Filipos', '[', 'Phillip', ']', 'managed', 'keep', 'reasonable', 'distance', 'over-indulgence', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'why', 'Stone', 'had', 'other', 'actors', 'speaking', 'silly', 'accents', 'when', 'spoke', 'all.Anyway', 'off', 'chest', 'have', 'couple', 'personal', 'angles', 'approach', 'film', 'love', 'unabashed', 'showing', 'Alexander', 'Hephaistion', 'relationship', 'man-and-husband', 'Stone', 'eternal', 'shame', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'courage', 'show', 'properly', 'did', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'Alexander', 'near-rape', 'Persian', 'wife', 'Roxane', 'eternally', 'annoying', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'might', 'commend', 'beautiful', 'display', 'gorgeous', 'Francisco', 'Bosch', 'Alexander', 'male', 'concubine', 'Bagoas', 'yet', 'studios', 'forced', 'Stone', 'cut', 'lovemaking', 'scenes', 'men', 'amounted', 'half', 'hour', 'footage.It', 'was', 'revolting', 'way', 'Stone', 'ultimately', 'reduced', 'Greeks', 'Persians', 'Aryans', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'figures', 'Maybe', 'wanted', 'see', 'way', 'Macedonians', 'saw', 'think', 'was', 'pure', 'laziness', 'odd', 'comparison', 'Stone', 'make', 'Indians', 'monkeys', 'made', 'blood', 'boil', 'just', 'looked', 'fairly', 'obvious.Christopher', 'Plummer', 'cameo', 'Aristotle', 'was', 'delight', 'loved', 'seeing', 'map', 'world', 'taught', 'young', 'Alexander', 'must', 'also', 'make', 'special', 'mention', 'great', 'Elliot', 'Cowan', 'young', 'Ptolemy', 'believable', 'young', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'not', 'easy', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'tried', 'was', 'THE', 'HUMAN', 'STAIN', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', '2003', 'failed.Jared', 'Leto', 'deserves', 'massive', 'kudos', 'know', 'weirdo', 'one', 'like', 'anymore', 'brash', 'beautiful', 'can', 'act', 'little', 'heinie', 'here', 'way', 'Colin', 'eyes', 'love', 'air', 'Not', 'just', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Leto', 'say', 'asexual', 'real', 'life', 'know', 'had', 'fake', 'gal', 'pals', 'daughter', 'boy', 'GAY.Vangelis', 'score', 'bit', 'too', 'lush', 'battle', 'scenes', 'spot-on', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'less', 'less', 'volume', 'operatic', 'film', 'mad', 'scene-chewing', 'made', 'only', 'equally', 'operatic', 'music', 'Ah', 'well', 'film', 'not', 'history', 'class', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'forgiven', 'giving', 'names', 'other', 'actors', 'bit', 'miss', 'here', 'Go', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', ""'re"", 'anxious', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'deserve', 'singling', 'out', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'career', 'brave', 'beautiful', 'Francisco', 'Bosch', 'can', 'be', 'denying', ""'ll"", 'despise', 'second', 'film', ""'ll"", 'adore', 'general', 'way', 'lot', 'better', 'miserable', 'TROY', 'can', 'tell']",Alexander
910199,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0009PLLN6,Enjolras,"[1, 2]","I never did understand how Oliver Stone came to directAlexander, Revisited. Somebody like David McLean (Lawrence of Arabia) or Ridley Scott (Gladiator) seems more appropriate. Stone's vision of Alexander is an attempt at epic, but never quite reaches the grandeur of these other films.First of all, the casting seems all wrong. The Hollywood cast isn't really a great fit for an epic film like [ASIN:B000UPGQIU Alexander]]. Colin Farrell (Alexander) is decent, but not great. At times, he cuts a less than commanding presence. Angelina Jolie overplayed her part as Alexander's mother Olympias. She comes across as psychotic (especially with the fake accent) rather than powerful. Anthony Hopkins' narration becomes intrusive and ruins the drama of parts of the film, rather than enhance it. Some of the best epic films, likeLawrence of Arabia) orGladiatorrelied upon relative unknowns (Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe, respectively), allowing the audience to accept them in the role of historical giants. Farrell and Jolie are too recognizable and don't fill the part.Historically, the movie seems to buy into the whole mythology surrounding Alexander as a generous victor and advocate of liberty. The film starts with a historical inaccuracy -  the notion that Darius' army at Issus had hundreds of thousands of men (in fact, the Persian army was probably around the same size as Alexander's). Also, in the movie Alexander's father is portrayed as a drunken fool, but in real life he was quite a king himself who probably would have conquered the Persian empire in his own right. For a good biography of Alexander that dispels some of the myths, check out Peter Green'sAlexander of Macedon 356-323 B.C.: A Historical Biography. But in a lot of other respects, the film is somewhat accurate and many of the anecdotes (such as Alexander's taming his horse as a child).

With this one, Oliver Stone managed to make that 1950s movie look good and not so boring. The battles are all wrong, even the choice of which to leave out, and only Anthony Hopkins gave me hope at times that it would not be so bad. I was embarassed for my sons and everyone (not many people) at the theater found it dissapointing, to say the least. I do not say don't watch it. Do so; you won't believe me if you do not.

Sadly, I didn't realize that ""Director's Cut"" meant that Stone was going to further cut out history and make Alexander heterosexual to ""appeal to a wider audience.""

910202,AV1YVO2N8YVQE,B0009PLLN6,Ernesto Del Mundo,"[3, 4]","First off, you can't do this story justice as a documentary. It's too big, too complex and too many facts are unknown. But what Oliver Stone used to be good at doing was taking a page from history, embellishing it ""slightly"" and telling it as a lesson for the ages. ""JFK"" might not have been completely faithful to the facts, but it was great cinema with major impact. This is not. This comes across more as a digitally enhanced remake of the 1956 movie with Richard Burton or, at its best, ""Natural Born Killers"" writ large. Questions: what's up with the Anglo actors portraying Greeks? Why couldn't Stone break away from that historically bogus cliche? And the accents...Val Kilmer with a scottish brogue and Angelina Jolie sounding like Natasha from a ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoon. Wrong, just wrong, man. As is the eyeliner (jeeeez) and long straight hair of Alex's main dude Heaphastion. I just can't picture this guy surviving very long on the battlefield. Another big problem is with the total lack of anything remotely resembling Alexander as a mythical near-immortal leader as portrayed by Colin Farrel, who looks more like a cross between George W. Bush and Jim Carrey in a flowing blonde wig. Rosario Dawson as Roxanne doesn't really mean anything to the movie except a nude scene, which at least (very temporarily) alleviates the flagging interest in the storyline. As far as the disjointed flashbacks and the crappy narration by a veeeery tired Anthony Hopkins, we'd be better off without them.

After seeing this film, i'm not surprised of the terrible reviews that Alexander recieved. Yes, it is a very bad film but its not completely useless. There are SOME interesting set pieces and uses of CGI and two fairly exciting battles, but it is the structure, pace and acting that destroys this film. The film starts off when Alexander is young, showing us how he grows up from the words of (non)wisdom from his mother and the strict discipline from his drunken father to his adult days becoming king after his fathers death and finally commanding the Maceadonian army. All of this is shown, but in the wrong way. Flashbacks pop up in different places and the first slow then extremely fast pace just seems to ruin the films essential structure.Although the presentation of the story is bad, its the acting thats worse. Supporting actors have a mix of Irish, British and Scottish accents while Colin Farrell (Alexander) has a very strong Dublin accent and Angelina Jolie (Alexanders mother) strangely aquires a Transylvanian vampire type accent. This does appear silly as they are all supposed to be Greek. A lot of the acting from all parties are exaggerated, as Angelina Jolie over acts and Colin Farrell with his over-the-top dramatization of everything just looks ridiculous on screen.Alexander does have its moments, but not a lot of very good ones. The pace, structure, poor acting and terrible direction of this lenghty film is what brings it down. And somehow this film does not entirely show us how great Alexander was.

That new inspiration came the hard way: from the lashing ""Alexander"" took from legions of critics and from the $150 million film's humiliation at U.S. boxoffices.Director Stone took the opportunity to re-edit key scenes, lengthening here and shortening there. A pair of flashbacks from Alexander the Great's youth now appear later in the film, shaking up the third act and making the epic less linear. But not  necessarily better.A ""beautiful and so tender scene"" between the king and his male lover hits the floor as Stone tones down the bisexual content. ""I can't tell you how many 'real guys' are turned off to this s--t,"" Stone explains.""Alexander II"" loses only eight minutes from the original three-hour running time, though, and the elements that inspired all that hooting and cackling remain: Colin Farrell's goofy blond locks, Alexander's Irish brogue, the odd casting of Angelina Jolie as his mother, Jolie's Natasha-the-cartoon-spy accent, and so on.Those drawn to the DVD by the promise of an improved and intensified film won't have an experience differing all that much from the one in theaters. Expecting little -- and equipped with pause buttons -- many first-time viewers will wonder what the fuss was over this offbeat and mostly entertaining biopic -- probably best approached as an overgrown sword-and-sandal movie, a guilty pleasure.Warner released ""Alexander"" in two double-disc sets: Stone's new cut and the original theatrical. The two versions are not available in one package, unfortunately, and fans springing for both sets will be disappointed to find nearly identical extras. Images are widescreen (about 2.40:1) with brilliant colors and steely sharpness when it is called for. The 5.1 audio deploys the battle scenes with efficiency (sorry, no DTS).Stone works solo on the director's cut commentary. He points out the new changes and offers brief explanations for making them. The goal, basically, was ""to keep it moving."" Much of Stone's talk is repeated on the theatrical DVD's commentary, which edits in observations from historical adviser Robin Lane Fox. Stone does a good job, but the commentary with Fox is stronger and you learn a lot about the real Alexander.Disc 2 features an hour-and-a-half documentary directed in ragged but effective style by Stone's son Sean.

With it's historic storyline, gorgeous sets and costumes, and raw performances ""Alexander"" is a diamond in the rough. The ""diamond"" being the historic epic itself and the ""rough"" being the asinine critics, that have berated the movie from day one.  Colin Farrell's take on ""Alexander"" may have some movie goers wishing for a more dynamic action star, such as Tom Cruise, Hugh Jackman, or maybe even the new James Bond, Daniel Craig?  I, for one, could not have been more pleased than to see Colin Farrell taking on this grandiose role and delivering such a heartfelt performance.  The scenes with Alexander's mother, played wonderfully by exotic beauty Angelina Jolie, were cleverly done by leaving the viewer wondering just what was going on inside this Barbarian Queen's mind.  Val Kilmer surprised me totally in the role of Alexander's father, and did a good job as the savage Macedonian King.With ""Alexander"" the viewer receives: Award winning actor, Anthony Hopkins, giving the narrative, monumental sets and exotic locales, fine cast performances, and a historic tale of Ancient Rome that captivates the viewer with it's twists and turns. So, why does SO MANY film goers bash ""Alexander?""  I believe I discovered the movie's core dislike while discussing it with various people. The issue that came up again and again, was- ""I can't believe a man like Alexander The Great was sexually attracted to other men,"" and  ""The scenes with Alexander kissing and going to bed with other guys should've been cut,"" or ""It would've been MUCH better, had he not been portrayed as some kind of a gay guy.""  So, there I had uncovered ""Alexander's"" thorn.  These ""movie goers"" had went to see, or bought the DVD, for ""Alexander"" the historic adventurer and King who had a wife and a child, not ""Alexander"" the historic adventurer and King, who had a wife and child, but also several male lovers! Leave it to Oliver Stone to ""tell it like it is"" and get in trouble for it! Bravo!!The DVD is excellent with an enjoyable introduction by Oliver Stone, the newly ""revised"" and equally entertaining new ""director's cut"" of the movie, including an `""intermission"" at the end of Disc 1.  I found the movie excelled in it's story telling and all the performers were cast perfectly. Again, love it or hate it, ""Alexander"" will one day prevail as a historic epic masterpiece, as did Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra,"" which in its day was hailed a  ""major disaster,"" but is now a much loved movie (with somewhat of a ""camp"" following) recounting the days of Queens and Pharaohs.  For those who are reading this review, and have not seen ""Alexander,"" I recommend this ""new director's cut,"" and for those who have seen it and still disregard it as ""overblown Hollywood fodder,"" I say, ""to each his own.""  My hat off to Oliver Stone, once again, (loved Stone's ""JFK!"") for bringing the ""true"" story of Alexander to the screen.

910211,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B0009PLLN6,Frederick Baptist,"[0, 0]","I guess it's a blessing I didn't watch any of the prior releases with this the Final Cut being my first viewing of the film but still it is clear to me that Oliver Stone is no Ridley Scott or even David Lean and so this film suffers somewhat from Stone's heavily documentary-like approach to film making.  At times I felt like I was watching a very, very long History Channel documentary and yet I have to say that I didn't find the film to be as bad as many other reviewers here apparently do.  I do agree with those who say that a lot of Alexander's important exploits are not showcased but instead are glossed over through Ptolemy's narratives but in fairness to Stone it would probably take 3 four-hour long movies to portray them all and at least the incredible defeat of Darius using the brilliant technique that is still taught in most military schools is shown here with at least for me irritating subtitles which only makes it feel even more like a History Channel documentary but overall I feel that once you get used to Stone's style of storytelling which is unlike most similar epics that we have seen from other directors like Kubrick, Scott or Lean this film while not perfect is still very good and engaging.  I found myself forced to concentrate and to pay attention throughout to catch the flow given the frequent flashbacks and jumping around and as such I didn't really feel the length of the film having so immersed myself in it.Story aside at least the picture and sound qualities were very good and although the special feature documentaries aren't that entertaining at least we finally get Alexander in the form that Stone was best able to deliver.  In trying to show the human side and to explain what makes him tick, Stone has succeeded in emphasising that aspect albeit having to sacrifice the more exciting fighting scenes.Not for everyone but it's probably the best that Stone could have done.",4,Closer to History Than Most Hollywood Epics And Overall An Enjoyable Film in Bluray!,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,1921,"['guess', 'blessing', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'prior', 'releases', 'Final', 'Cut', 'being', 'first', 'viewing', 'film', 'still', 'clear', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'even', 'David', 'Lean', 'so', 'film', 'suffers', 'somewhat', 'Stone', 'heavily', 'documentary-like', 'approach', 'film', 'making', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'yet', 'have', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'apparently', 'do', 'do', 'agree', 'who', 'say', 'lot', 'Alexander', 'important', 'exploits', 'are', 'not', 'showcased', 'instead', 'are', 'glossed', 'Ptolemy', 'narratives', 'fairness', 'Stone', 'would', 'probably', 'take', '3', 'four-hour', 'long', 'movies', 'portray', 'least', 'incredible', 'defeat', 'Darius', 'using', 'brilliant', 'technique', 'still', 'taught', 'most', 'military', 'schools', 'shown', 'here', 'least', 'irritating', 'subtitles', 'only', 'feel', 'even', 'more', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'overall', 'feel', 'once', 'get', 'used', 'Stone', 'style', 'storytelling', 'most', 'similar', 'epics', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'directors', 'Kubrick', 'Scott', 'Lean', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'engaging', 'found', 'forced', 'concentrate', 'pay', 'attention', 'catch', 'flow', 'given', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'jumping', 'around', 'such', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'length', 'film', 'having', 'so', 'immersed', 'it.Story', 'aside', 'least', 'picture', 'sound', 'qualities', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'special', 'feature', 'documentaries', 'are', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'least', 'finally', 'get', 'Alexander', 'form', 'Stone', 'was', 'best', 'able', 'deliver', 'trying', 'show', 'human', 'side', 'explain', 'what', 'tick', 'Stone', 'succeeded', 'emphasising', 'aspect', 'having', 'sacrifice', 'more', 'exciting', 'fighting', 'scenes.Not', 'everyone', 'probably', 'best', 'Stone', 'could', 'have', 'done']",Alexander
910212,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B0009PLLN6,F. S. L'hoir,"[2, 4]","Three-and-a-half stars, actually.The story of Alexander is so broad in scope it would be impossible to do it justice, but Oliver Stone has made a bold attempt at it. Some scenes work quite well. An example is the Battle of Gaugamela, with which Stone begins the epic (conflating it with the battle of Granicus in which Cleitus actually saved Alexander's life). Although I am not usually an enthusiast of battle scenes in glorious technicolor, I found Stone's depiction of Alexander's third major battle with Darius III quite thrilling. I was very interested in seeing the sarissas--the Macedonian long (and heavy) pikes--in action. I also appreciated Stone's labeling of the left, right, and center wings in an attempt to clarify Alexander's strategy of attacking the enemy at its strongest point rather than its weakest.I found the Battle of the Hydaspes River with Porus less convincing. For one thing, Stone placed the mutiny at the Hypahsis before the battle with Porus and not after (In addition to facing monsoons, rotting clothes, fungus, disease, and  poisonous snakes, the army had to face King Porus and his elephants--the last straw on what by that time was a 17,000 mile march that made the troops demand that Alexander turn back). For another, the actual account of the Macedonian army  on one side of the Hydaspes River (the Jhelum) and the Indian army on the other side paralleling and trying to psych each other out is so much more exciting. Although the rearing and roaring of the elephants (and the resulting bloody mess) was effective, the armies did not fight in the middle of a tree-glutted jungle, but on a sandy spot where there was room to maneuver. Since Stone also conflated the Hydaspes (in which the 31-year old Bucephalus died from injuries) with the Battle with the Mallians, where Alexander was shot in the lung, the surrender of Porus to Alexander (one of the great moments) got dropped. In fact Stone stole Porus' line of wanting to be treated like a king, and reassigned it to Stateira at Babylon, who wanted to be treated like a princess (big deal!).In addition to the Gaugamela scene, the flashbacks worked quite well; in fact, I think the flashbacks to Alexander's childhood and youth, probably worked the best as far as explicating the story, which is actually a bit of a mess after Babylon.And while I can see that it might not be practical, not to mention impossible, to present all the highlights of the saga, the omission of Alexander's burning of Persepolis is simply inexcusable; and Stone also missed a couple of great opportunities, first, by not showing Alexander's armies moving through the burning oil fields between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, and next, by omitting the ""Macedonian flyers"" climbing of the Soghdian rock, which is where Alexander is said to have met and married Roxane (Her introduction to Alexander in the movie, not to mention the animalistic love scene that seems to have been intended to demonstrate Alexander's latent heterosexuality to those who are bothered by Hephaistion and Bagoas, was both tacky and lame).As for the characters, Anthony Hopkins gave the elderly Ptolemy--dictating his memoirs--a touch of class (But did Ptolemy's scribes who are shown following him around with their laptop papyrus desks really have pens that didn't need to be dipped into ink?); and Christopher Plummer made a suitably distinguished Aristotle. However, I could have done without Angelina Jolie's pseudo-Epirot accent; and Colin Farrel's five-o'clock shadow made him look more like Alexander the Wimp. Stone also omitted major characters that would have added immensely to the plot, including Callisthenes, Aristotle's nephew who objected to Alexander's dressing in Persian style and making the Macedonians prostrate themselves on the ground (plot-points that got lost in this production), and Stone also omitted Aristander of Telmessus, Alexander's soothsayer and damage-control czar, who used the omens to explain Alexander's increasingly bizarre behavior as he moved farther away from civilization.I did not see the first versions of this film, so I cannot compare this one with them; and while I found ""Alexander Revisited"" interesting--partly because the actual story is so fascinating--I feel that Oliver Stone missed the sweeping scope that the story would have had at the hands--say--of David Lean. But then David Lean probably would have had the good sense not to attempt an epic of such magnitude.",3,Not as Bad as I Thought It Was Going To Be!,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,4473,"['Three-and-a-half', 'stars', 'actually.The', 'story', 'Alexander', 'so', 'broad', 'scope', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'do', 'justice', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'made', 'bold', 'attempt', 'scenes', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'example', 'Battle', 'Gaugamela', 'Stone', 'epic', 'conflating', 'battle', 'Granicus', 'Cleitus', 'actually', 'saved', 'Alexander', 'life', 'am', 'not', 'usually', 'enthusiast', 'battle', 'scenes', 'glorious', 'technicolor', 'found', 'Stone', 'depiction', 'Alexander', 'third', 'major', 'battle', 'Darius', 'III', 'quite', 'thrilling', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'seeing', 'sarissas', 'Macedonian', 'long', 'heavy', 'pikes', 'action', 'also', 'appreciated', 'Stone', 'labeling', 'left', 'right', 'center', 'wings', 'attempt', 'clarify', 'Alexander', 'strategy', 'attacking', 'enemy', 'strongest', 'point', 'rather', 'weakest.I', 'found', 'Battle', 'Hydaspes', 'River', 'Porus', 'convincing', 'one', 'thing', 'Stone', 'placed', 'mutiny', 'Hypahsis', 'battle', 'Porus', 'not', 'addition', 'facing', 'monsoons', 'rotting', 'clothes', 'fungus', 'disease', 'poisonous', 'snakes', 'army', 'had', 'face', 'King', 'Porus', 'elephants', 'last', 'straw', 'what', 'time', 'was', '17,000', 'mile', 'march', 'made', 'troops', 'demand', 'Alexander', 'turn', 'back', 'actual', 'account', 'Macedonian', 'army', 'one', 'side', 'Hydaspes', 'River', 'Jhelum', 'Indian', 'army', 'other', 'side', 'paralleling', 'trying', 'psych', 'other', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'rearing', 'roaring', 'elephants', 'resulting', 'bloody', 'mess', 'was', 'effective', 'armies', 'did', 'not', 'fight', 'middle', 'tree-glutted', 'jungle', 'sandy', 'spot', 'where', 'was', 'room', 'maneuver', 'Stone', 'also', 'conflated', 'Hydaspes', '31-year', 'old', 'Bucephalus', 'died', 'injuries', 'Battle', 'Mallians', 'where', 'Alexander', 'was', 'shot', 'lung', 'surrender', 'Porus', 'Alexander', 'one', 'great', 'moments', 'got', 'dropped', 'fact', 'Stone', 'stole', 'Porus', 'line', 'wanting', 'be', 'treated', 'king', 'reassigned', 'Stateira', 'Babylon', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'treated', 'princess', 'big', 'deal', 'addition', 'Gaugamela', 'scene', 'flashbacks', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'fact', 'think', 'flashbacks', 'Alexander', 'childhood', 'youth', 'probably', 'worked', 'best', 'as', 'far', 'explicating', 'story', 'actually', 'bit', 'mess', 'Babylon.And', 'can', 'see', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'practical', 'not', 'mention', 'impossible', 'present', 'highlights', 'saga', 'omission', 'Alexander', 'burning', 'Persepolis', 'simply', 'inexcusable', 'Stone', 'also', 'missed', 'couple', 'great', 'opportunities', 'first', 'not', 'showing', 'Alexander', 'armies', 'moving', 'burning', 'oil', 'fields', 'Tigris', 'Euphrates', 'Rivers', 'next', 'omitting', 'Macedonian', 'flyers', 'climbing', 'Soghdian', 'rock', 'where', 'Alexander', 'said', 'have', 'met', 'married', 'Roxane', 'introduction', 'Alexander', 'movie', 'not', 'mention', 'animalistic', 'love', 'scene', 'have', 'been', 'intended', 'demonstrate', 'Alexander', 'latent', 'heterosexuality', 'who', 'are', 'bothered', 'Hephaistion', 'Bagoas', 'was', 'tacky', 'lame', '.As', 'characters', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'gave', 'elderly', 'Ptolemy', 'dictating', 'memoirs', 'touch', 'class', 'did', 'Ptolemy', 'scribes', 'who', 'are', 'shown', 'following', 'laptop', 'papyrus', 'desks', 'really', 'have', 'pens', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'dipped', 'ink', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'made', 'suitably', 'distinguished', 'Aristotle', 'However', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'pseudo-Epirot', 'accent', 'Colin', 'Farrel', ""five-o'clock"", 'shadow', 'made', 'look', 'more', 'Alexander', 'Wimp', 'Stone', 'also', 'omitted', 'major', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'immensely', 'plot', 'including', 'Callisthenes', 'Aristotle', 'nephew', 'who', 'objected', 'Alexander', 'dressing', 'Persian', 'style', 'making', 'Macedonians', 'prostrate', 'ground', 'plot-points', 'got', 'lost', 'production', 'Stone', 'also', 'omitted', 'Aristander', 'Telmessus', 'Alexander', 'soothsayer', 'damage-control', 'czar', 'who', 'used', 'omens', 'explain', 'Alexander', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'moved', 'farther', 'away', 'civilization.I', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'first', 'versions', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'one', 'found', 'Alexander', 'Revisited', 'interesting', 'partly', 'actual', 'story', 'so', 'fascinating', 'feel', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'missed', 'sweeping', 'scope', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'hands', 'say', 'David', 'Lean', 'then', 'David', 'Lean', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'not', 'attempt', 'epic', 'such', 'magnitude']",Alexander

This film will concentrate on those eight years of battles, as well as his relationship with his boyhood friend and battle mate, Hephaestion. Alexander died young, of illness, at 33.""The good: Young Alexander calms and rides wild black stallion Bucephalus; Val Kilmer as Alexander's warrior father Phillip shows the boy cave drawings of Greek myths which presage Alexander's life... Two battles - the first at Gaugamela where young Alexander defeated King Darius and the second - magnificent and spectacular battle of Alexander's army against elephants in India with the unforgettable shot of Alexander on his horse against the huge animal; the surreal atmosphere of the last battle thanks to the color red that dominated the scene as seen through the eyes of the wounded Alexander. Legendary Babylon with its Tower and the hanging Gardens is breathtaking as it is shown in the movie. Angelina Jolie was regal....when her mouth was shut and here I come to the bad and the ridiculous. Who on earth decided that the Queen of the Ancient Macedonia in the 4th Century B.C.) should speak with the most horrible imitation of an Eastern European accent ever on the screen? The scenes between Jolie and Farrell made me laugh - so bizarre and ludicrous they were. Besides, even if I assume that Olimpias had Alexander when she was very young, 15 or 16, she did not change a bit when he was 25, and they looked together like a brother and a sister or two lovers - not like a mother and son. The real problem is that with all the and passion for his project and its subject, Stone could not make his overlong (almost three hours) movie as interesting and convincing as just some of its parts are. I have nothing against non-linear structure - when it works but here it was distracting and confusing - the only way to realize where and when you were was by watching the length of Alexander's hair.

I like Stone's movies as whole, but this one is a wee bit of a mess. After almost three hours, you still don't know what makes Alexander tick (except maybe that his mother poisoned his mind). Admittedly, the film bravely addresses Alexander's bi-sexuality (not a wise commercial move when you consider the target market for an action epic is teenage males), but this doesn't serve to add any dimension to Alexander's character. The film's episodic nature doesn't make for cohesive viewing, and the use of flash forwards and flash backs simply makes it worse - one minute Alexander is a boy of ten, the next minute he's rallying his troops for his  famous victory at Gaugamela. There's no sense of drama, which is a shame because there's some great opportunities for drama here - his relationship with his father, the conflict with his squabbling commanders, and his own obssession with conquering the world. Despiite the almost three hour running time, you always feel like you're missing important scenes. Nothing is dealt with in-depth. The two battles simply happen - there's no buildup and as far as the final battle is concerned, you're not even sure where the heck it happened. The battles themselves are a confusing mess, despite supers during Gaugamela telling you where you are in the fight. The CGI effects are terribly obvious - the entry into Babylon is like viewing a computer game. At times, you actually feel like you're watching a TV movie, with lots of overacting extras, bad special effects and a terrible soundtrack.I don't know. Maybe the story of Alexander is impossible to film; Robert Rossen's 1955 go at it was no great shakes either. Even Steven Pressfield's novel (which is strikingly similar to this film) didn't shed much light on what drove Alexander to conquer the world.

910217,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0009PLLN6,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[30, 43]","Viewers who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in Oliver Stone's ALEXANDER, which includes exactly two fairly brief battle sequences in its three hour running time.  The film is not about conquest; it is an attempt to create a character study of one of history's most self-contradictory and enigmatic figures.The emphasis, however, should be on the word ""attempt.""  ALEXANDER fails in three basic ways: in its cast, in its refusal to meet certain character issues head-on, and in a directorial decision that easily ranks among the most serious misfires in recent memory.Alexander the Great was a charismatic, self-contradictory, and enigmatic leader who led and inspired the largest army the world had seen up to that point.  He was a battle-tested killing machine by age sixteen, King of Macedonia by twenty, conqueror of the known world by thirty-and above all one of the great military geniuses of his or any other age.  Colin Farrell plays the character as a weak-minded, emotionally distraught entity, going through the entire film with a series of facial expressions that would lead you to believe he is in desperate need of a dose of salts.  It is completely impossible to accept him in the role.Although Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie give acceptable if not particularly memorable performances as King Philip and Queen Olympias, the remaining performances are equally impossible.  Jared Leto's Hephaistion looks for all the world like a Malibu hooker afflicted by an eyeliner addiction; it is impossible to perceive him as Alexander's military whip.  Franciso Bosch's Bagoas could be an ancient-world version of Cher after a particularly thick night, albeit with better cleavage.  As for Queen Roxane, history notes that she was an unattractive minor tribal princess that Alexander found annoying but whom he married in order to secure military aid from her father.  The role, however, is considerably revised, and while Rosario Dawson gives it all she has the part plays like something out of bondage skin flick.During the film's theatrical release some audiences complained that Alexander was portrayed as a homosexual.  Unfortunately for those who come unhinged over such matters, you cannot offer a psychological portrait of Alexander without indicating his general indifference to women and putting him in bed with at least two men: the general Hepaistion and the eunuch and sex slave Bagoas.  That is who Alexander was; that was what the ancient world was like.  But instead of meeting this issue head-on, the film attempts to ""indicate"" the relationships through a series of longing gazes, the occasional caress, and some of the most embarrassingly bad dialogue ever written for the screen.  The resulting relationships read like something off a television soap opera that has been canceled halfway into the first season.For the sexually insecure, there is a DVD issue that deletes some eight minutes of this footage; although I went with the unedited version, and although the scenes in question are very badly done, I cannot imagine the deletion of these largely cringe-inducing scenes improves the film to any significant degree-largely because virtually everything about the film is no less awkward.The script is at best mediocre and the story line so incoherent that Anthony Hopkins is required to provide constant narration-something that has the effect of telling us what happened rather than allowing us to see it happen.  But by far the greatest failing of the script and story line is Oliver Stone's decision to present a chunk of the story, such as it is, out of sequence.In essence, the first half hour of the film establishes the tri-fold conflict between King Philip, Queen Olympias, and the young Alexander and runs up to a major confrontation.  At this point the film suddenly jumps eight years ahead to the invasion of Persia, and the jump does not read as intentional but as an outrageous, unexpected, and disastrous flaw in the film.  Approximately two hours later the film presents this ""lost time"" in the form of a flashback-but by this point the purpose of the scenes have been lost and we've all figured out the details anyway.  Oliver Stone is a master of creating parallel storylines and time lines.  One need look no further than JFK to see his skill.  It is astonishing, utterly astonishing, that he could do no better than this and, not being able to do better, did not find a better way entirely.When all is said and done, Alexander is presented as an out-of-control weakling, his psychological motivations are hilariously pat at best, and it is utterly impossible to imagine that this person could command such a large force, much less lead it to a single victory, much less conquer the known world.  Clearly Stone was attempting to reach a new height in epic cinema, but the Greeks had a word for ill-advised ambition founded on a god-like arrogance: hubris.  It was a sin they believed was never left unpunished, and in this instance the punishment is a career-crippling, if not entirely career-killing, film.As noted, there are several DVD versions, including a director's cut that removes approximately fifteen minutes, eight of them dealing with Alexander's sexuality.  Bonuses include documentaries on the making of the film and on composer Vangelis, who scored it, as well as an amazingly beside-the-point commentary by director Stone and historian Robin Lane Fox.GFT,

The greatest problem with  Oliver Stone's movie Alexander is that he failed to motivate Alexander in a way that explains his greatness.In the movie, Alexander is repulsed by his mother who killed his father, Philip of Macedon.  This causes him to become homosexual and to leave Greece on a conquoring rampage.All Alexander had to do to fulfill his destiny, by this definition, is to leave his mother's side.  That does not explain what motivated him to lead the largest army in the ancient world half way to China.  It does not explain how he motived his men to fight for him for so long.  It does not touch on his genius for conquoring people in foreign lands.In short, it does not explain anything that made him great.The other flaw in Alexander is that the movie has too many flashbacks.  They see-saw back and forth confusingly, and the narrator does not clearly explain what each segment adds to the main story.This minor technical irritation could be overcome if the basic psychological motivation for Alexander's greatness was correctly presented.

I have no problem with him being portrayed as flawed, and at times, desperate.But I do expect Alexander to be portrayed as noble. And nobility is the key quality that Colin Farrell fails to bring to this role. Towards the end of the story, he seems so overwhelmed by suspicions and insecurities, that he behaves like an alcoholic, desperate for his next drink. Unusually, there are a number of Irish accents in this movie.The film has some good points: the two major battles are done well. The first is particularly educational for those interested in battlefield tactics, with the occasional appearance of on-screen captions such as 'Macedonian Left'. The second is hard for animal lovers to watch, but of course horses did get speared and battle-elephants did get their trunks sliced off. (This sets a high standard for Vinn Diesel's future production of Ross Leckie's 'Hannibal'.)Only three other comments: firstly, I found the going-back and coming-forward in time irritating. Secondly, I worry about a movie in which, according to the credits, Alexander's mum is the second-most important character in the story.  Thirdly, Vangelis' score is lacklustre.  Vangelis has produced some amazing scores -- e.g. 'Bounty' and 'Chariots of Fire' -- but while other composers of the same generation continue to produce brilliant work (e.g. Hans Zimmer on 'The Last Samurai') Mr Papathanassiou seems utterly stuck.A big disappointment.",2,Blondie goes to Bactria.

He's never been able to catch lightning in a bottle again, since.""Alexander"" is the story of Alexander the Great (Colin Farrell) and his conquests and his relationship with his mother Olympia (Angelina Jolie) and his father Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer).The film is ostensibly being told in flashbacks via the great scholar Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) to his students. It is an unnecessary gimmick. Hopkins does fine and the added time is arguably some of the best information that we receive in the film - BUT if the script had been better written, these scenes would not have been necessary.Farrell is in way over his head as the lead in this film. He can't carry the film. He neither has the talent nor the emotional range for such an historic figure. Why does Farrell use his native Irish accent (and why does the young actor who plays him as a youth do the same?)? More on this later...Jolie as Alexander's mother uses as bizarre Russian-esque accent that is terribly out of place with who Olympia actually was.Stone seems to be confused as to what direction to take the film. He gives us enormous battles of grand scale, but he doesn't take the time to let us learn about the combatants (you get face shots, but from a distance you can't tell who's who). He attempts to give us detail about Alexander's thought process regarding current and future battles/conquests, but the dialog itself is so juvenile in content that it's more like a couple of kids arguing over who's going to play cowboy and who's going to play Indian.We move through all of Alexander's important battles ad infinatum!! It is completely unnecessary for us to go through each and every battle in the way that Stone has us do. It is redundant and quite frankly very boring after a time. How many times can we hear that Alexander's troops are unhappy and disagree with his campaign and that they want to go home? Well, we hear it over and over. And we also get repeats of almost the same speech from Alexander...Alexander doesn't take spoils of war in Babylon, India or any other areas of Asia. This we are told over and over. But we are never privy to the ""why"". There's more action than dialogue and even though this was intended to be a BIG TENT POLE film (aka: action film), the very subject matter warrants a closer, more intelligent look than this film provides.Alexander was the not only Alexander the Great, but he is - to this very day - the greatest (and some would say most benevolent) conqueror to ever walk the Earth. Surely, such trite treatment is insulting to his greatness.I'll give a few kudos to Stone for his major inclusion of Alexander's bisexuality (it wasn't a big thing back then), but what the heck is up with that androgenous male dancer with whom he takes up late in the film? Did he cast away Hephestaion (his lover since childhood)? Is he cheating on him? It is seemly there for shock value. It makes no sense plotwise. Since Jared Leto is cast as Hephastaion, it would seem that the best material regarding Alexander and his male lover are on the cutting room floor - Leto's role is so small that it is almost cameo material.Rosario Dawson as Alexander's wife is very miscast. She looks about as Persian as an Eskimo. That aside, we're never really sure if she is disgusted with Alexander's relationship with Hephastaion or if it is Alexander with whom she is initially disgusted - a better set of actors might have been able to answer this question.Now, the accents....Jolie's Russian is totally bizarre, but let's move on. We know that it is traditional for American films to have foreign characters denoted by using English accents. If the foreign characters are villains then they typically (and insultingly) use German accents. If this is the case, then why in the world is Farrell using his native Irish for Alexander? Why not English? No one else uses the Irish accent. Here we have the accents of an immediate family: Philip (kilmer), Alexander's father: English accent; Olympia (Jolie), Alexander's mother: Russian accent; Alexander  (Farrell), Irish accent. Bizarre doesn't even begin to describe it. The poor kid who played Alexander as a young boy must have been nonplussed trying to figure out why he was delivering his dialog in an Irish accent.The film is sadly not worth the three hours it takes to watch it. I would really enjoy seeing a film on Alexander using a tight script, good actors, and some tight direction. ""Alexander"" has none of these.",2,Whew!

There seemed to be a lot of fuss about Alexander's homosexual inclinations&#8230;as if this is really controversial in a culture that founded pedophilia. Alexander, it seemed, had sex with almost anything that moved. Frankly, I was much more upset about the horse dying. That was an awesome horse.

910224,AO9764AKXA3JI,B0009PLLN6,"Go for Baroque ""Go for Baroque""","[10, 13]","In my reviewing this third version of ""Alexander,"" it is difficult for me not to contrast the results of Stone's efforts with what might have been had HBO carried through with their proposal to create a ten-part series about Alexander based upon Mary Renault's trilogy ""Fire From Heaven,"" ""The Persian Boy,"" and ""Funeral Games,"" assuming that the producers would have chosen excellent script writers, directors, and actors.  Such a docudrama, run chronologically, would have had a far better chance of covering the almost 33 years of Alexander's life in a more complete and presentable manner.  Stone obviously struggeled in his attempt to produce a hybred docudrama / entertainment film that could fit into a single sitting at a movie theater. In all three versions of his film, he met with varying degrees of success or failure.Still, Stone's production is better (the good parts are far better than many people were capable of recognizing) than many critics and too many audience members thought.  There are reasons for this.Over the years, I have conducted extensive research on Alexander.  Also, my having worked as a mental-health therapist for nearly 30 years, I once engaged it what might be called a ""forensic psychological analysis"" of Alexander and came to some interesting conclusions.  So I have been able to compare and contrast the film with the film industry's ""preferred approach"" to script writing, directing, and production as described to me by my friend who is a university instructor in film.The second version ""Director's Cut"" was an improvement over the initial theater version.  This final version has some further improvements yet suffers from the same, inevitable difficulties of the first two.In an effort to integrate the divers elements of the film into an organic whole, Stone made the choice to move frequently forward or backward in time.  A multi-part docudrama, run chronologically, would have been far easier for most of the public to follow.  Some critics complained about the addition of narration throughout the film, a possibly cumbersome element for an entertainment film.  The additional information was a necessary addition, however, considering the limited length of the film and also the limited historical knowledge of most movie goers.The docudrama elements of Stone's film are historically accurate.  Yet in his attempt to make an entertainment film, Stone engaged in compression of, and skewing of, events, especially in the later battle parts of the film.  Those in the audience who prefer dramatic action to fact may have been more pleased; however, those members who were capable of appreciating the historically accurate parts of the film may have been a little uncomfortable with this conflict between the two approaches.In ""Alexander - Revisited,"" Stone finally was free to include additional dialogue and scene extensions that never should have been omitted in the first two versions, undoubtedly against Stone's wishes.  The pressure on Stone to omit these segments apparently was worry about the film being ""too talky"" and also, frankly, from ignorance and prejudice.  A therapist must attempt to promote acceptance of fact and reality over beliefs that not only defy fact and reality but also have the potential to be harmful.  One of my patients was very upset and angry (along with many viewers and even some Greeks, who should know better) that Stone ""forced upon the viewing public a false, made-up version of Alexander's sexual orientation.""  Stone's portrayal of Alexander and Hepheastion's life-long relationship is accurate, and their expressions of love for each other are done with taste and sensitivity.  I have not read from those persons who were offended by the gentle kiss between Bagoas and Alexander in this third version any comments about the overtly sexual scene with Alexander and Roxanne in all three versions.  Stone, therefore, should be commended for including the scenes with Alexander and Hepheastion and also the additional footage of Bagoas.I own and have watched all three DVD versions of Stone's film.  The second defintely is better than the first.  Although I need to view the second and third versions more in order to come to a more detailed comparison, the additional film footage in ""Alexander - Revisited"" may tip the evaluation scales in its favor, despite the somewhat disjointed feeling resulting from its editing.",4,Better But Not Perfect,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,4414,"['reviewing', 'third', 'version', 'Alexander', 'difficult', 'not', 'contrast', 'results', 'Stone', 'efforts', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'HBO', 'carried', 'proposal', 'create', 'ten-part', 'series', 'Alexander', 'based', 'Mary', 'Renault', 'trilogy', 'Fire', 'From', 'Heaven', 'Persian', 'Boy', 'Funeral', 'Games', 'assuming', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'excellent', 'script', 'writers', 'directors', 'actors', 'docudrama', 'run', 'chronologically', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'far', 'better', 'chance', 'covering', 'almost', '33', 'years', 'Alexander', 'life', 'more', 'complete', 'presentable', 'manner', 'Stone', 'obviously', 'struggeled', 'attempt', 'produce', 'hybred', 'docudrama', '/', 'entertainment', 'film', 'could', 'fit', 'single', 'sitting', 'movie', 'theater', 'three', 'versions', 'film', 'met', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'failure.Still', 'Stone', 'production', 'better', 'good', 'parts', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'capable', 'recognizing', 'many', 'critics', 'too', 'many', 'audience', 'members', 'thought', 'are', 'reasons', 'years', 'have', 'conducted', 'extensive', 'research', 'Alexander', 'Also', 'having', 'worked', 'mental-health', 'therapist', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'once', 'engaged', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'forensic', 'psychological', 'analysis', 'Alexander', 'came', 'interesting', 'conclusions', 'So', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'compare', 'contrast', 'film', 'film', 'industry', 'preferred', 'approach', 'script', 'writing', 'directing', 'production', 'as', 'described', 'friend', 'who', 'university', 'instructor', 'film.The', 'second', 'version', 'Director', 'Cut', 'was', 'improvement', 'initial', 'theater', 'version', 'final', 'version', 'further', 'improvements', 'yet', 'suffers', 'same', 'inevitable', 'difficulties', 'first', 'two.In', 'effort', 'integrate', 'divers', 'elements', 'film', 'organic', 'whole', 'Stone', 'made', 'choice', 'move', 'frequently', 'forward', 'backward', 'time', 'multi-part', 'docudrama', 'run', 'chronologically', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'easier', 'most', 'public', 'follow', 'critics', 'complained', 'addition', 'narration', 'film', 'possibly', 'cumbersome', 'element', 'entertainment', 'film', 'additional', 'information', 'was', 'necessary', 'addition', 'however', 'considering', 'limited', 'length', 'film', 'also', 'limited', 'historical', 'knowledge', 'most', 'movie', 'goers.The', 'docudrama', 'elements', 'Stone', 'film', 'are', 'historically', 'accurate', 'attempt', 'make', 'entertainment', 'film', 'Stone', 'engaged', 'compression', 'skewing', 'events', 'especially', 'later', 'battle', 'parts', 'film', 'audience', 'who', 'prefer', 'dramatic', 'action', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'pleased', 'however', 'members', 'who', 'were', 'capable', 'appreciating', 'historically', 'accurate', 'parts', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'conflict', 'two', 'approaches.In', 'Alexander', 'Revisited', 'Stone', 'finally', 'was', 'free', 'include', 'additional', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'extensions', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'first', 'two', 'versions', 'undoubtedly', 'Stone', 'wishes', 'pressure', 'Stone', 'omit', 'segments', 'apparently', 'was', 'worry', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'talky', 'also', 'frankly', 'ignorance', 'prejudice', 'therapist', 'must', 'attempt', 'promote', 'acceptance', 'fact', 'reality', 'beliefs', 'not', 'only', 'defy', 'fact', 'reality', 'also', 'have', 'potential', 'be', 'harmful', 'One', 'patients', 'was', 'very', 'upset', 'angry', 'many', 'viewers', 'even', 'Greeks', 'who', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'Stone', 'forced', 'viewing', 'public', 'false', 'made-up', 'version', 'Alexander', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'Stone', 'portrayal', 'Alexander', 'Hepheastion', 'life-long', 'relationship', 'accurate', 'expressions', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'done', 'taste', 'sensitivity', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'persons', 'who', 'were', 'offended', 'gentle', 'kiss', 'Bagoas', 'Alexander', 'third', 'version', 'comments', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'scene', 'Alexander', 'Roxanne', 'three', 'versions', 'Stone', 'therefore', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'including', 'scenes', 'Alexander', 'Hepheastion', 'also', 'additional', 'footage', 'Bagoas.I', 'own', 'have', 'watched', 'three', 'DVD', 'versions', 'Stone', 'film', 'second', 'defintely', 'better', 'first', 'need', 'view', 'second', 'third', 'versions', 'more', 'order', 'come', 'more', 'detailed', 'comparison', 'additional', 'film', 'footage', 'Alexander', 'Revisited', 'may', 'tip', 'evaluation', 'favor', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'feeling', 'resulting', 'editing']",Alexander

Thing is, the film is not all that bad at all.  I can remember when this film was being made the complaints coming from Greece because Alexander was shown as bisexual (I can only assume those Greeks who were complaining must be living in denial about their history) Its kind of sad that this aspect was 'toned down' to make it more 'acceptable' What was equally odd were the complaints from Iran because the film showed flied buzzing around the heads of Persian soldiers, some of them wearing Turbans (yeah OK that is annoying considering it isn't an Iranian head dress and this is supposed to be a historical epic) but most daft of all where the complaints that the film showed Iran (or Persia) in a bad light.Come on now, first of all this is a film.  Now are you seriously trying to tell me that there are not films made in Iran showing victories of historical Persian armies over their enemies?

First off everyone will have a complaint about this film as it is impossible to chronicle Alexanders entire life in a few hours of cinema what the director here has done is attempt to capture some of the most important aspects of it and in this I think he has done a fairly good job.The greatness of the Persian empire and its capital, the warlike Greeks, the strange cultures that Alexanders men met on their journey east, the battle scenes are well directed (especially those in India) the whole hedonistic culture of the ancient world also is well captured.  Perhaps there could have been a better choice of actors for some of the roles (Alexander for example) and not entirely sure about Angelina Jolie in this role (not too sure about her in any role for that matter, wasn't too bad in Gia though)Still, think the critics were a little too harsh.

Alas, Green's book is far more interesting than Oliver Stone's long and tedious ""Alexander"".  Colin Farrell is badly miscast as the Macedonian conqueror; he spends the entire film crying, whining and generally overacting to the point that this viewer actually dreaded his next scene.In point of fact, just about everyone is miscast in ""Alexander"", particularly Angelina Jolie, who is obviously too young to be the central character's mother.  The one saving grace is Val Kilmer as Alexander's father, Philip.  Kilmer gives life to Philip's drunken antics; it is known that the Macedonians were very fond of drinking to excess-Alexander himself killed one of his top commanders, Cleitus, in another alcohol-fueled confrontation (shown all too graphically in the film).Much of the chronology in the film is accurate (though Stone's flashbacks will confuse those with limited knowledge of Alexander's life).  Two major battles of Alexander's Asian campaign are portrayed:  Gaugamela (thought to be near Mosul in modern day Iraq), and The Hydaspes in what is now Pakistan.  Unfortunately neither the place nor the opposing commander (the Indian King Porus) in the latter battle are even mentioned in the film.  I felt the Granicus River, the place where Alexander first met the Persian King Darius III in battle after crossing into Asia, would have made a better subject than the gigantic Gaugamela.  Alexander was badly wounded there, but recovered.  Granicus was a nearly evenly matched affair, which could have gone either way.More than 2,300 years after his death, Alexander's exploits have become legend. Many episodes in Alexander's life are well known in our day: the first encounter with his famed horse Bucephalus (perhaps the first equine in recorded history to be known by name), to the aforementioned murder of Cleitus, to his deathbed, where he refused to name a successor among his commanders.  Somehow the film deflates these occurrences; by trying to make Alexander almost godlike, Stone undercuts the import of them.Even though the timeline is largely right, the film simply does not have ""life""; it is told in an almost comatose fashion.  Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" had similar elements, yet was never boring-even the calmer periods of the film were well-acted and held the viewer's interest.  ""Alexander"" plods along to the next battle, personal confrontation or intrigue without much fanfare.Alexander the Great is acknowledged by just about anyone with a brain as the greatest military commander of all time-he never lost a battle in his short 32 years of life-but this film falls far short of doing his legacy justice.  The biggest flaw in the film is casting Colin Farrell in a role that is clearly beyond his abilities.

910228,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009PLLN6,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","Few films have garnered the criticism as the theatrical release of the much maligned ALEXANDER and that fact always stirs the curiosity cauldron - in this case, so much so that Oliver Stone decided to re-edit and re-compose the original version into this Director's Cut DVD.  Now the film can be viewed in the relatively inexpensive milieu of the home and perhaps more folks will give another  (or, as in my case, a first) look at what the grumbling is all about.ALEXANDER is a big film about a big person who did big things.  How a story so altered by time, history, myth, and folklore could be translated to the screen strains the imagination - but not Oliver Stone's - a man who loves big events and big issues.  And I think he succeeds in drawing us into the atmosphere of the 'civilized world' of Alexander's time.  Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) relates the history of a man who wished to tie the known world together into one empire and would have us believe that dream was altruistic as well as destined.  Through a series of flash forwards and flashbacks the birth to death of Alexander is pieced together: each time a great moment or crisis occurs in Alexander's life, the story backtracks to explain the etiological influences of that particular step in Alexander's march around the globe.The settings of Alexander's youth in Macedonia are breathtakingly beautiful in the cave painting details of the various gods and heroes and heroines that so deeply influenced the life of Alexander - Medea, Oedipus, Herakles, Zeus, etc.  If the entire film had been able to maintain this mystic quality of ambience, this would have been a powerful work.  But once the scenes begin to disperse to Persia, India, Greece, etc the film becomes Hollywoodized and harkens back to the Cecil B. DeMille view of ancient history, garnished with expensive sets and costumes and endless dancing maidens and overwrought battle sequences.Where this film (at least this version) is best is when it approaches the passion of Alexander for Hephaistion. Few writers or film makers have dared to enter the arena of homosexual love of heroes of history and this is where Stone takes the chance - and then unfortunately heavily edits the romance from this 'director's cut'.  A missed opportunity to examine an important aspect of neglected history is sad.As for the cast, Colin Farrell does his best with the script he has in making us believe in Alexander, and he is able to connect the chemistry with Jared Leto's Hephaistion well. Angelina Jolie is aptly smarmy as the snake-loving Olympias, Val Kilmer's Philip, grotesquely hidden behind scars of makeup, is suitably evil, but given the tritely written roles of Aristotle (Christopher Plummer) and Roxane (Rosario Dawson) the rest of the cast is forgettable.But now that the film is available in two forms for less money than a pair of theater tickets perhaps more people will watch, plug in to Oliver Stone's concept, and the air will clear.  I, for one, think it is a film worth watching!

Therefore, I believe I am judging this film fairly.""Alexander"" is a stab at a great movie, but falls short. It is no easy thing to create a movie about Alexander's life. Even though he died young, his life was packed with more events than most men that live to be old. This presents a problem of the length of the film, which was too long. It could not have been much shorter, but I think things should have been added that were missing, and other things that were unnecessary taken out.There are too many long seens of slow dialogue, most of which is useless. The exchanges between Alexander and Hephaistion were not done well, in my opinion, and the viewer didn't really feel that they were great companions.The acting in this film was well done. Despite what other may say, Angelina Jolie played a great Olympias, not overdoing the sense of poisonous pride and need for vengeance against Phillip through Alexander's glory. This aspect of the film, the relationship between Alexander and Olympias, was a memorable one. However, most of the key players in Alexander's life- (Hephaistion, Parmenion, Bagoas, etc.) were either miscasted or simply poorely presented.Two other great performances were Val Kilmer as the deranged and troubled Phillip, and Rosario Dawson as Roxanne.The role of Alexander himself was surely a difficult one to fill, and when considering the relative dauntingness of this part, Colin Farrell played the part very well.Anthony Hopkins was a wonderful Ptolemy, but was not given good enough lines to perform. He seemed to go on about so many different things that the viewer lost attention. He wasn't given much room to prove himself in this movie.First, I will outline the aspects of the film that direly needed improvement. The slow motion battle sequences were downright absurd at times, particularly the sequence against the war elephants in India in which Bucephelus is killed and Alexander wounded. The cinematography was not as artsy as it should have been, as befitting such an epic. Darius and the Persians were poorly depicted as cowards and evil dictators.This movie began wonderfully, then wasted away, much as Alexander's career did. The beginning was wonderful, with Alexander as an inquisitve and troubled child. Scenes such as the fight between Olympias and Phillip in the bedroom with Alexander hidden under the sheets, and the taming of Bucephelus were excellent. However, once he leaves Pella, the movie skips many key points in his life and moves right to Guagemala, his key victory over the Persian Empire. Several wonderful events are overlooked and brushed aside: Alexander's visit to the ruins of Troy, The Battle of Issus, the Siege of Tyre, Alexander's travels in Egypt, including to the Oracle of Ammon at Siwa, and crowning as Pharaoh in Memphis.The battle of Guagemela is mediocre. The movie's special effects were not wonderful, and the battle sequences needed editing and innovate ways to make the battles more interesting.The best parts of this movie, in my opinion, are the beautiful sets and visual recreations, especially of the city of Babylon. The sets of Pella were lavish and darkly beautiful. The reconstructions of Alexandria where Old Ptolemy sits and dictates his history of Alexander's life were breathtaking, as was Ptolemy's palace, and the extravagant and mighty streets and collonades of old Babylon. However, as soon as Alexander leaves Babylon, the movie begins to disintegrate.Quickly, this film, like Alexander's life, turns into one nightmarish event after another; conspiracies, famines, mutiny, exhaustion, personal loss, disease, low morale, and ruthless and savage enemies. The movie turns into a long and drawn out nightmare as Alexander gets farther and farther away from the known world.The battles in India and such were poorly done. The coverage of the revolts against Alexander, conspiracies against him, and the long and miserable journey back West were likewise unenjoyable to watch. The movie unravelled at the seams as soon as they passed beyond their sphere of knowledge, past Persia or anything they knew.Overall, this movie is not very well done. A great score accompanies the film, but the music, written by Vangelis, was not used to the fullest, and can scarcely be heard.Actually, this movie was relatively historically accruate throughout, with the exception of a few minor things. (Just to point out an example, in the scenes of Alexandria, the Pharos Lighthouse is shown fully operational and standing tall over the harbor, when in fact it wasn't completed or used until after Ptolemy's death.) It's the little things that knaw at the plot. But, all things considered, it wasn't a classical mythology reworked and contorted to appeal to the general public, which is good. They didn't try to make Alexander your typical Hollywood, heterosexual hero, and showed him as a flawed and troubled man.But one must considered what a feat it would have been to make a perfect film about Alexander's entire life. It seems impossible. To fit everything in, they would have had to have made a nine hour film. Personally, I think the story would have been served much better should they have made it into several, two or even three, seperate movies, like a trilogy. This way, all of the great events of his life could have been shown and treated with importance. Overall, this movie tried and failed. Watch the first hour or so, then turn it off and imagine that the rest of the movie was treated with the same brilliance and care.Historical buffs of the beginning of Hellenism and the era of Alexander the Great should give it a view on a rainy day just to see a different interpretation of his life. But don't take it too seriously. For those who don't already know the history behind it, this movie will be extremely confusing and boring to you.

910232,A34ZAYTNP67S83,B0009PLLN6,Greekfreak,"[20, 21]","Before I begin, I should first state that most of the imperfections that existed before this edition was released are still present.  But that when all's said and done, this is the only cut that should have survived a triple-dip of DVD releases.  The fact that in his introduction, Oliver Stone asks us to 'enjoy every sublime and awkward pixel', leads us to reason that this still isn't the final product he had in mind, but this is as good as it's ever going to get.I always said that Alexander deserved to be given the ""Rome"" treatment, and that even at under 4 hours, it should have been longer.  Like Alexander, Oliver Stone's reach exceded his grasp, but not many other filmmakers would have had the chutzpah to try.The biggest problem this movie faced was its erratic casting.  Physically, Colin Farrell a shining gem of a leading man, but he's yet to prove he's much more than a pretty boy, possessing neither the charisma nor the acting chops to pull this role off (but it doesn't help that he's saddled down with some ham-handed lines).I give him credit however, for not many major actors in the world would have kissed another man onscreen for fear of being either being typecast or made to look like a fool.Much has been made of Angelina Jolie's ""ridiculous"" accent, and I agree that it's jarring, not to mention ridiculous--Stone had Farrell speak in his own Irish brogue, so why ask Jolie to sound like a modern day Irene Papas?  Neither she nor co-star Val Kilmer as King Phillip need any acting lessons, but both seem like they'd phoned in their parts.No such excuses for Jared Leto, who's only role seems to be to look worried and glance longingly at Alexander from time to time when we need reminding about sexual ambiguity.Another complaint is the inclusion of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy the Elder as a narrator, claiming that the use of a narrator is proof of bad writing (the idea that you need a narrator implies that the story needs to be explained to you), and generally that's a valid complaint, but in this movie, I think the use of narration adds to the gravitas--otherwise it's just another Colin Farrell flick.",4,The Ultimate Edition,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,2139,"['begin', 'should', 'first', 'state', 'most', 'imperfections', 'existed', 'edition', 'was', 'released', 'are', 'still', 'present', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'only', 'cut', 'should', 'have', 'survived', 'triple-dip', 'DVD', 'releases', 'fact', 'introduction', 'Oliver', 'Stone', ""'enjoy"", 'sublime', 'awkward', 'pixel', 'reason', 'still', ""n't"", 'final', 'product', 'had', 'mind', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'going', 'get.I', 'always', 'said', 'Alexander', 'deserved', 'be', 'given', 'Rome', 'treatment', 'even', '4', 'hours', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'Alexander', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'reach', 'exceded', 'grasp', 'not', 'many', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'chutzpah', 'try.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'faced', 'was', 'erratic', 'casting', 'Physically', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'shining', 'gem', 'leading', 'man', 'yet', 'prove', 'much', 'more', 'pretty', 'boy', 'possessing', 'charisma', 'acting', 'chops', 'pull', 'role', ""n't"", 'help', 'saddled', 'down', 'ham-handed', 'lines', '.I', 'give', 'credit', 'however', 'not', 'many', 'major', 'actors', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'kissed', 'man', 'onscreen', 'fear', 'being', 'being', 'typecast', 'made', 'look', 'fool.Much', 'been', 'made', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'ridiculous', 'accent', 'agree', 'jarring', 'not', 'mention', 'ridiculous', 'Stone', 'had', 'Farrell', 'speak', 'own', 'Irish', 'brogue', 'so', 'why', 'ask', 'Jolie', 'sound', 'modern', 'day', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'co-star', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'King', 'Phillip', 'need', 'acting', 'lessons', 'seem', ""'d"", 'phoned', 'parts.No', 'such', 'excuses', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'who', 'only', 'role', 'be', 'look', 'worried', 'glance', 'longingly', 'Alexander', 'time', 'time', 'when', 'need', 'reminding', 'sexual', 'ambiguity.Another', 'complaint', 'inclusion', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ptolemy', 'Elder', 'narrator', 'claiming', 'use', 'narrator', 'proof', 'bad', 'writing', 'idea', 'need', 'narrator', 'story', 'be', 'explained', 'generally', 'valid', 'complaint', 'movie', 'think', 'use', 'narration', 'gravitas', 'otherwise', 'just', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'flick']",Alexander

910235,APASOUCF2UD42,B0009PLLN6,Greg Curtis,"[9, 14]","Alexander is a biopic of the legendary warrior who, by the age of 25, ruled most of the known world and died -- not with a bang but a whimper -- at 32.Yet, in this interpretation, it is unclear exactly what made Alexander (played by Colin Farrell) a great leader. He may have conquered the world, but it was a world indifferent to conquest. His troops followed for the sake of Macedonia, as well as the legacy of his father, but they never believed in Alexander's vision. That comes as no wonder -- even his pre-battle pep talks lack any motivation.Alexander's success began with the destruction of the Persian forces, and ended with his own defeat in India, but these two battle scenes are marred by extreme close-ups and butchered editing. Director Oliver Stone seems so desperate to create art, his usual flair degenerates into a psychedelic nightmare with the Indian sequence tinted shocking pink. Further, with the now prevalent cinematic armies enhanced by CGI, the scope of these scenes fails to impress and inadvertently slows the film's pace.Despite much publicity, the film is not any more homo-erotic than Spartacus was 44 years ago. Though Alexander and his childhood friend Hephaestion (Jared Leto) vow their eternal love for one another, they never consummate their feelings. More questionable is Alexander's Oedipal relationship with his conniving stage mother (Angelina Jolie), who urged him to ""take the world"". Perhaps he pushed relentlessly eastward in an effort to distance himself from her.The pointless screenplay is filled with innumerable monologues of pensive thought and rationale, while the narration (by Anthony Hopkins) is not chronological, weaving forwards and backwards more than once.Thus, Hollywood's Golden Boy Farrell seems lost in the muddled storyline; he also looks ridiculous with platinum-blond hair. Jolie's performance is made all the more campy by her character's obsession with snakes, and Leto is ineffective at anything more than being fey. A bored Val Kilmer also appears as Alexander's drunken father, whose sole purpose is to spew misguided rhetoric.Curiously, the large cast represent enough different accents to fill the United Nations, but not one sounds Greek. And there are an unusual number of both unnervingly pretty men and scarred-eyed soldiers. Lastly, the new-age score by Vangelis is entirely inappropriate.Alexander starts out on a promising note, but becomes much less interesting when it tries to define his greatness. While idolizing Achilles (played earlier this year by Brad Pitt in an equally dreary film), Alexander himself aspired to God-hood. Sadly, happiness is one thing he never found.

Yes.  Another point, though: if violence and the full range of human sensuality and sexuality might offend, don't pick this up.  However, if you want to get a genuine feel for those violent and sensual times, I recommend this.Fortunately, too, the film utilized Robin Lane Fox, a biographer of Alexander, as a technical source.  So, even when Stone might have seemed to have pushed the edge here and there, historical context extisted in which to ground some of his interpretations--or there's no specific evidence either way and Stone's interpretation is as fair and truthful as anyone's.  And, at this point of human history, that's the best we can do.

To me this appeared to be a sell out by Oliver Stone to appease the negative reaction this film received on release and try and win over more people with extended battles and less homosexual overtones. The directors cut played out badly and missed important backstory and character development shown in the original version. Hearing a final uncut, full length version was to be released i purchased hoping Oliver had had a rethink and restored his film to its greater glory. Well i can happily say he did and more. This is the cut which despite its 3.5 hour running time should have been released at the beginning. Alexander and his relationships have been given greater attention here and it helps the audience gain a greater understanding of this flawed but valiant person.  The battle scenes have been extended and include some new graphic additions (a person being squashed to a pulp by an elephant being a memorable one) really adding to the scope and brutality of warfare. Colin Farrell does a great job however i felt Val Kilmer to be slightly weak and unbelievable.  Overall this is a fine film which makes a noble attempt at capturing the essence of one of history's most revered and mysterious figures. The elephant battle scene is one of the best ever committed to film. Oliver Stone confirmed he wanted to make a film like the old greats (Ben Hur) with the same large canas and epic vision. Whilst he has succeeded i cannot forgive him for taking three goes to get it right. I would of thought someone as gifted as him wouldn't have needed to do this and is very lucky Warner Bros have given him another chance.  I have not heard of anyone being this lucky before. Nevertheless i highly recommend this film for history buffs and battle fans who should rejoice in the fantastic canvas on display here.

The subtitles are absurd. ""MACEDONIAN LEFT"", means nothing to me. It's hard to tell who's winning the battle but the charging camels win best float in the parade, (I've yet to see the earth-shaking stampeding Indian elephants), ...Hell, Bush would have conquered Asia in half this time, ...There's a ""Gone With The Wind"" dead battlefield nod. Nice. ...I'm in Persia now. Alexander is falling in love  ... with everybody. Nothing like a little Greek debauchery. Better lock up the camels and snakes. ...

I know I cannot reach that level of perfection so it's easy to criticise another's work.When you're making a film on Alexander you expect everything to be larger than life yet quite close to most people's perception of reality. Colin Farrell made a weak, very disappointing, disillusioning Alexander. I wanted to like this film but the very character that played the lead role failed to remotely bring justice to the king of kings.I enjoyed the film at first and tried my best to ignore the over obsessive Angelina Jolie who played the role of Olympus. Let me just say the half impish Russian accent she sported did no good for outlining her character.The war scenes in the film aren't really anything like we haven't ever seen before.There is nothing the film tries to over emphasise on. I could take this film seriously for the 160 minutes of it's playing time.The person who played the Persian King was more fit for his role than any other person in this film. Babylon was shown with a lot of glory and quite rightfully so.I hear from a lot of people that the story is twisted in it's own way. Alexander wasn't murdered they say. I do not believe it is correct to diss the film on this basis. The best scene in the film comes when Alexander's 40,000 army fights the 250,000. There is a shot of an eagle flying in the sky and the camera is focussed on the war below from the eagle's eye.Watch this film if you saw Troy and must watch everything that is focussed on an ancient epic tale of a leader of men. Colin Farrell gave his 90% to this film but then his capacity fails him from personifying Alexander. A friend mentioned the actor of Van Helsing would have made a better Alexander.

To name some: Colin Farrell is miscast as Alexander. It is impossible to have hair that blond and eyes that dark brown unless you're an Italian woman dress designer. I should think that casting Alexander would be almost impossible, but Farrell isn't the one. Angelina Jolie at times is a commanding figure as his mother Olympias, but she speaks with a strange accent and couldn't possibly be old enough to be his mother.

The battle sequences in the desert against Dario troops are first class and so the last fight in India where the frozen image must have been recognized by Akira Kurosawa wherever he is. The splendid images in red after Alexander being wounded was another hit to remark. The most disgusting failure of the fil is the obsessive tendence of the scripters to remind the sexual inclinations of Alexander and not about his trascencence as conqueror and epic spirit man; that would suppose for instance to denigrate about the genius of Michelangelo due his sexual inclinations, leaving outside the gretaness of his legacy.Two additional details affect seriously the movie as a whole. In the first half there is an excessive use of close-ups. In my modest opinion the close up is like rubato in music: just what you need to emphasize dramatic nucleus or remark the dramatis personae. The second is the presence of Rosario Dawson. To my mind she doesn't represent the Asiatic stereotype ; in the other hand she didn't live the role: too cold and inexpressive.The rest of the cast was really interesting. The highlights performances are for Angelina Jolie who gives a perfect portrait of Olympia; she exploited her erotic face but also revealed the absolute domain of the body language: the expressive eyes delineated her speech. Jared Leto made a wonderful portrait and finally Val Killmer as Filipo was memorable too.Edition, photography and artistic direction are outstanding.

If you are going to make him gay then make him out of the closet Liberace gay.  Not the ham-handed attempt done in this film.  He won't actually fight in any battles but his song will inspire his men or his Muppets.  In a weird twist Miss Piggy will be one of the wives but they will both be after Kermit the Frog the young warrior.  Kermit will be straight and won't have anything to do with either of them.The rest of the Muppet cast will serve as Alexander's army.  The cranky old guys will rip on this movie but will be forced to concede that the Muppet version of the movie is much better than this farce.You will need someone to play Alexander's mom.  Let's see Elton John is old so lets cast Britney Spears in that role.  That ought to bring some bubble headed nonsense to mirror Angelina Jolie's role.  For Philip of Macedon that will be hard.  Val Kilmer actually put some effort into bringing that role to life.  Maybe Al Pacino would take part.

910247,A30KGYUOZRUCRJ,B0009PLLN6,Hulka,"[11, 14]","It's not hard to see why this movie did so poorly at the box office. If you view this movie in the context of the Hollywood HYPE surrounding it, you are going to be sadly disappointed. The hype of the movie was ""The greatest legend of all was real!"" ads trumpeted, and ""Fortune favors the bold!""  The public was led to expect a Hollywood blockbuster HERO for us to cheer for.Instead of Alexander the GREAT, we get Alexander, the flawed commander, the vain, the self deluded. And worse, he's a sexually confused homosexual, suffering incestuous emotional attachment to his overbearing mother and alienated from his emotionally distant father. Certainly not a conventional hero. Worse, Oliver Stone's script leaves you with the impression that Alexander's legacy not a triumph, but a tragedy!Without a doubt, if this movie missed the mark, it was because of OLIVER STONE's politically skewed script! We might forgive Stone if he made an historically accurate movie, but he didn't.There are 2 big problems with Stone's skewed script. First, Stone's emphasis on an Alexander afflicted with a severe fraudian opedial complex. Secondly, his portrayal of Alexander motivations as vain glory seeking personal ambition.According to Stone, Alexander is in love with his mother, hates his father...everyone is acquainted with that quaint Freudian theory. In fact, the interaction between Alexander his mother Olympias, and his father Phillip was probably not as sexually charged as cosmopolitan sophisticates like Stone might imagine. The historical Phillip had 6 wives, of which Alexander's mother was the 4th, not to mention numberous  illegitimate siblings and half-siblings. It's most likely that sexual tension was probably the least important motivator in polygamous families in ancient Greece. As in modern polygamous societies, all the arguments in the marriage are about status, not sex. Any disrespect of Alexander's mother called into question the legitimacy of her offspring to succession. Stone's psycho-sexual interpretation of Alexander's is a speculation that is not only overly done, but mostly likely unrealistic.The second flaw in the script Stone's portrayal of Alexander as an aristocratic brat with no concern but to sacrifice his army to his ambition to conquor the world. Alexander's victories are not portrayed as a result of his military genius and personal leadership, but as bloody sacrifices of soldiers to his dreams of vain glory.Stone's puts a lot of emphasis on the tensions between Alexander and his Generals and his soldiers, which, like Stone's interpretation of Alexander's opedial complex, is probably a figment of Stone's own 60s' era bias against military heroism.Alexander's awesome victory of Gaugamela against overwhelming Persian superior numbers is summed up in the scene of a young soldier so gravely wounded that the kindest act Alexander can offer is to put him out of his misery. Victory over thousands is thus reduced to the tragedy of one man. Instead of cheering, the audience is encouraged to weeping, along with Alexander. Stone's treatment of battle of the Hydaspes is equally proposterous.Again, we might excuse slanting Alexander's political and military accomplishments if this was the historically accurate. But it's not. In ancient Macedonia's gift-exchange culture, loyalty to a King was purchased with slaves and loot. A warrior people like the Macedonians wanted a warrior king who won battles, because winning battles meant loot. A Macedonan King retained his throne by giving people what they wanted---victory and loot, the expected rewards in a gift-exchange society.If the historical Alexander had any fatal flaw it wasn't that he failed to live up to the expectations of his followers, but that he didn't know when to stop! But that's not quite how Stone portrayed the conflicts between Alexander, his generals and soldiers.Stone even missed the mark even on Alexander's love life. The character of Alexander's alleged homosexual lover-confidant Hephaistion is so undeveloped that the relationship is barely recognizable in the movie, except to history buffs. The wedding night bedroom scene with a snarling Persian wife, Roxanne borders on cartoonish.Stone has given us far more politically biased movies...such as such as ""Nixon"" or ""JFK"" or ""Born on the Fourth of July"". Buy the movie for the gorgious photography, the action scenes, the historically accurate costumes, sets and props--they are ALL wonderful! If you view this movie expecting the flaws, you might even enjoy it.",3,Stone's script is deeply flawed.....,1134259200,"12 11, 2005",2005,4538,"['not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'did', 'so', 'poorly', 'box', 'office', 'view', 'movie', 'context', 'Hollywood', 'HYPE', 'surrounding', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'hype', 'movie', 'was', 'greatest', 'legend', 'was', 'real', 'ads', 'trumpeted', 'Fortune', 'bold', 'public', 'was', 'led', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'HERO', 'cheer', 'for.Instead', 'Alexander', 'GREAT', 'get', 'Alexander', 'flawed', 'commander', 'vain', 'self', 'deluded', 'worse', 'sexually', 'confused', 'homosexual', 'suffering', 'incestuous', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'alienated', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'father', 'Certainly', 'not', 'conventional', 'hero', 'Worse', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'script', 'impression', 'Alexander', 'legacy', 'not', 'triumph', 'tragedy', 'doubt', 'movie', 'missed', 'mark', 'was', 'OLIVER', 'STONE', 'politically', 'skewed', 'script', 'might', 'forgive', 'Stone', 'made', 'historically', 'accurate', 'movie', ""didn't.There"", 'are', '2', 'big', 'problems', 'Stone', 'skewed', 'script', 'First', 'Stone', 'emphasis', 'Alexander', 'afflicted', 'severe', 'fraudian', 'opedial', 'complex', 'Secondly', 'portrayal', 'Alexander', 'motivations', 'vain', 'glory', 'seeking', 'personal', 'ambition.According', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'love', 'mother', 'father', 'everyone', 'acquainted', 'quaint', 'Freudian', 'theory', 'fact', 'interaction', 'Alexander', 'mother', 'Olympias', 'father', 'Phillip', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'sexually', 'charged', 'cosmopolitan', 'sophisticates', 'Stone', 'might', 'imagine', 'historical', 'Phillip', 'had', '6', 'wives', 'Alexander', 'mother', 'was', '4th', 'not', 'mention', 'numberous', 'illegitimate', 'siblings', 'half-siblings', 'most', 'likely', 'sexual', 'tension', 'was', 'probably', 'least', 'important', 'motivator', 'polygamous', 'families', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'modern', 'polygamous', 'societies', 'arguments', 'marriage', 'are', 'status', 'not', 'sex', 'disrespect', 'Alexander', 'mother', 'called', 'question', 'legitimacy', 'offspring', 'succession', 'Stone', 'psycho-sexual', 'interpretation', 'Alexander', 'speculation', 'not', 'only', 'overly', 'done', 'mostly', 'likely', 'unrealistic.The', 'second', 'flaw', 'script', 'Stone', 'portrayal', 'Alexander', 'aristocratic', 'brat', 'concern', 'sacrifice', 'army', 'ambition', 'conquor', 'world', 'Alexander', 'victories', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'result', 'military', 'genius', 'personal', 'leadership', 'bloody', 'sacrifices', 'soldiers', 'dreams', 'vain', 'glory.Stone', 'lot', 'emphasis', 'tensions', 'Alexander', 'Generals', 'soldiers', 'Stone', 'interpretation', 'Alexander', 'opedial', 'complex', 'probably', 'figment', 'Stone', 'own', '60s', 'era', 'bias', 'military', 'heroism.Alexander', 'awesome', 'victory', 'Gaugamela', 'overwhelming', 'Persian', 'superior', 'numbers', 'summed', 'up', 'scene', 'young', 'soldier', 'so', 'gravely', 'wounded', 'kindest', 'act', 'Alexander', 'can', 'offer', 'put', 'misery', 'Victory', 'thousands', 'thus', 'reduced', 'tragedy', 'one', 'man', 'Instead', 'cheering', 'audience', 'encouraged', 'weeping', 'Alexander', 'Stone', 'treatment', 'battle', 'Hydaspes', 'equally', 'proposterous.Again', 'might', 'excuse', 'slanting', 'Alexander', 'political', 'military', 'accomplishments', 'was', 'historically', 'accurate', 'not', 'ancient', 'Macedonia', 'gift-exchange', 'culture', 'loyalty', 'King', 'was', 'purchased', 'slaves', 'loot', 'A', 'warrior', 'people', 'Macedonians', 'wanted', 'warrior', 'king', 'who', 'won', 'battles', 'winning', 'battles', 'meant', 'loot', 'Macedonan', 'King', 'retained', 'throne', 'giving', 'people', 'what', 'wanted', '-victory', 'loot', 'expected', 'rewards', 'gift-exchange', 'society.If', 'historical', 'Alexander', 'had', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'was', ""n't"", 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'followers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'not', 'quite', 'how', 'Stone', 'portrayed', 'conflicts', 'Alexander', 'generals', 'soldiers.Stone', 'even', 'missed', 'mark', 'even', 'Alexander', 'love', 'life', 'character', 'Alexander', 'alleged', 'homosexual', 'lover-confidant', 'Hephaistion', 'so', 'undeveloped', 'relationship', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'movie', 'history', 'buffs', 'wedding', 'night', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'snarling', 'Persian', 'wife', 'Roxanne', 'borders', 'cartoonish.Stone', 'given', 'far', 'more', 'politically', 'biased', 'movies', 'such', 'such', 'Nixon', 'JFK', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Buy', 'movie', 'gorgious', 'photography', 'action', 'scenes', 'historically', 'accurate', 'costumes', 'sets', 'props', 'are', 'wonderful', 'view', 'movie', 'expecting', 'flaws', 'might', 'even', 'enjoy']",Alexander

None of the other ""Macedonian warriors"" look so absurd. Why? I'll just leave it there. In the battle-scenes with stirring music he's still badly choreographed and too short compared to the extras. QUO VADIS way back when in B&W; with Peter Ustinov as Nero was better for decadence at court.

I liked that the director stayed true to history about many things, but then again many things were not accurate like for example Alexander did not have blond hair...and its most likely he did more than hug his gay lover...The battle scene against the Persians was historically accurate but it was too drawn out just like alot of other stuff. He could have made it more entertaining while staying historically accurate.I've seen plenty of good historical movies and tv shows that stay accurate to history and are also entertaining...its just the way they are written that makes or breaks it, and unfortunately Oliver stone missed the mark here.The director tried to explain why Alexander was troubled by showing how his parents influences created contradictions within  himself and how he got more paranoid over the course of the story...I just think Oliver Stone got lost in way too many details...and skipped over many battle scenes.I thought the battle in India was kind of cool. I just didn't like how Oliver stone kept skipping into the past for very long periods of time and then coming back into the present again. I'm not a fan of that style of story telling...just a personal preference imo.the movie could have been alot better. I think the downfall of the movie was that Oliver Stone was trying to please too many different types of people...he was trying to please the historians, was trying to please the average movie goer, was trying to please the gay community, was trying to please the anti-gay community by not showing gay sex....in the end no one was happy.",2,could have been better,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,1653,"[""'m"", 'history', 'major', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'kind', 'boring', 'side', 'liked', 'director', 'stayed', 'true', 'history', 'many', 'things', 'then', 'again', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'accurate', 'example', 'Alexander', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'blond', 'hair', 'most', 'likely', 'did', 'more', 'hug', 'gay', 'lover', 'battle', 'scene', 'Persians', 'was', 'historically', 'accurate', 'was', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', 'just', 'alot', 'other', 'stuff', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'entertaining', 'staying', 'historically', 'accurate.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'good', 'historical', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'stay', 'accurate', 'history', 'are', 'also', 'entertaining', 'just', 'way', 'are', 'written', 'breaks', 'unfortunately', 'Oliver', 'stone', 'missed', 'mark', 'here.The', 'director', 'tried', 'explain', 'why', 'Alexander', 'was', 'troubled', 'showing', 'how', 'parents', 'influences', 'created', 'contradictions', 'how', 'got', 'more', 'paranoid', 'course', 'story', 'just', 'think', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'got', 'lost', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'skipped', 'many', 'battle', 'scenes.I', 'thought', 'battle', 'India', 'was', 'kind', 'cool', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'Oliver', 'stone', 'kept', 'skipping', 'past', 'very', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'then', 'coming', 'back', 'present', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'style', 'story', 'telling', 'just', 'personal', 'preference', 'imo.the', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'alot', 'better', 'think', 'downfall', 'movie', 'was', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'was', 'trying', 'please', 'too', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'people', 'was', 'trying', 'please', 'historians', 'was', 'trying', 'please', 'average', 'movie', 'goer', 'was', 'trying', 'please', 'gay', 'community', 'was', 'trying', 'please', 'anti-gay', 'community', 'not', 'showing', 'gay', 'sex', 'end', 'one', 'was', 'happy']",Alexander

Yes, the movie is kind of, um, problematic; but it's a noble failure, a courageous train-wreck, and it has some fine things in it.  Give it credit for sheer nerve.I don't know why everyone is complaining about Angelina Jolie's zany Russian accent: I thought it was a daring choice (and I could understand why she did it); her performance was big and smart, and pretty remarkable.  And plus, it was just such a darn corker, I couldn't help applauding.  (It made me nostalgic for Priscilla Smith's legendary turn as Medea at the La Mama theatre in New York.)  When people take chances this huge, yes, they risk falling on their face; but I'd rather see an artist take a chance and fail, than play it safe and be dull.  Granted, this is not a straight-up-the-middle ""good"" movie, but I'm glad somebody made a big-budget movie that wasn't.  I'd rather watch this sort of weirdness than ""Gladiator,"" even though ""Gladiator"" is more of what you'd call a good job.There's good mixed in with bad here, and if you forget trying to make ""good sense"" of the whole thing, and just enjoy the strange details, it's sort of rewarding.  The one thing I wish is that the filmmakers had gotten it a bit more clear in their heads exactly WHY they were making this thing.  The story is so huge and convulsive, it's difficult to make much sense out of it as a ""story,"" and a lot of the leaden excuses Alex & Co. make about 'accepting other cultures' and 'liberating' people seemed unconvincing.  Was there some allegorical message I was supposed to be clued in on?  Or political sarcasm?  A veiled critique of Mr. Bush's misadventures in the Mideast?  We'll never know.But it's almost better that way.  Bottom line: if you want to be ""entertained,"" you probably won't be.  If you want an edifying artistic or historical experience, nope, you're out of luck there, too.  What you WILL get is a kind of top-notch, expensive, high-quality daffiness.

910253,A3GCB8Y46TXO0A,B0009PLLN6,Jacob Cloud,"[18, 21]","When Roger Ebert reviewed this film, he made the following statement, ""[Stone] gives us provocative notes and sketches but not a final draft. The film doesn't feel at ease with itself. It says too much, and yet leaves too much unsaid.""  I fully agree.  Ebert gave the film two stars; yet, as you can see, I have given the film four.  Please allow me to explain.The first time a started to watch this film, I had no idea what it was about, I had very little knowledge of the 'Alexander' story, and I had heard the film was reviewed poorly.  To be totally honest, I made it about half way through and then shut it off.  I found it to be long, tedious, overly complex, and down right boring.  Names were being said and places were being mentioned, and I had no idea who was referring to whom or what.  Aaaahhhhhh!  Accordingly, if someone had asked my opinion, at that time, I would have probably given this film one star, at best.Some months down the road, however, I began to explore the 'Alexander' legend.  In response, I had ordered a book from Amazon by Robin Lane Fox, titled 'Alexander the Great.' As I later came to find out, this was the exact book Oliver Stone used as the inspiration for his movie.  I read the book, enjoyed it, and then went back to view Stone's film.  Upon the second viewing, I enjoyed the film immensely.  Of course, with this second viewing, I came in with a great deal of background knowledge.  As a result, the names and places, etc. were familiar to me, which provided me with a much need frame of reference.  Knowing that Stone's film was inspired by Fox's book, I was able to understand Stone's direction, etc.  In short, if you are watching, or thinking about watching, this movie because you want to be entertained by another action packed gladiator movie, DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE!  However, if you are interested in Greek history, and the spread of Hellenism, I would recommend that you read a history book first, such as Fox's.  If you enjoy Fox's book, and would be interested in watching a cinematic 'version' of it, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM.All this to say, Ebert is right.  This movie is an unfinished group of cinematic sketches and notes.  In order to understand, and appreciate these 'sketches and notes,' one has to read Fox's book... then it will all make sense - well at least more sense.  I, however, realize that very few people will be willing to read a five hundred page book just to make sense out of a movie. Oh well... And there are, of course, some key battles and/or victories that Stone leaves out (or doesn't properly address) in his film, but, when making a movie, time is always a factor.",4,The movie and the book...,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,2658,"['When', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'reviewed', 'film', 'made', 'following', 'statement', '[', 'Stone', ']', 'provocative', 'notes', 'sketches', 'not', 'final', 'draft', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ease', 'too', 'much', 'yet', 'too', 'much', 'unsaid', 'fully', 'agree', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'yet', 'can', 'see', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'four', 'Please', 'allow', 'explain.The', 'first', 'time', 'started', 'watch', 'film', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'knowledge', ""'Alexander"", 'story', 'had', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'reviewed', 'poorly', 'be', 'totally', 'honest', 'made', 'half', 'way', 'then', 'shut', 'off', 'found', 'be', 'long', 'tedious', 'overly', 'complex', 'down', 'right', 'boring', 'Names', 'were', 'being', 'said', 'places', 'were', 'being', 'mentioned', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'was', 'referring', 'whom', 'what', 'Aaaahhhhhh', 'Accordingly', 'someone', 'had', 'asked', 'opinion', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'given', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'best.Some', 'months', 'road', 'however', 'began', 'explore', ""'Alexander"", 'legend', 'response', 'had', 'ordered', 'book', 'Amazon', 'Robin', 'Lane', 'Fox', 'titled', 'Great', 'later', 'came', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'exact', 'book', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'used', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'enjoyed', 'then', 'went', 'back', 'view', 'Stone', 'film', 'second', 'viewing', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'immensely', 'course', 'second', 'viewing', 'came', 'great', 'deal', 'background', 'knowledge', 'result', 'names', 'places', 'etc', 'were', 'familiar', 'provided', 'much', 'need', 'frame', 'reference', 'Knowing', 'Stone', 'film', 'was', 'inspired', 'Fox', 'book', 'was', 'able', 'understand', 'Stone', 'direction', 'etc', 'short', 'are', 'watching', 'thinking', 'watching', 'movie', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'action', 'packed', 'gladiator', 'movie', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'BOTHER', 'WITH', 'THIS', 'ONE', 'However', 'are', 'interested', 'Greek', 'history', 'spread', 'Hellenism', 'would', 'recommend', 'read', 'history', 'book', 'first', 'such', 'Fox', 'enjoy', 'Fox', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'watching', 'cinematic', ""'version"", 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMEND', 'THIS', 'FILM.All', 'say', 'Ebert', 'right', 'movie', 'unfinished', 'group', 'cinematic', 'sketches', 'notes', 'order', 'understand', 'appreciate', ""'sketches"", 'notes', 'one', 'read', 'Fox', 'book', 'then', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'well', 'least', 'more', 'sense', 'however', 'realize', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'willing', 'read', 'five', 'hundred', 'page', 'book', 'just', 'make', 'sense', 'movie', 'Oh', 'well', 'are', 'course', 'key', 'battles', 'and/or', 'victories', 'Stone', 'out', ""n't"", 'properly', 'address', 'film', 'when', 'making', 'movie', 'time', 'always', 'factor']",Alexander

Don't be put off by the jabs of spoiled movie critics - watch this lavish and engrossing film, and enjoy!The only flaw I saw with the film - and it may be an insurmountable one - is that so much went on in Alexander's life, that it is probably impossible to present it all in a single movie.  Stone gives us a glimpse into the political, military, and personal aspects of Alexander's story, and these really can't be fully appreciated unless one has first familiarized oneself by reading the various accounts of Alexander, especially those written by his ancient biographers.  I may be reading too much into it, but I think the central theme of the Stone film is given us when, on Alexander's wedding night, he responds to his new bride""s question about whether he loves Hephaestion by saying, ""There are many kinds of love, Roxane.""  Oliver Stone's Alexander has many loves - his father, his mother, Hephaestion, Bagoas, the army, glory, war, his vision of a united world empire - and his attempts to give full devotion to each one drive his extraordinary career and, it would seem, eventually lead to his own self-destruction.",4,An exciting glimpse into Alexander the Great's story,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,1485,"['simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'vitriol', 'been', 'heaped', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Alexander', 'theatre', 'only', 'experience', 'director', 'cut', 'DVD', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'brought', 'Alexander', 'times', 'life', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'putting', 'human', 'face', 'man', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'god', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'jabs', 'spoiled', 'movie', 'critics', 'watch', 'lavish', 'engrossing', 'film', 'enjoy', 'only', 'flaw', 'saw', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'insurmountable', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'went', 'Alexander', 'life', 'probably', 'impossible', 'present', 'single', 'movie', 'Stone', 'glimpse', 'political', 'military', 'personal', 'aspects', 'Alexander', 'story', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'one', 'first', 'familiarized', 'reading', 'various', 'accounts', 'Alexander', 'especially', 'written', 'ancient', 'biographers', 'may', 'be', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'central', 'theme', 'Stone', 'film', 'given', 'when', 'Alexander', 'wedding', 'night', 'new', 'bride', 's', 'question', 'Hephaestion', 'saying', 'are', 'many', 'kinds', 'love', 'Roxane', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'many', 'loves', 'father', 'mother', 'Hephaestion', 'Bagoas', 'army', 'glory', 'war', 'vision', 'united', 'world', 'empire', 'attempts', 'give', 'full', 'devotion', 'one', 'drive', 'extraordinary', 'career', 'would', 'seem', 'eventually', 'lead', 'own', 'self-destruction']",Alexander

How many of the same people who complained about this film because it contained some sexual scenes between two males, have complained about sex scenes between heterosexuals?  Some people even complained that there were scenes where Alexander and a male buddy gave eachother certain suggestive stares.  Well, how many movies that you have seen recently that contained the same things I stated above, but between heterosexuals?  How many nude scenes have you seen in films laterly which contained heterosexuals?  If you are going to complained about this film because of two males being sexually active or giving eachother certain looks, then also write a bunch of negative reviews about other films that contained heterosexuals doing the same thing.  Yes, this is not a good film, and yes it could have been better.  But, it had nothing to do with whether or not they were any gay scenes in them.  It just had to do with bad scripts, bad make up, fake looking hairdos, and a director who needed to be more brave and enhance certain parts of the movie and not just rush through it.

910258,A1TRC9QL61LNTV,B0009PLLN6,"James ""John""","[3, 3]","First off, I did enjoy this movie, aside from seeing Colin Farrels balls it was a great movie. What many do not understand is that there are different views as to the personality of Alexander depending on which historian you read or what culture is telling stories about him. For instance in Persia he is equivalent to the boogie man for children. The historian Arrian portrays Alexander as a hero, and in many aspects he was. Rufinius portrays him more as a tyrant given to excess. Stone had a monumental task at hand, trying to blend these all together to try and form a cohesive mix of all these views.Alexanders hair was described as being like &#34;The mane of a lion&#34; so he is portrayed in that sense accurately. He was said to have two different colored eyes, this is not shown in the film. Arrian describes him as a man of great restraint, not given to excess, and this makes sense because he was tutored by Aristotle for many years and was a firm believer in Aristotles teachings. As for drunkenness, you have to remember that the drinking water was not exactly on par with todays standard and therefore many people drank wine instead of water. In Macedonian culture they mixed wine and water, the sulfites in the wine would usually ensure that no bacteria or protazoa would survive.I did not particularly care for the portrayal of Alexanders father, Phillip II. He was a brilliant man that took the throne in Macedonia when it had no army and virtually no resources. He redefined warfare by creating a Phalanx that was more mobile, easy to train, and a longer pike at about 18ft long. He was described as charismatic and well spoken and that he was always &#34;clear headed.&#34; Only his enemies described him as being a drunk womanizing homosexual. This was only an attempt to demonize Phillip because Macedonia was hated by the other Greek states. That being said I still think Kilmer did a great job with what he was given.People should relax and read some history before they criticize the movie. It is not 100% accurate but Stone clearly tried and this movie is more accurate than, say, Agora which was so full of lies I literally got sick to my stomach. But, you have to remember, some history is debatable, especially when there are conflicting sources so you cannot expect a movie to be 100% accurate given that. Stone did not pick one source and say, &#34;This is Alexander&#34; he clearly did his research and did his best to portray him using all sources available.",5,A lot of flak from armchair historians,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,2491,"['First', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'aside', 'seeing', 'Colin', 'Farrels', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'What', 'many', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'are', 'different', 'views', 'personality', 'Alexander', 'depending', 'historian', 'read', 'what', 'culture', 'telling', 'stories', 'instance', 'Persia', 'equivalent', 'boogie', 'man', 'children', 'historian', 'Arrian', 'Alexander', 'hero', 'many', 'aspects', 'was', 'Rufinius', 'more', 'tyrant', 'given', 'excess', 'Stone', 'had', 'monumental', 'task', 'hand', 'trying', 'blend', 'together', 'try', 'form', 'cohesive', 'mix', 'views.Alexanders', 'hair', 'was', 'described', 'being', '34', 'mane', 'lion', '34', 'so', 'portrayed', 'sense', 'accurately', 'was', 'said', 'have', 'two', 'different', 'colored', 'eyes', 'not', 'shown', 'film', 'Arrian', 'man', 'great', 'restraint', 'not', 'given', 'excess', 'sense', 'was', 'tutored', 'Aristotle', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'firm', 'believer', 'Aristotles', 'teachings', 'drunkenness', 'have', 'remember', 'drinking', 'water', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'par', 'todays', 'standard', 'therefore', 'many', 'people', 'drank', 'wine', 'instead', 'water', 'Macedonian', 'culture', 'mixed', 'wine', 'water', 'sulfites', 'wine', 'would', 'usually', 'ensure', 'bacteria', 'protazoa', 'would', 'survive.I', 'did', 'not', 'particularly', 'care', 'portrayal', 'Alexanders', 'father', 'Phillip', 'II', 'was', 'brilliant', 'man', 'took', 'throne', 'Macedonia', 'when', 'had', 'army', 'virtually', 'resources', 'redefined', 'warfare', 'creating', 'Phalanx', 'was', 'more', 'mobile', 'easy', 'train', 'longer', 'pike', '18ft', 'long', 'was', 'described', 'charismatic', 'well', 'spoken', 'was', 'always', '34', 'clear', 'headed.', '34', 'Only', 'enemies', 'described', 'being', 'drunk', 'womanizing', 'homosexual', 'was', 'only', 'attempt', 'demonize', 'Phillip', 'Macedonia', 'was', 'hated', 'other', 'Greek', 'states', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'think', 'Kilmer', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'what', 'was', 'given.People', 'should', 'relax', 'read', 'history', 'criticize', 'movie', 'not', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'Stone', 'clearly', 'tried', 'movie', 'more', 'accurate', 'say', 'Agora', 'was', 'so', 'full', 'lies', 'literally', 'got', 'sick', 'stomach', 'have', 'remember', 'history', 'debatable', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'conflicting', 'sources', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'movie', 'be', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'given', 'Stone', 'did', 'not', 'pick', 'one', 'source', 'say', '34', 'Alexander', '34', 'clearly', 'did', 'research', 'did', 'best', 'portray', 'using', 'sources', 'available']",Alexander

I have read their were several scenes of nudity and bisexuality in the theatrical version that will not be seen in this Director's Cut DVD version due to the fact Oliver Stone cut the scenes out.***Warning:  This particular Disc froze 1 hour and 25 minutes into the film after Colin says, ""I wonder...did you ever love him?"".  It froze on Angelina Jolie's reaction and skipped 9 minutes of footage.If you see black space followed by the map of Hindu Kush, your DVD has skipped 9 minutes of important scenes.

You would think that a great mind like Oliver Stone's would do something special with the story of one of history's most fascinating, least understood characters, but instead this movie is one convoluted mess. It wastes many talented actors (Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Christopher Plummer, need I go on?) and mis-casts Colin Ferrell in a role that proves once and for all that the guy just can not act. The film is disjointed and careens wildly from gory battles, to confusing flashbacks, to yet another boring monologue by Alexander trying to rally his troops to keep on keeping on. If the real Alexander was so quirky and lacking in charisma, his troops would have turned around and gone home. Alexander must have been a mesmerizing persona to have done the things he did, but Colin Ferrell's portrayal isn't even good enough to call ""lackluster."" I suppose Stone had lots of grand ambitions for this sprawling film and talked quite a few people into participating in his vision. Unfortunately, his vision is obscured by a messy, confusing, unpleasant, and totally dissatisfying film.

Some people even claimed not to be homophobic, but went ahead and complained about some scenes that made them uncomfortable.  Well let me say to all these people this. I am not gay, but I for one will not complaine about any sexual scens, or two guys giving eachother certain looks, because for one thing they were not that many of those scenes in the film.  I am so sick and tired of people being so hypocritical of homosexuals, that it really makes me very upset.  I couldn't count just how many times that I have seen heteros kissing eachother while waiting to place an order at restaurants (which sickens me), kissing and having sex in many films (if not all of them in modern age), woman's bare breasts being shown in films, or full frontal nude scenes (mainly femals are shown) in films, sexual innuendos in films, and suggestive glances in films.  Some of the items listed above can be seen and heard on t.v. also.  How many people who wrote negatively about gay scenes ever written negative reviews about movies which involves heterosexual sex scenses, even if they are just minor scenes in the film?  If you are even uncomforable about two gay people holding hands, then are you also against two heteros holding hands with eachother?  Don't be so hypocritic!The film itself could have been much better.  But, I applaud Oliver Stone for making this kind of film. I think in some ways he was very brave to do so.  I just wished that the film was more like Dances with Wolves.  Dances with Wolves was a long movie, but because it contained beautiful sceneries, great acting and well written scripts, this film actually moved very quickly.  In Alexander, I think the actors and actresses did what they could with this scripts that they were given. I also think the makeup and hairdos could have been better and more natural looking.

910263,A17E28QEX42YU0,B0009PLLN6,"Jason ""Hastaj00""","[32, 39]","Stone's 'Alexander' has probably become more of a semi-obsession for myself than any other film of the past few years, and even though I'm not entirely convinced it's a GREAT film, I will stubbornly defend it -- or perhaps, reasonably express my admiration -- when criticism comes a'knockin'.Reading so many comments on the film here and other places, some things boggle my mind. For starters -- the acting. How anyone could dare say the overall acting of the picture is bad is beyond me. Personally, I was not disappointed with any of the actors. And, truly, I think that as one watches the film more than once, they have more of an appreciation for the nuance captured within many of the characters. Jolie's character is a perfect example -- initially it's difficult to stomach her bizzare accent and seemingly over-the-top portrayal of Olympias, but after a few watches, it seems disrespectful and almost naive in dismissing her whole performance as merely 'ham-fisted' (that said, one thing that I still believe would have worked better is to cast an older actress for the part giving a more realistic age seperation with Alexander and his mother). It's these type of superficial first impressions that I think lend the film so much of its tremendously negative reputation.Now, here is where I transition from forgiving to spiteful lambast at those who forsake the film with ludicrous, hateful spewings of unintelligence (and again, this is of course not all that dislike the film). In a day when few big-budgeted Hollywood films prove to be anything more than narcissistic, sophomoric celluloid, an ambitious, trying project like 'Alexander' comes along and gets cut to pieces. To me, 'so' few films capture the passionate energy that 'Alexander' possesses. 'So' few... Really. While there are definitely problems amidst its entirety, I have a hard time imagining some of the scenes in the film don't leave some viewers breathless. For example, the taut, confrontational bits (Alexander with Philip in Macedonia; Alexander with Cleitus in India) are some of the most expertly directed and acted I've seen in many a year. Remarkably edited and scored, with a raw verve that rarely comes about in a picture of this type, I can't help but be impressed each time these particular scenes come up. Perhaps even more arresting moments come from the battle sequences. The battle scenes, to me, are admirable first and foremost for the amount of detail shown within each shot, which proves to be an endlessly impressive feat that Stone ruthlessly strives for through the film (in and out of blood ridden chaos). Where so many epics are satisfied with visually zoning in on more focused matters (a technique that works to great effect when properly used), as to perhaps confine finances, 'Alexander' is always displaying its huge, wondrous and interesting Universe, which for me makes the film epic beyond epic. And yet, this sort of macro-vision makes for a restraint that allows the more intimite moments to capture that much more drama. As Alexander leaps on his horse and manically lurches after King Darius near the conclusion of the film's first battle sequence, Stone employs a cliche slow-motion effect that transcends its stereotype because the technique is withheld for some fifteen odd minutes up until that point. Courtesy a striking cue by Vangelis -- who's score is utterly invaluable to the theatrics herein -- what would appear hackneyed in lesser hands comes off as rousing in Stone's assertion. It's these widespread moments of artistry and cinematic virtue that make 'Alexander' what it is for me.Where 'Alexander' faults more than anything I think is within its narrative, but again more viewings really evoke the sense of scale here -- it's SUCH a big film, with so much ambition, that it almost eats its own tail. Like most of my favorite films, one sitting just isn't enough, and even if you find yourself with complete distaste initially, chances are you would find at least some things to admire if you gave it another try, or at minimum respect it for its drive and aspirations. Furthermore the political subtext here doesn't seem to be that profound, and truthfully I take the film merely as a fictional account of a historical figure, while taking its historical accuracy with but a grain of salt (perhaps I am wrong in doing this, but I am no expert on the subject and care not to read the endless amounts of information, then attempting to decide what's 'right'). In this light, I believe it allows oneself to get past the debatably undeniable fact that Farrell's Alexander really isn't the type of leader any of us would have imagined (then again, he was so young -- I don't know how I could even conjure up a realistic character of such an age who conquered the known world). Even so, this is basically the bottom line for me: I really do love this film for its utter passion by near everyone involved, but if I had to write a seven page essay on the elements of the film I had quarrels with, I could.

Taken from the works of dozen of writers, his epic is the finest composite of the mythic hero as could be fashioned. Once completed, the film must now survive the gauntlet of criticisms, opinions and censorship. Although the story is as factual as could be put to cellulose, many historical inaccuracies appear. Still the result is incredible. The selection of Colin Farrell, Connor Paolo and Jessie Kamm, as Alexander prove inspirational. A host of notables, such as Anthony Hopkins, Brian Blessed, Christopher Plummer and Val Kilmer proliferate the historical saga with Angelina Jolie and Francisco Bosch whose handsome features adds legendary beauty to the masterpiece. Opting not to incur the wrath of Christian Hollywood, Stone allows ancient Hellenic boys who wrestled in the nude to wear loin cloths in the Greek gym and plays down the homosexual angle between Alexander and Hephaiston, for the romantic adore and a single kiss with the Persian Boy, Bagoas. A scene which got the film banned, in of all places, Greece.

Reviewers and critics made it seem as though this movie had the plaque. I must admit Oliver Stone did not sugar-coat the story or makes Alexander too heroic. Believe me; you may never see a major motion picture that tells the story like it is like this again. Oliver Stone took a different approach with this historic figure and he really didn't capture the real spirit of Alexander the Great the way it was written in history books.Anthony Hopkin's as Ptolemy is one of his weakest and least interesting roles he's ever played and would have been better left out of the movie. I think the film would have been better had Stone told Alexander's life straight out, ditching the narrator and focusing on the life of an amazing warrior. Stone leads the viewer to believe that Alexander, though married three times, also enjoyed the (sexual) company of men----Hephaestion, his long time best friend (played by Jared Leto) and Bagoas, a Persian eunuch. The scenes are vague and leave a great deal to the viewer's imagination. If he was going to include this point of view about Alexander's life, he should have not been afraid to explore these relationships. The sexual tension between Alexander and Hephaestion was much more interesting than the relationship between Alexander and his first wife, Roxane (played by Rosario Dawson). Their violent first night of love making was unbelievable and completely void of any chemistry. As for Colin Farrell I thought he did fairly well with the poorly directed role he was given. By far, the most interesting was Angelina Jolie's (minus the accent) scheming Olympias, a woman determined to see her son become king, at any cost.It's obvious much of the film's budget went into the sets, costumes, and their authenticity which was great. I wouldn't mind viewing the uncut version to this. My theory is that people should not be reprimanded for telling a true story in its raw form. Oliver Stone and Mel Gibson are among those people. I don't recommend it to everyone, but if what I've written above strikes a chord with you, or you truly love history and would like see what the world circa 326 BC might have looked like don't pass on Alexander. It might not be `Alexander the Great,' but it truly is Alexander the Colossus.

910271,A1IBSQQHGCDUAN,B0009PLLN6,"Jeremy Ulrey ""Bangyrmfhead""","[2, 5]","While I'm not joining the ranks of those who are jumping on Oliver Stone's ass as a has-been, ""Alexander"" is not a very good argument to the contrary.  The last really good movie I saw from Stone was probably ""U-Turn"", a great little sleeper if there ever was one.  ""Any Given Sunday"" had it's moments but tried way too hard to live up to the lifestyle insanity perpetrated by lesser gridiron flicks like ""The Program"" and ""Varsity Blues"".  ""Alexander"" is as tragically flawed as it's title character, a horrendous series of missteps that overlap so often that, for reviewing purposes, it's difficult to keep track of them all.I hate to be a Colin-basher, but like many I also didn't feel Farrell was convincing as the greatest conqueror the world had ever seen.  Sure, he pulled off impetuous, daring, and (dare I say it?) even gay with aplomb, but I believe the problem lies in the script.  Even Anthony Hopkins came off as a little hokey, but given the dialogue what can you expect?  Perhaps the worst was Angelina Jolie, a vaguely incestuous background presence for Alexander throughout the movie.  I really can't emphasize how badly the dialogue helped to tank the movie.  It veers wildly from hackneyed ""Ye gods why hast thou forsaken me?"" platitudes to sheerly incomprehensible wannabe Homeric/Shakespearean ranting.  You can certainly tell what it is that they're trying to get across but you can't make yourself believe that even a people in a completely different world than ours would talk to each other in this manner.  However, the dialogue is only part of the problem, and I think if we compare ""Alexander"" to Stone's other historical dramas we can get a little closer to the root of the problem.Regardless of the amount of conjecture involved in bringing the stories of both JFK and Richard Nixon to the screen, both of those movies worked for a reason:  an unflagging attention to detail.  The reason most Hollywood biopics feel formulaic (even the beloved ""Ray"" is largely guilty of this) is because the life of a man is complex and not always rational; some of the more jagged edges are often sanded down to make it less confusing for the average viewer.  However, in doing so you run the risk of making your movie seem less like watching someone's life play out on the screen and more like a typical Hollywood melodrama.  If ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" are guilty of all manner of sins under the sun they are certainly not guilty of being ""Hollywood"".  These films worked because Oliver Stone took his time to really get inside the heads of these men and tell their tales, regardless of how many scenes or how much screen time it took to do so.But there's one big difference between those films and ""Alexander"": budget.  Yet the reason such an extravagant budget is required for this film but not the others is that neither JFK nor Nixon required huge action set pieces to tell their story.  For Alexander there is no other way.  From the age when most of us are having our first (legal) beer, Al was on the battlefield, carving his empire into the history books.  We also have another problem here:  the passage of time.  JFK and Nixon were both products of the 60s, and there is a wealth of detailed writing available on the intimacies of their psyches.  With Alexander we still have a great deal of chronicling of his exploits, but what we have mostly pertains to his military and political exploits, which leaves the mind of the man open to interpretation (ie. we know that up until the time of Philip's death Alexander was tutored by Aristotle - as famed a philosopher as ever Alexander would be a conqueror - but as to the substance of those teachings history is at a complete loss).  So it's just possible that Oliver Stone's strengths lay in other areas than psychoanalysis.  You can certainly tell a story without having any real insight into the human mind - pick up any mass market paperback for proof of that - and you can also film a pretty spiffy movie without being able to tell a story.

910287,A1HS4595P8TLG8,B0009PLLN6,JPS,"[4, 4]","I love films based on history and historical characters. I've seen this one time and time again and I still have the same mixed feelings as the very first time when I saw it on screen.Part of my problems have to do with Colin Farrell who either was miscast as Alexander or was required to play a ""human"" version of Alexander and comes out like a bit of a whimp, at least at times. Now if there is one thing that Alexander could NOT afford to be, it is precisely that, especially among his fellow-Macedonians. A Macedonian king did not live for very long if he wasn't tough, strong and ruthless. Philip was and so was Alexander, although this is not shown by Colin Farrell who, when he gets angry, seems to become more hysterical than anything else. This, in my view, was much more of a problem than deciding whether Farrell's Irish accent was ""acceptable"" or not. Anyway, they are all speaking English, not Ancient Greek or Macedonian!A related problem is the way the relationship with Hephastion is treated. No problem with the relationship per se: it certainly has to be treated because it was crucial in Alaxander's existence. I did however have a bit of problem with the way it was treated, with Hephastion ""doe eyes"" at Alexander and with the two ""boys"" falling into each other's arms and crying on each other's shoulders at the slightest provocation. Since they were both athletes, both fully mature and both seasoned killers (as all of the Macedonians were), this did not sound very realistic.On the other hand, most of the other actors (Val Kilmer as Philip, Angelina Jolie as Olympias, Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy, in particular) are good or even excellent, and so are the actors playing a number of the secondary characters such as Parmenion or Philotas. The costumes are meticulously researched and superb. The battles scenes, and Gaugamela in particular, are quite fantastic. It is however both strange and a pity that we only get treated to the two last ones - Gaugamela and Hydaspes. How about Granicus and Issos? And how about Cheronea, with Philip against Athens and Thebes? And how about all the sieges, in particular that of Tyre which lasted 7 months and was so difficult? Rather than the story of Alaxander's great deeds and those of his Macedonians, we only get a selection with many events being entirely passed over and some inacuracies introduced. For instance, Kleitos saved Alexander's life by cutting of a Persian's arm at Granicus, not at Gaugamela. Kleitos was the commander of Alexander's Royal squadrom (the king's horseguard, in effect) until he was murdered by Alexander, and he had this command already under Philip.In the film, Oliver Stone also skirts and dances around two issues which had been raised: -- First, did Alexander have a hand in his father death? He does not say so, although he seems to suspect something, given his behavior, and Stone seems to have blamed the conspiracy Olympias only. Historians and novellists have picked different interpretations, depending on how they view Alexander and we will probably nver know for sure- Second, was Alexander poisoned? Oliver Stone does not believe this was the case although the boss was clearly getting more erratic and murderous so that they could have been incentives to do away with him as a preventive measure.So, the treatment of Alexander is largely the modern view adopted by historians: an emphasis on the man rather than the conqueror or the legend. The problem is that, when it comes down to the execution, the ""human touch"" seems overplayed and Colin Farrell made a very poor and unconvincing Alexander in my view...Anyway, I loved that film, but largely because of Colin Farrell's performance and because it only tells part of the story with huge chunks left out, I can only give it three stars...",3,Too much or too little?,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,3804,"['love', 'films', 'based', 'history', 'historical', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'saw', 'screen.Part', 'problems', 'have', 'do', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'was', 'miscast', 'Alexander', 'was', 'required', 'play', 'human', 'version', 'Alexander', 'out', 'bit', 'whimp', 'least', 'times', 'Now', 'one', 'thing', 'Alexander', 'could', 'NOT', 'afford', 'be', 'precisely', 'especially', 'fellow-Macedonians', 'Macedonian', 'king', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'very', 'long', 'was', ""n't"", 'tough', 'strong', 'ruthless', 'Philip', 'was', 'so', 'was', 'Alexander', 'not', 'shown', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'when', 'angry', 'become', 'more', 'hysterical', 'anything', 'else', 'view', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'problem', 'deciding', 'Farrell', 'Irish', 'accent', 'was', 'acceptable', 'not', 'Anyway', 'are', 'speaking', 'English', 'not', 'Ancient', 'Greek', 'Macedonian', 'related', 'problem', 'way', 'relationship', 'Hephastion', 'treated', 'problem', 'relationship', 'se', 'certainly', 'be', 'treated', 'was', 'crucial', 'Alaxander', 'existence', 'did', 'however', 'have', 'bit', 'problem', 'way', 'was', 'treated', 'Hephastion', 'doe', 'eyes', 'Alexander', 'two', 'boys', 'falling', 'other', 'arms', 'crying', 'other', 'shoulders', 'slightest', 'provocation', 'were', 'athletes', 'fully', 'mature', 'seasoned', 'killers', 'Macedonians', 'were', 'did', 'not', 'sound', 'very', 'realistic.On', 'other', 'hand', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Philip', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Olympias', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ptolemy', 'particular', 'are', 'good', 'even', 'excellent', 'so', 'are', 'actors', 'playing', 'number', 'secondary', 'characters', 'such', 'Parmenion', 'Philotas', 'costumes', 'are', 'meticulously', 'researched', 'superb', 'battles', 'scenes', 'Gaugamela', 'particular', 'are', 'quite', 'fantastic', 'however', 'strange', 'pity', 'only', 'get', 'treated', 'two', 'last', 'ones', 'Gaugamela', 'Hydaspes', 'How', 'Granicus', 'Issos', 'how', 'about', 'Cheronea', 'Philip', 'Athens', 'Thebes', 'how', 'sieges', 'particular', 'Tyre', 'lasted', '7', 'months', 'was', 'so', 'difficult', 'Rather', 'story', 'Alaxander', 'great', 'deeds', 'Macedonians', 'only', 'get', 'selection', 'many', 'events', 'being', 'entirely', 'passed', 'inacuracies', 'introduced', 'instance', 'Kleitos', 'saved', 'Alexander', 'life', 'cutting', 'Persian', 'arm', 'Granicus', 'not', 'Gaugamela', 'Kleitos', 'was', 'commander', 'Alexander', 'Royal', 'squadrom', 'king', 'horseguard', 'effect', 'was', 'murdered', 'Alexander', 'had', 'command', 'already', 'Philip.In', 'film', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'also', 'dances', 'two', 'issues', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'First', 'did', 'Alexander', 'have', 'hand', 'father', 'death', 'not', 'say', 'so', 'suspect', 'something', 'given', 'behavior', 'Stone', 'have', 'blamed', 'conspiracy', 'Olympias', 'only', 'Historians', 'novellists', 'have', 'picked', 'different', 'interpretations', 'depending', 'how', 'view', 'Alexander', 'will', 'probably', 'nver', 'know', 'sure-', 'Second', 'was', 'Alexander', 'poisoned', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'case', 'boss', 'was', 'clearly', 'getting', 'more', 'erratic', 'murderous', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'incentives', 'do', 'away', 'preventive', 'measure.So', 'treatment', 'Alexander', 'largely', 'modern', 'view', 'adopted', 'historians', 'emphasis', 'man', 'rather', 'conqueror', 'legend', 'problem', 'when', 'down', 'execution', 'human', 'touch', 'overplayed', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'made', 'very', 'poor', 'unconvincing', 'Alexander', 'view', 'Anyway', 'loved', 'film', 'largely', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'performance', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'huge', 'chunks', 'left', 'out', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'stars']",Alexander

A number of years ago I was commissioned to sculpt a head of Alexander, and felt compelled to do an indept research about the man. I found him to be a man of great depth and courage. This movie fails to represent him as either (for the most part). The boy who portrayed him as a young Alexander who tamed the wild stallion was far more convincing to me than Colin Farrell, who by the way, is one of my favorite actors. I felt he was mis-cast in this role, didn't quite know what to do with it. He came across as weak, confused and not too wise. And where was his historical lover, Hephaistion? Jared Leto's role (on the DVD anyway)was limited to a few hugs and standing around in the background. I had expected to see a very dynamic relationship  between the two men.While the costumes and sets were magnificent, and the score was hauntingly beautiful (how could it not be with Vangelis composing it?), the movie itself was disjointed...the flashbacks interrupted the flow of the storyline. It had the potential to be a great movie about a man whom history paints as one of the greatest men of all time. Of course, one must ask: Who was Alexander? For legends distort reality; but there is a tremendous amount of historical documentation about the man to give us a fairly accurate portrait of who he was and what he did. I had high hopes that this movie would be the one to really bring him to life. It utterly failed.To make things worse, this DVD presents a chopped up version of what was shown in theaters. I had also hoped the bonus materials would be more impressive, The sound on the documentaries was so bad it was difficult to understand the dialogue. All in all, it was a major letdown.

Sumaran ""Roach""","[1, 6]","come on now guys..we all saw the movie last year and we all say 2 different things ""IT SUX"" or ""ITS SO GOOD"" but to be honest its a blend of SUX and TOTAL DISASTER...u know the best thing the movie offered was the narration by Anthony HopkinsSo lets get down to the movie:Collin Farrel who is suppose to portray the most famous military leader of antiquity, did a poor job at portraying such a man.Not to mention how much homosexual interaction was between Alexander and Hephaestion.It isn't that it bothers me but when its going on throughout most of the time it feels like i paid to watch a movie where 2 men keep hugging.Now the battle scenes had to be explained by Anthony Hopkins who also played Ptolemy.It got irritating that he's talking even while they're fighting, so you're sidetracked by what's being said and what's even going on. In summary,the war scenes were not as epic as one may have thought while seeing previews of this movie.Angelina Jolie as Olympias(Alexander's mother). Now one thing the writers got right: Olympias is supposed to be a manipulative woman and selfish, though she claims it was for Alexander's good.Its'a huge set back that they have Jolie playing this character because the make up on her looked ridiculous it only made her look like she hadn't slept and didn't make her look like she was a mature,older woman.Olympias i imagine would look like a woman of power with a more provocative look that quite frankly dind't suit Jolie.Her accent was terrible and not the accent u might hear out of a Macedonian woman,more like an accent of a Russian woman (no offense to the Russians).Philip II: Philip is Alexander's father and also was king of Macedonia before his son took the throne. Val Kilmer is not convincing and his short time on the screen was spent with viewers seeing him as a womanizer and a drunkard but also a man who had much hate for his wife Olympias. They made him look so old that even Kilmer couldn't see through all that make up.Kilmer played a rather weak Philip when history shows a more strong military genius.I'm not going to say more on the other characters because it's plain to see here that the movie wasn't quite an epic as much as it was a disaster. It didn't show Alexander's greatness or his strength or his genius, though Oliver Stone caught Alexander's homosexual tendencies rather well, the movie was a blend of bad make up, bad dialogue, okay sets, and the acting was to puke for.Battle scenes i was hoping would be more ""epic"" in nature but Hollywood has never done a good job at filming such action.Even if you see the 1956 release of ""Alexander the Great"" with Richard Burton, it is still the same although with less sexual language or interaction.",2,"""Epic"" it was not",1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2722,"['come', 'now', 'guys..we', 'saw', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'say', '2', 'different', 'things', 'IT', 'SUX', 'ITS', 'SO', 'GOOD', 'be', 'honest', 'blend', 'SUX', 'TOTAL', 'DISASTER', 'u', 'know', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'offered', 'was', 'narration', 'Anthony', 'HopkinsSo', 'get', 'movie', 'Collin', 'Farrel', 'who', 'suppose', 'portray', 'most', 'famous', 'military', 'leader', 'antiquity', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'portraying', 'man.Not', 'mention', 'how', 'much', 'homosexual', 'interaction', 'was', 'Alexander', 'Hephaestion.It', ""n't"", 'when', 'going', 'most', 'time', 'i', 'paid', 'watch', 'movie', 'where', '2', 'men', 'keep', 'hugging.Now', 'battle', 'scenes', 'had', 'be', 'explained', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'Ptolemy.It', 'got', 'irritating', 'talking', 'even', ""'re"", 'fighting', ""'re"", 'sidetracked', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'what', 'even', 'going', 'summary', 'war', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'epic', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'seeing', 'previews', 'movie.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Olympias', 'Alexander', 'mother', 'Now', 'one', 'thing', 'writers', 'got', 'right', 'Olympias', 'supposed', 'be', 'manipulative', 'woman', 'selfish', 'was', 'Alexander', 'good.Its', 'huge', 'set', 'back', 'have', 'Jolie', 'playing', 'character', 'make', 'up', 'looked', 'ridiculous', 'only', 'made', 'look', 'had', ""n't"", 'slept', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'look', 'was', 'mature', 'older', 'woman.Olympias', 'i', 'imagine', 'would', 'look', 'woman', 'power', 'more', 'provocative', 'look', 'quite', 'frankly', ""dind't"", 'suit', 'Jolie.Her', 'accent', 'was', 'terrible', 'not', 'accent', 'u', 'might', 'hear', 'Macedonian', 'woman', 'more', 'accent', 'Russian', 'woman', 'offense', 'Russians', '.Philip', 'II', 'Philip', 'Alexander', 'father', 'also', 'was', 'king', 'Macedonia', 'son', 'took', 'throne', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'not', 'convincing', 'short', 'time', 'screen', 'was', 'spent', 'viewers', 'seeing', 'womanizer', 'drunkard', 'also', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'much', 'hate', 'wife', 'Olympias', 'made', 'look', 'so', 'old', 'even', 'Kilmer', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'make', 'up.Kilmer', 'played', 'rather', 'weak', 'Philip', 'when', 'history', 'more', 'strong', 'military', 'genius.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'more', 'other', 'characters', 'plain', 'see', 'here', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'epic', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'disaster', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'Alexander', 'greatness', 'strength', 'genius', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'caught', 'Alexander', 'homosexual', 'tendencies', 'rather', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'blend', 'bad', 'make', 'up', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'okay', 'sets', 'acting', 'was', 'puke', 'for.Battle', 'scenes', 'i', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'epic', 'nature', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'filming', 'such', 'action.Even', 'see', '1956', 'release', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'still', 'same', 'less', 'sexual', 'language', 'interaction']",Alexander

Teuton,"[3, 15]","After viewing this movie, one thing is for certain, the Greeks, according to Oliver Stone, were Irish, at least the ones who worshiped Dionysius.  Angelina Jolie gives a much better performance and much more convincing one, considering she does not age a single day from the birth of Alexander to his death at age 30ish.  At least her accent is decidedly from the Mediterranean.  Even Anthony Hopkins, who is such a great actor, can't seem to nail it down, his prim and proper English is just too out of place, but Colin Ferrell and the majority of the other actors have such a thick Irish accent that it detracts from what could have been a decent movie, and I mean thicker than Irish soda bread soaked in a pint of Guinness.  The movie itself is not bad, and the acting, apart from the blatant disregard for dialect, is decent, it's no where near as stiff or bad as Kevin Costner in Robin Hood, but the, damn near Gaelic, accent that Colin Ferrel and the other actors use in the movie far out-shadows, Costner's lack of a English accent in Robin Hood.  It just detracts from the movie so much it actually makes it hard to watch.  The action sequences are top notch; the cinematography is very well done, it's just those accents, they're everywhere.  I am afraid that Oliver Stone did not have any speaking roles for the Persians as they probably spoke fluent Mandarin, though they looked the part.

910292,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0009PLLN6,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 3]","Before I get into the review of ""Alexander"" I must say that I was looking forward to seeing this movie before it was released to theaters.  My thinking was it stars Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, and Angelina Jolie, plus it's directed by Oliver Stone how could this movie be bad.  Well, needless to say it managed to be not only bad, but horrendous.  After several friends of mine saw the film and hated it, their reasons were vast and shared by many, here are a few examples of their complaints; too slow, too much focus on homosexuality (Alexander the Great was believed to have been bisexual which was common among Greeks, yet this film paints him as only being gay), there's no sense of a greater destiny for the character, horrible editing and time jumps, just to name a few.  But for the DVD release Warner Brothers announced that Oliver Stone had re-edited his would-be epic film and now it is about 30 minutes shorter, much faster paced with more action, and a more balanced view of his sexuality (basically giving more screentime to Rosario Dawson as his wife, Roxanne).  So like an idiot I took the bait, and rented ""Alexander: The Director's Cut"", now since I never saw the theatrical release I can't say how much faster paced this version was, but to me the pace was excruciatingly slow and still focused too heavily on homosexuality.  But that's enough gripes for now, let's move on to the outline for the story and then I'll gripe some more at the end, but I do have a few good things to say as well for the film, so please read on.""Alexander: The Director's Cut"" follows the life and conquests of the man history has dubbed `Alexander the Great'.  Alexander was born of royal blood, his father was King Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer), a rough, womanizing, drunk of a man; and his mother was Olympia (Angelina Jolie) who many believed to be a mystic and whom herself believed to be a descendant of the gods.  With parents like these Alexander was destined to be somewhat messed up, yet he managed to overcome these two powerfully controlling forces and become one of the greatest leaders and military tacticians of all time.  After the death of King Philip, Alexander assumes the throne and sets off on a quest to conquer the known world.  From the deserts of Afghanistan and Persia to the lush forests of Asia, Alexander's ingenuity for military tactics enabled him to defeat almost any foe he encountered.Now this story sounds intriguing, but Oliver Stone manages to butcher it with terrible editing and time jumps through Alexander's life.  In one moment Alexander is a teenager, the next we're 20 years into the future and he has already conquered several countries.  Also though no sexually explicit scenes between men were shown it was heavily implied, especially between Alexander and his best friend Hephastion (Jared Leto).  This strong overtone of homosexuality wouldn't have been so distracting if it wasn't in every single scene, plus the fact that Alexander is believed to have been bisexual meaning there should have been more focus on the women of Alexander's life.  And yet another problem was that you really don't care for Alexander, in epic films like this you should care for what is going to happen to the central character, whether he lives or dies, whether he will triumph or fail.  In this movie I found myself not caring at all, I would have been fine if Alexander would have died during the first battle, at least the movie would have been over sooner.  Truthfully, the most interesting characters in the film, and the ones I wanted to know more about were Alexander's parents, King Philip and Olympia.  That alone tells you how much of a failure this film is for Oliver Stone.Many people gripe that the casting was all wrong, actually I felt the casting was great, Colin Farrell was very good as Alexander, he just didn't have much to work with, and Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie were outstanding as the controlling parents of history's greatest conqueror.  The casting was not what made this movie fail, as I have alluded to in my complaints of this movie, the biggest reason for ""Alexander"" failing at the box office and on DVD is none other than Oliver Stone himself.  Oliver Stone is known for making very complex and engaging movies, and for loving controversy which is probably why he infused so much homosexuality in this movie.  If Stone would have just gotten beyond his penchant for controversy and focused more on Alexander's conquests rather than his much debated love life, this film could have been the grand epic it aspired to be.""Alexander: The Director's Cut"" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.",2,Alexander the Boring...,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,4672,"['get', 'review', 'Alexander',

910300,A5UGX57EV695M,B0009PLLN6,Kenneth M. Pizzi,"[3, 5]","Recently, I purchased this DVD set on sale on a whim at Target because I enjoy ancient history and have seen many films that have depicted this historical period (Ancient Greece and Rome) magnificently or have failed miserably.I clearly recall the publicity blitz for this movie as well on its initial release on cable channels like American Movie Classics and E! And I also believe that noted historian, Michael Wood, ""In Search of the Trojan War"" and ""In Search of Alexander,"" was an unofficial consultant to the film. So, it should be in pretty good hands, right?  Well, not quite...On the whole, this film is cinematically opulent despite some of the rather cheap-looking sets (look closely): this basically means it is beautiful to look at. Angelina Jolie gives an understated but serviceable performance as Alexander's mother and Val Kilmer(one-eyed and stumbling about the lavish set) is credible as Phillip of Macedon. Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer (although his appearance is too brief) give this film the added gravitas it so desperately needs.The battle sequences are well-orchestrated compliments of CGI--perhaps a little too much--but this is what we have come to expect ever since Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" made it's debut. So where does the problem lie?  The casting of the lead, Colin Farrell?  Perhaps, but it really isn't appropriate to place the burden of the film's success or lack of it on his shoulders alone. The problem with this film lies, in my humble opinion, not in Oliver Stone's direction, but in the execution of Alexander's story--there is only so much life one can possibly cram into 167 minutes.  Besides, experience is an excellent teacher, and if Stone's ""JFK"" has taught us anything it's that this director takes liberties with the facts of history.For those who have studied the classics know that Alexander was an extremely complex individual--and I am not just referring his ambiguous sexual orientation that is clumsily acknowledged in this film--but his motivations, his ideals, and his psyche all need to come to play effectively in order to understand the man. The film seems rushed as if the producer and director agreed to pack everything in and as much as possible. But Stone cannot really pull it off here. Colin Farrell manages what he can with a limited script oftentimes sounding more like an LA thirty-something bellowing to his teammates during a casual weekend pick-up basketball game than ordering his cavalry to check King Darius' left flank!  Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is on my ""must buy"" list, but I have my doubts now after seeing Stone's film.In all honesty, a picture like this needs an actor of Richard Burton's stature, vocal presence, and strength to pull it off. We all know ""Cleopatra"" was a bloated melodrama, but somehow his presence made even bad films tolerable. Incidentally, the Welsh actor did play Alexander the Great in a 1960's version biopic available on MGM-DVD.If only Anthony Mann was alive today to repeat the technical and artistic success of his magnificent ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" made over 40 years ago. Nonetheless, Stone's ""Alexander"" offers an acceptable way to pass a couple of hours on an extended holiday weekend as I did.",3,There are better sword and sandal epics out there...,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,3236,"['Recently', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'set', 'sale', 'whim', 'Target', 'enjoy', 'ancient', 'history', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'depicted', 'historical', 'period', 'Ancient', 'Greece', 'Rome', 'magnificently', 'have', 'failed', 'miserably.I', 'clearly', 'recall', 'publicity', 'blitz', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'initial', 'release', 'cable', 'channels', 'American', 'Movie', 'Classics', 'E', 'also', 'believe', 'noted', 'historian', 'Michael', 'Wood', 'Search', 'Trojan', 'War', 'Search', 'Alexander', 'was', 'unofficial', 'consultant', 'film', 'So', 'should', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'hands', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'quite', 'whole', 'film', 'cinematically', 'opulent', 'rather', 'cheap-looking', 'sets', 'look', 'closely', 'basically', 'beautiful', 'look', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'understated', 'serviceable', 'performance', 'Alexander', 'mother', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'one-eyed', 'stumbling', 'lavish', 'set', 'credible', 'Phillip', 'Macedon', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'appearance', 'too', 'brief', 'give', 'film', 'added', 'gravitas', 'so', 'desperately', 'needs.The', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'well-orchestrated', 'compliments', 'CGI', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'ever', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Gladiator', 'made', 'debut', 'So', 'where', 'problem', 'lie', 'casting', 'lead', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Perhaps', 'really', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'place', 'burden', 'film', 'success', 'lack', 'shoulders', 'alone', 'problem', 'film', 'humble', 'opinion', 'not', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'direction', 'execution', 'Alexander', 'story', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'one', 'can', 'possibly', 'cram', '167', 'minutes', 'experience', 'excellent', 'teacher', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'taught', 'anything', 'director', 'liberties', 'facts', 'history.For', 'who', 'have', 'studied', 'classics', 'know', 'Alexander', 'was', 'extremely', 'complex', 'individual', 'am', 'not', 'just', 'referring', 'ambiguous', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'clumsily', 'acknowledged', 'film', 'motivations', 'ideals', 'psyche', 'need', 'come', 'play', 'effectively', 'order', 'understand', 'man', 'film', 'rushed', 'producer', 'director', 'agreed', 'pack', 'everything', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'Stone', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'pull', 'off', 'here', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'what', 'can', 'limited', 'script', 'oftentimes', 'sounding', 'more', 'LA', 'thirty-something', 'bellowing', 'teammates', 'casual', 'weekend', 'pick-up', 'basketball', 'game', 'ordering', 'cavalry', 'check', 'King', 'Darius', 'left', 'flank', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'must', 'buy', 'list', 'have', 'doubts', 'now', 'seeing', 'Stone', 'film.In', 'honesty', 'picture', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'stature', 'vocal', 'presence', 'strength', 'pull', 'off', 'know', 'Cleopatra', 'was', 'bloated', 'melodrama', 'somehow', 'presence', 'made', 'even', 'bad', 'films', 'tolerable', 'Incidentally', 'Welsh', 'actor', 'did', 'play', 'Alexander', 'Great', '1960', 'version', 'biopic', 'available', 'MGM-DVD.If', 'only', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'was', 'alive', 'today', 'repeat', 'technical', 'artistic', 'success', 'magnificent', 'Fall', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'made', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'Nonetheless', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'acceptable', 'way', 'pass', 'couple', 'hours', 'extended', 'holiday', 'weekend', 'did']",Alexander

First released in 2004, the movie was a major flop and generally scorned by viewers and critics alike. After offering the Director's Cut on DVD, Stone returned to the movie to offer this final version that plays for three and a half hours. Besides additional footage, Stone changes the narrative structure, relying more on flashbacks to tell the story.This ""Final Cut"" certainly is better than the first two versions of the film. Colin Farrell does a fine job in the lead role and there are some excellent, if gory, battle scenes. Rosario Dawson's role as Alexander's wife Roxana is expanded. Stone includes more on Alexander's turbulent relationship with his closest generals and his romantic relationships with two other men. The score by Vangelis is excellent. A number of actors--Brian Blessed, Anthony Hopkins, Christopher Plummer--make appearances that are a little too brief.Still, there are flaws. Stone is less than subtle about trying to show how his conflicting parents shaped Alexander. Val Kilmer's take on Philip of Macedon needed a bit more time on the screen to really be fleshed out. Angelina Jolie hams it up as Alexander's mother Olympia. Besides lacking subtlety in the role, the accent Jolie uses it so horrible that it undermines her performance. Considering this is the third cut, Stone could have added special features. The only one is Stone offering his thoughts on why this ""Final Cut"" was needed, the artistic freedom it presented him and a charming comparison to the epics of the 50s and 60s that he loved so much.Even in this final form, ""Alexander"" is not a great movie.

910305,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009PLLN6,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 11]","Myths often find their origin in the truth.  The truth, however, as it is remembered sometimes bends and changes between translations, fading memories, and subjective reasoning.  Thus, the truth gives birth to a myth while myths generate their own life in the mouth of storytellers and scholars whose wisdom and knowledge goes unquestioned.  Oliver Stone tells his vision of the greatest human myth of all time - the life of Alexander the Great.Alexander depicts the tale of the Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great, from childhood until his death at the age of 32.  It should be known that contemporary studies on Alexander the Great often focus on his persona and what made him so great.  Unfortunately, no unbiased material exists in regards to Alexander's character, which has forced historians to deduct information through the recorded events and the limited amount of existing writing concerning Alexander.  It has left him with portrayals such as an evil tyrant to a kind and valiant leader.  The interpretation of Alexander's persona is open to examination, but true image of his character will never be known.  Nonetheless, scholars continue to hypothesize and make calculated guesses as to what made him so great.  Oliver Stone offers his interpretation in Alexander.A fragmented storyline opens with Alexander raising his hand with a ring of some significance while laying on his deathbed.  An old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) reveals this is Alexandria 40 years after Alexander's death while reciting his past to a scribe.  It is a rather idealistic prologue that talks about Alexander's feats and achievements by setting sight on Babylon and the land beyond.  There are several visual insertions of mosaics and wall paintings to support Ptolemy's reasoning, which smoothly transition to Alexander's youth.The disjointed storyline moves back and forth between Alexander's early days and his conquest of the east.  The flashbacks help understand how Alexander became who he turned out to be.  This of course is a subjective interpretation, as so many other interpretations that exist.  The cinematic version by Stone might be different than most desire.  Nonetheless, it is of no-less value than other interpretations.Alexander in Stone's interpretation seems to have been heavily influenced by his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), who constantly told him that he was a son of the god Zeus.  It is also apparent that Alexander's father, King Philip (Val Kilmer), influenced him, but much more infrequent than his mother.  There is also a heavy dose of how his education and friendships steered him in the direction of greatness.  These are facets that are essential in any human beings existence, and Alexander was not above it.  This helps paint a more real image than the mythical and mysterious persona that exists around Alexander the Great.When Alexander (Collin Ferrell) stands outnumbered by one to six in front of the Persian army he begins his conquest of the east, as they know it.  This becomes the beginning of a life-long test where Alexander finds himself to have to utilize all his wisdom and knowledge.  The value of an education and sources of influence emerge in the film, as Alexander questions what has been taught when he steps beyond the known world.  It is also evident that the many mosaics and wall paintings in the film are relevant to the story, as Stone frequently returns to them as teachers would use learning tools in a classroom.  Slowly the audience gets to see how this historical person was shaped in Stone's interpretation.It is an epic journey that Alexander undertakes and he is about to learn about group dynamics and the desires of others for wealth and power.  In a sense, the notions presented by Stone are very applicable in the modern world where xenophobia, homophobia, and expansionism exist.  This might seem a little too obvious of a contemporary societal critique, but the question remains for the audience to answer while viewing the film.Some film critics have noted that war sequences are repetitively bloody, but then again is war not bloody and repetitive in the sense of killing?  In addition, the battle scenes create a sense of meaninglessness; as in retrospect humanity knows of the fabled glory of war created by kings and leaders to gain the masses approval and willingness to fight until the death.  Through these scenes, the audience does experience some of Alexander's greatness in regards to warfare, but also see the bloody aftermath.The film, unfortunately, suffers from some larger-than-life acting, which maybe tries to develop a sense that the Greek gods might have been conversing.  Perhaps it is a result of the big Greek forums and the learning of how to speak in public, or it might be an attempt to create an atmosphere of greatness.  Whatever the reason, it feels awkward and it cannot be neglected, as the story tries to deal with more psychological and social issues.  Despite what could be called intentionally overacting, Stone succeeds in capturing a stunning environment for almost all scenes through a terrific cinematography, which elevates the cinematic experience.Stone like so many other storytellers before him has told his version of the truth and sometimes bent the truth to keep the audience's attention, or to create a reaction.  In either case, it seems like Stone has added more to the myths around the historical person that also was the first to be named the Great.  It leaves the audience with a film that the viewer wants to like, but it does not really achieve the greatness it intended to.",4,Intriguing Interpretation of Historical Greatness...,1123027200,"08 3,

910306,A14OC67MXL92FA,B0009PLLN6,"Kindle Customer ""soul_survivor""","[11, 12]","This third video release of Oliver Stone's epic about Alexander the Great not only adds 40 minutes of new footage but radically restructures the film.  There is a lot more jumping back and forth in time, tied together by Anthony Hopkins's narration.  The two big battle scenes have been moved close to the beginning and the ending, bookending the rest of the picture.  To some extent, this revision of the narrative improves the picture, but ultimately, this is still a coffee table movie.Watching Alexander on Blu-Ray is nothing short of breathtaking.  It's stunning how much effort went into the set decoration, makeup, costumes, and overall production design, and all of that work makes for a visual feast in high-definition.  The scene of Alexander entering Babylon, for example, bursts off the screen with vivid, crisp colors, creating a genuine sense of another time and place.  Photography is spectacular throughout, from the battle scenes to sweeping mountain and jungle shots.None of this makes up for the muddled script and incoherent characterizations that hobble the picture.  One long rambling scene after another features Colin Farrell as Alexander speechifying to swelling music.  Farrell seems to be shouting, screaming, or crying in almost every scene, a poster child for scenery-chewing.  No doubt this is what Oliver Stone asked him to do, but he lacks a certain three-dimensional quality.  We never understand much about Alexander and his motivations.  Jared Leto, as Alexander's closest friend Hephaiston, is a much stronger screen presence; even Anthony Hopkins's narration is more involving.At 214 minutes, this requires some patience to get through, although it's never exactly boring, just slow-moving.  If you didn't like the theatrical release or the slightly shorter Director's Cut, it's unlikely you'll like this new version more.  If you were a fan of the original, however, this is worth a look, especially if you can see it in high definition.

910308,AGKJF15QQNVX6,B0009PLLN6,"klownboy ""klownboy""","[3, 8]","The only version of this movie I have seen is the Director's cut on DVD.What a ham-handed mess.  Stone gets big-dollar backing to produce a film about the most successful military commander/ruler in history.  He can hunt and peck through 33 years of intrigue, strategy, and history and assemble, write, and tell any story he wants.  Wow what an opportunity.  How are you gonna handle this Oliver?  Not very well.Maybe the scope of Alexander's life and achievements is simply too overwhelming, and I could see where in the right hands, this project might have come off better if it was a multi part epic - Young Alexander to the conquest of Babylon, then another film following his endless campaigning in Asia to his early demise.  But even so, others have done a better job of making a completely fictional fantasy world more meaningful than Stone's take on this slice of real history.Stone opts for a teetering, drawn-out, fictionalized character study with no bite, no warmth, and no identifiable center.  He blows off all the military stuff (and a lot of it is very significant) except for two battles, and manages to make those two completely unfollowable.  He drags us through conversations, using 18 lines of dialogue when 2 would've sufficed.  OK, Alexander is motivated by his identification with the Greek Myths.  We get it, but 5 minutes later we are still droning on with Christopher Plummer, and later we cover the same territory with Kilmer, again.  Heck, even Batman Begins did better with this type of scene, presenting it as a montage with a sense of time and evolution, rather than an afternoon of endless whiney interrogation, with a repeat.  The same tack is taken with his conversations with his mother - 30 seconds of hackneyed dialogue repeatedly crammed into 5 minutes.  Stone may have ""toned down"" the homosexuality for this release, but it's hardly apparent.  We even get a shadowy shot of Farrell's corn-hole, taint, and junk; I guess because it's so ""important"" to the story.  Val Kilmer delivers his lines like a disappointed mill worker instead of a king, and walks around in the background to sledgehammer in the point that Alexander sometimes thinks about his father.  Oh!, and flashbacks, lots and lots of flashbacks (apparently even more than the original).  And just for fun, let's give Alexander, old AND young, Irish accents, and have Jolie imitate Christianne Amanpour.  Even the technical aspects are fairly dull.  Some tame, drowsy, uninspired location shooting, and some CGI action that clouds the battles, rather than bringing them to life.  We even get a hackneyed red tint in one scene that highlights Stone's complete lack of creativity.At some point I just started laughing at it.  It's a $150,000,000.00 bad Mexican Soap Opera, with an occasional Ron Burgundy-ish ""..by Zeus' Beard!"" thrown in.  But it's just too long and numbing to succeed as repeat viewable campy fun.With all of its flaws, it does teach one of history's most important lessons:  Don't ever let Oliver Stone do a movie about you.",2,"You mean there's a longer, gayer version.....",1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,3045,"['only', 'version', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Director', 'cut', 'DVD.What', 'ham-handed', 'mess', 'Stone', 'big-dollar', 'backing', 'produce', 'film', 'most', 'successful', 'military', 'commander/ruler', 'history', 'can', 'hunt', 'peck', '33', 'years', 'intrigue', 'strategy', 'history', 'assemble', 'write', 'tell', 'story', 'Wow', 'what', 'opportunity', 'How', 'are', 'gon', 'handle', 'Oliver', 'Not', 'very', 'well.Maybe', 'scope', 'Alexander', 'life', 'achievements', 'simply', 'too', 'overwhelming', 'could', 'see', 'where', 'right', 'hands', 'project', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'better', 'was', 'multi', 'part', 'epic', 'Young', 'Alexander', 'conquest', 'Babylon', 'then', 'film', 'following', 'endless', 'campaigning', 'Asia', 'early', 'demise', 'even', 'so', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'making', 'completely', 'fictional', 'fantasy', 'world', 'more', 'meaningful', 'Stone', 'take', 'slice', 'real', 'history.Stone', 'opts', 'teetering', 'drawn-out', 'fictionalized', 'character', 'study', 'bite', 'warmth', 'identifiable', 'center', 'military', 'stuff', 'lot', 'very', 'significant', 'two', 'battles', 'make', 'two', 'completely', 'unfollowable', 'conversations', 'using', '18', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'when', '2', 'would', ""'ve"", 'sufficed', 'OK', 'Alexander', 'motivated', 'identification', 'Greek', 'Myths', 'get', '5', 'minutes', 'later', 'are', 'still', 'droning', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'later', 'cover', 'same', 'territory', 'Kilmer', 'again', 'Heck', 'even', 'Batman', 'did', 'better', 'type', 'scene', 'presenting', 'montage', 'sense', 'time', 'evolution', 'rather', 'afternoon', 'endless', 'whiney', 'interrogation', 'repeat', 'same', 'tack', 'taken', 'conversations', 'mother', '30', 'seconds', 'hackneyed', 'dialogue', 'repeatedly', 'crammed', '5', 'minutes', 'Stone', 'may', 'have', 'toned', 'down', 'homosexuality', 'release', 'hardly', 'apparent', 'even', 'get', 'shadowy', 'shot', 'Farrell', 'corn-hole', 'taint', 'junk', 'guess', 'so', 'important', 'story', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'lines', 'disappointed', 'mill', 'worker', 'instead', 'king', 'walks', 'background', 'sledgehammer', 'point', 'Alexander', 'sometimes', 'father', 'Oh', 'flashbacks', 'lots', 'lots', 'flashbacks', 'apparently', 'even', 'more', 'original', 'just', 'fun', 'let', 'give', 'Alexander', 'old', 'AND', 'young', 'Irish', 'accents', 'have', 'Jolie', 'imitate', 'Christianne', 'Amanpour', 'Even', 'technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'fairly', 'dull', 'tame', 'drowsy', 'uninspired', 'location', 'shooting', 'CGI', 'action', 'battles', 'rather', 'bringing', 'life', 'even', 'get', 'hackneyed', 'red', 'tint', 'one', 'scene', 'Stone', 'complete', 'lack', 'creativity.At', 'point', 'just', 'started', 'laughing', '150,000,000.00', 'bad', 'Mexican', 'Soap', 'Opera', 'occasional', 'Ron', 'Burgundy-ish', '..by', 'Zeus', 'Beard', 'thrown', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'numbing', 'succeed', 'repeat', 'viewable', 'campy', 'fun.With', 'flaws', 'teach', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'important', 'lessons', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'let', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'do', 'movie']",Alexander

910310,A2ZFAYA9NKP2SA,B0009PLLN6,LadyArmand,"[12, 14]","The Directors Cut...I did something rather unfortunate I actually watched the directors cut of Alexander.  The truth of the matter is I didn't find the theatrical version of the movie nearly as bad as some the reviewers here at Amazon nor the critics who get paid to trash other people's hard work.I gave/give Oliver Stone credit for trying to bring to the screen the life of someone who accomplished more in his 32/33 years of life than most people do if they live to be 80.  Here was a man who held together an army of well over a hundred thousand men, and this isn't counting their wives, mistresses, children, slaves, craftsmen, merchants, and traders.  Alexander's was a mobile city, a mobile kingdom led by the center, kept together by the center, and destroyed when the center died.  Here was a man who fought at the head of his army, not asking his men to do anything he himself would refuse to do.  He was wounded by every conceivable weapon of the day. All of this he did without losing a battle. This is a man who was a strategic genius whose exploits and concept of universality paved the way for Christianity, a universal language and a universal monetary code.  Generals today still study his military tactics and implement them in some form or fashion.  And these are people who because of Alexander's sexual proclivities wouldn't even allow him to enter the armed forces today.In the theatrical release of this film Oliver tried to convey Alexander's strengths and weaknesses as a man and as a leader while at the same time illustrating his vast and ultimately unattainable dream of inclusion. (Yes he wanted to conquer but he also respected those he conquered; he allowed them to keep their own traditions and religion.  He even adapted some of their customs in order to show his good faith. ) Did Oliver Stone's reach exceed his grasp?  Sure it did. But considering the subject matter I dare say anyone taking on the daunting task of retelling one of the greatest stories ever told about one of the greatest lives ever lived would have had a difficult time pulling it off.Where I fault Mr. Stone is his attempt to appease those narrow minded bigots who will never accept that Alexander not only had three wives but a eunuch lover Bagoas and a male lover of nearly nineteen years in his general Hephaestion.  With this new cut of the film one is hard pressed to understand the significance of Hephaestion in the grand scheme of things making Alexander's reaction to his death near the end impossible to understand.  The voice over of Ptolemy says that Alexander follows Hephaestion down to the house of death as he promised.  And yet in this new cut of the film you don't see that promise, therefore for the audience there is no contextual reference for Ptolemy's comment.There are several such moments in this new cut of the film.  Things that seems to come out of nowhere and it is only when you watch the film with the commentary that you somewhat understand what Oliver was thinking when he pieced it together in this way.  And even then one is left scratching their heads in wonderment as to why he felt to need to cave into the studio and other outside forces that wanted a more sanitized version of the film.  It appeared from the film Alexander would and should have been more upset had Bagoas or Roxanne had died.If you want to see this movie, I suggest you buy the theatrical version and not waste your time and energy trying to decipher this mess.Theatrical Release.....I did a review for the directors cut, so I thought it only fair that I do one for the theatrical release......Oliver Stone gets a big round of applause from me on the theatrical release of this film.  He took on a huge project which had only been done once before with the 1950 release of Alexander the Great starring Richard Burton as Alexander. So there's a 54 year gap where Hollywood wouldn't or couldn't tackle the subject matter again for the big screen.Unlike the more profitable Troy, Alexander doesn't shy away from what Oliver Stone calls Alexander's pan-sexuality. In that he had sexual relationships with women, men and eunuchs. This wasn't shown gratuitously or graphically, but simply as a part of who he was.  Trying as the whole film does to present us with a fuller picture of the man, and not just his deeds which are monumental. This unfortunately to some fans and critics alike seemed to have been a mistake, and some so called educated people couldn't get past that in their critiques of the film; which is unfortunate because it vividly illustrates that we're not as progressive as a society as we would like to think we are or in fact claim we are. It would seem in this instance we could learn a huge lesson from the ancient Greeks and their acceptance of the human body as well as sexuality; considering they didn't have a term for heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual.  Labels weren't necessary achievement and integrity where what counted in the end.  We seem to have lost that somewhere along the way, by making one's sexual orientation speak more to character than actual deeds, motivations, and integrity.To me more than anything in this film Oliver tried to make Alexander more human, which by extension makes him more accessible to the audience. By showing the audience the power struggle going on between his father Philip and his mother Olympias we're given insight into not only some of Alexander's personal drive; but what he rose above and in some cases what led to his downfall.That being said there were some flaws in the film which is to be expected considering the vastness of the story and the scope of the life trying to be captured in what comparatively is a small medium with limitations considering the subject matter hence the 54 year gap between attempts being made to deliver this story to the screen.The DVD contains some interesting documentaries as well as commentary by Oliver Stone himself and Robin Lane Fox who wrote the book Alexander the Great, and was the historical consultant on the film. The extras give great insight into the motivation behind certain aspects involved not only in developing this film from concept to actuality, but gives the audience insight into the process of making a film with huge potential and a great amount of pressure because of that potential.No one can tell you what your tastes are going to dictate to you.  Not a review or even a slew of them can do that.  What I will say is this.  If you are in the least bit interested in the life of Alexander the Great then watching this film will feed into that interest and might inspire you to look further into his life on your own.  If for whatever reason any hint of homosexuality, bisexuality, or anything you consider an alternative lifestyle bother you, then I suggest that you run as far and as fast as you can from this film because it's going to bother you.  But if you have an open mind and would like to get a glimpse even a flawed one into the life of a man who by the age of 25 conquered the known world then buy the theatrical edition of this film.  It's by no means the greatest film ever made, but its ambition and audacity made it for worth watching for me....",2,What the......,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,7211,"['Directors', 'Cut', 'did',

And one of them, very dry and as yet unimmersed, goes up to Mom and says, ""Mom, how do I dive into the water?"" And she says 'honey, you have to get wet first. Go on. Jump in the pool.'OK. Granted it's kind of a stretch but stay with me. Alexander's bisexualty. Oliver. Do it or don't. Pained stares, lots of mascara and 12-step hugs don't do it. It's almost 2006.Stone does great work and like successful directors in a whimsical industry, success is sometimed marred by failure. Or worse, mediocrity. Wall Street, Platoon, 4th of July, Nixon, are juxtaposed against JFK and Heaven and Earth. And one thing's for certain. Alexander ain't great and it might be in the latter category. It seems there might have been some areas that could have been avoided.You know I don't think the bisexualty issue is a big deal but you have to admit, it's a hot topic. It's kind of like gay marriages in the last election. It's bound to attract a stream of negativity. It's a lightening rod. I believe that from an accuracy point of view, it's really hard to say what a person's sexualty is now, much less 2000 years ago. Hell. We don't even know what Bubba's sexuality was. How are we supposed to know Alexander's?And then there's that 'one foot in the water one foot out' approach. Come on Oliver. You're the Director. Make a decision.The scenes tainted in red. The Val Kilmer trip to the blood cave. These are things right out of the 60's. It reminded me of Peter Fonda as Captain America in the cemetery scene. Yeah. You know what I'm talking about.And the dialogue. I couldn't understand 1/2 of it because of the background noise. And I just think these were vicious, pagan times when a whole lot of brain-picking and dialoguing and networking just didn't go on.And the 'lets treat our enemies like our friends and return them to positions of power 'cause we're all equals under the same God . . . or multiple Gods.' Man that didn't happen after WWII and I'm pretty certain it didn't happen after the Macedonians sacked Persia and everything else in their path.One last point. The speeches. If you think that Alexander gave speeches on Honor and Loyalty and a Tranquil Homelife and Glory and Equality to 100,000 men, you deserve this movie.Jolie is great as Olympias although, didn't you think Alexander's mother should have been a little less hot and older? Colin Farrell, good actor, great hair. Not in the Heston, Burton, Douglas (Kirk. Please), Crowe mold.Damn tedious. You want something good? Read Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire.""

910313,A1VLCEVT52XENT,B0009PLLN6,Laura,"[4, 8]","After watching this long boring film, I could not help thinking just why Oliver Stone made this film in this aful fashion.  Whenever exciting parts came up in the film, it only lasted for very short time, and all the boring parts in this movie lasted a whole lot longer.  Some parts of the movie was shown for very long time, and other parts were just shown very quickly.  This film needed to be evened out.  For example, Alexander's first whife dance scene was shown for quite a long time.  Then, I had to set through lot of the boring mumble jumble after that.  Then, the movie showed male dancers dancing, and I thought finally something exotic and fun thing to watch, but then this portion of the film only lasted for 5 seconds!  In the commentary section, Oliver Stone said that he did not wished to spend too much time showing this male dancing portion of the film, because he felt it was not about the dancing at all.  I could not believe that Oliver Stone said this.  This portion was one of the more exciting parts of the movie to watch, and if he would have made this portion longer, we might have seen some wonderful and exotic dance moves.  After watching this whole film, I could not help but felt disappointed, and not just because I felt I got short changed on the dance section, but short changed on all the exciting parts int this whole movie.

910314,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009PLLN6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","I thought Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" went off the tracks when we suddenly cut from Alexander (Collin Farrell) as a young man butting heads with his father, King Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer), to Alexander as King about to fight the army of the Persian ruler Darius at the Battle of Issus.  I thought this was because since Alexander has the known world to conquerer in the 2 hours and 55 minutes of the director's cut that Stone was simply moving on to the good stuff.  But instead of simply doing a cinematic tour of the highlights of the life of Alexander the Great, Stone develops parallel stories.  In the ""present"" we have Alexander conquering the world while trying to juggle his relationships with Roxanne (Rosario Dawson), the woman he chooses to marry, and his particular friend Hephaistion (Jared Leto), while in the past Alexander has to grow up with a dominating mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie) and a disinterested father.  Actually, his mother insists he is the son of Zeus and not Philip, which explains why the king has picked a new queen and ignores Alexander.Stone's purpose clearly seems to be that he wants to explore ""why"" Alexander did what he did.  The problem is that the film suggests it has something to do with his relationship with his parents, but how their treatment of him resulted in a young man audacious and brilliant enough to conquer the world is not clear.  The pivotal scene in the film becomes when Alexander insists that he can ride the great horse Bucephalus.  The young Alexander succeeds, just as the older one would conquer the world, but the reason for both remains what it was before the film started.  Alexander succeeds because he is Alexander the Great.  The movie is not advancing our understanding of the man the way that it should.  His parents seem to be teaching him valuable lessons only by negation and if Olympias insists Alexander is not the son of Philip, then Philip is even more blind than he usually is if he does not see that Alexander is not like his mother either.  The success of ""Alexander"" rests entirely on its ability to explain his motivation, and only in too brief scenes involving Aristotle (Christopher Plummer), does it get close to the start of something that makes sense to me in that regard.""How"" Alexander conquered the world is left mostly to the voice over narration of Old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins), now the Egyptian Pharaoh, with the exception of film's two battle sequences, the Battle of Issus and the Battle of the Hydaspes River in India.  These two battles represent his greatest victory and greatest, or at least final, defeat.  From a tactical standpoint the latter is the more interesting battle (especially all of the feints and psychological tactics Alexander employed before hand), but Stone only seeks to explain the former.  However, this is problematic because the battle was being fought on a desert plain devoid of physical detail, which makes it hard to appreciate what is going on the way we have in movies detailing battles like Waterloo or Gettysburg.  Of course, if the emphasis in the film is on ""why"" then the ""how"" becomes less important, which is why it is dealt with the way it is in this 2004 film.The production design of the film handles the ""where"" and ""when"" of Alexander's life quite well, especially in the depiction of Babylon and some of the gorgeous costumes.  I have no problem with the casting, but I think all of the key principles tend to get too emotional too often, which also works against developing an acceptable ""why"" to Alexander's life.  We do get a sense of Alexander being ahead of his time in terms of how he treats those he has conquered (anticipation the Roman willingness to bring new peoples into their Empire), but by the time we get to the last acts of the film the quest of ""why"" he did what he did is complicated by trying to also cover why things fell apart, and we have as sketchy an idea of that in the end as we do the other.  There is a suggestion that Alexander overreached his bounds when he crossed into the Indian subcontinent and the film's most noteworthy cinematic moment creates his literal fall.  But then we are left with the simplistic notion that things fell apart because Alexander died, which means ""Alexander"" the film has not brought us any further understanding of the man than we had before we sat down to watch it.",3,Oliver Stone tells the story of Alexander the So-What,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,4384,"['thought', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'went', 'tracks', 'when', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'Alexander', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'young', 'man', 'butting', 'heads', 'father', 'King', 'Philip', 'Macedonia', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Alexander', 'King', 'fight', 'army', 'Persian', 'ruler', 'Darius', 'Battle', 'Issus', 'thought', 'was', 'because', 'Alexander', 'known', 'world', 'conquerer', '2', 'hours', '55', 'minutes', 'director', 'cut', 'Stone', 'was', 'simply', 'moving', 'good', 'stuff', 'instead', 'simply', 'doing', 'cinematic', 'tour', 'highlights', 'life', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'Stone', 'parallel', 'stories', 'present', 'have', 'Alexander', 'conquering', 'world', 'trying', 'juggle', 'relationships', 'Roxanne', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'woman', 'marry', 'particular', 'friend', 'Hephaistion', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'past', 'Alexander', 'grow', 'up', 'dominating', 'mother', 'Olympias', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'disinterested', 'father', 'Actually', 'mother', 'son', 'Zeus', 'not', 'Philip', 'why', 'king', 'picked', 'new', 'queen', 'Alexander.Stone', 'purpose', 'clearly', 'be', 'explore', 'why', 'Alexander', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'problem', 'film', 'something', 'do', 'relationship', 'parents', 'how', 'treatment', 'resulted', 'young', 'man', 'audacious', 'brilliant', 'enough', 'conquer', 'world', 'not', 'clear', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Alexander', 'can', 'ride', 'great', 'horse', 'Bucephalus', 'young', 'Alexander', 'just', 'older', 'one', 'would', 'conquer', 'world', 'reason', 'what', 'was', 'film', 'started', 'Alexander', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'movie', 'not', 'advancing', 'understanding', 'man', 'way', 'should', 'parents', 'seem', 'be', 'teaching', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'only', 'negation', 'Olympias', 'Alexander', 'not', 'son', 'Philip', 'then', 'Philip', 'even', 'more', 'blind', 'usually', 'not', 'see', 'Alexander', 'not', 'mother', 'either', 'success', 'Alexander', 'entirely', 'ability', 'explain', 'motivation', 'only', 'too', 'brief', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Aristotle', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'get', 'close', 'start', 'something', 'sense', 'regard', 'How', 'Alexander', 'conquered', 'world', 'left', 'mostly', 'voice', 'narration', 'Old', 'Ptolemy', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'now', 'Egyptian', 'Pharaoh', 'exception', 'film', 'two', 'battle', 'sequences', 'Battle', 'Issus', 'Battle', 'Hydaspes', 'River', 'India', 'two', 'battles', 'represent', 'greatest', 'victory', 'greatest', 'least', 'final', 'defeat', 'tactical', 'standpoint', 'latter', 'more', 'interesting', 'battle', 'especially', 'feints', 'psychological', 'tactics', 'Alexander', 'employed', 'hand', 'Stone', 'only', 'explain', 'former', 'However', 'problematic', 'battle', 'was', 'being', 'fought', 'desert', 'plain', 'devoid', 'physical', 'detail', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'what', 'going', 'way', 'have', 'movies', 'detailing', 'battles', 'Waterloo', 'Gettysburg', 'course', 'emphasis', 'film', 'why', 'then', 'how', 'less', 'important', 'why', 'dealt', 'way', '2004', 'film.The', 'production', 'design', 'film', 'where', 'when', 'Alexander', 'life', 'quite', 'well', 'especially', 'depiction', 'Babylon', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'have', 'problem', 'casting', 'think', 'key', 'principles', 'tend', 'get', 'too', 'emotional', 'too', 'often', 'also', 'developing', 'acceptable', 'why', 'Alexander', 'life', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'Alexander', 'being', 'ahead', 'time', 'terms', 'how', 'conquered', 'anticipation', 'Roman', 'willingness', 'bring', 'new', 'peoples', 'Empire', 'time', 'get', 'last', 'acts', 'film', 'quest', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'complicated', 'trying', 'also', 'cover', 'why', 'things', 'fell', 'apart', 'have', 'as', 'sketchy', 'idea', 'end', 'do', 'other', 'suggestion', 'Alexander', 'overreached', 'bounds', 'when', 'crossed', 'Indian', 'subcontinent', 'film', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'cinematic', 'moment', 'literal', 'fall', 'then', 'are', 'left', 'simplistic', 'notion', 'things', 'fell', 'apart', 'Alexander', 'died', 'Alexander', 'film', 'not', 'brought', 'further', 'understanding', 'man', 'had', 'sat', 'down', 'watch']",Alexander

Colin Farrell deserved an Oscar for those last few moments alone, on his deathbed. As much as a non-fan as I am of Colin, even I had to admit that this is perhaps his best performance on screen, even better than his one in ""A Home at the Center of the World"".One thing that might turn off viewers is the stunning Angelina Jolie with an accent you will either love or hate. Its hard to be neutral to this accent. Its pretty much the same accent she had on in both ""Beowulf"" AND ""A Mighty Heart"" which leads me to believe that this woman is wretched at putting on a specific accent for a film. Whether its Eastern European, Greek, Mixed-Race, or Black, Jolie sounds exactly the same - a weird Mediterranean meets Shakira accent that I couldn't quite get into. I think this was the films' only negative.The superb direction inevitably made me want to compare this to ""Kingdom of Heaven"", a movie that this shares many similarities with. However, I must say that this is not a classic as that film is, though it does have its' moments. Yes, I too had problems accepting a bleach-blond Colin Farrell in the beginning, and the tedious narration by Anthony Hopkins is almost hilarious, but it strangely works.Also, Alexanders' two major love stories - one with Hephastion, his male friends, and the other with what is seemingly his jungle-queen wife - are treated with respect, but also with caution. There is an unnecessary scene of heterosexual copulation that bordered on the absurd, and I only wish they had deleted this from the final cut of the film. As expected, the same-sex angle is conveniently relegated to second side-show, with the two men occasionally hugging and patting each other on the back as if they were long lost brothers. Many viewers found this a little too 'safe', and so did I.Doubtless, the many flaws this film has only make it more enjoyable. It IS long, but it has its share of cheesy moments, scenes of grandeur, and a script that comes alive at the most unexpected places. For all its cliches and horrible accents, this is a film that is awash in color and brightness, and Colin Farrell's single-minded devotion to his childhood sweetheart is only revealed to us during the films' climax, which was to me far more affecting than other historical films of this genre.Four Stars.

This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  And I'm usually pretty generous to movies.It's not the fault of the cast, which actually had a lot of potential.  It's purely the fault of the director's confused vision.  It is, in fact, hard to see how one could make a boring and disappointing movie about Alexander the Great.  His life was a great and ultimately tragic one on a monumental scale, but you'd never guess it from this movie.  Instead of a reasonably comprehensible story line, we are given vignettes that wander all over the place and backwards and forwards in time.  The few battle scenes are incomprehensible and only Guagamela makes any kind of sense.I see many reviewers panning or praising because of the bisexual behavior of Alexander.  The facts are historical and certainly not surprising in Greek society.  However, what was depicted in the movie as homosexual behavior was ridiculously chaste, while the heterosexual behavior was ridiculously violent.  Neither were of any importance to the movie's overall effect.  A boring movie with either or both types of sex is still a boring movie.The costumes and most of the sets are OK and some of the computer generated scenes (of Babylon, for example) are pretty good.The most worthwhile frames of the entire movie are the computer-generated (and non-historical) clash between Buchepalous (Alexander's horse) and a war elephant.  But it's not worth watching the whole movie just for that scene.Alas, this is definitely forgettable.  If you really want to get a feel for the life of Alexander, try viewing Michael Wood's ""In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great"".  It has more drama than did this sorry movie, as Wood actually follows the routes taken by Alexander on his amazing journey from Greece to India and gives us an amazing view of the terrible natural obstacles that the Macedonian army had to overcome and the variety of peoples they encountered.

910327,A2EW69GOMN3EA9,B0009PLLN6,Martin Doege,"[4, 6]","Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"", in its theatrical release version, somehow managed the uncomfortable feat of being both too short and too long at the same time. On one hand, there were the endless narrations by Ptolemy and the general slow start of the movie with no battles in sight, on the other it somehow felt rushed and didn't have the moments of quiet and reflection a true epic needs.Apparently Stone also thought so, because he made a second, significantly shorter cut, and now this longer version. Making the movie shorter was probably not a good idea, as in that direction theRichard Burton movielies, which was pretty decent for what it was. But if you make another film about Alexander the Great's life with a big budget, it makes more sense to give it a bigger scope and longer running length, which ""Alexander Revisited"" attempts to do, and for the most part successfully.So now the movie looks more like what it probably was supposed to be from the start, with an intermission. I don't know why intermissions in longer movies have fallen out of fashion -- it certainly makes for a much better viewing experience, and Hollywood epics used to have them as the DVDs show. It certainly gives a movie a more grand and operatic feel and allows the audience a breather before the denouement. The theatrical release of ""Alexander"" was simply too much packed with events to be stomached in one sitting.The structure of the film has changed a bit, with Alexander's death and the battle at Gaugamela being right up front. The constant jumps in time (""4 years later"", ""17 years earlier"", ""5 years later"", ""12 years earlier"", etc.) are still a bit confusing -- I think a chronological telling of the tale would have worked fine, maybe Stone should try that as the fourth variant? -- but on the whole the movie seems less cheesy and Farrell's performance seems to work better in the context of a longer movie. Maybe it's not is performance, just that you have more time to accommodate to the sight of him in a blond wig. Same for Val Kilmer as Philip.Some parts are still edited a bit confusingly -- like the ""He too is Alexander"" scene, where all the close-ups don't make it very clear what's going on. A wide shot would have done wonders there, and might even have made the scene funny, which is direly needed in a movie relatively devoid of humor. But on the whole everything hangs together better.Even the score by Vangelis seems less cheesy here. Perhaps in the theaters it was just the disappointment about hearing synthesizer music in a big-budget movie as if it was a made-for-TV production, but I'm beginning to realize that the music is actually very fitting. Since the movie tries to make out Alexander as some sort of visionary, it makes sense that the music would be more modern-sounding.Also, since Aristotle survived Alexander, why not have the narration be delivered by him? The choice of Hopkins and Ptolemy seems like pandering to the audience, just so a (still-existing) Alexandria and the Library can be shown. Christopher Plummer brings zest, energy, and a little sarcasm to his relatively small role, and the movie would have profited from having him as a narrator instead of Hopkins.The intermission comes a few minutes too late -- it should be right after the dramatic scene where Philip throws Alexander out of his palace, but instead it's right after a far less exhilarating scene where Alexander...descends from a mountain in the Hindu Kush and wearily comments, ""We must go on, until we find an end!"" One of those unintentionally funny clunker lines, as the same could be said about the movie itself. Bad placement!All in a all, this is finally a worthy version of Alexander, with a definite streak of Fellini / Pasolini (the Bactria sequence) and ""Indiana Jones II"" (the India sequence). There are still Angelina Jolie's overblown lips, Jared Leto's hairstyle, the Klingon sex scene between Alexander and Roxane, English words written in Greek letters, and some other silly bits, but this is probably as good as it gets in terms of an Alexander biopic.

Some of the fight scenes are neat and the way Oliver Stone shows the beautiful architecture of Babylon is breath taking.  The rest of the film is poor though.  I know from reading history books about Alexander that he had an interesting relationship with hi mother.  The bad thing is that his mother in the film is Angelina Jolie, who is to close in age to Farrel to be believable.  Well Colin Farrel plays Alexander and he is about as interesting as watching pizza on a table succumb to mold.  The movie was so much about Alexander having talks with his mom.  Again, the battle scenes are very big and bold but this film was way to long, and in between the scenes that showed how this guy almost ruled the whole planet, are long, drawn out scenes of dialogue behind closed doors that I did not find added much.  Just out of control in that department, I mean they could have cut it down some and allowed some of these dramatic moments inside the castle walls to add to the film.

910330,A3JZ5L52FM318H,B0009PLLN6,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[22, 28]","The film:It's kind of funny how popular entertainment works. All I remember hearing about Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" is that it was a horribly acted, poorly constructed shambles of a movie. Scanning the torrent of vituperative scorn heaped upon this film will give you an idea of the climate at the time of its release. Needless to say, I was dubious. Any movie that scores lower than Jessica Simpson's ""Dukes of Hazzard"" must be an abomination, right?However, I am a Stone fan, and was inclined to offer the benefit of the doubt. I loved JFK, Nixon and Natural Born Killers, and enjoyed Any Given Sunday and The Doors. At his best, Stone excels at getting truly absorbing character portraits up on the screen, and setting them against an expansive backdrop which captures the essence of the period.Alexander, starring Collin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, Jared Leto and Christopher Plummer, both succeeds and fails in these categories. Some of the characters are endlessly fascinating, some are rather threadbare. Certain aspects of the period are wonderfully represented, and some are sort of left up to the viewer to fill in the blanks. Some performances are pitch perfect, others, while enjoyable, are painfully weird and out of place. All told, Alexander is somewhat weak in comparison with Stone's best.So why did I enjoy it so much?Looking at the above-listed stars, it's easy to see that Stone has assembled a particularly good ensemble cast. The weakest of the bunch are Farrell and Jolie. However, each actor does an admirable job of creating a character, Farrell and Jolie included. If anything, Jolie's performance is hampered only by her youth (she is only one year Farrell's senior, yet plays his mother), and her wretched accent (somewhere between Eartha Kitt and Austin Powers' Frau Farbissina). Farrell's performance is just a bit shallow - he looks heroic and manly in battle sequences, certainly, but doesn't do much beyond that. Sometimes, he really seems to nail complex emotions. Other times, it's just a bit poster-board and flat.The rest of the cast, however, including the lesser-known supporting players in Alexander's army, are uniformly terrific. Particularly good are Plummer as Aristotle, Kilmer as a drunken King Philip, Hopkins as an aged Ptolemy, and Jared Leto as Alexander's male lover, Hephaistion. Rosario Dawson plays Alexander's asian bride Roxane, though beyond her pendulous naked breasts and dancing ability, I can't say I got much out of it (Dawson really shines in 2005's Sin City, though). To me, though, the performance that makes the movie what it is is by Connor Paolo, as a young Alexander. This 14 year-old actor absolutely nails the portrayal of a young, idealistic prince with adolescent dreams of grandeur. This portrayal really lends a depth to the later plot, acted by Farrell, which Farrell himself really doesn't provide.But any Stone movie review eventually comes down to Stone himself. How well did he construct the story, and how well did he execute it and edit it together?My main gripe with the story of Alexander is its naivete. I really have to wonder how historically accurate it is to portray Alexander as an idealistic dreamer who longed to unite the world in a Pax Romana-esque explosion of culture and personal improvement. Certainly, all of these things may have been present in the man, and they may have been ancillary effects of his conquest, but it is pretty tough to swallow as Farrell dreamily describes his vision of a great society to his male lover Leto. The story functions much better when Alexander is instead portrayed as a conqueror impelled by his family demons to push across the globe for something he knows not what.Nonetheless, the film is truly wondrous at times in its evocation of ancient times and places - Babylon is a singular cinematic achievement - utilizing CGI nearly seamlessly to truly give the impression of a ""wonder of the world."" Similarly teriffic cinematography and composition are achieved in portrayals of India, Egypt and the steppes of the Himalayas. The scenes of Greece and Macedonia also shine, especially in HD, really placing you there in the time. This film is Stone at his finest visually, creating a world which draws you in.I for one really liked the way the so-called ""gay"" element of the movie was handled - watching Alexander provides one of the better explications of the homosexual ""lover-beloved"" relationships that were present in Hellenistic noble circles. Again, this concept was grounded by scenes of the young Alexander and Hephaiston being taught by Aristotle about the idealistic virtues of manly love - scenes which brought into sharp focus what could have seemed gratuitous homoerotic later scenes between Leto, Farrell, and a few others. It's a part of Greek history, and Stone kept it in as a big theme, instead of bending to anachronistic puritanism. Kudos to him for that.Besides Stone's possible anachronistic interpretation of Alexander's world-uniting motives, historically, this film really can't be faulted. It is true to the sources we have, be they Plutarch and Herodotus, or more modern scholars. Those sources may be tinged by legend or political agenda, but they are all we have. This is a movie which you could show a professor, who would be hard pressed to point out a major error (unlike the barely recognizable ""history"" of ""Kingdom of Heaven."") I would also say, as is Stone's talent, this movie makes you feel like YOU ARE THERE. I would show this film to students to get them excited about the Hellenistic period. (Though at 214 minutes, it might take two class periods...)As you have read, this cut is 214 minutes. Certainly, this is a long movie. But Stone, in his ability to create scene and to really transport the viewer, makes this movie fly by. It felt like 2 hours, not 3 and a half. Stone has re-ordered the fragmented structure of the film. The previous director's cut grouped various scenes closer together by time period - Alexander's childhood was one big chunk, then his travels were another, intercut with his early reign and death. This cut, on the other hand, basically takes the two time periods (childhood through early reign; travels across Asia and death) and skips back and forth between them, each line running roughly forward. Both cuts can be followed, especially if you have some knowledge of Greek history. I have to say I prefer the first director's cut a bit, since I found the childhood scenes so strong, it was nice to have them in a chunk. But this cut still works. The added material fleshes out the side characters much better than the previous two cuts, which is welcome in any case.Alexander is an enigmatic movie. It fails at so much, but only because it tried for so much. I was completely absorbed and never bored once during the 3.5 hour running time. I felt transported to the world it created, and my emotions were stirred in a simplistic way by the scenes of glory and adventure on the screen. Ptolemy (played by Hopkins) utters a line which might serve as the movie's epitaph: ""His failures were grander than others' successes."" So true of Stone. He wears his ambition on his sleeve, is rarely if ever subtle, and draws a lot of critical fire for this. Yet the explosion of creativity which results, whether it succeeds or fails, is never boring. I recommend Alexander for this reason alone.Let me put it another way: This is a movie that got critically bashed, and I can't really discern why. It's better than ""Dukes of Hazzard."" It's also better than ""Revenge of the Sith,"" a film from around the same time which received many positive reviews despite its bizarre dialogue, paper-thin character motivations, and plot holes. It's got its problems, but it is also big fun if you're a fan of the historical epic genre, the director, or of the historical period.The disc:As far as the quality of the Blu-Ray presentation, let me put it simply. I own Planet Earth, 2001, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The Prestige, all renowned for their sterling HD transfers. Alexander tops them all in terms of detail and color.  You know how some Blu-Ray discs look fine enough, but really seem like something a particularly good DVD could do? The aforementioned ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is one such disc to me. This Blu-Ray presentation leaves you with no doubt. This is High Definition, pure and simple, and no 480p DVD disc could do what this disc does. On my 50"" SXRD display, the detail is overwhelming, the color is beyond rich and vibrant, and the 3-dimensionality is extraordinary, especially in the festival scene in Greece, the scene in the cold mountain pass, and in the Babylon entrance scene. At its best, this is THE demo disc to really show off your system. There are a few spots where black levels falter (such as the palace in India) or flesh tones are a little hot (Aristotle springs to mind), but these flaws represent 5 minutes or so out of a 214 minute experience. The rest of the film is nothing short of flawless, and the visual splendor aids in drawing you into the film.The extra materials also excel - two commentaries including a director's track and a historical overview by Oxford historian Robin Lane Fox, two documentaries with amazing behind the scenes access, and a bevy of other features. Really first rate.If you like history, this is a movie to get. If you like great HD, this disc is a no-brainer. If you like neat and tidy 90 minute films which spoon feed you the plot and who to root for/against, this is NOT the movie for you. It is complex, confusing at times, ambiguous in its morality, violent, lusty, raw, and disgusting. But that's history... have you ever read the bible? Yeesh. This is a movie which inspires love and hate all at once. I for one find it utterly spellbinding, even though I am well aware of its flaws. In the end, I think this is completely appropriate for its subject matter: Alexander the Great, a historical figure who, warts and all, you can't simply ignore and would do well to study. I give this disc 5 stars for its technical brilliance, its creative spark, and its sheer, mesmeric ""movie magic.""",5,"A glorious mess, now in a spectacular HD transfer",1202428800,"02 8,

If you're going to have one set of people.. please have them all use the same sort of accent.  The many different accents was distracting and made the movie cartoonish.2. If Alexander was bi-sexual, fine.  Let's not spend extra time on an already long and boring movie for loving gazes to his many love interests.  If you have to do it, at least make it interesting.3. The battle scenes were horrible.  Blurry and muddled.  There was no battle plan for the filming and at no point during the movied did I actually care what was going on.  Just another battle.  blah blah.4. The rousing (sarcastic) speech by the leader of whatever group it is, riding up and down the front battleline supposedly rousing the troops.. how many times is this going to be shown?  If you have to do it, it better be a good one.  This one roused me to go to the bathroom during it.5. Long.  It's just too long and not interesting enough to keep you satisfied.

And this is only the second edition of this film - Oliver Stone has released another edition, the 'final' cut, which I unfortunately got recommended on Amazon. Does he really think a third edition is going to make the film worth watching? My answer's no.I got this for cheap, but now it has no re-sale value, and it looks like I'm stuck with it, unless I can fob it off onto some poor unsuspecting soul. People rave about Oliver Stone, the man who wrote Scarface (but who unfortunately cannot be blamed for the poster that everybody MUST have), like they rave about David Lynch or James Cameron. Personally? I couldn't sit through Natural Born Killers either. But I did sit through Lost Highway. What does that say? Two movies of Oliver Stone's that I cannot sit through.I watched it for an hour, and then checked to see how much longer I still had left to watch. When I saw I still had another hour and 40 minutes of pure hell, I switched it off. If there's no story in the first hour, then the director is either stretching it out big time, or there's no story to the film at all. And who the hell is Alexander? I never learned about him in my history classes at school. And I took them for four years.The only shining star in this film was Angelina Jolie, looking all Greek and gorgeous - but speaking in what can only be a Russian accent? Val Kilmer is absolutely wasted, considering what he had to go through with the fake scarring over his eye.There are so many 'good' reviews of this film, that it's hard to believe we watched the same film. It shows that throwing lots of money at a film will not necessarily make it a good film that people will flock to see. It's diabolical and should be forgotten about.

Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[9, 13]","In viewing ""Alexander: The Director's Cut"" it is wise to follow the advice of historian Arthur Weigall in his prolog to the story of another dreamer, Cleopatra. ""We must not commit the anachronism of criticizing our surroundings from the standard of twenty centuries after Christ."" There for when you enter this world of twenty three centuries ago the morals of our time do not fit and must be left at the door.A challenging and visionary film by Oliver Stone, Alexander is a wonder to behold. This story of histories most enigmatic and controversial man is told in a non linear form with stunning visuals and great performances by it's well chosen cast.Here in Stone's re-edited Directors Cut the director has rearranged the film to succeed where if failed for some critics in its first run in the theater. For me the first version was wonderful but now it is more accessible to the mass audience.It was brave of Oliver Stone to approach the accents as different dialects of English since the Greeks of that time undoubtedly spoke in different accents depending upon where they came from. It is refreshing not to have everyone speaking in high tones of epic movie English.As Alexander Colin Farrell shows his great range as a young actor and incredible grasp of the complexities of a man who dreamed of a one world blended of many cultures and ideas. His conflicted relationships with his charismatic parents are played in counterpoint to his desire for conquest in the name of peace. Colin Farrell ascends heights of emotion of both the man and the pan sexual aspects of Alexander. Some viewers squirm at the relationship of Alexander and Hephaistion others say it was not explicit enough. Both these views of this one aspect of Alexander speak volumes about the viewer rather than what is on the screen. When I listened to Stone's commentary he makes it clear that it is not about sex but about love. And there in lies the difference between our world and the world of Alexander.Standing like a lioness is Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother, Olympias. She embodies all the savage and regal qualities of a Queen who must fight for her son's rights and at times even his life to perfection. She is thrilling to watch in her bravura performance.  I do not find her youth a hindrance at all, being that Olympias came to the throne at a young age and most likely bore Alexander in her mid teens.As Phillip, Val Kilmer is simply wonderful. Rough, savage and tragic, he gives a memorable performance that stands with his best.Rosario Dawson is a perfect Roxanne, exotic, regal and sensuous. She brings to her role an understanding of a woman that very little is known about.As Hephaistion, Jared Leto is perfect in his support and love of his boyhood friend. He embodies the beauty, wisdom and patience of Alexander's dearest friend.""Alexander"" from its incredible opening credits that show the multicultural influences of the world of Persia and Greece to its set pieces of Babylon, Alexandria Egypt, and the two great battles that are shown is a stunning visual feast that takes the viewer into a world that we can only imagine in our dreams.  The production design by Jan Roelfs and the contributions by the art department and costume designer, Jenny Beavan are simply Herculean and gorgeous.The score by Vangellis is heartbreakingly beautiful and soars to the heights of true epic proportions just as it needed to.The extra's on this two disk DVD include an indepth documentary of the making of the film. It also includes an excelent and informitive comentary by Oliver Stone.""Alexander"" has been greatly misunderstood as a film, just as the man has been misunderstood by many.

910337,A42AB7M4H6V9U,B0009PLLN6,Michael Jay Sullivan,"[28, 32]","Oliver Stone, along with Woody Allen, Martin Scorcese,and Stephen Speilberg, are arguably the most prolific maintream hollywood directors of the last quarter century. This doesn't mean they are not, at times, controversial, and Stone is probably the most controversial. JFK, Nixon, are like Alexander,somehat fictionalizedc historical films. Moreover, in AlexanderStone attempts to resurrect a lost breed (mostly from the mid 50's to the mid 60's- the apogee of American unquestioned power and imperialism) the historical epic. The epic, according to literary theorists, is often an attempt to give an almost divineright to imperial escapades.In this film, Stone offers an Epical blueprint (the probably closest relative is The Gladiator)  of the rise and fall of empires.Anthony Hopkins, as narrator and Ptolmey, uses the term Orientalist is his description of Alexander's quest. Orientalism, of those who have read Edward Said's brilliant work of the same name, is the the slanted-imperialist attitude of Europe- and later the US- in viewing people from unfamiar cultures as inferior, sexual and violent heathens, and conquerable for their own good. This attitude which reached it's zenith in highly imperialitic 19th century Europe, and is an underlying attitude- and justification- for the US's current middle eastern preemptive and dehuhamizing aggressive policies.The movie, itslf, is worth the time. The Macedonian flashbacks  seem to take away from the building tension of the movie. It's good that Oliver is re-editing it. I would prefer Jolie as Alexamder's wife, Roxanna, rather than his mother. Firth, himself,is pretty good as Alexander but seems a bit too frail and introspective- but his ""humane"" proto-imperialistic/paternalistitic vision seems on the mark, and distinguishes him, and the movie. Also, their failure to defeat India and older and more evolved culture bespeaks of the limits of Empire- and Orientalism. However, I would have preferred a little more wisdom imparted from Alexander's teacher- and one of the world's greatest philosphers, Aristotle. But, perhaps, that's my own preference. This is not a European art film, nor does it intend to be.One does not need to see this picture as conceptually and critically as I do to enjoy it, but to realize that there are many parallels in Alexander's quest to modern meglomaiac ventures does help one see this as a more cohesive and meaningful effort.

910340,ANKRP8LRYTDZR,B0009PLLN6,Mirage,"[3, 8]","To say the truth, I don't understand why most people think so poorly of this movie.I liked it, pediod.Although I'm not a big fan of Colin Farell, (he has a face of an alcoholic in some magazine photos)I still think that he fits well for the role of Alexander, and plays the role fairly well. Now, Angelina Jolie is a whole different matter. I don't think she is of an appropriate age to be even considered his mother, she's more of an older sister to him. Another thing is that they don't change her appeareance around much in the movie. Meaning, that from the time Alexander was little, to the time he's an adult her face changes only slightly (they add a few bags under her eyes here and there). I don't think she's fit for the role at all.In terms of action and all, it was pretty good in its own way. Each movie has its own distinguished characteristics, and maybe some parts were gloomy, but it was good.The only other thing I don't like is all the drinking and also the girl who becomes Alexander's wife (she isn't pretty, not at all).I liked the camera work, the background, and the settings. The constant change in their environment, like the mountains, and forests, and desert.All in all, the movie was pretty entertaining. Think of it this way, if you have seen ""Kingdom of Heaven"", ""Alexander"" is much better, and far less confusing. For instance you don't have these leaps in battles from nightime to daytime all of a sudden. Also you don't have weird, ugly women shaving off their hair for no reason (I have basically slept through a part of that movie, and I *never* do that).Anyway, I think that if you have not seen this movie in the theaters, you should at least rent it at Blockbuster and try it at home.Thanks for your time,mirage",4,"four stars, no less",1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,1749,"['say', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'so', 'poorly', 'movie.I', 'liked', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Colin', 'Farell', 'face', 'alcoholic', 'magazine', 'photos', 'still', 'think', 'well', 'role', 'Alexander', 'role', 'fairly', 'well', 'Now', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'whole', 'different', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'appropriate', 'age', 'be', 'even', 'considered', 'mother', 'more', 'older', 'sister', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'appeareance', 'around', 'much', 'movie', 'Meaning', 'time', 'Alexander', 'was', 'little', 'time', 'adult', 'face', 'only', 'slightly', 'add', 'few', 'bags', 'eyes', 'here', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fit', 'role', 'all.In', 'terms', 'action', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'own', 'way', 'movie', 'own', 'distinguished', 'characteristics', 'maybe', 'parts', 'were', 'gloomy', 'was', 'good.The', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'drinking', 'also', 'girl', 'who', 'Alexander', 'wife', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'not', '.I', 'liked', 'camera', 'work', 'background', 'settings', 'constant', 'change', 'environment', 'mountains', 'forests', 'desert.All', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'Think', 'way', 'have', 'seen', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'Alexander', 'much', 'better', 'far', 'less', 'confusing', 'instance', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'leaps', 'battles', 'nightime', 'daytime', 'sudden', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'weird', 'ugly', 'women', 'shaving', 'off', 'hair', 'reason', 'have', 'basically', 'slept', 'part', 'movie', '*never*', 'do', '.Anyway', 'think', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'theaters', 'should', 'least', 'rent', 'Blockbuster', 'try', 'home.Thanks', 'time', 'mirage']",Alexander

Some people may not get or be turned off by the massive symbolism.I can see American audiences having problems w/ the film as Alexander as portrayed as pan sexual and in touch with his feminine side.  American heroes are super masculine right now.Additionally, his parents did a good job of messing him up emotionally, so, some people might see him as weak even though, at his height, he controlled more square miles than the Roman Empire at its height.Would have liked to have seen the razing of Thebes but they took that out.

It's a dizzying attempt to cover the life of Alexander The Great.Many terrific actors (Kilmer, Jolie, etc.) give it their all. You can see them trying...even Colin Farrell. You can't say he doesn't commit to the role.Much has been written about the emphasis on homosexuality in this cut, and it is pervasive. I mean that the relationship with Hephaestion (Jared Leto) is arguably the central plot of the film.  This apparently accurately reflects historical data...but Stone almost makes it into a political statement. I just found it a little weird that it was emphasized SO much. I heard someone say that this film made ""Rent"" look like ""Dirty Harry."" I don't know if I'd go THAT far, but I see their point.It is beautifully shot; the war scenes are done well...technically it is what you would expect.From a storytelling perspective, this is an unqualified disaster.

The Director's Cut was alright, but this Final Cut did the same thing for me that the Director's Cut for Kingdom of Heaven did:  I watched it and went, &#34;Now this is what they meant to show!  This makes more sense!&#34;Stone went for the heart and for the glory that Alexander was in life, start to finish, and to me, he did not disappoint in this Cut.  It's kind of funny to me, that the reviews I've found for this movie always seem to:  1) glorify Val Kilmer's performance [and it was good], 2) vilify Angelina Jolie's performance [I found her true to Olympias, who always seemed to have an agenda], 3) complain about the homosexual tendencies [do you know ANYTHING about Alexander or ancient Greece?], and 4) moan about the movie being boring [how the hell is a war movie boring?]  Kilmer as Phillip II was amazing; I alternately hated Phillip and felt him tender at the same time, and Kilmer doesn't usually do it for me, but he was AWESOME in this role.  Jolie--I always like her acting, and to me, she did the snake worshipping Olympias justice, even if the snake worshipping Olympias was weird unto herself; one thing is for certain-- she loved her son... how is a different story.  Farrell's Alexander was amazing, but then again, I'm not sure that Colin Farrell has a bad turn of a role, usually it's a script that gets him.  Leto as Hephaistion was beautifully done, and I'm not usually a Leto fan when it comes to him and movies.How the hell do people find a movie about conquering the world boring?  Especially when, as Aristotle puts it in the movie, &#34;the known world&#34; was pretty small?  Alexander was way ahead of his time, and to watch his destiny unfold before his eyes, to watch each decision he made, whether or not it was one everyone agreed with, affect the WORLD, had to be mind-blowing.  Ptolemy spoke of his death at the end of the movie, saying that &#34;Alexander's great heart finally gave out.&#34;  I think that was a perfect way to describe it:  from what I've read from Plutarch and Arrian and Curtius-- people who never met the man, but relied on writings we've mostly never seen to make their own-- Alexander had such a big heart and such a keen mind for strategy, and when he put those two together, there was nothing he couldn't accomplish.Stone and Farrell captured that perfectly in this film.",5,Finally!,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,2404,"['Cut', 'made', 'happy', 'liked', 'theatrical', 'version', 'okay', 'Director', 'Cut', 'was', 'alright', 'Final', 'Cut', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'did', 'watched', 'went', '34', 'Now', 'what', 'meant', 'show', 'more', 'sense', '34', 'Stone', 'went', 'heart', 'glory', 'Alexander', 'was', 'life', 'start', 'finish', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Cut', 'kind', 'funny', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'found', 'movie', 'always', 'seem', '1', 'glorify', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'performance', '[', 'was', 'good', ']', '2', 'vilify', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'performance', '[', 'found', 'true', 'Olympias', 'who', 'always', 'seemed', 'have', 'agenda', ']', '3', 'complain', 'homosexual', 'tendencies', '[', 'do', 'know', 'ANYTHING', 'Alexander', 'ancient', 'Greece', ']', '4', 'moan', 'movie', 'being', 'boring', '[', 'how', 'hell', 'war', 'movie', 'boring', ']', 'Kilmer', 'Phillip', 'II', 'was', 'amazing', 'alternately', 'hated', 'Phillip', 'felt', 'tender', 'same', 'time', 'Kilmer', ""n't"", 'usually', 'do', 'was', 'AWESOME', 'role', 'Jolie', 'always', 'acting', 'did', 'snake', 'worshipping', 'Olympias', 'justice', 'even', 'snake', 'worshipping', 'Olympias', 'was', 'weird', 'unto', 'herself', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'loved', 'son', 'how', 'different', 'story', 'Farrell', 'Alexander', 'was', 'amazing', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'bad', 'turn', 'role', 'usually', 'script', 'Leto', 'Hephaistion', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'Leto', 'fan', 'when', 'movies.How', 'hell', 'do', 'people', 'find', 'movie', 'conquering', 'world', 'boring', 'Especially', 'when', 'Aristotle', 'movie', '34', 'known', 'world', '34', 'was', 'pretty', 'small', 'Alexander', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'watch', 'destiny', 'unfold', 'eyes', 'watch', 'decision', 'made', 'not', 'was', 'one', 'everyone', 'agreed', 'affect', 'WORLD', 'had', 'be', 'mind-blowing', 'Ptolemy', 'spoke', 'death', 'end', 'movie', 'saying', '34', 'Alexander', 'great', 'heart', 'finally', 'gave', 'out.', '34', 'think', 'was', 'perfect', 'way', 'describe', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Plutarch', 'Arrian', 'Curtius', 'people', 'who', 'never', 'met', 'man', 'relied', 'writings', ""'ve"", 'mostly', 'never', 'seen', 'make', 'own', 'Alexander', 'had', 'big', 'heart', 'keen', 'mind', 'strategy', 'when', 'put', 'two', 'together', 'was', 'nothing', 'could', ""n't"", 'accomplish.Stone', 'Farrell', 'captured', 'perfectly', 'film']",Alexander

Some of his earlier movies, such as ""Wall Street"" and ""Platoon"", were great movies because they were so well made.  Alexander is very poorly made and is simply a very bad film.The battle scenes are incredibly poor.  We often see the battle from a birds-eye view, but the warriors are displayed as tiny dots.  I couldn't even tell which side was which during those views.  The hand to hand fighting was also weak.  Overall, these battle scenes were much worse than those in other, recent films.  We often see Alexander, in full headress so everyone knows who he is, wandering around the battle field swinging his sword while the opposition forces are seemingly unaware of his presence.  It was very odd.  Then, we have these slow motion action scenes in which Colin Farrell's eye's are so wide open as to be comical.Given the well regarded cast, I assumed that the acting would be good.  Instead, I have to assume that Oliver sand bagged almost the entire cast.  The performances we get are so poor that I feel the actors themselves cannot be entirely to blame.  The only praiseworthy perfomance was from Angelina Jolie, who plays the ""evil woman"" role better than any other actress in Hollywood.  She gave me the creeps every time she was on the screen (which was to purpose of her role).  Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, and Christopher Plummer are wasted in this film, although Anthony Hopkins manages to almost break-even with his role.  Poor Colin Farrell.  You can tell that tried really hard, but he appears to overact in almost every scene.  Viewing his often distorted expressions and wide open eyes, I wondered what the director was telling him to do.  He gives an absolutely horrible performance.  I've seen him in various other films, and he's not that bad of an actor.  I have to blame Oliver Stone for this mess.  Rosario Dawson suffers the same fate in this film as Farrell.  I hope her career can recover.The story is very incomplete, and leaves the viewer wondering what the historical Alexander actually did.  I'm not sure what the purpose of the film was, either.All in all, this film was one of the worst films I've seen all year.

910345,A15ORUD5TVNIV6,B0009PLLN6,Mom Pressfour,"[1, 5]","Years ago a commentator wrote about Oliver Stone's *JFK* (1991) that it's the best bad movie ever made.  Well, I do believe the title has transferred to Stone's *Alexander* (2004).  This epic deserves a nod for valiant effort.  And stylistically it does shine.  But *Alexander* is too long, attempts too much, and so is weakened by its effort to be great--just as the lust for greatness weakened to death the historical Emperor Alexander even in his youthful years.Nontheless I would  recommend you buy the *Alexander* DVD if you're a fan of director Stone and/or of the leading actors--Colin Farrel, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer.  Their talent is on ample display here.  But after the first viewing you'll probably watch just the parts of *Alexander* that you like, by using the scene selection feature of the DVD's menu page as I do.I'm a Jolie fan, so I want to offer here a comment on her performance as Olympias (375-316 BC), wife of King Philip II of Macedonia and mother of Alexander the Great.  It's a role unique to her career--before this, Ms Jolie never played a historical personage.  She's positively captivating, the way she brings forth from the mists of time this sinister but beautiful queen who was like a razor-edged steel sword sheathed inside an exotic scabbard of precious materials and fine craftmanship.Some reviewers say her performance is ""OTT"" (over the top).  Not at all.  Ms Jolie is commanding as Olympias, but never over-acts.  Some reviewers dismiss the accent she puts on.  Well, the accent was director Stone's call.  He wanted to impress his audience that Olympias was a foreigner to Macedonia.  Often her accent is said to be ""Romanian"", which it isn't.  (I know a few Romanians; none speaks English the way Ms Jolie does in *Alexander*.)  Actually her accent is quite similiar to the one she used in *Love is All There Is* (1994), when she played Gina, an Italian girl.  I'd say it's more Hungarian than Italian.  (Probably why it's called a Romanian accent is that it reminds people of the way Bela Lugosi spoke in his role as Dracula.  OK: the historical Dracula was a prince of what is called Romania today; and to get technical, Mr. Lugosi was born in Romania; but he was Hungarian by family and his accented English is typical of Hungarians.)  For *Alexander* Ms Jolie takes Gina's (Italo-Hungarian?) accent, mellows it down (she's a grown woman now, not an excited teenager), and puts more of a trill on the R's.The historical Olympias was a princess from the borderlands of ancient northwestern Greece, a kingdom called Epirus. A district of modern NW Greece still bears that name.  The original kingdom included part of Albania.  Except for the dynasty into which Olympias was born, the people of Epirus were barbarians by the standards of Greek civilization.  In the film, Olympias is mocked as such by Philip and other Macedonian aristocrats because she came from a royal house that ruled barbarians.According to *The Encyclopedia Brittanica*, Olympias ""had a passionate and imperious nature, and she played important roles in the power struggles"".  Ms Jolie brings that nature to the screen most effectively.  About the things we see Olympias getting up to, though, there seems to be some historical inaccuracies.For example, in the film she and Alexander are shown to be present in Macedonia when Philip is assassinated (336 BC).  Supposedly mother and son were direct witnesses to the regicide.  The movie tells us Olympias was suspected--even by Alexander--of being behind the murder. But according to the *Brittanica*, Olympias withdrew with Alexander to Epirus when the polygamous Philip married a high-born Macedonian woman.  (It was by this woman that the Macedonian king had a son, Philip III, who is shown in the film as a baby at the time of Philip II's death.)  Olympias and Alexander returned from Epirus to Macedonia only after the assassination.  The *Brittanica* confirms that suspicion indeed fell upon Olympias--and upon Alexander along with her.  But no less an authority than the philosopher Aristotle, himself Alexander's tutor and a Macedonian, dismissed this suspicion as unfounded.  Philip was killed by a nobleman, Pausanias, for reasons that had nothing to do with Olympias and Alexander.Still, Olympias was hardly pure-white as the driven snow.  After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, she had Philip III, his wife, and over a hundred of their supporters assassinated.  This she did to clear the way for her grandson (also named Alexander) to assume the throne.  Olympias the assassin of a teen prince and princess, and a hundred others!  THAT should have been in the movie!  Eventually she herself was murdered by the relatives of those she had killed.I was moved by Ms Jolie's role as a mother ""who loves too much.""  Olympias, the snake-adoring sorceress who insists the son she loves too much was fathered by a god, not by the Macedonian king Philip, meshes seamlessly with the real Jolie image--the lovely yet dangerously eccentric actress of high Hollywood lineage whose son is hers not by biology but by love alone.  Another point of note is that her performance of a mature woman, old enough to have a grownup son, is a compelling foretaste of Jolie roles to come.",3,Best bad movie ever!,1122422400,"07 27,

By the end, we were both wishing he could return it.This movie is so pointless that I can't even describe the plot.  First there are a few random scenes with a young Alexander and his mother.  Then time flashes forward and Alexander is the King of Macedonia.  He fights a war and becomes a bigger king.  The war scene sucked.  There was just a bunch of dust, and everyone was wearing so much armor you couldn't tell who was who.  Not even the baddies from the goodies.  Then you think that the goodies are losing and suddenly the baddies are running away and the goodies win.  Hmm.The movie then flashes forward to when Alexander the Great is older and he's conquering China and all that.  There's a rebellion and he kills most of his army.  He gets married to a girl and rapes her on their wedding night.  He almost dies when he attacks a giant black elephant, but the men who hated him before now love him.  They take him back to Macedonia and he dies.  Fun.This movie dragged on so long it was unbearable.  I guess it's only three hours, but it felt like four, at least.  The acting sucks, and most of the ""main characters"" have about fifty lines each.  Even Alexander doesn't do much talking.  Does anyone know if Alexander the Great was actually gay?  It seems like he is b/c he keeps kissing that weird guy whose name is unpronouncaable and starts with an H.  Alexander is supposed to be a hero, but in this movie he's just an ugly loser.

That was Caeser's turning point, and another great man was born.  Alexander would emerge from Macedonia, never to return to his homeland, to conquer 90% of the known world, crush and kill all his enemies, and die at the ripe old age of 33.This movie, however, fails to deliver the most pleasing portrail of this war hero.  We see those who were supposed to be the great influences in his life, namely his mother and father.  Angelina Jolie, who is usually the lovable vamp, comes across in some odd Russian accent.  Her love for her son is obvious, but her marriage to Val Kilmer is anything but happy.  She is adament that her son will become a great man and a military leader.  His father is a drunken slob who doesn't seem to care much for him, as he is a reminder of his marriage to Angelina.  As he grows, his love of miltary grows, and he eventually leaves home to conquer the world.So why is this movie bad?  It's bad because of the jumpy, choppy editing.  We are flashing back and forth too much from his childhood to adulthood.  Many were bent out of shape about the obvious love between him and Jared Leto, but guess what?  Homosexuality was celebrated among ancient Greek culture, and is today!  It was all told in flashback, and it became just plain annoying.If you're looking for a history lesson, it's annoying because the story does not run smoothly.  And Colin Farrell?

910352,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B0009PLLN6,mrliteral,"[7, 13]","Alexander, Oliver Stone's contribution to the resurrected genre of sword-and-sandal epics, is a clear demonstration that you can make a movie that looks like it should be great and utterly fail.  This biopic of Alexander the Great flounders on almost every level and is probably most notable for making the overblown Troy seem good in comparison.Any scrutiny as to why this movie fails must begin with Colin Farrell who plays the title character.  Farrell, in the right context, is a decent enough actor, but he's out of his element here.  He is supposed to play a great leader, but is not believable in his role.  When Russell Crowe inspires his troops in Gladiator, we believe he's a good general; when Farrell does it in this movie, the only thing I'm inspired to do is eject the DVD (but somehow I resisted and stuck with the film to the end).  It is impossible to accept that this is a man who could command any real loyalty.Stone's direction is mediocre.  The battle sequences are not all that entertaining and his attempts to be ""artistic"" come off as merely pretentious.  With the sole exception of Val Kilmer, all the actors are either chewing the scenery (such as Angelina Jolie) or underdeveloped.  Unfortunately, Kilmer's decent performance is far from enough to carry this movie.At least a film like XXX - State of the Union doesn't pretend to be great, so when it fails, we're not all that disappointed.  Not so, here.  There is undoubtedly a good movie that could be made out of the life of Alexander the Great.  It hasn't arrived yet.  If it were a film of normal length, it might be worth viewing just to see how bad it is, but at three hours, it's probably better to skip it and watch another, shorter bad movie instead.

910353,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B0009PLLN6,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[31, 34]","This movie may be a failure, but as one character says of Alexander - `His failure towered over other peoples successes!'  This directors cut is actually a little shorter than the theatrical cut, and the changes are not obvious unless you do a study of the two or someone has told you what they are - but they work.  The directors cut somehow flows better than its theatrical cousin, and does not seem quite such hard work, making it worthy of re-appraisal.However, it is still overripe - the last third of the movie showing the destruction of that which Alexander loved - His horse, his best friend / lover Haphaestion, his army, his health and most of all his dream of one nation - just somehow seem at odds with the rest of the movie, and make for an unsatisfying narrative arc.  Of course, these are just the facts of history that Oliver Stone had to work with, but you can't help wondering if the rival Alexander project of Baz Luhrmann which was scrapped when Stones vision was going to reach screens first, might have been more successful - focussing as it did on just a portion of Alexander's life.  Alexander had too rich a story perhaps to fit into one movie.  The rise of Alexander has more than enough for one epic, and the fall of Alexander is a story in itself - but to fit it all into one movie smacks of the kind of desire to outdo the competition that sank Cleopatra.So what works and what doesn't.  Stone is a genius film maker, and this movie is amazingly shot and has imaginative ideas throughout.  Occasionally these are a little overbearing, such as the reverse colour used when Alexander is injured, but on the whole they succeed - the eagle flying from Alexander talking to his soldiers across the battlefield to the waiting Persians is wonderful (if somewhat poor cgi).  The device of splicing the dual narratives of Alexander's young life with his life as the general making his conquests, is ideal - a straight chronological tale would have been just too dull - especially with the later parts in India being just so depressing.  The cast is veritably star studded, in a modern way, and the supporting cast are uniformly excellent.  Angelina Jolie makes a memorable, sexy but scary Olympias making her perfect casting - except for THAT accent which was a big mistake and quickly becomes tedious.  IN fact, what was it with accents in this movie?  Farrel has an Irish accent that is impossible to hide, but does Val Kilmer have to echo it, and Jared Leto too, as if to say the ancient Greeks were actually an Irish dynasty?  The other major woman in Alexander's life is also a big success, Rosario Dawson playing the exotic barbarian woman who became his wife, but she is under utilised.  Opinions will vary as to how good Farrel was, but in spite of the accent, I think his was a great performance showing the intended emotion, vulnerability and indeed ego of the complicated young man.The music by Vangelis is a masterful piece of music - buy the album by all means - I did.

The cinematography was executed with exquisite crafting and the acting was believable and well done.The people who are complaining about the accents, would you have preferred that this movie be totally done in Greek? Or Arabic? Or Hindi?  Would most of the people who found this movie boring and badly acted in English, actually of sat through a movie with subtitles?!  I don't think so.It is a movie, a form of entertainment.  It is not a documentary, it is not meant to portray things exactly as they were, but to tell a story.  If you want the hard cold facts, go to the library.  Even then you will find people fighting over what is really the truth.One last thing... the many people who have reviewed this movie and said that it had strong, if not extreme, homosexual acts... I have to ask what movie you saw; because it certainly was not this 2-Disc set.Over all, I highly recommend this movie to those who are able to walk and chew gum at the same time.

The script has a hard time pinpointing what makes the great man tick--and it's certainly muddled when it comes to all the conspiracy theories surrounding his youth and manhood. His mother is played by Angelina Jolie as a conniving temptress with an uncanny control over snakes--a control she has over him as well, urging him to become the great leader in battles.Colin Farrell does the best he can with the florid dialog, full of pomposity and Shakespearean grandeur, but it's not a part that he really embodies with any great conviction. He does a workmanlike job but never really becomes the character. Nor is his relationship with his lover (Jared Leto) ever given more of a hint than intense glances can convey, as if Oliver Stone was reluctant to let the homophobic aspects of Alexander's life interfere with the storytelling.The battle scenes are realistic but fatiguing after awhile, following the accepted strategy of other action films by interspersing fierce battles with the quieter moments--but never too quiet since most of the dialog consists of arguments between Alexander and his army of dedicated fighters.Val Killmer gives a vigorous performance as his father Michael, almost unrecognizable in his one-eyed make-up and red beard. Anthony Hopkins serves as a one man Greek chorus, narrating the tale in the manner of a bad DVD commentary. Christopher Plummer does a nice job as Aristotle, teaching the Greek youths about their mission in life.On the plus side, the background score by Vangelis is strikingly effective, as is Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous cinematography. The look of the film is one of its strongest assets with authentic detail in costumes and settings. But the script is a yawner, going back and forth in time to fill in gaps that were intended to fill the viewer in on some missing points.

Angelina Jolie sleep walks as Alexander's snake charming mother, a heavy Val Kilmer looks like he just walked off the set of Wonderland and had makeup over his eye applied, and the only bright spot of the entire casting is the great Anthony Hopkins providing a reflective voice over throughout the film, and it's the only way you'll know what's going on in this otherwise incoherent mess.  It's hard to believe that with the talent involved in Alexander that it turned out like this.  We know that he was a legendary conquerer and strategist, but by the time the credits roll, the only question you're left asking is what's the point?

The supporting characters disliked Alexander, they hated his penchant for boys, they hated crossing Asia for him, even his wives disliked him.  I think that they missed out that Alexander, like other conquering figures in history, is a megalomaniac.  Colin was whiny and generally weak and not believable.

910368,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B0009PLLN6,Octavius,"[4, 8]","... would have been a more apt title for Stone's horrible post-modernist depiction of this historical collossus for whom no film could really devote enough time to cover all of the facets of his greatness.  This film was doomed from the start with an ill-suited director, a horrible screenplay, a poor script, senseless editing, bad casting, and mediocre acting by most of the main actors.Oliver Stone was probably the worst choice for an epic historical film as Stone's specialty lies exclusively in the relatively narrow domain of the post-1960s Americana genre.  Stone's greatest talent in direction is with themes reflecting the pop-culture and post-modernist American values found in ""Platoon"", ""JFK"", ""Nixon"", or ""Natural Born Killers"", but not historical epics such as the life and times of Alexander The Great.  Stone's closest attempt at filming a historical epic was with ""Conan The Barbarian"" and, because of his inability to competently direct such films, he was quickly reduced to a minimal role by John Milius who took full direction to save the film from certain doom.  In addition to wasting film on simply non-sequential scenes for ""Conan"", Stone actually wanted to use disco for the theme music and Milius ardently insisted on hiring Basil Poledoris to compose the memorable score.  In the case of Alexander, Stone's rather narrow direction skills led to a completely incoherent theme emphasizing on Alexander's homosexuality as being a significant factor to his greatness when it actually wasn't.  As a result, the audience is left with a long film showing Alexander as the hip post-modern psychadelic leader whose main motive for conquering the world was to overcome his insecurity of being gay and spread his gay rights agenda to a desperate and intolerant world.Stone's emphasis on Alexander's bisexual orientation was simply a wasted opportunity and an inappropriate thematic emphasis as Alexander's motives and achievements had little to do with being bisexual.  Actually, Alexander did not like sexual intercourse at all regardless of whether a man or woman was in his bed.  Stone presents Alexander as a sobbing and confused gay sentimentalist in desperate need for his mother's approval and more concerned about his uncertain relationship with Hephaestion's companioship than with conquering the world.  Although Alexander did have a troubled relationship with Olympias, he was hardly the little insecure boy always coming back to his mother as portrayed by Stone and the film wastes too much time on developing their relationship.  Alexander was all too happy to leave his overly ambitious mother behind and to never see her again after he set off to conquer Persia: their relationship was therefore moot after that point whereas Stone falsely portrays it as an ongoing issue.  This was hardly the case as Alexander was probably the most confident leader in history who knew exactly what he wanted from an early age: to be king of Greece and conquer the world!  This is why Phillip told him when he was young, ""My son, ask for yourself another kingdom for that which I leave is too small for thee!""  In contrast to Stone's distorted depiction, Alexander's motivations for conquering Persia where essentially the same as Phillips which were to, (1) keep the Greek city-states busy fighting the Persians instead of themselves or Macedonia; (2) to control the vastest economic empire in ancient history by taking its treasures and trade routes; and, (3) to take revenge on Persia for their burning of Athens a century before.  The only difference between Alexander and Phillip is that Alexander rejoiced in the thrill of battle, conquest, and exploration a lot more than Phillip's pragmatic approach to politics and diplomacy reflected by his proverbial statement, ""Treat boys with fists and men with oaths!""  Alexander was never really interested in the pragmatic administration of the State and was more than happy to squander his treasures to continue his campaigns of conquest and exploration to the end of the then known world.  Another poor depiction of Alexander by Stone is that of his relationship with Roxeanne.  Stone portrays Roxeanne as Alexander's first wife and of great importance when in fact she was his third wife and the least important of the three.  Alexander married Roxeanne for purely pragmatic reasons and took her more as a hostage than a regal spouse who was to provide an heir to rule his entire kingdom.  Alexander's military resources were being bogged down in Bactria by petty mountain tribes who were carrying out somewhat succesful guerrilla operations against Alexander's forces.  Roxeanne was the daughter of the strongest chieftain in Bactria and so he took her as a bride/hostage to assure her father's good behavior while Alexander went East to conquer India.  Alexander impregnated Roxeanne so that he could in the future establish a direct bloodline to rule that difficult province instead of relying on the whims of local chieftains who had limited alliegiance to him.  The most absurd part in the film is where Alexander is intimidated by Roxeanne and cowers before her like a little boy.  Alexander intimidated!?  I doubt he would have been considered great if that had been true as there would be nothing more disgraceful in that time for a Greek man to cower before a woman of virtually insignificant lineage and a barbarian one to boot.  Please! The film also fails to capture Alexander's genius and grandeur by including his cutting of the Gordion Knot and his crowning as pharao after his visit to Siwa. The plot and theme of this film is also further diluted by failing to develop the perspective of the Persians and Darius III.  The film essentially has no antagonists and therfore no climactic tension to hold any suspense worth speaking of.  In short, the film getting bogged down in Stone's emphasis on Alexander's sexuality completely brushed over these crucial aspects of Alexander's true character and motives as well as the environment he found himself in.  As a result, the audience is left yawning in boredom watching a sobbing and overly gay Alexander who cowered before the women in his life and went conquering the world for self-esteem and to propagate his (or rather Stone's) post-modernist liberal agenda.  It is quite unlikely that Stone's Alexander would have been able to last even a month in leading a vast army of hardened veterans with such a weak personality not to speak of 13 years.The casting was also poor in the making of this film.  Farrel simply had too little charisma and acting talent to portray Alexander as even the great Richard Burton couldn't pull it off fifty years before in Rossen's film.  In addition, Stone's pointless direction along with the already defective screenplay and defective script utterly ruined any chance for Farrel to act the part of Alexander in a convincing way.  Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer pulled it off best even though Jolie's awkward accent tended to come off more as overacting by an actress who is insecure about her role.  Rosario Dawson was also a terrible casting decision for Roxeanne as the real Roxeanne was caucasian and not black/mulato.  She was also considered to be the most beautiful woman in the world after the women in Darius' family.  Although Dawson is relatively attractive, among the many gorgeous actresses who could have played the part she is certainly not one who generally invokes the sense of being the most beautiful woman in the world by any contemporary standard.  One of the worst performances surprisingly was that of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy whose monotonous narrative cries out ""God! When will I be done with this horrible script!"" throughout the entire film.Stone limiting Alexander's campaign to just the battles of Gaugamela and Jehlum also didn't justice to the greatness of Alexander who never lost a major battle in his entire military career.  Every conqueror or general who came after him from Caesar to Schwarzkopff felt only disappointment at not being able to come even close to his military greatness.  The battle of Gaugamela is abruptly introduced without showing how Alexander got there after brilliantly defeating Persia at Granicus or Issus.  The film simply shifts from Ptolemy's boring narrative to a bird's eye view of the battle field that illuminates nothing as to Alexander's courage and brilliant tactics. The scenes are nothing but senseless phallanx and cavalry deployments giving the audience no idea as to what is happening on the battle field or what Alexander really did to win the battle.  The depiction of Jehlum was even worse as the battle did not take place in a dense jungle but in a large clearing in the semi arid region of the Indus valley in modern-day Pakistan.  A phallanx formation and cavalry tactics would have been utterly useless in a dense jungle environment and any army using such tactics against Porus' elephants and nimble infantry would have been completely crushed.  As with Gaugamela, what won the battle of Jehlum was Alexander's brilliant use of cavalry outmaneuver Porus' elephants and infantry.  Furthermore, Alexander was not pierce by an arrow in that battle nor did he lose his prized horse Baucephalus: both these events had already taken place previously before he advanced into India.  Stone fails to depict Alexander's brilliant victories and Granicus and Issus and no film has bothered to show his siege of Tyre where he sacked the island citadel with two 3/4 mile jettis that his men built in less than 6 months by sheer herculean effort. The film also falsely portrays Alexander as receiving Darius family for the first time in Babylon when he had actually taken them hostage after the battle of Issus.This was simply a terrible depiction of Alexander The Great's life in which Stone wasted the entire theme and plot to show how Alexander being gay as a significant factor to his greatness when it wasn't.  Alexander's youthful energy, godlike self-confidence, and sheer military genius were the main factors contributing to his greatness and not his homosexuality.  That is why Alexander is called ""The Great"" and not ""The Gay.""  In truth, I don't think any film medium short of an extended miniseries to the likes of HBO's ""Rome"" would do justice to the complexities of Alexander's character or the impact he actually made on Western civilization and the rest of the world.  To paraphrase Phillip's advice to Alexander, I would tell the audience to go and seek a better film of Alexander for that which Rossen and Stone have left is too mediocre to watch.",1,Alexander The

Alexander has a tendency to slip between horrible acting and grandeur epic battle scenes, to create an overall big budget mainstream movie with some low budget production values that should not be there. Still though, we get lots of Greek philosophy, pre-Christian bisexuality and the psychological infant and early adult Oedipus complex. It is all about chasing ideas, shaping our destinies and where the future may take us. Alexander's father, Philip, (Val Kilmer) is a stone cold warrior with no love. His mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie) is a manipulative power-hungry vixen. His love for both his parents plus his dreams turns him into a stone cold manipulative power-hungry day dreaming warrior who tries to conquer any kingdom that he can think off... and succeeds... for most of it. The power plays are quite interesting, including scenes where the son Alexander disobeys his father and almost creates an international incident because of it. There are those who want to share in Alexander's dreams, and even warriors who want to share his bed, creating an interesting complex story with people trying to reflect each other's qualities. However in directing a film more about Alexander the person than Alexander the Great, we get into trouble a bit because the acting is sketchy, even at the best of times. Performances let it down more than a tad.The battle scenes are quite bloody with lots of CGI. Again this is certainly not the worst historical battler that you can see but it doesn't really turn out to be such a good one either. Some very nice production design values seem to save it from direct to video hell though. Interesting movie, grand in many parts, but like we said there are more than a few low budget production values that creep in where they should not.",3,Omegas not so mega,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,1998,"['reason', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'see', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'much', 'reason', 'put', 'backburner', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'director', 'lead', 'star', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'first', 'Alexander', 'tendency', 'slip', 'horrible', 'acting', 'grandeur', 'epic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'create', 'overall', 'big', 'budget', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'values', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'there', 'Still', 'get', 'lots', 'Greek', 'philosophy', 'pre-Christian', 'bisexuality', 'psychological', 'infant', 'early', 'adult', 'Oedipus', 'complex', 'chasing', 'ideas', 'shaping', 'destinies', 'where', 'future', 'may', 'take', 'Alexander', 'father', 'Philip', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'stone', 'cold', 'warrior', 'love', 'mother', 'Olympias', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'manipulative', 'power-hungry', 'vixen', 'love', 'parents', 'dreams', 'stone', 'cold', 'manipulative', 'power-hungry', 'day', 'dreaming', 'warrior', 'who', 'conquer', 'kingdom', 'can', 'think', 'off', 'most', 'power', 'plays', 'are', 'quite', 'interesting', 'including', 'scenes', 'where', 'son', 'Alexander', 'father', 'almost', 'international', 'incident', 'are', 'who', 'want', 'share', 'Alexander', 'dreams', 'even', 'warriors', 'who', 'want', 'share', 'bed', 'creating', 'interesting', 'complex', 'story', 'people', 'trying', 'reflect', 'other', 'qualities', 'However', 'directing', 'film', 'more', 'Alexander', 'person', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'get', 'trouble', 'bit', 'acting', 'sketchy', 'even', 'best', 'times', 'Performances', 'let', 'down', 'more', 'tad.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'bloody', 'lots', 'CGI', 'Again', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst', 'historical', 'battler', 'can', 'see', ""n't"", 'really', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'such', 'good', 'one', 'either', 'very', 'nice', 'production', 'design', 'values', 'seem', 'save', 'direct', 'video', 'hell', 'Interesting', 'movie', 'grand', 'many', 'parts', 'said', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'values', 'creep', 'where', 'should', 'not']",Alexander

Normally, I wouldn't have minded the length of the movies.  I sat through Kingdom of Heaven and King Kong.  Time passed quickly but towards the third quarter of Alexander, my concentration started to give way.  I couldn't help but noticing Irish, English, Russian accents spoken as Macedonians.  The battles meant to be the highlight for movies of such proportions but it wasn't executed as successfully as in Kingdom of Heavens and even Troy!  Utlimately, it came to the direction of the movie.  I guess that the planning and execution of it wasn't tackled until the movie started.  Throughout the movie, Alexander tended to fight against his inner demons (with much manipulation by his mother, Olympia versus his father).  I tried to feel for Alexander, the flawed conqueror and yet, I couldn't.  The battles were many and emphasis was never made to let us relate between Alexander and his generals.  Oliver Stone the director painted them as racists and ignorant mercenaries who would fight one another the moment Alexander died.  The only bit that touched my heart would be that insignificant moment between Alexander and his favourite horse which was actually registered in history, the very horse that fought with him all the way to history.  The last quarter was the hardest bit to swallow with arty farty red against white background and pscyhedellic images to the point that it felt out of character with the rest of the movie.  There was much said about emphasis on Alexander's love for his male lover (Jared Leto) here that it 'killed' the movie.  However, the latest offering of Brokeback Mountain doesn't seem to have that problem.  The reality of the matter is Alexander is a commendable and valiant effort but pitching that against superior offering by Ridley Scott, it's simply a good but forgettable movie whilst Kingdom of Heaven seemed to be a well planned and executed balanced movie which would be seen as a standard for the Crusades theme in the forseeable future.

His ""stirring"" speeches to his troops aren't all that stirring.Mel Gibson (Braveheart) he ain't. I wouldn't follow this guy to the state line, let alone to the ends of the Earth. Stone replaces good acting with drawn out shots of Ferrell's face or soulfull dark eyes. It doesn't work. Ferrell may not deserve all the blame, he didn't have all that great a script to work with.Angelina Jolie could have phoned this one in.she is down right laughable as Alexander's mom, Olympias.Her acting is limited to squinting and hissing her lines. She really had no clue where to go with this part. There is no evidence of any real affection for her son.Her accent( what I would call ancient Vampira) is awful. Has the woman ever actually heard a Greek accent?Jared Leto as Hepaistion is vapid at best. Lets leave it at that.I was never able to really connect with any character. You simply do not give a darn what happens to these people. That may well be the films greatest weakness. The depth of the relationship with Hephaistion is never truly explored. The -were they or were they not- aside, an incredible bond of friendship existed between these two men. Historical sources tell us that after Hephaistion's death, Alexander locked himself away and mourned without food and water for many days.He began to decline, and never recovered. This film does not show that kind of passionate devotion.

Choose a king, or a tyrant, and be prepared to show him as both beloved of the people, and disliked for his mistakes, usually the mistakes that come from the Shakespearian tragic hero conceit of having too much pride (hubris) or being too driven on a certain goal that he neglects other important aspects of rulership.Secondly, you need beautiful people to fill predominant roles.  Choose someone like Colin Farrell, since he's popular, and Angelina Jolie for a seductress.  Choose Jared Leto to be a pretty boy and Rosario Dawson for the historical character's wife.  Then fill all of the extras and back-up roles with ugly fat men and maybe the occassional ethnic woman or two.About the dialog, there are three types: first... there's the dramatic whisper...which you put pauses in between each clause... and then inflex the voice down at the end; secondlythere'sthesomewhatloudbutfastpacedmediumdialog that ends with each word carefully accented; THIRDLY EVERYONE MUST YELL AT EACHOTHER IMPORTANTLY!  Important scenes should contain transitions between all three types.No epic feature should ever be less than 2 hours and 15 minutes long.  Include long marches and sand-and-sandal imagery.  Have slow, whispery dialog speeches that last ten minutes.  Include epic battle scenes that contain about a thousand aerial shots of armies clashing cross-cut with close-ups of people screaming with the occassional sudden cut of two bodies running into each other and falling down.And the most important thing you need to do to make a typical epic feature: at any point it seems the story might be able to end, make something happen just to make quite clear to the audience that the end is never, ever coming.Those are the rules Oliver Stone adhered to in order to put some meat, so to speak, on his analysis of the conquerer Alexander the Great.  I can see what he wanted to do... too bad he left all the important stuff to a five minute battle about two and half hours into the film.  The rest of it was just kind of filler space,  with the only seemingly inherent interest being the homosexuality.

Angelina Jolie is very good at playing herself but the Soviet accent is grating. The few battle scenes are mere sideshows between Alexander ogling one or another of his generals. The Macedonian kings (Philip and Alexander both) prefer to rape their women. There is no intelligible storyline and there are way too many men wearing eyeshadow and mascara; all the women have pouting lips - the Botox fad in full bloom. And, blimey, what's with the Irish accents? Hollywood has got cinematography, lighting and costumes down pat, but much more is expected. The most pathetic aspect of this curvaceous mess is why Oliver Stone keeps getting these budgets to purposely fake history and why some insist on revising said history as if everybody is way too stupid to notice. Shootout on the Titanic? Why not. Who's gonna tell on us? Did Alexander really bed his generals? Inquiring minds want to know...Actually, they're all so cute, even Casanova might stray. There are more than a handful of statues with projecting specimens, some artfully framed below the neck and above the ankles, and one man gives another a gorgeous ring (eat your heart out, Kate Middleton!) so all the bases seem covered. Why, even Alexander's jewels are quickly visible - from behind, no less - in one prelude with a Greek (actually Babylonian) Kouros. The music, too, is sensitive - inappropriate, but caring. No 24 year old women could possibly be made nervous by any of this. (but clearly even Hollywood can't pull the cash unless they get repeat attendance by that most diabolical segment of the population - men! Wonder why they never went back?) The thought that hundreds of people spent time preparing and post-producing this is why paying for a legitimate copy of this movie is depressing - do we really want those people gainfully employed in doing this?

910389,A43ZLPILETJHV,B0009PLLN6,Raymond F. Gillis,"[206, 219]","Oliver Stone's Alexander Revisited is now something of a masterwork. He is given the chance to tell the story as he would have originally liked to have presented it. The 45 minutes of extra's are true extra's...spread out in short 2 to 5 second edits...to more lengthly exchanges that happily include Brian Blessed as the Physical Instructor, Christopher Plummer as Aristotle and quite a bit more voice over and character addition from Anthony Hopkins as the aged Ptolemy.The action starts almost immediately with a longer, more graphic version of the Battle of Gaugemela (Wonderfully undertaken, Stone paying homage to the great Sergei Bondarchuk with those terrific panning shots) and then works backwards through Alexanders youth. The film moves forward and backwards from there yet the new subtitles give you the year and how long, before or after, from the previous scene. It is quite instructive to anyone the slighest bit confused and is a superb history lesson. Also good are longer dancing scenes with Roxanna's troupe and Bogoas' troupe...both superb, filmic scenes...beautifully done. The Bogoas character (Francisco Bosch) is also expanded and made far more sympathetic.The Indian Battle (wonderfully filmed in Thailand) is also more graphic as are some of the more intimate scenes yet nothing is without merit. This is not 2007, it's 330BC and mores and the concept of battle, honor, fidelity etc were different for those times. I for one, praise Mr. Stone for a very accurate feel and presence...and even minor characters are explained in far greater detail...such as the young Guardsman who killed Philip (Kilmer)...in a flashback we see his motives.

His second ""restructuring"" of his 2004 film is much better than the previous two, even with the additional footage.  Stone has crafted a film that is both contemporary as well as traditional as it tells the tale of one of the greatest conquerors in world history.  Perhaps, it is better viewed at home, allowing the viewer to savor the cinematography, the opulent sets, the well-choreographed battle scenes, the magnificent costumes, and the acting, a combination of the over-the-top and the subdued.Speaking of the acting, many have been critical of Colin Farrell in the title role.  The ""revisitation"" puts his performance in a better balance, permitting one to view his empassioned acting in a different perspective.  Many it's not Oscar-worthy but his take on the historical character is pretty darn good.  He is matched by Angelina Jolie as his mother, Omega, in a most interesting interpretation which must be respected for its uniqueness.  Other outstanding acting turns are given by Rosario Dawson as Alexander's wife, Roxane, Gary Stretch as Clietus, Val Kilmer as Phillip, Christopher Plummer as Aristotle, Jared Leto as Hephaistio, and Conner Paolo as the young Alexander.The jaw-dropping special effects, especially the re-enactment of the historical battles are stunning.

It was astoundingly well-done, magnificently directed, and Colin Farrell should have been up for a best actor nomination.  As far as the director's cut goes, I would have kept everything in the first film, plus adding on the extras. If anything, I intensely disliked the Bagoas episodes, which to me were far beneath Alexander's character, and a diminishment of his relationship with Hephaistion... which I would have preferred to see more of.  The additional footage between Alexander and Olympias, just after Philip's assassination, was a big boost to the film -- really adding a more conflicted dimension to their relationship, which seemed justified.  I would like also to have seen more of Darius, and his position... as it stands, one can't consider someone known as the Great King being so easily dethroned, and with such simplicity.  Of course, I guess I'm asking for two more hours of film.  However, if they were as good as the rest, I'd be happy to see it.  No sense to run on and on.

Any movie I've seen have the same type of problems.  It would be difficult to show even a year of Alexander's reign in three hours much less an overview of his life (and this is what the movie is...an overview from Oliver Stone's perspective).That much said, if this would have been the cut released to the theaters, the movie probably would not have been a flop in the US.  It is much more linear (still some flashbacks).  Colin's whining doesn't seem to be so dramatic in this cut, and Jolie's accent seems not so extreme.  The narration of Ptolomy also seems to make a bit more sense.To be honest, if this cut would have been the theatrical release, the movie probably would have won the Oscar for Best Picture.For the detractors, watch this version.

Though is certainly has its weak points, this is an entertaining and well-done movie about one of history's most fascinating characters, Alexander the Great.First, the good stuff.  The film is lavishly shot, with beautiful recreations of Babylon and Alexandria, Egypt.  It appears many of the scenes were shot on location.  The battle scenes are much better than some reviewers suggest.  The reason that the battle at Issis is confusing is that it was fought in the desert and the dust that was kicked up turned visibility to near-zero.  The other battle scenes are extremely good.  The film is generally historically accurate, at least for Hollywood standards.The negatives?  Poor acting by all involved.  Colin Farrel does not cut it as Alexander, though he has moments of excellence, such as Alexander's speech to his revolting army in India.  Angelina Jolie is awful as Olympias, Alexander's conniving mother.  Val Kilmer's Phillip is also over-the-top and ends up being a caricature that fails to address Phillip's complexity as a human being.  The bisexual love interests of Alexander are covered so delicately at times that it appears Stone was aware that too much overt sexuality would destroy the film at the box office.  At other times, Stone seems to forget this and several scenes are downright disturbing, although to be fair, at least these are probably accurate.For sweep, grandeur, and an overall picture of the life of a complex and amazing man, this is a good film.  Not great, but certainly good and a cut above most of the garbage Hollywood puts out any more.  I applaud Oliver Stone for making the effort to make a truly epic movie about a historical figure.  Compare this film to crap like 'Forty-Year Old Virgin' or 'Knocked Up', which got generally good reviews, and maybe it's the reviewers who messed up, not 'Alexander'.It is certainly worth picking up for the low price it has plunged to.

910399,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B0009PLLN6,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[1, 3]","the movie asks a number of serious questions about the nature of leadership.What makes a man like Alexander? What drives him? Why do men follow him?It offers several potential answers.He listened to the stories and believed in his own destiny and greatness.He was driven to succeed, to rule, to conquer.He was lucky, surrounded by good men, who fought hard, bravely and loyally for him.It talks about vision, his vision of a unified world, with great cities of Alexander like jewels in a crown, the centerpieces of a new kind of world.It talks about heroics, and stupidity and drunkeness. Loss and long standing love, a manipulating yet wise mother, a loving yet distant father. All the elements that go into the creation of a man and later elaborated into stories and new mythos used to shape the following generations.It is interesting to have the format of the story-line being the memories of an old man, about his younger days and the things he did and saw 40 years before.It consists of flashbacks and a roughly chronologically strung together narrative about how Alexander became Alexander the Great.As an old man, he has seen the consequences of these actions that he narrates, With this advantage point of time, we are afforded more than a chronicle of battles and journeys, we are given the events partly digested and interpreted. What it means to die without an heir apparent, what the drunken rage really costs, why luxury eats at the soul of warriors. Why the men didn't share his vision and how that allows the empire to disintegrate immediately after his death.It is these kinds of big themes that make movies and books about amazing men like Alexander so interesting and thought provoking. The movie with it's extraordinary battle scenes supplies something more than what a text can do. It gives this emotional umph, this feeling that you somehow share in the adventures, that it is more than imaginative projection, it is a shared experience. And the movie achieves much of this by it's simply overwhelming scale. I could and have read about the battle of Gaugamela, but the movie makes it real in a way that my imagination in reading a book is deficient, for that i am grateful to Stone for the visuals and the historicity of his scenes.But the movie leaves me with an overwhelming sadness for all those that seem to have to die for a great man's vision. What is it about people that make the glory and carnage on a battlefield so allurging that movies can be made 2 millennium later? What don't prophets or merchants or diplomats cause our blood to run hot and for us to jump into the gap? Why is it that war unites people in destruction and bloodletting? Certainly it can lead to empire, to greater things than tribalism and unending petty border skirmishes, but so can other ways of unifying people behind a complex and significant vision of the ways things ought to be. Why is it that there seems to be no alternatives to men such as Alexander, or Genghis Khan, or Mohammed or even Stalin and Mao and Hitler in the 20thC.

910401,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B0009PLLN6,Robert Blake,"[2, 2]","Oliver Stone was not kidding when he mentioned that Alexander The Great's life might be too complicated for dramatization, which explains why it has taken the controversial director three seperate cuts to finally settle on a version of his ""Alexander"" that he claims he's comfortable with. ""Alexander"" still stands as one of the most curious flops of recent years. Its release was preceded by a whole year of hype and anticipation as Stone, the director of brilliant, engaging films like ""JFK"" and ""Platoon,"" was setting his sights on ancient history, many suspected his decision to tackle Alexander's life and invasion of the East as a sort of statement on Bush's current campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The production itself was an epic struggle, just read historian Robin Lane Fox's book ""The Making Of Alexander"" (Fox was also the film's historical consultant). When the film premiered in November 2004, it was immediately bashed and ridiculed as a bizarre, muddled homoerotic swords and sandles flick (although it was a hit overseas). Now after two DVD releases, including a Director's Cut that was shorter than the original, comes ""Alexander Revisited,"" which is Stone's attempt at taking the movie and molding it into something more akin to the grand epics of old Hollywood, with modern sex and gore. The result is indeed a more focused, less confusing storyline on a grander scale. Stone has literally re-edited the movie, different takes are used, and certain scenes mixed around. Shots of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy speaking that were originally at the end of the movie are now at the beginning, and this time the movie skips over Alexander's youth at the beginning and uses the epic battle of Gaugamela as a springboard into the character's life. Some expanded material is a lot of fun to watch, especially the scene where Alexander (Colin Farrell) first sees the Bactrian princess Roxane (Rosario Dawson) dancing during a feast, here the scene is longer, with some great choreography. And yes, there is more sex and violence. The battle scenes include some wicked moments of gore, consider the battle in India where now we have a shot of an elephant's foot crashing down on a doomed Greek skull. Alexander's homosexual side is more evident here as well with new material between him and the Persian eunuch Bogoas. The film does still have some merits, especially the beautiful cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (Babel, Frida), the music by Vangelis (Blade Runner), and some stunning production design and costume design credits. But no matter how much Stone slices and dices his movie, there some problems editing simply cannot fix, like performances. Colin Farrell is simply a bad Alexander, he does not have the drive, the brilliant madness, or captivating air for a Greek philosopher king who conquered the known world and spread Hellenism, and his balance of Alexander's strong warrior angle with his more tender, feminine character is unbalanced and makes for a performance that is sometimes puzzling, most times weird. Angelina Jolie is a good Olympias, she manages to bring fierce energy to her scenes with Farrell while Val Kilmer does a great King Philip (Alexander's father), Anthony Hopkins as always is notable eventhough he just walks around and narrates. But the movie still suffers from a confusion of what it wants to say, or WHAT it wants to say. Most of the story is still told through voice-over work, and we never get a good look or sense of what exactly Alexander was doing or achieving as he raided all these countries. We know he spread Hellenism and Greek culture, because we read it during history class in high school, but Stone never SHOWS it, instead we get scenes of argument and dialogue that can lead nowhere. The movie can chug along at moments, and great characters like Roxane are wasted and never used as they should. Jared Leto is also a terrible Hephaiston and his over-done use of eye-liner is peculiar. In the end, ""Alexander Revisited"" is an interesting study in the re-editing and assembly of a feature film, but it also shows that there are certain things you simply cannot fix in the editing lab.",3,"The Final Take Of A Movie With Some Merits, And Some Flaws.",1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,4153,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'was', 'not', 'kidding', 'when', 'mentioned', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'complicated', 'dramatization', 'why', 'taken', 'controversial', 'director', 'three', 'seperate', 'cuts', 'finally', 'settle', 'version', 'Alexander', 'comfortable', 'Alexander', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'curious', 'flops', 'recent', 'years', 'release', 'was', 'preceded', 'whole', 'year', 'hype', 'anticipation', 'Stone', 'director', 'brilliant', 'engaging', 'films', 'JFK', 'Platoon', 'was', 'setting', 'sights', 'ancient', 'history', 'many', 'suspected', 'decision', 'tackle', 'Alexander', 'life', 'invasion', 'East', 'sort', 'statement', 'Bush', 'current', 'campaigns', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'production', 'was', 'epic', 'struggle', 'just', 'read', 'historian', 'Robin', 'Lane', 'Fox', 'book', 'Making', 'Alexander', 'Fox', 'was', 'also', 'film', 'historical', 'consultant', 'When', 'film', 'premiered', 'November', '2004', 'was', 'immediately', 'bashed', 'ridiculed', 'bizarre', 'muddled', 'homoerotic', 'swords', 'sandles', 'flick', 'was', 'hit', 'overseas', 'Now', 'two', 'DVD', 'releases', 'including', 'Director', 'Cut', 'was', 'shorter', 'original', 'Alexander', 'Revisited', 'Stone', 'attempt', 'taking', 'movie', 'molding', 'something', 'more', 'akin', 'grand', 'epics', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'modern', 'sex', 'gore', 'result', 'indeed', 'more', 'focused', 'less', 'confusing', 'storyline', 'grander', 'scale', 'Stone', 'literally', 're-edited', 'movie', 'different', 'are', 'used', 'certain', 'scenes', 'mixed', 'around', 'Shots', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ptolemy', 'speaking', 'were', 'originally', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'now', 'beginning', 'time', 'movie', 'Alexander', 'youth', 'beginning', 'epic', 'battle', 'Gaugamela', 'springboard', 'character', 'life', 'expanded', 'material', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'Alexander', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'first', 'Bactrian', 'princess', 'Roxane', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'dancing', 'feast', 'here', 'scene', 'longer', 'great', 'choreography', 'yes', 'more', 'sex', 'violence', 'battle', 'scenes', 'include', 'wicked', 'moments', 'gore', 'consider', 'battle', 'India', 'where', 'now', 'have', 'shot', 'elephant', 'foot', 'crashing', 'down', 'doomed', 'Greek', 'skull', 'Alexander', 'homosexual', 'side', 'more', 'evident', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'material', 'Persian', 'eunuch', 'Bogoas', 'film', 'still', 'have', 'merits', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'Babel', 'Frida', 'music', 'Vangelis', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'stunning', 'production', 'design', 'costume', 'design', 'credits', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'Stone', 'slices', 'movie', 'problems', 'editing', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'fix', 'performances', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'simply', 'bad', 'Alexander', 'not', 'have', 'drive', 'brilliant', 'madness', 'captivating', 'air', 'Greek', 'philosopher', 'king', 'who', 'conquered', 'known', 'world', 'spread', 'Hellenism', 'balance', 'Alexander', 'strong', 'warrior', 'angle', 'more', 'tender', 'feminine', 'character', 'unbalanced', 'performance', 'sometimes', 'puzzling', 'most', 'times', 'weird', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'good', 'Olympias', 'bring', 'fierce', 'energy', 'scenes', 'Farrell', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'great', 'King', 'Philip', 'Alexander', 'father', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'always', 'notable', 'just', 'walks', 'around', 'narrates', 'movie', 'still', 'confusion', 'what', 'say', 'WHAT', 'say', 'Most', 'story', 'still', 'told', 'voice-over', 'work', 'never', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'sense', 'what', 'exactly', 'Alexander', 'was', 'doing', 'achieving', 'raided', 'countries', 'know', 'spread', 'Hellenism', 'Greek', 'culture', 'read', 'history', 'class', 'high', 'school', 'Stone', 'never', 'instead', 'get', 'scenes', 'argument', 'dialogue', 'can', 'lead', 'nowhere', 'movie', 'can', 'chug', 'along', 'moments', 'great', 'characters', 'Roxane', 'are', 'wasted', 'never', 'used', 'should', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'also', 'terrible', 'Hephaiston', 'over-done', 'use', 'eye-liner', 'peculiar', 'end', 'Alexander', 'Revisited', 'interesting', 'study', 're-editing', 'assembly', 'feature', 'film', 'also', 'are', 'certain', 'things', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'fix', 'editing', 'lab']",Alexander

910403,A28OPE2MXDLWHK,B0009PLLN6,Rob,"[3, 4]","I was almost expecting to be disappointed by this movie because of all the critic bashing of it I'd seen.  This is a good movie with many memorable scenes.  I believe the director's cut also flows better than I believe the original version did.  The DC version first establishes Alexander as the man he was - conqueror, leader, inspirer of men, strong willed.....and then, reverts back to him as a young man before his father was assasinated.  I must say, some of the bad reviews on I've seen here seem downright juvenille.  It's okay not to like a movie and say why but to resort to some of the things I've seen makesme doubt the validity of the message itself.Anyway, Colin Ferrell did a good job........maybe a bit of overacting here and there.  And I can see where some critics say he came off as a 'crybaby'.....but that was maybe just one small scene.  All in all his acting is passionate and he projects the leadership and drive the real man must have had.  The battle of Galgamela.....awesome and worth the price of admission.  Other telling and memorable scenes were - Alexander showing all he could ride the horse Bucephalus....Phillip taking his son on a tour of the cave to recount the history of the titans and gods.  The wedding celebration where Alexander is insulted by a guest and then berated by his father.  The battle in India.......all great scenes and well done by Mr. Stone.  Some themes in the movie were a bit overdone I thought...sexuality here and there....and perhaps his mother like snakes a bit too much.....but this is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.  All in all  a good movie which closely parallels his real life.  Powerful scenes that are well complimented by Vangelis' musical score.  Worth the time to watch and if you don't know anything about Alexander, you may be saying as my wife did as we watched the battle where Alexander drove Darius from the battlefield.....""

910404,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B0009PLLN6,Robin Simmons,"[13, 16]","ALEXANDER DIRECTOR'S CUT (Warner) is Oliver Stone's ""re-configuration"" (his words) of his sweeping bio-epic of the world's greatest warrior-conqueror and, apparently, bisexual.The original $140 million (not counting advertising) theatrical release was reviled by critics and shunned by audiences, earning a paltry $30 some million in the U.S.After a decades long fascination with Alexander the Great, Stone was shocked and humiliated at the public reaction and immediately started re-imagining his film for the digital edition.  Stone cut nearly 20 minutes from the theatrical release and added about ten minutes of unseen footage.  Hundreds of additional edits dramatically reshaped dozens of sequences.  In addition, he removed a significant and controversial homo-erotic love scene between Alexander (Colin Farrell) and his male lover. What was originally mocked as ""Alexander the Gay"" is now less so.Compared to the theatrical release, Stone's ""Director's Cut"" is a misnomer.  After all, the first release was also his cut.  However, this DVD is a different film; better because it is more accessible.  The action has been beefed up and the once confusing narrative is easier to follow.  And the already magnificent score by Vangelis seems somehow more effective on this new cut.Stone is a bold, inventive, visionary director who takes chances with controversial material.  However, his attempt to get under the skin (no pun intended) and create a psychological and emotional portrait of this extraordinary historical figure who conquered the known world by the age of 33 over two millennia ago has not been fully realized.But make no mistake, in the midst of awesome images of breathtaking scope, savage violence, and revealing intimacy there are also unexpected moments of insight into a puzzling, complex and paradoxical character.  I'm referring to both Alexander and Stone himself.Stone's dense commentary on this cut is way above the norm, with tons of historical information as well as personal observations.  But the secret thing that drove Alexander -- and why the director's obsession with him -- are still a mystery.  The second disc's feature length documentary on the film's production by Sean Stone (Oliver's son) are nicely done, refreshingly raw and unpretentious.Who knows, maybe this is only a work-in-progress that will eventuall undergo more changes and, like a great artist painting over a flawed canvas, Stone will eventually reveal the masterpiece that lurks beneath the surface of what is probably the most expensive vanity production of all time.",3,DIRECTOR'S CUT IS BETTER THAN THEATRICAL,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,2575,"['ALEXANDER', 'DIRECTOR', 'CUT', 'Warner', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 're-configuration', 'words', 'sweeping', 'bio-epic', 'world', 'greatest', 'warrior-conqueror', 'apparently', 'bisexual.The', 'original', '140', 'million', 'not', 'counting', 'advertising', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'reviled', 'critics', 'shunned', 'audiences', 'earning', 'paltry', '30', 'million', 'U.S.After', 'decades', 'long', 'fascination', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'Stone', 'was', 'shocked', 'humiliated', 'public', 'reaction', 'immediately', 'started', 're-imagining', 'film', 'digital', 'edition', 'Stone', 'cut', 'nearly', '20', 'minutes', 'theatrical', 'release', 'added', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'unseen', 'footage', 'Hundreds', 'additional', 'edits', 'dramatically', 'reshaped', 'dozens', 'sequences', 'addition', 'removed', 'significant', 'controversial', 'homo-erotic', 'love', 'scene', 'Alexander', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'male', 'lover', 'What', 'was', 'originally', 'mocked', 'Alexander', 'Gay', 'now', 'less', 'so.Compared', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Stone', 'Director', 'Cut', 'misnomer', 'first', 'release', 'was', 'also', 'cut', 'However', 'DVD', 'different', 'film', 'better', 'more', 'accessible', 'action', 'been', 'beefed', 'up', 'once', 'confusing', 'narrative', 'easier', 'follow', 'already', 'magnificent', 'score', 'Vangelis', 'somehow', 'more', 'effective', 'new', 'cut.Stone', 'bold', 'inventive', 'visionary', 'director', 'who', 'chances', 'controversial', 'material', 'However', 'attempt', 'get', 'skin', 'pun', 'intended', 'create', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'portrait', 'extraordinary', 'historical', 'figure', 'who', 'conquered', 'known', 'world', 'age', '33', 'two', 'millennia', 'ago', 'not', 'been', 'fully', 'realized.But', 'make', 'mistake', 'midst', 'awesome', 'images', 'breathtaking', 'scope', 'savage', 'violence', 'revealing', 'intimacy', 'are', 'also', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'insight', 'puzzling', 'complex', 'paradoxical', 'character', ""'m"", 'referring', 'Alexander', 'Stone', 'himself.Stone', 'dense', 'commentary', 'cut', 'way', 'norm', 'tons', 'historical', 'information', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'observations', 'secret', 'thing', 'drove', 'Alexander', 'why', 'director', 'obsession', 'are', 'still', 'mystery', 'second', 'disc', 'feature', 'length', 'documentary', 'film', 'production', 'Sean', 'Stone', 'Oliver', 'son', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'refreshingly', 'raw', 'unpretentious.Who', 'knows', 'maybe', 'only', 'work-in-progress', 'will', 'eventuall', 'undergo', 'more', 'changes', 'great', 'artist', 'painting', 'flawed', 'canvas', 'Stone', 'will', 'eventually', 'reveal', 'masterpiece', 'surface', 'what', 'probably', 'most', 'expensive', 'vanity', 'production', 'time']",Alexander
910405,AK1OBVI54SY73,B0009PLLN6,"Rocky ""Raquel""","[6, 9]","Okay I love historic films and watch most of the ones that have ever come out. Alexander was one of them so I rented the film out. Three hours I thought, well let's hope it's an exciting three hours! Because there have been historic films that were exciting, and the hours did just whiz by. Yet this film dragged...and dragged. Whoever directed this movie didn't get the whole point of Alexander. Alexander was one of the most exiciting men to ever live, or so it was in written texts. Now I don't know how he truly was, but written wise he did not sit around whining about how his drunken father and controlling mother hated him for at least one whole hour of the film. I wanted to see him away from home, I wanted to see him travel and I wanted him to fight his battles. That is the whole excitement of a historic film correct?You hardly get this. The battles are mainly cut short so he can continue to look back and see how his mother and father scarred him for life basically and so he can continue to weep and supposedly be torn over his bisexuality. It was all right if once or twice they hinted at this, but they continued to push and push the gay card and it got annoying. Yes, we get it, he and his companion were close, I don't know how close exactly, and could have cared less. But I wish they would have given his wife a little more strength in the film, even if he was gay and liked his companion more, his wife was still very important you know. They gave his mother more strength which kind of makes Alexander seem like a mama's boy and weakens the character ever more. They made Alexander seem more like a lover than a warrior, and that cuts me off the film because my god, everyone makes him as a great warrior and this movie well softened him. A lot. I didn't see him as no warrior in this film.What should they have done? Well in my opinion, more battle scenes, less mother scenes (she can really get on your nerves), more wife scenes, less flash back scenes, and more, definitely more scenes where Alexander shows his true self, the selfish and anger- ridden warrior that was known and how the others contended with it. They only showed the true Alexander once and awhile and it made no sense. You cannot change from angry warrior to a soft- ridden poet who only wants to be loved. And I think others agree we wanted to see the warrior instead, or at least a lot more than we did.This movie is disappointing, one of the weakest historic films I have seen and also one of the most boring. The movie probably would have been better if they cut back a lot of the scenes unnecessary and made the film shorter and more to the point. They didn't though, so thus they lose major points to me.

910407,AKELS44ECAVEB,B0009PLLN6,"Rogue Fox ""Rogue""","[5, 9]","I've seen this movie awhile ago and must say that I was greatly dissapointing in my opinion when I watched it. The movie in my opinion was just plainly bland and rushed; with nothing much to savor. The movie did depict Alexander's life, showing that he was not perfect and gave information about his life. Though, I think they should have showed more of the conquest part, with only two epic battles; one at the begging of the movie against the mighty Persians, and one towards the end the bloody battle in the forests of India. Both of the battles though were shown in great detail, and were fun to watch. The movie did depict the hardship of the soldiers during the campaign, and showed hoe Alexander turned from a great leader into a self centering delusional person.The movie moved slower than I liked; and was mainly created for a History buff that knows a lot about this stuff. I myself love history, but let me tell you there is so much this movie failed to capture in my opinion. Anyways, like I said in the title this is kind of like a documentary you would usually see on the History Channel. The movie plainly went no where no where with the constant flash backs, and point where you when it seem that the movie would just take a nose drive. In, my opinion making the Director's Cut version made no actual difference, and couldn't seem to save this film. The movie is still respectable and very complex and detailed.I never really did get..... Why the heck Angelina Jolee played as Olympias (Alexander's Mother),.... I know this probably doesn't matter but really she had to be using about 5-6 different accents, I know since I speak a few different languages. It is just odd for Angelia Jolee to actually be Colin Farell's (Alexander) mother. They should have gotten someone older and more mature to play Olympias. Yes, Angelina Jolee is very sexy, but really why is she playing the part of Olympias, just stick with Tomb Raider. Colin Farrel did do a good job playing Alexander. I'm not sure he was maybe the best choice for the part but he delivered. (note:The real Alexander had Green Eyes Not Blue... just a fact though). Val Kimer did not do a good job as Philp(Alexander's dad), I don't know what to say. He just failed at the part doing absolutely horrible, shifting in and out with accents and expressions.... not acting well at all It was pretty suiting to have Anothny Hopkins as Ptolemy,... no complaints there. The acting led to a bit of a drawback to the movie barely being sub par,... but the constant flash backs and slowness of the movie slow it down.Oliver Stone, focused to much on Alexander's personality, and actually made him look like he is some crazy ruler, instead of one of the greatest rulers of all time. If Oliver Stone would have just added more info on Alexander's conquest. The movie did though make me look at Alexander the Great, in a different way. This movie basically showed that Alexander was human just like all of us. Making mistakes and having his own problems. So in a way you could say that the movie is somewhat intelligent, but I still wanted more action. This movie could have been a masterpiece, but the movie tells you a lot of stuff that you probably never heard about Alexander before. I myself know that Ancient Greeks pictured love in a different way; but still the whole bisexual Alexander kind of turned me off and ruined the rest of the movie. Look, I know it's meant to be historically accurate but, still Oliver Stone just got way to involved in that aspect; when he as a director should of focused on the conquest that actually made Alexander, ""Alexander The Great""!!!The film was just too boring and drawn out in my opinion, with nothing that impressed me except some cool visuals, that depicted cities like Babolyn to the forests of India, to the Hindu Kush mountains of Afganistan. Besides that the movie is something you may want to rent. This movie is mainly meant for a mature auidence, or History buffs like me. Hey when you see the 2 star rating, don't be fooled I still like the movie a little bit, but it just didn't capture Alexanders image correctly in my opinion. By, the way all that the Director's Cut adds is more graphic sexual content along with a few new special features. Really the Director' Cut is nothing special in my opinion, just see the threatical version.Overall, I will have to give this movie a 2.5/5ACTING: 2.5/5VISUAL/SOUND EFFECTS: 3/5QUALITY: 3/5PRESENTATION: 2.5/5SPECIAL FEATURES: 3/5OVERALL: 2.5/5I suggest you rent the movie, not entirely buy... unless you like the movie.

910408,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0009PLLN6,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 11]","**1/2""Alexander"" is a handsome but clunky attempt to duplicate those sword-and-sandal epics of the past.  Although the screenplay gets many of the details of Alexander's biography right, the movie fails to being the character himself to life, thanks, primarily, to flat writing and a wooden performance by Colin Farrell, who turns the 4th Century B.C. Macedonian leader - who pretty much single-handedly changed the course of Western civilization - into little more than a whiny, teary-eyed mama's boy (and the actor they've chosen to portray Alex at 11 looks so much like little Mark Lester in ""Oliver"" that I half expected him to break out into a chorus of ""Where Is Love?"" before his part was over).  None of the other characters make much of an impact either, although Angelina Jolie, as Olympias, his scheming, diabolical mother, turns in a scenery-chewing performance that is at least fun to watch.  Anthony Hopkins brings his trademark pomposity to the role of Ptolemy, historian and narrator of the tale, lending an air of urbane pretentiousness to the film.Almost the only thing of interest in the film is the surprisingly forthright way in which Stone deals with Alexander's long-recognized homosexuality, as reflected in his lifelong devotion to the pal of his youth, Hephaistion. Many filmmakers, aiming for the kind of mainstream audience a film of this budget and size demands, would have simply sidestepped the issue.  It's true that the one full-on sex scene is between Alexander and his Persian wife, but Stone at least leaves us with little doubt as to where Alexander's true inclinations lie.For the most part, though, this is a surprisingly conventional and even conservative film for director Stone.  Missing are the human insights and fancy directorial flourishes we've come to expect from the maker of  ""Platoon,"" ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" ""Nixon,"" and ""JFK"" (although the unsubstantiated conspiratorial ending reminds one of ""JFK"").  The dialogue is generally pedestrian and prosaic, and the story dawdles when it most needs to move on.  The battle scenes are fairly scanty and redundant, although the sight of a herd of elephants charging through the forest as part of an Indian army is definitely impressive.At just a hair shy of three hours, the director's edition of ""Alexander"" is a mighty long haul indeed.",2,lumbering epic,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,2340,"['**1/2', 'Alexander', 'handsome', 'clunky', 'attempt', 'duplicate', 'sword-and-sandal', 'epics', 'past', 'screenplay', 'many', 'details', 'Alexander', 'biography', 'right', 'movie', 'being', 'character', 'life', 'thanks', 'primarily', 'flat', 'writing', 'wooden', 'performance', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', '4th', 'Century', 'B.C', 'Macedonian', 'leader', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'single-handedly', 'changed', 'course', 'Western', 'civilization', 'little', 'more', 'whiny', 'teary-eyed', 'mama', 'boy', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'portray', 'Alex', '11', 'looks', 'so', 'much', 'little', 'Mark', 'Lester', 'Oliver', 'half', 'expected', 'break', 'out', 'chorus', 'Where', 'Love', 'part', 'was', 'over', 'None', 'other', 'characters', 'make', 'much', 'impact', 'either', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Olympias', 'scheming', 'diabolical', 'mother', 'scenery-chewing', 'performance', 'least', 'fun', 'watch', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'trademark', 'pomposity', 'role', 'Ptolemy', 'historian', 'narrator', 'tale', 'lending', 'air', 'urbane', 'pretentiousness', 'film.Almost', 'only', 'thing', 'interest', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'forthright', 'way', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'long-recognized', 'homosexuality', 'reflected', 'lifelong', 'devotion', 'pal', 'youth', 'Hephaistion', 'Many', 'filmmakers', 'aiming', 'kind', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'film', 'budget', 'size', 'demands', 'would', 'have', 'simply', 'sidestepped', 'issue', 'true', 'one', 'full-on', 'sex', 'scene', 'Alexander', 'Persian', 'wife', 'Stone', 'least', 'leaves', 'little', 'doubt', 'where', 'Alexander', 'true', 'inclinations', 'lie.For', 'most', 'part', 'though', 'surprisingly', 'conventional', 'even', 'conservative', 'film', 'director', 'Stone', 'Missing', 'are', 'human', 'insights', 'fancy', 'directorial', 'flourishes', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'maker', 'Platoon', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Nixon', 'JFK', 'unsubstantiated', 'conspiratorial', 'ending', 'one', 'JFK', 'dialogue', 'generally', 'pedestrian', 'prosaic', 'story', 'when', 'most', 'needs', 'move', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'scanty', 'redundant', 'sight', 'herd', 'elephants', 'charging', 'forest', 'part', 'Indian', 'army', 'definitely', 'impressive.At', 'just', 'hair', 'shy', 'three', 'hours', 'director', 'edition', 'Alexander', 'mighty', 'long', 'haul', 'indeed']",Alexander

When I saw the film originally at the theater, I found the plot-line somewhat confusing and was disappointed.  However, Oliver Stone's third edition of the film, Alexander Revisited:  The Final Cut--which I own--is excellent.  The battle sequences are great, and I feel the film made an earnest effort to try and recreate the ancient pagan psychology of the time.  Some of the scenes are a little difficult because the ancient world was simply more in touch with nature and the mystery, sexuality, and aimless wonder of life--so some of the scenes come off as rather disjointing because modern life and society are simply less sincere and more arrogant than the world of the ancients.  I think this awkwardness is endearing because Alexander the Great is such a difficult and bigger-than-life subject to tackle and this movie isn't afraid to showcase some of the most intimate and sacredly personal of feelings aroused by the difficult subject matter of the movie.  I thought some of the scenes were really stunningly beautiful, especially the scenes of Alexander with his mother, Olympia, and the scenes set in Macedonia.  I loved the parts of the movie that showcased Olympia's devotion to the Greek God Dionysus--the God of wine, ecstasy, theater, animal and plant nature!  God bless the Gods!  Long live the Gods!  Everything happens for a reason, and everyone who has seen the Alexander Revisited edition of this film is blessed to have seen a fine film!  I think when people invest such vitriol and hate in attacking a movie that has many redeeming qualities, one should be suspect as to their motivations and agenda!  This is a GREAT MOVIE!  And at the end of the day, that's what is is!  A movie!

In the case of Alexander, there is a wealth of potential for a wonderful epic. However, Stone, ever the Hollywood liberal, turns it into an expose on the gay lifestyle. Who cares if Alexander was gay, or if he had a complicated relationship with his mother. The fact is, he was one of the greatest warriors and military strategists of all time. However, in this version, all that is incidental to his relationship with his boyfriend. If David Lean were alive, THEN, we would have seen an epic of epic proportions. His portrayal of Lawrence of Arabia (a character similar to Alexander in many respects) portrayed the complexity of his character, including allusions to his sexuality, with class and in line with the overall storyline.

910417,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0009PLLN6,Samuel McKewon,"[8, 12]","Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" is one long, messy picture. Half of the scenes work, half don't, no two people would probably agree on which, and that's not  to say it's unwatchable. It's a $150 millon bloated epic, with passion and philosophy ""Troy"" and ""Gladiator"" never attended to. Stone quite clearly aimed for a modern ""Lawrence of Arabia."" He failed. But it's a worthy error.Alexander The Great, the Macedonian/Greek conquerer, took kingship after the murder of his father Philip, claimed all of Persia at 25, ruled in the hanging gardens of Babylon, and stretched his empire 10,000 milles to India. He never lost a military battle. He was most likely poisoned by some of his closest advisors who had been denied their return home after seven years and 50 small wars. He died at 32.The outline is important because, for one, Stone employs a narrator in Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) to tell us these things, and he has to fill in the rest of the blanks and dramatize certain relationships, such as that between the adult Alexander (Colin Ferrell) and his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), who claimed her son was not borne of King Philip (Val Kilmer) but Zeus himself. Olympias is presented as a Lady MacBeth with a Russian accent and a inferiority complex; we get the sense, really, that she would have preferred to have been born a man and king herself. Philip is a drunk and a lout, but beloved by his army. Driven by vengeance and bloodlust and not destiny, there is a gulf between he and Alexander, between a professional and a prodigy.In Alexander, Stone creates an arrogant, passionate, insecure man, given to fits and bawling, shows of affection and cruelty, greatness and shame. Stone admits Alexander's pansexualism - he ""loved"" boyhood friend Hephiaston (Jared Leto), Asian bride Roxanna (Rosario Dawson) and a eunuch - but does not push it. Most of all, Stone insists on Alexander's ambition to explore and push farther from home and the known world, for reasons he never quite reveals, although he is haunted by his mother's taunts, and his father's legacy.Because ""Alexander"" genuinely means to say something about the commonality of man vs. our tendencies to side with like skin and dialect, it's a very talky, stagelike film - long speeches, a couple roundtable sequences. Stone gives us two battles - the second of which, in India, belongs in any conversation about great war scenes - elephants, natives emerging in the jungle, and a dramatic color shift. The first battle at Gaugamela, for Persia, is confusing, muddled game capture the flag, an ancient ""Blitz to Baghdad,"" if you will. Like our three-week campaign Iraq, this strategy eventually fuels a long-running argument between Alexander and his generals. Alexander alone dreams to trailblaze to the ""outer ocean."" The rest want their lives, their family, and to enjoy the spoils of their victories.At times Ferrell seems overwhelmed by the role of Alexander; most actors would be, it asks for such a range of emotions. But he does give the conquerer a perspective, a bemused intelligence in quieter moments, a bawling rage in others. In the last hour of ""Alexander,"" the conquerer is quite clearly losing it and Ferrell charts the descent well. Ferrell is an performer, not a method actor, so when he goes for it, he does so with instinct. Recent epic heroes Russell Crowe (""Gladiator"") Orlando Bloom (""Kingdom of Heaven"") and Tom Cruise (""The Last Samurai"") have a lot more zen, even machismo, than Alexander.That Ferrell overacts in scenes as son to Olympias and Philip is not entirely his fault. Jolie would rather be seen as impressive than talented; she's an action star so fixated on cool she may never return to the land of subtlety. Her performance is pitched to a junior-high acting class on cartoon accents. I half-expected her to slither or crawl at some point, she's so unhinged. And Kilmer - though simply doing the best he can - is wrong for Philip. His greatness is told, not shown. It does not help that his performance is broken into flashbacks so scattered we can forget what we already know of him.The entire production is scattered, from Stone's fractured structure to the occasional incantation of the Greek gods - it's hard to say whether they matter to Alexander or not - to Dawson's rare and rather pointless appearances as Roxanna. ""Alexander"" could have been an hour longer and been incomplete; what's odd is that the DVD ""Director's Cut"" version is actually shorter. The movie may be Stone's rubicon - producers should never trust him with a movie of great scale again.",3,"The ""Cleopatra"" of Oliver Stone's career",1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,4570,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'one', 'long', 'messy', 'picture', 'Half', 'scenes', 'work', 'half', 'do', ""n't"", 'two', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'agree', 'not', 'say', 'unwatchable', '150', 'millon', 'bloated', 'epic', 'passion', 'philosophy', 'Troy', 'Gladiator', 'never', 'attended', 'Stone', 'quite', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'modern', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'failed', 'worthy', 'error.Alexander', 'Great', 'Macedonian/Greek', 'conquerer', 'took', 'kingship', 'murder', 'father', 'Philip', 'claimed', 'Persia', '25', 'ruled', 'hanging', 'gardens', 'Babylon', 'stretched', 'empire', '10,000', 'milles', 'India', 'never', 'lost', 'military', 'battle', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'poisoned', 'closest', 'advisors', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'denied', 'return', 'home', 'seven', 'years', '50', 'small', 'wars', 'died', '32.The', 'outline', 'important', 'one', 'Stone', 'narrator', 'Ptolemy', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'tell', 'things', 'fill', 'rest', 'blanks', 'dramatize', 'certain', 'relationships', 'such', 'adult', 'Alexander', 'Colin', 'Ferrell', 'mother', 'Olympias', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'who', 'claimed', 'son', 'was', 'not', 'borne', 'King', 'Philip', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Zeus', 'Olympias', 'presented', 'Lady', 'MacBeth', 'Russian', 'accent', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'get', 'sense', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'man', 'king', 'Philip', 'drunk', 'lout', 'beloved', 'army', 'Driven', 'vengeance', 'bloodlust', 'not', 'destiny', 'gulf', 'Alexander', 'professional', 'prodigy.In', 'Alexander', 'Stone', 'arrogant', 'passionate', 'insecure', 'man', 'given', 'fits', 'bawling', 'shows', 'affection', 'cruelty', 'greatness', 'shame', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'pansexualism', 'loved', 'boyhood', 'friend', 'Hephiaston', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Asian', 'bride', 'Roxanna', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'eunuch', 'not', 'push', 'Most', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'ambition', 'explore', 'push', 'farther', 'home', 'known', 'world', 'reasons', 'never', 'quite', 'reveals', 'haunted', 'mother', 'taunts', 'father', 'legacy.Because', 'Alexander', 'genuinely', 'say', 'something', 'commonality', 'man', 'vs.', 'tendencies', 'side', 'like', 'skin', 'dialect', 'very', 'talky', 'stagelike', 'film', 'long', 'speeches', 'couple', 'roundtable', 'sequences', 'Stone', 'two', 'battles', 'second', 'India', 'conversation', 'great', 'war', 'scenes', 'elephants', 'natives', 'emerging', 'jungle', 'dramatic', 'color', 'shift', 'first', 'battle', 'Gaugamela', 'Persia', 'confusing', 'muddled', 'game', 'capture', 'flag', 'ancient', 'Blitz', 'Baghdad', 'will', 'three-week', 'campaign', 'Iraq', 'strategy', 'eventually', 'long-running', 'argument', 'Alexander', 'generals', 'Alexander', 'alone', 'trailblaze', 'outer', 'ocean', 'rest', 'want', 'lives', 'family', 'enjoy', 'spoils', 'victories.At', 'times', 'Ferrell', 'overwhelmed', 'role', 'Alexander', 'most', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'range', 'emotions', 'give', 'conquerer', 'perspective', 'bemused', 'intelligence', 'quieter', 'moments', 'bawling', 'rage', 'others', 'last', 'hour', 'Alexander', 'conquerer', 'quite', 'clearly', 'losing', 'Ferrell', 'descent', 'well', 'Ferrell', 'performer', 'not', 'method', 'actor', 'so', 'when', 'so', 'instinct', 'Recent', 'epic', 'heroes', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Gladiator', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'zen', 'even', 'machismo', 'Alexander.That', 'Ferrell', 'scenes', 'son', 'Olympias', 'Philip', 'not', 'entirely', 'fault', 'Jolie', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'seen', 'impressive', 'talented', 'action', 'star', 'so', 'fixated', 'cool', 'may', 'never', 'return', 'land', 'subtlety', 'performance', 'pitched', 'junior-high', 'acting', 'class', 'cartoon', 'accents', 'half-expected', 'slither', 'crawl', 'point', 'so', 'unhinged', 'Kilmer', 'simply', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'wrong', 'Philip', 'greatness', 'told', 'not', 'shown', 'not', 'help', 'performance', 'broken', 'flashbacks', 'so', 'scattered', 'can', 'forget', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'him.The', 'entire', 'production', 'scattered', 'Stone', 'fractured', 'structure', 'occasional', 'incantation', 'Greek', 'gods', 'hard', 'say', 'matter', 'Alexander', 'not', 'Dawson', 'rare', 'rather', 'pointless', 'appearances', 'Roxanna', 'Alexander', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hour', 'longer', 'been', 'incomplete', 'what', 'odd', 'DVD', 'Director', 'Cut', 'version', 'actually', 'shorter', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'Stone', 'rubicon', 'producers', 'should', 'never', 'trust', 'movie', 'great', 'scale', 'again']",Alexander

910419,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B0009PLLN6,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[7, 11]","Where to begin this review?  I almost feel like I have to defend my position on actually liking the film, which is hard for me to do because my liking of it is sensory and I am usually a more factual person.What's wrong with Alexander?  Well, it's difficult to be historically accurate even while studying a practically mythological figure, but if you are making a Hollywood film it is next to impossible.  So Alexander the movie only follows the historical aspects of Alexander The Great by the finest of threads.  The dialogue is a little stiff at times also, attempting to modernize into a recognizable pattern the speeches and rituals of a civilization that existed before Christ.  There's a Colin Farrell ""buffalo shot"" that should have been edited out.  And the plot skips around quite a bit, in an unnecessary fashion.  It could have been bloodier, too.What's right with Alexander?  For one thing, the stunning photography, breathtaking scenery, costume design, and realistic props and settings.  The battle scenes are spectacular, with arrows and pikes and vast armies.  There is one scene in particular, where Alexander goes up against a barbarian, filmed in slow motion as both horse and elephant rear up in facing off with each other, that is so captivating you will find yourself holding your breath.Colin Farrell did a remarkably good job in portraying Alexander, and Val Kilmer was exceptionally, and startlingly, good as Alexander's father, Philip.  Anthony Hopkins as Old Ptolemy and Christopher Plummer as Aristotle did fine performances, but their parts in the film were lesser than their known talents.  Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother Olympias, surprised me.  Normally, I don't care for her acting, but she fit the role perfectly as a deadly beauty who fondles snakes and schemes for her son's greatness.  I've liked Rosario Dawson since her early appearance in 'Kids', and she doesn't disappoint in her role as Roxane, Alexander's barbarian wife.  I think that her part should have been greater in the film, with more played off of her love/hate relationship with Alexander, but this was a big story to put into one film anyway.  And Jared Leto...woof!  When did Jared Leto become hot?  When he put on eyeliner and a long-haired wig?  I'm not sure, but he plays his role as Hephaistion, Alexander's same-$ex lover, quite well.Alexander, then, amounts to some very nice eye-candy to watch for its entertainment value.  It's not a documentary but an epically filmed interpretation of Alexander's battle years, when he conquered most of the civilized world (at that time) in the span of eight short years.  Imagine 2500 years from now a film being made about, say, Ronald Reagan.  Will it be accurate?  Doubtful, but it will most likely be made to please the people of that era.So sit back, pop some popcorn, put the DVD on the bigscreen TV and turn the volume down.  Don't worry about what people say about the $exuality in the film, it is not overt or overplayed, it is simply portrayed as part of Alexander's life, as was common during the time frame of the epic.

910420,A3FNZQU6KBXWLM,B0009PLLN6,Scott Delo,"[11, 14]","I loved Alexander, but then I'm a classical Greek and Roman history nut. Three years ago, I decided to work my way through history from the Bronze Age to the present. I haven't been able to get past the Greeks and Romans. Every time I read something like Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides or Xenophon, I'm lead somewhere else that's equally worthy of my time.Without question, Alexander the Great is one of the most fascinating figures in history. The only one I can think of to rival him is Julius Caesar, who, ironically, shared both his voracious appetite for power and his sexual ambiguity. I found Stone's biopic to be very true to the Alexander I read about in history. He was a man capable of both great compassion and great rage. He very much wore his heart on his sleeve, which is why he could murder a close friend over an insult and then wail with grief after the friend died. In many ways, Alexander was too big for this world. How could one country, one lover or one sexual orientation satisfy him?I think mainstream movie goers weren't ready for Alexander. When they go to a sandal and sword epic, they want to see Mel Gibson, Russell Crow or Tom Cruise wade into a nice ordered battle with his sword swinging. They want to see the opposing army die easily and not leave a scratch, like they are supposed to. Then they want to see their hero come back home to the waiting arms of his female partner where they can have passionate but civilized sex. I'm afraid that's not the way it was. Battles were, and are, chaotic messes where the dust, noise and action made it difficult to tell what's going on. Bisexuality was commonplace in Ancient Greece, in fact it was state-sanctioned in Sparta. It makes me laugh when people criticize films for being too formulaic. Then a film like this comes along and everybody complains that it lacks cohesion. In other words, it doesn't follow the formula. The film seems disjointed and complicated because Alexander's life was disjointed and complicated.Stone is clearly a fellow student of history and has a particular affinity for Alexander. This comes across in the wondrous battle sequences. Stone brought the Battle of Gaugamela to life and did it right! The infantry is in phalanx  formation, the dust is flying and one flank of the army has absolutely no idea what the other flank is doing. This is exactly the way it happened.If I have any criticism for this film it is that Stone didn't give the whole story. Clearly, if the film is to have any value in the future then it will be among people like me who share his passion for history.

This was Oliver Stone's 3rd attempt at getting it right and he didn't. I understand he is re-cutting it for a 4th time but he doesn't understand that his biggest problem was that he started with the wrong actor. Colin Farrell is NO Alexander. He is unappealing, overwrought, and just plain hopeless at his attempts to bring this larger than life figure to the screen. The 2nd biggest problem is that Alexander accomplished too much in his short life to ever be portrayed in even a 4 hour film - a 12 hr. mini-series might be enough for the high points. As a result, there was a great deal left out, or so compressed that it became confusing. The secondary actors were interchangeable to the point where even informed viewers had trouble telling one from the other. The actress who played his wife - I've blocked out her name - was just plain awful on every level. Even Antony Hopkins in his cameo role looked lost. The only actors who did a professional job were Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer as Alexander's parents. However, if Stone had dropped the whole &#34;child as the father to the man&#34; psychobabble and just concentrated on Alexander as an adult it would have been a better use of the time.It's a shame that one of the most fascinating stories in history is apparently too complex for anyone to put into coherent terms on film. For ancient history enthusiasts, the film is worth seeing even just to groan over the countless mistakes. For the less historically inclined, there are some interesting action and battle sequences. There is little character development and perhaps that is the greatest loss. Alexander was not just a King and conqueror. He was a statesman, diplomat, and builder. A lover of music, literature and drama. A man who spread the civilized arts throughout most of the known world and the 1st man ever to try to bring all of his peoples together to form one great empire in which they could all be equal citizens.

I believe it was within the first ten minutes or so that I started feeling like I wanted the movie to end soon.  The movie fails to impress on nearly every level, and I'd have to lay blame equally on Stone's direction and what should qualify as the worst screenplay/script upon which anyone's ever based a hundred plus million dollar movie.  Well... maybe that honor should go to Waterworld, but that's arguable.In a movie like this, where the focus is on one of the sigle most influential, dynamic, forceful personalities in history, you'd think that some real character development would be an essential ingredient in the film.  Instead, we get 20 second blurbs of some less-than-powerful monents in his youth peppered with some powerful scenes that try to reach for high drama yet just seem out of place and disjointed.  Like that 5 minute stagger through the wall murals with his father... dear God, we miss 99% of what made this man who he is, and Stone sacrifices five minutes on THAT?  Stone also completely skips his maturation into a warrior/general.  I mean COMPLETELY.  We totally miss his charisma as a leader of men and his brilliance as a tactician and/or visionary.  One scene, he's a boy.  The next, he's already liberated a chunk of Persia (we don't get to see this... it's literally the next scene) and is leading the charge to take the Persian army in the only decent battle scene in the film.  He is turned back, but not to worry, the very next scene he's walking into Babylon while the narrator informs us he came back and won.  His entire eastward campaign (and thus the movie) just sort of happens in this same fashion... the narrator says stuff like ""and then Alexander took &lt;fill in any country here>"" and we jump to a victory scene where he sits and drinks wine and the vanquished foe has people dance for him.  The battles we do see are poorly filmed with very little drama or energy, a complete lack of director's focus, and some of the least effective cinematography ever used in such scenes.Egads... in writing this I'm getting upset all over again at having wasted an evening on this film.

The film doesn't spend any time on what made Alexander ""Great"" and why he's still studied today:  his genius for strategy and tactics in military operations.2.  Some of his judgment blunders (ex. burning the palace at Persepolis during a drunken orgy) that sowed mistrust among his army, the conquered Persians and back in Macedon.3.

Scenes are now allowed to flow better, making this a more complete movie experience.The great performances are made even better with the new footage, and supporting characters are fleshed out even more, especially the character of Bagoas, who we now get to feel for.

In fact, it is quite good...in spots.The film drags a bit.  The story line moves back and forth in time, alternating between Alexander as king and conqueror and as son/heir apparent to Phillip.  Some like that device.  I, personally, feel that it is overused, somewhat cliche.The characters are well developed.  Colin Ferrell and the rest of the cast did admirable work.  The battle scenes are enjoyable but sometimes confusing (particularly the battle at Guagamela) and few and far between.Post Braveheart, movies about ""great"" men tend to deify them, tend to thrust upon the virtues or values of our civilization.  It was a bit hard to swallow that Alexander wanted conquer the then known world, not for riches, the spoils of war or the glory of conquest, but to free slaves and spread Greek civilization to the ""heathens.""  This much is suggested by Alexander in the film, a position that seems to starkly contrast berating of his generals for viewing Asians as an inferior civilization/people.There is a lot of information packed in the story.  One of the side benefits of a film like this is that it causes history lovers (like me) to learn the ""true"" story about Alexander, his family, his enemies, etc.Much is made about the bi-sexuality exhibited.  Anyone that has even a cursory knowledge of ancient history knows or has heard that Greek men were lovers of other men and kept women as wives and mothers.  I certainly don't proclaim to be an expert on the subject, but it seemed that the ""men"" or ""boys"" to which Alexander and his generals were attracted were extremely effeminate, almost drag queens.  I understand that Greek men loved men precisely because they were men, not because they looked like flat-chested women.  It is a rather minor point, but since the sexual themes in the film seem never to be ignored, it is worth discussion.Overall, it is a good film.  It's by no means great.

910443,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0009PLLN6,Terry Mesnard,"[4, 5]","For those who did enjoy Oliver Stone's Alexander (I, for the record was not one of them), be warned that this is probably one of the few times in the history of Director's Cuts that the film is cut down from the Theatrical cut.  Due to what Oliver Stone perceived as America's disinterest in this movie based on the bisexual themes involved, the Director's Cut is devoid of many, if not all, references to this.  If you are a fan of the movie, make sure you know this prior to purchasing.  Personally, I think it's a bit shady of them to release a Director's Cut when the moniker is usually used for movies that had scenes cut from the theatrical version restored.Also, in reference to the two DVD editions.  This edition is on one disc.  For the theatrical cut, I suppose because it's less than 10 minutes longer, is on two discs for the movie itself.About the movie, though.  I guess this movie has been deeply polarizing for audience members.  I'm not sure if its because of the bisexual themes or if its because it just wasn't a good movie.  I notice people defending the film talk about the subtle nuances that Oliver Stone employed in his story.  I noticed these as well, and I applaud some of his use not only of symbolism but also imagery for a concrete reason.  However, subtle nuances and symbolism alone does not a good movie make.  Nor does it make a good epic necessarily.When I saw this movie in the theatre, I noticed a few people leave pretty much as soon as any bisexual themes were hinted at.  The bisexual themes did not bother me in the least.  I want to get that out of the way so that I'm not immediately discounted.  I was completely aware (as I assumed most people were) that it is generally known that Alexander had feelings for his friend Hephastos.  In every single history class from junior high to College had made that pretty clear, either overtly or subtly.  If you are going to make a movie about this situation, however, you have to do it carefully.  Not only because of the apparent tumultous culture we live in today, but also because it can come across as silly.In Alexander, this is exactly what happened.  Instead of seriously examining these issues, which would have made a very interesting to watch character in Alexander, Oliver Stone made a melodrama.  He turned Alexander into an angsty teen who bats his eyes while looking at Hephastos longingly behind locks of silly hair.  There's no emotion there besides soap opera melodrama.  Honestly, if you replaced the fact that Alexander was fawning over a female instead of Hephastos, I would still have this reaction.  It was executed very poorly.  And not only that, but seemed to be tacked on as if to make a comment and nothing more.But its not only this that warrants my bad review.  The silliness did not stop with the love triangle.  First off, casting a woman a year older than Colin Farrel to play his mother is just odd.  Not only that, but to give her such a horribly done slavish/Transylvanian accent just undermined any sort of seriousness.  Then there's everyone else's accents that seem to change as the movie progresses.  For an epic movie, the battles are very important and the battles here were filmed so haphazardly and chaotically that yes it probably was a good representation of war, but as a movie it just doesn't work.  How can you root for the good side when you can't tell who is winning because everyone looks the same?  The movie began on a rocky start (Val Kilmer as the father figure was just as ham-handed as anything else) and only went down hill from there.  I'll admit, the first maybe half of the movie was vaguely intersting if melodramatic.  But when Alexander reaches India, things just spiraled into boredom.  My group was checking their watches, wishing for it to be over.My gripe, then, is a more moderate one.  I don't care what the film is about.  But it was not done well.  It was boring, and for an epic film that is the one thing it shouldn't be.  For a movie to hold your attention for 3 hours or more it has to be exciting.  Alexander failed in this, as it also did in exploring his relationship with Hephastos and his wife.  It seemed hacked on as if for the only reason than a political one to say, hey look Alexander had feelings for his male friend.  In the end, a boring and melodramatic movie.",2,Be Warned!,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,4336,"['who', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'record', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'be', 'warned', 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'history', 'Director', 'Cuts', 'film', 'cut', 'down', 'Theatrical', 'cut', 'Due', 'what', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'perceived', 'America', 'disinterest', 'movie', 'based', 'bisexual', 'themes', 'involved', 'Director', 'Cut', 'devoid', 'many', 'not', 'references', 'are', 'fan', 'movie', 'make', 'sure', 'know', 'prior', 'purchasing', 'Personally', 'think', 'bit', 'shady', 'release', 'Director', 'Cut', 'when', 'moniker', 'usually', 'used', 'movies', 'had', 'scenes', 'cut', 'theatrical', 'version', 'restored.Also', 'reference', 'two', 'DVD', 'editions', 'edition', 'one', 'disc', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'suppose', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'longer', 'two', 'discs', 'movie', 'movie', 'guess', 'movie', 'been', 'deeply', 'polarizing', 'audience', 'members', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'bisexual', 'themes', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'notice', 'people', 'defending', 'film', 'talk', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'employed', 'story', 'noticed', 'well', 'applaud', 'use', 'not', 'only', 'symbolism', 'also', 'imagery', 'concrete', 'reason', 'However', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'symbolism', 'alone', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'make', 'make', 'good', 'epic', 'necessarily.When', 'saw', 'movie', 'theatre', 'noticed', 'few', 'people', 'leave', 'pretty', 'much', 'as', 'soon', 'bisexual', 'themes', 'were', 'hinted', 'bisexual', 'themes', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'least', 'want', 'get', 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'immediately', 'discounted', 'was', 'completely', 'aware', 'assumed', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'generally', 'known', 'Alexander', 'had', 'feelings', 'friend', 'Hephastos', 'single', 'history', 'class', 'junior', 'high', 'College', 'had', 'made', 'pretty', 'clear', 'either', 'overtly', 'subtly', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'situation', 'however', 'have', 'do', 'carefully', 'Not', 'only', 'apparent', 'tumultous', 'culture', 'live', 'today', 'also', 'can', 'come', 'silly.In', 'Alexander', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Instead', 'seriously', 'examining', 'issues', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'character', 'Alexander', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'made', 'melodrama', 'turned', 'Alexander', 'angsty', 'teen', 'who', 'eyes', 'looking', 'Hephastos', 'longingly', 'locks', 'silly', 'hair', 'emotion', 'there', 'soap', 'opera', 'melodrama', 'Honestly', 'replaced', 'fact', 'Alexander', 'was', 'fawning', 'female', 'instead', 'Hephastos', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'reaction', 'was', 'executed', 'very', 'poorly', 'not', 'only', 'seemed', 'be', 'tacked', 'make', 'comment', 'nothing', 'more.But', 'not', 'only', 'warrants', 'bad', 'review', 'silliness', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'love', 'triangle', 'First', 'casting', 'woman', 'year', 'older', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'play', 'mother', 'just', 'odd', 'Not', 'only', 'give', 'such', 'horribly', 'done', 'slavish/Transylvanian', 'accent', 'just', 'undermined', 'sort', 'seriousness', 'Then', 'everyone', 'else', 'accents', 'seem', 'change', 'movie', 'epic', 'movie', 'battles', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'battles', 'here', 'were', 'filmed', 'so', 'haphazardly', 'chaotically', 'probably', 'was', 'good', 'representation', 'war', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'How', 'can', 'root', 'good', 'side', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'winning', 'everyone', 'same', 'movie', 'began', 'rocky', 'start', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'father', 'figure', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'ham-handed', 'anything', 'else', 'only', 'went', 'down', 'hill', 'there', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'first', 'maybe', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'vaguely', 'intersting', 'melodramatic', 'when', 'Alexander', 'India', 'things', 'just', 'spiraled', 'boredom', 'group', 'was', 'checking', 'watches', 'wishing', 'be', 'over.My', 'gripe', 'then', 'more', 'moderate', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'well', 'was', 'boring', 'epic', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'hold', 'attention', '3', 'hours', 'more', 'be', 'exciting', 'Alexander', 'failed', 'also', 'did', 'exploring', 'relationship', 'Hephastos', 'wife', 'seemed', 'hacked', 'only', 'reason', 'political', 'one', 'say', 'hey', 'look', 'Alexander', 'had', 'feelings', 'male', 'friend', 'end', 'boring', 'melodramatic', 'movie']",Alexander

Oliver Stone, I think focused a little on being historical accurately, and telling about Alexander's life, that he forgot the conquest part and the whole action thing!!! I really never got why Angelia Jolie, played as Alexander's mother either!!! I will admit the battle at the beggining against the mighty Persians was visually amazing, along with the battle in the forests of India, with stampeding elephants in a great bloody battle!!!The movie did indeed show that Alexander was a great military leader, but also had some problems, like becoming a power crazed self centered dicator, while being a bisexual lover, which I really don't want to see a movie about, but I guess it is historically accurate which I gave it credit though!!! Maybe if thaey showed some more action,and made a movie more like ""Troy"", which is a great movie I might add, which has everything Alexander lacks in!!! The actors, did a great job acting, but the story and plot is just off wack and plainly below par!!!The movie was just plainly weak, and bland and could have been way better than this, but I will respect it for being historicallly accurate!!! I don't respect it for lack of action, along with the many plot holes!! I also don't mean to put any body down either, by my statements, but I really wanted a action movie!!! The special features on the second disc are pretty much crap as well!!!Well, I guess it beats the text book, but I will probably never see it again!!! I suggest, that you might want to rent it before you buy it!!! Most people will rent it once and never want to see it again!!! Some people may enjoy it, it's your choice, but this is not for real action fans!!!Overall, I will give this a 2/5..... an overall below average and plainly weak movie.Pros:-Angelia Jolie is in the movie-Some nice battle scenes-Historicaly accurateCons:-I never got why Angelia Jolie played as Alexander's mother!!!-A bisexual love story......... are you kidding me, that's sick!!-Lack of action in general, and a plainly rushed movie!!!-Plainly a bland story, with a lot of plot holes!!!-Special features aren't that good either!!!I will not suggest that you buy this movie, ......

It was understandable that the issue makes many uneasy however I would say that if you are going to address the issue than be factual or say nothing at all. Many films being produced today make us uneasy with how they handle issues. That is what gives them an edge and enhances the viewing.

910450,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B0009PLLN6,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[42, 44]","There aren't too many epic filmakers these days, and just about all of them court controversy at some point in their careers. Oliver Stone is just that kind of a man. From ""JFK"" to the recent ""World Trade Center,"" he is not afraid to make decisions that will rankle people. Such is the case with his glorious mess, ""Alexander."" Everything about this movie is so right that the total failure of the film to connect can only lie on Stone's shoulders.Colin Farrell plays Alexander as a troubled Mama's boy. The much debated 'gay content' is limited to googely-eyes shared between Farrell and Jared Leto (the hottest sex scene is when Rosario Dawson and Farrell get it on). Everyone - from Farrell to Val Kilmer, speaks as if Macedonia was Northern Ireland. Except Angelina Jolie, who plays Alexander's mother like she just left a gig doing Natasha voice overs for ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoons. Kilmer, by the way, is nothing short of brilliant as King Phillip. I didn't even recognize him at first, he is so enveloped in the role.The filming itself is rich, lush, beautiful. So what does Stone do with it? Everyone stands up and makes speeches. Over and over, people talk on and on through scenes that go way beyond their need. Anthony Hopkin's voice overs give the film a much needed narrative connectivity, yet Hopkins himself barely appears. When he DOES show up, it is to pontificate like he's onstage at some Shakespearian production.The battle scenes are mammoth, chaotic, splendid. That is, unless you want to have any indication of who is fighting who. Then, all the thrown dust and swirling camera work leave you guessing. Same with the bizarrely intercut timelines. You will have several WTF moments as you try to figure out not just the what, but the when an activity is taking place. Be patient and you will be rewarded with the spectacle of Alexander's final battle in India, with charging elephants and stunning scenery.When comparing ""Alexander"" to ""Troy"" or ""Kingdom Of Heaven,"" Stone's movie falls somewhere between the two. ""Alexander"" is more an accurate portrayal of Alexander than ""Troy's"" bungling of Homer's Iliad, (at least Stone didn't flinch away from bi-sexuality they way Wolfgang Peterson did with Achilles in ""Troy""), but Troy never felt like it was dragging in pace. One the other hand, Colin Farell and the cast of ""Alexander"" are far more convincing than ""Kingdom Of Heaven,"" even if I believe Ridley Scott managed to craft the more watchable movie.It's too bad that all this amazing work is left floundering in chaos, becuase ""Alexander"" had all the making of a brilliant movie. It is so ambitious that I can't help but add the fourth star, but I suspect that a few more edits might have made this a more choherent movie. We all know Oliver Stone has it in him, after all, he made a movie that was mostly two hours of men buried in rubble fascinating.

910452,A1IWVIOBEMZ5OQ,B0009PLLN6,Timothy D. Naegele,"[5, 13]","In the pantheon of the greatest human beings who ever lived, in terms of influencing the history of the world, Jesus Christ ""ranks"" number one and Alexander the Great ranks number two, for similar albeit different reasons.  Both influenced history more than others, and died at essentially the same age, 33.  Jesus changed man's relationship to God and thereby ""conquered"" much of the world, while Alexander's territorial conquests spread democracy and the assimilation of disparate cultures.  Both were remarkable leaders who possessed super-human qualities, including wisdom and fearlessness.In a sense, their lives were intertwined because the spread of Christianity as a world religion (owing to the Greek language), as well as the Roman Empire and the long centuries of Byzantium are all said to be the fruits of Alexander's achievements. As a general, Alexander (or Alexander III of Macedon, 356-323 B.C.) is considered to be among the greatest the world has ever known.  He was recognized as pharaoh (or god incarnate) of Egypt; and his general Ptolemy founded the fabled Egyptian dynasty that ended with the death of Cleopatra (who was named for Alexander's full sister), the last of the Ptolemies.  Alexander's wife, Roxane, is a story of love and alliances-and of their son, born posthumously.It is sad, but totally predictable, that the epic tale of Alexander's life and deeds has been twisted by Oliver Stone, whose perversion of the topics he films is legendary.  Why any movie studio finances this hack remains a mystery.  One need know little or nothing about ""Alexander,"" the movie, to realize that Stone would turn the great Alexander into a farcical Gay hero, or bisexual at best. Yet, there is no historical evidence that such was the case.  At that time in history, bisexuality was present just as it is today; however, it was predictable before the first camera rolled that Stone would make such characteristics central to Alexander's character.Also, it is clear that Stone miscast the leading actors in his film, and that it is disjointed and fails to depict any greatness at all.  While the story of Alexander's life and accomplishments and place in history is a tale that surpasses David Lean's brilliant and timeless ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" Stone is incapable of telling such a story or picking the actors to enrich the screen, much as the young Peter O'Toole played T.E. Lawrence so magnificently.  It is only too bad that Lean is not alive to do justice to such an epic; Stone is a rank amateur when compared to the greatness of Lean.While due respect might be given to Stone's ability to raise the money in Hollywood (and abroad) for such a film-where history is distorted on a daily basis-""Alexander"" was doomed from the moment when Stone was chosen because of his lack of talent, political biases, and inability to properly cast the film.  He failed, whereas the true story of Alexander succeeded beyond one's wildest imagination. To read the history of Alexander's life is to realize that he surpassed the exploits of his revered Greek gods.  Yet, Stone lacks even a modicum of greatness as a moviemaker to depict one of the greatest figures and stories in history.Stone's reputation is tainted, which is certainly true of his films.

It is raining there are moneys all over the place and the troops march through jungle. Now in reality the part of India invaded by Alexander was north west India. A rather dry place which is now Pakistan. There were no jungles and monkies would have been confined to cages. Why is it that a film is just so inaccurate?At the battle of Guagamela 47,000 heavily armed Greeks met a large number of lightly armed Persians. The Greeks lost 500 killed. Yet the conclusion of this battle looks more like aftermath of the battle of Borodino in which tens of thousands were killed.However the major irritation is not the historical howlers. At school there are two types of people. Those who are good at sport and those who like reading books. The ones who are good at sport develop a self confidence early on and are free of doubt in themselves and what to do. Those who read books are always full of self doubt and dither when faced by decisions. Alexander was a person who was raised for militiary command since being born and commanded large bodies of men from the age of 17. There is not the slightest suggestion that he ever suffered from self confidence or doubt in himself. His invasion of the Persian Empire was a meticulously thought out operation which involved the neutralisation of the Western part of the empire to destroy Persian sea power and to free the Greek cities in Ionia. Alexander then moved to conquer the centre of the Empire.Stone's portrait of Alexander is one of the sort of kid at school who read books, who was eaten by self doubt and dithered. Not only is Alexander portrayed in that way so are his generals. Prior to the battle of Guagamela which was an easy win the movie portrays Alexander's generals as wanting to retreat or not to engage. The historical accounts suggest that after previous victories including Issus the Greeks knew that they would win and Alexander's generals were more confident than he was.The ancients saw Alexander's life as a tragedy. He started his campaign with Greek virtues but he began to be seduced by barbarian customs. He wanted his soldiers to prostate themselves to him and he wanted to merge the Persian and Greek peoples. Stone has a different approach. He sees Alexander as a wounded soul because of his fathers rejection of him and his mother. The real Alexander was not a 20th century feel good type who suffered from identity issues. He was a person who was raised in what was at the time the most militarily developed part of the world and he set about using his country to conquer the world.Still the costumes are good.",1,Costumes were nice,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,2641,"['end', 'film', 'Alexander', 'India', 'raining', 'are', 'moneys', 'place', 'troops', 'march', 'jungle', 'Now', 'reality', 'part', 'India', 'invaded', 'Alexander', 'was', 'north', 'west', 'India', 'A', 'rather', 'dry', 'place', 'now', 'Pakistan', 'were', 'jungles', 'monkies', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'confined', 'cages', 'Why', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'inaccurate', 'battle', 'Guagamela', '47,000', 'heavily', 'armed', 'Greeks', 'met', 'large', 'number', 'lightly', 'armed', 'Persians', 'Greeks', 'lost', '500', 'killed', 'conclusion', 'battle', 'more', 'aftermath', 'battle', 'Borodino', 'tens', 'thousands', 'were', 'killed.However', 'major', 'irritation', 'not', 'historical', 'howlers', 'school', 'are', 'two', 'types', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'sport', 'who', 'like', 'reading', 'books', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'sport', 'develop', 'self', 'confidence', 'early', 'are', 'free', 'doubt', 'what', 'do', 'who', 'read', 'books', 'are', 'always', 'full', 'self', 'doubt', 'dither', 'when', 'faced', 'decisions', 'Alexander', 'was', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'militiary', 'command', 'being', 'born', 'commanded', 'large', 'bodies', 'men', 'age', '17', 'not', 'slightest', 'suggestion', 'ever', 'suffered', 'self', 'confidence', 'doubt', 'invasion', 'Persian', 'Empire', 'was', 'meticulously', 'thought', 'out', 'operation', 'involved', 'neutralisation', 'Western', 'part', 'empire', 'destroy', 'Persian', 'sea', 'power', 'free', 'Greek', 'cities', 'Ionia', 'Alexander', 'then', 'moved', 'conquer', 'centre', 'Empire.Stone', 'portrait', 'Alexander', 'one', 'sort', 'kid', 'school', 'who', 'read', 'books', 'who', 'was', 'eaten', 'self', 'doubt', 'dithered', 'Not', 'only', 'Alexander', 'portrayed', 'way', 'so', 'are', 'generals', 'Prior', 'battle', 'Guagamela', 'was', 'easy', 'win', 'movie', 'Alexander', 'generals', 'wanting', 'retreat', 'not', 'engage', 'historical', 'accounts', 'suggest', 'previous', 'victories', 'including', 'Issus', 'Greeks', 'knew', 'would', 'win', 'Alexander', 'generals', 'were', 'more', 'confident', 'ancients', 'saw', 'Alexander', 'life', 'tragedy', 'started', 'campaign', 'Greek', 'virtues', 'began', 'be', 'seduced', 'barbarian', 'customs', 'wanted', 'soldiers', 'prostate', 'wanted', 'merge', 'Persian', 'Greek', 'peoples', 'Stone', 'different', 'approach', 'Alexander', 'wounded', 'soul', 'fathers', 'rejection', 'mother', 'real', 'Alexander', 'was', 'not', '20th', 'century', 'feel', 'good', 'type', 'who', 'suffered', 'identity', 'issues', 'was', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'what', 'was', 'time', 'most', 'militarily', 'developed', 'part', 'world', 'set', 'about', 'using', 'country', 'conquer', 'world.Still', 'costumes', 'are', 'good']",Alexander
910456,AZVA13Q19KURR,B0009PLLN6,"T. P Roberts ""Terry212am""","[10, 13]","Look...I'm one of those people who really HATES it when they make ""historical"" movies that deviate HORRIBLY from history. This movie tracks VERY close to history. I think modern Americans haven't received it well because Alexander ends up having intercourse with 1) a black woman; and 2) men. Well, guess what...Alexander was bisexual. And including that bit of history was not just titillation--it was historically important, as the lack of an heir to his throne was VERY important to history. Also, the distress over his lover's death was well-documented. The story of Alexander the Great is one that has enthralled every generation for 2300 years...up until this one. Our generation seems to prefer rap videos. Wake up. Alexander is history's greatest general. He did what no one dared--attack and unite most of the known world. Everything but the personal conversations in this movie REALLY happened...and all the personal conversations are necessary to flesh out the things we DON'T know (Alexander stands in for historians when he asks his mother if he arranged his father's assassination, for instance. Her answer is unconvincing to Alexander...and to historians, too). This story is important. Alexander united everything between Greece and China under one roof, if only for a moment. It's a HUGE bit of history. The fact that people don't know or care is pathetic. Some reviewers carped on Angelina Jolie's slavic accent. Her character was from Epirus, which is roughly analogous to modern day Albania. We don't know what their accents sounded like, but a Slavic accent was as good as any. The IDEA was likely to emphasize that Olympias was not seen as Greek or Macedonian, really, by Philip, etc. She was seen as alien. An outsider. Some reviewers were bothered that Alexander was so emotional, etc.  Well, all historical accounts say that he really WAS that way (as were many ancient leaders and peoples--Romans cried in public all the time).

910457,A18C1PCR8WUAST,B0009PLLN6,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[31, 44]","While I cannot imagine anyone truly capturing either Alexander the man, nor his life and its complexities, certainly the worst people one might think of are the Irish Colin Farrel and American director Oliver Stone. Without the ability to truly understand how a boy who stood 5'9"" tall, was absolutely gorgeous, inwardly destroyed by his devouring mother and bewildered yet powerful father, who led his first army as general before the age of 16, whose life-long companion was another man, Hephastion, and his only ""lover"" of record a Persian eunuch named Bagoas--without the ability to enter into the time, place, and mores of both, the story simply cannot be told in a couple of hours on a movie screen in a time and place where such details would bring out the therapists in force. Yet @ 2300 yrs. ago these circumstances came together to create the extraordinarily magnetic and indomitable force of nature now called ""Alexander the Great."" His two marriages were politically motivated (and to get an heir), his belief in his half-godhood absolute (his mother had taught him that Philip was not his father, but rather a god who came to her in man-form to beget him) and his determination to conquer the world driven by a constant need to test himself against all the odds that could be found. Homosexuality was the norm then, not the exception; actually bisexuality was most common, with Philip moving between boys, young men, and girls in constant succession as just one example. There was no judgement about this--but modern American audiences seem unable to understand that sexual ""norms"" change with time and place constantly, or that our Puritan values are not even remotely absolutes, even in the rest of the world right now.Yet the supposedly maverick director, Oliver Stone, cannot bring himself to fully enter into this mentality, but rather emphasizes a political, formal, and brief relationship that consisted of marginal sex (Roxanne), barely enough to produce a son (she was pregnant when Alexander died), that Bagoas was Alexander's nightly lover, Hephastion his true spouse. Roxanne was never made queen. She was a secondary wife. His wife of state, Stateira, was murdered by Roxanne the moment Alexander died--just as Olympias had had Philip's wife and son killed the moment he died and Alexander's back was turned.Alexander himself exuded such authority and command that he was able to lead men who'd been full-grown when he was a babe, but Colin Farrel's wide-eyed vacancy just cannot capture his essence, let alone the belief in his deeds. And without these essentials firmly in place, the rest is pointless. We know that Alexander conquered all of the known world, so seeing him do it in battle after battle isn't terribly fascinating to watch; watching Alexander himself taking exercise would have been more compelling.Oddly, Olympias, played by Angelina Jolie, is not even given her famous red hair--apparently the budget didn't allow for hair dye. Presumably her strange accent is to communicate that she comes from another part of Greece: she was from Epiros, while Philip was an Argive, and they all three lived in MACEDON (which while called ""Macedonia"" in the film, is not to be confused with the current country Macedonia, which isn't even in the same place). She was indeed a Priestess of Dionysis, her snakes were sacred creatures--all of them non-poisonous house snakes, and in the film, clearly constrictors, yet she warns Alexander against them ""striking,"" a physical impossibility (this is the level of inaccuracy on display here). She tried to rule through Alexander, whom she'd dominated all her life. Jolie could have been wonderful, had she been allowed to play Olympias, rather than a sort of Dracula-figure of Stone's imagination. She was a deeply dangerous woman, in fact, whose murders were so numerous that she was condemned to death after her son died, yet so revered was Alexander that no one dared kill his mother. In the end she was given over by Kassandros to the relations of those she'd killed, who tore her apart (literally). What fun Jolie could have had with some of the most famous of Olympias' escapades, had she ever seen them written in the script. Roxanne and her unprotected son ended murdered, also by Kassandros, amidst the wars the shook Greece when Alexander died. The wars of succession did, in fact, tear Alexander's great accomplishment apart--the unification of the known world under one central leader disintegrated as his ""heirs"" fought over the pieces they were strong enough to hold. Only Ptolemy lasted, establishing Alexandria and contiuing his line through to the great Kleopatra.Any movie that requires constant narration is in deep trouble--the ponderous narration of Hopkins as Ptolemy (who is now old, but was in fact only ten years older than Alexander, his half-brother and dear friend) once he's become Pharoah (in Alexandria, which then became the capital city of the Persian Empire) after the wars of succession following Alexander's demise at 33, is even more irritating than the off-color performances and wrongly presented ""facts."" Trying to piece together this patchwork quilt of disastrous episodes, Hopkins does his best, but doesn't have much of a chance. And after narrating this entire movie to his scribes, he dismisses the story as mere ""story"" and ""changes"" history to the unknowable. This especially makes one wonder why Stone went to all this trouble and expense, if he himself was going to end by undermining what he's told (however inaccurately).Nor does poor Jared Leto get much of substance to do, having been tongue- and hog-tied into being a silent partner despite playing the most important person in Alexander's life; he mostly stands around looking supportive and adoringly at his spouse, but we don't see him as the powerful commander he was, and most importantly, the second self that Alexander considered him to be. We see that he's allowed to read the royal mail from Olympias, but it's never explained why this is significant, nor do we see the really important act which followed it. When another soldier called out to Alexander, ""Why can't we read your mail, too?"" Alexander took off his signet ring, pressed it against Hephastion's lips, and then smiled at the assembly, publicly declaring their one-ness to all. Later, when Bagoas, his Persian lover, won the dancing crown, the crowd cried out to Alexander to ""kiss the boy,"" which he did. Alexander was certainly unafraid of letting people know who mattered to him, so why Stone should be squeamish is truly mysterious. And so well was Hephastion's status known that it has always been understood that Alexander willed himself to death after his death--the deliberate lack of care for himself that brought on the fever that took his life, came right after Alexander had received the news from Zeus Ammon's oracle that Hephastion would not be made a demigod. This devestated him; his mourning had been intense for three months, and he'd given Hephastion a funeral and pyre more extravagant than those given to Kings. He was already feared to have lost his reason by this time, due to his army's reluctance to continue and his forced acceptance at having to go home, and the loss of his life-long love was too much. After having driven himself without mercy since he was a small boy, he collapsed. His final act was to allow his grieving army to file past his bed--it took hours and left him in a coma from which he never woke. He was alone with Bagoas and the Companions at the door when he slipped out of consciousness, though his well-documented ""failure to decay"" which was then attributed to his semi-godhood status is now recognized as deep coma, in which he lingered for several days in the hot desert while his soldiers fought. Finally he was taken away to be embalmed, without having lost any of his beauty. Several hundred years later, his preserved body was observed as ""looking like a sleeping man, still rich with beauty and life-force"" (I think by Curtius).Many other famous events are rendered incorrectly: Kassandros (called Kassander here), played with nasty glee by the ever and ever-better Johathyn Rhys-Meyers, was Alexander's mortal enemy, and had been cut out from his ""companions,"" and left behind in Macedon long before Alexander died, yet he's seen leaning over Alexander at the momen of his death, as are others, when Ptolemy's own writing stated that he died with only Ptolemy and Bagoas in the room. As for Kassandros, he was, briefly, in Babylon when Alexander died, but as he was not allowed anywhere near the King (let alone in his bedchamber), it was rumoured that he had his younger brother, Iolus, Alexander's cup-bearer, poison Alexander just as he was starting to recover from his fever. Another serious inaccuaracy is about Darius, whom Alexander so easily conquered: Darius never took the field against Alexander--not in the way one usually thinks. The Persians were so firmly entrenched in power and Darius so amused at the notion of being conquered by a boy, he did nothing till it was too late, and when he did go to war it was in a golden chariot, in which he ran in terror from Alexander's approach on both ocassions they came near to one another. He was also lazy and cowardly--his army traveled with his entire household, wives, concubines, eunuchs--that he was no match for Alexander's light-horsed, light-marching speed. The two never even saw one another due to Darius' flight, leaving his mother and wife to their fates. Luckily for the women, Alexander was respectful, sequestered them, keeping them safe, and in fact became close to Darius' mother, Sisygambis, (who was the one to mistake Hephastion, the taller, more ""regal"" figure, and it was to her that Alexander said, ""You were right, Mother, he is Alexander, too."") When Alexander died, Sisygambis turned her face to the wall and starved herself to death out of grief, while her own son's death she met with contempt due to his cowardice. The scene where we see the Persian women surrounded by men from Alexander's army is outrageous: Persian women were so modest that they never saw or spoke to strange men, and Alexander never subjected them to such scrutiny--he was famous for his incredible respect for the women, even the Persian ones, under his care. It's believed that he had in mind to reunite Darius with his wife, as a peace offering and gesture of respect. If it had been Stone's idea to reveal the man to us, it would have been through such acts that we could have gotten to know him, not through battle scenes.Alexander's beloved horse's name isn't even pronounced correctly! Boukephalos, not Bucephalos--the ""c"" is hard, not soft, and it seems to me that an ""historical"" film should have some notion of such details. And in Macedonian, he was called ""Oxhead""; Bukephalos is Greek, and Alexander mostly spoke his native tongue with his friends and his army.Alexander was a man so wounded, so powerful, so beautiful, so intense in his need to excel, so driven, so loyal, so hungry for power but not for the sake of power, but for the sake of glory. Like Achilles, whom he quoted often, he had chosen between glory and length of days. That this movie shows none of that glory, none of the love he felt for those whose trust he had implicit, none of his sense of justice, is sad and wasteful. Stone claims to have read Mary Renault's Alexander historical novels, yet clearly didn't understand anything of them. If anyone wants to learn who Alexander really was, reading ""The Fire from Heaven,"" ""The Persian Boy"" and ""The Nature of Alexander,"" and to learn the details that followed his death in ""Funeral Games,"" would be a better place to start than this mess of a movie.",1,Even worse than the critics said,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,11755,"['can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'truly', 'capturing',

910459,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0009PLLN6,Trevor Willsmer,"[8, 11]","The theatrical version of Alexander is not the total disaster it's been painted, more an interesting failure with moments that aspire to greatness nestled amid others that look too much like a Hallmark miniseries for comfort. Unfortunately, it lacks a particularly good script: indeed, where there's overlap between them, Robert Rossen's somewhat underfunded 1955 film dealt with key events much more dramatically and without recoursing to excessive narration to fill in the gaps. What it lacks even more is a real star as Alexander, a part that requires either great screen presence or a great actor. Sadly the blandly inoffensive Colin Farrell is neither. He tries hard (which is much more than can be said for Clive Owen in King Arthur) and he's almost convincing in the two action scenes, but he never sells you as an extraordinary man people will follow across the known world.And then, of course, there's the supporting cast, Val Kilmer occasionally channelling Robert Newton's Long John Silver, Angelina Jolie coming across like Irene Papas on steroids (not to mention with added collagen) and Anthony Hopkins looking for another bit of scenery to chew on. (On a purely trivial note it's strange to note how much Rory McCann looks like either a young Sean Connery or a middle-aged Victor Argo depending on what angle he's photographed from.) Although there's a method to his madness, it's hard not to think Stone is taking the Mick with all the Celtic accents and at times its surprisingly difficult to decipher what is being said, more because of mumbling and slurred pronunciation than the regional dialect, to be fair.There's intelligence at work here, as witnessed by the cave scene where the terrible price of greatness among the mythological heroes Alexander idolises is outlined, but often more in intent than execution. When it does work, it works well - the bloody battle of Guagamela seen intermittently from an eagle's eye view, the scenes in a gorgeously realized Babylon - but all too often there's too little of what made Alexander great. Indeed, there's too little of everything despite its running time. Relationships aren't convincingly sketched out and the big dramatic scenes are clumsily executed and emotionally uninvolving: his scenes with his mother or the fatal argument with Cleitus just show up the inadequacies of the cast and lack power or focus. Stone's tendency to idealize Alexander doesn't help, even if his script acknowledges the fact. For all his talk of being driven by a dream, it's never really communicated what that dream was beyond a desire for personal glory and a place among the immortals, nor does he deal with the fact that Alexander left no legacy but chaos. As a result, the last hour, when things start to go bad for Al, gets duller than it needs to be. Still, Vangelis' score is excellentIt's strange that so many American critics focused on the bisexuality: in truth, it's one of the LEAST gay sword-and-sandals epics, simply avoiding all the euphemisms to deal with it head-on. That said, I could have done without Farrell flittering his eyelids like a little girl ever time he's with Hephaistion.",2,Alexander the not nearly Great Enough,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,3156,"['theatrical', 'version', 'Alexander', 'not', 'total', 'disaster', 'been', 'painted', 'more', 'interesting', 'failure', 'moments', 'aspire', 'greatness', 'nestled', 'others', 'look', 'too', 'much', 'Hallmark', 'miniseries', 'comfort', 'Unfortunately', 'particularly', 'good', 'script', 'indeed', 'where', 'overlap', 'Robert', 'Rossen', 'somewhat', 'underfunded', '1955', 'film', 'dealt', 'key', 'events', 'much', 'more', 'dramatically', 'recoursing', 'excessive', 'narration', 'fill', 'gaps', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'real', 'star', 'Alexander', 'part', 'great', 'screen', 'presence', 'great', 'actor', 'Sadly', 'blandly', 'inoffensive', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'neither', 'hard', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'King', 'Arthur', 'almost', 'convincing', 'two', 'action', 'scenes', 'never', 'extraordinary', 'man', 'people', 'will', 'follow', 'known', 'world.And', 'then', 'course', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'occasionally', 'channelling', 'Robert', 'Newton', 'Long', 'John', 'Silver', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'coming', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'steroids', 'not', 'mention', 'added', 'collagen', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'looking', 'bit', 'scenery', 'chew', 'purely', 'trivial', 'note', 'strange', 'note', 'how', 'much', 'Rory', 'McCann', 'young', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'middle-aged', 'Victor', 'Argo', 'depending', 'what', 'photographed', 'method', 'madness', 'hard', 'not', 'think', 'Stone', 'taking', 'Mick', 'Celtic', 'accents', 'times', 'surprisingly', 'difficult', 'decipher', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'more', 'mumbling', 'slurred', 'pronunciation', 'regional', 'dialect', 'be', 'intelligence', 'work', 'here', 'witnessed', 'cave', 'scene', 'where', 'terrible', 'price', 'greatness', 'mythological', 'heroes', 'Alexander', 'idolises', 'outlined', 'often', 'more', 'intent', 'execution', 'When', 'work', 'well', 'bloody', 'battle', 'Guagamela', 'seen', 'intermittently', 'eagle', 'eye', 'view', 'scenes', 'gorgeously', 'realized', 'Babylon', 'too', 'often', 'too', 'little', 'what', 'made', 'Alexander', 'great', 'Indeed', 'too', 'little', 'everything', 'running', 'time', 'Relationships', 'are', ""n't"", 'convincingly', 'sketched', 'out', 'big', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'are', 'clumsily', 'executed', 'emotionally', 'uninvolving', 'scenes', 'mother', 'fatal', 'argument', 'Cleitus', 'just', 'show', 'up', 'inadequacies', 'cast', 'lack', 'power', 'focus', 'Stone', 'tendency', 'idealize', 'Alexander', ""n't"", 'help', 'even', 'script', 'fact', 'talk', 'being', 'driven', 'dream', 'never', 'really', 'communicated', 'what', 'dream', 'was', 'desire', 'personal', 'glory', 'place', 'immortals', 'deal', 'fact', 'Alexander', 'left', 'legacy', 'chaos', 'result', 'last', 'hour', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'bad', 'Al', 'duller', 'be', 'Still', 'Vangelis', 'score', 'excellentIt', 'strange', 'so', 'many', 'American', 'critics', 'focused', 'bisexuality', 'truth', 'one', 'LEAST', 'gay', 'sword-and-sandals', 'epics', 'simply', 'avoiding', 'euphemisms', 'deal', 'head-on', 'said', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Farrell', 'flittering', 'eyelids', 'little', 'girl', 'ever', 'time', 'Hephaistion']",Alexander

I thought it would be full of Hollywood tripe. For those of you who either don't know or don't want to admit the facts, Alexander the Great was an incredibly tough homosexual man who conquored most of the known world during his time. He was an amazing man who overthrew wicked dicators much more bloodthirsty than he was, and he brought peace and prosperity to much of his lands for a time.The fact he was a homosexual is VERY important...because his most elite army was also homosexual. The bonds and love and lust and life these men shared helped lead them to their victories. Oliver Stone did a superb job in portraying Alexander as 'bisexual', which is ok, because Alexander as King did have an obligation to marry and procreate. And I'm sure he loved his wife, but not in the same way he loved his life partner, best friend, and male lover, Hephaestion. Stone did a remarkable job in helping to bring this love into the light.Apart from Alexander's sexuality, there is a wealth of characters and influences and causes and passions surrounding his life which do make a very compelling story. This is a wonderful movie, tasteful and extremely well done. Yes, it could have been better...and it might be boring to homophobes who can't get over historical fact.

And that's the reason for the accent of Val Kilmer (Phillip II) but not in the case of Alexander, educated by a Greek tutor, Aristotle, who is supposed to speak ""pure"" Greek, without the Macedonian or Epirote dialectal variant.Good movie, first time I see ancient Greeks dressed as ancient Greeks (and ancient Persians dressed as ancient Persians), and dwell in real ancient Greek, Babylonian and Persian cities.

910464,A1H5E7O5BW2J13,B0009PLLN6,V.C.,"[6, 8]","The first time i heard about Alexander the Great was through my world history teacher, who has such a passionate and personal affinity with him and what he did and stands for. I borrowed a book about Alexander and was very interested in the life of this extraordinary and legendary human being. Whether people agree or not, Alexander has changed the world in more ways than we can imagine, probably in more ways than any man that has changed the course of history (for his time). However, this movie doesn't show that. I first saw Alexander at the movie theatre, and most likely i will never borrow it or rent it even if somebody gave it to me for free! Here are the things that i found wrong with this movie:1) Collin Farrel. Let's face it, just because he bleached his hair blonde and wears Roman armor doesn't mean that he makes a good Alexander. For one, the main problem is that he's not CONVINCING enough. How in the world are we supposed to believe that this man was a strong and powerful leader while for the most part in this movie we see him crying and hugging up on his soldiers? How are we supposed to believe that his soldiers will DIE for Alexander during battle when we aren't even convinced that he's actually a great leader? Do we actually care about Alexander during the battle itself? Collin as Alexander was just so bland and uninspiring, i thought the boy who played the young Alexander did much better acting.2) The chronology of events: Okay, let's be a bit more realistic here, apparently Oliver Stone didn't intend to be very precise or historically accurate. But if you are going to make a movie about an actual person and actual events that not everybody is going to know about, i think it's best to be sure that the events correlate with one another and are clear and concise. It seemed kind of random that in the middle of the film they make a flashback of when Alexander's father died. Why couldn't they have done that in the beginning when it actually happened? I just felt as if in the last minute Oliver Stone thought ""oh wait, I forgot to add this scene..."" and just randomly put it in the film regardless of how confusing and awkward it would be for the audience.3) The ""homosexuality"" issue: For one, yes, Alexander was gay. However, it just seemed pretty silly and ridiculous that in this movie ""homosexuality"" seems to be defined or represented by how much a man hugs another man. Not that i was expecting there to be sex scenes from Queer as Folk in ancient times, but c'mon, why not portray the man's homosexuality in more ways than him just hugging and crying over a man?4) Messy action scenes: Okay, yes, none of us can even imagine how bloody war was back then in the ancient world. But extremely rough and bloody doesn't have to equate to messy and ridiculous fighting scenes. The battle scenes were just way too over the top and cluttered to be exciting let alone interesting. And in some scenes i thought it was either too cheesy, or just way too long and boring. It didn't leave you cheering on for Alexander or for his men, it just makes you wish that everybody would die already so we can move on.5) The acting: HORRIBLE. I think the only great cast from this movie was Angelina Jolie. Sure, her accent was kind of strange and not very good, but that woman is sexy as hell, regardless she pulled off her role very well.6) The dialogue: Very bland and uninspiring.7) Too Much Detail: First of all, not too many people can explain the life of Alexander in one book let alone in one movie. I think one of the flaws of this movie that it tries to cram in too much history too quickly, where it comes to the point where we just don't really care about the main character. And i think that's what this movie SHOULD have done, but doesn't really do that.So all in all, this whole movie was just a big mess. The timing was bad, the acting is bad, and the whole film itself is just very inconsistent and so uninspiring. I don't understand why this movie is rated R other than the reason that we see Rasio Darson expose herself while threatening to cut Alexander's head off. And even that scene seemed unnecessary and pointless, just an attempt to give the movie an R rating. The biggest flaw of all i believe though is Collin Farrel for making Alexander very dull, uninspiring, and uninteresting, and also for Oliver Stone's lack of actually making us CONNECT with this legendary, immortal like character.",1,"Could Have Done Well, But It Didnt.",1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,4445,"['first', 'time', 'i', 'heard', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'was', 'world', 'history', 'teacher', 'who', 'passionate', 'personal', 'affinity', 'what', 'did', 'stands', 'borrowed', 'book', 'Alexander', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'life', 'extraordinary', 'legendary', 'human', 'being', 'people', 'agree', 'not', 'Alexander', 'changed', 'world', 'more', 'ways', 'can', 'imagine', 'probably', 'more', 'ways', 'man', 'changed', 'course', 'history', 'time', 'However', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'first', 'saw', 'Alexander', 'movie', 'theatre', 'most', 'likely', 'i', 'will', 'never', 'borrow', 'rent', 'even', 'somebody', 'gave', 'free', 'Here', 'are', 'things', 'i', 'found', 'wrong', 'movie:1', 'Collin', 'Farrel', 'Let', 'face', 'just', 'bleached', 'hair', 'blonde', 'wears', 'Roman', 'armor', ""n't"", 'mean', 'good', 'Alexander', 'one', 'main', 'problem', 'not', 'CONVINCING', 'enough', 'How', 'world', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'man', 'was', 'strong', 'powerful', 'leader', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'see', 'crying', 'hugging', 'up', 'soldiers', 'How', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'soldiers', 'will', 'DIE', 'Alexander', 'battle', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'convinced', 'actually', 'great', 'leader', 'Do', 'actually', 'care', 'Alexander', 'battle', 'Collin', 'Alexander', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'bland', 'uninspiring', 'i', 'thought', 'boy', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'Alexander', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'acting.2', 'chronology', 'events', 'Okay', 'let', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'realistic', 'here', 'apparently', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'be', 'very', 'precise', 'historically', 'accurate', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'actual', 'person', 'actual', 'events', 'not', 'everybody', 'going', 'know', 'i', 'think', 'best', 'be', 'sure', 'events', 'correlate', 'one', 'are', 'clear', 'concise', 'seemed', 'kind', 'random', 'middle', 'film', 'make', 'flashback', 'when', 'Alexander', 'father', 'died', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'beginning', 'when', 'actually', 'happened', 'just', 'felt', 'last', 'minute', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'thought', 'oh', 'wait', 'forgot', 'add', 'scene', 'just', 'randomly', 'put', 'film', 'regardless', 'how', 'confusing', 'awkward', 'would', 'be', 'audience.3', 'homosexuality', 'issue', 'one', 'yes', 'Alexander', 'was', 'gay', 'However', 'just', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'silly', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'homosexuality', 'be', 'defined', 'represented', 'how', 'much', 'man', 'man', 'Not', 'i', 'was', 'expecting', 'there', 'be', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'ancient', 'times', ""c'mon"", 'why', 'not', 'portray', 'man', 'homosexuality', 'more', 'ways', 'just', 'hugging', 'crying', 'man', '4', 'Messy', 'action', 'scenes', 'Okay', 'yes', 'none', 'can', 'even', 'imagine', 'how', 'bloody', 'war', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'ancient', 'world', 'extremely', 'rough', 'bloody', ""n't"", 'have', 'equate', 'messy', 'ridiculous', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'cluttered', 'be', 'exciting', 'let', 'alone', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'either', 'too', 'cheesy', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'cheering', 'Alexander', 'men', 'just', 'wish', 'everybody', 'would', 'die', 'already', 'can', 'move', 'on.5', 'acting', 'HORRIBLE', 'think', 'only', 'great', 'cast', 'movie', 'was', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Sure', 'accent', 'was', 'kind', 'strange', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'woman', 'sexy', 'hell', 'regardless', 'pulled', 'off', 'role', 'very', 'well.6', 'dialogue', 'Very', 'bland', 'uninspiring.7', 'Too', 'Much', 'Detail', 'First', 'all', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'explain', 'life', 'Alexander', 'one', 'book', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'movie', 'think', 'one', 'flaws', 'movie', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'history', 'too', 'quickly', 'where', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'main', 'character', 'i', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'done', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'that.So', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'big', 'mess', 'timing', 'was', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'whole', 'film', 'just', 'very', 'inconsistent', 'so', 'uninspiring', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'other', 'reason', 'see', 'Rasio', 'Darson', 'expose', 'threatening', 'cut', 'Alexander', 'head', 'even', 'scene', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'pointless', 'just', 'attempt', 'give', 'movie', 'R', 'rating', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'i', 'believe', 'Collin', 'Farrel', 'making', 'Alexander', 'very', 'dull', 'uninspiring', 'uninteresting', 'also', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'lack', 'actually', 'making', 'CONNECT', 'legendary', 'immortal', 'character']",Alexander

910466,A31D8QKJXU93BT,B0009PLLN6,"Vince Perrin ""Byline""","[6, 8]","This Director's Cut DVD rates its three stars because Oliver Stone is incapable of being non-controversial, it's an epic view of an epic life, it's a full nine minutes shorter than the original (truly), and because so many wrong-headed reviews have appeared here and elsewhere that it qualifies as victim or  underdog, either of which earns some sympathy. Otherwise, ""Alexander"" might be starless, not for its askewed history or card-shuffle editing but for the wasted opportunity it represents.Baz Lurhman, the Austrailan director, is planning his own take on Alexander with Leonardo DiCaprio. It can only be better. Last year's ""Troy,"" for that matter, was better, even though it turned the legendary anger of Achilles into petulance and his male lover into a cousin (Stone gets credit for not dodging that issue.)Colin Farrell as Alexander and Angelina Jolie as his scheming mother are pretty but clearly miscast. Val Kilmer fares better as his rabid father but the script undermines him, as it does everyone. Robin Lane Fox, the definitive biographer of Alexander, was a consultant, but Stone must have stoned him. Two combat sequences, one featuring an eagle's overview and the other costumed elephants, are edited so ineptly it's hard to know what's happening, which doesn't much matter because Alexander never lost a battle. Anthony Hopkins' on and off-screen narration throughout helps somewhat.For this two-disc DVD, Stone says he cut some of the ""gayness"" over which critics and homophobes have chortled. In fact, in his original there was nothing overt, just the suggestion that Alexander was bisexual, as was customary at the time. Even that little was too much for some; others complained it wasn't enough. Unless you show naked people fornicating, filmmakers are accused of avoiding human sexuality. Cameras used to pan away and scenes dissolve after the first kiss. Not any more; today the actors are just getting started.Subtlety is usually a stranger to Stone, but the very idiosyncracies that favor this director go against him here. Farrell and his pals have lilting Irish accents, Jolie utters (there's no other word for her speech) an ersatz Balkan, Kilmer barks Americanese, and everyone else speaks brittle British. When Alexander enters Babylon, you half expect to encounter the Tower of Babel.What could this bold and, yes, exciting director have been thinking to tackle a subject of such complexity and magnitude? Ancient history is far from the contemporary terrain he walks so well (""Wall Street,"" ""JFK,"" the Vietnam trilogy).

I just watched it and am at somewhat at a loss why everyone says it was so terrible.Actually, I quite enjoyed it. I thought Colin Farrell did a very credible job of acting as did, actually, the entire cast. I thought the battle scenes were pretty well done, if that's what you're interested in, the homosexuality wasn't glossed over though it was not made a big issue either (nor should it have been). This is a movie about a conflicted man who did some marvelous things and did some terrible things. He was (like most of us) a product of his environment and of his upbringing.I don't know...I liked the movie.  I have to suspect it may have suffered some backlash from ""Troy"". Now, that was DULL.I guess all I can say is try to approach this with an open mind and make your own decision on this. I feel too often that we take a critics opinion as the word of god when in reality it is just one persons opinion. I, personally, enjoy big spectacle movies and this one does the job handily. Also, I feel the story was handled well and the character development was not neglected. All the characters were multidimensional and, I thought, quite believable.  Initially, I thought to myself that there sure were a lot of different accents going on and then it occured to me that in the reality of Alexanders world that was probably also the case. I mean, they all came from different places, didn't they? So I let the accents pass. Again, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. Give it a try.

I didn't expect it to be good, and yet I knew I had to see it anyway. What's strange is that in some ways it's hard to put a finger on why it fell so flat. There are some obvious things, like casting Colin Farrell, like all the Celtic accents and like Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother, with a rather bizarre accent of her own. There's the awkward effort to make this relevant to our times. It's hard not to look at Darius and not see some sort of Middle Eastern terrorist type. And then when Alexander chooses to chase him through the Hindu Kush in a guerilla war it's too close a parallel to Bin Laden at Tora Bora to dismiss. I know this is true to the events, but it's a problem when a filmmaker seems to want to sell his project by appealing to our very contemporary political prejudices. But still, none of these are what was disappointing to me. It's okay to take issue with a film if it has some life, but this one didn't.I couldn't even really get outraged by how bad it was. Troy had me aghast at how the filmmakers butchered The Iliad. King Arthur was laughable in its earnestness to totally rewrite Arthurian lore. I didn't like those films at all, but there was almost something enjoyable about how bad they were. That's not the case here. It's clear that Oliver Stone took himself very seriously here. He wanted to make a big, important film, and never admits throughout this that this is really kitsch entertainment. That's the failure. A bad film that sort of pokes you in the ribs playfully is one thing, but when you want people to seriously be moved by actors with inappropriate accents, bad hair dye jobs, grandiose and contradictory proclamations...

910469,A6AT9WIGOXKRP,B0009PLLN6,"Whipple McTeelson the Third ""Purveryor of Mad...","[6, 32]","He's released four or seven versions of this movie.  At what point can't somebody just go to the man and take it out of his hands, lead him far far away from the project and put him in front of a screen showing all the classic movies he did direct.This is an albatross for Mr. Stone.  He's shackled to this movie and somebody must set him free.  He's not the first director to helm a movie that went off the rails and got completely away from him and he won't be the last.  Granted, this movie came out after Gladiator when every two-bit director got saddled with a horse, sword and sandal flick.  It was like a bad case of delirium swept tinseltown and these fools staggered around foaming at the mouth coming up with their own rendition of men riding horse whacking each other's heads clean off.  Troy.  Last Samurai.  All those relentless Lord of the Rings.  It bit Ridley Scott so bad he ripped his own self off and directed Kingdom of Heaven as a pale imitation of all the other pale imitators imitating his own work that set the stage for it.But how it bit Oliver Stone is beyond me.  He's entire oeuvre, if I shall deign myself to use such a word-is in contemporary themes.  He was lost the moment he picked up the screenplay (if there ever was one-I figure they likely was but I think it was more a stack of storyboards and it may have as likely started out as a movie based on Marco Polo or Ghengis Kahn but with a switch of a sticky note it turned into Alexander The Great.)The thing is a horrid hot mess of a movie.  The less said the better.  All I can say is I was glad I avoided the spectacle when it came out and waited 3 maybe 6 years when I got the scratched up dvd at a dvd used store that was unloading a stack of these movies that were dumped off by some flunky from the corner dvd rental store for 50cents on the dollar.  I got it figuring the only thing I could lose was 3.5 hours of my life and 3.5 dollars.  Boy was I sorely mistaken.  I lost a twinge bit of my soul.  Maybe it was from all the bad accents from everybody in the movie.  Even the deaf mute boy struggled with his accent.Yet Ollie went ahead and kept releasing semi-annual director's cuts, extended cuts, extended director cuts like clockwork.  at least clockwork as done by a mad hatter with mercury seeping deep into the cranium.  I figured Ollie checked himself into rehab because of this movie when he went clean and sober from anymore tinkering.  Now this.  Obviously he's been locked in a room with kleenex boxes for shoes working on one more sorely unnecessary version of this movie to inflict on society.But if you liked this movie (all 317 of you) then knock yourself out and splurge!",1,"No, Please Oliver.

910472,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B0009PLLN6,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[1, 1]","This is absurd. There are three versions of this film, and each should have a separate set of reviews. Come on, Amazon. Is it so difficult to do this? This is a review of the Blu-ray ""Alexander Revisited"".The original cut of ""Alexander"" was controversial for a single reason... Oliver Stone refused to hide the fact that homosexual behavior was common among the Greeks (usually an older man with a younger). * It's okay to show people having their guts ripped out, but don't you dare show two intimate friends (Alexander and Hephaestion) pledging their life-long loyalty, or a man kissing a eunuch (Bagoas), then having sex with him. And although there are several stories about why Philip was murdered, Stone uses the one in which a young man, a member of his bodyguard and Philip's occasional lover, ** takes revenge when Philip fails to do anything about the young man's rape by other men.There is also a scene in which the young Alexander is told by Aristotle that women aren't worth loving, and that sex between men -- if it is not simply out of lust, but for the purpose of character development -- is a worthy thing. That must have gotten a lot of viewers' whities tightened.The real problems with ""Alexander"" stem from Stone's desire to present a drama, not just an historical epic. Though ancient writers reported Alexander's personality as a mixture of great ambition, high intelligence, and a sometimes uncontrollable rashness, Stone fails to present these in any coherent fashion. Alexander is portrayed as torn between love for Philip (who alternates between love and a refusal to acknowledge him as heir (whether because he believes the child a bastard, or he didn't want a half-Macedonian heir from Olympias, isnt clear)), and his mother, who's constantly pressing him to Do Great Things.The biggest failing of the script, however, is providing a clear reason for Alexander's heavy drinking and ""seduction"" by Eastern culture. The result is that a film that's supposed to illuminate one of the most-important people in history leaves us with more questions than we started with.An even bigger failing is Stone's disastrous casting of Colin Farrell -- who badly wanted to play the part -- as Alexander. Whatever one might think of Farrell's thespic skills, he is in totally over his head. (The blonde wig -- why is Alexander always portrayed as blonde? It looks stupid. -- doesn't help.)There is no question about Alexander's charisma. (He would have /had/ to been charismatic to command the loyalty of so many men for so long, especially as he shaved his beard, a no-no among Greek males. ***) Farrell gets this very well. It's the subtle moments that don't come off.Whenever he's disturbed or unhappy or confused, his face takes on the same sappy expression, shaking and twitching to no particular end, other than demonstrating that he can over-emote. The scenes in which he confronts his mother range from incompetent to embarrassing.The scene in which he bids farewell to the dying Hephaestion is particularly bad. It's perfectly fine for Alexander to cry as he tries to comfort the person he best loves, but Farrell shows an unmanly lack of control. And the little speech in which he tells Hephaestion of all the wonderful things that remain to be done, as he looks out to the world, should have been something quite grand, quite stirring, but Farrell doesn't get much further than reading the lines.Farrell is the right physical age for Alexander, but not the right emotional age. I remember a hetero guy in college -- not even 20 -- telling me how, when his best friend had died, he had cried himself to sleep for a month. Colin Farrell has either never experienced anything like this, or if he has, cannot convey it in his acting. He fails to bring those elements that would have at least partly compensated for the script's omissions.Ultimately, an actor's failure can and should be blamed on the director, especially when the director does the casting. For a director such as Oliver Stone, who commands the complexities of such a huge film so effortlessly, this failure is remarkable. How he could have shot himself in the foot is hard to understand.Nevertheless, ""Alexander Revisited"" is worth seeing, especially for the generally good script and fine performances from almost everyone but Farrell. (I had some initial problems with Val Kilmer as Philip, as we usually associate Kilmer with youthful roles, but it's an okay performance.)Visually, ""Alexander Revisited"" is stunning. I've seen the DVD on a 36"" flat-face Sony, and this Blu-ray on a 60"" Kuro, and there is no comparison whatever. It's one of those rare films -- such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""2001"" -- that do not come across well on anything less than a large display.* Contrast ""Troy"", in which Patroclus was turned from Achilles' younger-warrior-lover -- into his cousin! Good grief.** The question of whether Philip had sexual relations with adult men -- uncommon in the Greek world -- is an interesting one. As his bodyguards would presumably have been old enough to be bearded, having sex with one of them would have been considered a bit odd -- though the rest of the Greek world viewed Macedonians as kinda strange, one contemporary writer stating that Macedonian men would freely allow other men to mount them. Stone shows bearded men who are roughly Philip's contemporaries hugging him and wrapping their arms around his shoulders, familiarities it seems odd for a king to permit. I presume Stone's implication is that these are men Philip is or was having sexual relations with.*** Though he supposedly had a scanty beard, this is likely because he wanted to preserve the illusion -- at least for Hephaesition -- that he remained a ""beardless youth"". This, in turn, suggests other things I won't go into.",4,"It could have been not just good, but ""Alexander"" the great.",1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,5806,"['absurd', 'are', 'three', 'versions',

910473,A1QF10TB8AYTA3,B0009PLLN6,"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja""","[3, 6]","For the longest time. I was curious as to why Alexander the Great was panned by critics and audiences. After all, it was being directed by Oliver Stone and had some strong, star power backing it. My curiosity had to be satiated and in the end I lost 3 hours of could have been doing something else.So before you, dear viewer dare to challenge yourself into watching this movie. Let's break down where it fails, perhaps sway you to turn back now.1.) It was off to a promising start. Anthony Hopkins set up the scene and made me curious as to how this adventure was going to start. Another 20 minutes of rambling later, and I found myself wanting the movie to get on with it already! So here's your first problem: The movie prefers to TELL you what happened rather than show you. All the major campaigns that would have been wonderful to see on the screen are glossed over and talked about, rather than shown. The way this movie was edited together makes it difficult for the viewer to get invested in the characters.2.) Poor, poor, editing. I have no idea why in the world they decided to show the murder of Alexander's father until the last leg of the movie. The scene was a critical part in showing you WHY Alexander decided to go conquer some countries, but the viewer is left clueless for most of the movie. The way this movie was put together basically made it impossible to feel any empathy for the characters. You just don't care, because you don't get to know them well enough, which leads to the next problem.3.) Character development. What character development? You really don't get a sense for how the characters feel or get to know their personality. You can't really tell the generals apart except by their special effects make up. My biggest problem was Hephaiston. For someone who claims to have been in love with Alexander, he sure didn't seem too upset when Alex started taking wives and sleeping with other people. The character SHOULD HAVE GIVEN A DAMN or said something, or we should have seen of scene of him reacting negatively to it.Instead, he's forgotten about for chunks of the movie, brought in for some lines, disappears again, comes back, rinse and repeat. There is no development, no change, the character remains stagnant. Everything is just too segmented, and by the time the characters DO change and start to betray Alexander, you pretty much end up asking yourself, ""Who are you again?""4.) Collin Farrell was a terrible casting choice for Alexander, period. The way he looked in his armor, the way he chose to portray the character, the goofy faces he made in the movie, his oddly short stature. Completely failed to represent someone who is supposed to be a God among men. There was nothing inspiring about him, nothing that made ME want to follow him into battle, nothing that told me why this character would be great. Absolutely terrible acting, Angelina was a failure too. Her accent felt fake and she hammed it up throughout the whole movie. Oddly, Val Kilmer's Phillip was a more relatable and enjoyable character. He had depth and was portrayed fairly well, if only those other two followed his lead. Anthony Hopkins is more of a narrator, so he did his part fine.5.) When Alexander and Hephaiston had their ""moment"" in the balcony. It was one of the most cringe worthy acting scenes I've ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on. They didn't kiss or anything like that, the dialogue was just so, so bad. Youtube it if you're curious, but don't watch the movie because of it.6.) This is probably the most important part. The movie fails to make you CARE. You have all this rich material to create an incredible tale of an astonishing man. And instead, the movie just kind of prattles on and meanders.

From what I read on the ""Alexander"" IMDB boards, more people prefer the director's cut of the movie rather than the theatrical cut (and that's usually the case). Apparently, the DC is somewhat like the TC, except that it's eight minutes shorter, and switches scenes around to ""help the story flow better"". Hmm. So I thought to myself: ""I do like Oliver Stone's films (my favorite being JFK), and he really hasn't let me down yet"". IMDB's rating for Alexander is 5.5, but then again, I don't really trust IMDB's ratings, due to the fact that most users either vote a 1 or a 10, which explains how the Lord of the Rings trilogy is on the IMDB Top 250 films of all time list. I read RT, and they give Alexander a 14%, but then again, they allow anyone with a website to comment on movies. I also read that this is one film where you definitely WANT to ignore the critics on.WELL, I finally decided to give this film a chance, and rented this film (the director's cut version) last night. This movie was much better than the reviews I've read and heard said it would be. The action was completely believable. The effects were phenomenal during the battle scenes. As for historical epics, this movie was not as good as Gladiator or Braveheart, of course, but I still enjoyed this film.
