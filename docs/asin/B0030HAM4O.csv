1315432,A1KA5DU45IOZMV,B0030HAM4O,Morris G. Vescovi,"[2, 2]","This was the first DVD from Brazil that I ordered and I am very happy I did. The picture is very sharp, the sound is quite adequate and color is great. They had an original techniclor print for a master and the colors are very rich. The audio is in english, and the Portugese subtitles easily removed. The DVD also contains the original trailer. You don't need an all region player. This film has never been released here in the United States.Recent West Point graduate Lance Caldwell (Rock Hudson) is sent to Florida, his home, to help Major Degan (Richard Carlson) forceably remove the Seminoles lead by Chief Osceola from the ancient home land. They don't want to go and are resisting. Caldwell grew up with the Seminoles and knows they are not warlike and offers to try to talk to them. Degan tells him the time for talk is over and he is mounting an expedition to attack them.Caldwell also renews his relationship with Rever Muldoon (Barbara Hale) whom he loves and also wants to find out what happened to his best friend John Powell (Anthony Quinn). Both had been accepted to West Point and John whould have been the first Indian accepted to the Academy but on the day they were to leave John didn't show up and disappeared.Degan's expedition ends in a disaster. Only Degan and two other men escape. Caldwell is captured. Caldwell learns that Osceola is his friend John and John and Revere are in love. Osceola still wants peace and is tricked by Degan into coming to Fort Lincoln where he is immediatley imprisoned and beaten.This is a good solid western directed by Budd Boetticher with a great cast: Rock Hudson, Anthony Quinn, Barbara Hale, Richard Carlson, Lee Marvin and Hugh O'Brian. It also has some tough violent action and like many westerns from the 1950's a more adult plot and characters. My only complaint is that the movie deserved a bigger budget.",4,Good solid western and a very good DVD,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,1869,"['was', 'first', 'DVD', 'Brazil', 'ordered', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'did', 'picture', 'very', 'sharp', 'sound', 'quite', 'adequate', 'color', 'great', 'had', 'original', 'techniclor', 'print', 'master', 'colors', 'are', 'very', 'rich', 'audio', 'english', 'Portugese', 'subtitles', 'easily', 'removed', 'DVD', 'also', 'original', 'trailer', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'region', 'player', 'film', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'here', 'United', 'States.Recent', 'West', 'Point', 'graduate', 'Lance', 'Caldwell', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'sent', 'Florida', 'home', 'help', 'Major', 'Degan', 'Richard', 'Carlson', 'forceably', 'remove', 'Seminoles', 'lead', 'Chief', 'Osceola', 'ancient', 'home', 'land', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'are', 'resisting', 'Caldwell', 'grew', 'up', 'Seminoles', 'are', 'not', 'offers', 'try', 'talk', 'Degan', 'time', 'talk', 'over', 'mounting', 'expedition', 'attack', 'them.Caldwell', 'also', 'relationship', 'Rever', 'Muldoon', 'Barbara', 'Hale', 'whom', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'best', 'friend', 'John', 'Powell', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'had', 'been', 'accepted', 'West', 'Point', 'John', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'Indian', 'accepted', 'Academy', 'day', 'were', 'leave', 'John', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'disappeared.Degan', 'expedition', 'disaster', 'Only', 'Degan', 'two', 'other', 'men', 'escape', 'Caldwell', 'captured', 'Caldwell', 'Osceola', 'friend', 'John', 'John', 'Revere', 'are', 'love', 'Osceola', 'still', 'peace', 'tricked', 'Degan', 'coming', 'Fort', 'Lincoln', 'where', 'immediatley', 'imprisoned', 'beaten.This', 'good', 'solid', 'western', 'directed', 'Budd', 'Boetticher', 'great', 'cast', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Barbara', 'Hale', 'Richard', 'Carlson', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Hugh', ""O'Brian"", 'also', 'tough', 'violent', 'action', 'many', 'westerns', '1950', 'more', 'adult', 'plot', 'characters', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', 'deserved', 'bigger', 'budget']",N/A

1315434,A2ZU7RPVGBM1J8,B0030HAM4O,Roy M. Raffield,"[3, 3]","Here I should note that I enjoyed the movie, but it would have been better had it been more factual. One example is that the Second Seminole War was begun when an unscrupulous slave trader captured Osceola's favorite wife to make her a slave, and Osceola retaliated by burning down Fort King. Osceola was in fact betrayed under a flag of truce, but he was not killed by a competing chief at Fort King, which had been razed. He had been sent to Fort Moultrie in South Carolina, and he died of either malaria or yellow fever. On the other hand, the movie did get it right about his name being Billy Powell, and he was of mixed European and Creek Indian ancestry. Also, we should note that Seminole means breakaway or runaway, and the tribe was composed of a mixture of Creeks, Cherokees, and runaway slaves.Also, while not directly related to the movie, I will make a point, and this seems to be lost on Hollywood. The two most expensive Indian wars, in terms of blood and treasure, were fought in the Southeastern US, and they were the two Seminole and the Creek wars, respectively. Often this pitted whites and Indians that were friends against each other, and no matter which side it entailed, there was great remorse when a friend was killed in battle. Unfortunately, they were caught up in the throes of each's way of life trying to preserve itself.Roy M.
