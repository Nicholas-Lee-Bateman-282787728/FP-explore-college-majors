1398189,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B004EI2NPE,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","A French Gigolo might sound like this would be a sexy movie; in fact it is mostly the opposite. This is a film about missed opportunities and what might have been.Patrick is a male escort. The film opens with a very discreet meeting with Judith in a park; they appear to be strangers that just happen to meet. This is a critical moment, the film from the start asks, what if these two people hadn't met? The film then follows flips back and forth between the lives of Judith and Patrick. Several key characters break the fourth sound wall by directly addressing the audience with voice over narration. This film is not Pretty Woman but with the roles reversed - that was a glossy pretty Hollywood look at something that doesn't exist. Although there is a Pretty Woman influence on this film, Judith is very rich and beautiful in the Richard Gere mold, Patrick is handsome in a normal way - not Julia Roberts drop dead gorgeous mold.The French title, Client/e, gives a better sense of what this movie is about. In English Gigolo has a sense of care free fun about it. Client is more of a business relationship, the term used by prostitutes to describe the people that hire them (John would not have been a good word to use in the title). There is also a dual meaning in the French title - there are two clients, male and female. This is another key to the meaning of this film - who were the clients, Judith or Patrick? Gigolo has a lighter meaning in English - I don't think the director intended for anybody to think this is a light film.This might be viewed as slight spoilers for the film, so if you really don't want to know anything about the ending, please skip this paragraph. Judith never cries during the whole film. She says something about what could have been if they had been 20 or 30 years younger, and then starts crying. To me this was the key to the film. Everything was about what could have been, but wasn't. In the end, it is a dark film.Nathalie Baye as Judith is perfectly cast. She has aged so well, and it is easy to see her as a successfully rich woman that simply wants a younger man to pleasure her. She doesn't mind paying, and it is logical to her. I adored her sister Irene, her partner at the television show and neighbor. They have a wonderful chemistry. Patrick / Marco, &Eacute;ric Caravaca, is not a pretty boy, but more like the regular French guy that lives next door. It took some time, but I eventually liked him and understood why he did the things he did. Isabelle Carr&eacute; played Marco's wife, Fanny, she was at times pathetic with red eyes and other times incredibly beautiful.The film is not rated. The subject matter of male prostitution isn't dealt with in documentary style. It is glossy and not realistic. It is clear that Judith and Patrick have sex and then he is paid for the act. There is also a discreet sex scene between Marco and Fanny. Actually I don't think I ever saw any nudity other than Patrick's naked behind. The sex scenes would likely pass for 9PM prime time television, along with the naked bottom. There might be some strong language in the subtitles, I don't specifically remember much though. The subject matter probably means a mature viewer would be the right audience.The film is a touch on the long side at an hour and forty four minutes.This is a dark movie. It is not a happy film. It is not sexy. It does ask the question of what could have been.",4,What Could Have Been?,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,3426,"['French', 'Gigolo', 'might', 'sound', 'would', 'be', 'sexy', 'movie', 'fact', 'mostly', 'opposite', 'film', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been.Patrick', 'male', 'escort', 'film', 'very', 'discreet', 'meeting', 'Judith', 'park', 'appear', 'be', 'strangers', 'just', 'happen', 'meet', 'critical', 'moment', 'film', 'start', 'what', 'two', 'people', 'had', ""n't"", 'met', 'film', 'then', 'flips', 'back', 'forth', 'lives', 'Judith', 'Patrick', 'Several', 'key', 'characters', 'break', 'fourth', 'sound', 'wall', 'directly', 'addressing', 'audience', 'voice', 'narration', 'film', 'not', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'roles', 'reversed', 'was', 'glossy', 'pretty', 'Hollywood', 'look', 'something', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'influence', 'film', 'Judith', 'very', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'mold', 'Patrick', 'handsome', 'normal', 'way', 'not', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'mold.The', 'French', 'title', 'Client/e', 'better', 'sense', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'English', 'Gigolo', 'sense', 'care', 'free', 'fun', 'Client', 'more', 'business', 'relationship', 'term', 'used', 'prostitutes', 'describe', 'people', 'hire', 'John', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'word', 'use', 'title', 'also', 'dual', 'meaning', 'French', 'title', 'are', 'two', 'clients', 'male', 'female', 'key', 'meaning', 'film', 'who', 'were', 'clients', 'Judith', 'Patrick', 'Gigolo', 'lighter', 'meaning', 'English', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'director', 'intended', 'anybody', 'think', 'light', 'film.This', 'might', 'be', 'viewed', 'slight', 'spoilers', 'film', 'so', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'anything', 'ending', 'please', 'skip', 'paragraph', 'Judith', 'never', 'whole', 'film', 'something', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', '20', '30', 'years', 'younger', 'then', 'crying', 'was', 'key', 'film', 'Everything', 'was', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', ""n't"", 'end', 'dark', 'film.Nathalie', 'Baye', 'Judith', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'aged', 'so', 'well', 'easy', 'see', 'successfully', 'rich', 'woman', 'simply', 'younger', 'man', 'pleasure', ""n't"", 'mind', 'paying', 'logical', 'adored', 'sister', 'Irene', 'partner', 'television', 'show', 'neighbor', 'have', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'Patrick', '/', 'Marco', 'Eacute', 'ric', 'Caravaca', 'not', 'pretty', 'boy', 'more', 'regular', 'French', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'took', 'time', 'eventually', 'liked', 'understood', 'why', 'did', 'things', 'did', 'Isabelle', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'played', 'Marco', 'wife', 'Fanny', 'was', 'times', 'pathetic', 'red', 'eyes', 'other', 'times', 'incredibly', 'beautiful.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'subject', 'matter', 'male', 'prostitution', ""n't"", 'dealt', 'documentary', 'style', 'glossy', 'not', 'realistic', 'clear', 'Judith', 'Patrick', 'have', 'sex', 'then', 'paid', 'act', 'also', 'discreet', 'sex', 'scene', 'Marco', 'Fanny', 'Actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'saw', 'nudity', 'other', 'Patrick', 'naked', 'sex', 'scenes', 'would', 'likely', 'pass', '9PM', 'prime', 'time', 'television', 'naked', 'bottom', 'might', 'be', 'strong', 'language', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'remember', 'much', 'subject', 'matter', 'probably', 'mature', 'viewer', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'audience.The', 'film', 'touch', 'long', 'side', 'hour', 'forty', 'four', 'minutes.This', 'dark', 'movie', 'not', 'happy', 'film', 'not', 'sexy', 'ask', 'question', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been']",A French Gigolo
1398190,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B004EI2NPE,Doctor.Generosity,"[2, 4]","The film starts out as a ""saucy French comedy"" about a sophisticated businesswoman, played by the excellent Nathalie Baye, who hires younger men for sexual interludes while her middle aged sister hooks up with an American Indian. So far, a comedy. However, the director Balasko (who plays in the movie as the sister, with her real life husband as the Arizona Indian and her own daughter as the teenager) seems not to have been able to decide what kind of movie she was making. A third of the way through, she abandons comedy and the story morphs into a more serious drama about a French middle class family under severe financial stress, the heartrending breakdown of the gigolo's marriage when his secret is revealed, a disfunctional teenage girl, and the beginnings of a desperate love between escort and client as it all disintegrates. The viewer struggles to adjust to these changes in tone.Baye is the strongest character as a selfish, independent older woman who knows what she wants. Eric Caravaca as the gigolo does not seem to fit the part at all, more wimpy than sexy; I would find him more believable as a middle school math teacher than a bad boy. Their physical relationship seems devoid of passion, nor do they spark an emotional relationship. Film has good moments but overall suffers from poor architecture.Also Ms. Balasko centered this too much on her real life family; it's a vanity piece or even home movie. She seems a better actress than director.",3,Confused screenplay,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,1469,"['film', 'out', 'saucy', 'French', 'comedy', 'sophisticated', 'businesswoman', 'played', 'excellent', 'Nathalie', 'Baye', 'who', 'younger', 'men', 'sexual', 'interludes', 'middle', 'aged', 'sister', 'up', 'American', 'Indian', 'So', 'far', 'comedy', 'However', 'director', 'Balasko', 'who', 'movie', 'sister', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'Arizona', 'Indian', 'own', 'daughter', 'teenager', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'decide', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'was', 'making', 'third', 'way', 'comedy', 'story', 'morphs', 'more', 'serious', 'drama', 'French', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'severe', 'financial', 'stress', 'heartrending', 'breakdown', 'gigolo', 'marriage', 'when', 'secret', 'revealed', 'disfunctional', 'teenage', 'girl', 'beginnings', 'desperate', 'love', 'escort', 'client', 'disintegrates', 'viewer', 'adjust', 'changes', 'tone.Baye', 'strongest', 'character', 'selfish', 'independent', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'what', 'Eric', 'Caravaca', 'gigolo', 'not', 'seem', 'fit', 'part', 'more', 'wimpy', 'sexy', 'would', 'find', 'more', 'believable', 'middle', 'school', 'math', 'teacher', 'bad', 'boy', 'physical', 'relationship', 'devoid', 'passion', 'do', 'spark', 'emotional', 'relationship', 'Film', 'good', 'moments', 'overall', 'suffers', 'poor', 'architecture.Also', 'Ms.', 'Balasko', 'centered', 'too', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'family', 'vanity', 'piece', 'even', 'home', 'movie', 'better', 'actress', 'director']",A French Gigolo

1398193,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004EI2NPE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","There are so many appealing elements involved in the film ""A French Gigolo"" (also known as ""Cliente"") that I'm a bit conflicted.  While I enjoyed this puff pastry, I thought its uneven tone was off-putting.  Somewhere between a ribald comedy and a drama of emotional resonance and consequence, the film never really combines its disparate themes into a cohesive picture.  It's a shame, really, this had the potential to be challenging and thought provoking or hysterically funny--but, by riding the middle ground, it simply becomes a fairly amusing trifle.  Were it not for stars Nathalie Baye and Eric Caravaca, I might have been tempted to dismiss this altogether.  The two, however, are quite engaging and extremely likable and, in the end, they sell the film by providing a pleasing charm.Baye plays a home shopping network host who has been burned in past relationships so relies on paid entanglements for her physical needs.  Caravaca is one such paid escort.  Married and supporting his wife's family, he got into the business for strictly monetary reasons.  They are intrigued by one another, extend their professional relationship, and sometimes start blurring the lines.  Every character must face what he/she really wants and needs from this affair before the day is over--and everyone wants it on their own terms.  Baye wants the freedom of a paid escort with the intimacy of a real relationship.  Caravaca wants the experience with Baye but also loves his wife.  And his wife wants him not to see Baye but relishes the financial side of the relationship.  There are a lot of moral and emotional dilemmas to be sorted through, but the film has maintained such a frothy tone--I never really connected with moments of heartfelt drama.  It seems that the film endorses everyone's position and conflict in a politely accepting form.In the end, I'm not particularly sure anyone has learned anything.  But it's been a pleasant trip for the viewer.  Some moments of comedy work quite well--a lot at the studio is well observed and amusing.  But some things are simply ridiculous and distracting.  I pretty much hated the film's soundtrack.  Opening the film with a bad ballad from the eighties didn't seem prudent--but the gigolo rap (surely meant for irony or at least slapstick comic appeal) is absolutely dreadful and highlights exactly my point about the film's unevenness.  If you like lightweight French films or are a fan of Baye (and really, why wouldn't you be?), I'd still recommend the film.  Also of note, if you are checking this out for saucy and sexy fare due to the title--this is tame and mild by sex and nudity standards.  Pleasing, but forgettable.
