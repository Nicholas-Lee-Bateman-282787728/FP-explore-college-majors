Outside of that, this film is such a substandard clich&eacute;d mess that it becomes somewhat disheartening.  The acting on all fronts (outside of a chaotic Christopher Lloyd) is very good; even young Gamble being a nice find and the perfect Dennis, and yet the whole thing falls apart thanks to the thankless criminal backstory that takes away from the genuine nature and allure of the source material.The story revolves around young Dennis, who is left in the care of his neighbor George and his wife Martha when his parents go out of town.  George is a crotchety old man who loathes Dennis and his mischievous ways, but Martha is a kind old woman who nurtures and defends Dennis.  When a bubbling idiot of a convict named Switchblade Sam comes into town he sets his sights on the Wilson residence and soon he's face to face with young Dennis.It's kind of like John Hughs got lazy and decided to write `Home Alone' into the `Dennis the Menace' cartoons, and it just doesn't work.  Matthau may be effectively grouchy and Gamble may be undeniably adorable, but the film itself is a pointless and lazy mess and it does not hold up with repeat viewings because nothing feels even remotely original.

345293,AKVU4HUG6AN1U,6302914469,"""chick_flick""","[10, 10]","&quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, directed by Nick Castle, is based on the hit 60's sitcom, by the same title.PLOT SUMMARY: Mason Gamble stars as Dennis Mitchell, a young kid who just can't seem to stay out of trouble. He doesn't MEAN to cause trouble...he just well, does. Walter Matthau stars as Dennis's grumpy next door neighbor, Mr. Wilson, who can't STAND Dennis. When Dennis's parents go away (Robert Stanton and Lea Thompson), Dennis must stay with the Wilsons, and Mr. Wilson is extremely unhappy about this. But when Dennis gets out of line, Mr. Wilson gets so angry that he yells at Dennis, which makes Dennis run away. That's when the real trouble begins...Dennis encounters an old neighborhood thief, Switchblade Sam (Christopher Lloyd), who kidnaps Dennis, and soon Dennis learns that Switchblade Sam has stolen some items from the Wilsons' house (and others from his neighborhood), so it's up to Dennis to save the day.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I haven't seen this film in a long time, but I remember it well. The acting from the entire cast is great. The storyline is light-hearted and fun. Mason Gamble was a perfect choice for Dennis. The directing is wonderful, too.From the looks of the DVD, there is going to be some great special features. The bonus features will include a behind-the-scenes featurette, a documentary on Dennis the Menace, a special &quot;memories&quot; document with Mason Gamble, a conversation with Walter Matthau, and another conversation with writer and producer, John Hughes. The DVD will also include trailers and a DVD-ROM game.

There are also vintage interviews with John Hughes, Walter Mattheau, and Hank Ketchem, creator of the beloved cartoon series.  The extras also feature the 1993 television special that promoted the film!Then, of course, there is the film itself, which, to new veiwers, could just have easily have been made yesterday afternoon, as it has not aged in its first decade.

The kid they picked to play Dennis, what's his name, Mason Gamble, doesn't look or act anything like the Dennis Mitchell of the comic strip and the cartoons. He's just a cutesy cutesy little boy who acts like any five year old you'd see in a public preschool. He's appropriately named, because the film makers took a big gamble casting him ... and they lost. This flick was a commercial disappointment as I recall.Then of course you have Walter Matthau as Mr. Wilson. Matthau is interesting enough, and he's probably the best thing this lousy film has to offer. He's ... well ... adequate as Mr. Wilson.Finally, the big mystery... Christopher Lloyd. I've always been a big fan of his all the way back to his ""Taxi"" days, but would somebody please tell me just what in bloody hell the screen writers were thinking when they created his character in this thing? Switchblade Sam is a grimy knife wielding nutcase with rotten teeth who wonders into town to rob people's houses and ends up kidnapping Dennis. What the @$&%? I don't care who played his part. This character does NOT belong in a Dennis The Menace movie. There must have been a mistake. Apparently there was a horror film being made in another part of the studio, while this one was being produced. Maybe it was one of those Clive Barker flicks, and Chris was playing the same character in THAT thing. One day he must have just wondered onto the Dennis the Menace set by mistake, and the screenwriters hard up for material just approached him and asked ""Hey, we're struggling with our script. We need a villain in our movie. One that will attract audiences of all ages. You want to be in it?"" Any other self-respecting actor would have flat-out refused, but of course Lloyd hasn't exactly been Hollywood's sweetheart these last few years. He's a character actor with a ""Back to The Future"" stigma who when it comes to roles must catch as catch can. So, naturally he said yes, and here you have him. Completely out of place in a film that should have been shot with children in mind, but wasn't. I would never show this film to my kids. I'd be afraid that Christopher Lloyd would give them nightmares like he did to me when I first saw this movie.",1,Why does everyone love this movie?,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,2300,"['Dennis', 'Menace', 'indeed', 'think', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'menace', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'kid', 'picked', 'play', 'Dennis', 'what', 'name', 'Mason', 'Gamble', ""n't"", 'look', 'act', 'anything', 'Dennis', 'Mitchell', 'comic', 'strip', 'cartoons', 'just', 'cutesy', 'cutesy', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'five', 'year', 'old', ""'d"", 'see', 'public', 'preschool', 'appropriately', 'named', 'film', 'makers', 'took', 'big', 'gamble', 'casting', 'lost', 'flick', 'was', 'commercial', 'disappointment', 'recall.Then', 'course', 'have', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'Matthau', 'interesting', 'enough', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'lousy', 'film', 'offer', 'well', 'adequate', 'Mr.', 'Wilson.Finally', 'big', 'mystery', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'way', 'back', 'Taxi', 'days', 'would', 'somebody', 'please', 'tell', 'just', 'what', 'bloody', 'hell', 'screen', 'writers', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'created', 'character', 'thing', 'Switchblade', 'Sam', 'grimy', 'knife', 'wielding', 'nutcase', 'rotten', 'teeth', 'who', 'wonders', 'town', 'rob', 'people', 'houses', 'up', 'kidnapping', 'Dennis', 'What', '@', '%', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'character', 'NOT', 'belong', 'Dennis', 'Menace', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'mistake', 'Apparently', 'was', 'horror', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'part', 'studio', 'one', 'was', 'being', 'produced', 'Maybe', 'was', 'one', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'flicks', 'Chris', 'was', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'thing', 'One', 'day', 'must', 'have', 'just', 'wondered', 'Dennis', 'Menace', 'set', 'mistake', 'screenwriters', 'hard', 'up', 'material', 'just', 'approached', 'asked', 'Hey', ""'re"", 'struggling', 'script', 'need', 'villain', 'movie', 'One', 'will', 'attract', 'audiences', 'ages', 'want', 'be', 'other', 'self-respecting', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'flat-out', 'refused', 'course', 'Lloyd', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'sweetheart', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'character', 'actor', 'Back', 'Future', 'stigma', 'who', 'when', 'roles', 'must', 'catch', 'catch', 'can', 'So', 'naturally', 'said', 'yes', 'here', 'have', 'Completely', 'place', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'children', 'mind', 'was', ""n't"", 'would', 'never', 'show', 'film', 'kids', ""'d"", 'be', 'afraid', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'would', 'give', 'nightmares', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie']",N/A

It stars MASON GAMBLE, WALTER MATTHAU, LEA THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER LLOYD.As far as a family movie goes I give this FIVE STARS.. this means not only do I approve for the kids, but it is also a fun movie for ANYONE! It is rated PG, I think because CHRISTOPHER LLOYD plays a bandit and there are some scenes involving Dennis getting kidnapped, (the results are hillarious, I assure you.)There is a reference or two about Dennis' parents having sex but they will definatley fly over any childs head who isn't already well schooled in the subject matter. And come on! LEA THOMPSON is HOT as Mrs. Mitchell in this movie, there has to be at least one stab. Its something about how his parents ""wrestle"" on Sunday mornings and thats when they like to be left alone...no big deal.I found this movie to be very funny and so did the kids.
