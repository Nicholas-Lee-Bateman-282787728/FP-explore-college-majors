Apparently very few movie makers want to do a movie exclusively about older people (one example of how to do it well, The Bucket List) because here we have a silly side tale of romance and parental disapproval suddenly appearing. As if that weren't bad enough, it quickly begins to build romantic connections among the elders too, even a gay one (to make it up-to-date, I suppose).

1499391,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B005S9EJ46,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[1, 2]","Given the top quality cast in this film, I was relatively confident that a blind buy purchase of this Blu-ray (from another retailer, with apologies to my friends here at my favorite online retailer) was a worthwhile investment into something I hoped to be able to sit and enjoy watching with wife 2.0  Thankfully we weren't disappointed.After putting the disc in the player and seeing a couple of trailers for other films (The Descendants and We Bought a Zoo among those), I started playing this film and was immediately brought into a very brief introduction of the cast of characters that was going to be brought together on their adventures on where/how they'd spend the rest of their lives.Honestly, what happens to all of us as we age and get towards retirement is something I think we all somewhat fear, especially if we've not saved for our golden years.  In this particular film, we see a U.K. perspective on these events, with the various characters all basically forced into trying to stretch their limited resources because of a variety of circumstances.  In one case, it was due to investments, in another because of the death of a loved one.  Each member (or team) of the cast we're introduced seemed to have a different reason, but in the end, we knew that all would wind up at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, a promised life of luxury and opulence in beautiful India, where just a little money could be stretched a long, long way.Of course things are never quite what they seem and once the members of the party arrive in India they find the need to arrange alternate transport to get to their new home and even worse, once there they are greeted by a young man that is the Owner/Manager of a hotel that has certainly seen better days and is not the Best Exotic anything, at least not in the present time.  The Owner/Manager promises that better times are coming, plans for future improvements and expansion are very much on his mind, but getting there may take some time and for that he must beg for patience from his guests.Several events are set up early in the film that telegraph future situations and over the course of the film a viewer would, I expect, feel a strong sense of predictability and expectation.  Realistically, this is a film that does go where one expects.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a case of being hard to find surprise in, and for that I've lowered my rating a bit.  On the other hand, I would likely give this film a higher rating if it was possible to do so without giving what I would term a perfect mark.The performances were all top notch, and the introduction to life in India for those that aren't familiar with it is always interesting to me.  In that area, this film reminded me of the very nice filmOutsourced - Deluxe Edition(which inspired a forgettable NBC TV series).  I highly recommend that film and think it makes a decent companion piece to something like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  Others might lean more towardsSlumdog Millionaire [Blu-ray] which just so happens to feature a member of the cast of this same film.Anyway, this film did make for a decent nights entertainment for myself and my wife and I look forward to catching it later with some friends as well, meaning that I think there's some replay value here.  While the disc itself (in the Blu-ray packaging) is just the film, with no digital copy and no DVD included in the package, it was still worth the purchase price to me.  For others, perhaps waiting for the inevitable price drop is to be advised, but certainly this is a film worth putting on your own watch lists.",4,"A bit too predictable, but still very enjoyable",1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,3613,"['Given', 'top', 'quality', 'cast', 'film', 'was', 'relatively', 'confident', 'blind', 'buy', 'purchase', 'Blu-ray', 'retailer', 'apologies', 'friends', 'here', 'favorite', 'online', 'retailer', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'investment', 'something', 'hoped', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'wife', '2.0', 'Thankfully', 'were', ""n't"", 'disappointed.After', 'putting', 'disc', 'player', 'seeing', 'couple', 'trailers', 'other', 'films', 'Descendants', 'Bought', 'Zoo', 'started', 'playing', 'film', 'was', 'immediately', 'brought', 'very', 'brief', 'introduction', 'cast', 'characters', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'brought', 'together', 'adventures', 'where/how', ""'d"", 'spend', 'rest', 'lives.Honestly', 'what', 'age', 'get', 'towards', 'retirement', 'something', 'think', 'somewhat', 'fear', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'not', 'saved', 'golden', 'years', 'particular', 'film', 'see', 'U.K.', 'perspective', 'events', 'various', 'characters', 'basically', 'forced', 'trying', 'stretch', 'limited', 'resources', 'variety', 'circumstances', 'one', 'case', 'was', 'due', 'investments', 'death', 'loved', 'one', 'member', 'team', 'cast', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'seemed', 'have', 'different', 'reason', 'end', 'knew', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'promised', 'life', 'luxury', 'opulence', 'beautiful', 'India', 'where', 'just', 'little', 'money', 'could', 'be', 'stretched', 'long', 'long', 'way.Of', 'course', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'what', 'seem', 'once', 'members', 'party', 'arrive', 'India', 'find', 'need', 'arrange', 'alternate', 'transport', 'get', 'new', 'home', 'even', 'worse', 'once', 'are', 'greeted', 'young', 'man', 'Owner/Manager', 'hotel', 'certainly', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'not', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'anything', 'least', 'not', 'present', 'time', 'Owner/Manager', 'better', 'times', 'are', 'coming', 'future', 'improvements', 'expansion', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'mind', 'getting', 'there', 'may', 'take', 'time', 'must', 'beg', 'patience', 'guests.Several', 'events', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'early', 'film', 'future', 'situations', 'course', 'film', 'viewer', 'would', 'expect', 'feel', 'strong', 'sense', 'predictability', 'expectation', 'Realistically', 'film', 'go', 'where', 'one', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'case', 'being', 'hard', 'find', 'surprise', ""'ve"", 'lowered', 'rating', 'bit', 'other', 'hand', 'would', 'likely', 'give', 'film', 'higher', 'rating', 'was', 'possible', 'do', 'so', 'giving', 'what', 'would', 'term', 'perfect', 'mark.The', 'performances', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'introduction', 'life', 'India', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'always', 'interesting', 'area', 'film', 'reminded', 'very', 'nice', 'filmOutsourced', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'inspired', 'forgettable', 'NBC', 'TV', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'think', 'decent', 'companion', 'piece', 'something', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'Others', 'might', 'lean', 'more', 'towardsSlumdog', 'Millionaire', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'just', 'so', 'feature', 'member', 'cast', 'same', 'film.Anyway', 'film', 'did', 'make', 'decent', 'nights', 'entertainment', 'myself', 'wife', 'look', 'forward', 'catching', 'later', 'friends', 'well', 'meaning', 'think', 'replay', 'value', 'here', 'disc', 'Blu-ray', 'packaging', 'just', 'film', 'digital', 'copy', 'DVD', 'included', 'package', 'was', 'still', 'worth', 'purchase', 'price', 'others', 'perhaps', 'waiting', 'inevitable', 'price', 'drop', 'be', 'advised', 'certainly', 'film', 'worth', 'putting', 'own', 'watch', 'lists']",N/A
