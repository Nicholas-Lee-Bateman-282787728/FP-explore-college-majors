330600,A8MQW5B5QB3H1,6302732883,Kerry D,"[8, 9]","Judd Nelson is excellent as Joe Hunt in this true story about greed and murder amongst the rich and privileged of Los Angeles.Joe Hunt came from a poor family and was considered by his former ""privileged"" classmates as being nerdy, unpopular, and a scholarship kid.  After college, Joe became reacquainted with some of his rich former classmates through Dean Karny.  He convinced this group of guys that he was an expert in commodities trading and he had a ""risk free"" strategy that would produce big returns.  The guys were very impressed so they gave Joe all of their inheritances to invest in the commodities markets.  But instead of investing the money, Joe used their money to rent office space and hire employees for his new company, the Billionaire Boys Club.Joe scammed money from wealthy businessmen, spent some of the money to maintain his lavish lifestyle and the rest he lost in the commodities market.  And to keep his investors from getting suspicious, Joe mailed out fake statements that showed a small profit but eventually the investors started asking for their money back.  Joe was desperate to find new investors.Joe met Ron Levin, who was a wealthy businessman and con-artist himself.  He was hoping to scam Ron Levin out of enough money that he could bail out the BBC.  But as it turned out Ron scammed Joe.  Joe was furious and decided to kill Ron Levin.  Joe's biggest mistake was leaving a hand written ""to-do list"" at Ron's house.  The police found this list and later used it in court.  The prosecutor proclaimed, ""It's a recipe for murder"".In Joe's continual pursuit for more cash, a plot was hatched to kidnap Hedayat Eslaminia, a rich former Iranian official and hold him for ransom.  This plot didn't work either and Joe was losing control over the guys.  Two of the guys secretly went to the police and this led to the end of the BBC.Two especially good books were written about this story.  They are as follows:The Billionaire Boys Club by Sue HortonThe Price of Experience by Randall Sullivan",5,A recipe for murder,1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,2025,"['Judd', 'Nelson', 'excellent', 'Joe', 'Hunt', 'true', 'story', 'greed', 'murder', 'amongst', 'rich', 'privileged', 'Los', 'Angeles.Joe', 'Hunt', 'came', 'poor', 'family', 'was', 'considered', 'former', 'privileged', 'classmates', 'being', 'nerdy', 'unpopular', 'scholarship', 'kid', 'college', 'Joe', 'became', 'reacquainted', 'rich', 'former', 'classmates', 'Dean', 'Karny', 'convinced', 'group', 'guys', 'was', 'expert', 'commodities', 'trading', 'had', 'risk', 'free', 'strategy', 'would', 'produce', 'big', 'returns', 'guys', 'were', 'very', 'impressed', 'gave', 'Joe', 'inheritances', 'invest', 'commodities', 'markets', 'instead', 'investing', 'money', 'Joe', 'used', 'money', 'rent', 'office', 'space', 'hire', 'employees', 'new', 'company', 'Billionaire', 'Boys', 'Club.Joe', 'scammed', 'money', 'wealthy', 'businessmen', 'spent', 'money', 'maintain', 'lavish', 'lifestyle', 'rest', 'lost', 'commodities', 'market', 'keep', 'investors', 'getting', 'suspicious', 'Joe', 'mailed', 'out', 'fake', 'statements', 'showed', 'small', 'profit', 'eventually', 'investors', 'started', 'asking', 'money', 'back', 'Joe', 'was', 'desperate', 'find', 'new', 'investors.Joe', 'met', 'Ron', 'Levin', 'who', 'was', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'con-artist', 'was', 'hoping', 'scam', 'Ron', 'Levin', 'enough', 'money', 'could', 'bail', 'out', 'BBC', 'turned', 'out', 'Ron', 'scammed', 'Joe', 'Joe', 'was', 'furious', 'decided', 'kill', 'Ron', 'Levin', 'Joe', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'was', 'leaving', 'hand', 'written', 'to-do', 'list', 'Ron', 'house', 'police', 'found', 'list', 'later', 'used', 'court', 'prosecutor', 'proclaimed', 'recipe', 'murder', '.In', 'Joe', 'continual', 'pursuit', 'more', 'cash', 'plot', 'was', 'hatched', 'kidnap', 'Hedayat', 'Eslaminia', 'rich', 'former', 'Iranian', 'official', 'hold', 'ransom', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'either', 'Joe', 'was', 'losing', 'control', 'guys', 'Two', 'guys', 'secretly', 'went', 'police', 'led', 'end', 'BBC.Two', 'especially', 'good', 'books', 'were', 'written', 'story', 'are', 'Billionaire', 'Boys', 'Club', 'Sue', 'HortonThe', 'Price', 'Experience', 'Randall', 'Sullivan']",N/A
330601,AETEH7SOTOFRT,6302732883,KittyScratchesBooks,"[0, 1]","This film held up well over the years, particularly in sync when this crime occurred. Marvin J. Chomsky never disappoints, an excellent director of his day and I wish he would teach this new generation how to direct a strong true story in this current era. The true stories are poorly miscast; the directors today wash out or over develop the films today and they appear so cheap looking and bad and refuses to apply a colour technique which is not blinding or too bright. Chomsky knows lighting, set decoration, captures the moment in time when things were extravagant and the cast is a professional cast and mature to handle the story. Yes, they were young, but they were better than what is seen today in actresses or actors. Men look like men, and the women were not wearing duplicate hairstyle of blonde and robotic or pretentious. It was just a entirely different era which no one will understand, except, the director, and the cast. It was a sharp production and my Gen X group will always find this as one of the top best of that year 1987!! The movies of the 80s-90s used warm lighting, set decoration, strength of performances made a BIG difference, the writing was top notch, excellent casting and the taking the subject matter seriously with out adding extra characters (as LMN will do today, they add characters who weren't even in the original investigations or are blonde composites to draw in the suburbanite moms who are already too scared to watch anything. Directors like Chomsky was in your face, selected spot of characters, was not afraid to direct a film with mostly men nor sold out to a female audience to water down the film. You can count on films from Chomsky or from this era. Excellent music, paces very well and does not linger on &#34;romance&#34; to keep women watch. He tells the story with impact and truth and the element of surprise based on that truth. They do not make them this way anymore.
