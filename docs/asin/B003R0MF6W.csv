1359986,AAED7MGKR5S80,B003R0MF6W,Amber S.,"[4, 4]","I found this series on Netflix actually, and the reviews on here just made me wanna see it more so I went ahead and played the first episode.  After that I was hooked and could not tear myself away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cannot believe that the CW network had this phenomenal show in their line up, only to make the big mistake of cancelling it after just a mere two seasons and 26 episodes!!!!  In my opinion, this is a good way to lose their fan base.  They did this to another amazing show in the past, and I thought that they had learned their lesson; this just goes to show you that they have not.It was obvious to me that on the last episode, they knew it to be their last so the writers did a last minute rewrite to give it the best send off that they possibly could for the characters.  I guarantee that had this show been given the opportunity like all the crap that is on tv today to last for a few more seasons, it would've had a more fulfilling ending than this did.  Not that it wasn't fulfilling, it was.  It just wasn't supposed to end so soon and I think that the audience knew it came far sooner than it was deserved.  That's the only slightly bad thing I have to say about this show and it isn't even enough for me to knock it down a star.  This wasn't the shows fault.  It was a true diamond in the rough.  But instead the CW Network decided to give this show the boot and keep all this other crap on the air instead.  A poor mistake on their end.  It's hard to find a really decent show with heart, not to mention wit these days.  Then if you're lucky a show like this will come along only be cancelled long before it actually should have been.In simple english, if you've not seen this show you really should.  I was hooked simply by the first episode and was sad when I had to turn if off for one day and wait till the next night to watch it again.  It is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Britt Robertson is a very talented woman and I expect we'll definitely be seeing her in much more soon to come.  As if she doesn't have a track record already....she's one of the few great actresses we have in Hollywoood.",5,A diamond in the rough...,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,2127,"['found', 'series', 'Netflix', 'actually', 'reviews', 'here', 'just', 'made', 'wan', 'see', 'more', 'so', 'went', 'ahead', 'played', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'could', 'not', 'tear', 'away', 'Can', 'not', 'believe', 'CW', 'network', 'had', 'phenomenal', 'show', 'line', 'up', 'only', 'make', 'big', 'mistake', 'cancelling', 'just', 'mere', 'two', 'seasons', '26', 'episodes', 'opinion', 'good', 'way', 'lose', 'fan', 'base', 'did', 'amazing', 'show', 'past', 'thought', 'had', 'learned', 'lesson', 'just', 'show', 'have', 'not.It', 'was', 'obvious', 'last', 'episode', 'knew', 'be', 'last', 'writers', 'did', 'last', 'minute', 'rewrite', 'give', 'best', 'send', 'off', 'possibly', 'could', 'characters', 'guarantee', 'had', 'show', 'been', 'given', 'opportunity', 'crap', 'tv', 'today', 'last', 'few', 'more', 'seasons', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'ending', 'did', 'Not', 'was', ""n't"", 'fulfilling', 'was', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'end', 'so', 'soon', 'think', 'audience', 'knew', 'came', 'far', 'sooner', 'was', 'deserved', 'only', 'slightly', 'bad', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'show', ""n't"", 'even', 'enough', 'knock', 'down', 'star', 'was', ""n't"", 'shows', 'fault', 'was', 'true', 'diamond', 'rough', 'instead', 'CW', 'Network', 'decided', 'give', 'show', 'boot', 'keep', 'other', 'crap', 'air', 'instead', 'poor', 'mistake', 'end', 'hard', 'find', 'really', 'decent', 'show', 'heart', 'not', 'mention', 'days', 'Then', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'show', 'will', 'come', 'only', 'be', 'cancelled', 'long', 'actually', 'should', 'have', 'been.In', 'simple', 'english', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'show', 'really', 'should', 'was', 'hooked', 'simply', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'sad', 'when', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'one', 'day', 'wait', 'till', 'next', 'night', 'watch', 'again', 'AMAZING', 'Britt', 'Robertson', 'very', 'talented', 'woman', 'expect', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'seeing', 'much', 'more', 'soon', 'come', ""n't"", 'have', 'track', 'record', 'already', 'one', 'few', 'great', 'actresses', 'have', 'Hollywoood']",Life Unexpected: The Complete First & Second Seasons

This country is turning into a vast wasteland. This was a great thought provoking show, it's too bad the TV execs at the CW don't see it. Well that's another hour that I will not be watching TV, you lose CW, Well at least NBC didn't cancel Parenthood (yet), so I will turn the set on @ 10 PM.Anyway, at least now I have the DVD to remind me that good TV exists for a little while anyway, and I can watch Life Unexpected anytime I want to, while the rest of you watch Snookie do stupid things. I'm happy about that.As always, Warner Brothers did a nice job with this release, it has a slipcase and an ""Amaray"" style case that holds the six discs. There is a booklet that provides a synopsis, original airdate and the writer and director of each episode. The audio and video are top notch, as with all Warner Brothers TV on DVD seems to be. As far as I can determine, music has not been replaced, and there is no mention of it anywhere on the packaging, so I assume everything is the same as it was broadcasted.I think had the show been able to continue, it would have gotten more interesting, but considering the last season was not a full season by CW standards, it was wrapped up nicely. Good TV is hard to come by, maybe in syndication this show will find the audience it deserved. If not, pick up the DVD, you can't go wrong with this one.Now, I'm waiting for WB to release the final season of Everwood, which IS coming out on August 2nd - and includes and alternate ending!

The main character Lux seems to be the most critical of all, and ungrateful as well as disrespectful towards her newly found parents, who are trying very hard to please her and do the right thing. She is a very cute teen, but her personality is real bit..y for the whole first season.There is also a huge amount of analyzing and self-analyzing at every episode, most of the time in a negative way, which also gets repetitive and tiresome to listen to.

At first I tuned in because I was a fan of Kerr Smith and Shiri Appleby from Dawson's Creek and Roswell, respectively. However, now the whole cast are on my ""to watch"" list. I didn't like the character of Lux at first, she was an immature brat, but she grew on me. Tasha only became liked right at the end of s2, and I've always HATED Bug. We get to see Lux and her birth parents mature. We see them struggle with their emotions, and both parents lie to each other about their love for the other. S2 had a controversial storyline involving a student/teacher relationship that many harped about. I personally liked it, it was written maturely and done tastefully. Perhaps it was because I was a fan of the teacher's portrayer, Shaun Sipos, from the remake of Melrose Place (which definitely deserved another season, hello- 90210 is TERRIBLE!)

1359994,A35FIQ83PE0E07,B003R0MF6W,Irikefe Okonedo,"[0, 0]","Note: this review contains some spoilers.Life Unexpected is set in Portland, Oregon and tells the story of sixteen-year-old year old girl Lux (played by Britt Robertson) and her journey to gain family and relationships. Lux has spent all of her life in foster care, moving from one foster home to another. She and best friend Natasha (also sixteen) are sick of foster care and are looking to get emancipated so that they can be independent and move in with their boyfriends. However, to get the ball rolling for herself Lux has to get signatures from both of her birth parents approving her emancipation. Lux tracks down her birth father Nathan `Baze' Bazile (played by Kristoffer Polaha) who runs a bar (and lives above it with two of his friends) and discovers that her birth mother is Cate Cassidy (played by Shiri Appleby of Roswell fame), co-presenter of radio station K-100's hit show Morning Madness alongside her boyfriend Ryan Thomas (played by Kerr Smith of Dawson's Creek fame). It transpires that Baze got Cate pregnant in high school (after senior prom) and Lux was the result. But at the time Baze was a self-absorbed young man and did nothing to support Cate. Cate then gave Lux up for adoption because she felt that she was too young to be a mother. When Lux now appears in Cate and Baze's lives 16 years later (they are now in their early thirties) Cate and Baze discover that Lux was never adopted because she had a hole in her heart when she was a baby which made her undesirable to prospective adopters. Hence Lux has spent her entire life in the foster care system, which Cate and Baze feel very guilty about. They want to do everything possible to help Lux's life get better so agree to sign the forms approving her emancipation and accompany her to the hearing in court. But when the day comes for the hearing, the judge does not approve Lux's emancipation and instead grants Cate and Lux joint custody of Lux. However Cate will be the primary caregiver due to the fact that she has a stable job and a house. And so Lux enters into her new `family'.Much of season 1 concerns the dynamics of the fact that Lux's birth parents are not together. There is a love triangle: Cate is in a serious relationship with Ryan but may have feelings for Baze and vice versa. Meanwhile Ryan feels that Baze interferes in his and Cate's relationship and feels threatened, seeing Baze as a rival whilst Baze feels that Ryan is trying to take his place as Lux's father (indeed at one point Cate and Ryan conspire to try and shut Baze out of Lux's life). Meanwhile Lux is trying to fit into school and make friends, to try to be a `normal' teenager, to deal with drama with her boyfriend Bug and to adapt to her new parental (Cate and Baze) and step-parental (Ryan) relationships. There is also the largely painful story of Baze's relationship with his father.Season 2's plotting is even more intricate: Lux enters into a secret and illegal relationship with her English teacher Eric Daniels (played by Shaun Sipos) who is seven years older than her and the outplaying of this relationship and its consequences drives much of the season. Other major plot strands are the sharp ups and downs in Cate and Ryan's young marriage (the wedding took place at the end of season 1) because they seem unable to be completely honest with each other, Baze going to work for his dad's financial company and him and his boss Emma Bradshaw (played by Emma Caulfield) falling in love with each other and the revelation that Lux was seriously and horrifically abused by one of her foster parents whilst she was still in foster care, an experience that affected her emotionally and neurologically. On top of this Cate and Ryan become custodians of Natasha (Lux's best friend) and in an act of benevolence get her her own flat. Meanwhile Baze's up and down relationship with his father continues.Across the two seasons Life Unexpected was really good. My biggest complaint was that there were only two seasons and each one only had 13 episodes, meaning only 26 episodes in total. I would have liked to have seen this series run for years. My favourite character was possibly Baze due to his charisma, the way he bonded with his newly found teenage daughter Lux and the way he changed over the course of the two seasons. I was also fond of Cate Cassidy: a flawed but strangely endearing character. Ironically I found Lux the main protagonist often annoying, in fact, more often annoying than not. But bizarrely this didn't undermine Life Unexpected at all as the storytelling was just so solid and the characters and their interactions so compelling. Besides, you don't like everyone in real life! Ryan Thomas was also an excellent character and I found the telling of the story of the ups and downs of his and Cate's relationship and subsequently marriage one of the most absorbing things about the series. Nonetheless this was the story of Lux and her `family tree' (see the opening theme near the start of each episode) and running as a wonderful theme throughout the two series was the truth that no matter what Lux did (and she does a lot) or however much she tested and tried her parents (especially Cate) they would never let go of her because they loved her. I would have given this DVD box set five stars if not for a slightly contrived part of the ending of the final episode of season 2. But this is in truth a minor quibble as Life Unexpected makes for excellent and very rewarding viewing.

I am so sick of getting wrapped into great shows that get canceled before their time. I believe this show deserves another season. (small spoiler I am about to say) If the show did not introduce the sort of student-teacher relationship drama, the show would have done much better because parents did not approve of that. Now that it is over, then maybe ratings could be better. It will be a whole new set up too, college life! As a college student, I would like to watch that. The two other shows with college are so different from what this could be. Greek is about the Greek system and is extremely bubbly, there is not a person like Lux; Gossip Girl is not even about college, it is just NY rich kid drama.The actual review:ANYWAYS, watch Life Unexpected. It is about a girl, Lux, who was given up at birth and at 16 finds her parents. Due to medical issues, she was never adopted and grew up in the system. Her father, Nathaniel ""Baze"", owns a bar, and her mother, Kate Cassidy, is a radio talk show host. Lux coming back into their lives forces them all to grow up, a little.

To me, that is what great characterization is all about. Sadly, I see so little of it today in novels, movies and on TV; and so I loved the first season of Life Unexpected, especially because I also felt there was a moral side to the show: people trying to do the right thing in spite of their character defects.Then the second season of the show started and Lux got involved in an illegal relationship with her teacher, Mr. Daniels. Maybe I'm old fashioned, but a teacher having a sexual relationship with an underage girl should be taboo on a family/young adult TV show, especially when the characters involved - Lux and Mr. Daniels - don't seem to have any strong quilt or misgivings. The moral aspect of the show went out the window. Suddenly, watching the show was difficult for me. If I had kids I certainly wouldn't want them to watch.What I don't understand is why the show's producers chose to go down the road they did.

The twist is that they are no longer together, and her mother is marrying a co-worker.  It is hard for this thrown-together family to adjust to one another after so many years apart.  The cast members are great all around, the music is appropriately chosen, and the stories are compelling.  Why did they cancel it?",5,Wish it had gone on longer,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,535,"['real', 'shame', 'show', 'only', 'got', 'couple', 'seasons', 'interesting', 'unpredictable', 'highly', 'likeable', 'story', 'Lux', 'foster', 'child', 'who', 'birth', 'parents', 'when', '16', 'up', 'living', 'twist', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'together', 'mother', 'marrying', 'co-worker', 'hard', 'thrown-together', 'family', 'adjust', 'one', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'apart', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'great', 'around', 'music', 'appropriately', 'chosen', 'stories', 'are', 'compelling', 'Why', 'did', 'cancel']",Life Unexpected: The Complete First & Second Seasons
