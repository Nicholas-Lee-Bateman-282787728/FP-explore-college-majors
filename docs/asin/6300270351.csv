236607,A3CSRP3P4U9HI,6300270351,Alan R. Holyoak,"[13, 15]","There have been many film adaptations of Edgar Rice Burrough's tales of Tarzan.  Most of them were produced in the earlier days of movie making, and were filmed on back lots in Hollywood.  While a number of them provided  good entertainment, few of them really depicted Burrough's book,  &quot;Tarzan, Lord of the Apes.&quot;  &quot;Greystoke&quot; is, however,  different in that respect.While there are certainly disparities  between Burrough's book and this movie, &quot;Greystoke&quot; is the most  faithful in storyline, character development, and essence of any Tarzan  movie I have seen.  Christopher Lambert does a great job as Tarzan.  And  Andie MacDowell makes an enticing Jane.I wonder how the movie would  have played though if the director/producer had decided to use Andie  MacDowell's own voice instead of opting to have Glenn Close do voice overs  for all of Andie's lines?  Perhaps they thought that Andie's slight  southern accent would detract from the atmosphere they were trying to  develop?Anyway, the visual impact of the movie is great.  The scenery is  awesome.  The sound track is supporting and blends into the overall sensory  effect that helps drive the movie forward.  One down side has to be the  costuming for the apes.  While the costumes were adequate, they were  inferior to other top-notch visual effects of the movie.  To be fair to the  special effects folks, there were few other options in 1983 that would  allow a more realistic representation of animals like great apes and the  kinds of ape-human interactions needed to make the film work.While the  intent of Burroughs, or of the movie, is not to depict true ape biology,  the scenes showing apes using leaves to get water from a puddle, and twigs  to get ants from an ant hill are well documented ape behaviors.  Another  impressive part of the movie to me was the accurate portrayal of the state  of the art of Victorian English biological science -- &quot;Bring 'em back  preserved.&quot;  Along those same lines, the overriding sense of human,  and especially British superiority of that era also comes through in the  movie.All in all a great effort.  Definitely 5 stars for setting the  standard for Tarzan movies, and for being a well-done piece of film  making.Alan Holyoak",5,"The best adaptation of Burrough's &quot;Tarzan, Lord of the Apes&quot;",959212800,"05 25, 2000",2000,2276,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burrough', 'tales', 'Tarzan', 'Most', 'were', 'produced', 'earlier', 'days', 'movie', 'making', 'were', 'filmed', 'back', 'lots', 'Hollywood', 'number', 'provided', 'good', 'entertainment', 'few', 'really', 'depicted', 'Burrough', 'book', 'quot', 'Tarzan', 'Lord', 'Apes.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Greystoke', 'quot', 'however', 'different', 'respect.While', 'are', 'certainly', 'disparities', 'Burrough', 'book', 'movie', 'quot', 'Greystoke', 'quot', 'most', 'faithful', 'storyline', 'character', 'development', 'essence', 'Tarzan', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'great', 'job', 'Tarzan', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'enticing', 'Jane.I', 'wonder', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'director/producer', 'had', 'decided', 'use', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'own', 'voice', 'instead', 'opting', 'have', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'do', 'voice', 'overs', 'Andie', 'lines', 'Perhaps', 'thought', 'Andie', 'slight', 'southern', 'accent', 'would', 'detract', 'atmosphere', 'were', 'trying', 'develop', 'Anyway', 'visual', 'impact', 'movie', 'great', 'scenery', 'awesome', 'sound', 'track', 'supporting', 'blends', 'overall', 'sensory', 'effect', 'drive', 'movie', 'forward', 'One', 'down', 'side', 'be', 'costuming', 'apes', 'costumes', 'were', 'adequate', 'were', 'inferior', 'other', 'top-notch', 'visual', 'effects', 'movie', 'be', 'fair', 'special', 'effects', 'folks', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'options', '1983', 'would', 'allow', 'more', 'realistic', 'representation', 'animals', 'great', 'apes', 'kinds', 'ape-human', 'interactions', 'needed', 'make', 'film', 'intent', 'Burroughs', 'movie', 'not', 'depict', 'true', 'ape', 'biology', 'scenes', 'showing', 'apes', 'using', 'leaves', 'get', 'water', 'puddle', 'twigs', 'get', 'ants', 'ant', 'hill', 'are', 'well', 'documented', 'ape', 'behaviors', 'impressive', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'state', 'art', 'Victorian', 'English', 'biological', 'science', 'quot', 'Bring', 'back', 'preserved.', 'quot', 'Along', 'same', 'lines', 'overriding', 'sense', 'human', 'especially', 'British', 'superiority', 'era', 'also', 'movie.All', 'great', 'effort', 'Definitely', '5', 'stars', 'setting', 'standard', 'Tarzan', 'movies', 'being', 'well-done', 'piece', 'film', 'making.Alan', 'Holyoak']",N/A
236608,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,6300270351,Andre Dursin,"[4, 4]","A fascinating curiosity but something of a troubled and uneven picture, ""Greystoke"" was originally the brainchild of ""Chinatown"" writer Robert Towne. After languishing in pre-production hell for years, Warner Bros. finally decided to rework Towne's script - which he had originally wanted to direct himself -- as a vehicle for director Hugh Hudson, then a red hot commodity after the Oscar-winning ""Chariots of Fire.""The resulting film, which Towne removed his name from (in favor of the pseudonym ""P.H. Vazak"" - Towne's dog!), reportedly retained the structure of Towne's script in its first half - showing the upbringing of young Lord Greystoke (Christopher Lambert) in the wilds of Africa by a society of apes and his eventual discovery by a group of adventurers led by Ian Holm. However, Hudson deviated from both the script, as well as Edgar Rice Borroughs' source material, in its tedious second half, when Tarzan returns to the family manor in Scotland and meets dear old grandpa (Ralph Richardson). Suddenly the film shifts gears from a gorgeous, albeit serious adaptation of Tarzan in the wild to a drawing room drama a la Merchant-Ivory, compounded by leaden scenes (Richardson's Earl of Greystoke sliding down a flight of stairs on a dining service tray) and the decision to have Glenn Close dub the movie's Jane - Andie McDowell (a film debut she's spent her career living down). The latter eliminates any chance of Lambert and McDowell generating any chemistry together, so the love story comes across as limp while the dramatic development of Greystoke (he's never called Tarzan at any point in the film) and his failure to acclimate to civilization seems misplaced compared to the upbeat, exciting thrills of Borroughs' original stories.Further hampered by extensive post-production cutting (after poor test screenings, Warner Bros. reportedly slashed nearly 40 minutes from the film), ""Greystoke"" comes across as an entertaining missed opportunity that flirts with greatness but was sabotaged by poor filmmaking decisions - defined most clearly by the clashing sensibilities of Towne's script (which envisioned portraying Tarzan's story from the point of view of the apes) with Hudson's interest in depicting stuffy Anglo aristocracy. It's nevertheless a gorgeous looking letdown, thanks to John Alcott's stellar cinematography; between the movie's visuals and lush production, the film provides a feasts for the ears and eyes, even if it leaves you lamenting that Towne never had the chance to bring his original script to the screen (regrettably, the failure of ""Personal Best,"" and its spiraling budget, forced the writer to sell his ""Greystoke"" script to Warner Bros. in order to get that picture completed).After being delayed for several months, ""Greystoke"" - the fourth Blu-Ray release from the Warner Archives - is a winner. The 1080p AVC encoded presentation preserves Alcott's cinematography in a crisp, beautiful image that does justice to its most accomplished technical attribute. The 5.1 DTS MA track is likewise potent with a nice array of sound effects and one of John Scott's finest scores filling the sound stage. Extras include commentary from the director and associate producer Garth Thomas along with the original trailer. Viewers should note this is the slightly extended version of the movie previously seen on laserdisc and DVD, offering a brief Overture and prologue sequence that was trimmed from the theatrical release.",3,"A Troubled, Yet Gorgeous, Tarzan Adaptation with a Great First Half",1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,3463,"['fascinating', 'curiosity', 'something', 'troubled', 'uneven', 'picture', 'Greystoke', 'was', 'originally', 'brainchild', 'Chinatown', 'writer', 'Robert', 'Towne', 'languishing', 'pre-production', 'hell', 'years', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'finally', 'decided', 'rework', 'Towne', 'script', 'had', 'originally', 'wanted', 'direct', 'vehicle', 'director', 'Hugh', 'Hudson', 'then', 'red', 'hot', 'commodity', 'Oscar-winning', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'resulting', 'film', 'Towne', 'removed', 'name', 'favor', 'pseudonym', 'P.H', 'Vazak', 'Towne', 'dog', 'reportedly', 'retained', 'structure', 'Towne', 'script', 'first', 'half', 'showing', 'upbringing', 'young', 'Lord', 'Greystoke', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'wilds', 'Africa', 'society', 'apes', 'eventual', 'discovery', 'group', 'adventurers', 'led', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'However', 'Hudson', 'deviated', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Borroughs', 'source', 'material', 'tedious', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'Tarzan', 'family', 'manor', 'Scotland', 'meets', 'dear', 'old', 'grandpa', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Suddenly', 'film', 'shifts', 'gears', 'gorgeous', 'albeit', 'serious', 'adaptation', 'Tarzan', 'wild', 'drawing', 'room', 'drama', 'la', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'compounded', 'leaden', 'scenes', 'Richardson', 'Earl', 'Greystoke', 'sliding', 'down', 'flight', 'stairs', 'dining', 'service', 'tray', 'decision', 'have', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'movie', 'Jane', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'film', 'debut', 'spent', 'career', 'living', 'down', 'latter', 'chance', 'Lambert', 'McDowell', 'generating', 'chemistry', 'together', 'love', 'story', 'across', 'limp', 'dramatic', 'development', 'Greystoke', 'never', 'called', 'Tarzan', 'point', 'film', 'failure', 'acclimate', 'civilization', 'misplaced', 'compared', 'upbeat', 'exciting', 'thrills', 'Borroughs', 'original', 'stories.Further', 'hampered', 'extensive', 'post-production', 'cutting', 'poor', 'test', 'screenings', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'reportedly', 'slashed', 'nearly', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'Greystoke', 'across', 'entertaining', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'greatness', 'was', 'sabotaged', 'poor', 'filmmaking', 'decisions', 'defined', 'most', 'clearly', 'clashing', 'sensibilities', 'Towne', 'script', 'envisioned', 'portraying', 'Tarzan', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'apes', 'Hudson', 'interest', 'depicting', 'stuffy', 'Anglo', 'aristocracy', 'nevertheless', 'gorgeous', 'looking', 'letdown', 'thanks', 'John', 'Alcott', 'stellar', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'visuals', 'lush', 'production', 'film', 'feasts', 'ears', 'eyes', 'even', 'lamenting', 'Towne', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'bring', 'original', 'script', 'screen', 'regrettably', 'failure', 'Personal', 'Best', 'spiraling', 'budget', 'forced', 'writer', 'sell', 'Greystoke', 'script', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'order', 'get', 'picture', 'completed', '.After', 'being', 'delayed', 'several', 'months', 'Greystoke', 'fourth', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'winner', '1080p', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'presentation', 'preserves', 'Alcott', 'cinematography', 'crisp', 'beautiful', 'image', 'justice', 'most', 'accomplished', 'technical', 'attribute', '5.1', 'DTS', 'MA', 'track', 'likewise', 'potent', 'nice', 'array', 'sound', 'effects', 'one', 'John', 'Scott', 'finest', 'scores', 'filling', 'sound', 'stage', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'director', 'associate', 'producer', 'Garth', 'Thomas', 'original', 'trailer', 'Viewers', 'should', 'note', 'slightly', 'extended', 'version', 'movie', 'previously', 'seen', 'laserdisc', 'DVD', 'offering', 'brief', 'Overture', 'prologue', 'sequence', 'was', 'trimmed', 'theatrical', 'release']",N/A
236609,AB4F6UHL20U95,6300270351,Anne Rice,"[2, 3]","As far as I know this is film comes closest to the original books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but only in the first half.  It's a beautifully photographed film, well directed, and with an outstanding cast.  And it is very enjoyable.  Christopher Lambert is appealing as Tarzan, and the boy actors who play him growing up in the jungle are excellent.  The attempt to portray the apes as characters works well.  Ian Holm is marvelous in his role as an educated European who discovers Tarzan in the wild, and Sir Ralph Richardson is unforgettable as the grandfather(Lord Greystoke) whom Tarzan comes to meet in England.  Andie McDowell is appealing and lovely as Jane, though it is a tragedy that her voice was removed from the film and the voice of Glenn Close was dubbed instead.  In the novels, Jane is from Baltimore, and undoubtedly Andie McDowell's sensitive and tender voice would have been very effective.  That being said, the dubbing is very skilled; I doubt anyone who doesn't know the voice is being dubbed would even notice it.  I certainly didn't know the first time around.  And I didn't notice anything false about the dubbing a couple of nights ago when I watched the film again.  The second half of the movie involves an original story on the part of the movie people as to what happens to Tarzan on his return to England.  It's well done.  But it's not Burroughs.  And it's really not &#34;Tarzan of the Apes&#34; either.  ---  I recommend this film for Tarzan aficionados because of what it does attempt and achieve, and see no point on missing out on the fun of it due to what it doesn't attempt or achieve.  BUT some day I hope some one does attempt a great Tarzan movie truly based on the first two books of Edgar Rice Burroughs' series.  ----  In those books, Tarzan is a super hero, a man of the jungle with such strength, skill, cunning and intelligence  that he can adjust to any society --- including that of Europeans or Arabs, as well as the society of the apes in Africa and the natives in Africa.  In this age when there is so much attention to the super hero, and we have so many stunning films exploring super heroes with high productive values, we could really use a great &#34;Tarzan&#34; film.  I hope we get it.  I hope some one does for the franchise (?) what Kenneth Branagh did for Mary Shelley's Frankenstein ---  In the meantime, I like this film very much for what it does offer.  I admire its productive values, and its cast, and its cinematography.",5,An Impressive Film,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,2488,"['As', 'far', 'know', 'film', 'closest', 'original', 'books', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'only', 'first', 'half', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'film', 'well', 'directed', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'appealing', 'Tarzan', 'boy', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'growing', 'up', 'jungle', 'are', 'excellent', 'attempt', 'portray', 'apes', 'characters', 'well', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'marvelous', 'role', 'educated', 'European', 'who', 'Tarzan', 'wild', 'Sir', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'unforgettable', 'grandfather', 'Lord', 'Greystoke', 'whom', 'Tarzan', 'meet', 'England', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'appealing', 'lovely', 'Jane', 'tragedy', 'voice', 'was', 'removed', 'film', 'voice', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'was', 'dubbed', 'instead', 'novels', 'Jane', 'Baltimore', 'undoubtedly', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'sensitive', 'tender', 'voice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'effective', 'being', 'said', 'dubbing', 'very', 'skilled', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'voice', 'being', 'dubbed', 'would', 'even', 'notice', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'anything', 'false', 'dubbing', 'couple', 'nights', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'original', 'story', 'part', 'movie', 'people', 'what', 'Tarzan', 'return', 'England', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'Burroughs', 'really', 'not', '34', 'Tarzan', 'Apes', '34', 'recommend', 'film', 'Tarzan', 'aficionados', 'what', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'see', 'point', 'missing', 'out', 'fun', 'due', 'what', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'achieve', 'BUT', 'day', 'hope', 'one', 'attempt', 'great', 'Tarzan', 'movie', 'truly', 'based', 'first', 'two', 'books', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'series', 'books', 'Tarzan', 'super', 'hero', 'man', 'jungle', 'such', 'strength', 'skill', 'cunning', 'intelligence', 'can', 'adjust', 'society', 'including', 'Europeans', 'Arabs', 'as', 'well', 'society', 'apes', 'Africa', 'natives', 'Africa', 'age', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'super', 'hero', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'stunning', 'films', 'exploring', 'super', 'heroes', 'high', 'productive', 'values', 'could', 'really', 'use', 'great', '34', 'Tarzan', '34', 'film', 'hope', 'get', 'hope', 'one', 'franchise', 'what', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'did', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'Frankenstein', 'meantime', 'like', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'offer', 'admire', 'productive', 'values', 'cast', 'cinematography']",N/A
236610,A2MR43RDPZX3J,6300270351,Applewhite Minyard,"[0, 1]","Christopher Lambert as Tarzan? Is this someone's idea of a joke? He is not convincing at all as the Lord of the Jungle. Sir Ralph Richardson is much more convincing as his older relative, but Lambert's portrayal is lame, though he tries hard. The story line, while attempting to show some of the complexity of Edgar Rice Burroughs original composition, falls far short of being true to the book, which has actually never been attempted. Film makers grab onto some part of the Burroughs creation and then just go wherever they want to with that. All the films starring Johnny Weismuller and others are a joke to the Burroughs community. They are nothing like the &#34;real&#34; character. Of course Burroughs couldn't sustain such a fantasy character, though he made an industry out of it by penning over two dozen follow ups to &#34;Tarzan of the Apes.&#34; After awhile, his books became repetitive and almost parodies of his own original.However, this movie tries to follow at least the beginnings with some attention to the book character's origins, but soon gives up on that and turns it into something else entirely. It has a good beginning, a ridiculous middle, and a purposely pathetic ending.

I wish here Lambert would have been given more English lines than resorting to animal mimicry to express his anger to Sir Evelyn (Wells) as it would seem more logical to express his frustration in a tongue that society would have understood and how that society is not much different and perhaps even more jungle-like than the real jungle.

Since that time, I've seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department. I'm just disgusted the long-awaited DVD was so poorly done, the quality of this transfer hardly better than the VHS tape.The jungle scenes are filmed in Cameroon, and ""lush"" is the best adjective to describe what you see. Except for jungle sounds, ""seeing"" is certainly almost everything in the beginning as there is almost no ""hearing,"" no dialog until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) befriends Ian Holm and vice-versa....so be ready for that, if you haven't watched this film.Story-wise, all I'll say is this is not the Tarzan many of us came to know in Johnny Weismuller films.....but that's not a complaint. For those craving action, and don't care about cinematography as I do, you just have to get past that silent introduction period . In this Tarzan version, our hero goes back to Scotland (his roots), adapts to that environment (for the most part....and a little too quickly for credibility, frankly) and then returns to the jungle without Jane. This is supposedly more true to the Tarzan books, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.The special effects in here were done by Rick Baker, one of the best in the business.

236627,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6300270351,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","Elmo Lincoln had the distinction of playing the first Tarzan in 1918, and Johnny Weissmuller played the first talking Tarzan in 1932 in ""Tarzan the Ape Man"", the first of 12 films to star Weissmuller. Buster Crabbe played him in 1935 in a 12 part series called ""Tarzan the Fearless"" and Bruce Bennett did the same in 1937 under the title ""The New Adventures of Tarzan"".  Lex Barker succeeded him from 1949 to 1953 (5 films) and Gordon Scott followed Baxter from 1955 to 1960 (6 films). Nearly a dozen other actors played Tarzan at some point, but the most unique performance is from Christopher Lambert in ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"" (1984).Lambert is best known for his ""Highlander"" films (1986, 1991, 1994, 2000). Though born on Long Island, he moved to Switzerland at the age of 2. His first few films were French, and ""Greystoke"" was his first English film. He made a number of other English speaking films (e.g., ""The Sicilian"" in 1987, ""Mortal Combat"" in 1995) but most of his subsequent work has been foreign, primarily French. He won the Cesar Award (French Oscar) in 1986 for ""Subway"", a Luc Besson film.The film features Ralph Richardson, Iam Holm, and Andie MacDowell as Jane.Ralph Richardson was nominated for an Oscar for his work in this film, his only other Oscar nomination having occurred 35 years earlier for ""The Heiress"" (1949). He won the Best Supporting Actor from the NY Film critics for this film and ""The Sound Barrier"" (1952), and won Best Actor at Cannes for ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" (1962). Richardson made more than 50 films between 1933 and 1985. I remember him best in ""Time Bandits"" (1981) as the Supreme Bandit. Richardson plays Tarzan's grandfather. He died shortly after filming and the movie was dedicated to him. The NY Times praised his performance and said he ""dominates the film.""The great character actor Ian Holm is the man who discovers Greystoke, tutors him, and brings him back to ""civilization."" Holms appeared in more than 100 films. He was nominated for an Oscar for his role as the coach in ""Chariots of Fire"" (1981), and received 6 BAFTA nominations, winning twice (""Chariots of Fire"" and ""The Bofors Gun""). He's probably most famous as Bilbo Baggins in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but I think his performance in ""Greystoke"" is his best.Andie MacDowell made her film debut in ""Greystoke"" and has gone on to make nearly 50 films, garnering Golden Globe nominations for her work in ""Sex, Lies, and Videotapes"" (1989), ""Green Card"" (1990), ""Short Cuts"" (1993), and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (1994). She won a Saturn Award for ""Groundhog Day"" opposite Bill Murray. Because the producers of Greystoke thought her southern accent didn't fit her English background, they dubbed in Glenn Close.The film is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel and the first part is true to the original while the second half goes off on a tangent that Burroughs probably would have approved of. The original idea of Tarzan came from the ""wild boy"" literature that was popular in the 19th Century, and Burroughs specifically acknowledged the influence of Rudyard Kipling's ""Mowgli"" from ""The Jungle Book"" (1894). This concept was a reaction to the problems of industrialization and praises the ""simple life"", and the second half of the film focuses on this conflict.The great writer Robert Towne wrote the screenplay. Towne was nominated 5 times for an Oscar, winning for ""Chinatown"" in 1975. Among his other notable films are ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967), ""Shampoo"" (1975), ""Personal Best"" (1982), ""The Firm"" (1993) and ""Mission Impossible"" (1996, 2000). He was originally supposed to direct the film, was fired, and then requested that his dog's, P.H.Vazak, receive screen credit for writing. To his dismay, P.H.Vazak was nominated for an Oscar.The beautiful photography is by John Alcott, the Oscar winning photographer of ""Barry Lyndon"" (1975), one of the dullest but most beautifully filmed movies of all time. Alcott's credits also include ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971), ""The Shining"" (1980), and ""No Way Out"" (1987).Hugh Hudson directs. Best known for his first film, the award winning ""Chariots of Fire"" (1981), Hudson's career would never reach those heights again. His subsequent films include ""I Dreamed of Africa"" (2000), ""My Life so Far"" (1999), and ""Revolution"" (1985). Hudson brought several actors from ""Chariots"" to ""Greystoke"" including Ian Holm, Ian Charleson, Cheryl Campbell (plays Tarzan's mother), Nigel Davenport, and Richard Griffiths.The music from John Scott and the Royal Philharmonic is exquisite, supplementing the wonderful photography and great locations. In addition to his work in films (""Die Hard"", ""Man on Fire"", ""Living Planet"") Scott worked with performers as diverse as the Beatles, Tom Jones, Nelson Riddle, and Ravi Shankar.The NY Times called the film ""the season's most unexpected, most invigorating surprise"" and correctly observed that it ""isn't in competition with its predecessors. It's a different order of fiction entirely.""The film is terrific, especially the first half, that differs in tone from the second half. There are many memorable scenes, including the departure of Holm, the courtship of Jane, a dinner in which Lambert imitates the sounds of different beasts, Richardson's romp down the stairs, and Tarzan's encounter with his adopted ape father.",5,A new Classic,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,5364,"['Elmo', 'Lincoln', 'had', 'distinction', 'playing', 'first', 'Tarzan', '1918', 'Johnny',

236628,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,6300270351,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[3, 3]","As a kid, I used to read the Edgar Rice Burroughs TARZAN novels - and loved them!  Of all the Tarzan movies I've seen, this one comes the closest to Burrough's vision of the character.  It is tragic that so many people associate Tarzan with the much-parodied (and fabricated) ""Me Tarzan, you Jane.""  This infamous line is not to be found in the books.It may come as a surprise to many, but the Tarzan in the novels is HIGHLY intelligent, cunning, multi-lingual and has had much experience in what we call ""civilization.""  He chooses to go back to the jungle, not because he is against civilization.  Rather, he is simply bored with it.In this movie, they do a good job of showing an English nobleman who was raised in the jungle attempting to adapt & fit into his ""rightful place"" in English / Scottish society.  This sets this film apart from most any other Tarzan movie, and they give it a serious look.The one issue I have with the film is with the casting of Christopher Lambert to play Tarzan / Lord Greystoke.  Lambert is a fine actor, which is why I have mixed feelings about bringing this issue up.  The problem is, in the books Tarzan is always described as being this large, hulking, very muscular guy.  Lambert is simply not a big guy, and he's not particularly buffed up.  On the upside, he does do a terrific job of portraying an English Lord who was raised in the jungle, and still has the jungle in his savage heart.The lovely Andie McDowell is wonderful as a cultured, kind Jane who does her best to integrate the jungle man into his unfamiliar surroundings.  Of course, Andie has always been one of my favorite actresses, so I'm pretty much  a fan of anything she does!This is a very different Tarzan movie than what most are accustomed to.  If you're looking for a movie that all takes place in the jungles of Africa, this is not the one to get.  It is a pyschological journey of a man who was literally raised by apes (in fact, the word Tarzan means ""white ape"") who is thrown into the midst of humankind & does not quite know how to respond.  The film is also unique in that I don't believe ""Tarzan"" is ever mentioned;  he is only known as John Clayton;  Lord Greystoke.

236629,ARNEUO7BF3J55,6300270351,E. David Swan,"[1, 1]","I watched this movie when it first came out in 1984 and it made an indelible impact on me. I don't remember LOVING the film but I did respect it. The movie was probably a more cerebral and realistic interpretation of Tarzan than my 14 year old self was prepared to fully accept. The producers made some fairly radical changes to Tarzan and the storyline but this is one of those rare instances where the film actually improves on the book and in many cases the improvements are dramatic and profound.Perhaps nothing is more emblematic of the changes that the producers made than the fact that at no point in the movie is the Ape Man ever referred to as Tarzan. The name `Tarzan' was given to John Clayton by the apes but that makes no sense. `Tarzan' is not a word that an Ape could even pronounce. If his name was `Ooh-ah' it might make sense. In order to keep the movie within the realm of reality Tarzan had to lose his name and it was the right thing to do. The story also drops the racism, the jungle machismo and Tarzan's preternatural ability to learn languages and customs at a rate far beyond anything conceivable.Let me start with the few problems that the film introduces that weren't present in the book. John Clayton's ability to learn languages has been significantly toned down from the books but he still absorbs at a very fast pace and to explain this the film's writer established Clayton as a skilled mimic. That's all well and good except that Clayton can mimic both human and animal and when the Clayton mimic's an animal it is OBVIOUS that the director just dubbed in actual animal sounds and it just looks silly and cartoonish. This gimmick is used an unfortunate amount of times and brings unintentional humor to more serious scenes. The second problem was in having Clayton meet Jane Porter only after he had traveled to England. In the book Jane sees her `Jungle God' in his element in full glory. It's perfectly believable that she would swoon at the sight of the powerful bronzed warrior. In the movie Jane only sees the bewildered, out of place John Clayton. Sure he shows some signs of bravery and aggression but nothing like in the book where he literally kills a lion with his bare hands (ok, he did have a knife).The biggest difference between the movie and the book is in the second half where John Clayton travels to England to his ancestral home of Greystoke. In the book he made a quick journey to Wisconsin to see Jane but only at the very end of the story. Burroughs Tarzan seems perfectly comfortable in the advanced world whereas the movies Clayton is a complete fish out of water. It's even more than that, Clayton has a very difficult time adjusting and in moments of stress finds himself falling back on his ape like tendencies. There is one awesome scene where Clayton is alone on his first night at Greystoke. He releases his stress by rolling around on the floor making ape sounds. When actor Christopher Lambert make these `ooh ooh' sounds, extends his lips or hunches down it's embarrassing and undignified but that's the point. Clayton was raised by apes and being an ape is his comfort zone. By having Clayton act in this way the movie greatly improves on the story even if it often reaches the level of uncomfortable. I hate to label Clayton as having mental problems but if being incapable of conforming to the standards of the general public defines one as having mental problems than this is clearly Clayton's state. Of course he cannot conform to public standards, this world is completely foreign to him and naturally someone untrained in human interaction is going to act in ways that are uncomfortable and embarrassing. If anything the movie massively downplays the troubles of integrating a feral adult into society and in the end Clayton has no choice but to return to his natural environment.In the finale John Clayton transforms from the Earl of Graystoke into Tarzan for all time. Stripped nearly naked he sinks back into the jungle perhaps the only man alive who could live comfortably in an African jungle with nothing more than a loincloth and a knife. John Clayton is a god in the jungle at the expense of being able to live in modern society. Burroughs did not make this sacrifice and his Tarzan moved seamlessly between the realm of the jungle and mankind. It is to the movies credit that it created a much more well rounded believable character.The movie is a success on so many levels including the wonderful performance by newcomer (at the time) Christopher Lambert but the acting is quite good all around. The apes are played by humans in costumes and it isn't perfect but it's good enough to not be distracting (at least for me). The shots are beautiful and the movie is stirring. For me this is THE quintessential Tarzan movie even if he's never called Tarzan.",5,THIS is the one Tarzan movie you should see,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,4836,"['watched', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1984', 'made', 'indelible', 'impact', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'LOVING', 'film', 'did', 'respect', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'cerebral', 'realistic', 'interpretation', 'Tarzan', '14', 'year', 'old', 'self', 'was', 'prepared', 'fully', 'accept', 'producers', 'made', 'fairly', 'radical', 'changes', 'Tarzan', 'storyline', 'one', 'rare', 'instances', 'where', 'film', 'actually', 'book', 'many', 'cases', 'improvements', 'are', 'dramatic', 'profound.Perhaps', 'nothing', 'more', 'emblematic', 'changes', 'producers', 'made', 'fact', 'point', 'movie', 'Ape', 'Man', 'ever', 'referred', 'Tarzan', 'name', 'Tarzan', 'was', 'given', 'John', 'Clayton', 'apes', 'sense', 'Tarzan', 'not', 'word', 'Ape', 'could', 'even', 'pronounce', 'name', 'was', 'Ooh-ah', 'might', 'make', 'sense', 'order', 'keep', 'movie', 'realm', 'reality', 'Tarzan', 'had', 'lose', 'name', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'story', 'also', 'racism', 'jungle', 'machismo', 'Tarzan', 'preternatural', 'ability', 'learn', 'languages', 'customs', 'rate', 'far', 'anything', 'conceivable.Let', 'start', 'few', 'problems', 'film', 'introduces', 'were', ""n't"", 'present', 'book', 'John', 'Clayton', 'ability', 'learn', 'languages', 'been', 'significantly', 'toned', 'down', 'books', 'still', 'very', 'fast', 'pace', 'explain', 'film', 'writer', 'established', 'Clayton', 'skilled', 'mimic', 'well', 'good', 'Clayton', 'can', 'mimic', 'human', 'animal', 'when', 'Clayton', 'mimic', 'animal', 'OBVIOUS', 'director', 'just', 'dubbed', 'actual', 'animal', 'sounds', 'just', 'silly', 'cartoonish', 'gimmick', 'used', 'unfortunate', 'amount', 'times', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'more', 'serious', 'scenes', 'second', 'problem', 'was', 'having', 'Clayton', 'meet', 'Jane', 'Porter', 'only', 'had', 'traveled', 'England', 'book', 'Jane', 'Jungle', 'God', 'element', 'full', 'glory', 'perfectly', 'believable', 'would', 'swoon', 'sight', 'powerful', 'bronzed', 'warrior', 'movie', 'Jane', 'only', 'bewildered', 'place', 'John', 'Clayton', 'Sure', 'signs', 'bravery', 'aggression', 'nothing', 'book', 'where', 'literally', 'lion', 'bare', 'hands', 'ok', 'did', 'have', 'knife', '.The', 'biggest', 'difference', 'movie', 'book', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'John', 'Clayton', 'England', 'ancestral', 'home', 'Greystoke', 'book', 'made', 'quick', 'journey', 'Wisconsin', 'see', 'Jane', 'only', 'very', 'end', 'story', 'Burroughs', 'Tarzan', 'perfectly', 'comfortable', 'advanced', 'world', 'movies', 'Clayton', 'complete', 'fish', 'water', 'even', 'more', 'Clayton', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'adjusting', 'moments', 'stress', 'finds', 'falling', 'back', 'ape', 'tendencies', 'one', 'awesome', 'scene', 'where', 'Clayton', 'alone', 'first', 'night', 'Greystoke', 'stress', 'rolling', 'around', 'floor', 'making', 'ape', 'sounds', 'When', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'make', 'ooh', 'ooh', 'sounds', 'lips', 'hunches', 'down', 'embarrassing', 'undignified', 'point', 'Clayton', 'was', 'raised', 'apes', 'being', 'ape', 'comfort', 'zone', 'having', 'Clayton', 'act', 'way', 'movie', 'greatly', 'story', 'even', 'often', 'level', 'uncomfortable', 'hate', 'label', 'Clayton', 'having', 'mental', 'problems', 'being', 'incapable', 'conforming', 'standards', 'general', 'public', 'one', 'having', 'mental', 'problems', 'clearly', 'Clayton', 'state', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'conform', 'public', 'standards', 'world', 'completely', 'foreign', 'naturally', 'someone', 'untrained', 'human', 'interaction', 'going', 'act', 'ways', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'embarrassing', 'anything', 'movie', 'massively', 'troubles', 'integrating', 'feral', 'adult', 'society', 'end', 'Clayton', 'choice', 'return', 'natural', 'environment.In', 'finale', 'John', 'Clayton', 'Earl', 'Graystoke', 'Tarzan', 'time', 'Stripped', 'nearly', 'naked', 'back', 'jungle', 'perhaps', 'only', 'man', 'alive', 'who', 'could', 'live', 'comfortably', 'African', 'jungle', 'nothing', 'more', 'loincloth', 'knife', 'John', 'Clayton', 'god', 'jungle', 'expense', 'being', 'able', 'live', 'modern', 'society', 'Burroughs', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sacrifice', 'Tarzan', 'moved', 'seamlessly', 'realm', 'jungle', 'mankind', 'movies', 'credit', 'created', 'much', 'more', 'well', 'rounded', 'believable', 'character.The', 'movie', 'success', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'including', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'newcomer', 'time', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'around', 'apes', 'are', 'played', 'humans', 'costumes', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'good', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'distracting', 'least', 'shots', 'are', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'stirring', 'quintessential', 'Tarzan', 'movie', 'even', 'never', 'called', 'Tarzan']",N/A

But GREYSTOKE is without a doubt my favorite Tarzan film of all time.  Not only is the only live-action adaptation to capture real emotion and drama, but it is also the most realistic.  This is mainly due to the vastly underrated Christopher Lambert in the title role.  He is absolutely amazing to watch, especially in his reactions to the new English surroundings.  The supporting cast is first-rate, as well.  You have Sir Ian Holm as the explorer who finds Tarzan, Andie MacDowell in her film debut as Jane, and the late, the great Ralph Richardson as Lord Greystoke.  Add onto this a gorgeous musical score, stunning African jungle backgrounds, and some of Rick Baker's best make-up work ever, and you've got one helluva good motion picture.I just can't believe how many people regard this movie as one of those ""what-could-have-been"" disasters.  I hadn't seen the film in years, so when I picked up the DVD, I was prepared to think the same thing do to my older age and higher expectations as a film buff.  Well let me tell you, it's even better than I remembered it!  If the film did indeed have a troubled production, it certainly doesn't show on-screen.  It's a beautiful movie, and required viewing.The new DVD ain't too shabby, either.  The picture looks great and the sound is very clear, if a bit lacking in surround.

The first half hour or so, we come to ""discover"" how he ended up in the jungle, and then as the years go by, we see ""little"" Tarzan (AKA: Greystoke), as he lunges through the vines and has his rapport with the animals.  And this, contrary to what many feel, is one of the highlights of the movie.  Not much English language, but a language only true to its form - which is animal communication, and Lambert pulls it off brilliantly.Then the ""group"" come into the jungle, along with Andie MacDowell, and her father.  To watch how Greystoke deals with the intruders is stunning, and the way he ""rescues"" the stranger from death is well worth viewing.The saddest part of this film, I believe, is when Greystoke is brought back to ""civilization,"" and you can just about feel his pain at the loss of what he knew.  Then, of course, he has become an oddity in ""proper England,"" only to arouse the jealousy of Ms. MacDowell's suitors, as well as uproot whatever theories the social scientists had about human nature.This is a remarkable film, and it is, in some ways, truly a sensational and exotic adventure into the heart of the human heart.  The scene between Greystoke and his newly acquired ""girlfriend"" (MacDowell) borders on the erotic, although this was done with great art, and it didn't plunge the viewer into a tasteless scene of sensationalism.A brilliant movie, and like the title of this review suggests, it is like reading the original novel.

The majestic cinematography and musical score are a magnificent backdrop to a very emotional retelling of the story. The cast is terrific, and very believable in their roles. If you care a little bit about our relationships as humans to the other animal species, and if you have ever loved a pet, you will have at least one tear in your eyes before the end credits begin to roll. I love this movie, and I recommend it highly.Well, the Blu-ray release is a limited release by the Warner Brothers Archive collection, and apparently, there are not many copies around!. So if you love this movie like I do, hurry, before it becomes a collector's item selling for over $100 on e-bay! So I finally received my copy directly from Warners (3 months later than anticipated), and another from a third party with Amazon, because apparently it is temporarily out of stock in the Amazon warehouses. The film is indeed the extended version (137 minutes) with an Overture, and a prologue, before the main titles. The transfer from film to Blu-ray in PANAVISION is breathtaking, and the 5.1 DTS soundtrack is sensational. Not many special features: just the commentary by the director and the standard definition trailer. What happened there Warners?, the previous Blu-ray Archive releases like GYPSY, DEATHTRAP, etc had the trailers remastered in HD.

Lambert's accent was anything but English, and MacDowell's southern drawl was so bad, her lines had to be dubbed in post production.  This film is also notable for being the last role for Ralph Richardson, and contains an honorarium to him in the credits.  For all of its flaws, however, it remains a worthy entry in the Tarzan film library.Among its positive aspects are the magnificent Cameroon jungle scenery, making you believe in the possibility of Tarzan.  The screenplay, while it takes some detours, is closer to the original Burroughs novel than any other Tarzan movie made.  It is, for example, the first one to ever show how the baby John Clayton ended up in Africa, and what happened to his parents.  It is also the first to introduce the Phillipe D'Arnot character, who taught the young Tarzan to speak human language (Belgian) and the ways of civilization.  But, probably the most important contribution is that of Rick Baker, who created the marvelous and believable ape costumes, changing, and raising the bar for make-up and special effects overnight.All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable film, well worth having in your collection.

236646,AX2KTTU418MII,6300270351,Jon Corelis,"[0, 0]","Greystoke - The Legend of Tarzan is a big, ambitious film which obviously aims at being the ultimate Tarzan movie and succeeds.  The film expands on one episode in the original books:  Tarzan, who is actually the lost son of an British earl, goes back to his ancestral home in Scotland, where he is in theory at least now the heir to the earldom.  Set around the turn of the 19/20th centuries, the film falls into two parts, the first showing Tarzan growing up in the African bush, and the second dealing with his attempts to become civilized in Scotland.  In the first part, the cinematography of the African landscape is spectacular, and the special effects depicting primates and other wildlife remarkably well done.  In the second part, the atmosphere of Edwardian upper-class life is richly recreated, and the portrayal of Tarzan's struggle to become civilized convincingly done.  The highlight of the film is Sir Ralph Richardson, who steals the show as the old Earl (Tarzan's grandfather,) and whose last film this was.  Though the film is perhaps a little too long and drags in parts towards the end, it's still consistently entertaining and worth seeing.Advisories:  one mild sex scene, a few gory shots of animals being eaten raw in the jungle and dissected in London.Recommendation:  if you are a fan of the Tarzan books or films, or seriously interested in the Tarzan theme in popular culture, give this five stars as something you must see.  For the rest of us, a four star entertaining movie.[Note:  this review is based on the Warner Brothers 20th Anniversery standard DVD, which I played on a Blu Ray player.  The image was excellent.

236652,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,6300270351,K. Reynolds,"[4, 4]","THIS FILM ABOUT a baby born in the African jungle, raised by apes, and then brought as an adult into strict Edwardian society, was made for high-def. Filmed mostly in Cameroon and Scotland, the color is gorgeous with lush, jungle panoramas contrasted against the cool, grey-washed vistas of the Highlands. Obviously remastered from the high-def master, the 1080p Blu-ray shows no sign of digital manipulation; dirt and scratches have been removed. Details, like Tarzan's scars, the fur on the amazing wolfhounds, and maggots, which are fed into an ape mechanism, look exceptionally realistic.That said, some of Tarzan's ape family looks sketchy now, especially in this age of motion-capture and CGI. (Consider Andy Serkis in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" 2011) These apes, a creation for ""Greystoke,"" are larger than chimpanzees, yet smaller than gorillas. Seven-time Oscar-winning effects artist Rick Baker designed costumes for actors no larger than 5-foot 5. The ape-actors then spent months in training to perfect simian mannerisms. It was cutting-edge at the time and earned Baker an Oscar nomination for Best Makeup along with Paul Engelen. Robert Towne and Michael Austin were also nominated for Best Writing from a Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, in this case Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"" adventure novels. Sir Ralph Richardson, who plays the Sixth Earl of Greystoke, Tarzan's grandfather, earned a posthumous nomination for Best Supporting Actor. ""Greystoke"" was Richardson's last film and his is an endearing and genuine performance.It was also ""Highlander"" Christopher Lambert's first English-speaking role. He plays John Clayton/Tarzan with an inborn dignity, even while engaging in ape antics. (The younger Tarzan is played by a swimming champion.) He does a great job of presenting a character that was raised in the wild, without human contact. As an adult, he is constantly conflicted despite some joyful moments. The class segregation of Edwardian England was rigid - think first season ""Downton Abbey; it was not the culture to accept a wild child. As an eccentric member of the aristocracy, young Greystoke can get away with it ... almost. Heartbreaking moments come for John/Tarzan when he can't accept that extremely prejudiced society that considers itself civilized.Andie McDowell also made her screen-acting debut in ""Greystoke"" as Jane, Tarzan's love interest. It was a casting move that heightened the chemistry between her and Lambert. The studio, however, had her voice dubbed by Glen Close. Close also voiced Kala, Tarzan's ape mother.The movie was originally released in Dolby stereo with a 70mm, 6-track soundtrack. It has been upgraded to an immersive DTS-HD MA 5.1 mix that provides better than average separation. Dialogue, animal noises, and score mix very well.Commentary from director Hugh Hudson (""Chariots of Fire,"" ""I Dreamed of Africa"") and associate producer Garth Thomas is passionate and loaded with detail. Created for the 20th Anniversary DVD, it's the only extra on the disc and definitely worth hearing. Hudson's intention was to make the film as realistic as possible, but conflicts with Towne (""Chinatown"") caused the writer to substitute his onscreen credit with his dog's name, P.H. Vazak.While the story is supposed to be more like Burroughs' book, the script takes liberties, especially in the tone which relies more on mood than action. Think of it as an ""Ode to the Jungle Lord."" We never hear the name ""Tarzan"" spoken in the film; his grandfather calls him ""Johnnie."" The score is symphonic, relying on original music from John Scott and Elgar's First Symphony.Two endings were filmed, one where Jane returns to England, one where she joins Tarzan in the jungle according to American tradition. The director chose the most lifelike as possible. Still, in the end, it's the audience who decides.For me, she stays!-- Kay Reynolds",4,'Greystoke' - Burroughs' Lord of the Apes is king on Blu-ray,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,3926,"['THIS', 'FILM', 'ABOUT', 'baby', 'born', 'African', 'jungle', 'raised', 'apes', 'then', 'brought', 'adult', 'strict', 'Edwardian', 'society', 'was', 'made', 'high-def', 'Filmed', 'mostly', 'Cameroon', 'Scotland', 'color', 'gorgeous', 'lush', 'jungle', 'panoramas', 'contrasted', 'cool', 'grey-washed', 'vistas', 'Highlands', 'Obviously', 'remastered', 'high-def', 'master', '1080p', 'Blu-ray', 'shows', 'sign', 'digital', 'manipulation', 'dirt', 'scratches', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'Details', 'Tarzan', 'scars', 'fur', 'amazing', 'wolfhounds', 'maggots', 'are', 'fed', 'ape', 'mechanism', 'look', 'exceptionally', 'realistic.That', 'said', 'Tarzan', 'ape', 'family', 'sketchy', 'now', 'especially', 'age', 'motion-capture', 'CGI', 'Consider', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', '2011', 'apes', 'creation', 'Greystoke', 'are', 'larger', 'chimpanzees', 'yet', 'smaller', 'gorillas', 'Seven-time', 'Oscar-winning', 'effects', 'artist', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'designed', 'costumes', 'actors', 'larger', '5-foot', '5', 'ape-actors', 'then', 'spent', 'months', 'training', 'perfect', 'simian', 'mannerisms', 'was', 'cutting-edge', 'time', 'earned', 'Baker', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Makeup', 'Paul', 'Engelen', 'Robert', 'Towne', 'Michael', 'Austin', 'were', 'also', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Screenplay', 'Based', 'Material', 'Medium', 'case', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'Tarzan', 'Lord', 'Apes', 'adventure', 'novels', 'Sir', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'who', 'Sixth', 'Earl', 'Greystoke', 'Tarzan', 'grandfather', 'earned', 'posthumous', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Greystoke', 'was', 'Richardson', 'last', 'film', 'endearing', 'genuine', 'performance.It', 'was', 'also', 'Highlander', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'first', 'English-speaking', 'role', 'John', 'Clayton/Tarzan', 'inborn', 'dignity', 'even', 'engaging', 'ape', 'antics', 'younger', 'Tarzan', 'played', 'swimming', 'champion', 'great', 'job', 'presenting', 'character', 'was', 'raised', 'wild', 'human', 'contact', 'adult', 'constantly', 'conflicted', 'joyful', 'moments', 'class', 'segregation', 'Edwardian', 'England', 'was', 'rigid', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'was', 'not', 'culture', 'accept', 'wild', 'child', 'eccentric', 'member', 'aristocracy', 'young', 'Greystoke', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'almost', 'Heartbreaking', 'moments', 'come', 'John/Tarzan', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'extremely', 'prejudiced', 'society', 'civilized.Andie', 'McDowell', 'also', 'made', 'screen-acting', 'debut', 'Greystoke', 'Jane', 'Tarzan', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'casting', 'move', 'heightened', 'chemistry', 'Lambert', 'studio', 'however', 'had', 'voice', 'dubbed', 'Glen', 'Close', 'Close', 'also', 'voiced', 'Kala', 'Tarzan', 'ape', 'mother.The', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'Dolby', 'stereo', '70mm', '6-track', 'soundtrack', 'been', 'upgraded', 'immersive', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'mix', 'better', 'average', 'separation', 'Dialogue', 'animal', 'noises', 'score', 'mix', 'very', 'well.Commentary', 'director', 'Hugh', 'Hudson', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'Dreamed', 'Africa', 'associate', 'producer', 'Garth', 'Thomas', 'passionate', 'loaded', 'detail', 'Created', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'DVD', 'only', 'extra', 'disc', 'definitely', 'worth', 'hearing', 'Hudson', 'intention', 'was', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'conflicts', 'Towne', 'Chinatown', 'caused', 'writer', 'substitute', 'onscreen', 'credit', 'dog', 'name', 'P.H', 'Vazak.While', 'story', 'supposed', 'be', 'more', 'Burroughs', 'book', 'script', 'liberties', 'especially', 'tone', 'more', 'mood', 'action', 'Think', 'Ode', 'Jungle', 'Lord', 'never', 'hear', 'name', 'Tarzan', 'spoken', 'film', 'grandfather', 'Johnnie', 'score', 'symphonic', 'relying', 'original', 'music', 'John', 'Scott', 'Elgar', 'First', 'Symphony.Two', 'endings', 'were', 'filmed', 'one', 'where', 'Jane', 'England', 'one', 'where', 'Tarzan', 'jungle', 'according', 'American', 'tradition', 'director', 'chose', 'most', 'lifelike', 'possible', 'Still', 'end', 'audience', 'who', 'Kay', 'Reynolds']",N/A

236658,AYFZ6RAXGZTMV,6300270351,Michael D Ward,"[14, 25]","Even though it doesn't really bear on the quality (or lack there of) of this movie, I'd like to clear up a very common misconception about this film.It is absolutley nothing like the novel on which it is supposedly based.  However, for some reason people who appearantly mistook the Greystoke press release for Burrough's novel continue to perpetuate the myth that this is a faithful adaption of the novel.  Even Disney's _Tarzan_ which deviated greatly from the novel itself had more simularities to it than this.Of course this doesn't make Greystoke a bad movie.  However, it is disappointing that no film has ever told the story of Burrough's book because _Tarzan_ was not only a very good novel, it is the kind of novel that would make an incredible film if anyone would ever bother to film it rather than simply borrow its title character.As for _Greystoke_, it's best near the begining when Tarzan is in the jungle, but it just becomes tedious once the story moves to England.It's hard to articulate exactly what is wrong with this film.  It isn't so much that anything is wrong with it, but there is so very little good about it.  The idea of a story about a man who grew up as an ape trying to become a man sounds compelling, but on the screen it gets old fast.Lambert and MacDowell don't help much with performances which like the film aren't really bad but aren't good either.  Lambert to often makes it obvious that he is acting and the fact that MacDowell had to be dubbed by Glenn Close doesn't help her performance.Ralph Richardson on the other hand gives a very good performance and carries the parts of the film he has the misfortune of being in.The ending is completely unsatisfying.  It tries for the same bittersweet quality of the novel's ending, but because the film so firmly establishes that Tarzan is out of place in the world of man, it has trouble coming to a sensible conclusion.Hopefully, Hollywood will someday make a good version of _Tarzan_, but this isn't it.  But don't take my word for it.  Screenwriter Robert Towne was so disastified with the final film that he had his name taken of the picture. Instead the screenplay was credited P. H. Vazak, the name of Towne's dog.

Bringing another era to life is difficult and they brought that off beautifully.Not being overly familiar with Robert Towne's other work, aside from Chinatown & Personal Best - or his trials & tribulations in trying to get this film made - I had no expectations of ""greatness"".  Could it have been a better film?  Well, I think the fault must lie with the director, Hugh Hudson.  Chariots of Fire is a slow, somewhat stiff film, starchy in its look and performances, and ""Greystoke"", which I believe was Hudson's follow-up after the huge success of Chariots, suffers from this to a lesser extent, too.  But the actors'  performances in Greystoke, particularly Richardson's, do help in lifting it away from that.  I think of the movie as more of a romantic soap opera than anything else, and a pretty enjoyable one too.

236675,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6300270351,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[68, 69]","Although it doesn't quite live up to Robert Towne's original script, ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan Lord of The Apes"" manages to bring much of the spectacle of Edgar Rice Burroughs' original tale with a distinctive, powerful edge missing from every other version of the novel. Towne's script and the film adhere to most of the narrative about Tarzan growing up while drifting away from some of the more extreme fantasy elements present in the original novel.When the child of a female gorilla is mercilessly beaten to death, his mother adopts an infant human whose parents were killed by the same gorilla. The couple were shipwrecked and thought dead by the man's grandfather the Earl of Greystoke. The infant continues to have conflicts with the lead gorilla of the group as he grows up and is, in fact, beaten up and left for dead at one point. As he grows into manhood, he discovers the home of his parents, his mother's locket, and his father's knife and sees his reflection for the first time. He's horrified and fascinated at the same time realizing that, while he doesn't quite look like his mother, she is still his mother. Gradually, he discovers children's blocks that show him what a human looks like for the first time.When his mother is murdered by tribesmen hunting the gorillas for food, he fights back for the first time killing one of the tribesmen breaking the man's back. He also stands up to and kills the gorilla that tried to kill him and succeeded in killing his parents long ago. Tarzan (Christopher Lambert in his debut) is discovered by a French explorer (Ian Holm from ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"") who takes pity on the young man and brings him back to civilization discovering along the way that Tarzan is, indeed, the son of the missing heir to the Greystoke fortune and title.The film moves Tarzan from the animal kingdom to the civilized world where the collision between how he was raised and who he has to become creates considerable conflict. Later, he meets and falls in love with Jane (Andie McDowell in her film debut but with her voice over dubbed by Glenn Close)but the conflicts between the civilized world and his experience continues to threaten their relationship and his inheritance.Directed by Hugh Hudson (""Chariots of Fire"", ""I Dreamed of Africa""), the film generated much controversy when writer Robert Towne (""Chinatown"", ""Personal Best"", ""Tequila Sunrise"" and ""Shampoo"") took his name off the credits substituting the name of his dog. Towne felt that Hudson (and the screenwriter Hudson brought in Michael Austin) strayed a bit from his original script which had an even more epic canvas to work from. Towne had been forced to sell off ""Greystoke"" which he had intended to direct due to money issues related to his directorial debut ""Personal Best"". While the film doesn't quite live up to Towne's vision, Hudson's film is still quite compelling and powerful capturing the sweep of the epic films made by David Lean. Although the script becomes a bit uneven when Tarzan returns to civilization, Christopher Lambert's portrayal of Tarzan along with Ian Holm, Sir Ralph Richardson, James Fox and McDowell/Close keeps the film interesting. Lambert's moody, brooding and quiet performance works well at keeping Tarzan a mysterious, sensuous figure. Lambert brings an animal physical presence to the role that quickly captures your attention. The tightly directed and edited action sequences also prevent the film from lagging.Although the DVD doesn't have the type of extras it really deserves, Warner has lavished a considerable amount of money to bring us a very sharp, crisp and vivid anamorphic widescreen transfer. There's still a fair amount of analog blemishes in the form of hair and dirt but the bulk of this occurs during the opening titles. This version of the film never played theatrically in the U.S. Like the original videocassette, this version of ""Greystoke"" runs about 7 minutes longer with a prologue involving the apes and a sequence that briefly depicts Tarzan's trek to civilization. The marvelous score by John Scott has been remastered for Dolby Digital 5.1 bringing the sound up to date and we also get the beautiful Overture that greeted audiences as they walked in during the first few minutes before the movie began.We get the marvelous original theatrical trailer as part of the extras and a commentary track by Director Hudson and Associate Producer Garth Thomas. They provide some very interesting tidbits about the shooting of the film but completely avoid discussing the decision to rewrite Towne's script and only making a passing mention of the voice recasting. The commentary would have been far more interesting had both decided to revisit their decision to bring Glenn Close to dub MacDowell's lines and the decision to pare back Towne's original, more expensive vision.Although it might lack the epic vision that Towne had intended, Hudson's film still manages to make quite an impression. The film certainly has the epic feel of some of David Lean's epics and if the film becomes uneven during its second half, it still manages to swing to a satisfying conclusion.",4,Spectacular retelling
