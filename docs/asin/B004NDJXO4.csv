1420963,A301C4SBHWTJV5,B004NDJXO4,Brian P. Nestor,"[25, 25]","Tony Palmer, the director of this film (and it is a FILM, not a video) was in 1974 the premiere director working in rock, especially in Europe.  Previously Tony had worked with everyone from the Beatles to Cream to Pink Floyd.  He chose to highlight Rory Gallagher's annual Christmas tour of Ireland at a time when ""The Troubles"" were at an all-time high.  Rory was virtually the only rock musician of any stature who would play in Ireland during this time, AND he played both Dublin and Belfast.  Yet such was his stature in his native country that Rory was considered 'off limits' to terrorist attacks.Politics aside, this is a marvelous film.  Rory was peaking and his performances, especially on ""A Million Miles Away"" and 'Bullfrog Blues"", are incredible.  The audiences are beyond ecstatic, and at times it reaches an almost religious fervor.  Curiously, politics are never mentioned.  Rory talks about growing up and his influences and demonstrates on his acoustic and his dobro.  There is plenty of dressing room footage to show what a focused individual he was when it came to his music.  And the music has Rory smoking, the absolutely best blues rock player ever on the planet.In addition, the transfer is an improvement on the older DVD, and the sound pounds, as it should.  There are some great extra features, including a wonderful and touching commentary by his brother and manager, Donal Gallagher, and his long time bass player Gerry McAvoy, the two individuals who knew him longest and best.  A short 30 minute feature for Irish TV from 1972 is also included in spectacular quality, and features some more interviews and performances that are also high quality and worthy of inclusion.  And there is some home movies from the Japanese tour from shortly after the completion of the film.While Rory had a long and magnificent career, and the recent documentary ""Ghost Blues"" does an excellent job of covering that, ""Irish Tour '74 highlights the bond between a committed artist and his rabid fans in a way hardly seen outside of Beatlemania, and does so in outstanding visual and audio quality.  Nearly every performance of his is worth checking out, but if I had to pick only one, without a doubt this is the document that shows the magic Rory performed before an audience every night he performed.Ghost Blues: The Story of Rory Gallagher & the Beat Club SessionsRory Gallagher: Live at MontreuxRory Gallagher: Live at RockpalastRory Gallagher : Live In Cork",5,The Definitive Document on an Underrated Genius,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,2474,"['Tony', 'Palmer', 'director', 'film', 'FILM', 'not', 'video', 'was', '1974', 'premiere', 'director', 'working', 'rock', 'especially', 'Europe', 'Previously', 'Tony', 'had', 'worked', 'everyone', 'Beatles', 'Cream', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'chose', 'highlight', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'tour', 'Ireland', 'time', 'when', 'Troubles', 'were', 'all-time', 'high', 'Rory', 'was', 'virtually', 'only', 'rock', 'musician', 'stature', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'Ireland', 'time', 'played', 'Dublin', 'Belfast', 'such', 'was', 'stature', 'native', 'country', 'Rory', 'was', 'considered', ""'off"", 'limits', 'terrorist', 'attacks.Politics', 'aside', 'marvelous', 'film', 'Rory', 'was', 'peaking', 'performances', 'especially', 'Million', 'Miles', 'Away', 'Blues', 'are', 'incredible', 'audiences', 'are', 'ecstatic', 'times', 'almost', 'religious', 'fervor', 'Curiously', 'politics', 'are', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Rory', 'talks', 'growing', 'up', 'influences', 'acoustic', 'dobro', 'plenty', 'dressing', 'room', 'footage', 'show', 'what', 'focused', 'individual', 'was', 'when', 'came', 'music', 'music', 'Rory', 'smoking', 'absolutely', 'best', 'blues', 'rock', 'player', 'ever', 'planet.In', 'addition', 'transfer', 'improvement', 'older', 'DVD', 'sound', 'should', 'are', 'great', 'extra', 'features', 'including', 'wonderful', 'touching', 'commentary', 'brother', 'manager', 'Donal', 'Gallagher', 'long', 'time', 'bass', 'player', 'Gerry', 'McAvoy', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'knew', 'longest', 'best', 'short', '30', 'minute', 'feature', 'Irish', 'TV', '1972', 'also', 'included', 'spectacular', 'quality', 'more', 'interviews', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'high', 'quality', 'worthy', 'inclusion', 'home', 'movies', 'Japanese', 'tour', 'shortly', 'completion', 'film.While', 'Rory', 'had', 'long', 'magnificent', 'career', 'recent', 'documentary', 'Ghost', 'Blues', 'excellent', 'job', 'covering', 'Irish', 'Tour', 'highlights', 'bond', 'committed', 'artist', 'rabid', 'fans', 'way', 'hardly', 'seen', 'Beatlemania', 'so', 'outstanding', 'visual', 'audio', 'quality', 'Nearly', 'performance', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'had', 'pick', 'only', 'one', 'doubt', 'document', 'magic', 'Rory', 'performed', 'audience', 'night', 'performed.Ghost', 'Blues', 'Story', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'Beat', 'Club', 'SessionsRory', 'Gallagher', 'Live', 'MontreuxRory', 'Gallagher', 'Live', 'RockpalastRory', 'Gallagher', 'Live', 'Cork']",N/A

The picture is now in what seems to be its correct widescreen aspect ratio and dramatically improved....this is like comparing a remastered Beatles CD to one recorded through a pillow case...its that much better even on the standard DVD and the Blu-Ray is wonderful!  There is also a bonus half hour documentary on Rory that features another batch of great performances...seriously this should be a no-brainer for fans of this gifted musician.The question is...do I upgrade..YES!If you love seriously wonderful electric blues..YESIf you are a fan of Rory Gallagher...what are you waiting for?I do need to add that there are several great Rory Gallagher DVD compilations on the market now from Rockpalast to Montreux that have more performances than this film....but this is a film and an artistic one which really takes you into the sweaty clubs of '74 Ireland and backstage which is a treat. Of course the film maker is an artist and he does show sweaty faces instead of fingers and guitars and does add shots of Rory during songs that may make visual sense to him  but are obviously NOT the song he is playing as his guitar is changed and the slide is missing etc...but its very creative and fun.,5,DRAMATIC improvement in picture quality and bonus features!,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,1321,"['have', 'original', 'releaseRory', 'Gallagher', 'Irish', 'Tour', '1974and', 'enjoy', '..this', 'will', 'be', 'wonderful', 'news', 'picture', 'now', 'what', 'be', 'correct', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'dramatically', 'improved', 'comparing', 'remastered', 'Beatles', 'CD', 'one', 'recorded', 'pillow', 'case', 'much', 'better', 'even', 'standard', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'wonderful', 'also', 'bonus', 'half', 'hour', 'documentary', 'Rory', 'batch', 'great', 'performances', 'seriously', 'should', 'be', 'no-brainer', 'fans', 'gifted', 'musician.The', 'question', 'do', 'upgrade..YES', 'love', 'seriously', 'wonderful', 'electric', 'blues..YESIf', 'are', 'fan', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'what', 'are', 'waiting', 'do', 'add', 'are', 'several', 'great', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'DVD', 'compilations', 'market', 'now', 'Rockpalast', 'Montreux', 'have', 'more', 'performances', 'film', '.but', 'film', 'artistic', 'one', 'really', 'sweaty', 'clubs', ""'74"", 'Ireland', 'backstage', 'treat', 'course', 'film', 'maker', 'artist', 'show', 'sweaty', 'instead', 'fingers', 'guitars', 'add', 'shots', 'Rory', 'songs', 'may', 'make', 'visual', 'sense', 'are', 'obviously', 'NOT', 'song', 'playing', 'guitar', 'changed', 'slide', 'missing', 'etc', 'very', 'creative', 'fun']",N/A

And when I do expose Rory Gallagher's catolog to the great unwashed, I am always asked, ""Why wasn't Rory Gallagher popular here in the states?"" I don't have the exact answer but it may have something to do with Rory not being a pop act the way Clapton was. Clapton was great at playing the blues but most of Clapton's successes were pop songs. Rory never went near the pop idiom; pure stripped-down blues rock. Same with Robin Trower. Neither of those guys turned out any pop turnes.So enough of my silly rant!
