As a recent convert to the Tribe of Ferguson, I was just trying to get my hands on anything he appears in. In this 1993 low-budget (and I really do mean it) documentary offering from Scottish television, we are treated to young-turk Craig as a shaggy-haired, ear-studded 30-year-old looking like a cross between a Flock of Seagulls concert attendee and an escapee from the Renaissance Faire. His rangy kinetic energy, craggy Celtic looks (far less craggy) and manic comic persona are all here, though the comic mania has been admirably tamped down due to the seriousness of the subject at hand.  The tone is a bit all over the place; turns out that the Craig persona does not blend easily with scholarly sound bites by professorial types, but who cares?  Craig is such a unique screen presence, especially with a long black coat flapping behind him as he strides all over the rain-soaked Scottish countryside, it's a feast of images the Ferguson fan won't want to miss.  Craig's gifts extend even to finding phone boxes in the most unlikely areas.Depending on your enthusiasm for looking at moss-covered stones, carvings, old pots and the like, you may find the subject matter enthalling, but I was more interested in this as a study of the Comic as a Young Man. Craig wrote all this material in addition to performing on-camera duties, an early indication that this professional clown who never graduated from high school posesses an intellectual curiosity and heft that runs surprisingly broad and deep. This series is only recently available on DVD, no doubt due to Craig's raised stature as Scotland's greatest export to America since shortbread. Serious Pictish scholars will want to look elsewhere as this is only the ""Cliffs Notes History of Scotland"", but it's a must-see for Ferguson scholars, if only to poke fun at Craig's wardrobe.",3,The Comic as a Young Man,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,1958,"['3.5', 'stars', 'OK', 'confess', 'was', ""n't"", 'burning', 'interest', 'Pictish', 'culture', 'prompted', 'check', 'out', 'recent', 'convert', 'Tribe', 'Ferguson', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'hands', 'anything', '1993', 'low-budget', 'really', 'do', 'mean', 'documentary', 'offering', 'Scottish', 'television', 'are', 'treated', 'young-turk', 'Craig', 'shaggy-haired', 'ear-studded', '30-year-old', 'looking', 'cross', 'Flock', 'Seagulls', 'concert', 'attendee', 'escapee', 'Renaissance', 'Faire', 'rangy', 'kinetic', 'energy', 'craggy', 'Celtic', 'looks', 'far', 'less', 'craggy', 'manic', 'comic', 'persona', 'are', 'here', 'comic', 'mania', 'been', 'admirably', 'tamped', 'down', 'due', 'seriousness', 'subject', 'hand', 'tone', 'bit', 'place', 'out', 'Craig', 'persona', 'not', 'blend', 'easily', 'scholarly', 'sound', 'bites', 'professorial', 'types', 'who', 'Craig', 'such', 'unique', 'screen', 'presence', 'especially', 'long', 'black', 'coat', 'flapping', 'behind', 'all', 'rain-soaked', 'Scottish', 'countryside', 'feast', 'images', 'Ferguson', 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'Craig', 'gifts', 'extend', 'even', 'finding', 'phone', 'boxes', 'most', 'unlikely', 'areas.Depending', 'enthusiasm', 'looking', 'moss-covered', 'stones', 'carvings', 'old', 'pots', 'like', 'may', 'find', 'subject', 'matter', 'enthalling', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'study', 'Comic', 'Young', 'Man', 'Craig', 'wrote', 'material', 'addition', 'performing', 'on-camera', 'duties', 'early', 'indication', 'professional', 'clown', 'who', 'never', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'posesses', 'intellectual', 'curiosity', 'heft', 'surprisingly', 'broad', 'deep', 'series', 'only', 'recently', 'available', 'DVD', 'doubt', 'due', 'Craig', 'raised', 'stature', 'Scotland', 'greatest', 'export', 'America', 'shortbread', 'Serious', 'Pictish', 'scholars', 'will', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'only', 'Cliffs', 'Notes', 'History', 'Scotland', 'must-see', 'Ferguson', 'scholars', 'only', 'poke', 'fun', 'Craig', 'wardrobe']",The Dirt Detective with Craig Ferguson

It is really fun to watch. It is interesting from the standpoint of seeing things like the best preserved 5,000 year old Neolithic settlement in Europe. Even back then Craig Ferguson marched to the beat of a different drummer, and he is funny to watch.These DVDs do not have subtitles. Even though Craig Ferguson and all the people he interviews are speaking the Queen's English, I do miss some of the words. And this is coming from a guy who owns (and wears) a real honest Scottish kilt which I bought in Scotland. And not at some tourist shop either. I have travelled widely in Scotland on several different occasions. Even so, my DVD player remote control is getting a good workout, rewinding a little and listening to a phrase or sentence again.I recommend this set of DVDs to anyone who likes archaeology, likes Scotland, or is a fan of Craig Ferguson.",5,The Dirt Detective,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,1087,"['More', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'apparent', 'seeing', 'how', 'much', 'younger', 'was', 'Scottish', 'Conan', 'guy', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', 'hosted', 'archaeological', 'TV', 'show', 'Scotland.This', 'six', 'part', 'series', 'just', 'recently', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'American', 'format', 'really', 'fun', 'watch', 'interesting', 'standpoint', 'seeing', 'things', 'best', 'preserved', '5,000', 'year', 'old', 'Neolithic', 'settlement', 'Europe', 'Even', 'back', 'then', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', 'marched', 'beat', 'different', 'drummer', 'funny', 'watch.These', 'DVDs', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'subtitles', 'Even', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', 'people', 'are', 'speaking', 'Queen', 'English', 'do', 'miss', 'words', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', 'wears', 'real', 'honest', 'Scottish', 'kilt', 'bought', 'Scotland', 'not', 'tourist', 'shop', 'have', 'travelled', 'widely', 'Scotland', 'several', 'different', 'occasions', 'Even', 'so', 'DVD', 'player', 'remote', 'control', 'getting', 'good', 'workout', 'rewinding', 'little', 'listening', 'phrase', 'sentence', 'again.I', 'recommend', 'set', 'DVDs', 'anyone', 'who', 'archaeology', 'likes', 'Scotland', 'fan', 'Craig', 'Ferguson']",The Dirt Detective with Craig Ferguson

You visit Roman ruins and baths, north islands, churches and ancient sewers. Professors and ministers help you understand what you are seeing. Craig Ferguson has the just right sense of humor to not take himself or the topic too seriously. You realize the Scots are making an effort to recognize, study and take care of their history while living in the present. You see how rocks have been moved and recycled for reuse in new buildings.
