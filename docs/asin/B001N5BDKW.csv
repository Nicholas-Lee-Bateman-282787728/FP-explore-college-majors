This is not the best video because of the technology then but I always go for these oldies because of the historical value. I have always seen JB at one time or another on a TV dance show in the 60's or some other time and venue. Although I was not really so much into that type of music as I am now, JB always sang and had moves that were amazing.I was in a Wahlgrens drug store a few months ago and walked by a bunch of DVDs that were for sale. I happened to see JB live at Montreaux in the early 80's and thought what the heck. I took it home and yes that was good even for a guy his age he still had the moves and the voice.So I plopped the money down for this and yes I do like it. All I have to say is that this is funk, blues, gospel and just plain a great performance. Filmed right after MLK's assination. The mayor of Boston comes on stage to say a few words and JB has a speech which really all reflected the times in the latter 60'sBuy this for the historical value alone and then sit back, watch and listen to a master do his thing.",4,In his prime throughout his entire career,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,1149,"['title', 'true', 'view', 'will', 'say', 'really', 'seeing', 'JB', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'was', 'wild', 'man', 'not', 'best', 'video', 'technology', 'then', 'always', 'go', 'oldies', 'historical', 'value', 'have', 'always', 'seen', 'JB', 'one', 'time', 'TV', 'dance', 'show', '60', 'other', 'time', 'venue', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'so', 'much', 'type', 'music', 'am', 'now', 'JB', 'always', 'sang', 'had', 'moves', 'were', 'was', 'Wahlgrens', 'drug', 'store', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'walked', 'bunch', 'DVDs', 'were', 'sale', 'happened', 'see', 'JB', 'live', 'Montreaux', 'early', '80', 'thought', 'what', 'heck', 'took', 'home', 'yes', 'was', 'good', 'even', 'guy', 'age', 'still', 'had', 'moves', 'voice.So', 'plopped', 'money', 'down', 'yes', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'funk', 'blues', 'gospel', 'just', 'plain', 'great', 'performance', 'Filmed', 'right', 'MLK', 'assination', 'mayor', 'Boston', 'stage', 'say', 'few', 'words', 'JB', 'speech', 'really', 'reflected', 'times', 'latter', ""60'sBuy"", 'historical', 'value', 'alone', 'then', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'listen', 'master', 'do', 'thing']",N/A

1219060,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,B001N5BDKW,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[5, 6]","seems like every time he DROPS to one knee, and James does DROP, no punches pulled, amazed he still had knees left at the end, his pants leg all dusty, but he DROPS to one knee, the director cut to a camera in the back, as if he was going to start some Jimi Hendrix kinda of bump and grind thingie on the floor.This is James, not Jimi; he drops, with style, and grace.And the way they left the cameras off during his opening speech, about every time a brother is hurt in the ghetto, he feels it, because he is of the ghetto, and about how he started off as a three cent shoe shine boy and worked up to six cents, that speech needs seeing and hearing far more even than Mayor White's cry for interracial peace that night.But the cameras were not yet on.This is James Brown, y'all.Ain't nothing but a party.Okay, so it is after his huge shows, after so many of his records had become standard in the ghetto (not outside) and for years of his being king of the Apollo, but this is still James Brown.Mostly it is just a groove show, with the best band in Rock and Roll (INCLUDING Maceo Parker!!) cooking, real tight, grooving, while Mr. Brown screams and wails, this is a tight show, ready to drop on a dime into any of his hits.But he is not really putting up his hits like a juke box playing record after record. Mostly he sings a verse, a chorus from a hit and moves on, back into that groove. and dog it is hot, that groove, laid back, cooking.This is what Jimi coulda been doing if he had not run off with the british boys to get his head destroyed, and then die, too.That night Jimi was playing blues with BB King, mourning together the killing of our Reverend Doctor King, and my my my that is the show that should have been recorded, so we could all mourn forever too.Here we have the later James Brown doing his show instead. Mayor White figured putting on this nonpolitical minstrel show would save his city from burning. Bread and Circus like the ancient Romans, to keep the plebs from revolting.Hardly anyone is there  in the big stadium.But the show is well taped, fairly well recorded; watch them work.Nothing but miking here. .No electronics, just real real. That drummer keeps on and on with that beat, right on time every time, and ready to bust out at a moment's notice, a flick of the wrist from the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, who himself works real hard and comes out to work some more and more and never gets tired, but comes back strong.What I like is when the Boston City Police in their long leather coats start throwing, literally, people off the stage, James stops them and says, I'll be all right. The spirit of King comes through, and he stops the police from their violence against the people, and let's everyone who wants come up on stage and then gets on with the show. I mean James came up form performing out on the streets, where everyone gets in with you, and then the tiny clubs, and everyone is right there with you, and then the Apollo, where the crowd will throw you off the stage if you do not do it right, and on time and strong.SO a little Boston crowd was just a nice night out for James and his tight band, complete with strings, and a shake dancer in the back in gogo boots waving her all raised sleeves like an angel.And he was all right.We never again will see such, ever again, and this was just about the last we could see of James.Please see as well the GREAT movieTalk to Me (Widescreen Edition)which steals this show from Mayor White's Boston and moves it to DC, with Petey Greene, and a fifty plus James Brown imitator doing the high kick OVER the mike, see it!See also, of course the grandson of the godfather of soul out for a little night on the town eight years later, a little night music, inThe Mothership Connection Live 1976",5,Technically just fine except for when the director switched off the cameras or switched to the wrong camera,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,3792,"['time', 'one', 'knee', 'James', 'DROP', 'punches', 'pulled', 'amazed', 'still', 'had', 'knees', 'left', 'end', 'pants', 'leg', 'dusty', 'one', 'knee', 'director', 'cut', 'camera', 'back', 'was', 'going', 'start', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'kinda', 'bump', 'grind', 'thingie', 'floor.This', 'James', 'not', 'Jimi', 'style', 'grace.And', 'way', 'left', 'cameras', 'off', 'opening', 'speech', 'time', 'brother', 'hurt', 'ghetto', 'ghetto', 'how', 'started', 'off', 'three', 'cent', 'shoe', 'shine', 'boy', 'worked', 'up', 'six', 'cents', 'speech', 'needs', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'far', 'more', 'even', 'Mayor', 'White', 'cry', 'interracial', 'peace', 'cameras', 'were', 'not', 'yet', 'on.This', 'James', 'Brown', ""y'all.Ai"", ""n't"", 'nothing', 'party.Okay', 'huge', 'shows', 'so', 'many', 'records', 'had', 'become', 'standard', 'ghetto', 'not', 'years', 'being', 'king', 'Apollo', 'still', 'James', 'Brown.Mostly', 'just', 'groove', 'show', 'best', 'band', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'INCLUDING', 'Maceo', 'Parker', 'cooking', 'real', 'tight', 'grooving', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'screams', 'wails', 'tight', 'show', 'ready', 'drop', 'dime', 'hits.But', 'not', 'really', 'putting', 'up', 'hits', 'juke', 'box', 'playing', 'record', 'record', 'Mostly', 'verse', 'chorus', 'hit', 'moves', 'back', 'groove', 'dog', 'hot', 'groove', 'laid', 'back', 'cooking.This', 'what', 'Jimi', 'coulda', 'been', 'doing', 'had', 'not', 'run', 'off', 'british', 'boys', 'get', 'head', 'destroyed', 'then', 'die', 'too.That', 'night', 'Jimi', 'was', 'playing', 'blues', 'BB', 'King', 'mourning', 'together', 'killing', 'Reverend', 'Doctor', 'King', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'could', 'mourn', 'forever', 'too.Here', 'have', 'later', 'James', 'Brown', 'doing', 'show', 'instead', 'Mayor', 'White', 'figured', 'putting', 'nonpolitical', 'minstrel', 'show', 'would', 'save', 'city', 'burning', 'Bread', 'Circus', 'ancient', 'Romans', 'keep', 'plebs', 'revolting.Hardly', 'anyone', 'there', 'big', 'stadium.But', 'show', 'well', 'taped', 'fairly', 'well', 'recorded', 'watch', 'work.Nothing', 'miking', 'here', '.No', 'electronics', 'just', 'real', 'real', 'drummer', 'keeps', 'beat', 'right', 'time', 'time', 'ready', 'bust', 'out', 'moment', 'notice', 'flick', 'wrist', 'Hardest', 'Working', 'Man', 'Show', 'Business', 'who', 'real', 'hard', 'out', 'work', 'more', 'more', 'never', 'tired', 'back', 'strong.What', 'like', 'when', 'Boston', 'City', 'Police', 'long', 'leather', 'coats', 'start', 'throwing', 'literally', 'people', 'stage', 'James', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'spirit', 'King', 'police', 'violence', 'people', 'let', 'everyone', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'stage', 'then', 'show', 'mean', 'James', 'came', 'up', 'form', 'performing', 'out', 'streets', 'where', 'everyone', 'then', 'tiny', 'clubs', 'everyone', 'right', 'there', 'then', 'Apollo', 'where', 'crowd', 'will', 'throw', 'off', 'stage', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'right', 'time', 'strong.SO', 'little', 'Boston', 'crowd', 'was', 'just', 'nice', 'night', 'out', 'James', 'tight', 'band', 'complete', 'strings', 'shake', 'dancer', 'back', 'gogo', 'boots', 'waving', 'raised', 'sleeves', 'angel.And', 'was', 'right.We', 'never', 'again', 'will', 'see', 'such', 'ever', 'again', 'was', 'just', 'last', 'could', 'see', 'James.Please', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'GREAT', 'movieTalk', 'Me', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'show', 'Mayor', 'White', 'Boston', 'DC', 'Petey', 'Greene', 'fifty', 'James', 'Brown', 'imitator', 'doing', 'high', 'kick', 'mike', 'see', 'See', 'also', 'course', 'grandson', 'godfather', 'soul', 'little', 'night', 'town', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'little', 'night', 'music', 'inThe', 'Mothership', 'Connection', 'Live', '1976']",N/A

When I saw this peformance listed on Amazon and read some of the reviews, I couldn't wait to get the DVD. What a disappointment!First of all, the disc I received was defective.  The last two songs would not play, and my BluRay player started making a clicking sound like the laser head was banging against the wall.  Second, I knew the concert was filmed in black and white, but I wasn't expecting the lighting to be so bad.  It looked like the theatre lights were turned off. Besides James, most everything else was a shadow. Third, the camera angles were beyond amateurish. There were a lot shots taken from behind with the view of James partially blocked.  Some of the shots didn't show his feet until the dance moves were almost over.  Fourth, the quality of the sound was poor.
