Nevertheless,  the video quality, though not bad at all, might have been improved if done  with IMAX cameras, such as it has been done with whales or sharks. Anyhow,  the information provided and some shots, like the helicopter chases or the  tiger cub at it's den, make this documentary worthwhile.",4,Professional Job.

Hedges,"[13, 13]","I have always had an interest in the big cats, and have had a particular interest in the Siberian tiger since reading the compelling book ""Tigers in the Snow"" by Peter Matthiessen and Maurice Hornocker, which I also recommend. These beautiful cats have been hunted to near extinction since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and are now extremely endangered by the twin perils of poaching and industrial deforestation.This documentary is an absolute must see for anyone who cares about the potential extinction of these magnificent creatures: it is brilliantly made and photographed, well written and narrated, and emotionally compelling. The film documents the Siberian tiger, the biggest cat on earth (males are up to ten feet long and weight up to 660 pounds) and the perils it faces. Unfortunately the single biggest peril it faces is poaching. The pelt alone can bring over $10,000 on the black market, and various other parts are used in medical quackery. I was nearly moved to tears in the introduction as video of a poaching operation was shown. The fear on the cat's face is haunting, and while I wouldn't show it to a child, I think it's important to see the senseless violence for what it is. Sadly, the Russian agents must destroy the pelts and other items of contraband made from the tigers when they catch the poachers to ensure they never get to market and support further demand for tiger products. Watching the agents burn tiger pelts was one of the saddest things I have ever seen.The bulk of the film follows Russian and American researchers working in tandem to track, study, and save these beautiful creatures. Their love for the animals is clear in the risks they take in their studies: rappelling from a helicopter into the forest with a partially sedated tiger, tagging the ear of a cub in his den while his mother hunts, giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an adult male tiger with labored breathing, etc.: we can all be glad that they take these risks in the effort to conserve the Siberian tigers, and unravel the mysteries of their lives.Also on the DVD are several bonus features including still photos and a very interesting documentary, ""Tiger's Eye,"" about photographing tigers in India. I enjoyed all the extras immensely.The Russians have an old proverb ""Hope is the last to die."" These researchers and filmmakers are doing everything in their power to keep hope alive for the Siberian tigers, and I wish them the best for us and all the future generations who deserve to know these beautiful, majestic, and endangered creatures.",5,"""Hope Is The Last To Die.""",1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,2565,"['have', 'always', 'had', 'interest', 'big', 'cats', 'have', 'had', 'particular', 'interest', 'Siberian', 'tiger', 'reading', 'compelling', 'book', 'Tigers', 'Snow', 'Peter', 'Matthiessen', 'Maurice', 'Hornocker', 'also', 'recommend', 'beautiful', 'cats', 'have', 'been', 'hunted', 'extinction', 'collapse', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'are', 'now', 'extremely', 'endangered', 'twin', 'perils', 'poaching', 'industrial', 'deforestation.This', 'documentary', 'absolute', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'potential', 'extinction', 'magnificent', 'creatures', 'brilliantly', 'made', 'photographed', 'well', 'written', 'narrated', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'film', 'documents', 'Siberian', 'tiger', 'biggest', 'cat', 'earth', 'males', 'are', 'up', 'ten', 'feet', 'long', 'weight', 'up', '660', 'pounds', 'perils', 'Unfortunately', 'single', 'biggest', 'peril', 'poaching', 'pelt', 'alone', 'can', 'bring', 'over', '10,000', 'black', 'market', 'various', 'other', 'parts', 'are', 'used', 'medical', 'quackery', 'was', 'nearly', 'moved', 'tears', 'introduction', 'video', 'poaching', 'operation', 'was', 'shown', 'fear', 'cat', 'face', 'haunting', 'would', ""n't"", 'show', 'child', 'think', 'important', 'see', 'senseless', 'violence', 'what', 'Sadly', 'Russian', 'agents', 'must', 'destroy', 'pelts', 'other', 'items', 'contraband', 'made', 'tigers', 'when', 'catch', 'poachers', 'ensure', 'never', 'get', 'market', 'support', 'further', 'demand', 'tiger', 'products', 'Watching', 'agents', 'burn', 'tiger', 'pelts', 'was', 'one', 'saddest', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'bulk', 'film', 'Russian', 'American', 'researchers', 'working', 'tandem', 'track', 'study', 'save', 'beautiful', 'creatures', 'love', 'animals', 'clear', 'risks', 'take', 'studies', 'rappelling', 'helicopter', 'forest', 'partially', 'sedated', 'tiger', 'tagging', 'ear', 'cub', 'den', 'mother', 'hunts', 'giving', 'mouth-to-mouth', 'resuscitation', 'adult', 'male', 'tiger', 'labored', 'breathing', 'etc', 'can', 'be', 'glad', 'take', 'risks', 'effort', 'conserve', 'Siberian', 'tigers', 'unravel', 'mysteries', 'lives.Also', 'DVD', 'are', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'still', 'photos', 'very', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'Tiger', 'Eye', 'photographing', 'tigers', 'India', 'enjoyed', 'extras', 'immensely.The', 'Russians', 'have', 'old', 'proverb', 'Hope', 'last', 'die', 'researchers', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'doing', 'everything', 'power', 'keep', 'hope', 'alive', 'Siberian', 'tigers', 'wish', 'best', 'future', 'generations', 'who', 'deserve', 'know', 'beautiful', 'majestic', 'endangered', 'creatures']",N/A

Typical National Geographic production, which is to say: well made movie, nice and clear narration, clear photography. For those of you who are into watching live chases of prey by predators, there isn't much here. But you won't be bored by the documentary at all. There are many riveting moments when you are holding your breath to see what's going to happen next. This is certainly a DVD to buy and keep.At the end, I was in awe of the pioneering work being done by the Russian and American scientists portrayed in this movie.
