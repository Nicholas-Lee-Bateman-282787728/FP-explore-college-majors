I knew we wouldn't have Elmer Fudd pointing a gun in anyone's face.  I also doubted we would have any of the dynamite or falling anvils that were prevalent in the 90's with Animaniacs or Tiny Toons.  However, I certainly wasn't expecting the sitcom format they came up with.  I also wasn't expecting a 22 minute episode with the same storyline (really would have preferred 5-15 minute shorts that are prevalent on Cartoon Network with Adventure Time and Regular Show Adult Swim).Personally, I would have rated the show 1 star, 2 at very best.  However, as I read the other reviews, I realize that I'm probably not the target audience, having grown up on the classics; that's why I went middle of the road with 3 stars.  If you go into the show with no prior knowledge, you might be able to enjoy it, but I just can't.",3,An alright show unless you're expecting classic slapstick from the '60's,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,918,"['When', 'heard', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'was', 'making', 'new', 'episodes', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'Elmer', 'Fudd', 'pointing', 'gun', 'anyone', 'face', 'also', 'doubted', 'would', 'have', 'dynamite', 'falling', 'anvils', 'were', 'prevalent', '90', 'Animaniacs', 'Tiny', 'Toons', 'However', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'sitcom', 'format', 'came', 'up', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', '22', 'minute', 'episode', 'same', 'storyline', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', '5-15', 'minute', 'shorts', 'are', 'prevalent', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Adventure', 'Time', 'Regular', 'Show', 'Adult', 'Swim', '.Personally', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'show', '1', 'star', '2', 'very', 'best', 'However', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'realize', ""'m"", 'probably', 'not', 'target', 'audience', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'classics', 'why', 'went', 'middle', 'road', '3', 'stars', 'go', 'show', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'just', 'ca', ""n't""]","The Looney Tunes Show 3-Pack Fun: Season 1, Vol. 1-3"

It's been critized for it's rare use of slapstick and ""sitcom"" format but I see it as a different version that doesn't really have to follow norm with it's older counterpart series. The art looks amazing but it's a shame there is no bluray release in the foreseeable future. Sadly Warner Brothers has decided to milk the hell out of this show and release it the old ""Singles"" way with 4 episode dvds... like the title states, this could have been easily averted if they would have just released this product from the get go with 12 episodes for 18 bucks is well worth the money (even if we aren't getting a full season box yet).
