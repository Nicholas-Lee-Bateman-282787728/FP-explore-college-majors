448454,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6305107777,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","With a series of exercise tapes called &quot;The Method&quot;, Jennifer Kries leads this 60 minute workout that is segmented into three 20 minute workouts.  I consider myself new to yoga, having worked to Kathy Smith lately.  I enjoy this video tape much more.  The moves are quick and not particularly agonizing.  Jennifer is good at cueing.There is minimal distraction here as she works alone and the camera follows well.  The forms are not very difficult and its easy to see that with some practice, they can be done with precision.  Breathing correctly is the key also, as one can tend to hold the breath during more difficult moves.Her first segment is titled Strength and Vitality which concentrates developing abdominal strength.Segment 2 is Flexibility and Range of Movement and the focus is on the major muscles and joints such as hip, shoulders, pelvis, and spine.The last is Segment 3 called Serenity and Peace of Mind.  The focus here is on relaxing the mind and body through breating exercises.This is an excellent tape, it moves quickly and is effective....

448455,A2EYAHD0Z360HV,6305107777,C. Sullivan,"[2, 2]","What a great tape! I love that the workouts are only 20 minutes long, a perfect length for giving yourself a good stretch every day -- esepcially if you're training in other disciplines, like weight training &amp; cardio. Most other yoga videos are at least double the length, and I find that hard for me to fit into my workout schedule. But twenty minutes is no problem! And, a little yoga every day gets you results much faster than a lot of yoga every so often.I came to this tape after having done Ali MacGraw's Yoga Mind &amp; Body for a few months and did not find these workouts terribly challenging. But I wasn't looking to push myself as much as I was seeking the benefits of a daily yoga practice, so this tape suited me well.I don't feel Jennifer Kries rushes thru the poses at all. I mean, she has to move things along, each routine is only twenty minutes. I was grateful she fit a good variety of poses into each workout, and to do this she obviously couldn't have us holding poses for any considerable length of time. So, this isn't a &quot;sit down and s-t-r-e-t-c-h&quot; tape, but more of a &quot;get going &amp; feel the flow&quot; tape. If that's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed!I also liked that the emphasis wasn't new-agey but more athletic -- yet graceful &amp; gentle all the same. Jennifer shows some poses that beginners might consider challenging, but she offers MANY modifications and is constantly reminding you to stay within your comfort zone, and just trust that with repetiton, things'll get easier.A+ for this wonderful tape!!",5,Excellent Yoga Tape!,1023321600,"06 6, 2002",2002,1579,"['What', 'great', 'tape', 'love', 'workouts', 'are', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'perfect', 'length', 'giving', 'good', 'stretch', 'day', 'esepcially', ""'re"", 'training', 'other', 'disciplines', 'weight', 'training', 'amp', 'cardio', 'Most', 'other', 'yoga', 'videos', 'are', 'least', 'double', 'length', 'find', 'hard', 'fit', 'workout', 'schedule', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'problem', 'little', 'yoga', 'day', 'results', 'much', 'faster', 'lot', 'yoga', 'so', 'often.I', 'came', 'tape', 'having', 'done', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'Yoga', 'Mind', 'amp', 'Body', 'few', 'months', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'workouts', 'terribly', 'challenging', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'push', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'seeking', 'benefits', 'daily', 'yoga', 'practice', 'tape', 'suited', 'well.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'poses', 'mean', 'move', 'things', 'along', 'routine', 'only', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'grateful', 'fit', 'good', 'variety', 'poses', 'workout', 'do', 'obviously', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'holding', 'poses', 'considerable', 'length', 'time', 'So', ""n't"", 'quot', 's-t-r-e-t-c-h', 'quot', 'tape', 'more', 'quot', 'get', 'going', 'amp', 'feel', 'flow', 'quot', 'tape', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'also', 'liked', 'emphasis', 'was', ""n't"", 'new-agey', 'more', 'athletic', 'yet', 'graceful', 'amp', 'same', 'Jennifer', 'poses', 'beginners', 'might', 'consider', 'challenging', 'MANY', 'modifications', 'constantly', 'reminding', 'stay', 'comfort', 'zone', 'just', 'trust', 'repetiton', 'things', ""'ll"", 'get', 'easier.A+', 'wonderful', 'tape']",The Method - Precision Yoga VHS
448456,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,6305107777,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 2]","This is one of those videos I do when I want to stretch and tone rather than pump up my heart rate.  Its extremely convenient as it consists of three separate programs which are each about 20 minutes long.Program one consists mainly of sun salutations and warrior poses.  Program Two concentrates on arm and leg stretches and balancing poses.  Program Three focuses on breathing and relaxation which are great to do to induce sleep or relieve stress. I mainly practise Programs one and Program Two.For me, this tape is great to do when you don't want to go the whole nine yards and do a full 60 minutes, although obviously you can do all three programs if so desired.  The point is, this tape is great for a moderate workout.  Jennifer Kries is a great instructor, this is the yoga leg of her 'Method' triangle of Pilates, dance and yoga techniques to keep one and all in pretty good shape.  Her style is straightfoward and compelling; her good-natured encouragement and bright smile forces you to keep trying.If you are a yoga beginner, it may take a while to fully understand each pose, especially the sun salutations and warrior positions.  I whole heartedly recommend Jennifer Kries companion book to this tape and all her other Method tapes entitled:  'Pilate Plus Method' which provides adequate photos and step by step instruction and explanation on all the poses---then the minimal amount of instruction employed on this tape will be appreciated and keep the flow moving as it is so intended.",4,An Important Part of My Exercise Regime,1035331200,"10 23, 2002",2002,1500,"['one', 'videos', 'do', 'when', 'want', 'stretch', 'tone', 'rather', 'pump', 'up', 'heart', 'rate', 'extremely', 'convenient', 'three', 'separate', 'programs', 'are', '20', 'minutes', 'long.Program', 'one', 'mainly', 'sun', 'salutations', 'warrior', 'poses', 'Program', 'Two', 'concentrates', 'arm', 'leg', 'stretches', 'balancing', 'poses', 'Program', 'Three', 'focuses', 'breathing', 'relaxation', 'are', 'great', 'do', 'induce', 'sleep', 'relieve', 'stress', 'mainly', 'practise', 'Programs', 'one', 'Program', 'Two.For', 'tape', 'great', 'do', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'whole', 'nine', 'yards', 'do', 'full', '60', 'minutes', 'obviously', 'can', 'do', 'three', 'programs', 'so', 'desired', 'point', 'tape', 'great', 'moderate', 'workout', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'great', 'instructor', 'yoga', 'leg', ""'Method"", 'triangle', 'Pilates', 'dance', 'yoga', 'techniques', 'keep', 'one', 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', 'style', 'straightfoward', 'compelling', 'good-natured', 'encouragement', 'bright', 'smile', 'forces', 'keep', 'trying.If', 'are', 'yoga', 'beginner', 'may', 'take', 'while', 'fully', 'understand', 'pose', 'especially', 'sun', 'salutations', 'warrior', 'positions', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'recommend', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'companion', 'book', 'tape', 'other', 'Method', 'tapes', 'entitled', ""'Pilate"", 'Method', 'adequate', 'photos', 'step', 'step', 'instruction', 'explanation', 'poses', '-then', 'minimal', 'amount', 'instruction', 'employed', 'tape', 'will', 'be', 'appreciated', 'keep', 'flow', 'moving', 'so', 'intended']",The Method - Precision Yoga VHS

I have had this tape for some time and bought it when I was just beginning to experiment with Yoga.  So I started doing it  when I didn't know any better.  I have to agree with the other reviewers  that while this is a mid level tape it's not necessarily for the beginner.  Only if you don't mind not keeping up or just plain getting lost in a pose.  There are several poses where you can not see your TV and have to rely on  Jennifer's instructions.  I literally had to stop and memorize the poses  because I could not figure out what she wanted us to do from just listening  to her instructions.  Now that I have been doing this for awhile it seems a  breeze.  But as everyone likes to tell you, don't sweat it.  Go at your own  pace and do the bits and pieces you want to do.  Now that I have experience  it's the type of tape I put on when I want a quick yoga session, and no  annoying distractions between movements about my spiritual self.",3,If you like Jennifer Kries You'll Like this Video,957139200,"05 1, 2000",2000,1038,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'Jennifer', 'Jennifer', 'Always', 'control', 'always', 'doing', 'something', 'well', 'have', 'had', 'tape', 'time', 'bought', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'experiment', 'Yoga', 'So', 'started', 'doing', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mid', 'level', 'tape', 'not', 'necessarily', 'beginner', 'Only', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'not', 'keeping', 'up', 'just', 'plain', 'getting', 'lost', 'pose', 'are', 'several', 'poses', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'TV', 'have', 'rely', 'Jennifer', 'instructions', 'literally', 'had', 'stop', 'memorize', 'poses', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'just', 'listening', 'instructions', 'Now', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'awhile', 'breeze', 'everyone', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'sweat', 'Go', 'own', 'pace', 'do', 'bits', 'pieces', 'want', 'do', 'Now', 'have', 'experience', 'type', 'tape', 'put', 'when', 'want', 'quick', 'yoga', 'session', 'annoying', 'distractions', 'movements', 'spiritual', 'self']",The Method - Precision Yoga VHS
