It's a wonderful story about how family matter more than anything else, how one needs to consider the needs of others and do the right thing, which also means being honest to oneself, as well as to others.  An excellent buy, excellent story and one I will watch again.  Few movies are as good as this one.",5,"Excellent Movie, Moral, Clean Language, A Must See",1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,404,"['am', 'so', 'happy', 'movie', 'test', 'being', 'moral', 'story', 'bad', 'language', 'wonderful', 'story', 'how', 'family', 'matter', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'how', 'one', 'consider', 'needs', 'others', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'also', 'being', 'honest', 'oneself', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'excellent', 'buy', 'excellent', 'story', 'one', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'Few', 'movies', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'one']",Game Time - Tackling The Past DVD

A great chance to talk about what you prioritize in life and the importance of strong relationships over the material things in life.

1514868,ABC8FXLD7W528,B006G1Y620,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[0, 0]","Jake Walker is an NFL football player with everything going for him. He's loved by his fans, has a lucrative career, and seems to have it all. Then the phone call comes that changes his life: his dad has suffered a heart attack. Jake travels back to his small North Carolina hometown. But will things ever be the same? Can broken hearts forgive?In North Carolina, Jake's brother, Dean is a husband, father, and high school football coach. As a matter of fact, with his dad, he coaches the same team both he and Jake played for in high school. However, things aren't good between Dean and Jake, nor Jake and his father.When Jake unexpectedly receives a call letting him know he will no longer be playing for the same NFL team, Jake worries about his future. Football is all he has ever loved. What will become of the NFL career he fought so hard to build? Will his agent be able to sign a contract for him with another team? If not, what then? Will his injured knee hold up through another season? What will become of the newly blossoming relationship between he and Sarah, his high school girlfriend from the past whom he recently reconnected with in North Carolina?I applaud Walmart and Proctor & Gamble for producing family movies, many with great themes. That said, Game Time: Tackling the Past is one of my favorite of these movies. It combines drama and sports for an enjoyable movie that is appropriate for the entire family. There is nothing objectionable -no foul language, no violence - just an awesome family movie with an important lesson that I highly recommend!I have added this movie to my list of mom-approved movies on my Wordpress blog.
