873979,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0006SST1S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 7]","I love Joan Caulfield best for her performance in DEAR RUTH; she was never more appealing and lovely than in that wonderful movie. But about THE LADY SAYS NO, I'll say it plain: at best, it's only mildly entertaining. It's not the lead actors' fault, I don't think it is. Caulfield and David Niven do their best with what they're given. What they're given is a lackluster script. It results in a ho-hum screwball romantic comedy.The shame of it is that the premise is very decent. Caulfield plays standoffish feminist author, Dorinda Hatch, who'd just published a best-selling novel concerning the ""dangers"" of men. Sleek photographer Bill Shelby (Niven) arrives to shoot her for the cover of Life magazine, and he's instantly smitten. But each of Bill's advances is met with a snub. Ironically, it's not until he gets discouraged and turns away that the snooty Dorinda has a change of heart. There's a strong whiff of THEODORA GOES WILD, a screwball comedy in which the prim and proper Irene Dunne goes on a bender and lets her hair down. Caulfield serves up her own spin of the good girl gone wild, as she channels her inner Dunne and tears the roof off a nightclub, sets dude against dude, starts a ruckus, wrecks a marriage. It's just that Caulfield's light touch isn't as light as Irene Dunne's. Still, it's fun watching the normally demure Caulfield play the foxy maneater.For me, the heavyhanded ""comic"" sequences outweigh the good moments. The role-playing bit - in which Caulfield punishes Niven for wolf whistling as a bunch of old biddies appreciatively look on - relies on unfunny sight gags. As I understand the lesson, wolf whistling will result in one's tie getting snipped off and pie smushed onto one's face. Well, maybe if you wolf whistle at a clown. Worth watching - because it's so damn odd - is Caulfield's dream in which she's in a leopard print bikini and, in front of Niven, performs these weird gyrating motions or, as she likes to call it, dancing. The film climaxes to a tepid crescendo, with Caulfield attempting to mend the marriage she'd sabotaged. Maybe it was a sign of the times, but the big swerve is that Caulfield recants her man-hating views and opens herself to romance. THE LADY SAYS NO, when you boil it down, is pretty much a listless raspberry at feminism circa 1952. This picture is a lightweight effort, with a screenplay that's low on finesse and tired humor that half the time had me rolling my eyes. That I'm rating it 3 stars out of 5 is more because of the good will Joan Caulfield's generated from DEAR RUTH than because of her performance in this one, which is only okay. It's hard to sparkle when you're given subpar material. Why is there a DVD out on this film, while a gem like DEAR RUTH is still languishing in VHS limbo?",3,The viewer says no,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,2778,"['love', 'Joan', 'Caulfield', 'best', 'performance', 'DEAR', 'RUTH', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'appealing', 'lovely', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'THE', 'LADY', 'SAYS', 'NO', ""'ll"", 'say', 'plain', 'best', 'only', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'not', 'lead', 'actors', 'fault', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Caulfield', 'David', 'Niven', 'do', 'best', 'what', ""'re"", 'given', 'What', ""'re"", 'given', 'lackluster', 'script', 'results', 'ho-hum', 'screwball', 'romantic', 'comedy.The', 'shame', 'premise', 'very', 'decent', 'Caulfield', 'standoffish', 'feminist', 'author', 'Dorinda', 'Hatch', 'who', ""'d"", 'just', 'published', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'concerning', 'dangers', 'men', 'Sleek', 'photographer', 'Bill', 'Shelby', 'Niven', 'shoot', 'cover', 'Life', 'magazine', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'Bill', 'advances', 'met', 'snub', 'Ironically', 'not', 'discouraged', 'away', 'snooty', 'Dorinda', 'change', 'heart', 'strong', 'whiff', 'THEODORA', 'GOES', 'WILD', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'prim', 'proper', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'bender', 'hair', 'down', 'Caulfield', 'up', 'own', 'spin', 'good', 'girl', 'gone', 'wild', 'inner', 'Dunne', 'roof', 'nightclub', 'sets', 'dude', 'dude', 'ruckus', 'marriage', 'just', 'Caulfield', 'light', 'touch', ""n't"", 'as', 'light', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Still', 'fun', 'watching', 'normally', 'demure', 'Caulfield', 'play', 'foxy', 'maneater.For', 'heavyhanded', 'comic', 'sequences', 'outweigh', 'good', 'moments', 'role-playing', 'bit', 'Caulfield', 'punishes', 'Niven', 'wolf', 'whistling', 'bunch', 'old', 'biddies', 'appreciatively', 'look', 'relies', 'unfunny', 'sight', 'gags', 'understand', 'lesson', 'wolf', 'whistling', 'will', 'result', 'one', 'tie', 'getting', 'snipped', 'pie', 'smushed', 'one', 'face', 'Well', 'maybe', 'wolf', 'whistle', 'clown', 'watching', 'so', 'damn', 'odd', 'Caulfield', 'dream', 'leopard', 'print', 'bikini', 'front', 'Niven', 'weird', 'gyrating', 'motions', 'call', 'dancing', 'film', 'climaxes', 'tepid', 'crescendo', 'Caulfield', 'attempting', 'mend', 'marriage', ""'d"", 'sabotaged', 'Maybe', 'was', 'sign', 'times', 'big', 'swerve', 'Caulfield', 'man-hating', 'views', 'romance', 'THE', 'LADY', 'SAYS', 'NO', 'when', 'boil', 'down', 'pretty', 'much', 'listless', 'raspberry', 'feminism', 'circa', '1952', 'picture', 'lightweight', 'effort', 'screenplay', 'low', 'finesse', 'tired', 'humor', 'time', 'had', 'rolling', 'eyes', ""'m"", 'rating', '3', '5', 'more', 'good', 'will', 'Joan', 'Caulfield', 'generated', 'DEAR', 'RUTH', 'performance', 'one', 'only', 'okay', 'hard', 'sparkle', 'when', ""'re"", 'given', 'subpar', 'material', 'Why', 'there', 'DVD', 'out', 'film', 'gem', 'DEAR', 'RUTH', 'still', 'languishing', 'VHS', 'limbo']",The Lady Says No

During a picture taking session for the periodical Dorinda does some mugging designed to put the impudent Shelby in his place, but the latter turns the tables on her by using a daft face made by the writer as the proof for an upcoming Life cover, refusing to give the negative to her unless she allows him to kiss her, an act leading to romantic complications that raise doubts as to the sincerity of Dorinda's feminist beliefs.  The work has a simple storyline, with some fatuous scenes of slapstick, but roles are well-performed by all members of the cast, despite a great deal of predictability in the dialogue, Caulfield earning the acting laurels as she and Niven luff toward each other in romantic folly, and there are skillful turns from Henry Jones and Lenore Lonergan as a comedic still in love, although not without conflict.
