When I heard a sequel had been made I tried not to expect too much, maybe that's why I wasn't disappointed.I won't bother giving a summary of the movie, as alot of the other reviews have done that already. I thought that the supernatural happenings started alot sooner than in the original and happened alot more frequently. I love the way tension is built through the buzzing / rumbling sound which can be heard every time something is going to happen. There were several times where I yelled out loud.I think to enjoy this movie you have to forget about how good the first one is.

Not necesssarily, but better if you see that first, just to understand the story better.3. Scarier than the first one? Yes. At times.4. Which way this is better than the first? Slightly more violent at certain points. Character developement is lot better. Gradual increase in tension is superb and the male character is far more believable than Micah (the male charater in the first movie).5. Which way this is worse than the first? Mainly the number of characters. The first one has just a couple, this one has the whole family, so there is a subtle feeling that we have many people in a haunted house (not just a lonely fella). This may bring down the tension for few, but the story makes it up.Bottom line:Watch this if you are a horror flick/PA fan. This has all the scary elements of the first, story is explained better, characters are more believable (guy in this movie is not extreme like the first one; doesnt act stupidly adamant throughout the movie). Nice scares throughout the movie and not just the repitition of the fist one. So, although the theme remains the same, PA2 still delivers all the chills of PA1 and still maintains its own identity.

1357226,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B003Q6D25K,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[0, 1]","Coming off the heels of a tiny 2007 film not widely released until two years later (budget was 15,000 dollars, ended up making close to 200 million), this sequel suffers from what many filmmakers astonishingly decide to do when a taut little package turns out to be pure gold; make it bigger, and most of all, make it dumber.What was probably most shocking about the first movie is that the paranormal activity around Katie was inexplicable.  There was no apparent reason other than randomness, no apparent solution, no explanation, nothing at all.  It was just there, haunting HER and not her house, and tormenting her for the demonic lulz.The mystery of it all was probably one of the strongest parts of what would otherwise be a conventional horror film (shot unconventionally).  Few things sap the intrigue and suspense from a horror film more than seeing the main character talking to ""ghost experts"" or researching at the library, uncovering everything about the supernatural whatever.  The Ring was great and all, but I find it hard to take a ghosty girl seriously when she died in the 1980s in a conventional way, and just didn't like horses because they were noisy.  It gets particularly annoying when mystery films or shows neatly wrap everything up with full-fledged explanations for every little clue, detail, motive, etcetera.  Part of the reason I love Law and Order (original) and dislike Law and Order Criminal Intent is that the vast majority of the time (in original) you NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN if the person on trial really did the crime.  You are left in the same position as real life; something bad happened, and someone got punished (or escaped punishment) based on the decision of 12 random people.Instead, this film would rather treat the audience as dumb, and have every facet of the film series in general explained and actions taken made very explicitly clear even early on in the film.  It made for a very disappointing film experience.First thing's first; it's scary, like the first film.  In my opinion, though, they reached too far, and the terror factor was diminished by the ""embiggening"" of the paranormal activity.  Things randomly moving on their own, doors creaking slightly, footsteps and noises occurring, sheets fluttering as if someone invisible were sliding into bed with you, people seemingly posessed and standing in place for hours on end, these were frightening, and present in both films.  This one adds more ""stuff"", more things moving around, more blatant ""presences"", more expensive set-pieces (like every drawer and cabinet in the kitchen bursting open at once).It wasn't too big of a deal, not nearly enough to use ""less is more"" as a complaint.  Instead, I use it as a complaint with regards to story.In the first movie, we meet Katie and Micah, a young couple with a camera, who start talking about ghosts and hauntings very early into the film.  The camera is set up to try and catch some of this activity, though it's not explained why until later.  The details unraveled are essentially: It's not a ghost, it's a demon, and it's not stuck to the house, but is after Katie herself, and will follow her no matter where she lives.How, why, nothing else is answered.  Nothing else is explained beyond this.  The demon has a partly-burnt photo of Katie as a little girl that it leaves in the attic to spook them.  How, why, nothing is answered.  The only apparent link was with some woman who experienced nearly identical hauntings decades earlier until she died.  Anything else related to that is not explained.In this film, it is established that the new girl, Kristi, is Katie's sister, and the events here are taking place 2 months before the events of the first film.  Same MO, slightly different spook-tactics, this time with a new factor; a baby boy.Close to the middle, but somewhat before that, in the movie, you're pretty much informed outright that the demon is after the baby, Hunter, despite what daughter Ali's boyfriend would deduce after tricking her with the ouija board (pussyhunt).  After a long period of spooky-haunting stuff, the real appeal of this movie, they begin tying it in to the first movie by providing explanation as to why the demon is haunting her, and providing a pathetically flimsy out that mirrors that of The Ring 2---turns out Kristi's demonic haunting is passed on to Katie, as depicted in the first film.Then adding the ""sequel"" bit to the ""sequel-prequel"" billing, Katie appears in their home, presumably moments after the events of the first film.  What transpires is pretty much pointless and no longer scary.But it's a franchise now.  I say that these expository events that excise all the mystery and terror of the unknown would have enhanced the movie... and yet I realize, without these things, the movie would essentially be a remake of the first.  It would've been great in hindsight if all these connections with the first movie were left unspoken, but even I don't think I would be able to put it together without the exposition.So basically, the explanations and the mystery-killing nature of it is essential for this film to even exist without being derided as a pointless cash-grabby remake.  It ruins the first film a bit (for me at least) but it gives THIS film its purpose.  It could still arguably be called a pointless cash-grabby remake, but it would at least fit in to the franchise as it stands now.  It's still interesting, but it's no longer scary.",3,Less could have been more,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,5467,"['Coming', 'off', 'heels', 'tiny', '2007', 'film', 'not', 'widely', 'released',

1357232,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003Q6D25K,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Paranormal Activity 2 is the sequel with really no improvements whatsoever.  However because I love the series, I can't help but give it a perfect 5-star rating anyway.  I honestly, truly believe anyone who's a fan of the Amityville Horror (the original one) will LOVE the Paranormal Activity series.  Alright, so Paranormal Activity doesn't necessarily wrap a storyline around these paranormal events, but then again, it's not really supposed to-  it's all about building horror and finding the creepiest ways imaginable to get underneath the sensitive side of the viewers.So why isn't the sequel better than the first one?  Well a couple reasons.  Now we have children.  Two children- one a teenage girl; the other a baby who spends most of his time in a crib.  We also have a German Shepherd always on alert.  PLUS the parents and the wifes sister.  Yes, with all these people involved, you can't possibly have a movie deliver with the suspense in the same way as the first one.  The simplicity of the setting and including only two people (a young couple) makes the first one much scarier.Also, another reason it's not as scary- the camera angles.  Whereas on the first Paranormal Activity the camera is mainly locked into one specific spot in the bedroom where the man and woman sleep, now the camera has a few other permanent positions, such as the baby's room above the crib, the living room/kitchen area, the swimming pool outback, and the hallway near the front door.  This means whenever the tension is about to build, the cameras alternate between all four of these areas.  I prefer the way it was done in the original.  That way we'd learn to appreciate and grow accustomed to the setting and the frightening scenes as our eyes absorbed into the darkness of the bedroom waiting anxiously for the next horrific scene.  With a camera switching between four different areas of the house, now there's not as much build-up in the suspense.On a similar note, it's amazing how brilliant the horror aspect works in a movie like this.  It's so simple and yet, a genius idea!  You learn to understand how the camera system works- when everything gets quiet and we return to a familiar camera position, you *know* something scary is about to happen, but there's never any telling what the actual scary moment will BE.  It could be anything!  There's literally hundreds of ideas the movie writers could have implemented.  I love it!Actually a third reason this isn't as scary as the first one is because now we know what to expect.  Honestly the movie writers should have kept this in mind because the first 3 or 4 paranormal scenes are VERY predictable and remarkably tame in comparison to even the mildest ones from the first Paranormal Activity film.  I don't want to spoil what they actually are in case you haven't seen them yet, so just know the BIG shocks won't appear until later.  Oh well- at least the movie doesn't take a while to get going this time around- you only have to wait 15 minutes until something unusual happens, whereas in the first one you had to wait 30 minutes.Now onto the positives-I have both Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 on DVD, and part two has *drastically* louder and better sound overall.  Honestly the first one is quite mild in the sound category, so you have to make constant adjustments on your volume button.  With part one, I recommend just turning it up louder than you normally would and leave it be.  With part two... you should probably turn the volume down a few notches.  With naturally louder volume, when the unexpected horror segments arrive, get ready to be REALLY scared!  I mean downright shocked!  I love it!Overall however, the amount of terrifying segments just aren't as numerous as in the first film.  Plus it seems like, with the parents, there's a ""been there, done that"" feeling for those of us who've watched the first Paranormal Activity movie (especially with the wife and how the evil lurking in the house takes over her mind and body).I'm not particularly fond of the setting- San Diego once AGAIN!  Let me share the same sentiments again (in case you haven't seen my review for the first Paranormal Activity that I submitted a couple weeks ago).  San Diego is the wrong location for a horror setting.  It's too mild there.  A much better place would be the northeast, especially anywhere from Massachusetts down to Georgia.Overall, expect a fantastic horror movie, but don't be surprised if it doesn't live up to your expectations, and definitely don't be surprised if it doesn't live up to the superior part one.",5,"awesome, but the first one is better",1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,4579,"['Paranormal', 'Activity',

1357246,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003Q6D25K,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 14]","If we don't find ourselves as scared as we did a year ago, it's because, this time around, we know exactly what to expect. There will be phantom thuds. There will be objects that move on their own. There will be doors that slam without the aid of a living person or a sudden gust of wind. In ""Paranormal Activity 2,"" many of these phenomena are preceded by the sound of a low-frequency rumble, which essentially gives audiences a signal to prepare themselves, reducing the fright factor even further. All we have left are unoriginal shock tactics like sudden loud noises, bursts of poltergeist activity, and near the end, the now overused Queasy Cam. Sitting in the theater, I was disappointed. After leaving, it all made perfect sense; the first film worked so well that there was absolutely nothing anyone could have done to top it.Having said that, it's a shame no one made more of an effort to keep it on equal terms. ""Paranormal Activity"" was a relentlessly frightening movie, largely because it didn't assault the audience with conventional pop out scares. It was slow and steady unfolding of disturbing subtleties, like a time-lapse shot of Katie Featherston standing over her sleeping boyfriend and staring at him for hours and hours. It made no real effort to explain the situation. I'd be hard pressed to say that there was even a plot - it was all just sort of ... happening. Not only does ""Paranormal Activity 2"" have a discernable plot, it also provides an explanation for just about everything. This time around, there was no need to have it consist entirely of footage from surveillance cameras and camcorders; it could have been filmed and released as a standard supernatural thriller, complete with special effects, music, and sets.With the exception of the final scene, the film is actually a prequel, taking place in the months prior to the events of ""Paranormal Activity."" The focus is Katie's sister, Kristi (Sprague Grayden), who lives in Carlsbad with her husband, Dan (Brian Boland), her infant son, Hunter (William and Jackson Prietro), her teenage stepdaughter, Ali (Molly Ephraim), and the family dog. One day, they come home and discover that the house has been ransacked, although nothing was actually taken; fearing for their safety, Dan has six security cameras installed all throughout the house. Thus begins ... well, I think you know very well what begins. Many of the first film's unsettling touches are recreated, only this time, they're repeated to the point of monotony. Consider, for example, the persistent use of swimming pool footage; almost every sequence taking place in the middle of the night begins with a shot of the pool. It's an obvious attempt to get us to notice the automated cleaner, which gets out of the water seemingly on its own.Would it surprise you to learn that both the dog and the toddler are more intuitive than anyone else in the house? If this long dead clich&eacute; doesn't bother you, then perhaps the Hispanic maid will. Never mind the fact that communication is possible in spite of the fact that she can only speak Spanish while her employers can only speak English; she's devoutly religious and seems to sense that something evil is in the house. At one point, she lights incense and walks through the kitchen while chanting something in low, terrified murmurs. Despite the best of intentions, she can't get anyone in the house to heed her warnings - and let me reiterate that she only speaks Spanish. The audience I sat with found this character funny for some reason. Have we come to the point where comedy relief in horror movies is defined solely by ethnicity?The ending is immensely unsatisfying. Partly, it's because of an unpleasant decision made by certain characters, one that made me dislike them. Mostly, however, it was because the story actually resolved itself, and did so quite unoriginally. Watching it unfold, I began thinking about the conclusion of the previous film, which, at the time, I found absolutely horrifying; had I known it would be the catalyst for this prequel, I would have lobbied for writer/director Oren Peli to reinsert one of his two alternate endings, which, by their descriptions alone, are indisputably frightening.When ""Paranormal Activity"" was first released, many agreed that it was one of the scariest films they had ever seen. I seriously doubt people will say the same thing about ""Paranormal Activity 2."" Oh, it will certainly make you jump at times, but the slow, consistent, creeping terror of the original film is nowhere to be found. Was there any way this movie could have been better, or at the very least, just as good? I admit that I was excited when I first saw the trailer, but in all likelihood, that was just a fanboy reaction. I understand now - the bar was set too high, meaning there was nowhere for it to go other than down.

If you didn't like the first film, I'm not sure why you would like this film, but conversely, if you enjoyed the original, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.  I don't think Paranormal Activity 2 (PA2) is as good as PA1.  I would give the first film five stars while this one only four simply because I don't think PA2 is as frightening as the first film.  The end of PA2 doesn't have the impact of PA1's ending.  There is one place in PA2 where you will probably jump, but it's a startle, not a scare.  A good one, though, nonetheless.  PA2 basically treads the same ground as PA1.  This makes it unoriginal, but it's also helps to make it an effective prequel/sequel.PA2 is both a prequel and short sequel to PA1.  PA2 starts well before the events of PA1 and ends shortly after PA1 ends.  Without giving away any spoilers, the majority of PA2 is the story of why the events in PA1 happened and then, for a few minutes at the end, PA2 shows how the events of PA1 impacted the characters in PA2.  All in all, for me, PA2 was an effective explanation and short continuation of the original film.The DVD includes two versions of the film, theactrical and unrated.

In the original, the couple had a reason - they were documenting what they believed to be a haunting.  This couple, however, is unaware of these problems.They do at least have the excuse of filming their toddler son growing up.  However, some video footage didn't tie into this or make any sense to film for that matter.For instance, it didn't make sense for a daughter to be repulsed that her dad is disposing of a dead bird but then film him doing that.  Who would break out the video cam to film that?  Or why would a husband film himself apologizing to his wife?  Or film himself going into a basement?I understand there had to be handheld cam shots or else the whole movie would be security video footage, which is hard on the eyes for long periods.  But even then, for the first half of the movie, nothing of interest is happening so it's pretty boring to watch.It isn't until midway through that things start to pick up and get more interesting.

Because this movie was following a similar format to the original, I pretty much knew what to expect.As far as acting goes, it was pretty good.  I liked the addition of the toddler boy and didn't.  I liked it because he was so adorable he made me laugh, but I didn't like it because I was concerned he might get hurt climbing a tall staircase unattended and getting pulled out of his crib.  I was also concerned the dog might've gotten hurt in one scene, too.What I did like about this movie is that it goes deeper into why these demonic possessions are happening to this family, which was interesting.  I also liked the scene where the girl is sleeping on the couch, too.

Events in the prequel are referenced and will make more sense after watching this one. On its own, Paranormal Activity 2 is good, but not great.Another stain on this decent film is that the family installs security cameras throughout their house, but only check the footage occasionally, therefore not validating their individual supernatural experiences. That's just dumb.The Ugly -- Comparisons between this and the first movie are bound to exist. While watching this one, I kept expecting scary things to happen because, after all, they did in the first one.

It's just the juxtaposition of middle class normalcy with a demonic haunting.  Everything is understated and the tension builds to a shattering conclusion.  I had to see PA 2 just to see if they were able to sustain the terror that the first movie had created.  I was not disappointed.  This is actually a prequel to the first movie as you find out at the very beginning.  The filming this time is mostly from home security cameras with a few bits from a hand held camcorder.  Things start slowly with just a few bumps being heard in the night.  The only person to notice anything is the Hispanic nanny who tries to warn the family and cleanse the house of evil spirits.  Of course, no one takes her seriously.  And things begin to get worse (who could have guessed?).  I don't want to give any more away but I will say that this is the first horror movie that I have ever seen which actually scared me so bad, it brought tears to my eyes.  If you have a weak bladder, you should probably wear your Depends.  I am not exaggerating when I say that the last 10-15 minutes of this movie could be dangerous to your health if you have a bad heart.  Of course, it probably didn't help that I went to a midafternoon matinee on the day after Halloween.  There were only 3 other people in the theater.  I had a whole row to myself in a dark and mostly empty theater - believe me, it's not the way you should watch this movie.  It's definitely a worthy successor to Paranormal Activity, in fact, I think it's scarier.  Kudos to the writer(s) and director of these movies.

If you're looking for a lot of shocking scenes or special effects, these films are not for you.I follow this series because of the long form story and the family situations. These movies capture what, to me, is a realistic view of what normal families would do if suddenly confronted by paranormal activity in their homes. That makes them more of a character study than a horror film series, even though there is an underlying supernatural arc. I find the acting very realistic and the actors chosen for these films engaging and likable. Unlike many reviewers, I prefer the low key intrusion of the entity to the usual overblown scenes that most horror films rely on. To me, it's more believable and therefore more unsettling.

Martine means well, but when Dan comes home and finds her with the burning sage, he orders her to stop. He does not want smoke and witchery in his house. He has told her before. He fires her and has her leave in the morning.With Martine now gone, the demonic spirit creates more havoc in the house.Also in the cast: Molly Ephraim as ""Ali"", Seth Ginsberg as ""Brad"", David Bierend as the surveillance camera expert.Paranormal Activity (2007) and Paranormal Activity 2 both work well online to watch on your computer.Nice house.

Gilligan ""Overeducated culture vulture""","[0, 0]","Definitely not a sequel in the conventional sense of the term and not quite a prequel either (since not all of the action in this film takes place before the action in ""Paranormal Activity""), ""Paranormal Activity 2"" is kind of a co-quel to the original. The story here focuses on Kristi and Daniel, a married couple who with a newborn baby, Hunter, and Daniel's daughter from another marriage, Ali. The link between this film and the first does not become apparent until Kristi's sister Katie and her husband Micah (the main characters from the first film) arrive for a visit. When Micah first appears, a graphic on the screen informs us that we are seeing him 60 days before his death--and the puzzle pieces begin coming together. Since there's a small child and a dog involved in this story, the terror potential is a bit higher than it was in the first film, but it seems to take an unbearably long time (and a seemingly infinite number of surveillance camera shots--of the same household scenes) before anything happens. The home video/documentary style narrative still works and affords us just enough information to co-construct the narrative, but this film delivers fewer spine-tingling and genuinely creepy moments than the original. When the action does happen, it is abrupt. And even though this film fills in some of the gaps in the original narrative by providing some additional information about the demonic power that's terrorizing Katie and Kristi and their families, it also ends with a scene that appends some information to the conclusion of the original and ultimately points the way to the third film in the series.

1357278,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B003Q6D25K,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 5]","While I'm a fan of the horror genre -- enjoying the collective works of George Romero, Takashi Miike, and Rob Zombie's House of a Thousand Corpses and The Devil's Rejects -- I have to say that I'm a bigger fan of that sub-genre known as the psychological thriller. 2009's Paranormal Activity was one of the best examples of this genre that I had seen in quite a while, as its not-quite-documentary quality/low budget look gave the scares in this film an air of reality not present in most modern horror movies. However, given Paramount's initial intentions with Paranormal Activity and the fact that the studio commissioned a sequel before the first movie's run in theaters was over, I have to say that I wasn't too excited at the prospect of seeing a sequel merely a year after the release of its predecessor.Paranormal Activity 2 takes place about two months before the beginning of Paranormal Activity. A year after bringing newborn son Hunter home, Kristi (sister of the first film's Katie) and family experience a break-in, prompting them to install security cameras all over the house. As increasingly bizarre events continue to occur around the house, Kristi's stepdaughter Ali grows curious about what's happening, while Kristi looks back to similar instances that occurred during her and Katie's childhood.In their attempts to profit from the success of the original film, Paramount created a sequel that is close in spirit to the first PA. The resulting film was made for $3 million and still features a completely unknown cast, with the exception of the original leads. Still relying largely on POV cameras, this films also features security camera footage, a brilliant way to feature what's going on in all areas of the house. Seeing exactly what's going on in an unoccupied room, or even outside the house, builds on the suspense the audience feels as we wonder what's going to happen when the family members find themselves in the same room as a spirit entity.Also adding to the eeriness of this film is the presence of innocent players. Watching Hunter, Kristi's one-year-old son, creates a feeling of dread in the audience as we constantly worry about if and when something is going to happen to him. Hunter's presence also creates a greater feeling of empathy toward the family as they struggle to keep him safe. Another innocent player in this thriller is the family's German Shepherd, Abby, who for most of the movie is merely trying to protect Hunter from a perceived threat, and is included in one of the movie's scarier moments. The family dynamic is also more developed in this sequel than in the original film, as there are more players, each with an individualized stance on what exactly is going on in the house.For a movie that was sped into production, the plotting and attention to detail in Paranormal Activity 2 are brilliant. This film acts as both a prequel and sequel, and when you see how the pieces fit together it feels perfectly logical without feeling forced. Fans of the first film will recognize a few references to the original Paranormal Activity that work to further the plot not only of this movie, but the original as well.  The care taken with this plot shows that Paramount and the writers/director chosen to further the PA franchise respected the source material.While the broad plot of Paranormal Activity 2 offers brilliance, some elements of the smaller plot points seem unrealistic and fail to further the plot on a lesser scale. While adding the security camera footage greatly enhances the film, the initial break-in that created a need for the cameras is somehow immediately forgotten by the characters. Logically speaking, it seems that the presence of security cameras would most likely result in a cautious optimism rather than this complete amnesia regarding the initial incident. Also, Ali's research into what's going on the house is presented too late and expounds on the events too quickly. These elements made me miss the more realistic approach of the first movie, in which the characters consult an actual demonologist about the spirit invading their home rather than the internet.I found myself spending more time acquainted with the edge of my seat in this film than I did the first. On at least one occasion I nearly threw my popcorn all over myself, and I've only jumped out of my seat for two other movies that I've seen in theaters. I highly recommend this film. If you're a fan of the original, interested in anything dealing with demonology, or love psychological thrillers, chances are you're going to love this movie!",4,Paranormal Activity 2,1290556800,"11 24, 2010",2010,4594,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'horror', 'genre', 'enjoying', 'collective', 'works', 'George', 'Romero', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'House', 'Thousand', 'Corpses', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'bigger', 'fan', 'sub-genre', 'known', 'psychological', 'thriller', '2009', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'genre', 'had', 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'not-quite-documentary', 'quality/low', 'budget', 'look', 'gave', 'scares', 'film', 'air', 'reality', 'not', 'present', 'most', 'modern', 'horror', 'movies', 'However', 'given', 'Paramount', 'initial', 'intentions', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'fact', 'studio', 'commissioned', 'sequel', 'first', 'movie', 'run', 'theaters', 'was', 'have', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'excited', 'prospect', 'seeing', 'sequel', 'merely', 'year', 'release', 'predecessor.Paranormal', 'Activity', '2', 'place', 'two', 'months', 'beginning', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'year', 'bringing', 'newborn', 'son', 'Hunter', 'home', 'Kristi', 'sister', 'first', 'film', 'Katie', 'family', 'experience', 'break-in', 'prompting', 'install', 'security', 'cameras', 'house', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'events', 'continue', 'occur', 'house', 'Kristi', 'stepdaughter', 'Ali', 'curious', 'what', 'happening', 'Kristi', 'back', 'similar', 'instances', 'occurred', 'Katie', 'childhood.In', 'attempts', 'profit', 'success', 'original', 'film', 'Paramount', 'created', 'sequel', 'close', 'spirit', 'first', 'PA', 'resulting', 'film', 'was', 'made', '3', 'million', 'still', 'completely', 'unknown', 'cast', 'exception', 'original', 'leads', 'Still', 'relying', 'largely', 'POV', 'cameras', 'films', 'also', 'security', 'camera', 'footage', 'brilliant', 'way', 'feature', 'what', 'going', 'areas', 'house', 'Seeing', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'unoccupied', 'room', 'even', 'house', 'suspense', 'audience', 'feels', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'when', 'family', 'members', 'find', 'same', 'room', 'spirit', 'entity.Also', 'adding', 'eeriness', 'film', 'presence', 'innocent', 'players', 'Watching', 'Hunter', 'Kristi', 'one-year-old', 'son', 'feeling', 'dread', 'audience', 'constantly', 'worry', 'when', 'something', 'going', 'happen', 'Hunter', 'presence', 'also', 'greater', 'feeling', 'empathy', 'family', 'struggle', 'keep', 'safe', 'innocent', 'player', 'thriller', 'family', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'Abby', 'who', 'most', 'movie', 'merely', 'trying', 'protect', 'Hunter', 'perceived', 'threat', 'included', 'one', 'movie', 'scarier', 'moments', 'family', 'dynamic', 'also', 'more', 'developed', 'sequel', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'players', 'individualized', 'stance', 'what', 'exactly', 'going', 'house.For', 'movie', 'was', 'sped', 'production', 'plotting', 'attention', 'detail', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '2', 'are', 'brilliant', 'film', 'prequel', 'sequel', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'pieces', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'logical', 'feeling', 'forced', 'Fans', 'first', 'film', 'will', 'recognize', 'few', 'references', 'original', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'work', 'further', 'plot', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'original', 'well', 'care', 'taken', 'plot', 'Paramount', 'writers/director', 'chosen', 'further', 'PA', 'franchise', 'respected', 'source', 'broad', 'plot', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '2', 'offers', 'brilliance', 'elements', 'smaller', 'plot', 'points', 'seem', 'unrealistic', 'fail', 'further', 'plot', 'lesser', 'scale', 'adding', 'security', 'camera', 'footage', 'greatly', 'film', 'initial', 'break-in', 'created', 'need', 'cameras', 'somehow', 'immediately', 'forgotten', 'characters', 'Logically', 'speaking', 'presence', 'security', 'cameras', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'result', 'cautious', 'optimism', 'rather', 'complete', 'amnesia', 'regarding', 'initial', 'incident', 'Also', 'Ali', 'research', 'what', 'going', 'house', 'presented', 'too', 'late', 'events', 'too', 'quickly', 'elements', 'made', 'miss', 'more', 'realistic', 'approach', 'first', 'movie', 'characters', 'consult', 'actual', 'demonologist', 'spirit', 'invading', 'home', 'rather', 'internet.I', 'found', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'acquainted', 'edge', 'seat', 'film', 'did', 'first', 'least', 'one', 'occasion', 'nearly', 'threw', 'popcorn', ""'ve"", 'only', 'jumped', 'seat', 'two', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'theaters', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', ""'re"", 'fan', 'original', 'interested', 'anything', 'dealing', 'demonology', 'love', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'movie']",N/A

1357281,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B003Q6D25K,Jean-ren Leroux,"[1, 4]","You don't need to have studied cinema in order to know that this sequel will not work. I've watched it cause curioisity got the best of me and i still wanted to give the creators a chance. What if this sequel (or prequel) was original?But no. I was scared right out of my mind with the first opus. In a fun kind of way, of course. But this second part didn't scare me at all. No trouble sleeping here. here's why, i think:A sequel usually means ""bigger"", ""badder"" and ""More"". If the ghosts take time to reveal themselves in the first part, well they need to show themselves sooner in the sequel. Everything needs to be sooner and bigger. You can't recreate the same exact pattern or else, what is the point? The problem with ""Paranormal Activity 2"" is that the first film was good BECAUSE it took its time to reveal its scary ""stuff"". Whereas the first one dealt with events that ""could"" happen (except the conclusion, of course), this one is going for the big scare right in the middle with incredible things that took me out of it by saying: ""C'mon!"". Yes, the first one had also certain phenomenons that seemed a bit exagerated but they came more toward the end. You were already scared-stiff when they happened.Plus, in this sequel, you have your normal clich&eacute;s (the non-english speaking maid that knows what's going on, the strong father that will not believe, etc) and you also have your incomprehensible reactions which make you go: ""Why, oh why?"".Warning: Spolier ahead.For example, why wouldn't the wife tell her husband what happened in the kitchen? She's been looking for ways to convince him and now that she has the best proof, she shuts down. And she's not possessed yet. Why would the daughter and the father stay in the house, sleep in it and let the baby alone in its craddle when they now know (and seen on the cameras) the incredible and menacing actions of the presence, especially toward the baby? I mean, the father even battled with the ghost or the demon and he even had to get his baby out of the pitch-black basement! But what do you know? They all sleep tight like nothing happened. With the baby in the craddle! You kind of wish that they die at that point for being so stupid.The fact that they wanted to make it a prequel and the fact that you see the protagonists of the first movie is kind of fun but again, the reason that the new protagonists give to each other in order to not warn the original couples is lame. It feels like a cheap and easy way to tie the two movies together. Like if the screenplay writers went with the easiest reason.Anyhow, in my humble opinion, the first one is a classic. Buy this one instead. It's up there along with ""The Blair Witch Project"".

1357282,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B003Q6D25K,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[1, 2]","The demons are back in this frightening sequel/prequel to the highly successful original.  ""Paranormal Activity 2"" focuses on Dan (Brian Boland), his wife Kristi (Sprague Grayden), Dan's daughter Ali, and newborn son Hunter.  Kristi's sister Katie was in the original film, and she and her boyfriend Micah appear in part 2 as well.  Their inclusion in this movie serves as a bridge to the events taking place in part 1.Almost immediately, the supernatural forces converge on young Hunter.  The loyal family dog can sense that something's wrong, as he spends most of his time guarding Hunter's crib. Things begin innocently enough; a few pans falling down, doors being opened, and the pool cleaner climbing out of the pool.  But, as the movie goes along, things get progressively worse.  Soon, Hunter is being held in the air by an unseen force, and Kristi is literally dragged from Hunter's room.  Despite these happenings, Dan is reluctant to admit that anything is wrong.  He even refuses to view footage recorded from his high-priced security system.  Daughter Ali has begun researching ghosts and spirits online with a friend in hopes of finding out about what is going on.The ending is truly scary and ties things together between parts 1 and 2 very nicely.  It sure looks like a ""Paranormal Activity 3"" is in the offing.I've enjoyed both ""Paranormal Activity"" films.  These films rely on psychological terror to scare the viewer, and they succeed very well.  There is a definite terror build-up as the movie goes along, and each time a video camera sequence appears, one can be sure that something scary is going to happen.  I thought part 2 started out a little slow, but as it went along, it definitely gets much scarier.I recommend ""Paranormal Activity 2"" to any fans of psychological terror.

1357284,A1EARN5PUVIF1S,B003Q6D25K,Jerry P. Danzig,"[2, 3]","I saw PA2 in the theater and was surprised how good it was -- an uncommonly effective sequel/prequel to the first PA film, which was a surprise in itself.What sets both films apart from so many so-called horror films today is the old-school less-is-more approach, perhaps necessitated on the first film by the shoe-string budget.Sound effects count for as much as visual effects, and there is barely a drop of blood to be seen anywhere.Instead, both films build suspense and terror the old-fashioned way -- slowly.  If you go back and watch the great horror films in cinema, you will see how carefully the terror is modulated.  The first big scares in ""Alien"" or ""Psycho,"" to name just two classics, don't appear until at least thirty minutes into the film.At that point, you're fully invested in the characters and the situation and wondering what will come next.The two PA films also rely on the static video cameras monitoring much of the paranormal activity.  This technique forces viewers to pay close attention to the screen, to see the scares, which start small and gradually ramp up.  When you hear a low-frequency rumble on the soundtrack, it's demon time... Stop shoveling popcorn in your mouth and pay closer attention!I have deducted a star for the lack of extras on the DVD.  There is an extended version of the film -- which I watched, but couldn't distinguish from the version I saw in the theater.  There are also a few extra ""found scenes"", one of which is genuinely scary and worth seeing.  But there is no director's commentary or making-of featurette, the absence of which I will ascribe more to studio greed than an adherence to the ""found footage"" illusion of this film and its predecessor.  (And that illusion is blown any way as soon as the lengthy technical credits roll at the end of the second film, shot on a larger budget.)So if you like suspenseful old-school horror films -- not the sadistic blood baths so common today -- see the first Paranormal Activity film and then the second.

Well, they did, and in spades.  Director Tod Williams did not cheese or FX this one up even a little bit: it elaborates on the story between Katie (Katie Featherston reprising her role for bits and parts) and her sister Kristi Rey (who does look somewhat like Featherston.)  At the opening of the film we see Dan, Kristi's husband, and their newborn baby Hunter.To say that this is one dysfunctional family would be an understatement.  Dr. Phil or Jerry Springer would not have a chance in hell (no pun intended) helping out in this one.  Without spoiling the film for others, the basic premise as discovered by Ali (Dan's teenage daughter from a previous marriage) is as follows: someone in the family line made a bargain with a demon of some kind, the catch being that the first-born child of the family decades later would have to be sacrificed. If one looks closely, particularly when the young Hunter is in bed sleeping, one can see some nasty ""subliminal images"" hovering all over the place, which only makes the real scares (which really only occur about half an hour into the movie) all that much jolting. In the first film a parapsychologist from San Francisco showed up periodically, not providing them with too much help. The significant difference  between ""PA"" and ""PA2"" is that here there is a chance for actual assistance: Martine, the family's housekeeper/nanny, a sweet aging immigrant who knows there is something direly wrong the estate and acts on that intuition.I am not foreign to horror films, and this is one scary, riveting, and at times humorous horror movie.

This was made for people who liked the original.  The people involved in making this flick saw no need to modify that which a lot of folks already liked.  So here we go...In any movie where we, the audience, will watch a group of people under emotional duress it is the screenwriter and director's job to have us identify with them somehow; humanize them.  So let's meet the players.  This family has QUITE a house (much like the pleasantly affluent couple in Paranormal Activity).  The man of the house has not one but two--TWO--man caves!!!!  The first-born daughter is a hand full.  I was looking forward to the lines that would pour out of that sassy mouth.  How does such a child get raised?  Well, that double-man-caving husband coupled with a wife who clearly never plans on doing a diaper.  And why bother?  She has a Latin nanny to whom she may delegate at will.  The nanny tends to the baby, their infant son, who dad thinks will favor father-son Chargers games over video games as he enters adolescence.  Good luck with that bonding, dad!  Relating with this American portrait yet?This family is living the American dream.  A McMansion of a house, a nanny, an adorable baby, sunny California BBQ's by the pool, and a dog that doesn't seem to bark, bite, drool or hump anything.  I don't want it to end.  The father even quotes Highlander while dunking his nephew in the pool.  ""There can be only ONE!""  Perfect.  A little too perfect?BAM!  The house is dilapidated!  It looks like they owed a hurricane money and it took it out on their interior decorating.  Without being any less intriguing for it, we find ourselves playing the exact same game as I did during the first Paranormal Activity.  We listen for strange noises.  We focus our eyes on random objects trying to convince ourselves whether or not they're moving ever so slightly.  When the dog stirs, stares or barks, we try to see what the dog is focusing on.  We get involved and otherwise meaningless security-cam footage of an uneventful house becomes a suspenseful ocular-sleuthing marathon.  Kudos to the filmmakers for taking me on this journey.  The movie develops from that point on and, well, you should know the kinds of things that follow.Completely off-topic, but the Latin maid speaks very little English, however she talks quite a bit.  No subtitles are offered to the audience when she speaks Spanish (to herself, in panic, in prayer, etc.).  But if you understand what she's saying, the movie is actually even more interesting.  Even more interesting than if they gave subtitles...because you know that you caught something that wasn't meant for everyone in the audience.  As I found myself understanding it I stopped to wonder how monolingual Americans would react to these indecipherable mutterings--would the mood be different?  No subtitles was a brilliant call.  Also, adding not only a dog OR a baby, but both, was a great call.  You'll find that you watch the baby much in the same way that you watch the dog.  They're both like windchime-harbingers of strange goings-on.I really enjoyed watching this movie.  There were times when I was watching the screen SOOOO carefully with my eyes darting about at details like a devout Ghost Hunter.  This movie was admittedly very similar to the prequel, but it was not a blatant repetition.  This sequel, unlike the original, also had a distinct protagonist: the daughter.",5,"Lots of tension, staring, ocular-sleuthing, listening and concentrating.

Soon it becomes apparent that this ""thing"" is some kind of demon that wants someone in the house and Kristi and the baby Hunter seem to be the targets.What separates this from the original is some more jolts but also shows what happened during the events from the first film, also forgot to mention Kristi is Katie's sister (the girl from the first movie) so it does explain more about the hauntings and why these sisters seem to be the focus. The demon seems far more aggressive in this one and really makes its presence known on more than a few occasions. I did love the kitchen scene where Kristi is sitting in the kitchen and suddenly all the cabinet doors and drawers open at once and the conclusion was truly scary to me.I did like the tie-ins between the first film and this as the events take place around roughly the same time frame. It does allow for some good scares and tension, even if the acting isn't all that great, director Tod Williams does keep the scares coming and keeps the story flowing. Another thing I enjoyed was Ali who really is a pretty girl and did keep me focused on the film. While its of course either loved or loathed I fall into the first category as this chilled me a good amount especially the conclusion. *** out of 4 stars.",4,More jolts than the original....,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,1688,"['newborn', 'baby', 'Daniel', 'Brian', 'Poland', 'Kristi', 'Sprague', 'Grayden', 'very', 'happy', 'bring', 'home', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Ali', 'Molly', 'Ephraim', 'thrilled', 'having', 'new', 'addition', 'family', 'Things', 'seem', 'very', 'good', 'course', 'thing', 'house', 'stuff', 'troubling', 'family', 'so', 'Daniel', 'cameras', 'installed', 'make', 'everyone', 'feel', 'safe', 'capture', 'anything', 'else', 'Soon', 'apparent', 'thing', 'kind', 'demon', 'someone', 'house', 'Kristi', 'baby', 'Hunter', 'seem', 'be', 'targets.What', 'original', 'more', 'jolts', 'also', 'what', 'happened', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'also', 'forgot', 'mention', 'Kristi', 'Katie', 'sister', 'girl', 'first', 'movie', 'explain', 'more', 'hauntings', 'why', 'sisters', 'seem', 'be', 'focus', 'demon', 'far', 'more', 'aggressive', 'one', 'really', 'presence', 'known', 'more', 'few', 'occasions', 'did', 'love', 'kitchen', 'scene', 'where', 'Kristi', 'sitting', 'kitchen', 'suddenly', 'cabinet', 'doors', 'drawers', 'open', 'once', 'conclusion', 'was', 'truly', 'scary', 'me.I', 'did', 'tie-ins', 'first', 'film', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'around', 'roughly', 'same', 'time', 'frame', 'allow', 'good', 'scares', 'tension', 'even', 'acting', ""n't"", 'great', 'director', 'Tod', 'Williams', 'keep', 'scares', 'coming', 'story', 'flowing', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'Ali', 'who', 'really', 'pretty', 'girl', 'did', 'keep', 'focused', 'film', 'course', 'loved', 'loathed', 'fall', 'first', 'category', 'chilled', 'good', 'amount', 'especially', 'conclusion', '***', '4', 'stars']",N/A

And the director, probably due to budget constraints, kept the story squarely on the couple and their little problem. The way PA 2 ties into the first film is quite clever, to have it run as a precursor and then concurrently to PA. But it just doesn't have a true feeling of suspense that the first one did. One goes from a feeling of ""ooh, what's gonna happen???"" to ""sheesh, I hope something happens."" The scares are so very s...l...o...w in coming and far too scarce. And at times, the activity is getting filmed but I can't figure out how or why. The cameras in the home were physically installed but these scenes are being filmed by someone else of two moving, mobile characters fully within the shots? Who is holding the camera? The demon? Mighty nice of it. And one other thing I have to quibble on is the Hispanic maid. She's convinced there are evil spirits in the home. This is such a stereotype that comedian George Lopez makes jokes how all Hispanics think they have at least one haunted room in their home. I can vouch that this is true because I'm married to a Hispanic and he's always thought that of each apt and home we've owned as have all his family members of their homes. Sorry if I offend anyone. My point -- it's no big deal or shocker if your Latino says there's a coo couie -yeah , laugh, I don't know the spelling or fantasma (ghost) in the home.

In short, PA2 is just like PA1. If you saw it, (Which you should before moving on to this one), you'll know exactly what you're in for. It's more of the same, for the most part. It takes what worked about PA1 and used it again, with a couple more interesting twists, and scraps most of what didn't work (long scenes with little or no payoff.) It's slightly scarier than the first one...the bigger budget led to more bangs and things flying at the camera that will make you jump, but the psychological aspect of the first one isn't present as much as it was before. In this way, its scary while you're at the movie, but you shouldn't have issues sleeping. This movie's a worthy follow up to the first- it learned from its mistakes from the first film, and its a pretty good horror flick. An added bonus if more look into the series mythology and more clarification about WHY the events of the first film happened. I won't spoil it, it's pretty good though.

It is more along the lines of a prequel/parallel story.  You are introduced to a new family about to be terrorized by a demonic force.This family is related to Katie from the first movie in that Katie and the wife, Kristi, are sisters.You learn more of the back-story of these sisters in that they conducted seances and dabbled in the occult when they were younger. You also learn, by way of step-daughter Ali, that their grandmother probably made some kind of deal with the demon and it is after Kristi's son, Hunter.After the home is ransacked, they install security cameras all over the house. Every single time ""something"" happens you are witness to the same progression over-and-over. Outside, pool, inside kitchen, inside living room, front door, Hunter's room.Every. Single. Time.This is part of what makes this sequel intolerable and boring.The beauty of the first film was that each night, you knew something was going to happen and it kept getting worse. It built a level of tension that you could cut with a butter knife. In this one, there is too much boring video of people walking around and that stupid pool cleaner.There is only one redeemable moment in the film: when Ali is sleeping on the couch and you see a shadow creep closer to her and when it nears, she jerks awake.

1357305,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B003Q6D25K,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","When Paranormal Activity came out I didn't buy the hype.  But when I finally did see it in theaters, it really did spook me.  What's surprising is how little ""gotcha"" moments there are in the film - the horror is in the viewer's head, the dread rising to unbearable levels as we wait for the screaming release.Paranormal Activity 2 (PA2) takes this bait-and-hook filmmaking style to a new level. Kristi (Sprague Grayden) and Dan Rey (Brian Boland) live in a posh California home, complete with stepdaughter Ali (Molly Ephraim), Abby the German Shepherd, and adorable son Hunter.  After a paranormal entity trashes the house the movie shifts to security footage of the interior and the exterior of the house. But it's what the cameras don't show that nags at you: a dog barking at something off camera, a child staring upwards at the ceiling, an open basement door.No PA film would be complete without the unbelieving idiot, and Dan takes the role of Micah from the first film.  When housekeeper and nanny Martine (Vivis Cortez) tries to cleanse the house of evil by ""smudging,"" Dan fires her.  It's only later that we realize this film takes place in the same universe as the first, when Kristi's doomed sister Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) appear in the film.Then your brain really begins to spin.  Since the events in the second film take place before the first, why are there no references to what happened in PA? Why are Kristi and Katie experiencing similar hauntings? And what the heck does the entity want with Hunter?Like the first film, Paranormal Activity revels in the things we fear most.  The horror is in the darkest part of the house (the attic in the first film, the basement in the second).  PA2 revolves around Hunter, the first boy born in generations to the family, which becomes a major plot point.  If this was just another haunting like the first installment, PA2 would be rather mundane, but fortunately it's much more than that - it is both a prequel and a sequel to the original, adding more material to the mythology that started the series.Character-wise, this film is weaker than the first .The father is irritatingly stubborn about his family's circumstances, and at times different characters disappear for stretches of time without explanation - Ali gets locked out of the house for over a half hour while the baby is inside sleeping but neither calls the police nor breaks a window; the housekeeper exits, enters, and mysteriously exits the plot; and Dan's sudden conversion to the supernatural beggars belief.  PA2's backstory detracts somewhat from the horror of the first movie, because it gives the paranormal a more coherent motivation. But then, this wouldn't be much of a franchise if it had nothing in common with the first installment.PA2 is most frightening for new parents.  Knowing that a child is at risk heightens parents' anxiety, literally demonizing our fear of child abductions.  But if you really want to be frightened, watch this film at home at night during a storm.  When the cable went out and our house alarm went off...let's just say it added to the suspense. We weren't able to finish watching the last fifteen minutes of the film until Halloween.",4,Scary for parents,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,3226,"['When', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'came', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'hype', 'when', 'finally', 'did', 'see', 'theaters', 'really', 'did', 'spook', 'What', 'surprising', 'how', 'little', 'gotcha', 'moments', 'are', 'film', 'horror', 'viewer', 'head', 'dread', 'rising', 'unbearable', 'levels', 'wait', 'screaming', 'release.Paranormal', 'Activity', '2', 'PA2', 'bait-and-hook', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'new', 'level', 'Kristi', 'Sprague', 'Grayden', 'Dan', 'Rey', 'Brian', 'Boland', 'live', 'posh', 'California', 'home', 'complete', 'stepdaughter', 'Ali', 'Molly', 'Ephraim', 'Abby', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'adorable', 'son', 'Hunter', 'paranormal', 'entity', 'house', 'movie', 'shifts', 'security', 'footage', 'interior', 'exterior', 'house', 'what', 'cameras', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'nags', 'dog', 'barking', 'something', 'camera', 'child', 'staring', 'upwards', 'ceiling', 'open', 'basement', 'door.No', 'PA', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'unbelieving', 'idiot', 'Dan', 'role', 'Micah', 'first', 'film', 'When', 'housekeeper', 'nanny', 'Martine', 'Vivis', 'Cortez', 'cleanse', 'house', 'evil', 'smudging', 'Dan', 'only', 'later', 'realize', 'film', 'place', 'same', 'universe', 'first', 'when', 'Kristi', 'doomed', 'sister', 'Katie', 'Katie', 'Featherston', 'Micah', 'Micah', 'Sloat', 'appear', 'film.Then', 'brain', 'really', 'spin', 'events', 'second', 'film', 'take', 'place', 'first', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'no', 'references', 'what', 'happened', 'PA', 'Why', 'are', 'Kristi', 'Katie', 'experiencing', 'similar', 'hauntings', 'what', 'heck', 'entity', 'want', 'Hunter', 'first', 'film', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'revels', 'things', 'fear', 'most', 'horror', 'darkest', 'part', 'house', 'attic', 'first', 'film', 'basement', 'second', 'PA2', 'around', 'Hunter', 'first', 'boy', 'born', 'generations', 'family', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'was', 'just', 'haunting', 'first', 'installment', 'PA2', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'mundane', 'fortunately', 'much', 'more', 'prequel', 'sequel', 'original', 'adding', 'more', 'material', 'mythology', 'started', 'series.Character-wise', 'film', 'weaker', 'first', '.The', 'father', 'irritatingly', 'stubborn', 'family', 'circumstances', 'times', 'different', 'characters', 'disappear', 'stretches', 'time', 'explanation', 'Ali', 'locked', 'house', 'half', 'hour', 'baby', 'inside', 'sleeping', 'police', 'window', 'housekeeper', 'enters', 'mysteriously', 'plot', 'Dan', 'sudden', 'conversion', 'supernatural', 'beggars', 'belief', 'PA2', 'backstory', 'somewhat', 'horror', 'first', 'movie', 'paranormal', 'more', 'coherent', 'motivation', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'franchise', 'had', 'nothing', 'common', 'first', 'installment.PA2', 'most', 'frightening', 'new', 'parents', 'Knowing', 'child', 'risk', 'heightens', 'parents', 'anxiety', 'literally', 'demonizing', 'fear', 'child', 'abductions', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'frightened', 'watch', 'film', 'home', 'night', 'storm', 'When', 'cable', 'went', 'out', 'house', 'alarm', 'went', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'added', 'suspense', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'finish', 'watching', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'Halloween']",N/A

1357307,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B003Q6D25K,Monkdude,"[3, 8]","Well, I planned on waiting for the DVD release of Paranormal Activity 2, but I read some reviews saying that it was better than the original. I liked the simplicity and slow building nature of the scares in the surprisingly high grossing debut, so I didn't know if this sequel would feel too much like a been there, done that. The answer is yes, but this is the rare second film that improves upon many of the weaknesses of the first. We now get multiple camera set-ups thanks to a pimped out security system, along with a few more characters that don't tend to get on your nerves quite as much as the two leads in the original. I didn't know that this was a prequel going in, so I was a little surprised when Katie and Micah showed up. Turns out, her sister's family was the where the demonic haunting originated. I really liked how they connected the two movies.If you hated Paranormal Activity, stay far away from this one. It has the same slow pacing and often annoying camera work, though much more controlled this time around. A few of the jump scares got my attention, but it also never loses the subtle creepiness that builds with each passing day spent with this family. Sure it's not anything new or a huge upgrade, but in this day and age of horror remakes and horror franchises that don't know when to die (I'm looking at you SAW ""I'm too embarrassed to call it SAW VII"" 3D), at least they have come up with a fresh formula that has gotten back to the basics.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",4,"""I Ain't Afraid of No Ghost""",1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,1495,"['Well', 'planned', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'release', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '2', 'read', 'reviews', 'saying', 'was', 'better', 'original', 'liked', 'simplicity', 'slow', 'building', 'nature', 'scares', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'grossing', 'debut', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'sequel', 'would', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'answer', 'yes', 'rare', 'second', 'film', 'many', 'weaknesses', 'first', 'now', 'get', 'multiple', 'camera', 'set-ups', 'thanks', 'pimped', 'out', 'security', 'system', 'few', 'more', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'tend', 'get', 'nerves', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'two', 'leads', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'prequel', 'going', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'when', 'Katie', 'Micah', 'showed', 'up', 'out', 'sister', 'family', 'was', 'where', 'demonic', 'haunting', 'originated', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'connected', 'two', 'movies.If', 'hated', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'one', 'same', 'slow', 'pacing', 'often', 'annoying', 'camera', 'work', 'though', 'much', 'more', 'controlled', 'time', 'around', 'few', 'jump', 'got', 'attention', 'also', 'never', 'subtle', 'creepiness', 'passing', 'day', 'spent', 'family', 'Sure', 'not', 'anything', 'new', 'huge', 'upgrade', 'day', 'age', 'horror', 'remakes', 'horror', 'franchises', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'die', ""'m"", 'looking', 'SAW', ""'m"", 'too', 'embarrassed', 'call', 'SAW', 'VII', '3D', 'least', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'fresh', 'formula', 'gotten', 'back', 'basics.3', '1/2', '5', 'stars']",N/A

It's better than the original in some ways, and in others- not as good. One thing I did like is the way the film took time to build the paranormal activity to the point that it escaladed slowly so that it was believable. But at the same time it took too long. It felt like eternity. Once the real scary stuff beings it get's a little bit cheesy for my taste. And frankely the end seemed kind of stupid. And there was some clear reminders of the Blair Witch project. This is the kind of film that should scare people that are effected by silly horror films like Scream, but for harcore horror fans this will keep your attention but it's not going to blow you away. Most of what works about this film is what you fear is going to happen. In reality if your imagination is runing wild, what you imagine is probably a hundred times better than what actually happens. But on the other hand I don't anyone would expect a sequal like this to be anything but a total flop, and the film is far from that territory.

So I knew I had to go see `Paranormal Activity 2', and this is my review on it.Synopsis: The Rey family has just moved into their new home. The family consists of Dan (the father), his wife Kristi (who is also the sister of Katie from movie 1), their baby boy Hunter, and Ali, Dan's teenage daughter from his first marriage. As soon as they move in, one day they notice the furniture in most of the rooms wrecked, except Hunter's room, but nothing is stolen as such. They assume it was probably a break-in, and install security cameras around the house to catch anyone trying to break in again.As the days pass, strange incidents that occurring in the house that no one can explain. Dan doesn't witness any of the paranormal activity as such, and therefore refuses to believe that there is something supernatural happening in the house. Kristi starts experiencing some activities, but Katie tells her not to react on it, or it would just get worse. The only person who really starts taking the activities seriously is Ali, because initially she thinks that her mother is trying to reach her, but after researching further, she figures out what the root cause of the paranormal activities are. Can the Rey family survive whatever's inhibiting the house before its too late?NOTE: My review below contains quite a few spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie and don't want to know what is going to happen, please skip ahead and read the last paragraph.Review: Although many people consider Paranormal Activity 2 to be one of those movies that you either love it or hate it, I actually had mixed feelings with this movie. While I liked it for the most part, I felt that there were some aspects to the story that made me slightly disappointed with it.What I liked: I loved how the story takes place in the timeline that coincides with the first movie, as this answered a lot of my questions as to what happens in the first movie as well. We get to see why Kristi starts experiencing the paranormal activities, and how this in turn affects Katie in the first movie as well. Most of the horror movies sequels that I have watched either take place before or after the first movie's timeline, so I really enjoyed how `Paranormal Activity 2' timeline stars off before the first movie and gradually catches up to it and goes beyond it.I also enjoyed the fact that the story was paced really well, and staying true to the first movie, we see the activities starting to occur gradually in the house. The cast also did a great job in their performances, and it was great to see Katie and Micah make appearances in this one as well. The house itself looked really lavish, and I also liked the idea viewing the occurrences through security cameras around the house.What disappointed me (spoiler alert): While the movie had some really terrifying moments to it (like the cupboards all opening at once), I think the major part of the story that ruined my experience was towards the end. I still don't want to give away the scene for those who didn't see the movie yet, but there is a scene where the entire family goes to the basement to basically get rid of the demon. While I can understand that this is one of the main parts that links this movie to its predecessor, it just seemed really unrealistic that Dan, who never believed in any of these things till moments before the end, could suddenly (with the help of Martine the maid) perform an exorcism so easily in around 10 minutes to get the demon transferred to another body. I'm sorry, but this seemed like a lame way to link the two movies together, and it felt that the writers got lazy towards the end and just came up with this idea in the last minute. I would have enjoyed the story better, if say they brought in the psychiatrist (from the first movie who comes to Katie's house regularly), or someone from the church etc. to remove the demon from Kristi. The main idea of the father doing this in the end, and his family still living in the same house after that, and not to mention that we never find out what happened to the maid after that incident etc. just seemed a little ludicrous to me.Also, because a lot of questions are answered in this movie as to why the paranormal presence is targeting the family (and also Katie's family), this movie didn't have that eerie effect on me like the first movie did, because the first movie had a lot of questions that were unanswered (like why the presence wouldn't let go of Katie), so it left a lot of theories open for interpretation, and I enjoyed this aspect about it. Whereas, in this movie, we find out why everything is happening, so there's no room for interpretation. We just get to see how the family tackles the demon, and while I enjoyed this, it didn't scare me in anyway or make me lose any sleep over it like how the first one did.Overall, I think if the explanations for the incidents in the story were explained in a better manner, I would have loved this movie, and even considered it better than the first movie. However, because of my problems with the scene mentioned above, `Paranormal Activity 2' still remains a good sequel, but not as good as the first movie.",4,"Good sequel, but not as good as its

1357326,A39W3263A9HCMN,B003Q6D25K,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[5, 11]","Last year, the horror phenomenon Paranormal Activity was released. The film was probably one of the most polarizing films of the year: Some thought it was scary as hell, others thought it was boring and like home videos. I, personally, side with the ""scary as hell"" side and loved it enough to file it under my ""Best Movies of 2009"" list. It reminded me of WHY we watch horror films: to feel fear and dread, to be scared and not watch people get killed in gory ways or having crap jump out at you. There were a few jumps but the film was tension fueled, which made it brilliant.Now a year later, and a sequel is released. And thankfully, it manages to be just as great, and maybe even more terrifying!!! I swear with these movies, the horror genre has some hope left. In a world of crap like My Soul To Take (I didn't want to waste a long amount of time ranting so I wrote a review of MSTT in poem format), jump fueled PG-13 horror and gore/torture porn, for once we're getting horror movies that are not only ACTUALLY scary, but follow the rule that Hitchcock set up when he was making movies: the scariest aspect is what we don't see.This film takes place 62 days before Micah Sloat died. A new family is the focus, and the mother, Kristy, is Katie's sister. They seem happy, as they have a beautiful daugher Ali, and a CUTE baby boy Hunter. The family has been experiencing a series of what could be called break-ins. We see ONE aftermath of them- and the house looks like a tornado blew through it- broken beer bottles, stuff broken, things scattered everywhere, etc. The family then resorts to hiring a surveillance team to install a series of cameras around the house, in case any suspicious activity happens.However, these clearly are no break-ins. Martin, the Spanish maid, has a spooky experience one night when a giant thump reverberates through the kitchen. Things get even spookier when Ali gets locked out of the house, and some even creepier stuff happens too, one involving the baby. And then, from there... things go from creepy to downright TERRIFYING. The same demon that haunted Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston is haunting them. But DOUBLE as scary, and to the point where you can't take the scariness anymore.I was worried this film would not live up to its predecessor, but thank God that worry proved useless. I loved it just as much as Paranormal Activity the first one. Sure the scares are recycled, but they did that for a reason- the same demon is haunting them. That means the household the demon haunted is off to do his tricks to the next household, which, if you ask me, makes it all the more scary to think about. Like the first, this one follows the Hitchock rule. But from the ""Kitchen"" scene, the terror level increases. the film thereon becomes disturbing as hell and just downright terrifying.Another thing I must praise is that this movie manages to bring a new element to the series- the feeling of being alone, and experiencing a terrifying moment not just at night but at all times of the day. The ""kitchen"" scene is a good example of this- in fact that scene alone made the movie more effective than the first. Ever had those moments where you have been alone in your home, and somehow knew you weren't alone? That an unseen presence is with you? That something can happen at any time? This movie focuses on that in the same fashion the first movie focused on what happens when you sleep.In short, Paranormal 2 is a success, and proof there is still hope for the horror genre. If you liked this one, give it a chance, and even if you didn't like the first, still give it your best shot. I certainly loved it as much as the first, and it also must be seen on the big screen- whereas the first worked better at home, this must be seen at the theatre with a packed crowd like I saw it tonight.

All the people who trolled the review sites with the first one trying to be creative with the dialogue to their empty insults no longer have a leg to stand on because they knew what to expect. It wasnt a sequel where you could say they ruined the first one, like Scream, it was a literal elaboration of the first movie. This one had just as much to offer as the first one, they just divided it up into different portions. The casual scenes were funnier and contained dialogue actually worth listening to which served as a misdirection to further dramatize the effectiveness of the scary scenes. They put more shock value on the individual scenes, then slowed the pace of the movie which ultimately led to a higher anxious anticipation of what was to come. Each explosive scene in the second completely outdid that of the first. And while in the back of your head you kinda knew how it was gonna end, it was just so messed up that you refused to believe it until you actually seen it. The ONLY reason the first had a chance at being scarier is because you werent familiar with the story yet. They put way more of an explanation to the story and somehow managed to do it without being cheesy. If you didnt like the first, then avoid this.

1357329,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B003Q6D25K,RMurray847,"[11, 19]","PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was flat-out one of the scarier movies of recent years.  The simple story, told with the low-budget device of all the events being captured on a home camcorder, was remarkably effective and the film gave a sensation of reality and was extremely creepy.  Most ""scary"" movies just go for giving you a jump-in-your-seat moment...if t hey can momentarily make your heart beat faster, that's success enough.  PARANORMAL actually made me feel a little bit anxious, even after the film was over.Inevitably, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 cannot be so successful, because it used many of the same conventions as the first.  The shock of newness has worn off.  That being said, it is a far, far better sequel than anyone had the right to hope for.We meet a family in Southern California on the day the couple comes back from the hospital with their new baby, Hunter.  Dad is a nearing middle-aged man with a teenage daughter, Ali, from a previous marriage.  His wife is considerably younger...but not to the point of being ridiculous.  They have a nice, older housekeeper and a German Shepherd.  They are a pretty happy group...the teen daughter is actually a nice, intelligent, helpful young lady.  There's no marital strife.  Life is good.One day, they experience a break-in, so Dad has a security system installed, with camera's focused on several spots of the house at once.  This device allows for several angles to be captured at one time...because their domestic bliss is soon interrupted by strange events.  This is how PA2 is a step forward from PA.  The first film relied exclusively on footage captured on one camcorder.  Now we have about 6 different shots of the house, along with camcorder footage.  It's a nifty (if obvious) device...but it's pretty important.  We can now watch mysterious things happening in more than one location at a time.  It becomes pretty clear early on that whatever paranormal activity is going on in this household is directed primarily at young Hunter.I do not want to give away any more plot, because there are actually some surprises in store.  And the first movie does have an unexpected connection to the sequel...a very clever and satisfying one, in my opinion.  In fact, I somewhat regret not watching the first one again prior to seeing the sequel.The movie retains, for the most part, the low-budget feel.  We're supposedly watching ""found"" footage again.  However, because several cameras were used, obviously significantly more editing was needed...therefore the movie feels just a little less ""found"" than before.  And the acting, frankly, is just a bit slicker than the first time.  This all results in a very low-budget movie that still feels ever so slightly glossy.  Probably not enough to detract from the overall experience...but I certainly noticed.The film, in my opinion, offers more creepiness and fewer genuine frights than the first.  It plays off our sense of dread very well.  For nearly 90 minutes, you sit there worried about what will happen next.  This doesn't really happen in horror films very often, and it is an uncomfortable yet pleasurable experience.I was very skeptical that PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 would be anything more than a cheap rip-off of the first...a pure cash grab.  I'm very happy to report that this is actually a highly-satisfying, unexpectedly clever sequel that tries, first and foremost, to creep you out.  If you liked or loved the first film, you'll enjoy this one as well.  If, for some reason, you disliked the first...stay away and let the rest of us enjoy!",4,"A surprisingly solid, and still creepy, sequel.",1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,3558,"['PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'was', 'flat-out', 'one', 'scarier', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'simple', 'story', 'told', 'low-budget', 'device', 'events', 'being', 'captured', 'home', 'camcorder', 'was', 'remarkably', 'effective', 'film', 'gave', 'sensation', 'reality', 'was', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'Most', 'scary', 'movies', 'just', 'go', 'giving', 'jump-in-your-seat', 'moment', 'hey', 'can', 'momentarily', 'make', 'heart', 'beat', 'faster', 'success', 'enough', 'PARANORMAL', 'actually', 'made', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'anxious', 'even', 'film', 'was', 'over.Inevitably', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', '2', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'successful', 'used', 'many', 'same', 'conventions', 'first', 'shock', 'newness', 'worn', 'off', 'being', 'said', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'sequel', 'anyone', 'had', 'right', 'hope', 'for.We', 'meet', 'family', 'Southern', 'California', 'day', 'couple', 'back', 'hospital', 'new', 'baby', 'Hunter', 'Dad', 'nearing', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Ali', 'previous', 'marriage', 'wife', 'considerably', 'younger', 'not', 'point', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'have', 'nice', 'older', 'housekeeper', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'are', 'pretty', 'happy', 'group', 'teen', 'daughter', 'actually', 'nice', 'intelligent', 'helpful', 'young', 'lady', 'marital', 'strife', 'Life', 'good.One', 'day', 'experience', 'break-in', 'so', 'Dad', 'security', 'system', 'installed', 'camera', 'focused', 'several', 'spots', 'house', 'once', 'device', 'several', 'angles', 'be', 'captured', 'one', 'time', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'soon', 'interrupted', 'strange', 'events', 'how', 'PA2', 'step', 'forward', 'PA', 'first', 'film', 'relied', 'exclusively', 'footage', 'captured', 'one', 'camcorder', 'Now', 'have', 'about', '6', 'different', 'shots', 'house', 'camcorder', 'footage', 'nifty', 'obvious', 'device', 'pretty', 'important', 'can', 'now', 'watch', 'mysterious', 'things', 'happening', 'more', 'one', 'location', 'time', 'pretty', 'clear', 'early', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'going', 'household', 'directed', 'primarily', 'young', 'Hunter.I', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'away', 'more', 'plot', 'are', 'actually', 'surprises', 'store', 'first', 'movie', 'have', 'unexpected', 'connection', 'sequel', 'very', 'clever', 'satisfying', 'one', 'opinion', 'fact', 'somewhat', 'regret', 'not', 'watching', 'first', 'one', 'again', 'prior', 'seeing', 'sequel.The', 'movie', 'retains', 'most', 'part', 'low-budget', 'feel', ""'re"", 'supposedly', 'watching', 'found', 'footage', 'again', 'However', 'several', 'cameras', 'were', 'used', 'obviously', 'significantly', 'more', 'editing', 'was', 'needed', 'therefore', 'movie', 'just', 'little', 'less', 'found', 'before', 'acting', 'frankly', 'just', 'bit', 'slicker', 'first', 'time', 'results', 'very', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'still', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'glossy', 'Probably', 'not', 'enough', 'detract', 'overall', 'experience', 'certainly', 'noticed.The', 'film', 'opinion', 'more', 'creepiness', 'fewer', 'genuine', 'frights', 'first', 'sense', 'dread', 'very', 'well', 'nearly', '90', 'minutes', 'sit', 'there', 'worried', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', ""n't"", 'really', 'happen', 'horror', 'films', 'very', 'often', 'uncomfortable', 'yet', 'pleasurable', 'experience.I', 'was', 'very', 'skeptical', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', '2', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'cheap', 'rip-off', 'first', 'pure', 'cash', 'grab', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'report', 'actually', 'highly-satisfying', 'unexpectedly', 'clever', 'sequel', 'first', 'foremost', 'creep', 'out', 'liked', 'loved', 'first', 'film', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'reason', 'disliked', 'first', 'stay', 'away', 'let', 'rest', 'enjoy']",N/A

1357331,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003Q6D25K,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 9]","Paranormal Activity 2 (Tod Williams, 2010)I started watching horror films in 1974, at the tender age of six, with The Exorcist. That one left with me with nothing but a raging crush on Linda Blair (that still burns thirty-six years later, by the by). And any other movie you can think of that got trumpeted ""scariest movie EVAR!"" by some critic or other pretty much left me the same way, either wanting to see it again because it's just awesome or wondering what all the fuss was about. In the intervening time, I've seen hundreds of horror movies. Maybe over a thousand. Of them, there have been four that, after the first seeing of them, I have absolutely refused to spend any time in a dark room. The first was Larry Hagman's 1972 Beware! The Blob, and in my defense, I was eight years old. (Can't remember completely, but I think it was the scene in the barbershop that traumatized me.) Second came Pet Sematary, my junior year in college (the sister did it, absolutely). The third was Candyman (it's the sound mix in the first meeting between Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd, which means if you haven't seen it on the big screen, you've no idea what I'm talking about). And the fourth, and I can't tell you what did it without insane amounts of spoilers, was Paranormal Activity 2.The worst part is, it's not all that good a movie, really. If we learned one thing from the original Paranormal Activity, a movie I was very impressed with, it's that Oren Peli is a master of blocking shots. If we learn one thing from Paranormal Activity 2, it's that Tod Williams (The Adventures of Sebastian Cole) does one hell of an Oren Peli impersonation. But every time he tries to revise and extend the convention of the original (and to be fair, he only does that once), he turns to the language of another film. (Or, to put that in not so kind a tone, the climax here is a complete rip-off of the climax of Jaume Balaguero's superior [REC].) I walked out of the theater thinking ""meh"" and figuring I'd give it three stars for being watchable and having a few really good jumps, but not being anything at all original. And then I got in the car and started home, and the impact of the movie started to creep in, and by the time I'd finished the seven- or eight-minute drive, I was gibbering and cowering in the corner and crying for my mommy like a schoolgirl. And that has not a blessed thing to do with Tod Williams, or almost anyone else involved in this picture; it has to do with a guy whose name you probably don't know, Michael Perry. But more on that in a minute.Plot: this is a prequel of sorts to the original Paranormal Activity, which allowed the team to bring back Katie and Micah, the beautiful couple from the first film. (Yes, guys, Katie Featherston is still that hot.) They are marginal characters, however. The film actually centers around Katie's sister Kristi (I should've jotted down names, because IMDB isn't listing anyone but Katie Featherston as I write this), her husband Dan, Kristi's stepdaughter Ali, and Dan and Kristi's son Hunter, who begins the film as a newborn, but is about a year old when the bulk of the action takes place. If you've seen the original, you know exactly how this is going to block out; you're going to be bored off your skull for the first half of the film with home movies. (To be fair, Williams does start the minor things happening pretty quick, but nothing that will make you jump until much later.) At one point, they come home and find the house trashed, so they have a security company come in and put up hidden cameras in the house. You know what's coming from there; you've seen the original, and Williams does nothing until the last ten minutes of the film to differentiate it from its older brother.Those last ten minutes are all down to Michael Perry, who's written for such disparate, but excellent, TV shows as House, Millennium, and FreakyLinks. He does just about everything that makes me hate a sequel if I know it coming in, but he somehow manages to do it all correctly. First and most importantly, he took a two-person film (and anyone who knows me will tell you I'm a sucker for a two-person film) and made it into a family gig. I figured that was strike one before I even walked into the theater, but I have a friend who has both a German Shepherd and a toddler who steadfastly refuses to see this movie because it contains a German Shepherd and a toddler. I admit, I was one of those poking fun at her, since she's as much a horror fan as I am. But Perry knows how to mash your buttons like a caffeinated twelve-year-old playing Super Mario World, and I totally get it now, even though I have never owned a German Shepherd and haven't had a toddler in well over a decade. You add a kid and you add an animal and while you're taking the easy road to scaring the bejesus out of your audience, you're taking the effective road.Second, there's the whole ""there was no explanation for the bad stuff in the first movie"" syndrome. Scary things are scarier, in general, when you have no freakin' clue why they're even happening. As a side note, it also avoids those messy plot holes. (Combine those two things and that's what makes Ils such a better movie than Haute Tension, for example.) I figured it was inevitable that Perry would do the ""let's explain the events of both movies here!"" thing, and so I wasn't surprised when he did. And it's not even all that original an explanation, but it's simple, it's effective, and it does explain both movies perfectly... especially when you get to those last ten minutes.Which brings me to point #3. It depends on which version of the original film you saw (I have seen two, and have been told at least one more exists) and how you interpreted the events in the final scene if you saw the correct (read: original) ending. If you thought you were seeing what I thought I was seeing (most of the action took place off-camera, as you'll recall), then I can't figure out a way that the last ten minutes of this movie don't break canon. I've been trying to make it work in my head ever since I saw the movie. I'll have to go back and re-watch the end of the first one tonight to see if I missed something, but as far as I can tell, there's a canon fracture here... and I didn't care, which astounds me more than anything else about this movie. It didn't. matter. one. bit. It's cheap and it's loose and it's so obviously tacked on for convenience's sake (like a number of other pieces of the script) and it doesn't matter because it's like getting hit smack in the forehead with a piledriver. And yes, when you're sitting in a brightly-lit cafe with your pals, you will deconstruct this ending and you will, rightly, tear it to shreds, as you will for most of the movie. But the fact that it's not well-conceived does not in any way mean it is not well-executed. While trying not to give anything away, I will risk a possible slight spoiler and say that the entire reason this ending works is the ambiguity of it. It's obvious that Perry knows exactly what he's doing by making this ending ambiguous. I think had he shown what happens in the conclusion to which you are obviously being led, it wouldn't have had nearly the effect that it did. Instead, he just lets it hang there and lets your imagination do the work. That's some sort of demented genius, though I'm not sure what yet.While unsuccessfully searching for cast information for this flick (and Katie Featherston fetishists take note that the actress who plays Kristi really could be her sister, just shorter hair and a bit perkier of a personality), I stumbled across a story where Peli is interviewed, along with Featherston and Sloat. In it, Sloat comments, ""When you can't really see what's going on, your imagination starts to run wild. And the truth is that anything you can imagine is going to be better than anything you can actually see."" That's it, exactly, it's why this works (and where it stumbles in certain places when Williams crosses the line between ""showing just enough"" and ""maybe showing just a little bit too much and giving the game away""). Peli says ""It taps into people's primal fears of what happens at night and while you're asleep and most vulnerable."" And I have yet to see if my second night post-Paranormal Activity 2 will let me shut off a light.I have no idea how to rate this film. It's derivative, it's not especially well-made, it takes no risks, and the downside of putting more than two actors in a movie is that you run the risk of getting some who just aren't all that great at acting. But I cannot deny that, quite simply, this movie scared the living hell out of me more than any movie I've seen in the past eighteen years. It's base, it's manipulative, but it's brutally effective. As outright ludicrous as the comparison is, perhaps you should think of it as the thinking man's I Spit on Your Grave; it's just as manipulative and exploitative, but it relies on atmosphere instead of all those messy bits. So given how conflicted I am (and given how I want to get this out before the first showing on the east coast, which I think is in about an hour and a half as I write this), I'm going to give it the gentleman's C and let you decide. ***Oh, one other thing, and I can't believe I didn't say it it's so obvious: do not see this without seeing the first one. The final portion of the film will make basically no sense without it, and it contains THE major spoiler for Paranormal Activity. (See the first one with the original ending, if you can; I think the original ending may be on Youtube.)",3,Entirely unoriginal... but entirely effective.,1287705600,"10 22,

1357338,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B003Q6D25K,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","Thanks to ""Scream 2,"" everybody knows the rules for horror sequels - more gore, more exotic death scenes, more T&A;, and a nasty tendency to explain more about the villain, thereby making the villain less scary.  Based on these rules, virtually no horror sequel holds a candle to the original that sparked the franchise.Fortunately, the team behind ""Paranormal Activity 2"" knows these rules well enough to avoid them.  ""Paranormal Activity 2"" does not truly dive deeper into the story of Micah and Katie, the doomed couple from ""Paranormal Activity.""  Instead, this sequel expands upon their story by telling a parallel tale about Katie's sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden), her husband Dan (Brian Boland), Dan's teenage daughter Ali (Molly Iphraim) and their baby son Hunter.  Kristi and Katie have remained close, and this sequel takes place largely in the weeks leading up to Katie's and Micah's tale of terror.Kristi and Dan are delighted to bring Hunter home to their SoCal not-quite-McMansion.  They barbeque with Katie and Micah and shoot loving home movies in their bucolic backyard swimming pool.  But soon their house is broken into, and strangely, nothing is taken.  This little development is nothing more than a cute contrivance to get the same security-cam video structure that made the first movie so spooky.[Mild Spoiler Alert]  The installation of the security cams gets things rolling, as we now get to see the creepily low-budget yet realistic security footage of spectral beasties doing that voodoo that they do so well.  Certain film critics may sneer at this movie as a collection of ""gotcha"" moments, but the movie skilfully builds tension from small moments of fright to genuine terror.  We learn a bit more about Katie's history with the demon from the first movie, but not so much as to rip all the fun out of this story.If you liked the first movie, you will definitely appreciate that this movie goes to great lengths to add to the first movie rather than merely ride its coattails.",4,"Terrific elaboration on the original ""Paranormal Activity""",1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,2007,"['Thanks', 'Scream', '2', 'everybody', 'rules', 'horror', 'sequels', 'more', 'gore', 'more', 'exotic', 'death', 'scenes', 'more', 'T', 'A', 'nasty', 'tendency', 'explain', 'more', 'villain', 'thereby', 'making', 'villain', 'less', 'scary', 'Based', 'rules', 'virtually', 'horror', 'sequel', 'candle', 'original', 'sparked', 'franchise.Fortunately', 'team', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '2', 'rules', 'well', 'enough', 'avoid', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '2', 'not', 'truly', 'dive', 'deeper', 'story', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'doomed', 'couple', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Instead', 'sequel', 'story', 'telling', 'parallel', 'tale', 'Katie', 'sister', 'Kristi', 'Sprague', 'Grayden', 'husband', 'Dan', 'Brian', 'Boland', 'Dan', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Ali', 'Molly', 'Iphraim', 'baby', 'son', 'Hunter', 'Kristi', 'Katie', 'have', 'remained', 'close', 'sequel', 'place', 'largely', 'weeks', 'leading', 'up', 'Katie', 'Micah', 'tale', 'terror.Kristi', 'Dan', 'are', 'delighted', 'bring', 'Hunter', 'home', 'SoCal', 'not-quite-McMansion', 'barbeque', 'Katie', 'Micah', 'shoot', 'loving', 'home', 'movies', 'bucolic', 'backyard', 'swimming', 'pool', 'soon', 'house', 'broken', 'strangely', 'nothing', 'taken', 'little', 'development', 'nothing', 'more', 'cute', 'contrivance', 'get', 'same', 'security-cam', 'video', 'structure', 'made', 'first', 'movie', 'so', 'spooky', '[', 'Mild', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', ']', 'installation', 'security', 'things', 'rolling', 'now', 'get', 'see', 'creepily', 'low-budget', 'yet', 'realistic', 'security', 'footage', 'spectral', 'beasties', 'doing', 'voodoo', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'Certain', 'film', 'critics', 'may', 'sneer', 'movie', 'collection', 'gotcha', 'moments', 'movie', 'skilfully', 'tension', 'small', 'moments', 'fright', 'genuine', 'terror', 'learn', 'bit', 'more', 'Katie', 'history', 'demon', 'first', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'rip', 'fun', 'story.If', 'liked', 'first', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'great', 'lengths', 'add', 'first', 'movie', 'rather', 'merely', 'ride', 'coattails']",N/A

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[8, 17]","Last year I saw ""Paranormal Activity"" on my birthday so I was all excited to do the same thing again this year. I saw ""Paranormal Activity 2"" yesterday again on my birthday, but I certainly am glad that I only paid college movie theater prices ($5). I'd have been really annoyed if I paid beaucoup bucks to see the sequel. ""Paranormal Activity"" was creepy and exciting and weird. This movie included the lady in the last movie with her sister, and it talked about the connection between the siblings and what was going on outside of her home. The difference with the sequel is that there was a baby, a German Shepherd, a married couple, a teenage girl, a babysitter/maid and the teenage girl's boyfriend involved.My initial thought was, ""The first movie was so creepy because they had to depend on each other and there was no one to turn to."" This movie seemed to have too many people, but when the babysitter/maid was kicked out and the boyfriend wasn't constantly around, I thought, ""Okay, well, they're slowly filtering people out."" The keyword here is ""slowly."" This movie was entirely too slow. I could've sworn I saw night #19 two times, but why on Earth did it take so long to get to the action? I'm almost positive it was a good 40 minutes into the movie before viewers saw anything remotely scary or even exciting. I got so tired of looking at that dumb pool and the countertop. Enough! I wanted to be scared, and this movie was not fulfilling my paranoia request.Another problem I had--that any dog owner should, especially a German Shepherd owner of which I've lived with two--was that the dog was so relaxed when noises were heard. The teenage girl and the wife would go running downstairs anytime they heard anything, but the dog would stay in place. It wasn't like they told the dog to ""Stay."" The dog just wasn't around. She was in the baby's room just sleeping like she had a sedative. Dogs don't operate like this. If I stand up to go wash my hands, both dogs I've lived with are almost knocking me in the hip to get to the sink first. Even the most well-trained dog, especially German Shepherds who are naturally inquisitive and incredibly protective, will hear the noises LONG before a human would and will investigate. By the time the dog started acting like a dog I was bored with its whole existence.This movie just didn't cut it.

1357344,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B003Q6D25K,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","Paranormal Activity 2 starts out as a prequel to the original movie (starting several months earlier) and then moves forward to where the latter parts of the film are concurrent with Paranormal Activity 1.  In the first movie the fact that Katie had a sister was mentioned briefly but she was never seen.  In this chapter, the sister, Kristi, and her family are the main characters.  Kristi, her husband, and the husband's teenage daughter from a previous marriage, are welcoming a new baby into the family when strange things start to occur.  The major incident is an apparant home invasion with the whole house trashed but nothing seemingly taken.  After this event, the family has a number of security cameras installed inside and outside the house, and the rest of the movie covers what is caught on these cameras.Inexplicable events continue happening, and the possibility of some supernatural prescence is increasingly raised by everyone except that the father of the family, who firmly thinks that's all nonsense.  Of course, the intensity of these otherworldly manifestaions continues increasing...Much more backstory is given as to why all this is occuring, and although the hinted origins of the haunting are powerful, on the other hand it takes away a bit of the mystique.  In the first Paranormal Activity, I thought one of the things that made it so powerful and eerie was that no reasons were ever floated for what was happening.  The prescence fixated on Katie and, as we learned from her relating of events from her childhood, had done so before.  But the movie never attempted to explain why, or go in deep as to exactly what the prescence was or what it wanted.  Every discovery made, such as the photograph that turned up in the attic, raised more questions than it answered.  And I think that really made it scarier, the viewer was a much in the dark as to all the ""why""s as the characters, and it feels like there may not even be any ""why"", at least not that a human could understand.  Any motivation or origin behind the entity and the haunting are left not only to the best guesses of the characters, but to the viwer's interpretation.In Paranormal Activity 2, we get a much clearer picture as to why things are happening the way they are.  The explanations as to the origin of the hauntings is innovative and disturbing, but I almost think they should have left the origins here firmly in the 'unexplained' category, and they used the (admittedly cool) origin story in a whole different movie.  It looks like they're going to delve even further into the backstory in Paranormal Activity 3, and that could either go too far and rob the series of much of its mystique, or it could throw in some curveballs and restore that little portion that was kind of weakened.That possible weakening of the air of the unknown is the only weakness here, though.  The origin is frightening in its own right, and the whole movie is very well done, tremendously atmospheric and possessing some great jolts.  As with Part 1, there's a mix of scenes that unfold very slowly and creepily, where you really have to watch to see the supernatural elements taking hold, and much faster, more explosive scenes where the entity is gaining strength and things are coming to a head.

The goofy stuff starts shortly after Hunter is born. The house is ransacked, except for his room. So the family installs cameras in all the rooms, as well as walk around with a hand held camera all the time, plus a few camera shots that didn't fill either description, such as the OUIJA board scene.The house keeper suspects an evil spirit is in the house. The daughter thinks it is a demon from mom's side of the family after Hunter, and mom thinks it has something to do with the fact her and her sister cleavage used to hold seances. Dad is a skeptic and doesn't believe much of anything and the dog just barks. This is dad's second wife who seems only slightly older than his bikini daughter.The plot behind the movie isn't have bad but instead of having a sound track, a decent camera crew, and a token shower scene, we end up with another hand held yawner that bored me to tears as I spent half the time watching a pool crawler.

The truth is, very little happens during the first 75 minutes of the film, and the final 15 minutes are disappointing.  The problem here is two-fold.  First, the repetition - night after night of nothing happening gets boring fast.  Secondly, there are hardly any scares in the film (pool cleaners exiting the pool are not scary; neither are falling pots, closing doors or crying babies) and what few scares there are rely on cheap loud noises to startle the audience. I didn't like the first film, but at least its scares were well-earned.  For example, there is nothing here as remotely creepy as PA1's images of the girl hovering over her boyfriend for hours or the paw prints in the baby powder.  To make matters worse, there are some ridiculous things about this film such as the family not moving out once they saw the footage of the mom being dragged by an invisible presence.  What??!!

1357354,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B003Q6D25K,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[49, 54]","If you didn't like the first Paranormal Activity I strongly doubt you will enjoy Paranormal Activity 2 so don't even bother, stay far away from it. I was one of those who liked Paranormal Activity and thought it was entertaining and somewhat different from other horror movies as well. The concept of all these paranormal events going on and purposely cheaply-made film was intriguing and best of all, it worked. The thing is there were parts were I was genuinely scared, I couldn't help but be a little freaked out by what the characters were going through. This second PA movie is actually the prequel to the first one and not a traditional sequel like you would imagine, it has elements of both a prequel and a sequel (that's the best way of putting it). It can be a little difficult to imagine a second film that wouldn't ruin what the first one did, be different and still have the effect the first had. I was curious enough and found this one just as enjoyable as the first one. Paranormal Activity 2 doesn't really cover new ground but with careful improvements and changes, works just as well if not better than the original. I respect that they obviously didn't want to ruin what the first movie did which tends to be hard for a sequel, they clearly cared enough and wanted to show viewers something worthy (and I'll say it was).Paranormal Activity 2 begins two months before the first film and what happens in this prequel leads to the first. This time around the story is focused on Dan, his wife Kristi, Dan's daughter Ali and son Hunter who are-you guessed it-victim of paranormal activity. It's becoming clear to viewers that something is after baby Hunter and will go through anything to get him, even family members. Dan is a skeptic and refuses to talk about these events until it comes to a point he can no longer ignore. His daughter Ali believes and researches the events happening to the family. This leads to a situation. Now, the story is nothing new but it soon all falls into pieces. If you believe or not in these things is not the point, you are likely to be captivated, guessing and wondering what's coming next. What's interesting is that you see Katie and Micah from the first PA and you even see them at their house and Micah with his Camera. I felt this one explained more of what happened in PA which only helps of course. For me, when watching the first film it took some time to really get into it but once you're in, it's quite a ride. PA 2 is no different but there are some elements that made it even more enjoyable for me. It starts out nice and easy, then gradually things begin to happen and it gets progressively worse, it's a formula that worked well for the first and it also applies here. In this one the acting is much better, there are cameras all over the house and the story behind it all was really interesting. The family dog, a German shepherd named Abby who also feels a presence in the house; animals usually feel those types of things before humans do and only contributes to make things more interesting. In the first PA, it seemed things only happened when the characters were asleep, which made sense. This time around things happen both during night and day which adds another dimension to PA.I was definitely freaked out after viewing, I kept thinking about what I've just seen on the screen. Paranormal Activity is deeply psychological that's why it's so interesting to some and won't appeal to others. It certainly makes one think about the paranormal and raise questions, but that's probably what the filmmakers want you to do. If you liked the first one chances are you will also like this one, I probably enjoyed this prequel/sequel more than the first. I feared this one might be bad but I must say that the experience is just as valid as in the first movie. Some things about PA 2 are very similar to the first, yet it's also different in its own way, after all no one experiences things in the same way. Just to make things clear, it's not ""the scariest film ever!"" or ""the worst movie ever made"" as some reviewers said.

The cameras pick up much more then that.  If you have seen the first one you will know what to expect as far as the camera work and basic feel.  I did not realize going in that this was a prequel, in a way.  If you have seen the first one you will understand more of the aspects of the movie.  It's not really an easy movie to review.  The original scared the crap out of me, and I was tense all through this one too, not because it was really scary on its own, but more of a hangover from the first one.  The original was a better movie overall and this one felt forced, but it is still very much worth watching if you liked the first one.  It didn't scare me nearly as much as the first one, but I really liked the way they tied the two movies together.  Not really sure they need a 3rd one, but they are making one anyway.  I guess horror directors and studios just dont know when to stop.  I give it a B-.Would I watch it again? - I think I would, after re-watching the first one to see stuff I may have missed",3,"Alot like the original, just not as good.

1357357,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003Q6D25K,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""Paranormal Activity 2"" is a prequel to the horror film released in 2009. The new chapter, which takes place several months before the events described in the first entry, revolves around Kristi Rey (Sprague Grayden), sister of the original's heroine Katie (Katie Featherston), and Kristi's family - Daniel (Brian Boland), his teenage daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim) and a baby named Hunter.The basic storyline is almost the same as the first installment. In a sense this is not surprising. Perhaps the producers thought (rightly) that they had to turn the previous year's surprise hit into a franchise quickly. So in ""PA2"" scares sometimes look recycled, using unexpected loud sound and moving objects. Despite the new characters (and a dog), sometimes I felt as if watching a remake, not a prequel, of the earlier film.The story of ""Paranormal Activity 2"" (especially its introductory part) unfolds at a faster speed. With footage ostensibly shot by the family's camcorder and several surveillance cameras installed in the house, the film tries to retain the same visual touch as the first one, but the tighter editing and more polished camerawork (and special effects) suggest a bigger budget and professional skills behind the supernatural phenomena.That is not bad thing.
