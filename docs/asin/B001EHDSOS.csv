1185761,A2SO8REV9AUHTU,B001EHDSOS,M.K.,"[0, 0]","In this day and age, TV shows from television's yesteryears are becoming more commonplace daily.  I never thought of the day that Doug would ever be released on DVD.For those of you who doesn't remember, don't want to remember or just too young to remember, Doug was one of the first original Nicktoons (along with Rugrats and The Ren and Stimpy Show) distributed by Nickelodeon during its famed ""Golden Age"" in 1991.It was created by cartoonist Jim Jinkins, a Nickelodeon alum from another Nick show, Pinwheel.  It follows the adventures of Douglas Yancey Funnie, an imaginative 11-year-old who moves with his family from Bloatsburg to the city of Bluffington, gaining new friends (and enemies) along the way.Though a lot of fans will probably disagree with me, the show somehow shows a lot of racial diversity through an array of everyday characters, like Doug's family (his mom, dad and older, quirky sister Judy), his pet dog, Porkchop, his zany friend, Skeeter Valentine, and his neighbors, the Dinks.  How can we forget about his enemies (school bully Roger Klotz and his gang) and the school's assistant principal, Lamarr Bone?  Well, we can't because they help to make Doug's new Bluffington life more interesting (and complex).  The thing that tripped me out was one of Doug's main motivation:  romancing the heart of his secret crush, the lovely Patty Mayonnaise.What would Doug be without his alter egos: school evader Jack Bandit, the superheroics of Quailman and Quaildog, and the adventures of the suave and debonair secret agent, Smash Adams?  Answer:  they would be boring if not for these.The unforgettable melody of the show's theme songs helps to round out the song.  Plus, for its first time out of the gate, the animation was on point.  It's all good when both Amazon.com and Nickelodeon came to a deal to finally release this and many more of Nick's classic shows on DVD.  Though I was disappointed about no special features included, it didn't matter much to me because I can finally own it on DVD format.Keep it up, Amazon.com!  Bring out Season 3!

1185770,A1IHIRY5V85C7J,B001EHDSOS,Robert Cruz,"[57, 59]","Introduction (Taken from the DVD set):Tune in to this classic show featuring Doug and his pals Skeeter, Patti, Roger and Beebe. They dance, they camp, they doodle, they play, and they...blow up the science room? It's one wild adventure after another with Doug and all his pals.Memorable Episodes:As someone who has seen the show during its original run, it's really tough to pick out just a few memorable episodes...each episode holds a special place for me! There are a few obvious ones, though, and I'll go over those. In the premiere episode ""Doug Bags A Neematoad"", Doug and his family move to Bluffington, and worries that he won't make any friends there. He experiences the good...and the bad, but in the end, it's all one big learning experience.In ""Doug Gets Busted"", as described in the introduction, Doug creates a volcano for a science experiment, and when a rumor is spread that it caused the lab to explode, Doug becomes ""Jack Bandit"" to run away from possible trouble.In ""Doug Rocks"", Doug and Skeeter get a chance to see The Beets live, but Skeeter gets grounded. Doug wants to go, but decides to stick with his best friend. They get a nice surprise in the end, on their visit to the Honker Burger.In ""Doug Is Quailman"", Doug begins to doodle his favorite cartoon superhero, Quailman, and imagines himself as the title hero, in his own adventures.Packaging:The packaging is a very standard Amaray-style case, which holds the three discs. The case actually feels quite sturdy, and the discs do not overlap each other. The artwork is simple, and it gets the job done. The discs themselves are printed on a nice, glossy, and high quality label, which gives it a professional look and feel to it. Episodes are all listed on the back of the case, without descriptions.Menu:The menus are very simple..almost too simple. They don't really look professionally done. I'm sure anyone could pull off a better menu using Nero. Main menu gives you the options of Play All or Episode Selection.Video/Audio Quality:If you're familiar with Doug during its original airings, or even the reruns on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons Network, you're probably familiar with the quality of the show. Pretty much the norm of Nickelodeon shows (and Nicktoons), they resemble that of VHS quality. Honestly, I don't think any cleaning up was done to these episodes, but don't get too worried, cause there's probably not much that could be done to the episodes anyway. Video isn't too consistent, plenty of color changes at random, a bit dull and not too bright in the color department...but hey, that's just reviewing the original source. Some episodes do look fairly sharp. I didn't notice any visible compression on any of the episodes. Audio is in 2.0 stereo, as originally aired, and pretty much makes use of both channels well enough. Dialogue is clear and volume is consistent. I didn't notice any problems with the audio at all.As for episode lengths, despite it being a Paramount property, it's being released through Amazon's Burn-On-Demand feature, courtesy of CreateSpace, so don't worry about any ""Some episodes may be edited..."" nonsense that is typical of CBS Paramount releases. If you want to see consistency, the lengths are very consistent, depending of course. Take note, though, not all episodes have the intro intact, but I guess that has to do with the DVDs each being one long feature, broken down by chapter. I'm not a fan of this at all, but I guess the intro is there in some form, at least. You'll notice that the episodes with the intro are maybe a second or two apart, and the episodes without the intro are also a second or two apart from each other. Ending credits are intact on all episodes, and for the closing logo fans, the dark blue variant of the Jumbo Pictures logo and the Nickelodeon logo with the 1991 copyright year are both present. Episodes (with lengths) are as follows, per disc:Disc 1:1. Doug Bags A Neematoad (23:33)2. Doug Can't Dance / Doug Gets Busted (23:31)3. Doug's Dog's Date / Doug's Big Nose (22:46) *4. Doug Takes a Hike / Doug Rocks (22:47) *Disc 2:5. Doug Can't Dig It / Doug Didn't Do It (23:31)6. Doug, Mayor for a Day / Doug's No Dummy (23:33)7. Doug to the Rescue / Doug's Cool Shoes (22:46) *8. Doug Gets His Ears Lowered / Doug On The Wild Side (22:47) *Disc 3:9. Doug's Big Catch / Doug Needs Money (23:32)10. Doug's Doodle / Doug's Runaway Journal (22:47) *11. Doug's Cookin' / Doug Loses Dale (22:47) *12. Doug is Quailman / Doug Out in Left Field (22:46) *13. Doug's Fair Lady / Doug Says Goodbye (22:46) *Note: * represents episodes with the intro missing.Special Features:In a perfect world, there'd be promos, behind the scenes, commentary, deleted scenes, and much, much more. Sadly, this isn't a perfect world. You're just getting the episodes here. Nothing more, nothing less.Final Comments:Despite lack of extras and very cheap-looking menus, Doug is finally out on DVD. The episodes are uncut (minus a few missing intros), and the quality on par with the original airings. If you are a fan of the show, Nickelodeon, or the 90's in general, buy this DVD (and season 2)! The show hasn't been on reruns in a while (at least, in the US), so there's one more reason to buy it. If you need one more reason, think of it like this: Paramount damn sure won't put it out on DVD themselves, after the Nick Rewind collection failed badly in sales, so this is the only chance it has of getting an official DVD release. I highly recommend it, and here's hoping seasons 3 and 4 are added to CreateSpace.",4,"A very thorough and detailed review, for those still contemplating on buying this set...",1222387200,"09 26,
