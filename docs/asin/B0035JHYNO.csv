1326551,A24PTVSZSM8968,B0035JHYNO,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is a former TV movie. It follows a fairly standard plot with a lot of expected plot devices for a TV romantic comedy. It is the story of a girl who cares for her sick father while volunteering at a church and studying to be a teacher. She ends up taking a job for a widowed father and his two kids who have driven off 20 or so previous nannies. Of course the kids try to drive her off with all sorts of tricks, but she turns the tables on them and eventually manages to gain the trust of the younger one. By the end of the movie, she even manages to break through with the older kid and the father. There are a number of things about this movie that aren't so great. The first part of the movie seems sort of cheesy and not well-done. The ending is probably one of the more unrealistic endings for a story like this. There are also a number of things in between that don't quite add up. The heroine is supposed to be studying to become a teacher and the end of the movie shows her in a classroom as a teacher just a short time after the rest of the action without any indication of her having done any student teaching or having graduated. There are a couple of secondary characters that have the beginnings of a their own stories, but which are never really followed through in much detail. In spite of some of these shortcomings, once you get past the first ten minutes or so of the movie, it becomes an enjoyable little low-key movie with a lot of heart. You end up liking the characters and feeling pretty good about what happened with the possible exception of an overdone ending. The main character is a fairly well-known actress who does an excellent job of looking like a shy, lonely girl at first while making a transition to a confident and attractive one at the end. She has a stunning similarity to a young Sandra Bullock and could probably play her sister in a movie. Overall, this movie is no classic, but it is clean and enjoyable.",4,Good in spite of the bad,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,1951,"['former', 'TV', 'movie', 'fairly', 'standard', 'plot', 'lot', 'expected', 'plot', 'devices', 'TV', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'sick', 'father', 'volunteering', 'church', 'studying', 'be', 'teacher', 'up', 'taking', 'job', 'widowed', 'father', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'driven', 'off', '20', 'so', 'previous', 'nannies', 'course', 'kids', 'try', 'drive', 'off', 'sorts', 'tricks', 'tables', 'eventually', 'manages', 'gain', 'trust', 'younger', 'one', 'end', 'movie', 'even', 'break', 'older', 'kid', 'father', 'are', 'number', 'things', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'sort', 'cheesy', 'not', 'well-done', 'ending', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'endings', 'story', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'add', 'up', 'heroine', 'supposed', 'be', 'studying', 'become', 'teacher', 'end', 'movie', 'classroom', 'teacher', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'rest', 'action', 'indication', 'having', 'done', 'student', 'teaching', 'having', 'graduated', 'are', 'couple', 'secondary', 'characters', 'have', 'beginnings', 'own', 'stories', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'followed', 'much', 'detail', 'spite', 'shortcomings', 'once', 'get', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'low-key', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'characters', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'good', 'what', 'happened', 'possible', 'exception', 'overdone', 'ending', 'main', 'character', 'fairly', 'well-known', 'actress', 'who', 'excellent', 'job', 'looking', 'shy', 'lonely', 'girl', 'first', 'making', 'transition', 'confident', 'attractive', 'one', 'end', 'stunning', 'similarity', 'young', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'could', 'probably', 'play', 'sister', 'movie', 'Overall', 'movie', 'classic', 'clean', 'enjoyable']",N/A

1326568,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,B0035JHYNO,D. Blankenship,"[2, 2]","What a pleasing movie this one is.  I will tell you right off that the story is quite predictable and the theme has been used in quite a number of movies over the years.  There are no special effects here, no violence, nothing is blown-up and there is absolutely no cursing.  The most torrid love scenes in the entire movie are two rather chaste and sweet kisses.  There is no nudity and the music is extremely mellow and pleasing to the ear.A young girl (actually a young woman), has been taking care of her ill father since she was a teen.  She has been working her way through school to become a school teacher.  The young woman lost her mother when she was very young.  Our heroine is offered a job as a nanny and accepts.Enter the family which consists of a guy and his two children.  The wife has been killed by a drunk driver and the father who is a professional, wealthy and good looking (in addition to being a very nice guy), has a boy and a girl.  The kids are brats, in particular the young girl who is having a dreadful time accepting the death of her mother.The new nanny has her job cut out for her.  The children have run nanny after nanny off via their rude and poor behavior.  Will our young heroine be able to turn this family around?  Will she able to help the two children?  Will she find true love?The acting in this one is good.  There is a gentle but not overwhelming religious tone to the movie, i.e. faith in God will see you through if you can just find and keep it; an excellent message.  The minister is played by a rather aging and chubby Stacy Keach (One of my favorites) and the about to die father is played by Dean Stockwell who in my opinion is one of the better character actors working today.  Both play excellent parts.Like other reviewers here, I cannot classify this one as a romantic comedy (my favorite genre) because it does have a rather serious and important theme to it, but that being said it is rather funny at times, is romantic and has the ""feel.""  I suppose if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck...well, you know what I mean.The only complaint I have about the whole movie is the title...how on earth they came up with ""The Nanny Express"" is beyond me.This is a story of faith, of love and people helping their fellow humans through difficult times.

Most people would skip movies like that because they think they are too predictable or ""lame"", but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". Nanny Express was really quite clean.  There are regular on-screne acts of romance (kissing), a few utterances of mild obscenity, a couple is shown drinking wine, and there is not violence or nudity. There is several discussions of a mother of children who was killed by drunk driver on her daughter's birthday, and the father of the children's nanny is terminally ill and passes away.  The daughter of the family also lies several times (but she regrets it and tries to make up for it in the end).  The Dove Foundation gave it four stars and approved it suitable for all ages.It starts out with two children (Emily and Ben) who make nanny after nanny quit, because of the pranks the children pull on them (scaring them with the pet rat, making the washing machine overflow, locking them out of the house).  The dad (David) asks them to promise to not ""plot, plan or stratagize the demise of another nanny""...which they promise...and then don't keep that promise. Finally, David hires Kate, who lost her mother to cancer when she was in high school, and is now taking car of her terminally ill father; while trying to balance work, school and tutoring kids at her church.  Slowly, Ben warms up to Kate, after she impresses him by turning the tables on the kids by locking them out of the house and turning the sprinklers on them, and when she acts calm when he tries to scare her with his pet rat. She has also taught him how to better understand his math homework.  David, not used to having someone else in the house whom he can talk to, starts to fall for Kate as well, but is worried to do anything about it for fear of losing another nanny (let alone the only nanny that hasn't quit in a matter of hours) if things don't work out.  However, he may lose her anyway.  Emily, his teenage daughter, who is still hurting over the death of her mother, has no interest in having this new woman in her or her dad's life, and will do anything she can to get rid of herThe only things that I didn't like about the movie, is with all the tactics the kids use to get rid of all the nanny's, their Dad never punished them for it.  When the daughter is downright rude to Kate, and he is standing right next to his daughter, he doesn't say anything.  I guess the upside is that the daughter does regret her actions at the end and tries to make up for it.  The other thing I didn't like is throughout the whole show the daughter is especially angry and rude to Kate, whenever she brings up the kids mother, (David didn't tell Kate at the beginning that his wife was dead) and Kate never mentions that she lost her mother too. At the end she said it just never felt like the right time, but throughout the show, there where at least 3 absolutely perfect places where the daughter would have responded well to it...desperate for anyone who could help her.  Obviously, Emily is really struggling with the death of her mother, especially since it happened on Emily's birthday.  No one seems to see that she is falling into this hole and no one tries to help her.  Finally at the end, after all Emily has tried to do to get rid of Kate, Kate reaches out one last time to let Emily know that there is one person who understands what she has gone through and has risen above it.  She encourages Emily to ""just try to keep the faith"" and one day she will realize that she had a good day.  Emily finally accept this message and a new friend.Overall, I really liked the movie and will watch it again.",5,Nanny Express - would watch again,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,3754,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'movies', 'think', 'are', 'too', 'predictable', 'lame', 'love', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'slimed', 'Nanny', 'Express', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'clean', 'are', 'regular', 'on-screne', 'acts', 'romance', 'kissing', 'few', 'utterances', 'mild', 'obscenity', 'couple', 'shown', 'drinking', 'wine', 'not', 'violence', 'nudity', 'several', 'discussions', 'mother', 'children', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'drunk', 'driver', 'daughter', 'birthday', 'father', 'children', 'nanny', 'terminally', 'ill', 'away', 'daughter', 'family', 'also', 'several', 'times', 'make', 'up', 'end', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'approved', 'suitable', 'ages.It', 'out', 'two', 'children', 'Emily', 'Ben', 'who', 'make', 'nanny', 'nanny', 'quit', 'pranks', 'children', 'pull', 'scaring', 'pet', 'rat', 'making', 'washing', 'machine', 'overflow', 'locking', 'house', 'dad', 'David', 'promise', 'not', 'plot', 'plan', 'stratagize', 'demise', 'nanny', 'promise', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'promise', 'Finally', 'David', 'Kate', 'who', 'lost', 'mother', 'cancer', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'now', 'taking', 'car', 'terminally', 'ill', 'father', 'trying', 'balance', 'work', 'school', 'tutoring', 'kids', 'church', 'Slowly', 'Ben', 'up', 'Kate', 'turning', 'tables', 'kids', 'locking', 'house', 'turning', 'sprinklers', 'when', 'calm', 'when', 'scare', 'pet', 'rat', 'also', 'taught', 'how', 'better', 'understand', 'math', 'homework', 'David', 'not', 'used', 'having', 'someone', 'else', 'house', 'whom', 'can', 'talk', 'starts', 'fall', 'Kate', 'as', 'well', 'worried', 'do', 'anything', 'fear', 'losing', 'nanny', 'let', 'alone', 'only', 'nanny', ""n't"", 'quit', 'matter', 'hours', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'However', 'may', 'lose', 'anyway', 'Emily', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'still', 'hurting', 'death', 'mother', 'interest', 'having', 'new', 'woman', 'dad', 'life', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'get', 'rid', 'herThe', 'only', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'tactics', 'kids', 'use', 'get', 'rid', 'nanny', 'Dad', 'never', 'punished', 'When', 'daughter', 'downright', 'rude', 'Kate', 'standing', 'right', 'next', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'guess', 'upside', 'daughter', 'regret', 'actions', 'end', 'tries', 'make', 'up', 'other', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'whole', 'show', 'daughter', 'especially', 'angry', 'rude', 'Kate', 'whenever', 'up', 'kids', 'mother', 'David', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Kate', 'beginning', 'wife', 'was', 'dead', 'Kate', 'never', 'mentions', 'lost', 'mother', 'too', 'end', 'said', 'just', 'never', 'felt', 'right', 'time', 'show', 'where', 'least', '3', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'places', 'where', 'daughter', 'would', 'have', 'responded', 'well', 'desperate', 'anyone', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'Obviously', 'Emily', 'really', 'struggling', 'death', 'mother', 'especially', 'happened', 'Emily', 'birthday', 'one', 'see', 'falling', 'hole', 'one', 'help', 'Finally', 'end', 'Emily', 'tried', 'do', 'get', 'rid', 'Kate', 'Kate', 'out', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'let', 'Emily', 'know', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'what', 'gone', 'risen', 'Emily', 'just', 'try', 'keep', 'faith', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'realize', 'had', 'good', 'day', 'Emily', 'finally', 'accept', 'message', 'new', 'friend.Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

Meanwhile, Kate is coping with a father with heart disease, being laid off from her job, working on getting her teaching degree and tutoring kids from low-income families at her church. The driver of the bus on her regular route (and soon-to-be her best friend's boyfriend) connects her with a job because his sister  runs a business providing housekeepers and nannies. That is how the Chandlers meet Kate.She has the same pranks pulled on her that 9-year-old Ben and 15-year-old Emily played on all of their other victims, but she needs the job, so she sticks with it. She also sees in Emily the shadows of her own past and hopes that she will be able to help her.  Ben begins to thaw toward her, but Emily remains cold and disdainful. This is the hardest part of this movie for me. The father seems completely clueless as to how to teach his daughter to show respect to others. She continually treats the nanny in demeaning ways and the father witnesses it and does little or nothing, other than apologize to Kate for her behavior. It is as if the death of her mother three years ago excuses her from accountability for her actions.David Chandler is so grateful that Kate has stayed that when he finds himself attracted to her he hesitates to show itfor fear that things might not work out between them and then he will have lost the only nanny that stayed more than a day. Kate is attracted to him, but isn't sure of his feelings at first.Emily is aware of what is happening between her father and Kate and she does her best to sabatoge the relationship. It appears that she is successful.**Spoiler Alert**A turn of events in Kate's life causes her to quit her nanny job, but she returns to the Chandler home (I don't think I mentioned that Kate describes their home as being bigger than the whole apartment complex in which she lives) to give Emily a present on her 16th birthday. Emily is anything but grateful and doesn't bother opening it.In Kate's mind her association with the Chandler family is over and she is trying to move on with her life, but then Emily finally opens her gift and the surprising content causes a change of heart. She confesses her meddling to her father and the family sets out to get Kate back.I always struggle with bratty kids in movies--luckily these do change. Kate is such a sweet, patient person and maybe a little ""too-good-to-be-true,"" but she is sustained by her faith and that is a positive message that we could use more of these days. If you can overlook Emily's attitude problem and the fact that she gets a brand new luxury car for her 16th birthday, it is a fun chick-flick.",4,Where is Super Nanny when you need her?,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,2767,"['movie', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'experienced', '20+', 'nannies', 'who', 'have', 'tried', 'cope', '2', 'children', 'David', 'Chandler', 'Meanwhile', 'Kate', 'coping', 'father', 'heart', 'disease', 'being', 'laid', 'off', 'job', 'working', 'getting', 'teaching', 'degree', 'tutoring', 'kids', 'low-income', 'families', 'church', 'driver', 'bus', 'regular', 'route', 'soon-to-be', 'best', 'friend', 'boyfriend', 'job', 'sister', 'business', 'providing', 'housekeepers', 'nannies', 'how', 'Chandlers', 'meet', 'Kate.She', 'same', 'pranks', 'pulled', '9-year-old', 'Ben', '15-year-old', 'Emily', 'played', 'other', 'victims', 'job', 'also', 'Emily', 'shadows', 'own', 'past', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'Ben', 'thaw', 'Emily', 'cold', 'disdainful', 'hardest', 'part', 'movie', 'father', 'completely', 'clueless', 'how', 'teach', 'daughter', 'show', 'respect', 'others', 'continually', 'nanny', 'demeaning', 'ways', 'father', 'little', 'nothing', 'other', 'apologize', 'Kate', 'behavior', 'death', 'mother', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'accountability', 'actions.David', 'Chandler', 'so', 'grateful', 'Kate', 'stayed', 'when', 'attracted', 'show', 'itfor', 'fear', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'lost', 'only', 'nanny', 'stayed', 'more', 'day', 'Kate', 'attracted', ""n't"", 'sure', 'feelings', 'first.Emily', 'aware', 'what', 'happening', 'father', 'Kate', 'best', 'sabatoge', 'relationship', 'successful', '**Spoiler', 'Alert**A', 'turn', 'events', 'Kate', 'life', 'quit', 'nanny', 'job', 'Chandler', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mentioned', 'Kate', 'home', 'being', 'bigger', 'whole', 'apartment', 'complex', 'give', 'Emily', 'present', '16th', 'birthday', 'Emily', 'anything', 'grateful', ""n't"", 'bother', 'opening', 'it.In', 'Kate', 'mind', 'association', 'Chandler', 'family', 'trying', 'move', 'life', 'then', 'Emily', 'finally', 'gift', 'surprising', 'content', 'change', 'heart', 'meddling', 'father', 'family', 'out', 'get', 'Kate', 'back.I', 'always', 'struggle', 'bratty', 'kids', 'movies', 'luckily', 'do', 'change', 'Kate', 'such', 'sweet', 'patient', 'person', 'maybe', 'little', 'too-good-to-be-true', 'sustained', 'faith', 'positive', 'message', 'could', 'use', 'more', 'days', 'can', 'overlook', 'Emily', 'attitude', 'problem', 'fact', 'brand', 'new', 'luxury', 'car', '16th', 'birthday', 'fun', 'chick-flick']",N/A

This one is a refreshing surprise!My wife and I decided to sit this one through, and yes, of course, you pretty much know what's going to happen from start to finish.  A young teacher to be takes a nanny position from a rich, handsome guy(Can there be any other type?)widower who has two bratty children.  This is lighthearted fair, but with a couple dramatic elements, basically dealing with the death of one's parents.  Also, I wouldn't call it a true romantic comedy because the protaganist don't spend the first half of the movie hating/fighting with one another; nonetheless, a potential romance ensues.Two of my favorite, stalwart actors perform well in their small but important roles: Dean Stockwell as the nanny's 'hanging-on-to-his-last-gasp', loving father and Stacy Keach as the tad potbellied, sympathetic, wise minister.  I love these guys, they act without acting!Produced by Faith and Family Entertainment, they live up to their name.  It's clean, and the story gently stresses faith in God, seeing things through, and love.My one complaint, they do play the music non-stop through the movie, but thankfully, it's not has syrupy as most.  You know, it's difficult to make a fully balanced movie, and I think more so with family fare, and have all the elements work well.If you need a bit more meat, bite or uncertainty in a flick, you're not going to like this one, but for us and for this type of genre, we found it satisfying.
