Walther ""carldub""","[0, 0]","This movie is about two Japanese &#34;pirates&#34; who are in China, one of which wants to show the superiority of the Japanese sword and the technique of using it.  This sword is much longer than a Katana, and is not curved as a Katana is.  One of the men is captured, but the other is boxed in and forced to fight a very subtle fight to stay alive.  There is much intrigue and mystery involved in this very well made movie.

1547301,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0087AOYG6,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 5]","THE SWORD IDENTITY (Orig. title WO KOU DE ZONG JI, 2011, 111 minutes) must be one of the most simultaneously rewarding and downright confusing martial arts films ever conceived. A master from China conversant with its history might appreciate this in full. I could only appreciate it in pieces, or rather, piecemeal.Set in the Mind Dynasty - though I rather question both the costumes I saw and the dialect as I heard it - an argument sets in among the martial arts school masters as to how to deal with a Japanese pirate who has infiltrated the unidentified city.To simplify the background: a military general previously perfected a technique that would defeat the Japanese katana as it was back then. Another general, and I think this was the first general's brother, developed a technique that would defeat the warrior rather than the sword.The military strategy was an attack formation to defeat the Japanese ""pirates""; the martial arts technique was designed to beat their sword. At least that is how I saw it and understood it. The trouble is, in one of the martial arts schools the leader, once a general, copied then altered the katana design.This was considered ""evil"" by the Chinese who later forbade its use. Now as I see it, the actual Japanese ""pirate"" - who is one of the young martial arts masters serving under the general who reengineered the sword - is trying to prove to the Chinese authorities that the sword system should be treasured and taught.You know, in case the Japanese ever decided to come calling again. Oh, and this young whippersnapper also wants the ""anti-Japanese"" techniques to be officially taught.This film showed some Chinese and Japanese martial arts etiquette as I was taught them. That much is true. The techniques are rather dazzling, obviously phony, but based on actual techniques such as what we now know as the T'ai Ch'i Cane. Also I appreciated the little-addressed issue of the military and the martial arts masters frowning on each other. That part was true enough in the past - and still true to this day.What is terrible about this is the producers obviously have weak senses of heritage, both cultural and cinematic. This is mostly like a bad Japanese film and the copying from Japanese directors is so painful to see that I won't even begin to describe it. In fact I had to pretend it was an alien world and that I was watching the origins of the Jedi to get me all the way through this thing.Try it: it might work for you.Reading the so-called reviews here on Amazon, I understand. That is what bothers the West about this film: the audience wanted to see old masters kicking each others' butts all over the place. Did you not hear the old Gandalf-lookalike master?""A master does not fight that way: he strikes only once, and wins.""Ah well, even a film can't always follow its own message.This thing has cool innovations and enough stupid confusion in the storyline to keep you guessing - but I say ""PASS"". There are excellent films galore you can waste your money on without bothering to watch this even once. If you can see it for free, then no harm done. You might even learn a few things.Something definitely beneficial about films like this: they will make you crave for bigger and better things, and those films are out there. Life does not being and end withCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Try this tiny sampling on for size:Shaolin(see my review);Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame DVD(see my review);Hung Hei-Koon: Shaolin's Five Founders(see my review); andIP MAN COMPLETE SET # 1-2-3(see my review, of course).There, this lousy film achieves that goal at least, and my list of personal recommendations ought to keep you happy and sated for at least a few days. There's lots more where that came from, the ONE good thing China has given our economy. That, and chopsticks.I gave it 2 stars after weighing and deciding against 3 stars, because of the overall technical quality. It gets one for that and ONE star for martial arts value.Or as they say in China, ""I am most humbly indebted to the givers for this gift and may they live an interesting life.""",2,A master strikes once - this film strikes out,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,4132,"['SWORD', 'IDENTITY', 'Orig', 'title', 'WO', 'KOU', 'DE', 'ZONG', 'JI', '2011', '111', 'minutes', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'simultaneously', 'rewarding', 'downright', 'confusing', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'ever', 'conceived', 'master', 'China', 'conversant', 'history', 'might', 'appreciate', 'full', 'could', 'only', 'appreciate', 'pieces', 'rather', 'piecemeal.Set', 'Mind', 'Dynasty', 'rather', 'question', 'costumes', 'saw', 'dialect', 'heard', 'argument', 'sets', 'martial', 'arts', 'school', 'masters', 'how', 'deal', 'Japanese', 'pirate', 'who', 'infiltrated', 'unidentified', 'city.To', 'simplify', 'background', 'military', 'general', 'previously', 'perfected', 'technique', 'would', 'defeat', 'Japanese', 'katana', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'general', 'think', 'was', 'first', 'general', 'brother', 'developed', 'technique', 'would', 'defeat', 'warrior', 'rather', 'sword.The', 'military', 'strategy', 'was', 'attack', 'formation', 'defeat', 'Japanese', 'pirates', 'martial', 'arts', 'technique', 'was', 'designed', 'beat', 'sword', 'least', 'how', 'saw', 'understood', 'trouble', 'one', 'martial', 'arts', 'schools', 'leader', 'once', 'general', 'copied', 'then', 'altered', 'katana', 'design.This', 'was', 'considered', 'evil', 'Chinese', 'who', 'later', 'forbade', 'use', 'Now', 'see', 'actual', 'Japanese', 'pirate', 'who', 'one', 'young', 'martial', 'arts', 'masters', 'serving', 'general', 'who', 'reengineered', 'sword', 'trying', 'prove', 'Chinese', 'authorities', 'sword', 'system', 'should', 'be', 'treasured', 'taught.You', 'know', 'case', 'Japanese', 'ever', 'decided', 'come', 'calling', 'again', 'Oh', 'young', 'whippersnapper', 'also', 'anti-Japanese', 'techniques', 'be', 'officially', 'taught.This', 'film', 'showed', 'Chinese', 'Japanese', 'martial', 'arts', 'etiquette', 'was', 'taught', 'much', 'true', 'techniques', 'are', 'rather', 'dazzling', 'obviously', 'phony', 'based', 'actual', 'techniques', 'such', 'what', 'now', 'know', ""T'ai"", 'Ch', 'i', 'Cane', 'Also', 'appreciated', 'little-addressed', 'issue', 'military', 'martial', 'arts', 'masters', 'frowning', 'other', 'part', 'was', 'true', 'enough', 'past', 'still', 'true', 'day.What', 'terrible', 'producers', 'obviously', 'have', 'weak', 'senses', 'heritage', 'cultural', 'cinematic', 'mostly', 'bad', 'Japanese', 'film', 'copying', 'Japanese', 'directors', 'so', 'painful', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'fact', 'had', 'pretend', 'was', 'alien', 'world', 'was', 'watching', 'origins', 'Jedi', 'get', 'way', 'thing.Try', 'might', 'work', 'you.Reading', 'so-called', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'understand', 'what', 'West', 'film', 'audience', 'wanted', 'see', 'old', 'masters', 'kicking', 'others', 'butts', 'place', 'Did', 'not', 'hear', 'old', 'Gandalf-lookalike', 'master', 'master', 'not', 'fight', 'way', 'only', 'once', 'wins', 'Ah', 'well', 'even', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'follow', 'own', 'message.This', 'thing', 'cool', 'innovations', 'enough', 'stupid', 'confusion', 'storyline', 'keep', 'guessing', 'say', 'PASS', 'are', 'excellent', 'films', 'can', 'waste', 'money', 'bothering', 'watch', 'even', 'once', 'can', 'see', 'free', 'then', 'harm', 'done', 'might', 'even', 'learn', 'few', 'things.Something', 'definitely', 'beneficial', 'films', 'will', 'make', 'crave', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'films', 'are', 'there', 'Life', 'not', 'being', 'end', 'withCrouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'Try', 'tiny', 'sampling', 'size', 'Shaolin', 'see', 'review', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'Mystery', 'Phantom', 'Flame', 'DVD', 'see', 'review', 'Hung', 'Hei-Koon', 'Shaolin', 'Five', 'Founders', 'see', 'review', 'andIP', 'MAN', 'COMPLETE', 'SET', '1-2-3', 'see', 'review', 'course', '.There', 'lousy', 'film', 'achieves', 'goal', 'least', 'list', 'personal', 'recommendations', 'ought', 'keep', 'happy', 'sated', 'least', 'few', 'days', 'lots', 'more', 'where', 'came', 'ONE', 'good', 'thing', 'China', 'given', 'economy', 'chopsticks.I', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'weighing', 'deciding', '3', 'stars', 'overall', 'technical', 'quality', 'one', 'ONE', 'star', 'martial', 'arts', 'value.Or', 'say', 'China', 'am', 'most', 'humbly', 'indebted', 'givers', 'gift', 'may', 'live', 'interesting', 'life']",The Sword Identity
