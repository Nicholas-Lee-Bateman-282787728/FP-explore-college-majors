As a result, the English cast is not the one you are accustom to and this may put people off.  However, if you've been watching the DVD's and using the Japanese audio, the Japanese cast is the same (as best as I can tell).  You should have seen the TV series through DVD volume 9 in order to understand everything that goes on here.  If you've never seen the show, you are going to have a difficult time understanding who the characters are and their relationship to each other.Story-wise, Spirit World is under attack and Botan barely makes it to Earth to alert Yusuke.  Thus Yusuke and his crew have to fight demons from the supposedly banished Netherworld.  We have some of the typical one-on-one battles the series is famous for but this time we actually get to see the boys work as a team!  The ending is kind of weak in that I would have enjoyed seeing an aftermath portion, but that didn't happen.Bottom line:  YYH is an anime title I have a weakness for.

Spoor ""Author, Gamer, Geek God""","[6, 6]","The &quot;God-Warrior&quot; subgenre of anime basically focuses on teams of human warriors gifted with extraordinary powers who are chosen to fight against gods/demons with major world-conquering ambitions. The original God-Warrior anime is generally considered to be Saint Seiya; others include Yoroiden Samurai Troopers (&quot;Ronin Warriors&quot;), Shurato, and the parodic approach of Sailor Moon.YuuYuu Hakusho broke several of the standard tropes, starting with not being a five-team (four main characters), and eliminating special costumes. Then they made sure to be distinct by making all of their characters not-nice people. The nicest one is Kuwabera, a gang leader who's always lived his life by his fists but who shows a surprising secret heroic streak. The others range down from there, with the sarcastic Yuske and the fox-demon Kurama about equal and the demonic Hiei (who appears to be Vegita's [DBZ] love child, judging on appearances) coming in dead last on the &quot;Guy I want to actually MEET&quot; sweepstakes.Because of these changes, YuuYuu was able to provide some plotlines and approaches the others could not, keeping it fresh even while it otherwise followed genre conventions to the letter. The YuuYuu Hakusho movie epitomizes all of the best features of YuuYuu Hakusho, including the characterizations, the twists of plot, and the dramatic battles. The villains are actually rather inventive for a show which like so many anime has only buttkicking as its _raison d'etre_, and the grand finale against the dark god, king of the Netherworld, Yakumo, is worth the price of the DVD all by itself.If you like fighting anime, this one is a must-have for your collection.",5,Possibly the Best God-Warrior movie yet.,1066867200,"10 23, 2003",2003,1695,"['quot', 'God-Warrior', 'quot', 'subgenre', 'anime', 'basically', 'teams', 'human', 'warriors', 'gifted', 'extraordinary', 'powers', 'who', 'are', 'chosen', 'fight', 'gods/demons', 'major', 'world-conquering', 'ambitions', 'original', 'God-Warrior', 'anime', 'generally', 'considered', 'be', 'Saint', 'Seiya', 'others', 'include', 'Yoroiden', 'Samurai', 'Troopers', 'quot', 'Ronin', 'Warriors', 'quot', 'Shurato', 'parodic', 'approach', 'Sailor', 'Moon.YuuYuu', 'Hakusho', 'broke', 'several', 'standard', 'tropes', 'starting', 'not', 'being', 'five-team', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'eliminating', 'special', 'costumes', 'Then', 'made', 'sure', 'be', 'distinct', 'making', 'characters', 'not-nice', 'people', 'nicest', 'one', 'Kuwabera', 'gang', 'leader', 'who', 'always', 'lived', 'life', 'fists', 'who', 'surprising', 'secret', 'heroic', 'streak', 'others', 'range', 'down', 'there', 'sarcastic', 'Yuske', 'fox-demon', 'Kurama', 'equal', 'demonic', 'Hiei', 'who', 'be', 'Vegita', '[', 'DBZ', ']', 'love', 'child', 'judging', 'appearances', 'coming', 'dead', 'last', 'quot', 'Guy', 'want', 'actually', 'MEET', 'quot', 'sweepstakes.Because', 'changes', 'YuuYuu', 'was', 'able', 'provide', 'plotlines', 'others', 'could', 'not', 'keeping', 'fresh', 'even', 'otherwise', 'followed', 'genre', 'conventions', 'letter', 'YuuYuu', 'Hakusho', 'movie', 'best', 'features', 'YuuYuu', 'Hakusho', 'including', 'characterizations', 'twists', 'plot', 'dramatic', 'battles', 'villains', 'are', 'actually', 'rather', 'inventive', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'anime', 'only', 'buttkicking', '_raison', ""d'etre_"", 'grand', 'finale', 'dark', 'god', 'king', 'Netherworld', 'Yakumo', 'price', 'DVD', 'itself.If', 'fighting', 'anime', 'one', 'must-have', 'collection']",Poltergeist Report VHS

I think the only thing was bad was the dubbed but it wasn't to bad.This is about the nether world and trying to take over the human world. I have to say the plots lines are very good. The fights are awesome, but at the end of Kuwabara's fight,well it ended alittle silly. People really can't say Kuwabara is stupid cause he proves us wrong so many times in the battle field. This is a must see for all who love Yu Yu Hakusho. Hiei and Kurama Fans will love the fight sense in this movie.If you have been watching the series you are already know about Kurama's past, but it shows alittle more than what you would think as he is now. All I can really say is Kurama is very loyal. Hiei, well we all know he has a bad past. One of the nether world's demonic legions is crupting Hiei's demon heart and ordering him to destroy his friends. Will he give in to the dark power and destroy Yusuke and the others? Well you'll be shock to see what happens here. One more thing Yukina is in here too. It seems also that Kawbara name is said wrong but don't worry it didn't bother me. If you are a true Yu Yu Hakusho Fan you will not worry about little things like that. Because in me personal opinion, if you worry about the dubbing, and then you can not truly be a ANIME fan. If the fights and the plots are good I see no ploblem. This movie is really great I totally suggest you to buy it.

183418,ABYNIQUEMDKY6,1562196367,Steve Miller,"[0, 9]","'Poltergeist Report' follows a group of young 'spirit investigators' as they become the last hope for the world when the Netherworld threatens to rise and take the place of the mortal world. Sounds pretty neat, I think.  Too bad the execution of 'Poltergeist Report' doesn't live up to its  promise.The film has two fatal flaws, both of which relate to its  script.First, the film assumes *way* too much knowledge on the part of  the viewers, namely that we are familiar with the comic book upon which it  is based. We are never properly introduced to the cast of characters--all  we learn is that they, for some reason, have 'spirit powers' are are in  league with the powers-that-be in the Spirit World. (For most of the film,  I thought they were somehow spirits that were walking the mortal world, but  toward the end, references seem to imply they are mortals.) We also never  learn what their relationships to each other are, and there's never even a  sliver of infomation provided about *why* these kids lead the dangerous  lives they do. The only one that makes a small amount of sense is the  Shrine Maiden, but that's because she's a stock character. Everyone else  remains total enigmas for the entire film, something which I assume is not  the case to anyone who's read the comic book. It would have been nice if  the unitiated could have been granted some insight, too. I suppose that if  that insight had been provided by the film, the title might even make  sense, too. ('Poltergeist Report'? What Poltergeist? What Report?  Huh?)Second, the film probably resembles too much the comic books upon  which it is based in its pacing and execution... which, judgeing by the  film, are probably quite awful. It's a string of fight scenes, with what  passes for the plot serving as an excuse to get from fight scene to fight  scene. And like all bad comic books, the fights seem completely  unmotivated. In fact, on more than one occassion, the heroes behave in a  mystifyingly stupid fashion just so the fight scene can take place. (I  imagine that if I understood why some of the characters behave the way they  do, *maybe* their behavior would make more sense. Somehow, I doubt it,  though.)There isn't much about 'Poltergeist Report' that I can be  positive about. It features average animation and average voice acting (  have the dubbed version). The near complete lack of craft present in the  screenplay, however, more than outweighs the average craftmanship in the  animation and voice acting.I advise taking a pass on this one... unless,  of course, you are a fan of the comic book series upon which it is based.

Well, what I drew from the movie overall was this:1. It was pretty good, like an hour and a half-long episode of Yu Yu Hakusho.2. The violence was kicked up a little from the FUNimation editted version I was used to.3. I really, really needed to either a. learn Japanese or b. get a better movieBut when I saw Poltergeist Report in Blockbuster, I read a review on Amazon before I rented. Turns out the producer decided the American dub-cast from the series wasn't good enough so they got a new cast. If I could quote from Ronska's title the dubbed voices were &quot;mediocracy at it's best&quot;.Yet another little thing I didn't like was they took the funny bits we'd get from relationship errors or maybe just Kuwabara doing something stupid. There was no Keiko/Yusuke fights. In fact, you only had two scene with Keiko: one where she's taking care of Boton, the other, she's only there for the villian to hurt and have Yusuke get pissed.Overall, not as good as the series, missing the funny bits, (but I must admit when Kuwabara hears that Yukina is at Genkei's place he looks and sounds funny!) and PLEASE watch subtitled.",3,"Okay, but then again...",1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,1259,"['Well', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'find', 'subtitled', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Much', 'disgust', 'subtitles', 'SUCKED', 'Well', 'what', 'drew', 'movie', 'overall', 'was', 'this:1', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'hour', 'half-long', 'episode', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho.2', 'violence', 'was', 'kicked', 'up', 'little', 'FUNimation', 'editted', 'version', 'was', 'used', 'to.3', 'really', 'really', 'needed', 'a.', 'learn', 'Japanese', 'b.', 'get', 'better', 'movieBut', 'when', 'saw', 'Poltergeist', 'Report', 'Blockbuster', 'read', 'review', 'Amazon', 'rented', 'out', 'producer', 'decided', 'American', 'dub-cast', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'got', 'new', 'cast', 'could', 'quote', 'Ronska', 'title', 'dubbed', 'voices', 'were', 'quot', 'mediocracy', 'best', 'quot', 'little', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'took', 'funny', 'bits', ""'d"", 'get', 'relationship', 'errors', 'maybe', 'just', 'Kuwabara', 'doing', 'something', 'stupid', 'was', 'Keiko/Yusuke', 'fights', 'fact', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'scene', 'Keiko', 'one', 'where', 'taking', 'care', 'Boton', 'other', 'only', 'there', 'villian', 'hurt', 'have', 'Yusuke', 'get', 'pissed.Overall', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'series', 'missing', 'funny', 'bits', 'must', 'admit', 'when', 'Kuwabara', 'Yukina', 'Genkei', 'place', 'funny', 'PLEASE', 'watch', 'subtitled']",Poltergeist Report VHS

For the past few months, randomly, I decided to re watch the whole series and the movies.Everybody is entitled to their own opinion but it's just hard for me to give this a rating higher that a 2 or 3. No way does it deserve a 4 or 5.Lets see what should we coverGraphics - decent DVD graphics. the movie is old, back in the 90's. It shouldn't be a problem though, graphics did not bother me at all.Storyline - pretty decent storyline. As I said, I am a huge fan. I'll watch anything Yu Yu Hakusho. The story was decent, ok, no problem with that at all.Voices - Basically, it boils down to this. Nothing else would bother me, I don't ask for much. After watching the english dubbed ""Yu Yu Hakusho movie"", I was hoping Poltergeist report wasn't as horrible with their character voices and acting. Ok, it wasn't AS BAD, but it was still pretty bad. I don't feel as though the acting or the voices reflect the characters rightful personalities at all. I don't know how this whole process works, but all those responsible for the english dubbed voices in this movie should be ashamed. Its a disgrace. I should have just watched it in Japanese with english subtitles. I'm really hoping that they re release this movie with better voice and acting. In my opinion this is what killed it. It's hardly even watchable.Final Opinion - So do I recommend you to watch this? Well there's so many people that doesn't seem to mind the voices and acting at all. Are they Yu Yu Hakusho fans I don't know. To me yeah, I would still watch it, because the visuals bring back memories from my childhood in the 90's.
