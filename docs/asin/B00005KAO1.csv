The ominous fortune bothers her, however, as its cryptic  message appears dark and foreboding. On her 16th birthday, after some strange circumstances, she's invited to a birthday party at her grandfather's home. Although her grandfather's home is filled with pleasant memories, something sinister awaits her there.In episode 2(Tenyo's First Kiss)The awful truth has been revealed, and Aya finds herself fighting for her life. Her father, in his attempt to save her, has paid a very dear price. During her flight, however, she encounters the mysterious boy who saved her in the street once again. With her grandfather's henchmen surrounding the estate, will she and her would-be savior escape.In episode 3(One who fell From the Heavens)Facing her rescuers, the truth is finally revealed to Aya. It seems that she's really a mystical Tenyo with psychic abilities at her disposal. This fact makes her very dangerous to the Mikage clan who are trying their hardest to dispose of her permanently.

661489,A2V026TK7H80V3,B00005KAO1,Carl Cheng,"[12, 13]","Viz releases Ceres, Celestial Legend (Ayashi no Ceres), by famed manga story and artist, Watase Yu!  There are 8 DVDs that will be released, 3 episodes each.Watase Yu is probably most famous for her first long running manga series spanning 18 volumes, Fushigi Yuugi (Mysterious Play).  All of the Fushigi Yuugi anime has finally been released here in America by Pioneer.  Ayashi no Ceres is a manga series that spans 14 volumes but only 24 animated episodes.  How they fit 14 volumes into 24 episodes will be interesting to see.Ayashi no Ceres is about faternal twins, Aya (girl) and Aki (guy) Mikage, who on their 16th birthday must accept their twisted fate that is in their bloodline.  Aya and Aki thought they both had a normal life but that all changed after Aya went with her friends to get her fortune told.  A prophecy of darkness and power that comes when the 16th star and mood come together.  When getting home, their parents retain a cold attitude telling them that they had to go to their grandfather's house the next day (their birthday).  Naively going, all their relatives dressed in black sat a long table with Aya and Aki at one end.  A wooden box is placed in front of them asking them to open it.  At first afraid, the two open it revealing a severed hand.  Suddenly, Aki gets all these scars over his body and goes unconscious.  Aya gets scared and starts to panic.  Her family starts to attack her.  The truth was that her family wants her killed.  Why?  You'll just have to find out about the secret of the Mikage family and about Aya's destiny with Ceres.This is a fairly new anime (2000) with really nice animation.  The animation is basically those of Fushigi Yuugi but with finer lines etc.  The Japanese voice actors are mostly new voice actors.  Watase Yu thought it would be a good idea because she thought it would be better not to go, &quot;Oh, he's so and so from so and so anime!&quot;The opening song is really nice, it's called Scarlet and is performed by Iwao Junko, the voice actress of Ceres.  It's a slow, smooth song.  The ending song is called ONE and features a rock beat.  The DVDs are said to feature picture galleries, intereviews and such so look out for good extras along with them.Final Note:  DVDs are awesome, and with all these recent animes on DVDs, I cannot wait to see the visual quality.  This is an amazing series.  Expect more twists and turns as can be expected from the stories that Watase Yu makes.  Fushigi Yuugi fans will not be disappointed.",5,Watase Yu Does it Again,990144000,"05 18, 2001",2001,2505,"['Viz', 'Ceres', 'Celestial', 'Legend', 'Ayashi', 'Ceres', 'famed', 'manga', 'story', 'artist', 'Watase', 'Yu', 'are', '8', 'DVDs', 'will', 'be', 'released', '3', 'episodes', 'each.Watase', 'Yu', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'first', 'long', 'running', 'manga', 'series', 'spanning', '18', 'volumes', 'Fushigi', 'Yuugi', 'Mysterious', 'Play', 'Fushigi', 'Yuugi', 'anime', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'here', 'America', 'Pioneer', 'Ayashi', 'Ceres', 'manga', 'series', '14', 'volumes', 'only', '24', 'animated', 'episodes', 'How', 'fit', '14', 'volumes', '24', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see.Ayashi', 'Ceres', 'faternal', 'twins', 'Aya', 'girl', 'Aki', 'guy', 'Mikage', 'who', '16th', 'birthday', 'must', 'accept', 'twisted', 'fate', 'bloodline', 'Aya', 'Aki', 'thought', 'had', 'normal', 'life', 'changed', 'Aya', 'went', 'friends', 'get', 'fortune', 'told', 'A', 'prophecy', 'darkness', 'power', 'when', '16th', 'star', 'mood', 'come', 'together', 'When', 'getting', 'home', 'parents', 'retain', 'cold', 'attitude', 'telling', 'had', 'go', 'grandfather', 'house', 'next', 'day', 'birthday', 'Naively', 'going', 'relatives', 'dressed', 'black', 'sat', 'long', 'table', 'Aya', 'Aki', 'one', 'end', 'wooden', 'box', 'placed', 'front', 'asking', 'open', 'first', 'afraid', 'two', 'open', 'revealing', 'severed', 'hand', 'Suddenly', 'Aki', 'scars', 'body', 'unconscious', 'Aya', 'scared', 'panic', 'family', 'attack', 'truth', 'was', 'family', 'killed', 'Why', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'secret', 'Mikage', 'family', 'Aya', 'destiny', 'Ceres.This', 'fairly', 'new', 'anime', '2000', 'really', 'nice', 'animation', 'animation', 'basically', 'Fushigi', 'Yuugi', 'finer', 'lines', 'etc', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'mostly', 'new', 'voice', 'actors', 'Watase', 'Yu', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'not', 'go', 'quot', 'Oh', 'so', 'so', 'so', 'so', 'anime', 'quot', 'opening', 'song', 'really', 'nice', 'called', 'Scarlet', 'performed', 'Iwao', 'Junko', 'voice', 'actress', 'Ceres', 'slow', 'smooth', 'song', 'ending', 'song', 'called', 'ONE', 'rock', 'beat', 'DVDs', 'are', 'said', 'feature', 'picture', 'galleries', 'intereviews', 'such', 'so', 'look', 'out', 'good', 'extras', 'them.Final', 'Note', 'DVDs', 'are', 'awesome', 'recent', 'animes', 'DVDs', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'visual', 'quality', 'amazing', 'series', 'Expect', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'stories', 'Watase', 'Yu', 'Fushigi', 'Yuugi', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

There's some neat extra's on here, including a short interview with Yu Watase herself about how she feels about the support of her fans.  There's also a nice character profile on here, along with a clip of Yu Watase drawing.  You have the option of English or Japanese audio with subtitles.  &quot;Scarlet&quot; the opening song, is sooooo gorgeous, I just wish that it had the translation on there since it has a text-less opening and ending, the only down side.

Aki is struck with serious pain and bleeding. His sister, Aya, is frantic and confused. Her grandfather tells her that her brother is very important to the Mikage family, but she must be killed. Aya is able to escape. She learns that she is descended from an angel. Things have become very complicated. Now she is on the run, trying to discover her powers, stay alive, and find her brother.This anime has some good and bad points. The story has potential. For some reason, it seems awkward and doesn't flow well. For an older series, the animation is pretty good. I'm not a fan of the animation style where even the guys look like girls. That's what you get with this anime. The voice acting is pretty bad. I haven't  listened to the Japanese audio, but I don't think that I enjoyed the story enough to bother. I realize that this series is just getting started. There are only 3 episodes in this volume. It takes longer than that to get into most shows, but I don't have a strong inclination to continue watching.Weighing the good and bad, and trying to be objective; I think this deserves 3 stars.

Ceres wants to destroy the Mikage, so the Mikage want to destroy Ceres (who is sharing a body with Aya) first. Ceres especially wants to kill Aya's twin brother Aki. This results in a lot of trouble and heartache, then add Aya falling in love with Toya (who works for the Mikage) and Yuuhi (who's sister helps Aya) falling in love with Aya.....My thoughts: Very different from Fushigi Yugi, Yu Watase's other popular work, which is funny and for the most part light hearted. Ceres is somewhat dark and it's dramatic. My mini-plot doesn't really do it justice, there's a lot that goes on in Ceres, I had to know what happens next and couldn't stop watching it (I have an imported boxed set). If only Yuuhi were real, I'd marry him in a second! I recommend watching the dubbed first so it's easier to pay attention to plot and animation, and then watch the subbed to get a real feel for the emotion of the show. There is just something about the Japanese language that expresses emotion better than English. Toya's Japanese voice seems to fit him better, while Yuuhi's English voice seems to fit better. The music is very good, recycled a lot, but very good.Not for kids, I would say at least 13 and up.

All hail her..This is Watase at her best, and Studio Peirrot brings her story great honor (especially since they successfully condensed a 14 volume manga into a 26 episode tv series). The animation style is much like that of Fushigi Yuugi (if you're familiar with that series, you know what I mean), based on the fact that the bishounen (gorgeous &quot;pretty&quot; boys) of the series look remarkably like those of FY. But in Ayashi no Ceres (Celestial Legend to us) the animation &quot;quality&quot; is much nicer and more outstanding. The storyline is more mature, violent, and graphic than that of FY, and the overall mood is much darker. An extremely compelling series!If you're familiar of the story of the tennou (nymph) bound to earth because of her stolen hagoromo (robe), then Ayashi no Ceres is right up your alley because that is what it is based on. If you do not know the story, it is a very famous legend told in Asia and around the world about a nymph who's robe was stolen by a man. The loss of this robe meant that she could not return to heaven. She marries the very man who had stolen her robe, and bears him children, although eventually (according to Ayashi no Ceres' version) she returns to heaven declaring that every generation she will return to seek her revenge on the one who had taken her robe. In Ayashi no Ceres, the chosen one of the present generation is Aya, the main character.The story starts out right away, and soon becomes so complex that it grips your mind as well as you heart. Having some of the same themes as Fushigi Yuugi (i.e. two people who once were so close are torn apart because of destiny, as well as romantic triangles), Ayashi no Ceres not only succeeds as a outstanding anime, it also far exceeds any storyline that you could see in many anime now-a-days...",5,By The Creator of Fushigi Yuugi...

But I have to say, first off, I HATE AYA'S DUBBED VOICE! Because I am understanding about the lack of decent English seiyuus, I try to over look it, but I can't help wondering why they didn't release a subtitled version. Afterall, no one wants to miss out on Iwao Junko's beautiful voice playing Ceres. So, another thing that bugs me is that Aya's personality is very different in the anime than in the manga. In the anime she often comes out as a whiney girl. In the manga, she's more playful. Then there is the fact that they pronounce the name 'Ceres' as 'sAIR-iss'. Everyone know that the name for the Roman goddess of the harvest is pronounced 'seer-eez' sounding like the word 'series'. (Note: The name for the Roman goddess of the harvest and plants is the derivitive for the word 'cereal', you know, like those Cheerios you eat every morning. Think about that.) The last thing that bothers me about the anime is the way the main characters like Shuro and Kei have such a minor role. It's too bad, because Shuro is a really cool character. Other than that, the anime is funny, interesting and cool. It's more dramatic than the more light hearted Fushigi Yuugi, but the story is quite touching.

Aya Mikage and her twin brother Aki have been invited to what they think is a party at their grandfather's sprawling mansion but is really something more sinister. The two are set before a table surrounded by family and some guys that look like the agents from The Matrix and Aya is asked to open a box. Inside is a stone hand which shatters when she looks at it as beside her, Aki begins to scream and become covered in bleeding cuts as if being sliced by an invisible knife! Somehow, the whole ritual was a sort of test to help the family make a decision to kill her and her father is given the gun to shoot her in the head! What the flip is wrong with these people??!! Aya will have to find out what mysterious being resides within her that allows her to harness divine powers if she hopes to survive the murderous intentions of her own family!Even though this first volume was too brief, (it only had 3 episodes), I kinda liked that format, because it helps build the suspense. To me, the plot is pretty dramatic and intense. How could it not be, seeing as how two of the people that want to kill Aya are her own mother and father? This going against the laws of nature angle gives Ceres a real edge and potential to touch on pretty big themes. This helped me get over the pretty boy character designs that are obviously there to get girl's juices flowing. One minor annoyance that I've noticed in Watase's manga work is the terrible sense of comic timing she has. In some of her most serious scenes, she has the unfortunate habit of ruining it with slapstick humor, almost as if she is afraid of the dramatic extreme of human sadness or tragedy. There is a tinge of that on this first volume so I hope the anime writers keep it to a minimum. A good first volume.",4,A BAD BIRTHDAY,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,1897,"['just', 'something', 'girl', 'turning', '16', 'Japan', 'just', 'tragic', 'fate', 'days', 'Witness', 'Scrapped', 'Princess', 'Aya', 'Mikage', 'twin', 'brother', 'Aki', 'have', 'been', 'invited', 'what', 'think', 'party', 'grandfather', 'sprawling', 'mansion', 'really', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'two', 'are', 'set', 'table', 'surrounded', 'family', 'guys', 'look', 'agents', 'Matrix', 'Aya', 'asked', 'open', 'box', 'Inside', 'stone', 'hand', 'shatters', 'when', 'Aki', 'scream', 'become', 'covered', 'bleeding', 'cuts', 'being', 'sliced', 'invisible', 'knife', 'Somehow', 'whole', 'ritual', 'was', 'sort', 'test', 'help', 'family', 'make', 'decision', 'kill', 'father', 'given', 'gun', 'shoot', 'head', 'What', 'flip', 'wrong', 'people', 'Aya', 'will', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'mysterious', 'being', 'resides', 'harness', 'divine', 'powers', 'survive', 'murderous', 'intentions', 'own', 'family', 'Even', 'first', 'volume', 'was', 'too', 'brief', 'only', 'had', '3', 'episodes', 'kinda', 'liked', 'format', 'build', 'suspense', 'plot', 'pretty', 'dramatic', 'intense', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'seeing', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'want', 'kill', 'Aya', 'are', 'own', 'mother', 'father', 'going', 'laws', 'nature', 'angle', 'real', 'edge', 'potential', 'touch', 'pretty', 'big', 'themes', 'helped', 'get', 'pretty', 'boy', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'obviously', 'there', 'get', 'girl', 'juices', 'flowing', 'One', 'minor', 'annoyance', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'Watase', 'manga', 'work', 'terrible', 'sense', 'comic', 'timing', 'most', 'serious', 'scenes', 'unfortunate', 'habit', 'ruining', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'almost', 'afraid', 'dramatic', 'extreme', 'human', 'sadness', 'tragedy', 'tinge', 'first', 'volume', 'so', 'hope', 'anime', 'writers', 'keep', 'minimum', 'good', 'first', 'volume']",N/A

Korsunsky ""yuirain""","[0, 0]","The series are very pretty,(all the guys are really cute!) however all fushigi yuugi fans be ware - this series are rather dark, definitely not appropriate for children under 13. Aya(main character) seems less of a klutz as Miaka was, probably because her ""other self"" is one ... off goddess!(or celestial spirit):)  The dvd looks very elegant, the inside insert is actually a mini *poster*! Extras include interview with creator of the ""Ceres"", also there are profiles for each character with black and white sketches. - definitely read those first, it will be much easier to watch a movie. Also, when you get the dvd there is an insert that asks if u want to sign up for ""Ceres"" manga (comics) (1 year subscription),this way you will get much more info on the series. Oh and dont be afraid to get hooked on it and become totally broke - this series are not that long (esp. comparing to FYuugi or SMoon) :)",5,Great new series,997401600,"08 10, 2001",2001,907,"['series', 'are', 'very', 'pretty', 'guys', 'are', 'really', 'cute', 'however', 'fushigi', 'yuugi', 'fans', 'be', 'ware', 'series', 'are', 'rather', 'dark', 'definitely', 'not', 'appropriate', 'children', '13', 'Aya', 'main', 'character', 'less', 'klutz', 'Miaka', 'was', 'probably', 'other', 'self', 'one', 'goddess', 'celestial', 'spirit', 'dvd', 'very', 'elegant', 'inside', 'insert', 'actually', 'mini', '*poster*', 'Extras', 'include', 'interview', 'creator', 'Ceres', 'also', 'are', 'profiles', 'character', 'black', 'white', 'sketches', 'definitely', 'read', 'first', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'easier', 'watch', 'movie', 'Also', 'when', 'get', 'dvd', 'insert', 'u', 'want', 'sign', 'up', 'Ceres', 'manga', 'comics', '1', 'year', 'subscription', 'way', 'will', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'info', 'series', 'Oh', 'dont', 'be', 'afraid', 'get', 'hooked', 'become', 'totally', 'broke', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'long', 'esp', 'comparing', 'FYuugi', 'SMoon']",N/A
