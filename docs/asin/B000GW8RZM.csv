It's a subtle difference in some parts but if you're like me , it matters because we want both.. Can you imagine having the energy to be filming her first movie and asked permission from the directors / producers to do this in Central Park.. Dresses by Irene Shariff, who did Funny Girl ....she didn't have to worry about singing in the movie as most were prerecorded.. I remember all the huff the press put out when Streisand was recording ""People"".. Even though she'd done this musical via Broadway, the arrangements in the movie were redone , very clean and beautifully sung .. I still like both the stage version/ movie because of the stage version is very raw/ songs missing that were left out of the movie.. I digress from Central Park.

Her voice soared with thrilling ease and she almost made every song she sang, her own.  There's no quibbling with what's here -- it's all great.  But, they didn't just shut off the cameras for the songs that are not included on both the alblum (now CD) and the special which aired on CBS (an hour-long affair, which features about 50 minutes of music).That material remains locked away in the vaults and there's no excuse for not putting it out there now.Yes, we all know that she flubbed the words on 2 or 3 songs...fine ...whatever.  Wow, Barbra is human!  It actually makes her more interesting than ever.  That such things put her into a panic and had her shy away from live performances for over 20 years makes having the full version of this released all the more important!Anyway, go to the vaults, dig that stuff out and put out the definitive records of what she did back on that night in 1967 in Central Park.

1007728,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000GW8RZM,Ed Uyeshima,"[11, 11]","Barbra Streisand took a weekend break from filming her screen debut, ""Funny Girl"", to come back to New York to give a free concert for over 135,000 attentive fans. Unlikely ever to happen again given the top dollar she is charging for her upcoming tour, the June 1967 performance was staged in Central Park's Sheep Meadow, probably among the first of the city's ""happenings"" led by then-Mayor Lindsay to encourage an urban revival. Always the trendsetter, Streisand led the way for others including Diana Ross, the Dave Matthews Band and the reunited Simon and Garfunkel to stage their own happenings in later years. I'm happy to report that the restoration effort behind the audio and visual quality of this TV special is quite stellar.But nothing is more stellar than Streisand in her youthful, exuberant prime. The camera pans from the Manhattan skyline to the assembled crowd and finally her over ""The Nearness of You"". Looking particularly diaphanous in a pink sheath, she does a smashing ""Down With Love"", a highly theatrical ""Cry Me a River"", and one of her typically eccentric monologues from the sixties followed by one of my favorites among her rarities, ""Value"" (a ditty about Harold Mengert and his car). She ends the first act with a soaring rendition of ""I Can See It"". It's particularly amusing to see random shots of adoring spectators looking very much like sixties squares from Squaresville.Returning for the second half in a sleeveless red print evening gown, Streisand evokes a sweet innocence to her classic version of ""He Touched Me"", which is then followed by an extended comedy bit about ""a schloon for the gumpert"". She swings into a languorous ""I'm All Smiles"" and then segues into a comic beatnik number, ""Marty the Martian"" (""hand in hand in hand in hand...""), accompanied by a sassy saxophone. The high point is a beautiful folk-sounding ballad, ""Natural Sounds"", in particular, when the wind picks up exactly when she mentions the wind in the song (an eerie coincidence Streisand points out in her 1987 video introduction). She gets amusingly hammy on her signature ""Second Hand Rose"" and then quite stentorian on her anthem, ""People"".The climax comes with a strangely appropriate ""Silent Night"" (it was summer). With the camera dramatically panning back from her, Streisand ends the performance with a splendiferous ""Happy Days Are Here Again"". Because it was so darkly lit among the throngs, it's hard to fathom the real size of the audience in the days until the very end of the show. My one regret with the DVD is that there seems to be a missed opportunity to include the entire concert, which included eleven other songs she performed that night. Even though the archival footage apparently exists, I'm just happy they have been able to capture what was quite obviously a special evening.",5,A Happening in the True Sense of the Term...Streisand Captured in Her Youthful Performing Prime,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,2824,"['Barbra', 'Streisand', 'took', 'weekend', 'break', 'filming', 'screen', 'debut', 'Funny', 'Girl', 'come', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'give', 'free', 'concert', '135,000', 'attentive', 'fans', 'Unlikely', 'ever', 'happen', 'again', 'given', 'top', 'dollar', 'charging', 'upcoming', 'tour', 'June', '1967', 'performance', 'was', 'staged', 'Central', 'Park', 'Sheep', 'Meadow', 'probably', 'first', 'city', 'happenings', 'led', 'then-Mayor', 'Lindsay', 'encourage', 'urban', 'revival', 'trendsetter', 'Streisand', 'led', 'way', 'others', 'including', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'Band', 'reunited', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'stage', 'own', 'happenings', 'later', 'years', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'restoration', 'effort', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'TV', 'special', 'quite', 'stellar.But', 'nothing', 'more', 'stellar', 'Streisand', 'youthful', 'exuberant', 'prime', 'camera', 'Manhattan', 'skyline', 'assembled', 'crowd', 'finally', 'Nearness', 'Looking', 'particularly', 'diaphanous', 'pink', 'sheath', 'smashing', 'Love', 'highly', 'theatrical', 'Cry', 'Me', 'River', 'one', 'typically', 'eccentric', 'monologues', 'sixties', 'followed', 'one', 'favorites', 'rarities', 'Value', 'ditty', 'Harold', 'Mengert', 'car', 'first', 'act', 'soaring', 'rendition', 'Can', 'See', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'see', 'random', 'shots', 'adoring', 'spectators', 'looking', 'very', 'much', 'sixties', 'squares', 'Squaresville.Returning', 'second', 'half', 'sleeveless', 'red', 'print', 'evening', 'gown', 'Streisand', 'sweet', 'innocence', 'classic', 'version', 'Touched', 'Me', 'then', 'followed', 'extended', 'comedy', 'bit', 'schloon', 'gumpert', 'swings', 'languorous', ""'m"", 'Smiles', 'then', 'segues', 'comic', 'beatnik', 'number', 'Marty', 'Martian', 'hand', 'hand', 'hand', 'hand', 'accompanied', 'sassy', 'saxophone', 'high', 'point', 'beautiful', 'folk-sounding', 'ballad', 'Natural', 'Sounds', 'particular', 'when', 'wind', 'up', 'exactly', 'when', 'wind', 'song', 'eerie', 'coincidence', 'Streisand', 'out', '1987', 'video', 'introduction', 'amusingly', 'hammy', 'signature', 'Second', 'Hand', 'Rose', 'then', 'quite', 'stentorian', 'anthem', 'People', '.The', 'climax', 'strangely', 'appropriate', 'Silent', 'Night', 'was', 'summer', 'camera', 'dramatically', 'panning', 'back', 'Streisand', 'performance', 'splendiferous', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Are', 'Here', 'Again', 'was', 'so', 'darkly', 'lit', 'throngs', 'hard', 'fathom', 'real', 'size', 'audience', 'days', 'very', 'end', 'show', 'one', 'regret', 'DVD', 'be', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'include', 'entire', 'concert', 'included', 'eleven', 'other', 'songs', 'performed', 'night', 'Even', 'archival', 'footage', 'apparently', ""'m"", 'just', 'happy', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'capture', 'what', 'was', 'quite', 'obviously', 'special', 'evening']",N/A

I was given it as a gift in 1968 which was a vinyl back then but as time went on you began to hear the cracks and bumps so it was time to get the CD which brought back the clarity. A Happening in Central Park was made after Barbara Streisand made Funny Girl it's amazing this concert was made in Central Park on a perfect night with no rain and no violence. The songs are great with a live audience that gives back their hart warming feed back. I also have the DVD to this CD which is great to have so you can see and hear the concert.

1007731,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000GW8RZM,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[3, 3]","On June 17, 1968 Barbra Streisand recorded her first live album called ""A Happening In Central Park"". Wisely, this amazing event was recorded for the cameras as well and aired as her third TV special for CBS. While on a break from filming her first feature film ""Funny Girl"" Barbra filmed the special before an audience of 135,000 people in New York City. Other performers would follow in Streisand's shoes like Diana Ross and Garth Brooks, but this was a one-of-a-kind concert for many reasons: first, this would lead Barbra to not performing live for the next twenty years as she suffered severe stage freight (you can actually see the fear in her eyes when she forgets some of the lyrics), and secondly for TV audiences who had never seen a Streisand concert this was a special treat.Highlights include Barbra standards like ""People"", ""Happy Days Are Here Again"", and ""Second Hand Rose"". Probably the most unlikely song Barbra sang on this hot June evening was ""Silent Night"", mostly known as a Christmas standard, but done the only way Streisand knew how to do it: she wanted there to be peace in America during the time as the U.S. was embroiled in the Vietnam War.This concert is available as a stand alone disc or as part of the fabulous Barbra box set ""The Television Specials"" that feature all five of her TV landmark broadcasts.",5,"""Barbra At Her Peak""",1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,1338,"['June', '17', '1968', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'recorded', 'first', 'live', 'album', 'called', 'Happening', 'Central', 'Park', 'Wisely', 'amazing', 'event', 'was', 'recorded', 'cameras', 'well', 'aired', 'third', 'TV', 'special', 'CBS', 'break', 'filming', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Funny', 'Girl', 'Barbra', 'filmed', 'special', 'audience', '135,000', 'people', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Other', 'performers', 'would', 'follow', 'Streisand', 'shoes', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Garth', 'Brooks', 'was', 'one-of-a-kind', 'concert', 'many', 'reasons', 'first', 'would', 'lead', 'Barbra', 'not', 'performing', 'live', 'next', 'twenty', 'years', 'suffered', 'severe', 'stage', 'freight', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'fear', 'eyes', 'when', 'lyrics', 'secondly', 'TV', 'audiences', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Streisand', 'concert', 'was', 'special', 'treat.Highlights', 'include', 'Barbra', 'standards', 'People', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Are', 'Here', 'Again', 'Second', 'Hand', 'Rose', 'Probably', 'most', 'unlikely', 'song', 'Barbra', 'sang', 'hot', 'June', 'evening', 'was', 'Silent', 'Night', 'mostly', 'known', 'Christmas', 'standard', 'done', 'only', 'way', 'Streisand', 'knew', 'how', 'do', 'wanted', 'be', 'peace', 'America', 'time', 'U.S.', 'was', 'embroiled', 'Vietnam', 'War.This', 'concert', 'available', 'stand', 'alone', 'part', 'fabulous', 'Barbra', 'box', 'set', 'Television', 'Specials', 'feature', 'five', 'TV', 'landmark', 'broadcasts']",N/A
