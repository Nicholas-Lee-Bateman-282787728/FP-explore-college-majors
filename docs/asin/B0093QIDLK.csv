Frank had suffered an almost fatal injury (severing his urethra after falling into his pool when his chair slide into it) and was barely able to make this show. In retrospect he feels he would have been better served competing the following year.I also enjoyed seeing the other competitors and the interactions among Tom Platz, Samir Bannout, Dennis Tinnerino etc, and the footage with Tom Platz is also very interesting. Though I never really liked Tom's physique (awesome legs but unfortunately they were so spectacular it messed up his overall symmetry, but this is a personal opinion), I have tremendous respect for the intensity he brought to the 'sport'Anyway, if you are a fan of Bodybuilding you'll probably enjoy this as a slice of time captured of a past era!",5,Interesting Look At A Controversial Mr. Olympia!,1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,977,"['Interesting', 'look', 'perhaps', 'most', 'controversial', 'Mr.', 'Olympia', 'ever', 'Personally', 'was', 'mostly', 'interested', 'seeing', 'footage', 'Frank', 'Zane', 'documentary', 'favorite', 'bodybuilder', 'time', 'Frank', 'had', 'suffered', 'almost', 'fatal', 'injury', 'severing', 'urethra', 'falling', 'pool', 'when', 'chair', 'slide', 'was', 'barely', 'able', 'make', 'show', 'retrospect', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'competing', 'following', 'year.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'other', 'competitors', 'interactions', 'Tom', 'Platz', 'Samir', 'Bannout', 'Dennis', 'Tinnerino', 'etc', 'footage', 'Tom', 'Platz', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'Tom', 'physique', 'awesome', 'legs', 'unfortunately', 'were', 'so', 'spectacular', 'messed', 'up', 'overall', 'symmetry', 'personal', 'opinion', 'have', 'tremendous', 'respect', 'intensity', 'brought', ""'sport'Anyway"", 'are', 'fan', 'Bodybuilding', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'slice', 'time', 'captured', 'past', 'era']",Arnold Schwarzenegger// The Comeback

It was not as good as ""Pumping Iron"". It should of had more extras on this DVD about Body Building.
