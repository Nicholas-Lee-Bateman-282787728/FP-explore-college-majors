348912,A1XKI53W1E891T,6302973570,Amy,"[3, 3]","Un Coeur en Hiver is a film about the deepest human feelings and fears, especially fear of intimacy and fear of rejection. The film is the story of three people. Maxime and Stephane are long time professional associates who operate a small company which constructs and restores violins. Maxime runs the business end of the operation, and Stephane is an expert craftsman who handles the repairs. One day, Maxime informs Stephane that he has met somebody. A woman named Camille, a beautiful and talented violinist. Maxime explains that he and Camille have fallen in love and are planning to live together, but as Stephane and Camille begin spending time together in their professional capacities, it becomes clear that they are attracted to each other. Yet, for some reason Stephane refuses to act on his feelings further confusing Camille. To her, he is an enigma. Eventually, she asks him, ""Why are you hiding from me?"" Stephane, meanwhile, can only further distance himself from her. Eventually,Camille reveals to Stephane that she wants him, and can accept the fact that he lives in an enclosed world. Stephane replies that she misunderstands him. He cruelly tells her that he has wanted to seduce her, without loving her, and that he listens to her play her violin only because it is his job. Stephane, of course, is covering his true feelings. At first, this seems self destructive, as he is throwing away any chance for the involvement he desires with Camille. His remarks deeply hurt Camille, and, ultimately, she ends up settling for Maxime. At the end of the film, Stephane, Camille and Maxime meet in a cafe. As Camille and Maxime start to walk away there is a look of sadness on Camille's face. As Stephane is left alone, he too shares that look, but he remains unable to express his emotions and share his life with someone else. In his mind, his rejection of Camille is an act of self preservation.In the beginning of Un Coeur en Hiver, it is observed that violins are the most precious possessions of violinists. This declaration has profound meaning as the scenario evolves. If the instruments are such, they are so because they are safe. They have no free will. They will never abandon their owners. If they fall apart from usage, they always can be repaired. They are dependable and reliable, unlike human beings. Even when two people connect, relations between them are inevitably less than harmonious. Emotions are complex and ever changing in human relationships, feelings are dependent upon the responses of others. Stephane is keenly aware of all this, and it is for this reason that despite his feelings, he distances himself from Camille. He is afraid of allowing himself to love her because of the pain he may be forced to endure. As a result, he presents himself as passionless, which even plays itself out during an intellectual discussion in which he professes to have no opinion on the subject at all.In the end, Stephane is a lonely figure, one who is unconnected with life. His solitude shelters him, keeping him protected from the hurt feelings that are the offshoots of human connection. Every time I watch this movie I wonder is he better or worse off. While we all are solitary souls, if we do not choose to be brave and risk connecting emotionally with others, our lives can never be complete. This is one of my favorite movies and the beautiful music of Ravel played through the film compliments the somber aura of the story.",5,"Un Coeur en Hiver is a beautiful, sensitive film",1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3461,"['Un', 'Coeur', 'en', 'Hiver', 'film', 'deepest', 'human', 'feelings', 'fears', 'especially', 'fear', 'intimacy', 'fear', 'rejection', 'film', 'story', 'three', 'people', 'Maxime', 'Stephane', 'are', 'long', 'time', 'professional', 'associates', 'who', 'operate', 'small', 'company', 'constructs', 'restores', 'violins', 'Maxime', 'business', 'end', 'operation', 'Stephane', 'expert', 'craftsman', 'who', 'repairs', 'One', 'day', 'Maxime', 'Stephane', 'met', 'somebody', 'woman', 'named', 'Camille', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'violinist', 'Maxime', 'Camille', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'are', 'planning', 'live', 'together', 'Stephane', 'Camille', 'begin', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'professional', 'capacities', 'clear', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'reason', 'Stephane', 'act', 'feelings', 'further', 'confusing', 'Camille', 'enigma', 'Eventually', 'Why', 'are', 'hiding', 'Stephane', 'meanwhile', 'can', 'only', 'further', 'distance', 'Eventually', 'Camille', 'Stephane', 'can', 'accept', 'fact', 'enclosed', 'world', 'Stephane', 'replies', 'cruelly', 'wanted', 'seduce', 'loving', 'play', 'violin', 'only', 'job', 'Stephane', 'course', 'covering', 'true', 'feelings', 'first', 'self', 'destructive', 'throwing', 'away', 'chance', 'involvement', 'Camille', 'remarks', 'deeply', 'hurt', 'Camille', 'ultimately', 'up', 'settling', 'Maxime', 'end', 'film', 'Stephane', 'Camille', 'Maxime', 'meet', 'cafe', 'Camille', 'Maxime', 'start', 'walk', 'away', 'look', 'sadness', 'Camille', 'face', 'Stephane', 'left', 'alone', 'too', 'shares', 'look', 'unable', 'express', 'emotions', 'share', 'life', 'someone', 'else', 'mind', 'rejection', 'Camille', 'act', 'self', 'beginning', 'Un', 'Coeur', 'en', 'Hiver', 'observed', 'violins', 'are', 'most', 'precious', 'possessions', 'violinists', 'declaration', 'profound', 'meaning', 'scenario', 'instruments', 'are', 'such', 'are', 'so', 'are', 'safe', 'have', 'free', 'will', 'will', 'never', 'abandon', 'owners', 'fall', 'apart', 'usage', 'always', 'can', 'be', 'repaired', 'are', 'dependable', 'reliable', 'human', 'beings', 'Even', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'connect', 'relations', 'are', 'inevitably', 'less', 'harmonious', 'Emotions', 'are', 'complex', 'ever', 'changing', 'human', 'relationships', 'feelings', 'are', 'dependent', 'responses', 'others', 'Stephane', 'keenly', 'aware', 'reason', 'feelings', 'Camille', 'afraid', 'allowing', 'love', 'pain', 'may', 'be', 'forced', 'endure', 'result', 'passionless', 'even', 'out', 'intellectual', 'discussion', 'have', 'opinion', 'subject', 'end', 'Stephane', 'lonely', 'figure', 'one', 'who', 'unconnected', 'life', 'solitude', 'shelters', 'keeping', 'protected', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'are', 'offshoots', 'human', 'connection', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'wonder', 'better', 'worse', 'off', 'are', 'solitary', 'souls', 'do', 'not', 'choose', 'be', 'brave', 'risk', 'connecting', 'emotionally', 'others', 'lives', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'complete', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Ravel', 'played', 'film', 'somber', 'aura', 'story']",Un Coeur En Hiver VHS

348914,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302973570,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Some films can be summed up as reactionary pieces; films that don't so much as progress as they do dwell in a moment and react to surrounding developments.  `Un Coeur en Hiver' is that kind of film.  It sits in its own little pocket and stirs the pot so-to-speak, not truly advancing forward but somewhat developing themes out of quiet and calculated momentum.  It is a film that I think could easily be dismissed because it doesn't wholly engage in a way that most would expect it to.  It doesn't shout at us but more or less whispers to the audience.Silence is golden.There are many films that attempt to uncover the tricky and almost bi-polar quality of love, using it as a springboard to delve into the heart of individuals.  For me, `Un Coeur en Hiver' is one of the more successful at this because it doesn't stoop to clich&eacute;d theatrics but instead finds more subtle and realistic ways to embellish the realities of love.In the film we are introduced to four people; Stephane, Maxime, Camille and Regine.  All of these people are in love with someone else and all of them have to share that love with another.  Some of it is passionate love, some of it is more paternal or even familial and then some of it is confused to the core; an indescribable and sadly undeniable feeling in the pit of one's stomach.  As Maxime risks losing all (his wife in particular) for the love of the beautiful violinist Camille, his business partner Stephane tries to dismiss his fondness for Camille.  As Camille begins to flirt with the idea of abandoning Maxime for Stephane, Regine finds this notion distasteful and ultimately disastrous and Stephane discovers that his affections for Camille could be misdirected affections for another person altogether.  As it all unravels (in superbly constructed segments of calm and naturalism instead of the expected melodrama) the audience is brought into this story and we are helped to understand the conundrum love presents all parties involved.In using the act of violin making and playing as a core theme all its own, `Un Coeur en Hiver' speaks volumes about the way we react to love in general, as if it were an instrument to try and or `test out' before devoting ourselves to it, and the notion that it can be tinkered with, fine-tuned and `fixed' carries serious weight throughout the development of the film's key themes.The acting is flawless (Beart, Auteuil, Dussollier and especially Catillon all as poised and natural as needed to convey such human drama) and the technical aspects of this film (the music, the lighting) are all top notch.  Director Claude Sautet takes us on a beautifully organic ride through the perils of love and leaves us contemplating just how authentic our own passions are.",5,Who do you love?,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,2748,"['films', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'reactionary', 'pieces', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'progress', 'do', 'dwell', 'moment', 'react', 'surrounding', 'developments', 'Un', 'Coeur', 'en', 'Hiver', 'kind', 'film', 'own', 'little', 'pocket', 'pot', 'so-to-speak', 'not', 'truly', 'advancing', 'forward', 'somewhat', 'developing', 'themes', 'quiet', 'calculated', 'momentum', 'film', 'think', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'dismissed', ""n't"", 'wholly', 'engage', 'way', 'most', 'would', 'expect', ""n't"", 'shout', 'more', 'less', 'whispers', 'audience.Silence', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'attempt', 'uncover', 'tricky', 'almost', 'bi-polar', 'quality', 'love', 'using', 'springboard', 'delve', 'heart', 'individuals', 'Un', 'Coeur', 'en', 'Hiver', 'one', 'more', 'successful', ""n't"", 'stoop', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'theatrics', 'instead', 'more', 'subtle', 'realistic', 'ways', 'embellish', 'realities', 'love.In', 'film', 'are', 'introduced', 'four', 'people', 'Stephane', 'Maxime', 'Camille', 'Regine', 'people', 'are', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'have', 'share', 'love', 'passionate', 'love', 'more', 'paternal', 'even', 'familial', 'then', 'confused', 'core', 'indescribable', 'sadly', 'undeniable', 'feeling', 'pit', 'one', 'stomach', 'Maxime', 'risks', 'losing', 'wife', 'particular', 'love', 'beautiful', 'violinist', 'Camille', 'business', 'partner', 'Stephane', 'dismiss', 'fondness', 'Camille', 'Camille', 'flirt', 'idea', 'abandoning', 'Maxime', 'Stephane', 'Regine', 'notion', 'distasteful', 'ultimately', 'disastrous', 'Stephane', 'discovers', 'affections', 'Camille', 'could', 'be', 'misdirected', 'affections', 'person', 'altogether', 'unravels', 'superbly', 'constructed', 'segments', 'calm', 'naturalism', 'instead', 'expected', 'melodrama', 'audience', 'brought', 'story', 'are', 'helped', 'understand', 'conundrum', 'love', 'parties', 'involved.In', 'using', 'act', 'violin', 'making', 'playing', 'core', 'theme', 'own', 'Un', 'Coeur', 'en', 'Hiver', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'way', 'react', 'love', 'general', 'were', 'instrument', 'try', 'test', 'devoting', 'notion', 'can', 'be', 'tinkered', 'fine-tuned', 'fixed', 'serious', 'weight', 'development', 'film', 'key', 'themes.The', 'acting', 'flawless', 'Beart', 'Auteuil', 'Dussollier', 'especially', 'Catillon', 'all', 'poised', 'natural', 'needed', 'convey', 'such', 'human', 'drama', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'music', 'lighting', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Director', 'Claude', 'Sautet', 'beautifully', 'organic', 'ride', 'perils', 'love', 'contemplating', 'just', 'how', 'authentic', 'own', 'passions', 'are']",Un Coeur En Hiver VHS

From that moment on I knew we were DOOMED!Not everyone wants to be happy- not happy in the sense, at least, that hollywood films would define it. I know this. I left my wife to listen to chamber music and am happier for it! That said, for many of us happiness is a concept which, despite our best efforts, evades us. One might argue that Daniel Auteuil's charatcer is such a man. Auteuil plays a man lost in his own self constructed solitude. The title of the film tells us something about his emotional state. His relations with the people around him are understated and withdrawn.  He has his work and his music- music which provides a wonderful canvas for the story of the film. He makes violins.  Somewhere in the film he becomes drawn to one of his clients, Emmanuelle B&eacute;art. She is attracted to his deep silence. They play around each other in the purely figurative sense. For much of the film neither of them really do anything about it. She doesn't seems to know what has hold of her and he does all he can to avoid it. And so it goes...The tension is exquisite and the subtlety is superb.The interesting questions raised in the narrative about the quality of happiness are left unresolved. Daniel Auteuil's character is not an unhappy man- The 'Winter' of the title is open to interpretation. His 'winter', if anything, is rather like the music Emmanuelle plays on her violin, tentative and fragile, austere and resolute, solemn, peaceful and brilliant...If you have a brain watch it with someone you have met and test them with it.

348919,A33H0WC9MI8OVW,6302973570,Clare Chu,"[3, 4]","Stephane is a master luthier, and can release the inner soul of a violin, by just nudging the bridge, or pushing the soundpost, he can bring magical sound and responsiveness to a violin.  In so doing, he captures the heart of a beautiful violinist, herself repressed and detached, except when she plays.  Camille, the violinist, finds herself inexplicably drawn to the quiet and withdrawn Stephane, who himself prefers to stay in the background, guard his own feelings and defer to his more flamboyant partner Maxime who is openly dating Camille.  Yet, he allows Camille to see a glimpse of his love for music, the magic in dreams, and seduces her mentally and emotionally, by really listening to her and faithfully attending her recording sessions.  In one session, he rushes in and insists on adjusting the instrument after hearing her play.  Camille is then able to play with more emotion, feelings and passion, which in turn kindles a desire in her to draw out Stephane and have him experience the emotions he had awakened in her instrument.Knowing that the instrument is an alter-ego to the musician, Stephane elicits the soloist to fall in love with him.  However when she admits to him that she is in love with him, he cannot take the heightened emotionally charged atmosphere and withdraws further into his shell.  Even though he was drawn into caring about Camille, Stephane denies it emphatically, which hurts Camille tremendously.  About now the violin is forgotten, and the love triangle storyline marches on through a public humiliation, a broken partnership, with Camille returning to Maxime.  As they drive off, she looks back at Stephane wistfully, who then returns to his usual business (or so it seems).One is left with the feeling of loss and uncertainty for both Stephane and Camille, yet realizing that this ending is more realistic in the human drama, than a ""happily ever after"" type of ending typical in American films.

348920,A1YIYS3J7EQ3F8,6302973570,"C. Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[8, 10]","Un Coeur En Hiver (A Heart in Winter), dir. Claude Sautet, 1993With: Daniel Auteuil, Emmanuelle Beart, Andre  Dussollier""Coeur"" is a romantic story, without a trace of sentimentality. That may be because of the restrain shown by the director, famous ""New Wave"" auteur Claude Sautet, but not exactly one of the likes of Jean-Paul Godard, Francois Truffaut, or Eric Rohmer. This is a story told linearly, with a clear, concise narrative, with no fat in it, a lean, straightforward romantic story; and yet is different from most Hollywood products, with the obligatory happy ending. Instead, ""Coeur"" delves into the exploration of the male psyche (the female here is familiar ground) and purports to account for an alleged failure to love, or relate in the human adventure for love (of the opposite sex) that most male humans embark on. The failure turns up an unexpected positive note, but not after much pain has been inflicted both on male and female protagonists.Let us explain: Stephan is a young genius with musical instruments--violins in this case--which he is able to repair to their pristine sound quality, even improve them in the processes.  He works for a slightly older partner--Maxim (Dussollier)--who is good at public relations, making sure his clients are well satisfied with both the service and social amenities he is careful to provide. He and Stephan are friends, though the word is not spoken, and good partners. They work in tandem, and in harmony, until a beautiful young violinist, Camille (Beart), appears in the horizon. Maxim confesses to Stephan that he has been seeing her for months, and, though he is serious bout her, their relationship is lukewarm and passionless. Stephan is called upon to help repair her violin, and Camille develops a sudden and intense passion him. Stephan shows retraint, despite feelings for her that he seems to try to supress. They have a few electric moments together, running for shelter in a rainstorm, but Camille is frustrated by his refusal to admit any feelings for her; or for Maxim, or anybody else for that matter. He admits his locked up and empty inside, and prefers to stay that way, uninvolved and independent. She has a breakdown, drinks, makes a scene at a caf&eacute;, and Stephan becomes the object of derision by his friend Maxim, who slaps him in anger.The collapse of this relationship brings about a resolution, and a gradual restoration of Stephan's character. He helps a dying friend in a compassionate scene of euthanasia, something his wife cannot do. Stephan is far from a man without feelings. When he and Maxim meet again, Stephan has moved to a place of his own, where he has established a new workshop, and started a new life. He meets with Camille too, before she goes on a tour--she is now famous. The final meeting is at a caf&eacute; (again) with all three, and it seems Maxim and Camille are now together permanently. Maxim retreats discreetly and leaves the two together for a few moments. Camille shows she has had a revelation. ""You loved him, she says, and his replied is, ""He was not the only one I loved."" Camille and Maxim drive away, and her from her last look at him we know she still loves him (Stephan), and that he still loves her too. It is clear, his love for Maxim was at least as strong, and barrier to any involvement with Camille.This is a strange phenomenon to the amoral world of today, when betrayal for the same of sex knows no barriers. It's easy to jump into bed with a female who is beautiful and who wants you, and it's even harder where passion is pressing. Camille suffered a rejection of her femaleness, her pride, her beauty, and her talent. She loved Stephan for his unpretentious genius--his subtlety with fixing a musical instrument, his fine sensibility, even his restraint. But she resented his not letting go when the passion was exploding in him too. She could not see his inner struggle, and could not forgive him. Love here is more like a Racinian madness, which needs to be satisfied regardless of ethics or other social restraints. Friendship cannot resist passion--a very French theme, known down the centuries from Racine to Flaubert--but passion is destructive, regardless of specific situations. Stephan reserve seems almost irrational, and yet his struggle--misunderstood for cowardice and lack of commitment--surfaces only momentarily, and at the end eases into a quiet affliction.There are fine-tuned points here, and this move shows that it is possible to take a story with the possibilities of tragedy and make it uplifting; for in the end both Maxim and Camille understand Stephan's depth and sacrifice. Yet, the trust of a friend means something, a positive note for the withdrawn Stephan (and the brilliance of Auteuil as an actor confirms this), who now wins the sympathy and perhaps the real love of both his friends. He claims no rights of his own, checks both his id and his ego, prefers to be hurt--even a touch of masochism here--knows what it is to be sad, and accepts what he must.The question for me after viewing this movie repeatedly is whether Stephan loves Camille or not. A superb technician, he avoids her all too obvious admiration, rejects her when she declares herself Auteuil's subtle performance, and the title, suggest a void in his heart, inability to love. My impression is that his battling his real feelings, perhaps in deference to his friend. And when he summon the courage (and compassion) to administer a euthanasia shot to a dying friend, Camille takes a second look at a man she thought lacks a heart. Her parting look at the last caf&eacute; scene clearly shows she still loves him, for different reasons. A fine touch, a refusal to love, when love is also betrayal.",4,Romance French Style,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,5744,"['Un', 'Coeur', 'En', 'Hiver', 'A', 'Heart', 'Winter', 'dir', 'Claude',

348921,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,6302973570,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[2, 2]","Un Coeur en Hiver is a masterpiece in so many ways. It is a quiet film that draws you in and keeps you captivated for the full 105 minutes. At no point did I ever try to fast forward this film, including the gorgeous music sessions.The story is love triangle between Maxime, the owner of a violin repair shop; Camille, a young and rising violinist; and Stephane, the humble artisan in the repair shop. Maxime is in love with Camille (absolutely stunning gorgeous Emmanuelle B&eacute;art). Camille begins to fall in love with stoic Stephane, while staying with Maxime. As the film progresses Camille shows more and more affection for Stephane. The twist, Stephane refuses her love. According to the DVD special feature interview with director Claude Sautet, this is Othello told from the perspective of Iago, or Stephane in this film.The reference to Shakespeare is wonderful, and those that love literature will love this film just for the reference. However, this is a film that requires absolutely no knowledge of that play to enjoy the beauty Sautet brought the screen.The music is absolutely stunning. Even if a person does not love classical music, the music playing moments are so perfect. Sautet uses the interludes where Camille plays the violin as rests or a changes in the story line; the timing is so exactly right. Apparently, Emmanuelle B&eacute;art spent a year taking violin lessons preparing for this part.The film is set in Paris at a time when service and appearances matter deeply. Stephane and Camille enter a crowded restaurant for a quick break during her recording session. There are no tables, so the maitre'd shows them to the bar. They order a cheese plate and a beer. A few moments later the bar tender leans over and says a table has just opened up. The try to take the plate and glass. The bartender stops them and has a waiter come over to deliver their food to the table. A small moment, a gracious moment, the kind of thing that happened in Paris all the time. People dressed nicely, they were polite to eachother, and service was number one.Not rated by the MPAA. Elsewhere in the world it is rated 12/13/14. There is no strong language in the subtitles. There is no nudity. There is no violence. There is one somewhat senuous scene where a nude female back is shown in bed, but nobody else is in that bed (a chaste but senuous scene because of what the imagination says happened - that's the most powerful type of this scene). The film is very far from R rated, it might be PG-13, but if the MPAA were honest, this is a PG film. In French with English subtitles that can be turned off. No English soundtrack.The bonus features on this DVD are very interesting. Again Europeans seem to understand how to pack useful things onto DVD's. There's a couple of old news clips from French Television (TF1, when it existed). The best are the interviews with the director. He explains some interesting backdrops to this film. I found them worthwhile.A masterpiece that doesn't require special acquired tastes to view. A person can simply start this film, sit back and be entertained. Sautet takes care of making you care about the three characters. He takes care of the beautiful music. And he makes sure you are moved by this film.",5,A Masterpiece of Love,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,3256,"['Un', 'Coeur', 'en', 'Hiver', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'quiet', 'film', 'keeps', 'captivated', 'full', '105', 'minutes', 'point', 'did', 'ever', 'try', 'fast', 'forward', 'film', 'including', 'gorgeous', 'music', 'sessions.The', 'story', 'love', 'triangle', 'Maxime', 'owner', 'violin', 'repair', 'shop', 'Camille', 'young', 'rising', 'violinist', 'Stephane', 'humble', 'artisan', 'repair', 'shop', 'Maxime', 'love', 'Camille', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'gorgeous', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'art', 'Camille', 'fall', 'love', 'stoic', 'Stephane', 'staying', 'Maxime', 'film', 'Camille', 'more', 'more', 'affection', 'Stephane', 'twist', 'Stephane', 'love', 'According', 'DVD', 'special', 'feature', 'interview', 'director', 'Claude', 'Sautet', 'Othello', 'told', 'perspective', 'Iago', 'Stephane', 'film.The', 'reference', 'Shakespeare', 'wonderful', 'love', 'literature', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'just', 'reference', 'However', 'film', 'absolutely', 'knowledge', 'play', 'enjoy', 'beauty', 'Sautet', 'brought', 'screen.The', 'music', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Even', 'person', 'not', 'love', 'classical', 'music', 'music', 'playing', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'Sautet', 'interludes', 'where', 'Camille', 'violin', 'rests', 'changes', 'story', 'line', 'timing', 'so', 'exactly', 'right', 'Apparently', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'spent', 'year', 'taking', 'violin', 'lessons', 'preparing', 'part.The', 'film', 'set', 'Paris', 'time', 'when', 'service', 'appearances', 'matter', 'deeply', 'Stephane', 'Camille', 'enter', 'crowded', 'restaurant', 'quick', 'break', 'recording', 'session', 'are', 'tables', 'maitre', ""'d"", 'shows', 'bar', 'order', 'cheese', 'plate', 'beer', 'few', 'moments', 'later', 'bar', 'tender', 'table', 'just', 'opened', 'up', 'try', 'take', 'plate', 'glass', 'bartender', 'waiter', 'come', 'deliver', 'food', 'table', 'small', 'moment', 'gracious', 'moment', 'kind', 'thing', 'happened', 'Paris', 'time', 'People', 'dressed', 'nicely', 'were', 'polite', 'eachother', 'service', 'was', 'number', 'one.Not', 'rated', 'MPAA', 'Elsewhere', 'world', 'rated', '12/13/14', 'strong', 'language', 'subtitles', 'nudity', 'violence', 'one', 'somewhat', 'senuous', 'scene', 'where', 'nude', 'female', 'back', 'shown', 'bed', 'nobody', 'else', 'bed', 'chaste', 'senuous', 'scene', 'what', 'imagination', 'happened', 'most', 'powerful', 'type', 'scene', 'film', 'very', 'far', 'R', 'rated', 'might', 'be', 'PG-13', 'MPAA', 'were', 'honest', 'PG', 'film', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'English', 'soundtrack.The', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'Again', 'Europeans', 'seem', 'understand', 'how', 'pack', 'useful', 'things', 'DVD', 'couple', 'old', 'news', 'clips', 'French', 'Television', 'TF1', 'when', 'existed', 'best', 'are', 'interviews', 'director', 'interesting', 'backdrops', 'film', 'found', 'worthwhile.A', 'masterpiece', ""n't"", 'require', 'special', 'acquired', 'tastes', 'view', 'person', 'can', 'simply', 'start', 'film', 'sit', 'back', 'be', 'entertained', 'Sautet', 'care', 'making', 'care', 'three', 'characters', 'care', 'beautiful', 'music', 'sure', 'are', 'moved', 'film']",Un Coeur En Hiver VHS
348922,AE12AEJFCOGGY,6302973570,"David Montgomery ""Book Critic""","[97, 98]","The title translates as ""a heart in winter.""  A cold heart, bereft of love.  A heart incapable of any emotion at all.  That describes Stephane (Daniel Auteuil), a solitary violin maker and repairman.  A man with the  soul of an artist, but none of the talent.Stephane is partnered with  Maxime (Andre Dussollier) in a thriving business.  Maxime is everything  that Stephane is not: gregarious, confident, extroverted.  Together they  form a successful team.  Maxime brings in the clients and Stephane does the  work.  They both are quite happy.One day Maxime introduces Stephane to  his new love, Camille (Emmanuel Beart), a beautiful violinist.  He is cold  to her at first, but the music she makes gradually stirs something in him.  She in turns responds to him.  She can sense that he has the heart of a  musician, but something is wrong.  Something is keeping him from opening  his heart to anyone else.  That something is music.  Stephane is surrounded  constantly by beautiful music, but none of it emanates from him.We come  to realize why Stephane, once a promising musician, gave up music.  The  sounds his fingers made could never equal the music he heard in his soul so  he quit.  Rather than risk the pain of further disappointment in life, he  chose instead to feel nothing at all.  If that meant forgoing love, it was  a price that he had to pay.Camille eventually confesses to Maxime that  she is in love with his partner.  Maxime is hurt, but what can he do?  She  goes to Stephane.  We can see that he probably loves her as well, but still  he refuses her.  He will not allow her into his heart.  She is hurt by  this, but she has her music and Maxime and, perhaps, that is enough.  She  is too proud to play the woman scorned.Emmanuelle Beart gives a truly  wonderful performance as Camille.  She is stunning to look at, of course,  but as a gifted actress, she will not settle for just that.  Her work is  meticulously crafted, imbibing her role with dignity and grace.  She  studied for a year to learn to be a convincing violinist and she succeeds  magnificently.Daniel Auteuil is also excellent, playing the difficult  part of a man who keeps his thoughts and emotions very much to himself.  It  is a subtle performance, filled with poignant suggestions and nuances.  His  carefully guarded expressions and manner prove that still waters do run  deep.As is typical of most of the finer French films, &quot;Un Coeur en  Hiver&quot; is a very mature, adult film.  Not in the sexual sense--there  is nothing even remotely objectionable in it--but rather in terms of its  thoughtfulness and sophistication.  The relationships in this film, as in  real life, demonstrate that love is never easy.  There isn't always a happy  ending, and just because a man and a woman should get together, that does  not mean they will.",4,"Sad, Beautiful Tale of Unrequited Love",959212800,"05 25, 2000",2000,2836,"['title', 'heart', 'winter', 'cold', 'heart', 'bereft', 'love', 'heart', 'incapable', 'emotion', 'Stephane', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'solitary', 'violin', 'maker', 'repairman', 'man', 'soul', 'artist', 'none', 'talent.Stephane', 'partnered', 'Maxime', 'Andre', 'Dussollier', 'thriving', 'business', 'Maxime', 'everything', 'Stephane', 'not', 'gregarious', 'confident', 'extroverted', 'Together', 'form', 'successful', 'team', 'Maxime', 'clients', 'Stephane', 'work', 'are', 'quite', 'happy.One', 'day', 'Maxime', 'Stephane', 'new', 'love', 'Camille', 'Emmanuel', 'Beart', 'beautiful', 'violinist', 'cold', 'first', 'music', 'gradually', 'stirs', 'something', 'turns', 'responds', 'can', 'sense', 'heart', 'musician', 'something', 'wrong', 'Something', 'keeping', 'opening', 'heart', 'anyone', 'else', 'something', 'music', 'Stephane', 'surrounded', 'constantly', 'beautiful', 'music', 'none', 'him.We', 'come', 'realize', 'why', 'Stephane', 'once', 'promising', 'musician', 'gave', 'up', 'music', 'fingers', 'made', 'could', 'never', 'equal', 'music', 'heard', 'soul', 'so', 'quit', 'Rather', 'risk', 'pain', 'further', 'disappointment', 'life', 'chose', 'instead', 'feel', 'nothing', 'meant', 'forgoing', 'love', 'was', 'price', 'had', 'pay.Camille', 'eventually', 'Maxime', 'love', 'partner', 'Maxime', 'hurt', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Stephane', 'can', 'see', 'probably', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'heart', 'hurt', 'music', 'Maxime', 'perhaps', 'enough', 'too', 'proud', 'play', 'woman', 'scorned.Emmanuelle', 'Beart', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Camille', 'stunning', 'look', 'course', 'gifted', 'actress', 'will', 'not', 'settle', 'just', 'work', 'meticulously', 'crafted', 'imbibing', 'role', 'dignity', 'grace', 'studied', 'year', 'learn', 'be', 'convincing', 'violinist', 'magnificently.Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'also', 'excellent', 'playing', 'difficult', 'part', 'man', 'who', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'very', 'much', 'subtle', 'performance', 'filled', 'poignant', 'suggestions', 'nuances', 'carefully', 'guarded', 'expressions', 'manner', 'prove', 'still', 'do', 'run', 'deep.As', 'typical', 'most', 'finer', 'French', 'films', 'quot', 'Un', 'Coeur', 'en', 'Hiver', 'quot', 'very', 'mature', 'adult', 'film', 'Not', 'sexual', 'sense', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'objectionable', 'rather', 'terms', 'thoughtfulness', 'sophistication', 'relationships', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'demonstrate', 'love', 'never', 'easy', ""n't"", 'always', 'happy', 'ending', 'just', 'man', 'woman', 'should', 'get', 'together', 'not', 'mean', 'will']",Un Coeur En Hiver VHS

I found it difficult, really in truth, impossible to empathize with the characters. This is not the type of sad I'd cry over.Set primarily in an urban French setting (cafes, restaurants, city streets, music recording studios, etc.), the interloper captures the beloved and then tells his beloved ...it was all a cruel game. He tells her he doesn't love her while his eyes tell her he loves her. Centered around beauty from across a canyon, his love melts the ice princess and topples her, then he runs away. He continues to return to her to offer glimpses of his love and remind her of his inability love her. Again, not the kind of behavior I'd cry over.I wondered throughout the film if the guy would come around, a question that kept me watching to the end! You'll have to find out for yourself. If this was something other than French cinema, there would be a sequel.Although there were many things that didn't capture my heart, this was still a film worth watching.

348938,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6302973570,Mr. Cairene,"[25, 27]","It's a fine art this violin tuning. Watching the characters in Claude Sautet's Un Coeur En Hiver (A Heart in Winter) as they debate the clarity, density and heaviness of that instrument's voice, you may think that it's all in their head. The beautiful instrument's incompetence nothing but a manifestation of their own insecurities. But then the process of watching this lovely film is, in itself, a fine art. In its delicate progress, the viewer is drawn in till he/she hears entire exchanges in a shared glance. Pain, humor, relief and agony in a moment of silence. Another person wondering in midway through the film may ask what in the world is so absorbing. There are scenes of great beauty in the film, there is a superb use of music, ""those irrelevant dreams"". But as in Sautet's somewhat lesser Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud, what is left unsaid, unresolved and unrequited is far more important then what is.There are two sets of masters and their apprentices in the film. Maxime (Andre Dussollier) and his business partner Stephane (Daniel Auteuil). Together, they own a shop where the reticent Stephane builds and fixes violins with great precision, and Maxime handles the business and social side of things. Then there is Camille (Emanuelle Beart) and her agent Regine (Brigitte Cattilon). Both Camille and Stephane appear frigid at first, they channel all their energy into their work, while the others live their lives for them. It is a convenient way of life for Stephane, the Heart in Winter of the title. But Camille is still open, still warm enough to seek love. So when Maxime introduces Camille as his lover, there is visible hurt on Stephane's face. At first it seems that he is jealous of her, or him, but then I realised that he was jealous of their readiness to, and faith in love. A tentative and unacknowledged romance develops between Stephane and Camille. They meet at the studio, and he takes her out for a drink. For the first time in the film, she smiles. They seem to be comfortable together. And since this is a French film, love is not defined as some magical formula, but a relationship in which each partner could to dilute their obsessions, to be at ease with themselves. But Stephane freezes, he breaks off all voluntary contact with Camille.It is tempting to think that this abrupt change of heart on his part was because of fear, a reluctance to give up his carefully constructed world. Perhaps his dedication to his craft was so great, that he feared his love of Camille would lessen the quality of his work. Why would he ever attempt to make the perfect violin when perfection is right beside him in Emmanuelle Beart. And my, is she perfect. It is even more tempting to believe that he has abandoned her for the sake of his friend in a Casablanca sort of sacrifice. What makes the A Heart in Winter so special is that Sautet doesn't choose either of those easy answers, although they are viable.

After a while, I decided to check out what all the fuss was about and rented it. I will never regret this decision.I have a passion for French films and have seen quite a few in my time, but rarely has a movie touched my heart like this film has. Camille is a talented violinist who falls for her lover's business partner, St&eacute;phane. All this seemed scandalously romantic until St&eacute;phane's true colors were revealed: he is incapable of emotional intimacy.I have read some reviews that have said the plot is lacking, but the plot was what drew me in right away. Perhaps it is because of the way the actors pulled off their roles, which is pretty much seamlessly.What I enjoyed most about ""Un Coeur En Hiver"" were the intelligent yet casual dialogues. The things talked about were ordinary, everyday things yet were still interesting. I myself have rarely come across people who could hold an intellectual conversation like the ones in this film. I do not mean to sound egotistical, but I simply enjoy having a conversation with someone politely, wittily and casually. This movie allows me to escape to an ideal place.""Un Coeur En Hiver"" is not a movie for everyone.

348941,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6302973570,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[7, 9]","The Violin music in this movie is sweet and sorrowful. It is a true representation of what occurs in the hearts of the main charactersIs there anything as beautiful as love and anything as painful as deep sorrow and loneliness of the soul? What happens when two people connect and their hearts start to vibrate together like violins with broken strings? Can they heal enough to create beautiful music?The concert violinist, Camille, is dating Maxim who is an older man she seems to love and feels a deep commitment to. The problem in this story is the inevitable love triangle. Maxim loves Camille and yet he realizes she is still young and restless. When Camille first meets Stephan she only sees him across a room. Later she brings in her violin for repairs and you can feel the sexual tension between them.There is always a danger when you listen to someone and show interest in a person's deepest loves, their desires and their dreams. It is well known that women fall in love with men who are willing to listen to them. Stephan seems willing to listen to Camille and in the process he realizes he could hurt his best friend Maxim who he deeply loves. When the situation starts to get complex, he suddenly withdraws his attention and this makes Camille obsessive and needy.While the movie tries to make us believe Stephan (Daniel Auteuil) is at fault, he seems to be more of an innocent party in the entire seduction. Camille is much more aggressive and yet she has her reasons for believing she should be loved. His physical actions only led me to believe he was genuinely interested in helping Camille (Emmanuelle Beart) reach her full potential as a concert violinist. The emotional undercurrents tell a different story.The mysterious Stephan sees the violin needs work, but fails to see Camille's sensitive heart needs fine tuning. When he listens to her play, he can feel her emotions flowing freely to his heart and we know he could be moved to passion. Yet, it is quite ironic how he is fully capable of quickly figuring out why a violin won't play properly, but can't seem to figure out what makes a woman's heart play. He seems to have absolutely no awareness of how his attention affects Camille. While Stephan no longer plays the violin, there is definitely a soul connection between the two artists. There is a unique chemistry between them that is on fire from the time they first meet. The fire Camille feels quickly gets out of control.Stephan is an interesting study. He seems fearful of life, yet confident at his job. He seems cold on the outside, but is simmering with desires on the inside. He sees opportunities and then takes the opposite path. Is he selfish or selfless? Does he see the world in a different way than Camille? She is spontaneous and gives her heart away easily. Stephan contemplates the future results of his future actions and continually decides not to act. He almost seems to be living in the past or trying not to move too quickly into the future.We watch him observe life around him. Relationships start, they end, they enter periods of conflict and summers of love. He watches children playing and you can almost hear him wondering if he will one day start a family of his own. He sees Maxim as blessed and yet he is almost satisfied on some level with his solitary existence. He has a friend who owns a bookstore and she listens and encourages Stephan in the direction of a fulfilled life.Is there a way for Camille and Stephan to play beautiful music together? As this story unravels, your imagination will create your most desired conclusion. Stephan knows how to repair violins, but can he fix a broken heart? How he can resist Camille, we will never know. Does Stephan make the right decision? It is up to you to decide.Emmanuelle Beart has to be the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. I kept having to rewind the tape to read the subtitles because I was so mesmerized by her beauty and acting. This is now my favorite French film and the kindness of the friend who sent me a copy will not soon be forgotten!Deliciously Intellectual and Intensely Beautiful.

348945,A28TSZUILM00N4,6302973570,schumann_bg,"[0, 0]","The majority of reviewers are surely right to praise this film very highly; it is really very subtle, and can be returned to with renewed pleasure. A couple of things strike me from my own left field perspective: first, it may well be that Daniel Auteuil's character is sexually ambiguous, and that this may account for his oddly withheld actions. There is one moment when his male assistant, Brice, leaves the workshop with a young woman who has come to meet him and there is something in Auteuil's glance at him that suggests a possible attraction. At the end of the film Brice is going to marry with Stephane as his best man, a role he seems happy to take on. Given the age difference, Brice's heterosexuality and Stephane's reserve, it seems very likely that if there were some sense of desire on his part it would go unmentioned, and may not even be something he thinks of in those terms. It's also intriguing for the way it mirrors the question mark over Ravel's own sexuality, about which nothing seems to be concretely known, but it's not hard to imagine that the composer of L'Heure Espagnole might have been gay. As if to play up the parallel Stephane collects mechanical toys exactly as Ravel did.The film does present a sympathetic portrayal of a gay female character of a more overt type, possibly in counterpoint to this; Regine, Camille's agent, is in many ways the most levelheaded and considerate of the main characters. As another reviewer has pointed out, for all his warmth Maxime does leave his wife without too much concern, it seems, simply remarking that someone always suffers. The film seems to suggest, at the end, that nearly everyone suffers a bit, and that such is the nature of life - except Brice, perhaps, but we don't see much of him ... Another point of interest to me was to recognise this actor and only later to make a link with Au Revoir Les Enfants in which he plays the main character's older brother.

Each of the characters loves another, but often not in a way that can be manifested. Camille has to stuggle with her conflicting emotions and streesful and burdensome career. While Stephan and Maxime struggle with each other within their violin repair business.The acting in the movie is generally very excellent, with the exception of some of the scenes where the actors can not quite coax out the correct emotions. The script leaves somethings to be desired as well, featuring extended conversations on things that are irrelevant to advancing the plot (not that this is always a bad thing, but typically there should be at least some value in that type of dialouge).The movie ended on a pretty unfulfilling anti-climax, but was never the less a very interesting movie to watch and one whose meaning and subtleties can be discussed and debated for hours.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys French cinema.",4,A little Dark and Strange movie...,1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,1234,"['brother', 'rented', 'movie', 'accident', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'slip', 'paper', 'gave', 'reading', 'Un', 'Chien', 'Andalou', 'got', 'Un', 'Coeur', 'En', 'Hiver', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'made', 'mistake', 'am', 'glad', 'movie', 'concerns', 'love', 'lack', 'thereof', 'triangle', 'three', 'people', 'Camille', 'Stephan', 'Maxime', 'characters', 'often', 'not', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'manifested', 'Camille', 'stuggle', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'streesful', 'burdensome', 'career', 'Stephan', 'Maxime', 'struggle', 'other', 'violin', 'repair', 'acting', 'movie', 'generally', 'very', 'excellent', 'exception', 'scenes', 'where', 'actors', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'coax', 'correct', 'emotions', 'script', 'somethings', 'be', 'desired', 'as', 'well', 'featuring', 'extended', 'conversations', 'things', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'advancing', 'plot', 'not', 'always', 'bad', 'thing', 'typically', 'should', 'be', 'least', 'value', 'type', 'dialouge', 'movie', 'ended', 'pretty', 'unfulfilling', 'anti-climax', 'was', 'never', 'less', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'watch', 'one', 'meaning', 'subtleties', 'can', 'be', 'discussed', 'debated', 'hours.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'French', 'cinema']",Un Coeur En Hiver VHS
348948,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6302973570,Westley,"[7, 7]","""Un Coeur en Hiver"" translates into ""A Heart in Winter,"" which is an apt title for this chilly, cerebral French film from 1992.  Daniel Auteuil (Jean de Florette, Cache, Queen Margot) stars as an introverted unmarried man named Stephane, who repairs musical instruments in a shop owned by Maxime (played by Andre Dussollier).  The two men have what appears to be an excellent working relationship and seem like close friends.  One day, Maxime indicates that, even though he is married, he has fallen in love with a gorgeous young violinist, Camille, played by Emmanuelle Beart (Manon of the Spring, L'Enfer, 8 Women).  Camille becomes a customer, and when Stephane meets her to repair her violin, they immediately are drawn to each other.Based very loosely on the novella ""A Hero of Our Times"" by 19th century Russian writer Mikhail Lermontov, the film appears, on the surface level, to concern a love triangle.  However, the film examines relationships and love from a unique perspective; ultimately, it is more about jealousy and inexpression and their destructive forces than about love per se.  Yes, it is a very talky film, with very little ""action"" other than a few relatively muted arguments.  Nevertheless, ""Un Coeur en Hiver"" is spell-binding and engrossing.  It is my favorite type of French film - one that depicts beautiful people in beautiful settings struggling with issues not often seen in mainstream movies.Director Claude Sautet, who co-wrote the screenplay, does a masterful job with his three leads, who turn in very good performances.  Suatet won the Cesar (the French equivalent of the Oscar) for Best Directing, and Dussollier scored for Best Supporting Actor.  The film also makes wonderful organic use of classical music, especially works by Ravel.  I wasn't very familiar with Ravel but quickly fell in love with ""Piano Trio in A minor: No. 1, Modere"" which is used in a key scene.  The soundtrack, alas, is out of print.  However, lovers of classical music will likely enjoy seeing a film set against this background.  Really, it's a film for anyone who likes things a bit complicated.",4,A chilly examination of love,1269648000,"03 27, 2010",2010,2112,"['Un', 'Coeur', 'en', 'Hiver', 'A', 'Heart', 'Winter', 'apt', 'title', 'chilly', 'cerebral', 'French', 'film', '1992', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'Jean', 'de', 'Florette', 'Cache', 'Queen', 'Margot', 'introverted', 'unmarried', 'man', 'named', 'Stephane', 'who', 'musical', 'instruments', 'shop', 'owned', 'Maxime', 'played', 'Andre', 'Dussollier', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'what', 'be', 'excellent', 'working', 'relationship', 'seem', 'close', 'friends', 'One', 'day', 'Maxime', 'even', 'married', 'fallen', 'love', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'violinist', 'Camille', 'played', 'Emmanuelle', 'Beart', 'Manon', 'Spring', ""L'Enfer"", '8', 'Women', 'Camille', 'customer', 'when', 'Stephane', 'repair', 'violin', 'immediately', 'are', 'drawn', 'other.Based', 'very', 'loosely', 'novella', 'Hero', 'Times', '19th', 'century', 'Russian', 'writer', 'Mikhail', 'Lermontov', 'film', 'surface', 'level', 'concern', 'love', 'triangle', 'However', 'film', 'examines', 'relationships', 'love', 'unique', 'perspective', 'ultimately', 'more', 'jealousy', 'inexpression', 'destructive', 'forces', 'love', 'se', 'Yes', 'very', 'talky', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'other', 'few', 'relatively', 'muted', 'arguments', 'Nevertheless', 'Un', 'Coeur', 'en', 'Hiver', 'spell-binding', 'engrossing', 'favorite', 'type', 'French', 'film', 'one', 'beautiful', 'people', 'beautiful', 'settings', 'struggling', 'issues', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'mainstream', 'movies.Director', 'Claude', 'Sautet', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'masterful', 'job', 'three', 'leads', 'who', 'turn', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Suatet', 'won', 'Cesar', 'French', 'equivalent', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Directing', 'Dussollier', 'scored', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'film', 'also', 'wonderful', 'organic', 'use', 'classical', 'music', 'especially', 'Ravel', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'familiar', 'Ravel', 'quickly', 'fell', 'love', 'Piano', 'Trio', 'A', 'minor', '1', 'Modere', 'used', 'key', 'scene', 'soundtrack', 'alas', 'print', 'However', 'lovers', 'classical', 'music', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'film', 'set', 'background', 'Really', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'things', 'bit', 'complicated']",Un Coeur En Hiver VHS
