Any of the Bell Science Series made us kids happy to see our teacher break out the projector (we didn't have video tape or DVDs then!).  The Chuck Jones animated sequences envokes the style of Bugs Bunny, The Grinch, and Tom & Jerry cartoons. The second episode in this set is about genetics from Mendel's pea plant experiments all the way to the then newly described DNA structure. Dr. Frank Baxter, sometimes called ""Dr. Research"" in the Bell Series, is charming and informative as always.

However, most unfortunately, the Gateways/Thread disc was defective, so I had to send it back. I requested a replacement. It contained the same defect.
