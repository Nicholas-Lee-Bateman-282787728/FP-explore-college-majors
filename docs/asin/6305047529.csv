445215,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6305047529,Acute Observer,"[0, 23]","This film was inspired by the short stories of James Thurber. Walter Mitty drives to the train station in a small NJ town that resembles southern California. Mitty works for a publishing company in Manhattan that prints racy detective stories and other popular magazines (classified as ""escapist"" literature). Mitty's daydreams are interspersed with his real life. An imagined operation has comic touches. His fiance's dog doesn't trust him. His furnace has logs that burn quickly (unlike in the real world). Mitty's comic musician seems quite outdated. On his morning train he meets a strange woman who ask for his help. Mitty's life quickly becomes complicated, far more than in any daydream. He has become involved in dangerous situation. Will he survive?The story continues with comic scares and scenes. They now seek a missing notebook that was placed into a woman's corset. Scenes switch from reality to fantasy. Does Mitty need a psychiatrist? Does his job affect his imagination? The film runs on with more scenes of comic terror. At the end there is a surprise. This film tells what Hollywood thought would please customers. Did it?

A very thin story line is beautifully padded by the multiple personalities played out in the daydreams of our erstwhile anti-hero. A wonderful cameo from Boris Karloff adds to the comic excitement of a fast paced story, and Kaye delivers brilliantly with impeccable timing during each sub plot. Almost a multiple picture in picture movie, the ending really holds no suprises, but gently jogs the viewer along, without some of the kitch so prevalent in other movies of the era. Danny Kaye really was a comic genius, and in some ways the picture reflects his own life which was widely believed to be that of a painfully shy and reserved man.

It is one of those classic Hollywood comedies that just makes you happy. It's got so much going for it: the incomparable Danny Kaye, a hilarious premise involving dangerous jewel thieves, lovely Virginia Mayo, wonderful fantasy/daydream sequences, and the sinister Boris Karloff.Danny Kaye is completely in his element here, playing a nervous wimp who escapes his dull life (controlling mother, and tedious job at the paperback publishing company) through daydreams of romance and adventure.Until I saw this movie I had no idea how very gifted Kaye was. He can make a reaction to toast popping up seem hysterically funny. His timing and acting are brilliant, and his physical comedy is formidable.I just wish that he had made more comedy films in the 40's and 50's. But I suppose it's better to have done a few brilliant gems than a whole bunch of decent movies.I also recommend his films ""Wonder Man"", ""The Court Jester"", ""The Inspector General"", and also ""Knock on Wood"" (that last one is basically impossible to find anymore, so I wish they'd do a box set of his dvd movies!)...",4,Hilarious Comedy -- Danny Kaye is Perfect,1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,1163,"['have', 'been', 'love', 'film', 'first', 'saw', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'one', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', 'just', 'happy', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'incomparable', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'hilarious', 'premise', 'involving', 'dangerous', 'jewel', 'thieves', 'lovely', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'wonderful', 'fantasy/daydream', 'sequences', 'sinister', 'Boris', 'Karloff.Danny', 'Kaye', 'completely', 'element', 'here', 'playing', 'nervous', 'wimp', 'who', 'dull', 'life', 'controlling', 'mother', 'tedious', 'job', 'paperback', 'publishing', 'company', 'daydreams', 'romance', 'adventure.Until', 'saw', 'movie', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'very', 'gifted', 'Kaye', 'was', 'can', 'make', 'reaction', 'toast', 'popping', 'up', 'seem', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'timing', 'acting', 'are', 'brilliant', 'physical', 'comedy', 'formidable.I', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'made', 'more', 'comedy', 'films', '40', '50', 'suppose', 'better', 'have', 'done', 'few', 'brilliant', 'gems', 'whole', 'bunch', 'decent', 'movies.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'films', 'Wonder', 'Man', 'Court', 'Jester', 'Inspector', 'General', 'also', 'Knock', 'Wood', 'last', 'one', 'basically', 'impossible', 'find', 'anymore', 'wish', ""'d"", 'do', 'box', 'set', 'dvd', 'movies']",N/A

I thought the same of Up in Arms, Knock on Wood, The Court Jester, and all Kaye vehicles. I must have been more innocent in those far-off days, and, sadly, it is now not quite as good as I then thought it; in fact, memory had enhanced the classic scenes and the dream sequences had got even better over time, so that when I saw them again they were faintly disappointing. Still, anyone viewing the film for the first time should find it hugely enjoyable; and it is famous enough for the Walter Mitty Syndrome to have entered the language. The Thurber story is a greater work of art, and it is unsurprising that he disliked the way his wistful and ironic little invention had become distorted. The most memorable parts of the film were those wonderful, heroic fantasies: ""I'm taking her through: my arm is broken, but it's nothing""; ""Ach, Himmel, it is Valter der Mitty: I'm done for""; Walter ""Slim"" Mitty (the Mitty Kid) ""I wouldn't do that if I were you""; ""Coreopsis has set in""; ""Swallow 'em up, ole Mississippi --- mah regiment leaves at dawn"";  but none of them quite matched up to the way I remembered them.

It usually gets on my nerves when I see movie characters allowing themselves to be as put-upon and henpecked as Kaye's Walter is here, but there was a sweetness about him that made me root for him instead of merely growling, ""Oh, tell 'em all to go to hell already"" -- and as a result, it's that much more satisfying when Walter finally does tell off his obnoxious so-called friends and loved ones (unlike such ""comedies of cruelty"" as MADHOUSE, where the last 10 minutes of Revenge Against The Oppressors are the only entertaining parts of the movie)! Although James Thurber, another of my faves, reportedly tried to buy off producer Samuel Goldwyn to keep the film from being made and hated the finished product, I think perhaps Thurber wasn't being quite fair.  First off, books and film have different storytelling requirements, and second, the first 10 minutes are almost straight from Thurber's story (except it's Walter and his nagging mom instead of a nagging wife), and it seemed to me that the characters and performances had very Thurberesque qualities about them. Boris Karloff and Konstantin Shayne are delightfully unctuous villains (Fun Fact:  their henchman, Henry Corden, later became the voice of Fred Flintstone!). As Walter's literal and figurative dream girl Rosalind van Hoorn, frequent Kaye co-star Virginia Mayo was thoroughly beguiling and never looked lovelier (and hey, the radiant Mayo was a size 12 and nobody considered *her* a ""plus size,"" thank you very much! :-). TSLoWM also contains two of my favorite Kaye/Sylvia Fine musical numbers: ""Symphony for Unstrung Tongue"" (am I the only one who finds the line ""He gets so excited that he has a solo passage"" to be subtly salacious? :-) and ""Anatole of Paris."" To top it all off, it takes place primarily in my hometown and favorite city, New York City, and is set in one of my favorite milieus, pulp magazine publishing!  My hubby and I like to think that Uncle Peter's grand home must be located in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where we used to live, since it looks like the kind of houses we used to see while walking around in the Fieldston area and it didn't seem to take horrifically long for Walter and Rosalind to drive there from the Flatiron district of Manhattan! :-)  (Interestingly, the interior of the van Hoorn home looks a lot like the interior of evil Bruno Anthony's home in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN; anybody know if these scenes might have been shot in the same house/set?) I wish the DVD extras had included deleted scenes (there's a bit in the trailer with Karloff and Corden in a pub that I definitely don't recall seeing in the finished film), but it was nice to see Virginia Mayo still alive and well (and bigger than ""size 12,"" but on her it's pleasant plumpness, in my opinion! :-) in the intro and outro, even though she only had time to say one line about most of her co-stars (""Ann Rutherford was delightful...Fay Bainter was a consummate actress..."").",5,Danny Kaye Shines as Thurber Gets The Goldwyn Treatment,1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,3234,"['WONDER', 'MAN', 'THE', 'COURT', 'JESTER', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'consistently', 'wacky', 'thought', 'THE', 'SECRET', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'WALTER', 'MITTY', 'TSLoWM', 'brought', 'out', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'one', 'faves', 'childhood', 'never', 'missed', 'Kaye', 'movies', 'WPIX', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'usually', 'nerves', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'characters', 'allowing', 'be', 'put-upon', 'henpecked', 'Kaye', 'Walter', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'sweetness', 'made', 'root', 'instead', 'merely', 'growling', 'Oh', 'tell', 'go', 'hell', 'already', 'result', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'when', 'Walter', 'finally', 'tell', 'off', 'obnoxious', 'so-called', 'friends', 'loved', 'ones', 'such', 'comedies', 'cruelty', 'MADHOUSE', 'where', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'Revenge', 'Against', 'Oppressors', 'are', 'only', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'movie', 'James', 'Thurber', 'faves', 'reportedly', 'tried', 'buy', 'off', 'producer', 'Samuel', 'Goldwyn', 'keep', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'hated', 'finished', 'product', 'think', 'perhaps', 'Thurber', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'quite', 'fair', 'First', 'off', 'books', 'film', 'have', 'different', 'storytelling', 'requirements', 'second', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'are', 'almost', 'straight', 'Thurber', 'story', 'Walter', 'nagging', 'mom', 'instead', 'nagging', 'wife', 'seemed', 'characters', 'performances', 'had', 'very', 'Thurberesque', 'qualities', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'Konstantin', 'Shayne', 'are', 'delightfully', 'unctuous', 'villains', 'Fun', 'Fact', 'henchman', 'Henry', 'Corden', 'later', 'became', 'voice', 'Fred', 'Flintstone', 'Walter', 'literal', 'figurative', 'dream', 'girl', 'Rosalind', 'van', 'Hoorn', 'frequent', 'Kaye', 'co-star', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'beguiling', 'never', 'looked', 'lovelier', 'hey', 'radiant', 'Mayo', 'was', 'size', '12', 'nobody', 'considered', 'plus', 'size', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'TSLoWM', 'also', 'two', 'favorite', 'Kaye/Sylvia', 'Fine', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Symphony', 'Unstrung', 'Tongue', 'am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'line', 'so', 'excited', 'solo', 'passage', 'be', 'subtly', 'salacious', 'Anatole', 'Paris', 'top', 'off', 'place', 'primarily', 'hometown', 'favorite', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'set', 'one', 'favorite', 'milieus', 'pulp', 'magazine', 'publishing', 'hubby', 'like', 'think', 'Uncle', 'Peter', 'grand', 'home', 'must', 'be', 'located', 'Riverdale', 'section', 'Bronx', 'where', 'used', 'live', 'kind', 'houses', 'used', 'see', 'walking', 'around', 'Fieldston', 'area', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'horrifically', 'long', 'Walter', 'Rosalind', 'drive', 'there', 'Flatiron', 'district', 'Manhattan', 'Interestingly', 'interior', 'van', 'Hoorn', 'home', 'lot', 'interior', 'evil', 'Bruno', 'Anthony', 'home', 'STRANGERS', 'ON', 'A', 'TRAIN', 'anybody', 'know', 'scenes', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'same', 'house/set', 'wish', 'DVD', 'extras', 'had', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bit', 'trailer', 'Karloff', 'Corden', 'pub', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'finished', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'bigger', 'size', '12', 'pleasant', 'plumpness', 'opinion', 'intro', 'outro', 'even', 'only', 'had', 'time', 'say', 'one', 'line', 'most', 'co-stars', 'Ann', 'Rutherford', 'was', 'delightful', 'Fay', 'Bainter', 'was', 'consummate', 'actress']",N/A

You often get the impression there are two meanings...the &#34;obvious&#34; meaning for the general public, and the inside double meaning for the script writers and their little inside circle.Some think Danny Kaye was gay and that his scripts have a gay double-entendre. The evidence for Kaye's queerness is much contested (lots of debate about his supposed affair with Olivier) but either way I think it's clear that screenwriters of the time were so comfortable in the invisibility of gay culture that they had fun dropping a lot of double meanings in that back then went mostly unnoticed and today are just hilarious.Too bad this is out of print.

Need a highly skilled doctor to perform a nerve-racking surgery while up against the clock? Walter Mitty is the man. Need an expertly skilled air pilot to fly in World War 2, or a comedian/entertainer to help all the boys forget about the war with his little musical number? Yes, you guessed it: Walter Mitty.This is by far one of my favorite stories to read and best loved films. Based on James Thurber's story, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty stretches this story into a 100 minute feature film. Reportedly Thurber didn't like the movie too much, but, honestly, I believe there is little not to love in this movie. It does a superb job projecting the character Walter Mitty Thurber seemed to want to create. There is quite a deal more depth given to this character in the movie, and this is a good thing. Instead of just being a simple-minded man who dreams away from his uneventful life and wife to bigger and better things, this Walter Mitty leads two lives-the real, and the dream-which seemingly interconnect during the film.There are subtle differences from the short story. For instance, Walter's wife (in the story) is replaced with his nagging mother in the film. He is going to be married, and is not only nagged by his mother but also his fianc?. However, after he witnesses a murder, he begins to question what is real and what illusion is, including the girl of his dreams (Virginia Mayo).Another superb aspect of the film is simply the performance by Danny Kaye. Kaye embodies the very essence of Walter Mitty so well-there are the goofy moments when he nervously struggles to get away from danger, the entertaining parts where he is singing about musical devices, or showing the latest fashion, and the adventurous scenes where he is trying to help his damsel-in-distress escape countless villains (one of which is played by none other than villain legend Boris Karloff).Another great thing about the film is its quality. The DVD is in excellent quality, sound, transfer and color are fantastic. I'm so glad they brought this classic to DVD.This is an exceptional movie for the family to enjoy, or just a movie to cheer you up. It definitely has the comedic flavor that we expect from Danny Kaye films.I think we can all associate with the dreamer in Walter Mitty, because we all want to be heroic in some way.",5,The Dreamer in Us All,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,2419,"['Need', 'someone', 'save', 'girl', 'vicious', 'blackmailer', 'western', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'here', 'Need', 'highly', 'skilled', 'doctor', 'perform', 'nerve-racking', 'surgery', 'up', 'clock', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'man', 'Need', 'expertly', 'skilled', 'air', 'pilot', 'fly', 'World', 'War', '2', 'comedian/entertainer', 'help', 'boys', 'forget', 'war', 'little', 'musical', 'number', 'Yes', 'guessed', 'Walter', 'Mitty.This', 'far', 'one', 'favorite', 'stories', 'read', 'best', 'loved', 'films', 'Based', 'James', 'Thurber', 'story', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'story', '100', 'minute', 'feature', 'film', 'Reportedly', 'Thurber', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'honestly', 'believe', 'little', 'not', 'love', 'movie', 'superb', 'job', 'projecting', 'character', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'Thurber', 'seemed', 'want', 'create', 'quite', 'deal', 'more', 'depth', 'given', 'character', 'movie', 'good', 'thing', 'Instead', 'just', 'being', 'simple-minded', 'man', 'who', 'away', 'uneventful', 'life', 'wife', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'two', 'lives-the', 'real', 'dream-which', 'seemingly', 'interconnect', 'are', 'subtle', 'differences', 'short', 'story', 'instance', 'Walter', 'wife', 'story', 'replaced', 'nagging', 'mother', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'married', 'not', 'only', 'nagged', 'mother', 'also', 'fianc', 'However', 'murder', 'question', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'illusion', 'including', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'superb', 'aspect', 'film', 'simply', 'performance', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'Kaye', 'very', 'essence', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'well-there', 'are', 'goofy', 'moments', 'when', 'nervously', 'get', 'away', 'danger', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'where', 'singing', 'about', 'musical', 'devices', 'showing', 'latest', 'fashion', 'adventurous', 'scenes', 'where', 'trying', 'help', 'damsel-in-distress', 'escape', 'countless', 'villains', 'one', 'played', 'none', 'other', 'villain', 'legend', 'Boris', 'Karloff', '.Another', 'great', 'thing', 'film', 'quality', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'quality', 'sound', 'transfer', 'color', 'are', 'fantastic', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'brought', 'classic', 'DVD.This', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'family', 'enjoy', 'just', 'movie', 'cheer', 'up', 'definitely', 'comedic', 'flavor', 'expect', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'films.I', 'think', 'can', 'associate', 'dreamer', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'want', 'be', 'heroic', 'way']",N/A

A helpless hopeful who works for a publishing company and constanly gets himself into trouble by dreaming his life more fantastic. Whether it be doctor, fighter pilot or gambling gentleman, he becomes the man he wishes he could be but is absolutely not. Charming, debonaire, brave and sophisticated. The real Walter Mitty posesses none of these attributes.Things take a turn for him though as he finds himself mixed up with a beautiful woman who's in trouble and involved in a dangerous plan to retrieve a book containing locations for some hidden WWII paintings. A former nazi named ""The Boot"" is also aware of the book and will kill anyone in the way of securing it for himself.Unfortunately for Walter, no one knows or believes his story as these people who constantly call on him for help are never around when anyone else is. His Boss, co-workers, and family all chalk it up to his wild imaginations and story writing career. This all makes for some funny moments where Walters secret life soon becomes his real life. But nobody knows it but him.Danny Kaye does a wonderful job of selling every performance he's asked to. Every character he plays is totally different from the other and is a tribute to his versitility. He absolutely sells this movie and makes it work. A great performance. Keep an eye out for Boris Karloff in his psychiatrist role as well.The disc works well for what it is. The color looks very good and natural. Overall, it's pretty clean and doesn't cause any unnecessary distractions. The audio is typically mono and focused to the front speakers. Everything is clearly heard and distinguishable.

Seemingly, the daydreams are the only way of escape from milquetoast Walter's oppressive life, complete with a domineering mother, demanding fiance, and redundant job (writing suspense stories). The fun really begins when a woman (blond bombshell Virginia Mayo) bursts into his life, and suddenly, poor Mitty is thrust in the middle of a very real espionage situation, frought with danger. It's then fun to watch wide-eyed Kaye get tugged & pulled between what is his normal, henpecked existence, and his wobbling chance to beat the odds and become a true hero.The supporting cast (including the sinister presence of Boris Karloff) is top notch, and the story (particularly the fantasy sequences) benefit from the bright sparkle of a glossy MGM production.Definitely a Kaye classic that should be included in any fan's collection!",5,Kaye daydreams his way to box-office glory,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,1226,"['author', 'James', 'Thurber', 'had', 'serious', 'misgivings', 'MGM', 'adaptation', 'story', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty', '1947', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'undeniably', 'terrific', 'entertainment', 'wonderful', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'perfect', 'Thurber', 'hopelessly', 'daydreaming', 'character', 'fantasies', 'open', 'up', 'visually', 'amusing', 'heroics', 'tipocketica', 'sound', 'effect', 'thematically', 'running', 'fantasy', 'Seemingly', 'daydreams', 'are', 'only', 'way', 'escape', 'milquetoast', 'Walter', 'oppressive', 'life', 'complete', 'domineering', 'mother', 'demanding', 'fiance', 'redundant', 'job', 'writing', 'suspense', 'stories', 'fun', 'really', 'when', 'woman', 'blond', 'bombshell', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'life', 'suddenly', 'poor', 'Mitty', 'thrust', 'middle', 'very', 'real', 'espionage', 'situation', 'frought', 'danger', 'then', 'fun', 'watch', 'wide-eyed', 'Kaye', 'get', 'tugged', 'pulled', 'what', 'normal', 'henpecked', 'existence', 'wobbling', 'chance', 'beat', 'odds', 'become', 'true', 'hero.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'sinister', 'presence', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'top', 'notch', 'story', 'particularly', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'benefit', 'bright', 'sparkle', 'glossy', 'MGM', 'production.Definitely', 'Kaye', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'fan', 'collection']",N/A

BUTLER ""lost in las vegas""","[4, 4]","The problem facing the director of photography (Lee Garmes) and costume designer (Irene Sharaff) when designing this film was to transform Virginia Mayo's standard blonde sweet girl next door image into the larger than life figment of Walter Mitty's imagination. And later, when she enters his real world to turn the beauty factor one notch higher to the totally irresistible level.The images I've uploaded show how well they succeeded.  I can't think of any other ""star"" with a complexion as perfect as Virginia Mayo and maybe this is why attention is always drawn to her head not her body.  As can be seen by looking at some of her different personas she ably plays his ever faithful dream girl but looks even more enticing as a contemporary (40's) glamour girl.Of course it's great fun watching Kaye being bewitched during their first 3 encounters but Mayo's acting is also so effortless one hardly notices how well she plays her different characters. Best demonstrated when the Gaylord Mitty riverboat gambling dream quickly transitions into their second meeting outside his office where from being his besotted southern belle she morphs into modern seductress - instantly reversing the roles they played 2 minutes earlier.One incongruity I still find just as bemusing as when I first saw this movie in 1948 is where did Mayo change into her perfect ensembles if she's not living with her wicked uncle in the suburbs (of California)?  Did she even have a life of her own beyond always being available to play parts in Walter Mitty's dreams?Now I'm older the more relevant issue would be who'll figure in his dreams when they are married? Thankfully Hollywood and Jane Austen are not worried about matters connected to mundane reality.
