His mother's father (played brilliantly by Michael Ansara) with hatred of Native Americans is a bitter pill for Seth (played equally brilliantly by T.J. Lowther) to swallow, now that he knows he is half Indian on his war hero deceased father's side. Plus, adjusting to farm work when you have a tendency to daydream can have it's pitfalls as Seth soon finds out.Seth's grandmother is a wonderful, sweet character with one of the film's greatest lines (regarding flowers) and just thrilled to be able to have Seth live with them despite her husband's protestations. A girl his age from the farm down the road provides Seth with more to do than back-breaking chores by teaching him to ride a horse, much to the dismay of his grandfather at first. A nearby Indian farmer holds secrets to Seth's past that won't exactly be a surprise to the average viewer, but how the secrets are delivered over the course of the film is a credit to the filmmakers' ability to hook you with interesting plot development and weave a proper web of a yarn.The Long Road Home is a sensational film filled with life lessons and a truly heartfelt story that quickly endears you to the characters and is entertaining and satisfying to the last frame of it's great finale. It is a rare thing to find such an excellent modern family film (it's from 1999) with so much heart and beauty. It is indeed a long road home for Seth and his grandpa, but a more satisfying journey is difficult to find. You're going to want to watch this one and recommend it a LOT. 5++ stars",5,Taking the long road home is terrific with this film,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,1709,"['Taking', 'place', '1977', 'city', 'boy', 'active', 'imagination', 'strong', 'dose', 'reality', 'when', 'mother', 'away', 'live', 'grandparents', 'farm', 'mother', 'father', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Michael', 'Ansara', 'hatred', 'Native', 'Americans', 'bitter', 'pill', 'Seth', 'played', 'equally', 'brilliantly', 'T.J.', 'Lowther', 'swallow', 'now', 'half', 'Indian', 'war', 'hero', 'deceased', 'father', 'side', 'adjusting', 'farm', 'work', 'when', 'have', 'tendency', 'daydream', 'can', 'have', 'pitfalls', 'Seth', 'soon', 'grandmother', 'wonderful', 'sweet', 'character', 'one', 'film', 'greatest', 'lines', 'regarding', 'flowers', 'just', 'thrilled', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'Seth', 'live', 'husband', 'protestations', 'girl', 'age', 'farm', 'down', 'road', 'Seth', 'more', 'do', 'back-breaking', 'chores', 'teaching', 'ride', 'horse', 'much', 'dismay', 'grandfather', 'first', 'nearby', 'Indian', 'farmer', 'secrets', 'Seth', 'past', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'be', 'surprise', 'average', 'viewer', 'how', 'secrets', 'are', 'delivered', 'course', 'film', 'credit', 'filmmakers', 'ability', 'hook', 'interesting', 'plot', 'development', 'weave', 'proper', 'web', 'yarn.The', 'Long', 'Road', 'Home', 'sensational', 'film', 'filled', 'life', 'lessons', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'quickly', 'characters', 'entertaining', 'satisfying', 'last', 'frame', 'great', 'finale', 'rare', 'thing', 'find', 'such', 'excellent', 'modern', 'family', 'film', '1999', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'beauty', 'indeed', 'long', 'road', 'home', 'Seth', 'grandpa', 'more', 'satisfying', 'journey', 'difficult', 'find', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'recommend', 'LOT', '5++', 'stars']",Long Road Home
