Anne Wheeler does a wonderful job in capturing the beauty of the Canadian Wilderness in the 1800's.  The acting in this movie is superb.  Caroline Dhavernas, who plays Annie Herron, is an amazing talent and her performance in this film was wonderful.  The violence in this film was tastefully done, if that is even possible.  Brendan Fehr, who plays Annie's angry and abusive husband, did an excellent job.  You really dislike this guy and want him to suffer the way he makes those around him suffer.  I am from the U.S. and knew nothing about this film or the short story it was adapted from until I started researching the work of Caroline Dhavernas.  I recommend this film, it's beautifully put together.",4,Beautiful Film,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,788,"['just', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'amazed', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'directing', 'Anne', 'Wheeler', 'wonderful', 'job', 'capturing', 'beauty', 'Canadian', 'Wilderness', '1800', 'acting', 'movie', 'superb', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'who', 'Annie', 'Herron', 'amazing', 'talent', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'wonderful', 'violence', 'film', 'was', 'tastefully', 'done', 'even', 'possible', 'Brendan', 'Fehr', 'who', 'Annie', 'angry', 'abusive', 'husband', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'really', 'dislike', 'guy', 'want', 'suffer', 'way', 'suffer', 'am', 'U.S.', 'knew', 'nothing', 'film', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'adapted', 'started', 'researching', 'work', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'recommend', 'film', 'beautifully', 'put', 'together']",Edge Of Madness

I would submit that the situation of Anne in this movie would certainly have been more the exception than the rule, however.  [More common would be the situation found in the 'Love Comes Softly' series of six movies, most directed by Michael Landon.]  What isn't explained is, when her husband is killed in a hunting accident (at least that is what the dead man's brother claimed), why they would try to cover up the death.  Even more mysterious is why, later in the winter, would Anne trudge through the 40-below snow to 'confess' to his death at the fort?  It makes for a mystifying story worth watching, however.  But, I would still say that the main value of the film is the glimpse it gives of life at the edge of the frontier.",4,A Better Period Piece than Story,1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,914,"['movie', '16-year-old', ""'mail"", 'order', 'bride', 'probably', 'best', 'aspect', 'idea', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'Manitoba', 'middle', '19th', 'Century', 'would', 'submit', 'situation', 'Anne', 'movie', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'exception', 'rule', 'however', '[', 'More', 'common', 'would', 'be', 'situation', 'found', ""'Love"", 'Comes', 'Softly', 'series', 'six', 'movies', 'most', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Landon', ']', 'What', ""n't"", 'explained', 'when', 'husband', 'killed', 'hunting', 'accident', 'least', 'what', 'dead', 'man', 'brother', 'claimed', 'why', 'would', 'try', 'cover', 'up', 'death', 'Even', 'more', 'mysterious', 'why', 'later', 'winter', 'would', 'Anne', 'trudge', '40-below', 'snow', ""'confess"", 'death', 'fort', 'mystifying', 'story', 'watching', 'however', 'would', 'still', 'say', 'main', 'value', 'film', 'glimpse', 'life', 'edge', 'frontier']",Edge Of Madness

Like another reviewer I only came upon this film after looking into the work of Caroline Dhavernas, a tremendously beautiful and talented actress largely (and sadly) unknown to US audiences. The cinematography of the Canadian wilderness and gritty realism of the settlements bring to life the hostility of the Canadian frontier. The violence is disturbing, but in context, and excellently portrayed. Brendan Frehr is both believable and despicable as the tormentor of Dhavernas' character, and Anne Wheeler did an outstanding job directing the talented young cast in such a challenging environment.Having become familiar with Dhavernas through Wonderfalls, this film brought to light the breadth of her acting range and I hope to see her in more projects in the US.",4,A gem of a sleeper,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,814,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'US', 'reviewer', 'only', 'came', 'film', 'looking', 'work', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'tremendously', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'actress', 'largely', 'sadly', 'unknown', 'US', 'audiences', 'cinematography', 'Canadian', 'wilderness', 'gritty', 'realism', 'settlements', 'bring', 'life', 'hostility', 'Canadian', 'frontier', 'violence', 'disturbing', 'context', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'Brendan', 'Frehr', 'believable', 'despicable', 'tormentor', 'Dhavernas', 'character', 'Anne', 'Wheeler', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'directing', 'talented', 'young', 'cast', 'challenging', 'environment.Having', 'become', 'familiar', 'Dhavernas', 'Wonderfalls', 'film', 'brought', 'light', 'breadth', 'acting', 'range', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'projects', 'US']",Edge Of Madness
726110,A134TLRMMNP8IL,B00007AJFV,"F. P. Dunbar ""Renaissance Man""","[1, 1]",I bought this DVD on Amazon. Gloomy and dark even outdoors. Lights shut off when beautiful Cory Sevier takes a bath. No Hollywood flash; it's Canadian! Flash of light would have helped greatly. I had to turn up the brightness on my TV to see anything. Love Sevier and Fehr. Plot drags especially with constant flashbacks. I didn't notice any violence to speak of. I did not get the impression that Annie went mad; she certainly did not act as such. She had a right to be upset about being abandoned in the wilderness by her brother-in-law/lover. Everything is implausibly resolved in a big rush in the last four minutes; it's too much of a contrast with the preceding plodding slow motion. It's as though they were running out of film or steam or maybe money. They ran out of light a long time prior. Unanswered questions: Whom did George marry and why? Why did  he abandon Annie? How was she supposed to survive alone in the wilderness? How did she know that the baby was George's? Who was Sadie? Her pregnancy was just thrown in for sympathy.

726111,A1RMWCN45F0PF9,B00007AJFV,"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven""","[11, 11]","What must it have been like in the mid-1800's homesteading the Canadian plains for a young woman in a marriage of convenience to a brutish husband, when the accents mingled curiously? I think I have acquired a sense of that because of the authentic texture the film-makers gave to this frontier setting.The story is presented in the form of a mystery, altho the resolution is pretty easy to anticipate. It's the characters and situations we meet along the way, their interaction, their sensibilities, that move the story. But at a languid pace, like the times--when commuting was measured in hours and days.The resilient young woman is at the center of two plots and her determination is made plausible by the immensely talented Caroline Dhavernas, and palatable with her offbeat beauty and lovely French-Canadian accent. The other actors acquit themselves well, even the normally amateurish Brendan Fehr. But only the direction (by Anne Wheeler) and photography contribute as much as Dhavernas does.Not a great film, but fascinating if you want atmosphere, and a glimpse of a different era, and plenty of glimpses of a nude Dhavernas.",4,"If you can't beat Hollywood at CGI, beat 'em at realism.",1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,1135,"['What', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'mid-1800', 'homesteading', 'Canadian', 'plains', 'young', 'woman', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'brutish', 'husband', 'when', 'accents', 'mingled', 'curiously', 'think', 'have', 'acquired', 'sense', 'authentic', 'texture', 'film-makers', 'gave', 'frontier', 'setting.The', 'story', 'presented', 'form', 'mystery', 'resolution', 'pretty', 'easy', 'anticipate', 'characters', 'situations', 'meet', 'way', 'interaction', 'sensibilities', 'move', 'story', 'languid', 'pace', 'times', 'when', 'commuting', 'was', 'measured', 'hours', 'days.The', 'resilient', 'young', 'woman', 'center', 'two', 'plots', 'determination', 'made', 'plausible', 'immensely', 'talented', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'palatable', 'offbeat', 'beauty', 'lovely', 'French-Canadian', 'accent', 'other', 'actors', 'acquit', 'well', 'even', 'normally', 'amateurish', 'Brendan', 'Fehr', 'only', 'direction', 'Anne', 'Wheeler', 'contribute', 'as', 'much', 'Dhavernas', 'great', 'film', 'fascinating', 'want', 'atmosphere', 'glimpse', 'different', 'era', 'plenty', 'glimpses', 'nude', 'Dhavernas']",Edge Of Madness

His permanently-angered portrayal of an unloving, uncaring, yet extremely hard-working husband out in the wilderness of yore is an acting talent at its most recent finest. Anne Wheeler as the unlucky youthful new bride is quite brilliant also and as the film gently slides back and forth through a series of flashbacks, you slowly get to realize that she too has undertaken a sizeable role here and come up trumps also. Slow in places, yet scenic at all times, the acting is outstanding and the resulting conclusion - although hardly disguised - is at least one that leaves you without regret.
