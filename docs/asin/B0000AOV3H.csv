A lot of the main characters have been placed into a high school setting, with Prof. X and Wolverine being the only ""adults"" (along with Mystique and Magneto).  While no major menacing bad guys are present, just teen-age high school versions of established characters; Toad, Blob, Avalanche.I think this show is great, and wish the studio would put more time into this series, and re-release the first and second seasons as offical complete seasons (like season 3), and will finish releasing the rest of the series with season 4.",5,Wish the studio would release this as an official complete full Season,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,632,"['Great', 'show', 'lot', 'different', 'previous', 'X-Men', 'animated', 'series', 'comics', 'matter', 'lot', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'placed', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'Prof.', 'X', 'Wolverine', 'being', 'only', 'adults', 'Mystique', 'Magneto', 'major', 'menacing', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'present', 'just', 'teen-age', 'high', 'school', 'versions', 'established', 'characters', 'Toad', 'Blob', 'Avalanche.I', 'think', 'show', 'great', 'wish', 'studio', 'would', 'put', 'more', 'time', 'series', 're-release', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'offical', 'complete', 'seasons', 'season', '3', 'will', 'finish', 'releasing', 'rest', 'series', 'season', '4']",N/A

765144,A26SETBCV5S2FI,B0000AOV3H,eric-tiger,"[5, 13]","Any ""traditional"" X-men fan over 25 will be disappointed with X-men Evolution.  Fans who did not grow up reading the X-men comics or cherishing the original X-men Animated Series may like it, (people under 15) but these fans are not the hard core base of X-men fans to which I refer.So many bad ideas went into this Evolution series.  First of all, I can't get past the ridiculous notion of the X-men attending the local public high school! (And with Mystique as the principal?)The X-men's school was the Xavier School for the Gifted - Period!In addition to that, the idea of the ""good"" mutants going to this same high school as the ""bad"" mutants is just plain stupid.  They were mortal enemies, and no way could they co-exist in the same school, even with the conflicts that happen in these stories.Furthermore, the introduction, at this early stage of the X-men story-line, of characters like Nightcrawler, (whose depiction in this series stinks,) Rogue, (who is portrayed like some punk Gothic chick) and the new mutants is just not the way it happened nor should it happen even in a revised edition like this.  I can handle Storm and Wolverine as early mentors, because they are supposed to be older like they are shown to be here, but the others were just not in existence at this stage of X-men history.  Ice Man and Beast were supposed to be there from the beginning just like Cyclops and Jean.  The Angel, who was my favorite, was another original member of the team, but he doesn't make his appearance until later seasons.And since when were the twins, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch enemies as they were portrayed here?  They were supposed to be as close as any brother/sister twins could ever be.  Pietro was always supposed to be defending his sister to the end.  He was never terrified of her. And what's with this show making Wanda so super powerful like that?  She wasn't so super-mighty as portrayed here.Lastly, I must criticize the art because it is just hard to look at.  I know they are going for a stylized look like in some of the comics, but, like another critic observed, the noses are just plain bad. And the huge feet bother me as well.If YOU like it just because it is something on the X-men being done, that's great, I suppose it is better than nothing.But for me the original series in the 90s, (yes, that means the original ""series"") was far superior, (I don't understand how anyone could criticize the art in that show.  In my view the art in many of those original series episodes rivaled even the best of Disney, especially ""The Phoenix Saga"", and the ""Dark Phoenix Saga"", as well as many more: beautiful art!)Sadly, what we have now in ""Evolution"" is some Hollywood executive's vision of a revised X-men universe, targeting today's bubble gum brigade, (ie: the high school setting, Spyke and his skateboard.)  Hollywood has always thought they know better than the creators of the genre, but usually, like in this case, it only results in a bastardization of what so many of us grew up loving.",1,X-men for the Bubble Gum Brigade,1071100800,"12 11, 2003",2003,3030,"['traditional', 'X-men', 'fan', '25', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'X-men', 'Evolution', 'Fans', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'reading', 'X-men', 'comics', 'cherishing', 'original', 'X-men', 'Animated', 'Series', 'may', 'like', 'people', '15', 'fans', 'are', 'not', 'hard', 'core', 'base', 'X-men', 'fans', 'refer.So', 'many', 'bad', 'ideas', 'went', 'Evolution', 'series', 'First', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'ridiculous', 'notion', 'X-men', 'attending', 'local', 'public', 'high', 'school', 'Mystique', 'principal', 'X-men', 'school', 'was', 'Xavier', 'School', 'Gifted', 'Period', 'addition', 'idea', 'good', 'mutants', 'going', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'bad', 'mutants', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'were', 'mortal', 'enemies', 'way', 'could', 'co-exist', 'same', 'school', 'even', 'conflicts', 'happen', 'stories.Furthermore', 'introduction', 'early', 'stage', 'X-men', 'story-line', 'characters', 'Nightcrawler', 'depiction', 'series', 'Rogue', 'who', 'portrayed', 'punk', 'Gothic', 'chick', 'new', 'mutants', 'just', 'not', 'way', 'happened', 'should', 'happen', 'even', 'revised', 'edition', 'can', 'handle', 'Storm', 'Wolverine', 'early', 'mentors', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'older', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'here', 'others', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'existence', 'stage', 'X-men', 'history', 'Ice', 'Man', 'Beast', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'beginning', 'just', 'Cyclops', 'Jean', 'Angel', 'who', 'was', 'favorite', 'was', 'original', 'member', 'team', ""n't"", 'make', 'appearance', 'later', 'seasons.And', 'when', 'were', 'twins', 'Quicksilver', 'Scarlet', 'Witch', 'enemies', 'were', 'portrayed', 'here', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'as', 'close', 'brother/sister', 'twins', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'Pietro', 'was', 'always', 'supposed', 'be', 'defending', 'sister', 'end', 'was', 'never', 'terrified', 'what', 'show', 'making', 'Wanda', 'so', 'super', 'powerful', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'super-mighty', 'portrayed', 'here.Lastly', 'must', 'criticize', 'art', 'just', 'hard', 'look', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'stylized', 'look', 'comics', 'critic', 'observed', 'noses', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'huge', 'feet', 'bother', 'well.If', 'just', 'something', 'X-men', 'being', 'done', 'great', 'suppose', 'better', 'nothing.But', 'original', 'series', '90s', 'yes', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'criticize', 'art', 'show', 'view', 'art', 'many', 'original', 'series', 'episodes', 'rivaled', 'even', 'best', 'Disney', 'especially', 'Phoenix', 'Saga', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'Saga', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'more', 'beautiful', 'art', 'Sadly', 'what', 'have', 'now', 'Evolution', 'Hollywood', 'executive', 'vision', 'revised', 'X-men', 'universe', 'targeting', 'today', 'bubble', 'gum', 'brigade', 'ie', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'Spyke', 'skateboard', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'thought', 'know', 'better', 'creators', 'genre', 'usually', 'case', 'only', 'results', 'bastardization', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'grew', 'up', 'loving']",N/A

Like many kids' shows it's actually pretty dumb, with uninspired writing and voice acting (with the exception of Scott/Cyclops; Kirby Morrow does a good job with him); the animation quality isn't great, either.  However I kept at it with a sense of nostalgia, and soon came to realize that I still enjoyed it, mostly because of the Kurt/Nightcrawler character and the animation style, as well as the high school setting and the way the characters get to try out different scenarios.Even though the movements and lip-synching are off, I do like how the drawings look a lot like anime, which shouldn't be a surprise considering all the Japanese names in the credits.  In any case, Kurt's personality alone was enough to make me satisfied with my purchase.  I like the Brotherhood, too; Lance is cool, Pietro is delightfully aggravating, and Toad is hilarious.  I like that the show's creators decided to see what it was like to make most of the X-Men teenagers.  Magneto's a stock villain disappointment, though; he has absolutely none of the depth that Ian McKellen brought to the character in the X-Men films.So thumbs up if you enjoyed this show as a kid or are interested in anime-inspired cartoons, but hardcore X-Men fans probably won't like it.",4,Anime-style X-Men,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,1340,"['used', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'recently', 'decided', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'many', 'kids', 'shows', 'actually', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'uninspired', 'writing', 'voice', 'acting', 'exception', 'Scott/Cyclops', 'Kirby', 'Morrow', 'good', 'job', 'animation', 'quality', ""n't"", 'great', 'either', 'However', 'kept', 'sense', 'nostalgia', 'soon', 'came', 'realize', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'mostly', 'Kurt/Nightcrawler', 'character', 'animation', 'style', 'as', 'well', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'way', 'characters', 'get', 'try', 'out', 'different', 'scenarios.Even', 'movements', 'lip-synching', 'are', 'do', 'how', 'drawings', 'look', 'lot', 'anime', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', 'considering', 'Japanese', 'names', 'credits', 'case', 'Kurt', 'personality', 'alone', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'satisfied', 'purchase', 'Brotherhood', 'too', 'Lance', 'cool', 'Pietro', 'delightfully', 'aggravating', 'Toad', 'hilarious', 'like', 'show', 'creators', 'decided', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'make', 'most', 'X-Men', 'teenagers', 'Magneto', 'stock', 'villain', 'disappointment', 'though', 'absolutely', 'none', 'depth', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'brought', 'character', 'X-Men', 'films.So', 'up', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'kid', 'are', 'interested', 'anime-inspired', 'cartoons', 'hardcore', 'X-Men', 'fans', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like']",N/A

Many longtime fans didn't find the series too likeable because of the way it is presented, and X-Men: Evolution doesn't hold a candle to the early 90's Fox show.  Nightcrawler's characterization is terrible, and there's too much teenie bopper type mellow drama going on with high school kids.  The animation is decent, but it's not as gritty as the Fox series.

765152,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0000AOV3H,P. Hardy,"[7, 17]","If anything media-related can be said about X-men Evolution, it was created because of the success of the X-men movie released in 2000. That said, X-men Evolution is sort of a retelling of the X-men story, with a totally different twist to it; A majority of the X-men are teenagers. That's right teenagers, minus Wolverine as their trainer and baby-sitter most of the time, Xavier as the head of the Xavier institute, and Storm (as their teacher) which was strange for me at first but then again who want to see a teenage-angst ridden Wolverine or Storm?Anyway, the first episode starts off with introducing Rouge; an isolated teenage girl with problems who somehow ends up the target of Mystique and Magneto. Naturally the teenage-X-men (accompanied by Wolverine) head out to try and to help her while at the same time stop her from hurting herself or others unaware that Mystique is two-steps ahead of them. From there the fairly moderate episodes and plot progresses revealing a little more about what in fact is happening in the show. Why Magneto has with a bunch of misguided teenagers recruited for his ""Brotherhood"" (Toad; equipped with his own theme, Avalanche, the Blob, and Quicksilver) is beyond me.The animations for the show is done quite good, the characters move with fluid motions with the occasional stiffness, the drawings are somewhat blocky/square, the voice-acting is okay (I was suckered into watching the show because several my favorite voice-actors were featured in the show; Scott McNeil, Kirby Morrow, David Kaye, Mark Hildreth, etc.) and they do get better if not worse as the show progresses.Basically X-men Evolution's only down fall is that majority of the episodes are a mishmash of the good guys fighting the bad guys with blaring rock music in the background, injuring them only (there are no fatalities) and then letting them escape to fight or rather go to the same high-school with them another day. Which sort of bothered me, because they are supposed to be enemies right? The show is pretty good it can get boring at times, plus it probably won't please veterans of the X-men series, but its a good introduction for new comers and adolescence's alike.",3,Basically X-men Evolution's only down fall is that . . .,1116288000,"05 17, 2005",2005,2190,"['anything', 'media-related', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'X-men', 'Evolution', 'was', 'created', 'success', 'X-men', 'movie', 'released', '2000', 'said', 'X-men', 'Evolution', 'sort', 'retelling', 'X-men', 'story', 'totally', 'different', 'twist', 'majority', 'X-men', 'are', 'teenagers', 'right', 'teenagers', 'Wolverine', 'trainer', 'baby-sitter', 'most', 'time', 'Xavier', 'head', 'Xavier', 'institute', 'Storm', 'teacher', 'was', 'strange', 'first', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'teenage-angst', 'ridden', 'Wolverine', 'Storm', 'Anyway', 'first', 'episode', 'introducing', 'Rouge', 'isolated', 'teenage', 'girl', 'problems', 'who', 'somehow', 'up', 'target', 'Mystique', 'Magneto', 'Naturally', 'teenage-X-men', 'accompanied', 'Wolverine', 'head', 'try', 'help', 'same', 'time', 'stop', 'hurting', 'others', 'unaware', 'Mystique', 'two-steps', 'ahead', 'fairly', 'moderate', 'episodes', 'plot', 'progresses', 'revealing', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'fact', 'happening', 'show', 'Why', 'Magneto', 'bunch', 'misguided', 'teenagers', 'recruited', 'Brotherhood', 'Toad', 'equipped', 'own', 'theme', 'Avalanche', 'Blob', 'Quicksilver', 'me.The', 'animations', 'show', 'done', 'quite', 'good', 'characters', 'move', 'fluid', 'motions', 'occasional', 'stiffness', 'drawings', 'are', 'somewhat', 'blocky/square', 'voice-acting', 'okay', 'was', 'suckered', 'watching', 'show', 'several', 'favorite', 'voice-actors', 'were', 'featured', 'show', 'Scott', 'McNeil', 'Kirby', 'Morrow', 'David', 'Kaye', 'Mark', 'Hildreth', 'etc', 'do', 'get', 'better', 'not', 'worse', 'show', 'progresses.Basically', 'X-men', 'Evolution', 'only', 'down', 'fall', 'majority', 'episodes', 'are', 'mishmash', 'good', 'guys', 'fighting', 'bad', 'guys', 'blaring', 'rock', 'music', 'background', 'injuring', 'only', 'are', 'fatalities', 'then', 'letting', 'escape', 'fight', 'rather', 'go', 'same', 'high-school', 'day', 'Which', 'sort', 'bothered', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'enemies', 'right', 'show', 'pretty', 'good', 'can', 'get', 'boring', 'times', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'please', 'veterans', 'X-men', 'series', 'good', 'introduction', 'new', 'comers', 'adolescence', 'alike']",N/A

765154,AFV2584U13XP3,B0000AOV3H,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]","After seeing this series on cable and online for a couple of years now I finally decided to get most of the series with the exception of season four which hasn't been released on dvd yet,  and like when I first saw the show I find it as enjoyable now as I did than.  The first thing you have to realize is yes the series isn't as hardcore as the previous cartoon series like the one we saw in the 90's and it doesn't hide that fact either the show is more of a variation of the comic series and mixed with the generation kids at the time of its showing,  the series while has some serious situation and story-arc again isn't as hardcore as the 90's version but if you watched the 90's version that one did stick with the comic story more that marvel had out at the time and if you recognize this then this series won't be to problematic for you.  The new way the producers made some of the characters was a nice new way to go like instead of having the X-men as grownups we get to see most of them in their younger high school years with the exception of Professor X, Logan, Storm,  Beast,  Mystique,  and Magneto being the primary adult characters throughout the show.  Like always though you can't have the X-men without some villains to tangle with and the producers have given us a younger group of the brotherhood of mutants to match up against the X-men the primary members being Avalanche, Toad, Blob, and Quicksilver though later on we have Wanda also known as the Scarlet witch making her debut in the next season.  The one thing is if you haven't read some of the X-men comics or anything about the story itself some of what's going on may confuse you and though the producers do a good job of explaining some of what's going on it does help of you read the comic books and now the story of the Marvel universe X-men.  Also a minor point if anyone is a big time anime fan like myself another big plus is the voice cast are done by mostly anime voice actors/actresses we've heard in past anime series from Inu Yasha to Gundam Seed and Gundam Wing all great in their roles and fantastic to hear while they do their character roles.  So is the series worth getting for X-men fans out there?,  I say a definite yes while it doesn't follow the comic version to the letter the cartoon series itself is so entertaining and enjoyable to watch that I think any X-man fan out there will easily forgive this.",5,A Very Enjoyable Series For Any X-men Fan Out There,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,2407,"['seeing', 'series', 'cable', 'online', 'couple', 'years', 'now', 'finally', 'decided', 'get', 'most', 'series', 'exception', 'season', 'four', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'dvd', 'yet', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'show', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'now', 'did', 'first', 'thing', 'have', 'realize', 'series', ""n't"", 'as', 'hardcore', 'previous', 'cartoon', 'series', 'one', 'saw', '90', ""n't"", 'hide', 'fact', 'show', 'more', 'variation', 'comic', 'series', 'mixed', 'generation', 'kids', 'time', 'showing', 'series', 'while', 'serious', 'situation', 'story-arc', 'again', ""n't"", 'as', 'hardcore', '90', 'version', 'watched', '90', 'version', 'one', 'did', 'stick', 'comic', 'story', 'more', 'marvel', 'had', 'out', 'time', 'recognize', 'then', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'problematic', 'new', 'way', 'producers', 'made', 'characters', 'was', 'nice', 'new', 'way', 'go', 'instead', 'having', 'X-men', 'grownups', 'get', 'see', 'most', 'younger', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'exception', 'Professor', 'X', 'Logan', 'Storm', 'Beast', 'Mystique', 'Magneto', 'being', 'primary', 'adult', 'characters', 'show', 'always', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'X-men', 'villains', 'tangle', 'producers', 'have', 'given', 'younger', 'group', 'brotherhood', 'mutants', 'match', 'up', 'X-men', 'primary', 'members', 'being', 'Avalanche', 'Toad', 'Blob', 'Quicksilver', 'later', 'have', 'Wanda', 'also', 'known', 'Scarlet', 'witch', 'making', 'debut', 'next', 'season', 'one', 'thing', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'X-men', 'comics', 'anything', 'story', 'what', 'going', 'may', 'confuse', 'producers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'what', 'going', 'help', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'now', 'story', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'X-men', 'Also', 'minor', 'point', 'anyone', 'big', 'time', 'anime', 'fan', 'big', 'plus', 'voice', 'cast', 'are', 'done', 'mostly', 'anime', 'voice', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'past', 'anime', 'series', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'Gundam', 'Seed', 'Gundam', 'Wing', 'great', 'roles', 'fantastic', 'hear', 'do', 'character', 'roles', 'So', 'series', 'getting', 'X-men', 'fans', 'there', 'say', 'definite', 'yes', ""n't"", 'follow', 'comic', 'version', 'letter', 'cartoon', 'series', 'so', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'think', 'X-man', 'fan', 'there', 'will', 'easily', 'forgive']",N/A
765155,A2GXV3SMUHB7GB,B0000AOV3H,"rogueshadowcrawler ""Rogue""","[3, 3]","Disclaimer: First of all, if you are a die-hard X-Men comic purist, this show is not for you. I say this because X-Men: Evolution is about a group of teenage mutants who are fighting to be accepted and finding their place in the world...all during high school. It's not anything like most of the comics except for the characters' names and powers, so anyone who will be annoyed by that might as well not bother because it will just end up making them mad.This show, after the three X-Men movies, was one of my first introductions to these characters, and no doubt I wouldn't have become quite so interested in the comics without it. A friend of mine gave me a link to watch the entire show online, and, being curious, I decided to give it a shot. In the first three episodes I was reintroduced to Cyclops, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Rogue, and Shadowcat in a slightly different form than I was used to, but I was instantly hooked. The driving force behind the first season is a mysterious villain who is working with the principal of Bayville High - where the young X-Men attend regular high school - for reasons unknown. (Of course, if you've seen the movies or know anything at all about the X-Men's villains, you'll be able to figure it out easily...but it makes for good suspense anyway.) There are occasionally cheesy moments (well, it IS a kid's TV show!) and moments where the animation is a bit off, but overall this is one of the best animated shows I have ever had the pleasure to watch. And it just keeps getting better and better each season. It's a terrible pity that they're too stingy to let us have Season 4 on DVD, though...it delved into darker and more emotional moments than I've ever seen in a kids' TV show.",5,Entertaining for fans and non-fans alike,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,1727,"['Disclaimer', 'First', 'all', 'are', 'die-hard', 'X-Men', 'comic', 'purist', 'show', 'not', 'say', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'group', 'teenage', 'mutants', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'be', 'accepted', 'finding', 'place', 'world', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'anything', 'most', 'comics', 'characters', 'names', 'powers', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'annoyed', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'bother', 'will', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'mad.This', 'show', 'three', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'introductions', 'characters', 'doubt', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'become', 'quite', 'so', 'interested', 'comics', 'friend', 'mine', 'gave', 'link', 'watch', 'entire', 'show', 'online', 'being', 'curious', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'was', 'reintroduced', 'Cyclops', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Nightcrawler', 'Rogue', 'Shadowcat', 'slightly', 'different', 'form', 'was', 'used', 'was', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'driving', 'force', 'first', 'season', 'mysterious', 'villain', 'who', 'working', 'principal', 'Bayville', 'High', 'where', 'young', 'X-Men', 'attend', 'regular', 'high', 'school', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'course', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'know', 'anything', 'X-Men', 'villains', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'easily', 'good', 'suspense', 'anyway', 'are', 'occasionally', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'well', 'kid', 'TV', 'show', 'moments', 'where', 'animation', 'bit', 'off', 'overall', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'season', 'terrible', 'pity', ""'re"", 'too', 'stingy', 'let', 'have', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'delved', 'darker', 'more', 'emotional', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'kids', 'TV', 'show']",N/A
765156,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B0000AOV3H,Scott,"[10, 13]","Many of the reviews here comment on the poor quality of the animation in this series.  While the animation isn't as great as something like ""Justice League,"" it works for the series, and the storylines more than make up for it.  I never thought the animation was poor, and it looked like any other superhero cartoon to me.Although I have never seen the original X-Men cartoon, I don't think it's fair to compare the two.  ""Evolution"" focuses on the origins of the X-Men, and while not entirely true to the comic book, it makes for some great stories.  The writing on it is incredible.  The characters are very well developed.  Over the first 4 or 5 episodes, Scott Summers and Jean Grey's relationship is developed even moreso than in the current X-Men films.  This holds true for all the characters, and doesn't limit the amount of action in the series.  However the show does focus a bit more on the inter-relationships of the mutants than on the whole ""Good Mutant vs. Evil Mutant"" concept.  And that's what makes the series so great.As far as the DVD goes, it contains solely the first season, with no extras, which is unfortunate.  There's no real enticement for buying this set over simply watching the series (if it's still available in yor area).  But if you have missed some episodes or have seen the series out of order, I definately recommend starting here.  Unlike many cartoons, this show follows a storyline that makes more sense if you see the episodes in the order they were originally shown.",5,An excellent set,1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,1508,"['Many', 'reviews', 'here', 'comment', 'poor', 'quality', 'animation', 'series', 'animation', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'something', 'Justice', 'League', 'series', 'storylines', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'never', 'thought', 'animation', 'was', 'poor', 'looked', 'other', 'superhero', 'cartoon', 'me.Although', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'X-Men', 'cartoon', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'compare', 'two', 'Evolution', 'focuses', 'origins', 'X-Men', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'great', 'stories', 'writing', 'incredible', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'first', '4', '5', 'episodes', 'Scott', 'Summers', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'relationship', 'developed', 'even', 'moreso', 'current', 'X-Men', 'films', 'true', 'characters', ""n't"", 'limit', 'amount', 'action', 'series', 'However', 'show', 'focus', 'bit', 'more', 'inter-relationships', 'mutants', 'whole', 'Good', 'Mutant', 'vs', 'Evil', 'Mutant', 'concept', 'what', 'series', 'so', 'great.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'solely', 'first', 'season', 'extras', 'unfortunate', 'real', 'enticement', 'buying', 'set', 'simply', 'watching', 'series', 'still', 'available', 'yor', 'area', 'have', 'missed', 'episodes', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'order', 'definately', 'recommend', 'starting', 'here', 'many', 'cartoons', 'show', 'storyline', 'more', 'sense', 'see', 'episodes', 'order', 'were', 'originally', 'shown']",N/A
