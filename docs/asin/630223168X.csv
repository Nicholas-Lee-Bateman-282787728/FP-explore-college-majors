I was fascinated with the Charles Addams cartoons I found in the New Yorker magazine on which this breakthrough sit-com was based. TV families of the day (Father Knows Best, Leave It To Beaver, The Donna Reed Show, Ozzie and Harriet) all put the emphasis on conformity to being ""normal"" but at times were just too perfect to relate to. Finally we had a rather anti-normal family who appeared bizarre on the outside, but who still cared for eachother and even helped the neighborhood that rejected them. And the passion between Morticia and Gomez added some romantic excitement never seen by TV couples.

The show may appear to be about a strange Halloween type family. But just how strange are they?This show was made in the 60s, when people were being exposed to different lifestyles. And yes.

Gomez and Morticia have dark senses of humor; Wednesday is almost always depressed; Uncle Fester likes torture devices; Lurch barely speaks; and of course the additional servant (or pet) is a hand without a body. (Thing)But what makes this show is that the Addamses ARE A FUNCTIONAL FAMILY. Gomez and Morticia love each other; they love their children; they stand by each other; and even the extended family members (Uncle Fester) and the servant (Lurch) are treated with love and kindness. The differences for the most part are just external. (Not internal!)Some especially great episodes are when Gomez and his family try to help Sam Hilliard get elected, Wednesday runs away from home, and the Addames do what they can to bring her home, when Gomez, Morticia, and Fester decide to bet on the horse races so they can win enough money to go to the moon, and the one where the Addames all go to court to save Ma ma.Overall it's an enjoyable show with Halloween charm, but touching messages about how a family holds together through love and support.",4,Deeper Than We Might Think,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,1362,"['interesting', 'show', 'much', 'deeper', 'show', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'strange', 'Halloween', 'type', 'family', 'just', 'how', 'strange', 'are', 'show', 'was', 'made', '60s', 'when', 'people', 'were', 'being', 'exposed', 'different', 'lifestyles', 'yes', 'ways', 'Addams', 'Family', 'very', 'different', 'Gomez', 'Morticia', 'have', 'dark', 'senses', 'humor', 'Wednesday', 'almost', 'always', 'depressed', 'Uncle', 'Fester', 'torture', 'devices', 'Lurch', 'barely', 'course', 'additional', 'servant', 'pet', 'hand', 'body', 'Thing', 'what', 'show', 'Addamses', 'ARE', 'A', 'FUNCTIONAL', 'FAMILY', 'Gomez', 'Morticia', 'love', 'other', 'love', 'children', 'stand', 'other', 'even', 'extended', 'family', 'members', 'Uncle', 'Fester', 'servant', 'Lurch', 'are', 'treated', 'love', 'kindness', 'differences', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'just', 'external', 'Not', 'internal', 'especially', 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'when', 'Gomez', 'family', 'try', 'help', 'Sam', 'Hilliard', 'get', 'elected', 'Wednesday', 'away', 'home', 'Addames', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'bring', 'home', 'when', 'Gomez', 'Morticia', 'Fester', 'decide', 'bet', 'horse', 'races', 'can', 'win', 'enough', 'money', 'go', 'moon', 'one', 'where', 'Addames', 'go', 'court', 'save', 'Ma', 'ma.Overall', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'Halloween', 'charm', 'touching', 'messages', 'how', 'family', 'together', 'love', 'support']","Addams Family, Vol. 3 VHS"
302919,A1S3C5OFU508P3,630223168X,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","I was not a fan of ""The Addams Family"" television show when I was young; I considered the characters and plots to be simplistic. However, as I aged and learned more about comedy and television, I grew to appreciate it. In watching this tape I was impressed by the use of lighting and the B&W; coloring of the shooting. It was a stroke of genius how the directors were able to portray the impression of morbidity through the shades of gray. This is clearly one storyline that would lose much of the power if it were ever to be colorized.In ""The Addams Family Tree"" Pugsley and Wednesday attend a neighbor boy's birthday party and turn it into a disaster. The neighbor man is very snooty, considering his family to be superior in ""breeding"" to all others. This prompts Gomez and Morticia to hire a genealogist to research the Addams family tree and that of the neighbors and Gomez and Morticia are impressed with the scoundrels in the neighbor's ancestry. They agree that their neighbors have a superior genealogy due to the many evildoers that they can claim.""Gomez, the Politician"" opens with Gomez hanging a political sign on his steel fence and then sharpening one of the points. A worker for another candidate walks by and tries to convince Gomez that his candidate is superior. When Gomez learns that the other candidate wants to drain the bogs he immediately switches sides. Morticia is horrified to learn this but Gomez assures her that politicians always do the opposite of their promises so this is a way to guarantee that the bogs will remain.The entire Addams family then begins working for the candidate, but their tactics are a disaster for him. This episode contains many funny moments of political satire; politics does indeed make strange bedfellows. I also found the movements of Morticia to be amusing, her walk is a thing of sinister beauty.

Nearly anyone over the age of 50 will recogize the finger snapping music and know at least somethine about Thing, Lurch, Cousin  IT, Uncle Fester, etc.And, of course, we also have the orginial comics from an earlier time!The pictue was, if anything, better than originally shown - it's hard to tell because of the differences in technology, etc. Sound was as good as it's going to be.

We are unlikely to see such eccentric, subversive, and downright bizarre humor ever again on the small screen. It's about time the series become available on DVD, but there are some issues with this particular release. MGM appears to be trying to stretch out the two seasons of the show into three DVD packages, because there are just 22 episodes here, while each broadcast season had more than 30. Two larger releases would be more efficient and less expensive than three smaller releases. Meanwhile, the bonus features here are weak, with a few amateurish documentaries that are not nearly as robust as faithful fans deserve. The worst is the documentary on the actors, which provides absolutely no information on Jackie Coogan, Ted Cassidy, or Blossom Rock, while giving too much space to Felix Silla (who only appeared sporadically as Cousin Itt). John Astin, Lisa Loring, and Ken Weatherwax are given plenty of room, and well-deserved respect is given to Carolyn Jones. But if this documentary was able to cover some of the show's actors, it could have continued with coverage of everybody.But my belly-aching above is about a modern DVD package. In the end, that stuff is far less important than the episodes, which are still as uproarious today as they were offbeat during their original TV run. This is quality TV for the thinking goofball. The best thing about the show is how it sends up stereotypes of the happy nuclear family via a group of eccentric weirdos. True family values shine through the kooky settings and ooky character developments, which were far more intelligent than standard monster movie fare. This was also the genius of Charles Addams' original works. The funniest thing about the show is how the family thought they were normal, and that everybody else was weird. And finally, if anyone tries to tell me that the darkly elegant and gloomily lovely Carolyn Jones wasn't the sexiest woman ever on television, I'll konk them on the head with an Indian club!

Nickelodeon runs Gilligan's island, Sponge Bob (or is that cartoon network), anyway - NO Addams family! I even wrote Amazon asking if they were EVER going to carry The Addams Family. Of course 3 days later - they did.This is a GREAT collection of the television show's early episodes. It is well organized, with no commercials or other junk to get in the way of your enjoyment, but I do wish they were more clear on the chronology (this is the pilot, this is episode 1,2,3...). I was concerned at first when I first bought it, as it was entitled ""Volume One"" but gave no reference as to how many volumes there would be, or what the total number of episodes would appear on each disc. When I finally got the DVD(s) I was overjoyed to realize that there were in fact 22 episodes and several bonus features (these were not included in the original Amazon listing).With all due respect to Raul Julia and Angelica Houston, John Astin and Carolyn Jones ARE the Addams' and thus my extended family. This really is a must-own classic television series that whose magic has not been captured in the attempted spin-offs and recreations. Arthur Hiller is a genius. I was fortunate enough to meet him when I was eleven. I only wish I knew enough to tell him so then. As to this volume, the value/cost ratio is excellent.

302929,A2L3VK6QQ91ILU,630223168X,Earth that Was,"[1, 2]","""The Addams Family"" Series 1 is a treat. Here's my ""Top 5"".Firstly, this black and white series doesn't date. Monochrome suits the mock macabre world of the Addams. And they are ""ooky and kooky"" enough to be outside of everyone's fashion universe. Where other shows from 1964 seem better in memory than in rerun, the Addams are better. My prediction? The recently produced Addams Family movies will be well and truly out-of-date before the sixties TV series.Secondly the Addams Family was ahead of it's time. Today many series pay lip service to tolerance and diversity. As John Astin mentions in the extras to this disk set, the Addams Family had poked gentle fun at the dividing line between conventional and unconventional. The Addams' have a foot in both camps. Outwardly unconventional they believe themselves to be middle of the road normals. Today we're used to people being ""non-confromists just like everyone else"", our self-styled non-confromists wouldn't last too long around Uncle Fester!Gomez's on screen passion for his wife was, as the extras note, unique in it's time. Another area where the Addams were ahead of the trend. One area they aren't is in simple good manners. Wednesday always (always!) says ""thank you Thing"". How many modern series exhibit children with good manners? Maybe modern series and audiences could learn something here.Thirdly, the video and audio reproduction in this series is very good. With the DVDs you realise just how central Vic Mizzi's excellent music is to the series. Again harpsichord doesn't date. If it's not 'in' it can't go 'out'.Fourth, the extras here are valuable, informative and entertaining. They are not an after thought. It's great to see the surviving cast and how Pugsley and Wednesday have grown up. The extras background the work of Charles Addams, the cartoonist creator of ""The Addams Family"", detail the origin and casting of the series, and showcase the music. Hit it Lurch!Last but not least, the Addams Family is simply fun.

The picture is nicely restored and the sound is clear and full. My only disappointments are They did not include the Unaired Pilot (This is the reason critics praised The Addams over The Munsters whose pilot episode was downright silly. Not the actually series). And on a personal note, after the end credits rolled they omitted Ted Cassidy's powerful baritone voiceover ""THIS HAS BEEN A FILMWAYS PRESENTATION"" unless that was for only some episodes.

302940,A3160YSU1KRL8E,630223168X,Justin Playfair,"[5, 6]","The Addams Family was a slightly more sophisticated 60's comedy that featured eccentric characters carried to the tenth power. The basis of this sit/com is of course Charles Addams' comic strip of a fictional gothic-horror family where the abnormal is normal. Each member of the family has a hobby or interest and their house features perhaps the most interesting collection of unusual props ever to grace the screen. This collection of DVD's is nicely transferred and although it is not a complete season there are plenty of episodes. As usual, each episode focuses on one of the characters. Some of the better ones concern the Addams history of backing losing candidates in elections, where Gomez shows Morticia a collection of presidential loser posters going all the way back to Stephen Douglas (lost to Lincoln) and the first episode sort of makes us familiar with the eccentric props inside the residence. There is a good Halloween story that involves Don Rickles as a Bank Robber. The Addams family is always at home and are generous to a fault when people ask for donations. 5 dollars can become 5 thousand very quickly if you hesitate. When they run out, Gomez simply has the Butler go down to the basement and grab another barrel, in an area full of barrels as far as the eye can distinguish. Good light fun.

Harris ""skytag""","[20, 21]","I'm going to assume that you've seen The Addams Family at some point, so you know what it's about and probably have fond memories of it. Technically this is a great release. The video is top notch and the sound is very good. It's mono, but that's what they had then, and the quality is excellent.I had fond memories of this show, but I think I like it even more than I did when it was broadcast in 1964. John Astin is fabulous as Gomez Addams. I'd forgotten just how amazing he was in this role. In fact, Morticia, Uncle Fester, and Lurch are all played to perfection. One thing that appeals to me now that I probably didn't appreciate as a kid is the fact that these characters are such *nice* people. Gomez and Morticia are still madly in love. Gomez is patient and polite. Morticia is impeccably gracious. The kids are polite and respectful, and they all have a positive attitude about everything, including all the ""weird"" people (as they see them) who show up at their door, with whom they are very patient. Unrealistic? Maybe, but I like happy, friendly, positive people (the real world doesn't have enough of them for my tastes ;-). It amazes me is how well this show holds up. Not only is it funny, but the cast's performances almost make their characters believable.I haven't watched all the extras, but I did listen to the audio commentary for Cousin Itt Visits the Addams Family and it was very well done. The actors all talked about themselves, other cast members, the making of the show, trivia, and pretty much give you exactly what you want in an audio commentary about a show of this type. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Why only four stars for this release? Because:- These are double-sided, single-layer disks. I hate double sided disks (for multiple reasons), and the same amount of material could have fit on the same number of single-sided, dual-layer disks with labels.- They're releasing the two seasons of this show in three volumes. I'd rather have two full-season sets. It would be more cost effective for the studio and seem more natural on my shelf. In fact, I'd have been happy with a single set containing the entire series. Had they used dual-layer disks they could have put the entire series on at most eight disks, which would fit in four of the thinpak cases, and it would be nice to have the entire season in one box that's 1.25"" wide instead of three boxes using over an inch more of my shelf space. (An inch doesn't sound like much, and it isn't if you only have a few seasons of your most favorite show. But if you have a large collection of TV show seasons, it adds up, in which case you hate to see the space just wasted like this.)If they'd released this show in two sets of single-sided disks I'd give it more than five stars.All that said, stop wasting time reading reviews and just order these.

By that I mean 5 to 8 minutes per episode hacked out to make way for excess commercials on Aussie TV.

On the DVD, to my utter surprise, he walks in the gate, walks up a long winding drive to the Addams house, then starts at the sight of Wednesday.I have watched the Addams Family since it came out when I was a child and never knew there was a long, winding path from the street to their house.

302961,AYF7IX9JLHU83,630223168X,"Richard Bellush, Jr.","[0, 0]","TV in the 50s and early 60s was more varied and creative than it often is remembered as having been - think of Playhouse 90, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, One Step Beyond, or the Twilight Zone. However, the sitcom genre was family-friendly with a vengeance: Donna Reed, Leave It to Beaver, Make Room for Daddy, Ozzie and Harriet, and so on. There was and is nothing wrong with shows of this type, except for the fact that these were the only images of domesticity presented in that format.This, like so much else, changed in the mid-60s, and The Addams Family was a part of the change. I loved the show from the first episode, which aired on September 18, 1964, (and, incidentally, I was smitten by the lady in black played by Carolyn Jones the same night). The Addams family poked fun at the standard TV family as much by its resemblance to one as by its deviance. Like the Charles Addams cartoons on which it was based, The Addams Family stood ordinary conventions on their heads; typical was an early episode in which Morticia finds (horrors!) a baseball glove in her son's closet and holds it up at arm's length by two fingers, as appalled as another mother would be by drug paraphernalia. These people were not merely oddballs, they were seriously dangerous, with children who literally played with dynamite, but were utterly likable for all that. They defied social norms along with all the busybody regulations (property, weapons, safety, and the like) to which most of us long have been resigned. The sensual interaction of Morticia and Gomez differed enormously from the behavior other sitcom couples as well. Actually, it still does differ; contemporary shows have much more randy jokes, but that is far from the same thing.The first season on DVD arrived in the mail this week. I've been enjoying it as much as when I was eleven, and I still have a crush on the long haired beauty with the lovely gray pallor.",5,You Rang,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,1917,"['TV', '50s', 'early', '60s', 'was', 'more', 'varied', 'creative', 'often', 'remembered', 'having', 'been', 'think', 'Playhouse', '90', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Presents', 'One', 'Step', 'Beyond', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'However', 'sitcom', 'genre', 'was', 'family-friendly', 'vengeance', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'Make', 'Room', 'Daddy', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'so', 'was', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'shows', 'type', 'fact', 'were', 'only', 'images', 'domesticity', 'presented', 'format.This', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'changed', 'mid-60s', 'Addams', 'Family', 'was', 'part', 'change', 'loved', 'show', 'first', 'episode', 'aired', 'September', '18', '1964', 'incidentally', 'was', 'smitten', 'lady', 'black', 'played', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'same', 'night', 'Addams', 'family', 'poked', 'fun', 'standard', 'TV', 'family', 'much', 'resemblance', 'one', 'deviance', 'Charles', 'Addams', 'cartoons', 'was', 'based', 'Addams', 'Family', 'stood', 'ordinary', 'conventions', 'heads', 'typical', 'was', 'early', 'episode', 'Morticia', 'horrors', 'baseball', 'glove', 'son', 'closet', 'up', 'arm', 'length', 'two', 'fingers', 'as', 'appalled', 'mother', 'would', 'be', 'drug', 'paraphernalia', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'merely', 'oddballs', 'were', 'seriously', 'dangerous', 'children', 'who', 'literally', 'played', 'dynamite', 'were', 'utterly', 'likable', 'defied', 'social', 'norms', 'busybody', 'regulations', 'property', 'weapons', 'safety', 'like', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'resigned', 'sensual', 'interaction', 'Morticia', 'Gomez', 'differed', 'enormously', 'behavior', 'other', 'sitcom', 'couples', 'as', 'well', 'Actually', 'still', 'differ', 'contemporary', 'shows', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'randy', 'jokes', 'far', 'same', 'thing.The', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'mail', 'week', ""'ve"", 'been', 'enjoying', 'as', 'much', 'when', 'was', 'eleven', 'still', 'have', 'crush', 'long', 'haired', 'beauty', 'lovely', 'gray', 'pallor']","Addams Family, Vol. 3 VHS"

first 22 episodes in order as they appeared in late /64 and into early /65.Technically they have been excellently remastered and are a delight both audially and visually,crisp and clear.While the set isn't loaded with extras it does have some nice commentary on a few selected episodes by the then children,cousin It and the author of the ""Addams Family Chronicles"",two or three short featurettes,some photosand some original drawings by creator Charles Addams.Seeing these shows again for the first time since their original airing is not only a fond nostalgic trip but it certainly gave me a new found respect for the wonderful talent involved in this show from the technical crew to of course that wonderful,wonderful cast.Each and everyone played this right straight down the line(if you want this kind of comedy to ""play"" it's the only way to go) and were superb at it.Who can forget that wonderful Lurch sound of disgust,Gomez' sudden impulsive bravado and zeal and of course Morticia always there to reign Gomez in in her inimitable low key way???The Addams family made the uncool,cool and the different acceptable.They turned the ""Father knows Best"",""Make room for Daddy"" or ""Donna Reed Show"" images on their collective ears and came at life from a totally different perspective....redefining ""normal"" in the process.They were trying to tell us all in a sense to be a little more tolerant of societal outcasts....different wasn't necessarily to be shunned and ridiculed.Quite a message for 1964 but one I felt then and feel even more today.And however different the Addams Family was viewed by those that came in contact with them on the show the point was usually totally lost to most of them that the Addams's were actually in a very real sense more normal than they were.The Addams Family was just that....a very close knit and LOVING family.The fact of not only THEIR closeness but how important their  living relatives and family history were was a recurring theme throughout the shows' run.The Addams Family I cannot recommend enough and especially to Moms and Dads today looking for something the entire family can sit and watch together(geesh,whatever happened to those days??).There simply has never been another show like this one on the air before or since and I'm glad to see it still remains to many a TV classic because that's just what it is.I cannot wait for the rest of this series to appear.Watch and enjoy!!",5,"""Breeding will always tell""-The Addams Family finally arrive!",1164412800,"11 25,

The movies overall enhanced the sense of black humor to the proceedings, and there is still that sense of black humor in the TV series, but bear in mind that it was a TV series from the 60s, and while some things might be somewhat tame or even dated by today's standards, there are others that are quite daring for its time and overall still quite enjoyable today.for example, it was something of an unspoken rule that a husband and wife on television could not sleep in the same bed or even display any outward affection for each other.  On this show, even though I do not think they've ever shared a kiss, it was quite clear that Gomez and Morticia had a very healthy marriage, in hearing their pet names for each other, seeing them dance together or touch each other affectionately, or in seeing Gomez passionately kiss Morticia's arms up and down whenever she spoke French, it was damn obvious they had a VERY healthy marriage.  But it was also a very effective symbol to married couples, that the passion doesn't necessarily need to die down after two people have gotten married.Also, the lifestyle of the family in the fact that their interests and hobbies may be seen as abnormal by societial standards, it does give a clear indication that the Addamses weren't afraid to be themselves and more often than not considered the norms and practices of 'ordinary' society to be abnormal.After all, it's not everyday your child comes running home from school crying her eyes out because she heard a story at school of a dragon being slain by a knight in shining armor.And let's not beat around the bush, if you're feeling a bit stressed out by life's problems, what better way to relieve stress than to stand on your head for a few hours, or maybe blow up a few model train sets?Such is the beauty of this show, and why we enjoy watching the Addams clan in all their wonderfully weird and eccentrically entertaining exploits.

Like The Munsters (which originally debuted 1 week later), The Addams Family ran on television for two seasons, and became more popular in TV syndicated reruns than during its original broadcast. No doubt due to the show's memorable cast and classic theme song by composer Vic Mizzy, who also provided the vocals and fingersnaps.The Addams Family (who were fleshed out and also named expressly for television by original cartoonist Charles Addams himself) starred Carolyn Jones as macabre matriarch Morticia Addams; John Astin as her wildly enamored husband, lawyer Gomez Addams; Jackie Coogan as Morticia's Uncle Fester; Blossom Rock as Grandmama, Gomez's mom; Ken Weatherwax as son Pugsley; Lisa Loring as daughter Wednesday; Felix Silla as Cousin Itt; and six-foot-nine Ted Cassidy as Lurch the butler and as Thing, the helpful hand that popped out of the boxes throughout the family mansion. It should be noted that Cousin Itt was not a part of the original Charles Addams cartoons, but actually created for the show by producer David Levy.The Addams Family - Volume One is a 3-disc (572 min.) set which contains 22 [of 34] Season One episodes, meaning you'll be getting the entire 64-episode series in 3 cost-friendly volumes.

The wit, the dark humor, the goofiness and yes, even the whole Gomez/Morticia thing still burns white hot.Other reviewers have offered the breakdown of Vol I and what episodes it includes. So I won't restate that.The picture is in gorgeous black and white - as it should be. The transfer is clean and the audio is good for a 40 year old TV show.I will confess disappointment that John Astin wasn't included in the commentary. His thoughts would've been priceless. It saddens me he's not there. Not to dismiss those who took part. John was essentual to that show. To not have his input in commentary - feels incomplete.I have a few other tiny nitpicks - like why flippers (DVDs you have to flip to watch all the episodes)?

The commentary was easy to understand and very fun. Unlike my Jeannie and Bewitched DVDs, this set actually has subtitles available. On the other DVDs I have touse the closed captioning on the TV, which is much more cumbersome. Even the menus for each episode are well done.

The most shocking thing about how the Addams Family was dispite all the weird wonderful trappings of their home.  Despite all the odd ball relatives they had.  Dispite all the odd foods they ate it was suprising how normal they all were.Morticia Addams loved her husband passionately as he Gomez was in passionate love with his good lady wife.  Morticia and Gomez showed to the family and the world that time had not staled or made mundane the love burning in their hearts for each other.  As a child I think it would be awesome knowing my parents were so totally in love with each other.  The children were strange but again their love for their parents, and all their weird pets, extened family or servants never failed.  One of the most enduring memories of the series is that they all always polite enough to thank thing for lending a hand whenever needed.I guess thats what I love most about the Addams Family is that it suggests weird alone is not bad.  The Addams Family was fun fare to be sure, but it also taught me to enjoy life as I am no matter what others think.  As a disabled child growing up in the 1960's world of rigid conformity it was so nice to see in the members of the Addams Family examples of uniquely odd but good hearted people who so totally enjoyed being different from the norm.I was always sad the Addams Family series had not made it to DVD.  I used to come to Amazon.com and enter Addams Family only to see the more recent movies result from my searches.  I was at work on break when I found the Addams Family Series Finally made it to DVD!  I literally howled with a giddy gleeful joy that likely shocked my co-workers!  I brought the Addams Family DVD's immediately because, it was for me a total no brainer.  I will be waiting in the light of a full moon to buy the next installment of the Addams Family Series.I think everyone who loves to laugh should buy this Addams Family DVD it is good for you inside and out.",5,America's Other First Family,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,2079,"['Addam', 'Family', 'just', 'did', 'things', 'most', 'people', 'uptight', '1960', 'America', 'always', 'wanted', 'do', 'usually', 'did', 'not', 'dare', 'most', 'shocking', 'thing', 'how', 'Addams', 'Family', 'was', 'dispite', 'weird', 'wonderful', 'trappings', 'home', 'odd', 'ball', 'had', 'Dispite', 'odd', 'foods', 'ate', 'was', 'suprising', 'how', 'normal', 'were.Morticia', 'Addams', 'loved', 'husband', 'passionately', 'Gomez', 'was', 'passionate', 'love', 'good', 'lady', 'wife', 'Morticia', 'Gomez', 'showed', 'family', 'world', 'time', 'had', 'not', 'staled', 'made', 'love', 'burning', 'hearts', 'other', 'child', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'awesome', 'knowing', 'parents', 'were', 'so', 'totally', 'love', 'other', 'children', 'were', 'strange', 'again', 'love', 'parents', 'weird', 'pets', 'extened', 'family', 'servants', 'never', 'failed', 'One', 'most', 'enduring', 'memories', 'series', 'always', 'polite', 'enough', 'thank', 'thing', 'lending', 'hand', 'whenever', 'needed.I', 'guess', 'what', 'love', 'most', 'Addams', 'Family', 'weird', 'alone', 'not', 'bad', 'Addams', 'Family', 'was', 'fun', 'fare', 'be', 'sure', 'also', 'taught', 'enjoy', 'life', 'am', 'matter', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'disabled', 'child', 'growing', 'up', '1960', 'world', 'rigid', 'conformity', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'see', 'members', 'Addams', 'Family', 'examples', 'uniquely', 'odd', 'good', 'hearted', 'people', 'who', 'so', 'totally', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'different', 'norm.I', 'was', 'always', 'sad', 'Addams', 'Family', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'made', 'DVD', 'used', 'come', 'Amazon.com', 'enter', 'Addams', 'Family', 'only', 'see', 'more', 'recent', 'movies', 'result', 'searches', 'was', 'work', 'break', 'when', 'found', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Series', 'Finally', 'made', 'DVD', 'literally', 'howled', 'giddy', 'gleeful', 'joy', 'likely', 'shocked', 'co-workers', 'brought', 'Addams', 'Family', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'was', 'total', 'brainer', 'will', 'be', 'waiting', 'light', 'full', 'moon', 'buy', 'next', 'installment', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Series.I', 'think', 'everyone', 'who', 'laugh', 'should', 'buy', 'Addams', 'Family', 'DVD', 'good', 'inside']","Addams Family, Vol. 3 VHS"

I'm really happy to have this classic show on DVD, but disappointed in the release format. While you get 22 episodes of the show in amazing black and white, it's not the complete first season. MGM has chosen to release the series in 3 volumes instead of two season sets. The video transfer and sound are truly incredible for a show this old. The video transfers are stunning and the sound is clean and crisp. I'm really amazed by the overall quality of this release. I don't understand why MGM chose to spread the 22 episodes over 3 double sided disc's instead of 3 single sided disc's. Why is it that Paramount studios can release affordable season sets, but MGM & Fox studios release individual volumes?

302976,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,630223168X,trebe,"[4, 4]","The Addams Family ran for two seasons on ABC, from 1964 through 1966.  Perhaps to generate greater sales, MGM Studios (now in bankruptcy) decided to break the two seasons (64 totals episodes), into three ""volumes"".  Volume 1 contains the first 22 episodes of the first season.  If you are a fan of the series, it is less expensive to getThe Addams Family - The Complete Seriesrather than purchase the individual volumes.  There's no guarantee what the future may bring, but when the series set was a Deal of the Day it sold for as little as $26.99.The after the idealistic portrayals of families on TV in the 50's, the 60's brought all kinds of weird and wacky permutations.  The Addams Family, Bewitched, and The Munsters, were part of the early wave of this trend.  The cartoons of Charles Adams featured in The New Yorker, were used as the basis for The Addams Family television series.  Working with cartoonist Charles Addams, executive producer David Levy and the show's creative staff, gave names to the previously unnamed cartoon characters, put them together as a family, and came up with a concept for the program.  The idea was for the unconventional and macabre Addams clan to shock whenever possible, without going too far.The program features John Astin as wealthy Gomez Addams, a lawyer and dabbler in the stock market.  Carolyn Jones is his cultured wife Morticia, whose hobbies include raising carnivorous plants.  Former child star Jackie Coogan is Uncle Fester, a strange fellow who can power a light bulb by sticking it in his mouth.  Blossom Rock is Grandmama, a witch who isn't malicious.  Ted Cassidy is Lurch, the faithful butler, who entertains by playing the harpsichord.  The Addams' children are played by Ken Weatherwax as the adventurous Pugsley, and Lisa Loring as the gloomy Wednesday.The program takes a while to develop a formula that works.  While the Addams are kooky and eccentric, except for Lurch, they really aren't particularly frightening.  While Lurch looks the part, he's slow moving and easy going.  Fester has a malicious streak, and sometimes totes a gun, but rarely gets violent.  Thing, the disembodied hand in a box, a most unique character, is an adaptation of an Addams' creation.  Introduced in Episode 20, hairy Cousin Itt (Felix Silla) was not created by Addams, and appears in four episodes in season one.The program has some provocative elements, one is Gomez's amorous behavior towards Morticia, usually initiated whenever she speaks French.  It's funny, but also kind of weird and creepy at times.  The program also features torture devices, like the rack, vise, pillory, and bed of nails, supposedly as ""therapeutic"" devices to relieve aches and pains.  These are probably not things children would find amusing, so despite the goofiness, The Addams Family, with its mature sensibilities, probably plays better to an adult audience.  Producer Nat Perrin wrote for the Marx Brothers, and there's a lot of Groucho Marx in Gomez Addams' personality and mannerisms.The Addams are mostly homebodies, as nearly every scene featuring the principal characters, takes place either inside the Addams' residence, or on their property.  Most of their dealings with the outside world involve either visitors to the house, or conversations over the phone.  Often the more entertaining episodes feature a great guest star, or focus on a particular family member (usually Lurch or Fester), in an intriguing way.  Some of the better episodes include:Lurch Learns To Dance (Ep 13):  Heavy-footed Lurch takes dancing lessons so he can cut up the floor at the Butler's Ball.  Talented Ted Cassidy is hilarious, prancing in a black leotard with Wednesday, doing the twist with Morticia, and dancing the tango with Gomez.The Addams Meets A Beatnik (Ep 15): A motorcycle riding beatnik (Tom Lowell) crashes at the Addams pad, to avoid dealing with his demanding father (Barry Kelly).Mother Lurch Visits The Addams Family (Ep 17): Ellen Corby guests as Lurch's mother who believes that her son is the owner of the Addams mansion.  To keep the deception alive, Gomez and Morticia assume the role of servants.  It's great to see the couple out of their accustomed roles.The Addams Family Splurges (Ep 19):  The family needs some cash for a vacation trip to the moon, and turns to betting on horses to finance it.  Roland Winters guest stars.Volume One features three fun and informative commentary tracks with surviving cast members Ken Weatherwax, Lisa Loring, and Felix Silla, and author Stephen Cox.  The Addams Family is an unusual program, that appeals to various audiences.  The early episodes contained in Volume One are not the strongest, as the stories and writing seems to improve as the season progresses.",3,from The New Yorker to primetime...,1302134400,"04 7,
