275324,A2FQ3K6PR86U62,6301963733,Alyosha,"[0, 5]","This must have been Segal's attempt to make some quick cash after the success of ""Above the Law"" and ""Hard to Kill"" because this looks like something you'd see as the second half of a B-movie double feature.  Even for an action film there isn't very much time spent trying to develope a compelling storyline.  This is another one where Segal is after some drug dealers, why exactly doesn't seem to be of much importance (Hey, they're there so why not kill them!) and 5 minutes into the film Segal is already leaving a trail of destruction and mayhem.  There just doesn't seem to be much cohesion to it all; more or less just a series of chances for Segal to smash these straw-men opponents of his.The reckless cop role from ""Above the Law"" is taken to new heights (or lows) in this film with Segal destroying entire sections of downtown Chicago, exchanging rounds of ammo with low-level drug dealers amidst crowds of civilians, and my personal favorite, driving his SUV through a playground in broad daylight with guns blazing.  Now that's how you protect decent citizens from these scumbag criminals!This has also got to be the most brutal of Segal's films.  It's as if Segal thought that by killing the badguys in increasingly barbaric ways he could get the audience to despise them even more.  It doesn't work.  These characters are totally empty, impersonal, hollow.  But that doesn't mean Segal is going to take it easy on them.  On the contrary, the number of arms that were broken in this film is more than that of every prior film ever made combined.  The word overkill comes to mind, especially at the end where the leader of the cartel not only gets his eyes gouched completely back into his head, but also gets broken in half over Segal's leg, thrown off a 15-story building, only to be impaled at the end of the fall.

Seagal then returns to Chicago to see his family only to end up in a conflict with a dangerous Jamaican drug posse. ""You's a dead man walking"" That's good stuff.

Seagal cleans it up the situation as only he could:  blasting a handful of the bad guys away with pistol and shotgun, and beating the rest savagely.This movie, like his premier ""Above the Law"", has some of his technically most proficient Aikido, particularly after he crashes his car into a department store and then takes on about four adversaries in a randori, or challenge of one defender against multiple attackers.Of course, it would not be some shattering news to reveal here that in the end, Seagal prevails over the leader of this drug posse, nicknamed Screwface (the name comes from a Bob Marley song). They fight with swords, bottles, and ultimately hands.  But the climactic fight is equally brutal as it is final.It was not nominated in the ""Best Movie"" category.

275337,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,6301963733,Haunted Flower,"[3, 6]","Marked for DeathBlu-Ray (1990, 2010)""Marked for Death"" was directed by Dwight H. Little and written by Michael Grais andMark Victor. Steven Seagal plays Drug Enforcement Agent John Hatcher who returns to his home town to relax after the death of his partner on the job. They say you can never go home again and the case is the same here as Jamaican drug lords have taken over the place and Hatcher has to show them who is boss. Hard to believe it's been 20 years since this film was made but HD has been kind to 20-years-ago Seagal.This martial-arts action movie is full of zippy one-liners. For example, Seagal duct-tapes a man's mouth and then asks, ""Got anything else to say? I didn't think so."" He issues deep messages like, ""Get the **** out of town or DIE!"" and seriously within one minute issues another threat finishing with, ""or you DIE!""This is a movie you can doze off for a few minutes during and you didn't miss any important, uh, plot points. Very basic low-to-no effort action shoot-em-up, hand-to-hand combat, break-each-guy's-wrist, explosions film. All you need to know is that there are bad Jamaican drug lords and they are going after Steven Seagal's family and neighborhood and the only way to stop them is to kill them with the help of football coach, Max played by Keith David who will forever remind me of ""There's Something About Mary"". Also there is a voodoo element involved with the bad guys so Steven Seagal has to prove his magic is ""bigger"" (their word, not mine) to stop everyone.It would take some big magic indeed for Seagal to win an Oscar. It's no secret that Seagal's powers of acting are limited at best but if you want to see him break a wrist, this is the film to watch. Every line he utters is spoken at the same volume with the same inflection with a bit of a whisper backing it up and is exactly like his MADtv parody years back.

275339,A319SKSB556033,6301963733,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[2, 2]","Marked for Death is a bit of an anomaly in the early, golden-age of Seagal cinematic rampages. The man was virtually owned by Warner, but M4D was released by Twentieth Century Fox. As his third big screen movie, it's not really THAT much different from the rest of the vintage. Once more he's out for revenge/justice, and is hard to kill and above the law as he does so.Seagal plays John Hatcher, a ruthless DEA agent who lives the life of killing/maiming absolutely everything and everyone in sight. There's virtually no one he hasn't killed. Tired of making death a living he retires to the cozy, strictly white and middle-class Lincoln Heights suburb of Chicago. Upon arriving home he greets all his old pals, and his mother who appears to be Italian or Spanish (another lame attempt by Seagal to quietly imply that he's got some mysterious roots when in reality he's Steve Seigel, an Irish-Jew). It's not all happiness and handshakes though, as the terrifying Jamaican Voodoo Posse, run by Abu Qua High Priest madman Screwface, have infiltrated Chicago and are dealing death to schoolkids.Irie, Irie.Hatcher wants nothing to do with it, and would rather just mind his own business despite the protest of best friend Max (a mostly wasted, but brilliant as always, Keith David). But after a couple of close encounters Hatcher just can't help himself and returns to the business of killing absolutely everyone and everything in sight.Basil Wallace, as Screwface (and Screwface), is honestly one of the most enigmatic, mesmerizing, and downright weirdest movie villains of the 90s. He's really, really out there. I recommend watching this with the subtitles on as you'll have absolutely no idea what the Jamaicans are saying. Some of the things they say, while being mostly gibberish, are highly quotable. One of Screwface's many quirks is the fact despite his millions and magic powers he spends his spare time sitting around playing dominoes with his minions while wearing the world's best jumper.Director Dwight H. Little handles the action competently, if not brilliantly. The fight scenes and chases are relatively straight-forward, but in terms of story coherence the editing is all over the place. It appears that the original cut of the film was in a different order, and had much more plot. There are several established threads (the Voodoo, the Professor, the Columbians, the FBI) that are never developed. At 93 minutes, M4D is too rushed and has a rather abrupt ending.James Newton Howard provides a score that is sporadically brilliant, much like the movie itself. There are some lovely cues in there, but overall it's brought down a few notches by the generic nature of the rest of it. If only a few more elements of M4D were developed and taken a few stages further we would have had a true classic, as it is it's merely low-brow entertainment with a truly bizarre and outrageous villain.The Blu Ray is a MASSIVE improvement on the DVD (which was just a direct port of the flawed 1991 Laserdisc). In fact it may well be the best DVD-to-Blu Ray transition so far. You've not seen all of M4D until you see this Blu Ray. Sporting a 1080p 2.35:1 picture with more information on the left, right, AND TOP of the screen, the film is presented with it's true, naturalized cinematography and correct color timing. The DTS HD-MA sound is also a big improvement.

Is the movie any good?  Well, as an action movie, it delivers.  The soundtrack works surprisingly for this low budget yawn and the major actors provide solid performances.  Steven is believable as the hard hitting, bone breaking retired DEA agent John Hatcher.  Keith David is a solid side kick as old pal who cannot take the drug pushing Jamaican posse any longer.Basil Wallace is effective as the voodoo villain Scewface and brings the best performance to the table.  All in all, this movie is fun, for what it is, a piece to show off Steven Seagal's aikido talents.  The fight scene in the department store is entertaining and the last fights in the flick are some of Seagal's best ever. The movie is probably really only two stars, but the voodoo angle, strong performances, and martial arts fair make it a four star movie for those into this type of action genre.Silly moments do abide:  The car chase in downtown Chicago (it is not Chicago, because one notices palm trees in the background), is over the top and too long.

In what there is of a plot, Seagal, a martial arts cop from Chicago (think Chuck Norris in CODE OF SILENCE), makes a mess out of the local drug posse's operation, whereupon the posse decides to nail a cow's tongue to his front door and torture and kill Seagal's loved ones. Seagal takes vengeance.This movie is all about gratuitous violence, pain and torture, and includes some really classic Beer Film moments---Seagal's wife is tied, nearly naked, on a voodoo altar and is almost voodone before Seagal rescues her; Screwface's eyes are squished into his skull (the accompanying shriek says it all), his chopped-off head is put on display, and his corpse is snapped in half at the spine over Seagal's knee. If they had an Oscar that carried a swordcane, this movie would win it.Considering that all the moments just mentioned take about a minute of total screen time, we are left with about 100 more minutes of this kind of fun.

I've never been a big fan of Steven Seagal , but now own two of his movies (the other being Exit Wounds), and the person buying them for me is determined to convert me. It's not going to happen. Steven just bores me. He's just a very bland and emotionless actor, and I don't really find him that terrific to watch. Whether he deliberately plays the characters that way, or its him, I don't know. And his voice drives me up the wall, half the time you can barely hear him, and it does sound like a two packs a day voice.What I will point out about this movie, is that it's quite graphic, so definitely not for the faint hearted. The neck breaking sounds sent shivers up my spine, and as for the naked woman getting shot, didn't the director of Point Break just totally steal that? There's also decapitation, impaling, eye-gouging (at least it's not hair pulling), hand severing, and breaking of limbs. The fight scenes are a bit dodgy there's no variety in the way the bad guys try to attack Steven's character and he disposes of them with hardly using any energy at all.The bad guy, played by Basil Wallace, and going by the name of Screwface (in reference to a Bob Marley song for some reason) has the most mesmerising eyes I've ever seen. They're practically the same as Elijah Wood's. I much prefer brown eyes on a guy, and while this guy wasn't much to look at, I definitely liked the eyes.There was a lot of political correctness about this movie, what I particularly noticed was his sidekick was of a different race, and the bad guys were Jamican, and extremely hard to understand!This movie is OK. I still don't see why he's so popular, and I'll never be a fan, but if people like him that's fine by me.

Seagal's character has become worn down by the rigors of police life and he returns to the home of his sister to find peace. Of course, his sister's perfect life is shattered the minute he moves in, as a ruthless Jamaican drug posse shoots up the home and severely injuries Seagal's niece. This of course leads to Seagal reassuming the lifestyle he previously indicated he was leaving 20 minutes earlier in order to become a decent human.

275356,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,6301963733,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","""Marked For Death"" is a lot of fun. This is what drives the movie: fun. Many of Steven Seagal's other films are fun, but are driven by different agendas:Above the Lawwas politically conscious,On Deadly Groundfocused on environmental issues, and evenUnder Siegewas a morality play to some extent. The under-lauded ""Marked For Death"", however, has no pretenses - only the simple equation of ""Seagal + Jamaican gangsters * guns, cars, and swords = fun fun fun"". I mean, what else do you call a film with sword-wielding cultists, enough spent ammo to carpet a gymnasium, cool martial arts, and Seagal in tip-top shape? - besides a personal favorite, that is.The story: John Hatcher (Seagal) is a jaded DEA agent. After witnessing the death of his partner, he resigns from the force and vows to return to family life in a quiet neighborhood of Chicago. However, he arrives to find his hometown teeming with Jamaican drug dealers, headed by the psychotic voodoo cultist Screwface (Basil Wallace,Blood Diamond). Though he does his best to ignore the impending danger, Hatcher finds both himself and his family in the dealers' sights after interfering in an assassination attempt, prompting him to team up with an old military comrade (Keith David, ""The Thing"") and take the fight to the criminals.Being an earlier theatrical release of Steven's, we needn't worry about the production quality like we would with a DTV outing of his and can focus on the film's strengths. Most noteably, this is one of the most consistently action-packed movies Seagal would star in: it begins with an on-foot chase through the streets of Colombia and goes on to feature no less than five shootouts, four masterful hand-to-hand encounters, a car chase,a couple big explosions, and an awesome swordfight...and those are only the big scenes. The action is some of the best work that Seagal has done: the swordfight wouldn't be topped by our hero for a long time (seeInto the Sun), and the four-on-one fight in Screwface's lair is second to none in showing practical aikido at work.Speaking of which, it needs to be said that Screwface is the most original villain that Seagal has ever fought. I'd go as far to say that he's the best ever featured in a Seagal picture. Aside from being more explosive, animated, and bombastic than Henry Silva, William Forsythe, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey, or Michael Caine ever were, the highly-underutilized Basil Wallace is the first nemesis who truly seems to get under our hero's thick skin and makes it more personal than Steven's feuds tend to be. His ability to personally take the fight to Seagal is unparalleled, as is the ""twist"" about him that tops off the story. As witnessed during the climatic swordfight, he's also the most well-matched opponent Seagal has ever had in a film - capable of going toe-to-toe with the big man and negating the quick, overly-efficient structure Seagal's fight tend to have.Alas, this film is not perfect, but thankfully, points of incompetence are limited and don't permeate the entire pictue. Regarding Seagal, he performs with the same non-flair that we're used to (thank goodness for the rest of the cast, including Tom Wright ofDumbarton Bridge), but in addition, his character's initial reluctance to not get involved in the drug problem spreading through his hometown is both uncharacteristic and unfounded, seeing as he retains his tough-guy air even while saying ""no"". Then there's the silly scene in which Seagal's gladness to be home is expressed by having him clean a concealable pistol while sentimental music plays in the background. There are a few more instances like that, but thankfully not enough to damage the film.It's a shame that this movie isn't recalled as readily as some of our hero's other work, since it supplies the adrenaline just as well. It's a slice of quality early-90s action cinema at the very least, and should be on the wishlist of every Seagal fan and action-lover around. This is one you really shouldn't hesitate to introduce your buddies to Seagal with.",4,"""Everybody want go heaven.

This one while not as good as Out For Justice, Above The Law or Hard To Kill and with a very slow first half hour is still a solid entry in the best of Seagals movie career. The violence at times can be brutal, the aikido scenes are staged very well and the plot moves along at an acceptable pace once it gets started. A lot of people comment on Seagals acting ability. For me Seagal is believable in all his early roles and believability in a role is acting which is why his later movies are all so terrible and lack not only believability but credibility as well. In Marked For Death, Seagal's character demonstrates that he has no problem doing what has to be done. Someone attacks him with a knife, he snaps their wrist and puts the knife in their chest. Someone tries to strangle him, he puts his fingers in their eyes and they soon let go. No fancy Van Damme moves just simple self defense. It is a sad thing to see how Seagal as fallen so far with the not so good movies that he is making these days like Half Past Dead, The Foreigner, Out Of Reach and the terrible Out For A Kill and Ticker. To be a success again he should go back to basics and keep things simple much like Van Damme has with the excellent In Hell and Wake Of Death.

The Aikido fight scenes and the shootouts are extremely violent; much more then the previous Seagal entries. Not just the violence but the drug content is more noticeable here than it was in Above the Law and Hard to Kill.Seagal this time plays John Hatcher, a cop that has seen to much violence in his day, and is eager to retire after seeing his partner get brutally murdered in an assignment. Hatcher takes a leave and goes to live with his sister and niece. While there Hatcher begins to notice that there is drug dealing in the area by Jamaicans and Columbians. A feud later occurs between both dealers; Hatcher gets too close and kills many of the Jamaican drug dealers. Now the Leader of the Jamaican drug gang (Screw face) wants to eliminate Hatcher out of the way. He and his family are now Marked For Death, hence the name of the movie.The fight scenes in this movie are arguably the best I've seen; unfortunately the story isn't that original. But the fight sequences are quite graphic, specifically the last scene with Seagal fighting Screw face...Gosh its quite strong to watch that scene, even by today's standards its pretty violent. This is Seagal while he was still in shape and not as cocky as his future films. The acting is good from Seagal's part, so is the Aikido fights, the story as I said could have been a bit smarter, but hey we watch Seagal for the action not much for the plot.

The action has never been better than when the ponytail is whipping in the wind. In this film, Segal decides to mix it up with some pretty poorly portraied Jamaicans. They are the neighborhood druglords in Segal's town. But, really, these guys are great. They drop their accents when they feel like it, and they worship a demi-god set of twin brother darkness named Screwface. As for Segal, he really impressed us. He plays the hardass cop who takes it upon himself to bring down the drug ring. His one-liners were top-notch. (e.g.""This is my silent partner. A whisper in the ear from this girl goes a long way."" This line was about his favorite gun. We rest our case.)  And he was kicking in faces like he would later in his illustrious career polish off slices of pizza. We were actually shocked that he looked kind of fit in the movie. He even went jogging with his old war buddy for a half a block.Now, Marked For Death is an extremely solid B film.
