And so now I needed something to kick my ass back into shape.I was looking around and found this DVD.I started the work out 2 days ago and am still a bit sore but it's a GOOD soreness, know what I mean?I can't quite keep up 100% with the workout right now...but I do get through it (groaning and grunting, Oh My God! Those lunge exercises...holy crap!) and I feel so GREAT afterwards.Billy Blanks keeps you motivated. Never gets cheesy like some workout video people do. He keeps it real and the people he's working out with also really make you want to work just as hard.I LOVE the fact that it's recorded in real time...so you see them all sweat right along with you, and one of them even grunts too. Ha ha. Love it!I'd highly recommend this video if you want a GOOD REAL workout, want to sweat like mad and want to feel energized afterwards.This is GOOD STUFF!!!!!!!!(and you don't need the stick. I use a stick I found in my garage (have no idea what it came from. looks like it was a leg off some kind of camping gear?) Anyhow, what's also cool about the video is that there is a set of people using the stick and another set not using it. So, you don't have to use one if you don't want to.I switch between using one and not. Makes the workout more interesting that way.",5,EXCELLENT Workout!!

This is a very good cardio that really hits the upper body very hard. This is exactly what I need. Billy is the best, he really gives me the strength to go on.

1090528,A1RXOMZTOSAP1O,B000TJ6P7E,Mary Bryant,"[5, 5]","Must say that I hesitated to get another Taebo set, thinking this was just a gimmick.  Let me say that I changed my mind.  I bought the workouts without the amplifier.  I wish I had it, but improvised by using a homemade bar with weighted gloves.  It was almost the same.  The bar made the familiar moves unusually effective.  I felt like I was doing martial arts during portions of the workout.  That was gratifying to me.I had double knee replacement about 3 months ago and found having a bar very convenient to help support me while I regain my muscle stregth.  I did modify a few moves to keep from putting too much stress on my knees, but was very happy with the level of the workout.  I was dripping with sweat at times, so I had fun.Thanks Billy!",5,Lots of fun for a Taebo veteran,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,753,"['Must', 'say', 'hesitated', 'get', 'Taebo', 'set', 'thinking', 'was', 'just', 'gimmick', 'Let', 'say', 'changed', 'mind', 'bought', 'workouts', 'amplifier', 'wish', 'had', 'improvised', 'using', 'homemade', 'bar', 'weighted', 'gloves', 'was', 'almost', 'same', 'bar', 'made', 'familiar', 'moves', 'unusually', 'effective', 'felt', 'was', 'doing', 'martial', 'arts', 'portions', 'workout', 'was', 'gratifying', 'me.I', 'had', 'double', 'knee', 'replacement', '3', 'months', 'ago', 'found', 'having', 'bar', 'very', 'convenient', 'help', 'support', 'regain', 'muscle', 'stregth', 'did', 'modify', 'few', 'moves', 'keep', 'putting', 'too', 'much', 'stress', 'knees', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'level', 'workout', 'was', 'dripping', 'sweat', 'times', 'had', 'fun.Thanks', 'Billy']",N/A
