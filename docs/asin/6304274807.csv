410765,A2J18HGXQVBVOR,6304274807,"Angela Hailey ""sableskin""","[10, 10]","I stumbled across this movie plumbing Amazon as I do for AA movies.  This movie will DEFINITELY be going onto my christmas list!  I won't rehash the plot, but let me add a few things.  This movie is full of layers that might go unnoticed, especially to younger audiences, but they are powerful nontheless.  It is rare to see a movie about antebellum south that shows characters with so many dimensions.  For instance:1.  It is rare to see a movie address the much earlier abolition of the slave trade in England.  One of the Master's guests make a point of leaving the table, unwilling to participate in the fruits of slavery, presumably not feeling charitable to those uncivilized enough to do so.2.  As the plantation is on the brink of bankruptcy, we see the master is as odious to his own family as he is to his slaves.  He demands that his son work alongside the slaves, and is later surprised when his oldest son essentially removes him from handling his own affairs, in much the dismissive way he has always treated his family.3.  The black slave driver is shown to be on the fringes of society, as an unwelcome interloper, never in, never out, and always able to lose that status at the drop of a dime.4.  The prevalence of guns, pointed by both white and black men at the slaves demonstrates more than anything else the fact that many southerners lived in fear of their slaves.  Often, these movies show caricatures of the races, but this movie shows how ambivalent and precarious positions of power could be.5.  When he talks about his wife, John describes a woman who made a sacrifice of sale to protect her child.  It is a little known fact that many men in the south found themselves on the receiving end of violence at the hands of women that they ""owned"".  Since history is written by the victors, it is very rare to read about an all-powerful white male who got his behind kicked by a black woman with a shovel--but it happened--alot.5.  Although there is a definite 'feel-good' component to the movie, Sarny actually survives by her wits more than luck, and as we see her in the last scene, she is leaving determined to make her own luck.As an African American woman, I found this movie incredibly deep and relevant.  The final scene alone is worth the price of the movie.  Finally, slaves are shown in their roundness, capable not only of just trickery and sabatoge, but cunning, patience, and vision. I cannot express the correctness of the pro-literacy message, one I spout on a daily basis. I will recommend this to everyone I see--everyone deserves to see it!",5,ABSOLUTE KEEPER!

Sarny is a young girl, born into slavery and raised by a foster mother after her natural mother was sold. Nightjohn is an adult slave who had run away, gone north, been free, learned to read and write, and then returned so he could teach slaves to read. This was not just forbidden, but extremely dangerous.One of the things I appreciated about this movie was the way Waller's two young sons are depicted. The older son especially is very conflicted about the conditions under which they live. Not just the lousy conditions for the slaves, but the way he and his brother and his mother and even his father are victims of the evil system too. In fact, in terms of spiritual strength and self-respect, the slaves did better than their masters.This was a movie made for TV, and probably never would have been a commercial success if played in theaters.

Not only the inhumane physical torture to break the body and will that is usually portrayed in ""slavery in America"" movies, but this movie focused on the attempt to keep the slave mentally crippled/enslaved ""total helplessness"". It was  a crime subject to extremely harsh punishment or even death, if caught learning to read or write.

It costs him dearly, as it did in real tales of the ante-bellum south. A young slave girl, Sarny (Allison Jones), knows the value of education and learns her letters and numbers from John, a child, and her own hard struggles in self-teaching. It works but also eventually costs Sarny something, but she, like Nightjohn, has something no bad plantation owner can take away or sell. Letters!I can't speak for the book by Gary Paulsen, or accuracy of adaptation, but this is a FANTASTIC DVD that if family friendly and should be shown to students to encourage them in their pursuit of knowledge to their highest potential. Older people, like me, can simple enjoy the heart-warming story.There are a very few violent situations, treatment of slaves, that is primarily indicated and leading to, but not shown on screen. It has no bonuses, not even subtitles for the 'southern English' accents.This film was created in connection to Disney and Hallmark so that almost guarantees a worthy 5-star production.

410776,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6304274807,Linda Linguvic,"[1, 1]","This 1996 made-for-TV movie was originally broadcast on the Disney channel to great acclaim. Directed by famed African American director Charles Burnett, this is a gripping drama set on a southern plantation in the 1830s.  Nightjohn, brilliantly played by Carl Lumbly, is a newly arrived slave on the plantation.  Just looking him makes the viewer know that he has a long and sad tale to tell.  He is strong and good looking with coal black skin and huge eyes and deep scars on his back from many whippings.  He also has a secret which makes him unique among the slaves because he knows how to read. Secretly, he  teaches this skill to young 12-year old Sarney, played by Alison Jones. Naturally there are complications.The story has a large cast of characters with several interweaving stories.  The plantation owner, played by Beau Bridges, is in debt and in competition with his brother, his own son is questioning the father's decisions about treatment of the slaves and his wife is having an affair with the local doctor.  The individual slaves have their stories too.  There's the young man who is wooing a girl on another plantation.  There's the faithful slave played by Lorraine Troussant who brought Sarmey into the world and who has seen Sarmey's mother sold off.  There's the old slave man who had a finger cut off because he knew how to read.  But most of all, this is the story of slavery and the hardship it creates.The film moves fast.  There is never a dull moment. It depicts the horrible institution of slavery including the work in the cotton fields in the heat of the day as well as the problems faced by the slave owners.  But most of all it tells the story of one small girl who dared to be more than her station in life expected of her and of the dire consequences of her actions.

I also understand that the book must be quite different so if you have read the book please expect some difference as it is quite normally the case that when you read a book - the following movie does not meet expectations. I make this comment based on a reviewer that doesn't not like the movie, but basing feeling on the book - which may be fair, or unfair.So, to reiterate as a viewer with no expectations based on the movie  - brilliantly stunning and educational. My 8 year old watched this and also could feel lessons being unraveled. She liked the power of literacy and brought select sections to her class to share at school.I would not just show this to young kids without viewing it and considering the kids, the ecology of such a decision would simply be wrong - but if you feel fit - a child can get a lot out of this movie.

The acting and everything else about it puts you right in the middle of the story with them, as if it's happening NOW.  The movie evokes feelings of shame that white people could ever treat other human beings who are also children of God, in such disgraceful ways.  How ignorant we whites were!  This is a movie everyone should see, as it's an outstanding history lesson for all.  There are no English sub-titles, which disappointed me, but it is ""closed-captioned"", which I don't understand.  There is nothing to click on at the beginning to activate that feature.  Therefore, I missed some of the dialogue, which I could HEAR well enough, but I have difficulty UNDERSTANDING what is said if the speaker does not enunciate well.  I have ordered the book by the same name on which the movie is based, which should clear up that little problem for me.Beau Bridges is totally convincing as the evil plantation owner who mistreats his slaves, who are so realistic in their roles I found myself yearning to put my arms around them for comfort!!  ""Nightjohn"" is a slave who sacrifices his freedom in order to remain on the plantation to teach a little 12-year old girl slave and others to read and write, which is punishable by death if caught.  The movie is full of action and under-the-surface emotion on the part of the slaves.  The spirit of it is so realistic that at the end, I had to jerk myself back to 2008 reality.This film reminds us of the tremendous power of words.  That is why slave ""owners"" were so determined to refuse education to their slaves, to keep them in subjection, demanding obedience in every instance. As teacher Nightjohn explained to his fellow-slaves, ""Words are freedom.""I would not recommend this movie for those under 12 yrs. old.

The New Yorker's Terrence Rafferty proclaimed _Nightjohn_ the ""best American movie of 1996.""  I agree.The plot concerns Sarny, a twelve-year-old slave girl who learns to read, and uses her knowledge to expose and undermine the plantation power structure.  Performances are excellent -- newcomer Allison Jones is especially good as Sarny -- and Burnett's direction is honest and forthright.  Although _Nightjohn_ has a strong pro-education message, it is conveyed with plenty of suspenseful drama and a bare minimum of preachiness.  Family filmmaking doesn't get better than this.The _Nightjohn_ DVD, like the laserdisc edition before it, presents the film in its original full-frame ratio without supplements or bonuses.  The transfer and sound are adequate -- and given the price, that's about as much as anyone can reasonably expect.Note to parents: For a film that features no profanity, no sex or nudity, and only a few instances of onscreen violence, the PG-13 rating on this DVD seems excessive.  _Nightjohn_ is not for young children, because it strongly suggests the horror and brutality of American slavery.  But I'd recommend this film for ages 9 and up, with parental supervision.
