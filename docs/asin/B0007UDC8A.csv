890719,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0007UDC8A,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","This was a pretty decent action movie with a twist near the end that made the film even better.  Unfortunately there were also some moments near the middle of the film that dragged with unnecessary mushy romantic segments.  These segments shouldn't have been included in a film dealing with bad guys and gansters killing each other for much of the story.  The romantic bits felt completely pointless to me.This was a pretty good movie if you ask me.  Wasn't great, wasn't incredible or revolutionary in the world of action movies, but entertaining enough to give it a passing grade and a film I recommend watching.You'd probably expect plenty of guns and violence and bloody scenes.  Well, you somewhat get that, but the storyline didn't focus on the violent aspect as much as you think.Still, I liked it.  Movies like this have become underrated these days it seems since people tend to ignore them.",3,not bad,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,900,"['was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'action', 'movie', 'twist', 'end', 'made', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'also', 'moments', 'middle', 'film', 'dragged', 'unnecessary', 'mushy', 'romantic', 'segments', 'segments', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'included', 'film', 'dealing', 'bad', 'guys', 'gansters', 'killing', 'other', 'much', 'story', 'romantic', 'bits', 'felt', 'completely', 'pointless', 'me.This', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'ask', 'Was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', ""n't"", 'incredible', 'revolutionary', 'world', 'action', 'movies', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'give', 'passing', 'grade', 'film', 'recommend', 'watching.You', ""'d"", 'probably', 'expect', 'plenty', 'guns', 'violence', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'Well', 'somewhat', 'get', 'storyline', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'violent', 'aspect', 'as', 'much', 'think.Still', 'liked', 'Movies', 'have', 'become', 'underrated', 'days', 'people', 'tend', 'ignore']",N/A

890722,ALSDJP35S1DB4,B0007UDC8A,"Mr. King ""Lit/Comp 9A""","[3, 3]","by Tynesha MellsIn this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup?Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes. See, Reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter and J-Bone doesn't approve of his love friend. As J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie learns that love is about forgiveness. But what J-bone is doing, does it work? Do Reggie and his girlfriend break up, or does it bring them closer together?I like this movie because it leaves you wondering what's going to happen next and did this or that happen. I like movies with suspense! It kind of makes you want to be in the movie so that you could detect things. I also like this movie because everything falls in place, if you really pay attention to it!",5,Back In the Day,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,1083,"['Tynesha', 'MellsIn', 'drama', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'who', 'Reggie', 'loss', 'father', 'old', 'friend', 'J-Bone', 'who', 'cold-blooded', 'thug', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'Reggie', 'find', 'who', 'murdered', 'father', 'week', 'dad', 'died', 'preacher', 'Reverend', 'Packer', 'came', 'up', 'dead', 'Reggie', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'one', 'kill', 'did', 'Did', 'Reggie', 'kill', 'Reverend', 'Packer', 'was', 'type', 'setup', 'Back', 'Day', 'also', 'couple', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'See', 'Reggie', 'love', 'preacher', 'daughter', 'J-Bone', ""n't"", 'approve', 'love', 'friend', 'J-Bone', 'tries', 'destroy', 'what', 'have', 'Reggie', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'what', 'J-bone', 'doing', 'work', 'Do', 'Reggie', 'girlfriend', 'break', 'up', 'bring', 'closer', 'together', 'movie', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'did', 'happen', 'movies', 'suspense', 'kind', 'want', 'be', 'movie', 'could', 'detect', 'things', 'also', 'movie', 'everything', 'falls', 'place', 'really', 'pay', 'attention']",N/A
