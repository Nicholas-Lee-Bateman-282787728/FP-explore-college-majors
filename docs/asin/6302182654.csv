A fine cast with Edward James Olmos as a baseball scout in search of a player from the fields of Idaho to help the stuggling California (now L.A. Angels of Anaheim) Angels. One thing that made me wonder in the closing minutes of the movie. The Angels were down but the movie never mentioned if the Angels won their game over the Royals! It's a mystery!

300333,A3BD8STGDN1RT8,6302182654,"Selqet ""Silky""","[0, 0]","In spite of a talented cast, this movie is pretty poor, I couldn't even watch it the whole way, and I love baseball movies.  That might be part of it, if you know any thing about baseball, important parts of the plot are just too fantastic, too illogical, too incredulous to accept, even for a couple of hours while watching a movie.  The lines are so poor even Almos, one of the most talented actors of his time, is unable to sound convincing (he says ""son"" so often he'll actually get on your nerves).  Bracco and Almos don't pull off the couple in love, and the pitcher is poorly casted, he doesn't look like an ""Idaho farm boy,"" he looks as old as the other players, and his dumbfounded look, meant to accentuate his innocence, will also begin to grate quickly.  If you love Edward Almos, go get ""Stand and Deliver,"" a true story masterpiece, and posssibly the acme of his acting career, but you never know with him.  If you like Bracco, she's better in virtually every other movie (though it is funny that in this movie she has a master's in psychology, and she goes on to become Tony Soprano's shrink), I really liked her live when she did Mrs. Robinson, ""The Graduate"" on stage.  If you're looking for a sad baseball movie, try ""Bang the Drum Slowly,""  if you're looking for a ""Dying breed"" themed baseball movie, try ""Bull Durham,"" if you want a funny baseball movie I'd suggest ""Mr. Baseball,""  or ""Major League,"" or if you want a family baseball movie with a deeper message, ""In a League of their Own,"" or ""61.""",1,I'm not really sure how the other reviewers watched all the way,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,1521,"['spite', 'talented', 'cast', 'movie', 'pretty', 'poor', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'whole', 'way', 'love', 'baseball', 'movies', 'might', 'be', 'part', 'know', 'thing', 'baseball', 'important', 'parts', 'plot', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'fantastic', 'too', 'illogical', 'too', 'incredulous', 'accept', 'even', 'couple', 'hours', 'watching', 'movie', 'lines', 'are', 'so', 'poor', 'even', 'Almos', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'time', 'unable', 'sound', 'convincing', 'son', 'so', 'often', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'get', 'nerves', 'Bracco', 'Almos', 'do', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'couple', 'love', 'pitcher', 'poorly', 'casted', ""n't"", 'look', 'Idaho', 'farm', 'boy', 'as', 'old', 'other', 'players', 'dumbfounded', 'look', 'meant', 'accentuate', 'innocence', 'will', 'also', 'begin', 'grate', 'quickly', 'love', 'Edward', 'Almos', 'go', 'get', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'true', 'story', 'masterpiece', 'posssibly', 'acme', 'acting', 'career', 'never', 'know', 'like', 'Bracco', 'better', 'virtually', 'other', 'movie', 'funny', 'movie', 'master', 'psychology', 'become', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'shrink', 'really', 'liked', 'live', 'when', 'did', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'Graduate', 'stage', ""'re"", 'looking', 'sad', 'baseball', 'movie', 'try', 'Bang', 'Drum', 'Slowly', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Dying', 'breed', 'themed', 'baseball', 'movie', 'try', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'want', 'funny', 'baseball', 'movie', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'Mr', 'Baseball', 'Major', 'League', 'want', 'family', 'baseball', 'movie', 'deeper', 'message', 'League', 'Own', '61']",N/A
