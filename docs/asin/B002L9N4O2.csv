Its hard to believe that someone could laugh so much in 25 minutes. There isnt one series or sitcom on today that comes close to the talent and credibility of this show. Its no wonder that shows like this comes back in syndication showing reruns of the past. Todays actors and shows are money made, not quality made. This show was made when actors believed in what they were doing and proved it weekly. I spent about 55 on this set and except for the cheap packaging it came with (and I do mean cheap, dvds fall out of there cheap cardboard slots all the time) it is still an incredible good deal for a great great show.  6 seasons in all included in this set.

I prefer the single dvd cases with the muli-trays..that can hold up to six discs. The cardboard sleeves do line up to make a picture if that means anything, and yes the discs do shift a bit in the sleeves, but mine arrived unscratched, and now that they are settled, I doubt it will be much of a problem later, that being said, I really do love this show. It's a show that at first glance seems ridiculous. You have allied p.o.w.s carrying out covert missions from inside a natzi prison camp. However, the show works. The humor, the timing, the seriousness all works well together. Sometimes it's totally silly and implausible, but the cast is having so much fun it's hard not to go along with it. The interesting thing to me, was that Klink and Schultz were not your typical nazis, Scultz was simply biding his time until it was time to go back home. Klink wasn't really enthralled by all the propaganda, it seemed as if he could care less about impressing his superiors. a lot of people tend to say he was a bumbler, but in fact Klink was smarter than those above him in rank, he simply didn't wish to be there. He had better things to do with his time, he simply did not have a choice. The show, for all of its humor, managed to show real people responding to real situations. Klink's main concern was not being sent to the russian front. he could care less about third reich propaganda. Everyone here was not where they wanted to be. However, Hogan's Heroes was right where they needed to be. Where they could do the most good. I remember watching this show in my youth thinking how funny and well written it was. Upon seeing it available on dvd in a full season, I jumped at the chance to watch it, half worried that it would not live up to my memories. In fact it was better. Now that I'm older I understand the nuances of Schultz's character. I used to think he was annoying, but upon seeing the series I found him quite entertaining, and very interesting. The character dynamics on this show were simply amazing. There aren't too many shows written this well anymore. So anyone who is a fan of comedy and anyone who likes war time shows. I'd recommend this. In fact I'd say skip the Tom Cruise movie Valkyrie and watch the episode of Hogan's Heroes which showcased the same real life situation. The movie failed to do that event justice, but Hogan's Heroes managed to make it funny without overshadowing the overall weight of the situation. This is another definite must have collection for anyone who wants to add a very classic, very funny series to their tv/dvd collection.",5,Great series to own...,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,2697,"['am', 'not', 'fan', 'cardboard', 'do', 'love', 'series', 'love', 'fact', 'here', 'one', 'set', 'prefer', 'single', 'dvd', 'cases', 'muli-trays..that', 'can', 'hold', 'up', 'six', 'discs', 'cardboard', 'do', 'line', 'make', 'picture', 'anything', 'yes', 'discs', 'do', 'shift', 'bit', 'sleeves', 'mine', 'arrived', 'unscratched', 'now', 'are', 'settled', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'problem', 'later', 'being', 'said', 'really', 'do', 'love', 'show', 'show', 'first', 'glance', 'ridiculous', 'have', 'allied', 'p.o.w.s', 'carrying', 'out', 'covert', 'missions', 'natzi', 'prison', 'camp', 'However', 'show', 'humor', 'timing', 'seriousness', 'well', 'together', 'totally', 'silly', 'implausible', 'cast', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'hard', 'not', 'go', 'along', 'interesting', 'thing', 'was', 'Klink', 'Schultz', 'were', 'not', 'typical', 'nazis', 'Scultz', 'was', 'simply', 'biding', 'time', 'was', 'time', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'Klink', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'enthralled', 'propaganda', 'seemed', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'impressing', 'superiors', 'lot', 'people', 'tend', 'say', 'was', 'bumbler', 'fact', 'Klink', 'was', 'smarter', 'rank', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'wish', 'be', 'there', 'had', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'time', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'choice', 'show', 'humor', 'managed', 'show', 'real', 'people', 'responding', 'real', 'situations', 'Klink', 'main', 'concern', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'sent', 'russian', 'front', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'third', 'reich', 'propaganda', 'Everyone', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'where', 'wanted', 'be', 'However', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'was', 'right', 'where', 'needed', 'be', 'Where', 'could', 'do', 'most', 'good', 'remember', 'watching', 'show', 'youth', 'thinking', 'how', 'funny', 'well', 'written', 'was', 'seeing', 'available', 'dvd', 'full', 'season', 'jumped', 'chance', 'watch', 'half', 'worried', 'would', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'memories', 'fact', 'was', 'better', 'Now', ""'m"", 'older', 'understand', 'nuances', 'Schultz', 'character', 'used', 'think', 'was', 'annoying', 'seeing', 'series', 'found', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'dynamics', 'show', 'were', 'simply', 'amazing', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'shows', 'written', 'well', 'anymore', 'So', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'comedy', 'anyone', 'who', 'war', 'time', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'fact', ""'d"", 'say', 'skip', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'Valkyrie', 'watch', 'episode', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'showcased', 'same', 'real', 'life', 'situation', 'movie', 'failed', 'do', 'event', 'justice', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'managed', 'make', 'funny', 'overshadowing', 'overall', 'weight', 'situation', 'definite', 'must', 'have', 'collection', 'anyone', 'who', 'add', 'very', 'classic', 'very', 'funny', 'series', 'tv/dvd', 'collection']",N/A

Stanford ""gregory__scott""","[89, 95]","I received an advance copy of this set and it's spectacular and is reason for any Hogan's fan to be excited, unless of course you already shelled out money for the earlier releases.Packaged together for the first time, the 28-disc set includes all six seasons of the smash-hit series, as well as an arsenal full of extras including home movies, bloopers and audio commentaries.  The set will also contain an entire disc of new to DVD special features, including an extended version of the pilot with rare introduction, a new cast interview with Richard Dawson and a photo montage including unseen images set to a performance of the show's theme song by Bob Crane and his band.  Brand new ""Kommandant Rank"" graphics and packaging have been designed for this special set.Garnering two Emmy nominations for his role, Bob Crane stars as Colonel Hogan, who together with his fellow Prisoners of War at Stalag 13 cleverly outwit their German captors.  Firing off a non-stop string of one-liners from behind enemy lines, the ragtag team - includingRichard Dawson, Robert Clary and Larry Hovis - lead a relentless comic assault on their Nazi captors, conducting espionage and sabotage campaigns right under the noses of their warders.  While the enemy is often gullible, easily fooled or downright incompetent, the real strength of Hogan's men are the elaborate ruses and sometimes dangerous lengths they will go to complete their mission.  Werner Klemperer earned back-to-back Emmy awards for his role as the German Colonel Wilhelm Klink.  Airing from 1965 through 1971, HOGAN'S HEROES garnered three Emmy nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series.HOGAN'S HEROES THE KOMPLETE SERIES, KOMMANDANT'S KOLLECTION arrives armed with a disc of new to DVD material, including:A new interview with Richard Dawson, who played Corporal Peter NewkirkAn extended version of the pilot episode ""The Informer,"" with a very rare network introductionA segment from Hollywood Palace, featuring the cast of Hogan's HeroesAudio of the HOGAN'S HEROES theme song performed by Bob Crane and his band accompanied by a special photo montage of images from the show and numerous rare behind-the-scenes photographsClip from CBS' 1965 Fall Preview Show, ""Seven Wonderful Nights""Two series promosA new interview with Albert S.

1275926,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B002L9N4O2,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[5, 7]","HOGAN'S HEROES is one of those programs that neither jumped the shark nor became dated by the passage of time. Debuting only twenty years after the end of World War II, the show was an odd mixture of equal parts of sincerity, authenticity, and screwball comedy. Although HOGAN'S HEROES is now derided by many professional critics as one of the worst television shows ever produced, that assessment is grotesquely unfair.These critics point out that HOGAN'S HEROES mocks the experiences of wartime Prisoners of War and Concentration Camp inmates. How it does this is not entirely clear, since the Germans are the only objects of mockery on the show and the Holocaust never gets a direct mention.For six seasons (1965-1971), HOGAN'S HEROES entertained us by pitting the sharp Colonel Hogan (Bob Crane) against the buffoonish Colonel Klink (Werner Klemperer) in an unequal battle of wits. Hogan's men, though apparently POWs at the fictional Stalag Thirteen, were in reality a crack intelligence team that carried out missions to destabilize Nazi Germany. Colonel Klink was inordinately fond of boasting, ""There has never been an escape from Stalag 13!"" But why escape, when you can come and go at will through your own secret tunnel that reaches back to the Allied lines? As a matter of fact, Hogan's men even worked hard in one episode not to be transferred to another camp.The show had many elements of slapstick and some thoroughly unbelievable moments. Often, the show stretched the viewers' suspension of disbelief to the breaking point, particularly when `new prisoners' (i.e., people being spirited out of Germany by the Underground) came and went without explanation or question by Klink and his men or bald evidence of the team's elaborate espionage was uncovered. These moments resulted in doubletalk marathons that were legendary.It wasn't all fun and games though. The show did not shy away from addressing the prisoners' food shortages. Their dependence on the Geneva Convention was constantly addressed. There was a real sense of unease evident in the prisoners' relationships with the guards, including the very real risk of punishment if caught at their underground activities. Most of the `real' elements of the show were lifted from the fine war movies of the era, such as THE GREAT ESCAPE, BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI, and, in particular, STALAG 17, from which so many elements (most notably the Chief Guard Sergeant Schultz) were taken that the producers of that film sued the producers of HOGAN'S HEROES and won a still-memorable copyright infringement lawsuit.In spite of (or perhaps because of) the comedy, the show evidenced a real respect for the travails of men who had been real POWs during the War. One of the great ironies of HOGAN'S HEROES is that virtually every actor who played a recurring role as a German Officer, was in real life, Jewish. Not only were Werner Klemperer (Colonel Klink), John Banner (Sergeant Schultz), Leon Askin (General Burkhalter) and Howard Caine (Major Hochstetter) all Jews, but they all (along with Robert Clary, who played Cpl. LeBeau on the Allied side) were survivors of the Shoah. Werner Klemperer even had a clause in his contract stating that the show's writers were never to allow Klink to ultimately outwit Hogan. My father, who had been in Dachau, loved to watch HOGAN'S HEROES and laughed heartily at its inspired silliness; he, a Korean War veteran, also loved M*A*S*H, God rest his soul.Kommandant Klink was a self-important, insecure, pompously Prussian monocle-wearing clown. Hogan played upon his insecurities like a piano.  Schultz was an easygoing chief jailer whose sympathies clearly lay with the Allies (unless his superiors were around). His, ""I know nothing! . . . I hear nothing! . . . I see nothing!"" characterization inspired Artie Johnson's ""Verrrry interesting!"" German soldier on LAUGH-IN and later Christopher Lloyd's own thoroughly bewildered Sergeant Schultz in Mel Brooks' TO BE OR NOT TO BE.Robert Clary and Richard Dawson were to go on to stardom in their own right, Dawson as the original host of FAMILY FEUD, famous for kissing every female who ever appeared on that show. Bob Crane died in the late 1970s under unusual circumstances.HOGAN'S HEROES may not be as sophisticated as the comedies that followed it, but it is an affectionate homage to the real heroes who gave a measure of their lives, whatever it may have been, to the defense of freedom.",5,"""There has never been an escape from Stalag 13!""",1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,4444,"['HOGAN', 'HEROES', 'one',

1275949,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B002L9N4O2,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","""Hogan's Heroes"" was a staple of late 1960's comedy. Although frequently predictable due to the characters being so perfect in their formulaic roles (Klink is the bumbling, insecure camp commander, Hogan is the suave, smart hero who always outsmarts the bad guys, Schultz is the kindhearted and daft guard who could always be tempted with strudel, etc.), the show was brilliantly written and extraordinarily well acted for a sitcom.This set has all six seasons, and the quality is generally decent but is somewhat variable due to the nature of the original archive material. I actually found season six to be the worst of the set largely because of substandard audio. I couldn't begin to comment on the episodes (there have been entire books written on the subject) other to say that they vary between good and sublime. After watching the entire series over the course of a couple of weeks of winter treadmill training I decided that season four's ""Klink vs. The Gonculator"" is my favorite episode of the entire series. I am unsure why I like that episode so much, but it's pure television genius.The cast and writers deserve much of the credit for the lasting quality of this show and its lasting sociological impacts on American culture and vernacular (""I know nothing!"") The set does have a couple of extras, including commentaries and interviews with cast and series co-creator Albert J. Ruddy. Of the extras I found the recollections of Richard Dawson most interesting and poignant. Particularly touching is his story about how he came to learn that Robert Clary was an actual concentration camp survivor; once you hear him tell it, you'll never be able to look at either of them the same way again. This brings up a very important point: many people have been critical of the show over the decades for being in poor taste, but understand that the show is set in a Prisoner of War camp, not a concentration camp; there is a huge distinction, and Robert Clary would be the first to explain that. Sadly, Clary is the last surviving star of the series, but the others will live on in living rooms everywhere for years to come thanks to the good humored nature and fundamental brilliance of the cast and show.",5,What Is A Gonculator?

1275965,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002L9N4O2,trebe,"[231, 257]","For fans of Hogan's Heroes (1965-71), it is indeed fortunate that the program weathered the initial criticism and controversy, and went on to become a successful series for CBS for six seasons.  Created by Bernard Fein and Albert Ruddy, Hogan's Heroes featured Allied prisoners conducting clandestine operations from Stalag 13, a German prisoner of war (POW) camp.  In the initial season, various approaches were explored.  Much was learned, and changes were made that resulted in a better and funnier program.  When the writers had direction, and toned down some of the over the top wackiness, the stories became more credible, and Hogan's Heroes began to rise to new comedic heights.The program's wonderful ensemble cast, was headed by Bob Crane as Colonel Robert Hogan, Werner Klemperer as Luftwaffe Colonel Wilhelm Klink, and John Banner as Sergeant Hans Schultz.  It was often difficult for everyone to get screen time, but the core group of POW's, French corporal Louis LeBeau (Robert Clary), RAF corporal Peter Newkirk (Richard Dawson), and US sergeants Ben Kinchloe (Ivan Dixon), and Andrew Carter (Larry Hovis), soon developed into memorable characters.  Leon Askin as General Burkhalter, evolved into a semi-regular, followed later by Howard Caine as Gestapo Major Hochstetter.  With a large cast and guest stars frequently in the mix, Hogan's Heroes featured a rich variety of acting talent, guided by a creative team that included principal writers Richard M. Powell and Laurence Marks (MASH), and directors Gene Reynolds (MASH), Bruce Bilson, and Edward Feldman, who was also executive producer.The 1960's was an amazing decade, full of turbulence and change.  When Hogan's Heroes debuted in 1965, World War II was only twenty years in the past, and many still had deep feelings of hurt and loss.  It was understandable that some found the idea of a comedy set in a POW camp, to be offensive, or in questionable taste.  Others mistakenly confused POW camps, which housed military prisoners, with the extermination camps of the Holocaust.  Interestingly, actors Askin, Banner, Clary, and Klemperer, were Jews who had fled Europe to escape the Nazis.The primetime comedy lineup in 1965, was an eclectic mix from many genres that included Gilligan's Island, My Favorite Martian, McHale's Navy, Bewitched, The Munsters, The Addams Family, Mr. Ed, Andy Griffith, and The Beverly Hillbillies.  Also debuted in 1965 were That Girl, Get Smart, My Mother the Car, and I Dream of Jeannie.  With TV comedy exploring so many wacky frontiers, why not a sitcom set in a stalag?Allied prisoners digging tunnels were featured in The Great Escape (1963), a hugely popular film, based on real life events detailed in a book by Paul Brickhill.  The film took certain liberties with the truth for dramatic purposes, and Hogan's Heroes similarly mixed elements of fact with fiction, and then took matters to a radically ridiculous extreme, featuring an elaborate secret underground installation and tunnel system.  Early on, reality was stretched a bit too far, and things got a little too loose, such as when a plane was launched from the camp, artillery guns fired happy birthday flags, and a tank vanished inside the camp.  Even a parody can be taken to extremes, and adjustments were made to find an appropriate balance between reality and fantasy.  When the proper framework was established, and suitable writers found, Hogan and his men could achieve almost anything short of winning the war.  The relationship between the prisoners and the Germans, evolved from being a childish game of superiority, to one with a higher level of respect.Some aspects of life in Stalag 13 that had a basis in reality, included the scarcity of food, and the importance of the Geneva Convention and Red Cross packages.  POW's typically had only their one uniform to wear.  Prisoners had roll calls, faced punishment for subversive activities, and developed elaborate security and warning systems to cover their escape activities, which were typically coordinated by an escape committee.  German soldiers did fear of the Russian front, and there was an `underground' system that aided Allied soldiers.A big part of the series was the Hogan/Kink relationship, where Hogan continuously manipulated Klink by playing on his fears, ambition and vanity.  Klink was usually putty in Hogan's hands, but those rare occasions when things did not go Hogan's way, were usually a very interesting times.  Klink's incompetence so greatly aided the Allied cause, that it was hard to regard him as the enemy.  Werner Klemperer won two Emmys for his performance In the role.John Banner was simply magnificent as the portly Sgt. Schultz, a man with a resolve as firm as jell-o, who could be pressured or persuaded with food, into doing almost anything.  Banner was perhaps the most naturally funny of anyone, and often got many of the best lines, the classic 'I know nothing . . . nothing', being just one.  Banner could take over a scene by outrageously overacting, or just by reacting in the background.  It is impossible to conceive of the program, without this gentle man's singular talents.For many in the cast, Hogan's Heroes is what they are most remembered for.  Larry Hovis had a special talent as the goofball, demolition expert Carter, who did a hilarious impersonation of Hitler, and other Germans.  Robert Clary as LeBeau, was often found putting his culinary skills to use.  Handsome Ivan Dixon, was one of the first African Americans to be featured as a regular in a television series.  The episodes where Sergeant Kinchloe was spotlighted were always excellent.  Later known for hosting Family Feud, Richard Dawson was Peter Newkirk, a wisecracking hustler type, who fancied himself a ladies' man.  When Dixon left the series, Kenneth Washington replaced him in the final season, as Sergeant Baker.  Cynthia Lynn was Klink's secretary Helga for the first season.  Sigrid Valdis took over as Hilda, for the run of the series.  Valdis married Bob Crane in 1970.Leon Askin, much like John Banner, was a comedic jewel as General Burkhalter.  With an acidic voice, and a commanding presence, Askin delivered some devastating zingers, usually involving some massive putdown of Klink.  With Stalag 13 and the nearby town of Hammelburg, the hub for underground operations and sabotage activities, it was natural that the Gestapo (geheim stazpolizei) took an interest in the camp.  Howard Caine became a semi-regular as the sneering Gestapo Major Hochstetter.  Hochstetter was a serious and dangerous threat, and dealing with him was always a challenge.  The Gestapo often clashed with the Luftwaffe, adding a few more sparks to the fun.Bernard Fox as Colonel Crittenden, Kathleen Freeman as Gertrude Linkmeyer, Arlene Martel as Tiger, Nita Talbot as Marya, Dick Wilson as Fritz Gruber, and Jon Cedar as Corporal Langenscheidt (and others) were among the best of the reoccurring guest characters, with Noam Pitlik,  Victoria Carroll, and Dave Morick among the many who made multiple appearances in various roles.  The program featured a list of distinguished guest stars that included John Hoyt, Gavin MacLeod, Harold J. Stone, John Dehner, Whit Bissell, Harold Gould, Alan Oppenheimer, Frank Marth, Paul Lambert, John Stephenson, Ben Wright, and Theo Marcuse.  Some of the fine actresses who appeared include Antoinette Bower, Ruta Lee, Marj Dusay, Marilyn Mason, Barbara Babcock, Joyce Jameson, Lynn Peters, Jean Hale, Fay Spain, Claudine Longet, Sabrina Scharf, Mariana Hill, Leslie Parrish, Karen Steele, and Brenda Benet.Robert Clary has written a memoir entitled `From the Holocaust to Hogan's Heroes', and Cynthia Lynn has also written a memoir 'Escape to Freedom'.  Brenda Scott Royce's out of print book, `Behind the Scenes at Stalag 13' has some good information, although the episode summaries could have been much more comprehensive.The Kommandant's Kollection is the most complete set of complete series.  This new compilation appears to be a repackaging of the previously issued season sets, plus one new disc with additional bonus material.  The set maybe rates a B minus, for packaging.  To try and save space, the discs are separated into individual season sets, that are housed in folded cardboard sleeves.  The sleeves have a light brown sepia tone, and feature some cool photos.  The DVD's slide into cutout slots, and if they are not securely wedged in, the discs can fall out.  When you first open the set, check to see that none of the discs have become loose in transit.  The width of the outer box is only 2.5 inches, but it is slightly deeper than the most  DVD boxed sets.  It comes with a sliding plastic sleeve, which helps keep the season sleeves from sliding out.  With care, hopefully the long term durability of the set will be good, as paper sleeves don't offer very much protection against damage.Fans may be curious about the content on the New Special Features Disc.  The remembrances of Richard Dawson, and co-creator Albert J. Ruddy, are of particular interest, as sadly so many in the cast are no longer with us.  Much appreciation to the late Sigrid Valdis (Patricia Crane), who graciously shared her memories and thoughts, in the previously issued sets.  A brief summary of the major items on the new bonus disc follows:The Informer - Extended pilot episode :  The pilot has a lead in segment that features Fred MacMurray from My Three Sons, and an intro of the episode by Bob Denver and Alan Hale Jr. of Gilligan's Island.  The original pilot ran about 26 minutes, the extended version is 33 minutes.Clip from Hollywood Palace:  The cast of Hogan's Heroes make a brief appearance with host Bing Crosby.  Hogan's Heroes was produced by Crosby's production company.  (5 minutes)Richard Dawson Remembers:  Probably the best of the extras, features a very humble Richard Dawson reminiscing about his life, the show, and his fellow cast members.  Broken up into three segments, the total run time is about 44 minutes.Conversation with Albert S. Ruddy:  The series co-creator Ruddy, recounts how he and Bernard Fein, total novices to screenwriting, managed to get Hogan's Heroes on network television, and how CBS was sued for plagiarism by the producers of the movie Stalag 17. (12 minutes)The Safecracker Suite:  Al Ruddy explains how after being banned in Germany for many years, Hogan's Heroes was finally allowed to air there.  The dialog in the episodes was altered by the Germans, to be more ""appropriate"" for a German audience.  This is an example of an episode given this treatment.  A curiosity perhaps, but probably not of great interest to many.With a fabulous cast, and solid writing, Hogan's Heroes is a truly unique classic comedy, from that very special decade, the 1960's.  For some, it may engender memories of a time when sacrifice and working together for a common cause, was not such a strange concept as it may seem today.",5,an extended series retrospective . . .
