Both these movies sell for a lot more separate, but I got these two together for a good price.If you like anything to do with the south and south west you will like both these movies.True women deals with a time line from before the cival war up to about 40 years after the cival war. Be prepared that the writer does not make the Yankees come out in a very good light.It is a  pretty much accurate history of Texas and I liked that.It shows the need for slavery in that time and the evil of slavery both.It shows both how the native Americans were treated cruel and also how some Native Americans were cruel them selves, I liked that, most movies today hesitate to do that, being of both white and native blood myself  I like for the truth to be in movies.The other movie buffalo girls had a lot of humor in it, a little to much, but over all it was a good movie alI had been wanting True women for along time but it was about $ 18.00 by it's self until now, so I was glad to get these together. sometimes when you get two movies together like this at a discounted price the picture quality is bad, but both these had good picture quality.I would buy both these movies again, especially true women.",5,Tough western women,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,1260,"['two', 'movies', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'true', 'women', 'was', 'best', 'movies', 'sell', 'lot', 'more', 'separate', 'got', 'two', 'together', 'good', 'price.If', 'anything', 'do', 'south', 'south', 'west', 'will', 'like', 'movies.True', 'women', 'deals', 'time', 'line', 'cival', 'war', '40', 'years', 'cival', 'war', 'Be', 'prepared', 'writer', 'not', 'make', 'Yankees', 'come', 'out', 'very', 'good', 'light.It', 'pretty', 'much', 'accurate', 'history', 'Texas', 'liked', 'that.It', 'need', 'slavery', 'time', 'evil', 'slavery', 'both.It', 'how', 'native', 'Americans', 'were', 'treated', 'cruel', 'also', 'how', 'Native', 'Americans', 'were', 'cruel', 'selves', 'liked', 'most', 'movies', 'today', 'hesitate', 'do', 'being', 'white', 'native', 'blood', 'like', 'truth', 'be', 'movies.The', 'other', 'movie', 'buffalo', 'girls', 'had', 'lot', 'humor', 'little', 'much', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'alI', 'had', 'been', 'wanting', 'True', 'women', 'along', 'time', 'was', 'about', '18.00', 'now', 'was', 'glad', 'get', 'together', 'sometimes', 'when', 'get', 'two', 'movies', 'together', 'discounted', 'price', 'picture', 'quality', 'bad', 'had', 'good', 'picture', 'quality.I', 'would', 'buy', 'movies', 'again', 'especially', 'true', 'women']",N/A
