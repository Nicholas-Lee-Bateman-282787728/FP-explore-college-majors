1282649,A103ZG6ASSR7UT,B002P9K9T6,Clive S. Goodwin,"[5, 5]","This is the most exciting Rach 3 on dvd that I have seen/heard. Bonfman is truly amazing in this. However, the sound is not so great, as one might expect from a huge outdoor venue. In fact, I get no sound at all from my center channel with dts or dolby surround (not a problem with other discs).However there's no problem hearing a baby crying with gusto towards the end of the first movement. I would love to hear this combination in a real concert hall absent reluctant infant concertgoers. Even with the shortcomings, this is worth having just to watch and hear Bronfman.The Rite of Spring was disappointing, probably due to the acoustics. It was just flat-sounding, not much instrumental separation or oomph. For a hair-raising Rite, get Tilson-Thomas in his Keeping Score series - outstanding performance, sound and camera work. This was really well produced - perfect sync zeroing in on players at the exact time they're playing their part.About the above comments on extraneous noises - There is a Rattle/BPO with Barenboim playing Brahms' first  piano concerto,where you can hear birds singing along throughout. Pity they can't edit these things out.BUT - once again, get this for Bronfman!",4,"Great playing, intrusive noise",1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,1198,"['most', 'exciting', 'Rach', '3', 'dvd', 'have', 'seen/heard', 'Bonfman', 'truly', 'amazing', 'However', 'sound', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'huge', 'outdoor', 'venue', 'fact', 'get', 'sound', 'center', 'channel', 'dts', 'dolby', 'surround', 'not', 'problem', 'other', 'discs', 'problem', 'hearing', 'baby', 'crying', 'gusto', 'end', 'first', 'movement', 'would', 'love', 'hear', 'combination', 'real', 'concert', 'hall', 'absent', 'reluctant', 'infant', 'concertgoers', 'Even', 'shortcomings', 'worth', 'having', 'just', 'watch', 'hear', 'Bronfman.The', 'Rite', 'Spring', 'was', 'disappointing', 'probably', 'due', 'acoustics', 'was', 'just', 'flat-sounding', 'not', 'much', 'instrumental', 'separation', 'oomph', 'hair-raising', 'Rite', 'get', 'Tilson-Thomas', 'Keeping', 'Score', 'series', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'sound', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'produced', 'perfect', 'sync', 'zeroing', 'players', 'exact', 'time', ""'re"", 'playing', 'above', 'comments', 'extraneous', 'noises', 'Rattle/BPO', 'Barenboim', 'playing', 'Brahms', 'first', 'piano', 'concerto', 'where', 'can', 'hear', 'birds', 'singing', 'along', 'Pity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'edit', 'things', 'out.BUT', 'once', 'again', 'get', 'Bronfman']",Berliner Philharmoniker/Sir Simon Rattle: Tchaikovsky/Stravinsky/Rachmaninoff
1282650,A2OOXUXSS03V3X,B002P9K9T6,David M. Goldberg,"[1, 1]","This is not really a concert. It can be best described as a ""Musical Happening"" --------- one of these events categorized as ""Performance Art""  ------------ an Orwellian terminology for public vulgarity that is neither a performance, nor art. But I am getting ahead of myself. It is the BPO. It is Sir Simon who Rattles. It is Yefim Bronfman who owns the largest fists on the planet, bigger even than those of ex-World Heavyweight Boxing Champion, Primo Carnera. It is also The Rite of Spring, and Rachmaninov's 3rd Piano Concerto that could be aptly titled Hurricane for Piano and Orchestra, but in fact was played in suburban open-air Berlin as Concerto for Piano, Orchestra, and Hurricane where the Berliners clearly demonstrated that when rain comes to wind, they can muster many more umbrellas than Jacques Demy's citizens of Cherbourg.It was a crazy night, and it is captured superbly for all time with wonderful sound and stunning cinematography.  The stage stands in a sea of humanity that rises in front of it and travels backwards to a horizon that changes colour as light, darkness, and the elements all have their chance to wield their paint brushes on its broad canvass. It is a world apart, the world of action where everything happens, where each individual owns his personal destiny, where notes get played and might get fluffed, but miraculously never do. The world around it is the world of  passive victimhood, whose inhabitants can receive but can never give, except  applause, token of their appreciation. The concert began with a couple of Nuts from Tchaikovsky's Cracker, crunchy but pretty modest fare from an ensemble of this potential. The boxing match that followed was dramatic  ---- action-packed, full of tension, at times one-sided. In the first two rounds, Rattle clearly had Bronfman on the ropes where only the bell saved him from an ignominious KO. But in the last round he got his second wind, came out of his corner with both fists flailing, and almost put Rattle's silver scalp on the deck for good and all. But the latter ducked and weaved his way to the end of time-up when the spectators were provided with a complimentary cold shower by the management. It was a memorable contest, with honours  all round. I recall a statement in the movie SHINE that declares Rachmaninov's 3rd to be the most difficult work for the piano ever written, and it provided a contest of World Champonship quality.I don't know whether to call the second half of this HAPPENING ""The Rite of Spring"" or ""The Brollys of Berlin"". There was plenty of both, the first in sound, the second in sight. Let me just say that for all the distractions and diversions, Rattle and his brigade were able to keep their cool and concentration, going on to deliver a memorable performance encapsulating every nuance of this difficult work in all its colour and clarity. It was as extrovert and as unashamedly exhibitionistic as you can get in the realm of music, magnified many-fold because of the setting and the impression of infinite space that it provided. The orchestra played like possessed. I have never seen Sir Simon rattle his baton to such supremely musical effect. All were wreathed in smiles in the protective cocoon of the auditorium as they gazed out at the plebians who no longer had any dry grass to sit on. They were enjoying themselves enormously, not just because of their own good fortune, but because they were clearly infatuated with what they were playing. A stellar performance, brilliantly captures for posterity, with imaginative filming and unsurpassed sound quality. At the end, the sodden audience screamed for more and they got more: two encores in the 2nd of which they joined in and turned the event into a Berliner ""Last Night at the Proms"" or a Wiener ""New Years' Eve Concert"" under the stars. Utterly memorable. I repeat, not a Concert.

1282651,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B002P9K9T6,I. Giles,"[0, 0]","This is a memorable release on several counts. The obvious one is that, unusually, the audience was treated to a heavy rainstorm during the second half of the concert but despite this the audience displays total good humour and absorption in the music regardless of the awful conditions. This reflects the quality of music making in what must be described as less than ideal circumstances.The evening starts with four well-known items from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker - The overture, Christmas tree, March and Pas de deux. This music suits the Berliners perfectly showing their famed control and tonal resources to good effect.Rachmaninov's 3rd piano Concerto follows with Yefim Bronfmann as the soloist who delivers a towering performance of comprehensive emotional range and subtlety. Bronfman demonstrates phenomenal technique that rides over all the hurdles at speeds and accuracy that is simply spellbinding and is combined with wonderful delicacy of touch as required on frequent occasions. The Berlin players respond with sonority and musicianship under the superbly attentive conductor, Simon Rattle, who maintains close eye contact with Bronfman for considerable stretches of time. The audience erupts with an utterly deserved and prolonged standing ovation having maintained rapt silence throughout. Even the orchestra exhibits their shared delight in what has been an especially memorable performance.The Rite of Spring fills the majority of the second half. Rattle's long experience of the music and its complexity shows throughout with many details brought out to good effect. The orchestra responds with all the virtuosity at their considerable command. The audience's concentration persists despite heavy rain at intermittent points. Once again they are rewarded with an outstanding performance despite the demanding circumstances. (see below for comment about recording / playback levels).There is an encore - the intrada pas de deux from the Nutcracker which is the perfect foil for the Stravinsky with washes of rich string tone, swooping woodwind and burnished brass topped with glittering percussion. Perfect. An ebullient Berliner Luft ends the evening as Simon Rattle leaves the podium to take up the cymbal, reminding us of his early days as percussionist in the National Youth Orchestra.The HD imaging is superb and the sound, delivered in PCM 5.1 and stereo, is remarkably good considering the open-air nature of the venue and the awful weather conditions experienced through much of the second part of the concert. I would suggest that the playback level would benefit an increase of about 2 dB as the recording level appears to be slightly lower than usual. This benefits the Rite of Spring especially as it allows more internal detail to tell as well as adding more general weight. I have been unable to detect any hint of the synchronisation problems mentioned by another reviewer, neither on this Blu-ray nor on my previous DVD version.This amounts to a fine concert in less than ideal circumstances with the Rachmaninov concerto being especially notable as a performance of tremendous stature.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one.
