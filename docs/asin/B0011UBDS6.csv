In the midst of all of the shows aimed at teens which aim to show teens acting beyond their years, this one is much more young and fresh.  Sex is not at the helm of this show, and only a couple times has it been a centric theme.  It shows a group of young adults enjoying their lives, freedom, friendship and college.

1132650,A20MXB65JKHMNC,B0011UBDS6,Amazon Customer,"[20, 20]","A little Animal House, some Van Wilder, a dash of American Pie, and a pinch of Gilmore Girls-esque drama, Greek is the kind of premise that could have easily gone cheesy and overdone. Fortunately, it doesn't; whether it's depictions of life in the Greek system are accurate or exaggerated, it manages to find a happy medium between alcohol-drenched party scenes and actual character-driven drama.It's the characters, while mildly stereotypical, that really make the show; anyone who was awkward as a college freshman, whether they were in the Greek system or not, will identify with Rusty, the dorky physics major who longs to be in a fraternity; his older sister Casey may at first glance play the perfect blonde sorority princess, but she has plenty of flaws and problems to work through. Her current high-society boyfriend Evan, while definitely arrogant and a little flaky, also seems to have a sensitive side; but it's Casey's ex, ringleader of the Animal House-esque Kappa Taus, aptly-nicknamed Cappie, who steals the show. A funny, fast-talking, goofball with a heart of gold (which gets broken entirely too often), he's the kind of character you can't help but love (unless your Evan Chambers, anyway). The supporting characters, too, are surprisingly well-developed (Dale, Rusty's Bible-thumping, physics nerd roommate is hysterical, and Casey's archenemy Rebecca is the girl everyone loves to hate), and the show even tackles such issues as gays in the Greek system. However, the main theme of the show seems to be the importance of brotherhood, family and friendship. All in all, a great show, definitely worth a look.",5,A pleasant surprise,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,1629,"['little', 'Animal', 'House', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'dash', 'American', 'Pie', 'pinch', 'Gilmore', 'Girls-esque', 'drama', 'Greek', 'kind', 'premise', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'gone', 'cheesy', 'overdone', 'Fortunately', ""n't"", 'depictions', 'life', 'Greek', 'system', 'are', 'accurate', 'exaggerated', 'find', 'happy', 'medium', 'alcohol-drenched', 'party', 'scenes', 'actual', 'character-driven', 'drama.It', 'characters', 'mildly', 'stereotypical', 'really', 'make', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'awkward', 'college', 'freshman', 'were', 'Greek', 'system', 'not', 'will', 'identify', 'Rusty', 'dorky', 'physics', 'major', 'who', 'be', 'fraternity', 'older', 'sister', 'Casey', 'may', 'first', 'glance', 'play', 'perfect', 'blonde', 'sorority', 'princess', 'plenty', 'flaws', 'problems', 'work', 'through', 'current', 'high-society', 'boyfriend', 'Evan', 'definitely', 'arrogant', 'little', 'flaky', 'also', 'have', 'sensitive', 'side', 'Casey', 'ex', 'ringleader', 'Animal', 'House-esque', 'Kappa', 'Taus', 'aptly-nicknamed', 'Cappie', 'who', 'show', 'funny', 'fast-talking', 'goofball', 'heart', 'gold', 'broken', 'entirely', 'too', 'often', 'kind', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'Evan', 'Chambers', 'anyway', 'supporting', 'characters', 'too', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'well-developed', 'Dale', 'Rusty', 'Bible-thumping', 'physics', 'nerd', 'roommate', 'hysterical', 'Casey', 'archenemy', 'Rebecca', 'girl', 'everyone', 'hate', 'show', 'even', 'tackles', 'such', 'issues', 'gays', 'Greek', 'system', 'However', 'main', 'theme', 'show', 'be', 'importance', 'brotherhood', 'family', 'friendship', 'great', 'show', 'definitely', 'look']",Greek: Chapter One

The series is an interesting peak into college life in general and Greek life especially -- both the good and the bad, but mostly the good.  The reason why I couldn't give this DVD set more than three stars is because of the profanity (mild as it is), the promiscuity, and the binge drinking.  Oh, and then there's the sorority president prostituting one of her sisters to keep one of the popular guys in the most popular fraternity attached to their sorority.  Then that same sister dresses her sorority up like tramps to keep another fraternity from winning a floor hockey game.  This is not something that belongs on a so-called family network.

1132657,A2D0I7M2G43WWP,B0011UBDS6,Mena P.,"[1, 1]","Television about college aged kids nowadays, frankly, sucks. It sucks bad, mostly because it's reality television. When Greek was on, it was a breath of fresh air. Yes, there were parties, and drinking, and sex, but there was also real human emotion, and problems that everybody from every walk of life could relate to. Every time it was on, no matter what responsibilities I had, you better believe I was tossing my homework across the room and cranking the volume up.Our main cast of characters is:Rusty Cartwright (Jacob Zachar) - A flat out nerdy, inexperienced slip of a kid who is always living in his sister's shadow. Rusty is determined to make a name for himself at Cyprus Rhodes University by going from geek to Greek and pledging Kappa Tau, a rowdy fraternity filled with goof offs and partiers.Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) - Rusty's ""perfect"" sister. Casey is an active and proud member of Zeta Beta Zeta. She takes the Greek lifestyle very seriously, but also feels pressured because of Rusty's academics to be more than just a pretty sorority sister.Cappie (Scott Michael Foster) - President of Kappa Tau Gamma, as well as Casey's ex-boyfriend. Cappie actually takes his role as leader of the KTs very seriously, handling the job while living his life with a devil may care attitude. He takes Rusty under his wing an introduces him to college life.Evan Chambers (Jake McDorman) - President of Omega Chi Delta, and Casey's current boyfriend. He is a well-to-do rich kid, the well groomed heir to the Chambers empire who may not be as content with his life as he seems. Together he and Casey are the campus ""It Couple"", but must recover from a huge blow to their relationship.Calvin Owens (Paul James) - An Omega Chi prodigy who knows his way around a sports stadium. Calvin and Rusty bond and immediately become good friends. He is struggling with his identity of being a masculine gay man in a frat house full of on-edge straight guys, and is still (mostly) in the closet.Ashleigh Howard (Amber Stevens) - Casey's sorority gal pal and another active member of ZBZ. Ashleigh enjoys the partying lifestyle of the Greek system and happily spends her time planning social events and attending them. She makes some less than perfect choices about how to live her life, however, and learns things the tough way. She and Calvin bond.Rebecca Logan (Dilshad Vadsaria) - A young ZBZ pledge and slightly bratty politician's daughter. Rebecca has some less than pure intentions behind a lot of her actions, but underneath it all is just a girl who wants love from her constantly absent and less than capable father. Rebecca and Evan become a little too close for Casey's comfort, and she eventually begins to bond with Cappie.Dale Kettlewell (Clark Duke) - An uptight conservative Southern Baptist who proudly displays a Confederate flag above his bed and goes to sleep to the sound of gospel music. Dale and Rusty become good friends, despite Dale's staunch anti-Greek activism, although he spends a good amount of time warning Rusty of the dangers of pledging himself to a life full of such sin. He loosens up a bit as Rusty and Calvin widen his world-view.There are plenty of loveable background characters, such as the conniving Frannie (president of ZBZ) and goofy KT member Beaver (go ahead and ask him how he got his name, go on.) A lot of issues that college students actually tackle are addressed here, such as the stress of the Greek system, sexual pressures and expectations, and how to balance a school life and a personal life. There's plenty of funny times amongst the seriousness, so one never has to worry about whether or not they're going to laugh.Now, be warned. For those who are just getting into this series, this is only the first ""chapter"". While it is a normal television season (ten episodes) the ""full"" season is composed of chapters one and two.

Gregg,"[0, 0]","There are basically (2) reasons I like this show; college newbie RUSTY CARTWRIGHT is a very dorky looking innocent and enthusiastic nerd/geek and his many endearing qualities grew on me quickly, and the ""Animal House"" like fraternity KTT - because they're such an odd mix of weird characters but they come up with some fun activities.Outside of that you get to enjoy (or in my case ""NOT"") the never ending back-stabbing, conniving, bitchiness of the characters of the ZBZ sorority sisters.  And while of course there are people like this in real life, I'm sick to death of it on TV.  People growing up thinking this is how they should be, how they need to be to make it.  And, if it was ""real life"" those ""sisters"" would've gotten physical - and would've been kicked out of the house.  I can't see anyone living in that caustic of an environment for long.  Other characters are VERY sterotypical...Amazingly, this takes place in Ohio - but the weather in the show seems to be more like California or Florida. They wear shorts and sleeveless tops etc. pretty much the whole school year long - occasionally a hat or a sweat-jacket (hoodie) is worn.  And except for a VERY FEW episodes, nobody seems to have class or study. Where all the money comes from for most of the things these college kids do is also a wonder. Are they ALL from rich parents?  They seem to have endless financial resources - none of them having to work and they throw elaborate parties and activities with all kinds of expensive catering and decorating and costumes etc.Overall, I didn't think it was all that realistic or interesting of a show but watching young Rusty (aka ""spitter"") grow/mature, and the antics of the KTT house was entertaining.",3,Mixed feelings on this,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,1719,"['are', 'basically', '2', 'reasons', 'like', 'show', 'college', 'RUSTY', 'CARTWRIGHT', 'very', 'dorky', 'looking', 'innocent', 'enthusiastic', 'nerd/geek', 'many', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'grew', 'quickly', 'Animal', 'House', 'fraternity', 'KTT', ""'re"", 'odd', 'mix', 'weird', 'characters', 'come', 'up', 'fun', 'activities.Outside', 'get', 'enjoy', 'case', 'NOT', 'never', 'ending', 'back-stabbing', 'conniving', 'bitchiness', 'characters', 'ZBZ', 'sorority', 'sisters', 'course', 'are', 'people', 'real', 'life', ""'m"", 'sick', 'death', 'TV', 'People', 'growing', 'up', 'thinking', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'how', 'need', 'be', 'make', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'sisters', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'physical', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'kicked', 'house', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'living', 'caustic', 'environment', 'long', 'Other', 'characters', 'are', 'VERY', 'sterotypical', 'Amazingly', 'place', 'Ohio', 'weather', 'show', 'be', 'more', 'California', 'Florida', 'wear', 'shorts', 'sleeveless', 'tops', 'etc', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'school', 'year', 'long', 'occasionally', 'hat', 'sweat-jacket', 'hoodie', 'worn', 'VERY', 'FEW', 'episodes', 'nobody', 'have', 'class', 'study', 'Where', 'money', 'most', 'things', 'college', 'kids', 'do', 'also', 'wonder', 'Are', 'rich', 'parents', 'seem', 'have', 'endless', 'financial', 'resources', 'none', 'having', 'work', 'throw', 'elaborate', 'parties', 'activities', 'kinds', 'expensive', 'catering', 'decorating', 'costumes', 'etc.Overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'realistic', 'interesting', 'show', 'watching', 'young', 'Rusty', 'spitter', 'grow/mature', 'antics', 'KTT', 'house', 'was', 'entertaining']",Greek: Chapter One

1132665,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B0011UBDS6,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[2, 2]","Like many reviewers I was shocked upon my first visit to Cyprus Rhodes University.  Having been almost attacked with promos all spring in 2007 the series just seemed over the top, stereotypical and bland so I passed when the series initially aired.  But then a friend insisted that I watched the series.  And to my pleasant surprise I discovered a wonderfully entertaining and funny story of a group of kids just trying to survive the college experience.In the pilot many of the characters are presented as 2-Dimensional stereotypes.  You have the preppy boys, the hot/only-mildly-smart girl, the religious Texan, the nerd with the insane GPA and on and on.  But not thirty minutes into the series the writers start to peal back the layers of the characters showing the audience their true aspirations, fears, and heartache.  Within several episodes the characters have evolved from archetypes to people you very well could have gone to college with.  The people who you ate with in the dinning hall, the people you crammed with before finals, your friends.But I don't want to give the wrong impression of the show.  First and foremost this is a quirky soap-comedy.  Straying away from territory put forth by the perma-depressing ""Felicity"" or the too literal realm of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Dawson's Creek,"" the college presented in ""Greek"" is a understandably a fantasy college.  Money is never an issue, while the characters are seen in class they seem to have as much free time in the world (especially since not one of them have a part-time job).  But it is in the characters that you feel hooked into the series.Put into a satirical almost fantasy-like world of the ultimate view of college (complete with 300 sq ft dorm rooms), these characters are the heart of the show.  I know that for myself while I was entertained immensely from the amusing weekly shenanigans (which range from a depression-era speak-easy party, to a quest to make it rain beer, and having to run from an escaped mental patient) but it was the dynamic between the characters, the relationships, that brought me back episode after episode.""Greek"" is not a perfect show. It is cheaply made and obviously first-and-foremost aimed at those not yet in college.  But for those who enjoy great character structure there is enough poignancy in this return trip to college to definitely make up for the price of admission.  Highly Recommended.The Special Features on the DVD include: a selection of deleted scenes, a sneak peak at ""Chapter 2"" (which is already available on DVD with `Chapter 3' as well), the featurette ""Greek: The Initiation"" (which is a behind-the-scenes look at the conception of the show, casting, and the initial several days of filming, and three commentaries (Creator Shawn Piller and cast talk over the ""Pilot,"" while members of the cast discuss ""Friday Night Frights"" and ""Separation Anxiety.""",5,Welcome to the New Animal House,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,2899,"['many', 'reviewers', 'was', 'shocked', 'first', 'visit', 'Cyprus', 'Rhodes', 'University', 'Having', 'been', 'almost', 'attacked', 'promos', 'spring', '2007', 'series', 'just', 'seemed', 'top', 'stereotypical', 'bland', 'so', 'passed', 'when', 'series', 'initially', 'aired', 'then', 'friend', 'insisted', 'watched', 'series', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'discovered', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'story', 'group', 'kids', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'college', 'experience.In', 'pilot', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'presented', '2-Dimensional', 'stereotypes', 'have', 'preppy', 'boys', 'hot/only-mildly-smart', 'girl', 'religious', 'Texan', 'nerd', 'insane', 'GPA', 'not', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'series', 'writers', 'start', 'peal', 'back', 'layers', 'characters', 'showing', 'audience', 'true', 'aspirations', 'fears', 'heartache', 'several', 'episodes', 'characters', 'have', 'evolved', 'archetypes', 'people', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'college', 'people', 'who', 'ate', 'dinning', 'hall', 'people', 'crammed', 'finals', 'friends.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'wrong', 'impression', 'show', 'First', 'foremost', 'quirky', 'soap-comedy', 'Straying', 'away', 'territory', 'put', 'forth', 'perma-depressing', 'Felicity', 'too', 'literal', 'realm', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'college', 'presented', 'Greek', 'understandably', 'fantasy', 'college', 'Money', 'never', 'issue', 'characters', 'are', 'seen', 'class', 'seem', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'free', 'time', 'world', 'especially', 'not', 'one', 'have', 'part-time', 'job', 'characters', 'feel', 'hooked', 'series.Put', 'satirical', 'almost', 'fantasy-like', 'world', 'ultimate', 'view', 'college', 'complete', '300', 'sq', 'ft', 'dorm', 'rooms', 'characters', 'are', 'heart', 'show', 'know', 'was', 'entertained', 'immensely', 'amusing', 'weekly', 'shenanigans', 'range', 'depression-era', 'speak-easy', 'party', 'quest', 'make', 'rain', 'beer', 'having', 'run', 'escaped', 'mental', 'patient', 'was', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'relationships', 'brought', 'back', 'episode', 'episode', 'Greek', 'not', 'perfect', 'show', 'cheaply', 'made', 'obviously', 'first-and-foremost', 'aimed', 'not', 'yet', 'college', 'who', 'enjoy', 'great', 'character', 'structure', 'enough', 'poignancy', 'return', 'trip', 'college', 'definitely', 'make', 'up', 'price', 'admission', 'Highly', 'Recommended.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'DVD', 'include', 'selection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'sneak', 'peak', 'Chapter', '2', 'already', 'available', 'DVD', 'Chapter', '3', 'as', 'well', 'featurette', 'Greek', 'Initiation', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'conception', 'show', 'casting', 'initial', 'several', 'days', 'filming', 'three', 'commentaries', 'Creator', 'Shawn', 'Piller', 'cast', 'talk', 'Pilot', 'members', 'cast', 'discuss', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Frights', 'Separation', 'Anxiety']",Greek: Chapter One
