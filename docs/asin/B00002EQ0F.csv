It was an entertaining movie but the simplistic research passing off as 70's style did make it seem a bit weak.

And he's also a gay stripper and  porno star?  The vigilante characters are just as unbelievable; as well as  the token &quot;mob&quot; element.If you watch this with the thought  in your head that this is some alternate universe and not trying to portray  70's NYC then you will be fine.,3,"Entertaining, not Spike's best",960595200,"06 10, 2000",2000,629,"['far', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'best', 'was', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'simplistic', 'research', 'passing', 'off', '70', 'style', 'did', 'make', 'seem', 'bit', 'weak', 'Italian', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bronx', 'CBGB', 'punk', 'rocker', 'affecting', 'British', 'accent', 'who', 'old', 'Who', 'room', 'air', 'guitar', 'Babo', ""O'Riley"", 'new', 'Fender', 'Strat', 'also', 'gay', 'stripper', 'porno', 'star', 'vigilante', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'as', 'well', 'token', 'quot', 'quot', 'watch', 'thought', 'head', 'alternate', 'universe', 'not', 'trying', 'portray', '70', 'NYC', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'fine']",N/A

514726,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00002EQ0F,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 5]","I can see where Spike Lee may have been trying to mimic the gritty masterpiece that was David Fincher's `Se7en' but he fails in many areas to capture anything reminiscent of the preceding film.  `Summer of Sam' focuses too little on the menacing killer and too much on a group of people we could care less about.  What made `Se7en' so brilliant was that while you never saw the killer except in minor scenes you always felt his presence.  Here you never feel anything related to the killer.  I feel bad for Lee (and Imperioli) because I hear that the original script dealt more with the killer himself but that because of concerns of the victim's family members the script was cut down and rearranged to focus more on this group of Italian-Americans instead of the infamous David Berkowitz.  This was a grave mistake in my eyes, grave.The film centers around Vinny and his girlfriend Dionna, their pal Richie and his love interest Ruby among others.  Vinny loves disco and loves cheating on Dionna and Richie seems to love both men and women and strips for money.  During the summer of 1977 the friends are all sent into a whirlwind of paranoia as they anticipate the psychotic next move of the crazed killer known as The Son of Sam.  There are moments, rare as they are, when we can feel the tension and the paranoia but for the most part the film is so masked over with the social activities of this group of young Italians that we are taken as far away from the killer as can be and thus removed from the very fear we are supposed to feel.Lee should take a lesson from Fincher for in both `Se7en' and more recently `Zodiac' Fincher was able to take us inside the mind of a killer as well as the paranoid citizens left in the wake of his storm masterfully.  Lee failed miserably to do this.One good thing I can say about this though is that John Leguizamo proved he could act.  I never really thought of Leguizamo as a serious actor.  He's funny and all that but when he's tackled serious roles (`Empire' anyone) he didn't captivate me the way he should have.  Here he blew me away.  His performance was outstanding, captivating, commanding and very well rounded.  He was funny when he needed to be, dramatic when called for and believable all the way around.  As Vinny he became the pillar of the film and quite literally one of the only redeeming points here.`Summer of Sam' could have and should have been amazing.  It wasn't.  It has it's moments but in the end it comes off misplaced, choppy, uneven and a tad boring.  Even if you never see the killer you should be able to feel him all around you, engulfing you in a wave of panic induced uncomfortable feelings.  In `Summer of Sam' the only uncomfortable moments come from realizing that this movie is missing every mark it set out to hit.",2,This is one dull summer...,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,2798,"['can', 'see', 'where', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'mimic', 'gritty', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Se7en', 'many', 'areas', 'capture', 'anything', 'reminiscent', 'preceding', 'film', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'focuses', 'too', 'little', 'menacing', 'killer', 'too', 'much', 'group', 'people', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'about', 'What', 'made', 'Se7en', 'so', 'brilliant', 'was', 'never', 'saw', 'killer', 'minor', 'scenes', 'always', 'felt', 'presence', 'Here', 'never', 'feel', 'anything', 'related', 'killer', 'feel', 'bad', 'Lee', 'Imperioli', 'hear', 'original', 'script', 'dealt', 'more', 'killer', 'concerns', 'victim', 'family', 'members', 'script', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'rearranged', 'focus', 'more', 'group', 'Italian-Americans', 'instead', 'infamous', 'David', 'Berkowitz', 'was', 'grave', 'mistake', 'eyes', 'grave.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Vinny', 'girlfriend', 'Dionna', 'pal', 'Richie', 'love', 'interest', 'Ruby', 'others', 'Vinny', 'disco', 'cheating', 'Dionna', 'Richie', 'love', 'men', 'women', 'strips', 'money', 'summer', '1977', 'friends', 'are', 'sent', 'whirlwind', 'paranoia', 'anticipate', 'psychotic', 'next', 'move', 'crazed', 'killer', 'known', 'Son', 'Sam', 'are', 'moments', 'rare', 'are', 'when', 'can', 'feel', 'tension', 'paranoia', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'so', 'masked', 'social', 'activities', 'group', 'young', 'Italians', 'are', 'taken', 'far', 'away', 'killer', 'can', 'be', 'thus', 'removed', 'very', 'fear', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel.Lee', 'should', 'take', 'lesson', 'Fincher', 'Se7en', 'more', 'recently', 'Zodiac', 'Fincher', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'mind', 'killer', 'as', 'well', 'paranoid', 'left', 'wake', 'storm', 'masterfully', 'Lee', 'failed', 'miserably', 'do', 'this.One', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'though', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'proved', 'could', 'act', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'Leguizamo', 'serious', 'actor', 'funny', 'when', 'tackled', 'serious', 'roles', 'Empire', 'anyone', 'did', ""n't"", 'captivate', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'Here', 'blew', 'away', 'performance', 'was', 'outstanding', 'captivating', 'commanding', 'very', 'well', 'rounded', 'was', 'funny', 'when', 'needed', 'be', 'dramatic', 'when', 'called', 'believable', 'way', 'around', 'Vinny', 'became', 'pillar', 'film', 'quite', 'literally', 'one', 'only', 'redeeming', 'points', 'here.', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'was', ""n't"", 'moments', 'end', 'off', 'misplaced', 'choppy', 'uneven', 'tad', 'boring', 'Even', 'never', 'see', 'killer', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'engulfing', 'wave', 'panic', 'induced', 'uncomfortable', 'feelings', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'only', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'come', 'realizing', 'movie', 'missing', 'mark', 'set', 'out', 'hit']",N/A

514733,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,B00002EQ0F,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 0]","Spike Lee's critically aclaimed 1999 Summer of Sam is a period piece more about the paranoia of a small community than it is a film about the Son oF Sam murders. Lee sets his film during the hot and gritty summer of 1977 and as a period film it is quite good. The viewer feels the heat and the danger of that summer as a killer stalks his victims in a tight knit Italian neighborhood.John Leguizamo plays Vinnie a philandering husband who may or may not have been seen by the killer following one of his murders. Mira Sorvino plays his long suffering wife Dionna. Also of note in the well chosen cast is Adrian Brody as Richie, a neighborhood regular who is trying to be a punk rocker and his girlfriend Ruby (Jennifer Esposito).The film does its best when it takes on the issue of fear of outsiders in an insular community or even more distubing the fear of anyone who does not follow the trends of a typical crowd.There have been comments that Lee has denigrated the Italian community with this film but I don't think that is the case at all. Lee's movie could reflect any racial group. Lee has created a snapshot of a particular place and time and its effect on the people living there.

Their prime suspect is Adrien Brody (in a  performace sadly overlooked by Oscar voters) who one morning dons a spiked  hair-do, dog collar and begins speaking with an English accent.  Temperature's raise and tempers flare, ultimately leading to violence and  betrayal.

This is definitely not one of Spike's better films but in SOS, Spike strays from his usual racial discourse to a portrayal of the universal dualities of human nature and the &quot;shadows&quot; of the human psyche.  This theme is highly intriguing and well worth exploring, however Spike's plot gets lost in a barrage of vulgarity, graphic sex, violence and splatter.  SOS is a musical and visual montage of the period and realistically captures the fear, hysteria and paranoia of the time.

The film centers on a small neighborhood on the hottest day ofthe year and the breakdown that occurs when tempers flare. The onlydifference between SUMMER and ... is this: it's 1977 and theSon Of Sam murderer is on the loose, prowling the streets and shootingpeople as they sit in parked cars. To call SUMMER OF SAM rambling is agross understatement.  This film is everywhere, containing more then100 speaking roles and at least four complete storylines all atonce. We get to know the inhabitants of this little world (and in theminds of the citizens of this small Italian neighborhood it's justthat - no one can even get it through their head that the killer mightnot be from their neighborhood!) and we follow them through ups anddowns - OK mostly downs. The questionable moral center of the film isVinny (John Leguizamo at his greasy best), a guilt-ridden ... whocompulsively cheats on his beautiful and naive wife Dionna. The waytheir marriage falls apart during the film is pure Cassavetes, anunflinching, unapologetic portrait of emotional devastation. Vinny'sfriend, Richie (played by Adrian Brody in a career-makingperformance), comes back into town sporting a mohawk and a dogcollar. Richie has discovered punk rock and is immediately disowned bythe locals he used to hang with and, more importantly, tops their listof suspects for the Son of Sam killer. Richie's relationship withRuby, the neighborhood ...  (Jennifer Esposito, understated and fullof repressed pain), also raises a few eyebrows. But as twisted astheir relationship seems, they are the most endearing couple in thewhole movie. Lee simply follows these characters (and scores more) asthe events of film unwind, allowing them to breathe and react, redeemthemselves and fall apart. By the end of the film you are exhaustedand overcome. The violence is brutal, showing once and for all(listening all you ... enthusiasts) the sheer impact and destructionone man with a gun can make. The killer is also seen, in ramblingscenes as disturbing and uncomfortable as anything in .... The camera work is fluid and the soundtrack isperfect. Everything just seems to work here and given howunpredictable and wandering the screenplay is, it's amazing Lee pulledit off as well as he did. But make no doubt about it, SUMMER OF SAM isa brash and brutal film, one that pulls no punches and makes noapologies.

514746,ARORG3Z1ZVPX8,B00002EQ0F,Eric Wahl,"[71, 79]","Given the press reviews that came out upon this movie's release and a number of the reviews here, I'm going to buck the trend and suggest to you that Summer of Sam is actually one of Spike Lee's very best films.  Perhaps it was marketed ineffectively, but Lee clearly never intended this movie to be about The Killer.  Rather, Summer of Sam is about paranoia, conflicting ideas of community, and trusting one's self against and through an intense period of: the heat, economic downturn, sexual adventurousness, and drugs that were the late 1970's.  The Son of Sam's killing spree in NYC in 1977 triggered a fear and panic in the city that often made people who knew each other for years suddenly suspicious of one another.  At the time of its release this movie was roundly criticized for Lee's portrayal of Italian men as ""stereotypical 'Guidos,'"" but I would ask those folks who make such claims to consider this: if we say that a stereotype is a fixed, unvarying conception of a person, then why aren't all the Italian men in this film exactly the same in their actions and manners?  Were there no Italian men in NYC'77 who were quite like the three ""Guidos"" in Summer of Sam? And do you honsetly believe that Spike Lee intends for these three men to represent ALL Italian men?  Of course not.  And do we see examples of Italian men in Summer of Sam who are not ""Guidos""?  Several.  The characters are rendered masterfully, I think, and John Leguizamo gives an amazingly rich and layered performance as a man who cheats on his wife BECAUSE his curious religious convictions convince him his sexual desires are too perverse to ask of her.  When he comes perilously close to two of Sam's victims, Leguizamo's character undergoes an intense but ultimately doomed period of guilt and self-doubt that he tries to address but cannot--his desire to be good to his wife is very real, yet this desire is overpowered by his sexual desires.  In this vein the movie becomes an investigation of how people, ""good"" and ""bad,"" address their own desires--for sex, for status, for security.  And the paranoia created by he Son of Sam's killings creates strange bedfellows indeed: the ""Guidos"" protect an effeminate gay local because he is a good customer in their drug trade, but they harrass a guy they grew up around because he starts spiking his hair and listening to punk music; the local mafia boss bankrolls a neighborhood block party so people can have a good time in relative safety . . . because he's also provided the ""Guidos"" with baseball bats to protect everyone.  This movie is far more complex than most reviewers seem to indicate.  An excellent score and soundtrack that never overwhelms the action, and a gifted cast that delivers memorable performances, many of which should have been award-worthy (Leguizamo, certainly, but also the poignant and determined Mira Sorvino character, Adrien Brody's nearly-doomed punk rock dreamer, and the alarmingly unheralded Jennifer Esposito as the local tramp who really wants to change who falls in love with the punk rocker).  The film's climax, in which the wrong man is attacked and beaten by the ""Guidos"" (having been lured out of his house by his own conflicted friend) plays simultaneously with the capture and arrest of the real killer, and it is so masterfully rendered I don't think I'll ever forget it.  Bookended by commentary from notorious/ubiquitous/beloved NYC columnist Jimmy Breslin, Summer of Sam, as Lee surely did intend, is far more than a movie about seeming stereotypes and disco music during a scary time in the city.  It deserves a closer look by anyone interested in Lee's singular grasp of human dynamics and desires.

Mira Sorvino also has a number of roles on her resume that distinguish her as gifted in the diversity department.

The script jumps around quite a bit, trying to illustrate the lives of several characters during this period of ""terror"" in New York, when a crazed, maniacal killer was running through the city murdering dark haired women. There is too much of the debauchery of the day emphasised-the drugging, the clubbing, the sex party orgies, and Leguizamo's character's complete inability to be faithful to his wife, played by Sorvino. Leguizamo is having an affair with his boss (Bebe Neuwirth) and just about all his clients (he is a hairdresser). And basically any other woman he meets. And yet he cannot seem to perform with his wife. The fact that we know all these things about him really does not lend credibility to the film . We know far more about his sexual proclivities than we know about anything else in this film. In fact it is never quite clear what we are supposed to be getting from this film. It tries, but it never gets where it wants to go.",2,WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS?,1001548800,"09 27, 2001",2001,1235,"['John', 'Leguizamo', 'talented', 'diverse', 'actor', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'also', 'number', 'roles', 'resume', 'gifted', 'diversity', 'department', 'roles', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'flattering', 'skills', 'script', 'particularly', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'quite', 'bit', 'trying', 'illustrate', 'lives', 'several', 'characters', 'period', 'terror', 'New', 'York', 'when', 'crazed', 'maniacal', 'killer', 'was', 'running', 'city', 'murdering', 'dark', 'haired', 'women', 'too', 'much', 'debauchery', 'day', 'emphasised-the', 'drugging', 'clubbing', 'sex', 'party', 'orgies', 'Leguizamo', 'character', 'complete', 'inability', 'be', 'faithful', 'wife', 'played', 'Sorvino', 'Leguizamo', 'having', 'affair', 'boss', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'just', 'clients', 'hairdresser', 'basically', 'other', 'woman', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'perform', 'wife', 'fact', 'know', 'things', 'really', 'not', 'lend', 'credibility', 'film', 'know', 'far', 'more', 'sexual', 'proclivities', 'know', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'fact', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'getting', 'film', 'never', 'where', 'go']",N/A
514748,A2T0XBQM7N923Y,B00002EQ0F,Fady Ghaly,"[3, 4]","This is by far Spike Lee's grimmest film yet, which departs from his predominantly African-American themes and depicts the Italian side of New York City. Now, while it was also his greatest, in my opinion that is to say, I think its abrasive and rigorous tone is something that may draw plenty of viewers back, for this isn't at all the sort of film you'd presume you'd walk out of the theaters from with a smile on your face; this is not at all a film for kids, for it is even quite graphical toward its sexuality. (One scene, in particular, shows Vinny and Dionna inside some sort of nightclub that is scattered with nude people as they, like animals, are having sex with others whom they don't even know.)Summer of Sam is an intensely gritty and angry epic that takes you back to New York's infamous summer of 1977. Lee's aspiring film does more than re-create the events that unfolded throughout that certain period of time; in addition to being an entertaining time capsule with an effervescent seventies soundtrack that knows just how to set the mood (and ever so influential, for I could not even begin to speculate of just how many other films used such tunes), it also deals graphically with the concept of the mob mentality.The key characters, these number of despondent and allegedly ""shady"" people Lee created were not at all something he shied away from using as being stereotypes. Instead, he uses them to shatter conventional perceptions of racial and ethnic characteristics to show the beauty and deterioration of human nature.The character that stood as being most appealing to me would have to be Ritchie (Adrien Brody), a local kid who has enigmatically progressed a look of a punk-rocker and a British accent, which later, as Son of Sam's plague of terror had a great impact among the citizens of New York, perplexed everyone, for they assumed he was that mass murderer merely by his cultural background and rap that apparently offended many. Lee's greatest films thrum with a wound-up vitality, and Summer of Sam resonates with lewdness, remorse, and fear. It does not regard the murderer, as many would assume that it does, but rather his victims, not those he slayed, but those whose overstimulated resourcefulness bloomed into a lynch mob mentality. There is a portion near the conclusion of the film that displays a side of human nature that is as loathsome as it is common: the fever to find someone to blame and the need to blame someone who is different-Ritchie being one who is different, which represents him as a misfit to the rest of the crowd who dance to the beats of disco music and wear flashy cloth.The film also takes large detours into Vinny's sexual life, played by John Leguizamo, who vividly captures the apprehension his character undergoes as he strives to be lawful to the alleged ""woman of his dreams"". But it seems that the more he strives to be faithful to her, the more women he ends up sleeping with, and yet each time his appetite indulges these long-legged, big-breasted women who almost seem to supplicate for his ""sexual skills"", the more malevolence he has upon himself for being the man that he is, which proves true as he actually begins to assume that God himself is working against him, until ultimately such a deceitful lifestyle has great affect and it's all downhill from there, as it sadly was for everyone else.Leguizamo's performance was in my opinion the finest since Al Pacino's in The Godfather III, but unfortunately it remains as my opinion, for I think all the heart and soul he put into this project was completely disregarded. True-his presence in the film claimed him to fame, but that was merely his presence, for his performance wasn't allegedly worthy of an award, which I think is a belief of pure ignorance. Fair is a word the academy obviously doesn't go by, for it seems that they seek of those who are the most flamboyant. ""I see the new Latin artist as a pioneer, opening up doors for others to follow,"" says Leguizamo. ""And when they don't open, we crowbar our way in. We are taking our culture and suturing it to America. Like gum on the bottom of a shoe, we are not going to disappear. Unlike other people who totally assimilated, we are more interested in co-assimilation...America may not realize it yet, but Latin prototypes are being created right now, and not just by me. They are these mambo kings and salsa queens, Aztec lords and Inca princesses, every Hernandez and Fernandez, whom this country will one day come to understand and respect.""

514749,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00002EQ0F,"""flickjunkie""","[6, 9]","Having grown up in Queens, NY and being an Italian male who was single and dating in 1977, I was really looking forward to seeing this film because I could have been one of the guys being depicted. You might say I was in Son  of Sam's &quot;target demographic&quot;.To say I was grossly  disappointed would be an understatement. First, this film was deftly  misrepresented as a story about the 44 Caliber Killer, when in fact it was  really a slice of New York life in 1977. The killings served as a more of a  psychological backdrop to the story than the story itself. In fact,  Berkowitz gets little more treatment here than the New York  Yankees.After I resigned myself to the fact that this was really a story  about the lives of half a dozen New Yorkers in the seventies, I tried to  enjoy it as a period piece. The trouble is, it was not a good period piece.  This was more of a caricature of New York in the seventies than a realistic  portrayal. Spike Lee, who is usually known for his stark realism has  produced a lampoon of the era, (probably without intending to).As a  period piece it was hit and miss. The wardrobe and hairstyles were all  wrong for that period. Bell bottoms were still a mainstream style back  then. Despite the burgeoning of the disco generation, hard rockers were the  majority and were not in evidence in the film. Punk was very fringe yet it  was treated as if it were mainstream. Hair was styled and much longer. You  seldom saw anyone's ears. The majority of men in New York, particularly  Italians, had moustaches. I didn't see one white male with facial hair in  the whole movie. Generally, the look in the film was more of New York in  the late 80's.On the plus side, the vernacular was fairly true to form.  Most of the New York accents were well done, although there were not enough  of &quot;yeah right&quot; and &quot;fugetaboutit&quot; which was really  quite prevalent back then. We also didn't hear much of New York's trademark  sarcasm. They did use a few words only used in New York like `schkieve' (to  make one's skin crawl, usually with disgust) and `skank' (an ugly woman)  which you normally don't hear in movies.It was really true that for a  while, the restaurant and night club business was in the tank in New York.  Those types of businesses on Long Island saw a surge as a lot of New  Yorkers would go to the Island for entertainment, since Berkowitz was a  city killer. This allusion was never made in the film.The story itself  meandered and seemed content to portray New York life, without really  having much point. There were a few good scenes, such as the one where  Vinny (John Leguizamo) was begging Dionna (Mira Sorvino) not to leave him  as she was packing, but most of the writing was hack and overly  stereotyped. At two and a half hours, it was far too long.John Leguizamo  gave a strong performance, though he looked more Puerto Rican than Italian.  Michael Rispoli plays the New York Italian perfectly (I don't think he has  to do much acting) and his was one of the best performances in the film.  Mira Sorvino was terrific as Vinny's wife. She was just exactly the right  mix of insecure good girl trying not to be so good, and the fuming betrayed  wife. Though her accent wasn't the best, her behavior and mannerisms were  very New York middle class.As for Spike Lee, this was probably the most  mediocre film I've seen by him. He toned down his creative use of the  camera and he wasn't attentive to realistic details that usually mark his  films.I rated this film a 4/10. It was a poor masquerade for a New York  story.",2,A big disappointment,956102400,"04 19, 2000",2000,3599,"['Having', 'grown', 'up', 'Queens', 'NY', 'being', 'Italian', 'male', 'who', 'was', 'single', 'dating', '1977', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'guys', 'being', 'depicted', 'might', 'say', 'was', 'Son', 'Sam', 'quot', 'target', 'demographic', 'quot', 'say', 'was', 'grossly', 'disappointed', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'First', 'film', 'was', 'deftly', 'misrepresented', 'story', '44', 'Caliber', 'Killer', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'really', 'slice', 'New', 'York', 'life', '1977', 'killings', 'served', 'more', 'psychological', 'backdrop', 'story', 'story', 'fact', 'Berkowitz', 'little', 'more', 'treatment', 'here', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees.After', 'resigned', 'fact', 'was', 'really', 'story', 'lives', 'dozen', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'seventies', 'tried', 'enjoy', 'period', 'piece', 'trouble', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'period', 'piece', 'was', 'more', 'caricature', 'New', 'York', 'seventies', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'who', 'usually', 'known', 'stark', 'realism', 'produced', 'lampoon', 'era', 'probably', 'intending', '.As', 'period', 'was', 'hit', 'wardrobe', 'hairstyles', 'were', 'wrong', 'period', 'Bell', 'bottoms', 'were', 'still', 'mainstream', 'style', 'back', 'then', 'burgeoning', 'disco', 'generation', 'hard', 'rockers', 'were', 'majority', 'were', 'not', 'evidence', 'film', 'Punk', 'was', 'very', 'fringe', 'yet', 'was', 'treated', 'were', 'mainstream', 'Hair', 'was', 'styled', 'much', 'longer', 'seldom', 'saw', 'anyone', 'ears', 'majority', 'men', 'New', 'York', 'particularly', 'Italians', 'had', 'moustaches', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'white', 'male', 'facial', 'hair', 'whole', 'movie', 'Generally', 'look', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'New', 'York', 'late', ""80's.On"", 'plus', 'side', 'vernacular', 'was', 'fairly', 'true', 'form', 'Most', 'New', 'York', 'accents', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'quot', 'right', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'prevalent', 'back', 'then', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'much', 'New', 'York', 'trademark', 'sarcasm', 'did', 'use', 'few', 'words', 'only', 'used', 'New', 'York', 'schkieve', 'make', 'one', 'skin', 'crawl', 'usually', 'disgust', 'skank', 'ugly', 'woman', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'movies.It', 'was', 'really', 'true', 'while', 'restaurant', 'night', 'club', 'business', 'was', 'tank', 'New', 'York', 'types', 'businesses', 'Long', 'Island', 'saw', 'surge', 'lot', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'would', 'go', 'Island', 'entertainment', 'Berkowitz', 'was', 'city', 'killer', 'allusion', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'film.The', 'story', 'meandered', 'seemed', 'content', 'portray', 'New', 'York', 'life', 'really', 'having', 'much', 'point', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'such', 'one', 'where', 'Vinny', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'was', 'begging', 'Dionna', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'not', 'leave', 'was', 'packing', 'most', 'writing', 'was', 'hack', 'overly', 'stereotyped', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'long.John', 'Leguizamo', 'gave', 'strong', 'performance', 'looked', 'more', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'Italian', 'Michael', 'Rispoli', 'New', 'York', 'Italian', 'perfectly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'do', 'much', 'acting', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'was', 'terrific', 'Vinny', 'wife', 'was', 'just', 'exactly', 'right', 'mix', 'insecure', 'good', 'girl', 'trying', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'fuming', 'betrayed', 'wife', 'accent', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'behavior', 'mannerisms', 'were', 'very', 'New', 'York', 'middle', 'class.As', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'mediocre', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'toned', 'down', 'creative', 'use', 'camera', 'was', ""n't"", 'attentive', 'realistic', 'details', 'usually', 'films.I', 'rated', 'film', '4/10', 'was', 'poor', 'masquerade', 'New', 'York', 'story']",N/A

514754,A3IDEMHLI9OA03,B00002EQ0F,"G. P. Simon ""Mr. Gfunk""","[2, 2]","Summer of Sam is a film about the events of the last few New York summers of the seventies, and the bizzare killing spree of the .44 caliber killer. But while the portrayal of David Berkowitz is spectacular and, I immagine,  realistic, and while Spike Lee captured the intesity of these events, the  film is not really about the Son of Sam himself.In fact, this film is  probably closer to a film like The Last Days of Disco, than a work like  Silence of the Lambs. And while Son of Sam is the catalyst for much of the  film's action, the decadent freedom of the seventies is the real main  character.Spike Lee does an excelent job of paralleling the madness and  the frenzy of David Berkowitz with that of the disco age in NYC. The  complexity of a generation in the middle of a burnout is also well captured  with a fine attention to detail that is comparable to even that of the New  York kid, Martin Scorcesse, himself. The thing that really surprised me  about the direction was that it was done by Spike Lee. While I do think  Spike's &quot;Joints&quot; are masterful, they have a distinctly different  flavor to them.Overall, this is a powerfully well made film with an  amazing young cast and some of the best &quot;frenzy&quot; cinematography I  have seen in a long time. And while I can find some fault with some of the  finer points of the writing, I wholeheartedly reccoment this film. After  all, how often does the Who's &quot;We won't get fooled again&quot; appear  in a film from 40 Acres and a Mule Productions.Also, watch for Spike's  near perfect, somewhat self deprecating cameo and the one point in the film  where the audience is sudenly forced into the film's  world.MR_GFUNK@YAHOO.COM 3/3/00",4,"Heat Waves, Black Labs, and Disco",952041600,"03 3, 2000",2000,1715,"['Summer', 'Sam', 'film', 'events', 'last', 'few', 'New', 'York', 'summers', 'seventies', 'bizzare', 'killing', 'spree', '.44', 'caliber', 'killer', 'portrayal', 'David', 'Berkowitz', 'spectacular', 'immagine', 'realistic', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'captured', 'intesity', 'events', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'Son', 'Sam', 'himself.In', 'fact', 'film', 'probably', 'closer', 'film', 'Last', 'Days', 'Disco', 'work', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Son', 'Sam', 'catalyst', 'much', 'film', 'action', 'decadent', 'freedom', 'seventies', 'real', 'main', 'character.Spike', 'Lee', 'excelent', 'job', 'paralleling', 'madness', 'frenzy', 'David', 'Berkowitz', 'disco', 'age', 'NYC', 'complexity', 'generation', 'middle', 'burnout', 'also', 'well', 'captured', 'fine', 'attention', 'detail', 'comparable', 'even', 'New', 'York', 'kid', 'Martin', 'Scorcesse', 'thing', 'really', 'surprised', 'direction', 'was', 'was', 'done', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'do', 'think', 'Spike', 'quot', 'Joints', 'quot', 'are', 'masterful', 'have', 'distinctly', 'different', 'flavor', 'them.Overall', 'powerfully', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'amazing', 'young', 'cast', 'best', 'quot', 'quot', 'cinematography', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'find', 'fault', 'finer', 'points', 'writing', 'wholeheartedly', 'reccoment', 'film', 'how', 'often', 'Who', 'quot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'fooled', 'again', 'quot', 'appear', 'film', '40', 'Acres', 'Mule', 'Productions.Also', 'watch', 'Spike', 'near', 'perfect', 'somewhat', 'self', 'deprecating', 'cameo', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'where', 'audience', 'sudenly', 'forced', 'film', 'world.MR_GFUNK', '@', 'YAHOO.COM', '3/3/00']",N/A

514760,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B00002EQ0F,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[1, 4]","Spike Lee's long, flawed, frustrating, and compelling film Summer of Sam deals with the summer of '77 of New York City.  As the city suffers from a sweltering heat wave, a serial killer who calls himself Son of Sam wanders through the night killing dark-haired women.  Punk rock, the newest English import, takes a hold on disenfranchished youth who gather at the Mud Club while the decadent party at Studio 54 enters its own wasteful decline.  This is the society that Lee recreates in this film and if that sounds like a huge subject, it is.  The film often feels disorganized and seems, at times, to be wandering as aimlessly as its leading characters.  But -- so what!?  Spike Lee is one of our greatest filmmakers.  A lot of people dislike Spike Lee -- he's young, rich, arrogant, and cocky.  These are traits that would make a white artist an antihero.  However, an African-American artist is expected to fulfill some sort of white liberal ideal of sainthood and when he fails to live up to the image of Sidney Poitier, he's resented.  Therefore, Lee's films have always been attacked with a certain glee; a hope that Lee will turn out to be untalented.  Summer of Sam was no different.Well, its not a perfect film.  There are flaws -- the huge cast is full of one dimensional characters and the choice of John Leguizamo to play the film's central character -- a womanizing hairdresser wracked with Catholic guilt -- was a huge mistake.  Leguizamo is simply too goofy to be a compelling hero.  As well, the Son of Sam aspect is never credible.  Michael Balducci's performance makes him to obvious a psycho whereas the real of Son of Sam was so disturbing precisely because he looked like any other anonymous nerd.  As well, actually having a dog come on screen and tell him to kill wasn't a good idea.  Especially since the dog speaks with John Turturro's voice.  (Doesn't help that Turturro uses the same accent he used in The Big Lebowski).However, the film features a brilliant performance from Adrien Brody as a former Italian street kid turned punk rocker and especially Mira Sorvino who plays Leguizamo's young wife and has never been sexier or more touchingly vulnerable.  For once, she allows her icy facade to melt away.  But in the end, this film isn't about characters.  Its about New York -- a city that Lee knows and loves.  As a director, Lee knows how to shoot the streets of New York and its Lee's vision of sweltering streets on the verge of exploding that give this film, whatever its flaws, a power that keeps you watching.Lastly, it is true that this was the first film Lee made where the main characters were all white.  This got a lot of attention and no one seemed to realize how truly offensive it was that, with all his obvious ability, the only coverage given to this film was that a black director made a film about white people.  Nobody ever seems troubled when a white director, such as Norman Jewison, presumes to make films about the &quot;black experience&quot; in America -- even though those films inetivably reduce their black characters to bland, comforting stereotypes.  At least Lee is willing to let his white characters come across as human beings.",4,Perhaps Lee's weakest film but still of value,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,3194,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'long', 'flawed', 'frustrating', 'compelling', 'film', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'deals', 'summer', ""'77"", 'New', 'York', 'City', 'city', 'suffers', 'sweltering', 'heat', 'wave', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'Son', 'Sam', 'wanders', 'night', 'killing', 'dark-haired', 'women', 'Punk', 'rock', 'newest', 'English', 'import', 'hold', 'disenfranchished', 'youth', 'who', 'Mud', 'Club', 'decadent', 'party', 'Studio', '54', 'enters', 'own', 'wasteful', 'decline', 'society', 'Lee', 'film', 'huge', 'subject', 'film', 'often', 'disorganized', 'times', 'be', 'wandering', 'as', 'aimlessly', 'leading', 'characters', 'so', 'what', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'one', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'lot', 'people', 'dislike', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'young', 'rich', 'arrogant', 'cocky', 'are', 'traits', 'would', 'make', 'white', 'artist', 'antihero', 'However', 'African-American', 'artist', 'expected', 'fulfill', 'sort', 'white', 'liberal', 'ideal', 'sainthood', 'when', 'live', 'up', 'image', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'resented', 'Therefore', 'Lee', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'attacked', 'certain', 'glee', 'hope', 'Lee', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'untalented', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'was', 'different.Well', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'are', 'flaws', 'huge', 'cast', 'full', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'choice', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'play', 'film', 'central', 'character', 'womanizing', 'hairdresser', 'wracked', 'Catholic', 'guilt', 'was', 'huge', 'mistake', 'Leguizamo', 'simply', 'too', 'goofy', 'be', 'compelling', 'hero', 'As', 'well', 'Son', 'Sam', 'aspect', 'never', 'credible', 'Michael', 'Balducci', 'performance', 'obvious', 'psycho', 'real', 'Son', 'Sam', 'was', 'so', 'disturbing', 'precisely', 'looked', 'other', 'anonymous', 'nerd', 'well', 'actually', 'having', 'dog', 'come', 'screen', 'tell', 'kill', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'idea', 'Especially', 'dog', 'John', 'Turturro', 'voice', ""n't"", 'help', 'Turturro', 'same', 'accent', 'used', 'Big', 'Lebowski', '.However', 'film', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'former', 'Italian', 'street', 'kid', 'turned', 'punk', 'rocker', 'especially', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'who', 'Leguizamo', 'young', 'wife', 'never', 'been', 'sexier', 'more', 'touchingly', 'vulnerable', 'once', 'icy', 'facade', 'melt', 'away', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'characters', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'Lee', 'director', 'Lee', 'how', 'shoot', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'Lee', 'vision', 'sweltering', 'streets', 'verge', 'exploding', 'give', 'film', 'flaws', 'power', 'watching.Lastly', 'true', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'Lee', 'made', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'white', 'got', 'lot', 'attention', 'one', 'seemed', 'realize', 'how', 'truly', 'offensive', 'was', 'obvious', 'ability', 'only', 'coverage', 'given', 'film', 'was', 'black', 'director', 'made', 'film', 'white', 'people', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'troubled', 'when', 'white', 'director', 'such', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'make', 'films', 'quot', 'black', 'experience', 'quot', 'America', 'even', 'films', 'inetivably', 'reduce', 'black', 'characters', 'bland', 'comforting', 'stereotypes', 'least', 'Lee', 'willing', 'let', 'white', 'characters', 'come', 'human', 'beings']",N/A

There is so much in SUMMER OF SAM to absorb, from the truly amazing performances of Mira Sorvino and John Leguizamo, to Spike Lee's multi-layered story, it is almost imperative that you see this film more than once ... In fact, after seeing it in it's inital release, I've rented it two times, and the reason I'm back here ... is to order a copy for my collection ...  Spike Lee does a fantastic job directing this film above and beyond the single story of David Berkowitz ... In fact, the Son of Sam character takes a backseat ( no pun intended :) to the havoc he created, and the lives people lead seperate from these crimes .... The acting is brilliant all around, and I can't stress enough how convincing and passionate Sorvino and Leguizamo are in their roles ...  No, this is not a ""politically correct"" film that all fits neatly together at the end ... This film may not ""go down easy"" as do so many other films ... The killings are graphic, the sex is grapic, and there is alot of great music ... All adding to the impact ...... The one thing I found slightly inaccurate was the implication that the important punk music explosion of 1977 somehow began in England ( an important sub-plot early on ), when in reality, NYC was the home of many a great punk band long before England caught on ...

As someone who was in the city around this time, saw the rise of punk, the deathrows of disco, and lived through the paranoia I recognize a great many things in the  movie. But while this may make for a great walk down memory lane it just  doesn't work as a story. For one thing most of the characters in the movie  are so pathetic they can't hold your interest past the first ten minutes of  the film. They are cardboard cutouts, not real people, like the guests of  Jerry Springer timewarped back to the disco era. We never see the effects  of the Berkowitz slayings on the average person, always through the eyes of  a bunch of misfits. The problem is that these people are so screwed up  apart from events that they don't add to the subject at hand. They'd have  been out of control during the &quot;Summer of Love&quot;, or any other  time.  Most of the people of the city are invisible, unless they are being  shot by Sam, in which case they dutifuly die in gory manner.  In addition  Spike Lee would have done well not to interject himself into the film, as  his reporter on the street bit just doesn't work. The news clips seem  inserted too deliberately, and as a result were for the most part annoying.  The camera work is as dishelveled as the characters, alternating between  the too intimate dialogue and the frenetic madness of SOS with a  hamhandedness which I find astonishing in a director of this experience.  What it most reminded me of is the TV show &quot;Homicide&quot;, that is,  it was derivative.  So if you are interested in seeing a few of the old  cultural markers of the era, such as the swingers club &quot;Plato's  Retreat&quot;, Studio 54, and CBGB indulge yourself.

I was a kid, and I sure as hell was scared to death that summer. Apparently since Son of Sam didn't target young black men, it was a mere backdrop to Spike Lee's frame of consciousness.That's what happens when you're a narcissist (Spike, call your shrink.)This COULD'VE been an excellent movie. Adrien Brody, probably one of the most underrated actors around, once again shows how he can shine in a character role. Unfortunately, the rest of the actors blow (no .44 caliber pun intended.)Mira Sorvino, once again, is one of the most annoying actresses of any generation (""You guys think I'm pretty? I'm pretty, right?"" No, Mira, you aren't, and you have BIG thighs), and I'd turn the gas on if I were John Leguizamo. His role in this movie is basically to hump anything that doesn't move faster than him, and thanks to good ol' Spike, we get to see the gory details.Watching Leguizamo graphically having 86 orgasms is enough to make me consider turning lesbian (just as long as he'd stay away.)I'm sure Leguizamo has a career in films. If they ever redo Saturday Night Fever, he can be the little geek in the platform shoes who knocks up his girlfriend and jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge. Every time Leguizamo came on the screen in this movie, I kept expecting him to follow John Travolta under a ""Stayin' Alive"" backbeat. Leguizamo is THE spitting image of the little jerk who followed Travola around in Saturday Night Fever - but without the geek's redeeming qualities (i.e., I never had to watch the geek have an orgasm.)Aside from the 822 gratuitious sex scenes in this mess, the language actually starts to become an impediment. If Spike Lee was forced to remove the F-word from this movie, the running time would've been 9 minutes.The premise - about all the stuff going on in the area where Son of Sam stalked - is an excellent one. I'm hoping that someone else does a movie about it. Just imagine what a movie with an actual PLOT would've been like!(Spike, call your English teacher.

However,  although Berkowitz' activities form the central backdrop to the story, the  film is far more interesting, presenting as it does more of a snapshot of  neighbourhood life at the time. Director Spike Lee is an acknowledged  master of the genre (whose work is akin to that of Britain's Mike Leigh)  and he utilises the usual elements to reinforce his points. A montage of  genuine footage and news reports interject with the story of John  Leguizamo's (Vinny) adulterous marriage to Mira Sorvino and his best friend  Adrien Brody (Richie, complete with awful English accent early in the  film). Richie is a bi-sexual-by-convenience punk rocker who is totally  misunderstood and eventually outcast by the low-life neighbourhood  wise-guys, ultimately becoming their target as the most likely Son of Sam  suspect. Vinny's divided loyalties to both the local bone-heads in regard  his friend Richie and the consequences of his numerous affairs once  uncovered by his wife nicely heighten the personal tension felt by the  whole community. And the understandable paranoia is all here: the rush for  brunettes to turn blonde overnight (Berkowitx seemed to favour the murder  of dark haired individuals), the local cops forming an unholy alliance with  the neighbourhood Godfather for help in the case, the heat wave and ensuing  blackout that led to widespread looting, fingers being pointed by everyone  at anyone for the most tenuous of reasons. A smouldering melting-pot then  of story-telling, nostalgia and, indeed, fear. Berkowitz' crimes are  summarised by sledgehammer inserts which, although brief, do truly shock  and Lee takes time out to give a brief insight into the madness that  spurned him on, right down to the infamous black dog he purported as  telling him to ""kill, kill, kill""! With a film score utilising Club hits of  the day (disco, disco, disco!), the obligatory punk workout and even some  tracks from The Who (who we could take issue with as being proclaimed ""The  Fathers of Punk"" but as Lee wasn't in the UK when Punk was born we can let  this slide, just this once), there's some nice touches with cameo slots  given over to the Studio 54 and Platos Retreat scenes.  All in all, this is  another solid accomplishment from Lee that not only does justice to a  number of entwining stories but is also an accomplished piece of nostalgia.  Way above average, this definitely deserves two hours of your attention.

Do the right thing was ""good"" and for its time real good.  But that's about it.  And too much cussing and graphic sex in Spikes brain makes it into his movies.Now this SOS, not only is it his best movie by far, but it is in my top 10 of all time of all movies.  The extreme of it is over the top, but if you are going to make a dark movie, and I have never ever seen a dark movie I like, then this was the one to do it in.BUT this as a top 10 off all time is mostly based on the all around acting of everyone, spliced in with Spikes timing of the scenes, the music timing with the scenes changing, and Spikes use of coloring ( no not people) in his movies give it the perfect all around touch.When you watch this movie, for best effects, you MUST have the closed captioned on.  For one, as per the norm in Spikes movies, there are at many times 2 people talking almost at once, if not at once.  And also per the norm of Spikes movies there are many things that are happening outside of camera shots, in the background, etc.  So you need this on to fully catch the whole movie, plus I am a believer that reading it while listening to a movie drags you into it even more.The music, I have never seen a movie, ever, that splices songs in so perfect with the scenes of the movie.  The Who songs this happens twice, and at the end it's probably one of the best all around combined endings of all time in a movie, music, the clips of whats happening, and the timing of everything as it all goes down, all the way to the last note, just flat out stunning.  Rewind it a couple times after the songs.Use a good headset, mine are Seenhieser 595's.  the cost $$$$ but so worth it for the best experience.Also to fully bring in everything I just said, you must watch this movie in the dark, and you must turn it as loud as you can stand it when the music plays.  Keeping the volume near max when the movie on is a must, but when the music comes on, esp at the end, max it out.  If a few candles are your thing the light them up, but the room needs to be dark.  And other than a bathroom break if you really need it, do NOT stop the movie, its one that you need to stay ""in it"" so it draws you in deeper.  If you have kids, not only have someone else take them in for the movie so you dont get any interuptions, be it babies or whatever.  But also do NOT let kids of any age see this, its to much for them.  I wouldnt let anyone under 18 see it, call me a prude or whatever, this movie is just to dark.pay close attention to the one song on stage where they take words from one of Son of Sams letters and make it into a song, its a punk song.That scence when the dog comes into his apt, near the end, and ""talks"" to him.  total trip.The cemetery fight/argument scene with Vinny and his wife, in the red mustang, by far one of the best scenes from a woman ever, she tells him like it is, and its so true in real life the way men are and what they need to hear, and hear it good she gives it haha.and lastly, and yes I have seen it sober and its almost just as good, but for this type of dark movie get your favorite substance going just before the movie and keep it going all thought the movie, by the time the finality of this movie hits, the music, the timing with it and all, the pace of the clips, blasting the whole time, your jaw will be on your chest, or even on the floor haha.Is most of the subject matters real?  does Spike have to much of some kind of bone to pick with the Italians?  is this movie half fiction half non?  Well for someone who hates fiction, as in I just dont see the time spent on fiction good time spent, ( I dont need temp leaves of reality)  or whatever you want to call it for people that like fiction.  In any event, all that when you add up the whole movie, who cares, a movie just a movie!  probably all of them twist plots here and there for the sake of keeping people entertained.  but for this movie, Its just to well put together, watch it 2-3 times for full effect, and do it like i said, and then you will see.  Have fun! hahaListened with Sennheiser 595's, the best that I have found, had 555 for a couple years they are nice too, but cant touch 595's, pay the dif and see, er I mean hear.",5,"CHANGE OF REVIEW

Perhaps some of the Disco, and Punk Rock scenes were used as ""fillers"" and some the sex shots also.The film was mainly about the hysteria surrounding a serial killer on the loose in 1977, but also I believe Mr. Lee was conveying another message such as how many people are trapped in the role they have to play in life that society dictates.Example, when Vinnie (Leguizamo) tells Ritchie (Brody) ""Look at you, you are wearing a dog collar!"" Ritchie responds by saying, ""So are you, you are on a leash!"" In other words, Vinnie has to act a certain way because he is a Catholic Italian, and for that matter commits adultery because he supposedly cannot perform certain sexual acts with his wife because its against his religion. Ritchie, even though being Italian is rejected by his own people because he looks and dresses different. The other Italian men in the neighborhood have to act like ""mobsters"", and go on a mission to catch this killer because that is what is expected. If one wants to be part of things, they must act a certain way, and there is no freedom of choice.Spike Lee makes a point to remind every one that there is prejudice and ignorance among every culture, and in this movie he chose Italians. Of course, he had to throw his two cents in the  movie making comments such as if the killer was murdering Blacks no one would be making a big deal, but that's Spike Lee for you.

And there was a serial killer on the loose. Against this backdrop, this is the story of an Italian American couple in the Bronx (John Leguizamo as Vinny and Mira Sorvino as Dionna) and their crumbling marriage. When their friend Richie (Adrien Brody) starts to get involved with the punk scene he is looked at as weird. Everything in this movie is exaggerated.  There is a brashness of atmosphere and color, a comedic quality to the dialog, an exaggeration of characterization.  All this is viewed through the eye of Spike Lee's camera. It never seems real.  But that might not be his intention.  As we all know the story of the postal worker who was eventually caught and convicted of the murders, there is no real dramatic tension regarding the hunt for the killer.  The violence captures the mood of the times, and explains some the paranoia that gripped the City. The soundtrack, comprised of disco favorites such as ""The Dancing Queen"" and ""Don't Leave Me This Way,"" were creative punctuation as the story unfolded, a story that was less the story of a serial killer, and more the story of an era that has passed into New York City history.",5,Sex!

514779,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00002EQ0F,Matthew Horner,"[4, 7]","In 1977, New York City was terrorized by a serial killer who called himself the Son of Sam. He would prowl the streets of the Bronx area and shot young people parked in their cars. This psychopath, who taunted the police by mailing letters to a local journalist, became the object of the biggest manhunt in the city's history. His real name was David Berkowitz, and he was apprehended in the summer of 1977.Summer of Sam is not directly about this infamous man. We see him, but we never get to know him. Instead, we met some young people who live in the neighborhood. The focus is on Vinny and Dionna [John Leguizamo and Mira Sorvino], who have been married for a couple of years. He has been notoriously unfaithful to her, a fact she is just now picking up on. Vinny is presented as a victim of his environment. In his Italian-American neighborhood, a man is a man, and all women are not created equal. He has been taught to set a strict standard for what his wife should be asked to do sexually. For pleasures outside this code, there are other women. Vinny isn't bright enough to see that all of this is mere justification for his womanizing, but after accidentally seeing two of Sam's victims, he does believe God is about to strike him dead. He cannot share his fears with Dionna, because he was with another woman that particular night.We also met the local rebel. Ritchie [Adrien Brody] hangs out a lot in Manhattan, where he is trying to become a punk rocker. His spiked hair, leather gear and outrageous clothing have upset the guys he grew up with, They seem obsessed with fitting in to a mold, despite the fact that they were born into the most culturally diverse city in America. His appearance is nothing compared to his bizarre way of making money. He also has a somewhat twisted relationship with the street's most promiscuous girl, Ruby [Jennifer Esposito].What director Spike Lee concentrates on is the effect the Son of Sam has on the actions and the thought patterns of these young adults, as well as on New Yorkers in general. He partly succeeds in his efforts. His portrayal of the paranoia these people develop is well done. Showing how a mob mentality develops also works. Lee fails on a deeper level, when he trues to convince us that Sam was simply a madman in a world gone mad - society's victim. The problem I have with this viewpoint is that I believe the world has always been mad, but the actions of a serial killer remain an aberration. There is an enormous difference between having dark fantasies and acting on them. If this weren't true, we'd have wiped ourselves out a few thousand years ago.There is another weaknesses in the story line. In general, when a plot has people doing different things in different places, their paths should literally cross at some point. This never really happens in Son of Sam. While we are often affected by people we never met in real life, this fact is hard to portray in a movie. Here, the result seems to be two different movies happening at once.

New York cliches and stereotypes are his trademarks. Every single one of his films has them and frankly they're quite accurate a lot of times. If you don't like it I suggest you stay away from his movies. 'Summer of Sam' is, in my opinion, Lee's most underrated film. It's set during a crazy time in NYC - the volatile summer of 1977. We're talking the mid-July citywide blackout; Studio 54; Yankees first World Series victory in 15 years; Mario Cuomo; Jimmy Breslin; and of course serial killer David Berkowitz aka Son of Sam. The focus of Lee's film is primarily three main characters in a Bronx Italian neighborhood --- Vinny (Leguizamo) is a hairdresser who can't keep his dk in his pants even though he's married to ultra-sexy Dionna (Sorvino). His paisan from the neighborhood, Richie (Brody), is part of the rising punk scene with a few personal issues issues of his own. The backdrop is the NYPD hunt for the notorious .44 Caliber Killer. One great scene that stands out the most is when two detectives (Turturro, Guenveur Smith) approach a local Cosa Nostra capo (Gazzara) for assistance catching him by reading a chilling letter outloud originally sent to columnist Jimmy Breslin of the NY Daily News from the SOS himself.'Summer of Sam' has its flaws, no doubt. It seems to hop around a lot which can come off unbalanced. Some of the depictions of Berkowitz himself are over-the-top and inaccurate. But it's got Lee written all over it - from the superb soundtrack to the hilarious news footage scenes. The DVD itself is unfortunately poor quality a blu-ray would be great.

Lee is one of the few  filmakers that was able to really capture that &quot;vibe&quot; or  &quot;feel&quot; of the 70's, and NY in the summertime in particular (the  only other movie to do so was Boogie Nights). He didn't just slap some  plaid on some actors and make this a slasher/action film. Instead his focus  is on characterization. And what characters!John Leguizamo gives an  incredible performance as the cheating lothario who has an epiphany when a  couple is murdered by Berkowitz in the exact spot where he was having a  &quot;rendezous&quot; just minutes before!He becomes obsessed w/Berkowitz's  killing rampage &amp; swears off cheating, but is to weak not to give into  temptation. It's a crime that Leguizamo wasn't nominated for best actor, he  gives such a compelling performance.Lee also captured that often elusive  feel of a country in the midst of change, as was the U.S. at the end of the  70's.He creatively introduces a neighborhood kid who returns to NY sporting  a mohawk &amp; punk gear in the middle of the disco era.His suburban punk  attitude clashes w/his friends who are desperatly clinging to their old  italian ways.All the while these characters interact, their stories are  given the background of the Son of Sam's killing spree. We see Berkowitz  only in shadows and in frantic clips, mostly spouting unitelligble ravings  and screaming at the next door neighbors continually barking dog(presumably  the one he supposedly heard voices from that told him to kill all of his  victims).Again, the movie is so complex and Lee has so many interesting  characters and subplots running all at once that he creates a crazy quilt  of a film that reflects a crazy time in recent American history!Excellent!",4,Lee captures the SUMMER perfectly!,960422400,"06 8, 2000",2000,2075,"['Summer', 'Sam', 'far', 'best', 'work', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'even', 'better', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'travesty', 'film', 'was', 'overlooked', '1999', 'Oscars', 'when', 'films', '6th', 'Sense', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'tragi-comdey', 'American', 'Beauty', 'made', 'cut.This', 'film', 'works', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'impossible', 'thoroughly', 'review', 'do', 'justice', 'Lee', 'one', 'few', 'filmakers', 'was', 'able', 'really', 'capture', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'feel', 'quot', '70', 'NY', 'summertime', 'particular', 'only', 'other', 'movie', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'slap', 'plaid', 'actors', 'make', 'slasher/action', 'film', 'Instead', 'focus', 'characterization', 'what', 'characters', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'incredible', 'performance', 'cheating', 'lothario', 'who', 'epiphany', 'when', 'couple', 'murdered', 'Berkowitz', 'exact', 'spot', 'where', 'was', 'having', 'quot', 'rendezous', 'quot', 'just', 'minutes', 'before', 'obsessed', 'w/Berkowitz', 'killing', 'rampage', 'amp', 'swears', 'cheating', 'weak', 'not', 'give', 'temptation', 'crime', 'Leguizamo', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'compelling', 'performance.Lee', 'also', 'captured', 'often', 'elusive', 'feel', 'country', 'midst', 'change', 'was', 'U.S.', 'end', ""70's.He"", 'creatively', 'neighborhood', 'kid', 'who', 'NY', 'sporting', 'mohawk', 'amp', 'punk', 'gear', 'middle', 'disco', 'era.His', 'suburban', 'punk', 'attitude', 'w/his', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'desperatly', 'clinging', 'old', 'italian', 'characters', 'interact', 'stories', 'are', 'given', 'background', 'Son', 'Sam', 'killing', 'spree', 'see', 'Berkowitz', 'only', 'shadows', 'frantic', 'clips', 'mostly', 'spouting', 'unitelligble', 'ravings', 'screaming', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'continually', 'barking', 'dog', 'presumably', 'one', 'supposedly', 'heard', 'voices', 'told', 'kill', 'victims', '.Again', 'movie', 'so', 'complex', 'Lee', 'so', 'many', 'interesting', 'characters', 'subplots', 'running', 'once', 'crazy', 'quilt', 'film', 'crazy', 'time', 'recent', 'American', 'history', 'Excellent']",N/A

She just didn't have enough to do and her role wasn't sufficient. Dionna and Vinnie have no chemistry.  You never really found out what Vinnie's sex-on-the side life had to do with the movie...I'm realizing nothing. Adrian Brody was wonderful as always.

After the first thirty minutes of the film the movie turned into another "" Crooklyn "" or "" School Daze "" showing the old Spike Lee flavor. There is nothing wrong with the old flavor but with such A-list actors and such an intense story to follow up on, Summer of Sam falls short.  It's full of exciting scenes but these are the same scenes that are not needed.  The story drifted off the subject too often it lost its impact. I didn't appreciate the baffling camera movements, they only took away from the story. And by the way...was Spike Lee trying to prove how many times he could use the F word?

This movie was definitely a mixed bag from my point  of view, despite the first-rate direction of Spike Lee, the great pop/disco  soundtrack, and the way the Summer of 1977 is caught on film.  The dancing  sequences are a definite plus (Sorvino had to have some sort of  appreciation for her moves).  Nonetheless, the length and constant  vulgarity (both of which usually don't bother me) catch up with all things  rendered and only pass for a mediocre movie experience.  Two more negative  reactions from the movie is the film's all-too-strong violence (point-blank  shootings) and sex scenes (shooting in a more-than-I-wanna-know style).The movie surrounds a group of friends in the Bronx, centering on the  main character, Vinny, whose constant cheating and lackluster lifestyle has  him thinking the Gods are working against him, and that he very well may be  the Son of Sam's next victim.  Mira Sorvino does her best with her role as  Dionna, Vinny's wife, but only succeeds to a certain level.  Adrien Brody  plays the bisexual (or homosexual--we never really find out) friend of  Vinny who returns from Manhattan as a punk-rocker that displeases his  friends he grew up with.  Long story longer, this movie tries to please but  comes short.  I myself tend to like films like this where it captures a  time frame well and is presenting a story of flawed people, but all things  apparent still do not make this a very good or excellent movie.  It is  Spike Lee's best film since Malcolm X, but still, he could do a lot better  and could have done a lot better with this movie.I watched the film on  TV and was glad I punished myself to see it on TV so I would have to sit  and watch the whole thing.

514789,A2ZBOH5GSJT5SJ,B00002EQ0F,"""petyko""","[1, 3]","As always I was impressed by Spike Lee's directing style.  He does have a very effective way of generating a lot of &quot;sound and fury&quot;, but in this movie his characters really do come across more as fools than  tragic characters.  While I wouldn't say that it &quot;signifies  nothing&quot;, I would have to conclude that it signifies very little, and  basically expends a tremendous amount of energy in support of a few,  not-very-original social and psychological motifs.I must admit that  the &quot;feel&quot; of the movie (and much of this aura is generated by an  endless stream of vulgar language and soft porn) is quite impressive.  His  objective, as I understand it, was to convey the extreme social and psychic  tension brought about during the summer of 1977 in NYC, partly by the Son  of Sam murders and partly by the torturous heat wave that hit the city that  year.  I think he succeeds very well in communicating this in a sensual  way.  Most of his characters in this movie are caricatures and he uses them  nicely to play into this grand portrait of a city &quot;boiling over.&quot;  But all this is only amusing for a while, and even then, only marginally.  It really didn't give me any unique insights into social dynamics, per se,  and certainly didn't explore individual human problems in a very mature  light.  All in all, while it was a rather stunning display of directorial  virtuosity, it really wasn't much more than a parade of walking shadows  that did a whole lot of strutting and fretting.  I do agree with many of  the other reviewers who compliment Lee on his ability to accurately portray  the ""feel"" of New York life, as well as conveying some of the lost sights  and sounds of bygone era. In this sense, the movie really was a feast for  the eyes and ears.  But I don't consider that portion of our country's  history particularly significant - if it has value, it's limited to  superficial sparkle.  I also agree that the acting was energetic and often  captivating.  But again, it seemed like a lot of superb talent wasted on  pointless material.  I don't agree that his portrayals captured the  complexity of the inhabitants of our most complex American city.  In fact,  I don't think he intended to.  Finally, his portrayals do help to break  down social stereotypes - after all, it was the spike-haired, punk-rockin',  bisexual exhibitionist of the movie who came across as having the greatest  honesty, compassion and geniune character.  In this, the movie was true  Spike Lee.So I recommend Summer of Sam only to those interested in Lee's  directorial style and his flare for choreographing interpersonal conflict.  For the viewer, like myself, who is looking for the sort of serious  insights provided by his earlier triumphs like Mo' Better Blues and Jungle  Fever, not to mention the epic character analysis of Malcolm X, I don't  think there's much of that here.",2,"A feast for the senses, but not for the intellect",947203200,"01 7, 2000",2000,2917,"['always', 'was', 'impressed', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'directing', 'style', 'have', 'very', 'effective', 'way', 'generating', 'lot', 'quot', 'sound', 'fury', 'quot', 'movie', 'characters', 'really', 'do', 'come', 'across', 'more', 'fools', 'tragic', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'quot', 'signifies', 'nothing', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'conclude', 'very', 'little', 'basically', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'energy', 'support', 'few', 'not-very-original', 'social', 'psychological', 'motifs.I', 'must', 'admit', 'quot', 'feel', 'quot', 'movie', 'much', 'aura', 'generated', 'endless', 'stream', 'vulgar', 'language', 'soft', 'porn', 'quite', 'impressive', 'objective', 'understand', 'was', 'convey', 'extreme', 'social', 'psychic', 'tension', 'brought', 'summer', '1977', 'NYC', 'partly', 'Son', 'Sam', 'murders', 'partly', 'torturous', 'heat', 'wave', 'hit', 'city', 'year', 'think', 'very', 'well', 'communicating', 'sensual', 'way', 'Most', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'caricatures', 'nicely', 'play', 'grand', 'portrait', 'city', 'quot', 'boiling', 'over.', 'quot', 'only', 'amusing', 'while', 'even', 'then', 'only', 'marginally', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'unique', 'insights', 'social', 'dynamics', 'se', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'explore', 'individual', 'human', 'problems', 'very', 'mature', 'light', 'was', 'rather', 'stunning', 'display', 'directorial', 'virtuosity', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'parade', 'walking', 'shadows', 'did', 'whole', 'lot', 'strutting', 'fretting', 'do', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'compliment', 'Lee', 'ability', 'accurately', 'portray', 'feel', 'New', 'York', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'conveying', 'lost', 'sights', 'sounds', 'bygone', 'era', 'sense', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'feast', 'eyes', 'ears', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'portion', 'country', 'history', 'particularly', 'significant', 'value', 'limited', 'superficial', 'sparkle', 'also', 'agree', 'acting', 'was', 'energetic', 'often', 'captivating', 'again', 'seemed', 'lot', 'superb', 'talent', 'wasted', 'pointless', 'material', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'portrayals', 'captured', 'complexity', 'inhabitants', 'most', 'complex', 'American', 'city', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'intended', 'Finally', 'portrayals', 'do', 'help', 'break', 'down', 'social', 'stereotypes', 'was', 'spike-haired', 'punk-rockin', 'bisexual', 'exhibitionist', 'movie', 'who', 'came', 'having', 'greatest', 'honesty', 'compassion', 'geniune', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'true', 'Spike', 'Lee.So', 'recommend', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'only', 'interested', 'Lee', 'directorial', 'style', 'flare', 'choreographing', 'interpersonal', 'conflict', 'viewer', 'who', 'looking', 'sort', 'serious', 'insights', 'provided', 'earlier', 'triumphs', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'not', 'mention', 'epic', 'character', 'analysis', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'here']",N/A
514790,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00002EQ0F,P Magnum,"[4, 6]","Summer of Sam is Spike Lee's take on the true story of how the serial killer David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam, placed New York City in the grip of fear during 1977.  The movie is not a look at Berkowitz himself, but at an Italian-American community in the Bronx.  The two central characters are Vinnie and Richie played by John Leguizamo and Adrian Brody respectively.  Vinnie is married Dionna (Mira Sorvino), but he is wildly unfaithful to her.  This is a source of confusion for Vinnie, because of his religion, he wants to be faithful to his wife, but he thinks it's a sin to do all the wild...acts he performs with the girls he sleeps with.  Richie had left the neighborhood, but recently came back. He is virtually unrecognizable to the guys in the hood as he is a punk rocker with incredible spiked hair and he has taken up an English accent.  Richie and the neighborhood [girl], Ruby (Jennifer Espisito) start going together and he introduces her in his bizarre world of playing in a punk rock band and dancing in a...theater.  All this happens with the Son of Sam killings as a backdrop.  Not only were the killings happening that summer, but the City was gripped by the biggest heatwave in history and an infamous blackout.  Despite a spirited performance by Mr. Leguizamo, the film never really succeeds.  The convoluted plot on how the semi-mob related guys in the neighborhood think Richie is the Son of Sam never rings true or seems believable.  Certain characters like Anthony LaPaglia's cop who is investigating the killings appear and then disappear without adding much to the plot.  Mr. Lee does do a great job of intertwine actual footage and events into the film and the closing scene when Berkowitz (played by The Practice's Michael Badalucco) is captured and brought into the station and the guys are hunting down Richie is intense and exhilaratingly set to The Who's ""Won't Get Fooled Again"".

Where is the man who was able to mix militant political views with fantastic drama to give us School Daze and Do the Right Thing, two of the best films ever made? I don't know where he went, but the shadow left in his wake who's handed us the last bunch of godawful films with Lee's name on them ain't the same guy. Hopefully, Summer of Sam is the nadir, and he can get back to being himself. For one thing, in the early days, Lee's acting was always one of the highlights of his films, and in Summer of Sam, it's almost as if he was trying his best to act badly. (If so, he succeeded in fine form.) And forget that there might have been any other explanation for the killings (Lee obviously did). Add in a plot about the ways that peoples' opinions change about one another and how fickle &#34;loyalty&#34; can be and you have all the makings of a disaster. The worst part is, this is stuff that Lee handled more than capably in his better films, and one is left wondering whether to blame the director or the scriptwriters for the mess this film is.

It shifted me through  many angles. First, it's exhilarating and interesting, then it slows down  and drags on, then it gets good again. The problem here is two things: The  writing and editing. For a screenplay that went through three writers  (including Lee), it seems like a first draft, it doesn't keep the interest  up like it should. Maybe &quot;Summer Of Sam&quot; would have been an even  greater film had there been a re-edit, some scenes seem to go on too long.  Even the profanity gets boring since it seems to be in every sentence.  Still, I must be clear, this is a good and convincing movie. Maybe it  doesn't keep your interest on fire, but it still manages to show talent.  The cinematography is feverish and hyper, the disco-club scenes are  electric and exhilarating. John Leguizamo and Mira Sorvino give great  performances that manage to keep us believing the characters. The  soundtrack sizzles off the screen and adds more mood to great scenes.

Ithought the actors and characters were great (john leguizamo, the punk(forget his name), the guidoey dudes in the neighborhood).  They were somewhat caricatures, as many spike lee characters are.  In his last two movies (girl 6 and this) he's gotten into exploring sex in a whole new way, much more perverse.  Vinny's dilemma can be funny, (&quot;You, know, b--f----ing? &quot;) but his frustration and despair are also quite relatable. Same goes for the punk, who amazingly retains the most clear image of himself and who he is, while he lives through multiple phacads.  The movie revolves around the people, not the murders.  Just as Do The Right Thing showed a tense situation blowing up with a catalyst being a radio, so this movie has a killer in the background who actually does not affect any of the characters who lets the mounting tensions in the neighborhood through the hot summer blow up the situation.  The visuals are excellent.  It's violent and sexy at times. The soundtrack is good, and excellently placed.  Overall, I find Spike Lee is underrated as a filmmaker.

Nevertheless, most agree that urban America during those years saw a significant increase in loose, morally  reprehensible behavior, from rampant hard drug use to widespread casual  anonymous sex.  The full impact of the 1960s experience struck during the  '70s, as the usual brakes on human behavior (weakened by the challenges of  the '60s) proved inadequate during the '70s.  Spike Lee's Summer of Sam has  a distinct moral framework that is highly critical of 1970s behavior.  All  the sins of sex, drugs, and racism come home to haunt their practitioners  as the David Berkowitz aka the Son of Sam inflicts a sort of moral  retribution on New York City at large.  People pursuing sexual liasons in  automobiles, lootings during the blackout, one of the main characters has  an extramarital affair at the site of a future Berkowitz killing--all  immoral actions are pursued by the Son of Sam, throwing the city into a  panic.  The fact that Spike Lee shows Berkowitz himself only in shadowy  environments helps the viewer perceive the Son of Sam more as an avenging  angel (devil?) instead of as a sick human being.  Consider as well the fact  that the viewer never actually sees Berkowitz's face during any of the  murders.  After the blackout lootings in Brooklyn, the Son of Sam strikes  in Brookly for the first time.  Immorality being pursued and stamped out,  urban American style, is the provacative centerpiece of Summer of Sam.",4,Moral Retribution,963964800,"07 19, 2000",2000,1546,"['Many', 'people', 'have', 'own', 'memories', '1970', 'what', ""'70s"", 'were', 'really', 'like', 'what', 'were', ""n't"", 'Nevertheless', 'most', 'agree', 'urban', 'America', 'years', 'saw', 'significant', 'increase', 'loose', 'morally', 'reprehensible', 'behavior', 'rampant', 'hard', 'drug', 'use', 'widespread', 'casual', 'anonymous', 'sex', 'full', 'impact', '1960s', 'experience', 'struck', ""'70s"", 'usual', 'brakes', 'human', 'behavior', 'weakened', 'challenges', ""'60s"", 'proved', 'inadequate', ""'70s"", 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'distinct', 'moral', 'framework', 'highly', 'critical', '1970s', 'behavior', 'sins', 'sex', 'drugs', 'racism', 'come', 'home', 'haunt', 'practitioners', 'David', 'Berkowitz', 'Son', 'Sam', 'sort', 'moral', 'retribution', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'large', 'People', 'pursuing', 'sexual', 'liasons', 'automobiles', 'lootings', 'blackout', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'site', 'future', 'Berkowitz', 'killing', 'immoral', 'actions', 'are', 'pursued', 'Son', 'Sam', 'throwing', 'city', 'panic', 'fact', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Berkowitz', 'only', 'shadowy', 'environments', 'viewer', 'perceive', 'Son', 'Sam', 'more', 'avenging', 'angel', 'devil', 'instead', 'sick', 'human', 'being', 'Consider', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'viewer', 'never', 'actually', 'Berkowitz', 'face', 'murders', 'blackout', 'lootings', 'Brooklyn', 'Son', 'Sam', 'strikes', 'Brookly', 'first', 'time', 'Immorality', 'being', 'pursued', 'stamped', 'out', 'urban', 'American', 'style', 'provacative', 'centerpiece', 'Summer', 'Sam']",N/A

I grew up around people like this so it's ammusing to me, and reminds me somewhat of my own family.  I love Adrain Brody's character, Richie.  I thought he did an amazing job.
