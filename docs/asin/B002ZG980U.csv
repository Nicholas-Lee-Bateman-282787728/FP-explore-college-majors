1304810,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B002ZG980U,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[4, 16]","Now the movie was hailed as a masterpiece BEFORE hardly anybody saw it including most film critics. Is it? Time will tell but I doubt it. Except for some ingenious editing, the movie ain't all that. Inception seems vastly over-hyped and will diminish in stature over the years after the Hollywood propaganda mill and glowing blurbs and buzz promoting ads have faded away. And after YOUR first impression.On this euphoric reception David Edelstein says, ""It's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and--hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype--a metaphor for itself"". Anyway, great controversy erupted over dissenting reviews, especially Edelstein's.My favorite thing about this movie is the conversation it spawned, or rather the subject it's reception generated interesting commentaries on.Recommended reading: The brilliant Jim Emerson's blog Scanners and his multiple entries on Inception, especially ""On Liking and Not Liking"". Emerson focuses on actual arguments.ALSO: ""Seventeen Ways of Criticizing 'Inception'"" right here-->[...]Upon first viewing I enjoyed the visuals but realized I'm (as with many people) less phased by new special effects than I used to be. I recall years ago being in awe of cutting edge effects. No longer. I'm simply expecting incredible effects to be a standard for any decent fantasy/sci-fi flick.I enjoyed the cast and some action sequences were fantastic.I found the logic(?)highly dubious if not incomprehensible, even tho _most of the movie consists of characters supposedly explaining the movie_.I feel the dream worlds are way too literal. WHY are these dream worlds ""constructed"" the way they are again? Why do....NEVER MIND. Asking why will lead to an infinite regression of whys and no doubt the internet will contain years of analysis explaining Inception.The plot really is absurd--not that absurd is always necessarily 'bad'. But I'll just say I am not fascinated by the epistemological puzzle. It seems we as viewers of the film are supposed to be and to the extent we are then--personally for ME anyway--Inception is a failure. Is he dreaming still? Who's dream is it?

1304811,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B002ZG980U,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[239, 314]","`Inception' is a hard movie to judge.  Basically, it is a mind-bender, and as such should be judged by two criteria:  How good of a mind-bender is it? And, How much does it create a  realm of its own with phenomena and rules of causality that work consistently?In my mind `Inception,' despite some derivative elements, is an inventive movie that provides mind-enveloping reactions well after the viewing is over.  Much like Lynch's `Inland Empire' before it, the movie coalesces well into one's imagination and lingers in the mind for days to come.Being brief with the story is difficult, and I'm sure by now you've probably digested a great deal of material elsewhere.  Washed up on an Asian seashore, American businessman, Cobb (Di Caprio) meets with an elderly leader to obtain a contract and  defeat his enemies.  To accomplish this, he offers to perform an ""extraction,"" a means of obtaining secrets from a person`s subconscious during one's dream life.  In the midst of their negotiations, an entire village riots and takes over the building where they meet, and Cobb and his sidekick, Arthur, (Gordon-Levitt) fight and flee to save their lives....In this beginning scene the lines are partially drawn between dreams and awakening, but the surrealistic landscape also provides Nolan ample opportunities to provide his trademark action-adventure for his science fiction saga.Cobb later meets an old professor (Caine) who sagely links him to a prodigy student, Ariadne, (Page) who can assist him with his next assignment and help straighten out his perspective and proper use of inceptions, or the use of subliminal persuasion, participating in another's subconscious perceptions and manipulating them during their dreams.  In their first assignment together, he plans to have a rich man's son and heir, Robert Fischer (Murphy) change his mind about his father's will, so he will be able to either obtain or sabotage his inheritance.There are dreams, and there are dreams within dreams, and one of Cobb's plans is to have three levels of dreaming going on at once to have the most persuasive power on Fisher.Intertwined are revelations from Cobb's subconscious, revealed with Ariadne, who joins him on his subliminal journey and witnesses some of his life-changing events with his wife (Cotillard).  In a partial revelation, Cobb admits he included his wife in some of his dream work with complications that has created strife in their relationship.As you might imagine, problems develop that make the operation work less neatly and easily as planned, so discerning what level of dreaming and what level of reality are taking place also becomes blurred.  The exposition and details are laid out more concretely than Lynch's worlds, but the caveats others have placed about paying attention are well founded.Besides the mood of mind-benders like Lynch's `Mulholland Drive,' Nolan has borrowed and alchemized elements from inventive movies like the truly excellent Japanese anime' adventure `Paprika' and movies like 'The Cell,' but the results are truly new and effective.I have to admit my biases.  I love mind-benders, and it's no accident that Christopher Nolan and David Lynch are at the top of my list of favorite directors.  This creates a problem because if you love mind-benders as a rule, it is sometimes difficult to separate effective works from those that don't work as well.I was originally wavering between four and five stars for this film based on the ending.  I'll give no details for that, but, I've decided, like 'Inland Empire' before it, `Inception' may seem abrupt, but its import as a surrealistic experience is nearly as mind-altering.  'Inception' deserves attention, awards, multiple viewings, and the time needed for a truly rewarding film experience.  If you love Lynch's work, you will probably also love 'Inception,' but one could concede this movie isn`t as effective at playing with your noodle. On the other hand, if you find Lynch's films to be frustrating or too abstract, then Nolan's 'Inception' may give you a more satisfying sense of concreteness and closure overall.(Tom Berenger and Ken Watanabe join an outstanding cast for a taut movie experience.)(Some loose ends of `Inception' have been tightened from information from imdb.)",5,"""An Elegant Solution for Keeping Track of Reality""",1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,4274,"['Inception', 'hard', 'movie', 'judge', 'Basically', 'mind-bender', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'two', 'criteria', 'How', 'good', 'mind-bender', 'How', 'much', 'create', 'realm', 'own', 'phenomena', 'rules', 'causality', 'work', 'consistently', 'mind', 'Inception', 'derivative', 'elements', 'inventive', 'movie', 'mind-enveloping', 'reactions', 'well', 'viewing', 'Much', 'Lynch', 'Inland', 'Empire', 'movie', 'well', 'one', 'imagination', 'lingers', 'mind', 'days', 'come.Being', 'brief', 'story', 'difficult', ""'m"", 'sure', 'now', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'digested', 'great', 'deal', 'material', 'elsewhere', 'Washed', 'up', 'Asian', 'seashore', 'American', 'businessman', 'Cobb', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'elderly', 'leader', 'obtain', 'contract', 'defeat', 'enemies', 'accomplish', 'perform', 'extraction', 'means', 'obtaining', 'secrets', 'person', 's', 'subconscious', 'one', 'dream', 'life', 'midst', 'negotiations', 'entire', 'village', 'riots', 'building', 'where', 'meet', 'Cobb', 'sidekick', 'Arthur', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'fight', 'flee', 'save', 'lives', 'beginning', 'scene', 'lines', 'are', 'partially', 'drawn', 'dreams', 'awakening', 'surrealistic', 'landscape', 'also', 'Nolan', 'ample', 'opportunities', 'provide', 'trademark', 'action-adventure', 'science', 'fiction', 'saga.Cobb', 'later', 'old', 'professor', 'Caine', 'who', 'sagely', 'prodigy', 'student', 'Ariadne', 'Page', 'who', 'can', 'assist', 'next', 'assignment', 'help', 'straighten', 'out', 'perspective', 'proper', 'use', 'inceptions', 'use', 'subliminal', 'persuasion', 'participating', 'subconscious', 'perceptions', 'manipulating', 'dreams', 'first', 'assignment', 'together', 'have', 'rich', 'man', 'son', 'heir', 'Robert', 'Fischer', 'Murphy', 'change', 'mind', 'father', 'will', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'obtain', 'sabotage', 'inheritance.There', 'are', 'dreams', 'are', 'dreams', 'dreams', 'one', 'Cobb', 'plans', 'have', 'three', 'levels', 'dreaming', 'going', 'once', 'have', 'most', 'persuasive', 'power', 'Fisher.Intertwined', 'are', 'revelations', 'Cobb', 'subconscious', 'revealed', 'Ariadne', 'who', 'subliminal', 'journey', 'life-changing', 'events', 'wife', 'Cotillard', 'partial', 'revelation', 'Cobb', 'included', 'wife', 'dream', 'work', 'complications', 'created', 'strife', 'relationship.As', 'might', 'imagine', 'problems', 'develop', 'make', 'operation', 'work', 'less', 'neatly', 'easily', 'planned', 'so', 'discerning', 'what', 'level', 'dreaming', 'what', 'level', 'reality', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'also', 'becomes', 'blurred', 'exposition', 'details', 'are', 'laid', 'more', 'concretely', 'Lynch', 'worlds', 'caveats', 'others', 'have', 'placed', 'paying', 'attention', 'are', 'well', 'mood', 'mind-benders', 'Lynch', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'Nolan', 'borrowed', 'alchemized', 'elements', 'inventive', 'movies', 'truly', 'excellent', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'adventure', 'Paprika', 'movies', ""'The"", 'Cell', 'results', 'are', 'truly', 'new', 'effective.I', 'have', 'admit', 'biases', 'love', 'mind-benders', 'accident', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'David', 'Lynch', 'are', 'top', 'list', 'favorite', 'directors', 'problem', 'love', 'mind-benders', 'rule', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'separate', 'effective', 'works', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'well.I', 'was', 'originally', 'wavering', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'film', 'based', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'give', 'details', ""'ve"", 'decided', ""'Inland"", 'Empire', 'Inception', 'may', 'seem', 'abrupt', 'import', 'surrealistic', 'experience', 'nearly', 'mind-altering', ""'Inception"", 'deserves', 'attention', 'awards', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'time', 'needed', 'truly', 'rewarding', 'film', 'experience', 'love', 'Lynch', 'work', 'will', 'probably', 'also', 'love', ""'Inception"", 'one', 'could', 'concede', 'movie', 'isn', 't', 'effective', 'playing', 'noodle', 'other', 'hand', 'find', 'Lynch', 'films', 'be', 'frustrating', 'too', 'abstract', 'then', 'Nolan', ""'Inception"", 'may', 'give', 'more', 'satisfying', 'sense', 'concreteness', 'closure', 'overall', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'join', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'taut', 'movie', 'experience', 'loose', 'ends', 'Inception', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'information', 'imdb']",N/A

1304818,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B002ZG980U,A. Estes,"[3, 5]","Ever since he spun the ""Batman"" franchise on its head half a decade ago, there's been an increasingly significant level of quality expected from writer/director Christopher Nolan. If his latest creation is any indication, Nolan sure knows how to execute a brilliant idea even when under the most intense of pressure. His latest affair, the mind-bending ""Inception,"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief who extracts thoughts and ideas from people by entering their dreams. When a job goes wrong, he is offered a chance at redemption. This time he has to introduce an idea into the mind of a subject rather than steal it away. It's an easy enough task, right? Wrong. As he soon finds out, plunging into the depths of uncharted waters is especially tricky when carrying your own personal baggage. To quote Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Total Recall"": ""It's the best mind**** yet!""""Inception"" boasts an impressive cast. DiCaprio aside, we are treated to some of the finest young talent Hollywood has to offer by way of Ellen Page, Cilian Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The actors - while excellent in their roles - are but a pawn in Nolan's game. Fact of the matter is he could have cast a group of no-names and the film would still be as great as it is. The true star of the film is not only the insanely well-crafted script which will have you second-guessing yourself at every turn, but the stunning visuals that accompany it. Watching this movie is like stepping into an alternate universe where anything you could imagine is possible. Nolan asks us to suspend disbelief as we follow the film's characters through layers of dreams. Because the script is water-tight and the visuals so flawless, we are fooled easily enough. Like children, we believe whole-heartedly in what we see unfold before us even if we aren't quite sure of how it all works.While Nolan has had a pretty consistent track-record thus far, it still comes as a shock that ""Inception"" is as good as it is. The term is thrown around loosely all too often, but the film is a heavy contender for best film of the year. More than that, though, this is Nolan's masterpiece. The director's perfectionist streak shows through in a film that truly has no flaws. It may take a few viewings to completely wrap your head around, but there is not an inch of celluloid wasted. There is not a line uttered without importance and not a special effect that looks artificial.

1304820,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,B002ZG980U,a gentle sound,"[2, 8]","I can try a review.It's full of spoiling, please stop.Inception is a movie made by a guy that apparently took ten years framing his message, that has written other movies that explored consciousness or self in some manner (The Prestige for one). From what I have read in Wiki and on-line since seeing the movie he made a decision later in the creative process to fit the movie to a ""heist"" format -after considering a ""horror"" genre. Within that I found some imposition of a form onto an idea that reminded me of how we compromise to bring to form something within an ""industry"" or sell an idea-but perhaps that is unimportant to this. However it is worth noting that he had the idea and searched out the form-within an American movie set of definitions.The movie tells the story by opening with a scene key to the ending-it will rather repeat with some differences at the end, rather enigmatic, and we are rapidly pulled into something that has to be sorted in our psyche and understood. Again a form from cinema...I got this. There is a person played by Leonardo DiCaprio who ""with a team"" is capable of entering the dreams of others and taking information. He is hired or coerced or persuaded to take on planting a dream-a different construct-within a corporate person in exchange for his freedom from some charge against him. All of that is rapidly unfolded.The dream capability-of sharing and entering them- is said to come from the ""military.""It appears -these threads-within great deals of technological structures of danger, chase (so like one  dream state),threat, feats of unbelievable strength, dexterity, so on fit what we see, but generally you are pulled into the story of a guy compromising I think, and using his ""skills"" as a dream inhabitor-or someone navigating those ""realities"" that has technologically found ways to enter others dreams and interact there to suit his purposes which on the surface seem high espionage-he now in the movie has a mission that frees him to be able to join his children and be freed of some criminal charge.His children are as shadows in this movie.So on one level you watch a deal be made.I want to say a kind of pact with the devil, but my daughter has reassured me this initial set up is ""how all heist movies function."" From the ""deal."" For me early on in the movie I was watching this as a deep moral compromise that seemed to be saying, just one last ""job"" or wrong, and everything will be right.Inherently a bad thing.At that point I was uncomfortable, and doubted that anything after it would -no matter how it was acted, completed, or done, nothing seemed to flow from such a thing that would not be problematic. Rather like war to attain peace, or someone avenging, or the use of terrorism within a cause. It just seemed to me to enter into a deeply compromised situation.It's funny but at that point, early in the movie, I was aware of just such deep disappointment. Because of that I flashed a thought to the horror genre, and to thoughts I personally have about our culture and its compromises in making technology a god. For what it is worth.Anyway....I'm tempted within this to tell the storyline to you but I don't recall all the names, all the references. I did not go intending to write about it- so I am a poor source for the story-line.  It's available though pretty credibly done on Wiki. I read it coming home and it represents it pretty well.I will however comment on how I took the movie.The character DiCaprio played was evidentally trained in this art of invasion of dreams by a professor played really briefly and gauzily by Michael Caine. Sad his part is limited to almost nothing. It also appears that this is the father of his dead wife-who we will learn lives in his dreams to haunt him-and he goes to Caine to get an ""architect"" for his new dream invasion last mission having had his architect suffer some incredibly bad something we saw at movie's start....a person that can construct a dream scape so that he can pull the characters into this place-without knowing its secrets himself entirely- to be safe from his wife who functions as a negative-and then to act out his mission. He wants a girl really, a young student, to agree to design for him and in record time this person agrees. That struck me because she remains the character in the movie that is the least compromised, most caring, most intact in terms of an ethic, most idealized-and yet she enters into this deal supposedly intrigued by the fact that she can construct this multi-layered dream context rapidly and with little question.Nothing like a compromised innocent.I suppose a Madonna.She is empowered in that way and the dream world she is sold on as so creatively powerful and entrancing-so that for her merely just being in this world once is not enough. So she ""must"" do it.From then on she acts as protector to the other characters without question. Totally in.So there are scenes as he sets up his team, dangerous, unbelievable ones, and we learn what they are going to do and why.Basically get into a corporate heir's head and plant the idea he's to break up his father's empire on his death. This a Chinese businessman who has leveraged him by ""getting to"" DiCaprio, offering him the one thing he wants-to be able to be with his kids again. Movie start scene.That's why Caine ""helps"" him to gain the girl, and to enter the process of designing a three level dream world. Father of the daughter-in -law.So I really don't have it in me to narrate the entering of the three levels of dreams they design to get this ""job"" done, all the tricky film-atic stuff, all the things that go so wrong, all the symbols, all the connections, and do it justice. It's quite a tangle. But to get the idea planted the characters have quite a set of rules, levels, dangers that will thrill anyone who is deeply wedded to technological movie wonder. Or to dreams and psychology I suspect.It involves one heck of a lot of shooting.What happened for me was I started following a few themes.The character has lost his wife.She reappears in different ways to stop him, to scuttle him, to pull him further into a dream world. Eventually this gets ""explained"" as his demon, his guilt, what drives and haunts him.He isn't able to entirely free himself from this projection we are told in his mind of this wife Mal. Incredible name. She's negative, she's difficult, cruel...sexual, needy, shallow, so many things but an adversary...he remains full of guilt associated with her ""real"" death-tortured by it-she has occupied this dream world with him in ""the past"" and both undoubtedly are driven crazy from it-but she broke...Broke. So I took from this that she represents what damage comes, the warning, the siren, what can go so"" very wrong"" from dreams/reality issues.From fooling in this stuff.When your dreams and your reality come up against the limits of the mind perhaps. Or against man as god. She went crazy from an idea he implanted in her, we learn, to bring her back to reality from the dream world. And he's left with his image/projection of her in his mind-that appears in the shared dreaming- from her real suicide caused as she endeavored to take them both through death back to this dream world.Neat huh?Oh well....I still struggle to sort whose dream we are in, whose dream was escaped from, how an open end could be interpreted and I couldn't really present all of it here...and I'm sorry for that.As I watched about 3/4th's through in scenes with archetypal protectors attempting to kill the protagonists in the first of three dreams within dreams (each with very different time space perceptions) I thought of my mother. Yes, my very frail aging mother. For reasons I won't go into at length.It was very strange because it was too real.It was very strange, unconnected, but it took over my concentration for a bit.I had the realist sense of my being unable to face her death, being too weak for that, unwilling to do that-how it would be crushing to my psyche, too final, too sad, just it was a very deep feeling. I guess it was grief, regret, but I was sorry for me in that-I said almost aloud-""I'm too weak for this."" Right in the most intensely inappropriate final solution scenes.I sat with that- somewhat like several nights before I sat thinking of the finality of death-mine/my kids, just sat...and only slowly re-entered the logics of the movie.I looked at this movie as a discussion of realities, of what is real.I've studied this through religions, physics, through reading for 40 years...and I'm not sure that I feel that gets enhanced in a heist movie, or against a western backdrop of shooting, archetypes, stereotypes,technological gimmicks....maybe. I'm not sure that you really get to these issues within that context exactly...so for me it pushed in that direction but under constraints and limitations of genre, money, movies...the duress of enduring the genre.The movie poses that we can plant ideas within another's dreams that become real and driving for them. AND This loops me to my mother. Interestingly.It's a movie. It explores notions like this amazing technological thing we are creating, it is looking at the functions of the psyche set within a landscape consistent with American cutting edge movie making-it has gravity free fight scenes and the elements advanced gamers will love-its got the language and feel of this futuristic world ...but somehow I related back into some pretty deep struggling I've had over the years with ideas around someone entering our psyche- profoundly altering and destroying  our safety/security fears.The invasion aspect disturbs me still.I came out of the theater having a lot of that pushing around in my head as well as I tried to hold onto my realities.I'm a dreamer. I often retreat into dreams. One of the things I do know about myself is I often prefer the world asleep.I say this because I thought about it after the movie.Thought about dreams and their function. Thought about ""what is real"" -thought about illusions.The movie for me was a vehicle for that kind of traveling.But my reactions are so personal I guess I can't step away to really write a decent ""review"" because I'm not sure anyone else would be that interested.Sorry...this is a sure let down as a review but a fascinating movie.

1304821,A3VSXJ959S2HY0,B002ZG980U,Agent Smith,"[3, 14]","I can not say it is boring, but I had a hard time to finish watching it. Lots of meaningless actions, gun fights packed to the eyeballs, ""mind bending"" talking about what nobody including actors understands. Comparison to ""Matrix"" or ""Memento"" is just laughable.  Plot is ridiculously complicated in a bad way and poorly executed.Center piece dream design is underdeveloped. Heck, it's not even tried! It feels like any freshman from ""Mind Bending Academy"" is genius enough to do the job somehow. Yeah, there is a silver case with a big button and some sort of tubes to connect to the dreams, yet dream is full of other peoples, which is explained via sub conscience.For some strange reasons beyond me sub conscience is a bitch: always aggressive and ultra violent, military trained and is using firepower without hesitations. No guns? Fear not, it can still tear you apart with bare hands, just like dead men in ""Resident evil"" or hivers in ""I am a Legend"". Which is good - if you are dead, you awake.The whole idea to plant the idea is secondary. First things first, ACTION! It's non-stop, it's 24/7 without any reason and regrets. Who cares why? As long as it blasts, shoots, burns, cuts, hits, kills, tears, drives, drowns, climbs, flies - it's goodStupendous action reaches its peak in the best Bond-like tradition when heroes are storming fortress in the remote snow covered mountain region. So they ski, they shoot, they climb, etc. Throw in Aston Martin, shaken martini and famous ""my name is Bond, James Bond"" and it could be easily disguised.There is no logic anywhere. Events are disconnected. Ex-wife factor is overdone and happy end with kids is unexplainable: why would they jump to unknown alien who says he is the father? Yet there he is with eyes and tears. This movie may work for someone who likes shooting, but why so many emotions then?Movie has a couple of fresh ideas, like recursive dreaming, 12x time stretching factor when you re-enter (although 12x is obviously not enough, it should have been 100-1000 times judging by the length of the movie and time needed for the van to reach the water in the free fall from the bridge). So I stretched too and gave 2 stars, but overall I do not agree with positive reviews here and almost regret my promotional $5 spent towards renting this movie.The good thing I did not spend real money on it.

1304824,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B002ZG980U,AIROLF,"[2, 3]","Inception  is an intricate film: in its storyline, its sets and its special effects. The film is a psychological heist drama that questions the boundaries of dreams and reality and incorporates all that is generally known and perceived to be occurring in the dream state. This film contains plenty of shoot-them-up and blow-them-up scenes to rival the average blockbuster, but Inception stands out due to a fine script, more than capable cast, and the mind-boggling questions it raises.The film has a traditionally Christopher Nolan feel to it, particularly the very last scene that leaves the viewer to provide the ending that he or she feels inclined. I watched the 6:00 p.m. Monday showing of the film and the AMC theater was quite crowded. At the end of the movie, every single viewer groaned. But the expression was a response to the realization that the film's director wasn't about to provide all the answers.The reason Christopher Nolan's movies -Memento,The Prestige,The Dark Knight (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray], etc. - are fascinating is because Nolan is able to get his audience to invest in his characters and to believe the world he has created, but Nolan never manipulates his viewers or gives the Hollywood version of the happy endings that blockbusters are expected to have these days.Nolan is intrinsically original in his storylines and in his portrayal of those storylines and Inception is no different.I've heard the promotion for this movie asThe Matrixmeets Mememto. Such a comparison would not do Inception justice. To compare this movie toDark City (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray] would be to limit the range that Inception undertakes. Simply put, Nolan's latest film is based on the sci-fi films that precede it but it's original in its scope and execution.As one would expect with a Nolan film, the cast is an ensemble of some of the best actors, each of whom is able to share the screen without a grudge and to hold his or her own. Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic in his portrayal of a thief who can penetrate the subconsciousness and extract and embed information at will. Both Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are the creme of the crop of those rarest Young Hollywood actors who are not only good-looking and youthful but are also talented. Cillian Murphy displays his naivete and boyish charm, whereas Marion Cotillard is rightfully convincing as the woman who insists of luring DiCaprio's character to spend eternity with her. And last but not least, Michael Caine proves once again that he is able to portray an old sage quite wisely.It goes without saying, but the special effects and stunts are simply stunning. The art direction of this film deserves the highest accolades and it's quite obvious that without convincing effects this film wouldn't be believable at all.In writing a review for the film, I came to the realization that I'm truly unable to the express how unique experience of watching this movie is. AWESOME is the only word that truly describes it, as in awe-aspiring fascination with the art of filmmaking and the way a filmmaker can stir up emotions and intellectual understanding in his viewers. This is the kind of film that needs multiple viewings to allow the viewers true immersion into the storyline and true understanding of the plot.",5,Begin something AWESOME,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,3283,"['Inception', 'intricate', 'film', 'storyline', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'psychological', 'heist', 'drama', 'questions', 'boundaries', 'dreams', 'reality', 'generally', 'known', 'perceived', 'be', 'occurring', 'dream', 'state', 'film', 'plenty', 'shoot-them-up', 'blow-them-up', 'scenes', 'rival', 'average', 'blockbuster', 'Inception', 'out', 'due', 'fine', 'script', 'more', 'capable', 'cast', 'mind-boggling', 'questions', 'film', 'traditionally', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'feel', 'particularly', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'viewer', 'provide', 'ending', 'feels', 'inclined', 'watched', '6:00', 'p.m.', 'Monday', 'showing', 'film', 'AMC', 'theater', 'was', 'quite', 'crowded', 'end', 'movie', 'single', 'viewer', 'groaned', 'expression', 'was', 'response', 'realization', 'film', 'director', 'was', ""n't"", 'about', 'provide', 'answers.The', 'reason', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'movies', '-Memento', 'Prestige', 'Dark', 'Knight', '+', 'BD', 'Live', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'etc', 'are', 'fascinating', 'Nolan', 'able', 'get', 'audience', 'invest', 'characters', 'believe', 'world', 'created', 'Nolan', 'never', 'viewers', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'happy', 'endings', 'blockbusters', 'are', 'expected', 'have', 'days.Nolan', 'intrinsically', 'original', 'storylines', 'portrayal', 'storylines', 'Inception', 'different.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'promotion', 'movie', 'Matrixmeets', 'Mememto', 'comparison', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'Inception', 'justice', 'compare', 'movie', 'toDark', 'City', 'Director', 'Cut', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'would', 'be', 'limit', 'range', 'Inception', 'undertakes', 'Simply', 'put', 'Nolan', 'latest', 'film', 'based', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'precede', 'original', 'scope', 'execution.As', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Nolan', 'film', 'cast', 'ensemble', 'best', 'actors', 'whom', 'able', 'share', 'screen', 'grudge', 'hold', 'own', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'fantastic', 'portrayal', 'thief', 'who', 'can', 'penetrate', 'subconsciousness', 'extract', 'embed', 'information', 'will', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'are', 'creme', 'crop', 'rarest', 'Young', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'good-looking', 'youthful', 'are', 'also', 'talented', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'naivete', 'boyish', 'charm', 'whereas', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'rightfully', 'convincing', 'woman', 'who', 'luring', 'DiCaprio', 'character', 'spend', 'eternity', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'once', 'again', 'able', 'portray', 'old', 'sage', 'quite', 'wisely.It', 'saying', 'special', 'effects', 'stunts', 'are', 'simply', 'stunning', 'art', 'direction', 'film', 'highest', 'accolades', 'quite', 'obvious', 'convincing', 'effects', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'believable', 'all.In', 'writing', 'review', 'film', 'came', 'realization', ""'m"", 'truly', 'unable', 'express', 'how', 'unique', 'experience', 'watching', 'movie', 'AWESOME', 'only', 'word', 'truly', 'awe-aspiring', 'fascination', 'art', 'filmmaking', 'way', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'stir', 'up', 'emotions', 'intellectual', 'understanding', 'viewers', 'kind', 'film', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'allow', 'viewers', 'true', 'immersion', 'storyline', 'true', 'understanding', 'plot']",N/A

I never expected the 10 hour mission to be longer than 30 minutes, let alone much of the movie. In fact, my brain will never be the same again. Just like the pretty Ellen Page said: ""It's pure creation.""In this movie, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a thief. In fact, a dream thief. He knows the tricks to navigate one's mind. To perform a heist, he prepares an awesome team. He is the EXTRACTOR. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the POINT MAN. Ellen Page plays the ARCHITECT. Ken Watanabe is the TOURIST. Marion Cotillard is the SHADE. Cillian Murphy is the MARK. Tom Hardy does a James Bond when playing the FORGER, and Micheal Caine is there for a bit. :)Now that you know the actors, how did they perform. My goodness, they are first-rate. Best ensemble of the year. Leo is simply awesome. The whole movie rests on his shoulders. Joseph is great; he plays a likable guy and is badass in one of the most amazing fights I've seen. Page and Cotillard look great and act really well. Caine is there for a bit and does a great job. Ken i s great, Murphy is solid and Berenger is good.Like BLADE RUNNER, this movie shows us completely new ideas and never bores. The talky parts are vital to the story. In fact, just like BR, people will question where the story lies. There is a story in all that visual glamor, and a beautiful one. I knew what to expect of it and got a huge surprise. The story is powerful and touching.Now to the technical parts. The visuals are beautiful and used well. Not over-the-top at all; realistic as hell. The action sequences are hard-boiled and fast paced. Unlike other movies, you can't count how many there are. It's just so many put together. Since I'm an action-movie fan, the fact that there were so many in one sequence made me cry with happiness. Well, it almost did.There will also be people that will say it is original, but in years, we'll get better movies that use their ideas to full potential. I say:this movie is way ahead of our time, just like BLADE RUNNER was in 1982. To wrap it all up, INCEPTION is BRILLIANT. Christopher Nolan never disappoints. Through his career he has given us a masterpiece after masterpiece. His fans know his true masterpiece will be the one with the intelligent script of MEMENTO and the scale of DARK KNIGHT.

Christopher Nolan has had his up and downs as a director but he sure hit home with this movie and I would not be surprised to see this movie win a couple of Oscars. The one thing about this movie is you are going to have to see it more than one time to get it. Even if you follow this movie closely without taking a break or getting distracted you still might miss something. That's how much detail is involved in this movie. I tell you Leonardo Dicaprio has another hit movie as well. I thought him in Shutter Island was amazing but this even topped that. I thought the idea of this movie had so many twists when you thought you had the movie figured out. For example there are times in this movie they are dreaming and wake up but in reality they are still dreaming and it's not easy to figure out. The mazes were designed so well in this movie as well. Near the end of the movie there are three or more different scenes going on because they are all dreaming at the time. The part that you're going to have to follow is the dead wife of Leonardo Dicaprio in this movie because she shows up so many times and is involved in so many angles. The problem is that he can't let her go even though she is dead because how much she loved him and that will play a crucial part in the movie later on. I feel the whole movie is good but the last 45 minutes of this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. I will not spoil the ending for you but let's just say there are so many questions left to be answered after you see this ending. This movie was a huge hit. I saw it when it came out in theaters the first day and my parents got the DVD for me for Christmas.

1304834,AVAHA06K08ZKK,B002ZG980U,Alwyn Lau,"[4, 5]","This movie would be best loved by analytically inclined folks who love to `figure out' movies and talk through exactly what (and why) happened. The conversations generated alone would ensure the movie will stick with its audiences for some time and this criteria - that of `stickiness' long after the movie is over - is what makes a good film very good, if not great. Hence, the 4 stars.Undoubtedly, the dream-worlds the movie brought to the public imagination have been the main focus of discussion. What I'd like to focus on here is how the movie reflects our world itself, starting with a question almost crucial to the entire movie: Why does DiCaprio's totem keep falling in the movie? And how do we understand this in the light of the ending where it (almost) fell but didn't?I hope the following sheds light not only on our understanding of ourselves and the world we live in but also on the movie itself. So again, why does DiCaprio's totem keep falling in the movie?Layer #1 (Objectivity)...Because whenever it falls that's the Really Real World he's living in (and in which it keeps falling). As he explained to his female apprentice, the totem is the only thing which can confirm if he's dreaming or not i.e. in the end DiCaprio was NOT in a dream (Nolan was merely being playful by closing off the scene at approximately the moment when the totem would fall) - this seems the most likely (and least problematic) position.On this view, the totem served as a mark / leftover / reminder of Objective and True reality. We still know that we know something and so we need to hold on.Layer #2 (Construction)...Because, given the fact that we create our dreams (whilst simultaneously experiencing them), the totem falling was DiCaprio's own doing within his dream. Then again, it could've been a result of his continual (self?)-tormenting due to having spent half a century with his wife in a dream only to awake and have his wife kill herself. But after the final 'therapy session' when he 'dealt with' his (quasi-/un-) dead wife, his dreams then reflected his much improved condition. Summing it up: Subconscious/Wife haunting him = Totem keeps falling. Subconscious/Wife exorcised = Totem spins on and on (as when he meets with Watanabe at the start / after many decades in limbo) - the dreams we have both determine yet depend on the state of our hearts.On this view, the very symbol of Reality is our own construction and there's simply no way of knowing if we're dreaming or not. The movie provokes us to re-examine what we consider real or not, how we often lose touch with the actual for the virtual, how the virtual 'plants itself' into our lives and the consequences we face as a result. We now know that we do not know something and so we need to keep searching.Layer #3 (Chaos)...Because the totem, signifying our dreams, have 'taken over' us and has not only blurred our grasp of reality and  dreams but has subverted our very ability to ever find out. Humanity is thus locked in with an intrinsic-yet-external(!!) - a sub-trinsic? - element both inseparable from, yet in full control of, us i.e. our dreams. At least in the previous view, the problem was merely internal in that our ability to decipher reality from dreams has malfunctioned. On this third view, though, our sub-conscious (the deep 'Reality' in our very core) is a malignant force which takes hold of us.On this perspective, the entire movie was, of course, merely a dream but whose? Who's the dream-agent? Whose were the projections? Instead of us spinning the totem, it was really the totem spinning us. This view fits well with the unpredictability and out-of-control-ness which permeated the movie. In Biblical terms, the dream was like the sea with all its terror and splendor, engulfing Man with deadly (and largely unknowable) force.The Dream, then, is More Real than Reality itself and we can never stand far back enough. Inception, here, depicts realms beyond our control. We do not know what exactly it is we do not know, and so we need to adapt and fight a way forward in the unknown.Layer #4 (Obsession)...Most controversially, the answer to the question could be: Because our dreams have taken over us yet this is exactly what we want(!!). Recall DiCaprio's quixotic struggle with his dead-yet-alive wife, how he both truly wants to 'go home' yet at the same time can never get enough of the dreamworld. How, as master architect of the dream landscape, he alone FULLY knows the 'rules' and principles of the dreamworld yet remains 'possessed' somehow by his very own dreams in such a way that he continually (yet willingly and obsessively!) breaks the very boundaries he sets for others.The movie, on this view, brings us to face to face with a 'cut' in our universe, the site of which is our sub-conscious which - far from being 'hidden' - does in fact manifest itself in powerful ways i.e. it is the heart of our hearts about which we know not, yet from which can be loosed the most intense and terrible of desires. It's us in our most central yet also most inaccessible. It's that which drives us on yet which our rational minds reject; its desire in its purest because what it desires is to keep on desiring. This is what the totem represents: A never-ending fixation which in whatever position, whether spinning or stationary, looks exactly the same.Our dreams control and create us all, yet they are of our own planting. We are our own demons and angels, unwillingly yet lustfully embracing our self-created destructive and paradisiacal fates.Inception is not about giving answers (having one's desires fulfilled) nor is it about proposing new questions (having new desires) - it's really about the never-ending act of asking (desiring as an end in itself). Over and over again. At the deepest level of our lives, we do not know what we know and this is precisely what we yearn to keep on (not) knowing.",4,"DiCaprio's Totem : Objectivity, Construction, Chaos or

1304835,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B002ZG980U,Amanda,"[3, 4]","I have to start this review by saving if you haven't seen Inception yet -go see it. Seriously, if you haven't seen the movie stop reading this review now, get your butt down to the local theater and see this movie. I'll wait....Okay, seen Inception? Yeah, it's pretty freaking awesome. It's hard to say much beyond ""genius,"" but I'll try. Honestly, Inception is one of the most intelligent movies I've ever seen that still manages to be thrilling, surprising and downright amazing. Most importantly, in an industry flooded with sequels, remakes, reboots and movies based on already-existing properties, Inception is actually original (shock). I know the advertising campaign tried to play it off as a mix between James Bond and The Matrix, which it kind of is (by a stretch), but Inception feels more like a high-budget indie film than anything else.In the world of Inception, the technology exists for individuals to break into others' dreams, create environments so they can ""extract"" certain information, typically an idea. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is one of the best Extractors in the business, but after an extraction fails, he and his team are on the run from the powerful entities that hired them. However, an unexpected person offers Cobb a free ticket back home -and back to his children -if he can invade a certain person's mind and, rather than extracting a idea, plant one so deep and convincing that the person believes they thought of it themselves.Inception is as epic as the plot seems. From the beginning writer/director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) throws viewers into an unforgettable and fascinating world where dreams and reality blur. Though the viewer is left clueless for the first 15 minutes or so, the introduction of Architect Ariadne (Ellen Page) offers a much-needed exposition dump and moves the plot into the complex web of a throughly thought-out, intelligent and fairly scientific examination of the human psyche and the shades that torment it.The special effects are pretty awesome too -somewhat reminiscent of The Matrix, but so strange yet familiar that they felt just like dreams should. One thing about the special effects that I really liked is the fact that there was very little CG, a Chris Nolan signature. Rather than being assaulted by very fake-looking CG, everything, especially the weightless scenes where characters are floating through the air, look real.Dare I say there are flaws? Well, maybe a few that some of the dissenters out there cling to -but that's being super picky. For me those flaws are length of the film and the lack of back story for any of the supporting characters. While I admit the length isn't too bad (a swift two and a half hours) I did kind of wish that I could pause the movie and take a few minutes to stretch a bit and well, let me my digest some of the epic awesome that was unfolding on screen. But as for the lack of back story for the characters aside from Cobb -yeah, that's a bigger deal. Since so much time is dedicated to what's going on in Cobb's mind that the other characters were thrown to the wayside somewhat -but I admit, I didn't even notice this until after the movie was over. While, of course, there will always be someone out there who dislikes certain movies, etc., I find it hard to believe that people could downright hate it.Easily one of the top films of the summer, possibly of the year or even the decade, Inception is an amazing piece of original cinema that should set a new standard for innovation in Hollywood.",5,Finally -something original!,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,3530,"['have', 'start', 'review', 'saving', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Inception', 'yet', '-go', 'see', 'Seriously', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'stop', 'reading', 'review', 'now', 'get', 'butt', 'down', 'local', 'theater', 'see', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'wait', '.Okay', 'seen', 'Inception', 'Yeah', 'pretty', 'freaking', 'awesome', 'hard', 'say', 'much', 'genius', ""'ll"", 'try', 'Honestly', 'Inception', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'still', 'be', 'thrilling', 'surprising', 'downright', 'amazing', 'Most', 'importantly', 'industry', 'flooded', 'sequels', 'remakes', 'reboots', 'movies', 'based', 'already-existing', 'properties', 'Inception', 'actually', 'original', 'shock', 'know', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'tried', 'play', 'off', 'mix', 'James', 'Bond', 'Matrix', 'kind', 'stretch', 'Inception', 'more', 'high-budget', 'indie', 'film', 'anything', 'world', 'Inception', 'technology', 'individuals', 'break', 'others', 'dreams', 'create', 'environments', 'can', 'extract', 'certain', 'information', 'typically', 'idea', 'Dom', 'Cobb', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'one', 'best', 'Extractors', 'business', 'extraction', 'team', 'are', 'run', 'powerful', 'entities', 'hired', 'However', 'unexpected', 'person', 'offers', 'Cobb', 'free', 'ticket', 'back', 'home', '-and', 'back', 'children', 'can', 'invade', 'certain', 'person', 'mind', 'rather', 'extracting', 'idea', 'plant', 'one', 'so', 'deep', 'convincing', 'person', 'thought', 'themselves.Inception', 'as', 'epic', 'plot', 'beginning', 'writer/director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'viewers', 'unforgettable', 'fascinating', 'world', 'where', 'dreams', 'reality', 'blur', 'viewer', 'left', 'clueless', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'introduction', 'Architect', 'Ariadne', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'much-needed', 'exposition', 'dump', 'plot', 'complex', 'web', 'throughly', 'thought-out', 'intelligent', 'fairly', 'scientific', 'examination', 'human', 'psyche', 'shades', 'torment', 'it.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'too', '-somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Matrix', 'so', 'strange', 'yet', 'familiar', 'felt', 'just', 'dreams', 'should', 'One', 'thing', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'liked', 'fact', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'CG', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'signature', 'Rather', 'being', 'assaulted', 'very', 'fake-looking', 'CG', 'everything', 'especially', 'weightless', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'floating', 'air', 'look', 'real.Dare', 'say', 'are', 'flaws', 'Well', 'maybe', 'few', 'dissenters', 'out', 'there', 'cling', '-but', 'being', 'super', 'picky', 'flaws', 'are', 'length', 'film', 'lack', 'back', 'story', 'supporting', 'characters', 'admit', 'length', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'swift', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'did', 'kind', 'wish', 'could', 'pause', 'movie', 'take', 'few', 'minutes', 'stretch', 'bit', 'well', 'let', 'digest', 'epic', 'awesome', 'was', 'unfolding', 'screen', 'lack', 'back', 'story', 'characters', 'aside', 'Cobb', '-yeah', 'bigger', 'deal', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'dedicated', 'what', 'going', 'Cobb', 'mind', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'thrown', 'wayside', 'somewhat', '-but', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'course', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'certain', 'movies', 'etc.', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'people', 'could', 'downright', 'hate', 'it.Easily', 'one', 'top', 'films', 'summer', 'possibly', 'year', 'even', 'decade', 'Inception', 'amazing', 'piece', 'original', 'cinema', 'should', 'set', 'new', 'standard', 'innovation', 'Hollywood']",N/A

Now, I know there are at least another five months left in the year, but I've viewed the upcoming releases and, besides Ben Affleck'sThe Town (Extended Cut Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)and/or David Fincher's ""The Social Network"" having the only chance of disproving my statement, trust me, there aren't any more contenders. So I'm safe in calling this right now. With its movie trailers that recall shades ofThe MatrixandDark City (Director's Cut), ""Inception"" is brought to us by one of the best filmmakers today, Christopher Nolan (the man behind the successful - finally! - reboot of the Batman franchise). And while ""Inception"" does have a mind-altering plot like ""The Matrix"" and ""Dark City,"" that's where the similarities end. The only description I will give besides stating that it's a cool heist noir film that balances drama, action and science fiction with one master stroke, is that the film revolves around a group of dream extractors lead by Dominic ""Dom"" Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who rather than extract information from a target's mind, are hired to implant an idea in a new corporate leader's (Cillian Murphy) head, hence the title ""Inception.""Besides DiCaprio and Murphy, the rest of the cast are also spectacular: Joseph Gordon-Levitt (one of my favorite actors), Marion Cotillard, Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Tom Berenger, Dileep Rao, and brief appearances by Michael Caine, Lukas Haas, and Pete Postlethwaite. Nolan has always been blessed with great actors in all of his films (Memento (Widescreen Two-Disc Limited Edition),Insomnia,The Prestige, and the aforementioned Batman movies), so it's really no surprise that he gets the best performances. It also helps that Nolan is one of the best contemporary screenwriters and it is evidenced in all of his works. I heard that he is shepherding the next Superman film and, after first reading up on it, I was a little nervous because I've heard reports of him and screenwriter David Goyer handling it like it's never been done before. However, after viewing Inception, I am completely comfortable with his handling a character for which I have such a strong affection.It's surprising to hear that for many of the film's spellbinding (and mindbending) sequences, rather than using CGI, Nolan insisted on placing the actors on actual rotating sets, making the action look real. And I'm grateful he did; it shows in the film's overall production value. In a day when films are bogged down with CGI and little - or recycled - plot (ahem, ""Avatar""), it's something really special when a film not only makes you think on an intellectual level, but also delivers a fresh story with emotional depth. As I said in my review forToy Story 3 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy), James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is visually and technically stunning but its story is extremely predictable just from watching the trailer, it's uninspiring and trite (the story being a recycled product of several films, most notably Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, and even Cameron's own earlier, better release The Abyss, which focused more on emotion rather than special effects). And that's where most films are headed nowadays. That's why when films like Inception come along, it's important to embrace them ... especially when it's well written and well acted such as this. I know the technical aspects of a film are important as well, but, above all, CGI and special effects should never take precedence or drown out a film's story. Fortunately, Inception perfectly balances the mindblowing special effects and story.Yes, there are plenty of special effects in this film, but the real standout aspect to this film is its story - it's original and captivating with a plot that keeps you biting your nails right until the end. I've heard some reviews and reactions from people saying that this film is confusing and difficult to follow; I couldn't disagree more. The film is involved and you do need to actually think and pay attention to the story, but if you do, there is no confusion. My only advice would be that if you have to use the restroom during this two-and-a-half hour masterpiece, make sure you're either with someone or sitting near someone who can explain to you what you missed because you'll need to know. There are more than two different realities in this film so you'll definitely need to pay attention; this isn't some film you go to with friends and talk to during the entire film and yet still can follow what's happening.Nolan's original work proves that he should be doing more original projects (aside from his debut, ""Following,"" all of his films have either been a remake of a film or based on a novel or comic), and I can only hope that there are more in store in the near future. As I stated earlier, the action is paced very well without overloading the senses and it keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through the journey with DiCaprio and company until the end. The concept of time in a dream state as well as other aspects of dreaming are intriguingly explored without dumbing down dialogue and explanations to insult the audience's intelligence, but, at the same time, is not so much complex that you need an encyclopedia to view the film.""Inception"" provides lush visuals, a uniquely stylish story and a range of emotions that should make every great film. After viewing this film, a friend wrote me, telling me to drop anything I was doing and go see ""Inception"" because there was nothing more important. Well, that's a bit extreme (no offense to him!). However, ""Inception"" is a must-see and if anyone were to ask me, I'd say without hesitation that it's the best film of 2010.",5,Best Movie of the Year!,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,5853,"['know',

I thought the movie was very good and had excellent acting, music, locations, action and performances. Chris Nolan has served us another mid bender after Memento. I came across an article which said that Inception can be attributed to Quantum Physics which points out that the real world does not actually exist and solids are nothing but an illusion created by energy. I read many articles which have attempted to decipher the movie and the following is a compilation of the best answers to the riddle called Inception. I strongly caution that you do not read the following if you have not seen the movie. These are not my theories but compiled from various blogs and newspapers.Explanation 1 The spinning top is central to the film. Cobb explains that one can distinguish dreams from reality on the basis of the totems motion. If it stops you are in the real world and vice versa.Explanation 2 Cobb's ring appears in dream sequences and disappears when he is in reality. In the last scene the top is still spinning but there is no ring on his finger. His children have not aged and look the same. Was Inception a dream or a reality?Explanation 3 Cobb was just dreaming on the flight from Sydney to Los Angeles.Explantion 4 Adriane ( Ellen Paige) not Cobb was the head shrink who had been hired by Cobb's father played by Michael Caine to cure his son of his guilt complex. According to this theory Cobb was in a mental facility and his room number was 528491- the number that Fisher gives as the password to his father's safe. Adriane plants the Inception in Cobbs head to make him realize that his wife is dead and that he should move on.Some other Theories:Did Cobb and Mal ( Marillion Cotillard) go old together? They did and Cobbs memory of their youth is a fantasy. Why? Because when Cobb tells Adriane the final story of how they escaped the limbo, the clasped hands of Mal and Cobb on the railroad tracks appear old and wrinkled, just as they are when we see them walking towards the city. The youthful version could be a delusion created by Cobb which was visited by Adriane.Too many questions, Inception deserves multiple viewings to be understood.

He's hired to do a job called ""Inception"", implanting an idea in their minds (for a certain outcome) rather than just stealing secrets, to do this job he gets some other helpers who each play an important role in the operation. When they enter the target's mind things don't go as planned and they have to figure out how to get out before they go into limbo.The plot is pretty deep and there's many facets to it so I think you should see it rather than me trying to explain it all in full detail.Considering what I heard from other people, I had high expectations. I also just also watched another ""Award Winning Movie"" and was not impressed. This movie basically lived up to the expectations. It made you think, had concepts you don't usually see in movies and had good acting. I wish there were more movies like this instead of watching the same old thing over and over.I really don't care for extremely confusing movies but it was confusing in a good way. Some argue the concepts been done before but it hasnt been done before in this way or this well.Is it the best movie in the world? Id say it's not the best but in the top 5. If it has things i've never seen before in a movie and a good story then yea i'd say its near the best ever.People try to compare this to other movies from the past that shared a similar concept- but you can't.

1304848,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG980U,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Yes, I said masterpiece.This is going to be difficult, since saying too much here is surely damaging to the movie going experience.  This film has been criticized as much as it has been praised, and all for the same thing, the depth of the script.  Yes, this film can be hard to grasp IF you aren't paying attention, but it really isn't too complicated to follow if you walk in with the right mindset.  My brother hated this film, but he went with a bunch of reckless teenagers who talked throughout the whole movie.  This isn't your typical action film; you have to actually `watch' this one.  I went with my wife.We LOVED it.Simply put, `Inception' is about a man named Cobb who, due to his profession, has been separated from the ones he loves.  His wife is dead and he has been charged with her murder.  If he returns to the states, he will be incarcerated.  So, for the time being, he is not able to see his children.  What it is that Cobb does is someone complicated.  He uses dreams to steal valuable ideas from influential people.  Using technology suited for this task, he enters the mind of the sleeping, builds dreamscapes inside their minds and creates an alternate reality that allows him to extract whatever it is he is paid to find.It's not as hard to follow as it sounds.At the films outset we are shown just how this works.  After a botched job, Cobb and his partner Arthur are given a proposition; to perform inception.  With this job would come the ability to return home and see his children.  There is a small problem though.  Inception is much different and much more complicated a procedure because it involves implanting an idea, not stealing one.  This is harder because it is a much deeper deception; for in order for the idea to take root and grow, Cobb and his team have to make it feel as though the `victim' has come up with this idea all on his own.It has to feel real.Christopher Nolan has a huge following, especially after his brilliant `The Dark Knight', which garnered lots of praise, attention and even an Oscar or two.  While that film continues to grow on me in ways unprecedented (not really, but you get the picture...it is brilliant), there is no denying that Nolan continues to show the goods.  `Inception' is so smart it's scary.  Nolan understands that society in general gravitates towards the action film.  It is the big Hollywood summer blockbuster.  It is a way to make a lot of money.  BUT, Nolan also understands that big explosions and million-dollar effects cannot take the place of a smart and involved script.  He has continued to build a name for himself by marrying the two components beautifully, and `Inception' is no exception.  The film is complex yet free-flowing.  The pacing is exceptional.  The dramatic overtones are all there in spades, especially since the main characters are fleshed out and given life (Cobb becomes three dimensional, and his back-story is just as entrancing as the films actual plot without ever taking away from it).  Some have mentioned that the acting is standard fare, and then some have raved Leonardo DiCaprio and claimed this the best performance of his career.  I don't agree with either statement (best of his career...really?) but I came very close to writing this review as a `best in show' piece and somewhat Oscar FYC for Marion Cotillard, who is just plain OUTSTANDING in this film.Anyways, I decided not to (but a surprise Oscar nomination for her would be AMAZING and totally deserved).That said, this film is very, very good.  I fully expect it to snag a slew of Oscar nominations (including Best Picture and Best Director) and it will be deserved.

Star Wars introduced nerds around the world to the idea of the force. The Matrix introduced us to the idea that our world might be a giant simulation. And Inception introduced a whole bunch of horribly modified versions of the noun &#34;inception&#34;, all used to describe some version of controlling a dream or having one or more dreams within a dream. After this movie was released, I can't count the Facebook status updates stating how people &#34;incepted&#34; or &#34;inceptioned&#34; or &#34;incept&#34; various dream states. And every time I experience a dream within a dream, perhaps for the rest of my life, I will remember this movie.As a movie, Inception is incredible.

As a whole, I have been unimpressed with movies lately, and I saw this as almost a last-gasp effort to be truly impressed with cinema again.  Then, Inception came along.As a film major in college, this was the type of movie that we all wanted (and still want) to achieve someday - a truly fascinating movie that is as much a feast for the eyes as much as it is a puzzle for the mind.  The story revolves around Cobb (excellently articulated by Leonardo DiCaprio), and his team of unusual characters who make a living by extracting the secrets of high-powered people, which they they are usually tasked to do by a competitor.  Until now, they have focused primarily on extracting secrets.  But then, a client has a tall order - can they actually plant an idea into another's mind?  The story unfolds brilliantly from then on, twisting and turning and throwing in loopholes left and right, forcing you to do mental acrobatics.Any review of Inception would be incomplete if it didn't also mention the visuals of the film.  In short, they are nothing less than breathtaking.  For me, I am often drawn out of the moment of a film by wondering ""how did they do that?"" or thinking ""wow, this CGI is horrible.""  There was little to no moments for me like that in this movie - I was completely engrossed the entire time, and the computer graphics (what there is of them) blend seamlessly into the rest of the film.While I know that The Dark Knight made a bigger box office draw (thus far), I believe that this will be known as Christopher Nolan's masterpiece.  He truly creates a different world for the viewer.  Plus, if the last five to ten seconds of the film aren't a conversation starter, then I don't know what is.

The stellar cast - Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine, boost the film to levels beyond comprehension.Inception is a film that must be watched twice to be comprehended, much less understood.It's original plot and premise will take you by surprise, and really make you think.It's equal parts sci-fi, action, thriller, and heist film.Inception draws on films like The Matrix, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, yet is totally original - straight for the mind of Christopher Nolan, where it germinated for 10 years.Is Inception overrated? Probably, in fact, YES, it's overrated. The hype has overrated, just as it has overrated The Dark Knight (another equally brilliant film).It's great, but not perfect.However, Inception is  thought-provoking, well-acted, action packed, moving, exciting, MIND- BLOWING sci-fi action heist!I highly recommend watching it for yourself!P.S.

Sexton,"[3, 5]","Christopher Nolan has become one of those select few directors who can bring complex and subversive ideas to projects that can be dressed to effectively entertain the movie-going public. He's had a consistent track record and major success with his two Batman films that only at this point in his career (with a script he's worked on for over a decade) could he possibly deliver a movie like this under the cautious eyes of a major studio. And the gamble paid off. Inception was a crowd pleaser and critical hit, not to mention one of the handful of great films in the fog of a dismal summer lineup for 2010. Fortunately for us, the movie inspires if not demands us to return to it repeatedly and the blu-ray edition is the best way to keep returning to it.The presentation of the film is perfect in high-definition. Great detail is on display and colors and contrast are well-balanced. The DTS-HD Master 5.1 audio track is very robust, too. The sound effects and Hans Zimmer's score really stand out here. There's no commentary track from Nolan (I don't think he's done one since Memento) but the Extraction Mode - a collection of specific behind-the-scenes mini-docs you can play during the film or separately - takes care of that, providing more than enough info about the challenges of bringing this film into fruition. All together, you've got under an hour of material here and I prefer watching them separately. And that's on the first disc.The second disc has a fascinating documentary about dream research, a comic-book style prologue to how DiCaprio and Gordon-Levitt acquired the job they perform at the beginning of the movie (it's decent but it doesn't give you anything that'll make you appreciate the film any more), 10 isolated tracks from the film's score (very nice), conceptual art and promotional materials. I haven't bothered with the bd-live content yet.All in all, a great package. The blu-rays are wonderful and they even sweetened the deal with throwing in a movie-only dvd and digital copy code.

1304872,AHZJ4KTYBQ5KP,B002ZG980U,Avrohom Leichtling,"[5, 10]","My comments about the film are focused on Hans Zimmer's score, and not the film itself. Many others have discussed the merits and demerits of this movie. I find myself a partisan of it - in conception and execution it is, with one notable exception, an intelligent and entertaining film which I recommend highly, especially in its bluray incarnation. However...As a professional composer who has also had a lifelong interest in ""movie music"" (Bernard Herrmann was a correspondent and teacher), I often find myself assaulted by what I will call ""The Curse of John Williams."" Williams is a very gifted composer, both of film music and of concert works as well, but the wall-to-wall music film-score aesthetic which he brought back into fashion beginning with Star Wars in 1977 has long since morphed into the standard method whereby film composers approach their tasks under the fashion that says, in effect, ""people are stupid and need aural cues at every possible moment to tell them what to think and how to feel."" Thus, especially in the realm of fantasy and science-fiction, we have an endless stream of film scores whose opening title to end title continuity leave me utterly exhausted, aurally fatigued by the incessant blather of overcooked, hyperventilating accompaniments whose minimalist compositional techniques have all but destroyed the effect of music in film.Bernard Herrmann's operating principal was ""less is more"" - an attitude developed during his pre-Hollywood years as a composer of scores for radio dramas. When he made the transition to film, his overriding sense of economy and brevity made his contributions to the various films he scored all the more effective precisely because they were not constant - because they were present only when the dramaturgical flow of the film required the additional aural element to complete the visual. Herrmann was one of the very first minimalist composers, long before John Adams, Terry Riley, Philip Glass, and all the other minimalists came on the scene, indeed before minimalism was a definable musical technique. As we know, minimalism became an end in and of itself, and not a means to an end. Our current crop of Hollywood composers have largely if not entirely, it seems to me, bought into the utter and total corruption of Herrmann's ""less is more"" and have turned it into ""more less is more.""The most recent, and for my money, egregious example of this is Hans Zimmer's score for the Christopher Nolan film ""Inception."" When I saw the film in its ""live"" environment, that is, in the movie house, Zimmer's score, never for a minute approaching anything even remotely subtle or understated, was intrusive in a way that seemed to have crossed over into new territories of aural overkill. When I acquired the recently released BluRay version of the film, and then watched it on my home theater system, both my wife and I were overwhelmed by the sheer chutzpah, the noise level, the unceasing repetition, over and over and over again, of the same musical figures absolutely without development, extension or variation. The phenomenal clarity of both the visual and audio elements drove home the point that this score, for all its synthesized and ""live"" musical elements, was totally inappropriate both in terms of conception and execution. It was often impossible for us to hear dialogue clearly, even though the bluray realization places most all of the dialogue clearly in the center front channels. I cannot fathom Nolan's approval of this kind of overkill. But I am reminded of the story Herrmann told about his adventures with William Friedkin when Friedkin asked him to score The Exorcist. Herrmann was, if nothing else, perhaps the single most original and imaginative film composer - and when he told Friedkin that he would use many French Horns in the score, Friedkin told him that he didn't want anything French in the music! Utter stupidity and ignorance there for a certainty. Zimmer's patented overkill strikes me as director Nolan's equivalent.Now Zimmer is indeed a talented composer even as his scores have their characteristic bloated overstatement. But, with Inception, the score is so exaggerated and the presentation, especially in 7 channel bluray, so intrusive as to destroy what is otherwise a marvelously ingenious and engrossing film. I am not stupid. I don't need the Wagnerian leit-motiv method pushed beyond the outer limits. I do not ever want music in a film to overwhelm absolutely every other element. And, I certainly don't want to walk away from a film annoyed to the point of distraction by a score which shows not a whit of respect for the audience listening to it in the context for which it was composed.I protest!",5,Inception: On the egregious misuse of music in a motion picture,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,4718,"['comments', 'film', 'are', 'focused', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'not',

However, rather than follow the traditional routes of industrial espionage, he uses cutting-edge technology to extract this information from his targets' dreams. This can be a dangerous task, with the infiltrators at risk from the target's subconscious, but Cobb is the best in his field.Exiled from the USA for undisclosed reasons, Cobb is desperate to return home and see his children. His latest employer claims that he can make this happen, but only if Cobb can perform the impossible: inception, placing an idea so deeply in the target's subconscious that they believe they came up with it themselves. Cobb has never managed to succeed at this before, but relishes the challenge and the reward. He assembles a team of the very best in their field to mount a reverse-heist into the unconscious of a top businessman, but can he leave his own past behind?Inception was one of the more heavily-acclaimed movies of 2010, a complex SF thriller helmed by director-of-the-moment Christopher Nolan (The Prestige, The Dark Knight). Its cerebral and complex premise was feared to be off-putting to casual audiences, but the film took an impressive $820 million at the box office and demonstrated that a clever film could still be a break-out hit. At least that's the narrative that's been spread around by various critics. Actually Inception's complexity is more about asking the audience to retain information and maintain a keen eye for detail. The film isn't really ambiguous (aside from a slightly cheesy final shot that screams ""The End...OR IS IT?!?"") and the rules of the dream-hacking and details of the heist are pretty well-laid-out by clearly-related expositionary sequences.Like The Matrix, the film isn't as original as it first appears but melds its ideas with compelling action sequences (a fistfight in a hallway with the exterior gravity switching around is an impressive highlight) and use of CGI (Paris wrapping itself into a giant ball is a staggering visual idea, executed flawlessly). It lacks the confused cod-philosophy of The Matrix's weaker sequels though, instead focusing on the characters of Cobb (a damaged, somewhat arrogant man) and his team-members, particularly Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Eames (Tom Hardy), Ariadne (Ellen Page), Saito (Ken Watanabe) and their mark, Robert Fisher (Cillian Murphy), well-written characters who stand out alongside the film's impressive visuals and more complex ideas.The film's SF influences are intriguing. Previously Nolan had worked with Christopher Priest on The Prestige and Inception feels very much like a Priest novel reworked to include more explosions and machine guns. The big difference between them is that Priest loves ambiguity whilst Nolan is less interested in leaving open questions, with only the very final shot leaving the story open to further interpretations. The DNA of Philip K. Dick can also be seen in the ""What is reality?"" question that pops up throughout the film, not to mention the vast and imposing SF city that we encounter in the final act.The film falters occasionally. Like The Dark Knight the film occasionally feels weighed down by maybe one or two too many subplots (though vastly less of a problem than on The Dark Knight, which sometimes loses focus as a result of this). Whilst the film has a strong emotional core with regards to Cobb's relationship with his deceased wife and his desire to be reunited with his children, in other areas the film is less emotionally engaging.

The science-fiction premise of the story is that it's possible to go into another person's dreams, and manipulate events and perceptions in those dreams, with the intent of extracting information. The supposedly easy task is getting ideas out of a person's head. On the other hand, but putting ideas in, creating thoughts (inception) is infinitely harder. The storytelling structure of the film generally follows a classic caper outline. This being... one man needs to get something secret/difficult/illegal done, so he assembles a team of strange bedfellows, who are often at odds with each other. Along the way the team members exhibit various surprising strengths and weaknesses, and there is at least one twist at the end. Yup, classic. The filmmakers pull it off with style. My only complaint is towards the end of the movie... the film bends a few early-established rules of the dream-universe to make later events fit the story, and the rule bending gets rather flagrant at the very end. But it's a minor irritant that is overwhelmed by the fine production and acting. Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page are electric on screen.

I really want to go back to it, and watch it again and again. If you get this Blu-ray edition, you get the digital copy, which is really cool to take with you on your iPhone or iPad, the DVD, and also an extra disc with extras. One of the extras is a selection of Hans Zimmer soundtrack. The selection is 10 out of the total 12 tracks of the soundtrack, so it is like getting almost the whole thing. The movie won 4 Academy awards, and although it missed the best picture and best director, I can assure you will not be disappointed by this movie. Christopher Nolan is a great director, and he did not only directed, but he wrote this movie as well. This is remarkable, because he is the guy who wrote Memento, and if you watched Memento, then this movie kind of makes sense.This movie is about dreams, and how perception of dreams can be so real that we have a really hard time telling the difference from what's real and what's a dream (this is you believe that dreams are not real, which I do believe they are...). Anyhow, philosophic quests aside, the visuals of the movie are unbelievable, with special effects that leave you breathless. The acting is top notch, and I have to admit that I learned to love DiCaprio more and more. He has become one of the best Hollywood actors for the last 5/6 years, and I would not be surprised if he is nominated for an Academy award very soon, because he deserves it. Supporting acting is very good as well, specially Tom Hardy, a great discovery for the film industry.This Blu-ray comes with several extras, among those an 'extraction mode' that allows you to watch the movie with short documentaries in between explaining how the visual effects were created. I already spoke about the Zimmer soundtrack, which is mesmerizing and ver effective in creating the appropriate mood for this movie, and all I can say to finish my review is that I highly and strongly recommend everyone to check this movie out. Thanks for reading!p.s. I forgot to mention ... if you are so confused after watching this movie, like I was after my first time, you can watch it over (again and again), and you can also visit imdb.com where there is a FAQ with at least 60 different questions related to the plot, etc. Needless to say, those FAQs contain spoilers, but you may want to check them out anyway (at your own risk...).",5,Endless entertainment,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,2475,"['movie', 'brilliant', 'outstanding', 'watched', 'weekend', 'two', 'consecutive', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'mind', 'really', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'get', 'digital', 'copy', 'really', 'cool', 'take', 'iPhone', 'iPad', 'DVD', 'also', 'extra', 'disc', 'extras', 'One', 'extras', 'selection', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'soundtrack', 'selection', '10', 'total', '12', 'tracks', 'soundtrack', 'getting', 'almost', 'whole', 'thing', 'movie', 'won', '4', 'Academy', 'awards', 'missed', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'director', 'can', 'assure', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'great', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'only', 'directed', 'wrote', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'remarkable', 'guy', 'who', 'wrote', 'Memento', 'watched', 'Memento', 'then', 'movie', 'kind', 'sense.This', 'movie', 'dreams', 'how', 'perception', 'dreams', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'real', 'have', 'really', 'hard', 'time', 'telling', 'difference', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'dream', 'believe', 'dreams', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'do', 'believe', 'are', 'Anyhow', 'philosophic', 'quests', 'aside', 'visuals', 'movie', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'special', 'effects', 'leave', 'breathless', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'have', 'admit', 'learned', 'love', 'DiCaprio', 'more', 'more', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'last', '5/6', 'years', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'award', 'very', 'soon', 'Supporting', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'specially', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'great', 'discovery', 'film', 'industry.This', 'Blu-ray', 'several', 'extras', ""'extraction"", 'mode', 'watch', 'movie', 'short', 'documentaries', 'explaining', 'how', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'created', 'already', 'spoke', 'Zimmer', 'soundtrack', 'mesmerizing', 'ver', 'effective', 'creating', 'appropriate', 'mood', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'finish', 'review', 'highly', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'Thanks', 'reading', 'p.s', 'forgot', 'mention', 'are', 'so', 'confused', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'again', 'can', 'also', 'visit', 'imdb.com', 'where', 'FAQ', 'least', '60', 'different', 'questions', 'related', 'plot', 'etc', 'Needless', 'say', 'FAQs', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'anyway', 'own', 'risk']",N/A

There's some superficial plot similarities between the two, but what struck me about both was how many really cool images and ideas both had.  It also struck me that despite all of the awesome action, elaborate set pieces and cool moments, both Neuromancer and Inception failed to connect with me on anything other than a purely visceral level.  Inception fails in the same way Neuromancer did.  It's too focused on the various plot machinations and rules that govern it's universe, and it fails to give the character side of the equation as much loving attention.First with the superlatives.  This is a very entertaining and exciting movie.  I was particularly impressed with Christopher Nolan's staging of the action sequences.  I found a lot of the Dark Knight's big set pieces to be too messy.  There was a lot of quick cuts and choppy sequences.  Inception's action sequences didn't seem to have this problem.  I also found a few scenes incredibly imaginative.  The hallway scene in particular was very well staged and thought out.  Most importantly, the action felt much more clear and purposeful than in his Batman films.The ideas in Inception are also very promising.  I enjoy films about dreams because they afford filmmakers the opportunity to get completely lost inside someones head.  Inception doesn't really use the dreams to examine psychology too deeply.  Rather they're used as elaborate staging grounds for mind bending action.  I liked the different take on dreams, and it made for some very good action sequences.Now for some criticisms.  A lot of sci-fi seems to focus to much on the world it's building and not enough on the characters who inhabit the world.  Cobb is given a tortured back story about his wife, but the relationship between the two never moved me in any kind of way.  It's seemed typically Hollywood to me, and it felt out of place among all of the unconventional ideas and set pieces.And what about the rest of the team?  Besides Robert Fischer, who gets quite a bit of back story and motivation, the rest of the team are basically cyphers.  I would have appreciated a bit more characterization of Arthur or Eames to flesh out why I should care about these folks.Inception is an entertaining movie with a lot of great action sequences.  Technically, it's a brilliant piece of film making.  Nolan knows how to entertain and please a crowd.  You should see this if you're at all a fan of action films.  I've avoided any interpretation here, but it's worth checking out online some of the theories and explanation about how the film works.I have one minor quibble about the DVD.  I got the bear bones DVD edition at a gift exchange, and I believe that the dialogue is mixed too quiet while the music and the sound effects are mixed to loud.  I had to turn up the volume to hear the characters talk but turn it down when there was an explosion in an attempt to not piss off my neighbors.",4,Great Ideas Without Any Real Connection,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,3040,"['As', 'soon', 'finished', 'watching', 'Inception', 'first', 'comparison', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'William', ""Gibson'sNeuromancer"", 'superficial', 'plot', 'similarities', 'two', 'what', 'struck', 'was', 'how', 'many', 'really', 'cool', 'images', 'ideas', 'had', 'also', 'struck', 'awesome', 'action', 'elaborate', 'set', 'pieces', 'cool', 'moments', 'Neuromancer', 'Inception', 'failed', 'connect', 'anything', 'other', 'purely', 'visceral', 'level', 'Inception', 'same', 'way', 'Neuromancer', 'did', 'too', 'focused', 'various', 'plot', 'machinations', 'rules', 'govern', 'universe', 'give', 'character', 'side', 'equation', 'much', 'loving', 'attention.First', 'superlatives', 'very', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'movie', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'staging', 'action', 'sequences', 'found', 'lot', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'big', 'set', 'pieces', 'be', 'too', 'messy', 'was', 'lot', 'quick', 'cuts', 'choppy', 'sequences', 'Inception', 'action', 'sequences', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'problem', 'also', 'found', 'few', 'scenes', 'incredibly', 'imaginative', 'hallway', 'scene', 'particular', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'staged', 'thought', 'out', 'Most', 'importantly', 'action', 'felt', 'much', 'more', 'clear', 'purposeful', 'Batman', 'films.The', 'ideas', 'Inception', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'promising', 'enjoy', 'films', 'dreams', 'afford', 'opportunity', 'get', 'completely', 'lost', 'someones', 'head', 'Inception', ""n't"", 'really', 'use', 'dreams', 'examine', 'psychology', 'too', 'deeply', ""'re"", 'used', 'elaborate', 'staging', 'grounds', 'mind', 'bending', 'action', 'liked', 'different', 'take', 'dreams', 'made', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'sequences.Now', 'criticisms', 'lot', 'sci-fi', 'focus', 'much', 'world', 'building', 'not', 'enough', 'characters', 'who', 'inhabit', 'world', 'Cobb', 'given', 'tortured', 'back', 'story', 'wife', 'relationship', 'two', 'never', 'moved', 'kind', 'way', 'seemed', 'typically', 'Hollywood', 'felt', 'place', 'unconventional', 'ideas', 'set', 'pieces.And', 'what', 'rest', 'team', 'Robert', 'Fischer', 'who', 'quite', 'bit', 'back', 'story', 'motivation', 'rest', 'team', 'are', 'basically', 'cyphers', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'bit', 'more', 'characterization', 'Arthur', 'Eames', 'flesh', 'out', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'folks.Inception', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'lot', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'Technically', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'Nolan', 'how', 'entertain', 'please', 'crowd', 'should', 'see', ""'re"", 'fan', 'action', 'films', ""'ve"", 'avoided', 'interpretation', 'here', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'online', 'theories', 'explanation', 'how', 'film', 'have', 'one', 'minor', 'quibble', 'DVD', 'got', 'bear', 'bones', 'DVD', 'edition', 'gift', 'exchange', 'believe', 'dialogue', 'mixed', 'too', 'quiet', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'mixed', 'loud', 'had', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'hear', 'characters', 'talk', 'turn', 'down', 'when', 'was', 'explosion', 'attempt', 'not', 'piss', 'off', 'neighbors']",N/A
1304890,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002ZG980U,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 0]","I saw director Christopher Nolan's latest filmmaking masterpiece, Inception (2010), on Opening Day. My one word to summarize this flick is AWESOME. This is truly a stunning piece of cinema in just about every way.  I give it 5 out of 5 stars.  The story is well written, suspenseful, and interesting...the acting is top notch...the music is phenomenal (Hans Zimmer of course)...the cinematography spectacular...and the special effects are incredible.  And it's a big budget summer blockbuster that is sure to make hundreds of millions if not a billion dollars.  While this film won't beat Avatar (2009) at the box office, it's the film that I wish Avatar was.  It's the film that's better than the 10 films nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 2009.  It's both an action/thriller/suspense juggernaut and a contemplative philosophical/psychological labyrinth.  It's rare now days that a movie can get me just purely excited like a kid on a sugar high, antsy to see a movie on opening day.  But also get my mind and soul intrigued and stimulated as an adult.  Inception is one of those rare movies that does that and got me into the theater on opening day...at 10 AM no less!  The last film I think that did that was Gladiator (2000).  This has got to be an Oscar contender for 2010 considering that The Dark Knight (2008), also directed by Nolan, was nominated for 8 Oscars and won 2, including Heath Ledger's posthumous win for Best Supporting Actor. And this movie far surpasses The Dark Knight in my humble opinion, as much as I enjoyed that picture as well.  My biggest quandary is now how to fit this film into my Top 100 movie list, where it definitely belongs. It's definitely the best film of 2010 so far.  And one of the best in the last decade. It's movies like this that inspire me to be both an Architect and a Filmmaker.  And ironically, this movie is a lot about architecture.  Architecture of both buildings and the mind.  I've known this for awhile, but it's so clear to me now that I became an Architect to become a Filmmaker.  My frustration with architecture in reality is that it isn't as spectacular as the architecture I build in my mind.  And movies are the place where the two meet.If you want a good review of the plot of this movie, read Roger Ebert's review.  I really won't even attempt to summarize this film...it would be too much work, and honestly, you just have to see it...in the theater on the big screen!  That's the power and beauty of great films is that they really defy words alone.  That's why they are on film IMO. You've got to experience them with all of your senses to fully feel them and understand them. Like the title and premise of the movie, this movie has planted ideas in my head that keep building and now I can't stop thinking about this movie, as well as its meaning for my own life.  The best films do that...they seep in to our subconscious and plant themselves there, causing god only knows what.  And there is the idea of Inception, fully realized in film as well as life itself.  Nolan has obviously crafted this story from ideas within his mind and its influences from the world of film and his own life experiences. I can definitely see the influences of his own films like Memento (2000) and Insomnia (2002), both films about the psychology of the mind.  But of course there is also a bit of The Matrix (1999) and The Bourne Identity (2002) within Inception as well.  And while Inception does feel a little familiar at times because of all of its influences, I let that slide.  Film is not a static environment and filmmakers are certainly influenced by other films like any other aspect of our culture. We're really telling the same stories that the Greeks told thousands of years ago.  They've just got a different context and upgraded visuals.I watched Memento this afternoon as well.  I had recorded it earlier in the week on my DVR after being reminded of it from something about Inception/Nolan.  It was only the second time I've seen the movie, the first being 9 or 10 years ago when it came out on DVD.  I remember that I really didn't ""get"" Memento the first time and didn't really appreciate it.  The way the story was told was complex, being told both backwards and forwards at the same time, in fragments.  I think it was partly due to my young age that I just didn't appreciate Memento as much back then. But I really appreciated it today.  It's not at the same level as Inception, but the ideas at its core go hand in hand with it.  The questions of ""reality"" that Nolan poses in both Memento and Inception are interesting to say the least.  Memento is a much smaller scale film but I see now how influential it was now to Nolan himself, as well as the rest of the world of film. The film (500) Days of Summer, with its jumbled fragmented timeline, owes a nod to Memento. And apparently Nolan started working on the story and screenplay for Inception while filming Memento.There are many thoughts, ideas, and feelings that I got from Inception today going through me.  And I doubt I will fully realize them all in this blog right now.  I also think that Inception is one of those movies like The Matrix or Memento that needs to be seen a second time to get a better grasp on it. Once you get through it once, you can pay attention to details that are hard to maybe keep up with the first time when you are simply trying to stay with the story. I'm probably going to see this one again in the theater in the next few weeks. I captured a lot of screen stills from the trailers to this film...this simply such a visually stunning movie...enjoy all of them!",5,Wake me up...but not before the dream ends,1286236800,"10 5,

1304891,A1P7O2PAA8H1DD,B002ZG980U,Blade329,"[4, 5]","I really liked this movie.  It's a very involved plot that revolves around manipulating dreams.  DiCaprio, who is always good, runs a small band of dream Extractors.  They use a machine and chemicals to plant themselves into the dreams of others, usually to steal corporate data.  Sounds easy enough, but there are ways to guard against people invading your thoughts while you sleep.  There are ways to train your mind to resist such intrusions.  This manifests itself as the subconscious creating armed guards to fight off the intruders.  So what you get are some very entertaining ""Matrix"" like battles in the dream.  The name of the movie, ""Inception"", refers to the act of planting an idea in someone's subconscious and making them believe it's their own idea.  This is considered an almost impossible feat and requires delving very very deep within someone's subconscious.  This means going into dreams within dreams and so forth.  Complicating matters is the fact that DiCaprio's character has some deep problems in his subconscious.  The projections of his wife keep showing up in his dreams trying to unravel all his plans.  It's an amazing movie.  The plot is very complex and can sometimes wrap itself up like a pretzel, so you really have to pay attention.The Blu Ray quality is great.

Anyone following Nolan's career will be already familiar with Memento. Memento and Inception, conceptually different, are similar in their approach to filmmaking. Above anything else, both are mind blowing experiences with extraordinary concepts that only someone like Nolan, in this visceral blockbuster era, could conceive. I found his Batman output notable, but, of course, he was attempting to give new life to a franchise that for long seemed doomed for light entertainment. Here, he is back in his comfort zone, creating and developing inventive concepts from sketch.Describing the plot of Inception in such a short space would be both difficult and inadequate. Inception is a journey within the depths of the human mind, via a process named extraction, accessing the most obscure and fascinating concept: dreams. Through the tools at hand, the characters are able to enter the dreams of others and understand the secrets of the subject via their subconscious. However, the subconscious is not only occupied with the subject and the ""intruder,"" as its limitless scope and design allows for countless different and eclectic additional characters and objects. In addition, some people have been trained against such invasions, and have a particularly strong and proficient defense system.The protagonist of the tale is Dominic Cobb, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, who is a successful and intelligent extractor. His personal and professional troubles have for a time forced him to live outside of the United States, away from his children. Accepting the fact that he possibly will never see his children, for he would be arrested and jailed for many years if he were to return to the country, he decides to lay low and eventually get work in another country. However, a wealthy man, Saito, whom he is familiar with due to prior extraction missions, offers him a final job. This job, however, is more challenging than any extraction they have ever performed. On this mission, they must incept the mind of Robert Fischer, heir to a wealthy corporation. Robert Fischer's father is close to death, and Saito wants to make sure that his corporate rival disintegrates the company. As a result, they must incept his mind, and grant him new ideas about his relationship with his father and Godfather, Peter Browning. For the completion of this task, they use sedatives that would grant them to dream within the dreams. They eventually are able to get close enough to Robert to enter his dreams. Unfortunately, even with all their preparation, they experience countless setbacks that endanger the mission and their life outside of the dream world.If inception failed in character and story development, acting, directing, cinematography, and many other aspects of the film it still would be an undeniably original concept. Though it will be compared to The Matrix, and possibly Dark City, this film is more original in its jargon, while something like the Matrix was largely influenced by countless different schools of philosophy. The concept of the dreams is unique and entirely original, and in years to come it will be imitated but never bettered. Many studies have shown that the vocabulary of British films have for long been more widespread than American films. Inception may be an exception. Instead of focusing on the F word, which films of all genres have for long found an affinity for, Inception actually uses some elaborate terms-at least for a Hollywood film. This is not necessarily an intellectual film, as it is entirely fictional. However, Inception's pseudo-intellectuality still makes the viewer think and see if Inception's own rules are logically applied. This is a visceral experience, like Transformers, but our mind is constantly active, trying to interpret all the countless information and new ideas that Nolan throws our way.As you see, I have quite an affinity for this genuinely inventive films, so, why the seemingly derogative heading? This film, possibly due its ingenuity, has been compared to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. In ways, it is unfair to compare the acclaimed science-fiction film to an exceptional Hollywood blockbuster. Maybe, just as the detractors of 2001 decreased by numbers, Inception's critic may have to eat their words in the foreseeable future. However, there is a place where the comparison is applicable. Kubrick's film is possibly the most implicit film ever created, where nearly every segment has countless interpretations and the film rarely shows us its explicit side. In 2001, Kubrick created an entirely implicit experience, unexpected of the director of Spartacus and Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Many years after the first film, Arthur C. Clark released a sequel, 2010: Odyssey Two, which was eventually adapted. As much as the earlier film was implicit, 2010 was explicit and Hollywood entertainment. Of course, the magic was lost, as it tried direly to make the audience, possibly the ones who were bored by the first film, understand the points only hinted by 2001. Inception is 2010, while it could have more elegantly become 2001. This film is undeniably complex, proven by the fact that Nolan explains every single detail of extraction and inception. We need some information about this original concept, but every part of the process is so heavily explained that it leaves nothing to the imagination. Nolan explains everything to such a degree that we truly feel like observers and outsiders to these characters world. If it had been suggestive in some areas, our intellect could have been truly engaged and this film would have been a true cerebral experience. Unfortunately, we gaze at the film with fascination, trying to always comprehend its thread of complexity. We may be confused at moments, but rarely are we bewilderingly lost in the picture. Unfortunately, Nolan is trapped in the blockbuster world, where studios demand clarity from the narrative. In other words, there is a much more implicit and majestic film buried from the view of the still powerful Inception.Inception may be a blockbuster with expected top-notch actors, but it has much more personality, focus, and drive than the average Hollywood product. The fact that Nolan could have created such an original film in such a predictable era is testament to his immense talent as one of the most fascinating directors of recent times, with only Tarantino as his rival. There has been much talk about the final scene and moments of the film, and its implications. On Inception's Wikipedia page, there appears a solid explanation for the ending but that is unfortunate. If Nolan is not aiming for a sequel, which I hope not, the open-ended ending brilliantly matches, and possibly defines this mystifying film and is proof of the audacity of Nolan's vision.",3,"Immensely original, fascinating and satisfactory experience...However; Kubrick had more guts than Nolan!",1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,7183,"['Note', 'ideal', 'world', 'would', 'grant',

If you are the type of movie watcher that can not handle a detailed movie plot than I would suggest you rent ""Devil"" or something like that.

I didn't like Shutter's Island either I fell asleep soon after the opening credits.I will try to sum the movie up for those who want to know the storyline: In my opinion it was about criminal minded people (Dicaprio) and his buddies kidnapping people and entering their dreams only to twist their thoughts so back in reality they get whatever it is they want that person to do or think ..

So, of course, I watched it twice.  Bear with me: I only did it because I hate to see otherwise civilized moviegoers at each others' throats over what's meant to be a couple hours' entertainment.On first viewing, not having read anything but a plot summary about it, I approached 'Inception' (as I think most will) as having a level that serves as a control, that is, 'reality.'  For those with a heightened ability to suspend their disbelief, regardless of how dazzlingly opaque that which is presented to you, you may love the detail, action, plot twists and other conceptual artifice here, and go to bed feeling warm and satisfied. Five stars!  On the other hand, if you're a stick in the mud (like me) and have the type of mind that analyzes-- and accordingly accepts or rejects-- a movie's various premises as you go, you will have all kinds of problems with the logic of 'Inception,' go into a fit, call your lawyer and demand changes to your will that include Christopher Nolan being declared a charlatan somewhere in your epitaph.

For those who need examples:  Cobb tells Mal 'I don't trust you anymore,' then moments later proceeds to tie himself to her and rappel down the side of a building (I needn't bother getting into the physics of a 100-pound woman supporting the weight of a 150-pound man because-- ta-da!-- it was just a dream); in reality, pain in dreams is caused by conscious pain, not the other way around; the idea of 'inception' has been practiced since the 19th century in the forms of brainwashing and hypnotic suggestion and therefore the notion, posited by Arthur, that 'true inspiration is impossible to fake' would demonstrate a near-total ignorance of his own field of expertise; Cobb operates under the supposition that in dreams the dreamer doesn't 'know it's happening,' but most if not all of us have had dreams where we're fully aware we're in a dream and have control over all aspects of it-- his theories fall apart then; the idea of the totem is fun and an important plot thread but, again, the mind plays tricks on us, and what might be a rabbit's foot in real life could easily turn into a rubber chicken in a dream; Saito's oversimplistic explanation of Fischer's conglomerate becoming a world superpower is laughably weak, even for a MacGuffin, anywhere outside the world of James Bond; a sedative leaving inner-ear functions intact presumably would be useful only if the subject were 'kicked' in reality, not inside his dream; and so on.Now, before you 'believers' get upset, here's the part where I read a bunch of reviews and decide to give 'Inception' a second chance, this time from the perspective that the entire film is Cobb's conceit, several convoluted layers of dream plot and dream characters devised to fool himself in order to 'self-incept,' as it were, to gain safe passage 'home,' i.e., reunite with his family, whether they even actually exist or not.  I have to say the movie is a hell of a lot easier to digest this way, because nothing that is said or done has to make sense, as it all serves Cobb's imagined quest.  It's still overlong and too crammed with generic action-movie fluff for my taste, but at least you can appreciate what director Nolan might have been aiming for, unburdened by the chore of trying to decipher what is essentially undecipherable (OK, OK, let's call it 'subjective') material.  Three stars!I'm sure my fence-straddling will still offend some, but perhaps if fans and critics can find common ground at least on how to approach 'Inception' the armies of our subconscious can lay down their arms and let us dream in peace.",3,My subconscious is killing me...,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,4033,"['lot', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', ""'Inception"", 'too', 'much', 'dialog', 'exposition', 'too', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'chases', 'explosions', 'overdose', 'pseudopsychological', 'pretense', 'certainly', 'film', 'be', 'limits', 'human', 'imagination', 'So', 'course', 'watched', 'twice', 'Bear', 'only', 'did', 'hate', 'see', 'otherwise', 'civilized', 'moviegoers', 'others', 'throats', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'couple', 'hours', 'entertainment.On', 'first', 'viewing', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'anything', 'plot', 'summary', 'approached', ""'Inception"", 'think', 'most', 'will', 'having', 'level', 'control', ""'reality"", 'heightened', 'ability', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'regardless', 'how', 'dazzlingly', 'opaque', 'presented', 'may', 'love', 'detail', 'action', 'plot', 'twists', 'other', 'conceptual', 'artifice', 'here', 'go', 'bed', 'feeling', 'warm', 'satisfied', 'Five', 'stars', 'other', 'hand', ""'re"", 'stick', 'mud', 'have', 'type', 'mind', 'accordingly', 'accepts', 'rejects', 'movie', 'various', 'premises', 'go', 'will', 'have', 'kinds', 'problems', 'logic', ""'Inception"", 'go', 'fit', 'call', 'lawyer', 'demand', 'changes', 'will', 'include', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'being', 'declared', 'charlatan', 'somewhere', 'epitaph', 'One', 'star', 'latter', 'point', 'inconsistencies', 'junk', ""'dream"", 'science', 'make', 'watching', ""'Inception"", 'almost', 'unbearable', 'first', 'hour', 'brain', 'simply', 'down', 'who', 'need', 'examples', 'Cobb', 'Mal', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'anymore', 'then', 'moments', 'later', 'proceeds', 'tie', 'rappel', 'down', 'side', 'building', 'need', ""n't"", 'bother', 'getting', 'physics', '100-pound', 'woman', 'supporting', 'weight', '150-pound', 'man', 'ta-da', 'was', 'just', 'dream', 'reality', 'pain', 'dreams', 'caused', 'conscious', 'pain', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'idea', ""'inception"", 'been', 'practiced', '19th', 'century', 'forms', 'brainwashing', 'hypnotic', 'suggestion', 'therefore', 'notion', 'posited', 'Arthur', ""'true"", 'inspiration', 'impossible', 'fake', 'would', 'demonstrate', 'near-total', 'ignorance', 'own', 'field', 'expertise', 'Cobb', 'supposition', 'dreams', 'dreamer', ""n't"", ""'know"", 'happening', 'most', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'dreams', 'where', ""'re"", 'fully', 'aware', ""'re"", 'dream', 'have', 'control', 'aspects', 'theories', 'fall', 'apart', 'then', 'idea', 'totem', 'fun', 'important', 'plot', 'thread', 'again', 'mind', 'tricks', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'rabbit', 'foot', 'real', 'life', 'could', 'easily', 'turn', 'rubber', 'chicken', 'dream', 'Saito', 'oversimplistic', 'explanation', 'Fischer', 'conglomerate', 'becoming', 'world', 'superpower', 'laughably', 'weak', 'even', 'MacGuffin', 'anywhere', 'world', 'James', 'Bond', 'sedative', 'leaving', 'inner-ear', 'functions', 'intact', 'presumably', 'would', 'be', 'useful', 'only', 'subject', 'were', ""'kicked"", 'reality', 'not', 'dream', 'so', 'on.Now', ""'believers"", 'get', 'upset', 'here', 'part', 'where', 'read', 'bunch', 'reviews', 'decide', 'give', ""'Inception"", 'second', 'chance', 'time', 'perspective', 'entire', 'film', 'Cobb', 'conceit', 'several', 'convoluted', 'layers', 'dream', 'plot', 'dream', 'characters', 'devised', 'fool', 'order', ""'self-incept"", 'were', 'gain', 'safe', 'passage', ""'home"", 'i.e.', 'reunite', 'family', 'even', 'actually', 'exist', 'not', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'hell', 'lot', 'easier', 'digest', 'way', 'nothing', 'said', 'done', 'make', 'sense', 'Cobb', 'imagined', 'quest', 'still', 'overlong', 'too', 'crammed', 'generic', 'action-movie', 'fluff', 'taste', 'least', 'can', 'appreciate', 'what', 'director', 'Nolan', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'aiming', 'unburdened', 'chore', 'trying', 'decipher', 'what', 'essentially', 'undecipherable', 'OK', 'OK', 'let', 'call', ""'subjective"", 'material', 'Three', 'stars', ""'m"", 'sure', 'fence-straddling', 'will', 'still', 'offend', 'perhaps', 'fans', 'critics', 'can', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'least', 'how', 'approach', ""'Inception"", 'armies', 'subconscious', 'can', 'lay', 'down', 'arms', 'let', 'dream', 'peace']",N/A

1304912,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B002ZG980U,Caleb Williams,"[2, 5]","Christopher Nolan, being relatively unknown until he rebooted the Batman franchise, has managed to produce the best film of 2010 and possibly one of the best films of the decade. He manages to take fantasy concepts and bring them into the real world, no matter how crazy they may seem. Batman is one of his projects that he wanted to remove from the comic book fantasy and bring it into the real world to the point the viewer would be thinking ""so this is really possible"". Although it may seem crazy, Inception is one of those movies. Although using technology and ideas that don't yet exist in reality, it uses concepts such as Lucid dreaming and dream incubation and places them in reality. Although it may seem crazy, I think that one day we will develop such an understanding of dreams and the unconscious mind that things such ideas as depicted in the film will be possible.Although being a genius of film making, he's also excellent in confusing the hell out of the viewer, and if you aren't paying attention for the entire runtime, you will find yourself to be absolutely lost. The story centres around dream thieves, Dominick (Leo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Well they're not actual dream thieves, more secret thieves. They dream together and break into the unconscious minds of other sleepy people in the hope of discovering some deep and dark secrets about them. They're approached by Saito (Ken Watanabe) who offers Dominick the freedom to return home to the US (where he's wanted for murder of his wife) if he can perform Inception, the act of planting ideas in the mind of another person through their dreams. The victim of said Inception is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the son of a wealthy business man who is about to inherit a massive corporate empire. In order to carry the inception, Dominick and Arthur employ the services of the dream architect, Ariadne (Ellen Page), identity forger, Eames (Tom Hardy) and the sedative guy, Yusuf (Dileep Rao).If the story didn't sound complicated enough, it goes even deeper into the ideas and concepts of dreams that will really knock you if you aren't paying attention from the start. Involving numerous levels of dreams, you become lost in what is exactly the reality. This is a beautifully crafted film that blends stunning special effects with spectacular acting, dialogue and action. Some scenes are just bizarre but wonderfully put together, such as the scene showing Paris being folded on itself. One particular standout moment, however, is the anti-gravity fight sequence involving Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one of those amazing, but criminally underrated actors. This is a visually mind-blowing scene which becomes a centrepiece of the entire film.This is a genius venture by Nolan and seals his legendary status. He is a true cinematic master and this is just an example of the wondrous stories he can bring to the big screen.

(Would dreams be so grounded in physical laws and realistic settings, and feature such clear-headed thinking?)3.  Watching criminals try to succeed at something evil and nasty for two and half hours was unpleasant.  When is Hollywood gonna learn?  People don't like rooting for the bad guy, even if he is Leonardo Di Caprio.4.  Did anybody really give a toss what was going on between Di Caprio and his wife?5.  The script that's too clever for its own good has certainly been done before:  but this one was utterly predictable.  The final clincher:  ""What is real, and what is not?"" you could see coming from a mile away.  A lot of the movie's so-called ""intelligence"" boiled down to making jump cuts without any explanation, something it couldn't have done had it been a book.

I hate confusing movies.  If I'm in the mood for something that convoluted, I'll just read a book.

The whole ""dream within a dream within a dream"" thing might have worked well on paper, but by the time it hits the screen, the any possible poetic magic is lost:  you're just looking at a street scene.  It's like it was the audience's responsiblity to periodically remind themselves how wondrous the situation is, since the movie was unable to relay that visually.8.

If you have been watching these non-American films, then you know that the exploration of dreams vs. conscious states has been a hallmark of foreign film for decades.  So Christopher Nolan is not striking out onto the bold new frontier as far as his theme for this film.  Yet Christopher Nolan does bring something new to the table that these other filmmakers lacked and that is a physical vision for this dream world.  Thus, for the first time we see rendered in film the physically impossible alterations in the world that cannot take place in our conscious state take place in our dream state instead. This view of our dream world is absolutely breathtaking.  You could watch these sequences without any sound and still be entranced.Like many of the foreign filmmakers he also flirts with the idea that death and dreams are very close.  Thus, the protagonist's seeing of his late wife in his dreams and also his memories or her and his children.  There are questions which repeat throughout the film and you may or not form an answer to these questions by film's end.  It seems Nolan wants you to make up your own mind.  These questions are: 1) Which exact scenes are dreams and which are not? The answer to this is easiest on the scenes where he changes the physical universe so that it defies the law of physics.  2) Which scenes are memories instead of dreams?  This overlaps with the dreams and thus is harder to answer.  3) Does death intervene and end the dreaming process?

1304929,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG980U,Chris Pandolfi,"[6, 9]","It's known that, while dreams are thought to be reflections of the subconscious, they follow no logical pattern and cannot be explained in definite terms. What fascinates me endlessly about Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" is that, while he continuously challenges the audience by toying with perceptions of reality, he sets up dreams and dream states under amazingly intricate rules - every action has a name and a function, every image has a label. What the dreamer envisions can be freely manipulated, yet their creations still serve a purpose and follow a definite pattern. Nothing that happens is a random occurrence. It has all been a part of a grand design. It can also be a shared experience. The film is labyrinthine, disorienting, and ceaselessly hypnotic. It weaves through layers of dream and reality (or perhaps it's reality and dream), and rarely if ever is one distinguishable from the other.Despite heavy psychological subtexts and complex structuring, the general story faithfully adheres to the conventions of a heist movie, with a group of uniquely skilled characters convening for the proverbial Last Job. The protagonist is Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), who hacks into other people's dreams in order to steal their ideas. There are a host of qualifiers for making this happen. First, his clients' backgrounds need to be researched; this is where his associate, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), comes in. Second, he needs someone to literally construct the dream into recognizable physical dimensions - an architect, in other words. Third, he needs keep a personal item, or a totem, available at all times, for the way it behaves lets Cobb know whether or not he's still dreaming. His totem is a spinning top. Forth, he needs a special machine to induce all the team players into a sleeping state, since it's possible for more than one person to take part in the same dream.Cobb is recruited by a powerful billionaire named Saito (Ken Watanabe) to infiltrate the dreams of a business rival named Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy), who is the heir to his father's fortune. The catch is, Saito doesn't want Cobb to steal any of Fischer's ideas; rather, he wants an entirely new idea planted in Fischer's mind via a process called inception, which is not without risks. Cobb's newly recruited dream architect is college student Aridane (Ellen Page), who shows remarkable talent. He also recruits Eames (Tom Hardy), who, once in a dream state, can shape shift his body and appear to be someone else. Finally, he recruits Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who has developed a special sleeping agent for this particular mission.One of the film's more interesting plot devices is the ability to go into a dream state even when already in a dream state. Cobb, his team, and Fischer find themselves in not one, but four layers of sleep, each more unstable than the last until at last a raw subconscious limbo is reached. It's also explained that the mind works faster as it goes deeper into dreams, meaning that, with each layer penetrated, time gets progressively slower. What could have been hopelessly confusing is instead an ingenious building of suspense, Nolan successfully keeping tabs on all four dream states as they work towards their own exciting climaxes. None is more exciting than that of the first state, stretched into a nail-biting slow motion shot broken into periodic fragments. This sequence alone is a triumph of film editing.Cobb is not merely the main character. He's also the story's emotional center, his mind plagued with the image of his wife, Mal (Marion Cottillard), and their two children, who, for reasons I won't reveal, he hasn't seen in a long time. Because of the guilt he feels, he finds that their visions are intruding into other people's dreams, which is not only detrimental to his assignments but also to his own mental health, his ability to do his job rapidly deteriorating. The mysterious nature of the plot prevents us from knowing with absolute certainty whether she's a dream participant or merely a memory resurfacing from Cobb's subconscious. Yes, it appears to be one way, but as we all know, appearances can be deceiving. What can be said for sure is that Cotillard is one of the film's best assets - the perfect counterpart to DiCaprio's psychologically fractured character.If the ending doesn't satisfy you ... well, it isn't supposed to be satisfying. It dares the audience to reflect on what may or may not have happened and then come to the best possible conclusion. It's not about closure, nor is it about revealing what's real and what's a dream. It's all about going through a process. Although he has found success with the reinvention of ""Batman"" (a franchise I persist in believing he's all wrong for), it's movies like ""Inception"" that show Christopher Nolan in top form. Aside from being an engaging and thrilling work of cerebral science fiction, it's a masterpiece of craftsmanship - the screenplay, the character development, the plot, the visual effects, and the performances all handled with precision and care. Nolan truly believed in his idea; if he hadn't, he wouldn't have bothered to work on it for the last ten years.",5,Life is a Dream Within a Dream,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,5199,"['known',

1304930,AN9J46667D80O,B002ZG980U,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[3, 4]","What a strange, fascinating, intelligent film this was. Deep, surreal, interesting and compelling, where perhaps its one fault was that it wasn't surreal enough. It's yet another extraordinary film from Christopher Nolan, who apparently can do no wrong, and it's well worth seeing at least a couple times.Inception tells the tale of a man (Leonardo DiCaprio), and his gang (headed up by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt and Lukas Haas, bringing together three former child stars), in what amounts to a highly interesting caper film. They've been assigned to infiltrate a man's dreams, and bring him new and strange thoughts about what he should do with the corporation he will inherit when his father dies. It sounds simple enough, and follows the basic formula all such works must follow (plenty of charts and diagrams, detailed plans, scenes showing the team being assembled), but as with so many great films, the genius is in the execution.In this case the execution takes us through several levels of a dream world intricately created by an architect (Ellen Page), and designed as a maze. The idea is that as the team goes through each level of the dream world will move closer and closer to the secrets held within the dreamer's brain. To say much more than that would give away too much of the story and the plot, and it's best to go into the film knowing as little about those elements as possible.The film is eye-candy at its finest. You see an entire city created out of a character's mind and watch as that city folds in on itself. You get to watch a fight in a corridor that spins as the characters go at it, and later you see the same character fighting in a zero-g environment so convincing you'll start to wonder if they rented to Vomit Comet for filming, ala Apollo 13.The direction here is also amazing, as Nolan is very much able to create several different stories taking place at several different points in time and space and manages to keep track of all of them. Even in a normal movie that's not easy to do, but in this one it shows some serious skills.Beyond that, it's very hard for me to really review this film without giving away major plot points.

This movie features actors - Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ellen Page, and many other great actors.Inception is directed, written, and produced by Christopher Nolan.  Christopher Nolan is best known for his Batman Trilogy, but this movie was made between ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Dark Knight Rises"" and shows his brilliance.  If you liked movies like The 12 Monkeys or Fight Club then you will like this movie.The movie plays with ideas of what reality is.  Is reality what we see when we are awake or is it what we see when we are asleep?  The movie features ideas like dreams within dreams, and like I said its trippy.  But I loved this movie and its the perfect movie to own on DVD, because you will want to watch this movie more than once.

When people appear in each other's dreams, they can extract data from the subconscious of another mind. People who know about this can erect defenses in their dreams against data extraction.The main character, Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a bounty hunter for dream extraction. Extraction is relatively well established, but his new employer, Saito, wants him to go further, to plant an idea (inception) into the mind of a business rival. Dom agrees to this and assembles a team of experts to create the dream world and playact with the mark, Fischer.One of the teammates, a young woman named Ariadne figures out that Dom has unresolved issues with his ""dead"" wife, Mal. He keeps seeing her in a dream. Every dreamer has a token to show them whether they are dreaming or in reality. Mal's is a spinning top that never topples. After a series of dreams within a dream, we are led to believe that Dom and his crew have returned to the real world.But Mal's question to Dom is, ""are you sure you're in the real world? or are you in a dream where men are hiring you for all these extractions and chasing you across continents?"" She wants him to come with her to where their real kids are. Dom appears to return home. He is welcomed by his father-in-law who was last seen in Paris. The children appear dreamlike, and he steps out to play with them. But before he does, he spins the top.

1304936,A1UOTG037037XY,B002ZG980U,Cleo,"[0, 6]","There is NO way that Ellen Page's character could have designed such an intricate dream and still have time to visit cute Joseph Gordon Levitt to ""discuss"" the work - they are adorable in Just the Two of Them scenes.So it must have been a  TEAM who designed the dream i.e. a conspiracy to GET Leo for murdering/violating Mallory, his Teacher's daughter and a BETTER designer than Leo. This movie is filled with snide jibes at Leo usually from Arthur or from Ellen Page but delivered unwittingly by the latter who is ALSO a better designer than Leo as deemed by his former Teacher.  The Hard Candy in Ellen Page is only allowed to peek out a few times in this film with lines like, ""is that why you need me to help you steal ideas?"" hahahaThat dar candy's pi'son, Leo, SPIT it out.The Main Character is stuck in a dream designed specifically to send him into oblivion whilst he continues to deny any wrongdoing i.e. he KILLED and violated Mallory and told an elaborate lie that she was suicidal because the two of them had returned from a deep dive into dream world.  Leo isn't capable of designing a 50-year worthy dream world.  So I THINK that not only is this world designed by his Teacher BUT that it's an entire team that did what Leo claimed to have done with Mallory and now Leo is refusing to design because of his ""grief"" but really he no longer has anyone to steal from so he is STUCK.  Totally immobilized and he has no idea how to move forward so the dream designers move him around insteadIt's interesting that Leo's ""acting"" comes across most authentically when he is raging at Arthur for making a mistake or grabbing Ariadne after designs a dream Paris superior to anything he could imagine.Remember that bubblegum song, ""Toy Soldiers"" by Martika?Well, you will learn nothing about the science of whatever this is from this film - this is just like Matrix where mental thought is expressed as toy soldiers versus toy soldiers and at the end of it, you should be able to walk away/wake up from it.  If we only think of it as Matrix-like combat in your dreams, then you shouldn't be worrying about just what exactly do the combatants of this dream within a dream represent.  I am not a fan of the Guy Pearce film with all the body tattoos that everyone else on the planet is gaga over so ... I am definitely not a fan of this film ALTHOUGH I did love Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow's on the other FOOT this time - or is it?), pretty Ellen Page ESPECIALLY when she shared the screen with her equally daintily-constructed Joseph Gordon Levitt and JGL is using a recognizable Keanu Reeves drawl in this film which is highly amusing given his later scenes.  HOWEVER, Titanic Boy's drawl is very strange and exacerbates is emotionally vacant line delivery.  I  keep thinking ""who is he imitating?"" whenever he spoke and I have no idea if he is mimicking Mark Walhberg's stuffed up nose style (too bad he doesn't have Marl Wahlberg or Matt Damon's career!).Just as with Gangs of New York, I was distracted from the storytelling by Leo's performance.  Marion Cotillard's FACE and subtle performance is fantastic in this film.  She seems to be in an entirely different relationship from Leonardo Di Caprio which might explain how their marriage ENDED and how the film ends.Whenever Leonardo Di Caprio explains inception, I get the feeling that he has no idea what he is talking about.  But Ellen Page's character seems to have a far better imagination than he does during her job interview.  THAT must be jarring.One weird thing which may indicate just who is the architect and who is the subject is how hard Leo yanks her arm during her job interview in dream state.But the absolutely best thing about this movie that despite his deep voice talking, Joseph Gordon Levitt ROCKS culminating in his Matrix meets Bruce Lee scene 1.5 hours into this film.  He also is the only one who pronounces Japanese guy's name as if it is Cantonese for Dead/Damned Island i.e. ""Say Doe"" with the proper Cantonese intonation no less whilst the Mal character's pronunciation of Dom sounds like Dumbf as in Dumbfkopf - Dom Cobb - which is also the name of a character in the director's first film but I like to think of Island of the Damned joined by Dumbfkopf in eternal Limbo which is why Arthur declars Dom lost when Ariadne says that Dom went after Saito instead of staying with Mal.  I like to think that once in a while Mal takes away from her busy life to visit Dompf in the Darkness of his mind.As for the bizarre soap opera romance of the girl who can't take rejection and the brave paramour having the guts to break away from his ""guilt"" at her demise, I call shenanigans!  This movie has nothing to do with romance (unless you count the tasty and tiny pieces of candy proffered by Joseph Gordon Levitt's Arthur to Ellen Page's Ariadne.  These two delicate boned actors really work in THIS film more so than I can imagine James Franco and Queen of Louisiana Evan Rachel Wood would have in the same roles.I think that aside that Cantonese audiences will also appreciate Dileep Rao's ""haHa bloody Ha"" and Peter Postlewaite's assessment of the death of his wife as ""there really being nothing more to say"" as being very dry Cantonese.

But in case I didn't make it clear enough, I hated this one.Inception is a science fiction film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger and Michael Caine, to name but a few. DiCaprio plays a type of spy who, with his partner Arthur, extract valuable information from the subconscious of their targets while they are asleep and dreaming. Cobb struggles with the circumstances of the death of his wife and not being able to be with his children.Cobb is given an assignment to use his skills to affect the subconscious of his enemy's son, Cillian Murphy, in order to sabotage his empire. In return, Cobb will be able to reunite with his kids, who he hasn't seen since his wife's death.The plot is interesting but the dreams within dreams within dreams were really really confusing to me.

This doesn't happen very often and immediately I knew that this was going to be something special. Other than the extraordinary special effects, the most impressive aspect of the film is that every person in the main cast is important to the storyline. Even though this clearly revolves around Cobb, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Eames (Tom Hardy), Ariadne (Ellen Page), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) are all given an appropriate amount of screen time and take full advantage of the time they're given. Every character has at least one moment where they have their time to shine, which is quite an accomplishment given how many people are in the cast. Even Saito (Ken Watanabe) and Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy) have their moments.The film is fabulously complex and there are so many things going on at once in the ladder half of the film that it results in the sci-fi actioner being incredibly difficult to spoil entirely without a longwinded explanation. I could tell you the last scene in the film right now and while it would make sense, things wouldn't fall into place or be entirely appreciated unless you knew everything leading up to that point.The film is superbly written. I'm a huge fan of films that make you think or are able to create something that at least feels like it's completely original and Inception accomplishes both of those things. On one hand, stealing anything you hold valuable from your dreams seems pretty far fetched. On the other, everyone dreams and everybody has secrets or at least something they keep locked away from most people. Imagining that those things are easily accessible to certain people because they've cracked the code on how to maneuver through your mental defenses is pretty intriguing and makes it seem easier to relate to since it's something everyone experiences.While everyone is waiting for the follow-up to The Dark Knight, Inception isn't the type of film that should be swept under the rug in the meantime. It's fantastically original, contains a spectacular cast where everyone involved delivers a strong performance, is wonderfully engrossing, and is definitely up to the high standard Christopher Nolan has set for himself with the other marvelous films on his resume. In typical Chris Nolan fashion, the ending is a huge tease but it's goosebump-worthy, completely fitting, and difficult to imagine the film ending any other way.

1304945,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B002ZG980U,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 3]","Director/writer Christopher Nolan has explored dark, obsessive characters in exemplary films like The Dark Knight.  In his most ambitious story yet (one that took ten years to develop), he designs a thoroughly complex story with concurrent narratives (think Godfather Part II or Intolerance) where (like his earliest film, Following, and his classic, Momento,) time and reality are bent and juxtaposed.  This is not light, escapist fare but a deep, convoluted story that engages the mind and heart, and few movies in recent years can be so challenging yet rewarding to its audience.A man named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) washes ashore and is taken by armed guards to an old man.  From there the film begins to jump in different settings or dream states.  Cobb is an expert at the art of `inception', the ability to enter people's subconscious to steal an idea or plant one.  A fugitive, he longs to be reunited with his two children and is constantly plagued by recurring visions of his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who becomes increasingly dangerous.  A wealthy Asian businessman, Saito (Ken Watanabe), makes a proposition to Cobb: extract a piece of information from a rival businessman (Cillian Murphy), and Cobb gets to return home to his kids.  Vowing this to be his last job, Cobb assembles his team of experts, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a newbie architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), a forger and impersonator, Earnes (Tom Hardy), and a drug chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao).  To infiltrate Fischer's mind, the team designs an elaborate set of dreams within dreams to effect a con game.  This compounds the risks and, as Cobb finds himself being harassed by a more menacing Mal, the team encounters last minute crises that force Cobb to make a desperate choice.  Can they get Fischer to reveal his secrets in time, and what of Cobb's personal obsession?The plot brings to mind the alternative realities of The Matrix, Dreamscape, and Altered States.  Like the magicians in Nolan's The Prestige, it is a slight of hand where much of the film's narrative plays like stream of consciousness.  It's about a lifetime of love that's experienced in mere flashes or an eternity, and despite the film's intricate machinations, its simple themes are the search for validation and love.  The film is also about the need of letting go and taking a leap of faith.  At times you wonder if any given scene is real or a dream, and that is the conceit of the film; for some, the dream IS the reality.The team concept is in keeping with Mission: Impossible and Oceans 11 (any version) as each member's expertise comes into play, and the deeper the team goes into the dreams, the greater the risks.  In one key sequence set in a snow mountain compound, there is an obvious homage to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and you wonder what wonders Nolan could work on the James Bond franchise!This `dream' cast works together very well and includes Nolan's repertory actors, Murphy and Caine.  DiCaprio (looking astonishingly like Nolan) does an excellent job as the tortured soul with a dark secret.  Cotillard is hauntingly beautiful as Cobb's wife while the younger Page is adorable as the bright architect who also serves as Cobb's moral compass when he begins to falter and have self doubts.The film's technical accomplishments are outstanding, and although the special effects are terrific in depicting the mind bending scenery, the live action sets and stunt work (with Levitt doing some remarkable acrobatics) are even more impressive in depicting mixed gravity where people float or walk on walls and ceilings.  In a masterful blend of film editing, the dream sequences shuttle back and forth, and time is slowed to a crawl in one instance, and given years in another.  Hans Zimmer's relentless, minimalist score is a particularly noteworthy achievement of mood and dramatic pacing.This is not a perfect film, and (at two and one-half hours) there are moments where you think Nolan could have explored more of his subjects.  A director like Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard might have emotionally milked certain scenes for all they are worth, and it is because of that, we expect a bit more connection and feelings.  Like most of Nolan's films, the brooding characters and situations are almost entirely devoid of humor or any lighthearted tone which brings to mind any number of Stanley Kubrick films.  While some may find the ending a bit too neat or perhaps too open ended, it is left to the audience to decide how to interpret the meaning of the finale.  Yet these are minor quibbles for grand, pure cinematic experience.  Nolan has created something so special that it engages the mind. How dare he?With Inception, Christopher Nolan is most certainly one of the best film directors.  His previous masterpiece, The Dark Knight, should have been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar.  Come to think of it, that very film helped change the Oscar rules to expand from five to ten nominees so that gems like Inception are not left out.  It won't be.  Do take this wild ride, and you'll find that you are obsessed with its mystery and beauty and repeating the journey again and again.",5,INCEPTION Is a Dream Come True,1279843200,"07 23,

But now, he and his team have been hired for a different kind of job: placing an idea within a person's head.  Inception.  Can it even be done?  Has Cobb done it before?  And what are the consequences of such a difficult action?It caused quite a stir, as pretty much any Chris Nolan film is bound to do nowadays (you can't direct the best superhero movie of all time and not expect people to riot over your work).  INCEPTION doesn't live up to all of the hype...but it lives up to most of it. (And it's better on the second viewing, too. the first time I saw it in theaters, I was mildly impressed.  The second time, I was awed.)  Leo DiCaprio turns in another rock-solid performance; not his best, but a deep and complex turn for him.  Ellen Page is so-so; she's done better, but her presence alone adds an extra bit of umpf to the film.  Marion Cotillard is truly sexy AND scary (a rare combination for an actress to pull off); Tom Hardy shines; Tom Berenger is just there, but we like him there, so it's okay; Cillian Murphy is great as always.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the standout of the cast; he's slick and funny, and one has to wonder how it would've been if he'd been cast as Cobb (not that DiCaprio isn't great).  Nolan's script and directing are top-notch; there are some logical flaws, but surprisingly nothing that brings the movie down too much.

1304955,A2XMBWQL0LGNJD,B002ZG980U,Dave Cordes,"[5, 7]","Every generation has at least one great visionary director whose creative genius transcends their visual craft in a way that defies the conventional norm and is revered by critics and audiences for their originality and brilliance.  Christopher Nolan is, without doubt, this generation's Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa, or Orson Welles and will long be remembered among that pantheon as one of the greatest film directors of all time.Inception is the movie thatThe Matrixwanted to be but wasn't and only dreams that it could have been while it was more preoccupied making itself look cool with science fiction technology and special effects, it merely stands upon the precipice of the elaborate canvas of storytelling genius that Nolan presents us here with Inception's intricately complex and labyrinthian narrative as he so masterfully demonstrated inMemento(2000) that relies upon virtually no science fiction technology at all, simply the dreams and imagination of its narrative construct.  There is never a dull moment as the viewer's mind is forced to keep up with the expository action racing along like a proverbial freight train.  The special effects are relatively seamless and exist only to support the rich, complicated framework of the story rather than distract from it with gratuitous explosions and an overindulgence of CGI that dominate the morose offerings of modern summer movie blockbusters.  Nolan's visual scope and palette are vast and epic but grounded in a believable and conventional reality, an illusion every bit as effective as the slight-of-hand deception ofThe Prestigethat will leave the viewer questioning what reality really is and which level of reality they are watching long after the film has ended.There are plenty of nods and send-ups to Nolan's favorite films and their influences are evident throughout, the most obvious of which beingBlade Runnerwhich Nolan is quoted as his biggest inspiration and alsoOn Her Majesty's Secret Servicewhich he cited as his favorite James Bond film.  For my money, they should just hand the keys to the Bond franchise over to Nolan right now and let him re-invigorate it with the same sophistication and panache that he brought to the Batman franchise withBatman BeginsandThe Dark Knight.  Tom Hardy already proved his theatrical range as a serious performer with his breakout performance asBronson(2009) and delivers an exceptional supporting performance as Eames mixing sly wit with a focused intensity that would be perfect to see him bringing to the role of future James Bond.Although I've never really cared much for Leonardo DiCaprio as a leading actor and have always regarded him as that ""kid"" from Titanic but I was completely taken by his emotionally intense performance as Cobb.  Nolan has a knack for casting only the best actors of the highest caliber for his roles and here Leo proves that he is more than a capable leading actor of his generation.  Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine once again bring an heir of class and benediction to their supporting roles as they had done previously in Batman Begins.Hanz Zimmer's intense score forInceptionis extraordinary delivering a lucid electronic ambiance that is both as ethereal as it is urgent, even darker and more melancholy than his score forThe Dark Knight (2 CD Special Edition).  Zimmer composes an auditory dreamscape that compliments the visual experience of the film by implanting its haunting melody in your mind and staying with you long after you've left the theater.Summer 2010 was looking pretty bleak until Nolan came along and rescued it much like he did in 2008 with The Dark Knight.  All my fears and doubts about how he was going to top that with the third Batman film have easily been subdued.  I have no doubt in my mind that he will deliver a spectacular finale to his chorus of Batman films with the same sophistication as he has demonstrated in Inception.  The Dark Knight is in good hands.  Now, just let him have the keys to the Astin Martin and let him write his own ticket.  Nolan is the real architect of our dreams.",5,A flawlessly designed construct of cinematic architecture,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,4131,"['generation', 'least', 'one', 'great', 'visionary', 'director', 'creative', 'genius', 'visual', 'craft', 'way', 'conventional', 'norm', 'revered', 'critics', 'audiences', 'originality', 'brilliance', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'doubt', 'generation', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'will', 'long', 'be', 'remembered', 'pantheon', 'one', 'greatest', 'film', 'directors', 'time.Inception', 'movie', 'thatThe', 'Matrixwanted', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'more', 'preoccupied', 'making', 'look', 'cool', 'science', 'fiction', 'technology', 'special', 'effects', 'merely', 'precipice', 'elaborate', 'canvas', 'storytelling', 'genius', 'Nolan', 'here', 'Inception', 'intricately', 'complex', 'labyrinthian', 'narrative', 'so', 'masterfully', 'demonstrated', 'inMemento', '2000', 'virtually', 'science', 'fiction', 'technology', 'simply', 'dreams', 'imagination', 'narrative', 'construct', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'viewer', 'mind', 'forced', 'keep', 'up', 'expository', 'action', 'racing', 'along', 'proverbial', 'freight', 'train', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'relatively', 'seamless', 'only', 'support', 'rich', 'complicated', 'framework', 'story', 'rather', 'distract', 'gratuitous', 'explosions', 'overindulgence', 'CGI', 'dominate', 'morose', 'offerings', 'modern', 'summer', 'movie', 'blockbusters', 'Nolan', 'visual', 'scope', 'palette', 'are', 'vast', 'epic', 'grounded', 'believable', 'conventional', 'reality', 'illusion', 'bit', 'as', 'effective', 'slight-of-hand', 'deception', 'ofThe', 'Prestigethat', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'questioning', 'what', 'reality', 'really', 'level', 'reality', 'are', 'watching', 'long', 'film', 'ended.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'nods', 'send-ups', 'Nolan', 'favorite', 'films', 'influences', 'are', 'evident', 'most', 'obvious', 'beingBlade', 'Runnerwhich', 'Nolan', 'quoted', 'biggest', 'inspiration', 'alsoOn', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Servicewhich', 'cited', 'favorite', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'money', 'should', 'just', 'hand', 'keys', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'Nolan', 'right', 'now', 'let', 're-invigorate', 'same', 'sophistication', 'panache', 'brought', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'withBatman', 'BeginsandThe', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'already', 'proved', 'theatrical', 'range', 'serious', 'performer', 'breakout', 'performance', 'asBronson', '2009', 'exceptional', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Eames', 'mixing', 'sly', 'wit', 'focused', 'intensity', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'see', 'bringing', 'role', 'future', 'James', 'Bond.Although', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'much', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'leading', 'actor', 'have', 'always', 'regarded', 'kid', 'Titanic', 'was', 'completely', 'taken', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'performance', 'Cobb', 'Nolan', 'knack', 'casting', 'only', 'best', 'actors', 'highest', 'caliber', 'roles', 'here', 'Leo', 'more', 'capable', 'leading', 'actor', 'generation', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'once', 'again', 'bring', 'heir', 'class', 'benediction', 'supporting', 'roles', 'had', 'done', 'previously', 'Batman', 'Begins.Hanz', 'Zimmer', 'intense', 'score', 'forInceptionis', 'extraordinary', 'delivering', 'lucid', 'electronic', 'ambiance', 'as', 'ethereal', 'urgent', 'even', 'darker', 'more', 'melancholy', 'score', 'forThe', 'Dark', 'Knight', '2', 'CD', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Zimmer', 'auditory', 'dreamscape', 'visual', 'experience', 'film', 'implanting', 'haunting', 'melody', 'mind', 'staying', 'long', ""'ve"", 'left', 'theater.Summer', '2010', 'was', 'looking', 'pretty', 'bleak', 'Nolan', 'came', 'along', 'rescued', 'much', 'did', '2008', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'fears', 'doubts', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'top', 'third', 'Batman', 'film', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'subdued', 'have', 'doubt', 'mind', 'will', 'deliver', 'spectacular', 'finale', 'chorus', 'Batman', 'films', 'same', 'sophistication', 'demonstrated', 'Inception', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'good', 'hands', 'Now', 'just', 'let', 'have', 'keys', 'Astin', 'Martin', 'let', 'write', 'own', 'ticket', 'Nolan', 'real', 'architect', 'dreams']",N/A

1304958,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B002ZG980U,Davewise,"[1, 2]","Christopher Nolan once again brings us a movie with special effects to dazzle us and brilliant writing to make us think. This is a movie which bears repeat viewings because some of its ideas and plot devices can be complex. You definitely want to watch it when you're prepared to do at least some thinking - it isn't one of those ""turn off your brain"" and be entertained action movies (different movies for different moods). There is a lot to like here, with an excellent cast, wonderful cinematography, some interesting twists, and a core that will make you feel for some of the characters.Cobb (DiCaprio) is an expert at getting into people's minds via their dreams and stealing information. Using a special device, he and some other specialists kidnap and drug the target individual, and then draw them into a dream world of their creation. In the dream they interact with the person and get them to reveal their secrets. All the time, the person's subconscious takes the form of people in the dream world who try to attack the invaders. If any of them die in the dream, they wake up. For some assignments, they actually create a dream within the dream in order to more completely disorient the person and have a better chance of stealing the information. There is also the risk of falling into limbo though, a world created by whoever gets trapped there and where time goes on and on. Limbo can be enticing to some because you have complete control over the world around you. The process of knowingly going into these dreams and sometimes seeing familiar places can cause one to question reality. This is where the movie starts to make you think.Although he gets paid to do this and almost certainly enjoys his work to some degree, what Cobb wants most in life is simply to be able to see his children. Wanted for the murder of his wife Mal - of which he is innocent - Cobb is constantly on the run and cannot return to the U.S. to even see his children. During one of his assignments, he is presented with an offer he can't refuse - plant an idea into someone's mind and a call will be made to clear up the warrant for his arrest. Inception - planting an idea into someone's mind - is much more difficult than stealing information from someone's mind so Cobb puts together a team of experts to accomplish this. One member of the team, Ariadne (Ellen Page), notices that Cobb has some guilt issues which interferes with his ability to perform and even think straight at times. Ariadne pursues it to the point where she finds out what really happened to Mal. This is where the movie starts to make you feel for the characters.The movie includes some great effects sequences and action scenes, including some where Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is tumbling around the walls of a hotel (with stunts performed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt himself). Filmed on location in cities around the world such as Paris and Tangiers, the cinematography looks amazing both in the real world and in the dreams. A couple of structural devices used by the dream designers look like they're straight out of a M.C. Escher painting.I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a gorgeous science fiction movie which will also make you think. The dreams within dreams plot might get confusing at times, but there is an emotional core which doesn't get lost.",5,"Great combination of intelligence, heart, and effects",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,3343,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'dazzle', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'make', 'think', 'movie', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'ideas', 'plot', 'devices', 'can', 'be', 'complex', 'definitely', 'want', 'watch', 'when', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'do', 'least', 'thinking', ""n't"", 'one', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'be', 'entertained', 'action', 'movies', 'different', 'movies', 'different', 'moods', 'lot', 'here', 'excellent', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'interesting', 'twists', 'core', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'characters.Cobb', 'DiCaprio', 'expert', 'getting', 'people', 'minds', 'dreams', 'stealing', 'information', 'Using', 'special', 'device', 'other', 'specialists', 'kidnap', 'drug', 'target', 'individual', 'then', 'draw', 'dream', 'world', 'creation', 'dream', 'interact', 'person', 'get', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'time', 'person', 'subconscious', 'form', 'people', 'dream', 'world', 'who', 'try', 'attack', 'invaders', 'die', 'dream', 'wake', 'up', 'assignments', 'actually', 'create', 'dream', 'dream', 'order', 'more', 'completely', 'disorient', 'person', 'have', 'better', 'chance', 'stealing', 'information', 'also', 'risk', 'falling', 'limbo', 'world', 'created', 'whoever', 'trapped', 'where', 'time', 'Limbo', 'can', 'be', 'enticing', 'have', 'complete', 'control', 'world', 'process', 'knowingly', 'going', 'dreams', 'sometimes', 'seeing', 'familiar', 'places', 'can', 'cause', 'one', 'question', 'reality', 'where', 'movie', 'make', 'paid', 'do', 'almost', 'certainly', 'work', 'degree', 'what', 'Cobb', 'most', 'life', 'simply', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'children', 'Wanted', 'murder', 'wife', 'Mal', 'innocent', 'Cobb', 'constantly', 'run', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'U.S.', 'even', 'see', 'children', 'one', 'assignments', 'presented', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'plant', 'idea', 'someone', 'mind', 'call', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'clear', 'up', 'warrant', 'arrest', 'Inception', 'planting', 'idea', 'someone', 'mind', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'stealing', 'information', 'someone', 'mind', 'so', 'Cobb', 'together', 'team', 'experts', 'accomplish', 'One', 'member', 'team', 'Ariadne', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Cobb', 'guilt', 'issues', 'ability', 'perform', 'even', 'think', 'straight', 'times', 'Ariadne', 'point', 'where', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Mal', 'where', 'movie', 'make', 'feel', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'great', 'effects', 'sequences', 'action', 'scenes', 'including', 'where', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'character', 'tumbling', 'walls', 'hotel', 'stunts', 'performed', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Filmed', 'location', 'cities', 'world', 'such', 'Paris', 'Tangiers', 'cinematography', 'amazing', 'real', 'world', 'dreams', 'couple', 'structural', 'devices', 'used', 'dream', 'designers', 'look', ""'re"", 'straight', 'M.C', 'Escher', 'painting.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'gorgeous', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'think', 'dreams', 'dreams', 'plot', 'might', 'get', 'confusing', 'times', 'emotional', 'core', ""n't"", 'get', 'lost']",N/A

This involves a mind-bending scheme that involves dreams within dreams and requires the participants to risk spending a subjective eternity in the limbo of the subconscious.I'm looking forward to Christopher Nolan's next Batman movie, but after this film, I kind of wish he wasn't wedded to that franchise and was instead free to create his next movie out of whole cloth.  He is one of the most impressive visionaries working in film today.

1304964,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B002ZG980U,David R. Eastwood,"[3, 3]","One of the things that attracts some people to science fiction (and repels others) is that its stories are usually based on ""WHAT IF--?"" premises that are NOT parts of our ""normal reality."" Much early ""sci-fi"" or ""SF"" was disparaged as crap because the premises overwhelmed both the story arcs and the characters--and the writing also was often very poor. In recent decades, a better balance has been found by hundreds of authors and dozens film makers, and both the TERMINATOR series and ALIEN series, for instance, are now highly respected classics.INCEPTION, I felt, is better than average but has at least three weaknesses--no, make that four--no, five. For one thing, the story arc is trite and its ending derivative (think Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL, 1985). For another, at its own ""inception"" we viewers are given material that coyly/pseudo-artfully prefigures some ending scenes but does not logically hold up (Ken Watanabe as an old man in BOTH spots). Thirdly, very often the exposition of the ""What If--?"" is clunkier than 20 speed bumps in a new housing development--the action grinds to a halt while one ""expert"" explains some new aspect of Dream Management 101 to another ""expert,"" just so we viewers can eavesdrop and become informed. Fourthly, we really are NOT made to care much either way about the success or failure of the ""mission"" (a kind of caper involving a sub-category of industrial espionage) NOR about the happiness or misery of the main character, a somewhat charmless widower who wants to live with his young children (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). And the back-stories of the other characters are non-existent, so of course we don't care either way about them. And fifthly, the whole notion of creating the ""inception"" of an idea in a business rival's head rests on a shakier foundation than trickle-down economics: any kernel of an idea put into anyone's brain can sprout and grow in any of 57-million directions--NOT just the one narrow direction that is desired by the paymaster (played by Ken Watanabe).On the PLUS side--this film has fast-action and good CGI special effects in many places. It IS a decent mind-game with four levels of action that flash round-&-round in kaleidoscopic fashion--and then go to a fifth level. It IS way more mature in its psychology than James Cameron's AVATAR; it makes much more sense than the MATRIX series; and it's far, far, FAR superior in every respect to M. Night Shyamalan's THE LAST AIRBENDER.But I would still sooner rewatch STRANGER THAN FICTION (Will Ferrell, Helen Mirren, Dustin Hoffman). The only reason I put INCEPTION back into my DVD player the next day and sped past scene after scene to the end again--was to satisfy my curiosity--as to how LONG it ran. SPOILER ALERT: the version I watched ran 2:20:47--which is more than I'd have cared to sit in a theater, especially if I had bought a large cola.",4,"A THREE-CARD MONTE MIND-GAME--NO, MAKE THAT FOUR-CARD MONTE--NO, FIVE",1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,2883,"['One', 'things', 'people', 'science', 'fiction', 'others', 'stories', 'are', 'usually', 'based', 'WHAT', 'IF', 'are', 'NOT', 'parts', 'normal', 'reality', 'Much', 'early', 'sci-fi', 'SF', 'was', 'disparaged', 'crap', 'premises', 'overwhelmed', 'story', 'arcs', 'characters', 'writing', 'also', 'was', 'often', 'very', 'poor', 'recent', 'decades', 'better', 'balance', 'been', 'found', 'hundreds', 'authors', 'dozens', 'film', 'makers', 'TERMINATOR', 'series', 'ALIEN', 'series', 'instance', 'are', 'now', 'highly', 'respected', 'classics.INCEPTION', 'felt', 'better', 'average', 'least', 'three', 'weaknesses', 'make', 'four', 'five', 'one', 'thing', 'story', 'arc', 'trite', 'ending', 'derivative', 'think', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'BRAZIL', '1985', 'own', 'inception', 'viewers', 'are', 'given', 'material', 'coyly/pseudo-artfully', 'prefigures', 'ending', 'scenes', 'not', 'logically', 'hold', 'up', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'old', 'man', 'BOTH', 'spots', 'Thirdly', 'very', 'often', 'exposition', 'What', 'clunkier', '20', 'speed', 'bumps', 'new', 'housing', 'development', 'action', 'halt', 'one', 'expert', 'new', 'aspect', 'Dream', 'Management', '101', 'expert', 'just', 'viewers', 'can', 'eavesdrop', 'become', 'informed', 'Fourthly', 'really', 'are', 'NOT', 'made', 'care', 'much', 'way', 'success', 'failure', 'mission', 'kind', 'caper', 'involving', 'sub-category', 'industrial', 'espionage', 'happiness', 'misery', 'main', 'character', 'somewhat', 'charmless', 'widower', 'who', 'live', 'young', 'children', 'played', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'back-stories', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'non-existent', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'way', 'fifthly', 'whole', 'notion', 'creating', 'inception', 'idea', 'business', 'rival', 'head', 'shakier', 'foundation', 'trickle-down', 'economics', 'kernel', 'idea', 'put', 'anyone', 'brain', 'can', 'sprout', 'grow', '57-million', 'directions', 'NOT', 'just', 'one', 'narrow', 'direction', 'desired', 'paymaster', 'played', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', '.On', 'PLUS', 'side', 'film', 'fast-action', 'good', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'many', 'places', 'decent', 'mind-game', 'four', 'levels', 'action', 'round-', '-round', 'kaleidoscopic', 'fashion', 'then', 'go', 'fifth', 'level', 'way', 'more', 'mature', 'psychology', 'James', 'Cameron', 'AVATAR', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'MATRIX', 'series', 'far', 'far', 'FAR', 'respect', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'THE', 'LAST', 'AIRBENDER.But', 'would', 'still', 'sooner', 'rewatch', 'STRANGER', 'THAN', 'FICTION', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'only', 'reason', 'put', 'INCEPTION', 'back', 'DVD', 'player', 'next', 'day', 'sped', 'past', 'scene', 'scene', 'end', 'again', 'was', 'satisfy', 'curiosity', 'how', 'LONG', 'ran', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'version', 'watched', 'ran', '2:20:47', 'more', ""'d"", 'have', 'cared', 'sit', 'theater', 'especially', 'had', 'bought', 'large', 'cola']",N/A

It's suppose make you question and beg the fabric of the world we live in, that we perceive, and to question if your current life is a dream. Plaster Inception with many special effects and explosions, this flick is bound to win many awards. It has that blockbuster type of production and feel to it.But these factors failed for the following reasons: 1) The storyline is too confusion, the ""who, what, where, and when"" is not obvious; 2) Too many dream sequences and levels down; 3) Suffers from poor character development (reminds me of Italian Job); 4) That portable dream machine device and wiring is a joke; and 5) The unconventional running length of 2  hrs is overwhelmingly a dragging work still in progress of editing.A movie's storyline should contain all the elements/points needed for a smooth understanding. Only later when I read about the synopsis did I connect the dots. But any movie should not require ""homework"" but should appeal to ""average Joe"" movie goers. A great movie is one that leaves you still thinking days later. I was lost here after 20 min.This movie could easily be 5 star by doing the following: 1) Don't hide the concepts, but make the driving force the story itself, and adventurous, for example classics like Star Wars, or Wizard of Oz. 2) Make dreams something we can ALL relate to (more realistic) by dumping the multi-layering aspect.  One level down is good enough.  3) Cut out some useless scenes, make it 1  hrs, but keep the special effects.As far as the product, 3 discs are encased in a standard sized blu ray case to save space. On the cover slip (a 3D hologram, though this is not a 3D movie) says, ""digital copy."" This product should NOT advertise ""digital copy"" (misleading), since it's actually ""digital download."" Like many other reviewers here, I was disappointed to find a digital copy missing from my purchase. Likewise, anyone would be disappointed too, if the blu ray disc were missing inside the case, but instead, a paper containing instructions on how to download the movie itself online. Worse yet, there's an expiration date (May 6, 2011) on the download.Inception had too much hype and expectations leading to letdown. Concept is nothing new here.

Confusing details will be clarified.  I think the movie was purposely made to mystify you at first, only to let the wow factor discharge with subsequent viewings.  I'm sure writer/director Christopher Nolan craftily planned this, intentionally placing scenes in the beginning left unexplained, knowing that inquisitive diehards will take a revelation the next time around.PLOT & CONCEPT OF THE MOVIEThe storyline is actually pretty simple.  Don't let that confuse you.  I will not inundate you with the plot details, as you'll read it elsewhere for easy explanation.  Actually, I'll place the plain framework synopsis in the comment entry section.  The what, who, why, when, how will be clarified.  Otherwise, let me go into the meat of this movie.Depending on how you view it, the concept of the movie as intended by the author C. Nolan is a bit more challenging, which my review here will address.  The premise of the movie is not that obvious, but when understood in the context of psychology, is quite deep.  And the significance of this movie's meaning is philosophical and the psyche blowing implications are staggeringly mind boggling as the concept are a mouthful to take in.  Hopefully I'll bridge some gap here.ONLY IN HOLLYWOOD, WITH AN INGENIOUS THINKER, WRITER, AND DIRECTOR.Though unique and original in its own way, Inception does follow suit with the other analogous mind-boggling concept movies that my further review is in allusion to encompass et al., not limiting to Inception.  That is to say my references to these mind twisting ambition are likewise, deduced aspiration similar in genre to movies/TV of such, The Matrix, Vanilla Sky, Truman Show, Tru Calling (TV), and The Adjustment Bureau (TBA, March 4th release).You can see there's a multitude of mind twisting movies.  They're nothing new.  They are to show what could be beyond, outside the box, which you never notice on your daily life's routine basis.  Like nothing can substitute the thrill of a coaster ride, it does take the creation by means of Hollywood movies and a distinctive writer/director to visually portray that outer (or inner) world beyond your perception, and likewise important, an audience who's equally open to interpret such ideas with the current methodology understanding process of science, philosophy, and existentialism.The following concepts or conclusion can be ascertained from the information provided by the story line and that the writer Nolan would like to audience to establish.  That dreams are as authentic as reality to the point for you to question, like Cobb & Mal did, if your current awaken reality state is actually a dream state?  And, as I will also describe how Inception is precisely and surprisingly consistent with the way we humans dream.  In addition, the concepts in Inception are shocking consistent w/ physics, philosophy, ideology, and theology.  (Don't assume Nolan didn't do his homework.  He warps all the bases for your mind). By consistent, I mean the following:METAPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONSIt is readily taken for granted; your thinking process is independent.  But if there's an external controller, how would you ever know it right?INCEPTOR / INCEPTEEHence, the first and principal foremost, insight is that the inceptee (the one being incepted, in this case Robert Fischer, the corporate heir and the target of Leonardo DiCaprio's dreamscape heist, played by Cillian Murphy), never realizes it.  By the same token, like Fischer, we are probably subjected to inception without a clue.  Nolan is showing that in the real world, the inceptee could be anyone, including you.In Vanilla Sky, David Aames (Tom Cruise) was trapped in a simulation unaware, and evidently tries vehemently to break away.  Matrix ccomputer programmer Thomas A. Anderson (Keanu Reeves) character is encased in the Matrix.  Tru calling TV where we never perceive the outer framework of our normal day to day perception, but Tru Davies (Eliza Dushku) could in that other dimension.  Likewise, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) never realized he was being watched by thousands.  In addition, Truman Show's architect designed the set and entire city and sky, stars, was framed, and what is believed by Truman, the heavens as well.  The Adjustment Bureau, {taken from the trailer, ""Life is a series of events.  This man (Matt Damon).  This glance.  The moments all happen according to plan.  This plan, monitored by the bureau who run the world, behind the curtain you never knew existed.""}Now the inception schemes in the movies Inception and Vanilla Sky may not be as quickly revealed compared to as in Matrix or Truman Show, or as obvious as in Tru Calling.  That's what leaves the art, mystery, attention focus span, and suspense more daunting in Inception.  See, you have to figure it out yourself before the answer to the puzzle is revealed, or before you're confused, or have to re-watch it again.CONTROLLERS / CONTROLEE-The external controllers are as follows:-Inception: Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his dream team, including Ariadne (Ellen Page), a young student architect tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes.-Truman Show: the entire cast (except Truman), including Christof (Ed Harris), the creator AKA ""god.""-Matrix: it's Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the Matrix itself.-Vanilla Sky, it's an unnamed man (Noah Taylor), and the court psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell).-Tru Calling: it's Tru Davies (Eliza Dushku), and an unknown force (who gave Tru her calling ability).  Also, her father Richard Davies (Cotter Smith), and Jack Harper (Jason Priestley) as the counterintuitive force.-The Adjustment Bureau: the adjustment bureau team.The controllee are as follows:-Inception: it's Robert Fischer.-Truman Show: it's Truman Burbank.-Matrix: it's Keanu Reeves.-Vanilla Sky: it's Tom Cruise.-Tru Calling: it's those saying, ""Help me!""  And in your life, well, you!-The Adjustment Bureau: David (Matt Damon).Lets look at some scientific data on how this may be true this moment, how inception and movies like these are in fact very consistent w/ pure science.Please check back.

1304974,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,B002ZG980U,Derek,"[2, 2]","To begin, I have been waiting for this film since Christopher Nolan announced it. All films I have seen from him are amazing and I usually have high expectations for him. AfterThe Dark Knight, I expected a great deal from this film. The previews only helped to flame the fire. It is also a common thing for me that when people talk about how wonderful a film is, I walk into the theaters overly-hyped and usually walk out disappointed. Case-in-point:Avatar. I was beginning to get over-hyped with this film since people couldn't stop talking about it and everyone loved it.Now, isn't it wonderful when you can get over-hyped and walk into a movie with sky-rocketing expectations and still come out completely satisfied?Yes, it's wonderful! And yes, that happened with this movie!The movie follows a team of mind-navigators that specialize in stealing secrets. They find that they may be well in over their heads when they accept the job of performing an inception,  a task where they must plant an idea so deep in someone's mind that the person must believe that it is their own idea.This movie was amazing! The story was original and thought-provoking, the graphics were incredible, the acting was very good, the music was awesome, and the ending was perfect! I know a lot of people were upset with the ending, but I loved it! The end! This movie was awesome! My favorite movie of all time, and that is a hard bar to reach! Thank the heavens we have Christopher Nolan around to create astounding movies and never leave us disappointed! And just a hint for Hollywood, he didn't have to do it with all the sex and the cussing and the gore that you think is oh-so-necessary!Okay, this is the end for reals.But the movie was awesome.

When I saw the trailers for Inception, I didn't know what to expect but when I saw it the day it premiered I was completely blown away. So blown away that I watch it again in theaters. 2010 was a year full of dissapointments (especially in the summer) and Inception was the only live-action film that truly delivered. It presents a completely original complex idea of how dreams work that in other less talented hands would have been a mess but in Nolan's hands is a masterpiece. Add amazing special effects, a talented cast and a fantastic score provided by Hans Zimmer and you have one of the best movies ever. I've seen some good movies this year like The Social Network, Black Swan and others and while they are really good, Inception is the best and by far is my year's favorite (alongside Toy Story 3).Inception in Blu-Ray looks fantastic. There is really good detail with no grain, artifacts or any other bad thing that could plague the picture. Even more impressive is the sound, with a dts-hd 5.1, Inception really rocks the house.You have a handful of bonus material like some deleted scenes, trailers and most exciting the Extraction-Mode viewing experience which dissects many scenes of the film and the crew discusses how they achieved this amazing scenes.A DVD/Digital Copy disc is also offered.Inception is a clever, well-constructed film that deserves every praise that it got.

I was anticipating great things.Didn't see, hear or feel them.The plot was very hard to follow, but, once I'd watched a while, I didn't much care anymore, and the whole thing became incomprehensible.Right from the start, the film had no context; the people on the screen seemed connected to no one and nothing. They were just there for no appreciable reason. They hardly seemed connected to each other.The dialogue was jejune - what there was of it - mostly there were declamations. The acting was either bad or missing - I was especially sorry to see the talents of Joseph Gordon-Leavitt and Marion Cotillard utterly wasted.Leonardo DeCaprio is in a league of his own. It's not that he can't act - though his skills are rudimentary - he just doesn't. He seems to have one facial expression for most of the movie, although sometimes he squints. Since his is the only character dealt with at length and since he is opaque, the film lacks any emotional touchstone.There is a lot of action, although it doesn't add up to much, perhaps because it is so random; causality is missing. Credibility is stretched until it twangs in your face - if what they all are doing is so delicate, why are they actually in a van careening around a city instead of in some quiet apartment? (Silly - quiet apartments don't plunge off of bridges.)The vaunted special effects - I had seen virtually all of them in the trailers for the film, and, since there seemed to be no point to any of them and since they passed by rather quickly, I found them unimpressive.The ending is supposed to be enigmatic - it is, but it is also predictable.Moral of this story: Watch things like this on DVD - it's easier to turn them off than to struggle through a row of rapt people to escape.",1,Maybe I'm Getting Stupid,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,1831,"['Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.Inception', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'movies', '2010', 'was', 'anticipating', 'great', 'things.Did', ""n't"", 'see', 'hear', 'feel', 'them.The', 'plot', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'follow', 'once', ""'d"", 'watched', 'while', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'anymore', 'whole', 'thing', 'became', 'incomprehensible.Right', 'start', 'film', 'had', 'context', 'people', 'screen', 'seemed', 'connected', 'one', 'nothing', 'were', 'just', 'there', 'appreciable', 'reason', 'hardly', 'seemed', 'connected', 'other.The', 'dialogue', 'was', 'jejune', 'what', 'was', 'mostly', 'were', 'declamations', 'acting', 'was', 'either', 'bad', 'missing', 'was', 'especially', 'sorry', 'see', 'talents', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Leavitt', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'utterly', 'wasted.Leonardo', 'DeCaprio', 'league', 'own', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'skills', 'are', 'rudimentary', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'facial', 'expression', 'most', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'only', 'character', 'dealt', 'length', 'opaque', 'film', 'emotional', 'touchstone.There', 'lot', 'action', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'perhaps', 'so', 'random', 'causality', 'missing', 'Credibility', 'stretched', 'face', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'so', 'delicate', 'why', 'are', 'actually', 'van', 'careening', 'city', 'instead', 'quiet', 'apartment', 'Silly', 'quiet', 'apartments', 'do', ""n't"", 'plunge', 'bridges', 'vaunted', 'special', 'effects', 'had', 'seen', 'virtually', 'trailers', 'film', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'point', 'passed', 'rather', 'quickly', 'found', 'unimpressive.The', 'ending', 'supposed', 'be', 'enigmatic', 'also', 'predictable.Moral', 'story', 'Watch', 'things', 'DVD', 'easier', 'turn', 'off', 'struggle', 'row', 'rapt', 'people', 'escape']",N/A

Nolan clearly took his time with this script, a full eight years in the making, and it bears gorgeous fruit in the form of a rich, bright analysis of lucid dreams, shared consciousness and the very roots of influence in an individual psyche. Those are some pretty heavy concepts to just toss around in a Hollywood blockbuster, but through careful elaboration and a few very stylish test cases, it manages to efficiently explain the ground rules and get on to telling the story without bucking the casuals or alienating the intellectuals. With all sorts of hidden truths, cleverly-masked winks and subtle hints at all sorts of deeper meanings, there's also much more here than can be absorbed in a single viewing. Although the run time falls well north of two hours, the groundwork is so enveloping - and the plot so fast-paced - that the minutes just rip by without any regard for the clock on your wall.

What makes the film great are the strong performances by Leo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy,Marion Cotillard  Ellen Page, Dileep Rao and Ken Watanabe and the spectacular visuals. DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a master extractor - a specialist in stealing information from target's dreams. Cobb assembles a team in order to perform inception - influenced inspiration on a subconscious level - so that he can have criminal charges placed against him lifted and return home to his family.

1304995,A6LUXI8I8BU6P,B002ZG980U,"D Strick ""Entertainment D""","[2, 3]","Inception is an interesting movie but might not be everyone's cup of tea.  Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a man who specializes in dream extractions (think corporate espionage) - going into a shared dream state using a military derived technique with a team and a subject to extract a piece of information from that subject's subconscious mind.  This can sometimes involve going into a dream within a dream (or more).Much was made of the complexities of this movie and indeed it is complex but for a generation growing up watching Matrix movies (especially the latter two) this is positively straight forward - and that's not a bad thing.  This is helped by Cobb's new dream architect (played by Ellen Page) who is also new to this world and to whom he explains the rules of the dream world (and thereby us - something not as well done in the Matrix flicks).  In addition to these dream rules there are the complexities of Cobb himself and the guilt he feels over the tragedy of his wife and kids and how this affects his missions.  And the complexities of the new job - to plant an idea into the mind (this process is called inception) of a young business tycoon who has a strained relationship with his dying father.  So yes it is complex but at no time did I feel lost either and this is a major plus for the movie.Some other plusses are extremely cool effects in the dream worlds, likable and believable characters whose interactions are fun to watch, effective action scenes, light comedic moments that pop up rarely but never fall flat and a satisfying emotional arc for our main character.  Truly there are many positive aspects to this movie.Some minuses are that it's a bit too long with a few dragging dialog sequences that could probably have been edited down.  This leads to the fact that it does slow down in parts such that you begin to get antsy (not that I have a short attention span but in a world where anything can happen?).  Despite the preceding two sentences I have to admit that all the dialog added to the movie in one way or another.I was a bit distracted by the fact that the dream rules - although meticulously laid out (which is appreciated) - did not always feel like the movie followed to the letter as laid forth.  (possible minor spoilers) For example the rules of time of a dream within a dream, etc. are laid forth but at times things seem to happen way too fast a layer or two in compared with what we know the rules are.  I also understand that the filmmakers wanted a realistic representation but I felt that dreams were - on the whole - rather boring.  I get that these particular dreams were tailor made but they were so orderly it was a bit disconcerting.  No chaos, no random events, unless provoked by the outside world (or only the next layer up),  just cities and buildings and people in suits.  Speaking for myself (but I'm insane) my dreams are a bit more chaotic.  Then again there were a few surprises in there and a few very cool dream fight sequences.Overall, yes, I do recommend this movie.  It's not as complicated as you may initially think but carries its own for sure.  The characters are well developed and the action carried out quite well within a well defined universe.  It is long and you may struggle with some of the rules but overall the movie is rewarding in visuals, story, overall action and emotional depts.

1304997,A1P800XYV3NZYA,B002ZG980U,DTL,"[1, 1]","This is an excellent film. It's a daring film too. Like another film, The Usual Suspects, it starts in the present with a scene between an old man and a young one. The old man asks him what he wants and the young man struggles to recall what he wants from the old man. It leads to the start of the story in the past and an extraction job on the train to Kyoto, Saito's offer to Cobb, the assembly of the team, putting together their game plan for putting an idea into a financial rival's mind, the dream shared aboard the jet, onto the opening scene again when the young man why he's here then onto the final scene. The plot is superb. One man, Cobb, wants to find his way home to his family while another one, Saito, is willing to pay a fortune to change the outcome of events with a rival business firm through the inception of an idea into his rival's mind. The cast is also superb. It took more than Leonard DiCaprio to pull this story off. In this case there was some strong writing. Something closer to six or seven characters were needed for the development of the plot. Is it too complicated or just too intriguing? I really enjoy watching a good film again and again and have truly enjoyed Inception. Dreaming by itself was no basis for a story but to the credit of Inception it introduced dream-sharing by way of a new technology. In view of the developments over the past 60 years viewers will find it quite easy enough to suspend their disbelief. Cobb and his wife, Mal, put the learning to use by way of extracting ideas by people. Once they began building dreams within dreams extraction was easier but time moves at a different and slower pace at various levels of a dream. It can also become difficult to distinguish a dream from reality and they finally lose their way into the sub-conscious. After fifty years down there Cobb tries inception on Mal and plants an idea in her mind which leads to their return but Mal suspects that she's still dreaming and wants Cobb to return to reality. One night she tries to blackmail Cobb by informing the police that she suspects her husband will kill her. Dreams can be usually brought to an end when the dreamer runs out of time on the machine or is killed. After she kills herself Cobb leaves the country to avoid arrest but he's still deeply filled with regret and guilt about Mal who is constantly trying to keep him with her. It's interesting how one storyline is affecting the other one and the characterization which results from it.Ken Watanabe plays Mr. Saito. He's heard about extraction and rumours about conception. He's convinced that he will be financially ruined by his rival, Mr. Fischer. Now he's heard rumors about Cobb's skill but before he asks Cobb he wants to make sure that he's talking to the right mind. So he arranges an audition for Cobb's crew under tough conditions with himself as the target. Cobb extracts the information but he realizes that Saito has known all along about the job from start and asks why? Saito was never interested in the extraction but the level of Cobb's skill. While Cobb extracted the information, Saito wasn't impressed with the level of skill that Cobb showed. His opinion of Cobb quickly rises when he realizes that he's still dreaming. Cobb placed him in a dream inside a dream. In the following scene Saito makes an offer to Cobb of financial reward and a safe return to America if he can succeed in planting an idea in his rival's mind. Money is no problem with Saito. So Cobb finds a top-notch crew who will work for him and his partner, Arthur. DiCaprio clearly dominates the first crew but when Saito tells him to put together a better team he becomes part of the team. Michael Caine puts in a strong appareanance as Cobb's father-in-law who finds him another architect in dream-sharing, Ariadne played by Ellen Page. Then it's onto Africa for an interview with an old friend, Eames played by Tom Hardy, who's a skillful thief and forger and introduces Cobb to Yusuf, the Chemist played by Dileep Rao. Fischer, played by Cillian Murphy, puts in another good performance as Saito's rival. What's really interesting are all the contributions everybody makes towards the development of the story. It is a well written story and well performed one. You'll also appreciate the quick pace.While the dream starts on the jet. The levels of the dream can always be identified. The first level of the dream can always be identified by the rain in a city downtown. The primary development is the appearance of projections from Fischer's mind into dream who will defend him against any attempt at extraction. On this level Saito is shot and dying but on the lower levels it will take longer for him to die. Eames attempts to kill him and end the dream but the sedative taken demands their return to consciousness in a particular fashion. If they die they are lost in a sub-consciousness of the dreamer. So they must go onto the next level of the dream inside a van that Yusuf is driving. The second level of the dream is found in an expensive hotel where Cobb plays a figure on this level known as Mr. Charles and poses as one of the projections sent to guard Fischer. Mr. Charles gains Fischer's trust and convinces him that a corporate figure in his father's company is betraying him and the only way to learn the truth is entering a third level of the dream. The third level takes place in winter and the mountains where Fischer fights to learn the truth and the team plants an idea in him.In the meantime Saito dies during the assault. The scenes in the sub-conscicous take place in beautiful weather on the seaside. The final beach scene leads you to an earlier scene from the start of the film: an old man asks Cobb what he wants. The old man is Saito who was killed and has been lost for years. Cobb now remembers the audition for Saito, the inception and his confrontation with Mal. He urges Saito, now an old man filled with his regrets and guilt to come back with him and be young again. Well, the next scene tells you what happen he finds himself waking aboard the jet with Fischer, Saito and his crew. Saito places a call to set things in motion which will clear the way for Cobb's return home.I've seen this film on numerous occasions over the past few years. It just keeps getting better. It only proves the importance of good writing and acting to one another as well as editing and directing. Suspense simply is not a factor. Yet the story constantly grips you. You simply don't realize the length of the film by its quick pace of the story.",5,"Science fiction, fantasy, drama, mystery or adventure?",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,6566,"['excellent', 'film',

1304998,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,B002ZG980U,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[53, 124]","For months, just like everyone else on Earth, I've been hearing and seeing the buzz surrounding Christopher Nolan's newest film, Inception. However, due to time constraints caused by college and other personal matters, seeing the movie wasn't high on my list of priorities. Since I just got a mini vacation from college this week, I found some time to finally watch it, and I must tell you, the movie left me scratching my head. Now don't let that past sentence fool you. I wasn't scratching my head over how ""complex"" the movie was, but rather over why so many people are hailing this as one of the greatest movies ever made. Sure, this movie is a deep and complex brain twister if you're only familiar with the cookie-cutter Hollywood swill like Smokin' Aces or the Twilight franchise, but go read a Philip K. Dick book or watch a film by Satoshi Kon or Andrei Tarkovski, then come back and tell me how ""genius"" Inception is.STORY""Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the best there is at extraction: stealing valuable secrets inside the subconscious during the mind's vulnerable dream state. His skill has made him a coveted player in industrial espionage but also has made him a fugitive and cost him dearly. Now he may get a second chance if he can do the impossible: inception, planting an idea rather than stealing one. If they succeed, Cobb and his team could pull off the perfect crime. But no planning or expertise can prepare them for a dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy only Cobb could have seen coming.""-Taken from product description (too lazy to summarize plot myself).CHARACTERSWhat's a movie, regardless of how thought-out the plotting is without any interesting or properly fleshed-out characters? Unfortunately, Nolan overlooked properly developing characters or even giving them anything interesting or charming to their personalities so that we could latch on to them as the movie went along. With the exception of Cobb, the characters are either mere plot devices or exposition magnets. The biggest exposition magnet by far is Ariadne played by the miscast Ellen Page. She spoon feeds every little detail to the audience, not letting us think for ourselves. Some of the worst offenses are with the scenes with Ariadne telling Cobb after a flashback or dream ""You have some dark stuff buried in you."" You really think so? Whatever happened to ""show, don't tell?"" Cobb's inner demons revolving around his dead wife, Mal, had some potential, but I wasn't emotionally moved at any point in the film since Nolan was too focused on the architecture of the dreamworld and the little ""ticks"" going on with it rather than actual character development. Supporting characters like Saito and Arthur were very dull since like everyone else, were just plot devices.EXPOSITION, EXPOSITION! RUSH IT OUT A-S-A-P!For a movie acting like it's intelligent, it sure talks down to the audience. As stated before, nothing is left to the imagination. Much superior dream-related films like Total Recall (1990) and Paprika (2006) establish their own rules about dreams and create dreamworlds that require one or two little bits of exposition and after that, you fully understand their workings and can enjoy the rest of the films without further explanation. However, the dreamworld in Inception was way over-developed since there's too much to the structure as to where it requires constant explanation. This is a clear case of too much complexity killing a potentially good idea. Some might defend the heavy dialogue, stating that the explanations give people a full understanding of the universe Nolan created. However, it doesn't work with me because when I watch a movie, I care about character development and exploration of certain ideas, I could care less about every tiny detail in a certain universe since I only want enough information as to where I can follow it.LACK OF ORIGINALITYLots of people are hailing this as very creative and original. I can't disagree more with this notion because this feels like a stale copy of Paprika. Paprika focused on psychotherapists diving into the dreams of their patients to understand the subconscious better and to get information important to them (such as the theft of their technological breakthrough, the DC Mini). Inception focuses on people diving into peoples' dreams so they can steal or plant ideas. While Paprika had better visuals and characters to go with its dreamworlds, Inception opts for very conventional imagery and bland characters, thinking that the ""amazing"" multi-layered dreamworld is enough to hold the movie together.TOO MUCH CONVENTIONALITYFor a movie focusing on dreams, Nolan's take on dreams was terribly vanilla. I don't know about the rest of you, but while my dreams can relate to parts of me that are entirely personal, they're largely nonsensical, unpredictable, and depending on who you talk to, disturbing. The lack of predictability in someone's mind renders the idea of a ""dream architect"" successfully creating a dreamworld in someone's head as a pretty silly one. Having Paris fold in on itself and having rotating mirrors on the streets wasn't too imaginative, and that's the only ""surreal"" imagery you get in this dream-themed film, everything else looks very conventional.PRETENDING TO BE ""SMART""It looks like Nolan made some quick searches on Wikipedia to shoe-horn in some ""smart"" ideas into the film. The best example of this would be when Arthur explains to Ariadne the concept of the Penrose Stairs and explains how it's an infinite loop, and how it's that concept that's used to confuse inception victims, then the camera moves down to show that it's a regular staircase. Wow, wasn't that genius?!! The other part that pretends to be ""smart"" is the plotting. Again, Total Recall and Paprika successfully merged fantasy and reality and really twisted the audience's minds questioning what's happening is real or not. With Inception, however, it's quite easy to follow the dreams within dreams within dreams within dreams because they're neatly separated from each other, you just have to keep track of them (I guess Nolan thinks we're too stupid to do that). The last quarter or so of the movie gets extra convoluted with quick cuts between the multi-layered dreams and Cobb facing Mal in others. I guess this was supposed to make the movie puzzle-like and give the audience something to solve.SOUNDTRACKNolan depends on Hans Zimmer to deliver an overblown score for an overblown movie. Since Nolan forgot to properly develop characters and give them any legitimate tension, he depends on Zimmer to fill nearly ever second of the movie with music to drive home how we're supposed to feel in certain scenes. Look, music can be a great element in enhancing the emotion in certain scenes, but when you're depending entirely on it to drive home certain scenes, that's just unprofessional.FINAL WORDAt the end of the day, Inception is just another ""style over substance"" over-priced summer cash-in (much like Nolan's previous movie, The Dark Knight), but unlike most others of its ilk, it really hurts itself by pretending to look like a thinking-man's film. At least the recent Transformers movies are honest with being loud special effects vehicles and the fans will agree with that notion. I'll give Inception some more points than that blue abomination Avatar since it felt a little more ambitious than that blue liberal propaganda piece, but it's still quite a wretched picture. If you want some great and truly thought-provoking sci-fi, go read the Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick and go watch Paprika (2006), Total Recall (1990), Solaris (1972), and Stalker (1979).The day that people stop looking at Nolan's movies through rose-colored glasses can't come sooner.",1,A stupid

1305000,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,B002ZG980U,dylan21484nj,"[3, 4]","How does a director follow up one of the biggest films of all time? By doing a film with more action and explosions? Or by directing a film that is even more ambitious and thought-provoking? Christopher Nolan seems to have found the answer with Inception: you do both.After The Dark Knight's massive success, it's no wonder that Warner Bros. gave Nolan carte blanche to do whatever he wanted with his next movie. And boy, does he. A creation spawned from his own mind (a rarity that a film this big isn't a sequel or an adaptation of a comic book or children's novel these days), Nolan delves into the realm of dreams and the subconscious with Inception.Describing what Inception is about in a mere paragraph is nearly impossible, as you'll notice the back of the Blu-ray/DVD combo package lacks the customary brief synopsis. But I'll do my best to describe the film here: Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team (populated by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, and Ellen Paige) specialize in ""extraction"" - stealing secrets from a person's mind through their dreams. Cobb, a fugitive of the law, takes one last job with the hope of being able to go home to his children. But this job may be the most difficult of all - inception, or the act of planting an idea in a subject's mind. Problem is, the human mind can't be fooled into adopting outside ideas very easily. So Cobb and his team must delve into the deepest recesses of a man's subconscious, by infiltrating a dream within a dream withing a dream, to plant the idea in the most subtle way possible. But Cobb has a secret in his own subconscious that could jeopardize the entire operation. And failing the mission might land Cobb in prison for the rest of his life, either in reality or in his own mind.Inception is one of those films that is so complex (there are literally four plot threads simultaneously occuring at the same time during the film's climax), that attempting to pick up the film halfway through and understanding it all is impossible (which means good luck to anyone who ever watches this for the first time once it is inevitably aired on television). It may frustrate those viewers who still like to check their brains at the door when they watch their action films, as plot explanation and plot details come so fast that even a quick bathroom break might leave you scrambling to make sense of the next scene. Even the film's character's get a little confounded, as Ellen Paige's Ariadne asks at one point, ""Whose subconscious are we going into, exactly?"" It's one of those film's that is ""spoiler-proof"" since knowing how the film ends means nothing if you didn't know how the film got there.And that is truly a wonderful thing in an age where films are so predictable that we know exactly what a movie is about and how it is going to end just from watching the previews and commercials. Nolan loves the element of surprise and keenly knows that it desire to find out will fill even more theater seats, as even the pre-release trailers for Inception gave no clue as to what it was about. It also doesn't hurt that long-time collaborators like cinematographer Wally Pfister and composer Hans Zimmer bring their stellar work to Nolan's world of dream thievery. And the best films keep people talking long after the credits roll, and the film's brilliantly ambiguous end is truly up to the viewer to decide and postulate their own theories as to what really happened.Inception is one of the best mindbending science fiction films of our time, taking its rightful place among greats like The Matrix, Dark City, and Blade Runner. It's a film that begs to be watched more than once. Now you can buy this Blu-ray/DVD combo pack of Inception to watch, rewatch, and watch yet again.

1305001,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B002ZG980U,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Christopher Nolan may be the most brilliant, unconventional mainstream director working in Hollywood today, crafting intricate stories where narrative forms are stretched and twisted.Nowhere is this more obvious than &#34;Inception,&#34; which turns into a multi-level M&ouml;bius strip -- worlds within worlds, dreams within dreams. Nolan delights in being able to conjure strange worlds that could never exist in real life, but he crafts a very heartfelt, powerful story for those visuals -- a story of love and loss, ambition and power, and a broken man haunted by guilt that constantly chases him through every dream.In the not-too-distant future (next Sunday A.D.), the military has created a technology that allows artificial shared dreaming. Within multi-leveled dreams, architects can create elaborate worlds, and special &#34;extractors&#34; can get information from a sleeping subject's brain. Oh, and there are several layers of dreaming, each with a different period of time passing.The movie opens with Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) trying to extract some information from tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe). It turns out that this was actually an elaborate audition by Saito, who wants to hire them for an &#34;inception&#34; -- to plant a new idea in someone's head. Cobb isn't interested until Saito offers to clear him of the murder of his wife, which would allow him to return to his young children.Their target: Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), who has just inherited a massive energy conglomerate from his cold, callous father. Saito wants the company dissolved before it can become too powerful, so he wants the idea incepted into Robert's head.So Cobb gets together a gang of the best: clever forger Eames (Tom Hardy), dream-chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao), and the new architect Ariadne (Ellen Page). But only Ariadne sees how troubled Cobb is, and that the memory of his dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) is deliberately sabotaging every mission he undertakes. As the team weaves their elaborate web of deception and dreams around Robert, Cobb finds that his demons are threatening their mission.You have to give it to Christopher Nolan: he doesn't dumb down his movies for the masses. &#34;Inception&#34; is a hard movie to even summarize because it's constantly growing more complicated -- the team is spread out over different dream levels, with different time periods passing and different perils attacking them simultaneously. It's half heist caper and half sci-fi meta-thriller... if that even makes sense.And while Nolan sculpts a strange Escheresque dream-world of labyrinths and never-ending stairs, he also crafts some powerful subplots about love and loss. As the plot unwinds, he intertwines Cobb and Fischer's personal issues with the main story of inception. Suddenly the constant firefights, explosions and free-falling elevators/vans aren't the only reason we're invested -- the audience is truly left wanting to see both men work out their issues and find some measure of inner peace.It also has spectacularly good special effects, particularly Arthur's battle in the hotel -- he scampers across the walls and ceilings, grappling with projections as he floats through empty halls. Not to mention the scene where Ariadne turns a whole city upside-down... literally.Honestly, the biggest problem with the movie is that the dreams sometimes make too much sense. Why do Fischer's projections have to actually TRAVEL to attack the team instead of... I don't know, materializing inside the building?Nolan also populates &#34;Inception&#34; with a lot of actors that he's cast in other projects, especially &#34;The Dark Knight Rises.&#34; In fact, I can't help but wonder if DiCaprio's role was originally offered to Christian Bale, because we've also got Cotillard, Hardy, Watanabe, Murphy, Gordon-Levitt and Michael Caine. There are actually only a couple major actors who haven't worked with Nolan elsewhere.But this is one of DiCaprio's best roles, even if he's not very convincing as a father -- his Cobb is riddled with guilt and numb sorrow, and it's only prodding from Ariadne that finally gets him to confront his issues. All the other actors give lovely performances as well -- Cotillard is particularly wrenching as a strange shallow shade of a madwoman, as is Murphy as the downtrodden son of a powerful man.&#34;Inception&#34; is the kind of movie that we desperately need more of -- a wild M&ouml;bius strip of complex ideas, brilliant direction and powerful acting. This is truly a one-of-a-kind film, and not one to be missed.",5,"Non, je ne regrette rien...",1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,4609,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'brilliant', 'unconventional', 'mainstream', 'director', 'working', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'crafting', 'intricate', 'stories', 'where', 'narrative', 'forms', 'are', 'stretched', 'more', 'obvious', '34', 'Inception', '34', 'multi-level', 'M', 'ouml', 'strip', 'worlds', 'worlds', 'dreams', 'dreams', 'Nolan', 'delights', 'being', 'able', 'conjure', 'strange', 'worlds', 'could', 'never', 'exist', 'real', 'life', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'powerful', 'story', 'visuals', 'story', 'love', 'loss', 'ambition', 'power', 'broken', 'man', 'haunted', 'guilt', 'constantly', 'dream.In', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'next', 'Sunday', 'A.D.', 'military', 'created', 'technology', 'artificial', 'shared', 'dreaming', 'multi-leveled', 'dreams', 'architects', 'can', 'create', 'elaborate', 'worlds', 'special', '34', 'extractors', '34', 'can', 'get', 'information', 'sleeping', 'subject', 'brain', 'Oh', 'are', 'several', 'layers', 'dreaming', 'different', 'period', 'time', 'passing.The', 'movie', 'Dom', 'Cobb', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'partner', 'Arthur', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'trying', 'extract', 'information', 'tycoon', 'Saito', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'out', 'was', 'actually', 'elaborate', 'audition', 'Saito', 'who', 'hire', '34', 'inception', '34', 'plant', 'new', 'idea', 'someone', 'head', 'Cobb', ""n't"", 'interested', 'Saito', 'offers', 'clear', 'murder', 'wife', 'would', 'allow', 'return', 'young', 'children.Their', 'target', 'Robert', 'Fischer', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'who', 'just', 'inherited', 'massive', 'energy', 'conglomerate', 'cold', 'callous', 'father', 'Saito', 'company', 'dissolved', 'can', 'become', 'too', 'powerful', 'idea', 'incepted', 'Robert', 'head.So', 'Cobb', 'together', 'gang', 'best', 'clever', 'forger', 'Eames', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'dream-chemist', 'Yusuf', 'Dileep', 'Rao', 'new', 'architect', 'Ariadne', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'only', 'Ariadne', 'how', 'troubled', 'Cobb', 'memory', 'dead', 'wife', 'Mal', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'deliberately', 'sabotaging', 'mission', 'team', 'elaborate', 'web', 'deception', 'dreams', 'Robert', 'Cobb', 'demons', 'are', 'threatening', 'mission.You', 'have', 'give', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'down', 'movies', 'masses', '34', 'Inception', '34', 'hard', 'movie', 'even', 'summarize', 'constantly', 'growing', 'more', 'complicated', 'team', 'spread', 'out', 'different', 'dream', 'levels', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'passing', 'different', 'perils', 'attacking', 'simultaneously', 'half', 'heist', 'caper', 'half', 'sci-fi', 'meta-thriller', 'even', 'sense.And', 'Nolan', 'strange', 'Escheresque', 'dream-world', 'labyrinths', 'never-ending', 'stairs', 'also', 'crafts', 'powerful', 'subplots', 'love', 'loss', 'plot', 'unwinds', 'Cobb', 'Fischer', 'personal', 'issues', 'main', 'story', 'inception', 'Suddenly', 'constant', 'firefights', 'explosions', 'free-falling', 'elevators/vans', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'reason', ""'re"", 'invested', 'audience', 'truly', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'men', 'work', 'out', 'issues', 'find', 'measure', 'inner', 'peace.It', 'also', 'spectacularly', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'particularly', 'Arthur', 'battle', 'hotel', 'walls', 'ceilings', 'grappling', 'projections', 'empty', 'halls', 'Not', 'mention', 'scene', 'where', 'Ariadne', 'whole', 'city', 'upside-down', 'literally.Honestly', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'dreams', 'sometimes', 'make', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'Why', 'do', 'Fischer', 'projections', 'have', 'actually', 'TRAVEL', 'attack', 'team', 'instead', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'materializing', 'building', 'Nolan', 'also', '34', 'Inception', '34', 'lot', 'actors', 'cast', 'other', 'projects', 'especially', '34', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises.', '34', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'DiCaprio', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'offered', 'Christian', 'Bale', ""'ve"", 'also', 'got', 'Cotillard', 'Hardy', 'Watanabe', 'Murphy', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'are', 'actually', 'only', 'couple', 'major', 'actors', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'Nolan', 'elsewhere.But', 'one', 'DiCaprio', 'best', 'roles', 'even', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'father', 'Cobb', 'riddled', 'guilt', 'numb', 'sorrow', 'only', 'prodding', 'Ariadne', 'finally', 'confront', 'issues', 'other', 'actors', 'give', 'lovely', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Cotillard', 'particularly', 'wrenching', 'strange', 'shallow', 'shade', 'madwoman', 'Murphy', 'downtrodden', 'son', 'powerful', 'man.', '34', 'Inception', '34', 'kind', 'movie', 'desperately', 'need', 'more', 'wild', 'M', 'ouml', 'strip', 'complex', 'ideas', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'powerful', 'acting', 'truly', 'one-of-a-kind', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

1305004,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B002ZG980U,E. David Swan,"[2, 3]","I've loved every Christopher Nolan movie I've ever seen from Memento to The Dark Knight but Inception left me a bit unsatisfied. My main issue is the same issue that many people had with the Matrix movies in that there are no well defined rules under which the movie operates. I will attempt as best I can to avoid any spoilers but it's hard when talking about the mechanics of the movie.As one might tell from the previews and articles on Inception it's about delving into dreams. Using technology and drugs Leonardo DiCaprio and his crew are able to inject themselves into peoples dreams in order to extract information for things like industrial espionage. In order to accomplish this they use an architect to construct the logistics of the dream in a way to best accomplish their task. Death in a dream wakes the dreamer. Also, there is a severe time dilation since a dream moves as fast as the human mind rather than as fast as the real world so minutes of sleep can produce hours of dreams. The plot centers around DiCaprio attempting to produce an inception. An inception is the implantation of an idea into a subject's brain while convincing them that it is their own idea. Apparently this is a very difficult task and requires a three level dream within a dream within a dream as well as the use of heavy sedatives. Having a three layer dream will produce an even greater level of time dilation and I as best as I can remember DiCaprio said that as far as the dreamers were concerned this process would take what appears to them to be ten years despite sleeping only around ten hours. This time dilation was apparently important enough that Ellen Page repeated it for emphasis and the thought of this being a ten year operation was pretty intriguing. So where are the problems?Again, I'm trying to avoid spoiler but I will reveal some smaller plot points to make my argument. The target of the inception will be a wealthy heir played by Cillian Murphy who played The Scarecrow in the Batman movies. Things immediately go wonky when it becomes obvious that Murphy's character has been trained to resist invasions into his mind and he immediately launches a counter attack by his sub conscious represented by armed assailants. The next problem is that DiCaprio's group used a sedative that's so powerful that if someone is killed in the dream rather than wake they will descend into a severely time dilated abyss where their mind will be trapped for decades likely driving them insane. I would assume the movie is taking place in Murphy's dream which I guess would give him an edge. Murphy seemed only capable of fighting them subconsciously and didn't even recognize the armed assailants as representatives of his own psyche. What I couldn't figure out was since the attackers were his subconscious everything must be representational rather than real. What did a bullet through the chest represent? Was it a successful domination of will? If someone is shot but lingers does that mean that the two are locked in some kind of mental battle of wills. From my experience if I'm shot in dream I could be perfectly fine in a moment but in this movie wounds seem to be as permanent as an injury in the real world. In fact, besides the occasional tilting of the world and loss of gravity at one point there didn't seem to be much difference between the dream world and the real world. I have no idea whether Cillian Murphy's sub conscious guards were horrible shots or if this was part of a dream. It seems hard to believe that several people opening up with heavy automatic weapons on a stationary van could miss with every bullet. The last big issue was that this so called time dilation seemed only to occur at times where it was convenient to the plot. Not only did the operation not take a purported ten years I would estimate that start to finish it took maybe two to four hours a most which means it was actually less time than the ten hours that they had Cillian Murphy available. Yet at one particular important plot point an event that would have taken only a few seconds allowed them I would estimate 45 minutes or so of apparent time. There was no consistency. Last but not least was how relentless the action was once things kicked up and there was this ever present heavy musical score.Christopher Nolan has had such a consistent track record of great movies that even a good movie like Inception felt disappointing. The acting and casting are fantastic, the special effects are brilliant and there are tons of plot threads with powerful emotional impacts but I just couldn't get past the fact that the general plot felt lazy.",4,A Film Without Rules (and not in a good way),1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,4642,"[""'ve"", 'loved', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Memento', 'Dark', 'Knight',

1305006,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002ZG980U,Ed Uyeshima,"[46, 61]","Empathy turns out to be the biggest challenge that filmmaker Christopher Nolan faces in his audaciously intricate, sometimes confounding 2010 sci-fi action thriller. It's a 148-minute somersault of a ride viscerally engaging in its vivid elaboration of lucid dreaming. Ironically, there is little time to feel for the characters involved when the whole point of the movie is that nothing is meant to feel real. This dramatic dilemma is almost completely shouldered by the main protagonist Dom Cobb, a professional thief specializing in corporate espionage whose sharpened gifts as an ""extractor"" allows him to enter the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Heading up aMission Impossible-type task force, Cobb has become aShane-like solitary figure whose talents have cost him his family. He wants nothing more than to see the faces of his two young children.The movie wastes no time in giving Cobb a final mission, his one last shot at redemption which will allow him to reunite with his family back in the states. A Japanese tycoon named Saito wants Cobb to perform an act of ""inception"" in which he would plant an idea in the subconscious of Robert Fischer Jr., the son of a corporate rival who is about to inherit his father's energy conglomerate. Saito wants Fischer to dissolve the company to prevent the corporation's inevitable takeover of global energy resources, but Cobb's participation represents a risky maneuver that conjures up memories of his dead wife Mal. She figures in the dream episodes in unexpected ways that invariably cloud Cobb's judgment in executing upon the mission for Saito. A crack team has been assembled to aid Cobb - Arthur, the point man who researches the targets whose dreams will be infiltrated; Eames, a cocky forger who has the ability to change identities inside dreams; Yusuf, a chemist who has developed the powerful sedatives that take Cobb and crew into the dream state; and Ariadne, a preternaturally talented graduate student whom Cobb and Arthur train as their new architect.As both writer and director, Nolan methodically bends the storyline into a labyrinth that turns out to be circular in structure and contains at least  four layers of dreams in which the task force must tag team in order to wake up to the next higher level until they each face reality. This is easier said than done since he attempts to show the unconscious as a supremely unruly place where nothing ultimately makes sense, and that's the film's major conundrum since it demands that the narrative must make some amount of sense to make the viewer feel engaged with the story being told. Leonardo DiCaprio brings his trademark intensity to Cobb and manages a gravitas that helps ground the story at a human level, even when the plot convolutions get more and more elaborate and far-fetched. There are some impressive CGI set-pieces like the street of Paris folding over like an omelet, a train careening down a busy downtown street, and the eerie sight of a vacant city in a virtual limbo. Other scenes border on the silly like Arthur's fight scene amid a rotating hotel that make him look like he's doing a2001riff on Fred Astaire's classic dance routine inRoyal Wedding, or the way Ariadne precociously diagnoses the solutions to fatalistic dreams like an worldly scholar.By no means does the approach translate into ineffectual performances by the rest of the eclectic cast. It's just that the actors reflect the generally poker-faced manner expected within the sci-fi genre. Joseph Gordon-Levitt ((500) Days of Summer) plays Arthur just that way as does Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) appropriately inscrutable as Saito. Ellen Page (Juno) neutralizes her naturally sardonic manner to play up Ariadne's nave curiosity, but to her defense, she has some of the clunkiest dialogue to deliver. Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao fare better as Eames and Yusuf, respectively simply because they play plot devices more than people. Cillian Murphy (Breakfast on Pluto) channels his usually intimidating intensity into Fischer's deceptively becalming manner, while an almost unrecognizable Tom Berenger manages to play his father's loyal associate with welcome gusto. As Mal, Marion Cotillard (La Vie en Rose) has by far the film's most challenging role, maintaining a careful balance between a spectral figure of longing for Cobb and a manipulative femme fatale.As one would expect from a Nolan film, all the production details are exquisite. Wally Pfister's astonishing cinematography contributes immeasurably to the film's overall hypnotic effect, and Hans Zimmer's foreboding, percussive score thrusts the drama forward with momentum. This movie is too startling a work to ignore, but it would be disingenuous to say that this venture reflects a grand vision since the story is basically an elaborate heist movie. Everything is so well thought out that Nolan may have inadvertently prevented his audience from feeling the full emotional impact of the ending despite the superb editing job by Lee Smith that juggles all the concurrent dreams together. This is still masterful filmmaking from someone who could have focused a tad less on technique and a tad more on the untamed heart that really alters the order within our dreams.",4,"Artfully

Therefore, a plan can quickly go awry unless you have a very skilled and cunning person who can outmaneuver these Perceptions.The person hired for the job is Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) with the help of his crew members (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Tom Hardy and Ellen Page).  The target for inception is energy magnate Fischer (Cillian Murphy).  The team devise an eloborate scheme requiring 3 levels of a dreamstate, but at the last minute, end up requiring a 4th dreamstate to rescue two casualties.To complicate matters further (as if this story wasn't complicated enough), we also discover that Cobb has played this game before with his wife.  He had good intentions for doing so, but his intentions nonetheless came with deadly consequences.  As Cobb explains, when you plant an idea into someone's mind, that idea can either cure you or destroy you.  With his wife, it destroyed her.As the story progresses, we witness just how much it's destroyed her.  And nearly destroys Cobb, too.  Not only does he feel tremendous guilt over his past decisions (reminding me of his role in Shutter Island), but also because she seriously complicates his already complicated plans.This movie tests your mental acuity and plays with your perceptions of reality.  The world created here came with rules I didn't fully understand.For example, I didn't fully understand why the dreams needed to be realistic or how someone can be so defensive while in a dream state.  I thought the whole point of entering a dream is that this person's defenses are down and they'll accept whatever reality you show them.I also wasn't sure if all Perceptions are automatic or if you plant them there, since Cobb had them, too.Nonetheless, I still enjoyed this film, although at times, I felt it moved too slowly.  I thought director Christopher Nolan was the perfect choice to organize this complicated film since he so carefully organized two other complicated films of his, Memento and Following.  I also liked the musical score chosen with it's deep trombone sound adding drama at key points.Inception is about planting ideas.  With the mindbender ending, I was left wondering who had been planting these ideas all along.  I was left thinking about a question that had been asked in this movie -- if you don't know which reality you're in, why not choose the one you like best?I could go back and think about how and when this idea got planted....but I think my head would explode.",4,Who's really behind the wheel here?,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,3011,"['Inception', 'highly', 'complex', 'film', 'following', 'dream', 'dream', 'dream', 'dream', '4', 'levels', 'dreams', 'keep', 'track', 'levels', 'are', 'necessary', 'though', 'successful', 'inception', 'take', 'place.This', 'film', 'believe', 'world', 'where', 'possible', 'enter', 'other', 'people', 'dreams', 'extract', 'plant', 'ideas', 'Apparently', ""n't"", 'top', 'secret', 'though', 'targets', 'have', 'protected', 'intruders', 'planting', 'militant', 'Perceptions', 'ward', 'off', 'Therefore', 'plan', 'can', 'quickly', 'go', 'awry', 'have', 'very', 'skilled', 'cunning', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'outmaneuver', 'Perceptions.The', 'person', 'hired', 'job', 'Dom', 'Cobb', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'help', 'crew', 'members', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Dileep', 'Rao', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'target', 'inception', 'energy', 'magnate', 'Fischer', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'team', 'devise', 'eloborate', 'scheme', 'requiring', '3', 'levels', 'dreamstate', 'last', 'minute', 'end', 'up', 'requiring', '4th', 'dreamstate', 'rescue', 'two', 'casualties.To', 'complicate', 'matters', 'further', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'complicated', 'enough', 'also', 'discover', 'Cobb', 'played', 'game', 'wife', 'had', 'good', 'intentions', 'doing', 'so', 'intentions', 'nonetheless', 'came', 'deadly', 'consequences', 'Cobb', 'when', 'plant', 'idea', 'someone', 'mind', 'idea', 'can', 'either', 'cure', 'destroy', 'wife', 'destroyed', 'story', 'witness', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'destroyed', 'nearly', 'destroys', 'Cobb', 'too', 'Not', 'only', 'feel', 'tremendous', 'guilt', 'past', 'decisions', 'reminding', 'role', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'also', 'seriously', 'already', 'complicated', 'plans.This', 'movie', 'tests', 'mental', 'acuity', 'plays', 'perceptions', 'reality', 'world', 'created', 'here', 'came', 'rules', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand.For', 'example', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'dreams', 'needed', 'be', 'realistic', 'how', 'someone', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'defensive', 'while', 'dream', 'state', 'thought', 'whole', 'point', 'entering', 'dream', 'person', 'defenses', 'are', 'down', ""'ll"", 'accept', 'reality', 'show', 'them.I', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'Perceptions', 'are', 'automatic', 'plant', 'there', 'Cobb', 'had', 'too.Nonetheless', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'times', 'felt', 'moved', 'too', 'slowly', 'thought', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'organize', 'complicated', 'film', 'so', 'carefully', 'organized', 'two', 'other', 'complicated', 'films', 'Memento', 'Following', 'also', 'liked', 'musical', 'score', 'chosen', 'deep', 'trombone', 'sound', 'adding', 'drama', 'key', 'points.Inception', 'planting', 'ideas', 'mindbender', 'ending', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'planting', 'ideas', 'was', 'left', 'thinking', 'question', 'had', 'been', 'asked', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'reality', ""'re"", 'why', 'not', 'choose', 'one', 'best', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'think', 'how', 'when', 'idea', 'got', 'planted', '.but', 'think', 'head', 'would', 'explode']",N/A

At the beginning you might find some resemblance withThe Matrixregarding what the perception of the real world is, or withTotal Recallregarding implanting memories, but Mr. Nolan manages to develop a one of a kind original and interesting story, with full action, spectacular SFX, you name it. No need to go into details, there are plenty in the other reviews, but do not let them spoil it, just watch it.Without any doubt this movie is a delight for fans of hard core science fiction, you might mistakenly think Philip K. Dick wrote the story. Because the plot unfolds like a flawless chess game played by two masters, following up the plot and digesting all the information is difficult, so this is a movie you might need to watch two o three times to fully grasp all the details.Amazon discounted launch price is quite a bargain, for just $17.99 you get the Blu-ray disc, the DVD and a digital copy you can play on your favorite mobile device. Nevertheless, watching the Blue-ray on a flat screen is quite an experience, so it is not worthy to save a couple of bucks for the DVD only version.

Captivating story, thought provoking, great visuals !  ... too much shooting and hunting ...In reply to the review entitled ""Rating Depends On How Much Foreign Film You've Watched"" I say:  I do not see much ***correlation*** between ""Inception"" and ""L'Ann&eacute;e derni&egrave;re &agrave; Marienbad"" or ""Hiroshima mon amour"", to the point that one might say these two Alain Resnais French films of 1961 and 1959, respectively are ... more original ... or deeper.  I have watched these two films without subtitles.""Inception"" is interesting, quite original, an attempt to explore the world of dreams.  The exploration is a combination of known things about dreams (e.g. outside stimuli influence dreams), and lesser known things (questions), such as ""What happens when we die in a dream ?"", ""How is a dream within a dream ?"", ""What happens if two or more people could share a dream ?""  The answers Chris Nolan (both British and American by birth) offers, may be viewed as speculations, of course, but, nonetheless are interesting.  Not seldom he gets the Physics right - Gravity (= acceleration, as Einstein points out):  loss of it; creation of temporal artificial gravity.  Chris Nolan suggest that Gravity effects propagate to dreams - true or not, but interesting.  He even suggests that in a dream world, Gravitation my pull in multiple directions !  Why not ?!I have my own questions:- Will understanding dreams help us further uncover the mysteries of the mind ?- Will we ever be able to design dreams - ours and others ?- Will we ever be able to share dreams ?  Will this be useful ?- Will we be able to visualize dreams, say on a TV scream dreams ? - ours and others ?- Will this help treat currently incurable and most destructive mind (brain) diseases such as Schizophrenia, Bipolar Syndrome, Alzheimer, Parkinson ?- Will we ever be able to do ""Extraction"" and ""Inception"" ? - for non-harmful, maybe good purposes ...So, while we may not fully agree with the story proposed to us, the film is thought provoking, but, because of the nested layered dreams (dreams within a dream within a dream ...), hard to follow for many viewers.  That is where the DVD/Blu-ray comes to the rescue - Rewind (many times) !  Not possible in the theater, but easily done at home.Next, please, pay attention:  at the end of the film, the top (""toupie"" in French, right ?) is still spinning, which allows us, the viewer, to formulate two possible interpretations:  1) It is, finally reality;  2) It is (still) a dream - maybe, everything was a dream from the very beginning ...  A fantasy ?  A good work of art (visual or written) should be susceptible to multiple interpretations, right ?  Hamlet:  he is tormented  - maybe he really saw (the ghost of) his father, maybe not, maybe his uncle murdered his father, maybe not ... should I take punitive action or not ("" ... to be or not to be ... "").  The Penrose Steps (nice drawings by Max Escher !) - an optical illusion:  are we going up or down ?  Maybe both at the same time.I like Leonardo di Caprio and Marion Cotillard a lot.  The personal story of the characters they play (story which causes trouble to all) brings humanity and depth to this film, and the two actors are very convincing in their roles.  By the way, ""Mal"" means ""bad"" in French.My only real criticism is this (therefore 4.5/5 stars):  too much shooting, too many people chasing each other, and too often (a diversion/distraction)- it makes it more attractive to some viewers, but ***lowers*** the overall value of the film !  It makes it look ""less deep"" than Chris Nolan would have liked.  Notice this:  The Academy nominated this film in several categories, among others:  ""Best Film"" (which refers to the producers, one being Chris Nolan), ""Best Original Story"" (Chris Nolan), but not ""Best Director"" (who is also Chris Nolan).  Maybe this is due exactly to the fact others noticed the same thing:  long and frequent chases, lots of shooting ...The thrilling should come more from the tension between characters, from the collision between their minds and souls, their problems, worries, and less from fast paced and sustained action sequences.Last but not least, I like the use of one of my longtime favorite songs:  ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" sung by Edith Piaf.  It is used in the film as a signal to wake-up the dreamers in a synchronized fashion (it even propagates from one dream level to the next), but, perhaps it also means this:  no matter what happens, or happened, whether this is reality or it is just a dream, I do not take anything back (I regret nothing).Good quality with extra features Blue-ray.

There a person's knowledge can be extracted against their will using techniques developed by Dominick (Leonardo DiCaprio). Basically he takes a team of trained dream thieves into a person's dream, then convinces the person in the dream to reveal their secret(s). Sometimes in the dream the person is put to sleep; this sets up a second dreamscape to operate within (hence the need for a dream team). Problem is, when one of the team dies in a multi-layered dream, he or she might never wake up. If all goes well, a big thump (&#34;kick&#34;) will either awaken everyone or alert them to start wrapping things up.

This might explain why some dreams give us the impression that they have lasted for many hours when in fact we have been dreaming for only a few hours in total.I'm not sure about the scientific base behind this, but it proves crucial for the viability of the main action sequence of the film.In all, the focus of ""Inception"" is not on the acting, so expect a lot of action, confusion and alternate-fictional-realities, but don't expect any serious Oscar nominations coming January.",3,Forgettable,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,1592,"[""'re"", 'reading', 'chances', 'are', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exposed', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'misled', 'believe', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'Inception', '.Let', 'straighten', 'things', 'out', 'not', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'modern', 'science', 'fiction.In', 'essence', 'Inception', 'regular', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'Hollywood', 'annually', 'movie', 'more', 'typical', 'shoots', 'explosions', 'CGI', 'action', 'flick', 'carried', 'context', 'plot', 'been', 'marketed', 'more', 'mature', 'complicated', 'usual', 'nothing', 'really', 'groundbreaking', 'sun.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'efforts', 'team', 'thieves', 'specialize', 'stealing', 'ideas', 'secrets', 'minds', 'people', 'dreams.The', 'team', 'leader', 'portrayed', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'revolutionary', 'task', 'planting', 'idea', 'mind', 'person', 'inception', '.This', 'endeavor', 'supposed', 'influence', 'individual', 'transform', 'planted', 'idea', 'action', 'real', 'life.The', 'main', 'memorable', 'concept', 'Inception', 'brain', 'faster', 'dream', 'state', 'might', 'explain', 'why', 'dreams', 'give', 'impression', 'have', 'lasted', 'many', 'hours', 'when', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'dreaming', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'total.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'scientific', 'base', 'crucial', 'viability', 'main', 'action', 'sequence', 'film.In', 'focus', 'Inception', 'not', 'acting', 'so', 'expect', 'lot', 'action', 'confusion', 'alternate-fictional-realities', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'serious', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'coming', 'January']",N/A

The only thing more gripping than the actual experience of watching Nolan's penmanship play out on-screen is the ambiguity that follows when the credits roll, which transforms everything you've seen into an intricate, wholly fascinating puzzle of a film.

I was somewhat hesitant because I had heard so little of this movie and just haven't been a Decaprio fan for a while.I was wrong in this case. For the most part this movie is well worth the watch. The only sub-par moments were:-There are parts where not only are they in someone's dream attempting to extract information, but they are in a dream, within a dream and although it wasn't ""difficult"" to follow, it was more ""annoying"" to follow. Some people have complained that they had difficulty following the plot because they didn't know if the characters were in a dream or the real world so they gave this movie an unjustified 1-2 stars. Just because a person couldn't follow the plot doesn't make this a bad movie.-This is a smart, thinking person's movie. Well acted, well written and well made. You just have to keep in mind that there's more than one reality here and it doesn't move in perfect chronological order and you will enjoy it.-The regular DVD (disc 3) only has the movie and ""languages"". There are no special features and extras on the regular DVD at all. For some reason, they put the full bluray movie on one disc and then special features on disc 2 that are also bluray only.

1305032,A10JDPEQ8GJ2K1,B002ZG980U,Erik Bateson,"[2, 3]","Director Christopher Nolan (""Memento,"" ""The Prestige,"" ""The Dark Knight"") continues his outstanding streak in ""Inception,"" his finest work to date and the best film of this young decade. What sets Nolan apart from a majority of other directors and screenwriters is his ability to dream big and follow through on his innovative ideas. He takes you to places you've never been, and in many ways, they are places you would've never imagined yourself visiting.Unlike most summer blockbusters, ""Inception"" actually requires you to think and demands that you pay close attention at all times. Understanding everything in this film is impossible in one viewing, but I am more than happy to take a look at it again.At the heart of it all is Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a thief who specializes in entering a person's dream and extracting beneficial information from deep within their subconscious. But Dom's skill at his trade has also come at a price - he's a wanted man and his crime has something to do with him being separated from his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), and their two children.Dom makes a living traveling the world doing extraction jobs with his longtime assistant Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). However, he is forced to put everything on hold when he gets an offer from Saito, a wealthy industrialist played by Ken Watanabe: enter someone's mind and insert an idea instead of removing one.The target is Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy), the son of Saito's most fearful competitor. Saito would like to see Robert voluntarily dissolve his father's empire, so it's up to Dom and his talented dream team - Arthur, Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy) and Yusuf (Dileep Roa) - to pry their way into his noggin, plant the seed and leave without ever being detected. In return they will all be richly compensated, especially Dom, who's promised a clean slate so he can return home and reunite with his two precious offspring. But pulling off their mission will not come easy, especially when a conflicted companion from Dom's past returns and threatens their lives and the whole operation.Often, it is unclear if what we are seeing is a dream or reality or a dream within a dream or even something else. One may think this would be a weakness. It is not; eventually, we realize what we are seeing, and up to that point, it's a lot of fun trying to figure it out.The film has jaw-dropping visuals, not unlike 1999's ""The Matrix."" The two movies are very similar in that they largely take place in an alternate reality where the rules of time and space are altered, and just like the Wachowski Brothers, Nolan has taken full advantage of all the possibilities this concept has to offer.In this summer (or any summer for that matter) that primarily consists of sequels, remakes and adaptations, it's extremely refreshing to be treated to an original film that genuinely challenges you to use your brain while also giving your eyeballs a stimulating canvas to feast upon.5 stars (out of 5)",5,SEE THIS FILM!,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,3000,"['Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Memento', 'Prestige', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'outstanding', 'streak', 'Inception', 'finest', 'work', 'date', 'best', 'film', 'young', 'decade', 'What', 'Nolan', 'apart', 'majority', 'other', 'directors', 'screenwriters', 'ability', 'dream', 'big', 'follow', 'innovative', 'ideas', 'places', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'places', 'would', ""'ve"", 'never', 'imagined', 'most', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'Inception', 'actually', 'think', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'times', 'Understanding', 'everything', 'film', 'impossible', 'one', 'viewing', 'am', 'more', 'happy', 'take', 'look', 'heart', 'Dom', 'Cobb', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'thief', 'who', 'entering', 'person', 'dream', 'extracting', 'beneficial', 'information', 'deep', 'subconscious', 'Dom', 'skill', 'trade', 'also', 'come', 'price', 'wanted', 'man', 'crime', 'something', 'do', 'being', 'separated', 'late', 'wife', 'Mal', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'two', 'children.Dom', 'living', 'traveling', 'world', 'doing', 'extraction', 'jobs', 'longtime', 'assistant', 'Arthur', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'However', 'forced', 'put', 'everything', 'hold', 'when', 'offer', 'Saito', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'played', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'enter', 'someone', 'mind', 'insert', 'idea', 'instead', 'removing', 'one.The', 'target', 'Robert', 'Fischer', 'Jr.', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'son', 'Saito', 'most', 'fearful', 'competitor', 'Saito', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Robert', 'voluntarily', 'dissolve', 'father', 'empire', 'up', 'Dom', 'talented', 'dream', 'team', 'Arthur', 'Ariadne', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Eames', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Yusuf', 'Dileep', 'Roa', 'pry', 'way', 'noggin', 'plant', 'seed', 'leave', 'ever', 'being', 'detected', 'return', 'will', 'be', 'richly', 'compensated', 'especially', 'Dom', 'who', 'promised', 'clean', 'slate', 'can', 'return', 'home', 'reunite', 'two', 'precious', 'offspring', 'pulling', 'off', 'mission', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'easy', 'especially', 'when', 'conflicted', 'companion', 'Dom', 'past', 'returns', 'lives', 'whole', 'operation.Often', 'unclear', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'dream', 'reality', 'dream', 'dream', 'even', 'something', 'else', 'One', 'may', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'weakness', 'not', 'eventually', 'realize', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'up', 'point', 'lot', 'fun', 'trying', 'figure', 'out.The', 'film', 'jaw-dropping', 'visuals', 'not', '1999', 'Matrix', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'largely', 'take', 'place', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'rules', 'time', 'space', 'are', 'altered', 'just', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'Nolan', 'taken', 'full', 'advantage', 'possibilities', 'concept', 'offer.In', 'summer', 'summer', 'matter', 'primarily', 'sequels', 'remakes', 'adaptations', 'extremely', 'refreshing', 'be', 'treated', 'original', 'film', 'genuinely', 'use', 'brain', 'also', 'giving', 'eyeballs', 'stimulating', 'canvas', 'feast', 'upon.5', 'stars', '5']",N/A

Aventura provides the benefit of a nice dinner before the show because of the many wonderful restaurants available to the public.We selected Rosalia, an Italian restaurant accessible both from inside the mall as well as from the courtyard where AMC theatres are located.From the start, this movie captured our imagination and as we did our morning walk today, we could talk of nothing else. The premise is people that learn to tap into their minds, utilizing the subconscious to recreate reality at different levels.What is new about this? We all dream, we are all capable of escaping reality by focusing on memories of the past, or returning to places we liked, where we felt safe. But in this movie, the experience is shared with others and learning about another person's mind and how they think, sometimes planting an idea that turns the other person's life into the reality of our choosing is new.We are able to experience these shared dreams through the power of film, but we come to understand that these people simply go into a trance of sorts, into a powerful recreation of a certain reality that they are able to share as a team.An architect is required, a person that builds a certain reality, shares it with the team for understanding and they go off, together, to experience highly emotional and philosophical escapes.Arthur played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dom Cobb masterfully played by Leonardo DiCaprio join to steal ideas for clients from the minds of their competitors.But as with all things, times are hard and Mr. Cobb becomes estranged from his family. Saito, played by Ken Watanabe, hires Cobb to get to Fischer, played by Cillian Murphy. The purpose is to plant an idea in the mind of this powerful businessman.Without giving the plot away, it gets so complicated that Cobb requires fresh talent and they hire an architecture student played by Ellen Page, a chemist, played by Dileep Rao and a forger played by Tom Hardy who designs the most incredible of experiences.To be perfectly honest, we could not hear everything that was said because the sound track overpowers voices but plan to acquire the DVD and with the tool of subtitles see this movie again to fully grasp the dialogue.Our minds are our greatest asset and few if any have tapped into its full potential.

1305044,A1X4P6CN08U57A,B002ZG980U,FicktionPhotography,"[2, 2]","As dreamers ourselves, we, as human beings, have always been unequivocally fascinated by dreams.  People have made a fortune on interpreting dreams and analyzing dreams or even publishing self help books that put dreams into a more tangible, legible, and easy-to-understand format.  Dreams can be powerful, enough so that if we wake up from them we are sometimes convinced, if only for a little while, that what happened in the dream actually happened in reality.  So, what happens when we can use that to the benefit or detriment of others?  Enter the movie Inception.Inception is a concept where a team of professionals can access your dreams, your subconscious, and alter it.  Mainly, they focus on extracting information, but Inception is when those professionals place information.  Not as easy as it sounds since, like fighting a disease, the subconscious will defend itself (oftentimes with training on how to do this) to keep Inception from happening.  On top of this, levels of subconscious are involved (a dream within a dream within a dream), a place called Limbo, and the threat of your own subconscious getting in the way.Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Cobb, leads a team to place information into the mind of a man whose father recently dies and leaves his larger than life company to him.  The son must disband the empire.  What with the above stated complications, the team must complete the task in a given amount of time and to do so without endangering themselves.The movie is extremely complex, and at 148 minutes, it doesn't seem long enough to explain all the subtle nuances of what is happening.  This is a definite &#34;pay attention to everything&#34; film and I would recommend not only watching it once but several times.  Thankfully, it's very good and the rewatching of the film is quite the joy ride.  However, don't be fooled.  When one thinks of dreams one might think of the odd dreams that someone has when they believe they are captured by alien space monkeys and delivered to the Queen of Bananas.  This is not that type of dream.  In fact, they argue it away by mentioning that the more reality shifts and bends, the more the subconscious is aware that it is dreaming.  At that point, the Inception or even extraction can't take place.  Words aside, all of it is explained in the film, if you have the attention span to pay attention.A great film, well put together, and an original concept that is very often not seen in any kind of entertainment.  It is not based off of an original work other than itself and it is, therefore, even more genius.  With powerhouse actors like DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, and Ken Watanabe it's hard not to be immediately engaged.  The ending, too, is a rather perfect finale that sums up the entire piece with perfect ease.  Is it recommended?  Absolutely.

I skipped going to see it in theaters because most of the time I am let down when something is overly hyped. So like I do with a lot I waited until the DVD release to finally catch this film. I must say that I am glad I waited and let the hype factor die down because I did enjoy this movie. I also will say that if I had been paying attention and realized Cillian Murphy was in this I may have went and seen it on the big screen.If you have yet to see this I can assure you that what you have heard is true, you do have to follow what is going on the whole time [kinda]. Well at least at first but once you know the rules the film is playing by it becomes easier to guess what is coming. The film starts out with our Dream robbers inside the mind of a man who will become one of the center parts of this story. When we learn that you can be in a dream inside a dream things start to heat up. But once out the question is asked ""can you plant an idea in some one's mind like you can steal info from them"". This question is pressed by the man they just tried to steal from and he offers the thieves a job. So the plan starts to be laid out as a team is assembled to do what most think is impossible.Written and directed wonderfully by Christopher Nolan this movie combines elements of other films and styles to create a very intriguing world. The effects and twists of the story keep you interested the entire time, and it is a long film. Take for example the building of the dream, when you see what ""the human mind"" can come up with and all the things it can add to these worlds are amazing. Visually this film is near flawless but there are other factors that bring it down. Such as when you figure out the film, you figure it out, sure the twists are there but you can kinda guess what is coming.And while the film takes a while it does and some great actors keeping things going, one of my favorites Cillian Murphy is the mark in this movie. Of course lead Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job here as does Ken Watanabe who is actually a favorite in the film as he did a great job. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as well was great as Leo's number one guy, Marion Cotillard was excellent as Leo's wife in this movie, Ellen Page as the dream weaver, Tom Hardy was another wonderful addition to the film, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Dileep Rao all did great jobs as well.

It's true that the movie presents some mysteries to be resolved (which Nolan does quite well) in addition to some of the most thrilling action scenes in recent cinema, but Nolan takes great pains to make the plot easy to follow.  The elaborate plans made by the team are simplified for the audience through the characters' strategy sessions, and when simultaneous actions are taking place on different levels, the use of entirely different settings for each level make it extremely easy to follow the abrupt shifts.  Why anyone would find this puzzling is...well, quite puzzling.Go see this movie...you'll be glad you did.  I'm not a big Leo fan, but he (along with the rest of the cast) did an outstanding job.

1305053,A2BPDFR58H9575,B002ZG980U,Galina,"[3, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Inception (2010) is a brilliant film - intelligent, exciting and dazzling. When the award season comes, and it is not nominated for editing, screenplay, music, cinematography, set decoration, art direction, and directing by Nolan, I'll be very surprised. Nolan is highly talented as both director and writer and should be recognized for the amazing achievement which his new film is. By the words of writer/director, ""the key to completing the script was wondering what would happen if several people shared the same dream... Once you remove the privacy, you've created an infinite number of alternative universes in which people can meaningfully interact, with validity, with weight, with dramatic consequences."" Inception feels like The Matrix on steroids with the impossible structures of M.C Escher coming to life, with some ideas shared with Solaris and the short stories by Jorge Luis Borges such as The Circular Ruins and The Secret Miracle, and with the script that would do honor to Charlie Kaufman. In my dream world, I want Nolan and Kaufman work together and I would love to stay in the alternative reality they'd create. I would not mind the totem top spinning endlessly advising me that I am in the dream world of Nolan's and Kaufman's imagination. As it is, the film is a great entertainment, the real feast for brains, senses and feelings. There are so many references to the studies of the most mysterious stage of human brain, dream state, specifically, lucid dream. There are the nods everywhere to the previous films, mythology archetypes, literature and art works. I found particularly touching the use of the Edith Piaf's song, Non, je ne regrette rien and casting as one of the main characters of the film Marion Cottilard, the 2008 Oscar winner for playing Edith Piaf. Acting in the film is pleasure all around, starting with Leonardo Di Caprio (Hey, someone give him an Oscar already) as an expert in stealing the ideas out of the human brains in the lucid dream state, who has to perform the opposite task of inception the idea in someone's brain. Everyone was memorable and well-cast including Joseph Gordon-Levitt whom I like in every film I've seen him, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, and already mentioned Cottilard. My favorite performance is by Ellen Page as Ariadne - what a fitting and appropriate name for the Architect of the dream world's sets and mazes and the guide inside the labyrinth just like her mythological namesake princess on the island of Crete. With all its complexity, reality within dreams, many layers of subconscious, projection and manifestation of the dreams, three or even more states of dreams all played off each other and communicating with each other and the wake state, the film in its core tells a very simple story about one man's burning desire to go home to these whom he loved the most but couldn't be with. It is about love, guilt, creating and living the dream, and finally letting it go. It is an action thriller sc-fi heist that simultaneously plays in four or even more different level of subconscious but with the real feelings and emotions. It is spectacular. It is the best Christopher Nolan's film I've seen and in the very end of his film he wants us to acknowledge that everything we saw has been designed by him. He is the architect of all layers of dream. We are in his dream and that's why the totem keeps spinning and never stops as the screen turns black.",5,As the totem top spins...,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,3503,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Inception', '2010', 'brilliant', 'film', 'intelligent', 'exciting', 'dazzling', 'When', 'award', 'season', 'not', 'nominated', 'editing', 'screenplay', 'music', 'cinematography', 'set', 'decoration', 'art', 'direction', 'directing', 'Nolan', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'surprised', 'Nolan', 'highly', 'talented', 'director', 'writer', 'should', 'be', 'recognized', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'new', 'film', 'words', 'writer/director', 'key', 'completing', 'script', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'several', 'people', 'shared', 'same', 'dream', 'Once', 'remove', 'privacy', ""'ve"", 'created', 'infinite', 'number', 'alternative', 'universes', 'people', 'can', 'meaningfully', 'interact', 'validity', 'weight', 'dramatic', 'consequences', 'Inception', 'feels', 'Matrix', 'steroids', 'impossible', 'structures', 'M.C', 'Escher', 'coming', 'life', 'ideas', 'shared', 'Solaris', 'short', 'stories', 'Jorge', 'Luis', 'Borges', 'such', 'Circular', 'Ruins', 'Secret', 'Miracle', 'script', 'would', 'do', 'honor', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'dream', 'world', 'want', 'Nolan', 'Kaufman', 'work', 'together', 'would', 'love', 'stay', 'alternative', 'reality', ""'d"", 'create', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'totem', 'top', 'spinning', 'endlessly', 'advising', 'am', 'dream', 'world', 'Nolan', 'Kaufman', 'imagination', 'film', 'great', 'entertainment', 'real', 'feast', 'brains', 'senses', 'feelings', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'references', 'studies', 'most', 'mysterious', 'stage', 'human', 'brain', 'dream', 'state', 'specifically', 'lucid', 'dream', 'are', 'nods', 'everywhere', 'previous', 'films', 'mythology', 'archetypes', 'literature', 'art', 'works', 'found', 'particularly', 'touching', 'use', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'song', 'Non', 'je', 'ne', 'regrette', 'rien', 'casting', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'Marion', 'Cottilard', '2008', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'playing', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'Acting', 'film', 'pleasure', 'around', 'starting', 'Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'Hey', 'someone', 'give', 'Oscar', 'already', 'expert', 'stealing', 'ideas', 'human', 'brains', 'lucid', 'dream', 'state', 'who', 'perform', 'opposite', 'task', 'inception', 'idea', 'someone', 'brain', 'Everyone', 'was', 'memorable', 'well-cast', 'including', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'whom', 'like', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Cottilard', 'favorite', 'performance', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Ariadne', 'what', 'fitting', 'appropriate', 'name', 'Architect', 'dream', 'world', 'sets', 'mazes', 'guide', 'labyrinth', 'just', 'mythological', 'namesake', 'princess', 'island', 'Crete', 'complexity', 'reality', 'dreams', 'many', 'layers', 'subconscious', 'projection', 'manifestation', 'dreams', 'three', 'even', 'more', 'states', 'dreams', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'communicating', 'other', 'wake', 'state', 'film', 'core', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'burning', 'desire', 'go', 'home', 'whom', 'loved', 'most', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'love', 'guilt', 'creating', 'living', 'dream', 'finally', 'letting', 'go', 'action', 'thriller', 'sc-fi', 'heist', 'simultaneously', 'four', 'even', 'more', 'different', 'level', 'subconscious', 'real', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'spectacular', 'best', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'acknowledge', 'everything', 'saw', 'been', 'designed', 'architect', 'layers', 'dream', 'are', 'dream', 'why', 'totem', 'spinning', 'never', 'stops', 'screen', 'black']",N/A

The movie was complicated and required a lot of close attention and concentration. The story was dreaming and dreams within dreams. I ended up confused early on and it didn't get much better. The movie was interestingly done, however.I had trouble with the sound. It was one of these movies which relies strongly on surround sound and I don't have a surround-sound system. My sound system is stereo and it's quite good. I'd guess that most people's TV is only stereo, either as a system or as the sound of the TV set. Well, in this particular case a lot of the film's conversation was meant to come through the side speakers and it would probably be highly effective in a large theater. But I don't have side speakers and I get all my sound out of the front speakers. The engineering of this sound track was not suited with my sound system and the majority of people would probably have the same difficulty. I've run into this problem with several other DVDs but this one was particularly difficult. Another thing is that this movie has a highly-praised musical score, and I can understand. It's quite good. The problem is that the music doesn't enhance the movie. It interferes with the movie, in my opinion.""Inception"" is loaded with a lot of interesting special effects including spectacular explosions which are probably meant to coincide with the dream theme. Some are very dramatic and are tied in with a major burst of sound for the sound system. Every once in a while, I'd have to decrease the sound in order not to disturb the neighbors.In any case, I had a lot of difficulties in watching this film. I feel that I would have to watch it over again, perhaps several times, to give it a proper evaluation. The problem is, I didn't find the film interesting enough to watch over again. I have others that I would far prefer to watch a second time. My patience on this film became somewhat exhausted. One final note. ""Inception"" is a 2010 movie and I'm not used to finding movies this new on the bargain rack and in such abundance. That's probably trying to say something.Gary Peterson",3,Dreamy. Complex.

I'm not going to bother describing the story. Any short description wouldn't do justice to how well put together and nuanced the story is, any long discussion would spoil moments without need.Suffice it to say, the themes of the movie (on my rendering, at least) are how humans influence each other, and an exploration of the hazy epistemic boundaries between dreams and experience. Leonardo Dicaprio has come a long way since Titanic.  Here, he's a true star in every sense of the word: he holds this multi-hundred-million dollar movie together through his emoting, and his struggles are who the audience follows throughout the movie.  Ironically, however, I found myself more drawn to the unknown-to-me Joeseph Gordon-Levitt, who is perhaps given the film's best role in the point man who has to navigate a dream where the rules of physics have gone completely awry. After Inception, I watched 500 days of Summer, and with the experience of both of these films in my mind, I declared Levitt my favorite actor recently. The stunts he pulls in Inception are quite simply amazing, and even the Blu-Ray's breakdown of how they were composed does nothing to fade my admiration. These two are pretty much headliners of a cast of incredibly talented people, including Michael Caine and the beautiful Marion Cotillard.Behind the scenes, however, we always sense the hand of Christopher Nolan, whose themes existential anxiety continue from the Dark Knight and Memento. Some of the shots in this movie are second to none, and that is effort not owed to actors or setup crew, this is brilliance at the writing and production stage.  Even the first scene, of Leonardo Dicaprio lying on a beach, soaking wet as waves crash, is absolutely gorgeous. It's realistic, gritty, but at the same time, it's more gorgeous to me than anything seen in say, Avatar or The Matrix. Delve deeper into the lore of the movie and you'll realize that musically it's brilliant too, the sound of Edith Piaf slowed down and altered into a leitmotif that sounds deep and imposing.Such a collaboration of exceptional actors, filmmakers, and writers truly deserves to be seen.

1305068,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002ZG980U,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","Christopher Nolan has already created a niche in cinematic history with the few in number but huge in impact films he has made. What Nolan manages to do with his storytelling is request, no, insist that his audience thinks - and that is such a change from the usual fare on the screens these days.  His 'MEMENTO' is as intellectually dynamic as his more traditional in content 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'BATMAN BEGINS', 'INSOMNIA' and 'PRESTIGE' are in spectacular use of the cinema as an art form.  He takes all that one step further with 'INCEPTION', a strangely very personal inquiry into the world of our dreams, aided by a story that challenges us to stay with him through 148 minutes of tension and special effects used as no other director to date has dared.The plot is so thick and seemingly fragmented at times that even Nolan has been said that he didn't always know where the ideas were born. Essentially it is about dream invasion, a futuristic concept that by entering the dreams of competitors or opponents, possibilities/ideas/truths can be found in one of the most startling permutations of  identity theft yet described: if dreams can be entered and examined and altered then many things can be changed by the 'dream thief'.  The cast is absolutely remarkable - actors who can take an idea so strange and pull the audience with them through an experience that can be at times challenging to follow.  Leonardo DiCaprio, growing with each film he makes, is joined by his troops Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy to explore the minds/alterable dreams of Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Pete Pete Postlethwaite.  Along the way of this venture DiCaprio must cope with his encounters with his wife of the past, Marion Cotillard.  Oh, and throw in Michael Caine as DiCaprio's father to flesh out a truly stellar cast.It is a fascinating ride, and though there are portions that seems to go on too long (the episodes in the snow, the loss of gravity in the elevator shaft, etc), the film is truly unique.  it would probably be well to see it twice: the first time for the astonishing affect it has on the viewer, the second time to better appreciate all the little clues dropped along the way that would make the story more accessible.

1305069,ATYVBUA5E1IDW,B002ZG980U,Graham,"[3, 6]","The power of an idea. Just as Christopher Nolan's latest epic centers around this concept, so too does this review. Inception is a completely new and original idea - no small feat in a Hollywood overflowing with sequels, reboots, and retreads. Over the past fifteen years, Nolan has proven himself to be a fine director blessed with the ability to craft epic thrillers with no shortage of intelligence, style, and technical virtuosity. Much was made over 2008's The Dark Knight and rightly so, but with Inception, Nolan has upped the ante in nearly every regard. This review will be extremely light on plot details as I firmly believe one should go into the theater with as little knowledge as possible - the experience of discovery is so great, that to take that away, even just a small amount, would be a cinematic travesty. I, for one, won't be the reviewer to do it. So if you must know all about the events that fill Inception's 2.5 hour run time, look elsewhere.There is so much that I could mention here that it's difficult to know where to start: the technical wizardry on display in nearly every frame, Hans Zimmer's bombastic score, and the murderer's row of acting talent all merit their own discussion. However, I must start by describing, in broad strokes only, the concept of Inception and how this complicated film springs forth from such a universal act - the act of dreaming. This is one of Nolan's many masterstrokes throughout the film. By creating a world in which perhaps 80% of what we see takes place in various dreamworlds, Nolan has captured the imagination of everyone. This is not The Matrix or eXistenZ, there is no computer knowledge or enthusiasm required; everyone dreams, and therefore every single member of the audience is able to live out various scenes of the film, because we know many of these rules. Do you ever remember the beginning of a dream? No. All of a sudden you are right in the middle of it. And how often do you wake up right as the killer is closing in or the bullets begin to tear through your chest? These are basic concepts ripped from the dreams of all the people in the world and then woven into a narrative so deep and complex that it makes The Prestige (Nolan's other masterpiece) seem as complicated as a Care Bears episode.So yes, Inception is a complex film, but that doesn't mean that's it's inaccessible or overly complicated. Far from it, in fact. Those who simply wish to see a glossy heist movie will not be disappointed, just as those in search of something far deeper will leave the theater happily shaking their heads at the sheer enormity and ambition of Christopher Nolan's vision. This is the ultimate thinking man's blockbuster. It is filled to the brim with magnificent action set-pieces including a zero-gravity fight in a hallway and an assault on a snow-covered hospital fortress, both of which must be seen to be believed. The academy might as well send the best special effects and art direction statues right over to the Warner Brothers lot, as both categories should be a lock after the insane display put on by Nolan and his talented crew. It's an enormous task to translate dreams to the big screen, but Inception passes every test with flying colors. This is a beautiful movie, just as The Prestige and both Batman films before it.I also must mention Hans Zimmer's score. Rumor has it that Nolan would not permit Zimmer to see the film as he wrote the score, and this only enhances the impact of Zimmer's deep and booming music. Not since Up and The Dark Knight, have I been this impacted by a film score. The music adds the perfect amount of grandiosity and emotion to the proceedings. Nowhere is this more apparent than the film's climax, a gut-wrenching finale that assaults the senses on every conceivable level.Finally, I must mention the terrific ensemble cast of Inception. Utilizing many actors he has worked with before, Christopher Nolan has brought together what is arguable the greatest cast in years and there is not a dud in the bunch. Leonardo Dicaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, and the list goes on. It's an astonishing collection of talent, each of whom is utilized perfectly. There is no filler here; no characters written simply to take up space. Everyone has a part to play and the actors fill these roles perfectly. Dicaprio once again proves that there is no one better working in Hollywood today. He has come a long way since his Titanic days, and just as in Shutter Island, he commands the screen with such vigor and intelligence that it's impossible not to identify with the guy.Watanabe and Murphy, both villains in Nolan's Batman Begins again prove that they can absolutely command the screen whenever they want. Watanabe is an absolute marvel here, the guy's gaze could back down a pack of hungry wolves, I swear. Ellen Page continues to move away from her Juno persona and into young-Jodie Foster-territory and Marion Cotillard nails one of the most difficult roles in the film, portraying a figure both sympathetic and terrifying without seeming to break a sweat. Caine's role is not much more than a cameo, but damn he's good. I really don't know what else to say about Michael Caine, he just adds such gravitas to any film he lends his name to.That being said, in my mind this movie really belongs to two actors: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy. Both are young up-and-comers in the film world, and I'll be damned if this movie doesn't launch both to stardom. JGL has come a long way since his 3rd Rock from the Sun days, exhibiting the confidence and charm of a young Brad Pitt with the range to match. His zero-g hallway fight is a sight to behold and throughout the film, Gordon-Levitt exhibits a cool factor that would be unmatched ... if it weren't for Tom Hardy. Previously confined largely to British cinema and thus unseen and unappreciated in the states, Hardy exploded onto the scene with last year's Bronson and continues his ascent with a wise-cracking bad-ass role which he tears into with unabashed enthusiasm. Hardy was a crowd favorite at the screening I attended and I dare you to feel any different. The man simply oozes charisma and he possesses the physicality necessary for any role. Indeed, he will next be seen in the remake of The Road Warrior, and as much as I detest remakes, this one will be on my radar for one simple reason: Tom Hardy.If you haven't figured it out by now, let me spell it out for you. I love this movie. As I left the theater I was struck by a sensation very rare for the jaded would-be film critic: pure and genuine excitement. I couldn't get Inception out of my head all night long and when I woke up the next morning, it was the first thing to enter my mind. I simply can not give any greater recommendation than that. Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself this time around. Inception is a masterpiece, plain and simple.

Saito is a mysterious and super powerful business figure that can erase a criminal record and fix it so Cobb can return to the US with just a phone call.  and he's got a helicopter. and he can kill people with impunity.  but, he can't break up a rival company except through this convoluted scheme?  you can almost hear the Mission Impossible music.so the setup is that it is highly dangerous and almost impossible... but, there it is a second later.  it is that kind of smooth glossy logic that makes Inception kind of corny.  the idea that a dream can happen within a dream is a marvel!  Saito says, ""Impressive.""  then, Cobb wants to do a 3 layer dream.  oooooh!  no way!  oh, wait, no problem.  seems like the Yusuf, the chemist that creates the drug to put people in a dream, has been doing it for a while.  all the protests of the dangers and complications of a 3 layer dream are washed away.  but, wait, it gets better!  by the end of the film, you are in a 5 layer dream!  that's impossible, you say???  nah, it's no problem.  so, the sense of danger of doing any multilayer dream is really just glossed over.  and any profound complexity is just adding another layer of dreams.how is it like matrix?  well, how do you know when you're in a dream?  this is the Brain-in-a-vat question.  turns out Cobb and his wife had created their ""perfect"" world for fifty years (Cobb the architect and his wife, the oracle... ha! it's a stretch but, i went there.)  there's even a ""training session"" of Juno much like Morpheus taking Neo thru training simulations of the real matrix.  the sub-conscious is represented by the people in the dreams and they act much like agents when they sense something foreign in the dream.all throughout the movie, Nolan wants to put in that cliche personal layer.  what about Cobb's wife and his kids?  well, turns out Cobb's wife got lost in the dreams, so he ""put in"" the idea that she was in a dream.  she escapes by killing herself in the dream - thus waking up in the real world. (unlike the matrix, if you die in the dream, you don't die in real life.)  problem is, the idea is still there so she still thinks she's in another layer of dreams.  she can't recognize reality any longer... or is it reality???  ah, the ending is ambiguous and cliche.  Nolan wants to leave you spinning on that question.at this point, if you've kept up, you either really cared deeply or like me, you've just wasted two hours (+ half an hour writing this review).  i didn't find any likable characters, just a series of annoying ones (Juno is the worst by the way).  found most of the ideas derivative and not really developed - hey, Nolan, if you're going to challenge us with all the hype, please deliver.  and the action could have been pulled from any other generic action movie.i've read some of the other reviews that give this movie 5 stars, but, i think it's safe to say that i am in disagreement.btw, i really like Matrix.  if you couch a simple idea with coolness and martial arts, i'll go along for the ride.  just do it well... do it well,

1305072,A10NSJ3UY0X0E0,B002ZG980U,Graydon G Frenzel,"[0, 0]","Christopher Nolan directs one of the most mind bending films I have ever seen, literally. It follows a skilled extractor Cobb(Leonardo DiCaprio) who infiltrates a wealthy, incipient heir's dreams to complete what is thought to be an impossible task. A harrowing ordeal, running around people's dreams,but he must do so to regain his ability to reenter the U.S. to get his old life back. The storyline of the movie is extremely complex and if I spoiled the ending it would have no meaning unless someone knew how the cast ended up there.  Nolan keeps the audience guessing by skewing what we understand to be a dream, reality, dreams without reality, and the perception of a dream and real time. He does so by using the idea that we never really know when or where a dream begins. Roger Ebert gave a great quote in his review for this film, explaining how the audience can relate to this film stating that ""We are always in the Now. We have made some notes while getting here, but we are not quite sure where here is."" I have never seen anything like this film it is wholesomely original and those looking for something new will enjoy it. If the movie itself in theaters was not enough, now on DVD there is a load of interesting Special Features. The Extraction Mode: which goes through how Nolan, DiCaprio and, the crew designed the films setting and key moments. The feature I enjoyed the most was the one that everyone can relate to, Dreams: Cinema of the Subconscious. Everyone dreams, and the idea that our dreams can be a functioning parallel reality is extremely interesting. I give this film 4/5 stars. Looking for more information on the film?

1305076,A5SC9O8TZJ6DK,B002ZG980U,Gregory William Locke,"[0, 3]","Set for a November 2010 release, Terrence Malick's long gestating The Tree of Life, starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, is our pick for the year's big Oscar film. The details of the production have been kept as secret as any major production ever, word slipping here and there that the film is the product of nearly three decades of writing by Malick. The production is said to be huge and the post-production as labored-over as any. All that said, we at ScreenTime refuse to believe that Tree's production will match that of the just released new Christopher Nolan film, Inception, surely another big Oscar film.Where to begin? Inception, Nolan's seventh proper feature, is the British-American auteur's biggest, strangest, most promoted, most anticipated and most memorable work yet. Opening this past weekend at No. 1 with over $60 million in US sales, I left the theater wondering three things about the dreamy heist flick: 1) how many people in the theater with me were able to follow not just the bombastic action, but the delicate storyline?; 2)  How the f%#@ do you write something like that?; and 3) which of ScreenTime's favorite directors saw this film? Malick? Tarantino? Scorcese? Spielberg?! What did they think of it? This, I'd love to know.I wasn't alive when Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi epic 2001: A Space Odyssey was released, but I can still watch it today and feel its power and originality, every time wondering how it made Kubrick's contemporaries feel. My guess is that it made them all realize that they needed to think harder and work harder. Even if your name is Spielberg and you made an epic production called Saving Private Ryan, Inception likely has a similar 2001 effect on you. More than Star Wars in 1977 or Avatar just last year, Inception just feels bigger, grander, more labored over and ""next level"" than anything of recent memory. Films likes Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Tarantino's original Kill Bill cut, Nolan's own The Dark Knight and even Malick's own The Thin Red Line are humbled by the mastery and creativity of Inception.That said, Inception is not the best film of 2010. Not in our book. It may be the best made film of 2010, but a better film, Jacques Audiard's Un Prophete, has already been released and there are a couple coming yet (Tree, mostly), that stand to be better. After such a rant about the brilliance of Inception, how can I already say such a thing? Well, many reasons. For starters, Inception is an often tedious film. Using a chopped-up non-linear storytelling device, Nolan has made an extraordinarily cerebral caper film that's dressed up as a big summer blockbuster. There's enough action to make Sly Stallone blush, which is cool, but there's also an awful lot of important dialogue. You have to hear every word in the film so much so that, in fact, if you simply sneeze at the wrong parts of the film, you'll miss something that could maybe spoil your complete understanding of what's going on. (Tedious is the word I keep coming back to, even if I'm uncomfortable using such a negative word to describe such a masterful work.) If you've not yet seen the movie, imagine sitting in a theater for 150 minutes, paying close attention to every word and movement, never more than a 10 second break for a joke or two. Plan to walk out of the theater with a fried brain, dropped jaw and crossed eyes.But hey, let's not knock an artist for being wildly ambitious. We're cool with Inception frying our brain. And, aside from that, we have very few issues with the movie. Sure, the setup (basically, these dudes gotta crack into this younger dude's dreams and plant an idea in this his mind before he turns his dad's company into a Wal-Mart-like monster) is incredibly underbaked compared to what follows, but that's no big deal. And the casting, aside from Marion Cotillard (who is perfect), seems a bit off, Leonardo DiCaprio's Dom Cobb seeming a bit too similarly played to his recent Shutter Island character, Teddy Daniels. The still-very-young-feeling Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the mature daddy of the operation? And Ellen Page as the big brain who makes things happen? Ummm.Now let's focus on the good things. First and foremost is the writing, which is brilliant. People who write as well as Nolan usually write long, details novels - and Inception could've easily been a mini-series. But Nolan thinks equally in movement and vision, and we're the luckier for it. His writing, especially in Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight, has always been impressive, but here he makes his mark. The amount of detail and thought put into this puzzle of a story is mind-blowing. Look for Nolan to grab an Oscar nomination - and maybe statue - for his original screenplay. No. 2 on the list of things Inception does impossibly well is editing. You have to see it twice to believe it. Telling a story like this on paper is hard enough, but taking moving pictures of it, adding sound and music and CGI, then cutting it all up non-linear-style and making sense of it is the hardest part of the process.  Editor Lee Smith, known mostly for his work with Peter Weir, will win 2010's Oscar for Best Editing. He should've won it in 2008 for The Dark Knight, in 2006 for The Prestige and maybe even in 2005 for Batman Begins, but he will win it in 2010.There's much more to say about the tedious but brilliant, visually inventive yet action-packed new Christopher Nolan movie, but let's not get carried away. It's just a movie. It's just the movie that deserves all of the attention Avatar received last year but won't (this because it makes you think too hard). It's just the movie that (fingers crossed) might change the way Hollywood studios treat big brain artists with big ideas. For a while, anyhow. And we have Christopher Nolan and his brilliant new sci-fi mindbender to thank.",5,An Epic Script and Production,1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,5837,"['Set', 'November', '2010', 'release', 'Terrence',

The movie asks you to pay attention, and to think, and the ending is of the sort you have to give some thought to--unless, unlike most people you were right on top of everything, all the way through, and you read the credits at the end...At its essence, ""Inception"" is a heist film, with DiCaprio and gang entering people's dreams to get the secrets that will allow them to steal stuff.  Then, a client asks them to implant an idea in someone else's dream.  In theory that can't be done, but DiCaprio has had some experience both ways, as it turns out, and it has been creating problems for him all through the film... which means there's a story within the story, about a dream within a dream.  The film is visually stunning to begin with, and I should have seen it on the big screen.  As you probably already know, the film then takes its setting and folds it in on itself, so Paris is not just Paris, but Paris facing our way, with another part of Paris upside down above us, and cars driving right up the streets that now rise like walls.  And, things fall apart, whole cities, rooms, everything, as the dreams collapse when they get unstable.  It's like Matrix action meets James Bond scenery, so now it's not only the characters who are flitting about mindless of gravity, so is the landscape.  And then, when the subconscious begins to feel that you're messing with the dream, they--the projections of the dreamer's subconscious, come after you, and that really cheapens the film.When the movie gets to its main focus, the Inception--inserting the idea into the Industrialist's dream--they have to go down into three levels of his dreaming, each one occupying exponentially more time than the one above.  What do they find?  That he's been trained for this moment, and that his subconscious is fully armed and ready to fight back.  Yawn.  You'd think in a grand cinematic adventure of the mind like this one, when you get that far into someone's head you'd find an old fling, some deep secrets;  a lost fantasy world?  Something really interesting?  No.  All we get is a mainline Hollywood big budget shoot 'em up.  Oh well.  It's a hole in the film, but the film doesn't fall apart because of it.My first viewing went by like a fast trip on a train in a driving rain--I had to guess what was going on most of the time, so I offer the following tips:Pay Attention to:1) The Rules--they come early, and are simple and clear and don't change.2) Notice who is actually doing the dreaming for any sequence--they have to stay awake in the dream, when everyone else goes to the next level--this can get confusing.3) The Rules about the time spans of each level of the dream within a dream.4) The spinning top, and where it stops spinning.If you can manage that, you'll come to the end much more prepared.I very much enjoyed the film and look forward to watching it again, and probably more times after that.",3,They Went Down Down Down And Found An Action Film,1302220800,"04 8, 2011",2011,3011,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'ending', 'sucks', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'Ignore', 'movie', 'pay', 'attention', 'think', 'ending', 'sort', 'have', 'give', 'thought', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'right', 'top', 'everything', 'way', 'read', 'credits', 'end', 'essence', 'Inception', 'heist', 'film', 'DiCaprio', 'gang', 'entering', 'people', 'dreams', 'get', 'secrets', 'will', 'allow', 'steal', 'stuff', 'Then', 'client', 'implant', 'idea', 'someone', 'else', 'dream', 'theory', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'DiCaprio', 'had', 'experience', 'ways', 'out', 'been', 'creating', 'problems', 'film', 'story', 'story', 'dream', 'dream', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'begin', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'film', 'then', 'setting', 'folds', 'so', 'Paris', 'not', 'just', 'Paris', 'Paris', 'facing', 'way', 'part', 'Paris', 'upside', 'down', 'cars', 'driving', 'right', 'streets', 'now', 'rise', 'walls', 'things', 'fall', 'apart', 'whole', 'cities', 'rooms', 'everything', 'dreams', 'collapse', 'when', 'get', 'unstable', 'Matrix', 'action', 'meets', 'James', 'Bond', 'scenery', 'so', 'now', 'not', 'only', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'flitting', 'mindless', 'gravity', 'so', 'landscape', 'then', 'when', 'subconscious', 'begins', 'feel', ""'re"", 'messing', 'dream', 'projections', 'dreamer', 'subconscious', 'come', 'really', 'film.When', 'movie', 'main', 'focus', 'Inception', 'inserting', 'idea', 'Industrialist', 'dream', 'have', 'go', 'down', 'three', 'levels', 'dreaming', 'one', 'occupying', 'exponentially', 'more', 'time', 'one', 'above', 'What', 'do', 'find', 'been', 'trained', 'moment', 'subconscious', 'fully', 'armed', 'ready', 'fight', 'back', 'Yawn', ""'d"", 'think', 'grand', 'cinematic', 'adventure', 'mind', 'one', 'when', 'get', 'far', 'someone', 'head', ""'d"", 'find', 'old', 'fling', 'deep', 'secrets', 'lost', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Something', 'really', 'interesting', 'No', 'get', 'mainline', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'budget', 'shoot', 'up', 'Oh', 'well', 'hole', 'film', 'film', ""n't"", 'fall', 'apart', 'it.My', 'first', 'viewing', 'went', 'fast', 'trip', 'train', 'driving', 'rain', 'had', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'most', 'time', 'so', 'offer', 'following', 'tips', 'Pay', 'Attention', 'to:1', 'Rules', 'come', 'early', 'are', 'simple', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'change.2', 'Notice', 'who', 'actually', 'doing', 'dreaming', 'sequence', 'have', 'stay', 'awake', 'dream', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'next', 'level', 'can', 'get', 'confusing.3', 'Rules', 'time', 'spans', 'level', 'dream', 'dream.4', 'spinning', 'top', 'where', 'can', 'manage', ""'ll"", 'come', 'end', 'much', 'more', 'prepared.I', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'again', 'probably', 'more', 'times']",N/A

1305095,A16CZRQL23NOIW,B002ZG980U,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[3, 4]","Chris Nolan is -step by step- the most innovator, defying and risky of the actual generation of North American filmmakers. This audacious project seems to confirm it .Sleep is unquestionably a ""dangerous"" condition, from the biological perspective; it's to say a Box of Pandora who suddenly may be waken up, switching off the array of defense mechanisms, exposing it with all its fragile vulnerability in order to be shaped or forged.Dom Cobb (Leonardo Di Caprio in lifetime role until this date) is a specialist in what concerns to permeate the frontiers of the subconscious and so, being capable to steal ideas of other people during the dream state; he seems to be a perfect target to undertake a most hazardous mission. To plaint an idea rather than steal it. This bold plan will allow him to recover part of his missing existence. But at the meantime he will have to face other big challenges of the enemy in this puzzling game of interests and strategies all the way through.The film carves in relief and brings us back the old romantic notion of the imagination and two worlds, night world and day world. And so, the psyche is the basic pillar of the whole drama. The psyche is far to be what supposedly we mean by unconscious. The psyche -in its perpetual evolution- makes intelligible statements being able to erect new hidden connections, unthinkable projects, dreams, moods, desirable worlds or unbearable environments. I cannot stop to think in the famous short tale of Jorge Luis Borges titled ""The memory of Shakespeare"" in which the owner of this gift has a crown of thorns in his head and only can be saved when other people asks him why he has this arrange crown. Once you have asked this question, the crown goes to your head and you will have to wait for weeks, months or centuries for other who asks you the same and finally it releases you from this torment.When Napoleon defined the death as a dream without dream, he was conscious or unconsciously, pointing to the core of the question. The different layers of reality in what we move, the levels of relative sanity or insanity in what we live, the powerful contradictions of  terms such passion, caprice, firm determination or relentless attitude in pursuit of something or someone, depend in last instance, of every one of us; this implies a subjective matter, obscured by the jungle of the prefixed concepts that have nothing to do with our surrounding reality. The more intelligent you are, the more you are near of leave behind what many people may regard as impossible at a first sight. When Balzac stated the bravery was just an habile calculus about the fear that struggled our adversary, one can infer the will as the main vector of our live may surmount obstacles of any sort, and so, for many this defying and even irreverent attitude may be associated with a state of dementia.Nolan takes advantage of this script and exposes several lines of behavior around the chaser and victim and shows us they are not so distant like it seemed at fist sight.It would be convenient not forget that this fascinating issue had previously explored by Rene Clair in The beauties of the night, Bu&ntilde;uel in the Exterminator Angel,  La Jete by Chris Maker, Dodes-Kaden by Kurosawa, Gilliam in Brazil and Twelve monkeys, David Lynch in Mulholland Drive.Complex, dynamical, imaginative and fascinating film that I wouldn't hesitate as the best script in years.A must-see.",5,The most imaginative script of the year!,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,3440,"['Chris', 'Nolan', '-step', 'step-', 'most', 'innovator', 'defying', 'risky', 'actual', 'generation', 'North', 'American', 'filmmakers', 'audacious', 'project', 'confirm', 'unquestionably', 'dangerous', 'condition', 'biological', 'perspective', 'say', 'Box', 'Pandora', 'who', 'suddenly', 'may', 'be', 'waken', 'up', 'switching', 'off', 'array', 'defense', 'mechanisms', 'exposing', 'fragile', 'vulnerability', 'order', 'be', 'shaped', 'forged.Dom', 'Cobb', 'Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'lifetime', 'role', 'date', 'specialist', 'what', 'concerns', 'permeate', 'frontiers', 'subconscious', 'so', 'being', 'capable', 'steal', 'ideas', 'other', 'people', 'dream', 'state', 'be', 'perfect', 'target', 'undertake', 'most', 'hazardous', 'mission', 'plaint', 'idea', 'rather', 'steal', 'bold', 'plan', 'will', 'allow', 'recover', 'part', 'missing', 'existence', 'meantime', 'will', 'have', 'face', 'other', 'big', 'challenges', 'enemy', 'puzzling', 'game', 'interests', 'strategies', 'way', 'through.The', 'film', 'carves', 'relief', 'back', 'old', 'romantic', 'notion', 'imagination', 'two', 'worlds', 'night', 'world', 'day', 'world', 'so', 'psyche', 'basic', 'pillar', 'whole', 'drama', 'psyche', 'far', 'be', 'what', 'supposedly', 'mean', 'unconscious', 'psyche', '-in', 'perpetual', 'evolution-', 'intelligible', 'statements', 'being', 'able', 'erect', 'new', 'hidden', 'connections', 'unthinkable', 'projects', 'dreams', 'moods', 'desirable', 'worlds', 'unbearable', 'environments', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'think', 'famous', 'short', 'tale', 'Jorge', 'Luis', 'Borges', 'titled', 'memory', 'Shakespeare', 'owner', 'gift', 'crown', 'thorns', 'head', 'only', 'can', 'be', 'saved', 'when', 'other', 'people', 'asks', 'why', 'arrange', 'crown', 'Once', 'have', 'asked', 'question', 'crown', 'head', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'weeks', 'months', 'centuries', 'other', 'who', 'same', 'finally', 'torment.When', 'Napoleon', 'defined', 'death', 'dream', 'dream', 'was', 'conscious', 'unconsciously', 'pointing', 'core', 'question', 'different', 'layers', 'reality', 'what', 'move', 'levels', 'relative', 'sanity', 'insanity', 'what', 'live', 'powerful', 'contradictions', 'terms', 'such', 'passion', 'caprice', 'firm', 'determination', 'relentless', 'attitude', 'pursuit', 'something', 'someone', 'depend', 'last', 'instance', 'one', 'subjective', 'matter', 'obscured', 'jungle', 'prefixed', 'concepts', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'surrounding', 'reality', 'more', 'intelligent', 'are', 'more', 'are', 'leave', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'may', 'regard', 'impossible', 'first', 'sight', 'When', 'Balzac', 'stated', 'bravery', 'was', 'just', 'habile', 'calculus', 'fear', 'struggled', 'adversary', 'one', 'can', 'infer', 'will', 'main', 'vector', 'live', 'may', 'surmount', 'obstacles', 'sort', 'so', 'many', 'defying', 'even', 'irreverent', 'attitude', 'may', 'be', 'associated', 'state', 'dementia.Nolan', 'advantage', 'script', 'several', 'lines', 'behavior', 'chaser', 'victim', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'seemed', 'fist', 'sight.It', 'would', 'be', 'convenient', 'not', 'forget', 'fascinating', 'issue', 'had', 'previously', 'explored', 'Rene', 'Clair', 'beauties', 'night', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'Exterminator', 'Angel', 'La', 'Jete', 'Chris', 'Maker', 'Dodes-Kaden', 'Kurosawa', 'Gilliam', 'Brazil', 'Twelve', 'monkeys', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Mulholland', 'Drive.Complex', 'dynamical', 'imaginative', 'fascinating', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'best', 'script', 'years.A', 'must-see']",N/A

Inception actually gives the movie a bit of a nod by naming one of its central characters Mal (pronounced ""Mol"" in the film). But that's where the similarities end.

Or even Tron and Tron Legacy? And then there was The 13th Floor, where the reality had a boundary, and the characters could see it.Inception brought the concept to another level and made each reality affect the other like a domino. If you believe in karma, then you can see the direct results of cause and effect, layer upon layer. The director makes you think, makes you pay attention and dares you to blink - because, if you do, you probably will lose it all and get totally confused. De Caprio, as usual, does a good job out of fleshing out his character, but what the heck I'm a de Caprio fan anyway. But I suspect, when he was peddling his skills about subconscious extraction, he was trying very hard to keep a straight face...The great intercuts and fast editing keep the audience on its toes; the glass-shattering soundtrack (listen to those giant French horns!) is only matched by that in Tron Legacy, but where storyline goes, Inception comes up tops. You need a really solid sound system with great bass to really enjoy this!One beef: I got the BD, DVD, Digital Copy combo, and I suspect the engineers deliberately produced a DVD of lesser quality just to show off the quality of the Blue Ray. When playing the DVD, the banding on my tv was totally unacceptable.

After seeing so many remakes, Inception is one you have NEVER seen before.  It is the idea of hacking into someone's dream to either extract one of their ideas or a piece of knowledge or to implant one.  There are layers of dreams, and it is a trick to get back out of them.  A team of specialists lead by Leonardo Dicaprio tries to enter the dreams of a corporate executive to implant an idea, but there is nothing easy about it.  This is a multi-layered story with subplots and even multi-layered dreams!There are movies whose plots can be written on a cocktail napkin.  This is not one of them.  It took my seeing it twice before I really grasped everything going on.  I love movies that really make you think and don't hand you all the answers on a silver platter.

I hate Sci/Fi.And what even made me more suspicious is that one of my friends have seen it and ""hated"" it. I quote ""couldn't even finish the movie"" due to the unclear completely confusing story line.I have to admit that all of the above made me put this movie off for a while, even If I've already bought the DVD but another friend of mine was urging me on watching it because as yet I quote again ""It's SOOOO Good and a must see"" that I had to satisfy my curiosity and given in........and I'm glad I did !This movie wasn't just ""good"" it was brilliant ! Fantastic and totally Awesome ! Seriously, probably the best Sci/Fi movie I've ever seen and the most fun film I've enjoyed like really enjoyed in a long time and that's coming from someone who doesn't normally watch Sci/Fi.Usually when I watch a movie, I either skip some parts, let the movie play on my DVD while I do other things like doing a project, assignment or read an article or whatever. Sometimes I would leave the movie playing while I do other things and sometimes I would ""Pause"" the movie and return to seeing it at other times.  This movie However had a gratifying effect on me, it just made me totally glued to the chair, there were parts in it where I was wondering How did they do that ? Especially the part when they were floating in the air was pretty cool and I haven't been wondering about this kind of stuff since I was in primary school.I think the major problem for this movie is that some people may not understand the plot line and I don't blame them, I mean the plot is kinda complicated and hard to get into unless you're paying a close attention you'll probably get that facial expression on your face that says ""Whaaaaat ????"" or ""Ehhhh, I don't get this"".That's why for the sake of understanding the movie, I'd recommend you do as I did. Turn the lights off, remove any element of distracting, don't get busy doing anything else or you won't understand the movie. Stay in a quite nice corner and just relax and watch the film. See if you won't understand it, never ""pause"" unless you have to.The filmography was amazing ! The directing was cool, the scenes beautifully made all the virtual stuff are awesome too. The acting fantastic and the premise is Original and creative and completely interesting.I would recommend this film to every Sci/Fi lover, and if you don't like Sci/Fi I would recommend you give this movie a try you might like it.

1305118,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B002ZG980U,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 7]","You will recognize at once the various matrices that have produced this film. The first matrix is of course that of all sorts of king fu and other action films that deal with real and virtual worlds intertwined into a more or less loose fabric. This one is simple to identify and follow, if follow we want to or can.The second matrix is naturally ""Matrix"", the film or rather trilogy of films. In Matrix though the three levels of reality are the underground warriors who fight against the conquest of the world by machines, the real world and the world of machines. A fourth level exist which is the result of the matrix itself: the real world of the surface is little by little conquered by a mental world ""controlled"" or ""invaded"" by a certain Mr. Smith. This mental world is the creation of some engineer behind who invented the mathematical matrix that enables his mind to take over the real world.None of this here. In fact we have a real team of people who are exploiting a certain capability of some human beings, themselves among others, their ability to dream and to be able to live (virtually of course) in that dreamed world. That dreaming can be controlled by some machine and is like hypnosis. The complication comes from the fact that anyone in any world can dream a deeper world that then superimposes itself onto the original world. We thus can come to five, six or seven levels of depth. This is done so fast that, and since we are constantly jumping from one level to the next, the film becomes chaotic.The human mind is afraid and abhors chaos. So in front of this situation we are confronted to we try to sort out the various levels and to remember which one is the first true dream, hence which one is the real world, and hence which ones are the other and deeper worlds. Don't believe in miracles. You would have to be autistic to be able to really follow every shift from one world to the next and identify them in their depth and successiveness. And that's the charm of the film. A certain balance and equilibrium is then re-established at the end when finally - but I won't say - though we have absolutely no real element to make sure that last scene is the real world.At another level of meaning this film, as opposed to ""Matrix"", has no reference or metaphor connected to any Christian myth, or as for that any mythology at all. The film then has no ethical meaning, no spiritual signification, no mental and moral depth. We are thus and henceforth floating and roaming into a vast universe of many strata with no milestone, guideline or compass to find a way out. This world is absolutely psychotic and after a period of living in that universe the characters would find it a relief to finally die. But is it that simple?If you died in the first level of dreaming that would wake you up in the real world. But if you died in any deeper world you will never be able to wake up in the real world, hence you would die really. The fact that suffering at any level accumulates in the real person whose personae or avatars are suffering at any dreamed level makes the experience really painful for the real persons. The psychosis would easily then induce this person to just accept to die, to commit suicide.The last characteristics of this film is that the main character has the capability to bring into any of his dreamed world the recollection of his wife who is really dead, or so he says, and she can play a direct role against him including enticing him to commit suicide in order to stay with her. Here the psychosis can reach a certain level of schizophrenia.This film then is a pure strong disorienting drug that aims at getting you out of any kind of stable vision of reality. That's what the title means and that's what the objective of the real people in the real world is: to implant ideas in the brains of other people to control them and to make them do what they want them to do, in other words to manipulate them. IN-ception is nothing but a manipulation of words like RE-ception, PER-ception, DE-ception, and many others: CON-ception, EX-ception, .... In a way it is a denunciation of the virtual universe or universes of electronic games now game-designers have been able to introduce us into their virtual reality just as if we were really in that universe made real in the process. All that is false and fake but quite a few people find it comfortable to live in such a psychotic reality, and for some of them to die there.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,No escape from virtual psychosis,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,4602,"['will', 'recognize', 'once', 'various', 'matrices', 'have', 'produced', 'film', 'first', 'matrix', 'course', 'sorts', 'king', 'fu', 'other', 'action', 'films', 'deal', 'real', 'virtual', 'worlds', 'intertwined', 'more', 'less', 'loose', 'fabric', 'one', 'simple', 'identify', 'follow', 'follow', 'want', 'can.The', 'second', 'matrix', 'naturally', 'Matrix', 'film', 'rather', 'trilogy', 'films', 'Matrix', 'three', 'levels', 'reality', 'are', 'underground', 'warriors', 'who', 'fight', 'conquest', 'world', 'machines', 'real', 'world', 'world', 'machines', 'fourth', 'level', 'exist', 'result', 'matrix', 'real', 'world', 'surface', 'little', 'little', 'conquered', 'mental', 'world', 'controlled', 'invaded', 'certain', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'mental', 'world', 'creation', 'engineer', 'who', 'invented', 'mathematical', 'matrix', 'mind', 'take', 'over', 'real', 'world.None', 'here', 'fact', 'have', 'real', 'team', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'exploiting', 'certain', 'capability', 'human', 'beings', 'others', 'ability', 'dream', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'virtually', 'course', 'dreamed', 'world', 'dreaming', 'can', 'be', 'controlled', 'machine', 'like', 'hypnosis', 'complication', 'fact', 'anyone', 'world', 'can', 'dream', 'deeper', 'world', 'then', 'original', 'world', 'thus', 'can', 'come', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'levels', 'depth', 'done', 'so', 'fast', 'are', 'constantly', 'jumping', 'one', 'level', 'next', 'film', 'chaotic.The', 'human', 'mind', 'afraid', 'abhors', 'chaos', 'So', 'front', 'situation', 'are', 'confronted', 'try', 'sort', 'out', 'various', 'levels', 'remember', 'one', 'first', 'true', 'dream', 'hence', 'one', 'real', 'world', 'hence', 'ones', 'are', 'other', 'deeper', 'worlds', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'miracles', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'autistic', 'be', 'able', 'really', 'follow', 'shift', 'one', 'world', 'next', 'identify', 'depth', 'successiveness', 'charm', 'film', 'certain', 'balance', 'equilibrium', 'then', 're-established', 'end', 'when', 'finally', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'absolutely', 'real', 'element', 'make', 'sure', 'last', 'scene', 'real', 'world.At', 'level', 'meaning', 'film', 'opposed', 'Matrix', 'reference', 'metaphor', 'connected', 'Christian', 'myth', 'mythology', 'film', 'then', 'ethical', 'meaning', 'spiritual', 'signification', 'mental', 'moral', 'depth', 'are', 'thus', 'henceforth', 'floating', 'roaming', 'vast', 'universe', 'many', 'strata', 'milestone', 'guideline', 'compass', 'find', 'way', 'out', 'world', 'absolutely', 'psychotic', 'period', 'living', 'characters', 'would', 'find', 'relief', 'finally', 'die', 'simple', 'died', 'first', 'level', 'dreaming', 'would', 'wake', 'up', 'real', 'world', 'died', 'deeper', 'world', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'wake', 'up', 'real', 'world', 'hence', 'would', 'die', 'really', 'fact', 'suffering', 'level', 'accumulates', 'real', 'person', 'personae', 'avatars', 'are', 'suffering', 'dreamed', 'level', 'experience', 'really', 'painful', 'real', 'persons', 'psychosis', 'would', 'easily', 'then', 'induce', 'person', 'just', 'accept', 'die', 'commit', 'suicide.The', 'last', 'characteristics', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'capability', 'bring', 'dreamed', 'world', 'recollection', 'wife', 'who', 'really', 'dead', 'so', 'can', 'play', 'direct', 'role', 'including', 'enticing', 'commit', 'suicide', 'order', 'stay', 'Here', 'psychosis', 'can', 'reach', 'certain', 'level', 'schizophrenia.This', 'film', 'then', 'pure', 'strong', 'disorienting', 'drug', 'getting', 'kind', 'stable', 'vision', 'reality', 'what', 'title', 'what', 'objective', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'implant', 'ideas', 'brains', 'other', 'people', 'control', 'make', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'other', 'words', 'manipulate', 'IN-ception', 'nothing', 'manipulation', 'words', 'RE-ception', 'PER-ception', 'DE-ception', 'many', 'others', 'CON-ception', 'EX-ception', 'way', 'denunciation', 'virtual', 'universe', 'universes', 'electronic', 'games', 'now', 'game-designers', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'introduce', 'virtual', 'reality', 'just', 'were', 'really', 'universe', 'made', 'real', 'process', 'false', 'fake', 'few', 'people', 'find', 'comfortable', 'live', 'such', 'psychotic', 'reality', 'die', 'there.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

1305124,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B002ZG980U,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[5, 7]","A film like Inception only comes along once a decade, and it's no surprise it took Writer/Director Christopher Nolan over ten years to polish the screenplay into its final form. The loud and frenetic visuals in the trailer all fall into place when you see the film, which represents a masterful blend of genres and ideas, some of which have been attempted before but never in this combination. Unlike so many Jerry Bruckheimer visual onslaughts or the recycled franchises that use continuous split-second cuts to replace plot, the major set pieces in the film leave the audience literally on the edge of their seats, and it's one of the few blockbusters in memory that can be enjoyed as both a top-notch action movie and a deeply cerebral experience.In fact, Inception is a perfect film on so many levels that it's breathtaking to watch. Apart from the technical wizardry of bringing some of the mind-bending visuals to the screen, the real triumph is in conveying its complex, layered concepts and plot lines in a way that never lectures or loses the audience and never takes a break from the action to lay down exposition. Unlike the sequels to the Matrix, where the attempt to develop the alternate reality of the first film became convoluted and ludicrous in the second and third installments, Inception has enough fresh ideas to feel like an entire trilogy perfectly woven into one coherent and gripping movie. And with a running time of 2.5 hours, it's remarkable that it never once drags or lingers on unnecessary scenes to reach the conclusion.For fans of Memento, it will seem like that film was just Nolan was warming up to getting Inception just right. Roger Ebert made an interesting observation when he said it's a film that defies spoilers, in that even if you know the ending, it's meaningless without knowing how you got there. For film-buffs and screenplay enthusiasts, the richness of the dream-within-a-dream reality and the effortless jumping between different timelines and dreamers' worlds will be studied for years. And even though the film happens primarily in dreams, Nolan avoids the temptation to use the weirdness of the the dream world just to show us something different that ultimately doesn't make sense.And yet despite the tight plotting, fastidious direction and pitch-perfect score from Hans Zimmer, it's the performances of a flawless cast that pulls the whole thing together. Leonardo DiCaprio once again shows us he's one of the finest actors working today, and any one of the supporting cast creates an Oscar-worthy performance. Amongst a remarkable cast, the real star is Marion Cotillard who, in playing the subconscious projection of Leonardo's deceased wife, is both warm and completely terrifying, and grounds the challenges of the hero to chilling effect. She provides the darkness of the theme in the same convincing way that Heath Ledger epitomized the black undertones of The Dark Knight.With Inception, Christopher Nolan underscores himself as one of the best Writer/Directors in Hollywood, and continues to develop not only his own storytelling but the capabilities of his crew, many of whom we've seen in previous films.

1305128,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B002ZG980U,Jason Bean,"[1, 2]","I'll admit I'm very mixed when it comes to Christopher Nolan's films. I loved his first film 'Following' as well as 'Batman Begins' and consider them both favorites. I liked the ideas behind 'Dark Knight' and 'Prestige' but felt Nolan was sacrificing the fun in the ideas of his films for cleverness. Inception is kind of in the middle: a science fiction thriller with great direction and fun ideas but a bit artificial in the story-telling department.The plot of Inception follows a bunch of 'mission impossible'-like thieves who have the technology to invade people's dreams and steal information. The team is led by the charismatic Cobb who has a tortured past and is hired/strung-along by shady businessman Saito to implant an idea into a rival's dreams. I loved how the people in Cobb's team are recruited, each having his or her ability in the 'dream' world (i.e. one's an architect who creates the dream world, one's a forger who can assume other identities). As the movie goes on we are introduced to more and more rules of the 'dream' world our thieves are infiltrating (how time works in different 'layers' or dream within dreams) at the same time getting more and more about Cobb's past. Unfortunately the film starts breaking it's own ""rules"" after a while and the pay-as-you-go dialogue gets so ridiculous that the experience falls apart and feels more like a blueprint than an actual movie.The cast in Inception (as with the rest of Nolan's films) is perfect. Leonardo Decaprio (in my opinion) gives his best performance to date as the lead-thief Cobb. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is reason enough to see any film and (in my opinion) steals every scene he's in. Ellen Paige is a good choice as the every-person for whom we see most things from and get alot about how the dream technology works. Ken Watanabe is great as Saito and Tom Hardy is given a fun character who can assume other people's identities in dreams.Another great thing about Inception is the visuals. While Christopher Nolan's screenplay is filled with too much exposition, the sheer imagination put into the set designs and action scenes is breathtaking. Buildings fold, characters walk on a never-ending staircase, and the gunfights (particularly the one in zero gravity) and chase scenes are slick as can be. You really have to see it to get how neat it is.I obviously wouldn't call 'Inception' best film I've ever seen. As usual I like Christopher Nolan's stories but I don't like the way he tells them. I did find 'Inception' worth watching, though if only for it's originality. With so many other movies adding up to absolute garbage it's nice that there's a director who's still thinking outside the box. I just wish he would leave some sense of wonder and imagination left to the audience.",3,Dreams.....are like Ogres....,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,2771,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'very', 'mixed', 'when', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'films', 'loved', 'first', 'film', ""'Following"", 'as', 'well', ""'Batman"", 'Begins', 'consider', 'favorites', 'liked', 'ideas', ""'Dark"", 'Knight', ""'Prestige"", 'felt', 'Nolan', 'was', 'sacrificing', 'fun', 'ideas', 'films', 'cleverness', 'Inception', 'kind', 'middle', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'great', 'direction', 'fun', 'ideas', 'bit', 'artificial', 'story-telling', 'department.The', 'plot', 'Inception', 'bunch', ""'mission"", ""impossible'-like"", 'thieves', 'who', 'have', 'technology', 'invade', 'people', 'dreams', 'steal', 'information', 'team', 'led', 'charismatic', 'Cobb', 'who', 'tortured', 'past', 'hired/strung-along', 'shady', 'businessman', 'Saito', 'implant', 'idea', 'rival', 'dreams', 'loved', 'how', 'people', 'Cobb', 'team', 'are', 'recruited', 'having', 'ability', ""'dream"", 'world', 'i.e', 'one', 'architect', 'who', 'dream', 'world', 'one', 'forger', 'who', 'can', 'assume', 'other', 'identities', 'movie', 'are', 'introduced', 'more', 'more', 'rules', ""'dream"", 'world', 'thieves', 'are', 'infiltrating', 'how', 'time', 'different', ""'layers"", 'dream', 'dreams', 'same', 'time', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'Cobb', 'past', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'breaking', 'own', 'rules', 'while', 'pay-as-you-go', 'dialogue', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'experience', 'apart', 'more', 'blueprint', 'actual', 'movie.The', 'cast', 'Inception', 'rest', 'Nolan', 'films', 'perfect', 'Leonardo', 'Decaprio', 'opinion', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'lead-thief', 'Cobb', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'reason', 'enough', 'see', 'film', 'opinion', 'steals', 'scene', 'Ellen', 'Paige', 'good', 'choice', 'every-person', 'whom', 'see', 'most', 'things', 'get', 'alot', 'how', 'dream', 'technology', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'great', 'Saito', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'given', 'fun', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'assume', 'other', 'people', 'identities', 'dreams.Another', 'great', 'thing', 'Inception', 'visuals', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'screenplay', 'filled', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'sheer', 'imagination', 'put', 'set', 'designs', 'action', 'scenes', 'breathtaking', 'Buildings', 'fold', 'characters', 'walk', 'never-ending', 'staircase', 'gunfights', 'particularly', 'one', 'zero', 'gravity', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'slick', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'have', 'see', 'get', 'how', 'neat', 'obviously', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', ""'Inception"", 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'usual', 'like', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'did', 'find', ""'Inception"", 'worth', 'watching', 'only', 'originality', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'adding', 'up', 'absolute', 'garbage', 'nice', 'director', 'who', 'still', 'thinking', 'box', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'leave', 'sense', 'wonder', 'imagination', 'left', 'audience']",N/A

You've just taken the first step into understanding the mind-influencing and reality-bending genius of Inception.Imagine you're dreaming an M.C. Escher painting.  You don't know up from down, don't know real from fake.  Now imagine someone else can control your dream, implant thoughts, influence your behavior, manipulate your beliefs.  First explored competently inDreamscapewith a young Dennis Quaid, the thought of dream control - followed closely by the real life physical, emotional, and psychological consequences of dreams - is compounded upon in level s so numerous I had to take off my shoes and socks to keep count.The basic concept: Cobb (DiCaprio) and Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) have the extraordinary ability to enter others' dreams - Sleeping Toms, if you will.  After an intensely realistic trial run, a rich businessman named Saito (Watanabe) enlists their abilities to accomplish the dangerous practice of ""inception:""  planting thoughts into another's mind through dreams.  The target is a competing businessman, Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy).  What Saito doesn't know, however, is Cobb's dangerous history with time and mortality slipping away in his dreams.  Dying in dreams.  Getting stuck in dreams.  To explain all the details or dangers of their mission would be futile, but they assemble a team of various malcontents (i.e. Tom Hardy as Eames and Dileep Rao as Yusuf) and a wunderkind (i.e. Ellen Page as Ariadne - the architect) to share a perilous multi-dimensional mission into the unpredictable nether regions of the psyche, where a person's subconscious can and will attack foreign intruders like white blood cells battle disease.Director Christopher Nolan, who previously fried synapses with Memento and The Prestige, provides yet another wholly enjoyable, spell-binding, challenging film.  The plot and the script are fabulously complex.  There's no doubt that the Deus ex machina is heavy handed at times, but a movie intending to challenge viewers to interpret reality from dream - particularly the unknowns being explored - should be given wide latitude for explanation without ruining a viewer's exposition experiences.  In and of itself, the plot is amazing.  Paired with an outstanding cast - powered by DiCaprio, probably the best actor of his generation - that receives ample, individual screen time to strut, (great supporting roles from Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, and Marion Cotillard) and we're talking Oscar territory.  Combine all that with multiple action and special effects sequences (especially a weightless frenzy of punches, kicks, and elbows that puts a few Matrix fight scenes knee-deep in molasses) that have to be seen to be believed, and the layers form quickly (except the eye-popping slo-mo scenes) into what I'll tout as film of the year, and a round-table discussion topic for Freudian psychologists for decades to come.",5,Don't think about elephants,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,2935,"['What', 'are', 'thinking', 'Elephants', 'right', ""'ve"", 'just', 'taken', 'first', 'step', 'understanding', 'mind-influencing', 'reality-bending', 'genius', 'Inception.Imagine', ""'re"", 'dreaming', 'M.C', 'Escher', 'painting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'up', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'fake', 'Now', 'imagine', 'someone', 'else', 'can', 'control', 'dream', 'implant', 'thoughts', 'influence', 'behavior', 'manipulate', 'beliefs', 'First', 'explored', 'competently', 'young', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'thought', 'dream', 'control', 'followed', 'closely', 'real', 'life', 'physical', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'consequences', 'dreams', 'compounded', 'level', 's', 'so', 'numerous', 'had', 'take', 'off', 'shoes', 'socks', 'keep', 'count.The', 'basic', 'concept', 'Cobb', 'DiCaprio', 'Arthur', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'have', 'extraordinary', 'ability', 'enter', 'others', 'dreams', 'Sleeping', 'Toms', 'will', 'intensely', 'realistic', 'trial', 'run', 'rich', 'businessman', 'named', 'Saito', 'Watanabe', 'abilities', 'accomplish', 'dangerous', 'practice', 'inception', 'planting', 'thoughts', 'mind', 'dreams', 'target', 'competing', 'businessman', 'Robert', 'Fischer', 'Jr.', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'What', 'Saito', ""n't"", 'know', 'however', 'Cobb', 'dangerous', 'history', 'time', 'mortality', 'slipping', 'away', 'dreams', 'Dying', 'dreams', 'Getting', 'stuck', 'dreams', 'explain', 'details', 'dangers', 'mission', 'would', 'be', 'futile', 'assemble', 'team', 'various', 'malcontents', 'i.e', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Eames', 'Dileep', 'Rao', 'Yusuf', 'wunderkind', 'i.e', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Ariadne', 'architect', 'share', 'perilous', 'multi-dimensional', 'mission', 'unpredictable', 'nether', 'regions', 'psyche', 'where', 'person', 'subconscious', 'can', 'will', 'attack', 'foreign', 'intruders', 'white', 'blood', 'cells', 'battle', 'disease.Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'who', 'previously', 'fried', 'synapses', 'Memento', 'Prestige', 'yet', 'wholly', 'enjoyable', 'spell-binding', 'challenging', 'film', 'plot', 'script', 'are', 'fabulously', 'complex', 'doubt', 'Deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'heavy', 'handed', 'times', 'movie', 'intending', 'challenge', 'viewers', 'interpret', 'reality', 'dream', 'particularly', 'unknowns', 'being', 'explored', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'wide', 'latitude', 'explanation', 'ruining', 'viewer', 'exposition', 'experiences', 'plot', 'amazing', 'Paired', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'powered', 'DiCaprio', 'probably', 'best', 'actor', 'generation', 'ample', 'individual', 'screen', 'time', 'strut', 'great', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Oscar', 'territory', 'Combine', 'multiple', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'sequences', 'especially', 'weightless', 'frenzy', 'punches', 'kicks', 'few', 'Matrix', 'fight', 'scenes', 'knee-deep', 'molasses', 'have', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'layers', 'form', 'quickly', 'eye-popping', 'slo-mo', 'scenes', 'what', ""'ll"", 'tout', 'film', 'year', 'round-table', 'discussion', 'topic', 'Freudian', 'psychologists', 'decades', 'come']",N/A

I did not and I will try to explain why.Inception is a joyless movie that is far more interested in the complexity of its plot than the boundless imagination it could have with its subject matter. Dreams are where anything is possible, where people can fly do things they could not do in real life. It's an experience that frees us or traps us in a new world created and only restrained by our imaginations. Inception does it's best to keep all that at bay, as it needs to to fulfill the requirements of its plot. But in being so subservient to its plot Inception also drastically under develops it's characters to the point that I really didn't care a whole lot about any of them.There is a small segment in Inception in which it glosses over its main character's backstory. That brief five minute synopsis should have been the movie.  It was a love story and a heartbreaking one at that. It would have been all emotion and all character driven. It could have played with the backdrop of dreams and been a great visual treat while staying true to the characters. Heck, it seems like a perfect Jim Cameron movie really.But that is not the kind of movie Nolan makes. Even the Dark Knight would have been bogged down by it's own complexities without the marvelous performance by Heath Ledger. The Joker  brought a character that was profoundly having fun creating as much mayhem as he could. It injected fun and intrigue to a group of rather dry characters. Inception didn't have a character like the Joker. Not one character looked like they were interested in being there. In fact early in the scheme, one snag, and all of them wanted out, but none of them seemed too upset or concerned about going forward either. The characters just obeyed what was necessary for the plot to continue on and virtually ignored most natural human reaction or emotion. This also undercut to a large degree the danger these characters were in.

There seems to be so much set up early in the film that is then never delivered on. For example, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) asks Ariadne (Ellen Page) very early on in the movie to design a labyrinth, as part of her job interview. Later in the movie she's spending a lot of time designing the labyrinth needed for their plans to manipulate Robert (Cillian Murphy)... and then at the height of the story, we never see the labyrinth, and then they're blowing it up for reasons I couldn't begin to grasp. There are many things set up in the film that simply ""disappear"" later on.In any case, it's a story that could have been a lot better. The film is visually stunning, at least early on  -- there are some cool scenes later in the film (""How did they do that???""), but seem very self-conscious. In other words they were included because they are cool. But it feels to me like one of those movies that somehow ended up in screen-writing hell and they finally just gave up.All that said, Leonardo DiCaprio was really super.

You travel to the depths of the mind as far as no movie ever traveled before, and the concept is so mind boggling that you leave with doubts about your own existance. The array of effects does not overwhelm the complexity of this film, nor does the intrusive, symphonic music of this film distract the viewer from the brainy events that take notice regardless of what is swarming.It is a considerable task to determine all the symbols and reasons before the events actually occur, and they occur at different rates of time, and also, reality is warped and at times out of reach. Without spoilers, I will say that the places you travel are disturbing, and epic.Inception requires a heavy dose of story build up, and the multi-dimensional climax is something to behold. And it takes some will of the viewer to follow along, but that is also one of Inceptions rewards: Is that it is challenging and worth the brain power you put into it.Yes, Inception travels along at its own pace, and yes it can be overwhelming at a point, but the scenes are so masterfully put together, that it works. This movie is a lavish, unforgettable puzzle. At some point, you don't care about why they are there, only about how it will come to fruition. After all, it isn't the characters you decidely care about, it is the ultimate climax of this deeply concieved movie.The ending is full of questions, but not frustratingly so. I say this with full regard of its effect, that the ending is appropriate, and should never be tampered with again.

I only watched it on my laptop, so I can't even imagine how awesome it would look on my flat screen.  That being said, I found the whole movie to be confusing, and at times, completely unrealistic and ludicrous.  Before anyone rips my head off, let me explain.  The plot was so complicated, and all over the place, that I found it hard to understand exactly what was going on.  And I can understand that this is a sci-fi movie at heart, and I love sci-fi movies, but the entire premise is so far out there (i'm talking thousands and thousands of years to even come close to what these characters are doing), that I had a hard time getting into the movie.  It is just downright impossible for someone to insert themselves into someone else's brain, and I dare say it always will be impossible.  And if it is possible one day, I doubt all it will take is to pop some ambien and connect to each other with an electrode.Even though the plot was basically ridiculous, I can see why the movie was such a hit.  Visually it is incredible.  And I think a lot of the plot was introduced solely for the purpose of ""look what I can do!""  The characters float around, walk up walls, fall from high-rises, you name it.  You could say that this is what ""The Matrix"" would have been if you switch computers for dreams.I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.  And if you haven't seen it, it is definitely worth a look.  I would also advise you to watch it alone, or at least with someone who doesn't talk during movies, at a time when you won't be interrupted.

1305151,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B002ZG980U,Jiang Xueqin,"[2, 16]","""Inception"" has elements of both ""Memento,"" which launched the whiz kid Christopher Nolan's film career, and ""The Prestige,"" which is Nolan's most complex and subtle, interesting and entertaining, cerebral and provocative achievement to date.Like ""Memento,"" ""Inception"" is concerned with how the mind works, how it chooses to gain or lose control over itself.  ""Memento"" was about memories, those crucial building blocks of our identity, and ""Inception"" is about dreams, which the movie argues is fundamental to how we think and behave.  (Extraction is about looking for locked-away memories, and inception is about implanting a small idea that then grows until like a virus it subsumes everything.)Like ""The Prestige,"" ""Inception"" is a complicated maze.  In fact, it is like the dreamworld in which it inhabits, a multi-layered maze, with no start, no exit, and no direction.  Its precious complexity, a Nolan trademark, is ultimately the film's undoing, as while the film clearly entrances it does not hold and capture, and ultimately its idea fails to implant itself:  Nolan's inception has failed.  Both ""The Machinist"" and ""Mulholland Drive"" are far more fascinating (and, I believe from a neuroscientist's point of view, accurate) meditations on dreams, dreaming, and dreamers.Why the film fails is that Nolan does not establish anything concrete in the film, meaning that the entire film feels like a concocted dream.  There is a section which is meant to be ""reality"" but the acting is so bad, the editing so fast, the plot so incredible (everything so conveniently falls into place) that it fails to anchor us, and so we just float away.  There are many contradictions (or in Nolan parlance ""paradoxes) in the film, and that's how Nolan likes it.  I think Nolan was going after the effect of having questioned everything about the film the audience now begins to question everything about their reality.But, uh, what's the point of that?There is no doubt that Nolan is one of the most talented and definitely the most cerebral of our directors today.  But there's nothing substantive or particularly intellectual about his films:  they're all just intricate and intriguing puzzles, meant to entertain and challenge the mind -- but there's just no greater meaning under the surface.  So ""The Inception"" team dig deeper and deeper into our minds, and all they see is either a vast blanket of snow or a great expansive empty ocean.The best thing about Nolan as a director is that he knows how to use good actors.

1305157,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B002ZG980U,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[5, 7]","I am contemplating my review. I really don't know where to begin except to say this movie is a work of art. Christopher Nolan is the artist and Inception is his masterpiece. I really don't see where he can go from here.I won't go into detail about the plot because it will give to much away. Essentially a man named Dom Cobb(Leonardo DiCaprio) takes one last job to plant a idea inside Robert Fischer Jr's(Cillian Murphy) mind. So he can be able to go back to the United States and be with his children. I won't tell you why he can't go back it's a big part of the plot. The story is a dark tale about dreams and reality. None of these characters are good guys after all they break into peoples minds. Still you end up liking these flawed characters and root for them. That sometimes the dream becomes our reality and you can't tell the difference. That sometimes we prefer our dreams to the real world. The ending will leave you questioning what happened and what was real and what was the dream. If you don't pay attention this movie can be hard to follow. At one point near the climax there are four different plots going at the same time.The cast and acting was superb. Besides Leo who we should all know. There's Cillian Murphy(28 days Later/Sunshine), Ken Watanabe(The Last Samurai/Batman Begins), Joseph Gordon-Levitt(3rd Rock From The Sun/The Lookout), Ellen Page(Juno/Whip It), and Tom Hardy(Layer Cake/Bronson) round out the staring cast. All of which do a great job. Though I think Watanabe, Gordon-Levitt, and Hardy were the best. Rounding out the supporting cast were Marion Cortillard(Public Enemies) and such veterans as Tom Berenger(Platoon/Sniper), Pete Postlethwaite(The Usual Suspects/Alien 3), and Michael Caine(The Quiet American/The Dark Knight). The Michael Caine only had about three minutes of work in this film if that. Tom Berenger did a wonderful job with what he had to work with.With this complex story that is hard to follow some people might think there isn't any action or suspense. They would be wrong. From the opening scene the suspense builds until the stunning climax that I think will leave you speechless.Then there's the music by Hans Zimmer(Backdraft/Crimson Tide/The Dark Knight). Virtually every score he composes for a film ends up being a great.Finally there is the the directing by Christopher Nolan. A directer who has far as I know hasn't made a bad film yet. Hell he hasn't made a average film yet. All his films are good if not great and he just keeps on getting better. From Memento to Insomnia to Batman Begins and The Prestige to finally The Dark Knight. As if he was honing his craft for this film. The film he's been working on for years. Like I said his masterpiece. He is without the doubt the best director of this past decade and it looks like he will be in this decade. Is he one of the best directors of all time. With the likes of Eastwood, Spielberg, or Kurosawa. No he's not but he's well on his way.Overall for me this is the best movie of the summer. The best movie I've seen since The Dark Knight and one of the best Films I've ever seen. This is how films should be made with great writing, amazing acting and music and wonderful directing. It's hard to find in Hollywood now a days with endless sequels, remakes, and unimaginative or original stories. It's not the first to delve into this territory. Films like Dark City and The Matix(Before the ruined it with the crappy sequels) all went in this direction but only Nolan brought it to reality. If there is truly one movie to see this summer Inception is it. I am going to see it multiple times.",5,A work of Art.,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,3617,"['am', 'contemplating', 'review', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'say', 'movie', 'work', 'art', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'artist', 'Inception', 'masterpiece', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'here.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'plot', 'will', 'give', 'much', 'away', 'Essentially', 'man', 'named', 'Dom', 'Cobb', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'plant', 'idea', 'Robert', 'Fischer', 'Jr', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'mind', 'can', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'back', 'United', 'States', 'be', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'big', 'part', 'plot', 'story', 'dark', 'tale', 'dreams', 'reality', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'break', 'peoples', 'minds', 'Still', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'flawed', 'characters', 'root', 'dream', 'reality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'prefer', 'dreams', 'real', 'world', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'questioning', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'was', 'dream', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'follow', 'one', 'point', 'climax', 'are', 'four', 'different', 'plots', 'going', 'same', 'time.The', 'cast', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Leo', 'who', 'should', 'know', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', '28', 'days', 'Later/Sunshine', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Last', 'Samurai/Batman', 'Begins', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', '3rd', 'Rock', 'Sun/The', 'Lookout', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Juno/Whip', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Layer', 'Cake/Bronson', 'round', 'out', 'staring', 'cast', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'think', 'Watanabe', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Hardy', 'were', 'best', 'Rounding', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'Marion', 'Cortillard', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'such', 'veterans', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Platoon/Sniper', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'Usual', 'Suspects/Alien', '3', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Quiet', 'American/The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'only', 'had', 'three', 'minutes', 'work', 'film', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'with.With', 'complex', 'story', 'hard', 'follow', 'people', 'might', 'think', ""n't"", 'action', 'suspense', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'opening', 'scene', 'suspense', 'stunning', 'climax', 'think', 'will', 'leave', 'speechless.Then', 'music', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'Backdraft/Crimson', 'Tide/The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Virtually', 'score', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'great.Finally', 'directing', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'A', 'directer', 'who', 'far', 'know', ""n't"", 'made', 'bad', 'film', 'yet', 'Hell', ""n't"", 'made', 'average', 'film', 'yet', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'just', 'keeps', 'getting', 'better', 'Memento', 'Insomnia', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Prestige', 'finally', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'honing', 'craft', 'film', 'film', 'been', 'working', 'years', 'said', 'masterpiece', 'doubt', 'best', 'director', 'past', 'decade', 'will', 'be', 'decade', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'time', 'likes', 'Eastwood', 'Spielberg', 'Kurosawa', 'not', 'well', 'way.Overall', 'best', 'movie', 'summer', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'one', 'best', 'Films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'how', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'great', 'writing', 'amazing', 'acting', 'music', 'wonderful', 'directing', 'hard', 'find', 'Hollywood', 'now', 'days', 'endless', 'sequels', 'remakes', 'unimaginative', 'original', 'stories', 'not', 'first', 'delve', 'territory', 'Films', 'Dark', 'City', 'Matix', 'ruined', 'crappy', 'sequels', 'went', 'direction', 'only', 'Nolan', 'brought', 'reality', 'truly', 'one', 'movie', 'see', 'summer', 'Inception', 'am', 'going', 'see', 'multiple', 'times']",N/A

1305162,A2COOX4KVTZ4WJ,B002ZG980U,"John Blow ""batman1989""","[14, 41]","I'm an open-minded cinephile; but this film is a re-hash of movies and Tv shows that have already covered the same ground.  Dream-space, Existenz, Paprika, Star Trek's The Menagerie, Total Recall, Alias, Doctor Who, etc.  Right now people are on a Nolan kick so that means anything he does is automatically gold, but this film will be the reverse of Blade Runner -- it will enjoy immense popular acclaim and then be reviled fifty years from now.  I've heard all the popular defenses of this movie:  ""You didn't get it,"" ""it was too complex for you,"" for people who actually didn't like this film.  The fact is this movie aspires to be an artsy, thinking man's sci-fi film, but in the end it offers no new philosophy that better writers and directors haven't offered before.  The structure is derivative; the themes are derivative; the obligatory faux-ambiguous ending is derivative.  When you are working in the genre of sci-fi, and you are trying to craft an artsy sci-fi film, you had better be aware of all the other products out there, and offer some type of philosophy of your own, or yours won't stand the test of time.There is nothing here that Clarke, Bradbury, Ballard, Ellison, Chris Carter, DC Fontana and many others haven't explored before.  To suggest the world is all a dream is a theme as old as time itself, and to suggest that parts of one's consciousness might be lost in separate realities or dreams within dreams is derivative as well.  Even the visual language of this film has been capitalized on in other films, everything from the moving buildings, to the presence of an infinite regression -- Nolan has managed to lift his iconography and pastiche these from other movies, without offering any conclusion of his own.  It's the difference between a teacher who can explain Kant's ""Critique of Pure Reason"" versus a philosopher who calls into question the validity of Kant's argument.  Nolan is so content being a teacher that he doesn't even care about whether or not he agrees with observations he is reciting.I read one article where the film critic justified the movie as a comment on the dream nature of cinema itself (duh!) and argued that Nolan's blatant plagiarism was to be excused on the grounds that dreams themselves are the products of blatant plagiarism (or pilfering from reality).  While I admire the immense thought that went into his defense, I disagree with the idea that self-reflexivity makes or somehow elevates a film.  ""Rear Window"" is a masterpiece of suspense despite its allusions to the act of film-going.  It's a deeper movie when you consider how Hitchcock is implicating us in the voyeuristic process, but that alone doesn't make it a masterpiece.  Furthermore, any filmmaker who were to make a movie with the same implications would be seen as re-hashing an observation already made by Hitchcock.  ""Inception"" is not the first to address the nature of dreaming, and the manner in which it addresses it is ultimately derivative and conservative in nature.In the end, ""Inception"" is a tepid, conservative, safe, and derivative movie about dreams, made for American audiences who are not tough on their filmmakers (there is a reason Inception has suffered with foreign audiences who have seen much more creative fair), to make them feel all tingly all over.

People are put in various dream states and strata or levels of dream conditions. One is Limbo, and in one dream state you can never get out and can be trapped there forever. One person's subconscious directs another person who may be the architect of the dream world or the inceptor. Sound like a lot of gobbledegook? Well, it may well be.Leonardo Di Caprio is the lead inceptor, but he is a poor one, because he's too wrapped up in his wife's death, a death he may have caused by putting her in a dream state in which she killed herself. An elevator in a dream takes him down to a beach site, and his reality dreaming conflicts with the mission he is supposed to be conducting. He keeps seeing his dead wife over and over. Get it?There's a lot of action, a great deal of destruction of buildings and street scenes created by computer enhanced technology, something we're getting way too much of in movies these days.Michael Caine has a cameo role in the film. Di Caprio assembles a team to go with him on his dream missions. It reminds me of other team movies like Munich or Mission Impossible or Topkapi. A leading member of the teams is Eames, a very athletic guy, actor Tom Hardy, who is able to defy gravity and walk up walls and on ceilings. Di Caprio is this sci-fi action thriller is a crook who doesn't steal objects; he steals ideas from people's minds and dreams.It's an interesting premise, but the producers should practice the principle of KISS which is Keep it Simple, Stupid, so moviegoers can more readily follow this type of dream creation. Di Caprio is very earnest in it, but I'm not sure he has figured out the plot either.There are interesting visuals, some good special effects, some unique dream sequences, and good cinematography.

1305167,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B002ZG980U,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[6, 8]","""What's the most resilient parasite? An Idea. A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules.""And with that premise comes Inception- the latest slice of psychological brilliance from director Christopher Nolan to hit the theaters.  It's a well-layered, dynamically intriguing landscape of a story that absolutely seizes your attention. In this near-future vision of the world Dream Share Technology is a high-end field of both private enterprise and corporate espionage, so much so that CEO's and the like are often trained to resist it.The movie opens with Cobb (DiCaprio), an Extractor- who makes his living stealing people's secrets from their minds while they're dreaming.  He and his team had been hired to enter the mind of Saito (Ken Watanabe), but the job is disrupted by Mal (Marion Cotillard), the ghost of Cobb's late wife who haunts his own psyche, forcing them to hide from their employer.  But unbeknownst to them Saito was also auditioning them for his own purposes: he wants them to perform not an extraction but an 'inception'- planting an idea within someone's mind- on a business rival, Fischer (Cillian Murphy).  The trick of an inception is in making the subject believe they conceived it themselves, otherwise their subconscious will reject it.  The concept of an inception is extremely radical and considered only a theory, but Cobb knows it can be done... because he's done it before.  Once.Time is also a factor as a subconscious mind will eventually perceive the intruders and attack them relentlessly.  Success demands extreme skills and delicate navigation of the subject's psyche.  Cobb and Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) the Point Man, who researches their targets, recruit associates old and new- Eames (Tom Hardy) is the Forger, who can assume a specific identity within the dream; Ariadne (Page) is the Architect, who constructs the dreamscape to fit the team's needs; Yusuf (Dileep Rao) is the Chemist, who supplies the drugs needed to keep them all in the dream state.  Saito also accompanies them into the dream as they all have specific roles to fill once within Fischer's mind.  It's very much a Matrix version of Mission Impossible with some Dark City thrown in.To both complete the mission and escape successfully they must create a dream within the dream- a very unstable platform- taking them even deeper within Fischer's mind to manipulate him.  But the sins of the past continue to haunt Cobb as Mal reappears yet again to sabotage their plan and steals Fischer for her own purposes.The sub-plot and character arcs are equally compelling: Cobb's relationship with Mal is critical to the story, driving him to extremes that put everyone at risk, as well as giving Saito the leverage he needs to push Cobb into accepting the assignment.  The genius of Nolan's script is the fact that the opening quote lies at the core of the entire film.Characterizations were brilliant as well: having never been a fan of Dicaprio I am after seeing this movie.  Page did good work as DiCaprio's character foil- both providing the audience's viewpoint and juxtaposing his dilemma.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy played off each other well as men with opposing personalities.  The special effects were amazing; the visuals wholly appropriate to a dream reality.  Even the soundtrack was effective; Zimmer's synth, horn and percussion arrangements complimented the on-screen action perfectly.  If there's one- and only one- real complaint here is that it's too long; clocking in at 2  hours, there were several places where cuts could have been made and trimmed a good twenty minutes off without missing a trick.  Other than that this is a helluva mind scramble, and reminds you of just how good movies can be.",5,Insidiously Intriguing,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,3794,"['What', 'most', 'resilient', 'parasite', 'Idea', 'single', 'idea', 'human', 'mind', 'can', 'build', 'cities', 'idea', 'can', 'transform', 'world', 'rewrite', 'rules', 'premise', 'Inception-', 'latest', 'slice', 'psychological', 'brilliance', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'hit', 'theaters', 'well-layered', 'dynamically', 'intriguing', 'landscape', 'story', 'absolutely', 'attention', 'near-future', 'vision', 'world', 'Dream', 'Share', 'Technology', 'high-end', 'field', 'private', 'enterprise', 'corporate', 'espionage', 'so', 'much', 'CEO', 'like', 'are', 'often', 'trained', 'resist', 'it.The', 'movie', 'Cobb', 'DiCaprio', 'Extractor-', 'who', 'living', 'stealing', 'people', 'secrets', 'minds', ""'re"", 'dreaming', 'team', 'had', 'been', 'hired', 'enter', 'mind', 'Saito', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'job', 'disrupted', 'Mal', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'ghost', 'Cobb', 'late', 'wife', 'who', 'own', 'psyche', 'forcing', 'hide', 'employer', 'unbeknownst', 'Saito', 'was', 'also', 'auditioning', 'own', 'purposes', 'perform', 'not', 'extraction', ""'inception'-"", 'planting', 'idea', 'someone', 'mind-', 'business', 'rival', 'Fischer', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'trick', 'inception', 'making', 'subject', 'believe', 'conceived', 'otherwise', 'subconscious', 'will', 'reject', 'concept', 'inception', 'extremely', 'radical', 'considered', 'only', 'theory', 'Cobb', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'done', 'Once.Time', 'also', 'factor', 'subconscious', 'mind', 'will', 'eventually', 'perceive', 'intruders', 'attack', 'relentlessly', 'Success', 'extreme', 'skills', 'delicate', 'navigation', 'subject', 'psyche', 'Cobb', 'Arthur', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Point', 'Man', 'who', 'targets', 'recruit', 'associates', 'old', 'new-', 'Eames', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Forger', 'who', 'can', 'assume', 'specific', 'identity', 'dream', 'Ariadne', 'Page', 'Architect', 'who', 'dreamscape', 'fit', 'team', 'needs', 'Yusuf', 'Dileep', 'Rao', 'Chemist', 'who', 'drugs', 'needed', 'keep', 'dream', 'state', 'Saito', 'also', 'dream', 'have', 'specific', 'roles', 'fill', 'once', 'Fischer', 'mind', 'very', 'much', 'Matrix', 'version', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Dark', 'City', 'thrown', 'in.To', 'complete', 'mission', 'escape', 'successfully', 'must', 'create', 'dream', 'dream-', 'very', 'unstable', 'platform-', 'taking', 'even', 'deeper', 'Fischer', 'mind', 'manipulate', 'sins', 'past', 'continue', 'haunt', 'Cobb', 'Mal', 'yet', 'again', 'sabotage', 'plan', 'steals', 'Fischer', 'own', 'purposes.The', 'sub-plot', 'character', 'arcs', 'are', 'equally', 'compelling', 'Cobb', 'relationship', 'Mal', 'critical', 'story', 'driving', 'extremes', 'put', 'everyone', 'risk', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'Saito', 'leverage', 'push', 'Cobb', 'accepting', 'assignment', 'genius', 'Nolan', 'script', 'fact', 'opening', 'quote', 'core', 'entire', 'film.Characterizations', 'were', 'brilliant', 'well', 'having', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Dicaprio', 'am', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Page', 'did', 'good', 'work', 'DiCaprio', 'character', 'foil-', 'providing', 'audience', 'viewpoint', 'juxtaposing', 'dilemma', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'well', 'men', 'opposing', 'personalities', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'wholly', 'appropriate', 'dream', 'reality', 'Even', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'effective', 'Zimmer', 'synth', 'horn', 'percussion', 'arrangements', 'complimented', 'on-screen', 'action', 'perfectly', 'one-', 'only', 'one-', 'real', 'complaint', 'here', 'too', 'long', 'clocking', '2', 'hours', 'were', 'several', 'places', 'where', 'cuts', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'trimmed', 'good', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'missing', 'trick', 'Other', 'helluva', 'mind', 'scramble', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'movies', 'can', 'be']",N/A
1305168,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B002ZG980U,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[3, 6]","***This review may contain spoilers.  What it doesn't contain is a rehash of the plot.  Sorry. You'll have to look elsewhere for that.***Everyone and his Yorkshire Terrier is commenting on ""Inception"". I'll chip in my two-cent criticism as well.I viewed this movie with my friends Mark and Ron at the AMC Theater in Framingham on Flutie Pass (yes, named after Doug). All of us came out stunned. Ron thought it was the stupidest movie he had seen. Mark colorfully opined that it was some really (expletive deleted) weird (expletive deleted). I tried to be more thoughtfully diplomatic by describing what I thought the movie was trying to do. Basically, I thought ""Inception"" tried to take the ancient themes of ""What is reality, what is dream?"" and ""Is it all a dream"" into convoluted, tiered, and entertaining directions.I disagree with Mr. Ebert's assessment in his review that ""Inception"" is ""wholly original"". ""Inception"" will remind you of many other movies; for example, it obviously evoked ""Dreamscape"", ""The Matrix"", and any Bond thriller you've ever seen. But did I ""like"" it? Well, in past blogs I alluded to the concept of ""cinematic dissonance"" (which I believe should be included in Mr. Ebert's movie glossary, by the way), a simultaneous experience where your intellect regards a film as garbage while your emotions regard the film as great fun. With ""Inception"" I somewhat experienced the converse; my intellect appreciated the straight/convoluted logic of the plot while my emotions simultaneously and eventually surrendered to impatience and boredom, in spite of the phantasmagoric special effects and intense action. Well, it was late, and I am more of a morning person.Like other movies in the ""dreams/reality"" genre, ""Inception"" sucks you into deciding which exciting, involved scenario is a dream or not, even when we are apparently ""told"" which one. This ""trees at the expense of the forest"" view is, I think, meant to be beside the point. Like all good movies in this genre, ""Inception"" is saying that the basic ideas to retain are ""It's really all a dream"" and ""Reality is a subjectively chosen point on a circular continuum"". Three scenes illustrate this: 1) Ariadne shows Cobb the old ""infinite mirror"" phenomenon in the Paris construct, 2) Cobb points out Ariadne's circular maze is the proper architectural dream construct, and 3) the entire film's circular, ""this is where I came in"" structure.""Inception"" cleverly distracts us from this unsettling overall view with its noisy plot spinnings, the deceptive ""3-dimensional chess"" structure (recall Ariadnee's choice of a bronze pawn as her ""reality marker"") of the putative idea-planting plot, and the more emotionally involving dilemmas of Fischer's and Cobb's family issues. Nolan also realizes that these distractions also make the potentially alienating and disquieting notion that nothing is truly real more entertainingly palatable. In other words, we arbitrarily choose Cobb's and Fischer's situations as the reality to which we want to cling because they are at least understandable, reasonably entertaining, and diverting from the bleak ""non-reality"". Michael Caine's character underscores that with his exhortation to Cobb, ""Come back to reality"", making him, and not Cobb's top, the actual arbitrary ""reality marker"".Inception asks, ""At what point does the circle (of life) begin?"" Even though the movie gives you an ""answer"", the real answer is ""Any point you choose."" Some would say ""Inception"" demands repeated concentration. If you want to go on a metaphor and symbol scavenger hunt (and there's nothing wrong with that), go right ahead. I don't think it's strictly necessary. One viewing is enough to tell you that life is but a dream.P.S.: I think Nolan wants you to be lulled into happy closure with Cobb's ""apparent reunion"" with his children. The muted, static way that reunion scene is shot suggests otherwise. The Dream Never Dies.  Hey, what a great title for the inevitable sequel.  Also a great title for another Bond flick.",3,"It All Boils Down To ""The Dream Shall Never Die""",1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,4026,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'What', ""n't"", 'contain', 'rehash', 'plot', 'Sorry', ""'ll"", 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere', '***Everyone', 'Yorkshire', 'Terrier', 'commenting', 'Inception', ""'ll"", 'chip', 'two-cent', 'criticism', 'well.I', 'viewed', 'movie', 'friends', 'Mark', 'Ron', 'AMC', 'Theater', 'Framingham', 'Flutie', 'Pass', 'yes', 'named', 'Doug', 'came', 'out', 'stunned', 'Ron', 'thought', 'was', 'stupidest', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'Mark', 'colorfully', 'opined', 'was', 'really', 'expletive', 'deleted', 'weird', 'expletive', 'deleted', 'tried', 'be', 'more', 'thoughtfully', 'diplomatic', 'describing', 'what', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'Basically', 'thought', 'Inception', 'tried', 'take', 'ancient', 'themes', 'What', 'reality', 'what', 'dream', 'dream', 'convoluted', 'tiered', 'entertaining', 'directions.I', 'disagree', 'Mr.', 'Ebert', 'assessment', 'review', 'Inception', 'wholly', 'original', 'Inception', 'will', 'remind', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'example', 'obviously', 'evoked', 'Dreamscape', 'Matrix', 'Bond', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'did', 'Well', 'past', 'blogs', 'alluded', 'concept', 'cinematic', 'dissonance', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'Mr.', 'Ebert', 'movie', 'glossary', 'way', 'simultaneous', 'experience', 'where', 'intellect', 'film', 'garbage', 'emotions', 'regard', 'film', 'great', 'fun', 'Inception', 'somewhat', 'experienced', 'converse', 'intellect', 'appreciated', 'straight/convoluted', 'logic', 'plot', 'emotions', 'simultaneously', 'eventually', 'surrendered', 'impatience', 'boredom', 'spite', 'phantasmagoric', 'special', 'effects', 'intense', 'action', 'Well', 'was', 'late', 'am', 'more', 'morning', 'other', 'movies', 'dreams/reality', 'genre', 'Inception', 'sucks', 'deciding', 'exciting', 'involved', 'scenario', 'dream', 'not', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'apparently', 'told', 'one', 'trees', 'expense', 'forest', 'view', 'think', 'meant', 'be', 'beside', 'point', 'good', 'movies', 'genre', 'Inception', 'saying', 'basic', 'ideas', 'retain', 'are', 'really', 'dream', 'Reality', 'subjectively', 'chosen', 'point', 'circular', 'continuum', 'Three', 'scenes', 'illustrate', '1', 'Ariadne', 'Cobb', 'old', 'infinite', 'mirror', 'phenomenon', 'Paris', 'construct', '2', 'Cobb', 'out', 'Ariadne', 'circular', 'maze', 'proper', 'architectural', 'dream', 'construct', '3', 'entire', 'film', 'circular', 'where', 'came', 'structure', 'Inception', 'cleverly', 'distracts', 'unsettling', 'overall', 'view', 'noisy', 'plot', 'spinnings', 'deceptive', '3-dimensional', 'chess', 'structure', 'recall', 'Ariadnee', 'choice', 'bronze', 'pawn', 'reality', 'marker', 'putative', 'idea-planting', 'plot', 'more', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'dilemmas', 'Fischer', 'Cobb', 'family', 'issues', 'Nolan', 'also', 'distractions', 'also', 'make', 'potentially', 'alienating', 'disquieting', 'notion', 'nothing', 'truly', 'real', 'more', 'entertainingly', 'palatable', 'other', 'words', 'arbitrarily', 'choose', 'Cobb', 'Fischer', 'situations', 'reality', 'want', 'cling', 'are', 'least', 'understandable', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'diverting', 'bleak', 'non-reality', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'character', 'exhortation', 'Cobb', 'Come', 'back', 'reality', 'making', 'not', 'Cobb', 'top', 'actual', 'arbitrary', 'reality', 'marker', '.Inception', 'what', 'point', 'circle', 'life', 'begin', 'Even', 'movie', 'answer', 'real', 'answer', 'Any', 'point', 'choose', 'would', 'say', 'Inception', 'demands', 'repeated', 'concentration', 'want', 'go', 'metaphor', 'symbol', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'go', 'right', 'ahead', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'strictly', 'necessary', 'One', 'viewing', 'enough', 'tell', 'life', 'dream.P.S', 'think', 'Nolan', 'be', 'lulled', 'happy', 'closure', 'Cobb', 'apparent', 'reunion', 'children', 'muted', 'static', 'way', 'reunion', 'scene', 'shot', 'suggests', 'otherwise', 'Dream', 'Never', 'Dies', 'Hey', 'what', 'great', 'title', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'Also', 'great', 'title', 'Bond', 'flick']",N/A

Others, including some established film critics, have summed up this movie's numerous failings (and Nolan's shortcomings) far more eloquently than I will here.  I have listed a few of them below, and some of them make for quite entertaining reading, especially the ones by Edelstein and Wachtel.Had another filmmaker without Nolan's current/recent standing made this film, I believe it would have been more universally dismissed as the flawed film it is.  But Nolan seems to be getting a free pass lately, and it is not deserved.  Is the love for this film based on the film itself, or is it based on the excitement of simply getting to see another Chris Nolan film?  Think carefully before you answer.  Be honest with yourself.There's really not that much to invest in emotionally.  Leo's Dom Cobb has his motivations for barreling through all this mess, but largely I didn't care.  The special effects sure were nifty, and the concept was somewhat interesting, but I felt like the whole thing was ""forced"" and the effects and the conceit WERE the story rather than being there to serve it.  The story seems reverse-engineered, as if he had certain action setpieces and spiffy sequences he wanted to put on film and he constructed a storyline around them as padding just to have a vehicle to carry them.The primary goal of the movie's merry band of brain hackers is to implant an idea into a corporate executive's head that, if acted on, will benefit his competitor.  Thrilling, no?  Problem is, the target of the ""inception"" is a thinly-developed character who from all appearances is a decent enough fellow, so why is the audience supposed to root for the hackers to succeed against a nice guy for whom we harbor no real animosity?  There's no clear villain here, no one to root against. The only sense of urgency is a race against the clock.  It might as well be a game show.  Yep, those are the stakes in this film -- all this trouble and expense and danger just to give a Japanese businessman a competitive advantage.  Not very compelling.  The stakes are not much different than your boss telling you to ""have the report on my desk by five o'clock!""I don't dislike Nolan or his films just on principle.  I think we can all agree that ""Memento"" was a very, very good film.  But I think many of his films suffer from poor editing and poorly executed story points.  More to the point, however, I think many of Nolan's films, ""Inception"" included, aspire to the grandiose at the expense of coherence and sensible narrative flow.  Again, it is the craft of good storytelling that is the hallmark of a great director.  Nolan has shown he is capable of it, but he doesn't demonstrate it here.Is ""Inception"" multi-layered and occasionally complex?  Sure.  But layering and complexity do not make a film great.  Is it complicated and challenging in spots?  Yes, but so what?  I think it is also lazily-written in many places.  The script wiggles around and maneuvers to meet the needs of the ingredients Nolan wished to show off in the film, and it often comes at the expense of narrative sense.The immense amount of praise showered on Nolan after ""The Dark Knight"", a movie that was elevated to ""event"" status in no small part due to the untimely death and riveting performance of Heath Ledger and not necessarily because of any genius on Nolan's part, has almost made it a sacrilege to say anything less than overwhelmingly flattering about him and to almost completely insulate him from criticism, lest the critic be reviled.  Saying anything derogatory about a Nolan film is now considered ""bad manners"".  Think about that for a minute.  Are we all meant to toss objectivity out the window?  Even Roger Ebert, who liked the film, wonders if we are even allowed to dislike it in today's ""we love Nolan"" environment.I encourage you to read the following reviews of the film:David Edelstein's review for ""New York Magazine"" called ""Dream a Little Dream -- Awakening to the leaden reality of Christopher Nolan's INCEPTION"".  (*** MY FAVORITE ***)Charlie Wachtel of FilmCrusade.com  (***** MY SECOND FAVORITE *****)Stephanie Zacherek's review for MovieLine called ""Is INCEPTION This Year's Masterpiece?  Dream On.""Nick Shager's review for ""Slant Magazine"".Vadim Rizov's pre-release thoughts entitled ""God help whoever gives INCEPTION a negative review"" for IFC (website of the Independent Film Channel).Or reviews by Rex Reed of the ""New York Observer"", Harvey S. Karten, or Steven Rae of ""The Philadelphia Inquirer"".I'm not dissing this film just to fly in the face of popular opinion.  Truth is, I just didn't care for this film, and I suspect that a lot of love for this film stems from the public's recent showering of praise on Nolan for his previous films, which have NOTHING to do with this film.  Thanks to Nolan's recent successes, this film had a built-in audience predisposed to liking anything with Nolan's name on it, and for that reason perhaps they lost a bit of objectivity.  You must admit, though -- the advance trailers for the film were very well done and probably got a lot of people stoked for it.  But I don't think the film lived up to the promise.  It is layered and complex but not well-executed.I mean no disrespect to those who liked or loved the film.  If you liked it and will buy the DVD to watch over and over, then god bless ya.  Enjoy it.  I can attest that my love of certain films sometimes mystifies others.  I'm not here to tell you that you are wrong for liking this film.  I did, however, buy three other Christopher Nolan films in years past and I enjoy watching them regularly, despite the major flaws in two of those films.I'm not a ""Nolan hater"".  I just don't care for THIS Nolan film, and the reviewers I listed above managed to articulate my thoughts about this film far better than I could, so I encourage you to read those reviews -- especially the first two -- so I don't violate copyright laws by posting snippets of them here.This home video release includes both the Blu-ray AND the regular DVD.",2,I wanted to like it.

1305173,A2AVD56NK41OPE,B002ZG980U,Jonathan Stover,"[2, 2]","A gleaming, machine-tooled puzzle box of a movie which has justifiably spawned a plethora of theories about what's ""real"" in its narrative (and justifiable complaints that it didn't snag Christopher Nolan a Best Picture or Best Director nod).One's assessment of what's real hinges on one's assessment of the film's somewhat Byzantine explanation of how dreams work. Do you take at face value the ""infinite subconscious"" and the accelerated time of the dreams or don't you? Are the emblematic names of a couple of characters coincidental, aimed only at the viewer, or aimed at the ""realness"" of the dreamscape itself?Nolan's tale of a group of dream thiefs hired to implant an idea in the head of the new head of a multinational conglomerate falls down only, I suppose, in the realm of emotional depth and richness of characterization. But the actors are all so good at combining competence with a sort of post-James-Bond bitchiness that the whole affair goes down smoothly, though the James Bondian third level of the dream world bogs down a bit in pyrotechnics and too much gun-toting action.South Park accurately skewered the gobbledygook of the dream-world dynamics (Ellen Page has an occasionally thankless role as a sort of reverse-Basil Exposition, repeatedly getting DiCaprio's Cobb to explain how things work, sometimes at credibility-stretching moments). Nonetheless, the movie is a serious fun machine, and DiCaprio has really started to grow on me as an occasionally dewy eyed action hero.",4,Dream Escape,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,1500,"['gleaming', 'machine-tooled', 'puzzle', 'box', 'movie', 'justifiably', 'spawned', 'plethora', 'theories', 'what', 'real', 'narrative', 'justifiable', 'complaints', 'did', ""n't"", 'snag', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'nod', '.One', 'assessment', 'what', 'real', 'hinges', 'one', 'assessment', 'film', 'somewhat', 'Byzantine', 'explanation', 'how', 'dreams', 'work', 'Do', 'take', 'face', 'value', 'infinite', 'subconscious', 'accelerated', 'time', 'dreams', 'do', ""n't"", 'Are', 'emblematic', 'names', 'couple', 'characters', 'coincidental', 'aimed', 'only', 'viewer', 'aimed', 'realness', 'dreamscape', 'Nolan', 'tale', 'group', 'dream', 'thiefs', 'hired', 'implant', 'idea', 'head', 'new', 'head', 'multinational', 'conglomerate', 'down', 'only', 'suppose', 'realm', 'emotional', 'depth', 'richness', 'characterization', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'combining', 'competence', 'sort', 'post-James-Bond', 'bitchiness', 'whole', 'affair', 'down', 'smoothly', 'James', 'Bondian', 'third', 'level', 'dream', 'world', 'bogs', 'down', 'bit', 'pyrotechnics', 'too', 'much', 'gun-toting', 'action.South', 'Park', 'accurately', 'skewered', 'gobbledygook', 'dream-world', 'dynamics', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'occasionally', 'thankless', 'role', 'sort', 'reverse-Basil', 'Exposition', 'repeatedly', 'getting', 'DiCaprio', 'Cobb', 'explain', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'sometimes', 'credibility-stretching', 'moments', 'Nonetheless', 'movie', 'serious', 'fun', 'machine', 'DiCaprio', 'really', 'started', 'grow', 'occasionally', 'dewy', 'eyed', 'action', 'hero']",N/A

I rented this video recenty and even though I had seen the trailers I was pleasantly surprised at the story line and the overall action and even the intrigue involved.Although the concept is a dream within a dream and so on, there are a couple of stories within the overall story of what we find Leonardo Dicaprio's team is able to do.  Fascinating concept of dreaming with others, not sure if there is some overall message they are attempting to get across, but it is a rather cool concept of group dreams to manipulate the thoughts or to share the ideas of others.When thinking of the concept, I thought of the Matrix in reverse, you place yourself in an unreal world of your making, but you need others to help you build and interact with it.  I would imagine there are virtual reality sites already taking advantage of this in the world of Web 3.0.Besides the overall exciting story and time line and the action in getting the mission accomplished, the special effects are enjoyable and the methodology thought up for the dream state and getting in and out of it seemed well thought out and seemingly also without holes.  Some times there are obvious holes in a story that you find something was left unaddressed creating an inconsistency.

1305182,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B002ZG980U,Josh,"[0, 0]","Inception is one of those movies that you not only love to watch again and again (especially if you are a movie lover), but one of those films that is necessary to watch again to fully understand the concept and the detail. Christopher Nolan is my favorite director for a reason; movies like Inception hit home all the way and keep you interested and spell bound throughout the entire movie. The excellent supporting cast consists of: Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ken Watanabe, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, and Irish actor and frequent collaborator of Nolan, Cillian Murphy. Spectacular is the word used to describe each and every performance in Inception. Story line is Great and I promise that there is never a dull moment in Inception. Leonardo Dicaprio was fabulous and convincing in his performance as Cobb. Inception not only sparks the imagination to the fullest, but it leaves you in amazement and wonder even when the credits begin to roll. Inception will make you pay closer attention to detail, use your imagination, and is a sort of Asset to the ""what is real and what isnt"" or ""what you see others may not can see"" and with these examples, Inception stays on track and never loses its focus. There are those who criticize Nolan for making ""extremely long movies"" or ""movies that are too difficult to understand"". But to be quite honest that criticism is entirely unjust. Nolan has a brilliant mind and vision, and he uses it well each time he makes a movie. So with no second thoughts, I gladly give Inception:5 Stars",5,Indeed The concept is clear: A Dream within A Dream,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,1535,"['Inception', 'one', 'movies', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'especially', 'are', 'movie', 'lover', 'one', 'films', 'necessary', 'watch', 'again', 'fully', 'understand', 'concept', 'detail', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'favorite', 'director', 'reason', 'movies', 'Inception', 'hit', 'home', 'way', 'keep', 'interested', 'spell', 'bound', 'entire', 'movie', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'consists', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Irish', 'actor', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'Nolan', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Spectacular', 'word', 'used', 'describe', 'performance', 'Inception', 'Story', 'line', 'Great', 'promise', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'Inception', 'Leonardo', 'Dicaprio', 'was', 'fabulous', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Cobb', 'Inception', 'not', 'only', 'imagination', 'fullest', 'amazement', 'wonder', 'even', 'when', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', 'Inception', 'will', 'make', 'pay', 'closer', 'attention', 'detail', 'use', 'imagination', 'sort', 'Asset', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'isnt', 'what', 'see', 'others', 'may', 'not', 'can', 'see', 'examples', 'Inception', 'track', 'never', 'focus', 'are', 'who', 'criticize', 'Nolan', 'making', 'extremely', 'long', 'movies', 'movies', 'are', 'too', 'difficult', 'understand', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'criticism', 'entirely', 'unjust', 'Nolan', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'vision', 'well', 'time', 'movie', 'So', 'second', 'thoughts', 'gladly', 'give', 'Inception:5', 'Stars']",N/A
1305183,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B002ZG980U,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 7]","If any film defies a simple synopsis, it's Christopher Nolan's Inception. Few films released by major film studios are this layered, this complicated, and this well-rendered. I must admit that it took me three viewings to accept it for what a masterwork it is. Upon first seeing Inception, I questioned how it would hold up on subsequent viewings due to how much time the film spends explaining the process of inception. Turns out it holds up rather splendidly even on a third viewing.To give a synopsis in the simplest terms possible, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an extractor, a thief who steals secrets from people's minds while they're dreaming. Being the most skilled extractor, he's hired by a billionaire named Saito (Ken Watanabe) to try a different approach; inception. Saito wants Dom and his team not to steal an idea, but to plant one in the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy). While Dom and his team are skeptical, Saito gives Dom an offer he can't refuse.If there were any doubts about Nolan's brilliance as a screenwriter, this film should silence those doubts. Few screenplays are this complex, this exciting, this original, and this accessible. Nolan is a master architect of storytelling and not a scene or line of dialogue is wasted with everything absolutely essential to telling his story. While certain science-fiction elements may be recycled from other films and Cobb's relationship with his dead wife Mal (Cotillard) is similar to DiCaprio's other 2010 role in Shutter Island, it's one of the most stunningly original films of 2010. While it does spend an ample amount of time explaining the concept of both extraction and inception, once we enter Fischer's dream-world just about an hour in, the film becomes a heist movie unlikely any I've seen before.Not that anyone will find this to be unique news, but Nolan is a director of great vision who has made a film that is unlike anything I've seen before. Slow-motion is nothing new, but Nolan uses it frequently for Inception and in the most elegant ways. Nolan and his collaborators, specifically cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas, film editor Lee Smith, and the various art directors, set designers, and special effects experts involved have crafted this film perfectly. I'm not saying it's a perfect film (only time will tell), but Nolan and co. have achieved perfection with the overall look of the film. Look at each dream level as the characters pass through it; the rainy street, the beautifully-designed hotel, and the snow-covered fortress. The film was budgeted at $150 million and no expense was spared to put the vision in Nolan's head on-screen. Even the special-effects are mind-blowing, unique, and beautiful and the score by Hans Zimmer is marvelous; emotional, ominous, and highly memorable. I've always respected Nolan as a director, but there was one scene in this film that really convinced me what a visionary he is. The gravity-defying fight sequence between Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) and some dream henchmen is one of the great sequences of 2010, magnificently filmed and eloquently choreographed. It's a sequence that would make Stanley Kubrick proud and it does recall Kubrick in sheer elegance and scope.The star-studded cast also includes Ellen Page (as architect Ariadne), Tom Hardy (as identity forger Eames), Michael Caine (as Cobb's father-in-law), Dileep Rao (as Yusuf, a chemist), and the late Pete Postlethwaite (as Maurice Fischer, Robert's late father). Despite Inception falling more into the science-fiction/action genre, Nolan has said that he wanted the character's emotions to drive the film. Nolan's film may be a $150 million action extravaganza, but the emotional depth he sought was achieved through the use of a marvelous cast. The dynamic between DiCaprio and Cotillard has it's similarities to Shutter Island, but it's the driving force of the film and it works. Cotillard does a magnificent job portraying a character that exists entirely in Cobb's subconscious and DiCaprio shows that he's one of the few actors that can express emotion through the use of subtle facial features so effectively. Since Cobb spends significant time in the film experiencing a certain emotion that he's not expressing out-loud, it's up to DiCaprio to convey that emotion to both the characters around him and the audience. DiCaprio is an actor that some people don't take to very easily, but he's one of the most acclaimed living actors for a reason. Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur totally straight, but is charming none-the-less. Murphy finally gets a significant amount of screen-time in a Nolan film and shows the range that must attract Nolan to squeeze him into a film whenever he gets the chance. Finally, Nolan makes a star out of the immensely talented Tom Hardy, an actor of tremendous range who elevated a small film called Bronson into something highly memorable. Hardy plays Eames, the identity forger of Cobb's team, with smarmy, humorous wit that makes him one of the film's most memorable characters. Nolan obviously recognized this as he promptly cast Hardy in his next Batman film.The scope and magnitude of this project, whether you love it or hate it, is something to marvel over. What other director has or could make a film this complicated with intense action sequences that will excite even the most unmotivated viewer? Inception is an incredible film that only grows richer with more viewings. While it took three viewings for me to fully appreciate and come to terms with this; it's one of the best films of 2010. Intellectually-stimulating entertainment with one hell of an ending, that people will be debating and discussing for years. While a film that becomes this acclaimed and this popular so quickly will attract nay-sayers out in droves (which is fine as some people truly do not like the film), few can argue what an innovative, brilliant piece of filmmaking this is.GRADE: A",5,"An Innovative, Highly Original Film That Grows Richer with Subsequent Viewings",1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,5950,"['film', 'simple', 'synopsis',

Now 'Inception' is not your everyday kind of movie. It requires you to really think, or you'd just be lost throughout the whole movie. Usually, I'm not into films that are so complicated you can't watch it; it's as if you blink and you miss something. You have to really pay close attention to every word said, as it gives you information on what's going on. Anyway onto my review of 'Inception'.'Inception' follows Dominick 'Dom' Cobb (Played by Leonardo Decaprio) who is a professional thief committing corporate espionage by entering the mind of his target and taking their secrets. He is offered a chance of redemption as payment for one last job, doing the impossible, by entering the mind and implanting of an idea into a target's mind.The script's plot is by far one of the most complexing, and intriguing ideas I'd ever heard. Now, when we talk about originality, it means making an idea that is new, but not only that it makes sense, and isn't completely ridicules. That's the kind of original 'Inception' is.When I watched this movie, I never knew what was going to happen, everything led to something new, and then something new, and so on and so forth. This plot was beyond good that has something to-do with the script, provided by 'Christopher Nolan' who completely blew my mind at how good he is with script writing. This is one of the most beautiful scripts I've ever seen, and it's so original, maybe the idea isn't but just the way everything happens is. 'Christopher Nolan' wrote a wonderful script. Even if some of it is quit questionable, but what's a movie without plot holes right?A good script is nothing without a spot-on cast to broadcast the whole thing. And 'Inception' has quit an ensemble. 'Leonardo Decaprio' brings the heart and soul as the lead with an emotional past. Every moment he's on screen (Which is actually the whole thing) he really gets into character and provides a great leader role to the group. His journey through the film, both emotional and realistically, is compelling and sad. 'Ellen Page' is our sole female of the group, and man does she get into her role. She brings the fear that the others don't have quit she was just lovely. Plus, she came in handy, asking the questions us viewers have, and helping us along the way on this complex ride. 'Joseph Gordon-Levitt' always gives off a great performance and this movie is no different, he's charming and witty in a few scenes, and suits his role pretty well. Other solid performances come from 'Cillian Murphy', 'Ken Watanbe', and 'Marion Cotillard' playing the films targeted guy, the business man, and Dom's Wife, respectively. With Marion you never know whether her character is good, evil, crazy, or just needy. She fits into her role as if it was a snug blanket, she just gets comfy cozy in it.The editing is perfect, everything comes together perfectly and never glitches if you will. When the street starts to turn inward, not one bit of it comes off choppy. The sounds fit in where they should, and it just makes for great editing.The Visual Effects are beyond amazing, they're spectacular. Every single thing about it comes off well detailed, and thought through, it's just so beautiful. When the streets start to turn over, the details on it are amazing; the people walk on it, and the cars driving in all directions. It is just spectacular.This film features some great cinematography. I loved the camera work for inside the hotel when the gravity was turned off, it had just 'Joseph Gordon-Levitt' jumping across walls and fighting two men, I loved the different angles used for that scene, as well as during the scene with the van falling off the bridge, beautiful.The music is just what the film needed something fast paced, energetic, and smooth. 'Hans Zimmer' really gave us a wonderful score, to complement the film itself giving us something to hold onto, and excite us even more, even complex us.The set designs for the buildings, like the Chinese house, during the first act, which was a beautiful looking set. The house was beautiful and ghostly but I won't tell you why, you'll just have to wait and see for yourself.All is good, except that the film features a poor blending of pacing, switching often from fast to slow, and back again and it comes off, abit distracting. When we watch scenes between 'Marlon Cotillard' and 'Leonardo Decaprio' which are usually in-between sequences inside someone's mind, the pace is slow, and it somewhat disorientates you, as your going so fast, and then you stop for a short conversation and you're like 'Is the ride over yet'? But it's only a miner issue.All and All, 'Inception' is breathtaking feet of visuals, an original script, and some solid performances turning this into an excellent tent pole-blockbuster-popcorn film with a brain and I loved every minute of it!

Is it one of the best movies ever made?... not by a long shot.  The acting was pretty good, the story original, but for several reasons I think this is a glorified over-rated movie.  Whenever a movie seems hard to follow, which this movie is meant to be, people automatically think it is deep and complex, which classifies it as a stimulating movie.  Not the case here.  I found it rather annoying and far-fetched.  For one thing, hooking yourself up to what looks like a futuristic cappuccino machine, does not allow you to enter another person's dream.  This device is so under explained and so ridiculous, it forms a huge hole in the movie plot.  Of course if you want to turn off your brain, which 98% of people do while watching big Hollywood movies do, then you will blindly ignore this and go on believing this BS.I really thought this movie had a refreshing vibe to it in the way it explored dreams, the concept of time being warped while dreaming, the ability to control a dream environment, and the consequences of dying while dreaming.  But due to the excessive gunfights and explosions, the story became generic to me. The story also seemed to contradict itself.  First you go to a never-ending abyss by dying in a dream while being heavily sedated, but the only way you can escape the abyss is by ending your life.  This idea is vague and contradicting.  At least `The Matrix' had a much more solid concept that if you die in the Matrix, you die in reality, which was by far a much better movie.The movie's ending is cheesy and under dramatic.  Leo gets to see his children's faces.. so what? To me ""Shutter Island"" was a much better movie, which also starred Leo and also explores alternative planes of reality and has a fantastic surprising ending.  This movie's ending is predictable and obvious, leaving no twists or having the audience thinking ""Oh, now it all comes together"".",3,Much better movies out there,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,1965,"['movie', 'original', '..', 'yes', 'keep', 'attention', 'yes', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'original', 'several', 'reasons', 'think', 'glorified', 'over-rated', 'movie', 'Whenever', 'movie', 'hard', 'follow', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'people', 'automatically', 'think', 'deep', 'complex', 'stimulating', 'movie', 'Not', 'case', 'here', 'found', 'rather', 'annoying', 'far-fetched', 'one', 'thing', 'hooking', 'what', 'futuristic', 'cappuccino', 'machine', 'not', 'allow', 'enter', 'person', 'dream', 'device', 'so', 'explained', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'huge', 'hole', 'movie', 'plot', 'course', 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', '98', '%', 'people', 'do', 'watching', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'do', 'then', 'will', 'blindly', 'ignore', 'go', 'believing', 'BS.I', 'really', 'thought', 'movie', 'had', 'refreshing', 'vibe', 'way', 'explored', 'dreams', 'concept', 'time', 'being', 'warped', 'dreaming', 'ability', 'control', 'dream', 'environment', 'consequences', 'dying', 'dreaming', 'due', 'excessive', 'gunfights', 'explosions', 'story', 'became', 'generic', 'story', 'also', 'seemed', 'contradict', 'First', 'go', 'never-ending', 'abyss', 'dying', 'dream', 'being', 'heavily', 'sedated', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'escape', 'abyss', 'ending', 'life', 'idea', 'vague', 'contradicting', 'least', 'Matrix', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'solid', 'concept', 'die', 'Matrix', 'die', 'reality', 'was', 'far', 'much', 'better', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'ending', 'cheesy', 'dramatic', 'Leo', 'see', 'children', 'faces..', 'what', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'also', 'starred', 'Leo', 'also', 'alternative', 'planes', 'reality', 'fantastic', 'surprising', 'ending', 'movie', 'ending', 'predictable', 'obvious', 'leaving', 'twists', 'having', 'audience', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'now', 'together']",N/A

It really keeps your mind tuned in.  It's weird, but very, very interesting.  It is also futuristic in concept.DiCaprio is Cobb, working with the ""inception"" of dream concepts into someone's mind.  To do this, there is a network of people involved.  Someone is a architect of the actual dream, and there are several team members who also participate, beside the person being manipulated.  This is quite an operation and the variables are quite interesting and many can be unexpected.  To do the ultimate Inception, you have to go ""3 layers deep"" into the dream world - most dangerous- a dream within a dream within a dream.  Also, COBB is quite obsessed with his dead wife and constantly seeing projections of her.  He can't quite let her go emotionally, which makes it a little tough for him to stay focused. He also can't go back home to see his children because the police think he killed her.There is lots of action, car chases, and excitement.  Cool movie.

Viewing this movie left me with wobbly legs, barely able to walk the first few steps towards the door. My hands were shaking and my head ached. What a rush! I haven't had this reaction since ""Black Hawk Down"". Christopher Nolan has artfully taken the images of our subconscious nocturnal ruminations and used them as priceless fodder for his ""Inception."" Not only was I completely drawn in within the first few minutes, I felt involved.The notion of dreaming 'in conference"", as well as in layers is interesting and intelligent, but there are myriads of such ideas bouncing around in the heads of creative sorts all over the place. The fact the Nolan was able to gather the group of actors that he did and then pull it off is extremely impressive.DiCaprio as Cobb the retired 'architect' was, as usual, solid and dependable. Even more, his haunted affect in respect to his relationship with his wife, was chilling. Ellen Page, Ariadne, becomes to Cobb a sort of 'good angel' on one shoulder to his wife's (Marion Cotillard) bad angel on the other. The insinuations of ambiguity between reality and dream become a frightening proposition for Cobb, and for those of us who witness. As supporting cast, Tom Hardy, Ken Watenabe and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were icing on the cake, powerful and proficient in their parts. What a surprise to see Gordon-Levitt used as muscle! Cillian Murphy's muted performance as the passive victim was underplayed in the very best of ways.  He is certainly one brilliantly versatile actor (see 'Peacock').CGI was mind-bendingly claustrophobic in some scenes and eye candy for the ADHD advantaged in others! I'm far too ignorant about such things to comment beyond that.There have been some criticisms regarding character development and confusion regarding the role of Kobel Engineering in the dream sequences. As far as character development in concerned, when chaos abounds, there is not much time to exchange personal information or go fishing, however much you wish. This was an intense experience that I believe would have suffered from too much exposition. As to Kobel Engineering, it is important to keep track of what is in Cobb's surreality and and what isn't.""Inception"" was the movie of 2010 for me.

I was expecting to be blown away like everyone else. Unfortunately, I wasn't. The concept of this film is brilliant and fascinating. The manner in which they chose to execute it, less so. I didn't feel invested in the movie at all or connected to the characters in any way. From the beginning, the story is muddled and bogged down with the angst and personal drama of DiCaprio's character Cobb. I understand that he's the main character and that his motivations are the driving force behind the entire story. Unfortunately, therein lies my problem with this film. We are not offered any opportunity to emotionally connect with anyone other than Cobb. All of the other characters are nothing more than paper cutouts, not even quirky enough to offer the illusion of some development. We are meant to rely entirely on DiCaprio to make us care about the story. And in my case, DiCaprio is unable to garner my interest or sympathy. I've always felt that DiCaprio is overrated as an actor and this film did nothing to change my opinion of his skills. I honestly couldn't bring myself to care whether or not Cobb made it home. Also, the source of his personal trauma was fairly predictable from an early stage in the movie. Which wouldn't have been a big deal necessarily but it's unveiling is dragged out unbearably an din such a heavy handed manner that by the time it was fully 'revealed' what little interest I had in it was gone.Ellen Page's character served as the catalyst for Cobb's personal expositions...and little else. And it's not because she connected to Cobb on an emotional level or had any more depth than the other characters. It's simply because as an outsider, she offers the simplest method for exposition. She professes concern for the safety of everyone on the mission and says that she's going along in case Cobb's subconscious gets out of control. However, there is no indication whatsoever that she would be able to do anything for anyone if that happened and in fact, she never does anything more than stand around and whisper earnestly at Cobb- which has no effect whatsoever. If she had truly been concerned for everyone's safety she should've told them upfront that Cobb was a basketcase unfit to share his dreams with anyone. I suppose we're meant to assume that she's come to care about Cobb but I just don't get that from Page's performance. I feel no connection between these two characters and Page's delivery is consistently flat throughout the whole film. She has no solid character traits or motivations of her own. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character would've been a better choice to help Cobb- having known him longer and already being aware of his personal tragedy and motivations. And his acting was much better, although they certainly didn't 'waste' time developing his character at all. And what last thing about Page's character...her name. Ariadne? That's almost as bad as Bella Swann. I guess they thought they were being clever but to me it came off as ridiculous and heavy handed, especially in comparison to everyone else's mundane names. They may as well have called her Maze Guide Girl.In conclusion, this film relies far too much on one character to carry it, especially considering it's an ensemble cast. Obviously, there are many people who were able to glean more from DiCaprio and Page than I was. I imagine that would make this movie far more enjoyable. As for me, I simply waited for it to be over.",2,Underwhelming.,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,3570,"['Admittedly', 'went', 'movie', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'Everyone', 'spoke', 'raved', 'was', 'fantastic', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'everyone', 'else', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'concept', 'film', 'brilliant', 'fascinating', 'manner', 'chose', 'execute', 'less', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'invested', 'movie', 'connected', 'characters', 'way', 'beginning', 'story', 'muddled', 'bogged', 'down', 'angst', 'personal', 'drama', 'DiCaprio', 'character', 'Cobb', 'understand', 'main', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', 'driving', 'force', 'entire', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'therein', 'problem', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'offered', 'opportunity', 'emotionally', 'connect', 'anyone', 'other', 'Cobb', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'paper', 'cutouts', 'not', 'even', 'quirky', 'enough', 'offer', 'illusion', 'development', 'are', 'meant', 'rely', 'entirely', 'DiCaprio', 'make', 'care', 'story', 'case', 'DiCaprio', 'unable', 'garner', 'interest', 'sympathy', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'DiCaprio', 'overrated', 'actor', 'film', 'did', 'nothing', 'change', 'opinion', 'skills', 'honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'care', 'not', 'Cobb', 'made', 'home', 'Also', 'source', 'personal', 'trauma', 'was', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'early', 'stage', 'movie', 'Which', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'big', 'deal', 'necessarily', 'unveiling', 'dragged', 'out', 'unbearably', 'din', 'heavy', 'handed', 'manner', 'time', 'was', 'fully', ""'revealed"", 'what', 'little', 'interest', 'had', 'was', 'gone.Ellen', 'Page', 'character', 'served', 'catalyst', 'Cobb', 'personal', 'expositions', 'little', 'else', 'not', 'connected', 'Cobb', 'emotional', 'level', 'had', 'more', 'depth', 'other', 'characters', 'simply', 'outsider', 'simplest', 'method', 'exposition', 'concern', 'safety', 'everyone', 'mission', 'going', 'along', 'case', 'Cobb', 'subconscious', 'control', 'However', 'indication', 'whatsoever', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'anything', 'anyone', 'happened', 'fact', 'never', 'anything', 'more', 'stand', 'whisper', 'earnestly', 'Cobb-', 'effect', 'whatsoever', 'had', 'truly', 'been', 'concerned', 'everyone', 'safety', 'should', ""'ve"", 'told', 'upfront', 'Cobb', 'was', 'basketcase', 'unfit', 'share', 'dreams', 'anyone', 'suppose', ""'re"", 'meant', 'assume', 'come', 'care', 'Cobb', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Page', 'performance', 'feel', 'connection', 'two', 'characters', 'Page', 'delivery', 'consistently', 'flat', 'whole', 'film', 'solid', 'character', 'traits', 'motivations', 'own', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'character', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'help', 'Cobb-', 'having', 'known', 'longer', 'already', 'being', 'aware', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'motivations', 'acting', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", ""'waste"", 'time', 'developing', 'character', 'what', 'last', 'thing', 'Page', 'character', 'name', 'Ariadne', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'Bella', 'Swann', 'guess', 'thought', 'were', 'being', 'clever', 'came', 'off', 'ridiculous', 'heavy', 'handed', 'especially', 'comparison', 'everyone', 'else', 'mundane', 'names', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'called', 'Maze', 'Guide', 'Girl.In', 'conclusion', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'character', 'carry', 'especially', 'considering', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Obviously', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'able', 'glean', 'more', 'DiCaprio', 'Page', 'was', 'imagine', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'simply', 'waited', 'be']",N/A

The candy, the people in costumes and of course the rides. But we learned quickly that the best rides required an ""E"" ticket and of course, there were never enough ""E"" tickets for the day.As adults we look to more intellectual pursuits. We read books, travel to distant lands, and on occasion we endeavor to find something new and exciting at the movies. But more often than not, we find that films from Hollywood utterly disappoint us with plots that have been rehashed from hundreds of other films or insult us with vulgar comedies that are churned out on a regular basis.""Inception,"" a new film from Christopher Nolan, the director of ""The Dark Knight,"" is one rare instance when Hollywood has gotten it right. The film has a tightly woven script (also penned by Nolan) that allows the viewer to enter a world of espionage with a clever twist. ""Inception,"" has been advertised as a film similar to ""The Matrix,"" and here to set the record straight: it is not. It is a much better movie than any of the Matrix films, which tend to be too convoluted for any true enjoyment. ""Inception,"" remains unique without reaching too far beyond the boundary of imagination.Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and ""Juno's"" Ellen Page, the film depicts a world in which even your deepest secrets are not save. The new criminal of this world enters into your mind during dream-state in order to steal from you or even implant an idea that could change the world. But how safe is this new form of theft? DiCaprio's character finds that his new world of dreams and reality often are difficult to tell apart. And that like all new technology, a simpler way of life must be abandoned to fully embrace the new one.Christopher Nolan's job as director and writer are spot on. His world of reality intermixed with dreams have stunning visual effects that even out weigh those in ""The Dark Knight."" Out of the supporting cast, most impressive are Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ken Watanabe. The only disappointing part of the film is the bad casting of Marion Cotillard and the annoying insertion of the song ""La vie en rose.""Overall, ""Inception,"" is the best film of the year so far. Being released among the summer it would be shameful if it is not remember for award season. So at last film lovers, it's time to rejoice!

This is how the story goes: Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible -- inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.The cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio (in an impressive performance as Cobb), Ken Watanabe (as Saito), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as Arthur), Marion Cotillard (as Mal), Ellen Page (as Ariadne), Tom Hardy (as Eames), Cillian Murphy (as Robert Fischer, Jr.), Tom Berenger (as Browning) & Michael Caine (as Miles) is brilliant!

Once all the time slips etc are clear, there are plenty of other ideas that become lucid and I realize how much serious thought Nolan put into this concept, and how well executed it is. Like Fight Club, only with multiple viewings does the whole story emerge. And for Nolan to have written and directed this, well, massive respect for that level of vision.]I love the ideas here but Nolan could have tightened it all up a bit more. There are all sorts of conceptual loose ends that a little bit more exposition would have dealt with. The way the love interest is integral yet somehow forced grated now and then, and sometimes it all felt like Nolan was so caught up in his own dream world of this movie that he could have used a ""kick"" or two himself to realize that shorter is sweeter.Buuuut, once I gave up expecting more cohesion and just flowed with it, warts and all, there were plenty of good concepts and CGI eye candy to keep the brain amused, and all in all it was an enjoyable viewing, especially with the fine BD picture quality. The dynamic range is as usual these days a little too much...you can barely hear them talk and then BOOM! Your walls are shaking as a train crashes into the room. But I guess the goal is visceral jolting and that is indeed accomplished.DiCaprio is solid but never stunning, ditto the rest of the cast. I can't remember one moment where I thought, ""That's some fine acting"", nor did I ever think it was bad. It just was, and the focus is so squarely on the dreams-in-dreams that the relationships never really gel. But once again, this is a thrill ride, so asking more might be pointless.I was on occasion reminded of Paprika, and if you like this make sure to see that, clearly an inspiration for Nolan and a truly great movie.[Edit again: One very real highlight here is Zimmer's score, which is haunting and compelling and altogether memorable. I picked up his Inception OST last year and really like it late at night driving on empty roads. The simple two note themes have a lot of power, proving that harmonic context can deeply shape any melody when put in stark relief by the simplicity of that melody. Which fits in perfectly with Nolan's overriding philosophical concept here. Now that's top notch film scoring. The more I watch this the more I love that score and see how tightly integrated it is to Nolan's ideas.

It has a good cast of Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger and cameos by Michael Caine. DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, who is to pull information, through dreams, from the subconscious of their subjects. Cobb is also tortured by personal turmoil in the death of his wife & not being able to see his kids. The premise here is if he pulls off his mission successfully he will be reunited with his two children. The kids make spotty appearances throughout the movie, but Cobb can only see their backs; not their faces.Cobb's mission is to use his ability to alter the subconscious mind of his foe's son, resulting in the collapse an empire controlled by the son & ailing father.The plot is intriguing, but the screenplay kills it. The acting in the movie is good. DiCaprio plays his character well. Levitt has matured very well since his days on TV's 3rd Rock From the Sun. Michael Caine is always a grand addition to a cast. Alas, the actors can't save this movie.It's a cross between action & mind games. The result is a very confusing movie which sinks like a stone. The screenplay is awful.

1305218,A24UW9IC1ROS8Q,B002ZG980U,"K.W. ""voodoo guru""","[10, 31]","The idea for this film is very interesting, and I was quite looking forward to seeing it. Unfortunately it simply did not live up to the hype. If you are the type of person who simply wants to be entertained by pretty pictures, and an outwardly interesting story This may be quite enjoyable. However if you know something about the human psyche and have ever dreamed in detail it will likely be a huge dissapointment. There are so many holes in this film I couldn't even keep track. And the concepts were just goofy as hell. Like the idea that if you ask about a safe, the dreamer will automatically create a safe with all the information you are looking for in it, and all you have to do is break in and you will have his industrial secrets. Ok, I passsed that off as a mildly interesting bit of symbolism, but this movie just keeps going with that kind of rediculous narrow minded, unimaginative approach.A far superior rendition of the dream world was done in What Dreams May Come (whether you like the movie or not). This film (Inception) had a dream wolrd that was very closed off, square and linear. Not open of fluid at all (like actual dreams). If computers could dream, this might be how it would look - no imagination. Armies of trained profesionals coming after anything foreign. I've had a squad tracking me down in my dream. Not a pleasant feeling, but lets be honest, your conscious is a foreign entity while roaming around in your subconscious, so why does the subconscious never go after the host? No nothing ever happens in this film that is consistent with dreaming and the human subconscous. The only thing that comes close is the opening sequence. After that the film just became mired in itself, unneccesarily convaluted, and as a result of all of the plot holes and a lack of character develpment, or even any character depth (except on the part of DiCaprio). But this is appearantly Nolan's style. Creating one dimensional characters in flat lifeless worlds.Even the effects were not that great. The first dream sequence with the girl has Leonardo and Ellen's characters sitting at a cafe and the world around them starts to disintegrate. It looks like a video game. Everything comes apart in blocks, just starts exploding for no appearant reason (who cares anyway), but it just looks kind of auful. Some of the effects were good, but nothing struck me as great. It was all flat and lifeless, just like the rest of the movie.And the characters just plot about doing what they do, appearantly for no other reason than it's in the script. The girl faces the possibilty of eternal damnation in 'limbo' in order to try to protect a bunch of people she has never met, and has not attachment to, and does so with not one imodicum of emotion. They all just plot along like wind up toys. At least if they had all been androids it would have explained why everything is so flat and lifeless, and why the dream world is so increadibly dull, square, and closed off.A couple more holes: The dream within a dream. Ok, I can accept that the subconscious is faster than the consious mind, accounting for the time difference from dreams to reality; a factor of 10. But that a dream within a dream should cause time to fly by at a rate 100 times quicker? What is the reason for this discrepancy? There is none, it is just a rediculous plot device invented to create some sort of drama. And then it just goes on, 1000 times for a dream within a dream etc... And then they feel the physics of a thing happening in the primary dream while they are in the tertiary dream? What absolute nonsense! And it just keeps going like that, building nonsense on nonsense.If you can watch a two hour film without questioning anything, without taking one bit of intellectual interest in the plot, physics, psychology or physiology, then you will probobly enjoy this film. But if you have an intellect, and make the mistake of using it, there is just too much wrong with this piece of tripe. Sorry, but there it is. The only thing that makes this movie interesting is the concept and the ending. The execution is just bad.

Then he breaks it into pieces and makes it again.""- Jean Renoir(SPOILERS)There's a great deal of applicability of this quote when it comes to Christopher Nolan. In Memento a man accidentally kills his wife and can't deal with the guilt so he creates a world of his own to live in in order to come to terms with what happened; in Inception basically the same thing happens but instead of telling the story backwards & from the perspective of someone who no longer has any short term memory this time the gimmick is dreams.Being the spontaneous internet forum wanderer that I am I'd heard here & there comparisons to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of just how intensely visceral of an impact the film has on one's psyche. Now, I didn't go into my viewing with this in mind, but it lingered there back in my subconscious where the guy from Third Rock from the Sun & Bronson were trying to steal whatever secrets I have.The difference between a film like Kubrick's awe inspiring masterpiece and Nolan's film which only makes it to the level of 'just good' is that there's this sense in Nolan's film of being scared of alienating too many people from enjoying his film. ""Well, I'll make it sort of complex, but only include the most base ideas and the most placid dreams imaginable. Oh, and the end will be kind of ambiguous but not too much, don't want to make anyone angry or instigate any kind of lengthy discussions.""As seems to be the deal with Nolan his main actor is really cringe worthy or laugh inducing (""OH JESUS CHRIST!!!!"") DiCaprio doesn't go through the film growling at people but he is still pretty bad. To be honest the only one who doesn't seem to be phoning in a performance is Tom Hardy, and that's only barely the case.The folding of Paris was pretty nice, but everything else just seemed flat and Nolan never, in 150 minutes, gets the feel of a dream quite down; not when DiCaprio is Mr. Charles in the bar, not when Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Jamiroquai-ing it up with some guys in a hall or hauling a floating bundle of his buddies into an elevator.

1305229,A3I7B5OA1TYCCB,B002ZG980U,Lesley Z,"[1, 4]","Take a thought, any thought. Now, there are many ways to take that conception and implant in other minds...speech, writing, music, movies, mimes etc. There is subliminal insertion, hypnotic insertion, even insertion on levels we never think about like smell. Pheromones can create a connection or replusion that undercuts our thinking mind. Have you ever met someone and felt that major attraction, or almost physical revulsion and could not quite understand why? Our brains and senses take in information on immeasurable levels and process that data millions of times a day. So it is with the thoughts we process.We always assume that our thoughts are our own. It is only because we are so aware of advertising, mind manipulation etc. that in this day and age the magician must go to great lengths to impress us. Even our subconscious will eventually root out any foreign mental construct that does not fit into the ""one of us"" concept, like antibodies seeking out an infection. How to get around our built-in swat squad? How to plant an idea at so deep a level even the subconscious is unaware of the invasion? Once acheived the possibilites are limitless!Inception, the instant an idea comes into being...the Big Bang of conscious, or subconscious creation. Think of jacking-in to someone's mind like in the Matrix. Now, conceive of going into the lower levels of subconsciousness...the dream within the dream, the other realms of lucid dreaming. Take a team of mind hi-jackers and go in to someone's super consciousness and plant the seed of an idea. That seed must be left to germinate unfettered in the subjec'ts mind, so that to all intents and purposes, the thought is their own. That person will never question their own inner reality, because no one else can penetrate the cerebral barrier, or so they believe.INCEPTION takes this concept of mind invasion and runs with it to the pit of the super consciousness. Leonardo Dicaprio plays the mind hijacker and with his team of psuedo-psychic freelancers, his character drops in on the inner world of the son of a very rich and extremely important man. The assignment...get in there...set up the scenario like controlling a lucid dream...set the pieces ever so gently in place and activate the ""go"" button metaphorically speaking. Easier said than done. Once inside the clutter of someone else's mind, it can be hard to hang on to our own reality. Where does the boundry go when we start to merge into cross-realities? Demons, we all have them. If those demons, those constructs of our own minds start to take form and identity of their own, how will we deal with the consequences of that?The special effects in this movie are superb, the script insightful, acting...for this type of action movie...great by all members of the cast. The concept is delicious revelry. Who does not wish they could bend reality, be full force in inside a frenetic action/adventure game with the clock ticking and terrorists and inner demons nipping at your heels? SUCH FUN!! Watching the team dive deeper and deeper into the super conscious realm is amazing.For those of us who are lucid dreamers and used to delta and theta wave interaction, this movie is an affirmation of the worlds we inhabit each night. For those who hardly remember their dreams, or swear they never dream, watch this movie carefully. When you go to sleep the next time tell yourself what you want to dream about and go for it. It takes a little practice, but you too can go any place/time you want and consciously drive the action. It's all there in the super conscious mind.

1305233,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B002ZG980U,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[2, 3]","Before I saw this movie this afternoon, I didn't pretend to have an interest in it.  I'm not sure why, its just no one could be very specific about what it was about, so it all sounded dull to me, the most I heard was ""Its about a guy going in to people's dreams.""  Other than that I didn't hear much else.  I have watched films by Christopher Nolan before, such as ""Momento"", and the new Batman films, but not because he did them, just because they sounded intriguing.  I learned a while ago not to pin expectations on any director, just to watch a movie and hopefully it'll be semi-enjoyable.With my mindset as it was, having never seen a preview or anything, I actually feel VERY blessed.  The truth is is that you are better off not knowing anything about it as this movie is so complex and has many mysteries in it that it is just worth experiencing it and having someone try to describe it to you is kind of a waste of time, just go see it.  I will just say that it is hands down the best action film of the year, though its much more than an action film.The thing that you should know about this movie is that it seems, from the reviews I have read and the people I have talked to whom have seen it, what will determine how much you enjoy this is a. Your expectations of the movie. b.  If you want something that makes you think as opposed to only a thrill ride.  or c.  You have an interest in dreams.  As many have said the film is slow and boring, but for me it was a very intriguing analysis of the sleeping state of the mind, but it definitely would have fared better with everyone if it had a more concise script.  The acting was pretty good, I am not particularly a fan of Dicaprio, but he did a pretty decent job as did all of the cast with what they were given, and other than Dicaprio's character and one other character, there was not a lot of character development, but there was definitely enough in his character alone to keep it interesting.  It is nice to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a higher profile movie, and its also nice to see Ken Watanabe and Ellen Page again as well.  The script had some glaring problems such as, at times, a lack of momentum and a lack of character development outside of the main character... but those are pretty minor since the movie quite effective and enjoyable for the most part and delved deep in to human emotions such as guilt and the long-term effects they can have on us.I want to do an analysis of the film's ideas, but I will not do that here as that's about as much as I can say without ruining anything about the film.  Although this movie is not flawless and borrows from many movies from the late 90's, it does it, for the most part, fairly successfully. Overall, I would say, in a summer (as all summers are) full of midless action films and tired comedies, this is a much welcome reprieve for many movie fans.God Bless ~Amy",4,The LESS you know the better.,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,2892,"['saw', 'movie', 'afternoon', 'did', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'have', 'interest', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'just', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'specific', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'sounded', 'dull', 'most', 'heard', 'was', 'guy', 'going', 'people', 'dreams', 'Other', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'much', 'else', 'have', 'watched', 'films', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'such', 'Momento', 'new', 'Batman', 'films', 'not', 'did', 'just', 'sounded', 'intriguing', 'learned', 'while', 'ago', 'not', 'pin', 'expectations', 'director', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'semi-enjoyable.With', 'mindset', 'was', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'preview', 'anything', 'actually', 'feel', 'VERY', 'blessed', 'truth', 'are', 'better', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'about', 'movie', 'so', 'complex', 'many', 'mysteries', 'just', 'worth', 'experiencing', 'having', 'someone', 'try', 'describe', 'kind', 'waste', 'time', 'just', 'go', 'see', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'action', 'film', 'year', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'film.The', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'movie', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'people', 'have', 'talked', 'whom', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'will', 'determine', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'expectations', 'movie', 'b', 'want', 'something', 'think', 'opposed', 'only', 'thrill', 'ride', 'c.', 'have', 'interest', 'dreams', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'slow', 'boring', 'was', 'very', 'intriguing', 'analysis', 'sleeping', 'state', 'mind', 'definitely', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'better', 'everyone', 'had', 'more', 'concise', 'script', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'am', 'not', 'particularly', 'fan', 'Dicaprio', 'did', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'did', 'cast', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'other', 'Dicaprio', 'character', 'one', 'other', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'there', 'was', 'definitely', 'enough', 'character', 'alone', 'keep', 'interesting', 'nice', 'see', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'higher', 'profile', 'movie', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'again', 'as', 'well', 'script', 'had', 'glaring', 'problems', 'such', 'times', 'lack', 'momentum', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'main', 'character', 'are', 'pretty', 'minor', 'movie', 'quite', 'effective', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'part', 'delved', 'deep', 'human', 'emotions', 'such', 'guilt', 'long-term', 'effects', 'can', 'have', 'us.I', 'want', 'do', 'analysis', 'film', 'ideas', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'that', 'here', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'say', 'ruining', 'anything', 'film', 'movie', 'not', 'flawless', 'borrows', 'many', 'movies', 'late', '90', 'most', 'part', 'fairly', 'successfully', 'Overall', 'would', 'say', 'summer', 'summers', 'are', 'full', 'midless', 'action', 'films', 'tired', 'comedies', 'much', 'welcome', 'reprieve', 'many', 'movie', 'fans.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

The film is polished and the script must have taken a genius locked in a room for at least a decade to write.  Top notch special effects and cinematography give the viewer the feel of disorientation and being in the characters' dreamworld, fighting to climb between layers of consciousness.  The movie needs the viewer to  take great leaps of faith on what dreams and the power of suggestion can do.The hero, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) feels lost in time and space, what is real.  Like the children's song ending - is life ""But a dream""?  The movie hops between dreams and reality.  You begin to wonder what is reality, where am I in this story?Cobb had a wife that could not understand if she was in a dream or in reality.  This is the problem in his most important dream.  How can Cobb keep her from ruining his most important plan  - a plan that will return him home to his two children?Cobb says we often do not remember the beginning of a dream, do we need to?  -  and what is dream time?  Is it possible to share others' consciousness in a group dream and can time be synchronized with everyone else you are interacting with?  How do you know where you are and how long you have to finish a project?  ""Inception"" is adrift in time and levels of dream experience. We are never sure where Cobb or his crew is in reality.Cobb's job is to enter the minds of other men to steal ideas.  Cobb is hired by a high-level energy executive (and billionaire)  to insert an idea into a rival's mind so the rival believes completely that it is his own idea.  The rival then embraces the spirit and feeling of something that he may have fought in real life.  The energy executive is Saito (Ken Watanabe) and this ""dream job"" would end Cobb's forced exile from his children and father-in-law, Miles (Michael Caine).So Cobb has the money to put together a cutting-edge team of dream specialists.  He works with long-time partner, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a new dream architect Ariadne, (Ellen Page). a couple of other helpers, as well as a chemist that puts together potions for deep, shared dreams.  They hop on a trans-Pacific jet with targeted Billionaire, Robert Fischer, Jr.(Cillian Murphy) that Saito wants him to change his mind and initiate the thought he can be his own man, he can break up his corporation and move on to make his own life.  A positive thought, instead of surrendering his corporation - just framing the idea in a good way to eliminate opposition.Adriadne, the architect, creates the labyrinths and mazes that the participants must maneuver throughout the three levels of the dream, and must be there for the ""idea changers"" as time, space and reality change.  She learns the art of controlling and navigating through dreams.  The films fantastic special effects are exquisitely effective with the unique and well-thought out script.  There are gunfights and car crashes as Fischer evidently has had some dream training and carries along his bodyguards to protect his subconscious. Even though there are many chase and gunfights it does not get old as you feel otherworldly along with the cast.  A different feeling overwhelms as gravity and perception change along with the characters moving from dream level to dream level still tethered in each dream's ""now.""Everyone is taking risks to go to such deep levels of dreaming, but Cobb is taking danger to the hilt by not moving on from his grief and deep guilt complex involving his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard).  She interferes in his dream world and sometimes overlaps in the main mission.  How this is resolved is important and white knuckled excitement.The movie grabs your gut as well as your imagination.  Well written, creative and mind-bending to the nth degree, it is an exquisite trip to subconscious worlds.",4,Definitely Different -,1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,3902,"['Inception', 'multi-layered', 'plot', 'based', 'dreams', 'navigating', 'subconscious', 'plant', 'information', 'ideas', 'film', 'polished', 'script', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'genius', 'locked', 'room', 'least', 'decade', 'write', 'Top', 'notch', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'give', 'viewer', 'feel', 'disorientation', 'being', 'characters', 'dreamworld', 'fighting', 'climb', 'layers', 'consciousness', 'movie', 'viewer', 'take', 'great', 'leaps', 'faith', 'what', 'dreams', 'power', 'suggestion', 'can', 'do.The', 'hero', 'Cobb', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'lost', 'time', 'space', 'what', 'real', 'children', 'song', 'ending', 'life', 'dream', 'movie', 'dreams', 'reality', 'begin', 'wonder', 'what', 'reality', 'where', 'am', 'story', 'Cobb', 'had', 'wife', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'was', 'dream', 'reality', 'problem', 'most', 'important', 'dream', 'How', 'can', 'Cobb', 'keep', 'ruining', 'most', 'important', 'plan', 'plan', 'will', 'return', 'home', 'two', 'children', 'Cobb', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'beginning', 'dream', 'do', 'need', 'what', 'dream', 'time', 'possible', 'share', 'others', 'consciousness', 'group', 'dream', 'can', 'time', 'be', 'synchronized', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'interacting', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'how', 'long', 'have', 'finish', 'project', 'Inception', 'adrift', 'time', 'levels', 'dream', 'experience', 'are', 'never', 'sure', 'where', 'Cobb', 'crew', 'reality.Cobb', 'job', 'enter', 'minds', 'other', 'men', 'steal', 'ideas', 'Cobb', 'hired', 'high-level', 'energy', 'executive', 'billionaire', 'insert', 'idea', 'rival', 'mind', 'rival', 'completely', 'own', 'idea', 'rival', 'then', 'spirit', 'feeling', 'something', 'may', 'have', 'fought', 'real', 'life', 'energy', 'executive', 'Saito', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'dream', 'job', 'would', 'end', 'Cobb', 'forced', 'exile', 'children', 'father-in-law', 'Miles', 'Michael', 'Caine', '.So', 'Cobb', 'money', 'put', 'together', 'cutting-edge', 'team', 'dream', 'specialists', 'long-time', 'partner', 'Arthur', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'new', 'dream', 'architect', 'Ariadne', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'couple', 'other', 'helpers', 'as', 'well', 'chemist', 'together', 'potions', 'deep', 'shared', 'dreams', 'hop', 'trans-Pacific', 'jet', 'targeted', 'Billionaire', 'Robert', 'Fischer', 'Jr.', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Saito', 'change', 'mind', 'initiate', 'thought', 'can', 'be', 'own', 'man', 'can', 'break', 'up', 'corporation', 'move', 'make', 'own', 'life', 'positive', 'thought', 'instead', 'surrendering', 'corporation', 'just', 'framing', 'idea', 'good', 'way', 'eliminate', 'opposition.Adriadne', 'architect', 'labyrinths', 'participants', 'must', 'maneuver', 'three', 'levels', 'dream', 'must', 'be', 'there', 'idea', 'changers', 'time', 'space', 'reality', 'change', 'art', 'controlling', 'navigating', 'dreams', 'films', 'fantastic', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'exquisitely', 'effective', 'unique', 'well-thought', 'out', 'script', 'are', 'gunfights', 'car', 'crashes', 'Fischer', 'evidently', 'had', 'dream', 'training', 'bodyguards', 'protect', 'subconscious', 'Even', 'are', 'many', 'chase', 'gunfights', 'not', 'get', 'old', 'feel', 'otherworldly', 'cast', 'different', 'feeling', 'overwhelms', 'gravity', 'perception', 'change', 'characters', 'moving', 'dream', 'level', 'dream', 'level', 'still', 'tethered', 'dream', 'now', 'Everyone', 'taking', 'risks', 'go', 'such', 'deep', 'levels', 'dreaming', 'Cobb', 'taking', 'danger', 'hilt', 'not', 'moving', 'grief', 'deep', 'guilt', 'complex', 'involving', 'wife', 'Mal', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'dream', 'world', 'sometimes', 'overlaps', 'main', 'mission', 'How', 'resolved', 'important', 'white', 'knuckled', 'excitement.The', 'movie', 'grabs', 'gut', 'as', 'well', 'imagination', 'Well', 'written', 'creative', 'mind-bending', 'nth', 'degree', 'exquisite', 'trip', 'subconscious', 'worlds']",N/A
1305243,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B002ZG980U,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[2, 3]","'Reality is that which when you stop believing in it does not go away.'  Philip K Dick.Christopher Nolan's movies are among my favorite movies of the last ten years.  I remember being incredibly impressed withMemento, and own it.Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition), ($373m ww) also starring Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine and Ken Watanabe), inspired me to explore and understand the idea of archetypes and mythology in movies, and presenting characters first as something else. He saved the Batman franchise and took it to a new level with Dark Knight grossing over $1 billion worldwide, and he also made The Prestige, (again with Michael Caine).  I think that after seeing Inception everyone who knows movies will appreciate who Christopher Nolan is, and his brilliance not only as a director, but also as the writer of Inception.Leonardo di Caprio, not just a talented actor, has undoubtedly become one of the most reliable barometers of movie quality with a string of outstanding movies such as The Aviator The Departed, and Shutter Island, the thrillerBody of Lies, and Blood Diamond, delivers another outstanding performance. It's also refreshing to see Marion Cotillard who won the Oscar forLa Vie en Rose (Extended Version)once again in a movie worthy of her talent.  She brings a certain richness and emotionality to what is mostly a visual spectacle.As you begin to watch, you may notice parallels between Inception and James Bond and The Matrix, although the stacking of realities seems more reminsicent mostly ofThe Jacketor Total Recall, both based on Philip K Dick stories.As the movie opens Cobb washes up on a beach.  The armed rescuers notice a a gun in his belt.  He is taken to the Overlord, an old man. He also has a spinning top.In the Matrix, Neo was a computer hacker. In Inception, Cobb, Leo DiCaprio's character is a mind hacker.In the world of Inception, some people have the technology to invade the unconscious mind of others, and take their ideas.  It is also possible to implant ideas, without people being aware. This is called Inception. You may wonder what being a spy and being a dream hacker have in common.As a hypnotist I can say Inception is a fascinating trance experience, and takes you deeper, and continually shifts scenes. Because of this, you may miss out on some details, and you may in fact, as I did, have to go see the movie again to fill in the blanks.  I understood the levels a lot better the second time.Something to watch out for is trains and Mal's talk of trains, breaking glass repeated, a ring on Cobb's finger that appears and disappears in the second scene, and seems to shift to the overlord, and later Saito's finger.  Not sure what it means.If you have not already seen it, the following may be helpful. The unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and imaginary. That is a conscious distinction. The unconscious mind is the domain of memory, emotion, and imagination. Your unconscious mind repeatedly presents unresolved issues to be resolved, which is one of the main functions of dreaming. You don't always remember a dream after you have had it.There are some allusions to mythology. In Greek mythology, Ariadne constructed a maze. There is a character called Fischer, the son of Fischer, ailing ruler of an empire.  In mythology, we have the story of the Fisher King.I particularly loved the last moments in the movie, and I think you will too.'All reality is an illusion, albeit a persistent one.'  Albert Einstein.If you're like me, I think you will remember Inception long after the final credits roll.  I think a lot of people will have to see it more than once to get it. The best way to describe it I think is that it is a 'tour de force' of the imagination,and raises the bar on creativity.  Aspiring directors will look to this movie, and raise their own standards.  Well, I can dream, can't I?Having said all this,  I know this movie will not appeal to everyone. Some people may be overwhelmed by it, and others just won't get it. I think most people will love it, and it will do very well based on word of mouth.I hope this review was helpful to you.",4,Going deeper than you can imagine,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,4146,"[""'Reality"", 'when', 'stop', 'believing', 'not', 'go', 'away', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick.Christopher', 'Nolan', 'movies', 'are', 'favorite', 'movies', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'remember', 'being', 'incredibly', 'impressed', 'withMemento', 'own', 'it.Batman', 'Begins', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', '373m', 'ww', 'also', 'starring', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'inspired', 'explore', 'understand', 'idea', 'archetypes', 'mythology', 'movies', 'presenting', 'characters', 'first', 'something', 'else', 'saved', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'took', 'new', 'level', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'grossing', '1', 'billion', 'worldwide', 'also', 'made', 'Prestige', 'again', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'think', 'seeing', 'Inception', 'everyone', 'who', 'movies', 'will', 'appreciate', 'who', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'brilliance', 'not', 'only', 'director', 'also', 'writer', 'Inception.Leonardo', 'di', 'Caprio', 'not', 'just', 'talented', 'actor', 'undoubtedly', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'reliable', 'barometers', 'movie', 'quality', 'string', 'outstanding', 'movies', 'such', 'Aviator', 'Departed', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'thrillerBody', 'Lies', 'Blood', 'Diamond', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'also', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'forLa', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'Extended', 'Version', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'worthy', 'talent', 'certain', 'richness', 'emotionality', 'what', 'mostly', 'visual', 'spectacle.As', 'begin', 'watch', 'may', 'notice', 'parallels', 'Inception', 'James', 'Bond', 'Matrix', 'stacking', 'realities', 'more', 'reminsicent', 'mostly', 'ofThe', 'Jacketor', 'Total', 'Recall', 'based', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'stories.As', 'movie', 'Cobb', 'up', 'beach', 'armed', 'rescuers', 'notice', 'gun', 'belt', 'taken', 'Overlord', 'old', 'man', 'also', 'spinning', 'top.In', 'Matrix', 'Neo', 'was', 'computer', 'hacker', 'Inception', 'Cobb', 'Leo', 'DiCaprio', 'character', 'mind', 'hacker.In', 'world', 'Inception', 'people', 'have', 'technology', 'invade', 'unconscious', 'mind', 'others', 'take', 'ideas', 'also', 'possible', 'implant', 'ideas', 'people', 'being', 'aware', 'called', 'Inception', 'may', 'wonder', 'what', 'being', 'spy', 'being', 'dream', 'hacker', 'have', 'common.As', 'hypnotist', 'can', 'say', 'Inception', 'fascinating', 'trance', 'experience', 'deeper', 'continually', 'shifts', 'scenes', 'may', 'miss', 'out', 'details', 'may', 'fact', 'did', 'have', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'fill', 'blanks', 'understood', 'levels', 'lot', 'better', 'second', 'time.Something', 'watch', 'out', 'trains', 'Mal', 'talk', 'trains', 'breaking', 'glass', 'repeated', 'ring', 'Cobb', 'finger', 'second', 'scene', 'shift', 'overlord', 'later', 'Saito', 'finger', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'means.If', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'seen', 'following', 'may', 'be', 'helpful', 'unconscious', 'mind', 'can', 'not', 'distinguish', 'what', 'real', 'imaginary', 'conscious', 'distinction', 'unconscious', 'mind', 'domain', 'memory', 'emotion', 'imagination', 'unconscious', 'mind', 'repeatedly', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'be', 'resolved', 'one', 'main', 'functions', 'dreaming', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'remember', 'dream', 'have', 'had', 'it.There', 'are', 'allusions', 'mythology', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'Ariadne', 'constructed', 'maze', 'character', 'called', 'Fischer', 'son', 'Fischer', 'ailing', 'ruler', 'empire', 'mythology', 'have', 'story', 'Fisher', 'King.I', 'particularly', 'loved', 'last', 'moments', 'movie', 'think', 'will', 'too', ""'All"", 'reality', 'illusion', 'persistent', 'one', 'Albert', 'Einstein.If', ""'re"", 'think', 'will', 'remember', 'Inception', 'long', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'see', 'more', 'once', 'get', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'think', ""'tour"", 'de', 'force', 'imagination', 'bar', 'creativity', 'Aspiring', 'directors', 'will', 'look', 'movie', 'raise', 'own', 'standards', 'Well', 'can', 'dream', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Having', 'said', 'know', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'overwhelmed', 'others', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'will', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'based', 'word', 'mouth.I', 'hope', 'review', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

1305264,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B002ZG980U,maskedgamer,"[6, 15]","It took me a while to digest inception. Not because the movie plays tricks on the mind but because I wanted to really think about it.There are some great things about the movie which are mostly the action and the special effects, and then there are some not so great things about the movie and that's what lost it points with me.Inception was an interesting idea but it's poorly executed. The movie feels like a lot of what might make it truly interesting is just missing and filled in with bland subject matter. For instance the movie is about persons who are go into peoples minds through the act of dreaming to steal their ideas and information.Just thinking about the plot reminds me just how little sense the movie makes. Isn't there a better way to get information out of people than this super hypnosis? What makes the movie interesting though is that it all takes place in a dream world where somehow people can connect to one anothers dreams somehow.The weird part is that this high technology just seems like a normal occurrence in their lowtech world. So much so that some persons have trained themselves to fight against such mental attacks by equipping armed personnel in their minds.What this really is.... is the MATRIX recycled. Only this time it's not in a distant future. Just like the matrix this movie is full and I mean full of those ""what the hell is going on here?"" moments mixed in with ""gee this boring""... and lastly ""oh wow! look at that!""instead of a World where people are actually sleeping but think everything is real, this is a world where people are awake but we they are pushed into a dream world where they supposed to think everything is real. Replace the Matrix guys in shades with ""projections"" and there you have it. Complete with special effects and all.Regardless of what anyone says this is pretty much the same movie recycled.There are too many inconsistencies with this movie to say its 4 or 5 stars just because it looks good. The story is just plain... well... not interesting. I was more interested in knowing how ""jumping into peoples dreams"" became a prime too for corporate espionage or just who was the Asian guy? What was his role in the company? How did the others get started into dream diving? (light spoiler)Why can't Leonardo DiCaprio(yes, the actual character names are HORRIBLE!) return home? No one saw him? There were no witnesses and his wife was in a completely different building or other side of the building when it occurred(end). So how did that come in to play as ruining his life? because his wife wrote letters? who cares take it to court and prove it! Just simple things like that seemed to just skip around all the plot holes and no one ever asked questions. Always some simple excuse was given and that was it. That's what the audience is supposed to swallow down.So much of the dreamworld doesn't make sense. If they are jumping into someone else's mind shouldn't they have 100% control. Regardless if they have an architect creating a false world shouldn't it be up to the dreamer to create or destroy what they want? It just doesn't make any sense. They need to go into Fischer's dreams which is a world that he creates to steal secrets and implant idea's? Are they confusing ""dreaming"" with ""hypnosis?"" Honestly the logic behind the movie barely works and doesn't make the least bit of sense.How about the part of feeling pain in your dream. Isn't that the point of putting people to sleep during operations so they don't feel pain. ""Pain is in the mind"" so that overrides physical pain now? your telling me I could poke you with a needle in your sleep but you won't feel it unless your dreaming about it? It's a bunch of bull.I can tell you first hand. When I feel pain in a dream it's because I'm experiencing it in real life. But enough about that plot hole I could go on for days. Lets get to another plot hole. How about ""the kick"" and the levels of dreaming which I assume are levels of sleep. First off there's only one level of sleep. If your asleep YOUR ASLEEP!. The rest are stages you experience before your actually asleep. So what's with all the kicks. If you dream your falling off a cliff don't you just wake up? and why would someone elses kick while they are in ""your"" dream effect them solely but not you? Your the dreamer shouldn't your world be in 1st person? If your mind isn't there present to experience your dream than why do those ""projected dreams"" still exists?If Fischer is unconscious in his dream or he dies why doesn't the dream just fade and send everyone into limbo like it should!  Why is limbo in this dream Cobbs limbo and not Fischer's? And I don't want to hear anyone say ""oh they were in Cobbs mind"" I say bull turds! to that! The movie contradicted itself when Cobb or whomever stated ""they were going to have Fischer tap into his own mind or dream or whatever"". Then that doesn't make sense when Fishers projections are attacking everyone but for some reason they are in Cobbs world now that I think about it minus another star this movie didn't make any sense at all!Screw this movie. It's an action flick with a poorly written script, a mediocre story (I could care less about Cobbs marital problems), that tries to trip the audience out by confusing them with the dream nonsense. The only thing that's confusing here was the screenplay the directors wrote. This movie was a ""matrix"" cash in that came in years later after the matrix series ended. The only thing is as Trippy as the matrix was it actually held my interest because of it's off the wall story that made you think ""what if this really all was a dream""...and there we go again with the reality complex!where inception tries to do the same with its trash ending to confuse you as to what reality is.Here's the bottom line. The Matrix did the dream world better go rent and watch that instead. Pick this movie up if you just want to see the special effects because that's all this movie offers. There certainly isn't a story worth remembering here. The only thing people talk about with this movie is ""Wow, it looked great!"" and ""what the hell happened in this movie?",2,What this really is...is the MATRIX + Ocean's 11!,1293667200,"12 30,

""This film is revolutionary!"" ""It sucks!"" ""It's dumb and pointless!"" ""It's amazing!""  And having finally seen Inception, without many expectations, I can tell you that if you were to see one film, for the remainder of the summer, you should make it Inception.Inception has alot going for it. Its cast works wonders, because every actor brings something fresh and new to the table. It never feels outdated, or irrelevant. It's original without being idiotic. It's intelligent without being implausible. It doesn't take its extremely layered plot too seriously, and there's one thing that really separates it from any other summer action flick: It requires a great deal of thought. You don't know where it's going next. Once it pulls you into its clutches, it takes you on a ride that is unlike anything you've seen onscreen in years. Its ending will be debated, analyzed and picked apart by many film snobs across the world, and it's a film that doesn't just deserve, but requires multiple viewings. It's a hell of alot to take in at once.Now, in any film review, a reader would like to know what the piece is about. This one's plot is better left unsaid, because the first viewing is enough to leave the audience in utter awe. However, I'll do my best to at least give you an idea.Leonardo DiCaprio outshines any of his previous works, playing Dom Cobb, a thief who is proficient in extraction (going into a subject's mind, during dreams, and stealing their ideas, and using them against them), who is embarking on one final job before he can retire, and go home for good. Instead of stealing a subjects dream, he and his team decide to do the opposite. Not to steal a dream, but to go into a person's subconscious and plant an idea.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, of (500) Days Of Summer fame, and Ellen Page, of Juno fame, Marion Cotillard, of Nine and La Vie En Rose greatness, Ken Watanabe, of The Last Samurai, Cillian Murphy, of indie film fame, and a few legends (Michael Caine and Tom Berenger) are the heart of this film. There is truly great acting all around. Everybody brings something new to the table. Each character is richly detailed, and multi-layered. Nobody is really who they say they are. Gordon-Levitt, Page and Cotillard are a few of my favorite actors of the current generation, who haven't had their ""big breaks"" quite yet. They've had a few parts that they're semi-well known for, and this film is a fabulous transition into mainstream cinema. That's because this is an art-house film that is financed by a major studio. That's the beauty of it. Insight, intelligence and uncanny originality are things you don't see in movies anymore. It's a breath of fresh air to see something as unique and interesting as this.But, at the end of the day, it's Christopher Nolan's genius ideas, smart script, elegant direction, and masterful artistry that make this picture what it is. This is a film that I could picture the writer-director losing his mind over. It's his story, it's his game. He invents a world that you've never seen in any type of film before. It's reminiscent of The Matrix, and the early James Bond pictures. It creates its own metropolis, and its own rules. It breaks the rules of conventional American cinema. And thank god for that.

Global praise has been peppered upon all involved with this sci-fi headache, some calling it the Citizen Kane of the dream-within-a-dream genre. (albeit a market that is wide open ATM).But I, for one, am not with the majority of the planet on this one. When I first heard on Radio1 of the Conception of Inception and that it was close to Completion, I was hella excited. I've always been a fan of dreams, or 'Cranial Intertainments' as I fondly call them. They're funny, scary and unpredictable, whats not to love? Go dreams. So this film sounded very intriguing to me.But unfortunately the magic and surreality, beauty, horror and broken reality and ugliness of dreams was in no way portrayed accurately in this film, Inception.Do me one little favour. When you go to bed tonight, close your eyes. Fall asleep. Then wake up in the AM and tell me what you witnessed during your unconcious hours. Anything like the 'dreams' that occur in the movie Inception? No, obv!I'm presuming people will think I'm focusing on the wrong aspects of this film,but I just think this is way too Hollywoody an approach for such a crimson idea. They should've given it to Polanski. At least then we could have had pretty, French-looking women to enjoy looking at.Also, I found the part where they're falling off a bridge in a van into a river and the one guy ties them all up and floats about a hotel achingly dull and needlessly prolonged. Even the special effects of the buildings when they go all weird and stuff...it just failed to arouse me in any way at all!Basically, love the onion-ethic (reality being like layers of an infinite onion, you peel away layer after layer) of this motion picture, and I generally like the ideas a lot, but think this film is a miscarraige of imagination.And if anyone was wondering about the end of this film...the spinning top never stops.",3,A review within a review within a review...,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,2154,"['review', 'review', 'implications', 'put', 'forward', 'yarnsmiths', 'wonderful', 'ly', 'flawed', 'feature-length', 'so', 'so', 'so', 'times', 'forever', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'ad', 'infinitum.There', 'lot', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'indeed', 'lot', 'been', 'said', 'Global', 'praise', 'been', 'peppered', 'involved', 'sci-fi', 'headache', 'calling', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'dream-within-a-dream', 'genre', 'market', 'wide', 'open', 'ATM', '.But', 'one', 'am', 'not', 'majority', 'planet', 'one', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Radio1', 'Conception', 'Inception', 'was', 'close', 'Completion', 'was', 'hella', 'excited', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'dreams', ""'Cranial"", 'Intertainments', 'fondly', 'call', ""'re"", 'funny', 'scary', 'unpredictable', 'not', 'love', 'Go', 'dreams', 'So', 'film', 'sounded', 'very', 'intriguing', 'me.But', 'unfortunately', 'magic', 'surreality', 'beauty', 'horror', 'broken', 'reality', 'ugliness', 'dreams', 'was', 'way', 'portrayed', 'accurately', 'film', 'Inception.Do', 'one', 'little', 'favour', 'When', 'go', 'bed', 'tonight', 'close', 'eyes', 'Fall', 'asleep', 'Then', 'wake', 'up', 'AM', 'tell', 'what', 'witnessed', 'unconcious', 'hours', 'Anything', ""'dreams"", 'occur', 'movie', 'Inception', 'No', 'obv', ""'m"", 'presuming', 'people', 'will', 'think', ""'m"", 'focusing', 'wrong', 'aspects', 'film', 'just', 'think', 'way', 'too', 'Hollywoody', 'approach', 'such', 'crimson', 'idea', 'should', ""'ve"", 'given', 'Polanski', 'least', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'pretty', 'French-looking', 'women', 'enjoy', 'looking', 'found', 'part', 'where', ""'re"", 'falling', 'off', 'bridge', 'van', 'river', 'one', 'guy', 'up', 'floats', 'hotel', 'achingly', 'dull', 'needlessly', 'prolonged', 'Even', 'special', 'effects', 'buildings', 'when', 'go', 'weird', 'stuff', 'just', 'failed', 'arouse', 'way', 'Basically', 'love', 'onion-ethic', 'reality', 'being', 'layers', 'infinite', 'onion', 'peel', 'away', 'layer', 'layer', 'motion', 'picture', 'generally', 'ideas', 'lot', 'think', 'film', 'miscarraige', 'imagination.And', 'anyone', 'was', 'wondering', 'end', 'film', 'spinning', 'top', 'never', 'stops']",N/A

I had high hopes for ""Inception"" because everyone I know who saw it absolutely loved it, but it just didn't do anything for me. It reminded me of a slightly improved ""Matrix"" (which I absolutely hated). ""Inception"" is more thought-out, with good acting, a fantastic score, and impressive visual effects. However, I thought the plot itself was kind of lame, to be quite honest. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that it is WAY too long (almost three hours). I also felt that it was somewhat predictable, because within the first 20 minutes or so, I had an idea of how the film would end, and I was totally right, so there was no big surprise for me when the final scene rolled around. Some of the dream sequences got a little too crazy, and for a while the movie turned into an action flick when everyone started shooting at each other during the snowy mountain sequence. That detracted from the rest of the film. I think I would have enjoyed it more if Marion Cotillard had a bit more screen time, because the scenes she shared with Leonardo DiCaprio were the most interesting and enjoyable for me.

Leonardo DiCaprio (Cobb) has mastered the art of ""architecting"" dreams and pulling others into the dream.  Once in, he is able to gain the other person's secrets, as people are less cautious about guarding information in their dreams.Throughout the film he has a goal of getting back to the United States to see his two children.  This may be impossible because he is somewhat responsible for the death of his wife (Mal).  He makes a deal with a powerful businessman (Saito) that if he can plant an idea for another businessman (Fisher) to break up his company, Saito will ensure that Cobb can pass through customs without a second look.Cobb uses a team to accomplish this mission including Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Arthur) and Ellen Page (Ariadne).  Ariadne has exceptional talent and learns to see and architect dreams rapidly.  The team needs to bring Fisher through three levels of a dream to put the idea in his mind that his company needs to be broken up.The movie goes on to explain that at each deeper level of dreaming time can pass very slowly (as much as decades in the lowest level) because the brain is so powerful, while very little time passes in the real world.  Cobb and his Mal had experienced and entire lifetime within a dream.  Mal seems to constantly be in Cobb's dreams and always wants to destroy the fabric of the dream.  Cobb carries a small top that he uses to let him know whether her is the dreamer or he has been brought into a dream created by Mal.I highly enjoyed this film and found it so thought provoking.  The acting was first-rate and Ellen Page is developing into one of the top actresses around.  The film is very complicated and requires several viewings to really understand everything.

Tresca ""Talien""","[256, 290]","On the surface Inception seems to be a crime caper, complete with master of disguise Eames (Tom Hardy), planner Aridane (Ellen Page), point man Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and master thief Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio). But it's so much more than that, taking place in dreams within dreams within dreams.Inception, like Total Recall and The Matrix, is about perception.  The audience is never sure what reality is because the protagonist isn't sure what's real. There are clues providing evidence for the real/not real theories, but the best movies of this type don't come down on one side or another.  Total Recall ultimately had enough clues indicating the ""right"" way.  The Matrix stumbled after it made it clear that reality was fiction, thereby losing an audience who enjoyed the tantalizing mystery.  Like so many mysteries, once the truth was revealed it wasn't quite as exciting as we all hoped. Inception wisely avoids providing answers.Inception is also a thought experiment.  The central conceit of Inception is that once you put a thought in someone's head it's like a virus, incapable of being removed.  In fact, attempting to not think about the idea causes the mind to just focus on it more.  This concept, a key tenet of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), is part of how our brains are wired.  Director Chris Nolan knows exactly what he's doing when the characters explain the premise.  It is the key argument between Cobb and his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard): is this life just a dream?Once you get it into your head as to which of them is right, Inception burrows into your psyche and you see all the evidence you need to reinforce the idea.  There are enough discrepancies to suspect that Cobb's stuck in a dream, but there are enough rules defining reality that indicate otherwise.  Unless, of course, you believe that Cobb is fooling himself by making up said rules to convince himself he's not in a dream when he actually is.  If that sounds confusing, Inception's done its job.Inception is a little too long in places, testing the viewer's patience as it delves four levels deep into the subconscious, each with different timeframes, settings, and plots. Part of the fun is watching the movie again to look for clues that reinforce what we secretly thought we knew all along.Me?  I'm convinced I know the truth.

Inception has a pretty straight foward plot and not so complicated concept (can be explained more).  The plot and action of the movie is very intriguing, mind-bending, and keeps you interesting throughout the entire film.  I'm very satisfied with the casting.  Leonardo DiCaprio has another brilliant performance and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fine job as well.  At first I was skeptical about Ellen Page, but was quite impressed with her performance in this movie.  Ken Watanabe did a terrific job as Saito and made his character a lot more interesting than I thought given credit to.  Inception is a very good movie, has its Cons.Like I stated earlier, Inception has a very straight foward plot and concept, but because of that I think it could've been explained a bit more, thus I thought could've been explained thoroughly in a trilogy.  There were alot of times in the movie where I thought Nolan could have been more specific.  The totem concept is simple, but the ending made it a bit confusing (If you're the architect of the Dream, can't you control the totem, regardless of knowing the texture?).  I thought there was a bit too much action near the end of the movie to the point where it made me a bit irritated.  I think if Nolan removed some of the action at the end and added more depth with the plot I would've given a 5-star without a doubt.  The ending of the movie was obviously left hanging and ambiguous for the audience to figure out, but to this point it is still leaving my friends and I with discussions of what really happened.  I like what Nolan did, but at the same time, I want a definite answer, therefore causing me to want a trilogy, or at least a sequel.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie alot and highly recommend everyone to watch it.If you love sci-fi films, you will not be disappointed.  I recommend renting it if you aren't such a big fan of sci-fi films, but if you are, this is a good movie to keep and watch a couple times if you have the urge to understand the movie more!",4,"Great Film, could be better as a Trilogy.",1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,2151,"['Inception', 'one', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'while', 'deeply', 'idea', 'subconscious', 'mind', 'reality', 'Inception', 'pretty', 'straight', 'foward', 'plot', 'not', 'so', 'complicated', 'concept', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'more', 'plot', 'action', 'movie', 'very', 'intriguing', 'mind-bending', 'interesting', 'entire', 'film', ""'m"", 'very', 'satisfied', 'casting', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'performance', 'movie', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'Saito', 'made', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'thought', 'given', 'credit', 'Inception', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Cons.Like', 'stated', 'earlier', 'Inception', 'very', 'straight', 'foward', 'plot', 'concept', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'explained', 'bit', 'more', 'thus', 'thought', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'explained', 'thoroughly', 'trilogy', 'were', 'alot', 'times', 'movie', 'where', 'thought', 'Nolan', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'specific', 'totem', 'concept', 'simple', 'ending', 'made', 'bit', 'confusing', ""'re"", 'architect', 'Dream', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'totem', 'regardless', 'knowing', 'texture', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'end', 'movie', 'point', 'where', 'made', 'bit', 'irritated', 'think', 'Nolan', 'removed', 'action', 'end', 'added', 'more', 'depth', 'plot', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', '5-star', 'doubt', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'left', 'hanging', 'ambiguous', 'audience', 'figure', 'out', 'point', 'still', 'leaving', 'friends', 'discussions', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'like', 'what', 'Nolan', 'did', 'same', 'time', 'want', 'definite', 'answer', 'therefore', 'causing', 'want', 'trilogy', 'least', 'sequel', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'alot', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'watch', 'it.If', 'love', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'recommend', 'renting', 'are', ""n't"", 'such', 'big', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'movie', 'keep', 'watch', 'couple', 'times', 'have', 'urge', 'understand', 'movie', 'more']",N/A

1305285,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B002ZG980U,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","Inception is a film about hacking into a person's mind through their dreams and either extracting information from the person, or implanting a thought into their mind.  A relatively ""simple"" concept or idea to follow.  The complexity of the film comes from the rules of what can be done, how the mind fights back, how time reacts differently and how there can be multilevel dreams (or dreams within dreams).  You may have to actually watch the movie a couple times to track all those nuances, but they are part of what makes the move great.The main story, is a tale of corporate espionage, where an idea is going to be implanted into the mind of the head of a rival corporation.  The sub-plot, basically reveals how Leonardo Dicaprio's character discovered that inception (the idea of planting a suggestion into the mind through a dream) works, and the consequences of that action.  The story can be hard to follow at times (especially the first time you see it) because it cuts back and forth between different levels of dreams and jumps between the two story lines.The acting in the film is top notch.  You see many supporting actors from the Dark Knight movies in this one.  Christopher Nolan is one of those directors like Tim Burton who uses many of the same actors over and over.  Dicaprio, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe and Marion Cotillard are the main cast.  They all do great jobs in their respective roles.  I actually think the sub-plot involving Dicaprio's and Cotillard's characters was the most intriguing part of the story, and the scenes where it was just those two interacting were very powerful.  Many people know that the ending leaves things rather open ended.  I know some people hated that you are never given a definitive answer, but I like how the filmmakers leave it up to the viewer to imagine.The audio and visual quality of the blu ray is wonderful.  If you get the two disc edition (which is really three discs because there is a DVD copy of the movie included) you get the film and a disc of bonus features.  The bonus is a documentary that focuses on the science of dreaming, then a short animated story, some artwork, then trailers and TV spots.While there is a lot of subjectivity when it comes to enjoying movies even in general, that is definitely the case for one like this.  If you are a fan of Nolan's other movies, then I would say this is definitely worth a look.  If you are just a fan of thriller/suspense movies with some action in there as well, it is also worth a look.  There are a lot of special effects in the movie, but I don't think they took away from the quality at all.  If you love the movie, and want the most bonus material, definitely get the two disc edition and not just the single disc edition.",5,Hacking the mind,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,2799,"['Inception', 'film', 'hacking', 'person', 'mind', 'dreams', 'either', 'extracting', 'information', 'person', 'implanting', 'thought', 'mind', 'A', 'relatively', 'simple', 'concept', 'idea', 'follow', 'complexity', 'film', 'rules', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'how', 'mind', 'fights', 'back', 'how', 'time', 'differently', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'multilevel', 'dreams', 'dreams', 'dreams', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'watch', 'movie', 'couple', 'times', 'track', 'nuances', 'are', 'part', 'what', 'move', 'great.The', 'main', 'story', 'tale', 'corporate', 'espionage', 'where', 'idea', 'going', 'be', 'implanted', 'mind', 'head', 'rival', 'corporation', 'sub-plot', 'basically', 'how', 'Leonardo', 'Dicaprio', 'character', 'discovered', 'inception', 'idea', 'planting', 'suggestion', 'mind', 'dream', 'consequences', 'action', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'especially', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'back', 'forth', 'different', 'levels', 'dreams', 'jumps', 'two', 'story', 'lines.The', 'acting', 'film', 'top', 'notch', 'see', 'many', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'movies', 'one', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'one', 'directors', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'who', 'many', 'same', 'actors', 'over', 'Dicaprio', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'are', 'main', 'cast', 'do', 'great', 'jobs', 'respective', 'roles', 'actually', 'think', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Dicaprio', 'Cotillard', 'characters', 'was', 'most', 'intriguing', 'part', 'story', 'scenes', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'two', 'interacting', 'were', 'very', 'powerful', 'Many', 'people', 'know', 'ending', 'leaves', 'things', 'rather', 'open', 'ended', 'know', 'people', 'hated', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'definitive', 'answer', 'like', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'leave', 'viewer', 'imagine.The', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'wonderful', 'get', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'really', 'three', 'discs', 'DVD', 'copy', 'movie', 'included', 'get', 'film', 'disc', 'bonus', 'features', 'bonus', 'documentary', 'science', 'dreaming', 'then', 'short', 'animated', 'story', 'artwork', 'then', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots.While', 'lot', 'subjectivity', 'when', 'enjoying', 'movies', 'even', 'general', 'definitely', 'case', 'one', 'are', 'fan', 'Nolan', 'other', 'movies', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'are', 'just', 'fan', 'thriller/suspense', 'movies', 'action', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'worth', 'look', 'are', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'took', 'away', 'quality', 'love', 'movie', 'want', 'most', 'bonus', 'material', 'definitely', 'get', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'not', 'just', 'single', 'disc', 'edition']",N/A

Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a mercenary who specializes in extracting information from other people's minds while they sleep, when they are in a dream state. Some mishap along these lines got him in trouble with the law in the United States, so he cannot return home to his young children. For all of his skills and taste for adrenalin, Cobb wants nothing more than to go home. So he's eager to take a job for Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe), who promises that he can fix Cobb's legal problems in the US.Mr. Saito is in the market for corporate espionage. The owner of the world's largest energy company is on his death bed, and his son Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) stands to inherit. Saito wants Mr. Fischer to break up his father's company. He wants Cobb to do something dangerous and unconventional: Instead of extracting information from his victim, he will plant an idea in the man's head, disguised so that Fischer will believe it was his own. For this mission, Cobb assembles a team of specialists: Ariadne (Ellen Page), an architect who will create the environment of the dreams, Eames (Tom Hardy), who impersonates people, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who puts people under, and Cobb's trusty assistant Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).This is just ""Mission Impossible"" in a dreamscape, and those old television shows had better writers. Cobb is a crook doing one last big job that is supposed to solve all of his problems, as if we needed another clich&eacute;. And it's all about ""family values""; the guy just wants to get back to his kids and shake the guilt-ridden memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who keeps popping up in the dreams like some demonic whack-a-mole. The movie is 2  hours long, and it's mostly filler. The entire first hour is filler: superfluous action sequences and endless conversations whose sole purpose is to explain the technical aspects of creating and entering someone's dreams. The dialogue is so stilted that the actors can barely spit it out.As he did in ""Titanic"", Leonardo DiCaprio manages to bring a certain weight to his character in spite of the fact that everything he says sounds like it was written by a 12-year-old who has only primetime television dramas and Saturday morning cartoons to draw on. Ken Watanabe, on the other hand, is completely wasted here. He has nothing to do. Ellen Page is dreadfully miscast -so badly so that I wonder if it was intended as a joke. She's like a mouse dropped into the middle of an action movie. The action sequences are so boring and purposeless that you will need reading material to keep you conscious. And the whole thing is predicated on the idea that some Japanese tycoon can control the American criminal justice system, instantly, with one phone call.

Forgetting the special effects, one has to look at the stars, the script, and direction.  Now I am different than many here, since I am in my fifties, but I do like a number of recent films, and I have seen thousands of movies in my day, covering all parts of film history, so I have plenty of remembance of films past to draw upon in comparison.  However, ""Inception"", along with ""Shutter Island"", are two examples of recent films I just don't care enough about the people portrayed, or the stars' lacking of chemistry with the audience, and both stories left me desiring more in the way of substance over flash.  (Shutter Island, I was so far ahead of the ending that it left no surprises.)  I know the special effects in Inception are remarkable...but so what?  Where's the heart?  DiCaprio's story was supposed to deliver it, but I couldn't feel anything for him or his situation.  Too much explanation, not enough love.  As a side note, I'd really like for the actor to take some time off from the serious films he has been making.  He's just so damn intense in his performance that his own personality fails to cross the screen to the audience.  His characters of later have all been so self-involved that the actor rolls himself into a ball of deep intensity...and it doesn't leave his body to get to the audience.

El-Hewie""","[7, 24]","The movie previews gave a sense of a sort of professional psychologists embarking on an ingenious discovery of the subconscience.However, the movie narrates a scenario closer to Shutter Island with a brighter outcome. The tragic loss of a mother and wife to a psychotic disorder derailed the living spouse into a posttraumatic state of derealization and despair. In the beginning, the movie was tolerable with the stranded American citizen in a foreign land to evade the notorious cold hands of the legal authorities. A desperate man yearning to unite with the children he abandoned was something many viewers could relate to. Every time I sat to watch this movie, the theater was filled beyond the ordinary, even on evenings other than the Fridays and Saturdays.The most annoying trend in the movie was making irrational and nonsensical interpretation of the subconscience and the dream state. One could easily relate to the unreal feeling of a stressed mind and the chaotic state of perception and reasoning when deep seated pain could not be suppressed. But, assigning a crew of actors to dialogues on how to manipulate the immaterial senses into material reality is foolish. When young actors rush through artificial dialogues that insult people's intelligence, boredom and disdain grow.The portion of the movie that dealt with chaotic nightmares was too long to endure and would have done much better had the dialogue on making and sharing dreams were mature or intelligent. Though one might justify nonsense during the dream state, which the moviemakers apparently have in mind, there is evident exaggeration of the potential of the unqualified and inexperienced characters in manipulating the state of mind on such short notice. A husband influencing his wife to believe in derealization is unheard of.The short and sweat scene that save the movie was the union of the traumatized father with his stranded kids.",3,Could have been much better had it refrained from nonsense.,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,1918,"['movie', 'previews', 'gave', 'sense', 'sort', 'professional', 'psychologists', 'embarking', 'ingenious', 'discovery', 'subconscience.However', 'movie', 'scenario', 'closer', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'brighter', 'outcome', 'tragic', 'loss', 'mother', 'wife', 'psychotic', 'disorder', 'derailed', 'living', 'spouse', 'posttraumatic', 'state', 'derealization', 'despair', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'tolerable', 'stranded', 'American', 'citizen', 'foreign', 'land', 'evade', 'notorious', 'cold', 'hands', 'legal', 'authorities', 'desperate', 'man', 'yearning', 'unite', 'children', 'abandoned', 'was', 'something', 'many', 'viewers', 'could', 'relate', 'time', 'sat', 'watch', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'filled', 'ordinary', 'even', 'evenings', 'other', 'Fridays', 'Saturdays.The', 'most', 'annoying', 'trend', 'movie', 'was', 'making', 'irrational', 'nonsensical', 'interpretation', 'subconscience', 'dream', 'state', 'One', 'could', 'easily', 'relate', 'unreal', 'feeling', 'stressed', 'mind', 'chaotic', 'state', 'perception', 'reasoning', 'when', 'deep', 'seated', 'pain', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'suppressed', 'assigning', 'crew', 'actors', 'dialogues', 'how', 'manipulate', 'immaterial', 'senses', 'material', 'reality', 'foolish', 'When', 'young', 'actors', 'rush', 'artificial', 'dialogues', 'insult', 'people', 'intelligence', 'boredom', 'disdain', 'grow.The', 'portion', 'movie', 'dealt', 'chaotic', 'nightmares', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'endure', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'dialogue', 'making', 'sharing', 'dreams', 'were', 'mature', 'intelligent', 'one', 'might', 'justify', 'nonsense', 'dream', 'state', 'moviemakers', 'apparently', 'have', 'mind', 'evident', 'exaggeration', 'potential', 'unqualified', 'inexperienced', 'characters', 'manipulating', 'state', 'mind', 'such', 'short', 'notice', 'husband', 'influencing', 'wife', 'believe', 'derealization', 'unheard', 'short', 'sweat', 'scene', 'save', 'movie', 'was', 'union', 'traumatized', 'father', 'stranded', 'kids']",N/A

In fact, if you're like me, you'll probably need to see it multiple times just to get everything straight. There is so much packed into it's 2 and 1/2 hour running time, it's hard to keep up with all the dialogue that explains what is going on. Christopher Nolan hasn't made a bad or mediocre movie yet (Insomnia being the weakest, but still good) and thankfully his career is just getting started. Not only has he directed some great films like Memento, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight, but he is the chief writer as well. I read he invested nearly ten years in this ambitious project and it really shows. The writing and story are very clever, even becoming a little too smart for it's own good times. It seemed like some people in my theater wanted just your typical summer movie explosions, while keeping their brains in neutral. There's no getting around the fact that this film will force you to think.It's hard to say what the movie is about without giving too much away, but to put it simply, it's about a group of people who steal important information from other people while they are dreaming. In the case of an inception, they want to put an idea in someone's head which could have a huge impact on that individual and change the course of countless other lives in the process. All this is done by creating mazes and layers in the dream world to hopefully keep that person from ever knowing someone was in their mind. At one point towards the end of the film we're seeing a dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream. Four dream layers going on at the same time, but it's so well designed I didn't have too many problems keeping up. Even so, there are a number of things I'm still confused about after my initial viewing.I can't really single out any one cast member since everyone is important to the story and they all do fantastic jobs. Like Nolan's Batman movies, the cast is filled with at least a half dozen well accomplished actors, in this case, Leornado DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Cillain Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. Not a weak link in sight.The CGI blends in beautifully when used, though I have always liked the fact that Nolan uses practical effects whenever possible. There are some really neat visuals that are creative and unique, as well as, a few action sequences that will keep you awake if the dialogue gets a bit too heavy for your tastes, including a no gravity fight scene in a hotel hallway dreamscape. What makes it even better is that it's actually Joseph Gordon-Levitt doing all those stunts in a rotating room, as I learned from HBO's behind the scenes look.Hans Zimmer's solid music score is along the same wavelenth as The Dark Knight in mood, but there's a little more emotional weight, especially towards the end of the film.Many critics are calling Inception a masterpiece. I think it's very close and easily the best film of the year so far, which you might think isn't saying much in such a lackluster movie season, but maybe this will help clarify things. Inception is jockeying with The Dark Knight for my favorite Christopher Nolan film.

Let me clear one things first, the special effects are impressive and if that is important to the viewer they wont be disappointed.If however you like a good story line, complex characters, good acting and want to leave the theater having had your boundaries challenged this will be a let down. Leonardo di Caprio as usual delivers a solid performance but that is about what can be said about the acting. Michael Caines role is so minute that it seems he was mainly included for his 'movie poster value' and most of the others left no impression at all.Particularly Ellen Page disappoints playing the young 'super student' recommended to the project by father in law Caine. She lends no depth to her character and looks mostly like a 16 year old high school student totally misplaced in the plot.. and her character is outright damaging for the overall impression of the movie.Whether it is her character that lacks substance or it is Page who fails on delivering the intended complexity is uncertain but the end result is very damaging for the movie. In general the movie lacks characters and while the overall 'headline' plot is interesting the subplots do not fail to deliver.. they are simply not there.The action scenes are professionally done but as pointed out by others they leave the viewer shrugging their shoulders as the 'villains' are really not relevant to the plot as they are mere projections and seem to drop dead 10 to each bullet while being unable to even hit the target even when outnumbering the hero's 20 to 1.The idea of mankind at some point being able to enter people's mind through their dreams is both intriguing and likely to one day be possible and as such is a good premise for a story. The message to us all to live our lives and not 'get too preoccupied' in our most unrealistic of dreams also makes sense but that's it. It could have gone so much further but it does not. Personally it does not come close to the depth of Vanilla Sky which I found thought provoking even having to endure Tom Cruise for close to hours.Not wanting to give away any of the plot considering there is so little of it (!)

1305305,A1NMUSODK9RHAT,B002ZG980U,Mr. Maybe,"[3, 4]","Inception is one of the more enjoyable films that I have seen in some time. It falls somewhere between the Matrix (methodology), Vanilla Sky (multi-layered realities) and the Usual Suspects (densely-plotted, begs more than one viewing.)The result is a thrill-ride that will leave most viewers pondering long after the credits have rolled. It is both provocative and at times mesmerizing, albeit a bit over-thought at times.Though the idea of ""dream hacking"" is hardly new, Nolan's layers to the idea make the concept seem quite fresh and the result is something unique. Instead of relying on one ""plane"" of consciousness or dreamscape, Nolan has included ""levels"", which dictate different levels of a dream and each team member has a role to serve in navigating its murky and at times unnerving landscape to accomplish their mission. Timing is critical at every level and the story is weaved together rather well, though at times it can feel a little overwhelming.In fact, the only complaint I have about the film is that at certain moments it bogs down under the weight of its own complexity and at times, unnecessarily.Part of this is because Nolan is a little unconventional in terms of how he handles exposition. Instead of laying out the rules of the world in one part of the film, he chooses to add more rules as the film progresses.In a more conventional scenario, consider the Matrix:1. First part, we are as disoriented as Neo and do not understand what is happening.2. Second part, the rules of the world are laid out by Morpheus and suddenly we understand what is happening.3. Finally, the action takes place with the audience in the full know of the established rules.With Inception, these rules unfold throughout almost the entire film, much like the plot points. The result is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it keeps the film moving swiftly and you continue to have ""ah-ha"" moments. On the other hand, it makes one feel like scorekeeping is in order to keep everything straight as you watch it.It's not so much that Nolan gives us TOO MUCH INFORMATION, as much as it that he gives us CRITICAL PIECES OF INFORMATION in VERY SMALL WINDOWS of screen time. This means one ill-timed bathroom break could compromise your entire understanding of the film.Even paying strict attention the entire time, there are still times when details lost because we're too busy absorbing info.Another common complaint is the ""ambiguous ending"", which has sparked raging debates. I personally don't mind such endings. I like coming to my own conclusions, but that's just me. Unfortunately though, I found more ambiguous moments throughout the entire film, which doesn't work as well. Again, the ""rules"" get fuzzy at times, which one should always be avoided when doing science fiction, especially as layered as this.That being said, you still feel like you've seen a ""complete film"" at the end, and it should resonate one way or another, good or bad. No one and I mean NO ONE can dispute Nolan's ambition here. It's one of the most ambitious concepts and films I've seen in years.PERFORMANCESI don't consider myself a huge DiCaprio fan. I love much of his early work but don't remember him in a memorable role since Titanic (I have not yet seen Shudder Island, which I am told he is good in.) I thought he was very strong here, with much of Nolan's script playing to his strengths.Supporting performances were exactly what I expected -- nothing Oscar worthy, but perfectly capable. Cillian Murphy is teamed up with Nolan again, and serves his character well. I feared Ellen Page would be a weak link in the film, but I was wrong. Also refreshing were the performances of lesser known talents such as Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe and Dileep Rao. Michael Caine also has a small part and it's always good to see him.My biggest disappointment was Marion Cotillard, who I thought was rather one-dimensional here. But that may have been more of a symptom of her role.CINEMATOGRAPHYIn standard Nolan fashion, Inception is generally gorgeous and well- shot. I love the fact that Nolan relies less on CGI than the average Hollywood director and still understands the value of organic action, scenes and stunts.MUSICFrankly, I was under whelmed with the score, but less because of the score itself and more so because it seems too loud and overwhelming at times. There were even times when I couldn't even hear dialogue. This is either a mixing/editing problem OR possibly because I was sitting at the back of my theater and it seemed too loud.That complaint aside, the heavy dramatic cuts that prevail in the film are effective and add to the scenes.IN CONCLUSIONI found Inception to be exciting and captivating, and easily one of the better films of 2010. Where does it rank among the all time greats? I cannot say. I do consider it a top-flight science fiction film, but I struggle to think of it as a cinematic masterpiece because I really do think it out-thought itself on too many occasions.Do I suggest you go see it? Absolutely, no questions asked. In parting I'll leave you with....RECOMMENDATION FOR FIRST TIME VIEWERS:1. The first 10-15 minutes are a little disorienting. Be patient, things will fall into place soon enough.2. As mentioned above, try and avoid bathroom breaks. It really can be the difference.3. Sit in the middle or front of the theater. As mentioned above, either by design or because of my theater, the music was too loud at times and dialogue was lost.4. Be prepared to be absorbing a lot of input. You won't have much time to process that input until the film is over.",4,"Nolan has created a provocative piece of cinema, flirting with masterpiece -- but is it?",1279670400,"07 21,

1305312,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B002ZG980U,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[5, 7]","Leonardo di Caprio (in a role and a film that bears more than a superficial resemblance to his most recent other role in Martin Scorcese'sShutter Island) plays a dream thief, hired by powerful bigwigs as a kind of corporate spy to ferret out trade secrets, not by sneaking into offices and tapping phones; rather, his job is to infiltrate the mind while the victim sleeps, and find a way to tap into his or her subconscious.  He used to be the best, but now it turns out his deep-seated guilt at a past misdeed is coming back to haunt him in his dreams even as the real life consequences of his past are catching up with him while awake.  It's a fascinating thrill ride - that is entertaining as it entertains some of the basic questions of philosophy, such as what is real, how we can know, and whether our thinking belongs to us.  It's also the latest in a long line of films that explores the implications of the fact that half our lives are spent sleeping and at least some of that time is spent wandering worlds we may not remember when we wake up.Cinema has always been fascinated by dreams, since the immersion within a film resembles nothing so much as a dream.  The lights go out and you lean back, forgetting about your worries of the day, and find yourself thrust into the midst of a situation, that somehow, almost directly, makes sense.  You find yourself meeting strangers, and yet they are almost familiar, and in moments you feel as though you know them even while you know that you have not met.  Even more, like dreams the cinema somehow caters to desires and fascinations we may not have known we possessed, obsessions we are possessed by unawares.Early filmmakers attempted to exploit this similarity between dreams and cinema, and the ease with which the audience accepts what should seem strange, once the basic logic of a situation is clear.  Experimental cinema, notably works by surrealist masterLuis Bunueland poetic filmmakerMaya Deren, explored dreams directly in their films, and even while they broke the usual rules of conventional narrative cinema, and associated images, not in accordance with the principle of continuity but in accordance with a dream (and nightmare) logic, their work somehow made emotional sense, hung together in ways that defied easy explanations.  The familiar difficulties in discerning the difference between dreams and waking life, at least when one is in the midst of a dream, caused Descartes to raise questions how we can be certain of anything; long after Descartes, the association of dreaming with doubt has been explored in a number of films, especially science fiction classics such asTotal Recall.  The tendency within such films to use dreams as a too easy resolution of plot problems by suggesting that everything we've seen may really have been a dream (usually signaled by a character waking up), has made this a cliche, that, thankfully, Nolan avoids, in part by exploring the cliche directly, and in some intriguing detail.  As his film makes clear in the opening scenes, if dreams have the impact of leading us to question our waking life, then waking up at the apparent end of a dream proves nothing.There's lots to think about here, and I imagine the Freudian philosopher Slavoj Zizek will have a field day with this one, since of course a film about dreams can't help but engage with Freud, and there are lots of Freudian elements in the film (the daddy issues, the obsession with and repression of female sexuality, the way that the repressed feminine character wields a phallic knife...).  What intrigued me most about this film, though, and makes me want to watch it again (and this is one of those rare blockbuster films that probably requires a second or third watching, but at the same time manages to make sense for the most part and be exciting to watch the first time around), is its exploration of the idea of ""inception"" - of what it means to put thoughts into another's head.  I'm especially intrigued by one of the examples in the film of a successful act of inception, and wonder whether it is really best described as a case of putting an idea into someone's head.  When the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates led people to question their ideas, when he inspired them to doubt, it's an interesting question whether he'd managed what in this film is called ""inception.""  Socrates himself claimed never to teach anyone anything, that he never put any new thoughts in their head, but claimed only to be a midwife for the ideas they already possessed.  It's worth asking whether Cobb is like Socrates in this respect.  In any case, even if this film didn't put any new ideas in my head, and I'm not sure it has anything really new to say, it still raised some intriguing questions, and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.

1305316,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B002ZG980U,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 4]","We should all stand up and cheer Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Dark Knight) for a number of reasons, whether it be for making spectacular Batman movies or always willing to up the ante in terms providing something rarely seen on the silver screen.  Case in point is Inception, which finds Nolan unfolding a masterfully dizzying and ingenius thriller, in which a master thief named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) uses technology to invade people's dreams.  Given a seemingly impossible task to pull of ""an inception"" for his last shot at redemption, Cobb and his crew find themselves way in over their heads as a battle of mental survival begins to unfold.  For everything that makes Inception so special, from the dazzling effects to the zero-gravity fistfight between Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the film isn't without its flaws.  The multilayered plot can get nigh-incomprehensible, convoluted, and downright confusing, as the film's ideas come close to running away with themselves in full gear and leaving the viewer utterly clueless.  Still though, Inception is the kind of mainstream brain-teasing film that is so incredibly rare to see these days, and it's made all the better by a superbly constructed cast that also includes Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwaite, and Lukas Haas.

1305321,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B002ZG980U,Newton Ooi,"[1, 3]","Some directors make a big splash and then slowly fade into the background as successive works become rehashes of their early successes.  George Lucas is a great example of this.  Jumping onto the scene in the late 1970s with Star Wars and then his blockbuster collaborations with Spielberg such as Indiana Jones, he has never won a Best Director award and he now focuses on just and expanding and upgrading his Star Wars Universe.  Ditto with M. Knight Shamalayan.  Then there are the directors that get better with each successive movie, with Christopher Nolan being the best example.  Starting with Memento, then Batman Begins, followed by the Prestige, and The Dark Knight, he has made his crowning achievement with Inception.Like the original Star Wars, the first and easy sign that this is one of the greatest movies ever made is the difficulty in identifying the genre of this movie.  The movie's title, and astounding and original special effects marks this as a science-fiction movie.  But then again this is not about aliens taking over the world, or machines that rise up against man.  No, this movie is about white-collar crime, corporate crime to be exact.  So then I could say this movie should be mentioned with other classic crime thrillers that feature ensemble casts like Heat, Traffic, or more specifically, Godfather I and II.  To the point, both Inception and the Godfather movies are about a family man involved in crime for the sake of his family.  Now if we look even closer, and recount the most pivotal and important scenes in the movie, we realize this movie is really about a man trying to come to grips with the death of his wife and how he was the cause of it.  This would then make the movie a tragic romance, better than any adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.Another great feature of this movie is its ability to meld multiple forms of storytelling together.  First, there is the flashback, where the past and the present join together via glimpses of past scenes.  For Inception, the flashbacks are of the main character's time with his wife.  Second, we have the story within a story.  For some movies, this might take the form of a personal rivalry occurring within a larger conflict, such as Gandalf vs Saruman in the LOTR movies.  Here, it is the dream within a dream.  Or more specifically, 4 successive dreams within a dream.  Third, there is the concept of parallel story threads that tie together.  In Inception, we have multiple story threads that run in parallel.  There is Ariadne's exploration of Dom's past, Dom dealing with the memories of his wife, the rivalry between the two energy companies that sets the backdrop of the movie, and Dom's desire to return to his children.  All of which are threaded together seamlessly by Christopher Nolan.Throw in the everything else in the movie, and what you have is a seamless blend of thriller, drama, tragedy, comedy, science fiction, etc... everything except a western.  Add in a captivating soundtrack, great dialog, and a perfect cast, and you come away with possibly the best movie of the new century.  As for the DVD itself, we have the traditional extra features such as interviews with cast members, making-of documentaries, and trailers.  However, there are no deleted or extra scenes on either the regular DVD or Blue-Ray.  This is in keeping with other movies by Christopher Nolan; the movie version is the final and only version.

1305329,A12FLZREV32JOP,B002ZG980U,Noelle Eiram,"[5, 27]","Combine an innovative director, idea, and cast. Add to that a story that questions reality, physics defying fight scenes, and wonderful special effects. What do you get? Unfortunately, with Inception, not much.Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento) directs this complex blockbuster about mental espionage. Using fancy technology, expert thief Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is able to sneak into a subject's subconscious to steal information. Inception's plot involves an even more difficult, nigh impossible, assignment: planting an idea. At the behest of the shady Saito (Ken Watanabe), Cobb and his crew plan to give Saito's economic competitor Fischer (Cillian Murphy) the impulse to dissolve his company. Complicating matters is the projection of Cobb's dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), who violently haunts his every entry into dreamland.The film is more interested in muddled sequences reminiscent of Tomb Raider than characters. In an attempt to build suspense, scenes move from one shot to another and back ad nauseum.Nolan's measured character studies and puzzle-like plots are often superior to his action scenes. But here characters, one of Nolan's strengths, are subtle to the point of dullness. They come across as mere plot devices. This may be intentional, a metacognitive device, but it doesn't make our heroes any more interesting.Slightly unhinged and haunted by a dead wife, Cobb is distractingly reminiscent of DiCaprio's role in the movie Shutter Island. Cobb's psychosis isn't enthralling enough to emotionally anchor the plot. His right hand man Joseph Gordon-Levitt looks smashing but is lifeless. Ellen Page as Ariadne, the dream architect, looks lovely but is likewise uninteresting. Tom Hardy's Eames is the cheeky but two dimensional ""forger"" who can change his appearance once in a dream. Watanabe's Saito is at first mysterious, but ultimately opaque as anyone else. Dileep Rao as Yusuf, the apothecary, is intriguingly amoral - or maybe not; his character is hardly developed. In an unsatisfying part, Murphy, whose subconscious everyone enters, excels. He stands out as the only one who evokes sympathy. Cotillard as the dangerously multifaceted Mal is also excellent.None of these characters hold many, if any, surprises. In fact, there are few twists in the entire movie , which is bizarre for a Nolan flick. Also unusual for one of his films is a lack of moral exploration. Our protagonists break into someone's mind.

1305333,A3K866GG5P9OBE,B002ZG980U,NotTheOnlyFan,"[13, 33]","I was going to let this review go because I got to see INCEPTION via Amazon's Video On Demand for free as part of a promotion.  Still, as an aspiring screenwriter and basic movie fan, I've got to say something here.(If like me you hate spoilers, scroll to the bottom of this review and read the last line.  Otherwise, I proceed as if you've already seen the film.)If you think INCEPTION is simply amazing -- you've been scammed.  I know, this is a sacrilege of modern cinema to suggest the 'genius' behind DARK KNIGHT could possibly misstep, but INCEPTION only solidifies my view that Nolan has a reality distortion field around him that Steve Job's would envy.First of all, there is a thing known in screenplays known as 'exposition'.  Exposition is when the characters explain the story to YOU to make sure you understand what's going on and what it means.  The more time the story spends explaining the story, the weaker and more convoluted the story.  Too much exposition reveals a core flaw of a screenplay -- in that -- instead of having fun with the story, the story spends too much time explaining itself.INCEPTION is wall to wall exposition.  It should have been called EXPOSITION it's so bad.  It never lets up, and the reason is NOT because the film is such a 'clever engaging 'mind-bender'.  The story never stops explaining itself to you is it's poorly constructed.There are simple work-arounds to make a story present itself more clearly.  It's called a second draft.For instance, the story uses an old device known as 'explain it to the newbie'.  The Juno actress is brought in as a newbie and the entire dreaming world is explained to her.  Piece by piece.  As it's explained to her, it's explained to us.  Get it?  You've seen it a million times.  AVATAR used it too.The problem here:  we didn't need the explanation.You think I'm nuts.  The story was confusing as hell and OF COURSE we needed the 'tell it to the newbie' trick to follow what was going on.  Salami.Was the plot really that difficult to follow?  The way it was presented, absolutely, but let me prove to you how simple to plot actually was:  a team of dream re-enginners attack a sleeping son of a businessman and insert into his mind the desire to dissolve his Dad's business.  In order to implant this idea the dream re-engineers must create three dreams within a dream to pull this off, and have a matter of minutes in the first dream, hours in the second, and weeks in the third.Isn't that basically it?  Yup.  Isn't that nice and clean and simple?  Yup.  Could that have been elegantly explained in a few opening scenes.  Yup.  Did this team need to pull in a newbie device and risk their lives on a novice?  Nope.INCEPTION takes ONE HOUR to explain what I just explained in two sentences.  Not because it's cool and clever and wildly imaginative... but because it's poorly written rubbish.Oh, I know, the fans of this film just shuttered.  Rubbish?  Impossible!  ""Why this was the director of DARK KNIGHT for crying out loud and INCEPTION made a fortune at the box office too!""Stop being a fanboy and ask yourself this:  was this Leonardo's best work?  When you think of what a great actor he can be, is this one of the movies you'll think of first?  I won't.I swear he spent the entire film with the same one pained look.  Downright constipated if you ask me.  I think he was supposed to be an emotionally distraught dude hiding a 'secret' that Juno girl eventually uncovered, but that doesn't explain his one note performance.The reason he looked so desperate and scared was that there no character to grab onto.  Leo's character was like all the characters in this piece:  one note comic book bad@sses.  Absolutely nothing more.  Pink Fluffernutter in dark suits.Modern cinema (I just hate putting those two words together) has this scam that's in nearly all 'big' movies these days -- and -- audiences consistently fall for it box office weekend after box office weekend.  It is:  any one of us could be a bad@ss, and when you join a team of bad@asses... wow... aren't you REALLY COOL.The scam of a movie like INCEPTION isn't that the idea of dream re-engineering is cool.  That's actually a good idea.  The scam is that you could be one of these people -- that you're smart enough and tough enough to swagger like the idiots in this film.  That each one of us is really just a James Bond in discounted jeans.  That's what you're really being sold here.Yes, I know, that all movies invite us into a character and give us a chance to be someone else.  But you know what?  In good movies -- in your best Bond movies -- you feel like there's an actual person there as well.  That, yes, you can pretend to be Bond at times, but at other times, you must face you're not Bond and James is.  This is why Bond can be amazing - because you must admit he's a bad@ss and you're not.When watching INCEPTION I merely see a room of nothings running around from dream to dream.  I didn't really buy that any of these people were real or mattered.For example, Leo cared very much about his wife.  He wanted to be with her.  Did we care about her?  Did WE want to be with her?  Nope.  Remember why?  She came off as a psychotic during most of her scenes.The movie pulls Juno girl out of nowhere.  She was in school but was -- oddly -- ready and willing to leave it at a moment's notice.  No boyfriend or family, no fear that some insane caper might destroy her mind and body.  Did they offer her money?  Did they promise her a place in a grad school?  I don't remember hearing any such offers.  Do you?INCEPTION isn't about really exploring this cool dream idea and making it real.  It's merely about inviting you along as a member of a team of bad@asses AND escorting you through a series of reasonably impressive CGI.  THAT'S ALL.  It's so that you can leave the cinema with a big swagger and feel cool.You know how some people simply HATE Apple for selling cool over anything else?  That just having a Mac is cool in and of itself?  That's all INCEPTION is.  Stop pontificating about how 'amazing' it was.It wasn't.  It was just okay at best.  Must NOT hurry to see cinema.Still not buying this?  Think about the plot again.  The motivation behind Leo's quest.  Leo has taken a job to break up a corporation so that it's competitor can make even bigger profits.  Did you catch that?  It's not that the corporation that's being broken up is 'evil'.  It wasn't.  So Leo is really working on behalf of an 'evil' corporation that's attacking another corporation for immense greed and profit.... yay?Wouldn't it simply be cheaper for the competing corporation to buy off the son instead of this completely insane and convoluted plot?  I know, I know, when you go see a fantastic movie you have to give them a little elbow room.  I did.  But INCEPTION demands a stadium of elbow room... just for starters.Did you notice how Juno girl was amazingly perceptive?  I mean she's not just an amazing 'maze' girl, or scientific mind, but she's also a perceptive psychotherapist?  All this in a youthful package which OH SO CONVENIENTLY is a voicebox for the smarter/aged screenwriter?  Yes, I know, she's as cute as hell, but I didn't let my hormones distract me from the simple fact she was a %100 unbelievable character.And speaking of hormones:  why wasn't Leo interested in this girl?  Or this girl interested in Leo?  Yes, I know, Leo was obsessed with his psychotic wife, and Juno girl was afraid that Leo might be a mental case.Still, there's something in heterosexual oriented movies known as 'the love interest' which Juno girl would have been perfect for... had she been cast as an older woman.  But poor INCEPTION was so busy explaining and reexplaining the world's most unnecessarily complex plot that ---- it has absolutely no time for a few genuinely emotional moments between Leo and Juno.(I should look up their real character names, shouldn't I?  But since they weren't really characters -- since the writer/director didn't bother to rewrite his opus -- I'll be similarly lazy.)But the special effects were awesome, you say like a trained monkey?  Okay, alright, let's discuss two of them to put this sorry movie out of it's misery.When Juno girl first discovers she's not on a street but really in a dream world, the entire street begins erupting.  Poof-pang-kapliff!  So COOL, right?  Wrong.  Tell me, why didn't it ever do this again when other characters were outright told that the world they thought was real was actually a dream?I bet you didn't notice that, did you?  Know why?  You were so captivated by the cool poof-pang-kapliff effect you forgave the story for making no sense.  That it didn't even follow its own rules.Remember when Juno girl folded the street up and over?  A really really COOL special effect... utterly wasted.  What if during one of the chase scenes she invoked it to flip the car behind them?  That would have been really SMART, right?  You know, using a skill they had to alter the situation?  The reason why they didn't do this ---- was because the story wasn't following it's own rules.  They were shifting at the whims of story and CGI. Face it:  this is yet another special effects feast that's exciting to watch once and never again.Overlong, way too much exposition, too many characters, all characters were Pink Fluffernutter, a stunningly convoluted plot, a hero (?) on an extremely selfish quest, a sidekick too smart to believe and too hot to ignore, a third act stolen frame for frame out of FOR HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and yet another story that invites you to 'be all you can be' so that you can leave the cinema feeling COOL with a BAD@SS swagger.INCEPTION is a scam.If you rolled your eyes at AVATAR, you'll roll

In this sense, the movie follows the conventions of Charlotte Bronte'sJane Eyre. A dark and brooding Mr. Rochester with a daunting past is here played by a blond and brooding Leonardo DiCaprio with an equally painful past. Both men are obsessed with control. What they are trying to control so desperately is the irrational sphere of emotions and dreams associated with women.Both Mr. Rochester and Leonardo DiCaprio in Inception are haunted by their wives who represent a raw, uncontrollable sexuality that threatens the obsession with control that drives these men. Both men manipulate their wives into what they see as 'insanity' and hide them either in the attic or in the basement. Both are helped in their quest to liberate themselves from the influence of their wives by a woman who embodies a completely different type of femininity: boyish, asexual, and fully dedicated to maintaining the world of logic and control at the expense of everything sexual, sensual, and irrational. The female lead in Inception is played by Ellen Page whose big head on a 10-year-old's body symbolizes her rejection of everything female.Even some small details that were presentJane Eyrereappear in Inception. A huge knife wielded by Berta Rochester is picked up by the main character's wife. A jump out of a window plays a similarly crucial role in both works.  And, of course, the feeling of male terror that comes as a response to being confronted with the threat of an uncontrollable female sexuality informs both the novel and the movie in a very similar way.What Inception teaches us is that no matter how many special effects you pile up, some things remain the same throughout history.",4,Pretty Good,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,1834,"['really', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'sci-fi', 'content', 'Inception', 'replay', 'archetypal', 'male', 'fears', 'female', 'sexuality', 'sense', 'movie', 'conventions', 'Charlotte', ""Bronte'sJane"", 'Eyre', 'A', 'dark', 'brooding', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'daunting', 'past', 'here', 'played', 'blond', 'brooding', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'equally', 'painful', 'past', 'men', 'are', 'obsessed', 'control', 'What', 'are', 'trying', 'control', 'so', 'desperately', 'irrational', 'sphere', 'emotions', 'dreams', 'associated', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Inception', 'are', 'haunted', 'wives', 'who', 'represent', 'raw', 'uncontrollable', 'sexuality', 'obsession', 'control', 'men', 'men', 'manipulate', 'wives', 'what', 'see', ""'insanity"", 'hide', 'either', 'attic', 'basement', 'are', 'helped', 'quest', 'liberate', 'influence', 'wives', 'woman', 'who', 'completely', 'different', 'type', 'femininity', 'boyish', 'asexual', 'fully', 'dedicated', 'maintaining', 'world', 'logic', 'control', 'expense', 'everything', 'sexual', 'sensual', 'irrational', 'female', 'lead', 'Inception', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'big', 'head', '10-year-old', 'body', 'rejection', 'everything', 'female.Even', 'small', 'details', 'were', 'presentJane', 'Eyrereappear', 'Inception', 'A', 'huge', 'knife', 'wielded', 'Berta', 'Rochester', 'picked', 'up', 'main', 'character', 'wife', 'jump', 'window', 'similarly', 'crucial', 'role', 'works', 'course', 'feeling', 'male', 'terror', 'response', 'being', 'confronted', 'threat', 'uncontrollable', 'female', 'sexuality', 'novel', 'movie', 'very', 'similar', 'way.What', 'Inception', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'pile', 'up', 'things', 'remain', 'same', 'history']",N/A
1305341,AHF97M45JFCB,B002ZG980U,ONENEO,"[1, 2]","Going into Inception was kind of a gamble for me as my friends and colleagues apparently know me better than I thought.  I've been hearing this is the ""one to check out"" since the day it arrived in theaters this past summer and while my friends have once again proven spot-on with their understanding of the kind of fiction I enjoy, it is always worrisome when so much hype comes my way.  I have to make a very conscious effort not to get swept up in it, as that is the sure-fire way to become disappointed with any project (however ambitious).That said I was able to suppress my tendency to become the ultimate Inception fan boy until its home-disc release then quickly snatched up the Blu-ray with reservations on picking up a Leo DeCaprio T-shirt and matching coffee mug.  To cut the chase, I enjoyed this film quite a bit but perhaps not quite to the levels my buddies assumed I would and the reason for this stems from the fact that some of its finest conceptual moments have been done before in various mediums.  However, we'll get to all that.  For now, let us get to the nuts and bolts of the picture.Inception tells the tale of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DeCaprio), an Extractor (a man who enters people's dreams to gather information).  With a team of dream-experts consisting of Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), Cobb is hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe) to implant an idea (a unproven process called Inception) into the brain of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy).If this sounds a bit muddled to you, then perhaps steering very clear of this picture will be your best bet.  For all of its intricate explanations, Inception is a venerable swirl of intense sequences that demands multiple viewings if any coherency is to be established.I liken the initial viewing experience to the first time I went though the original Matrix (another Warner Brothers piece with similar themes): The line between reality and the construct is quite hazy and the laws separating them aren't quite clearly understood despite plenty of exposition attempting to force-feed them to you.I suppose in the interest of the average viewer's sanity, Christopher Nolan was forced to integrate a technique that I personally am not too fond of here in that when the situation demands it, suddenly the rules established earlier on are said not to apply ""in this situation"", hence upping the level of danger to the characters involved.  Again though, given the complexity of the material here, it is far more forgivable than if used in a more-linear piece.And speaking of linearity, I will continue to summarize the plot without giving away any real spoilers.  Cobb could well be the ultimate mind thief except for one minor annoyance: The appearance of Mal (Marion Cotillard) who tends to turn up in Cobb's dreams and jobs, botching them out of spite.  Additionally we learn that Cobb is a proud daddy in the real world and that motivation to be reunited with his kids is the catalyst for his agreeing to such a risky assignment.In fact, so delicate is the act of incepting a persuasive motivation that it demands Cobb and company to enter into a dream within a dream within a dream! Each depth of the subconscious mind said to be far riskier, more unstable, and (what I found to be coolest of all) operating in its own relative speed.The film is pretty stunning, visually, right from the onset with undeniable attention paid in the merging of gritty, moody dialog sequences with larger-than-life mind-bending effects.  Direction is spectacular here as well with camera moves and angles that dazzle continually.  Hans Zimmer's score is spot-on as well.  Truly from a technical standpoint, the piece is a stunner.The 2.5-hour runtime happens quickly and efficiently thanks to roller coaster pacing and a bit of disconnected editing work.In all, if having gotten this far in my review and aren't sure exactly how I feel about the piece, that's a pretty accurate observation.  Parts of this one are brilliant but unlike 1998's The Matrix or the 2005 novel Human Interface (both of which present some very similar mind-bending concepts), portions of Inception (especially the twist at the end) leave a flavor of forced existentialism.  There is potential for greatness here in every single moment of the picture but appreciation for it all takes time to settle in much in the same way one doesn't guzzle a bottle of fine wine.I suppose in conclusion the goal of science fiction cinema is to entertain and there is little doubt that Inception delivers in this regard.  It is certainly thought provoking, unique and technically impeccable.  I will conclude this review with a quote from the film that best describes the experience as a whole:  ""Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize how things are actually strange.""",4,"Stylized, Ambitious, Powerful",1291766400,"12 8, 2010",2010,4881,"['Going', 'Inception', 'was', 'kind', 'gamble',

1305342,A2SA6LR78V49UV,B002ZG980U,"OrangeCrush ""Still shooting with Film!""","[1, 3]","Inception is the kind of film that you either love or hate. Just head over to any movie review website and you will see this first hand. I myself absolutely loved it. The idea of entering people's dreams is certainly not a new premise in Hollywood however, with that being said, this film take the concept to completely new heights. As the title of my review states, very few directors could have pulled this scrip off successfully. It could have easily become convoluted, confusing, and bogged down with exposition. Christopher Nolan does a remarkable job and I have no doubts that is mostly due to the control he had over this film as he wrote, produced, and directed.I don't want to give too much away in this review so ill give just the basic premise and its actually quite simple. People can enter other people's dreams and steal information. Leonardo Dicaprio's character, Dominick Cobb, is one of the best at doing just this and ultimately he winds up being hired by Ken Watanabe's character, Saito, to enter a competitors mind but this job isn't about stealing information, its about planting an idea in this persons mind, a process called Inception. Were led to believe by many characters that such a thing is not possible yet Cobb disagrees and takes the job.That's as far as I will go in regards to actual details about the film as I don't want to ruin anything for anyone. Ill simply say that it winds up being one of the most complex science fiction films I have ever seen yet Nolan never loses control with this film. Everything is masterful sewn together and the experience is second to none. Everyone gives an outstanding performance especially Leonardo Dicaprio, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Tom Berenger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Tom Hardy's performance in particular really blew me away. This film would not have been the same without him.I simply have to mention the score as it was absolutely brilliant and ultimately its one of the best scores I have ever heard. I have to admit I was surprised when I heard Hans Zimmer was the composer. Don't get me wrong Zimmer is a master but his work is usually more predictable and his scores always seem to have a similar feel to them. His work with Nolan on The Dark Knight and now Inception have really pushed Zimmer creatively and ultimately Inception is a different kind of score than I think he's ever delivered before. In all honesty if someone had come to me with this soundtrack a couple months ago, before I saw the film, and asked me to guess who the composer was, Zimmer would have been one of my last guesses. It really is one of his most original compositions.Bottom line - Inception is hands down one of the best films I have seen in years. It has an amazing story, a great cast, some outstanding special effects and one of the best scores I have ever heard. In the hands of most directors this film would most likely have been a blabbering mess but Nolan's dedication to detail makes the delivery of this film practically flawless.5 stars!!",5,A Film Very Few Directors Could Successfully Pull Off.,1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,3034,"['Inception', 'kind', 'film', 'love', 'hate', 'Just', 'head', 'movie', 'review', 'website', 'will', 'see', 'first', 'hand', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'idea', 'entering', 'people', 'dreams', 'certainly', 'not', 'new', 'premise', 'Hollywood', 'however', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'take', 'concept', 'completely', 'new', 'heights', 'title', 'review', 'states', 'very', 'few', 'directors', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'scrip', 'successfully', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'become', 'convoluted', 'confusing', 'bogged', 'down', 'exposition', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'remarkable', 'job', 'have', 'doubts', 'mostly', 'due', 'control', 'had', 'film', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'review', 'so', 'ill', 'give', 'just', 'basic', 'premise', 'actually', 'quite', 'simple', 'People', 'can', 'enter', 'other', 'people', 'dreams', 'steal', 'information', 'Leonardo', 'Dicaprio', 'character', 'Dominick', 'Cobb', 'one', 'best', 'doing', 'just', 'ultimately', 'up', 'being', 'hired', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'character', 'Saito', 'enter', 'competitors', 'mind', 'job', ""n't"", 'stealing', 'information', 'planting', 'idea', 'persons', 'mind', 'process', 'called', 'Inception', 'Were', 'led', 'believe', 'many', 'characters', 'thing', 'not', 'possible', 'yet', 'Cobb', 'disagrees', 'job.That', 'as', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'regards', 'actual', 'details', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'anything', 'anyone', 'Ill', 'simply', 'say', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'yet', 'Nolan', 'never', 'control', 'film', 'Everything', 'masterful', 'sewn', 'together', 'experience', 'second', 'none', 'Everyone', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'especially', 'Leonardo', 'Dicaprio', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'performance', 'particular', 'really', 'blew', 'away', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'him.I', 'simply', 'have', 'mention', 'score', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'ultimately', 'one', 'best', 'scores', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'heard', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'was', 'composer', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Zimmer', 'master', 'work', 'usually', 'more', 'predictable', 'scores', 'always', 'seem', 'have', 'similar', 'feel', 'work', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'now', 'Inception', 'have', 'really', 'pushed', 'Zimmer', 'creatively', 'ultimately', 'Inception', 'different', 'kind', 'score', 'think', 'ever', 'delivered', 'before', 'honesty', 'someone', 'had', 'come', 'soundtrack', 'couple', 'months', 'ago', 'saw', 'film', 'asked', 'guess', 'who', 'composer', 'was', 'Zimmer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'last', 'guesses', 'really', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'compositions.Bottom', 'line', 'Inception', 'down', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'amazing', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'best', 'scores', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'hands', 'most', 'directors', 'film', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'been', 'blabbering', 'mess', 'Nolan', 'dedication', 'detail', 'delivery', 'film', 'practically', 'flawless.5', 'stars']",N/A

I will be very brief.This is a very complex film that plays with your mind on so many levels. Nolan, has taken something very difficult and original, and open the doors for his audience to think outside of the box. Taking us on a journey, searching for the meaning or hidden meaning behind our mind. He is able to do this with such elegance, an excellent cast, superub score, beautiful & stunning filmmaking, and an awesome script.Many people these days need to be spoonfed every single thing they see, hear, and touch. If it is not going BANG BANG BANG or POW POW POW- then it is not something worth acknowledging or viewing. I feel sad for these individuals, because I am a critical thinker, you do not have to have a doctoral degree to enjoy Inception but you do have to think.For those of you who didn't get it. Or found it boring. I saw this film with my brother who is 11 years younger than me. He said it was better than Dark Knight.

1305346,A3HNBLO0KIJVTS,B002ZG980U,"paper tiger ""Adriel August""","[370, 474]","BLU-RAY:I just finished watching Inception for the second time. The Blu-ray is amazing. The PQ and AQ are perfect in every way. I did notice that the video was not as sharp, crisp, or clear as The Dark Knight. However it was very, very good. The audio is very bass heavy, but is up there with some of the best Blu-ray AQ I have heard. The movie was stunning all the way through and after another watch it is just as good if not better than the first time I watched it.The special features are great. Disc two is full of behind the scenes and a dream documentary by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On the first disc there is expansion mode which takes you behind the scenes and shows you each special effects scene and all which went into creating it. It is really interesting to watch. Very little CGI special effects were used on this film. They actually did most of the stunts or build huge models. It was really cool to watch.MOVIE:I went into Inception thinking very positive and with high hopes that this will be one of my new favorite movies. I based this simply on the trailer. I was not let down in the slightest, and I was blown away by the originality and creativity of the film. The directing, acting, and cinematography were all amazing. It is a beautiful film.After seeing Inception I will have a hard time watching any other movie ever again. Anything else would seem boring and useless. I went to see The Expendables in theaters. Horrible. I couldn't understand what the interest in this film was. It was just violence and explosions; No story or plot. Just useless violence.I can see where people may think of Inception as something similar to the theme of the Matrix. It sort of has the same basic idea of people being hooked up to a machine, leaving their bodies and going somewhere else. Besides that, there wasn't much at all which reminded me of the Matrix. Each scene held its own new originality in the most creative way as possible.As far as Inception being hard to follow... well, I had no trouble following it at all. The three friends and my eleven-year-old brother had no trouble following it. I believe people who are more open minded would follow and understand it much better than people who are not willing to believe the story. Parts are incredible to believe, but you have to be open and let the story take place.The creativity and attention to each shot and scene really paid off in the end. The film was perfect in every way in my opinion. Things were done which we have never seen before and it was done so well. It has set a new standard for films, at least in my mind. The directing style is similar to The Dark Knight, however they seemed to give Christopher Nolan more creative freedom with Inception.The acting was top notch. I liked that Leo's character, Cobb, seemed a little weak minded at times. Usually he plays a strong character, but in this film his character had a weakness. Joseph Gordon-Levitt played a larger role than I expected. I was impressed with his character as well. Most of the crazy stunts, anti-gravity, jumping off walls and fighting people in mid air kind of stuff were with his character. Very cool. Ellen Page played a young architect which is hired to build cities within a person's mind. She did a great job as well. Each character was so well thought out and everyone added just the right amount to perfectly blend each character into the story.If you're a fan of films which touch on subjects which most movies dare not go, you owe it to yourself to see this film. You won't be disappointed. I am very glad I got to see it on the big screen.VideoVideo codec: VC-1Video resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 2.40:1Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1AudioEnglish: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1French: Dolby

Highley ""the_projectron""","[0, 0]","Having more certainty of Christopher Nolan's originality than his film's absolute cohesion, I really wish there might have been some way to approach this material as a trilogy because there is simply TOO much to establish in a single-sitting.  So much of the dialogue is so heavily leaden with exposition that it was difficult to actually connect with the characters speaking it.  There were so many characters to introduce that there was little or no time to actually develop them.  And, most troubling, there was NEVER any explanation as to HOW one actually enters someone else's dream, and THAT was something that NEEDED to be explained!  Were the characters in someway psionic or did the little machine they carried in a briefcase do all of that for them?  Had this been a trilogy, then maybe some of these issues could have been explained as courageously as they were executed.  Inception is a good movie, but had the concept REALLY been hammered-out in advance it could have been a cornerstone in cinema history!I find myself still wondering about the true motives of Saito. The target within whom he has hired Dom Cobb's team to implant a self-destructive yet compelling notion never once showed even the faintest hint of the ruthless aggression that Saito, himself, routinely displays. One wonders if Saito's true motives were to delve deep into the psyche of Cobb rather than that of his announced target. And, to complicate matters even further, just why is Ariadne so insistent on being on Cobb's infiltration team? Was the real person she was trying to lead out of the labyrinth Saito rather than Cobb? She was, afterall, recommended by Cobb's father-in-law; what reason would HE have to believe his son-in-law innocent of his daughter's death when every authority who investigated the case believes him guilty?When I began asking myself these and other questions, I began to get the sense that Cobb's point-of-view may be no more reliable than Leonard's in Memento. I cannot help but wonder if Cobb's mind was the actual target for infiltration in order to bring HIM to justice for the death/murder of his wife.  What better way to assess his state of mind than to personally witness his very own memories of these events?In any case, if you enjoy thought-provoking art that raises more questions than it answers, then Inception is definitely a film worthy of an evening at the theater. It allows the demons that haunt the protagonist, and quite possibly other characters as well, to manifest in ways so consistent with the film medium that I wonder if this story would even work if presented in a purely written way. Subjective doesn't even begin to describe this film; there is almost no way one can spoil this story by droping a tid bit here or a tid bit unless you insist on taking said tid bit at absolute face value.

1305360,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B002ZG980U,P. Hardy,"[0, 0]","I was first introduced to Inception during a five-minute preview before the showing of Sherlock Holmes (2009) and was mildly intrigued by the snippets that were presented in the teaser trailer. Basically, I assumed the film would be another Prestige (2006) and came to the conclusion that Ken Watanabe was a 'magician' of some sort and was involved in 21st century espionage (among other things) and that Leonardo DiCaprio was assigned to hunting him down. Of course, when I heard that the film was about invading the subconscious of the dreamer and stealing or implanting ideas in the mind, I wondered how the hell that would turn out. So, on a rather spur of the moment my family and I decided to see this film and went off to the theaters.Sufficed to say, I enjoyed this movie and found it to be one of the simplest films Nolan has directed since Batman Begins (or even Insomnia) despite his efforts to confuse his audience with his ideals and opinions of how the mind works when a person is asleep and dreaming.The story, simply put is this:Inception follows the tale of Dominic Cobb and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt), thieves for hire sent to steal an ideal from a man called Saito (Ken Watanabe). When their job is botched by the sudden, but not unexpected, appearance of Dominic's deceased wife, Mal (which, for whatever reason, is pronounced like ""Maul""), they plan to lie low for awhile until the incoming heat from the man they were hired by blows over. Instead, Saito reappears and offers Dominic a deal he can't refuse: The chance to return to Stateside and be reunited with his children, whom he 'abandoned' when proper authorities decided to label him as his wife's killer. All he has to do is infiltrate the mind of a man who is on his way to controlling the the most powerful energy conglomerate in the world and convince him to dissolve his dying father's company via ""Inception"" (the ability to implant an idea into the mind of a dreamer and have them believe the idea was theirs). Despite Arthur's reservations towards the job, naturally, Dominic says yes and assembles a motley crew of former/new associates and one young college student named Ariadne (Ellen Page) who steps in to become their ""architect"" (a person who creates a dream scape to fool a dreamer into believing their in the real world and not dreaming) and prays the job gets done without a hitch. Naturally, it doesn't and when the group find themselves stuck in their target's mind (with one of their own mortally wounded) with no possible way of escaping, they bite the bullet and decide to go through with the plan in hopes of escaping back to reality.What follows afterward is Christopher Nolan's ""How to traverse a Streamlined Subconscious 101 during a botched mission"" with a combination of your typical action/adventure summer fare. And such a description is not to say that the film was terrible. On the contrary, it was a very composed film and did it's job well. However, in concerns to the dream scape universe presented in the film, I'm afraid that was far too simple and not at all like a dream. While Inception's initial (and obvious) inspiration may have come from ""The Matrix (1999)"" --- a film that does a superb job of playing with the themes of dreams vs. reality and bending said reality ---, it truly fails on that level to capture the same sort of surreal atmosphere. Dreams are nonsensical and jagged at best and therefore, cannot be as normal as they were presented in this film. But I suppose for the sake of coherency, it had to be. And while the idea is hinted a lot at in the film, there is never a moment in the film where the characters ever question their reality (outside of that one sequence with Ellen Page in the beginning), whether or not they are dreaming, it's just mentioned alot.That aside, a lot of people have said ""You'll need to see this film a couple times to truly understand it"" and that's simply not the case (at least not for me anyways). As mentioned before, this is one of Nolan's simpler films. It doesn't mean to surprise likeBatman BeginsorThe Prestigedid in 2005 and 2006, but it does test your level of patience and dedication to it's storyline with it's length, much likeThe Dark Knightdid in 2008. This film, like TDK, is a half-hour too long and really needed to be trimmed down.Another downside is that, while the performances in the film were great, a few of the characters are, perhaps, too monotone for their good. With the exceptions of Ellen Page's Ariadne (who, next to Joseph Gordon Levitt, is the highlight of the film with her everyman character), Tom Hardy's Eames (who's character can be characterized as that ""smart-arse Brit with a mind for deception, 'Sherlock Holmes'-esque disguises, a taste gambling and fast women"") and Cillian Murphy and Dileep Rao, who's characters are as human as they can be in a Nolan film, actors like DiCaprio, Watanabe, Levitt and Marion Cotillard (who plays Mal) have characters that could easily be exchanged between them because their devoid of any real personality outside of ""serious business"" (welll, maybe not Cotillard).DiCaprio's Dominic is simply defined by the loss of his wife and the need to return home to his children, outside of that there isn't much to him beyond that broodish facade. It pulls on the heartstrings to be sure, but it's not a character I became particularity attached to or concerned about. Levitt's Arthur, as smooth and likable as he is, is just another straight-faced character, brilliantly realized within the context of his ability to act with so little and one of the best action sequences I've seen in a long time (he also steals every sequence he appears in).The special effects waver between rather telling (folding the city on top of itself, the limbo level) and near seamless, action sequences are gripping and brilliantly choreographed (The Zero-Gravity fight on the second dream level). Hans Zimmer's score, while not his best in the least, takes a cue from Sherlock Holmes (with a touch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 See: ""Mombasa"") and manages to be both different from his usual soundtrack and suits the atmosphere of the film as well.Overall, I loved the ideas and most of the execution presented in this film. Inception manages to be somewhat original with it's premise and will without a doubt dazzle audiences for its two and half hour stay on the Silver Screen. --- [A 4 out of 5]",4,"""I'd hate to see out

Ultimately I decided not to watch it in the theatre and now I'm glad that I didn't miss anything! Yes, the visual effects of the film are nice, but even those are less than what I thought they might be, and if you have seen the trailers for the film you've already seen the best visuals the film has to offer.The story was interesting at the outset, but even at its most convoluted times was still never dynamic. I kept waiting for the film to pull me in and give me that emotional connection resulting in that rare cinema buzz you sometimes get from that type of film that takes you on a journey that engages you, but this film never delivered, at least not for me.I suppose there was some effort to try to take you down the philosophical path of how it can sometimes be difficult to separate fantasy from reality, but even this path was barely a scratch in depth. It could simply be that the writer or director, whoever was most responsible, lacks depth themselves in order to bring this film into something more than surface-level eye candy.The film was certainly adequate enough from a visual standpoint, and Di Caprio is always great - best actor of my generation I think. The rest of the acting is adequate but nothing special. The film is little more than eye candy with nothing important to say.Blockbuster films like this one I tend to judge more harshly than I do a film that is not a blockbuster or to which I have little or no expectations of.

He writes and directs many of his movies himself, and the movies are completely original.  I have not seen many of the other movies up for best picture, but I don't see this one is not the clear favorite.  Social Network was good, but not best picture worthy.  This movie surpasses all the hype that went along with it and is, just like it's director, in another realm altogether.I cannot say much more about this movie that hasn't been said after it's release, but this movie had me enthralled from start to finish, and the finish is what proved to me why it was so special.The acting was amazing as well.  Leonardo Dicaprio has grown up since his days on Growing Pains, who knew the sarcatic homeless kid who outsmarted Mike Seaver would become a superstar.  Not to mention the alien kid becoming a well known actor as well.This movie made me think, just like another film by Nolan, Memento.  Both of them totally blew me away.  Those people who say they don't understand it, really must have a hard time focusing.  It's quite clear if you keep yourself immersed in the movie.  The ending is open for interpretation, but I don't think I would've liked it as much without it.  That is what separated this movie from any other.This movies ending is the best ending of any movie out there.  I challenge anyone to find one better.  I didn't think any movie could touch The Usual Suspects ending, but this one blew it out of the water.The whole dream within a dream idea in this really proved interesting, and the idea of trying to plant an idea in someone's mind by having them think of it themselves.

Most of the dreams were way too detailed and clear, and seemed too strict in following the logical patterns the film set for them.  Most of the dreams lacked the surreal touches, the dreamy fuzziness as portrayed in other much simpler films like ""Dreamscape"".Because of this I just couldn't completely buy-in-to the story, I never 'lost' my self in the story.  And I think for me this made some of the more complex details of how the logic behind dreams operated seem somewhat distracting and annoying... for example, Having to figure out why some of the characters seemed to easily leave the lower 'Purgatory' dream level and others apparently could not.Also some important rules followed by the 'induced' dreams of the film appear to only apply to those types of dreams and not to natural dreams...  I know this may seem obvious but I think the film unnecessarily blurred the line between the 'nature' of the  induced and natural dreams leading to some confusion.For example: If I have a 'natural' dream about having a dream, i.e. the so-called layered dreams (I've actually had dreams like this),  My brain won't operate at some hyperactive level causing me to have days, months or even years worth of experiences while only sleeping for hours (as the movie said could happen in their induced layered dreams).Another thing I had a lot of trouble buying into was that the characters involved in multi-layered dreams left some sort of 'ethereal' bodies asleep at the lower dream levels (while they are experiencing an upper level).They have one (Just one) 'real' body in the real world, that's all.e.g. I could go along with the idea that the 'Chemist' might experience the others as being in a drug induced sleep while he's driving the van during that wild chase scene.But why would the others have any connection/dependency-on the Chemist's perception of their sleeping bodies at the lower dream level?For example, If one of the character's faux asleep-body was shot in the head while in the van, why should this have any effect on them (once they've passed on to and are experiencing another dream level)?In other words, when their minds move on to another dream level I see no logical reason why they would be leaving behind some bizarre dream-sleep body(ies) at the lower levels.They might DREAM that they are waking up from one level to the next but to say that they actually leave behind some sort of sleeping dream-bodies seems silly to me.--------------- ------------Perhaps the single most dream-like scene of the film was when Cobb was trying to escape from some pursuers and he gets stuck in an alley-way which narrows to an extraordinary extent.  In a nightmare it isn't uncommon to have something inexplicably slow your progress while trying to escape from pursuers.The problem with this scene is that Cobb wasn't in a dream when this happened...  or was he? ;-)That's one aspect of the film I liked a lot, there seemed to be hints now and then that we are still actually watching a dream when the characters were supposedly awake...Didn't the Cobb character say there was a danger in composing a dream too close to your real-life because you could no longer distinguish between the two?",3,Worth seeing.

1305375,A3UT7I4QCP1FQR,B002ZG980U,"Rajesh Motie ""Xanatos Planned This Signature""","[19, 44]","Christopher Nolan had a really interesting idea with Inception. It's basically an inverted heist flick with a gimmicky backdrop. Now, that would be fine, if 1, the gimmick in question made any sense, and 2, the film did not make itself out to be more complex than it is. The movie has the tagline ""your mind is the scene of the crime"", and reviewers have been raving about how awesomely mind-screwy it is (neither description matches Inception). Inception is straightforward, and most ways that it could have deviated from that don't work.Why should someone knowing that an idea is not theirs prevent them from pursuing the idea? The Amazon user SuperHiro put it perfectly when they said ""I may not have originated the idea of me wanting to be a billionaire, but does that mean I still won't try to do it?"" But why do they even need to go into Fischer's head to convince him to break up the empire? It would probably have been simpler to just manipulate the guy in real life or something. All of this makes the whole movie feel pointless.There were a lot of problems, inconsistencies, and loop-holes with the dream concept. They say that when you induce dreams, the more dreams that are within dreams, the more hyperactive your brain has to work. In the real world not much time at all would pass, but in the dreams, it could be weeks, months, and even years. But layered dreams happen in real life all the time to lots of people. How come ""natural"" dreams don't have this problem? Doesn't add up to me. Another thing is that when you move on to another layer of the dream, you leave behind an ever-sleeping version of yourself. I suppose this makes sense, you have to go to ""sleep"" while in a dream to access another layer of it, but the weird thing is, whatever happens to your sleeping body happens to the other-level you. Gravity changes, environmental changes, injuries, this affects your body in the other level. But why should the left-behind bodies have this effect? I see no reason for this to happen at all.Lot of things had me scratching my head. How does Ariadne being able to draw a maze in two minutes that takes one minute to solve (which she drew on her third try) mean that she qualifies better than experienced adult architects? How does it prepare her for the dreams? Why does Ariadne need to go on the actual mission with the team? How the heck does Eames shape-shift? Why is the limbo pocket space filled with only Cobb's ideas no matter whose dream the team is in? Why would only Cobb's mental problems affect other people's dreams? If ""kicks"" can affect multiple dream levels and the flight attendant is in on everything, why doesn't she just push them out of their chairs on the plane? When Cobb was stuck in limbo, why did he use inception to convince the other person to leave by suicide, thus causing the idea to stick with the person forever, ruining their life. He could have killed them just like that, they would have woken up quite fine. Why do they keep saying that inception is impossible? They say that the mind can always trace the source of an idea and that it rejects whatever it doesn't want, but that sounds really half-baked to me. After all, Cobb did an inception effortlessly by himself.Why doesn't Fischer recognize Saito? They're corporate rivals. Fischer should know who he is, he is the head of Fischer Enterprises and it's made quite clear that he has done much work for the company already. He goes on long business flights regularly and has gotten training to protect himself against extraction. So Fischer should have recognized Saito on the plane. It can be argued that he would notice him in an early dream level, but not in the later ones, because dreams cause confusion. But there are absolutely no sings of Fischer realizing Saito is on the same plane as him, or that Saito is invading his early dream levels, or that Fischer has become bewildered by later dream levels and completely accepts Saito like it's nothing. This Fischer/Saito thing is one big blatant plot-hole.On the side of characterization, Inception fails. DiCaprio's character is alright and is a reason for the viewer to be emotionally involved, but I feel like I've seen his story before. And what about everyone else? I think that Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur was a very flat character. Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao were really funny to me, but they didn't have enough to do and felt underused and underdeveloped. Ken Watanabe actually plays a larger role than I expected and in my opinion was very interesting, but again, underused and underdeveloped. My biggest character problem lies with Ellen Page as Ariadne. Cobb already has an architect at the beginning, but that guy is quickly written out. How convenient. The only reason Ariadne exists is so that the movie can explain everything to the audience. Often times the other characters have to stop and communicate new aspects to her, not to very good effect on the pacing. Outside of using her to spoon-feed the viewer, Inception doesn't really have anything for Ellen Page to do. Her presence is annoying and prevents the movie from being more fast and fluent.Most of the time the action it just the heroes blasting away at gunman projections of the subconscious, and nothing ever happens to them even though they're at point blank range. The shoot-outs, or probably just the action scenes in general, tend to drag on and I lost a lot of my interest. It doesn't help that none of the dreamscapes are all that different from real life. I was honestly expecting a lot less hard physics to apply. I thought that actually going and planting an idea would be cooler. I guess I expected more adventurous/dynamic/creative things to happen. One of the reasons that the protagonists are not taking advantage of the dreams was that the mind's projections would sense an abnormality and attack the intruders. Thus it would be a bad idea to make crazy structures or materialize objects and stuff. But the projections attacked relentlessly anyway, and this strict rule prevents Inception from doing more than just several truly imaginative things. But this brings up more questions. If Ariadne is the one building the dream worlds, why doesn't she just include an area that would make projections die? She does have control over a person's psyche, so it doesn't seem like projections should really be that much of a big deal. It also has to be wondered why projections wouldn't automatically notice that they are in a constructed dream and that new comers have been placed inside with them.Inception was constantly advertised by reviewers as a big riddle that you have to figure out yourself. This made me assume it was going to a movie you can watch again to clue in on subtle hints. But there's no riddle, no complex mystery, nothing like that. Inception is simple and certainly not as smart is it wants to be. As if to somehow redeem himself, Christopher Nolan tried to pull a ""twist"" ending, but don't be fooled, it's nothing of any substance. To explain it I'd have to get into spoilers, so look out.SPOILER ZONE BEGINSSo at the end, Cobb gets back home and he sees his two kids doing the same thing in the same location as when he saw them last time. He's got his totem, he puts it to spin on the table, and it's wobbling, so it looks like it's going to fall soon...and then black smash cut, roll credits. What? Woo, look at us, we have an ominous ending that can be interpreted in different ways! No, fail. Look, the totem looked like it was going to fall down, and in dreams it's not even allowed to get to that point. Plus, Cobb finally gets to see the faces of his kids again, and he was always distracted from that in his dreams, so this should be reality. It also appears it's just a coincidence that Cobb's kids are in the same place doing the same thing, because in this last scene it's confirmed they're actually wearing different clothes, and the first time they appear in the movie they're played by younger kids. And how could he still be dreaming anyway? What, someone went and made a dream world for him? I don't think so. They would have to create an entire LABYRINTHINE PLANET. Lastly, even if it's all just a dream, then what the hell is the point of that? Where's the payoff from over two hours of film? A dream ending would be way too gimmicky and contrived. If it's all a dream, it's never going to be explained, thus it's a big slap in the face for the viewer.SPOILER ZONE ENDSI would not have been so disappointed with Inception if it had just capitalized on its own simplicity and made its own unique/cool parts logical. If you're looking for a generic action movie that can make you feel intelligent for following it, go ahead and check out Inception, you might be compelled to jump on the bandwagon. As for anyone else, don't waste your time.4 out of 10",2,It shouldn't take itself so seriously.,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,8851,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'had', 'really', 'interesting', 'idea',

1305376,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B002ZG980U,R.A. McKenzie,"[2, 3]","Endlessly inventive.  Thoroughly engaging.  Fascinatingly complex.  Thought-provoking.  Very entertaining.These are the phrases I can apply to each of Christopher Nolan's films.  ""Inception"" is his 7th feature film, and it is a well-crafted thriller of the highest order.  It's almost impossible to describe this movie, because there really isn't a whole lot like it.  Sure, there are elements of ""The Matrix"" when the characters dig into their own minds, or the James Bond 007 series when the action sequences kick into the final stretch of the story.  But ""Inception"" cannot be reduced to those other pictures; the story is unique because of HOW it's told.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb (the same name for Nolan's thief in the criminally-overlooked ""Following"").  Cobb is a thief of the most unusual kind: He's paid to steal the secrets of powerful men.  From the getgo, ""Inception"" challenges and demands you give your full attention.  Fans of ""The Prestige"" and ""Memento"" will sink into this mindset relatively quick, as Cobb's attempts to steal from Saito (Ken Watanabe) become increasingly complicated when a few characters begin to resist Cobb's mental theft.  The targets begin to shoot back.  A woman from Cobb's past sabotages his efforts.  The dream world begins to collapse.After the operation has gone sour, Saito still enlists Cobb to work for him to complete another job is by assuring him that he will be allowed to see his estranged family after being exiled for reasons I won't reveal.  The catch: Cobb and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) must perform 'inception', meaning to insert an idea into Saito's rival for his own personal gain.Viewers may become initially lost at the outset, but like watching a Shakespearean play or sitting through a season of ""The Wire"", if you remain patient and just catch the jist of the scene, you'll catch the hidden subtleties as the story progresses.  ""Inception"" isn't an impenetrable mind-bender, but it moves at a swift pace for its 2 and 1/2 hour duration.  Thankfully, there is an early sequence where Cobb enlists a new architect (Ellen Page), where we begin to understand how this dream invasion is even remotely possible.  What are the rules?  The objectives?  The risks?  This sequence where Paris is reassembled in front of our eyes is very well-written for the viewers' convenience.As Cobb assembles a team to invade Saito's target, his inner demons and complexities reveal their ugly heads as the planning begins.  As with most action thrillers with a team of protagonists, things go horribly wrong.I don't want to reveal what exactly happens and why it happens, but I think it's fair to tell you that the first half is pretty much the setup of the Inception, while the second half is the execution of the plan while the team faces unforseen risks.  Throw in Cobb's confrontations with his dark past while immersed in the dream world, ""Inception"" becomes a very tricky balancing act of drama and thriller, and Christopher Nolan is equal to the task....Mostly...Before I get into my quibbles with ""Inception"", I want to be clear:This is a first-rate picture from a masterful filmmaker.  Audiences should see it, and audiences will certainly enjoy it.Where ""Inception"" is going to be nitpicked is whether this is indeed a masterpiece, and in my opinion, it isn't.  This has nothing to do with the insurmountable praise from ""The Dark Knight"" or the indie smash ""Memento"".  The flaws from ""Inception"" belong only to ""Inception"", regardless of Nolan's prior work.There is one basic element that I thought could've been better:""Inception"" is simply too long.  To address Nolan's previous work, his two Batman features were lengthy pictures as well.  But in those two movies, the plot was constantly moving and evolving.  There simply wasn't any way to keep all of those storylines and make the movies shorter.  ""Inception"" would be just as, if not more, effective if it were trimmed a bit.  The stunning action sequences are simply too long in the final act, and even the dramatic revelations and conclusions are too long.  Considering how the story ends and where our characters end up, the film's 144-minute length isn't fully justified.Everyone will admire ""Inception""'s exciting action stunts & shootouts, and the dramatic payoff of the story.But I believe most fans will love one of those elements, and simply 'LIKE' the other.  I'm not convinced that ""Inception"" is going to be universally praised for both of those aspects.However, with ""Inception"", it's biggest problem is that it has too much of a few good things.  In this case, less would've been more.  But whereas most blockbusters don't earn their lengthy running time, ""Inception"" is a such a terrific piece of entertainment that it's not a deal-breaker.  I once read a quote from Roger Ebert, ""No good movie is too long, and no bad movie is too short.""  Christopher Nolan's latest work is a very good film, and it is a bit too long.  But Nolan's enormous talent is stunning enough to tolerate the excesses of his latest acheivement.  Ellen Page's rookie becomes so drawn into the dream exploration because ""It's pure creation"", and so are we.""Inception"" is a marvelous piece of pure creation from one of the cinema's most gifted talents.",5,"Inception Is ""Pure Creation""",1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,5260,"['Endlessly', 'inventive', 'Thoroughly', 'engaging', 'Fascinatingly', 'complex', 'Thought-provoking', 'Very',

Once you understand the multi-layer scenarios, you also start to see a number of holes.  The film is worth watching and better than most, yet over a period of years, I do not see it making its way into the top ten of many critics' lists.  The premise is not entirely original (see Dreamscape from a few decades ago).  The film asks us to believe that if a person dies during some level of their dreaming, they will die in reality -- much in the same way that Star Trek's Hologram room could prove lethal if set to maximum -- much in the way of ""Brainscan,"" an almost two-decades old movie -- much in the way of ""The Matrix.""  In all cases the notion is ludicrous.  So is the idea that someone could ""live"" 50 years at a deep level of sleep while in reality the subject might have been unconscious for a few hours or whatever.  The life-threatening scenes encountered by the inceptors seemed like clippings from a James Bond film.  Not only that but with their very lives in peril (within the context of this script), you'd think there would be more at risk than the success or failure of a business espionage endeavor.  Once you start to dissect some of the premises of ""Inception,"" you'll realize a good portion of it is pure hokum.  At a first viewing, you will be kind of dazzled, perhaps confused, but, nevertheless, entertained in a way that is almost subliminal.

1305378,A2ZQXJD7YUIEHB,B002ZG980U,rash67,"[2, 3]","Inception is a great movie, one of the best action movies of the year. It is nothing if not a concept movie, science fiction which often seems on the brink of fantasy, but actually has some basis in reality.Fast paced from beginning to end. Inception is based on the idea of Lucid Dreaming, a difficult to master skill wherein the practitioner develops the ability to consciously recognize within their dream that they ARE dreaming and then manipulate the content of their dreams. This is a real endeavor which takes a great deal is discipline and years of practice to achieve. People do this! see ""Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming"" by Stephen Laberge.  But they only can manipulate their own dreams, if that.The plot here, within giving away much you won't see in the first ten minutes, is the hero Cobb (another hard role for Leonardo DiCaprio, like Shudder Island) is trying to alter the dream not only of himself, but of someone else, an industrial magnate, Fischer (Cillian Murphy), using a team of dream architects and manipulators - Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Eames (Tom Hardy), Ariadne (Ellen Page), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao). Sort of industrial espionage. This part is Sci-fi - it can't be done, at least not now. To borrow an information Technology concept, the magnate has nested dreams, dreams within dreams within dreams, five layers deep, like nested do-loops! Cobb and the Dream Team seek to implant an idea deep within the subconscious of the target and give him the idea he thought of it himself.Inception has fabulous special effects, as you might imagine. The actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt  (Arthur),  playing a dream manipulator, was on David Letterman's Show talking about this movie and he said the director Christopher Nolan made minimal use of the omnipresent Blue Screen CGI technology for special effects and actually had Gordon-Levitt and others suspended from wires instead, in many dream sequences, to make them weirder and less, well special-effecty than CGI. There is a spectacular special effect in Montmartre, in Paris, where a dream architect folds the whole city over on itself like a half peanut butter sandwich! This effect is certainly blue screen CGI, but others where the director turns the whole room was done with actors, wires and a turning room like the Fred Astaire movie where he dances on the ceiling!The story? Five layers deep in nested dreams the motivations get pretty murky. There's a lot of car chases, poorly motivated bad guys as we deal with Cobbs subconscious contents/demons.

I managed to watch this farce for about half an hour, I desperately wanted to give it a chance, but every passing minute is such an insult to my intelligence that I cannot carry on. Then I tried again to continue, because I thought it's not fair to rate a movie without watching it to the end. But then again, I'm not a masochist.This film is the perfect example of how movie success depends hardly on movie quality, but almost solely on marketing. The same happened with the Matrix a few years back. Farcical setting, totally unrealistic story, but great marketing: Box office success.You probably already know the deal, unfortunately I was unsuspecting before I tried to watch it: Getting into other people's dreams, creating a believable world in the dream where multiple dreamers can interact with each other, and in this way, collect important information from the mark. Of course the dreams also have dreams within, and it's hard to know what is real and when your're dreaming.Whatever. No idea why anyone would WANT to watch this, other than because of the hype. But the hype has very little to do with the quality of the film. This film's whole focus is on the farcical notion of creating dreams for people, and especially, interacting with other characters in the dream who are dreaming the exact same dream. If the film were not so consumed by this outragous technicality, and it had some character and heart, some sort of purpose, I could probably let slip the ridiculousness of the whole theme. I have been known to enjoy the odd sci-fi. But this lacks any heart, all it does is try to look smart.I find it grossly unfair that this junk rates above 9 on IMDB and 4.5 stars on Amazon.

So I figured I'd wait 24 hours to see if this euphoria has passed... looks like it hasn't. Bram Stoker's Dracula was my favorite movie, I now have to reconsider.Inception is an AMAZING movie. For one, it has one of the most interesting plots I've ever had the good fortune to witness. Look at it. Stealing/planting ideas through dreams. Entering others' dreams. Completing tasks in dreams. This stuff is what I like. The plot was very complex and multi-layered, and therefore there was so much to offer in the plot. Not a single moment went by where I wasn't interested.The visuals are AMAZING. I was blown away when Cobb was showing Ellen Page how the dream world worked, with the folding city. As well as the scenery in the Arctic. The sets looked vivid and gorgeous. They complemented the film's great plot and IMO, were very creepy and brooding too.Another reason the movie is so great is because it uses ambiguity THE RIGHT WAY. A lot of filmmakers (*ahem* Michael Haneke, I'm looking at you!!!!) think that senseless manipulation equals a great movie (to a lot of people nowadays think it does and because of it, they rave about it like it's second coming of Jesus), and this one doesn't senselessly manipulate the viewer. It challenges the viewer to piece together the puzzle and find out the answer. Yet it has plenty of exciting action and suspense to offer, and it doesn't beat you over the head with the theme. You're getting your adrenaline up during the action while simultaneously piecing the puzzle together.The ending. WOW. I'll be thinking about this one for at least a month. It uses ambiguity the right way too- I am personally leaning towards the ""he's still dreaming"" side, but I definitely like the ending a lot because he could be in the real world too. My friend and I both decided last night that he's lost his mind and is in limbo, but that's what makes the ending so powerful. You interpret it your own way. See this is what I wish a lot of the pretentious directors who go for the ""open to interpretation"" approach did more often- end it AFTER the resolution of the conflict and then leave the one element up to the viewer to decide. It can be interpreted many ways.The movie is VERY long. 2 hours 28 minutes. But it didn't feel long at all!! I seriously thought it was only 1 hour 45 minutes. That's the thing, when you're so into a movie, when your attention is drawn to it for that long, when you're trying to piece together the puzzle, time flies so fast. I didn't even get up from my seat once and mind you I'm VERY bad for having to go to the bathroom.Last night I lay wide awake in bed thinking about the movie. I tried to sleep but I couldn't. The movie was very powerful, it made me think about it. I was thinking about it on the way home from the IMAX. My friend and I were talking about it the whole way (and ruining it for people on the bus lol). It goes to show you how powerful a movie can be. It leaves you thinking, and I'm STILL thinking about it as I type this. I am really glad I saw it.As over the top as I may sound, I am not trying to sound over the top. I really loved it. WAY more than the Dark Knight. I'm seeing it again on Wednesday, and I cannot wait. This movie is the best movie I've seen this year and maybe the best I've seen in general (I do not make that up, and have seen several movies in a lifetime alone).",5,My new favorite movie.

1305390,A2L7WYA5OENV03,B002ZG980U,Reticuli,"[12, 44]","I will not criticize the score.  I will not criticize the casting, acting, or efforts of the crew.  Inception's concept has merit and potential.  It has the makings of greatness, especially in its final scene.This is the first Chris Nolan film I can say that's disappointed me.  And this is coming from someone who's studied the nonlinear cut-strategy of Memento while in film school, down to the diagram level.  That was my idea, not thrust upon me by a professor.  Though my hesitations did start some with the trailers' not-so-subtle homages (read that as: total rip off) of certain scenes from Dark City, I really did give it the benefit of the doubt going in... hoping for the best.  Yes, the trailers thrilled me in spite of my feelings that the ""highest form of flattery"" was using a euphemism in this case.  I wouldn't fault anyone for doubting my sincerity after admitting that, but I was excited for this film even with the aspects of the trailers I found disturbing in their derivativeness.  Come on, this was clearly an attempt to recapture the themes and visual motifs of the late 90s that were a seeming artistic lineage dead-end as an unintended consequence of the cognitive interruption that was 9/11 and 8 years of Bush The Decider.  If it was me in Nolan's place, I would likely have borrowed from GATTACA and The Matrix, too, though hopefully with more finesse.So I was thrilled at the prospects of a return to that era of transcendence and artistic progress that was then; a return out of the dark ages of the last decade.  There has undoubtedly been some stagnation during this time and I've been feeling lately that we, in the Western World, are beginning to pick up where we left off: the re-immergence of electronic music as a major  movement, the recessing of jingoistic country music and pop ideals, from passiveness to active engagement, and a social & philosophical inquiry that delves deeper into the nature of consciousness and the human experience far beyond the transient, topical issues of the day, into something with immortality to the art.And in my opinion this film unfortunately fails at that.  Perhaps it's a problem of pacing throughout.  The forced contrivances of the first act trying too hard, too quickly.  Maybe the use of a rather unethical corporate espionage plotline against someone for which we've developed no animosity for.  Then there's the possibly unavoidable here but nonetheless detrimental Deus Ex Machina of seemingly last-minute expounding upon the rules with more jargon and redefining convolutions of them to further both the plot and suspense.  There is an undoubtedly manufactured, written, unnatural quality to the film's twists, reveals, and arc that remind me of the singular clumsiness in The Prestige when we found out the diary was a ploy.  But that was one instant of the seams showing, and briefly passed.  Here, though from an audio/visual standpoint there are no overt seams, they are painfully apparent in other ways: emotional and structural.  It lacks parsimony and elegance, but not due to length.Could it be helped with not only a slightly improved cut, but a different structure or tone from many, even small, changes throughout?  It has certainly happened before, as with Blade Runner.  Is the footage available for it to be improved?  Can the pacing, call-backs, reveals, and dissemination of Inception's rules be made as organic and natural as these convincing somnambulant universes the film's characters inhabit?  Or is the film a mirror of, and as deconstruction-inducing as, the moment those sleeping realize they are in a constructed maze, meant to misdirect and manipulate their intellect and emotions?  Is the nature of this concept too disruptive to the film form?  I don't know.  I have a nagging hunch the film may have been too reliant on its aforementioned influences and lacked sufficient inspiration of its own.  But I can't help believe there's a chance it can be reshaped again, as good as any totally original concept.

No. He directed said films to gain experience for an idea which had been simmering in his mind for almost a decade:Inception, which was to be his breakthrough as a major feature film director. Though not as highly successful overall as The Dark Knight, which mainly received such favorable reviews because of Heath Ledger's posthumous Academy Award, Inception was a success in its own way: subtly brilliant, with a plot simple enough to comprehend but twisting enough to keep your attention.The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is fantastic. Though perhaps not his best composition work, it definitely earns him a place among his greats. Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing actor as always. Ken Watanabe fully captures the corporate businessman's enigmatic role. Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, and Michael Caine are each persuasive in their own way, making the characters believable as well as drawing the appropriate emotion out of you.The plot is an obvious Nolan brainchild. Who else would compile such a brilliant and stunning script and successfully tie it together for one brilliant finale? Not many.Watch this movie. Find the time: it will be worth your while.

But what humans know of as reality is our state of consciousness. And our conscience is not merely a recording of the matter and energy we can perceive.  Our conscious can make things up.  And made up stuff is part of our reality.  What is real?  Is it just what we can perceive or does it include what we create, what we dream?  Is consciousness always a dream, even when we are awake?

How many explosions and bombings and crashes and shoot-outs and falling buildings will it take before the great American audience becomes punch-drunk and insensate to all of this carnage?  Maybe - scary thought - it already has.  I hope I am only dreaming that it has! Will I ever awake to a nightmare world where the word 'subtle' no longer has any meaning?????  Have I already awoken to that sensation-satiated world???Okay, dreams.  Watch ""Perchance to Dream"" - an episode of the original TV series ""Twilight Zone"" - and in less than half an hour you will see everything that is in this 2 hour and 45 minute billion buck bomb (production cost and the eventual rake-in and potential sequel)....and you will see it related poetically, imaginatively, creatively.  INCEPTION is a mad jumble not knowing what the heck it really wants to be: at times it seems like a James Bond movie with Bond wired-up to record his REM state. It also is very similar to ""Shutter Island"" (and Leonardo's performance in this film is just a continuation of his work in that other open-ended, non-ending, what's real/what isn't study in tedium.)  I was also reminded of the old TV series ""Mission Impossible"" every time the one INCEPTION character turned into Tom Berenger....reminded me of Martin Landau's ability in that old TV series to look like anybody on the planet.  The never-ending free-fall fights in the motel hallways that went on and on and on and zzzzzz....oh, sorry, where was I?  Oh, yes, those fights had me thinking the hero was Spiderman without the mask and costume - and then we come back to James Bond.  The winter assault on the mountain fortress had me wishing I were watching ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" instead - the only outing (sadly so)for George Lazenby as Bond, but a good movie - and it climaxed with a commando raid on the villain Blowfeld's snow capped mountain that was extremely similar to the snowy shoot-outs and blow-ups in this pile of film.  And I never was so lulled into a state of near coma as I was during the constant cut-backs to the slow-mo falling of the van into the water and the shots of the sleeping occupants inside with their listless arms floating about like Dr. Floyd's while he slept en route to the moon in zero gravity in a true cinematic masterpiece - ""2001:  A Space Odyssey.""The idea of dreams within dreams goes back to forever...and the ""inception"" for this film may well be a line from Edgar Allan Poe's poem ""A Dream Within a Dream"": ""Is ALL that we see or seem...but a dream within a dream?""  As a matter-of-fact, the second stanza begins: ""I stand amid the roar of a surf-tormented shore..."" which also reminds me of the beginning of this film, with our hero face down on a shore with the waves rolling in.  The poem itself was written in 1849.Anyway, it is curious that this extremely over-done action packed, overblown musically scored, veritably one-note acted film dealing with Dreams....almost had me falling into one of my own, right there in the theatre!

Not only one of the most acclaimed and successful films of 2010, Inception is also one of the most original and well structured thrillers to hit the big screen in years. The movie is one of those rare big-budgeted summer Hollywood productions that not only delivers stunning special effects and great action but an engrossing storyline and notable performances. The cast also includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, Ken Watanabe and Michael Caine.If you're planning to add Inception to your Blu-Ray collection, it will surely standout among your other titles. The acclaimed Sci-Fi thriller is presented in 2.4:1 widescreen format. The Blu-Ray boasts with an excellent picture and audio presentation. The picture transfer comes out almost perfect with rich colors and striking contrast. The DTS-HD Master Audio ranks as one of the engaging audio tracks of any 2010 Blu-Ray releases. Among its most interesting special feature is the Extraction Mode with Christopher Nolan, cast and crew whom provide great behind-the-scenes information. Other supplemental material include theatrical trailers, TV spots, promotional and picture galleries, and two behind-the-scenes featurettes (Dreams: Cinema of the Subconscious & Inception: The Cobol Job).

1305402,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B002ZG980U,RJ Smoove,"[2, 3]","This is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. The Dark Knight is still my all-time favorite film, and I think that it is better, but this is HIS masterpiece. He managed to create his own personal intellectual property, not based on any previous work. Since Batman has thousands of comics to build a great film around, it took a lot less to bring The Dark Knight to life, than it did to create Inception. He easily outdid himself with this one. Everyone is going to talk about how smart the movie is. How it requires your full attention, and so on. I'm not going to beat a dead horse. Yes, the movie is brilliant. Yes, you do have to use your brain to enjoy it. There's not a hundred explosions and acrobatic stunts to keep today's action fans excited, but fans of every genre should find something here. The concept of entering another persons mind is such a brilliant thing to work with. The only other movie I can remember like that was The Cell. That film has absolutely nothing on this one. Ten years in the making, this is a movie that everyone and their grandmother should go to the theatre, pay whatever for the tickets, and let your minds get blown. I hate to be a fanboy, but it's so hard not to fall in love with a film that obviously, the creators took their sweet time with. The attention to detail is something of beauty. We don't get enough art in our modern films. Most blockbusters are dumb fun, and not much more. Chris Nolan consistently breaks that stigma, and defies what we've come to expect from Summer blockbusters. He always knows how to cast his films perfectly too.The acting is great, in my opinion. Not everyone was perfect, but everyone was very believable. Leo DiCaprio is creeping his way into my favorite actors list. He is today's 1970s Robert De Niro. Ellen Page is always great, and she's no different here. Joseph Gordon-Levitt...seriously. Does anyone not like him? No offense, but if you don't like Joseph Gordon-Levitt something is wrong with you. He's not an up and comer anymore. He's officially a big deal. Get used to that face, and get ready to up his paycheck Hollywood. Michael Caine is one of my favorites, so I'm not going to linger on him. I love everything he does. Tom Hardy is great as well. I only knew him from RocknRolla, but he was great there too. Ken Watanabe is still Ras Al Ghul in my eyes. I hope he keeps working with Nolan. I can go on and on about the performances. They were just all so great. Since I'm starting to sound like a broken record, talking about the ""great performances"", I'll just mention the last few actors, and it's understood that they were fantastic. Okay, so Cillain Murphy, Tom Berenger, Dileep Rao, and of course the beautiful Marion Cotillard...all made an impression. There so many facets to this film. The score, by Nolan favorite Hans Zimmer, was phenomenal. I love his music very much. The score is still playing in my head right now. The screenplay was unique, yet still felt very much like a Christopher Nolan story. His movies all feel almost exactly the same. His style is so predictable, yet it never gets old. I loved this movie, and . No matter how great the film is, the best part about it finally being out is that The Dark Knight Rises is right around the corner.",5,"""Your Mind is the Scene of the Crime.""",1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,3259,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'masterpiece', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'still', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'film', 'think', 'better', 'HIS', 'masterpiece', 'managed', 'create', 'own', 'personal', 'intellectual', 'property', 'not', 'based', 'previous', 'work', 'Batman', 'thousands', 'comics', 'build', 'great', 'film', 'around', 'took', 'lot', 'less', 'bring', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'life', 'did', 'create', 'Inception', 'easily', 'outdid', 'one', 'Everyone', 'going', 'talk', 'how', 'smart', 'movie', 'How', 'full', 'attention', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'beat', 'dead', 'horse', 'Yes', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'Yes', 'do', 'have', 'use', 'brain', 'enjoy', 'not', 'hundred', 'explosions', 'acrobatic', 'stunts', 'keep', 'today', 'action', 'fans', 'excited', 'fans', 'genre', 'should', 'find', 'something', 'here', 'concept', 'entering', 'persons', 'mind', 'such', 'brilliant', 'thing', 'work', 'only', 'other', 'movie', 'can', 'remember', 'was', 'Cell', 'film', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'one', 'Ten', 'years', 'making', 'movie', 'everyone', 'grandmother', 'should', 'go', 'theatre', 'pay', 'tickets', 'let', 'minds', 'get', 'blown', 'hate', 'be', 'fanboy', 'so', 'hard', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'film', 'obviously', 'creators', 'took', 'sweet', 'time', 'attention', 'detail', 'something', 'beauty', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'art', 'modern', 'films', 'Most', 'blockbusters', 'are', 'dumb', 'fun', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'consistently', 'stigma', 'defies', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Summer', 'blockbusters', 'always', 'how', 'cast', 'films', 'perfectly', 'acting', 'great', 'opinion', 'Not', 'everyone', 'was', 'perfect', 'everyone', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'Leo', 'DiCaprio', 'creeping', 'way', 'favorite', 'actors', 'list', 'today', '1970s', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'always', 'great', 'different', 'here', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'seriously', 'Does', 'anyone', 'not', 'offense', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'something', 'wrong', 'not', 'up', 'comer', 'anymore', 'officially', 'big', 'deal', 'Get', 'used', 'face', 'get', 'ready', 'up', 'paycheck', 'Hollywood', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'one', 'favorites', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'linger', 'love', 'everything', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'knew', 'RocknRolla', 'was', 'great', 'there', 'too', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'still', 'Ras', 'Al', 'Ghul', 'eyes', 'hope', 'working', 'Nolan', 'can', 'go', 'performances', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'great', ""'m"", 'starting', 'sound', 'broken', 'record', 'talking', 'great', 'performances', ""'ll"", 'just', 'mention', 'last', 'few', 'actors', 'understood', 'were', 'fantastic', 'Okay', 'so', 'Cillain', 'Murphy', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Dileep', 'Rao', 'course', 'beautiful', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'all', 'made', 'impression', 'so', 'many', 'facets', 'film', 'score', 'Nolan', 'favorite', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'love', 'music', 'very', 'much', 'score', 'still', 'playing', 'head', 'right', 'now', 'screenplay', 'was', 'unique', 'yet', 'still', 'felt', 'very', 'much', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'story', 'movies', 'feel', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'style', 'so', 'predictable', 'never', 'old', 'loved', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'film', 'best', 'part', 'finally', 'being', 'out', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'right', 'corner']",N/A

1305405,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002ZG980U,RMurray847,"[2, 3]","One of the most lauded films of the summer of 2010, INCEPTION is a big, bold, fascinating, gorgeous film that puts the brains of the audience to work.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really stir the heart very much.  But you'll be hard-pressed to find a more technically assured movie.  Or a movie with such an attractively diverse cast.  It's a film that isn't afraid to be rich, even dense, with plot.  It has creativity coming out of its pores.  It is pretty engrossing throughout (though I'd say it is about 10-15 minutes too long due to a few moments of slack pace).  It just didn't grab me emotionally...and it's amazing how important that is, because even though it had all the things going for it that I mention above...it didn't truly EXCITE me.In case you haven't heard, INCEPTION envisions a world in which the idea of entering the dreams of others is a reality, and in fact, is a small, lucrative industry.  In this industry, trained extractors and their teams are able to enter the dreams of their subjects to extract secrets.  It's industrial espionage to the highest degree.  It's tricky work, because it's easy to alert the dreamer to ones presence.  But for master extractor Leonardo DiCaprio, it's all in a day's work.  Along with his partner Joseph Gordon Levitt, he's the best at what he does.  Which is why he is hired by Japanese industrialist Ken Watanabe to enter the dreams of the son of a rival industrialist (Cillian Murphy) in order to plant an idea into his mind.  This is the theoretically possible, but certainly highly dangerous, concept of Inception.  Planting an idea is difficult, and the results are not always predictable...as DiCaprio knows all too well.  He had a bad outcome involving inception and his wife (Marion Cotillard)...a mistake that continues literally to haunt him and which is increasingly affecting his dream-roaming abilities.  His team knows he's the best...but they also see that he is liable to put them into great jeopardy.Because the idea of inception is so complex and involves delving into a dream within a dream within a dream; writer/director Christopher Nolan is obliged to provide us with a lot of back-story & exposition about the conundrums of wandering into and influencing the dreams of others.  To ease his efforts, he introduces a new member to DiCaprio's team, an architect who must construct the dreamworlds they will implant in Murphy.  This architect (Ellen Page) is new to all this, and so much of the early portions of the film involve DiCaprio explaining ""how this all works"" to Page.  It's all needed in order for the viewer to follow what comes later...but these scenes have artificiality about them.Once the inception begins, INCEPTION becomes a tightly wound thriller.  It's sci-fi, true...but the science-fiction is really just trappings for a good, old-fashioned cat-and-mouse movie.  To be honest, I can imagine Alfred Hitchcock tackling this subject matter.  Thrillers wrapped around psychological drama.  Just as James Stewart becomes undone by the memories of his wife and the appearance of her lookalike...so DiCaprio unravels at the memories and dream-appearances of his wife.Nolan likes to construct movies that are puzzles.  MEMENTO was somewhat like putting together a Rubik's cube...nearly impossible.  It was pure puzzle, with real efforts at character and emotional heft pushed way into the background.  THE PRESTIGE was like the biggest budgeted episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE ever...with the tricks of stage magicians melding with true magic in a story full of twists.  Neither of these films really pretended to have any deeper meaning...they were meant as entertainment for audiences who didn't mind being very attentive to detail and having their minds stretched.  This made them exciting.  INCEPTION has many of the same flavors, but wants very much to be about something more.  It wants to be about the power of dreams and entering dreams.  It explores the damage the process can cause.  However, we all know that we can't really jump into the dreams of others...so all the deep psychological territory Nolan explores has no bearing on what we experience in the real world.  It only illuminates the psychological condition of man in a world in which entering dreams is possible.DiCaprio is clearly the main character and the nominal hero of the film...and he's an actor I have often admired, even as others have criticized him.  And he has excellent chemistry with the volatile Cotillard.  But much of his mental state feels like a concept and not fully integrated into a believable character.  His anguish often feels generic.  His anger feels generic.  His intensity, for the first time, feels like ""oh, here is DiCaprio doing his thing again.""  Fortunately, the film is packed full of other truly exceptional performances.  Cotillard is truly emerging as a force to be reckoned with.  Ellen Page, even in a thankless role, is never less than compelling:  she's clearly a fiercely intelligent person and it's so nice to see this intelligence allowed to flourish on screen.  The delightful Tom Hardy, as a team member, steals most scenes he's in through simple charisma.  Dileep Rao makes an excellent scientist.  Murphy, though sometimes a bit wooden, does a good job overall.  Gordon Levitt provides a convincing stolidity as DiCaprio's long-time extraction partner.  He's a dream-walking professional who isn't tormented by personal demons.  It's the first role I've seen him in that totally discards the ""kid actor growing into a young man actor"" vibe he's had for awhile now.  He is now an adult actor, who simply once was also a child star.  Tom Berenger & Pete Postlewaite are welcome in small roles...and Nolan favorite Michael Caine shows up in a two-scene role that makes us wish he was in 10 times as many scenes.  It's hardly a new observation for me to make, but Caine is truly a giant of the screen.  Does the man even know how to be anything less than the most interesting person on screen when he's in a scene?Technically, the film is a wonder.  The dreamscapes that are envisioned are marvelous, and even though they are certainly heavily reliant on CGI...the CGI is top-notch and convincing.  Watching Paris fold in on itself is something worth seeing in the theaters.  The musical score is often intrusive...but it is meant to be.  The score truly helps build the sense of dread that Nolan is going for.  And best of all is a series of scenes involving Gordon Levitt fighting some ""bad guys"" while the hotel hallway he is in keeps spinning around.  It feels a little like something we might have seen in a MATRIX movie...only executed about 10 times more convincingly.  Later, Gordon Levitt has to move all his companions (who are busy dreaming) into an elevator.  The method he uses to complete this, while gravity has lost its grip on HIS world, is quietly fascinating.  Simply put, the film is endlessly inventive when it comes to visuals.I highly recommend INCEPTION.  It is intellectually stimulating and is frequently quite exciting.  Most of the performances are top-notch.  (And frankly, I don't think the puzzle is all that difficult to keep up with...don't believe critics who say you have to see it twice to figure out what's going on.)  It just doesn't quite grab you in the heart.  I was always interested, always engaged, but never swept away.",4,A treat for the mind and the eye...not so much for the heart,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,7374,"['One', 'most', 'lauded', 'films',

1305408,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002ZG980U,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Inception (Christopher Nolan, 2010)Ever since Memento hit the streets ten years ago (we'll not discuss Following, his boring first film, except to note in passing it's getting a theatrical re-release either later this year or next year), Christopher Nolan has been delivering popcorn films that have pretensions at real depth. Pretensions, yes, because while they're usually clever, looking closer reveals that there's not really much to be seen. And there's a small part of me that feels I should be castigating Nolan for this, in the same way I despise the Wachowski Brothers for the same sort of ""it looks deep, but it's really not"" they pulled in the Matrix movies. The difference is that, most of the time, Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker orders of magnitude better than the Wachowski Brothers, and his popcorn tastes a whole lot better. (Both of the exceptions, the aforementioned Following and the awful, awful 2002 remake of Insomnia, suffer from not pulling off the illusion of depth, rather than suffering from bad filmmaking.) Inception, both written and directed by Nolan (though I swear I heard somewhere a while ago that this is loosely based on a Philip K. Dick story; I just can't remember where I heard it, or which one), is the latest manifestation of this trend.Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio, taking a break from his longtime association with Martin Scorsese) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are extractors, guys who can slip into your subconscious and, essentially, spy on your thoughts. Obviously, this has a great deal of use in the industrial espionage arena, and as we open, they're trying to get the plans for a business expansion out of Saito (Ken Watanabe, who previously worked with Nolan on Batman Begins), an industrial magnate. After Arthur, who engineered the dream scenario (more on that later), screws up a small detail, Watanabe realizes that the dream is a dream, and the whole team is in jeopardy. It doesn't help that Mal (Marion Cotillard, recently of Nine), a projection of Cobb's, shows up to throw a monkeywrench into the works at the worst possible time. After they're back in the real world, however, Saito does the one thing most captains of industry don't think to do in real life--he's impressed enough to hire them. He tasks them with inception, the impossible (by conventional wisdom) task of planting a memory in someone's mind rather than extracting one. His offer: charges that prevent Cobb from returning to the United States will be wiped clean, and he will be able to return to the children he hasn't seen in years. Thus, Cobb and Arthur start putting together a team. First, they hire an architect, Ariadne (Juno's Ellen Page), to design the dreamscape. A fellow extractor who also happens to be a mercenary, Eames (RocknRolla's Tom Hardy). And a chemist, Yusuf (Avatar's Dileep Rao), who can make the compounds that will both keep the subject, Robert Fischer (28 Days Later...'s Cillian Murphy), asleep and stimulate his dreams. It's Eames who hits on the perfect avenue for inception: make Fischer himself believe he's a part of the team and that they're trying to get secrets from Fischer's father's right-hand man, Browning (Tom Berenger, who has been gone for far too long from blockbusters). And at the last minute, Saito insists on coming along as well...First off, how is it that I've been hearing about this movie for an entire year, I've seen trailers for it at least once a week for the past six months, and I had no idea that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one of the best actors of his generation, was in it? Way to drop the ball, publicity department. For that matter, most people seem to have only heard ""DiCaprio"", ""Page"", and ""Nolan"", which seems an insult to the incredible cast assembled here, which also includes Pete Postlethwaite, Michael Caine, Lukas Haas, and a handful of other folks you'll recognize. But all is forgiven once butt is actually in seat and things start blowing up, because while, as I said before, Inception isn't nearly as deep a film as it wants to believe it is (or wants us to believe it is), it is an incredibly entertaining one. Upon reflection, I think the reason for this is that Nolan is just as good with a troop of A-listers as he was with a troop of B-listers in Memento; just as he got career-best performances out of folks like Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Guy Pearce, he whips a bunch of folks here into top form. This is (by far) Page's best performance since Hard Candy five years ago. DiCaprio and Levitt are always good, and DiCaprio has been turning in some monster performances since he finally shook off whatever slump he was in from 1997 through 2006, but this one ranks up there with What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and The Basketball Diaries. Murphy hasn't been this good since 28 Days Later.... Etc. And Nolan, of course, is a very, very good action director; there's CGI here, but it's used judiciously, and that alone in comparison to so many recent action films makes this stuff look real almost by default. Which is pretty impressive when one of your scenes involves folding Paris over like an omelet.I'm going to close out with much the same thing I said about Nolan's last film. As I write this, Inception is sitting on the IMDB Top 250 chart at #3, with a 9.1 rating. (Actually, all the top three films have a 9.1 rating; the others are The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. Which means it's actually tried for #1.) I think that's overstating the case, just as I thought the case was overstated with The Dark Knight (which, two years after its release, has slipped to #12, with an 8.8 rating), but not terribly much. There's no denying that Nolan is one of the best directors working today when he brings his A game, and he's arguably the best working today within the Hollywood system; anyone else I'd apply that moniker to is either working completely outside it (Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Shinya Tsukamoto, and Bela Tarr are obvious examples, though Julian Schnabel would also qualify) or make great films outside the Hollywood system and crappy films in it (Guillermo del Toro is a stunning example of this). Nolan knows how to game the system, and he's also clever enough to take a pretty basic idea and make it seem like it's a world-changing philosophy. It won't hold water when you start talking about it with your friends after you leave the theater, but does it matter? By that time, you will have been thoroughly entertained by some fantastic actors and a fantastic director, and isn't that what going to the movies is all about? *** ",4,"Fun, but not nearly as deep as

I'll go through this piecemeal to make sure I hit on all the things that go into building a good movie and why this hits so consistently.The acting is nearly flawless.  I am going to compare this movie to the other really good Leonardo DiCaprio movie out this year ""Shutter Island"".  Like ""Inception"", ""Island"" introduces several good actors in a clean sequence, helping to establish each their part in the overall narrative, each person plays their role with great line delivery, emotive strength, and with motivations that while not clear at the beginning, are revealed as the story progresses to give clarity and meaning to the whole of the performance.  However, I felt a deeper connection to Leo's performance in ""Shutter Island"", I don't know how, but I think that his performance was stronger there than here, but it is really the difference in temperature between a cup of coffee and a cup of coffee poured from the same pot 12 seconds latter.  If you have seen both movies you will be able to understand why the comparison between the two parts is so easy.  So I say near flawless because that is what it is, near flawless for the lead.The action is stellar, with subjective gravity, malleable environments, legions of soldiers battling in unique structures toward powerful ultimate goals.  If I would say one thing, at times one action sequence by Joseph Gordon Levitt completely overshadows the others so completely that it seems embarrassing, sure one guy turns into a combination of Little Nemo and James Bond, but Levitt turns into a combination of Neo and Eliot Ness, it is really good.  Also: not a lot of CGI, so the images on screen look real because they were filmed on real sets using wire movements and turning sets.The sci-fi concepts are introduced wholesale at the beginning of the movie in a way that makes you say something a long the line of ""What's up with that?"" and ""What is going on there?""  Each part of the original illustration is then explained via the natural course of the movies narrative.  As a new character is introduced they display why they are important and in doing so explain what was present in the opening sequence.  All of this exposition is never done to the point of needless background, I don't care how the dream machine was invented, by who, or where, all I need to know is what it is and what it does, boom and boom both are explained clean, neat and concise.  It is smart and well paced in this way, using its strong visuals to make the world and dialogue become just to the left of real.  In other words: while they could use the dreamworld as an excuse to travel to different periods of history, fight monsters, and gain super powers, the movie keeps you grounded in military complexes and hotels that adequately uses the dream environment to create surreal action and adventure within a world real enough that the audience doesn't get turned off.Ambiguous in message and ending.  Watch the movie, the theme is a mind breaker, as is the chief conflict of the film, as is the major resolution.Strong and solid film throughout.  There is no major flaw that detracts from this movie.  There is no miscast person, no missed beat of action, no unnecessary conflict.  And while I have heard that some people are confused, I felt zero confusion, some people didn't get the message, I got the message entirely.  This is a superb movie that you need to go see.",5,"Spoiler Free ""Inception"" Review",1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,3643,"['Okay', 'Inception', 'not', 'Nolan', 'best', 'movie', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'still', 'might', 'be', 'being', 'very', 'partial', 'subject', 'matter', 'still', '5', 'star', 'cap', 'like', 'hand', 'out', 'films', 'blow', 'mind', 'open', ""'ll"", 'go', 'piecemeal', 'make', 'sure', 'hit', 'things', 'go', 'building', 'good', 'movie', 'why', 'so', 'consistently.The', 'acting', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'am', 'going', 'compare', 'movie', 'other', 'really', 'good', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'movie', 'year', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'Inception', 'Island', 'several', 'good', 'actors', 'clean', 'sequence', 'helping', 'establish', 'part', 'overall', 'narrative', 'person', 'role', 'great', 'line', 'delivery', 'emotive', 'strength', 'motivations', 'not', 'clear', 'beginning', 'are', 'revealed', 'story', 'give', 'clarity', 'meaning', 'whole', 'performance', 'However', 'felt', 'deeper', 'connection', 'Leo', 'performance', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'think', 'performance', 'was', 'stronger', 'there', 'here', 'really', 'difference', 'temperature', 'cup', 'coffee', 'cup', 'coffee', 'poured', 'same', 'pot', '12', 'seconds', 'latter', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'why', 'comparison', 'two', 'parts', 'so', 'easy', 'say', 'flawless', 'what', 'near', 'flawless', 'lead.The', 'action', 'stellar', 'subjective', 'gravity', 'malleable', 'environments', 'legions', 'soldiers', 'battling', 'unique', 'structures', 'powerful', 'ultimate', 'goals', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'times', 'one', 'action', 'sequence', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'completely', 'others', 'so', 'completely', 'embarrassing', 'sure', 'one', 'guy', 'combination', 'Little', 'Nemo', 'James', 'Bond', 'Levitt', 'combination', 'Neo', 'Eliot', 'Ness', 'really', 'good', 'Also', 'not', 'lot', 'CGI', 'images', 'screen', 'look', 'real', 'were', 'filmed', 'real', 'sets', 'using', 'wire', 'movements', 'turning', 'sets.The', 'sci-fi', 'concepts', 'are', 'introduced', 'wholesale', 'beginning', 'movie', 'way', 'say', 'something', 'long', 'line', 'What', 'up', 'What', 'going', 'part', 'original', 'illustration', 'then', 'explained', 'natural', 'course', 'movies', 'narrative', 'new', 'character', 'introduced', 'display', 'why', 'are', 'important', 'doing', 'so', 'explain', 'what', 'was', 'present', 'opening', 'sequence', 'exposition', 'never', 'done', 'point', 'needless', 'background', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'dream', 'machine', 'was', 'invented', 'who', 'where', 'need', 'know', 'what', 'what', 'boom', 'boom', 'are', 'explained', 'clean', 'neat', 'concise', 'smart', 'well', 'paced', 'way', 'using', 'strong', 'visuals', 'make', 'world', 'dialogue', 'become', 'just', 'left', 'real', 'other', 'words', 'could', 'use', 'dreamworld', 'excuse', 'travel', 'different', 'periods', 'history', 'fight', 'monsters', 'gain', 'super', 'powers', 'movie', 'grounded', 'military', 'complexes', 'hotels', 'adequately', 'dream', 'environment', 'create', 'surreal', 'action', 'adventure', 'world', 'real', 'enough', 'audience', ""n't"", 'get', 'turned', 'off.Ambiguous', 'message', 'ending', 'Watch', 'movie', 'theme', 'mind', 'breaker', 'chief', 'conflict', 'film', 'major', 'resolution.Strong', 'solid', 'film', 'major', 'flaw', 'movie', 'miscast', 'person', 'missed', 'beat', 'action', 'unnecessary', 'conflict', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'are', 'confused', 'felt', 'zero', 'confusion', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'message', 'got', 'message', 'entirely', 'superb', 'movie', 'need', 'go', 'see']",N/A

The people who say they fell asleep watching this film are the same ones who probably rushed out to see 'Prince of Persia' when it came out.  If you're not the kind of person who actually likes to think while they watch a movie, then no, this film isn't for you.  You will have to think.  I think it's extraordinary what Chris Nolan did with this film.  The idea of being able be inside of a dream, going deeper and deeper into the dream--essentially, a dream within a dream--is something I find absolutely fascinating.I love to see films that look like the writer/director put a little thought into what they were doing before they did it.  Many people just like to watch a movie and have the plot and everything else be self-explanatory.  They like to just be ""entertained.""  My idea of entertainment isn't mindless action sequences, drawn-out gunfights and unnecessary sex scenes.

The whole concept was totally inane and not at all good Sci-Fi. The theme had potential. Had it depicted an experiment in mind control through manipulation of dreams etc it could have been more believable and entertaining. But the film goes way beyond this and suggests that the dreams somehow become real and that some virtual action in a dream can somehow bring about real action elsewhere. And it invokes multiple depths: 'virtual to virtual to real' etc. Don't worry if you think it is more complex than you can understand. It wasn't. It was stupid.The filming was annoying also. The action parts were excessively noisy and the dialogue parts excessively quiet. What's happened to the actor training programs? Why can't the performers speak up and enunciate their words so that we can understand what they're talking about?  Rent an old Bogart or Gary Grant or even a James Bond movie and you'll see what I mean.In this movie you have to turn the volume down during the action sequences and turn it way up in the talking sequences.Bottom line: The movie was a total dead loss.,2,Silly,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,1144,"['give', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'visual', 'effects', 'rest', 'zero', 'whole', 'concept', 'was', 'totally', 'inane', 'not', 'good', 'Sci-Fi', 'theme', 'had', 'potential', 'Had', 'depicted', 'experiment', 'mind', 'control', 'manipulation', 'dreams', 'etc', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'entertaining', 'film', 'way', 'dreams', 'somehow', 'become', 'real', 'virtual', 'action', 'dream', 'can', 'somehow', 'bring', 'about', 'real', 'action', 'elsewhere', 'multiple', 'depths', ""'virtual"", 'virtual', 'real', 'etc', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'think', 'more', 'complex', 'can', 'understand', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'stupid.The', 'filming', 'was', 'annoying', 'also', 'action', 'parts', 'were', 'excessively', 'noisy', 'dialogue', 'parts', 'excessively', 'quiet', 'What', 'happened', 'actor', 'training', 'programs', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'performers', 'speak', 'up', 'enunciate', 'words', 'can', 'understand', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Rent', 'old', 'Bogart', 'Gary', 'Grant', 'even', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean.In', 'movie', 'have', 'turn', 'volume', 'down', 'action', 'sequences', 'turn', 'way', 'up', 'talking', 'sequences.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'was', 'total', 'dead', 'loss']",N/A
1305418,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002ZG980U,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 3]","Finally, a mega-budget Hollywood blockbuster worth raving about!Christopher Nolan, the genius behind the last two ""Batman"" movies, hits new heights of creativity and imagination with ""Inception,"" a sci-fi masterpiece about a technology that allows people to enter into the dreams of others with the express purpose of planting ideas into their subconscious. The concept is dealt with on such a complex level that, for a large portion of the movie, the characters are floating around in a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream. Yet, so intelligent is the writing and so meticulously thought-out the premise that the audience almost never gets confused about what's happening and, thus, can just sit back, relax and go along for the ride.And what a ride it turns out to be! Without getting too deep into the nuts-and-bolts aspects of the plotting itself, suffice it to say that the story involves a group of ""dream manipulation experts"" - Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Ellen Page, among others - who employ the technology known as Inception to enter into the pre-programmed dream of a young man (Cilliam Murphy) whose ailing father owns a giant energy firm. Their goal is to convince the son to break up the company after the old man (the late Pete Postlethwaite in one of his final performances) dies, so that a wealthy competitor (Ken Watanabe) will be able to pick up the pieces for himself. It's a tribute to Nolan's astuteness as a storyteller that he gives us this rather mundane overarching plot device rather than having the mission be about convincing someone to blow up half the civilized world or something equally over-the-top. This simpler motivation keeps the movie from sliding over into cautionary-tale territory - where most serious sci-fi works seem to eventually wind up - and allows us to concentrate more fully on the content and style of the dreams themselves.Another triumph for the genre is that the movie gives us a central character who's actually worth caring about. DiCaprio, the head of the team that goes into the dream, is a generally reformed ""corporate espionage thief"" who lost his wife (Marion Cotillard) as a result of a dream-traveling scenario gone awry and who has been wracked with grief and guilt over the incident ever since. As if that weren't bad enough, he's been forbidden to return to the United States, where his two small children reside, because the authorities mistakenly believe he was responsible for her death. It is only when Watanabe promises to get the murder charges dropped if DiCaprio does this one last job for him that he agrees to take on the mission. As embodied by DiCaprio, who, by the way, has never been better, Dom Cobb becomes the heart and soul of a movie that, given the genre's track record in that regard, could easily have had neither a heart nor a soul. Instead, Nolan and DiCaprio draw us into the picture with an emotional force rarely found in even the most intimate indie drama, let alone an effects-laden super-spectacular such as this one.And spectacular is certainly the word for the cornucopia of visual delights the movie offers up to its audience, as a team of FX wizards creates dream worlds of eye-popping complexity and design.Like even the best of films, ""Inception"" is not without its flaws. I could certainly have done without some of those skiing scenes near the end, and I'm sure there are enough holes in the plotline to keep perfection-seekers nitpicking and carping for years to come. However, I also imagine that ""Inception"" will be dissected and studied over by film students and film lovers alike in endless fashion, and that their efforts will lead to the discovery of themes, motifs, symbols etc., that are not readily apparent on a single viewing, when we're just dazzled by all the brilliance and ingenuity that's gone into the work.That's all the more reason for movie watchers to return to this cinematic treat regularly and often.",5,the re-vitalization of a genre,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,3948,"['Finally', 'mega-budget', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'worth', 'raving', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'genius', 'last', 'two', 'Batman', 'movies', 'new', 'heights', 'creativity', 'imagination', 'Inception', 'sci-fi', 'masterpiece', 'technology', 'people', 'enter', 'dreams', 'others', 'express', 'purpose', 'planting', 'ideas', 'subconscious', 'concept', 'dealt', 'such', 'complex', 'level', 'large', 'portion', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'floating', 'around', 'dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream', 'so', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'so', 'meticulously', 'premise', 'audience', 'almost', 'never', 'confused', 'what', 'happening', 'thus', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'go', 'along', 'ride.And', 'what', 'ride', 'out', 'be', 'getting', 'too', 'deep', 'nuts-and-bolts', 'aspects', 'plotting', 'say', 'story', 'group', 'dream', 'manipulation', 'experts', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'others', 'who', 'employ', 'technology', 'known', 'Inception', 'enter', 'pre-programmed', 'dream', 'young', 'man', 'Cilliam', 'Murphy', 'ailing', 'father', 'giant', 'energy', 'firm', 'goal', 'convince', 'son', 'break', 'up', 'company', 'old', 'man', 'late', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'one', 'final', 'performances', 'dies', 'wealthy', 'competitor', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'tribute', 'Nolan', 'astuteness', 'storyteller', 'rather', 'mundane', 'overarching', 'plot', 'device', 'rather', 'having', 'mission', 'be', 'convincing', 'someone', 'blow', 'up', 'civilized', 'world', 'something', 'equally', 'over-the-top', 'simpler', 'motivation', 'movie', 'sliding', 'over', 'cautionary-tale', 'territory', 'where', 'most', 'serious', 'sci-fi', 'works', 'seem', 'eventually', 'wind', 'up', 'concentrate', 'more', 'fully', 'content', 'style', 'dreams', 'themselves.Another', 'triumph', 'genre', 'movie', 'central', 'character', 'who', 'actually', 'worth', 'caring', 'about', 'DiCaprio', 'head', 'team', 'dream', 'generally', 'reformed', 'corporate', 'espionage', 'thief', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'result', 'dream-traveling', 'scenario', 'gone', 'awry', 'who', 'been', 'wracked', 'grief', 'guilt', 'incident', 'ever', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'been', 'forbidden', 'return', 'United', 'States', 'where', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'reside', 'authorities', 'mistakenly', 'believe', 'was', 'responsible', 'death', 'only', 'when', 'Watanabe', 'get', 'murder', 'charges', 'dropped', 'DiCaprio', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'take', 'mission', 'embodied', 'DiCaprio', 'who', 'way', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Dom', 'Cobb', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'given', 'genre', 'track', 'record', 'regard', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'had', 'heart', 'soul', 'Instead', 'Nolan', 'DiCaprio', 'draw', 'picture', 'emotional', 'force', 'rarely', 'found', 'even', 'most', 'intimate', 'indie', 'drama', 'let', 'alone', 'effects-laden', 'super-spectacular', 'such', 'one.And', 'spectacular', 'certainly', 'word', 'cornucopia', 'visual', 'delights', 'movie', 'up', 'audience', 'team', 'FX', 'wizards', 'dream', 'worlds', 'eye-popping', 'complexity', 'design.Like', 'even', 'best', 'films', 'Inception', 'not', 'flaws', 'could', 'certainly', 'have', 'done', 'skiing', 'scenes', 'end', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'enough', 'holes', 'plotline', 'keep', 'perfection-seekers', 'nitpicking', 'carping', 'years', 'come', 'However', 'also', 'imagine', 'Inception', 'will', 'be', 'dissected', 'studied', 'film', 'students', 'film', 'lovers', 'alike', 'endless', 'fashion', 'efforts', 'will', 'lead', 'discovery', 'themes', 'motifs', 'symbols', 'etc.', 'are', 'not', 'readily', 'apparent', 'single', 'viewing', 'when', ""'re"", 'just', 'dazzled', 'brilliance', 'ingenuity', 'gone', 'work.That', 'more', 'reason', 'movie', 'watchers', 'return', 'cinematic', 'treat', 'regularly', 'often']",N/A

But I'm disappointed that such an obviously smart director has so quickly allowed himself to be assimilated into the Hollywood blockbuster mentality. Granted, he does the mega-budget, computer-graphic, eye-candy movie better than most, but he could be doing less expensive & more interesting films. ""Inception"" is just ok (though numbingly familiar) to look at--for about an hour. Then, if you're inclined toward concise, engaging & original films that do a lot within a small space--such as classic noirs or eccentric but really fascinating art films like ""Fallen Angels"" or ""Last Life in the Universe""--this is hard to sit through. It's much longer than it needs to be, and clumsily confusing--despite stopping the narrative every now & then to explain what's happening & whose dream we're in, which tells you there isn't total confidence in the viewer. Or in the movie itself. Finally, I didn't really care whether I was in a dream within a dream within a dream--or just dreaming I was at the movies. Nor did I particularly care about the sentimental idea of getting back to his real-life kids. (Or, hey, do they even exist? Wow!) Being a cinephile of sorts (ok, I dislike the term too), many friends I've talked with who have a similarly broad, extensive experience with film have agreed. (Read David Denby's review in ""The New Yorker,"" which nails the pretensions & problems here.) It's a kids' film, a flashy but cheesy puzzle film, and finally a shaggy spinning-top story. Who cares if the ""reality token"" keeps spinning or topples? I waited this long & then Nolan won't tell me?  Not that it mattered at that point. I was just happy to have done my cultural duty & was free to return to a world that, dream or not, is far more interesting than ""Inception.""",2,"I know, I'm in the minority here, but...",1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1817,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'fan', 'Following', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'obviously', 'smart', 'director', 'so', 'quickly', 'allowed', 'be', 'assimilated', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'mentality', 'Granted', 'mega-budget', 'computer-graphic', 'eye-candy', 'movie', 'better', 'most', 'could', 'be', 'doing', 'less', 'expensive', 'more', 'interesting', 'films', 'Inception', 'just', 'ok', 'numbingly', 'familiar', 'look', 'hour', 'Then', ""'re"", 'inclined', 'concise', 'engaging', 'original', 'films', 'do', 'lot', 'small', 'space', 'such', 'classic', 'noirs', 'eccentric', 'really', 'fascinating', 'art', 'films', 'Fallen', 'Angels', 'Last', 'Life', 'Universe', 'hard', 'sit', 'much', 'longer', 'be', 'clumsily', 'confusing', 'stopping', 'narrative', 'now', 'then', 'explain', 'what', 'happening', 'dream', ""'re"", ""n't"", 'total', 'confidence', 'viewer', 'movie', 'Finally', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'was', 'dream', 'dream', 'dream', 'just', 'dreaming', 'was', 'movies', 'did', 'particularly', 'care', 'sentimental', 'idea', 'getting', 'back', 'real-life', 'kids', 'hey', 'do', 'even', 'exist', 'Wow', 'Being', 'cinephile', 'sorts', 'ok', 'dislike', 'term', 'too', 'many', 'friends', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'who', 'have', 'similarly', 'broad', 'extensive', 'experience', 'film', 'have', 'agreed', 'Read', 'David', 'Denby', 'review', 'New', 'Yorker', 'pretensions', 'problems', 'here', 'kids', 'film', 'flashy', 'cheesy', 'puzzle', 'film', 'finally', 'shaggy', 'spinning-top', 'story', 'Who', 'reality', 'token', 'spinning', 'topples', 'waited', 'long', 'then', 'Nolan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Not', 'mattered', 'point', 'was', 'just', 'happy', 'have', 'done', 'cultural', 'duty', 'was', 'free', 'return', 'world', 'dream', 'not', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'Inception']",N/A

1305430,AIVW1JAT9T44,B002ZG980U,"Rustin Parr ""Rustin Parr""","[3, 5]","Executed in fast-paced, hurrying pace, like a ticking bomb waiting for its explosive denouement, Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" has that electric energy that is highly reminiscent of his previous works, especially ""The Dark Knight"", it's as if one is suddenly put in an already developing dire situation that calls for the survival of the fittest. Nolan has always been great in establishing chaotic, corrupt worlds, not merely as backdrops, but as centerpieces alongside his philosophical explorations of conceptional human values and struggles through his always well-developed characters. This works well, as the viewer is suddenly sucked into a particular created universe without even any hesitations or questions asked because of its extremely elaborated believable, if not heightened, chaos; immersing in it is structurally connected to watching the story unfold; in other words, being in it is the story itself.However, this relationship between ordered chaos and effective storytelling is not as organic here as it is in his previous films; this time around, the former negates the latter to some extent. The reason is mostly because the film is dealing with a heavily metaphysical concept, and it is a huge concept at that one too, of entering into one's dreams for information and secrets. Like any works in science fiction, it is a requirement to dwell into at least some form of exposition to explain the mechanism of a certain phenomena or wonder, otherwise the story lapses into a mumbo-jumbo concoction of irrational half-conceived ideas that render the populated world of the characters and themselves implausible; this might work in the fantasy genre, which even then still requires the logistics of rationality, but in science fiction, exposition is almost always a requirement. Almost.In ""Inception"", the characters seem secondary to the film's conceptualized dream abstractions. Indeed, its treatment of dreams is original, admirable and even awe inspiring. The layering of dreams, each paralleling another at a different time, in a different place; and the set-up of rules depending on the layer of the dream is particularly impressive. Only in this film, one could say a van falling off bridge into the river, slow-motioned for about 30 minutes, completely makes sense, not to mention thoroughly heart-pounding. And the concept of 'limbo' where one could get stuck in a dream for ten years is terrifying. But the film's heavy reliance on exposition, is both a blessing and a curse.On one hand, as soon as the mechanisms and the logistics of the act of entering dreams have been verbalized, and reiterated over and over again, the film works straight-laced in its razor sharp fluidity of action, a cause-and-effect extravaganza on the basis of the conceptualizations of dreaming, depending, of course, on its whereabouts; the farther the layer is, the deeper trouble one is in. If there's one thing that one could thoroughly admire about Nolan is that his action sequences are not rumbling, arbitrary set-pieces, design to blow up buildings to impress, but both reactions and pro-actions are on the basis of a particular tense situation, populated by struggling, deciding characters. On the other hand, this same intellectualized treatment overshadows the undercurrent emotionality of the characters. The subjectivity is there, but the root of it is missing.So while the viewer is thankfully not lost in the convolutions of the film's mechanics of dreams, even when they blossom into layers after layers of intricate and florid abstractions, as sacrifice, the undermining of the individualization of the characters makes for a rather cold intellectual cinematic experience. Mind you, ""Inception"" is great cinema, but in that clean-cut, deeply concise manner; thus, a rather tame realization, as it completely misses the opportunity to really delve into the primal and raw realm that is merely glanced at during its exploration of the deep burrows of the subconscious mind. In other words, like a beautiful dream, but upon waking up, one ends up losing the profoundness and mystery of it, and instead merely comes up with a technically elaborated analysis to compensate for the failed attempt at grasping the metaphysical and grotesque intangible beauty of the dream itself. The film sports a dream chemist and a dream architect. Nolan should have included a poet or a philosopher.""Inception"" is neither as cerebral nor deep as it should be, and it could have been, if Nolan could have only have taken the time to take the concept of dream in its actual incarnation: wholly subjective, cathartic, nightmarish, emotional, intimate. One deeply misses the haunting murkiness of memory loss and the emotional and existential discourse as its results in ""Memento"". This is intelligent, ambitious, occasionally brilliant filmmaking, but it is too efficient, too caught up in its exposition, perhaps even afraid to slow down for the mainstream, that it misses the mark on being a completely visionary, abstract, transcendental work. Ironically, ""Inception"" as a film about dreams, makes complete sense, which unfortunately seems to render dreaming pointless.",4,Inception: Deceptively insighful,1279497600,"07 19,

Accordingly, I will not spoil the movie in this review.Anyone who has seen the trailers knows that the film involves people in dreams, and Christopher Nolan does a great job of not only providing the rules for how dreams work on the individuals in dreams, but finds very interesting ways of using those rules.The acting is very strong, and features a team of different specialists, each with a role to play in the dreams.Nolan keeps the action at the forefront, and at times, I lost track of trying to keep it all straight in my head.  Fortunately, the director sees the audience through, so just hod on and ride out the action scenes on top of action scenes.The effects are stunning.  I can't say enough about them.Most of all, in an era of moviemaking that seems to consist only of remakes and sequels, Inception brings some original ideas.  There are certainly elements of other films, notably the Matrix, Dreamscape, and the Thirteenth Floor to name a few. Nevertheless, this is a fresh and well-executed concept.There are a number of creative ideas which you will think about after leaving the theater.

Get the dual disc edition.]First Impressions:Christopher Nolan put together a very imaginative piece, about the development of a fictitious science that can delve into other people's minds and extract information for government or corporate use - trade secrets and the like.  The story does fall down though in not always making clear to the audience what's going on.  The actors at times mumble their words and the ""moody"" lighting becomes dull and hard to see (although that might just be my TV set).Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, the mastermind who is an expert at going into others dreams and finding secrets.  Sometimes he can go dreams within dreams.  Unfortunately the clients whose dreams he attempts to invade also have their own constructs and sometimes military force of the subconscious to take care of Cobb and his ilk.Cobb also has a major guilt complex going on.  His wife and he also explored their own inner mind except she thought the ""real"" world was in fact another dream layer and promptly killed herself.  She also created a scenario where he would be on the run from the law for her death -- wow, tough love!All these come together when Cobb is hired out by Saito, a corporate energy dealer who wants to plant an idea (an ""inception"") for Robert Fisher Jr. (Cillian Murphy) to make his own energy business, break it up and thus Saito could then deal with this competitor rather than be relegated to second rate power.To help Cobb ostensibly deal with the architect of the dreams he hires smart girl Ariadne (Ellen Page).  Though she plays her part fairly well, the character is not developed very much.  She does a lot of yelling at the guy, finds out a few of his secrets and rubs his face in his bad decision-making while on the mission (which tends to bend to his guilt), but she's not developed much.  Not a lot of romance or adventure with this character!The others of the team are similarly not well-developed.  After we get to somewhat know them, they're really throwaway characters -- vital to the plot but we don't really invest a lot of emotion into caring if they live or not.Effects:I must say the special effects were amazing.  The attention to detail, every drop of water, every piece of shattered glass, perfectly poised as in real life.  The ""zero gravity"" scene (my word for it) was amazing.  Did they have an actual room they were rotating or what was CGI?Not a lot of fight scenes in the film, although there were plenty of chase scenes in the streets and on the slopes.  The audience is shunted from scene to scene rather quickly, at times too much so.  I found myself rewinding the DVD to see what I just missed.Bottom Line:  Imaginative story, excellent fictitious science of the mind, where even with high technology we still have guilt, misunderstandings and in some cases some pretty blatant attempts at making others wrong to fill a book!  The special effects were great, but the editing was such as to at times confuse and startle.  The dialogue could have been clearer with a few less English accents (though Michael Caine, in the small part he played, was marvelous).Recommended, but you may have to have your finger on the rewind to fully follow what's going on.  The ending was fun, left a question in your mind.Directed byChristopher NolanWriting creditsChristopher Nolan  (written by)Cast (in credits orderLeonardo DiCaprio ...  CobbJoseph Gordon-Levitt ...

Anyone who finds it deep doesn't rise to the level of shallow.Specific complaints: while most modern ""action"" movies are guilty of this, the dynamic range of this soundtrack is wider than any I have yet heard. You have to turn the volume up to hear diCaprio's simian mumbling. Then they light off a pointless explosion or burst of useless machine gun fire which blows out your speakers. Awesome; now my neighbors love me.Who finds the stupid panning camera shots clever? Not me; they're tedious, nauseating and *boring.* They decidedly do not make up for the vapidity of the dialog, the over-explaining and telegraphing of absolutely everything and almost complete lack of plot. What is that you say? That the ""multilayering"" of the plot is supposed to make it clever? No, it makes it designed to appeal to the type of modern nincompoop who can't read a book without checking his cell phone or his twitter feed every two minutes. It's not clever, and it detracts from the dramatic flow in the same way that switching between TV programs to avoid commercials detracts from dramatic flow. I guess when you have enough context switches, it's harder for most people to tell how awful the plot is.The characters weren't even one dimensional characters: they are zero-dimensional characters; featureless points scattered over a landscape like bits of dandruff. Try to think of an adjective describing any one of the characters without referring to their appearance or job: you can't. The acting was horrendous; they don't act like people -they act like the human marionettes in bad TV police dramas. DiCaprio -the main character I'm supposed to sympathize with, did not change his facial expression more than a millimeter for the entire movie. The plot premise; the extremely tired, overused and moronic PKD ""oooo, am I tripping out or in reality land, maaaan?"" trope. Like we haven't seen that about a zillion times already in Science Fiction since the 50s, and mainstream movies since the 80s. It was dumb in the Matrix movies; it's offensively dumb done ... yet again in this stinker.The pacing is abysmal. The retardo-useless action scenes and atrocious CGI effects can't cover up the fact that it was literally a movie about a snooze fest.The worst thing about it is the fact that people actually seem to think it is something beyond a silly MTV video. Why do people use the word ""cerebral"" applied to this movie? Because Di Caprio was able to successfully conjugate a verb once in a while? Because of the several plot threads?

I'm not sure why that is.  I found it very entertaining and enjoyable.The film does start out in a confusing way, but the opening scenes where Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) awakes on a beach, near a Japanese castle is explained later in the film.  The subsequent scenes show a small group of people who are experts at 'extraction', stealing industrial secrets from the sleeping mind, when the brain's defenses are down.  Cobb offers his services to Saito, (Ken Watanabe), but in a different vein, to train him to protect his mind from others like Cobb who are bent on stealing his secrets.Now, they are asked to do something that is much more difficult, perhaps even impossible; not to take an idea, but to plant one into another's mind.  This time, it's rich industrialist Maurice Fischer's son, Robert, whom is sought to take his father's company into a different direction than the one his father chose.It's elaborate and complex.  In order to plant an idea, the small team led by Cobb must go not just one level down, into a dream, but beyond that, perhaps even three levels down, in other words, a dream within a dream within a dream.  In order to accomplish this, a new and perhaps dangerous sedative will be tried.  The danger, of course, is that the dreamer may die from the sedative, or more ominous, he or she may continue into the deepest level of the dream state, where hours in this world translate into years in this deepest level.  Cobb has been there before, and knows the danger.Inception is a fun romp!  There is a ton of action, as things are happening on all three levels of the dream.  There are bad guys everywhere who are manifestations of those who are trying to prevent the supposed theft of Robert's thoughts and ideas.  And then there is the wild card no one, except Cobb, expects; his dead wife, who is still very much 'alive' in his, and everyone else's, dreams.A strong recommendation for Inception.  The amount of planning that must have gone on just to write the script is fantastic.  To have it all make sense is impressive.  And, of course, the special effects are outstanding; really unbelievable.  The best effects are when Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) have to defeat the bad guys in the dreams second level.  The hotel they are in is rotating, and somehow everyone appears to float around, climb walls, and walk on the ceiling.  Fantastic job to the special effects crew!The only disappointment was the lack of interesting extras on the DVD.

1305455,A2U286F55AAA5,B002ZG980U,S. Greene,"[36, 222]","I went to see Inception in the theater, and for the second time in my life experienced the feeling of desperately wanting to get up and walk out so as to salvage at least part of the evening.  Had I been sitting on the aisle I certainly would have.  As it was, there was no choice but to sit through the whole excruciating thing, hoping beyond hope that it would end and put me out of my misery.I know others have rated the movie highly, and I respect their opinions.  At the end of the screening I went to, many of the folks leaving seemed to have really enjoyed it.  Personally, though, I think it was just awful, for three reasons: the stakes, the villains, and the writing.Comparison with The Matrix series is inevitable, because here - like in The Matrix- we have action taking place in the ""real"" world and a ""dream"" world.  Inception takes the Matrix-like concept and adds to it with multiple dream worlds, and dream worlds within dream worlds.  That idea has the potential to be interesting, so due credit there.  The first problem, though, is that the stakes in Inception are too low.  In The Matrix, success in the dream world means saving all of humanity from enslavement.  OK, that's a goal I can get invested in.  Here, success in the dream world means two things: a) the Leo DiCaprio character gets to see his kids, and b) one big energy corporation gets an advantage in the market over another big energy corporation.  Ho hum.  (Now, don't get me wrong - it's possible to make a movie where the audience gets invested in a father-child relationship, and an emotional journey comes to have high stakes.  To do that, though, the movie has to work to develop the emotional elements of the characters and the story, which Inception doesn't do.  There's so much sci-fi gimmickry, action, and special effects that there's no room left to develop a human story worth caring about.)Well, if it's not a success as a deep character study, at least it can be a good sci-fi action thriller, right?  Well, there's more hope here, but still it didn't work for me.  Here the problem is the villains.  There aren't any.  Yes, Our Heroes do a lot of fighting, but it's against random faceless gunmen who pop up and get shot down like in a videogame.  Again, compare to The Matrix: the scenes with Agent Smith talking to Morpheus, and later to Neo, give us a bad guy we can really root against, which makes the good guy more fun to root for.  Or in Die Hard, when Hans Gruber kills  the smarmy guy without qualm, it makes Hans more evil and makes it more cathartic when he loses at the end.  There isn't even a betrayal twist where one of our favorite characters turns out to be the bad guy.  Of course, the conflict here is not man-vs-man or man-vs-nature, it is man-vs-himself; but as already noted above, that takes attention to character that wasn't paid here.Finally, the writing.  There's just nothing quotable in Inception.  The closest thing to a quotable line was ""well it was worth a try"" - not going to become anyone's catch phrase.  No ""there is no spoon.""  No ""I know kung fu!""  No ""I'll be back.""At the end of the day, Inception tries to mix an action flick with an emotional journey, and succeeds at neither.

1305456,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B002ZG980U,Sheri in Reho,"[0, 0]","I saw Inception on opening day in my town. I think that the first thing I heard as the credits started rolling sums up the experience: ""what the heck?""Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom, an expert at getting inside of peoples' minds (through dreaming) and stealing their secrets (known as extraction). He has a team who help him with this, and his clients are often leaders of some of the largest and wealthiest corporations on Earth. Ken Wanatabe plays one of those leaders. But what he wants isn't an extraction, it's an inception, in which an idea is planted in the subconscious of the targeted person. Some on the team say it can't be done, but Dom moves the team forward on this mission--despite the incredible danger it holds for them all.Inception plays with space, time and matter in ways we've never seen before. It is not science fiction in the way of spaceships and alien creatures, but of the mind and its incredible powers. The visual effects are quite amazing, especially when the world is turned upside down (or sideways). The action in the film is quite intense and some sequences had people in the theatre with me on the edge of their seats--quite literally! One toward the end especially is a real mind-blower (in more ways than one).My complaint is that the concept and the story are so complex that, even with total concentration on the screen, I found it difficult to keep up with what was going on. I know I wasn't the only one in this situation, because I heard a lot of murmuring among the packed crowd to the tune of ""What just happened?"" Several few people got up and left as I think they just gave up on trying to ""get it."" Additionally, most of the characters were not fleshed out--all the ""character time"" was devoted to Dom's character.If being totally dazed and confused sounds like mad fun to you, then this is definitely your film. If it all sounds like too much work, then you may want to pick another movie.

1305461,A1VBYS3G8NQUY1,B002ZG980U,SKOLVK,"[3, 4]","Christopher Nolan has done it again. He continues to prove that he's the master of creating beautiful, layered and imaginative films. With ""Inception"" we follow Mr.Cobb(DiCaprio)and his associate Arthur(Gordon-Levitt), a duo of specially trained thieves who enter peoples minds and steal their secrets and ideas. After the film's first mission the duo is offered a job by their original target,Mr.Santio. He wants them to implant an idea into his business competitor's mind(Fischer). He wants them to make Mr.Fischer think that it's in his best interest to break up his father's business empire after his father dies. A procedure known as ""Inception"". At first Cobb and Arthur turn down the project because it's too complex and dangerous but Santio has an offer that Cobb can't refuse. If he completes this mission, Santio can pull some strings so Cobb can see his children again. Cobb, heartbroken and desperate to his children(you have to see the film as to why) agrees to take Santio's offer. Cobb and Aurthur then set out to assemble a team of other specialist to complete their mission. A mission that will prove to be more dangerous than any of them ever imagined. Without a doubt ""Inception"" is one of the most stunning and imaginative films I've ever seen. Nolan really shows that he can turn on the special effects with the best of them. People run up walls, water floats,and cities turn upside down on to themselves. As enjoyable as ""Inception"" is, it's easy to get a little lost. Seeing as the method of inception is to create multiple ""dream realms"" or dreams within dreams, you can find yourself forgetting which one you're watching. Even the characters in the movie seem to confuse themselves. In one scene that I found amusing, Ellen Page's character Aliadne chimes in ""Okay..So who's subconscious are we entering again?"".

Was it overly hyped as a complex, thinking man's movie? Granted, you do indeed need to think more about what's happening in Inception than, say for example,The Expendables(the other movie I watched this week). But at least I didn't fall asleep during my first watch through of The Expendables like I did in my first attempt at Inception.Granted, I probably started Inception a little too late on a Friday night after a couple (okay, more than a couple) of beers, but the next night I did the same with The Expendables and stayed wide awake. And this is not because I got lost in Inception's plot. It's because I got literally tired of the actors explaining what they were doing or about to do versus just doing it. ""It"" mainly being entering a person's dream, then in that dream jumping to the person's simultaneous dream, then repeating this to a third dream in the person's subconscious where time moves the slowest giving the ""jumpers"" the most amount of time to change the host's mind about an issue without the host realizing that his change of heart was inspired by outside parties (the jumpers). Yes, that was a mouthful, and not as easy to say as, ""The Expendables was an action star studded bang bang shoot 'em up flick about a bunch mercenaries that attempt to overthrow a South American dictator.""But was Inception really so complex that Director Christopher Nolan had to spend almost the first 90 minutes of the movie walking me / us through what was about to happen and how it would happen without missing a detail? Would I have gotten ""it"" without the explanations? Maybe I give myself too much credit, but I think that I would have.All that said, please don't get me wrong...it was a great movie...regardless of the ultimate length of the movie and the time Nolan spent explaining it along the way. I liked it. The special effects were out of this world. The visuals overlaying all of the explaining made the movie fun to watch (on my second attempt anyway), and when there was action it was tight, exciting and extremely well done.The cast was interesting. Leo DiCaprio is excellent as always. Ellen Page was an interesting pick; she's cute in herJunokinda way, but seemed a little out of place on the action front. Cillian Murphy was good and DiCaprio's ""dream team"" were well cast. They all made it very believable...and it would have been just as believable without all of the verbalizing they did about how and what they were doing.Bottom line: Inception is a really cool and unique movie. See it. But I'd make it a Netflix pick and buy it in later 2011 when the DVD will be even cheaper.",4,"Must Have Been A Dream; I Can't Believe Where I've Been.

1305467,A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L,B002ZG980U,Solid Snake,"[4, 4]","Inception is the type of movie that asks a lot right out of the gate. It's a bit like having a friend who owes you a ton of money promising to pay the debt with golden turds his dog started dropping after he switched puppy-chow brands. The natural temptation to respond by slapping him in his lying face is pushed aside when he presses that first, shiny, golden butt-burrito into your hands before he runs off to feed his dog again. I'm sure I could have picked a better analogy, but that one is quite accurate, and it also lets me use funny euphemisms like ""butt-burrito"".With Inception, just as with the magical ""Golden"" dog, if you stop to think about it long enough you soon realize that, not only does the story not make any sense, but you've been given a finely polished deuce in place of actual money. And it takes a lot of polishing to keep you slack-jawed and incapable of incredulity for the 2.5 hour run-time of this film. The fact that they pull it off is actually quite impressive, although having a boat-load of money certainly made it easier for them. I'm no expert and more importantly, I'm too lazy to look it up, but I'm going to go ahead and claim that the studio budget for this movie rivals the GDP of many small island nations. A-list actors, impressive sets, complex action sequences...all are tossed about with the carefree air of a Saudi Sheik who just discovered his oil fields are sitting atop vast deposits of pure heroin.Of course, all the spectacular scenery is meant to keep your eyes on the magician while his lovely assistant drops your trousers and rifles around in your body cavities. Inception is just a trick - smoke and mirrors and the occasional albino tiger wrapped in layer after layer of misdirection and executed with practiced slight-of-hand. The central plot is about as thin as soviet soup - Leo and his team of ""extractors"" specialize in dream burglary, essentially hijacking their mark's subconscious to get him/her to divulge industrial secrets, PIN numbers, their grandma's secret velvet cake recipe...whatever. How this is done is glossed over entirely - everyone hooks themselves up to a silver briefcase and it just works, ok? Now stop asking silly questions and relax your colon, because we're just getting started.See, Inception is not just another dream movie. Apparently, a single dream world where anything is possible was simply too limiting, and to break out of the straightjacket of infinite possibilities you need to go into a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream.....you get the idea. The only thing necessary to pull this off is another silver briefcase for each successive dream, an easy matter given that you can essentially drop whatever you want to into these dreams. You've just been handed the golden, impossible deuce: the mechanics of this concept are never adequately explained yet the consequences of traveling through multiple dream ""levels"" are central to the story.That's not to say it's a bad movie. Oh, I'm sorry...did the previous paragraphs deceive you into thinking this movie was a big pile of suck? Well, it depends on whether or not you decide to take the golden deuce to the bank or not. If you're willing to accept that gold is gold then it does not matter what shape it's in or even what orifice it was excreted from. You deposit the deposit (snicker) and go about your business. You can do the same thing with Inception: take the story at face value and ignore that little part of you that scoffs in disbelief and you'll have no problem enjoying this film. If you can't help but see through the smoke and mirrors it will only become more ridiculous with each passing minute.I recommend you give this movie a shot, mainly because it is a massively ambitious story to tell in this format and, despite its short comings, manages to be riveting and original. The third act is a masterful display of tight pacing, tying together multiple timelines with fluid precision while never letting up the suspense. I found myself unable to stop watching, even when the ending became more or less predictable, and I respect the ambition of the story enough to jettison my complaints about its execution. I don't think it will ever become the instant classic, genre-inventing film that it was hyped up to be, but it explores interesting territory (albeit superficially), and makes for an excellent viewing experience.

I knew the basic premise of the film from the trailer, but this had so much more going for it than I had hoped to imagine.This follows a team who usually enter dreams to steal information from the dreamer (extraction), but in this case go into a dream to plant information (inception). This is the basic premise, but the levels of detail and philosophy behind the idea make this something more than your run of the mill Hollywood extravaganza. I won't ruin it by going into much more detail here, suffice to say there is more to the film than just that basic idea.Everyone in this film is acting at the top of their game and the special effects (whilst reminiscent of `The Matrix' in places) are simply excellent. This manages to come up with quite a complex storyline, but you are never left feeling lost or unsure of where you are, apart from the deliberately ambiguous ending which leaves things open to your open interpretation after leaving the main bulk of the story tied up in a highly satisfying way.This managed to hold my attention for the whole duration (without my mind wandering once) and I was often on the edge of my seat or emotionally involved with the characters. Ken Watanabe is as great as we have come to expect and DiCaprio also turns out a stellar performance.

However, the reason that Leonardo Di Caprio stands out in a good way in this movie is due to the fact that I feel that he has given one of his best performances since ""Titanic"". I, like many others, first heard of him through the movie ""Titanic"". Leo plays as Domm Cobb, one of the men who has a very influential role in getting information from others through their dreams. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, as Leo's competent assistant who helps him recruit a reluctant protege (Ellen Page) to help in accomplishing a job given out to him by Mr. Saito, the tourist. Along the way Dom and Arthur mastermind getting help from others to accomplish their dream assignments. The plot is very well put together with vivid imagery on how dreams can turn out.

Lots of excitement and unexpected surprises.2. The acting was top notch. DiCaprio is a genius and the rest of the cast was fantastic.3. The special effects were mind bending, imaginative and well done.4. The concept of conscious dreaming and invading someone else's dreams to manipulate them is both fascinating and frightening. The story was deep and intricate. It was a great scifi concept with plenty of creativity.Cons:1. This movie is very challenging to follow. To give you an idea so you can judge for yourself - We're both college grads with post graduate courses. If you look back at my previous movie reviews you'll see that when others find a movie hard to follow, I usually have no problem with it. Yet with this movie I think I'd have to watch it several times to really comprehend all of what was going on. Both my wife and I were lost a lot. In the end, I think we figured out the overall story, but there were long periods of just feeling lost and confused. This was frustrating. I see that the featured reviewer on the Amazon page mentions that she and her 11 year old brother understood it, but I think they must be Mensa geniuses.2. The manipulative nature of what the main characters were trying to accomplish made it harder to root for DiCaprio and his team. (Kind of a SPOILER: They were to make a decent man dismantle the company that was his inheritance by planting ideas in his subconscious.) Though the client hiring them to do this said it was to prevent a monopoly, it didn't seem completely right. They were risking this guys life for their own profit.Final recommendation: I'm a huge sci-fi fan, and this is not one of my favorite sci-fi movies. However it's still worth seeing for the Pros up above, especially if you like sci-fi or special effects movies. I'd recommend seeing it on DVD so you can rewind and rewatch it to get the story straight.",4,"Creative, full of action, but hard to follow",1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,1978,"['movie', 'pros', 'cons', 'Here', 'what', 'wife', 'think.Pros:1', 'lot', 'action', 'Lots', 'excitement', 'unexpected', 'surprises.2', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'DiCaprio', 'genius', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'fantastic.3', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'mind', 'bending', 'imaginative', 'well', 'done.4', 'concept', 'conscious', 'dreaming', 'invading', 'someone', 'else', 'dreams', 'manipulate', 'fascinating', 'frightening', 'story', 'was', 'deep', 'intricate', 'was', 'great', 'scifi', 'concept', 'plenty', 'creativity.Cons:1', 'movie', 'very', 'challenging', 'follow', 'give', 'idea', 'so', 'can', 'judge', ""'re"", 'college', 'grads', 'post', 'graduate', 'courses', 'look', 'back', 'previous', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'when', 'others', 'find', 'movie', 'hard', 'follow', 'usually', 'have', 'problem', 'movie', 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'really', 'comprehend', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'wife', 'were', 'lost', 'lot', 'end', 'think', 'figured', 'out', 'overall', 'story', 'were', 'long', 'periods', 'just', 'feeling', 'lost', 'confused', 'was', 'frustrating', 'see', 'featured', 'reviewer', 'Amazon', 'page', 'mentions', '11', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'understood', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'Mensa', 'geniuses.2', 'manipulative', 'nature', 'what', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'made', 'harder', 'root', 'DiCaprio', 'team', 'Kind', 'SPOILER', 'were', 'make', 'decent', 'man', 'company', 'was', 'inheritance', 'planting', 'ideas', 'subconscious', 'client', 'hiring', 'do', 'said', 'was', 'prevent', 'monopoly', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'completely', 'right', 'were', 'risking', 'guys', 'life', 'own', 'profit.Final', 'recommendation', ""'m"", 'huge', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'However', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Pros', 'up', 'above', 'especially', 'like', 'sci-fi', 'special', 'effects', 'movies', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'can', 'rewind', 'rewatch', 'get', 'story', 'straight']",N/A

1305478,A3O886DD5BZO8O,B002ZG980U,Steve D. Heckenlively,"[5, 6]","Like others, I went to this with zero advertising exposure. My only decision point was that it's a Chris Nolan movie. I'm also one of those people who like Batman Begins much better than The Dark Knight.Having seen Inception, I agree absolutely on 3 points: 1) The less you know going in the first time, the better off you are. 2) You must see it at least 2 times. 3) It is far, far better the 2nd time you see it.Here's my advice: See it once. Read the interviews with Nolan and Dicaprio, read about what was their primary creative goal. Wait a week or two. Then see it a second time, and be prepared to be knocked on your ass.I have to confess, another reason I saw Inception was that Avatar utterly blew me away. I saw Avatar twice, and I found it mind-boggling. It wasn't just the technology, even more, it was the character of Neytiri. I still think that Zoe Saldana caused a brain-fry in the Academy Award nominating process. Yet great as the acting is in Avatar, I think the acting in Inception is even better, because that's Inception's focus. If you get inside this movie, you will be on a first-name basis with every character that has a name. They are all etched in a living flame.I wanted Inception to convince me that Avatar had not rendered ""conventional"" movie making obsolete. Mission accomplished. How? I believe the characters of Inception are even stronger than the characters of Avatar, because Inception is based in a world everyone already knows. Nolan and the actors and actresses were able to devote themselves to making the best characters they possibly could. Inception may be the greatest ensemble movie ever made, and I include The Magnificent Seven.I will also say that I see a certain ethos within Inception. Again, I don't want to give it away. Everyone deserves a chance to see the movie and interpret it for themselves. But for me, I rank Inception as equal among the greatest movies I have ever seen. Dom and Mal, and all these people, will live inside me so long as I live.",5,"Inception Creates People, Avatar Creates a World: You Choose",1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,2008,"['others', 'went', 'zero', 'advertising', 'exposure', 'only', 'decision', 'point', 'was', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'movie', ""'m"", 'also', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'much', 'better', 'Dark', 'Knight.Having', 'seen', 'Inception', 'agree', 'absolutely', '3', 'points', '1', 'less', 'know', 'going', 'first', 'time', 'better', 'are', '2', 'must', 'see', 'least', '2', 'times', '3', 'far', 'far', 'better', '2nd', 'time', 'see', 'advice', 'See', 'once', 'Read', 'interviews', 'Nolan', 'Dicaprio', 'read', 'what', 'was', 'primary', 'creative', 'goal', 'Wait', 'week', 'two', 'Then', 'see', 'second', 'time', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'knocked', 'ass.I', 'have', 'confess', 'reason', 'saw', 'Inception', 'was', 'Avatar', 'utterly', 'blew', 'away', 'saw', 'Avatar', 'twice', 'found', 'mind-boggling', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'technology', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'character', 'Neytiri', 'still', 'think', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'caused', 'brain-fry', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominating', 'process', 'Yet', 'great', 'acting', 'Avatar', 'think', 'acting', 'Inception', 'even', 'better', 'Inception', 'focus', 'get', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'first-name', 'basis', 'character', 'name', 'are', 'etched', 'living', 'flame.I', 'wanted', 'Inception', 'convince', 'Avatar', 'had', 'not', 'rendered', 'conventional', 'movie', 'making', 'obsolete', 'Mission', 'accomplished', 'How', 'believe', 'characters', 'Inception', 'are', 'even', 'stronger', 'characters', 'Avatar', 'Inception', 'based', 'world', 'everyone', 'already', 'Nolan', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'able', 'devote', 'making', 'best', 'characters', 'possibly', 'could', 'Inception', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'ensemble', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'include', 'Magnificent', 'Seven.I', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'see', 'certain', 'ethos', 'Inception', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'Everyone', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', 'interpret', 'rank', 'Inception', 'equal', 'greatest', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Dom', 'Mal', 'people', 'will', 'live', 'so', 'long', 'live']",N/A

1305480,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B002ZG980U,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[2, 4]","Every year, Hollywood shells out products that serve no other purpose than to bore audiences into a state of stupidity. This has been a problem for years, since the birth of the blockbuster. In the late sixties and early seventies, mainstream audiences frequently enjoyed intellectually stimulating films, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and TAXI DRIVER. That was until STAR WARS was unleashed upon the world, and everyone threw their brains out the window and settled for pure spectacle. Not much has changed. Audiences still crave style over substance. If you don't believe me, check out the box office results for AVATAR, and then get back to me. A Hollywood film with a brain is a rare thing these days.But every now and again, I have to insert my foot into my mouth. INCEPTION is one of the most intelligent, completely involving mainstream films since THE MATRIX took the world by storm in 1999. INCEPTION will blow you away. I've already seen this film twice, and I will see it again.Where to begin. INCEPTION is one of those extraordinary films that is inherently hard to describe, yet easy to comprehend whilst you are in the theatre experiencing it firsthand. It deals with one of my favorite subjects: dreams. We not only deal with dreams, but dreams within dreams within dreams. With all of the complex layering going on, it could be easy to lose yourself - which is why I'm going to give you the most simple synopsis that I can muster in this review. It will be short, sweet, and to the point.The film deals with a man named Dom Cobb, an experienced thief who utilizes the best of modern technology to enter the subconscious dreamworlds of others, and steal their most precious secrets and ideas. This process is known as ""extraction"". Because of this, Cobb is one of the most sought after fugitives in the business. When his latest assignment goes awry, he is offered a chance to redeem himself by pulling off a seemingly impossible ""inception"" - a process by which an idea is planted into an individuals mind. In order to do this, Cobb must put together a team of experts and race against the clock in order to successfully execute the mission.This is just the tip of the iceberg. Much more goes on within the two and a half hour running time. To say anything else would only spoil the film for you, and rob you of the pure rush that comes from watching such cinematic genius.Christopher Nolan is at the top of his game here. His direction is flawless, and his confidence in his cast and crew is visible on screen. This is his best film since MEMENTO, and it's just as puzzling. Yes, there are special effects in this film, but they do not take precedence over the story or performances. They are merely a part of the world that Christopher Nolan has so expertly crafted. After seeing INCEPTION, I have officially forgiven Nolan for those overrated Batman films.The performances from the entire cast are amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, and Marion Cotillard shine. Everyone else is just as good. There is even a cameo from Michael Caine, as well. Hans Zimmer's score may as well be counted as another character in the film, as it is that powerful. It's one of those scores that audiences will recognize whenever they hear it play for years to come.INCEPTION is a gift.

1305481,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,B002ZG980U,Steven A. Peterson,"[3, 6]","This is a movie that grew on me as I watched it. The first part was slow and almost incomprehensible to me; I seriously thought of walking out of the theater. But as the sponsor of the ""dream team,"" Saito, began to make clear what he really wanted--the breakup of a competitor's business empire, the movie gains clarity and focus and begins to move ahead with great energy.The first issue is keeping the cast members in mind. The ""team"" developed by protagonist Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) includes an array of professionals--an architect (Ariadne, played by Ellen Page), Eames (played by Tom Hardy), Yusuf (a chemist who develops sedatives to facilitate the dream process--especially if there are dreams within dreams [the movie, at one point, goes four dreams deep]), and Arthur. The normal goal of Cobb and his partners is ""extraction,"" getting information through entering dreams--and even manipulating dreams. In this case, Saito wants ""inception,"" introducing an idea into the mind of his competitor, Robert Fischer, son of Maurice, who had developed a business empire that threatens to overwhelm Saito's concerns. The idea would lead Robert to dismantle his father's empire and allow greater competitive room for Saito (at the beginning, needless to say, this and other threads are hard to keep in mind).Then, they build the scheme--to function at three levels. The top dream involves a chase; the next layer occurs in a hotel room; the third layer in a winter wilderness. Violence occurs at each level as ""projections"" from Fischer's mind emerge in the dreams. And, making the schemes developed by Cobb's team more difficult, his wife, Mal, who had killed herself believing that she was still in a dream, shows up as a projection in his ""capers.""

1305494,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,B002ZG980U,"technoguy ""jack""","[0, 1]","Like Hitchcock and Kubrick, Nolan has the tendency to work out every last detail of his characters as if they were algebraic equations, to be worked out but without the existential heart or mystery.In the factory of dreams that is film, Nolan has developed an idea with such breath-taking virtuousity,planned action sequences of great splendour,that we are apt to overlook his inability to create believable characters that move you.Still you know this film could only get made using Nolan's expertise and DiCaprio's star power.The beating heart of the film comes from Mal(Cotillard) locked up in the subconscious of Cobb(diCaprio).Elaine Page(Ariadne)is an androgynous figure, explaining to the audience via questions or to provide exposition on her own terms,eg when Cobb lays down the rules of shared dreaming to us through Ariadne.Since The Dark Knight,Nolan has been handed the keys to Hollywood to open up a Pandara's box of special efx,making a Faustian pact with the machinery of film, emphasising tendencies already latent in The Prestige and Memento to use trickery to hide a hollowness in his story-telling,a lack of soul,hidden by trap-doors,symbols,hidden secrets. The striking visualization comes from poverty rather than wealth.The plot needs explaining as it proceeds, disengaging you emotionally. Nolan has learned all the techniques of direction at the expense of emotion. Everything is done by sleight-of-hand as in previous films.His staging of dream-within-dream and dream-within-dream-within-dream,are cleverly conceived,highly-wrought constructions,with the conscious levels realized at the expense of the subconscious levels,affecting the latter dreamscape with meticulous,crafted logicality. Most breathtaking are the implosion of a Parisian boulevard, a runaway train careening down a Los Angeles thoroughfare, and a midair tussle in a hotel corridor.The team members break off in rear-guards,defending one level so the rest can continue on in dreams-within-dreams. Nolan cross-cuts between each stage as synchronized alarm clocks tick toward zero, while surface actions send rippling reactions along the chain.On each level time runs at a different rate.There are hard-and-fast rules in this psychological pinball-in-a-dreamscape.The dreamworlds are carefully constructed by imaginative architects like Ariadne.Mess with the physics of the dreamworlds too much, and peoples' minds that are being heisted by extraction or inception,rebel against the unreality. The main characters are trapped four levels deep within a dream, racing against time, unable to tell real from fake and trying to escape up the chain of dreams before it all collapses into mind-melting nothingness.At the lowest level there is a James Bondian assault on a snowbound fortress,that seemed a clich&eacute;. Extractors are skilled in the art of inducing a dream in their target, creating an imaginary world in their mind, occupying that world, and using that imagination against them to find and steal their secrets.Nolan plays around with the idea that reality is a construct in our heads,how real is the `real' world?He has no distinction between waking feelings and dream thoughts and feelings. There are derivations from other films: 2001, eXistenz,Cocteau's Orpheus,Last Year at Marienbad and The Matrix.Cobb is similar to the character DiCaprio played in Shutter Island,driven by memories of a dead wife. ""The catharsis"" at the center of Inception is based on Cobb's choice: whether to go on permanent vacation with his dream-memory of Mal, or to return to real life. It's deciding between eternity with a bitchy wraith, presumably sexless, like all of Inception's subconscious, or . . . that recurring sentimental snapshot-memory of his children?Nolan needs to just deal with ordinary people in the real world,bringing in more real world topics and concerns.Pare down,cut back.Become like Beckett to Joyce.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",4,"""So whose subconscious are we hacking into now?""(Ariadne)",1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,3992,"['Hitchcock', 'Kubrick', 'Nolan', 'tendency', 'work', 'out', 'last', 'detail', 'characters', 'were', 'algebraic', 'equations', 'be', 'worked', 'out', 'existential', 'heart', 'mystery.In', 'factory', 'dreams', 'film', 'Nolan', 'developed', 'idea', 'such', 'breath-taking', 'virtuousity', 'planned', 'action', 'sequences', 'great', 'splendour', 'are', 'apt', 'overlook', 'inability', 'create', 'believable', 'characters', 'move', 'you.Still', 'know', 'film', 'could', 'only', 'get', 'made', 'using', 'Nolan', 'expertise', 'DiCaprio', 'star', 'power.The', 'beating', 'heart', 'film', 'Mal', 'Cotillard', 'locked', 'up', 'subconscious', 'Cobb', 'diCaprio', '.Elaine', 'Page', 'Ariadne', 'androgynous', 'figure', 'explaining', 'audience', 'questions', 'provide', 'exposition', 'own', 'terms', 'eg', 'when', 'Cobb', 'rules', 'shared', 'dreaming', 'Ariadne.Since', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Nolan', 'been', 'handed', 'keys', 'Hollywood', 'open', 'up', 'Pandara', 'box', 'special', 'efx', 'making', 'Faustian', 'pact', 'machinery', 'film', 'emphasising', 'tendencies', 'already', 'latent', 'Prestige', 'Memento', 'use', 'trickery', 'hide', 'hollowness', 'story-telling', 'lack', 'soul', 'hidden', 'trap-doors', 'symbols', 'hidden', 'secrets', 'striking', 'visualization', 'poverty', 'rather', 'wealth.The', 'plot', 'needs', 'explaining', 'disengaging', 'emotionally', 'Nolan', 'learned', 'techniques', 'direction', 'expense', 'emotion', 'Everything', 'done', 'sleight-of-hand', 'previous', 'films.His', 'staging', 'dream-within-dream', 'dream-within-dream-within-dream', 'are', 'cleverly', 'conceived', 'highly-wrought', 'constructions', 'conscious', 'levels', 'realized', 'expense', 'subconscious', 'levels', 'affecting', 'latter', 'dreamscape', 'meticulous', 'crafted', 'logicality', 'Most', 'breathtaking', 'are', 'implosion', 'Parisian', 'boulevard', 'runaway', 'train', 'careening', 'down', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'thoroughfare', 'midair', 'tussle', 'hotel', 'corridor.The', 'team', 'members', 'break', 'off', 'rear-guards', 'defending', 'one', 'level', 'rest', 'can', 'continue', 'dreams-within-dreams', 'cross-cuts', 'stage', 'synchronized', 'alarm', 'clocks', 'tick', 'zero', 'surface', 'actions', 'send', 'rippling', 'reactions', 'chain.On', 'level', 'time', 'different', 'rate.There', 'are', 'hard-and-fast', 'rules', 'psychological', 'pinball-in-a-dreamscape.The', 'dreamworlds', 'are', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'imaginative', 'architects', 'Ariadne.Mess', 'physics', 'dreamworlds', 'too', 'much', 'peoples', 'minds', 'are', 'being', 'heisted', 'extraction', 'inception', 'rebel', 'unreality', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'trapped', 'four', 'levels', 'deep', 'dream', 'racing', 'time', 'unable', 'tell', 'real', 'fake', 'trying', 'escape', 'up', 'chain', 'dreams', 'mind-melting', 'lowest', 'level', 'James', 'Bondian', 'assault', 'snowbound', 'fortress', 'seemed', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Extractors', 'are', 'skilled', 'art', 'inducing', 'dream', 'target', 'creating', 'imaginary', 'world', 'mind', 'occupying', 'world', 'using', 'imagination', 'find', 'steal', 'secrets.Nolan', 'idea', 'reality', 'construct', 'heads', 'how', 'real', 'real', 'world', 'distinction', 'waking', 'feelings', 'dream', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'are', 'derivations', 'other', 'films', '2001', 'eXistenz', 'Cocteau', 'Orpheus', 'Last', 'Year', 'Marienbad', 'Matrix.Cobb', 'similar', 'character', 'DiCaprio', 'played', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'driven', 'memories', 'dead', 'wife', 'catharsis', 'center', 'Inception', 'based', 'Cobb', 'choice', 'go', 'permanent', 'vacation', 'dream-memory', 'Mal', 'return', 'real', 'life', 'deciding', 'eternity', 'bitchy', 'wraith', 'presumably', 'sexless', 'Inception', 'subconscious', 'recurring', 'sentimental', 'snapshot-memory', 'children', 'Nolan', 'just', 'deal', 'ordinary', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'bringing', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'topics', 'concerns.Pare', 'down', 'cut', 'back.Become', 'Beckett', 'Joyce.']",N/A

Create another masterpiece with a little film called Inception.  The plot is a little hard to describe but I'll try.  Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb (played by Leonard Dicaprio in an oscar-worthy performance).  Cobb is a professional theif but not in a conventional way.  He uses a piece of technology that was originally developed by the military to allow its soldiers to injury and kill each other without actually doing it to each other.  He uses it to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets.  He's also on the run from the police for something they believed he did.  After failing his last job. he is offered another one from the same person he was trying to steal secrets from but this job will be his hardest one yet.  The client wants him to perform Inception.  Its basically the reverse of what Cobb does.  Instead of stealing something from a person's mind, the client wants Cobb to put an idea into his competition's mind.  It is described at being very hard and the film does a very good job at explaining why.  In fact, it not only does a very good job at explaining this technology but it also explains dreams, ideas and a bunch of other things that you would not expect.  Even though it explains everything, it doesn't insult the audience's intelligence.  You might think that might just be a standard heist movie but with Christopher Nolan as writer and director, it is far from standard.  It has depth, intelligence and creativity.  I don't think there has ever been a movie like this.  It is part heist movie, part action adventure and part character study.  There is nothing bad that you can say about this movie.  The performances, script, direction, music, editing, visual effects, etc, were all top notch.  It is a crying shame that for as many Oscars this film was nominated for, Leonard Dicaprio did not receive a Best Actor nomination and an abomination that Christopher Nolan was not nominated for Best Director yet again for creating another masterpiece.  Films don't direct themselves.  If you are interested in a compelling, character driven, mind-bending film, I highly recommend this one and I'm surely that a lot of other people would too.",5,Another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,2282,"['have', 'just', 'directed', 'masterpiece', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'follow-up', 'Create', 'masterpiece', 'little', 'film', 'called', 'Inception', 'plot', 'little', 'hard', 'describe', ""'ll"", 'try', 'Inception', 'story', 'Dom', 'Cobb', 'played', 'Leonard', 'Dicaprio', 'oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Cobb', 'professional', 'theif', 'not', 'conventional', 'way', 'piece', 'technology', 'was', 'originally', 'developed', 'military', 'allow', 'soldiers', 'injury', 'kill', 'other', 'actually', 'doing', 'other', 'enter', 'people', 'dreams', 'steal', 'secrets', 'also', 'run', 'police', 'something', 'believed', 'did', 'failing', 'last', 'job', 'offered', 'one', 'same', 'person', 'was', 'trying', 'steal', 'secrets', 'job', 'will', 'be', 'hardest', 'one', 'yet', 'client', 'perform', 'Inception', 'basically', 'reverse', 'what', 'Cobb', 'Instead', 'stealing', 'something', 'person', 'mind', 'client', 'Cobb', 'put', 'idea', 'competition', 'mind', 'described', 'being', 'very', 'hard', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'why', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'technology', 'also', 'dreams', 'ideas', 'bunch', 'other', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'Even', 'everything', ""n't"", 'insult', 'audience', 'intelligence', 'might', 'think', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'standard', 'heist', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'writer', 'director', 'far', 'standard', 'depth', 'intelligence', 'creativity', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'there', 'ever', 'been', 'movie', 'part', 'heist', 'movie', 'part', 'action', 'adventure', 'part', 'character', 'study', 'nothing', 'bad', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'performances', 'script', 'direction', 'music', 'editing', 'visual', 'effects', 'etc', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'crying', 'shame', 'as', 'many', 'Oscars', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Leonard', 'Dicaprio', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'abomination', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'yet', 'again', 'creating', 'masterpiece', 'Films', 'do', ""n't"", 'direct', 'are', 'interested', 'compelling', 'character', 'driven', 'mind-bending', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', ""'m"", 'surely', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'would', 'too']",N/A
1305503,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B002ZG980U,The Cool Guy,"[3, 12]","I had heard good things about this movie. I wanted to like it, but in the end, it just didn't do much for me.It's not that it was a bad movie. It just seemed a little overblown, overcomplicated, and overdramatic for what was actually going on.You know the plot. Good ol' Leo enters people's minds, sneaks around there, and steals (or perhaps plants) information. Sounds like a decent enough sci-fi yarn, doesn't it? I love themes like that, in themselves. Sort of a Dreamscape meets The Matrix, all focusing on the question: ""What is real?""But the movie bogs down. Mainly it gets so caught up in ""rules"" that it loses itself. For example:1. You need an ""architect"" to create the dream.2. Subconscious people will try to kill you.3. Time flows slower the deeper you go, /10, /100, /1000.4. The feeling of falling is one of the few things that will wake you up.5. Getting killed while in a regular dream will wake you up, UNLESS...6. You are killed while sedated, in which case you will go into ""Limbo"".7. And etc, etc, etc... until you don't even care anymore.I mean really. I understand the need to have some consistency in a made-up movie universe. But since when do dreams follow ANY rules? The obsession the film creators had here in sticking to a bunch of arbitrary ""rules"" bordered on OCD.And apparently you can't just wake up from a dream. You have to be ""kicked"". And if you are having a dream within a dream, you have to wake up in the deeper dream before you will wake up in the upper dream. Or else you may fall into a deeper dream and from which you cannot wake up, and- uh... something. Sorry, lost track there. If any of that seems overly complicated to you, let's just say that you are far more intelligent than the all-too-clever people who produced this movie. That or you and are both too dumb to ""appreciate"" it, fanboys will charge, no doubt.And that's another gripe I have about this movie. The subject - dreams. It lends itself to such awesome writing, really limited only by the imagination. But the dreams in this movie were so unimaginative. They were flat, boring, downright lifeless! How could that be? Why should dreams be limited only to city streets and urban apartments? I guess by those standards, the snow base is considered imaginative. How about a city in the sky, instead? And I think my subconscious would be defended by dragons and monsters, not chicago-esque gangsters with machine guns, thank you very much! Really, for a movie about dreams, what you see here is completely underwhelming.I also disliked the special effects thrown in for no reason. Wow. A city block exploding in slow motion. And this is profound? Why? I kept getting the feeling the filmmakers were trying to plant their own idea in my head. ""Be impressed! Be very impressed NOW!"" Only I wasn't. If I wanted to watch random stuff being blown up for no reason, I'd watch something by Michael Bay. (I'm talking to YOU, Transformers!)The movie also featured a bunch of action sequences I didn't much care about. Where the Matrix was stylish and cool in this regard, Inception takes the route of ""gritty realism"", and falls completely flat. Gritty realism in a dream? Why? Of course, it never made any sense to me why so many people were required to be in the dream in the first place, so I never really cared one way or another when any of them were in danger.The action is nonstop, but ultimately ""much ado about nothing"". We cut back and forth between dreams, with non-existent drama in each one. (I mean, repeated slow motion scenes of people falling a van? Really?) It seems silly to me the way the movie tried to get you to care what happens in one of the upper dreams, when you already know good and well that it won't have any impact whatsoever until they finish doing what they came to do in the lower dreams.And I really wanted to care about the characters too, but they just seemed kind of soulless. Just gun-wielding morons, really. As an actor I especially like Tom Hardy, bless him. But there just wasn't much for him to do here except shoot a bunch of people. Leo gets most of the character building. And that's okay; he does a convincing enough job. It just left me wanting more. I think the movie would have done a lot better with 75% less characters and 75% less gunfights.Something else that was really irritating was the ridiculous, overdramatic music. Music in movies is essential. But this just kept droning on and on. The seriousness just never let up! After a while, the dramatic music just starts weighing on you. By the end, I just felt like saying, ""Enough already! Sheesh!""There are two things I didn't get. ***SPOILERS AHEAD***So if you spin a top in the dream world, it spins forever. But if you spin it in the real world, it falls down. This is how you know you are in the real world or not. But what about if you dream that it falls down? I mean, why couldn't you? For a movie that cares so much about logic, they sure skipped over that one.I didn't understand the ending with the father on the deathbed. So he opens the safe, and finds the pinwheel. And his father says some kind words. Only in real life, he never really opened anything, did he? And his father didn't say anything nice. And above all that, who actually did any ""Incepting""? I thought Leo was supposed to put the idea in the guy's head. Only he did that stuff on his own, apparently. So the whole idea of the movie crumbles and falls flat right there! I thought the point was for the guy to get an idea. Not for him to hallucinate events that completely did not happen at all. It just didn't make any sense.""Inception"". They kept repeating the word throughout, as if it carried profound meaning. Well, how about we look that up in a dictionary? It just means ""beginning"". That's it. Any meaning beyond that is just invented by this movie. And that's about as deep a thought as this movie will bring you, unfortunately.",2,Meh...,1315612800,"09 10, 2011",2011,5921,"['had', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'wanted', 'like', 'end',

It's getting harder to find movies to add to my collection that are not boring, predictable, disgusting or offensive.  This great movie is none of these.  Complex, multi-layered plot (no spoilers here) intense action, beautiful cinematography.  Plot is at times a bit hard to follow, but this is a good thing.  But not a movie to have on when you're walking around the room, catching up on your e-mail, or talking on the phone.What I liked:  mind-bending plot is a refreshing change from same-old, same-old, dumbed-down movie fare these days.  Cinematography is fantastic (opening Chinese castle scene is my favorite).  Action is very intense, but nary a car being blown up (for once).  DiCaprio is very good, and good supporting cast.  Could name lots more.What I didn't like:  I can't think of much, my rating is that this film is definitely a cut above the usual fare.  But the multi-layered plot-within-a-plot-within-a-plot could be too involved for some viewers to follow, especially if they just want to relax with some predictable action fare, that doesn't make you pay too close attention to enjoy it.  And if dreams have bad associations for you, rather than good, you might find some of the themes in this movie disturbing.

1305523,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002ZG980U,Turfseer,"[5, 11]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Before Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to play the lead part in 'Inception', he spent months with Christopher Nolan trying to improve the script. It was at DiCaprio's insistence that the part he was playing, Cobb, the corporate dream extractor, had to have a more beefed up internal arc. Otherwise, Inception would turn out to be another shallow, action adventure thriller. Despite Cobb's triumph over his internal demons (particularly the way in which he expunges his dead wife, who has been haunting him in his subconscious), Inception is much more an exploration of the mechanics of dreaming than a chronicle of emotional catharsis.At the basic level, Inception can be divided into four distinct parts: Intro, Exposition, Journey and Resolution. The Intro consists of the initial scene, a flashback where Cobb must save his employer, a sleazy Japanese businessman, Saito, now far advanced in years, who has been stuck in a limbo-like purgatory for decades, unaware that he was mortally wounded in someone else's dream. It's a nice, little compact scene where we see a near-dead Cobb, washed up on a beach and dragged into Saito's fortress compound. A gun is left on the table in front of Saito and we're trying to figure out whether Saito is going to kill Cobb or himself.Cut to the next scene where Cobb and his associate are involved in a trying to extract information from a much younger Saito inside one of his dreams, as they all sleep on a bullet train somewhere in Japan. Apparently, Saito was expecting the dream extractors and informs them that this is their 'audition'; the extractors' 'architect', the guy in charge of designing the dreamworld, somehow lets things get out of control when a mob of men invade the room where they're all staying, and Saito later has his thugs toss the architect off the roof of a heliport. Despite the botched job, Saito is impressed that Cobb and his partner are able to move through different 'levels' in the dreamworld. Cobb's 'audition' could have been compressed into one or two minutes but Nolan insists on illustrating every aspect of his convoluted plot. We finally arrive at the film's inciting incident: Saito's proposal to Cobb that he enter the dream world of his business rival, Fischer, and plant a suggestion in his subconscious, leading to the dissolution of the rival's entire business empire. 'Inception' is the reverse of what Cobb and his team have been trained to do--extracting information and Cobb has doubts about successfully carrying out Saito's proposal. But when Saito promises to pull some strings, enabling Cobb to return to the United States, despite murder charges hanging over his head, Cobb can't resist jumping at the chance to see his two children again.The next part of 'Inception', the 'exposition', takes about an hour. This is where Cobb assembles his new carefully selected ""Mission Impossible"" superstar team who will penetrate Fischer's mind and plant the suggestion to break up his dying father's business empire. Nolan's explanation of the mechanics of the dreamworld is so complicated, that he has Cobb explain it to his new architect, a naive graduate student who manages to acquit herself rather well despite facing major obstacles inside multiple dreamworlds. Nolan manages to violate a major tenet of screen writing technique: Show don't tell. Unfortunately, during these expository sequences, there's a lot more 'tell' than 'show'. Yes, there is a rather neat scene (reminiscent of an M. C. Escher illustration), where one Paris landscape folds on top of another but most of the visuals are much more mundane: for example, a speeding locomotive appears out of nowhere during a car chase on a Paris street.Much has been written about the 'journey' aspect of 'Inception'. Critics seem to be impressed by the three dreamworlds the 'dream team' penetrates, coupled with the way in which they're able to return to reality--the so-called 'kicks', where a huge sound or explosion propels them through the different levels back up to the surface. Nolan, however, serves up some of the dullest and derivative landscapes that our 'heroes' must navigate through--in fact, these so-called dreams don't look like dreams at all. Take Level 1--just a typical shoot em up with faceless bad guys chasing the 'good guys'. As for level 2--I felt I was watching a parody of Space Odyssey, with our dreamers floating through a hotel without the benefit of gravity. Finally, I have heard 'Level 3', compared to 'Ice Station Zebra', the schlocky 60s action film set in the Arctic.Inception's Resolution is as unsatisfying as the earlier parts of the film. What are we to make of Cobb? Just because he has made this deal with Saito and it enables him to see his children, does not mitigate the fact that the whole plan to literally change Fischer's mind, is reprehensible. After all, shouldn't have Cobb walked away when Saito had his men murder the first architect? Cobb, by and large, remains a tainted and unsympathetic character, precisely because he looks the other way when he's quite aware that Saito has committed murder.We're also told (by Saito) that the breakup of Fischer's empire is a good thing but should we take his word for it? He's a thug and Nolan has provided us nothing to go on to evaluate the nature of the Fischer empire. Finally, why does Fischer cry at his father's deathbed? He's just learned that his father put his mother in a mental institution so shouldn't he be angry? Or are those tears of joy so that he can be now 'his own man'?The bulk of 'Inception' is merely a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s when the genre was in full bloom. The long-winded 'B' story, Cobb's tortured machinations in trying to literally kick his dead wife out of his subconscious mind, merely serves to distract us from the hollowness of the overall plot.",2,Sort of like a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,5917,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Before',

What if that power allowed you to dive into the deepest depths of the human mind? From Christopher Nolan's mind comes Inception.This is the story of a man whose job is to invade people's dreams in order to plant ideas into others minds and take them for the purposes of business. Yet, his history of his work is much deeper than what people know. He now has to take on one final task with a new recruit and his best team to find one of the most important ideas that can change the modern world.This film is probably one of the most well put together that came out this year. The actors chosen all played their roles beautifully. Joseph Gordon Levitt was probably the best of the bunch as he always seems to astound me with all his recent work. What can be said about DiCaprio that hasn't these past few years? Ellen Page always brings her ""A"" game and this time it is no different. Still, this movie is not going to appeal to everyone. This movie really makes you think, and unless you pay close attention you are surly to get lost. I would realistically give Inception 3 stars just because it doesn't appeal to a mass audience.

Not that the first viewing is any less intense or superb, but you notice much more the second time around. Inception may seem confusing but it in fact has a very simple premise: Attempt to steal vital information out of a person's subconscious, while dreaming. I have no idea why some people were perplexed about this film. If you pay attention from beginning to end, there should be no confusion and very little questions. It really isn't that hard to follow which surprised me. It may seem disoriented at first but as long as you keep watching and stay focused, you should have no problems. And the ending, though made to clearly aggrivate alot of people, was a no-brainer. And for people still disputing it, Christopher Nolan has come out and explained it and it is precisely what I originally thought happened.This film is a team effort and everyone does a phenomenal job. DiCaprio is spot-on, as usual but it is actually Joseph Gordon-Levitt who has some of the film's more exciting scenes. Inception is non-stop from the first scene and truly is one of those edge-of-your-seat type films. The editing is superb, the visual effects, cinematography and musical score is near perfection.

1305530,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B002ZG980U,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[5, 7]","Chris Nolan's ""Inception"" is like a giant puzzle and, as such, those that are interested in puzzles will probably enjoy this movie more than those who hate puzzles.Chris Nolan tackles some dark and stormy themes as part of his exceptional science fiction thriller ""Inception"" reminding us why he's one of the most talented and challenging mainstream film directors. Cobb (DeCaprio) leads a team involved in corporate espionage invading the minds of others taking their ideas for his employers. After one deal goes bad he gets an unusual offer from Saito (Watanabe); Saito wants Cobb and his team to plant an idea in the mind of Robert Fischer (Murphy) that will give Saito's company an advantage in the marketplace. Cobb knows the risks though as Inception can rarely be done and pulled off but he has his own motive pushing him to succeed; Cobb wants to be able to come home to America and see his children again after being on the run for years. ***Anchored by a strong, complex performance by DeCaprio and his supporting cast, ""Inception"" would seem doomed to failure simply because of the mulitple plot strands that weave around each other in the film. Nolan has accomplished a rare and unique feat (that he's managed to pull off before but not with such a complex narrative); he has created a summer blockbuster film with a brain and a heart that also has all the muscles of an action thriller. He may occasionally almost miss catching one of the many balls that he is juggling but the deft exposition of the film in the first half (and using the clever plot device of having Page play a novice to the team allowing us to learn at the same time about how the team operates) and action packed second half more than make up for any slip in the storytelling illusion that Nolan pulls off here. ***As a thriller ""Inception"" has more in common with ""Insomnia"", ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"" than it does with ""Batman Begins"", ""The Dark Knight"" or even Nolan's first film ""Following"". He takes all the lessons he's learned from those films and puts them to excellent use here crafting a film that constantly keeps the audience on its toes even in the conclusion of the film which leaves the resolution open to interpretation.As with all of Nolan's films, ""Inception"" looks marvelous with a distinct look to each ""layer"" of the film. It's pretty amazing what Nolan creates visually in collaboration with his director of photography considering that he is color blind. The Blu-ray receives an equally strong presentation here as it did in theaters. Colors pop with a distinct visual style for each level of the dream a challenge for both audiences and the production team. The transfer looks amazingly sharp with a crisp, detailed transfer that has very good depth. I didn't see any hint of edge enhancement nor did I see any other digital flaws aside from occasional digital noise that cropped up and that was relatively minor. ***The audio is equally impressive with a lossless audio transfer, nice use of the surround speakers to create the environment of the film.Watching the extras in the ""Extraction Mode"" is probably the best way to experience the extras included on the Blu-ray. The option allows one to watch the film while watching the various extras like Nolan who appears in a picture-in-picture special feature providing a nice companion piece to the film itself. I wouldn't watch it this way the very first time of course. You can watch the special features separately as well. There are long periods where the ""Extraction Mode"" doesn't have anything though so be prepared--you might find yourself drawn back into the movie only to be extracted again by having it pop up. Nolan doesn't explain the meaning (he leaves that up the individual viewer much as we interpret our own dreams) but does discuss the techniques about HOW he acheived many of the impressive effects of the movie (yes, Nolan uses CGI but he doesn't use it as his MAIN tool like a lot of directors might but as one of many preferring where possible to use onset physical effects where possible. ***We get one documentary on the making of the film that veer off into interesting, different and sometimes challenging directions much like the film itself. ""Dreams: Cinema of the Subconscious"" features actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt as host of a sometimes trippy examination of the subject bringing in a variety of folks from experts on dreaming to Nolan tying it back into the film itself. It runs just under 45 minutes. ***We also get a prequel that explains why Cobb is on the run with ""The Cobol Job"" running just under 15 minutes. This motion comic is a nice background piece for those who must know everything and can't take it on faith as to why Cobb was on the run from Cobol and how it forced him into Saito's waiting arms. ***BD-Live material is represented by Project Somnacin: The Confidential Files and we get a generous amount of pre-production artwork and promotional artwork. The extras are rounded out by the trailers and TV ads. All of these special features are presented in HD. -Whether or not you like ""Inception"" will depend on what you select a movie for--entertainment, a puzzle that challenges you, enlightenment and how you determine whether or not films like ""Inception"" play a role in all of that. Having said that, ""Inception"" will not be to everyone's taste. I like the movie quite a bit although I still feel it is flawed but even with those flaws it is better than the most of the summer swill that Hollywood usually has fed us in the past.Chris Nolan has often been accused (like Stanley Kubrick) of creating films that have no heart, no soul and that focuses on the intellect only but if you dig beneath the surface you will find that the film does have a heart and soul. Nolan manages to plant a smart, stylish thriller in theaters just as it looked as if we would be facing a limbo of dry, empty thrillers without no heart and no soul.",4,"""Inception"" - a giant puzzle

The dreamworld in Inception - which consisted of a series dreams within dreams scene's - was way over-the-top, leaving the movie watcher wondering at any particular moment during the movie, ""where was the scene was taking place: is it reality, or a dream, or a dream within a dream, or a dream within a dream within a dream?""  This movie ends up being nothing more than a poorly conceived twist of the Matrix, or more specifically, a ""Matrix Wannabe"" type movie -- it attempts to do with dreams what Matrix did with a virtual world created by computers, but fell sadly short.  I couldn't wait for the embedded dream events (dreams within-dreams) to unwind, and for the movie to be over.  Ironically, this movie puts forth the idea that five minutes in reality is about an hour in dream-time, and although this movie is approx. 2.5 hours long, it felt like well over 10-hrs to me .... and when done, it then left me wondering, whose dreams are they anyway?",1,Poorly Conceived Matrix Wannabe,1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,1238,"['Right', 'start', 'plot', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'follow', 'sub-plots', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'wife', 'were', 'equally', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'hard', 'follow/swallow', 'are', 'lot', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'lots', 'action', 'movie', 'devoid', 'believable', 'premise', 'dreamworld', 'Inception', 'consisted', 'series', 'dreams', 'dreams', 'scene', 'was', 'way', 'over-the-top', 'leaving', 'movie', 'watcher', 'wondering', 'particular', 'moment', 'movie', 'where', 'was', 'scene', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'reality', 'dream', 'dream', 'dream', 'dream', 'dream', 'dream', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'twist', 'Matrix', 'more', 'specifically', 'Matrix', 'Wannabe', 'type', 'movie', 'do', 'dreams', 'what', 'Matrix', 'did', 'virtual', 'world', 'created', 'computers', 'fell', 'sadly', 'short', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'embedded', 'dream', 'events', 'dreams', 'within-dreams', 'unwind', 'movie', 'be', 'Ironically', 'movie', 'forth', 'idea', 'five', 'minutes', 'reality', 'hour', 'dream-time', 'movie', 'approx', '2.5', 'hours', 'long', 'felt', 'like', 'well', '10-hrs', 'when', 'done', 'then', 'left', 'wondering', 'dreams', 'are', 'anyway']",N/A

It is not a horrible film, and director Nolan certainly deserves much credit for the inventive, creative and artistic elements.  However, my problem with the movie boils down to not enough special effects and too many scenes where the characters are standing around talking, not doing anything.  At over 2 & 1/2 hours long, there ARE several SFX scenes within Inception, but not nearly as many as the trailer leads you to believe (the street cafe and crumbling-cliff-skyscraper scenes previewed in the trailer are the two main ones), and in between SFX are long passages of talking.  The blurb description of ""Bond meets The Matrix"" has some relevance, as this film has several things in common with those two series.  For example, the ""snow fortress"" scene has seemingly endless shots of guys on snowmobiles shooting machines guns, a la Bond, and one of the ""Dream Team"" morphs into another character a la The Matrix.  (Just two examples of many similarities I could list.)  However, I didn't enjoy Inception nearly as much as either The Matrix movies at their best, or the best Bond flicks.  The strongest section of Inception was the final 15 minutes or so, where the multiple layers of dreams have to pull together for the good guys to survive, but even THAT was interrupted by a too-long, talky parting scene between the DiCaprio character and his wife, where they seem to be just repeating the same lines for about 10 minutes!  I once read a critic's guideline that you could tell how good a movie is by how many times you checked your watch.  The fewer times, the better.  (No watch-checking at all means a really engrossing move.)  I must have checked my watch at least a dozen times during Inception.  I also saw a few people get up and walk out of the movie, not returning.

It's an extremely entertaining film, if only because it keeps your brain on the edge of its seat (so to speak), but it doesn't stand up to close scrutiny.The principal difficulty is that, in wanting to make a film about dream states, and moving from his initial horror-film approach to one of straight drama, Christopher Nolan painted himself into a corner. The central dramatic conflict is between Cobb and his guilty memories of his dead wife, whom he accidentally influenced to commit suicide by convincing her of the unreality of their shared experience during an extended dream sequence they were trapped in. When she's finally convinced and ""commits suicide"" (along with Cobb) so they can exit, she's become /so/ thoroughly convinced of the ""unreality"" of everything, that she later kills herself in the real world.This points to the film's major problem -- Nolan has to /arbitrarily/ define those dream-state conditions and actions needed to make the story unfold as he wishes. The /drama/ is legitimate, but the mechanisms that ultimately incite it are tautologies, not extrapolations from what's known about dreaming -- and therefore unconvincing. (The script sometimes resembles Rick Berman dialog.)The worst of these problems involves lucid dreaming. Lucid dreamers (I'm one), can control most of their dreams. If someone shoots a gun, the bullet is unlikely to cause pain or damage. Yet Saito -- who knows he's in a dream -- is shot and bleeds. Similarly, the laws of physics cannot apply to someone during a lucid dream. We see the characters changing their environments simply by thinking about it -- but they don't walk through walls, teleport, or leap tall buildings in a single bound. If one impossible thing is possible (such as ""mentally materializing"" a potent weapon, when needed), then /every/ impossible thing should be possible. There can't be exceptions.I'm reminded of Gene Roddenberry reminding ""Star Trek"" writers that ""Marshall Dillon doesn't stop to explain how a gun works."" Christopher Nolan makes a heroic effort to minimize explanations, but ""Inception"" suffers from having to have almost everything explained to the viewer. The result is that much of ""Inception"" looks like a concoction.If you're wondering why the young woman is named Ariadne -- look it up. And the ""totem"" that Cobb carries is a ""teetotum"". Versions with numbers around the edge were used in games during the 19th century (possibly earlier).Still, ""Inception"" is entertaining (though I wouldn't call it ""fun""), and you're likely to watch it at least twice, if only to try to figure out the things that didn't make sense the first time around. Some of the special effects are mind-boggling. The supplemental material on a second disk is good, but doesn't give an extremely detailed description of the film's -- uh -- inception and development.",4,"""Mission: Impossible"" meets ""Alice in Wonderland""",1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,2991,"['thought', 'parts', 'II', 'III', 'Back', 'Future', 'were', 'hard', 'follow', 'did', ""n't"", 'wait', 'try', 'wrap', 'mind', 'Inception', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'only', 'brain', 'edge', 'seat', 'so', 'speak', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'close', 'scrutiny.The', 'principal', 'difficulty', 'wanting', 'make', 'film', 'dream', 'states', 'moving', 'initial', 'horror-film', 'approach', 'one', 'straight', 'drama', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'painted', 'corner', 'central', 'dramatic', 'conflict', 'Cobb', 'guilty', 'memories', 'dead', 'wife', 'whom', 'accidentally', 'influenced', 'commit', 'suicide', 'convincing', 'her', 'unreality', 'shared', 'experience', 'extended', 'dream', 'sequence', 'were', 'trapped', 'When', 'finally', 'convinced', 'commits', 'suicide', 'Cobb', 'can', 'exit', 'become', '/so/', 'thoroughly', 'convinced', 'unreality', 'everything', 'later', 'real', 'world.This', 'points', 'film', 'major', 'problem', 'Nolan', '/arbitrarily/', 'define', 'dream-state', 'conditions', 'actions', 'needed', 'make', 'story', 'unfold', '/drama/', 'legitimate', 'mechanisms', 'ultimately', 'incite', 'are', 'tautologies', 'not', 'extrapolations', 'what', 'known', 'dreaming', 'therefore', 'unconvincing', 'script', 'sometimes', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'dialog', 'worst', 'problems', 'lucid', 'dreaming', 'Lucid', 'dreamers', ""'m"", 'one', 'can', 'control', 'most', 'dreams', 'someone', 'shoots', 'gun', 'bullet', 'unlikely', 'cause', 'pain', 'damage', 'Saito', 'who', 'dream', 'shot', 'bleeds', 'Similarly', 'laws', 'physics', 'can', 'not', 'apply', 'someone', 'lucid', 'dream', 'see', 'characters', 'changing', 'environments', 'simply', 'thinking', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'walls', 'teleport', 'leap', 'tall', 'buildings', 'single', 'bound', 'one', 'impossible', 'thing', 'possible', 'such', 'mentally', 'materializing', 'potent', 'weapon', 'when', 'needed', 'then', '/every/', 'impossible', 'thing', 'should', 'be', 'possible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'exceptions.I', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'reminding', 'Star', 'Trek', 'writers', 'Marshall', 'Dillon', ""n't"", 'stop', 'explain', 'how', 'gun', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'heroic', 'effort', 'minimize', 'explanations', 'Inception', 'suffers', 'having', 'have', 'almost', 'everything', 'explained', 'viewer', 'result', 'much', 'Inception', 'concoction.If', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Ariadne', 'look', 'up', 'totem', 'Cobb', 'teetotum', 'Versions', 'numbers', 'edge', 'were', 'used', 'games', '19th', 'century', 'possibly', 'earlier', '.Still', 'Inception', 'entertaining', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'fun', ""'re"", 'likely', 'watch', 'least', 'twice', 'only', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'mind-boggling', 'supplemental', 'material', 'second', 'disk', 'good', ""n't"", 'give', 'extremely', 'detailed', 'description', 'film', 'uh', 'inception', 'development']",N/A

Start with the start power: Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role, Ellen Page playing the most mature part I've seen so far, an under-used Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe, and more.The action plays out in the dreams of the heir to an industrial empire. The goal: to get him to shut it down. Despite the obvious risk of degenerating into psychobabble, this stays true to its action theme, even when levels of reality start to layer like pastrami on rye. The victim, it turns out, has unexpected defenses. The attacker, it turns out, has unexpected weaknesses. And Page's character, Ariadne, takes on the role of her mythic namesake in unwinding the labyrinths of architecture and mind - not that this movie makes clear distinction.This could have become an effects-flick, as shown in Ariadne's intro to the dreamworld - possibly the most dramatic urban dreamscape sinceDark City. That setpiece really just served to show the effectmeister's general restraint, except on the few scenes where the enhancement really mattered. Instead, the movie relies on plot, action, and acting - a refreshing change from so many summer films of recent years.The multi-reality backdrop worked well, on the whole, but might become clearer on a second viewing.

1305545,A1QIL7847ET6HX,B002ZG980U,xxgrendelxx,"[8, 13]","Chris Nolan's ""Inception"" has been reviewed here endlessly so I'll just make a few points:It's good, and actually enjoyable on the second viewing - it's just too much of a headache trying to keep up on the first watch. It's not just the multiple layers of action involving the same characters on seperate planes that is tough, but somewhere I began losing my grip on why the characters were doing what they were doing.There are some things that require suspension of disbelief, like why Arthur would go back into a dream scenario with Cobb after a peice of Cobb's subconscience assaults him in the form of his dead wife by shooting Arthur in the leg within the dream. The very end was not actually disappointing as it was slightly annoying - kind of gimmicky and very Hollywood in terms of ""twist endings"". I suppose if Nolan hadn't edited it the way he did fans might have said he should have. I never really cared enough about the characters to have an opinion on that, DiCaprio is good but never really likeable.But the only thing I found more than a little disappointing is that for a film using dreams as a battleground there isn't the slightest shred of the surreal. Other top 500 reviewers claim this is on par with films by David Lynch  - not by the slightest stretch of the imagination can this opinion be sustained. The film is a straight out action flick, there isn't a trace of the surreal in it. Fans of Lynch will not be impressed; I know this because I have been a great fan of Lynch since ""Eraserhead"" was first released in 1977, as well as other surreal films like the great ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" and Bergman's ""Hour of the Wolf"". Flat out plot weirdness does not make a film surreal (many of Lynch's later films I also do not find surreal, so much as just weird), that is attained by a particularly sensitive kind of filmmaking.""Inception"" is a good solid action film with some weird sci-fi graphic elements that are reminiscent of ""Dark City"" (which is more surreal, by far), and though it places continuous demands on the viewer's attention span, it is well made.

Then, with each viewing, the film gets better and greater. Christopher Nolan does [it] again. Whereas he brought the ""real world"" to superhero movies with THE DARK KNIGHT he brings it to this Science-Fiction/Heist/Thriller/Corporate Espionage film through his cinematography, production, and script. As in all great ""heist""-type films, the key is a great ensemble cast. Leonardo DiCaprio is the lead, but he is backed with the likes of Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy and an actor who has grown so much since his days from the tv series THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (who looks uncannily like the late Heath Ledger, that, should Chris Nolan decide to do more Batman-sequels, should cast Levitt as ""The Joker"" for a re-match as the antagonist/villian). Also in the cast, Lukas Haas, Michael Caine, Pete Postlewaite, and good to see veteran Tom Berenger in the mix.  INCEPTION loosley resembles a forgotten 1984 Dennis Quaid thriller DREAMSCAPE with nods to TOTAL RECALL and THE MATRIX, with an ensemble-type atmosphere resembling the films of HEAT and RONIN. The pseudo-science, suspense, and special effects of dream worlds all blend well together for a great sci-fi thriller. Once again, DiCaprio turns in another intense performance (one of his best since THE DEPARTED), and Christopher Nolan is just an amazing filmmaker.",4,A Fine Reception for INCEPTION,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,1517,"['INCEPTION', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'first', 'viewing', 'few', 'screenings', 'order', 'figure', 'out', 'nuances', 'twists', 'clever', 'script', 'Then', 'viewing', 'film', 'better', 'greater', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', '[', ']', 'again', 'brought', 'real', 'world', 'superhero', 'movies', 'THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'Science-Fiction/Heist/Thriller/Corporate', 'Espionage', 'film', 'cinematography', 'production', 'script', 'great', 'heist', '-type', 'films', 'key', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'lead', 'backed', 'likes', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Dileep', 'Rao', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'actor', 'who', 'grown', 'so', 'much', 'days', 'tv', 'series', 'THIRD', 'ROCK', 'FROM', 'THE', 'SUN', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'uncannily', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'should', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'decide', 'do', 'more', 'Batman-sequels', 'should', 'cast', 'Levitt', 'Joker', 're-match', 'antagonist/villian', 'Also', 'cast', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Pete', 'Postlewaite', 'good', 'see', 'veteran', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'mix', 'INCEPTION', 'loosley', 'forgotten', '1984', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'thriller', 'DREAMSCAPE', 'nods', 'TOTAL', 'RECALL', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'ensemble-type', 'atmosphere', 'resembling', 'films', 'HEAT', 'RONIN', 'pseudo-science', 'suspense', 'special', 'effects', 'dream', 'worlds', 'blend', 'well', 'together', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'Once', 'again', 'DiCaprio', 'intense', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'THE', 'DEPARTED', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'just', 'amazing', 'filmmaker']",N/A

Inception keeps a balance of good acting and cgi. Both the acting and the cgi steal the show. If you are really into the art of filmaking, Inception is not something you want to miss out on. As I explain Inception to you, and what it expresses and how it may appeal to your senses. SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!STORYThis movie is sort of an IQ test. Inception's story may be the most complex story you'll ever have to go on. Many things are thrown at you. You will be trying to focus on one thing, and you'll think you understand everything, well no. There is so many things you have to look into when watching this film, and trying to understand its flow. Former dream architect Dominic ""Dom"" Cobb and business partner Arthur perform corporate espionage using an experimental military-developed machine to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract information while dreaming, their latest target being Japanese businessman Saito. Tiered dream within a dream strategies are used and dreamers awaken by a ""kick"" such as falling or by dying in the dream. If the dreamer is the one who awakens, the dream ""collapses"". Each extractor carries a totem, a small object the behavior of which is only predictable to its owner, used to determine whether a dreamer is in someone else's dream. Cobb's totem is a spinning top that perpetually spins in the dream state. The extraction fails due to Mallorie ""Mal"" Cobb, Cobb's deceased wife, whose memory projection sabotages the mission. Saito reveals, after Cobb's and Arthur's associate sells them out, that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of inception: implanting an idea into a person's subconscious while they sleep.Saito wishes to break up the energy conglomerate of his ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, by planting the idea in his son and heir Robert Fischer to disintegrate his father's company. Should Cobb succeed, Saito would use his influence to clear a murder charge against Cobb, so he can return to the United States and his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts the powerful sedative for a stable dream within a dream strategy; Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes; and Arthur. Saito accompanies so that he knows whether or not Cobb and his team succeeded.When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney and his body is flown back to Los Angeles, the team share the flight with Robert Fischer and Cobb sedates him, bringing him into the shared dream. At each stage, the member of the team generating the dream stays behind to initiate the ""kick"", while the other members sleep within the dream to travel a level deeper. In the first level, Yusuf's rainy downtown dream, the team abducts Fischer. However Fischer's trained subconscious projections attack and severely wound Saito. Eames temporarily takes the appearance of Fischer's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Fischer reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives the team in a van as they are sedated into Arthur's dream, a hotel, where the team recruit Fischer, convincing him his kidnapping was orchestrated by Browning. In the third dream level, a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames, Fischer is told they are in Browning's subconscious, but they are really going deeper into Fischer's. Yusuf, under assault by trained projections, initiates his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, sending Arthur's dream world into zero-gravity and causing an avalanche in Eames' dream. Arthur improvises a new kick using an elevator that will be synchronized with the van hitting the water, while the team in Eames' dream races to finish the job before the new round of kicks.Due to the effects of heavy sedation and multi-layered dreaming, death during this mission will result in entering Limbo, dream space of unknown content where the dreamer could be trapped. Elapsed time in each dream level is roughly twenty times greater than in the level above it; in Limbo, the deepest level of all, 24 hours of outer-world time would be experienced as about half a century. Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he spent ""fifty years"" with Mal in Limbo constructing a world from their shared memories whilst seemingly growing old together. After returning to the waking world, Mal remained convinced she was still dreaming and committed suicide, trying to persuade Cobb to do so by retroactively incriminating him in her death. He fled the U.S. and left his children behind, ostensibly in the care of his father-in-law.Saito succumbs to his wounds, and Cobb's projection of Mal sabotages the plan by killing Fischer, sending them both into Limbo. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to find Fischer and Saito, while Eames remains on his dream level to set up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives. Cobb confronts his projection of Mal, who tries convincing him to stay in Limbo. Cobb refuses and confesses that he was responsible for Mal's suicide: having convinced her to leave Limbo by using inception to plant the idea in her mind that the world they had been living in for fifty years was not real, and hence the need to kill themselves in order to return to the real world, once back in the real world she continued to believe dying would wake her. Mal attacks Cobb but Ariadne shoots her. Through his confession, Cobb attains catharsis and chooses to remain in Limbo to search for Saito. Ariadne pushes Fischer off a balcony, bringing him back up to the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: that his father wishes him to be his ""own man"", and that splitting up the conglomerate might not be a radical notion.All of the team members except Cobb and Saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony in Limbo, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team's sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in Yusuf's dream hits the water. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito and the two remember their arrangement, presumably killing themselves and awakening to outer-world reality on the airplane. Saito honors the arrangement and Cobb passes through U.S. customs once the plane lands in Los Angeles. Before reuniting with his children, Cobb tests reality with his spinning top, but he turns away to greet them before observing the results. As I stated earlier, this is a lot to go on, so you can't miss a single second of this film, or you will not understand its climax. Inception's story is something you won't understand the first time around.ACTINGWhy Dicaprio hasn't won an oscar for this fantastic performance? I will never understand. I mean how much better is he supposed to be? There aren't many actors out there like him these days who can become the character by putting so much expression and heart into his role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes the film even better. He, as an actor, supports leo's character in every way, he gives off a believable performance in support of leo. Ellen page is a fresh new actress who does her best to capture the role as the film's second protagonist. Tom hardy, I say this a lot but, Tom hardy is a great character actor who chooses the right roles. If you are looking for a persona film, Inception has multiple persona performances by each character, and is most desirable! Michael caine, same old same old.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTThere is so much character development in the entire film. Good thing the film is long enough for you to understand the characters in the film, and what their purpose is. I can't stress this enough, PAY ATTENTION TO THE FILM!SPECIAL EFFECTS AND SETSThe cgi is one of the main aspaects that captures this film. The sets and effects are visual striking. I would imagine this film making a beautiful blu ray, unfortunatley I didn't purchase the blu ray, but the dvd. It feels as if you are in this illusionary world (No pun intended). It doesn't look fake at all, not one little bit. Of course christopher nolan had to hire the best cgi workers in the world.DVD QUALITYI purchased the dvd at a small store. I note that the dvd says ""Inception"", then it says ""Origine"". I am not sure what origine means or what language that is, but if someone could tell me I would appreciate that. Overall, the picture quality of this dvd is great, very clear, good sound, no fuss or sound issues. The film is presented in widescreen.SPECIAL FEATURES-The inception of inception- Christopher nolan shapes his unusual concept for the movie.-The japanese castle: The dream is collapsing- Creating and destroying the castle sets.-Constructing paradoxical architecture- Designing the staircase to nowhere.The freight train- Constructing the street faring express train.LANGUAGESThe languages are in english, french, and in espanol, dolby surround 5.1. Also has english subtitles for hearing impaired.SOUNDTRACKThe music is really nice in this film, it has an epic sound. A great orchestra was hired to make this film. Love the trailer music, ending music, I'm gonna see if I can find the tracks on cd anywhere.FINAL WORDInception is a film that is testing your IQ. Therefore, this film may not be for everyone if you don't like to think that hard when watching a film. However, you will be spending almost 3 hours of your time contemplating what is going on in terms of events, but in the end, it all leaves you with an inscrutable climax that will begin to make piece together all that has happened. Many people had questions in the end, because the film is like rocket science, but it's so exciting. Inception is one of those films you have to watch over and over again. Christopher nolan's vision of filmaking is pure solid geniusness! You can't miss out on a film like this, and if you have any unanswered questions, simply dig deep into the film's presence, find what you found passionate about the film, and slowly piece everything together. I will be reviewing the departed soon, so stay in touch.",5,It's so complex it's cool!,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,10159,"['Christopher', 'nolan', 'foreshadowing', 'play', 'viewers', 'expectations',

But is it a classic?  Not quite, due to some ""can't quite put my finger on it"" lack of overall execution.For a basic plot summary, ""Inception"" deals in the world of shared dreams, in which individuals (while asleep) can enter the dream of another and insert/extract information.  When an ""inception"" team (led by Leonardo DiCaprio) is put together for an especially difficult assignment, they must go deeper into the mark's head than ever before.In terms of grandiose ideas, ""Inception"" is truly a mind-boggling concept that will intrigue you right from the get-go.  The visual effects are spectacular and innovative, while the whole scope of the movie is often staggering.Here's the ""problem"", though: This isn't a movie that will stick with me for any prolonged period of time (and thus makes me unable to give it five stars).  The plot execution and character development just left a little too much to be desired in sacrifice to the ideas.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but (besides the incredible science fiction"", ""Inception"" just isn't an all-time classic.Thus, while an entertaining watch, I rank ""Inception"" well below ""The Matrix"" (very similar concepts) and about on par with ""Shutter Island"".

Christopher Nolan doesn't really make films though, he makes rollercoasters. Inception isn't something where anything is learned or truly examined as much as it is a brain twister. It doesn't engage the heart and mind and soul in any way very mature as much as it , more often than not, dazzles every human's reptilian hindbrain and excites it with shiny fancy gimmicks and contrived chases and little riddles to keep you busy while he pulls another trick out of his sleeve to make sure the next flash blinds you enough to not notice the lack of weight. While it was a pretty good rollercoaster or lateral thinking puzzle or at times both at once, as a film it was very little to say much about. The single emotional, as opposed to intellectual, string it tries to pull is pulled so sappily and so much like some kind of soap opera it got a bit sickening and tiring after a while (while it still ""kept you guessing""). Better than The Dark Knight and Memento , not as good as Following and The Prestige.On a brighter note it did in a way rekindle a certain interest in videogames and architecture and installation art (and all three together). The music and sound design were quite nice and added effective and affecting accents to many parts; many of Zimmer's eerie drones helped create a dreamy vertigo effect. The acting was competent and the overall idea is smart even if emotionless and empty on any deeper level. The special effects were done quite well with some very striking things-- the spinning hallway being the simplest but also most interesting-- and I like that Nolan, as much as possible, wanted to avoid computer effects so that things could be done just in-camera with tricks that way, which ultimately look more ""real"" than just about any computer graphics can even today. Even if Nolan is nothing but a Juggler, he's one of the better jugglers.",2,"Smart and exciting, but heartless and meaningless",1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,1993,"['time', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'film', 'released', 'hailed', 'en', 'masse', 'be', 'second', 'coming', 'Christ', 'form', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'films', 'rollercoasters', 'Inception', ""n't"", 'something', 'where', 'anything', 'learned', 'truly', 'examined', 'as', 'much', 'brain', 'twister', ""n't"", 'engage', 'heart', 'mind', 'soul', 'way', 'very', 'mature', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'dazzles', 'human', 'reptilian', 'hindbrain', 'shiny', 'fancy', 'gimmicks', 'contrived', 'chases', 'little', 'riddles', 'keep', 'busy', 'trick', 'sleeve', 'make', 'sure', 'next', 'flash', 'blinds', 'enough', 'not', 'notice', 'lack', 'weight', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'rollercoaster', 'lateral', 'thinking', 'puzzle', 'times', 'once', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'say', 'much', 'single', 'emotional', 'opposed', 'intellectual', 'string', 'pull', 'pulled', 'so', 'sappily', 'so', 'much', 'kind', 'soap', 'opera', 'got', 'bit', 'sickening', 'tiring', 'while', 'still', 'kept', 'guessing', 'Better', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Memento', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Following', 'Prestige.On', 'brighter', 'note', 'did', 'way', 'certain', 'interest', 'videogames', 'architecture', 'installation', 'art', 'three', 'together', 'music', 'sound', 'design', 'were', 'quite', 'nice', 'added', 'effective', 'affecting', 'accents', 'many', 'parts', 'many', 'Zimmer', 'eerie', 'drones', 'helped', 'create', 'dreamy', 'vertigo', 'effect', 'acting', 'was', 'competent', 'overall', 'idea', 'smart', 'even', 'emotionless', 'empty', 'deeper', 'level', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'very', 'striking', 'things', 'spinning', 'hallway', 'being', 'simplest', 'also', 'most', 'interesting', 'like', 'Nolan', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'computer', 'effects', 'so', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'just', 'in-camera', 'tricks', 'way', 'ultimately', 'look', 'more', 'real', 'just', 'computer', 'graphics', 'can', 'even', 'today', 'Even', 'Nolan', 'nothing', 'Juggler', 'one', 'better', 'jugglers']",N/A
