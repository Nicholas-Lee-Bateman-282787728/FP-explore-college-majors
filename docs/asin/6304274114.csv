410670,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6304274114,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 10/10Rate: 810/10: Bullet makes for an interesting film and is certainly one of the better Mickey Rourke pictures. Julien Temple, responsible for his somewhat gritty and offbeat work in The Filth and the Fury which was the biography of the punk band The Sex Pistols, takes a lot of credit for bringing uber cultish feel through Bullet. That is what caused me to respect the film more rather than dismiss it as a ghetto wannabe flick like Belly was. The performances by the cast were pretty good if kooky. Among the cast, the stand-outs were Ted Levine (who had a popular role as Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs) and John Enos III (he was quite amusing, reminding me of Steven Bauer's work in Scarface). I wish that Adrien Brody was completely cut out of the film; I just hate his irritating presence and even more so after his horribly overrated winning performance in The Pianist (somebody take his Oscar away please). Back to Mickey, I thought he was really great and looked awesome in his ghetto outfit. The look completes him, but his character was bit bizarre for me; I expected just more out of him. However, it was probably the best performance of the 90's out of him. What else I liked about the film is that it's hard and cold, nothing sugar-coated. It's a good portrayal of realism, no matter how good the characters look. All in all, Bullet is a well-made picture that certainly got my attention; to discredit the film just because it looks stupid and trash would be an injustice.",4,One of Mickey's Finest Hour.,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,1508,"['Viewed', '10/10Rate', '810/10', 'Bullet', 'interesting', 'film', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'pictures', 'Julien', 'Temple', 'responsible', 'somewhat', 'gritty', 'offbeat', 'work', 'Filth', 'Fury', 'was', 'biography', 'punk', 'band', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'lot', 'credit', 'bringing', 'uber', 'cultish', 'feel', 'Bullet', 'what', 'caused', 'respect', 'film', 'more', 'rather', 'dismiss', 'ghetto', 'wannabe', 'flick', 'Belly', 'was', 'performances', 'cast', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'kooky', 'cast', 'stand-outs', 'were', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'who', 'had', 'popular', 'role', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'John', 'Enos', 'III', 'was', 'quite', 'amusing', 'reminding', 'Steven', 'Bauer', 'work', 'Scarface', 'wish', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'was', 'completely', 'cut', 'film', 'just', 'hate', 'irritating', 'presence', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'horribly', 'overrated', 'winning', 'performance', 'Pianist', 'somebody', 'take', 'Oscar', 'away', 'please', 'Back', 'Mickey', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'looked', 'awesome', 'ghetto', 'outfit', 'look', 'character', 'was', 'bit', 'bizarre', 'expected', 'just', 'more', 'However', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', '90', 'What', 'else', 'liked', 'film', 'hard', 'cold', 'nothing', 'sugar-coated', 'good', 'portrayal', 'realism', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'characters', 'look', 'Bullet', 'well-made', 'picture', 'certainly', 'got', 'attention', 'discredit', 'film', 'just', 'stupid', 'trash', 'would', 'be', 'injustice']",Bullet VHS

First of all, you'll never see anything like this again, Tupac: gone, Mickey: just different these days, and Wahlberg played ""Big Balls"". You can tell, that things just came together to make an incredible film. Little details of realism and humble, masterful performances. For example, even character interaction with ""Big Balls"" is given careful attention. Bullet says in a caring way ""how you doin Big Balls?"". He treats Balls with respect because Balls says exactly what he feels (and is not afraid - hence ""Big Balls""). Even after Balls says ""none of this ...happened until this crazy ... showed up"" Bullet is calm and doesn't take it as a personal attack, he just sits there and let's them yell it out. Bullet is afraid of no-one. Neither is ""Tank"" (Tupac), and ""men love to hate"". So the story goes. It's not just drama, (I hate drama) it's priceless nuance and good filmaking. If you enjoyed New Jack, Menace2 or Sugar Hill, Bullet will blow em away. You'll be touched, but don't let that stop you. Don't miss Bullet.As for the storyline: Bullet (Mickey Rourke) gets out of prison and the very same day, exacts revenge on Tank (Tupac) by robbing some of his smack customers and stabbing one his dealers in the eye. From there, we go through family and interpersonal dysfunctions of Bullet and his foemen. There is more tragedy than optimism, so be warned.

410676,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6304274114,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 1]","""Bullet"" has such extraordinary acting we can only wish that someone had chosen a more upbeat story. There is little comfort to be found in the story of the 3 sons of  Brooklyn Jewish family - one is a ex-con druggie hell bent on self destruction, another is an ex-veteran reduced to paranoid schizophrenia, and the third is an ""artist"" who paints on bathroom walls and abandoned buildings.Mickey Rourke (1952) plays the ex-con. Rourke is best known to younger viewers as the Oscar nominated star of ""The Wrestler"" (2008) for which he won a BAFTA. Older viewers will remember him for ""Body Heat"" (1981), ""Diner"" (1982), and ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"" (1984). Personally I liked him best in ""Angel Heart"" (1987). Rourke is probably one of the most talented actors around, and this is one of his strongest performances.Adrian Brody (1973) plays the artist. For his role in ""The Pianist"" (2002) Brody won an Oscar and a Cesar and was nominated for a Golden Globe. At 29 he was the youngest person to ever win the Best Actor Oscar.Ted Levine (1957) plays the ex-vet and his performance is so good he steals every scene, which is quite an accomplishment given the cast. Levine is best known from his role as ""Buffalo Bill"" in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991).Tupac Shakur (1971-96) plays a local hood who has a long history of conflict with Rourke. Shakur was a world famous MC and the highest selling rap/hip hop artist. In real life, Shakur and Brody were good friends. This was Shakur's last film and he was killed within a few weeks of completing the film.The film is directed by Julien Temple (1953) who works primarily as a documentary director and is probably best known for ""Earth Girls are Easy"" (1988). He manages to keep the action moving so that you never have a chance to sit back and relax.If you like really good acting, this film is for you if you can stand to sit through the grim story.",4,Great performances in a grim film,1304553600,"05 5, 2011",2011,1905,"['Bullet', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'can', 'only', 'wish', 'someone', 'had', 'chosen', 'more', 'upbeat', 'story', 'little', 'comfort', 'be', 'found', 'story', '3', 'sons', 'Brooklyn', 'Jewish', 'family', 'one', 'ex-con', 'druggie', 'hell', 'bent', 'self', 'destruction', 'ex-veteran', 'reduced', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'third', 'artist', 'who', 'paints', 'bathroom', 'walls', 'abandoned', 'buildings.Mickey', 'Rourke', '1952', 'ex-con', 'Rourke', 'best', 'known', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'star', 'Wrestler', '2008', 'won', 'BAFTA', 'Older', 'viewers', 'will', 'remember', 'Body', 'Heat', '1981', 'Diner', '1982', 'Pope', 'Greenwich', 'Village', '1984', 'Personally', 'liked', 'best', 'Angel', 'Heart', '1987', 'Rourke', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'one', 'strongest', 'performances.Adrian', 'Brody', '1973', 'artist', 'role', 'Pianist', '2002', 'Brody', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Cesar', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', '29', 'was', 'youngest', 'person', 'ever', 'win', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar.Ted', 'Levine', '1957', 'ex-vet', 'performance', 'so', 'good', 'scene', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'given', 'cast', 'Levine', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'Silence', 'Lambs', '1991', '.Tupac', 'Shakur', '1971-96', 'local', 'hood', 'who', 'long', 'history', 'conflict', 'Rourke', 'Shakur', 'was', 'world', 'famous', 'MC', 'highest', 'selling', 'rap/hip', 'hop', 'artist', 'real', 'life', 'Shakur', 'Brody', 'were', 'good', 'friends', 'was', 'Shakur', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'killed', 'few', 'weeks', 'completing', 'film.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Julien', 'Temple', '1953', 'who', 'primarily', 'documentary', 'director', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'Earth', 'Girls', 'are', 'Easy', '1988', 'keep', 'action', 'moving', 'so', 'never', 'have', 'chance', 'sit', 'back', 'relax.If', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'film', 'can', 'stand', 'sit', 'grim', 'story']",Bullet VHS

410678,A2T0XBQM7N923Y,6304274114,Fady Ghaly,"[0, 0]","Bullet is a stylish mix of violence and vindictiveness. It fiercely voyages into the dark underworld of two men who share a bitter hatred and grudging respect. It elucidates of just what it takes to survive on the streets of reckless drugs and vengeful gangs with a penetrating intelligence. And while it may appear as being your average gangster film with nothing more to it than a number one soundtrack, pessimistic dialogue and pistol-packing thugs whose only pursuit in life's to blow everyone else's brains away for virtually no reason at all but for the sheer appeal it has to many viewers out there-it isn't. It focuses more upon moral values and the consequences that are made between you and loved ones if deciding to be so careless as to not altering such a perilous lifestyle that's good for nothing but taking away your dignity, everything that you believe in and the person that you once were in whom others so deeply treasured. As it converts you to another one of the filth: a degrading individual in society who seeks out for nothing but the rush of getting high...the rush to dissolve away such tainted afflictions that are of living.The entire cast was stupendous, for they delivered some of the most powerful and hypnotic performances I have ever seen. I use the term ""hypnotic"" most notably because of Mickey Rourke's performance that make clear of just how talented he really is throughout depictions of various drug-induced hazes and other scenes that are just as moving. He perfectly essays the smooth roll of an easygoing drug-attic without any values or care for himself or life in general, and who clearly knows where his future is heading. When you realize that he was once a joyous youngster known to win plenty of metals for his talent in baseball, a sport that was evidently a factor to a bright future as perhaps the next Babe Ruth, it becomes clear that shooting up heroin is the only solution for this helpless man's afflictions, and you really feel for him; you share his anguish.Though such a gloomy and moody picture ultimately has you aware that a ""delightful"" conclusion is something it won't exactly offer as Butch's probabilities of making it out alive began to slender, the director has him use all the good that is left in him, all that he has become good for, to show to others the life they'll be living if ever deciding to approach what made him the man that he is today. (For instance, though he did not necessarily get along with these two specific students fresh out of high school and new to the hood, rather than giving them the pleasure of getting physical near the end when they had one last encounter with him inside some nightclub, he rolls up his sleeves and, while he shows them of how overpowering things you pick up from the streets are, sternly looks at them with eyes so swollen you would presume he was through hell and back, and it becomes clear of the point that he is trying to make as he tells them that if they do choose to follow in his footsteps, they aren't ever going to make it out alive.) The director doesn't glamorize drugs. Instead, he makes his point and he makes his point well by showing us how destructive they are in this realistic melodrama, and Butch was someone in whom he used to accomplish that goal. Like a chain smoker that now winds up drawing smoke in and out from the hole in his throat which had to be surgically made because his lungs can take no more, you can't help but to recoil away, as those two students found themselves doing; there was real impact there. And while it may have seemed like the director had a weak part as to filling us in to why Butch was sentenced for eight years in prison, he ultimately does, and once you find out, you develop a whole new kind of esteem for Butch and the film.",4,Fady Ghaly's reviews,1004313600,"10 29, 2001",2001,3797,"['Bullet', 'stylish', 'mix', 'violence', 'vindictiveness', 'fiercely', 'dark', 'underworld', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'share', 'bitter', 'hatred', 'grudging', 'respect', 'just', 'what', 'survive', 'streets', 'reckless', 'drugs', 'vengeful', 'gangs', 'penetrating', 'intelligence', 'may', 'appear', 'being', 'average', 'gangster', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'number', 'one', 'soundtrack', 'pessimistic', 'dialogue', 'pistol-packing', 'thugs', 'only', 'pursuit', 'life', 'blow', 'everyone', 'else', 'brains', 'away', 'virtually', 'reason', 'sheer', 'appeal', 'many', 'viewers', 'out', 'there-it', ""n't"", 'more', 'upon', 'moral', 'values', 'consequences', 'are', 'made', 'loved', 'ones', 'deciding', 'be', 'so', 'careless', 'not', 'altering', 'such', 'perilous', 'lifestyle', 'good', 'nothing', 'taking', 'away', 'dignity', 'everything', 'believe', 'person', 'once', 'were', 'whom', 'others', 'so', 'deeply', 'treasured', 'one', 'filth', 'degrading', 'individual', 'society', 'who', 'out', 'nothing', 'rush', 'getting', 'high', 'rush', 'dissolve', 'away', 'such', 'tainted', 'afflictions', 'are', 'living.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'stupendous', 'delivered', 'most', 'powerful', 'hypnotic', 'performances', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'use', 'term', 'hypnotic', 'most', 'notably', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'make', 'clear', 'just', 'how', 'talented', 'really', 'depictions', 'various', 'drug-induced', 'hazes', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'moving', 'perfectly', 'smooth', 'roll', 'easygoing', 'drug-attic', 'values', 'care', 'life', 'general', 'who', 'clearly', 'where', 'future', 'heading', 'When', 'realize', 'was', 'once', 'joyous', 'youngster', 'known', 'win', 'plenty', 'metals', 'talent', 'baseball', 'sport', 'was', 'evidently', 'factor', 'bright', 'future', 'perhaps', 'next', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'clear', 'shooting', 'up', 'heroin', 'only', 'solution', 'helpless', 'man', 'afflictions', 'really', 'feel', 'share', 'anguish.Though', 'gloomy', 'moody', 'picture', 'ultimately', 'aware', 'delightful', 'conclusion', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'offer', 'Butch', 'probabilities', 'making', 'out', 'alive', 'began', 'slender', 'director', 'use', 'good', 'left', 'become', 'good', 'show', 'others', 'life', ""'ll"", 'be', 'living', 'ever', 'deciding', 'approach', 'what', 'made', 'man', 'today', 'instance', 'did', 'not', 'necessarily', 'get', 'two', 'specific', 'students', 'fresh', 'high', 'school', 'new', 'hood', 'rather', 'giving', 'pleasure', 'getting', 'physical', 'end', 'when', 'had', 'one', 'last', 'encounter', 'inside', 'nightclub', 'up', 'sleeves', 'how', 'overpowering', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'streets', 'are', 'sternly', 'eyes', 'so', 'swollen', 'would', 'presume', 'was', 'hell', 'back', 'clear', 'point', 'trying', 'make', 'do', 'choose', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'are', ""n't"", 'ever', 'going', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'director', ""n't"", 'glamorize', 'drugs', 'Instead', 'point', 'point', 'well', 'showing', 'how', 'destructive', 'are', 'realistic', 'melodrama', 'Butch', 'was', 'someone', 'whom', 'used', 'accomplish', 'goal', 'chain', 'smoker', 'now', 'up', 'drawing', 'smoke', 'hole', 'throat', 'had', 'be', 'surgically', 'made', 'lungs', 'can', 'take', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'recoil', 'away', 'two', 'students', 'found', 'doing', 'was', 'real', 'impact', 'there', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'director', 'had', 'weak', 'part', 'filling', 'why', 'Butch', 'was', 'sentenced', 'eight', 'years', 'prison', 'ultimately', 'once', 'find', 'out', 'develop', 'whole', 'new', 'kind', 'esteem', 'Butch', 'film']",Bullet VHS

It was reminding my of the environment I was living when I was only in sixth grade at the time when the east and west coast war was unfolding. The story of the movies main character ""Bullet"" is something I can relate to emotionaly.""MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD""Butch ""Bullet"" Stein (Mickey Rourke)gets released from prison after a eight year sentince he took for a close ally from the neighborhood and hooks up with his little brother Ruby who is a highly talented piantist,and childhood friend Lestor who is a big male gigalo. When Bullets Prison nemmenis Tank (2pac) who wants revenge one him for shanking his eye out when they in prison finds his back in the neighborhood all hell breaks loose. Bullets back to shooting smack and has a death wish. Bullet and his  thugish homeboy paddy are at war with Tank and his crew and are in a power struggle that they can resolve by an ultimate sacrifice.BULLET is one of the most underrated films on thug life ever made and nerver made the theaters. It has a handful of supporting actors in including Bullets schizofrinic vietnam vet brother Louis who defenitly stills the show and 2Pac who has the best lines throuhout the movie. One of Mickey Rourke's best performances since YEAR OF THE DRAGON and is cooler than cool.The DVD has a R-rated and UNRATED versions of the movie. The unrated has extended footage of a guy getting stabed in the eye with blood swirting out and a extra footage of a sex at a nightclub. If your from a prilvidged background you wouldn't understand the moral values of the story being told.

Looking at it again this evening on the IFC channel on cable, the one thing that stood out now as compared to watching it back then was the stars who were in this movie and how they've blown up since.  We all know PAC was on the verge of blowing up movie wise before his death.  Mickey was always Mickey and he kind of crashed and burned after this one but now has risen like a Phoenix back on the scene as an Oscar contender in ""The Wrestler"".  Oscar worthy?  Talented as hell yes, but Oscar and Mickey Rourke in the same sentence who'd a thought it.  Adrien Brody has blown up nicely since as well winning an Oscar in the ""Pianist"" in 2002.  Who can forget Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill in the original Silence of the Lambs and his appearance in the crime thriller Heat.  Donnie Wahlberg as ""Big Balls"" in this movie and of course Michael K. Williams aka Omar Little from HBO's The Wire as Hi Top.  Watching this movie again after all these years, with a little better directing and scriptwriting and with this talented cast, this film had potential to be a classic urban flick.
