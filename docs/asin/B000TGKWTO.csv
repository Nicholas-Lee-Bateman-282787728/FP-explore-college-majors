1090009,A2733E5FQFAUKR,B000TGKWTO,Rick  Henry,"[10, 14]","Some of these films are really surprising treats -- that I missed long ago, and was glad to get to view.  I was particularly impressed with ""The Last Man on Earth,"" ""Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride,"" ""Circus of Fear,"" and ""Horror Express.""  (""Circus"" and ""The Bat"" probably being the most grounded in a more realistic reality, whereas the others do roil in the horror genre with both feet.)  I particularly enjoyed Christopher Lee in his varied roles; he appears to have been a much better actor than ever previously noted.  Vincent Price has his place, too... but for my money, he gets a bit tedious when overlong, and overdone.The problem here, however, is neither the actors or the film genres.  It is the company which packaged them -- which should be penalized for presenting such a poorly ""digitally re-mastered"" product; which thus makes one wonder if perhaps their dvd player is losing its touch, or possibly a trip to the eye doctor may be necessary for a change of glasses.  It is a tragedy to have come across such a rather nice selection of films, that are too much on the bleary/blurry side to fully enjoy.  And only the most determined of fans will be willing to wade through to the bitter end.  For the price, one could say, what do you expect?  But for my ethics, no one should be in business to give you an inferior product, regardless of the price tag.  If you are selling Rolex's for five cents, they should be as good as the ones selling for five thousand.  If it isn't worth the buying, it isn't worth the selling.  But then, there are rip-offs, and there are rip-offs.  If the company likes their reputation in the gutter, that's their business.  They put it there.  And I'm not able to clean it up....",3,"Do I need a change of glasses, or a new tv set?",1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,1728,"['films', 'are', 'really', 'surprising', 'treats', 'missed', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'glad', 'get', 'view', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'Vampire', 'Bride', 'Circus', 'Fear', 'Horror', 'Express', 'Circus', 'Bat', 'probably', 'being', 'most', 'grounded', 'more', 'realistic', 'reality', 'others', 'do', 'roil', 'horror', 'genre', 'feet', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'varied', 'roles', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'ever', 'previously', 'noted', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'place', 'too', 'money', 'bit', 'tedious', 'when', 'overlong', 'overdone.The', 'problem', 'here', 'however', 'actors', 'film', 'genres', 'company', 'packaged', 'should', 'be', 'penalized', 'presenting', 'poorly', 'digitally', 're-mastered', 'product', 'thus', 'one', 'wonder', 'perhaps', 'dvd', 'player', 'losing', 'touch', 'possibly', 'trip', 'eye', 'doctor', 'may', 'be', 'necessary', 'change', 'glasses', 'tragedy', 'have', 'come', 'rather', 'nice', 'selection', 'films', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'bleary/blurry', 'side', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'only', 'most', 'determined', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'willing', 'wade', 'bitter', 'end', 'price', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'ethics', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'business', 'give', 'inferior', 'product', 'regardless', 'price', 'tag', 'are', 'selling', 'Rolex', 'five', 'cents', 'should', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'ones', 'selling', 'five', 'thousand', ""n't"", 'worth', 'buying', ""n't"", 'worth', 'selling', 'then', 'are', 'rip-offs', 'are', 'rip-offs', 'company', 'reputation', 'gutter', 'business', 'put', 'there', ""'m"", 'not', 'able', 'clean', 'up']",N/A

1090011,AE3OAGMSGIIUI,B000TGKWTO,Travis,"[4, 5]","As other reviewers have noted, the problem here isn't with the films themselves, but with the audio/visual quality of the presentation.  The films on the Vincent Price disc aren't bad, but the Christopher Lee disc looks like someone video taped a TV broadcast of the movies.  ""Horror Express"" and ""Circus of Fear"" are both terrible; scenes set in the dark are overexposed, grainy and look brown.  ""Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride"" fares better, but it's presented in a non-anamorphic widescreen presentation.  It's also worth noting that this film in particular is from the Hammer ""Dracula"" series, and while you don't need to see the previous films to follow the events of this film, you're not getting a one-off production, either.""House on Haunted Hill"" - ****""The Last Man on Earth"" - ***""The Bat"" - ****""Horror Express"" - ****""Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride"" - **""Circus of Fear"" - ***A/V quality - *",3,"Films: ***, DVD: *",1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,914,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'problem', 'here', ""n't"", 'films', 'audio/visual', 'quality', 'presentation', 'films', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'disc', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'someone', 'video', 'taped', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'movies', 'Horror', 'Express', 'Circus', 'Fear', 'are', 'terrible', 'scenes', 'set', 'dark', 'are', 'overexposed', 'grainy', 'look', 'brown', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'Vampire', 'Bride', 'better', 'presented', 'non-anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'film', 'particular', 'Hammer', 'Dracula', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'previous', 'films', 'follow', 'events', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', 'one-off', 'production', 'either', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', '****', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', '***', 'Bat', '****', 'Horror', 'Express', '****', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'Vampire', 'Bride', '**', 'Circus', 'Fear', '***A/V', 'quality', '*']",N/A
