1114219,A38XTOID4VG01S,B000XJ5TOU,,"[0, 5]","This is the very definition of a mediocre film--it's a mix of solid performances (e.g., Jon Voigt, who seems to have cornered the market on cold, unflinching, ruthless elder statesmen/scary old white dude roles), interesting depictions of little-known historical events (like the Mountain Meadows massacre perpetrated by the Mormons), a misguided Romeo-and-Juliet style star-crossed lovers subplot (Mormon scion falls passionately in love with a young gentile woman--in the space of a week), and some of the lousiest writing ever to be foisted upon professional actors. I do credit the film for treating one of the most appalling events in the history of any religion with an appropriate mix of horror and detachment and for making a genuine effort to provide a dramatic context for the senseless slaughter of innocent pioneers at the hands of maniacal Mormon Church elders (Brigham Young among them). Other parts of the film just make very little sense, dramatically or historically--why waste 20 minutes of screen time depicting the Mormon scion's uncanny ability to ""break"" an ornery stallion? Why cast Dean Cain (yes, the Superman of ""Lois and Clark"") as Joseph Smith? (He's on screen very briefly but long enough to make you scoff at the awful casting choice.)

1114220,A34Q0S8PKOJEKP,B000XJ5TOU,,"[10, 23]","I was stunned at the fine craftsmanship and courageous candor of this film. The Mountain Meadows Massacre has been well documented outside the LDS Church and up until recently was spin doctored and rewritten into the dust by Mormon Apologists. It's been said well in other reviews but I'll echo it again, this movie very poignantly, dramatically and literately demonstrates the type of tragedy that can occur when fanaticism overcomes rational thought and behavior.It's a hard film to watch but it's a valuable film to digest and think about.That's because the zealot's blindness, denial, self-deception and irrational behavior that you see in this film is still very much alive today both inside and outside Mormonism. (Note:Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faithis a great resource if you're interested in the ""inside"" side of that last sentence)Regarding the ongoing Mountain Meadows Massacre controversy, I agreed with the consensus in the Special Features Documentaries of this DVD that BOTH sides would be calmed and defused by a FULL public acknowledgment of the LDS Church's culpability as well as an apology. [NOTE: A partial concession was issued on 9/11/2007 - the 150th anniversary of the massacre. See the comment I added on 6/18/2008 for the full text] I understand that this runs counter to the LDS Church's hyper-diligence on their public image (it would damage Brigham Young's spin doctored image as the infallible voice of God for example) BUT I really think that it would quiet the tumult a bit.If you're interested in reading more about the Mountain Meadows Massacre here are some other titles you might enjoy:The Mountain Meadows MassacreBlood of the Prophets: Brigham Young and the Massacre at Mountain MeadowsAmerican Massacre: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857If you're interested LDS Church History, the following book has been considered a watershed work since it's publication in 1945.

Such is the case with ""September Dawn"".The Christopher Cain film tells the story of the Mountain Meadows Mormon Massacre of September 11, 1857 filling in the events of what could have happened during those fateful days of September.With a fanatical edict, Brigham Young, ordered the strict observation of discouraging emigation through the Mormon controlled area of Utah a decade after their escape from persecution. Setting the stage for a conflict with the United states government, the moderate arm of the Church lost control to the fanatical element. Historical documents tell the story as one of lost communications between Young and the local Mormon Bishop Jacob Samuelson, while survivors tell a different version.The film stars Jon Voight as Jacob Samuelson, Terrence Stamp as Brigham Young, Trent Ford as Jonathan Samuelson, and Tamara Hope as Emily, the love interest to Jonathan. This presentation is a passionate look at the much disputed massacre that casts a dark shadow on the Mormons of the mid 1800's.Filmed in Alberta, ""September Dawn"", is a sweeping cinematic production that tries for the middle ground almost successfully. Injecting romance into the politically, religious struggle softens the film, yet its' inclusion makes the massacre more violent and senseless. Perhaps that is the true intent of the tale? In an entertainment environment inhabited by films more grandiose every year, subtle films packed with intelligent commentary are often lost in the mix. The intellectual debate over this event, especially at the 150th anniversary, has been rekindled.Will history ever resolve what happened those two weeks as the wagon train rested? The point is moot almost as the consequences of the massacre still resonate in the church and throughout history. The DVD includes two special features to balance the facts and fiction.This may not be the `truth', but if it is not, it is entertaining and presents a stark look at a dark moment in Mormon History. For the courage to present such a moment in time, Christopher Cain should be applauded.Ladies and gentlemen of the academy...Tim Lasiuta[...] and [...]",5,Outstanding.,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,2270,"['History', 'best', 'told', 'victors', 'History', 'can', 'also', 'be', 're-written', 're-imagined', 'depending', 'bias', 'intentions', 'writers', 'Such', 'case', 'September', 'Dawn', '.The', 'Christopher', 'Cain', 'film', 'story', 'Mountain', 'Meadows', 'Mormon', 'Massacre', 'September', '11', '1857', 'filling', 'events', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'fateful', 'days', 'September.With', 'fanatical', 'edict', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'ordered', 'strict', 'observation', 'discouraging', 'emigation', 'Mormon', 'controlled', 'area', 'Utah', 'decade', 'escape', 'persecution', 'Setting', 'stage', 'conflict', 'United', 'states', 'government', 'moderate', 'arm', 'Church', 'lost', 'control', 'fanatical', 'element', 'Historical', 'documents', 'tell', 'story', 'one', 'lost', 'communications', 'Young', 'local', 'Mormon', 'Bishop', 'Jacob', 'Samuelson', 'survivors', 'tell', 'different', 'version.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Jacob', 'Samuelson', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'Trent', 'Ford', 'Jonathan', 'Samuelson', 'Tamara', 'Hope', 'Emily', 'love', 'interest', 'Jonathan', 'presentation', 'passionate', 'look', 'much', 'disputed', 'massacre', 'dark', 'shadow', 'Mormons', 'mid', ""1800's.Filmed"", 'Alberta', 'September', 'Dawn', 'sweeping', 'cinematic', 'production', 'middle', 'ground', 'almost', 'successfully', 'Injecting', 'romance', 'politically', 'religious', 'struggle', 'film', 'inclusion', 'massacre', 'more', 'violent', 'senseless', 'Perhaps', 'true', 'intent', 'tale', 'entertainment', 'environment', 'inhabited', 'films', 'more', 'grandiose', 'year', 'subtle', 'films', 'packed', 'intelligent', 'commentary', 'are', 'often', 'lost', 'mix', 'intellectual', 'debate', 'event', 'especially', '150th', 'anniversary', 'been', 'rekindled.Will', 'history', 'ever', 'resolve', 'what', 'happened', 'two', 'weeks', 'wagon', 'train', 'rested', 'point', 'moot', 'almost', 'consequences', 'massacre', 'still', 'resonate', 'church', 'history', 'DVD', 'two', 'special', 'features', 'balance', 'facts', 'fiction.This', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'truth', 'not', 'entertaining', 'stark', 'look', 'dark', 'moment', 'Mormon', 'History', 'courage', 'present', 'moment', 'time', 'Christopher', 'Cain', 'should', 'be', 'applauded.Ladies', 'gentlemen', 'academy', 'Tim', 'Lasiuta', '[', ']', '[', ']']",September Dawn

Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you play crazy with conviction and, dare I say, heart.  The obscure doctrine, blood oaths, and early fanaticism was well portrayed, as was the corrupting obtuseness of polygamy and the obvious insanity of mixing governance & religion...yes, that was a castration in the beginning.  I also loved the use of a romance between the Mormon bishop's son and a mainstream preacher's daughter as a vehicle for a religious debate, though I don't think they made use of this enough.I did not like the generic uplifting horse/western-movie music during the first half.  Also, the directing or use of certain takes had some lines too rushed or otherwise incomprehensible to laymen.  Obscure references require less-than-obscure delivery, and reaction shots interspersed to stretch it.  The Bishop and son fighting about the dead mother is one instance.  Not the actors' fault.  While the writing was well done for the most part, sans the lack of exploiting the aforementioned debates more, there's an odd turn towards the end into cheap shots like pointing out how little education Brigham Young had or calling him the ""Mormon God"".I think this last point might derive from a hijacking of the film by a sort of Christian Coalition or evangelical attempt to pit protestant Christians against Mormons, stemming possibly from the belief some have that Mormons are not ""Christian"" and that they worship Joseph Smith.  Certainly to each his own.  There is even a case to be made in a manner of speaking.  Yet while within the film the ""unfailing voice of God"" attribute early leaders had is out in the open for criticism by all, these associated attacks outside of the culpability in the massacre itself lacked either objectivity or even proper subjective development when used by those outside the anti-Mormon mob shown in the film.While it's clear in the specific instance of the Mountain Meadows event that the perpetrators can be juxtaposed to the victims to show a revealing contrast in beliefs, this eventual slant in the general terms amounts to the pot calling the kettle black.  Multiple slips like that I'm afraid tipped their hand.  Ending with a country music song didn't help matters, giving September Dawn a faintly made-for-TV, patriotic right-wing cred like something that might play on God TV.  In spite of all this, the climax of the film does work.  The death scene is powerful.  We are left with a sense of having been shown a very obvious trend of culture, preceding timeline, and complex psychologies that led to yet another example of systemic mass murder.",3,A mass crime and the uniquely American religion could have used a better film,1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,2686,"['actors', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'zealot', 'quite', 'like', 'Voight', 'Ladies', 'gentlemen', 'how', 'play', 'crazy', 'conviction', 'dare', 'say', 'heart', 'obscure', 'doctrine', 'blood', 'oaths', 'early', 'fanaticism', 'was', 'well', 'portrayed', 'was', 'corrupting', 'obtuseness', 'polygamy', 'obvious', 'insanity', 'mixing', 'governance', 'religion', 'yes', 'was', 'castration', 'beginning', 'also', 'loved', 'use', 'romance', 'Mormon', 'bishop', 'son', 'mainstream', 'preacher', 'daughter', 'vehicle', 'religious', 'debate', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'made', 'use', 'enough.I', 'did', 'not', 'generic', 'uplifting', 'horse/western-movie', 'music', 'first', 'half', 'Also', 'directing', 'use', 'certain', 'had', 'lines', 'too', 'rushed', 'otherwise', 'incomprehensible', 'laymen', 'Obscure', 'references', 'require', 'less-than-obscure', 'delivery', 'reaction', 'shots', 'interspersed', 'stretch', 'Bishop', 'son', 'fighting', 'dead', 'mother', 'one', 'instance', 'Not', 'actors', 'fault', 'writing', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'most', 'part', 'lack', 'exploiting', 'aforementioned', 'debates', 'more', 'odd', 'turn', 'end', 'cheap', 'shots', 'pointing', 'out', 'how', 'little', 'education', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'had', 'calling', 'Mormon', 'God', '.I', 'think', 'last', 'point', 'might', 'derive', 'hijacking', 'film', 'sort', 'Christian', 'Coalition', 'evangelical', 'attempt', 'pit', 'protestant', 'Christians', 'Mormons', 'stemming', 'possibly', 'belief', 'have', 'Mormons', 'are', 'not', 'Christian', 'worship', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'Certainly', 'own', 'even', 'case', 'be', 'made', 'manner', 'speaking', 'film', 'unfailing', 'voice', 'God', 'attribute', 'early', 'leaders', 'had', 'out', 'open', 'criticism', 'associated', 'attacks', 'culpability', 'massacre', 'lacked', 'objectivity', 'even', 'proper', 'subjective', 'development', 'when', 'used', 'anti-Mormon', 'mob', 'shown', 'film.While', 'clear', 'specific', 'instance', 'Mountain', 'Meadows', 'event', 'perpetrators', 'can', 'be', 'juxtaposed', 'victims', 'show', 'revealing', 'contrast', 'beliefs', 'eventual', 'slant', 'general', 'terms', 'amounts', 'pot', 'calling', 'kettle', 'black', 'Multiple', 'slips', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'tipped', 'hand', 'Ending', 'country', 'music', 'song', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'giving', 'September', 'Dawn', 'faintly', 'made-for-TV', 'patriotic', 'right-wing', 'cred', 'something', 'might', 'play', 'God', 'TV', 'spite', 'climax', 'film', 'work', 'death', 'scene', 'powerful', 'are', 'left', 'sense', 'having', 'been', 'shown', 'very', 'obvious', 'trend', 'culture', 'preceding', 'timeline', 'complex', 'psychologies', 'led', 'yet', 'example', 'systemic', 'mass', 'murder']",September Dawn

Secondly, I'm not a Mormon, nordo I have an axe to grind with them or religion in general.That said, what did I think of this movie?  First  of all, it's a very relevant movie for our time.Somebody said, ""God save us from those who God speaks to.""  That can be a Mormon in 1857, a Muslim,a Christian, a Jew, or anybody else who claims certain knowledge of divine will.  The antagonistsin this film, have it from God that blood atonement is required for the death of Joseph Smith.  Thefact that those who must pay this price had nothing to do with that death is irrelevant because theMormon's are fearful of future aggrievances.The movie does not paint a very nice picture of Mormons, so if that is going to offend you, then thisis probably not a movie for you.  But if you're some evangelical who wants to paint Mormon's as evil,this is not something you need to be watching either.  Anders Breivik, Osama bin Laden, Jim Jones theyall have their hotline to God and this movie should be viewed as what humankind is capable of doing toother humans in the name of God, rather than trying to place blame on somebody for something thatadmittedly is merely ""inspired"" by actual events.Although, I don't consider this a great movie, it is a compelling movie.  It's not a feel good movieand it's not a movie I'm sure I want to watch again any time soon.  But it is a movie I'm glad that Iwatched.  It's not terrible acting as some have claimed.

But maybe a more honest question would be, ""What would be the non-anti-Mormon, non-propaganda view of the Mountain Meadows Massacre?"" An honest view of the MMM would involve perspective. Bigots and propagandists don't want perspective because it destroys their craft. They prey upon people who want easy answers rather than truth. They might feast their eyes on a Hollywood movie that infuses history with non-history and fictionalized melodramatic scenes, drop their jaws and gasp, and then go to Amazon and give it five stars.What, then, would be perspective about this horrible event? Perhaps we start by acknowledging that the affair absolutely was an atrocity; it was horrid. But fair, honest minds would simply want to know more. After searching, they would find out that the Latter-day Saints could not find justice or safety in their own country. During the first decades of their history they were harassed, killed, faced an ""Extermination Order against the Mormons"" issued by the Governor of the State of Missouri (an order that was followed by a massacre of Latter-day Saints at Haun's Mill), their homes burned, their women violated, property stolen, driven from place, to place, to place, to place. Finally their founding prophet was murdered via a conspiracy. And then one last exodus--that involved crossing our continent, during which hundreds dropped dead by the way and buried in shallow graves.Now, without having walked two meters in their shoes, where would you guess breaking point would be? Might you perhaps expect that there would be just a few, somewhere, who would decide on their own that enough is enough, and that if they appear to come for us again they will reap the whirlwind? There was also an atmosphere of hysteria at the time--brought on not by Brigham Young (Will Bagley's pet idea)--but by conditions and circumstances. Part of that were the rumors that the U.S. government was sending an army out to Utah to quell a ""Mormon rebellion."" The ""rebellion"" did not exist, but talk of an army approaching was true. Put it all together.None of this excuses them for their heinous actions.

Whoever wrote Amazon's grossly misleading ""product description"" which states that ""the question of whether the attack was carried out by local Paiute Indians or by a renegade sect of the Mormon church remains unresolved to this day"" is obviously a veritable moron. There is no question, none whatsoever, that the Mountain Meadows slaughter of so many innocent people was carried out by mainstream members of the mormon cult. Furthermore, this attack was not carried out by ""renegades"" - the attackers consisted of highly devote mainstream members of the cult, lead by one of their fanatics, John D. Lee - Brigham Young's ""adopted"" son. Until Lee was eventually executed as the cult's lone scapegoat (he was the only one ever ""punished"" for this abhorrent act of unabashed religious carnage), he had even appended ""Young"" to his surname. Lee was also a member of Young's ""death squad"" (the Danites), that was encharged with such benign (!?) things as carrying out their deeply held belief in ""blood atonement"" - the intentional murder of those who had committed ""sins"" in the eyes of the cult.Mentioning Brigham Young. . .yes, he was one the main architects of the massacre, the historical record not only shows that he played an integral role in the development of the cult's extremist views (many of which continue to guide the cult to this very day) but that he was one of the key figures and hatemongers of the  prevailing mormon attitude against ""gentiles"" (the cult's term for anyone who is not a mormon). Young was personally responsible for stirring up the cult's abhorrence for anyone outside their evil sect into a maelstrom of vitriolic venom that was used to justify their bloody carnage at Mountain Meadows. At the time of the cult's blood fest, Young was preparing for an ""attack"" by the United States against ""Deseret"" (the cult's name for the territory of Utah). As noted in the book, ""American Massacre: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857, "" author Sally Denton cogently notes that the Fancher party (the wagon train that was slaughtered) had passed through Salt Lake City prior to the execution, and were subjected to open hostility from the cult - they were denied much needed supplies and were sent on their way. From this point on, with just one exception, they met with the same treatment as they attempted to make their way to California (obviously, they never made it). There are many, many excellent books on this topic which (unless they were given the blessings of the cult's PR machine) provide the truth on this matter.As has been noted elsewhere, this movie does use a bit of ""artistic license"" by interweaving a ""love story"" into the otherwise accurate portrayal of this horrific historical event. While it does distract, a bit, from the actual tale, it also serves to show just how inhuman the cult really is.

All today's squabbles over religious intolerance seem pretty petty compared to some past times.  Dissenters Roger Williams and Anne Hathaway were banished from their early Rhode Island community, and people sometimes killed each other over what they believed.Before there was a millenium 9/11 by foreign forces, there was a domestic one on the plains known as the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  The beleaguered Mormons haunted by a perilous past, held onto their Utah territory with reason to believe they were to be removed by U.S. forces.  When the Fancher-Baker wagon train stopped at Mountain Meadows, they had three things in mind:  rest, replenish their supplies; then head to California.  Although many were from Arkansas, a few families followed into their train from Missouri, a place where Mormon land had been confiscated and their followers dispersed.  After leader Joseph Smith was killed in prison near Nauvoo, Illinois, the Utah Mormons, led by Brigham Young (Terence Stamp) and John D. Lee (Jon Gries), were willing to shed the blood of suspicious ""Gentiles"".  Working with Pauite Indians, the Mormons hoodwinked then massacred the &eacute;migr&eacute;s culminating on September 11, 1857.  Based on an apostle's allegedly heavenly visions, a question remains:  Were The Mormons deceived or did they misunderstand their messages?Although illuminating to watch, `September Dawn' comes off as an above par made-for-TV movie.  Not as accomplished or emotionally cohesive as `Amazing Grace,' the movie remains better-than-average historical fiction.  Jon Voight as Mormon ""apostle"" Jacob Samuelton leads a lesser known cast through a drama of prejudice and counter prejudice anchored by a fictitious couple, Emily Hudson (Tamara Hope) and Jonathan Samuelton (Trent Ford).  Both being mouth-pieces of tolerance, an element of `Romeo and Juliet' enters the strife with a partially effective import.Many of the flashback scenes of wrongs the Mormon's endured are done in old-fashioned double-imaging, thanks to editor Jack Hofstra.  The movie's often shot beautifully with a `Horse Whisperer' scene and a romantic moonlight scene to give the film some depth.  If you were queasy about 'Rambo,' you may want to be forewarned here:  Some of the footage is unsettling.  Overall, the level of interest you have in these events will effect the level of satisfaction you have with the movie.(Comic relief:  When Emily expresses her love for Jonathan, Robert Humphries [Huntley Ritter] warns her she'll be ""...one of his many wives,"" but ""At least you'll have some help with the dishes."")A J.P.'s Pan 2 *'s= Mediocre",2,Unforgiving Prejudices,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,2699,"['much', 'American', 'life', 'religious', 'freedom', 'tolerance', 'have', 'evolved', 'time', 'today', 'squabbles', 'religious', 'intolerance', 'seem', 'pretty', 'petty', 'compared', 'past', 'times', 'Dissenters', 'Roger', 'Williams', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'were', 'banished', 'early', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'community', 'people', 'sometimes', 'killed', 'other', 'what', 'believed.Before', 'was', 'millenium', '9/11', 'foreign', 'forces', 'was', 'domestic', 'one', 'plains', 'known', 'Mountain', 'Meadows', 'Massacre', 'beleaguered', 'Mormons', 'haunted', 'perilous', 'past', 'held', 'Utah', 'territory', 'reason', 'believe', 'were', 'be', 'removed', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'When', 'Fancher-Baker', 'wagon', 'train', 'stopped', 'Mountain', 'Meadows', 'had', 'three', 'things', 'mind', 'rest', 'replenish', 'supplies', 'then', 'head', 'California', 'many', 'were', 'Arkansas', 'few', 'families', 'followed', 'train', 'Missouri', 'place', 'where', 'Mormon', 'land', 'had', 'been', 'confiscated', 'followers', 'dispersed', 'leader', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'was', 'killed', 'prison', 'Nauvoo', 'Illinois', 'Utah', 'Mormons', 'led', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'John', 'D.', 'Lee', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'were', 'willing', 'shed', 'blood', 'suspicious', 'Gentiles', 'Working', 'Pauite', 'Indians', 'Mormons', 'hoodwinked', 'then', 'massacred', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'culminating', 'September', '11', '1857', 'Based', 'apostle', 'allegedly', 'heavenly', 'visions', 'question', 'Were', 'Mormons', 'deceived', 'did', 'misunderstand', 'messages', 'illuminating', 'watch', 'September', 'Dawn', 'off', 'par', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'Not', 'accomplished', 'emotionally', 'cohesive', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'movie', 'better-than-average', 'historical', 'fiction', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Mormon', 'apostle', 'Jacob', 'Samuelton', 'lesser', 'known', 'cast', 'drama', 'prejudice', 'counter', 'prejudice', 'anchored', 'fictitious', 'couple', 'Emily', 'Hudson', 'Tamara', 'Hope', 'Jonathan', 'Samuelton', 'Trent', 'Ford', 'being', 'mouth-pieces', 'tolerance', 'element', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'enters', 'strife', 'partially', 'effective', 'import.Many', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'wrongs', 'Mormon', 'endured', 'are', 'done', 'old-fashioned', 'double-imaging', 'thanks', 'editor', 'Jack', 'Hofstra', 'movie', 'often', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'scene', 'romantic', 'moonlight', 'scene', 'give', 'film', 'depth', 'were', 'queasy', ""'Rambo"", 'may', 'want', 'be', 'forewarned', 'here', 'footage', 'unsettling', 'Overall', 'level', 'interest', 'have', 'events', 'will', 'effect', 'level', 'satisfaction', 'have', 'movie', 'Comic', 'relief', 'When', 'Emily', 'love', 'Jonathan', 'Robert', 'Humphries', '[', 'Huntley', 'Ritter', ']', ""'ll"", 'be', 'one', 'many', 'wives', 'least', ""'ll"", 'have', 'help', 'dishes', 'J.P.', 'Pan', '2', ""*'s="", 'Mediocre']",September Dawn

1114240,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000XJ5TOU,,"[5, 8]","""September Dawn"" (2007) is a powerful and unforgettable film. It details the long covered-up massacre at Mountain Meadows, Utah, on September 11, 1857 where a group of Mormons murdered well over a hundred settlers traveling from Arkansas to California. The settlers stopped in Utah to rest and resupply and the Mormons graciously allowed it. Unfortunately, in the ensuing days the decision was made to slaughter the settlers, likely due to paranoia over the brief ""Utah War"" that was going on at the time (between the Feds and the Mormon settlers in Utah) and also because of the Mormons' severe persecutions back East in the 1830s-40s, which provoked them to seek sanctuary in Utah in 1847.Brigham Young was the president of the LDS denomination at the time and the governor of Utah. Was he involved in the decision to slaughter the innocent settlers? Although Mormon leaders deny this to this day it's very probable for two reasons: (1.) As the LDS president and Utah governor it's unlikely that something of this magnitude would have been carried out without Young's authorization; and (2.) the leader of the slaughter, John D. Lee - the only man convicted and shot for the massacre - was the adopted son of Brigham Young. The film theorizes that the murderers took an oath of silence and that's why the massacre has been covered-up by LDS officials to this day, although Lee admitted to being the scapegoat before his execution. Chew on that.The vibe of the film is very realistic, sort of like ""Dances with Wolves (Full Screen Theatrical Edition),"" although not as compelling. For instance, the Paiute natives (whom the Mormons hoodwinked into participating in the initial assault) are very well done. The acting is convincing across the board. In this regard ""September Dawn"" stands head & shoulders above roll-your-eyes Westerns of yesteryear.Perhaps the film has such an authentic vibe because it's based on the historical facts and is fair with them. For one, the film utilizes Juanita Brooks' book and others as sources, and they happen to be a devout Mormons. Secondly, the film reveals the valid reasons for the Mormon's paranoia - due to the Feds' harassment presently and also previous persecutions back East, severe persecutions. Thirdly, the film details a bizarre doctrine the Mormons adhered to - ""blood atonement"" - that gave them the mentality that they were doing the settlers a favor by killing them (that is, the settlers would die to this temporal world  but they'd be eternally blessed, or something to this effect).Some have criticized the film for adding a romantic subplot concerning a Mormon youth and a settler girl, but this is a typical Hollywood technique, e.g. ""Pearl Harbor (Two-Disc 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition),"" ""The Red Baron"" and ""Titanic."" Others object to a Mormon youth cracking up after the massacre - another purely fictional addition - but it makes sense that an unhardened youth would lose his marbles, so to speak, after such a horrific undertaking and, again, it's portrayed in a convincing manner.Although the film takes place in Southwest Utah, it was filmed in central Alberta, near Calgary.Bottom Line: The harsh criticism that's been dished on this film is ridiculous and not even remotely accurate. Although it's sometimes a hard film to watch for obvious reasons, ""September Dawn"" is a worthy modern Western that dares to sneer at political correctness and tell the truth, at least as far as can be done by the documented facts. Sure there's some fictionalization, but all movies based on historical events do this to some extent. I guarantee you that ""September Dawn"" is far more historically accurate than heralded films like ""Braveheart."" Since the film is so well done I can only chalk up the ridiculous criticism to intolerant liberal ideology. After all, the film dares to show Christians in a positive light being led to the slaughter literally by wacko non-Christian religious fanatics. Not that all Mormons back then or today are wacko religious fanatics, not at all, but that group that murdered the innocent settlers definitely were, and those who authorized it as well.GRADE: Borderline A- or B+",5,A story that had to be told and needs to be known,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,4174,"['September', 'Dawn', '2007', 'powerful', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'details', 'long', 'covered-up', 'massacre', 'Mountain', 'Meadows', 'Utah', 'September', '11', '1857', 'where', 'group', 'Mormons', 'murdered', 'well', 'hundred', 'settlers', 'traveling', 'Arkansas', 'California', 'settlers', 'stopped', 'Utah', 'rest', 'resupply', 'Mormons', 'graciously', 'allowed', 'Unfortunately', 'ensuing', 'days', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'slaughter', 'settlers', 'likely', 'due', 'paranoia', 'brief', 'Utah', 'War', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'Feds', 'Mormon', 'settlers', 'Utah', 'also', 'Mormons', 'severe', 'persecutions', 'back', 'East', '1830s-40s', 'provoked', 'seek', 'sanctuary', 'Utah', '1847.Brigham', 'Young', 'was', 'president', 'LDS', 'denomination', 'time', 'governor', 'Utah', 'Was', 'involved', 'decision', 'slaughter', 'innocent', 'settlers', 'Mormon', 'leaders', 'deny', 'day', 'very', 'probable', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'LDS', 'president', 'Utah', 'governor', 'unlikely', 'something', 'magnitude', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'carried', 'Young', 'authorization', '2', 'leader', 'slaughter', 'John', 'D.', 'Lee', 'only', 'man', 'convicted', 'shot', 'massacre', 'was', 'adopted', 'son', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'film', 'murderers', 'took', 'oath', 'silence', 'why', 'massacre', 'been', 'covered-up', 'LDS', 'officials', 'day', 'Lee', 'admitted', 'being', 'scapegoat', 'execution', 'Chew', 'that.The', 'vibe', 'film', 'very', 'realistic', 'sort', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Theatrical', 'Edition', 'not', 'compelling', 'instance', 'Paiute', 'natives', 'whom', 'Mormons', 'hoodwinked', 'participating', 'initial', 'assault', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'convincing', 'board', 'regard', 'September', 'Dawn', 'head', 'shoulders', 'roll-your-eyes', 'Westerns', 'yesteryear.Perhaps', 'film', 'authentic', 'vibe', 'based', 'historical', 'facts', 'fair', 'one', 'film', 'utilizes', 'Juanita', 'Brooks', 'book', 'others', 'sources', 'happen', 'be', 'devout', 'Mormons', 'Secondly', 'film', 'valid', 'reasons', 'Mormon', 'paranoia', 'due', 'Feds', 'harassment', 'presently', 'also', 'previous', 'persecutions', 'back', 'East', 'severe', 'persecutions', 'Thirdly', 'film', 'details', 'bizarre', 'doctrine', 'Mormons', 'adhered', 'blood', 'atonement', 'gave', 'mentality', 'were', 'doing', 'settlers', 'favor', 'killing', 'settlers', 'would', 'die', 'temporal', 'world', ""'d"", 'be', 'eternally', 'blessed', 'something', 'effect', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'adding', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'concerning', 'Mormon', 'youth', 'settler', 'girl', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'technique', 'e.g', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Two-Disc', '60th', 'Anniversary', 'Commemorative', 'Edition', 'Red', 'Baron', 'Titanic', 'Others', 'object', 'Mormon', 'youth', 'cracking', 'up', 'massacre', 'purely', 'fictional', 'addition', 'sense', 'unhardened', 'youth', 'would', 'lose', 'marbles', 'so', 'speak', 'horrific', 'undertaking', 'again', 'portrayed', 'convincing', 'film', 'place', 'Southwest', 'Utah', 'was', 'filmed', 'central', 'Alberta', 'Calgary.Bottom', 'Line', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'been', 'dished', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'accurate', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'film', 'watch', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'September', 'Dawn', 'worthy', 'modern', 'Western', 'sneer', 'political', 'correctness', 'tell', 'truth', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'documented', 'facts', 'Sure', 'fictionalization', 'movies', 'based', 'historical', 'events', 'do', 'extent', 'guarantee', 'September', 'Dawn', 'far', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'heralded', 'films', 'Braveheart', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'only', 'chalk', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'criticism', 'intolerant', 'liberal', 'ideology', 'film', 'show', 'Christians', 'positive', 'light', 'being', 'led', 'slaughter', 'literally', 'wacko', 'non-Christian', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'Not', 'Mormons', 'back', 'then', 'today', 'are', 'wacko', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'not', 'group', 'murdered', 'innocent', 'settlers', 'definitely', 'were', 'who', 'authorized', 'well.GRADE', 'Borderline', 'A-', 'B+']",September Dawn
1114241,A209QRVZ99UQDC,B000XJ5TOU,,"[6, 13]","This is a difficult movie to watch. It's a frightening, gut-wrenching film of how Brigham Young ordered the slaughter of a wagon train filled with 140 innocent Christian men, women and children, some originating from Missouri, the death place of Joseph Smith. Their only mission was to rest on Mormon land and refuel their supplies before moving on to California.Brigham Young, angered that someone from Missouri had killed the prophet Joseph Smith, wanted revenge, and he didn't care from whom he extracted it. He blamed his lust for blood on God, telling to his followers that God ordered the massacre of the wagon train of non-Mormon heathens. His followers blindly obeyed. They deceived the wagon train by giving them shelter and rest in an area where the perfect slaughter could take place with little resistance, and without any prior warning. Then, with the help of local Indians, and after the Mormons gained the trust of the Christians, Brigham Young ordered the brutal attack to commence. His followers separated the men from the women and children before turning their guns on the men. The women and children were slaughtered by Mormons and Indians hiding within the woods. Everyone old enough to speak - to give witness to the slaughter and the truth - was shot with arrows or bullets, stabbed, or had their throats slit, even the kids.  Newborns were spared and handed out to Mormon couples across the land, like prizes from a party.Until seeing this movie, I'd never heard anything about the Mountain Meadows Massacre. I went searching for evidence that it didn't happen, hoping that Hollywood had over-reacted. But there is nothing to dispute it - nothing except the protest from Mormons who are angered that the truth has finally been revealed.Jon Voight is excellent. Dean Cane has a bit role.

Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[74, 91]","Been waiting for this DVD to come out since first seeing it in the theatres- and having since read several histories about the historical event. There already have been numerous website slugfests about just how accurate the movie is, with most of the debate just re-emphasizing how, 150 years later, the Mormon community still struggles to reconcile this documented part of their church history.But before the DVD is even released, and before the anticipated subsequent storm of prejudiced-laced customer ""reviews"" ( and it doesn't even matter which side they are for), let me just say that the ""editorial review"" summary ought to at least introduce the topic fairly. For one, it is hardly an issue of uncertainty whether or not Mormons participated in the massacre- indeed, the valid histories (even the source work by Juanita Brooks, herself a devout Mormon)all confirm that Mormons did most of the killing, and even eventually owned-up to that, but only after years of trying to pawn it off on the Paiute Indians. I've seen the movie and read the histories, and the only aspect of the movie which is somewhat ""over-the-top"" is its clear portrayal of Brigham Young as a main architect of the massacre; the available histories at least conclude that there is some doubt as to his actual role. Whether viewers of the movie liked the love story subplot or not isn't really what this movie is about, after all....it's just a cinematic technique used to make the history more personal (much like Cameron did with ""Titanic"", and Kate Winslett and Leonard DiCaprio).But having said that, I'm sure the DVD release of this movie will again spark all the prejudicial comments about Mormons, etc.....but none of that changes the facts, and the movie does a fair job with that.

1114249,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B000XJ5TOU,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[1, 1]","The sheer excellence of this motion picture (Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 19816 being the North American DVD edition viewed) took me by surprise. I had expected this docudrama to be one that evangelicals would have used for their own purposes to defame L.D.S. Mormonism, with clearly apologetic aims. That is not the case, at all, to my relief. This film, without overt religious partisanship for either side, puts into nauseating light the L.D.S. Mormon perpetration of this blight upon U.S. history (which occurred, however, with even less Paiute Indian participation than it suggests), one of the most infamous genocidally and religiously motivated mass atrocities in the history of the U. S. of A. and of its then territories. This event of early Mormonism fully deserves this brutal, mostly factually accurate retelling of the massacre at Mountain Meadows, in Utah, an account that is historically and humanely motivated rather than being merely some religious cinematic diatribe.I should have realised, even before seeing the film, that the illustrious likes of Jon Voight, Trent Ford, and Terence Stamp, among the other excellent cast, would not stoop to doing an ""hatchet job"" on Mormons for some neo-evangelical, Pentecostal, or fundamentalist Christian film outfit. The movie was shot in Alberta, the Dominion of Canada's own most Mormon-infested province, which only seems fitting. Alberta stands in reasonably well for Utah, both of them, anyway, sharing the topography of the Northwest Rockies area of the North American continent.It is difficult for me to be entirely objective about the Mountain Meadowns Massacre. Although I was born and raised in California, I have family, both among my paternal and maternal relatives, indirectly or perhaps even directly associated with this tawdry L.D.S. Mormon incident in Western U.S. history. My mother was raised L.D.S. Mormon, hailing from Salt Lake City, her entire extended family being Mormon (until, gradually, almost all of them, one by one, became Christians over the decades, something that seldom happens in families of L.D.S. Mormon culture). My father's family hails from Arkansas, my grandmother, in fact, being from Harrison, Ark. itself, the very city from which the wagon train depicted in the film, consisting of would-be settlers from Arkansas, with some from Missouri among them, departed for California (and never made it) as this film depicts them on the Utah stretch of its fatal trek. It is even quite possible that I am descended from the mid-19th century perpetrators and/or the victims of this famous genocidal incident. (I do not know enough of my family's genealogy and history, having been raised under a step-father too hostile to my own paternal birth family and too indifferent to my mother's, to know that for certain and, anyway, my mother spoke little of these matters.) Understandably, therefore, this movie is about a slice of history that always has interested me and about which I have done much reading over the years. I can assert confidently that the film depicts what happened quite factually, apart, of course, from the romantic ""love interest"" that the movie provides between the Mormon boy and the Christian girl among the wagon train with whom the L.D.S. lad falls in love.The acting is very, very fine; this cast, every one in it, famous or otherwise, does wonderfully well with their parts. Terence Stamp and Jonathan Voight, of course, are quite celebrated film stars. For all of that, it is Trent Ford, youthfully handsome and tenderly ardent as Jonathan, the fictitious Mormon boy who falls in love, to such tragic outcome, with a young lady among those in the wagon train, who is my own favourite among the cast. The extra features are both historically illuminating and very worthwhile to view before or after watching the film itself. The subtitles, of which I followed those in English, are clear and, fortunately, helpful and not at all unduly intrusive.",5,Brilliant & Satisfactorily Accurate Cinematic Depiction of the Massacre by L.D.S.

Glad I can get mine in before the comment wars begin. I liked the movie overall. As a professor of religion I know the story accords with historical facts of the Mountain Meadows massacre as well as we know them. It truly does show how human beings can do the most atrocious things to one another if they believe they receive the blessing of God in doing so. I would only wish they ask some basic epistemological questions about the justification of their claim to knowledge that it is God they are truly hearing. The film mentions possible motives like the belief the federal government was about to start a war against the Mormons and payback for the murder of Joseph Smith in Missouri. One explanation for the massacre the film does not address but needs to be explored is using religious justification for plain old greed. There was a lot of wealth, cattle and horses with that wagon train. The Paiutes didn't get it. Who did? The film nicely points out how John Lee is the only Mormon forced to suffer penalty for the event. As for the film itself, it is beautifully filmed. I thought the Davidovich character was shallow, and her death is left unexplained. The real clinker in the film, though, and the reason I reduce its rating to a three star, is the clumsily melodramatic love affair between the son of the Mormon Bishop and the daughter of the wagon train's minister. As part of that story you have the son being imprisoned by the Bishop by being chained at the ankle in a barn. The chain, though, is around his boot. Why doesn't the kid just remove his foot from the boot? That's the kind of silliness that creeps in when you import melodrama into this tragic story. My greatest concern: The Mormons (with the exception of the lovestruck son of the Bishop) were uniformly caricatured as the embodiment of hate, while those on the wagon train were uniformly portrayed as the embodiment of sweetness and light. That's too simple-minded an approach. There are other comments to be made, but I don't want to turn this into a lecture on religion.

As many of its' detractors have said this is a very biased in terms of the agenda of blame and has taken quite a few `rumours' and presented them as fact.In the film we meet the Baker-Fancher wagon train as they enter the area of Iron County, Utah where they are stopped by the local militia and told to move on. Then Bishop Jacob Samuelson (legendary `Jon Voight')arrives with his two sons and decides to let them stay but he insists they camp at Mountain Meadow, which they agree gladly to do, as their livestock needed grazing and watering. The Bishop's son Jonathan (Trent Ford) meets with the young and pretty Emily (Tamara Hope) and it's sort of love at first sight. He is also a horse whisperer and tames an aggressive stallion in a very touching scene.Then we move back to the Bishop who starts to whip up anti `gentile' fervour on these immigrants. Despite the advice of his son he eventually foments an attack to kill the whole wagon train. But they want to make it look like the Native American Paiute tribe carried out the attack. What unfolds is a tale based on the actual events but with a lot of anti Mormon feeling being injected for no historical reason at all. Brigham Young is played by Terence Stamp and he comes across as not having one iota of decency, which has to have been intentional.From an historical perspective the film says this train was from Arkansas and Missouri which is true, and that as the Mormons were driven from Missouri this acted as a catalyst for their revenge. Actually the Utah War was in full swing with a distrust of all outsiders because of President Buchannan's heavy handed approach. Brigham Young had just ordered martial law and for grain to be stockpiled in case Federal troops did invade. Also Mountain Meadow was on the old Spanish trail and was well known to wagon train leaders like Fencher as he had done two trips already. The film says that the Bishop chose it as an ideal ambush point, well not that ideal as the initial attack was on the 7th September and it was only after a five day siege that the Wagon train party were duped into being disarmed and that came about because the militia thought that they had given themselves away as being white and feared about the consequences of a clearly illegal and immoral act.The sad thing is the wagon train clearly had not realised their attackers were white or the duplicity of the Militia would not have worked. Had they realised this at the time they could have called off the slaughter, sadly they did not. So as a piece of cinema for history lovers - not that good, as a film I found it really rather engaging and very nearly a four star film. However, the material inaccuracies and the storm of controversy that this whipped up on release in America mean that this has caused harm and the spreading of lies which is unnecessary and divisive. It failed to take into account the politics of the time or the fact that Brigham Young actually sent a letter ordering the party safe passage, which sadly arrived on the 13th September. All of that said this got me interested in a piece of history that I knew nothing about and now I have had the diversion of doing some research, so it aint all bad and there are some really good performances and as I said I was quite gripped by the whole thing.",3,Controversial Telling of the Mountain Meadows Massacre of 1857,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,3440,"['Canadian', 'made', 'film', 'set', 'out', 'dramatise', 'slaughter', '120', 'men', 'women', 'children', '11th', 'September', '1857', 'many', 'detractors', 'have', 'said', 'very', 'biased', 'terms', 'agenda', 'blame', 'taken', 'quite', 'few', 'rumours', 'presented', 'fact.In', 'film', 'meet', 'Baker-Fancher', 'wagon', 'train', 'enter', 'area', 'Iron', 'County', 'Utah', 'where', 'are', 'stopped', 'local', 'militia', 'told', 'move', 'Then', 'Bishop', 'Jacob', 'Samuelson', 'legendary', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'two', 'sons', 'decides', 'let', 'stay', 'camp', 'Mountain', 'Meadow', 'agree', 'gladly', 'do', 'livestock', 'needed', 'grazing', 'watering', 'Bishop', 'son', 'Jonathan', 'Trent', 'Ford', 'young', 'pretty', 'Emily', 'Tamara', 'Hope', 'sort', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'also', 'horse', 'whisperer', 'aggressive', 'stallion', 'very', 'touching', 'scene.Then', 'move', 'back', 'Bishop', 'who', 'whip', 'up', 'anti', 'gentile', 'fervour', 'immigrants', 'advice', 'son', 'eventually', 'attack', 'kill', 'whole', 'wagon', 'train', 'want', 'make', 'look', 'Native', 'American', 'Paiute', 'tribe', 'carried', 'attack', 'What', 'tale', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'lot', 'anti', 'Mormon', 'feeling', 'being', 'injected', 'historical', 'reason', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'played', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'across', 'not', 'having', 'one', 'iota', 'decency', 'have', 'been', 'historical', 'perspective', 'film', 'train', 'was', 'Arkansas', 'Missouri', 'true', 'Mormons', 'were', 'driven', 'Missouri', 'acted', 'catalyst', 'revenge', 'Actually', 'Utah', 'War', 'was', 'full', 'swing', 'distrust', 'outsiders', 'President', 'Buchannan', 'heavy', 'handed', 'approach', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'had', 'just', 'ordered', 'martial', 'law', 'grain', 'be', 'stockpiled', 'case', 'Federal', 'troops', 'did', 'invade', 'Also', 'Mountain', 'Meadow', 'was', 'old', 'Spanish', 'trail', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'wagon', 'train', 'leaders', 'like', 'Fencher', 'had', 'done', 'two', 'trips', 'already', 'film', 'Bishop', 'chose', 'ideal', 'ambush', 'point', 'well', 'not', 'that', 'initial', 'attack', 'was', '7th', 'September', 'was', 'only', 'five', 'day', 'siege', 'Wagon', 'train', 'party', 'were', 'duped', 'being', 'disarmed', 'came', 'about', 'militia', 'thought', 'had', 'given', 'away', 'being', 'white', 'feared', 'consequences', 'clearly', 'illegal', 'immoral', 'act.The', 'sad', 'thing', 'wagon', 'train', 'clearly', 'had', 'not', 'realised', 'attackers', 'were', 'white', 'duplicity', 'Militia', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'Had', 'realised', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'called', 'off', 'slaughter', 'sadly', 'did', 'not', 'So', 'piece', 'cinema', 'history', 'lovers', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'found', 'really', 'rather', 'engaging', 'very', 'nearly', 'four', 'star', 'film', 'However', 'material', 'inaccuracies', 'storm', 'controversy', 'whipped', 'up', 'release', 'America', 'mean', 'caused', 'harm', 'spreading', 'lies', 'unnecessary', 'divisive', 'failed', 'take', 'account', 'politics', 'time', 'fact', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'actually', 'sent', 'letter', 'ordering', 'party', 'safe', 'passage', 'sadly', 'arrived', '13th', 'September', 'said', 'got', 'interested', 'piece', 'history', 'knew', 'nothing', 'now', 'have', 'had', 'diversion', 'doing', 'research', 'bad', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'performances', 'said', 'was', 'quite', 'gripped', 'whole', 'thing']",September Dawn
