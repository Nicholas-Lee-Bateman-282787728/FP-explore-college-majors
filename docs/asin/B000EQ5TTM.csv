976801,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B000EQ5TTM,Amanda Richards,"[55, 56]","Sadly we have now come to the end of this wonderful musical series created by Janice Burgess.  We own all five DVDs, and the first one ""It's Great to be a Ghost"" is still a regular on our play list, as are the others.This one has four episodes as usual, two of which were also included in the Nick Jr Favorites DVDs.  The list for this one is:Surf's Up: Pablo, Tyrone and Uniqua brush up their ""rad"" surfing moves in order to ride the perfect wave at Tiki Beach, but who is that mysterious lifeguard?Riding the Range: Tyrone is on his way to Texas, and meets up with Pablo, Uniqua and Tasha who're tracking down a jump-rope bandit.Race to the Tower of Power: Two supervillains battle it out with two superheroes for possession of the Key to the World and with it, world domination. Whahahahhahaha!!The Quest for Flying Rock: Four explorers quibble over the directions on a mysterious map, and end up having an obstacle race.This series is highly recommended for children of all ages, and is one of the most imaginative and entertaining at the moment.  If some of the other shows make you want to put on earplugs and run out of the room, you'll find this one a refreshing change.Please Ms. Burgess, may we have some more?Amanda Richards, June 14, 2006Edited to note: The series has been renewed and there are more DVDs available since I wrote this review.",5,"Please Ms. Burgess, may we have some more?",1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,1354,"['Sadly', 'have', 'now', 'come', 'end', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'series', 'created', 'Janice', 'Burgess', 'own', 'five', 'DVDs', 'first', 'one', 'Great', 'be', 'Ghost', 'still', 'regular', 'play', 'list', 'are', 'others.This', 'one', 'four', 'episodes', 'usual', 'two', 'were', 'also', 'included', 'Nick', 'Jr', 'Favorites', 'DVDs', 'list', 'one', 'Surf', 'Up', 'Pablo', 'Tyrone', 'Uniqua', 'brush', 'up', 'rad', 'surfing', 'moves', 'order', 'ride', 'perfect', 'wave', 'Tiki', 'Beach', 'who', 'mysterious', 'lifeguard', 'Riding', 'Range', 'Tyrone', 'way', 'Texas', 'up', 'Pablo', 'Uniqua', 'Tasha', 'who', ""'re"", 'tracking', 'down', 'jump-rope', 'bandit.Race', 'Tower', 'Power', 'Two', 'supervillains', 'battle', 'out', 'two', 'superheroes', 'possession', 'Key', 'World', 'world', 'domination', 'Whahahahhahaha', 'Quest', 'Flying', 'Rock', 'Four', 'explorers', 'quibble', 'directions', 'mysterious', 'map', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'obstacle', 'race.This', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended', 'children', 'ages', 'one', 'most', 'imaginative', 'entertaining', 'moment', 'other', 'shows', 'make', 'want', 'put', 'earplugs', 'run', 'out', 'room', ""'ll"", 'find', 'one', 'refreshing', 'change.Please', 'Ms.', 'Burgess', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'Amanda', 'Richards', 'June', '14', '2006Edited', 'note', 'series', 'been', 'renewed', 'are', 'more', 'DVDs', 'available', 'wrote', 'review']",N/A
976802,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B000EQ5TTM,Armando N. Roman,"[5, 5]","I'm a parent, and my daughter loves the Backyardigans. It was the first show that really got her attention when she wasn't even a year old. In the last 3 years, -I've- gotten into the Backyardigans, and know nearly all the songs by heart. This dvd contains some of the most memorable episodes and songs, and that's saying a lot considering how catchy so many of them are.Surf's Up is the episode where Pablo's looking for the perfect wave on Tiki Beach. While searching, he joins up with Tyrone and Uniqua, while being followed by the mysterious lifeguard, Austin. The music for this episode is Afro-pop, and very cool. And you gotta love those super super rad, totally rad moves the gang shows off on their boards.Riding the Range has Tyrone going to a hoedown while Uniqua, Pablo and Tasha look for a bandit. The music here is more hip-hop, and it's great having Tyrone hopping along with those smooth hoedown moves to the beat. Ridin' the range, let's go! This episode has a little bit of western action involving horses too!Then there are the two 'bonus' episodes. I don't like how they're listed as bonus episodes when they could just say that this dvd has 4 regular episodes. These two are Race to the Tower of Power and The Quest for the Flying Rock. Tower of Power is a cool superhero episoe where Tyrone and Pablo are the bad guys, and Uniqua and Austin are the heroes trying to stop them from doing bad guy-type things. Music genre for this episode = Latin. Finally is my favorite episode of the bunch, and one of my top episodes, the Flying Rock. The gang looks for a magical flying rock (yeah, it doesn't actually give you powers, it's just a small, flying rock that they want to go see) and splits up into two teams, trying to beat eachother to it. This is a kind of boys vs girls episode with insanely good disco music. The first song and dance in this episode needs to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It's right up there with Thriller I tell you.If you don't have cable and want to give your child a shot with the show, I highly recommend this dvd because of the music and episode theme diversity. Though that goes for most of the other Backyardigans dvds, I guess I'm just biased because this one has the Flying Rock episode. 5 stars, easy.",5,One of the best Backyardigans dvds ever.,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,2273,"[""'m"", 'parent', 'daughter', 'Backyardigans', 'was', 'first', 'show', 'really', 'got', 'attention', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'year', 'old', 'last', '3', 'years', ""-I've-"", 'gotten', 'Backyardigans', 'know', 'nearly', 'songs', 'heart', 'dvd', 'most', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'songs', 'saying', 'lot', 'considering', 'how', 'catchy', 'so', 'many', 'are.Surf', 'Up', 'episode', 'where', 'Pablo', 'looking', 'perfect', 'wave', 'Tiki', 'Beach', 'searching', 'up', 'Tyrone', 'Uniqua', 'being', 'followed', 'mysterious', 'lifeguard', 'Austin', 'music', 'episode', 'Afro-pop', 'very', 'cool', 'got', 'ta', 'super', 'super', 'rad', 'totally', 'rad', 'gang', 'boards.Riding', 'Range', 'Tyrone', 'going', 'hoedown', 'Uniqua', 'Pablo', 'Tasha', 'look', 'bandit', 'music', 'here', 'more', 'hip-hop', 'great', 'having', 'Tyrone', 'hopping', 'along', 'smooth', 'hoedown', 'moves', 'beat', 'Ridin', 'range', 'let', 'go', 'episode', 'little', 'bit', 'western', 'action', 'involving', 'horses', 'too', 'Then', 'are', 'two', ""'bonus"", 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', ""'re"", 'listed', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'when', 'could', 'just', 'say', 'dvd', '4', 'regular', 'episodes', 'two', 'are', 'Race', 'Tower', 'Power', 'Quest', 'Flying', 'Rock', 'Tower', 'Power', 'cool', 'superhero', 'episoe', 'where', 'Tyrone', 'Pablo', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'Uniqua', 'Austin', 'are', 'heroes', 'trying', 'stop', 'doing', 'bad', 'guy-type', 'things', 'Music', 'genre', 'episode', 'Latin', 'Finally', 'favorite', 'episode', 'bunch', 'one', 'top', 'episodes', 'Flying', 'Rock', 'gang', 'magical', 'flying', 'rock', 'yeah', ""n't"", 'actually', 'give', 'powers', 'just', 'small', 'flying', 'rock', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'up', 'two', 'teams', 'trying', 'beat', 'kind', 'boys', 'vs', 'girls', 'episode', 'insanely', 'good', 'disco', 'music', 'first', 'song', 'dance', 'episode', 'be', 'inducted', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'right', 'there', 'Thriller', 'tell', 'you.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'want', 'give', 'child', 'shot', 'show', 'highly', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'music', 'episode', 'theme', 'diversity', 'most', 'other', 'Backyardigans', 'dvds', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'biased', 'because', 'one', 'Flying', 'Rock', 'episode', '5', 'stars', 'easy']",N/A
