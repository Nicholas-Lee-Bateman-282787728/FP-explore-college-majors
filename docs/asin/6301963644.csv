274680,A1BXPI18MLL5OV,6301963644,"Alexandra Fox ""opera connoisseur""","[2, 2]","""All This and Heaven, Too"" certainly describes what kind of a movie it is. It's stupendous. It displays a lovely Bette Davis performance: she is sweet and tender. She doesn't seem to have the normal deviousness or quick wits. She shows grace and poise and is uncharacteristically innocent. She is charming and young-although she is not as young as her character is supposed to be. It is a different Bette film, that we have never seen before.Barbara O'Neil is perfect as the whiny, jealous, needy, and annoying wife. Charles Boyer is the perfect gallant, fatherly, caring,  kind-hearted, and loving Monsieur le Duc. And the actor who plays the missionary is very good as the kind, generous American pastor. Lastly the schoolgirls are perfect, especially the girl who plays Emily Schuyler, who lashes out her venom in a realistic way, an imitation of the genius of Miss Davis. Altogether, the casting was perfection.The screenplay was magnificent, with a touch of sentiment and heartfelt emotions. Get it if you want to see another side of Bette, true acting, or just plain a STUPENDOUS movie.",5,LOVE IT...a TRUE GEM!!!

Henriette manages to bring happiness and peace to the children and by extension to their father.The story follows their growing love and the wife's growing jealousy, both of which culminate in her murder.

274682,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301963644,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I was on kind of a Bette Davis kick a few weeks ago and decided to digest a lot of her early work, and this just happened to be one of the blind spots I eliminated.  I have to say, as much as I was really excited to take this one it (Davis, Boyer, period drama, fictionalized biopic!) this one fell very flat for me.  The set pieces are exciting, the narrative is exciting and the central performances are all very well put together (especially a stunning, and chilling supporting turn by Barbara O&#8217;Neil), but something just felt so bland about this film for me.The story behind the murder of the Duchesse de Praslin and the love affair that took place between her husband and her children&#8217;s nanny is a very intriguing one, and the way that director Anatole Litvak goes about telling it should have worked, but there were so many segments here that felt stale and uninteresting.  It needed a tighter flow.  The film clocks in at almost two and a half hours, and it would have benefited from roughly thirty of those minutes trimmed.  Like I said, there is so much intrigue surrounding this story, but many of the scenes either drag on or feel unnecessary, and while I understand they are there for character development, they take us out of the story itself.I hate when I&#8217;m waiting for a film to end.That being said, there are sweeping moments that are truly breathtaking, and from a technical angle the film is stunning to look at.  Davis is always on point (at least mostly always) and here is no exception.  She handles every angle of this woman&#8217;s life with such ease and creates a backstory that didn&#8217;t need all the external explanations to make it work.  Boyer is a delightful presence for me (I really love him), but the film belongs to Barbara O&#8217;Neil.  She has the meatiest role (villain/victim/suffering spouse) and she certainly milks every scene she&#8217;s in.  You can&#8217;t take your eyes off of her!I wanted to love this movie.  It seemed right up my alley, but the more that I&#8217;ve rested on the film the more I just can&#8217;t help but not want to ever watch it again.",3,"Next time, trim the fat&#8230;",1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,2126,"['was', 'kind', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'decided', 'digest', 'lot', 'early', 'work', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'one', 'blind', 'spots', 'eliminated', 'have', 'say', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'take', 'one', 'Davis', 'Boyer', 'period', 'drama', 'fictionalized', 'biopic', 'one', 'fell', 'very', 'flat', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'exciting', 'narrative', 'exciting', 'central', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'especially', 'stunning', 'chilling', 'supporting', 'turn', 'Barbara', 'O', '8217', 'Neil', 'something', 'just', 'felt', 'so', 'bland', 'film', 'me.The', 'story', 'murder', 'Duchesse', 'de', 'Praslin', 'love', 'affair', 'took', 'place', 'husband', 'children', '8217', 'nanny', 'very', 'intriguing', 'one', 'way', 'director', 'Anatole', 'Litvak', 'telling', 'should', 'have', 'worked', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'segments', 'here', 'felt', 'stale', 'uninteresting', 'needed', 'tighter', 'flow', 'film', 'clocks', 'almost', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'roughly', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'trimmed', 'said', 'so', 'much', 'intrigue', 'surrounding', 'story', 'many', 'scenes', 'drag', 'feel', 'unnecessary', 'understand', 'are', 'there', 'character', 'development', 'take', 'story', 'itself.I', 'hate', 'when', '8217', 'waiting', 'film', 'end.That', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'sweeping', 'moments', 'are', 'truly', 'breathtaking', 'technical', 'angle', 'film', 'stunning', 'look', 'Davis', 'always', 'point', 'least', 'mostly', 'always', 'here', 'exception', 'angle', 'woman', '8217', 's', 'life', 'such', 'ease', 'backstory', '8217', 'need', 'external', 'explanations', 'make', 'work', 'Boyer', 'delightful', 'presence', 'really', 'love', 'film', 'belongs', 'Barbara', 'O', '8217', 'Neil', 'meatiest', 'role', 'villain/victim/suffering', 'spouse', 'certainly', 'scene', '8217', 's', 'can', '8217', 't', 'take', 'eyes', 'wanted', 'love', 'movie', 'seemed', 'right', 'alley', 'more', '8217', 'rested', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'not', 'want', 'ever', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

Davis plays a governess in 1840s France to the 4 children of Charles Boyer, a duke. Boyer's wife (Barbara O'Neill) is insanely jealous and insufferable and imagines an affair between Boyer and Davis; they do grow to love each other but it's purely platonic. But Boyer, driven mad finally by his wife's hatred, kills her, and Davis is implicated. Boyer takes poison rather than being forced to declare his true feelings, thus ""proving"" Davis's guilt in complicity. The picture goes on for over 140 minutes and becomes a drag, though Davis and Boyer play their parts well. (Davis was always a trooper in this kind of role.)

274685,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6301963644,Byron Kolln,"[7, 7]","Based on the historical, fact-based book by Rachel Field, 1940's ALL THIS, AND HEAVEN TOO was Warner's prestige picture that year, geared as a showcase for their leading female star Bette Davis.In 1840's France, young governess Henriette Deluzy-Desportes (Bette Davis) enters the employ of the Duc and Duchesse de Praslin (Charles Boyer and Barbara O'Neil).  There she falls in love, first with the delightful de Praslin children, and again with the Duc himself.  Disgusted and repulsed by his shrewish, zealot of a wife, the Duc greatly admires Henriette for her love and devotion to the children.  Together they slowly create a private relationship which is never acted upon, though does ultimately ruin the de Praslin family, when Henriette is asked to leave in disgrace without references, and the Duc finally snaps...Based on a real case of the period (which directly led to the toppling of the July Monarchy), ALL THIS, AND HEAVEN TOO is a good example of how wonderfully restained Ms Davis could be when the character required it.  Henriette is one of her finer performances from the period.  Dreamy, handsome Charles Boyer can make anyone go weak at the knees and some of his close-ups in this movie are to die for.  Barbara O'Neil (best-remembered for playing the dignified O'Hara matriarch in ""Gone with the Wind"" the previous year), chews the scenery in her tour-de-force, Academy Award-nominated turn as the Duchesse.I must also mention the actors who played the de Praslin children, as they create some wonderful performances but yet are hardly mentioned in any review.  June Lockhart, Virginia Weidler, Ann E. Todd and Richard Nichols are a pleasure to watch in every scene in which they appear.  Little Richard Nichols would later tug at heartstrings again in 1941's Technicolor tearjerker ""Blossoms in the Dust"".For Bette Davis fans, this is a no-brainer.

The appeal they have to one-an-other other is enormous but because of the circumstances in which they live, they can`t give in to their feelings.  He is a grand duke in the French Court, she is the governess of his childrem.  His wife is a vitriolic, spiteful and an extraordinarily jealous woman, throwing out wild accusations and making life unbearable for everyone except her spies and servants.  She has no interest in her children.  She cares only for her husband but has driven him away with her terrible possesiveness.This role, amazeingly, is not played by Bette Davis but by Barbara O`Neill who played Scarlett O`Hara`s mother in `Gone with the Wind`.  Instead Bette Davis is the the gentle, loving and well loved governess of the four children.  The peace that she brings to the house is in stark contrast to the screaming and tears that were part of their lives before her arrival.  To the Duke, the governess is his refuge and they become very much in love.  The tension that this creates gets stronger in every scene they have together.  Two wonderful actors giving great performances.I believe this film was Warner Brothers answer to GWTW.  It was shot in black and white because off the sombre nature of the story.

Not that I don't like Rebecca, but... that's beside the point...Bette Davis plays Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, who is a sweet, kind governess to three girls and a boy, the children of the Duc and Duchesse du Praslin. I do like Bette in roles such as these, much better than the hard, scheming, or vicious woman she has the reputation of being. This is a sweet, chaste, hopeless love story between the Duc and Henriette, and the jealous, neurotic wife who completes the triangle. (The jealous, neurotic wife is the same lady who played Ellen O'Hara in Gone With the Wind. Now I will never look at Ellen O'Hara the same way again.) At first I thought it strange that the film did not probe more into la Duchesse's character to explain why she was a jealous, neurotic wife - but then, the story is told from Henriette's perspective, and I don't think she really understood the jealous, neurotic wife either.You gotta love Bette's hair in this movie. I mean - it looks like someone sculpted it over her ears just so with hairspray. But the lovely dresses make up for the weird hair. All except the one she wore to the theatre with the huge ruffled flower on the front. And the children are all quite sweet. I've always enjoyed Virginia Weidler whenever I have seen her, and the little boy was an angel too. Charles Boyer's voice... Let's just say I dig the guys with the accents, Paul Henreid and Peter O'Toole among others.The first time I watched this, I thought that the Duc's suicide at the end was a bit too melodramatic after all the more realistic drama that preceded it, and I didn't understand why he had to kill his wife either. A moment of violent passion, I suppose. Still, with Henriette, you come to love him so much that although you dislike these aspects, you can't hate him for it either. But the book says this is what happened, and that makes it more believable.Speaking of the book, I recently read it - same title, and by Rachel Field. I recommend reading that along with watching this movie. Basically the movie adheres to the book, except that the book has a lot more after the film ends, and some of the scenes are switched around a bit.Overall I thought this a very engaging, almost perfect film.

274690,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6301963644,Douglas M,"[12, 13]","""All This and Heaven Too"", released in 1940, is a long and moving film concerning a famous murder within the French aristocracy. Made at the height of Bette Davis's career at Warner Brothers, it is most noteworthy today for the underacting of Davis, in contrast to her many much more dynamic and exciting characterisations. This is one of the films which counters Davis's mainly false reputation for overacting. Matched with Charles Boyer, an equally magnetic and powerful actor, the pair create a deeply felt relationship conveyed mainly in close up. Anatole Litvak directs meticulously and the film is a triumph of studio magic but the length tends to induce boredom today.The print of the film is first rate and there is a comprehensive package of extras. Two trailers are included, one for the film itself and the other for ""Dr Erlich's Magic Bullet"", carefully promoted as another example of Warner's leadership in breaking new ground for the film was about finding a cure for syphilis. The Newsreel shows Ed Sullivan crowning Davis and Mickey Rooney as king and queen of Hollywood in 1940 and the technicolour short is a patriotic recruiting poster for the Navy - beautifully made but hard not to cringe today.

274692,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,6301963644,elena maria vidal,"[2, 2]","Most books are better than their film renditions, with a few exceptions. I personally enjoy the movie based upon Rachel Field's ""All This and Heaven, Too"" more than I ever liked the original novel. Not that the book is dull; it is based upon a true event. Rachel's great uncle married the infamous Henriette Deluzy-Desportes. Mademoiselle Deluzy was accused of complicity in a murder which rocked France and ignited the Revolution of 1848. After her release from the Conciergerie she fled to America where she married the Protestant minister Mr. Field.The film, however, brings all the characters and their vying passions to life far better than does the novel. Charles Boyer wavers on the brink of insanity as the honorable but tormented Duc de Choiseul-Praslin. Scion of an ancient but impoverished family, the Duc has married the nouvelle-riche Fanny Sebastiani, daughter of one of Napoleon's generals. Barbara O'Neill, who played Scarlett O'Hara's saintly and refined mother, demonstrates her range as the hysterical, paranoid, oversexed Fanny, dripping with venom and religiosity. She would have stolen the show from any other female actress but Bette Davis. Bette is the restrained Huguenot governess Mademoiselle Deluzy, who brings order and dignity into the chaotic household, winning the hearts of the Duc and his children, thus earning for herself the Fanny's hatred. Davis simmers along as Mademoiselle Deluzy, who must face the stigma of sins she did not commit for, as so often happens, people are more incensed by the platonic friendship between the Duc and the governess than they would have been by a full blown love affair. Perhaps it is because such romantic but chaste relationships are sometimes more intense and longer lasting than sexual flings.At any rate, Henriette pays a high price for the Duc's admiration and devotion. It is a most bitter tragedy, made all the more so by the reality of the actual story. The family of the Duc de Praslin-Choiseul was destroyed by Fanny's violent murder. Henriette found peace in a faraway land, where she passed on the story which became an American novel and classic film.",5,This is one film which surpasses the original book,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,2135,"['Most', 'books', 'are', 'better', 'film', 'renditions', 'few', 'exceptions', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'based', 'Rachel', 'Field', 'Heaven', 'Too', 'more', 'ever', 'liked', 'original', 'novel', 'Not', 'book', 'dull', 'based', 'true', 'event', 'Rachel', 'great', 'uncle', 'married', 'infamous', 'Henriette', 'Deluzy-Desportes', 'Mademoiselle', 'Deluzy', 'was', 'accused', 'complicity', 'murder', 'rocked', 'France', 'ignited', 'Revolution', '1848', 'release', 'Conciergerie', 'fled', 'America', 'where', 'married', 'Protestant', 'minister', 'Mr.', 'Field.The', 'film', 'however', 'characters', 'vying', 'passions', 'life', 'far', 'better', 'novel', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'wavers', 'brink', 'insanity', 'honorable', 'tormented', 'Duc', 'Choiseul-Praslin', 'Scion', 'ancient', 'impoverished', 'family', 'Duc', 'married', 'nouvelle-riche', 'Fanny', 'Sebastiani', 'daughter', 'one', 'Napoleon', 'generals', 'Barbara', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'played', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'saintly', 'refined', 'mother', 'range', 'hysterical', 'paranoid', 'oversexed', 'Fanny', 'dripping', 'venom', 'religiosity', 'would', 'have', 'stolen', 'show', 'other', 'female', 'actress', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Bette', 'restrained', 'Huguenot', 'governess', 'Mademoiselle', 'Deluzy', 'who', 'order', 'dignity', 'chaotic', 'household', 'winning', 'hearts', 'Duc', 'children', 'thus', 'earning', 'Fanny', 'hatred', 'Davis', 'simmers', 'along', 'Mademoiselle', 'Deluzy', 'who', 'must', 'face', 'stigma', 'sins', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'so', 'often', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'incensed', 'platonic', 'friendship', 'Duc', 'governess', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'full', 'blown', 'love', 'affair', 'Perhaps', 'such', 'romantic', 'chaste', 'relationships', 'are', 'sometimes', 'more', 'intense', 'longer', 'lasting', 'sexual', 'flings.At', 'rate', 'Henriette', 'high', 'price', 'Duc', 'admiration', 'devotion', 'most', 'bitter', 'tragedy', 'made', 'more', 'so', 'reality', 'actual', 'story', 'family', 'Duc', 'Praslin-Choiseul', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Fanny', 'violent', 'murder', 'Henriette', 'found', 'peace', 'faraway', 'land', 'where', 'passed', 'story', 'became', 'American', 'novel', 'classic', 'film']",N/A

The Duc and Duchesse are at war with each other, trying to keep the children out of it.  Davis' calm manner and way with the children soon catches the eye of the doting father, Charles Boyer, leading to a love between the two that is never acted upon.  The Duchesse, Barbara O'Neill, grows to resent the governess for having taken the affections of her husband and children from her.

For those who think Bette Davis did nothing but flounce around throwing herself into every scene she played, this is a totally different type of role for her and she is wonderful in it. Of course I love to see her in the other roles too. What amazes me is that for a woman with a not very pretty face and not a very good figure she can convince her audience that she is, indeed, a beautiful woman. I was never a fan of Charles Boyer, considering him to be just ""too much,"" usually but in this film he underplays the French charm beautifully. His eyes say it all and there has never been anything more moving on film than his deathbed scene. The commentary is actually pretty good in the special features but I wondered why nothing was ever mentioned about the middle daughter's beginnings of the same type of manic behavior that was so evident in her mother. I did not read the book so perhaps this was a subtle addition by the director. If that was his intention, he did a very good job of it as did the actress playing the role. Even the slightly hysterical glint in her eyes at times reminded me so much of the mother.  I love the lighting in B&W movies. There is one scene where they somehow managed to put the dark silouettes of both Davis and Boyer one above the other in a doorway with the light from the hall. Just amazingly effective. How wonderful it is to see two people so obviously in love but nothing is ever said or done except the wonderful facial expressions and the look in their eyes. For anyone who loves old B&W movies this is one of the best I've ever seen. To be looked at many times. I do, however, have the continuing question ""where on earth did that title come from?"" I guess my other question is how Barbara O'Neil got cast so much as a beautiful woman with that acne scarred face. It shows up on the big screen in spite of all the makeup they put on her.  The only other actress I remember having so many acne scars was Sherrie North. Of course I guess that was before dermabrazion was ever heard of. DOn't miss this movie.

The Duc's jealous wife has always made his life difficult and the presence of the pretty, young governess brings their marriage to the boiling point. The Duc's children soon adore Henriette and he grows close to her, too, but does he feel gratitude for a job well done or is he falling in love with her?This romance/murder was based on a true story which was instrumental in bringing about the French Revolution of 1848.  The movie is generally entertaining but falls short in several areas.  First, the cast all overact so much that it quickly becomes soap-opera/melodrama.  The costumes and interior sets are elegant,  but the exteriors are cheap fakes.  The movie is 30 minutes too long and consists mostly of exaggerated, grand speeches that aren't at all realistic.

I almost didn't watch this film until my grandmother recommended it to me.  Bette Davis shines in this wonderfully impressive role as a governess full of love, patience and mercy.  Very different from her other roles, where being in the spotlight and causing trouble were paramount.The movie begins with her teaching at a school for girls, where, upon learning some gossip about Bette, treat her awfully.  Instead of giving up or turning to harsh tactics to control her class, she arrives one morning, and announces that she wants to tell them a story.  Then after hearing her story, they can each be the judge, to decide if she is fit to teach them.The story is one that you will not walk away from without feeling like you never want it to end.  It's the kind of story that will have you so involved, it's like you yourself have been transported to France, that you are the governess, living out this story as if it were real.

274708,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6301963644,Lawyeraau,"[51, 51]","Based upon Rachel Field's wonderful novel of the same name, this film is a triumph. It is a fictionalized account of a notorious true crime that shocked Paris to its core in the mid nineteenth century.A governess, Henriette Deluzy, magnificently played by Bette Davis, returns to France, having accepted a position to teach the four children of the Duc and Duchesse De Praslin. The Duc, played with intense, restrained passion by the debonair Charles Boyer, is unhappily married to a self absorbed harpy who cares not a whit for her children, but is obsessed with her husband. Her obsession is such, that she appears to be mentally unbalanced.When Ms. Deluzy joins the household, the Duchesse resents her children's growing fondness of her, as well as her husband's attentions to the children and the governess. Though clearly falling in love, the Duc and the governess maintain a completely platonic relationship at all times. Yet, the obsession of the Duchesse is such that she imagines the worst sort of affair is taking place right under her very nose. She is consumed by jealously and loses no time in making all in that household miserable.Many months after Ms. Deluzy is forced to leave the household, the Duchesse is found murdered, and suspicion falls upon the Duc and the former governess. What happens to them will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. This is a beautifully acted film.Bette Davis, the great doyenne of film and theatre, plays the governess in an uncharacteristally restrained fashion, using those famous orbs of hers to convey all the emotion that she feels but cannot express. She succeeds, brilliantly. Charles Boyer is a superb casting choice for the handsome, angst ridden Duc, saddled with a histrionic wife bent on making the entire family miserable. Barbara O'Neil, as the Duchesse, gives an over the top, but effective, performance that is a good counterfoil to that of Ms. Davis. The supporting cast is likewise excellent and contributes to the success of this marvelous screen gem.This tragic story is brought to life under the very able direction of Anatole Litvak and rightly earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It is a true film classic that should be seen by all who love a great movie.",5,THOSE BETTE DAVIS EYES WILL GET YOU EVERY TIME...,1001980800,"10 2, 2001",2001,2247,"['Based', 'Rachel', 'Field', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'triumph', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'notorious', 'true', 'crime', 'shocked', 'Paris', 'core', 'mid', 'nineteenth', 'century.A', 'governess', 'Henriette', 'Deluzy', 'magnificently', 'played', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'France', 'having', 'accepted', 'position', 'teach', 'four', 'children', 'Duc', 'Duchesse', 'De', 'Praslin', 'Duc', 'played', 'intense', 'restrained', 'passion', 'debonair', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'unhappily', 'married', 'self', 'absorbed', 'harpy', 'who', 'not', 'whit', 'children', 'obsessed', 'husband', 'obsession', 'such', 'be', 'mentally', 'unbalanced.When', 'Ms.', 'Deluzy', 'household', 'Duchesse', 'children', 'growing', 'fondness', 'as', 'well', 'husband', 'attentions', 'children', 'governess', 'clearly', 'falling', 'love', 'Duc', 'governess', 'maintain', 'completely', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'times', 'obsession', 'Duchesse', 'such', 'worst', 'sort', 'affair', 'taking', 'place', 'right', 'very', 'nose', 'consumed', 'jealously', 'time', 'making', 'household', 'miserable.Many', 'months', 'Ms.', 'Deluzy', 'forced', 'leave', 'household', 'Duchesse', 'found', 'murdered', 'suspicion', 'Duc', 'former', 'governess', 'What', 'will', 'keep', 'viewer', 'riveted', 'screen', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'film.Bette', 'Davis', 'great', 'doyenne', 'film', 'theatre', 'governess', 'uncharacteristally', 'restrained', 'fashion', 'using', 'famous', 'orbs', 'hers', 'convey', 'emotion', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'brilliantly', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'superb', 'casting', 'choice', 'handsome', 'angst', 'ridden', 'Duc', 'saddled', 'histrionic', 'wife', 'bent', 'making', 'entire', 'family', 'miserable', 'Barbara', ""O'Neil"", 'Duchesse', 'top', 'effective', 'performance', 'good', 'counterfoil', 'Ms.', 'Davis', 'supporting', 'cast', 'likewise', 'excellent', 'success', 'marvelous', 'screen', 'gem.This', 'tragic', 'story', 'brought', 'life', 'very', 'able', 'direction', 'Anatole', 'Litvak', 'rightly', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Picture', 'true', 'film', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'who', 'love', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

274712,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,6301963644,octobercountry,"[0, 0]","Well, I&#8217;ve watched a number of Crawford films lately and thought perhaps I&#8217;d better give Bette Davis her fair due as well, so I&#8217;ve just viewed &#34;All This and Heaven Too&#34; (1940).Eh, I really wouldn&#8217;t call this a &#8220;romantic drama&#8221; at all (as the official blurb does); it certainly isn&#8217;t romantic in the typical sense, and in fact contains elements of a &#8220;true crime drama&#8221; (which is NOT what you&#8217;d think of when you think of &#8220;romance&#8221;).Bette Davis was already well-established as one of Hollywood&#8217;s preeminent actresses by 1940; the &#8220;golden age&#8221; of her career dates from the mid 1930s through the mid 1940s. During that decade she made quite a few really excellent pictures, and it is those films that form the bedrock of her lasting reputation.Now, by the time this picture was shot she already was well known for playing really nasty characters---this probably all started back in 1934 with her performance as Mildred in &#34;Of Human Bondage.&#34; By 1940 her acting style also incorporated all the famous mannerisms and quirks that she fell back on more and more in her later years. However, in All This and Heaven Too she sets all that aside and gives a more subtle and nuanced performance as the quiet, self-effacing governess Henriette Deluzy-Desportes.This isn&#8217;t my favourite Davis picture, not by a long shot---it runs a little long and doesn&#8217;t hold my attention as much as some of her more lively performances. Still, it is a good picture and one that every fan of classic cinema should view at least once.Adding a little interest to the tale is the fact that it is based on a true-life story, one which had national implications at the time and was quite the scandal back in the 1840s. There were at least two books written about the case: the novel by Rachael Field which shares the title of the film (and which of course the film was based upon), and &#34;A Crime of Passion&#34; by Stanley Loomis, which takes a more clinical approach to the details of the case. From what I understand---I still haven&#8217;t read the Loomis book---the true life story still has some unanswered questions attached to the case, and there are also hints that many aspects of the actual events were in fact much more unsavory than what is depicted on the screen.So---I&#8217;d recommend this one for classic movie fans and Davis fans. But if you&#8217;re not all that familiar with the work of the actress, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d start with this picture---try some of her other classics like &#34;Now Voyager&#34; or &#34;The Letter&#34; or &#34;The Little Foxes.&#34;",4,Still one of the classic Davis films,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,2675,"['Well', '8217', 've', 'watched', 'number', 'Crawford', 'films', 'lately', 'thought', 'perhaps', '8217', 'd', 'better', 'give', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'fair', 'due', 'as', 'well', '8217', 've', 'just', 'viewed', '34', 'Heaven', 'Too', '34', '1940', '.Eh', 'really', 'wouldn', '8217', 'call', '8220', 'romantic', 'drama', '8221', 'official', 'blurb', 'certainly', '8217', 'romantic', 'typical', 'sense', 'fact', 'elements', '8220', 'true', 'crime', 'drama', '8221', 'NOT', 'what', '8217', 'd', 'think', 'when', 'think', '8220', 'romance', '8221', '.Bette', 'Davis', 'was', 'already', 'well-established', 'one', 'Hollywood', '8217', 'preeminent', 'actresses', '1940', '8220', 'golden', 'age', '8221', 'career', 'dates', 'mid', '1930s', 'mid', '1940s', 'decade', 'made', 'quite', 'few', 'really', 'excellent', 'pictures', 'films', 'form', 'bedrock', 'lasting', 'reputation.Now', 'time', 'picture', 'was', 'shot', 'already', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'playing', 'really', 'nasty', 'characters', '-this', 'probably', 'started', 'back', '1934', 'performance', 'Mildred', '34', 'Human', 'Bondage.', '34', '1940', 'acting', 'style', 'also', 'incorporated', 'famous', 'mannerisms', 'quirks', 'fell', 'back', 'more', 'more', 'later', 'years', 'However', 'Heaven', 'Too', 'aside', 'more', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'quiet', 'self-effacing', 'governess', 'Henriette', 'Deluzy-Desportes.This', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'favourite', 'Davis', 'picture', 'not', 'long', 'shot', '-it', 'little', 'long', 'doesn', '8217', 'hold', 'attention', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'lively', 'performances', 'Still', 'good', 'picture', 'one', 'fan', 'classic', 'cinema', 'should', 'view', 'least', 'once.Adding', 'little', 'interest', 'tale', 'fact', 'based', 'true-life', 'story', 'one', 'had', 'national', 'implications', 'time', 'was', 'quite', 'scandal', 'back', '1840s', 'were', 'least', 'two', 'books', 'written', 'case', 'novel', 'Rachael', 'Field', 'shares', 'title', 'film', 'course', 'film', 'was', 'based', '34', 'Crime', 'Passion', '34', 'Stanley', 'Loomis', 'more', 'clinical', 'approach', 'details', 'case', 'what', 'understand', '-I', 'still', 'haven', '8217', 'read', 'Loomis', 'book', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'still', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'attached', 'case', 'are', 'also', 'hints', 'many', 'aspects', 'actual', 'events', 'were', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'unsavory', 'what', 'depicted', 'screen.So', '-I', '8217', 'recommend', 'one', 'classic', 'movie', 'fans', 'Davis', 'fans', '8217', 'not', 'familiar', 'work', 'actress', 'don', '8217', 'think', '8217', 'd', 'start', 'picture', 'other', 'classics', '34', 'Now', 'Voyager', '34', '34', 'Letter', '34', '34', 'Little', 'Foxes.', '34']",N/A

274719,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,6301963644,"""scotsladdie""","[4, 4]","A long and moving adaptation of the once - popular novel by Rachel Field.  On August 18, 1847, the Duchesse de Praslin was found literally hacked to pieces in her bedroom. Her husband, the Duc de Praslin and the governess, Henriette Deluzy Desportes were charged with the horrendous crime, making the governess the most notorious woman in Europe. Rachel Field, Henriette's grandneice, wrote a best-selling novel in 1937 about the celebrated affair and Warners immediately bought the rights for their established star, Bette Davis. The direction by Anatole Litvak is superb. Davis maintains a surface composure covering the true feelings of her character. To suggest emotional turmoil masked by impeccably correct behaviour is a hard task with which to saddle any actress, but Bette responds superbly. Davis walks a very fine line - underplaying in such muted tones that the audience has no choice but to sympathize with her position.  In her scenes with Boyer, Bette retains an outward composure which only intensifies her real feelings, never completely expressed.  It is acting so restrained that a single overdrawn passage or expression would shatter the illusion.  The excellent cinematography is by Ernest Haller and it's appropriately shadowed, conveying just the right touch of Gothic menace while the score by Max Steiner is lushly romantic. Boyer and Davis are paired well together in this exceptional period piece from the Hollywood of 1940.",5,EXCEPTIONAL GEM FROM 1940,997315200,"08 9, 2001",2001,1451,"['long', 'moving', 'adaptation', 'once', 'popular', 'novel', 'Rachel', 'Field', 'August', '18', '1847', 'Duchesse', 'de', 'Praslin', 'was', 'found', 'literally', 'hacked', 'pieces', 'bedroom', 'husband', 'Duc', 'de', 'Praslin', 'governess', 'Henriette', 'Deluzy', 'Desportes', 'were', 'charged', 'horrendous', 'crime', 'making', 'governess', 'most', 'notorious', 'woman', 'Europe', 'Rachel', 'Field', 'Henriette', 'grandneice', 'wrote', 'best-selling', 'novel', '1937', 'celebrated', 'affair', 'Warners', 'immediately', 'bought', 'rights', 'established', 'star', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'direction', 'Anatole', 'Litvak', 'superb', 'Davis', 'surface', 'composure', 'covering', 'true', 'feelings', 'character', 'suggest', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'masked', 'impeccably', 'correct', 'behaviour', 'hard', 'task', 'saddle', 'actress', 'Bette', 'superbly', 'Davis', 'very', 'fine', 'line', 'underplaying', 'such', 'muted', 'tones', 'audience', 'choice', 'sympathize', 'position', 'scenes', 'Boyer', 'Bette', 'outward', 'composure', 'only', 'real', 'feelings', 'never', 'completely', 'expressed', 'acting', 'so', 'restrained', 'single', 'overdrawn', 'passage', 'expression', 'would', 'shatter', 'illusion', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'Ernest', 'Haller', 'appropriately', 'shadowed', 'conveying', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'Gothic', 'menace', 'score', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'lushly', 'romantic', 'Boyer', 'Davis', 'are', 'paired', 'well', 'together', 'exceptional', 'period', 'piece', 'Hollywood', '1940']",N/A
274720,ANEDXRFDZDL18,6301963644,Serene Night,"[3, 3]","This was a poignant film about a young noblewoman Henriette of illegitimate birth, who becomes a governess for a rich French duke's 4 children. The  Duc de Praslin (Boyer) is quite handsome and kindly, and loves his children, while the wife is obsessive, possessive and clearly mentally ill. Henriette, tries very hard to educate the children, and keep them safe, but finds herself in a difficult position. Unreasonably hated by the duchess, she befriends the duke, and grows quite attracted to him.. They never consummate this attraction, despite the shrill and haranguing wife.This was an enjoyable film, although I admit, the ending was sad. The acting was superb, particularly good were Boyer and the children.This is based on a true crime, believe it or not, however in real life the duke has 10 children.",5,Superb,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,810,"['was', 'poignant', 'film', 'young', 'noblewoman', 'Henriette', 'illegitimate', 'birth', 'who', 'governess', 'rich', 'French', 'duke', '4', 'children', 'Duc', 'de', 'Praslin', 'Boyer', 'quite', 'handsome', 'kindly', 'children', 'wife', 'obsessive', 'possessive', 'clearly', 'mentally', 'ill.', 'Henriette', 'very', 'hard', 'educate', 'children', 'keep', 'safe', 'difficult', 'position', 'Unreasonably', 'hated', 'duchess', 'duke', 'quite', 'attracted', 'him..', 'never', 'consummate', 'attraction', 'shrill', 'haranguing', 'wife.This', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'admit', 'ending', 'was', 'sad', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'particularly', 'good', 'were', 'Boyer', 'children.This', 'based', 'true', 'crime', 'believe', 'not', 'however', 'real', 'life', 'duke', '10', 'children']",N/A

This particular one I think was her best as far as acting goes. She seemed quite human, not over the top. The storyline itself, being somewhat based on fact made the movie all the more interesting in my opinion!It was a sad movie in a lot of ways, showing what can happen between people thrown together because of money (Duke and Duchess) verses love. The Duchess definitely has a personality disorder. She's very jealous of EVERYONE and fearful of losing her husband. If she were alive today, I think she would be treated for Borderline Personality Disorder. Being alive at a time where woman weren't viewed as that important probably didn't help her much.Of course your heart breaks for the Duke and the children, and Bette Davis as the Governess. The child who played the little boy Raynaud, absolutely stole my heart with his big eyes, and curly hair. I had never seen June Lockhart as a young girl acting, but she is the eldest sister in the movie.I must say I loved this movie from beginning to end, and even had to wipe away a few tears by the end. If you love Bette Davis movies, don't miss out on this one.
