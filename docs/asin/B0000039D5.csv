The story is believable and the characters all seem to be like someone we know. Patrick Duffy of Dallas fame, is as always a wonderful ""dad"". This movie is all about love and family values. If you don't like to watch movies that speak about family commitment, love between father and children then this movie isn't for you. There are plenty of tears and heart felt moments from beginning to end. This movie isn't about it's women. Instead it shows us the pain and joys that go inside a man's heart. Sensitive and kind men I may add. The type of men women are always trying to find but never seem to get their hands on. As for BEN AFFLECK... this movie is a MUST SEE for all his fans. He delivers such a powerful performance that it is touching. Note the young actor was only 17 years old when he made this movie, though he already had the good looks he has today. The ONLY problem with this VHS tape is it's video and sound quality. The movie was taped in EP mode (the slowest recording velocity possible) and consequently the image isn't good and the sound only plays clearly on a stereo VCR. I still would buy it for BEN AFFLECK'S work though. By the way, he appears in almost every scene, his character is not a small one. You can say that he shares with Patrick Duffy the lead male role. As a matter of fact, I loved this movie so much that I will be more than happy to buy it on DVD if it ever comes out!Edited to add on July 30 2005: The DVD finally came out and I already bought it.

489936,AZ914SGGSHOL,B0000039D5,A. Simpkins,"[1, 4]","Being a fan of Patrick Duffy this movie sure locked that feeling in good. Danielle Steele wrote a wonderful story that took a mans view of a marriage gone sour. Which is rare to see. As when this came out in the early 90's things have certainly changed a lot. Attitudes about marriage and women are so different now. But, the romance was captured in this film. Patrick Duffy gave the character ""Oliver"" a personality that we can feel. He was touching and made you feel for him. You just wanted to reach out to ""Oliver"" and tell him all will be ok. Only a very good actor can do that and his talent shines. Featured was a young Ben Affleck who surprisingly looks the same and still acts they same! Lynda Carter however acted too desperate in this movie and you sort of wish they cast someone else. She is pretty and had the star look for the role but, her acting was disappointing. Overall it was Patrick Duffy who certainly carried the story and I just only wish it lasted a little longer and focused more on his new relationship.

489944,A102B9E558OGMD,B0000039D5,M. Carlson,"[0, 0]","Danielle Steel's Daddy is a decent movie. I've reviewed another one of Steel's movies online before and I have to say that this is pretty much the same fare as all of the other films of this same genre. Melodrama and semi-decent acting are are thrown together in this made-for-tv movie.Patrick Duffy of 'Step by Step' and 'Dallas' fame plays Oliver Watson and wife Sarah is played by Kate Mulgrew pre-Star Trek Voyager. We also get to see a young Ben Affleck in one of his first roles, playing Oliver and Sarah's son Ben Watson.Sarah feels trapped in her upper-middle class lifestyle. Stifled, she asks Oliver out to dinner and drops a bombshell on him. She wants to go back to college and finish her degree. She needs to 'find herself,' away from the kids and from Oliver. After spending Christmas with the family, her plans firm for her future, Oliver realizes that he has to do something or his family will break apart. In desperation, he makes love to his wife and she, while showing passion for him, still forsakes him and leaves.Meanwhile there is a subplot involving Ben Watson the son. He rebels against everything and ends up getting his girlfriend pregnant. Part of the movie revolves around his trials of learning how to be a father, especially when his girlfriend leaves him.Deciding that they need to start over again, Oliver packs up the family and moves them to Hollywood. There predictably he meets someone-- beautiful actress Charlotte Sampson (Linda Carter) and begins to fall in love with her. He at first is unwilling to trust, but Charlotte makes it easy for Oliver.This movie had all the expected twists. Honestly, I bought this movie for Kate Mulgrew, being that she is one of my favorite actresses. She doesn't actually have that much screen time, but her part, while small is meaningful. Kate Mulgrew does some of the best acting in this film.Lynda Carter is a great actress, but somehow I wasn't convinced of the 'love' between she and her costar Patrick Duffy. They had horrible chemistry. Again, at times, their love seemed forced.For the money though, it's worth the buy. I believe I only ended up paying about five dollars for a film and if you have time on your hands and you need something to do, this movie is worth at least one view.",3,A Moderately Good Film that Passes Time,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,2267,"['Danielle', 'Steel', 'Daddy', 'decent', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'one', 'Steel', 'movies', 'online', 'have', 'say', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'fare', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'genre', 'Melodrama', 'semi-decent', 'acting', 'are', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'made-for-tv', 'movie.Patrick', 'Duffy', ""'Step"", 'Step', ""'Dallas"", 'fame', 'Oliver', 'Watson', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'played', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'pre-Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'young', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'playing', 'Oliver', 'Sarah', 'son', 'Ben', 'Watson.Sarah', 'feels', 'trapped', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'lifestyle', 'Stifled', 'out', 'dinner', 'drops', 'bombshell', 'go', 'back', 'college', 'finish', 'degree', ""'find"", 'away', 'kids', 'Oliver', 'spending', 'Christmas', 'family', 'plans', 'firm', 'future', 'Oliver', 'do', 'something', 'family', 'will', 'break', 'apart', 'desperation', 'love', 'wife', 'showing', 'passion', 'still', 'leaves.Meanwhile', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Ben', 'Watson', 'son', 'everything', 'up', 'getting', 'girlfriend', 'pregnant', 'Part', 'movie', 'trials', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'father', 'especially', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'him.Deciding', 'need', 'start', 'over', 'again', 'Oliver', 'up', 'family', 'Hollywood', 'predictably', 'someone', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'Charlotte', 'Sampson', 'Linda', 'Carter', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'unwilling', 'trust', 'Charlotte', 'easy', 'Oliver.This', 'movie', 'had', 'expected', 'twists', 'Honestly', 'bought', 'movie', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'being', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'part', 'small', 'meaningful', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'best', 'acting', 'film.Lynda', 'Carter', 'great', 'actress', 'somehow', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', ""'love"", 'costar', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'had', 'horrible', 'chemistry', 'Again', 'times', 'love', 'seemed', 'money', 'buy', 'believe', 'only', 'ended', 'up', 'paying', 'five', 'dollars', 'film', 'have', 'time', 'hands', 'need', 'something', 'do', 'movie', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'view']",Danielle Steel's Daddy VHS
