63001,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783230389,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 8]","PLEASE NOTE:In preparing to write my own review for this film I happened to read The New Yorker's review posted on this site and realized that it took the words right out of my mouth, so please, forgive me if this sounds a tad repetitious.On with the review...I finally got around to watching `Jungle Fever' last week.  I have to admit that all week I've been singing `Jungle Fever' to just about everyone I see, and at times even to myself (that song is just so catchy) but when it came to actually dissecting the film I realized that as a whole there isn't much to remember.  Knowing that the basis of this film is a heated affair between a married black man and his white (Italian) co-worker you'd think that there would be a lot to write home about, but the affair is really only here to spark heated debate about whether or not the white women are stealing the black men.  Once Flipper (yeah, that's his `real' name) and Angela `do the deed' they seem to become detached and uninterested with one another and the film spars off in another direction completely.Spike Lee has always been a director for racial controversy, and for the most part his studies work (they tower above the mediocrity that is Tyler Perry, that's for sure) but `Jungle Fever' seems to get lost in its own opinions and ideals.  Lee doesn't seem to be able to transfer his feelings on the subject of `race relations' in a coherent and tactful way.  Everyone's conversations on the matter are completely one sided and only prove to further embellish stereotypes, which is not something I expect from Spike Lee's work.In moments, `Jungle Fever' reaches `Crash' depths of racial shallowness.  What `Jungle Fever' does have on its side is its age.  Whereas `Crash' was trying to paint every situation as racism in a time that has advanced so much in that department, `Jungle Fever' has the advantage of being from a time (early 90's) when racism was a lot more prevalent and so when Flipper is passed over for partner because of his skin color it is believable.That said; it still tends to go a little too far in moments.In fact, when you remove the stereotypes and racial approach to the film you find the most intriguing and effective aspect of the film; Flipper's brother Gator (I know, seriously?).  Gator is a crackhead living on the street and constantly taking advantage of his family.  While his story has nothing to do with `interracial dating' he actually makes the loudest statement in the film.  In fact, his subplot is by far the most interesting, and his interactions with his mother and Flipper are the highlights of the film.The performances here are also very well done.  Samuel L. Jackson is the scene stealer (and really should have been Oscar nominated for this) as Gator.  He has a difficult job of making his `humorous' character more than just a walking clich&eacute;, and he does just so (especially as his characters sub-plot reaches its climax).  Ruby Dee is also magnificent as Lucinda, Gator and Flipper's mother.  The scene at the dinner table with Flipper and Angie is brilliant, especially when she leaves to breakdown in the kitchen.  John Turturro and Frank Vincent and Anthony Quinn and Veronica Webb all deliver memorable supporting performances and Lonette McKee is sympathetic as Flipper's jilted wife.  Spike Lee should stay behind the camera for he's not nearly as charismatic in front of it, and while Ossie Davis's character is somewhat the pinnacle of the films morale he delivers his lines in such an excruciatingly dry manor that I found him a bore.And then there is Halle Berry in one of the funniest cameo performances I've ever seen; period.That leaves us with Wesley Snipes and Annabella Sciorra, the films stars.  Snipes is not the greatest of actors.  He's an action buff who has a hard time joggling a weighty film (in my opinion obviously).  Here he does better than I expected, but not as good as he should have.  He seems almost disinterested with Angie, his eyes parading this guilt that makes his relationship with her feel forced and faux.  Sciorra was drastically different, engaging her character marvelously.  Despite the fact that Lee grew tired of the interracial relationship almost as soon as it began, Sciorra never grows tired of fleshing out her character.  Every time she is on the screen she is working it, and doing so brilliantly.The film is not a brilliant character study, but it works to a certain extent.  I don't think that it carries Lee's message in the proper way, and at times can come off amateurish in its delivery (the dialog is a mess in parts).  Some brilliant performances elevate the script, and the overall feel of the film is not one of total disappointment.  I can see why so many like this movie, but truth be told, it could have been a masterpiece.",3,Not quite catching the fever...,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,4813,"['PLEASE', 'NOTE', 'preparing', 'write', 'own', 'review', 'film', 'happened', 'read', 'New', 'Yorker', 'review', 'posted', 'site', 'realized', 'took', 'words', 'right', 'mouth', 'please', 'forgive', 'tad', 'repetitious.On', 'review', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'last', 'week', 'have', 'admit', 'week', ""'ve"", 'been', 'singing', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'just', 'everyone', 'see', 'times', 'even', 'song', 'just', 'so', 'catchy', 'when', 'came', 'actually', 'dissecting', 'film', 'realized', 'whole', ""n't"", 'much', 'remember', 'Knowing', 'basis', 'film', 'heated', 'affair', 'married', 'black', 'man', 'white', 'Italian', 'co-worker', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'write', 'home', 'affair', 'really', 'only', 'here', 'spark', 'heated', 'debate', 'not', 'white', 'women', 'are', 'stealing', 'black', 'men', 'Once', 'Flipper', 'yeah', 'real', 'name', 'Angela', 'do', 'deed', 'seem', 'become', 'detached', 'uninterested', 'one', 'film', 'off', 'direction', 'completely.Spike', 'Lee', 'always', 'been', 'director', 'racial', 'controversy', 'most', 'part', 'studies', 'work', 'tower', 'mediocrity', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'sure', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'get', 'lost', 'own', 'opinions', 'ideals', 'Lee', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'transfer', 'feelings', 'subject', 'race', 'relations', 'coherent', 'tactful', 'way', 'Everyone', 'conversations', 'matter', 'are', 'completely', 'one', 'sided', 'only', 'prove', 'further', 'embellish', 'stereotypes', 'not', 'something', 'expect', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'work.In', 'moments', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'reaches', 'Crash', 'depths', 'racial', 'shallowness', 'What', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'have', 'side', 'age', 'Whereas', 'Crash', 'was', 'trying', 'paint', 'situation', 'racism', 'time', 'advanced', 'so', 'much', 'department', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'advantage', 'being', 'time', 'early', '90', 'when', 'racism', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'prevalent', 'so', 'when', 'Flipper', 'passed', 'partner', 'skin', 'color', 'believable.That', 'said', 'still', 'go', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'moments.In', 'fact', 'when', 'remove', 'stereotypes', 'racial', 'approach', 'film', 'find', 'most', 'intriguing', 'effective', 'aspect', 'film', 'Flipper', 'brother', 'Gator', 'know', 'seriously', 'Gator', 'crackhead', 'living', 'street', 'constantly', 'taking', 'advantage', 'family', 'story', 'nothing', 'do', 'interracial', 'dating', 'actually', 'loudest', 'statement', 'film', 'fact', 'subplot', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'interactions', 'mother', 'Flipper', 'are', 'highlights', 'film.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'scene', 'stealer', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Gator', 'difficult', 'job', 'making', 'humorous', 'character', 'more', 'just', 'walking', 'clich', 'eacute', 'just', 'so', 'especially', 'characters', 'sub-plot', 'climax', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'also', 'magnificent', 'Lucinda', 'Gator', 'Flipper', 'mother', 'scene', 'dinner', 'table', 'Flipper', 'Angie', 'brilliant', 'especially', 'when', 'breakdown', 'kitchen', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Frank', 'Vincent', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Veronica', 'Webb', 'deliver', 'memorable', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Lonette', 'McKee', 'sympathetic', 'Flipper', 'jilted', 'wife', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'should', 'stay', 'camera', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'charismatic', 'front', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'character', 'somewhat', 'pinnacle', 'films', 'morale', 'lines', 'such', 'excruciatingly', 'dry', 'manor', 'found', 'bore.And', 'then', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'one', 'funniest', 'cameo', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'period.That', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'films', 'stars', 'Snipes', 'not', 'greatest', 'actors', 'action', 'buff', 'who', 'hard', 'time', 'joggling', 'weighty', 'film', 'opinion', 'obviously', 'Here', 'better', 'expected', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'almost', 'disinterested', 'Angie', 'eyes', 'parading', 'guilt', 'relationship', 'feel', 'forced', 'faux', 'Sciorra', 'was', 'drastically', 'different', 'engaging', 'character', 'marvelously', 'fact', 'Lee', 'grew', 'tired', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'began', 'Sciorra', 'never', 'tired', 'fleshing', 'out', 'character', 'Every', 'time', 'screen', 'working', 'doing', 'so', 'brilliantly.The', 'film', 'not', 'brilliant', 'character', 'study', 'certain', 'extent', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Lee', 'message', 'proper', 'way', 'times', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'amateurish', 'delivery', 'dialog', 'mess', 'parts', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'elevate', 'script', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'total', 'disappointment', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'movie', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'masterpiece']",N/A

After seeing part of this terrible, cluttered film on cable--I can see where he's coming from. I particularly felt sorry for the 2 main actors in the film, Wesley Snipes and Annabella Sciorra, their parts were terribly written resulting in caricatures.  The only saving grace of this movie was Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal as Gator, Snipes drug addict brother. That's the only reason I gave this film an extra star because if he wasn't in it, this film would be totally unwatchable!!  Lee has a tin ear for dialogue maybe he should study David Mamet or Elmore Leonard on that aspect.  There was an opportunity in the film also to comment positively on the inter-racial aspect of romance with the subplot involving John Turturro's infatuation with a Black female in the neighborhood but again Spike blew that aspect to bits on that. And as far a director of actors, he allowed the great Anthony Quinn to over-act!!  So along with ""Mo Better Blues"", I've been unable to watch a Spike Lee film in its entirety with the exception of perhaps ""Malcolm X"", ""Clockers"" & ""The 25th Hour"" (Edward Norton) but those films weren't written by Spike!!  So if you really serious about cinema, check out better directors like Bill Duke (Hoodlum), John Singleton (4Brothers, Shaft) or Carl Franklin (One False Move, Devil in Blue Dress, One True Thing).

Cheating, interracial dating, racial predjudices between white and black, between black and black and for a cherry on top they also throw in the crack epidemic.  Which I have to say that Samuel L. Jackson plays a crack head incredibly well.  And I have to also give it to Halle Berry for not always having to play the ""glamor girl"" because she got down and dirty in this one and played his crack head girl friend.  There is definately some good acting in here, also done by Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis.  Overall I think it is a good movie but what I just absoloutely hate about this movie is the scene where there are a group of black women in a room complaining about how all of the white women want to steal their men and how only light skin black women can get dates. I'm sure that you can take the scene as ""well they were just angry and venting and that was just their opinion"",  but the way it was done, in this ""forum"" type setting gave it the appearance of more than just an ""opinion"" and made it seem like it was a  factual message that the movie was trying to give out.  A message that I think is absolutely false.  Of course there are white women that like black men and there are some black men that will only choose a light black over a darker one(I know it sounds silly to even say it, but thats a whole other story  LOL), but to send the message that all white women want black men and that dark black women can't get dates is just false and misleading.  The scene would had been more effective if maybe some other black women could had been sitting there and gave some other points of view, but again, that probably wasn't the movie's aim to show all sides.  Other than that the movie is funny and serious at the same time and at times a little weird, but it is a weirdness that you can deal with.  Atleast I can.

63010,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,0783230389,Earl Hazell,"[10, 16]","I must be one of the only people who felt Spike essentially missed themark with this film, regarding the particular issue he wanted to address. The  film is altogether wonderful, even with the double plot of the main  character Wesley Snipes' brother (played by Sam L. Jackson) being an  irredemable crack addict and the resulting spiral downward.  But Spike  raised more fundamental psychological questions than he could possibly  answer by virtue of how heavy handed he seemed to be with his  delivery.Wesley plays and upwardly mobile, highly educated architect who  up until being almost forced to work with the temp assistant Annabella  Sciorra, is a model- albeit a bit shallow- African-American citizen.  He is  married, and has a wonderful romantic and tremendously healthy sexual  relationship with his wife- so much so that she must explain what all those  heated sounds of her orgasms are to their daughter, who laughs with the  naive wisdom of a child in the near presence of their hero parents'  expressions of love.  He is an important member of the architectural firm  in which he works and makes a great salary; good enough, in fact, to take  care of his wife and raise his daughter in an absolutely beautiful  brownstone in Harlem while wearing some of the most beautiful Italian suits  I have ever seen.  He is, even with the inherent dysfunction of his family  ever ready to rear its ugly head in his inner life, a walking Black  American dream (Ossie Davis plays his judgemental and sexually hypocritical  minister father; Ruby Dee his  close-your-eyes-and-take-it-for-the-good-of-your-family Minister's wife  mother; Sam Jackson the crack addict older brother).Beyond the fact that  Spike immediately began to lose me with the idea that any man could cheat  on a woman as drop-dead gorgeous as Lonette McKee (his wife) with ANYONE  for practically any reason, it just didn't make any sense for Wesley's  character to sacrifice such a uniquely semi-idyllic life for such an easily  controllable *disease* as &quot;jungle fever&quot;.  At no time was any  discord in his marriage shown or represented; again, he and his wife were  hitiin' it and hittin' it hard practically every night when they got home  from work as if they were newlyweds, and their daughter- the product of  their love- was at least eight years old.  His dissatisfaction over being  passed over at his firm from becoming partner, if anything reaffirmed and  AMPLIFIED his masculine sense of self and his abilties, as it was made  pretty clear that it was the stupidity and latent racism of his bosses that  were the only factors behind holding him back, not any lack of talent or  integrity. (There is one scene, before he resigns, that he walks through  the office yelling &quot;Mine!&quot;, &quot;Mine!&quot; at all the pictures  of the finished projects that form the economic foundation of the firm for  which he works, beacuse they were HIS projects.)  So not even his masculine  ego was suffering such that he needed an adulterous fling with new young  flesh to feel like a man again.  And a Black architect in Harlem (like a  stock broker on investment banker)? Current statistics report that there  are at least eight eligible Black women for every LOSER of a Black man in  the U.S. today (let alone for every unhappy white woman looking to get  caught up in the theme of the movie for a little while); an architect who  looks like Wesley Snipes could have had virtually any beautiful woman in  his bed from the day he got back from his honeymoon to the first day of the  movie.  Yet he tells Annabella Sciorra one night while they are working-  knowing his desire for her has (somehow) become uncontrollable- &quot;You  know, I've never cheated on my wife.&quot;Almost needless to say, the  acting in this movie, including Nicholas Turturro in an actually Platonic  black/white relationship that probably could have been the focal one for  the film- along with much of the direction, cinematography, and father  Lee's (and Terrance Blanchard's) music score- is out of this world.  They  are all so good, in fact, they have you enjoy the movie to such a degree  that, maybe, one is inclined to ignore the fact that Spike didn't say what  he tried to say very well.  That is why I say this particular Spike Lee  film is paradoxically good and bad simultaneously.  A white reviewer  couldn't have gotten away with saying it was bad on these grounds when the  movie came out, regardless of its good points, I don't think (both Siskel  and Ebert praised it unanimously- almost defensively- without mentioning  any of this). Neither could a Black male one who has ever been seen in a  restaurant with a white woman (like the scene in which the mutli-talented  Queen Latifah as a waitress curses Wesley's character out for taking his  now white mistress to Sylvia's in Harlem); unless of course he was caught  up in some politically ultra-conservative neurosis and expectedly proved  Spike's point via the hypocrises of his life by default. Because of that, I  think they all played it safe and reviewed Spike's courage for talking  about what to this day still can't be talked about rationally in society,  instead of the actual film.Spike Lee treated the attraction to the  opposite sex of the opposite race in America with such anachronistic  disdain that he made it into a complete and totally irredeemable disease  that doesn't just effect people but completely destroys them.  Jungle  fever, as expressed in the movie, in light of how implausibly it began with  the two characters, the outside people it touched and the resultant  wrecking of their mutual lives, looks more like schizophrenia than a social  issue borne out of the country's sex-based racist past.  Because of that,  the movie, ironically, subliminally challenged me- as it will probably  challenge everyone who watches it consciously- to defend the possibility  that, just maybe, two people from different races could actually fall in  love in an inconvenient way and time.  Throughout the entire movie I kept  feeling a litle part of my mind condemn Snipes' character for all his  actions, but simultaneously and irrationally defend the entire concept of  miscegenation; something I never did (because I was never inclined to)  before the movie.  The sub-plot of Sam Jackson's spiral into madness and  death via drug addiction becomes a metaphor for the main plot, and  therefore the voice of Spike's heavy handed- and because of which  ineffective- moral pronouncement. He obviously saw wanting or loving white  women if you're Black (or vice versa) as a drug with no nutritional or  redemptive value, purely addictive and destructive; something that must be  run from like the plague- like the way children are supposed to run from  strangers- at all costs: the exact philosophy practically every drug ADDICT  (and dabbler into promiscuous race-tabu sex) had before they got  &quot;hooked&quot;. In other words, Spike brought up more uncomfortable  questions and psychological issues than maybe even he realized; the kind  that he couldn't answer in the film, but made the necessity to do so so  strong that not doing so created the film's near fatal flaw.Seeing  nothing essentially wrong with being with a woman of the  &quot;opposite&quot; race if there are authentic feelings involved (and it  isn't out of infidelity), and even if it is just physical attraction, is  one of the prinicpal reasons why I have never had the desire.  For me  personally, with nothing constantly reminding me of the tabu, there is  nothing to take my focus away from what I actually love most: my  (coincidentally Black, like all the ones before her) girlfriend.  Spike  seemed to want people to feel and behave otherwise; which feeds on the very  problem the film is underscoring.Again, anyone watching this film will  truly enjoy the ensemble acting, etc.  Everyone is great in it.  If the  film troubles you ever so slightly though, it may not be becuase of what  you have heard about it regarding our society's historical problem with the  issue that is brought up.  It may be becuase of what peole feel they better  not say. Because saying it incorrectly, whether you're Black or white, man  or woman, could still have them quietly judged almost as harshly as the  main characters of the film were openly, in their own respective worlds.  We really don't know what Spike thinks of the subject matter he presented,  as much as we (or he) would like to believe.",3,"Paradoxically good/bad; misses the mark, but beautifully",966211200,"08 14,

63011,APVNDUMOTRJ78,0783230389,E. Drake,"[0, 1]","I am going through all of Spike's films chronologically. This is Spike Lee's fifth film and follows along the lines of ""Do the Right Thing"". So far this is my second favorite (of five) Spike Lee films.It is an excellent film because of the intensity of numerous scenes throughout it. In fact anyone out there who has not yet seen this film must see it for the following scene in particular.  Here is a brief description.The scene I am referring to is the one in which Wesley Snipes scopes out his brother.  It begins with a woman preaching in the name of Jesus over a great soul song (the film was scored by Stevie Wonder) with heavy bass lines. Snipes walks through the city asking for his brother's whereabouts and is finally led to the Taj Mahal, a place swarming with people using and abusing crack. We finally find Samuel L. Jackson, Snipes' brother in the film, with Halle Berry (in her very first performance).Other notable scenes are when Annabella Sciorra's, Snipe's girlfriend in the scene, father finds out she has been dating a black man or when Samuel L. Jackson's character, Gator, goes home one last time demanding money, from his mother, for his addiction.As for the acting, the film is packed with incredible performances. Ossie Davis, John Turturro, Anthony Quinn, Samuel L. Jackson, Ruby Dee, Annabella Sciorra and Wesley Snipes are all superb actors in this film.I agree with other reviewers, mentioning how over-the-top some of the people's reactions are to the interracial relationship central to the story. However, I refuse to say that they are unrealistic. I believe Spike Lee has merely acted out many of the thoughts of the racist person to show how dangerous such thoughts can be.",4,Film #5 Interracial Relationships,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,1708,"['am', 'going', 'Spike', 'films', 'chronologically', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'fifth', 'film', 'along', 'lines', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'So', 'far', 'second', 'favorite', 'five', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'films.It', 'excellent', 'film', 'intensity', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'fact', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'following', 'scene', 'particular', 'Here', 'brief', 'description.The', 'scene', 'am', 'referring', 'one', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'out', 'brother', 'woman', 'preaching', 'name', 'Jesus', 'great', 'soul', 'song', 'film', 'was', 'scored', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'heavy', 'bass', 'lines', 'Snipes', 'city', 'asking', 'brother', 'whereabouts', 'finally', 'led', 'Taj', 'Mahal', 'place', 'swarming', 'people', 'using', 'abusing', 'crack', 'finally', 'find', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Snipes', 'brother', 'film', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'very', 'first', 'performance', '.Other', 'notable', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'Snipe', 'girlfriend', 'scene', 'father', 'out', 'been', 'dating', 'black', 'man', 'when', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'character', 'Gator', 'home', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'demanding', 'money', 'mother', 'addiction.As', 'acting', 'film', 'packed', 'incredible', 'performances', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'are', 'superb', 'actors', 'film.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioning', 'how', 'over-the-top', 'people', 'reactions', 'are', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'central', 'story', 'However', 'refuse', 'say', 'are', 'unrealistic', 'believe', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'merely', 'acted', 'out', 'many', 'thoughts', 'racist', 'person', 'show', 'how', 'dangerous', 'such', 'thoughts', 'can', 'be']",N/A

If that's true, you won't be able to tell during Jungle Fever - at least not in a way you'd expect.  Jungle Fever is a lot of things - daring, empassioned, extreme, overarching, undeniably and intentionally ""heavy"" - but amateurish it is not.  Watching Jungle Fever now made me realize all the power Lee movies entail - which is, especially at this point in his career, a real voice.  Two scenes of extremes are rendered in equal precision - a group of African American women discussing the problems of keeping their men, contrasting with an equally long and empassioned scene of pugnacious racism between a group of Bensonhurst Italians.  In each scene the experience of its characters is given vividness by the authenticity of the dialogue, by the conviction of its cast.  And of the cast, let me add what a treasure of an ensemble it is: 15 years later, virtually every supporting role (some on screen for just minutes) has become a recognizable performer (it's a game in itself to count how many Oscar, Emmy, Tony, and Grammy wins/ nominations, not to mention plush Sopranos roles, these actors share).  In its leading roles, Wesley Snipes has a seething immediacy, John Turturro burns with conscience, and Samuel L. Jackson, in the most fearless performances of his career, unfolds so many gripping layers at once, the Cannes jury created a special acting prize to honor him.  All that helps make Jungle Fever provocative in the right ways - sparking conversations, as well as personal speculations, about the modern state of racism, of the way that we're never free of our own cultural expectations, and how they effect who and how we love.  The movie's first giant, nagging flaw is its attempt to handle too much - the plot that follows the path of crack addiction belongs to a (terrific) different movie.  Its second, and this is tougher, is that the notion of this ""fever,"" of Flipper (Snipes) and Angie (Annabella Sciorra) being blinded by each others' race, is an unfulfilled idea in the movie - the characters, I'm afraid, work better as catalysts for thier environments than they do as lovers, as their affair is remote, and Sciorra, a gifted actress elsewhere, seems far too cold for fevers of any kind.  Yet even these flaws are the product of a force already at work on the film industry - the movie suffers only from an ambition to reach all aspects of the urban race experience, and succeeds as well as can be expected; you'll rarely recall a film who fails its goals this intriguingly.",4,"""When's the future?""",1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,2625,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'said', 'hindsight', ""'d"", 'lost', 'abilities', 'filmmaker', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'true', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'least', 'not', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'lot', 'things', 'daring', 'empassioned', 'extreme', 'overarching', 'undeniably', 'intentionally', 'heavy', 'amateurish', 'not', 'Watching', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'now', 'made', 'realize', 'power', 'Lee', 'movies', 'entail', 'especially', 'point', 'career', 'real', 'voice', 'Two', 'scenes', 'extremes', 'are', 'rendered', 'equal', 'precision', 'group', 'African', 'American', 'women', 'discussing', 'problems', 'keeping', 'men', 'contrasting', 'equally', 'long', 'empassioned', 'scene', 'pugnacious', 'racism', 'group', 'Bensonhurst', 'Italians', 'scene', 'experience', 'characters', 'given', 'vividness', 'authenticity', 'dialogue', 'conviction', 'cast', 'cast', 'let', 'add', 'what', 'treasure', 'ensemble', '15', 'years', 'later', 'virtually', 'supporting', 'role', 'screen', 'just', 'minutes', 'become', 'recognizable', 'performer', 'game', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'Oscar', 'Emmy', 'Tony', 'Grammy', 'wins/', 'nominations', 'not', 'mention', 'plush', 'Sopranos', 'roles', 'actors', 'share', 'leading', 'roles', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'seething', 'immediacy', 'John', 'Turturro', 'conscience', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'most', 'fearless', 'performances', 'career', 'unfolds', 'so', 'many', 'gripping', 'layers', 'once', 'Cannes', 'jury', 'created', 'special', 'acting', 'prize', 'honor', 'make', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'provocative', 'right', 'ways', 'sparking', 'conversations', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'speculations', 'modern', 'state', 'racism', 'way', ""'re"", 'never', 'free', 'own', 'cultural', 'expectations', 'how', 'effect', 'who', 'how', 'love', 'movie', 'first', 'giant', 'nagging', 'flaw', 'attempt', 'handle', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'path', 'crack', 'addiction', 'terrific', 'different', 'movie', 'second', 'tougher', 'notion', 'fever', 'Flipper', 'Snipes', 'Angie', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'being', 'blinded', 'others', 'race', 'unfulfilled', 'idea', 'movie', 'characters', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'work', 'better', 'catalysts', 'thier', 'environments', 'do', 'lovers', 'affair', 'remote', 'Sciorra', 'gifted', 'actress', 'elsewhere', 'far', 'too', 'cold', 'fevers', 'kind', 'even', 'flaws', 'are', 'product', 'force', 'already', 'work', 'film', 'industry', 'movie', 'only', 'ambition', 'reach', 'aspects', 'urban', 'race', 'experience', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'expected', ""'ll"", 'rarely', 'recall', 'film', 'who', 'goals', 'intriguingly']",N/A

63015,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,0783230389,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[0, 1]","Ever since ""Romeo and Juliet"" people have been fascinated by love that crosses cultural barriers. Romeo and Juliet a la Spike Lee is the story of Flipper, a middle-class black architect from Harlem and Angie, a working-class Italian-American from Brooklyn. In Jungle Fever, Lee returns to the theme of racial tensions that marked his breakthrough film, ""Do the Right Thing."" The result is big, bold, vibrant and more than a little sprawling. By the end of it you feel run over by a truck. Everyone in the film has been somehow touched by Flip and Angie's affair. Drew throws Flip out of the house (and some people may wonder why Lee finds the affair's interracial nature more of a sin than its being a marital infidelity). Fathers on both sides disown their children. And a lot of people become self-conscious about their own ethnicity - dark-skinned Italians just as much as light-skinned blacks.Lee's forte is scenes of confrontation, and Jungle Fever is a series of them, scorchingly written, extremely well acted and utterly riveting. (Sensitive souls should note that, along with ""Goodfellas,"" this film held the Hollywood record for profanity, though it's long since been surpassed.) What he isn't able to do - at this stage of his career at least - is to organize them into a shapely narrative. The film doesn't really build, but stays pretty much on one pitch throughout. And, towards the end, Lee loses the love story in favor of a subplot featuring Flip's crack-addict older brother Gator (Samuel L. Jackson). The scene where Flip has to go to a crack den called the Taj Mahal to find Gator, scored to Stevie Wonder's ""Livin' for the City"", is terrific, and one of the best-sustained sequences Lee has ever filmed. But it's in the wrong film. Gator's story has no relevance to the central story of interracial love, apart from his addiction being a parallel sin of the flesh to Flip's adultery in the eyes of their father, played with painful dignity and restraint by Ossie Davis. Samuel L. Jackson broke out from a series of minor roles as hoodlums with this performance, which won him a specially-created Supporting Actor Award at Cannes. But by this time in the film, Flip and Angie's story has almost been forgotten. That's Halle Berry, by the way, as Gator's equally addicted girlfriend.You could say that Lee is less interested in the love story than in examining its effects. He's also far less interested in Angie (though Sciorra does her best with the part) than he is in Flip: the film ends with him with her all but written out. Lee had faced accusations of sexism from his first feature (She's Gotta Have It) onwards. He certainly tries to answer them here: there's a long sequence where Drew and her friends pour out their grievances about the men in their lives. It's a brave attempt, though it fails Joanna Russ's test for fully-dimensional female characters: do two women have a conversation at any time in the story that isn't about men? Not here they don't: the conversation is entirely about men, their ways, and their......parts.Other pluses are Ernest Dickerson's camerawork, the visual stylization toned down somewhat since Do the Right Thing - though Lee has developed a signature shot, where characters seem to glide rather than walk. The film also benefits from several newly-written songs from Stevie Wonder, though the best-used example is a pre-existing one, ""Livin' in the City"" cited above.",4,"Open up your eyes, and you will be surprised to see what the world is truly like.",1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,3430,"['Ever', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'fascinated', 'love', 'cultural', 'barriers', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'la', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'story', 'Flipper', 'middle-class', 'black', 'architect', 'Harlem', 'Angie', 'working-class', 'Italian-American', 'Brooklyn', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'Lee', 'theme', 'racial', 'tensions', 'marked', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'result', 'big', 'bold', 'vibrant', 'more', 'little', 'sprawling', 'end', 'feel', 'run', 'over', 'truck', 'Everyone', 'film', 'been', 'somehow', 'touched', 'Flip', 'Angie', 'affair', 'Drew', 'Flip', 'house', 'people', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'Lee', 'affair', 'interracial', 'nature', 'more', 'sin', 'being', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'Fathers', 'sides', 'disown', 'children', 'lot', 'people', 'become', 'self-conscious', 'own', 'ethnicity', 'dark-skinned', 'Italians', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'light-skinned', 'blacks.Lee', 'forte', 'scenes', 'confrontation', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'series', 'scorchingly', 'written', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'utterly', 'riveting', 'Sensitive', 'souls', 'should', 'note', 'Goodfellas', 'film', 'held', 'Hollywood', 'record', 'profanity', 'long', 'been', 'surpassed', 'What', ""n't"", 'able', 'do', 'stage', 'career', 'least', 'organize', 'shapely', 'narrative', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'build', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'pitch', 'end', 'Lee', 'love', 'story', 'favor', 'subplot', 'featuring', 'Flip', 'crack-addict', 'older', 'brother', 'Gator', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'scene', 'where', 'Flip', 'go', 'crack', 'den', 'called', 'Taj', 'Mahal', 'find', 'Gator', 'scored', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Livin', 'City', 'terrific', 'one', 'best-sustained', 'sequences', 'Lee', 'ever', 'filmed', 'wrong', 'film', 'Gator', 'story', 'relevance', 'central', 'story', 'interracial', 'love', 'apart', 'addiction', 'being', 'parallel', 'sin', 'flesh', 'Flip', 'adultery', 'eyes', 'father', 'played', 'painful', 'dignity', 'restraint', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'broke', 'out', 'series', 'minor', 'roles', 'hoodlums', 'performance', 'won', 'specially-created', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Award', 'Cannes', 'time', 'film', 'Flip', 'Angie', 'story', 'almost', 'been', 'forgotten', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'way', 'Gator', 'equally', 'addicted', 'girlfriend.You', 'could', 'say', 'Lee', 'less', 'interested', 'love', 'story', 'examining', 'effects', 'also', 'far', 'less', 'interested', 'Angie', 'Sciorra', 'best', 'part', 'Flip', 'film', 'written', 'out', 'Lee', 'had', 'faced', 'accusations', 'sexism', 'first', 'feature', 'Got', 'ta', 'Have', 'onwards', 'certainly', 'answer', 'here', 'long', 'sequence', 'where', 'Drew', 'friends', 'pour', 'out', 'grievances', 'men', 'lives', 'brave', 'attempt', 'Joanna', 'Russ', 'test', 'fully-dimensional', 'female', 'characters', 'do', 'two', 'women', 'have', 'conversation', 'time', 'story', ""n't"", 'men', 'Not', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'conversation', 'entirely', 'men', 'ways', 'parts.Other', 'pluses', 'are', 'Ernest', 'Dickerson', 'camerawork', 'visual', 'stylization', 'toned', 'down', 'somewhat', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Lee', 'developed', 'signature', 'shot', 'where', 'characters', 'seem', 'glide', 'rather', 'walk', 'film', 'also', 'benefits', 'several', 'newly-written', 'songs', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'best-used', 'example', 'pre-existing', 'one', 'Livin', 'City', 'cited']",N/A
63016,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,0783230389,J. O. Booker,"[0, 1]","Just checked out this flick. First time I've seen it in years. The first time I saw it in the theater overwhelmed me, not the subject matter, which everyone in America should be aware of, but with the flamboyant way that Lee cautioned against interracial relationships. I'm talking about the cinematography, the lighting, the various gels used to make the picture look dirty in the crack-house scenes, the Stevie Wonder soundtrack, though good in its own right, probably one of his best albums. Lee's film had a great deal of style. Now that I'm much older and have a lot more films under my belt, it's that sledge-hammer style of this film, of Lee's take on interracial dating, that makes this film feel dated to me.But to someone who's yet to see this film, Lee's film remains as potent--though at times contrived--as it was when it came out 20 years ago. In a nutshell, Jungle Fever focuses on a struggling Black architect who is forced to take on a beautiful Italian White woman as his partner. They work very late hours alone and inevitably they have an affair. This becomes the axis of several subplots indirectly related to their relationship including one involving his estranged crackhead brother, Gator, played convincingly by a much younger Samuel Jackson. There's also a subplot involving a coffee shop-owner who has a crush on a Black female customer. The dominant theme of the film, which is at times disjointed, is the difficulty of maintaining such a relationship under external pressures, but this theme was explored more effectively in other films, the earliest of which, in my recollection, is Douglas Sirk's wonderful All That Heaven Allows starring Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. The cultural taboo in that film was the age difference of the lovers. Another film, which Lee probably referenced for Fever is German director Rainier Werner Fassbinder's sad but sweet film Ali: Fear Eats the Soul in which the cultural taboo of interracial relationship compounds the fact that the Black man was Muslim and his much much older White lover's parents belonged to the Nazi party.Compared to these earlier films, Lee's is obviously more ""Hollywood"" as far as drama is concerned but still it's a worthy addition to films that were brave enough to deal with this subject at all.",4,Flawed though well-intentioned,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,2286,"['Just', 'checked', 'out', 'flick', 'First', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'theater', 'overwhelmed', 'not', 'subject', 'matter', 'everyone', 'America', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'flamboyant', 'way', 'Lee', 'cautioned', 'interracial', 'relationships', ""'m"", 'talking', 'cinematography', 'lighting', 'various', 'gels', 'used', 'make', 'picture', 'look', 'dirty', 'crack-house', 'scenes', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'soundtrack', 'though', 'good', 'own', 'right', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'albums', 'Lee', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'style', 'Now', ""'m"", 'much', 'older', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'films', 'belt', 'sledge-hammer', 'style', 'film', 'Lee', 'take', 'interracial', 'dating', 'film', 'feel', 'dated', 'me.But', 'someone', 'who', 'yet', 'see', 'film', 'Lee', 'film', 'potent', 'times', 'contrived', 'was', 'when', 'came', 'out', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'nutshell', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'struggling', 'Black', 'architect', 'who', 'forced', 'take', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'White', 'woman', 'partner', 'work', 'very', 'late', 'hours', 'alone', 'inevitably', 'have', 'affair', 'axis', 'several', 'subplots', 'indirectly', 'related', 'relationship', 'including', 'one', 'involving', 'estranged', 'crackhead', 'brother', 'Gator', 'played', 'convincingly', 'much', 'younger', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'also', 'subplot', 'involving', 'coffee', 'shop-owner', 'who', 'crush', 'Black', 'female', 'customer', 'dominant', 'theme', 'film', 'times', 'disjointed', 'difficulty', 'maintaining', 'such', 'relationship', 'external', 'pressures', 'theme', 'was', 'explored', 'more', 'effectively', 'other', 'films', 'earliest', 'recollection', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'wonderful', 'Heaven', 'Allows', 'starring', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'cultural', 'taboo', 'film', 'was', 'age', 'difference', 'lovers', 'film', 'Lee', 'probably', 'referenced', 'Fever', 'German', 'director', 'Rainier', 'Werner', 'Fassbinder', 'sad', 'sweet', 'film', 'Ali', 'Fear', 'Soul', 'cultural', 'taboo', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'fact', 'Black', 'man', 'was', 'Muslim', 'much', 'much', 'older', 'White', 'lover', 'parents', 'belonged', 'Nazi', 'party.Compared', 'earlier', 'films', 'Lee', 'obviously', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'as', 'far', 'drama', 'concerned', 'still', 'worthy', 'addition', 'films', 'were', 'brave', 'enough', 'deal', 'subject']",N/A

There were too many things going on and in the end, it all seemed useless. I guess Spike wanted to get people talking about race and if that was his goal, then he achieved it.

Kelsey ""lkelsey""","[21, 26]","One of Spike Lee's best films, &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; comments more on race relations in America, than on the subject of adultery.  Spike is all  over the place with his take on male/female relationships, the devastation  wrought on a family and the Black community by crack cocaine, the  &quot;color line&quot; in the Italian community and interracial  relationships.  But he seems to pull it all together to make a powerful  film and one of the best of the '90s.The acting is terrific with the  standout performance being Samuel L. Jackson's as Gator, Wesley Snipes ill  fated brother.  He's charming, comical and evil all at once.  And Wesley  showed his range as an actor through his performance as Flipper, the  &quot;good son,&quot; who has a momentary lapse in character and has an  affair with his secretary, Annabella Sciorra.  All the performances are  great and the actors get you to care about the characters they present.  Wesley's performance came after the strong work he did as Nino Brown in  &quot;New Jack City&quot; and I don't remember an actor &quot;flippin' the  script&quot; on the movie going public like that, going from evil to good,  in one year in a long time.You could look at Flipper and Angie as  symbols of Black and White America, trying to come together and the  obstacles we face as a nation when we don't deal with the issue of race  honestly.  Something we're still going through.  This film also deals with  our dishonesty with dealing with the drug problem too, and this is where  Spike deserves credit.  No one is left unexamined by this tale of life and  there are no happy endings either from Gator being murdered by his father,  to Flipper and Angie breaking up.I love how Spike begins and ends the  movie.  Spike shows in the beginning a couple, obviously in love, in Wesley  and Lonnette Mc Kee, (in a strong, small supporting role as Drew) that  leads you to believe nothing could tear them apart.  When you get to the  end, Wesley and Lonnette are trying to make a go at it, but through  Lonnette's tears, you see she's just going through the motions, hoping to  put away the pain through the lovemaking.  When she tells him &quot;he  better leave now,&quot; you can tell the hurt she's experienced can't be  &quot;loved away&quot; like he'd like.Critics of this film usually state  Spike should have stuck to telling one story.  What must be said is that  while Spike explores a range of contemporary issues in this film, he has  made a film of power and emotion, that definitely draws an opinion out of  you, one way or another.

In the video store, in the ""cult classics"" section I found a Spike Lee movie (It was Jungle Fever).  I asked incredulously why Spike Lee was in the cult section.  The owner said that hardly anyone ever rents Spike Lee movies down there.I happen to like Spike Lee movies.  All of them.  I know a number of people emphatically don't and I don't know why.  What I appreciate about Spike Lee movies is that he does not rely on sex, violence, science fiction or special effects as his primary means of entertaining people, although you may sex and violence in his movies.  Spike Lee makes movies the old-fashioned way, he tells a story.  And he has something to say.He makes what I think are very good observations about race relations and the faults of both the black and white communities.  I suspect that many of the people who don't like Spike's movies are people who are uncomfortable with the message.Jungle Fever is about a married middle class black architect in Manhattan who has an affair with a young Italian American girl from BayRidge, Brooklyn.The movie is loaded with acting talent:  Wesley Snipes, the late Anthony Quinn, Ossie Davis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Turturro (One of my favorite actors-57 movies-Barton Fink), Halle Berry (the flattest, thinnest tummy in Hollywood now, but not in this movie.  Do I suspect liposuction?), Nicholas Turturro (John's brother-the Hispanic Detective in NYPD Blue.  I don't like him.  He went Hollywood.  The Turturro's are from Brooklyn.  John has an apartment there and still rides the subway.), Michael Imperioli (Christopher on The Sopranos, Queen Latifah (she play a waitress with an attitude, in a scene in the restaurant Silvia's in Harlem.  I've always liked Queen Latifah.), Danny Aielo, and Ruby Dee.  Doubtless you will recognize other actors that don't mean anything to me.I sort of have the same problem with my video store here as they have in Nag's Head.  I can't even get She' Gotta Have it and School Daze, which are his first two movies.I find all of Spike's movies 100% credible.  Spike Lee is doing heavy social criticism and making entertaining movies.  I wonder why no one else is?  Who says movies these days are trash?  The timing of the movie was perfect.  Dinkins beat Giuliani for mayor.  A black police commissioner.  Race murders in Bensonhust, Howard Beach..  Police brutality on blacks.  Korean grocers in bad neighborhoods working 20 hours a day and being boycotted by black.  2,000 murder a year.

Boram ""baltimorescience""","[6, 11]","spike lee is an interesting director, says a lot of good things, and speaks his mind in the press.hwever, this movie seems really dull and watered down.the central relationship between snipes and the white woman has no sparks at all. a totally unbelievable pairing. i couldn't understand why snipes would cheat on his wife.  it's not clear what his motives are.  her motives...something, anything better or more exciting than her banal existence....are much clearer.  is snipes bored in his marriage, or is he just very belated in trying to fulfill the age old ""fantasy"" of black males to get with a white woman?  i couldn't tell you, because it's not at all clear to me. the moral of the movie- ""idealism is ok, but it can never really work out"" is off base, because it can't work out anyway, black or white....when a married guy sneaks around on his wife...whom he is apparently still in love with.all the issues portrayed in the movie are real and need to be discussed in film, but i was bummed out by the some of ways which they were brought forth.  a big one for me is his targeting of racist italians.  in this movie it's the poor working class italians that are the problem?  racism is very common in ALL low income areas. the group that spike targets here...brooklyn ""bodda-bing-bodda boom"" italians...seems silly. sure some of those guys are racist, but they are not causing the majority of problems in the US of A...rather the herded-off-in-the-suburbs middle class white people, this subtle yet ultra powerful form of racism...i see this as the real problem, not the (relatvely speaking) small old school (and quickly dying out) ethnic populations of the buroughs.  why didn't spike choose middle class racism as his subject matter?  was it too nuanced to portray on film?  how about this:  a suburban white intern who falls in with her well to do black boss...her supposedly ""liberal"" white family totally disapproves. the economics of the pairing would ordinarily be cause for approval, but the ultimate issue is the color of skin. NOW THAT is way more on the mark.  who cares about lower class ""bodda-bing-bodda-boom"" italian racists?  (i'm italian btw) they have no political power in america, they don't sway votes and they don't give scholarships and jobs to white people that should go to black people.  did spike get beat up by some some ""wiseguys"" as a teen or something?it just seems like a real misfire by spike, and not genuine.  another movie about racism ""higher learning"", showed racism on a college campus by nazi skinheads from idaho!  come on!  there are many way more acute examples of racism on a college campus.  who takes a skinhead seriously?  however, a rich white dean of a school may well have some racist ideas in his mind. THAT wasn't shown in the movie.  again, it seems like these directors are dumbing down the issue for the audience or something.  i don't know why they would squander the chance to actually SHOW how racism pervades our society...but instead show a sensationalist easy to pick on minority group who has old school racist ideas.incidentally, i thought ""bamboozled"" was great.  really cuts the chase about the racism in the entertainment industry and shows how the audiences love stuff that panders to their most ignorant notions.  ""bamboozled"" is way more ambitious and hard hitting.  more enjoyable all around too.so why does spike insult our intelligence with ""jungle fever?""james baldwin's book ""another country"" deals with this subject with a lot a depth and examines many angles.  check that out instead of this one.",2,racism dumbed down for the masses,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,3580,"['spike', 'lee', 'interesting', 'director', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'mind', 'press.hwever', 'movie', 'really', 'dull', 'watered', 'down.the', 'central', 'relationship', 'snipes', 'white', 'woman', 'sparks', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'pairing', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'snipes', 'would', 'cheat', 'wife', 'not', 'clear', 'what', 'motives', 'are', 'motives', 'something', 'anything', 'better', 'more', 'exciting', 'banal', 'existence', '.are', 'much', 'clearer', 'snipes', 'bored', 'marriage', 'just', 'very', 'belated', 'trying', 'fulfill', 'age', 'old', 'fantasy', 'black', 'males', 'get', 'white', 'woman', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'not', 'clear', 'moral', 'movie-', 'idealism', 'ok', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'work', 'out', 'base', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'anyway', 'black', 'white', '.when', 'married', 'guy', 'sneaks', 'wife', 'whom', 'apparently', 'still', 'love', 'issues', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'are', 'real', 'need', 'be', 'discussed', 'film', 'i', 'was', 'bummed', 'out', 'ways', 'were', 'brought', 'forth', 'big', 'one', 'targeting', 'racist', 'italians', 'movie', 'poor', 'working', 'class', 'italians', 'are', 'problem', 'racism', 'very', 'common', 'ALL', 'low', 'income', 'areas', 'group', 'targets', 'here', 'bodda-bing-bodda', 'boom', 'italians', 'silly', 'sure', 'guys', 'are', 'racist', 'are', 'not', 'causing', 'majority', 'problems', 'US', 'A', 'rather', 'herded-off-in-the-suburbs', 'middle', 'class', 'white', 'people', 'subtle', 'yet', 'ultra', 'powerful', 'form', 'racism', 'i', 'see', 'real', 'problem', 'not', 'relatvely', 'speaking', 'small', 'old', 'school', 'quickly', 'dying', 'out', 'ethnic', 'populations', 'buroughs', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'spike', 'choose', 'middle', 'class', 'racism', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'too', 'nuanced', 'portray', 'film', 'how', 'suburban', 'white', 'intern', 'who', 'well', 'do', 'black', 'boss', 'supposedly', 'liberal', 'white', 'family', 'totally', 'economics', 'pairing', 'would', 'ordinarily', 'be', 'cause', 'approval', 'ultimate', 'issue', 'color', 'skin', 'way', 'more', 'mark', 'who', 'lower', 'class', 'bodda-bing-bodda-boom', 'italian', 'racists', 'i', ""'m"", 'italian', 'btw', 'have', 'political', 'power', 'america', 'do', ""n't"", 'sway', 'votes', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'scholarships', 'jobs', 'white', 'people', 'should', 'go', 'black', 'people', 'did', 'spike', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'wiseguys', 'teen', 'something', 'just', 'real', 'misfire', 'spike', 'not', 'genuine', 'movie', 'racism', 'higher', 'learning', 'showed', 'racism', 'college', 'campus', 'nazi', 'skinheads', 'idaho', 'come', 'are', 'many', 'way', 'more', 'acute', 'examples', 'racism', 'college', 'campus', 'who', 'skinhead', 'seriously', 'however', 'rich', 'white', 'dean', 'school', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'racist', 'ideas', 'mind', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'movie', 'again', 'directors', 'are', 'dumbing', 'down', 'issue', 'audience', 'something', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'would', 'squander', 'chance', 'actually', 'SHOW', 'how', 'racism', 'society', 'instead', 'show', 'sensationalist', 'easy', 'pick', 'minority', 'group', 'who', 'old', 'school', 'racist', 'ideas.incidentally', 'i', 'thought', 'bamboozled', 'was', 'great', 'really', 'chase', 'racism', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'how', 'audiences', 'love', 'stuff', 'panders', 'most', 'ignorant', 'notions', 'bamboozled', 'way', 'more', 'ambitious', 'hard', 'hitting', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'too.so', 'why', 'spike', 'insult', 'intelligence', 'jungle', 'fever', 'baldwin', 'book', 'country', 'deals', 'subject', 'lot', 'depth', 'examines', 'many', 'angles', 'check', 'out', 'instead', 'one']",N/A

63037,A3KLC5M7K1C5FJ,0783230389,Vato-Curandero,"[8, 9]","To date, Hollywood has produced very few movies dealing with interracial dating or marriage. In Jungle Fever, director Spike Lee (who also co-stars in the film) tackles this complex issue and the controversies surrounding it. The main action revolves around a middle-class Black architect, Flipper Purify (played by Wesley Snipes), and his extra-marital affair with his white, Italian-American secretary, Angela (Anabella Sciorra). Flipper and Angela have a burning sexual attraction for one another, fueled by racist sexual stereotypes each has for the opposite race. These passions culminate in a one-night stand that eventually drags out for several weeks. In the meantime, both people are forced to deal with the social implications of their actions - Flipper for cheating on his wife and, equally, for sleeping with a white woman; while Angela becomes an outcast in her Italian-American neighborhood for sleeping with a black man.Some people have attacked Spike Lee's Jungle Fever by claiming that Lee is condemning interracial relationships. This is nonsense. Lee is neither promoting nor condemning interracial dating...he is merely analyzing the strong stigma Americans (Black and White alike) attach to dating outside of one's respective race. In the film Lee gives equal time to the anger and hostility that many whites and blacks have against dating across racial lines.Anyone who has ever been involved in an interracial relationship will be able to relate to this movie. The movie struck a personal note with me, as I have exerienced the stares, glares, heads shaking in disgust, and snide comments that whites, blacks, and Latinos alike have given me regarding interracial dating. This movie is brutally honest; it does not sugarcoat a sensitive topic.As is typical of a Spike Lee joint, Jungle Fever is a mix of serious drama and comedy. The acting is superb, and Spike Lee uses many of his regulars such as John Turturro, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Samuel L. Jackson, Rick Aiello, and Miguel Sandoval in the cast. Also of note...this was Halle Berry's first major role in a motion picture. Turturro delivers the best performance in the film as the owner of a newspaper cafe who has a romantic interest in a Black customer.Fortunately, the DVD comes with some nice extras. Included are the original theatrical trailer and a short documentary on the filming of Jungle Fever where the cast discuss their experiences on the set and their thoughts about the film.On a side note...Spike Lee decided to film Jungle Fever shortly after the real-life murder of Yusuf Hawkins, a black youth, who was killed in an Italian-American section of New York City after it was discovered that he was dating a white female. Spike's critics acuse him of race-baiting and playing the race card...I say Spike depicts the reality of the world in which we live.",5,Brutally honest look at interracial relationships,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2848,"['date', 'Hollywood', 'produced', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'dealing', 'interracial', 'dating', 'marriage', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'who', 'also', 'co-stars', 'film', 'complex', 'issue', 'controversies', 'surrounding', 'main', 'action', 'around', 'middle-class', 'Black', 'architect', 'Flipper', 'Purify', 'played', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'extra-marital', 'affair', 'white', 'Italian-American', 'secretary', 'Angela', 'Anabella', 'Sciorra', 'Flipper', 'Angela', 'have', 'burning', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'one', 'fueled', 'racist', 'sexual', 'stereotypes', 'opposite', 'race', 'passions', 'culminate', 'one-night', 'stand', 'eventually', 'out', 'several', 'weeks', 'meantime', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'deal', 'social', 'implications', 'actions', 'Flipper', 'cheating', 'wife', 'equally', 'sleeping', 'white', 'woman', 'Angela', 'outcast', 'Italian-American', 'neighborhood', 'sleeping', 'black', 'man.Some', 'people', 'have', 'attacked', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'claiming', 'Lee', 'condemning', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'nonsense', 'Lee', 'promoting', 'condemning', 'interracial', 'dating', 'merely', 'analyzing', 'strong', 'stigma', 'Americans', 'Black', 'White', 'alike', 'attach', 'dating', 'one', 'respective', 'race', 'film', 'Lee', 'equal', 'time', 'anger', 'hostility', 'many', 'whites', 'blacks', 'have', 'dating', 'racial', 'lines.Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'involved', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'movie', 'movie', 'struck', 'personal', 'note', 'have', 'exerienced', 'stares', 'glares', 'heads', 'shaking', 'disgust', 'snide', 'comments', 'whites', 'blacks', 'Latinos', 'alike', 'have', 'given', 'regarding', 'interracial', 'dating', 'movie', 'brutally', 'honest', 'not', 'sugarcoat', 'sensitive', 'topic.As', 'typical', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'joint', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'mix', 'serious', 'drama', 'comedy', 'acting', 'superb', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'many', 'regulars', 'such', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Rick', 'Aiello', 'Miguel', 'Sandoval', 'cast', 'Also', 'note', 'was', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'motion', 'picture', 'Turturro', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'owner', 'newspaper', 'cafe', 'who', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Black', 'customer.Fortunately', 'DVD', 'nice', 'extras', 'Included', 'are', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'short', 'documentary', 'filming', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'where', 'cast', 'discuss', 'experiences', 'set', 'thoughts', 'film.On', 'side', 'note', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'decided', 'film', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'shortly', 'real-life', 'murder', 'Yusuf', 'Hawkins', 'black', 'youth', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Italian-American', 'section', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', 'discovered', 'was', 'dating', 'white', 'female', 'Spike', 'critics', 'acuse', 'race-baiting', 'playing', 'race', 'card', 'say', 'Spike', 'reality', 'world', 'live']",N/A

63039,A4YXKE5F62II8,0783230389,Visual Bureau,"[0, 0]","""If you thought Othello and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? were the social critiques about interracial relationships of our time, wait until you watch Jungle Fever which can be construed as the modern version of these stories but within an urban New York City setting, a Stevie Wonder soundtrack, and a very unsettling tone and strong violent mood about it. Whatever Spike Lee's message is within the film, Jungle Fever is surely one to poke a few buttons about what is wrong more than what is rather right.Inter-ethnic dating and marriages were something of controversy in the U.S. but much of the conflict and preconceptions still arise these days and during the 1990s and Lee has handled much of the film's sometimes fuddled yet charged narrative and dialogue to reflect realistic and potentially exaggerated concerns at the time (black v. white living standards and culture, infidelity, adultery, crack pipes, police intervention, prostitution). Not a traditional love story to say the least, Wesley Snipes plays Flip who worked at a firm but suddenly becomes entangled by temptation by his power struggle and a chance romantic interest in a temporary worker named Angie, played by Annabella Sciorra.The film's disturbing nature takes further force once both ethnic groups start clashing at Flip and Angie for their secret affair. In much of the film's negative and tragic light, there is a sense of vibrancy with the cinematography scheme (similar yellow toning like in Do the Right Thing), choice of music (songs from Stevie Wonder), and the very strong and believable performances from Ossie Davis, Samuel L. Jackson, and John Turturro. The ending scene which involves a prophecy speaks volumes about how Flip's character reaches a point of moral conscience and demise if he is not careful as a father.A film has not made me more gripped and frustrated by its subject matter than the Paddy Considine film, Tyrannosaur (which deals with issues of rage, loneliness, depression, negligence, and domestic abuse) which I recommend as a counter in terms of strongly done dramatic cinema.""",4,"A tragic, frustrating, and fiercely political critique on issues more than just inter-ethnic dating.",1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,2088,"['thought', 'Othello', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'were', 'social', 'critiques', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'time', 'wait', 'watch', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'can', 'be', 'construed', 'modern', 'version', 'stories', 'urban', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'setting', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'unsettling', 'tone', 'strong', 'violent', 'mood', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'message', 'film', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'surely', 'one', 'poke', 'few', 'buttons', 'what', 'wrong', 'more', 'what', 'rather', 'right.Inter-ethnic', 'dating', 'marriages', 'were', 'something', 'controversy', 'U.S.', 'much', 'conflict', 'preconceptions', 'still', 'arise', 'days', '1990s', 'Lee', 'handled', 'much', 'film', 'sometimes', 'fuddled', 'yet', 'charged', 'narrative', 'dialogue', 'reflect', 'realistic', 'potentially', 'exaggerated', 'concerns', 'time', 'black', 'v.', 'white', 'living', 'standards', 'culture', 'infidelity', 'adultery', 'crack', 'pipes', 'police', 'intervention', 'prostitution', 'Not', 'traditional', 'love', 'story', 'say', 'least', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Flip', 'who', 'worked', 'firm', 'suddenly', 'entangled', 'temptation', 'power', 'struggle', 'chance', 'romantic', 'interest', 'temporary', 'worker', 'named', 'Angie', 'played', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra.The', 'film', 'disturbing', 'nature', 'further', 'force', 'once', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'start', 'clashing', 'Flip', 'Angie', 'secret', 'affair', 'much', 'film', 'negative', 'tragic', 'light', 'sense', 'vibrancy', 'cinematography', 'scheme', 'similar', 'yellow', 'toning', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'choice', 'music', 'songs', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'very', 'strong', 'believable', 'performances', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'John', 'Turturro', 'ending', 'scene', 'prophecy', 'volumes', 'how', 'Flip', 'character', 'point', 'moral', 'conscience', 'demise', 'not', 'careful', 'father.A', 'film', 'not', 'made', 'more', 'gripped', 'frustrated', 'subject', 'matter', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'film', 'Tyrannosaur', 'issues', 'rage', 'loneliness', 'depression', 'negligence', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'recommend', 'counter', 'terms', 'strongly', 'done', 'dramatic', 'cinema']",N/A
