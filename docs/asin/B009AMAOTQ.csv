1593692,AGEIT17HENDIS,B009AMAOTQ,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Some cinematic efforts are aimed at a general audience, some toward teens and some, well some to the AARP generation, the now AARP generation since the stars in this film under review, Last Vegas, won their acting spurs when we were young and thought they were cool with their new way of interpreting acting. Well they still are cool, Michael, Robert, Morgan, Mary, and Kevin, even if they have lost a step or seven along the way. This is such an age-centered niche film that I defy anybody to tell me that anybody under say forty would appreciate the story-line.Here is why. Michael Douglas a 70-something life-long bachelor and ladies&#8217; man decides in the face of mortality to get married to a woman significantly younger than himself. Naturally for the geriatric set this wedding was to take place in Las Vegas, the land of ageless dreams. In order to do things up right for Michael it is decided that he and his old time corner boys from Brooklyn (that&#8217;s in NYC for the clueless) should meet up for one last go-round in Vegas.After rounding up the old crew in Vegas all the natural pratfalls of the old and set in their ways dodge the foursome (except for a duel run at Mary by Michael and Robert). The major question though is the propriety of Michael marrying that young thing which is of course resolved against the notion of intergenerational alliances. The stop of the wedding is aided by that age-appropriate Mary and her beguiling of Michael as well as sage advice from Robert. Along the way all the issues of aging-sickness, assisted living, over-protective children, sexual impotence, sexual desire, and mortality are dealt with either comically or more seriously- issues that those who relate to the wisdom of  50 Cent would be either clueless or indifferent about but that the generation of &#8217;68 is dealing right now with as this is written.

1593729,A2X17SA4E8V3PU,B009AMAOTQ,Bstrassell0001,"[8, 13]","That&#8217;s right. CBS films has brought together four incredibly gifted actors (in comedy and drama alike)&#8212;Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Kline&#8212;and places them right in the heart and soul of &#8220;Sin City.&#8221; While in Sin City, all four men will have encounters with all kinds of people: transvestites, male strippers, and nearly&#8230;50 Cent!Last Vegas stars Douglas as Billy, a bachelor nearing the age of seventy who, for the first time in his life, is finally tying the knot. His fianc&eacute;e, Lisa (Bre Blair) loves him dearly&#8212;and is only in her early thirties!Yes, with Last Vegas, you have a role that fits Michael Douglas like a glove. Not much is mentioned of his Billy Gherson&#8217;s career, but when I saw Douglas/Gherson over the phone in one of Last Vegas&#8217; opening scenes; it looked like they were making Gherson a Gordon Gekko of Malibu, California! Not sure, but even if it&#8217;s a coincidence, it&#8217;s a hilarious one.So what does a Gordon Gekko-like figure do right before he ties the knot?Answer: he forgets he&#8217;s nearly seventy and treats himself like a young child to the city of Las Vegas! Vegas are Billy Gherson&#8217;s choice of wedding location, and bachelor party&#8230;well, parties!And Mr. Gherson is not the only old man getting into trouble. Accompanying him is two of his best friends&#8230;and one estranged friend.The estranged friend is Paddy (De Niro), and it is Paddy who is the center of Last Vegas&#8217; drama. Paddy, one year earlier, lost his beloved wife Sophie and lives alone, being accompanied only by an annoying resident of his apartment who serves him tasteless food. But that isn&#8217;t Paddy&#8217;s biggest problem. His biggest problem is that his childhood best friend Billy Gherson refused to attend Sophie&#8217;s funeral&#8230;and, time and time again, has only given Paddy excuses for not coming. It&#8217;s going to take literal manipulation to get Paddy to come&#8230;but he comes, mostly as the rain on Billy Gherson&#8217;s parade.The one who convinces Paddy to come is Archie (Freeman), who beautifully unleashes his diverse talent of comedy and drama (mostly comedy) into one package. Archie is the true rebel out of Billy Gherson&#8217;s &#8220;Rat Pack,&#8221; sneaking away from and lying to his family to come to Las Vegas&#8230;AFTER becoming bedridden following a stroke, no matter how mild!Last, but certainly not least, is Kevin Kline&#8217;s Sam. Sam&#8217;s adventure is, by far, the funniest: a man who thinks 50 Cent was one of the Jackson Five (remember, his legal name is Curtis Jackson) and comes to Las Vegas looking for infidelity: AT THE PERMISSION OF HIS OWN WIFE!!!The &#8220;eye candy,&#8221; meanwhile, for Sam, Archie, Paddy, and even Billy is Diana (Mary Steenburgen), a Las Vegas club singer who wins the hearts of many&#8230;and becomes a source of competition for, most notably; you guessed it&#8230;Paddy and Billy!So how does Last Vegas measure up?Ignoring the profanity, and separating film from reality, Last Vegas is one hilarious ride from top to bottom. The material itself is very profound, and the actors go hand-in-hand with it. We see actors with infamous &#8220;dark sides,&#8221; most notably Michael Douglas and Robert De Niro, going at each other&#8217;s throats. The greatest match, however, is De Niro and Kevin Kline. Together, De Niro and Kline feed off each other&#8217;s backs, Kline as the protagonist and De Niro as the antagonist. Kline serves as De Niro&#8217;s mediator throughout the majority of Last Vegas, and even though Kline serves humorously as De Niro serves seriously, the pair still manages to go hand-in-hand like&#8230;you guessed it, spaghetti and meatballs!I found the performances of De Niro and Douglas to be the most profound, with the personal connection Douglas has to his character, and De Niro combining the dark and comedic sides that made us love him in films like Raging Bull and Meet the Parents! De Niro&#8217;s Paddy character, at times, makes Last Vegas feel like a soap opera. The drama itself, however, is necessary for the honesty of Last Vegas&#8230;and leads to a very satisfying ending. Even when we get annoyed with Paddy, De Niro keeps us watching, in a performance worthy of a Golden Globe or even Academy Award.One of the very best comedies of 2013.",4,What happens in Vegas...won't stay there forever!,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,4377,"['8217', 's', 'right', 'CBS', 'films', 'brought', 'together', 'four', 'incredibly', 'gifted', 'actors', 'comedy', 'drama', 'alike', '8212', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Kevin', 'Kline', '8212', 'places', 'right', 'heart', 'soul', '8220', 'Sin', 'City.', '8221', 'Sin', 'City', 'four', 'men', 'will', 'have', 'encounters', 'kinds', 'people', 'transvestites', 'male', 'strippers', 'nearly', '8230', '50', 'Cent', 'Last', 'Vegas', 'stars', 'Douglas', 'Billy', 'bachelor', 'nearing', 'age', 'seventy', 'who', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'finally', 'tying', 'knot', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Lisa', 'Bre', 'Blair', 'dearly', '8212', 'only', 'early', 'thirties', 'Yes', 'Last', 'Vegas', 'have', 'role', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'glove', 'Not', 'much', 'mentioned', 'Billy', 'Gherson', '8217', 'career', 'when', 'saw', 'Douglas/Gherson', 'phone', 'one', 'Last', 'Vegas', '8217', 'opening', 'scenes', 'looked', 'were', 'making', 'Gherson', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'Malibu', 'California', 'Not', 'sure', 'even', '8217', 's', 'coincidence', '8217', 's', 'hilarious', 'one.So', 'what', 'Gordon', 'Gekko-like', 'figure', 'do', 'right', 'knot', 'Answer', '8217', 'nearly', 'seventy', 'young', 'child', 'city', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Vegas', 'are', 'Billy', 'Gherson', '8217', 's', 'choice', 'wedding', 'location', 'bachelor', 'party', '8230', 'well', 'parties', 'Mr.', 'Gherson', 'not', 'only', 'old', 'man', 'getting', 'trouble', 'Accompanying', 'two', 'best', 'friends', '8230', 'one', 'estranged', 'friend.The', 'estranged', 'friend', 'Paddy', 'De', 'Niro', 'Paddy', 'who', 'center', 'Last', 'Vegas', '8217', 'drama', 'Paddy', 'one', 'year', 'earlier', 'lost', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Sophie', 'alone', 'being', 'accompanied', 'only', 'annoying', 'resident', 'apartment', 'who', 'tasteless', 'food', 'isn', '8217', 'Paddy', '8217', 'biggest', 'problem', 'biggest', 'problem', 'childhood', 'best', 'friend', 'Billy', 'Gherson', 'refused', 'attend', 'Sophie', '8217', 'funeral', '8230', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'only', 'given', 'Paddy', 'excuses', 'not', 'coming', '8217', 'going', 'take', 'literal', 'manipulation', 'get', 'Paddy', 'come', '8230', 'mostly', 'rain', 'Billy', 'Gherson', '8217', 'parade.The', 'one', 'who', 'Paddy', 'come', 'Archie', 'Freeman', 'who', 'beautifully', 'diverse', 'talent', 'comedy', 'drama', 'mostly', 'comedy', 'one', 'package', 'Archie', 'true', 'rebel', 'Billy', 'Gherson', '8217', '8220', 'Rat', 'Pack', '8221', 'sneaking', 'away', 'lying', 'family', 'come', 'Las', 'Vegas', '8230', 'AFTER', 'becoming', 'bedridden', 'following', 'stroke', 'matter', 'how', 'mild', 'Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'Kevin', 'Kline', '8217', 'Sam', 'Sam', '8217', 's', 'adventure', 'far', 'funniest', 'man', 'who', '50', 'Cent', 'was', 'one', 'Jackson', 'Five', 'remember', 'legal', 'name', 'Curtis', 'Jackson', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'looking', 'infidelity', 'AT', 'THE', 'PERMISSION', 'HIS', 'OWN', 'WIFE', '8220', 'eye', 'candy', '8221', 'meanwhile', 'Sam', 'Archie', 'Paddy', 'even', 'Billy', 'Diana', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'club', 'singer', 'who', 'hearts', 'many', '8230', 'source', 'competition', 'most', 'notably', 'guessed', '8230', 'Paddy', 'Billy', 'So', 'how', 'Last', 'Vegas', 'measure', 'up', 'Ignoring', 'profanity', 'separating', 'film', 'reality', 'Last', 'Vegas', 'one', 'hilarious', 'ride', 'top', 'bottom', 'material', 'very', 'profound', 'actors', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', 'see', 'actors', 'infamous', '8220', 'dark', 'sides', '8221', 'most', 'notably', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'going', 'other', '8217', 's', 'throats', 'greatest', 'match', 'however', 'De', 'Niro', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Together', 'De', 'Niro', 'Kline', 'feed', 'off', 'other', '8217', 's', 'backs', 'Kline', 'protagonist', 'De', 'Niro', 'antagonist', 'Kline', 'De', 'Niro', '8217', 'mediator', 'majority', 'Last', 'Vegas', 'even', 'Kline', 'humorously', 'De', 'Niro', 'seriously', 'pair', 'still', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', '8230', 'guessed', 'spaghetti', 'meatballs', 'found', 'performances', 'De', 'Niro', 'Douglas', 'be', 'most', 'profound', 'personal', 'connection', 'Douglas', 'character', 'De', 'Niro', 'combining', 'dark', 'comedic', 'sides', 'made', 'love', 'films', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'De', 'Niro', '8217', 'Paddy', 'character', 'times', 'Last', 'Vegas', 'feel', 'soap', 'opera', 'drama', 'however', 'necessary', 'honesty', 'Last', 'Vegas', '8230', 'very', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Even', 'when', 'get', 'annoyed', 'Paddy', 'De', 'Niro', 'watching', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'even', 'Academy', 'Award.One', 'very', 'best', 'comedies', '2013']",Last Vegas

1593772,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B009AMAOTQ,Darren,"[0, 0]","This is not a good movie, tbh.  The individual scenarios rest on a firm foundation of cliches.  It tries to be incessantly chipper and ultimately fails.  The funniest scene is near the beginning with Kevin Kline doing pool exercises with other seniors (&#34;it's good for my knees, but it's killing my soul&#34;); nothing else comes close to it.  Unrealistic scenes abound, like winning $100K at a blackjack table that isn't high-limit, and the entire cast running around putting fliers up all over Vegas for a bachelor party (time in movies is relative, baby) ... but really, why go on.  The film's many script problems will scarcely bother most viewers, who are understandably tired after a long day and just want to relax with familiar scenarios and familiar faces.  But in truth, the movie is almost not worth reviewing because its main business -- four 70-year-olds having a Vegas bachelor party with the usual &#34;old people jokes&#34; and unresolved business between them squeezed into the proceedings in a most contrived manner -- is so uninteresting.Those familiar faces, however, do make it worth talking about.  Douglas, Freeman, De Niro, Klein ... each of these guys have been able to carry pictures to varying degrees for as long as we can remember; they've entertained us for the better part of four decades now.  Including Klein, by the way: I've been reading comments here that he's miscast because he's too young.  News flash! -- he's 66 years old.  Believe it or not.  If anything, at 76, Freeman is too *old* for the role.  I quit being invested in the film early on and was instead invested in the actors themselves, and their strange role in my life.  As a small child in the early 70s, I remember Freeman on PBS's &#34;Electric Company&#34; program for children.  Here, he says, &#34;I'll be OK if I take my damn pills.  Or I won't be OK and I'll just die.&#34;  I remember Michael Douglas from &#34;The Streets of San Francisco&#34; where he was the cocky young foil to Karl Malden's crusty old cop.  Young and cocky then; dyed hair and fake teeth now.  Because of those age-defying accountrements, Douglas looks older than the rest of the cast.  Remember De Niro as the solemn young Don from &#34;Godfather II&#34;?  Where did that man go, and who is the squat wrinkly-faced man who has taken his place?  And has Kline gone completely silver now?  I don't think I've ever been so depressed by a movie.  All unintentionally, of course: we're mostly meant to laugh, and maybe shed a tear or two near the end.  But for those of us in mid-life, who first saw these men when we were children and when they were young men in their physical prime, &#34;Last Vegas&#34; (even the title depresses) might open up a yawning abyss: a future of Viagra and fearing to die alone while wearing a bathrobe and eating soup.  Pool exercises.  I'm not looking forward to it ... but then, I wasn't looking forward to thinning hair and expanding waistline when I was handsome young dude, and yet here I am.  (And there I'll be in that bathrobe, someday. C'est la vie!)Since the advent of movies, film actors have played a strange and complicated role in our lives.  We have little relationships with them (for some, this becomes a neurosis, obviously), because we see them so often, more often than most of our own blood relations who live in different states, for example.  We expect certain behavior from them in their &#34;stories&#34; because each actor tends to specialize in certain roles.  (I think many people expect to see Morgan Freeman as God after they die.)  We watch them slowly age, and then finally grow old.  In other words?  A movie like this carries some unexpected baggage.  At one point, the movie directly addresses the issue without the jokes.  &#34;It's all winding up too fast,&#34; Douglas says tearfully.  &#34;My brain can't even conceive what's going on with this body.&#34;  The film's focus on late-life romance or even just having fun is a positive message about aging, a condition that is, after all, better than the Alternative.  The Golden Years can be just that, if we're healthy enough and active enough.  Why die until you're dead?  But I'm not sure the message obviates that darker side of aging that Douglas briefly articulates near the movie's end: it all winds up too fast.  &#34;Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and is heard no more.&#34;  All the prostate jokes in the world won't alter that basic fact.3 out of 5: the second star for unintended poignance, the third star for our collective affection for these fine actors who have beguiled us with their talent for so many years.",3,"Out, out, brief

Maybe it the fact that there is too much star power in this film that makes every ones acting seem sub par. It's hard to swallow that that the Flatbush Four, the guys, could or would pull off a Vegas road trip and bachelor party in their 60's. They're bad ass kids doing sassy Flatbush things one minute, them they are beat up old dudes going for that one last kisk ass party in the kick ass party town, Las Vegas. Kevin Kline's wife even gives him a Viagra and a condom and tells him &#34;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas&#34; as he's leaving for the airport. De Niro is a flat bound old dude that is not over losing his wife of many years. Freeman is an old dude who's being reversed parented by his son and Douglas is an almost believable Malibu big shot who proposes at his mentor's funeral. They get to Vegas and into the penthouse bungalow at the Aria and then jump in to the Vegas scene with a bunch of 20-30 somethings. You can guess where it goes from there. I often wonder why excellent thespians make really bad movies from time to time, I'm pretty sure its for the money.

So much time has passed that my memories of &#34;Last V&#34; have largely evaporated. It's really no wonder, because even though &#34;Last V&#34; features four Oscar-winning powerhouses (Michael Douglas as Billy, Robert De Niro as Paddy, Morgan Freeman as Archie, and Kevin Kline as Sam) having a wild, invigorating fling in one of the most outrageous cities in the world, it's only moderately enjoyable and surprisingly transient.&#34;The Golden Guys&#34; used to be close friends as pre-teens but, almost inevitably have grown apart and grown old. Each of the guys has his geriatric cross to bear, including languishing from children's overprotectiveness (Archie), lonely widowerhood (Paddy), or marital boredom and impotence (Sam). Only Billy seems to have really &#34;made it&#34; as some sort of  wheeler-dealer in some unspecified business. With Gordon Gekko hair, bleached choppers, and a complexion that makes George Hamilton look like an albino, formerly confirmed bachelor Billy plans to marry a pretty young lady half his age (whom he has proposed to during a funeral!). Billy starts calling and corralling his old pals to visit him in Vegas for his pull-out-all-the-stops bachelor party. Three of the guys, eager for a last fling, accept, but Paddy morosely refuses because of a smoldering grudge he holds against Billy for not attending his wife Sophie's funeral (Billy has his reasons). Still, the other three prevail upon Paddy to attend, but Paddy seems determined to cast a grumpy pall over all the fun.The rest of &#34;Last V&#34; is basically the guys doing the usual Vegas things (like blackjack and roulette) and some off-the-beaten track things (like judging bikini contests and having trysts). Meanwhile, both Billy and Paddy make an unexpected acquaintance of a charming and wise lounge singer (Mary Steenburgen as Diana) and separately court her. Besides the Billy/Paddy feud, this romance provides what little tension and drama &#34;Last V&#34; has, not only because Billy has to decide whether to continue the relationship with Diana and abandon his marriage plans or not, but also any decision he makes will hurt Paddy again.But of course in the final analysis &#34;Last V&#34;, despite the racy and decadent Vegas environment, is a comfortably innocuous movie that reassures us that &#34;The Golden Guys&#34; and Diana will somehow make the right, happy decisions. If you like the four &#34;Old Fart&#34; legends (and who doesn't) you will generally have a good, humor-filled time.

It'll be the first time they've gotten together in many, many years.Slight plot spoilers: De Niro's character has held a grudge against Douglas'sfor some time-plus he's grown increasingly crusty in general with age.Naturally these 2 have to work out their problems at the party--which takesbasically the whole movie to accomplish.  Throw in Mary Steenbergen asan older struggling singer on the strip, to which both Douglas and de Niroare attracted, just to add more complications.There are a lot of digs at Michael Douglas's character for planning to marrysuch a young girl.

1593962,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009AMAOTQ,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","With so many movies coming out these days featuring nothing but the youngest of stars it's nice to see a movie come out with major actors getting on in age taking the leading roles. It's even better when that movie is not only well made but one of the funniest things to come out in quite some time.The Flatbush Four is a group of teens in the 50s who have their own so called gang. The promise of being friends forever takes a turn for the worse but we don't know why, except that years later as one gets married the tale unfolds. Approaching 70, Billy (Michael Douglas) decides to wed the girlfriend half his age. He calls his friends Archie (Morgan Freeman) and Sam (Kevin Kline) and arranges them to meet him in Vegas to celebrate with a bachelor party. He also charges them with contacting and bringing Paddy (Robert DeNiro), his best friend who he hasn't spoken to in over a year.Each member of the group has their own item to bring to the table. Archie had a stroke the year before and his son won't let him do anything resulting in his having to sneak out. Sam is living in a retirement community with his wife and bored silly so his wife presents him with the gift of a free pass while in Vegas to do whatever and come back the man she once knew. And Paddy has become a recluse, still dealing with the death of his wife, the love of his life and the only female welcomed into the group when they were kids.The foursome arrives in Vegas and immediately tempers flare in the form of Paddy. It takes a while but eventually we learn that Billy didn't make it to Paddy's wife's funeral, something he won't forgive Billy for missing. While it still bothers him he eventually sets that aside to be part of the bachelor party.Things get started when the group discovers that the rooms they had booked won't be ready for another year as the hotel is under renovations. While there they hear a woman singing their old songs, Diana (Mary Steenburgen), in the lounge. They're captivated and remember good times. Making friends with Diana, she helps them find their way through Vegas to the hotel where Billy is supposed to be getting married. While waiting for rooms, Archie finds a way to make their weekend in Vegas more memorable (no I won't spoil that for you).Soon the group is staying in the penthouse and getting involved in all sorts of major over the top events. They judge a bikini contest poolside. They party at the exclusive club on top of the hotel (one of the funniest scenes takes place there and involves Red Bull, vodka and Freeman). During it all Billy begins to wonder if he's making the right decision while at the same time attracted to Diana. The problem is so is Paddy.But the focus of the film isn't the problems that these two have even though they pop up periodically and are eventually settled before the film ends. The movie is more about the camaraderie between the four men from the time they were boys until now in their waning years. Friendship knows no bounds nor does it recognize age. The love shared between these four characters has served them well all this time and the trip to Vegas rekindles that love before the finish.Each of the four actors gets a chance to shine here in well worn characters that are familiar to each. DeNiro gets the tough guy, Douglas the charmer, Freeman the smooth mover and Kline the master of the witty retort. There is no way to single one out as the best but that scene with Freeman and the lines he has to deliver rapidly is fun to watch. The thing that makes this movie so good is the combination of acting, laughs and story, something that seems lacking in most movies today. Not only did I find myself invested in the story of these four friends I was also pausing the movie every now and then because I was laughing so hard.LAST VEGAS is not a movie that you'll want to rent once. It's one to add to your collection. I can already sense a bit of anticipation in myself wanting to watch it again already. Not only that I want to see these four friends reunited for another film. Let's hope that another bachelor party is in the works for the Flatbush Four.",5,FRIENDS FOREVER,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,4128,"['so', 'many', 'movies', 'coming', 'days', 'featuring', 'nothing', 'youngest', 'stars', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'major', 'actors', 'getting', 'age', 'taking', 'leading', 'roles', 'even', 'better', 'when', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'well', 'made', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', 'come', 'out', 'quite', 'time.The', 'Flatbush', 'Four', 'group', 'teens', '50s', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'so', 'called', 'gang', 'promise', 'being', 'friends', 'forever', 'turn', 'worse', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'years', 'later', 'one', 'married', 'tale', 'unfolds', 'Approaching', '70', 'Billy', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'wed', 'girlfriend', 'half', 'age', 'friends', 'Archie', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Sam', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'meet', 'Vegas', 'celebrate', 'bachelor', 'party', 'also', 'contacting', 'bringing', 'Paddy', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'best', 'friend', 'who', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'over', 'year.Each', 'member', 'group', 'own', 'item', 'bring', 'table', 'Archie', 'had', 'stroke', 'year', 'son', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'do', 'anything', 'resulting', 'having', 'sneak', 'out', 'Sam', 'living', 'retirement', 'community', 'wife', 'bored', 'silly', 'so', 'wife', 'gift', 'free', 'pass', 'Vegas', 'do', 'whatever', 'come', 'back', 'man', 'once', 'knew', 'Paddy', 'become', 'recluse', 'still', 'dealing', 'death', 'wife', 'love', 'life', 'only', 'female', 'welcomed', 'group', 'when', 'were', 'kids.The', 'foursome', 'arrives', 'Vegas', 'immediately', 'tempers', 'flare', 'form', 'Paddy', 'while', 'eventually', 'learn', 'Billy', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Paddy', 'wife', 'funeral', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'Billy', 'missing', 'still', 'eventually', 'aside', 'be', 'part', 'bachelor', 'party.Things', 'get', 'started', 'when', 'group', 'rooms', 'had', 'booked', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'ready', 'year', 'hotel', 'renovations', 'hear', 'woman', 'singing', 'old', 'songs', 'Diana', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'lounge', ""'re"", 'captivated', 'remember', 'good', 'times', 'Making', 'friends', 'Diana', 'find', 'way', 'Vegas', 'hotel', 'where', 'Billy', 'supposed', 'be', 'getting', 'married', 'waiting', 'rooms', 'Archie', 'way', 'make', 'weekend', 'Vegas', 'more', 'memorable', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', '.Soon', 'group', 'staying', 'penthouse', 'getting', 'involved', 'sorts', 'major', 'top', 'events', 'judge', 'bikini', 'contest', 'poolside', 'party', 'exclusive', 'club', 'top', 'hotel', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'place', 'there', 'Red', 'Bull', 'vodka', 'Freeman', 'Billy', 'wonder', 'making', 'right', 'decision', 'same', 'time', 'attracted', 'Diana', 'problem', 'so', 'Paddy.But', 'focus', 'film', ""n't"", 'problems', 'two', 'have', 'even', 'pop', 'up', 'periodically', 'are', 'eventually', 'settled', 'film', 'movie', 'more', 'camaraderie', 'four', 'men', 'time', 'were', 'boys', 'now', 'waning', 'years', 'Friendship', 'bounds', 'recognize', 'age', 'love', 'shared', 'four', 'characters', 'served', 'well', 'time', 'trip', 'Vegas', 'love', 'finish.Each', 'four', 'actors', 'chance', 'shine', 'here', 'well', 'worn', 'characters', 'are', 'familiar', 'DeNiro', 'tough', 'guy', 'Douglas', 'charmer', 'Freeman', 'smooth', 'mover', 'Kline', 'master', 'witty', 'retort', 'way', 'single', 'one', 'out', 'best', 'scene', 'Freeman', 'lines', 'deliver', 'rapidly', 'fun', 'watch', 'thing', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'combination', 'acting', 'laughs', 'story', 'something', 'lacking', 'most', 'movies', 'today', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'find', 'invested', 'story', 'four', 'friends', 'was', 'also', 'pausing', 'movie', 'now', 'then', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard.LAST', 'VEGAS', 'not', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'rent', 'once', 'one', 'add', 'collection', 'can', 'already', 'sense', 'bit', 'anticipation', 'wanting', 'watch', 'again', 'already', 'Not', 'only', 'want', 'see', 'four', 'friends', 'reunited', 'film', 'Let', 'hope', 'bachelor', 'party', 'works', 'Flatbush', 'Four']",Last Vegas

As the movie opens, the characters are shown as young kids growing up in Brooklyn, with also a young girl whom one of them would eventually marry. The movie then goes ""58 Years Later"", and we get introduced to each of the 4 guys, all of them dealing with a predicament of sorts. Not that it matters a lot, as it isn't long before the action shifts to Vegas where they are determined to have a grand time. They also get to know an older female jazz singer (played by Mary Steenbergen). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: I admit that I probably wouldn't have caught this movie but for the fact that I just got back from a vacation in Vegas myself and I happen to notice the movie was still playing (in the dollar theatre). I was curious what Vegas would look like in this movie, and I was not disappointed. In fact, once in a  while the location of a movie is as big a character of the movie than any of the performers, and that is certainly the case in this movie. The second big surprise for me was the performance from Mary Steenbergen (you may recall she won an Oscar more than 30 years ago for ""Melvin and Howard""). I hadn't seem her in a movie in forever, even though I know she continues to work fairly frequently in movies. This role again showcases the talents of Ms. Steenbergen. Last but certainly not least, this is of course mostly a comedy but beware, there are some poignant moments towards the end, with some great observations about getting older and how fast the years fly by.Bottom line: I had little expectations going in, but found myself amused most of the time, and couldn't stop marveling about the Vegas locations in the movie. If you've gone to Vegas, ""Last Vegas"" is a no-brainer and I would recommend it without hesitation.

1594086,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B009AMAOTQ,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 2]","I liked this, the guys 'get outta town' to Las Vegas, film directed by Jon Turteltaub.  Sure, it had the usual trappings that you may be expecting. After all, it's the bachelor party weekend for their last friend who hasn't ever been married, Billy (Michael Douglas).  Paddy (Robert De Niro) still harbors angry feelings toward Billy but went along anyway. Along with these two are Sam (Kevin Kline) and Archie (Morgan Freeman).  The four men have been friends since their childhood and remained tight all of these years.You are going to see and hear the full atmosphere of todays Las Vegas.  From the showgirls, loud music, and luck playing Black Jack, in a Vegas that is as large as another character. There are a couple of things included that I didn't expect like the lovely Torch Singer, Diana (Mary Steenburgen) who sings in one of the lesser casinos.  It is interesting as she is closer to their age, which is totally unlike Billy's 31'ish' fiance. Diana spends a lot of time with these guys and she seems to have a way of communicating with each one in a special manner.  *She could be his daughter.  The time and place he proposed to her is oddly unexpected to say the least.There is a subplot running along concerning the relationship of Paddy and Billy.  Paddy is bitter over something that Billy did.  He will neither let up nor let him forget it. I won't get into it any further except to say that it does add more depth, and some comedy, to the movie than what you may be expecting. A nice touch in how the film also looks into the concerns of life and getting older. The story begins with these men as boys some 58 years prior to right now.  They were friends then - before the film jumps ahead to the present.  You do get to see these four boys from Brooklyn as youngsters, calling themselves, ""The Flatbush Four"".This is an easy movie to watch and enjoy.  The cast works well together and does not disappoint.  It does not delve into any deep social issues, isn't cerebral so you will not end up thinking it over and over later.

I'm not a big fan of Vegas as I hate losing money and it's too hot for me, but for those who like the city and the actors and comedies, they'll probably enjoy the film. One of the characters takes alot of ribbing as he's engaged to a woman nearly half his age, but I'm so used to famous actors of a certain age marrying much younger women, that that story element didn't seem a big deal to me, and I didn't really think men would give their men friends a hard time about marrying much younger in real life, probably congratulate him. The characters had health issues which I could relate to, but it was nice to see older characters kicking up their heels abit. One of the character's wives gave him permission to cheat on her during the Vegas trip, which I didn't find believable - just have never heard of a wife giving her husband permission to cheat at a bachelor party, though do concede it is possible and of course I know some people have open marriages. 2 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 3, mostly for the acting.

If you are tired of the whole Hangover shtick that has been throbbing your cinema screens for 4 years, wait till you give a chance and look no further than a better-written, much funnier, less mean-spirited, and somewhat more human take on four guys and life in Vegas with this film, Last Vegas (a pun of its own). Despite its joy and thankfully, the film does not promote gambling, alcohol consumption, or excess.Freeman, Douglas, DeNiro, Kline, and a witty performance from Steenburgen all provide great and humorous performances as cantankerous old men reconciling after Douglas' character (Billy, from California) tries to invite them all to Vegas in light of his upcoming wedding. The film soon boils down to a story about trust, loyalty, and how friends can make irrational decisions for the sake of proving something but the film never deters to a level where the drama overemphasises the script and the comedy reigns high (which is what The Hangover Part III did not manage to do very well with its bizarre mix of dark comedy, crime thriller, and sex farce).While the film may seem Hollywoodised and sentimental at parts, I did not get this reaction but it felt the tone, treatment, and the whole film was done just right. All of the gang (especially the normally dry and intelligent Freeman) bring their relaxed chemistry into the film and provide some hilarious scenes involving a VIP entry, dealing with some young egotistical show-off, Freeman walking out of his house, and getting drunk off martinis.It is not a perfect film but it certainly is a nice treat for older audiences to reconcile their past and feel like living again in a similar way that The Bucket List achieved this feat. Unlike another film that deals with reconciliation and pastime memories/behaviour like The World's End (1990s instead of the 1950s), this is not a fantasy or an outlandish scenario piece and nor does it have the kind of aggressive raunch (but this film does have quite a few sexual references itself too) or violence found in The Hangover too making it more appropriate for the 50+ crowd.&#34;",4,"Tired of The Hangover, why not take a capsule of Last Vegas.

Four old friends (with some old issues between) them take off for a raucous weekend in Sin City. The emphasis here is on &#34;old&#34; - but the 60-70 crowd still has plenty of life left in them. An improbable stroke of luck near the start of their outing makes wild extravagance almost plausible, but that just makes it more fun. Things like over-attentive adult children, mid-life (maybe late-life) crises, getting back to wild times after a few decades of married peace and quiet, sorrow and recovery from being widowed - all carried off flawlessly. And, it doesn't hurt to be reminded that &#34;retired&#34; and &#34;dead&#34; are different words for good reason. Every decade is a good one, or can be, just not all in the same ways.BTW, if someone pans the movie, check whether they're under 50.
