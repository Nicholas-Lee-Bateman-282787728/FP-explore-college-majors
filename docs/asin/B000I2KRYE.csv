1019020,AYRGWH1DJT0PB,B000I2KRYE,DrakeScott,"[0, 0]","Unwaveringly abysmal acting and a truly lame screenplay relegate this straw-headed clunker to the back fields of lucky-to-be straight-to-video obscurity. If there's any good news here, it's that DARK HARVEST 3 manages to be better than DH2, but then, nearly anything would - even this sloppy, frightless, and amateurish excursion into tropeville. It isn't just derivative, it's *awfully* derivative, in the most literal sense; the dedicated horror fan will easily recognize the influence of several better films that have been ruthlessly pillaged for ideas, which are then shamelessly fumbled. I won't say ""don't watch this"" outright, because the aforementioned (and astoundingly terrible) performances by everyone might qualify the movie for a certain ""so bad it's good"" notoriety in some circles. To wit, in lieu of actually emoting, the actors either shout their lines repeatedly, emit bizarre sounds, or engage in behavior so odd that it's distracting (one character, when frightened, begins audibly sniffing the air and the coat she's hiding behind; another offers a shaken woman an obviously empty cup, which she pretends to sip). This one irrevocably confirms the long-held suspicion of many that Lionsgate will put their name on anything.",2,"A Sloppy, Frightless, and Amateurish Excursion into Tropeville",1254960000,"10 8, 2009",2009,1246,"['Unwaveringly', 'abysmal', 'acting', 'truly', 'lame', 'screenplay', 'relegate', 'straw-headed', 'clunker', 'back', 'fields', 'lucky-to-be', 'straight-to-video', 'obscurity', 'good', 'news', 'here', 'DARK', 'HARVEST', '3', 'manages', 'be', 'better', 'DH2', 'then', 'nearly', 'anything', 'would', 'even', 'sloppy', 'frightless', 'amateurish', 'excursion', 'tropeville', ""n't"", 'just', 'derivative', '*awfully*', 'derivative', 'most', 'literal', 'sense', 'dedicated', 'horror', 'fan', 'will', 'easily', 'recognize', 'influence', 'several', 'better', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'ruthlessly', 'pillaged', 'ideas', 'are', 'then', 'shamelessly', 'fumbled', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'outright', 'aforementioned', 'astoundingly', 'terrible', 'performances', 'everyone', 'might', 'qualify', 'movie', 'certain', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'notoriety', 'circles', 'wit', 'lieu', 'actually', 'emoting', 'actors', 'shout', 'lines', 'repeatedly', 'emit', 'bizarre', 'sounds', 'engage', 'behavior', 'so', 'odd', 'distracting', 'one', 'character', 'when', 'frightened', 'audibly', 'sniffing', 'air', 'coat', 'hiding', 'shaken', 'woman', 'obviously', 'empty', 'cup', 'sip', 'one', 'irrevocably', 'long-held', 'suspicion', 'many', 'Lionsgate', 'will', 'put', 'name', 'anything']",Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow

1019022,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B000I2KRYE,Julian Kennedy,"[0, 0]","Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow (Skarecrow): 1 out of 10: In Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity there is the Theory of Time Dilation... Light travels at a constant speed regardless of the speed of its source. Since the movie itself moves at the speed of an arthritic sloth, the light emitted seems to actually slow time. (Reports of a Fermi Liquid emitting from the DVD player are to this date unconfirmed.) As a result this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change. Even on fast-forward (And you will be reaching for that fast forward button) it clocks in somewhere around eternity.If you are familiar with Lionsgate's own version of Project Greenlight (This is where they buy a home movie, put a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local Wal-Mart), you will not be surprised by the complete and utter lack of entertainment value contained within. To make matters worse this is marketed as part of the Dark Harvest series though the film was made years before and has nothing to do with that lame movie. It is as if you bought an unreleased Mighty Ducks sequel and tried to pass it off as a Friday The 13th film.The line reading (I refuse to call it acting) is uniformly awful. This is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between cans of Schlitz. The camera work is of drunken father shooting vacation film quality. In addition, while the special effects are okay; the most freighting moment is the breast augmentation scars in the nude scene.The story is awful, the sets are from a Haunted Halloween put on by ADHD middle school students and once again the line reading (remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming) is distracting beyond mere words. Avoid at all costs, lest you find yourself ageing faster than your loved ones.Lord knows you wouldn't want to see even still shots of the film so here is some art.",1,Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow (Skarecrow)...

1019025,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B000I2KRYE,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","Lions Gate movie and not something Asylum did. The acting was extremely bad. A nasty young man inherits a cabin in the woods that is cursed by the voodoo woman who they ejected. While he is arguing with his gf near a scarecrow, he punches/slaps her to the ground and spills some blood, I think. The movie isn't too coherent in anything. At one point they go into the basement and get a book. This is apparently some voodoo book. There are still animal bones (and a dog's skull) hanging from the basement ceiling which no one seemed to notice or care. They carried the leather bound book upstairs, but when one of the girls touches the book she passes out. Why? What was in the book? Why her and not those who carried the book? It seems to disappear from the story, possibly having to go back to the set of The Evil Dead.There is some nudity in the movie for the sake of nudity. The first nude shot was of a female torso which had no face attached to it and clearly didn't belong to the woman it was supposed to be connected. And the scarecrow that comes to life, is missing half his right arm before he becomes animated, then suddenly has a whole one. What was really sad was that this stinker movie was dedicated to the loving memory of Ben Dixon's (director/writer/producer) father. Of course I really don't know what kind of relationship they had.",1,I CAN' T BELIEVE THIS IS A,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,1350,"['Lions', 'Gate', 'movie', 'not', 'something', 'Asylum', 'did', 'acting', 'was', 'extremely', 'bad', 'nasty', 'young', 'man', 'cabin', 'woods', 'cursed', 'voodoo', 'woman', 'who', 'ejected', 'arguing', 'gf', 'scarecrow', 'ground', 'blood', 'think', 'movie', ""n't"", 'too', 'coherent', 'anything', 'one', 'point', 'go', 'basement', 'get', 'book', 'apparently', 'voodoo', 'book', 'are', 'still', 'animal', 'bones', 'dog', 'skull', 'hanging', 'basement', 'ceiling', 'one', 'seemed', 'notice', 'care', 'carried', 'leather', 'bound', 'book', 'upstairs', 'when', 'one', 'girls', 'book', 'out', 'Why', 'What', 'was', 'book', 'Why', 'not', 'who', 'carried', 'book', 'disappear', 'story', 'possibly', 'having', 'go', 'back', 'set', 'Evil', 'Dead.There', 'nudity', 'movie', 'sake', 'nudity', 'first', 'nude', 'shot', 'was', 'female', 'torso', 'had', 'face', 'attached', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'woman', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'connected', 'scarecrow', 'life', 'missing', 'right', 'arm', 'animated', 'then', 'suddenly', 'whole', 'one', 'What', 'was', 'really', 'sad', 'was', 'stinker', 'movie', 'was', 'dedicated', 'loving', 'memory', 'Ben', 'Dixon', 'director/writer/producer', 'father', 'course', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'relationship', 'had']",Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow
