1683455,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00H47IWES,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[3, 3]","Sword of the Assassin is beautifully photographed. I wish that I could say more about the story and the film itself. The movie was predictable, and moved at a snail's pace. Oh the ending was a little bit of a surprise, none of us saw that coming; but it just took so long to get there.The photography is so beautiful. Every scene is tack sharp, perfectly lit, and the sound recorded to perfection. The special effects with people flying around and the force wave effect are well done. The fight scenes are not nearly the ballet of Crouching Tiger, they are still well done and pretty. In general the acting is good with the exception of one character that appears to be reading his lines. The hero of the story and his female counterpart were very good.Where the film lost me was the story telling. The film is nearly two hours long and is well over a half hour too long. The fighting scenes weren't long enough. And the transition scenes were just oh so long and difficult to sit through. The flashbacks worked the first few times, and then got old and not so effective, and by the fifteenth flashback that was enough. The director could have used dramatic framing (he had an amazing cinematographer); instead he chose to use the center of the frame for virtually every shot.The special effects and acrobatics were well done, with one painful exception. Near the end of the film, there is a fighting exercise in a forest. It is raining, well it is raining on one person, but the other person nearby is dry. At one point the wet person flies up into the trees and we could see the water hoses gushing water, the rain turned horizontal at that point. This may sound like a small thing. It is sad that we actually noticed this in the film; obviously we were not as excited about the film and looking for entertainment elsewhere on the screen.The film is not rated. There is no nudity or strong language. Of course there are fight scenes where a lot of people are killed. The fight scenes are not gory or blood soaked, they are done with style. I would guess the film would be rated PG-13 if it were rated by the MPAA. It is probably safe for younger viewers. The film is presented in Vietnamese with English subtitles (there may be a dubbed version, I'm not that great with Blu-Ray disk audio selection).This was an expensive big production. It is beautifully photographed in a gorgeous country. The fight scenes are good and well choreographed. The film was just too long.I was provided with a review copy.",3,Beautiful And Too Long,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,2505,"['Sword', 'Assassin', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'more', 'story', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'predictable', 'moved', 'snail', 'pace', 'Oh', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'surprise', 'none', 'saw', 'coming', 'just', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'there.The', 'photography', 'so', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'tack', 'sharp', 'perfectly', 'lit', 'sound', 'recorded', 'perfection', 'special', 'effects', 'people', 'flying', 'around', 'force', 'wave', 'effect', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'ballet', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'are', 'still', 'well', 'done', 'pretty', 'general', 'acting', 'good', 'exception', 'one', 'character', 'be', 'reading', 'lines', 'hero', 'story', 'female', 'counterpart', 'were', 'very', 'good.Where', 'film', 'lost', 'was', 'story', 'telling', 'film', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'well', 'half', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'long', 'enough', 'transition', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'oh', 'so', 'long', 'difficult', 'sit', 'flashbacks', 'worked', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'then', 'got', 'old', 'not', 'so', 'effective', 'fifteenth', 'flashback', 'was', 'enough', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'dramatic', 'framing', 'had', 'amazing', 'cinematographer', 'instead', 'chose', 'use', 'center', 'frame', 'virtually', 'shot.The', 'special', 'effects', 'acrobatics', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'painful', 'exception', 'end', 'film', 'fighting', 'exercise', 'forest', 'raining', 'well', 'raining', 'one', 'person', 'other', 'person', 'nearby', 'dry', 'one', 'point', 'wet', 'person', 'up', 'trees', 'could', 'see', 'water', 'gushing', 'water', 'rain', 'turned', 'horizontal', 'point', 'may', 'sound', 'small', 'thing', 'sad', 'actually', 'noticed', 'film', 'obviously', 'were', 'not', 'excited', 'film', 'looking', 'entertainment', 'elsewhere', 'screen.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'nudity', 'strong', 'language', 'course', 'are', 'fight', 'scenes', 'where', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'gory', 'blood', 'soaked', 'are', 'done', 'style', 'would', 'guess', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'were', 'rated', 'MPAA', 'probably', 'safe', 'younger', 'viewers', 'film', 'presented', 'Vietnamese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'may', 'be', 'dubbed', 'version', ""'m"", 'not', 'great', 'Blu-Ray', 'disk', 'audio', 'selection', '.This', 'was', 'expensive', 'big', 'production', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'gorgeous', 'country', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'choreographed', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'long.I', 'was', 'provided', 'review', 'copy']",Sword of the Assassin
1683456,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00H47IWES,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 7]","There is a veritable treasure trove of Eastern (i.e. Asian, Japanese, Chinese, and other national or cultural influences) that deserve to find wider recognition within the United States, and &#8211; for the life of me &#8211; I&#8217;ve never understood why.  To a certain degree, I can understand why some audiences shy away from motion pictures with subtitles, but when the quality is there I think viewers would understandably embrace these films because their lessons tend to be universal.  In fact, I&#8217;d argue that films like SWORD OF THE ASSASSIN have most of the ingredients people want in a story &#8211; there&#8217;s always a bit of magic, mystery, and mysticism wrapped around a central story that inevitably boils down to a grand ol&#8217; good-versus-evil battle to the finish.What more could one want?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)As a young child, Nguyen Vu (played by Hyunh Dong) washes ashore on a lake adjoining a temple guarded over by a lone monk.  Raised in this solitude, all the youngster has to occupy his time is the perfecting of his martial arts &#8211; it would seem that Vu has been gifted with some great abilities, yet he&#8217;s been unable to bring them under his control.  Twelve years later, the monk reveals to the young man the true past, that he&#8217;s the last survivor of a family sentenced to death by royal decree; and, if he is to finally find peace in this world, he will have to confront this evil and allow his ancestors some comfort in the afterlife.  In order to make this happen, Vu will have to join forces with a displaced prince harboring a secret and a fierce young woman who&#8217;s deadly with a sword.  Together, they might manage to change the world, provided they can survive long enough to see it happen.SWORD OF THE ASSASSIN is a movie lover&#8217;s delight.  It has a bit of everything wrapped up into its story &#8211; palace intrigue, terrific action sequences, and both heroes and villains struggling to some degree with their own respective moral quandaries.  As often happens in tales of this nature, Vu&#8217;s relatives were wrongly accused in part of a scheme to cause a change within the royal line; and he&#8217;s not the only one with his eyes set on storming the castle to clear his family name.  As he&#8217;s quick to learn, kings and queens are very skilled at making enemies.I&#8217;ve read elsewhere (on the web) that SWORD is one of the first Vietnamese films to truly experiment with epic storytelling of this nature, and, if that&#8217;s true, director Victor Vu (who also served in part on the team that adapted the screenplay from a beloved novel) certainly was in the right place at the right time.  I&#8217;d imagine that much of the narrative success of the picture is due to his firm grasp of the material as well as knowing how to bring it all together in such a winning concoction.  He certainly manages to get some great marks out of his performers, fashioning them into characters who clearly understand their motivations and how all of their stories intertwine.Naturally, this isn&#8217;t to say that the film isn&#8217;t without a few blemishes.  Some of the wire-fu sequences are perhaps a bit more elaborate than should&#8217;ve been staged in a first go-round, but kudos for keeping it ambitious.  Also, the period detail is quite good, but it fails in my opinion to rise to the level of being award-winning; for example, much of the period-wear of the main players is constantly too clean to legitimately belong to peasants of the era.  Lastly, there&#8217;s a necessary reliance on CGI in (thankfully) only a handful of sequences; while the arrangements are also quite good, they&#8217;re really only rendered at the level of what some Western and/or European film studios are producing for television, not in big budget motion pictures.So far as the story is concerned, SWORD rises admirably to the occasion.  It might feel a bit overwrought at times, but such is the nature of how these epic tales get told.  There are plenty of plot points stuffed in there &#8211; honor, humility, compassion, betrayal &#8211; and, at times, characters tell audiences how they feel when it would&#8217;ve been more organic to show it.  In the end, much of what&#8217;s explored has to deal with coming to terms with whatever hand life has dealt you.  One can accept a cruel fate, but then has to reconcile that acceptance with the corresponding anger.  Sadly &#8211; as Vu learns &#8211; sometimes the only way to achieve a measure of peace is to force oneself to live with it.SWORD OF THE ASSASSIN (aka BLOOD LETTER) [2012] is produced by Saiga Films.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by Epic Pictures.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Vietnamese-spoken-language release with English subtitles available.  (To my knowledge, there is no English-dubbed track.)  As for the technical specifications, the film is smartly assembled along with some wonderful high-quality sights and sounds; some of the effects sequences aren&#8217;t exactly up-to-par by Western standards, but I didn&#8217;t find that it diminished my enjoyment of the film in the slightest.  Sadly &#8211; as is often the case when these smaller foreign pictures find release on American shores &#8211; there are no special features to speak of save the theatrical trailer.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  SWORD OF THE ASSASSIN (aka BLOOD LETTER) may lack some of the finer spit polish of similar Eastern films in the subject matter of epic tales, but its heart is clearly in the right place.  Part-fantasy, part-romance, and part-period piece, director Victor Vu maintains a firm grasp on the material, marshaling the creative forces of all involved from its gritty beginning, through its surreal encounters, and up until its big finish.  He knows when to let it ruminate and when to let it flourish, and, under his command, his cast delivers a winner.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Epic Pictures provided me with a DVD copy of SWORD OF THE ASSASSIN by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review, and their decision to do so has influenced my estimation in no way,

1683458,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00H47IWES,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 6]","The Vietnamese martial arts actioner ""Sword of the Assassin"" is one of those films that deserves to be embraced by a wider audience, but perhaps should not be oversold as a brilliant new epic. It's worth seeing, for sure, but it is fairly uneven in tone (especially toward the beginning). That said, I think its charms will sneak up on you if you aren't coming into the experience loaded with preconceived ideas. Released in 2012, Vu's film opened with the less generic title of ""Blood Letter"" and the new moniker ""Sword of the Assassin"" doesn't do much to distinguish it from the crowded martial arts film field. And that's a shame because the story it tells is far more interesting and complex than comparable fare. The film was a critical success in Vietnam winning a fist full of Golden Kite Awards including Best Feature Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Cinematography and Best Sound. This bold endeavor, cited as one of the most expensive movies ever made in its native land, boast interesting visuals, good effects and fight sequences, and a terrifically twisty saga spanning two decades of political intrigue.The movie successfully combines elements of various genres and even introduces a touch of fantasy in its opening moments. The story begins when a young boy takes up residence in a monastery. His parents were executed due to suspicions surrounding the death of the reigning monarch. Twelve years later, when that boy is a bona fide warrior, he begins to piece together a complicated back story about his family and vows to discover the truth. On his journey, he meets contemporary power players, others that were victimized by events from long ago, and various factions that both seek to uncover and/or cover-up the truth of what happened twelve years prior. The battle for supremacy has never really ended, and a Blood Letter promises to anoint a new leader after uncovering past deceptions. It leads to surprises, betrayal, and bloodshed but to reveal more of the plot is to really do a disservice to the movie.If I'm being honest, I didn't love the first half of ""Sword of the Assassin."" It's entertaining enough, a bit of fun if you will, but it doesn't have the gravitas that this great plot line needs. When the boy comes into the city, he is portrayed as a comedic bumpkin. And when he meets a young lady, the banter is a bit stiff and predictable opting for lightness as opposed to real emotion. As the movie progresses, though, and focuses on the quest for the Blood Letter, it does get much better. This had the potential to be both powerful and impactful, but often played things with a breezy tone that doesn't fit the seriousness of the story line. As the body count rises, the stakes do deepen and real emotional consequence enters the picture. A last minute betrayal and the presence of a creepy bald villain enhance the drama considerably.""Sword of the Assassin"" uses fantastical effects that defy gravity for its action set pieces. While I have wearied over these sequences over recent years, they are used effectively here. I particularly liked one moment when an assassin emerged from the water to settle old scores. Overall, the star (for me) of ""Sword of the Assassin"" is its plot. With so many movies relying only on fight scenes, this was one movie that had a real story to tell. Vu's film isn't perfect, but it doesn't lack ambition. I think this might have made an remarkable epic with a slight shift in tone for the first half.

1683459,A1M2UIO0DNLH1S,B00H47IWES,L. Nguyen,"[1, 1]","I have to admit even though I am Vietnamese I grew up watching tons of Chinese movies. As you can see from my past reviews and also my Listmania that I have watched a lot. I didn't really watch a whole lot of Vietnamese movies because 1) the acting and movies that I remember were over the top and 2) my parents soured me on any experience because every movie they had was not that great. I just remember trying to watch this one Vietnamese martial art film and was not impressed at all by the costumes, the fighting choreography or the acting. It was painful to finish that one and maybe it was unfair- but I never watched anything else from Vietnam for quite awhile. Comparing the 80s Vietnamese films to the 80s Chinese films and you have a huge difference. I would say that the Vietnamese films are about 10 years behind the Chinese ones even back then.The only other films that I have seen were Cyclo and The Scent of Papaya.  Both weren't martial art films so I would have to say that I approached this with an open mind.I watched more out of curiosity since I have read other viewers compare this to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I would have to say that the only similarity to that movie was the wire choreography.  To be completely honest, this wasn't the worse movie I have ever watched. Actually, I would go as far as to say that this was as decent attempt for an martial arts film in Vietnam and probably one of the better films that they have come out with in regards to this genre.In a nutshell, we have the main character who is the grandson of a nobleman of the royal court. His grandfather was implicated and framed for the murder of the King and as a result, his family was wiped out, except for the main character Nguyen Vu, who managed to escape with the help of a servant I believe. He is left in the care of an old monk at a monastery who is a friend of his grandfather's. This monk raises him and teaches him martial arts. When Nguyen Vu grows up, he learns the story of his family and of the legend of the blood letter which was written by a close eunuch to the king that witnessed what really happened and wrote down incriminating information in blood before he dies. Nguyen Vu embarks on a mission  to recover the letter and to seek justice and expose the truth. Along the way, he encounters many and he has to rely on himself to distinguish between who he can trust and who he can't. There is the regular assortment of cast members that are present in most martial films. We have the idealistic main character, we have a strong willed love interest, we have several villains, and we have friends.  All in all, the plot line was a tad bit weak. This movie was based on a book by  Bui Anh Tan which I have not read but it seems to be a lot of what has already been made by the Chinese.The good: I was actually impressed by how this was filmed. I still think that the caliber of this film is several years behind the Chinese in terms of martial arts and effects, but it wasn't that bad. The scenery was beautiful as well as the colors and lighting. It did feel like a high budget movie and not a low budget one and you can tell there was a lot put into picking out the backgrounds to film against. I have never visited Vietnam having been born here in the U. S and I was awed by how beautiful the country is. I would definitely rate the filming of the countryside as being one of the top highlights of the movie. I was also impressed by the music. It went well with the film scenes and didn't distract but enhanced in a lot of the scenes.The Meh:  The story line and plot. Again, it seemed like this was done a lot already in other movies that I have seen. I wasn't too intrigued by the plot itself or the love interest between the characters. Actually, I kinda figured out the plot twists and turns and  felt that the movie took too long on delivering the main storyline. It started out with promise with having the main character go on this important life mission, fizzled out in intensity and then trickled down into an limp ending that left me going, huh? That's it? Very anti-climatic. The movie plot didn't really suck me in or even get me involved enough to care at the end to what happened. I actually felt that this movie borrowed heavily from the Chinese influence in movies. I even saw this one part in the movie that there was a wanted poster for one of the girls in the movie and it was written in Chinese. That threw me for a loop.  And of course, utilizing the wire choreography. Whereas in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon the wiring came off as graceful and beautiful. In this movie, it was slowed down so much that it look awkward at times. And they slow-moed a lot of the choreography so that it looked fake. I mean, people are flying around- it's fake anyway but it somehow looks less fake when  it's not slowed down so much. That was my only deal.  Otherwise, the choreography was a huge improvement on what I used to remember the movies looked like on a low budget. There was a lot of stylized killing- nothing too gory.I did like the actor that played the main character, he was pretty natural and did a good job. The girl was okay she was kind of one dimensional but she was not really the main focus of the movie so they did fine casting the bigger roles. The costumes were beautiful and simple and it was interesting to see different versions of the native dress in Vietnam.The Bad: some of the actors were very wooden. I'm not sure if they were supposed to be that poker faced or not, but it definitely came off as choppy and unemotional. Namely, the main villain. I honestly am not sure if his voice was dubbed to sound so dead, but his facial expression and acting wasn't helping him either.Overall it was a solid production from Saiga Movies and I was mildly surprised by how the movie was. It exceeded my expectations slightly in terms of entertainment. It is by no means, the next Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but still a decent movie overall. If you are a casual martial arts movie watcher, this  will look good to you- but to fellow fanatics...this movie will just be okay.",3,A Solid Attempt,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,6134,"['have',
