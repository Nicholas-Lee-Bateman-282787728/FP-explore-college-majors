While the plot is not entirely unlike others, there is something about the rawness of the acting and the rawness of the landscapes, that makes Out of the Furnace one very good slow searing burn of a film, a cut above all of the rest that contain similar elements.  The movie is raw, downright raw, and brutal, so much so that you can absolutely feel the desperation and heartbreak of traditional Americana.  It feels authentic and real, and through visuals and some first rate dialogue, captures an image of old America that is crumbling to its foundations.  The beautiful America we once knew is disappearing, and Out of the Furnace captures is as perfectly as one can envision.The acting is just tremendous, and the movie's slow burn to the climactic showdown betwen Baze and Degroat feels like someone just lit a match poured some gasoline in it, and shoved it down your throat.

1658399,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00DL47YY2,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Sometimes you look at these small films that fly under the radar with reasonable reviews and find yourself a real gem.  They have powerful narratives and ample actors and they carry with them a pedigree that seems ripe for the taking, and the under the radar aspect only heightens the glisten when it really does pull something special off.  I had those high hopes for this film going in.  I love the ensemble, or at least generally respect them, and the trailer had me really excited.  The good notices yet no awards traction bolstered my anticipation because it felt like one of those small movies that had a lot to offer yet was unfairly disregarded or overlooked.And ever since 2007 I&#8217;ve been waiting for Casey Affleck to just become a really big deal.I just want to address something that has felt like a really big issue with 2013 films in particular.  Maybe I&#8217;m just being picky or overly sensitive to something, but for me this year has had its fair share of films with issues regarding the passage of time.  I found this particularly distracting in &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; and this film had the same issues.  Couple that with a real pacing problem and &#8216;Out of the Furnace&#8217; nearly burns off all its fuel not even halfway in.  The story itself is compelling, sort of, but overall the film feels extremely bogged down by a real storytelling problem.  The first half of the film seems to be centered on building up to a specific crux that we all knew was coming from the film&#8217;s advertising (brother goes missing, other brother gets mad) but in the process it just wastes so much character development in this swift passage of time.I need to take a breath and elaborate.The film opens with working man Russell plugging along at life with a hard job, a sick father, a wayward brother and a beautiful girlfriend who seems to make everything manageable.  His brother, Rodney, has a gambling problem and borrows too much, but Russell&#8217;s standup reputation saves his brother from too much consequence.  Then Russell gets drunk and makes a reckless decision that costs him years in prison.  In those years (that pass by in a few minutes) his brother goes to war, his father dies and his girlfriend leaves him for a cop.  Then Russell is a free man trying to pick up pieces of a faltered life.  His ex-girlfriend is now pregnant and his brother, back from the way with too many memories, is street fighting to pay off gambling debts.Then stuff happens and Russell finds himself in search of his brother and a backwoods (literal) gangster named Harlan DeGroat.My issue is this; the film was so concerned with getting to this final half (the search for Rodney) that the entire first half, which could have been so ripe with actual character development, feels rushed and underwritten.  It all feels like a cluttered and lazy way to throw a bunch of characters and situations at us without ever really developing anything, to the point where it all feels unnecessary.  Some of the actors are horribly underused, especially Zoe Saldana, and the tonal shift to revenge thriller in the film&#8217;s second half seems to make the first half feel like a different movie.The first half is also the far more interesting movie, despite being poorly filmed.But beyond the pacing issues, the storytelling problems and the tonal uncertainty, the film offers us a really respectable cast that anchors the film and does their best to reel us in.  Affleck is easily the standout, full of a ferocity that makes every aspect of this character so compelling.  I honestly wish the entire film had been about his character, ending right in the middle where he goes &#8216;missing&#8217;, because he was all I thought about the whole time.  It isn&#8217;t that Bale is bad here, because he&#8217;s actually very good, but Russell is easily the least interesting character in the film.  Harrelson is ruthless and chews the scenery brilliantly, and the softer shades of Sam Shepard, Willem Dafoe and Forest Whitaker&#8217;s performances really help make this ensemble sing.I just really, really wish this had been a better film.It&#8217;s beautiful to look at (the lighting captures so much), but Scott Cooper&#8217;s script is so ridiculously underdeveloped and misguided that it takes the wind out of every sail.  The film just deflates on impact, and by the time it&#8217;s over it&#8217;s completely forgotten.",3,&#8230;and into the frying pan!,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,4428,"['Sometimes', 'look', 'small', 'films', 'fly', 'radar', 'reasonable', 'reviews', 'find', 'real', 'gem', 'have', 'powerful', 'narratives', 'ample', 'actors', 'carry', 'pedigree', 'ripe', 'taking', 'radar', 'aspect', 'only', 'glisten', 'when', 'really', 'pull', 'something', 'special', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'going', 'love', 'ensemble', 'least', 'generally', 'respect', 'trailer', 'had', 'really', 'excited', 'good', 'notices', 'yet', 'awards', 'traction', 'bolstered', 'anticipation', 'felt', 'one', 'small', 'movies', 'had', 'lot', 'offer', 'yet', 'was', 'unfairly', 'disregarded', 'overlooked.And', 'ever', '2007', '8217', 'been', 'waiting', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'just', 'become', 'really', 'big', 'deal.I', 'just', 'want', 'address', 'something', 'felt', 'really', 'big', 'issue', '2013', 'films', 'particular', 'Maybe', '8217', 'm', 'just', 'being', 'picky', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'something', 'year', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'films', 'issues', 'regarding', 'passage', 'time', 'found', 'particularly', 'distracting', '8217', '12', 'Slave', '8217', 'film', 'had', 'same', 'issues', 'Couple', 'real', 'pacing', 'problem', '8216', 'Out', 'Furnace', '8217', 'nearly', 'off', 'fuel', 'not', 'even', 'halfway', 'story', 'compelling', 'sort', 'film', 'feels', 'extremely', 'bogged', 'down', 'real', 'storytelling', 'problem', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'be', 'centered', 'building', 'up', 'specific', 'crux', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'film', '8217', 's', 'advertising', 'brother', 'missing', 'other', 'brother', 'mad', 'process', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'swift', 'passage', 'time.I', 'need', 'take', 'breath', 'elaborate.The', 'film', 'working', 'man', 'Russell', 'plugging', 'along', 'life', 'hard', 'job', 'sick', 'father', 'wayward', 'brother', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'make', 'everything', 'manageable', 'brother', 'Rodney', 'gambling', 'problem', 'too', 'much', 'Russell', '8217', 'standup', 'reputation', 'brother', 'too', 'much', 'consequence', 'Then', 'Russell', 'drunk', 'reckless', 'decision', 'years', 'prison', 'years', 'pass', 'few', 'minutes', 'brother', 'war', 'father', 'dies', 'girlfriend', 'cop', 'Then', 'Russell', 'free', 'man', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'faltered', 'life', 'ex-girlfriend', 'now', 'pregnant', 'brother', 'back', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'memories', 'street', 'fighting', 'pay', 'off', 'gambling', 'debts.Then', 'stuff', 'happens', 'Russell', 'search', 'brother', 'backwoods', 'literal', 'gangster', 'named', 'Harlan', 'DeGroat.My', 'issue', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'concerned', 'getting', 'final', 'half', 'search', 'Rodney', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'ripe', 'actual', 'character', 'development', 'feels', 'rushed', 'underwritten', 'feels', 'cluttered', 'lazy', 'way', 'throw', 'bunch', 'characters', 'situations', 'ever', 'really', 'developing', 'anything', 'point', 'where', 'feels', 'unnecessary', 'actors', 'are', 'horribly', 'underused', 'especially', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'tonal', 'shift', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'film', '8217', 'second', 'half', 'make', 'first', 'half', 'feel', 'different', 'movie.The', 'first', 'half', 'also', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'being', 'poorly', 'filmed.But', 'pacing', 'issues', 'storytelling', 'problems', 'tonal', 'uncertainty', 'film', 'really', 'respectable', 'cast', 'film', 'best', 'reel', 'Affleck', 'easily', 'standout', 'full', 'ferocity', 'aspect', 'character', 'so', 'compelling', 'honestly', 'wish', 'entire', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'character', 'ending', 'right', 'middle', 'where', '8216', 'missing', '8217', 'was', 'thought', 'whole', 'time', '8217', 'Bale', 'bad', 'here', '8217', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'Russell', 'easily', 'least', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'Harrelson', 'ruthless', 'scenery', 'brilliantly', 'softer', 'shades', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', '8217', 's', 'performances', 'really', 'help', 'make', 'ensemble', 'sing.I', 'just', 'really', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'film.It', '8217', 'beautiful', 'look', 'lighting', 'so', 'much', 'Scott', 'Cooper', '8217', 's', 'script', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'underdeveloped', 'misguided', 'wind', 'sail', 'film', 'just', 'impact', 'time', '8217', '8217', 'completely', 'forgotten']",Out of the Furnace
1658400,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00DL47YY2,Anthony L.,"[108, 118]","Dark, gritty, and saturated with rust, dust, and smog, Out of the Furnace is both a compelling ode to the people of the Rust Belt, bravely persevering through urban decay and rising crime...and a rather predictable thriller elevated by stunning work from Scott Cooper's amazing cast.Main starChristian Balecontinues to enthrall and impress, and he portrays blue collar worker Russell Baze with a gaunt, world-weary pride.Casey Affleckfurthers his streak of edgy, excellent roles with Iraqi War-vet Rodney Baze, which might just be his best yet.Woody Harrelson's Appalachia crime boss is unpredictable and repulsive, with the size and strength to go head-to-head with Bale. Rounding out the terrific cast is a riveting Willem Dafoe, a sturdy Forrest Whitaker, and an underused Zoe Saldana. As I said before, it is thanks to Cooper's winning cast that his movie succeeds as it does.Technically, the movie is excellent. The cinematography is saturated and grey almost to the point of post-apocalyptic-wasteland, but often strangely beautiful. However, if FURNACE has a fault, it would be that it is too focused on being gritty and grim to give any real insight into the people of the Rust Belt.Continuing with cons, the thriller aspect of the film...is sadly, rather predictable. The plot is hardly original, with everything happening in exactly the way the average moviegoer forsees it to happen. This predictability hampers the film and reduces suspense. FURNACE also continues the The Mentalist school of old-men-getting-shot-and-running-for miles reasoning.But heck, enough with the cons. In conclusion, Scott Cooper's OUT OF THE FURNACE is a mostly engrossing drama with tremendous acting, but with a lackluster plot. Standouts go to Woody Harrelson's scenery-chewing performance, and Casey Affleck, whose haunting performance was memorable and heartbreaking. The screenplay may need tweaking, but this film should get out of the furnace, and into your DVD player. 4/5 Stars.P.S. If this review was helpful to you, please give it a like!

1658402,AJRZ98VIOES0U,B00DL47YY2,Argyle Ronin,"[2, 2]","Out of the Furnace is a very convincing look into the blue-collar, low-income life of a small Pennsylvania town where a local steel mill provides the area's premiere source of employment. Christan Bale, Corey Affleck, Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, and Woody Harrelson star as the ensemble cast.Russell Baze (Christian Bale) is a quiet, soft-spoken steel mill laborer who leads a simple life. Russell looks out for his Army Vet brother, Rodney Baze (Casey Affleck), who supports himself through underground, no-holds-barred fighting matches. Things go sour after Rodney fails to payoff his fight promoter, John Petty (Willem Dafoe). Russell meets with John in his office. The pair share a couple of drinks and Russell pays off his younger brother's debt. On the way home a sedan backs out of a driveway and is broadsided by Russell's truck. Russell kills both passengers, one being a little boy. He is sentenced to prison for vehicular manslaughter.The film doesn't go into much detail as to what occurs behind bars. Russell catches an obligatory beat-down after being accosted by another inmate. Rodney pays his raccoon-eyed, jailbird brother a visit, and informs him that their old-man has passed away. Just when things can't get any worse, Russell's girl leaves him for his hometown's sheriff (Forest Whitaker). A scene shows Russell getting inked up to commemorate his sorrows. He resumes his job at the steel mill upon release.Rodney's life as a prize fighter takes a nasty turn when he arranges a fight with Harlan DeGroat's (Woody Harrelson) circuit, a ruthless drug dealer based out of New Jersey. The cash prize is meant to settle a debt between Rodney and Petty, who happens to owe DeGroat a large sum of money. In turn, DeGroat offers Petty and his fighter ring time with a caveat: take a dive and all debts are settled. Rodney swallows his pride and is forced into the agreement. His disappearance is soon to follow.From here, the movie gets violent. Russell takes his brother's disappearance into his own hands, and goes out in search of his missing sibling. Russell's single-minded mission to find his brother is amplified by the rising tension of being an ex-con who lost the love of his life. The movie comes to a grueling climax where Russell must choose between freedom or revenge. What will he decide? Find out for yourself!Every actor does a great job with their performance for the most part. Bale and Affleck are brilliant as the Baze brothers. Dafoe shines in a role almost as colorful as transvestite agent Paul Smecker in ""Boondock Saints."" Harrelson is decent, though his recent string of films have him typecasted as a cardboard villain. Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) was contracted to compose the movie's theme song, ""Out of the Furnace,"" a haunting track that plays during the end credits. The overall film provides a very realistic glimpse into the setting and characters it portrays, and should have received much higher ratings from critics and audiences alike.",4,Most Underrated Movie of 2013,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,2988,"['Furnace', 'very', 'convincing', 'look', 'blue-collar', 'low-income', 'life', 'small', 'Pennsylvania', 'town', 'where', 'local', 'steel', 'mill', 'area', 'premiere', 'source', 'employment', 'Christan', 'Bale', 'Corey', 'Affleck', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'star', 'ensemble', 'cast.Russell', 'Baze', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'quiet', 'soft-spoken', 'steel', 'mill', 'laborer', 'who', 'simple', 'life', 'Russell', 'out', 'Army', 'Vet', 'brother', 'Rodney', 'Baze', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'who', 'underground', 'no-holds-barred', 'fighting', 'matches', 'Things', 'go', 'sour', 'Rodney', 'payoff', 'fight', 'promoter', 'John', 'Petty', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Russell', 'John', 'office', 'pair', 'share', 'couple', 'drinks', 'Russell', 'younger', 'brother', 'debt', 'way', 'home', 'sedan', 'driveway', 'broadsided', 'Russell', 'truck', 'Russell', 'passengers', 'one', 'being', 'little', 'boy', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'vehicular', 'manslaughter.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'detail', 'what', 'bars', 'Russell', 'obligatory', 'beat-down', 'being', 'accosted', 'inmate', 'Rodney', 'raccoon-eyed', 'jailbird', 'brother', 'visit', 'old-man', 'passed', 'away', 'Just', 'when', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'Russell', 'girl', 'hometown', 'sheriff', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'scene', 'Russell', 'getting', 'inked', 'up', 'commemorate', 'sorrows', 'job', 'steel', 'mill', 'release.Rodney', 'life', 'prize', 'fighter', 'nasty', 'turn', 'when', 'fight', 'Harlan', 'DeGroat', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'circuit', 'ruthless', 'drug', 'dealer', 'based', 'New', 'Jersey', 'cash', 'prize', 'meant', 'settle', 'debt', 'Rodney', 'Petty', 'who', 'owe', 'DeGroat', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'turn', 'DeGroat', 'Petty', 'fighter', 'ring', 'time', 'caveat', 'take', 'dive', 'debts', 'are', 'settled', 'Rodney', 'pride', 'forced', 'agreement', 'disappearance', 'soon', 'follow.From', 'here', 'movie', 'violent', 'Russell', 'brother', 'disappearance', 'own', 'hands', 'out', 'search', 'missing', 'sibling', 'Russell', 'single-minded', 'mission', 'find', 'brother', 'amplified', 'rising', 'tension', 'being', 'ex-con', 'who', 'lost', 'love', 'life', 'movie', 'grueling', 'climax', 'where', 'Russell', 'must', 'choose', 'freedom', 'revenge', 'What', 'will', 'decide', 'Find', 'out', 'actor', 'great', 'job', 'performance', 'most', 'part', 'Bale', 'Affleck', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Baze', 'brothers', 'Dafoe', 'shines', 'role', 'almost', 'as', 'colorful', 'transvestite', 'agent', 'Paul', 'Smecker', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'Harrelson', 'decent', 'recent', 'string', 'films', 'have', 'typecasted', 'cardboard', 'villain', 'Eddie', 'Vedder', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'was', 'contracted', 'compose', 'movie', 'theme', 'song', 'Furnace', 'haunting', 'track', 'end', 'credits', 'overall', 'film', 'very', 'realistic', 'glimpse', 'setting', 'characters', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'much', 'higher', 'ratings', 'critics', 'audiences', 'alike']",Out of the Furnace

Dafoe plays as good a role as I've seen him in for a long while.  Zaldana is unremarkable but no doubt was a good move relative to Bale.  I've long felt the younger Affleck a better or more compelling than his elder brother.  Harrelson seems mostly type cast into these type cast in these tough guy/bad guy image.

1658425,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00DL47YY2,DanD,"[4, 5]","Scott Cooper's moody, atmospheric followup to his Oscar-winning CRAZY HEART is a dark, winding journey through the torn soul of two brothers.  The film stars Christian Bale as working man Russell Baze, struggling to care for his ailing father and P.T.S.D.-afflicted brother Rodney (Casey Affleck).  After a fatal drunk driving accident, Russell finds himself doing time, during which Rodney's gambling addiction leads him to illegal bare-knuckle fighting.  Russell gets out, but it isn't long before Rodney goes missing, and Russell finds himself pursuing the man most likely responsible: local crime kingpin Harlan DeGroat (a terrifyingly brutal Woody Harrelson).At first glimpse, OUT OF THE FURNACE seems to be an actor's piece.  Bale delivers, as usual; his performance is haunting, lingering with you after the credits role.  The same goes for Casey Affleck.  The rest of the supporting cast rounds out well, with Willem Defoe, Sam Shepard, and Forest Whitaker fleshing out their minor characters.  Zoe Saldana has a couple of great scenes, but her role is minimal at best, serving more to give Russell something to mourn from his prior life. (Her and Bale do share a tremendous scene after Russell's release from prison, making you wish Saldana has more screen time).  Among the supporting cast, it's Harrelson who shines; he turns DeGroat into a truly menacing threat.  The opening scene along leaves the spine tingling, and from there, Harrelson hulks his way through his scenes, chewing dialogue and spitting it out like tobacco.  His and Bale's final scene together, while mostly wordless, shows what two great actors can do when left to their own devices.However, dig beneath the surface, and you'll find that there's a lot more than just expert casting here.  The script, by Cooper and Brad Ingelsby, is rich, deep, and thoughtful.  FURNACE is beautifully shot, and wholly unrelenting.  It's slow going at points, but this isn't wasted time; the slower scenes build either character or tension, until events explode with surprising brutality.  OUT OF THE FURNACE is a small, intimate film, but it has a lot to say, and a lot to offer.  A worthy follow-up to the tamer CRAZY HEART, and hopefully a promise of brilliant things to come from director Scott Cooper.",5,"""Church ain't over until the snakes are back in the bag.""",1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,2271,"['Scott', 'Cooper', 'moody', 'atmospheric', 'followup', 'Oscar-winning', 'CRAZY', 'HEART', 'dark', 'winding', 'journey', 'torn', 'soul', 'two', 'brothers', 'film', 'stars', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'working', 'man', 'Russell', 'Baze', 'struggling', 'care', 'ailing', 'father', 'P.T.S.D.-afflicted', 'brother', 'Rodney', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'fatal', 'drunk', 'driving', 'accident', 'Russell', 'doing', 'time', 'Rodney', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'illegal', 'bare-knuckle', 'fighting', 'Russell', 'out', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Rodney', 'missing', 'Russell', 'pursuing', 'man', 'most', 'likely', 'responsible', 'local', 'crime', 'kingpin', 'Harlan', 'DeGroat', 'terrifyingly', 'brutal', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', '.At', 'first', 'glimpse', 'OUT', 'THE', 'FURNACE', 'be', 'actor', 'piece', 'Bale', 'delivers', 'usual', 'performance', 'haunting', 'lingering', 'credits', 'role', 'same', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'out', 'well', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'fleshing', 'out', 'minor', 'characters', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'couple', 'great', 'scenes', 'role', 'minimal', 'best', 'serving', 'more', 'give', 'Russell', 'something', 'mourn', 'prior', 'life', 'Bale', 'do', 'share', 'tremendous', 'scene', 'Russell', 'release', 'prison', 'making', 'wish', 'Saldana', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Harrelson', 'who', 'DeGroat', 'truly', 'menacing', 'threat', 'opening', 'scene', 'spine', 'tingling', 'there', 'Harrelson', 'hulks', 'way', 'scenes', 'chewing', 'dialogue', 'spitting', 'tobacco', 'Bale', 'final', 'scene', 'together', 'mostly', 'wordless', 'what', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'left', 'own', 'devices.However', 'dig', 'surface', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'expert', 'casting', 'here', 'script', 'Cooper', 'Brad', 'Ingelsby', 'rich', 'deep', 'thoughtful', 'FURNACE', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'wholly', 'unrelenting', 'slow', 'going', 'points', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'time', 'slower', 'scenes', 'build', 'character', 'tension', 'events', 'explode', 'surprising', 'brutality', 'OUT', 'THE', 'FURNACE', 'small', 'intimate', 'film', 'lot', 'say', 'lot', 'offer', 'worthy', 'follow-up', 'tamer', 'CRAZY', 'HEART', 'hopefully', 'promise', 'brilliant', 'things', 'come', 'director', 'Scott', 'Cooper']",Out of the Furnace
1658426,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00DL47YY2,Darren,"[0, 0]","After watching &#34;American Hustle&#34; and being sort of &#34;meh&#34; about it, I saw that this movie, which I'd never heard of, was &#34;recommended&#34; by Amazon, and, since Christian Bale was basically the only thing in &#34;Hustle&#34; that made that move tolerable, I thought I'd give this one a go.  I'm so glad I did.  It's probably a 4-star movie, but all the griping about it being &#34;slow&#34; (whatever that means -- is everyone jacked up on crank or something? get a grip, sheesh!) has pushed me to give it a 5-star rating.  Maybe the cover art has led bored and evidently twitchy reviewers to assume it's about Bale blasting off shotguns every 30 seconds.  If you've not seen it yet, allow me to let you down early: no, it's not about that.Rather, it's about the serious trouble we're in as a nation, as told through a tried-and-true revenge plot that would suit any Western.  Director Scott Cooper has a lot of things on his mind: the way in which our country discards veterans that volunteered to serve in our fraudulent little wars; the way in which our country discards former boom-towns in the Rust Belt (here, it's Braddock, Pennsylvania); the way in which our country discards whole regions of the land, like Appalachia, if Walmarts can't easily be built there.  I for one appreciate Cooper's ambition, first of all, and I appreciate his skill in weaving these &#34;problem areas&#34; together into a pretty seamless narrative.  The Appalachia thing I found to be most interesting.  The movie's revenge plot centers around whether or not Braddock's constable, Forest Whitaker, is willing or even able to penetrate the hills and apprehend Woody Harrelson for murdering Christian Bale's brother, Casey Affleck.  It's a real issue.  That land is so walled off, so hard to traverse once inside, and its inhabitants so foreign to the ways of the rest of the country, that we can only sympathize with Whitaker's passivity.  Appalachia was inhabited (I hesitate to say &#34;settled&#34;) in the 18th century by people on the run from the law, mostly, and very little has changed in there from that time to this.  Speaking for the Kentucky part of it, which I know well, I can tell you that if you're expecting the usual &#34;Southern hospitality&#34; you won't find it there.  The first question they ask is, &#34;Who's boy are you?&#34; while giving you a gimlet eye.  When small airplanes crash in the hills they're not found for weeks.  Appalachia is virtually a sovereign nation amid the hybrid-driving, Pinkberry-licking swirl of the rest of the country, and Whitaker acts accordingly -- that is to say, he doesn't act.  And thus Bale is obliged to take matters into his own hands.Cooper likes to surprise us.  He deliberately creates the most cliched of narratives and then upends the structure with moments that you won't find in other such movies or in most movies, really.  He has a fine eye for the unique detail, the weird detail, the rancid detail.  Consider the opening scene.  At a drive-in theater, Harrelson demands the hot dog that his girlfriend is about to eat.  (She had sort of laughed at him a moment earlier, so you know she's in trouble.)  He gently tosses the food out of his car window and then proceeds to take a cigar and shove it down her throat before finally slamming her head against the dashboard.  Now, in a regular movie, Harrelson just hits her.  But Cooper wants to make sure that he has our attention.  There's a scene on a bridge between Bale and former love interest Zoe Saldana that has got a lot of attention, and deservedly so.  The scene could've plodded down the usual paths; instead, the script and the actors give us a deeply touching exchange that's bound to become a classic clip.  In describing his new romantic relationship with Saldana, Whitaker tells Bale, &#34;There's not a lot of fire.  But we have something good, you know?  Are you and me gonna be OK?&#34; -- who says stuff like this in the movies?  It's great.  Men also don't kiss their fathers -- dying or otherwise -- in the movies, but Bale does so here.  It's the little things like this that make this movie pretty great.Despite being almost overloaded with a well-known cast, Christian Bale still dominates the proceedings with another superbly controlled performance.  As I said in my review of &#34;American Hustle&#34;, Bale is starting to attain that highest level of the actor's art, which is delivering the desired effects with as little histrionics as possible.  Earlier in his career, he impressed us with his flashiness; now he stuns us with his silences.  I'm starting to think that he is the most compelling male actor in the movies today, and he's only 40 years old.  We really ought to forgive him for yelling at that DP: with performances as good as what he delivers in this movie, he can yell at whomever he likes, as far as I'm concerned.",5,2013's sleeper,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,4890,"['watching', '34', 'American', 'Hustle', '34', 'being', 'sort', '34', 'meh', '34', 'saw', 'movie', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'was', '34', 'recommended', '34', 'Amazon', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'basically', 'only', 'thing', '34', 'Hustle', '34', 'made', 'move', 'tolerable', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'one', 'go', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'probably', '4-star', 'movie', 'griping', 'being', '34', 'slow', '34', 'everyone', 'jacked', 'up', 'crank', 'something', 'get', 'grip', 'sheesh', 'pushed', 'give', '5-star', 'rating', 'Maybe', 'cover', 'art', 'led', 'bored', 'evidently', 'twitchy', 'reviewers', 'assume', 'Bale', 'blasting', 'off', 'shotguns', '30', 'seconds', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'allow', 'let', 'down', 'early', 'not', 'that.Rather', 'serious', 'trouble', ""'re"", 'nation', 'told', 'tried-and-true', 'revenge', 'plot', 'would', 'suit', 'Western', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Cooper', 'lot', 'things', 'mind', 'way', 'country', 'discards', 'veterans', 'volunteered', 'serve', 'fraudulent', 'little', 'wars', 'way', 'country', 'discards', 'former', 'boom-towns', 'Rust', 'Belt', 'here', 'Braddock', 'Pennsylvania', 'way', 'country', 'discards', 'whole', 'regions', 'land', 'Appalachia', 'Walmarts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'easily', 'be', 'built', 'there', 'one', 'appreciate', 'Cooper', 'ambition', 'first', 'appreciate', 'skill', 'weaving', '34', 'problem', 'areas', '34', 'together', 'pretty', 'seamless', 'narrative', 'Appalachia', 'thing', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'movie', 'revenge', 'plot', 'centers', 'not', 'Braddock', 'constable', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'willing', 'even', 'able', 'penetrate', 'hills', 'apprehend', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'murdering', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'brother', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'real', 'issue', 'land', 'so', 'walled', 'off', 'so', 'hard', 'traverse', 'once', 'inside', 'inhabitants', 'so', 'foreign', 'ways', 'rest', 'country', 'can', 'only', 'sympathize', 'Whitaker', 'passivity', 'Appalachia', 'was', 'inhabited', 'hesitate', 'say', '34', 'settled', '34', '18th', 'century', 'people', 'run', 'law', 'mostly', 'very', 'little', 'changed', 'there', 'time', 'Speaking', 'Kentucky', 'part', 'know', 'well', 'can', 'tell', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'usual', '34', 'Southern', 'hospitality', '34', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'there', 'first', 'question', 'ask', '34', 'Who', 'boy', 'are', '34', 'giving', 'gimlet', 'eye', 'When', 'small', 'airplanes', 'crash', 'hills', ""'re"", 'not', 'found', 'weeks', 'Appalachia', 'virtually', 'sovereign', 'nation', 'hybrid-driving', 'Pinkberry-licking', 'swirl', 'rest', 'country', 'Whitaker', 'accordingly', 'say', ""n't"", 'act', 'thus', 'Bale', 'obliged', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands.Cooper', 'likes', 'surprise', 'deliberately', 'most', 'cliched', 'narratives', 'then', 'structure', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'other', 'such', 'movies', 'most', 'movies', 'really', 'fine', 'eye', 'unique', 'detail', 'weird', 'detail', 'rancid', 'detail', 'Consider', 'opening', 'scene', 'drive-in', 'theater', 'Harrelson', 'hot', 'dog', 'girlfriend', 'eat', 'had', 'sort', 'laughed', 'moment', 'earlier', 'know', 'trouble', 'gently', 'food', 'car', 'window', 'then', 'proceeds', 'take', 'cigar', 'shove', 'down', 'throat', 'finally', 'slamming', 'head', 'dashboard', 'Now', 'regular', 'movie', 'Harrelson', 'just', 'Cooper', 'make', 'sure', 'attention', 'scene', 'bridge', 'Bale', 'former', 'love', 'interest', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'got', 'lot', 'attention', 'deservedly', 'so', 'scene', 'could', ""'ve"", 'plodded', 'down', 'usual', 'paths', 'instead', 'script', 'actors', 'give', 'deeply', 'touching', 'exchange', 'bound', 'become', 'classic', 'clip', 'describing', 'new', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Saldana', 'Whitaker', 'Bale', '34', 'not', 'lot', 'fire', 'have', 'something', 'good', 'know', 'Are', 'gon', 'be', 'OK', '34', 'who', 'stuff', 'movies', 'great', 'Men', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'kiss', 'fathers', 'dying', 'otherwise', 'movies', 'Bale', 'so', 'here', 'little', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'pretty', 'great.Despite', 'being', 'almost', 'overloaded', 'well-known', 'cast', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'still', 'proceedings', 'superbly', 'controlled', 'performance', 'said', 'review', '34', 'American', 'Hustle', '34', 'Bale', 'starting', 'attain', 'highest', 'level', 'actor', 'art', 'delivering', 'desired', 'effects', 'as', 'little', 'histrionics', 'possible', 'Earlier', 'career', 'impressed', 'flashiness', 'now', 'silences', ""'m"", 'starting', 'think', 'most', 'compelling', 'male', 'actor', 'movies', 'today', 'only', '40', 'years', 'old', 'really', 'ought', 'forgive', 'yelling', 'DP', 'performances', 'as', 'good', 'what', 'movie', 'can', 'yell', 'whomever', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned']",Out of the Furnace

Essential information is absent where it should be focal in order to make this story more poignant.Russell Baze (Christian Bale) and his younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) live in the economically-depressed Rust Belt (some of the buildings indicate Reading, PA), and have always dreamed of escaping and finding better lives. Their father (dying) and uncle Red (Sam Shepard) live at the poverty level, Russell's only happiness is his relationship with Lena (Zoe Saldana). Rodney is serving separate deployments to Iraq and his mind is being irreversibly damaged by the war. An auto accident in which Russell (who has been drinking) includes a fatality and lands Russell in prison, unable to care for his dying father, losing Lena, and unable to support Rodney's debts. Rodney, unable to tolerate working in the mills associates with the strange John Petty (Willem Dafoe) who arranges and fixes fights. Desperate for income Rodney agrees to become involved with one of the most violent and ruthless crime rings in the Northeast, a crime ring run buy the grossly disgusting and malevolent Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) - a mistake that will cost him everything. Once released, Russell must choose between his own freedom, or risk it all to seek justice for his brother.The cast is uniformly excellent - Bale, Affleck, Harrelson, Shepard, Dafoe, Saldana, and Forest Whitaker as the confused sheriff. The story is consistently dark in message and in cinematography, though the compassion and commitment within family is palpable. It offers some fine comparisons between PTSD effects from the constant misuse of soldiers in the Middle East and the chronic fatigue of poverty and crime in the depressed sector of America that used to be the pot of gold for industry. It is concerned with revenge that seems to have trouble finding a focus - so much of the world is out of focus for these tragic characters. This is a raw look at today. Were it not for a brilliant cast this film would not work at all. It pleads to be re-edited. Grady Harp, March 14",4,'Working for a living?

Christian Bale is always great at portraying different types of characters - this role was one type I don't recall seeing - not just where he's from but the emotion evoked by his character was new to me. Woody Harrelson has played the mean, badass before but he played this one differently, and very intense- crazed and mean like never before. I own most of these two actors' films, so I see a difference which could be attributed to the director even though these two are great at portraying characters of all types. Casey Affleck is even slightly different in his acting this time. Willem Dafoe's part was short, as was Sam Sheperd's and Forrest Whittaker's but their roles were played well, too. For a movie that encompasses many situations done on film before, this movie put them into one story that is ..&#34;moving&#34; , for lack of a better word to describe how I was affected and isn't as strong an adjective as I want to use. I think the director, who's name unfortunately escapes me at the moment - will be one who's name I will not forget should he continue directing. I believe this was his first or second effort (I think he acted before); an excellent, well done effort at that.

It was released in early December which suggest it might have had some Oscar ambitions, but disappeared from the theaters before I had a chance to find it, and so I watched it online instead.Director Scott Cooper's first movie Crazy Heart won two Oscars;one for Jeff Bridges as a country singer grappling with alcoholic demons, and one for T Bone Burnett for the music.Casey Affleck has demonstrated like his brother an ability not only to act but to wear the multiple hats of screen writer and director. Interestingly like Ben for Goodwill Hunting he wrote a screenplay with Matt Damon for a movie in which they both starred called Gerry, apparently based on a true life case of murder involving two friends lost in the desert. Interestingly, someone I know was friends of the victim, and he was very miffed at how the case turned out.He starred in the acclaimed Gone Baby Gone written and directed by Ben Affleck, and I found his performance in the disturbing movie The Killer Inside Me where he plays a mild mannered small town sheriff, and a serial killer to be quite compelling. A scene with a prostitute played by Jessica Alba many found too disturbingly real for a murder movie.OOTF also stars Academy Award winners Forest Whitaker and Christian Bale, and a particularly menacing and realistic killer played by Woody Harrelson, and Willem Dafoe as a local fixer. Zoe Saldana plays the girlfriend.Out of the Furnace relates the story of two brothers Russell (Bale) and Rodney Baze (Affleck) who live in a small town whose main industry is the mill, and where abides a shadowy world of drugs and bare knuckle fighting. The relationship of the two brothers is well developed, and one can sense a foreboding in the seeming ordinariness of their lives, for Rodney Baze is not at ease in the town and wants something more than a mundane job at the mill, the two options being bare knuckle fighting or joining the military, and the older more responsible brother (Bale) has to keep an eye on his younger brother, particularly as he does not adjust to the corrupt realities of diving in the underworld.Although we can see the recklessness of the younger brother being a tragic flaw, it is the older brother who ends up in jail. For a while it seems as if tragedy is frustrated as the younger brother goes off to war, but wars don't last forever, and neither do military careers, and Rodney finds himself once again at the burning end of his desire for something more, this time dogged by the horror of his war experiences.If you're like me there is some symbolism which may put you in mind of The Deer Hunter.Before long our characters paths will cross once again with the antagonist, and there are enough warnings about the lethal potential of this world for young Rodney to take heed, and we sense his lack of ability to control himself in the heat of a fight may have lethal consequences.By the way we do come to love Rodney even if he is reckless, because we know he is a good guy at heart.When someone is murdered and Rodney disappears, Russell an accomplished marksman and hunter has dilemmas. Should he leave it to law enforcement, follow his girlfriends advice and let it go, or take matters into his own hands against a dangerous individual and the leader of a gang who places no value on human life above his own ego and impulse.Revenge or no revenge, that is the dilemma.Woody Harrelson has made a career out of playing tough uncompromising manly guys. There can be no denying his bad boy credentials. But the biggest surprise in this movie is the brilliant acting performance of Casey Affleck, probably his best performance to date. I would not have bought him as a tough military guy or a street fighter before seeing this movie as it seems so out of character for him, but he succeeds in bringing intensity and nuance to this character, essentially he becomes the heart and soul of this movie, shining out among very well established actors who have won the greatest awards.His performance is so good I think it does deserve an Academy Award Award nomination, and I would be extremely gratified if it did, but I suspect this movie in general, though not the best movie of the year by a long shot, might slip entirely through the cracks, and Affleck's performance with it.If the premise of this movie intrigues you I would recommend you go for it. I think most people will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.",4,Sometimes your battle picks you,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,4590,"['must', 'admit', 'found', 'trailer', 'Out', 'Furnace', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'intriguing', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', '2012', 'filled', 'burning', 'curiosity', 'see', 'was', 'released', 'early', 'December', 'suggest', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'Oscar', 'ambitions', 'disappeared', 'theaters', 'had', 'chance', 'find', 'so', 'watched', 'online', 'instead.Director', 'Scott', 'Cooper', 'first', 'movie', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'won', 'two', 'Oscars', 'one', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'country', 'singer', 'grappling', 'alcoholic', 'demons', 'one', 'T', 'Bone', 'Burnett', 'music.Casey', 'Affleck', 'demonstrated', 'brother', 'ability', 'not', 'only', 'act', 'wear', 'multiple', 'hats', 'screen', 'writer', 'director', 'Interestingly', 'Ben', 'Goodwill', 'Hunting', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'movie', 'starred', 'called', 'Gerry', 'apparently', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'case', 'murder', 'involving', 'two', 'friends', 'lost', 'desert', 'Interestingly', 'someone', 'know', 'was', 'friends', 'victim', 'was', 'very', 'miffed', 'how', 'case', 'turned', 'out.He', 'starred', 'acclaimed', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'written', 'directed', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'found', 'performance', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'Killer', 'Inside', 'Me', 'where', 'mild', 'mannered', 'small', 'town', 'sheriff', 'serial', 'killer', 'be', 'quite', 'compelling', 'scene', 'prostitute', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'many', 'found', 'too', 'disturbingly', 'real', 'murder', 'movie.OOTF', 'also', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'particularly', 'menacing', 'realistic', 'killer', 'played', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'local', 'fixer', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'girlfriend.Out', 'Furnace', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'Russell', 'Bale', 'Rodney', 'Baze', 'Affleck', 'who', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'main', 'industry', 'mill', 'where', 'shadowy', 'world', 'drugs', 'bare', 'knuckle', 'fighting', 'relationship', 'two', 'brothers', 'well', 'developed', 'one', 'can', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'seeming', 'ordinariness', 'lives', 'Rodney', 'Baze', 'not', 'ease', 'town', 'something', 'more', 'mundane', 'job', 'mill', 'two', 'options', 'being', 'bare', 'knuckle', 'fighting', 'joining', 'military', 'older', 'more', 'responsible', 'brother', 'Bale', 'keep', 'eye', 'younger', 'brother', 'particularly', 'not', 'adjust', 'corrupt', 'realities', 'diving', 'underworld.Although', 'can', 'see', 'recklessness', 'younger', 'brother', 'being', 'tragic', 'flaw', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'up', 'jail', 'while', 'tragedy', 'frustrated', 'younger', 'brother', 'war', 'wars', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'forever', 'neither', 'do', 'military', 'careers', 'Rodney', 'once', 'again', 'burning', 'end', 'desire', 'something', 'more', 'time', 'dogged', 'horror', 'war', 'experiences.If', ""'re"", 'symbolism', 'may', 'put', 'mind', 'Deer', 'Hunter.Before', 'long', 'characters', 'paths', 'will', 'cross', 'once', 'again', 'antagonist', 'are', 'enough', 'warnings', 'lethal', 'potential', 'world', 'young', 'Rodney', 'take', 'heed', 'sense', 'lack', 'ability', 'control', 'heat', 'fight', 'may', 'have', 'lethal', 'consequences.By', 'way', 'do', 'come', 'love', 'Rodney', 'even', 'reckless', 'know', 'good', 'guy', 'heart.When', 'someone', 'murdered', 'Rodney', 'disappears', 'Russell', 'accomplished', 'marksman', 'hunter', 'dilemmas', 'Should', 'leave', 'law', 'enforcement', 'follow', 'girlfriends', 'advice', 'let', 'go', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'dangerous', 'individual', 'leader', 'gang', 'who', 'value', 'human', 'life', 'own', 'ego', 'impulse.Revenge', 'revenge', 'dilemma.Woody', 'Harrelson', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'tough', 'uncompromising', 'manly', 'guys', 'can', 'be', 'denying', 'bad', 'boy', 'credentials', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'performance', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bought', 'tough', 'military', 'guy', 'street', 'fighter', 'seeing', 'movie', 'so', 'character', 'bringing', 'intensity', 'nuance', 'character', 'essentially', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'shining', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'established', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'won', 'greatest', 'awards.His', 'performance', 'so', 'good', 'think', 'deserve', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Award', 'nomination', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'gratified', 'did', 'suspect', 'movie', 'general', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'long', 'shot', 'might', 'slip', 'entirely', 'cracks', 'Affleck', 'performance', 'premise', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'go', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",Out of the Furnace

As the movie opens, we witness a man (played by Woody Harrelson) getting into an argument with his date while they are watching a movie at the drive-in, leading eventually to the pummeling of a bystander who wants to stop the abuse. It makes for almost uncomfortable watching but it certainly established the Woody Harrelson character (we later learn his name is Curtis DeGroat) as one of the more brutal, mean and outright sadistic characters on the big screen in a long time. Meanwhile back to the Baze brothers, Russell causes a car crash, sending him to jail. Rodney is back from another tour of duty in Iraq, and dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder which lead him to get involved with illegal/underground bare-knuckle fights. Then Russell gets released from jail. At this point we are a good 30-35 min, into the movie. To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this is the second movie from director Scott Cooper, after 2009's excellent &#34;Crazy Heart&#34; (the Jeff Bridges vehicle). Here again, Cooper tackles a tough relationship drama, albeit in a very different setting. Second, the parallels between this and &#34;The Deer Hunter&#34; are striking: both are set in a dying steel mill town, both deal with post-war stress (then: Vietnam, now: Iraq), both provide hunting as a possible form of temporary stress relief (down to the one-on-one confrontation between the hunter and the deer). Third, the acting performances in this movie are nothing short of stellar, and this movie features a veritable all-star cast. In addition to the already mentioned Bale, Affleck and Harrelson, there are equally juicy performances from the likes of Sam Shepard (as the old uncle), Zoe Saldana (as the (ex) girlfriend), Forest Whitaker as the police chief, and William Dafoe as a deranged underground ring leader. Fourth, check out the excellent soundtrack from Dickon Hinchliffe, which is available here on Amazon, but which strangely does not include Pear Jam's &#34;Release&#34;, which plays over the closing credits of the movie.Bottom line: &#34;Out of the Furnace&#34; is a heavy and gritty movie, dealing with/exposing an ugly underbelly of society.

Deep down, it's really a character study and examines the lives of people in a Pennsylvanian steel town. The two principal characters are Russell and Rodney Baze (Bale & Affleck, respectively). One is a down-to-earth, unassuming guy just trying to make an honest living, while the other is a former soldier who feels that his country has let him down. One thing the movie does really well is establish the relationships between the characters, and the one between Russell and Rodney rings especially true. However, the choices of one leads the other one down a path that he might have preferred to stay off of. There's also a rather impressive supporting casts, with turns by Willem Dafoe, Forrest Whitaker and Zoe Saldana. However, these supporting characters are never really given their due. But the best performance, aside from Bale and Affleck, is given by Woody Harrelson as a drug-addled, boozing, backwoods and generally malcontent criminal who runs an illegal fight operation (and a crackhouse). Despite his limited screen time, he manages to give a full-bodied performance of someone who just doesn't care about anyone but himself. Very nihilistic, selfish, grimy, dirty, unlikeable, etc. Of all the supporting cast who don't really show up a lot, him not showing up as much makes some sense. It doesn't really take much time to get a sense of who he is as a character. Other positives include some gorgeous cinematography and the direction by Scott Cooper is competent, if unremarkable. Even though the story is a bit predictable, and the ending is somewhat underwhelming, he does manage to get excellent performances from his actors, which is fine for what this movie was trying to be.",3,"My review of ""Out of the Furnace""",1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,1854,"['THE', 'FURNACE', 'well-acted', 'high-caliber', 'cast', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'compelling', 'themes', 'set', 'forth', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Deep', 'down', 'really', 'character', 'study', 'lives', 'people', 'Pennsylvanian', 'steel', 'town', 'two', 'principal', 'characters', 'are', 'Russell', 'Rodney', 'Baze', 'Bale', 'Affleck', 'respectively', 'One', 'down-to-earth', 'unassuming', 'guy', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'honest', 'living', 'other', 'former', 'soldier', 'who', 'country', 'let', 'down', 'One', 'thing', 'movie', 'really', 'well', 'establish', 'relationships', 'characters', 'one', 'Russell', 'Rodney', 'rings', 'especially', 'true', 'However', 'choices', 'one', 'other', 'one', 'path', 'might', 'have', 'preferred', 'stay', 'also', 'rather', 'impressive', 'supporting', 'casts', 'turns', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'However', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'due', 'best', 'performance', 'aside', 'Bale', 'Affleck', 'given', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'drug-addled', 'boozing', 'backwoods', 'generally', 'malcontent', 'criminal', 'who', 'illegal', 'fight', 'operation', 'crackhouse', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'give', 'full-bodied', 'performance', 'someone', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'care', 'anyone', 'Very', 'nihilistic', 'selfish', 'grimy', 'dirty', 'unlikeable', 'etc', 'supporting', 'cast', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'up', 'lot', 'not', 'showing', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'sense', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'much', 'time', 'get', 'sense', 'who', 'character', 'Other', 'positives', 'include', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'direction', 'Scott', 'Cooper', 'competent', 'unremarkable', 'Even', 'story', 'bit', 'predictable', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'underwhelming', 'manage', 'get', 'excellent', 'performances', 'actors', 'fine', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'be']",Out of the Furnace

And yet I for one could not put my finger in just what it is. Perhaps it is no one thing, but a combination of many, all of them interconnected.There is much about the film that is, superficially at least, reminiscent of ""The Deer Hunter [1978]"", with its mix of combat fatigue, world weariness and self-destructive leanings of broken men. It also shares some of the earlier movie's iconic screen moments, which it is hard to believe are coincidental. But the comparison does the film no favours: Christian Bale, good as he is, is no Robert De Niro; the action is so slow-moving as to be glacial and the storyline takes so many sideways hops it is often unclear just what its real message is meant to be.In summary, then, this is not a bad movie, but neither is it a great one.

I thought those were effective. It was the writing and directing that made this less than the stellar movie it could have been. It's disjointed. There is no flow to connect them. You have a love scene, an accident, jail, a break-up (for example) that gives you juice in each one, but they land like separate events. They don't appear to have happened to the same people. You don't get the full impact of these things. This happens for the scenes in one person's life as well as interpersonally, meaning that what happens to one person doesn't particularly show the effect for those around him/her (like apparently the girlfriend really loves Bales yet you never get a sense of why she made the choices she did. That is important. It fleshes out the story and makes you care).Then you have this really jacked up ending. Whitaker is saying something like, &#34;Put the gun down. Don't do it&#34; when Bale is just standing there with a rifle in his hands. He's not aiming or even behaving in a threatening way. He looks pretty calm, cool, and collected. I couldn't tell that he was thinking about killing anybody. He had just shot him twice in the leg and let him run. If anything, I thought the sheriff was saying those things so that he could kill Bales and make it look like Bales was threatening either him or the Harrelson. It just didn't play sincerely.

It is set in a depressed part of America referred to as `the rust belt' by the production team. Christian Bale plays Russell Baze who works at the local steel works like his daddy before him. Younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) just wants out and has joined the army to escape the hum drum existence of small town USA.On his return Russell has landed up in prison for a terrible twist of circumstance. Rodney meanwhile has got involved with the world of underground bare knuckle fighting in order to pay off his debts. Problem is this is a world dominated by the likes of Harlan DeGroat - played by an as ever excellent Woody Harrelson. He is the sort of guy that would give you nightmares and he don't take prisoners. Throw into the mix some very unsavoury characters a small but very good part for Willem Dafoe and a caring cop - Forest Whitaker, and you have what should be a more than satisfying crime thriller.The thing is this should have been excellent - even the music is done by Dickon Hinchliffe (ex of `Tindersticks') and adds excellent mood and pace, but it is still just above pedestrian in places. I think this could be down to the plot which will hold scant few surprises albeit with a few twists along the way. The acting is often from the `mumbling is acting' school, which just makes people hard to understand and some of the on screen antics require a bit too much faith on the part of the viewer.

After seeing Out of the Furnace in theaters I was surprised to find that its ending had stayed with me for a while. I was baffled, really, because I had to ask myself what it was about and there was no easy answer. And that's this movie in a nutshell. It makes you work to get it, but where most films with this &#34;problem&#34; fail in senselessness, Out of the Furnace rewards your extra cognitive workout with something that becomes maybe not enjoyable per se, but relatable. This movie was not made for spectacle, and it was not made to make you feel good: many of these characters are good people who are victims of circumstance and, while justice does come, it is bittersweet.Visually it is ugly, in the sense that Out of the Furnace brings you into a dying industrial town, to dying people who have accepted their fates and intend to walk sleepily into their inevitable demise. It is dusty, rusty, covered in graffiti, and filled with depression. Christian Bale's character, Russell, tries to fix up his home, but all it really amounts to is a coat of paint hiding the age of the place (if you're pickin' up what I'm puttin' down, here).Out of the Furnace is one of those movies that most people will not understand, and they'll probably criticize it (fairly), because its talented cast will likely lure in the unsuspecting.

1658572,AP3B615GM191G,B00DL47YY2,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[4, 6]","Have you ever seen one of those movies where all the pieces are present but it just doesn't gel together like it should? &#34;Out of the Furnace&#34; is exactly that type of film. It SHOULD work, but it doesn't.For a basic plot summary, this movie centers on the events of two brothers. Russell Blaze (Christian Bale) is a factory mill worker representing the American &#34;everyman&#34; trying to survive in an economically depressed area. His job is no prize, to be sure, but it keeps him living. On the other hand, brother Rodney (Casey Affleck), a military veteran home in between deployments, doesn't quite share the views of Russell, not wanting to toil in a mill and turning to the bottle and gambling as a result. When Rodney (an accomplished street- brawler) gets in trouble with Harland DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), leader of the intimidating in-bred Appalachian mountain folk, not even the police will stage a rescue. It is up to Russell to see that his brother is taken care of.There are two primary factors that render this film decidedly average:First, it's themes are far too similar to other Bale films like &#34;The Fighter&#34; and even, albeit to a lesser extent, &#34;The Machinist&#34;. Both are better flicks than this one, so it is tough for this piece to carve out its own place.Secondly, the casting (and directing from Scott Cooper) is so uneven. Bale is not nearly used to his full potential (one has to let him emote more), while other great actors like Forest Whitaker and William Dafoe are given bit roles unbecoming of their on-screen statures.Actually, the crown jewel of the entire film is Harrelson's DeGroat. From the opening scene of the film, it is clear that this is one of the most reviled villain characters to ever be put on screen. He steals every scene he is in.Thus, if you haven't seen any previous dark works like this (or any previous similar Bale roles), this movie might be a little better for you. For the more seasoned viewers, though, this is just &#34;one of those movies&#34; where the pieces don't snap together well enough.

1658573,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B00DL47YY2,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[0, 0]","Out of the Furnace is a raw, heart-felt drama with some harsh twists and satisfying violence.  Not an action flick.  In fact, this film is pretty slow.  In this way--and because of the terrific performances--Out of the Furnace is quite realistic.Be aware that this is not the feel-good movie of the year, nor is it too depressing to watch. It is gritty and a bit dark--like its two PA and NJ settings.  It's a movie about hard people having hard times and clashing with hard criminals.  The end is appropriate and leaves you with some questions and speculations.The only issue I have is that--being familiar with Jersey--I am not sure this movie portrays the impoverished, semi-rural people properly.  I don't remember any hillbilly mountain justice tales coming out of Jersey.  LOL.  But Jersey has a LOT more strange and &#34;country-ish&#34; areas than you might expect.  Pick up a &#34;Weird New Jersey&#34; book or magazine and you will get the idea.Good film, if you have the patience to enjoy slow development, superb performances, and gritty, realistic experiences.",4,Pennsy vs. Jersey: Poor Folk Funkin',1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,1073,"['Furnace', 'raw', 'heart-felt', 'drama', 'harsh', 'twists', 'satisfying', 'violence', 'Not', 'action', 'flick', 'fact', 'film', 'pretty', 'slow', 'way', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Furnace', 'quite', 'realistic.Be', 'aware', 'not', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'year', 'too', 'depressing', 'watch', 'gritty', 'bit', 'dark', 'two', 'PA', 'NJ', 'settings', 'movie', 'hard', 'people', 'having', 'hard', 'times', 'clashing', 'hard', 'criminals', 'end', 'appropriate', 'questions', 'only', 'issue', 'have', 'being', 'familiar', 'Jersey', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'impoverished', 'semi-rural', 'people', 'properly', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'hillbilly', 'mountain', 'justice', 'tales', 'coming', 'Jersey', 'LOL', 'Jersey', 'LOT', 'more', 'strange', '34', 'country-ish', '34', 'areas', 'might', 'expect', 'Pick', 'up', '34', 'Weird', 'New', 'Jersey', '34', 'book', 'magazine', 'will', 'get', 'idea.Good', 'film', 'have', 'patience', 'enjoy', 'slow', 'development', 'superb', 'performances', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'experiences']",Out of the Furnace
1658574,A12LKEM543ILBK,B00DL47YY2,zombie phreak,"[0, 1]","Okay, so the trailers for this  movie make it look friggin' awesome!  It looks like we have two brothers, one who is trying to live a normal life and one who is into underground fighting for profit.  The fighter gets into trouble and the hard working brother has to take the law into his own hands and go and save him.  That's kinda what happens but it's so boring and takes so long that you'll lost interest in it before you get to any action.Plus you really mean to tell me that this cop is actually telling this guy that the police won't go after this group of rednecks because they are too pyscho and violent?  If that's the case, you call in the state troopers or if that doesn't work the, the case is a murder, therefore it'll pop up on the FBI's radar so you could probably call them in to help you.Not to mention that at the end when we FINALLY get some sort of climax, Christian Bale's character has a rifle trained on his brother's killer and the one cop in town is watching while he does this, and just tells him not to do it.  Okay look, if someone is pointing a gun at someone else, I'm pretty sure that a cop has the authorization to shoot that person in order to keep the other person safe.This movie had Casey Affleck, Christian Bale, and Woody Harrelson in it.  But even that cast of talented individuals couldn't save this movie and make it enjoyable.  And frankly after watching it, I'm not surprised that it bombed at the box office.Don't waste your time or your money, don't buy this and don't even rent it for a dollar at the Redbox.
