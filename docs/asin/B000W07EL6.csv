Salama,"[12, 17]","In this terror film, the most inept band of kidnappers in world history abducts the child from hell, an eight year old adopted boy from a very wealthy family in New England, who's in fact the antichrist or something. One by one, the kidnappers will pay for their deed. The film looks like an unauthorized knock off of The Omen, and while mildly entertaining, is hardly a great film. Made with a no name cast (except perhaps for Michael Rooker, who twenty years ago has a cult hit in Henry, Portrait of a serial killer) the good scenery from New England in winter and a good hand in the directing adds a little to this passable movie.

1106124,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B000W07EL6,Don R. Holloway,"[0, 0]","""Whisper"" is a movie about a man (Josh Holloway) who is hired to kidnap a young boy (the adorable Blake Woodruff) and hold him for ransom. The man, Max, and his 'associates' think this plan is straightforward and foolproof. They sure have a lot to learn. This film is definitely not your typical 'formula' Adventure/Horror film. The various plot twists keep the film one step ahead of the viewer. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering what was going to happen next. The young director, Stewart Hendler, does an excellent job with this movie. He has a clear vision of where he wants the story to go. Josh Holloway gives a very strong performance, and young Blake Woodruff plays his character to perfection. (I think this kid has a great future in acting.) If you are hesitant to watch this movie because you think it is just a ripoff of every other horror film you've seen, then you will be missing out on something spectacular.

And then, whaddaya know, suddenly it is suggested to me by Amazon!This movie is great fun and the spoiler in the reviews are going to kill it for you. The fun was all in the discovery of what the deal was with the boy (not going to spoil it, just in case you missed the hundreds of other people's reviews that do- even right in the title). Inconsiderate much?Once again, I am forced to take issue with people's weak thinking/analysis that stops immediately after the first strong association (this movie is a ____ rip off/version/etc.) Uh... the horror genre is full of recycled thematic content. So what? There hasn't been a truly original idea since maybe Shakespeare's era, but I'm sure scholars would be able to  tie those back to Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy and art. Its time to get over this. The issue is not 'is an idea novel?' but 'how is that idea translated into film (or fill in the medium blank)? Does it work? Is it effective?What I recall about this film is that it was a fun ride. I enjoyed ""Sawyer"" (my fave character) on LOST, so I was excited to see JH in something else. I liked his character here as well, and I thought the drama surrounding the kidnapping, the relationship conflict that emerged, generated good tension for most of the ride, and to set up the end. 3/4 of the film is that. The big reveal happens toward the end and that was surely entertaining.  Hell, I think I'll watch this one again. Tho, to be fair to my other 4s, I'd have to say this one is more of a 3.5 on my meter. This one's fun, but its not one I'd necessarily add to my collection. So adjust your expectations.

It looks great and its backdrop of a snow-covered landscape and shadowy old house is a perfect setting as a demon child turns the table on his kidnappers in the worst way possble.Director Stewart Hendler and writer Christopher Borrelli are to be applauded for trying to do something fresh with the ""Demon Child"" genre--and they more than succeed.  The grisly deaths are innovative and chilling.But much of the credit for the triumph of this exercise in terror goes to the outstanding cast who give it their all.  Newcomer Blake Woodruff as the creepy, unnerving child monster deserves top accolades and he's matched all the way by handsome, troubled Josh Holloway as the reluctant villian who somehow makes his character vulnerable and tragic.

The leader of the four is an aging bank robber Sidney (Michael Rooker), a dangerous criminal who spend half of his life in jail and who has blood on his hands. His wingmen, thieves Max (Josh Holloway) and Vince (Joel Edgerton) are younger and less dangerous, but they are also career criminals. Max girlfriend Roxanne (Sarah Wayne Callies) was co-opted to take care of the kidnapped child.Well, as it is signaled on the back cover of the DVD, pretty soon it will become clear, that David is not an ordinary child - and in fact it is not him who is in danger, but the people who abducted him... I will not say more here to avoid spoilers.The scenario is not bad at all and almost of the film makes for a nice watch. The ending could be a little bit better, but it is not half as bad in most of horror films. The one big hole in the plot is the abysmal idiocy of a policeman who drives to a distant and isolated location without any backup and without even signalling where he is going - but I have seen much worse in B-movies (and not only B-movies)...All actors performed well, but it was the young Blake Woodruf (he was 12 at that time) who plays David who really impressed me, because unlike Damian in ""Omen"", David speaks a lot and well. And if this young actor can play something else as well as in this film, well, he has a great future before him... Another strong point in the cast is Sarah Wayne Callies, a very beautiful woman but also clearly a very good actress.I liked this film and I think I will keep the DVD for a rewatch one day.

Some memorable and powerful overhead shots of Maine. One shot was almost a still with only images of cars moving, very affecting.Clever touches throughout in the direction. For example, there is a match cut from three cards on the wall, two of them clubs, to blinds with with clover silhouettes.Very good scoring through much of the film, although the score and the sound design falls off substantially in the last hour, where there is much too much stock foley effects and also stock creepy horror music. But the ""Carol of the Bells"" montage is spectacular, and the Cash ""Ring of Fire"" very apt.Acting is quite good throughout. Plot somewhat marred by the ""lone cop syndrome"" that so many movies rely on, and an ending perhaps a bit long with some cliched expects, but here again, it was really the sound design and the score that marred it.Overall, though, a deft film.As to the DVD, transfer was good quality. Deleted scenes (usually overrated) were not entirely useless here. Some reasonable background on the cop, for example. Making of feature was interesting and frankly surprising in many respects (for instance, that a child stunt double hanging 40-feet above the ground doing acrobatics was used for some of the stunts), although it was missing a description of how they got all those aerial shots (CG? helicopter? some kind of remote dolly?), and not much on the lighting.",5,Underrated but very skillfully made,1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,1502,"['Skillfully', 'made', 'horror', 'flick', 'distinguished', 'genre', 'companions', 'primarily', 'Dean', 'Cundey', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'memorable', 'powerful', 'overhead', 'shots', 'Maine', 'One', 'shot', 'was', 'almost', 'still', 'only', 'images', 'cars', 'moving', 'very', 'affecting.Clever', 'touches', 'direction', 'example', 'match', 'cut', 'three', 'cards', 'wall', 'two', 'clubs', 'blinds', 'clover', 'silhouettes.Very', 'good', 'scoring', 'much', 'film', 'score', 'sound', 'design', 'off', 'substantially', 'last', 'hour', 'where', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'stock', 'foley', 'effects', 'also', 'stock', 'creepy', 'horror', 'music', 'Carol', 'Bells', 'montage', 'spectacular', 'Cash', 'Ring', 'Fire', 'very', 'apt.Acting', 'quite', 'good', 'Plot', 'somewhat', 'marred', 'lone', 'cop', 'syndrome', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'rely', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'long', 'cliched', 'here', 'again', 'was', 'really', 'sound', 'design', 'score', 'marred', 'it.Overall', 'though', 'deft', 'film.As', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'good', 'quality', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'usually', 'overrated', 'were', 'not', 'entirely', 'useless', 'here', 'reasonable', 'background', 'cop', 'example', 'Making', 'feature', 'was', 'interesting', 'frankly', 'surprising', 'many', 'respects', 'instance', 'child', 'stunt', 'double', 'hanging', '40-feet', 'ground', 'doing', 'acrobatics', 'was', 'used', 'stunts', 'was', 'missing', 'description', 'how', 'got', 'aerial', 'shots', 'CG', 'helicopter', 'kind', 'remote', 'dolly', 'not', 'much', 'lighting']",Whisper
