Characters were very annoying and not fun to watch in the slightest!!! F & D crush on each other....kids don't want to see that! V really isn't that smart...FLAW. Shag...couldn't get more annoying and finally Scooby doo is not even the main character in this flick. The title is ""Scooby-Doo"" and not ""The Kids with the Occasional Dog"". My children are Scooby doo EVERYTHING!!!!! They love ALL the Scooby doo chartoons (old and new) and the 2 Hollywood movies too. My boys loved even the old globe trotter, Addams family Scooby doo cartoons. But this one......DO NOT BOTHER!!! My boys were bored and got up to leave a dozen times through this one. Did NOT keep their attention the least bit!!!  They were so excited to see the NEW Scooby doo movie and was a HUGE let down!!!!The fact that I am taking my time to write a review (my first review ever) should let you know just how bad this one is!!!If there was an option for NO stars...............Guess what??",1,New is NOT better!

Though, obviously targeting younger audiences almost exclusively, rather than designed to appeal to us (ahum) aging fans that grew up with the cartoons, it was still fun seeing the characters I loved in my youth, come to life in a new way.  Watching the first two films with my niece and nephew (6 and 8 yrs old) enhanced the experience even more, as they were screaming and giggling like I probably did when I was younger.  This new direct to video sequel was a disappointment for me as an adult.  The nominal production values encouraged keeping the remote close and my finger on the fast-forward button (the button where you can still hear what's being said, but the film is just slightly sped up).

1254029,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0027CT65E,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Like, zoinks! I wasn't sure what kind of miserable hell I was in for when the kids tuned in to the Cartoon Network and this came on. SCOOBY DOO! THE MYSTERY BEGINS is a live-action movie with a CGI Scooby, only it doesn't trot out Matthew Lillard or Sarah Michelle Gellar, nor was it ever intended for a theaterical release. Instead it debuted on the Cartoon Network in 2009 to commemorate Scooby Doo's 40th anniversary, with a revamped cast of actors and catering more obviously towards the children. The big hook is that it's an origin story. So if you'd ever been curious about how Shaggy met Scooby or how Mystery, Inc. came about, then this is must-see programming. Never mind that it subverts the continuity behind A PUP NAMED SCOOBY DOO (A Pup Named Scooby-Doo: Complete 1st Season) by having the meddling kids meet in high school instead of elementary school.In Coolsville, Ohio, a scuffle on the bus consigns four mismatched kids to the school library on an extended detention, and because John Hughes didn't direct this thing, the kids don't indulge in heavy angst but rather discover their mutual love of mysteries. And when these kids are later accused and suspended from Coolsville High for pulling a supernatural prank, Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville ""Shaggy"" Rogers band together to chase clues and clear themselves. But as bright and enthusiastic as they are, their snooping wouldn't have gotten anywhere if not for the contributions of a ridiculous dog that nobody wanted.As per usual, there's a spooky apparition that eventually gets exposed as a crook rigged up in a silly costume. Mystery, Inc.'s first case involves a time capsule, a suspicious vice-principal, lots of undercover excursions and running away from ghostly attacks, and a turn-of-the-century flood that demolished the town that now lies buried under the present incarnation of Coolsville. SCOOBY DOO! THE MYSTERY BEGINS rides on the strength of forty years' worth of nostalgia, forty years of being invested in these characters from childhood on. Folks not familiar with the cartoon may dismiss how silly it all is, the ghost story and the gags and the ""Zoinks!"" and the ""Jinkies!"" But all that is kind of like comfort food to me. Although it's a contemporary treatment, it's more of an homage to the classic toon than the two theatrical releases ever were. For whatever reason, my favorite nod is the zigzaggy ""ninja"" route Velma applies when sneaking up on some mysterious building. It just struck me as funnier when a real person is doing it. There's also a late montage that references the famous cartoon's opening credits. Anywho, I ended up liking this movie and this unknown cast of actors. We're made privy to the first ever batch of Scooby snacks and to the shaky maiden voyage of the Mystery Machine a.k.a. Daphne's rusty old van. Those devoted to Fred Jones may mourn the absence of the ascot. At least Shaggy and Velma tend to stick with their traditional color schemes.Nitpick: Scooby Doo could've gotten a better CGI treatment, but I realize that this is a made-for-television venture and that the budget probably isn't enough to buy a sack of Scooby snacks. Still, there are too many scenes absent of Scooby Doo. I guess I was okay with this. The kids, though, were clamoring for more of the hyperactive Great Dane, never mind that the film also tries to impart the values of friendship and being observant and taking up the hobby of philately.3.5 out of 5 stars for SCOOBY DOO! THE MYSTERY BEGINS. For those who can't get enough, there's a live-action sequel titledScooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster.",4,"""We didn't do any of this. It really was the ghosts.

Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini were the only good casting as Shaggy and Velma in those movies. While here Nick Palatas and Hayley Kiyoko are also good as Shaggy and Velma. But Robbie Amell at least is a much better Fred than Freddie Prinze Jr. who over-acted and tried too hard to look cool when he just came off dorky. While I liked how Kate Melton doesn't act as dimwitted as Daphne as Sarah Michelle Gellar. Her Daphne is actually pretty smart and uses her brain just as much as Velma.They all bond Breakfast Club style in detention while reading mystery novels. I doubt Sarah Michelle Gellar's Daphne could even read. Daphne isn't meant to be stupid, while Fred was simply just played awful by Freddie Prinze Jr. This movie took a much better approach that's more like the show, well the way the characters act anyway. It didn't really need the scene where Shaggy is testing a gas mask by having Scooby fart lol.

I thought it would be hard to top the original Scooby Doo movie because Matthew Lillard, Freddie Prinze Jr., Rowan Atkinson, Sarah Michelle Gellar lord the whole movie was just an all star cast and very entertaining (to me) in a true Scooby fashion.  However, I think Mystery Begins pulled it off.This is a simple movie, fun for all ages, even those of us who grew up on the old Scooby Cartoons.  I would say that it targets the younger crowd mostly.  A little immature, simple plot, not a lot of special effects or high action scenes.  The only problem I had with the casting was Frank Welker performing the voice of Scooby.  He does a good job, but there is something about it that doesn't click like Neil Fanning's. Nick Palatas shocked me with his performance of Shaggy.  A few spots it seems a little forced, but as a whole he does a great job becoming a very tough character! Kate Melton and Hayley Kiyoko are wonderful as Daphne and Velma and interact very well together.  A very good pair to play a female team. Robbie Amell was a decent Freddy, but he just kinda didn't fit the Freddy look.  His facial structure, build, just is off.  His hair color is distracting (but if you've seen Curse of the Lake Monster, maybe we will see the evolution of the bleach blonde :) But still, I can live with his part.The plot of the movie is very interesting, it caught my attention more than I had expected and it really shows how Mystery Inc. come to grow close to each other.  The ending, however, kind of does away with everything that was built up throughout the movie.  Its just weak and stupid, even for Scooby Doo, I'm sure little kids would even be like ""Seriously?  This is what it all amounts to?""Overall, I do like this movie.  They kept it sweet and simple while keeping the magic of Scooby Doo.  This movie has also led to Curse of the Lake Monster and I do believe the cast was contracted for 3 movies, so I'm sure we can expect another.  I'm very excited, I was hoping for more Scooby movies and these straight to DVD/TV special premiers are doing exceptionally well, so I'm hoping it spawns a more high-budget project.",4,Very nicely done,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,2259,"['was', 'skeptical', 'Mystery', 'Begins', 'first', 'going', 'back', 'doing', 'prequels', 'movies', 'had', 'major', 'failures', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'top', 'original', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movie', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'lord', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'star', 'cast', 'very', 'entertaining', 'true', 'Scooby', 'fashion', 'However', 'think', 'Mystery', 'Begins', 'pulled', 'simple', 'movie', 'fun', 'ages', 'even', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'old', 'Scooby', 'Cartoons', 'would', 'say', 'younger', 'crowd', 'mostly', 'little', 'immature', 'simple', 'plot', 'not', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'high', 'action', 'scenes', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'casting', 'was', 'Frank', 'Welker', 'performing', 'voice', 'Scooby', 'good', 'job', 'something', ""n't"", 'click', 'Neil', 'Fanning', 'Nick', 'Palatas', 'shocked', 'performance', 'Shaggy', 'A', 'few', 'spots', 'little', 'forced', 'whole', 'great', 'job', 'becoming', 'very', 'tough', 'character', 'Kate', 'Melton', 'Hayley', 'Kiyoko', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Daphne', 'Velma', 'interact', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'very', 'good', 'pair', 'play', 'female', 'team', 'Robbie', 'Amell', 'was', 'decent', 'Freddy', 'just', 'kinda', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Freddy', 'look', 'facial', 'structure', 'build', 'just', 'off', 'hair', 'color', 'distracting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Curse', 'Lake', 'Monster', 'maybe', 'will', 'see', 'evolution', 'bleach', 'blonde', 'still', 'can', 'live', 'part.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'caught', 'attention', 'more', 'had', 'expected', 'really', 'how', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'come', 'grow', 'close', 'other', 'ending', 'however', 'kind', 'away', 'everything', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'movie', 'just', 'weak', 'stupid', 'even', 'Scooby', 'Doo', ""'m"", 'sure', 'little', 'kids', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'Seriously', 'what', 'amounts', 'Overall', 'do', 'movie', 'kept', 'sweet', 'simple', 'keeping', 'magic', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movie', 'also', 'led', 'Curse', 'Lake', 'Monster', 'do', 'believe', 'cast', 'was', 'contracted', '3', 'movies', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'expect', ""'m"", 'very', 'excited', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'Scooby', 'movies', 'straight', 'DVD/TV', 'special', 'premiers', 'are', 'doing', 'exceptionally', 'well', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'more', 'high-budget', 'project']",Scooby-Doo!

1254042,A3CNGVESY19NAU,B0027CT65E,MovieGeekFeed.com,"[36, 38]","First, I want everyone to know that I love the first two Scooby-Doo live action films. I thought the casting was done well, the stories were fine, and they looked good. I thought the second one was a little cooler because it had a lot of the ""monsters"" from the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? series coming to life.With that being said, I was a little concerned with this third entry in the series. Usually a movie with this many red flags spells absolute disaster and almost guarantees a turd of a film. Let's spell out the red flags: its direct-to-DVD, it's a prequel, it's totally recast, and it's got a new director. Wow. That's a lot to have going against a movie. Interestingly enough, it didn't prove to be true for this flick.Scooby-Doo: The Mystery Begins somehow rises up above the crowded direct-to-DVD sequel / prequel cesspool and actually is successful at being entertaining and not completely cheap-looking. You can tell that director Brian Levant really wanted to escape the stereotype that these types of movies get and show that he was serious about the subject matter and franchise. Warner definitely played it smart with Levant, being that he is responsible for bringing to the big screen some very successful family movies and iconic animated TV shows like Beethoven, The Flintstones feature films, Jingle All The Way, and Are We There Yet?The casting was done pretty well. All the actors fit the parts, although not without a few minor problems. Robbie Arnell would have completely been convincing in the part of Fred, except that for some reason he wasn't made to bleach his hair blond for the film. What was the reasoning behind that? I mean, he did take the part of an iconic blond character. The least he could have done is bleach his hair out to put the finishing touches on the role. My only other problem was with Nick Palatas' performance as Shaggy. He was really good and definitely looked the part. It just seemed like he was going a little overboard with the cracking squeaky voice sometimes. It seemed a little forced at times. I thought it was cool that they kept Frank Welker as the voice of Scooby-Doo, as he has been doing the character for the past seven years in different series and movies.Even the special effects were done well. The ghosts all looked just as good as any of the ones in the two movies they released in the theaters. I have to say, though, that there were scenes of the Scooby gang that were missing Scooby-Doo that felt kind of awkward. It almost seemed like they cut him out of the scenes to save money on their CGI budget. There were some parts with Scooby that looked a little less than stellar and where it looked like the actor in the shot with him was having trouble interacting with an invisible dog. They were all minor problems, though. It shouldn't take away from your viewing pleasure.Overall, I have to say that I was pretty impressed with this movie. It was kind of fun to see the gang paint The Mystery Machine, meet each other, and solve their first crime together. If you're a Scooby-Doo fan, I'm pretty sure this movie will live up to your standards.",3,Pretty cool straight-to-DVD prequel,1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,3131,"['First', 'want', 'everyone', 'know', 'love', 'first', 'two', 'Scooby-Doo', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'thought', 'casting', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'stories', 'were', 'fine', 'looked', 'good', 'thought', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'little', 'cooler', 'had', 'lot', 'monsters', 'original', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'series', 'coming', 'life.With', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'third', 'entry', 'series', 'Usually', 'movie', 'many', 'red', 'flags', 'spells', 'absolute', 'disaster', 'almost', 'guarantees', 'turd', 'film', 'Let', 'spell', 'out', 'red', 'flags', 'direct-to-DVD', 'prequel', 'totally', 'recast', 'got', 'new', 'director', 'Wow', 'lot', 'have', 'going', 'movie', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'prove', 'be', 'true', 'flick.Scooby-Doo', 'Mystery', 'Begins', 'somehow', 'up', 'crowded', 'direct-to-DVD', 'sequel', '/', 'prequel', 'cesspool', 'actually', 'successful', 'being', 'entertaining', 'not', 'completely', 'cheap-looking', 'can', 'tell', 'director', 'Brian', 'Levant', 'really', 'wanted', 'escape', 'stereotype', 'types', 'movies', 'get', 'show', 'was', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'franchise', 'Warner', 'definitely', 'played', 'Levant', 'being', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'big', 'screen', 'very', 'successful', 'family', 'movies', 'iconic', 'animated', 'TV', 'shows', 'Beethoven', 'Flintstones', 'feature', 'films', 'Jingle', 'Way', 'Are', 'Yet', 'casting', 'was', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'actors', 'fit', 'parts', 'not', 'few', 'minor', 'problems', 'Robbie', 'Arnell', 'would', 'have', 'completely', 'been', 'convincing', 'part', 'Fred', 'reason', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'bleach', 'hair', 'blond', 'film', 'What', 'was', 'reasoning', 'mean', 'did', 'take', 'part', 'iconic', 'blond', 'character', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'bleach', 'hair', 'put', 'finishing', 'touches', 'role', 'only', 'other', 'problem', 'was', 'Nick', 'Palatas', 'performance', 'Shaggy', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'definitely', 'looked', 'part', 'just', 'seemed', 'was', 'going', 'little', 'overboard', 'cracking', 'squeaky', 'voice', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'little', 'forced', 'times', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'kept', 'Frank', 'Welker', 'voice', 'Scooby-Doo', 'been', 'doing', 'character', 'past', 'seven', 'years', 'different', 'series', 'movies.Even', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'ghosts', 'looked', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'ones', 'two', 'movies', 'released', 'theaters', 'have', 'say', 'though', 'were', 'scenes', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'were', 'missing', 'Scooby-Doo', 'felt', 'kind', 'awkward', 'almost', 'seemed', 'cut', 'scenes', 'save', 'money', 'CGI', 'budget', 'were', 'parts', 'Scooby', 'looked', 'little', 'less', 'stellar', 'where', 'looked', 'actor', 'shot', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'interacting', 'invisible', 'dog', 'were', 'minor', 'problems', 'though', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'viewing', 'pleasure.Overall', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'movie', 'was', 'kind', 'fun', 'see', 'gang', 'paint', 'Mystery', 'Machine', 'meet', 'other', 'solve', 'first', 'crime', 'together', ""'re"", 'Scooby-Doo', 'fan', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'movie', 'will', 'live', 'up', 'standards']",Scooby-Doo!

1254045,A39E1JGE8B3ODB,B0027CT65E,ScoobyDooMom,"[1, 1]","First off, let me say that the kid that played Shaggy was written just fine, looked just fine, and SOUNDED dead-on right. He really came across to us like Shaggy Rogers. I did like that they put on the bus the number 1969, that was a cool shout-out for the original series.Scooby was just fine--- except for his introductory storyline. Scooby an abandoned grown dog that no one ever wanted? NO... Scooby and Shaggy had been together since Scooby was a puppy. Even if you IGNORE ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"", they've mentioned it in the original cartoon series. (Also, if you're going to show Shaggy at home, at least MENTION that he has a sister-- her name was Suggie, and they had her on ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"" for one episode (the gang went to her wedding) and on ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"".)Now, for the rest of the ""gang""... No one looked right. Come on, people-- even Freddie Prinze Jr., with his dark haired Latino gorgeousness put on a blonde wig when he was Freddie Jones. (And did a perfect job, as did his wife, Sarah Michelle.) And while Daphne had strawberry blonde hair, it was red enough for acceptability, but... her dress and the way she carried herself... not Daphne. Velma... anyone can put on square glasses and have a severe bob cut, but that doesn't mean you look or sound like Velma. (Linda Cardellini did such a great job it's a hard act to follow, I admit--- Velma looked right off the cartoon but still gorgeous and SOUNDED right...) This girl couldn't act and kept making these... FACES... just the facial expressions killed me.They barely bothered with proper costumes except for Shaggy, which is part of the characters as well. And I don't buy the Mystery Machine being Daphne's-- it was Fred's mostly, or Shaggy's and he let Fred drive. Either way is acceptable. The ""What's New Scooby Doo?"" Theme at the end when they were painting the Mystery Machine, however-- yes, that was adorable, I admit.And I don't buy them not being friends until senior year of high-school; I see them more being friends since grammar school or even junior high. And, Fred was a jock-type, but not a stuck up jerk. I see him in high-school as if someone was bullying his buddy Shaggy, he'd pick them up by the neck and give them a toss.

Don't think so?What about a discipline hungry vice principal who thinks four 'trouble' makers who ruined his 09 Mustang should get detention for a month?  Yeah, that's how Shaggy, Velma, Daphnie, and Fred met, then realized when a ghost appears during their 'time' that something was up.  Common interest in mysteries, and a insatiable need to find out WHY!  Coolsville High School will never be the same once the secret behind the hauntings is uncovered.As with any of the live action Scooby films, we have the Mystery Machine fresh from Dapnhie's garage, Shaggy's basement pad, and the secret behind Scooby snacks.
