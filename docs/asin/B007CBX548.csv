1529797,A2ERH34QNB60FQ,B007CBX548,"Athena R. Schaffer ""The Crowgrrl""","[0, 0]","*The Revenant (no connection to the fantastic Neonfly song of the same name) has currently been making its rounds on the HBO Channels. Since it was a Vampire movie I had not previously heard of, my curiosity was up, so I gave it a watch. It is an extremely low-budget, totally cheesy Dark Comedy. I loved it!Lt. Bart Gregory [David Anders - well-known from Heroes, Warehouse 13, 24, The Vampire Diaries, etc.] was killed in battle. However, after his funeral and burial, he inexplicably comes back from the dead. He seeks out his best friend, Joey (Chris Wylde).One of their mutual friends, Mathilda (Jacy King), trying to make sense of this deduces that Bart is either a Vampire or a Zombie. It's hard to tell at first sight - he's not as suave as most Vampires, but not as deteriorated as a Zombie, despite the weird eyes. Turns out, he's a Vampire. She keeps telling Joey to ""do the right thing"" and decapitate Bart during daylight hours, which Joey can't bring himself to do.Thinking he's been given a Second Chance at living, Bart decides to use his new-found powers and abilities for ""good"", and he and Joey soon find themselves on the evening news as the infamous ""Gunslinging Avengers"" taking out the Los Angeles area's worst criminals (while feeding Bart's need for blood).One nuance Bart & Joey forget to factor in is - how to stop any Vampire's victims from coming back as an Undead themselves. Big mistake! Another big mistake is - Bart's girlfriend Janet (Louise Griffiths) finds out that he's back - after having taken solace in Joey's arms after the funeral.Incredibly surprising and unexpected ending, which I'm NOT going to spoil. You'll have to see for yourself.This is one of the freshest takes on the Vampire in decades. It's a freaking train wreck throughout that you just can't look away from. Plenty of unanticipated surprises laced through the entire movie. You have to see this one at least once!Revenant",4,Review: The Revenant,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1929,"['*The', 'Revenant', 'connection', 'fantastic', 'Neonfly', 'song', 'same', 'name', 'currently', 'been', 'making', 'rounds', 'HBO', 'Channels', 'was', 'Vampire', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'previously', 'heard', 'curiosity', 'was', 'up', 'gave', 'watch', 'extremely', 'low-budget', 'totally', 'cheesy', 'Dark', 'Comedy', 'loved', 'Lt', 'Bart', 'Gregory', '[', 'David', 'Anders', 'well-known', 'Heroes', 'Warehouse', '13', '24', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'etc', ']', 'was', 'killed', 'battle', 'However', 'funeral', 'burial', 'inexplicably', 'back', 'dead', 'out', 'best', 'friend', 'Joey', 'Chris', 'Wylde', '.One', 'mutual', 'friends', 'Mathilda', 'Jacy', 'King', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'deduces', 'Bart', 'Vampire', 'Zombie', 'hard', 'tell', 'first', 'sight', 'not', 'as', 'suave', 'most', 'Vampires', 'not', 'as', 'deteriorated', 'Zombie', 'weird', 'eyes', 'out', 'Vampire', 'telling', 'Joey', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'decapitate', 'Bart', 'daylight', 'hours', 'Joey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'do.Thinking', 'been', 'given', 'Second', 'Chance', 'living', 'Bart', 'use', 'new-found', 'powers', 'abilities', 'good', 'Joey', 'soon', 'find', 'evening', 'news', 'infamous', 'Gunslinging', 'Avengers', 'taking', 'out', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', 'worst', 'criminals', 'feeding', 'Bart', 'need', 'blood', '.One', 'nuance', 'Bart', 'Joey', 'forget', 'factor', 'how', 'stop', 'Vampire', 'victims', 'coming', 'back', 'Undead', 'Big', 'mistake', 'big', 'mistake', 'Bart', 'girlfriend', 'Janet', 'Louise', 'Griffiths', 'out', 'back', 'having', 'taken', 'solace', 'Joey', 'arms', 'funeral.Incredibly', 'surprising', 'unexpected', 'ending', ""'m"", 'NOT', 'going', 'spoil', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'yourself.This', 'one', 'freshest', 'Vampire', 'decades', 'freaking', 'train', 'wreck', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'Plenty', 'unanticipated', 'surprises', 'laced', 'entire', 'movie', 'have', 'see', 'one', 'least', 'once', 'Revenant']",The Revenant [Region B]

1529801,A11L8QJD2JXBUP,B007CBX548,Charles M. Britzman,"[1, 1]","As you've read in the other reviews, this movie is a mixture of humorous and serious moments. Scenes where I wasn't laughing, but was still enthralled included the one where Bart's girlfriend cuts her arm to give him blood, and it turns erotic ; when he agonizes over cutting her head off while in her dormant sleep, to free her from a vampire future ; and his breakdown in the empty subway car after trying to fling himself in front of a subway train, and merely losing an arm. At this point, his girlfriend and his best buddy are both dead, by his hand, and he clearly wishes he was permanently dead himself. The plot dives in and out of serious and humorous sequences with a certain grace that I find pleasurable and well-done. Imagine yourself crawling out of your own casket, not knowing what the Hell is going on, and learning the ropes of being a vampire from scratch. The hunger never leaves you, but your humanity does, eventually, to make way for feeding yourself. Suicide is extremely difficult, and then the hunger overshadows even that.As others have stated, the f-word gets used a lot in conversations between Bart and his best friend, and their friendship was an ""Animal House"" blend of bromance and immature squabbling that was a major vehicle for the humor. It kept things light enough to help out that porpoising in and out of seriousness, but it struck me as going a bit too far in that direction, at times. Something about the way Bart held his head in his hands as he contemplated a choice of horrors before him, or when he was wondering for the thousandth time why this was happening to him, touched me. As he is driven toward an insane, amoral, true vampire's orientation near the end , I wasn't laughing, and it was easy to forget the silliness elsewhere in the movie. I may have read tragedy into moments that were meant as humorous tragedy, but the acting was there, and I felt only pity for Bart. For me, Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" comes to mind as an example of a similar mixture of humor within an overarching horror. The humor is a delivery vector for solemn insights that are perhaps equally applicable to less supernatural stories. You decide.But it didn't stop me from laughing when, say, Bart talks with his vampire friend's severed head in an unexpected and hilarious way.  I also think the undead makeup and props were very convincing, and the scope of the events in the story was well matched by the relatively modest budget. IMHO the movie didn't ""look"" cheap at all, but it may suffer from comparison to bigger-budget 'undead' movies like ""World War Z"", with a cast of thousands(mostly pricey CGI, of course). David Anders' portrayal of the hapless Revenant Bart was very convincing, and funny, but I thought it worthwhile to point out that, between the laughs, he makes us care.",4,THE RELUCTANT REVENANT,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,2816,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'movie', 'mixture', 'humorous', 'serious', 'moments', 'Scenes', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'laughing', 'was', 'still', 'enthralled', 'included', 'one', 'where', 'Bart', 'girlfriend', 'arm', 'give', 'blood', 'erotic', 'when', 'cutting', 'head', 'off', 'while', 'dormant', 'sleep', 'free', 'vampire', 'future', 'breakdown', 'empty', 'subway', 'car', 'trying', 'fling', 'front', 'subway', 'train', 'merely', 'losing', 'arm', 'point', 'girlfriend', 'best', 'buddy', 'are', 'dead', 'hand', 'clearly', 'was', 'permanently', 'dead', 'plot', 'serious', 'humorous', 'sequences', 'certain', 'grace', 'find', 'pleasurable', 'well-done', 'Imagine', 'crawling', 'own', 'casket', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'Hell', 'going', 'learning', 'ropes', 'being', 'vampire', 'scratch', 'hunger', 'never', 'humanity', 'eventually', 'make', 'way', 'feeding', 'Suicide', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'then', 'hunger', 'even', 'that.As', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'f-word', 'used', 'lot', 'conversations', 'Bart', 'best', 'friend', 'friendship', 'was', 'Animal', 'House', 'blend', 'bromance', 'immature', 'squabbling', 'was', 'major', 'vehicle', 'humor', 'kept', 'things', 'light', 'enough', 'help', 'out', 'porpoising', 'seriousness', 'struck', 'going', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'direction', 'times', 'Something', 'way', 'Bart', 'held', 'head', 'hands', 'contemplated', 'choice', 'horrors', 'when', 'was', 'wondering', 'thousandth', 'time', 'why', 'was', 'happening', 'touched', 'driven', 'insane', 'amoral', 'true', 'vampire', 'orientation', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'laughing', 'was', 'easy', 'forget', 'silliness', 'elsewhere', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'read', 'tragedy', 'moments', 'were', 'meant', 'humorous', 'tragedy', 'acting', 'was', 'there', 'felt', 'only', 'pity', 'Bart', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Brazil', 'mind', 'example', 'similar', 'mixture', 'humor', 'overarching', 'horror', 'humor', 'delivery', 'vector', 'solemn', 'insights', 'are', 'perhaps', 'equally', 'applicable', 'less', 'supernatural', 'stories', 'decide.But', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'when', 'say', 'Bart', 'vampire', 'friend', 'severed', 'head', 'unexpected', 'hilarious', 'way', 'also', 'think', 'undead', 'makeup', 'props', 'were', 'very', 'convincing', 'scope', 'events', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'matched', 'relatively', 'modest', 'budget', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'cheap', 'may', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'bigger-budget', ""'undead"", 'movies', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'cast', 'thousands', 'mostly', 'CGI', 'course', 'David', 'Anders', 'portrayal', 'hapless', 'Revenant', 'Bart', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'funny', 'thought', 'point', 'out', 'laughs', 'care']",The Revenant [Region B]

1529810,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007CBX548,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","It's nice to see original movies coming out these days with the tons of remakes and sequels that seem to dominate theaters. Unfortunately these original films never seem to make it to the local theater and almost always end up going unseen until they arrive on DVD. For a film lover that means that DVD is the best way to find the newest items. Such is the case with THE REVENANT.Bart Gregory (David Anders) is a soldier killed in action as the film opens. Just who killed him and how isn't quite certain but his body is returned home, given the full honors of a fallen soldier and he's laid to rest. Well not quite. That evening Bart digs his way out of his grave and heads to the home of his best friend Joey (Chris Wylde).Of course this scares Joey at first but then he begins to worry about his friend. Thinking he's probably starving he makes him something to eat only to have Bart toss his cookies, an odd looking black ooze, on the floor. As the pair try and figure out what must have happened, they eventually decide that Bart must be one of the living dead and in need of fresh blood. Who says watching all those old horror films doesn't pay off.?The pair begins by robbing blood from blood banks but inadvertently they discover another way to get the blood Bart needs. Stopping a crime they find that bullets have no effect on Bart. Invulnerable he stops the crime, kills the bad guy and then drinks his blood. A new crime fighting hero is born! It's as if Rambo rose from the dead and began taking back the streets from criminals.Bart and Joey are suddenly in the spotlight though unseen. Because they're saving people from criminals the victims never offer good descriptions. Why would they want harm to come to those who helped them? Learning that the criminals they kill rise as well, the duo dispose of the bodies as they go along, something that will come back to haunt them later in the film.Bart also reconnects with his fianc&eacute; as well. Of course this lends itself to a rather awkward moment, especially when he learns that she and Joey slept together when they thought he was dead. But time heals all...well most...wounds and they are reunited once more.Everything seems to be going smoothly for the pair until Joey gets shot during one of their encounters with bad guys. Rather than let his friend die, Bart turns Joey into a member of the living dead as well. But Joey has always been a screw up and he soon lets his new found powers go to his head. When one of their first victims returns for some vengeance of his own, there's no telling what will happen.There are several things that make this film work. One is that they treat the subject matter as if it were real, as if it truly could happen. In so doing the movie has a certain vibe to it that makes the viewer think okay I can see that happening. The second thing it has going for it is a nice mix of comedy and horror that works as well. Scenes between the main pair are hilarious at times. A good example (seen in the trailer) is when they get in a fight and start shooting each other knowing good and well that they're both invulnerable.The acting is done well here especially by the leads who must convince viewers that this is a plausible concept. The effects are done well and not too far over the top, something that could have ruined the film completely. The movie won't be one that everyone will love but horror and comedy fans will both be happy with the end product.",4,ZOMBIE RAMBO,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,3463,"['nice', 'see', 'original', 'movies', 'coming', 'days', 'tons', 'remakes', 'sequels', 'seem', 'dominate', 'theaters', 'Unfortunately', 'original', 'films', 'never', 'seem', 'make', 'local', 'theater', 'almost', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'unseen', 'arrive', 'DVD', 'film', 'lover', 'DVD', 'best', 'way', 'find', 'newest', 'items', 'Such', 'case', 'THE', 'REVENANT.Bart', 'Gregory', 'David', 'Anders', 'soldier', 'killed', 'action', 'film', 'Just', 'who', 'killed', 'how', ""n't"", 'quite', 'certain', 'body', 'returned', 'home', 'given', 'full', 'honors', 'fallen', 'soldier', 'laid', 'rest', 'Well', 'not', 'quite', 'evening', 'Bart', 'way', 'grave', 'heads', 'home', 'best', 'friend', 'Joey', 'Chris', 'Wylde', '.Of', 'course', 'Joey', 'first', 'then', 'worry', 'friend', 'Thinking', 'probably', 'starving', 'something', 'eat', 'only', 'have', 'Bart', 'toss', 'cookies', 'odd', 'looking', 'black', 'ooze', 'floor', 'pair', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'happened', 'eventually', 'decide', 'Bart', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'living', 'dead', 'need', 'fresh', 'blood', 'Who', 'watching', 'old', 'horror', 'films', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'pair', 'robbing', 'blood', 'blood', 'banks', 'inadvertently', 'discover', 'way', 'get', 'blood', 'Bart', 'Stopping', 'crime', 'find', 'bullets', 'have', 'effect', 'Bart', 'Invulnerable', 'crime', 'bad', 'guy', 'then', 'drinks', 'blood', 'new', 'crime', 'fighting', 'hero', 'born', 'Rambo', 'rose', 'dead', 'began', 'taking', 'back', 'streets', 'criminals.Bart', 'Joey', 'are', 'suddenly', 'spotlight', 'unseen', ""'re"", 'saving', 'people', 'criminals', 'victims', 'never', 'offer', 'good', 'descriptions', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'harm', 'come', 'who', 'helped', 'Learning', 'criminals', 'kill', 'rise', 'as', 'well', 'duo', 'dispose', 'bodies', 'go', 'along', 'something', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'later', 'film.Bart', 'also', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'rather', 'awkward', 'moment', 'especially', 'when', 'Joey', 'slept', 'together', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'dead', 'time', 'heals', 'well', 'most', 'wounds', 'are', 'reunited', 'once', 'more.Everything', 'be', 'going', 'smoothly', 'pair', 'Joey', 'shot', 'one', 'encounters', 'bad', 'guys', 'Rather', 'let', 'friend', 'die', 'Bart', 'Joey', 'member', 'living', 'dead', 'as', 'well', 'Joey', 'always', 'been', 'screw', 'up', 'soon', 'new', 'found', 'powers', 'go', 'head', 'When', 'one', 'first', 'victims', 'returns', 'vengeance', 'own', 'telling', 'what', 'will', 'happen.There', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'One', 'treat', 'subject', 'matter', 'were', 'real', 'truly', 'could', 'happen', 'so', 'doing', 'movie', 'certain', 'vibe', 'viewer', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'happening', 'second', 'thing', 'going', 'nice', 'mix', 'comedy', 'horror', 'as', 'well', 'Scenes', 'main', 'pair', 'are', 'hilarious', 'times', 'good', 'example', 'seen', 'trailer', 'when', 'get', 'fight', 'start', 'shooting', 'other', 'knowing', 'good', 'well', ""'re"", 'invulnerable.The', 'acting', 'done', 'well', 'here', 'especially', 'leads', 'who', 'must', 'convince', 'viewers', 'plausible', 'concept', 'effects', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'top', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'ruined', 'film', 'completely', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'everyone', 'will', 'love', 'horror', 'comedy', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'end', 'product']",The Revenant [Region B]

It links the `Death Wish' revenge theme with the undead zombie theme. The basic synopsis is our hero Bart (David Anders) is killed on active duty in Iraq. His body is repatriated and a grieving girlfriend and best mate bury him. The preacher is one of those full on sanctimonious Bible bashers that insinuates that Bart may not have embraced the Lord enough in life to be welcomed through the Pearly gates, so we should all take note. This gets best mate Joey (Chris Wylde) thinking if his best friend may actually have gone to Hell.Well he needn't have fretted, as later that night he gets a knock at the door and a voice from the past calls out. Yes you guessed right, Bart has returned, and after some initial scepticism Joey takes in his old mate, but he soon has to make a trip to the Emergency Room after Bart finds he can't process normal food, the penny finally drops when the Hospital goes mental at the thought of the living dead. After some inter web research Joey realises he is neither Vampire nor Zombie, so they decide he is a Revenant - from the French for one who has come back after a long time, often from the assumed dead.Then they get mugged and after a tussle they realise that Bart can have a steady food supply and do society some good by killing criminals and homeless and drug dealers and just about anyone that they consider bad.This is billed as a riotous comedy and it does have some very dark humour but not belly laugh stuff, the gore is pretty full on though. The actual story is the real strength, and the twists are far from obvious or sign posted. I agree this is to be feted as a cult classic very soon, but 'Dead Heads' is way funnier, this though has more pathos, and much better make up. There is also a great homage to `Dirty Harry' which you have to see. I really enjoyed this great film but needs viewing caution as we have some so called `strong language' and lots of gore/violence and loads of shooting.This is not a full on Zombie fest but it is a new take on the subject and I prefer a sentient Zombie to the slow walking drooling sort that is the norm, this also plays it straight despite the humour, it is not camped up like say `Gory Gory Hallelujah', which I also liked.
