Yet again it's Playboy so what can you expect? The women are great and if you're into the whole fantasy situation scenario then get it.

No doubt many of the respondants were glamor-model-wannabes and given the pay rates they must get at Walmart who can blame them?  I wonder about the selection criteria for the finalists presented here, though.  I'm not a fan of tattoos, depilation and shall we say ""attachments"" - if you are then this is for you, but frankly I think the finalists look sexier with clothes on than with them off.

796179,A3C5ZZQ143WG6T,B0001906OK,Jenifer M,"[39, 46]","This was the first Playboy ""Women of..."" video I had ever seen.  I don't know what I was expecting, but all of the girls seemed like the real articles - girls who worked for Wal-Mart.  They were all very sincere, all very excited, all very grateful for being invited to pose for Playboy.  And they were all from very small towns scattered all across America.Fortunately, the video didn't spend too much time getting to the good parts.  The girls would arrive for the shoot, be ushered into make-up, and before you know it, would start to slowly undress for the camera - taking off their Wal-Mart vests and getting down to basics - with the camera giving us more than a few nice glimpses between modestly parted thighs to reassure us that the young women had indeed gone all of the way (to naked).Some of the babes, like Beth (a leggy brunette with beautiful eyes) in the opening segment, and Tesha (a busty, high cheekboned blonde with waist-length hair) right after her, were definitely quite cute.  Other girls were less so.  The one thing they all had in common was a very nice figure (even though their breast sizes ranged all over the map).  After make-up, though -- they all looked gorgeous!  (And if I were a guy -- that would worry me!)Strangely, all of the Playboy employees at the shoot came across just like normal people.  One of the make-up artists, in fact, looked a lot like my best friend's mom.  And the photographers (of which there were several) could've just as easily been shooting cars, or food - instead of naked women!  I mean, there weren't any overly handsome John Derek types (Bo Derek's husband) trying to seduce the girls with their voice as they photographed them.  In fact, most of the video footage of the women posing nude looked more like behind-the-scenes outtakes - with the sexiest shots being the glossy stills the video would flash on screen - where all of the girls looked fantastic!I think most guys might see this video as being a bit tame.  But I think many gals might find it entertaining, especially those that enjoy watching the feminine form (as I do).  The message I took away from the movie was -- if a girl is willing to take off her clothes, it's still possible for Playboy to make her feel -- like a Cinderella for a day!  I thought each of the girls delivered this message very warmly and sincerely, and I ended up liking this video a lot!",5,Cinderellas for a day!,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,2392,"['was', 'first', 'Playboy', 'Women', 'video', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'girls', 'seemed', 'real', 'articles', 'girls', 'who', 'worked', 'Wal-Mart', 'were', 'very', 'sincere', 'very', 'excited', 'very', 'grateful', 'being', 'invited', 'pose', 'Playboy', 'were', 'very', 'small', 'towns', 'scattered', 'America.Fortunately', 'video', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'getting', 'good', 'parts', 'girls', 'would', 'arrive', 'shoot', 'be', 'ushered', 'make-up', 'know', 'would', 'start', 'slowly', 'undress', 'camera', 'taking', 'off', 'Wal-Mart', 'vests', 'getting', 'down', 'basics', 'camera', 'giving', 'more', 'few', 'nice', 'glimpses', 'modestly', 'parted', 'thighs', 'reassure', 'young', 'women', 'had', 'indeed', 'gone', 'way', 'naked', '.Some', 'babes', 'Beth', 'leggy', 'brunette', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'opening', 'segment', 'Tesha', 'busty', 'high', 'cheekboned', 'blonde', 'waist-length', 'hair', 'right', 'were', 'definitely', 'quite', 'cute', 'Other', 'girls', 'were', 'less', 'so', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'common', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'figure', 'even', 'breast', 'sizes', 'ranged', 'map', 'make-up', 'though', 'looked', 'gorgeous', 'were', 'guy', 'would', 'worry', 'Strangely', 'Playboy', 'employees', 'shoot', 'came', 'across', 'just', 'normal', 'people', 'One', 'make-up', 'artists', 'fact', 'looked', 'lot', 'best', 'friend', 'mom', 'photographers', 'were', 'several', 'could', ""'ve"", 'just', 'easily', 'been', 'shooting', 'cars', 'food', 'instead', 'naked', 'women', 'mean', 'were', ""n't"", 'overly', 'handsome', 'John', 'Derek', 'types', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'husband', 'trying', 'seduce', 'girls', 'voice', 'photographed', 'fact', 'most', 'video', 'footage', 'women', 'posing', 'nude', 'looked', 'more', 'behind-the-scenes', 'outtakes', 'sexiest', 'shots', 'being', 'glossy', 'video', 'would', 'flash', 'screen', 'where', 'girls', 'looked', 'fantastic', 'think', 'most', 'guys', 'might', 'see', 'video', 'being', 'bit', 'tame', 'think', 'many', 'gals', 'might', 'find', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'feminine', 'form', 'do', 'message', 'took', 'away', 'movie', 'was', 'girl', 'willing', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'still', 'possible', 'Playboy', 'make', 'feel', 'Cinderella', 'day', 'thought', 'girls', 'delivered', 'message', 'very', 'warmly', 'sincerely', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'video', 'lot']",Playboy - Women of Wal-Mart

Playboy was always a weak rag, and their videos are just as boring. The only reason Playboy has stayed in business for over 50 years is because of the occasional celebrity who needs the money.I watched this DVD at a friend's house. He collects all these stupid Playboy DVDs and was excited to throw this one in. Hugh Hefner must think he's gonna make a fortune off this from trailer park dwellers who'll sell a pint of blood plasma or recycle beer cans to get this.I've been in Wal-Marts all over the country and I have never, never, NEVER seen any employee looking anywhere near what was portrayed in this. Like I'm supposed this girl 'Tesha' is an actual employee? She has long blonde hair to her butt and has a rack that defies gravity. Yeah sure, I can see her calling up a price check on a case of Sam's Grape soda.The typical Wal-Mart employees I've seen are 80 year old women who hand you a cart on your way in. You can even hear their colostomy bag sloshing around as they say 'Welcome to WalMart'. Or you got the 350 lbs Jamaican woman at the register with three inch nails painted red and orange. She has a dreadlock weave, a diamond nose ring, gold tooth, and shouts at the top of her lungs ""I need a price check on Depends Undergarments!""This is bottom of the barrel, even for Playboy.
