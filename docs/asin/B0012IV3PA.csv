1137083,A21V79LYT2Q5PH,B0012IV3PA,"A. D. Anderson ""Flying Gamer""","[7, 11]","I picked this up to quench my thirst for the paranormal between Ghost Hunter DVD releases.  I was hoping for something that would continue in their vein of ""skeptic"" research.  When I saw the Penn State name attached to this series I actually hoped for progression.  In my wildest dreams an actual professor/doctor had decided to conduct some real research into the paranormal.  Boy, was I a fool.  ""Paranormal State"" is nothing more than a group of very young college kids (no Ph.D.s here) who drag paranormal research back down to what it was before Ghost Hunters started airing.  Psychics and witches rejoice!  Anything and everything goes.  Did I just hear a mouse fart?  No!  It was a ghost!  They even give serious consideration to a game called ""100 Candles,""  which I would've thought was ridiculous if I'd played it when I was twelve.  Very little is presented in the way of objective evidence.  A few EVPs come up, but they're unconvincing.  Someone ""sees"" a shadow, but it's never caught on tape (again: see Ghost Hunters for impressive, somewhat objective evidence).  And my favorite:  motion detectors that go off, but you can't see what tripped them because... the camera is in another room!  Are you kidding me?  How do you set up a motion detector and not have a camera next to it to see what set it off?  I know this is far-fetched, guys, but maybe, just maybe, there is a mouse or two in a house that has been deserted for six months.  And then there are the psychics.  Chip Coffey actually started to impress me until he started communicating with the dead.  Dead dogs that is.  Then they found a grave of a dog and dug it up.  Very disgusting.  It's head was missing, which I guess made it paranormal.  Or maybe it had something to do with that highway running through the front yard.  They never present this fact, though.  You have to look to notice that the house is in the country and that there is a highway about 50 feet away from the front door.  Way to present the facts, guys.  It's things like this that will insult you if you're intelligent.  You'll eat it up if you're not.",2,Hard to recommend.

As a Christian I view this subject in the same light. That said it does not mean I agree 100%. The differences being the Protestant / Catholic view. Some have said that this is a better series than TAPS. I agree but they have two different approaches to this subject. TAPS tries to disprove a haunting first. It takes alot to convince Jason before he claims a haunting. The fact they don't try to ""Clean up the mess"" is due to their Belief system (Spiritual) or lack of.  I too have experienced some paranormal events in my life. Thankfully not as extensive as some of PS cases but enough to know somethings out there. I do advise that children do not view this show till they are spiritually mature. You do not want them to ""Open Doors"" as some episodes will reveal.

If you believe the one person who apparently could not be helped or was expecting them to be the second coming and cleanse the house forever, than it is fake.  But, it seems in all the cases the PRS has studied, there seems to be only ONE couple that has said they are fakers.  Why say that?  I don't know.  My question is, if the lady was psychic, why did she need PRS in the first place?  Shouldn't she be able to handle one ghost ""who has a message to pass on""?  Any rate, I like the approach taken here.  They seem to genuinely want to help the people in the cases.  If they are in over their heads, they say so and get someone in who can help them.  I do think they do try and debunk as much as possible, however it is only a half hour show and they can't show everything.  So I think they only show what they believe to be paranormal.

Yes, there are some ""good"" & there is ""Evil"". Understand this before watching, this is not just entertainment, this 3 DVD set of Paranormal State Season 1 is also a teaching tool. You will figure that out quickly.MAKE SURE YOU ARE PURCHASING THE 3 DVD COLLECTION OF PARANORMAL STATE. I was not disappointed with my purchase at all.Mr. Buell & another of the team, will discuss one or more of the cases under the ""Comentary"" section on each DVD. Do NOT skip the commentary section, as you will miss important information which helps the watcher understand that PRS Research is not a straight line. Things may go bump in the night, but the PRS crew led by Ryan Buell do not just look to find spirits & the paranormal. I'm amazed at how careful, how intuitive, how respectful, and protective PRS are about the clients.I'm glad that I chose to watch the comentary, as I had been scratching my head wondering why certain conversations appeared stumbling & out of whack during one episode. Apparently, as the team is older then younger & older again, the episodes are not always in chronological order; but that takes nothing away from the experience. I highly recommend this Paranormal State Season 1 collection for anyone interested in or experiences the paranormal. This is the real deal, unlike the copy cat type shows who show or say nothing about their ""findings."" GET THIS COLLECTION OF PARANORMAL STATE SEASON 1, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT-BUT YOU WILL JUMP & you might want to leave a lighton a night or two.The PRS Team have their own websites, one in conjunction with the channel that airs the show & another, where one can get written information about certain shows that may not be on the DVD. There is plenty of extra information on the ""Commentary"" section on each DVD of Paranormal State Season 1. It's also interesting watching the PRS team grow, while watching. They each refine their interview skills, learn respect for elders (I don't want to spoil it), learn to become comfortable in their own skin. Each member brings various skill sets with them, watching each hone those skills is incredible. Ryan Buell's faith, along with the faith of others, aids him along the way.IMPORTANT:Paranormal State (any season) SHOULD NOT be shown to any child under the age of 15-17. It does not matter how great you are at explaining to your children about tv, etc., these experiences are REAL!",5,Paranormal State 3 DVD Collection A MUST HAVE,1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,2704,"['was', 'able', 'get', '3DVD', 'Set', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Season', '1', 'LOVE', 'goosebump', 'jump', ""'WHOA"", 'mouth', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Season', '1', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'collection', 'anyone', 'who', 'interest', 'understanding', 'who', 'have', 'left', 'world', 'yet', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'are', 'dead', 'Yes', 'are', 'good', 'Evil', 'Understand', 'watching', 'not', 'just', 'entertainment', '3', 'DVD', 'set', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Season', '1', 'also', 'teaching', 'tool', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'quickly.MAKE', 'SURE', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'PURCHASING', 'THE', '3', 'DVD', 'COLLECTION', 'OF', 'PARANORMAL', 'STATE', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'purchase', 'all.Mr', 'Buell', 'team', 'will', 'discuss', 'one', 'more', 'cases', 'Comentary', 'section', 'DVD', 'Do', 'NOT', 'skip', 'commentary', 'section', 'will', 'miss', 'important', 'information', 'watcher', 'understand', 'PRS', 'Research', 'not', 'straight', 'line', 'Things', 'may', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'PRS', 'crew', 'led', 'Ryan', 'Buell', 'do', 'not', 'just', 'look', 'find', 'spirits', 'paranormal', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'how', 'careful', 'how', 'intuitive', 'how', 'respectful', 'protective', 'PRS', 'are', 'clients.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'chose', 'watch', 'comentary', 'had', 'been', 'scratching', 'head', 'wondering', 'why', 'certain', 'conversations', 'appeared', 'stumbling', 'whack', 'one', 'episode', 'Apparently', 'team', 'older', 'then', 'younger', 'older', 'again', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'chronological', 'order', 'nothing', 'away', 'experience', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Season', '1', 'collection', 'anyone', 'interested', 'experiences', 'paranormal', 'real', 'deal', 'copy', 'cat', 'type', 'shows', 'who', 'show', 'say', 'nothing', 'findings', 'THIS', 'COLLECTION', 'OF', 'PARANORMAL', 'STATE', 'SEASON', '1', 'YOU', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'REGRET', 'IT-BUT', 'YOU', 'WILL', 'JUMP', 'might', 'want', 'leave', 'lighton', 'night', 'two.The', 'PRS', 'Team', 'have', 'own', 'websites', 'one', 'conjunction', 'channel', 'show', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'written', 'information', 'certain', 'shows', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'extra', 'information', 'Commentary', 'section', 'DVD', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Season', '1', 'also', 'interesting', 'watching', 'PRS', 'team', 'grow', 'watching', 'refine', 'interview', 'skills', 'learn', 'respect', 'elders', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'learn', 'become', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'member', 'various', 'skill', 'sets', 'watching', 'hone', 'skills', 'incredible', 'Ryan', 'Buell', 'faith', 'faith', 'others', 'aids', 'way.IMPORTANT', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'season', 'SHOULD', 'NOT', 'be', 'shown', 'child', 'age', '15-17', 'not', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'are', 'explaining', 'children', 'tv', 'etc.', 'experiences', 'are', 'REAL']",Paranormal State: Season 1

I feel like it's deserving of one star or less, but one star stands for ""I hate it."" I'll at least say that I don't HATE it, but that's about the only positive thing. I bought seasons 1-3 for $10 (which would be a good deal if this was anything worthy) at a yard sale. I've seen all the episodes from those seasons and repeatedly found plenty to be disappointed in.Originally, I posted this with a whole lot of information, but it was getting so long. . .and I keep finding more and more. Thus, I removed a lot and will be making a video instead that will eventually be here or elsewhere.Here are a few annoyances:- You see moments after what would have been the commercial break that are different. For example, in one we have this 'psychic' talking about feeling a little girl who was murdered. Before the break, Ryan took off the hood of a jacket from his head. Afterwards, it was already off and the 'psychic' said the same words of how 'I think she was murdered.' So, she repeated her words at different times and the hood was off at different times. Also, things said at times include MORE information than the first time they were spoken. With episodes having about 20 minutes of time, except for the occasional double-length ones, obviously a lot is cut out. The retakes of scenes should at least be more accurate.- I think it's silly that the 'psychics' are usually spot-on with many things...and then we frequently see members of PRS doing historical research to validate what they heard. Of course, the 'psychic' could easily have done the same thing first or found something on the internet before visiting a place. It always shows whoever the 'psychic' or 'medium' is pulling up to a place in a vehicle -- so they surely knew the address and might have researched or called someone up. Or just gotten details from people involved in the show. In every instance, team leader Ryan asks the guest ""I haven't told you anything about the place, right?"" and the visitor would say that he hasn't mentioned anything. Maybe so, but it's not proof that the 'psychic' definitely has no knowledge going into the location.- The stupid audio-effects are annoying to the extreme. I don't want to hear fake heartbeats or whatever. Let me have total silence. Let me hear what is being heard in the room where everyone is, for crying out loud. I can't count the times someone said ""Did you just hear that?"" and I responded ""No...there are stupid sound effects interrupting."" I remember a time where they played a couple creepy music notes and I was saying ""Wow...that's a pretty-impressive for a ghost. I guess it's carrying a piano around.""- In one episode, I was so surprised to see what looked like a person on the team WHO WAS JUST A CLIENT IN AN EARLIER EPISODE! To see her sitting at this table -- and it was the only time I saw her in the episode (and her name was different) -- was amazingly terrible. The likeness was completely similar and I thought right away 'Oh, come on! It's that same person I saw before!'Oh, there are SO many thing in this to make it one of the worst in TV history, but I again wanted to keep this shorter. This is just a bad show. Cramming stuff into 20 minutes is stupid. The silly sound effects ruin everything and the creators are just trying to make the atmosphere more suspenseful and have it seem like the team is capturing more phenomena then they are. ""Did you hear that?"" statements run rampant and many times the viewer didn't hear what the participants supposedly heard because of an added audio effect or music. It's extremely rare when you can actually hear what is supposedly happening and there's nothing interfering.""Ghost Adventures"", only in the first few seasons, genuinely had this skeptic curious and I was even spooked watching it the dark. I don't believe everything that's in that show either, but I surely enjoyed it more (again, only in the early seasons) despite all of the incredibly terrible EVP's they frequently have and claim to understand.""Paranormal State""'s a TV show; it's meant to just entertain. There's a lot of ridiculousness and it's not that entertaining to begin with. Apparently, there's now a followup to this show (since it's over) called ""Paranormal State: THE NEW CLASS"" (something like that). I have no interesting in finding out if it's as terrible as this is.I think it's interesting to hear certain stories from the PS show, but there's so little 'evidence' ever captured/shown. In my own investigations, the stories and history are the most interesting to me and not the moments of just speaking to the air or taking photos. I had the most fun with this show when I was noticing how bad it is with mistakes/fraudulent moments/dumb ideas and realizing how I -- even as a skeptic -- do better.",2,this is the ULTIMATE....state

1137107,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B0012IV3PA,Micheal Hunt,"[6, 8]","When I picked up this DVD for a bargain, I thought it was going to be the best bit of pocket change I had spent in a long time on a movie. Even my g/f was excited to start watching this. I mean, how can you go wrong, people investigating haunted places and over analyzing every little sound heard around the place at night... even tho I don't beleive any of these kind of things are real, and are just playing it up in order to make entertainment, this one here, I am sad to say, has got to be the most annoying of them all.Why? Too much religious nonsense, that's why. Now the show itself would be ok, if they didn't have a bunch of useless people who are part of the posse and giving unneeded, and unwanted input into ""this place is creepy, I want to leave"" lines, and they usually do leave. But what makes me cringe more, is that this is, and I swear it's true, this is the kind of paranormal show for born again Christians. Being an atheist, it's just eye rolling to me that this guy's intro to every show is talking about how something happened to him as a kid, and he's been investigating paranormal activity since... but get this, get this.. it's hilarious... as you progress through the first season, a psychic picks up on the presence of a demon... wait, stay with me here... but this demon is not actually haunting the place they are in... no, it's following the main investigator around, and telling him to get ready to battle, because the time to square off is coming... I swear, I may have re-worded that a bit, but that's exactly what is going on in this season! To paint a better picture, imagine you are watching Ghost Hunters, and then Zuul and Goza start issuing challenges to the group, and saying, SOON we are going to battle. BWUAHAHAHAHA... Oh man, this show is pathetic.The other thing I could not stand was that at the end of each show, which is usually a victory for them somehow because they have exorcized the demons to go away, they all huddle and pray... yes, you read that right, they pray and thank god. I may be atheist, but I know so many religious beliefs don't even beleive in demons or the devil, but this team here and their ghost-busting leader of prayer sure do. It becomes too annoying after seeing this in every episode, so annoying that I could not finish watching the rest of the season. I don't even care if it does build up to a big show down with this apparent demon that is following him around and issuing open challenges for a shot at the world title. This show just has way too much BS in it for my liking... and it's far from entertainment, as most of it is just this moron talking about his past, present and future, and just standing around staring with the exact same blunt look on his face when someone else is talking. This guy has had a complete charismatic bypass.So if you think you would enjoy Ghosthunters with prayer and a demon stalker thrown in, by all means, check out the show... but if you think that sounds like a really lame idea for a show, then yeah, don't bother.P.S: Anyone want my DVD copy? Just pay for the P&H; and it's yours for free. They might make really a good Frisbee or a drink coaster.P.P.S: I just read the other reviews here about this show being proven to be a scam.

For me it all started with the U.K's Most Haunted, it was a very entertaining show until they started with their fake table movings, knocks and personal attacks. Then there is Ghost Hunters. Ghost Hunters usually have alot of nothing going on, but still is interesting when they do catch something. Now there is Paranormal State. Why is Paranormal State so great. First of all not much happens here which leads me to believe that nothing is staged or fake on the show. The Best part of the show are the psychics who come in for a visit. Chip Coffey is overdramtic and funny when he demands, We Need An Exorcism. I get really excited when psychic Lorraine Warren pops on in an episode here and there.  I loved when Chip was in a trance and Lorainne smacked him in the face to wake him up. Funny Stuff Here. But the main characters are the people themselves. Half of them are crazy and looney and our host Ryan usually feels sorry for them by the end of every episode. There are plenty of scares and interesting findings in the show. I just hope they keep it real and put Chip and Lorainne on every episode.

I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E;) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.Paranormal State also leans a little bit too much, perhaps, on Catholicism, but I love the protection chant: ""The Light of God Surrounds Us. The Love of God Enfolds Us. The Power of God Protects Us."" It's a great mantra!!!Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one.

One is Chip Coffey.  He is a ""medium"" who can supposedly communicate telepathically with the dead.  And Lorraine something or other who was the lead investigator of the original Amittyville Horror case decades ago.  They also use what they call ""Dead Time"" which is 3:00am which has been said to be the most active time in the spirit world.  How spirits know what time it is in the real world in any given time zone, who knows?  But it is a fascinating idea and usually produces results.  Something I wish Jason and Grant would use in T.A.P.S.  They also use a variety of religious ceremonies/rituals to rid premises of the unwanted or trapped spirits, which in of itself goes one step further than T.A.P.S. does.In one of the most recent episodes, they've used a new device called ""Frank's Box"" which apparently combines white noise, pink noise and several other spectrums of sound waves and outputs them through its speaker.  It is essentially a ""telephone to the dead"".  Because you can get instant EVP feedback and actually get direct real-time answers to questions.  The session in which it was used, it got clear feedback that ""there is 7 [spirits]"", one was named ""Lucy"", and that there was ""a demon"" present.  Very spooky stuff.Now then, the episodes are of the 30 minute variety.  Yeah, I know, I wished they were an hour long, but they're very entertaining and unlike Ghosthunters, you actually get to see and hear ""actual"" paranormal activity.  The episodes have aired on A&E; in full HD widescreen so the DVDs should be very excellent in terms of video quality.

They don't call a place haunted lightly (although they seem to be calling more places haunted in later episodes, as though they are selling out for the ratings). Paranormal State (which could be renamed B.S.U) however apparently knows just where to go to get an alleged hit EVERY time they go out. They show nothing to support their claims that something is actually happening. Film evidence? Nope. Infrared camera? Nothing. Their EVPs, when they have them? Questionable. (And don't even get me started on the Frank's Box that allows them to talk to the ghosts AND get immediate responses) What do we have to go on? Their on-call psychic, Chip Coffey(?).
