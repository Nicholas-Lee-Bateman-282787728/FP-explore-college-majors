Let's see if I can clarify. There are a couple top rated actors in the movie, the main actress was a Miss World winner that was a professional ballet dancer in reality. The story line was that she uses her ballet skills to achieve her goals. Scenery, videography and editing was decent, the angles and colors were brilliantly shot. The dialogue although a little cheesy in the beginning was endearing. So, I though this princess like character was going to be debased into performing her great ballet skills to the hierarchy of mob bosses and powers that be in order to climb the social ladder in a sordid way (like the other side of midnight) in order to gain power over her rivals and reclaim her sanity and self respect after conquering all her villains. That would have seemed more believable than ballet being turned into judo and Kung Fu skills, without any plausible transition, like in the karate kid. Half of the show was very plausible, interesting and respectable, then when she went to prison and the fighting starts, the movie went all down hill. Actually the down hill started when the Slater character just stood by his car trying to plead with the bad guys not to kill him (hardly in character with the  business mogul of his achievements). So you are left with wanting to like the movie but ending up laughing at it for the way it just peters out into stereotypical nothingness. I wanted to buy this movie just based on the grace and beauty of Sofya Skya.

Most think that if they've never heard of the movie playing at the local multi-plex then it can't be any good. I'll grant you that many low budget films might not equal what you find in the latest STAR TREK installment but there are some that offer some quality made offerings. Sure their roots lie in exploitation but that doesn't mean that the entertainment quota isn't intact.Such is the case with ASSASSIN'S RUN. Featuring the perennial straight to DVD star Christian Slater in a supporting role it's a decent action flick that offers up ballet as a martial art. Yes, you read that correctly.Slater stars as American businessman Michael Mason, an entrepreneur in Russia who sees the potential for vast wealth. When some documents come up missing Mason is killed before he can look deeper into just who is trying to ruin his business and take all the money at the same time. Unfortunately ties to the Russian mafia are also in the works and they aren't pleased when they discover the money is missing. The only lead they can find is Mason's wife, prima ballerina Maya (Sofya Skya).Maya and Mason's daughter is taken away and Maya framed for murder. Sent to prison there is little hope to escape and even less that she will ever be released. Even Mason's best friend and partner Roman (Cole Houser) can't seem to get her out. When fellow prisoners try to make her talk and eventually kill her, she decides the only person who can help her is herself.Trapped in the tiniest of cells Maya begins a non-stop workout of ballet moves that she can then apply towards combat. The next encounter she has in the yard with the intent of her demise she pirouettes a few facial kicks and takes out her deadliest foe. Having made one friend she escapes and sets out to find not only her daughter but who killed her husband as well.With only one friend to turn to, someone Mason told her to contact should anything happen, she goes down the path of revenge. Her chances are slim but then again this is an action flick where revenge is the best path taken and almost always succeeds.The movie offers some interesting fight sequences that are not only well choreographed but photographed well too. We don't get the now standard extreme close up fight sequence but have the opportunity to witness the sweeping blows and kicks that Maya comes up with. Could real ballet become a martial art? Doubtful but it makes for a good movie.The acting is higher quality than one would expect in a straight to DVD film. Slater offers a commendable though short performance. He deserves better. Skya shows great potential here and let's hope to see more of her.While this isn't the best movie around you could do much worse. If you're looking for some straight action fare that leaves several lose plotlines lying about then give this one a try.",3,WHO KNEW BALLET WAS A MARTIAL ART?,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,2898,"['Even', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'can', 'look', 'good', 'entertain', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Most', 'think', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'playing', 'local', 'multi-plex', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'many', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'might', 'not', 'equal', 'what', 'find', 'latest', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'installment', 'are', 'offer', 'quality', 'made', 'offerings', 'Sure', 'roots', 'lie', 'exploitation', ""n't"", 'mean', 'entertainment', 'quota', ""n't"", 'intact.Such', 'case', 'ASSASSIN', 'RUN', 'Featuring', 'perennial', 'straight', 'DVD', 'star', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'supporting', 'role', 'decent', 'action', 'flick', 'up', 'ballet', 'martial', 'art', 'Yes', 'read', 'correctly.Slater', 'stars', 'American', 'businessman', 'Michael', 'Mason', 'entrepreneur', 'Russia', 'who', 'potential', 'vast', 'wealth', 'When', 'documents', 'come', 'up', 'missing', 'Mason', 'killed', 'can', 'look', 'deeper', 'just', 'who', 'trying', 'ruin', 'business', 'take', 'money', 'same', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'are', 'also', 'works', 'are', ""n't"", 'pleased', 'when', 'discover', 'money', 'missing', 'only', 'lead', 'can', 'find', 'Mason', 'wife', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'Maya', 'Sofya', 'Skya', '.Maya', 'Mason', 'daughter', 'taken', 'away', 'Maya', 'framed', 'murder', 'Sent', 'prison', 'little', 'hope', 'escape', 'even', 'less', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'Even', 'Mason', 'best', 'friend', 'partner', 'Roman', 'Cole', 'Houser', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'out', 'When', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'try', 'make', 'talk', 'eventually', 'kill', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'herself.Trapped', 'tiniest', 'cells', 'Maya', 'non-stop', 'workout', 'ballet', 'moves', 'can', 'then', 'apply', 'towards', 'combat', 'next', 'encounter', 'yard', 'intent', 'demise', 'few', 'facial', 'kicks', 'out', 'deadliest', 'foe', 'Having', 'made', 'one', 'friend', 'out', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'daughter', 'who', 'killed', 'husband', 'well.With', 'only', 'one', 'friend', 'turn', 'someone', 'Mason', 'told', 'contact', 'should', 'anything', 'happen', 'down', 'path', 'revenge', 'chances', 'are', 'slim', 'then', 'again', 'action', 'flick', 'where', 'revenge', 'best', 'path', 'taken', 'almost', 'always', 'succeeds.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'well', 'choreographed', 'photographed', 'well', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'now', 'standard', 'extreme', 'close', 'up', 'fight', 'sequence', 'have', 'opportunity', 'witness', 'sweeping', 'blows', 'kicks', 'Maya', 'up', 'Could', 'real', 'ballet', 'become', 'martial', 'art', 'Doubtful', 'good', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'higher', 'quality', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'straight', 'DVD', 'film', 'Slater', 'commendable', 'short', 'performance', 'better', 'Skya', 'great', 'potential', 'here', 'let', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'her.While', ""n't"", 'best', 'movie', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'worse', ""'re"", 'looking', 'straight', 'action', 'fare', 'several', 'lose', 'plotlines', 'lying', 'then', 'give', 'one', 'try']",Assassins Run

So, with that in mind, I thought to chance the rental, hoping for the best. Well, that plan hit the trash fairly quickly... but it's not his fault. Christian's on-screen time is modest and he's saddled with a one-dimensional role. That left me with Cole Hauser and the real star of the movie... Sofya Skya.Both actors (Cole and Sofya) delivered good performances with their characters - but whereas Milla Jovovich in the Resident Evil saga was given extraordinary powers by the T Virus, or if you prefer, Angelina Jolie in the Tomb Raider series who engaged in combat training night and day - here, there is no such crutch to help suspend reality for a demure Russian ballerina kicking her way past the Russian Mafia. Admittedly, I found myself liking her character, respecting her sacrifice for the ballet, and identifying with her fears for her life and family - but watching that translate into fighting skills lessened the movie for me. Sure, there is a certain ""fun"" element watching a gorgeous woman kick-ass (pun intended)... and the basic plot is consistent... but it could have been so much more. The Russian roles were the usual stereotypes, the blase attitude of killing for money touched everyone, and the movie should have been extended to wrap up ""loose ends"" rather than providing a memorable line for the sequel. Not sure if they'll pull that off...On the whole, there were aspects of Assassin's Run that I enjoyed... I just found the writing lacking in depth across the board. Perhaps that is what they believe will appeal to audiences these days.
