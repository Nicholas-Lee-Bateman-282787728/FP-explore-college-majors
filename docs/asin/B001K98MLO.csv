1207542,AM9YB0BKXFH7Z,B001K98MLO,"B. Ackley ""jumpstudios""","[1, 2]","Wolf's Rain is a tale set in desolate future where wolves have dwindled in numbers so much that they have learned how to appear as humans to other people. The world in which they live is a brutal place where food is limited, life is hard and there is little to be happy about. The wolves have the idea that they are looking for a moon maiden that will guide them to a wolf paradise.First, the good things. The show is a visual treat to look at. Designed by the same production team behind RahXephon the characters, locations and the images are really quite attractive. Another huge plus is the music. Scored by Yoko Kanno whose credit include ""Cowboy bebop"", ""RahXEphon"" and ""Arjuna"" the music is breathtaking and worth purchasing. The only dud song is the opening theme song ""STRAY"" which does sound like an 80's throwback. Beautiful songs like ""Gravity"", ""Run wolf warrior"" and ""tell me what the rain knows"" are gorgeous moving and really help connect you to the story.Now, the bad stuff. ""Wolf's rain"" does a great job of developing each of the wolves' personalities and we understand each characters motives as they go on their sprawling trip to find paradise. Along the way things get convulted with the introduction of the moon maiden, factions of people with their own agenda and in fighting between the wolves. I won't spoil the ending but I felt like the conclusion to this anime was completely ubsurd. perhaps the writers didn't know how to end the show, or thought the ending they gave it was more ""meaningful"". By the time the series ends I felt chetated of my time and I felt i had invested in characters that were wasted for a stupid ending.being a 26+ episode series this show is a big time investment.

I expected much more from this series than what I got. My friends had me so hyped for it and in the end I was left disappointed.This series has some decent action in it. The storyline starts off about four wolves in a waste land setting trying to find their paradise. They must overcome all sorts of challenges to reach their destination. It consists of scenes with much walking like in The Lord of the Rings, but more boring. The relationship between the characters is strong and there is atleast one character you can relate to.Like I said before this series is not one of my favorites, but it is a solid anime series.

1207548,A32DXRH18Z24ER,B001K98MLO,Joshua Miles,"[8, 10]","I have to say that after having seen a few episodes of this show randomly on Cartoon Network a while back I was skeptical about what it had to offer. But I will say that after watching the whole series through I changed my mind about it. It had a very original story behind it. A post apocalyptic world where wolves are believed to have been hunted to extinction by the Nobles (a ruling class in the world who still remember some of the old science from before the Apocalypse) because of a story that claims that the door to ""Paradise"" will only be found by wolves and once they find paradise the world we know will end. However the wolves are not extinct, they just learned how to make themselves appear human. The story follows Kiba and three other wolves, who follow him for differing reasons, as they make their way out of the city in search of paradise. Along the way there are a few human characters that have big parts in the show as well and they all do the usual human thing of having realizations about the problems that humanity caused or being just plain crazy. All in all I would recommend this to anyone who is either a true anime fan or people who like anime that is specifically about the trials and tribulations of man, since the wolves are usually seen in human form and deal with very human like problems. And if you aren't sure whether you would or wouldn't like this anime I would suggest renting it from netflix or borrowing from someone you know who already has it because I am pretty sure that once you see the show you will buy it.

1207557,A1XMETZBIAWAI9,B001K98MLO,Wrath,"[0, 0]","First of all I have to say that Wolf's Rain is one of my favorite anime series of all time. it has a great and original story, it has a great cast of characters and one of the best soundtracks done by Yoko Kanno (of Cowboy Bebop fame) to address the story itself is kind of moot because I really would hate to spoil it by giving you anything. I watched this series a while back and was blown away, at first being kind of discouraged by the premise, thinking it was original but a bit over the top and stupid but as I watched more of it the characters become far more developed and brought to life in a way that makes the whole wolves storyline not even really matter in the grand scheme of things. In short if you are looking for something deep and involving get this series and watch it.I gave this product a 4 out of 5 not for the show itself which most anime fans already know and love but because of the absolutely horrid packaging. now typically I am not one to care about what the packaging is like, as long as all the episodes are there and they work it's all good. However this packaging is absolutely horrible. The center tab is what really makes this package a polished crap ball.pretty much EVERY time I move the center tab over it pops the second to last disk out of place, I have learned that you have to hold the box a certain way so that the second to last disk won't pop out but it's just annoying. it's not a big deal, I would still recommend this set but just be careful with it so you don't damage the disks.I also think the disks could have used more episodes on them so that you could cut down on just how many disks there are. You could have 9 episodes per disk which would give you 4 disks, 3 with 27 episodes and the final disk with the last 3 episodes and ALL the special features. Granted this particular box set has little to no special features but still it would save disk space and hassle for the company to do it that way.",4,Great Series for a great price,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,1953,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'Wolf', 'Rain', 'one', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'time', 'great', 'original', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'characters', 'one', 'best', 'soundtracks', 'done', 'Yoko', 'Kanno', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'fame', 'address', 'story', 'kind', 'moot', 'really', 'would', 'hate', 'spoil', 'giving', 'anything', 'watched', 'series', 'back', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'first', 'being', 'kind', 'discouraged', 'premise', 'thinking', 'was', 'original', 'bit', 'top', 'stupid', 'watched', 'more', 'characters', 'become', 'far', 'more', 'developed', 'brought', 'life', 'way', 'whole', 'wolves', 'storyline', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'matter', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'short', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'deep', 'involving', 'get', 'series', 'watch', 'it.I', 'gave', 'product', '4', '5', 'not', 'show', 'most', 'anime', 'fans', 'already', 'know', 'love', 'absolutely', 'horrid', 'packaging', 'now', 'typically', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'care', 'what', 'packaging', 'like', 'as', 'long', 'episodes', 'are', 'there', 'work', 'good', 'However', 'packaging', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'center', 'tab', 'what', 'really', 'package', 'polished', 'crap', 'ball.pretty', 'much', 'EVERY', 'time', 'move', 'center', 'tab', 'second', 'last', 'disk', 'place', 'have', 'learned', 'have', 'hold', 'box', 'certain', 'way', 'second', 'last', 'disk', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pop', 'out', 'just', 'annoying', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'set', 'just', 'be', 'careful', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'damage', 'disks.I', 'also', 'think', 'disks', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'episodes', 'so', 'could', 'cut', 'down', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'disks', 'are', 'could', 'have', '9', 'episodes', 'disk', 'would', 'give', '4', 'disks', '3', '27', 'episodes', 'final', 'disk', 'last', '3', 'episodes', 'special', 'features', 'Granted', 'particular', 'box', 'set', 'little', 'special', 'features', 'still', 'would', 'save', 'disk', 'space', 'hassle', 'company', 'do', 'way']",Wolf's Rain Anime Legends Perfect Collection
