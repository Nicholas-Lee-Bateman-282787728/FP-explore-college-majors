603783,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLQT,A Customer,"[7, 12]","Summary:Craig (Ice Cube) and Day-Day (Mike Epps) are cousins that are kind of down on their luck.  As a matter of fact, their luck is so bad that they get robbed by Santa Claus on Christmas Eve; he even takes their rent money they hid in a speaker.  They are supposed to be starting jobs that very day as unarmed security officers at a ghetto ... mall.  They spend the day causing problems and trying to use their new jobs to meet girls.  Eventually they are fired and come up with the idea of having a party that night and charging people to come so they can make enough to pay their rent.  They also have another run in with the thief Santa Claus.  The movie ends with them catching Santa and getting their presents and money back.  But because so much is left unanswered they have to explain what becomes of everyone in the movie using voiced over dialogue at the end.My Comments:It's almost as if this is supposed to be a black version of The Grinch That Stole Christmas; only this version isn't funny and doesn't have any ... lessons to teach.  The acting is really [weak]; I've seen Ice Cube do better.  Women are continuously objectified; ...  The story is disjointed and makes very little sense.I don't really know what else to say about it.  It's supposed to be a comedy, but their potty humor and debasing of women just isn't funny.Overall, perhaps this type of movie appeals to some people, but I'm not one of them.  I seem to recall this movie actually receiving some release attention with commercials on TV.  It definitely didn't deserve the hype it received.

It came out of nowhere and became a decent hit which has grown into cult status in a very short amount of time.  Chris Tucker and Ice Cube were perfectly matched and had a chemistry so palpable which made for a very enjoyable ride.  Then, inexplicably Chris Tucker didn't appear in the sequel ""Next Friday"" (it was probably his choice not to return after the success of Rush Hour) and he was sorely missed.  This second outing in the trilogy was boring beyond belief and, even though I had tried, I couldn't bring myself to like it.Then, I had pretty much given up on the whole Friday thing until a friend of mine recommended that I rent this next installement.  He told me he found it very funny and, not really knowing what to expect, I gave it a try.  I must say my confidence was restored in the Friday potential and, even though this third act is not as great as it could have been, I found myself enjoying it quite a lot.True, I am like most fans of Friday who all wish ""Smokey"" would come back.  Chris Tucker made this role so memorable that everytime we get a new one, most of us secretly hope he'll be around.  Well, no luck here either even though Mike Epps is doing quite a good job and is very funny in this.  John Witherspoon as the father is always hilarious to watch and I found myself captivated by the pimp character, dressed in flamboyant costumes with an attitude to match.  He was probably the best new character in the film in my opinion along with the new big tug around the block involved in a delicious storyline with homoerotic overtones.My one regret about the Friday movies is the fact that Ice Cube doesn't give us the whole family anymore.  What made the first one so enjoyable was the fact that they were all part of the scheme of things but now, we never get to see Craig's sister and his mother is only featured in a small thankless role.  Frankly, she deserves much better.There are some very nice gags and I laughed out loud at many of them.  I must say I don't really care much for the infinifilm gimmick where you see the film as different options to watch the behind the scenes stuff became available all throughout.  I either want to watch the movie without interruption or watch the special features and mixing the two is not my idea of fun.  But maybe that's just me.In conclusion, this third one is a good effort.  It also made me hopeful that the fourth one (I am pretty sure there will be one according to what the actors said in the documentaries) will be even better, if we can finally have the chance to see every member of the family have a bigger part in the story.

603788,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,B00005JLQT,Crazy Jim,"[3, 4]","&quot;Friday After Next&quot; tries to be both a successful addition to the Friday series and an effective &quot;holiday in the hood&quot; movie and by all means, fails at both. Ice Cube reprises his role as both writer and actor for this very dissapointing third installment.Craig and his cousin, Day-Day have moved back to South Central where they work as rent-a-cops at a shopping plaza on Christmas Eve. With their rent money stolen by an evil Santa Claus the night before, they need to come up on some quick cash and fast. With Day-Day's buffonish antics getting the duo in some serious trouble with their equaly-goofy boss who runs a donut shop at the plaza, they may be out of a job before the day ends.&quot;Friday After Next&quot; is such a poor effort at continuing what was once a decent comedy franchise. Cube is just as solid a &quot;straight man&quot; as he was in the first film but his supporting cast has gotten noticeably weaker. Giving Mike Epps more to do and say doesn't help this movie either. Fifteen minutes into it, I was practically begging for Chris Tucker. Terry Crews as the muscle-bound bully plays like a watered-down version of Tiny Lister's &quot;Deebo&quot; with a painfully unfunny and uncreative &quot;prison homsexual&quot; gimmick thrown on. The joke never dies and dramatized scenes of the character raping another male character in the bathroom for the sake of humor are about as low brow as you can get. There are a few funny lines here and there (enough to fit into one of the ads) but all of the absolutetly dumb and stereotypical characters kill what little humor there is. Cube's script is about as uninspired as you get. Did anyone notice there are at least two or three characters who serve the same purpose as one another?&quot;Friday After Next&quot; brings a lot of special features to a movie that in all honesty is not nearly worth the effort. If you are a fan of the Friday trilogy, the DVD may be worth it for the features but your best bet is to act like this movie doesn't exist.

The end resullt is a movie that is okay, but you expected a bit more, kind of like what you expected in Next Friday, a but more. Friday After Next is about Ice Cube and Mike Epps moving back into the hood in an apartment complex. 2 nights before christmas there presents are stolen and they are left with no rent money or presents to give each other (or whoever they were plannin on givin them to.) The robber is a masked Santa Clause who is a person who has been stealing christmas presents from famalies for his own use.When I first heard of the movie, my frirst impression was to see it. However the ""cristmas theme"" brought me to skipping it and watching it on dvd. Too bad that I waited so long and didnt see it till last night cause this movie is not one to sleep on, or skip for that matter. The movie, is for the most part a funny movie. However after watching the first 2 you'd expcet a little more from this franchise, like more laughs and funnier ones at that. There are plenty of laugh from Epps however and creates the humor in the movie. Acting is done very well in the movie.  Epps for example makes you believe that will go crazy if he has some authority. It doesn't seem like he's trying to be funny, it seems like he's exactly like that. The new characters (like the homosexual or Money Mike - the pimp) don't look like there acting, and if they are there doing a reallygood job. The homosexual does seem like he is a homosexual and money mike does have all the aspects to be a pimp. This is something that at the moment makes the movie just that more funny.There are only a few things bad from the movie. One is that Ice Cube seems to not have progressed as an actor since the first movie.Is still the same old Ice cube and all of his moves in ths movie are widely expected. Also the fact that the rest of the family is not recognized during the movie. Sure there are afew scenes containing his family but actors like John Witherspoon deserve a much bigger role in the movie. More lines, and more to do with the plot.All in all Friday After Next is a god movie, not one to pass, but is only worth a rent. 3 stars for the lack of more humor and suppporting roles from the family",3,It was okay,1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,2265,"['Friday', 'Next', 'basically', 'original', 'Friday', 'less', 'laughs', 'end', 'resullt', 'movie', 'okay', 'expected', 'bit', 'more', 'kind', 'what', 'expected', 'Next', 'Friday', 'more', 'Friday', 'Next', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'moving', 'back', 'hood', 'apartment', 'complex', '2', 'nights', 'christmas', 'presents', 'are', 'stolen', 'are', 'left', 'rent', 'money', 'presents', 'give', 'other', 'whoever', 'were', 'plannin', 'givin', 'robber', 'masked', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'who', 'person', 'who', 'been', 'stealing', 'christmas', 'presents', 'famalies', 'own', 'use.When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'frirst', 'impression', 'was', 'see', 'However', 'cristmas', 'theme', 'brought', 'skipping', 'watching', 'dvd', 'Too', 'bad', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'didnt', 'see', 'till', 'last', 'night', 'cause', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'sleep', 'skip', 'matter', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'funny', 'movie', 'However', 'watching', 'first', '2', ""'d"", 'expcet', 'little', 'more', 'franchise', 'more', 'laughs', 'funnier', 'ones', 'are', 'plenty', 'laugh', 'Epps', 'however', 'humor', 'movie', 'Acting', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'Epps', 'example', 'believe', 'will', 'go', 'crazy', 'authority', ""n't"", 'seem', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'exactly', 'new', 'characters', 'homosexual', 'Money', 'Mike', 'pimp', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'there', 'acting', 'are', 'there', 'doing', 'reallygood', 'job', 'homosexual', 'seem', 'homosexual', 'money', 'mike', 'have', 'aspects', 'be', 'pimp', 'something', 'moment', 'movie', 'just', 'more', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'bad', 'movie', 'One', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'not', 'have', 'progressed', 'actor', 'first', 'movie.Is', 'still', 'same', 'old', 'Ice', 'cube', 'moves', 'ths', 'movie', 'are', 'widely', 'expected', 'Also', 'fact', 'rest', 'family', 'not', 'recognized', 'movie', 'Sure', 'are', 'afew', 'scenes', 'containing', 'family', 'actors', 'John', 'Witherspoon', 'deserve', 'much', 'bigger', 'role', 'movie', 'More', 'lines', 'more', 'do', 'plot.All', 'Friday', 'Next', 'god', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'pass', 'only', 'worth', 'rent', '3', 'stars', 'lack', 'more', 'humor', 'suppporting', 'roles', 'family']",Friday After Next

The next day, they call the police, and while the cops are trying to slove the crime, Craig and Day-Day go off to their new jobs as mall security guards, which Day-Day of course takes very seriously. Knowing they have to pay off their apartment money collector, they work extra hard to get the money they would've had if Santa didn't take it along with the gifts. And if they don't, they have to see Damon, who later on in the movie gets the hots for Money Mike...This is a good movie, and I'd see it if you enjoy stupid comedies, even if you aren't an Ice Cube fan (as I said before, I'm not).",4,Great!,1040169600,"12 18, 2002",2002,1510,"['Ok-I', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'Friday', 'plan', 'soon', 'saw', 'Next', 'Friday', 'enjoyed', 'saw', 'had', 'more', 'laughs', 'then', 'Next', 'Friday', 'not', 'interesting', 'plot', 'who', 'Friday', 'movie', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'not', 'rap', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'far', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Barbershop', 'Next', 'Friday', 'great', 'actor', 'obviously', 'very', 'talented', 'wrote', 'produced', 'movie', 'came', 'up', 'Money', 'Mike', 'brilliant', 'know', 'Money', 'Mike', 'PIMP', 'One', 'few', 'new', 'characters', 'movie', 'almost', 'show', 'definely', 'most', 'funny.The', 'movie', 'place', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'hood', 'Craig', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Day-Day', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'are', 'napping', 'thief', 'dressed', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'breaks', 'steals', 'Christmas', 'gifts', 'Craig', 'wakes', 'tries', 'stop', 'Day-Day', 'dreaming', 'fat', 'next', 'day', 'call', 'police', 'cops', 'are', 'trying', 'slove', 'crime', 'Craig', 'Day-Day', 'go', 'new', 'jobs', 'mall', 'security', 'guards', 'Day-Day', 'course', 'very', 'seriously', 'Knowing', 'have', 'pay', 'off', 'apartment', 'money', 'collector', 'work', 'extra', 'hard', 'get', 'money', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Santa', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'along', 'gifts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'Damon', 'who', 'later', 'movie', 'hots', 'Money', 'Mike', 'good', 'movie', ""'d"", 'see', 'enjoy', 'stupid', 'comedies', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'Ice', 'Cube', 'fan', 'said', ""'m"", 'not']",Friday After Next

Mattocks,"[0, 3]","Eventhough I haven't seen Friday After Next because of some bad publicity and negative comments which led me initially not to watch Next Friday.  Comedy sequels always are not as good as the originals.  The original Friday no doubt is one of the top ten comedies of all time, period.  But I think because Chris Tucker didn't come back for Next Friday, people automatically assumed or thought that it wasn't as funny.  Well, after looking at the movie for what it was, a different story line and movie from the originally Friday, Next Friday in all honesty was just as hilarious.  Donald ""DC"" Curry (Cubes Uncle Elroy) and Mike Epps (Day-Day) added a different twist to the Friday story and those two were hilarious as hell.  Then throw in the drug smugglin ""Essays"" next door and of course Debo and his brother stalking Ice Cube throughout, Next Friday turned out to be a really funny movie.  It definitely isn't as funny as the original Friday, then again, what comedy sequel is as good as the original (Okay, American Pie 2 may get my vote for that).  So I will take the same approach for Friday After Next when it comes out on DVD.  I'll watch it as if there were no prequels and judge it based on that.  People should stop dissing Next Friday cuz it was hilarious without having to bite too much from the original movie.

603817,ABE14SVILZLNY,B00005JLQT,"SID ""Punk""","[2, 4]","1995's `Friday' was a laid back, pot-smoking comedy that felt like a long summer day with nothing to do. 2000's `Next Friday,' upped the pace and changed the focus, but still remained a leisurely affair. The new `Friday After Next,' is something else entirely - if they ever need a cure for narcolepsy, this is the film to study. An aggressively paced, rowdy sequel that never, ever stops, `Friday After Next' takes the series in an entirely new direction: out of control.Back in the hood after spending some time with his Uncle Elroy (Don `DC' Curry) in the suburbs, Craig (Ice Cube), and his cousin Day Day (Mike Epps), are suffering through a lousy Christmas holiday when their presents and rent money are stolen by a robber dressed as Santa. Forced back into the working world, the two get jobs as security men at a local strip mall. `Friday After Next' details Craig and Day Day's first Friday on the job, as they dodge an evil landlord (Bebe Drake), disrupt holiday carols from some old ladies, meet gorgeous women (including K.D. Aubert), thwart some crackhead shoplifters, get yelled at by their middle-eastern boss (Maz Jobrani), and plan a party that will bring holiday cheer to all.I must give credit to writer/producer/star Ice Cube for taking the sporadically funny, message-minded comedy in `Friday,' and turning it into the viable comedic franchise that it is today. `Next Friday' was a such a marked improvement over the original, that hopes were high for Cube to top himself with this new installment. But while Cube did up the ante here, he upped it in all the wrong places. Like a bat out of hell, `Friday After Next' is such a cyclone of jokes, characters, situations, and general visual nonsense, that one needs a seat belt and current physical just to keep up. It's rather insane how fast this movie flows, not just in pace, but also in material to handle. Cube has thrown everything he could into this production, and without much of an attempt to sort it all out, this new `Friday' isn't quite as successful as the last one.That's not to say there isn't fun to be had. I enjoy how Cube writes all the action for one location, and then allows the insanity to build throughout the day. His ear for urban silliness is just as eagerly welcomed. But `Friday After Next' simply gets away from him, spinning deliriously through prison sex jokes, female facial hair gags, holiday trimmings, L.A.P.D. razzings (one officer's badge name simply reads `A. Hole'), returning characters from `Next Friday,' Cube and Epps's own shockingly limp interplay, and landing at the climactic party where the comedy explodes like a bomb sending little bits of funny shrapnel everywhere. I laughed a lot at `Friday After Next,' but I spent as much time wondering where the brakes were on this thing.The golden goose of `Next Friday' was the introduction of comedian Mike Epps. In replacing the monotonous Chris Tucker as Cube's sidekick, Epps infused the `Friday' series with a new playfulness, and a willingness to get a little silly for the laughs. Epps was comic perfection in `Next Friday' (as he was in his other Cube collaboration, `All About The Benjamins'), but `Friday After Next' plays at such an obscenely high pitch, that it drowns out what Epps has to offer. He resorts to yelling just to be heard. Thankfully, to help Epps out, there is hilarious supporting work from Katt Micah Williams at Money Mike, a Prince-lookalike, high maintenance pimp, Terry Crews as sexually liberated parolee Damon (who has his eye, and other body parts, on Money Mike), and the always reliable John Witherspoon as Craig's intestinally-challenged father. As much as I wanted to enjoy Epps this time around, he just isn't a match for the sheer velocity of this chapter.I doubt any hardcore fans of `Friday' will recognize their beloved film in this second sequel. And while there are enough laughs to go around, I think someone needs to drop a sedative in Ice Cube's coffee before we're subjected to a potentially strobe-like `Friday After Friday After Next.",4,Friday After Next,1038441600,"11 28, 2002",2002,4049,"['1995', 'Friday', 'was', 'laid', 'back', 'pot-smoking', 'comedy', 'felt', 'long', 'summer', 'day', 'nothing', 'do', '2000', 'Next', 'Friday', 'upped', 'pace', 'changed', 'focus', 'still', 'remained', 'leisurely', 'affair', 'new', 'Friday', 'Next', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'ever', 'need', 'cure', 'narcolepsy', 'film', 'study', 'aggressively', 'paced', 'rowdy', 'sequel', 'never', 'ever', 'Friday', 'Next', 'series', 'entirely', 'new', 'direction', 'control.Back', 'hood', 'spending', 'time', 'Uncle', 'Elroy', 'Don', 'DC', 'Curry', 'suburbs', 'Craig', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'cousin', 'Day', 'Day', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'are', 'suffering', 'lousy', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'when', 'presents', 'rent', 'money', 'are', 'stolen', 'robber', 'dressed', 'Santa', 'Forced', 'back', 'working', 'world', 'two', 'get', 'jobs', 'security', 'men', 'local', 'strip', 'mall', 'Friday', 'Next', 'details', 'Craig', 'Day', 'Day', 'first', 'Friday', 'job', 'dodge', 'evil', 'landlord', 'Bebe', 'Drake', 'disrupt', 'holiday', 'carols', 'old', 'ladies', 'meet', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'including', 'K.D', 'Aubert', 'thwart', 'crackhead', 'shoplifters', 'get', 'yelled', 'middle-eastern', 'boss', 'Maz', 'Jobrani', 'plan', 'party', 'will', 'bring', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'all.I', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'writer/producer/star', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'taking', 'sporadically', 'funny', 'message-minded', 'comedy', 'Friday', 'turning', 'viable', 'comedic', 'franchise', 'today', 'Next', 'Friday', 'was', 'such', 'marked', 'improvement', 'original', 'hopes', 'were', 'high', 'Cube', 'top', 'new', 'installment', 'Cube', 'did', 'up', 'ante', 'here', 'upped', 'wrong', 'places', 'bat', 'hell', 'Friday', 'Next', 'such', 'cyclone', 'jokes', 'characters', 'situations', 'general', 'visual', 'nonsense', 'one', 'seat', 'belt', 'current', 'physical', 'just', 'keep', 'up', 'rather', 'insane', 'how', 'fast', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'pace', 'also', 'material', 'handle', 'Cube', 'thrown', 'everything', 'could', 'production', 'much', 'attempt', 'sort', 'out', 'new', 'Friday', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'successful', 'last', 'one.That', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'enjoy', 'how', 'Cube', 'action', 'one', 'location', 'then', 'insanity', 'build', 'day', 'ear', 'urban', 'silliness', 'just', 'eagerly', 'welcomed', 'Friday', 'Next', 'simply', 'away', 'spinning', 'deliriously', 'prison', 'sex', 'jokes', 'female', 'facial', 'hair', 'gags', 'holiday', 'trimmings', 'L.A.P.D', 'razzings', 'one', 'officer', 'badge', 'name', 'simply', 'A.', 'Hole', 'returning', 'characters', 'Next', 'Friday', 'Cube', 'Epps', 'own', 'shockingly', 'limp', 'interplay', 'landing', 'climactic', 'party', 'where', 'comedy', 'explodes', 'bomb', 'sending', 'little', 'bits', 'funny', 'shrapnel', 'everywhere', 'laughed', 'lot', 'Friday', 'Next', 'spent', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'wondering', 'where', 'brakes', 'were', 'thing.The', 'golden', 'goose', 'Next', 'Friday', 'was', 'introduction', 'comedian', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'replacing', 'monotonous', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'Cube', 'sidekick', 'Epps', 'infused', 'Friday', 'series', 'new', 'playfulness', 'willingness', 'get', 'little', 'silly', 'laughs', 'Epps', 'was', 'comic', 'perfection', 'Next', 'Friday', 'was', 'other', 'Cube', 'collaboration', 'Benjamins', 'Friday', 'Next', 'plays', 'obscenely', 'high', 'pitch', 'out', 'what', 'Epps', 'offer', 'yelling', 'just', 'be', 'heard', 'Thankfully', 'help', 'Epps', 'out', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'work', 'Katt', 'Micah', 'Williams', 'Money', 'Mike', 'Prince-lookalike', 'high', 'maintenance', 'pimp', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'sexually', 'liberated', 'parolee', 'Damon', 'who', 'eye', 'other', 'body', 'parts', 'Money', 'Mike', 'always', 'reliable', 'John', 'Witherspoon', 'Craig', 'intestinally-challenged', 'father', 'As', 'much', 'wanted', 'enjoy', 'Epps', 'time', 'around', 'just', ""n't"", 'match', 'sheer', 'velocity', 'chapter.I', 'doubt', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'Friday', 'will', 'recognize', 'beloved', 'film', 'second', 'sequel', 'are', 'enough', 'laughs', 'go', 'think', 'someone', 'needs', 'drop', 'sedative', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'coffee', ""'re"", 'subjected', 'potentially', 'strobe-like', 'Friday', 'Friday', 'Next']",Friday After Next
