I have purchased so many Korean dramas, that I guess I am spoiled by the quality and substance of the acting and the locations. Koreans seem to spare nothing. The acting is so very realistic. The stories, even if they are comedy more than drama, have such a great story, they seem realistic. They are not tasteless and tacky as American TV has become. I am 70 years old. I have learned more in the last year about the Korean people than I have in my entire life. For some reason it was time for me to find out about them. Why are they divided. That is such a tragedy. Without interference from outside countries, the USA included, would they not do better? I was shocked to learn Theodore Roosevelt gave Korea to Japan. I had never learned that in history. I recommend more people watch and learn. Watch the historical dramas. What an amazing country Korea is. What strong wonderful people live there. I purchased this from Amazon.

996648,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000FUZY38,Ernest Jagger,"[13, 17]","Having just watched this film, ""Shadlowless Sword,"" after viewing ""Seven Swords,"" with Donnie Yen, I was almost tempted to give this film 5 stars. I bought this film almost one year ago, and finally got around to watching it. I think this film could have been better, especially if the comic elements in the film were taken out, however, this is the way the film is presented so I will have to live with it. Also, the film really has no plot, but then that does not necesarily mean it won't be a fun film. Which is what this film is meant to be: Entertaining and fun! Also, one of the things I like about films is character development, and there is none in this film. Having written this, however, I do think the film will appeal to some viewers of this genre.Further, I found the film entertaining and visually stunning. And although the action scenes in the film were okay, they were not as good as some of the ones I have seen from Hong Kong martial arts films. The main thing for me, however, is that I really wish that the films from Korea and HK, were more serious in their nature. I think that the Jackie Chan style of comical acting needs a makeover: especially since so many of the films [and this one in particular] are so beautiful in their visual effects. The costumes are great, they just need a little more seriousness, that's all.Therefore, for me I would like to see more seriousness in Korean action scenes. I liked ""House of Flying Daggers,"" and ""Hero"" even though they stretched realism in their combat scenes. But I really believe that Korean films need to distance themselves from HK films, because they can be truly masterful if realism was placed in their action films. The flowery combat of the wuxia style from the aforementioned films were good, but now I would like to see some real gritty realism that one finds in Japanese cinema. I really liked ""Shinobi,"" and ""Azumi 1&2."" And even though they were Japanese films which stretched the limits of believability, this was an abberation, and not the norm. Which is why I probably liked them so much. Anyway, I recommend the film. Rent it first [If it is still available].",3,Fun And Entertaining Korean Film: Great Eye Candy!,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,2147,"['Having', 'just', 'watched', 'film', 'Shadlowless', 'Sword', 'viewing', 'Seven', 'Swords', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'was', 'almost', 'tempted', 'give', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'bought', 'film', 'almost', 'one', 'year', 'ago', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'think', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'especially', 'comic', 'elements', 'film', 'were', 'taken', 'out', 'however', 'way', 'film', 'presented', 'so', 'will', 'have', 'live', 'Also', 'film', 'really', 'plot', 'then', 'not', 'necesarily', 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'fun', 'film', 'Which', 'what', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'Entertaining', 'fun', 'Also', 'one', 'things', 'like', 'films', 'character', 'development', 'none', 'film', 'Having', 'written', 'however', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'genre.Further', 'found', 'film', 'entertaining', 'visually', 'stunning', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'were', 'okay', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'main', 'thing', 'however', 'really', 'wish', 'films', 'Korea', 'HK', 'were', 'more', 'serious', 'nature', 'think', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'style', 'comical', 'acting', 'makeover', 'especially', 'so', 'many', 'films', '[', 'one', 'particular', ']', 'are', 'so', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'effects', 'costumes', 'are', 'great', 'just', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'seriousness', 'all.Therefore', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'seriousness', 'Korean', 'action', 'scenes', 'liked', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'Hero', 'even', 'stretched', 'realism', 'combat', 'scenes', 'really', 'believe', 'Korean', 'films', 'need', 'distance', 'HK', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'truly', 'masterful', 'realism', 'was', 'placed', 'action', 'films', 'flowery', 'combat', 'wuxia', 'style', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'were', 'good', 'now', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'real', 'gritty', 'realism', 'one', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'really', 'liked', 'Shinobi', 'Azumi', '1', '2', 'even', 'were', 'Japanese', 'films', 'stretched', 'limits', 'believability', 'was', 'abberation', 'not', 'norm', 'Which', 'why', 'probably', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'Anyway', 'recommend', 'film', 'Rent', 'first', 'still', 'available', ']']",Shadowless Sword

The story is basically just like King Ralph, except Peter O' Toole has to protect John Goodman from assassins before he can get back to Buckingham Palace and install a bowling alley in the royal bedchamber.  Ok, so it's a little different than that.  But it is an 'escort the VIP' movie.SS is from the same director that gave us Bichunoo, another fantastic film. It has a great cast from films like ""Guns and Talks"" and ""Arahan"".  SS is a swordplay epic.  For the laymen, it would be in the same vein of a Crouching Tiger or a Hero or House of Flying Daggers.  Period piece, acrobatic wire-fu, lots of swordplay.  And while it may not have the budget, star power, and exposure of the previously mentioned films, it can absolutely hold its own against them.The acting is spot on.  The story, while not anything new, is still very engaging.  And the action is certainly well worth the watch.  Although not quite as graceful as some of it's HK counterparts, the wire work is creative and integrated well into the sequences.  The visual approach is stylish without being over-the-top.  And it does have a great score, too.Fans of asian swordplay movies would be wise to give this one a look.  It doesn't have the depth of story and character that those looking for something more in the drama category are looking for.  And while the action is great, it's not wild and insane like a Kitamura movie or a Hark film, and certainly not as blood-filled.  The action sequences would be considered reserved compared to how those guys work.  So if you're looking for a good, solid swordplay epic that is subtle and understated while being quite entertaining and action-oriented, this would be a fine choice.",4,4 1/2 stars- Top-notch swordplay epic,1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,1848,"['Shadowless', 'Sword', 'great', 'entry', 'Korea', 'country', 'spent', 'new', 'millennium', 'really', 'carving', 'out', 'place', 'asian', 'film', 'world', 'story', 'basically', 'just', 'King', 'Ralph', 'Peter', 'O', 'Toole', 'protect', 'John', 'Goodman', 'assassins', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'install', 'bowling', 'alley', 'royal', 'bedchamber', 'Ok', 'little', 'different', 'VIP', 'movie.SS', 'same', 'director', 'gave', 'Bichunoo', 'fantastic', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'films', 'Guns', 'Talks', 'Arahan', 'SS', 'swordplay', 'epic', 'laymen', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'vein', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hero', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'Period', 'piece', 'acrobatic', 'wire-fu', 'lots', 'swordplay', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'star', 'power', 'exposure', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'films', 'can', 'absolutely', 'hold', 'own', 'them.The', 'acting', 'spot', 'story', 'not', 'anything', 'new', 'still', 'very', 'engaging', 'action', 'certainly', 'well', 'watch', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'graceful', 'HK', 'counterparts', 'wire', 'work', 'creative', 'integrated', 'well', 'sequences', 'visual', 'approach', 'stylish', 'being', 'over-the-top', 'have', 'great', 'score', 'too.Fans', 'asian', 'swordplay', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'wise', 'give', 'one', 'look', ""n't"", 'have', 'depth', 'story', 'character', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'drama', 'category', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'great', 'not', 'wild', 'insane', 'Kitamura', 'movie', 'Hark', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'blood-filled', 'action', 'sequences', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'reserved', 'compared', 'how', 'guys', 'work', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'solid', 'swordplay', 'epic', 'subtle', 'understated', 'being', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'action-oriented', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'choice']",Shadowless Sword

I also liked the ""Killer Blade Army."" It's obvious that a lot of thought was put into this film, not only with the names but the way the movie was shot as well. I thought, however, the story was a bit weak and rather cliche for this genre, and I was disappointed with the introduction of the ""love story"" about mid-way through the film. And I also didn't find it very convincing. Plus, I don't like people flying around through forest trees, nor do I think it was necessary in this film. The strength of the film was the legend of the sword, and the way the sword-fighting scenes were shot was pretty cool. But why does it make sense to have people flying around? If the sword possesses certain powers and gives you certain powers, I can understand the extraordinary things that happen during fighting with the sword. But how is it exactly that the sword can make you fly? Not getting that one! And if the sword possessed the power to make you fly, why is it that your entire army of scrubs can also fly?! I understand that in Chinese martial arts films that this is sort of a magical realism, like a fairy tale of sorts, so perhaps it is similar in Korean martial arts films, or the producer/director decided to borrow from the Chinese style, but frankly it was distracting in this film and quite unnecessary I thought.Those reservations aside, this is still probably the most entertaining of this type of film I've seen since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000) or ""House of Flying Daggers"" (2004).

996665,A34TI9P66QGT0N,B000FUZY38,SB,"[6, 9]","I agree with other reviewers that this was a Korean attempt to make an epic fantasy like Hero, or Crouching Tiger.  Where I disagree is in the rating of its success.  This movie certainly featured lush sets, perfect costuming, and lovely cinematography.  Unfortunately, the rest of the elements didn't rise to the same level.First, the acting, especially of the two leads, was simply stiff and uninspired.  While the female star was certainly beautiful, she lacked the charisma of, say, Brigitte Lin or Michelle Yeoh, for example. One look at any of the work of those two ladies is enough to throw into sharp relief the wooden quality on display here.  For a supposedly determined and passionate warrior, she barely mustered a show of either emotion, or any other, for that matter.As for the hero, he was completely devoid of charm, and didn't succeed at portraying his character as either the rogue prince slumming as an thief/art dealer or the re-inspired leader of his nation.  His blank face and monotone delivery sucked the life out of any interest his character was supposed to have.It was strange that the actors were so bad at acting- because they sure weren't chosen for their martial arts skills, which were non-existent.  Doubles were employed at every opportunity, and transparently so.Regarding the action, it was faux Hong Kong poorly done.  That is, the action scenes were inventively conceived and planned, but horribly executed, with incessant cutting and close-ups that were obviously designed to compensate for the total lack of skills on the part of the actors.  The use of doubles was painfully apparent.  Not only that, even when the doubles were playing, hardly a move was ever shown without a flurry of cuts that robbed the scenes of coherence, and deadened the ""wow"" factor that such scenes are meant to create.  A couple of ridiculously bad moments (such as an embarrassing underwater fight scene) also served to undermine the project.The film also suffered from poor pacing.  This was ostensibly a chase film, but I rarely felt any particular suspense or tension.  A repetitive and dull musical score topped it all off with another layer of ho-hum.I really wanted to like this movie.  I'm a huge fan of HK-style martial arts films, and can't get enough of movies like Once Upon a Time in China, or Ip Man, for example.

996668,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000FUZY38,trashcanman,"[40, 41]","""The Legend of the Shadowless Sword"" would be considered among the greatest wuxia epics of our time but for one little detail: the world has already experienced the unspeakable brilliance of films likeHeroandCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  And make no mistake, this film is Korea's attempt to duplicate the success of these modern classics both artistically and financially.  The result is an almost-great film steeped in female empowerment, classic martial-arts philosophy, and Korean history that only missed classic status by a decade or so.First off, let me say that the leading ladies of ""Shadowless"" are amazing.  Yun So-i is brilliant as Soha, a female warrior tasked with bringing an exiled prince back home after an organization known as The Killer Blade Army murders the entirety of the royal family, leaving him as the only successor to the throne.  Soha and the prince, Jeong-Heyon (played by Lee Seo-jin) who is also quite the fighter, are tracked and ambushed by the Killer Blades led by a seriously vamped-out lady killer. The confrontations between the opposing sword-wielding visions of beauty provide some seriously exciting duels that are on par with the best of the genre.The heart of the story largely focuses on the classical myth/philosophy of Asian swordplay that each blade has within it an evil spirit that gathers strength as it drinks human blood.  This spirit is said to be able to envelope and consume it's user once it gathers enough strength through death and suffering.  This is a fantastic metaphor for the effect taking a life has on a person's being.  What better way to kill one's own soul than by slaughtering so many as to becomes altogether indifferent to suffering?  This is the essence of evil.  Soho's philosophy -bequeathed to her at a young age by a passing hero- is that if the sword is taken up only to protect that which is precious and not to do harm that the shade within will gain no power from the act of killing.  Thus, a righteous warrior has a shadowless sword.The coolest thing about ""Shadowless"" is arguably the costumes.  Every scene features some of the most visually interesting outfits and uniforms I've ever seen in this kind of film.  Big thumbs up on that. The movie itself looks wonderful and very polished, though many of the scenes feel like retreads of previous wuxia films.  There is an interesting underwater battle that could have been brilliant if not for the ridiculous sight of dozens of ninjas sailing over the river throwing hundreds of shurikens into the water for several minutes on end.  How many of those things do they keep on them at one time anyways?  There are some other over-the-top moments that may make one think ofFist of the North Starand the delayed explosions that resulted from the combat in that classic anime cheesefest.  But timed detonations somehow make even less sense when they are inflicted by a sword.  What, chopping a guy's head off or bisecting him at the waist or even vertically isn't good enough anymore?  These are a few of the problems that keep ""The Legend of the Shadowless Sword"" out of the same league as the modern works of art it emulates.  The love story is unconvincing after having seen the incredible beauty ofHouse of Flying Daggers, and the fights -while highly entertaining- are simply not as good as those in ""Crouching Tiger"".In spite of it's few flaws, I would qualify ""The Legend of the Shadowless Sword"" as a must-see for fans of martial-arts or Asian cinema in general.  This one won't enjoy the crossover appeal of the movies I name-checked earlier, but it should thoroughly satisfy fans of the wuxia genre.

A neat feature is that the warrior is a gorgeous young woman (plenty able to kick gluteals, though), and the prince looks like a slacker. He does OK in his secret identity as fence for stolen goods in some back province, but is that who you want on the throne? That's just the start, though, it gets better - partly when an ill-starred romance develops between prince and commoner.This features plenty of well-choreographed swordfights, including a few with the equally capable woman on the opposition team. The look of this movie really stands out, though. We couldn't figure out what part of China this might have been placed in. Names sounded different from the more familiar Chinese ones, closer to Thailand, maybe? Then, a few scenes looked more like Silk Road somewhere, possibly towards Tibet - neither of us knows Chinese social geography well enough to be sure. Still, the unusual look of this movie makes it stand out from the pack.

996671,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000FUZY38,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[23, 23]","Shadowless Sword is the second film effort by the director of Bichunmoo. In my opinion, it may have surpassed the first film or at least equal to it.This film revolves around the story of 2 feuding noble families, the House of Bael has been on the receiving end of violent attacks by the Killer Blade army. Almost all of the Royal Family have murdered by the leader of the Killer Blade army, except one. A prince who went into hiding because he believed himself unworthy of royalty because he felt like there is nothing that can be done of the strife in his country. It is up to a female warrior called Soha to convince him to lay his claim upon the throne. Which it turns out harder than it seems that the remaining heir does not want to become King. The prince served in his father's military and there is a link/bond between the prince and his female protector. The villain is evil enough that audinces can dispise him at the same time pity him, yes, even the villain has his own ""justified motivation"". The action starts when the bad guys start pursuing the good guys.The action is impressive. as in most korean martial arts films, it has an influence of Crouching tiger Hidden Dragon, but believe me when I say it can stand on its own. The swordfights are well choreographed, Woon So-yi (from Arahan)can move as gracefully as any ballerina. The underwater scenes are well-shot and the sword fighting is well-paced. Unlike other Korean action films like Natural City, there is hardly any slow-mo.I'm not sure what they are selling in amazon, but it is probably a Malaysian/Taiwan copy. Just be careful, the quality of these dvds sometimes is not as good as the original imported ones, which is why they are cheap. Sometimes they may freeze a scene when played in most stand alone dvd players. I think these discs only try to fool the player so it can be played. The dvd I have is the 2 disc region 3 version with DTS audio. Since New Line Cinema invested in this Korean flick, I'm pretty sure there will be a region 1 version.Shadowless Sword is a very good film if you enjoyed HERO, AZUMI and SHINOBI. However, as with Shinobi and Azumi the imported region 3 versions are phenomenal, the video/audio quality far surpasses the ones made from Taiwan/Malaysia. Try to get the originals if you can play them on your players, if not, just don't miss this film.RECOMMENDED!!",4,Best Korean epic I've seen so far...,1155772800,"08 17, 2006",2006,2373,"['Shadowless', 'Sword', 'second', 'film', 'effort', 'director', 'Bichunmoo', 'opinion', 'may', 'have', 'surpassed', 'first', 'film', 'least', 'equal', 'it.This', 'film', 'revolves', 'story', '2', 'feuding', 'noble', 'families', 'House', 'Bael', 'been', 'receiving', 'end', 'violent', 'attacks', 'Killer', 'Blade', 'army', 'Almost', 'Royal', 'Family', 'have', 'murdered', 'leader', 'Killer', 'Blade', 'army', 'one', 'prince', 'who', 'went', 'hiding', 'believed', 'unworthy', 'royalty', 'felt', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'strife', 'country', 'up', 'female', 'warrior', 'called', 'Soha', 'convince', 'lay', 'claim', 'throne', 'out', 'harder', 'remaining', 'heir', 'not', 'want', 'become', 'King', 'prince', 'served', 'father', 'military', 'link/bond', 'prince', 'female', 'protector', 'villain', 'evil', 'enough', 'audinces', 'can', 'dispise', 'same', 'time', 'pity', 'yes', 'even', 'villain', 'own', 'justified', 'motivation', 'action', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'start', 'pursuing', 'good', 'guys.The', 'action', 'impressive', 'most', 'korean', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'influence', 'Crouching', 'tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'swordfights', 'are', 'well', 'choreographed', 'Woon', 'So-yi', 'Arahan', 'can', 'move', 'as', 'gracefully', 'ballerina', 'underwater', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-shot', 'sword', 'fighting', 'well-paced', 'other', 'Korean', 'action', 'films', 'Natural', 'City', 'hardly', 'slow-mo.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'are', 'selling', 'amazon', 'probably', 'Malaysian/Taiwan', 'copy', 'Just', 'be', 'careful', 'quality', 'dvds', 'sometimes', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'imported', 'ones', 'why', 'are', 'cheap', 'Sometimes', 'may', 'freeze', 'scene', 'when', 'played', 'most', 'stand', 'alone', 'dvd', 'players', 'think', 'discs', 'only', 'try', 'fool', 'player', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'dvd', 'have', '2', 'disc', 'region', '3', 'version', 'DTS', 'audio', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'invested', 'Korean', 'flick', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'region', '1', 'version.Shadowless', 'Sword', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'HERO', 'AZUMI', 'SHINOBI', 'However', 'Shinobi', 'Azumi', 'imported', 'region', '3', 'versions', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'video/audio', 'quality', 'far', 'ones', 'made', 'Taiwan/Malaysia', 'Try', 'get', 'originals', 'can', 'play', 'players', 'not', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'film.RECOMMENDED']",Shadowless Sword
