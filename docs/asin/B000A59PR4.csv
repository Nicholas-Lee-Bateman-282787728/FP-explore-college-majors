922017,A1VDA6GS3N714H,B000A59PR4,"Guy Denutte ""A concerned citizen""","[1, 2]","Two activists campaigning against McDonald's by distributing pamphlets on the streets had their small grassroots group infiltrated by up to seven spies, paid by McDonald's.  Finally they were sued and asked for apologies.  They stood up for what they believed in, and didn't want to apologize.A Libel court followed, in which big corporations always have had significant advantages : a jury was not allowed, court procedures were secret and legal assistance to the two activists, Helen Steel and Dave Morris, was not provided.  Happily, a bunch of volunteers showed up to help them.  They defended themselves against the best lawyers money can pay.  It would end up in the longest trial in British history !  Two and a half years.It is important to know money can't always buy lies.  For the judge, the arguments in the original pamphlet against McDonald's was sufficiently proven in seven points :* deceptive ads* exploiting children* paying low wages* being anti-union* animal cruelty* bad working conditions* fast food causing heart diseases.Other four points were not sufficiently proven by the activists.  However, considering those two heroes fighting McDonald's with a mere 30.000 pounds - provided by sympathizers - against the 10 million pounds McDonald's put into their defense, this is an incredible victory anyway.Furthermore, since the rights of the defense were not at all respected, the activists took their case a step further and went to the European Court of Human Rights, where it was acknowledged that they had their human rights and their freedom of speech violated !Free Speech vs. McDonald's : 2-0.This is an important movie, since it shows Big Corporations can be defeated by ordinary citizens, like you and me, when we stand up for the truth !",5,Big Corporations can be defeated by the people !,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,1768,"['Two', 'activists', 'campaigning', 'McDonald', 'distributing', 'pamphlets', 'streets', 'had', 'small', 'grassroots', 'group', 'infiltrated', 'seven', 'spies', 'paid', 'McDonald', 'Finally', 'were', 'sued', 'asked', 'apologies', 'stood', 'up', 'what', 'believed', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'apologize.A', 'Libel', 'court', 'followed', 'big', 'corporations', 'always', 'have', 'had', 'significant', 'advantages', 'jury', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'court', 'procedures', 'were', 'secret', 'legal', 'assistance', 'two', 'activists', 'Helen', 'Steel', 'Dave', 'Morris', 'was', 'not', 'provided', 'Happily', 'bunch', 'volunteers', 'showed', 'help', 'defended', 'best', 'lawyers', 'money', 'can', 'pay', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'longest', 'trial', 'British', 'history', 'Two', 'half', 'years.It', 'important', 'know', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'buy', 'lies', 'judge', 'arguments', 'original', 'pamphlet', 'McDonald', 'was', 'sufficiently', 'proven', 'seven', 'points', '*', 'deceptive', 'ads*', 'exploiting', 'children*', 'paying', 'low', 'wages*', 'being', 'anti-union*', 'animal', 'cruelty*', 'bad', 'working', 'conditions*', 'fast', 'food', 'causing', 'heart', 'diseases.Other', 'four', 'points', 'were', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'proven', 'activists', 'However', 'considering', 'two', 'heroes', 'fighting', 'McDonald', 'mere', '30.000', 'pounds', 'provided', 'sympathizers', '10', 'million', 'pounds', 'McDonald', 'put', 'defense', 'incredible', 'victory', 'anyway.Furthermore', 'rights', 'defense', 'were', 'not', 'respected', 'activists', 'took', 'case', 'step', 'further', 'went', 'European', 'Court', 'Human', 'Rights', 'where', 'was', 'acknowledged', 'had', 'human', 'rights', 'freedom', 'speech', 'violated', 'Free', 'Speech', 'vs.', 'McDonald', '2-0.This', 'important', 'movie', 'Big', 'Corporations', 'can', 'be', 'defeated', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'when', 'stand', 'up', 'truth']",McLibel

Fulton,"[6, 6]","The film starts out in Star Wars fashion with the text: ""A long time ago there was a company that made lots of money by selling bits of meat between two bits of bread. Many people were employed to put the meat between the bread and many animals were killed to be the meat. A friendly clown persuaded children to love the company. Some decades passed and all was well. The company became very, very rich. Richer even than many countries. And then some people wrote in their newspapers than eating lots of the meat and bread could make people ill. Other people said on television that too many trees had been cut down and that the workers were unhappy. This made the company very angry. The company looked around the world and saw that in England there was a special law that could stop people saying things the company didn't like. And make them say sorry.""This documentary is about a famous court case involving two activists and the McDonalds corporation in the UK.

922022,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B000A59PR4,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[7, 10]","McLibel follows the incident in the UK where McDonalds filed a libel suit against two everyday citizens, gardener Helen Steel and postman David Morris.  The two concerned citizens passed out pamphlets in front of a McDonalds restaurant attempting to inform customers of the downside of patronizing McDonalds, such as unhealthy food content, the corporations predilections for wasting natural resources, low wages, and animal cruelty in obtaining their meat sources.McDonalds, using an existing UK libel law to order a public apology from the two citizens and stop the distribution of the pamphlets, never thought that these two everyday people would take the libel case all the way.  Through court proceedings on the libel charges, where they were forced to defend themselves and McDonalds spent millions of dollars, all the way to managing to overturn the UK legal system to allow free speech against public corporations, this film covers their important story.However, the film is done on a zero budget, and with the usual British enthusiasm (I'm being facetious) is about as interesting as watching my lawn grow.  The re-enactments are cheesy, the interviews flat, the live footage boring, and the overall length far too long for what content the film had to offer.Yes, this was an important part of freedom of speech stretching across the UK, but I would recommend looking the info up in a library rather than watching the film.

922023,A2VOSR1A3MLFKM,B000A59PR4,"The Captain ""Bounty628""","[4, 6]","I am not a McDonald's sympathizer and in fact I have not even eaten at McDonald's in probably over five years.It should come as no surprise that McDonald's, a global organization that for decades has been raking in the profits, is often times held in a negative light as being nothing more than a money grubbing organization making civilization fat. We have all heard the horror stories associated with fast food consumption and the business practices that fast food companies often employ.So when the film McLibel came up as a recommendation in the trust ole' Netflix list, I figured what did I have to lose to gain some additional fodder for arguments relative to the Big Mac.Answer to what did I have to lose: 85 minutes, the length of the movie.McLibel was a terribly boring film attempting to highlight what seemed to be a somewhat interesting case that took place across the pond in England.Directed by Franny Armstrong and Ken Loach, the movie tells the story of two British activists Helen Steel and Dave Morris who were part of a group that sought to promote social justice on several levels. Part of their mission was to attack McDonald's in terms of both their economic policies and their overreaching global endeavors, as well.As any good activist would do, Steel and Morris took to the streets seeking to wage an information war against Ronald McDonald, Grimace and their pack of friends. With literature, leaflets and their voices, Steel and Morris wanted to disseminate as much information to the British general public as possible.However, what ended up happening was some covert countering against their actions by individuals associated with McDonald's. Spies ended up coming to their meetings to learn more about the work that Steel and Morris were trying to do on their end.The documentary gets its title from the fact that Steel and Morris were in fact sued by McDonald's for libel and slander, charges which the activists flat out denied. They felt as though it was more a case of McDonald's seeking to silence the voices of dissent more than it was that they were in fact in violation of any laws.The movie jumps around a bit from interviews to sort of biographical or historical glimpses back to facts that preceded the making of the movie. The absolutely worst part of the documentary is when there are perhaps the most hokey reeenactments of the court room setting for the trial that McDonald's went through with against the activists. These dramatizations of the courtroom setting seem more as though they could be a skit from a British comedy show than a factual and professional documentary.Nominated in 2005 as the Best British Documentary at the British Independent Film Awards, it is clear as to why the film was nominated and did not win the category. At the end of the film the viewer is sort of left with the notion that really nothing much was learned in the film and the overwhelming thought is, ""Well, no duh."" The film seems almost as though it was made as a way to thank Steel and Morris for their work more so than it was made to really show others factual information about the topic at hand.Of course there was no reaching out to the other side of the table clearly evident in the film which makes me question why you would not want both sides of the issue. We learn plenty about Morris and Steel and about how great the director must feel they are but we do not get to see what McDonald's position was during the whole ordeal. Had this been done, I might feel a little bit differently about the overall quality of the film, except for those terrible courtroom reenactments.McLibel sort of had the capability to be considered a somewhat decent film with at least the basis of  a good factual story to tell. However, the film fell prey to becoming nothing more than what appears to be a bunch of friends making a film about how great they are. The quality of the filmmaking is quite poor and even that makes the film tank even more.McLibel simply leaves this viewer wanting to know one thing: where's the beef?",1,McLibel is McBoring,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,4052,"['am', 'not', 'McDonald', 'sympathizer', 'fact', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'eaten', 'McDonald', 'probably', 'five', 'years.It', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'McDonald', 'global', 'organization', 'decades', 'been', 'raking', 'profits', 'often', 'times', 'held', 'negative', 'light', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'money', 'grubbing', 'organization', 'making', 'civilization', 'fat', 'have', 'heard', 'horror', 'stories', 'associated', 'fast', 'food', 'consumption', 'business', 'practices', 'fast', 'food', 'companies', 'often', 'employ.So', 'when', 'film', 'McLibel', 'came', 'up', 'recommendation', 'trust', 'ole', 'Netflix', 'list', 'figured', 'what', 'did', 'have', 'lose', 'gain', 'additional', 'fodder', 'arguments', 'relative', 'Big', 'Mac.Answer', 'what', 'did', 'have', 'lose', '85', 'minutes', 'length', 'movie.McLibel', 'was', 'terribly', 'boring', 'film', 'attempting', 'highlight', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'case', 'took', 'place', 'pond', 'England.Directed', 'Franny', 'Armstrong', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'movie', 'story', 'two', 'British', 'activists', 'Helen', 'Steel', 'Dave', 'Morris', 'who', 'were', 'part', 'group', 'sought', 'promote', 'social', 'justice', 'several', 'levels', 'Part', 'mission', 'was', 'attack', 'McDonald', 'terms', 'economic', 'policies', 'overreaching', 'global', 'endeavors', 'well.As', 'good', 'activist', 'would', 'do', 'Steel', 'Morris', 'took', 'streets', 'seeking', 'wage', 'information', 'war', 'Ronald', 'McDonald', 'Grimace', 'pack', 'friends', 'literature', 'leaflets', 'voices', 'Steel', 'Morris', 'wanted', 'disseminate', 'much', 'information', 'British', 'general', 'public', 'possible.However', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'happening', 'was', 'covert', 'countering', 'actions', 'individuals', 'associated', 'McDonald', 'Spies', 'ended', 'up', 'coming', 'meetings', 'learn', 'more', 'work', 'Steel', 'Morris', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'end.The', 'documentary', 'title', 'fact', 'Steel', 'Morris', 'were', 'fact', 'sued', 'McDonald', 'libel', 'slander', 'charges', 'activists', 'flat', 'out', 'denied', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'case', 'McDonald', 'seeking', 'silence', 'voices', 'dissent', 'more', 'was', 'were', 'fact', 'violation', 'laws.The', 'movie', 'jumps', 'bit', 'interviews', 'sort', 'biographical', 'historical', 'glimpses', 'back', 'facts', 'preceded', 'making', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'worst', 'part', 'documentary', 'when', 'are', 'perhaps', 'most', 'hokey', 'reeenactments', 'court', 'room', 'setting', 'trial', 'McDonald', 'went', 'activists', 'dramatizations', 'courtroom', 'setting', 'seem', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'skit', 'British', 'comedy', 'show', 'factual', 'professional', 'documentary.Nominated', '2005', 'Best', 'British', 'Documentary', 'British', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Awards', 'clear', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'category', 'end', 'film', 'viewer', 'sort', 'left', 'notion', 'really', 'nothing', 'much', 'was', 'learned', 'film', 'overwhelming', 'thought', 'Well', 'duh', 'film', 'almost', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'thank', 'Steel', 'Morris', 'work', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'made', 'really', 'show', 'others', 'factual', 'information', 'topic', 'hand.Of', 'course', 'was', 'reaching', 'out', 'other', 'side', 'table', 'clearly', 'evident', 'film', 'question', 'why', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'sides', 'issue', 'learn', 'plenty', 'Morris', 'Steel', 'how', 'great', 'director', 'must', 'feel', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'McDonald', 'position', 'was', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'Had', 'been', 'done', 'might', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'differently', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'terrible', 'courtroom', 'reenactments.McLibel', 'sort', 'had', 'capability', 'be', 'considered', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'film', 'least', 'basis', 'good', 'factual', 'story', 'tell', 'However', 'film', 'fell', 'prey', 'becoming', 'nothing', 'more', 'what', 'be', 'bunch', 'friends', 'making', 'film', 'how', 'great', 'are', 'quality', 'filmmaking', 'quite', 'poor', 'even', 'film', 'tank', 'even', 'more.McLibel', 'simply', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'know', 'one', 'thing', 'where', 'beef']",McLibel

Besides, the effort corperation would have to go through to get all the little guys would be difficult in this country, I guess it must have payed off in Britain.

The 2005 follow up show them at the European court aguing this point, and winning it.

922025,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000A59PR4,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 0]","What happens when two environmental activists come head to head with McDonalds in court? One side has billions of dollars (or Pounds since this is in England), unlimited human resources to produce evidence, witnesses, and lawyers, and the other side has... two environmental activists. It doesn't necessarily turn out as you'd expect.McLibel is the story of just such a scenario. Beginning with events as early as 1988, this low-budget documentary unfolds the tale of two activists (Dave Morris and Helen Steel- a postal worker and a gardener, respectively) who refused to bow to McDonald's demands, and instead ended up facing the fast food giant in court for a libel case over an anti-McDonald's pamphlet they had handed out.The footage is fairly low-budget, but it hardly matters because it is edited together in such an expert story-telling fashion. With almost 20 years of footage unfolding bit by bit, it's hard to look away. The audience watches as the case that was supposed to end in 4 weeks ends up lasting 2 and a half years. Through the introduction of the internet, the two defendants are given a broader audience and thus able to call in more expert witnesses to help them.Interviews with Fast Food Nation scribe Eric Schlosser, and several other experts on the subject help move the plot along and add substance to this delightful documentary. The court reenactments are a bit forced, considering they have actors playing the roles of the characters in court, but I guess it would be difficult to reenact the court testimonial in any other way. Also, it feels a bit as if the defense is over-playing their hand when they try to lay the blame on McDonalds for the McDonalds litter lying around the streets and the overly mechanized qaulity of a McDonalds kitchen. They are a business after all.Also, even the defendants themselves acknowledge that they almost feel bad for McDonalds for being so singled out in the trial. For, as they say, McDonalds isn't the only business that's having a negative impact on the world, they're just the only one that tried to sue them for libel.Overall, though, the audience will find themselves cheering for the two unlikely heros, Steel and Morris, as they plough through hardships in their personal lives and make a firm stand against almost insurmountable odds in a case that ends up breaking the record for the longest trial in English history. Later they go on to trial with the English government itself, which is a separate story altogether.The DVD extras include a painfully exposing 27 minutes of a secretly taped meeting with McDonalds executives trying to settle out of court. This 27 minutes alone is enough to convince anyone that McDonalds is not on the up and up. That may seem like old news now, but without such people as Dave Morris and Helen Steel, it might not be.",4,When Corporations Attack,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,2833,"['What', 'when', 'two', 'environmental', 'activists', 'come', 'head', 'head', 'McDonalds', 'court', 'One', 'side', 'billions', 'dollars', 'England', 'unlimited', 'human', 'resources', 'produce', 'evidence', 'witnesses', 'lawyers', 'other', 'side', 'two', 'environmental', 'activists', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'turn', 'out', ""'d"", 'expect.McLibel', 'story', 'just', 'scenario', 'Beginning', 'events', 'as', 'early', '1988', 'low-budget', 'documentary', 'tale', 'two', 'activists', 'Dave', 'Morris', 'Helen', 'Steel-', 'postal', 'worker', 'gardener', 'respectively', 'who', 'refused', 'bow', 'McDonald', 'demands', 'instead', 'ended', 'up', 'facing', 'fast', 'food', 'giant', 'court', 'libel', 'case', 'anti-McDonald', 'pamphlet', 'had', 'handed', 'out.The', 'footage', 'fairly', 'low-budget', 'hardly', 'matters', 'edited', 'together', 'such', 'expert', 'story-telling', 'fashion', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'footage', 'unfolding', 'bit', 'bit', 'hard', 'look', 'away', 'audience', 'watches', 'case', 'was', 'supposed', 'end', '4', 'weeks', 'lasting', '2', 'half', 'years', 'introduction', 'internet', 'two', 'defendants', 'are', 'given', 'broader', 'audience', 'thus', 'able', 'call', 'more', 'expert', 'witnesses', 'help', 'them.Interviews', 'Fast', 'Food', 'Nation', 'scribe', 'Eric', 'Schlosser', 'several', 'other', 'experts', 'subject', 'help', 'move', 'plot', 'add', 'substance', 'delightful', 'documentary', 'court', 'reenactments', 'are', 'bit', 'forced', 'considering', 'have', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'characters', 'court', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'reenact', 'court', 'testimonial', 'other', 'way', 'Also', 'bit', 'defense', 'over-playing', 'hand', 'when', 'try', 'lay', 'blame', 'McDonalds', 'McDonalds', 'litter', 'lying', 'streets', 'overly', 'mechanized', 'qaulity', 'McDonalds', 'kitchen', 'are', 'business', 'all.Also', 'even', 'defendants', 'acknowledge', 'almost', 'feel', 'bad', 'McDonalds', 'being', 'so', 'singled', 'out', 'trial', 'say', 'McDonalds', ""n't"", 'only', 'business', 'having', 'negative', 'impact', 'world', ""'re"", 'just', 'only', 'one', 'tried', 'sue', 'libel.Overall', 'though', 'audience', 'will', 'find', 'cheering', 'two', 'unlikely', 'heros', 'Steel', 'Morris', 'plough', 'hardships', 'personal', 'lives', 'make', 'firm', 'stand', 'almost', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'case', 'up', 'breaking', 'record', 'longest', 'trial', 'English', 'history', 'Later', 'go', 'trial', 'English', 'government', 'separate', 'story', 'altogether.The', 'DVD', 'include', 'painfully', 'exposing', '27', 'minutes', 'secretly', 'taped', 'meeting', 'McDonalds', 'executives', 'trying', 'settle', 'court', '27', 'minutes', 'alone', 'enough', 'convince', 'anyone', 'McDonalds', 'not', 'up', 'up', 'may', 'seem', 'old', 'news', 'now', 'such', 'people', 'Dave', 'Morris', 'Helen', 'Steel', 'might', 'not', 'be']",McLibel
