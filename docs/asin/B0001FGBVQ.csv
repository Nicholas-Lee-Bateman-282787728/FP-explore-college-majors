I've seen the entire sitcom through cable TV, and simply love it, you get into a point that you feel that the entire cast is part of your family. The actors are so sweet! Sadly, Providence is no longer on air, but with the release of this DVD I can keep a copy of those wonderful times watching a great sitcom----OK, I just got the DVD, and it's wonderful, that's all I can say.. Loved the last disc where the some of the cast and crew talked about the show.. it was sooo nice!!Also the bloopers section.. lovely! too bad it wasn't long enough, Good choice on the episoides as well.",5,it's all about the heart,1082764800,"04 24, 2004",2004,613,"['ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entire', 'sitcom', 'cable', 'TV', 'simply', 'love', 'get', 'point', 'feel', 'entire', 'cast', 'part', 'family', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'sweet', 'Sadly', 'Providence', 'no', 'longer', 'air', 'release', 'DVD', 'can', 'keep', 'copy', 'wonderful', 'times', 'watching', 'great', 'sitcom', 'OK', 'just', 'got', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'can', 'say..', 'Loved', 'last', 'disc', 'where', 'cast', 'crew', 'talked', 'show..', 'was', 'sooo', 'nice', 'Also', 'bloopers', 'section..', 'lovely', 'too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'enough', 'Good', 'choice', 'episoides', 'well']",N/A

It's a sort of classy, well-written, stylish forerunner to Gilmore Girls, even though the series seemingly have little in common beyond their production values and intelligence.

Do they not think this show is good enough to warrant  ALL complete seasons on DVD?Does anyone have the word on whether they plan to release all the episodes or not?
