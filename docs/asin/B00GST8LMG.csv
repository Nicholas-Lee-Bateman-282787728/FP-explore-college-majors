1680885,AHF361GC0S8HR,B00GST8LMG,B. Elmore,"[3, 4]","I resisted watching this movie because I thought it would be a &#34;road&#34; movie. I've seen some on Hallmark and it isn't my favorite story line, so I have passed this movie by for weeks and weeks. Today, bored and trying to stay out of the oppressive heat, I rented it. I am so glad that I did.Candace Cameron Bure plays a doctor from the big city who lands in a small &#34;middle of nowhere&#34; town. Because of prior bad acts (not paying parking tickets), she finds herself doing community service for three days. No surprise as a plot device, the town needs a doctor. As the main characters, who represent town folk, seek to win her over, we see the usual country fare. God, church, and community are mentioned, and a dance isnthrown in for good romantic measure. Meanwhile, materialistic doctor-boyfriend is waiting in the Hamptons for Lisa, (Cameron-Bure's character) to complete her journey. He call periodically to remind her that she is costing them major bucks by landing herself in this predicament. I was glad that the film makers didn't complete that typical story arc and make the boyfriend, Steve, a total jerk. He was kind of a jerk, but really, he just didn't get it. The film stays less mean spirited that way.Cute, sappy, contrived, predictable are some of the adjectives used, or at least the thoughts conveyed in some other reviews. All of it is true. If you're not a Christian, and you try really hard, you'll be offended. You'll just have to get over it or ask Amazon for your money back. However, if you're reading this review, you were warned.I thought this was one of the sweetest, freshest, movies to come out of...where? This didn't come out of Hollywood! I'm thankful that someone put down on film and integrated it into a believable story line just how stupid it is to protest a cross in a community where everyone agrees that it should be there.I'm thankful that someone put on film that a woman who &#34;just wants a good life&#34; can find one in this &#34;backwater&#34; setting. One reviewer said that the romance story was contrived, but it's not. I lived it to a degree. I'm a city girl who married a country boy. I looked at the goodness and honesty of his life and left my Beemer dreams behind. And after reading and working and living in a society where it seems no one shares my belief in God, it is so nice to see a Christian film that celebrates belief, that treats belief with respect and shows people with faith as ones to be admired, not mocked.So often in these films, the acting in stilted at best. The locations are contrived, the music is bad. The whole thing just makes you cringe because you want good, Christian entertainment, but you want all of the &#34;Hollywood&#34; stuff as well. This movie delivers! You won't find any of them up for an Oscar, but that's getting to be a secular joke too, isn't it? No, this isn't the best movie I've ever seen. These aren't the best actors. But, this movie made me smile AND I didn't browse the internet while I listened to it, either.  As soon as I finish this review, I intend to buy the DVD. Why? Because the next time I'm bored and it's too hot (it'll be too hot tomorrow and the day after, and the day after...) I'll have it here and I can watch it again.",5,"You've been warned!!

1680891,A1XQP1HXYJCUZP,B00GST8LMG,Dan Coffee,"[1, 2]","I don't know what it is about this movie that causes viewer to believe it is Christian. The most likely explanation is because there are occasional generalized terms implying that a god of some sort is at work, but that's a common element shared by hundreds of beliefs. There are also vague references to Bible content but ... when used as isolated 'sound bytes', the actual meaning of these statements are often taken out of context.Christianity is unique in that unlike any other belief, Christianity teaches that mankind cannot reach God simple by trying hard to do positive actions. Christianity clearly states that NO action is good enough to deserve forgiveness (apart from acknowledging that God has settled the debt when Christ was crucified). Clearly this distinction is NOT present in this story and without it, the religion could just as easily be the Jehovah's Witnesses or Unitarians among others. As for the concept of so-called `Christian values' in the story, even they fail to be present (based on my observation).Being a Christian myself, I find movies like this embarrassing. No. Let me change that to shameful. First off ... Finding Normal is an obvious rip-off of the movie Doc Hollywood, and the feeble attempt to disguise that fact, only serves to make the story even less believable. It does remove several of the low-morals characters which were so plentiful in Doc Hollywood but then makes substitutions which aren't much of an improvement. (I'll explain a bit later on.)There are so many holes in the story that it hardly has enough substance to even hold the holes together. Right from the start ... even if there was a logical reason to drive (rather than fly) all the way from L.A. to Long Island (which isn't justified in the story) she could have driven through NORMAL Illinois and cut 200 miles and several hours off the trip! Another unexplained problem is why she is driving down a 2-lane road in the middle of nowhere when she is pulled over. It's just one senseless situation after another!Supposedly the town of Normal is a microscopically small town in North Carolina but the actual movie sets suggest that it's Louisiana. Whatever! It really doesn't matter (much) except that Louisiana doesn't have mountainous terrain and it would be impossible for the boyfriend in Long Island to drive to even the closest part of Louisiana overnight. [Both of these situations are used for the story.] However ... the most blatantly miswritten part of the story is the totally indefensible suggestion that there are any Christian values present anywhere in the story! How is it that someone writes a fictional story, thusly allowing the characters to be anything they want, and none of the 3 main characters is a good example of proper Christian behavior?Character #1 The doctor/judge (oh yeah ... did I forget to mention moralist and preacher) is using the philosophy that `the end justifies the means', and as part of the plot, he abuses his authority to essentially kidnap the passer-though. Also as part of this scheme he suggests that God is helping to make it happen. Lastly and most unbelievably, it is clearly an attempt to use blackmail to detain the passer-though, ultimately achieving his own selfish goal which is of course to find a replacement for himself, as the town doctor. Nowhere in the Bible are we taught that the end justifies the means, most especially not blackmail!Character #2 The victim of the kidnapping, the lady doctor, becomes disillusioned with her previous ideology of worldly happiness, but she never shows any detectable 'spiritual change' in her priorities apart from the obvious forsaking of wealth in a small town practice.Character #3 The country bumpkin Lucas shows where his heart is when he snookers the high powered ACLU lawyers with the old statue of liberty play, buying a tiny little piece of land that a cross is displayed on, and thus foiling the evil-doers intentions to have it removed. I don't think I'll ever understand why so many professing Christians fight so hard to protect icons and idols (which the Bible clearly states are wrong to make in the first place).What more can I say? It's not hard to find a movie that has a really awful premise but this one really sticks in my craw, because it gives Christianity a black eye!",1,"Typical, but not NORMAL and certainly not Christian",1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,4307,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'viewer', 'believe', 'Christian', 'most', 'likely', 'explanation', 'are', 'occasional', 'generalized', 'terms', 'implying', 'god', 'sort', 'work', 'common', 'element', 'shared', 'hundreds', 'beliefs', 'are', 'also', 'vague', 'references', 'Bible', 'content', 'when', 'used', 'isolated', 'bytes', 'actual', 'meaning', 'statements', 'are', 'often', 'taken', 'out', 'context.Christianity', 'unique', 'other', 'belief', 'Christianity', 'mankind', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'God', 'simple', 'trying', 'hard', 'do', 'positive', 'actions', 'Christianity', 'clearly', 'action', 'good', 'enough', 'deserve', 'forgiveness', 'apart', 'acknowledging', 'God', 'settled', 'debt', 'when', 'Christ', 'was', 'crucified', 'Clearly', 'distinction', 'NOT', 'present', 'story', 'religion', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'Jehovah', 'Witnesses', 'Unitarians', 'others', 'concept', 'so-called', 'Christian', 'values', 'story', 'even', 'fail', 'be', 'present', 'based', 'observation', '.Being', 'Christian', 'myself', 'find', 'movies', 'embarrassing', 'No', 'Let', 'change', 'shameful', 'First', 'Finding', 'Normal', 'obvious', 'rip-off', 'movie', 'Doc', 'Hollywood', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'disguise', 'fact', 'only', 'make', 'story', 'even', 'less', 'believable', 'remove', 'several', 'low-morals', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'plentiful', 'Doc', 'Hollywood', 'then', 'substitutions', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'improvement', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'bit', 'later', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'story', 'hardly', 'enough', 'substance', 'even', 'hold', 'holes', 'together', 'Right', 'start', 'even', 'was', 'logical', 'reason', 'drive', 'rather', 'fly', 'way', 'L.A.', 'Long', 'Island', ""n't"", 'justified', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'driven', 'NORMAL', 'Illinois', 'cut', '200', 'miles', 'several', 'hours', 'trip', 'unexplained', 'problem', 'why', 'driving', 'down', '2-lane', 'road', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'when', 'pulled', 'over', 'just', 'one', 'senseless', 'situation', 'Supposedly', 'town', 'Normal', 'microscopically', 'small', 'town', 'North', 'Carolina', 'actual', 'movie', 'sets', 'suggest', 'Louisiana', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'Louisiana', ""n't"", 'have', 'mountainous', 'terrain', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'boyfriend', 'Long', 'Island', 'drive', 'even', 'closest', 'part', 'Louisiana', 'overnight', '[', 'situations', 'are', 'used', 'story', ']', 'However', 'most', 'blatantly', 'miswritten', 'part', 'story', 'totally', 'indefensible', 'suggestion', 'are', 'Christian', 'values', 'present', 'anywhere', 'story', 'How', 'someone', 'fictional', 'story', 'thusly', 'allowing', 'characters', 'be', 'anything', 'want', 'none', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'good', 'example', 'proper', 'Christian', 'behavior', 'Character', '1', 'doctor/judge', 'oh', 'yeah', 'did', 'forget', 'mention', 'moralist', 'preacher', 'using', 'philosophy', 'end', 'means', 'part', 'plot', 'authority', 'essentially', 'kidnap', 'passer-though', 'Also', 'part', 'scheme', 'God', 'helping', 'make', 'happen', 'Lastly', 'most', 'unbelievably', 'clearly', 'attempt', 'use', 'blackmail', 'detain', 'passer-though', 'ultimately', 'achieving', 'own', 'selfish', 'goal', 'course', 'find', 'replacement', 'town', 'doctor', 'Nowhere', 'Bible', 'are', 'taught', 'end', 'means', 'most', 'especially', 'not', 'blackmail', 'Character', '2', 'victim', 'kidnapping', 'lady', 'doctor', 'becomes', 'disillusioned', 'previous', 'ideology', 'worldly', 'happiness', 'never', 'detectable', ""'spiritual"", 'change', 'priorities', 'apart', 'obvious', 'forsaking', 'wealth', 'small', 'town', 'practice.Character', '3', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'Lucas', 'shows', 'where', 'heart', 'when', 'high', 'powered', 'ACLU', 'lawyers', 'old', 'statue', 'liberty', 'play', 'buying', 'tiny', 'little', 'piece', 'land', 'cross', 'displayed', 'thus', 'foiling', 'evil-doers', 'intentions', 'have', 'removed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'professing', 'Christians', 'fight', 'so', 'hard', 'protect', 'icons', 'idols', 'Bible', 'clearly', 'states', 'are', 'wrong', 'make', 'first', 'place', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'not', 'hard', 'find', 'movie', 'really', 'awful', 'premise', 'one', 'really', 'craw', 'Christianity', 'black', 'eye']",N/A

Second, exactly where is the town of Normal? According to the synopsis, it is in North Carolina.
