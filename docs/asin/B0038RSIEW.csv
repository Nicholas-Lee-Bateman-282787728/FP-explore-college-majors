The family ends up purchasing a creepy house in the middle of nowhere which is filled with sinister secrets and strange occurrences.While this plot is predictable and has been pursued many times before, I still gave the film a chance because I liked the overall sense of suspense and eeriness that the movie projected.  However, Kevin Costner's portrayal of a conflicted father was definitely not ""academy award"" material, and many of the characters introduced and plot twists went nowhere.  Yet, the most disappointing part of the movie was the ending itself.  It was completely unbelievable, and I found myself asking, ""Seriously?

He is a good father and the area the house is on is beautiful.  They discover an Indian Burial Mound on the property.  They ignore it fo the most part until things with the daughter start to go down hill fast.Was it PACKED with Jump scenes?No.  It just fed further and further into the premise like a real person would, or might do if confronted with such a thing.Where there monsters or Ghosts?Not per say... but what is there is a neat twist on the mounds builders premise.In short this film is very well made with a good story and nice build.

Maybe I'm a new version of myself, and the old version of myself saw this film in another life?  Not likely. . . .I usually really like Kevin Costner.  I think that he's taken a bad rap lately, but maybe he deserves that rap in this film.  I watched ""Hatfield and McCoys"" not very long ago and for a mini-series, it was very good.  Perhaps excellent if you consider it was made-for-TV.  But Mr. Costner here is a cliched mess, being an author (ack!  I hate it when authors are in books or movies since I think it's a little lazy) and he's just too touchy-feely.  Where are all of the strong male leads nowadays?  Guess all the women get the good roles nowadays in an odd reversal.Now, it's hard to review this film without giving much away, not that there's really anything interesting to give away.  But I will say this:  what's wrong with having a new daughter, when the old daughter was pouty, stuck up, antagonistic, and yes, pretty.  But she knew it.

I did have time to pass by my local blockbuster to see what would interest me. As many reviewers have stated here they were surprised, like myself, that there was a movie starring Kevin Costner that neither them nor I had heard about. The details of the flick in the back of the cover seemed intriguing and I decided to go ahead with the rental.First of all, I am a big fan of these movies; nor fast nor slow in its progress. A good plot slowly but surely developing through the film and a nice twisted possibly unexpected ending that will leave you satisfy with what you had witnessed before. It obviously has its scary scenes, and will give you a jump every now and then. A great cast led by Kevin Costner that by custom gives a good performance. I was very surprised in seeing the little girl from Pan's Labyrinth only that in this role, she speaks English, and I hardly noticed an accent.The only reason why this movie is getting poor reviews is for my understanding, not a fast pace flick or not `scary' enough for one's taste.  Indeed, not all movies were intended for every viewer, but I was disappointed in seeing the star rating in general when I was expecting at least 4 stars -same as my rating-. My advice is to either way give it a try, you might love it and you might hate it (I guess).

The whole story is simple but the direction, acting and characters are unbelievable! The daughter had a sweet and innocent look but will creep you out; in fact I had some of the worst nightmares after watching it!Here is the story line: After a recent divorce, the father will take his son and adopted daughter (who secretly mad at the mother for abandon them) to a rural place in South Carolina! It's suitable for the father since he's a writer but not the children, who will find it boring and will feel secluded!Obviously, the kids will go around and explore the woods! The girl would feel attracted to the mound and will invite the father and bro, but they wouldn't go up w/her! She will form the habit of going to that mount every night and that's when her strange behavior will begin! One time, the father found her sleep walking on her room, mud from her foot prints all over the stairs, but he'll keep convincing himself that it's due to her teenage, or parents' divorce and when he finally found out about the mound it'll be late to save her and that's the sad part!The father will find the old man whose granddaughter transformed just like Louisa( at the end)! The man will tell him that he had no option but to burn down the whole house w/his granddaughter on it since she wasn't the same anymore. Later, the father will find out from some anthropologists that the mound was a place for gods and deities worship. The evil creatures dwell on the mound wait for a girl (which they call the queen) to come over and mate w/them so it can renew their spirits! It was impressive how the young girl will fall a victim and no matter how the father try to save her life later by taking down the mound, he won't be able to, it's too late once she mated w/the creatures, it's like she's gone to the dark side and there is no coming back!The movie had some great hints and that's what I found most impressive.1- When the family first moves, the little boy will find rifle w/bullets on it! The father will take it away from him and then he will get mad and call the landowner for leaving it there; hinting that the first family who lived in the house was in need of a weapon!2-The little bro science project in school involve ants who were going to die unless they find a queen; hinting that the daughter should be given to the creatures otherwise they'd die and so they had to attract her to the mount so she can mate and renew their spirits!3- After the daughter was picked on by a mean girl in school, she will go home and pick on her doll the same way she was picked on! The doll here represents herself, then she will go to the mound to mate w/ the creatures and come back w/some ugly doll made of straw, hinting that now she's not the same anymore! She gave away a pretty doll (her soul) and came back as an ugly freakish doll!4- The anthropologist will tell him that the creatures exchange gifts, like dolls and straws and that's exactly what the girl did when she exchanged her doll!5- There were many incidents as well like killing the baby sitter, the little boy teacher or anyone that the daughter wouldn't like, he will be killed by the creatures...hinting that she's their queenThe end is real touchy when the boy would beg his dad to stay with him and not follow the girl to the mound but still the father can't give up on her! He will find her unconscious and he will  try to save her but won't be able to when she started transforming just like the other creatures.... leaving him with no option but to burn the mound down and the movie leaves the viewer to answer whether or not the father and the son would come out alive",5,IMPRESSIVE AND SCARY,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,3720,"[""'m"", 'not', 'review', 'person', 'sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'w/out', 'showing', 'appreciation', 'whole', 'story', 'simple', 'direction', 'acting', 'characters', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'daughter', 'had', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'look', 'will', 'creep', 'out', 'fact', 'had', 'worst', 'nightmares', 'watching', 'Here', 'story', 'line', 'recent', 'divorce', 'father', 'will', 'take', 'son', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'who', 'secretly', 'mad', 'mother', 'abandon', 'rural', 'place', 'South', 'Carolina', 'suitable', 'father', 'writer', 'not', 'children', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'boring', 'will', 'feel', 'secluded', 'Obviously', 'kids', 'will', 'go', 'around', 'explore', 'woods', 'girl', 'would', 'feel', 'attracted', 'mound', 'will', 'invite', 'father', 'bro', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'up', 'w/her', 'will', 'form', 'habit', 'going', 'mount', 'night', 'when', 'strange', 'behavior', 'will', 'begin', 'One', 'time', 'father', 'found', 'sleep', 'walking', 'room', 'mud', 'foot', 'prints', 'stairs', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'convincing', 'due', 'teenage', 'parents', 'divorce', 'when', 'finally', 'found', 'out', 'mound', ""'ll"", 'be', 'late', 'save', 'sad', 'part', 'father', 'will', 'find', 'old', 'man', 'granddaughter', 'transformed', 'just', 'Louisa', 'end', 'man', 'will', 'tell', 'had', 'option', 'burn', 'down', 'whole', 'house', 'w/his', 'granddaughter', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'anymore', 'Later', 'father', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'anthropologists', 'mound', 'was', 'place', 'gods', 'deities', 'worship', 'evil', 'creatures', 'dwell', 'mound', 'wait', 'girl', 'call', 'queen', 'come', 'mate', 'w/them', 'can', 'renew', 'spirits', 'was', 'impressive', 'how', 'young', 'girl', 'will', 'fall', 'victim', 'matter', 'how', 'father', 'try', 'save', 'life', 'later', 'taking', 'down', 'mound', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'too', 'late', 'mated', 'w/the', 'creatures', 'gone', 'dark', 'side', 'coming', 'back', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'hints', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'impressive.1-', 'When', 'family', 'first', 'moves', 'little', 'boy', 'will', 'find', 'rifle', 'w/bullets', 'father', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'then', 'will', 'get', 'mad', 'call', 'landowner', 'leaving', 'there', 'hinting', 'first', 'family', 'who', 'lived', 'house', 'was', 'need', 'weapon', '2-The', 'little', 'bro', 'science', 'project', 'school', 'involve', 'ants', 'who', 'were', 'going', 'die', 'find', 'queen', 'hinting', 'daughter', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'creatures', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'die', 'so', 'had', 'attract', 'mount', 'can', 'mate', 'renew', 'spirits', '3-', 'daughter', 'was', 'picked', 'mean', 'girl', 'school', 'will', 'go', 'home', 'pick', 'doll', 'same', 'way', 'was', 'picked', 'doll', 'here', 'then', 'will', 'go', 'mound', 'mate', 'creatures', 'come', 'back', 'w/some', 'ugly', 'doll', 'made', 'straw', 'hinting', 'now', 'not', 'same', 'anymore', 'gave', 'away', 'pretty', 'doll', 'soul', 'came', 'back', 'ugly', 'freakish', 'doll', '4-', 'anthropologist', 'will', 'tell', 'creatures', 'exchange', 'gifts', 'dolls', 'straws', 'exactly', 'what', 'girl', 'did', 'when', 'exchanged', 'doll', '5-', 'were', 'many', 'incidents', 'as', 'well', 'killing', 'baby', 'sitter', 'little', 'boy', 'teacher', 'anyone', 'daughter', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'creatures', 'hinting', 'queenThe', 'end', 'real', 'touchy', 'when', 'boy', 'would', 'beg', 'dad', 'stay', 'not', 'follow', 'girl', 'mound', 'still', 'father', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'will', 'find', 'unconscious', 'will', 'try', 'save', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'when', 'started', 'transforming', 'just', 'other', 'creatures', 'leaving', 'option', 'burn', 'mound', 'down', 'movie', 'viewer', 'answer', 'not', 'father', 'son', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'alive']",N/A
1333055,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B0038RSIEW,Jean-ren Leroux,"[3, 5]","*** Spoiler Alert ***Here in Qu&eacute;bec, this movie went straight to the DVD store. Just by looking at the cover art, you guess that this is a B-Movie. You read the summary behind the box and you are now sure of one thing: this is not gonna be that good. Another ""Hide And Seek"" but even worse. With all the clich&eacute;s and a terrible ending.But then you see the name of Kevin Costner. You say to yourself: ""Hey, he's not stupid. He's an educated person who more than often comes out with good stories that hold themselves together. Maybe this will come up as a little surpise gem"". And so you give it a try.But just before you put it in, you remember that Kevin Costner also did ""Swing Vote"", ""Mr. Brooks"" and ""Dragonfly"" and you go: ""Oups! He's also capable of not-so-great films"".The movie starts and the general atmosphere is okay. There is a certain credibility to the rythm of it all. Certain things are obviously put there to pay off later. There is a more-than-obvious metaphore going on involving ants, interrupted discussions that will have to stretch and be resolved later on, a more-than-basic love interest that will probably suffer the same faith as the one played by Elizabeth Shue in ""Hide And Seek"", a bizarre character that will scare us but reveal something important, etc.. You guess pretty much everything that will follow and the acting is not that great but not that worse either. At the worst, you'll be lightly entertained.But then, forget the clich&eacute;s. The stupid stuff happens, the non-logical things that nobody would do in that same situation. Like leaving your scared son in a house full of monsters (because how can you be sure you killed them all?), going in a hole in the ground where you know monsters are hiding and while your son is still left alone in a house full of monsters, not making more fuss about the front door being always open, leaving AGAIN your son alone in a room with your daughter that you know is a killer and surely possessed, etc... Of course, the police officer gets eaten, of course, the love interest gets killed, of course...But forget all that, you knew it would probably happen. Too bad for you. You took a chance. You lost. Another bad movie.But then, you listen to the special features just so you can be amazed as to why on earth Kevin Costner did this.The real horror begins.Producer, writer, director, actors and Kevin Costner all seem to think they made a genuine classic. They are dead-serious and they talk about intentions, motivations, GREAT story, amazing dedication, EXCEPTIONAL and ORIGINAL themes all while showing serious faces.How can they be so unconnected with reality?And the last word comes from Kevin Costner himself. He hopes that the movie will make people afraid of the dark while they sleep, the same way an old film did for him (""Hush, Hush - something"").And then you think: ""Wait a minute. We're not talking about ghosts. We're talking about little monsters that obviously could never exists. Why would i be afraid?""Then, you also remember that Kevin Costner did incredible films like ""Dances With Wolves"", ""Fied Of Dreams"", ""JFK"", ""Thirteen Days"" and so on. All logical from begining to end.For me, that is the scariest part of this whole DVD.",1,Want to be real scared? Listen to the special features.

1333056,A1RSXP7MB772E3,B0038RSIEW,"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[1, 1]","The New Daughter is chilling fiction in which a father and his family are confronted by something haunting at home. Ivana Baquero plays Louisa convincingly as the coming-of-age daughter written with a new spin. One of the movies strengths is in the story, which is interesting and varied. But the ending is morbidly lacking.The New Daughter is based on the very short story by John Connolly and is on sale and within the collection of stories named Nocturnes. I did not think that there was enough going on in the short story to make a movie as it has no climax itself. It is glaringly apparent in the movie, which I will not spoil for you (if that is the appropriate term to still use). But does that make the movie thoroughly upsetting? I would say no.The father-daughter, and father-son relationship is touching, and you feel the tearing of those bonds at your heart when Louisa changes. There is a bond made by memorable, and heart rending scenes that make this movie great at times. There is an absolute terror when night comes, and the sounds that are produced in the night will make you reach for the light switch. You feel as alone and terrified as Louisa when she sits in her attic room listening late at night to the trampling of feet on the roof and just outside her window.There is a restrain that holds back what the viewers are allowed to witness, and the mystery climbs and climbs at the strange things happening. We are never directly told what the mound means or why this is happening, instead we are told by different means. You are made to link different stories belonging to folklore, and strange coincidences to get an idea. Sam begins to make analogies with his colony of all male ants, which worship and protect their queen ant for survival. Anthological history pieced with Indian folklore and other stories tell us of an extinct race of mound walkers that worshipped the burial mounds. We never know what to believe, but it is all foreboding.But the stories begin to take a reality as the climax approaches. The horror fleshes out as it becomes clear that Louisa is being stalked by some night creatures (mound walkers?). More than that, Louisa seems to be changing for the worse. How do you stop a mythological deity when its desperate goal of continuing its race involves your precious daughter? The movie tackles difficult and emotional dilemmas. There is an overwhelming feeling of helplessness in this movie as the mythological roles foretold are blossoming unchecked. The father reaches out for help, but how do you convince the real world to believe in silly folklore, when it appears your daughter is merely experiencing the natural changes that comes to teenage girls?The New Daughter does not do enough in the end. The buildup is sufficient and the details are mysterious and fascinating, but the sloppy and morose ending does not live up its own buildup. We are left with an admirable acting job, besides some slip up moments by actor Kevin Costner and some bad photography towards to end which I thought to be too grainy in scenes of near darkness (this is a problem with filming digitally over film).",4,Daughter coming of age story confused with horror,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,3138,"['New', 'Daughter', 'chilling', 'fiction', 'father', 'family', 'are', 'confronted', 'something', 'haunting', 'home', 'Ivana', 'Baquero', 'Louisa', 'convincingly', 'coming-of-age', 'daughter', 'written', 'new', 'spin', 'One', 'movies', 'strengths', 'story', 'interesting', 'varied', 'ending', 'morbidly', 'lacking.The', 'New', 'Daughter', 'based', 'very', 'short', 'story', 'John', 'Connolly', 'sale', 'collection', 'stories', 'named', 'Nocturnes', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'enough', 'going', 'short', 'story', 'make', 'movie', 'climax', 'glaringly', 'apparent', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'appropriate', 'term', 'still', 'use', 'make', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'upsetting', 'would', 'say', 'no.The', 'father-daughter', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'touching', 'feel', 'tearing', 'bonds', 'heart', 'when', 'Louisa', 'changes', 'bond', 'made', 'memorable', 'heart', 'rending', 'scenes', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'times', 'absolute', 'terror', 'when', 'night', 'sounds', 'are', 'produced', 'night', 'will', 'make', 'reach', 'light', 'switch', 'feel', 'alone', 'terrified', 'Louisa', 'when', 'attic', 'room', 'listening', 'late', 'night', 'trampling', 'feet', 'roof', 'just', 'restrain', 'back', 'what', 'viewers', 'are', 'allowed', 'witness', 'mystery', 'climbs', 'climbs', 'strange', 'things', 'happening', 'are', 'never', 'directly', 'told', 'what', 'mound', 'why', 'happening', 'instead', 'are', 'told', 'different', 'means', 'are', 'made', 'link', 'different', 'stories', 'belonging', 'folklore', 'strange', 'coincidences', 'get', 'idea', 'Sam', 'make', 'analogies', 'colony', 'male', 'ants', 'worship', 'protect', 'queen', 'ant', 'survival', 'Anthological', 'history', 'pieced', 'Indian', 'folklore', 'other', 'stories', 'tell', 'extinct', 'race', 'mound', 'walkers', 'worshipped', 'burial', 'mounds', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'believe', 'foreboding.But', 'stories', 'begin', 'take', 'reality', 'climax', 'approaches', 'horror', 'out', 'clear', 'Louisa', 'being', 'stalked', 'night', 'creatures', 'mound', 'walkers', 'More', 'Louisa', 'be', 'changing', 'worse', 'How', 'do', 'stop', 'mythological', 'deity', 'when', 'desperate', 'goal', 'continuing', 'race', 'precious', 'daughter', 'movie', 'difficult', 'emotional', 'dilemmas', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'helplessness', 'movie', 'mythological', 'roles', 'foretold', 'are', 'blossoming', 'unchecked', 'father', 'out', 'help', 'how', 'do', 'convince', 'real', 'world', 'believe', 'silly', 'folklore', 'when', 'daughter', 'merely', 'experiencing', 'natural', 'changes', 'teenage', 'girls', 'New', 'Daughter', 'not', 'do', 'enough', 'end', 'buildup', 'sufficient', 'details', 'are', 'mysterious', 'fascinating', 'sloppy', 'morose', 'ending', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'own', 'buildup', 'are', 'left', 'admirable', 'acting', 'job', 'slip', 'up', 'moments', 'actor', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'bad', 'photography', 'towards', 'end', 'thought', 'be', 'too', 'grainy', 'scenes', 'near', 'darkness', 'problem', 'filming', 'digitally', 'film']",N/A
1333057,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B0038RSIEW,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[0, 2]","SPOILERS AHEAD!Kevin Costner should be awarded something for giving us the most sleepy, laid-back, phlegmatic performance in movie history. He makes Kharis, our shuffling Mummy, look like superman.In this grade-z movie offering, Costner portrays the sleepy, drowsy, laid-back father of a little boy and one of the  most insufferable brats in horror movie lore. Oh, by the way, she's the ""daughter"" who becomes ""the new daughter"" because of her obsession with an Indian mound in the backyard of her new home, located out in the middle of nowhere. You see, this is the perfect place to bring two troubled kids whose divorced mother didn't want them. After watching them for five minutes, you can understand why.The daughter snarls at her well-meaning father over everything from his attempts to cook her breakfast to the house she lives in. She's insulting, vicious and I kept wishing that Costner would belt her one--but then he was too laid-back, sleepy and phlegmatic to even consider something that would cause him so much energy.When we finally see the monsters, we see instantly that they're mere humans dressed up in body suits and facial makeup. You'd think that in the year 2010, when CGI and animation have progressed to dizzying expertise, that the flmmakers could have come up with something more frightening.We finally see these creature because Costner has suddenly stirred himself to go out into the woods at midnight and dig into the indian mound and guess what--he finds a tunnel--and then he finds the little monsters.Several scenes stand out because of their confusing details. In one, a girl bully at school meets the new daughter on a stairwell and asks her what's wrong. The next thing we know, the father comes to rescue his little monster while the bully sits a few feet away with a broken arm.  Neither one says anything and so we wonder if our little heroine pushed her or did something mental to make her fall.A second puzzling scene is when the woman babysitter is ordered by the father not to allow his strange daughter to go out into the night. The woman vows to obey. But in the next scene, we see our wandering daughter head outside to her beloved Indian mound.  The babysitter doesn't seem to care, even when the demon child returns with mud covering her lower torso. The woman merely smiles and says tenderly ""Oh, you've been outside.

Bernabo,"[0, 2]","After his wife divorces him and leaves her family behind, novelist John James (Kevin Costner) moves his teenage daughter, Louisa (Ivana Baquero) and young son, Sam (Gattlin Griffith), into a country house in South Carolina.  The twin pressures of adolescence and divorce are driving father and daughter farther and farther apart, and that is before John discovers the giant mound burial mound in the backyard.  Louisa is strangely attracted to the mound, and then starts acting strangely, while John learns that his realtor neglected to inform him that the previous owner of the house disappeared, after having locked her daughter in her room.  Things are starting to add up, and not in a good way.  The problem is that this is yet another horror film in which as soon as you get to see that which cannot be seen, you roll your eyes and either shake your head or start laughing.Kevin Costner has been getting a lot of good press these days because he owns Ocean Therapy Solutions and has sold a bunch of his oil separation machines to BP to deal with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  That is great, not just because his machines will help with the disaster in the gulf, but also because that good press will help people forget he made this 2009 movie.  As I was watching ""The New Daughter"" I was suddenly flashing back on when former Oscar winner Ray Milland ended up making ""The Thing With Two Heads,"" and thinking of how far the mighty have fallen.  But then I realized that it is not like Costner has been making a string of bad movies in recent years and has been down so far that a movie like this constitutes some sort of lifeline. His last six movies before this one were ""Swing Vote,"" ""Mr. Brooks,"" ""The Guardian,"" ""Rumor Has It,"" ""The Upside of Anger"" (arguably his best performance to date), and ""Open Range.""  There must have been something hear that attracted his interest, but whatever that was did not translate to the screen.Ultimately this film is disappointing because it has several things going for it, although the title is not one of them, since it really does not describe this movie.  Costner is certainly believable as the father, and the daughter is played by Baquero, who was the star of the best movie I saw in 2006, ""El laberinto del fauno.""  Their relationship has a believable tension (and why I end up rounding up on this movie), and even without whatever is in that mound in the backyard, John has to rescue Louisa from the path she is walking down, or at least try.  Unfortunately, the negative aspects of the movie outweigh our interest in that familial battle.  The burial mound idea is certainly interesting, and immediately caught my attention.  The screenplay by John Travis (""The Haunting Of Molly Hartley""), is based on a short story by an Irish writer, John Connolly, which would have had the virtue of letting our imagination populate the mound rather than resorting to special effects.Director Luis Berdejo seems to be trying to follow the success of Guillermo del Toro with ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and Juan Antonio Bayona with ""The Orphanage,"" but has much more success with the interior scenes than the darker scenes filmed outside.  This is also a film that lets the soundtrack try to carry too much of the load, and instead of being effective, it merely become oppressive.  The final nail is the end of this one, which fails to offer anything new or memorable that could have salvaged ""The New Daughter.""  If Kevin Costner was not the start of this movie, it might fare better, because having him in it certainly raises the ante on our expectations, but he is and despite his efforts the result is just disappointing.",3,Whatever convinced Kevin Costner to make this movie did not make it to the screen,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,3659,"['wife', 'family', 'novelist', 'John', 'James', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Louisa', 'Ivana', 'Baquero', 'young', 'son', 'Sam', 'Gattlin', 'Griffith', 'country', 'house', 'South', 'Carolina', 'twin', 'pressures', 'adolescence', 'divorce', 'are', 'driving', 'father', 'daughter', 'farther', 'farther', 'apart', 'John', 'giant', 'mound', 'burial', 'mound', 'backyard', 'Louisa', 'strangely', 'attracted', 'mound', 'then', 'acting', 'strangely', 'John', 'realtor', 'neglected', 'inform', 'previous', 'owner', 'house', 'disappeared', 'having', 'locked', 'daughter', 'room', 'Things', 'are', 'starting', 'add', 'up', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'problem', 'yet', 'horror', 'film', 'as', 'soon', 'get', 'see', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'roll', 'eyes', 'shake', 'head', 'start', 'laughing.Kevin', 'Costner', 'been', 'getting', 'lot', 'good', 'press', 'days', 'Ocean', 'Therapy', 'Solutions', 'sold', 'bunch', 'oil', 'separation', 'machines', 'BP', 'deal', 'Deepwater', 'Horizon', 'oil', 'spill', 'great', 'not', 'just', 'machines', 'will', 'help', 'disaster', 'gulf', 'also', 'good', 'press', 'will', 'help', 'people', 'forget', 'made', '2009', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'New', 'Daughter', 'was', 'suddenly', 'flashing', 'back', 'when', 'former', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'Thing', 'Two', 'Heads', 'thinking', 'how', 'far', 'mighty', 'have', 'fallen', 'then', 'realized', 'not', 'like', 'Costner', 'been', 'making', 'string', 'bad', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'been', 'down', 'so', 'far', 'movie', 'sort', 'lifeline', 'last', 'six', 'movies', 'one', 'were', 'Swing', 'Vote', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'Guardian', 'Rumor', 'Has', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'Open', 'Range', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'hear', 'attracted', 'interest', 'whatever', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'screen.Ultimately', 'film', 'disappointing', 'several', 'things', 'going', 'title', 'not', 'one', 'really', 'not', 'describe', 'movie', 'Costner', 'certainly', 'believable', 'father', 'daughter', 'played', 'Baquero', 'who', 'was', 'star', 'best', 'movie', 'saw', '2006', 'El', 'laberinto', 'del', 'fauno', 'relationship', 'believable', 'tension', 'why', 'end', 'up', 'rounding', 'up', 'movie', 'even', 'mound', 'backyard', 'John', 'rescue', 'Louisa', 'path', 'walking', 'down', 'least', 'try', 'Unfortunately', 'negative', 'aspects', 'movie', 'outweigh', 'interest', 'familial', 'battle', 'burial', 'mound', 'idea', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'immediately', 'caught', 'attention', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Travis', 'Haunting', 'Molly', 'Hartley', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Irish', 'writer', 'John', 'Connolly', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'virtue', 'letting', 'imagination', 'populate', 'mound', 'rather', 'resorting', 'special', 'effects.Director', 'Luis', 'Berdejo', 'be', 'trying', 'follow', 'success', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Bayona', 'Orphanage', 'much', 'more', 'success', 'interior', 'scenes', 'darker', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'outside', 'also', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'try', 'carry', 'too', 'much', 'load', 'instead', 'being', 'effective', 'merely', 'become', 'oppressive', 'final', 'nail', 'end', 'one', 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'memorable', 'could', 'have', 'salvaged', 'New', 'Daughter', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'was', 'not', 'start', 'movie', 'might', 'fare', 'better', 'having', 'certainly', 'ante', 'expectations', 'efforts', 'result', 'just', 'disappointing']",N/A

Others do so by being put into movies that offer them up as the best part of the film. Such is the case with the release this week of THE NEW DAUGHTER starring Kevin Costner.Costner plays John James, a recent divorcee who has moved his children to a rural town called Mercy in South Carolina. Son Sam (Gattlin Griffin) has no problems with the move. But daughter Louisa (Ivanna Banquero) is the typical troublesome teen, taking her anger out on dad while honestly feeling as if her mother has abandoned the entire family.The James family has moved into a fairly large house, the stately two story southern white house with a large front porch. Here, John hopes to get back on track writing once more. The kids find the place incredibly boring and go exploring the grounds. Its there that they come across something odd, a mound in the woods nearby that seems to hold a mysterious fascination for Louisa. Gee, what are the odds that something mysterious will involve the mound?As the kids begin to adapt to their new locale and new school, Louisa finds herself picked on by one of the girls in her class. Not one to start anything, the incident goes unreported. But anyone who's seen a film of this sort knows that the girl will eventually get what's coming to her.As the film progresses, Louisa begins to act stranger with each passing day. Sleepwalking that leaves tracks of dirt and mud through that house as she wanders to the mound, covered in dirt when she comes home and more lead John to suspect something just isn't right. But he's not quite sure if it's something with the new locale, the divorce, a friendship with his son's teacher (played by Samantha Mathis) or just a guilt trip where he fells he's a bad parent.Blatant metaphor time! Throughout the film we see young Sam having to deal with a science project from school. It's an ant farm and he watches with a keen interest as the ants slowly begin to seem to die, only to reveal later that they were in fact just waiting for the new queen to emerge. For those not in the know, this is a blatant smack in the face hint at what's to come.As John begins to look deeper into things, he learns that the house has a history. The last owners fled the house and took up elsewhere. And in their new location, the young daughter of the previous owner was killed in a fire in their new house. When John goes there to investigate, the grandfather is still living in the charred remains of the house and talks to John about doing what needs to be done, describing how he burned the house and his granddaughter in it. Repulsed by his admission, John leaves and heads home.I could ruin the film and fill in the details of the last portion of the film but a few of you might actually enjoy the film. And in truth, while it is rather obvious in the things that happen, it still offers a mild piece of entertainment. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen and it's very well made. It just all feels so obvious.Costner deserves better than this. He's had his share of megaflops (that I've actually enjoyed including WATERWORLD and THE POSTMAN) but we also need to remember this is the star of FIELD OF DREAMS and DANCES WITH WOLVES. Costner has always reminded me of Gary Cooper in his aw shucks way and obvious ability to bring forth a good character. Let's just hope that Costner can finally get back on track with something that uses his talents better than this.I was hard pressed to decide if this film deserved 3 or 4 stars. On the whole, it was rather simple, plenty obvious in where it was going for a horror fan and offered little suspense.

Although most of the story is cliched to the point of banality, it does have two bright spots:1) Less is more in a story like this, and because Berdijo films  the more violent scenes with much left to the imagination, it's all the more chilling. The scene where the elderly babysitter meets her gruesome fate genuinely scared me.2) A truly original horror monster. I don't think this particular Native American myth has been touched on in movies or books. Some reviewers might find it a little ridiculous, but is it any more ridiculous than the concept of the vampire or genetically engineered alien/human hybrids?Kevin Costner (who usually acts with all the charisma of a plank of wood) does a pretty good job of a dad who's wife has walked out on him and his kids, and he's left with the sole parental duty of raising them. He wasn't much of a father before, so his relationship with his kids is already fragile. And like most movie single-parents who are emotionally damaged, he moves his family into a rambling, decaying house in the middle of nowhere and right next to the site of a massacre. His sullen pre-teen daughter develops an unhealthy attraction for a huge mound of dirt on the property, and things start to get weird.This movie is worth watching.

The ending is particularly bad.  Dad decides to sacrifice himself but not save his doomed daughter while leaving his young son alone for life (his mother has already abandoned him).  BUT as the film ends here comes the last remaining creature who apparently is going to kill the youngster. Does he or does he not?  We will never know, as the credits then roll.  Remind you of a 1950s SciFi film where the monster is killed but in the final scene before the fade, there is an egg cracking releasing yet another monster. OOOOOOOO!

Costner's performance is low key (some critics have called it ""wooden"") as single father, writer, John James who is trying to rebuild his family after a painful divorce and further burdened with sole custody and the all the requisite obligations of raising his teenage daughter Louisa (a terrific Ivana Baquero) and son (Gattlin Griffith).The three have just moved into a remote house in a new location - a location apparently sacred to ancient dwellers on the land.  There's a prominent burial mound on the property of peculiar interest to the James kids and to university anthropologists.  As events unfold, Costner's character wrongly assumes the problems and challenges of his children are due to his limited parenting skills.  He is wrong.  The threats facing him and his children are ancient and evil and deadly.I was surprised how much I enjoyed this little horror exercise.  I liked the way it looked and the surprising story that was not telegraphed by the title of the box art.  This is Luis Berdejo's directorial debut of an English language film.  He also wrote the screenplay for QUARANTINE.  He has a fine eye and ear for understated, moody, unsettling horror that creeps up on you and goes a little further than you expect.  He is skilled at drawing the viewer into a slightly surreal universe in the midst of an ordinary, sunny day.  Samantha Mathis co-stars as a concerned and friendly teacher.  John Travis adapted the screenplay from a short story by John Connolly.",4,MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,1794,"['Limited', 'theatrical', 'release', 'then', 'quick', 'appearance', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'retail', 'shelves', 'usually', 'sign', 'less', 'engrossing', 'film.But', 'not', 'am', 'not', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'fan', 'was', 'not', 'bored', 'involving', 'weird', 'atmospheric', 'little', 'horror', 'story', 'set', 'rural', 'contemporary', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Costner', 'performance', 'low', 'key', 'critics', 'have', 'called', 'wooden', 'single', 'father', 'writer', 'John', 'James', 'who', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'family', 'painful', 'divorce', 'further', 'burdened', 'sole', 'custody', 'requisite', 'obligations', 'raising', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Louisa', 'terrific', 'Ivana', 'Baquero', 'son', 'Gattlin', 'Griffith', '.The', 'three', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'remote', 'house', 'new', 'location', 'location', 'apparently', 'sacred', 'ancient', 'dwellers', 'land', 'prominent', 'burial', 'mound', 'property', 'peculiar', 'interest', 'James', 'kids', 'university', 'anthropologists', 'events', 'unfold', 'Costner', 'character', 'wrongly', 'problems', 'challenges', 'children', 'are', 'due', 'limited', 'parenting', 'skills', 'wrong', 'threats', 'facing', 'children', 'are', 'ancient', 'evil', 'deadly.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'horror', 'exercise', 'liked', 'way', 'looked', 'surprising', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'telegraphed', 'title', 'box', 'art', 'Luis', 'Berdejo', 'directorial', 'debut', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'QUARANTINE', 'fine', 'eye', 'ear', 'understated', 'moody', 'unsettling', 'horror', 'up', 'little', 'further', 'expect', 'skilled', 'drawing', 'viewer', 'slightly', 'surreal', 'universe', 'midst', 'ordinary', 'sunny', 'day', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'co-stars', 'concerned', 'friendly', 'teacher', 'John', 'Travis', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'short', 'story', 'John', 'Connolly']",N/A
1333077,A387BD735MI50R,B0038RSIEW,R. Schultz,"[4, 5]","This movie kept me interested and taut from the start, when it established an eerie sense of nature's drive to persevere - in the woods - in the marsh - underground. Perhaps I was just susceptible to its theme because I'd recently started my own ant farm - the learning tool that's handed out to the students in this film and that serves as omen and metaphor.However the pace of the action also appealed to me. This isn't a shock-a-minute supernatural thriller. It stays low-key, at least through its first half. But we know something is afoot, from the prints on the floor, from that glint of menace scrambling up the roof.Kevin Costner does a wonderful, wondering job as he senses his daughter's transformation. This film does have something of a goofy, contrived ending, but it's as much about a father's relationship with his children as it is about delivering chills. Overall, I'm surprised that ""Daughter"" got such short shrift in the theaters and went so fast to DVD. It deserved better.The photography is seductive, lucid - not murky as it is in so many recent over-filtered films. A lot of the scenes were shot on location in South Carolina, on the grounds of and in a lovely historic house. Unfortunately, the film projects on the TV screen in an especially narrow letterbox format. People's legs and heads tend to get cut off. Sometimes the Director did this intentionally; sometimes the amputations seem to be the result of this ribbon-like formatting. Either way, it can be irritating.Director Luis Berdejo gives a commentary that's worthwhile, but occasionally a little hard to understand because of his accent. He points out turns of the plot that I'd only vaguely grasped. Some of the pains he talks about taking with the filming do seem to have been a bit arty and unnecessary. For example, he tells how he assiduously avoided having any spot of red show up in the film - until the first drop of blood appears. Towards this end, he even made a red stoplight remain permanently yellow. He wanted to make that first drop of blood maximally riveting and portentous. I think such efforts might have gone to waste because it's unlikely viewers will even subconsciously be aware that they are seeing blood-red for the first time when it happens. But it's interesting to know what Berdejo was striving towards.Be aware though - this commentary is hidden under ""Set-Up"" on the DVD. At least it was on the issue I got. It doesn't appear where you would expect, under ""Extras."" I would have missed it but for the fluke of accidentally hitting ""Set-Up."" I wonder how many other DVD's have interesting bonus material hidden in unexpected places? So be sure to hunt for extras in odd places here and on other DVDs.There are some other extras in their right place under ""Extras"" on the DVD. These include a ""Making of..."" feature and a host of deleted scenes. The viewer will briefly be introduced to John Connolly, the author of the work on which this film is based. Connolly comes across as a literate, innovative thinker. His comments here have inspired me to check out his other writings.",4,You Can't Get Rid of THEM...,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,3095,"['movie', 'kept', 'interested', 'taut', 'start', 'when', 'established', 'eerie', 'sense', 'nature', 'drive', 'persevere', 'woods', 'marsh', 'underground', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'susceptible', 'theme', ""'d"", 'recently', 'started', 'own', 'ant', 'farm', 'learning', 'tool', 'handed', 'out', 'students', 'film', 'omen', 'metaphor.However', 'pace', 'action', 'also', 'appealed', ""n't"", 'shock-a-minute', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'low-key', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'know', 'something', 'afoot', 'prints', 'floor', 'glint', 'menace', 'scrambling', 'up', 'roof.Kevin', 'Costner', 'wonderful', 'wondering', 'job', 'daughter', 'transformation', 'film', 'have', 'something', 'goofy', 'contrived', 'ending', 'as', 'much', 'father', 'relationship', 'children', 'delivering', 'chills', 'Overall', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Daughter', 'got', 'such', 'short', 'shrift', 'theaters', 'went', 'so', 'fast', 'DVD', 'deserved', 'better.The', 'photography', 'seductive', 'lucid', 'not', 'murky', 'so', 'many', 'recent', 'over-filtered', 'films', 'lot', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'location', 'South', 'Carolina', 'grounds', 'lovely', 'historic', 'house', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'projects', 'TV', 'screen', 'especially', 'narrow', 'letterbox', 'format', 'People', 'legs', 'heads', 'tend', 'get', 'cut', 'off', 'Sometimes', 'Director', 'did', 'intentionally', 'amputations', 'seem', 'be', 'result', 'ribbon-like', 'formatting', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'irritating.Director', 'Luis', 'Berdejo', 'commentary', 'worthwhile', 'occasionally', 'little', 'hard', 'understand', 'accent', 'out', 'turns', 'plot', ""'d"", 'only', 'vaguely', 'grasped', 'pains', 'taking', 'filming', 'do', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'arty', 'unnecessary', 'example', 'how', 'assiduously', 'avoided', 'having', 'spot', 'red', 'show', 'up', 'film', 'first', 'drop', 'blood', 'Towards', 'end', 'even', 'made', 'red', 'stoplight', 'remain', 'permanently', 'yellow', 'wanted', 'make', 'first', 'drop', 'blood', 'maximally', 'riveting', 'portentous', 'think', 'such', 'efforts', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'waste', 'unlikely', 'viewers', 'will', 'even', 'subconsciously', 'be', 'aware', 'are', 'seeing', 'blood-red', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'interesting', 'know', 'what', 'Berdejo', 'was', 'striving', 'towards.Be', 'aware', 'commentary', 'hidden', 'Set-Up', 'DVD', 'least', 'was', 'issue', 'got', ""n't"", 'appear', 'where', 'would', 'expect', 'Extras', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'fluke', 'accidentally', 'hitting', 'Set-Up', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'DVD', 'have', 'interesting', 'bonus', 'material', 'hidden', 'unexpected', 'places', 'So', 'be', 'sure', 'hunt', 'extras', 'odd', 'places', 'here', 'other', 'DVDs.There', 'are', 'other', 'extras', 'right', 'place', 'Extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'Making', 'feature', 'host', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'will', 'briefly', 'be', 'introduced', 'John', 'Connolly', 'author', 'work', 'film', 'based', 'Connolly', 'across', 'literate', 'innovative', 'thinker', 'comments', 'here', 'have', 'inspired', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'writings']",N/A

1333080,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B0038RSIEW,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","When a big name actor headlines a movie that goes direct to video, that's generally a bad sign. That's certainly the case in ""The New Daughter,"" one of Kevin Costner's least auspicious movies. Surprisingly, ""Daughter"" isn't terrible, it's merely a lethargic, slackly paced film that tries to be too many things and succeeds at none.Costner plays a recently divorced dad whose wife has dumped the kids off on him. He moves to a secluded house somewhere in the woods in South Carolina that has its very own burial mound on the property. At first, his middle school daughter (Spanish actress Ivana Baquero) is merely teenage sullen, but, as the movie progresses, she starts acting more and more strange, wandering off in the woods to hang out near the burial mound. Costner grows increasingly flustered as he gradually realizes that the daughter's problem isn't of the usual coming-of-age variety but of a most supernatural variety. In fact, the daughter's downward spiral mirrors that of the previous owner of the house who had a similarly aged daughter who died shortly before Costner bought the house.A good director could have made this movie into a suspenseful guessing game, but Luis Berdejo, making his English language debut, simply draws the film out about fifteen minutes longer than it should be. To his credit, Costner doesn't phone in a performance and he is quite good at playing bewildered. One wishes that the film had opted for go in a more realistic direction, because he and Baquero play off each other well. In fact, the best scenes in the film are those showing Costner trying to cope with having to work at being a parent for the first time (a sequence when he tries to use google to get pop psychology advice on dealing with a teenage daughter is quite funny).However, Berdejo has monsters on the mind, specifically creatures that have lived in the mound for centuries and want Baquero as their new queen. This isn't really a spoiler since he ruins any suspense the film might have had by showing one of the creatures in a very early scene. Since the movie is PG-13 rated, the creatures don't look all that scary (more like Gollum with about a hundred pointy teeth), and they don't fare too well when Costner faces them down with a shotgun. Both the horror aspects of the film and the general creepiness of having a plot revolve around a 13-year-old girl's sexuality would have been better served if Bardejo had the freedom an R-rated film would have allowed.No one plays stoic middle class decency like Kevin Costner and his presence gives the movie what limited success it has. Unfortunately, not even Costner can make crawling through underground tunnels looking for his daughter exciting. Instead of effective domestic drama or even luridly effective domestic melodrama, we get something that, with a slightly lower budget, David Hasselhoff might have made on the Sy Fy Channel.Fortunately for Costner, his career took a turn for the better shortly afterwards when he landed his Emmy-winning role in ""The Hatfields and McCoys.""  Viewers who sit through the DVD's extra features (a director's commentary and a ten-minute ""making of"" featurette) won't be as fortunate. Director Bardejo isn't all that expressive or easy to understand in English and his commentary varies between patting Costner and the other actors on the back and explaining why he staged certain scenes as he did. Considering how the film turned out, aspiring film makers would be well advised not to follow his thought processes in that regard.",2,Nothing New About This One,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,3536,"['When', 'big', 'name', 'actor', 'movie', 'direct', 'video', 'generally', 'bad', 'sign', 'certainly', 'case', 'New', 'Daughter', 'one', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'least', 'auspicious', 'movies', 'Surprisingly', 'Daughter', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'merely', 'lethargic', 'slackly', 'paced', 'film', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'none.Costner', 'recently', 'divorced', 'dad', 'wife', 'dumped', 'kids', 'off', 'secluded', 'house', 'somewhere', 'woods', 'South', 'Carolina', 'very', 'own', 'burial', 'mound', 'property', 'first', 'middle', 'school', 'daughter', 'Spanish', 'actress', 'Ivana', 'Baquero', 'merely', 'teenage', 'sullen', 'movie', 'acting', 'more', 'more', 'strange', 'wandering', 'off', 'woods', 'hang', 'out', 'burial', 'mound', 'Costner', 'increasingly', 'flustered', 'gradually', 'daughter', 'problem', ""n't"", 'usual', 'coming-of-age', 'variety', 'most', 'supernatural', 'variety', 'fact', 'daughter', 'downward', 'spiral', 'mirrors', 'previous', 'owner', 'house', 'who', 'had', 'similarly', 'aged', 'daughter', 'who', 'died', 'shortly', 'Costner', 'bought', 'house.A', 'good', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'suspenseful', 'guessing', 'game', 'Luis', 'Berdejo', 'making', 'English', 'language', 'debut', 'simply', 'film', 'out', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'longer', 'should', 'be', 'credit', 'Costner', ""n't"", 'phone', 'performance', 'quite', 'good', 'playing', 'bewildered', 'One', 'film', 'had', 'opted', 'go', 'more', 'realistic', 'direction', 'Baquero', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'well', 'fact', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'showing', 'Costner', 'trying', 'cope', 'having', 'work', 'being', 'parent', 'first', 'time', 'sequence', 'when', 'use', 'google', 'get', 'pop', 'psychology', 'advice', 'dealing', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'quite', 'funny', '.However', 'Berdejo', 'monsters', 'mind', 'specifically', 'have', 'lived', 'mound', 'centuries', 'want', 'Baquero', 'new', 'queen', ""n't"", 'really', 'spoiler', 'suspense', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'showing', 'one', 'creatures', 'very', 'early', 'scene', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'creatures', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'scary', 'more', 'Gollum', 'hundred', 'pointy', 'teeth', 'do', ""n't"", 'fare', 'too', 'well', 'when', 'Costner', 'down', 'shotgun', 'horror', 'aspects', 'film', 'general', 'creepiness', 'having', 'plot', 'revolve', '13-year-old', 'girl', 'sexuality', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'Bardejo', 'had', 'freedom', 'R-rated', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'allowed.No', 'one', 'stoic', 'middle', 'class', 'decency', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'presence', 'movie', 'what', 'limited', 'success', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'even', 'Costner', 'can', 'make', 'crawling', 'underground', 'tunnels', 'looking', 'daughter', 'exciting', 'Instead', 'effective', 'domestic', 'drama', 'even', 'luridly', 'effective', 'domestic', 'melodrama', 'get', 'something', 'slightly', 'lower', 'budget', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'Sy', 'Fy', 'Channel.Fortunately', 'Costner', 'career', 'took', 'turn', 'better', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'when', 'landed', 'Emmy-winning', 'role', 'Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'Viewers', 'who', 'sit', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'director', 'commentary', 'ten-minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'fortunate', 'Director', 'Bardejo', ""n't"", 'expressive', 'easy', 'understand', 'English', 'commentary', 'varies', 'patting', 'Costner', 'other', 'actors', 'back', 'explaining', 'why', 'staged', 'certain', 'scenes', 'did', 'Considering', 'how', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'aspiring', 'film', 'makers', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'advised', 'not', 'follow', 'thought', 'regard']",N/A

A man moves his two children to an old house in the country where there is a strange Native American burial mound nearby. The man and his son eschew the mound but his daughter has an unexplained attraction to it. Eventually we learn there are creatures, called Mound Walkers, who are planning to use the daughter as their queen, not a bad premise for a horror story at all. Stephen King did very well with a similar story, ""Pet Sematary"", and I was all set to enjoy a good little thriller. However the ending was so ambiguous my mouth literally dropped open. A plot must have a beginning, middle and end, so said Aristotle. This is obviously too difficult a concept for director Luiso Berdejo to grasp, who claims to have left the ending purposely vague so that the viewer could come to his own conclusion. Sorry, but when the story is over it's over. What the viewer walks away with is supposed to be a complete tale not one with the beginning, middle and---""are you freaking kidding?""(my words). The viewer has a right to watch a story with all three elements in place. This is not ""The Lady or the Tiger"" or ""The Monkey's Paw"", stories where an ambiguous ending is the key.

The end makes no sense, you get no answers as to why anything happened, and you're left thinking ""huh"" and then the credits roll.Basically a father (Costner) and his 2 kids, a young son and teen daughter move into a new place. There's some weird mound on the property that only the daughter seems to want to check out and hang out at. As the movie continues, she seems drawn there and starts changing. Her look changes, personality changes, and she just gets weird. It's all somehow connected to this mound on their property which we later get the backstory of.Ok so things move along and start getting more intense.

O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","The New Daughter looks at first glance like it's going to be a mainstream, somewhat suspenseful thriller, possibly with supernatural overtones.  It flies miles past those expectations, however, quickly revealing itself as an original, multi-layered fright fest that's required viewing for horror and suspense fans.The movie starts off ordinarily enough, the kind of opening that's launched a slew of films, some good, some bad.  Newly single father John (Kevin Costner) moves with his two children, Louisa (Ivana Baquero fromPan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)) and Sam (Gatlin Griffin) to a big house near a small town.  There, the group has trouble adjusting - John's wife was formerly the primary caregiver and John's having a difficult time taking over 'sole parent' duties, and Louisa is deeply unhappy and rather rebellious after having been moved across the country.  Meanwhile, small hints surface that there may be something 'not right' with the new house or its history.  Even in these preliminary stages the movie is effective due to strong performances, strong characterization, and just plain skilled filmmaking.  The New Daughter is the kind of movie that manages to make the most mundane of the 'everyday' scenes interesting, and it starts building an effective atmosphere well before it really starts turning that atmosphere dark, eerie and threatening.There's a large hill near the house that looks man-made, which turns out to be an ancient burial mound, that both the children are fascinated by, especially Louisa.  As she starts spending more time near the mound, her personality begins altering.  At this point viewers will probably think they know where it's going but, like I was, may find themselves surprised.  For well past the first half of the movie, even as it's getting better and better, it's still giving no real clue as to what horrors it's about to evolve into, as the kind of scares start to appear that make you forget to breathe.For the bulk of the movie, much of the horror takes place offscreen, but not to the extent where it leaves you with too little concrete.  Leaving lots of stuff open to the imagination can be highly effective; leaving Everything to the imagination and a movie can tame itself into oblivion.  And then, of course, there's that final fifteen minutes or so, where the subtlty starts to crack  and you see what's really going on.Some viewers have apparently found this movie too slow.  I disagree, and feel there's not a wasted moment in here.  I love the faster-paced, full-out horror likeFreddy vs. Jason (New Line Platinum Series)and30 Days of Nightas much as anyone, but I also love the more atmospheric, suspense-oriented stuff.  If you're into ones likeA Tale of Two Sisters (Two-Discs),The Orphanage, andThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)you're going to enjoy New Daughter too.

The story kept my interest all the way through until the end.  And, wow, what an ending! Started out with sort of a super-natural story-line and ended up as a horror. Slow-paced at first, but then progresses to a faster heart-pounding pace at the end.  If you are a horror fan, I think you will like this movie.  Others may criticize Costner for taking on this role.  This film is erie and suspenseful.  As for the ending - well, see it and you be the judge.May - 2011 Just watched it again and still loved it!

1333090,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0038RSIEW,trebe,"[0, 0]","Featuring a strange supernatural threat, The New Daughter (2009) is a slow burning thriller that provides a few creepy moments, as Kevin Costner's performance as a confused father is strong and pretty realistic, but in the end, the story just doesn't quite manage to pull all the threads together in a very satisfying way.Costner is John James, a newly divorced author, who has just moved to a new town in South Carolina, with his 14 year old daughter Louisa (Ivana Baquero), and young son Sam (Gattlin Griffith).  The family is living in a house in the country, where unknown to James, strange events have taken place.  On the property is a large burial mound, that becomes Louisa's favorite place to hang out.  Exactly what happens there isn't revealed, but Louisa begins to behave strangely, and have problems at school, which brings teacher Cassandra Parker (Samantha Mathis) into the picture.James discovers that the previous owner of his house was a woman who mysteriously disappeared, and whose daughter later died in a fire.  James hires a babysitter for the children, and heads off to a nearby town to investigate further.  While is he away, the babysitter vanishes, and James is taken into custody by the police.  While on his way home, strange creatures from the mound strike, putting James into a panic, as he attempts to save his family.The film does a good job of exploring the dynamics of the family, as well as the relationship between James and the eager to help Cassandra.  It's obvious that something bad has happened to Louisa, and this holds your interest for a time, but although the atmosphere is a little ominous and creepy, not much really happens until the very end, where things get a bit extreme.  The many deleted scenes, indicate how the story could have been fleshed out further, however with a couple of exceptions, the additions may not have improved the overall flow of the film too much.  The premise is workable and kind of interesting, but with the limitations of a PG13 rating, the creatures do little that is graphic or nasty onscreen.Costner's performance is credible and enjoyable, although it seems odd that James doesn't try to call for help, instead of attempting to be a hero.  Ivana Baquero (Pan's Labyrinth)) gives a nice low key performance, and Gattlin Griffith (The Changeling]) is pretty good, as a kind of annoying kid who seems to be scared of everything.  Samantha Mathis (Broken Arrow]) is very solid, although the choice of her hair color might not have been ideal.Well-known for being the writer of the Rec and Quarantine films, Luiso Berdejo competently directs his first American production.  With some pieces that don't quite fit, The New Daughter doesn't play out as smoothly as it might, and an ambiguous ending just puts a topper on what is not an entirely satisfying experience.  The emphasis on the family setting, kind of gives the production a cable TV vibe, and the movie will probably have more of an appeal to that kind of audience, rather than those looking for a more action heavy creature feature.",3,a mildly creepy tale that doesn't quite satisfy...,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,3070,"['Featuring', 'strange', 'supernatural', 'threat', 'New', 'Daughter', '2009', 'slow', 'burning', 'thriller', 'few', 'creepy', 'moments', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'performance', 'confused', 'father', 'strong', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'end', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'pull', 'threads', 'together', 'very', 'satisfying', 'way.Costner', 'John', 'James', 'newly', 'divorced', 'author', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'new', 'town', 'South', 'Carolina', '14', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Louisa', 'Ivana', 'Baquero', 'young', 'son', 'Sam', 'Gattlin', 'Griffith', 'family', 'living', 'house', 'country', 'where', 'unknown', 'James', 'strange', 'events', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'property', 'large', 'burial', 'mound', 'Louisa', 'favorite', 'place', 'hang', 'out', 'Exactly', 'what', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'Louisa', 'behave', 'strangely', 'have', 'problems', 'school', 'teacher', 'Cassandra', 'Parker', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'picture.James', 'discovers', 'previous', 'owner', 'house', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'daughter', 'later', 'died', 'fire', 'James', 'babysitter', 'children', 'heads', 'nearby', 'town', 'investigate', 'further', 'away', 'babysitter', 'vanishes', 'James', 'taken', 'custody', 'police', 'way', 'home', 'strange', 'creatures', 'mound', 'strike', 'putting', 'James', 'panic', 'save', 'family.The', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'exploring', 'dynamics', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'James', 'eager', 'help', 'Cassandra', 'obvious', 'something', 'bad', 'happened', 'Louisa', 'interest', 'time', 'atmosphere', 'little', 'ominous', 'creepy', 'not', 'much', 'really', 'very', 'end', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'extreme', 'many', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'indicate', 'how', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'further', 'however', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'additions', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'improved', 'overall', 'flow', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'premise', 'workable', 'kind', 'interesting', 'limitations', 'PG13', 'rating', 'creatures', 'do', 'little', 'graphic', 'nasty', 'onscreen.Costner', 'performance', 'credible', 'enjoyable', 'odd', 'James', ""n't"", 'try', 'call', 'help', 'instead', 'attempting', 'be', 'hero', 'Ivana', 'Baquero', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'nice', 'low', 'key', 'performance', 'Gattlin', 'Griffith', 'Changeling', ']', 'pretty', 'good', 'kind', 'annoying', 'kid', 'who', 'be', 'scared', 'everything', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'Broken', 'Arrow', ']', 'very', 'solid', 'choice', 'hair', 'color', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'ideal.Well-known', 'being', 'writer', 'Rec', 'Quarantine', 'films', 'Luiso', 'Berdejo', 'competently', 'first', 'American', 'production', 'pieces', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'New', 'Daughter', ""n't"", 'play', 'out', 'as', 'smoothly', 'might', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'just', 'topper', 'what', 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'emphasis', 'family', 'setting', 'kind', 'production', 'cable', 'TV', 'vibe', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'more', 'appeal', 'kind', 'audience', 'rather', 'looking', 'more', 'action', 'heavy', 'creature', 'feature']",N/A

The story relies too much on conventions of thrillers with a haunted house theme, taking too much time on suggesting what is obvious to most viewers.

To a house that has a checkered and horrifying past, needless to say until he strolls into town one day to pick up some groceries at the store, he doesnt realize this. Who does? Alas! His young teenage daughter that is having problems with him and her mother parting ways or basically her mother just abandoning them and leaving them to someone who has never really been a father to her. So as he notices, very gradually the daughter starts to change, and i must point out its so gradual in the sense you don't even see it. The girl acts fine, comes from out side covered in mud, sits around, doesnt talk, has no appetite, but then all of a sudden is eating like a pig? Uhh ok. I was expecting more along the lines of hurting her fellow students, her dad, teachers or even little brother, this did not happen. Most of the movie is just slow paced with some scary sounds and an a giant ancient indian burial ground which she plays on in the back yard. Make any sense yet? Well even when you watch it and start getting up to the conclusion your just left wondering ok why am i watching this again? Until the last 20 minutes or so of the film you really don't see much of anything, sure the babysitter goes outside as Kevin Costner ventures off the find the owner and question him and she dies a horrible death, that isn't shown but heard, but thats about it. Well after endlessly enduring the mundane progression of this film you finally get to see some action, well sort of. There are things, which is all i'll say for now that come after them in the house, Kevin Costner buried a shot gun they found in the piano (then digs it up)because his son found it and really did no harm but at any rate just hide it from the kid in the cellar or something. So on we go the things come after them trying to ""claim"" the girl for certain purposes, explained, but not very well. The only thing your really left with is that the girl is some kind of queen, they chose her because she was young and available i'm guessing. So in the finale' you just really end up getting that when you find out whats going on you really don't know why. Kevin Costners roll is very well played out and it would be nice to see him in a ""real"" horror film. So finally at the end your left with a bitter taste in your mouth not only from ""how"" it ends but also the fact that you waited nearly two hours for it to end this way. So if you like a made for TV horror film you'll love it, otherwise just pass, i'll admit there are some genuinely creepy sounds and moments, but nothing to save the movie from a disasterous plot, and storyline. So rent it don't buy it, its barely worth watching once.I'll add that the things you see are very well made but should have been shown much earlier in the film, M.Night Shamaylon would be proud though.",2,"Pretttty bad, i've seen worse but not much.",1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,2897,"['Well', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'out', 'wayward', 'divorcee', 'kids', 'oddly', 'enough', 'where', 'house', 'checkered', 'horrifying', 'past', 'needless', 'say', 'town', 'one', 'day', 'pick', 'up', 'groceries', 'store', 'realize', 'Who', 'Alas', 'young', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'having', 'problems', 'mother', 'parting', 'ways', 'basically', 'mother', 'just', 'abandoning', 'leaving', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'father', 'So', 'very', 'gradually', 'daughter', 'change', 'i', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'so', 'gradual', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'girl', 'acts', 'fine', 'side', 'covered', 'mud', 'around', 'doesnt', 'talk', 'appetite', 'then', 'sudden', 'eating', 'pig', 'Uhh', 'ok', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'lines', 'hurting', 'fellow', 'students', 'dad', 'teachers', 'even', 'little', 'brother', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'Most', 'movie', 'just', 'slow', 'paced', 'scary', 'sounds', 'giant', 'ancient', 'indian', 'burial', 'ground', 'back', 'yard', 'Make', 'sense', 'yet', 'Well', 'even', 'when', 'watch', 'start', 'getting', 'up', 'conclusion', 'just', 'left', 'wondering', 'ok', 'why', 'am', 'i', 'watching', 'again', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'anything', 'sure', 'babysitter', 'outside', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'ventures', 'find', 'owner', 'question', 'horrible', 'death', ""n't"", 'shown', 'heard', 'Well', 'endlessly', 'enduring', 'mundane', 'progression', 'film', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'action', 'well', 'sort', 'are', 'things', 'i', ""'ll"", 'say', 'now', 'come', 'house', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'buried', 'shot', 'gun', 'found', 'piano', 'then', 'up', 'son', 'found', 'really', 'did', 'harm', 'rate', 'just', 'hide', 'kid', 'cellar', 'something', 'So', 'go', 'things', 'come', 'trying', 'claim', 'girl', 'certain', 'purposes', 'explained', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'left', 'girl', 'kind', 'queen', 'chose', 'was', 'young', 'available', 'i', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'So', 'finale', 'just', 'really', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'whats', 'going', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Kevin', 'Costners', 'roll', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'real', 'horror', 'film', 'So', 'finally', 'end', 'left', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'also', 'fact', 'waited', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'end', 'way', 'So', 'like', 'made', 'TV', 'horror', 'film', ""'ll"", 'love', 'otherwise', 'just', 'pass', 'i', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'are', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'sounds', 'moments', 'nothing', 'save', 'movie', 'disasterous', 'plot', 'storyline', 'rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'barely', 'worth', 'watching', 'once.I', ""'ll"", 'add', 'things', 'see', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'much', 'earlier', 'film', 'M.Night', 'Shamaylon', 'would', 'be', 'proud']",N/A

Yes, this film is NOT like most of the present day horror movies which rely on graphic violence, sexy characters who all appear to lack common sense, predictable and weak storylines, and tons of special effects, yet is better for it as it relys on a deliberate pace which requires the audience to pay attention, suspense, an ever increasing sense of dread for the inevitability of the outcome, and good performances from the cast especially the two kids and Costner as the father.The film deliberately eschews modern styles such as the bleached out look, over loud music that telegraphs how we must react, and fast cutting.  It embraces a 70's style approach and the earlier slow pace is absolutely right for this film and in no way should put off the viewer as it all pays off in the second half.Give this film a chance - you might be surprised.The blu-ray disc  replicates the rich colour palette and the warm tones of South Carolina accurately and I recommend the viewer to listen to the uncompressed pcm track which is better than the Dolby track.
