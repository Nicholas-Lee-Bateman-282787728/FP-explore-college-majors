Which probably explains my love of this film-it's a reprisal of my favorite Hopper-the menacing, frightfully sinister one-much like his role in ""Blue Velvet"" (the only saving grace in that film, IMO). If you're not a big fan of his, then I, quite honestly, don't recommend ""Paris Trout."" Others might find it or ""too depressing"" or even ""unsettling"". I tend to enjoy movies that that masses either find too offbeat or not uplifting enough. This is a movie about a man who doesn't adhere to societal mores in the deep south and how that affects those who are unfortunate enough to cross his path.

Here's a bigger oddity: nary a profane word spoken by either Hopper or Harris in this movie!There also is very little violence. However, when it occurs, it is shocking. Hopper plays his normal evil person and is convincing, as always. The film is fascinating for the first half but then bogs down with the romance between Hershey and Harris. It picks up again at the end.The scenery here of the rural South of the 1940s is very pretty. This is an odd film; almost hard to classify, but certainly worth a look. It's not a well-known film, as you can see by the amount of reviews.

It falls somewhere in the middle.Plot (Spoilers to follow): An altercation between a racist white man and a black boy about the ownership of a damaged vehicle prompts the white man to kill the boy's mother and sister.Pros:Dennis Hopper's character as Paris Trout is probably the most fleshed out character in the movie. The movie main selling point basically is this bigot's journey into madness and self-destruction and to that Dennis Hopper does it like the veteran he is.Cons:*Predictable ending*The other characters are one dimensional and weak*The ending itself leaves you a bit unsatisfied.Barbara Hershey is a great actress but her character is so one dimensional it's almost annoying. Hanna Trout represents back then and even today the battered housewife, the housewife whose come to expect nothing from life except the misery of her husband.Ed Harris's character as Harry Seagraves is pretty much despite his handsome, heroic appearences not much better than Paris Trout. Here's a lawyer defending a murderer who he knows is guilty, has sex with his wife and well there's pretty much it.The story takes place in Georgia and well while I can go along with the fact that the law has in certain situations been corrupt, why is it that no one else confronts Paris? Certainly the character is so hateful and pitiful that I was awaiting for the moment when somebody takes revenge on him but it never happens. I realize Stephen Gyllenhaal's goal was to show an evil man getting away with murder but he could have made things more interesting which leads to my next point: This movie is way too long.This movie could have been cut down immensely like the court scenes which  serves no purpose especially when we learn how Paris gets away with murder.All in all it's an ok film, some might like others not. It's probably not the type of film you would watch again as there are other films like it.

But let me tell you that this criterion may shadow the possibility to watch one of the most potent and admirable performances in years of an enviable cast.Consider the Dennis Hopper's performance. I think Dennis has made through his career, six outstanding portraits: Hoosiers,The American friend,Blue Velvet, Black widow, True Romance and this one. Second argument Ed Harris as the implacable investigator is superb too. Third: Barbara Hershey makes a penetrating and brilliant acting as the sensitive wife of Hopper.Finally,the script by itself: we have a crude and terrible drama in the forties: Hopper plays a role of a convinced racist (and facist too, if you want)who considers the brutal murder means less tha nothing. His out of mind actions are so enrooted in the most stinking beliefs and prejuices.The sequence of the crime is plenty of high caliber realism and dramatic intensity that makes us to remind Parker's Mississippi burning, but the best is yet to come when the fury, rage and sick obsession becomes gradually in a true state mind, deeply neurotic and obsesive. His familiar relationship is just sinking; his progresive process isolation is told with superb handle camera.I recommend this work due its undeniable virtues.

Maybe now more people will discover its brilliance. Don't really have much to add to the existing reviews except two things:I almost feel that Hopper's lucky he was a long established actor and this wasn't his debut because Paris Trout is such a loathsome character, and Hopper was so effective in the role, that it could have been one of those cases where the disgust for the character bled over to the actor. He was that good.Also, I seem to remember there was some controversy over this film because, like Linda Fiorentino in ""The Last Seduction"", many wanted to give the film, and Hopper, Oscar nominations but Academy rules forbid it because, even though it did have a limited theatrical release, it was produced by and originally aired on cable (Showtime I think). Too bad because I have to wonder if Hopper would have won if he had of received a nomination for best actor.

493436,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000006B6A,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 7]","Produced in 1991, and based on the novel by Peter Dexter, this film which was produced for theaters but wound up on HBO, stars Dennis Hopper as a sadistic Southern bigot in the late 1940s.  Not only does he cruelly abuse his wife in a most humiliating way, he goes to the home of a poor black family to collect a debt and viciously shoots a woman several times and murders her 12-year old daughter.  His lawyer, played by Ed Harris, defends him at his trial but gradually becomes disgusted with his client and befriends and then romances Hopper's wife, played by Barbara Hershey.  Only tragedy can result from this; it is just a matter of how and when.All performances are excellent, especially that of Hopper, who again plays the perfect villain.  He's deranged and sinister, far beyond even the tolerated racism of the time, and his cruelty knows no bounds.  His performance sent chills down my spine, as I stayed glued to the small screen holding my breath as the story unfolded.  Darnita Henry played the role of the young girl with a combination of terror and innocence that endeared her to my heart.  I identified with her and mourned her death with a sense of revulsion at the casual way in which Dennis Hopper perceives it.  Tina Lifford, the young girl's mother who survives the attack, gives a fine performance as she testifies in court with a quiet dignity.  The audience knows the truth and then sees the horror of the twisted justice meted out at that time.  This film is sad, without a shred of humor or hope.  It is not a pleasant experience and left me upset and troubled.  But yet I recommend it to those not afraid of the emotional catharsis.
