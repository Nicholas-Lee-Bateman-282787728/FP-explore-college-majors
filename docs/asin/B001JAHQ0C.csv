They dont even get him downstairs before they ended the espoide.

The guy who was launched into a tree when his son tied off his line to the bumper of his wife's van.2. Gage and Desoto rescuing a guy off the observation tower at Ocean Lab Park (i.e. Marineland.3. A few episodes featuring Craig Brice.  One I recall is where Robert's Rules of Order and parliamentary procedures are used on a paramedic committee - Bob Belleveau, a real Los Angeles County paramedic, acts in this episode.4. An episode where Johnny and Roy are on a fishing/camping trip and help out a sheriff in a rural community.  This was a good depiction of bringing EMT's and paramedics out to rural areas, and the sheriff is motivated by Johnny and Roy to begin training a batch of EMT's.  (Remember -this was 1976).5. Another episode worth recalling is when heavy  rains washed out the roads in one of the canyon areas of Los Angeles County.  Johnny and Roy end up at Fire Station 86 for a few days, and Station 86 becomes the family clinic.  They get standing orders via the biocom from Rampart.Look forward to seeing this.

DVDs since they started releasing them about 5 years ago, and I've been sorely disappointed by the picture and sound quality of the episodes on the DVDs during the last few seasons.  The prints appeared to be taken from 16MM prints (scratched and beat to hell, riddled with green lines and splices), and the audio was pretty muddy and scratchy.Well, I'm pleased to say that it appears Universal finally listened, because these Season 6 DVD prints look and sound amazing!  They have clearly gone and remastered these new digital transfers, possibly even in high definition, and the audio is crisp and clear.  My only quibble is that they have crammed 5 episodes to a disc for this 5-disc set, which is a bit much, but even so, it doesn't appear to have affected the stunning video and audio quality.The episodes themselves are entertaining as always;  this is one show that seemed to get better and more interesting with each season.  There's lots of great character interaction, the rescues are very exciting and well-staged, and there's a new face in the firehouse this season--that of a basset hound who makes the station's couch his home.  It's nice to see a show go out at the top of its game writing-wise, and as everyone knows, this was Emergency's final season (to be followed by a series of TV movies, which Universal is supposedly going to release as well).I highly recommend Season 6 both in terms of DVD quality and the show's content!

We screamed bloody murder to Universal when season three was released, and they gave us all crappy versions when it came to seasons 4 and 5, I thought to myself , knowing our luck , they would have finally give us proper versions when it comes to season six, well guess what folks? unbelieveable! all the episodes from this release of season six are restored beautifully sound and picture quality looks fantastic, so why am I still complaining you ask? Why couldn't they have done this when we asked them to fix seasons four and five? Now will they go back and restore and rerelease the previous seasons with original openeing themes? one can hope , so it's obvious that universal had listened to us eventually, too bad it took them long enough.

Yet it contained some good episodes...three of them prominently featured Michael Norell (otherwise known as Captain Stanley)!Norell had quite a flair for slapstick comedy which resulted in three very funny episodes: Insanity Epidemic,  Hypochondri Cap, and Upward and Onward.  Welcome to Santa Rosa County also was well-written and stressed the need for good medical care in a remote area.  Humor seemed to be prevalent in several other episodes....this seasonshowed stories on the lighter side of life, and showed more interaction between the staff of Station 51!  If I had any reservations, it would be that the season ended without any closure......and suddenly there was the movie, The Final Rescues, and Gage and DeSoto were promoted to Captains.  How did the transition happen....we never found out!  They were Paramedics and then they were Captains!  The crew at 51 vanished...only to be seen in flashbacks.  What an opportunity was missed when a whole possible storyline was never produced.  Very sad!  The same thing happened with the Pilot film....except Station 51 was introduced....but hurriedly with very little tranistion as well!This is common.....events happen and one never sees how it all started and never saw the develpment of the story.  I liked the crew at 51 and thought they worked well suppementing the major stars....especially Mike Stoker who gained more ease with his lines and performance as the series progressed.  He had less performance time because he, being an actual firefighter, was often on duty during filming.  I was happy to see his presence increased with time and he was given more spoken lines.That I liked the series is evident.....not every episode though!  Randy Mantooth once said,""this was the little show that wouldn't die"".  It worked....despite contrivance, technical errors, silliness, and cost-cutting.
