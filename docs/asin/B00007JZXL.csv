Jean Arthur, as always, is delightful as a city gal that decides to escape her three annoying suitors by taking a bus trip out West. There she accidentally meets John Wayne while taking pictures at a rodeo. Wayne is very low-key but effective in his role as an old fashioned western rodeo rider who eventually falls for Jean Arthur though he keeps telling himself that he's not cut out for marriage. The romantic chemistry bewteen Wayne and Arthur, though not as magical as that with Jimmy Stewart in the Frank Capra classics Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and You Can't Take it With You, is nonetheless very nice.Phil Silvers, in a very early role, adds some nice comedy as the overbearing tour guide on the bus.Overall, a very entertaining romantic comedy that works well and is another reminder of how Hollywood used to make movies before immorality and profanity took hold in the late 1950's and 60's.

The script is fairly minimal, and many scenes even seem improvised, but what's remarkable is the underlying sexual frankness of the film -- the two meet by accident, and are inexorably drawn together by sheer sexual chemistry.  When they finally give in and go out on a real date, they have nothing to say to each other -- the attraction is purely physical.  Certain scenes, such as when he invites her up to his hotel room, offers her a drink, and bed to bunk in, are surprisingly raw, at least for the time.  Arthur and Wayne also seem to have chemistry together -- in fact, this is the only film in which I've seen him play opposite a gal when the sizzle seemed real...

729860,A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B00007JZXL,"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more...","[3, 3]","Molly Trousdale (Jean Arthur) is a big city girl with an awful lot going for her.  She evidently had a pretty good job and three guys (Malcom, Greg and Bob) vying for her affections.  But for Molly something is definitely missing.  Maybe that is why she has decided to embark on a two week vacation out West.  The poster at the bus station in her hometown of New York City promises ""Romance and Adventure:  14 Breathless Days In the West"".  And all for only $137.50.  Perhaps Molly thought that a change of scenery would do her some good.  But Molly Trousdale would get a whole lot more than she ever bargained for on this trip.  ""A Lady Takes A Chance"" is producer Frank Ross' (Jean Arthur's husband at the time) relatively obscure 1943 film that also stars John Wayne in a most unusual role as cowboy bachelor Duke Hutkins. This is a flick I had never even heard of until i came across it online just a few weeks ago.One of the stops on Molly's itinerary is a Championship rodeo.  She is quite taken by the sights and sounds of this event and is determined to get some great photos of her experience to share with the folks back home.  As she prepares to snap her next photo her subject is abruptly thrown from his animal and lands in the stands right on top of Molly!  A more unusual introduction you will never see and hilarious to boot!  Duke asks if the young lady is OK then tips his hat and jumps back into the ring.  But when the competition is over Molly goes out of her way to find Duke and asks him for his autograph as another momento of her trip.  He is more than happy to oblige and it quickly becomes apparent that Duke is quite smitten by the charming young lady from back East.  He had never met anyone quite like her.  Furthermore, it also becomes clear that the feeling is mutual when Duke asks Molly out for a drink and she confides ""nothing like this was included in my all expenses paid package.""  But Molly will quickly learn that Duke could be a handful. He is a confirmed bachelor and a man used to having his own way with the ladies.  Molly was having none of it.  Furthermore, Duke lies about the time and causes Molly to miss her tour bus.  It would appear that the two of them would have nothing more to discuss.But the simple fact of the matter was that Molly was a single girl in a strange town.  She had very few options open to her.  If she was lucky she could catch up with her bus for the return trip to New York in about a week.  Molly does her best to avoid Duke but it seems that destiny has other ideas.  She winds up hitching a ride with Duke and his trusty old sidekick Waco (Charles Winninger).  They are headed for a town called Gold City when they are forced to bed down for the night in the middle of the desert.  This would be an entirely new experience for the clueless city girl and when she got cold Molly steals the blanket off the back of Duke's beloved horse Sammy.  When the sun rose the next morning it was clear that Sammy was very sick and if pneumonia had set in he would have to be put down.  It would be touch and go all day long at the vets but the incident had a profound effect on Molly.  She tells Waco ""He is the most unusual fella I have ever met.  He certainly is the right fella for the right girl. Any fella who can love a horse can love a girl.""  Now Molly puts on a full court press to win her man.  She invites him to her cabin and cooks him a great dinner.  Everything is perfect and I was certain she was going to seal the deal.  But unfortunately this evening will not end the way Molly had hoped.  Still one gets the feeling that it is only a matter of time..........So there you have it.  ""A Lady Takes A Chance"" is a romantic comedy with a definite western flair.  There is magnificent chemistry between John Wayne and Jean Arthur that I simply never would have expected.  I am a huge Jean Arthur fan and she was great but John Wayne reveals a side of him in this film that I have never seen before.  I purchased this film a couple of weeks ago and have already watched it three times.  It is an unexpected treat.

729861,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00007JZXL,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","A Lady takes a Chance(released Aug/43)is a less than mediocre entry starring the Duke and the lovely Jean Arthur.That coupled with the abominable print presented here it makes this an easily passable film.The plot involves our Jean in New York on her way to somewhere out west,in need of a break.She has three suitors,one being old Roach Taxi Boy Grady Sutton and Hans Conried,the future Dr Tewilliger of the 5,000 fingers of Dr T and his myriad appearances and voice over work on television in the 50s and 60s.Arthur gets on the bus and heads west,young lady.It's a frustrating ride with disruptions by bratty kids and the uncomfortable sleeping arrangements.She arrives in this very western style town to witness a rodeo,which is part of the tour she is on.At one point she gets smacked down after the Duke,riding after a steer,ends up on top of Arthur while she tries to take a snap shot of him.Arthur is immediately smitten by the tall,lean and sexy Duke.In a restaurant later while they are drinking together she asks to feel his arms.Duke lives with his sidekick in the form of an old crusty Charles Winninger.The Duke is resistant to the whole romantic gig and the pair fall in and out with each other throughout the rest of the film.But you just know in these kinds of films that the girl always gets her man.Of course when she lands back in New York by herself we think all is lost,but in the good old fashioned spirit of such see through comedies,the Duke appears carrying Arthur back into the bus and into his life for good.This is a very poor outing for Arthur.The script finds her in more than one compromising position throughout the film,as there IS quite the sexual tension created between the two;quite racy actually for a film of this time.Arthur is certainly after some action as her love life back home is boring with a capital ""B"".And it is even more impactful because the majority of the ""push"" is coming from Arthur herself.The rest of the plot is pretty see through stuff we've seen dozens of times before and done much better than this.The Duke has little to do but act like a macho galoot,which he does as he has alot of wells,maybes and I don't knows to say.Besides this there is little in the movie to recommend it.This is a film that has gone public domain I know,but one should seek Arthur's other mid 40s release The Devil and Miss Jones for a great and classic Arthur film.It too went domain and was last restored and released by the UCLA archives on VHS.The technical side of this DVD is what is even more disappointing than the film itself.This DVD is like watching a bad VHS copy.It needs a total remastering as the film has many defects and the picture washes out very badly at times.This significantly drops the enjoyment factor by miles.I just recently reviewed TCM's release of Lon Chaney silent films and I can tell you unequivocally that those films are in far,far better shape than this one and they are 20s pictures.What a disappointment.All in all,for little to non existent picture quality to a poor script,despite the box office potential of its stars,give this DVD a pass,period.It's not worth your hard earned money at any price.",2,less than mediocre film with the Duke and Jean Arthur,1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,3177,"['Lady', 'Chance', 'released', 'Aug/43',

It's a fun light hearted comedy.  It's always fun to watch the ""Duke"" on the big screen.  He plays a traveling rodeo star and Jean Arthur is the sweet city gal that falls for the hunk.  Phil Silvers is great as the comic bus driver.  He spices things up a quite a bit.  To me it's a period piece and fun to listen to the dialog, look at the cars, and watch the old actors do their thing.The movie nut in Idaho",3,A Lady Takes a Chance,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,510,"['OK', 'movie', 'Not', 'great', 'worth', 'watching', 'heavy', 'plot', 'anything', 'thought', 'provoking', 'here', 'fun', 'light', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'Duke', 'big', 'screen', 'traveling', 'rodeo', 'star', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'sweet', 'city', 'gal', 'hunk', 'Phil', 'Silvers', 'great', 'comic', 'bus', 'driver', 'things', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'period', 'piece', 'fun', 'listen', 'dialog', 'look', 'cars', 'watch', 'old', 'actors', 'do', 'thing.The', 'movie', 'nut', 'Idaho']",N/A

Miss Arthur was one of the greatest actresses of the golden age of sound movies and John Wayne was, well, John Wayne  All this makes this film an entertaining movie that is a joy to watch and rewatch.

729866,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00007JZXL,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[7, 7]","A LADY TAKES A CHANCE stars Jean Arthur as Molly Truesdale, a young and hip Eastern American woman tired of all her suitors. To escape from them for a spell, she takes a bus-tour west to see America. While out west she literally bumps into Duke Hudkins (John Wayne) at a rodeo. They end up spending the rest of the day together and most of the evening and Molly ends up missing her bus.  Duke takes her to the city where she can catch it for the ride home.Though this is a pretty typical boy-meets-girl movie, there are a lot of elequant touches that make it stand out above the rest. Besides, it's enjoyable watching the Duke play a role so different from the ones he was to become famous for.  Jean Arthur is just adorable and makes a grand lady that is at first pursued, but then becomes the pursuer.  As a bonus, Phil Silvers has a small role as the bus tour guide.  Not only will Wayne fans and oldies fans like this movie, but it makes for a great date picture.",4,Classic Boy-Meets Girl With a Twist.,1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,967,"['LADY', 'TAKES', 'A', 'CHANCE', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Molly', 'Truesdale', 'young', 'hip', 'Eastern', 'American', 'woman', 'tired', 'suitors', 'escape', 'spell', 'bus-tour', 'west', 'see', 'America', 'out', 'west', 'literally', 'bumps', 'Duke', 'Hudkins', 'John', 'Wayne', 'rodeo', 'end', 'up', 'spending', 'rest', 'day', 'together', 'most', 'evening', 'Molly', 'up', 'missing', 'bus', 'Duke', 'city', 'where', 'can', 'catch', 'ride', 'pretty', 'typical', 'boy-meets-girl', 'movie', 'are', 'lot', 'elequant', 'touches', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'Duke', 'play', 'role', 'so', 'different', 'ones', 'was', 'become', 'famous', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'just', 'adorable', 'grand', 'lady', 'first', 'pursued', 'then', 'pursuer', 'bonus', 'Phil', 'Silvers', 'small', 'role', 'bus', 'tour', 'guide', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'Wayne', 'fans', 'oldies', 'fans', 'movie', 'great', 'date', 'picture']",N/A
