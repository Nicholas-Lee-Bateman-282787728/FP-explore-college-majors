1437264,A3UIBKQBKF0PKV,B0051QS1P4,"Jonathan Turbide ""The Investigator""","[14, 15]","Forensic Files is an American documentary-style series which reveals how forensic science is used to solve violent crimes, mysterious accidents, and even outbreaks of illness. The show takes a ""whodunit"" approach, making each case a mystery to be solved. Every 22 minutes episode follows one case from initial investigation until conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or sometimes even the suspects themselves are all interviewed about their roles.This set is about Serial Killers. All 12 investigations are very interesting. Here are the 12 episodes you'll find on this set:1. Calculated Coincidence: The suspect in a woman's rape and strangulation is linked to a six year old murder case of an exotic dancer in another state. Could investigators catch the killer?2. The Commom Thread: In 1984, a Florida serial killer was preying on woman. Red fibers were found on the victims' bodies, but a survivor provided information that would result in the capture of the perpetrator.3. Insignificant Others: As investigators explore details of the apparent suicide of a dentist's wife, another suice 14 years earlier lead investigators to look more closely at the possibility of a double homicide.4. Knot for Everyone: In the mid-1980s, bodies of nude woman were found in remote hill of California. The police got a brake when a known prostitute escaped an attacker and was able to identify him and his automobile.5. Penchant for Poison: One elderly woman with arsenic poisoning leads police to possible many victims. The only way to tell is to exume their bodies.6. Screen Pass: A young girl is abducted from her home while babysitting and eventually found murdered. Fingerprints left on a screen lead investigators to uncover the work of a seriel killer.7. Sign of the Zodiac: For six years, a serial killer prowled the streets of New York City, hunting his victims. He promised to kill 12 people, one for each astrological sign. And he only struck while certain constellations were visible. It took forensic astronomy, handwriting analysis, and a World War II code breaker to find him8. Sip of Sins: The Faryion Wardrip Serial Murder Case, where a sunday School Teacher, a valued employee with a happy family homelife, secretly fooled the police as being a serial killer.9. Southside Strangler: The case of Timothy Spencer is related. Dubbed the Southside Strangler, he was the first serial killer convicted on DNA evidence. During a three-month span during 1987, he raped and murdered three women in Richmond.10. Ties that Bind: A piece of rope holds the key to identifying a serial killer who has been preying on boys in Maine and Nebraska.11. Touch of Evil: The ""Last Call Killer"" targeted men in gay bars who drank heavily.  After killing and dismembering them, he carefully washed away the evidence.  He eluded capture for almost ten years, until new technology revealed fingerprints no one knew were there.12. Treads and Threads: An overview of the James Randall case. For 15 months in Florida, the alleged serial killer preyed on women, taunting police by leaving his victims' bodies in plain sight. The muddy imprint left by his truck, which used rare tires, eventually led investigators to him.",4,12 Interesting Cases ( Full Listing ),1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,3342,"['Forensic', 'Files', 'American', 'documentary-style', 'series', 'how', 'forensic', 'science', 'used', 'solve', 'violent', 'crimes', 'mysterious', 'accidents', 'even', 'outbreaks', 'illness', 'show', 'whodunit', 'approach', 'making', 'case', 'mystery', 'be', 'solved', '22', 'minutes', 'episode', 'one', 'case', 'initial', 'investigation', 'conviction', 'acquittal', 'other', 'legal', 'resolution', 'Pathologists', 'medical', 'examiners', 'police', 'officers', 'detectives', 'prosecutors', 'defense', 'attorneys', 'friends', 'families', 'victims', 'sometimes', 'even', 'suspects', 'are', 'interviewed', 'roles.This', 'set', 'Serial', 'Killers', '12', 'investigations', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'Here', 'are', '12', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'find', 'set:1', 'Calculated', 'Coincidence', 'suspect', 'woman', 'rape', 'strangulation', 'linked', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'murder', 'case', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'state', 'Could', 'investigators', 'catch', 'killer', '2', 'Commom', 'Thread', '1984', 'Florida', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'preying', 'woman', 'Red', 'fibers', 'were', 'found', 'victims', 'bodies', 'survivor', 'provided', 'information', 'would', 'result', 'capture', 'perpetrator.3', 'Insignificant', 'Others', 'investigators', 'explore', 'details', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'dentist', 'wife', 'suice', '14', 'years', 'earlier', 'lead', 'investigators', 'look', 'more', 'closely', 'possibility', 'double', 'homicide.4', 'Knot', 'Everyone', 'mid-1980s', 'bodies', 'nude', 'woman', 'were', 'found', 'remote', 'hill', 'California', 'police', 'got', 'brake', 'when', 'known', 'prostitute', 'escaped', 'attacker', 'was', 'able', 'identify', 'automobile.5', 'Penchant', 'Poison', 'One', 'elderly', 'woman', 'arsenic', 'poisoning', 'police', 'possible', 'many', 'victims', 'only', 'way', 'tell', 'exume', 'bodies.6', 'Screen', 'Pass', 'young', 'girl', 'abducted', 'home', 'babysitting', 'eventually', 'found', 'murdered', 'Fingerprints', 'left', 'screen', 'lead', 'investigators', 'uncover', 'work', 'seriel', 'killer.7', 'Sign', 'Zodiac', 'six', 'years', 'serial', 'killer', 'prowled', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'hunting', 'victims', 'promised', 'kill', '12', 'people', 'one', 'astrological', 'sign', 'only', 'struck', 'certain', 'constellations', 'were', 'visible', 'took', 'forensic', 'astronomy', 'handwriting', 'analysis', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'code', 'breaker', 'find', 'him8', 'Sip', 'Sins', 'Faryion', 'Wardrip', 'Serial', 'Murder', 'Case', 'where', 'sunday', 'School', 'Teacher', 'valued', 'employee', 'happy', 'family', 'homelife', 'secretly', 'fooled', 'police', 'being', 'serial', 'killer.9', 'Southside', 'Strangler', 'case', 'Timothy', 'Spencer', 'related', 'Dubbed', 'Southside', 'Strangler', 'was', 'first', 'serial', 'killer', 'convicted', 'DNA', 'evidence', 'three-month', 'span', '1987', 'raped', 'murdered', 'three', 'women', 'Richmond.10', 'Ties', 'Bind', 'piece', 'rope', 'key', 'identifying', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'been', 'preying', 'boys', 'Maine', 'Nebraska.11', 'Touch', 'Evil', 'Last', 'Call', 'Killer', 'targeted', 'men', 'gay', 'bars', 'who', 'drank', 'heavily', 'killing', 'dismembering', 'carefully', 'washed', 'away', 'evidence', 'eluded', 'capture', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'new', 'technology', 'revealed', 'fingerprints', 'one', 'knew', 'were', 'there.12', 'Treads', 'Threads', 'overview', 'James', 'Randall', 'case', '15', 'months', 'Florida', 'alleged', 'serial', 'killer', 'preyed', 'women', 'taunting', 'police', 'leaving', 'victims', 'bodies', 'plain', 'sight', 'muddy', 'imprint', 'left', 'truck', 'used', 'rare', 'tires', 'eventually', 'led', 'investigators']",Forensic Files: Serial Killers

Is an entertaing series, it deals with a number of different subjects, so you get quite a variety with this one. Some of these serial killers choose a certain type of person to go after. They may fancy atractive women, Or boys in an age group from 11 to 13 years of age. For an example, there were school boys doing their paper rounds, who never returned from their deliverys. Another case was a girl whos car broke down on a very isolated stretch of road late one night, her car was found, but she wasnt in it. And its very scarey to see how quickly a person can be snatched, without an eye witness seeing it. One serial killer after been caught, boasted that he had murderd 48 people. If his statement is correct, then that makes him the worst serial killer in history. An intertaining true murder series, which held my interest throughout.
