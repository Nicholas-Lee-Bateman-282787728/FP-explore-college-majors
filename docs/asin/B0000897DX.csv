736408,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0000897DX,Jason,"[1, 2]","This story is a basic one.  It's about the kids we all knew in school.  It's about the three or four schemers who would do anything to shirk responsibility and flout the rules as they cheated their way through classes.  If it wasn't a crib-sheet, it was writing on their hands.  Maybe it was getting to class early and writing on the desk.  We all knew that guy, and in this movie that guy is a master the likes of which we never experienced.Handsome Davis (Trevor Fehrman) is the leader of a foursome of cheating friends.  He's a charismatic figure who has been cheating with one friend, Sammy, since Kindergarten, and has picked up two accomplices in High School, Victor and Applebee (who writes crazy small).They are legendary at school, like Ferris Bueller, and everyone knows of their exploits.  But when the principal has a locksmith change the locks on every door in the school, the boys secret weapon, a duplicate janitor's key, becomes a paperweight.Before the boys move towards graduation, they will find that cheating on everything will require more than they had imagined.  They'll have to lie, steal, and trick people into helping them.  They'll also learn some harsh lessons about growing up along the way.  If it isn't tricking the foreign janitor, or coming up with a ridiculous story about a candy bar alibi, it's some other insane, wacky situation that the boys manage to wiggle out of like Houdini.  Watching Handsome play his Physics teacher, the principal, his friends, little kids, and even his own father is hilarious.  Fehrman nailed the role with his suave confidence and conniving leadership abilities, a persona that commands more attention than any school administrator, let alone any students who dares consider themselves a peer.For the final cheat alone, I think this movie is well worth it.  Even if the movie teaches an eventual lesson about the perils of cheating, it also happens to teach the viewer something serious, something beneficial.  The boys make wonderful use of audio mnemonics to pull off the greatest cheat of all time.  It's a great instructional tool for studying, and a technique that should be more widely used throughout academics.",4,"Crippled elves do dance around a devil covered by blue dress, dairy causes diarrhea, chunky, creamy, butter cheese",1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,2184,"['story', 'basic', 'one', 'kids', 'knew', 'school', 'three', 'four', 'schemers', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'shirk', 'responsibility', 'rules', 'cheated', 'way', 'classes', 'was', ""n't"", 'crib-sheet', 'was', 'writing', 'hands', 'Maybe', 'was', 'getting', 'class', 'early', 'writing', 'desk', 'knew', 'guy', 'movie', 'guy', 'master', 'likes', 'never', 'experienced.Handsome', 'Davis', 'Trevor', 'Fehrman', 'leader', 'foursome', 'cheating', 'friends', 'charismatic', 'figure', 'who', 'been', 'cheating', 'one', 'friend', 'Sammy', 'Kindergarten', 'picked', 'up', 'two', 'accomplices', 'High', 'School', 'Victor', 'Applebee', 'who', 'crazy', 'small', 'are', 'legendary', 'school', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'everyone', 'knows', 'exploits', 'when', 'principal', 'locksmith', 'change', 'locks', 'door', 'school', 'boys', 'secret', 'weapon', 'duplicate', 'janitor', 'key', 'paperweight.Before', 'boys', 'move', 'towards', 'graduation', 'will', 'find', 'cheating', 'everything', 'will', 'require', 'more', 'had', 'imagined', ""'ll"", 'have', 'lie', 'steal', 'trick', 'people', 'helping', ""'ll"", 'also', 'learn', 'harsh', 'lessons', 'growing', 'up', 'way', ""n't"", 'tricking', 'foreign', 'janitor', 'coming', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'story', 'candy', 'bar', 'alibi', 'other', 'insane', 'wacky', 'situation', 'boys', 'manage', 'wiggle', 'Houdini', 'Watching', 'Handsome', 'play', 'Physics', 'teacher', 'principal', 'friends', 'little', 'kids', 'even', 'own', 'father', 'hilarious', 'Fehrman', 'nailed', 'role', 'suave', 'confidence', 'conniving', 'leadership', 'abilities', 'persona', 'more', 'attention', 'school', 'administrator', 'let', 'alone', 'students', 'who', 'consider', 'peer.For', 'final', 'cheat', 'alone', 'think', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'Even', 'movie', 'eventual', 'lesson', 'perils', 'cheating', 'also', 'teach', 'viewer', 'something', 'serious', 'something', 'beneficial', 'boys', 'make', 'wonderful', 'use', 'audio', 'mnemonics', 'pull', 'off', 'greatest', 'cheat', 'time', 'great', 'instructional', 'tool', 'studying', 'technique', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'widely', 'used', 'academics']",N/A

I have no doubt that the cast was up to the challenge, but the solutions some of the characters used to get out of their situations were just stupid (&quot;I'll take the test RIGHT NOW!&quot; while ripping his shirt off?

While the DVD doesn't have many extras except a short film about the real Cheats who based the story on their life.The story goes like this: Handsome and his freinds are cheaters, they get into trouble when they stop cheating and conflict between the freinds grows. It is a funny comedy with no real meaning but it's definately gonna make you laugh.Bottomline: If you like old adam sandler movies (ie: happy gilmore &amp; billy madison) and enjoy a good comedy this is definately one you will like.",5,Cheats is no cheat of a movie,1049846400,"04 9, 2003",2003,594,"['movie', 'really', 'funny', 'packed', 'tons', 'funny', 'quotes', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'extras', 'short', 'film', 'real', 'Cheats', 'who', 'based', 'story', 'life.The', 'story', 'Handsome', 'freinds', 'are', 'cheaters', 'get', 'trouble', 'when', 'stop', 'cheating', 'conflict', 'freinds', 'funny', 'comedy', 'real', 'meaning', 'definately', 'gon', 'make', 'laugh.Bottomline', 'like', 'old', 'adam', 'sandler', 'movies', 'ie', 'happy', 'gilmore', 'amp', 'billy', 'madison', 'enjoy', 'good', 'comedy', 'definately', 'one', 'will', 'like']",N/A
