288884,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,6301982576,A. Gammill,"[7, 7]","Graffiti Bridge was largely ignored on its release in the fall of 1990.  And it's not hard to see why: It's horribly edited, rather horribly acted, and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Even die-hard Prince fans--myself among them--had a hard time supporting this one.The main problem is probably that Warner Bros. wanted a sequel to the mega-hit Purple Rain.  Prince apparently didn't want to make a sequel, but a fifties-style true musical.  Unfortunately, a linear sequel to Purple Rain and a fifties-style musical just can't co-exist in the same film.  Sure, it's got Prince as the Kid, Morris Day & Co., and a handful of references to the previous film.  But people break into song whether or not they're on stage, and (in the aforementioned horrible editing) the sounds don't always match the performers' movements.  The worst example of this is in Clinton's Club, when funky ol' George Clinton is singing ""We Can Funk""...the song is a duet with Prince on the soundtrack album, and you can HEAR Prince singing in the scene, but he's nowhere to be found.  And speaking of the soundtrack, some of the best cuts on the disc (released a good 6 months prior to the film's release) don't even appear in the film.So why do I even give it a generous 3 stars?  Well, I guess the thing kind of grows on ya after awhile.  It's all pretty lightweight stuff, despite Prince's patented pseudo-Christian imagery.  And the music that did make the cut is quite good, though Purple Rain fanatics will balk at the ""new jack"" sound that was all the rage in 1990.In short, this isn't going to win Prince any new fans.  But for those of us who still believe the Purple Wonder is about the best thing out there, Graffiti Bridge is a playful little curiosity that, in the end, really isn't so bad.Oh, and it's nice to have the 4 music videos, especially a rare live version of ""The Question of U.""",3,A guilty pleasure,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,1884,"['Graffiti', 'Bridge', 'was', 'largely', 'ignored', 'release', 'fall', '1990', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'horribly', 'edited', 'rather', 'horribly', 'acted', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'sense', 'Even', 'die-hard', 'Prince', 'fans', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'supporting', 'one.The', 'main', 'problem', 'probably', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'wanted', 'sequel', 'mega-hit', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'Prince', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'sequel', 'fifties-style', 'true', 'musical', 'Unfortunately', 'linear', 'sequel', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'fifties-style', 'musical', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'co-exist', 'same', 'film', 'Sure', 'got', 'Prince', 'Kid', 'Morris', 'Day', 'Co.', 'handful', 'references', 'previous', 'film', 'people', 'break', 'song', 'not', ""'re"", 'stage', 'aforementioned', 'horrible', 'editing', 'sounds', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'match', 'performers', 'movements', 'worst', 'example', 'Clinton', 'Club', 'when', 'funky', 'ol', 'George', 'Clinton', 'singing', 'Can', 'Funk', 'song', 'duet', 'Prince', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'can', 'HEAR', 'Prince', 'singing', 'scene', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'speaking', 'soundtrack', 'best', 'cuts', 'disc', 'released', 'good', '6', 'months', 'prior', 'film', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'film.So', 'why', 'do', 'even', 'give', 'generous', '3', 'stars', 'Well', 'guess', 'thing', 'kind', 'grows', 'ya', 'awhile', 'pretty', 'lightweight', 'stuff', 'Prince', 'patented', 'pseudo-Christian', 'imagery', 'music', 'did', 'make', 'cut', 'quite', 'good', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'fanatics', 'will', 'balk', 'new', 'jack', 'sound', 'was', 'rage', '1990.In', 'short', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'Prince', 'new', 'fans', 'who', 'still', 'believe', 'Purple', 'Wonder', 'best', 'thing', 'there', 'Graffiti', 'Bridge', 'playful', 'little', 'curiosity', 'end', 'really', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad.Oh', 'nice', 'have', '4', 'music', 'videos', 'especially', 'rare', 'live', 'version', 'Question', 'U']",N/A
288885,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,6301982576,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[0, 1]","Now this is one of those films that get's put into the Golden Raspberry variety of 80's/90's B level films even though it's essentially a follow up toPurple Rain. Personally I feel some of that might have to do with Prince's persona at this point in general. Towards the end of the 80's Prince was continually seeking a very different musical vision,seeking artistic vision with a spiritual bent that resulted in a lot of critical acclaim but a dip in sales. And this movie arrived smack dab during that period. Obviously somewhat inspired by hisLovesexyera this movie showcased the same basic characters asPurple Rain; The Kid,The Time and even Jill Jones shows up again. On the other hand this movie's plot isn't as easy to follow and takes a few watchings to fully understand it's points. Basically The Kid and The Time now have two seperate and competing clubs alongside to others-George's (run in the film by George Clinton) and Melody Cool,owned by a like named character played by Mavis Staples. The Time and The Kid are both quite different characters in this film. The Time are portrayed now as more confrontational adversaries to The Kid in trying to close his club Glam Slam because,again his music isn't making any money. The Kids' arrogent cockiness in the first film is replaced by a more reflective,brooding character whose ego manifests itself more like a man on a quest than someone trying to prove themselves. Again musical performances on both ends are the order of the day. The Time get a lot more songs here and,not only that the leading lady element is quite different. A mysteious lady calling herself Aura (Ingrid Chavez) appears out of nowhere,playing The Kid and Morris off eachother in an effort to turn Morris towards giving The Kid more of a chance and seems to appear when The Kid is in danger of losing his fight. Unlike his previous leading lady The Kid treats Aura with a lot of respect and maturity while Morris would....of course rather look at his own face in his silver compact. It's a more metaphorical good versus evil story in which the definitions of both aren't 100% clear (are they ever) and the musical performances play out the narrative. In the end Aura either accidently or purposely sacrifices herself and it's The Kid's obvious emotional agony as he sings ""Still Would Stand All Time"" as if it were THE gospel sways Morris to relent and let The Kid do his thing. The musical performances,much as Prince's subsequent Nude tour features a lot of dancers and bright primary colors that seperate this from the Prince of 1984 along with performances from Mavis,George and Tevin Campbell. So Prince and The Time aren't the only musical focus of this film either. It showcases a different movie from a different kind of Prince and even if many like it where others don't it's an entirely different outlook than Prince's 80's experience.",5,Prince Pumping The Big Noise In The Night,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,2878,"['Now', 'one', 'films', 'get', 'put', 'Golden', 'Raspberry', 'variety', ""80's/90"", 'B', 'level', 'films', 'even', 'essentially', 'follow', 'up', 'toPurple', 'Rain', 'Personally', 'feel', 'might', 'have', 'do', 'Prince', 'persona', 'point', 'general', 'end', '80', 'Prince', 'was', 'continually', 'seeking', 'very', 'different', 'musical', 'vision', 'seeking', 'artistic', 'vision', 'spiritual', 'bent', 'resulted', 'lot', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'dip', 'sales', 'movie', 'arrived', 'smack', 'dab', 'period', 'Obviously', 'somewhat', 'inspired', 'hisLovesexyera', 'movie', 'showcased', 'same', 'basic', 'characters', 'asPurple', 'Rain', 'Kid', 'Time', 'even', 'Jill', 'Jones', 'up', 'again', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'plot', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'follow', 'few', 'watchings', 'fully', 'understand', 'points', 'Basically', 'Kid', 'Time', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'seperate', 'competing', 'clubs', 'alongside', 'others-George', 'run', 'film', 'George', 'Clinton', 'Melody', 'Cool', 'owned', 'like', 'named', 'character', 'played', 'Mavis', 'Staples', 'Time', 'Kid', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'characters', 'film', 'Time', 'are', 'portrayed', 'now', 'more', 'confrontational', 'adversaries', 'Kid', 'trying', 'close', 'club', 'Glam', 'Slam', 'again', 'music', ""n't"", 'making', 'money', 'Kids', 'arrogent', 'cockiness', 'first', 'film', 'replaced', 'more', 'reflective', 'brooding', 'character', 'ego', 'more', 'man', 'quest', 'someone', 'trying', 'prove', 'Again', 'musical', 'performances', 'ends', 'are', 'order', 'day', 'Time', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'songs', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'leading', 'lady', 'element', 'quite', 'different', 'mysteious', 'lady', 'calling', 'Aura', 'Ingrid', 'Chavez', 'nowhere', 'playing', 'Kid', 'Morris', 'off', 'eachother', 'effort', 'turn', 'Morris', 'towards', 'giving', 'Kid', 'more', 'chance', 'appear', 'when', 'Kid', 'danger', 'losing', 'fight', 'previous', 'leading', 'lady', 'Kid', 'Aura', 'lot', 'respect', 'maturity', 'Morris', 'would', '.of', 'course', 'rather', 'look', 'own', 'face', 'silver', 'compact', 'more', 'metaphorical', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'story', 'definitions', 'are', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'clear', 'are', 'ever', 'musical', 'performances', 'play', 'out', 'narrative', 'end', 'Aura', 'accidently', 'purposely', 'sacrifices', 'Kid', 'obvious', 'emotional', 'agony', 'Still', 'Would', 'Stand', 'All', 'Time', 'were', 'THE', 'gospel', 'sways', 'Morris', 'relent', 'let', 'Kid', 'do', 'thing', 'musical', 'performances', 'much', 'Prince', 'subsequent', 'Nude', 'tour', 'lot', 'dancers', 'bright', 'primary', 'colors', 'seperate', 'Prince', '1984', 'performances', 'Mavis', 'George', 'Tevin', 'Campbell', 'So', 'Prince', 'Time', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'musical', 'focus', 'film', 'either', 'different', 'movie', 'different', 'kind', 'Prince', 'even', 'many', 'where', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'different', 'outlook', 'Prince', '80', 'experience']",N/A

Unfortunately, it cannot be found in this weak script that is loosely taped together with numerous music videos.Prince reprises his Purple Rain character, The Kid, who is now a performer and co-owner of a club, the Glam Slam, with his former rival (Morris Day). Business turns sour when The Kid is ""asked"" by his partner to pay shakedown money to the mayor. So, in a quest for truth, justice and full ownership of the club, The Kid challenges his business partner to a music battle.The plans for the movie started in 1987, but delays - primarily due to casting problems - kept delaying its production.

Then Prince thought he would make a movie centered on THE TIME, but Warner Brothers demanded that it be a sequel to PURPLE RAIN.

It's about the Kid and Morris squaring off against each other on how a club they share ownership should be run.  A mysterious woman enters both their lives (Aura - Ingrid Chavez), and she becomes the catalyst for them to both change in spiritual ways.The DVD is fine - almost a direct port of the laserdisc print.

Then along comes a woman named, you guessed it, Aura.

It all comez out in tha wash...........",5,Funky Town,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,920,"['immortal', 'words', 'Starfish', 'Coffee', 'u', 'set', 'ur', 'mind', 'free', 'baby', 'maybe', 'u', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'best', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'Graffiti', 'Bridge', 'U', 'have', '2', 'open', 'ur', 'mind', 'take', 'journey', 'Prince', 'Have', 'couple', 'glasses', 'red', 'wine', 'share', 'ur', 'bed', 'watch', 'Graffiti', 'Bridge', 'immerge', 'mystical', 'world', 'Prince', 'enjoyed', 'trip', 'let', 'Prince', 'take', 'control', 'really', 'get', 'n2', 'tha', 'movie', 'loved', 'hearing', 'watching', 'Elephant', 'Flowers', 'Tha', 'U', 'Prince', 'best', 'works', 'incorporated', 'film', 'message', 'Graffiti', 'Bridge', 'simple', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'GIVE', 'UP', 'HOPE', 'loved', 'being', 'Prince', 'mystical', 'Graffiti', 'Bridge', 'world', 'better', 'reality', 'know', 'wish', 'could', 'live', 'Prince', 'world', 'are', 'rulez', 'Paisley', 'Park', 'Graffiti', 'Bridge', 'wonderful', 'lil', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'willing', 'participant', 'tha', 'journey', 'out', 'tha', 'wash', '..']",N/A
