So a family friend suggests hiring a private detective. The suggestion is to hire Nick Trayne (James Dunn) a friend that gave up that profession. Nick comes on the scene to fins Craig has been returned, in body that is as now he is a zombie. Unable to control himself it looks as if some evil doer is guiding him to murder. Meantime Nick is falling for Craig's secretary Billie Hilton (Joan Woodbury) so the best way to protect her from being a victim is to unravel the plot; that is before he also gets dispatched.This is a light hearted mystery that has all the elements that make for a good story. It looks like everyone could have done it and yet no one. Is it always the last person you suspect? And even a romantic interest between the detective and one of the cute suspects.

1461009,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005HIBWC0,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 4]","From 1931 through 1953, Monogram Pictures Corporation was known to create films in Hollywood on low budgets.  But from their films, there were a few that became big stars.  Two of those stars went on to bigger projects, James Howard Dunn (""Bad Girl, ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"", ""Society Girl"", ""Hello, Sister!"") and Joan Woodbury (""Chan on Broadway"", ""Brenda Starr, Reporter"", ""The Ten Commandments"").Both talents starred in the 1942 film ""The Living Ghost"".  Directed by William Beaudine based on the original story by Howard Dimsdale and a screenplay adaptation by Joseph Hoffman.And the film ""The Living Ghost"" has been selected for release under Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's ""Limited Edition Collection"" which is the company's MOD (Made-on-Demand) series, similar to Warner Bros. has done with Warner Archive and Sony's Columbia Classics.The films usually do not have special features, nor have they been remastered, fixed-up or gone through any expensive restoration work.  If anything, a lot of these films are targeted to a nice group of movie fans and collectors and are typically not the big giant titles that movie studios would want to promote.And because Monogram Pictures films were low-budget films and the fact that interest in classic Hollywood is waning, fortunately, there is a niche group of movie fans, such as myself who value these films, high-budget or low-budget, just the opportunity to watch them brings happiness to us.But with that being said, because these films are not sold for cheap and are sold typically under $20 with no special features and nothing but the film, this group expects a good print with no major problems with the disc.So, before I go on with my review for ""The Living Ghost"", the question many will want to know first is... ""Does it play without problems?"".  I played this DVD on my Sony PS3 and on my Mac with no problems whatsoever.  No stalling, no shadowing, no errors.  It played perfectly.The hour-long film begins with millionaire Walter Craig (played by Gus Glassmire) having disappeared from his home.  The worried family has contacted authorities but one of the family friends, Ed Moline (played by Paul McVey) knew a former detective who was very good at his job.  That detective's name is Nick Trayne (played by James Dunn).Nick quit the police force because he was growing tired of dealing with murderers and thieves but Ed believes he's the best man to help the family.Unfortunately, it's going to take some cajoling as Nick now has a business ""listening"" to people's problems and charging money to them for listening.  Ed and Walter Craig's secretary Billie Hilton (played by Joan Woodbury) try their best to convince Nick by telling him that the family will pay him $25,000 if he solves the case.  But Nick isn't interested.But to get him to do it, Ed told Billie that there is one weakness that Nick has and that is anyone telling him that he has done a bad job as an investigator.  So, Billie uses degradation tactics of Trayne's character to anger him and eventually Nick decides to take the case.And of course, everyone in the Craig family is assumed as guilty at first and Nick has a suspicion towards each of them, because they are all acting unusual.After staying with the family and questioning each of them, as all of them are asleep, a family member begins screaming.  As the family and Nick rush to see what happened, they are all shocked to see Walter Craig sitting on the couch.  Non-responsive but alive.The Dr. tells Nicke that Walter Craig  is alive, he can eat, he can walk...but part of his brain has been destroyed somehow.So, Nick with the help of Billie Hilton try to look for clues and solve the case.But one night, as Nick tries to investigate the action at night outside the garden, he sees a dead George Phillips (played by J. Arthur Young), a family friend, on the ground and standing over him is Walter Craig.  But Walter doesn't have the mental capacity to kill anyone?  Or does he?Nick and Billie race against time as they try to solve the case before someone else is killed.MOD PLAYABILITY:Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's are the printing quality of the discs. There are some who can't get them to play on various DVD players or on their computers and unfortunately, they literally become table-top coasters.With ""The Living Ghost"", I can tell you that these discs are printed quite well with actual printing on top of the DVD (it's not a plain silver disc with letters). If you didn't know the disc was an MOD DVD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.As for playability, I played it on my Sony PlayStation 3 with no problems. I then played it on my Mac, no problems whatsoever.VIDEO AND AUDIO:As far as picture quality goes, the film has been manufactured using the best source available.  But its important to remember that Monogram Pictures Corporation films were created with a low budget and these films have not gone through any major restoration.  With that being said, you can see the dust and scratches on the film, as well as mild flickering but other than that, the film is watchable and I personally had no problems watching this film, considering some Monogram Pictures films that I have seen were also not in the greatest shape, but compared to those films, ""The Living Ghost"" is watchable, no blurring, no ghosting.  Just scratches and dust primarily.As for audio, the film is presented in Dolby Digital. Dialogue is clear as well as the sounds of thunder cracking and wind.  I actually chose to listen to this film with stereo on all channels activated on my receiver and for the most part, the film sounds very good and didn't hear any major hiss or crackle while watching.SPECIAL FEATURES:MOD's or Video on Demand DVD's most often don't carry special features.JUDGMENT CALL:There is something about Monogram Pictures that I love.  These films were literally, low-budget films that were made to fill theaters up with movie content during a time there was no television.The films were an hour long or sometimes longer but they were primarily popcorn action or popcorn comedy films.  ""The Living Ghost"" is a mix of comedy and suspense.  James Dunn does a great job playing the detective Nick Trayne, and while he is busy solving cases, he's also busy trying to win the affections of Billie Hilton.And while the film does have the banality of the ""who done it?"" mystery films, what makes ""The Living Ghost"" quite fun is the pairing of James Dunn and Joan Woodbury.  For me, their relationship reminds me of an early version of ""opposites attract"" individuals who are trying to solve a case, similar to today's ""Castle"" or ""Moonlighting"" from the '80s.  Two people who have chemistry, who love flirting with each other, getting angry towards each other but they work quite well with each other.So, for the most part, ""The Living Ghost"" is a fun Monogram Pictures film from the early '40s and it looks quite well for a film nearly 70-years-old.As for the DVD, while the picture quality is much better compared to a Monogram Pictures film ""Campus Rhythm"" (released on the same day as ""The Living Ghost"" via MGM's Limited Edition Collection), there is one scene where a few frames are missing as the music suddenly stops abruptly during the investigation but it's nothing major. Nothing that would ruin one's viewing of the film.I also noticed that the beginning does not start out with the Monogram Pictures logo but starts out with the British company Anglo-Amalgamate (which is a UK company that specializes in low-budget films).  So, I wonder if the original U.S. film elements were destroyed?  But still, if this is all that is left in terms of film elements for ""The Living Ghost"", I'm not going to complain as this movie looks good for its age and I was definitely entertained.With the release of ""The Living Ghost"" and ""Campus Rhythm"" on DVD via MGM's MOD (Made on Demand) ""Limited Edition Collection"", I can only hope for more Monogram Pictures releases because they may not have the top box office stars of the 1940's but still, the movies are entertaining and fun to watch!Another MOD film on DVD worth recommending!",3,"A fun detective film with humor and suspense

The authors do take offence at snide remarks from other critics, but even they don't have much good to say about it. When rich banker Walter Craig disappears from his home, his useless family (and assorted hangers-on) settle on hiring ex-DA investigator Nick Trayne to look into the case. Trayne has given up (he says) chasing bank robbers and murderers and has become a ""sympathetic listener"". Here's where you'll start grinding your teeth. Nick's new office is filled with jabbering idiots (one with an invisible....dog?), and Nick seems to have gone native, wearing a 40's ""swami"" outfit and a bath towel (from the ""Turkish bath"", he admits) on his head. James Dunn, the actor playing Nick, is 41 years old here. He looks 55+, and acts 13 going on 6. Joan Woodbury, playing Craig's secretary (and who conveniently lives in the Craig household) is 27 and is the brunt of Dunn's infuriating wisecracks. After the first 20 minutes, I was sorely wishing she'd haul off and give him a solid smack, but this being the usual Hollywood, they end up getting married. (But not until after he fulfills a threat he made in the earliest part of the flick.)Now, I can handle most hokum, but this has cornier gags than anything I've seen outside of Wheeler & Woolsey. Folks, that's grim viewing indeed and would have been totally passe by the time this was released. The sets are obviously the same ones used in the many Sidney Toler Charlie Chan flicks Monogram was cranking out, and the plot holes are plentiful.
