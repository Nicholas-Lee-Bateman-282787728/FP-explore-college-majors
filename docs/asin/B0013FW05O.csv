Well, this film is not nearly of the same caliber.  The pacing is poor, story somewhat clumsily rendered, and all the action takes place right near the end!

The guy who plays Wallace's father looks remarkably like him. Part of the ironic genius of this show is the extremely stunning scenery in which all the violence of the story takes place.  If you've started with City of God, continued with the TV series ""City of Men"" then you'll surely be catching this last part of the trilogy also called City of Men (the movie, not the series).

1142000,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0013FW05O,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""City of Men"" is a feature film version of a blockbuster series that ran on Brazilian TV from 2002 to 2005. It is also a sequel of sorts to the earlier ""City of God,"" an award-winning movie directed by Fernando Meirelles.Paul Morelli's ""City of Men"" focuses on Laranjinha (Darlan Cunha) and Acerola (Douglas Silva), two honorable teens who are struggling to make a decent life for themselves in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.  The former is searching for the father he's never known, while the latter is only beginning to learn what it means to be a father to his own son.  Their personal story is set against the backdrop of a violent turf-war between two rival gangs that are battling it out for preeminence in the city.""City of Men"" reveals its origins as a TV series in the novelistic approach it takes to storytelling and character development.  From the beginning, we feel as if we have been thrust into the midst of a story ""already in progress.""  With little explanatory background, the screenplay (by Elena Soarez) introduces us all at once to a multiplicity of characters, whose relationships with one another we are forced to pick up almost on the fly as it were.  This allows us to become both an observer of and an active participant in the drama that unfolds.Certainly, one of the most important characters in the movie is the city itself, since it is this very environment of poverty, hopelessness and violence that, in large measure, determines the kinds of lives these people will lead and the types of futures they will have.Morelli's directorial style is up-close-and-personal in the more intimate moments, and vivid and exciting in the pulse-pounding ""action"" sequences.  The sense of immediacy that he and cinematographer Adriano Goldman bring to the work acts as an effective counterweight to some of the more melodramatic elements that creep into the screenplay towards the end.With excellent performances and a surprising amount of optimism given its generally depressing milieu and setting, ""City of Men"" is a tale of friendship and adult responsibility that will move the spirit and touch the heart.",4,a smashing drama,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,2123,"['City', 'Men', 'feature', 'film', 'version', 'blockbuster', 'series', 'ran', 'Brazilian', 'TV', '2002', '2005', 'also', 'sequel', 'sorts', 'earlier', 'City', 'God', 'award-winning', 'movie', 'directed', 'Fernando', 'Meirelles.Paul', 'Morelli', 'City', 'Men', 'Laranjinha', 'Darlan', 'Cunha', 'Acerola', 'Douglas', 'Silva', 'two', 'honorable', 'teens', 'who', 'are', 'struggling', 'make', 'decent', 'life', 'slums', 'Rio', 'Janeiro', 'former', 'searching', 'father', 'never', 'known', 'latter', 'only', 'beginning', 'learn', 'what', 'be', 'father', 'own', 'son', 'personal', 'story', 'set', 'backdrop', 'violent', 'turf-war', 'two', 'rival', 'gangs', 'are', 'battling', 'out', 'preeminence', 'city', 'City', 'Men', 'origins', 'TV', 'series', 'novelistic', 'approach', 'storytelling', 'character', 'development', 'beginning', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'thrust', 'midst', 'story', 'already', 'progress', 'little', 'explanatory', 'background', 'screenplay', 'Elena', 'Soarez', 'once', 'multiplicity', 'characters', 'relationships', 'one', 'are', 'forced', 'pick', 'up', 'almost', 'fly', 'were', 'become', 'observer', 'active', 'participant', 'drama', 'unfolds.Certainly', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'characters', 'movie', 'city', 'very', 'environment', 'poverty', 'hopelessness', 'violence', 'large', 'measure', 'kinds', 'lives', 'people', 'will', 'lead', 'types', 'futures', 'will', 'have.Morelli', 'directorial', 'style', 'up-close-and-personal', 'more', 'intimate', 'moments', 'vivid', 'exciting', 'pulse-pounding', 'action', 'sequences', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'cinematographer', 'Adriano', 'Goldman', 'bring', 'work', 'effective', 'counterweight', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'elements', 'creep', 'screenplay', 'end.With', 'excellent', 'performances', 'surprising', 'amount', 'optimism', 'given', 'generally', 'depressing', 'milieu', 'setting', 'City', 'Men', 'tale', 'friendship', 'adult', 'responsibility', 'will', 'move', 'spirit', 'touch', 'heart']",City of Men
1142001,A55Z5EKU7AI7O,B0013FW05O,yngking01,"[0, 1]",When I first found out this was being made I almost pissed my pants lol.  As I said in a previous review I did City of God (this movie's spiritual prequel) is one of my favorite movies of all time.  So when I found out it would be getting a successor I was beyond ecstatic.  This movie however is not City of God quality by any means.  Don't get me wrong it's a good movie but not what I was truly expecting.  I guess if I had did some research those expectations could have been spared some.  This movie is actually the conclusion of a tv show (u know how HBO did Sex in The City) the show has excellent reviews but I couldn't really get into it because it focuses on the lives of two friends and is kinda gritty but not gritty as City of God or most crime dramas are.  Mainly because they are different genres City of God is like Scarface or Goodfellas as were City of Men is like Wonder Years set in a Brazilian Favela (think the hoodest ghetto you can think of and square it).  City of Men does aim to gain more of that City of God grit towards the latter part of the film but I think that may have just been thrown in to appease people (studios) who were fans of City of God.,4,Not City of God,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,1180,"['When', 'first', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'almost', 'pissed', 'pants', 'lol', 'said', 'previous', 'review', 'did', 'City', 'God', 'movie', 'spiritual', 'prequel', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'So', 'when', 'found', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'successor', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'movie', 'however', 'not', 'City', 'God', 'quality', 'means', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'truly', 'expecting', 'guess', 'had', 'did', 'research', 'expectations', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'movie', 'actually', 'conclusion', 'tv', 'show', 'u', 'know', 'how', 'HBO', 'did', 'Sex', 'City', 'show', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'lives', 'two', 'friends', 'kinda', 'gritty', 'not', 'gritty', 'City', 'God', 'most', 'crime', 'dramas', 'are', 'Mainly', 'are', 'different', 'genres', 'City', 'God', 'like', 'Scarface', 'Goodfellas', 'were', 'City', 'Men', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'set', 'Brazilian', 'Favela', 'think', 'hoodest', 'ghetto', 'can', 'think', 'square', 'City', 'Men', 'aim', 'gain', 'more', 'City', 'God', 'grit', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'thrown', 'appease', 'people', 'studios', 'who', 'were', 'fans', 'City', 'God']",City of Men
