One of the other reviewers referred to the end scene as a ""disappointment""-I would not call it a disappointment, but it was sad to think of the possibility of Pooh and Piglets fate as such. There is a time in everyone's life where they have to learn how life goes round-most likely that reviewers little one did not even understand what was happening in the end scene-at that age(2ish) it is all about the ""HOO-HAH"" and the silly things that the characters do in the movie that keep them glued to the tube-not about the shock of a possibility of Pooh and Piglet dieing-kids at that age just don't understand that concept yet.",5,A honey of a movie,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,753,"['Anyone', 'who', 'not', 'like', 'Pooh', 'gang', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'Scrooge', 'story', 'Piglet', 'mostly', 'adorable', 'One', 'other', 'reviewers', 'referred', 'end', 'scene', 'disappointment', '-I', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'disappointment', 'was', 'sad', 'think', 'possibility', 'Pooh', 'Piglets', 'fate', 'such', 'time', 'everyone', 'life', 'where', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'life', 'round-most', 'likely', 'little', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'end', 'scene-at', 'age', '2ish', 'HOO-HAH', 'silly', 'things', 'characters', 'do', 'movie', 'keep', 'glued', 'tube-not', 'shock', 'possibility', 'Pooh', 'Piglet', 'dieing-kids', 'age', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'concept', 'yet']",N/A
753992,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00009L4S2,A Customer,"[0, 1]","Summary:The movie begins with Piglet (John Fiedler (I)) drawing in his memory book as the rest of the gang walks past on an adventure.  Piglet sees them and follows only to find out that he is too 'small' (this is the point of the emphasis on 'BIG' in the title) to be of any help in Pooh's (Jim Cummings) plan to get more honey with the help of Tigger (also Jim Cummings), Eeyore (Peter Cullen), and Rabbit (Ken Sansom).  Suddenly the plan goes haywire and Piglet is the one to save the day but no one notices.Feeling left out, Piglet leaves the successful adventurers feeling under appreciated only to be able to help several small animals in the hundred-acre wood.  Realizing he can be of help, he heads back to the adventurers but doesn't find them so he embarks on a journey to look for them.When the honey adventurers' success turns into a disaster they end up fleeing back to Piglet's house for safety.  When they realize he isn't there they decide to go find him.  Striking upon a rather 'brilliant' means of tracking Piglet, they decide to use his memory book to locate him (&quot;It's a memory book, it will remember where he is&quot;).  As they go along they encounter the rest of the characters as they recount the different adventures they have had and Piglet's vital role in all of them.Eventually they find Piglet, or rather he finds them, and it is in the nick of time as they desperately need someone to help them save Pooh.  Piglet does and they are all happy to tell him how much they care about him, turning the movie into a tribute to Piglet.My Comments:The meaning of friendship isn't very deeply hidden beneath any surfaces in this movie.  As a matter of fact it's downright obvious.  Which is probably a good idea seeing as how this movie is aimed at kids.  I guess with that audience the obvious approach works better than the subtle one.I was kind of roped into watching this DVD in order to write a review for it and the reason I'm telling you that is because I normally wouldn't have picked this movie to watch on my own.  I recognize that it is a kids movie and, frankly, as a kids movie it isn't very entertaining for adults.  The one exception to that is if you have read 'The Tao of Pooh', which I highly recommend if you haven't read it.  If you've read that book then keep the character analyses in mind when you watch Winnie the Pooh movies; you'll find they are much funnier and more entertaining because you can't get pictures of Pooh as an enlightened buddha out of your mind.  Anyway, on to the review...As movies go, this is really more like the occasional television episode that is pretty much just a series of flashbacks to older episodes.  The majority of the movie is made up of the reminiscences of the group as they remember how good of a friend Piglet has been to them.  Not having kept up with the Winnie the Pooh movies or shows I'm not sure if the flashbacks were previously produced.  If they were, then this has to be the most brilliant money making scheme that Disney has come up with yet - create about 20 minutes of new animation to incorporate old animation and sell it as a new feature length film.  Seems pretty brilliant to me.  If the flashbacks haven't been previously produced then it is probably worth your time to watch the movie and/or buy it if you're a big fan (or enjoy Eastern philosophy gags).The characters are all the same, nothing new here; nothing exciting.  The story is, as mentioned above, pretty simple, even for Winnie the Pooh.  There are a few witty elements, like the North Pole being a stick (get it, North pole?) and the memory book thing.  And for any 'Tao of Pooh' fans, Pooh's lines throughout carry the same connotations as are described in the book (of course I could be reading in to them, but I never know with the Tao, no one does).  There really isn't much to criticize about the movie because it is so simple.  I guess there are a couple of plot problems I can point out.  They never really explain where Piglet was while everyone was looking for him.  Also, they employ Roo getting a cold as an excuse to go back to Pooh's place in order to recreate Piglet's memory book, but suddenly Roo's cold is gone when they decide it's time to go back to find Piglet.  And when they do go back out to find Piglet there is a very brief storm, but then suddenly it's gone after the one scene when they are seen leaving Pooh's house; after that it seems like it's nice skies.  So, I guess there are some story problems, but they aren't really things that young kids would notice, so it isn't really a big deal, unless you're into pointing out plot problems.Overall, the movie is very short (it says 75 minutes but it's more like 65), and not particularly engaging.  I guess it does have a good message about the importance of friends and telling friends how much you care about them, but unless you are a Winnie the Pooh fan, a young person who likes Pooh, or enjoy 'The Tao of Pooh', you can probably skip this one and not feel bad about it.  I only recommend it for the groups mentioned.",3,It's just what the title says - all about Piglet,1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,5072,"['Summary', 'movie', 'Piglet', 'John', 'Fiedler', 'drawing',

I enjoyed sitting back and watching this loving movie with my son.The story was very nice.  The animals of the 100 acre woods are out looking for Piglet using his book of memories to lead them from place to place hoping the books remembers where Piglet is.  While going through they remember old stories from Piglet's memory and makes them all realize how underappreciated Piglet is.  As they re-examine those memories they see how pig of a part little Piglet had and they come to have a new-found love for him.  It was very cute and heart warming and should remind us all to look for the little guys in our lives who make a big impact on our lives.Very lovable.  Even I enjoyed it!!

That doesn't stop Disney from telling a pretty big tale for tikes that includes Piglet saving the day on a couple of more than memorable occasions. This episodic feature film looks like it might have been produced originally for the direct-to-video market and then sidetracked to the theaters. Piglet's Big Movie is charming with fluid animation. Although it doesn't quite capture the qualities of the feature film (that was divded up into the two original Pooh shorts), it has a energy missing from those films and more akin to the television series.Big Movie is predictable but that's precisely what little ones really want. There are some nice extras tacked on to the DVD. While Big Movie doesn't measure up to the best in the Pooh series, it has a number of charming and memorable moments that little ones will enjoy. No one dies, is murdered, chases someone else in a car, is abused or put in jail. That along with the Carly Simon contribution makes Piglet's Big Movie a nice, quiet family film that little ones can enjoy and parents don't have to fret about.
