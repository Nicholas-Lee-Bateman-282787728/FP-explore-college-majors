1166090,A1V8OYLDDQERDH,B001AIQ154,Bakuryuu Tyranno,"[3, 3]","Good news - the movies are very suspenseful, usually relying on unsettling settings and atmosphere, and on characters the audience can invest in.Bad news - While considerably better than Hollywood's current formulas, it would appear that Spanish films also have formulas and therefore, watching several close together becomes repetitive.Thankfully that saves me the trouble of reviewing each individual movie, so I'll skip forward to the ones I found memorable.""The Baby's Room"" essentially is about an old house, in which the occupants, having recently moved there, start hearing mysterious voices and later, images of a mysterious man watching their baby. Is the house haunted? Actually it becomes very weird.""To Let"" features a couple in search of an apartment. However, the place they're checking out might not be quite as harmless as it seems, as the owner clearly has issues. This film has much faster pacing than the other films in the collection.The above two were very good with setting atmosphere!Aside from lacking variation in general - even with their varied themes many similarities are present in these films - there isn't any significant downside to the collection. I'd suggest spacing out watching these because, despite providing what's lacking from most big-budget horror films, watching these shortly after each other will feel repetitive.I give them a collective score of 20/30, which should be 3.3 stars which should round down becoming three stars, however with four decent films and three good ones, the collection feels better than the combined sum of its parts.",4,I'll be generous and rate four stars,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1587,"['Good', 'news', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'usually', 'relying', 'unsettling', 'settings', 'atmosphere', 'characters', 'audience', 'can', 'invest', 'in.Bad', 'news', 'considerably', 'better', 'Hollywood', 'current', 'formulas', 'would', 'appear', 'Spanish', 'films', 'also', 'have', 'formulas', 'therefore', 'watching', 'several', 'close', 'together', 'repetitive.Thankfully', 'trouble', 'reviewing', 'individual', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'forward', 'ones', 'found', 'memorable', 'Baby', 'Room', 'essentially', 'old', 'house', 'occupants', 'having', 'recently', 'moved', 'there', 'start', 'hearing', 'mysterious', 'voices', 'later', 'images', 'mysterious', 'man', 'watching', 'baby', 'house', 'haunted', 'Actually', 'very', 'weird', 'Let', 'couple', 'search', 'apartment', 'However', 'place', ""'re"", 'checking', 'out', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'as', 'harmless', 'owner', 'clearly', 'issues', 'film', 'much', 'faster', 'pacing', 'other', 'films', 'collection.The', 'two', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'setting', 'atmosphere', 'Aside', 'lacking', 'variation', 'general', 'even', 'varied', 'themes', 'many', 'similarities', 'are', 'present', 'films', ""n't"", 'significant', 'downside', 'collection', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'spacing', 'out', 'watching', 'providing', 'what', 'lacking', 'most', 'big-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'watching', 'shortly', 'other', 'will', 'feel', 'repetitive.I', 'give', 'collective', 'score', '20/30', 'should', 'be', '3.3', 'stars', 'should', 'round', 'down', 'becoming', 'three', 'stars', 'however', 'four', 'decent', 'films', 'three', 'good', 'ones', 'collection', 'better', 'combined', 'sum', 'parts']",6 Films To Keep You Awake

1166092,A2TWPL984OQ5DN,B001AIQ154,Doctor Dean,"[0, 2]","I am a huge fan of horror films, and constantly search for any that I have not seen. Apparently, fourteen Spanish-speaking fans have seen these, and I bought it based on their four- and five-star ratings. I believe that these films should be required by law to offer English language options is sold in the US. The cover is in English, the previews are in English, and Lions Gate is in English: I think it is at least a little deceiving to not offer English language for the main features. I have low vision, making it difficult or impossible to read and keep up with the English subtitles. Now, before you sensitive Spanish-language fans suggest that I should learn Spanish, as you have before, keep in mind that I have seen horror films from Japan, Korea, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. I don't have the time or desire to learn six different languages just to watch movies. If I began learning them all, I'd never get to see another movie. I have been caught in this dilema before, and try to be cautios now. However, as you see here, this ad promoses that this feature is &#34;Language: English.&#34; Finally, when I have on previous occasions gotten my chair moved close enough to see some of the captioning, I have always found even the best of these foreign-language films, when it comes to story and plot and acting, to be a bit odd in taste when compared to those produced in the US. They are often interesting to me, but not usually very frightening. All-in-all, if you're English speaking only, save your money on this one and buy the book instead: you're going to have to read it anyway.",1,Warning! Warning! SPANISH LANGUAGE ONLY!!!!! Warning!

1166093,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B001AIQ154,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","There are a million horror flicks out there and most of them are pretty awful. The challenge for any writer/director is to find those things that will creep people out but hasn't been done to death. ""The Baby's Room"" might not be totally original but it's done up pretty well and sends the creep dial up to 8.Here's the scoop. A couple, with a newborn, buys a beautiful but old house. They plan to restore it but almost immediately things start to feel wrong. An audio baby monitor reveals a presence in their son's room. An upgrade video monitor shows the intruder. Locks are replaced, alarm systems installed but the intruder is still present. Nerves are frayed, hubby's work begins to suffer. He starts to uncover an uncomfortable history in the house and plans to set things right. But of course things are never that easy.I be likin' this director Alex de la Iglesia. He handles his work well. I usually find jump scares to be cheap, but he has one here that is too cool not to like. He also throws some physics in in the form of quantum theory (Schroedinger's Cat) to explain the parallel worlds. This is shot and cut well so the watch is real smooth. And at a svelt 77 minutes, it won't tax your attention span. The ""Twilight Zone"" type ending might annoy a few, and, as the problem existed in the house long before these folks got there, there is nothing to really explain how hubby ended up in both worlds. But this is still a heck of a watch.If you like a more thoughtful type horror flick, this should do you.",4,The Baby's Room,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,1520,"['are', 'million', 'horror', 'flicks', 'there', 'most', 'are', 'pretty', 'awful', 'challenge', 'writer/director', 'find', 'things', 'will', 'creep', 'people', 'out', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'death', 'Baby', 'Room', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'totally', 'original', 'done', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'creep', 'dial', 'up', '8.Here', 'scoop', 'couple', 'newborn', 'beautiful', 'old', 'house', 'plan', 'restore', 'almost', 'immediately', 'things', 'start', 'feel', 'wrong', 'audio', 'baby', 'monitor', 'presence', 'son', 'room', 'upgrade', 'video', 'monitor', 'intruder', 'Locks', 'are', 'replaced', 'alarm', 'systems', 'installed', 'intruder', 'still', 'present', 'Nerves', 'are', 'frayed', 'hubby', 'work', 'suffer', 'uncover', 'uncomfortable', 'history', 'house', 'plans', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'course', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'easy.I', 'be', 'likin', 'director', 'Alex', 'de', 'la', 'Iglesia', 'work', 'well', 'usually', 'find', 'jump', 'scares', 'be', 'cheap', 'one', 'here', 'too', 'cool', 'not', 'like', 'also', 'physics', 'form', 'quantum', 'theory', 'Schroedinger', 'Cat', 'explain', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'shot', 'cut', 'well', 'so', 'watch', 'real', 'smooth', 'svelt', '77', 'minutes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tax', 'attention', 'span', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'type', 'ending', 'might', 'annoy', 'few', 'problem', 'existed', 'house', 'long', 'folks', 'got', 'there', 'nothing', 'really', 'explain', 'how', 'hubby', 'ended', 'up', 'worlds', 'still', 'heck', 'watch.If', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'type', 'horror', 'flick', 'should', 'do']",6 Films To Keep You Awake

We get some decent frights here and there but nothing really out there. I probably only truly enjoyed two chapters, A Christmas Tale and the Spectre.
