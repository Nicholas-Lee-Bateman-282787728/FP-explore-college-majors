1298764,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B002XUBDVA,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","There is a fine line between a good film, and one that is simply exploitative.  It's hard to say where that line is, but as they say, ""You will know it when you see it.""To be fair, I haven't truly ""seen"" this film, at least in its entirety.  I just can't make it through, and I've tried, at least three times.  Each time I try to watch, I just end up turning it off as I just can't stomach any of it.  This time, I made it quite a ways into the second act -- further then I've ever made it before -- but I still just had to turn it off.And I am a true-crime fan (not of the crimes themselves, of course, but of the genre), and I do know that movies about real-life serial killers can have value.  For example, I watched ""Blue Caprice"" a few months ago, and I would say that it was not only one of the best serial killer films ever, it also is a very fine film overall, regardless of genre.  ""Gray Man"" is also really good; it is a film about one of the nastiest serial killers ever, Albert Fish.  The writing, direction, and acting are all terrific in both of those films, so they both help prove that serial killer films can have real value.I will say that casting Scott Anthony Leet here was spot on, as he looks a lot like William Bonin, and Mr. Leet is a fairly strong actor.  I've never met or seen Mr. Bonin on any videos, but I would imagine that Mr. Leet channels the real-life serial killer well.  The acting will give you the creeps, at the very least.  And it's easy to imagine that this is what Mr. Bonin was really like.Supposedly, Mr. Bonin became friends with a ""gentleman"" named Vernon Butts (you really can't make up names such as these now, can you?) which reminds me a bit of the case of Dean Corll with his sidekicks David Brooks and Elmer Wayne Henley.  It is quite rare for serial killers to form a ""tag team;"" after all, to be a ""successful"" serial killer means that you must kill at least three people, and if you have more than one killer it really ups the chances of getting captured.  There have been other teams, such as Leonard Lake and Charles Ng, and the Toolbox Killers, but they remain the exception, not the rule.I guess the real question should be:  was it a wise idea even to make this film?  I would say probably not, as it would be difficult to take this story and not be exploitative.",2,Exploitative,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,2323,"['fine', 'line', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'simply', 'exploitative', 'hard', 'say', 'where', 'line', 'say', 'will', 'know', 'when', 'see', 'be', 'fair', 'have', ""n't"", 'truly', 'seen', 'film', 'least', 'entirety', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'time', 'try', 'watch', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'turning', 'off', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'time', 'made', 'quite', 'ways', 'second', 'act', 'further', 'then', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'made', 'still', 'just', 'had', 'turn', 'off.And', 'am', 'true-crime', 'fan', 'not', 'crimes', 'course', 'genre', 'do', 'know', 'movies', 'real-life', 'serial', 'killers', 'can', 'have', 'value', 'example', 'watched', 'Blue', 'Caprice', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'serial', 'killer', 'films', 'ever', 'also', 'very', 'fine', 'film', 'overall', 'regardless', 'genre', 'Gray', 'Man', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'nastiest', 'serial', 'killers', 'ever', 'Albert', 'Fish', 'writing', 'direction', 'acting', 'are', 'terrific', 'films', 'help', 'prove', 'serial', 'killer', 'films', 'can', 'have', 'real', 'value.I', 'will', 'say', 'casting', 'Scott', 'Anthony', 'Leet', 'here', 'was', 'spot', 'lot', 'William', 'Bonin', 'Mr.', 'Leet', 'fairly', 'strong', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Bonin', 'videos', 'would', 'imagine', 'Mr.', 'Leet', 'real-life', 'serial', 'killer', 'well', 'acting', 'will', 'give', 'creeps', 'very', 'least', 'easy', 'imagine', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Bonin', 'was', 'really', 'like.Supposedly', 'Mr.', 'Bonin', 'became', 'friends', 'gentleman', 'named', 'Vernon', 'Butts', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'names', 'such', 'now', 'can', 'bit', 'case', 'Dean', 'Corll', 'sidekicks', 'David', 'Brooks', 'Elmer', 'Wayne', 'Henley', 'quite', 'rare', 'serial', 'killers', 'form', 'tag', 'team', 'be', 'successful', 'serial', 'killer', 'must', 'kill', 'least', 'three', 'people', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'killer', 'really', 'chances', 'getting', 'captured', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'teams', 'such', 'Leonard', 'Lake', 'Charles', 'Ng', 'Toolbox', 'Killers', 'remain', 'exception', 'not', 'rule.I', 'guess', 'real', 'question', 'should', 'be', 'was', 'wise', 'idea', 'even', 'make', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'probably', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'take', 'story', 'not', 'be', 'exploitative']",N/A

So the two stars are given for the mesmerizing performance by Scott Leet who was truly creepy as the lead character Bill Bonin. His performance reminded me a great deal of some of the best serial killer performances in recent memory. His acting is excellent, and it's a wonderful thing that Leet's performance earns raves despite a pretty much terrible production quality and uneven story. That is a creadit to the work of a fine actor who was clearly way above the amature abilities of the director and production team. This is pretty much a terrible film, but this actor was simply brilliant in the role of the freeway killer. I must say that I was suprised that the violence was pretty much no more graphic than that of a pg-13 movie. It's not that brutal, not gory at all, and pretty tame, which leaves me scratching my head as to why some people felt this film was truly graphic and brutal. Well it's not at all. Truth be told, a few people get wacked on the head with a tire iron and strangled, and there's very little blood and the realism of it is simply not there. Again this movie stank to high heaven and was totally amature in it's production values, but if you want to see an excellent performance of a serial killer then Leet is your man.

1298767,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B002XUBDVA,Stuart Conover,"[2, 2]","Directed by John Murlowski who has a few horror movies under his belt and written by David Birke who clearly has a fetish for writing serial killer movies having previously done ones on Gazy and Dahmer among others. It's clear that this duo has had experience in the horror genre in the past it's no surprise that they were able to put together something that was extremely interesting - if not overly scary, gory, or suspenseful. Had this not been based on a true story or told ahead of time that the main character was in prison there may have been a high amount of suspense for us to run with for anyone not knowing the story ahead of time. Even without any real 'fright' factor it still easily fits in the realm of horror and was a very captivating watch.Freeway Killer tells the story of the serial killer William Bonin (Scott Leet) and the two apprentices that he trained: Vernon Butts (Dusty Sorg) and later on in the life Kyle (Cole Williams.) What absolutely works about this film is how Scott plays William. He is able to be both charismatic and absolutely ruthless and is able to visibly show that he seems to be restraining the madness at parts of the film if you know he is actually insane. If you know anything about the story it helps that Scott actually looks quite a bit like William will the makeup on and really can play up his performance. Scott is definitely an actor I would like to see more of in the horror genre and hopefully will be making a return to it in the near future.As the story starts we are shown Bonin being questioned by a woman who wants to know if her son was one of Bonin's victims so that she might have closure if her life. She's been trying to treat him well to get an answer instead of suffering by not knowing before he is put to death as the state's first execution by lethal injection. We are then narrated the story through his eyes, not at the beginning but part way in where he feels it deserves to be told from. In the very first scene you see Bonin pickup two hitchhikers, though we quickly learn that one of them was a friend of his that he has taken under his wing as a co-serial killer.We progress from here through murders when while looking for a victim he sees a young man, Kyle, being berated first by his boss followed by his girlfriend. Kyle is the perfect target for Bonin - a young man with low self esteem. When he finally gets Kyle alone though he sees that he has the potential to be a like him and quickly starts putting him on the track of being a serial killer.Again, this isn't a horror movie with a high amount of gore, suspense, or scares (aside from the fact that serial killers look for the most part like normal people.) It is though a well written, acted, and laid out movie and was quite enjoyable as both a documentary as well as just a look through the eyes of someone who is definitely wrong in the head.",3,Based in history it's got some interesting aspects going on,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2885,"['Directed', 'John', 'Murlowski', 'who', 'few', 'horror', 'movies', 'belt', 'written', 'David', 'Birke', 'who', 'clearly', 'fetish', 'writing', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'having', 'previously', 'done', 'ones', 'Gazy', 'Dahmer', 'others', 'clear', 'duo', 'had', 'experience', 'horror', 'genre', 'past', 'surprise', 'were', 'able', 'put', 'together', 'something', 'was', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'not', 'overly', 'scary', 'gory', 'suspenseful', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'ahead', 'time', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'prison', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'amount', 'suspense', 'run', 'anyone', 'not', 'knowing', 'story', 'ahead', 'time', 'Even', 'real', ""'fright"", 'factor', 'still', 'easily', 'realm', 'horror', 'was', 'very', 'captivating', 'watch.Freeway', 'Killer', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'William', 'Bonin', 'Scott', 'Leet', 'two', 'apprentices', 'trained', 'Vernon', 'Butts', 'Dusty', 'Sorg', 'later', 'life', 'Kyle', 'Cole', 'Williams', 'What', 'absolutely', 'film', 'how', 'Scott', 'William', 'able', 'be', 'charismatic', 'absolutely', 'ruthless', 'able', 'visibly', 'show', 'be', 'restraining', 'madness', 'parts', 'film', 'know', 'actually', 'insane', 'know', 'anything', 'story', 'Scott', 'actually', 'quite', 'bit', 'William', 'will', 'makeup', 'really', 'can', 'play', 'up', 'performance', 'Scott', 'definitely', 'actor', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'horror', 'genre', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'making', 'return', 'near', 'future.As', 'story', 'are', 'shown', 'Bonin', 'being', 'questioned', 'woman', 'who', 'know', 'son', 'was', 'one', 'Bonin', 'victims', 'might', 'have', 'closure', 'life', 'been', 'trying', 'treat', 'well', 'get', 'answer', 'instead', 'suffering', 'not', 'knowing', 'put', 'death', 'state', 'first', 'execution', 'lethal', 'injection', 'are', 'then', 'narrated', 'story', 'eyes', 'not', 'beginning', 'part', 'way', 'where', 'be', 'told', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'see', 'Bonin', 'pickup', 'two', 'hitchhikers', 'quickly', 'learn', 'one', 'was', 'friend', 'taken', 'wing', 'co-serial', 'killer.We', 'progress', 'here', 'murders', 'when', 'looking', 'victim', 'young', 'man', 'Kyle', 'being', 'berated', 'first', 'boss', 'followed', 'girlfriend', 'Kyle', 'perfect', 'target', 'Bonin', 'young', 'man', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'When', 'finally', 'Kyle', 'alone', 'potential', 'be', 'like', 'quickly', 'starts', 'putting', 'track', 'being', 'serial', 'killer.Again', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movie', 'high', 'amount', 'gore', 'suspense', 'scares', 'aside', 'fact', 'serial', 'killers', 'look', 'most', 'part', 'normal', 'people', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'laid', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'documentary', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'look', 'eyes', 'someone', 'who', 'definitely', 'wrong', 'head']",N/A
1298768,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B002XUBDVA,The Piper at the Gates,"[3, 4]","Freeway Killer is one of the better serial killer films I've seen so far. Many of these films that are based on real life serial killers are largely inaccurate and/or the production value is mediocre at best. And though this film isn't overly great, it is a decent flick definitely worth viewing. Of course, the film isn't entirely accurate with the life and crimes of William Bonin, but it seems to be more accurate and factual than most I've viewed. Where the film lets the audience down, however, is the lack of background information on the life of Bonin himself. Only a small amount of info is revealed about his early life and that occurs when the film is nearly over. It's understanding that a film probably couldn't depict every important event of Bonin's life in a 90 min window, but still, some more insight or flashbacks would have been nice. Another major flaw is that film vaguely hints that Bonin was a sex offender, child molester, and that he not only killed his victims, but he tortured and raped them as well. None of these acts are shown, yet only barely implied. And though I understand this isn't a slasher film by any means, the body count here is pretty low. Bonin confessed to killing 21 young men and boys, convicted of 14 of them, and was suspected in about 15 more. Yet, in the film there is perhaps 3 or 4 murders. Again, I'm not expecting to see every murder he did on screen, but this is where some background about Bonin' past would have worked. A series of flashbacks perhaps, or the film could have started from his childhood to begin with, shown his earlier arrests, and shown some of his first murders. Instead, the film seems to only show the last few weeks, maybe days, of Bonin's killing spree. What I did enjoy though was the strong acting performance by Scott Leet as William Bonin. I was definitely impressed with the job he did, and also how much he looked like the actual William Bonin! In a bit of a ironic twist, Michael Rooker appears in this film as a detective, though be it a very small role and has very little screen time. The irony is that Rooker himself played a serial killer in the 1986 film Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. All in all, this is decent flick to watch. There's nothing really outstanding about it, but for these types of lower budget serial killer films, its actually pretty good. Definitely recommended for those interested in serial killers and true crime. However, for a complete overview of the life and crimes of William Bonin, I suggest you do some further reading in addiction to the film.",3,A decent serial killer flick,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,2569,"['Freeway', 'Killer', 'one', 'better', 'serial', 'killer', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'Many', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'largely', 'inaccurate', 'production', 'value', 'mediocre', 'best', 'film', ""n't"", 'overly', 'great', 'decent', 'flick', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'course', 'film', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'accurate', 'life', 'crimes', 'William', 'Bonin', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'factual', 'most', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'Where', 'film', 'audience', 'down', 'however', 'lack', 'background', 'information', 'life', 'Bonin', 'Only', 'small', 'amount', 'info', 'revealed', 'early', 'life', 'when', 'film', 'nearly', 'over', 'understanding', 'film', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'depict', 'important', 'event', 'Bonin', 'life', '90', 'min', 'window', 'still', 'more', 'insight', 'flashbacks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'vaguely', 'Bonin', 'was', 'sex', 'offender', 'child', 'molester', 'not', 'only', 'killed', 'victims', 'tortured', 'raped', 'as', 'well', 'None', 'acts', 'are', 'shown', 'yet', 'only', 'barely', 'implied', 'understand', ""n't"", 'slasher', 'film', 'means', 'body', 'count', 'here', 'pretty', 'low', 'Bonin', 'confessed', 'killing', '21', 'young', 'men', 'boys', 'convicted', '14', 'was', 'suspected', 'about', '15', 'more', 'film', 'perhaps', '3', '4', 'murders', 'Again', ""'m"", 'not', 'expecting', 'see', 'murder', 'did', 'screen', 'where', 'background', 'Bonin', 'past', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'perhaps', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'started', 'childhood', 'begin', 'shown', 'earlier', 'arrests', 'shown', 'first', 'murders', 'Instead', 'film', 'only', 'show', 'last', 'few', 'weeks', 'maybe', 'days', 'Bonin', 'killing', 'spree', 'What', 'did', 'enjoy', 'though', 'was', 'strong', 'acting', 'performance', 'Scott', 'Leet', 'William', 'Bonin', 'was', 'definitely', 'impressed', 'job', 'did', 'also', 'how', 'much', 'looked', 'actual', 'William', 'Bonin', 'bit', 'ironic', 'twist', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'film', 'detective', 'though', 'be', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'irony', 'Rooker', 'played', 'serial', 'killer', '1986', 'film', 'Henry', 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'decent', 'flick', 'watch', 'nothing', 'really', 'outstanding', 'types', 'lower', 'budget', 'serial', 'killer', 'films', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Definitely', 'recommended', 'interested', 'serial', 'killers', 'true', 'crime', 'However', 'complete', 'overview', 'life', 'crimes', 'William', 'Bonin', 'suggest', 'do', 'further', 'reading', 'addiction', 'film']",N/A
1298769,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002XUBDVA,trebe,"[2, 2]","Based on an actual criminal case, Freeway Killer (2010) tells the chilling and disturbing story of a notorious serial killer named William Bonin who lived in California, and preyed on young men.  Bonin would deposit the dead bodies of his victims along the side of major roadways, leading to his gaining the nickname of ""Freeway Killer"".Roughly set in the 1979 through 1980 time period, the film does a fairly good job of recounting some very bizarre happenings, as Bonin (played by Scott Anthony Leet) may have been responsible for over thirty murders.  Bonin would typically befriend young men, offer them rides in his van, provide them marijuana, and them kill them.  Other times he would take them to his home, and murder them there.  Bonin worked alone, and also with several partners, including Vernon Butts (Dusty Song).Unknown to them, some of Bonin's victims walked a strange line between life and death.  In some cases, instead of killing them, Bonin would attempt to get his victims to participate in the murder of another.  The film shows an instance of this, as Kyle Peterson (Cole Williams), a convenience store clerk, is introduced to Bonin's and Butt's world of violence, and then participates in a brutal murder.Bonin's compulsions to kill are overpowering, and lead to a rift between him and Butts, and also with new partner Peterson.  Bonin's extreme recklessness eventually leads to his being suspected by the police, and his arrest while actually choking a victim.The chilling story is told in flashbacks, as while on death row, Bonin has some conversations with a mother who suspects that her missing son was one of his many victims.  The film features several up close and personal kills that spotlights the extreme intensity of the violence, and effectively portrays the taking of life in a realistic and scary way.That all the victims are male, makes for a change of pace from the usual serial killer drama.  The film doesn't specifically address sexual assault, although the real William Bonin did rape some of his victims, and also killed minors.  The movie portrays Bonin as someone who's thirst for blood causes him to become reckless, although why he risked working with various partners, generally remains obscure.  Vernon Butts, who fancied himself as having mystical powers, was apparently also quite an unusual character.  The film doesn't show Butts committing any murders, but he was eventually charged as an accomplice in nine homicides.The film seems to realistically capture, at least some of the madness that possessed William Bonin.  Scott Anthony Leet's edgy performance is chilling, and explosively violence.  Dusty Song, Cole Williams, and Michael Rooker as the officer in charge of the investigation, are all very solid.  The commentary track by director John Murlowski and writer David Birke is helpful in both understanding more about the making of the movie, and the actual case.  Freeway Killer is not a pleasant watch, but it is a very solid, often riveting crime drama with a conclusive ending.
