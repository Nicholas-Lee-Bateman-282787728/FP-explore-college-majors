Admittedly her Mr. Knightly is not as yummy as Jeremy Northam, but her performance is pitch perfect and the simmer of passion under the surface is just right.  Her awakening to her own faults and her relationship with Harriet is also very well done.

Beckinsale's Emma was overly moody and had none of the light cheerfulness of Austen's Emma (or Ms. Paltrow's for that matter). Mark Stong is not Jeremey Northrup but he is VERY good. Unfortunately, this movie never establishes that Mr. Knightly is a daily presence in the Woodhouse household (i.e., compare with the Northrup-Paltrow version), which is critical to understanding the relationship between Mr. Knightly and Emma. Indeed, their love for each other is nearly a shocker in this version coming in its last 10 minutes. If you are an Emma fan, you may find this film a disappointment. In general, I prefer Ms. Beckinsale over Ms. Paltrow but Ms. Paltrow's film is a better Reader's Digest adaptation of this lengthly and rich novel. I wonder if modern movie/DVD audiences have the patience for a longer 4 and 6 hour versions of this novel akin to what has been done for Pride & Prejudice by the BBC and A&E, respectively.

While it is meant to be amusing, ""Emma"" examines the various roles of women in society:  Emma, our heroine, who is wealthy, young and attractive, sees no point in entering into marriage and thus illustrates one of the few Austen characters who is not pressured by finances.  Emma's governess, who is fortunate enough to fall in love AND make a good match with a gentleman above her station.  Additionally, there is the young woman of obscure birth (with hints of illegitimicy)looking to find her station in life and the young woman of good background but poor prospects who is faced with the possibility of offering her services as a governess.Emma wends her way through the story as would-be matchmaker creating not only mischief, but trouble as well.

I finally broke down and purchased the DVD (already had it on VHS), only to be disappointed.  For some reason, this was released as a full screen, old ""pan & scan"" version.  It was reshown on PBS not long ago and it clearly was originally made in some ratio of widescreen.  Don't know why A&E did this, except that in 1997 most TVs where not yet widescreen.  Also the print does look rather dark in some places; but more than that, because of the ""pan & scan"" cutting, one misses so much of the lovely scenery.

I've seen other versions of this novel brought to the screen that did not capture the relationships nearly so well.  Frank Churchill's double entendres, as well as other characterizations and events, are realized more visually; servants and townspeople are seen going about their business; scenes take place outdoors and in the town.  This version really fleshes out the written word and makes Austen -- the ultimate drawing room author -- cinematic, beginning with the marriage of Mr. Weston and Miss Taylor and including Emma's actualized fantasies and daydreams.The only disappointments here are the paltry dvd features: a paragraph about Jane Austen, a list of four A&E; web sites, and optional English subtitles.  That's it.  No cast info, no commentaries, no interviews .... let alone any kind of scholarship from people who have obviously made an authentic commitment to create high quality interpretations of British and American literature.Normally I would demote this item to 4 stars based on the pathetic extras, but this adaptation is to Emma what Merchant-Ivory are to E.M.

Mr Knightley, the eventual romantic interest for Emma, is played by Mark Strong, who does a very good job in the role although I must admit I had trouble seeing him as a romantic lead.  Samantha Morton is very appealing as Emma's shy friend, Harriet.All in all, I give this production four stars.

She's more proper and more restrained than Paltrow.  The scene that sticks in my mind most is her face after Knightley chews her out for being mean to Miss Bates.I definitely preferred this George Knightley.  Davies does a better job of showing Knightley as a person rather than a plot mover; it was far clearer that he was a responsible landowner, riding out to check on his workers and striking up a friendship with a tenant farmer like Robert Martin.  He also feels older than Emma in this version, as it was in the book.  Mark Strong, of course, is an excellent actor and does this character wonderfully.One of the strengths of this version is its Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.  This Frank is good, but then it's not hard to beat the Miramax version, which had me laughing (at it).  Olivia Williams, though, was to me the memorable Jane Fairfax: quiet, put-upon, long-suffering - she captured Jane Fairfax in a nutshell.  Williams' performance drove home what every reader and viewer feels at the end: Jane deserves so much more than that jerk Churchill.  Loved it.Lucy Robinson, fresh from being the annoying yes-woman Mrs. Hurst to Anna Chancellor's Caroline Bingley, is Mrs. Elton; Samantha Morton, Harriet Smith.  Both are good performances, and at least for me, on par with their Hollywood counterparts.  Of course, Harriet drives me nuts with her spinelessness, so I'm not a good person to judge any Harriet Smith.A definite plus: showing Emma's nephew.  A key line running through the novel is Emma's reluctance for George Knightley to marry.  She believes she doesn't want Knightley to marry because of disinheritance; Emma's older sister is married to George's younger brother, and their son (Emma and George's nephew) Henry is George Knightley's heir.  Emma says her primary fear is that Henry will be disinherited if Knightley marries and produces a son, and that is her ostensible reason for opposing Mrs. Weston's suggestion that Knightley favors Jane Fairfax and Harriet's affection for Knightley.  It's not until later she realizes that her own feelings for Knightley are playing as large a role as Henry's disinheritance in her reluctance for him to marry.  This aspect comes out very well in this version of ""Emma"".If I had to choose one (which I didn't; I have both), I'd choose this one.

Enough for me to buy the plot, but not enough to make me really love it (I concede Paltrow's version has the best Emma/Knightley chemistry).The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because the film was too short!

Thurlow,"[4, 5]","A&E;'s 1997 ""Emma"" was unlucky enough to follow 1996's popular big screen production of ""Emma"", starring Gwyneth Paltrow in a sunny, funny turn on Jane Austen's classic romantic comedy.  However, A&E;'s ""Emma"", built for the small screen and starring Kate Bekinsale, has its own distinctions.The storyline is familiar.  Emma is the young, charming, and perhaps too clever daughter of the wealthy and indulgent hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse (Bernard Hepton).  Emma has just managed to marry off her governness as the story opens, and fantasizes about being a match-maker for her friends and neighbors.  Mr. Knightley (Mark Strong), Emma's confidante and brother-in-law, warns her against this, to no avail.  Emma's first target is her friend Harriet Smith (Samantha Morton).  Emma persuades Harriet to reject the marriage offer of Mr. Martin, a honest and hardworking farmer without social status, in favor of the more sophisticated local vicar, Mr. Elton.  This plan collapses, hilariously, when Mr. Elton proposes instead to a horrified Emma.The arrival of the mysterious, handsome Frank Churchill in Emma's small village creates additional complications for Emma, in whom he seems to take a welcome interest, and for Jane Fairfax, a target of gossip who was once the paid companion for a gentlewoman and who must now make her own way.  At a picnic in the country, some rather harsh teasing by Frank Churchill is topped by Emma, who thoughtlessly insults the poor spinster Miss Bates.  The picnic breaks up in confusion, and Emma is properly upbraided by Mr. Knightley for her bad manners.Following the picnic, Emma learns that Frank Churchill has been engaged to Jane Fairfax (in a nice turn by Olivia Williams) all along, and was using Emma for cover.  She also learns that her protege Harriet believes she has drawn the affection of the ever-gentlemanly Mr. Knightley.  In a classic epiphany, Emma realizes that she loves Mr. Knightley and must face the possibility of losing him altogether to Harriet.  The stage is set for a fateful conversation between Emma and Mr. Knightley.A&E;'s Emma is perhaps truer to the spirit of Jane Austen's novel than its big screen competitor.  It is much clearer on the status of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, and by extension on Churchill's misbehavior with respect to Emma.  Mr Knightley is portrayed as a mature gentleman landowner, critical of the much younger Emma's mistakes but also obviously caring.  Emma measures people by social status, and tends to interfere in their lives without understanding the possible consequences.  Her mistake in encouraging Harriet Smith past her social status is clear.  By story's end, she has arrived at some painfully-earned maturity that makes her finally worthy of the man she was meant to be with.This movie is a well-cast quality production highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen.",4,A&E's Emma....,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,2870,"['E', '1997', 'Emma', 'was', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'follow', '1996', 'popular', 'big', 'screen', 'production', 'Emma', 'starring', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'sunny', 'funny', 'turn', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'classic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'However', 'A', 'E', 'Emma', 'built', 'small', 'screen', 'starring', 'Kate', 'Bekinsale', 'own', 'distinctions.The', 'storyline', 'familiar', 'Emma', 'young', 'charming', 'perhaps', 'too', 'clever', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'indulgent', 'hypochondriac', 'Mr.', 'Woodhouse', 'Bernard', 'Hepton', 'Emma', 'just', 'managed', 'marry', 'off', 'governness', 'story', 'being', 'match-maker', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'Mr.', 'Knightley', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Emma', 'confidante', 'brother-in-law', 'avail', 'Emma', 'first', 'target', 'friend', 'Harriet', 'Smith', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Emma', 'Harriet', 'reject', 'marriage', 'offer', 'Mr.', 'Martin', 'honest', 'hardworking', 'farmer', 'social', 'status', 'favor', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'local', 'vicar', 'Mr.', 'Elton', 'plan', 'hilariously', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Elton', 'instead', 'horrified', 'Emma.The', 'arrival', 'mysterious', 'handsome', 'Frank', 'Churchill', 'Emma', 'small', 'village', 'additional', 'complications', 'Emma', 'whom', 'take', 'welcome', 'interest', 'Jane', 'Fairfax', 'target', 'gossip', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'paid', 'companion', 'gentlewoman', 'who', 'must', 'now', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'picnic', 'country', 'rather', 'harsh', 'teasing', 'Frank', 'Churchill', 'topped', 'Emma', 'who', 'thoughtlessly', 'insults', 'poor', 'spinster', 'Miss', 'Bates', 'picnic', 'up', 'confusion', 'Emma', 'properly', 'upbraided', 'Mr.', 'Knightley', 'bad', 'manners.Following', 'picnic', 'Emma', 'Frank', 'Churchill', 'been', 'engaged', 'Jane', 'Fairfax', 'nice', 'turn', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'was', 'using', 'Emma', 'cover', 'also', 'protege', 'Harriet', 'drawn', 'affection', 'ever-gentlemanly', 'Mr.', 'Knightley', 'classic', 'epiphany', 'Emma', 'Mr.', 'Knightley', 'must', 'face', 'possibility', 'losing', 'altogether', 'Harriet', 'stage', 'set', 'fateful', 'conversation', 'Emma', 'Mr.', 'Knightley.A', 'E', 'Emma', 'perhaps', 'truer', 'spirit', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'big', 'screen', 'competitor', 'much', 'clearer', 'status', 'Frank', 'Churchill', 'Jane', 'Fairfax', 'extension', 'Churchill', 'misbehavior', 'respect', 'Emma', 'Mr', 'Knightley', 'portrayed', 'mature', 'gentleman', 'landowner', 'critical', 'much', 'younger', 'Emma', 'mistakes', 'also', 'obviously', 'caring', 'Emma', 'people', 'social', 'status', 'interfere', 'lives', 'understanding', 'possible', 'consequences', 'mistake', 'encouraging', 'Harriet', 'Smith', 'social', 'status', 'clear', 'story', 'end', 'arrived', 'painfully-earned', 'maturity', 'finally', 'worthy', 'man', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'with.This', 'movie', 'well-cast', 'quality', 'production', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Jane', 'Austen']",N/A

Greenbaum,"[1, 3]","Kate Beckinsale's interpretation of the wealthy young lady who finds that matchmaking doesn't always go as one planned and winds up finding love right under her nose is delightful to watch.  Mark Strong plays Mr. Knightley, the slightly unconventional landowner who goes from lecturing Emma to loving her (or perhaps it was both at the same time) in a convincing, reserved fashion.The film contains most, if not all, of the plot elements of the novel.  Unfortunately, to make it fit in an hour and forty minutes or so, there isn't always as much flesh on those bones as one would like, and parts of the plot are hurried over quickly.  One would wish that they had done as they did with the A&amp;E Pride and Prejudice and made this a two-part, four-hour film.  Some of the cuts are ill-made.  After considerable discussion (in novel and film) of Harriet's illegitimate origins, the film never clears it up as the book does.  And, on an opposite note, the romance between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax is made too blatant.  The outcome will hardly be a surprise to the watcher, even the watcher unfamiliar with the book.Granted, Austen has very little use for the lower classes in her books--a servant is never given life, he merely serves to announce a visitor or carry a message.  That's not criticism, that is simply how it is.  But scenes of the lower classes gawking as our more wealthy characters ride through Highbury--or servants gasping as they carry heavy boxes into a house or up a hill--are interesting the first time to set forth the boundaries of Austen's world and indulge in a little commentary on same.  But the fourth time, as servants gasp as they trundle boxes down Box Hill or move pads to cushion the knees of the gentry strawberry pickers at Donwell Abbey--well, enough already.

I had to watch if a few times to really appreciate it, and the scenes where Emma imagines Harriet's future took a while to grow on me.  I tend to be irritated by casting that doesn't fit the descriptions of characters in books, so that can really affect how well I like a movie on the first viewing.From watching previous movies of Emma, I had it in my head for her to be blonde [I think I saw clips of the Paltrow version before ever actually reading the book], but apparently apart from saying she has hazel eyes, Austen never gave much of a physical description of the character.  The casting of the Westons is perfect, and most of the other supporting characters as well, though I have trouble with Hepton as the silly Mr. Woodhouse, after he played such a stern Sir Thomas Bertram in the old BBC ""Mansfield Park.""The casting of Toni Collette as Harriet in the Paltrow ""Emma"" absolutely ruined the movie for me, but Harriet in this one is pretty well portrayed.  Emma and Harriet should probably look a bit younger than they do, but still, it works for me.The ending they contrived for this movie is lovely - a big harvest gathering at Donwell Abbey.  Austen tends to end her stories with a lot of rambling observations and events, but not so much ending ""scenes.""  This leaves movie makers with having to come up with something to wrap up the story, and this one is wonderful.Though I still like the old BBC version of this story best, since it's much longer and is more inclusive of the material from the book, this is my next favorite.

Aside from the slightly jujeune leading lady (which gets her correctly - even Jane Austen knew she was somewhat dislikable), played excellently by Kate Beckinsale, we have the best Jane Faifax in gorgeous and extemely talented Olivia Williams.  William's Jane is highlighted by some of the prettiest music pieces chosen for Jane - which is part of the character's prowess, and ""makes"" her for us as an audience (whether or not she is actually playing it).  And superlatively talented Samantha Morton perfectly cast as the sweet odd-duck.  She is so believably sweet and dim, she is a joy.This version is a bit more wintery and indoor than the version relesed just before it - that one is more summer and green.  But despite some really good performances in the other, this one is so much better on all levels it is silly to compare them.  The Direction here is really good, giving all three of the young heroines some breathing space in their own environment from time to time, which really helps us feel and care for each of them.  And we finally DO care for Emma because she gets a resounding come-uppance.For anyone who thinks Beckinsale's Emma is too dislikable, see the 1970s version - a long, detailed ""play for tv"" version in which Emma is extremely cold, disapproving and you just want to slap her... often.

3859,A2DSXA1E02C86D,0767020308,Joseph Haschka,"[88, 141]","A week or so back, I enjoyed the 1996 cinematic release of EMMA starring Gwyneth Paltrow. (I shall refer to this version as ""E96"".) An Austen-obsessive friend of mine said I MUST see this 1997 version (""E97"") with Kate Beckinsale in the title role. So, unsolicited, she mailed me her own personal copy to view at my earliest convenience, which I interpreted as immediately. Sigh -  friendship's demands are a heavy load. However, since the storyline of E97 is pretty much like E96, I can provide the same synopsis.Beckinsale plays Emma Woodhouse, who lives with her father at Hartfield, an example of the country manor house common to all Austen storylines. Having just engineered the marriage of her governess to a rich neighbor, the 21- year old Emma decides to take up match making as a career. After all, it's Regency England and there's not much for a genteel single lady to do to allay rural boredom. Drawing pints at the local pub to build up the college fund isn't an option. Anyway, most needful of assistance is best friend Harriet Smith (Samantha Morton), a respectable enough girl of dubious lineage for whom Emma has plans. Perhaps she can maneuver Harriet into marrying the vicar, Reverend Elton (Dominic Rowan), rather than the local hayseed whom she loves. Meddling in affairs of the heart is a sticky wicket, but someone has to do it, especially in the absence of a licensed yenta.And what of Emma's own romantic prospects? There appear to be none in the virtual hail of misdirected cupid's arrows. True, Hatfield hosts the frequent visits of the 30-something Mr. Knightley (Mark Strong), a well-mannered and well-heeled bachelor from down the carriage road. But he's Emma's brother-in-law, a long standing relationship that seems to preclude anything of prurient interest. And he occasionally scolds Emma for her bratty behavior. Hmm, perhaps they're made for each other. You think?I'm giving E97 the same number of stars, four, as I gave E96, and for the same reason, which is that the screen versions of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE (1996), SENSE & SENSIBILITY (1995), and MANSFIELD PARK (1999) are better in comparison.The costuming, sets and props of this EMMA seemed more authentic than the previous, but that's an impression based on no expertise whatsoever. Perhaps it was the lighting, which, in E96, seemed more luminescent. And E97's screenplay did more to develop the nuances of the relationships between the various players, but not so much that it made any difference in my lackadaisical appreciation of Austen's works as a whole. Strong's Knightley was a more interesting character than Jeremy Northam's in E96. While the former was no less a gentleman than the latter, this Knightley had a more smoldering intensity. Some latent kinkiness, perhaps? Morton's Smith was more endearingly pathetic than Toni Collette's in the earlier rendering. And E97 links Emma's final happiness to some imaginary (or not?) chicken thieves. A nice touch, that.The bottom line to my comparison has to be GP versus KB in the lead. The latter's Emma  took herself and her mission much more seriously, and verged on being annoyingly snooty in the process. Paltrow's Emma, on the other hand, had a blithely lighter touch. It's as if she was giving the audience a wink and an elbow's nudge. I would much rather spend an afternoon on the English heath with a picnic basket and GP's Emma than KB's.

3865,ASLTUNWNRTUOY,0767020308,J. Walsh,"[16, 19]","I was originally introduced to Jane Austen's Emma when it was on my reading list in college many years ago. I enjoyed it, but I was then more interested in action stories than in parlor romances, no matter how well written. Even then, however, I marvelled at how Austen uncovered the emotions and motivations of her characters with such beauty and facility of language.With the inexorable passage of time my tastes have evolved, and now I am less enamored with action and more with depth of emotion and meaning. Hence, on a day like today as I am home with the flu, I gravitate toward quality films like ""Emma"" to pass the time. With both the Paltrow and the Beckinsale versions of the film here at hand, I watched them both.Though I do enjoy Gywneth's acting and hold her performance in ""Shakespeare in Love"" to be superb, she has less to work with in this film. Against the Kate Beckinsale version, which I am primarily interested in applauding, her's pales in comparison.This film, which stars the Kate Beckinsale whom I first met in ""Much Ado About Nothing"" as Hero, is rich with attentiveness to Austen's story. It maintains to a great degree the story's language with the dialogue often just as the author wrote it. In addition, the setting amongst some of the more splendid period homes in England lends to it an authenticity that helps with that all so needed suspension of disbelief. The acting and casting are solidly excellent with Mr. Knightly believable in both age and nobility and Beckinsale an ideal choice as a charmingly effective Emma. This version is the one to watch.

3869,A3EFDLX43LT7OM,0767020308,Kathryn Atwood,"[35, 38]","I was thrilled when the Gwenyth Paltrow version of ""Emma"" came out.  After all, I knew from reading the book that it was a great story and I was one of those Austenites reveling in the rich array of Austen adaptations created in the mid to late 90's.  When my husband bought me this version, my first thought was, ""Emma doesn't look gorgeous.""  She was supposed to be breathtakingly so.  But as soon as I stopped looking at the cover and popped the movie into the VCR, I was hooked (as I realized that the beautiful Ms. Beckinsale might have just taken a less-than-worthy photograph for the cover).  Not was I only hooked, but this version became by far my favorite.For one thing, it is much truer to the book. It baffled me that the screenwriters of the Paltrow version had the chutzpah to think they could improve on Jane Austen.  This major flaw somehow slipped past me during my adaptation-induced euphoria and became apparent only after I watched the Paltrow film again after viewing the A&E;, a film that remains wonderfully faithful to the book in every possible way.  And although much had to be cut, one never gets that sense of choppiness that inevitably comes with the adaptation territory.  There is genuine inventiveness involved in shortening the story; it moves quickly, but never feels rushed or cut up and pasted.Some of the characters in the Gwenyth Paltrow version at times seem either ill-cast or two-dimensional.  Jane Fairfax is supposed to be reserved but generally admired.  Emma doesn't like her, but that is simply because Emma is still maturing.  In the A&E; version, you can see why Emma dislikes her: she's elegant, poised, musically skilled and yes, rather reserved, but there is nothing in her personality that would generally give cause to complaint.  Jane, in the Paltrow version, appears sneaky and suspicious in a very two-dimensional way, as if desperate to show the audience that she's hiding something.Harriet Smith is only slightly miscast in the Paltrow film but the actress's biggest problem here are the writers who felt the need to create gratuitously ridiculous scenes for her which added nothing but a few laughs.  How hysterical!:  Harriet is helping Emma minister to the poor and sick and she's freaking out so badly she's falling over!  Now she's posing for her portrait dressed in a ridiculous outfit and looking confused!Samantha Morton, A&E;'s Harriet, is exactly as I pictured her: attractive, innocent, naive and because these screenwriters had more respect for the book, she is always placed exactly where Austen meant her to be.Sophie Thompson is a wonderful actress and does a humorous, if somewhat two-dimensional portrayal of the chattery Miss Bates in the Paltrow version.  But just putting some spectacles on her face and tying up her hair in a bun can't hide the fact that she's much too young for the part.  The Paltrow version also erroneously shows her snubbing Emma after the infamously rude comment on Box Hill.  Miss Bates was much more gracious and forgiving than that, a fact well portrayed by the more accurate A&E; version, whose Miss Bates is perfectly cast and who gives a wonderful performance.Who is the superior Emma?  My opinion is Kate Beckensale.  My husband, a Jane Austen fan by marriage, would vote for Paltrow.  Paltrow does bring a certain ditziness to the character which is very much in keeping with the book.  Beckensale comes off more sure of herself, but Emma was quite headstrong in her wrong-headness, so both potrayals are valid.One very nice touch, not in the book, mind you, but nice all the same is the ending: a supper/engagement party/dance at Mr. Knightly's.  All the major players are there and it wraps up the story perfectly.",5,Excellent version of Emma,1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,3726,"['was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'Gwenyth', 'Paltrow', 'version', 'Emma', 'came', 'out', 'knew', 'reading', 'book', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'Austenites', 'reveling', 'rich', 'array', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'created', 'mid', 'late', '90', 'When', 'husband', 'bought', 'version', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'Emma', ""n't"", 'look', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'breathtakingly', 'so', 'as', 'soon', 'stopped', 'looking', 'cover', 'popped', 'movie', 'VCR', 'was', 'hooked', 'realized', 'beautiful', 'Ms.', 'Beckinsale', 'might', 'have', 'just', 'taken', 'less-than-worthy', 'photograph', 'cover', 'Not', 'was', 'only', 'hooked', 'version', 'became', 'far', 'favorite.For', 'one', 'thing', 'much', 'truer', 'book', 'baffled', 'screenwriters', 'Paltrow', 'version', 'had', 'chutzpah', 'think', 'could', 'improve', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'major', 'flaw', 'somehow', 'slipped', 'adaptation-induced', 'euphoria', 'became', 'apparent', 'only', 'watched', 'Paltrow', 'film', 'again', 'viewing', 'A', 'E', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'faithful', 'book', 'possible', 'way', 'much', 'had', 'be', 'cut', 'one', 'never', 'sense', 'choppiness', 'inevitably', 'adaptation', 'territory', 'genuine', 'inventiveness', 'involved', 'shortening', 'story', 'quickly', 'never', 'feels', 'rushed', 'cut', 'up', 'pasted.Some', 'characters', 'Gwenyth', 'Paltrow', 'version', 'times', 'seem', 'ill-cast', 'two-dimensional', 'Jane', 'Fairfax', 'supposed', 'be', 'reserved', 'generally', 'admired', 'Emma', ""n't"", 'like', 'simply', 'Emma', 'still', 'maturing', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Emma', 'elegant', 'poised', 'musically', 'skilled', 'yes', 'rather', 'reserved', 'nothing', 'personality', 'would', 'generally', 'give', 'cause', 'complaint', 'Jane', 'Paltrow', 'version', 'sneaky', 'suspicious', 'very', 'two-dimensional', 'way', 'desperate', 'show', 'audience', 'hiding', 'something.Harriet', 'Smith', 'only', 'slightly', 'miscast', 'Paltrow', 'film', 'actress', 'biggest', 'problem', 'here', 'are', 'writers', 'who', 'felt', 'need', 'create', 'gratuitously', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'added', 'nothing', 'few', 'laughs', 'How', 'hysterical', 'Harriet', 'helping', 'Emma', 'minister', 'poor', 'sick', 'freaking', 'out', 'so', 'badly', 'falling', 'Now', 'posing', 'portrait', 'dressed', 'ridiculous', 'outfit', 'looking', 'confused', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'A', 'E', 'Harriet', 'exactly', 'pictured', 'attractive', 'innocent', 'naive', 'screenwriters', 'had', 'more', 'respect', 'book', 'always', 'placed', 'exactly', 'where', 'Austen', 'meant', 'be.Sophie', 'Thompson', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'humorous', 'somewhat', 'two-dimensional', 'portrayal', 'chattery', 'Miss', 'Bates', 'Paltrow', 'version', 'just', 'putting', 'spectacles', 'face', 'tying', 'up', 'hair', 'bun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'fact', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'part', 'Paltrow', 'version', 'also', 'erroneously', 'snubbing', 'Emma', 'infamously', 'rude', 'comment', 'Box', 'Hill', 'Miss', 'Bates', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'gracious', 'forgiving', 'fact', 'well', 'portrayed', 'more', 'accurate', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'Miss', 'Bates', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'who', 'wonderful', 'performance.Who', 'superior', 'Emma', 'opinion', 'Kate', 'Beckensale', 'husband', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fan', 'marriage', 'would', 'vote', 'Paltrow', 'Paltrow', 'bring', 'certain', 'ditziness', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'keeping', 'book', 'Beckensale', 'off', 'more', 'sure', 'herself', 'Emma', 'was', 'quite', 'headstrong', 'wrong-headness', 'potrayals', 'are', 'valid.One', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'not', 'book', 'mind', 'nice', 'same', 'ending', 'supper/engagement', 'party/dance', 'Mr.', 'Knightly', 'major', 'players', 'are', 'there', 'up', 'story', 'perfectly']",N/A

3878,A3I41MF1O2FAC,0767020308,"Laura Merucci ""marspeach""","[8, 9]","This version of Emma weirdly came out in the same year as the Gwyneth Paltrow film. But other than being based on the same book, the two adaptations really have nothing in common. While the film version was all comedy and lightness, this TV version is really quite dark. I mean that both literally and figuratively. Maybe it's because of the poor video quality, but the picture is usually quite dark. This makes sense, I suppose, to have realistic candle light at night-time scenes. But the scenes in the day-time aren't that bright either.Andrew Davies, the screenwriter, chose to do something very different with this Emma. He focuses a lot on the class system, which was always there in the context of the book, but I thought it was a bit heavy-handed in this adaptation. All the underclass workers-servants, farmers, etc.- are clearly present in every scene, making the way of life for the privileged possible. They're even moving pillows for them to kneel on in the strawberry picking scene. Emma makes sure to tell Harriet that Mr. Knightley owns EVERYTHING in Donwell, and all the other people who live there are merely his tenants or servants. Robert Martin seems very resentful of Emma, like he knows she advised Harriet to refuse him. He glares at her when she drops Harriet off at the farm. It's a big deal at the end when Emma shakes hands with him. This class system was in the background in the book and I'm not fond of Davies' idea to play it up (but I did think Emma and Robert Martin shaking hands was a nice touch). It's just not what I want to see when I watch a Jane Austen adaptation.This is far from my favorite Emma adaptation. Aside from all the darkness, I wasn't fond of most of the cast. It was also very short and while I know things need to be condensed, it felt very rushed and the Crown Ball scene was poorly done, IMO. Harriet is dancing in the beginning, then Elton snubs her, then Mr. Knightley dances with her for less than a minute before walking away! Blink and you'll miss it. The ending scene was also rather weak- a harvest ball with Mr. Knightley making a speech to all his tenants (stressing again how many people depend on him) that he will still keep everything running smoothly even after he moves to Hartfield. Well, at least I can say that at least Andrew Davies didn't add any sexed up scenes.I was not a fan of Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong as the leading characters. Beckinsale's Emma was too cold and Strong's Knightley was way too harsh. The one saving grace of the cast was the beautiful Olivia Williams as Jane Fairfax. She was sublime and elegant despite being dressed plainly.I do like this one better than the 1972 miniseries, but really, that's not saying much. It does have its fans though, and I can understand their point of view, even if I don't share it.

Bernabo,"[15, 18]","Do I really have to choose between this version of &quot;Jane Austen's Emma&quot; and the Gwyneth Paltrow film that came out the previous year?  They each have their merits, and their detractors, and if I had to isolate the key factors in making the decision I would point to two.  First, you ability to countenance an American actress affecting an English accent, which is a deal buster for many on the theatrical film.  Second, and, I believe, more importantly, it comes down to which one you saw first, because of the old familiarity breeds contempt theorem.I saw the film version first, and for me the most memorable scene was when Emma heartlessly insults Miss Bates at the picnic.  After all, it is not often that the heroine you are rooting for does something as brutal as what Emma does and her reprimand at the hands of Mr. Knightley (&quot;Badly done, Emma&quot;) is the story's most memorable line.  The two scenes are effective in each version and they underscore the essential difference between the two.  In this version Emma (Kate Beckinsale) and Mr. Knightly (Mark Strong) are clearly more old school, both in lookis and demeanor, than Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam representing the younger generation in the other (I know there are those who want to make the pick based on the physical attractiveness of the leading character of the opposite gender, but I based that decision on intelligence and they are both saying basically the same lines, so that is also too close to call).Actually, the best distinction is between the actresses playing Harriet Smith, Samantha Morton (who did the title role in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; that same year) for A&amp;E and Toni Collette (the title character in &quot;Muriel's Wedding&quot;) in the film.  This really crystalizes the question for me, because clearly the film version is &quot;Emma&quot; by way of &quot;Clueless.&quot;  This version has more gravity and I certainly consider Beckinsale's Emma to be the better catch.  However, Paltrow does give more of a sense of the character's joy at matchmaking and imposing her views and plans on everyone else.

But this earlier adaptation, with the wonderful script by Andrew Davies, is still the best. Davies has a genius for preserving period language, which, in Austen's case particuarly, is crucial to period drama. This is only one reason why I prefer this over the 2009 version, whose screenwriters have modernized and, in my opinion, dumbed down Austen's language.This version is not only perfectly cast, but perfectly acted--all the characters are portrayed exactly as Austen wrote them. Production values, of course, are top drawer, and the musical score is appropriately suited to the period. (Another unfortunate trend these days, besides modernizing the language, is using music that is jarringly modern.)Despite glowing customer reviews of the 2009 version, this one is still the most faithful in terms of language and character portrayal.

PRETTY face, okay?  This insipid looking young woman just won't do at all.

Emma is the daughter of a wealthy man in good social status in the small town of Highbury.  In the beginning her governess( Miss Taylor) is getting married to a  man of great social stature.  Emma had played matchmaker and considers the wedding her own achievement.  Her friend Mr. Nightly tells her she simply made a lucky guess and nothing more.  However her mind does not change and she is determined to find (the minister) Mr. Elton a bride as well.  Her mind is made up when she meets sweet simple Miss Harriet Smith the natural daughter of someone and not that respectable.  Once she and Harriet become friends, Harriet is proposed to by a farmer(from Mr. Nightly's estate)named Robert Martin.  Emma convinces Harriet to refuse him because her is below her station.  Nightly tells her she has not done her friend a service.  Harriet is later rejected by Mr. Elton because he loves Emma.  When Emma finds out she is shocked, and tells off Mr. Elton who storms away.  He later marries a woman named Augusta for her money.  Harriet eventually marries Robert Martin.  Emma likes a man named Frank Churchill for a while ,but he was secretly betrothed to another girl(Jane Fairfax).

Yes, we all know that Emma is 16 years Mr. Knightley's junior, and he has known her since she was a child. However, when revealing his love for Emma, Mr. Knightley says he held her in his arms when she was a baby and Emma replies, ""I hope you like me better now"" my reaction was EWWW!!!Meanwhile back at the review... I recently had something of an Emma marathon. This version of Emma tries to be fairly faithful to Jane Austen's novel, but then they tried to fit it all into a movie that's not quite 2 hours. You either need to cut some of the subplots, like the Gwyneth Paltrow adaptation, or you need to allot more time, like the 1972 or 2009 BBC adaptations. This movie felt very rushed to me, and the two scenes that suffered the most are the two that make or break an adaptation of Emma for me.The first scene is the ball. In this version everything felt rushed, the dance, Mr. Knightley's rescue of Harriet from embarrassment, and Emma's thank you to Mr. Knightley all seemed to take place at break-neck speed. The second is the aforementioned garden scene. Besides having the previously mentioned cringe-inducing exchange, the whole thing takes place so quickly. Mr. Knightley rushes, practically runs, out of the house to see Emma and says his lines so fast I was starting to wonder if the scene was being directed with a stopwatch (OK, take 3 let's see if we can shave another 15 seconds off the scene this time...).It really is a shame that things had to be so rushed, because there was a very good cast and the production values were top notch. The biggest problem here is that Mark Strong as Mr. Knightley just didn't work. He seemed to play the character more like Mr. Darcy, than Mr. Knightley. Also, there just wasn't any chemistry between Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong, and I think it ended up hurting my perception of Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of Emma.The costumes, the props, the locations and sets were all fantastic, and I enjoyed a number of the performances. I think that Samantha Morton is possibly my favorite Harriet Smith. However, in this type of movie everything hangs on the chemistry of the leads, and it just isn't there.So unfortunately, I can't highly recommend this movie. If it's your first time to see this story, I would recommend either the superb 2009 BBC mini series starring Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller, or the charming theatrical release starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam instead of this adaptation.

John Knightley was well played indeed, his line in the carriage as they travel to the Weston's is so funny, makes me laugh each time, he's so sarcastically pessimistic!If I had to find something to criticize , it would be the last scene, where Emma and Frank Churchill meet again- you don't get the same sense that he knows he's done wrong as you do in the book.

He might not have Northam's classically handsome silhouette but, to borrow an Austen phrase, he does possess a pair of hypnotic, 'fine eyes'.

I'd purchased this ""Emma"" dvd title several months ago after reading the book, but have since seen the Gwynth Paltrow film and the Romola Garai series.  I also sat through ""Clueless"" since it is frequently refered to in discussions of this Austen title.All adaptations mentioned have something to offer my tastes, but this Kate Beckinsale version is most satisfying to me.  I wish it was a longer film to allow a little more completion.  I agree with many that it seems most faithful to the novel in dialog and intent.  Literary criticism of Jane Austen novels often reminds modern readers to remember the always present servant and laboring classes.  Contemporary readers of Jane Austen didn't need to be reminded or to have servant characters explicitly included in the novels.  They would have been as naturally assumed then as we take for granted the presence of electricity or automobiles in stories of the 20th century. This film remembers to include these working class citizens in the lives of the principal characters.  I read the novel and never ""disliked"" Emma or Frank Churchill, even though I disagreed with their behavior sometimes.  This adaptation allows Frank to be liked, forgiven, and included in the future family circle(s).I recently purchased/watched a more recent Jane Austen film biography titled ""Miss Austen Regrets"", circa 2008, starring Olivia Williams as Jane Austen.  I very much recommend that film.  Approximately 12 years earlier she was cast as Jane Fairfax in this adaptation of ""Emma"".  Every man has his tastes in beautiful women.
