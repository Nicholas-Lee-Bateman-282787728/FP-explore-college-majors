781446,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0000E6EL3,Anyechka,"[18, 18]","This film opens and closes with footage from a Czech news program in 1998, talking about Righteous Gentile Nicholas Winton, who saved 669 children from the Nazis in the late Thirties, and reuniting him with some of those very children he saved, who are now old.  He would have saved even more than that had WWII not broken out in September of 1939, as he had had plenty of more names of children to be saved and transported to safety on his lists.  However, to save these children, Mr. Winton had to convince their parents to do the unthinkable, to say goodbye to them and send them away on a train alone, to a strange new country (England), where they didn't speak the language, didn't know anybody, and would be taken into the homes of strange families they had never met.  One of those 669 children was David Silberstein, whom we meet in this film.  His parents, Jakub and Irma, have a comfortable, rather privileged life (his father is a doctor, after all), and a big happy family.  David's other loved ones include his older sister Hedvica, who is always going to the movies to make out with her boyfriend (later husband) Robert, who works as a projectionist, his uncle Leo, who is a cantor, his uncle Sam, who is a successful violinist, his uncle Max, who is somewhat of an itinerant wanderer, rather like a Gypsy, and his best friend Sosha Klein, his childhood sweetheart (a rather cute little girl).  Like most families in Europe at the time, the Silbersteins too think that what's happening in Nazi Germany won't happen in a civilised place like Czechoslovakia, even after the Germans invade their homeland and gradually start making life harder for them.  However, since this film takes place entirely in the late Thirties, and is told through the eyes of a child, we never see anything very bad happening.  Things did not really start to get really bad in Czechoslovakia for a few years more; most Czech Jews were still living in their own houses, even with increasing persecution and restrictions, until 1942.  The bad things that happen are things like the Silbersteins' car getting taken by Nazis, a little German boy throwing a knife into one of their trees over and over again, and Uncle Sam's beautiful young Gentile fianc&eacute;e Alenka (who is about half his age) breaking the engagement because of pressure from her father and because, as Sam puts it, her fear was stronger than her love.The main focus of the film is the happy normal life this family enjoys just prior to the end of innocence, making it a more subtle portrayal of these years than one normally expects from such films.  Many films about these years seem to start with normal life but then move into more and more horror and sadness, but not so here.  It also moves back and forth between the respective characters instead of putting all of the focus on the storyline of Nicholas Winton convincing Irma and Jakub to make the arrangements so David can be put on one of the trains going to safety in England before it's too late.  That storyline only really comes into focus towards the end of the film, when Uncle Sam introduces his friend Mr. Winton to his brother and sister-in-law, urging them to save David, even if they may be convinced nothing bad is going to happen to them and find it foolish to try to leave their homeland just because their people are being persecuted yet again.Though this film does move a bit slowly, and may annoy some viewers by how it jumps back and forth between the different characters and their storylines instead of staying focused on one main plot, this kind of cinematic approach can work very effectively at really drawing the viewer into the story unfolding, making him or her truly care about these different characters and what happens to them.  I only wish that there have been some kind of epilogue, even with just text on the screen, telling us about the respective fates of David's loved ones, even knowing that David was the sole survivor of his family.  It kind of leaves the viewer hanging, wondering what exactly happened to them after the war began, if they tried to leave or go into hiding, how long they survived, if Robert and Hedvica went through with it and tried to cross into Slovakia, just about the only safe border that was left, to fulfill their dream of going to Palestine, and if their baby were a boy or a girl.  The film really ends just as the viewer is really getting involved in these people's lives.  My only other problem was how, on the back of the DVD, the blurb actually twice says ""The Silberstein's"" when clearly it meant ""The Silbersteins.""  It's so embarrassing when errors like this make their way into print, since it only encourages people who genuinely think that an apostrophe makes a word plural, and other just-as-basic grammatical errors that no one out of elementary school should still be making.  Extras include a number of trailers, photo galleries, and filmographies for Rupert Graves (Nicholas Winton) and Josef Abrh&aacute;m (Dr. Jakub Silberstein).",4,An important story,1166572800,"12 20,

At long last, The Silbersteins make a last attempt to save David by putting him up for adoption in Great Britain, thanks to English stockbroker Nicholas Winton, who saved hundreds of children through this method.This movie is very historically accurate, and is also a very good story.But, I must warn you, be ready to cry your heart out!!!",5,All My Loved Ones,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,732,"['My', 'Loved', 'Ones', 'story', 'young', 'Czech', 'boy', 'named', 'David', 'Silberstein', 'large', ""'family"", 'start', 'movie', 'meet', 'David', 'family', 'such', 'best', 'friend', 'Sosha', 'course', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'little', 'little', 'nazis', 'begin', 'take', 'control', 'Jews', 'life', 'starting', 'small', 'things', 'such', 'cars', 'working', 'up', 'David', 'father', 'Dr.', 'Silberstein', 'job', 'long', 'last', 'Silbersteins', 'make', 'last', 'attempt', 'save', 'David', 'putting', 'up', 'adoption', 'Great', 'Britain', 'thanks', 'English', 'stockbroker', 'Nicholas', 'Winton', 'who', 'saved', 'hundreds', 'children', 'method.This', 'movie', 'very', 'historically', 'accurate', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'story.But', 'must', 'warn', 'be', 'ready', 'cry', 'heart']",N/A
781448,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000E6EL3,Grady Harp,"[20, 21]","Writer Jir&iacute; Hubac and Director Matej Minac have created a fine and very different approach to the Holocaust stories of WW II - its insidious origins and relentless destruction of a beautiful Czech family - in the film 'Vsichni moji bl&iacute;zc&iacute;' ('All My Loved Ones').  Though the subject matter has been treated in countless films, this relating of the story of a large, happy, well adjusted family in Prague and its gradual disintegration does not dwell on atrocities of the camps but instead slowly unwinds the story of how Hitler's masterplan overtook and crushed so many innocent people.The Silbersteins include a physician and his wife and son, a brother who is a gypsy of sorts, another brother who is a concert violinist and falls in love with a non-Jew, accepted by his family but eventually rejected by her and her family because of the pogrom, and all manner of extended family circling in the warmth of the good life in 1939.  Very gradually the Nazis take over the Czech borders, not really heeded by the Silbersteins ('no one could be as mad as Hitler may seem') and gradually the evacuation and genocide of the Jews begins.  Dr Silberstein is introduced to an American Nicholas Winton (Rupert Graves) who has come to Prague to save the children by providing them safe transport to America. The Silbersteins reluctantly release their son when they see that is his only hope for survival: the remainder of the family's future is doomed.  The rest of the film deals primarily with the homage to Winton, showing the real man and the many of the 600 children he rescued.  It is deeply moving.The color and camera work is elegant and very much in keeping with the film's emphasis on the dignity of the Silberstein family.  The acting by this Czech troupe is excellent, never cloying, always sensitive to the very human response to the black cloud of the Third Reich's Holocaust.  In every way this is a film to treasure. Highly recommended.

781449,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0000E6EL3,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[2, 2]","This is a familiar story told with elegance and poignance - about a well-to-do Jewish family in Prague in the late 1930s, as Nazism looms and in the final moments of the film overwhelms them. The joys and sorrows, meanwhile, are those of almost any extended family with brothers pulled in different directions, ranging from a doctor and a concert violinist to an amateur inventor. Another brother shows up who has been on the road with his own carnival.The predictability of the story is countered by rapid scene changes and an attempt to follow the lives of several family members, so that one family crisis quickly falls on the heels of another. The story of Englishman Nicholas Winton, whose efforts saved 669 Jewish children, is only partially told. We meet him briefly at the start of the film and he appears again near the end. The emphasis is on the family, remembered in the voice-over narration of one of those children saved.

There were alot of them and the film did alot of bouncing around from one to the other. This was a little different from other Holocaust movies in that we do get a real sense of the loving family life that is slowly destroyed. I thought the silly mother weeping because the kids got into the jam was good counterpoint to later depiction of, as they say, ""having something to cry about.""I also wanted to know what happened to everyone, and where they died. What happened in 1942? How were the Jews able to stay free until then, as we see Sosha walking on the street and looking fine. I know the old and the very young were sent to death immediately, poor poor Sosha, but the two women and all of the men were young and strong, and it seems kind of odd that not one of them survived. I also thought, since the film took place in the late thirties, how David's father knew at that time what David's fate would be if he didn't leave the country. I am a firm believer that everyone in the world knew what was going on as time went on, but unfortunately no one cared, not even the US. I don't know how David's father could have known so early on that they would all be killed. I wanted them to insist that Sosha go with David, even if they couldn't find her on the list. I knew as soon as they said she wasn't on the list what her fate would be.",3,Good,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,1436,"['thought', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'keeping', 'characters', 'straight', 'were', 'alot', 'film', 'did', 'alot', 'bouncing', 'one', 'other', 'was', 'little', 'different', 'other', 'Holocaust', 'movies', 'do', 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'loving', 'family', 'life', 'slowly', 'destroyed', 'thought', 'silly', 'mother', 'weeping', 'kids', 'got', 'jam', 'was', 'good', 'counterpoint', 'later', 'depiction', 'say', 'having', 'something', 'cry', 'about', 'also', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'everyone', 'where', 'died', 'What', 'happened', '1942', 'How', 'were', 'Jews', 'able', 'stay', 'free', 'then', 'see', 'Sosha', 'walking', 'street', 'looking', 'fine', 'know', 'old', 'very', 'young', 'were', 'sent', 'death', 'immediately', 'poor', 'poor', 'Sosha', 'two', 'women', 'men', 'were', 'young', 'strong', 'kind', 'odd', 'not', 'one', 'survived', 'also', 'thought', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'late', 'thirties', 'how', 'David', 'father', 'knew', 'time', 'what', 'David', 'fate', 'would', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'country', 'am', 'firm', 'believer', 'everyone', 'world', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'went', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'cared', 'not', 'even', 'US', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'David', 'father', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'so', 'early', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'killed', 'wanted', 'insist', 'Sosha', 'go', 'David', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'list', 'knew', 'as', 'soon', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'list', 'what', 'fate', 'would', 'be']",N/A
781451,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0000E6EL3,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","All My Loved Ones is an unusual Holocaust movie in that it doesn't really focus so much on the horrors that Nazism wrought in the lives of the Jews in occupied Prague, rather centers on an ordinary Jewsih family, the Silbersteins, and how they led a rather normal existence before the horrors of Nazi occupation began to be felt.The story centers on young David Silberstein who enjoys an idyllic childhood in 1939 Prague with his best friend Shosha. David enjoys being the doted only son of his parents, a doctor, and a housewife. He has a sister and four uncles, Sam, a renowned violinist, Max, a religious Jew, another uncle who leads a gypsy-like existence, and lastly, the inventor. He also has two loving grandparents. Life seems pretty normal until the Nazis under Adolf Hitler begin their territorial expansion [the Anschluss, taking over the Sudetenland, and eventually invading Czechoslovakia].Things change very rapidly for the Silbersteins - David's father can no longer treat patients with insurance, and Sam the violinist loses not only his job but also his Aryan fiancee, and a chance meeting between Sam and a Briton Nicholas Winton, helps save David's life.Though the story of Nicholas Winton occurs towards the end of this movie, it is very significant for it shows how one individual with foresight was able to mobilise the rescue of about 669 mostly Jewish Czech children from almost certain death in a Czech version of the Kindertransport.An earlier reviewer mentioned that there wasn't any information given about the fate of David Silberstein's family. From my viewing of the movie, it is hinted right at the end of the movie.Besides this movie, there is also a documentary The Power of Good: Nicholas Winton (S&iacute;la lidskosti) that deals with his rescue efforts.
