843740,A178KV00J5LEKS,B0002RQ2S0,"Blindguy07 ""Bob""","[0, 0]","I didn't see too many episodes of this particular season of Xena when it was on tv.  I was a 10th grader in Highschool and had too much work to do, but I remember being facinated that the writers were actually planning to put an end to the gods.  I think the first episode from the fifth season I'd seen was God Fearing Child which I absolutely loved.  My drama instructor, who knew a heck of alot more about both Herc and Xena than I did and probably ever will because she's such a big fan, helped me out with all the questions I had concerning previous episodes.  I'd seen most of the episodes dealing with Hercules and Zeus thanks to her letting me borrow some of them, and I enjoyed the final battle between father and son.  I wish we could have seen Hercules again after Gfc, and in a way I guess we kinda did in those modern day episodes, but still, I would have loved to see Herc helping Xena out in the three part finale of this season.  I mean, wasn't he full god then?  And what the heck happened to Hera?I was shocked when I learned of Callisto's final character development this season.  But it was a welcome one.  She had suffered so much, and yeah, I shed a few tears when she was finally reunited with her family and free of the hatred after so many years.  I'd have loved to see her in a few more episodes.  She makes a very interesting protagonist.I wish Xena could have fought a bit more with Discord Damos and Hades before destroying them.  Yeah, I might not know what's going on half the time, but I enjoy mortals beating the stuffing out of Olympians as much as the next blind guy.  All that to say this.

843742,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0002RQ2S0,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 0]","Xena never ceases to amaze me. After four previous seasons you would think you've just about seen all the possible marvelous deeds of the beautiful and deadly Warrior Princess wouldn't you? Well not so, imagine Xena as an Archangel fighting beside the highly esteemed Michael, or maybe an Arch Demon battling the forces of good for ownership of heaven. It could never happen you say? You'd be wrong, in `Fallen Angel' the first episode of season five she does both after being crucified on a cross. What does that dying on a cross part remind you of? I shouldn't say it but I simply cannot resist, Xena died for our sins.And that's just to wet the appetite in a season that sees the redemption of Callisto, the birth of Xena's baby girl, a twenty-five year hibernation period for the Warrior Princess and side-kick Gabrielle catapulting them into the future, the death of Joxer, hearing Ares say ""I love you"" and the demise of the Olympian God's.

843744,AKHNTRZDH67XX,B0002RQ2S0,Cathy Young,"[61, 65]","Season 5 is probably my second favorite Xena season, after Season 3. Xena and Gabrielle literally go to hell and back, and that's just in the season opener.  Xena has a mystery child and is hunted by the gods -- and then, after a miraculous 25-year sleep, has to face both her own grown daughter and the gods as adversaries.  In the meantime, Gabrielle grows into a warrior and Ares grows a heart.There are a lot of fan complaints about this season.  Yes, it had its share of duds like ANIMAL ATTRACTION, PURITY/BACK IN THE BOTTLE, and LIFEBLOOD/KINDRED SPIRITS, and Xena's discovery of her pregnancy was handled rather badly (there really should have been more suspicion that the mystery baby could be evil). However, I thought the Twilight of the Gods arc was excellent, even if aspects of it could have been done better.  I loved the Livia/Eve story and the interaction between Xena and Ares.  The late, lamented Kevin Smith did a great job playing Ares with greater layers of complexity, as the God of War confronts both the specter of mortality and his feelings for Xena.  There was also a great new character, Athena, wonderfully played by Paris Jefferson. CHAKRAM, SEEDS OF FAITH, AMPHIPOLIS UNDER SIEGE, and LOOKING DEATH IN THE EYE/LIVIA/EVE/MOTHERHOOD are among my favorite Xena eps.So, I love the season.  Now, the DVD set (which I have had a chance to view because I pre-ordered it directly from Davis-Anderson).The sound/picture quality is great, no complaints there.  The extras, though, don't quite measure up to Season 3.  Some of the season's best episodes such as AMPHIPOLIS UNDER SIEGE and LOOKING DEATH IN THE EYE have no extras (interviews or commentary) at all.  As in Season 4 only four of the episodes have audio/video commentary, compared to seven in S3. I was particularly disappointed that there were no interviews with Steve Sears (he did leave early in the season but I would have liked to hear his insights on SUCCESSION), nothing with Paris Jefferson, and only one little tidbit from Ted Raimi -- I would have loved to see him talk about playing old Joxer.On the plus side, the commentaries were a lot of fun.  No earth-shattering insights perhaps, but some very interesting observations about the show and the characters and some very enjoyable banter betwen Lucy Lawless, Renee O'Connor and Rob Tapert, and also between producers Eric Gruendemann and R.J. Stewart on FALLEN ANGEL.  Some of the interviews are great as well; I especially enjoyed the comments from Hudson Leick (Callisto), Adrienne Wilkinson (Livia/Eve), and writer/producer Chris Manheim.Unfortunately there are no bloopers with this season set.  There was some interesting deleted footage from MOTHERHOOD, but I can't for the life of me understand why they'd choose to show deleted/alternate footage from ANIMAL ATTRACTION rather than a much better episode such as SEEDS OF FAITH (which apparently had a very interesting scene of Ares training Gabrielle) or CHAKRAM.  We do, however, get a 100th ep B-roll for SOF with good behind the scenes footage.",4,"Excellent, but leaves a few things to be desired...",1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,3050,"['Season', '5', 'probably', 'second', 'favorite', 'Xena', 'season', 'Season', '3', 'Xena', 'Gabrielle', 'literally', 'go', 'hell', 'back', 'just', 'season', 'opener', 'Xena', 'mystery', 'child', 'hunted', 'gods', 'then', 'miraculous', '25-year', 'sleep', 'face', 'own', 'grown', 'daughter', 'gods', 'adversaries', 'meantime', 'Gabrielle', 'warrior', 'heart.There', 'are', 'lot', 'fan', 'complaints', 'season', 'Yes', 'had', 'share', 'duds', 'ANIMAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'PURITY/BACK', 'IN', 'THE', 'BOTTLE', 'LIFEBLOOD/KINDRED', 'SPIRITS', 'Xena', 'discovery', 'pregnancy', 'was', 'handled', 'rather', 'badly', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suspicion', 'mystery', 'baby', 'could', 'be', 'evil', 'However', 'thought', 'Twilight', 'Gods', 'arc', 'was', 'excellent', 'even', 'aspects', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'loved', 'Livia/Eve', 'story', 'interaction', 'Xena', 'Ares', 'late', 'lamented', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Ares', 'greater', 'layers', 'complexity', 'God', 'War', 'confronts', 'specter', 'mortality', 'feelings', 'Xena', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'new', 'character', 'Athena', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Paris', 'Jefferson', 'CHAKRAM', 'SEEDS', 'OF', 'FAITH', 'AMPHIPOLIS', 'UNDER', 'SIEGE', 'LOOKING', 'DEATH', 'IN', 'THE', 'EYE/LIVIA/EVE/MOTHERHOOD', 'are', 'favorite', 'Xena', 'eps.So', 'love', 'season', 'Now', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'view', 'pre-ordered', 'directly', 'Davis-Anderson', 'sound/picture', 'quality', 'great', 'complaints', 'there', 'extras', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'Season', '3', 'season', 'best', 'episodes', 'such', 'AMPHIPOLIS', 'UNDER', 'SIEGE', 'LOOKING', 'DEATH', 'IN', 'THE', 'EYE', 'have', 'extras', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'Season', '4', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'have', 'audio/video', 'commentary', 'compared', 'seven', 'S3', 'was', 'particularly', 'disappointed', 'were', 'interviews', 'Steve', 'Sears', 'did', 'leave', 'early', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'insights', 'SUCCESSION', 'nothing', 'Paris', 'Jefferson', 'only', 'one', 'little', 'tidbit', 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'talk', 'playing', 'old', 'Joxer.On', 'plus', 'side', 'commentaries', 'were', 'lot', 'fun', 'earth-shattering', 'insights', 'perhaps', 'very', 'interesting', 'observations', 'show', 'characters', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'banter', 'betwen', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'Renee', ""O'Connor"", 'Rob', 'Tapert', 'also', 'producers', 'Eric', 'Gruendemann', 'R.J.', 'Stewart', 'FALLEN', 'ANGEL', 'interviews', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'comments', 'Hudson', 'Leick', 'Callisto', 'Adrienne', 'Wilkinson', 'Livia/Eve', 'writer/producer', 'Chris', 'Manheim.Unfortunately', 'are', 'bloopers', 'season', 'set', 'was', 'interesting', 'deleted', 'footage', 'MOTHERHOOD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'understand', 'why', ""'d"", 'choose', 'show', 'deleted/alternate', 'footage', 'ANIMAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'rather', 'much', 'better', 'episode', 'such', 'SEEDS', 'OF', 'FAITH', 'apparently', 'had', 'very', 'interesting', 'scene', 'Ares', 'training', 'Gabrielle', 'CHAKRAM', 'do', 'however', 'get', '100th', 'ep', 'B-roll', 'SOF', 'good', 'scenes', 'footage']",Xena Warrior Princess - Season Five

843763,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0002RQ2S0,P. Hardy,"[6, 11]","Xena's fourth season (arguably the best season next to the third) ended with the shocking death of the Warrior Princess and her best friend Gabrielle via crucifixion by order of Julius Caesar who's death also followed theirs in the so famous ""stabbing"" provided to him by his would-be faithful Romans and long time friend Brutus. From there Season Five opens with a rather impressive first episode ""Fallen Angel"" which highlights' Xena and Gabrielle's near ascension to the pearly white gates of God (or The God Of Light in this series) only to be deterred by a horde of Devils led by the maniacal Callisto, who skillfully separates the duo. The season opener was amazing, however, this cannot be said about Xena's fifth season. If anything the writers fumbled miserably with the Warrior Princess' character and the storylines themselves. Perhaps and as harsh and irrational as it may sound to others, Lucy Lawless picked a lousy time to get pregnant.Seriously, her pregnancy basically killed whatever hopes this season had of carrying on the ""excellent streak"" the series had. Nothing about season five was very coherent in the ways that the previous and last season was: If anything it focused perhaps far too much of Gabrielle with Lawless being pregnant and her character near useless in series until her child's birth. I felt as though they tired far too hard to force on us the ""warrior path"" Gabrielle had chosen, and the character herself became lost in the muddle of the so called ""evolution"" thrown at me, curtesy of the writers. While, yes, Gabrielle finally being able to defend herself is always a plus, her sudden ability of combat and use of the Sai's were unlogical. Despite the fact that she indeed rode with Xena for Four years, Gabrielle is never shown taking a bit of interest in Xena teaching her fighting skills (it was quite the opposite in fact). The petty squabbles between Xena and Gabrielle were arbitrary drama, especially in episodes like ""Seeds of Faith"" or ""Succession"" and ""Back in the Bottle,"" all of which were dull episodes. ""The Twilight Of The Gods"" story arc was probably the best out the entire season, aside from the occasional glitch in the system with the storyline (The Miraculous conception of Xena's baby because she saves Callisto from torment in Hell and the sudden power to kill Gods, given to her by a messenger of a GOD himself. I mean, what gives ""God"" in Xena?).That aside, all twenty-two minus episodes were like episode fillers surrounding Gabrielle since Xena's pregnancy was something to poke fun at with a stick. From getting writers block in ""Punch lines"" - to becoming Goldie Hawn in ""Married with Fishsticks,"" the so called evolution of Gabrielle from peace loving side kick with a staff to demi-warrior with Ralphel's twin sai's is lost in the haze shameless humor and arbitrary drama concerning the character. When baby Eve is born, its all breast-feeding and running from the Gods of Olympus for the Warrior Princess who finally steps back into the limelight as a fighter, but a fighter who has become consideringly meek and more geared to pleading with Ares and others to save her child, compared to how she was previously. Other characters of the series are immediately killed off as the series since their presence are not important to the writers nor the series any longer. A more prominent example is in the episode ""Eve"" - Joxer is killed straight away by Xena's evil daughter, Liva ""champion of Rome,"" without remorse. Indeed the worse thing is his getting killed is that he was in the middle of Xena's attempt to rescue Gabrielle herself! While this never occured to me during the viewing, I realize its a lousy way to kill off a character. In spite of his annoying demeanor, his death was indeed held shock value. I would've felt perhaps worse for the Gods if they had not changed a majority of the actors with unrecognizable actors with the exception of ""Discord,"" - ""CGI Poseidon,"" and ""Athena,"" who I felt worse for at the season finale than anything (Athena, I mean).The character Liva/Eve would've been a great catalyst for the show as well if the writers had paid more attention to detail to the ""why"" this character did a ""Callisto and Xena"" and slaughtered Eli's followers for Rome. Instead in the course of the episode following ""Livia"" (""Eve"") we are thrown a horrible ending for the dark side of the character. Her being shown the light by the powers of Eli's spirit and suddenly accepting her rightful name and weeps over her evil deeds screams ""last minute writing."" However, S5 manages to redeem itself with a gripping episode like ""Motherhood"" which showcases Xena using ruthless force to protect her guilt-ridden daughter from all enemies, including her best friend. Xena hitting Gabrielle with her chakram instead of choosing the later is in itself is creepy and almost hard concept to grasp, given the relationship between Xena and Gabrielle, but understandable if you look at from a desperate mother's point of view. While ""Motherhood"" was riddled with plot problems ultimately tying with the Furies and Destruction of the Gods save two and others, it showcased some of the best action scenes this season EVER! Other positives of Season of Five include the appearance of Hercules (Kevin Sorbo) in ""God fearing Child"" and Alti (Claire Standsfield?) in ""Them Bones, Them Bones.""1. Fallen Angel - 4/52.

843764,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002RQ2S0,Robert Moore,"[7, 8]","Warning!  Spoilers ahead!Season Four of XENA had been disappointing after a riveting Season Three, primarily because a long string of flat episodes in the middle of the season.  Season Five, despite real life complications caused by Lucy Lawless's pregnancy, was not only a great return to form, but a great improvement in its dramatic arcs.  Season Three was the series best season for comic episodes, but Seasons Five and Six took the dramatic arcs to the show's highest points.This is the season where the payoff from the Season Four introduction of Eli bears fruit.  The Eli arc structures the series in its final two seasons as much as any other aspect of the show excepting Xena and Gabrielle's deep relationship.  His message of self-reliance framed in the context of relationships of love and without the need for the Olympian gods culminates in the death of Eli (at the hand of Ares in the show's 100th episode) and the growing influence of Eli's teachings.  Eli's bearing more than a little physical resemblance to traditional representations of Jesus is not accidental, with John the Baptist in Season Six shown as a follower of Eli.  And it is his teaching on how humans do not need the Gods combined with the Fates' prophesy that Xena's child will cause the downfall of the Olympians that generates one of the most compelling story arcs in the entire run of the series:  the attempted destruction of Eve by the Gods.XENA was never a show unwilling to take risks, but perhaps the single greatest risk the show ever took was ""Looking Death in the Eye"" and the two episodes that followed it, ""Livia"" and ""Eve.""  In these, in an attempt to protect Eve from Athena, Hades, and the other Olympians, Xena and Gabrielle fake their own deaths.  But their plans goes awry when Ares, who is unaware that they are feigning their deaths, takes both of them to icy coffins on an isolated mountain peak, and then seals the tomb.  When a landslide awakens them from their long sleep, they discover that twenty-five years have passed.  Eve had been raised by Octavius, who is now known as Augustus Caesar while she is now known as Livia.  The Olympian gods, who have long thought that Eve was dead, have ceased looking for her.  The final episodes of the season deal with Xena and Gabrielle convincing Eve that Xena is her mother and that she, who as Livia has been a persecutor of the followers of Eli, was prophesied to be Eli's messenger.  The season ends with Xena having been granted the ability to kill gods through the purification of Eve.  These arcs will all arise again in Season Six as Xena dispatches the Olympians with the unexpected assistance of some of the gods.Season Five was a good one despite the presence of two of the stinkiest episodes I've ever seen on TV.  ""Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire,"" the second and by far the weakest of the two XENA musical episodes (the first was actually quite good) is the only episode of XENA that I've never been able to finish.  But as bad as it was, ""Married with Fishsticks"" makes it look like a masterpiece.  If I were asked to name the worst episode of any series that I have ever seen, I without hesitation would choose ""Married with Fishsticks.""  In it, Gabrielle, who is unconscious after being hit in the head and nearly drowned, imagines she is the mermaid mother in a family consisting of Joxer and three half human/half sea creature children.  In the commentaries accompanying the discs the crew and creative staff insist that XENA fans either love or hate the episode, but I simply do not believe them.  Everyone I have ever talked to despises the episode.  When most watch the episode, they scratch their heads and wonder what drugs were involved in inspiring it.XENA is one of the more unique series in the history of TV.  Its greatest claim to fame was providing TV with the first convincing female action hero in the history of TV, with the possible exception of Mrs. Emma Peel.  But it raises multiple challenges to anyone who attempts to enjoy it.  Whether you can enjoy or appreciate the show depends on suspending one's disbelief on several levels.  For instance, that Xena and Gabrielle could have encountered in their lifetime such famous (and noncontemporary) individuals as King David, Goliath, Julius Caesar, Virgil, Homer, Euripides, Odin, Grendel, Beowulf, Ulysses, Pandora, Brutus, Marc Antony, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, and Augustus, not to mention Hercules and the full range of Olympian gods.  Also, to steal a phrase from Firesign Theater, that everything you know [about history] is wrong.  You have to be willing to accept that in this alternative universe Xena was the pivotal figure in the Battle of Actium, that it was Xena impersonating Cleopatra who ensnared Marc Antony, and that all the members of both triumvirates were engaged with one another at the same time.  Furthermore, you have to believe that a warrior can make 50 foot forward somersaults.  I'll confess that I found the history a bit easier to take over time, but I was never able to find anything like a comfort level with the wirework that made the absurd jumps possible.  I was much more comfortable with the kind of fighting and stunts found on BUFFY, which resembled more the real world.  Or KILL BILL, in which Zo Bell, Lucy Lawless's stunt double in XENA, doubled Uma Thurman.  But some fans never struggle believing anything they see in XENA.  And there is nothing wrong with that.The great thing for all fans, regardless of their capacity for suspension of disbelief, is that unlike the relatively flat Season Four, this season was fully back on track.  And the arcs begun in the second half of the season were played out through Season Six until the end of the entire series.",5,One of the strongest seasons in the entire run of the show,1186963200,"08

843765,A1YVSRX09MZABR,B0002RQ2S0,S. Donovan,"[0, 0]","Xena is one of the most enjoyable, inspiring, action-packed, fun-filled, romantic shows ever to grace the small screen. I admit, when I began watching Xena, I was very skeptical. Initially, I found the character Gabrielle more an irritant than anything else. But character evolution is where the talent of the writers really shines.  Gabrielle matures and becomes a warrior in her own right, a mirror image of the darker, more violence-prone Xena. By the show's finale (Friend In Need) Gabrielle has won over the hearts and minds of Xena fans the world over.Very gradually, X:WP develops, depending on how one looks at it, it is unfolds as epic romance between two women, or the greatest friendship the world has ever seen. Regardless of how you see Xena and Gabrielle, this show is about the love shared between two people, a theme as old as time itself. It is also about accountability for one's past, making amends for one's wrong doings, turning away from violence, and the absolute stupidity/futility of war.X:WP has it all, too. Drama, comedy, tragedy: deep, soul stirring tragedy that will bring tears to your eyes. Lucy Lawless is a talented singer who had formal training. Her voice adds greatly to the musical episodes. In addition, the man who composed the musical scores (Joseph LoDuca) is a genius. The musical score is available on amazon as well.I only see a few drawbacks. The first goes to the heart of the show itself, and is echoed by so many X:WP fans. Be warned, once you watch this show, you'll discover there is no other like it. Search all you want, there are no other heroes comparable to Xena and Gabrielle.The next will hopefully be corrected when the series is remastered. Some of the sets do not have closed captioning and that can be a real problem, especially when it comes to the extra material. Further, I understand that the sound quality of some of these sets is less than optimal. Many have commented that the sets produced by Universal are captioned and have better sound quality.For the men and women who have loved Xena for all of these years, this is a worthwhile investment to keep Xena alive in your hearts. In addition, the sound track to the tv show continues to be available and is a very worthwhile addition for fans who loved LoDuca's pieces. Finally, many well written stories continue to be written by fans of Xena and Gabrielle. All you need do is google ""Xena fan fiction"" to access the work of the many talented bards who found their voice thanks to the show Xena Warrior Princess.",5,I love Xena,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,2533,"['Xena', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'inspiring', 'action-packed', 'fun-filled', 'romantic', 'shows', 'ever', 'grace', 'small', 'screen', 'admit', 'when', 'began', 'watching', 'Xena', 'was', 'very', 'skeptical', 'Initially', 'found', 'character', 'Gabrielle', 'more', 'irritant', 'anything', 'else', 'character', 'evolution', 'where', 'talent', 'writers', 'really', 'shines', 'Gabrielle', 'matures', 'warrior', 'own', 'right', 'mirror', 'image', 'darker', 'more', 'violence-prone', 'Xena', 'show', 'finale', 'Friend', 'Need', 'Gabrielle', 'won', 'hearts', 'minds', 'Xena', 'fans', 'world', 'over.Very', 'gradually', 'X', 'WP', 'depending', 'how', 'one', 'unfolds', 'epic', 'romance', 'two', 'women', 'greatest', 'friendship', 'world', 'ever', 'seen', 'Regardless', 'how', 'see', 'Xena', 'Gabrielle', 'show', 'love', 'shared', 'two', 'people', 'theme', 'as', 'old', 'time', 'also', 'about', 'accountability', 'one', 'past', 'making', 'amends', 'one', 'wrong', 'doings', 'turning', 'away', 'violence', 'absolute', 'stupidity/futility', 'war.X', 'WP', 'too', 'Drama', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'deep', 'soul', 'stirring', 'tragedy', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'talented', 'singer', 'who', 'had', 'formal', 'training', 'voice', 'greatly', 'musical', 'episodes', 'addition', 'man', 'who', 'composed', 'musical', 'scores', 'Joseph', 'LoDuca', 'genius', 'musical', 'score', 'available', 'amazon', 'well.I', 'only', 'see', 'few', 'drawbacks', 'first', 'heart', 'show', 'echoed', 'so', 'many', 'X', 'WP', 'fans', 'Be', 'warned', 'once', 'watch', 'show', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'other', 'Search', 'want', 'are', 'other', 'heroes', 'comparable', 'Xena', 'Gabrielle.The', 'next', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'corrected', 'when', 'series', 'remastered', 'sets', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'closed', 'captioning', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'problem', 'especially', 'when', 'extra', 'material', 'Further', 'understand', 'sound', 'quality', 'sets', 'less', 'optimal', 'Many', 'have', 'commented', 'sets', 'produced', 'Universal', 'are', 'captioned', 'have', 'better', 'sound', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'loved', 'Xena', 'years', 'worthwhile', 'investment', 'keep', 'Xena', 'alive', 'hearts', 'addition', 'sound', 'track', 'tv', 'show', 'be', 'available', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'fans', 'who', 'loved', 'LoDuca', 'pieces', 'Finally', 'many', 'well', 'written', 'stories', 'continue', 'be', 'written', 'fans', 'Xena', 'Gabrielle', 'All', 'need', 'do', 'google', 'Xena', 'fan', 'fiction', 'access', 'work', 'many', 'talented', 'bards', 'who', 'found', 'voice', 'thanks', 'show', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess']",Xena Warrior Princess - Season Five

I come across only two episodes on Season 5 that were totally off.  LifeBlood and Antony & Cleopatra.  Lifeblood made no sense at all, having a 20th centuary girl in the past, and Antony & Cleopatra was just not that great of a plot.  Besides these two this season is the best.  The season finale and premiere are packed with action.  This is a great season, with a musical in it.  Ignore all the reviews that say this season is bad.  If you like season's 1 through 4, you should like this too.  Succession and Motherhood are my two favorite episodes of this season.  I can't wait for Season Six to come out.
