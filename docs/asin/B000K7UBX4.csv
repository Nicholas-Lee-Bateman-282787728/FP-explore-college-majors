1031298,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B000K7UBX4,A. Gammill,"[63, 64]","It's hard to put into words the effect Beauty & The Beast had on a relatively small, but passionate group of people almost 20 years ago.  I proudly count myself among them.  But for someone who isn't all that familiar with the show, or even a casual viewer, re-creating the magic with words seems a daunting task.Once Upon a Time, Ron Koslow took the seeds of an age-old fairly tale and planted them in the modern urban landscape of New York City.  At this time (1987) there were just the ""Big Three"" networks of ABC, CBS and NBC.  Oh, there were cable stations, and Twentienth Century Fox was testing the waters with their own network.  But the majority of primetime network dramas were formulaic ""cop"" shows or nighttime soaps like Dynasty.  CBS took a huge risk on this odd little fantasy show, and placed it in what sci-fi and fantasy fans have come to know as the ""kiss of death"" timeslot: Friday nights.For its first season, the show was a moderate hit, moreso with critics (and the aforementioned loyal followers) than mainstream audiences.  The romance between ""beauty"" Linda Hamilton and ""beast"" Ron Perlman was handled with intelligence and compassion.  Here was a show that was not ""dumbed down"" to appeal to a wider audience.  In addition to their romance, Koslow and a talented staff of writers created an entire world of great characters, most of them living beneath the city in underground tunnels.The show took a hit, however, when the writer's strike of 1988 delayed the start of the second season until December of that year.  Most fans would agree that the quality of the episodes was never higher, but the ever-important Nielsen ratings were falling.  To make matters worse, a creative ""retooling"" for the abbreviated third season--which saw the departure of star Hamilton--alienated many of the show's original fans.But that's another story.What is great about the show in general, and season one in particular, is the chemistry between the leads.  I watch an awful lot of television, and I challenge anyone to find a better romantic pairing.  Beyond that, this was a show that inspired many people to learn more about art, music and literature (all were featured prominently in the stories).  Beauty & The Beast also featured an amazing supporting cast, including Roy Dotrice, Jay Acovone and the always-impressive Armin Shimerman (fans who only know him from his Buffy and Deep Space Nine roles may be quite surprised to see a much gentler side of this talented actor).Like I said, I watch a lot of t.v.  And I can't really think of a show I can recommend higher than Beauty & The Beast.  What started as a high-risk venture become a phenomenon which burned brightly, and all-too-briefly.  They simply don't make t.v. like this anymore.Oh, and kudos to Paramount for the seemingly impossible task of cramming a full SIX single-sided discs into a standard DVD case!  As a long-time home-video enthusiast, I take a certain perverse pleasure in being able to store an entire season of a show in less space than one single-episode videotape used to occupy.",5,"Welcome Back, Old, Dear Friends...",1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,3075,"['hard', 'put', 'words', 'effect', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'had', 'relatively', 'small', 'passionate', 'group', 'people', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'proudly', 'count', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'show', 'even', 'casual', 'viewer', 're-creating', 'magic', 'words', 'daunting', 'task.Once', 'Time', 'Ron', 'Koslow', 'took', 'seeds', 'age-old', 'fairly', 'tale', 'planted', 'modern', 'urban', 'landscape', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'time', '1987', 'were', 'just', 'Big', 'Three', 'networks', 'ABC', 'CBS', 'NBC', 'Oh', 'were', 'cable', 'stations', 'Twentienth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'was', 'testing', 'waters', 'own', 'network', 'majority', 'primetime', 'network', 'dramas', 'were', 'formulaic', 'cop', 'shows', 'nighttime', 'soaps', 'Dynasty', 'CBS', 'took', 'huge', 'risk', 'odd', 'little', 'fantasy', 'show', 'placed', 'what', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'kiss', 'death', 'timeslot', 'Friday', 'nights.For', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'moderate', 'hit', 'moreso', 'critics', 'aforementioned', 'loyal', 'followers', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'romance', 'beauty', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'beast', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'was', 'handled', 'intelligence', 'compassion', 'Here', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'dumbed', 'down', 'appeal', 'wider', 'audience', 'addition', 'romance', 'Koslow', 'talented', 'staff', 'writers', 'created', 'entire', 'world', 'great', 'characters', 'most', 'living', 'city', 'underground', 'tunnels.The', 'show', 'took', 'hit', 'however', 'when', 'writer', 'strike', '1988', 'delayed', 'start', 'second', 'season', 'December', 'year', 'Most', 'fans', 'would', 'agree', 'quality', 'episodes', 'was', 'never', 'higher', 'ever-important', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'were', 'falling', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'creative', 'retooling', 'abbreviated', 'third', 'season', 'saw', 'departure', 'star', 'Hamilton', 'alienated', 'many', 'show', 'original', 'fans.But', 'story.What', 'great', 'show', 'general', 'season', 'one', 'particular', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'watch', 'awful', 'lot', 'television', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'find', 'better', 'romantic', 'pairing', 'Beyond', 'was', 'show', 'inspired', 'many', 'people', 'learn', 'more', 'art', 'music', 'literature', 'were', 'featured', 'prominently', 'stories', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'also', 'featured', 'amazing', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Roy', 'Dotrice', 'Jay', 'Acovone', 'always-impressive', 'Armin', 'Shimerman', 'fans', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'Buffy', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'roles', 'may', 'be', 'quite', 'surprised', 'see', 'much', 'gentler', 'side', 'talented', 'actor', '.Like', 'said', 'watch', 'lot', 't.v', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'show', 'can', 'recommend', 'higher', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'What', 'started', 'high-risk', 'venture', 'become', 'phenomenon', 'burned', 'brightly', 'all-too-briefly', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 't.v', 'anymore.Oh', 'kudos', 'Paramount', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'task', 'cramming', 'full', 'SIX', 'single-sided', 'discs', 'standard', 'DVD', 'case', 'long-time', 'home-video', 'enthusiast', 'take', 'certain', 'perverse', 'pleasure', 'being', 'able', 'store', 'entire', 'season', 'show', 'less', 'space', 'one', 'single-episode', 'videotape', 'used', 'occupy']",N/A

I hate to see anyone ever miss such a tale that can bring men down to squalling babies. Everyone must see this show. It was always my favorite. I tried to get it on VHS Now I will have it on DVD! I cannot wait. Each week looking forward to seeing a man I was falling in love with myself. This is the shows that make Television. Every week, we have Linda Hamilton, the asst. D.A, and her beloved Beast, watching and saving the poor out in the streets of the City. So sexy, entertaining, just the most fabulous show I could have ever imagined that could make the waves of the Television scene, yet keeping up each week with all the originality that is so unique, only better. Seemingly sultry, and exciting, in the dark, as they run thru the pipes in the underground world created,  just for the people that have nowhere to go, with a man called Father, whom took care of his people as a King would back in the days of King Arthur. Yet his Beauty living up above in a beautiful city co=op. Yup, that is what I said. Watch her doing her job to stop the evil in the city above, until that fated night where they meet and she is immediately drawn to his goodness. And eventually they start to fight together. An amazing tale and one that when seen, my husband a burly Italian man,  would  sit on the couch and actually have tears streaming down his face as I did too, sitting together watching, never missing an Episode. Watching every season, until that horrid day when it was gone.  Now I get to have it and see it any day I want.The Ultimate show! EPIC, like no other.

1031314,A38B6JNQA3USU7,B000K7UBX4,Edward Waters,"[4, 5]","Although long rumoured to have had only women devotees, in fact BEAUTY AND THE BEAST remains to this day my own favourite American television serial as well. It debuted in 1987, during perhaps the most EXTERNALLY oppressive period in my wife's and my entire marriage. Feeling alienated from so much around us, we drew deeper into our already close relationship and spent countless hours together reading aloud, listening to good music, and drinking MANY pots of tea. So this programme about a couple estranged from the 'normal' world -- whose love, nigh-mystical understanding of one another, and taste for simple joys were so like our own -- was deeply encouraging. Then too, its many literary allusions actually advanced our own interest in classic literature. I credit the scripts with our appreciation of everything from Shakespeare's 29th sonnet to Rilke's LETTERS TO A YOUNG POET to THE VELVETEEN RABBIT.Of course, the show was not flawless. Its earliest episodes suffered from excessive Beast-to-the-rescue plotlines; and after Linda Hamilton's departure, the truncated third and final season was seriously marred by a misguided decision to escalate action and violence, presumably in hope of better ratings. The serial's middle run was by far its best, focusing on Vincent and Catherine's deeply-romantic yet functionally-platonic relationship, the intriguing history of the tunnel community, and the mysterious wonders and perils of the vast realms even further Below. Yet, whatever its strengths and weaknesses, that the programme came to be at all was a blessing beyond hope in a medium so often glutted with mere ugliness and inanity.

1031318,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000K7UBX4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[33, 33]","In September of 1987, television viewers saw something a bit different as CBS debuted the modern update of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. This new show unveiled the story of two people, intrepid lawyer Catherine Chandler and the ""Beast"" Vincent, and their often hazardous adventures in the city of New York and in the underground, labyrinthine network of tunnels beneath the city, which housed an organized community of outcasts who eked out a meager existence without the knowledge of the surface dwellers. Now, to look at that premise, the assumption made by the casual audience was that this new series would center predominantly on action- and suspense-oriented sequences. However, while there were scenes that raised testosterone levels, it quickly became obvious that the main thrust of the show would revolve around the platonically romantic relationship between beautiful Catherine Chandler (Linda Hamilton, TERMINATOR and TERMINATOR 2) and gentle but inhumanly lion-faced and -maned Vincent (Ron Perlman).When New York attorney Catherine Chandler is assaulted and left for dead, she later wakes up to find herself being tended to by Vincent and his mentor, Father, deep in the many-tunneled sanctuary beneath the city. She learns of the secret community dwelling in the Tunnels and promises to keep that knowledge secret. She returns to the world above but discovers that she has somehow formed an empathic bond with the reclusive Vincent. Her experience in the Tunnels transforms the previously carefree and  rudderless attorney, as her social consciousness is elevated. She joins the DA's office and becomes an investigative lawyer. Her various cases for the DA often places her in jeopardy, and it's usually up to Vincent to come to her rescue. A given episode usually ends with the two having a lyrical conversation on Catherine's balcony.This short-lived series (only 56 episodes, for two full seasons and a truncated third one) drew rave reviews from critics and mass adoration from viewers, none of whom were more vocal and fiercely loyal than the core of female audiences. The show boasted excellent, intelligent acting by the supporting cast (Roy Dotrice as Father, Jay Acovone as Joe Maxwell, David Greenlee as Mouse...) and luminous turns by Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman, who were both classically trained and showed it with erudite, soulfully-acted performances. It was very evident that the two stars hurled every fiber of their beings into their roles. The chemistry they had and the yearning wistfulness which colored their every word and gesture made their star-crossed plight that much more romantic. And, of course, as a demonstration of how doomed their love really was, Catherine was done away with in the third season, which is when I stopped watching it (no offense to newcomer and Hamilton-replacement Jo Anderson).I'd be remissed if I didn't give props to the writing. The writers consistently came up with episodes that were literate, magical, and involving. The lushness with which the underground world and its denizens was painted greatly abetted the rich, shadow-laden tone of the show, as the tunneled environment almost became yet another supporting character. And the characters themselves were so well written, they seemed to breathe the same air as you and I. Vincent, Catherine, Father...after two decades, they're still in my brain.In hindsight, it was probably best that this show didn't last long. As it was, it burned briefly but incandescently. And now, the enthralling complete first season is on a 6-disc dvd set so that you and I may again experience this show's heart, literacy, integrity, and enchantment. So, thanks, Paramount.",5,"""He comes from a secret place, far below the city streets, hiding his face from strangers...""",1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,3675,"['September', '1987', 'television', 'viewers', 'saw', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'CBS', 'debuted', 'modern', 'update', 'BEAUTY', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'new', 'show', 'unveiled', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'intrepid', 'lawyer', 'Catherine', 'Chandler', 'Beast', 'Vincent', 'often', 'hazardous', 'adventures', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'underground', 'labyrinthine', 'network', 'tunnels', 'city', 'housed', 'organized', 'community', 'outcasts', 'who', 'eked', 'out', 'meager', 'existence', 'knowledge', 'surface', 'dwellers', 'Now', 'look', 'premise', 'assumption', 'made', 'casual', 'audience', 'was', 'new', 'series', 'would', 'center', 'predominantly', 'action-', 'suspense-oriented', 'sequences', 'However', 'were', 'scenes', 'raised', 'testosterone', 'levels', 'quickly', 'became', 'obvious', 'main', 'thrust', 'show', 'would', 'revolve', 'platonically', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'beautiful', 'Catherine', 'Chandler', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'TERMINATOR', 'TERMINATOR', '2', 'gentle', 'inhumanly', 'lion-faced', '-maned', 'Vincent', 'Ron', 'Perlman', '.When', 'New', 'York', 'attorney', 'Catherine', 'Chandler', 'assaulted', 'left', 'dead', 'later', 'wakes', 'up', 'find', 'being', 'tended', 'Vincent', 'mentor', 'Father', 'deep', 'many-tunneled', 'sanctuary', 'city', 'secret', 'community', 'dwelling', 'Tunnels', 'promises', 'keep', 'knowledge', 'secret', 'world', 'discovers', 'somehow', 'formed', 'empathic', 'bond', 'reclusive', 'Vincent', 'experience', 'Tunnels', 'previously', 'carefree', 'rudderless', 'attorney', 'social', 'consciousness', 'elevated', 'DA', 'office', 'investigative', 'lawyer', 'various', 'cases', 'DA', 'often', 'jeopardy', 'usually', 'up', 'Vincent', 'come', 'rescue', 'given', 'episode', 'usually', 'two', 'having', 'lyrical', 'conversation', 'Catherine', 'balcony.This', 'short-lived', 'series', 'only', '56', 'episodes', 'two', 'full', 'seasons', 'truncated', 'third', 'one', 'drew', 'rave', 'reviews', 'critics', 'mass', 'adoration', 'viewers', 'none', 'whom', 'were', 'more', 'vocal', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'core', 'female', 'audiences', 'show', 'boasted', 'excellent', 'intelligent', 'acting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Roy', 'Dotrice', 'Father', 'Jay', 'Acovone', 'Joe', 'Maxwell', 'David', 'Greenlee', 'Mouse', 'luminous', 'turns', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'who', 'were', 'classically', 'trained', 'showed', 'erudite', 'soulfully-acted', 'performances', 'was', 'very', 'evident', 'two', 'stars', 'hurled', 'fiber', 'beings', 'roles', 'chemistry', 'had', 'yearning', 'wistfulness', 'colored', 'word', 'gesture', 'made', 'star-crossed', 'plight', 'much', 'more', 'romantic', 'course', 'demonstration', 'how', 'doomed', 'love', 'really', 'was', 'Catherine', 'was', 'done', 'away', 'third', 'season', 'when', 'stopped', 'watching', 'offense', 'newcomer', 'Hamilton-replacement', 'Jo', 'Anderson', '.I', ""'d"", 'be', 'remissed', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'props', 'writing', 'writers', 'consistently', 'came', 'up', 'episodes', 'were', 'literate', 'magical', 'involving', 'lushness', 'underground', 'world', 'denizens', 'was', 'painted', 'greatly', 'abetted', 'rich', 'shadow-laden', 'tone', 'show', 'tunneled', 'environment', 'almost', 'became', 'yet', 'supporting', 'character', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'seemed', 'breathe', 'same', 'air', 'I.', 'Vincent', 'Catherine', 'Father', 'two', 'decades', ""'re"", 'still', 'brain.In', 'hindsight', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'was', 'burned', 'briefly', 'incandescently', 'now', 'enthralling', 'complete', 'first', 'season', '6-disc', 'dvd', 'set', 'so', 'may', 'again', 'experience', 'show', 'heart', 'literacy', 'integrity', 'enchantment', 'So', 'thanks', 'Paramount']",N/A

A 21 year old TV show ranking along side huge sellers like ""LOST"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", and ""24"". With numbers like those I think we will no doubt see the release of season two VERY soon!Also, I must address a few ""complaints"" that were noted in a previous review (probably one of the only negative reviews you'll ever see regarding this DVD set).Beauty and the Beast has been released in an UN-ALTERED ""full-frame"" format. That's the way it was filmed! Altering the original aspect ratio of ANY film or TV series would cause picture data to be lost (cropped). The first season of ""kung fu"" was released in widescreen format (cropped from its original full frame) and fans are still angry. Thank goodness this was released UN-ALTERED!A few brief notes regarding ""widescreen"" format; Stanley Kubrick, one of the most critically acclaimed film directors in the history of cinema PREFERED to film in the 4:3 (""full frame"") format. That's why many of his films are not available in widescreen, they were never shot that way.ANY aspect ratio is only as good as the director who is using it and how he/she decides to fill it. Also, keep in mind that when the widescreen format was originally adopted for films in the 1950's, it was not chosen because it was ""BETTER"" than full frame. It was primarily a ""gimmick"" to attract movie-goers back to theaters after TV had become VERY popular. In fact, it's still being used as a gimmick today, only now it's being used to attract consumers to widescreen televisions.Regarding the DVD packaging; Yes, it's a basic DVD case (the size of one standard DVD). One disk is located on the inside cover, 4 disks are held on two very sturdy inner ""flaps"", and one final disk is located on the inside back cover. This is NOT a poorly made case! I truly think this is the future of DVD packaging and I prefer this ""standard"" box format because it fits perfectly among all of my other titles! Complaints about the packaging are totally unwarranted!The picture quality is not perfect, but it certainly beats any old VHS copies you might have laying around! I'm completely satisfied with the quality of the picture!!!What can I say about the series itself other than ""classic""? I think the excellent Amazon sales ranking and the huge assortment of positive reviews says it all!Would DVD extras have been nice? Yes, but perhaps they'll surprise us when they release season two! Until then, ""buy with confidence""!

1031329,A366LSLBYNV581,B000K7UBX4,"john J. Hammersley Jr. ""video/dvd watcher""","[3, 4]","The Complete First Season of Beauty and the Beast has arrived on DVD from Paramount Video.  This 1987 fantasy/action/romance/drama series has been one of the most anticipated TV on DVD releases for many fans.  The story takes place in current day (1980's) New York City, where attorney Catherine Chandler (Linda Hamilton) lives a life that has become shallow and meaningless; but her life is about to change.  On a dark and dreary night Catherine leaves her New York High Rise Office, only to be kidnapped, beaten, and left for dead in Central Park (oddly enough they did not seem to want anything from her?).  Suddenly, Catherine is rescued by a mysterious stranger and taken below New York City to a hidden, elaborate, tunnel system below the City.Under the City, Catherine is nursed back to health by this mysterious savior.  The mysterious man turns out to hold many secrets, having an extremely abnormal, lion-like appearance but a heart of a lion to match.  This beast of a man is named Vincent (Ron Pearlman of Hellboy and Alien Resurrection) and quickly develops an emotional bond to the beautiful woman he rescued.  Vincent's adoptive father worries that Catherine may reveal the secrets of the tunnel that the underworld people have worked so hard to hide; but with a strong promise and deep emotion Catherine is allowed to go back to the surface.  Once back on the surface Catherine turns her life around, and becomes a member of the New York D.A. Office as a trial lawyer and investigator.Throughout the First Season, a deeper connection develops between Catherine and Vincent that is emotional, as well as having an odd sexual tension.  Vincent is often saving Catherine from danger and spending the nights with her on her apartment's terrace.  This action coupled with romantic tension is what gave the series such an epic appeal for audiences, and has not lost its luster.  Season 1 of Beauty and the Beast is wonderful, and will hold the audiences interest until the end.  This reviewer can not wait for Season 2, which is even better than Season 1.The episodes of the 1987-1988 Season 1 include:Once Upon a Time in New YorkTerrible SaviorSiegeNo Way DownMasquesBeast WithinNor Iron Bars a CageSong of OrpheusDark SpiritA Children's StoryAn Impossible SilenceShades of GreyChina MoonThe AlchemistTemptationPromises of SomedayDown to a Sunless SeaFeverEverything Is EverythingTo Reign in HellOzymandiasA Happy LifeBeauty and the Beast- The First Season is a 6 disc 22 Episode set with amazing episodes, but whose features dissatisfy throughout in the areas of picture, sound, and extras.  The 1.33 X 1 picture is presented in an unsettlingly bad Dolby Digital Full Screen that views like an analog VHS.  The picture quality is highly distorted, with the colors also being badly off set having an orange twinge throughout.  In the end, the picture is sadly disappointing for such a great series.  The sound is presented in an inadequate Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono.  The sound is highly compressed; giving it a stuffy quality as if a pillow is resting on the speakers, making it difficult to achieve the full experience.  Beauty and the Beast is a wonderfully written series with great visuals that even remain strong after 20 years.  Disappointingly, this Season One release holds no extras for fans to enjoy.  With Ron Pearlman (Beast/Vincent) and Linda Hamilton (Beauty/Catherine) still doing work in the business, it would not have been hard to gain commentaries and interviews to raise this set to the next level.For fans that have been waiting years for this Season One release, don't hesitate to buy.  For newcomers to the series, this is a great time to jump on into the fantastic world of Beauty and the Beast.  Where the technicals of this DVD set may dishearten many (including this reviewer), the greatness that each episode brings makes up for the less than adequate nature of the picture and sound.",5,The Complete First Season of Beauty and the Beast,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,3921,"['Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'arrived', 'DVD', 'Paramount', 'Video', '1987', 'fantasy/action/romance/drama', 'series', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'TV', 'DVD', 'releases', 'many', 'fans', 'story', 'place', 'current', 'day', '1980', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'attorney', 'Catherine', 'Chandler', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'life', 'become', 'shallow', 'meaningless', 'life', 'change', 'dark', 'dreary', 'night', 'Catherine', 'New', 'York', 'High', 'Rise', 'Office', 'only', 'be', 'kidnapped', 'beaten', 'left', 'dead', 'Central', 'Park', 'oddly', 'enough', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'want', 'anything', 'Suddenly', 'Catherine', 'rescued', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'taken', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'hidden', 'elaborate', 'tunnel', 'system', 'City.Under', 'City', 'Catherine', 'nursed', 'back', 'health', 'mysterious', 'savior', 'mysterious', 'man', 'out', 'hold', 'many', 'secrets', 'having', 'extremely', 'abnormal', 'lion-like', 'appearance', 'heart', 'lion', 'match', 'beast', 'man', 'named', 'Vincent', 'Ron', 'Pearlman', 'Hellboy', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', 'quickly', 'emotional', 'bond', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'rescued', 'Vincent', 'adoptive', 'father', 'worries', 'Catherine', 'may', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'tunnel', 'underworld', 'people', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'hide', 'strong', 'promise', 'deep', 'emotion', 'Catherine', 'allowed', 'go', 'back', 'surface', 'Once', 'back', 'surface', 'Catherine', 'life', 'member', 'New', 'York', 'D.A', 'Office', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'First', 'Season', 'deeper', 'connection', 'Catherine', 'Vincent', 'emotional', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'odd', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Vincent', 'often', 'saving', 'Catherine', 'danger', 'spending', 'nights', 'apartment', 'terrace', 'action', 'coupled', 'romantic', 'tension', 'what', 'gave', 'series', 'epic', 'appeal', 'audiences', 'not', 'lost', 'luster', 'Season', '1', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'wonderful', 'will', 'hold', 'audiences', 'interest', 'end', 'reviewer', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'Season', '2', 'even', 'better', 'Season', '1.The', 'episodes', '1987-1988', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Once', 'Time', 'New', 'YorkTerrible', 'SaviorSiegeNo', 'Way', 'DownMasquesBeast', 'WithinNor', 'Iron', 'Bars', 'CageSong', 'OrpheusDark', 'SpiritA', 'Children', 'StoryAn', 'Impossible', 'SilenceShades', 'GreyChina', 'MoonThe', 'AlchemistTemptationPromises', 'SomedayDown', 'Sunless', 'SeaFeverEverything', 'EverythingTo', 'Reign', 'HellOzymandiasA', 'Happy', 'LifeBeauty', 'Beast-', 'First', 'Season', '6', 'disc', '22', 'Episode', 'set', 'amazing', 'episodes', 'features', 'dissatisfy', 'areas', 'picture', 'sound', 'extras', '1.33', 'X', '1', 'picture', 'presented', 'unsettlingly', 'bad', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Full', 'Screen', 'analog', 'VHS', 'picture', 'quality', 'highly', 'distorted', 'colors', 'also', 'being', 'badly', 'set', 'having', 'orange', 'twinge', 'end', 'picture', 'sadly', 'disappointing', 'such', 'great', 'series', 'sound', 'presented', 'inadequate', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'Mono', 'sound', 'highly', 'compressed', 'giving', 'stuffy', 'quality', 'pillow', 'resting', 'speakers', 'making', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'full', 'experience', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'series', 'great', 'visuals', 'even', 'remain', 'strong', '20', 'years', 'Disappointingly', 'Season', 'One', 'release', 'extras', 'fans', 'enjoy', 'Ron', 'Pearlman', 'Beast/Vincent', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Beauty/Catherine', 'still', 'doing', 'work', 'business', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'gain', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'raise', 'set', 'next', 'level.For', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'years', 'Season', 'One', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'buy', 'newcomers', 'series', 'great', 'time', 'jump', 'fantastic', 'world', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Where', 'technicals', 'DVD', 'set', 'may', 'dishearten', 'many', 'including', 'reviewer', 'greatness', 'episode', 'up', 'less', 'adequate', 'nature', 'picture', 'sound']",N/A

From its premiere (which I only saw because I was waiting to watch the season premiere of Dallas), I have been a devoted fan. Enchanting in every way, BATB embraced the essence of romance with its quality acting, writing, music and the depth of each character, especially its starring roles of Vincent and Catherine. There will just never be another tv romantic hero like Vincent. He was intelligent, warm, caring, strong, educated, kind to children but fiercely protective of his Catherine and those whom he considered family. The plots in the first two seasons possessed good story lines, but my favorite episodes were those that highlighted the impossible relationship of Vincent and Catherine. Its timelessness is so well demonstrated by its 20th anniversary and the good production of the DVD set. And now, 20 years later, it is thrilling for me to share BATB with my children who are fascinated by the story of the underground tunnels and those who live in secret places and of course, the love story of Vincent and Catherine, set to gorgeous music and wonderful poetry.

The unconvential couple (Linda Hamilton as assistant DA Catherine Chandler, and the awesome Ron Perlman as the lionesque Vincent) moves from an impenetrable castle to the upscale New York life and the secret, underground tunnels below, where Vincent and his ""family"" make their home.As the story goes, this contemporary beauty and the intelligent beast fall in love but can't be together (and they really can't, what with Vincent looking the way he does). This setup is masterfully done without being over the top. They don't keep it a secret that they truly love and care for each other or complain that ""our love is not meant to be."" They pretty much tell that thought to go to heck and stay there.I adore Catherine-- she's clever, alluring, and can defend herself if put in tough situations (she's a really hands on assistant DA.) She has some pretty funky fashion sense, but all is forgiven when it comes to her cracking cases and putting the bad guys away. Her friendship and deep love for Vincent is refreshing. Linda Hamilton does a stellar job in portraying Catherine. She's a very fine actress- (long live Sarah Connor!)And Vincent... where do I begin? All I can say is I love him! He's sensitive, bright, protective, naive yet cultured, and he's not against killing anyone who would harm Catherine or his family. When you don't condone someone who does that, you know he's a winner. His innocent yet strong love for Catherine is bittersweet and totally compelling. Ron Perlman has this wonderful ability to bring a favorite character to life--Vincent's a breath of fresh air in a stuffy world of tortured, brooding, whining heroes. More heroes should be like Vincent.Okay, so some of the quality from the film is in need of series clean up and the part about Vincent being able to sense when Catherine is in trouble is kind of cheesy, but I am totally buying the power of their relationship and the cases which make them stronger.I don't give five stars out to anything very often, but I will gladly do so with this series.",5,My favorite love story becomes a lovely series,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,2315,"['was', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'show', 'came', 'out', 'actually', 'remember', 'commercials', 'got', 'around', 'renting', 'Netflix', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'time', 'favorite', 'sappy', 'romantic', 'show', 'feel', 'magic', 'air', 'unconvential', 'couple', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'assistant', 'DA', 'Catherine', 'Chandler', 'awesome', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'lionesque', 'Vincent', 'impenetrable', 'castle', 'upscale', 'New', 'York', 'life', 'secret', 'underground', 'tunnels', 'where', 'Vincent', 'family', 'make', 'home.As', 'story', 'contemporary', 'beauty', 'intelligent', 'beast', 'fall', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'together', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'what', 'Vincent', 'looking', 'way', 'setup', 'masterfully', 'done', 'being', 'top', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'secret', 'truly', 'love', 'care', 'other', 'complain', 'love', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'tell', 'thought', 'go', 'heck', 'stay', 'there.I', 'adore', 'Catherine', 'clever', 'alluring', 'can', 'defend', 'put', 'tough', 'situations', 'really', 'assistant', 'DA', 'pretty', 'funky', 'fashion', 'sense', 'forgiven', 'when', 'cracking', 'cases', 'putting', 'bad', 'guys', 'away', 'friendship', 'deep', 'love', 'Vincent', 'refreshing', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'stellar', 'job', 'portraying', 'Catherine', 'very', 'fine', 'actress-', 'long', 'live', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'Vincent', 'where', 'do', 'begin', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'sensitive', 'bright', 'protective', 'naive', 'yet', 'cultured', 'not', 'killing', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'harm', 'Catherine', 'family', 'When', 'do', ""n't"", 'condone', 'someone', 'who', 'know', 'winner', 'innocent', 'yet', 'strong', 'love', 'Catherine', 'bittersweet', 'totally', 'compelling', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'wonderful', 'ability', 'bring', 'favorite', 'character', 'life', 'Vincent', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'stuffy', 'world', 'tortured', 'brooding', 'whining', 'heroes', 'More', 'heroes', 'should', 'be', 'Vincent.Okay', 'quality', 'film', 'need', 'series', 'clean', 'up', 'part', 'Vincent', 'being', 'able', 'sense', 'when', 'Catherine', 'trouble', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'am', 'totally', 'buying', 'power', 'relationship', 'cases', 'make', 'stronger.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'anything', 'very', 'often', 'will', 'gladly', 'do', 'so', 'series']",N/A

Despite his beastly appearance it's easy to fall in love with the gentle, sensative, cultured, physically strong and emotionally vulnerable creature who is both lover and protector to Catherine, a beautiful, privledged, district attorney.

I am a huge fan of Beauty and the Beast. I actually bought all 3 seasons from some other web-site which were obviously copied from TV and copied to DVD. The quality was ""okay"", but they included Vincent's letters. Sometimes you could see commericals on these DVD's, but I was nevertheless grateful to have them.This new DVD release I am grateful for because this is an official DVD from Paramount and CBS. But a couple of things to be aware of: The quality of the DVD is just TV analog quality. It is as if you are watching the original 1987 TV show analog - it is not digitally remastered. Secondly, those of you who know and remember, Vincent writes love letters at the end of each show (the first few shows).  The letters are not included, which is extremely sad they were not included because they were quite beautiful. Lastly, the DVD itself appears to be the simple ""scribewrite"" technology on the DVD. I had hoped it was colorful and it had a bit more dressing on the DVD itself.Regardless, we (the fans) have a very good DVD copy of our favorite characters, Vincent and Catherine. It is still worth the money and worth having for the true fan. We have waited 20 years and I for one am not going to do much complaining.

1031356,ALD1CRUBY1365,B000K7UBX4,R. L. MILLER,"[4, 5]","I really didn't expect to see this series released on DVD. It was a staple of my TV viewing back during the late 1980s, but I hadn't really thought about it until a scene from the episode ""Shades Of Grey"" from this season did a replay in my mind, where the character Mouse, an idiot-savant teenage tunnel dweller, is being reprimanded by Vincent for stealing from Above. Defending himself, Mouse is very exasperated at this; ""TAKE. The word is TAKE. You need something, you take it."" It reminded me of how one of my brothers used to shoplift only a few years before, which he called ""boosting"". Like Mouse, he felt my disapproval of his larceny to be wrong-headed. That same brother also later sneered at me watching this series, saying that it was ""too goody-goody"". Which meant not decadent or tawdry enough. So even back then, cynicism was aready taking a foothold in society.Vincent's community, unlike the Dickens model of petty thievery as the ""local industry"", is based on good, on kindness--everything the world on the surface is not. If someone brought a premise like this before TV networks today, they'd never get it on the air. Maybe a feature film or two, because movies can be aimed at target audiences. But not on TV. Which is why I'm surprised you can get it now on DVD.The premise is a straight-ahead good-versus-evil struggle like the one found in ""Lord Of the Rings"". Only this ""Middle Earth"" is under the streets of Manhattan, involving humans. The hero and heroine are a lion-faced man (Ron Perlman) and a beautiful attorney (Linda Hamilton) he meets by rescuing her from a brutal attack by thugs. Vincent goes on to form an empathic bond with Catherine, and any time she's in trouble, he knows it and comes to her rescue (sometimes on the roof of a subway train).There were times that I didn't always take it as seriously as the ""true fan"" would, like making wisecracks at certain points in the story along the lines of; ""If Vincent finds out, he'll say RAHRRRGHHH!"", the way Vincent roared at the bad guy as he arrived on the scene of some attack. Or something like that. I even envisioned Linda Hamilton releasing a remake of an old Eagles classic; ""You cain't hide....Yore lion eyes"". Oddly enough, I'm still not sure Ron Perlman did those roars himself or if they were dubbed in. But it's still good to hearken back to a time when--as the Urban League used to say in their motto--people treated people as people. Not like on the Yahoo discussion boards where somebody either ""rules"", is ""hot"" or is a ""looser"" (as designated by people who can't even spell the word).

I think the number of five-star reviews here have more to do with memories than anything else--after all, I used to watch ""Happy Days"" regularly when I was a kid, but when I watch it now, I see that it was a pretty awful show.  Well, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a bit better than ""Happy Days,"" but it's still a television show that was produced with weak scripts and an eye towards advertisers.The first thing that I find incredibly bothersome is the fact that after her kidnapping, Catherine is left with no scars on her face at all.  As soon as I saw this, I knew that I was in for further disappointments--after all, it just proved that the producers were interested in a poster-perfect lead, not in a realistic situation.  And the disappointments came.  Each plot is simply Catherine getting in trouble and needing Vincent to show up to rescue her.  There's very little interaction between the two of them, which is what I hoped to watch.  The side characters are all stock characters--there's really no one interesting or different in these scripts.While I applaud the creators for seeming to try something different, all they've really done is create a strange character in a strange world, but throw him into plots that are simply lame.  This is a weak television show that hasn't stood the test of time, and which if aired today would be cancelled after one or two episodes for all the holes in the plots (which include very obvious holes in basement walls which no one but Vincent seems to notice).

1031358,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000K7UBX4,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[1, 1]","This was one of the first ""grownup"" TV shows I remember taking an interest in back when it came out (I was seven). At the time, I was entranced by the visuals, but the more adult elements (romance, intimacy, and urban problems of poverty and discrimination) were lost on me. However, as soon as I heard that Beauty and the Beast had been released to DVD, I rushed out to buy a copy, and the stories and lush visuals don't disappoint.In the TV series, the role of Beauty is Catherine Chandler (Linda Hamilton), a corporate lawyer who is nearly killed in a case of mistaken identity. Brutally beaten and disfigured in a razor attack, she is discovered by the reclusive Vincent (Ron Perlman), part man, part beast who lives in the tunnels below New York City. Vincent and his adopted father (Roy Dotrice) nurse Catherine back to health. Once she returns to the World Above, as Vincent calls it, she is a changed woman and decides to work for the District Attorney's Office in order to help other survivors of violent crimes.  Catherine and Vincent share a strong platonic bond, and although there is definite romantic chemistry between them, they are unable to act on it. Vincent reads Catherine wonderfully romantic, evocative classic love poems; these are also available on theBeauty & the BeastCD.First and foremost, the show is carried by Ron Perlman, who makes the lion/man Vincent a deeply sensitive, poetic, and yes, romantic figure aware of his limitations in Catherine's world. Linda Hamilton as Catherine Chandler is beautiful both inside and out;  deeply concerned for the welfare of others, she has chosen her job from altruism, not for money (her father is rich). Catherine becomes familiar with Vincent's world, where those who are different have found a safe haven under Vincent's wing, so to speak, including Mouse (David Greenlee) and Pascal (Armin Shimerman from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine).  Another notable name is Tony Jay as Paracelcus, a villain who threatens Vincent's world below.The 22 first-season episodes range from mediocre (""Masques,"" with some of the worst Irish accents heard on screen), to captivating (""Fever,"" ""An Impossible Silence,"" ""Nor Iron Bars a Cage""). Given, the show's '80s values (especially production values) do date it quite a bit, but the interplay between characters (and the romantic tension between Catherine and her boss Joe) and Vincent's lush, mysterious world of damp tunnels tempered by candlelight carry the viewer's interest.The film's transfer is grainy and blurry, with scratches particularly noticeable on the pilot. The overall video transfer is inconsistent, and that's a shame. Audio quality is decent. The lack of extras is deplorable, particularly given the show's fierce cult following. The packaging is both space-saving and well thought out, although it's hard to read the synopses when the discs are on top of them. Overall, fans of the series will want to snap this up.

She said my father sent her to tell me that there was a new show on, with people who dressed up old-fashioned, lived in tunnels underground and read books and played chess.  I went into the family room and it was not long before the three of us were completely hooked to this series.  A lovely twist of the famous fairytale, this takes place in New York City, both above and below. Catherine's world is that of high society, business and ambition. It is a world she dutifully participates in, but her heart is not there.  Vincent's world is below, in a network of tunnels, hidden deep under the city, hardly luxurious, yet full of life and intellect.  Books, music, chess, faithful friends, a huge community of dedicate and caring people who were found to be outcasts, one way or another, in the world above, united below.  When Vincent and Catherine meet, a special bond and love grows rapidly and so the story goes along.  Sadly this series came to an early end when Linda Hamilton decided to leave TV and film after the birth of her first child (only to go on and do some very successful films) and Vincent's possible new love interest never really took.  One of the most unique, heartwarming, thoughtful and heartbreaking series you will ever come across-behold!  It is coming on DVD!!  I feel like my biggest dream has been granted!  No series has ever affected my life in the same way this one has.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in fairytales, literature, romance (yes, prepare tissues for many of the episodes)and series that actually teach you to live a better life in a beautiful and gentle way.
