588644,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JKMN,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[38, 46]","In classic, Animal House style, this movie about a squad of bizarre state highway troopers is sure to entertain.  While it appears to be what some may call ""frat boy"" humor, I find that many different kinds of people with a good sense of humor can enjoy this film.Super Troopers is about a group of Vermont State Troopers, led by Capt. John O'Hagen (Brian Cox) whose department is in danger of shutting down.  The governor (Lynda Carter) doesn't have a big budget to spend on police work, and the more professional local cops, lead by Chief Bruce Grady (Daniel von Bargen), are the more likely candidates to get the money in the upcoming budget overhaul.  And, to the casual observor, it would be the right choice.  The state cops have a tendancy to play games with the people they pull over; one game involves one cop repeating everything his partner says, while another has one of the troopers saying ""meow"" instead of ""now"" in an attempt to drive the pulled-over motorist crazy.  And when dealing with stoned teens, they really have a blast.  While officers Ramathorne (Jay Chandrasekhar), Foster (Paul Soter), Mac (Steve Lemme), and ""Rabbit"" Roto (Erik Stolhanske) do everything in good humor, the force's black sheep, Officer Rodney Farva (Kevin Heffernan) tends to go too far and get himself suspended and give the department a bad name (he jumped a fast food clerk for messing with him).But when a murder on the highway is connected with a drug ring, the Super Troopers find a way to redeem themselves and get back in the governor's good graces- as long as the meddling local cops don't solve the case first.This film is hilarious.  While most of the humor is pretty ""dumb"", there are a few intelligent things here and there, but it is the sheer wackiness of it all that makes it great.  The romance between Foster and local cop Ursula Hanson (Marisa Coughlan) is great, especially the prank call sequence.  Although, for people who aren't into crude humor, this won't be your kind of movie.  There is a lot of drug-based humor, some nudity, and gratuitous use of the f-word.  If you can get past that, I highly reccomend this movie.",5,Cops Rock!,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,2140,"['classic', 'Animal', 'House', 'style', 'movie', 'squad', 'bizarre', 'state', 'highway', 'troopers', 'sure', 'entertain', 'be', 'what', 'may', 'call', 'frat', 'boy', 'humor', 'find', 'many', 'different', 'kinds', 'people', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film.Super', 'Troopers', 'group', 'Vermont', 'State', 'Troopers', 'led', 'Capt', 'John', ""O'Hagen"", 'Brian', 'Cox', 'department', 'danger', 'shutting', 'down', 'governor', 'Lynda', 'Carter', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'budget', 'spend', 'police', 'work', 'more', 'professional', 'local', 'cops', 'lead', 'Chief', 'Bruce', 'Grady', 'Daniel', 'von', 'Bargen', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'candidates', 'get', 'money', 'upcoming', 'budget', 'overhaul', 'casual', 'observor', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'choice', 'state', 'cops', 'have', 'tendancy', 'play', 'games', 'people', 'pull', 'one', 'game', 'one', 'cop', 'repeating', 'everything', 'partner', 'one', 'troopers', 'saying', 'meow', 'instead', 'now', 'attempt', 'drive', 'pulled-over', 'motorist', 'crazy', 'when', 'dealing', 'stoned', 'teens', 'really', 'have', 'blast', 'officers', 'Ramathorne', 'Jay', 'Chandrasekhar', 'Foster', 'Paul', 'Soter', 'Mac', 'Steve', 'Lem', 'Rabbit', 'Roto', 'Erik', 'Stolhanske', 'do', 'everything', 'good', 'humor', 'force', 'black', 'sheep', 'Officer', 'Rodney', 'Farva', 'Kevin', 'Heffernan', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'get', 'suspended', 'give', 'department', 'bad', 'name', 'jumped', 'fast', 'food', 'clerk', 'messing', '.But', 'when', 'murder', 'highway', 'connected', 'drug', 'ring', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'find', 'way', 'redeem', 'get', 'back', 'governor', 'good', 'graces-', 'as', 'long', 'meddling', 'local', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'solve', 'case', 'first.This', 'film', 'hilarious', 'most', 'humor', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'are', 'few', 'intelligent', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'sheer', 'wackiness', 'great', 'romance', 'Foster', 'local', 'cop', 'Ursula', 'Hanson', 'Marisa', 'Coughlan', 'great', 'especially', 'prank', 'call', 'sequence', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'crude', 'humor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'kind', 'movie', 'lot', 'drug-based', 'humor', 'nudity', 'gratuitous', 'use', 'f-word', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'movie']",N/A

I saw this with a group of friends who highly enjoy comedies (ranging from the clean stuff to the purely outrageous and raunchy) as well and only 1 out of 6 liked this heap!It starts to take on a very humorous tone with the punks getting busted by the troopers and then having their minds skewered with while under the influene but the rest of the gags are just...well, irritatingly stupid ! The comical acting was very bad. Also, it is utterly insulting for the Monty Python camp to be compared to this( that was real comedy). After so many years after the Police Academy series you would think cop comedies by today's film making standards would have improved. Super Troopers made Police Academy look like Academy Award material ! The real sad clincher is seeing an actress like Linda Carter (Wonder Woman) make a painful to watch cameo. Don't get me wrong, Linda is still a fine actress and a gorgeous woman ! But when you see someone that has been missing from the spotlight for awhile you begin to wonder if they took the role out of desperation or what.

Second, the gags take way too long to set up, and then usually have paltry payoffs that are tiny in proportion to the laughs delivered.  Third, there are too many characters.

The other day, I rented it when I was standing at the video store and it was one of the only things left. I am so glad that I rented this film. I'll most likely go and buy it sometime next week. And here's why:With a resin-caked genius, the guys in the comedy troupe Broken Lizard have made what is one of the most enjoyable and consistently funny films of recent years. It doesn't suffer from the third act unfunnyness that other comedies suffer when they sacrifice laughs and an established pace in favor of trying to wrap up a plot that wasn't that great in the first place. (A good example of this? How about the sometimes painfully bad ending to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - or any other movie where the plot and/or subplot love interest get in the way of comedy.) Here, although there is a love interest and there is a cohesive plot, one needent worry because these elements don't detract from the film at any point. Instead, the film keeps its spirit and pace going - never stopping to take ANYTHING seriously. There are very few gags here that don't work and if you're a fan of the aforementioned Jay & Silent Bob or Dude Where's My Car - this stoner comedy will most likely work for you. The film opens with a scene lifted out of Cheech and Chong's Up In Smoke - with a nice twist or two - and manages to maintain the energy throughout the film. Also, Brian Cox is brilliant as the head of the delinquent State Trooper post. So for fans of pot humor or films like Caddyshack or the original M*A*S*H* - this is surely a film you will enjoy.

Tax, tags, title extra.Everyone should have that one friend who is overly sarcastic with bone-dry wit.  If you do not, then you may not have an appreciation for this movie.  Broken Lizard has assembled numerous scenes forced into a poor ""boy meets girl"" and ""corrupt law enforcement"" plotline.

Since I was too young to get into the R-rated Club Dread, I rented Super Troopers and laughed my ass off. This is funny, funny stuff, and a much better parody of cops than Reno 911 in my opinion.In Vermont, there's an ongoing feud between the state troopers and local cops. The five local state troopers (the Broken Lizard guys) spend most of their time playing pranks on drivers, or in Farva's (Kevin Heffernan) case, giving radio assistance to Thorny (director Jay Chandrasekhar) and his rookie partner Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske), and the other trooper team, Foster (Paul Soter) and Mac (Steve Lemme). Then a dead woman's body is found in a Winnebago (as is a pig), and drug shipments pop up, seemingly in connection to the murder, not only because there's a Johnny Chimpo cartoon monkey (aka the monkey in the Broken Lizard logo) tattooed on the dead woman and logo on the drugs. The troopers are determined to get credit for this, but first, there's a meeting with a German couple with a VERY open relationship, one of the troopers joining the cops (it rhymes with Larva), Foster falling for a sweet local cop (Marisa Coughlan), and a delivery of a very large cotton candy.This movie really is a wacky good time that's equally clever and crude, gross-out and sophisticated (not unlike Monty Python, wink wink). Most people nowadays know who Farva is and haven't even seen the movie. This is Broken Lizard's best yet (Puddle Cruiser, their first film in 1996, and Club Dread are hilarious, too, though), and Chandrasekhar just directed the not-as-bad-as-the-critics-say Dukes of Hazzard movie, giving all the Lizards cameos (he and Stolhanske even pop up as college cops that act a lot like Thorny & Rabbit).

It's the story of 5 Vermont State Troopers fighting to keep their station open. They then go into a war with the Local Police who seem to try to take credit for everything they do, or sabatage their progress. After a while though things about the local cops start to get suspicious, and it seems something that's not exactly legal may be going on with them. The movie is written by ""Broken Lizard"", a team of 5 writers who play the five state troopers in the movie.The best part of the movie by far is the characters. The 5 state troopers are each unique and different, and are absolutely hilarious.Among them you have Rabbit, the rookie cop who doesn't really know that much about his job yet, Mac the crazy one who will do absolutely anything, Foster the one with a love affair going on with the local cop Ursula, and of course Farva the funniest part of the entire movie. It also seems that the troopers don't take their job seriously, as they like to pull pranks on their unlucky traffic victims, like saying meow ten times to a driver who's been pulled over, no wonder their station is being shut down. However if you buy this movie for only one thing, you have to buy it for Officer Rob Farva. He is perhaps the funniest character I've ever watched. The things he says and does are just outrageously funny, and you could very well picture this guy being a state trooper. If you watch the credits after the movie, you see Farva's famous school bus incident which is talked about in the movie. One of my favorite things that Farva does is when they are at a dinner party, he says to Mac ""hey you wanna go hit for hit?"" and Mac hits him downstairs. All Farva can say ""Oh I did not specify"". Haha. The pranks and other gags are also very funny, and enough to keep you entertained for the hour and a half or so the movie lasts. The underlying story isn't that bad either.If you like comedies, I don't see how you couldn't like Super Troopers. It's definitely one of the funniest I've ever seen. I think the people who don't like it either read into it too or expect something else, and the movie never really gets a fair chance with them. Officer Rod Farva is definitely worth the price of admission though, and this one is much better than""Broken Lizard""'s latest ""Club Dread""",5,Hilarious comedy that never lets up,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,2400,"['Super', 'Troopers', 'one', 'movies', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', ""'re"", 'still', 'going', 'think', 'funny', 'story', '5', 'Vermont', 'State', 'Troopers', 'fighting', 'keep', 'station', 'open', 'then', 'go', 'war', 'Local', 'Police', 'who', 'seem', 'try', 'take', 'credit', 'everything', 'do', 'sabatage', 'progress', 'while', 'things', 'local', 'cops', 'start', 'get', 'suspicious', 'something', 'not', 'exactly', 'legal', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'movie', 'written', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'team', '5', 'writers', 'who', 'play', 'five', 'state', 'troopers', 'movie.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'far', 'characters', '5', 'state', 'troopers', 'are', 'unique', 'different', 'are', 'absolutely', 'hilarious.Among', 'have', 'Rabbit', 'rookie', 'cop', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'job', 'yet', 'Mac', 'crazy', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'Foster', 'one', 'love', 'affair', 'going', 'local', 'cop', 'Ursula', 'course', 'Farva', 'funniest', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'also', 'troopers', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'job', 'seriously', 'like', 'pull', 'pranks', 'unlucky', 'traffic', 'victims', 'saying', 'meow', 'ten', 'driver', 'who', 'been', 'pulled', 'over', 'wonder', 'station', 'being', 'shut', 'down', 'However', 'buy', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'buy', 'Officer', 'Rob', 'Farva', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'character', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'picture', 'guy', 'being', 'state', 'trooper', 'watch', 'credits', 'movie', 'see', 'Farva', 'famous', 'school', 'bus', 'incident', 'talked', 'movie', 'One', 'favorite', 'things', 'Farva', 'when', 'are', 'dinner', 'party', 'Mac', 'hey', 'wan', 'go', 'hit', 'hit', 'Mac', 'downstairs', 'Farva', 'can', 'say', 'Oh', 'did', 'not', 'specify', 'Haha', 'pranks', 'other', 'gags', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'enough', 'keep', 'entertained', 'hour', 'half', 'so', 'movie', 'underlying', 'story', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either.If', 'comedies', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'like', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'definitely', 'one', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'read', 'too', 'expect', 'something', 'else', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'fair', 'chance', 'Officer', 'Rod', 'Farva', 'definitely', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'latest', 'Club', 'Dread']",N/A

How could I, pontifex maximus of the holy imperial priesthood of self-ordained movie critics, ever stoop to watch this movie?My first viewing largely confirmed my original suspicion--it was an inane sophomoric piece, but I didn't feel like I wasted my time. The opening sequence is devastatingly funny, and there are enough clever antics to keep one interested. Yet it is only after repeated viewings that this movie grows on you.Admittedly, this isn't for everyone. I suppose if one enjoyed watching Oprah and found Pretty Woman to be the epitome of filmmaking, then no, that person would not enjoy Super Troopers. If the uniformity and the sterility of suburbia have left your mind fit only for the cute and the maudlin of Hollywood, look elsewhere.On the other hand, there are those who deride this movie as being of inferior quality. Poor plot, etc. I am a die-hard Monty Python fan, but I wouldn't consider the Holy Grail to be ""High Art"" in a strictly cinematic sense. It too is a loosely strung together series of skits, and ""character development"" is seriously lacking. Although not as brilliant as Monty Python, Broken Lizard is nevertheless a clever, entertaining group. This isn't great art, but that wasn't their intent either. Similarly, if one is too wrapped up in the insularity of the self-righteous high-brow, then he should look elsewhere.Is Super Troopers a ""Great"" movie in the cannonical sense? No. But it is a damn entertaining one, especially if you still have the lively, irreverant spirit of youth. Inane and sophomoric? You betcha.

I hope.I was hilariously surprised when I sat down and watched this film (tho, not like I would stand up to watch a film)Super Troopers I guess you could say are a bunch of State Highway cops who are just that bored with no real criminals or much to do that they entertain themselves for there own personal amusement.

Although there is a fair amount of swearing, too much, even by my standards.

Well, let me add to the heresy: I liked Club Dread better than I liked their first, Super Troopers.Now, don't get me wrong, I thought Super Troopers was a riot. It's as funny a piece of ensemble comedy as I've seen in quite a while. But that is its greatest weakness-- where Club Dread comes together as an actual film, Super Troopers feels more like a ninety-minute episode of a sketch comedy show.The story concerns a crime. Well, a series of crimes, really, all tied into one big criminal conspiracy. A squad of state police (the Broken Lizard guys, headed up by Manhunter's Brian Cox) and a squad of local police (a bunch of non-Broken Lizard guys and Teaching Mrs. Tingle beauty Marisa Coughlan, headed up by Lord of Illusions' Daniel von Bargen) are competing with each other, trying to see who can crack the case first. But, of course, nothing can be quite as easy as it seems...Yes, it does have a plot, but it seems like that takes a back seat to the jokes most of the time. Which is not a terrible thing as long as the sense of the plot the viewer retains is strong enough to last through the stretches where the film lapses into sketch mode (as was the case in Club Dread), but here, things tend to wander off, coming back to the plot when the side jokes run out of energy. It's enjoyable, and I know I'm the only person on the planet who will tell you this, but if you're looking for a good movie, rent Club Dread.

It's essentially the highway patrolmen versus the local cops, constantly in an effort to outdo each other due to a pending budget cut - neither wants to get the axe.

588752,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JKMN,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","""Super Troopers"" has a wacky cartoon-like quality that turns what might have been just a typical, lame-brained police comedy into an infectious little romp.  Prime credit goes to a quintet of performers known as ""Broken Lizard,"" a New York and L.A. based comedy team that has appeared on stage together for the past 10 years.  The five play Vermont State troopers who spend most of their time staging elaborate pranks and practical jokes to the befuddlement of all those who come in contact with them.  The nice thing about ""Super Troopers"" is that it keeps the antics more or less life-sized, not allowing them to spill over into elaborate preposterousness.  The officers seem more like shrewd, good-natured kids out having a good time than the mentally deficient whackos we usually find in films of this nature.The comedy troupe consists of Jay Chandrasekhar (who also directed the film), Kevin Heffernan , Steve Lemme, Paul Soter and Erik Stolhanske, all of whom had a hand in the screenplay as well.  These actors obviously feel comfortable working together as an ensemble and the results show up on screen.

588757,AJJ11F5MHN8K9,B00005JKMN,"sfarmer76 ""sfarmer76""","[1, 1]","Super Troopers (2002), is the rare comedy that has managed to sneak into my burgeoning DVD collection -- I generally prefer drama, action, horror, and sci-fi movies. My initial reason for purchasing this disc was because Brian Cox had a small supporting role, and I'm very pleased with his performance here.Usually I'd just launch into the plot, but I'd like to introduce you to these funny characters; Farva (Kevin Heffernan), Foster (Paul Soter), Mac (Steve Lemme), Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske), and Ramathorn (Jay Chandrasekhar) are all bumbling Vermont State Troopers at imminent risk of losing their beloved station house to discretionary budget cuts.Perhaps this group of actors sounds unfamiliar? They're part of the Broken Lizard comedy troupe. They're the same people responsible for that Beerfest movie that came out this past summer. Anyways, these guys did a superb job delivering a sidesplitting movie framed upon dopy arch rivalry between bored city and state cops.Events taking place in this film occur in the fictional Vermont town of Spurbury. The movie begins with a roadside confrontation between Ramathorn, Rabbit, and three joyriding teens stoned on pot. The cops pull a joke on the teens, hoping to scare them. Musical accompaniment from The Unband further enhances the scene.Right after that, there's a moment in M's Cozy Corner Diner when troopers Rabbit and Ramathorn engage in a syrup chugging contest -- and end up starting a melee with four yahoos from the local Spurbury police. This ruckus is halted by Captain O'Hagan (Brian Cox) and Chief Grady (Daniel Von Bargen).The comedy keeps getting edgier. Trooper Farva (suspended from patrol) is the acting police dispatcher, and he relishes hazing his coworkers at the station house meetings with idiotic tomfoolery like putting soap bars in the coffee. Troopers Womack ""Mac"" and Foster also have fun harassing lead-footed Vermont speeders with inane word games.Really unexpected -- I could summarize the gags repeatedly -- but one third of the way through the film, a plot revolving around a murder and a slipshod drug bust develops. Just for good measure, love appears in the mix when jovial Trooper Foster falls for Spurbury's lovely dispatcher Ursula (Marisa Coughlan).One of the funnier scenes takes place at a baseball game when Ramathorn's son Arlo is at bat. Foster visits the concession stand where he runs into Ursula (who's also off duty), and she jokingly remarks that he can slug her since she hit him at the prior melee. While Ursula's eyes are closed tight, Arlo's homer pops her in the face and Foster ends up wearing a sno cone.Of course -- this hapless troop just isn't that smart. Rabbit pulls a stupid stunt and Captain O'Hagan yanks him off patrol. This gives Farva a chance to go on patrol again, but he blows it immediately by assaulting a sarcastic counter clerk at Dimpus Burger.Perhaps the only way these goons can save themselves is if they solve the bungled drug case before Governor Jessman's (Lynda Carter) campaign swings through Spurbury.Eventually the troopers deduce Chief Grady is cooperating with Canadian drug dealers, and affect a last minute collar after a drunken fistfight. Unfortunately it's all for naught, and the precinct is closed. However, all five (minus O'Hagan) end up working for the Spurbury PD.Repeat viewing of Super Troopers will not disappoint. The picture is bright and clean and the soundtrack is endlessly engaging. Besides the score from .38 Special, you'll experience tracks from individuals and bands such as Bubbles, Charles Burbank, Jack Grace Band, Nashville Puss-y, Royal Fingerbowl, Southern Culture on the Skids, and Steak.Super Troopers is a classic comedy -- on par with American Pie, Friday, or Office Space -- and it's hilarious. The screenplay and the capable direction by Jay Chandrasekhar really stand out. The cast apparently had a great time making the film, and their enthusiasm shows up on the screen.

It's a very off-beat and funny little movie that shows us into the lives of a state trooper's department somewhere in Vermont. To protect and serve has no meaning here...it's about making us laugh. The plot is about this department trying to save themselves from being shut down due to budget constraints. They desperately need to prove that they are still needed so they don't lose their jobs. So they write lots of speeding tickets, but a drug bust could be their ticket to job salvation. However when you go along for the ride with these troopers, you're in for much more than car chases (yes, you get those too). You get stoned college kids (and I won't ruin it by detailing more...awesome), the repeater, meows, speeding Porsches, syrup chugging, and a ton of wacky little pranks along the way. I could go on all day about Super Troopers but I feel it's a total disservice to someone who has never seen it. I absolutely love this movie and recommend it to anyone who needs a little more silliness in their lives, who loves to laugh and who wants a different comedy than the mainstream things you typically see mass produced by Hollywood where they practically beg of you to find things funny.

The story follows the efforts of five Vermont highway patrol officers and their captain.  Because of certain budget cuts, the station may be shut down forcing them to transfer to another station.  The officers know they have to do something big or else they could all lose their jobs.  Their opportunity arises when a murder and a drug trafficking ring is linked together.  All the while, the highway patrol is battling nearby local police for control of the area.  This is a very funny movie with an excellent ensemble cast.  The best part of the movie is the routines the guys have that they use to mess with people when they pull them over on the road.  Some of the other routines are just as funny like the bulletproof cup and Rabbit's diversion late in the movie.Super Troopers has an excellent ensemble cast that works great together.  Brian Cox plays the veteran captain trying to keep his men together and is very good especially the last half hour.  The five officers are played by Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Eric Stolhanske as Thorny, Foster, Mac, Rabbit, and Favra.  The DVD offers theatrical trailers, widescreen format, extended scenes, deleted scenes with commentary, outtakes, an alternate ending, and a featurette.

588776,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00005JKMN,wellwellwell,"[14, 18]","I think it's safe to say that anyone who saw this movie saw it because of its trailer.  No one had probably heard of the comic group &quot;Broken Lizard&quot;, I'm sure of that.  But then that's the point of the trailer.  The five-man police team of Broken Lizard stars Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske; along with their ill-fated chief Brian Cox.  The group, who's on the verge of having their station shut down, does pretty much whatever they please out on the road.  I mean, they are cops.  Maybe not good cops, but still cops.  They do things ranging from highway games such as &quot;repeater&quot; to seeing who can say &quot;meow&quot; the most.  And I can honestly say the first 10 minutes or so of 'Super Troopers' is the best first 10 minutes of any movie I've ever seen.And even after the beginning, the comedy and laughs continue on throughout the movie.  And in fact, the point that their station is going to be shut down doesn't even phase them.  They just keep on making jokes until we (the viewer) can't handle it.  The movie was said to have no plot, and that's very true.  But a good plot isn't even needed.  The acting is so awesome, you'll seemingly have a new respect for your local boys in blue.  Okay, maybe not.  I do have to say that Kevin Heffernan's role of the dense and almost stupid Farva is the best.  He is basically the odd man out, as the other four officers are good friends.  The lines that Farva has are so dumb that you can't help but laugh out loud.Besides Heffernan's infamous Farva, there's Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar), Mac (Steve Lemme), Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske), and Foster (Paul Soter).  All five characters bring their own blend of comedy to the force, which is why they work so well together.  The comedy they use almost seems to be like small skits; and they even manage to give Jim Gaffigan, who has done stand-up comedy on Comedy Central, a small but hilarious role as one of their many quote-unquote: victims.I don't like to give away movie endings, even if the ending is not what makes the movie.  So that's where I'll stop.  If you like comedy films you'll certainly enjoy 'Super Troopers'.  It is one of my favorite movies, no doubt.  I gave it 5 stars, even though it didn't have a truly good plot.  And it derserves 5 stars; which if you see this movie, you'll understand.  Like I said, the five-man crew may or may not give you a new respect for the force; and if not you'll still laugh for the entire movie.  If you saw the trailer and even thought about seeing the movie, do see it.
