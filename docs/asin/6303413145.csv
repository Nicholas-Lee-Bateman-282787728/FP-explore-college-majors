373261,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6303413145,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 6/03, 11/03, 2/05, 8/05, 7/07, 8/11Rate: 107/07: Hoop Dreams is probably the best movie of any to recapture the structure and the machinery of a Greek tragedy. There is Michael Jordan who poses as Zeus, the ominous god, where virtually all kids are inspired to reach the heights as he did. Then there is Isiah Thomas who acts like Apollo, singing the sweet music, because simply that he was a local product that eventually reached his stars. Introduce Arthur Agee and William Gates whom I meet them both and get know to them intimately for five years witnessing their growth during highs and lows. When I think of Hoop Dreams, it's not just a basketball movie. Rather it is a movie of two kids who boldly chase the American dream. Oddly, they don't focus on this single-handedly and obsessively, but they have other issues: family, school, personal problems, and living the good life. It's incredible how the males are always constantly falling apart, and yet the mothers are those who stayed strong throughout the trying times. It's not so much that the naivety in Arthur Agee that bothers me, but how people like Gene Pingatore exist in this world. Yes, I know Gene Pingatores and Luther Bedfords; it's the latter that I have better memories while I have bitter memories of the former. Finally there is the ""net"" result, as described by Earl Smith (the black scout), and I get to see the aftermath of Curtis Gates (who sadly died fairly recently). Also, another slain member of the families is Arthur Agee's father. I recently searched if there would be a Hoop Dreams reunion in the works, and Arthur Agee, in his own website, had made one himself and wanted to have it shown. But there hadn't been any takers in Hollywood. Honestly, I would have loved to see the reunion so to update and tell what had happened to everybody after all those years since the days of Hoop Dreams. I hope it happens some day. Why do I think that Hoop Dreams is one of the most brilliant pictures made? Well, I think that's an easy question to answer. My reaction is: go and see it. Another documentary that can be placed in the same shoulders with Hoop Dreams is Harlan County USA. Both are extremely similar in many ways, but Hoop Dreams is a very shattering urban saga. The most famous scene...well, there are bunch of them in Hoop Dreams that are just as famous as well...will have to go to the one-on-one game with Arthur Agee and his father at near the end of the picture. That was a game of purgatory and catharsis as Arthur vents out his anger towards his father through he knew best: basketball. Another two scenes that are endearingly memorable are the Mother's Day card with Sheila Agee and when Sheila gets groomed prior to her ceremony for graduates of nursing school. When I think look at Hoop Dreams critically, I don't think it would have worked out to a certain extent as it already widely acclaimed today hadn't if Arthur's team made a stunning run to third place finish in the state basketball tournament. That was the biggest highlight of the movie as far as success went. Gene Pingatore was dead wrong when he described William Gates' career as being good, but not great, one. Gee whiz...William was selected as All-State and All-American that senior year. Not every basketball player has a chance to be nominated so greatly as William Gates. He even got a full scholarship to Marquette University...a Division I school. A full ride! I was able to get the scores of that state tournament where Marshall finished 3rd. Moreover, the team that beat Marshall in the semifinal didn't win the tournament [...]. Batavia was actually 27-1 before bowing out to Marshall, and Arthur had 45 points in 4 games while Howard Nathan had 91 points. Arthur didn't make the All-Tournament team. As found in Wikipedia, ""(Howard) Nathan is now paralyzed after an allegedly drunk driver drove into his Oldsmobile in Peoria on July 30, 2006."" The past year, Luther Bedford had passed away. I never got the information to find out what had happened to Shannon, Arthur's friend. Still, Hoop Dreams remains a must-see picture for anyone.8/11: Hoop Dreams is still one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, and I've always revisit it from time to time. It's that compelling to watch. Of course, googling Arthur Agee and William Gates' names will invariably bring a lot of updates. It's interesting to see how much of changes have come in their lives. Obviously, their dreams have long died, but it's always nice to be that age and be young and naive; it's something that is sorely missed in many youth. Yeah, that was a good film. In a way, I feel that if not for Arthur's team making a huge run for third place finish in state tournament, Hoop Dreams may not have been the film it came out to be. Here is an interesting trivia of the film as taken from IMDB: ""Unfortunately, both players suffered much tragedy after the documentary. In 1994, William Agee's older half-brother, DeAntonio, was gunned down at Cabrini-Green. In 2001, William Gates' brother, Curtis, was killed in a carjacking in 2001. In 2004, Arthur's father, ""Bo"" Agee, was shot to death in an alley. At the 15th anniversary at the Gene Siskel Film Center (Nov. 4, 2009), Agee told the audience that ten of his friends from the film were no longer alive."" All in all, Hoop Dreams is one of the greatest masterpieces in cinema.",5,"Engrossing, Shattering Urban Saga.",1315958400,"09 14, 2011",2011,5381,"['Viewed', '6/03', '11/03', '2/05', '8/05', '7/07',

The story also  takes high dramatic tones that we forget it's a documentary. Smoothly  flowing over it's whoopping 3 hour running time, it's surprisingly never  boring and always holds your attention.

It doesn't seem like these boys, and countless others like them, get  a fair shot in life. They are kind and sweet, but it's like they have  strikes against them from the very start. I was saddened at the school  system, which gets rid of Arthur because they basically have no use for  him, and the living conditions-one of the boys, in his own neighborhood-  was held up at gunpoint, and to see him there trying not to cry as he  explained the incident, it made me feel like he deserved so much better  than that. Both of them did.  And you feel equally for their families, I  cried when the mom got her nursing assistant license, she worked so hard.  They were both good boys, Arthur does not get into drugs,  he works at a  Pizza Hut for 3 dollars an hour. They wanted so much to realize their dream  of the NBA, and it made me so sad to wonder what happened to all those boys  who didn't make it. Isn't there someone who can help these boys who aren't  fortunate enough to get the chances that everyone deserves?  And isn't  there still a reward and a payoof if they don't make it?

373264,A32EDSKLEUZ3Y7,6303413145,Chris,"[2, 3]","I turned on ESPN and saw this and I soon got entranced by it.It follows the stories of two High School Basketball prodigies.Being a fan of all the prospects I knew I must watch this movie. The two kids William Graves and Arthur Agee were both guards from the Inner City Chicago and they were both many of the basketball prodigees. I turned in to see there Freshman years William was one of St. Josephs school and was a starter something that even Isiah Thomas was not at the same school.The other guy was Agee who was the starter for the Freshman team. He ran into his problems with the school and by the time they both entered there sophomore year Agee was having trouble with the School and had to transfer to a Inner City School.Graves was called the ""Next Isiah"" by many folks in Illinois.in 1985 his brother Corey was compared to Michael Jordan but his career did not pan out. By there Junior year William had a serious knee injury and Arthur had school and team troubles. He worked hard to help his team out. By this time William had a daughter Alicia. By the time of the start of there Senior season William was invited to the prestigious ABCD Basketball camp presented by Nike. This tournament is the very best High School players by there year. His year just happened to be the class of 1991 a class that had the Fab 5 in it and also had the likes of Glenn Robinson and others. 1991 was a great year. William was injured again over the summer and was blasted by the coach of his school. Artur Agee had to get his life in line. Arthur was being scouted by many schools but chose Marquette. Arthur chose a Junior College in Missouri. There senior years were different the top team St.Josephs had a succesful but disapointing season and Arthur's school won city championships including a win over the number one team in the Nation. They would loose in the state quarters.After High School they both graduated college and Arthur played in the ABLand William had a brief stint with the Wizzards in 2001.",5,Great Documentary,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,2007,"['turned', 'ESPN', 'saw', 'soon', 'got', 'entranced', 'it.It', 'stories', 'two', 'High', 'School', 'Basketball', 'prodigies.Being', 'fan', 'prospects', 'knew', 'must', 'watch', 'movie', 'two', 'kids', 'William', 'Graves', 'Arthur', 'Agee', 'were', 'guards', 'Inner', 'City', 'Chicago', 'were', 'many', 'basketball', 'turned', 'see', 'there', 'Freshman', 'years', 'William', 'was', 'one', 'St.', 'Josephs', 'school', 'was', 'starter', 'something', 'even', 'Isiah', 'Thomas', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'school.The', 'other', 'guy', 'was', 'Agee', 'who', 'was', 'starter', 'Freshman', 'team', 'ran', 'problems', 'school', 'time', 'entered', 'sophomore', 'year', 'Agee', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'School', 'had', 'transfer', 'Inner', 'City', 'School.Graves', 'was', 'called', 'Next', 'Isiah', 'many', 'folks', 'Illinois.in', '1985', 'brother', 'Corey', 'was', 'compared', 'Michael', 'Jordan', 'career', 'did', 'not', 'pan', 'out', 'Junior', 'year', 'William', 'had', 'serious', 'knee', 'injury', 'Arthur', 'had', 'school', 'team', 'troubles', 'worked', 'hard', 'help', 'team', 'out', 'time', 'William', 'had', 'daughter', 'Alicia', 'time', 'start', 'there', 'Senior', 'season', 'William', 'was', 'invited', 'prestigious', 'ABCD', 'Basketball', 'camp', 'presented', 'Nike', 'tournament', 'very', 'best', 'High', 'School', 'players', 'year', 'year', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'class', '1991', 'class', 'had', 'Fab', '5', 'also', 'had', 'likes', 'Glenn', 'Robinson', 'others', '1991', 'was', 'great', 'year', 'William', 'was', 'injured', 'again', 'summer', 'was', 'blasted', 'coach', 'school', 'Artur', 'Agee', 'had', 'get', 'life', 'line', 'Arthur', 'was', 'being', 'scouted', 'many', 'schools', 'chose', 'Marquette', 'Arthur', 'chose', 'Junior', 'College', 'Missouri', 'senior', 'years', 'were', 'different', 'top', 'team', 'St.Josephs', 'had', 'succesful', 'disapointing', 'season', 'Arthur', 'school', 'won', 'city', 'championships', 'including', 'win', 'number', 'one', 'team', 'Nation', 'would', 'loose', 'state', 'quarters.After', 'High', 'School', 'graduated', 'college', 'Arthur', 'played', 'ABLand', 'William', 'had', 'brief', 'stint', 'Wizzards', '2001']",N/A

The producers and directors followed two teens in the inner city of Chicago who knew each other and who had the same dream.  To make it to the NBA.  Neither young man did, but watching them grow and the ups and downs of their families is eye opening.  Both boys were selected to go to St Francis as fourteen year old children and both were not equipped academically to do well in that rigorous environment.  A mostly white environment.  Arthur Agee could not stay in the school even one year, as his family could not afford the high tuition.  Also, initially, he was not as gifted a player as William Gates, who was more precocious.  The school went out of its way to keep Gates eligible while basically sending Agee back to the public school system without even a cursory attempt to allow him to stay at St Francis.  The school also got Gates jobs and money to assist him with expenses and travel to and from the school. The same did not occur for Agee.  All over the country, young men and women attempt to set themselves apart on the athletic fields at a young age.  Mostly not academically.Agee went on to become a star in the public school he attended and went to a junior college before going on to college.  Due to injury, Gates did not reach his full potential in high school but did get a scholarship to Marquette U. where he played for four years but was never a star or perhaps even a starter.  During the course of the four year period examined, Gates and his girlfriend had a child.The subjects of this film are charismatic and articulate but in addition, you see how the lives of the families are turned around due to homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse, unemployment and other aspects of the inner city of Chicago and many other cities of the U. S.  One other point that should be made is the effect of standardized testing on children as they go through school and the fact that many of these tests are biased and keep bright young people from ever attending college.In addition, you see how Gates is the chosen one who gets the tutoring and the high class medical attention while Agee, as the less talented, is the person who has to make his own way. Agee's dream does not flicker but at the end of the film, Gates is so unhappy with the game that he is about to quit the college team at Marquette but he does stay on the team in his senior year.

373267,ACJVGDN8G386P,6303413145,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[1, 1]","The original project was intended as a 30-minute short film about two young African-American athletes playing in a yard which was supposed to air on PBS. Several years later, the film became a 3-hour feature documentary film, telling a much larger story than even about the two young athletes. Somewhat similar to Ken Burns' ""Baseball"", ""Hoop Dreams"" is an expos&eacute; of life in Urban America somewhat removed from much of the fair coming out of Hollywood. The ordeals experienced by these real people, both young and older, make plots of ""Beverly Hills 90210"" seem mundane by comparison. And none of the participants are actors. Aside from the challenge of basketball itself, these people deal with marginal housing and transporting, food and money shortages, and even an unexpected teenage pregnancy. Also, Gates suffers a knee injury in the middle of the season.Although the outer subject is primarily about William Gates and Arthur Agee and their rise as outstanding basketball players in high school and early college, the film also has a context and subtext about American society. This film exposes the many racial divides which still exist in our society in terms of economic and social opportunities. One message which speaks loud and clear is that many of these youngsters who live on Chicago's South Side believe their only route to a better life may be through a basketball hoop, hence the name of the film. I don't think this is something the filmmakers necessarily intended, but it's a reality that becomes very apparent as the film progresses.Both Gates and Agee are highly accomplished athletes yet they struggle with their academics. Gates has an opportunity to enter Marquette University in Wisconsin, and the sports program there decides to court the young player, offering him a full scholarship to the university. They are already sold on his playing ability, but Gates' one hurdle is acquiring a minimum score on the ACT test which Marquette requires for admission. A councilor discussing the problem with Gates who has not yet scored high enough mentions that if he worked on the test as fervently as he works on free throw shots, he could pass the exam. Agee also struggles with his own academics as well, and then something hit me.Gates and Agee are highly intelligent individuals, and this intelligence exudes itself in spades on the basketball court. Neither could have accomplished their athletic goals without a high level of acumen. But this intelligence is not channeled as successfully into other areas of their lives. Whether we mean to or not, our culture often fragments different kinds of activities. Sports, and sometimes the arts, are not often seen as activities requiring high intelligence, and yet being successful in sports requires as much brain power as writing computer code. And you also have to have a well-trained body. Gates' and Agee's surroundings I believe inadvertently conditioned them to believe that the skills they bring to basketball are not the same as the ones in academic studies. And yet, they never question their ability to improve on the court but have problems believing in their abilities in the classroom, which may be one of the points of Hoop Dreams.Ultimately, the filmmakers chose two extraordinarily gifted people. When I say gifted, I don't just mean their abilities as athletes. These two channeled their gifts into playing basketball but given other circumstances they might have been able to channel them into almost anything. The hope is that these individuals, now adults when I write this, would be able to channel their gifts into any field they choose, and it looks like they have. Only a few hundred people out of a society of 300 million will be able to play professional basketball. Gates and Agee have followed dreams outside of basketball and maybe their participation in this film helped them to do that. At the same time, basketball did help them to realize they could realize their dreams, hoops or otherwise.",5,"Two Young Athletes, a Basketball, a Court and a Camera Tell the Inside Story of Chicago Basketball Culture",1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,4002,"['original', 'project', 'was', 'intended', '30-minute', 'short', 'film', 'two', 'young', 'African-American', 'athletes', 'playing', 'yard', 'was', 'supposed', 'air', 'PBS', 'Several', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'became', '3-hour', 'feature', 'documentary', 'film', 'telling', 'much', 'larger', 'story', 'even', 'two', 'young', 'athletes', 'Somewhat', 'similar', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Baseball', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'expos', 'eacute', 'life', 'Urban', 'America', 'somewhat', 'removed', 'much', 'fair', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'ordeals', 'experienced', 'real', 'people', 'young', 'older', 'make', 'plots', 'Beverly', '90210', 'seem', 'mundane', 'comparison', 'none', 'participants', 'are', 'actors', 'Aside', 'challenge', 'basketball', 'people', 'deal', 'marginal', 'housing', 'transporting', 'food', 'money', 'shortages', 'even', 'unexpected', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', 'Also', 'suffers', 'knee', 'injury', 'middle', 'season.Although', 'outer', 'subject', 'primarily', 'William', 'Gates', 'Arthur', 'Agee', 'rise', 'outstanding', 'basketball', 'players', 'high', 'school', 'early', 'college', 'film', 'also', 'context', 'subtext', 'American', 'society', 'film', 'many', 'racial', 'divides', 'still', 'exist', 'society', 'terms', 'economic', 'social', 'opportunities', 'One', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'many', 'youngsters', 'who', 'live', 'Chicago', 'South', 'Side', 'believe', 'only', 'route', 'better', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'basketball', 'hoop', 'hence', 'name', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'something', 'filmmakers', 'necessarily', 'intended', 'reality', 'very', 'apparent', 'film', 'progresses.Both', 'Gates', 'Agee', 'are', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'athletes', 'yet', 'struggle', 'academics', 'Gates', 'opportunity', 'enter', 'Marquette', 'University', 'Wisconsin', 'sports', 'program', 'there', 'court', 'young', 'player', 'offering', 'full', 'scholarship', 'university', 'are', 'already', 'sold', 'playing', 'ability', 'Gates', 'one', 'hurdle', 'acquiring', 'minimum', 'score', 'ACT', 'test', 'Marquette', 'admission', 'councilor', 'discussing', 'problem', 'Gates', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'scored', 'high', 'enough', 'mentions', 'worked', 'test', 'as', 'fervently', 'free', 'throw', 'shots', 'could', 'pass', 'exam', 'Agee', 'also', 'own', 'academics', 'well', 'then', 'something', 'hit', 'me.Gates', 'Agee', 'are', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'individuals', 'intelligence', 'spades', 'basketball', 'court', 'could', 'have', 'accomplished', 'athletic', 'goals', 'high', 'level', 'acumen', 'intelligence', 'not', 'channeled', 'successfully', 'other', 'areas', 'lives', 'mean', 'not', 'culture', 'often', 'different', 'kinds', 'activities', 'Sports', 'sometimes', 'arts', 'are', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'activities', 'requiring', 'high', 'intelligence', 'yet', 'being', 'successful', 'sports', 'much', 'brain', 'power', 'writing', 'computer', 'code', 'also', 'have', 'have', 'well-trained', 'body', 'Gates', 'Agee', 'surroundings', 'believe', 'inadvertently', 'conditioned', 'believe', 'skills', 'bring', 'basketball', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'ones', 'academic', 'studies', 'yet', 'never', 'question', 'ability', 'improve', 'court', 'have', 'problems', 'believing', 'abilities', 'classroom', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'points', 'Hoop', 'Dreams.Ultimately', 'filmmakers', 'chose', 'two', 'extraordinarily', 'gifted', 'people', 'When', 'say', 'gifted', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'abilities', 'athletes', 'two', 'channeled', 'gifts', 'playing', 'basketball', 'given', 'other', 'circumstances', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'channel', 'almost', 'anything', 'hope', 'individuals', 'now', 'when', 'write', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'channel', 'gifts', 'field', 'choose', 'have', 'Only', 'few', 'hundred', 'people', 'society', '300', 'million', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'professional', 'basketball', 'Gates', 'Agee', 'have', 'followed', 'dreams', 'basketball', 'maybe', 'participation', 'film', 'helped', 'do', 'same', 'time', 'basketball', 'did', 'help', 'realize', 'could', 'realize', 'dreams', 'hoops', 'otherwise']",N/A

Hoop Dreams is a documentary that follows two Chicago inner-city boys from their freshman year in high school to their freshman year in college as they try to make it into the NBA. The film not only focuses on the pursuit of their dreams but how it affects their families.For a documentary that is almost three hours it doesn't take long to get sucked into the absorbing story of these two boys. We watch them grow up both physically and emotionally, struggling to realize their dreams and this makes for truly compelling drama. This is a fascinating look at two boys and their families: their triumphs and their failures with an unflinching eye. Hoop Dreams cuts through the gloss and sheen of the NBA propaganda to show the harsh realities of what it truly takes to make it and how easy it is to fall short.There is an audio commentary by filmmakers Peter Gilbert, Frederick Mark and Steve James. This is a good, inside look on the filmmaking process, how it came together and the challenges they faced over the five years of filming.There is also an audio commentary by Arthur Agee and William Gates.

This film follows the lives of two extraordinarily gifted basketball players, Arthur Agee Jr. and William Gates.  Both young men are from the Cabrini Green Housing Projects of Washington DC, one of the roughest, toughest neighborhoods on the East Coast.  On a daily basis, Arthur and William must face and deal with major curveballs that life throws their way, all the while keeping their heads up in the pursuit of their hoop dreams.  The film starts with them, as fourteen year old boys, and ends with them as they start their college careers.What makes this film so beautiful, and why it stands out for me, is due to the fact that you don't have to be a baskbetball fan (or even a sports fan) to find William and Arthur's stories compelling.  These young men must overcome incredible odds just to keep their focus on basketball strong.  While Arthur's father (Arthur Sr.) is in and out of jail, due to drug related incidents, William's mother (who refers to William as her ""Little Man"") must raise her children, as a single mother, on welfare, all the while aspiring to get a certification in nursing.  We really feel that we come to know these marvelous young men over the course of the film.  It was a privilige, for me, that the director made this experience so intimate, for us, the viewers.  What's more, the dreams of Arthur and William are bright spots in a truly bleak existence that they must face on a daily basis.

For one, it is an almost five year documentary on the lives of two young Chicago basketball players, Arthur Agee and William Gates, and the worlds they live in - on and off the basketball court. I came to find myself rooting them on, not necessarily on the court (although I did that too), but I desperately wanted them to succeed off the court. The obstacles are there for both of them.For William, it's two surgeries that jeopardize his prospects as the ""next Isaiah Thomas."" For Arthur, his greatest difficulty is trusting his newly released con-man father. In fact, both boys find themselves trying to trust their distant fathers. William's dad shows up after the colleges start calling and talk of NBA stardom begins to drift in across the Windy City.As we watch Hoop Dreams, we see the boys begin to see life as it is and not as what they imagined it would be. They half-heartedly welcome the praise of coaches who would otherwise treat them like vagabonds if not for their talent. We see them battle the temptations of the streets and the nightmare of domestic abuse. When they speak to the camera in their quiet moments, we feel the rage and despair that ring through their voices. No script could ever duplicate such honesty of the human condition.Hoop Dreams is three hours long but it is worth every moment.

373278,A1LV84XC0C1Q5R,6303413145,John E. Davidson,"[3, 3]","'Hoop Dreams' is one of the best documentaries ever made, in fact it may be one of the best films ever made.It follows the stories of two young African American men (William Gates and Arthur Agee) and their families as they attempt to realise their dreams and escape the ghetto through basketball. The documentary follows the boys through four years of High School and on to college.It is a moving, sometimes heartbreaking film that allows you to accompany the boys on their journey and on the way provides great insight into the wider issues. In many ways Hoop Dreams is a classical documentary - the filmmakers shot hours footage and then edited it down to the three hour film. There is very little editorial, they simply show us the edited highlights of what they recorded and allow the viewers to draw their own conclusions. This approach allows the filmmakers (and us) to examine not just high-school basketball but also the wider racial and social issues.I am not sure that it is possible to spoil the plot of a documentary but if you want it to be a surprise, read no further....The story beings with St Joseph's - an up market high school - recruiting both boys on partial scholarships. William is an instant success - even from the brief clips it is obvious he has an amazing talent for basketball - he makes the school first team as a freshman (very uncommon) and looks to have a professional career in front of him. Arthur is a different story. He has talent but he seems to lack the maturity to utilise it and he is kicked out of school at the end of his freshman year for unpaid school fees. William, the potential star, has been found a personal sponsor who pays the rest of his tuition ensuring that he can stay in school, there is a strong implication that if Arthur had been a better player sponsorship would have been found for him as well. The school emerges with no great credit over their treatment of Arthur as over the next few years they ruthlessly pursue his family for the money, withholding his school records to make life very difficult for him at his new school. Sadly things turn sour for William as well, he gets injured and then re-injured playing when he should not. Although his physical injuries heal he is never the same player again.Even from the start, the extent to which their families are pinning all their hopes on the two boys is terrifying and heartbreaking (we know the odds are stacked against them). They both live in a very poor and dangerous neighbourhood - with the other members of their family working at minimum wage jobs to try to keep the family afloat - basketball is their only way out, their only chance to live the American dream. William has an older brother, Curtis, who had the talent but not the temperament to make it as a basketball player; he now lives vicariously through William, simply adding to the pressure. Arthur's dad has problems with drugs and domestic violence that tear his family apart.There can be few more tragic scenes ever filmed than the segment showing Arthur shooting hoops at the local playground while his Dad scores drugs in the background. Equally unforgettable is the scene where Arthur, just before he leaves for college, plays basketball with his Dad and the years of repressed anger explode. In many ways the most memorable moment from the whole film is the line uttered by William at the end; it seems to sum up the predicament of these boys. ""People say, 'When you make it to the NBA, don't forget about me.' I feel like telling them, 'Well, if I don't make it, make sure you don't forget about me.' ""This is a fabulous film - watch it you can find it - you will not be disappointed.

373281,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6303413145,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 2]","After each time Hoop Dreams has been shown to me, I have gotten a little closer to the story, as the story provided an opportunity to ponder the notion of dreams and hopes.  The first time I saw this amazing film was in the winter of 1995 at the Gothenburg Film Festival in Sweden.  At that time I learned more about the cultural differences between being a poor teen in Chicago compared to being a teen in Sweden.  The second time I viewed the film was in 1997, as I attended a university here in the United States.  This time the film had a more profound affect on me, as I could relate to the emotional journey that sports have on a person, as I also was heavily involved in college athletics.  Now more than a decade later since the first viewing of Hoop Dreams I have moved to Chicago where I am also a part of the educational system in the city of Chicago.  This time I can not only relate, but recognize the many obstacles that these two teens went through during the filming of this absolutely brilliant film.The opening shot of the film shows the West Loop area and the downtown loop area of Chicago with the Sears Tower in the background, as the Blue Line L train moves toward the underground part of the L system and the Eisenhower Expressway.  Today, the West Loop area is an up and coming area with newly built condos and ever increasing property tax, as is much of the area around the immediate downtown area.  However, ten years ago much of  this area had high poverty rates where many kids dreamed of playing themselves away from poverty through basketball.  In Hoop Dreams the audience gets to follow two teens William Gates and Arthur Agee through five years of struggle where they try to achieve the dream of getting away from the poverty and violence in their neighborhood.William and Arthur were scouted for private schools located in the suburban area of Chicago, a very different world compared to the Cabrini Green Housing Project where they grew up, as both of them were excepted to St. Joseph High School.  Through the first year the audience learns that William starts on varsity team as a freshman and many compares his talent with former St. Joe's player and former NBA star Isiah Thomas.  For Arthur things are not going so well, but he makes the freshman team where he has some success.  When the freshman year comes to an end both William and Arthur face some financial difficulty.  William gets help from some of St. Joe's booster club members while Arthur who does not have the same talent as William finds himself being forced to leave St. Joe's, as he cannot pay for the tuition increase.Basketball is everything to William and Arthur, but the story also offers an intricate view of the socioeconomic environment and how this affects psychodynamics of their families and neighborhood.  It offers several opportunities for the viewers to experience how Arthur's family is cooping with the difficulties of losing their jobs, separation between the parents, and Arthur beginning in a new school.  It is a tough journey that Arthur must go through, but he has no choice as poverty keeps him from returning to St. Joe's.  Besides Arthur's difficulties William faces other hurdles, such as an injured knee and having a child.  This story goes into great lengths on illustrating how this injury affects his whole persona and how he is involved with his newborn baby.Hoop Dreams brings a vision of what these two young men, Arthur and William, desire, but it also shows the struggle they had to encounter due to lack of opportunities as middle school and elementary school students.  These missed opportunities originate in poverty, which consequently leads to a number of missed functions in life such as structure, parental guidance, and safety.  This was not because the mother's in the film did not care, because they did.  However, there was a consistently missing male role model for both teens.  Thus, Arthur and William had to tread a much longer path in order to achieve the same goal, as they must quickly learn how to become young adults without proper guidance.  It is a hard and long journey that they both had to venture, and as a viewer of Hoop Dreams I am ever so grateful for having the opportunity to watch both Arthur and William together with their families go through ups and downs in  life, which offers a greater appreciation of life.",5,Hopes and Desires in Brilliant Documentary...,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,4385,"['time', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'been', 'shown', 'have', 'gotten', 'little', 'closer', 'story', 'story', 'provided', 'opportunity', 'ponder', 'notion', 'dreams', 'hopes', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'amazing', 'film', 'was', 'winter', '1995', 'Gothenburg', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Sweden', 'time', 'learned', 'more', 'cultural', 'differences', 'being', 'poor', 'teen', 'Chicago', 'compared', 'being', 'teen', 'Sweden', 'second', 'time', 'viewed', 'film', 'was', '1997', 'attended', 'university', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'profound', 'affect', 'could', 'relate', 'emotional', 'journey', 'sports', 'have', 'person', 'also', 'was', 'heavily', 'involved', 'college', 'athletics', 'Now', 'more', 'decade', 'later', 'first', 'viewing', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'have', 'moved', 'Chicago', 'where', 'am', 'also', 'part', 'educational', 'system', 'city', 'Chicago', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'relate', 'recognize', 'many', 'obstacles', 'two', 'teens', 'went', 'filming', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'film.The', 'opening', 'shot', 'film', 'West', 'Loop', 'area', 'downtown', 'loop', 'area', 'Chicago', 'Sears', 'Tower', 'background', 'Blue', 'Line', 'L', 'train', 'moves', 'underground', 'part', 'L', 'system', 'Eisenhower', 'Expressway', 'Today', 'West', 'Loop', 'area', 'up', 'coming', 'area', 'newly', 'built', 'condos', 'ever', 'increasing', 'property', 'tax', 'much', 'area', 'immediate', 'downtown', 'area', 'However', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'much', 'area', 'had', 'high', 'poverty', 'rates', 'where', 'many', 'kids', 'dreamed', 'playing', 'away', 'poverty', 'basketball', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'audience', 'follow', 'two', 'teens', 'William', 'Gates', 'Arthur', 'Agee', 'five', 'years', 'struggle', 'where', 'try', 'achieve', 'dream', 'getting', 'away', 'poverty', 'violence', 'neighborhood.William', 'Arthur', 'were', 'scouted', 'private', 'schools', 'located', 'suburban', 'area', 'Chicago', 'very', 'different', 'world', 'compared', 'Cabrini', 'Green', 'Housing', 'Project', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'were', 'excepted', 'St.', 'Joseph', 'High', 'School', 'first', 'year', 'audience', 'William', 'varsity', 'team', 'freshman', 'many', 'compares', 'talent', 'former', 'St.', 'Joe', 'player', 'former', 'NBA', 'star', 'Isiah', 'Thomas', 'Arthur', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'freshman', 'team', 'where', 'success', 'When', 'freshman', 'year', 'end', 'William', 'Arthur', 'face', 'financial', 'difficulty', 'William', 'help', 'St.', 'Joe', 'booster', 'club', 'members', 'Arthur', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'talent', 'William', 'being', 'forced', 'leave', 'St.', 'Joe', 'can', 'not', 'pay', 'tuition', 'increase.Basketball', 'everything', 'William', 'Arthur', 'story', 'also', 'intricate', 'view', 'socioeconomic', 'environment', 'how', 'psychodynamics', 'families', 'neighborhood', 'several', 'opportunities', 'viewers', 'experience', 'how', 'Arthur', 'family', 'cooping', 'difficulties', 'losing', 'jobs', 'separation', 'parents', 'Arthur', 'beginning', 'new', 'school', 'tough', 'journey', 'Arthur', 'must', 'go', 'choice', 'poverty', 'returning', 'St.', 'Joe', 'Arthur', 'difficulties', 'William', 'other', 'hurdles', 'such', 'injured', 'knee', 'having', 'child', 'story', 'great', 'lengths', 'illustrating', 'how', 'injury', 'whole', 'persona', 'how', 'involved', 'newborn', 'baby.Hoop', 'Dreams', 'vision', 'what', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Arthur', 'William', 'desire', 'also', 'struggle', 'had', 'encounter', 'due', 'lack', 'opportunities', 'middle', 'school', 'elementary', 'school', 'students', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'originate', 'poverty', 'consequently', 'number', 'missed', 'functions', 'life', 'such', 'structure', 'parental', 'guidance', 'safety', 'was', 'not', 'mother', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'did', 'However', 'was', 'consistently', 'missing', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'teens', 'Thus', 'Arthur', 'William', 'had', 'tread', 'much', 'longer', 'path', 'order', 'achieve', 'same', 'goal', 'must', 'quickly', 'learn', 'how', 'become', 'young', 'adults', 'proper', 'guidance', 'hard', 'long', 'journey', 'had', 'venture', 'viewer', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'am', 'ever', 'so', 'grateful', 'having', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'Arthur', 'William', 'together', 'families', 'go', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'life']",N/A
373282,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6303413145,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","I thought that ""Hoop Dreams"" would be about a couple of inner city kids in Chicago dreaming about being the next Michael Jordan in the N.B.A.  But actually the role model is Isaiah Thomas for the simple fact that he was a graduate of St. Joseph's High School, where William Gates and Arthur Agee are recruited to play basketball.  Neither William or Arthur are going to be the next Air Jordan, but if they can measure up to what Isaiah did in high school that can translate into a college scholarship.  If there is anything that dates this 1994 documentary it might be that the boys are not dreaming of jumping immediately to the N.B.A. after high school.  Getting to college is still a necessary evil for getting to the pros, and there is the more immediate goal of ""going downstate"" to play in the Illinois High School State Basketball Tournament at Assembly Hall on the campus of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (or Champaign-Urbana if you live outside of Illinois).When we first meet William and Arthur they are in the eighth grade, and come by different paths to make the 90-minute commute to St. Joseph's to play basketball.  Gates lives in the Cabrini Green project while Agee's family lives on the South Side of Chicago, and the film is as much about what it is like for young Africa-Americans to grow up in those neighborhoods as it is about the dream of playing professional basketball.  But the belief that playing hoops is a way out of the inner city is so carved in stone for these kids that it never seems to occur to them that their might be another way out.  This is underscore by one of the best moments in the film where we suddenly learn that a family member of one of the boys has been going to school and is graduating at the top of their class.  Then we get back to the boys playing basketball.Steve James, Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert shot 250 hours worth of film over six years to tell these two stories and they probably could not have scripted anything better than what Fate gave them.  By the end of their freshman year at St. Joseph's one of the boys has to drop out because his parents cannot pay their part of the tuition and apparently he is not playing well enough for the school to come up with a sponsor.  Before their junior year the other boy has a serious knee injury that threatens everything he and has family have dreamt about.  Meanwhile at their homes the parents are becoming unemployed or suddenly leave while the children are already having children.  Then there are the college recruiters and the qualifying tournaments for state.At 165-minutes long ""Hoop Dreams"" is a lot closer to being too short than too long, although certainly it could benefit from some different editing choices in a few places.  Maybe my perspective is skewed because I have become use to reality series on television that are obviously a whole lot longer (but usually not as engaging).  The more you know about the place of basketball in the inner city and at perennial powerhouse programs like St. Joseph's the less you will find watching this documentary to be an eye-opening experience.  Most of us know that most coaches care about winning more than they do about the players and that this is a system out to exploit kids who are begging to be exploited because there is a chance that one day they will strike it rich and buy their moms a house.For the most part the drama is off the court, although towards the end of the documentary this changes because since we are watching real life we cannot take for granted such things as making critical free throws or winning the big game like we can in movies like ""Hoosiers.""  The fact that we know that today neither William Gates nor Arthur Agee are N.B.A. superstars does not detract from this engrossing documentary, because the moral of the story is discovered by one of the boys who has finally come to realize the flip side of the dream.  Pointing out that people are always telling him not to forget them when they get to the N.B.A., he wonders if they will not forget him if he does not make it to the pros.  The final great irony is that because of ""Hoop Dreams"" he will not be forgotten but that there are not any million dollar salaries or shoe contracts with this particular brand of fame.This Criterion Collection DVD offers two audio commentary tracks, the first with Arthur Agee and William Gates and the second with filmmakers Peter Gilbert, Steve James and Frederick Marx.  There is also a series of segments from ""Siskel and Ebert"" in which the two Chicago film critics push ""Hoop Dreams"" as their choice for top film of the year and attack the Documentary division of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for ignoring the film, and a music video for the film.  You will also find a booklet with essays by cultural historian John Edgar Wideman and ""Sports Illustrated"" senior writer Alexander Wolff, along with Michael Wise's ""Looking Back at Broken Dreams"" article that ran in the ""Washington Post.""",5,The Criterion Collection edition of the powerful documentary,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,5018,"['thought', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'would', 'be', 'couple',

373283,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6303413145,Linda Linguvic,"[26, 27]","This 1994 award-winning documentary is about William and Arthur, two Chicago African-American teenagers who, in the eighth grade, are recruited to play basketball for a middle-class parochial high school.  Both are good at basketball but struggle with their academics. And both dream of playing for the NBA.The film follows these two boys for a full six years.  It also follows their families and we get a glimpse of the challenges of everyday life in the ghetto.  These are real people, not actors, and they have to cope with a lot, including Arthur's father drug problem and the economics of living on $268 per month on welfare.  Wisely, the camera is never feels intrusive, and I felt I was right there with them, watching them grow, both mentally and physically.  There's a lot of struggle, with highs and lows in their personal lives as well as on the basketball courts, and it is always fascinating.  The film is almost three hours long but it is so intriguing that I could have watched it for another hour.This might not be fiction, but the individual stories are filled with drama as it deals with some very sensitive issues of class, race, maturity and hard choices.  And the director, Steve James, who wrote the film along with Fredrick Marx, managed to edit it so perfectly, that I was totally unaware of anything else but just being a part of this world for the duration of the film.

Not only is it the best documentary of all time but one of the greatest movies of all time.I was amazed at how director Steve James was able to get this on film so perfectly.  The story follows two inner city kids, Arthur Agee and William Gates, and their dream of making it to the NBA and out of the ghetto.  The doc was filmed over five years we watch these two boys at fourteen grow to be young men and the ups and downs they go through.  Viewers also get a look into the life of how kids are scouted and the harsh realities that go along with it but ultimately it's an uplifting story about overcoming your struggles and preserving.The doc is so natural that at many points I forgot it was a documentary and I was watching a movie based on a true story.  Basketball was a part of my life growing up, playing on courts all around Mass, that and a love for film I was certain I'd like Hoop Dreams.  Also reading over the years the high praise it received at times once you finally see a movie it could be a let down because your expectations were so high.  What I found was the film exceeded any expectations I had and was so much more then just being about basketball.You don't watch a movie like Hoop Dreams you experience it.

The movie starts out with with arthur being showcased.  He is like in 7th grade and can really play with the older kids, and you might believe this now, but I didn't believe it 11 years ago, a recruiter shows up and wants arthur to go to a certain high school.  Throughout the movie there is HUGE things going on like arthur's dad buying drugs ON CAMERA right after shooting a couple of hoops.  The movie keeps pouring things like this on like where it's a GOOD thing the camera crew is at arthur's house because they had their electricity shut-off and the camera and candles are their only source of light.If I went over all the powerful moments of this movie or even the best ones then I would honestly never stop writing.  So since I rarely go over special features of a movie, I will go over this one since the commentary is almost better than the movie.  Now I don't buy movies for special features, but if you love this movie and would buy it without special features, then you are in the greatest treat in dvd history.I know that some of you have probably said to yourself ""I wish they would make a hoop dreams part 2 to see where these guys are doing now.  I mean the director spent SO much time following these kids around and then we only got like 2 1/2 hours of this footage, they should definitely do a follow-up.""  Well if you said that then you are in for a big freaking surprise.PART 2 IS HERE.  10 years later they are doing a commentary.  If you are watching this on 2-channel stereo than you have william in one speaker and arthur in the other.  AWESOME.  I would really like to comment on this but I feel like I would be ruining hoop dreams part 2.  There is also a commentary by the director which I haven't listened to all the way, but because it's a documentary, the director has a hell of a lot more to comment on than a movie like gladiator like when the electricity is shut off.Now of course after reading all the other reviews I am pleased that they are providing pretty much all of the information, but one thing I did not see mentioned was that this was not even NOMINATED for best documentary.Now there are many things that could be brought up here of why these mother f****s didn't nominate this and I will fight against all of them:movie is too long--this is incorrect because the movie is obviously too short, they had to have had 100's of hours that didn't make it into the movie so the fact that they cut this movie by about 261 hours, I say that it definitely isn't too long.Movie is about sports--who the hell cares, I've seen horrible documentaries about non-sport related topics.Now the last point I can't really backfire against, now I may not be seeing this as clearly as a black person being that I am white, but I detect some serious racism with the people who pick the nominees for the oscar's.  it is very sad that I have to say that, but if anyone knows the truth on why this movie was not nominated then please tell me, because I say you are full of stuff until you lay down some facts.So like I said this is easily the best dvd that has ever come out, and it also has a sort of tribute to siskel and ebert to thank them for giving good pub about this movie.  I just wished that they could have helped out because somebody behind the curtains was pulling the strings for the oscars that year.",5,"One of the best movies ever, and easily the BEST DVD YOU WILL EVER OWN",1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,3578,"['CRITERION', 'COLLECTION', 'DOES', 'IT', 'AGAIN.This', 'movie', 'william', 'gates', 'young', 'arthur', 'agee.If', 'have', 'ever', 'played', 'basketball', 'mean', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'play', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'freaking', 'blow', 'mind', 'movie', 'out', 'arthur', 'being', 'showcased', '7th', 'grade', 'can', 'really', 'play', 'older', 'kids', 'might', 'believe', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', '11', 'years', 'ago', 'recruiter', 'up', 'arthur', 'go', 'certain', 'high', 'school', 'movie', 'HUGE', 'things', 'going', 'arthur', 'dad', 'buying', 'drugs', 'ON', 'CAMERA', 'right', 'shooting', 'couple', 'hoops', 'movie', 'pouring', 'things', 'where', 'GOOD', 'thing', 'camera', 'crew', 'arthur', 'house', 'had', 'electricity', 'shut-off', 'camera', 'candles', 'are', 'only', 'source', 'light.If', 'went', 'powerful', 'moments', 'movie', 'even', 'best', 'ones', 'then', 'would', 'honestly', 'never', 'stop', 'writing', 'rarely', 'go', 'special', 'features', 'movie', 'will', 'go', 'one', 'commentary', 'almost', 'better', 'movie', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movies', 'special', 'features', 'love', 'movie', 'would', 'buy', 'special', 'features', 'then', 'are', 'greatest', 'treat', 'dvd', 'history.I', 'know', 'have', 'probably', 'said', 'yourself', 'wish', 'would', 'make', 'hoop', 'part', '2', 'see', 'where', 'guys', 'are', 'doing', 'now', 'mean', 'director', 'spent', 'SO', 'much', 'time', 'following', 'kids', 'then', 'only', 'got', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'footage', 'should', 'definitely', 'do', 'follow-up', 'Well', 'said', 'then', 'are', 'big', 'freaking', 'surprise.PART', '2', 'IS', 'HERE', '10', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'doing', 'commentary', 'are', 'watching', '2-channel', 'stereo', 'have', 'william', 'one', 'speaker', 'arthur', 'other', 'AWESOME', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'comment', 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'ruining', 'hoop', 'dreams', 'part', '2', 'also', 'commentary', 'director', 'have', ""n't"", 'listened', 'way', 'documentary', 'director', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'comment', 'movie', 'gladiator', 'when', 'electricity', 'shut', 'off.Now', 'course', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'am', 'pleased', 'are', 'providing', 'pretty', 'much', 'information', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'mentioned', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'NOMINATED', 'best', 'documentary.Now', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'here', 'why', 'mother', 'f****s', 'did', ""n't"", 'nominate', 'will', 'fight', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'incorrect', 'movie', 'obviously', 'too', 'short', 'had', 'have', 'had', '100', 'hours', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'fact', 'cut', 'movie', '261', 'hours', 'say', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'too', 'long.Movie', 'sports', 'who', 'hell', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'horrible', 'documentaries', 'non-sport', 'related', 'topics.Now', 'last', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'backfire', 'now', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'seeing', 'as', 'clearly', 'black', 'person', 'being', 'am', 'white', 'detect', 'serious', 'racism', 'people', 'who', 'pick', 'nominees', 'oscar', 'very', 'sad', 'have', 'say', 'anyone', 'truth', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'then', 'please', 'tell', 'say', 'are', 'full', 'stuff', 'lay', 'down', 'facts.So', 'said', 'easily', 'best', 'dvd', 'ever', 'come', 'out', 'also', 'sort', 'tribute', 'siskel', 'ebert', 'thank', 'giving', 'good', 'pub', 'movie', 'just', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'out', 'somebody', 'curtains', 'was', 'pulling', 'strings', 'oscars', 'year']",N/A

It's yet another work that makes your typical normal middle-class life seem banal in light of the accomplishments and struggles of the underdogs.Basically, it's like watching all of those millions of ""underdog sports"" movies, except this one has the added tension of being real: these kids can fail at any moment, and sometimes a last-second basket gets missed.

373291,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,6303413145,R.A. McKenzie,"[4, 4]","There are so many wonderful things I have to say about this DVD that this review probably won't make much sense.  So, I guess the best compliment I can give to ""Hoop Dreams"" is that it's so magnificent that I don't know where to begin.I guess the best place to start is to assume that you've no idea what this movie is, and have stumbled onto it by accident.  After all, ""Hoop Dreams"" hasn't taken its rightful place in film history yet.  It was released the same year as ""Forrest Gump"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Speed"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""The Lion King""...sadly, ""Hoop Dreams"" has yet to be as well-known, even though it was more critically-praised than any of those 1994 pictures.So, what is ""Hoop Dreams""?  In simplest terms, it's a 3-hour documentary that focuses on two kids in Chicago, both of them loving nothing more than playing basketball.  The film begins with 8th graders Arthur Agee and Williams Gates being ""recruited"" to St. Joseph High School on the basis of their athletic abilities.  They attend a summer camp.  They meet St. Joseph grad Isiah Thomas, who made it to the NBA.  William and Arthur commute 3 hours to attend the school.  Their families are lower-class African-Americans, each with their share of struggles and reactions to the boys' education and athletics.  By the end of ""Hoop Dreams"", we have joined the filmmakers in following Arthur and William from grade 8 to their freshman year in college.Now, for some reason, documentaries don't sound like they can be interesting or exciting.  I think that's because most of us had to watch very dull and laborious educational programs when we were in school, not to mention that documentaries by their very nature lack a certain amount of control in the story.  But ""Hoop Dreams"" is different, VERY different.  Not only are the people engaging, but in simple filmic terms, this crew managed to get some awesome footage and did an incredible job of cutting 7 years' worth of footage into a 3-hour picture.  The film has a great pace, and in some ways, is more dramatically compelling than most fictional tales.  Yet ""Hoop Dreams"" tells its story through the interviews and camera shots, rather than the filmmakers voice-over narrations.  We do get some narration so that we can understand what's going on, but ""Hoop Dreams"" doesn't have a Michael Moore telling you what to think.  The footage speaks for itself.The stories of William and Arthur have very fascinating aspects to them.  William has an older brother, Curtis, whose basketball career never took off, leaving Curtis to live vicariously through his younger brother.  William has to contend with a knee injury during his junior year, raise a daughter with his girlfriend, and endure a love/hate relationship with St. Joseph coach Gene Pingatore.  The coach's behavior alternates between verbally abusive and down-to-Earth.  He's the kind of man whose methods are like double-or-nothing bets in blackjack; you're either a genius, or a madman.Arthur Agee, on the other hand, ends up in a very different place than William.  Because of his low grades and his family's inability to pay for the education, Arthur spends most of high school career at another school with less money and poorer facilities.  Ironically, Marshall High School (w/ Arthur) fares much better than St. Joseph (w/ William), even though the latter has more resources for its students and extra-curricular activities.  The Agee family supplies both the saddest and happiest moments of ""Hoop Dreams"".  Arthur's father, Bo, struggles to remain a positive influence on his son's life.  The scene when Bo pays a sudden visit to his son, only to buy drugs minutes after shooting hoops is harrowing, made even sadder that the filmmakers just happened to be there.  But Arthur's mother, Sheila, becomes a true heroine, as she remembers to celebrate Arthur's birthdays and works to become a nurse.There are so many more moments in ""Hoop Dreams"" that have imprinted onto my memory that I can't possibly name them all.  But one more thing I want to focus on is the basketball games.  After all, this is a movie called ""Hoop Dreams"".  The footage that is shown is sure to strike a personal chord with anyone who's been to a game.  The odd enthusiasm of a high school game's audience.  The smell of the hardwood floor.  The dimly-lit gyms.  The sad faces of the losing team's players.  It all hits you in the heart, and will spark some nostalgia.  But more importantly, the games themselves are kinda exciting to watch.  When William Gates' knee injury starts to affect his team, you (the viewer) feel sad.  We don't want to see him fail; we want him to sink those dramatic free throws and earn a chance for a scholarship.  Sports movies typically have a formula, but ""Hoop Dreams"" makes the formulas work, and it's not even trying!Why does ""Hoop Dreams"" resonate with me so much?  It's because ""Hoop Dreams"" isn't a basketball movie, and it's not just a documentary either.  This is a movie with something to say, but lets you decide what it is.  This is a movie filled with compelling characters, but none of them are actors.  These are real people!  ""Hoop Dreams"" has great footage and scenes, but none of them were storyboarded or scripted (Listen to the DVD commentaries to learn why they regretted filming a moment when the Agee Family loses power to their home).  Finally, it is so much more than a talking-heads documentary.  You truly feel like you're sitting in the same room as these people, attending the same basketball games, worshipping with the same congregation, listening to the same doctors & coaches, and playing on those same asphalt courts.There are many films that have been praised to be something more than just a movie, but ""Hoop Dreams"" is one of the few to deserve such praise.  It did back in 1994, and it deserves to be remembered among the true achievements in motion pictures.DVD EXTRASThere are very few extras on the DVD, but in true Criterion fashion, they're all splendid.  First, you get to see about 15 minutes of clips from the Siskel & Ebert show.  Say what you will about critics, but Gene Siskel (of the Chicago Tribune) and Roger Ebert (of the Chicago Sun-Times) were very responsible for making this sure that ""Hoop Dreams"" achived the success it did back then.  You get to see the original review, their original pitch to have the film nominated for the Academy Awards, the shocking reveal that ""Hoop Dreams"" was deliberately screwed out of the Oscar votes, and finally seeing Roger Ebert hail it his favorite movie of the 1990s with Martin Scorsese as his guest host.  Come to think of it, ""Hoop Dreams"" is my favorite movie from the 1990s, as well.The last extras are two audio commentaries.  The first is by Steve James, Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert (the filmmakers).  They reveal many interesting facts of ""Hoop Dreams"", like how it was originally just a short project about 8th graders getting into high school basketball, or how William Gates' story has so many surprises because they just didn't get to meet some of his family & friends until later in the shooting.  In short, this commentary track is never boring.The second commentary is another treasure, with Williams Gates and Arthur Agee doing their track.  And like the filmmakers' track, these two are engaging speakers with plenty to add to the film.  After all, they lived it, right?  It's so heart-warming to see these two speak honestly about their struggles, their dreams, their current lives, and their mutual respect & friendship.What's so terrific about this DVD is that in addition to getting a 3-hour masterpiece, there are 2 additional commentary tracks that broaden the scope even more!  You could literally spend 9 hours with this DVD, and still be dying to learn more about the world and people of ""Hoop Dreams"".  Never have I been so engaged, entertained, and inspired by such a DVD!I want to close with this quote from Roger Ebert, ""The greatest value of film is that it helps us break out of our boxes of time and space, and helps us to empathize with other people.  It lets us walk in someone else's shoes.  HOOP DREAMS, gave me that gift.""",5,A Gift That Keeps On Giving,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,8169,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'things', 'have', 'say', 'DVD', 'review', 'probably', 'wo',

The film was shot in analog video and then transfered to 35mm, and the editing they did is really amazing.

The film covers their 4 years of high school and the many games they play. The film also has interviews with members of their families and other events.I find this to be an excellent film and it shows that many of those who live in the ghetto are honest people too. The film does an excellent job at debunking many racial stereotypes about people who live in public housing as well. I was very touched by this film and feel compelled to help those who are less fortunate and wealthy than myself.The DVD has two audio commentaries that are great also. One is by the filmmakers and the other is by Agee and Gates.There is also the music video made to promote the film, scenes from the Siskel and Ebert show relevant to the film, two theatrical trailers, one of which was made especially for African-American audiences, and a booklet with updates on the Agee and Gates families.This is definately one of the best documentaries ever made.",5,An excellent documentary,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,1514,"['review', 'os', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'edition', 'film.Hoop', 'Dreams', 'highest', 'grossing', 'documentary', 'time', 'excluding', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'controversial', 'films', 'far', 'best', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'declared', 'best', 'film', '1995', 'Ebert', 'called', 'best', 'film', ""1990'sIt"", 'two', 'African-american', 'teenagers', 'Arthur', 'Agee', 'William', 'Gates', 'Chigago', 'Cabrini', 'Green', 'Housing', 'project', 'who', 'be', 'come', 'professional', 'basketball', 'players.Despite', 'low', 'income', 'are', 'given', 'scholarship', 'private', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'high', 'school', 'suburbs', 'film', '4', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'many', 'games', 'play', 'film', 'also', 'interviews', 'members', 'families', 'other', 'events.I', 'find', 'be', 'excellent', 'film', 'many', 'who', 'live', 'ghetto', 'are', 'honest', 'people', 'too', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'debunking', 'many', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'public', 'housing', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'touched', 'film', 'feel', 'compelled', 'help', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'fortunate', 'wealthy', 'myself.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'are', 'great', 'also', 'One', 'filmmakers', 'other', 'Agee', 'Gates.There', 'also', 'music', 'video', 'made', 'promote', 'film', 'scenes', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'show', 'relevant', 'film', 'two', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'one', 'was', 'made', 'especially', 'African-American', 'audiences', 'booklet', 'updates', 'Agee', 'Gates', 'families.This', 'definately', 'one', 'best', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

No Best Director Oscar to Hitchcock? No Best Director Oscar to Scorcese for ""Raging Bull"" or ""Goodfellas""? Both travesties. And there are a number of Best Picture Oscar Winners which are only remembered today because they won the Best Picture Oscar. Many of the films nominated the same year are still in the public consciousness because they are great, memorable, outstanding films. Some of the biggest mistakes perpetrated on the public by the Academy Awards have been in the Best Documentary category. ""The Thin Blue Line"", the groundbreaking documentary by Errol Morris, ""Roger and Me"", the wildly popular film by Michael Moore and ""Hoop Dreams"" were all passed up. ""Hoop Dreams"" was not the best documentary of 1994 but ""Maya Lin"" is?Anyone who knows me knows I hate sports. I have never liked to play them or watch them. I am a sports atheist. So, my love of ""Hoop Dreams"" may come as a surprise to many people.I think I am drawn to the film so much because, much like the more recent ""Murderball"", ""Dreams"" isn't about a sport so much as it is about two kids who love to play the sport. Basketball is a big factor in the lives of William Gates and Arthur Agee, two poor kids from the Chicago projects; they live, eat, dream about becoming professional basketball players, but the film covers their lives and how basketball impacts them as they grow up.Steve James, Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert, the filmmakers, worked on this project for eight years. Eight years! How many films have such a dedicated crew? During that time, they followed the lives of William, Arthur and their respective families from their freshman year of high school through their freshman year of college. Because of the access afforded to the filmmakers and the length of time they followed the two kids, the film presents a remarkably in-depth look at their lives. We follow William and Arthur for five years of their lives watching them grow up before our eyes. Both kids are good and want to make something of their lives, but various influences impact how their dreams will play out.Arthur's idol is Isiah Thomas, a former student at St. Joseph's, a private, predominately white Catholic high school in the suburbs. A talent scout spots William and Arthur playing and takes them to meet Gene Pingatore, Thomas' famous former coach. Pingatore places Arthur on the Freshman team and decides William is good enough to play Varsity. Through a series of incidents, Arthur is forced to return to his neighborhood high school where he joins the basketball team.As each of the kids begins to follow a different road, various influences and circumstances change each of their lives. William's brother, Curtis, a former basketball player in college, dropped out and now struggles to find even a minimum wage job. Yet, at every game, he knows what William should do to become a great basketball player. Arthur's mother, Sheila, throws her husband, Bo, out after he gets involved in drugs. Later, Bo returns to the family after drug rehab and a short stay in prison.The film also presents the positive moments in each person's life, balancing out the negative. Both are great basketball players; William receives a lot of notice from college scouts and gets a lot of write ups in the newspapers and Arthur gets some notice later from Junior College scouts.As the film covers the big moments in each year of their lives, their circumstances keep changing. It is amazing how dedicated each is to their sport, because they see it as the only way out of the projects. William has a living, breathing image of what could happen to him standing next to him at almost every turn, his bitter brother. When William finally receives an offer from Marquette University, Curtis denigrates it because he turned them down to attend a university in Florida. William's family life is the most stable, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't have his share of problems. At one point, he goes to Coach Pingatore for some advice on how to deal with these. The coach's response: ""Write them off"". Thankfully, Williams seems to realize the stupidity of this statement.Arthur's family life is a mess. His father is in and out of the picture, both financially and to provide guidance and emotional stability. His mother struggles to raise her family on welfare. Later in the film, Sheila attends an educational program to become a nurse's assistant. She learns that she received the highest grades in her class, providing a rare moment of unadulterated happiness in her life. As Arthur is forced out of Saint Joe's and has to return to the neighborhood high school, his spirit seems to go with him. At one point, he returns to Saint Joe's, for a visit, and seems to wish they would take him back.As the film comes to a close, the heart wrenching finale almost makes you cry. Both kids have such great talent and large dreams which will probably never be realized.This is an amazing documentary giving us great insight and depth into the lives of these two young men. It is an abomination that the film was not even nominated for Best Documentary at the 1995 Academy Awards.The Criterion Collection has released the film on DVD. The disc contains two audio commentaries, one with the filmmakers and another with William and Arthur which was recorded this year. There is also a collection of clips from ""Siskel and Ebert"" highlighting their efforts to champion the film from initial release, through the Academy Awards debacle and finally to Roger Ebert naming it his ""Favorite Film of the 90s"". Strangely enough, Ebert was sitting across from director Martin Scorcese (who was filling in for the recently departed Gene Siskel) when he named ""Hoop Dreams"" the best film of the 90s, a decade in which Scorcese released ""Goodfellas"".This is a film that everyone should see.
