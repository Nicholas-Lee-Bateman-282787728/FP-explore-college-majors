Both are based on real people and Helen Beardsley's autobiography, ""Who Gets the Drumstick?"" Carroll and Davis worked on all of Lucy Ball's TV shows (her DESILU co-produced this film). Melville Shavelson also directedTHE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS(1955),THE FIVE PENNIES(1959) andTHE WAR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN(1972).SYNOPSIS--When his wife dies, career Navy officer Frank Beardsley (Fonda) requests shore duty so he can take care of eight of his ten kids (the two youngest are temporarily ""loaned"" to a relative). Frank encounters at a grocer's Helen North (Ball), a Navy widow with eight children of her own. They arrange a dinner date; both ponder how to break the news about their large families. After Helen and Frank learn there's 18 kids between them, it's agreed this date will be a one and only.A meddling friend, Warrant Officer Darrel Harrison (Johnson) perceives these two are ideal for each other, so he arranges really bad blind dates for both and sends the couples to the same Japanese restaurant. When each sees the other with someone else, Frank and Helen realize they should be together. Thus, a family of 20 is born! By Christmas, the new Mrs. Beardsley gets her doctor's news that they'll soon be 21.At first, home life is chaos. Besides the logistics of sleeping arrangements and the preparation of daily feast-sized meals, there's a rivalry between the two groups of youngsters and resentment on both sides toward strange adults they feel are usurping a dead parents' place. Helen and Frank must find a way to weave these two warring factions into a real family.""Yours, Mine and Ours"" is an amusing story with considerable charm that's especially effective because it's obvious Lucy and Henry have a genuine rapport (according to daughter Jane, Mr. Fonda was in love with Miss Ball). Despite occasional dated references to psychedelics, short skirts and long hair, this squeaky-clean comedy has held up well and is most watchable.

Lightly based on a true story, it is mixed with heart-touching moments to downright hilarity.  If it is accuracy that you are looking for in this movie, you will not find it.

What are the odds that a widowed woman would meet a man who wanted to marry a woman with EIGHT children? And yet, it happened. It wasn't a marriage of convenience. They genuinely fell in love, probably for the last time in their lives. As others have said, this is based on a true story, which makes it all the more romantic. This is not a wacky comedy. It's a comedy, all right, with serious undertones and a message of love. A little unrealistic in some respects, but it's a movie. I've read that Henry Fonda was in love with Lucille Ball at one point. Watching how they act together in this movie, I could believe that. There's definitely some chemistry there. Fonda is at his best, in his older years. Lucille Ball still has it, in spades, in this movie. Is there anyone better with props? I don't think so. But don't overlook Van Johnson. He's hilarious in this movie, as Fonda's friend. But ultimately, it's about love. When the teenage girl asks Fonda about her boyfriend pressuring her to have sex, Fonda says, as he hurriedly escorts a very pregnant Ball to the car, ""Look at your mother."" Ball says ""Not NOW."" Fonda: ""Yes, now. Tell your boyfriend this is what it's all about. It's not having sex with a man that proves you love him. It's waking up with him in the morning to face the dreary but wonderful world with him that counts. It's having ground beef instead of round steak. It's wearing old shoes instead of new."" That's ultimately what the movie is about. Sentimental, yes. But not over the top schmaltzy. He marries a woman with eight children and a less than perfect body after having those 8 children, and she marries a man with ten children who is far from comfortable financially. Despite the obstacles, they're determined to make a happy home. And it's so very funny throughout the story. I've seen this movie several times, until I finally bought the DVD, since it doesn't come on tv very often. Oh, and...a couple of the kids ended up semi-famous. Tim Matheson and Morgan Brittany. And one of the young toddlers is Tracy Nelson, Rick Nelson's daughter who went on to star in a tv series with Tom Bosley, who plays a family doctor in this movie.Edited to add that I bought this used, as so many of the dvds I've bought. It was in perfect condition, just as all other used dvds I've bought have been. For those watching their pennies, buying used has worked out well for me.  The covers a couple of times were banged up, but the disks were perfect.

285855,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,6301977033,Chrijeff,"[8, 9]","Most of us, when we think of Lucille Ball, probably think of the slapstick character she played as Lucy Ricardo.  But in this film, she shows that she can handle a semi-serious role as well, and makes it easier to believe that under that ""screwball redhead"" exterior there dwelt a woman who became one of the richest and most powerful in the Hollywood of her day.  She plays Helen North, a nurse and Navy widow who moves from Seattle to San Francisco with her eight children (four of each) in the 1960's after her husband's accidental death.  There, working at the dispensary, she meets Frank Beardsley (Fonda), a career officer and widower who (unknown to her at the time) has *ten* children (three boys, seven girls).  Their romance is portrayed as low-key and gentle, with only two truly comic moments: a scene in a jam-packed downtown singles bar, and the sequence in which Helen is taken home to meet Frank's ""mafia""--and gets her drink spiked, not only by oldest son Mike, but both his brothers as well.  (Her ""crying drunk"" scene is as close as she comes to slapstick in the entire movie.)  Though there are many moments of humor, ""YM&O;"" is mostly about making a cohesive unit out of two families--dealing with the logistics of bedrooms, bathrooms, and meal preparation, getting the kids in each family to accept those in the other as well as the stepparent.  (Interestingly, it's Helen's next-to-youngest son Philip who seems to adjust the most smoothly, forming a bond with Mike (""That's my brother,"" he proudly tells his school-bus driver) and insisting to his teacher-nun that he's now a Beardsley rather than a North (""We all went to church and we all got married!"").)  In a day when families blended due to divorce were still uncommon, the lingering grief and resentment of each set of children is well portrayed, especially when Frank and Helen broach the idea of each adopting the other one's kids.  Frank's scene with Helen's oldest daughter, 17-year-old Colleen, as he tries, in the midst of the chaos attendant upon Helen going into labor with their first mutual child, to explain to her why she shouldn't ""do it"" with her boyfriend, is still relevant today.The children aren't angels, and shouldn't be: when Frank and Helen first meet, Helen has been a widow ""almost a year""--really not enough time for hers to have worked through their loss--and Frank's wife has probably been dead little longer, judging by the apparent ages of his two youngest children.  It's particularly interesting to watch the developing relationship of Mike Beardsley and his stepmother as they hold down the fort after Helen gives her blessing to Frank's going off to sea again--without telling him she's just learned of her pregnancy--and as Mike copes with the prospect of being drafted (he ultimately decides to sign up with the Marines instead).  As another reviewer has said, the process of becoming a man himself may open him to a better understanding of adult issues.I do take issue with the buyer who described Frank as ""slightly randy"" in the restaurant scene.  I always felt that he was a bit disconcerted by the clearly aggressive intentions of the blind date with whom he's been set up by his friend Darrell (played with a wink by Van Johnson), and wanted to make sure he could make a quick getaway without her (unchivalrous as it might seem) if she became any more obvious about it.  (Darrell, though at best a peripheral part of the action, also proves to be central to the development of the plot: a notorious skirt-chaser, he still realizes that Helen and Frank belong together, and slyly maneuvers things so that each will see the other with another person and come to understand that truth as well.  ""I had to lie, of course...You have to do that sometimes with the marrying kind,"" he says.)This would make a great film for any blended family--or families with the prospect of becoming blended--to watch together, to realize that certain issues are timeless, and that others have been finding ways to cope with them for years.  (In some ways it was probably harder for Frank and Helen: a dead spouse is likely to be idealized and missed, while a divorced one, even if you still have to share the kids with him/her, may be resented or even hated.)",4,"""Lucy"" shows another side--and Henry helps",1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,4260,"['Most', 'when', 'think', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'probably', 'think', 'slapstick', 'character', 'played', 'Lucy', 'Ricardo', 'film', 'can', 'handle', 'semi-serious', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'easier', 'believe', 'screwball', 'redhead', 'woman', 'who', 'became', 'one', 'richest', 'most', 'powerful', 'Hollywood', 'day', 'Helen', 'North', 'nurse', 'Navy', 'widow', 'who', 'Seattle', 'San', 'Francisco', 'eight', 'children', 'four', '1960', 'husband', 'accidental', 'death', 'working', 'dispensary', 'Frank', 'Beardsley', 'Fonda', 'career', 'officer', 'widower', 'who', 'unknown', 'time', '*ten*', 'children', 'three', 'boys', 'seven', 'girls', 'romance', 'portrayed', 'low-key', 'gentle', 'only', 'two', 'truly', 'comic', 'moments', 'scene', 'jam-packed', 'downtown', 'singles', 'bar', 'sequence', 'Helen', 'taken', 'home', 'meet', 'Frank', 'mafia', 'drink', 'spiked', 'not', 'only', 'oldest', 'son', 'Mike', 'brothers', 'as', 'well', 'crying', 'drunk', 'scene', 'as', 'close', 'slapstick', 'entire', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'humor', 'YM', 'O', 'mostly', 'making', 'cohesive', 'unit', 'two', 'families', 'dealing', 'logistics', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'meal', 'preparation', 'getting', 'kids', 'family', 'accept', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'stepparent', 'Interestingly', 'Helen', 'next-to-youngest', 'son', 'Philip', 'who', 'adjust', 'most', 'smoothly', 'forming', 'bond', 'Mike', 'brother', 'proudly', 'school-bus', 'driver', 'insisting', 'teacher-nun', 'now', 'Beardsley', 'rather', 'North', 'went', 'church', 'got', 'married', 'day', 'when', 'families', 'blended', 'due', 'divorce', 'were', 'still', 'uncommon', 'lingering', 'grief', 'resentment', 'set', 'children', 'well', 'portrayed', 'especially', 'when', 'Frank', 'Helen', 'broach', 'idea', 'adopting', 'other', 'one', 'kids', 'Frank', 'scene', 'Helen', 'oldest', 'daughter', '17-year-old', 'Colleen', 'midst', 'chaos', 'attendant', 'Helen', 'going', 'labor', 'first', 'mutual', 'child', 'explain', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'do', 'boyfriend', 'still', 'relevant', 'today.The', 'children', 'are', ""n't"", 'angels', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'when', 'Frank', 'Helen', 'first', 'meet', 'Helen', 'been', 'widow', 'almost', 'year', 'really', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'hers', 'have', 'worked', 'loss', 'Frank', 'wife', 'probably', 'been', 'dead', 'little', 'longer', 'judging', 'apparent', 'ages', 'two', 'youngest', 'children', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'watch', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Mike', 'Beardsley', 'stepmother', 'hold', 'down', 'fort', 'Helen', 'blessing', 'Frank', 'going', 'off', 'sea', 'again', 'telling', 'just', 'learned', 'pregnancy', 'Mike', 'prospect', 'being', 'drafted', 'ultimately', 'sign', 'up', 'Marines', 'instead', 'reviewer', 'said', 'process', 'becoming', 'man', 'may', 'open', 'better', 'understanding', 'adult', 'issues.I', 'do', 'take', 'issue', 'buyer', 'who', 'described', 'Frank', 'slightly', 'randy', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'bit', 'disconcerted', 'clearly', 'aggressive', 'intentions', 'blind', 'date', 'whom', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'friend', 'Darrell', 'played', 'wink', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'could', 'make', 'quick', 'getaway', 'unchivalrous', 'might', 'seem', 'became', 'more', 'obvious', 'Darrell', 'though', 'best', 'peripheral', 'part', 'action', 'also', 'be', 'central', 'development', 'plot', 'notorious', 'skirt-chaser', 'still', 'Helen', 'Frank', 'together', 'slyly', 'maneuvers', 'things', 'so', 'will', 'see', 'other', 'person', 'come', 'understand', 'truth', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'lie', 'course', 'have', 'do', 'marrying', 'kind', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'blended', 'family', 'families', 'prospect', 'becoming', 'blended', 'watch', 'together', 'realize', 'certain', 'issues', 'are', 'timeless', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'finding', 'ways', 'cope', 'years', 'ways', 'was', 'probably', 'harder', 'Frank', 'Helen', 'dead', 'spouse', 'likely', 'be', 'idealized', 'missed', 'divorced', 'one', 'even', 'still', 'have', 'share', 'kids', 'him/her', 'may', 'be', 'resented', 'even', 'hated']",N/A

What a wonderful thing to put two veterans of film and TV in the lead roles; some reviews have taken pains to mention that Ball and Fonda are a little advanced in age, but my feeling is they look- and more importantly ACT- like parents of a large brood of kids should. It's only a bonus for me that they are presented in a love story that isn't about cynical, worldly 20-year olds for once. They are allowed to discover love the second time around and actually be nervous about it!! They look great together, and perform even better. The real gem of the film is in the smart dialogue: The first date where one asks the other &quot;you DO like children, don't you?&quot; and the other says &quot;yeah- within reason!&quot; is only matched with the realization that &quot;eight and ten is-- ridiculous!!&quot; The film's a charmer.",4,Wonderful &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; predecessor.,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,1265,"['Oddly', 'enough', 'time', 'first', 'watched', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'never', 'once', 'thought', 'year-later', 'predecessor', 'quot', 'Brady', 'Bunch.', 'quot', 'mention', 'story', 'based', 'biography', 'real', 'Helen', 'North', 'Beardsley', 'so', 'good', 'surprisingly', 'astringent', 'parent/child', 'portrayals', 'completely', 'own-', 'happened', 'spin', 'off', 'much', 'more', 'sanitized', 'TV', 'series', 'more', 'power', 'What', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'put', 'two', 'veterans', 'film', 'TV', 'lead', 'roles', 'reviews', 'have', 'taken', 'pains', 'mention', 'Ball', 'Fonda', 'are', 'little', 'advanced', 'age', 'feeling', 'look-', 'more', 'importantly', 'ACT-', 'parents', 'large', 'brood', 'kids', 'should', 'only', 'bonus', 'are', 'presented', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'about', 'cynical', 'worldly', '20-year', 'olds', 'once', 'are', 'allowed', 'discover', 'love', 'second', 'time', 'actually', 'be', 'nervous', 'look', 'great', 'together', 'perform', 'even', 'better', 'real', 'gem', 'film', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'first', 'date', 'where', 'one', 'other', 'quot', 'DO', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'quot', 'other', 'quot', 'reason', 'quot', 'only', 'matched', 'realization', 'quot', 'eight', 'ten', 'ridiculous', 'quot', 'film', 'charmer']",N/A
285857,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,6301977033,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[2, 2]","It began on a movie studio backlot. During a break, actresses from a musical chorus line were lounging near a lunch truck. Buster Keaton, one of the great comedians in film history (The General (The Ultimate 2-Disc Edition) (1926)), strolled past and saw one of these women pretending to smoke a cigar with a stick of celery. The ladies around her laughed uproariously. Keaton made note and mentioned to a producer the actress had the comedic gift. ""She should be doing comedy.""Lucille Ball would eventually become one of the great comedians in history. By the time she made the fondly-remembered family film ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" in 1968, her extraordinary career was winding down. But there are moments when Ball's comedic gift flashes brilliantly, specifically during the family dinner when her drink is secretly spiked. This old, great dame of comedy (Lucille: The Life of Lucille Ball) rises to the occasion, and like those chorus girls long before my birth, I was laughing uproariously.There is much to love about this jovial family film, including an unbelievably true story (Who gets the drumstick?: The story of the Beardsley family), the terrific teaming of icons Ball and Henry Fonda, and salty dialog delivered with superb timing. It's stuck between multiple generations, alternating between unwieldy attempts at hip and cornball (akin to another fine family filmMr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation), but there is something warmly assuring watching this veteran cast deliver the goods.Ball is perfect as Helen North, a nurse and widowed mother of eight. Compared to her work inI Love Lucy: The Complete Series, it's actually a restrained and credible performance. Fonda plays the straight man Frank Beardsley, a widowed military father of 10 who falls for Ball's character, leading to marriage, a house of 20 family members and colorful detail of their attempts at daily survival. As many noted, this film was a great box office success, leading to the television seriesThe Brady Bunch: The Complete Series (Seasons 1-5 + Shag Carpet Cover). The key was the solid foundation of Ball, Fonda, a delightful Van Johnson and even Tom Bosley. Subtle, skilled and smooth, these veterans deliver classic lines of dialog raising the level of the film several notches.I think the efforts of director Melville Shavelson, a workman-like veteran with another fine family film on his resumeHouseboat, are also key. The scenes of Ball and Fonda's courtship, filmed in the busy streets of San Francisco, are tasteful and realistic. He keeps the frantic proceedings moving along, with enjoyable detail of the family's everyday existence.Produced during the height of the hippie craze, ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" makes several references to the Summer of Love. There's the obligatory hippie who eyes Ball at the bar and says, ""ridiculous."" A strapping teen (a young Ben Murphy), with a crush on older daughter Colleen (Jennifer Leak), is told to ""get a haircut."" And eventually, the famous speech by Fonda towards film's end, ""This is the real happening. If you want to know what love really is, take a look around you. It's giving life that counts. Until you're ready for it, all the rest is just a big fraud. All the crazy haircuts in the world won't keep it turning. Life isn't a love in, it's the dishes and the orthodontist and the shoe repairman and I'll tell you something else. It isn't going to a bed with a man that proves you're in love with him; it's getting up in the morning and facing the drab, miserable, wonderful everyday world with him that counts.""I think there are words of wisdom there. Certainly it's an inspiration to anyone attempting to raise and survive a family. Forty years down the road, this is still relevant advice, which speaks of the timeless quality of ""Yours, Mine and Ours."" There's a few cheap laughs, the child who eats too much, the short doctor who skips out on a date with Ball, but overall this is a film that works against large odds.

Ironically, it was released about a month before Robert Kennedy was assassinated, a pertinent fact since he was the Kennedy brother with by far the most children - eleven. The wholesome image of Kennedy as a young family man with a large brood is what much of the country responded to at the time, and this movie echoes those sentiments on a broader, sitcom level. It helps when you have two veterans like Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda play the leading roles as the widowed parents of sizable broods that combine eighteen children. One is a screen icon, the other America's most beloved TV comedienne. In hindsight, it seems predictably cautious for a movie set around the Alameda Naval Base to ignore the Vietnam War entirely, even though Fonda plays a naval officer and his oldest son a draftee.The plot is based on a true story as recounted in a 1964 memoir by Ball's character Helen North Beardsley. She was a part-time nurse on the base and a recently widowed mother of eight. In typical meet-cute fashion at the grocery store, Helen bumps into naval officer Frank Beardsley, the recently widowed father of ten children. They meet again at the clinic when his daughter needs female attention for her budding young womanhood. Their first date leads to the mutual revelation of the size of their respective families. Frank's best friend and fellow officer Darrel Harrison also knows Helen well and is determined to get them together through a pair of mismatched blind dates. Once Frank and Helen realize they are made for each other, the couple spends the rest of the movie trying to meld their warring families together into one happy unit. It's hardly a spoiler to say that they eventually succeed but not without a lot of trial and tribulation - including another baby on the way.Truth be told, Ball and Fonda are too old by a decade or so for their roles. However, it doesn't really matter since they are immensely likeable here. Even though she is given plenty ofLucyschtick to do between false eyelashes and toxic screwdrivers, Ball lends surprising dimension to Helen when it matters. Van Johnson is in typical wise-guy mode as Darrel, while Tom Bosley shows up as the befuddled family doctor. Among the children, you can recognize Tim Matheson as the eldest and most resentful of the pack and Morgan Brittany as a middle daughter, though the scene stealer is Eric Shea, who would have a memorable turn as the crafty kid inThe Poseidon Adventurefour years later. Reflecting on this film forty years later, I am struck by the pro-life message it seems to encourage, although religious themes are smartly avoided. The whole venture was directed and co-written by journeyman Melville Shavelson.

It hit close to home for me and became a favorite (like Princess Bride). When VHS became affordable, my children bought this for me for Christmas. We wore it out. Later, my youngest and only one left at home bought it for me again as a DVD. Now I watch it on Amazon Prime. Some critics don't like the message. Others think the children are poorly behaved. Yes, this is a positive promotion of a loving large family with normal behaving children. A lot of love, strict rules, and a husband that didn't criticize allowed the mother to do her job and change the hearts of the children.

If that sounds like a famous tv program, it is sort of, but that doesnt' take away from the enjoyment of this film.  Fonda and Ball are terrific together, and it is nice to see Lucy playing someone a little more real and normal.  She brings her great comedy timing, but also a lot of warmth and decency to the character.  The scenes with the eighteen kids in the house are a lot of fun, as is Lucy's drunk scene and the scenes surrounding their blind dates.

Hunt,"[89, 102]","One can set up a debate between a Jesuit priest supporting the sanctity of life and the secularist dedicated to worldwide birth control, but perhaps the message of the beauty and mystery and wonder of family would be better delivered by this comedy than by a recitation of the catechism.  Henry Fonda's character is right: nothing new has been written since ""Fanny Hill"".A reviewer wrote that she was disappointed at the children's disrespect toward the adults.  But I thought the children's less than perfect behavior was essential to the film and the film's message.  Yeah, having children, be it three or eighteen, is a burden.  There's no guarantee they'll be grateful for the sacrifices you make for them or that they'll allow you to have any sort of life of your own.  The children in the film are not angels.  Few are.  Indeed, I would argue they're rather normal, with the scales leaning heavily toward good.  They're bratty, tender, difficult, warm, self-centered and giving.  That's the beauty of life and humanity and it's more or less what Fonda tried to explain to Lucy's oldest daughter when she questioned him about sex.  ""You tell him that this is what it's all about.""Notice how the film places a certain amount of focus on Tim Matheson's character.  Early on, he spikes Lucy's drink and then giggles as she humiliates herself.  (Shades of the ""Otter"" character he would play ten years later.)  But eventually he decides that she's not so bad - at about the time, not coincidentally, that he's becoming a man - then he accepts her and, being a natural leader like his father, persuades his siblings to elect her ""our mother, for life"".That scene, indeed the whole film, would not have worked had the children been so unrealistically and quickly accepting of the stepmother.  As it's played and as it's written, it comes off without the sense of being false or manipulative.  Not an easy thing to do in film.Without meaning any disrespect, I feel a certain amount of pity for the reviewer that grew up in Germany and wrote that they considered families of four or more ""trash"".  (For the sake of Germany, I hope that's not true.)  To each his own, I suppose.  But if you can't appreciate this film and it's celebration of life and humanity, I'm not sure what you can enjoy.  I will say that people that come from large families almost always laugh more than people that do not.Still, I would not label ""Yours, Mine and Hours"" family values propaganda.  Had that been the intention, there would not have been the classic drunk scene nor the part where a somewhat randy Fonda tells the parking valet, ""Keep the motor running.""  I don't believe they were trying to do anything but tell a warm, funny story.

He has ten children, and she has eight.  Then, she gives birth to another.Beardsley tries to organize the 20 people in the family for the four bathrooms in the house, and the bedrooms.  The amount of groceries is astonishing, and the surnames of the children presents a problem in school, and an emotional issue with the children.A warrant officer in the Navy does not make much money, and speculating on that problem is interesting.  Although Fonda is shown with a commissioned officer's cap device, as is Van Johnson, unless the Navy has changed since I retired, they would be out of uniform.

The reason I like her in &quot;YMO&quot; is because she plays a mature woman without all that silly buffoonery in the TV show. Lucy is a very attractive woman here, and it's easy to see why naval officer Fonda would be drawn to her, even when a younger gal casts a glance or two at him during the courtship part. The one part I don't like is when Fonda's vindictive sons spike Lucy's drink when she comes over for dinner to meet the family. This results in the usual crying jag Lucy which turns me off.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 3]","Widow Helen North (Lucille Ball) and widower Frank Beardsley (Hendry Fonda) meet in a grocery store, each lugging a cart with huge mounds of food in them.  They each need to lug huge amounts of food because Helen has eight children and Frank has ten, though two of Frank's are temporarily on loan.With a little luck and a bit of manipulation on the part of Frank's friend Darrel Harrison (Van Johnson), Helen and Frank end up married, making a family of twenty!  The opportunity for humor is boundless, both before and after the marriage.  Before the marriage there are several opportunities for sexual references, lending a bit of credibility to the interplay between Helen and Frank.  After the marriage the focus tends to be more on the children and the family orientation of Helen and Frank.This film is at its best when it focuses on the real life problems of families in general.  The size related issues just add opportunities to the comedy and the warm fuzzy feeling you get when you see people who could be real deal with problems that look as though they could happen.This movie is one of those rare movies that looks fairly at the advantages and disadvantages of large families.  The other movies that I have seen that fall into this category are the original version of ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""Belles on Their Toes.""  None of these movies makes any sort of judgment on large families, positive or negative, but there is an incredible amount of love and understanding shared by all the members of the North-Beardsleys.  Note that the real-life story of Helen Eileen Beardsley and her husband inspired this movie.I originally watched this movie in the 1960's.  I was pleased that the movie is even more charming than I remembered.  It may be that having children of my own (though no where near eighteen!) has affected my view of this movie.  I strongly recommend this movie for families everywhere, particularly where the children are getting older and more selfish.

285930,A3MGDTPZVEDGR3,6301977033,phillindholm,"[3, 4]","""Yours Mine And Ours"" is one of the best ""family films"" of the 1960s. (Very) loosely based on the real-life story of Helen North, a Navy widow with eight children, who married Navy career man Frank Beardsley, a widower with ten children of his own. Lucille Ball bought the rights to Mrs. Beardsley's book ""Who Gets The Drumstick?"", co- produced it, and took the starring role of Helen North. For those who know her chiefly as a comedienne, this film will be a pleasant surprise. For not only does she have the opportunity to indulge in some of the slapstick she is famous for, she proves conclusively that she was an excellent dramatic actress as well. Moreover, she can switch abruptly (and seemingly effortlessly) from comedy to pathos, sometimes in the same scene! Henry Fonda takes the part of Frank Beardsley and gives it both dimension and strength. As his bachelor friend, Van Johnson is a welcome presence, as is Tom Bosley as a sardonic doctor. There is also a hilarious performance from Louise Troy, as Frank's date early in the story. The kids are well cast and include future notables Tim Matheson, Suzanne Cupito (who grew up to be Morgan Brittany), Mitch Vogel and Tracy Nelson. A good deal of the plot involves the mutual dislike most of the kids have for their step-siblings, but a great deal of charm is present as well. Aiding the production is a nice score by Fred Karlin, a lovely song ""It's A Sometimes World"", and handsome San Francisco location photography. A remake has just been completed and will be released around the holiday season, but it's not likely to top this one. Incidentally, if you read the original book by Helen Beardsley, you will most likely come away with a far different picture of the Beardsley family, one which may not have transferred as well to the screen. This may also explain why there is no mention of the book as the story source in the movie's opening credits.

285945,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301977033,Simon Davis,"[5, 7]","1968 seemed to be the year in Hollywood for showing the trials and tribulations of the blended family as it saw not only the premeire of this terrific family comedy but also the Doris Day vehicle ""With Six You Get Egg Roll"", which was then followed by TV's ""The Brady Bunch"". This delightful take on the troubles two families encounter when they come together proved to be an ideal starring vehicle for both Lucy and Henry Fonda and it proved Lucy's continuing ability to be a Box Office draw in the cinemas while still remaining one of televisions most enduring superstars. In fact Lucy has never been better than here and her character of the mother shows her as an accomplished and mature actress who still manages to instill the proceedings with a few hilarious doses of the old Lucy magic we have all come to expect from her decades reign as television's Queen of comedy.Based on an actual true story written by the real Helen North Beardsley, ""Yours, Mine and Ours"", traces the story of two families coming together under the one roof with all the chaos, readjustments, heartbreak and compromises you could imagine that entails. Helen North (Lucille Ball), is a widow recently moved to San Francisco with her eight young children where she works at the Naval dispensary as a nurse while Frank Beardsley (Henry Fonda), a widower is a Naval Officer thinking about retirement who has ten children. They run into each other on the base and are instantly attracted to each other and through the machinations of Frank's best friend Darrel (Van Johnson), the two begin dating. Both are terrified of the other finding out about their large broods but when this is revealed they see the enormity of the task possibly ahead of them with eighteen children. They decide to cool the relationship and both end up having disastrous dates with other people who they have nothing in common with and who are both horrified by the prospect of the number of children involved. Meeting by accident at a Chinese restaurant while on their separate ""dates"", Helen and Frank realise they are really meant for each other. The brief courtship is not a smooth one however because of the very strong objections of both sets of children, culminating in a terrible ""getting to know you"" dinner at Frank's house where his boys get helen deliberately drunk. However true love finds its way and the couple wed. The real trouble then starts as a master plan that would do the navy proud is put into place to get all members of the extended family under the same roof. The family cope with new family members on both sides, lack of electricity, ""unknown"" family doctors, cramped living space and a lack of privacy along the way to finding true family togetherness. The whole blending of these two families then amazingly comes to a climax when Helen announces that she is pregnant! The upcoming birth finally starts to thaw some of the hostilities in the group and by the time eldest son Mike is called up to active duty and the new baby is finally born after a comic rush to the hospital the family are well and truly ""ours"", as opposed to ""yours"", or ""mine"".A big success at the Box Ofice in 1968 ""Yours, Mine and Ours"", sadly marked Lucy's swan song as a draw in theatres as her only released feature following this effort was the much maligned 1974 version of ""Mame"". Here however she is still in fine form with a character often far removed from her dizzy Lucy character from ""I Love lucy"", fame. She proves her worth as a mature actress in both the crazy ""Lucy"" style moments that we have come to expect from her such as the hilarious drunk scene and when her false eyelash runs amuck, to the more quieter moments where her character of Helen comes across as a caring and intelligent woman as seen in the scenes when she and Heny Fonda go shopping in San Francisco and when she manages to finally make a connection with Frank's eldest son Mike. Lucy and Henry Fonda enjoy a quite unexpected and nicely believable chemistry on screen here as the two mature adults overwhelmed with parental responsibility after the death of their spouses who unexpectedly experience a second chance at love. Their attempts at keeping this love, and later a marriage intact despite all the obstacles and demands placed on them is a delight and is a testiment to the combined years of experience that both veterans brought to their roles. The assorted children of both parties who come together in this ""blended family"", are your typical 1960's film or TV children, fast with the wise cracks and physical comedy. Tim Matheson who went on to success as an adult performer is the real standout of the children as eldest son Mick Beardsley and he manages to create a believable character with some dimension to it in between all the comic chaos. His work with Lucille Ball in particular is well done as he begins to ""thaw"", in his attitude towards his new step mother. At times of course ""Yours, Mine and Ours"", has the look and feel of a sitcom about it which I dont see as a failing at all and the presense of TV regulars such as Tom Bosley as the family doctor and Ysabel MacCloskey as a disgruntled house keeper only reinforces that belief. The script for ""Yours, Mine and Ours"", was penned by Bob Carroll Jr, and Madelyn Davis who were long time ""Lucy"" writers right back to the ""I Love lucy"", days and with former co star from MGM Van Johnson playing Warrant officer Darrel Harrison, Lucille Ball really had a reunion of sorts with old collegues while working on this film. Finally Madeleine Love as Fonda's unsatisfactory ""date"", also has a great comic scene when she shares a car home with Frank and Helen during which they realise their love for each other and fail to notice her sitting between them. The San Francisco locale provides a perfect backdrop to the story and the cinemtography courtesy of Charles F. Wheeler is first rate in capturing the beauty of the city and the unique feel of the many ship board scenes involving Henery Fonda's character.Funny, warm, and often thought provoking family stories such as that contained in this film are a rare breed in present day Hollywood where the trend is now for cynical and often mean spirited depictions of families and their failings. ""Yours, Mine and Ours"", came along in the last breath of innocence in Hollywood film making in the late 1960's and is really part of a now lost era of how families are depicted on screen. Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda had some of their last really endearing characters to play here and those viewers just used to the zany ""Lucy"", from the fantastic redhead's enduring television shows are in for a bit of a surprise seeing Lucy's range of emotions and her often subtle playing in this story. I personally love ""Yours, Mine and Ours"", and love it's touching as well as highly comical moments. Old style movie making of the very best kind ""Yours, Mine and Ours"",is highly recommended.",5,Delightful Comedy With Lucy And Henry Fonda In Fine Form,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,6935,"['1968',

285954,A34D9Q0JTF7N7K,6301977033,Susan,"[6, 62]","A friend brought this over today for us to watch together. I had my doubts, for we generally steer clear of movies made in the 60's and later, and we even avoid some 50's films. I vaguely remember seeing this when I was a child, but remembered nothing. So anyway, I obliged my friend and watched. I must say my doubts were correct, and we were both disappointed. It was typical of 60's and onward movies, where all the children have to be bratty and have attitudes, disrespect parents, etc. I don't appreciate Hollywood's way of picturing children in this light. And I don't want my children to watch other children who behave in this way. I felt the parenting was not the greatest either...I mean, if your son is up late reading a Playboy magazine, would you just quietly slip it from his hand and say nothing about it? I found that scene very weird. There were also other suggestive and sexual things about this film, though subtle, that would make me not allow my children to watch this film. Nor did I appreciate the scene where the boys make Lucy's drink so strong she gets drunk. How interesting though, when she tasted it, she looked just like she did when she first tasted ""Vitameatavegamin"" on her TV show! Lucy will always be ""I  Love Lucy"" in my mind, and noone else. I don't care for Henry Fonda much, but in this he was a bit more tolerable than usual. Maybe because he was older. One scene that was funny was how they both were grocery shopping (after marriage) and had 4 overflowing carts of groceries, and you are wondering what the bill is going to come to, and here it was only $126! Wow, for 4 carts of groceries! How the times have changed. But I remember growing up in the 70's and my mom only spent $40 a week for our family of 6. Now, I am sure they would have had to spend closer to $500, maybe more, for all those groceries. The 60's hairstyles and clothes were so so so disgusting...I can't believe people actually dressed like that. I think the late 60's and all of the 70's is a time that would be nice to be erased from the memory of fashion history. But then, we see much of it back today. Why???  I want to say too, that not all large families operate like it is chaos going on all the time.  I have known many large families who really have it together. Well, I haven't a whole lot to say, for it was only a so-so film and one I won't watch again. Neither will my friend. I mostly wanted to say to parents who really care about presenting their children with good values and morals, that I wouldn't recommend this as a family film. If you want to watch a 60's film with nice children, watch The Sound of Music. Or get your children some nice classic films from the 20's-40's to watch. My children love the old films, even silent ones. I am sure yours would too.",1,"Not at all a ""Family Film"" in my opinion",1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,2793,"['friend', 'brought', 'today', 'watch', 'together', 'had', 'doubts', 'generally', 'steer', 'clear', 'movies', 'made', '60', 'later', 'even', 'avoid', '50', 'films', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'seeing', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'remembered', 'nothing', 'So', 'anyway', 'obliged', 'friend', 'watched', 'must', 'say', 'doubts', 'were', 'correct', 'were', 'disappointed', 'was', 'typical', '60', 'onward', 'movies', 'where', 'children', 'have', 'be', 'bratty', 'have', 'attitudes', 'disrespect', 'parents', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'picturing', 'children', 'light', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'children', 'watch', 'other', 'children', 'who', 'behave', 'way', 'felt', 'parenting', 'was', 'not', 'greatest', 'mean', 'son', 'up', 'late', 'reading', 'Playboy', 'magazine', 'would', 'just', 'quietly', 'slip', 'hand', 'say', 'nothing', 'found', 'scene', 'very', 'weird', 'were', 'also', 'other', 'suggestive', 'sexual', 'things', 'film', 'though', 'subtle', 'would', 'make', 'not', 'allow', 'children', 'watch', 'film', 'did', 'appreciate', 'scene', 'where', 'boys', 'make', 'Lucy', 'drink', 'so', 'strong', 'drunk', 'How', 'interesting', 'though', 'when', 'tasted', 'looked', 'just', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'tasted', 'Vitameatavegamin', 'TV', 'show', 'Lucy', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'mind', 'noone', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'much', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'tolerable', 'usual', 'Maybe', 'was', 'older', 'One', 'scene', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'how', 'were', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'marriage', 'had', '4', 'overflowing', 'carts', 'groceries', 'are', 'wondering', 'what', 'bill', 'going', 'come', 'here', 'was', 'only', '126', 'Wow', '4', 'carts', 'groceries', 'How', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'remember', 'growing', 'up', '70', 'mom', 'only', 'spent', '40', 'week', 'family', '6', 'Now', 'am', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'spend', 'closer', '500', 'maybe', 'more', 'groceries', '60', 'hairstyles', 'clothes', 'were', 'so', 'so', 'so', 'disgusting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'actually', 'dressed', 'think', 'late', '60', '70', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'be', 'erased', 'memory', 'fashion', 'history', 'then', 'see', 'much', 'back', 'today', 'Why', 'want', 'say', 'too', 'not', 'large', 'families', 'operate', 'chaos', 'going', 'time', 'have', 'known', 'many', 'large', 'families', 'who', 'really', 'have', 'together', 'Well', 'have', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'say', 'was', 'only', 'so-so', 'film', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'friend', 'mostly', 'wanted', 'say', 'parents', 'who', 'really', 'care', 'presenting', 'children', 'good', 'values', 'morals', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'family', 'film', 'want', 'watch', '60', 'film', 'nice', 'children', 'watch', 'Sound', 'Music', 'get', 'children', 'nice', 'classic', 'films', ""20's-40"", 'watch', 'children', 'love', 'old', 'films', 'even', 'silent', 'ones', 'am', 'sure', 'yours', 'would', 'too']",N/A

While they're riding the trolley we see her point of view as he tells her that he has 10 kids and we see the street suddenly turn upside down in front of her! There's a lot of subtle touches in this movie like that.  And it's still enjoyable  after all these years.  Unlike the Brady Bunch, the younger kids act (mostly) like real little kids, bickering, bawling, and  not always behaving or even liking each other. Tim Matheson's character is as far removed from 'Boone' in Animal House that you can get, even (happily) joining the army!
