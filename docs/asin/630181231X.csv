I have to say I like that the movie loops and you don't have to restart it. That is helpful when you cant find the remote and have the flu. lol,3,helpful,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,265,"['used', 'boy', 'one', 'son', 'years', 'ago', 'course', 'bought', 'one', 'elmo', 'one', 'daughter', 'was', 'helpful', 'have', 'say', 'like', 'movie', 'loops', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'restart', 'helpful', 'when', 'cant', 'find', 'remote', 'have', 'flu', 'lol']",N/A

Toddlers aren't good at guessing games. If you want to teach them something, you have to give them clear instructions. I believe this video demonstrates very well how the little girl is learning to use her new potty.",5,Good choice for potty training,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,349,"['very', 'literal', 'describing', 'little', 'girls', 'body', 'parts', 'opinion', 'better', 'beating', 'bush', 'Toddlers', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'guessing', 'games', 'want', 'teach', 'something', 'have', 'give', 'clear', 'instructions', 'believe', 'video', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'little', 'girl', 'learning', 'use', 'new', 'potty']",N/A

The actual animation is short, but it's content is good, like discussing where pee and poop come out. This is not the kind of DVD to get if you hope it will train your kid merely by watching it. It's cute, and my toddler likes it, but it's priced too high for how short it is.

Yes, the potty chair doesn't look like the potty that everyone I know uses, but my two year old wasn't that analytical about the look of the potty. She knew what the little girl was trying to do- what she herself tried to do, and failed. When that little girl made the ""poo poo"" in the potty, my daughter went into the bathroom and sat and did it too. She must have thought that if SHE can do it, I can too.This was an effective little movie for us!

She watched this video when she was two, I gave her lots of juice and water so she had a full bladder and I set her lil potty in front of the tv. I turned the video on and she peed in the potty! And she went on her lil potty from that day on! It was a very successful video, it made her be proud to go on the potty and feel sucesful that she could acomplish the task.  I would recommend this video to everyone! My dauhgter wanted to watch it all the time, so I let her! She loves to sing along with the video. And she was fully potty trained by 2 and a half.

I do like the way all of the girls body parts are explained and what you are to use them for.Over all I like it but was hoping that it would entice my 2 yr old to want to do all the same things as the girl character not just to dance. I would recommend this to anyone with a little girl but start a little earlier then I did. This might have worked better if I had gotten this when she first showed signs of wanting to learn to use the potty instead of waiting 7months til she was bored of the potty thing and dependant on diapers out of laziness!,4,Once Upon a Potty for Her!!,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,980,"['2', 'yr', 'showing', 'signs', 'ready', 'start', 'potty', 'training', 'process', 'started', 'process', 'refused', 'go', 'potty', 'so', 'got', 'DVD', 'see', 'would', 'help', 'seeing', 'little', 'girl', 'doing', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'daughter', 'Very', 'stubborn', 'only', 'other', 'girls', 'music', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'sit', 'potty', 'simulate', 'what', 'character', 'doing', 'do', 'way', 'girls', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'explained', 'what', 'are', 'use', 'for.Over', 'like', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'entice', '2', 'yr', 'old', 'want', 'do', 'same', 'things', 'girl', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'dance', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'little', 'girl', 'start', 'little', 'earlier', 'then', 'did', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'gotten', 'when', 'first', 'showed', 'signs', 'wanting', 'learn', 'use', 'potty', 'instead', 'waiting', '7months', 'til', 'was', 'bored', 'potty', 'thing', 'dependant', 'diapers', 'laziness']",N/A
