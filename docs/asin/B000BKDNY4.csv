943693,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000BKDNY4,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Apart from its somewhat disingenuous and sensationalistic title and description, this NOVA presentation offers a fascinating and immensely interesting look at the life and influence of Sir Isaac Newton.  Let's go ahead and deal with the obvious question: exactly what are these ""dark secrets"" of Newton?  1) he secretly and earnestly practiced the banned art of alchemy for many years and 2) he believed, contrary to the myth of Newton as the great rationalist, in an all-powerful God but secretly held anti-Trinitarian thoughts that would have been considered deeply heretical (and unlawful) in the England of his time.  In fact, Newton wrote more about religion and alchemy than he did math and physics.  Truth be told, though, a great deal is made of these ""dark secrets"" primarily because they have only come to light in recent years.It was John Maynard Keynes, who purchased a significant collection of Newton's private papers 1936, who dubbed Newton ""the last of the magicians"" (in his ""Newton, the Man"" essay).  Despite the Keynes-inspired subtitle, though, this documentary never mentions the word ""magician.""  In fact, it does a great job of putting Newton's alchemical and theological work in the context of his search for the ultimate truths of the universe.  Newton didn't spend untold years trying to turn iron into gold.  In a sense, alchemy is all about the study of matter, and one of the scientists interviewed here shows that Newton's alchemical studies had a degree of scientific merit.  I would argue that Newton's theological work is much more important in terms of redefining our image of this most preeminent of all scientists, though.  For centuries, Newton was presented as a champion of rationalism and reason, a man who believed nothing that could not be proven scientifically.  Now we know that Newton believed that the universe, with all of its beautiful intricacies, could only have been created by a Supreme Being, and it is fascinating to learn that Newton was pursuing Bible codes centuries ago - and that he even used all of the knowledge he gained to predict the year in which the world would end.Taken as a whole, though, the documentary covers Newton's entire life and delivers a formidable portrait of this reclusive genius.  He was a most singular man, an introvert who pursued his studies (on a vast array of topics) eighteen hours a day, every day.  His most famous accomplishments are enumerated, of course: his laws of motion, his invention of calculus (which he kept to himself for two decades), his groundbreaking work in optics, etc., and several are explained in ways that most laymen can comprehend.  To its credit, the story never resorts to unfounded speculation about Newton's personal life, but it does mention his inability to accept criticism in anything but a highly charged, negative fashion.  Oddly enough, though, the documentary only explores Newton's intense spats with Robert Hooke - no mention is made of Gottfried Leibniz or the controversy over the invention of calculus.Physicists tend to be a lively and entertaining bunch these days, and those who are interviewed over the course of this documentary certainly fit the bill in this regard.  My favorite quote comes out of a discussion over the historical validity of a falling apple inspiring Newton's conceptualization of gravity: ""I'm extremely skeptical of the role of fruit in Newton's life.""  To me, that's funny, but of course I'm a nerd.  You don't have to be a nerd to appreciate this documentary, however.  After Jesus Christ, Newton may well have been the most influential person to ever live, and his ""dark secrets"" only serve to make this preeminent man of science all the more fascinating.  You can't help but marvel at the genius of this extraordinary man after watching this documentary.",5,An utterly fascinating look at the life of Sir Isaac Newton,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,3818,"['Apart', 'somewhat', 'disingenuous', 'sensationalistic', 'title', 'description', 'NOVA', 'presentation', 'fascinating', 'immensely', 'interesting', 'look', 'life', 'influence', 'Sir', 'Isaac', 'Newton', 'Let', 'go', 'ahead', 'deal', 'obvious', 'question', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Newton', '1', 'secretly', 'earnestly', 'practiced', 'banned', 'art', 'alchemy', 'many', 'years', '2', 'believed', 'contrary', 'myth', 'Newton', 'great', 'rationalist', 'all-powerful', 'God', 'secretly', 'held', 'anti-Trinitarian', 'thoughts', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'deeply', 'heretical', 'unlawful', 'England', 'time', 'fact', 'Newton', 'wrote', 'more', 'religion', 'alchemy', 'did', 'math', 'physics', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'though', 'great', 'deal', 'made', 'dark', 'secrets', 'primarily', 'have', 'only', 'come', 'light', 'recent', 'years.It', 'was', 'John', 'Maynard', 'Keynes', 'who', 'purchased', 'significant', 'collection', 'Newton', 'private', 'papers', '1936', 'who', 'dubbed', 'Newton', 'last', 'magicians', 'Newton', 'Man', 'essay', 'Keynes-inspired', 'subtitle', 'though', 'documentary', 'never', 'word', 'magician', 'fact', 'great', 'job', 'putting', 'Newton', 'alchemical', 'theological', 'work', 'context', 'search', 'ultimate', 'truths', 'universe', 'Newton', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'untold', 'years', 'trying', 'turn', 'iron', 'gold', 'sense', 'alchemy', 'study', 'matter', 'one', 'scientists', 'interviewed', 'here', 'Newton', 'alchemical', 'studies', 'had', 'degree', 'scientific', 'merit', 'would', 'argue', 'Newton', 'theological', 'work', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'terms', 'redefining', 'image', 'most', 'preeminent', 'scientists', 'though', 'centuries', 'Newton', 'was', 'presented', 'champion', 'rationalism', 'reason', 'man', 'who', 'believed', 'nothing', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'proven', 'scientifically', 'Now', 'know', 'Newton', 'believed', 'universe', 'beautiful', 'intricacies', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'Supreme', 'Being', 'fascinating', 'learn', 'Newton', 'was', 'pursuing', 'Bible', 'codes', 'centuries', 'even', 'used', 'knowledge', 'gained', 'predict', 'year', 'world', 'would', 'end.Taken', 'whole', 'though', 'documentary', 'covers', 'Newton', 'entire', 'life', 'formidable', 'portrait', 'reclusive', 'genius', 'was', 'most', 'singular', 'man', 'introvert', 'who', 'pursued', 'studies', 'vast', 'array', 'topics', 'eighteen', 'hours', 'day', 'day', 'most', 'famous', 'accomplishments', 'are', 'enumerated', 'course', 'laws', 'motion', 'invention', 'calculus', 'kept', 'two', 'decades', 'groundbreaking', 'work', 'optics', 'etc.', 'several', 'are', 'explained', 'ways', 'most', 'laymen', 'can', 'comprehend', 'credit', 'story', 'never', 'unfounded', 'speculation', 'Newton', 'personal', 'life', 'mention', 'inability', 'accept', 'criticism', 'anything', 'highly', 'charged', 'negative', 'fashion', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'though', 'documentary', 'only', 'Newton', 'intense', 'spats', 'Robert', 'Hooke', 'mention', 'made', 'Gottfried', 'Leibniz', 'controversy', 'invention', 'calculus.Physicists', 'tend', 'be', 'lively', 'entertaining', 'bunch', 'days', 'who', 'are', 'interviewed', 'course', 'documentary', 'certainly', 'fit', 'bill', 'regard', 'favorite', 'quote', 'discussion', 'historical', 'validity', 'falling', 'apple', 'inspiring', 'Newton', 'conceptualization', 'gravity', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'skeptical', 'role', 'fruit', 'Newton', 'life', 'funny', 'course', ""'m"", 'nerd', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'nerd', 'appreciate', 'documentary', 'however', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Newton', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'influential', 'person', 'ever', 'live', 'dark', 'secrets', 'only', 'serve', 'make', 'preeminent', 'man', 'science', 'more', 'fascinating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'marvel', 'genius', 'extraordinary', 'man', 'watching', 'documentary']",NOVA: Newton's Dark Secrets

His father passed when he was young. To add insult to injury his mother re-married and deserted him, leaving him with his grandparents. He was not a social junkie by any stretch of the imagination. Matter of fact, he was quite the recluse. He was far more interested in his studies and of course, the world is better of for that.The documentary gets into several of his accomplishments. Probably one of the most famous, his discovery of Calculus or the ""Quantitative understanding of the way things change"". This forms the backbone of all modern science. It's even used in the stock market. He was ""the greatest mathematician the world had ever seen at 22 years old"". He also discovered the truth about light (prism effect, figured out that white light isn't pure, it's the presence of all color).After becoming a professor at Cambridge, he became an alchemist. It's interesting that he would do this as a scientist, when so many scientists discredited it. Newton was also obsessed with biblical math and what ""secret codes"" the bible held.This is definitely a great look into one of the greatest minds to ever come into this world. Very interesting and it isn't super long so it should hold your attention well.",5,Great Look at a Genius,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,1298,"['great', 'inner', 'look', 'who', 'Newton', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'dedicated', 'work', 'father', 'passed', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'mother', 're-married', 'deserted', 'leaving', 'grandparents', 'was', 'not', 'social', 'junkie', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'Matter', 'fact', 'was', 'quite', 'recluse', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'studies', 'course', 'world', 'better', 'that.The', 'documentary', 'several', 'accomplishments', 'Probably', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'discovery', 'Calculus', 'Quantitative', 'understanding', 'way', 'things', 'change', 'backbone', 'modern', 'science', 'even', 'used', 'stock', 'market', 'was', 'greatest', 'mathematician', 'world', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', '22', 'years', 'old', 'also', 'discovered', 'truth', 'light', 'prism', 'effect', 'figured', 'out', 'white', 'light', ""n't"", 'pure', 'presence', 'color', '.After', 'becoming', 'professor', 'Cambridge', 'became', 'alchemist', 'interesting', 'would', 'do', 'scientist', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'scientists', 'discredited', 'Newton', 'was', 'also', 'obsessed', 'biblical', 'math', 'what', 'secret', 'codes', 'bible', 'held.This', 'definitely', 'great', 'look', 'one', 'greatest', 'minds', 'ever', 'come', 'world', 'Very', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'super', 'long', 'should', 'hold', 'attention', 'well']",NOVA: Newton's Dark Secrets

It was beautifully done and the casting was excellent presenting an actor who resembled early drawings and paintings of Sir Isaac. In order to gain popular interest it was named ""Newton's Dark Secrets"" and documented his personal investigations into the occult arts including alchemy, numerology, and even bible predictions. I have read that a large number of his papers were burned around the time of his death, perhaps to conceal this portion of his interesting life from discovery. In any case, as mentioned by another writer it covered much more of his life than his occult interests. I found most interesting the fact that he did not wish to talk about or publish his early scientific studies, but once he was convinced to talk about them one had better believe what Isaac said or one would be in for a major ""debate"".

It's very well-done and obviously thoroughly researched. What I liked best was that it conveyed Newton's character without glossing over his faults, but still sympathetically.

Newton's conception of the laws of motion was one of the most profound developments in physics.  Because of their mathematical simplicity and accuracy, these laws (and others formulated by Newton such as the universal law of gravitation) are still used to predict and describe the motion of larger objects (even the motions of celestial objects).Most people are familiar with Newton's genius as a physicist (which this documentary details exquisitely) but they are probably unfamiliar with his secret obsession revealed in documents found in the twenty-first century.  To give you a hint of what this extraordinary documentary reveals, here are the titles of its scene selections:(1) Introduction (2) A new science (3) Isaac Newton, the alchemist (4) Combing the Bible (5) A different Isaac Newton(Alchemy was an early form of chemistry, with philosophic and magical associations.)A further hint of what is revealed in this stunning documentary comes when the viewer is told:""[Newton] wrote more about theology and alchemy than science and math combined.""This program is narrated by actor F. Murray Abraham.  Kudos to actor Scott Handy in his portrayal of Newton in the vivid docudrama scenes.  I found the creation of late seventeenth century England excellent.Throughout the program are brief comments made by a few scholars.  I found all their comments interesting.The DVD (the one released in 2006) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are a few extras that some viewers may find interesting.Finally, the only problem I found is that the program was not long enough.  I wanted to know more.  This personal fact reveals just how good this program is!In conclusion, certainly learn from this program why Newton became the giant on whose shoulders all later scientists (including Einstein) would find a place to stand.  But also learn about his other secret interests including the date he calculated the world would come to an end!!!(originally aired on TV on the science series ""Nova"" in 2005;  55 min; wide screen;  closed-captioned;  5 scenes)+++++",5,"""Who was the REAL Isaac Newton?""",1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,2384,"['+++++Whenever', 'one', 'object', 'force', 'second', 'object', 'second', 'object', 'reactive', 'force', 'equal', 'magnitude', 'opposite', 'direction', 'first', 'object.The', 'above', 'modern', 'worded', 'version', 'third', 'law', 'motion', 'formulated', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'scientist', 'time', 'Sir', 'Isaac', 'Newton', '1642', '1727', 'Newton', 'conception', 'laws', 'motion', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'profound', 'developments', 'physics', 'mathematical', 'simplicity', 'accuracy', 'laws', 'others', 'formulated', 'Newton', 'such', 'universal', 'law', 'gravitation', 'are', 'still', 'used', 'predict', 'describe', 'motion', 'larger', 'objects', 'even', 'motions', 'celestial', 'objects', '.Most', 'people', 'are', 'familiar', 'Newton', 'genius', 'physicist', 'documentary', 'details', 'exquisitely', 'are', 'probably', 'unfamiliar', 'secret', 'obsession', 'revealed', 'documents', 'found', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'give', 'hint', 'what', 'extraordinary', 'documentary', 'reveals', 'here', 'are', 'titles', 'scene', 'selections', '1', 'Introduction', '2', 'new', 'science', '3', 'Isaac', 'Newton', 'alchemist', '4', 'Combing', 'Bible', '5', 'different', 'Isaac', 'Newton', 'Alchemy', 'was', 'early', 'form', 'chemistry', 'philosophic', 'magical', 'associations', 'further', 'hint', 'what', 'revealed', 'stunning', 'documentary', 'when', 'viewer', 'told', 'Newton', ']', 'wrote', 'more', 'theology', 'alchemy', 'science', 'math', 'combined', 'program', 'narrated', 'actor', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Kudos', 'actor', 'Scott', 'Handy', 'portrayal', 'Newton', 'vivid', 'docudrama', 'scenes', 'found', 'creation', 'late', 'seventeenth', 'century', 'England', 'program', 'are', 'brief', 'comments', 'made', 'few', 'scholars', 'found', 'comments', 'interesting.The', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '2006', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'interesting.Finally', 'only', 'problem', 'found', 'program', 'was', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'personal', 'fact', 'reveals', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'program', 'conclusion', 'certainly', 'learn', 'program', 'why', 'Newton', 'became', 'giant', 'shoulders', 'later', 'scientists', 'including', 'Einstein', 'would', 'find', 'place', 'stand', 'also', 'learn', 'other', 'secret', 'interests', 'including', 'date', 'calculated', 'world', 'would', 'come', 'end', 'originally', 'aired', 'TV', 'science', 'series', 'Nova', '2005', '55', 'min', 'wide', 'screen', 'closed-captioned', '5', 'scenes', '+++++']",NOVA: Newton's Dark Secrets
