996368,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000FUTVL4,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[2, 25]","Seeing as how this film does seem aimed at children aged 1 year and under I have apparently arrived on the scene about 24 years too late. So for everybody else who took this journey, as I did, I only have to say that if children's entertainment was always this bad no kid would ever want to watch TV. Lucky for them ""Cars"" and ""Harry Potter"" still exist. The idea seems to be that since the children who are watching this have no cognitive skills to speak of there is no good reason to really try. It also has zero crossover appeal to other demographics. And that is OK and their prerogative, but while it may be en vogue to criticize Pixar for appealing to children of all ages at least their movies don't make me wish that I was sleeping. The story is really quite vanilla, a girl named Laura moves with her family to a new city. There, having no friends, she settles in for a life of loneliness. That is until a lucky star falls from the heavens and befriends Laura. This particular star is, predictably enough, about the size of a house cat and shaped the shape (five points and all). The star turns out to be the perfect friend for Laura, or the ideal friend that none of us ever had. It lifts her up when she is feeling blue and always has her back. And in a world of bullies and parental figures who yak on the phone too much this star is exactly what she needs in her life.The main problem here is that this filmmakes no attempt to be entertaining. Why not give the people in the audience something (anything) to chew on? Why not produce something that will challenge people at every stage of their life? Besides I can't imagine how this would be entertaining even to the tots that it is aimed at. Everything is soft and whimsical. Childhood is presented as something that must be revered. The only peril this film provides is when Laura has to race across town to deliver her mom's lucky instrument to her before her big recital. But having a lucky star on your side is a great tool to overcoming adversity, not that there is much to be found here. There are also no villains and no conflicts. So the filmmakers have filled 80 minutes with Laura floating around and above what I assume is Germany. The animation is kind of bad, and not in a retro kind of way. The closest comparison to this film I could think of was ""Spirited Away"" another movie I was not so fond of. They both involve annoying young girls who go on mystical journeys all in the name of learning life lessons. But ""Spirited Away"" had a much more active imagination and superior animation. It was the first time I had seen a German animation film, so I can at least take that away from it. In the end Laura learns the very healthy lesson that sometimes things go away and never come back. But considering how soft the rest of the film was I was left wondering if beating her over the head with this particular lesson was necessary. Yes, most people would consider being friends with a person a better idea than being friends with a star, but when you are preaching to the new born does any of this really matter. *1/2",1,Laura's Sleeping Pill,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,3093,"['Seeing', 'how', 'film', 'seem', 'aimed', 'children', 'aged', '1', 'year', 'have', 'apparently', 'arrived', 'scene', '24', 'years', 'too', 'late', 'So', 'everybody', 'else', 'who', 'took', 'journey', 'did', 'only', 'have', 'say', 'children', 'entertainment', 'was', 'always', 'bad', 'kid', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'watch', 'TV', 'Lucky', 'Cars', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'still', 'exist', 'idea', 'be', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'watching', 'have', 'cognitive', 'skills', 'speak', 'good', 'reason', 'really', 'try', 'also', 'zero', 'crossover', 'appeal', 'other', 'demographics', 'OK', 'prerogative', 'may', 'be', 'en', 'vogue', 'criticize', 'Pixar', 'appealing', 'children', 'ages', 'least', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'wish', 'was', 'sleeping', 'story', 'really', 'quite', 'vanilla', 'girl', 'named', 'Laura', 'family', 'new', 'city', 'having', 'friends', 'life', 'loneliness', 'lucky', 'star', 'heavens', 'befriends', 'Laura', 'particular', 'star', 'predictably', 'enough', 'size', 'house', 'cat', 'shaped', 'shape', 'five', 'points', 'star', 'out', 'be', 'perfect', 'friend', 'Laura', 'ideal', 'friend', 'none', 'ever', 'had', 'up', 'when', 'feeling', 'blue', 'always', 'back', 'world', 'bullies', 'parental', 'figures', 'who', 'yak', 'phone', 'too', 'much', 'star', 'exactly', 'what', 'life.The', 'main', 'problem', 'here', 'attempt', 'be', 'entertaining', 'Why', 'not', 'give', 'people', 'audience', 'something', 'anything', 'chew', 'Why', 'not', 'produce', 'something', 'will', 'challenge', 'people', 'stage', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'entertaining', 'even', 'tots', 'aimed', 'Everything', 'soft', 'whimsical', 'Childhood', 'presented', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'revered', 'only', 'peril', 'film', 'when', 'Laura', 'race', 'town', 'deliver', 'mom', 'lucky', 'instrument', 'big', 'recital', 'having', 'lucky', 'star', 'side', 'great', 'tool', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'not', 'much', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'villains', 'conflicts', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'filled', '80', 'minutes', 'Laura', 'floating', 'around', 'what', 'assume', 'Germany', 'animation', 'kind', 'bad', 'not', 'retro', 'kind', 'way', 'closest', 'comparison', 'film', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'fond', 'involve', 'annoying', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'go', 'mystical', 'journeys', 'name', 'learning', 'life', 'lessons', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'active', 'imagination', 'superior', 'animation', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'German', 'animation', 'film', 'can', 'least', 'take', 'away', 'end', 'Laura', 'very', 'healthy', 'lesson', 'sometimes', 'things', 'go', 'away', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'considering', 'how', 'soft', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'beating', 'head', 'particular', 'lesson', 'was', 'necessary', 'Yes', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'consider', 'being', 'friends', 'person', 'better', 'idea', 'being', 'friends', 'star', 'when', 'are', 'preaching', 'new', 'born', 'really', 'matter', '*1/2']",Laura's Star
996369,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000FUTVL4,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[4, 4]","""Laura's Star"" shines with stardust in three key areas:- Animation --- Very comforting animation style that combines both traditional animation and CGI elements. Soft pastel coloring that fits with the overall fantasy style of the film, but also lends a certain realness where needed. Expressive characters that translate well into many languages.- Music --- This film includes a charming musical track that includes ""The Magic Flute"" by Mozart, a pleasing score headed by Hans Zimmer (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - argh!) and catchy pop songs by a group called ""Wonderwall."" After watching this film, it makes me want to explore more of the works of Zimmer and Wonderwall as well --- a German group.- Overall Plot and Magic --- The main plot of ""Laura's Star"" is that a family moves out of the country into a new home in the city. The girl in the family, Laura, is having trouble adjusting to her new neighborhood. There are bullies to deal with and nothing is familiar. She really wants to go back to her old home, but then a little magic comes into her life --- a little star who she helps to heal and whose stardust has magical properties. Now she's off on magical adventures, but faces despair at times as well. Sure, the plot starts off a little slow at first. But I don't really mind that. I don't care either if there's not a huge amount of entertainment value or high drama. This film has a sweet charm and a rather relaxing quality at times, similar to something like ""Franklin"" or ""The Little Bear Movie"" and I wouldn't mind seeing a similar movie by the same filmmakers again.Oh --- and great dub. This film was originally voiced in German, but they've picked a wonderful cast for the English-language release.This DVD comes with a neat set of special features. You get commentary by the filmmakers about the production of the film, a look at the German voice recording and voice actors, background on the music and a music video of ""Touch the Sky"" and a look at the animation process. There are also a few reasonably decent games.Unfortunately, the special features were the one area where I felt a bit more effort could have been put in. You see, this is the U.S. / English language release, but the special features haven't been localized for U.S. audiences. So generally the cast and crew are heard speaking in German. I don't even really mind this. What I do mind is that in those cases where somebody actually was speaking in English, they have *somebody else* speaking over them in German! Couldn't they have removed that?""Laura's Star"" (""Lauras Stern"" if you prefer the German title) is a wonderful treat for animation fans and a Chicago Children's Festival award-winner. If you or your kids enjoy quality animation and are looking for something that's maybe a little different, don't pass this up.",5,And the Stars Will Be Your Guide...,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,2817,"['Laura', 'Star', 'shines', 'stardust', 'three', 'key', 'areas', 'Animation', 'Very', 'comforting', 'animation', 'style', 'traditional', 'animation', 'CGI', 'elements', 'Soft', 'pastel', 'coloring', 'overall', 'fantasy', 'style', 'film', 'also', 'certain', 'realness', 'where', 'needed', 'Expressive', 'characters', 'translate', 'well', 'many', 'languages.-', 'Music', 'film', 'charming', 'musical', 'track', 'Magic', 'Flute', 'Mozart', 'pleasing', 'score', 'headed', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'argh', 'catchy', 'pop', 'songs', 'group', 'called', 'Wonderwall', 'watching', 'film', 'want', 'explore', 'more', 'works', 'Zimmer', 'Wonderwall', 'as', 'well', 'German', 'group.-', 'Overall', 'Plot', 'Magic', 'main', 'plot', 'Laura', 'Star', 'family', 'country', 'new', 'home', 'city', 'girl', 'family', 'Laura', 'having', 'trouble', 'adjusting', 'new', 'neighborhood', 'are', 'bullies', 'deal', 'nothing', 'familiar', 'really', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'home', 'then', 'little', 'magic', 'life', 'little', 'star', 'who', 'heal', 'stardust', 'magical', 'properties', 'Now', 'off', 'magical', 'adventures', 'despair', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'Sure', 'plot', 'off', 'little', 'slow', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'either', 'not', 'huge', 'amount', 'entertainment', 'value', 'high', 'drama', 'film', 'sweet', 'charm', 'rather', 'relaxing', 'quality', 'times', 'similar', 'something', 'Franklin', 'Little', 'Bear', 'Movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'similar', 'movie', 'same', 'filmmakers', 'again.Oh', 'great', 'dub', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'voiced', 'German', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'English-language', 'release.This', 'DVD', 'neat', 'set', 'special', 'features', 'get', 'commentary', 'filmmakers', 'production', 'film', 'look', 'German', 'voice', 'recording', 'voice', 'actors', 'background', 'music', 'music', 'video', 'Touch', 'Sky', 'look', 'animation', 'process', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'reasonably', 'decent', 'games.Unfortunately', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'felt', 'bit', 'more', 'effort', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'see', 'U.S.', '/', 'English', 'language', 'release', 'special', 'features', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'localized', 'U.S.', 'audiences', 'So', 'generally', 'cast', 'crew', 'are', 'heard', 'speaking', 'German', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'mind', 'What', 'do', 'mind', 'cases', 'where', 'somebody', 'actually', 'was', 'speaking', 'English', 'have', '*somebody', 'else*', 'speaking', 'German', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'removed', 'Laura', 'Star', 'Lauras', 'Stern', 'prefer', 'German', 'title', 'wonderful', 'treat', 'animation', 'fans', 'Chicago', 'Children', 'Festival', 'award-winner', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'quality', 'animation', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'maybe', 'little', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up']",Laura's Star
