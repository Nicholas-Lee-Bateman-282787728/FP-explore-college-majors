508276,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00000JWWK,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Sparrows is a great Mary Pickford vehicle that keeps your attention throughout. The superb acting, the very well constructed sets, and the excellent cinematography all combine to create this motion picture masterpiece.The action begins on a ""baby farm"" run by the evil Mr. Grimes (Gustave von Seyffertitz) and his wife Mrs. Grimes (Charlotte Mineau). The Grimes use very young children to labor in their rundown fields planting and harvesting vegetables. The eldest child, Molly (Mary Pickford) works hard and also looks out for the rest of the children who seem several years younger than she. Mr. Grimes has no heart--he sends them to bed without supper after they spend all day toiling in his fields; and he rings a bell whenever visitors come so that the kids of the baby farm know to hide. Grimes doesn't want it known that it is he running the baby farm.Eventually, there is a new addition to the baby farm. Mr. Grimes gets the very young little girl of a wealthy family; her name is Doris Wayne (Mary Louise Miller). When Doris's father (Roy Stewart) finds out she's been kidnapped, he contacts the police and they quickly organize a manhunt for the men who kidnapped little Doris and took her to Grimes's baby farm.Meanwhile, Grimes want to bury the evidence--literally. He decides to throw little baby Doris in the quicksand of the nearby swamp so that the police can never find her and so that he will never be charged with any crime. When Molly hears of this she quickly concocts a plan for her and the smaller children to escape through the swamp, across a small creek filled with live alligators and eventually to safety and better homes.Of course the plot can go anywhere from here. As Mr. Grimes knows, escape is nearly impossible through the quicksand of the swamp. How will Molly guide the children through that? How will they avoid the alligators of the swamp? Will they be successful at escaping the baby farm? What will happen to Mr. and Mrs. Grimes if they do escape from the farm? Watch and find out!The choreography works well in scenes on the farm. Molly and the son of Mr. Grimes, Ambrose (Spec O'Donnell) fight it out once or twice and the choreography really enhances these scenes. The cinematography impresses me: They made it seem that Molly and the children really were very, very close to the live alligators. However, as one reviewer correctly notes, the alligators were filmed separately and the film was patched together to create the illusion that the alligators were very close.The DVD comes with two extras; both are shorts from 1910 when D. W. Griffith directed Mary Pickford in a number of films. On this DVD we get Wilful Peggy and The Mender of Nets. These two films let us see a rather young Mary Pickford already acting every bit of the pro that she always was. Great! The prints are in excellent condition for their age, too. Amazon notes above that there is a documentary with Whoopi Goldberg; but there was no such extra on the disc that I received.Overall, Sparrows is an excellent film starring the immortal Mary Pickford; her acting impresses me every step of the way. Look for a fine, convincing performance by Gustave von Seyffertitz as the evil Mr. Grimes; and Spec O'Donnell does a great job playing the son of Mr. and Mrs. Grimes as well.Enjoy!",5,fine Mary Pickford vehicle,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,3298,"['Sparrows', 'great', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'vehicle', 'attention', 'superb', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'constructed', 'sets', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'combine', 'create', 'motion', 'picture', 'masterpiece.The', 'action', 'baby', 'farm', 'run', 'evil', 'Mr.', 'Grimes', 'Gustave', 'von', 'Seyffertitz', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Grimes', 'Charlotte', 'Mineau', 'Grimes', 'use', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'labor', 'rundown', 'fields', 'planting', 'harvesting', 'vegetables', 'eldest', 'child', 'Molly', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'hard', 'also', 'out', 'rest', 'children', 'who', 'seem', 'several', 'years', 'younger', 'Mr.', 'Grimes', 'heart', 'bed', 'supper', 'spend', 'day', 'toiling', 'fields', 'bell', 'whenever', 'visitors', 'come', 'so', 'kids', 'baby', 'farm', 'know', 'hide', 'Grimes', ""n't"", 'want', 'known', 'running', 'baby', 'farm.Eventually', 'new', 'addition', 'baby', 'farm', 'Mr.', 'Grimes', 'very', 'young', 'little', 'girl', 'wealthy', 'family', 'name', 'Doris', 'Wayne', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Miller', 'When', 'Doris', 'father', 'Roy', 'Stewart', 'out', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'police', 'quickly', 'organize', 'manhunt', 'men', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'little', 'Doris', 'took', 'Grimes', 'baby', 'farm.Meanwhile', 'Grimes', 'want', 'bury', 'evidence', 'literally', 'throw', 'little', 'baby', 'Doris', 'quicksand', 'nearby', 'swamp', 'police', 'can', 'never', 'find', 'so', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'charged', 'crime', 'When', 'Molly', 'quickly', 'plan', 'smaller', 'children', 'escape', 'swamp', 'small', 'creek', 'filled', 'live', 'alligators', 'eventually', 'safety', 'better', 'homes.Of', 'course', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'Mr.', 'Grimes', 'escape', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'quicksand', 'swamp', 'How', 'will', 'Molly', 'guide', 'children', 'How', 'will', 'avoid', 'alligators', 'swamp', 'Will', 'be', 'successful', 'escaping', 'baby', 'farm', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Grimes', 'do', 'escape', 'farm', 'Watch', 'find', 'out', 'choreography', 'well', 'scenes', 'farm', 'Molly', 'son', 'Mr.', 'Grimes', 'Ambrose', 'Spec', ""O'Donnell"", 'fight', 'out', 'once', 'twice', 'choreography', 'really', 'scenes', 'cinematography', 'made', 'seem', 'Molly', 'children', 'really', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'live', 'alligators', 'However', 'one', 'reviewer', 'correctly', 'alligators', 'were', 'filmed', 'separately', 'film', 'was', 'patched', 'together', 'create', 'illusion', 'alligators', 'were', 'very', 'close.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'extras', 'are', 'shorts', '1910', 'when', 'D.', 'W.', 'Griffith', 'directed', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'number', 'films', 'DVD', 'get', 'Wilful', 'Peggy', 'Mender', 'Nets', 'two', 'films', 'let', 'see', 'rather', 'young', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'already', 'acting', 'bit', 'pro', 'always', 'was', 'Great', 'prints', 'are', 'excellent', 'condition', 'age', 'too', 'Amazon', 'notes', 'documentary', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'was', 'such', 'extra', 'disc', 'received.Overall', 'Sparrows', 'excellent', 'film', 'starring', 'immortal', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'acting', 'impresses', 'step', 'way', 'Look', 'fine', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Gustave', 'von', 'Seyffertitz', 'evil', 'Mr.', 'Grimes', 'Spec', ""O'Donnell"", 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'son', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Grimes', 'well.Enjoy']",Sparrows
508277,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,B00000JWWK,Mr Peter G George,"[8, 8]","The reason why Sparrows works so well as a film is that there is a genuine sense of threat. This is partly because the sets used for the film, although constructed on the Pickford-Fairbanks backlot, are remarkably convincing. The baby farm, where Mary Pickford and her group of orphans are held prisoner, looks old, rundown and dirty, while the swamp surrounding the farm looks fetid, diseased and fully of dangers. The quicksand, which was actually made from sawdust and cork ground up with water, seems ready to swallow up the unwary. The alligators guarding the swamp are real, but their apparent proximity to Pickford and the children is an illusion brought about through clever splicing of two separate images.The sense of menace which pervades the film also owes a great deal to the performance of Gustav von Seyffertitz as Grimes the owner of the farm. His limping gait means that he creeps everywhere, becoming a looming presence. His looks can be compared to those of Max Schreck in Nosferatu, but von Seyfferitz's performance is not that of a monster from a horror film. The threat that his acting suggests is more realistic than the threat of a nightmare.Sparrows is a film with a great deal of suspense mixed with some fine humour and emotion. Pickford, as usual, gives a sympathetic performance. She is feisty, resourceful and courageous.The black and white print used for this DVD is in very good condition. The only slight query I have is with regard to its length. Sparrows is often listed as being between 81 and 84 minutes in length, yet the print for the Milestone DVD runs 107 minutes. It could be that DVD print includes additional material, alternatively it could be that it runs slower than other prints.The DVD has as a bonus two Pickford Biograph shorts directed by D.W. Griffith.

508278,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00000JWWK,Only-A-Child,"[9, 9]","United Artists in the mid-1920's stood outside the motion picture industry's block booking system. It owned no theaters and did not have enough films to offer them in blocks. This meant each of the UA producers (Griffith, Fairbanks, Chaplin, and Pickford) had to finance each film individually; not an easy thing with the rising costs of producing long features. While Griffith was digging himself into a big hole (which would ultimately cost him his production company) making epic films and trying to top his early successes, Pickford prudently operated on a smaller scale. The irony being that she produced the type of folksy stuff that Griffith had once done so well and so profitably.""Sparrows"" was her last appearance playing a teenager and even though in her thirties she probably would have been physically believable in these roles for a couple more years. Most often described as ""Dickensian"" because of its gloomy feel and slightly off-kilter production design, ""Sparrows"" is the original ""Series of Unfortunate Events"". It is regarded as the least dated of her pictures (maybe of all silents), fitting because it does not seem at all dated. Even the humor seems contemporary with little Molly misquoting bible verses with stuff like: ""Let not thy right cheek know what thy left cheek is getting"".""Sparrows"" is also more perennially appealing than any silent film but it deals with a serious subject as baby farms are a historical fact and wealthy parents had reasons to fear kidnapping. The kidnapping in ""Sparrows"" has an eerie similarity to that of the Lindbergh baby, which would not take place until seven years ""after"" the film.The ""look"" of the film reflects the German expressionist style and should delight Lemony Snicket fans and anyone who gets off on creepy-strange beauty. Set designer Harry Oliver ""aged the tree stumps with blowtorches, and the entire picture has that netherworld quality of a slightly stylized environment that could only be created in a movie studio"". Watch for the early scene where the baby farm operator crushes the little doll and drops it into the quicksand where it slowly disappears.You also see a lot of Pickford's technique in Hal Roach's ""Little Rascals"". Check out the sequence when Little Splutters is leaving and his imprisoned friends are waving goodbye from inside the barn, by passing their hands through the slats. In fact Spec O'Donnell, who plays nasty stepson Ambrose, would later be a Roach regular. He is responsible for the film's first big laugh when he beans Molly with a turnip while she is trying to get the baby to stop crying. It is totally unexpected and even the baby finds it funny.Also of note is the dream sequence where Jesus comes to take the baby to heaven. Modern special effects could not improve on what they got using a simple matte exposure process. A similar technique worked so well with the swamp scenes that a legend grew up that Pickford and the children were actually at risk from the live alligators used in the scenes. Probably no silent managed a more genuinely suspenseful sequence that when they are crossing a rotting tree limb which is slowly cracking and dipping toward the water full of hungry alligators.Gustav von Seyffertitz does great as the evil Mr. Grimes (an early Snidley Whiplash) and is one of the best bad guys to come out of the silent era.Then again, what do I know?

508280,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B00000JWWK,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[0, 0]","Louise Brooks defied all odds in becoming the defining cult figure in early cinema, despite the fact that her brief stardom was as an American actress in European films. Although Brooks lacked initial recognition, she  was far more contemporary and provocative than established stars such as Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo, and Marlene Dietrich.Known as &#8220;America&#8217;s Sweetheart&#8221;, Mary Pickford was the female superstar of the silent era. She was huge box office, married the swashbuckling matin&eacute;e idol Douglas Fairbanks (theirs was the first Hollywood celebrity wedding) and together they built their famous mansion PickFair. Astutely, Pickford learned the business of filmmaking: editing, cinematography, lighting and production. She was the first woman to form her own production company and, later, with Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin, she built the mega studio United Artists. She was one of the founders of  the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. While politicos were battling over woman&#8217;s right to vote, Pickford&#8217;s voice was such an influential one that the Academy awarded her what was perhaps an undeserved Oscar for her first talking performance in the wretched Coquette (1929). Pickford and Fairbanks were Hollywood Royalty, wining and dining the famous, from Albert Einstein to H.G. Welles. Alas, royalty has its price. Coquette flopped at the box office. With the advent of sound the public wanted new faces, and because of their &#8220;royalty&#8221; status, Pickford and Fairbanks were seen as the old establishment. Although Pickford had an exceptionally fine voice, her career, along with that of her husband&#8217;s, came to an end. Still, even in reclusive retirement, Mary Pickford was treated as a pioneering queen of Hollywood, receiving numerous accolades  and tributes while the outsider Louise Brooks went through winters of extreme poverty. Today, Mary Pickford is virtually forgotten and Brooks is remembered. There are plenty of reasons for this.Pickford&#8217;s virginal child persona dates her. The bulk of her films are heart-on-sleeve rudimentary melodramas, soaked in so much religiosity that they make saccharine contemporary fare like &#8220;7th Heaven&#8221; or &#8220;Highway to Heaven&#8221; look like cutting edge dramas. Pickford herself doubted the value of her films after she retired, and left instructions for her work to be destroyed. Thankfully, this wish was not carried out (although her films were kept out of circulation until the DVD age). Despite the Victorian halo, Pickford&#8217;s screen persona is a curiously bewitching one, due to its archaic, ethereal nature coupled with an irresistibly delicate feistiness. Her mastery of comedy and drama in the pantomime form, her finger on the pulse of Americana, and her thematic sympathy for the less affluent adds to her appeal.Sparrows (1926) was Pickford&#8217;s last role in her child persona. It&#8217;s also her most compelling film. The religiosity is there, but it is so audacious as to be startling. Amazingly, William Beaudine directed. Beaudine later became known as &#8220;One-Shot Beaudine&#8221; because of his penchant for shooting single takes in poverty row programmers. Although he was one of Hollywood&#8217;s most prolific directors, with over 400 films to his credit, the bulk of these were &#8220;penny dreadfuls.&#8221; For all the sympathy fans have for Bela Lugosi suffering under an amateur Ed Wood, poor Bela was not a stranger to slumming it in One-Shot films like Ape Man (1943-Lugosi&#8217;s most embarrassing project), Ghosts on the Loose (1943), and Voodoo Man (1944).Beaudine&#8217;s presence makes Sparrows all the more surprising. Pickford and Beaudine had worked together previously in Little Annie Roonie (1925), which was an unremarkable box office hit (it had returned Pickford to her irascible waif persona after several failed attempts to play an adult). Sparrows was produced by Pickford, photographed by her favorite cinematographer Charles Rosher, and written by C. Gardner Sullivan (Hell&#8217;s Hinges, Tumbleweed, Sadie Thompson, All Quiet On the Western Front), all of which may explain the film&#8217;s being an exception to the general Beaudine rule. However, Sparrows would be Pickford and Beaudine&#8217;s final collaboration. The star vowed never to work with Beaudine again after his supposed bad treatment of the children in the cast. Beaudine vehemently denied Pickford&#8217;s allegations, claiming she fabricated them for the sake of publicity. Beaudine&#8217;s defense is backed by others&#8217; recollections. More than likely, Pickford and Beaudine clashed over artistic control. Art Director Harry Oliver created the stylish swamp, which was merely a few acres on a backlot. Alligators, with wired jaws, were brought in for &#8220;dramatic effect.&#8221;In this Dickensian Gothic melodrama, Pickford plays Molly, the oldest of a group of orphans being used for slave labor on a potato farm. Despite being about twenty years too old for the part (!), Pickford pulls it off with plucky perfection. The potato farm is actually a baby farm, with Molly as the self-appointed mother of the brood. Every melodrama needs a good villain. Sparrows has a superb one in Gustav von Seyffertitz as the aptly named hunchbacked baby thief, Grimes. Seyffertitz was a favorite silent era villain and his portrayal here is saturated in mire. When his racket is threatened with exposure, Grimes has no qualms about &#8220;chucking them babies in the swamp.&#8221; News of Grimes&#8217; plan reaches Molly. A chilling, breath-taking chase scene follows, which probably influenced Charles Laughton&#8217;s Night of the Hunter (1955). Molly leads her charges through the bayou, facing gators and quicksand. There is an early casualty amongst the children and none other than Jesus Christ Himself appears to escort the poor lad&#8217;s corpse into heaven!Sparrows is a model of art direction. Every detail counts. It was hailed as a masterpiece by Ernst Lubitsch (who called it one of the eight wonders of the world) and Chaplin (who typically hated Pickford&#8217;s films).
