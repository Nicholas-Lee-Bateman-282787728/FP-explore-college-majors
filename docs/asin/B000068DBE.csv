It is one of the best family movies to sit down and see because of the inspiration and people could relate it to their lives. The movie is about a man in his late 30's and his team wants him to pursue a chance to pitch in the majors. At first he is not sure what to do but in the end he gives it a shot. While some people might think this movie is unrealistic a pitcher on the Phillies two years ago was 34 when he made his debuted. The movie does have a lot of emotional moments as you end up rooting for them to succeed. After going through the minor leagues and so many struggles he discovers his dream and gets his chance to pitch in the majors. It truly is an inspiration to anyone and says if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything that you want. 5 Star movie in my opinion.,5,The Rookie DVD Is a 5 Star DVD,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,884,"['rookie', 'one', 'inspirational', 'movies', 'are', 'hard', 'forget', 'once', 'watch', 'one', 'best', 'family', 'movies', 'sit', 'down', 'see', 'inspiration', 'people', 'could', 'relate', 'lives', 'movie', 'man', 'late', '30', 'team', 'pursue', 'chance', 'pitch', 'majors', 'first', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'end', 'shot', 'people', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'unrealistic', 'pitcher', 'Phillies', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'was', '34', 'when', 'made', 'debuted', 'movie', 'have', 'lot', 'emotional', 'moments', 'end', 'up', 'rooting', 'succeed', 'going', 'minor', 'leagues', 'so', 'many', 'struggles', 'dream', 'chance', 'pitch', 'majors', 'truly', 'inspiration', 'anyone', 'put', 'mind', 'can', 'accomplish', 'anything', 'want', '5', 'Star', 'movie', 'opinion']",The Rookie

This is another wholesome film from Disney that teaches kids not to be afraid to dream a dream and -- with any luck and a lot of support from friends and family -- to try to live that dream.  Sometimes, life throws you curveballs that prevent you from pursuing that dream, but it doesn't mean that it's impossible.  It just means you have to adjust your swing to hit it.  In the film, Dennis Quaid has a dream to make it to the big leagues again (after an accident that left him injured when he was younger).  But without the support and help of the high school team he coaches, his supportive wife and children, it would've been impossible.To me, it also reinforced the idea that if you care about others and treat them with respect, they cannot help but feel the need to reciprocate.

Viewers can connect with this. I also liked that Quaid did not play Morris as a man whose life would be incomplete if he did not have one more shot at success.

Count your blessings as this one's a true story with regular, live-action people in it. I open with that because I'm thinking maybe the cynics who are still attacking the sentimental edge of this film aren't fully realizing that the film hasn't been ""Disneyfied"" in any way. It *is* a family friendly autobiography about an adult who gets the proverbial break. But how much tunnel vision have we adapted in this country in regard to family films? ""Rookie's"" director John Lee Hancock even comments (on the DVD) on the enigmatic reaction he got when his film had to be rated by the MPAA. No one was more surprised than he that they gave it a G rating, considering that it includes, among other things, father-son dysfunction and a spotlight on an adult character rather than a talking dog or alien.

Football is the sport of choice in those parts of Texas, where he lived, so the baseball team has to play on a substandard field with second hand equipment.  He used to be a minor league pitcher with potential, but had to quit due to numerous injuries and a fastball that just wasn't very fast, only in the mid 80 mile per hour range (below average for major league pitchers)However, when he starts pitching batting practice for his team, he somehow has the ability to throw in the mid to upper 90 mile per hour range.  He has no idea, of course that the pitches are so fast.  He tells the kids that they are not really that fast and that it just seems faster.  The players on the team get used to batting practice against major league fastballs and as a result are able to hit high school pitching easily.Success has not come easily to this bunch, and after a particularly tough loss, he rallies the team to tell them they can do whatever they want if they only dare to dream.  They respond that he should do the same--that he should try out for a major league team.  He makes a deal with them.  If they win the district championship, he will find an open tryout with some team and show what he can do.  They win, of course, and he goes for the tryout.  This starts a chain of events which eventually leads him to a pitcher's mound in Arlington, Tx and a major league game against the Rangers.What makes the movie so great is the warmth of the characters and the story.  The story is wonderful, especially because it's basically 100% true.  But Dennis Quaid is great as Jim Morris.  He is believable as a small town teacher who realizes just how lucky he is.  Rachel Griffiths does very well as his wife who has to support him through the low times on the way up the ladder.  The DVD is a nice package.  There are some very good deleted scenes which really round out the story nicely and a 20 minute documentary piece featuring the real Jim Morris who shows exactly what happened when he made his debut on that September night.Finally, because this is a G rated movie, it will be a favorite among all members of the family.  It is just one of those stories which comes around every few decades.  You don't have to be a sports fan to love the story of the underdog coming out on top.  Jim Morris is the ultimate underdog.

Morrison had wanted to pitch in the major leagues since he was a boy.  But he blew out his shoulder in the minor leagues, which brought an end to his dream.  So Morrison went off to college and ended up teaching at his alma mater in west Texas, where he also coaches the baseball team.  Now approaching middle age with a wife and three children, he seems like the least likely candidate for a shot at a baseball career.  But he goes for it anyway.This is a heart-warming, family-friendly movie.  Dennis Quaid brings a likeable, everyman quality to the Morrison character.  Rachel Griffiths' performance is equally strong as Lorri Morrison--she is perfectly convincing as a Texan (Griffiths is actually Australian).  The casting director also found some cute kids to play the Morrison children, especially a very young Angus Jones, who plays the oldest.  In the cynical world in which we live, critics might complain that this movie is a bit saccharine.  Well, it is, in a Disney kind of way.  But that's okay.  It is wholesome entertainment for the whole family.The quality of the blu-ray transfer is excellent.  Crisp details; good colors; great sound.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.Parental Advisory.  This movie is rated G.  There are a couple of instances of mild language.  In two scenes, characters are seen sipping a beer (but no drunkenness).  In another scene, a married couple is talking in bed.  Her shoulders are bare, but there is no nudity or sexuality.

THE ROOKIE is the true story of an aging, small-town Texas high baseball coach and science teacher names Jim Morris who just happened to have a faster draw than Glenn Ford.  (If you're too young to know who Glenn Ford is then you might need to research the ""Westerns"" section.)This film is uniquely told with a short prologue that is so unique and creative, that no sports movie director would ever have come up with such a thing.  The film opens and progresses showing the continuous nature of American life through the eyes of a young boy whose dreams are bigger than his feet can carry him.  But not too late in life, his dream and childhood passion is fully realized and the reward for him is timeless, just as the reward for us results an unforgettable and inspiring movie watching.I might add that this movie is clean family viewing.  You can watch it with you pastor's grandmother in the room and not have to be embarrassed about anything.

A high school science teacher who also coaches the school's baseball team, the Owls, in Big Lake, Texas. Jim has long ago abandoned his dream of playing in the big leagues after a shoulder injury diminished his chances. Now with a wife and three children, Jim watches as his high school team faces a losing streak with no end in sight. His offer? If the team comes together and wins the district championship, he will try out for a major league team. The team, sensing an opportunity to witness the dormant greatness in Jim, gets their act together and soon wins seventeen games. Thrilled with their accomplishment, Jim is now forced to confront his promise.The Rookie, which won best sports film at the 2002 ESPY Awards, is an admirable, inspiring, amusing and charming movie.

Coming from the makers of ""Remember the Titans,"" and embracing the Disney formula of virtue with every fiber of its being, the film is completely by-the-book, though this sense of familiarity puts one right at home with the material rather than inviting one's cynicism.The story begins with a basic prologue that serves to set up the fairy tale quality of the movie, which then segues into the life story of Jim Morris, professional baseball player who, as a young boy, dreamed of one day becoming a member of a Major League team. His father, whose work with the military takes his family from Connecticut to Virginia to Florida, and finally Texas, dismisses his son's childhood fantasies. This distanced relationship, as you may have guessed, will come into play later in the film, once Jim's boyhood dreams come true.But I'm getting ahead of myself here. The film advances to present day, where we see Jim as a high school science teacher and baseball coach in the town of Big Lake, Texas. The school's baseball team, a rag-tag bunch who become inspired when they discover that their coach can throw a baseball at speeds in excess of 90 miles per hour, strike a deal with Jim: if they can get their act together and win the district championship, then he will reward them by trying out for the minors once again.Yes, the team wins the championship game. Yes, Jim does try out, and finally gets his second chance at playing professional baseball. The movie tosses in some normal elements, such as a nagging subplot involving a job offer at Fort Worth, an injured arm that threatens to overpower Jim, and the family angle, centering on his wife Lorrie's concern for his physical, and emotional, well-being.As a human drama, ""The Rookie"" is strictly by-the-book. The film's increasingly abundant emotional elements are easily foreseen ahead of time, but they hold true to the formula of self-realization and life achievement. It takes the usual expected twists and turns, finding a comfort zone in its ability to make old plot devices seem fresh and inviting. By the film's ending, I was pleased by the fact that the central message, the old ""follow your dreams"" lesson, was allowed to gently work its way into the audience, rather than being shoved down our throats at the last minute.In the film's highest favor are its director and characters, who we come to care for as human beings instead of mere lessons on life. John Lee Hancock keeps the film moving at a brisk pace, masking his 129-minute running time with the upbeat feel of his story, and the charisma of the people in it. Dennis Quaid is quite the charmer as Jim Morris, balancing his character's paternal nature and boyhood dreams in a convincing and pleasing manner. There are deep connections established between he and his family, his baseball team, and the townsfolk, those which are make the film's inspirational and uplifting morals ring true.As I watched the film grow increasingly predictable (and likeable), I was increasingly in awe of its ability to deliver its story in a manner that makes it one of the most pleasing film experiences I've had all year. Normally, I would wonder about a movie that wears its heart on its sleeve, but ""The Rookie"" is that unique home run of a movie that provides entertainment so light-hearted and joyous, that all reservations about its execution are tossed to the dugout.",5,One of the most pleasing film experiences I've had all year.,1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,3551,"['Family', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'Rookie', 'well-crafted', 'nicely', 'photographed', 'terrifically', 'enjoyable', 'drama', 'life', 'lessons', 'moral', 'values', 'Coming', 'makers', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'embracing', 'Disney', 'formula', 'virtue', 'fiber', 'being', 'film', 'completely', 'by-the-book', 'sense', 'familiarity', 'puts', 'one', 'right', 'home', 'material', 'rather', 'inviting', 'one', 'cynicism.The', 'story', 'basic', 'prologue', 'set', 'up', 'fairy', 'tale', 'quality', 'movie', 'then', 'life', 'story', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'professional', 'baseball', 'player', 'who', 'young', 'boy', 'dreamed', 'one', 'day', 'becoming', 'member', 'Major', 'League', 'team', 'father', 'work', 'military', 'family', 'Connecticut', 'Virginia', 'Florida', 'finally', 'Texas', 'son', 'childhood', 'fantasies', 'distanced', 'relationship', 'may', 'have', 'guessed', 'will', 'come', 'play', 'later', 'film', 'once', 'Jim', 'boyhood', 'come', 'true.But', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'here', 'film', 'advances', 'present', 'day', 'where', 'see', 'Jim', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'baseball', 'coach', 'town', 'Big', 'Lake', 'Texas', 'school', 'baseball', 'team', 'rag-tag', 'bunch', 'who', 'become', 'inspired', 'when', 'discover', 'coach', 'can', 'throw', 'baseball', 'speeds', 'excess', '90', 'miles', 'hour', 'strike', 'deal', 'Jim', 'can', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'win', 'district', 'championship', 'then', 'will', 'reward', 'trying', 'out', 'minors', 'once', 'again.Yes', 'team', 'championship', 'game', 'Yes', 'Jim', 'try', 'out', 'finally', 'second', 'chance', 'playing', 'professional', 'baseball', 'movie', 'normal', 'elements', 'such', 'nagging', 'subplot', 'involving', 'job', 'offer', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'injured', 'arm', 'overpower', 'Jim', 'family', 'angle', 'centering', 'wife', 'Lorrie', 'concern', 'physical', 'emotional', 'well-being.As', 'human', 'drama', 'Rookie', 'strictly', 'by-the-book', 'film', 'increasingly', 'abundant', 'emotional', 'elements', 'are', 'easily', 'foreseen', 'ahead', 'time', 'hold', 'true', 'formula', 'self-realization', 'life', 'achievement', 'usual', 'expected', 'twists', 'turns', 'finding', 'comfort', 'zone', 'ability', 'make', 'old', 'plot', 'devices', 'seem', 'fresh', 'inviting', 'film', 'ending', 'was', 'pleased', 'fact', 'central', 'message', 'old', 'follow', 'dreams', 'lesson', 'was', 'allowed', 'gently', 'work', 'way', 'audience', 'rather', 'being', 'shoved', 'down', 'throats', 'last', 'minute.In', 'film', 'highest', 'favor', 'are', 'director', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'care', 'human', 'beings', 'instead', 'mere', 'lessons', 'life', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'film', 'moving', 'brisk', 'pace', 'masking', '129-minute', 'running', 'time', 'upbeat', 'feel', 'story', 'charisma', 'people', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'quite', 'charmer', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'balancing', 'character', 'paternal', 'nature', 'boyhood', 'dreams', 'convincing', 'pleasing', 'manner', 'are', 'deep', 'connections', 'established', 'family', 'baseball', 'team', 'townsfolk', 'are', 'make', 'film', 'inspirational', 'uplifting', 'morals', 'ring', 'true.As', 'watched', 'film', 'grow', 'increasingly', 'predictable', 'likeable', 'was', 'increasingly', 'awe', 'ability', 'deliver', 'story', 'manner', 'one', 'most', 'pleasing', 'film', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'had', 'year', 'Normally', 'would', 'wonder', 'movie', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'Rookie', 'unique', 'home', 'run', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'so', 'light-hearted', 'joyous', 'reservations', 'execution', 'are', 'tossed', 'dugout']",The Rookie

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","As an avid baseball fan (maybe too avid) I was somewhat familiar with the Jim Morris story; I even watched him close a few games, and the guy could bring the heat.  But when his story was told in the film THE ROOKIE I stayed away.  Because it was a Disney movie, and because of its G-rating, I was concerned this portrayal would be more bubble gum than can of corn; but when Cal Ripken, a Hall of Fame icon, heartily endorsed THE ROOKIE, I knew I had to check it out.And I was not disappointed.Once a promising young talent whose professional career was cut short by injuries and heartache, Jim Morris is a thirtysomething chemistry teacher/baseball coach with three young kids and a mortgage in a dusty west Texas town.  His high school players lack drive and desire--but they do know their coach can throw one mean fastball.  He challenges them to put it all on the line--they make him promise them if they win district he'll try out for a major league team.  The rest, as they say, is history, and Morris's journey from podunk to palace is a delightful and inspirational ride--culminating in his major league debut at The Ballpark in Arlington, Texas (a scene that will put a guaranteed lump in your throat).Dennis Quaid does an admirable job portraying Morris; he captures the pitcher's determination and ""Aw, shucks"" humility at the same time.  There's a very interesting backstory featuring decades of conflict between Morris and his hard-to-please father (Brian Cox); the resolution of this conflict is yet another poignant scene.  Granted, it is Disney, and the teenagers on the high school baseball team are definitely watered down, yet THE ROOKIE is a feel-good movie for all to enjoy.--D.

Which American boy has never dreamed of pitching in the 7th game of the World Series? Not very many you can bet.This movie brings a real-life story to the Big Screen about Jim Morris (played by Dennis Quaid), a young Texan-boy who was obsessed with baseball as a young boy. During his childhood he moved nearly half a dozen times before finding a home in Big Lake, Texas, but when they moved Jim's father (played by Brain Cox) forgets to bring along his glove and baseball socks which were left in Florida. As the years go by Jim pitches through the rain, snow, wind and rain while trying to fulfill his Major League dream. He gets his chance after being drafted after one year of college in 1980. Jim's dream failed after he retired after spending nearly 10 years in the Minor Leagues. Then Jim becomes a chemistry teacher and a baseball coach at the local High School in Big Lake. The baseball team, the Owls had struggled in the last 3 seasons winning a total of 3 games and had lost their first two games of the season by being blown-out by several runs. For motivation Morris agrees to try out for a big-league team if his team wins the District championship and makes it to State. Then they start winning.....17 in a row to win the District Championship. Jim keeps his part of the deal and tries out for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Jim threw a dozen pitches in a row 98 miles per hour. The scout called the Devil Rays and they couldn't believe a man of his age could throw so fast. Finally Morris made it to the Majors. His first game would be in Arlington, Texas against the Rangers. Morris was brought into the game after Tampa fell behind by several runs in the middle innings. Jim strikes out his first batter he ever faced.. Jim went on to pitch 2 more years in the Majors.The only problem of this movie is you can tell the  fuzzy feeling of Disney movies is in there. I doubt that in reality Morris' wife supported him to try to make the Majors while she had to take care of 3 young children alone while the family's income plummeted.The Morale of this movie is believe in yourself because anything can happen.This is a must-see movie for any baseball fan.

704392,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000068DBE,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 6]","As someone who loves films and baseball, this film was a mixed bag for me.  As a human interest story it is excellent, but as a baseball story it is somewhat of a disappointment.  It is a very upbeat tale of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a high school science teacher who rediscovers his fastball at the age of 35 and tries out for the major leagues.  The story mixes together his personal quest and that of the high school baseball team he coaches, both of which overcome incredible odds to achieve near impossible feats.As a baseball story, Jim Morris is really nothing more than an interesting footnote in baseball history.  There are far more compelling baseball stories to be told, like Tommy John who came back from reconstructive surgery to pitch another 14 seasons (that were some of his best), or Jim Abbott who was born without a right hand and pitched in the major leagues for ten years, pitching a no hitter against Cleveland in 1993.  Morris only played for Tampa Bay for parts of two seasons, pitching a total of 15 innings with a 4.80 ERA and almost as many walks as strikeouts.  Still, it is pretty inspirational that he made it to the majors at all given his age.This film plays well on Main Street, where regular folks are reminded of the faded fantasies of their youth.  It strikes a chord because to root for Morris is to root for their long abandoned dreams.  Director John Lee Hancock does a fine job of bringing out the best in the human story, although the sports components are marginal.There are just too many instances of unrealistic baseball in this film.  For instance, Morris is repeatedly shown throwing as hard as he can with absolutely no warm-up.  Any little leaguer can tell you that you will blow out your arm if you do that.  This is especially unrealistic given the fact that Morris had surgery on that shoulder when he was younger.  Unless he was plain stupid, he would warm up before he attempted to throw flat out.As an athlete, Quaid is not terribly convincing, with pitching mechanics that are far short of professional caliber.  Kevin Costner was much more credible in ""For Love of the Game"", though that film lacked the story of this one.From an acting perspective Dennis Quaid is marvelous in the lead.  This is one of the best performances of his career.  He is convincing as the high school coach pushing his kids to reach for their dreams and maximize their potential.  His chemistry with the young cast is terrific.  However, in the pursuit of his own dream, he is even better.  This is a complex and nuanced performance showing Morris as filled with desire and self doubt.  Quaid's portrayal of his determination in the face of his own insecurity is phenomenally insightful and compelling.  Rachel Griffiths and Brian Cox give splendid performances and Morris' wife and father.This is a wonderful feel-good film that is great for the whole family.  I've been a little hard on it because I'm a long time baseball fanatic, but the human interest story is so well done and Quaid's performance so compelling that I have to give it at least an 8/10.

Dennis Quaid plays Jimmy Morris, who is a high school science teacher who once had a dream of playing baseball. The movie begins with Jimmy being a young boy who moves several times and has a somewhat instable relationship with his father. His father's belief is that sometimes people must do what they have to do to in life, not want what they want to do. While Jimmy believes this, he wants much more out of his childhood and he later gets a chance and trying to live his dream.We flash forward to many years later, and Jimmy is coaching a high school baseball team that needs motivation. After a lackluster defeat, the team challenges him to pursue his dream of trying out for the majors, and make a pact with him that if they can win the district, then he has to at least try out for minor league baseball.The great aspect of this film is that is goes much deeper than just being a film about baseball. It delves into what makes us want to pursue our dreams, and the notion that sometimes in life we have a chance to realize an opportunity if there is something or someone to push us in that direction.Because this is a G rated movie, it is appropriate for everyone.

For one, it has to be the most boring movie I've ever had the displeasure to waiste over 2 hours of my life on(and I'll never get those two hours of my life back, either!). I knew enough about this movie just knowing that an older guy pitched in the majors for two years! There, now you know all you need to know, too. Everything else in this movie in just absolute NONESENSE and NOT at all important to the story. Which seemed to drag on, on and on! Dennis Quaid was okay, but I can't figure out why his character never seemed happy about all the doors that are opening up for him. He never said thank you to anyone, in fact, he almost seemed ungrateful and like he just didn't care! His wife and son also seemed to almost not give a care, too! He finally makes it to the majors and his son says, ""I don't believe it"". I expected his son to say, ""I knew you could do it"" instead the kid acted like he just didn't care. With all of their bad acting and stupid one liners it just made me NOT CARE, too! Oh, can we talk about stupid. Every time he threw the ball there was this rediculous special effect dubbed in to make it sound like the ball was going at some kind of a ""SUPERSONIC"" speed. GIVE ME A BIG-FAT STICKING BREAK. ""Stupid is, is stupid does!"" and the highschool kids he coached...give me another break! Disney expects me to believe the kids would speak and care about the coach the way these kids did? Kids these days are so self-centered, there's no way their dialog is believable. One kid said it all when he said, ""Non of us are getting a scholarship, so what's the point"". That was believable, in fact, that was the most believable line in the whole movie. These kids just wouldn't have given a care about this coach like this movie portays. Now, I believe this older guy made it to the majors(facts are facts), I just don't believe the dialog happened the way it is portrayed in this SuperSNOOZER of a movie. If that is the way it happened, Disney did a lousey job recreating it. I'd give this movie a ""0"" if I could, but I can't, so I'll just urge you NOT to waiste your valuable time. Hey, I like ""FEEL GOOD"" movies, I'm just not sure why I'm suppose to ""feel good"" watching this one. To know that an older man pitched in the majors for two seasons(Oh...and he pitched for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays), is really all you need to know. For a ""True Story"" this movie is pointless. It never grabbed me and it never made me feel like I should even care! To say it was very dissapointing would be an understatement.There is so many interesting things that happen in real life, everyday, I can't believe they waisted all that money and time on this lackluster story! Now, go do something that is interesting and worth your time! In fact, starring at the wall or coloring in a Teletubbies coloring book with Krayola Crayons would be more interesting than this BOREFEST called a movie! Have I made myself clear?

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 4]","Jim Morris's father (to Jim): ""It's okay to think about what you want to do until it was time to start doing what you were meant to do.""THE ROOKIE tells the inspirational true story of pitcher Jim Morris, who in 1999 finally made it to major league baseball at the ripe old age of 35. Morris might've only stuck around in the big leagues for 2 years (injuries cropped up), but, give this underdog tremendous props, he was able to realize his life-long dream. Now, to me, THE ROOKIE seems more of a family flick (with some baseball thrown in) rather than specifically a sports movie. Not that it matters. Family flick, sports movie. Listen, it's a must see picture.SPOILERS alert.The plot now: Ever since he was a very young boy Jim Morris has loved baseball. Even as his father's military job kept the family constantly on the move, he never lost his passion for the game. At last finding stability in the dusty little oiling town of Big Lake, West Texas, Jim grows up and gets a chance at the minor league, only to succumb to debilitating injuries and forced to give up the sport. For most folks, that'll be the end of the story. Not for Jim Morris.Cut to many years later. Jim is now a family man, with a loving wife and three wonderful kids. He's a high school science teacher and coach of the high school baseball team, which has only won one game each for the last two seasons. Most times Jim still likes to throw the baseball. Unfathomably he finds himself throwing harder than ever, now throwing heat up to the high 90's, a fact which doesn't go unnoticed by his high school baseball team. The story's turning point comes when, after a particularly lousy game by his high school kids, Jim makes a deal with them. Should they reach the state playoffs, Jim'll try out again for the majors. Well, they do. So he does.SPOILERS end.THE ROOKIE may be based on a true story, but, in its warm spirit and longshot underdog-ity, there's almost an element of fantasy here, of a wish realized and a dream achieved. In a way, it reminds me ofField of Dreams (Widescreen Two-Disc Anniversary Edition). Inspirational? Absolutely. Heartwarming. Most definitely. I have nothing negative to say about this film. It teaches lessons in perseverance and sacrifice and faith in family and in yourself. Sure, some of the scenes are contrived, but, guess what, these moments still brought a lump to my throat.The cast is very good, with a particular nod to Dennis Quaid, who is excellent and warm and keeps the fairy tale aspects mostly grounded. And, y'know, Dennis still has his go-to saucy big grin and his easy charisma. Jim's father tells him: ""It's okay to think about what you want to do until it was time to start doing what you were meant to do.""

One was that it took his experiences as a coach at two High Schools, and made it just one High School.  The other is a scene where he throws a ball past a radar detector, to demonstrate his speed and his lack of knowledge of that speed.

Dennis Quaid stars as Jimmy Morris, a high school science teacher who is blessed with a 98 mph fastball.  Jimmy has always loved baseball, but his father was in the military so the family was forced to move around a lot.  Jimmy found it hard to make friends, but he maintained his pitching arm by practicing against a chain link fence.Years go by, and Jimmy has accepted a job as a science teacher at the local high school, as well as becoming the baseball coach.  The team hasn't been too scucesful recently, but Jimmy is determined to turn them into winners.  A bet is made between the players and Jimmy; If the team advances to the state tournament, Jimmy will go to a tryout with a major league team.  To Jimmy's surprise, the team holds up their end of the bargain.  Jimmy goes to a tryout with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and shows them he can still ""bring the heat"".A few days later, he receives a call from the Devil Rays' minor league team wanting him to sign.  After discussing things with his wife Lorri (Rachel Griffiths), Jimmy joins the team.  His success continues in the minors, and its not long before he gets called up to the big club.  As fate would have it, Jimmy's first game is in Arlington, Texas against the Texas Rangers.  Many of Jimmy's family and friends are at the game, and he gets in to face one batter, who faces the wrath of Jimmy's fastball.I'm a huge baseball movie fan, and this rates as one of the best I've seen.  Dennis Quaid actually took lessons from major league pitching coaches in preparation for this role, so his pitching form and delivery are very realistic.

I&#65533;ve seen that movie before. This time, it is a true story, and that makes all the difference. Jimmy Morris was a high school teacher in Texas, and he also coached the baseball team. Years ago, Morris was drafted by the Brewers, but his pitching arm gave out and he had to let go of his dream. His baseball team has won one game for each of the past 3 years. They lost their first two games of this season. Normally when Morris throws batting practice, he only lobs the ball in there so as to not damage his arm any more. The team&#65533;s catcher convinced Morris to throw a couple hard. He does, and it looked good to the team. The team makes a deal with Morris, if they win the District Championship he has to go to a Major League tryout. They do and he does. He is throwing 97-98 Miles Per Hour, faster than when he was drafted by the Brewers. The feel good story is that Morris actually makes it to play for the Devil Rays for two seasons, as a 38 year old rookie. We all know that he&#65533;ll make it, but the beauty of this movie is in watching it unfold.The Rookie could easily have been a 90 minute movie with the focus on the high school team winning the games for the coach and in the quest to make it back in baseball. Instead, Disney does something surprising with this one. The movie clocks in over 2 hours and is a comfortably paced movie. We get to have a feel for who Jimmy Morris is, and what baseball truly meant to him. We see the family dynamic and how it is affected by the life of a ballplayer on the road. Surprisingly, we also get to watch more of Morris pitching in the minor leagues. That aspect could easily have been glossed over, but it wasn&#65533;t.Dennis Quaid as Jimmy Morris is perfect casting.

He won't make it to Cooperstown.  What he did do, and this is the most important thing, is take a second chance on a dream.""The Rookie"" tells the story of Morris growing up as a military brat, being dragged across the country wherever it needed his father to be.  His dream was to pitch in the big leagues, but injuries, and perhaps a little bad luck, cut his career in the majors short.  He ended up in a little hole-in-the-wall town in Texas(don't all great baseball stories involve a small town?).  He became a teacher and coached the less-than-spectacular high school baseball team.When the team's catcher asks Morris to pitch to him, Morris starts to realize that whatever cut his dreams short so many years ago is now gone.  With a little coaxing(and a wager with his team), Morris tries out at Angelo State for the Bigs.  He makes it.  The story then follows the ups and downs of being a minor leaguer.  Eventually, though, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays call him up and he is asked to meet the team at The Ballpark in Arlington, home of the Texas Rangers.  There, he fulfills his dream of making it, and the story continues from there.What makes this story so great is that it has a wonderful message of never giving up set in actual events.  The cinematography of this film accurately captures the emotions that run roughshod over Morris as he attempts to make it to the Show.  My favorite sequence is when he makes it to Arlington and walks up to the ballpark.  If you've ever been to a Rangers game, you know how massive and imposing the Ballpark in Arlington can be.  Imagine walking up to it and knowing you might pitch there that night.  Though Arlington may not have the great history of Yankee Stadium or Fenway, its sheer size is a fearsome thing to experience.  The camera captures this imposing force perfectly.Overall, a great family-oriented film that will not let you down.Highly recommended.",5,One Of The Best Baseball Stories Around,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,2011,"['Jim', 'Morris', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'World', 'Series', ""n't"", 'hold', 'great', 'records', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'Cooperstown', 'What', 'did', 'do', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'take', 'second', 'chance', 'dream', 'Rookie', 'story', 'Morris', 'growing', 'up', 'military', 'brat', 'being', 'dragged', 'country', 'wherever', 'needed', 'father', 'be', 'dream', 'was', 'pitch', 'big', 'leagues', 'injuries', 'perhaps', 'little', 'bad', 'luck', 'cut', 'career', 'majors', 'short', 'ended', 'up', 'little', 'hole-in-the-wall', 'town', 'Texas', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'great', 'baseball', 'stories', 'involve', 'small', 'town', 'became', 'teacher', 'coached', 'less-than-spectacular', 'high', 'school', 'baseball', 'team', 'catcher', 'Morris', 'pitch', 'Morris', 'realize', 'cut', 'dreams', 'short', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'gone', 'little', 'coaxing', 'wager', 'team', 'Morris', 'out', 'Angelo', 'State', 'Bigs', 'story', 'then', 'ups', 'downs', 'being', 'minor', 'leaguer', 'Eventually', 'Tampa', 'Bay', 'Devil', 'Rays', 'call', 'up', 'asked', 'meet', 'team', 'Ballpark', 'Arlington', 'home', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'dream', 'making', 'story', 'story', 'so', 'great', 'wonderful', 'message', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'set', 'actual', 'events', 'cinematography', 'film', 'accurately', 'emotions', 'run', 'roughshod', 'over', 'Morris', 'make', 'Show', 'favorite', 'sequence', 'when', 'Arlington', 'walks', 'up', 'ballpark', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'Rangers', 'game', 'know', 'how', 'massive', 'imposing', 'Ballpark', 'Arlington', 'can', 'be', 'Imagine', 'walking', 'up', 'knowing', 'might', 'pitch', 'night', 'Arlington', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'great', 'history', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'Fenway', 'sheer', 'size', 'fearsome', 'thing', 'experience', 'camera', 'imposing', 'force', 'perfectly.Overall', 'great', 'family-oriented', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'down.Highly', 'recommended']",The Rookie

THE ROOKIE is the story of high school chemistry teacher Jim Morris, who in the short space of three months goes from tossing beaker tubes to hurling baseballs for the major league Tampa Bay Devils.  What makes this movie noteworthy is what it chose not to be.  Dennis Quaid, as Jim Morris, could have played him as a diamond version of ROCKY II, with all the hoopla and music of that film.  Instead, what you get is a traditional feel good movie minus the irritating schmaltz.The first half of the movie is more interesting than the latter half which details Morris' rapid climb from double A ball to the big show.  You see Morris as a little leaguer who lives only to play ball.  In this youthful Morris, you also see both Lou Gherig swatting baseballs through a grocer's window and just about every kid who has dreamed of playing major league pro ball.  There is also a carefully structured subtext of a father's need to play the heavy just to earn money to put bread on the table.  Morris' father has to continually move his family from state to state, with each time resulting in continuing disappointment for a boy who wants only to stay in one place long enough to finish a season with the same team.  This same theme that troubled his father early on returns to haunt the adult Morris, who finds that he has to make a similar decision concerning himself about whether he should surrender his dream of baseball and take a badly needed job of teaching or he should keep his dream even if his family suffers.  It is this battle of a good man wrestling with his conscience that makes THE ROOKIE resonate with a charm that has not been seen in any sports movie for a long time.  The baseball scenes detailing his high school winning streak that causes him to try out for the major leagues and his own duels on the mound are both thrilling and inspirational.  Yet, nowhere in the film does even one pitch not ring true.  Dennis Quaid plays Morris in the sort of low key manner that Gary Cooper as Lou Gherig or Jimmy Stewart as Monty Stratton showed in earlier decades.  Unlike Cooper or Stewart, Quaid permits himself the luxury of doubt, which in turn makes the ending even more of a treat.  The ROOKIE proves once again that success in life is not measured by the payoff of a dream but rather in having had that dream in the first place.",5,A Rookie Only On the Field,1039910400,"12 15, 2002",2002,2458,"['Sometimes', 'movie', 'along', 'very', 'first', 'reel', 'just', 'know', 'will', 'grab', 'human', 'interest', 'level', 'ROOKIE', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'who', 'short', 'space', 'three', 'months', 'tossing', 'beaker', 'tubes', 'hurling', 'baseballs', 'major', 'league', 'Tampa', 'Bay', 'Devils', 'What', 'movie', 'noteworthy', 'what', 'chose', 'not', 'be', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'diamond', 'version', 'ROCKY', 'II', 'hoopla', 'music', 'film', 'Instead', 'what', 'get', 'traditional', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'irritating', 'schmaltz.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'latter', 'half', 'details', 'Morris', 'rapid', 'climb', 'double', 'A', 'ball', 'big', 'show', 'see', 'Morris', 'little', 'leaguer', 'who', 'only', 'play', 'ball', 'youthful', 'Morris', 'also', 'see', 'Lou', 'Gherig', 'swatting', 'baseballs', 'grocer', 'window', 'just', 'kid', 'who', 'dreamed', 'playing', 'major', 'league', 'pro', 'ball', 'also', 'carefully', 'structured', 'subtext', 'father', 'need', 'play', 'heavy', 'just', 'earn', 'money', 'put', 'bread', 'table', 'Morris', 'father', 'continually', 'move', 'family', 'state', 'state', 'time', 'resulting', 'continuing', 'disappointment', 'boy', 'who', 'only', 'stay', 'one', 'place', 'long', 'enough', 'finish', 'season', 'same', 'team', 'same', 'theme', 'troubled', 'father', 'early', 'returns', 'haunt', 'adult', 'Morris', 'who', 'make', 'similar', 'decision', 'concerning', 'should', 'surrender', 'dream', 'baseball', 'take', 'badly', 'needed', 'job', 'teaching', 'should', 'keep', 'dream', 'even', 'family', 'suffers', 'battle', 'good', 'man', 'wrestling', 'conscience', 'ROOKIE', 'resonate', 'charm', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'sports', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'baseball', 'detailing', 'high', 'school', 'winning', 'streak', 'try', 'out', 'major', 'leagues', 'own', 'duels', 'mound', 'are', 'thrilling', 'inspirational', 'nowhere', 'film', 'even', 'one', 'pitch', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Morris', 'sort', 'low', 'key', 'manner', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Lou', 'Gherig', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Monty', 'Stratton', 'showed', 'earlier', 'decades', 'Cooper', 'Stewart', 'Quaid', 'luxury', 'doubt', 'turn', 'ending', 'even', 'more', 'treat', 'ROOKIE', 'once', 'again', 'success', 'life', 'not', 'measured', 'payoff', 'dream', 'rather', 'having', 'had', 'dream', 'first', 'place']",The Rookie
704427,A152C8GYY25HAH,B000068DBE,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","""The Rookie"" is a rather fictionalized account of the life of Jim Morris, whose promising career in minor league baseball was quashed by a shoulder injury in the 80s. He then became a high school science teacher and baseball coach in a small Texas town. Several years later, he tried out for major league team and became the oldest rookie in baseball in forty years. Morris played for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for several seasons.This unabashedly sentimental movie piles on the cliches - dreaming the impossible dream, turning the ragtag high school team into state champions, dealing with the wife who is supportive but worries about how the family will survive, etc. Still, the movie manages to be a rousing crowd-pleaser and has the distinction of being a genuine, old-fashioned family film. Rated `G', it manages to prove once more that, from time to time, a movie can be entertaining for all age groups without the use of foul language, violence, gross-out jokes and/or lots of exposed flesh. [I state this as a fact, not as any kind of moral judgment.]Key to the success of the movie is a dynamite performance by Dennis Quaid as Morris.

704429,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000068DBE,Mel Odom,"[5, 6]","A No-No is a pitcher's dream:  he throws nothing but strikes and not one of the opposing players earns a hit.  The real-life story of Jim Morris, high school science teacher turned Major League Baseball relief pitcher, made all the sports news in 1999.  Fans of baseball will remember the story at the time and the humble man that took the pitcher's mound that night in the Texas Rangers stadium against Royce Clayton.  Disney, scriptwriter Mike Rich, director John Lee Hancock and Dennis Quaid all combine forces to tell the story of Jim Morris' challenge to the high school baseball team he coached to follow their dreams, and of that team's deal with him to attempt to follow his own.Dennis Quaid is all-around one of the best, finest, and most natural actors around.  Quaid possesses a James Stewart kind of calm, quiet personality with his on-screen presence, but at the same time can play over-the-top roles such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Doc Holliday.  He easily carries a role laced with humor, suspense, or sadness, and his performance in THE ROOKIE is one of his most outstanding.  Mike Rich also wrote FINDING FORRESTER, which starred Sean Connery in a heart-warming role, and was extremely well-suited to find the essence of this story.  Director John Lee Hancock had done movies and television that included TV series FALCONE, L. A. DOCTORS, and wrote Kevin Costner's A PERFECT WORLD.From the opening montage of scenes depicting young Jimmy Morris' struggles to remain part of a team and play baseball in spite of his Navy father's constant movement to other posts, the viewer is grabbed by the simple emotional struggle that is pitched by the movie.  How does a man balance his dreams against the reality of trying to get by every day?  What does that man do if those dreams come roaring back in his face and refuses to die?  The first half of the movie is devoted to the wager Jim Morris made as coach to the Big Lake Owls:  that if they would win District he would try out for a pro baseball team.  Dennis Quaid's performance as Morris is absolutely flawless; his ingratiating charm and easy-going manner reels in the audience.  Angus T. Jones' part as Jim's son Hunter balances the love of baseball between man and boy, providing sharp counterpoints between what was and what is against what could be.  Rachel Griffiths' portrayal of Jim's wife Lorri also balances the acting and touches the hearts of the viewer as she is torn between wanting her husband to be a man who realizes the limitations of life and the woman who wants to see her husband have the chance to be a boy again.  The musical score that drives the whole movies is simply awesome.  When the characters or the dialogue doesn't pull at a viewer's heartstrings or render a feel-good moment, the music does.  Added to that is the 20-minute documentary included on the DVD that covers Jim Morris' story and the history of how the movie deal came together.The only thing that was really lacking was a brief overview of Jim's limited career in the Minors back in his twenties.  Perhaps it wasn't necessary to the overall story, but since his childhood was played out on-screen, that part of his life might have been mentioned and made a little clearer.THE ROOKIE is one of Disney's finest movies.  It reaches out and touches the heart, mind, and imagination of every viewer who has ever played baseball and wondered those magic words, ""What if?""  The story makes real the moments mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, and friends have sat in the bleachers and watched a young boy or man take his position out in the field and hope that was a catch, a hit, or a pitch that would give him the chance to shine for a brief, flickering instant.  For lovers of baseball, for people looking for a film to share with the family on a lazy evening, for Dennis Quaid fans, this DVD delivers one of the best.",5,Dennis Quaid and Disney Pitch a No-No,1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,3876,"['No-No', 'pitcher', 'dream', 'nothing', 'strikes', 'not', 'one', 'opposing', 'players', 'hit', 'real-life', 'story', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'turned', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'relief', 'pitcher', 'made', 'sports', 'news', '1999', 'Fans', 'baseball', 'will', 'remember', 'story', 'time', 'humble', 'man', 'took', 'pitcher', 'mound', 'night', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'stadium', 'Royce', 'Clayton', 'Disney', 'scriptwriter', 'Mike', 'Rich', 'director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'combine', 'forces', 'tell', 'story', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'challenge', 'high', 'school', 'baseball', 'team', 'coached', 'follow', 'dreams', 'team', 'deal', 'attempt', 'follow', 'own.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'all-around', 'one', 'best', 'finest', 'most', 'natural', 'actors', 'Quaid', 'James', 'Stewart', 'kind', 'calm', 'quiet', 'personality', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'play', 'over-the-top', 'roles', 'such', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'easily', 'role', 'laced', 'humor', 'suspense', 'sadness', 'performance', 'THE', 'ROOKIE', 'one', 'most', 'outstanding', 'Mike', 'Rich', 'also', 'wrote', 'FINDING', 'FORRESTER', 'starred', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'heart-warming', 'role', 'was', 'extremely', 'well-suited', 'find', 'essence', 'story', 'Director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'had', 'done', 'movies', 'television', 'included', 'TV', 'series', 'FALCONE', 'L.', 'A', 'DOCTORS', 'wrote', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'A', 'PERFECT', 'WORLD.From', 'opening', 'montage', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'young', 'Jimmy', 'Morris', 'struggles', 'remain', 'part', 'team', 'play', 'baseball', 'spite', 'Navy', 'father', 'constant', 'movement', 'other', 'posts', 'viewer', 'grabbed', 'simple', 'emotional', 'struggle', 'pitched', 'movie', 'How', 'man', 'balance', 'dreams', 'reality', 'trying', 'get', 'day', 'What', 'man', 'do', 'dreams', 'come', 'roaring', 'back', 'face', 'die', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'devoted', 'wager', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'made', 'coach', 'Big', 'Lake', 'Owls', 'would', 'win', 'District', 'would', 'try', 'out', 'pro', 'baseball', 'team', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'performance', 'Morris', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'ingratiating', 'charm', 'easy-going', 'manner', 'reels', 'audience', 'Angus', 'T.', 'Jones', 'part', 'Jim', 'son', 'Hunter', 'love', 'baseball', 'man', 'boy', 'providing', 'sharp', 'counterpoints', 'was', 'what', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'portrayal', 'Jim', 'wife', 'Lorri', 'also', 'acting', 'hearts', 'viewer', 'torn', 'wanting', 'husband', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'limitations', 'life', 'woman', 'who', 'see', 'husband', 'have', 'chance', 'be', 'boy', 'again', 'musical', 'score', 'whole', 'movies', 'simply', 'awesome', 'When', 'characters', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'pull', 'viewer', 'heartstrings', 'render', 'feel-good', 'moment', 'music', 'Added', '20-minute', 'documentary', 'included', 'DVD', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'story', 'history', 'how', 'movie', 'deal', 'came', 'together.The', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'really', 'lacking', 'was', 'brief', 'overview', 'Jim', 'limited', 'career', 'Minors', 'back', 'twenties', 'Perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'overall', 'story', 'childhood', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'on-screen', 'part', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'made', 'little', 'clearer.THE', 'ROOKIE', 'one', 'Disney', 'finest', 'movies', 'out', 'heart', 'mind', 'imagination', 'viewer', 'who', 'ever', 'played', 'baseball', 'wondered', 'magic', 'words', 'What', 'story', 'real', 'moments', 'mothers', 'fathers', 'siblings', 'grandparents', 'friends', 'have', 'sat', 'bleachers', 'watched', 'young', 'boy', 'man', 'take', 'position', 'field', 'hope', 'was', 'catch', 'hit', 'pitch', 'would', 'give', 'chance', 'shine', 'brief', 'flickering', 'instant', 'lovers', 'baseball', 'people', 'looking', 'film', 'share', 'family', 'lazy', 'evening', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'fans', 'DVD', 'one', 'best']",The Rookie

It was in his soul and he longed for his father's praise and attention. However, his father was a career military man and had little time for frivlous things like children and baseball.Being a military family, changing locations is a necessity and fact of life. However, to young Jimmy it meant the loss of friends and leaving a team that he felt he was an important part of.Eventually, the family moved to a small Texas town that didn't have a baseball team and for young Jimmy, it seemed that a dream would end or have to wait.The movie moves forward to when Jimmy is now age thirty-nine and the father of three children.  He is a high school chemistry coach and the school's baseball coach. His baseball career ended with an injury to his shoulder and now his dreams are met with coaching.Jimmy has a difficult time motivating these young boys in a town where football is the only game of importance. Eventually, he pitches batting practice and the team see his skills. The boys ask him why he gave up on his dream and do not accept his reason for giving up due to injury because his batting practice pitching is excellent.Jimmy and the boys strike a deal. If they are able to win the championship, he will try out for the pros.  It is as if the boys were reborn and life was good. They played well and became highly motivated, winning the championship against one of the only teams that had beaten them earlier.After this success, Jimmy and his son, Angus, went to a trial for baseball players. Even though he was old enough to be one of the fathers, he pitched amazingly well with his pitch speed reaching over ninety miles per hour.He makes the minor league team and plays minor league ball while his wife remains at home with the three children, bravely holding down the home while Jimmy follows his dream.The concept of following your dream is realized when Jimmy is called up to the major leagues. On the first game, most the people in his town come to the game, as does his wife and children and in a heart filled manner, so does his father, at last.Viewers will enjoy this film and may want to have it in their own libraries to relive the good feel from the story.Director John Lee  HandcockWriter = Mike RichCast = Dennis Quaid = Jimmy Morris, Jr.Rachel Griffits = Lori MorrisBrian Cox = Jimmy Morris, Sr.Angus T.

The first half of the movie, in which Quaid coaches his team of teenagers to the district championship, has charm and humor, but it isn't until the second half that it really takes off, as Morris finally gets to live his dream as a major-league pitcher. Director John Lee Hancock makes us feel the remarkable, fairy-tale force of what is happening to Morris, and Quaid gives a moving, quietly powerful performance as a man who can barely believe his good fortune.

Instead, scenes are shot artistically, there is space between events, the director and writers gave the time and energy to tell the story and tell the story well, and emotional cues aren't yanked one time too many.So, the story may be well-known to most but it's a phenomenal one to tell. Based on true life story of Jim Morris, he finds his way to Major League Baseball late in life as a relief pitcher for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays through the encouragement of his High School baseball team. What is really nice is the way the writers took the linear story and added an additional element of history to it. The story goes that in Big Springs, Texas some Nuns early on made a risky financial investment and prayed to the Saint of impossible dreams. Jim Morris's dream may seemed impossible but it is a source of encouragement and inspiration for the rest of us following our dreams.Dennis Quaid is quite good in the role and plays Jim Morris faithfully. The setting is a key element in a seemingly run-down town and run-down baseball lot in West Texas...a place that dreams are carried through.

""The Rookie"" is a film that gives us a compelling story of what it means to have dreams and how you should follow them. ""The Rookie"" is a film that is nothing short of extraordinary or powerful. The film focuses on the real-life story of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), the hero of this story, who has an awesome fastball that would turn heads of almost every major or minor league pitcher everywhere. When he was a kid, he was pressured by his father, Jim, Sr. (Brian Cox), who, to me, wants what's best for his son. Jim always practiced his pitching day in and day out. He always dreamed to be in the Major Leagues one day. Unexpectedly, he had an injury which forced him to give up baseball. In the present day, Jim is a high-school Science teacher and baseball coach. One day, while showing his team, the Owls, one of his trademark fastballs, they come up to Jim, asking him that if they win the finals, then Jim would try out for the Major Leagues. He agrees on it and the plan pretty much worked. On the day of the tryouts, Jim realized that he still had his powerful arm, no injuries and all. And with the support of his wife, Lorri (Rachel Griffiths), Jim gets a shot at the Major Leagues with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In fact, to me, this is Dennis Quaid's best performance in recent years compared to his 2000 film ""Frequency"". And I think that Quaid is like the Denzel Washington (""Titans"") of this film. And also, ""The Rookie"" provides some comic relief from another talented young actor, Angus T. Jones (""See Spot Run""), who plays Jim's son, Hunter. The performances of the Owls, including Jay Hernandez (""Crazy/Beautiful"") and Chad Lindberg (""The Fast and the Furious""), gave funny and touching performances as well. During the film, Jim comments to his high school team: ""If you don't have dreams, you don't have anything"", and I think that ""The Rookie"" shows you just how far one would go to achieve that lifelong dream. With terrific performances from a top-notch cast and a great storyline, ""The Rookie"" is the greatest Disney film that it has ever been my pleasure to see at the movie theater!

704456,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000068DBE,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 7]","When women feel the need for a &#65533;good cry&#65533; at the movies, they usually seek out some tragic tale of unrequited love to do the trick.  When men feel the same need, they turn to a film about baseball.  And what could be more guaranteed to convert a grown man into a shamelessly blubbering fool than a true-life account of a middle-aged baseball fanatic who gets to fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in the major leagues?  How many men can fail to identify with that?  Indeed, most men may not want to admit this, but the baseball movie genre has, in many ways, become the male equivalent of that category of film known, derisively by many men, as the &#65533;chick flick,&#65533; for they both serve roughly the same purpose.  Apparently, even we stoic males have the need to clear out the tear ducts every now and then - for purely medical reasons of course.Because baseball has long enjoyed the reputation of being &#65533;America&#65533;s National Pastime,&#65533; moviemakers have often treated it less as a sport than as an iconic institution.  From &#65533;Pride of the Yankees&#65533; to &#65533;Brian&#65533;s Song&#65533; to &#65533;Bang the Drum Slowly&#65533; to &#65533;The Natural&#65533; to &#65533;Field of Dreams,&#65533; movies about baseball have been so concerned with all the mythic implications of the sport that they have rarely managed to convey the sense of carefree fun that comes along with it (&#65533;Bull Durham&#65533; has been one of the few obvious exceptions to this rule).  The tone in these films is sometimes so sentimental and so reverential that one begins to view baseball more as a type of pseudo religion - with the stadium functioning as a sort of temple where people gather to participate in a communal spiritual experience - than as a form of entertainment.&#65533;The Rookie&#65533; certainly falls into this category, yet the film itself has such an air of comforting familiarity about it that it manages to override much of the conventionality of the storyline.  Although we always know where the movie is headed, the easy assuredness with which it charts its course keeps us interested and absorbed for most of the duration.  The majority of the credit goes to Dennis Quaid who, as Jim Morris, the high-school-teacher-turned-big-league-ballplayer, does a first rate job portraying a man torn between responsibility to his family and this golden, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of realizing a childhood dream.  Quaid underplays the role so nicely that we never doubt for a moment the authenticity of all we are seeing on screen.  The screenplay by Mike Rich, though filled with overly familiar scenes and characters, nevertheless manages to avoid many of the potential lapses into overwrought melodrama that could conceivably have robbed it of much of its credibility (the dark hints early on in the film as to Morris&#65533; problematic physical condition happily never come to fruition).

First, the local team, with no record of success over the past few years, starts off poorly.  They make a deal with their coach (played by Randy Quaid) that if they win the district championship, he--who had once labored in the vineyards of minor league baseball before calling it quits--would attend a try out and try to attain his dream.  Needless to say, things work out as you would expect.Then, upon attending a try out, the coach throws harder than he ever did in his earlier minor league efforts.  He goes from a mid-80 MPH fastball when he was younger to a 98 MPH fastball well into his thirties.  Makes one wonder?

For minor league pitcher Jim Morris those places were in his arm. He had his promising career derailed by injuries for a precious 12 years. In the interim he went back to school became a teacher, a husband, a father, and baseball coach. On a lark he tried out again for a team. Miraculously his arm had healed and he was throwing smoke; a blazing 98 MPH fastball. At the grand old age of 35 he fulfilled his life long dream of playing in the show.Writing in a similar vain as many of the themes of this movie, granted about a different sport and certainly arena, the words of novelist Brian DeVido come to mind 'I'd like to [compete] here. Be part of that select group, if only for one night...and I think I'd feel whole for once.' Jim Morris grew stronger at the broken places and was made whole again. Bravo!The night after watching this movie I had a delicious dream in technicolor that I was pitching on the mound at the old Yankee stadium.

704472,AHNT97DWEAQUY,B000068DBE,"Sumbudy ""buriedatlantis""","[7, 10]","Dennis Quaid totally owns this story of the real life Jim Morris.  A truly inspirational story that I wasn't aware of until I actually saw the movie.  The fact that it seems to have happened almost exactly as the movie portrays it makes it even more amazing.  Dennis does his best job of &quot;keeping it real&quot; in the movie.  I'm sure he had many opportunities to really go for the dramatic way of doing things, but he is totally grounded in real life.  He avoids that trap by making us believe that this guy could really be your next door neighbor.  Even though it's Quaid's show, the rest of the cast do a great job supporting him.  It's a safe bet that the movie wouldn't have been halfway entertaining without them.  Rachel Griffith as his wife is outstanding.  Their kids are scene stealers and you just have to love the high school team he coaches, along with some of his pals from around town.  Brian Cox puts in a good turn as the taciturn father, who in his sons eyes, could give a spit about his dreams.  But Cox plays the role in such a way, you can see that it's not all there is to it.  There is a sadness underneath at having to put up such a stern front.The story itself could have turned into a cliche riddled piece of &quot;movie of the week&quot; tripe, but there are things that keep it from such.  First, of course, is all the fine acting.  Second is the fact that it's almost as if there's two stories going on.  The first with Jim coaching his kids, then him going for his dreams.  You can tell this film is a labor of love from all involved.  It shows on screen.  The people making this movie truly cared for the story.  One of the best things about this movie is that it works more than just a baseball movie.  It's a great character piece, about following dreams and the love of family.  Sounds corny, I know, but when pulled off right, it's the stuff of coolness.  I believe that even if you don't like baseball that much, you'll find something here that's up your alley.  John Lee Hancock's direction flows in a nice, Texas like pace.  It's not in your face, it simply lets the story unfold, and I appreciate Hancock for doing this.  He's showed restraint when many filmmakers of today would edit this baby to bits, so kudos to him.  You've made this Texas boy proud.If you want other reasons this is a truly wonderful movie, simply start up the commentary with John Lee Hancock and Dennis Quaid.  They point out several moments that make this movie special.  You can tell they're real proud of their work.  Dennis goes as far as to say that it's his favorite movie he's ever been in, so that has to tell you something.  Some other good comments on what went on with the hows and whys of making the movie.There's seven deleted scenes that are of good enough quality that they could have been in the movie itself.  But, as director Hancock points out, the main reason most of them were taken out was due to time restraints.  So, it's nice to see them on the disc for all to enjoy.A neat little Spring Training feature gives you some usefull tips on playing the game of baseball.  This is great for people like me, who haven't the slightest idea of how to play the sport properly.  Whenever I play it (with friends), it's a simple matter of swinging at the pitches.  This has some interesting techniques and tips for the ignorant.Last, and certainly not least, is a 20 minute documentary on the man himself, Jim Morris.  It features interviews with him, the cast, some of his family and kids he coached.  A fairly inspiring feature in it's own right, you finish watching it totally understanding why one would want to make a movie on his life.  Plus, it gives us info the movie didn't really, such as the fact that Morris wasn't such a bad football player, either.All in all, I do believe this movie will go down as a classic when all is said and done.  It has all the makings of one, and it's one I enjoy more each time I watch it.  It will truly make you want to chase your dreams.",5,Works on all Levels.

It (The Rookie) tells the story of a potential sports hero getting his chance to be a hero when the odds are stacked against him.How could a family man that had his chance at playing organized baseball but unfortunately fell victim to injury wind up becoming one of the oldest rookies in Major League Baseball?  Watch the film and follow the journey of Jim Morris, the real life pitcher whose life was the basis of the movie.The DVD comes loaded with several nice extras which were carried to the Blu-ray disc as well.  Those extras help flesh out some details in the story and also show more of the real life Jim Morris who is portrayed well here by Dennis Quaid.I highly recommend this film for family viewing.

Okay, maybe the real Jim Morris could not throw ninety- eight miles per hour but it was still a good story.  One of the most dissapointing but one of my favorite scenes is when Jim stops on the road and decides to throw a baseball past the speed limit indicator.  He first gets like seventy- six miles per hour.  Than when he walks past the speed indicator to go get the ball the seventy-six turns into a ninety-six.  I am guessing the indicator did not work very well and it took a while for it to light up to what he really threw.  I also think it's neat how jim Morris si in a sort of a poor town and he gets to get noticed and still pitch for the majors.  It sure is dissaponting though that he had to be on the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.  That baseball team has been terrible every sibce it started.  They showed Royce Clayton up to bat for the Rangers.  This is in Jim's first games to pitch in the majors.  Royce Clayton does not even play for the Rangers anymore.  I wonder how they got him to be in the movie.  Another great plot and realistic one is when Jim can not seem to fit in with all the younger guys.  He is into different things then the young guys and seems to be the only one who has a wife.  Jim Morris's son is not annoying.  He was a great little actor in this movie.  Another realistic thing in this movie is when Jim comes to pitch and he's got a baby, a little daughter, and a little son.  He has to get the kids to change the diapers while he pitches.  That is so much like life.  Your wife might not be able to take the kids with her and your stuck with them while you have to do something way more important.  The young ballplayers on the team really must have wanted the coach to go to the majors because they made a deal with jim that if they won every game then he would have to pitch for the scouts and if they lost then they would have to run the whole practice that they had.  They won all their games so he had to try out.  He was a pretty good coach for that high school baseball team.  I think anybody should buy this movie.

Dennis Quaid plays a real-life high school teacher and baseball coach in West Texas who successfully landed a major league pitching gig for the Tampa Bay Rays after trying out for the team to keep a promise to his players. Like most Disney movies, the film is full of superficial and glib moments, and it's ultimately less moving than it could or should be. Based on the real-life player's memoirs, and filmed not long after the actual events, it is likewise limited by its fidelity to the author's narcissistic self-image. In particular, something rings false about his insistence (as played by Quaid in the movie) that he's playing Major League Baseball to give his own children a hero to admire. Considering that he's basically abandoned his family and high school paycheck to play baseball on the road, it's really hard to see how he's following his dream for anyone other than himself, as his wife and kids get no particular benefit from it -- and his kids are too young to really understand what daddy is doing. But Dennis Quaid is likable in the lead role and his final scene with his emotionally distant father at the film's end is a touching moment in an otherwise trite screenplay.

704480,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000068DBE,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","At last, hugely underrated actor Dennis Quaid gets his due respect.  He should have been much more famous long before -- see his Doc in Kevin Costner's &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; -- but the time has come.  Dennis Quaid plays Jim Morris, a major league pitcher who has an amazing story to tell.  And that goes like this:As a kid living in Texas, Jim Morris was dreaming of one day becoming a baseball player in Major League.  Having a good talent as pitcher, he had been dreaming of making it Major  league player, but now his dream is gone.  Being 35 years-old, and good father of loving family, he now teaches chemstry at a local high school, and is a coach of ragtag baseball team there.  But one deal with the kids -- that if they win the tournament, Jim also tries out for Major League -- reminds him of his old dream that were long forgotten deep in his heart.  The rest of the story is just a miracle.Baseball rules in Hollywood; and this film turned out an unexpected hit in 2002, and the cast and crew deserve the succuss.  Dennis Quiad brings irresitible charm into the character of Jim Morris (himself appearing as an umpire).  True, the script by Mike Rich (debuted with &quot;Finding Forrester&quot;) shows nothing particularly new.  But even so, it is remarkable for not making any wrong steps throughout (except, possibly, the opening few minutes including two nuns and flower petals), and the direction of newcomer John Lee Hancock is slick and natural.  Female supporting role played by Rachel Griffiths is, as you find in this genre of baseball flicks, a very typical one, an always supportive and understanding wife, but she does it gracefully, and no one can deny her engaging  presence.The real story is just a bit different from how the film depicts -- Jim Morris was a player in Minor League before his career as a teacher, for instance, but that part is missing from the film even though the final result is utterly heart-warming.  Don't say that just because this is G-rated Disney film, it is sugar-coated &quot;feel-good&quot; nonsense.  The film has actually a good, old-fashioned story that tells us dreams come true, and when you get a good story like this, all you have to do is tell it straight.  And that's the best part of the film.If you happen to love &quot;The Rookie,&quot; see some other films like &quot;The Natural&quot;, &quot;The Stratton Story&quot;, and  &quot;The Pride of the Yankees.&quot;  Even if you don't like the team, you will like Jimmy and Gary, all-American heroes.",5,Never Too Late for Dreaming; Underrated Quaid Finally Did It,1046563200,"03 2, 2003",2003,2517,"['last', 'hugely', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'due', 'respect', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'famous', 'long', 'before', 'see', 'Doc', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'quot', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'quot', 'time', 'come', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'major', 'league', 'pitcher', 'who', 'amazing', 'story', 'tell', 'kid', 'living', 'Texas', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'was', 'dreaming', 'one', 'day', 'becoming', 'baseball', 'player', 'Major', 'League', 'Having', 'good', 'talent', 'pitcher', 'had', 'been', 'dreaming', 'making', 'Major', 'league', 'player', 'now', 'dream', 'gone', 'Being', '35', 'years-old', 'good', 'father', 'loving', 'family', 'now', 'chemstry', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'coach', 'ragtag', 'baseball', 'team', 'there', 'one', 'deal', 'kids', 'win', 'tournament', 'Jim', 'also', 'out', 'Major', 'League', 'old', 'dream', 'were', 'long', 'forgotten', 'deep', 'heart', 'rest', 'story', 'just', 'miracle.Baseball', 'rules', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'unexpected', 'hit', '2002', 'cast', 'crew', 'deserve', 'succuss', 'Dennis', 'Quiad', 'irresitible', 'charm', 'character', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'appearing', 'umpire', 'True', 'script', 'Mike', 'Rich', 'debuted', 'quot', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'quot', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'new', 'even', 'so', 'remarkable', 'not', 'making', 'wrong', 'steps', 'possibly', 'opening', 'few', 'minutes', 'including', 'two', 'nuns', 'flower', 'petals', 'direction', 'newcomer', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'slick', 'natural', 'Female', 'supporting', 'role', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'find', 'genre', 'baseball', 'flicks', 'very', 'typical', 'one', 'always', 'supportive', 'understanding', 'wife', 'gracefully', 'one', 'can', 'deny', 'engaging', 'presence.The', 'real', 'story', 'just', 'bit', 'different', 'how', 'film', 'depicts', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'was', 'player', 'Minor', 'League', 'career', 'teacher', 'instance', 'part', 'missing', 'film', 'even', 'final', 'result', 'utterly', 'heart-warming', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'just', 'G-rated', 'Disney', 'film', 'sugar-coated', 'quot', 'feel-good', 'quot', 'nonsense', 'film', 'actually', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'story', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'when', 'get', 'good', 'story', 'have', 'do', 'tell', 'straight', 'best', 'part', 'film.If', 'happen', 'love', 'quot', 'Rookie', 'quot', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'quot', 'Natural', 'quot', 'quot', 'Stratton', 'Story', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Yankees.', 'quot', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'team', 'will', 'like', 'Jimmy', 'Gary', 'all-American', 'heroes']",The Rookie
704481,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B000068DBE,Tucker Andersen,"[2, 3]","This is undoubtedly one of the best baseball movies ever made and one that will be enjoyed by anyone who has dreams and believes that you should never lose hope. As is well known to baseball fans, at age 35 Jim Morris became one of the oldest rookies in recent history to break into the major leagues when he became a relief pitcher with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. (Several players from the Negro Leagues were older when the color line in the majors was finally broken.) This is his story.Due to bad luck and arm surgery, Jim had given up on his dreams and was teaching and coaching high school ball in Texas but continued to throw because he loved the game. He was also married with three small children. As motivation to his team, he agreed that if they fulfilled their dream of making the state playoffs after several losing seasons in a town where football was king, he would go to tryout camp one more time. Much to his amazement, they turned their season around;  he tried out, threw the ball at 98 MPH despite the disbelief of the professional scouts, and as they say, the rest is history.Dennis Quaid is perfect as Morris, and Rachel Griffiths conveys her ambivalence at seeing her husband put his life on hold and leave his family to ride around the country on minor league busses despite his father's advice that it was time to get on with his life rather than pursue his dream. The high school kids and townspeople are all memorable characters who become as familiar as our neighbors during the movie, and Morris' son is a real scene stealer.Finally the pace of the movie is appropriate to the sport, rather than being hurried the story is allowed to unfold in the same enjoyable way a game can be watched on a sunny afternoon (even the grass on the field has a place in the story). Thus, the suspense is not about what will eventually happen, but rather how it happens. You get to enjoy watching the character development and the many interesting incidents that lend color to the story along the way. And the pitching sequences are vintage baseball for the true fans.I saw this several times in the theatre. The DVD has additional material, including comments by the real Jim Morris. While it is enjoyable even on a screen as small as those at airline seats, I recommend  watching it on as large a TV screen as possible because the baseball scenes themselves are much more lifelike.",5,A Real Life FIELD OF DREAMS,1033948800,"10 7, 2002",2002,2393,"['undoubtedly', 'one', 'best', 'baseball', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'who', 'dreams', 'should', 'never', 'lose', 'hope', 'well', 'known', 'baseball', 'fans', 'age', '35', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'became', 'one', 'oldest', 'rookies', 'recent', 'history', 'break', 'major', 'leagues', 'when', 'became', 'relief', 'pitcher', 'Tampa', 'Bay', 'Devil', 'Rays', 'Several', 'players', 'Negro', 'Leagues', 'were', 'older', 'when', 'color', 'line', 'majors', 'was', 'finally', 'broken', 'story.Due', 'bad', 'luck', 'arm', 'surgery', 'Jim', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'dreams', 'was', 'teaching', 'coaching', 'high', 'school', 'ball', 'Texas', 'continued', 'throw', 'loved', 'game', 'was', 'also', 'married', 'three', 'small', 'children', 'motivation', 'team', 'agreed', 'fulfilled', 'dream', 'making', 'state', 'playoffs', 'several', 'losing', 'seasons', 'town', 'where', 'football', 'was', 'king', 'would', 'go', 'tryout', 'camp', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Much', 'amazement', 'turned', 'season', 'around', 'tried', 'out', 'threw', 'ball', '98', 'MPH', 'disbelief', 'professional', 'scouts', 'say', 'rest', 'history.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'perfect', 'Morris', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'ambivalence', 'seeing', 'husband', 'put', 'life', 'hold', 'leave', 'family', 'ride', 'country', 'minor', 'league', 'father', 'advice', 'was', 'time', 'get', 'life', 'rather', 'pursue', 'dream', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'townspeople', 'are', 'memorable', 'characters', 'who', 'become', 'as', 'familiar', 'neighbors', 'movie', 'Morris', 'son', 'real', 'scene', 'stealer.Finally', 'pace', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'sport', 'rather', 'being', 'hurried', 'story', 'allowed', 'unfold', 'same', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'game', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'sunny', 'afternoon', 'even', 'grass', 'field', 'place', 'story', 'Thus', 'suspense', 'not', 'what', 'will', 'eventually', 'happen', 'rather', 'how', 'get', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'character', 'development', 'many', 'interesting', 'incidents', 'lend', 'color', 'story', 'way', 'pitching', 'sequences', 'are', 'vintage', 'baseball', 'true', 'fans.I', 'saw', 'several', 'times', 'theatre', 'DVD', 'additional', 'material', 'including', 'comments', 'real', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'screen', 'as', 'small', 'airline', 'seats', 'recommend', 'watching', 'large', 'TV', 'screen', 'possible', 'baseball', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'lifelike']",The Rookie
704482,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,B000068DBE,Utah Blaine,"[0, 0]","There have been hundreds of movies made about baseball:  some forgetable duds, many decent films, and a few all time classics that define how baseball is a reflection of America.  The film `The Rookie' is in this latter category.  It is the true life (although heavily dramatized, I'm sure) story of Jim Morris, a high school teacher and baseball coach in Texas who attended a tryout for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at the urging of his players and eventually made it to the majors for the first time in his mid-30s, an unprecedented event.  The thing that makes this movie great is that it is about more than just baseball, it is about dreams.  Many people dream about doing great things, but it takes courage and determination to actually get up and do it and overcome the fear of failure.  Jimmy Morris always dreamed about playing baseball and spent some time in the minors as a young man, getting hurt and never making it to the major leagues.  His desire to play baseball never left him though, and even after he got married, started a family, and settled down to a regular job, he never forgot his dream.  Unlike most people, he got a second chance to try to do what he loved and he made the most of his opportunity.  Throw in a beautiful, spunky wife (played by Rachel Griffiths) and a complex, unhappy relationship with his father, and you have a great story.  There are so many great scenes in this movie that are so well done and so memorable.  Jim making it to the big leagues is great, of course (I imagine that virtually anyone would be in a daze the first time they sit in a big league dugout).  The best scene of the movie is the one where Jim tosses a ball past a traffic radar to see how fast he is throwing and the reading gives a speed in the high seventies (mph), and as Jim walks away to pick up the ball, the reading changes to a velocity in the high 90s.  All time classic!  People will be watching this 100 years from now.  Is this movie cheesy and over-melodramatic at times?  You bet.  A great family movie?  Absolutely!  It would be great if every American, once in their life, could feel like Jim Morris when he comes out of the bullpen for the first time.  Most of us may never get that chance, but it is great watching Jim do it!",5,Don't be afraid to chase your dreams,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,2257,"['have', 'been', 'hundreds', 'movies', 'made', 'baseball', 'forgetable', 'duds', 'many', 'decent', 'films', 'few', 'time', 'classics', 'define', 'how', 'baseball', 'reflection', 'America', 'film', 'Rookie', 'latter', 'category', 'true', 'life', 'heavily', 'dramatized', ""'m"", 'sure', 'story', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'baseball', 'coach', 'Texas', 'who', 'attended', 'tryout', 'Tampa', 'Bay', 'Devil', 'Rays', 'urging', 'players', 'eventually', 'made', 'majors', 'first', 'time', 'mid-30s', 'unprecedented', 'event', 'thing', 'movie', 'great', 'more', 'just', 'baseball', 'dreams', 'Many', 'people', 'dream', 'doing', 'great', 'things', 'courage', 'determination', 'actually', 'get', 'up', 'do', 'overcome', 'fear', 'failure', 'Jimmy', 'Morris', 'always', 'dreamed', 'playing', 'baseball', 'spent', 'time', 'minors', 'young', 'man', 'getting', 'hurt', 'never', 'making', 'major', 'leagues', 'desire', 'play', 'baseball', 'never', 'left', 'even', 'got', 'married', 'started', 'family', 'settled', 'down', 'regular', 'job', 'never', 'forgot', 'dream', 'most', 'people', 'got', 'second', 'chance', 'try', 'do', 'what', 'loved', 'made', 'most', 'opportunity', 'Throw', 'beautiful', 'spunky', 'wife', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'complex', 'unhappy', 'relationship', 'father', 'have', 'great', 'story', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'memorable', 'Jim', 'making', 'big', 'leagues', 'great', 'course', 'imagine', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'daze', 'first', 'time', 'sit', 'big', 'league', 'dugout', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'where', 'Jim', 'ball', 'traffic', 'radar', 'see', 'how', 'fast', 'throwing', 'reading', 'speed', 'high', 'seventies', 'mph', 'Jim', 'away', 'pick', 'up', 'ball', 'reading', 'changes', 'velocity', 'high', '90s', 'time', 'classic', 'People', 'will', 'be', 'watching', '100', 'years', 'now', 'movie', 'cheesy', 'over-melodramatic', 'times', 'bet', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'Absolutely', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'American', 'once', 'life', 'could', 'feel', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'when', 'bullpen', 'first', 'time', 'Most', 'may', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'great', 'watching', 'Jim', 'do']",The Rookie

The most successful of these are children's films that provide a second level of entertainment for their parents (such as the many Muppets movies).In &quot;The Rookie&quot; this is reversed. We have an inspiring film with mature themes that has something to entertain and inspire the kids as well. Sadly the term &quot;mature&quot; has been reduced to include themes that would include &quot;immature&quot; in my opinion, but that's another story. Here the mature themes are about father-son relationships (both directions), about responsibility, about motivation, and about pursuing your dreams, even after it seems like it's too late.Many people who are parents (or grandparents) have had to set their dreams aside for one reason or another. But often those dreams are still smoldering, waiting for an opportunity be rekindled. In this case, the dream is about becoming a major league pitcher.

He had grown up with an overpowering desire to make it to the major leagues as a pitcher and was good enough to be drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers.  After making it to the Double A professional ranks he sustained an arm injury that put him out of baseball.Years later, at age 35, Morris was teaching chemistry in a Texas high school and coaching the baseball team.  His first dream was to see a team with a previously woeful record win the district championship.  When his players respond to his message and achieve success they lobby assertively for him to practice what he preached to them in his own baseball career.  Seeing his burning fastball on display, they urge him to return to the game and make a solid bid to acquire a place on a major league roster.Morris' spirited quest ultimately results in a spot on the American League roster of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.  The pumped up Morris, who was able to throw at a speed of around 87 miles an hour before he threw his arm out, was able to reach an impressively lofty figure of 98 miles an hour at 35.  In most baseball careers the opposite occurs with pitchers chalking up higher marks in their twenties, then sustaining their careers on control and an assortment of pitches.  Morris caps his herculean quest by being called in from the bullpen to pitch against the Texas Rangers in Arlington, where he strikes out his rival on four pitches with his blazing 98 mile an hour fastball.While ""The Rookie"" should entertain baseball fans, its inspirational message of triumphing over adversity is universal, making it a film like ""Pride of the Yankees"" and ""Field of Dreams"" that moves considerably beyond any sports film genre.

704488,AP3B615GM191G,B000068DBE,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Being a Disney production, ""The Rookie"" could easily have settled to become a weepy dramatic tale dripping with over-dramatized scenes.  Luckily, thanks to great acting and an attention to detail, this movie is instead a great human drama focusing on baseball themes.For a basic plot summary, ""The Rookie"" tells the true story of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a 36-year old high school chemistry teacher in Texas.  After a lifetime of being uprooted time and time again by his military father (Brian Cox), Morris also had his big-league baseball dream cut short by arm injuries.  While coaching high school baseball in Texas and raising a family, he suddenly discovers that his left arm has some serious juice left in it.  On a bet that inspires his young charges, Morris shows up at a MLB tryout and begins the journey he had thought was dormant forever.The reason this movie is so moving is because it weaves so many human-drama themes into the proceedings.  Many potential viewers may dismiss it as a ""baseball movie"", but to do so would be foolish.  This is more truly a story of family and one man's journey to make peace with his life.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't like a story like this.  It is just so emotional as Morris interacts with his children, wife, parents, and others affiliated with the baseball side of his life.Only helping the drama spring to life is the incredible acting.  I've seen Quaid in many movie roles, and this one is eclipsed by none of them.  His body language and facial expressions carry the emotionally-charged scenes.  The supporting cast around him (especially Rachel Griffiths and Angus Young as Morris' wife and son) also shines and really, truth be told, are very much more than ""supporting"".  They are the reasons why Morris does what he does.Overall, I consider ""The Rookie"" to be the epitome of a solid, wholesome family drama (and just an incredibly compelling story to boot).  I'm a big baseball fan, so perhaps I can appreciate the deeper, more embedded themes of the film more than the non-sports viewer, but to me this is five-star material all the way.",5,"It Could Have Settled, But Instead Achieved Greatness (Just Like Its Source Material)",1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,2108,"['Being', 'Disney', 'production', 'Rookie', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'settled', 'become', 'weepy', 'dramatic', 'tale', 'dripping', 'over-dramatized', 'scenes', 'Luckily', 'thanks', 'great', 'acting', 'attention', 'detail', 'movie', 'instead', 'great', 'human', 'drama', 'focusing', 'baseball', 'themes.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Rookie', 'true', 'story', 'Jim', 'Morris', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', '36-year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'Texas', 'lifetime', 'being', 'uprooted', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'military', 'father', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Morris', 'also', 'had', 'big-league', 'baseball', 'dream', 'cut', 'short', 'arm', 'injuries', 'coaching', 'high', 'school', 'baseball', 'Texas', 'raising', 'family', 'suddenly', 'left', 'arm', 'serious', 'juice', 'left', 'bet', 'young', 'charges', 'Morris', 'up', 'MLB', 'tryout', 'journey', 'had', 'thought', 'was', 'dormant', 'forever.The', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'moving', 'so', 'many', 'human-drama', 'themes', 'proceedings', 'Many', 'potential', 'viewers', 'may', 'dismiss', 'baseball', 'movie', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'more', 'truly', 'story', 'family', 'one', 'man', 'journey', 'make', 'peace', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'emotional', 'Morris', 'children', 'wife', 'parents', 'others', 'affiliated', 'baseball', 'side', 'life.Only', 'helping', 'drama', 'spring', 'life', 'incredible', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Quaid', 'many', 'movie', 'roles', 'one', 'eclipsed', 'none', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expressions', 'carry', 'emotionally-charged', 'scenes', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'Angus', 'Young', 'Morris', 'wife', 'son', 'also', 'shines', 'really', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'supporting', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'Morris', 'what', 'consider', 'Rookie', 'be', 'epitome', 'solid', 'wholesome', 'family', 'drama', 'just', 'incredibly', 'compelling', 'story', 'boot', ""'m"", 'big', 'baseball', 'fan', 'perhaps', 'can', 'appreciate', 'deeper', 'more', 'embedded', 'themes', 'film', 'more', 'non-sports', 'viewer', 'five-star', 'material', 'way']",The Rookie

It was in watching Rookie that I realized why, as I listened to Jim Morris, played by Dennis Quaid, talk about his dreams. Sports movies are often less about sports and more about beating the odds to capture a dream held close to the heart. These are stories of hope, courage, determination, persistence, and a passion for doing what one is meant to do.In line with this, sports movies are fequently devoid of special effects. No glitz. No flashy distraction. Just good down to earth  stories with a lot of heart.Rookie ranks with perhaps the top ten, if not top five, of my favorite movies. All the elements of a good plot are here. It doesn't hurt that the story is a true one, based on Jim Morris, as told in his own words, about how he came to play for the Tampa  Bay Devil Rays as an ""old man.""The story begins with the boy, whose military, emotionally distant father is completely insensitive to his son's need for his attention and support. Boy loves baseball, with a passion, but father moves the family from town to town in pursuit of his military career, and he runs his family in a similarly military manner: cold, commanding, no arguments. From time to time, Jim makes an effort to solicit his father's approval, but it is not forthcoming.The final military post brings the family to a small town in Texas, and it seems no one there cares about baseball. What the boy hasn't found in his father, he appears to find in the warm heart of a store owner who may not carry ""baseball stuff"" among his merchandise, but, seeing the crestfallen and lonely boy's face at this news, immediately brings out a catalog with promises of ordering all things baseball.The story jumps to the adult Morris. He has a family, a wife who is the good woman behind the good man, two small children. His young son, Hunter, played by Angus T. Jones (today of ""Two and a Half Men"" fame), is something of a star in this movie, too, tugging at the heartstrings as he portrays how a son looks to his father to be his hero. Morris has become a high school science teacher who coaches the school baseball team, the Owls. His dreams, it seems, are long over. He had been on the brink of playing professional baseball, but injuries kept him on the sidelines, and he quit his dream before it was his. Morris's bitterness with his father's lack of support is still very much alive in the adult son, and there are great scenes between the man and his elderly father (played by Brian Cox), who with age has mellowed, has been divorced by his wife, lives alone, and still has no understanding about the sport, but at last senses he has not been much of a dad.When the Owls do poorly on the field, coach Morris chides them on not playing with enough passion. He talks to them about not giving up. I cheered out loud, yes!, when his team called him on his own hypocrisy. They have seen him pitch, they know their coach not only still has his good arm, they know he still aches to follow his dream, even if he has lost courage. A deal is struck. They will win their tournament, but then their coach must  go to the try-outs.They win the tournament.It's an absolutely wonderful scene as Morris struggles with his children while going to the try-outs. He hasn't had the guts to tell his wife about this ""foolish"" settling of a deal, and he ends up with a crying baby in a stroller, his small son cheering from the back of a pickup truck, while other athletes chuckle at the ""old man"" trying to pitch. Until he throws the pitch. He clocks 98 miles per hour.And it's a beautiful thing, how Morris continues to struggle with doubts and is torn between following his old dream and being with the family he so loves. He goes back and forth more than once. He even asks his father for advice--who gives him advice he doesn't want to hear. At one point, his wife withholds her support. This is madness, and the family can't live on $600 a month while daddy plays ball. But when she realizes how much her son Hunter looks up to his father, how important it is to not only hear the good advice of a father, but to see that father as a role model who shows the courage and determination to face his fears and give his dream a try, well, she gives in. She not only gives in, she becomes her husband's biggest fan, except perhaps Hunter.Morris ends up playing major league baseball. The hard pursuit comes to its most satisfying end. Yes, Hunter, your daddy is a hero. And Morris, pitching his first major league game, finally makes peace with his father. Who still may not understand baseball. But who is finally starting to understand about being a father.Six stars.
