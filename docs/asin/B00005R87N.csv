678318,ATOK2HUHCVNPY,B00005R87N,410,"[0, 1]","Made just as the US entered the second world war, this goofy zombie horror comedy is breezy fun throughout its 67 minute running time.  Some US agents and their servant crash their plane on a creepy, remote island.  They find a shadow mansion populated by a staid German doctor, his staff, and his wife, who is said to be afflicted with an illness leaving her in a trance-like state.  First the servants give hints that voodoo practices have resulted in many zombies on the island, and it isn't long before Mantan Moreland, the aide to the agents, finds himself amusingly unable to convince his employers that dark mischief abounds, possibly rooted in the workings of the mysterious German.  Mantan Moreland steals the proceedings as the constant scaredy cat, though his role is far from PC and is rooted in servant stereotypes.  He is partly redeemed by being the only character to show some common sense, let alone some acting charisma; most of the other performances are fairly stiff, and I'm not counting the zombies!  Lots of fun to be had in details such a the zombies having to be on a special low-salt diet, Moreland's crisis of whether he himself is a zombie or merely hypnotized, and... are those voodoo drums or Gene Krupa?Typical dialogue:""I've seen em with my own eyes!""""He seems to be troubled with hallucinations""""No sir, zombies.

678320,ACGOT6Z1UX6X7,B00005R87N,David A. Plouffe,"[2, 3]","I wasn't quite sure what to make of this movie by the title and actor list.  Don't let the title fool you into thinking this is a movie along the lines of Night of the Living Dead, it isn't.  This is really a light-hearted, comedy-mystery-thriller, along the lines of The Ghost Breakers, or as mentioned by another reviewer Spooks Run Wild, which happens to also have been produced by the same studio, Monogram.King of the Zombies is a true ""B"" movie with a great supporting cast.  Mantan Moreland is responsible for the comedy element throughout the movie and does a great job.  This was my first introduction to him and I am looking forward to seeing more of his movies.As the movie runs just over an hour, it moves at a comfortable pace. A group of three men, in search of a missing plane flown by an important military officer, crash land on an island.  The island appears to be deserted except for a mansion inhabited by a mad doctor and an odd group of servants, including Zombies.  The doctor has no knowledge of the missing plane, or so he says, but is willing to put the men up until they can be rescued.  They become suspicious of the doctor and their snooping reveals many secrets.  Though the ending is relatively uneventful, it really is the path of the story that makes this movie so enjoyable.As with many of the Monogram pictures, there is a bit of propaganda sprinkled throughout.  For example, the enemy ends up being the Germans.  It is also interesting to consider the way that other races were once viewed and treated.

678321,A3OV2QDCLAV9H3,B00005R87N,El Jimbo,"[0, 1]","Zombies of the 40's and 50's are kind of like the early Klingons of Star Trek.  Not a bit like the zombies of today.  These guys are just stiff sloughing guys who walk like they hypnotized instead of dead guys brought back to life.  Of course, it's never really clear whether they are zombies or not, anyway.  The plot revolves around two white guys and a black guy who crash on an island somewhere in the Atlantic.  You get this from the references early in the movie although it is never established where the island is.The humor is relentless, especially with the manservant ""Jeff"" played by Mantan Moreland.  If you've seen some of these movies with the wide-eyed overly frightened stereotypical black man before you know what I mean.  Unless you come into this movie with an open mind as to the way the typical black man was portrayed in those days you are apt to find it offensive.  But keep in mind that at least it IS a black man and not some white guy in black face.I don't know if all of it was intended to be as funny as it is, but it will give you a few laughs.  Henry Victor as the villain (must not have been able to get Bela Lugosi or Boris Karloff on their budget, or maybe they thought the script was too ridiculous.)Once you get through with the movie, you can take it and use it as a coaster, but you still have a T-shirt.

Kingery ""Love's Old Movies""","[4, 4]","This review is of the Movie ""King of the Zombies""..I have not purchased this DVD listed as..""Remastered Edition""...and would like to know just what it contain's to make it sell for $14.00? As I write this, I just finished watching the movie on a new movie channel here In KC.MO...and had not seen it before. I like it and part of the reason was due to, ""Mantan Moreland"" I had not seen him in anything other than the Charilie Chan Movie's...and always felt the Chan movie's were good due to a large part that Mantan Moreland was in them. He always played the part of the scared stiff in those movies and does so in this one. This movie is Pretty much about a plane heading to the Bahamas...got off course and crashed on this little island..when they find themselves in a house with ""Zombies"". When I finish with the review, I will see if there are any review's about this movie on the other DVD offered. I would like to see if it give's any details about that DVD that is different than the one offered here for $14. The price of the other one is .99...so it is worth the price and I would pay a lot more for it..just because Mantan Moreland is in it. I grew up watching these kind of movies in the late 50's...so I always look forward to seeing them again. Of course most of the time, the are not the great movie I remember...but still worth watching again...and since I had not seen this one before, it was a pleasure to watch..The other actors were very reconizable and played in many movie's like this back then.

678323,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005R87N,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 5]","This movie appears to be an attempt to capitalize on every possible contemporary issue and popular subject of the late 1930's and early 1940's.  There are spies, Nazis, zombies and an African American comedian thrown in for good measure.  I would say the director threw in everything but the kitchen sink, but there was one of those too.  The primary plot is generally dull and lifeless, but the comedy in this movie is classic.Our story begins with three people in an airplane lost over the ocean.  They desperately scan for a radio beacon to find an airport, finding instead a suspicious radio conversation.  The trio, James ""Mac"" McCarthy (Dick Purcell, who managed 74 film appearances before his untimely death in 1944), his servant Jefferson ""Jeff"" Jackson (comedian Mantan Moreland, who is one of the best things about this movie; Moreland became a regular in the Charlie Chan movies of the 1940's), and pilot Bill Summers (John Archer, who was near the beginning of a career that would eventually span 60 years) crash onto the island and discover suspicious happenings.We soon learn that an admiral is missing, and that can only mean one thing.  Yep, you got it; the admiral has to be on the island somewhere.  The local guy in power appears to be Dr. Miklos Sangre (Henry Victor, who appeared in many spy movies as well as the cult classic ""Freaks"").  He has assorted house guests, including a bevy of genuine zombies.  We also learn that Dr. Sangre is attempting to use voodoo to gain the secrets of the admiral.Most of this movie was bizarre.  I kept wondering why the various characters did the things they did.  The one thing that made this movie survivable was the antics of Mantan Moreland and beautiful Marguerite Whitten as Samantha the maid.  Both actors were far superior to any of the other actors in this movie.  Moreland's style of comedy may seem to step too closely to the degrading stereotypes of the era, but it was also evident that servant Jeff Jackson and maid Samantha were the only two characters who knew what was really going on and were the only characters smart enough to stay out of the way of trouble.  Moreland's lead in taking the zombies to dinner is easily the best part of this movie and that scene showcased the talents of both performers.My first impression of this movie is that it tried to squeeze too many subplots into its short length.  We have Nazis, zombies, a missing admiral, a love story, a crash and more.  The director avoided the problem caused by having a lot of plots by spending very little time on developing any of the plots.  I thought this movie was about the missing admiral, but the movie seemed to wander around for a while and the missing admiral got very little face time until near the end of the movie.  Even after watching the movie the most memorable portions were those featuring Moreland and Whitten.  My general impression is that this movie is a comedy that also has some stuff about zombies and an admiral in it.  At least, that is the way I am going to remember the movie.I could easily dismiss this movie as worthless, and it nearly is.  However, all the scenes with Moreland and Whitten were enjoyable.  Whitten was a wonderfully smooth actress who commanded her role.  Moreland is a natural comedian whose presence made him the focus of every scene he was in.  This movie is rare in that African American performers were the lead characters in several scenes though Caucasian performers were the nominal stars of the movie.  I recommend this movie for the presence of these two stars.  However, be aware that much of the humor in this movie would be considered unacceptable by today's standards.Before I forget, the title of this movie borders on the absurd.  Dr. Sangre was a Nazi experimenting with hypnosis and voodoo.  He was far from the ""King of the Zombies.""  Sometimes movie titles are more impressive than the movies themselves.Enjoy!",3,Where Do These Titles Come From?,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,3924,"['movie', 'be', 'attempt', 'capitalize', 'possible', 'contemporary', 'issue', 'popular', 'subject', 'late', '1930', 'early', '1940', 'are', 'spies', 'Nazis', 'zombies', 'African', 'American', 'comedian', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'would', 'say', 'director', 'threw', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'there', 'was', 'one', 'too', 'primary', 'plot', 'generally', 'dull', 'lifeless', 'comedy', 'movie', 'classic.Our', 'story', 'three', 'people', 'airplane', 'lost', 'ocean', 'desperately', 'scan', 'radio', 'beacon', 'find', 'airport', 'finding', 'instead', 'suspicious', 'radio', 'conversation', 'trio', 'James', 'Mac', 'McCarthy', 'Dick', 'Purcell', 'who', 'managed', '74', 'film', 'appearances', 'untimely', 'death', '1944', 'servant', 'Jefferson', 'Jeff', 'Jackson', 'comedian', 'Mantan', 'Moreland', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'movie', 'Moreland', 'became', 'regular', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'movies', '1940', 'pilot', 'Bill', 'Summers', 'John', 'Archer', 'who', 'was', 'beginning', 'career', 'would', 'eventually', 'span', '60', 'years', 'crash', 'island', 'discover', 'suspicious', 'happenings.We', 'soon', 'learn', 'admiral', 'missing', 'can', 'only', 'mean', 'one', 'thing', 'Yep', 'got', 'admiral', 'be', 'island', 'somewhere', 'local', 'guy', 'power', 'be', 'Dr.', 'Miklos', 'Sangre', 'Henry', 'Victor', 'who', 'appeared', 'many', 'spy', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'cult', 'classic', 'Freaks', 'assorted', 'house', 'guests', 'including', 'bevy', 'genuine', 'zombies', 'also', 'learn', 'Dr.', 'Sangre', 'attempting', 'use', 'voodoo', 'gain', 'secrets', 'admiral.Most', 'movie', 'was', 'bizarre', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'various', 'characters', 'did', 'things', 'did', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'movie', 'survivable', 'was', 'antics', 'Mantan', 'Moreland', 'beautiful', 'Marguerite', 'Whitten', 'Samantha', 'maid', 'actors', 'were', 'far', 'superior', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'Moreland', 'style', 'comedy', 'may', 'seem', 'step', 'too', 'closely', 'degrading', 'stereotypes', 'era', 'was', 'also', 'evident', 'servant', 'Jeff', 'Jackson', 'maid', 'Samantha', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'were', 'only', 'characters', 'smart', 'enough', 'stay', 'way', 'trouble', 'Moreland', 'lead', 'taking', 'zombies', 'dinner', 'easily', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'scene', 'showcased', 'talents', 'performers.My', 'first', 'impression', 'movie', 'tried', 'squeeze', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'short', 'length', 'have', 'Nazis', 'zombies', 'missing', 'admiral', 'love', 'story', 'crash', 'more', 'director', 'avoided', 'problem', 'caused', 'having', 'lot', 'plots', 'spending', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'developing', 'plots', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'missing', 'admiral', 'movie', 'seemed', 'wander', 'around', 'while', 'missing', 'admiral', 'got', 'very', 'little', 'face', 'time', 'end', 'movie', 'Even', 'watching', 'movie', 'most', 'memorable', 'portions', 'were', 'featuring', 'Moreland', 'Whitten', 'My', 'general', 'impression', 'movie', 'comedy', 'also', 'stuff', 'zombies', 'admiral', 'least', 'way', 'am', 'going', 'remember', 'movie.I', 'could', 'easily', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'worthless', 'nearly', 'However', 'scenes', 'Moreland', 'Whitten', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'Whitten', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'smooth', 'actress', 'who', 'commanded', 'role', 'Moreland', 'natural', 'comedian', 'presence', 'made', 'focus', 'scene', 'was', 'movie', 'rare', 'African', 'American', 'performers', 'were', 'lead', 'characters', 'several', 'scenes', 'Caucasian', 'performers', 'were', 'nominal', 'stars', 'movie', 'recommend', 'movie', 'presence', 'two', 'stars', 'However', 'be', 'aware', 'much', 'humor', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'unacceptable', 'today', 'standards.Before', 'forget', 'title', 'movie', 'borders', 'absurd', 'Dr.', 'Sangre', 'was', 'Nazi', 'experimenting', 'hypnosis', 'voodoo', 'was', 'far', 'King', 'Zombies', 'Sometimes', 'movie', 'titles', 'are', 'more', 'impressive', 'movies', 'themselves.Enjoy']",King of the Zombies
678324,A24MVVGNFVG68S,B00005R87N,Manfred Zeichmann,"[6, 10]","Although I am not a fan of vintage horror films I purchased KING OF THE ZOMBIES because of a very favorable review in a German movie magazine.The plot has an US secret agent, a pilot and their black servant crashland on a small Caribbean island. It turns out that the island is ruled by a German expatriot, who has kidnapped an American general and uses black magic Voodoo Mumbo Jumbo to get some military secrets out of the unfortunate high ranking officer. Of course the zombies of the title are not the flesh-eating ghouls of today's splatter films, but the living dead of Voodoo magic, will-less slaves of the Nazi, who uses them for his sinister plans. Will our heroes succeed in thwarting the Nazi's evil plan? Well, I do not want to give it away, so watch for yourself...Despite the unusual storyline involving espionage, a sinister Nazi, Voodoo and zombies, I found KING OF THE ZOMBIES rather dull and talky. (I am aware that fans of vintage horror will have a different view and likely rate it higher than I did.)Despite the brief running time of a little over an hour it drags in places. However black actor Mantan MORLAND was fun and his many funny lines will make you laugh throughout. While I am usually not into comedy, I found his performance a real joy to behold. Be aware that KING OF THE ZOMBIES shows his age. This is evident not only in the choice of the baddie as a German (owing to the propagandistic needs of the time), but also in a few of MORLAND's jokes, which are of a racial nature (like commenting his appearance, when he looks into a mirror, ""the tropics sure gives a man a colour""). Don't watch, if you dislike such jokes. However there is no doubt that MORLAND was a great actor. Were it not for him, this film would have been a complete waste of my time. I also liked actor Victor HENRY, who played the baddie. As usual in these films the heroes are bland and boring.The DVD is a bare-bones release, with no extras whatsoever. And don't expect picture quality to be as good as of a recent blockbuster movie.

The creases disappear with washing and the silk screening has stood up to five washes so far with no evidence of damage.

He's accompanied by the search plane pilot ""Mac"" (Dick Purcell) and his servant Jeff Jackson(Mantan Moreland).While searching, their own plane goes down and crashes into a cemetary on an island. They are taken into the residence by Dutch Dr. Sangre who claims to have fled there from the Nazis. He's accompanied by his wife who walks around in a trance-like state.Not only that, but there's several black zombies skulking about the creepy house that only Jeff ever seems to encounter. It's soon revealed that Dr. Sangre is a nazi conspirator who has the Admiral captured and is using a voodoo priestess to try and get sensitive military info out of him.Along the way Jeff get's ""Zombie-fied"" by the doctor in the movie's funniest bit. This film really seemed to be a vehicle for Lugosi in the role of the mad doctor Sangre but Henry Victor does an admirable job.Mantan steals the show with his one-liners and really brings some life to the film. Purcell is ok as the pilot but Archer is REALLY wooden as the would-be hero.Yes it is a bit racially stereotyped as Jeff his told that he cannot stay in a guest room and must instead stay with the other black servants. But instead of running it down lets rememeber the era that the film was made in. No one should much feel sorry for Mantan Moreland as he steals virtually every scene he's in.The film is no gem but has some fairly atmospheric creepiness and better than average Monogram film.",4,MANTAN MAKES THIS FUN MONOGRAM FARCE GO,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,1570,"['WWII', 'Govt', 'Agent', 'Bill', 'summers', 'John', 'Archer', 'searching', 'admiral', 'plan', 'went', 'down', 'somewhere', 'Caribbean', 'accompanied', 'search', 'plane', 'pilot', 'Mac', 'Dick', 'Purcell', 'servant', 'Jeff', 'Jackson', 'Mantan', 'Moreland', 'searching', 'own', 'plane', 'down', 'crashes', 'cemetary', 'island', 'are', 'taken', 'residence', 'Dutch', 'Dr.', 'Sangre', 'who', 'have', 'fled', 'there', 'Nazis', 'accompanied', 'wife', 'who', 'walks', 'around', 'trance-like', 'state.Not', 'only', 'several', 'black', 'zombies', 'skulking', 'creepy', 'house', 'only', 'Jeff', 'ever', 'encounter', 'soon', 'revealed', 'Dr.', 'Sangre', 'nazi', 'conspirator', 'who', 'Admiral', 'captured', 'using', 'voodoo', 'priestess', 'try', 'get', 'sensitive', 'military', 'info', 'him.Along', 'way', 'Jeff', 'get', 'Zombie-fied', 'doctor', 'movie', 'funniest', 'bit', 'film', 'really', 'seemed', 'be', 'vehicle', 'Lugosi', 'role', 'mad', 'doctor', 'Sangre', 'Henry', 'Victor', 'admirable', 'job.Mantan', 'show', 'one-liners', 'really', 'brings', 'life', 'film', 'Purcell', 'ok', 'pilot', 'Archer', 'REALLY', 'wooden', 'would-be', 'hero.Yes', 'bit', 'racially', 'stereotyped', 'Jeff', 'told', 'can', 'not', 'stay', 'guest', 'room', 'must', 'instead', 'stay', 'other', 'black', 'servants', 'instead', 'running', 'down', 'lets', 'rememeber', 'era', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'should', 'much', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Mantan', 'Moreland', 'virtually', 'scene', 'in.The', 'film', 'gem', 'fairly', 'atmospheric', 'creepiness', 'better', 'average', 'Monogram', 'film']",King of the Zombies
