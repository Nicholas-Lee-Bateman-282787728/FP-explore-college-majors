In this case the protagonist suffers from agoraphobia.A young couple are on the run. He has murdered someone who is now in the trunk of his car. She hasn't yet done anything wrong but has issues of self worth so she stays with this murderer. While they are at a gas station, and in need of dough, the news hits the TV that they are wanted. He ends up killing the attendant and they need to get off the street. They end up in the house of the agoraphobe and realize he is a source of their much needed cash. The movie shifts into psychological gear and the viewer must try to figure who will win the cat and mouse.Once you suspend your disbelief on the way too coincidental set up, this is a pretty cool movie. Steve Moyer as the shut in does a nice job. He's essentially a normal guy except for that one phobia. And when the viewer sees he might not be as innocent as he proposes he handles that with equal aplomb. Teresa Palmer as Dale is gorgeous. She's good. Maybe not great, but good enough to get the viewer through the role comfortably. I'm not too sure about bad boy Ron. Some aspects of his character were right on but something was wrong. I'm not certain if it was in the writing or his portrayal.Most of the action is set in the house and it's a good set. It's a mansion that is a bit past its prime but has a lot of personality. That the shut-in is a used-to-be art dealer helps as well. You have some nifty artwork scattered throughout the place. This has decent production values and moves along at a fair clip so you're not at all bored.

1166084,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001AIQ14A,trebe,"[2, 3]","The unusual developments after a home invasion, is the subject of Restraint (2008), an atmospheric tale of suspense, shot in Australia, directed by David Deennen, and written by Dave Warner.  There are some minor cultural quirks, but this intriguing drama centered on the evolving relationship of the three central characters, easily translates to other cultures.Ronald Beron (Travis Fimmel) and his stripper girlfriend Dale (Teresa Palmer) are on the run, with Dale's dead ex-employer in the trunk of their car.  When they stop for gas, an unfortunate attendant who sees the body, receives a shotgun blast.  With another homicide to their credit, the couple zips down a side road looking for a place to hide, and discovers a small house.  Inside, they find the owner, Andrew Shepard (Stephen Moyer), and intend to make him part of their escape plans, but run into a problem.  Andrew suffers from agoraphobia, an acute fear of the outdoors that prevents him from leaving his home.To save his life, Andrew proposes a scheme where the couple can acquire forty thousand dollars.  This would involve Dale impersonating Andrew's fianc&eacute; Gabrielle, in order to withdrawing cash from his bank, twenty thousand dollars at a time.  As Gabrielle is woman of some class and breeding, and Dale is somewhat unsophisticated working class type, carrying off this deception will require a slight makeover, to smooth over some of Dale's rough edges.The interaction between these three central characters is dynamic, constantly changing, and very compelling.  Ron and Dale are passionate lovers, however Dale is not shy about teasing Andy with her naked body.  Ron intends to squeeze as much as he can from Andrew, before he kills him, and is open to using Dale as a tool to achieve this end.  Although a victim, Andrew has some deep dark secrets, and some desperate plans of his own.The screenplay is tight, with hardly a wasted scene, and numerous little artistic touches, like slashed paintings, a pulverized pet, jazz music, and Ron's surrealistic confession.  The characters come off as being pretty consistent, and very real.  Travis Fimmel shines as Ron, the cheeky bad boy, with a mean nasty streak, who revels in being in control, and playing deadly games.  Stephen Moyer, is very convincing as the seemingly helpless Andrew, a man who seems to be a master at psychology, and whose mind is continuously planning and plotting.  Teresa Palmer (2:37) steals the show as Dale, who's uninhibited sexuality grabs your attention, as the character grows beyond her limits, before your very eyes.  Ms. Palmer appears to have a bright future.Matters proceed, building up to a tense finish, as Andrew makes desperate attempts to save himself.  Emotions swirl and come to the surface, producing some thrills, and unleashing violent surprises.  A gritty tale of suspense that is largely free from typical Hollywood clich&eacute;s, Restraint scores major points for being fresh, and mostly realistic.  While not perfect, the film is so much better by comparison, than most of the dreck that is out there.  Rife with sexual tension, this one is a winner.  The film features a solid cast in the few supporting roles, including Philip Holder as a nosy policeman.",5,"wickedly compelling Australian drama, with powerful performances by the three lead actors . . .",1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,3242,"['unusual', 'developments', 'home', 'invasion', 'subject', 'Restraint', '2008', 'atmospheric', 'tale', 'suspense', 'shot', 'Australia', 'directed', 'David', 'Deennen', 'written', 'Dave', 'Warner', 'are', 'minor', 'cultural', 'quirks', 'intriguing', 'drama', 'centered', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'easily', 'other', 'cultures.Ronald', 'Beron', 'Travis', 'Fimmel', 'stripper', 'girlfriend', 'Dale', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'are', 'run', 'Dale', 'dead', 'ex-employer', 'trunk', 'car', 'When', 'stop', 'gas', 'unfortunate', 'attendant', 'who', 'body', 'shotgun', 'blast', 'homicide', 'credit', 'couple', 'down', 'side', 'road', 'looking', 'place', 'hide', 'small', 'house', 'find', 'owner', 'Andrew', 'Shepard', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'intend', 'make', 'part', 'escape', 'plans', 'run', 'problem', 'Andrew', 'suffers', 'agoraphobia', 'acute', 'fear', 'outdoors', 'leaving', 'home.To', 'save', 'life', 'Andrew', 'scheme', 'where', 'couple', 'can', 'acquire', 'forty', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'would', 'involve', 'Dale', 'impersonating', 'Andrew', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Gabrielle', 'order', 'withdrawing', 'cash', 'bank', 'twenty', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'time', 'Gabrielle', 'woman', 'class', 'breeding', 'Dale', 'somewhat', 'unsophisticated', 'working', 'class', 'type', 'carrying', 'off', 'deception', 'will', 'require', 'slight', 'makeover', 'smooth', 'Dale', 'rough', 'edges.The', 'interaction', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'dynamic', 'constantly', 'changing', 'very', 'compelling', 'Ron', 'Dale', 'are', 'passionate', 'lovers', 'however', 'Dale', 'not', 'shy', 'teasing', 'Andy', 'naked', 'body', 'Ron', 'squeeze', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'Andrew', 'open', 'using', 'Dale', 'tool', 'achieve', 'end', 'victim', 'Andrew', 'deep', 'dark', 'secrets', 'desperate', 'plans', 'own.The', 'screenplay', 'tight', 'hardly', 'wasted', 'scene', 'numerous', 'little', 'artistic', 'touches', 'slashed', 'paintings', 'pulverized', 'pet', 'jazz', 'music', 'Ron', 'surrealistic', 'confession', 'characters', 'come', 'off', 'being', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'very', 'real', 'Travis', 'Fimmel', 'shines', 'Ron', 'cheeky', 'bad', 'boy', 'mean', 'nasty', 'streak', 'who', 'being', 'control', 'playing', 'deadly', 'games', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'very', 'convincing', 'seemingly', 'helpless', 'Andrew', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'master', 'psychology', 'mind', 'continuously', 'planning', 'plotting', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', '2:37', 'show', 'Dale', 'who', 'uninhibited', 'sexuality', 'grabs', 'attention', 'character', 'limits', 'very', 'eyes', 'Ms.', 'Palmer', 'have', 'bright', 'future.Matters', 'proceed', 'building', 'up', 'tense', 'finish', 'Andrew', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'save', 'Emotions', 'swirl', 'come', 'surface', 'producing', 'thrills', 'unleashing', 'violent', 'surprises', 'gritty', 'tale', 'suspense', 'largely', 'free', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Restraint', 'major', 'points', 'being', 'fresh', 'mostly', 'realistic', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'comparison', 'most', 'dreck', 'there', 'Rife', 'sexual', 'tension', 'one', 'winner', 'film', 'solid', 'cast', 'few', 'supporting', 'roles', 'including', 'Philip', 'Holder', 'nosy', 'policeman']",Restraint

Unique enough characters in a unique enough situation, especially with the hostage's phobia. Despite doing their performances well, it's WHAT they performed as the first half of the film that made it less enjoyable.The two ""antagonists"" were WAY too unrealistically unstable/bi-polar for the majority. There's random acts of humorous bonding between everyone, then random insults/threats, then random sexual tension BS including from the promiscuous chick who somehow has bouts of dramatic seriousness, to random bouts of emotional-ness from one of them to another, etc etc.But towards the end this finally starts to fade and take a stronger tone as the movie builds up to its finish. The finish, suffice it to say, has a decent 'twist' that makes the movie stand out a bit more on itself. But it's hard to say that it makes up for the back and forth personalities and such earlier.In the end, after a bit of thought however, I can see there's a lot of psychological themes and detailed imagery based on the human mind that were meant to be displayed because of all these chaotic things (especially the twist added in), but it just doesn't come together as well or as cleanly as it could've and leaves a mildly disjointed product instead of a more direct/blatant, beautiful piece of psychological art it could've been with a bit more focus and a bit less whipping around.",4,Review for movie Restraint,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,1454,"['Good', 'acting', 'top', 'props', ""'hostage"", 'Great', 'camera', 'work/camera', 'quality', 'Unique', 'enough', 'characters', 'unique', 'enough', 'situation', 'especially', 'hostage', 'phobia', 'doing', 'performances', 'well', 'WHAT', 'performed', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'made', 'less', 'enjoyable.The', 'two', 'antagonists', 'were', 'WAY', 'too', 'unrealistically', 'unstable/bi-polar', 'majority', 'random', 'acts', 'humorous', 'bonding', 'everyone', 'then', 'random', 'insults/threats', 'then', 'random', 'sexual', 'tension', 'BS', 'including', 'promiscuous', 'chick', 'who', 'somehow', 'bouts', 'dramatic', 'seriousness', 'random', 'bouts', 'emotional-ness', 'one', 'etc', 'etc.But', 'end', 'finally', 'fade', 'take', 'stronger', 'tone', 'movie', 'up', 'finish', 'finish', 'suffice', 'say', 'decent', ""'twist"", 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'hard', 'say', 'up', 'back', 'forth', 'personalities', 'such', 'end', 'bit', 'thought', 'however', 'can', 'see', 'lot', 'psychological', 'themes', 'detailed', 'imagery', 'based', 'human', 'mind', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'displayed', 'chaotic', 'things', 'especially', 'twist', 'added', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'cleanly', 'could', ""'ve"", 'mildly', 'disjointed', 'product', 'instead', 'more', 'direct/blatant', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'psychological', 'art', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'focus', 'bit', 'less', 'whipping', 'around']",Restraint

It's a little known Australian production, but proved (despite my initial misgivings) to be quite an effective thriller.A young couple comprising a hoodlum, Ron (Travis Fimmel) and his stripper girlfriend, Dale (Teresa Palmer) end up being on the run after Ron kills a gas station clerk. The pair find an imposing big house out in the country and decide the check it out, not realizing there's an occupant in the house. The man occupying the house is an agoraphobic (someone who fears going outside) and Andrew (Stephen Moyer) is soon taken hostage by the pair. This is where the fun/thrills begin as the three play a sort of cat-and-mouse game with some psychological and sexual tension between the couple and the hostage. Andrew appears to be sexually attracted to Dale and keeps commenting on her resemblance to his fiancee Gabrielle who has apparently jilted him. Ron, as dumb as he acts, is wise to this attraction and manipulates it to serve his own ends, but there's more to Andrew than he suspects.The tension  in the drama is credibly played out and most of the movie is actually set within the house itself - there's an element of unpredictability in the 'relationship' that forms between the three, at times Ron is beating up on Andrew, at others Andrew fights back, and then there are times when all three are acting all civilized (sharing a meal, dancing happily to some vintage jazz album). It's hard for the viewer to determine what exactly Andrew's motives are, and if Ron and Dale will be content with what is promised to them. Dale as portrayed by the sexy Teresa Palmer (there's a scene where she bares her behind and breasts, but there's no graphic scenes of sex) is the object of desire for both men, and this sexual tension is also well played out.Though this appears to be a low-budget production, my husband and I both felt the dialogue was well-written and the three main actors were credible in their roles. The only thing we felt was a letdown was the rather cliched ending, but on the whole, this is a nicely done psychological thriller.",4,Surprisingly good,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,2332,"['was', 'able', 'watch', 'instant', 'play', 'movie', 'rental', 'website', 'subscribe', 'only', 'reason', 'picked', 'was', 'because', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', ""HBO'sTrue"", 'Blood', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'HBO', 'Series', 'andTrue', 'Blood', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'HBO', 'Series', 'was', 'little', 'known', 'Australian', 'production', 'proved', 'initial', 'misgivings', 'be', 'quite', 'effective', 'thriller.A', 'young', 'couple', 'comprising', 'hoodlum', 'Ron', 'Travis', 'Fimmel', 'stripper', 'girlfriend', 'Dale', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'run', 'Ron', 'gas', 'station', 'clerk', 'pair', 'find', 'imposing', 'big', 'house', 'country', 'decide', 'check', 'out', 'not', 'realizing', 'occupant', 'house', 'man', 'occupying', 'house', 'agoraphobic', 'someone', 'who', 'going', 'Andrew', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'soon', 'taken', 'hostage', 'pair', 'where', 'fun/thrills', 'begin', 'three', 'play', 'sort', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'psychological', 'sexual', 'tension', 'couple', 'hostage', 'Andrew', 'be', 'sexually', 'attracted', 'Dale', 'commenting', 'resemblance', 'fiancee', 'Gabrielle', 'who', 'apparently', 'jilted', 'Ron', 'as', 'dumb', 'wise', 'attraction', 'serve', 'own', 'ends', 'more', 'Andrew', 'tension', 'drama', 'credibly', 'played', 'out', 'most', 'movie', 'actually', 'set', 'house', 'element', 'unpredictability', ""'relationship"", 'forms', 'three', 'times', 'Ron', 'beating', 'up', 'Andrew', 'others', 'Andrew', 'fights', 'back', 'then', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'three', 'are', 'acting', 'civilized', 'sharing', 'meal', 'dancing', 'happily', 'vintage', 'jazz', 'album', 'hard', 'viewer', 'determine', 'what', 'exactly', 'Andrew', 'motives', 'are', 'Ron', 'Dale', 'will', 'be', 'content', 'what', 'promised', 'Dale', 'portrayed', 'sexy', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'scene', 'where', 'behind', 'breasts', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'sex', 'object', 'desire', 'men', 'sexual', 'tension', 'also', 'well', 'played', 'out.Though', 'be', 'low-budget', 'production', 'husband', 'felt', 'dialogue', 'was', 'well-written', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'were', 'credible', 'roles', 'only', 'thing', 'felt', 'was', 'letdown', 'was', 'rather', 'cliched', 'ending', 'whole', 'nicely', 'done', 'psychological', 'thriller']",Restraint
