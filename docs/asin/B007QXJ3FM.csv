Don't take the version of some of the incidents in the movie as set in stone and representing exactly how things actually happened. As with all these types of movies, there is always some literary license given to tell the story. Just as with all witnesses, each have their own version of the facts. It tells the story and makes it work in the 1 1/2 hour time frame they had to tell it.The movie stops at The Book of the New Covenants which Ervil wrote behind bars before his death. That is only half the story. Some members of his family picked up where he left off with his death and continued to enforce blood atonement of those he listed in that book. If you are interested in the subject material of the Church of the Lamb of God, Ervil and his followers after Ervil died, I suggest reading Scott Anderson's book,The 4 O'Clock MurdersIt is well worth the price new or used. It is arguably the best single account of the sordid events after he died.

It's sad how some can be led by a clearly silly man into criminal activity who should by right be avoided and ignored. But that's the way the cookie crumbles.

If there is any redeeming quality (such as more than one &#34;A&#34; actor) then maybe 10 minutes more. Unfortunately this movie didn't make it past the 25 minute marker.This actually could have been a better movie if there was some build-up, character development & one or two explanations as to just why this &#34;prophet&#34; was so powerful. It was not believable as a cult-religious con/terrorist movie because there was way to understand any of the relationships -- almost immediately there are ordered hits on members of the own group for petty reasons. The multiple wives smiling serenely in the background. The prophet has 12 wives and over 40 children. This information is given in one sentence. In two scenes lasting about 30-45 seconds each, the prophet decides to take another wife -- a very young woman who is already in love with someone else -- and just by proclaiming it so, they are married.At one point the police who are trying to &#34;get&#34; LeBaron mention that his group has about 50 members. I was unsure how this worked out -- 12 wives, 40 children, plus himself, the man that was killed, the woman killer, a baby and the woman sitting serenely & in another scene, a 10-ish year old boy,  is already 58 -- and it seems reasonable to expect there are others who follow, otherwise, how or why does this man have any power?So the plot is just faulty and scattered all over the place. Obviously a made-for-TV movie. Perhaps it has just enough of the bare backbones for distracted stay at home moms and the unemployed. I just cannot imagine for the life of me, that this movie was ever in the box office.To watch this movie, the average person would need to get acquainted with some Latter Day Saint denominations, including the FLDS Church, who are famous for having multiple wives & being fairly prosperous. Getting some knowledge as to how men are evaluated to have more than one life and a higher position in the church is valuable in maybe trying to &#34;get&#34; this movie. Warren Jeffs is someone to google  (as he was the prophet of the Latter day Saints)  to maybe get an idea as to how this self-proclaimed prophet personality works.But, meh... that seems like an awful lot of work for a freebie AP movie.",1,Just couldn't get into this one,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,2291,"['give', 'movies', 'least', '20', 'minute', 'grace', 'period', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'such', 'more', 'one', '34', 'A', '34', 'actor', 'then', 'maybe', '10', 'minutes', 'more', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', '25', 'minute', 'marker.This', 'actually', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'build-up', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'two', 'explanations', 'just', 'why', '34', 'prophet', '34', 'was', 'so', 'powerful', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'cult-religious', 'con/terrorist', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'understand', 'relationships', 'almost', 'immediately', 'are', 'ordered', 'hits', 'members', 'own', 'group', 'petty', 'reasons', 'multiple', 'wives', 'smiling', 'serenely', 'background', 'prophet', '12', 'wives', '40', 'children', 'information', 'given', 'one', 'sentence', 'two', 'scenes', 'lasting', '30-45', 'seconds', 'prophet', 'take', 'wife', 'very', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'already', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'just', 'proclaiming', 'so', 'are', 'married.At', 'one', 'point', 'police', 'who', 'are', 'trying', '34', 'get', '34', 'LeBaron', 'mention', 'group', '50', 'members', 'was', 'unsure', 'how', 'worked', 'out', '12', 'wives', '40', 'children', 'man', 'was', 'killed', 'woman', 'killer', 'baby', 'woman', 'sitting', 'serenely', 'scene', '10-ish', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'already', '58', 'reasonable', 'expect', 'are', 'others', 'who', 'follow', 'otherwise', 'how', 'why', 'man', 'have', 'power', 'plot', 'just', 'faulty', 'scattered', 'place', 'Obviously', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'enough', 'bare', 'backbones', 'distracted', 'stay', 'home', 'moms', 'unemployed', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'life', 'movie', 'was', 'ever', 'box', 'office.To', 'watch', 'movie', 'average', 'person', 'would', 'need', 'get', 'acquainted', 'Latter', 'Day', 'Saint', 'denominations', 'including', 'FLDS', 'Church', 'who', 'are', 'famous', 'having', 'multiple', 'wives', 'being', 'fairly', 'prosperous', 'Getting', 'knowledge', 'how', 'men', 'are', 'evaluated', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'life', 'higher', 'position', 'church', 'valuable', 'maybe', 'trying', '34', 'get', '34', 'movie', 'Warren', 'Jeffs', 'someone', 'google', 'was', 'prophet', 'Latter', 'day', 'Saints', 'maybe', 'get', 'idea', 'how', 'self-proclaimed', 'prophet', 'personality', 'works.But', 'meh', 'awful', 'lot', 'work', 'freebie', 'AP', 'movie']",N/A
