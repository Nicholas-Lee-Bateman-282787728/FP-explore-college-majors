379201,A37PT3XX6SEXFM,630354200X,Exercisequeen,"[1, 2]",I just did this routine and found it extremely poorly cued compared to other dance/cardio routines I have done.  I think part of it is that it was shot in 1995 but she only gives you 2 chances to learn the steps and then it goes to tempo which is a very fast tempo.  The thing I found most offensive is that the cameraman was constantly focusing on Paula's FACE rather than her FEET while you were trying to learn the steps.  It is definitely a good cardio workout but I'll save my cardio on a better cued routine.,2,The Camera loves Paula,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,514,"['just', 'did', 'routine', 'found', 'extremely', 'poorly', 'cued', 'compared', 'other', 'dance/cardio', 'routines', 'have', 'done', 'think', 'part', 'was', 'shot', '1995', 'only', '2', 'chances', 'learn', 'steps', 'then', 'tempo', 'very', 'fast', 'tempo', 'thing', 'found', 'most', 'offensive', 'cameraman', 'was', 'constantly', 'focusing', 'Paula', 'FACE', 'rather', 'FEET', 'were', 'trying', 'learn', 'steps', 'definitely', 'good', 'cardio', ""'ll"", 'save', 'cardio', 'better', 'cued', 'routine']",Paula Abdul's Get Up And Dance!

With Paula you will warm up safely, WELL and PROPERLY - and then stretch out effectively - all in a fun, dance format. It's sheer genius!EASY TO UNDERSTAND:When the dance steps begin they are taught in a progression - slowly and then up to tempo. Paula cues very well in this DVD and she has her two backup dancers cue you as well. It is VERY easy to understand the movements. When I first learned this workout (years ago) I hit rewind on the ""tape"" and did the moves over several times until I ""got"" them.FUN HIP HOP DANCE MOVES:The moves are pretty uncomplicated - but they WILL take a little repetition to learn. It is well WORTH the practice because it's an energetic, REALLY GOOD workout. At the end you will do the entire choreography TWICE - working up a good sweat.After the final choreography there is a REALLY fun and silly cool down - but it does not end there. After the cool down there is some great stretching and some ab work too!**THIS DVD IS STILL TIMELY**I want to point out that even though this was made in the 1990's it is STILL timely - because the dancing is ""hip-hop"" which is never outdated.

379213,A3N0HBW8IP8CZQ,630354200X,"Melissa P. Cooper ""kymissyin""","[33, 34]","Paula Abdul--choreographer to the stars--and two of her colleagues lead a workout which will challenge your feet and leave you sweating. As far as I know, she's not a certified aerobics instructor, but she had Karen Voight serve as Fitness Consultant for this video, and that was good enough for me. She's taught dance routines for years.  Much of what she did for George Michael, Janet Jackson, and the guys from ZZTop probably involved getting them to relax and not worry over how goofy they felt when they couldn't get the steps the first time around.  She does spend some time talking about that before you begin this routine.  In the words of the customer service experts, she practiced good expectations management there.  So I wasn't surprised or disappointed that I couldn't get it all the first time, either.  Heck, I like a challenge!You can't do this if you're sleepy.  I've never tried it at 5:00am.  To me, it's more of a &quot;let's dance and have a party&quot; routine, and one I want to be fully awake for. And there are no modifications given for those who want or need a gentler routine. But this is an intermediate program, after all. I've found that if I didin't snap my neck all the way around, bend my knees too deeply, or jump--just raise my arms toward the ceiling and go up on my toes--then I was all right. I'd also encourage folks who want to keep their heart rate up to use a full range of motion dring the &quot;teaching&quot; segments of the routine and really lift their knees up during the &quot;march-it-outs.&quot; I found that even the &quot;YMCA cooldown&quot; (which is really goofy but fun, anyway!) can be aerobic if I made my moves bigger. If this sounds like too much work, then pick up a Kathy Smith or Donna Richardson video, practice the low-impact modifiers they teach, and come back to Paula's program later!Having given those caveats, I still think this is a great, fun, inspiring workout. Paula is beautiful and she's passionate about dancing.  This tape is her way of making some of that accessible to the masses. You've gotta love her for that! One exerciser is 42, another is 50--so it's not all 20-somethings. I knew going in that it would take consistent practice to master the dance steps. After a month, I had most of them learned, and abandoned my &quot;modifications&quot; to really go for it. I'm also glad to see an aerobics tape which includes abdominal floor work after the cooldown. If I do ab stuff even a little bit following an all-out cardio routine, my back usually benefits from the stretching and muscle work, too.  The most important things are to not get discouraged if you can't get all the steps down in a week or two, and as Paula says, &quot;don't give up&quot; and &quot;have a great time!&quot;  I didn't and I did.

She encourages the viewer to pause the tape and practice the steps. So, it is not a workout to go straight through the first time or maybe the first few times.
