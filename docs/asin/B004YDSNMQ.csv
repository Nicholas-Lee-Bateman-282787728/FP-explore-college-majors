Greg Kinnear totally outdid himself. I've never seen him shine like this in a movie before. And Katie Holmes, though some complained about her acting, I thought did a beautiful job as Jackie. Barry Pepper (as Bobby)- what a transformation from the character he played on 'Like Dandelion Dust'. He's very versatile in his looks, and man, can he act! The ending, obviously known, is emotional. I wasn't expecting to feel that attached, but it was hard to watch.

1433162,A216EZY2WW3GZP,B004YDSNMQ,"Annette Mackey ""Author""","[0, 0]","This is a three disk collection containing a total of eight episodes, each about 45 minutes in length. Over all the series is very well done. I give it five stars. There might be a quibble here or there with a few historical details, but nothing too dramatic. I was, however, disappointed by how many things were not included. The last two episodes in particular rush through some of the most important historical events during JFK's presidency. I would liked to have seen this as a ten episode series, but I guess it's better to be left wanting more, rather than less.Below is a synopsis of each episode, which may contain spoilers.Episode One: Joe's Revenge Hour I: This first disk is where we meet the family. We quickly learn that Joe Kennedy had early aspirations for the presidency, but loses the opportunity through mistakes he made as ambassador. In his stead, Joe Junior plans to fulfill his father's dream. Obviously that doesn't happen and the obligation falls to Jack.Episode Two: Joe's Revenge Hour II: Jack has just been elected president, but is still living under his father's thumb. In flashbacks we learn that Jack had no initial aspiration to become president. He campaigns without heart to please his father until he finally finds his voice. It's a beautiful moment, and I found myself wishing I had been there. The flaws of the Kennedy family are portrayed in various roles, particularly that of unfaithful husbands.Episode Three: Us Against Them: This is the episode where Jack makes his famous big blunder, the Bay of Pigs. It opens just before the inauguration. Rose Kennedy asks her daughter-in-law, Jackie, who has recently had a baby, what she will wear to the inauguration. Jackie mentions that she has eight weeks to get her figure back, and Rose snubs her by saying that it only took her four. (Oh, to be a woman.) We also see Joe Senior's influence continue. Joe insists that Bobby become Attorney General.  Jack tells his father that Bobby doesn't want to be Attorney General, and Joe responds, ""Well, I want it for him."" And that's that.Episode Four: Who's In Charge Here: Joe dabbles in the mob with both feet out of the pond. As Attorney General, clean-cut Bobby attacks the mob head-on. Sound like trouble? It is. Once again the presidency becomes off-limits to Joe, all the while the Berlin Wall goes up. Jack continues to battle health problems, particularly the old injuries he sustained during World War II.Episode Five: Life Sentences: The civil rights movement is in full swing, though it isn't swinging smooth. Lindon Johnson seems to be the only cabinet member able to communicate with southern politicians. As the presidency prepares to support James Meredith's enrollment at Old Miss, as ordered by the Supreme Court, Joe suffers a debilitating stroke. The family members are left reeling as they try to cope with their unresolved feelings. Rose, in particular, is burdened by troubling memories. Simultaneously, law and order dissolve in Missouri as a near civil war atmosphere engulfs the university and threatens the state.Episode Six: The Brink: Jack's indiscretions cause Jackie deep pain. She takes a trip to Virginia with the children just before the Cuban Missel crisis begins. Tensions run high as the entire cabinet works together to prevent disaster. This is truly JFK's finest moment, and true to form, Bobby is continuously at his side. Ethel and Jackie have a candid conversation, and Jackie returns to the White House as Jack brings the country safely through what could have easily become a nuclear war.Episode Seven: Lancer and Lace: The episode opens with Walter Cronkite telling the world that the president is dead. The rest of the episode leads up to that point. Jack's affair with Marilyn Monroe is referenced, and as usual, Bobby is stuck cleaning up the mess. Jack commits more definitively to Jackie prior to the assassination, which is left to the imagination, or memory, and the families reaction to Jack's death is explored.Episode Eight: Bobby picks up where Jack left off, protecting Jackie as if she were a blood relative. Jackie eventually remarries, stating the need to keep her children safe. Bobby is determined to carry on in politics, and becomes a presidential candidate. When the polls show him out of favor he turns to his mother for political backing. He begins to rise in the polls only to be assassinated a short time later. As he is dying he asks Ethel, ""Was anyone else hurt?"" And that's the end of Bobby. With such a gruesome end to the tale, the episode closes by going through some enthusiastic scenes that leave the viewer feeling like everything is fine.",5,Enjoyed it,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,4650,"['three', 'disk', 'collection', 'containing', 'total', 'eight', 'episodes', '45', 'minutes', 'length', 'series', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'might', 'be', 'quibble', 'here', 'there', 'few', 'historical', 'details', 'nothing', 'too', 'dramatic', 'was', 'however', 'disappointed', 'how', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'particular', 'rush', 'most', 'important', 'historical', 'events', 'JFK', 'presidency', 'would', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'ten', 'episode', 'series', 'guess', 'better', 'be', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'rather', 'less.Below', 'synopsis', 'episode', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers.Episode', 'One', 'Joe', 'Revenge', 'Hour', 'first', 'disk', 'where', 'meet', 'family', 'quickly', 'learn', 'Joe', 'Kennedy', 'had', 'early', 'aspirations', 'presidency', 'opportunity', 'mistakes', 'made', 'ambassador', 'stead', 'Joe', 'Junior', 'fulfill', 'father', 'dream', 'Obviously', ""n't"", 'happen', 'obligation', 'Jack.Episode', 'Two', 'Joe', 'Revenge', 'Hour', 'II', 'Jack', 'just', 'been', 'elected', 'president', 'still', 'living', 'father', 'thumb', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'Jack', 'had', 'initial', 'aspiration', 'become', 'president', 'heart', 'please', 'father', 'finally', 'voice', 'beautiful', 'moment', 'found', 'wishing', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'flaws', 'Kennedy', 'family', 'are', 'portrayed', 'various', 'roles', 'particularly', 'unfaithful', 'husbands.Episode', 'Three', 'Us', 'Them', 'episode', 'where', 'Jack', 'famous', 'big', 'blunder', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'just', 'inauguration', 'Rose', 'Kennedy', 'daughter-in-law', 'Jackie', 'who', 'recently', 'had', 'baby', 'what', 'will', 'wear', 'inauguration', 'Jackie', 'mentions', 'eight', 'weeks', 'get', 'figure', 'back', 'Rose', 'snubs', 'saying', 'only', 'took', 'four', 'Oh', 'be', 'woman', 'also', 'see', 'Joe', 'Senior', 'influence', 'continue', 'Joe', 'Bobby', 'become', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Jack', 'father', 'Bobby', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Joe', 'Well', 'want', 'that.Episode', 'Four', 'Who', 'Charge', 'Here', 'Joe', 'dabbles', 'mob', 'feet', 'pond', 'Attorney', 'General', 'clean-cut', 'Bobby', 'mob', 'head-on', 'Sound', 'trouble', 'Once', 'again', 'presidency', 'off-limits', 'Joe', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'up', 'Jack', 'battle', 'health', 'problems', 'particularly', 'old', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'World', 'War', 'II.Episode', 'Five', 'Life', 'Sentences', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'full', 'swing', ""n't"", 'swinging', 'smooth', 'Lindon', 'Johnson', 'be', 'only', 'cabinet', 'member', 'able', 'communicate', 'southern', 'politicians', 'presidency', 'support', 'James', 'Meredith', 'enrollment', 'Old', 'Miss', 'ordered', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Joe', 'debilitating', 'stroke', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'left', 'reeling', 'try', 'cope', 'unresolved', 'feelings', 'Rose', 'particular', 'burdened', 'troubling', 'memories', 'Simultaneously', 'law', 'order', 'dissolve', 'Missouri', 'near', 'civil', 'war', 'atmosphere', 'university', 'state.Episode', 'Six', 'Brink', 'Jack', 'indiscretions', 'cause', 'Jackie', 'deep', 'pain', 'trip', 'Virginia', 'children', 'just', 'Cuban', 'Missel', 'crisis', 'Tensions', 'run', 'high', 'entire', 'cabinet', 'together', 'prevent', 'disaster', 'truly', 'JFK', 'finest', 'moment', 'true', 'form', 'Bobby', 'continuously', 'side', 'Ethel', 'Jackie', 'have', 'candid', 'conversation', 'Jackie', 'returns', 'White', 'House', 'Jack', 'country', 'safely', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'become', 'nuclear', 'war.Episode', 'Seven', 'Lancer', 'Lace', 'episode', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'telling', 'world', 'president', 'dead', 'rest', 'episode', 'up', 'point', 'Jack', 'affair', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'referenced', 'usual', 'Bobby', 'stuck', 'cleaning', 'up', 'mess', 'Jack', 'more', 'definitively', 'Jackie', 'prior', 'assassination', 'left', 'imagination', 'memory', 'families', 'reaction', 'Jack', 'death', 'explored.Episode', 'Eight', 'Bobby', 'up', 'where', 'Jack', 'left', 'off', 'protecting', 'Jackie', 'were', 'blood', 'relative', 'Jackie', 'eventually', 'stating', 'need', 'keep', 'children', 'safe', 'Bobby', 'determined', 'carry', 'politics', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'When', 'polls', 'show', 'favor', 'mother', 'political', 'backing', 'rise', 'polls', 'only', 'be', 'assassinated', 'short', 'time', 'later', 'dying', 'Ethel', 'Was', 'anyone', 'else', 'hurt', 'end', 'Bobby', 'gruesome', 'end', 'tale', 'episode', 'closes', 'going', 'enthusiastic', 'scenes', 'leave', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'everything', 'fine']",The Kennedys

The discs themselves were not that great and did not play in all my DVDs.  Also, there are no subtitles, and although I am not hearing-impaired, I like subtitles because I like to get every word, and this is not always possible with the audio.I also don't know why Barry Pepper (Bobby Kennedy) had to wear a protheses nose.  To me, the nose made him look less like Bobby Kennedy.  I learned this from the one special feature which was included.  But all the main characters - John, Joe, Bobby, Rose, and even Jacqueline - I thought the acting was great and very true to the historical figures they were interpreting.  This is a great miniseries, and if the discs were produced at a higher quality, and with more features, like subtitles and commentary, like ""real"" DVDs, I would give it 5 stars.

Jack always looking so grim,the way he as played it was like was with no charm or humor. Where was his famous sense of humor - his charm or grace. The way he was plyed it was like he had a migraine throughout the production. I give GK snaps for his accent though. It was not too bad In the real films of Jack we see him SMILING in the car in Dallas- in this show we see him looking pretty cranky.Katie Holmes did NOT capture the mystique of Jackie. Her accent seemed straight out of Brooklyn and the crooked ""smile"" ? Jackie had a breathy, soft voice with a combination of NY and Virginia accents.I know she is married to Tom Cruise so I suppose that is why the oh wow's over her performance.I was also distracted by the makeup - I could not get away from the white eye shadow - and the relationship between her and Jack. you never got WHY she married Jack, in this depiction she was always staring into space wondering why she was there. I wondered too. The real Jackie  was besotted with him - she had a way about her as a iron fist in a velvet glove and got what she wanted. Where was the renovation of the white house also.And Ethel the ""gee kids lets put on a show"" attitude? Ethel, was never anything like that, critical, and harsh. That's Ethel. She and Jackie did NOT get alongRose- crying all the time? Rose had a back of icy steel, she worshiped Joe, and that scene about Rosemary? I doubt VERY MUCH if Rose went off like. Rose had a cold distant connection to her children. She was more of an administrator than a mother. I do not doubt that she loved them but this lady who played her - Rose did NOT display emotion and if you have read her writings she firmly believed in control of her emotions.I am not sure who says this is an accurate rendition of the Kennedys-Where was the fun the humor on their interactions. They were close as could be and had an intricate relationship.I hate it that they got this so wrong when there was tons of documentation and and archive of resources to study these people.I find the story of Jackie, Ethel and Joan in Camelot a better rendition of these people.I would not be so harsh at this series if I did not know there would be people who will view this as a set of facts.

1433174,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B004YDSNMQ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[67, 80]","""The Kennedys"" caused a big stir before it was even aired, since the History Channel refused to air it, allegedly because it was a smear job.Well, it wasn't a smear job, and reportedly the History Channel pulled out because the Kennedys put pressure on them. But it also wasn't the great American epic that you would expect -- its stately beginning and exploration of the world-changing effects of the Kennedy administration are marred by a rushed ending and lackluster direction.The miniseries follows the Kennedy family as John F. Kennedy (Greg Kinnear) is elected as the President of the United States, with the help of his bombastic father Joe Sr. (Tom Wilkinson) and his devoted brother Bobby (Barry Pepper). But JFK had many obstacles, both personal and professional -- he's crippled by a bad back, his father made many enemies, and his marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy (Katie Holmes) was troubled.And over the course of his administration, the Kennedy brothers grapple with Cuba, Russia, riots over civil rights for African-Americans, and chasing down the mob. But there are also many personal crises -- drug use, a baby's death, Joe Sr.'s stroke -- that they struggle to deal with, until the shocking assassinations that destroyed both men.First off: is ""The Kennedys"" a smear job? Answer: no, it is not. However, it contains a lot of material that the Kennedy family doesn't like to publicize despite its truth: Rosemary Kennedy's lobotomy, the frequent infidelity by Joe Sr. and Jack, the First Family's drug use, and the fact that Joe Sr. wasn't above using crooked associations to get what he wanted.However, the miniseries is a fair and sympathetic look at the Kennedy clan overall. The first five episodes are slow, stately and careful, outlining some of the major events of the Kennedy administration, and adding in flashbacks to show some of the family's history (such as the death of Joe Jr.). It's actually pretty amusing, although the direction is pretty lackluster, and painfully maudlin during emotional moments.However, about five episodes in, the producers seemed to suddenly realize, ""Yikes, we have only a few hours to wrap everything up! We'll have to smush everything to make it fit!"" The last few episodes are HORRIBLY rushed -- the Marilyn affair takes up about ten minutes max (with no ""happy birthday"" song), and Bobby's entire presidential campaign is squashed into the final twenty minutes. The poor guy deserved more than that.As for the actors, they're a mixed bag. Wilkinson and Diana Hardcastle are absolutely pitch-perfect as Joe and Rose Kennedy. Pepper and Kinnear don't look anything like their real-life counterparts, but they both give good performances -- Pepper is particularly good as the devout ""good boy"" who struggles to do the right thing, and he is the saving grace of the last two episodes.The worst part, hands down? That would be Katie Holmes, who doesn't have the elegance, poise or grace to play Jacqueline Kennedy. And she has only three acting modes: pouty, smiley and blank.""The Kennedys"" is certainly a miniseries worth watching, especially since it highlights part of the Kennedy family's past that are often left unilluminated. But that doesn't mean it couldn't have used another two episodes and a better Jackie.",3,"Tale of a family... or at least, the major parts",1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,3281,"['Kennedys', 'caused', 'big', 'stir', 'was', 'even', 'aired', 'History', 'Channel', 'refused', 'air', 'allegedly', 'was', 'smear', 'job.Well', 'was', ""n't"", 'smear', 'job', 'reportedly', 'History', 'Channel', 'pulled', 'out', 'Kennedys', 'put', 'pressure', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'American', 'epic', 'would', 'expect', 'stately', 'beginning', 'exploration', 'world-changing', 'effects', 'Kennedy', 'administration', 'are', 'marred', 'rushed', 'ending', 'lackluster', 'direction.The', 'miniseries', 'Kennedy', 'family', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'elected', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'help', 'bombastic', 'father', 'Joe', 'Sr.', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'devoted', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'JFK', 'had', 'many', 'obstacles', 'personal', 'professional', 'crippled', 'bad', 'back', 'father', 'made', 'many', 'enemies', 'marriage', 'Jacqueline', 'Bouvier', 'Kennedy', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'was', 'troubled.And', 'course', 'administration', 'Kennedy', 'brothers', 'grapple', 'Cuba', 'Russia', 'civil', 'rights', 'African-Americans', 'chasing', 'down', 'mob', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'personal', 'crises', 'drug', 'use', 'baby', 'death', 'Joe', 'Sr.', 'stroke', 'struggle', 'deal', 'shocking', 'assassinations', 'destroyed', 'men.First', 'off', 'Kennedys', 'smear', 'job', 'Answer', 'not', 'However', 'lot', 'material', 'Kennedy', 'family', ""n't"", 'like', 'publicize', 'truth', 'Rosemary', 'Kennedy', 'lobotomy', 'frequent', 'infidelity', 'Joe', 'Sr.', 'Jack', 'First', 'Family', 'drug', 'use', 'fact', 'Joe', 'Sr.', 'was', ""n't"", 'using', 'crooked', 'associations', 'get', 'what', 'wanted.However', 'miniseries', 'fair', 'sympathetic', 'look', 'Kennedy', 'clan', 'overall', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'are', 'slow', 'stately', 'careful', 'outlining', 'major', 'events', 'Kennedy', 'administration', 'adding', 'flashbacks', 'show', 'family', 'history', 'such', 'death', 'Joe', 'Jr.', 'actually', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'direction', 'pretty', 'lackluster', 'painfully', 'maudlin', 'emotional', 'moments.However', 'about', 'five', 'episodes', 'producers', 'seemed', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'Yikes', 'have', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', ""'ll"", 'have', 'smush', 'everything', 'make', 'fit', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'HORRIBLY', 'rushed', 'Marilyn', 'affair', 'up', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'max', 'happy', 'birthday', 'song', 'Bobby', 'entire', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'squashed', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'poor', 'guy', 'deserved', 'more', 'that.As', 'actors', ""'re"", 'mixed', 'bag', 'Wilkinson', 'Diana', 'Hardcastle', 'are', 'absolutely', 'pitch-perfect', 'Joe', 'Rose', 'Kennedy', 'Pepper', 'Kinnear', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'real-life', 'counterparts', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'Pepper', 'particularly', 'good', 'devout', 'good', 'boy', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'saving', 'grace', 'last', 'two', 'episodes.The', 'worst', 'part', 'down', 'would', 'be', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'elegance', 'poise', 'grace', 'play', 'Jacqueline', 'Kennedy', 'only', 'three', 'acting', 'modes', 'pouty', 'smiley', 'blank', 'Kennedys', 'certainly', 'miniseries', 'watching', 'especially', 'part', 'Kennedy', 'family', 'past', 'are', 'often', 'left', 'unilluminated', ""n't"", 'mean', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'used', 'two', 'episodes', 'better', 'Jackie']",The Kennedys

Having watched the first three episodes, I have to say it just isn't that great.  Although some things do come out that weren't in the public domain, the production values disappoint at every turn.  The characters seem wooden caricatures of their parts - Greg Kinnear does a decent job portraying JFK, and Katie Holmes does her best with Jackie - they even do an okay job with the accents.  But when it's obvious that Kinnear is sporting a wig that sometimes doesn't want to stay put, the video loses a great deal in credibility.  I have to admit there are times when Kinnear does a star turn with a pose, or gesture, that calls to mind a photograph or video clip the viewer has seen (I shook JFK's hand during his election stopover in Cincinnati many years ago), I put that down to excellent research on somebody's part trying to invest the show with some realism.  We'll watch the rest of the series, and I may update this review after.- - -The series picks up in production values and acting in the fourth (and subsequent episodes).  Overall, it's definitely worth watching (although if you can catch it on cable or through NetFlix, so much the better).  The makeup, especially Kinnear's wig, is much, much better as the series develops.  I won't go into as much detail as the other reviews - how many times do you want to read the same things?  Sure, a lot is skipped over, and they could have continued the family story with Ted and Mary Jo Kopechne - in fact, Ted appears nowhere in this series - but we'll possibly watch the series again some time in the future.

JFK's liason were glossed over, portraying Marilyn Monroe as a mentally unbalanced stalker. RFK was portrayed as a saint, drinking only Dr. Pepper and totally faithful to Ethel. Ethel was depicted as some housewife driving car pools instead of the real woman who simply popped out babies in competition with Rose. I actually felt Katie Holmes did a decent job with her portrayal of Jackie. The whispery voice was close to accurate but little was done to show her redecorating of the white house or the fact that her spendthrift ways was a source of friction between her and Jack. Joseph and Rose Kennedy were probably pretty accurately depicted. From what I've read elsewhere, Rose was pretty cold with her religion taking center stage and indeed influencing her apparent lack of grief over the loss of several children.I don't know if the Kennedy's had any say in how this movie was done.

1433188,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004YDSNMQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","In one of the most patently absurd manufactured controversies of this or any year, the History Channel commissioned this dramatized portrait of the Kennedy clan and then bowed to outside pressure not to air it. Other networks soon passed on the finished product, and this television production was all but demonized before it even saw the light of day. What exactly has this miniseries been found guilty of? It plays fast and loose with some of the facts? Well, this isn't a documentary, that's for sure--but who expected it would be? As a superficial and fictional presentation, it is not the least bit surprising that elements of the story are emphasized for entertainment purposes. This is a dramatization, not unlike dozens of others that populate feature films and TV movies, that embellishes its story to fit a certain format. Are the Kennedys really that untouchable? As fodder for countless films, TV shows, and novels through the years (perhaps more so than any other family in history), the Kennedy story has been covered from almost every angle--from reverential to scurrilous. Anyone who is scandalized by ""The Kennedys"" must surely have had their head in the sand about the clan. I have viewed and read dozens of far more incendiary provocations over the last 30 years!If anything, this miniseries is guilty of being an old fashioned TV product--a throw back to the days before cable ruled the adult viewing audience. In fact, for that reason alone, the presentation is surprisingly tepid--in other hands, this might have been turned into a piece worthy of controversy. Okay, I promise to get off my soapbox now and talk about the actual film. Shot in eight bite sized nuggets (I mean episodes), ""The Kennedys"" does not purport to be a comprehensive biography. Each episode tends to have a central theme or plot point and hits the appropriate historical markers with precision. It is not an in-depth look at either history or politics, but rather a glossy overview of recognizable historical moments amidst soap opera turmoil. It is an entertaining, if superficial, peak at the intricacies inherent in being involved as a power player in media and politics.Far more intriguing than the paint by numbers romp through history is the cast. Tom Wilkinson is absolutely magnetic as family patriarch Joe. Had this aired on a network other than Reelz, there is no doubt in my mind that he would have been under greater awrad scrutiny. Fiery, uncompromising, meticulous, and riddled with ambition--this is a star turn from one of our best actors. Diana Hardcastle, as matriarch Rose, doesn't have as much screen time--but hers is an equally vivid performance. A fine combination of haughty and devout, I think I laughed at just about everything she says--a true scene stealing role. Greg Kinnear acquits himself well handling the complexities of JFK while Barry Pepper turns in a terrific performance as Bobby. Only Katie Holmes (and I'm not a hater) falls a bit short, for my taste, with the overly breathy Jackie. The supporting cast is enlivened by some solid turns and famous faces. Sinatra, Monroe, Hoover, and Giancana (among others) are all nicely done.""The Kennedys,"" again while capitalizing on more colorful aspects of the story, never commits the sin of being dull. And, in truth, that's its greatest accomplishment. The story is so familiar, I was hesitant to revisit yet another tale of America's First Family. But I'm glad I did--mainly for the able and game cast who really seem to come across as related. A special mention goes out to the make-up team--with slight modifications, Pepper and Kinnear look the part while still being recognizable. If you go into this thinking it will be ""too hot for TV,"" you'll likely be disappointed. This is a classic network TV style miniseries that is well done.

I am fascinated by all documentaries, movies and news about this period in history because I am a boomer child. Remove the historical label from this entertaining series and you witness some great acting by Greg Kinnear, Tom Wilkinson, Barry Pepper, Katie Holmes and the actress that portrayed Rose Kennedy.Despite the controversy it had finding a distributor, ""The Kennedys"" walk away with a batch of nominations and took home a Best Actor Emmy for Barry Pepper amongst other awards.But there are a couple of shocking scenes that challenges what you may have known about this beloved First Family. In the 80s, the criminal white trash government of Ronald and Nancy ""wet rat"" Reagan would have had you believe that they brought back the elegance and glamour of the Camelot Presidency. Nothing could be further from the truth. Katie Holmes as the elegant Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy was more believable than Nancy""wet rat"" Reagan could ever be. But the liberties this mini series took even about First Lady, Kennedy, are pretty shocking but riveting as tawdry entertainment. Tom Wilkinson burns the screen with a searing portrayal of the sometimes not very likable but highly effective, Joseph Kennedy Sr. Barry Pepper engulfed the role of Bobby Kennedy to the highest degree. Katie Holmes' acting is a little more debatable. But I enjoy it and felt that she reminded me enough of our beloved First Lady that I feel a little differently about her as an actress.Questions are left unanswered. Marilyn Monroe looked pathetic and almost unsympathetic. It was yet another shocking turn that was at once absurd and on another cheaply captivating.Applause to the still fringe, Reelz Channel for acquiring rights to this highly entertaining mini series. What the priceless as acountry belies that this is a cognitive dissonance to get such acknowledgment from the Emmys to help put their channel on the map.

The Kennedy family eventually brought enough pressure that the history channel declined to air it. And so did most of the large American television outlets. That the Kennedy family has the power to ban a mini-series is a sad comment on modern America. And after finally seeing it, its very difficult to understand why they even cared.Its not exactly controversial. Its really old fashioned and its fault (if anything) is that it takes itself too seriously. But it says nothing about the Kennedy family that has not been said before in many other places. And its also often well acted. While it takes liberties with documented history at times, it doesn't do so in a mean or nasty way. And it doesn't break any new ground.Tom Wilkinson gives an outstanding performance as Joe Kennedy. Its certainly the best performance of 2011 on television. Greg Kinnear is ok, but nothing special.Those looking for scandal will probably be bored.

1433201,A9ETYHQDJLAHZ,B004YDSNMQ,Martin L,"[7, 23]","Intending to ignore the many critics' reviews panning this mini-series, I plunked down the money with an open mind.  I should have been warned when a sticker on the box indicated that the notorious tabloid ""New York Post"" hailed this as one of the most historically accurate mini-series ever.  Having lived through many of these events as well as an avid reader of multiple scholarly works on the era, I can only agree with those who contend that this was, indeed,  a right wing hit job.  Certainly the History Channel was correct in rejecting this ""dramatization"" --it certainly was not historically accurate---especially in its depiction of JFK's actions during the Cuban Missile Crisis---but I digress.The producers of this mini-series did stress that it is not a documentary, but absent its historical accuracy--it does commit the mortal sin of not being very entertaining.  Aside from the scene stealing acting of Tom Wilkinson as Joseph P. Kennedy, everyone else in the cast portrays their respective characters as pretty self loathing creatures. And in fact, after watching all of these episodes, the viewer ends up not liking these characters either.  And that would seem to be the intended effect of putting the darkest and most sinister spin on the character and the motives of JFK, Jackie, Bobby and just about the entire Kennedy clan.There's no question that Joseph P. Kennedy was a very unlikeable fellow and that he pushed his sons into public service.  But is seems that until his stroke in 1961--the series would have you believe that the two Kennedy brothers (I guess Teddy never did exist after all) cleared every decision through daddy--including ALL cabinet selections. In fact, it seems that through every event depicted--the Bay of Pigs; James Meredith's admission to Ole Miss; the Cuban Missle Crisis------JFK seems to be an timid, drug addled, intellectually over matched bystander.After almost 50 years, there's little about John F. Kennedy that we don't know--including his philandering  as well as his illnesses ----and the authors of the mini-series seem to make his moral failings the central theme of this work. Kennedy was certainly an imperfect human being---as were all of the men who served the office---but it is no myth that he lead us through some of the most dangerous and tumultuous times in the history of this country.  And in regards to his fellow presidents who were considered loyal family men---the marital fidelity of Nixon and George W. Bush were never questioned---but both were disasters as Presidents and turned out to be two of the worst crooks in the history of the office--but in both cases, those facts would fill an encyclopedia.In regards to the Cuban Missile Crisis--after the release of files in the US, the former Soviet Union and Cuba over the last forty-nine years--as well as the Kennedy tapes---we know more now about how dangerous that era was as well as Kennedy's leadership throughout the entire thirteen days.  The writers of this mini-series make it clear that this crisis was Kennedy's fault--because of his own so called ""weak kneed"" decisions regarding the Bay of Pigs fiasco. And once the Cuban Missle Crisis was underway---Kennedy seems to be a freightened bystander--overwhelmed by events.Over the last 25 or 30 years--conservatives (and particularly ""neo conservatives"") have been busy at work, attempting to rewrite history to suit their own world view---everything from blaming FDR for the Depression to blaming JFK for the events during his administration to re-writing the Bush Administration's involvement in the Iraqi war and the economic meltdown of 2008.  But facts are stubborn things---and ""artistic license"" only allows just so much diversion from the truth.So don't take this ""docu-drama"" for more than it is.",1,Over Six hours of Tedium,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,3796,"['Intending', 'ignore', 'many', 'critics', 'reviews', 'panning', 'mini-series', 'plunked', 'down', 'money', 'open', 'mind', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'when', 'sticker', 'box', 'indicated', 'notorious', 'tabloid', 'New', 'York', 'Post', 'hailed', 'one', 'most', 'historically', 'accurate', 'mini-series', 'ever', 'Having', 'lived', 'many', 'events', 'as', 'well', 'avid', 'reader', 'multiple', 'scholarly', 'works', 'era', 'can', 'only', 'agree', 'who', 'contend', 'was', 'indeed', 'right', 'wing', 'hit', 'job', 'Certainly', 'History', 'Channel', 'was', 'correct', 'rejecting', 'dramatization', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', '-especially', 'depiction', 'JFK', 'actions', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', '-but', 'digress.The', 'producers', 'mini-series', 'did', 'stress', 'not', 'documentary', 'absent', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'commit', 'mortal', 'sin', 'not', 'being', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Aside', 'scene', 'stealing', 'acting', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Joseph', 'P.', 'Kennedy', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'respective', 'characters', 'pretty', 'self', 'loathing', 'creatures', 'fact', 'watching', 'episodes', 'viewer', 'up', 'not', 'liking', 'characters', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'intended', 'effect', 'putting', 'darkest', 'most', 'sinister', 'spin', 'character', 'motives', 'JFK', 'Jackie', 'Bobby', 'just', 'entire', 'Kennedy', 'clan.There', 'question', 'Joseph', 'P.', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'fellow', 'pushed', 'sons', 'public', 'service', 'stroke', '1961', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'two', 'Kennedy', 'brothers', 'guess', 'Teddy', 'never', 'did', 'exist', 'cleared', 'decision', 'daddy', 'including', 'cabinet', 'selections', 'fact', 'event', 'depicted', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'James', 'Meredith', 'admission', 'Ole', 'Miss', 'Cuban', 'Missle', 'Crisis', 'JFK', 'be', 'timid', 'drug', 'addled', 'intellectually', 'matched', 'bystander.After', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'little', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'including', 'philandering', 'as', 'well', 'illnesses', 'authors', 'mini-series', 'seem', 'make', 'moral', 'failings', 'central', 'theme', 'work', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'certainly', 'imperfect', 'human', 'being', '-as', 'were', 'men', 'who', 'served', 'office', 'myth', 'lead', 'most', 'dangerous', 'tumultuous', 'times', 'history', 'country', 'regards', 'fellow', 'presidents', 'who', 'were', 'considered', 'loyal', 'family', 'men', '-the', 'marital', 'fidelity', 'Nixon', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'were', 'never', 'questioned', 'were', 'disasters', 'Presidents', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'two', 'worst', 'crooks', 'history', 'office', 'cases', 'facts', 'would', 'fill', 'encyclopedia.In', 'regards', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'release', 'files', 'US', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Cuba', 'last', 'forty-nine', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'Kennedy', 'tapes', '-we', 'know', 'more', 'now', 'how', 'dangerous', 'era', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'Kennedy', 'leadership', 'entire', 'thirteen', 'days', 'writers', 'mini-series', 'make', 'clear', 'crisis', 'was', 'Kennedy', 'fault', 'own', 'so', 'called', 'weak', 'kneed', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'fiasco', 'once', 'Cuban', 'Missle', 'Crisis', 'was', 'underway', '-Kennedy', 'be', 'freightened', 'bystander', 'overwhelmed', 'events.Over', 'last', '25', '30', 'years', 'conservatives', 'particularly', 'neo', 'conservatives', 'have', 'been', 'busy', 'work', 'attempting', 'rewrite', 'history', 'suit', 'own', 'world', 'view', '-everything', 'blaming', 'FDR', 'Depression', 'blaming', 'JFK', 'events', 'administration', 're-writing', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'involvement', 'Iraqi', 'war', 'economic', 'meltdown', '2008', 'facts', 'are', 'stubborn', 'things', '-and', 'artistic', 'license', 'only', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'diversion', 'truth.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'docu-drama', 'more']",The Kennedys

Many of the high points of JFK's Presidency are covered and every scandal or dark secret connected to the family seems to be covered (i.e. JFK's sleeping around, Marilyn Monroe's suicide being because of JFK, Frank Sinatra and the mob, etc). Kennedy fans may consider those focuses a ""character assassination"" attempt on the man so be warned. Katie Holmes gets criticized for her role in playing Jackie Kennedy but I felt she did a commendable enough job. Barry Pepper did a lot better than I expected as Robert Kennedy and Diana Hardcastle was a startlingly good Rose Kennedy. In fact, I'd say some of the most interesting scenes were the flashbacks between her and Joe especially when their eldest child was put away into a nunnery and later lobotomized. I would have liked something about Ted Kennedy and some argue the assassination was toned down in the last episode which I partly agree with. Historian David Talbot was used as source material in the making of this miniseries. I would surmise they sometimes get it right but it's a truly rare piece that tries to be historically authentic over emotionally engaging.

I thought that it was going to be another Kennedy Approved series(as the 1983 Martin Sheen version was)but When I heard that The Kennedy family opposed it-My interest grew. However When I heard who was producing the show-Joel Surnow and Jon Cassar(who also directed)of ""24"" fame-I decided that I would get the DVDS. Boy was I ever pleasently surprised.To begin with-The Kennedys had good reason to object this. It did not present the rosey camelot view of things-Insread they showed the human side-the realistic side. They show that JFK was not the darling saint as we were led to believe-instead we see that his personal life is a shambles. Then we see Joe Sr. As he really was. He raised his boys to be ruthless-he taught them the ends justify the means.To be fair however, JFK still had to do his Job. He had to lead the country through some difficult times-Like the Cuban Missile crisis and the Civil rights movement. I was born in 1964-so I wasn't born yet-yet in watching this I get the feeling I was there-one of millions of people watching these events unfold on TV.I Believe that the history Channel reasons for not airing this is Pure bunk. The real reason why didn't air it is because the Kennedy Family put pressure on them not to air it. It is clear within the first 10 minutes of Episode 1 why the Kennedy family opposed this. They  opposed it because it was not the Camelot version-it showed us the real side.The Cast was perfect-Greg Kinnear was perfect as JFK, Katie Holmes as Jackie-and Barry Pepper as Bobby. These 3 do an amazing Job and Kudos to the makeup department-my-if this wasn't a tv show-you'd think that these were the real Kennedys-they were that good. It doesn't stop there-Tom Wilkison as Joe Sr, showed who he really was. The actress who played Rose(I forget her name)also did a good job.If I was to pick a favorite episode,It would be episode 6, the one on the Cuban Missile crisis.

While the series does have moments such as showing both JFK & Jackie taking ""vitamin"" shots to give them energy to make through their grueling schedule, showing some of JFK's philandering, it isn't a salacious tell-all exposing the dark side of the Kennedy presidency.  The heart of the series shows of the rise of JFK from young playboy to esteemed leader and the large role his father and brother Bobby played in his triumphs.  Greg Kinnear is very good as JFK.  He plays him a sympathetic figure whose main goal is to please his father.  Tom Wilkerson is excellent as the Kennedy patriarch Joe.  He plays him with a ferocity and an underlying evil streak.  Barry Pepper stands out above all as RFK.  He plays him as a man who is torn between the ambitions of his father for his sons and his want to live a quiet life with his large family.  Katie Holmes is not terrible as Jackie but she plays her as a sad and empty person which is what I guess the direction was.  She is clearly a notch below the rest of the leads, but she is game.",4,Behind The Kennedy Wall,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,1210,"['Kennedys', 'mini-series', 'started', 'air', 'controversy', 'when', 'History', 'Channel', 'decided', 'not', 'air', 'show', 'was', 'eventually', 'aired', 'Reelz', 'channel', 'series', 'have', 'moments', 'such', 'showing', 'JFK', 'Jackie', 'taking', 'vitamin', 'shots', 'give', 'energy', 'make', 'grueling', 'schedule', 'showing', 'JFK', 'philandering', ""n't"", 'salacious', 'tell-all', 'exposing', 'dark', 'side', 'Kennedy', 'presidency', 'heart', 'series', 'shows', 'rise', 'JFK', 'young', 'playboy', 'esteemed', 'leader', 'large', 'role', 'father', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'played', 'triumphs', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'very', 'good', 'JFK', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'main', 'goal', 'please', 'father', 'Tom', 'Wilkerson', 'excellent', 'Kennedy', 'patriarch', 'Joe', 'ferocity', 'underlying', 'evil', 'streak', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'out', 'above', 'all', 'RFK', 'man', 'who', 'torn', 'ambitions', 'father', 'sons', 'want', 'live', 'quiet', 'life', 'large', 'family', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'not', 'terrible', 'Jackie', 'sad', 'empty', 'person', 'what', 'guess', 'direction', 'was', 'clearly', 'notch', 'rest', 'leads', 'game']",The Kennedys
1433213,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B004YDSNMQ,Richard Masloski,"[3, 4]","Well, I'm not actually Spartacus and Greg Kinnear isn't JFK.  But in his portrayal of Kennedy, Greg Kinnear does an absolutely outstanding job!  He has the speech patterns and mannerisms of JFK down pat - and with the big wig he looks uncannily like Kennedy.  There are many scenes wherein one almost thinks they are watching newly uncovered film of the actual President.  In the scenes of him playing football with his shades on, I almost thought the producers of this series had snuck in some actual footage of the real deal.  I have no idea how Mr. Kinnear landed the role.  Unfortunately, in the interesting extra on the making of the series we are not told how Mr. K was picked to play President K - but only a casting genius could envision the actor as Kennedy.  Without the wig, without the makeup I would never in a million years pick Mr. Kinnear for the part.  But thankfully someone did - and I will say it again - Greg Kinnear is not just a Vaughn Meader (remember him?) but as others have noted, he seems to be channeling the actual man he is portraying.  Likewise with Barry Pepper's Emmy-winning portrayal of RFK.  Mr. Pepper's is a powerful, poignant performance and the award is completely earned by his actor's showcase of a performance.  And the incredibly prolific and versatile Tom Wilkinson is simply amazing as Joe Kennedy. (When Mr. Wilkinson as the Ambassador tells the actor playing Frank Sinatra to ""Shut up!"", well, it certainly doesn't seem like acting at all - and that is the highest goal to which an actor aspires, to completely hide the acting, which Mr. Wilkinson always does in whatever role he remarkably plays.  Katie Holmes as Jackie is likewise perfectly cast. Heck, the whole cast is perfectly cast!The three discs contain the full eight episodes of this controversial series.  Eight episodes - eight hours.  Eights hours is one third of a single day.  Yet the series covers decades!  Is it any wonder that THE KENNEDYS therefore seems very rushed at times?  That it doesn't include everything of import?  How could it? Yes, instead of eight episodes there should have been at least ten.  Much is missing: for some unknown reason there is no Ted Kennedy even mentioned or even hinted at; there is nothing of the space race; there are barely a few minutes devoted to Vietnam; MLK is absent; though apparently filmed but ending up on the cutting  room floor is Marilyn Monroe's singing of ""Happy Birthday"" to her secret lover.  One could go on and on - but why do so?  The series is historical drama based on actual people and events.  It is not a documentary as many others have noted.  It is presenting the saga of perhaps the most captivating family in all of American history - and attempting to illumine not only the public side of this saga, but its personal aspects as well.  It is a drama - and the undocumented moments are historical assumptions based on known facts.  If this series makes viewers want to know more about the Kennedy clan - and by way of that, huge and profound portions of American and world history - then it has succeeded in being not merely entertainment that is over as soon as the discs stop spinning, but a recreation and evocation of a time and place that is important to never lose knowledge of.  What we have here in THE KENNEDYS is, yes, an extremely entertaining, highly educational, wonderfully emotional experience.  Are there sleazy moments shown?  Sure - but much of the actual story was sleazy, just as much of Life itself is sleazy.  Does the music score overbearingly insinuate its way into each and every scene , thereby sneakily and subliminally telling us what we should be feeling and when?  Certainly - but music underscores much of our own lives, whether it be in elevators or doctors office or coming off the TV or through the walls from the kid's room.  Bottomline - the series is flawed, but nobly so.  The makers of THE KENNEDYS aimed high - and mostly achieved their aims.SPOILER ALERT: Having said all of the above, offering my applause by way of words, I was somewhat dismayed to see that in the seventh episode the film-makers present Lee Harvey Oswald's culpability in Kennedy's murder as a fait accompli.  Dramatically I can see why the film-makers bought into LHO's guilt: the cross cuts between his lonesome preparations to kill the President and Kennedy's people-mobbed approach to Dealy Plaza are rather effective.  The problem is that - if one were truly objective about the truth - there is as strong a case that Oswald didn't kill Kennedy as there is that he did.  With that in mind, a more ambiguous approach to the assassination should have been adopted in this series.  I recollect that the assassination was approached in just such a way in the Martin Sheen TV movie of years back.  In earlier episodes we clearly see President Kennedy ruffling the feathers of the FBI, the Mafia, the military-industrial complex, the rascist elements in the South, the Cubans (those both pro and anti-Castro) - so one would expect the assassination to have been left as the Mystery which it truly is.  But no - Oswald is depicted as the sole killer - even though in subsequent scenes we are shown RFK's wondering if, afterall, the Mafia or Operation Mongoose itself may have led to his brother's murder. We are even shown Pepper as RFK angered by the blatant, obvious, ridiculously intelligence-insulting  silencing of Oswald by Jack Ruby.  While these are RFK's feelings - since he was not in the Deposity building eating chicken with Oswald - they should have been ours, the viewers, as well. (BTW, if Oswald truly ate chicken with his rifle as company, where did he discard the chicken bones?  Surely his saliva and tooth marks and finger-prints could have been matched had chicken bones been discovered.) Anyway, dramatically the cross-cutting between Oswald and JFK and a stroke-ridden, wheel-chair bound, trying-to-stand Joe Kennedy and a soda bottle opening RFK somewhat works.  But leaving the actual killer or killers in question would have been, I think, even more powerful - and also more openly honest.  One last thing about this flawed yet vital episode:  we are sadly not in the limo with Kinnear's Kennedy because the actor is relegated to the sidelines for too long a time while actual footage of the motorcade is used.  When Kinnear is utilized again, as he turns to Jackie a final time before the first bullet, it comes as something as a shock, an intrusion to us viewers.  Frankly, it doesn't work.  And likewise, there is no real sense of the impact of the fatal head shot on both its target and Jackie as played by Katie Holmes.  Her scene in the hospital, alone with her dead husband, is extremely unmoving.  And this is not Ms. Holmes' fault at all; it is a script lapse and directorial dereliction.Despite my personal feelings about what's wrong with episode seven as noted above, this is still a rich, rewarding, consummately acted peek into the public and personal lives of that incredible and forever interesting clan - THE KENNEDYS.  Don't miss it!Addendum:  Two memorable moments in the series that by themselves make viewing it eminently entertaining and worthwhile - one is Joe Kennedy's telling Frank Sinatra to ""Shut up!"" and the other is JFK's leaving a White House concert - not to be shown photos of the Cuban missle sites, as we are led to believe - but to go and watch the Kirk Douglas movie SPARTACUS in his private screening room somewhere in the Freudian depths of the White House whilst chomping on a big phallic cigar and awaiting the arrival of one of his many lady-friends.  Great moments that one would never see in a documentary!  Soap opera?  Heck, yes!  But much of life is soap opera.  And unlike DALLAS or DYNASTY...this one is grounded in history!",4,I'm Spartacus!!!!!!!,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,7792,"['Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'actually', 'Spartacus', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', ""n't"",

1433216,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B004YDSNMQ,Roger J. Buffington,"[9, 13]","""The Kennedys"" ranks with the very best miniseries.  It provides a balanced look at the political lives of the Kennedy family, without becoming either a whitewash or a hatchet job.  Jack and Robert Kennedy, and Joe Kennedy, are vividly portrayed as talented and powerful, and yet flawed men.  It is an unforgivable scandal that after The History Channel commissioned this series the Kennedy establishment successfully lobbied it not to air it.  No matter, it is available in other venues including this Amazon DVD and it is not to be missed.It is obvious that what prompted the Kennedy family enmity towards this series is its frank look at the infidelities of both Jack and Joe Senior.  This is already well established and no longer the secret it was during the Kennedy presidency.  In any case it is one of numerous central themes to what appears to be, in the main, a balanced look at the Kennedy dynasty.This series takes several interesting positions on issues.  Firstly, it claims that even Joe Kennedy Sr. did not know about the Chicago ballot-box stuffing.  I found this hard to believe; the series blames it on Frank Sinatra and the local mafia crime family who it indicates did this without direct knowledge by Joe, but with the expectation that the Kennedys would be appropriately grateful (which they were not).  There are other positions that it takes as well, which I will eschew mentioning for fear of this review becoming a spoiler.The series' portrayal of Kennedy during both the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis rings true.  This is probably one of the more balanced presentations of both crises, and it is arguably the case that Kennedy learned from his mistake in the first to successfully handle the second.Anyone who is interested in politics or the Kennedys (and who isn't?) will want to own this superb miniseries.  I find myself watching it over and over again.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",5,"Five stars -- true to life, unvarnished history.

1433218,A2UYGOYMV73826,B004YDSNMQ,Rushmore,"[1, 1]","I spent the past weekend watching this 8-hour opus (about 6 hours on DVD plus a making-of feature) and was pleasantly surprised.  The impression I got from the controversy surrounding the broadcast was much ado about an ultimately unworthy production.  This is actually a pretty respectful, mostly well-acted accounting of what most people already know about the Kennedys.Let me start right off by saying Katie Holmes did a good job.  That seems to be what most people want to talk about first.  I always felt Jackie was guarded and did not show much expression, and that's exactly what Katie captured.  She does have a rather remarkable resemblance to Jackie.The second thing that most reviewers want to focus on is the portrait of the patriarch Joe Kennedy.  Since he was not so prominent in the media, the producers could take a little more liberty with his character.  I absolutely believe that Joe could have been every bit as Machiavellian and austere as portrayed by the awesome Tom Wilkinson.  How ironic that he outlived his three dynamic, handsome and compelling sons.And while we are on the subject of sons, where was Teddy?  That's what bugs me most about this production.  Like other reviewers, I assumed since so much time was taken up with JFK's presidency, they would not even deal with Bobby's candidacy and assassination.  Since they did, however briefly, I would have thought a few seconds could have been devoted to Teddy.  The decision to omit him baffles me.  I suppose Teddy was still alive while this series was being filmed, but I am pretty sure it was released after his death.  In the making-of feature, someone mentions that one of their first decisions was which Kennedys they were going to focus on, but no specific mention of Teddy whose absence is glaring to me.Greg Kinnear and Barry Pepper are both quite good as JFK and RFK, but the acting prize goes to Kristin Booth as Ethel.  She really lights up the screen in every scene.  The only outrageously bad performance was the actor who played the young JFK.  His Boston accent consisted solely of changing his ""ars"" into ""ahs"".  That's really not all it takes.

Come on, do you really expect the world to believe that the Kennedy brothers were killed by lone, single oddballs?The overly simplistic and official version of the tragic Kennedy deaths do not do justice to the truth.Were the brothers murdered because their political rivals, the CIA and the American military-industrial complex wanted to continue to wage phoney wars, like those in Asia - wars that killed MILLIONS OF innocent civilians that are unreported and ignored even to this day? Could the wars in Indo-china be avoided or scaled down if JFK had remained in office?Or, were the brothers killed because they were initiating reforms to civil rights for minority groups? Martin Luther King, Jr. was killed in 1968 and he had also met with tremendous political obstacles that wanted to impede societal reform.Or, were the Kennedy brothers killed BECAUSE they were Catholics? They were living in times when anti-Catholicism was still rife in America, within an insane fearful environment created and propagated by fanatics from the Protestant camp. America was, and is, after all, a Protestant/atheist country with crazy right-ring elements that can't seem to think rationally.Out with the truth, History Channel!On a lighter note, actress Charlotte Sullivan is a hottie that could have spiced up this show! She takes up about 10-15 mins of air-time as Marilyn Monroe, whom JFK had had a fling with. Charlotte Sullivan looks more sizzling than Marilyn Monroe! If you want to watch more of Charlotte, be sure to catch the TV series ""Rookie Blue""!What's great about this mini-series is how the actors look almost like the historical characters that they play.Recommended Reading:Plausible Denial: Was the CIA Involved in the Assassination of JFK?Watch actress Charlotte Sullivan in ""Rookie Blue"":Rookie Blue: The Complete First Season",4,Who REALLY killed the Kennedy brothers?,1316736000,"09 23, 2011",2011,1987,"['Having', 'watched', 'mini-series', 'History', 'Channel', 'Asia', 'only', 'questions', 'linger', 'are', 'ones', 'surround', 'murders', 'Kennedy', 'brothers', 'Come', 'do', 'really', 'expect', 'world', 'believe', 'Kennedy', 'brothers', 'were', 'killed', 'lone', 'single', 'oddballs', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'official', 'version', 'tragic', 'Kennedy', 'deaths', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'brothers', 'murdered', 'political', 'rivals', 'CIA', 'American', 'military-industrial', 'complex', 'wanted', 'continue', 'wage', 'phoney', 'wars', 'Asia', 'wars', 'killed', 'MILLIONS', 'OF', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'are', 'unreported', 'ignored', 'even', 'day', 'Could', 'wars', 'Indo-china', 'be', 'avoided', 'scaled', 'down', 'JFK', 'had', 'remained', 'office', 'were', 'brothers', 'killed', 'were', 'initiating', 'reforms', 'civil', 'rights', 'minority', 'groups', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'was', 'killed', '1968', 'had', 'also', 'met', 'tremendous', 'political', 'obstacles', 'wanted', 'impede', 'societal', 'reform.Or', 'were', 'Kennedy', 'brothers', 'killed', 'were', 'Catholics', 'were', 'living', 'times', 'when', 'anti-Catholicism', 'was', 'still', 'rife', 'America', 'insane', 'fearful', 'environment', 'created', 'propagated', 'fanatics', 'Protestant', 'camp', 'America', 'was', 'Protestant/atheist', 'country', 'crazy', 'right-ring', 'elements', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'think', 'rationally.Out', 'truth', 'History', 'Channel', 'lighter', 'note', 'actress', 'Charlotte', 'Sullivan', 'hottie', 'could', 'have', 'spiced', 'up', 'show', 'up', '10-15', 'mins', 'air-time', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'whom', 'JFK', 'had', 'had', 'fling', 'Charlotte', 'Sullivan', 'more', 'sizzling', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'Charlotte', 'be', 'sure', 'catch', 'TV', 'series', 'Rookie', 'Blue', 'What', 'great', 'mini-series', 'how', 'actors', 'look', 'almost', 'historical', 'characters', 'play.Recommended', 'Reading', 'Plausible', 'Denial', 'Was', 'CIA', 'Involved', 'Assassination', 'JFK', 'Watch', 'actress', 'Charlotte', 'Sullivan', 'Rookie', 'Blue', 'Rookie', 'Blue', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season']",The Kennedys

The controversialmini-series passed on by the History Channel that shows the highlightsof the life of JFK (Kinnear) and RFK (Pepper). Beginning with thefamily preparing for election night and following them, withflashbacks, until the assassination of Bobby. Being a huge historybuff, and more specifically a Kennedy buff I was very much interestedin this. When I saw Greg Kinnear and Barry Pepper playing the roles ofJack and Bobby I was excited to see them in this. I was notdisappointed at all. While some of the events were not exactly as theyhappened (Joe finding out about the assassination for one) this isstill a very good account of the life of the men. Being a mini seriesand so much to cover almost all of the events are glossed over quickly,(the Cuban Missle Crisis is begun and finished in 42 minutes) but theimportant aspects are in this. The acting is fantastic from everyone,and the casting is perfect, much like Jaoquin Phoenix in ""Walk TheLine"" no make up (besides the hair) was used and you swear that Kinnearis actually JFK. I can see why the History Channel did pass on thisseries though in the fact that it's not 100% accurate, but this is verymuch worth watching. This can easily stand up to (and in my opinionsurpasses) the ""John Adams"" series. Overall, a fantastic award worthyseries. Both for the series and the acting.
