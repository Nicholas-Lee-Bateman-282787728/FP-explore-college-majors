A lot of people dismiss films of this genre but when it is as witty and well acted as this one you just gotta love it! Holden and Hepburn reteam here; their first movie was Sabrinia and this time he gets the girl. The plot is simple, writer is blocked and hires a typist played by Hepburn who with her smile and elegance quickly becomes Holden's muse. The movie takes you all over Paris in beautiful colorful images and breathtaking cinematogrophy. Holden has always been a screen presence in it's highest power his rugged looks and stattaco voice makes him the ultimate movie star and Hepburn is their to match him in every way as his female equal!

So with only two days to get the script finished, the couple set about coming up with a plot, adding romance, twists, humour, switches, switches on switches, and switches on switches on switches!The script is then brought to life by the imagination of Holden and Hepburn. With Holden playing the main man, and Hepburn playing the main girl.

218765,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300215776,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","As a whole I found `Paris When it Sizzles' to be far more entertaining than the reviews would have you believe. It was fun and exciting and even breathtaking in scenes, and it never lost your interest for something was constantly going on, but when all was said and done I felt as if the film was truly a missed opportunity. Instead of giving us that `switch' in the end the film merely falls into the clich&eacute;d Hollywood ending that the two main characters were fighting so fervently against throughout the entirety of the film.`Paris When it Sizzles' is a film about a screenwriter who is having trouble finishing his latest film; `The Girl who Stole the Eiffel Tower'. He hires a typist to help him capture his sporadic ideas and thus begins the journey through screenwriting that is `Paris When it Sizzles'. Having a mere day to finish the film, both Richard and Gabrielle spout ideas off one another, acting them out in countless fantasy sequences. `The Girl who Stole the Eiffel Tower' shifts from love story to gangster film to horror film, each sequence just as entertaining as the last and each scene containing the `switch on a switch on a switch' to make it interesting and absorbing.But that's also where the films falls apart; in the `switch on a switch' department. Throughout the film Richard is informing Gabrielle on the importance of always including a switch, to keep the audience guessing, but director Richard Quine, and more importantly writers Duvivier and Jeanson, didn't realize the importance of including a switch in their own film. Instead the film ends like almost every other romantic comedy out there.Many have noted that Holden and Hepburn didn't seem to have the greatest of chemistry in the film, which is a plus and a minus. It aids in their fictional character development (as in when they are in their fantasy world) but it struggles to establish any real connection when they are simply playing Richard and Gabrielle. Thus, in the end, their inevitable romance is slightly unbelievable.I will admit that `Paris When it Sizzles' is not a trainwreck, but it isn't anything special or new either. It had major potential, and the whole fantasy aspect of the film is enthralling, but the film sadly dwindles down to a predictable conclusion. If they had included that much desired `switch' in the end it would have garnered an `A' from me, but its lack there of leaves it with a low `B'. Hepburn is always delightful (and thank god she isn't singing in this one), and Holden is a desirable leading man, even when he doesn't seem too interested in you, so their presence doesn't hurt the film at all. This film is unfairly attacked for the wrong reasons. It's pure entertainment, and for that it should be lauded. It's just not as original as it tries to be; and for that it should be reprimanded.",4,Fails to heed its own advice...,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,2834,"['whole', 'found', 'Paris', 'When', 'Sizzles', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'reviews', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'was', 'fun', 'exciting', 'even', 'breathtaking', 'scenes', 'never', 'lost', 'interest', 'something', 'was', 'constantly', 'going', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'truly', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Instead', 'giving', 'switch', 'end', 'film', 'merely', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'fighting', 'so', 'fervently', 'entirety', 'film.', 'Paris', 'When', 'Sizzles', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'having', 'trouble', 'finishing', 'latest', 'film', 'Girl', 'who', 'Stole', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'typist', 'help', 'capture', 'sporadic', 'ideas', 'thus', 'journey', 'screenwriting', 'Paris', 'When', 'Sizzles', 'Having', 'mere', 'day', 'finish', 'film', 'Richard', 'Gabrielle', 'spout', 'ideas', 'off', 'one', 'acting', 'out', 'countless', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'Girl', 'who', 'Stole', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'shifts', 'love', 'story', 'gangster', 'film', 'horror', 'film', 'sequence', 'just', 'as', 'entertaining', 'last', 'scene', 'containing', 'switch', 'switch', 'switch', 'make', 'interesting', 'also', 'where', 'films', 'apart', 'switch', 'switch', 'department', 'film', 'Richard', 'informing', 'Gabrielle', 'importance', 'always', 'including', 'switch', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'director', 'Richard', 'Quine', 'more', 'importantly', 'writers', 'Duvivier', 'Jeanson', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'importance', 'including', 'switch', 'own', 'film', 'Instead', 'film', 'almost', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'there.Many', 'have', 'noted', 'Holden', 'Hepburn', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'greatest', 'chemistry', 'film', 'plus', 'minus', 'fictional', 'character', 'development', 'when', 'are', 'fantasy', 'world', 'establish', 'real', 'connection', 'when', 'are', 'simply', 'playing', 'Richard', 'Gabrielle', 'Thus', 'end', 'inevitable', 'romance', 'slightly', 'unbelievable.I', 'will', 'admit', 'Paris', 'When', 'Sizzles', 'not', 'trainwreck', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'new', 'had', 'major', 'potential', 'whole', 'fantasy', 'aspect', 'film', 'enthralling', 'film', 'sadly', 'down', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'had', 'included', 'much', 'desired', 'switch', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'garnered', 'A', 'lack', 'leaves', 'low', 'B', 'Hepburn', 'always', 'delightful', 'thank', 'god', ""n't"", 'singing', 'one', 'Holden', 'desirable', 'leading', 'man', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'interested', 'presence', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'film', 'film', 'unfairly', 'attacked', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'should', 'be', 'lauded', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'original', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'reprimanded']",N/A

Audrey Hepburn and William Holden are great in this stream-of- conciousness story of a writer and his  typist creating an original script in just one weekend, about a plot that  takes place, in Paris, all in one day-Bastille Day (July 14). Although some  viewers, who are not willing to watch with an open mind, may find it hard  to follow, those who watch with the proper perspective will thoroughly  enjoy this spoof on the difficulties involved in the creative process.  Watching Audrey Hepburn's and William Holden's characters distill their  sudden ideas and sudden blocks into a cohesive and logical storyline are a  joy to follow along with. Even though it can be a start-stop-start-stop  train of thought, that's the real fun of this movie: watching the  &quot;story- within-the-story&quot; evolve. You don't what to expect next,  what parts of what you just watched will be deleted, will they move  backward or forward? THAT'S the challenge and the FUN of this great,  visionary (and for its time,experimental)  film!  Of course, the wonderful  scenery, fashions, and production values are in keeping with what viewers  would expect from an Audrey Hepburn comedy. Watch for Tony Curtis in a  hilarious cameo role as Audrey Hepburn's beatnik boyfriend. Audrey's  Gabrielle is equally hilarious trying to communicate with him in  beatnik-speak, and winds up sounding like France's first (Loire)Valley  Girl...&quot;Oh, Maurice, I'm, LIKE, so happy for you...&quot; Also watch  for cameos by Marlene Dietrich, and others, including a voice-over cameo by  Frank Sinatra, as imagined singing the would-be title song of the film  being created, &quot;The Girl Who Stole The Eiffel Tower.&quot; Break out  the baguettes, the escargot, and the Perrier: the scene in which the  writers order room service will have you salivating on the spot.

There is in fact a bit of Paris about the young actress, who makes of even comic farce an attractive evening's viewing.Her characters - this film's secretary Miss Gabrielle Simpson - veer between naivet&eacute; and shrewdness, never quite declaring allegiance to either of the available extremes.

218787,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300215776,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Even though this 1964 comedy is not a complete misfire, this is not remotely my favorite movie of either Audrey Hepburn or William Holden. A decade after their initial coupling in Billy Wilder's class-conscious romantic souffl&eacute;, ""Sabrina"", the two stars are re-teamed under the far more heavy-handed direction of Richard Quine in an overly contrived, intermittently funny screenplay by George Axelrod. The result feels like the old-style French farce upon which it is based but with the artificial veneer of 1960's Hollywood studio product (even though it was filmed primarily on Paris sound stages). That's a shame since Hepburn and Holden can be game farceurs when properly motivated, but here they are unfortunately made to play more broadly than usual with an over-reliance on their screen personas.The frothy plot centers on aging Hollywood screenwriter Richard Benson, who is holed up in Paris attempting to beat the deadline set forth by big-time producer Alexander Meyerheim to finish his latest screenplay. Benson has to hand in the completed script in two days, but the problem is that he hasn't even started since he has been busy boozing and womanizing in typical alpha-male fashion. He hires impressionable Gabrielle Simpson as his live-in secretary and becomes inspired to write the aptly named ""The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower"" (complete with an opening theme from Frank Sinatra). The rest of the movie goes back and forth between the reality of the impending deadline at Richard's apartment and the fantasy scenes of the screenplay coming to life.There is no suspense as to how it will end, but it does have its charms with some silly spy-caper turns and cameo appearances by Marlene Dietrich in a walk-on, Noel Coward as Meyerheim, and a particularly amusing Tony Curtis as Gabrielle's Method-style actor boyfriend. At 110 minutes, the movie feels overlong, and the film is visually hamstrung by phony backdrops and studio sets typical of the period. Right between ""Charade"" and ""My Fair Lady"", Hepburn is never less than charming here, while Holden keeps his innate hamminess in check. However, neither seems especially challenged by the comic proceedings.

And unfortunately, it is some of her worst acting work, posey, sing-song, and superficial.  Now, if you've read her bio, and know what was going on with her and Holden, that could explain it, but still, this film is very static.Like most Heburn films, a highlight is her clothes, her style, her self.  This film self-consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better.  There are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here.  This film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead.  Jayne Mansfield could have been a hoot in this, Thelma Ritter too, in a very different way, somebody with less style and more off beat snap, crackle, and pop.  (Thelma Ritter and William Holden paired in a romantic comedy... I'm all ready laughing!)Before I hit this too harshly, this film was intended to be a trifle, the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles.

This film is a feeble, incoherent mess that exploits as a plot device the fact that it has no script. Holden portrays a jaded screenwriter [done with much greater effect in Sunset Boulevard] who can't seem to get his pages turned in to his producer. Inexplicably, he hires a typist and now you have two characters sitting there wondering what happens next along with the audience. It's possible that there was no working with William Holden, who was a pretty serious drunk by this time and that the short ""scenes"" made it possible to get product out of him at all. Furthermore, Ms. Hepburn's previous torrid romance with Mr. Holden (begun on the set of 'Sabrina') had abruptly ended when a man who could commit to her did so with a ring and she dropped Holden (who was officially, but not sincerely married) like a bad habit. By the time this deal from Paramount rolled around, it was a decade since they'd parted. He tried fruitlessly to win her back. The constant proximity to her in this film must have been very unhelpful in managing his compulsion to drink. There is one ingredient in the film that actually adds life to it: a bit part by Tony Curtis. In my opinion, he was added as an after-thought to save the picture. If you want to see pretty much the same performance of wide-eyed surprise, and spirited running around from Ms. Hepburn, watch the picture she made next, another overly-long, but well-scripted switch-on-switch dramedy called 'Charade', with Cary Grant.

That includes, My Fair Lady, Sabrina, Roman Holiday, Charade, and Wait Until Dark...so I liked it.  It includes some movie techniques that definitely seem innovative at the time it came out in 1964.  The film within a film convention keeps you engaged as Holden and Hepburn's characters write and rewrite the script to &quot;The Girl who stole the Eifel Tower.&quot;  The story cuts to the characters they create that begin to closely resemble themselves.  It gives some light insight to how scripts might become movies.  The interplay between the two character foils played by Hepburn and Holden is what is so engaging about this romantic comedy.  Holden's cynical witty world-weary outlook matched with Hepburn vibrant wide-eyed ready to engage life outlook is truly engaging.  You find yourself watching Hepburn's grace mixed with comedic suave to just see what she will do next.  She truly is the best thing that has came along for the silverscreen and has some classic lines/phrases to boot,  &quot;I just go ape.&quot;,  &quot;we got along swimmingly.&quot;  Another witty convention in this movie is that there are thinly veiled references to Hepburn's other movies along the way...this keeps the Hepburn-phile laughing.  There's a mention of a cut to the lonely cat in the rain ala Breakfast and a debate whether My Fair Lady is the Frankenstein story retold. Thoroughly engaging.  The show has some fairly risque for the time shots of girls in bikinis, which is a bonus for the male viewers out there.  If there is one setback for this movie, it is that it tries to be a &quot;big Hollywood production&quot; in places, where it need not be...your know car chases, plenty of people running around, gunshots, etc.  It should just stick to its guns as a witty funny slightly artistic study on screenwriting and an unlikely developing relationship.

Eventually, we have to ask ourselves if they finished their task or was ""Paris When it Sizzles"" their final script (with the ""joke"" being on us).  Along the way, I found myself caring not so much HOW it was going to end so long as it DID end.  Holden has that great glib voice of his but there wasn't much of note coming from it.  In the interst of trying to find something positive to say, I'll spare my opinions of Audrey Hepburn.  On the positive note, this was one of the best performances I've seen by Tony Curtis.

I saw this in 1964 when it was first released, and thought to myself that George Axelrod was having writer's block, so he wrote a movie about it. Richard Quine directed most of the bubbly comedies in the 60's (which are now justifiably forgotten), and this is almost one of them. There are many things, however, that make this film compelling to a film aficianado (as I like to think of myself). The acting is unforgivably hammy, but the hamminess is energetic. Let's not forget that Hepburn (Roman Holiday) and Holden (Stalag 13), both won the top acting Oscars in 1953, and they were paired the following year by the great Billy Wilder in ""Sabrina"".  There, they had absolute chemistry; 10 years later...where'd it go? There are an awful lot of very clever one-liners. I liked most of them. Especially clever was when she was chased around the table by the vampire, and terrific product placement has a bottle of Heinz Steak Sauce visible. There are clever cameos from Noel Coward, Marlene Dietrich, Tony Curtis and Frank Sinatra (vocal).  Unfortunately, clever one-liners do not make a plot. There really isn't one. Still, it's some great actors having more fun than the viewer. Hepburn is quite radiant; Holden still has charm (mixed with smarm). There's also Fred Astaire singing ""That Face"", which I think is original for this film. Not a bad song. Referring to Audrey, the song is appropriate. She never looked so beautiful, even in ""My Fair Lady"", released the same year. I guess it's a pretty lousy film overall, though production values are high. The DVD has a nice 1.85:1 LBX, though Paramount had VistaVision, which was wider (20th Century Fox had Cinemascope, United Artists had Panavision, etc). The price is right, but if you want to really watch great actors chew up scenery, hammy 'n all, wait for the DVD release of ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"". It might happen...It's a GREAT display of film-making and production values.

A quirky pixy like woman who seems to be over dressed (I don't know about the time the movie was released as I was not alive then) for the parts she plays. I guess this was all about the ""its good to be different"" push that was on during that era. I bet if her films were made today she would have a bunch of crystals sitting around her living room and practice Buddhism or Cabala or something. Anyway . . . hte movie . . . it was about a writer (Holden) who can't get the book finished . . . so he hires an assistant (Hepburn) and they actually show the two as characters in teh book running around Paris acting out the parts of the book as the writer writes it. Then they back it up and replay it they way he rewrites it. It might have been a unique gimmick back then but I have seen it before and it really doesn't make the movie then or now when it is used. If anything see it to see if you can catch some of the supposed chemistry between the two actors. They supposedly had a fling at one time before the movie. She dumped him.

It was NOT filmed in Paris, except for a few fleeting scenes using body doubles for Holden and Hepburn getting in and out of cars and implausible situations intended to be comedic.  The whole thing is hollow, preposterous and totally predictable and had it actually been filmed in Paris instead of one Hollywood set after another, it might have been worth some praise . . . but as is, it really deserves to be titled ""Paris When It Fizzles.""",2,It Ain't Paris and There Ain't No Sizzle,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,692,"['did', 'appreciate', 'seeing', 'William', 'Holden', 'humorous', 'role', 'change', 'screenplay-within-a-screenplay', 'ploy', 'soon', 'flat', 'weight', 'own', 'vapid', 'storyline', 'even', 'adequate', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'dismal', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'was', 'NOT', 'filmed', 'Paris', 'few', 'fleeting', 'scenes', 'using', 'body', 'doubles', 'Holden', 'Hepburn', 'getting', 'cars', 'implausible', 'situations', 'intended', 'be', 'comedic', 'whole', 'thing', 'hollow', 'preposterous', 'totally', 'predictable', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'filmed', 'Paris', 'instead', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'set', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'praise', 'really', 'be', 'titled', 'Paris', 'When', 'Fizzles']",N/A
218831,A1X6M6IINHDSRC,6300215776,Thor,"[3, 3]","Paris When It Sizzles follows a writer played by William Holden who has to get a script finished within two days. He gets the help of the lovely Audrey Hepburn. Together they digg deeply in their minds, making up the most ridicilous but oh so fun stories, as they try to succeed in completing a story they can deliver to the waiting movieproducer...After being together on the screen in the romantic comedy Sabrina (1954), William Holden and Audrey Hepburn team up once again to bring a nice sixties comedy with Paris when it Sizzles. The chemistry between the two is nice and together they take you through the exciting world of movie writting. It is real fun to see how they come up with the most ridicilous stories. From Dracula to spies in trenchcoats, from planes to indians, it's all in their wonderful made up stories.Considering the acting, the film is fine. William Holden was nicely cast as the writer Richard Benson. He plays the role with great enthusiasm and is also charming. With Audrey Hepburn you just can't go wrong. Even if the movie is bad, her charm makes you respect it. Her role in this film is pure fun as she also acts enthusiastic next to Holden. You can see that she had a lot of fun portraying her character.They may react a bit unrealistic to one another sometimes, it is an absolute joy to see it. Especially as they play the main characters in their own stories with fun overreacted acting.Another fun fact is that there are cameo roles of famous fifties and sixties moviestars in the film. If you watch alot of movies out of this period, you will be delightfully surprised by the familiar faces.Also, the locations are colorful, the music is fun, which gives a great atmosphere and enjoyable 60's movie entertainment.This film is definitely a must see for want to be future Writers. There is alot to learn from this film. But if you are just in search of some nice 60's fun on a boring night, I would recommend you this film also. Be surprised by the switch on a switch on a switch, and enjoy the funny comedic sizzling stories these two come up with.",4,Paris When It Sizzles  -  Great Fun,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,2083,"['Paris', 'When', 'writer', 'played', 'William', 'Holden', 'who', 'get', 'script', 'finished', 'two', 'days', 'help', 'lovely', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Together', 'digg', 'deeply', 'minds', 'making', 'up', 'most', 'ridicilous', 'so', 'fun', 'stories', 'try', 'succeed', 'completing', 'story', 'can', 'deliver', 'waiting', 'movieproducer', 'being', 'together', 'screen', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Sabrina', '1954', 'William', 'Holden', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'team', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'bring', 'nice', 'sixties', 'comedy', 'Paris', 'when', 'Sizzles', 'chemistry', 'two', 'nice', 'together', 'take', 'exciting', 'world', 'movie', 'writting', 'real', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'come', 'up', 'most', 'ridicilous', 'stories', 'Dracula', 'spies', 'trenchcoats', 'planes', 'indians', 'wonderful', 'made', 'up', 'stories.Considering', 'acting', 'film', 'fine', 'William', 'Holden', 'was', 'nicely', 'cast', 'writer', 'Richard', 'Benson', 'role', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'also', 'charming', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Even', 'movie', 'bad', 'charm', 'respect', 'role', 'film', 'pure', 'fun', 'also', 'enthusiastic', 'next', 'Holden', 'can', 'see', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'portraying', 'character.They', 'may', 'react', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'one', 'sometimes', 'absolute', 'joy', 'see', 'Especially', 'play', 'main', 'characters', 'own', 'stories', 'fun', 'overreacted', 'acting.Another', 'fun', 'fact', 'are', 'cameo', 'roles', 'famous', 'fifties', 'sixties', 'moviestars', 'film', 'watch', 'alot', 'movies', 'period', 'will', 'be', 'delightfully', 'surprised', 'familiar', 'faces.Also', 'locations', 'are', 'colorful', 'music', 'fun', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'enjoyable', '60', 'movie', 'entertainment.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'must', 'see', 'want', 'be', 'future', 'Writers', 'alot', 'learn', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'search', 'nice', '60', 'fun', 'boring', 'night', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'also', 'Be', 'surprised', 'switch', 'switch', 'switch', 'enjoy', 'funny', 'comedic', 'sizzling', 'stories', 'two', 'come', 'up']",N/A

Both feature screenwriters desperate to pound out a feasible movie script, but the Cage film succeeds brilliantly in making the whole enterprise absurd and hilariously funny. Not so this film - Holden is too cocky and annoying to be sympathetic, and the age gap between him and Hepburn (like Cooper and Hepburn in ""Love in the Afternoon"") makes him seem more like a lecherous old man than a potential soul mate. The plot within the plot starts off as mildly amusing, then tedious with the back and forth ""flashbacks"" and then ends with a ridiculously drawn-out ending that makes no sense and leaves you feeling drained. You know a film is bad when even cameos by Marlene Dietrich, Noel Coward and some amusing bits by Tony Curtis can't save the film. What's worse, you don't get to see that much of Paris, only some cliched exterior shots and many interiors shot obviously in Hollywood. Pass!",2,"Meh.
