1427880,A2WVEBYYZXU3LQ,B004TPJN2S,Bonnie,"[2, 2]","There has never been a TV series more enthralling and captivating than MI-5. The BBC does make the most unbelievably, awe-inspiring television substance ever!  I have been watching MI-5 for years and I am just so amazed that each and every episode can draw so much thought-provoking, entertainment...global espionage at its finest. By far, the BEST production in a series!  Some of the most unique attributes to this show are: the detailed content of world current events - global terrorism, political upheaval, al-Qaeda plots, trafficking, etc.; the killing off of the main characters and replacing them with fresh faces (but I did love all the old Spooks); and ""Harry"" (Peter Firth), my favorite, is the best character actor any show has ever had (he fits the character perfectly).Season 9 Highlights include: Harry being trapped in a problematic situation when he is forced to work with the Russians; tensions amongst the CIA and MI5 over mysteries hackers; Lucas North's horrific past uncovered by Harry; Harry asks Ruth to marry him and she turns him down; and the overall deceit and hidden secrets every character seems to have is so overpowering (you just never know who to trust, what their concealing, or what will occur next). The intensity in each episode's storyline is brilliantly written.  Highly recommend MI-5!

Returning to the MI-5 universe shows a plethora of different faces, but the same slick style and high-end production values. It was easy to plug back into the series, even though I had missed big happenings. No matter. The engine picked up steam right out of the gate with a very cool al-Qaeda plot to kick the series off (miles better than the goofy ""global anti-abortion terrorist"" that started the introductory batch of episodes). From there, the stories retain effective momentum, Lucas's enigmatic past providing the background arc that pushes the series forward. The easy comparison for MI-5 is 24. Plots are tense and filmed with cinematic sensibilities, propelling episodes forward with verve. Add a driving score, tight zooms onto sweaty brows, and timely villains, and MI-5 retains what had attracted me eight series ago.

How easy is it to ""turn"" one of the best and seeminly most loyal agents? In Season 9, we quickly learn Lucas North has a secret and it's one that could bring him and MI-5 down. This mystery follows us through the 8 episodes. What is Lucas's secret? Each episode brings us closer to the shocking answer and by the last episode, it will be hard to believe what has transpired over the season. The season has Lucas dealing with this secret as he tries to continue with his duties.As usual, agents are lost and new ones come aboard. Sometimes it seems like it is awfully easy to join the MI-5 team, but I guess that is the fun of this show. The limits of believability are stretched so thin sometimes that everything seems real.Lovely Nicola Walker is stunning as agent Ruth Evershed. Walker's ability to move the audience is more than evident as she becomes a key character this season. Her role is meatier than it has ever been and she is a much more active member of the force. Walker brings dedicated and passion to the role of Evershed and has been my favorite character from early on. Her love and respect for Harry is constantly challenged yet she continues with dignity and respect.Only one more season if left of MI-5 and I can't wait to see how the show ends.

I've been a big fan of this series and until I got to the last few episodes of this season I would have given it a consistent 4 or 5 stars.  However, the plot twist involving Lucas North deserves no stars at all.  It was totally unbelievable.  They've had some other characters take unlikely turns in the past, but they've mostly been secondary characters and you could accept it because you never did know that much about them.  However, we've been living with Lucas for several seasons now and this plot twist just seemed like something the writers pulled out of their butts.  I am relieved that they waited until the end of the penultimate season before pulling this kind of half baked stunt because if they had done anything this insulting to our intelligence in an earlier season I probably would have stopped watching.

I have mourned at the loss of diffrent characters throughout the series, & I think that is what is missing for me in season 9. Those great characters who started full of enthusiasm & energy & became flawed as they couldn't seperate themselves from the job. That along with the intriguing plots are what made the show.

I've watched it from the beginning and I can honestly say season 9 is good as all the rest and only Peter Firth, who plays Director Harry Pierce has been there since the beginning. Their aren't enough accolades to describe how good of a spy show this is. They take crises events happening all over the globe, and turn them into stories where MI-5 has to get involved to avert catastrophy. The cases the agents take on are always gripping and filled with moral dilemmas. Explosions, assassinations, car chases, blackmail, not to mention the personal torture of the British agents carrying out these missions, its all here. And keep in mind if the players keep changing but the series stays so compeling it has to mean that the strength of this show lies in the writing; the writing is the best on TV in my view. ""24"" is a great show--fast and intense; but MI-5 is to spy shows what ""The Wire"" is to cop shows; rich, layered, cerebral, and rewarding if you give it your time. And about the actors? I loved Matthew McFadden, and Rupert Perry the previous 'Alpha-Male'agents, but Richard Armitage is by far the baddest and most compelling to be the team leader.

If the character did some bad things but struggled with it and didn't cross the line of killing or totally betraying friends, I could understand it. Also, the killing or leaving of 3 main characters last season blunts the impact of the story since most of the new characters hardly know Lucas. The new characters were hardly developed and too new for this type of storyline. Killing off main characters is sometimes good story telling or necessary if actors leave the show. But if the writers intent was to keep things fresh or exciting, the result is tiresome. It would have been much better to keep the old characters.Ditto for killing guest characters or some villains. After a while, you can assume that most people on the show will eventually die. Some good characters, like Arkady from season 7, could have been more utilized instead of being replaced by one sided characters. The same goes for the turnover of CIA representatives and the Home Secretary.

1427901,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B004TPJN2S,"Ray ""A Reader""","[4, 5]","MI-5 must surely be one of the best action/drama series ever made. My wife and I have watched every episode in order, starting with the first season, and, most recently, have patiently anticipated  this latest 9th season DVD release. I must confess that the price of some of the earlier season sets has been hideously painful (this particular season, however, has had a large price drop, a welcome move). However, it's been worth it all the way. I can easily say that this series is more compelling, more intelligent, more dramatic, and more thought provoking than almost any other series I've watched since childhood, and that's saying a lot.MI-5 is an action drama that focuses on ""the defense of the realm"" by the secret service in the UK. (The MI-5 branch focuses on domestic threats, whereas another UK security service, MI-6, focuses on international threats.) The series revolves around a group of individuals who enter MI-5 from all kinds of backgrounds and are drawn into the dangers and uncertain world that their organization id designed to address. And although MI-5 is a domestic agency, many of the stories center on threats from external sources that have found their way to the shores of the UK. Most every type of threat one can imagine is addressed in the episodes throughout the seasons, many loosely modelled on current world events and threats.One of the most amazing things about MI-5 is that it seems to defy the standard conventional rule that dictates that shows ""peter out"" after about five years or so. I don't need to name the shows that demonstrate this rule almost as though it were a fundamental law of the entertainment industry. The causes of such are perfectly reasonable; as Carl Reiner said when he ended The Dick Van Dyke Show when it was at the absolute top of its box office ratings (and was putting out the best episodes in the series' run), once you pass that point, it is a slow and painful contraction that is not in the audience's interest. He was right, and one can count off the numerous TV series that have gone down just this route.MI-5 is that rare beast that breaks right through that ""fundamental law"" and seems to just ignore that it ever existed. Starting with Season One, the episodes just seem to get increasingly compelling and powerful, with amazing cliffhangers, curve balls, cast rotations, new story lines, and more, all of which combine to make the show as fresh in Season Nine as it was in Season One. Really. And it's not doen through cheap tricks or increasingly outlandish settings. The show remains intelligent and realistic through it all.I do have to say that MI-5 really works best when one watches the shows in order, starting from the beginning. It's just not one of those shows where one can randomly enter at any point. It's not to say that you would not enjoy random episodes, but rather, that in order to really understand and enjoy the story lines, you must watch it from the beginning, watch the characters and the stories evolve, and you'll then feel like you are on a surfboard riding a wave. Most seasons run a single theme with supplemental variations, and are built off the prior season. Similarly, they establish the premise for the next season to come. I've often likened MI-5 to one of those plate-twirlers who gets a plate twirling at the top of a stick, then adds another on a new stick with another plate, then another, and then another, to the point that you can't believe what you are seeing: an entire series of little sticks with dinner plates all inexplicably twirling at the top of them all. That's what MI-5 is like.Season Nine contains a little bit of a thematic change from the previous two seasons (Seasons Seven and Eight), but that's what MI-5 is all about: the unexpected. It's gritty, exciting, engrossing, and intelligent. If you want to see how drama and action are best done using a superior production team, superb acting, and first class script writing, there's no better place to go. Amazing.So, yes, Season Nine is great. But if you haven't seen the earlier episode yet, go back, start with Season One, and watch the episodes in order. (The very first episode of Season One is probably the weakest in the entire series of nine years, but we can overlook this as the show initially gets its feet on the ground; it's not bad, but it's not stellar, either.) But by the time the second episode starts, you get drawn into the stories and action, and it doesn't let up all the way through this current season. Season 10 is likely in production now in the UK (mid 2011), and should be eventually be released somewhere in mid 2012. That gives you plenty of time to watch the first Nine Seasons, and, take my word for it, you'll probably want to watch the sets more than once. Each episode is more like a full production movie than a TV show.Six stars. No, seven. I've never seen any show like it.The First Eight Seasons:MI-5, Volume 1MI-5, Volume 2MI-5, Volume 3MI-5, Volume 4MI-5, Volume 5MI-5, Volume 6MI-5, Volume 7MI-5: Volume 8",5,Still Strong After Nine
