Waterston did a good job of exposing myths and making Lincoln the great man that he was, not the icon that he has become. It is the first I have seen to explore the mental illness of Mrs. Lincoln, and her relationship to her husband.NOT in the league of D. D.

1535907,A3LSB0HOUROUVV,B007PXYVLO,Peekaboo85024,"[0, 0]","The main movie was with Sam Waterston as Lincoln and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary. Thought the movie was very good. Only drawback as I felt Sam was a little young for a Lincoln role. Felt it captured the insanity of Mary on the death of their son that usually is ignored in other movies. Movie was in 2 parts and covers the White House years. The Appomattox part was a short documentary on the 2 generals of the surrender which was very informative.  Was done in 1988 so does not have the film quality of today but for the price it was a good bargain and was a little different take on the Lincolns then other movies of him. If you are a Lincoln fan you should enjoy it.

1535908,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B007PXYVLO,Richard Masloski,"[1, 1]","If you or someone you know deeply loves or merely likes or simply has some curiosity about our nation's history - and more precisely the history of our Civil War and our most renowned President -  do NOT pass up this one-two knockout of a DVD.  I found it in a veritable trash bin of ready-for-the-dump discount discs in some supermarket.  Way at the bottom it was - but its two-film content puts it way toward the top!The main event is 1988's TV miniseries Gore Vidal's LINCOLN starring Sam Waterston in the titular role and Mary Tyler Moore as a truly manic Mary. This movie covers myriad miles more ground than Spielberg's LINCOLN - and despite Daniel Day-Lewis' Oscar winning turn as Honest Abe, in all honesty Sam Waterston is the much more convincing Lincoln!  OK, he isn't as tall as Day-Lewis or Lincoln - and he was 48 years old when he played the Great Emancipator compared to Day-Lewis' being short of Lincoln's actual age of 56 by one year - but Waterston gives the richer, more nuanced, more natural and even more passionate performance.  The fact that he had a much more sprawling saga of a script helped, of course, but still and all his portrayal is far better than the overly-hyped Lincoln of Day-Lewis.  And apart from this towering performance, the movie itself is the best film yet made about Abraham Lincoln. Sadly, the main attraction isn't a great transfer.  But it isn't unwatchably bad at all once you surrender to the story being told. And the second feature is perfectly fine - and would alone be worth the price of this disc!The second feature is from 1972's TV series APPOINTMENT WITH DESTINY and the episode herein is SURRENDER AT APPOMATTOX.  Shot in a newsreel, cinema verite style in Matthew Brady-esque black-and-white, this YOU ARE THERE-inspired sixty minute episode brings you as close as possible to feeling and seeing things as if you'd time-traveled back to the closing days of the Civil War, culminating with the surrender of Lee to Grant at Appomattox just days before the murder of President Lincoln.  And unlike Martin Sheen's Grey Fox in GETTYSBURG, this voiceless, veritably unknown actor truly looks the part and through facial expression and body language he succeeds admirably in getting us as close to the actuality of the real man as historically and humanly possible.2015 will mark the 150th Anniversary of the end of the War Between the States and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Yet a vast majority has no comprehension or concern for what came before, no desire to learn of that which led to today. The world is too fast anymore to take the time to reflect on its history and its meaning. I cannot recommend this DVD enough, for it can be a small start. It is both entertaining and educational. It might be viewed by the entire family and then discussed amongst parents and their children. It could even help a tiny bit to reintroduce talking rather than... texting. And, in these economically hard-pressed times, at near half a sawbuck, how can you go wrong?P.S.  The man pictured on the cover of the DVD is neither Lincoln nor Waterston nor Sam Waterston as Lincoln. He remains as much a mystery as why this film was buried in that bin wherein I found it in the first place! But then again it is quite a truism that junk floats to the surface - especially in the contemporary cultural ocean!",5,A STERLING STEAL FOR NEAR HALF A SAWBUCK,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,3354,"['someone', 'know', 'deeply', 'loves', 'merely', 'likes', 'simply', 'curiosity', 'nation', 'history', 'more', 'precisely', 'history', 'Civil', 'War', 'most', 'renowned', 'President', 'do', 'NOT', 'pass', 'up', 'one-two', 'knockout', 'DVD', 'found', 'veritable', 'trash', 'bin', 'ready-for-the-dump', 'discount', 'discs', 'supermarket', 'bottom', 'was', 'two-film', 'content', 'way', 'top', 'main', 'event', '1988', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'LINCOLN', 'starring', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'titular', 'role', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'truly', 'manic', 'Mary', 'movie', 'myriad', 'miles', 'more', 'ground', 'Spielberg', 'LINCOLN', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'turn', 'Honest', 'Abe', 'honesty', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'Lincoln', 'OK', ""n't"", 'as', 'tall', 'Day-Lewis', 'Lincoln', 'was', '48', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'played', 'Great', 'Emancipator', 'compared', 'Day-Lewis', 'being', 'short', 'Lincoln', 'actual', 'age', '56', 'one', 'year', 'Waterston', 'richer', 'more', 'nuanced', 'more', 'natural', 'even', 'more', 'passionate', 'performance', 'fact', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'sprawling', 'saga', 'script', 'helped', 'course', 'still', 'portrayal', 'far', 'better', 'overly-hyped', 'Lincoln', 'Day-Lewis', 'apart', 'towering', 'performance', 'movie', 'best', 'film', 'yet', 'made', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Sadly', 'main', 'attraction', ""n't"", 'great', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'unwatchably', 'bad', 'once', 'surrender', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'second', 'feature', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'would', 'alone', 'be', 'price', 'disc', 'second', 'feature', '1972', 'TV', 'series', 'APPOINTMENT', 'WITH', 'DESTINY', 'episode', 'herein', 'SURRENDER', 'AT', 'APPOMATTOX', 'Shot', 'newsreel', 'cinema', 'verite', 'style', 'Matthew', 'Brady-esque', 'black-and-white', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'THERE-inspired', 'sixty', 'minute', 'episode', 'as', 'close', 'possible', 'feeling', 'seeing', 'things', ""'d"", 'time-traveled', 'back', 'closing', 'days', 'Civil', 'War', 'culminating', 'surrender', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'Appomattox', 'just', 'days', 'murder', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Grey', 'Fox', 'GETTYSBURG', 'voiceless', 'veritably', 'unknown', 'actor', 'truly', 'part', 'facial', 'expression', 'body', 'language', 'admirably', 'getting', 'close', 'actuality', 'real', 'man', 'historically', 'humanly', 'possible.2015', 'will', 'mark', '150th', 'Anniversary', 'end', 'War', 'Between', 'States', 'assassination', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'vast', 'majority', 'comprehension', 'concern', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'desire', 'learn', 'led', 'today', 'world', 'too', 'fast', 'anymore', 'take', 'time', 'reflect', 'history', 'meaning', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'enough', 'can', 'be', 'small', 'start', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'might', 'be', 'viewed', 'entire', 'family', 'then', 'discussed', 'amongst', 'parents', 'children', 'could', 'even', 'help', 'tiny', 'bit', 'reintroduce', 'talking', 'rather', 'texting', 'economically', 'hard-pressed', 'times', 'sawbuck', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'P.S', 'man', 'pictured', 'cover', 'DVD', 'Lincoln', 'Waterston', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Lincoln', 'as', 'much', 'mystery', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'buried', 'bin', 'wherein', 'found', 'first', 'place', 'then', 'again', 'quite', 'truism', 'junk', 'floats', 'surface', 'especially', 'contemporary', 'cultural', 'ocean']",Civil War Anniversary Collection: Gore Vidal's Lincoln / The Surrender at Appomattox
