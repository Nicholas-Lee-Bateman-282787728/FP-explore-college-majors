1381932,A19ATJSKDZD9EZ,B0041LULMG,"Adam Stapleton ""drunken sailor""","[3, 6]","Picked this movie up because it was filmed in Georgia and the cover looked really cool.  However, as is often the case, the cover is better than what's inside.  I'm not going to mercilessly thrash this small budget independent film, but I am going to thoroughly refute the previous reviewer who I don't feel gave an objective review of the movie (probably a friend of the film's writer/producer/leading man Gary Weeks.First off, the entire thing looks like it was filmed on about the same 20 acres of public forest, completely eliminating any real sense that it takes place in a post-apocalyptic wastland at all.  I understand they were working on a limited budget, but there are many other creative ways, or more extensive location scouting could have been done, to make the movie not look like it was filmed in a County woodland preserve.Second, the acting/writing is incredibly uneven.  A couple unknowns turn in decent performances inspite of the poor dialogue they're given to work with, but most of the actors, including leading man Gary Weeks, make the movie look more like a college student's film project. Also, what is William Kat doing in this movie?Third, the cinematography is excellent from a technical perspective, but completely devoid of anything interesting when it comes to capturing the viewer.Deadland isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely a movie that if it did not exist, noone who wasn't involved in making it would miss it.  Watching this movie just gives you a mediocre feeling of boredness. It's just ""blah.""  It doesn't even have that ""it's so bad that it's entertaining"" appeal.  There are millions of other movies out there that are far better and far worse and that won't leave you feeling as though you wasted an hour and 47 minutes of your life.",1,Valiant effort.... bland fail.,1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,1798,"['Picked', 'movie', 'up', 'was', 'filmed', 'Georgia', 'cover', 'looked', 'really', 'cool', 'However', 'often', 'case', 'cover', 'better', 'what', 'inside', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'mercilessly', 'thrash', 'small', 'budget', 'independent', 'film', 'am', 'going', 'thoroughly', 'refute', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'gave', 'objective', 'review', 'movie', 'probably', 'friend', 'film', 'writer/producer/leading', 'man', 'Gary', 'Weeks.First', 'entire', 'thing', 'was', 'filmed', 'same', '20', 'acres', 'public', 'forest', 'completely', 'eliminating', 'real', 'sense', 'place', 'post-apocalyptic', 'wastland', 'understand', 'were', 'working', 'limited', 'budget', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'creative', 'ways', 'more', 'extensive', 'location', 'scouting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'make', 'movie', 'not', 'look', 'was', 'filmed', 'County', 'woodland', 'preserve.Second', 'acting/writing', 'incredibly', 'uneven', 'couple', 'unknowns', 'turn', 'decent', 'performances', 'inspite', 'poor', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'given', 'work', 'most', 'actors', 'including', 'leading', 'man', 'Gary', 'Weeks', 'make', 'movie', 'look', 'more', 'college', 'student', 'film', 'project', 'Also', 'what', 'William', 'Kat', 'doing', 'movie', 'Third', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'technical', 'perspective', 'completely', 'devoid', 'anything', 'interesting', 'when', 'capturing', 'viewer.Deadland', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'definitely', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'noone', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'making', 'would', 'miss', 'Watching', 'movie', 'just', 'mediocre', 'feeling', 'boredness', 'just', 'blah', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'so', 'bad', 'entertaining', 'appeal', 'are', 'millions', 'other', 'movies', 'there', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'far', 'worse', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'wasted', 'hour', '47', 'minutes', 'life']",N/A

1381935,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0041LULMG,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","With all the duds I have reviewed as of late,Phase4 films has figured prominently in at least two,so I wasn't expecting much out of this one.Deadlands(released July/09)is a surprisingly decent film.For its low budget it certainly has good direction,this new up and coming crop of actors do a decent job in their characterizations and the music is well composed and certainly helps to elevate the feel of the movie when it needs it most.The plot revolves around one Sean Kalos(Gary Weeks)and his girlfriend Katie Johnson(Emily-Grace Murray)who live in L.A.Sean leaves the city for business and is stopped at a gas station,trying to phone her,but the lines are dead.Outside he witnesses bombs dropping in the distance onto L.A.,very reminiscent of the Ray Milland classic""Panic in year Zero"".Five years on and Sean is alone,trying to survive,and is searching for his lady.The U.S.has been broken into provinces,ruled by ersatz militia men.Women are so much cattle,at the mens disposal and whims,and moved around,when needed,from territory to territory.There are other groups that disagree with the brutal methods used by these provincial military men,and one is called the Voice.Sean,on the run from some provincial militia,falls into a hole inhabited by Jax(Brian Tee),a crazed,Elvis accented Oriental.Jax takes Sean to Shiv(William Katt,remembered by all from The Greatest American Hero,Perry Mason movies and other countless TV and film work).Shiv is THE man to come to to help Sean in his search.Shiv is quite the eccentric,even more quirk filled than Jax.Shiv uncovers a riddle on some papers Sean found,that will possibly lead him to his Katie.Along the way Sean and Jax visit the encampment of the Voice,who just want some of the antibiotics he carries.Farther on he and Jax are captured by the militia of the local province.Jax sells Sean out for a price,and gets his just reward later.Sean is reunited with a ""comfort woman"" he and Jax had previously encountered.She was there because she had ""betrayed"" her guards by letting Sean and Jax escape,and had her tongue removed.The woman now hands Sean a message from Katie.She is in the camp with a group of others that are to be shipped out the next day to another province.A sympathetic militia man helps Sean and the women escape.Sean stands on the path as the women rush by him,until Katie emerges.They reunite but soon have themselves surrounded by the militia and their leader.The leader orders Sean shot and he is.He falls and Katie is captured,to be taken away.But Sean rises off the ground as everyone stares in disbelief.Throughout the film the legend of ""Steele"",a man impervious to bullets and defeating large armies,has been heard.The soldiers think Sean is that man,and as the commanders' admonitions fall on deaf ears,he tries to shoot Sean himself.The sympathetic guard shoots the commander and takes charge.Sean's bravery inspires the soldiers to change their path for the better.I found the film was working not too shabbily until just after we got past William Katts all too short appearance.After this the film drags and is uneven,as the plot takes a circuitous route to its finale.This is an indication of the budget,but the women let loose near the end of the film were the most healthy specimens I had seen up to that point.Few looked bedraggled,let alone dirty,and they were far from diseased.And Brian Tee's terribly heavy Elvis-like snarl,stare and voice,was overall VERY hard to understand,which detracted from what one was watching.It was a decent portrayal,it's just that his annunciation was poor.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and overall looked good.Extras include a featurette,commentary and the trailer.All in all not a bad film by any stretch.The film can't hide its low budget roots of course,but I have to give the entire production team and actors credit for the good job they tried to do with what little they had.It does have its flaws but is an average but watchable film.I give them an E for effort;nice work guys and gals.",3,A not so bad post
