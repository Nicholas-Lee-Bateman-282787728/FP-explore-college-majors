I know, I know, he used to be in a boy band.  Forego the preconceptions.  Listen to this man's music. The three days in Knebworth documented here are legendary already. Observe one of the world's finest entertainers hold half a million people in the palm of his hand. If this doesn't make you want to hear more, I don't know what will.  Knebworth features his big hits, and they are all good, but trust me, some of Williams' finest music is to be found on the b-sides of his singles. He is the whole package: great looking; fabulous entertainer; and extraordinarily talented composer. You will not be disappointed.  He's going to be around for decades.

This concert is the prove that some artist were born to sing nice songs and other ones to make people go crazy. This show is not only Robbie's performance, but it's also the band, chorus, the stage, those beautiful dancers (Kate & Nikky: What a HOT, HOT Girls!!!).I bought this DVD some months ago and I didn't know which songs were included on this. When I saw it, the first thing I liked was the great interactive menu. That's a really good job. Not only for the animations and images, but the sound and background songs. So, at first sight: 5/5Then, the track list. there are almost all Robbie Williams greatest songs. But I regreted two missing: ""MILLENNIUM"" and ""SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL"" (not played in the concert). But after watching this concert I got satisfied. The order of these songs are really nice, starting with ""LET ME ENTERTAIN YOU"", ""WE WILL ROCK YOU"" and going to a wondeful ""MONSOON"". A quieter part of the show comes with ""SHE'S THE ONE"", but it contrast with inmediately played ""SUPREME"". ""KIDS"" and ""HOT FUSGE"" are greatly complemented with those wonderful girls dancing all around the stage... That nice variant on starting of ""ROCK DJ"" really make people shout: ""LAST NIGHT A DJ SAVED MY LIFE"" then Robbie coming up from below the stage and those pretty girls doing their dance around him... The concert finish with a emotive ""ANGELS"". So, my qualification is 5/5Robbie as a showman: Unique. He's always playing and talking to attendance. He's dancing and running, that's a prove of his energy and enthusiasm for giving people more than they espect from him. He's mad when he had, but he's also touched by his emotions as ""FEEL"" shows us.  It's something difficult to explain but Robbie's behavior store many different ways of express his happiness and madness. He even call a girl to kiss her... many things we cannot see in ther concerts. 5/5In conclusion: If you're a Robbie fan, it's your duty buying this DVD. You'll never see him like this again... Thinking twice... You will. But this is a chance to have all those things we couldn't see live and direct. If you're not a Robbie fan or maybe you haven't heard about him, BUY this DVD, to see how a great singer should guide a live show.As Robbie said at Knetworth: THIS IS ROBIE WILLIAMS, THIS IS MY BAND...

784407,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0000V4604,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[8, 9]","This was originally televised on UK TV, and full of adverts. So I was happy to receive the DVD, and watch it all over again, with no adverts. Although I wasn't so happy when I discovered a good chunk of the DVD wasn't the performances that were originally screened on TV - it was better!This was filmed at Knebworth, over 3 days, in the summer, with Robbie playing to 375,000 fans, which averages at 125,000 fans a night. (If they managed to get there on the night, which a few of them didn't, due to the large volume in traffic!) So the TV performance and the DVD had performances taken from all three nights.I was surprised not to be able to find a certificate for this on the DVD, as the TV performance didn't show half of what this did! Robbie swears, he gets one very lucky lady up on stage who he gropes and kisses - I bet all the women watching this, including me, wanted to be in her shoes. Oh, and two girls decide to flash him, and get on camera cos Robbie notices. Of course he's going to notice, they were in the front row. I bet they regret that now.You've got all of Robbie's hits on this DVD - although not going back quite as far as some of his very early solo stuff, when he was still known as the fat dancer from Take That. And he's live, proving he can cut it live, in front of a big audience.There are some great highlights from this concert - Robbie getting overly emotional at all the love the fans are giving him, and performing a `punk' version of Back For Good (Take That) with Mark Owen. If you loved this performance, its in the extras, not included in the actual concert footage. Why they hid it in the extras I'll never know. It's stupid.I did quite often get distracted by Robbie's ever-growing collection of tattoos during the concert - Ozzy Osbourne anyone? But this is a great DVD to keep and reminisce if you were at the concert (I wasn't), or spot yourself if you were. And dance and sing along to all the hits. This was a tremendous concert and shows just what superb entertainer Robbie Williams is.

The show is outstanding and even if you do not like Robbie, you will surely enjoy this DVD.From the opening act, in which Robbie appears like on the cover of his album &quot;Escapology&quot; until the last song, &quot;Angels&quot;, followed by the crowd, Robbie leads the audience throughout his songs.In this DVD, you get some songs which were cut from &quot;Live summer&quot; CD, such as &quot;Supreme&quot;. Robbie was really happy during the performance and talked to his fans between the songs, saying that was the better crowd he ever performed for.The DVD comes with a second disc, with bonus material: an UNICEF movie against children exploration, narrated by Robbie, two fan diaries, showing his fans arriving and camping at Knebworth and other materials about the singer. There's also a game you can play using the remote control of the DVD which gives you access to a special area, with some Robbie takes and a performance of &quot;Back for good&quot;, with his old pal from Take That, Mark Owen.

After seeing Robbie on MTV Europe, I wanted to get more of the SRO performer who seems to be all but known in America.  This DVD will give him to you- irreverent, brash, cheeky- but above all entertaining.  The Knebworth show is a crazy mix of singer concert, rock spectacle, lounge act, LasVegas and Moulin Rouge review- all rolled into one, but well- orchestrated and superbly presented.  The material, which I thought at first would be forgettable, has me now humming its melodies in my head all day long. Is he a pop star, contrived industry creation, MOR headliner?- who cares?  He's the real deal- a first class entertainer who has this audience (all 100,000+ of them) right in the palm of his hand at every moment, thanks to his charismatic charm and expert sense of timing. He is simply riveting. Deserved praise also goes to those who engineered the DVD: the sound and camera shots are excellent, providing perhaps a better experience than the live audience enjoyed, certainly the best recording of a mega concert that I've ever witnessed. This is a package well worth viewing and one I guarantee you'll replay again and again.  Like the man says, for full effect, do play it loud.
