Sure it wasn't 100% accurate, but that didn't take away from the essence of the story. One woman who was destined to save the Jewish race from annhilation at the hands of one man. It's also a love story, but it's different from the ones we're used to.This movie is fun to watch, even if there are mistakes, like in the ending scenes, but that doesn't take away from the story itself. I also liked that some history was added that's not normally put into the story, the side story of the Greeks(which was funny because I had just finished watching 300 right before this) and it helped to set the story a bit.It's also a family movie.

Like a romance novel, misunderstanding mars their way, and it is only at the end, when Hadassah must make her choice that they are reconciled.The story is more focused on the two of them than it is on the original plot, which plays in the background. I strongly suggest that you read the Scriptural version before watching the movie, then use the movie as a stepping off point for discussions. Particularly, from a feminine point of view, a discussion of being forced into a harem, forced to sleep with a stranger, then assigned to live out your life in this setting would be a good place to start.There are women today who, like Esther, are faced with this challenge.

Lappen,"[0, 0]","It's rather unfortunate, to put it mildly, that Tiffany Dupont plays Hadassah, the niece of Mordechai in the tale of the Persian Queen Esther. There's nothing queenly about her, pretty though she may be, and gorgeous in royal robes.Somehow, the trailers that I saw of this movie made it look appealing, and it was a serious disappointment, all the way around. The film has the same 1950s quality asThe Ten Commandments (Special Collector's Edition)with Charlton Heston. Lots of great costumes and kingly head shots, very little worthy acting, and very little Biblical quality.That is really a shame. Because King Xerxes (Luke Goss) looks kingly, what with his nice crowns and specially alluring eye makeup and all, and his ever-so-earnest wish for a truly loving wife.It's also too bad because one really wants, especially, to love Esther's uncle Mordechai (John Rhys-Davies)But the story of Queen Esther is ever so much more dramatic in the Meggilah, the scroll that is read every year on eve of the 14th day of Adar, when Queen Esther successfully plead with the Babylonian king, Xerxes, to save the Jewish people from Haman's plot to destroy them.It's too bad, really.

1027043,A3VZL4M7RMKIFT,B000JJSJO6,Amazon Customer,"[3, 4]","I have mixed feelings on this. For one I adore the actress who plays Esther in this story she is precious. I thought the costumes and the set  were super Persian, so it was a feast for the eyes! I loved how the characters were portrayed..like the Eunuch. He really made the movie..my issue is more with the screen play and probably the novel this was taken from. We were often scratching our head saying ""hmmm what's the point of that discourse????""(this knowing the original story which helped, but if you don't know it, I could see where you might get confused at parts.)  I really appreciate that they were very respectful in the way they portrayed their intimate moments, making it one of the few family movies put out today. That said, why didnt they just stick to the historical records;could they not have studied the Greeks better as well?? Were the Greeks the ones who leveled the playing field for the slaves and had true democracy? (visit MT olympia for a cursory review! They gave us the polis (city/states)but they were not the ones who gave us ""God made man in His image"" = all men , women and slaves are created equal..thats purely Hebrew!)The Persians had the same idealism as the Greeks, so you really didnt have to create this Haman hatred because the Jews were the great fighters of democracy like their Greek enemies ... rather than this revisionist American idea, just the truth would have been so much better!The Jews were a conquered people, so when Mordachi would not bow down to anyone but God..you could see Haman and his hatred of this pompous Jew not bowing to a Persian...that scene would have been much more realistic especially since thats what really did happen! Not only that, but the creation of a misunderstanding of Esther and Xeres really didn't add to the story. For one, we all know that had any king like Xeres suspected infidelity...it would have been ""off with her head"" so that really leaves you with this feeling of it just doesn't smack real..I mean Eunuchs were Eunuchs for that reason right? The actual history was much better. Another example...If you simply laid out who Xeres truly was, you would totally understand ,like the Bible expects you to, why Esther was scared to death! Esther knew she could live or die on his whim, she saw him put people to death every day... you really didn't have to create an elaborate story for her to be scared of him.....it demeans the real story to portray that she walks through the rain, causing a stir in ""Congress"" only to invite him to a dinner party.  So to inject this thinking in there only destroyed the tried and true story which is super exciting and fits our historical facts we know and find every day in the field of archaeology! I normally am very happy for anything that may even sound Christian, But when people start twisting the bible narratives and they make them unrealistic they take real historical documents and turn them into mythology. After knowing the real story, I really felt they had the perfect plot laid out and could have elaborated fictionally within the actual factual things to make this historically accurate and super facinating.

1027044,A2J18HGXQVBVOR,B000JJSJO6,"Angela Hailey ""sableskin""","[2, 4]","As a HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS and well-read cynic of anything from organized religion, my expectations for this movie were nil.  In fact, I only rented it (having never heard of it before) on the basis of its (perhaps) interesting cinematography, and my interest in period pieces. As a long reader of history and politics, I was frankly impressed that someone, anyone, finally decided to acknowledge that Persia is modern-day Iraq. For all those, I'll just say it, RIGHT WING-NUTS ""praying for our president"", isn't it ironic that many of you also love this movie, the setting for which ""your president"" is ""prayerfully""  destroying?  But off my soapbox, I did find the music and the cinematography beautiful.  The script was OK; it was a vehicle to tell a story.  No movie is going to capture the nuances of any religious text to everyone's satisfaction.  Esther seemed a bit silly to me, although the implication was that her early life and her religion had provided her with the wisdom she would later evince.  Perhaps casting her as young as she was cast was an attempt to imbue her actions with conviction, although, as one reviewer noted, her conviction was internal.  I found Xerxes to be distracting b/c he was so peculiar looking, frankly bordering on Halloweenish.  His acting left me unmoved because I found his behavior at odds with what a Persian man should look like.  I agree with some reviewers that there are too many accents, and I will also add, skin tones, floating through this movie to get a clear picture of where it is.  I know where it is supposed to be, but these minor details would leap out at anyone who can appreciate accuracy.  As to the family friendliness of this, I found it highly sexualized with strange directions.  I would hope that any kid old enough to sit through this, would wonder what a eunuch is, and would appreciate that a ""nation-wide"" meat market is NOT the way a wife should be chosen, story line or not.  Furthermore, I would hope that RESPONSIBLE parents would explain to their children exactly what elements are involved in a healthy marriage, physical and otherwise (the movie hinted at this, but would someone PLEASE just some clothes on Xerxes?)The music is phenomenal.

Based on the story of a woman obeying God for the benefit of her people, the Jews, despite the promise of great peril, ""One Night With the King"" misses the mark.Her story is well-known to any student of ancient literature, CCD or Sunday school. It is up there with Jonah, Noah, Adam and Eve, and the death and resurrection of Jesus. Even agnostics and atheists who are versed in the classics can provide the plot. With this, there are expectations: bring a major story to film and treat it properly.With lines that come across stiff and stuffy, characters become cartoons, and do not live as real people. How can we believe actors speaking in a mock Shakespearean dialect? I couldn't.Esther was flirtatious, flighty and yet bold from the first moment. Her character reminded me of Princess Jasmine in Disney's ""Aladdin."" This is not the unassuming future leader we read about, but a different Esther. When the grand decision must be made, she does not struggle in mortal angst as did the biblical version.The plot itself didn't merit a long movie. A shorter piece, maybe 90 minutes, would have sufficed.I felt like I was watching ""The Robe,"" in all its effort to send a message, gets lost in a mediocre script.Esther is a great story in its original form that has incredible big screen potential.

Based off the book ""Hadassah"" by authors Tommy Tenney and Mark Andrew Olson, the movie has an all star cast with Tiffany Dupont as Hadassah and later as Esther, the incredibly handsome Luke Goss as King Xerxes, John Rhys-Davies as Mordecai, and brief apperances by Omar Sharif and in my opinion we see to little of the wonderful Peter O'Toole.King Xerxes after dismissing his first wife is pressed by the other princes of his provinces to pick another bride to hold the kingdom together while he is off warring against the Greeks. It doesn't take long for the king to realize that Esther who is jewish but is hiding it, not only has the will to do what she wants, but she also has the power over his heart. After they marry things start to slowly fall apart, mainly by the man Haman the Agagite. Soon the state decrees that all Jews should be put to death so King Xerxes will have enough gold to cover the cost of the war with the Greeks, which soon leaves Esther's life in danger. Defying the warnings of others, Esther struggles to save her people even though it may end up costing her her life. Will Esther struggles be in vain, or will King Xerxes realize the error of his decision and does he have the courage and the faith to believe in his wife as she struggles to find out just how far she will go to fullfill her destiny.",5,How Will You Find Your Destiny?,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,1434,"['lush', 'cinematography', 'fantastic', 'score', 'One', 'Night', 'King', 'will', 'leave', 'mesmerized', 'Based', 'off', 'book', 'Hadassah', 'authors', 'Tommy', 'Tenney', 'Mark', 'Andrew', 'Olson', 'movie', 'star', 'cast', 'Tiffany', 'Dupont', 'Hadassah', 'later', 'Esther', 'incredibly', 'handsome', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'King', 'Xerxes', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'Mordecai', 'brief', 'apperances', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'opinion', 'see', 'little', 'wonderful', 'Peter', ""O'Toole.King"", 'Xerxes', 'dismissing', 'first', 'wife', 'pressed', 'other', 'princes', 'provinces', 'pick', 'bride', 'hold', 'kingdom', 'together', 'warring', 'Greeks', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'king', 'realize', 'Esther', 'who', 'jewish', 'hiding', 'not', 'only', 'will', 'do', 'what', 'also', 'power', 'heart', 'marry', 'things', 'start', 'slowly', 'fall', 'apart', 'mainly', 'man', 'Haman', 'Agagite', 'Soon', 'state', 'decrees', 'Jews', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'death', 'so', 'King', 'Xerxes', 'will', 'have', 'enough', 'gold', 'cover', 'cost', 'war', 'Greeks', 'soon', 'Esther', 'life', 'danger', 'Defying', 'warnings', 'others', 'Esther', 'save', 'people', 'even', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'costing', 'life', 'Will', 'Esther', 'struggles', 'be', 'vain', 'will', 'King', 'Xerxes', 'realize', 'error', 'decision', 'have', 'courage', 'faith', 'believe', 'wife', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'fullfill', 'destiny']",One Night with the King

It is beautiful.  I immediately wanted to read the book of Ester ... and I did all in one sitting.  Like most films the book is better than the movie.  I'm not sure why the director/writers decided not to follow the story line in the Bible.  In the Book of Ester the King wasn't harsh with her except in one instance - he gave her an angry look.  His love for her was passsionate.  In the movie he was made to seem to hate her at times, and was lost in confusion over her ... which is not present in the Bible.  Also, in the movie Haman is mockingly begging for his life, but in the Bible Haman is very seriously begging for his life ""for he saw that evil was determined against him by the King.""  Admittedly, I am not a historian and have never studied the book of Ester.The thing is this.  I watched this movie once. When it ended I wanted to watch it again immediately.  That rarely happens.  The second time I watched it with my daughter, age 17.  When it ended she said, ""I want to watch it again right now ... start it over!""  I told her that was my reaction as well.  She also said, ""I didn't know there were such good stories in the Bible.  I wish they would make them all into movies ... then I could learn about the Bible.""Most important to note, this movie changed how I talk to the Lord.  The deep faith of Ester portrayed in this movie (excellent job by actress/ director/all envolved) caused me to know that when I pray I AM before God.  Ester's intense humility before her king caused me to feel an intense humility before my King.  Now, when I pray I know I am standing humbly before His throne in His presence.  It's a good feeling to know the King receives your petitions.  This I honestly got from the movie ... not the book.Ask yourself, If it is possible for this woman to obtain a profound closeness to God in her prayer life, to be moved to read the Bible, and for her 17 year old daughter to now long to hear the beautiful stories of the Bible, what are the possibilities for me? for my family?

It turned out to be close. It does come off like a movie from the 1950's where everyone is clean and there are no flies or elements that would have been found in the time of Esther.  But I tried to overlook this and concentrate on the story line.Also know that the Star of David shown in the movie as she holds a necklace up to a candle and its prism casts a Star of David image on the area is not Biblical. In fact it wasn't until the 17th century that the star became known as a Jewish symbol. Thus this part of the movie is total myth.Would have been nice to see more notice made of Mordechai who declared the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the Hebrew month of Adar as days of rejoicing, as the feast of Purim, which Jews today still celebrate in February or March, depending on if its a leap year. But its a side note at the end of the movie.Anyway, the cinematography is magical, like in Lord of the Rings, or even Gladiator. But unlike those movies this is a very G rated movie, with no violence, even thought the period of Esther was extremely violent.  Had someone like Stephen Spielberg made the movie one would have see fighting and alas even the reality, of the executions, including those of Haman and his sons. King Xerxes played by Luke Goss come off 80% nicer than he was in history.  Tommy Lister as Hegai is wonderful, if only for his voice.Tiffany DuPont does a good job as Hadassah/Esther, even if I think she was made to look to giddy at times, and wasn't as old as the historical Esther.  Was nice to see Peter O'Toole as Samuel, the Prophet, and Omar Sharif as Prince MemucanThe whole God and venegance against anyone who dared harm the Jews, was missing, and barely touched upon in my opinion.  Again it is much like the Bible movies on the 1950's, and I wish it had been more realistic. This was if anyone reads the Jewish texts a very violent period.

Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[7, 9]","ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING is a pleasant surprise and a very entertaining and educational Bible movie!Before I saw it, I was worried about the title, ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING, and I was concerned that the filmmakers would focus on the first night that Esther spends with the King, she being part of his harem. I was also wondering about the lead actress being too lightweight. I am glad that I was wrong to worry about either of these things, everything went very well with the film!The first night with the king is done very tastefully and very ABSENT of any unacceptable, too extreme, physical relationship scenes which are too typical in most other secular movies. In fact, there is a definite LACK of lewdness, though the love and romance is tastefully and believably developed.I like the two supporting actors from THE LORD OF THE RINGS films, the actors who played Gimli the dwarf and the mad father of Boromir and Faramir do well in their smaller roles here.Tiffany Dupont starts the film seeming to be too lightweight, but her performance gets better and better as the film progresses and builds to its dramatic conclusion. I was wrong to think she was not up to playing the role of Esther, she is very good, after all!As far as Bible accuracy goes, I am impressed! I felt they dwelt too long on made up characters and scenes that only made the main plot more confusing. But after I watched the film, I took the time to read through the Bible's book of Esther, again, and I was impressed that most of the minor characters are mentioned by name in the Bible, and often with brief mentions of doing things in the story, which are shown in the film, and I did not realize how accurate the movie really was until verifying it with the Bible itself!That's what I like about good Bible movies, it makes it easier to picture and remember many Bible passages and details, and I REALLY like it when a film is more accurate than my memory! ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING is pretty good at Bible accuracy.There are a few things that are added unnecessarily, but they don't mess up the main plot. For instance, they try to come up with a reason why Haman hates the Jews, and they give Esther a puppy love boyfriend before she gets taken to the harem, but though these things are wrong, I forgive them since while I was watching the film, I thought I was catching a whole lot more fabrication which turned out to be in the Bible after all, so this film helped me learn and remember more about the book of Esther. The good outweighs the irritating, as far as I am concerned about ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING.The DVD extras are non-existent, but if you like accurate Bible stories, you will get your money's worth, in my opinion.There is another great DVD movie of Esther, featuring Ben Kingsley as Mordecai, entitled ESTHER, and I can highly recommend that DVD as well! That ESTHER movie is about 10 years old, but the actors are more skilled and there is less additions to the Scripture story, though the film budget is not as high as ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING.

I will not complain about the audibility because I deliberately set the subtitles on all films these days for that very reason. They were very helpful, even though some of the history was so convoluted that even though I am a Bible scholar, the logic was lost on me as to why Esther was so insistent upon going to Jerusalem that she left home, and then decided, when the opportunity presented itself to spend one night with the King, that she didn't want to go after all - even though her best friend (and potential lover) had been castrated by said King's army. I've always been rather partial to Vashti, who stood up to the King and refused to endorse his war. Near the end of the movie, Esther seems to empathize with Vashti and shows concern for her banishment - but that is not in Scripture, and does Vashti no favors at that point.But, it was entertaining, I will give it that. Don't use it for Bible class. Not necessarily a date movie, unless you are dating a Born Again Fundamentalist.

Though at times hokey (the king wears a lot of make-up and there are several gratuitous muscle scenes that made me laugh), the artistic license used to create and develop the relationship between the king and Esther is great.  I loved the historical prelude--never knew where Haman (may his name be blotted out!) came from.  I also liked the movie's portrayal of pride in the G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  The scene of the queen walking through the king's court is intense!  The movie departs from the Biblical account here and there, but so what!

It sticks to the Biblical account fairly well and shows why what Esther did was so brave.  Nowadays it seems strange that her going to speak to her own husband was such a scandalous thing, but this movie really shows what admiration it took; given the constraints of the time period.

1027065,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,B000JJSJO6,Char,"[2, 3]","A very Romantic retelling of the Biblical story of Esther. An attempt to bring back the great old genre of Bible epics like ""The Ten Commandments.""  Great, well-known actors are enlisted in the effort:  Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, John Rhys-Davies, John Noble.  Be forewarned that O'Toole's appearance is very brief.  The more extensive roles of the other three actors are excellently acted.  For me, the not well-known Luke Goss was just right and very attractive as King Xerxes.  He had great charisma in the part.  The unknown Tiffany Dupont as Esther was, in my view, just ""good.""  Not superb. I loved Tommy Lister as Hegai, Esther's eunuch mentor and friend; was glad the movie-makers extended that part and made it important throughout much of the story.  The sets, costumes, and music supported the ""epic spectacle"" very beautifully.  I did take exception to the hair-do and costume that Esther wore in her first official night with the king, and in the scene where she enters the throne room against protocol.  I think the costumers meant for her to appear attractive in a plain and simple way, but, instead, she just looked odd because of the peculiar cut of the dress. The set of the palace, according to a program I saw on TV, was that of an actual palace in India, although some views of it must have been computer-generated. The waterfall walls of the computer-made palace were unique and striking.  The throne room of Xerxes was spectacular with those huge, rampant lions which seemed to echo the king's physique.  (Or did he echo theirs?)The scene where Esther enters the throne room against protocol, for which she can be killed, is extra dramatic, terrific!The movie adheres rather closely to the Biblical story except for using the dramatic device of a special holographic Star-of-David necklace cherished by Esther as a childhood gift from her parents.  It figures crucially in the plot and in Esther's destiny.  I liked this innovation, and didn't mind this tinkering with the basic story since it didn't change any of the essential meaning of Esther's history.In order to serve the basic meaning of Esther's destiny, the movie should have established a stronger connection between Esther and the Jewish people, and it should have established a stronger connection between Esther and God.The message of the film was chiefly that Esther was chosen for a special destiny, that of saving the Jewish people, but that she also had to make a choice of her own will in order to take on her destiny.  As the choice involved the possible loss of her life, it took great faith and courage.  Having viewed a lot of the promotion for the movie, I know that the movie producers hoped to imply that all people have special destinies and must make courageous choices, however insignificant may be the circumstances of their lives.I may be wrong, but I had the feeling in 2 or 3 scenes that the movie-makers were copying aspects of The Lord of the Rings films, and I did not like them to do that.",4,"""Esther,"" successful here as a great love story.",1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,3000,"['very', 'Romantic', 'retelling', 'Biblical', 'story', 'Esther', 'attempt', 'bring', 'back', 'great', 'old', 'genre', 'Bible', 'epics', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Great', 'well-known', 'actors', 'are', 'enlisted', 'effort', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'John', 'Noble', 'Be', 'forewarned', ""O'Toole"", 'appearance', 'very', 'brief', 'more', 'extensive', 'roles', 'other', 'three', 'actors', 'are', 'excellently', 'acted', 'not', 'well-known', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'very', 'attractive', 'King', 'Xerxes', 'had', 'great', 'charisma', 'part', 'unknown', 'Tiffany', 'Dupont', 'Esther', 'was', 'view', 'just', 'good', 'Not', 'superb', 'loved', 'Tommy', 'Lister', 'Hegai', 'Esther', 'eunuch', 'mentor', 'friend', 'was', 'glad', 'movie-makers', 'extended', 'part', 'made', 'important', 'much', 'story', 'sets', 'costumes', 'music', 'supported', 'epic', 'spectacle', 'very', 'beautifully', 'did', 'take', 'exception', 'hair-do', 'costume', 'Esther', 'wore', 'first', 'official', 'night', 'king', 'scene', 'where', 'throne', 'room', 'protocol', 'think', 'costumers', 'meant', 'appear', 'attractive', 'plain', 'simple', 'way', 'instead', 'just', 'looked', 'odd', 'peculiar', 'cut', 'dress', 'set', 'palace', 'according', 'program', 'saw', 'TV', 'was', 'actual', 'palace', 'India', 'views', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'computer-generated', 'waterfall', 'walls', 'computer-made', 'palace', 'were', 'unique', 'striking', 'throne', 'room', 'Xerxes', 'was', 'spectacular', 'huge', 'rampant', 'lions', 'seemed', 'echo', 'king', 'physique', 'did', 'echo', 'scene', 'where', 'Esther', 'throne', 'room', 'protocol', 'can', 'be', 'killed', 'extra', 'dramatic', 'terrific', 'movie', 'rather', 'closely', 'Biblical', 'story', 'using', 'dramatic', 'device', 'special', 'holographic', 'Star-of-David', 'necklace', 'cherished', 'Esther', 'childhood', 'gift', 'parents', 'crucially', 'plot', 'Esther', 'destiny', 'liked', 'innovation', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'tinkering', 'basic', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'essential', 'meaning', 'Esther', 'history.In', 'order', 'serve', 'basic', 'meaning', 'Esther', 'destiny', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'established', 'stronger', 'connection', 'Esther', 'Jewish', 'people', 'should', 'have', 'established', 'stronger', 'connection', 'Esther', 'God.The', 'message', 'film', 'was', 'chiefly', 'Esther', 'was', 'chosen', 'special', 'destiny', 'saving', 'Jewish', 'people', 'also', 'had', 'make', 'choice', 'own', 'will', 'order', 'take', 'destiny', 'choice', 'involved', 'possible', 'loss', 'life', 'took', 'great', 'faith', 'courage', 'Having', 'viewed', 'lot', 'promotion', 'movie', 'know', 'movie', 'producers', 'hoped', 'imply', 'people', 'have', 'special', 'destinies', 'must', 'make', 'courageous', 'choices', 'however', 'insignificant', 'may', 'be', 'circumstances', 'lives.I', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'had', 'feeling', '2', '3', 'scenes', 'movie-makers', 'were', 'copying', 'aspects', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'do']",One Night with the King
1027066,AB34G6VKP28L,B000JJSJO6,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[3, 3]","One of my favorite stories as a child was that of Esther, the courageous Jewish woman who lived every woman's secret dream... to be taken from obscurity and made a queen of the realm. It was no simple story, for God had intended for her to be put in place for a particular reason. I have often wished that someone would transform this miraculous story into a feature film worthy of praise. Well, someone finally has.The kingdom of Persia lies beneath the threat of impending war, but unaffected by the decisions of monarchs and princes are the lower class. Hadassah (Tiffany Dupont) is a witty, carefree young woman whose sole desire is to travel to Jerusalem, the land of her fathers. This long is taken every year with the caravans that pass through the magnificent city for trade, and her uncle Mordecai (John Rhys-Davies) has promised that one day she may go. Reluctant to let her go on her own, and unwilling to relinquish his position as a scribe in the king's court, Mordecai can no longer turn down her pleas and agrees that she might go, along with her friend Jesse (Jonah Lotan). Little does he realize that the court of King Xerxes (Luke Goss) is torn with strife and turmoil. Despite knowing that his wife is against the impending battle, the king demands her presence at his banquet.When Queen Vashti refuses, the king's council Prince Admantha (John Noble) seeks to use her disobedience to his own advantage. Encouraging the king to disown his wife and choose another more worthy woman, he hopes to influence the outcome and hold power in the monarchy. The youngest, most beautiful single women of the realm are removed from their homes and families and taken to the palace, Hadassah among them. Concerned her heritage might place her life in peril, Mordecai encourages Hadassah to embrace the customs of her newfound life. ""Esther"" humbly asks for the guidance of the head eunuch (Tommy Lister) in how best to impress the king, never fathoming that her childish yearnings for greatness are about to come true... There is such a wealth of rich storytelling potential in this scripture passage that I am surprised it has never been explored before, but other recent attempts through television miniseries and specials have nothing in comparison to this exquisitely lavish production.Christian films have been until now poorly written, badly acted, and cheap in appearance, but One Night With the King dispels all of earlier notions and can compete with the best in secular Hollywood. The costumes are breathtaking. The computer-generated images of Persia are completely realistic. The acting is fabulous, and while the appearances of certain characters do take a little getting used to, the fact remains that it all stands on a very strong script. The best of the novel has been translated to the big screen, with as much drama, potential scandal, and romance as is possible in a two hour film. They did skimp on certain details but overall the story is rich in flavor and true to history. My single complaint would be that at times it is difficult to follow the labyrinth of subplots, particularly those revolving around Prince Admantha. I felt a little lost on several occasions. It's a wonderful film, even if I have to suspend my disbelief that all Esther did in the King's presence was read a scroll...",4,"Lovely ""Fairy Tale"" Version of Esther",1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3320,"['One', 'favorite', 'stories', 'child', 'was', 'Esther', 'courageous', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'woman', 'secret', 'dream', 'be', 'taken', 'obscurity', 'made', 'queen', 'realm', 'was', 'simple', 'story', 'God', 'had', 'intended', 'be', 'put', 'place', 'particular', 'reason', 'have', 'often', 'wished', 'someone', 'would', 'transform', 'miraculous', 'story', 'feature', 'film', 'worthy', 'praise', 'Well', 'someone', 'finally', 'has.The', 'kingdom', 'Persia', 'threat', 'impending', 'war', 'unaffected', 'decisions', 'monarchs', 'princes', 'are', 'lower', 'class', 'Hadassah', 'Tiffany', 'Dupont', 'witty', 'carefree', 'young', 'woman', 'sole', 'desire', 'travel', 'Jerusalem', 'land', 'fathers', 'long', 'taken', 'year', 'caravans', 'pass', 'magnificent', 'city', 'trade', 'uncle', 'Mordecai', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'promised', 'one', 'day', 'may', 'go', 'Reluctant', 'let', 'go', 'own', 'unwilling', 'relinquish', 'position', 'scribe', 'king', 'court', 'Mordecai', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'turn', 'down', 'pleas', 'might', 'go', 'friend', 'Jesse', 'Jonah', 'Lotan', 'Little', 'realize', 'court', 'King', 'Xerxes', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'torn', 'strife', 'turmoil', 'knowing', 'wife', 'impending', 'battle', 'king', 'presence', 'banquet.When', 'Queen', 'Vashti', 'king', 'council', 'Prince', 'Admantha', 'John', 'Noble', 'use', 'disobedience', 'own', 'advantage', 'Encouraging', 'king', 'disown', 'wife', 'choose', 'more', 'worthy', 'woman', 'influence', 'outcome', 'hold', 'power', 'monarchy', 'youngest', 'most', 'beautiful', 'single', 'women', 'realm', 'are', 'removed', 'homes', 'families', 'taken', 'palace', 'Hadassah', 'Concerned', 'heritage', 'might', 'place', 'life', 'peril', 'Mordecai', 'Hadassah', 'embrace', 'customs', 'newfound', 'life', 'Esther', 'humbly', 'guidance', 'head', 'eunuch', 'Tommy', 'Lister', 'how', 'best', 'impress', 'king', 'never', 'fathoming', 'childish', 'yearnings', 'greatness', 'are', 'come', 'true', 'such', 'wealth', 'rich', 'storytelling', 'potential', 'scripture', 'passage', 'am', 'surprised', 'never', 'been', 'explored', 'other', 'recent', 'attempts', 'television', 'miniseries', 'specials', 'have', 'nothing', 'comparison', 'exquisitely', 'lavish', 'production.Christian', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'now', 'poorly', 'written', 'badly', 'acted', 'cheap', 'appearance', 'One', 'Night', 'King', 'dispels', 'earlier', 'notions', 'can', 'compete', 'best', 'secular', 'Hollywood', 'costumes', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'computer-generated', 'images', 'Persia', 'are', 'completely', 'realistic', 'acting', 'fabulous', 'appearances', 'certain', 'characters', 'do', 'take', 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'fact', 'very', 'strong', 'script', 'best', 'novel', 'been', 'translated', 'big', 'screen', 'as', 'much', 'drama', 'potential', 'scandal', 'romance', 'possible', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'did', 'skimp', 'certain', 'details', 'overall', 'story', 'rich', 'flavor', 'true', 'history', 'single', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'times', 'difficult', 'follow', 'labyrinth', 'subplots', 'particularly', 'revolving', 'around', 'Prince', 'Admantha', 'felt', 'little', 'lost', 'several', 'occasions', 'wonderful', 'film', 'even', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'Esther', 'did', 'King', 'presence', 'was', 'read', 'scroll']",One Night with the King

1027071,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B000JJSJO6,Crystal Starr Light,"[6, 7]","I saw the trailers for this and was impressed.  A new movie about Esther?  Well, surely that ought to be interesting.People familiar with the book, Esther, of the Bible will know the basic plot of this book.  King Xerxes of Persia looks for a new queen.  Esther is one of the many chosen to present herself in One Night with the King.  Will he accept her as queen?  And what can a Jewish woman do in this position?Although there was much I despised, I did enjoy the performances of the eunuch and John Rhys Davies.  I could associate with both characters and felt each did a good job with his material.As for the rest of the film, there is so much to dislike, I had to put it in list form:1.  Tiffany Dupont.  Honestly, her interpretation of Esther was poor.  She acts far too modern, far too childish for her own good, far too ""goody-too-shoes"".  Women of this time don't campaign to leave by themselves for another country.  I doubt Esther would be able to read; most women of this day weren't taught how to read (most men couldn't read).2.  The entire story of Esther is skewed.  Suddenly, the story of Esther has a war, a campaign against Greeks and democracy, many new characters (Jesse and Admantha), scenes were Esther reads to Xerxes before her Night.  I can understand that some liberties will be taken, but the war is completely unnecessary and silly.  I have no idea why the Greeks and democracy angle must be thrown in.3.  The mysterious pendant.  Really, what is the point of this?  Talk about taking credit away from God and placing it in an inanimate object.4.  Melodramatic music.  Need I say anymore?  It ranges from goofy little melodies to over-pompous ""Battle themes"".5.  Modern views of marriage and love.  Love and marriage as we know it didn't exist back then.  People back in that day regularly married for money or because of arrangements and very rarely for love.  Why must movies, specifically this one, cheapen the story by inserting reciprocated love and traditional marriage?  Also, it isn't made clear in the movie, but each woman had ""One Night with the King"" so the King may have his way with her, not for her to show off some talent of hers.  Then, the women would be placed in the harem, never to see the King again unless he called for her.6.  Costumes. They look really cool, but are they really Persian?  Half the time, I feel they appear more Indian than Middle Eastern.7.  The actor chosen to be Xerxes is really bland and boring as mud.All in all, the people who would like this movie most would be the ones who will see how far the story veers from the one in the Bible and be turned off.

As a stand-alone love story it has drama and beauty, it really makes no serious attempt to be a movie version of the Book of Esther.True, many elements of the Biblical Esther are there, but they are freely enhanced by the imaginations of those involved in writing the screenplay. If the viewer can set aside the Biblical Esther and accept the premises of the movie, viewing it can be an enjoyable time. At times the movie can be hard to follow and seems to jump around a bit; if one can overlook these moments and just move on with the flow of the movie those interludes are tolerable.Tiffany Dupont does bring a youthful, enthusiastic and tender Esther to the screen whose beauty leaves little question about the king's choice of her to be his next queen. Luke Goss plays King Xerxes as a more sensitive soul pressured by circumstances but responding with balance. The other supporting roles are well cast and acted by very capable actors so there is no shortage of convincing performances.If one views the movie with an open mind and specifically avoids direct comparison with the Book of Esther one should find it a reasonably enjoyable experience.

The narration asserts that God told King Saul to kill all of the Amalekites, men, women and children (including infants) and all of their animals because the Amalekites were (get ready for it) child sacrificers. At least that was what was implied by calling them ""...an ancient, child sacrificing enemy.""Actually, according to the bible, God's reason for wanting the Amalekites killed was because they had opposed the hebrews coming into Israel.  No mention of child sacrificing.  If you want the exact quote, here it is, ""Thus says the Lord of Hosts, 'I will punish the Amalekites for what they did opposing the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.  Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.' "" (1 Samuel 15, 2)According to biblical sources, there is no reason to suppose that the Amalekites ever sacrificed children.  In fact, it is said that they too had been nomads like the hebrews and it was suggested that they were descendants of Esau, brother of Jacob.Really, after watching a depiction of supposed God induced genocide, no matter how excused by modern apologists (child sacrificers indeed), I'm supposed to be on the Israelites' side against a descendant of the last surviving Amalekite? And I'm supposed to accept that the Israelites deserved God's punishment because King Saul disobeyed God by sparing that one last Amalekite? There was one very scary review posted here that seemed to suggest that if ""God"" tells you to, you'd better committ genocide or else.  But that is also what the movie makers seem to be implying as well.I'm sorry but that is insane.  There were other ways it could have been handled without accepting the primitive bloodthirsty desert deity in 1 Samuel as a true depiction of God. At the very least let there be a suggestion that Haman had a very good reason for wanting revenge for his people.  But no, the poor Amalkelites have to be smeared as ""child sacrificers"" so their slaughter can be made more palatable to modern audiences.  And they call this ""Christian"" film making?

My family was glad we could actually see a movie without trash of immoral sexuality, without profanities, and something that generically pursued a Biblical account.  But liberty was taken with the Biblical account of Esther, for sure!  This is more of a romance-novel style telling of Esther. Playing w/ the Text...is something we don't like, though we don't mind filling-in-the unknown blanks type moments.  We don't like it when commentators/authors tried to ""help God's story line out a bit with more pep & spice for a 'better story'.""Yes, errors were made, and too much liberty was taken at times with the Text.  As one reviewer wrote, you really don't need to spice up the true Biblical account of the Book of Esther...it stands out for itself as FULL of all kinds of spice!We saw this at the theatre, a rarity to go to movies that are ""safe"" for Biblical families.  We bought this for home, but later regreted it and tossed it.  The spirituality is SO lacking in this film, it's more of a hero-cinderella-bad guy film with ""Biblical tones.""  The spirituality of the actors, who are supposed to be talking to the God of Israel, is very weak.  Haman is a bit commical, in his evil approach (intentional, apparently).Finally, we RECOMMEND a MUCH MORE Biblically accurate (very close) movie on Purim, from ""The Bible"" series films.  The one in particular that tells this Biblical account, and is quite enjoyable and authentic feeling, and spiritual, is ""The Bible - Esther (2000).""  If you buy that version, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.

He continually alludes to the false alliance of the Jews with the Greeks and their plans to introduce democracy, pouring scorn on both the Jewish G-D and Greek democracy.Very grand and majestic settings and a brilliant cast.Luke Goss adds force to the role of Xerxes and the beautiful Indian actress Jyoti Dogra is perfect in the role of the proud and tragic Queen Vashti.Several elements of intrigue are added to the story such as the plottings by Prince Admantha (John Noble) and Haman. Admantha is outwitted by Haman who rises to become Xerxe's prime minister.Haman's plans to slaughter all the Jews in Persia, and building of a huge gallows erected for Mordecai who had refused to bow before Haman, thus incurring Haman's rage and hate.Hadassah's pain and strength shine forth as she eventually manages to expose Haman and reveal herself as a Jewess - Hadassah Bat Abihail, to the beautiful scene of the appearance of the Stars of David floating across the horizon. The Star of David will triumph over all of Israel's enemies.She persuades Xerxes to cancel the evil decree of genocide.The scene where Haman is caught by Xerxes in Hadassah's chamber has an added element of violence as Haman is actually caught strangling Hadassah by an enraged Xerxes, before being sent to his death.Always we are reminded of the theme of the struggle of the Nation of Israel to survive through the millenia of persecution, where in each generation, a new enemy arises to try and annihilate the Jewish people.At the end of the movie Mordecai is appointed the King's Chief Minister, and decrees the right of the Jews to rise up and defend themselves against those who aim to annihilate them.

This isn't that movie.Although ""One Night With the King"" is blessed with a far larger production budget than most Christian films, the bigger bucks do not translate into a compelling story.  Based on a novel (not just the Biblical book of Esther), the script changes the story too much.  I'm willing to grant a certain amount of artistic license to fill in some of the details, but the screenwriters have actually CHANGED important parts of the story.  Haman's appearance at Esther's banquet gets completely turned on its head.  Instead of begging for his life, he mocks and insults her!  The writers also threw in a Jewish love interest to further ""improve"" the story.  Of course, his being made a eunuch (ouch!) didn't help his chances.In addition, this production glosses over the fact that Esther was part of a harem.  I doubt that she spent her ""One Night With the King"" reading him boring documents from the Persian archives as this film presents!  Obviously the producers wanted this to be family-friendly entertainment, but there must have been SOME creative way to portray Esther's true situation without being tawdry.I thought the performances were pretty good, although Tiffany Dupont portrays Esther as some kind of flighty airhead in the first part of the movie.  When she becomes the queen her performance improves, though, and it's at least conceivable that Xerxes would view her as more than just a sex object.  I guess the fact that the movie portrays her competition for the king's affection as a bunch of total nitwits helped, too (one of those ""bad date"" montages popular in romantic comedies would have been a hoot here).The musical score was good, and so was the CGI -- most of the time.  The panoramic shots of the city looked awesome (though probably not historically accurate) but some of the sweeping shots of the Persian army encampment had that ""drawn"" look.Alas, despite decent production values it's story and characters that make or break a movie, and ""One Night With the King"" falls way short on that score.",2,Too much artistic license,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,2142,"['Biblical', 'story', 'Esther', 'tremendous', 'tale', 'courage', 'faith', 'could', 'make', 'great', 'movie', ""n't"", 'movie.Although', 'One', 'Night', 'King', 'blessed', 'far', 'larger', 'production', 'budget', 'most', 'Christian', 'films', 'bigger', 'bucks', 'do', 'not', 'translate', 'compelling', 'story', 'Based', 'novel', 'not', 'just', 'Biblical', 'book', 'Esther', 'script', 'story', 'too', 'much', ""'m"", 'willing', 'grant', 'certain', 'amount', 'artistic', 'license', 'fill', 'details', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'actually', 'CHANGED', 'important', 'parts', 'story', 'Haman', 'appearance', 'Esther', 'banquet', 'completely', 'turned', 'head', 'Instead', 'begging', 'life', 'insults', 'writers', 'also', 'threw', 'Jewish', 'love', 'interest', 'further', 'improve', 'story', 'course', 'being', 'made', 'eunuch', 'ouch', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'chances.In', 'addition', 'production', 'fact', 'Esther', 'was', 'part', 'harem', 'doubt', 'spent', 'One', 'Night', 'King', 'reading', 'boring', 'documents', 'Persian', 'film', 'Obviously', 'producers', 'wanted', 'be', 'family-friendly', 'entertainment', 'there', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'SOME', 'creative', 'way', 'portray', 'Esther', 'true', 'situation', 'being', 'tawdry.I', 'thought', 'performances', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'Tiffany', 'Dupont', 'Esther', 'kind', 'flighty', 'airhead', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'When', 'queen', 'performance', 'though', 'least', 'conceivable', 'Xerxes', 'would', 'view', 'more', 'just', 'sex', 'object', 'guess', 'fact', 'movie', 'competition', 'king', 'affection', 'bunch', 'total', 'nitwits', 'helped', 'too', 'one', 'bad', 'date', 'montages', 'popular', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hoot', 'here', '.The', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'good', 'so', 'was', 'CGI', 'most', 'time', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'city', 'looked', 'awesome', 'probably', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'Persian', 'army', 'encampment', 'had', 'drawn', 'look.Alas', 'decent', 'production', 'story', 'characters', 'make', 'break', 'movie', 'One', 'Night', 'King', 'way', 'short', 'score']",One Night with the King

The visuals are astounding (get the complete screenplay by Stephen Blinn, co-writer of ""Megiddo: The Omega Code 2"" with John Fasano, which is an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie, combined with the original script; some things in the finished film differ from what was written-I will not launch into details about what was cut and where; a ""Director's Cut"" DVD is definitely in order here) and the acting, led by an all-star cast and newcomer Tiffany Dupont (as Esther) is first-rate. Despite top billing, Peter O'Toole (""Lawrence Of Arabia"") only appears for one minute, in the film's prologue, as the prophet Samuel. Blink and you'll miss him. Luke Goss (the Creature in 2004's Hallmark TV version of ""Frankenstein"") is appropriately wimpy as Xerxes I (brush up on your history if you're confused). John Rhys-Davies (""Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"" ""Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade,"" ""The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy"") is excellent as Mordecai ben Jair, Esther's uncle and adoptive father. John Noble (the evil Denethor in ""The Return Of The King"") oozes menace as Admantha, Prince Of The Face. As usual, Omar Sharif (""Lawrence Of Arabia,"" ""Dr. Zhivago"") is perfect as Memucan, Xerxes' general and father figure. And of course, Tiffany Dupont shines in her film debut as the lovely Esther. The film also makes references to the fate of Darius I, (who was killed in battle against the Greeks), Xerxes' father, and the coming war with Greece, which is known as the battle of Salamis (at which Xerxes was defeated and which brought about the downfall of the Persian Empire).

1027105,A2OP1HD9RGX5OW,B000JJSJO6,"Jedidiah Palosaari ""Not My Real Name""","[18, 26]","The acting in this movie is atrocious.  John Ryhs-Davies, Omar Sharif, and Peter O'Toole (all ten seconds of on-screen time) are great.  Everyone else seems to not know their motivation or what to do with their hands.  If they need to express an emotion, then they must overact.  But it's not all their fault.  The lines the actors are given are commensurate with their abilities.  And those are just the lines I could understand- most of the time there was such an avalanche of mumbling it's a wonder the actors are speaking English.It's sad, really.  If there's any Biblical story screaming to be made into a movie, full of drama and intrigue, it's the story of Esther.  Many times those ancient stories from 5,000 years ago are hard for the modern person to relate to, instilled with the value of the novel as we are.  But Esther reads like a novel.  You really wouldn't have to change much to make it into a good movie.Thus when Michael Sajbel decided to change nearly everything, he came up with a really really bad movie that makes no sense.  For some reason stars of David appear and are the crucial denouement- at the sacrifice of the most dramatic moment in the original story.  Now there is suddenly a deep desire of everyone to return to Jerusalem, the holy city, and the bad guys actually carry swastikas!  (Or perhaps the director was trying to link up the ancient Hindu symbol with evil?)  Honestly, as horrible as the Holocaust was, is it necessary to read such historical anachronisms into the original story?  One begins to suspect an agenda to bring modern Zionist elements into the story to make it appear that such elements have always been the part of the Jewish history, to support that particular cause.Evidently viewers aren't sophisticated enough to handle the culture and values of the people in the original story, so we have two new love stories added in.  Since we don't want to hear about Jews killing tens of thousands of their enemies, that's left out of the script, though present in the original story.  Since we can't relate to a Middle Eastern woman, Esther suddenly has the feminist sensibilities of a modern Western woman.  Since the idea of a king bedding numerous concubines in order to choose a wife is unpalatable, the script goes out of it's way to show that King Xerxes is faithful.  Of course to do this, they have to come up with arguments between Esther and Xerxes that are so convoluted and unreal that they are worthy of a sitcom, but certainly not real life.The movie isn't even internally consistent.  The original Israeli slaughter of the Ammonites (men, women, and children) is almost excused as appropriate at the beginning of the movie, in order to show the Israelis in a better light.  Yet such actions are typical of the times.  Then later the Persians blanch at the idea of killing women and children themselves, as if that were a common belief of the period.  So the earlier genocide is excused on a modern ethical level, and no attention is paid to the historically nuanced norms of the time.I'm sad I wasted two hours of my life watching this.  All the money they put into set design didn't excuse the papacity of talent that went into this film.  (And even here, when they show the actual village of Ait Benhaddou in Morocco as a great city, the CGI additions are woefully obvious.)  If you want a good story, I'd recommend you instead to the Jewish story of Esther in the Torat/Old Testament, where incidentally the Jews are the heroes.

Let me just offer a brief opinion from the perspective of a bible teacher and secular historian.First of all, this film is a cut above the typical 'Christian' attempt at Hollywood quality. The scenery of ancient Persia looks more Indian than Persian, but the computer effects are quite acceptable and remind one (remotely) of the Lord of the Rings genre. (Made no less obvious by the casting of two of the stars from those films.)Having said that, the film is not up to the quality of 'Joseph', Moses', or other such movies done on a Hollywood budget. The sound quality is not top-notch, and many lines are inaudible. The acting is better than expected, including a worthy effort by Tiffany Dupont as Esther. The King Xerxes character seemed somewhat strained and lacking at times, and Peter O'Toole makes only a brief cameo.The weakest aspect of the film is the anachronistic and too often silly reliance on the star of David theme which reduced the historical accuracy (and believability) of the movie. Also disappointing was the deflating conclusion of a story which gleans much of its suspense from the hanging of Haman. This movie deserved a much better ending.As a historian, I enjoyed the references to Greek democracy, Gilgamesh of Sumer, and the imminent downfall of King Xerxes at the hands of the Greeks. As a Christian, I appreciated what the directors attempted to do--make a modern, interesting retelling of the Esther story.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[86, 91]","Before anything else, I must say that I've read the Biblical book of Esther but NOT the book ""Haddassah"" by Tommy Tenney and Mark Andrew Olsen on which this film is based.  With that said, I'll treat this film as just another love story and not an interpretation of the Biblical story of Esther, which does vary from this film quite a bit.The story revolves around Haddassah (Tiffany Dupont), the lovely, wholesome Jewish daughter of Mordecai (the always wonderful John Rhys-Davies), a scribe for King Xerxes (Luke Goss).  Early in the film, Xerxes ""removes"" his queen from power through the meddling of Prince Admantha (John Noble) and Haman (wickedly fun James Callis), both of which have their own delusions of grandeur in mind.  Soon after, Xerxes goes on a quest to find a new queen to replace is ""removed"" one.  Women throughout all the kingdom are taken to the king's palace and treated to all the wonders and niceties one would expect from the King of Persia.  Eventually Xerxes falls for Haddassah (who's changed her name to the less Jewish-sounding Esther, for protection).  While the two are falling for each other, Admantha and Haman are both putting their own plans for taking the kingdom into motion.  One of those plans involves the destruction of all Jews in the kingdom.  With both men attempting to convince Xerxes of their own plans, Esther has to stop the destruction of her people.  If you're familiar with the Bible's version of ""Esther,"" you already know how this tale ends.Were liberties taken with the story? Yes, many in fact.  Does it destroy the story of Esther?  Absolutely not.  This is a very good film with a wonderful cast.  Unlike others, I failed to see the poor acting of the performers in this movie.  Dupont did an excellent job of portraying Esther as a kindhearted and very loving person.  John Rhys-Davies was fun as Mordecai, both proud and protective.  Callis was probably my favorite of the bunch, portraying the double-crossing and vengeful Haman with vigor.  Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister played Hegai, the Royal Eunuch in a loving manner.  I feel that he loved Esther like a sister as much as Xerxes loved her as a wife.I found no problem with the sound quality.  I understood every word very clearly.  Secondly, the visuals, especially the CGI created palace, were wonderful.  The colors in this film hearkened back to the days of the old technicolor bright, popping colors that have long faded from many memories.Overall, I highly recommend this film as a wonderful love story.  Are there better films out there that are Biblically based?  You bet.

I know it's a biblical story, but no other has touched me the way this one did. I guess a lot of people missed the point. See, in the end, it didn't  matter whether Hadassah was a jew or a gentile because The King loved her anyway despite her trying to hide it. It's about standing up for what you believe in no matter the consequences. It's about having enough courage, pride, and bravado to rise up against protocol and/or a whole nation to defend your heritage and your people no matter the cost. Hadassah could've been a coward, keep up her charade, and let all the Jews get slaughtered, but she chose to stand up even if that meant she would parrish. Courage like that no longer exists in the world today. People only want movies about drugs, sex, and violence. Don't get me wrong, that's cool too, but every now and then it's refreshing to see a movie that pushes the envelope. That makes you think, that makes you feel glad, or take pride in something other than meaningless sex and killing. Whether you know the biblical story or not this is a great love story. Frankly, it's just an awesome story all the way around. Trust me, it's very hard to keep my Husband awake to watch anything I like to watch, but he loved this movie also, and he was just as moved as I was.  It's about a very beautiful Jewish woman named Hadassah who later becomes the biblical Esther, Queen of Persia. Hadassah is snatched up and forced to become a candidate for King Xerxes who is about to take a bride. Once Hadassah is captured her father tells her it is best to conceal her identity and call herself Esther. The woman formerly known as Hadassah manages to win The King's heart by letting him know that it's not his Crown, his title, or his riches that matters most because she would rather have his heart more than any of those things. This jesture touches The King and he takes her to be his bride falling deeply in love with her. Hadassah (Esther) is then married into wealth and privledge meanwhile she's hiding who she really is from The King. Of course, there's always greed stricken people that wanna overthrow The King for their own selfish purposes. At any rate, to prevent from revealing every single detail which would spoil the whole entire movie, and to cut this short. The King is about to leave and appoint the wrong person as his successor because he has only on thing on the brain..eradicating all the Jews! At this point Hadassah has a decision to make. She could forget who she is and let her people suffer the consequences, or she could expose herself to The King and beg for her life, her father's life, and the life of her people. Showing great courage and bravery she decides to stand and let her true identity be known. Of course, there's now a choice to be made..Does The King let her live? or Does The King let her die? or Does he love he enough not to care who or what she is?

Esther, a heroine for Jews and Christians alike, is a Biblical queen who hid her faith until she had to reveal it to save her people. Her story, which inspired the Jewish holiday of Purim, is a consummate tale of love conquering religious hatred, and the corruption behind the scenes of a good man in power.There was not enough budget and certainly not enough directorial skill to make this film laudable.  The film's production values were undermined by the workmanship of the cameras, the lighting, the editing, and the dubious choices made by the director. All told, the effort was less than professional. Murky flashbacks and some stilted dialogue were amateurish; sound quality was poor. There are some heartbreakingly beautiful scenes and costumes in the movie, filmed in India, which was sitting on the shelf since March of 2005.  Director Michael Sajbel should not be placed at the helm of a film again.In the theater where I saw the movie, there were cheers at the end of the film. No doubt they were from those who were glad to see a Biblical tale brought out as a first run film, without the evils of Hollywood in the way. I understand the sentiment, but fail to understand how many of the viewers could ignore the plainly painful attempts at making this film.

It's hard to review a movie like this because so many personal feelings and convictions come into play.  Yes, the movie does have a lot of differences from scripture but its a movie.  That's what movies do.  They take artistic license which sometimes is necessary for a film to move at a certain pace or to allow the film to move smoothly from one scene to the next.  Remember the Ten Commandments?  A lot of that movie was not scriptural but it is still considered one of the greatest and most loved films of all time.I agree with one reviewer who noted that the sound editing was less than perfect.  It should have been better and some of the dialog was lost because of that.  The exterior location shots were beautiful.  Costuming was also excellent even if there was more of an Indian influence rather than a Persian one.There's one thing that a good film does that's worth all the tea in London. That is to make you curious enough to read the source material.  That's what this film did for me as I haven't read the Book of Esther in quite awhile.  When you return to the source material you can then clear up all of the inconsistencies that you found in the film and then some.I hope that people will view and buy this film so that Hollywood gets the message that they are some folks who are tired of the naked sex, violent, drug ridden, foul mouthed movies that they constantly churn out from year to year.

1027144,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B000JJSJO6,Newton Ooi,"[3, 9]","At the beginning of this film before the opening credits is a brief advertisement stating that this film is part of Fox Christian Network; i.e. this film was made by Christians to convey a Christian message.  The film then begins with a flashback to the past and the origins of a blood feud between the Jews and the Agagites.  The movie then fast forwards to Hadassah living with her aunt and uncle outside of Susa in Persia.  They are part of the Jewish minority in the Persian empire.  All is not well inside the walls of Susa.  King Xerxes of Persia is young and does not command the respect of all his princes and ministers.  Many of the latter want war with the Greeks, some for glory, some for riches, and others to get the King out of Persia thereby opening the way for a new leader.  They know the King's wife is against war, and several princes scheme to get rid of her, which they accomplish.  King Xerxes must then take a new wife, and he chooses Hadassah.  In her position, she becomes aware of schemes to kill the King and the Jews, and she in turn schemes to turn these back, while keeping the love of the King, who she truly loves as a husband.  The movie finishes with her triumphant, her uncle, Mordecai, taking an important post in the empire, and the Jew's enemy, Haman, hung.The plot is based on the Bible, and is portrayed very well; one of the better screenplay adaptations from the Bible this decade.  The cinematography is also excellent; both the architecture of Susa and the visual shots remind me of the city of Gondor from the LOTR movies.  The soundtrack is average, and is often unnoticeable, which is unfortunate as a Biblical epic such as this should have great music to go along with it.  The biggest failing was the casting; nearly all the characters were either American, English or Indian.  Most of the actors and actresses were either too light skinned (American or English) or too dark skinned (Indian).  This is unfortunate and unnecessary as there is a fairly large number of professional actors and actresses from Iran, Turkey, Israel and other Middle East countries that could have been casted here.  Even worse is that many of the accents clearly sound 21st century American.  I did not expect this movie to follow Gibson's Passion of the Christ and be filmed in Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic.  But I did expect the characters to converse in sentences more reminiscent of the Bible than of a modern school-play.Another minus of this film is that the dialogue often discusses the themes of democracy versus monarchy, and how the Persians always swear by monarchy and are opposed to democracy, which is what their enemies, the Greeks, practice.  Seeing that this movie came out in 2006, I somehow suspect that members of the Bush administration or the US Republican Party leaned on Fox (fair and balanced) to produce a movie deploring Iran (modern-day Persia) and upholding Western society (Greeks and Jews).  This inclusion of democracy vs monarchy in the dialogue made it seem fake; the very concept of democracy would not have entered the minds of the Persian empire as Greek was an aristocracy; only land-holding males had a say in government.Still, with all of its failings, the movie made for good entertainment, but not worth watching more than once.",3,Entertainment or propaganda,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,3294,"['beginning', 'film', 'opening', 'credits', 'brief', 'advertisement', 'stating', 'film', 'part', 'Fox', 'Christian', 'Network', 'i.e', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Christians', 'convey', 'Christian', 'message', 'film', 'then', 'flashback', 'past', 'origins', 'blood', 'feud', 'Jews', 'Agagites', 'movie', 'then', 'fast', 'forwards', 'Hadassah', 'living', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'outside', 'Susa', 'Persia', 'are', 'part', 'Jewish', 'minority', 'Persian', 'empire', 'not', 'well', 'walls', 'Susa', 'King', 'Xerxes', 'Persia', 'young', 'not', 'command', 'respect', 'princes', 'ministers', 'Many', 'latter', 'want', 'war', 'Greeks', 'glory', 'riches', 'others', 'get', 'King', 'Persia', 'thereby', 'opening', 'way', 'new', 'leader', 'know', 'King', 'wife', 'war', 'several', 'princes', 'scheme', 'get', 'rid', 'accomplish', 'King', 'Xerxes', 'must', 'then', 'take', 'new', 'wife', 'Hadassah', 'position', 'aware', 'schemes', 'kill', 'King', 'Jews', 'turn', 'schemes', 'turn', 'back', 'keeping', 'love', 'King', 'who', 'truly', 'husband', 'movie', 'triumphant', 'uncle', 'Mordecai', 'taking', 'important', 'post', 'empire', 'Jew', 'enemy', 'Haman', 'hung.The', 'plot', 'based', 'Bible', 'portrayed', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'better', 'screenplay', 'adaptations', 'Bible', 'decade', 'cinematography', 'also', 'excellent', 'architecture', 'Susa', 'visual', 'shots', 'city', 'Gondor', 'LOTR', 'movies', 'soundtrack', 'average', 'often', 'unnoticeable', 'unfortunate', 'Biblical', 'epic', 'such', 'should', 'have', 'great', 'music', 'go', 'along', 'biggest', 'failing', 'was', 'casting', 'nearly', 'characters', 'were', 'either', 'American', 'English', 'Indian', 'Most', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'either', 'too', 'light', 'skinned', 'American', 'English', 'too', 'dark', 'skinned', 'Indian', 'unfortunate', 'unnecessary', 'fairly', 'large', 'number', 'professional', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Iran', 'Turkey', 'Israel', 'other', 'Middle', 'East', 'countries', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'casted', 'here', 'Even', 'worse', 'many', 'accents', 'clearly', 'sound', '21st', 'century', 'American', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'movie', 'follow', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'be', 'filmed', 'Latin', 'Hebrew', 'Aramaic', 'did', 'expect', 'characters', 'converse', 'sentences', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'Bible', 'modern', 'school-play.Another', 'minus', 'film', 'dialogue', 'often', 'themes', 'democracy', 'versus', 'monarchy', 'how', 'Persians', 'always', 'swear', 'monarchy', 'are', 'opposed', 'democracy', 'what', 'enemies', 'Greeks', 'practice', 'Seeing', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '2006', 'somehow', 'suspect', 'members', 'Bush', 'administration', 'US', 'Republican', 'Party', 'leaned', 'Fox', 'fair', 'balanced', 'produce', 'movie', 'deploring', 'Iran', 'modern-day', 'Persia', 'upholding', 'Western', 'society', 'Greeks', 'Jews', 'inclusion', 'democracy', 'vs', 'monarchy', 'dialogue', 'made', 'seem', 'fake', 'very', 'concept', 'democracy', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'entered', 'minds', 'Persian', 'empire', 'Greek', 'was', 'aristocracy', 'only', 'land-holding', 'males', 'had', 'say', 'government.Still', 'failings', 'movie', 'made', 'good', 'entertainment', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once']",One Night with the King
1027145,A1J0D7V1DKE80W,B000JJSJO6,"Nicole La Rochelle ""Sharki Raqs""","[2, 5]","What a great movie!! There are so many reasons I enjoyed this film. Ironically I never heard about it at all until I purchased the DVD at a yard sale for only $2 !  I have watched it countless times since and it's like the movie that ""keeps on going"". One of the reasons I liked it so much is because it inspired me to get back into digging up history so to speak. I think far too often folks take information at face value or hastily gloss over information which, if researched can actually be the beginning of an exciting adventure!I liked all the characters in the movie except the man who played the kings cousin. His fake hair just annoyed me everytime I looked at it, and the man who played Haman's constant grating voice was a little too much. I agree with some of the reviewers in the colum who said the sound quality wasn't the best: I had to watch the movie several times to actually catch everything that was being said, but that's ok as it was worth it. Another irony, you can hear Esther and Xerxes kissing just fine!Interesting things: it made me realize just how powerful kings might have been in times past, how much women were treated as ""less than"" (I am so glad I am a female in the U.S. in this day in age!!) and just how stupid idol/demon worship is. It also made me realize just how different people really are, and how the ""powers that be"" keep trying to make this ""one world"" thing happen, well it's just not gonna happen. History repeats itself and everything old is new again. I see people looking to their spiritual past to see their spiritual future.The other comments in the column about how the scenery was more Indian than Persian, well, as far as I am aware, there's not much left of ancient Persian buildings, but since Indian building seem to be timeless, and since Xerxes ruled from ""India to Ethiopia"", then why not? Makes sense to me. There's not that much distance between the middle east and the far east these days. It was nice to see people of several different ethinicities in the film as Xerxes' kingdom was so diverse I think that was well represented. It was kind of funny to have three of the main stars be folks of European descent. I was glad to see Omar Shariff as his acting is always superb. I didn't like the fact that Peter O'Toole made a super-brief cameo in the film, yet got top billing. What about John Rhys Davies who's played some great roles and has a large part in this film and his name isn't mentioned until after the title, almost unsceen? That was dissappointing.It took some research to find out that Xerxes and Ahaseurus are the same person. Why he has two names I do not know, but in my Bible, he's called Ahaseurus. I appreciate the fact that this film was made. I'd really like to see more movies made that are based on historical fact and not all ""Hollywoodized"". People around the world are becoming more in touch with their roots and I feel more films like this one will cause people to ""dig deeper"". I think the love story part was a bit Hollywoodized as in reality I've read Esther ""pleased"" him above all the others and that cane be taken in several ways!! I'm going to try to think along the good line of God gave her favor in his eyes and not think about what Xerxes might have been thinking about.

1027148,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B000JJSJO6,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[3, 4]","Lights!  Camera!  Weird costuming?  Sadly, yes.  The worst part of this movie is the weirdest justaposition of costuming I have ever seen in any movie!  King Ahasures wears clothing -- and crowns -- more suitable for King Arthur!  His evil cousin looks like someone dressed straight out of the court of Louis XIV!  Esther-Hadassah, and the other aspirants for queenhood, are dressed in clothing that could easily be mistaken for 19th century party dresses.  And Queen Vashti, is dressed in one scene in a dress that could have come from the court of Louis XVI, (without a petticoat), and in another, with a head-gear that could easily have been from Outer Space -- or somewhere. A little research on the part of the costume designer could have gone a long way in making this film look, and feel, more realistic!  (More on the bad costuming to come.....)The best part of this film?  The Music!  Melodic without getting maudlin, the music echos the best ""movie spectacular"" music of past.  The themes sounded timeless....most could have been used in any spectacle film.  There is just a tiny touch of what we have come to expect as ""ancient Hebraic""....but it is generalized, far more, into the genre of ""general grand movie heroic"" ....which is good -- because I, for one, find myself exteremely embarrassed at the maudlin tone too-often given ""Jewish"" music offered in most films.  Thankfully -- and beautifully -- a ""grand movie heroic"" score more than sufficed here.This movie, indeed, tries hard to be good, in all departments.  You can tell that everyone involvedin it was very dedicated to bringing The Bible's Book of Esther to life.Tiffany Dupont was truly excellent and very, very believable as thegirl-into-woman queen, and, as Xerxes, Luke Goss was almost as credible.Omar Sharif, as always, was truly a standout, in believability of character, and acting.  Unfortunately, (as always), John Ryhs-Daviscomes across as trying just a bit too hard, (except in the very beginning scenes when Ms. Dupont -- as Hadassah -- dances around their modesthome, and Mr. Rhys-Davis, it seemed, could not help but be caught up inthe believabilty of the moment she has created.  Mr. Rhys-Davis is a fineactor -- if only he didn't try so hard, which leads to over-acting, if only just slightly.  Relax, please Mr. Rhys-Davis -- just pretend you arethe character and don't try so hard.  You don't have to try that hard....your very considerable screen presence does that for you; just relax, and ""go with the flow"", as they say.Peter O'Toole, at the beginning, in an important cameo part, also over-acts a bit.  But his part, though prominent, is too miniscule to notice the over-acting very much.The script was more at fault in the unbelievability of the story than any of the actors, however.  Firstly, we are treated to the ludicrous idea Hadassah's Uncle Mordechai is finally allowing his neice to travel, on her own, back to Judea, as is now permitted Jews of the Persian Empire to finally do.  Jews -- yes.  Young girls -- NO!  We'ere still in Biblical times, here, don't forget!  Young women were VERY closely guarded -- especially one so beloved by her uncle as Haddassah!  She is NOT a 20th or 21sr century woman, don't forget!  Hadassah appears to be about 17 when the movie begins -- and for a well-brought-up, 17-year-old girl to be given permission by her uncle/guardian to trapse, (all by herself!) to Jerusalem from Shushan, is about as believable as that same Uncle/Guardian to ask her to become a ""loose woman""!  Because, in those days, it could easily have evolved into the very same thing!  It's true that, a little LATER on in the film, her could-be boyfriend, Jessie, did offer to go with her.....but this was totally of his OWN idea, and was not, (incredibly), even mentioned by Mordechai!  (We're NOT talking about a 20th or 21st-century career girl here.  Yes, Mordechai taught Hadassah to read -- unusual enough.  But....going to Jerusalem....alone?????  NICE girls just didn't do that.....Then!It was also truly heart-breaking, just a little later on, to see Hadassah's beginning-to-be-boyfriend, (at the start of the movie), turnedforcibly into a palace servant....and more.....  He starts out as avery handsome guy, with an, (OK, slightly incongruous), fine head of very blonde hair, a mischievous, carefree manner, and colorful clothes...and winds up with a scarf on his head, hiding his hair, (or is that a new, forced baldness), wearing olive-drab palace servant garb.  He and Hadassahhad wanted to go to live in Jerusalem... But on the day, (with Hadassah'sUncle Mordechai's consent), they were about to do this.....Hadassah iscaptured to be a candidate in the new-queen contest, while poor Jesse is also captured....and more of him is taken off than his hair!  I don't know....but it really seemed to me that before this, Haddassah and Jesse were beginning to fall in love....and then this queen-thing had to happen.  If I had been Haddassah-Esther, I would have found it VERY difficult indeed to fall in love with a king....no matter how kind or how handsome....if his orders had completely ruined the life, (and manhood), of the boy I was beginning to like....  Jesse does wind up as the Queen's ally, which is nice to see.  But -- to make the story more believable, and Xerxes' and Esther's love more real -- I would have eliminated the character of Jesse altogether.  Or make him fall in love with, or be promised to, someone else.  As it is, having the movie turn Jessie into an unwilling servant makes Esther -- even with all the believabilty Tiffany Dupont puts into the character -- seem awfully fickle.....Persian men -- especially Persian rulers -- mostly wore beards.  LONG, artificially curling beards.  Today's audience, however, usually does not find long, curling beards on men as attractive.  I was wondering how this situation would be handled.  Well, it was handled giving Xerxes a mustache, and just a small beard.  OK --- but they weren't curling, after the manner of the real Ancient Persians.  This -- plus his long straight hair, and pointed crown, made him look more like King Arthur than Xerxes!SOMETHING more should have been done!I noticed that Haman's amulet, the Aggite symbol, resembled a swastika insome respects.  I don't know if this was accurate, but it speaks volumes to a modern audience.  However, although known as Aggites, Haman's ancestral people are better known as the AMALIKITES.  Both ancestral names could have been used...but in this movie, only the word ""Aggite"" described this ethnic group.  And -- in the Bible, at least in the Jewish versions -- Xerxes is known as ""Ahasures"".  Surely -- at least at the beginning of the movie, within the Hebrew quarter of the city -- he should have been referred to, at least once, as ""Ahasures"".  But no, the king is always called ""Xerxes"", (his Greek name!), throughout the movie.And the capital city of the Persian Empire was always ""Shushan"", as far as I know.  Here, for some unfathonable reason, it is always ""Suzhan"".Not as big a blunder, in my estimation, as the costuming-from-King-Arthur's-day-masquerading as Biblical garb, or the non-curling, even a little, of King Ahasure's (who????) beard....but still adding to the non-believability of the action on-screen.The King's evil cousin wears a hairstyle that would be at home in the court of Louis XIII.  Vashti's clothes seem right out of the court of Louis XV....and her hairstyle, in one crucial scene, seems from outer-space, or somewhere.  These multi-century costumes had me thinking of the fantasy TV series, ""Dinotopia"", where people from many centuries come together, co-existing with each other and with dinosaurs.  Not a bad show -- but should NOT be something one is reminded of, via costuming, watching a movie version of The Book of Esther!  A real no-no, that could SO easily have been prevented by a little historical costume research.  (Strangely, Omar Shariff's costumes...although perhaps not 100% authentic...did NOT look out of place at all.  Dark and/or flowing, theytook one immediately to Ancient Persia, especially when he was bareheaded, and did not have to wear the only slightly incongruous headgear given him.  As for most of the other costumes....a real mix-up, or, as the Yiddish expression goes, ""Kasha & Borsht""  (don't mix!)The towering scenery takes one's breath away.  However, I'm not sure it is accurate.  I DO know, however, that the SEWING of cloth into clothingdid not take place until about the 1400s.  Before then, people mostly draped their garments.  Too many costumes in this Biblical epic came across as looking as if they were from the 14th century....A.D, NOT B.C!The diadems of the Biblical periods I have seen are mainly ciclets, some gold, and some with jewels....but NOT with points!  Xerxes looked too much like King Arthur in too many scenes!  And Esther-Hadassah's dresses looked far too much like party-dressees from the 1890s, instead of the draped robes people wore in biblical times!  This mis-juxtapositioning of clothing styles takes a LOT away from the believabilty of the movie!The script was creditable in most scenes.  But in other scenes, credulity was strained by stilted dialogue.  And embarrassing dialogue. The last scene, wherein Mordechai, newly made a minister-advisor to the King, decribes himself as, ""I, Mordechai, Prince of Persia....a Jew"", is truly embarrassing to those who, like myself, were taught in Hebrew School that Jews are no better, and no worse than anyone else, and that the only reason Jews are called ""The Chosen People"" is because they were chosen to help God give the world The Ten Commandments.  But that happened 5,000 years ago....and today, every Human Being is pretty much the same, with only God above everyone!  (One God = everyone is equal -- get it????)It was nice, however, to see Haman lump together the ""democracy"" ideal of the Greeks, (the enemy of the Persians), with the ""one God"" idea of the Jews, (who were the enemy of Haman).  If the villian of a film puts two groups together as his enemies, then they are, per force, both good-guygroups, and have a lot in common!  As in Tiffany Dupont's delightful and realistic portrayal of, not just a Jewish girl....but a Human one....this putting together of ""Jews"" and ""Greeks"" -- even by Haman, the bad guy, should help to bring ALL people together, as good guys....and for all of us ""good guys"" to see more similarity than differences in each other.This movie is a LOT better than the truly awful 1961 epic, Esther And The King, which is full of hackneyed dialogue, and which actually OMITS the climactic scene wherein Queen Esther, risking her life for her peoples', enters the King's throne-room unannounced.  Mordechai, melodramatically, appears in chains in once scene in ""Esther and The King"", and, although the stars in that 1961 movie, (Joan Collins and Richard Eagan), try real hard, nothing could save it, with that hackneyed dialogue and script.  ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING is certainly an improvement.....but the BEST version I have read of this story, (and there are many book versions), isGladys Malvern's true classic ""BEHOLD YOUR QUEEN"", (also reveiewed by mefor Amazon.)  Now, THAT book would make the PERFECT ""Purim"" movie....and I do hope someone buys the rights to it soon, and makes a movie of it.In the meantime, despite it's many flaws and inadequacies, ""One Night With The King"", seems to be the best ""Purim"" movie we have, at least so far....P.S.  I'm looking forward to seeing other movies with TIFFANY DUPONT them!If there is one spark of true vitality, and even more important, truebelievability in ""One Night With The King"".....Ms. DuPont is it!!!!!",3,S T I L L......A......B I T......D I S A P P O I N T E D..........,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,11701,"['Lights', 'Camera', 'Weird', 'costuming', 'Sadly', 'yes', 'worst', 'part', 'movie',

It's got all the elements of a story to be eaten: romance, intrigue, action, and even a little comedy.""One Night with the King"" is actually based on a novel, based on the biblical account. As such, it's already a little skewed from the start. Some of the changes are acceptable, like Esther's childhood sweetheart following her into the palace (though I thought eunuchs were made at early childhood, not near adulthood.)Other changes weren't so palatable. King Xerxes is portrayed in a far more sympathetic light than the real man deserved. Queen Vashti's defiance is not known for certain, but it wasn't an anti-war protest. Haman's relationship was portrayed as antagonistic to Esther, but the biblical account implies he was more than pleased to be the guest of honor at her parties.The history is tied in all right. Xerxes's motivation was to conqueor Greece, and it was good to portray Haman making false charges of allying the Jews and the Greeks together. Of course, it's the Greeks who eventually bring down the Persians.The acting overall is pretty good. Omar Sharif and John Rhys-Davis, of course, are always great, and I see good things ahead for Tiffany Dupont. And I've always liked Tom Lister Jr. (he's got the look of a man who'd be nice to the girls, but break a leg for the king.)The worst elements, however, are the direction, which got clunky and choppy, especially toward the end. Lay off the dramatic drums, please, especially when changing camera angles.

The overall acting was only mediocre. Esther in real life was not a giddy, happy-go-lucky free spirit but a serious and mature young woman. The depiction of Mordecai was even more ridiculous. Instead of showing him as an active, important advisor to King Ahasuerus, he is portrayed as an outsider. The same goes for Haman who is incorrectly portrayed as an instigator stirring up the masses against the Jews instead of doing it quietly and deceitfully behind the scenes.The 1999 film ""Esther"" is light years ahead of this film in every aspect, especially biblical and historical accuracy. Plus, the acting is superb. It is so sad when film makers can't product an accurate rendition of a biblical story.

1027156,AU1E6KDG1FMG6,B000JJSJO6,Rebekah A. Lane,"[2, 4]","I've always thought the book of Esther would make a great basis for a movie, and I throughally enjoyed watching this inspiring, touching story of a crisis between love and faith. The filming blew me away, it is so beautifully done, and all the actors filled their parts well. I liked the Bible quotations. They found places in the story very naturally -- not as though they were ""sprinkled in"" to make it Christian. Giving the head-eunich a mojor role was a good move: I've often thought when reading the book of Esther, ""If they were going to make a movie, something could really be done with this character."" Esther is potrayed as cheerful and lighthearted through the first part of the movie, and perhaps a bit too giddy as some reviewers have pointed out, but this serves as a good contrast to how her faith deepens as the grave responsibilities of her position settle down on her. Mordiciah narrarates the story, but, dissapointingly, is given a somewhat minor role otherwise. The soundtrack is flawlessly clear -- lots of rich, ethnical sounding music and pounding drums. This movie isn't for everyone, though, and there are parts of it I think could have been done better myself. It should be understood that this is not a dramitization of the Book of Esther, but rather someone's artistic idealization of it. The plot differs from the bibical account in many places, and when it does, it sometimes just makes the story harder to believe. There are also some historical diviations. According to the customs of that time, the queen was always veiled in mixed company, but we can't very well hide Tiffany Duponts lovely face through half of the show, now can we? And if I understand the bibical way of putting it, ""in the evening she shall go in, and in the morning she shall come out,"" those girls that went to see the King *spent the night* with him. That is a really delicate thing to depict in film modestly -- just don't sit down with this movie thinking this is all according to the Bible and the way they did things back then. Read Esther, and enjoy watching this if you aren't a stickler for word for word realism.

Why use the Bible if you won't follow it?I have no problem adding details and making up details to fill in the missing part of the biblical narrative.  I do have a problem fabricating completely erroneous items and then leaving out facts from the story itself.The details added about the escaped Queen of Agag in order to explain Haman's association with King Agag and the Amalekites made me uncomfortable.  It seemed to go too far and implied that the biblical account in I Samuel 15 is lacking.The mystical ""Star of David"" jewel was way overboard and puts the whole story in the realm of fantasy instead of historical fact.  This is probably by far the most bothersome thing about the film.Haman was thrilled and honored to be invited to the private banquet with Esther and the King, not fighting against it as the movie portrays.There were TWO banquets, not one.Esther did not come before the king a la ""The Two Towers"" by bursting through the doors--what absolute silliness.  She was standing in the court and the king held out his scepter for her to approach.As has been mentioned, the acting is wooden and stilted.  The relationship between the king and Esther is hokey and completely based upon modern Western Hollywood sentimentalities.On the positive side (and this is VERY positive), violence is discreet, there is no swearing, and the physical relationships are prudently handled, meaning no nudity and ""bed"" scenes.  This story is potentially rampant with sensuality, so the producers' restraint is to be commended. Thy followed the principles of Christian morality and sensibilities, as well as the biblical injunction not to dwell on evil.The funny thing is that it is neither a good Bible version of the story nor a good love story.  If the acting and storyline had been romantic, my wife and I might overlook some of the inaccuracies.  But the acting and lines we so disjointed that combined with the lack of biblical accuracy, there just isn't much left.  In other words, bad acting but accurate story = OK; good acting and romantic storyline but so-so accuracy = OK.

Made on a budget of somewhere around $20,000,000, ""One Night With The King"" is evidence of that. This looks and feels like so much more. A story of hope and faith for both Jews and Christians, somehow it seems Hollywood just doesn't get that there is an extremely large audience just waiting for more.

It is not really bad, it's beautifully shot and entertaining, but was it necessary to tell Esther's story like this?Ambience, settings and costumes are beautiful to look at, no doubt about that. The historical / Biblical correctness of the content is disputable, including the fact that together with the ""villain"", as is well-known, thousands of his followers including their wives and children were killed and that this now is seen as a reason for rejoicing and celebrating. A fact which is of course not mentioned in this film, because its real purpose is not telling the story of Esther, but eulogizing the ""power of love"".Esther's characterization rings hollow and all too smooth to me: how many pious women and girls will now see a role model in her, a seeming proof for the idea that virtue and love can solve any problem in the world?Esther continually speaks of a test she must go through, but we see very early that she has fallen in love with the king. So, her ""test"" means a life in riches and honours by the side of the man she loves. And how did she get his attention? With a trinket she does not own, but which she knows the king likes best from all the pieces of jewellery in his treasure chamber. And how dramatic her legendary entrance before the king: not dressed as a queen the way the Bible says, but drenched in rain and barefoot she appears before him carrying her people's pledge.It is noticeable that Esther is the true head of state here, not Xerxes, and that she rules a) a weak and insecure king, b) his eunuchs, c) his concubines, whom she treats like some kind of mother hen. Of course she gets her happy ending, how else could it be for a female endowed with so much beauty, goodness and virtue.Whether this is now the right way to tell a Biblical occurrence everybody must judge for himself. As for me, the lack of realism of this film annoyed me; and in particular, I wouldn't want to know how many pious women and girls will now want to emulate this idealized female figure and become manipulating, vain domestic tyrants. Life is not a fairy tale and not everybody will be enthusiastic about looking up to your ""virtue"" and coming to you for advice about how they have to be.If you are interested in a convincing - also somehow bombastic, but at least more realistic - telling of this Biblical occurrence, try ""Esther and the King"" from 1960.",3,Oh dear...,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,2507,"['classic', 'Biblical', 'story', 'Persian', 'king', 'Xerxes', 'wife', 'Esther', 'respectively', 'Hadassah', 'told', 'kind', 'soap', 'opera', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'entertaining', 'was', 'necessary', 'tell', 'Esther', 'story', 'Ambience', 'settings', 'costumes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'look', 'doubt', 'historical', '/', 'Biblical', 'correctness', 'content', 'disputable', 'including', 'fact', 'together', 'villain', 'well-known', 'thousands', 'followers', 'including', 'wives', 'children', 'were', 'killed', 'now', 'seen', 'reason', 'rejoicing', 'celebrating', 'A', 'fact', 'course', 'not', 'mentioned', 'film', 'real', 'purpose', 'not', 'telling', 'story', 'Esther', 'eulogizing', 'power', 'love', 'characterization', 'rings', 'hollow', 'too', 'smooth', 'how', 'many', 'pious', 'women', 'girls', 'will', 'now', 'see', 'role', 'model', 'seeming', 'proof', 'idea', 'virtue', 'love', 'can', 'solve', 'problem', 'world', 'Esther', 'continually', 'test', 'must', 'go', 'see', 'very', 'early', 'fallen', 'love', 'king', 'So', 'test', 'life', 'riches', 'honours', 'side', 'man', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'attention', 'trinket', 'not', 'own', 'king', 'best', 'pieces', 'jewellery', 'treasure', 'chamber', 'how', 'dramatic', 'legendary', 'entrance', 'king', 'not', 'dressed', 'queen', 'way', 'Bible', 'drenched', 'rain', 'barefoot', 'carrying', 'people', 'pledge.It', 'noticeable', 'Esther', 'true', 'head', 'state', 'here', 'not', 'Xerxes', 'rules', 'weak', 'insecure', 'king', 'b', 'eunuchs', 'c', 'concubines', 'whom', 'kind', 'mother', 'hen', 'course', 'happy', 'ending', 'how', 'else', 'could', 'be', 'female', 'endowed', 'so', 'much', 'beauty', 'goodness', 'virtue.Whether', 'now', 'right', 'way', 'tell', 'Biblical', 'occurrence', 'everybody', 'must', 'judge', 'lack', 'realism', 'film', 'annoyed', 'particular', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'pious', 'women', 'girls', 'will', 'now', 'want', 'emulate', 'idealized', 'female', 'figure', 'become', 'manipulating', 'vain', 'domestic', 'tyrants', 'Life', 'not', 'fairy', 'tale', 'not', 'everybody', 'will', 'be', 'enthusiastic', 'looking', 'up', 'virtue', 'coming', 'advice', 'how', 'have', 'be.If', 'are', 'interested', 'convincing', 'also', 'somehow', 'bombastic', 'least', 'more', 'realistic', 'telling', 'Biblical', 'occurrence', 'try', 'Esther', 'King', '1960']",One Night with the King

It would have made a better picture book than a movie. It was cheesy, kind of like a forties bible movie; but with better costumes, sets and effects... and only slightly better acting. It was very unscriptural, with many of the changes damaging to both the characters and the overall story. Both were filled with unpractical holes. Esther in particular was played as a flighty, silly, goofy girl, who somehow still wins the heart of the king. The biblical Esther was not recorded as flighty, silly or goofy. She is portrayed as having a habit of going out alone after dark, something an unmarried girl would not have dared to do.

1027179,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000JJSJO6,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[3, 3]","I must admit that I'm a sucker for Biblical films.  It is not because I'm ultra-religious or anything like that, but I have always loved the moral dilemmas, character driven, overall uplifting stories of The Bible and appreciate any attempt to bring them to the screen.This effort is better than most as the budget is thankfully limited so the focus is on the characters with Tiffany Dupont wonderful in the lead and Omar Sharif is outstanding support and a pleasure to see on the screen even in his advanced years.  The photography is murky at times and stunning at others.  The audio portion of the DVD is problematic as we can't always make sense out of what is being said or even narrated at times.  I did not see this film in the theaters so I don't know if that is the problem originating with film itself or with the DVD transfer.  This film does come across as a ""direct to DVD"" venture or a TV-Movie, but that in of itself doesn't make this film, overall, of bad quality; I have enjoyed many such films.The story itself moves surprisingly swiftly for a 2 hour plus film.  It really doesn't feel that long and that's another reason why I enjoyed this film so much.  Amazon lists the running time at 100 minutes, but my copy was 128 minutes and it wasn't listed as an ""extended version"" or ""director's cut.""  Well, time issues aside, any story focusing on a female heroine is a nice diversion from Hollywood's obssession with men leads.  In addition, the focus on character and moral dilemmas and not Biblical spectacle is another plus for this flim.This is not necessarily ""family entertainment"" as children (pre-teens) are apt to find it boring, but if you can get the whole family to sit down and watch this and stop and talk about what is going on periodically, then it's liable to be more interesting for the younger audience.  In my household we almost never watch a film in silence.  I typically hold the remote (for pause purposes) so that we discuss what we are watching.I highly recommend this film and caution others reading these reviews to not get caught up in the reactionary rhetoric of this film being ""anti-Christian"" somehow, which it is not, or blasphemic for misinterpreting the Biblical story of Esther, which I don't feel it does, or the silly exaggerated comments that anyone not liking this film should hang there head in shame as this movie may not appeal to all and it does have some substantial flaws.  Afterall, we are reviewing a film and not The Bible itself.  I've seen some terrible versions on the life of Jesus.  Does that make me anti-Christian?  I think not.Enjoying a film is a personal thing.  Not liking a Biblical story on screen doesn't make someone anti-God and because some creative license is taken when trying to translate an ancient Biblical story to the modern screen doesn't make the film blasphemic by any means.  The heart of this story lies in the heart of Esther herself and that is faithfully adapted in this film.",4,A Nicely Told Tale,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,2974,"['must', 'admit', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'Biblical', 'films', 'not', ""'m"", 'ultra-religious', 'anything', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'character', 'driven', 'overall', 'uplifting', 'stories', 'Bible', 'appreciate', 'attempt', 'bring', 'screen.This', 'effort', 'better', 'most', 'budget', 'thankfully', 'limited', 'so', 'focus', 'characters', 'Tiffany', 'Dupont', 'wonderful', 'lead', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'outstanding', 'support', 'pleasure', 'see', 'screen', 'even', 'advanced', 'years', 'photography', 'murky', 'times', 'stunning', 'others', 'audio', 'portion', 'DVD', 'problematic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'even', 'narrated', 'times', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'theaters', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'problem', 'originating', 'film', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'film', 'come', 'direct', 'DVD', 'venture', 'TV-Movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'overall', 'bad', 'quality', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'such', 'films.The', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'swiftly', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'feel', 'long', 'reason', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'Amazon', 'running', 'time', '100', 'minutes', 'copy', 'was', '128', 'minutes', 'was', ""n't"", 'listed', 'extended', 'version', 'director', 'cut', 'Well', 'time', 'issues', 'aside', 'story', 'focusing', 'female', 'heroine', 'nice', 'diversion', 'Hollywood', 'obssession', 'men', 'leads', 'addition', 'focus', 'character', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'not', 'Biblical', 'spectacle', 'plus', 'flim.This', 'not', 'necessarily', 'family', 'entertainment', 'children', 'pre-teens', 'are', 'apt', 'find', 'boring', 'can', 'get', 'whole', 'family', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'stop', 'talk', 'what', 'going', 'periodically', 'then', 'liable', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'younger', 'audience', 'household', 'almost', 'never', 'watch', 'film', 'silence', 'typically', 'hold', 'remote', 'pause', 'purposes', 'so', 'discuss', 'what', 'are', 'watching.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'caution', 'others', 'reading', 'reviews', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'reactionary', 'rhetoric', 'film', 'being', 'anti-Christian', 'somehow', 'not', 'blasphemic', 'misinterpreting', 'Biblical', 'story', 'Esther', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'silly', 'exaggerated', 'comments', 'anyone', 'not', 'liking', 'film', 'should', 'hang', 'head', 'shame', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'have', 'substantial', 'flaws', 'Afterall', 'are', 'reviewing', 'film', 'not', 'Bible', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'terrible', 'versions', 'life', 'Jesus', 'make', 'anti-Christian', 'think', 'not.Enjoying', 'film', 'personal', 'thing', 'Not', 'liking', 'Biblical', 'story', 'screen', ""n't"", 'make', 'someone', 'anti-God', 'creative', 'license', 'taken', 'when', 'trying', 'translate', 'ancient', 'Biblical', 'story', 'modern', 'screen', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'blasphemic', 'means', 'heart', 'story', 'heart', 'Esther', 'faithfully', 'adapted', 'film']",One Night with the King

The same source also reads that the earliest record of the use of the star is found in the 3-4th century AD (CE,  blah blah), on the arch of an ancient synagogue found in Galilee.  So this entire movie is based on a gimmick that isn't really accurate.  It makes it look like the king got mad at Haman simply because of seeing a bunch of stars float around during a banquet,  instead of realizing that his trusted advisor had planned to wipe out an entire nation for no good reason.The Biblical story of Esther is so exciting and so complete that it doesn't need the silly additions found in this movie.  Had someone used the Old Testament as the sole source of research,  there would have been plenty to make a decent movie.I also had a problem with the Jewish males being rounded up and made into eunuchs while the females were being rounded up as beauty pageant contestants.  Hadassah's friend Jesse wouldn't have been so eager to run off to Jerusalem after being castrated,  as Biblical law forbids the entrance into the temple of any Jewish man who has been ""injured in his stones.""  I have read in one historical account that conquering countries had a problem when turning Jewish men into eunuchs,  as they would often commit suicide when castrated rather than lose their right to worship as a Jewish man.  This account said that often a man who was seen to be Jewish would be left intact or killed outright,  rather than castrated,  as it would often result in the suicide of an otherwise valuable slave.  I'm not sure if that is accurate,  but this movie could have left out the whole Jesse plot,  since he looked like a boy band member anyway.Read the Biblical account of Esther,  and you'll find a powerful story that stays with you longer than this rather silly movie,  although I do appreciate any film made that acknowledges that many people still have faith in this day and age.",2,The book is better-and I don't mean the novelized version this movie is based on,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,2305,"['did', ""n't"", 'do', 'in-depth', 'study', 'when', 'Star', 'David', 'started', 'showing', 'up', 'Jewish', 'symbol', 'quick', 'trip', 'Wikipedia', 'writing', 'review', 'turned', 'up', 'information', 'archeological', 'proof', 'exists', 'use', 'Star', 'David', 'Kingdom', 'Israel', 'BCE', 'years', 'BC', 'who', 'were', 'school', 'everyone', 'got', 'so', 'squeamish', 'use', 'anything', 'smacks', 'religion', 'same', 'source', 'also', 'earliest', 'record', 'use', 'star', 'found', '3-4th', 'century', 'AD', 'CE', 'blah', 'blah', 'arch', 'ancient', 'synagogue', 'found', 'Galilee', 'So', 'entire', 'movie', 'based', 'gimmick', ""n't"", 'really', 'accurate', 'look', 'king', 'got', 'mad', 'Haman', 'simply', 'seeing', 'bunch', 'stars', 'float', 'around', 'banquet', 'instead', 'realizing', 'trusted', 'advisor', 'had', 'planned', 'wipe', 'out', 'entire', 'nation', 'good', 'reason.The', 'Biblical', 'story', 'Esther', 'so', 'exciting', 'so', 'complete', ""n't"", 'need', 'silly', 'additions', 'found', 'movie', 'Had', 'someone', 'used', 'Old', 'Testament', 'sole', 'source', 'research', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'make', 'decent', 'movie.I', 'also', 'had', 'problem', 'Jewish', 'males', 'being', 'rounded', 'up', 'made', 'eunuchs', 'females', 'were', 'being', 'rounded', 'up', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'contestants', 'Hadassah', 'friend', 'Jesse', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'eager', 'run', 'off', 'Jerusalem', 'being', 'castrated', 'Biblical', 'law', 'entrance', 'temple', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'injured', 'stones', 'have', 'read', 'one', 'historical', 'account', 'conquering', 'countries', 'had', 'problem', 'when', 'turning', 'Jewish', 'men', 'eunuchs', 'would', 'often', 'commit', 'suicide', 'when', 'castrated', 'rather', 'lose', 'right', 'worship', 'Jewish', 'man', 'account', 'said', 'often', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'seen', 'be', 'Jewish', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'intact', 'killed', 'outright', 'rather', 'castrated', 'would', 'often', 'result', 'suicide', 'otherwise', 'valuable', 'slave', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'accurate', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'whole', 'Jesse', 'plot', 'looked', 'boy', 'band', 'member', 'Biblical', 'account', 'Esther', ""'ll"", 'find', 'powerful', 'story', 'longer', 'rather', 'silly', 'movie', 'do', 'appreciate', 'film', 'made', 'many', 'people', 'still', 'have', 'faith', 'day', 'age']",One Night with the King

1027190,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000JJSJO6,Trevor Willsmer,"[7, 8]","Shot in 2003 but not released until 2006 and sporting an original title that makes it sound like a tell-all memoir by an Elvis groupie, One Night With the King is a curious beast, a lavishly produced Old Testament epic shot in India by Christian producers with a good eye for visuals, a tin ear for dialogue, a bad memory for what's actually in The Old Testament and a talent for miscasting that sees the film filled with people who either can't act or who act too much. Taking the Book of Esther as its starting point and then running as far away from it in the opposite direction as possible, it's a great story - a woman taken from her family and forced to marry a king but who finds the strength to stay his hand against her people - but you'd never know it from this retelling that seems aimed at teenage girls and the Harlequin/Mills and Boon crowd (indeed, it's adapted from a pulp romantic novel). Curiously for producers who profess their faith and damn Hollywood's dark empire, the script takes more liberties with the scripture than the studios ever did in De Mille's day, not just in an attempt to sanitise it for family viewing (no dallying with concubines or executing former wives for not turning up at feasts here) but with some very ill-advised attempts to string out the drama that simply ends up diminishing the characters as the script gets even more inane. Indeed, words literally fail Esther when she clumsily pleads her case to her sulky husband who has no problem with exterminating the Jews to raise some ready cash. Lucky thing she has a magic necklace to save the day...At its best the film looks like a lavish live action Disney fairytale with some surprisingly good CGi, but in the hands of the producers behind The Omega Code who served their apprenticeship at the pay-and-pray-and-beg-God-to-kill-your-critics evangelist network TBN, everything else falls flat: like most films made by people who use ""Praise Him"" as a form of punctuation, it's not very good, assuming that hitting you over the head with platitudes and homilies bearing more relation to bad 'love yourself' self-help books than scripture is a substitute for story, character and substance. Esther is so poorly written that it's beyond Tiffany Dupont's limited talents to rise above the script and find a character who could entrance a king: she's more likely to be found in Smallville or the O.C. than Persia. Certainly it seems to be aimed at teenage girls, and not terribly bright ones at that - it's not that the film is patronising, more that it seems to have been made by people who really aren't that bright themselves.The villains are beyond pantomime, with John Noble's evil plotting courtier vying with James Callis' swastika-sporting anti-Semite for the most over the top performance with such wildly overstated transparent villainy, all mock dramatic deep voices and snarling smiles, that they just have to be sending it all up - badly. Certainly Callis ends up doing what seems like a gravel-voiced sendup of Lord Flashheart from Black Adder II to increasingly laughable effect, but for the most part the film just sports the very worst kind of bad dialogue - not funny, just trite and uninteresting. The love scenes in particular seem to be constructed of non-sequiters haphazardly thrown together, with the actors often behaving in ways that bear no relation to the words coming out of their mouths.Casting is similarly awkward. Many of the minor supporting cast are simply too obviously Indian to convince as either Persians or Jews, but it's the featured players who are the biggest problem. Prominently billed Peter O'Toole's blink and you'll miss it 75-second cameo as the prophet Samuel is a striking display of inept self-disgust: you can almost hear the mantra of ""I'll kill my bloody agent when I get home"" running through his head as he stands where he's told and runs off the few lines he has as quickly and as angrily as possible so he can get away as fast as he can. Omar Sharif pulls off his rather more substantial supporting role with uninspired professionalism, which is good enough to pass for inspiration in this company, but is bizarrely dubbed by what sounds like a young American making no attempt to disguise his accent in his opening scene before reverting to his own voice. Not that he's the only one who sounds a bit odd - quite what accent Luke Goss' King was trying for is a mystery for the ages. Looking like he's been made up for an amateur production of Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he's so clearly trying his best despite being hopelessly out of his depth that you just end up feeling as sorry for him as you did for Richard Egan in Esther and the King. But the worst is reserved for Tiny Lister as the chief eunuch, who carries much of the film's 'inspiring' dialogue and delivers it like a dyslexic with poor eyesight trying to decipher a dead language from badly scribbled cue cards. Only John Rhys Davies really shines in the cast with a performance that's miraculously immune to the general inadequacy that surrounds him, like a diamond in a dunghill. If films like this had been around thousands of years ago, religion would never have got off the ground.",2,Have these people even READ the Book of Esther?,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,5221,"['Shot',

1027195,A1C80B497LCYKA,B000JJSJO6,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[12, 15]","One Night With The King is a pretty film, and a romantic film, but it is not a Christian film. The production design team has gone overboard trying to make the film appeal to girls. I can't remember the last time I saw so many flowers on screen, unless it was Doctor Zhivago. And the writer, basing his script on the novel by Mark Andrew Olsen, has gone overboard to make the story as romantic as possible, also appealing to girls. It is a romantic extravaganza.But the story of Esther, as it comes from the Bible, is not a romance. It is a political thriller, if anything. On the one hand, we have Xerxes, the young king of Persia, who needs a new wife because the previous one was disrespectful and disobedient. On the other, we have Haman, an ambitious man who, because Mordecai won't give him the respect he thinks he deserves, is driven by jealousy to destroy Mordecai and his people. And then there is Esther, the young woman caught in the middle, who comes into the king's court, ""for such a time as this."" As circumstances turn out, only she can save Mordecai and her people from Haman, and she does so by using her position as the king's new bride.While there is opportunity to glamorize court life and make marriage to the king something to daydream about, the main plot is one of genocide, equal to the Holocaust. To play that down in order to give the girls a little romance betrays the heart of the story. I don't believe Esther was the silly teenager portrayed by Tiffany Dupont. Nor do I think Xerxes was the star-struck romantic portrayed by Luke Goss. And Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, who plays Hegai, the Royal Eunuch, is just plain terrible. Why in the world would they have cast someone with a speech impediment in such an important role? Most of what he says is totally garbled.The simple, straightforward story as it comes to us from the Bible has been so altered and convoluted that it is almost unrecognizable as the story of Esther. Characters' motivations have been changed, there are key characters, like Prince Admantha, that don't even exist in the original, and the plot has been changed to a different story entirely. Most of the characters end up in the same place as the Bible story, but how they get there is totally different.What is really unforgivable is the fact that, rather than letting God be the hero of the story, the filmmakers introduce a magical pendant that produces stars of David on the wall. According to the new plot, the magic pendant is actually responsible for changing Xerxes mind, not God, because when he gives the reason to Esther, he says, ""I saw the stars."" God is not even involved in delivering His people. Even though God's name is not mentioned in the book of Esther, we all know who delivers the Jews in the end. It's not a magic pendant. That's a different religion.Why would Fox Faith change a story that has become one of the most beloved in both Jewish and Christian tradition? Why would they base it on a novel instead of the Bible account, which is so clear? Why would they spend so much money on sets and costumes, and then ignore script, directing and acting. And why would they introduce a magic pendant into the story? This film is a real mystery.Conclusion? Fox Faith has laid a big, expensive egg, and one on which they probably won't get their money back. To date, it's made less than $14 M domestically. Any more like this, and they can close down their new ""Christian"" division. Maybe they should get some real Christian filmmakers in there to show them what a Christian film is, plus some decent directors, writers and actors. Anything but what they're using now.Waitsel Smith",2,"FLOWERS, STARS AND ROMANCE - BUT VERY LITTLE TRUTH",1180656000,"06 1, 2007",2007,3649,"['One', 'Night', 'King', 'pretty', 'film', 'romantic', 'film', 'not', 'Christian', 'film', 'production', 'design', 'team', 'gone', 'overboard', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'appeal', 'girls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'so', 'many', 'flowers', 'screen', 'was', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'writer', 'basing', 'script', 'novel', 'Mark', 'Andrew', 'Olsen', 'gone', 'overboard', 'make', 'story', 'as', 'romantic', 'possible', 'also', 'appealing', 'girls', 'romantic', 'extravaganza.But', 'story', 'Esther', 'Bible', 'not', 'romance', 'political', 'thriller', 'anything', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'Xerxes', 'young', 'king', 'Persia', 'who', 'new', 'wife', 'previous', 'one', 'was', 'disrespectful', 'disobedient', 'other', 'have', 'Haman', 'ambitious', 'man', 'who', 'Mordecai', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'respect', 'driven', 'jealousy', 'destroy', 'Mordecai', 'people', 'then', 'Esther', 'young', 'woman', 'caught', 'middle', 'who', 'king', 'court', 'time', 'circumstances', 'turn', 'out', 'only', 'can', 'save', 'Mordecai', 'people', 'Haman', 'so', 'using', 'position', 'king', 'new', 'bride.While', 'opportunity', 'glamorize', 'court', 'life', 'make', 'marriage', 'king', 'something', 'daydream', 'about', 'main', 'plot', 'one', 'genocide', 'equal', 'Holocaust', 'play', 'down', 'order', 'give', 'girls', 'little', 'romance', 'heart', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Esther', 'was', 'silly', 'teenager', 'portrayed', 'Tiffany', 'Dupont', 'do', 'think', 'Xerxes', 'was', 'star-struck', 'romantic', 'portrayed', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'Tommy', ""'Tiny"", 'Lister', 'who', 'Hegai', 'Royal', 'Eunuch', 'just', 'plain', 'terrible', 'Why', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'cast', 'someone', 'speech', 'impediment', 'such', 'important', 'role', 'Most', 'what', 'totally', 'garbled.The', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'story', 'Bible', 'been', 'so', 'altered', 'convoluted', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'story', 'Esther', 'Characters', 'motivations', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'are', 'key', 'characters', 'Prince', 'Admantha', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'original', 'plot', 'been', 'changed', 'different', 'story', 'entirely', 'Most', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'place', 'Bible', 'story', 'how', 'get', 'totally', 'different.What', 'really', 'unforgivable', 'fact', 'rather', 'letting', 'God', 'be', 'hero', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'introduce', 'magical', 'pendant', 'stars', 'David', 'wall', 'According', 'new', 'plot', 'magic', 'pendant', 'actually', 'responsible', 'changing', 'Xerxes', 'mind', 'not', 'God', 'when', 'reason', 'Esther', 'saw', 'stars', 'God', 'not', 'even', 'involved', 'delivering', 'people', 'Even', 'God', 'name', 'not', 'mentioned', 'book', 'Esther', 'know', 'who', 'Jews', 'end', 'not', 'magic', 'pendant', 'different', 'religion.Why', 'would', 'Fox', 'Faith', 'change', 'story', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'Jewish', 'Christian', 'tradition', 'Why', 'would', 'base', 'novel', 'instead', 'Bible', 'account', 'so', 'clear', 'Why', 'would', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'sets', 'costumes', 'then', 'ignore', 'script', 'directing', 'acting', 'why', 'would', 'introduce', 'magic', 'pendant', 'story', 'film', 'real', 'mystery.Conclusion', 'Fox', 'Faith', 'laid', 'big', 'expensive', 'egg', 'one', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'money', 'back', 'date', 'made', 'less', '14', 'M', 'domestically', 'Any', 'more', 'can', 'close', 'down', 'new', 'Christian', 'division', 'Maybe', 'should', 'get', 'real', 'Christian', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'what', 'Christian', 'film', 'decent', 'directors', 'writers', 'actors', 'Anything', 'what', ""'re"", 'using', 'now.Waitsel', 'Smith']",One Night with the King
