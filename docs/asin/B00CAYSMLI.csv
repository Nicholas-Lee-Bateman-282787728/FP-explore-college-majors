These are actual comedians that knew it would be more entertaining to the crowd and viewers to make it a parody of fan interview sessions. The crowd was laughing constantly throughout the show. David cross and John Benjamin are great friends, they were not actually mad at eachother, why do you think they had him &#34;host&#34; the show.The writer/director was laughing his butt off throughout the interview, especially when Cross questioned him about 9/11, and Cross tore into the fan for not following his directions on how to ask a question. Brilliant comedy production, just not what people were expecting, which is why it was hilarious. If you are hoping for a PBS style interview of actors...go away.",5,"This production was a parody, I personally loved the joke.",1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,830,"['really', 'wanted', 'know', 'things', '34', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'start', 'voice', 'acting', '34', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'answered', 'are', 'actual', 'comedians', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'crowd', 'viewers', 'make', 'parody', 'fan', 'interview', 'sessions', 'crowd', 'was', 'laughing', 'constantly', 'show', 'David', 'cross', 'John', 'Benjamin', 'are', 'great', 'friends', 'were', 'not', 'actually', 'mad', 'eachother', 'why', 'do', 'think', 'had', '34', 'host', '34', 'show.The', 'writer/director', 'was', 'laughing', 'butt', 'interview', 'especially', 'when', 'Cross', 'questioned', '9/11', 'Cross', 'tore', 'fan', 'not', 'following', 'directions', 'how', 'ask', 'question', 'Brilliant', 'comedy', 'production', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'expecting', 'why', 'was', 'hilarious', 'are', 'hoping', 'PBS', 'style', 'interview', 'actors', 'go', 'away']",In the Field with Archer: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center

1645319,A33BNMY2NJJDDH,B00CAYSMLI,LisaE,"[1, 1]","Was really looking forward to this - but I have to be honest and say that I didn't even finish it. I love David Cross (who was the host/moderator) but his goofing around just got old real quick and he ended up talking more than anyone in the cast - and it wasn't even things that were relevant.  It got so bad that the voice of Archer H. Jon Benjamin left the stage and ended up in the control booth - but still didn't get to talk...at least up to the point where I quit watching. These Paley Center interviews don't last all that long, and if there is a large cast you don't get to hear as much as you'd like, but in this one you have the very talented and usually quite funny David Cross playing around too long, wasting time and directing questions to actors who are there (as a joke, but he did it several times and just wasted time.) I skipped ahead hoping it got better and ended up where a woman in the audience was asking a question of the creator of the series and David burst in telling her &#34;How dare you ask a question like that - who let you in here?&#34; It was a joke, but you could tell the woman was nervous asking it and he embarrassed her - you catch a glimpse of the man with her comforting her and she looks shaken. At that point I quit.  Would have really loved to actually HEAR from the CAST. Sad, waste of time for the cast as well.",2,So disappointed,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,1359,"['Was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'love', 'David', 'Cross', 'who', 'was', 'host/moderator', 'goofing', 'around', 'just', 'got', 'old', 'real', 'quick', 'ended', 'up', 'talking', 'more', 'anyone', 'cast', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'things', 'were', 'relevant', 'got', 'so', 'bad', 'voice', 'Archer', 'H.', 'Jon', 'Benjamin', 'left', 'stage', 'ended', 'up', 'control', 'booth', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'talk', 'least', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'quit', 'watching', 'Paley', 'Center', 'interviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'large', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hear', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'like', 'one', 'have', 'very', 'talented', 'usually', 'quite', 'funny', 'David', 'Cross', 'playing', 'around', 'too', 'long', 'wasting', 'time', 'directing', 'questions', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'joke', 'did', 'several', 'times', 'just', 'wasted', 'time', 'skipped', 'ahead', 'hoping', 'got', 'better', 'ended', 'up', 'where', 'woman', 'audience', 'was', 'asking', 'question', 'creator', 'series', 'David', 'burst', 'telling', '34', 'How', 'dare', 'ask', 'question', 'who', 'let', 'here', '34', 'was', 'joke', 'could', 'tell', 'woman', 'was', 'nervous', 'asking', 'embarrassed', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'man', 'comforting', 'shaken', 'point', 'quit', 'Would', 'have', 'really', 'loved', 'actually', 'HEAR', 'CAST', 'Sad', 'waste', 'time', 'cast', 'as', 'well']",In the Field with Archer: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center
