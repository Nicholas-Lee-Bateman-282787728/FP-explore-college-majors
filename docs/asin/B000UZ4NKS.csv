1097754,A3E6WP0P12COCA,B000UZ4NKS,"Bernard Heyward ""coolicewater""","[4, 4]","The Stylistics/Freda Payne concert is a classic just because of the age of the concert, the Stylistics and their lead singer, whom for the most part sounds as good live as he does in the studio, and Freda Payne, whom I knew had a couple of hit songs, (Band of Gold, Bring the Boys Home, etc...). She stole the Show! I didn't know of her Beauty, her voice (she can SANG)and the variety of her musical history. The sound, picture, and development of the DVD (one of Freda's songs sounded warbled/warped), and the fact that the Stylistics sang 5-6 songs & Freda 4 songs diminshes the context of this concert,but considering the date of the concert and the fact that this might be the only concert DVD of the Stylistics during their time, it's a keeper!",4,Soul Music,1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,749,"['Stylistics/Freda', 'Payne', 'concert', 'classic', 'just', 'age', 'concert', 'Stylistics', 'lead', 'singer', 'whom', 'most', 'part', 'as', 'good', 'live', 'studio', 'Freda', 'Payne', 'whom', 'knew', 'had', 'couple', 'hit', 'songs', 'Band', 'Gold', 'Bring', 'Boys', 'Home', 'etc', 'stole', 'Show', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Beauty', 'voice', 'can', 'SANG', 'variety', 'musical', 'history', 'sound', 'picture', 'development', 'DVD', 'one', 'Freda', 'songs', 'sounded', 'warbled/warped', 'fact', 'Stylistics', 'sang', '5-6', 'songs', 'Freda', '4', 'songs', 'context', 'concert', 'considering', 'date', 'concert', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Stylistics', 'time', 'keeper']",N/A

After you view this tape, you can say you have. Although I enjoy Freda Payne's music, I bought the DVD primarily for the Stylistics. The first time I watched it, I jumped through Freda's set. Bad idea.What was wrong with the Stylistics' performance? Pitch problems. Choreography that was bizarre and clunky. Racing through most of the set like the band was double-parked. Russell Thompkins Jr.'s goofy vocal improvs. Some inept camera work and editing. Still, because I became a Stylistics fan long after the original group had gone their separate ways, I wanted to see what they were like live. And I must say, this show has a certain goofy charm. For what I paid for it (9 bucks), it was worth it.On the other hand, I was blown away by Freda Payne. Like most, I knew her only from her monster hit ""Band of Gold."" Her brief set on this tape was a real eye-opener. The woman is a firecracker, just as good live as she is in the studio. Her numbers sparkle. The band is tight.So, all in all, a decent DVD if you can get it at a reasonable price. Just don't expect very much and you won't be disappointed.",2,A goofy charm...,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,1186,"['Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'show', 'where', 'opening', 'act', 'blew', 'headliners', 'stage', 'view', 'tape', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'enjoy', 'Freda', 'Payne', 'music', 'bought', 'DVD', 'primarily', 'Stylistics', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'jumped', 'Freda', 'set', 'Bad', 'was', 'wrong', 'Stylistics', 'performance', 'Pitch', 'problems', 'Choreography', 'was', 'bizarre', 'clunky', 'Racing', 'most', 'set', 'band', 'was', 'double-parked', 'Russell', 'Thompkins', 'Jr.', 'goofy', 'vocal', 'improvs', 'inept', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'Still', 'became', 'Stylistics', 'fan', 'long', 'original', 'group', 'had', 'gone', 'separate', 'ways', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'were', 'like', 'live', 'must', 'say', 'show', 'certain', 'goofy', 'charm', 'what', 'paid', '9', 'bucks', 'was', 'worth', 'it.On', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Freda', 'Payne', 'most', 'knew', 'only', 'monster', 'hit', 'Band', 'Gold', 'brief', 'set', 'tape', 'was', 'real', 'eye-opener', 'woman', 'firecracker', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'live', 'studio', 'numbers', 'sparkle', 'band', 'tight.So', 'decent', 'DVD', 'can', 'get', 'reasonable', 'price', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'very', 'much', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
