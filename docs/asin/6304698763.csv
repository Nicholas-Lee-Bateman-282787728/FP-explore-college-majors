But when I saw this dvd on sale, I couldn't pass it up for the buck.  I am not a Todd McFarland fan.  Actually I ran into his profile on the Animatrix DVD.  Oddly they didn't show any of his work, since the extras cover anime.So I guess this guy was to be compared to Peter Chung and maybe some of the other famous animators of our time.  Which to my belief was just how astonishing of a production quality the story was.  Spawn is your typical anti-hero figure.  For an american animation, it certainly has the so badly needed blood scenes, violence and realism that seems to be a void in this country.  Yes, I would compare Spawn more to Wicked City, or Demon City Shinjuku, more than Spiderman, Hulk etc..Why?  Simple, McFarland is trying to enter the comic book arena, but doesn't realize that this DVD has lots of closeness to some of the Japanese animation.  The bloody scenes, the sometime adult violence, and of course a sidesick which in himself is a servant of the devil.  I immediately saw this clown character to the funny character in Wicked City.  It's a common myth in Japanese demon culture.  I'm sure McFarland wasn't aware of that when he created this character.As for the DVD, wow 140 minutes seemed like a long time, but it was necessary to illustrate the story.  The part that really bothers me is that it's a double sided disk.  Why?  Obviously DVDs have plenty of space for one movie.  It's just a hassle to change it around during the middle of the movie.  VCDs ... are the same.I do really enjoy Spawn as a story.  Too bad it's a superhero category.  It would be nice to add other elements like more creatures and realms.  But i'm debating on the second episode.",4,story makes this dvd,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,1773,"['Well', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'most', 'part', 'enjoy', 'animations', 'when', 'saw', 'dvd', 'sale', 'could', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'buck', 'am', 'not', 'Todd', 'McFarland', 'fan', 'Actually', 'ran', 'profile', 'Animatrix', 'DVD', 'Oddly', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'work', 'extras', 'cover', 'anime.So', 'guess', 'guy', 'was', 'be', 'compared', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'maybe', 'other', 'famous', 'animators', 'time', 'Which', 'belief', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'astonishing', 'production', 'quality', 'story', 'was', 'Spawn', 'typical', 'anti-hero', 'figure', 'american', 'animation', 'certainly', 'so', 'badly', 'needed', 'blood', 'scenes', 'violence', 'realism', 'be', 'void', 'country', 'Yes', 'would', 'compare', 'Spawn', 'more', 'Wicked', 'City', 'Demon', 'City', 'Shinjuku', 'more', 'Spiderman', 'Hulk', 'etc..Why', 'Simple', 'McFarland', 'trying', 'enter', 'comic', 'book', 'arena', ""n't"", 'realize', 'DVD', 'lots', 'closeness', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'sometime', 'adult', 'violence', 'course', 'sidesick', 'servant', 'devil', 'immediately', 'saw', 'clown', 'character', 'funny', 'character', 'Wicked', 'City', 'common', 'myth', 'Japanese', 'demon', 'culture', ""'m"", 'sure', 'McFarland', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'when', 'created', 'character.As', 'DVD', 'wow', '140', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'necessary', 'illustrate', 'story', 'part', 'really', 'bothers', 'double', 'sided', 'disk', 'Why', 'Obviously', 'DVDs', 'have', 'plenty', 'space', 'one', 'movie', 'just', 'hassle', 'change', 'around', 'middle', 'movie', 'VCDs', 'are', 'same.I', 'do', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Spawn', 'story', 'Too', 'bad', 'superhero', 'category', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'add', 'other', 'elements', 'more', 'creatures', 'realms', 'i', ""'m"", 'debating', 'second', 'episode']",N/A

I did not have high hope for the animated series but I was very much surprised. The dialogue and, bizzarly enough, the acting are a hundred times as good as the film and the plot and characters are also much more intriguing.This is the first season of Spawn. And a great way for the uninitiated to get into it. There is no tedious exposition or any of that rubbish. Just a great set-up of characters and cool stories. But since this has stopped airing as of 1999 there has been no fourth season. It's a shame since the one thing I can be sure ofis that the story could have had one hell of a send-off when it finally climaxes.It's more than likely in syndication somewhere so I'd start watching this if I were you. But be prepared. The violence is quite graphic and the overall tone of the stories ranges from kiddie fiddlers to satanic demons. Needless to say, it's not a cartoon for kids.

He got sent to hell as the dark lord Malbogia gave him a chance to be back on Earth again as a hellspawn warrior. He finds himself set 5 years after his death only to discover that his skin and face is horribly disfigured but has a special suit made of necroplasm including a mask he can make to cover his hideousness and has special powers including to control his chains as he is fighting evil to save the innocence. Guided by a kind former hellspawn now immortal man named Cogliostro (Voiced by Richard Dystart) as his guardian, Al searches for the woman he loves while being taunted by a wisecracking demonic Clown who knows how he got here and what is he now. Al discovers that his best friend Terry Fitzgerald (Victor Love) is married to Wanda and has a daughter named Cyan which is a shock to him as he will find out his origin soon enough. He befriends friendly bums such as Gareb (Michael Mcshane), Bobby (Victor Love and more as he has sworn to protect his territory from unwelcomed intruders. Al's former boss Jason Wynn (John Raft Lee) is trying to cover up for the sadistic child murders of a sick killer named Billy Kincaid who is a mad ice-cream man that is the son of a respected US senator McMillian (Ronny Cox) and helping out with gangster Tony Twist (James Keane) who wants to find out what has been killing his men as Detectives Sam Burke (James Keane) and Twitch (Michael Mcshane) are out hunting for the killers of the men.An excellent first season to a groundbreaking animated series and one of the greatest animated shows of all time. Todd Mcfarlane created a very original and intriguing comic book in 1993 for Image comics and was selling like hot-cakes and became a comic icon for years spawing toys and merchandise then in 1996 they announced an animated series would be made but not as a saturday morning cartoon but a hard R-rated style adult animated series as HBO picked it up. It hit high ratings on May of 1997 including me when i was 15 as i have been a fan of Spawn since the first issue, this series blew my mind away. It's no kiddie show that's for sure as it has graphic bloody violence, some sexual situations, some nudity and language to some drug use but also adult themes of espionage, politicians and crime investigation to even solid storytelling. I love how it actually sticks to the source material and is faithful to the comics, Todd Mcfarlane being one of the producers make it worthwhile including excellent writing to Batman and Gargoyles style animation.This DVD has nice extras like storyboards, interview with Todd Mcfarlane and trailer to live-action Spawn movie including bios of the characters such as Violator for example.",5,Excellent first season to a classic animated show,1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,2830,"['Al', 'Simmons', 'voiced', 'Keith', 'David', 'was', 'soldier', 'who', 'fought', 'killed', 'country', 'wife', 'Wanda', 'wanted', 'children', 'suddenly', 'Al', 'was', 'murdered', 'got', 'sent', 'hell', 'dark', 'lord', 'Malbogia', 'gave', 'chance', 'be', 'back', 'Earth', 'again', 'hellspawn', 'warrior', 'set', '5', 'years', 'death', 'only', 'discover', 'skin', 'face', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'special', 'suit', 'made', 'necroplasm', 'including', 'mask', 'can', 'make', 'cover', 'hideousness', 'special', 'powers', 'including', 'control', 'chains', 'fighting', 'evil', 'save', 'innocence', 'Guided', 'kind', 'former', 'hellspawn', 'now', 'immortal', 'man', 'named', 'Cogliostro', 'Voiced', 'Richard', 'Dystart', 'guardian', 'Al', 'woman', 'being', 'taunted', 'wisecracking', 'demonic', 'Clown', 'who', 'how', 'got', 'here', 'what', 'now', 'Al', 'best', 'friend', 'Terry', 'Fitzgerald', 'Victor', 'Love', 'married', 'Wanda', 'daughter', 'named', 'Cyan', 'shock', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'origin', 'soon', 'enough', 'friendly', 'bums', 'such', 'Gareb', 'Michael', 'Mcshane', 'Bobby', 'Victor', 'Love', 'more', 'sworn', 'protect', 'territory', 'unwelcomed', 'intruders', 'Al', 'former', 'boss', 'Jason', 'Wynn', 'John', 'Raft', 'Lee', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'sadistic', 'child', 'murders', 'sick', 'killer', 'named', 'Billy', 'Kincaid', 'who', 'mad', 'ice-cream', 'man', 'son', 'respected', 'US', 'senator', 'McMillian', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'helping', 'out', 'gangster', 'Tony', 'Twist', 'James', 'Keane', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'been', 'killing', 'men', 'Detectives', 'Sam', 'Burke', 'James', 'Keane', 'Twitch', 'Michael', 'Mcshane', 'are', 'out', 'hunting', 'killers', 'men.An', 'excellent', 'first', 'season', 'groundbreaking', 'animated', 'series', 'one', 'greatest', 'animated', 'shows', 'time', 'Todd', 'Mcfarlane', 'created', 'very', 'original', 'intriguing', 'comic', 'book', '1993', 'Image', 'comics', 'was', 'selling', 'hot-cakes', 'became', 'comic', 'icon', 'years', 'spawing', 'toys', 'merchandise', 'then', '1996', 'announced', 'animated', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'not', 'saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'hard', 'R-rated', 'style', 'adult', 'animated', 'series', 'HBO', 'picked', 'up', 'hit', 'high', 'ratings', 'May', '1997', 'including', 'when', 'i', 'was', '15', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Spawn', 'first', 'issue', 'series', 'blew', 'mind', 'away', 'kiddie', 'show', 'sure', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'violence', 'sexual', 'situations', 'nudity', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'also', 'adult', 'themes', 'espionage', 'politicians', 'crime', 'investigation', 'even', 'solid', 'storytelling', 'love', 'how', 'actually', 'source', 'material', 'faithful', 'comics', 'Todd', 'Mcfarlane', 'being', 'one', 'producers', 'make', 'including', 'excellent', 'writing', 'Batman', 'Gargoyles', 'style', 'animation.This', 'DVD', 'nice', 'extras', 'storyboards', 'interview', 'Todd', 'Mcfarlane', 'trailer', 'live-action', 'Spawn', 'movie', 'including', 'bios', 'characters', 'such', 'Violator', 'example']",N/A

Al Simmons, once a federal agent with a talent for wetwork, is killed, goes to hell, and is offered a deal.  If he is willing to become a general in hell's army, he can see his former wife, Wanda, once again.  And so this delightful piece of animation begins.  Simmons is now Spawn, back on earth with almost no memory, and the more he finds out, the less he likes.  Perhaps the deepest blow is that Wanda has married Simmons best friend and now has the child that Simmons could never give her.Spawn, desolate, confused, and torn between his own nature and hell's plans sulks in the dark alleyways where one the homeless are his company.  Or so it would be if the cover up of a child killing, illegitimate son of a presidential hopeful hadn't intruded in this dark no-man's-land.  Spawn, a super-powered killing machine takes out a small army of mafia clean-up men.  Soon this first confrontation turns into an escalating battle with the mafia, the senator, and clandestine government killers.  Spawn always wins the fights, but sometimes the price is too high.Inevitably the struggle extends itself to Spawn's ex-wife and her family.  Cyan, their little girl, falls into the hands of the serial killer and he must ruturn to the fray or allow her to be killed.  At this moment, he must decide whether he will keep his deal with the devil or attempt to become his own agent.  But save the child or not, kill the child molester or not, Spawn's will always be an outcast of the human race.  He is something only a demon could love.The directing team does a fine job of taking Todd McFarlane's original graphic stories and making an animated film from them.  This is American style animation, not Japanese, so expect strong illustration and use os stark shadows and edgy lighting.  Expect a love of violence and strong language as well.

The story on follds when al simmons,a goverment assasin is betrayed and killed by his boss jason wynn.  He then makes a deal with.....wait why am I telling you this.  Its spawn forcrying out loud!  Its one of the best comics ever made!I have all videos.  There very good.  Espissialy the second season.  The first season was outstanding too.This series is very ADULT orienteted.  With lots of graphic violence to make a 10 year old cry.  The series is awsome bottom line.  Its a damn shame they havent thought of making a 4th season but there to busy with the comic and lot has gone on for the comic so were should they start for a 4th season?the 3rd season left alot of people thinking what was going to happen next.  I doublt HBO will want a 4th I just think that.Over all the spawn series is great.I also wanted to mention....if people didnt know....this is not a movie.  Its episodes from the HBO series.  All the spawn videos are from the HBO series.  They just put all the episodes together to make it look like a movie.  I dont get how this is a collecters uncut mature edition.....THE SERIES WAS FOR MATURE AUDIENCES!  And now I see on the front cover its suppose to bea uncut collecters addition.  Well anyways the series on Tv waswasnt censored either I dont get why they said uncut collecters addition when the damn series was for adults on tv.  Well what ever, If you want to buy the tape on sale get it now cause the series is awsome.  But for the people who watched on HBO like me who taped it than dont get the tape.Over all its an awsome show.",5,Spawn is awsome!!!,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,1629,"['Spawn', 'shadow', 'doulbt', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'series', 'story', 'follds', 'when', 'al', 'simmons', 'goverment', 'assasin', 'betrayed', 'killed', 'boss', 'jason', 'wynn', 'then', 'deal', '..wait', 'why', 'am', 'telling', 'spawn', 'forcrying', 'out', 'loud', 'one', 'best', 'comics', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'videos', 'very', 'good', 'Espissialy', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'outstanding', 'too.This', 'series', 'very', 'ADULT', 'orienteted', 'lots', 'graphic', 'violence', 'make', '10', 'year', 'old', 'cry', 'series', 'awsome', 'bottom', 'line', 'damn', 'shame', 'havent', 'thought', 'making', '4th', 'season', 'there', 'busy', 'comic', 'lot', 'gone', 'comic', 'so', 'were', 'should', 'start', '4th', 'season', '3rd', 'season', 'left', 'alot', 'people', 'thinking', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'doublt', 'HBO', 'will', 'want', '4th', 'just', 'think', 'that.Over', 'spawn', 'series', 'great.I', 'also', 'wanted', 'mention', '.if', 'people', 'didnt', 'know', '.this', 'not', 'movie', 'episodes', 'HBO', 'series', 'spawn', 'videos', 'are', 'HBO', 'series', 'just', 'put', 'episodes', 'together', 'make', 'look', 'movie', 'dont', 'get', 'how', 'collecters', 'uncut', 'mature', 'edition', '..THE', 'SERIES', 'WAS', 'FOR', 'MATURE', 'AUDIENCES', 'now', 'see', 'front', 'cover', 'suppose', 'bea', 'uncut', 'collecters', 'addition', 'Well', 'series', 'Tv', 'waswasnt', 'censored', 'dont', 'get', 'why', 'said', 'uncut', 'collecters', 'addition', 'when', 'damn', 'series', 'was', 'adults', 'tv', 'Well', 'what', 'ever', 'want', 'buy', 'tape', 'sale', 'get', 'now', 'series', 'awsome', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'HBO', 'who', 'taped', 'dont', 'get', 'tape.Over', 'awsome', 'show']",N/A

If your a kid see the Spawn movie that would hook a kid aged 4-10. But this is what Spawn is really about an unwilling hero caught in a  cross-fire with heaven and hell. Trying to keep his sanity as he tries to  walk the path that will end his suffering. Spawn live action is like a  kiddie version of something that is not supposed to be.

This is actully a good cartoon. Just like the Heavy Metal series, there's plenty of gore, cursing, and nudity, to the point it's disturbing! It stays loyal to the comic, as in the characters are all drawn the same way, the plot's the same (unlike the live-action movie;but it's still good), and all the chracters' attitudes are the same. I believe it was directed by Todd McFarlane (creater), so you can see why. If it seems familar, you probably have amensia or have HBO, which this aired on for about a year or so.If you liked this, check out the other 2 Spawn movies, the live-action movie, and the Heavy Metal series.",4,"Good, but a little disturbing.",1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,762,"['rented', '2', 'weekago', 'when', 'got', 'box', 'accidently', 'instead', 'live-action', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'COMMPLETLY', 'dissappoited', 'actully', 'good', 'cartoon', 'Just', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'series', 'plenty', 'gore', 'cursing', 'nudity', 'point', 'disturbing', 'loyal', 'comic', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'same', 'way', 'plot', 'same', 'live-action', 'movie', 'still', 'good', 'chracters', 'attitudes', 'are', 'same', 'believe', 'was', 'directed', 'Todd', 'McFarlane', 'creater', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'familar', 'probably', 'have', 'amensia', 'have', 'HBO', 'aired', 'year', 'so.If', 'liked', 'check', 'out', 'other', '2', 'Spawn', 'movies', 'live-action', 'movie', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'series']",N/A
