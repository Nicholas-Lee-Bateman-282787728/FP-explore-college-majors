But at 18months with teething molars we finally let the babies watch this DVD once per day. They LOVE LOVE LOVE this video and now ask for it. We don't watch DVDs for developmental purposes, but this DVD is very calm, not too flashy and has many basic shapes, symbols, and imagery. They are captivated and sit calmly watching it. The music is very calming and will interrupt the ""fussies"". Frankly the music is calming to me as I'm racing around the house cleaning up. the lyrics beautiful and just gives us a peaceful atmosphere for a few minutes. HIGHLY recommend especially for those who aren't interested in overstimulating their children.",5,"Calm, Captivating, and Soothing music",1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,762,"['Honestly', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'DVD', 'thought', 'was', 'dumb', 'images', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'up', 'lyrics', 'music', '18months', 'teething', 'molars', 'finally', 'let', 'babies', 'watch', 'DVD', 'once', 'day', 'LOVE', 'LOVE', 'LOVE', 'video', 'now', 'ask', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'DVDs', 'developmental', 'purposes', 'DVD', 'very', 'calm', 'not', 'too', 'flashy', 'many', 'basic', 'shapes', 'symbols', 'imagery', 'are', 'captivated', 'sit', 'calmly', 'watching', 'music', 'very', 'calming', 'will', 'interrupt', 'fussies', 'Frankly', 'music', 'calming', ""'m"", 'racing', 'house', 'cleaning', 'up', 'lyrics', 'beautiful', 'just', 'peaceful', 'atmosphere', 'few', 'minutes', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'especially', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'overstimulating', 'children']",The Praise Baby Collection: God of Wonders

The sooth her in a way that I cannot even explain. Worship music set to fun vivid images it great for your little one's attention span and interest. Now that she is older we interact more with DVD by talking about what is in the pictures. These movies are life savers. I must say they enchant the baby in sense. We can having a full blown fit, put in Praise Baby and everything calms down, as soon as she hears the logo music she is looking for the TV. I also ordered the music on discs for the car and it has a similar effect.Introducing music into your baby's life is easy with Praise Baby. Many discs have multiple features including different vocal tracks: adult, children and even instrumental tracks. Some also have a repeat option - which I use on occasion so we can hear the calming music during our day, most of the time we are not even in the room.I highly recommend this product, there are many well know Praise songs, this disc has some of my favorites and I know your baby will love them too. One of my favorite memories is my 4 month old singing along with Praise Baby!",5,My Baby's Favorite Series - 2nd Favorite Disc,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,1224,"['movies', 'are', 'enchanting', 'little', 'loved', 'Praise', 'Baby', 'was', 'about', '2', 'months', 'old', 'love', '17', 'months', 'old', 'sooth', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'explain', 'Worship', 'music', 'set', 'fun', 'vivid', 'images', 'great', 'little', 'one', 'attention', 'span', 'interest', 'Now', 'older', 'interact', 'more', 'DVD', 'talking', 'what', 'pictures', 'movies', 'are', 'life', 'savers', 'must', 'say', 'enchant', 'baby', 'sense', 'can', 'having', 'full', 'blown', 'fit', 'put', 'Praise', 'Baby', 'everything', 'calms', 'down', 'as', 'soon', 'logo', 'music', 'looking', 'TV', 'also', 'ordered', 'music', 'discs', 'car', 'similar', 'effect.Introducing', 'music', 'baby', 'life', 'easy', 'Praise', 'Baby', 'Many', 'discs', 'have', 'multiple', 'features', 'including', 'different', 'vocal', 'tracks', 'adult', 'children', 'even', 'instrumental', 'tracks', 'also', 'have', 'repeat', 'option', 'use', 'occasion', 'can', 'hear', 'calming', 'music', 'day', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'room.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'product', 'are', 'many', 'well', 'know', 'Praise', 'songs', 'disc', 'favorites', 'know', 'baby', 'will', 'love', 'too', 'One', 'favorite', 'memories', '4', 'month', 'old', 'singing', 'Praise', 'Baby']",The Praise Baby Collection: God of Wonders

Schmidt ""TotalHavoc""","[0, 0]","Having noticed the way my daughter loved watching the ""Praises and Smiles"" DVD we already had, I decdied to purchase this DVD for her 2md birthday.  I was not disappointed.  This DVD captures her interest as much as the other DVD and I find the uplifting songs to be a much more useful way for her to learn the songs we do in church, than just hearing them at church.  Having listened to her try to sing the songs from ""Praises and Smiles"", I know she will pick these ones up as well.If your child is a music-lover, this DVD will be a great addition to any collection.",5,A great choice for your child,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,568,"['Having', 'noticed', 'way', 'daughter', 'loved', 'watching', 'Praises', 'Smiles', 'DVD', 'already', 'had', 'decdied', 'purchase', 'DVD', '2md', 'birthday', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'interest', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'DVD', 'find', 'uplifting', 'songs', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'useful', 'way', 'learn', 'songs', 'do', 'church', 'just', 'hearing', 'church', 'Having', 'listened', 'try', 'sing', 'songs', 'Praises', 'Smiles', 'know', 'will', 'pick', 'ones', 'up', 'well.If', 'child', 'music-lover', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'addition', 'collection']",The Praise Baby Collection: God of Wonders
