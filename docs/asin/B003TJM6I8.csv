1362148,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B003TJM6I8,Anthony L.,"[1, 1]","Look, I'm not inhuman.Everybody loves Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private, with their zany military operations and &#34;cunning&#34; plans, not to mention the hilarious band of lemurs - King Julien, Maurice, and Mort. So do I, and when they are onscreen, they really have their moments. The whole audience laughs hard! There are jokes in here that are surprisingly funny, and some cunning word-play and punning occasionally get written in. For that I give the show 4 stars.But this otherwise good show is hampered by plots so simple they could have come out of a cookie-cutter, some really cheesy and cliched moments, and some episodes that just have some plain bad writing (I shuddered at the episode where Julien loses his crown. It's just bad.) And that's not all. A sizeable portion of the show's humor is just plain crude. I'm not talking about the slapstick, I'm talking about the fart jokes, elephant bottom jokes, and generally poorly written original characters - the otter, the elephants, etc.In conclusion, when the show sticks to what was in the movies - the hilarious penguins and lemurs, it does well, and everything is often very, very funny. However, there's little else to recommend, and so I deduct 2 stars.Recommended for little kids (this will keep them occupied for hours, as I know all too well (I have a four year old brother!)).3.5 Stars!",3,Zany characters mix with stale jokes...,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,1363,"['Look', ""'m"", 'not', 'inhuman.Everybody', 'Skipper', 'Kowalski', 'Rico', 'Private', 'zany', 'military', 'operations', '34', 'cunning', '34', 'plans', 'not', 'mention', 'hilarious', 'band', 'lemurs', 'King', 'Julien', 'Maurice', 'Mort', 'So', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'onscreen', 'really', 'have', 'moments', 'whole', 'audience', 'hard', 'are', 'jokes', 'here', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'cunning', 'word-play', 'punning', 'occasionally', 'get', 'written', 'give', 'show', '4', 'stars.But', 'otherwise', 'good', 'show', 'hampered', 'plots', 'so', 'simple', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'cookie-cutter', 'really', 'cheesy', 'cliched', 'moments', 'episodes', 'just', 'have', 'plain', 'bad', 'writing', 'shuddered', 'episode', 'where', 'Julien', 'crown', 'just', 'bad', 'not', 'A', 'sizeable', 'portion', 'show', 'humor', 'just', 'plain', 'crude', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'slapstick', ""'m"", 'talking', 'fart', 'jokes', 'elephant', 'bottom', 'jokes', 'generally', 'poorly', 'written', 'original', 'characters', 'otter', 'elephants', 'etc.In', 'conclusion', 'when', 'show', 'what', 'was', 'movies', 'hilarious', 'penguins', 'lemurs', 'well', 'everything', 'often', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'However', 'little', 'else', 'recommend', 'so', 'deduct', '2', 'stars.Recommended', 'little', 'kids', 'will', 'keep', 'occupied', 'hours', 'know', 'too', 'well', 'have', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'brother', '.3.5', 'Stars']",The Penguins Of Madagascar: New To The Zoo
