23813,A319KYEIAZ3SON,0773386726,Mary Whipple,"[2, 2]","In this unusual Morse episode, Inspector Lewis is away, Inspector Morse is on sick leave, and the murder has taken place more than one hundred forty years in the past.  Morse has suffered an attack of bleeding ulcers (depicted in gory detail) and is in the hospital, where Dr. Millicent Van Buren, an American academic lecturing at Oxford, brings him her book about a murder from 1859 and the double hanging that followed the trial in 1860.Morse reads only ten pages before he decides that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  While he is hospitalized, he conducts the research (with the aid of a young policeman) that shows the social conditions of the boatmen, the lives of the underclass, and the ""justice"" that is imposed by upperclass justices on poor defendants who are even not allowed to testify in their own defense.Morse (John Thaw) is in weakened condition, but still gruff and cross, while is he is hospitalized, and once free, he brazenly ignores the conditions of his release, continuing his research, and his love of ale.  Lisa Eichhorn, as Monica Van Buren, is stilted and awkward in her role as the author whose conclusions Morse challenges, but Matthew Finney as PC Adrian Kershaw, a new constable and an Oxford graduate in history, appointed by Chief Strange to assist Morse, is engaging and able to add to Morse's knowledge while exhibiting charm and intelligence.  Judy Loe, as Morse's current girlfriend, adds warmth and interest, keeping Morse in line while providing support for him.As the plot unfolds and becomes more complex with the discoveries that Kershaw makes in the archives and in the original trial manuscripts, the episode becomes more challenging and interesting.  The emphasis on history engages the viewer on a level beyond that of mere plot, while the conditions under which the boatmen and their passengers existed elicits sympathy for them.Many dramatic scenes occur here, and Morse's trip to western Ireland provides a change of scenery and a new focus.  Morse's health becomes a major issue (which continues in the episodes at the very end of the series), and the viewer sees him in a new context.  Fun to watch, and different in its focus from most other Morse mysteries, The Wench is Dead is an historical mystery with a modern touch. n Mary Whipple",4,"""To make an end is to make a beginning.

23814,A35DI28HRSEEP6,0773386726,Richard B. Schwartz,"[1, 1]","This is a very special episode, for Morse is taken ill and is 'in hospital' for much of the story.  While there he takes an interest in a Victorian murder case.  With the help of a young assistant he solves the case, reversing the Victorian verdict.  The story cuts between present time and Victorian times, with the case reenacted in period costume and sets.  The production values are very high; the story is fascinating and even the ulcerated Morse energized and effective.  There is only one problem.  Lewis is off to Inspector school and is not in this episode.The case concerns the murder/rape/robbery of a young woman, travelling to London via the canal.  She is the former assistant of a magician who was her first husband.  Or so we are told . . .Highly recommended.",5,A very special Morse,1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,775,"['very', 'special', 'episode', 'Morse', 'taken', 'ill', ""'in"", 'hospital', 'much', 'story', 'interest', 'Victorian', 'murder', 'case', 'help', 'young', 'assistant', 'case', 'reversing', 'Victorian', 'verdict', 'story', 'cuts', 'present', 'time', 'Victorian', 'times', 'case', 'reenacted', 'period', 'costume', 'sets', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'story', 'fascinating', 'even', 'ulcerated', 'Morse', 'energized', 'effective', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'Lewis', 'Inspector', 'school', 'not', 'episode.The', 'case', 'murder/rape/robbery', 'young', 'woman', 'travelling', 'London', 'canal', 'former', 'assistant', 'magician', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'husband', 'are', 'told', '.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
23815,A2EXZ4N9INMT6O,0773386726,William J. Thor,"[5, 5]","This episode is the 32nd of the 33 in the series, so we have moved along a few years - Morse is just two years from retirement.  While attending a book lecture featuring detection methods in the Victorian era, given by the American author Dr. Millicent Van Buren, Morse has a rather serious medical emergency.  The problem is with his digestive system and puts him in hospital where Dr. Van Buren visits and presents him with a copy of her Victorian book.  He finds one particular case that intrigues him, so much so that he decides to re-visit the entire affair - in hospital and particularly after he is released.  Using flashbacks coupled with current day forensic analysis we have a strong episode.  Superintendent Strange receives more screen time than usual and Sergeant Lewis is replaced by Constable Kershaw for this episode, but it doesn't make much difference, Morse is the one that makes this series work.  Our music is limited to snippets of Mozart's Clarinet Concerto K 622, chamber background, and Victorian era light fare. However there is a love interest - Adele Cecil; Morse refers to her at one point as his ""significant other."" Although they indicate they do not live together, it is clear they have a relationship.  This one belongs among the group of Morse's best entries - of which there are a great many.",5,1859 Redux,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,1327,"['episode', '32nd', '33', 'series', 'have', 'moved', 'few', 'years', 'Morse', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'retirement', 'attending', 'book', 'lecture', 'featuring', 'detection', 'methods', 'Victorian', 'era', 'given', 'American', 'author', 'Dr.', 'Millicent', 'Van', 'Buren', 'Morse', 'rather', 'serious', 'medical', 'emergency', 'problem', 'digestive', 'system', 'hospital', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Van', 'Buren', 'visits', 'presents', 'copy', 'Victorian', 'book', 'one', 'particular', 'case', 'so', 'much', 're-visit', 'entire', 'affair', 'hospital', 'particularly', 'released', 'Using', 'flashbacks', 'coupled', 'current', 'day', 'forensic', 'analysis', 'have', 'strong', 'episode', 'Superintendent', 'Strange', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'usual', 'Sergeant', 'Lewis', 'replaced', 'Constable', 'Kershaw', 'episode', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'Morse', 'one', 'series', 'work', 'music', 'limited', 'snippets', 'Mozart', 'Clarinet', 'Concerto', 'K', '622', 'chamber', 'background', 'Victorian', 'era', 'light', 'fare', 'However', 'love', 'interest', 'Adele', 'Cecil', 'Morse', 'refers', 'one', 'point', 'significant', 'other', 'indicate', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'together', 'clear', 'have', 'relationship', 'one', 'group', 'Morse', 'best', 'entries', 'are', 'great', 'many']",N/A
