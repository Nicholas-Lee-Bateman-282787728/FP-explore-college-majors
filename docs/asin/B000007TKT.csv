495182,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000007TKT,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 30]","I must say that I am very open to new film, bold styles of filmmaking, and the opportunity to see the obscure, but I am not open to a lack of excitement.  I thought that this was an interesting first film for Trey Parker to create while in film school, but I think the hype behind this movie and one of the reasons that it is referred to as a ""cult"" film is because of the South Park fame that has subsequently followed this team.  Personally, I didn't see the value in this picture at all.  The actors seemed unexcited to be in the picture, the story seemed flimsy at best, and the songs had the feeling of third-gradery to them.  Don't get me wrong, I am always excited about seeing student films and how powerful a fresh mind can be, but in this film I just felt that Parker was trying to press certain buttons, but failed miserably.  His comedy was not funny, his scenes of gore can be credited towards Troma, and the references to South Park continued to boost my impression that this film became popular after their South Park inheritance.  Parker had no control over this film, no control over his actors, and most importantly, no control over himself.  It is difficult for me to watch a film where the main character is only giving 15% at best.Again, I would like to stress that I am not against this type of filmmaking ... when it is done right.  In the case of Cannibal! The Musical I didn't feel that there were any elements that stood out, seemed creative, or were original.  Parker seemed to be going for the shock value more than creating a decent piece of cinema.  To begin, the characters were all one-dimensional.  I cared nothing for the band of men stuck in the Colorado area without any food.  If they died or if they survived, I could have cared less.  I didn't know them, I didn't get to know them, and Parker wasn't allowing me to see them as three-dimensional people, so my sympathy towards them further plummeted this film.  Everyone in this film was silly and stupid instead of funny and independent.  I went into this film wanting to see a sharp, independent film that would surprise me and make me laugh.  The characters of this film brought that concept to a complete halt.  Packer was the worst, providing no emotion at all to his character and simply whispering all of his words.  It was pathetic and a very sad sight to see.  Then, as if the other actors were following suit, they brought nothing emotional or comedic to the table, but instead went through their lines and did the bare minimum that they had to.  I would have to say that the failure of this film began with the actors poorly giving us any decent characters.Another failed element was the story, which seemed to jump around all over the place like a scratched CD.  The film technique of making us believe that this was a ""true"" story by using pseudo-documentary moments just hurt this film more than helping it.  It made the overall production seem cheap and uninformative.  There was no consistency or excitement to get from one scene to the next, and I think a reason for this was the poor choice of songs.  This was to be a musical, and I have seen Matt and Trey write songs (see South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut) that were both humorous and powerful, but in this film, they just felt like eight year olds created them.  You could tell that they were dubbed over and that some of the actors didn't even know all the lines to the songs.  These are elements that need to be addressed during production because it could either make or break a film ... and in this case it broke it.  The only song that I found myself breaking a smile was the ""Let's Build a Snowman!"" ditty that at least showcased some originality.  Outside of that, I don't believe that I broke a smile once during this film, and this was to be a comedy?Finally, I would like to say that you can not create a film with the idea that it will become a ""cult"" film over time.  I could see this pompous nature in Parker as he was creating this film.  During his performance as Packer, you could see that glimmer in his eye that screamed, ""This will be bigger than we imagined because smart people that love South Park will love this later in life.""  It nearly made me wretch.  These actors knew what they were doing, and I think Troma did as well, since all are now cashing in on this film since the popularity of South Park.  There just seemed to be this aura of arrogance while I watched the film that hampered my enjoyment.Overall, I was very unimpressed.  I was expecting bigger, bolder, and much more creativity behind this feature than what was presented.  As I watch what these boys can create now, I cannot help but think that they have a much smarter head on their shoulders than Cannibal! The Musical presented.  This could have been a very lucrative and intelligent film, but instead they seemed to make it just a cheap production with a catchy name and simplistic songs.  I do not recommend this film, unless you are in desperate need of more sleep at night and desire to see the boys of South Park finally fail!Grade: * out of *****",1,Oh my God!

Unfortunately, that included this filmBack in college, Parker did a play about some guy in Colorado history called Alfred Packer. Later, he made a movie out of it. No one would publish it until he became famous, at which point the great Troma team published itThis is a musical. Like most Parker films, this one is about Mormons. About half dialog, half singing. Standard cast (Matt Stone, Screech, other UColorado alumni). Surprisingly, there are almost no jokes here - this isn't really a comedy. Well, maybe it is since all the characters act odd (stone is a liar, parker loves his horse, Screech wants to have sex, another guy is always happy), but no one really tells jokes or does anything really unrealistic. Despite supposedly being a cannibal movie, it's not really shocking or antisocial. It's just sort of a historical pic with some really bad songs (the reporter's love song, the schpedoinkle day song). Oh yeah, the plot - Parker (Alfred Packer) leads a bunch of mormons to colorado in the winter. If the movie was 90 minutes, about 70 minutes of it is spent talking about walking and whether they're lost. Maybe 5 minutes is spent when the freezing party eats a guy who was already dead. It's a slow paced movieOK, the movie wasn't all bad. For starters, my easily-offended, churchy boy roommate thought it was hilarious. The trapper song is great.

Although there are some pretty hilarious and rude gags, overall, &quot;Cannibal!&quot; is a very nice movie, a Troma movie you can see with your girlfriend.Admittedly, it's not a professional production in any way, shape, or form, although Parker's energy level and willingness to play with the obvious anachronisms make the amateur production values part of the gag.  Parker seems more comfortable with animation than live action (behold the &quot;South Park&quot; movie), but he does a decent job here.Where this movie really stands out is the sound; the DVD has Parker's approved sound mix and he crams it with gags.  You have to pay close attention with ears and eyes to catch everything (which you won't, at least not the first time around), for which Parker deserves kudos.There are only two parts of the DVD that bug me; one, the extras have more to do with Troma than with Cannibal, although we do get clips from the Cannibal stage show and an audio commentary that's a riot, and the Troma Intelligence Test is pretty amusing.  Two, if you've seen the movie on Cinemax or before Parker and Stone took off, then you know there's a short deleted sequence, the &quot;Don't Be Stupid&quot; song.  It's been axed from this print of the movie, and it's nowhere to be found on the disc.  This is annoying and if there's an explanation for this unnecessary edit, I haven't found it.But that doesn't reduce the entertainment value.

It contains alot of Parker's trademark touches that informed his later work in ""South Park"" and ""Team America"" such as it's outrageous humor and goofy songs.  The film is conventional in some ways in relaying the story of Alfred Packer and his doomed expedition into the Colorado Territories in the late 19th century and at heart there is a certain innocence in this endeavor.  It's definitely a low-budget affair but it is compensated with the high spirited stylings of Parker's direction.  Those turned off by the film's title fear not.

However, if I were to look at it from a Hollywood stance, it is pure schlock.  I don't look at things like Hollywood does, so this film still stands tall with me.  Cannibal! The Musical is a delightful farce of the horror and musical genre that began as a trailer for a film class and erupted into a full length cheese fest.  The acting is atrocious, but everyone knows they suck so it really doesn't matter because they're having such fun.  The story centralizes around Alfred Packard, the only man to ever be convicted of cannibalism in the United States.  After getting a party lost in the wildnerness while on the way to Colorado, Packard decides to get them even more lost by following the trail of his lost horse, Leann.While this summary is the plot of the story, it really doesn't matter, because when you either purchase or rent a movie named Cannibal! The Musical, it's my guess that you're not looking for twists and plot development.  You're looking for stupidity, and that is what you get.  The songs are quite well written and funny and can even rival some of the songs written by the terrific Rogers and Hammerstein.  Like I have said previously, the acting is horrible, but you expect that.  The sets and costumes are even worse (wait until you see the TP's!).Like I have said in the previous paragraphs, this film was not intended to be an award winner at all.

For instance, I recently couldn't find a copy of ""State and Main"" (or, for that matter, ""Rocky""), but unbelievably, there was ""Cannibal! The Musical"" sitting right there in the comedy section.  My best friend and I were in a warped mood, so we picked it up without a moment of hesitation.With tongue planted firmly in cheek, a young and peculiarly gaunt Trey Parker (or Juan Schwartz, if you prefer) undertakes the task of recreating cult historical figure Alferd Packer -- the dude who was convicted of cannibalism sometime in the mid-1800s-ish -- with the assistance of a college-aged cast and crew and a nonexistent budget.While the comedy loses steam when it should be reaching its apex, as many comedies are wont to do, the humor is nonetheless fresh, alternating between whimsy and bite.  The gore scenes weren't my favorite, as I am a squeamish girly-girl equipped with a quirky sense of humor but a low tolerance for gross-out jokes.  I was, however, amused with the anachronistic tendencies (one character would call someone a ""Gosh-darned so-and-so!"" while another would out-and-out call someone an a--hole).  And, in an unrelated thought: as I'm sure you've already heard in everybody else's reviews, there is an excellent song called ""Let's Build a Snowman!"" Joy in the face of adversity, that's what musical theater is all about.The movie (which looks exactly like what it is -- a college production) smartly mocks the genre of musical theater.  Yet it simultaneously, and paradoxically, embodies the doe-eyed enthusiasm and naivet&eacute; it supposedly resents, in a way only a rebellious-but-hopeful young cast, in the purgatory between youth and adulthood, could possibly bring to fruition.Hey! There's also a fantabulous cowbell solo, which made me long for my Special Lad (who is a drummer of occasionally questionable talent).

Meeley,"[0, 0]","Created long before they dropped the world of &#34;South Park&#34; on the universe, this is the first work by the satirical geniuses, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Steeped in the traditions of using toilet humor and music, which they have come to make famous, they tackle the true story of one of the most harrowing and gruesome events in American history.While the subject matter would seem ill-advised for comedic trope, they manage to make it funny with the many outlandish and ludicrous situations and songs to keep this parody palatable. The song &#34;Let's Build A Snowman&#34; is one that will quickly get stuck into your brain and you'll be singing along with, before you know it.The opening scene is quite bloody and macabre, which will serve to remind you that this event was no bag of laughs for those who were involved, but the lowbrow and slapstick nature of the humor will keep you laughing throughout the proceedings. Like watching a chef hone their skills, you will get a very good look at the style of humor Parker and Stone would make a staple of their career. It's obvious this film is very near and dear to them, as the opening song, &#34;It's a Shpdoinkle Day,&#34; is still played at the end of every episode of &#34;South Park.&#34; This is a bit more lower budget than some of their later films, like &#34;Orgazmo&#34; and &#34;BASEketball,&#34; but the true talent of these twisted minds still shines through. The overall transfer of the DVD is pretty good, which is a bit surprising coming from Troma, and is one of the best films from the company's catalog.If you are a fan of Parker and Stone's other works, then you'll need to have this film in your collection (if you don't already).

The Musical is intentionally cheesy which makes it amazing. This is Trey Parker's first movie he did when he was 21 in college recreates the true story about Alfred Packer, the first man to ever be accused of cannibalism. He goes on a journey for gold with a couple other guys (South Park co-creator Matt Stone is one of them) and they get lost. Lots of stupid stuff happens especially how the one dude started going crazy and tried building snow men. There's a good amount of gore too to make the movie even more hilarious. The first scene shows Trey killing off everyone with his bare hands, which he allegdly did. Then there's the one part of the movie where a guy gets stabbed a bunch of times in the face!The funny thing about this film is it also relfects on Trey Parker's real life. In the movie, his horse, Leanne, that he loved so much, leaves him. Just like how in real life Trey's fiance, Leanne, left him. The ironic thing about Trey's ex-fiance though was that she even did the corepgraphy for one part of the movie. You'll get a lot of interesting info from the &quot;liquored up&quot; director's commentary. Another interesting fact: There's some Japanes Indians in the film and the chief is some guy that owns a Sushi Bar in Colorado in real life.If you love South Park, this is a mandatory watch. Without this movie, I don't think South Park would be what it is as you know it today. You'll hear Mr. Garrison and Cartman's voice in the movie for a couple seconds, their first appearances I think. And the main theme song of this movie is the same song used at the end credits of each episode of South Park, when they show that airplane thing fly by.This is a cult classic, I watched it like ten times in a week because I watned to hear the music and see the gory parts again. There's also a nice love story so it's not all just about outrageuos humor. One of the better Troma releases too.

495205,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000007TKT,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[41, 43]","If you have never sat all the way through a Troma film or have never found anything about ""South Park"" to be funny, then do not bother to watch ""Cannibal! The Musical,"" because you are not going to enjoy it.  Matt Stone is around in 1993 when this film was made (but not released to mass consumption until 1996), but Trey Parker gets the primary credit for not only writing the script and songs, but also directing and starring as Alfred Packer (and the Cow Bell Guy).In 1873 Packer and five prospectors were snowbound, lost and hungry in the San Juans of Colorado.  Only Packer returned alive and when the other bodies were discovered it was clear they had been eaten.  Parker was eventually convicted of murder and not cannibalism, although Colorado lore likes to claim he was ""the only man in U.S. history ever convicted of cannibalism.""  At the University of Colorado at the grill at the Student Union is named the Alferd Packer Grill (the spelling of Packer's first name is but one of several points of dispute in the story).Parker and Stone were students at Colorado and so it is not surprising that Parker would turn Packer story into a musical.  The film was originally entitled ""Alfred Packer: The Musical"", but Troma's owner Lloyd Kaufman argued for the name change because while Packer is a legendary figure in Colorado, his cannibalistic claim of fame is little known outside of the state.Actually, there is not as much cannibalism as you would think in this movie, and there are certainly enough songs.  The latter is the bigger complaint, because the songs are the best part of the film and the funniest parts as well.  The humor outside of the songs is just not that ambitious: the best bits are the Nihonjin ""Indians"" being played by Japanese (with ""Nihonjin"" being Japanese for ""Japanese"") and the debate as to whether ""The Trapper Song"" was in F sharp major or E flat minor (as the relative major of F sharp with the relative minor being three half-tones down).  And if you do not know that the lead characer is going to be offered fudge at some point, you have just not been thinking ahead.  The good news is that when you get to the ""Finger Food"" extras you can go back and do the songs, not only as they appear in the film but also as performed in a live version of ""Cannibal! The Musical"" by the Dad's Garage Theater Copany.As he proved in ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut,"" Parker can master the nuances of the musical forms identified with both Broadway and popular song.  It is hard not to think of Curly opening ""Oklahoma"" when Parker as Packer shows up and starts singing:The sky is blue and all the leaves are green.The sun's as warm as a baked potato.I think I know precisely what I mean,When I say it's a shpadoinkle day.My favorite song has to be ""Ode to Liane"" (a.k.a. ""When I Was on Top of You""), which Packer ostensibly sings to his horse, but which Parker apparently wrote to revenge himself on an ex-girlfriend who obviously did not know what sort of person she had dumped (she also contributes to her own demise by doing the choreography for the big finale and dancing in it as well).  I also like ""This Side of Me,"" sung by reporter Polly Pry (Toddy Walters), which is a sweet little song about a woman's forgotten side, until one little line in the final chorus skews it a wee bit.  The ""Trapper Song"" and the big finale, ""Hang the Bastard!"" are the big productive numbers, relatively speaking.  It really is much more of a Cowboy musical than a cannibal music (notice the lowercase ""c"" for ""cannibal"") and once you understand that you can stop closing your eyes in anticipation of the eating of human flesh.As you would expect the DVD is loaded with extras that exaggerate the importance of this film, including Parker, Stone and several other cast members who gather together to get drunk while watching the movie.  But if you can take a three-minute trailer as a joke for film class and then raise enough money to actually make a movie that gets sold to Troma, home of ""The Toxic Avenger,"" that is your basic American success story.  It was because of this movie that Parker and Stone were able to go to Hollywood and eventually end up doing be ""South Park"" and thereby corrupting a much larger segment of America's youth than are ever going to stumble on this movie.  Finally, if you are looking for some sort of profound and deep meaning to all of this, I would refer you to the lyrics of ""Let's Build a Snowman! Part I,"" which evince a sense of relativism that usually found in the current post-modernism tradition:Sometimes, the world is black.And tears run from your eyes.And maybe we'll all get really sick.And maybe we'll all die.So...Let's build a snowman!We can make him our best friend.We can name him Tom or we can name him George!We can make him tall, or we can make him not so

There is also 2 intro's, the original and a newer one from Troma head Andy Kauffman, there not really worth looking at again.... there is a few interviews about the film with Trey Parker and MattStone, theres some didgey behind the scenes footage, there is a silly game from Troma to test your knowledge on there films, if you get the question right, you get to see a short clip of some racks.. but if you get it wrong, you get a clip of blood and gore and people being crushed in bad ways... all clips from different Troma films... theres a few trailers, not just ones for CTM either... there is a tour of Troma, you can select a room to veiw and go on a joke tour of Troma headquarters... there is a public service announcement, which is a scene from a more recent film Trey and Matt did with Troma.. and there is also a commentary, which doesnt give you much insight into the film, it mostly contains Trey, Matt, Jason Hughs, Dian Bucher, Andy Klemer making fun of there film and each other, and Matt Stone farting into the mic every few minutes as they all get drunk.It's a great DVD package from Troma, well worth the money you pay for it, excellent presentation in its digitaly remastered format, the only 2 things i have a pet peeve about is it doesnt have any deleted scenes, or Subtitles... but it's still a great package!Remember tho, this movie is rated R, it's not a kids or fammily movie, it's not for anyone who wants to see some great acting, it's basicly.....well, it's like a real time version of South Park, with the same over the top antics... so sit back, leave your IQ at the door, and enjoy the film!It's a Shaboinkel movie!",4,"a ""shaboikel"" DVD from Tromaville",1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,2528,"['Trey', 'Parker', 'South', 'Park/Orgazmo/Baseketball', 'independent', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'Alfred', 'Packer', 'not', 'quite', 'movie', 'would', 'sit', 'family', 'enjoy', 'quite', 'disgusting', 'times', 'blood', 'gore', 'nudity', 'bonus', 'features', 'fair', 'bit', 'bad', 'langauge', 'thats', 'why', 'love', 'it.Trey', 'not', 'made', 'kind', 'acadamey', 'award', 'winning', 'movie', 'Tromo', 'film', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'silly', 'acting', 'here', 'there', 'goofyness', 'weird', 'bits', 'now', 'then', 'comedy', 'group', 'man', 'who', 'last', 'survivor', 'ill-fated', 'trip', 'Colorado', 'Territoy', 'story', 'what', 'really', 'happend', 'when', 'convicted', 'cannibalism', 'Also', 'dont', 'forget', 'musical', 'sort', 'of.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'completly', 'packed', 'extras', 'South', 'Park', 'kind', 'feel', 'animations', 'menus', 'also', '2', 'intro', 'original', 'newer', 'one', 'Troma', 'head', 'Andy', 'Kauffman', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'looking', 'again', 'few', 'interviews', 'film', 'Trey', 'Parker', 'MattStone', 'didgey', 'scenes', 'footage', 'silly', 'game', 'Troma', 'test', 'knowledge', 'films', 'get', 'question', 'right', 'get', 'see', 'short', 'clip', 'racks..', 'get', 'wrong', 'get', 'clip', 'blood', 'gore', 'people', 'being', 'crushed', 'bad', 'ways', 'clips', 'different', 'Troma', 'films', 'few', 'trailers', 'not', 'just', 'ones', 'CTM', 'tour', 'Troma', 'can', 'select', 'room', 'veiw', 'go', 'joke', 'tour', 'Troma', 'headquarters', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'scene', 'more', 'recent', 'film', 'Trey', 'Matt', 'did', 'Troma..', 'also', 'commentary', 'doesnt', 'give', 'much', 'insight', 'film', 'mostly', 'Trey', 'Matt', 'Jason', 'Hughs', 'Dian', 'Bucher', 'Andy', 'Klemer', 'making', 'fun', 'film', 'other', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'farting', 'mic', 'few', 'minutes', 'get', 'drunk.It', 'great', 'DVD', 'package', 'Troma', 'well', 'money', 'pay', 'excellent', 'presentation', 'digitaly', 'remastered', 'format', 'only', '2', 'things', 'i', 'have', 'pet', 'peeve', 'doesnt', 'have', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Subtitles', 'still', 'great', 'package', 'Remember', 'tho', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'not', 'kids', 'fammily', 'movie', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'great', 'acting', 'basicly', '..well', 'real', 'time', 'version', 'South', 'Park', 'same', 'top', 'antics', 'so', 'sit', 'back', 'leave', 'IQ', 'door', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Shaboinkel', 'movie']",N/A
495210,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B000007TKT,Mike Stone,"[4, 5]","Trey Parker has made a name for himself (at least in my eyes) as a remarkable triple-threat auteur, who's various strengths are shown to varying degrees in this comical odyssey.Parker's strength as an actor is twofold.  First, he has a look of innocence about him, which is a wonder because it conceals a hyper-healthy subversive streak.  He has these mopey wide eyes that may as well be sparkling, a goofy kid grin, and a perfect gee-whiz-aww-shucks quality to the way he speaks.  Second, he manages to inject complete sincerity into the most ridiculous scenes (especially when he's singing) without a trace of irony.  He understands his own material well enough to know that if he exaggerated his actions the humour would deflate.  Co-star (and &quot;Orgazmo&quot; vet) Dian Bachar acquits himself equally well in this way, as a young man anxious for gold and woman (though not necessarily in that order).  Contrast this with his partner Matt Stone's over-the-top acting style.  Stone gets a lot of great lines here, but his lispy speech and contorted facial expressions nearly ruin the gags.  Parker never falls into that trap.Parker the director tries his best to spread his wings, but is hampered by his film's measly budget.  He has a tough time overcoming the cheap sound, cinematography and special effects he's saddled with.  Sam Raimi, in similar circumstances with his &quot;Evil Dead&quot; movies, managed to create gloriously fun moments with his supreme inventiveness in editing.  Parker tries his best, and nearly succeeds at times, but can't fully achieve his cinematic vision.Which is fine, because he does achieve massive success with his songs.  And this being a musical, I suppose that the songs are key.  Anyone who enjoyed his surreal odes to a certain &quot;mountain town&quot; in &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut&quot; will surely get a kick out of the tunes Trey's come up with here.  Peppy opener &quot;It's a Shpadoinkle Day&quot; sets the stage (&quot;the sun is hot like a baked potatoe!&quot;), followed by &quot;When I Was On Top of You&quot; (a double-entendred filled paean to, you guessed it... his horse!), and &quot;Let's Build a Snowman&quot; (which rightfully entails execution to anyone who sings it).  The final, showstopping number, &quot;Hang the Bastard&quot;, even features some nifty choreography and a rockin' cowbell solo!  The remaining songs, while sometimes hampered by poor sound and unintelligible lyrics (&quot;The Trapper Song&quot; being the cruelest victim), are comic masterpieces.  Parker deserves additional credit for co-writing the score, which is uproariously cheesy but perfect for the film.The jokes here aren't as fast and furious as I expected, which makes them tougher to spot when they do come along.  Some of my favourites include: the expedition's Mormon contingency repeatedly threatening to send a particular rowdy member to &quot;take a time out&quot;; a group of ruffian trappers who have their gang name (it's &quot;Trappers&quot;, natch) sewn on to the back of their pelt jackets; and Parker's incredulous reaction to the old villain-who-won't-die-even-when-a-pick-axe-is-buried-in-his-chest routine.  And there are some silly surreal moments to cherish as well, such as a band of Japanese ninjas disguising themselves as Indians, an absurd ballet dream sequence, and a hilariously heated discussion of musical theory between the trappers and the expedition.  The sheer inventiveness of the whole enterprise makes one wonder what Parker and Co. could have done with a respectable budget and a top notch cast.

It is both a comedic and musical treat that always produces gales of laughter when I play it for folks who have never seen it before.The writers have fairly faithfully presented the story of Alferd Packer as he claimed things happened when he took 5 miners into the mountains and became snowbound during a powerful winter storm. Packer returned as the sole survivor. Further investigation of the remains of his companions indicated they had been gnawed on... By a human!Parker and Stone collaborated on producing this film without much of a budget, while still attending film school at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Many of the locations used in the film were around Boulder. Notable exceptions were the actual court house in Lake City where Packer was tried for cannibalism.The final scene, which has a wonderful song: ""Hang the Bastard"", was shot in Buckskin Joe, a restored ghost town created by fetching buildings from ghost towns around Colorado and relocating them to a location just south of Canon City. Nearly 100 folks took part in the final number, many of whom were university students willing to work for a song, if you'll pardon the pun.This movie is like South Park, but with more bite. It is truly a movie one can sink their teeth into, and satisfy their hunger for campy comedy and hysterical songs scattered throughout the film.I give this film only 5 stars, because that's all they allow!

Keeping in mind that this was Trey Parker's first picture and had a very limited budget, I must say that I believe those criticisms are for the most part exaggerated.  In fact, I think this film is much better than anyone had a right to expect under the circumstances.&quot;Cannibal! the Musical&quot; is the story of the ill-fated journey of Alfred Packer and his party from Utah to Breckenridge Colorado when they became stranded and without food resorted to cannibalism, with Packer being the lone survivor.  Parker plays the title role and the usual suspects-Matt Stone and Dian Bachar-play members of the ill-fated party.  Those who have seen &quot;Orgazmo&quot; may recognize the oriental actor who played &quot;G-Fresh&quot; in that picture in the role of an Indian chief here.  The acting is good, but you won't see any Oscar worthy performances here.  I found the movie to be quite entertaining although somewhat uneven and not quite as funny as &quot;Orgazmo&quot; or &quot;Baseketball&quot;.  The musical numbers are all very good and have very clever lyrics (a strong suit of Parker's).  You'll be singing them to yourself for days afterward.Overall, I think Parker acquits himself well in &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot;.

One day they come to class telling me about this bizarre sounding movie, and I was crying from laughing so hard just from them telling me about it. I knew I had to see it. A friend and I rented it and we have never laughed so hard. This movie literally changed my life. After watching it I knew I wanted to become a filmmaker and I am actually following those dreams. Hopefuly somebody else will be affected the same way I was by this masterpiece. It opens up with this incredibly gory scene of Packer brutally murdering a bunch of men. And it is hilarious. In this one part Packer rips this guys arm off and beats him with it while saying ""Jeepers... Jeepers"". I can't beleive how talented of a filmmaker Trey Parker is. He is the best writer, Director, actor etc. in movie making today. There is nothing that he can't do. No one can come close to Trey.The songs in this movie are even better than the songs in South Park:Bigger... The trapper song is definitley the best. The fur trapper Frenchy is singing what it is like to be trapper ""My pa was an elaphant but thats irrelevant, my ma was an eskimo."" Trey Parker dubs over his voice so it is actually Trey who is singing and the lyrics are so funny you will crying from laughing so hard. That's All I Really Want is a super funny song too. Same with Shpadoinkal ""The sky is blue and all the leaves are green. My heart's as full as baked potato. I think you know precisley what I mean when I say it's a shpadoinkal day. As I ride with my girl, she's my best friend in the whole world..."" Lets Build a Snow Man is hilarious. If you look closely in one scene the snow mans head changes to an aliens head. ""How the hell did he make that tapping noise with his feet. You just now  thought of that. Well it's pretty f@#k$n weird dont you think."" ""He's dead. Well of course he's dead. His brains are all over the snow."" Hang the Bastard is of course hilarious too. You will be singing these songs for months after watching this movie.This is the funniest movie ever made and everybody should buy it to support Trey Parker and Matt Stone.",5,Life changing film!!!,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,2261,"['freshman', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'i', 'had', 'class', 'two', 'sophomores', 'who', 'shall', 'say', 'were', ""n't"", 'most', 'normal', 'people', 'class', 'was', 'so', 'got', 'along', 'great', 'One', 'day', 'come', 'class', 'telling', 'bizarre', 'sounding', 'movie', 'was', 'crying', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'just', 'telling', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'friend', 'rented', 'have', 'never', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'movie', 'literally', 'changed', 'life', 'watching', 'knew', 'wanted', 'become', 'filmmaker', 'am', 'actually', 'following', 'dreams', 'Hopefuly', 'somebody', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'same', 'way', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'up', 'incredibly', 'gory', 'scene', 'Packer', 'brutally', 'murdering', 'bunch', 'men', 'hilarious', 'one', 'part', 'Packer', 'guys', 'arm', 'off', 'saying', 'Jeepers', 'Jeepers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beleive', 'how', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'Trey', 'Parker', 'best', 'writer', 'Director', 'actor', 'etc', 'movie', 'making', 'today', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'No', 'one', 'can', 'come', 'close', 'Trey.The', 'songs', 'movie', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'songs', 'South', 'Park', 'Bigger', 'trapper', 'song', 'definitley', 'best', 'fur', 'trapper', 'Frenchy', 'singing', 'what', 'be', 'pa', 'was', 'elaphant', 'thats', 'irrelevant', 'ma', 'was', 'eskimo', 'Trey', 'Parker', 'voice', 'actually', 'Trey', 'who', 'singing', 'lyrics', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'will', 'crying', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'Really', 'Want', 'super', 'funny', 'song', 'too', 'Same', 'Shpadoinkal', 'sky', 'blue', 'leaves', 'are', 'green', 'heart', 'as', 'full', 'baked', 'potato', 'think', 'know', 'precisley', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'shpadoinkal', 'day', 'ride', 'girl', 'best', 'friend', 'whole', 'world', 'Build', 'Snow', 'Man', 'hilarious', 'look', 'closely', 'one', 'scene', 'snow', 'head', 'changes', 'aliens', 'head', 'How', 'hell', 'did', 'make', 'tapping', 'noise', 'feet', 'just', 'now', 'thought', 'Well', 'pretty', 'f', '@', 'k', 'n', 'weird', 'dont', 'think', 'dead', 'Well', 'course', 'dead', 'brains', 'are', 'snow', 'Bastard', 'course', 'hilarious', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'singing', 'songs', 'months', 'watching', 'movie.This', 'funniest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'everybody', 'should', 'buy', 'support', 'Trey', 'Parker', 'Matt', 'Stone']",N/A

The result is insanely funny.The music is dead-on.  Parker is a damned good commercial composer/musical satirist.  His uncanny ability to nail any style and then accentuate certain aspects and mock that style is featured in this movie, as well as his Southpark series, and most convincingly, in &quot;Southpark: Bigger Longer and Uncut.&quot;  But let me tell you, these songs are really funny.  The Trappers song always has me gasping for air.  &quot;Let's Build a Snowman,&quot; is one of the funniest moments in any movie that I can recall.Several of the scenes in this movie are of the &quot;so funny it hurts&quot; variety.
