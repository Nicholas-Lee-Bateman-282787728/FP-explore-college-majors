1020697,A1622K3BLYEKB5,B000IHYXS0,"Avalon Don ""Avalon Don""","[23, 25]","This is a reunion of Elvis Presley's 1970's band playing live in concert with The King on the big screen singing the vocals.  On this night the old group, orchestra and back-up singers including the 1950's Jordanaires deliver a powerful performance.  The featured musician is guitarist James Burton who is ON.  Collectively they keep right in time which is not an easy task when the singer is not really present.  The 5.1 channel surround sound brings Elvis Presley to the 2000's.  The high point is the moving ballad ""American Trilogy"".  The film clips are taken from his Hawaii concert, Las Vegas shows, ""1968 Comeback Special"" (""If I Can Dream"") and ""On Tour"".  The live audience in Memphis is up for the occasion.  However this DVD is not for everyone.  The camera shots hold on his band only 1 to 3 seconds average time showing them also in the 1970's and this 1997 concert.  Elvis the star gets mixed in between on the big screen at the show and in full format.  The presentation comes off like an MTV video concert.  Being a fan of Elvis since the 1950's, I own numerous Presley live DVD/Videos.  I would rank ""Elvis Lives"" fifth behind in order: ""1968 Comeback Special Deluxe"", ""That's The Way It Is"", ""Aloha Deluxe"" and ""Elvis 56"".  It makes for a good addition for established Presley fans who can handle the quick shot format and younger fans who embrace these type presentations.  ""Elvis Lives"" is a spirited tribute to his last decade not his whole career.  Rockabilly purists would best begin with Presley's 1950's live CD's/DVD's before purchasing this show because the only driving ""Sun"" rocker on this set is the medley ""Mystery Train/Tiger Man"".",4,ELVIS TRIBUTE STARRING HIMSELF,1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,1663,"['reunion', 'Elvis', 'Presley', '1970', 'band', 'playing', 'live', 'concert', 'King', 'big', 'screen', 'singing', 'vocals', 'night', 'old', 'group', 'orchestra', 'back-up', 'singers', 'including', '1950', 'Jordanaires', 'deliver', 'powerful', 'performance', 'featured', 'musician', 'guitarist', 'James', 'Burton', 'who', 'ON', 'Collectively', 'keep', 'right', 'time', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'when', 'singer', 'not', 'really', 'present', '5.1', 'channel', 'surround', 'sound', 'brings', 'Elvis', 'Presley', '2000', 'high', 'point', 'moving', 'ballad', 'American', 'Trilogy', 'film', 'clips', 'are', 'taken', 'Hawaii', 'concert', 'Las', 'Vegas', '1968', 'Comeback', 'Special', 'Can', 'Dream', 'Tour', 'live', 'audience', 'Memphis', 'up', 'occasion', 'However', 'DVD', 'not', 'everyone', 'camera', 'shots', 'hold', 'band', 'only', '1', '3', 'seconds', 'average', 'time', 'showing', 'also', '1970', '1997', 'concert', 'Elvis', 'star', 'mixed', 'big', 'screen', 'show', 'full', 'format', 'presentation', 'off', 'MTV', 'video', 'concert', 'Being', 'fan', 'Elvis', '1950', 'own', 'numerous', 'Presley', 'live', 'DVD/Videos', 'would', 'rank', 'Elvis', 'fifth', 'order', '1968', 'Comeback', 'Special', 'Deluxe', 'Way', 'Aloha', 'Deluxe', 'Elvis', '56', 'good', 'addition', 'established', 'Presley', 'fans', 'who', 'can', 'handle', 'quick', 'shot', 'format', 'younger', 'fans', 'who', 'embrace', 'type', 'presentations', 'Elvis', 'Lives', 'spirited', 'tribute', 'last', 'decade', 'not', 'whole', 'career', 'Rockabilly', 'purists', 'would', 'best', 'begin', 'Presley', '1950', 'live', ""CD's/DVD"", 'purchasing', 'show', 'only', 'driving', 'Sun', 'rocker', 'set', 'medley', 'Mystery', 'Train/Tiger', 'Man']","Elvis Lives: The 25th Anniversary Concert ""Live"" From Memphis"
1020698,A1NADKSHMF3S6K,B000IHYXS0,a viewer,"[3, 3]","If you're not a died-in-the-wool fan or are only going to purchase a few Elvis videos, go for the original performances:  That's the Way It Is (Special Edition), Aloha From Hawaii (Special Edition), Elvis on Tour VHS, The Lost Performances VHS (why aren't these two on DVD??), and The Come-Back Special/One Night With You.  TTWII & Aloha show Elvis at the top and are especially awesome!  The special editions of those include the original releases and extra material and are not to be missed.  The ""Elvis Lives"" DVD reviewed here is a unique supplement, but shouldn't be considered a substitute for the above.This interesting presentation features many of his backup singers and musicians performing live to videos of Elvis from the above performances.  This DVD does include a few new camera angles of Elvis and several songs not on the original releases, but mainly shows that his group was and still is a very talented bunch--much older now.  Notably missing are Charlie Hodge and Kathy Westmoreland--are they with Elvis or still with us?  The DVD also has some interesting commentary.  And, it's nice (I guess) to see that I'm not the only one who has aged over the years!Elvis hasn't--so just view the originals if you're just discovering him.  If you've never seen them, you are in for a treat.This was presented in Memphis as a way to try to recapture the feeling of being at a live Elvis concert, and I suppose succeeds as well as could be hoped.  But there's nothing like the real thing, I guess.  The cutting back and forth is distracting, although this DVD is definitely worth having if you're a fan and already have the originals.  It was good to see the crew.  They had to be fantastic to keep up with Elvis, and were!If I could give the originals 6 or more stars, I'd give this one 5--these are great performances.  Since I can't, it gets 4--but it's good.  I'd forgotten what an awesome job Elvis did on ""How Great Thou Art"" (from the VHS ""Elvis on Tour."")There's never been anyone like Elvis--this DVD wouldn't have been made otherwise!",4,"Back-ups live, Elvis on video--interesting presentation",1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,2053,"[""'re"", 'not', 'died-in-the-wool', 'fan', 'are', 'only', 'going', 'purchase', 'few', 'Elvis', 'videos', 'go', 'original', 'performances', 'Way', 'Is', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Aloha', 'From', 'Hawaii', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Elvis', 'Tour', 'VHS', 'Lost', 'Performances', 'VHS', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'two', 'DVD', 'Come-Back', 'Special/One', 'Night', 'TTWII', 'Aloha', 'show', 'Elvis', 'top', 'are', 'especially', 'awesome', 'special', 'editions', 'include', 'original', 'releases', 'extra', 'material', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Elvis', 'DVD', 'reviewed', 'here', 'unique', 'supplement', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'substitute', 'above.This', 'interesting', 'presentation', 'many', 'backup', 'singers', 'musicians', 'performing', 'live', 'videos', 'Elvis', 'above', 'performances', 'DVD', 'include', 'few', 'new', 'camera', 'angles', 'Elvis', 'several', 'songs', 'not', 'original', 'releases', 'mainly', 'group', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'talented', 'bunch', 'much', 'older', 'now', 'Notably', 'missing', 'are', 'Charlie', 'Hodge', 'Kathy', 'Westmoreland', 'are', 'Elvis', 'still', 'DVD', 'also', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'nice', 'guess', 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'aged', 'years', 'Elvis', ""n't"", 'so', 'just', 'view', 'originals', ""'re"", 'just', 'discovering', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'are', 'treat.This', 'was', 'presented', 'Memphis', 'way', 'try', 'recapture', 'feeling', 'being', 'live', 'Elvis', 'concert', 'suppose', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'hoped', 'nothing', 'real', 'thing', 'guess', 'cutting', 'back', 'forth', 'distracting', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'worth', 'having', ""'re"", 'fan', 'already', 'have', 'originals', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'crew', 'had', 'be', 'fantastic', 'keep', 'up', 'Elvis', 'were', 'could', 'give', 'originals', '6', 'more', 'stars', ""'d"", 'give', 'one', '5', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'ca', ""n't"", '4', 'good', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'what', 'awesome', 'job', 'Elvis', 'did', 'How', 'Great', 'Thou', 'Art', 'VHS', 'Elvis', 'Tour', 'never', 'been', 'anyone', 'Elvis', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'otherwise']","Elvis Lives: The 25th Anniversary Concert ""Live"" From Memphis"

The problem is that on the DVD ...these ""participants"" inject themselves into the broadcast between some of the songs and even during some solos AND WHILE ELVIS IS SINGING!!  for me this completely ruins the vibe and pulls me as the viewer OUT of the experience....(plus the verbiage they are spitting out is on  the monotanous 38 minutes of bonus back slapping). I was looking forward to that bonus footage,  but as the afore mentioned James Burton wasn't included ....failed to excite (although Ronny Tutt was nice  to see and hear from)..I also wonder why the  film of ELVIS from ""That's the Way it Is"" is such poor quality...if you have the DVD you will know its gorgeous footage but it looks terrible in this event and much worse than the TV footage from Hawaii...Elvis completists should love it...and I am not unhappy I own it...I just wish I could have  the experience like being  there at the event and interrupting solos ,Elvis singing with these ""Talking  Heads"" and between songs...JUST PULLS ME OUT of the feel...Joe..NOBODY wants to see you...music directors should be HEARD and not SEEN!",2,50 Stars for Elvis and the Band -48 for the Egos that put it together= 2,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,1558,"['.this', 'hard', 'idea', 'sell', 'full', 'band', 'supporting', 'video', 'long', 'dead', 'singer', 'did', 'did', 'well', 'problem', 'egomaniacs', 'Joe', 'Guercio', 'who', 'was', 'producer', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'sad', 'old', 'face', 'screen', 'What', 'mean', 'concert', 'set', 'up', 'try', 'give', 'feeling', 'actual', 'concert', '..with', 'amazing', 'band', 'led', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Famer', 'James', 'Burton..and', 'absolutely', 'problem', 'DVD', 'participants', 'inject', 'broadcast', 'songs', 'even', 'solos', 'WHILE', 'ELVIS', 'IS', 'SINGING', 'completely', 'vibe', 'pulls', 'viewer', 'OUT', 'experience', 'verbiage', 'are', 'spitting', 'out', 'monotanous', '38', 'minutes', 'bonus', 'back', 'slapping', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'bonus', 'footage', 'afore', 'mentioned', 'James', 'Burton', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', '.failed', 'excite', 'Ronny', 'Tutt', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'hear', '..I', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'film', 'ELVIS', 'Way', 'Is', 'such', 'poor', 'quality', 'have', 'DVD', 'will', 'know', 'gorgeous', 'footage', 'terrible', 'event', 'much', 'worse', 'TV', 'footage', 'Hawaii', 'Elvis', 'completists', 'should', 'love', 'am', 'not', 'unhappy', 'own', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'experience', 'being', 'event', 'interrupting', 'solos', 'Elvis', 'singing', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'songs', 'JUST', 'PULLS', 'ME', 'OUT', 'feel', 'Joe..NOBODY', 'see', 'music', 'directors', 'should', 'be', 'HEARD', 'not', 'SEEN']","Elvis Lives: The 25th Anniversary Concert ""Live"" From Memphis"
