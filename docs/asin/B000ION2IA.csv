Then some pyscho kills off the couple and credits roll. I will say the ladies death is probably the greatest straight to dvd horror kill of all time, i've never seen any better.The basic plot is a girl wants to get married but her family wont let her because she is suppose to marry her cousin. They kill off memebers of the wedding and I must say most the kills do look good. The last half hour was turned into one big comedy but it was funny and I did laugh. The killers are the worst since the horror remake of Prom Night. It's probably the only thing that brings down the movie. However, for three bucks it's a great buy and a great addition to any horror collection.",4,Wedding Slashers,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,806,"['couple', 'running', 'away', 'getting', 'married', 'have', 'car', 'trouble', 'nowehre', 'mechanic', 'place', 'Then', 'pyscho', 'kills', 'couple', 'credits', 'roll', 'will', 'say', 'ladies', 'death', 'probably', 'greatest', 'straight', 'dvd', 'horror', 'kill', 'time', 'i', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'better.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'girl', 'get', 'married', 'family', 'wont', 'let', 'suppose', 'marry', 'cousin', 'kill', 'memebers', 'wedding', 'must', 'say', 'most', 'kills', 'do', 'look', 'good', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'was', 'turned', 'one', 'big', 'comedy', 'was', 'funny', 'did', 'laugh', 'killers', 'are', 'worst', 'horror', 'remake', 'Prom', 'Night', 'probably', 'only', 'thing', 'down', 'movie', 'However', 'three', 'bucks', 'great', 'buy', 'great', 'addition', 'horror', 'collection']",Wedding Slashers

1021818,A18IQME5DCSH2L,B000ION2IA,"Madelyn Pryor ""Goblyn Queen""","[3, 5]","Lately, there has been a shortage of really great B horror movies on the market. Most of the direct to DVD horror has been boring or poorly made. Therefore, I wasn't expecting a lot when I got Wedding Slashers. However, I was pleasantly surpised by one of the BEST B horror movies of all time. Then again, it's not that fair to say best B horror movies, since this is also better than most of what's been in the theater, too.The movie starts off with a bloody double killing in the first six minutes, and the gory thrill ride never lets up from there. All 80 minutes of this movie are packed with brutal murder, fun plot twists, and snappy dialogue. The characters are `real' fleshed out enough that by the end of the film you feel connected to them in a way. The writing and directing are brilliant. I can't say enough nice things about how well this was made on a small budget.The plot, without giving too much away, surrounds the pain and loss one girl, Jenna, has in her life. Death surrounds her, so it's no surprise when her wedding turns into a murderfest. The reason why is the twist, and I don't want to be the one to spoil that for you, the viewer.Look, you can see my other reviews and tell, I'm pretty honest. If a movie sucks, I'll say so. But Wedding Slashers is the surprise smash hit of the year and a must have for anyone who likes horror, especially horror with humor and bite.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS.",5,Best B horror movie in AGES!,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1419,"['Lately', 'been', 'shortage', 'really', 'great', 'B', 'horror', 'movies', 'market', 'Most', 'direct', 'DVD', 'horror', 'been', 'boring', 'poorly', 'made', 'Therefore', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'lot', 'when', 'got', 'Wedding', 'Slashers', 'However', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surpised', 'one', 'BEST', 'B', 'horror', 'movies', 'time', 'Then', 'again', 'not', 'fair', 'say', 'best', 'B', 'horror', 'movies', 'also', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'been', 'theater', 'too.The', 'movie', 'bloody', 'double', 'killing', 'first', 'six', 'minutes', 'gory', 'thrill', 'ride', 'never', 'up', 'there', '80', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'packed', 'brutal', 'murder', 'fun', 'plot', 'twists', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'fleshed', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'feel', 'connected', 'way', 'writing', 'directing', 'are', 'brilliant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'nice', 'things', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'made', 'small', 'budget.The', 'plot', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'pain', 'loss', 'one', 'girl', 'Jenna', 'life', 'Death', 'surprise', 'when', 'wedding', 'murderfest', 'reason', 'why', 'twist', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'one', 'spoil', 'viewer.Look', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'tell', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'honest', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'say', 'so', 'Wedding', 'Slashers', 'surprise', 'smash', 'hit', 'year', 'must', 'have', 'anyone', 'who', 'horror', 'especially', 'horror', 'humor', 'bite.HIGHEST', 'RECOMMENDATIONS']",Wedding Slashers

The tale of a young woman whose boyfriends end up dying horrible deaths at the hands of her multiply inbred family is ridiculously scripted and the acting is non-existent.  The only ""name"" actor in the cast is Richard Lynch, who doesn't come in until close to the end as the potential bride's father.  The movie treats its killings sadistically and there are characters in the movie who we never know who they are.  A really bad and not one of those cheesy bad movies.

1021821,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B000ION2IA,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","This film could have been titled ""Kentucky Chainsaw Massacre."" The film opens up 40 years ago with a couple eloping to Las Vegas. Along the way the car he just spent his last dime on, breaks down. The mechanic claims, ""it was tampered with"" a key plot point. Needless to say the couple doesn't make it. We jump to five years ago with Jenna (Jessica Kinney) eloping with her boyfriend. They don't make it. During some counseling with a creepy looking priest shrink, Jenna reveals she comes from an over protective family as Scooby-Doo puts the pieces together. She is now engaged to Alex (Ross Kelly) with her family on the way...This is a substandard 80's style slasher film. It has plenty of blood, gore and severed body parts, it just doesn't do it well. It has given us quantity and sacrificed quality. There is some minor camp value to the film as the acting is noticeably bad and one camera shot had something on the lens in the upper right corner. Minor humor. For 80's slasher fans it might be worth a peek if the film was cheap enough.

1021822,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000ION2IA,trebe,"[0, 0]","About the only thing that Wedding Slashers (2006) has going for it, is a propensity for gore, particularly violence directed at the head.  The special effects aren't exactly outstanding, and after a while, the unconvincingly executed decapitations, and other acts of violence, aren't enough to hold your attention.The muddled story involving a woman named Jenna (Jessica Kinney), and her homicidal family, isn't presented in a very coherent way, and fails to make a solid emotional connection.  Apparently intended as a horror/comedy, the comedic elements are mostly a miss, as the characters mostly come off as idiots, who head directly into the path of danger.  The writing and dialog, lacks any cleverness, and the acting is subpar even for a low budget horror film.  Despite a substantial amount of gore, Wedding Slashers is more annoying than scary.
