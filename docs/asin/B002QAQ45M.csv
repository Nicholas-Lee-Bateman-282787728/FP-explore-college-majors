Their need for that kinship--or assimilation--is what drives the story and, once their self-created worlds are ruthlessly stolen from them by invaders, they seem to need to find each other to survive. This is beautifully written and well acted and one of the best films I've seen this year. My only question was why they were communicating to each other in English. Is that how one tries to communicate to the outside world in any country now?",5,Brilliant and Entertaining Meditation on Isolation in modern society,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,688,"['two', 'characters', 'maybe', 'really', 'representing', 'one', 'character', 'needing', 'assimilation', 'find', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'midst', 'what', 'perceive', 'brutal', 'outside', 'create', 'means', 'survival', 'find', 'sense', 'kinship', 'other', 'need', 'kinship', 'assimilation', 'what', 'story', 'once', 'self-created', 'worlds', 'are', 'ruthlessly', 'stolen', 'invaders', 'seem', 'need', 'find', 'other', 'survive', 'beautifully', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'My', 'only', 'question', 'was', 'why', 'were', 'communicating', 'other', 'English', 'how', 'one', 'communicate', 'outside', 'world', 'country', 'now']",Castaway on the Moon (Standard Edition) DVD

I've often spotted little islands in the middle of rivers and daydreamed about what it would be like to live there.  Apparently I'm not the only one!  This is such a clever and original film.  The humor is so outrageous in spots (the protagonist's suicide attempt is thwarted by an attack of diarrhea), but then it picks up on the most delicate points of all that is good in the world (as he squats, he spots an exquisitely tasty plant he hadn't eaten in years).I kept expecting the movie to go bad, but it is excellent from beginning to end.  And no, you don't have to be Korean to understand it (I think you'd enjoy it and get it even if you didn't read the subtitles).  Yes, some elements are specific to Korean culture, but the emotions are wonderfully universal.I rarely give movies five stars, but Castaway on the Moon definitely deserves it.",5,Surprisingly excellent!,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,987,"['enjoy', 'foreign', 'films', ""'m"", 'American', 'premise', 'movie', 'being', 'stranded', 'middle', 'civilization', 'sounded', 'so', 'intriguing', ""'ve"", 'often', 'spotted', 'little', 'islands', 'middle', 'rivers', 'daydreamed', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'live', 'there', 'Apparently', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'such', 'clever', 'original', 'film', 'humor', 'so', 'outrageous', 'spots', 'protagonist', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'thwarted', 'attack', 'diarrhea', 'then', 'up', 'most', 'delicate', 'points', 'good', 'world', 'spots', 'exquisitely', 'tasty', 'plant', 'had', ""n't"", 'eaten', 'years', '.I', 'kept', 'expecting', 'movie', 'go', 'bad', 'excellent', 'beginning', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Korean', 'understand', 'think', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'get', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'subtitles', 'Yes', 'elements', 'are', 'specific', 'Korean', 'culture', 'emotions', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'universal.I', 'rarely', 'give', 'movies', 'five', 'stars', 'Castaway', 'Moon', 'definitely']",Castaway on the Moon (Standard Edition) DVD
1283749,A313H6238N589,B002QAQ45M,"Jaewoo Kim ""OB-Wan""","[25, 25]","I enjoyed this film and so would most others.The movie is meant to be a critical commentary on the modern Korean society. Much of the humor is subtle and requires an intimate understanding of the Korean society to fully understand it.The main male character is a very average Korean male. He is always harped-on because he doesn't excel in anything. He went to an average university, works at an average job, and now finds himself entering middle-age with heavy debt and his future now looks fairly bleak. His girlfriend dumps him. He decides to kill himself by jumping off a bridge and that's when his adventure begins.The main female character suffers from an acute social anxiety disorder and refuses contact with the outside world, even with her family. She lives in a room of her parents' house and texts them whenever she needs something. She never opens her doors (she locks them) except when she needs to wash and use the bathroom.Based on the above, you can see where this story is going.The female character is played beautifully by Jung Ryo Won. It isn't an easy character to play. But she comes off not as a crazy nut, but as a deeply vulnerable character who goes to the extreme to shelter herself from the strains of the world. I was very convinced of her character and I was impressed with Jung Ryo Won's acting ability.I felt the director and the writers could have left few nauseous scene out. There is a scene when the male character licks his body for salt and even gathers his sweat for salt flavoring (ewwww). That imagery almost ruined the movie for me.Here are the subtleties you may have missed if you are non-Korean:1)The noodle in the movie is called JaJangMyun. Its delivery is like pizza-delivery in the US and the Koreans consume hundreds of millions of that dish every year (it is quite delicious). The JaJangMyun delivery man is often obsessed with getting the plastic bowl back and nothing pisses him off more than not getting that bowl back (most delivery service now deliver in a disposable bowl). I won't ruin it here by explaining why that's relevant, but that fact comes into play in the funniest scene of the movie.2)The two main characters communicate in English. In one scene, the male character says in English, ""You are Korean, I am Korean, and we speak in English..."" This is meant to be a criticism of modern Korea, which is so obsessed with learning English that people often talk to each other in English to improve their skill. The two characters only communicate in English until the very end.3)The air-attack drill scenes are indeed enforced twice a year to prepare for possible North Korean attack. The movie states they are done twice a year but never explains why the Koreans do the drill.",5,Movie commentary on modern Korea; could have left some parts out,1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,2741,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'so', 'would', 'most', 'others.The', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'critical', 'commentary', 'modern', 'Korean', 'society', 'Much', 'humor', 'subtle', 'intimate', 'understanding', 'Korean', 'society', 'fully', 'understand', 'it.The', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'very', 'average', 'Korean', 'male', 'always', 'harped-on', ""n't"", 'excel', 'anything', 'went', 'average', 'university', 'average', 'job', 'now', 'entering', 'middle-age', 'heavy', 'debt', 'future', 'now', 'fairly', 'bleak', 'girlfriend', 'kill', 'jumping', 'off', 'bridge', 'when', 'adventure', 'begins.The', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'suffers', 'acute', 'social', 'anxiety', 'disorder', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'even', 'family', 'room', 'parents', 'house', 'texts', 'whenever', 'something', 'never', 'doors', 'when', 'wash', 'use', 'bathroom.Based', 'above', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'story', 'going.The', 'female', 'character', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Jung', 'Ryo', 'Won', ""n't"", 'easy', 'character', 'play', 'off', 'not', 'crazy', 'nut', 'deeply', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'who', 'extreme', 'shelter', 'strains', 'world', 'was', 'very', 'convinced', 'character', 'was', 'impressed', 'Jung', 'Ryo', 'Won', 'acting', 'ability.I', 'felt', 'director', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'few', 'nauseous', 'scene', 'out', 'scene', 'when', 'male', 'character', 'body', 'salt', 'even', 'gathers', 'sweat', 'salt', 'flavoring', 'ewwww', 'almost', 'ruined', 'movie', 'me.Here', 'are', 'subtleties', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'are', 'non-Korean:1', 'noodle', 'movie', 'called', 'JaJangMyun', 'delivery', 'pizza-delivery', 'US', 'Koreans', 'consume', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dish', 'year', 'quite', 'delicious', 'JaJangMyun', 'delivery', 'man', 'often', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'plastic', 'bowl', 'back', 'nothing', 'pisses', 'off', 'more', 'not', 'getting', 'bowl', 'back', 'most', 'delivery', 'service', 'now', 'disposable', 'bowl', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'here', 'explaining', 'why', 'relevant', 'fact', 'play', 'funniest', 'scene', 'movie.2', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'communicate', 'English', 'one', 'scene', 'male', 'character', 'English', 'are', 'Korean', 'am', 'Korean', 'speak', 'English', 'meant', 'be', 'criticism', 'modern', 'Korea', 'so', 'obsessed', 'learning', 'English', 'people', 'often', 'talk', 'other', 'English', 'improve', 'skill', 'two', 'characters', 'only', 'communicate', 'English', 'very', 'end.3', 'air-attack', 'drill', 'scenes', 'are', 'indeed', 'enforced', 'twice', 'year', 'prepare', 'possible', 'North', 'Korean', 'attack', 'movie', 'are', 'done', 'twice', 'year', 'never', 'why', 'Koreans', 'do', 'drill']",Castaway on the Moon (Standard Edition) DVD
1283750,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B002QAQ45M,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[6, 6]","Castaway on the Moon is a fantastic film about a suicidal man that ends up stranded on an island (on the Han River) after a failed suicide attempt; while being watched by a young escapist women that hasn't left her home/room in 3 years. They develop their relationship through messages written on a sandy shore and message-in-a-bottle style. The movie works very well as a comedy, drama and romantic film. It all blends together to create an amazing experience. I particularly found the young woman's story to be very touching and interesting as she explains her escapist/lonely lifestyle. It's also amazing to see how these characters develop over time. Kim Seung-Keun, the stranded man, has no idea how to survive in the beginning. But, he eventually gives up and accepts his new life, throws away his materialistic lifestyle- he even uses his credit cards to scrape bird poop!This film can make you smile, laugh, and even cry. It's not an action or survival film, but it is relatable. The ending was fantastic and keeps pulling at your emotions, the music was great, the acting was brilliant, and the subject is beautiful and deep. I highly recommend Castaway on the Moon. As of 8/18/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.This film does not have any significant violence, but it does have two suicide attempts (not graphic), and it has some brief nudity.

1283751,A2IYRRHZMF49L1,B002QAQ45M,J  Tate,"[2, 2]","I would buy this movie in a heartbeat if it were available on DVD here in the States. Most people who live in or have lived in an urban setting could relate at least somewhat to the characters in this movie and their feelings of alienation and being ovewhelmed by modern society and it's multitude of complexities. A young Korean man, who owes a lot of debt, tries to commit suicide by jumping from a bridge on the Han river in Seoul Korea but he ends up not dying but being washed up on an inescapable island in the river. He can see the city from the island but there is no way off. A girl with strong Hikikimori tendencies eventually spots him from her highrise, window telescope but she is so socially withdrawn that the only way she can bring herself to contact the man is with written messages thrown onto the island in bottles from the bridge the guy initially jumped off of. What happens from there forms the gist of the story. It has some amusing moments and some very poignant, touching moments. It's a heartwarming tale. It's somewhat similar to the Tom Hanks movie Castaway but still different enough to warrant watching.  By the time it ended I wanted to watch a sequel (there isn't one) to see what happened next in these people's lives that's how emotionally invested I became in the characters. I love Korean movies but I find most Korean films seem to have rather dark endings as though fate always leans towards suffering but not so in this delightful movie.

Little dialogue, good acting, well-shot scenes and cinematography tell a story that I've never seen told before in movies. In this day and age of the internet and of human identities formed by consumerism we may very well have an inkling of what issues and emotions the two main characters are going through. I will say that when the main character finally gets to enjoy a satisfying meal(not giving away details) I did not expect his reaction, but I was thoroughly gratified by that scene.
