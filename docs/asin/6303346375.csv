370203,A2TLEB18074L4S,6303346375,Alexander Leach,"[3, 3]","No need to say much about the film itself: it is superb as others have agreed, with a phenomenally compelling performance from Sir Alec Guinness, with Sir John Mills (who won Best Actor prize at the 1960 Venice Film Festival) and the rest of the cast giving great support.The Criterion DVD offers a really fine transfer: colours are rich, and there is a total absence of any artefacts, nicks or blemishes in the print.  Sharpness is also very good, there is a hint of occasional grain but this is in the original celluloid I think - and anyway is nothing to worry about.One slight caveat which has been commented upon by various review sites (so is not just a flaw in my DVD copy) is near the end of the film the appearance on the transfer of an opaque vertical line close to the right edge of the image, about a centimetre wide on my 28&quot; screen.  This is not really as distracting as it sounds and was presumably unfixable by Criterion from the source print.  It starts near the end of the snooker room scene and stays for about 5 minutes - disappearing during Guinness's tour-de-force final scene where he addresses the assembled officers in a bravura display of fine acting - which leads to the unforgettable (and very moving) climax of the film.  Certainly no-one should be put off by this slight flaw as it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the film.Soundwise this film offers a straight mono track - which with a 5 channel set-up will unusually use only the centre speaker.  Manually adjusting my amp I was able to switch to the two fronts (minus the centre) which gives a slightly wider soundstage.  In any event the dialogue is clear (subtitles will help with some of the more inpenetrable lines) and Malcolm Arnold'd bagpipe-based score comes through well.The extras are slight but OK: the audio-only interview with the aged John Mills in 2002 is not too revealing but he is a lovely man, as comes across well here.  The filmed interview with Guinness is better but covers his whole career rather than this film - and he doesn't give too much away of the real man.  The trailer is interesting - because it is so appallingly (and hilariously) bad, with a dreadful voiceover and bizarre captions.Get this DVD for the fine transfer of a brilliant film, which at the end of the day is the prime reason for any DVD package.",5,Fine DVD for a Guinness classic,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,2336,"['need', 'say', 'much', 'film', 'superb', 'others', 'have', 'agreed', 'phenomenally', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Sir', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Sir', 'John', 'Mills', 'who', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'prize', '1960', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'rest', 'cast', 'giving', 'great', 'support.The', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'really', 'fine', 'transfer', 'colours', 'are', 'rich', 'total', 'absence', 'artefacts', 'nicks', 'blemishes', 'print', 'Sharpness', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'hint', 'occasional', 'grain', 'original', 'celluloid', 'think', 'anyway', 'nothing', 'worry', 'about.One', 'slight', 'caveat', 'been', 'commented', 'various', 'review', 'sites', 'so', 'not', 'just', 'flaw', 'DVD', 'copy', 'end', 'film', 'appearance', 'transfer', 'opaque', 'vertical', 'line', 'close', 'right', 'edge', 'image', 'centimetre', 'wide', '28', 'quot', 'screen', 'not', 'really', 'as', 'distracting', 'was', 'presumably', 'unfixable', 'Criterion', 'source', 'print', 'end', 'snooker', 'room', 'scene', 'stays', '5', 'minutes', 'disappearing', 'Guinness', 'tour-de-force', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'assembled', 'officers', 'bravura', 'display', 'fine', 'acting', 'unforgettable', 'very', 'moving', 'climax', 'film', 'Certainly', 'no-one', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'slight', 'flaw', 'did', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'enjoyment', 'film.Soundwise', 'film', 'straight', 'mono', 'track', '5', 'channel', 'set-up', 'will', 'unusually', 'use', 'only', 'centre', 'speaker', 'Manually', 'adjusting', 'amp', 'was', 'able', 'switch', 'two', 'fronts', 'centre', 'slightly', 'wider', 'soundstage', 'event', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'subtitles', 'will', 'help', 'more', 'inpenetrable', 'lines', 'Malcolm', 'Arnold', 'bagpipe-based', 'score', 'well.The', 'extras', 'are', 'slight', 'OK', 'audio-only', 'interview', 'aged', 'John', 'Mills', '2002', 'not', 'too', 'revealing', 'lovely', 'man', 'across', 'well', 'here', 'filmed', 'interview', 'Guinness', 'better', 'whole', 'career', 'rather', 'film', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'real', 'man', 'trailer', 'interesting', 'so', 'appallingly', 'hilariously', 'bad', 'dreadful', 'voiceover', 'bizarre', 'captions.Get', 'DVD', 'fine', 'transfer', 'brilliant', 'film', 'end', 'day', 'prime', 'reason', 'DVD', 'package']",Tunes of Glory VHS
370204,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6303346375,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 2/14Rate: 92/14: Tunes of Glory is a complicated British picture about the battle of personalities between two leaders in the Scottish Highland Regiment. One is the merry easygoing in a boys' club way, and the other is the martinet with emphasis on martial punctiliousness. The psychological game unfolds in terms of feelings, reactions, and adherence to routines. Over the long run, the easygoing leader outlasts the other, forcing me not to agree with his ways and finding them characteristically un-militaristic. Of course, he pays for it because he is overcome with guilt and shame. I think the movie ended a bit early, so it drags out too long for me. The film will probably get a `10' from me the next time I see it. Meanwhile, Tunes of Glory is a wonderful film with superlative acting performances by the cast, resplendent cinematography, and adroit screenplay. Alec Guinness shows why he was an outstanding actor of his time, and John Mills is equally at his level too. On a side note, many of the actors in the film are quite familiar because they were in The Great Escape and The Bridge on the River Kwai.

Not only was I treated to an amazing drama, but also to the brilliance of Sir Alec Guinness and John Mills. Alec Guinness was one of our finest actors, and in Tunes of Glory, he is without peer. His portrayal of the whiskey-loving and irascable Jock Sinclair is one of the highlights of his estimable career. John Mills, who plays his antithesis, is equally memorable as the replacement colonel whose by-the-book leadership sets the stage for a clash of wills that is mesmerizing to watch.Mills plays his role so well his frustration with Guinness's Sinclair is almost palpable. At times, Colonel Barrows's head almost explodes in apoplectic fits. Sinclair's heavy-drinking and jocular exploits is too much for the straight-laced Barrows, and the confrontation between these two large egos can only end in tragedy.A great examination of military ritual and tradition, and a fine example of superb acting.

Colonel Jock Sinclair (Alec Guinness) was named acting commander of his regimental battalion and now expects to be confirmed. He's an up-from-the-ranks officer, hard drinking, bluff but sly, whose whole life as been the regiment. He demands loyalty and manliness in his officers. But he isn't confirmed. Coming to replace him as battalion commander is Colonel Basil Barrow (John Mills). He's everything Sinclair dislikes, aristocratic, privileged, from a military family. He also is something of martinet, a man who prizes decorum in his officers, a man who was a prisoner of war and returned shaken. Something of a weak man.The stage is set for Barrow to try to take moral command of the batallion, and for Sinclair to undermine him every step of the way. The result is that both men, with their own weaknesses, destroy themselves.A number of elements makes this, in my opinion, a powerful motion picture. The setting is batallion headquarters in Scotland, located in a towering, massive stone hulk of a building that reeks of tradition. It's winter and it's cold, and it's a perfect setting for the struggles going on. The customs of the regiment, the playing of pipes, all underline the closed-in atmosphere of this all-male society. The cast is excellent, from the actors playing the soldiers to the NCOs to the officers. Dennis Price, a first-class actor, is cool and enigmatic as the battalion's exec who may have to pick up the pieces and who may not be so disinterested as he appears. And Guinness and Mills are extraordinary, with both playing against type. While Guinness has the flashier role, Mills brings such depth of well-intentioned weakness that the match is equal between the two. You wind up understanding both men and having sympathy for both. Most of all, I think, is the story. It is a fascinating look inside a regiment, tied to a story of real power and tragedy as these two men ruin their lives. This is great story telling and great acting. I recommend the movie.The Criterion disc is first rate. Among other extras, it features an excellent interview with the director, Ronald Neame, in which he describes the filming of the movie.",5,"An Excellent Movie, With Guinness and Mills",1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,2269,"['sad', 'great', 'superbly', 'acted', 'movie', 'struggle', 'dominance', 'Scottish', 'regiment', 'WWII', 'Colonel', 'Jock', 'Sinclair', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'was', 'named', 'acting', 'commander', 'regimental', 'battalion', 'now', 'be', 'confirmed', 'up-from-the-ranks', 'officer', 'hard', 'drinking', 'bluff', 'sly', 'whole', 'life', 'been', 'regiment', 'loyalty', 'manliness', 'officers', ""n't"", 'confirmed', 'Coming', 'replace', 'battalion', 'commander', 'Colonel', 'Basil', 'Barrow', 'John', 'Mills', 'everything', 'Sinclair', 'dislikes', 'aristocratic', 'privileged', 'military', 'family', 'also', 'something', 'martinet', 'man', 'who', 'decorum', 'officers', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'prisoner', 'war', 'returned', 'shaken', 'Something', 'weak', 'man.The', 'stage', 'set', 'Barrow', 'try', 'take', 'moral', 'command', 'batallion', 'Sinclair', 'undermine', 'step', 'way', 'result', 'men', 'own', 'weaknesses', 'destroy', 'themselves.A', 'number', 'elements', 'opinion', 'powerful', 'motion', 'picture', 'setting', 'batallion', 'headquarters', 'Scotland', 'located', 'towering', 'massive', 'stone', 'hulk', 'building', 'reeks', 'tradition', 'winter', 'cold', 'perfect', 'setting', 'struggles', 'going', 'customs', 'regiment', 'playing', 'pipes', 'underline', 'closed-in', 'atmosphere', 'all-male', 'society', 'cast', 'excellent', 'actors', 'playing', 'soldiers', 'NCOs', 'officers', 'Dennis', 'Price', 'first-class', 'actor', 'cool', 'enigmatic', 'battalion', 'exec', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'disinterested', 'Guinness', 'Mills', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'playing', 'type', 'Guinness', 'flashier', 'role', 'Mills', 'such', 'depth', 'well-intentioned', 'weakness', 'match', 'equal', 'two', 'wind', 'up', 'understanding', 'men', 'having', 'sympathy', 'Most', 'think', 'story', 'fascinating', 'look', 'regiment', 'tied', 'story', 'real', 'power', 'tragedy', 'two', 'men', 'ruin', 'lives', 'great', 'story', 'telling', 'great', 'acting', 'recommend', 'movie.The', 'Criterion', 'disc', 'first', 'rate', 'other', 'extras', 'excellent', 'interview', 'director', 'Ronald', 'Neame', 'filming', 'movie']",Tunes of Glory VHS

Face it, a lot of people's awareness of Guinness came from Star Wars.  And that is a shame.  He was a brilliant actor with a touch of comedic genius, and he shines in this battle of wits and wills with Mills, another great.It's basically a two man film, though there is a fine supporting cast of John Fraser, Dennis Price, Susannah York, Gordon Jackson, Percy Herbert and Peter McEnery.Guinness is Major Jock Sinclair who has been with this Highland regiment since he joined as a boy piper, and rose to Second-in-Command during war time.  The unit is now back in Scotland during peace time.  Had he stayed as second-in-command, it might now have set tone for the conflict with Lt. Col. Basil Barrow (John Mills).  But Jock has been Acting-Commander, so he fully expected to be promoted to full command.  The men love him, he's a real man's man.  He is devastated, a blow to his ego, when they bring in Barrow to assume command.Barrow is not a very likable character, a martinet, so it's easy for Jock to wage psychological warfare by undermining Barrow at every turn.  A Sandhurst trained disciplinarian, Barrows quickly alienates everyone with his prissy by the book ways, giving Jock the power to slowly rot Barrows authority, ultimately shaking Barrows mental foundations.While Jock is doing all he can to send Barrows into a tissy fit, Jock's daughter is slipping around meeting John Fraser, which is pushing Jock to the edge as well.There is a coming confrontation and only one man will survive.This is acting at is best, and this film really should get more attention.",5,a tour de force of acting!,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,1703,"['Alec', 'Guinness', 'John', 'Mills', 'two', 'best', 'actors', 'decades', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'either', 'really', 'received', 'full', 'dues', 'Face', 'lot', 'people', 'awareness', 'Guinness', 'came', 'Star', 'Wars', 'shame', 'was', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'touch', 'comedic', 'genius', 'battle', 'wits', 'wills', 'Mills', 'great.It', 'basically', 'two', 'man', 'film', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'John', 'Fraser', 'Dennis', 'Price', 'Susannah', 'York', 'Gordon', 'Jackson', 'Percy', 'Herbert', 'Peter', 'McEnery.Guinness', 'Major', 'Jock', 'Sinclair', 'who', 'been', 'Highland', 'regiment', 'joined', 'boy', 'piper', 'rose', 'Second-in-Command', 'war', 'time', 'unit', 'now', 'back', 'Scotland', 'peace', 'time', 'Had', 'stayed', 'second-in-command', 'might', 'now', 'have', 'set', 'tone', 'conflict', 'Lt.', 'Col', 'Basil', 'Barrow', 'John', 'Mills', 'Jock', 'been', 'Acting-Commander', 'fully', 'expected', 'be', 'promoted', 'full', 'command', 'men', 'love', 'real', 'man', 'man', 'devastated', 'blow', 'ego', 'when', 'bring', 'Barrow', 'assume', 'command.Barrow', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'martinet', 'easy', 'Jock', 'wage', 'psychological', 'warfare', 'undermining', 'Barrow', 'turn', 'Sandhurst', 'trained', 'disciplinarian', 'Barrows', 'quickly', 'everyone', 'prissy', 'book', 'ways', 'giving', 'Jock', 'power', 'slowly', 'rot', 'Barrows', 'authority', 'ultimately', 'shaking', 'Barrows', 'mental', 'foundations.While', 'Jock', 'doing', 'can', 'send', 'Barrows', 'tissy', 'fit', 'Jock', 'daughter', 'slipping', 'around', 'meeting', 'John', 'Fraser', 'pushing', 'Jock', 'edge', 'well.There', 'coming', 'confrontation', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'will', 'survive.This', 'acting', 'best', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'get', 'more', 'attention']",Tunes of Glory VHS

Alec Guinness in the persona of Major Jock Sinclair represents the former, and John Mills represents the latter in role of Lt. Colonel Basil Barrow, who is sent to replace Sinclair as permanent Colonel of a Scottish battalion. Sinclair is a popular former (bag-) Pipe Major who has risen up through the ranks because of his heroism in the desert campaign of El Alamein in World War II.  Barrow, whom Jock belittles, calling him ""Barrow Boy"" [street vendor], is the antithesis: a graduate of Eton and Oxford, he is descended from a long line of colonels who have themselves commanded the battalion.  Barrow has therefore inherited the ""Idea"" of the regiment, while Sinclair has grown up at its heart and has grafted himself onto what he considers its spirit.I cannot recall two other actors who are so well matched in equality of strength. One gets the feeling that if any other actor had been cast in only one of the respective leading roles, either Guinness or Mills would have dominated that unfortunate actor. But these two giants are equipollent in ability. Furthermore, they have a history of acting together. Guinness was outstanding as Herbert Pocket (his first role) in Dickens' ""Great Expectations"" where he played alongside of John Mills, who portrayed Pip. In ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" Guinness also worked with Dennis Price who, in ""Tunes"", plays Major Charles Scott, whose motives are as enigmatic as he is aristocratic. Jock never tires of addressing him mockingly as ""Old Boy!"" And although Charlie seems to tolerate Jock's japes good-naturedly to a point, when the tension between Jock Sinclair and Basil Barrow explodes, Charlie's motives become ambiguously opaque.The excellent ensemble cast includes Kay Walsh as Jock's actress and ""bit on the side"" and Gordon Jackson (of Upstairs-Downstairs fame) as Captain Jimmy Cairns, the only man who really tries to understand the difficulties of both antagonists; and the incomparable Duncan Macrae as the sympathetic Pipe Major MacLean.Ronald Neame's direction is superb, and the disc includes a fascinating interview with him about the making of the film and his warm relationship with the actors. The cinematography captures the essence (or what convinced me was the essence, since I have no personal knowledge thereof) of the officers' quarters: gothic elegance downstairs--the great fireplace and tall leaded windows; the paneled dining hall with its regimental silver; and Spartan rudiments upstairs in the sleeping quarters. The dour grey skies and the powdering of snow outside seem to exacerbate the tensions and jealousies inside that not even the crackling fire in the immense grate can dispel.A star of the film is certainly the piping and the precision marching of the splendidly kilted highland pipers, who pipe all the tunes of glory that accompany the cinematic narrative, and fully epitomize the ""Idea"" of the Regiment.",5,Collision Course,1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,3014,"['Tunes', 'Glory', 'story', 'what', 'when', 'proverbial', 'irresistible', 'force', 'immovable', 'object', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'persona', 'Major', 'Jock', 'Sinclair', 'former', 'John', 'Mills', 'latter', 'role', 'Lt', 'Colonel', 'Basil', 'Barrow', 'who', 'sent', 'replace', 'Sinclair', 'permanent', 'Colonel', 'Scottish', 'battalion', 'Sinclair', 'popular', 'former', 'bag-', 'Pipe', 'Major', 'who', 'risen', 'up', 'ranks', 'heroism', 'desert', 'campaign', 'El', 'Alamein', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Barrow', 'whom', 'Jock', 'belittles', 'calling', 'Barrow', 'Boy', '[', 'street', 'vendor', ']', 'antithesis', 'graduate', 'Eton', 'Oxford', 'descended', 'long', 'line', 'colonels', 'who', 'have', 'commanded', 'battalion', 'Barrow', 'therefore', 'inherited', 'Idea', 'regiment', 'Sinclair', 'grown', 'up', 'heart', 'grafted', 'what', 'spirit.I', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'two', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'matched', 'equality', 'strength', 'One', 'feeling', 'other', 'actor', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'only', 'one', 'respective', 'leading', 'roles', 'either', 'Guinness', 'Mills', 'would', 'have', 'dominated', 'unfortunate', 'actor', 'two', 'giants', 'are', 'equipollent', 'ability', 'Furthermore', 'have', 'history', 'acting', 'together', 'Guinness', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Herbert', 'Pocket', 'first', 'role', 'Dickens', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'where', 'played', 'alongside', 'John', 'Mills', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Pip', 'Kind', 'Hearts', 'Coronets', 'Guinness', 'also', 'worked', 'Dennis', 'Price', 'who', 'Tunes', 'Major', 'Charles', 'Scott', 'motives', 'are', 'as', 'enigmatic', 'aristocratic', 'Jock', 'never', 'addressing', 'mockingly', 'Old', 'Boy', 'Charlie', 'tolerate', 'Jock', 'japes', 'good-naturedly', 'point', 'when', 'tension', 'Jock', 'Sinclair', 'Basil', 'Barrow', 'Charlie', 'motives', 'become', 'ambiguously', 'opaque.The', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Kay', 'Walsh', 'Jock', 'actress', 'bit', 'side', 'Gordon', 'Jackson', 'Upstairs-Downstairs', 'fame', 'Captain', 'Jimmy', 'Cairns', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'understand', 'difficulties', 'antagonists', 'incomparable', 'Duncan', 'Macrae', 'sympathetic', 'Pipe', 'Major', 'MacLean.Ronald', 'Neame', 'direction', 'superb', 'disc', 'fascinating', 'interview', 'making', 'film', 'warm', 'relationship', 'actors', 'cinematography', 'essence', 'what', 'convinced', 'was', 'essence', 'have', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'thereof', 'officers', 'quarters', 'gothic', 'elegance', 'downstairs', 'great', 'fireplace', 'tall', 'leaded', 'windows', 'paneled', 'dining', 'hall', 'regimental', 'silver', 'Spartan', 'rudiments', 'sleeping', 'quarters', 'dour', 'grey', 'skies', 'powdering', 'snow', 'outside', 'seem', 'exacerbate', 'tensions', 'jealousies', 'not', 'even', 'crackling', 'fire', 'immense', 'grate', 'can', 'dispel.A', 'star', 'film', 'certainly', 'piping', 'precision', 'marching', 'splendidly', 'kilted', 'highland', 'pipers', 'who', 'pipe', 'tunes', 'glory', 'cinematic', 'narrative', 'fully', 'epitomize', 'Idea', 'Regiment']",Tunes of Glory VHS
370211,A16CZRQL23NOIW,6303346375,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[2, 5]","This smart film shows us one true tour de force between John Mills and Alec Guiness. Besides all the technical aspects that support this work, the dramatic nucleus deserves be remarked.Yet this film was made in 1960 ; this script turns around one the essentials lines that support the question about what an effective leader must be.Look inside what Guiness means; he has set up his mood leadership in a crowd of soldiers accostumed to his irreverent behavior. He shares what they like; he drinks and he's vulgar too; in other words he flies with them , even ridiculizes the essential role of the authority (UBUNTU leader, in other words). This a style yet employed for many managements specially in organizations composed by people of medium professional rank ; this leader stans up about the warm scent of the charisma; that behavior lets to Guiness smell and know the hidden weakness of every man under his power.This approach is suddenly disturbed when an officer (John Mills) comes for him to replace. Obviously; that fact generates an inmediat reaction state in all the officers.

The script is very carefully made ; just remember just two years before Stanley Kubrick had filmed Paths of Glory. This is important due the bitter atmosphere about every item related with the authority excess was not accepted in any society status.Add to this, the Korea Cold War from the fifties ; the russian invassion over Hungary ; the growing nuclear tension around the nuclear weapons and the visible increase of peace movements all around the world in multiple facets as Litherature; poetry ; painting (Jason Pollock) ; music (rock & roll); cinema (New Wave birth) and challenging films as Baby doll, On the waterfront or Anatomy of a crime ; the raising movements for protecting the nature ; at this decade (fifties) the society was opened for new discoveries and sensations search (remember that the pill was discovered in the middle of the fifties) ; and this mood made the loss of certain principles you assumed as permanent.And this movie walks in that direction. Watch this one; because its values and intentions goes far beyond a mere entertainment , the movie inquires you ; it challenges you and invites you to react.Another superb achievement.",5,An astonishing movie worthy leadership lesson!,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,2636,"['smart', 'film', 'one', 'true', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'John', 'Mills', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'technical', 'aspects', 'support', 'work', 'dramatic', 'nucleus', 'deserves', 'be', 'remarked.Yet', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1960', 'script', 'one', 'essentials', 'lines', 'support', 'question', 'what', 'effective', 'leader', 'must', 'be.Look', 'what', 'Guiness', 'set', 'up', 'mood', 'leadership', 'crowd', 'soldiers', 'accostumed', 'irreverent', 'behavior', 'shares', 'what', 'like', 'vulgar', 'too', 'other', 'words', 'even', 'essential', 'role', 'authority', 'UBUNTU', 'leader', 'other', 'words', 'style', 'yet', 'employed', 'many', 'managements', 'specially', 'organizations', 'composed', 'people', 'medium', 'professional', 'rank', 'leader', 'up', 'warm', 'scent', 'charisma', 'lets', 'Guiness', 'smell', 'know', 'hidden', 'weakness', 'man', 'power.This', 'approach', 'suddenly', 'disturbed', 'when', 'officer', 'John', 'Mills', 'replace', 'Obviously', 'fact', 'inmediat', 'reaction', 'state', 'officers', 'Guiness', 'days', 'are', 'gone', 'yet', 'rules', 'disagree', 'psycolghical', 'handles', 'think', 'distingued', 'officer', 'will', 'be', 'capable', 'end', 'screwy', 'state', 'things.The', 'obstacles', 'are', 'countless', 'are', 'direct', 'rest', 'can', 'imagine', 'invisible', 'match', 'establish', 'real', 'rules', 'game', 'will', 'turn', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'ending', 'script', 'very', 'carefully', 'made', 'just', 'remember', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'filmed', 'Paths', 'Glory', 'important', 'due', 'bitter', 'atmosphere', 'item', 'related', 'authority', 'excess', 'was', 'not', 'accepted', 'society', 'status.Add', 'Korea', 'Cold', 'War', 'fifties', 'russian', 'invassion', 'Hungary', 'growing', 'nuclear', 'tension', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'visible', 'increase', 'peace', 'movements', 'world', 'multiple', 'facets', 'Litherature', 'poetry', 'painting', 'Jason', 'Pollock', 'music', 'rock', 'roll', 'cinema', 'New', 'Wave', 'birth', 'challenging', 'films', 'Baby', 'doll', 'waterfront', 'Anatomy', 'crime', 'raising', 'movements', 'protecting', 'nature', 'decade', 'fifties', 'society', 'was', 'opened', 'new', 'discoveries', 'sensations', 'search', 'remember', 'pill', 'was', 'discovered', 'middle', 'fifties', 'mood', 'made', 'loss', 'certain', 'principles', 'assumed', 'permanent.And', 'movie', 'direction', 'Watch', 'one', 'values', 'intentions', 'far', 'mere', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'react.Another', 'superb', 'achievement']",Tunes of Glory VHS

The garrison town is Stirling. The story is about power, resentment and a final reckoning on two counts. The power concerns the appointment of a new colonel to the Highland regiment (John Mills). The resentment is from the acting colonel, who is 'passed over' for that cherished post (Alec Guinness). The final reckoning? Watch the film! The encounters between them and their respective reactions in separate places, are at times, electrifying. The sub-text; the encounters between the sergeant major (a rigid and blustering Englishman) and the pipe major (the wonderful Duncan Macrae, with his lilting Highland accent) simply highlight two views of this world and the people in it.

370218,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,6303346375,Mr Peter G George,"[10, 10]","Tunes of Glory is one of the finest British films ever made. The story is unusual, for films about army life normally focus on wartime experiences. This film deals with the problems of peace in post-war Edinburgh. The conflict is no longer against a common enemy. Rather these soldiers split into factions and fight amongst themselves. The fight however is no longer clear and upfront, but subtle, insidious and at times downright nasty and cruel. The heart of this conflict is a battle of wills between Alec Guinness and John Mills. Guinness considers himself unjustly passed over for command and sets out to make the new commander's life a misery. Mills gives a wonderful performance as the commander desperately trying to gain the loyalty and respect of his men. He is a disciplinarian, but shows the psychological scars of his wartime experience in a Japanese prison camp. This part was originally assigned to Alec Guinness and it is clear that he could have performed it in a similar manner to his role in The Bridge on the River Kwai. Perhaps for the reason that he didn't want to repeat himself, Guinness decided to swap roles with Mills. The result is a remarkably convincing performance by Guinness. He makes a very good hard-drinking Scotsman with his red hair and his faultless accent. Susannah York also sounds as if she comes from Edinburgh and it is a pleasure to see her in her first important role. She looks stunning, but also shows that she could hold her own with the best of British actors. All of the fine performances in Tunes of Glory give the film a great emotional depth, leading up to a stunning and moving d&eacute;nouement.

From the outset tension is  visible and obvious as Sinclair relinquishes temporary command to Barrow.  Regimental life is a constant theme in this film, something that many  American's have never seen; the concept of the regiment as a family group.  Sinclair has served in the regiment his entire life, Barrow returns to it  only late in his career after initial service in it prior to World War II.  Sinclair prospered in the war, gaining distinction.  Barrow spent his war  in a Japanese POW camp and all that such an event may have held.  The  conflict is continuous and draws other members of the regiment into the  conflict, from other officers to the lynch pins of a Scottish regiment, the  regimental Sergeant Major and the Pipe Major.

There is much to the meaning of the title but I at least gained some immediate understanding when I saw how important the bagpipes were to this battalion.  This is the story of two competing officers.  One was acting commander commander and replaced by the new official commander.  Their styles of leadership were different.  In fact, they were more like opposites.  The popular acting commander became second in command with the arrival of the new commander and that was the breeding ground for all the emotional conflict that emerged in the film.This is a screenplay that could easily be adapted to the stage and I wouldn't be surprized if it has already been done.  The dialogue supercedes any action that takes place in the movie and that was OK with me.  The acting from top to bottom is supurb as well as the directing and, of course, the writing.  I may be out of step by rating this film with four stars instead of five.

370223,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6303346375,Reviewer,"[77, 77]","A clash of wills and personalities between two men, one a psychologically scarred idealist, the other driven by ego and his own needs to the point of cruelty, is examined in the peacetime military drama, &#8220;Tunes of Glory,&#8221; directed by Ronald Neame and starring Alec Guinness and John Mills.  Major Jock Sinclair (Guinness) is the acting Colonel of a Scottish regiment, but as the story begins he has been notified that he has been passed over for promotion and his replacement, Lieutenant Colonel Basil Barrow (Mills) is en route to take command.  Sinclair is a soldier&#8217;s soldier, a man&#8217;s man loved and respected (with some qualifications) by his men.  He has clawed his way up through the ranks, was once a piper (he would&#8217;ve been happy as a Pipe Major, in fact, but Hitler-- as he says at one point-- &#8220;Changed all that&#8221;), and feels strongly that he should have been made Colonel of the regiment.  Barrow, on the other hand, is an aristocrat and a third generation officer of this particular regiment.  He suffers, however, from his experience in a prisoner-of-war camp, and has never fully recovered, the impact of which is succinctly expressed when he tells his Captain that he never really came back.  From the beginning, it&#8217;s an almost impossible situation, and from the moment Barrows arrives the atmosphere is thick with tension as he and Sinclair square off in a contest from which it is readily evident that neither will emerge unscathed in one way or another .Working from a tight, intelligent screenplay by James Kennaway (adapted from his own novel), Neame delivers a taut, insightful character driven drama that explores the diversity of human nature, and illustrates the good and evil contained within us all and the traits which ultimately determine which will be the prevalent manifestation of the individual personality.  Through the device of placing the protagonist and the antagonist-- each the antithesis of the other-- in a no-win situation, the film examines motivations, actions and reactions that can lead the story in any number of directions, none of which are positive, but all of which are logical and which finally leads to a conclusion that is extremely powerful, incisive and totally believable.As Jock Sinclair, you see Alec Guinness in a role quite unlike anything else he&#8217;s ever done; it was, in fact, his own personal favorite of all of his cinematic creations.  Sinclair is a man who is course and rough-hewn, an egoist who, when the personal need arises, will wantonly subject those around him to psychological cruelty in order to elevate himself and his position and to assuage his own ego.  At mess, for example, he derides a young officer for not smoking his cigarette like a man; he orders every &#8220;man&#8221; to drink whiskey, implying that to do otherwise constitutes an assessment of an individual&#8217;s masculinity.  Boisterous bravura and ribald behavior are his tools of navigation through life, coupled with an attitude of doing things his way or the wrong way.  And Guinness plays it to the hilts.  Beginning with his whole perspective and attitude, he IS Sinclair, while physically he embodies and expresses exactly who this man is and what he stands for.  At times, his eyes fairly bulge with an enthusiasm that suggests a lasciviousness underlying the cruelty; when he walks he strides purposefully, and carries himself in such a way that when he enters a room he veritably fills it and makes his presence felt so that the very air seems oppressed by him.  It&#8217;s a performance that, even in a strong year of Oscar contenders (Trevor Howard, Lancaster, Lemmon, Olivier and Tracy were all up for Best Actor-- Lancaster won) he deserved to be among them.  In this film Guinness is quite simply unforgettable in one of his most powerful roles.John Mills, as well, delivers a superb, introspective performance as Barrow, capturing the way in which this man must live so inwardly to survive, and conveying how difficult it is for him to continue on while attempting to live up to his heritage and the expectations of a position to which he is clearly unfit in his current mental state.  In Barrow we see reflected the prevailing attitude of the times that &#8220;might makes right,&#8221; and that anything less is akin to unacceptable negligence, that same military mind-set that put Jake Holman at odds with the world in &#8220;The Sand Pebbles,&#8221; and led to the unfortunate incident depicted so eloquently in &#8220;A Few Good Men.&#8221;  It&#8217;s an excellent, understated, sensitive performance by Mills, who plays brilliantly off of Guinness&#8217;s brutishness.The film also boasts a number of excellent supporting performances, especially Dennis Price, as Major Charlie Scott, whose stoic assessment of himself as well as the situation at hand serves as the film&#8217;s conscience; Gordon Jackson as the sympathetic Captain Jimmy Cairns; and Duncan Macrae in a memorable turn as Pipe Major Duncan MacLean.Also included in this outstanding supporting cast are Kay Walsh (Mary), John Fraser (Ian), Susannah York (In her film debut as Morag Sinclair), Percy Herbert (Riddick), Allan Cuthbertson (Eric) and Angus Lennie (Orderly).  A powerful film that so successfully demonstrates the devastating effects of dysfunctional human relationships and conveys the need to look beyond ourselves, &#8220;Tunes of Glory&#8221; presents a story to which everyone will be able to relate because the theme is applicable to any setting involving human interactions.  A thoroughly involving film featuring a number of memorable performances (especially by Guinness) that will give you reason to take pause and reflect, and hopefully add some perspective to a world too often mired in unnecessary turmoil.",5,Alec Guinness In One Of His Best Roles,996192000,"07 27, 2001",2001,5815,"['clash', 'wills', 'personalities', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'psychologically', 'scarred',

370224,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6303346375,Robert Morris,"[12, 15]","Based on Richard Aldus' novel of the same title, James Kennaway wrote the screenplay  for this film, directed by Ronald Neame, in which Guinness plays what he claimed was one of his favorite roles, Lt. Col. Jock Sinclair. (Two years before, Neame and Guinness had teamed up on The Horse's Mouth which I also highly recommend.) There is really not much action in this film which focuses primarily on two lead characters: Sinclair and his newly assigned commanding officer, Col. Basil Barrow (Mills). Tensions and then conflicts between them develop almost immediately because they are so different. Barrow is English and somewhat aloof, well-educated, and a product of what could be viewed as the British ""military aristocracy""; in striking contrast, Sinclair is a proud Scot of modest background and education who has worked his way up through the ranks to his current position as an officer...and deeply resents just about everything Barrow represents to his (Sinclair's) tender sensibilities. Sinclair views Barrow as a ""toy soldier"" but has enough street smarts to realize that he must thoroughly undermine Barrow's authority before he can obtain it for himself.Hence the importance of fellow officer Maj. Charlie Scott, brilliantly portrayed by Dennis Price. (His is by far the strongest performance in the earlier Kind Hearts and Coronets in which Guinness also appeared, playing no less than eight different parts.) Scott has the social graces and political skills which Sinclair obviously lacks. However, Scott is one of those whom Dante would assign to the last -- and worst -- ring in Hell because, in a moral crisis, Scott will always preserve his neutrality. A sub plot involves Morag Sinclair (Susannah Price) and her romantic involvement with a young soldier who seems highly reputable. Of course, her father thoroughly disapproves. (Those who have seen The Sweet Smell of Success are urged to think of J.J. Hunseker's response to daughter Susan's interest in Steve Dallas.) The castle setting is almost smothering as Sinclair manipulates circumstances with skills worthy of Iago. Barrow becomes an object of pity as his authority gradually evaporates...and with it any sense of his self-worth.For many who see this film for the first time, Guinness will seem upsettingly ""out of character"" in the role of Sinclair. There are some qualities in him to admire as an officer but almost nothing to admire in him as a human being. We can only imagine how much venom has accumulated in his system over the years, throughout his difficult career, because of real or imagined slights. He now finds himself reporting to a commanding officer who bears no specific animosity toward him but who nonetheless energizes him as a lamb would a lion.Guinness savored his performance, as do we.

370225,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,6303346375,Roger J. Buffington,"[31, 32]","This is a great movie.  The time: immediately following the Second World War.  The place: Scotland, specifically the Scotts Highland Regiment.  The Regiment has returned from hard combat in North Africa and Europe, and once again is esconced in its barracks in the Scottish Highlands--the place in which it has been headquartered for over three hundred years.  The Acting Commanding Officer is Col. Jock Sinclair (Alec Guiness), a rough, uneducated man from the lower classes who worked his way up to Colonel from the ranks.  Sinclair got his promotion in the desert, fighting Rommel, and one senses that these experiences have created strong bonds of friendship between Sinclair and certain other officers in the battalion.  Now higher headquarters has assigned a new Commanding Officer to the battalion--Col. Basil Barrow, a university-educated man from the upper classes who comes from a long line of officers who served with, and indeed commanded, the battalion.  But Barrow, for all that, is viewed as an outsider and newcomer--while the other officers forged friendships in the war, fighting the Germans, Barrow was in the Pacific theater.  Sinclair is relegated to second-in-command.  Sinclair is deeply resentful of Barrow, and immediately gets off on the wrong foot with his new commander, unintentionally belittling Barrow's war service, most of which involved the horrors of being a POW tortured by the Japanese.  In fact, Colonel Barrow is deeply scarred by his wartime experience, and has lost perspective in dealing with his officers.  He is a martinet, and appears to forget that leadership involves earning the respect of one's subordinates--it is not simply bestowed from on-high.  Although both men love the Regiment above all else, this film is about an implacable conflict between Sinclair and Barrow.  For Sinclair does not respect Barrow, who he views as a ""spry wee gent who will not command the Battalion for very long...""The interaction between Barrow and Sinclair provides for an intense psychological confrontation.  This is a war movie without a war.  None is needed.  This is a superb study in leadership, confrontation, loyalty, and the nature of the tradition-rich Highland Regiment.  The class divisions among the Regimental officers is interestingly portrayed.  The entire cast turns in a fine performance, and Guiness is truly stellar as the rough-spoken Colonel Sinclair.The DVD is beautifully remastered, with crisp audio and video.  I've been keeping an old ratty videocassete of this film for years, hoping that the film would eventually turn up on DVD.  Now it has, and any film afficianado will enjoy this crisp, fast-paced and intense story.",5,An intense look at the psychological aftermath of war.,1094601600,"09 8, 2004",2004,2682,"['great', 'movie', 'time', 'immediately', 'following', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'place', 'Scotland', 'specifically', 'Scotts', 'Highland', 'Regiment', 'Regiment', 'returned', 'hard', 'combat', 'North', 'Africa', 'Europe', 'once', 'again', 'esconced', 'barracks', 'Scottish', 'Highlands', 'place', 'been', 'headquartered', 'three', 'hundred', 'years', 'Acting', 'Commanding', 'Officer', 'Col.', 'Jock', 'Sinclair', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'rough', 'uneducated', 'man', 'lower', 'classes', 'who', 'worked', 'way', 'Colonel', 'ranks', 'Sinclair', 'got', 'promotion', 'desert', 'fighting', 'Rommel', 'one', 'experiences', 'have', 'created', 'strong', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'Sinclair', 'certain', 'other', 'officers', 'battalion', 'Now', 'higher', 'headquarters', 'assigned', 'new', 'Commanding', 'Officer', 'battalion', 'Col', 'Basil', 'Barrow', 'university-educated', 'man', 'upper', 'classes', 'who', 'long', 'line', 'officers', 'who', 'served', 'indeed', 'commanded', 'battalion', 'Barrow', 'viewed', 'outsider', 'newcomer', 'other', 'officers', 'forged', 'friendships', 'war', 'fighting', 'Germans', 'Barrow', 'was', 'Pacific', 'theater', 'Sinclair', 'relegated', 'second-in-command', 'Sinclair', 'deeply', 'resentful', 'Barrow', 'immediately', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'new', 'commander', 'unintentionally', 'belittling', 'Barrow', 'war', 'service', 'most', 'involved', 'horrors', 'being', 'POW', 'tortured', 'Japanese', 'fact', 'Colonel', 'Barrow', 'deeply', 'scarred', 'wartime', 'experience', 'lost', 'perspective', 'dealing', 'officers', 'martinet', 'forget', 'leadership', 'earning', 'respect', 'one', 'subordinates', 'not', 'simply', 'bestowed', 'on-high', 'men', 'love', 'Regiment', 'else', 'film', 'implacable', 'conflict', 'Sinclair', 'Barrow', 'Sinclair', 'not', 'respect', 'Barrow', 'who', 'spry', 'wee', 'gent', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'command', 'Battalion', 'very', 'long', 'interaction', 'Barrow', 'Sinclair', 'intense', 'psychological', 'confrontation', 'war', 'movie', 'war', 'None', 'needed', 'superb', 'study', 'leadership', 'confrontation', 'loyalty', 'nature', 'tradition-rich', 'Highland', 'Regiment', 'class', 'divisions', 'Regimental', 'officers', 'interestingly', 'portrayed', 'entire', 'cast', 'fine', 'performance', 'Guiness', 'truly', 'stellar', 'rough-spoken', 'Colonel', 'Sinclair.The', 'DVD', 'beautifully', 'remastered', 'crisp', 'audio', 'video', ""'ve"", 'been', 'keeping', 'old', 'ratty', 'videocassete', 'film', 'years', 'hoping', 'film', 'would', 'eventually', 'turn', 'up', 'DVD', 'Now', 'film', 'afficianado', 'will', 'enjoy', 'crisp', 'fast-paced', 'intense', 'story']",Tunes of Glory VHS
370226,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,6303346375,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[18, 19]","This is a most excellent movie.  Both Alec Guineness and John Mills put in great performances as two troubled commanding officers squaring off for command of a post war Scottish regiment.  The acting is supurb all around.  What I find most interesting is the depiction of regimental life. Few movies have ever provided such a vivid and lush view of being an officer in the Britsih army in the post war period. One can see that the comfortable and cozy regimental lifestyle continued for many years until recently where cut-backs and reductions in the army have no doubt curtailed much of what we see here.Still, this movie shows how regimental tradition is so important in the British army, and in Scottish regiments in particular.  The pipes are a part of every day life with their various duty tunes played throughout the day as shown in the film.  The dancing scene where the officers are all brought out on parade early in the morning was not unknown, and shows that social comportment was a much greater factor in the past than it is today. We never get to know which Highland regiment is being portrayed in this movie.  The location is most likely Stirling Castle which would make it the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders, yet there is a lot of evidence to indicate the contrary.  It seems that the regiment portrayed is an amalgam of all the Highland units in the British army, and does not indicate any one in particular.  To have highlighted one regiment over all the others would have been unfair and so perhaps  was a conscious decision made by the producers of the movie.Americans will find the regimental life shown here somewhat different than what is normally associated with army life.  These british regiments have every bit as much esprit de corps as anything that can be found in the US army.  In fact, regiments matter little in the US army.  Divisions and Services are the important thing, not the regiment.  Perhaps it was no suprise when the great desk general Colin Powell asked the pipe major of the Argylls recently what accounted for such great morale in the British army: The only response he got was &quot;the regiment sir!&quot;  Powell could only nodd his head!  Anyway, this movie is great to watch not only for the fine acting, but for its sets and portrayal of army life in a bygone era.",5,Peace Time Rivalries in a Scottish Regiment,1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,2323,"['most', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Alec', 'Guineness', 'John', 'Mills', 'put', 'great', 'performances', 'two', 'troubled', 'commanding', 'officers', 'squaring', 'off', 'command', 'post', 'war', 'Scottish', 'regiment', 'acting', 'supurb', 'around', 'What', 'find', 'most', 'interesting', 'depiction', 'regimental', 'life', 'Few', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'provided', 'vivid', 'lush', 'view', 'being', 'officer', 'Britsih', 'army', 'post', 'war', 'period', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'comfortable', 'cozy', 'regimental', 'lifestyle', 'continued', 'many', 'years', 'recently', 'where', 'cut-backs', 'reductions', 'army', 'have', 'doubt', 'curtailed', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'here.Still', 'movie', 'how', 'regimental', 'tradition', 'so', 'important', 'British', 'army', 'Scottish', 'regiments', 'particular', 'pipes', 'are', 'part', 'day', 'life', 'various', 'duty', 'tunes', 'played', 'day', 'shown', 'film', 'dancing', 'scene', 'where', 'officers', 'are', 'brought', 'out', 'parade', 'early', 'morning', 'was', 'not', 'unknown', 'social', 'comportment', 'was', 'much', 'greater', 'factor', 'past', 'today', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'Highland', 'regiment', 'being', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'location', 'most', 'likely', 'Stirling', 'Castle', 'would', 'make', 'Argyll', 'amp', 'Sutherland', 'Highlanders', 'yet', 'lot', 'evidence', 'indicate', 'contrary', 'regiment', 'portrayed', 'amalgam', 'Highland', 'units', 'British', 'army', 'not', 'indicate', 'one', 'particular', 'have', 'highlighted', 'one', 'regiment', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unfair', 'so', 'perhaps', 'was', 'conscious', 'decision', 'made', 'producers', 'movie.Americans', 'will', 'find', 'regimental', 'life', 'shown', 'here', 'somewhat', 'different', 'what', 'normally', 'associated', 'army', 'life', 'british', 'regiments', 'have', 'bit', 'much', 'esprit', 'de', 'corps', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'US', 'army', 'fact', 'regiments', 'matter', 'little', 'US', 'army', 'Divisions', 'Services', 'are', 'important', 'thing', 'not', 'regiment', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'suprise', 'when', 'great', 'desk', 'general', 'Colin', 'Powell', 'asked', 'pipe', 'major', 'Argylls', 'recently', 'what', 'accounted', 'such', 'great', 'morale', 'British', 'army', 'only', 'response', 'got', 'was', 'quot', 'regiment', 'sir', 'quot', 'Powell', 'could', 'only', 'nodd', 'head', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'great', 'watch', 'not', 'only', 'fine', 'acting', 'sets', 'portrayal', 'army', 'life', 'bygone', 'era']",Tunes of Glory VHS

Henderson,"[6, 6]","Another reason why Academy Awards (or any competitive awards for art) can't be trusted is proven by Guinness' failure to win one for what must be one of his greatest performances...from the very first scene with him it's obvious that the right choice was made to cast him in the role of Col. Jock Sinclair instead of Col. Barrows.  There's no denying that without the wonderful script (and novel) by James Kennaway this could've been a boring ""soldiers in peacetime"" stage play but with Guinness and Mills duking it out from the get-go you are riveted by their performances.  The supporting cast couldn't be better.  The final scene is heartbreaking and just goes to show what a versatile actor Sir Alec was.  The only truly interesting extra on this Criterion release is director Ronald Neame's interview which directly relates to the film...Mills' voice-only interview is too short and not too illuminating and the interview with Sir Alec is way too long...I didn't really get into it as it covers too much territory and from the first 10 minutes seemed like it could have gone on for 3 hours.

370230,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,6303346375,Zack Davisson,"[19, 19]","""Tunes of Glory"" is everything you might want from this type of movie.  Full of rough-hewn Scots drinking life with the same enthusiasm as they drink their whisky, ""Tunes of Glory"" plays wistfully with the Scottish stereotypes of good natured, dancing and singing soldiers of a highland regiment.  There are tunes a'plenty, and twirling kilts and bagpipes as well.  A story of post-war peacetime soldiers, one cannot call it a war movie or but it is military in flavor,with pipes and drum corp assembled.In addition to the Scottish pageantry is a surprisingly deep storyline and some of Sir Alec Guinness's and Sir John Mills's best acting, which is saying a lot about those two giants of film.  Both play against type, with Guinness's surprising turn as red-haired Jock Sinclair, the course and gutter-born Major who seeks to be Battalion Commander, and Mill's emotionally unstable yet straight-laced Battalion Commander Basil Barrow, the very opposite of the spirited garrison who struggles to keep control.  Both characters are likeable, yet deeply flawed, and it is a question as to which will overcome their defects and rise.The looseness and fun-loving background of the regiment is a fine background for the tense struggle of Sinclair and Barrow.  Supporting characters, such as the slippery Charlie Scott,  and Sinclair's daughter Morag and her beau the handsome piper Ian Fraser, provide counter balance and some much-needed affection in this heroless film.The Criterion Collection DVD is of course excellent, with a few insightful interviews with Sir Alec Guinness, Sir John Mills and director Ronald Neame.  There is also a nice essay by Robert Murphy, which adds to the appreciation of the film.",5,"Whisky for thems that like it.
