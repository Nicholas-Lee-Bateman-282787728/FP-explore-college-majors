1067643,AEQ8WWTOB9VSO,B000OZ2CU2,Dent K.,"[0, 2]","Tenchi in Tokyo is the 3rd Tenchi Muyo series. While the original and Universe are nearly beloved by all, Tokyo always gets a mixed reaction at best. That does not mean that Tokyo is a bad series. I personally found the series to be quite good.This was the 2nd reboot of the franchise, since it worked with Universe, the creators decided to do it again. So to begin yes, it is not a sequel to either of the earlier series. It's still the same deal, Tenchi and the wild ladies have more wacky adventures.The story this time focuses on Tenchi going to Tokyo more a few reasons. Grandpa tells Tenchi that he must work at a shrine in Tokyo for his friend. Tenchi agrees but mostly for the fact it gets him away from the girls. The girls hate this of course, so in their desperation, they have Washu build a portal to take them to Tenchi's pad in Tokyo. Along the way Tenchi meets a new girl named Sakuya, who like the rest of the girls, falls for Tenchi. This leads to the girls finding out about Sakuya and then the fireworks start. Add an enigmatic girl named Yukie, and thus sets the story of Tokyo in motion.The cast from the dub return as they once again knock it out of the park. It's your call which way you want to watch them but both are still top-notch.There are some new twists to Tokyo. First of all at the beginning, Tenchi has already met the girls. You do not find out how Tenchi met them all until about halfway through the series. The story is also more moody and depressing than the earlier entries.The most obvious new feature is the new animation style. It was done to help with the comedy scenes because the original style was felt to be too restrictive emotion wise. So they went with a new style to make it more funny. Did it work? Not really as they went back the original style after this for the first Universe movie, though they did the animation for Tenchi Forever in this style though.The story also gets heat for Sakuya. She is not a bad character, but the fact she just entered the show and went right after Tenchi really riled up fans. Do not worry as the story resolves this in a rather unpredictable way.Tokyo was the last full Tenchi series to arrive for Toonami. Afterwards the creators went back to making the Tenchi movies, and then the frachise went on hiatus for a few years. They returned to finish the original series with the 3rd Ryo-Ohki OVA....the less said about that the better.Tenchi in Tokyo gets a bad rep, but when the first two entries were the peak of the harem genre then the criticism is at least valid. Some of the new characters are annoying or just plain boring. The music is also weaker compared to the previous series.Is Tokyo the best Tenchi anime? NoIs Tokyo worth watching? YesPros:The old characters are still a blast to watch.The darker turn really helps the story.Cons: The animation is just not as good as the original entries in my opinion.The new characters are,for the most part, just bland and boring.Overall: It's weaker than the original series and Universe, but it's still a worthwhile entry in the franchise. I'd say give Tenchi in Tokyo at least a watch, then decide whether it is for you.",4,"Some like it, some don't...but is it worth your time?",1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,3161,"['Tenchi', 'Tokyo', '3rd', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'series', 'original', 'Universe', 'are', 'nearly', 'beloved', 'Tokyo', 'always', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'best', 'not', 'mean', 'Tokyo', 'bad', 'series', 'personally', 'found', 'series', 'be', 'quite', 'good.This', 'was', '2nd', 'reboot', 'franchise', 'worked', 'Universe', 'creators', 'decided', 'do', 'again', 'So', 'begin', 'yes', 'not', 'sequel', 'earlier', 'series', 'still', 'same', 'deal', 'Tenchi', 'wild', 'ladies', 'have', 'more', 'wacky', 'adventures.The', 'story', 'time', 'Tenchi', 'going', 'Tokyo', 'more', 'few', 'reasons', 'Grandpa', 'Tenchi', 'must', 'work', 'shrine', 'Tokyo', 'friend', 'Tenchi', 'mostly', 'fact', 'away', 'girls', 'girls', 'hate', 'course', 'so', 'desperation', 'have', 'Washu', 'build', 'portal', 'take', 'Tenchi', 'pad', 'Tokyo', 'way', 'Tenchi', 'new', 'girl', 'named', 'Sakuya', 'who', 'rest', 'girls', 'falls', 'Tenchi', 'girls', 'finding', 'out', 'Sakuya', 'then', 'fireworks', 'start', 'Add', 'enigmatic', 'girl', 'named', 'Yukie', 'thus', 'story', 'Tokyo', 'motion.The', 'cast', 'dub', 'return', 'once', 'again', 'knock', 'park', 'call', 'way', 'want', 'watch', 'are', 'still', 'are', 'new', 'twists', 'Tokyo', 'First', 'beginning', 'Tenchi', 'already', 'met', 'girls', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Tenchi', 'met', 'halfway', 'series', 'story', 'also', 'more', 'moody', 'depressing', 'earlier', 'most', 'obvious', 'new', 'feature', 'new', 'animation', 'style', 'was', 'done', 'help', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'original', 'style', 'was', 'felt', 'be', 'too', 'restrictive', 'emotion', 'wise', 'went', 'new', 'style', 'make', 'more', 'funny', 'Did', 'work', 'Not', 'really', 'went', 'back', 'original', 'style', 'first', 'Universe', 'movie', 'did', 'animation', 'Tenchi', 'Forever', 'style', 'though.The', 'story', 'also', 'heat', 'Sakuya', 'not', 'bad', 'character', 'fact', 'just', 'entered', 'show', 'went', 'right', 'Tenchi', 'really', 'riled', 'up', 'fans', 'Do', 'not', 'worry', 'story', 'rather', 'unpredictable', 'way.Tokyo', 'was', 'last', 'full', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'arrive', 'Toonami', 'creators', 'went', 'back', 'making', 'Tenchi', 'movies', 'then', 'frachise', 'went', 'hiatus', 'few', 'years', 'returned', 'finish', 'original', 'series', '3rd', 'Ryo-Ohki', 'OVA', '.the', 'less', 'said', 'better.Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'bad', 'rep', 'when', 'first', 'two', 'entries', 'were', 'peak', 'harem', 'genre', 'then', 'criticism', 'least', 'valid', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'annoying', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'music', 'also', 'weaker', 'compared', 'previous', 'series.Is', 'Tokyo', 'best', 'Tenchi', 'anime', 'NoIs', 'Tokyo', 'watching', 'YesPros', 'old', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'blast', 'watch.The', 'darker', 'turn', 'really', 'story.Cons', 'animation', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'entries', 'opinion.The', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'bland', 'boring.Overall', 'weaker', 'original', 'series', 'Universe', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'entry', 'franchise', ""'d"", 'say', 'give', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'least', 'watch', 'then']",Tenchi in Tokyo: Collection

This Tenchi series explores the gang and their seperation with Tenchi as he goes to Tokyo to train as a priest.  This series is one of my favorite not for the animation or hilarity, and the comedy is rather good in this installment,  but rather that this series shows Tenchi making a choice with his love life and the ramifications of that choice.  This series does come with its problems like low production animation in some episodes and bad translations in some parts if you watch the japanese audio, but this series never stops from being both charming and interesting.  The characters are cared for and it shows in this series.  The sense of family is this series greatest triumph.  So if you are a fan of the series I would strongly suggest this and if you are not, though I still suggest watching it, it would be best to start with the OVA's first to better get a handle on the series and what it's about.

1067651,AGQF1EMUZC3VB,B000OZ2CU2,Peyton C. Presgrove,"[2, 5]","OK so, another Tenchi Re-release, always good, but oh my its Tokyo (or Shin Tenchi-Muyo in Japan)  Well lets get this review started.Basically Tenchi In Tokyo is considered the Black sheep of the Tenchi Franchise, and for good reason, out of the various series its the weakest ( though arguably still loads better then OVA 3, but thats another rant for another time.)As I mentioned in my Tenchi Universe review, part of what makes the Tenchi series so fun to watch is that its essentially a hodge-podge or melting pot of all the various genres rolled into one.  Tenchi In Tokyo however is highly un-balnced!  This particular series focuses way to much on the Romance aspects of Tenchi throwing the other parts to the side!I'm sure as you can guess by the name, this particular entry in the series involves Tenchi moving away to Tokyo to attend some fancy school there or what not.  Of course the girls are none to happy about this (especially Ayeka & Ryoko who are flat out against Tenchi leaving his country home.)  Tenchi however goes ahead with his plans to move to Tokyo and attend school there, leaving behind a very disgruntled  Jurian Princess and Space Pirate.  After Tenchi arrives in Tokyo he meets Sakuya, your typical cute popular school-girl  the two quickly become friends and this is where Tenchi's Trouble begins, not only have the others found out about Sakuya due to Washu inventing a portal for the girls to go directly to Tenchi's apartment, but there none to happy about this, thus adding another layer to Tenchi's romantic woes, sounds good right!?  WRONG!  The thing is Sakuya isn't a very interesting character, she's bland one dimensional, and even once we learn who she really is, you don't really feel that bad for her.And speaking of characters, one thing that really bugs me about this series is half the gals get the shaft for most of it, sure as per usual Ayeka & Ryoko still play a big part, and Sasami is pretty important later on.  But  Kiyone, Mihoshi, & Washu seem to get side-lined more often then not for a decent chunk of the series, seriously side-lining half your gals, NOT COOL!  Given its understandable as the three arn't part of the love triangle, square, whatever... but yeah.I will say this though, in the series defense it does have slightly better animation then Universe, that is to say the animation style is more fluid and less stiff then what we saw in TU, but slightly more stylistic animation is really the only plus this particular entry has going for it.So yeah, overall this show has more then its fair share of problems, none the less though I would probably still recommend watching it at least once, despite all of its flaws it still manages to have that Tenchi charm we have come to expect from the series through the original OVA's ,Universe, & The Films, just not quit on the same level.So would I suggest buying this, well it depends, if your a big fan of the Tenchi franchise, a fan of older anime, or just a completist, sure.  If not, probably best just to wait and borrow this from a friend or check it out whenever Funimation puts it up for streaming on their website.But yeah, overall while this may be a more mediocre Tenchi series, even mediocre Tenchi is a heck of a lot better then most of that otaku-centric drek Japan has been pumping out for the past 7-8 years, lol.",3,"One Of The Weaker Entries In The Tenchi Franchise, But Still Worth Checking Out!",1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,3343,"['OK', 'so', 'Tenchi', 'Re-release', 'always', 'good', 'oh', 'Tokyo', 'Shin', 'Tenchi-Muyo', 'Japan', 'Well', 'get', 'review', 'started.Basically', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'considered', 'Black', 'sheep', 'Tenchi', 'Franchise', 'good', 'reason', 'various', 'series', 'weakest', 'arguably', 'still', 'better', 'then', 'OVA', '3', 'rant', 'time', 'mentioned', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'review', 'part', 'what', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'essentially', 'hodge-podge', 'melting', 'pot', 'various', 'genres', 'rolled', 'one', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'however', 'highly', 'un-balnced', 'particular', 'series', 'way', 'much', 'Romance', 'aspects', 'Tenchi', 'throwing', 'other', 'parts', 'side', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'guess', 'name', 'particular', 'entry', 'series', 'Tenchi', 'moving', 'away', 'Tokyo', 'attend', 'fancy', 'school', 'there', 'what', 'not', 'course', 'girls', 'are', 'none', 'happy', 'especially', 'Ayeka', 'Ryoko', 'who', 'are', 'flat', 'Tenchi', 'leaving', 'country', 'home', 'Tenchi', 'however', 'ahead', 'plans', 'move', 'Tokyo', 'attend', 'school', 'there', 'leaving', 'very', 'disgruntled', 'Jurian', 'Princess', 'Space', 'Pirate', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'Sakuya', 'typical', 'cute', 'popular', 'school-girl', 'two', 'quickly', 'become', 'friends', 'where', 'Tenchi', 'Trouble', 'begins', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'others', 'found', 'out', 'Sakuya', 'due', 'Washu', 'inventing', 'portal', 'girls', 'go', 'directly', 'Tenchi', 'apartment', 'there', 'none', 'happy', 'thus', 'adding', 'layer', 'Tenchi', 'romantic', 'woes', 'good', 'right', 'WRONG', 'thing', 'Sakuya', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'bland', 'one', 'dimensional', 'even', 'learn', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'bad', 'her.And', 'speaking', 'characters', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'bugs', 'series', 'gals', 'get', 'shaft', 'most', 'sure', 'usual', 'Ayeka', 'Ryoko', 'still', 'play', 'big', 'part', 'Sasami', 'pretty', 'important', 'later', 'Kiyone', 'Mihoshi', 'Washu', 'seem', 'get', 'side-lined', 'more', 'often', 'then', 'not', 'decent', 'chunk', 'series', 'seriously', 'side-lining', 'half', 'gals', 'NOT', 'COOL', 'Given', 'understandable', 'three', 'ar', ""n't"", 'part', 'love', 'triangle', 'square', 'yeah.I', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'series', 'defense', 'have', 'slightly', 'better', 'animation', 'then', 'Universe', 'say', 'animation', 'style', 'more', 'fluid', 'less', 'stiff', 'then', 'what', 'saw', 'TU', 'slightly', 'more', 'stylistic', 'animation', 'really', 'only', 'particular', 'entry', 'going', 'it.So', 'yeah', 'overall', 'show', 'more', 'then', 'fair', 'share', 'problems', 'none', 'less', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'recommend', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'flaws', 'still', 'have', 'Tenchi', 'charm', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'series', 'original', 'OVA', 'Universe', 'Films', 'just', 'not', 'quit', 'same', 'level.So', 'would', 'suggest', 'buying', 'well', 'big', 'fan', 'Tenchi', 'franchise', 'fan', 'older', 'anime', 'just', 'completist', 'sure', 'not', 'probably', 'best', 'just', 'wait', 'borrow', 'friend', 'check', 'out', 'whenever', 'Funimation', 'up', 'streaming', 'website.But', 'yeah', 'overall', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'mediocre', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'even', 'mediocre', 'Tenchi', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'most', 'otaku-centric', 'drek', 'Japan', 'been', 'pumping', 'out', 'past', '7-8', 'years', 'lol']",Tenchi in Tokyo: Collection

Bad character designs, bad musical choices, and bizarre fight scenes make this VERY questionable as to where the creators' minds were at when they made this series.  A very strange and poor choice for those who love everything Tenchi Muyo...

The humor and story of this series is very entertaining especially for those of us who like the usual harem animes,  the voice cast for the Japanese crew were very well done sadly you can't really say the same with the English cast who were at best 50/50 in their character roles some were enjoyable enough others you couldn't help but wince as they did their lines but not unexpected sometimes with a dubbed cast.  The animation is decent but if you're expecting the animation we've seen in the last five years or so than you will be disappointed but I say try and look past this because if you do you'll be surprised at how entertained you truly become as you watch the show.

In this series the cast does act more like a harem, in the other series it's more like a love triangle.The plot takes to long to get interesting, but the last few episodes are really good, although the ending felt forced to me.  And their are a few episodes that are pointless. They serve no purpose and do not move the story along in any way, and can be somewhat boring. The main antagonist is also one of the most boring I have seen in a show.If you've never watched a Tenchi series I recommend you start elsewhere.",3,"Okay, but better Tenchi series out there.",1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,572,"['think', 'weakest', 'main', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'series', 'cast', 'act', 'more', 'harem', 'other', 'series', 'more', 'love', 'triangle.The', 'plot', 'long', 'get', 'interesting', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'ending', 'felt', 'forced', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'pointless', 'serve', 'purpose', 'do', 'not', 'move', 'story', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'main', 'antagonist', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'have', 'seen', 'show.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'recommend', 'start', 'elsewhere']",Tenchi in Tokyo: Collection
