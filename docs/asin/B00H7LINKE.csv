The one decent character in this pill popping, venomous , snarling, gut wrenching confession, dark secret brouhaha that makes Maury Povich looks like a Sunday School Class in the Mormon Church by comparison..oh and did I mention a shovel slapped up the side of the head just as an ""accent moment"".Sometimes we try too hard to ""get noticed"" by our peers at the Academy. In trutyh, we really don't enjoy watchign peopel we lvoe grovel, slap, curse, wretch, and otherwise go post menopausal  female hormone haywire, screeching  desperadoes.This was just exhausting and demoralizing. Any of you out there ever suffered vicious emasculation from your mother? Here's a good one: this mother had an affair with the father in law, this incestuous sin resulted in a houng man whois sweet as he cn be, a lovign soul, but clumsy and inept, and will never do well in theworld..and this mother's vicious verbal castration of him in front of the entire family, at a funeral..is pure evil..taking her egregious sin out on a hapless child of hers for his poor pathetic life. Most of the chronically ill tempered, foul mouth emasculating women, who say thigns with their mouths no dedcent person would hold in their hand, all have men leaving their asexual, menopausal hatefulness for a younger woman...uuhhhh...and they wonder why? If this movie does nothing else, it should win an acadamy awar for portraying women in some other light than 'sugar and spice and everything ncie""...women can be devious, shallow, vain, ruthless, and mean as gila monsters. Now if there's an acadamy award for that..this film  will walk away with a half dozen oscars.There IS a way to do a serious drama, write a serious drama. Take a look at Hellen Mirren in ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" by Tennesee Williams.  That is art. Woody Allen threw his hat in the ring about addicted, vain, wordly, vicious women in ""Blue Jasmine"", which seems oddly like a pretty ugly portrayal of Mia farrow's fin de ciecle. But for a good way to portray a 'woman wronged' one can also check out Hellen Mirren in ""The Tempest""..where at least, some wrongs are righted ""by unseen forces"" WE movie goers can take only so much endless ""spewing"" and wretching of hideousness...we have to have some kind of redemption,soem scintilla of relief... some sense that things can turn out well. Yet I suppose a lifetime of drug and alcohol abuse, has no other ending than torture in Hell after we finished our hideousness here on earth. Often when we see, hear, watch ugliness of this kind..we may bet our framed 2 dollar bill that the author who wring this angst from his tortured soul...di so with the help of vast quantities of alcohol.The real question is begged...how in God's name did so many fine actors and actresses get drawn into this black hole to begin with?",1,pay attention to the low star-ratings. this is just plain sad,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,2935,"['suppose', 'decided', 'make', 'chick', 'movie', 'Hades', 'respect', 'great', 'actors', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'time', 'favorite', 'one', 'decent', 'character', 'pill', 'popping', 'venomous', 'snarling', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'confession', 'dark', 'secret', 'brouhaha', 'Maury', 'Povich', 'Sunday', 'School', 'Class', 'Mormon', 'Church', 'comparison..oh', 'did', 'mention', 'shovel', 'slapped', 'up', 'side', 'head', 'just', 'accent', 'moment', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'get', 'noticed', 'peers', 'Academy', 'trutyh', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'watchign', 'peopel', 'lvoe', 'grovel', 'slap', 'curse', 'wretch', 'otherwise', 'go', 'post', 'menopausal', 'female', 'hormone', 'haywire', 'screeching', 'desperadoes.This', 'was', 'just', 'exhausting', 'demoralizing', 'there', 'ever', 'suffered', 'vicious', 'emasculation', 'mother', 'Here', 'good', 'one', 'mother', 'had', 'affair', 'father', 'law', 'incestuous', 'sin', 'resulted', 'houng', 'man', 'sweet', 'be', 'lovign', 'soul', 'clumsy', 'inept', 'will', 'never', 'do', 'well', 'theworld..and', 'mother', 'vicious', 'verbal', 'castration', 'front', 'entire', 'family', 'funeral..is', 'pure', 'evil..taking', 'egregious', 'sin', 'out', 'hapless', 'child', 'hers', 'poor', 'pathetic', 'life', 'Most', 'chronically', 'ill', 'tempered', 'foul', 'mouth', 'emasculating', 'women', 'who', 'say', 'thigns', 'mouths', 'dedcent', 'person', 'would', 'hold', 'hand', 'have', 'men', 'leaving', 'asexual', 'menopausal', 'hatefulness', 'younger', 'woman', 'uuhhhh', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', 'should', 'win', 'acadamy', 'awar', 'portraying', 'women', 'other', 'light', ""'sugar"", 'spice', 'everything', 'ncie', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'devious', 'shallow', 'vain', 'ruthless', 'mean', 'gila', 'monsters', 'Now', 'acadamy', 'award', 'that..this', 'film', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'half', 'dozen', 'way', 'do', 'serious', 'drama', 'write', 'serious', 'drama', 'Take', 'look', 'Hellen', 'Mirren', 'Roman', 'Spring', 'Mrs.', 'Stone', 'Tennesee', 'Williams', 'art', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'threw', 'hat', 'ring', 'addicted', 'vain', 'wordly', 'vicious', 'women', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'oddly', 'pretty', 'ugly', 'portrayal', 'Mia', 'farrow', 'fin', 'de', 'ciecle', 'good', 'way', 'portray', ""'woman"", 'wronged', 'one', 'can', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'Hellen', 'Mirren', 'Tempest', '..where', 'least', 'wrongs', 'are', 'righted', 'unseen', 'forces', 'WE', 'movie', 'goers', 'can', 'take', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'spewing', 'wretching', 'hideousness', 'have', 'have', 'kind', 'redemption', 'soem', 'scintilla', 'relief', 'sense', 'things', 'can', 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'suppose', 'lifetime', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'other', 'ending', 'torture', 'Hell', 'finished', 'hideousness', 'here', 'earth', 'when', 'see', 'hear', 'watch', 'ugliness', 'kind..we', 'may', 'bet', 'framed', '2', 'dollar', 'bill', 'author', 'who', 'wring', 'angst', 'tortured', 'soul', 'so', 'help', 'vast', 'quantities', 'alcohol.The', 'real', 'question', 'begged', 'how', 'God', 'name', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'fine', 'actors', 'actresses', 'get', 'drawn', 'black', 'hole', 'begin']",N/A

What follows is two hours of ugliness that is actually kind of enjoyable (because it is not happening to the viewer).Just visualize two foul-mouthed she-dragons at a big dinner table and you will get the idea; Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts as mom and daughter rip each other new ones, over and over. They are both wonderful. But it gets tense for the entire clan: old emotional wounds are scratched open, weaknesses are exposed, secrets are revealed, and failures are broadcast. There's even a physical altercation between daughter and mother.Sam Shepard was wonderful in the beginning of the movie; I wanted to see more of him.Overall this was fun stuff in a guilty pleasure way, but it felt a little too much like some uncomfortable holiday dinners I experienced myself as a kid.

After a recent tragedy, estranged mother Violet (Meryl Steep) is forced to reunite with her strong-willed daughters. Each scene is utterly predictable, and the emotional moments don't come off as natural as they should.Shot almost identically to the play, John Wells doesn't bring any of his own flare or style to the direction.

So, I was excited for August: Osage County when I bought it.  The writing is very good, the acting is excellent, the cast is great, and the film had a nicely dark tone.  However, after a while, I found myself more and more depressed by the likes of this very dysfunctional family.  Letts' other works can also be said to involve family dysfunction.  However, they are presented more as dark comedies.  August is more true to life and, therefore, a pretty heavy downer when it comes to its major themes.  Like I said, the movie isn't bad.  It's actually good.  This review is based on my own personal tastes.  I appreciate good writing and acting, but, like I said, the movie left me feeling like I'm living in a pretty bleak and hopeless world (at least when it comes to intimate human relationships).

It was predictable on a lot of levels, and not every shocking or surprising. Meryl Streep was fabulous as usual with her ability to lose herself into her character and show all the imperfections and damage. Julianne Nicholson is a delight, and she nailed her part. This is the actor who deserved an Oscar nomination. Check our her role there as opposed to the doctor on Masters of Sex, and you will get what I mean. I have been watching her career for many years and she has a lot of range and is really under appreciated. I don't understand how Julia Roberts could possibly get an Oscar nomination for this. I guess Hollywood popularity is more important than talent. She plays two roles in all her movies. The smiley, vulnerable endearing &#34;pretty woman&#34; and the self-absorbed, manipulative &#34;w!tch&#34;. She has no range outside of that and in both cases it seems she plays herself because she acts the same way in her real life in interviews, etc. There are a thousand actors who could have done better. It seemed like she was just saying her lines (or shouting them), but you didn't get a sense of who the character was and what she was really thinking and feeling. I think Julia had possibilities earlier in her career, when she took more risks like Mary Reily. Now she just seems to go through the motions and not really care about bringing authenticity to her characters. Benedict Cumberbatch really nailed his role too.

1684460,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00H7LINKE,Darren,"[2, 3]","Tracy Letts' famous play receives a sufficient enough airing out by director John Wells, along with enough sensible script-pruning by Letts himself, to make a very entertaining picture, on the order of rubbernecking a horrible accident on the highway.  The cast simply cannot be bettered: Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Ewan McGregor, Chris Cooper, Abigail Breslin, Benedict Cumberbatch, Juliette Lewis (nice to see her again -- seems like it's been awhile), Margo Martindale, Dermot Mulroney, and Julianne Nicholson.  Oh, and Sam Shepard, too.  Of course, Pulitzer Prize-winning plays aren't what they used to be.  Just as with the Age of Shakespeare, America's theatrical Golden Age -- when giants like Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and Sam Shepard himself dominated the boards -- has long passed into history, never to return.  And so we get derivative works like ""August: Osage County"", which borrows from several of those Golden Age authors, Albee in particular, what with all the Big Reveals and Shocking Revelations and so on.  (Letts performed as an actor in a revival of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", which clearly had a huge impact on him.)Perhaps the first problem with the play is its title.  Look, call it either ""August"" OR ""Osage County"".  Not both.  But really the main problem is that it just seems so familiar (cf. those Golden Age playwrights), and Letts, perhaps knowing this, selects ""sordid"" as his default mode when it comes to behavior, motivations, and family secrets.  (Perhaps he should've called the play: ""OMG: Drama"".)  Let it be said at once that Meryl Streep is cleverer than the material: she wisely overplays the role of Vi to the max, chewing scenery whenever there's the slightest opportunity to do so.  This is intelligent, because an understated performance would expose this material for the ""Lifetime Movie of the Week"" it fundamentally is, to say nothing of generating misplaced audience sympathy for what in fact is a terrific villain -- ""Vi"", for short.  Most of the cast wisely follows suit, particularly Roberts as the alpha-sister in the brood.  You can tell she's having an absolute ball during that ""catfish"" scene; I had a ball watching her.  A final nitpick: Letts seems to be a little confused as to whom constitutes the ""Greatest Generation"".  The play was produced in 2008; Vi cynically refers to her and her husband Shepard as part of that generation; however, Streep and Shepard are Baby Boomers.  When Streep as Vi harangues Roberts about how the people of her time placed inordinate importance on money in the manner of those who came of age during the Great Depression, it doesn't make any sense.  Perhaps Letts would've been advised to set his play in the 1970s or 80s, if he wanted to make a critique of ""Greatest Generation"" sentimentality.  In any case, the Boomers were contemptuous of money, at least until they grew up and became yuppies in the 80s.While I've been rather dismissive of the play's lack of originality, I do thank Letts for daring to suggest that Family with a capital F is not always the sacred institution our culture makes it out to be.  Many of these characters would be happier by being less encumbered by family, that's for sure -- and that is often the case for many people out there.  Whatever the play's faults, we really didn't need ""Steel Magnolias II"", and this movie definitely isn't that.  4 out of 5.",4,Family ham,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,3432,"['Tracy', 'Letts', 'famous', 'play', 'sufficient', 'enough', 'airing', 'out', 'director', 'John', 'Wells', 'enough', 'sensible', 'script-pruning', 'Letts', 'make', 'very', 'entertaining', 'picture', 'order', 'rubbernecking', 'horrible', 'accident', 'highway', 'cast', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bettered', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'nice', 'see', 'again', 'been', 'awhile', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'Oh', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'too', 'course', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'plays', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'Just', 'Age', 'Shakespeare', 'America', 'theatrical', 'Golden', 'Age', 'when', 'giants', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'Edward', 'Albee', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'dominated', 'boards', 'long', 'passed', 'history', 'never', 'return', 'so', 'get', 'derivative', 'works', 'August', 'Osage', 'County', 'several', 'Golden', 'Age', 'authors', 'Albee', 'particular', 'what', 'Big', 'Reveals', 'Shocking', 'Revelations', 'so', 'Letts', 'performed', 'actor', 'revival', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'clearly', 'had', 'huge', 'impact', 'Perhaps', 'first', 'problem', 'play', 'title', 'Look', 'call', 'August', 'Osage', 'County', 'Not', 'really', 'main', 'problem', 'just', 'so', 'familiar', 'cf', 'Golden', 'Age', 'playwrights', 'Letts', 'perhaps', 'knowing', 'sordid', 'default', 'mode', 'when', 'behavior', 'motivations', 'family', 'secrets', 'Perhaps', 'should', ""'ve"", 'called', 'play', 'OMG', 'Drama', 'Let', 'be', 'said', 'once', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'cleverer', 'material', 'wisely', 'role', 'Vi', 'max', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'whenever', 'slightest', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so', 'intelligent', 'understated', 'performance', 'would', 'expose', 'material', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Week', 'fundamentally', 'say', 'nothing', 'generating', 'misplaced', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'what', 'fact', 'terrific', 'villain', 'Vi', 'short', 'Most', 'cast', 'wisely', 'suit', 'particularly', 'Roberts', 'alpha-sister', 'brood', 'can', 'tell', 'having', 'absolute', 'ball', 'catfish', 'scene', 'had', 'ball', 'watching', 'final', 'nitpick', 'Letts', 'be', 'little', 'confused', 'whom', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'play', 'was', 'produced', '2008', 'Vi', 'cynically', 'husband', 'Shepard', 'part', 'generation', 'however', 'Streep', 'Shepard', 'are', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'When', 'Streep', 'Vi', 'Roberts', 'how', 'people', 'time', 'placed', 'inordinate', 'importance', 'money', 'manner', 'who', 'came', 'age', 'Great', 'Depression', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Perhaps', 'Letts', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'advised', 'set', 'play', '1970s', '80s', 'wanted', 'make', 'critique', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'sentimentality', 'case', 'Boomers', 'were', 'contemptuous', 'money', 'least', 'grew', 'up', 'became', 'yuppies', '80s.While', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rather', 'dismissive', 'play', 'lack', 'originality', 'do', 'thank', 'Letts', 'daring', 'suggest', 'Family', 'capital', 'F', 'not', 'always', 'sacred', 'institution', 'culture', 'out', 'be', 'Many', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'happier', 'being', 'less', 'encumbered', 'family', 'sure', 'often', 'case', 'many', 'people', 'there', 'Whatever', 'play', 'faults', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'II', 'movie', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'that', '4', '5']",N/A

The film opened with a quote &#8220;Life is too long&#8221; and this movie answered the question how that could be. What I can describe adequately is acting by every single person in this movie &#8211; superb. No film I have seen in recent memory can compare to this powerhouse of a cast. And it is not just the fact that they are part of it; no, everyone was in top acting form. If this movie (subject matter) or its characters were likable in the slightest it would win every Oscar.

Over the course of a few days, several essential truths about their lives are brought to the surface after years of denial with destructive consequences.  In terms of plot, John Wells' film has strong melodramatic echoes, most notably in the way familial skeletons in the cupboard are revealed so as to prevent any relationship between Little Charles Aiken (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Ivy Weston (Julianne Nicholson's).  What makes it compelling is the quality of the performances: as the vengeful matriarch Violet Weston, Meryl Streep spits vitriol in almost every speech - years of living an isolated existence with an uncommunicative spouse (Sam Shepard) have warped her nature.  Although racked with cancer, she demands no sympathy from her daughters; on the contrary, her belief in her impending death gives her license to tell the truth about their existences.  As her daughter Barbara, Julia Roberts begins by trying to match her mother for emotional strength, but discovers to her cost that this is a sure-fire way towards isolation.  Ewan McGregor, as her long-suffering spouse, eventually walks out on her,  The third daughter Karen (Juliette Lewis) appears to have been emotionally scarred at a young age; unable to cope with the demands of returning to her family, she departs permanently for Florida.  Adriano Goldman's cinematography appears to contrast the rolling Oklahoma landscape with the prison-like atmosphere of the family homestead, but as the film unfolds, we understand that the landscape itself is as much of a prison as the house.  With no other properties - or anything in terms of civilization - in sight of the house, there is not much hope of anyone escaping their miseries of existence.",3,Raw Melodrama About a Dysfunctional Family,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,1943,"['Set', 'wilds', 'Oklahoma', 'based', 'Broadway', 'success', 'AUGUST', 'OSAGE', 'COUNTY', 'lives', 'two', 'generations', 'strong-willed', 'women', 'paths', 'have', 'diverged', 'family', 'tragedy', 'together', 'one', 'more', 'course', 'few', 'days', 'several', 'essential', 'truths', 'lives', 'are', 'brought', 'surface', 'years', 'denial', 'destructive', 'consequences', 'terms', 'plot', 'John', 'Wells', 'film', 'strong', 'melodramatic', 'echoes', 'most', 'notably', 'way', 'familial', 'skeletons', 'cupboard', 'are', 'revealed', 'so', 'prevent', 'relationship', 'Little', 'Charles', 'Aiken', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Ivy', 'Weston', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'What', 'compelling', 'quality', 'performances', 'vengeful', 'matriarch', 'Violet', 'Weston', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'vitriol', 'almost', 'speech', 'years', 'living', 'isolated', 'existence', 'uncommunicative', 'spouse', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'have', 'warped', 'nature', 'racked', 'cancer', 'sympathy', 'daughters', 'contrary', 'belief', 'impending', 'death', 'license', 'tell', 'truth', 'existences', 'daughter', 'Barbara', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'trying', 'match', 'mother', 'emotional', 'strength', 'discovers', 'cost', 'sure-fire', 'way', 'isolation', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'long-suffering', 'spouse', 'eventually', 'out', 'third', 'daughter', 'Karen', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'have', 'been', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'young', 'age', 'unable', 'cope', 'demands', 'returning', 'family', 'permanently', 'Florida', 'Adriano', 'Goldman', 'cinematography', 'contrast', 'rolling', 'Oklahoma', 'landscape', 'prison-like', 'atmosphere', 'family', 'homestead', 'film', 'unfolds', 'understand', 'landscape', 'as', 'much', 'prison', 'house', 'other', 'properties', 'anything', 'terms', 'civilization', 'sight', 'house', 'not', 'much', 'hope', 'anyone', 'escaping', 'miseries', 'existence']",N/A

The crisis rallies the family of Violet and Beverly Weston: Their three grown daughters and significant others, and Violet's sister Mattie Fae and her husband and son. The extended family encounter that follows is a heart-wrenching raking over of old grudges, family secrets and new disputes. The result has been called a black comedy. This reviewer was thoroughly enthralled, but the sensation was more like watching a train wreck: You can't take your eyes off the movie, but you're pretty sure it isn't going to end well.The movie is an adaptation of a play, and most of the action takes place in and around an Oklahoma farm. The cast is stacked, and the acting is just awesome. Meryl Streep will surely rate an Oscar nomination as Violet, the aging, venomous and drug-addicted mother of the clan. Julia Roberts should also get an Oscar look as the oldest daughter, stepping up to take charge of the family crises while dealing with a brewing divorce and an unhappy teenage daughter of her own. Much of the plot and the dialogue are oriented around the female members of the family, but viewers are encouraged to watch for superbly nuanced supporting roles by Sam Shepard, Chris Cooper, Ewan McGregor, and Benedict Cumberbatch.There is a lot in this movie, but it won't be for everyone.

Although the film is described as being comedic, the heavy performances and the off beat cadence of the film create few if any laughs.

I know these people exist, this family could exist, and there are funny and compelling stories from them. The film's effort to deliver us that ends up a contrivance.

1684493,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00H7LINKE,FNDNreview,"[6, 10]","Typically, a Pulitzer Prize winning play adapted to film, starring Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep, sounds like an Oscar winning film in the making.  Well, I've got news for you!  Not even the undeniable skill of Streep and Roberts can automatically erase a troublesome plot full of yawn-worthy moments and childish behavior.  Obviously, you can't pick your family, but if you could, it's impossible to imagine anyone would want anything to do with the Weston family in August: Osage County.Directed by John Wells, most recently notable for developing Showtime's comedy drama, Shameless, August: Osage County stars Meryl Streep as Violet Weston, the drug addicted wife of her recently `gone missing' husband, Beverly (Sam Shepard).  Violet and Beverly have had a complicated marriage with one another - both being open about their substance abuse and individual flaws.  However, with Violet developing mouth cancer and spending the majority of her time ""stoned"" on prescription pills, Beverly hires a live-in housekeeper (prior to going missing), Johanna (Misty Upham).Distraught with the absence of her husband, Violet calls in the rest of her family - some of whom are local while others have relocated at a lengthier distance.  The first to arrive is her trusted, outspoken sister, Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale), her husband, Charles (Chris Cooper) - and some time later, their awkward, unemployed son, ""Little"" Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch).The eldest of their three daughters, Barbara (Julia Roberts), begrudgingly returns to town, along with her husband, Bill (Ewan McGregor), and their daughter, Jean (Abigail Breslin).  Regardless of appearance, Bill and Barbara are hardly happy, especially since the two quietly separated after failing to reconcile after Bill has an affair with a younger woman.  Eventually, several more family members make appearances, including Violet's two other daughters, Ivy (Julianna Nicholson), Karen (Juliette Lewis), and Karen's flashy fianc&eacute;, Steve (Dermot Mulroney).Finally, with the family all under the same roof, and the mystery of Beverly's disappearance solved, the real fireworks begin - and nearly everyone (at dinner) unloads their dirty laundry.  Violet, devastated and high on medication, takes her tirade to the extreme, prompting Barbara to take family matters into her own hands and attempt to sober-up her mother before she does any more damage.  But, with several secrets looming large over the family, it's quite possible they all might end up going in their separate directions.  The question becomes:  how much pain and how many secrets can one family possibly take?You see so many films in this day and age following the story of a dysfunctional family.  Needless to say, all families have their issues, but most of them don't advertise it for everyone else to witness.  That seems to be the general theme of August, as nearly all of these characters have something to keep from one another, and each of them goes to certain lengths to keep their individual secrets or failures quiet.  The Weston family operates much like a typical hierarchy where the people at the top (in this case the parents) pass down judgment for all of their children's wrongs.  The problem with that is the parents seem to have more issues within themselves than the children.  In fact, if these characters were more elaborate, you'd probably find out each and every one of them wound up in therapy at some point due to the unorthodox manner in which they were raised by their parents.Unfortunately, the interaction between Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts is about the only thing about this film that isn't in danger of putting you to sleep.  Both Streep and Roberts are worthy of acclaim from the very get-go, especially Streep who portrays this overbearing, controlling woman that is so out of control that she obviously requires help.  This is clearly one of the reasons Beverly hires someone to take care of her before he takes off - because he just doesn't want to deal with this woman anymore.  Enter Julia Roberts, who is nearly a mirror image to her mother - just without the major drug problem.The arguments and eventual brawl between Streep and Roberts highlights a movie that has a ridiculous amount of outstanding acting - all of which is incorporated into a story that seems far too long and uneventful.  Benedict Cumberbatch (who I swear is everyone you look these days) shows up without a British accent - so that's pretty noteworthy, too.  His character, in one of his more unconventional roles, becomes one of the centerpieces in the story, and what a disturbing, unforeseen centerpiece it is...Overall, August: Osage County (which is in Oklahoma if you were wondering) received a ridiculous amount of acclaim as a play, and that's not hard to imagine.  However, plays are restricted to a stage and keep the focus on the acting.  In the case of this film, the spectrum is much broader and grander in scale.  Moviegoers typically go to movies to be entertained, yet this film is lacking in that particular department.  This no doubt that Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts are superb in their portrayals, but even they can't make this film likeable.  There's too much drama, too much negativity, and very little positive aspects - which Chris Cooper's character even points out at one point.  Still, the message is not received very well in his speech as the secrets of what seems like another life unravels around these disillusioned individuals.  Lovers of drama should check this out, while everyone else should feel free to pass it over for something a little more uplifting.GRADE: CFNDNreview.com",3,"Streep, Roberts face-off in slow-paced

Not least of all Meryl Streep (IMO the greatest female actor alive today) who just has layers and layers and layers of ability.  But everyone else played their roles to a &#34;T&#34; as well.A powerful story about a family in Oklahoma getting together due to the death of the patriarch played by Sam Sheppard.  It has all the characters of a typical family - the drug addict (although this time played by the matriarch  Meryl Streep), the daughter who resents her mother, yet displays the same traits, the daughter who stays close to home to look after her parents and resents it, the daughter who is a mess and a ditz that has made bad choices all her life just to get as far away from the family as possible, etc, etc.All played masterfully.  It is a tragic story ultimately and shows what keeps family members at arms length from each other.  A very real story if not typical in so many ways (There's no such thing as a &#34;functional&#34; family).My only two criticisms is 1.  I thought Ewan McGregor's character over-reacted when Julia Robert's character DESERVEDLY slapped her daughter across the face for being a nasty, clueless, back-talking brat (the other &#34;b&#34; word would be more appropriate but the censors don't allow) especially considering what had just transpired in the story.  Is this where we have gotten in our country?  Slapping a child across the face when it is completely deserved, warrants a reaction as if you gave them a close-fisted upper cut that laid them out??  It's not child abuse in any way, shape, or form (a slap), regardless what armies of wisdom-less child development psychologists say.  Do it once or twice in a lifetime and you will make such a strong statement to your child that will net positive results in the future as an adult.2.  Didn't quite get the &#34;satisfaction&#34; of Julia Robert's character as she kept driving away at the end of the movie.  Was it because she felt free?  Free from what?  Her mother?  She stayed away from her all her adult life.  Her separated husband?  already free from him as well.  Her daughter?  That would prove a pretty horrible mother wanting to be separated from her 14 yr old daughter.  So, I was never clear on that.  Perhaps I missed something.So if you want a good drama performed to perfection by all players, I would highly recommend August: Osage County.",4,**** 1/2 Great Performances,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,2431,"['movie', 'just', 'filled', 'heavyweights', 'acting', 'field', 'Not', 'least', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'IMO', 'greatest', 'female', 'actor', 'alive', 'today', 'who', 'just', 'layers', 'layers', 'layers', 'ability', 'everyone', 'else', 'played', 'roles', '34', 'T', '34', 'well.A', 'powerful', 'story', 'family', 'Oklahoma', 'getting', 'together', 'due', 'death', 'patriarch', 'played', 'Sam', 'Sheppard', 'characters', 'typical', 'family', 'drug', 'addict', 'time', 'played', 'matriarch', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'daughter', 'who', 'mother', 'same', 'traits', 'daughter', 'who', 'close', 'home', 'look', 'parents', 'resents', 'daughter', 'who', 'mess', 'ditz', 'made', 'bad', 'choices', 'life', 'just', 'get', 'far', 'away', 'family', 'possible', 'etc', 'etc.All', 'played', 'masterfully', 'tragic', 'story', 'ultimately', 'what', 'family', 'members', 'arms', 'length', 'other', 'very', 'real', 'story', 'not', 'typical', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'such', 'thing', '34', 'functional', '34', 'family', 'only', 'two', 'criticisms', '1', 'thought', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'character', 'over-reacted', 'when', 'Julia', 'Robert', 'character', 'DESERVEDLY', 'slapped', 'daughter', 'face', 'being', 'nasty', 'clueless', 'back-talking', 'brat', 'other', '34', 'b', '34', 'word', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'censors', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'especially', 'considering', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'transpired', 'story', 'where', 'have', 'gotten', 'country', 'Slapping', 'child', 'face', 'when', 'completely', 'deserved', 'warrants', 'reaction', 'gave', 'close-fisted', 'upper', 'cut', 'laid', 'out', 'not', 'child', 'abuse', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'slap', 'regardless', 'what', 'armies', 'wisdom-less', 'child', 'development', 'psychologists', 'say', 'Do', 'once', 'twice', 'lifetime', 'will', 'make', 'such', 'strong', 'statement', 'child', 'will', 'net', 'positive', 'results', 'future', 'adult.2', 'Did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', '34', 'satisfaction', '34', 'Julia', 'Robert', 'character', 'kept', 'driving', 'away', 'end', 'movie', 'Was', 'felt', 'free', 'Free', 'what', 'mother', 'stayed', 'away', 'adult', 'life', 'separated', 'husband', 'already', 'free', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'would', 'prove', 'pretty', 'horrible', 'mother', 'wanting', 'be', 'separated', '14', 'yr', 'old', 'daughter', 'So', 'was', 'never', 'clear', 'Perhaps', 'missed', 'something.So', 'want', 'good', 'drama', 'performed', 'perfection', 'players', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'August', 'Osage', 'County']",N/A

1684498,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00H7LINKE,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Some years ago I myself played the role of Beverly Weston in a local community theatre production of AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY.  I mention this because I expected my knowledge of the playscript would inform my opinion of the film version when I finally got around to seeing it.  And it did.Both as a play and a film, AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY is the story of a dysfunctional family's implosion.  Noted poet and alcoholic Beverly Weston (Sam Shephard) begins the film by hiring household help in the form of Johnna (Misty Upham)--and then promptly commits suicide.  When his family gathers, they undergo a series of violent implosions that ultimately wrenches every relationship apart.  Most of the story centers on Beverly's wife, Violet (Meryl Streep), a drug addict battling oral cancer while alternately clinging to and pushing away her three daughters (Julia Roberts, Juliette Lewis, and Julianne Nicholson.)  The play is what you might call crowded with both characters and incident.  The film version runs two hours--about an hour less than the play--but it does its damndest to keep all the play's plotlines, and the result is not so much crowded as over-crowded.  The cuts in the script also have the effect of tearing away most of the play's dark humor and virtually all of its literary resonance, and too much is crammed into the last thirty minutes for it to be credible.If the film stumbles due to the way in which it is constructed, it floats magnificently in terms of production.  So much has been said about Meryl Streep's abilities that I need hardly mention them; I will say that the dynamics of her performance, the way she shifts in mood and tempo and tone, is astonishing.  Julia Roberts' prettiness tends to work against her in this film, but she too is very good, and indeed the overall cast is very, very memorable.  The cinematography and art direction are also very striking.  The DVD includes a number of bonuses, most particularly an audio commentary track and a ""making of"" documentary.  The bitterness of the play and the harshness of the characters will not appeal to everyone, not by a long shot, but I recommend it nonetheless.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,"""Nobody Slips Anything By Me""",1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,2169,"['years', 'played', 'role', 'Beverly', 'Weston', 'local', 'community', 'theatre', 'production', 'AUGUST', 'OSAGE', 'COUNTY', 'mention', 'expected', 'knowledge', 'playscript', 'would', 'inform', 'opinion', 'film', 'version', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'seeing', 'play', 'film', 'AUGUST', 'OSAGE', 'COUNTY', 'story', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'implosion', 'Noted', 'poet', 'alcoholic', 'Beverly', 'Weston', 'Sam', 'Shephard', 'film', 'hiring', 'household', 'help', 'form', 'Johnna', 'Misty', 'Upham', 'then', 'promptly', 'suicide', 'When', 'family', 'gathers', 'undergo', 'series', 'violent', 'implosions', 'ultimately', 'relationship', 'apart', 'Most', 'story', 'centers', 'Beverly', 'wife', 'Violet', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'drug', 'addict', 'battling', 'oral', 'cancer', 'alternately', 'clinging', 'pushing', 'away', 'three', 'daughters', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'play', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'crowded', 'characters', 'incident', 'film', 'version', 'two', 'hours', 'hour', 'less', 'play', 'damndest', 'keep', 'play', 'plotlines', 'result', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'crowded', 'over-crowded', 'cuts', 'script', 'also', 'have', 'effect', 'tearing', 'away', 'most', 'play', 'dark', 'humor', 'virtually', 'literary', 'resonance', 'too', 'much', 'crammed', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'be', 'credible.If', 'film', 'stumbles', 'due', 'way', 'constructed', 'magnificently', 'terms', 'production', 'So', 'much', 'been', 'said', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'abilities', 'need', 'hardly', 'mention', 'will', 'say', 'dynamics', 'performance', 'way', 'mood', 'tempo', 'tone', 'astonishing', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'prettiness', 'tends', 'work', 'film', 'too', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'overall', 'cast', 'very', 'very', 'memorable', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'striking', 'DVD', 'number', 'bonuses', 'most', 'particularly', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'making', 'documentary', 'bitterness', 'play', 'harshness', 'characters', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'recommend', 'nonetheless.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

I like movies with action, the use of guns, knives, and karate; doing all those moves I know I could do if my body would just agree to do them with me.  But it won&#8217;t, the punishment for living too long. I like men having sex with beautiful women, like Julia Roberts, but tastefully.  I rented this movie for my wife, not for me.But I watched it with her; after all she watches my movies with me and then laughs when I try to do what they do in the moves, only very poorly.  I will say Meryl Streep again shows why she is such a great actress.  She really gets into her part.  Meryl Streep disappeared and the old angry, bad mouthed bitch took her place.  She was brilliant.  Julia Roberts was also fantastic in her role as the distraught and under achieving daughter.  Both complimented each other like few actresses can.  Julia Roberts started as just another pretty face but has bloomed into an actress that can fit into any part.  She is still one of the most beautiful women in the movie business but she doesn&#8217;t rely on that.This story is about angry women, and neutered men.  The men are descent, they are the type of men that most women want but only the bitches get.  They work hard, they are gentle, and they understand.  I wanted to slap the crap out them for not coming down on their wives for acting like they do. I wouldn&#8217;t put up with it.  But in the movie, they do.So you have the Patriarch of the family who dies, and this dysfunctional family comes together to morn his loss, or actually their loss of a really nice man.  Thus incuses conversation after conversation airing out more dirty laundry than Chinese cleaner could ever handle.  There is drinking, drugs, infidelity, and insidious relations all over the place.  Unfortunately they occur before the movie starts and nothing is shown.  The conversations were glib, fast and you have to listen to catch it. The acting is first rate and the movie as far as my wife was concerned was good.  I guess she likes to see a family more dysfunctional than ours.This is a movie for women, many women will love it.  The men should watch it so they will see what a wonderful wife their wife actually is, unless one of the wives in the movie reminds him of his, I would get a divorce.  But that is not for me to say.

And in many ways that is the mood of this grim examination of a dysfunctional family living in the plains of Oklahoma, in this case baked by the August heat and the suicide death of the patriarch. John Wells directs what could possibly be one of the finest collections of contemporary actors of the day possible and the result is a stultifying, immensely well-crafted film. Gustavo Santaolla provides the atmospheric musical score that underlines the tension and provides breaks in the stifling displays of hate that fill this story.Violet Weston (Meryl Streep) has cancer of the mouth and is addicted to prescription pills and alcohol. She's a shrewish woman to deal with and her husband Bev (Sam Shepard) has finally had enough: he takes his boat out on the lake and commits suicide. Violet's family gathers including youngest daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson), middle daughter Karen (Juliette Lewis) with her new fianc&eacute;, the wealthy cannabis loving Steve (Dermot Mulrooney), eldest daughter Barbara (Julia Roberts) with her estranged husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) and their teenage daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin), and her fat sister Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale) with her husband Charlie (Chris Cooper) and son Little Charlie (Benedict Cumberbatch). A memorable funeral dinner brings out the secrets and the hostilities and the individual sicknesses of each member of this unsavory family - incest, adultery, lies, and other atrocities and the Weston women are forced to examine themselves and their lives whether they want to or not. Examining all of this gross mess of a family is Native American Johna (Misty Upham) who brings the only semblance of balance as the quiet maid serving these people.The story is grim, the play was even more grim, and it serves as an opportunity to examine how dysfunctional some families have become in this particular time in history.

1684515,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B00H7LINKE,Gryphonisle,"[0, 0]","My dear old mother, in years not as golden as she'd hoped, has taken a bitter streak.  Listening as she does to the far right end of the Media spectrum, she regularly parrots what she hears and vociferously denounces everything they tell her to, including and especially, Socialism.  Having had enough, I pointed out that, as she and Dad live on his pension and Social Security, they are, by definition, Socialists.  She refused to talk to me until I apologized for insulting her so horribly.It's been several years now...My mother, however enraged in her upper years though, has nothing on this mother grizzly and her brood.Meryl Streep once again goes over the top in her performance, although I've developed something of a hobby in noting when certain Streep characteristics pop through her characters----the way she points off to the right with her hand;  that explosive, deep-throated guffaw.  Here, playing a woman who's dying from mouth cancer, and who has been addicted to pills of various types for years, she alternates between an ill fitting black wig, and her own raggedly cut short graying blond hair, and aside from her widows weeds at the funeral, she rarely dresses in more than a house coat and night gown, so she alternates between a very weak self deception, and a dressed attitude that is as bleak in appearance as her prognosis.When &#34;Before Midnight&#34; came out, a few reviewers here compared the bicker fest between the two protagonists of that film to &#34;Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolfe&#34;, the epic Taylor-Burton brawl of the 1960's.  What an insult to Taylor and Burton's performance!  This film is much closer.  There are secrets.  There is regret.  Mom isn't just dying, she know's what went on behind her back, and she's also as selfish as they come.  Her own mother was a piece of work, at one point giving her a box with men's work boots, caked in mud and manure, for Christmas, when she had asked for a pair of girls boots she saw in a store---and then laughed at her reaction to it, for days.  Julia Roberts tries, as the eldest daughter to help her mother, to confront her addiction to pills, to draw her out on her rather odd reaction to her father's suicide, which happens early in the film.  But it's never quite clear if the three daughters are all merely the walking wounded or have agendas of their own.  Like a brush fire, the anger rises and falls, spreads rapidly and just as rapidly dies down, only to flare up, yet again, at some seemingly insignificant spark.Behind it all is the flat, sere, brooding, Oklahoma landscape, quietly enforcing the misery of the participants of this family meltdown.I haven't seen a film quite like this one since I can remember.  Today's films, like the aforementioned &#34;Before Midnight&#34; just can't seem to rise to the level of tenseness that they went to back when, probably because the cast members aren't usually as substantial as some of the old actors---the earlier generation, such as Burton and Taylor, went through Depression and World War, of course, and that tends to give you a perspective on life that several generations of stability and peace (when the nation isn't bullying some third world dictator it once supported)  don't quite provide.And, despite all the drama, like life, sometimes the dark moments have their funny sides...You'd probably have to be ready to sit down to a film like this, with so much angst and regret being hurled about, but I found it to be one of the best films I've seen in the past few years and I think many others will come to the same conclusion.",4,Whopper Of A Dysfunctional Family Drama,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,3585,"['dear', 'old', 'mother', 'years', 'not', 'as', 'golden', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'taken', 'bitter', 'streak', 'Listening', 'far', 'right', 'end', 'Media', 'spectrum', 'regularly', 'parrots', 'what', 'vociferously', 'denounces', 'everything', 'tell', 'including', 'especially', 'Socialism', 'Having', 'had', 'enough', 'pointed', 'out', 'that', 'Dad', 'live', 'pension', 'Social', 'Security', 'are', 'definition', 'Socialists', 'refused', 'talk', 'apologized', 'insulting', 'so', 'horribly.It', 'been', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'mother', 'however', 'enraged', 'upper', 'years', 'nothing', 'mother', 'grizzly', 'brood.Meryl', 'Streep', 'once', 'again', 'top', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'something', 'hobby', 'noting', 'when', 'certain', 'Streep', 'characteristics', 'pop', 'characters', 'way', 'right', 'hand', 'explosive', 'deep-throated', 'guffaw', 'Here', 'playing', 'woman', 'who', 'dying', 'mouth', 'cancer', 'who', 'been', 'addicted', 'pills', 'various', 'types', 'years', 'ill', 'fitting', 'black', 'wig', 'own', 'raggedly', 'cut', 'short', 'graying', 'blond', 'hair', 'aside', 'widows', 'weeds', 'funeral', 'rarely', 'more', 'house', 'coat', 'night', 'gown', 'very', 'weak', 'self', 'deception', 'dressed', 'attitude', 'bleak', 'appearance', 'prognosis.When', '34', 'Midnight', '34', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'reviewers', 'here', 'compared', 'bicker', 'fest', 'two', 'protagonists', 'film', '34', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolfe', '34', 'epic', 'Taylor-Burton', 'brawl', '1960', 'What', 'insult', 'Taylor', 'Burton', 'performance', 'film', 'much', 'closer', 'are', 'secrets', 'regret', 'Mom', ""n't"", 'just', 'dying', 'know', 'what', 'went', 'back', 'also', 'as', 'selfish', 'come', 'own', 'mother', 'was', 'piece', 'work', 'one', 'point', 'giving', 'box', 'men', 'work', 'boots', 'caked', 'mud', 'manure', 'Christmas', 'when', 'had', 'asked', 'pair', 'girls', 'saw', 'store', '-and', 'then', 'laughed', 'reaction', 'days', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'tries', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'help', 'mother', 'confront', 'addiction', 'pills', 'draw', 'out', 'rather', 'odd', 'reaction', 'father', 'suicide', 'early', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'three', 'daughters', 'are', 'merely', 'walking', 'wounded', 'have', 'agendas', 'own', 'brush', 'fire', 'anger', 'spreads', 'rapidly', 'just', 'as', 'rapidly', 'down', 'only', 'flare', 'up', 'yet', 'again', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'spark.Behind', 'flat', 'sere', 'brooding', 'Oklahoma', 'landscape', 'quietly', 'enforcing', 'misery', 'participants', 'family', 'meltdown.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'quite', 'one', 'can', 'remember', 'Today', 'films', 'aforementioned', '34', 'Midnight', '34', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'rise', 'level', 'tenseness', 'went', 'back', 'when', 'probably', 'cast', 'members', 'are', ""n't"", 'usually', 'as', 'substantial', 'old', 'actors', '-the', 'earlier', 'generation', 'such', 'Burton', 'Taylor', 'went', 'Depression', 'World', 'War', 'course', 'give', 'perspective', 'life', 'several', 'generations', 'stability', 'peace', 'when', 'nation', ""n't"", 'bullying', 'third', 'world', 'dictator', 'once', 'supported', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'provide.And', 'drama', 'life', 'sometimes', 'dark', 'moments', 'have', 'funny', 'sides', ""'d"", 'probably', 'have', 'be', 'ready', 'sit', 'down', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'angst', 'regret', 'being', 'hurled', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'think', 'many', 'others', 'will', 'come', 'same', 'conclusion']",N/A

Here comes Meryl Streep's 2013 entry, a film adaptation of Tracy Letts' Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning play of the same name; AND she has amazing company. This cast is to die for, even though the hateful characters they portray are ruthless, sordid and cruel. (This has been opened in a few select cities in order to qualify for this year's Academy Awards.)We admire:* Meryl Streep (""Hope Springs"") Violet is pure venom, even after we hear her life history and try to sympathize, she's just evil. Her drug of choice makes quite a pharmacy! In my opinion, Streep is given too full a rein: The dialog is adequate, we don't need all the histrionics as well. I saw this on stage and it was effective without the extra Methody tics.* Sam Shepard (""Safe House"") Beverly her husband, has had enough. He prefers scotch.* Julia Roberts (""Mirror Mirror"") Barbara was her daddy's favorite, but the apple didn't fall very far from the tree: her tongue is pretty sharp and she is an unyielding sort of woman.* Ewan McGregor (""Jack the Giant Slayer"") Bill is trying to understand the family dynamics so maybe he can understand his wife Barbara a little better.* Abigail Breslin (""Ender's Game"") Jean is only fourteen, but pretending to be a little more grown up sure can be fun!* Juliet Lewis (""The Switch"") Karen didn't come back to the old homestead after she went off to college and THIS time she has hit it lucky!* Dermot Mulroney (""Joline"") Steve is wealthy, drives a great car and Karen will marry him in Florida next January!* Margo Martindale (""Justified"") Mattie Fae is Violet's only sister. They both have secrets.* Chris Cooper (""The Muppets"") Charlie is the nicest in-law of the bunch (his prayers CAN go on a little too long), but if Mattie Fae doesn't button her lip she might not see her 39th wedding anniversary.* Benedict Cumberbatch (""The Fifth Estate"") is stunning as Little Charlie, Mattie Fae's son. This actor is brilliant! This time he's a shy, awkward young man who arrives late, plays the piano and sings.* Julianne Nicholson (""Boardwalk Empire"") is Ivy, the third daughter. She stayed around and took a lot of lip from her heartless mother.* Misty Upham (""Frozen River"") is Johnna, the young woman hired to help care for Violet. Johnna is the calm at the center of the storm but we LOVED it when she picked up that shovel! Born in Montana and raised south of Seattle, Misty has been working steadily since 2002.This story is about a toxic family and its chemical dependencies, both pills and alcohol that drive people to do what they do. It felt really good to watch Barbara fling all those prescription bottles at her mother's doctor, but I was clutching at straws because there are only three people in the entire story that I can remotely care about. (I always want someone to root for.)Do NOT see this film if you want relaxing entertainment but by all means SEE IT if you want to see brilliant acting!

I can't remember a more vile character than Vi (played by Meryl Streep), nor a more lost and vulnerable character than Barbara, played by Julia Roberts. Each actor in the ensemble seems perfectly cast for his/her role. The family of 3 daughters comes together to support their cancer-stricken, drug addicted mother after the suicide of their father. As families always do, they bring up old hurts and unmet needs, and each knows exactly how to inflict the maximum pain on each other. However in ""Osage County"" the art of speaking one's mind, liberally laced with profanity, is elevated to a new level that is uncomfortable to witness. The caring and loving remarks were so infrequent, that I couldn't even imagine why they bothered to get together at all.The dinner scene, which apparently required 18 takes, is the core of the plot, where all characters are together at once. This is where the family dynamics really play out, and allows each actor to display their acting chops. The ending seemed so incomplete and abrupt that I'm still wondering ""what happened next""?  I guess that's a screen writer's way of making sure that the film stays with you.The special features on the DVD included an interview with the director who said that many people had told him that their families were just like this one.

His funeral brings the family together to their home- in Osage County Oklahoma.The story unfolds as the tensions amongst the family members come to the surface. The focal point of the tensions is the matriarch of the family, played by Meryl Streep brilliantly. She certainly puts the ""vile"" into Violet (the name of her character).Relationships within the family are dysfunctional. The story focuses on the relationships, and the brewing tensions.

I heard the criticism before I saw it, that it was a concept better suited to the stage, but that's nonsense. Tracy Letts who wrote the Pulitzer Prize winning play pens this screenplay and since I didn't see it on Broadway I am happyto see his work any way I can. The premise is this, the patriarch is an alcoholic who disappears and is later found dead of an apparent suicide. The extended family reunites at the home of he and his angry, pill addled wife and Southern gothic chaos ensues. There are deep resentments, lies, bitter childhoods, and addictions galore all of which build until they explode. At it's center is violet, the pill popping matriarch is like a vortex only meaner. Her both subtle and dramatic changes in mood are so well crafted by Streep that it is a master class in acting, it's cliche but so true in this case. Just when you think all of this venom is spewed because she is high, she sobers up(not by her own choice) and the machinations become more subtle but just as vicious.Another star turn is given byJulia Roberts, I never knew she could be as good as she is as in this as Violet's daughter Barbara.She is as stubborn as her mother if not more and has just been left by her husband for a younger woman. The two go at it like battering rams winding up on the floor wrestling over a bottle of pills. Every actor rises to the occasion of these brilliant words. Another standout is Violet's sister Mattie Fay played by the brilliant stage and screen actress Margo Martindale.

But if you like amazing performances that leave you shaking your head at one moment and laughing out loud at another, then you need to watch this film.First, this movie is not about Meryl Streep's character, Violet, and how she strong arms everyone with her wicked tongue. Yes, she does that but the movie is not about her. It's actually about Julia Robert's character, Barbara, who is Violet's daughter, and how she comes to realize over the course of a week with her crazy family that she is just like her mother. For better or worse - they are two peas in the same pod.For Babara to come to that epiphany, she first has to endure the disappearance of her father, the disclosure of a long buried family secret, her young teen daughter being hit on by her sister's fiance' (played by Dermot Mulroney), battling with her mother's addiction to pain killers as a result of cancer treatment, and the open admission that her husband (Ewan McGregor) has left her for a younger woman. Through it all, there are tons of cursing and &#34;truth telling&#34; as Meryl Streep's character calls it and it happens with brutal and dark depictions.There are some hilarious scenes during the film but you should not for one moment think this is a comedy. Instead, we watch with a growing sense of foreboding as Julia Robert's character transforms from a loving mom and wife (as portrayed in the car scene when they arrive at the family home) into a snarky and unhappy person trying to hold everything together while the world around her falls apart. Her sisters are immature, her husband is a flake, her mother has terminal cancer, and her daughter walks around in her own little teenage bubble.Now some people think that the end suggests that Barbara (Julia Roberts) leaves her mother alone in the house and is finally happy.

Osage is no exception.  The occasional glimpse of a field or a highway is to remind us that this play is now a movie.  Meryl Streep plays an angry, pill-addicted, hostile old woman who enjoys alienating her whole family by belittling them and humiliating them when they all gather to mourn their patriarch, who presumably killed himself because he could no longer stand his hurtful spouse.  At the funeral dinner table the mother faces them all off.  No doubt it takes acting skills, with which Streep and Julia Roberts and the whole cast are blessed, to portray the tortured and unhappy members of this dysfunctional family.  However in the end, when the mother is left alone, probably crying to herself, &#34;Now why did all those horrible people abandon a kindly, loving person like me?&#34; we are unmoved, saying &#34;So what?&#34;  The movie is somewhat sterile; it doesn't evoke much if any of our sympathy.

Even though I grew up in Texas from age 3 and learned the Texas style of niceness, I strongly identify with the qualities of Okies in this film &#8211; a kind of tough ability to survive and a teasing of those taking themselves too seriously - both of which sometimes manifest as harsh meanness.

This movie gives you an insight into a family with such dysfunction at so many levels, I couldn't help but see some of those elements that exist in a lot of families.Meryl Streep is one of the best actresses of her generation and again she proves that she can bring the best out of any character when just handed a script and told to go to it.  She does an excellent job at the role of the drugged out loud mouthed mom with a lot of skeletons in the closet.  You actually love to hate her but at the same time feel sorry for her as well.  Brilliantly acted on Streep's part.Julie Roberts is also solid in her role as Barbara, one of the daughters, who like most in the family have their secrets as well.  Roberts and Streep's chemistry is obvious and both play off the other's characters very well.The supporting cast is also a who's-who of well known good quality actors, which helps to lift this movie to better heights.  The movie does plod along like a slow moving train at times (but as my wife said, it is that type of movie), until it reaches its boiling point where all the dysfunction boils over.  Although the movie's ending was a bit unsatisfying at least to me.  But maybe that's the point though, to show that not everything can be fixed in 2 hours of story telling.Overall, a decent movie to watch with an ok plot.

Taken from an original screenplay by Tracey Letts (Killer Joe) based on his stage play, &#8220;August: Osage County&#8221; is something everyone should see.Another tour-de-force performance by Meryl Streep (Doubt, The Hours) once again as she proves she has more layers and colors in her performances and just when you thought you&#8217;ve seen her do it all, she&#8217;s back again on screen doing something new and fresh. As the Matriarch of the family coming together for her husband&#8217;s death, Meryl&#8217;s character is struggling with drug addiction, cancer and all with the moral fiber of a cotton ball. Her oldest, and most bitter daughter, is poignantly played by Julia Roberts (Peter Pan, Pretty Women). Julia and Meryl have some amazing scenes together and watching them fight as mother and daughter is electrifying!Julia also has some incredibly real and funny, but heartbreaking, family issues/scenes with her husband played dutifully by Ewan McGregor (Big Fish, Moulin Rouge). His innocents and passion are clearly what sharpen both the relationship between him and Julia but also their daughter played by Abigale Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine, Signs).Now another stand out and amazing performance comes from Chris Cooper (The Muppets, American Beauty) as the husband of Margot Martindale (The Millers, Million Dollar Baby) and the father of Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek: Into Darkness, Sherlock). Chris has one of the most amazing scenes defending his son from Margot and it will literally lift your spirits and make you angry at the same time. Benedict does some amazing shy and persecuted acting with an emotional layer I have never seen him do before. They all are really amazing.Julianne Nicholson (The Red Road, Boardwalk Empire) plays the middle sister with a very private secret that will literally shake the family tree apart (leaf by leaf) once it&#8217;s revealed. Her sister, and the youngest of the three girls is played by Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, What&#8217;s Eating Gilbert Grape) who is more than a little &#8216;out of it&#8217; as well as introducing her new (much older) fianc&eacute; to the family who is played by Dermot Mulroney (My Best Friend&#8217;s Wedding, Big Miracle).By the way, Meryl&#8217;s husband, although a small role, was subtly, yet masterfully played by Sam Sheppard (Simpatico, Fool For Love). He is the catalyst for many events in this film.This movie was very real and visceral in all the performances but the amazing dynamics of Meryl, Julia and Chris are just what set this family film on its ear. This film has so much real dialogue and actions, that if you are like most of us, you will literally feel like you are watching your own dysfunctional family right on the screen. &#8220;August: Osage County&#8221; is an amazing film.

Sadly...it probab;y represents 1/3 of American families, only we dont get paid by Hollywood.  Cudos for nobody getting beat up or any violence. Noce to see  a movie can be made without any today.As a man, I would have to say that, if I watched this flick with a new guy I recently met at the office that I liked a lot, this movie could be the &#34;test&#34; to see if I could ever have any deep or uncomfortable conversations with him. If the guy didnt like the movie, or at least have a lot, I mean a lot... to say about it, then it would be a good indicator that he and I could never become close as friends. Because friends , even men, occasionally have to dig deep to the bone once in a while and if you get that old &#34;it aint nothing&#34; kinda attitude or &#34;Jeez, these people need to go out more often(which they do)&#34; kinda remarks...you are not talking to a very deep person. ......because like it or not, it is a very deep movie. Streep's drug addiction was made a najor part of the movie but in reality, this whole movie might not have been any differe nt WITHOUT the drugs. As Streep says...&#34;Drugs dont talk, people do.&#34; 3 stars for the entertainment value. 5 if your using it as a test to find out about how someone handles or would handle stress. (Maybe marriage advisers should use this as a litmus test)I bet out of 100 men watching this, 50 would start getting antsy 1/2 the way thru, the other half something would come out of them from their own childhood and  a  golden remark would just fly out. Its not a mans movie to be sure...but its definitely npt one of those sappy womens cry at the end films either. In fact...... the end may be the saddest endimng ever made in the last decade....IF  you can get it.  I wouldnt mind marrying a woman who could talk to me for 10 minutes on this film. Yuh gotta have some back bone in your soul to not get uncomfortable or bored after its 1/2 over. The only thing I have no idea is why they put an American Indian care taker in the movie of which  without here there would be no noticable difference.  Even tho not a  womens movie, its a great film for a bunch of women from the office  who want to get to know each other better. This film will give you all something to talk about after its over...thats for sure.  We need a lot more movies like this and  a lot less Sopranos and Breaking Bad (and I like both) if our children are going to see what real life is like on screen. 50 yrs ago our mothers werent allowed to see what went on behind closed doors. Now that weve allowed it, everyone wants to still see Al PACINO say &#34;Say hello to my little friend.&#34;  I dont get it. There must be more movioes like this made more often or America will lose its values.",4,There is no story. Its a screen test to see how Streep and Roberts would work together.

1684609,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00H7LINKE,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","One of the best things to come out of movies is when you watch one that involves family problems. The reason it's great is that suddenly all of the problems you might have with your own family seem inconsequential compared to those of the characters onscreen. The downside of this is that you find yourself sitting there watching people with tremendous character issues for 2 hours which in itself can be a bit daunting.AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY is about the Weston family. It opens with patriarch Beverly Weston (Sam Shepherd) interviewing a possible live in nurse to take care of his wife Violet (Meryl Streep). Violet is prone to throwing tantrums and taking more meds than she needs when it comes to her cancer of the mouth problem. Beverly then does what most of us would consider after having to be involved with this family: he commits suicide. This brings back the entire family for the funeral.First off is Violet's sister and her husband, Mattie Fae Aiken (Margo Martindale) and Charlie (Chris Cooper). Mattie is one of those smiling faces and larger than life persons that capture a room but always have a hidden sadness deep inside. Charlie is the friendliest person in the film, always having a good word to say but not quite sure how he fits into this group. Also on hand is daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson), the one daughter who stayed near home to help but who hides a secret that you won't see coming near the end.Coming home for the funeral is Barbara (Julia Roberts), her father's favorite but a strong willed woman much like her mother. Barbara left the confines of this family but has problems of her own at present with her husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) having an affair which has led to their separation. Along with them is their daughter, Jean (Abigail Breslin), your stereotypical troubled teen who finds fault in both her parents.Next to arrive home is Karen (Juliette Lewis), the free spirit of the three sisters. Karen has her own faults, moving from man to man in the hopes of finding happiness and yet always picking the worst males possible. Her latest is Steve (Dermot Mulrooney), a sports car driving pot smoking wheeler dealer. If you don't see where his character is heading early on then you're not paying attention. It is so over handed that to say its obvious is in itself obvious.The last member to arrive is cousin Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch), son of Charlie and Mattie Fae. Little Charles is incredibly shy and withdrawn but having lived his life around this family would have do that to you. Constantly put down by his mother, loved by his father, Little Charles also finds himself in a bit of a fix before the end of the film.With the stage set we experience what is happening in this household as each member arrives and eventually they return from the funeral for the family dinner. Violet is the most vicious of mothers seen on screen in some time. She cajoles and pokes at the wounds in each of her family members, provoking them all in hopes of their returning her attacks. When they do the most explosive moments of the film show themselves. Each one edges us closer and closer to the moment when some will strike back, some will reveal themselves to be more than anyone expected, some will realize they are more like Violet than they had hopes and all secrets will be revealed.Based on the stage play this movie unfold like one with little time spent moving from location to location. Instead most of the film plays out in the Weston home where bitter and damaging history has played out in the past leaving everyone with scars they carry with them for life. The home itself is a character, displaying the time worn walls that hold secrets of a family that offered little love and much damage to one another. The film only offers three sympathetic characters from start to finish: Charles, Little Charles and Johnna, the nurse Beverly hired. The rest are all people you might recognize as the family members you most try to avoid at reunions.Roberts and Streep were both nominated for best actress this past year but I don't think either should have qualified. It's another case of those who seem the most flawed and loud get the attention while understated performances are ignored. Had either shown a character here that you had some sympathy for at some point it might have been different. As offered neither grows or changes, instead simply retaining their dislikable selves.If your idea of entertainment is listening to actresses yell at one another, tossing out the GD expletive as if it were water and seeing a family self destruct before your eyes then you'll want to watch this one non-stop. If that's not your cup of tea then avoid it. Maybe you might want to watch it once to feel good about your own family but my guess is it will be tedious at best for everyone else except those trendy people who find depth in destruction of the family.",2,DYSFUNCTIONAL ISN'T THE WORD,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,4906,"['One', 'best', 'things', 'come', 'movies', 'when', 'watch', 'one', 'family', 'problems', 'reason', 'great', 'suddenly',

1684614,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B00H7LINKE,M. Bullions,"[39, 48]","I don't think I've seen a film competing in the Oscar race this year with just as many powerhouse performances as ""August: Osage County."" Every actor is cast perfectly in a film where each character is well written, although the movie itself is basically an abridged version of the stage show. On stage, ""August"" is a night of three acts and three and a half hours. On screen, it's just about two hours long. Scenes were shortened, some were cut, but its essence remains.Tracy Letts, writer of the stage show, wrote this film adaptation as well. It appears that he didn't mind cutting the film down considerably for the screen. The film is able to avoid becoming a ""greatest hits"" version of the play. Yet it can be called an abridged version of the stage show, but that's not quite right either. It's its own animal. It can't help but feel stagy but I certainly don't think that detracts from the experience.""August: Osage County"" tells the story of the Weston family. Three sisters - Barbara (Julia Roberts), Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) and Karen (Juliette Lewis) come back home after their alcoholic, yet soulful and brooding father Beverly (Sam Shepherd) goes missing. Their mother, Violet (Meryl Streep) has basically ruined each one of these girls' lives in one way or another. She has cancer of the mouth, but is constantly smoking like a chimney. Each character has their own story going on. Letts keeps just enough of each character in this condensed adaptation to make it feel like everybody is well-examined and written. I still wish it was the same three and a half hours that the play was, but I understand why that wasn't an option.When a film contains numerous stellar performances like this, a complaint about the running time hardly means anything. Meryl Streep continues to prove that she can do no wrong. You've never seen her play a character like Violet Weston. She's a serial killer, and words are her bullets. When she goes on ""truth-telling"" rampages, no one is safe. She gives a performance that might remind you of Elizabeth Taylor's classic turn in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"". A great woman whose moral and mental health is very much in question, who is biting, clever and ruthless. A twenty-minute long dinner table scene (which is one of the play's three acts) is absolutely terrific, because this is where everything begins to disintegrate.Julia Roberts surprised me as well. She's done a few incredible dramatic performances, but I mainly think of her as a rom-com actress. She has a meaty, complicated role in Barbara Weston, and she nails it. Other standouts include Julianne Nicholson, who I'm shocked isn't a bigger star than she is. Margo Martindale is also fantastic as Aunt Mattie Fay. But the truth is there's not a bad performance to be found in all of ""August: Osage County"".One thing you must know before seeing this film is that it's absolutely no comedy. Its trailers depict it as a lighthearted family comedy, and that's not really true at all. It's potent as both a drama and a comedy, however it's not lighthearted in the slightest. These are miserable, miserable people. It's relatable in so many ways, but you can remember, hopefully, that you and your family could be worse.Tracy Letts clearly loves manic, cynical people.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[3, 5]","In many ways, AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY, Tracy Letts&#8217; outstanding Pulitizer Prize-winning play, is reminiscent of the works of Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, William Inge and Edward Albee, in that it involves a family get-together of one sort or another in which long hidden, dark secrets are revealed that, ultimately, destroys the family.Indeed, just about any viewer can find a character in these dramas that reminds one of their own families.In Letts&#8217; drama, directed by John Wells, the dysfunctional Oklahoma clan comes together when the patriarch (Sam Shepard) disappears and is later discovered to be a suicide.  He leaves behind a drug-addicted, strident wife (Meryl Streep), who is suffering from mouth cancer, and three grown daughters: Julia Roberts, Juliette Lewis and Julianne Nicholson, none of whom seem to have their lives going on the right track.Other family members include Margo Martindale (as Streep&#8217;s sister), Chris Cooper (Margo&#8217;s husband) and Benedict Cumberbatch as their &#8220;loser&#8221; son.  There&#8217;s also Ewan McGregor (as Roberts&#8217; estranged husband) and Abigail  Breslin as their daughter, plus Dermot Mulroney (as Lewis&#8217; latest boy friend) and Misty Upham as the recently hired Native American housekeeper&#8230;and probably the most likeable and emotionally grounded character in the group.Although it could have used a tad more humor, Tracy Letts&#8217; dialogue is sharp; his many characters fascinating, as their emotional layers are peeled and shocking, unforgivable family skeletons come to light.Wells has done a commendable job in opening up this stage play, which is brought to life by one of the finest all-star casts assembled in recent memory.  Streep, Roberts, Cooper and the rest of these players are at the top of their game.Extras on the Blu-Ray disc from Anchor Bay Entertainment include feature and deleted scenes commentary by director John Wells and cinematographer Adriano Goldman, a &#8220;Making of&#8221; featurette and a featurette on writing with Tracy Letts.

1684624,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00H7LINKE,M. Oleson,"[97, 103]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.Set in dusty, sweltering Oklahoma, director John Wells, using an adapted screenplay by Tracy Letts, provides the viewer with the dysfunctional family of the year.  Early on we meet the patriarch, Beverly Weston (Sam Shepard) who is interviewing a woman to care after his cancer-stricken wife Violet (Meryl Streep).  Bev is an alcoholic and Vi is a drug addict.  Her mouth cancer causes severe burning pain so she has buckets of pills which she's happy to take even if she wasn't in pain.When Bev turns up missing, Vi calls her 3 daughters and her sister to come help find him.  One of the side effects of the narcotics is that they take Vi to a new level of nastiness.  And she's one nasty women even when sober.  Her oldest daughter Barbara (Julia Roberts) comes from Denver with her estranged husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) and their daughter, Jean (Abigail Breslin).  Juliette Lewis plays daughter Karen who brings her fianc&eacute; Steve (Dermot Mulroney).  Julianne Nicholson is the other daughter Ivy who is having an affair with her cousin Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch).  Vi sister Mattie (Margo Martindale) is nearly a match for Vi in terms of her foul mouth, but at least she's sober most of the time.The film's centerpiece is the verbal violence zinged between Vi and Barbara.  Frankly, it is almost shocking to hear the vitriol coming from Roberts and Streep as these characters.  I suspect they tossed out more F-bombs in this movie than they have in their cumulative careers.  Some of it is uncomfortably funny I admit, but his film is hardly a comedy, even a black comedy.  I was reminded of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" from 1966 where Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton go at it in front of their 2 innocent guests.  But here we have a houseful of guests and verbal grenades are tossed in all directions.As the family disintegrates before our eyes, secrets long kept surface which complicates the situation even further.

As the movie opens (pre-credits), we see Beverly (played by Sam Shepherd) interviewing a live-in housemaid to help him deal with Violet (played by Meryl Streep), who has mouth cancer and pops pain medicine like it's candy. The opening credits then roll to the tune of Eric Clapton's &#34;Lay Down Sally&#34; (which will play a few more times in the movie, it is Vi's favorite song ever). Not long afterwards, Bev goes missing, and the three daughters Barbara (played by Julia Roberts), Karen (played by Juliette Lewis) and Ivy (played by Julianne Nicholson) and their husbands/significant others are all coming to Osage County, OK. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: ah yes, the performances! Let's start with this: as big a fan as I am of Meryl Streep, I think she is way off course in this one, with her performance so borderline over the top that it almost ruins the movie, You can just feel the ACTING dripping off the screen. On multiple occasions Meryl's character Vi dishes out zingers left and right that just end up hurting the people she supposedly loves, but Vi insists that &#34;I'm just truth telling&#34;. The big surprise for me instead was Julia Richards, now 46, and possibly turning in her most mature movie role in her career, &#34;Erin Brockovich&#34; notwithstanding. At one point we see her character Barbara getting into an argument with her husband, who claims this place is a madhouse, to which she snorts back &#34;This madhouse is my home!&#34;, ha! Other noteworthy performances are from Chris Cooper, perhaps the &#34;sanest&#34; guy in the entire dysfunctional family, and Abigail Breslin (yes, the erstwhile little girl in &#34;Little Miss Sunshine&#34;) , playing the 14 yr. daughter of Julia Robert's character.The movie opened today here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to go see it. When I arrived for the late matinee showing at the local art-house theatre, there was a line around the block, literally, so I got in line and asked &#34;is there something special going on?&#34;, but no, it was simply &#34;August: Osage County&#34; opening! The screening was PACKED, tilting heavily towards toward seniors for some reason (not that there's anything wrong with that). Bottom line: at times the movie is highly enjoyable, and emotionally HEAVY, but at other times the acting is so OBVIOUS and almost over the top, that it really detracts from the movie.

If you think your family has troubles, 'you Ain't seen nothing yet'.The film opens as Beverly, the patriarch, played by Sam Shepard is talking about the family to the new housemaid he has hired. Bless this woman ,she knows not what she walks into. We have Violet, Bev's wife, played by Meryl Streep, in another magnificent role. She is the kind of woman you never want to meet. We Learn her mother was mean,vindictive and abusive, and that describes Vi to a 'T'. The entire family comes home when the father goes missing. Daughters, Barbara, played by Julia Roberts; Julianne Nicholson, plays Ivy,and Juliette Lewis plays Karen. This family is hard to take. Barbara, her husband played by Ewen McGregor and her daughter, come home and all is not well with this portion of the family. Margo Martindale, who plays Mattie Faye, Vi's sister, is almost as mean and nasty. Her husband played by Chris Cooper has some real balls, but too late. Benedict Humberbatch plays the son, whipped and beaten into shape by Mattie Faye.The film certainly captures your interest. One nasty scene after another where we get to know them all. The acting is so superior, it keeps the film intact, and us glued to the screen. One thing after another as the family disintergrates and falls apart.

1684661,A1MMH9EE7HUCGC,B00H7LINKE,Rebeccah,"[2, 3]","The acting was incredible, but the &#34;f-bomb&#34; was entirely over-used.  Even among some of the most dysfunctional individuals and families in real life, the f-bomb is not necessarily used this much, or not at all.The frequency of its use in the script gives the impression that to be really successful in the film industry, a successful portrayal via base verbal drama is mandatory by using this exaggerated, over-worked verbal format; that a dysfunctional and/or unhealthy family unit simply MUST be portrayed as using rough and heavily repeated f-bomb language &#8212; this limited thinking, limited vision in writing, yields limited, mediocre art.Likewise, it begins to give the impression the writer believes the story will not stick in our minds, or that the audience will not 'stick it out' in viewing, if the writer doesn't, essentially, rely on this extensive language 'drama'...to keep us watching?  NOT.Some of the shrewdest, most manipulative, intellectually cunning, flat-out dysfunctional family members, co-workers, neighbors, etc., we all encounter in real life, whether or not under the influence of any one or number of substances, can and often do inflict their pain and chaos without one drop of foul language; i.e., you don't realize you've been intellectually and emotionally 'hit' until their smooth-talking words are out, until a slick deed is done.Via stage or screen, this level of 'dysfunctional sophistication' requires and, in fact, deserves the use of a far greater, more refined work in portrayal of personalities, motive, of what is happening in the heads of the characters being portrayed.  These actors are phenomenal, as they perform here before the more restrictive confines of the camera lens (versus the difference in stage); yet the actors could and should have been far better tapped to better utilize their already proved, captivating talents and acting capabilities.In contrast, it would be refreshing to see this same level of 'intellectual, emotional, and social dysfunction' portrayed in this same family without the constant eye-rolling-drama CRUTCH of 'cheap-shock' language usage every other sentence.  It's no secret it takes real talent and professional experience to both write and perform, to portray family constellations, relationships, and complex human interaction.  Most of us have observed, heard, or perhaps been a part of such family scenes, yet this continual base language is an exaggeration, when used by all or key roles with every breath -- the viewing public knows this.Much of the movie did accomplish the greater reliance on just good acting via the great talents of a fantastic cast; however, the acting talent is better portrayed and appreciated among the supporting cast, in the secondary family member roles, where 'cheap-shock' f-bomb usage and language seemed much less.  The main actors were, as always, tops in their usual work.  But, sadly, their professional abilities become quickly OVERSHADOWED with the writing crutch of constant 'cheap-shock' language overuse.This is easily a five star production.  Yet, for what seems to be lazy 'word-work' by the play write in his original stage play (a well-known, authentic, phenomenal hit), and in his transferring it here to a movie script, it is necessarily reduced to a four-star rating.Some language is fine, realistic, expected, but this much is a disappointing, elementary reliance on unrealistic, shallow drama.  If you find that a writer persists in 'painting the walls with it', it then diminishes the fine acting skills of top professional performers, instead of further magnifying and challenging the actors' fine-tuned skills, which we've come to crave and appreciate.  When a writer needs to add coat after coat of the crap, it is an insult to you, the viewer, which suggests you can't think for yourself and not lose interest in his work without painting his script with layers of tiresome, empty language drama.The best writing will challenge the best actors to develop in their work, to stretch, to effectually reveal their character in a challenging new role.  Perhaps some contemporary viewers are content to pay good money to passively watch their personal life experience acted out on stage/screen; or perhaps the curious and naive are content to come away thinking, in error, that this is how it is, this is how it's 'done'.  And, perhaps this is a reflection of what seems a growing inability, or disinterest, in a higher level of 'audience thought participation', a dumbing-down of sorts; a possible reflection of a growing inability or disinterest in a higher level of entertainment skills; skills that would provide performance at a level of sophistication that could more effectually portray the realistic, even dangerous levels that authentic dysfunction can take on.Bottom line, despite great acting, great set, all the top work that went into production, plus a bit of comedic work subtly woven through various scenes, the film doesn't respect the audience OR the actors at a higher, more sophisticated level above this film's base writing &#8212; this production, utilizing top talent, simply reduces, rather than amplifies, both the viable story and the actors&#8217; portrayal of their characters.  What a shame to see these great, talented actors reduced to mere verbal drama, flooded with lower-level script language, so beneath their capabilities; in contrast to allowing them to brilliantly act out their characters' colorful, spicy, crazy personalities, foibles, denials, and life-failings &#8212; take away the language and you are forced, like a gifted mime, to stretch, to produce quality &#8212;quality ART!Would love to see other insightful, life-experienced, creative writers rework this story/theme for a deeper, richer, more powerful viewer experience, well beyond the shallows of 'cheap-shock' writing -- both audience and cast deserve better.",4,...well...,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,5915,"['acting', 'was', 'incredible', '34', 'f-bomb', '34', 'was', 'entirely', 'over-used',

We're both glad we went.The high-level summary of the plot is that there's not much plot.  The family patriarch dies and for the next two hours we see the aftermath as the family comes together to grieve (or not) and to dig up old grievances against each other.  I don't really need to tell you much more than that because I think on some level everyone has lived through or seen this situation.  The only variation is the extent to which your own family gets along.  Suffice to say that this family most assuredly does NOT.The real highlight of the movie lies in the characters themselves and of course with the acting.  With a cast like this it is thoroughly impossible to be anything but immaculately portrayed.  This collection of characters features all the most delightful archetypes of dysfunction:  The harpy shrew of a matriarch who is flawlessly selfish, combative and conniving, the daughter(s) who escaped her and hopped from man to man for validation, the in-law who tries to feel up the teenager and of course everyone seems to have cheated with someone else.  The full range of human frailty and family dysfunction is on display.In the end this was a wonderfully real movie.  Some reviewers have criticized this movie as 'over the top' and unbelievable and I assure you that it absolutely is NOT.  This sort of thing happens every day and if anything it's slightly less dramatic than reality.

Included in the search are the three adult daughters of Bev and Violet. Without trying to ruin it, I will say that Bev never returns and the family has to deal with the very difficult, cantankerous Violet. She is one mean woman, a bully really, and as the story unfolds, the viewer gets a glimpse as to why she is the way she is. Julia Roberts plays the eldest daughter, Barbara, who comes out from the West with her husband and daughter. There is trouble in her relationships as well and we begin to see parallels between Violet and Barbara surface even though Barbara appears to detest Violet.The acting is strong and excellent, and the story is intriguing, as layers of the family are unpeeled to explain Bev's decision to leave. I can see how August: Osage County would make for a great play. But as a film, it leaves something to be desired. So much more of a story can be told on film than on stage but, being what I'm guessing is a pretty literal adaptation, the movie is limited to basically one single setting, the home of Bev and Violet, and one single week in the characters' lives. The dark, stiflingly hot house is a metaphor, however, and it's understandable that we don't get more of a before-and-after view of the characters except through their own words.It's worth a watch to see some very good performances. But I've never disliked Meryl Streep more. Her character is pretty despicable, making her hard to stomach, even for a viewer sitting on a couch a thousand miles away from Osage County.

It is the most toxic verbal explosion I have ever seen and if you do decide to view it, be ready to hit the deck at any given time.  Violet Weston (Meryl Streep) has an uncanny ability to spew targeted vitriol in more directions than can be counted, and now with her family all present, one always wonders which way is next. Or should I say, towards whom?Beverly (Sam Shepard) drinks profusely, and adds that it is ""a little paragraph in our marriage contract"", and not a decision of which he is entirely comfortable with that they have chosen these paths in life.  These two have led a life of dysfunction and conflict, while raising and involving their three children.  His wife Vi has oral cancer, suffering  a burning and painful condition in her mouth (which I found succinctly metaphoric) so is taking an enormous amount of pills.  The list is so extremely long that when repeated, the daughters forget Dilaudid.  To put it succinctly, this isn't a medication which is easily forgotten.The family is all coming together during the brutally hot month of August, to Osage County, Oklahoma, for a family crisis only to undergo and offer the creation of several more. It seems one is never enough with this brood.  Becoming overly heavy, exhausting even, to watch things unfold with this family. I didn't find many characters, if any at all, to care about in this film.  Their acting is what sold me, which I found superb.  One scene I did enjoy was during a completely frustrated Barbara (Julia Roberts) firing prescription pill bottles at Violet's doctor.  As he tries to ditch and dive away from the flying bottles, I couldn't say he did not deserve this.  I also could understand Barbara's reaction to her mother's doctor over-prescribing very potent medication.  This was definitely a way for her to release some of her overall pain and due anger towards her mother.Barbara, Karen (Juliette Lewis), and Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) are the three daughters who make it a habit of understandably staying away, have now returned.  The eldest, Barbara, is painfully bitter while bringing husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) and their young teenage daughter, Jean (Abigail Breslin).  Karen shows off her shiny older boyfriend (Dermot Mulroney) announcing their upcoming nuptials with great pride.  Ivy holds much of herself inside, and for good reason.  Also arriving is Vi's overly chatty sister, Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale), along with her occasionally, although precisely timed, longwinded husband, Charlie (Chris Cooper).  Soon the bus arrives in town and brings Mattie Fae's son, 'Little Charles' (Benedict Cumberbatch), which now includes everyone.With this family all assembled, be ready to duck while this bunch comes together for a dinner of verbal warfare in between courses of white hot anger.  Dishes of family secrets are passed between everyone as we learn the deep-seated problems that have infested each and everyone present.

I already know what it's like to live in an emotionally abusive environment, and it doesn't even require anyone to be addicted to drugs or alcohol, trust me.

Meryl Streep is a master at humanizing cruel characters and she continues that tradition where we learn that her mother was abusive and her husband cheated on her with her own sister and they had a child. kinda soap opera-ish. Her daughters resemble her in various ways, with aspects of her cruelty and/or coldness. I mean who has a physical skirmish with their mother at their father's funeral dinner, no matter how poorly the mother is behaving. instead of physically tackling your mother, why not leave the house to cool down. not as dramatic, but more believable. secrets come out and the family separates post-funeral with seemingly no intention of seeing one another again. this is a family who loves to fight even though they do sort of care about one another, or perhaps it is the husband's/father's death that is the catalyst, but alot of information could've remained unspoken, as far as I was concerned. acting is top notch and I can understand why actors would be drawn to this material about the darker side of human nature/behavior, but not an engaging story for the audience and no one to root for. everybody is almost believable, but just a tiny bit over the top - not the acting, but the behavior - as if characters have kept stuff so bottled up inside that the death uncorked everyone. But that's the thing, not everyone in a family has some deep dark secret. The story is abit too concentrated, abit too play like in that every character has their shtick and all of them together is too much; about a third of the featured characters abuse drugs or alcohol and said abuse is a featured part of the story: the lead, the suicide, the seducer and his victim. I thought the actor playing Little Charles was too old for the part, not age wise, but his screen persona is too mature to play Chris Cooper's son though he's a fine actor. The film also contains a fair amount of cursing, which I didn't like. dislike when a female character calls another female character b*tch, and especially when the other character is her mother - to me, it's just unnecessary. For comparison, the dead father in this story cheats on his wife with her sister and produces a child but no character calls him so much as an a*hole. 2 and 1/2 stars.",2,kinda hard to like the story but it is well acted (spoilers)...,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,2604,"['middle', 'age', 'woman', 'unexpectedly', 'husband', 'either', 'accidently', 'commits', 'suicide', 'story', 'basically', 'how', 'family', 'death', 'spoiler', 'not', 'well', 'mother', 'behavior', 'negatively', 'impacted', 'addiction', 'pain', 'meds', 'improperly', 'prescribed', 'doctors', 'head', 'filter', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'master', 'humanizing', 'cruel', 'characters', 'tradition', 'where', 'learn', 'mother', 'was', 'abusive', 'husband', 'cheated', 'own', 'sister', 'had', 'child', 'kinda', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'daughters', 'resemble', 'various', 'ways', 'aspects', 'cruelty', 'and/or', 'coldness', 'mean', 'who', 'physical', 'skirmish', 'mother', 'father', 'funeral', 'dinner', 'matter', 'how', 'poorly', 'mother', 'behaving', 'instead', 'physically', 'tackling', 'mother', 'why', 'not', 'leave', 'house', 'cool', 'down', 'not', 'dramatic', 'more', 'believable', 'secrets', 'come', 'out', 'family', 'post-funeral', 'seemingly', 'intention', 'seeing', 'one', 'again', 'family', 'who', 'fight', 'even', 'do', 'sort', 'care', 'one', 'perhaps', ""husband's/father"", 'death', 'catalyst', 'alot', 'information', 'could', ""'ve"", 'remained', 'unspoken', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'drawn', 'material', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature/behavior', 'not', 'engaging', 'story', 'audience', 'one', 'root', 'everybody', 'almost', 'believable', 'just', 'tiny', 'bit', 'top', 'not', 'acting', 'behavior', 'characters', 'have', 'kept', 'stuff', 'so', 'bottled', 'up', 'death', 'uncorked', 'everyone', 'thing', 'not', 'everyone', 'family', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'story', 'abit', 'too', 'concentrated', 'abit', 'too', 'play', 'character', 'shtick', 'together', 'too', 'much', 'third', 'featured', 'characters', 'abuse', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'said', 'abuse', 'featured', 'part', 'story', 'lead', 'suicide', 'seducer', 'victim', 'thought', 'actor', 'playing', 'Little', 'Charles', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'not', 'age', 'wise', 'screen', 'persona', 'too', 'mature', 'play', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'son', 'fine', 'actor', 'film', 'also', 'fair', 'amount', 'cursing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'dislike', 'when', 'female', 'character', 'female', 'character', 'b*tch', 'especially', 'when', 'other', 'character', 'mother', 'just', 'unnecessary', 'comparison', 'dead', 'father', 'story', 'wife', 'sister', 'child', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'a*hole', '2', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

1684699,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00H7LINKE,Steven Aldersley,"[23, 27]","***This review contains minor spoilers***I was surprised to find my local theater almost full for today's viewing of August: Osage County. I had assumed that with the movie being in the second week of its run, and the NFL Championship games on TV, I would have the place to myself. That says a lot about the appeal of Meryl Streep, who is probably the best actor we will ever see. The first thing I noticed was that there was a lot of grey hair present in the audience, and I briefly enjoyed the fact that most audience members were older than me for once.Despite being listed as a drama, the movie produced plenty of laughs. However, most were in sympathy or shock at the darkness of the subject matter. The laughs came because the movie so keenly observes how dysfunctional families can be. The Weston family takes that theme to the extreme and cannot boast a single member that comes close to what we would consider normal.If you have seen Eraserhead and remember the scene where Henry Spencer meets his girlfriend's family, you might begin to approach how uncomfortable the atmosphere in the Weston household can be. The opening scene introduces us to Beverly Weston (Sam Shepard), who writes poetry when his alcoholism allows. We quickly realize why he feels the need to escape reality when we meet his wife, Violet (Meryl Streep). She's almost permanently high on a cocktail of pills, and has the appearance of a zombie in these opening shots. Her husband decides to leave in the first few minutes of the story, and we eventually learn that he has committed suicide. This sets off an incredible chain of events as family members start showing up to offer their condolences and attend the funeral.The movie was adapted from a play, and it feels like it throughout the two-hour running time. This is a story which only uses two or three settings, and most of the time we are in the Weston's home. The acting on display is terrific across the board. As much as I admired Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine, Streep's performance was better. I highly doubt that she'll beat Blanchett on Oscar night because of the nature of the story, but the performance is the best I have seen all year. Despite Streep's towering performance, her supporting cast had a lot to contribute. Julia Roberts deserved her Supporting Actress nod, but I would have to say that every character was portrayed well.Some of the confrontations in this movie are powerful and memorable. Streep's showdown with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Doubt came to mind a few times as some of the arguments in August: Osage County sizzled and boiled over. One of my favorite scenes involves Chris Cooper saying grace, and in a way it's a microcosm of the entire movie. There are also a couple of major surprises along the way, and I certainly won't reveal them here, but if you're a fan of dialogue and the portrayal of human interaction, you'll admire this movie. That doesn't necessarily mean you will want to see it repeatedly and add it to your home movie collection, but it's worth seeing at least once.The reason I think it will be ignored at the Oscars is Streep's previous track record and the fact that this story is so unsettling and ugly to experience. That said, the acting took my breath away at times, and I enjoyed seeing the story unfold. I loved listening to Streep, Roberts, Chris Cooper and Julianne Nicholson deliver their lines. I wouldn't consider the movie a fun watch, despite the dark humor, but it does a lot of things extremely well. Like Lincoln, this is one you'll grab from the shelf when you are starving for intelligent dialogue and masterful acting, rather than the sheer pleasure of some movie plots. You'll might well be reminded of chaotic conversations you've had with your own friends or family.I'll always be amazed at how Meryl Streep seems to become the person she is playing on the screen. It's different every time.",4,"Ugly, uncomfortable, dark, funny, tragic, and fantastic",1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,3911,"['***This', 'review', 'contains', 'minor', 'spoilers***I', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'local', 'theater', 'almost', 'full', 'today', 'viewing', 'August', 'Osage', 'County', 'had', 'assumed', 'movie', 'being', 'second', 'week', 'run', 'NFL', 'Championship', 'games', 'TV', 'would', 'have', 'place', 'myself', 'lot', 'appeal', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'actor', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'was', 'lot', 'grey', 'hair', 'present', 'audience', 'briefly', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'most', 'audience', 'members', 'were', 'older', 'once.Despite', 'being', 'listed', 'drama', 'movie', 'produced', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'However', 'most', 'were', 'sympathy', 'shock', 'darkness', 'subject', 'matter', 'laughs', 'came', 'movie', 'so', 'keenly', 'how', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'can', 'be', 'Weston', 'family', 'theme', 'extreme', 'can', 'not', 'boast', 'single', 'member', 'close', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'have', 'seen', 'Eraserhead', 'remember', 'scene', 'where', 'Henry', 'Spencer', 'girlfriend', 'family', 'might', 'begin', 'approach', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'atmosphere', 'Weston', 'household', 'can', 'be', 'opening', 'scene', 'introduces', 'Beverly', 'Weston', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'who', 'poetry', 'when', 'alcoholism', 'quickly', 'realize', 'why', 'need', 'escape', 'reality', 'when', 'meet', 'wife', 'Violet', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'almost', 'permanently', 'high', 'cocktail', 'pills', 'appearance', 'zombie', 'opening', 'shots', 'husband', 'leave', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'story', 'eventually', 'learn', 'committed', 'suicide', 'off', 'incredible', 'chain', 'events', 'family', 'members', 'start', 'showing', 'up', 'offer', 'condolences', 'attend', 'funeral.The', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'play', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'story', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'settings', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'Weston', 'home', 'acting', 'display', 'terrific', 'board', 'As', 'much', 'admired', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'Streep', 'performance', 'was', 'better', 'highly', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'beat', 'Blanchett', 'Oscar', 'night', 'nature', 'story', 'performance', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'Streep', 'towering', 'performance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'had', 'lot', 'contribute', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'deserved', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'nod', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'character', 'was', 'portrayed', 'well.Some', 'confrontations', 'movie', 'are', 'powerful', 'memorable', 'Streep', 'showdown', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Doubt', 'came', 'mind', 'few', 'times', 'arguments', 'August', 'Osage', 'County', 'sizzled', 'boiled', 'over', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'saying', 'grace', 'way', 'microcosm', 'entire', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'major', 'surprises', 'way', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'here', ""'re"", 'fan', 'dialogue', 'portrayal', 'human', 'interaction', ""'ll"", 'admire', 'movie', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'repeatedly', 'add', 'home', 'movie', 'collection', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once.The', 'reason', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'ignored', 'Oscars', 'Streep', 'previous', 'track', 'record', 'fact', 'story', 'so', 'unsettling', 'ugly', 'experience', 'said', 'acting', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'story', 'unfold', 'loved', 'listening', 'Streep', 'Roberts', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'deliver', 'lines', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'dark', 'humor', 'lot', 'things', 'extremely', 'well', 'Lincoln', 'one', ""'ll"", 'grab', 'shelf', 'when', 'are', 'starving', 'intelligent', 'dialogue', 'masterful', 'acting', 'rather', 'sheer', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'plots', ""'ll"", 'might', 'well', 'be', 'reminded', 'chaotic', 'conversations', ""'ve"", 'had', 'own', 'friends', 'family.I', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'become', 'person', 'playing', 'screen', 'different', 'time']",N/A
1684700,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00H7LINKE,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[5, 6]","Okay, first a note and suggestion:  As I post this, there are already 36 reviews posted on Amazon for ""AOC"".  The BD and DVD won't be released until April 6th (though Digital Download starts on March 28th).  I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as review of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by ""Most Recent"" first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to my review of the DVD (non-Bluray) version. As I understand it the bonus features are the same on both the DVD and BD for this release.In the last three years I've (now seen AOC) in FOUR different ""formats"" and I always find something new in it (whether is be one of playwright Tracy Letts' clever lines, or a body movement by one of the cast members). I first saw the ""touring"" stage version starring Estelle Parsons. Next was a wonderful stage production here in Philadelphia by a well-known local theater company. I saw the film version last year when it played first-run on the big screen and last week I was sent (and watched) the Bluray version of the Weinstein Company film being distributed by Anchor Bay Entertainment. This review is of the BD, including the ""special features"".I won't spend a lot of time on the script itself - since I'm sure others have commented on that already. I will say that this is a story about ""family secrets"" and therefore I highly suggest that you not read lengthy reviews first, which may include some ""spoilers"". I hate ""spoilers and you won't find any in this review. The film works better when you don't know too much - even the first 15 minutes of the script.As for the acting, what can I say? Hey this is Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts and Margo Martindale (all Oscar noms!). And the guys in the film are great too. What a surprise for ""Sherlock"" fans to see Benedict Cumberbatch playing a Midwesterner!  I have to admit though that I think the play works better on a stage. The original was (and I guess still is) a three-act, three-hour evening (including intermission). The film runs one minute over two hours. So there is a lot of the script that was cut. And, because director John Wells took the film OUTDOORS (we see lots of wheat fields and country roads)  that take our eyes off the real story by looking at the gorgeous scenery. On stage, there was a three story house and front yard. All the action took place there and your eyes were concentrating on the actors.So, yes, I liked the film - and more folks will get to see it via the film and DVD version - but, I encourage you to see a stage version should the opportunity arise.The special features include a feature length commentary with director Wells and the Cinematographer (which I have not yet listened to), About 20 minutes of deleted scenes (which can be replayed with Director and Cinematographer' commentary) and a  ""Making of"" featurette - maybe 16 minutes - which include cast interviews and portions of a Q&A; at an identified screening (where much of the talk is how great it is to work with Meryl Streep).  Finally there is a seven minute featurette where playwight Letts comments on his own writing style and why he wrote AOC.I hope this review was both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Review of the Bluray version - with concentration on the ""Special Features""",1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,3504,"['Okay', 'first', 'note', 'suggestion', 'post', 'are', 'already', '36', 'reviews', 'posted', 'Amazon', 'AOC', 'BD', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'released', 'April', '6th', 'Digital', 'Download', 'March', '28th', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'film', 'together', 'version', 'will', 'find', 'lots', 'reviews', 'theatrical', 'version', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'review', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'version', 'covers', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'So', 'always', 'recommend', 'buyers', 'sort', 'reviews', 'Most', 'Recent', 'first', 'then', 'look', 'see', 'format', 'reviewer', 'discussing', 'said', 'review', 'DVD', 'non-Bluray', 'version', 'understand', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'same', 'DVD', 'BD', 'last', 'three', 'years', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'AOC', 'FOUR', 'different', 'formats', 'always', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'be', 'one', 'playwright', 'Tracy', 'Letts', 'clever', 'lines', 'body', 'movement', 'one', 'cast', 'members', 'first', 'saw', 'touring', 'stage', 'version', 'starring', 'Estelle', 'Parsons', 'Next', 'was', 'wonderful', 'stage', 'production', 'here', 'Philadelphia', 'well-known', 'local', 'theater', 'company', 'saw', 'film', 'version', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'played', 'first-run', 'big', 'screen', 'last', 'week', 'was', 'sent', 'watched', 'Bluray', 'version', 'Weinstein', 'Company', 'film', 'being', 'distributed', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'review', 'BD', 'including', 'special', 'features', '.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'script', ""'m"", 'sure', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'already', 'will', 'say', 'story', 'family', 'secrets', 'therefore', 'highly', 'suggest', 'not', 'read', 'lengthy', 'reviews', 'first', 'may', 'include', 'spoilers', 'hate', 'spoilers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'review', 'film', 'better', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'even', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'script.As', 'acting', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Hey', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'Oscar', 'noms', 'guys', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'What', 'surprise', 'Sherlock', 'fans', 'see', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'playing', 'Midwesterner', 'have', 'admit', 'think', 'play', 'better', 'stage', 'original', 'was', 'guess', 'still', 'three-act', 'three-hour', 'evening', 'including', 'intermission', 'film', 'one', 'minute', 'two', 'hours', 'So', 'lot', 'script', 'was', 'cut', 'director', 'John', 'Wells', 'took', 'film', 'OUTDOORS', 'see', 'lots', 'wheat', 'fields', 'country', 'roads', 'take', 'eyes', 'real', 'story', 'looking', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'stage', 'was', 'three', 'story', 'house', 'front', 'yard', 'action', 'took', 'place', 'there', 'eyes', 'were', 'concentrating', 'actors.So', 'yes', 'liked', 'film', 'more', 'folks', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'film', 'DVD', 'version', 'encourage', 'see', 'stage', 'version', 'should', 'opportunity', 'arise.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'feature', 'length', 'commentary', 'director', 'Wells', 'Cinematographer', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'listened', 'About', '20', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'replayed', 'Director', 'Cinematographer', 'commentary', 'Making', 'featurette', 'maybe', '16', 'minutes', 'include', 'cast', 'interviews', 'portions', 'Q', 'A', 'identified', 'screening', 'where', 'much', 'talk', 'how', 'great', 'work', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Finally', 'seven', 'minute', 'featurette', 'where', 'playwight', 'Letts', 'comments', 'own', 'writing', 'style', 'why', 'wrote', 'AOC.I', 'hope', 'review', 'was', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

1684722,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00H7LINKE,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","In a nutshell, &#8220;August: Osage County&#8221; is about a dysfunctional family reunion in their remote Oklahoma home. The family members (and their spouses, child and lover) reluctantly show up, all knowing that this is going to be a very uncomfortable stay, especially when their whimsical Violet (Meryl Streep), suffering from cancer, is addicted to narcotics.As it turns out, it is a very uncomfortable stay for everyone in the film, and audiences, too. And the real problem is, the conventional story &#8211; based on a Tracy Letts play, adapted by the playwright himself &#8211; is supposed to be darkly comedic, while the film itself is dark but not very funny. There are also dark secrets to be exposed, but the revelations are not very shocking.&#8220;August: Osage County&#8221; is a very good example of too much acting and too little direction. It seems director John Wells strives to be respectful of source material and those great players &#8211; including unstoppable Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts &#8211; when he should step in and show his vision. In fact, he does, when the family&#8217;s patriarch (Sam Shepard) appears in the earlier part, but not enough.Characters don&#8217;t have to be likable (and here they are not), but at least should provide some reason for us to care, which the director fails to do.

My cousin was bellyaching at our aunt's awful jello salad.  An uncle was half in the tank before dinner started and put his hands in the mashed potatoes while trying to reach for his bottle to top off his intoxicated state of mind.  Our collective fiendish children were ransacking the house looking for more eggs and candy and any loose change between the couch cushions.  And any assortment of great aunts, grandmas and old clucking hens from the neighborhood that show up cause their own families are long moved away and some idiot kid leaves the door open all get together in the kitchen and start yelling and haggling at each other over how to over cook the ham&#8230;.  Anyways, the scene is chaos without purpose.  So my sister-in-law popped this in before I could pull up any sort of resistance-cause the NFL & NCAA saw fit to not have any games on and on a way off side note why can't they do something for us men on this worst day of any holiday-we pay them billions yearly.  They gotta think of something.  Ain't like Memorial Day or 4th of July where it's nice enough to go outside and drink beer and ignore one another.  Nope, all we got on Easter is family and over sugared children.So she put in this movie and for once we all sat in silence and saw a family almost as every bit as dysfunctional as ours but with far better acting from Ms. Streep and Ms. Roberts.  C'mon, every time Aunt Joy screams, cries and goes running from the room cause we chuck her jello salad in the trash she doing it more for effect and attention as anything else if you happen to believe her therapist.  So I'd recommend this film very highly in the sense that carpenters enjoy watching Noah (for the ark building you twits), police officers love Serpico, soap makers love Fight Club and maids love The Help.  It's like almost seeing yourself up on the big screen and it sure didn't pander like that Parenthood movie.

I think that anyone who has tried to escape the grips of growing up in a highly disfunctional family might appreciate the message behind this film.  Most of these characters are just trying desperately to escape their background and childhood past, but their attempts usually fail.  One tries to escape with pills, others with unsuitable partners or self-rightousness.  But just when they think they've made it out and are ready to leave the misery behind something happens or they receive some news that makes them realize they never actually escaped.  In the end however one of them actually does manage to turn their back completely on the misery of their past and move solely forward.  A movie that makes you think about one's responsibility to one's family vs one's responsibility to their own soul and what happens when those two things cannot co-exist.  This is not a happy go-lucky film, but it's unpredictable and there is a light at the end of the tunnel as we see one of them finally look across the field of their dysfunctional past and say goodbye for the last time.  Meryll Streep plays a hard-hearted woman who's endured a great deal of pain in her life and has no idea how to handle it.  Her performance is excellent and she manages to both make you dislike her as well as feel sorry for her.  Though many reviewers are calling this film depressing I actually found it only partly so.  It also has a dark comedic aspect to it and I found the ending to be upbeat and hopeful as we watch the person who had turned most like her mother finally turn her back on that and move forward with a smile.
