I miss the extra's and perfect playing of the previous sets.  Two stories froze near the beginning and skipped to the near end.  What I did was slowly backtrack to just after the scene froze  (this took many tries to get to the perfect place) and then was able to play to the end from that point so nothing in the story was missed.  It first happened in a story about an artistic boy at camp who prefers modeling clay to outdoor sports; it froze at an indoor cabin scene.  The second time it froze in a Peter Falk bar scene only a few minutes into the story.

1671328,A32EWKDFSW93LE,B00FEOYY8G,Buck Naked,"[41, 46]","Like others, I had bad disc #4. The replacement set worked fine, possibly because the dvds were re-authored without the complicated menu structure (99 titles) used for copy protection. Even if your disc #4 plays fine, I would hit the dvd player info button and see how many titles are on a typical disc. If it indicates 99 titles on the dvd (instead of 9 or 10 titles), you might consider requesting a replacement set to be on the safe side.Aside from the now-corrected playability problem, I have a couple gripes. Already noted by reviews, unlike the minted dvd sets, this one lacks subtitles and an episode list with short synopsis.A few episodes have a kind of snowy overlay (ie, D5 Secret Life), more noticeable in dark scenes. Perhaps it's made worse by the nicely sharp transfers, or upconversion thru home HDMI connections. Lowering your dvd player/TV setting to ""Movie/Cinema"" (instead of ""Standard"" or ""Vivid"") will darken the picture slightly and reduce the snowy appearance in those episodes.8 episodes have a greenish hue instead of being b&w.; It's not always noticeable, and you can always turn off your TV's color, but they should have corrected it:D1: Very moral theft; Contest for Aaron Gold; Outlaw in Town.D2: Man who found the moneyD3: LandladyD4: GratitudeD5: Coming Home; Make my death bed.",4,"Problem corrected, new sets work fine",1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,1312,"['others', 'had', 'bad', 'disc', '4', 'replacement', 'set', 'worked', 'fine', 'possibly', 'dvds', 'were', 're-authored', 'complicated', 'menu', 'structure', '99', 'titles', 'used', 'copy', 'protection', 'Even', 'disc', '4', 'plays', 'fine', 'would', 'hit', 'dvd', 'player', 'info', 'button', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'titles', 'are', 'typical', 'disc', '99', 'titles', 'dvd', 'instead', '9', '10', 'titles', 'might', 'consider', 'requesting', 'replacement', 'set', 'be', 'safe', 'side.Aside', 'now-corrected', 'playability', 'problem', 'have', 'couple', 'gripes', 'Already', 'noted', 'reviews', 'minted', 'dvd', 'sets', 'one', 'subtitles', 'episode', 'list', 'short', 'synopsis.A', 'few', 'episodes', 'have', 'kind', 'snowy', 'overlay', 'ie', 'D5', 'Secret', 'Life', 'more', 'noticeable', 'dark', 'scenes', 'Perhaps', 'made', 'worse', 'nicely', 'sharp', 'transfers', 'upconversion', 'thru', 'home', 'HDMI', 'connections', 'Lowering', 'dvd', 'player/TV', 'setting', 'Movie/Cinema', 'instead', 'Standard', 'Vivid', 'will', 'darken', 'picture', 'slightly', 'reduce', 'snowy', 'appearance', 'episodes.8', 'episodes', 'have', 'greenish', 'hue', 'instead', 'being', 'b', 'w', 'not', 'always', 'noticeable', 'can', 'always', 'turn', 'off', 'TV', 'color', 'should', 'have', 'corrected', 'D1', 'Very', 'moral', 'theft', 'Contest', 'Aaron', 'Gold', 'Outlaw', 'Town.D2', 'Man', 'who', 'found', 'moneyD3', 'LandladyD4', 'GratitudeD5', 'Coming', 'Home', 'Make', 'death', 'bed']",Alfred Hitchcock Presents Season 6

1671332,A12I6Q6EAPFMNC,B00FEOYY8G,"dustman ""Dustin Turnmyre""","[5, 6]","Many (justified) disparaging words have been posted about this release.  I relunctanly purchased it as it became evident that Universal would not release Season 6 as in the previous five seasons.  I suppose it's better than nothing. There are absolutely no supplemental materials in this edition.  The disc allows you to play the episodes but there is no descriptive information included to guide you to a particular episode.  I guess if there's such a thing as a ""Hitchcock Presents"" episode guide you could refer to that.  Otherwise you're reduced to a ""hunt and peck"" system in order to sort through this mess.  The good news is that the video quality of these episodes are not appreciably different from previous releases.  Somebody has really punched us in the gut with this one.  Whoever is responsible should be ashamed.  I don't guess there's any hope for a future release rectifying this so we can look forward to the rest of the seasons being released in like manner, and that's not a sure thing.  Oh well...Since orignally reviewing this product, it occurred to me that giving it a single star is a bit unfair.  ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" happened to be one of my favorite TV series ever.  If merely reviewing the content of Season 6, I would easily have given it 4 stars.  There are some great episodes included in that season.  For that reason I'm bumping up my original rating to 3 stars.  I can't overlook the bare bones treatment given but on the other hand some consideration must be given to the quality of the shows.  It amazes me that a company like Universal couldn't follow through and be consistent/faithful to the format created in the first five seasons.I suppose for the sake of completion this release will have to do.

1671334,A2G85SHONFVPKN,B00FEOYY8G,"Eric Hofmann ""Sonthert""","[25, 32]","Here's Season Six of Alfred Hitchcock Presents arrived today.Season Six contains thirty-eight episodes on five discs:Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's CoatThe Doubtful DoctorA Very Moral TheftThe Contest for Aaron GoldThe Five-Forty-EightPen PalOutlaw in TownO Youth and Beauty!The MoneySybillaThe Man with Two FacesThe Baby-Blue ExpressionThe Man Who Found the MoneyThe Changing HeartSummer ShadeA Crime for MothersThe Last EscapeThe Greatest Monster of Them AllThe LandladyThe ThrowbackThe Kiss-OffThe Horse PlayerIncident in a Small JailA Woman's HelpMuseum PieceComing, MamaDeathmateGratitudeThe Pearl NecklaceYou Can't Trust a ManThe Gloating PlaceSelf DefenseA Secret LifeServant ProblemComing HomeFinal ArrangementsMake My Death BedAmbitionIf online ratings are any reflection, Season Six is probably the second most loved season of Alfred Hitchcock's half-hour long format television show after Season Five. His stories certainly picked up speed and the style of them in Season Six have gotten grittier, more ""American"" and less ""British"".The discs are exactly what you expect out of a DVD-R, which is a custom-manufactured DVD that lacks anything other than the material. They are made to keep costs down for titles that are expected to be slow sellers; they are the hallmark of the decline of the DVD and recorded media in general.I understand everyone's complaints about the DVD-R format. I hate it too. Reality has to set in though. If Season Six doesn't sell well there may not be a Season seven or Universal Editions of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour either. These discs don't have anything except a ""Play All"" or play a specific scene selections. DVDs are in decline, sales are down, and if all trends continue, they will continue to decline. Studios can't afford to spend all the setup costs to make DVD sets for TV shows (or movies) that aren't going to sell enough units to recoup costs. So, short of everybody wanting a copy buying three or four sets, DVD-R is the least risky move the studios can make. I'll keep buying them, if they come out, in summary. I'd rather have a s***ty DVD-R set than nothing. Really, at the end of the day, the reason I think people are upset by the DVD-Rs is that its insulting. Universal almost wants to be saying ""You're love of our shows isn't enough. There aren't enough of you and there isn't enough demand for the show(s) you love."" I get how the critical reviewers feel, I feel the same way.I have another complaint, one that is special to me. I like subtitles (English SDH) on DVDs. These (or no other DVD-Rs that I've seen) contain the formatting necessary to have subtitles. If Universal reads this, English SDH subtitles are a must have! Yeah, I don't think Universal cares about the reviews either. If they did, they would release full sets. I should add that the case, which is consistent with DVD-Rs...crappy. The back of the case claims that the DVD has subtitles. Even a bigger disappointment from the transient flash of hope that they had put them on even though the product description didn't mention or list them. Even worse, the back cover of the case looks like they just ""copied"" the back of the case from an earlier season without really checking what information was correct and what wasn't, hence the mistake regarding having subtitles. The case is a standard type set plastic case with clear outer cover, a paper insert outside with graphics consistent with the other seasons of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Inside the case are flip leaves holding the discs. Not impressive, to say the least. Functional, however.I also get the complaints about the quality of the DVD-Rs ""lasting"" and dying. I'm seeing that with new DVDs as well. The problem isn't the DVD-Rs, in my opinion, its quality of the pressings. I've gone through four copies of ""The Wedding Singer"" and they keep going bad. DVDs, R or Not are not as good as they were. Some studios like Warner and 20th Century Fox are turning out inexcusably bad quality DVDs. Universal a little bit. I'm sure somebody more informed than myself could explain why thats the case, but it seems to coincide with pressings in Mexico. Perhaps they're using poorer quality plastic to save money? Its a side point, I think.Other details regarding the release:The video quality: Varies, obviously. Some of the film stock is a little damaged, but the remastering job is decent. I'd say the video quality on my clanky old DVD players, not enhanced Blu-Ray, is about B to B+. Its not sweet, sweet remastering, but its not a half-burned film dropped in a vat of vinegar either. Universal didn't churn and burn this one. The video quality actually seems better than on some of the earlier seasons. I don't want to praise the purveyors of DVD-Rs, so I'll just say its not a disappointment.Sound Quality: Its not bad. Its clear, doesn't distort too badly or have excessive static. There is a little static here and there and the normal ""hiss"" for the period. I will make a complaint the levels vary somewhat. The levels on the first disk, for instance, got progressively louder for the first five or six episodes and then tapered back off a little. I'd give the sound about a B+ as well. I can't help but remembering that the television show is from more than fifty years ago.The season contains ""The Pearl Necklace"" which is easily one of the best of all the Alfred Hitchcock Presents Episodes of all time. ""Sybilla"", ""The Horse Player"", ""The Landlady"" and ""Incident at a Small Jail"" are all top flight episodes in this season. Other notable episodes are ""A Crime for Mothers"", ""Self-Defense"", ""The Gloating Place"" and ""Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat"". The quality of the material alone is worth buying the set, damned be the the DVD-Rs. If they had switched to DVD-Rs around Season Two, there wouldn't be a Season Six to review I would wager.Update: Like so many people, my first set came with a defective disc 4. I returned it to Amazon, got a new set and now disc 5 is defective, but only because of my Sony DVD carousels on random. The disc selected on random doesn't produce sound. The original discs from the first set with the defective disc 4 didn't play at all on random. So, this is a vast improvement. Will attempt to actuate the return/exchange function on Amazon again and see if disc 5s are all defective.For the record, I think I had to go through three sets of Season 1 (with their crummy double-sided discs) to get a full working copy.",5,"It may be DVD-R, but its Alfred Hitchcock Presents Season 6",1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,6450,"['Here', 'Season', 'Six', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock',

I finally took the plunge a week ago, and was pleasantly surprised that the discs performed very well with one exception:  Disc 1 - THE CONTEST FOR AARON GOLD episode skips and sticks; otherwise the rest are working great.  That said, I have to agree with the majority of other reviewers here....Universal should have put more effort into manufacturing a better product, particularly in the Alfred Hitchcock genre.  I would like to see the same quality that went into producing the first five seasons, which are excellent.  As for the lack of episode guide with this season, here's one suggestion:  beg, borrow or steal a copy of the ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS COMPANION (I bought mine here on Amazon), and you're good to go.  I typed up my own condensed listing of the episodes on the five discs, printed it, and attached it to the fly leaf on the DVD case.  Voila!  Problem solved.  All things considered, I am absolutely delighted to be able to add Season 6 to my collection.

Despite the fact that it is now being produced on DVD-R (at a higher asking retail price and exclusive to the U.S. only distribution) there are those who are stubbornly still going with it.  Although I respect their regard for the show I have no sympathy or appreciation for the very poor judgement on this.I'm sure that the series previously did well enough as a general ""standard"" DVD release but some supporter's logic (or lack-of-it) in the ready acceptance of MOD really escapes me on this.  Outside of the quality of the subject matter itself to recommend it the video source elements are not even digitally remastered and fully restored.  Why make things even worse by going to the inferior MOD?!In this format even if it went on sale I still wouldn't buy it.If anyone is seriously interested in constructively voicing their dissent in this abhorrent move to DVD-R provided is a weblink to the Universal Studios Home Entertainment online customer contact webpage:[...]If Universal either won't or can't successfully handle this tv property on ""standard"" DVD then sensibly turn it over to an outfit like Shout!

This was when I opened it on Christmas Day (thanks to my wife who purchased it for me!!).I'd like to discuss my particular set. I see many people on here are complaining that their DVDs don't play properly. I already watched 4/5 discs and they all played fine. Let's hope disc 5 works just as well. The only season that gave me trouble was season 1. However I FINALLY came across a good copy so I now have good copies of seasons 1-6. All we need now is season 7 and all of Alfred Hitchcock Presents will be available on DVD. I'd also like to note that the packaging of season 6 is different than other seasons. This one is in a simple snap case while seasons 1-5 were released in fold-over cases that gave episode descriptions. Universal is getting lazy I presume.Next, I'll discuss the episodes themselves. So far, season 6 has some of the show's best episodes. A favorite of mine is ""Contest For Aaron Gold"", a great tale of a boy at a children's camp who is eager for an upcoming ceramics display. Aaron Gold would rather work on his clay knight than swim and play ball which gets the camp's main instructor mad. Curiosity comes about when Aaron refuses to put a second arm on his knight. Other interesting episode I came across are ""A Very Moral Theft"", ""O Youth And Beauty"", ""Sybilla"" among others. Season 6 is great for moral stories mixed with suspense.In conclusion, season six is a great season of AHP. Now I'm not sure if I was lucky on this or maybe Universal fixed this set, but mine was fine. The quality was possibly better than any other season because I didn't see much film grain or black lines running through the episodes here. Universal really cleaned up the quality a bit here. I'd buy this set, and simply return if defective and get a replacement.",4,"6 down, 1 to go!",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,1851,"['only', 'recently', 'found', 'out', 'Season', '6', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Presents', 'was', 'DVD', 'was', 'when', 'opened', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'thanks', 'wife', 'who', 'purchased', '.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'discuss', 'particular', 'set', 'see', 'many', 'people', 'here', 'are', 'complaining', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'properly', 'already', 'watched', '4/5', 'discs', 'played', 'fine', 'Let', 'hope', 'disc', '5', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'season', 'gave', 'trouble', 'was', 'season', '1', 'However', 'FINALLY', 'came', 'good', 'copy', 'now', 'have', 'good', 'copies', 'seasons', '1-6', 'need', 'now', 'season', '7', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Presents', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'note', 'packaging', 'season', '6', 'different', 'other', 'seasons', 'one', 'simple', 'snap', 'case', 'seasons', '1-5', 'were', 'released', 'fold-over', 'cases', 'gave', 'descriptions', 'Universal', 'getting', 'lazy', 'presume.Next', ""'ll"", 'discuss', 'episodes', 'So', 'far', 'season', '6', 'show', 'best', 'episodes', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Contest', 'Aaron', 'Gold', 'great', 'tale', 'boy', 'children', 'camp', 'who', 'eager', 'upcoming', 'ceramics', 'display', 'Aaron', 'Gold', 'would', 'rather', 'work', 'clay', 'knight', 'swim', 'play', 'ball', 'camp', 'main', 'instructor', 'mad', 'Curiosity', 'when', 'Aaron', 'put', 'second', 'arm', 'knight', 'Other', 'interesting', 'episode', 'came', 'are', 'Very', 'Moral', 'Theft', 'O', 'Youth', 'Beauty', 'Sybilla', 'others', 'Season', '6', 'great', 'moral', 'stories', 'mixed', 'suspense.In', 'conclusion', 'season', 'six', 'great', 'season', 'AHP', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'lucky', 'maybe', 'Universal', 'fixed', 'set', 'mine', 'was', 'fine', 'quality', 'was', 'possibly', 'better', 'other', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'film', 'grain', 'black', 'lines', 'running', 'episodes', 'here', 'Universal', 'really', 'cleaned', 'up', 'quality', 'bit', 'here', ""'d"", 'buy', 'set', 'simply', 'return', 'defective', 'get', 'replacement']",Alfred Hitchcock Presents Season 6

Well I bought this new and it was so bad, I had to fight with the dvd player every time I wanted to watch the dvd.  I thought it was going to ruin my dvd player.  It made horrible sounds, wouldn't &#34;catch&#34; so it could play, skipped, stopped/froze for no reason, and parts would not play.  On the other hand, this is how much I love the Hitchcock stories, that I put up with all this trauma just to see the stories in Season 6.  However, I would never return this and risk someone else buying this in a used condition, and having to put up with the same bull I did.  And, if Season 6 it ever released on proper dvds, like Season 1 through Season 5 have been, then I will repurchase it.  Maybe cheap old universal had to have a dry run and see who would buy crappy dvds before they shelled out the money for the nicely packaged, actual working proper, dvds.
