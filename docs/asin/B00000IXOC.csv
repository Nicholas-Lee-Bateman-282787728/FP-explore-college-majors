505137,A2OP21WUY8L3WL,B00000IXOC,Robert Meeks,"[5, 6]","CAPTURED is a thriller which pits a development tycoon against a car thief.Holden Downs (Nick Mancuso) is a developer who has his dream of building Millenium City halted due to a lawsuit by a conservation group. Two car thieves choose the wrong time to attempt a theft of Holden's car and he takes it out on one of them by breaking his arm. This act leaves a bad taste is the mouth of the older brother, Robert Breed (Andrew Divoff), who plans to steal the car for good. Meanwhile, Holden, who has not taken kindly to the threat, has the security system on the car updated to set a trap for the would be car thief. Robert acts on his plan to steal the car and end up as Holden's captive; pitting two captor and captive against each other with a downward spiral which presents a moral dilemma of going too far and at what point one went too far.CAPTURED does a good job of maintaining its pace and giving Mancuso quite a bit of dialogue to deliver overzealously. As Divoff presents a balancing character, it is ashame that they did not give him as much with which he could work, leaving his character underdeveloped. Despite this, Divoff does give a good performance with what he has. The imbalance in the characters, even though Mancuso's character is the primary, takes away from the potential to sypathize with other than Mancuso's character, and that will disappear in short order.What CAPTURED ends up presenting is a story about one man, who nobody cares about, and a thief, who nobody cares about, winding its way through a predictable series of events and an overdrawn ending which was obvious well before the movie got there.Despite this, CAPTURED does maintain a good pace with Mancuso and Divoff working well off of each other. There are moments of tension which raise the film above its own predictability. CAPTURED is not a movie I would highly recommend, but, if you have nothing better to do, it will not bore. It frankly strikes me as a 95 minute episode of The Outer Limits with its moral dilemma and its twist ending.--Bob",2,Roadsign ahead reads 'You'll see it coming',1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,2039,"['CAPTURED', 'thriller', 'development', 'tycoon', 'car', 'thief.Holden', 'Downs', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'developer', 'who', 'dream', 'building', 'Millenium', 'City', 'halted', 'due', 'lawsuit', 'conservation', 'group', 'Two', 'car', 'thieves', 'choose', 'wrong', 'time', 'attempt', 'theft', 'Holden', 'car', 'out', 'one', 'breaking', 'arm', 'act', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'older', 'brother', 'Robert', 'Breed', 'Andrew', 'Divoff', 'who', 'steal', 'car', 'good', 'Meanwhile', 'Holden', 'who', 'not', 'taken', 'kindly', 'threat', 'security', 'system', 'car', 'updated', 'set', 'trap', 'would', 'be', 'car', 'thief', 'Robert', 'plan', 'steal', 'car', 'end', 'up', 'Holden', 'captive', 'pitting', 'two', 'captor', 'captive', 'other', 'downward', 'spiral', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'what', 'point', 'one', 'went', 'too', 'far.CAPTURED', 'good', 'job', 'maintaining', 'pace', 'giving', 'Mancuso', 'quite', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'deliver', 'overzealously', 'Divoff', 'balancing', 'character', 'ashame', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'work', 'leaving', 'character', 'underdeveloped', 'Divoff', 'give', 'good', 'performance', 'what', 'imbalance', 'characters', 'even', 'Mancuso', 'character', 'primary', 'away', 'potential', 'sypathize', 'other', 'Mancuso', 'character', 'will', 'disappear', 'short', 'order.What', 'CAPTURED', 'up', 'presenting', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'nobody', 'thief', 'who', 'nobody', 'winding', 'way', 'predictable', 'series', 'events', 'overdrawn', 'ending', 'was', 'obvious', 'well', 'movie', 'got', 'there.Despite', 'CAPTURED', 'maintain', 'good', 'pace', 'Mancuso', 'Divoff', 'working', 'well', 'other', 'are', 'moments', 'tension', 'raise', 'film', 'own', 'predictability', 'CAPTURED', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'will', 'not', 'bore', 'frankly', '95', 'minute', 'episode', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'twist', 'ending.', 'Bob']",Captured
505138,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B00000IXOC,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","Throughout life, when you're a couple of avid B lovers, you will come across some really horrible movies and some really great unintentional comedies. Typically you will discover these movies between midnight and 4 pm. For some reason we have found these four hours to be crucial in stumbling upon B gold, which was the case 11 years ago. The brothers Sid were having a typical good old time on Saturday night when a great 90's B movie came on. The film was captivating in the most B way possible. The part when the car owners pegs the thief in the head with a wrench really won us over. However the next day we had no clue what the movie title was, and never found out until a luckily coincidence last night. While updating the movie query a suggestion was made that we may also enjoy ""Captured"". Immediately a light bulb went off saying this may be that hilarious movie watched so many years ago. And thankfully....she was.Captured is centered around a real estate developer Holden Downs, and total nut case, who is on the brink of a nervous breakdown. He is attempting to develop his dream property but getting sued by a bunch of tree huggers while doing so. One evening while going to his car he discovers a couple thieves , on being the guy who played Wishmaster...awesome!, attempting to snatch his porsche. He winds up scaring them off then hires his young guido nephew to build a car that will trap any thief inside. You can see where this is going. Obviously Wishmaster breaks into Holden's car and becomes trapped inside for lots of mental torture. It's really quite awesome and hilarious. There are a lot of twists and turns with an actual well written plot for a 90's B. We were having trouble like it on a B or legitimate level....but naturally B level was decided as the clear winner.Being a movie from our past, Captured had a lot to live up too based off the memory of it. It didn't disappoint, much like a chicken marsala slice from Pudgy's. Wow that sounds great right now. Captured fit into every possible required category for a B proving yet again why the 90's really had it going on. It's really incredible the amount of hilarious B one decade could produce, and they're all shown after midnight on any given night. Because of this you should always B ready because you never know when some fine B will come your way. Sometimes it's even by dumb luck like us with Death Ring. And just think if we never got to see the immortal Death Ring...things just wouldn't be the same.",5,Winging a wrench in someones face makes Captured well worth the watch,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,2495,"['life', 'when', ""'re"", 'couple', 'avid', 'B', 'lovers', 'will', 'come', 'really', 'horrible', 'movies', 'really', 'great', 'unintentional', 'comedies', 'Typically', 'will', 'discover', 'movies', 'midnight', '4', 'pm', 'reason', 'have', 'found', 'four', 'hours', 'be', 'crucial', 'stumbling', 'B', 'gold', 'was', 'case', '11', 'years', 'ago', 'brothers', 'Sid', 'were', 'having', 'typical', 'good', 'old', 'time', 'Saturday', 'night', 'when', 'great', '90', 'B', 'movie', 'came', 'film', 'was', 'captivating', 'most', 'B', 'way', 'possible', 'part', 'when', 'car', 'owners', 'pegs', 'thief', 'head', 'wrench', 'really', 'won', 'over', 'However', 'next', 'day', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'movie', 'title', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'out', 'luckily', 'coincidence', 'last', 'night', 'updating', 'movie', 'query', 'suggestion', 'was', 'made', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Captured', 'Immediately', 'light', 'bulb', 'went', 'saying', 'may', 'be', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'watched', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'thankfully', '.she', 'was.Captured', 'centered', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'Holden', 'Downs', 'total', 'nut', 'case', 'who', 'brink', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'attempting', 'develop', 'dream', 'property', 'getting', 'sued', 'bunch', 'tree', 'huggers', 'doing', 'so', 'One', 'evening', 'going', 'car', 'couple', 'thieves', 'being', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Wishmaster', 'awesome', 'attempting', 'snatch', 'porsche', 'up', 'scaring', 'off', 'then', 'young', 'guido', 'nephew', 'build', 'car', 'will', 'trap', 'thief', 'inside', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'Obviously', 'Wishmaster', 'breaks', 'Holden', 'car', 'trapped', 'lots', 'mental', 'torture', 'really', 'quite', 'awesome', 'hilarious', 'are', 'lot', 'twists', 'actual', 'well', 'written', 'plot', '90', 'B', 'were', 'having', 'trouble', 'B', 'legitimate', 'level', '.but', 'naturally', 'B', 'level', 'was', 'decided', 'clear', 'winner.Being', 'movie', 'past', 'Captured', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'too', 'based', 'off', 'memory', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'much', 'chicken', 'marsala', 'slice', 'Pudgy', 'great', 'right', 'now', 'Captured', 'fit', 'possible', 'required', 'category', 'B', 'proving', 'yet', 'again', 'why', '90', 'really', 'had', 'going', 'really', 'incredible', 'amount', 'hilarious', 'B', 'one', 'decade', 'could', 'produce', ""'re"", 'shown', 'midnight', 'given', 'night', 'should', 'always', 'B', 'ready', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'fine', 'B', 'will', 'come', 'way', 'even', 'dumb', 'luck', 'Death', 'Ring', 'just', 'think', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'immortal', 'Death', 'Ring', 'things', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'same']",Captured

The thief also has a brother (Michael Mahonen) who enters the picture.There really wasn't much torture except for one brief scene...unless you consider getting your arm caught in an electric window torture. There are far better abduction and capture films out there. Too much of the film takes place in a garage. And a twist? In an abduction film?
