Van Damme has aged incredibly well for a man with a known history of self abusive tendencies...it appears as if Jean Claude might remember filming this little gem of a movie.The co-star, whose name I immediately forgot, tried desperately to steal this movie..it almost seemed like JCVD was used as a launch device for whatisnames career..didn't work.

Ever since I saw him in JCVD, and realized he could actually act, I was hoping he would be in better projects. Lo and behold, here it is.Here's the scoop. Van Damme is a hit man for hire. Scott Adkins is a hit man retired to take care of his comatose wife, who was put into the coma by a really bad guy. Van Damme takes a contract on said bad guy for big bucks. Adkins wants in on the hit for revenge. The two form an uncomfortable alliance to do the job. There's a bit more but why spoil.This is a cool, if derivative story. Some of the plot points you've seen before. What's happening here is the fact that it's all rather un-sensational. The fights are neat and tough. No jumping around with impossible kicks and such. The Van Damme character is quiet and reserved. He handles his hits like a professional (with one grave exception), gets paid and pursues the things he likes. He's a bit anal retentive but it doesn't get in the way of things. The Adkins character is also quiet. He lives off in the country and spends much of his time taking care of his wife. Both men are assured in their abilities to perform. No strutting or posturing. Just get the job done and get out.This is shot and cut well. The performances are decent and it's directed well. It's not great art but it is good craft.

Second, Adkins also subtle quiet assassin performance seemed to fit well with Jean-Claude. Third, the script had a nice flow with a few creative twists and, of course, the usual mayhem. Fourth, the directing was quite good in that it allowed the story to quietly unfold without a lot of visual or auditory noise to mask any inadequacies in the acting, story or setting.The only real negative is that too many of the elements or sub-plots were borrowed from the truckloads of other similar movies of the past.

I'm there!  Hell, I was there yesterday.The opener is Van Damme disguised in some hideous sideburns performing a clever assassination of some Euro-mob father-of-the-bride.  Well done, and already more promising than most of Van Damme's work in the past decade.  Thankfully, the sideburns do not endure throughout the movie.  What does is some surprisingly decent camera work, abrupt but good combat work, and not so surprisingly mediocre acting.  Van Damme has a hitman-chic, secret bachelor pad, a cute turtle, and a violin collection.Then we cut to Scott Adkins, who is sponge-bathing the catatonic wife in a bedroom the size of a quadriplex.  Oh, yeah, he's also a hitman.  These guys both agree to do the same job, end up planning on doing it at the same time, and it gets botched.  They fight.  They make up.  They work together.  To give the stars some flavor, some concepts were clearly borrowed from other movies.  Adkins pulls some a la-The Professional vanishing acts while Van Damme has a rather Transporter-ish unwelcomed female guest (who also smacks of an older, emotion-evoking Natalia Portman from The Professional).  These are over embellishments, of course.Some interesting things stuck out in this movie.  1  The filmmakers really tried to make this good--for a straight-to-DVD action flick they did, but I won't dare suggest it should've been in theaters.  2  Time is a strong element.  I think they were going for a subtle motif, but it is way in your face.  3  Neither hitman needs the money.  They kill to fill some other void.  4) Van Damme hasn't been working out nearly as much as Adkins.In the end, this was a solid straight-to-DVD action flick that made me want to re-watch Double Impact and Undisputed II where they each shined brightest.",4,Solid straight-to-DVD action flick for Adkins and Van Damme fans,1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,1893,"['was', 'way-stoked', 'one', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'Scott', 'Adkins', 'Ninja', 'Undisputed', 'II', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Quest', 'Bloodsport', ""'m"", 'there', 'Hell', 'was', 'yesterday.The', 'opener', 'Van', 'Damme', 'disguised', 'hideous', 'sideburns', 'performing', 'clever', 'assassination', 'Euro-mob', 'father-of-the-bride', 'Well', 'done', 'already', 'more', 'promising', 'most', 'Van', 'Damme', 'work', 'past', 'decade', 'Thankfully', 'sideburns', 'do', 'not', 'endure', 'movie', 'What', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'camera', 'work', 'abrupt', 'good', 'combat', 'work', 'not', 'so', 'surprisingly', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'Van', 'Damme', 'hitman-chic', 'secret', 'bachelor', 'pad', 'cute', 'turtle', 'violin', 'collection.Then', 'cut', 'Scott', 'Adkins', 'who', 'sponge-bathing', 'catatonic', 'wife', 'bedroom', 'size', 'quadriplex', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'also', 'hitman', 'guys', 'agree', 'do', 'same', 'job', 'end', 'up', 'planning', 'doing', 'same', 'time', 'botched', 'fight', 'make', 'up', 'work', 'together', 'give', 'stars', 'flavor', 'concepts', 'were', 'clearly', 'borrowed', 'other', 'movies', 'Adkins', 'la-The', 'Professional', 'vanishing', 'acts', 'Van', 'Damme', 'rather', 'Transporter-ish', 'unwelcomed', 'female', 'guest', 'who', 'also', 'older', 'emotion-evoking', 'Natalia', 'Portman', 'Professional', 'are', 'embellishments', 'course.Some', 'interesting', 'things', 'stuck', 'out', 'movie', '1', 'filmmakers', 'really', 'tried', 'make', 'good', 'straight-to-DVD', 'action', 'flick', 'did', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dare', 'suggest', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'theaters', '2', 'Time', 'strong', 'element', 'think', 'were', 'going', 'subtle', 'motif', 'way', 'face', '3', 'hitman', 'money', 'kill', 'fill', 'other', 'void', '4', 'Van', 'Damme', ""n't"", 'been', 'working', 'out', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'Adkins.In', 'end', 'was', 'solid', 'straight-to-DVD', 'action', 'flick', 'made', 'want', 're-watch', 'Double', 'Impact', 'Undisputed', 'II', 'where', 'shined', 'brightest']",Assassination Games

Scott Adkins makes the greatest impression in the film, looking good as he hangs tortured and suspended from the ceiling, pained by his wife's death and fierce at exacting revenge.  I see he was in ""Borne Ultimatum""; and I'll have to watch it again to spot him.  Marija Karan does a nice job as October, the prostitute with no options who causes Van Damme to enter the church as the film concludes.  I'd seen her earlier this year as a Russian tennis player on the cable TV series ""Covert Affairs.""  She does a nice job.  Ivan Kaye as the major bad guy Polo Yakur who is released from a Romanian prison to be a sitting duck with competing assassins gives a good performance, albeit one with little range demanded of him.

(shrug)I mention it because several years ago I wanted to review a shockingly good Jean-Claude Van Damme flick. Believe me, it sounded crazy even as I was saying it. But the truth is - given the right vehicle and direction the man *can* act. But again, time passed, and now I'd have to look up the film's title and rewatch it in order to stand by that statement.However, the other night I screened a more recent film project and I have to say: It makes me wonder what his career would look like today, and how we would view him (not as a punchline to many a joke) had he done more work along these lines. This movie is very decent bordering on pretty good. He plays to his strengths, having maintained the prerequisite six-pack body and solid physical presence, but deftly avoids falling back into the old routine of kicking and punching his way thru a script.Not sure if he himself recognized it or he listened to someone he trusts, but the world of martial arts, as in all things, progressed. Those mile-high kicks and incredible flexibility shots have long since fallen out of favor, and quite frankly look ludicrous in today's action films where kinetic energy is mixed with new school ground-n-pound and old school Japanese jiu jitsu.Gone is the complete focus on the martial arts, gone too are his looks. The years have taken their toll and it honestly looks pretty good on him. He finally has the rugged element to match his physical ability, a world weariness similar to the transition Sam Shepard went through. And like the acclaimed writer/actor, gained depth through attrition what they couldn't muster as younger performers. They earned cred by living through hard times. Some in the craft find their ""voice"" by going through Life, and if they're very fortunate, it will lead to a second turn on the carousel. If not, oblivion, and hopefully a smooth transition back to being a regular person.In this production Jean-Claude portrays Vincent, a supremely competent mechanic who promptly executes his work, returns home and quietly prepares for his next assignment. That's it. With the exception of a tiny turtle who fears him and a collection of violins, that's the entirety of his existence.And that's about to change.He's offered a new lucrative contract. However, it's one that his business agent points out is extremely dangerous, even for a man with his skills. But the pay is double his normal fee, so there's no hesitation, he agrees to take on the assignment. Kept from him is the reason why this target has been selected for death. He's a criminal overlord who is being used as bait for yet another assassin. Said other contractor has a blood vendetta against the crime boss for beating and gang raping his wife into a permanent vegetative state. So when he learns that the scum that was responsible is to be set free from prison, it draws him out of his seclusion.Vincent doesn't realize that the job is not the real reason he's been hired. His actual purpose: A stalking horse. That doesn't become clear until the two assassins choose the exact same moment to take out the mob boss. Unfortunately, each hitter interferes with the other's kill shot. Realizing what happened, they switch their focus and decide to use their abilities against each other.Their meeting is bone-crushing and lead-laden. Each is a professional and each refuses to give up. Bloodied and sore, they begin to develop respect for the other's ability. Pausing the battle to seek out enlightenment, they do the unexpected and begin to exchange information. It's finally clear that they've both been set-up and perhaps they need to stop trying to kill each other and reassess the situation; figure out who's really pulling the strings and who is the true target.My only complaints were minor. The emotional accoutrements - the turtle and violins - were a bit of a copout, attempting to humanize Vincent's character. On one hand I appreciate that many of these individuals need some other element, some diversion not associated with the job. But on the other hand, I wonder why the need for these oft-used tropes? I often wonder how realistic this aspect is given it's been boilerplate script for hitmen in films for at least the past fifty years. Is it a truth that filmmakers have captured? Or a contrivance that has worked its way into the group consciousness of creators the world over? At least the James Bond villainScaramanga(Christopher Lee) did the job to enjoy a lavish lifestyle, ditto the scene-stealing performance by Richard Jenkins in 'Absolute Power'. Blatant avarice is a truth one can easily accept. Stringed-instruments and offbeat pets, not so much.But those tiny quirks can be forgiven because the movie delivered what it advertised.",4,Very Decent Bordering On Pretty Good,1317168000,"09 28,

It wasn't great or even ""really good"" but it was better than most of JCVD's other dtv movies(excluding US3 and Replicant)...and better than some of his later theatrical movies(Street Fighter,Double Team,Knock Off, Unisol:The Return). I think putting it on the same level as Wake of Death is pretty fair. I actually may have liked this a little more since it didn't feature the dopey MTV edits that WOD had. The acting was pretty solid all around for the most part. JC's son, Kris' character(Schell) was extremely pointless in my opinion...not to mention he sucked in it. Felt like he was reading his lines the entire movie. I really liked JC and Adkin's chemistry together. They played off each other really well but I was left wanting to see more of them sharing the screen. There were a few aspects I didn't care for but I don't want to spoil anything. Production wise, the movie looks pretty good considering the budget. It's well directed and shot. Good music score too. However, I actually feel like it would have made for a better at home experience than a theatrical one. The sepia tone actually looked a little blurred on the big screen during some of the wide shots...and I did find myself craving a little color. Close ups looked good though. All in all, it was a pretty good movie. This gives me hope for The Butcher.

1447831,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00596WEVI,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[4, 5]","In a quote on the back of the DVD case, Black Belt Magazine names this ""the best Jean-Claude Van Damme movie and the best Scott Adkins movie. Ever."" Now, I put a lot of stock in that publication, but I really can't imagine where the writer's priorities were on the day he reviewed this movie. ""Assassination Games"" is a good DTV thriller but a thoroughly disappointing martial arts action film - a definite step down from Van Damme's previousUniversal Soldier: Regenerationand Adkins' jaw-droppingUndisputed III: Redemption. Were it not for the movie's adherence to style and sound production values, I'd say for certain that it's disappointing enough to break Van Damme's recent revivalist streak.The story: two ace assassins - one calloused by the cutthroat lifestyle but still going strong (Van Damme), one left vengeful but vulnerable after his occupation took its toll on his family (Adkins) - must form a shaky alliance to take down a vicious crime lord (Ivan Kaye,The Green Green Grass), unaware that they're playing into a deadly set-up by crooked cops.I must admit, the movie has many good things going for it. ""Assassination Games"" succeeds as one of the few movies made in Romania to actually look good: the cinematography and art direction are sound, bereft of the usual grey bleakness lesser films capture in the same setting. The writing is superior for a DTV flick: were I judging this as an intrigue thriller, I'd give it a higher score, and unlike in a lot of low-budget flicks, many interesting things that are referenced early in the movie end up making a meaningful comeback later down the road (e.g. the smart gun, the Van Damme character's relationship to the church). The acting is surprisingly good: Van Damme continues to channel the dark energy he first expressed inJCVDand Scott proves that he doesn't need to be doing a Russian accent to appear intense - both of them proving themselves to be capable dramatic players in a time when a lot of viewers are expecting this. Stylistically and dramatically, this film succeeds.Then you remember that you're actually supposed to be watching an action movie, and at once it seems barren. Of the entire 101-minute running time, I counted barely 7 minutes given over to actual adrenaline-pumping scenes. Of these, there are only two real fights among a meager smattering five-second beat-'em-ups, and only one of them is actually worth noting. The Van Damme/Adkins rematch makes no improvement over their earlier scuffle inThe Shepherd: Border Patrol. Scott has a few cool moves throughout the movie, including a painful-looking flying dropkick, but none of these come up in his over-edited brawl with Jean-Claude which once again does not take advantage of the capacities of its performers. I do believe that director Ernie Barbarash (Cube Zero) was aware of the significance of having these two starring in the same movie, but it seems as though he was too caught up in trying to make the film seem legitimate to capitalize on the actual action aspect of his action movie.I think there are enough fans out there of both of the main stars who'll like this one enough to keep it from being a pitfall in either of their careers, but I declare myself let down. My cinematic opus of Van Damme/Adkins martial artistry is apparently never to be, leaving me more than a bit disheartened.

crew so that the results are quite good.The plot involves the head of Interpol,under investigation for selling and profiting through illegal arms sales.There is an open end he wants closed,in the form of an assassin for hire named Roland Flint.Flint took the proceeds from a sale gone bad and went into hiding after his wife was brutally raped(and left in a coma)and Flint himself almost killed,by a local Romanian thug by the name of Polo.Simultaneously we have another assassin for hire in the picture and his name is Vincent Brazil(Van Damme).Brazil`s oft used contact for jobs gives him the assignment of coincidentally killing Polo.At the same time Flint is also given the job by an old Interpol contact,but does not know who his target is or that there is another involved.Flint`s job is in actuality a ruse by the head of Interpol and two agents in on his corruption scheme,to snuff out Flint so they can get rid of their loose end once and for all.The moment of truth arrives as Polo is set up above and across of the assassination location.Out walks Polo,Flint lines his shot and fires but hits the roof of a small truck as it rounds the corner and into his line of fire.The driver is none other than Brazil who,distracted by Flint`s shot,misses and kills Polo`s only brother instead,speeding off.Frustrated Polo comes downstairs,gun in hand and walks towards the startled crowd.As he lifts his weapon to fire the two Interpol agents in a car near the scene,fire knocking the gun out of his hand.This creates enough of a diversion to enable Flint to escape.Polo is of course bent on revenge and finding out who killed his brother,Flint is more enraged than ever because his target is his old nemesis and he missed,Brazil is mad because of the interloper who cost him a kill and Interpol STILL wants Flint silenced.Brazil catches up to Flint and they briefly have a Mexican stand off in a warehouse.They hash out their differences and decide to work together to bring Polo down.However Polo is not standing still and has his men searching for any clues to Brazil and his whereabouts and distributing pictures of him all over town.Eventually it is a disgruntled neighbour of Brazil`s that discloses his whereabouts.Also Brazil`s jobs contact has offered him a substantial remuneration if he turns his new `partner`(Flint) in.All he has to do is get him to a location and the rest will be done by the ``employer``.Brazil at this point has no idea of the Interpol connection(the ``employer``in this case),Polo`s involvement with them or with Flint`s history with either.Polo`s appearance is the ruse to again lure Flint out and Flint is captured with little struggle as Brazil looks coldly on,another job done.Flint is taken to a remote warehouse and tortured for info on the whereabouts of the money he took from them long ago.Brazil has had time to think and approaches his jobs man once again and asks for the location of the warehouse.Brazil has now absorbed enough information to determine the connections and that he was set up and in turn set up his ``partner`` and does not like it.He rescues Flint and they kill the interrogating Interpol agents.Next on the list is Polo himself,but he is seemingly one step ahead and he has found Flint`s home and is with his comatose wife,threatening to kill her altogether this time.This brings Flint and Brazil back to Flint`s home and together unarmed,they are forced to walk into Polo`s clutches.Polo is delighted at the thought of being able to take care of two birds with one stone but he hasn`t counted on the resourcefulness of the pair.Flint had previously installed a high powered remote controlled rifle outside his home and with the touch of a remote laying on the table(which Polo thought was nothing but a phone),it gives them the distraction they both need to get the upper hand and bring control to their situation.Polo is the last alive,defiant to the end and Brazil leaves him with Flint as he steps outside for air.When Flint rejoins Brazil,Brazil says there is one more thing left to do;actually one thing each.Flint takes down the head of Interpol and Brazil takes out the disgruntled neighbour who squealed to Polo about where he lived.The film ends as we see Flint talking to a medical specialist about an important operation for his wife and as Brazil lights a candle in a church for a dead friend and leaves.Both Brazil and Flint are characters that are fleshed out very nicely,and as a result two people we can easily identify with.Flint`s life as a hired gun,was totally shattered since the day he,and especially his wife was attacked and she was put into a permanent bed ridden state;and his face and mannerisms show it.He lives day to day in a protective mode;a loving husband dutifully looking after his partner.Brazil on the other hand is a hired gun like Flint,but the years of killing and torment show in his well worn face.He is a methodical man as we see when he first comes home and straightens little items up in his apartment as he goes through it.He has no personal life and is very much the loner.With these characters fleshed out as they are and expanded on wonderfully by Van Damme and Rudin,there is no where to go but up.The two,though similar are very different,but they blend together well when the rubber hits the road.Polo,played with great menace and panache by Ivan Kaye,is also a welcome protagonist for the two along with the Interpol chief.To give the movie an even better dynamic the entire movie was filmed in a filtered or sepia-like colour tone.Nice.Technically speaking the movie looks clear and crisp and is in its original a/r of 1:85:1.Extras include the trailer,previews and some deleted scenes.Another nice vehicle for Van Damme who has Scott Rudin along for the ride this time, and who comes up to the challenge with extra to spare.The entire cast is as solid as the writing/plot.Recommended.",4,"Assassination Games, a solid

Waiters are getting patted down. One waiter (Jean-Claude Van Damme), skilled in knives, cuts the throat of the big boss and escapes to his secret apartment...meanwhile another assassin, Flint lives in seclusion caring for his comatose wife (Bianca Van Varenberg).Also going on is a quick scene involving Interpol corruption scandal and an investigation. Seems the Interpol is selling guns that they seize back to the criminals. They are afraid that Flint(Scott Adkins) can take them down, so they order his assassination. In order to flush him out they release a crime boss named Polo (Ivan Kaye) from prison, who had gang raped and beat Flint's wife comatose. In addition to Flint, Jean-Claude Van Damme, who gets paid in diamonds, is also summoned to do the Polo assassination. Polo is hunting the man (Van-Damme) who killed his brother in the first scene, but doesn't know who performed the deed.Now if this wasn't enough, Van Damme is distracted by his new neighbors, a prostitute (Marija Karan) and a pimp who beats her. Van Damme doesn't want Flint to kill Polo or else he loses his fee, so he goes after Flint too. Flint realizes Interpol set him up by freeing Polo, so he wants to kill them too. Got all that?Unlikely alliances form to narrow down the factions. Outside of Van Damme, the acting was acceptable. While the plot sounds complex, it really isn't that hard to follow, unless you have problems following Steven Seagal movies. It takes a while to build up all the factions and reasons for wanting to kill each other, but once it does things move rather quickly.F-bomb (with Ukrainian accent), violence against women (its a Van Damme film), brief nudity, torture.",3,PEOPLE CHOOSE HOW TO DIE WHEN THEY CHOOSE HOW TO LIVE,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1803,"['movie', 'fast', 'lot', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'beginning.The', 'film', 'Ukrainian', 'wedding', 'scene', 'Waiters', 'are', 'getting', 'patted', 'down', 'One', 'waiter', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'skilled', 'knives', 'throat', 'big', 'boss', 'escapes', 'secret', 'apartment', 'meanwhile', 'assassin', 'Flint', 'seclusion', 'caring', 'comatose', 'wife', 'Bianca', 'Van', 'Varenberg', 'going', 'quick', 'scene', 'involving', 'Interpol', 'corruption', 'scandal', 'investigation', 'Interpol', 'selling', 'guns', 'seize', 'back', 'criminals', 'are', 'afraid', 'Flint', 'Scott', 'Adkins', 'can', 'take', 'down', 'order', 'assassination', 'order', 'flush', 'out', 'release', 'crime', 'boss', 'named', 'Polo', 'Ivan', 'Kaye', 'prison', 'who', 'had', 'gang', 'raped', 'beat', 'Flint', 'wife', 'comatose', 'addition', 'Flint', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'who', 'paid', 'diamonds', 'also', 'summoned', 'do', 'Polo', 'assassination', 'Polo', 'hunting', 'man', 'Van-Damme', 'who', 'killed', 'brother', 'first', 'scene', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'performed', 'deed.Now', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Van', 'Damme', 'distracted', 'new', 'neighbors', 'prostitute', 'Marija', 'Karan', 'pimp', 'who', 'Van', 'Damme', ""n't"", 'want', 'Flint', 'kill', 'Polo', 'else', 'fee', 'Flint', 'too', 'Flint', 'Interpol', 'set', 'up', 'freeing', 'Polo', 'kill', 'too', 'Got', 'Unlikely', 'alliances', 'form', 'narrow', 'down', 'factions', 'Van', 'Damme', 'acting', 'was', 'acceptable', 'plot', 'complex', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'hard', 'follow', 'have', 'problems', 'following', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'movies', 'while', 'build', 'up', 'factions', 'reasons', 'wanting', 'kill', 'other', 'once', 'things', 'move', 'rather', 'quickly.F-bomb', 'Ukrainian', 'accent', 'violence', 'women', 'Van', 'Damme', 'film', 'brief', 'nudity', 'torture']",Assassination Games

1447844,A7CE4BIT8BCSB,B00596WEVI,"W. J. Barnaby ""Qigong""","[21, 21]","Having resigned myself to accepting the Van Damme heyday was over and the remainder of his career would be limited to less than average DTV releases, along comes Assassination Games to revive my crestfallen heart andprove low budget action does not have to be mindless, derivitive, and action-less abhorrations of film where the producer's only goal was to create a 90 minute timeline that could be packaged and labeled as a 'movie.'While many are quick to categorize this film as standard action fare, nothing about it is standard: the dialogue, while just a notch above average, is coherent and well paced; the direction is competent; and the supporting players can actually act, entertaining you when the leads aren't on screen.  I disagree with the reviewer who stated the lead villain (Polo Yakur, played by Ivan Kaye), was nothing more than a 'typical' heavy, because Kaye - while admittedly serving a narrow spectrum in the film - did inflect subtleties to make the character seem a grieving human being rather than just another over the top villain strutting around for the sake of malevolence.It's true there isn't much fighting in this movie, but the fighting that is present serves purpose rather than being a fight scene dropped into the storyline simply to satisfy machismo.  Because this movie works, you don't pine for more fighting or action, you want to see what happens to the characters.  You become transfixed on the action but are satisfied with an even bigger bang when you learn where the action is leading.  It's a mix that we rarely see in any DTV release nowadays, and I'm surprised this film was not given wider distribution in theaters.As a Jean-Claude Van Damme film, I'm happy to say it is, beyond doubt, the best he has done in a long time.  While The Shepard was watchable despite its predictable flaws, even die hard fans must admit to disappointment during a long dry spell of DTV crap where the only saving grace was Van Damme himself, lost amidst amateurish, no-talent schlock.  With this single film, his heinous mistakes of the past - Derailed, Until Death, etc - are forgotten and forgiven.  As a Scott Adkins film, it shows how good an actor he can be, thank goodness, something desperately needed in this genre  when the action hero isn't kicking somebody around.  As a team, the two performed well together and, I daresay, I'd be happy to see those two characters together again in a sequel.
