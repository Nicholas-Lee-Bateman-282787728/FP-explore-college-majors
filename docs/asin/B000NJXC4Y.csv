Dark Corners (2006) was pure discarded film school material with Thora Birch suddenly moving back and forth between two different people having two different hairstyles.  So, we've got a fuzzy killer that looks like a deadly Hip Hop Dance hall DJ from New Jersey, and a girl who hides from the killer in a dream.  Oh, scary.The film stagnates due to being shot on a lousy digital camera, so it views like an inferior home video, and really bad acting makes this film difficult to watch.The dull story played out as if it had been made up as it went along from scene to scene, the gore/fx were poor and unbelievable, and the so-called anxiety sequences were supremely lacking in zest or vivacity.Absolutely no plot whatsoever except the deadly Hip Hop killer randomly killing people in gruesome ways.

1057563,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000NJXC4Y,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Dark Corners (Ray Gower, 2006)This movie had almost bottomless potential-- done right, it could have been one of those indie gems that becomes a cult favorite. There are flashes of that brilliance throughout the movie. But it never quite reaches its true potential, and there are times when it gets so badly derailed that it's incapable of getting back on track. Because of this, it's one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in recent memory, while I have to give writer/director Ray Gower respect for having had the ambition to take on such a formidable project in his first attempt at writing and directing a movie.Thora Birch (American Beauty) plays two roles here. Susan Hamilton is a happily-married woman who's trying to get pregnant. When she falls asleep, she adopts an alter ego, Karen Clarke, who lives on the (very, very) bad side of town, works for a crazy undertaker, and is constantly followed by strange characters whose intentions are never certain. As the film goes on, we begin to wonder which of these realities is the ""real"" one, or whether Susan Hamilton and Karen Clarke are actually doppelgangers living in the same town. And what's the deal with the Night Stalker, the serial killer active in the city? What does he have to do with the story?There's so much here. Gower has a wonderful ear for dialogue; there are scenes here that rival the best of Tarantino, as far as the script goes. The acting ranges from the competent to the brilliant; Birch, especially, has rarely been better. The cinematography is always interesting, if a bit obvious in its influences.And therein lies some of the weak spots that pock the film; it's a little too much at times, in every respect. It's not just the cinematography. The symbolism rears out of the shadows and whacks you across the face every now and again. The script loses focus. The dialogue wears thin. In every case, the film gets back on track quickly, but each of the slips adds up. And then, by the time we get to the major derangement, it's all added up to the point where the movie drops out completely. It's unable to recover, and it just keeps spiraling downwards. But despite that, there's so much here that says that Gower's going to be a heavy hitter some day that I'm really looking forward to his next movie, to see if he's managed to control some of the downsides while not losing the upsides. ** ",3,"Better than I expected, not as good as I hoped.",1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2386,"['Dark', 'Corners', 'Ray', 'Gower', '2006', 'movie', 'had', 'almost', 'bottomless', 'potential', 'done', 'right', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'indie', 'gems', 'cult', 'favorite', 'are', 'flashes', 'brilliance', 'movie', 'never', 'quite', 'true', 'potential', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'so', 'badly', 'derailed', 'incapable', 'getting', 'back', 'track', 'one', 'most', 'disappointing', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'memory', 'have', 'give', 'writer/director', 'Ray', 'Gower', 'respect', 'having', 'had', 'ambition', 'take', 'formidable', 'project', 'first', 'attempt', 'writing', 'directing', 'movie.Thora', 'Birch', 'American', 'Beauty', 'two', 'roles', 'here', 'Susan', 'Hamilton', 'happily-married', 'woman', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'pregnant', 'When', 'asleep', 'alter', 'ego', 'Karen', 'Clarke', 'who', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'side', 'town', 'crazy', 'undertaker', 'constantly', 'followed', 'strange', 'characters', 'intentions', 'are', 'never', 'certain', 'film', 'begin', 'wonder', 'realities', 'real', 'one', 'Susan', 'Hamilton', 'Karen', 'Clarke', 'are', 'actually', 'doppelgangers', 'living', 'same', 'town', 'what', 'deal', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'serial', 'killer', 'active', 'city', 'What', 'have', 'do', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'Gower', 'wonderful', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'are', 'scenes', 'here', 'rival', 'best', 'Tarantino', 'as', 'far', 'script', 'acting', 'ranges', 'competent', 'brilliant', 'Birch', 'especially', 'rarely', 'been', 'better', 'cinematography', 'always', 'interesting', 'bit', 'obvious', 'influences.And', 'therein', 'weak', 'spots', 'pock', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'respect', 'not', 'just', 'cinematography', 'symbolism', 'shadows', 'whacks', 'face', 'now', 'again', 'script', 'focus', 'dialogue', 'wears', 'thin', 'case', 'film', 'back', 'track', 'quickly', 'slips', 'up', 'then', 'time', 'get', 'major', 'derangement', 'added', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'out', 'completely', 'unable', 'recover', 'just', 'spiraling', 'downwards', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'Gower', 'going', 'be', 'heavy', 'hitter', 'day', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'movie', 'see', 'managed', 'control', 'downsides', 'not', 'losing', 'upsides', '**']",Dark Corners
