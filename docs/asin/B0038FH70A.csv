This film is scripted as though the writer ate a heavy dinner and fell asleep while reading Hemmingway, with the resulting nightmares being this film. The story is about a group of four pilots released by the service at the end of World War I that, instead of going home, hang around in Europe drinking heavily and wasting their time with a woman even more annoying than the overall experience of watching this movie - Nikki (Helen Chandler). Ms. Chandler seems to be doing a bad imitation of Billie Burke here. While Ms. Burke was always interesting and whimsical in her roles, Nikki is just a simple and rather flippant ditz whose act gets old in a hurry.Just knowing the background of the film I know where this story is trying to go, but there is no context to let you know these guys are numbing themselves to forget the war and anything that might matter. Instead, you are left with man-child behavior and dialogue that would make Judd Apatow blush. Only at the end is there any attempt to tie everything together in a touching scene between ex-pilot Cary (Richard Barthelmess) and Nikki. My recommendation is to steer clear of this one.The video and audio on this 1931 film are in excellent shape. There are no extra features on this DVD-R release, and there are no chapter stops.

1330333,A3628L43ZVEMP5,B0038FH70A,Christopher Twelvetrees,"[0, 0]","Democrats tend toward evil.  Kennedy got America into Viet Nam, Truman got American in Korea.  My grandfather, as poor a farmer as any (who farmed just so his family could eat what he produced and not starve during Roosevelt's depression) hated FDR for getting American into another European conflict.  America was always put into wars by self-styled progressives. And they are also the only people in world history to use the atomic bomb against people.One of the earliest presidents who styled himself a ""progressive"" (since the Democrats' Al Goresque William Jennings Bryan was defeated three times) was Woodrow Wilson, a snooty, donnish type who thought he knew better than anyone else (as this review is written in 2013, you can draw your own parallels).  William Jennings Bryan was his Secretary of State -- but, to Bryan's credit, he resigned with Wilson broke a campaign promise and embroiled America unnecessarily in the European war of 1914-1918.Very little good can be said about America's involvement in World War I, except that lots of good literature came from the ""lost generation"" that followed it.  F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dos Passos and others came from that period.  Hemingway was particularly incisive with his novel THE SUN ALSO RISES.Almost a carbon copy of THE SUN ALSO RISES was John Monk Saunders' THE SINGLE LADY.  It was about bored and damaged people partying to forget their meaningless lives.  And since John Monk Saunders had an entree to Hollywood (he won the Oscar for writing ""The Dawn Patrol"") he was able to get his novel on screen as ""The Last Flight.""""The Last Flight"" is about four men and a woman boozing through Paris and down to the bullfights in Lisbon (sounds a lot like Hemingway's book, huh?) and it has little more story than that.  The men. John Mack Brown, later a western star given a sort of immortality in a Statler Brothers song.  David Manners might be recognizable to those who are into obscure horror flicks. Richard Barthelmess was a silent movie actor who had been in ""The Dawn Patrol"" and continued on into talkies until the '40s.  Barthelmess' character is named ""Cary"" and that character name is alleged to be where Archie Leach got the idea to change his name to Cary . . . Grant.  The woman, Helen Chandler, is most famous for being pursued by Bela Lugosi's ""Dracula.""So-called ""silent movies"" had developed into a high art.  They were smooth and capable.  When the talkie era started, the movies had to learn their art all over again, using clunky microphones and actors who could speak rather than merely emote.  Made in the first years of the talkie era, ""The Last Flight"" suffers from the crudity of these early days.  The dialogue, instead of flowing, is punctuated by unnatural pauses.  Despite winning an Oscar, John Monk Saunders' dialogue is stilted.  The girl's dialogue is meant to be flippant but it comes off in a series of nutty-sounding non sequiturs, including the justly famous, ""I'll take vanilla.""If you can take the early-talkie crudity of the production, or if you have an historical view of flim, it's worth giving this picture a try.  Otherwise, despite an attempt at an exciting ending, you might want to give it a pass.",4,Good if you can stand crude movie-making,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,3215,"['Democrats', 'tend', 'evil', 'Kennedy', 'got', 'America', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'Truman', 'got', 'American', 'Korea', 'grandfather', 'poor', 'farmer', 'who', 'farmed', 'just', 'so', 'family', 'could', 'eat', 'what', 'produced', 'not', 'starve', 'Roosevelt', 'depression', 'hated', 'FDR', 'getting', 'American', 'European', 'conflict', 'America', 'was', 'always', 'put', 'wars', 'self-styled', 'progressives', 'are', 'also', 'only', 'people', 'world', 'history', 'use', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'people.One', 'earliest', 'presidents', 'who', 'styled', 'progressive', 'Democrats', 'Al', 'Goresque', 'William', 'Jennings', 'Bryan', 'was', 'defeated', 'three', 'times', 'was', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'snooty', 'donnish', 'type', 'who', 'thought', 'knew', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'review', 'written', '2013', 'can', 'draw', 'own', 'parallels', 'William', 'Jennings', 'Bryan', 'was', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Bryan', 'credit', 'resigned', 'Wilson', 'broke', 'campaign', 'promise', 'embroiled', 'America', 'unnecessarily', 'European', 'war', '1914-1918.Very', 'little', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'America', 'involvement', 'World', 'War', 'lots', 'good', 'literature', 'came', 'lost', 'generation', 'followed', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hemingway', 'Dos', 'Passos', 'others', 'came', 'period', 'Hemingway', 'was', 'particularly', 'incisive', 'novel', 'THE', 'SUN', 'ALSO', 'RISES.Almost', 'carbon', 'copy', 'THE', 'SUN', 'ALSO', 'RISES', 'was', 'John', 'Monk', 'Saunders', 'THE', 'SINGLE', 'LADY', 'was', 'about', 'bored', 'damaged', 'people', 'partying', 'forget', 'meaningless', 'lives', 'John', 'Monk', 'Saunders', 'had', 'entree', 'Hollywood', 'won', 'Oscar', 'writing', 'Dawn', 'Patrol', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'novel', 'screen', 'Last', 'Flight', 'Last', 'Flight', 'four', 'men', 'woman', 'boozing', 'Paris', 'down', 'bullfights', 'Lisbon', 'lot', 'Hemingway', 'book', 'huh', 'little', 'more', 'story', 'men', 'John', 'Mack', 'Brown', 'later', 'western', 'star', 'given', 'sort', 'immortality', 'Statler', 'Brothers', 'song', 'David', 'Manners', 'might', 'be', 'recognizable', 'who', 'are', 'obscure', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Richard', 'Barthelmess', 'was', 'silent', 'movie', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'Dawn', 'Patrol', 'continued', 'talkies', ""'40s"", 'Barthelmess', 'character', 'named', 'Cary', 'character', 'name', 'alleged', 'be', 'where', 'Archie', 'Leach', 'got', 'idea', 'change', 'name', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'woman', 'Helen', 'Chandler', 'most', 'famous', 'being', 'pursued', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'Dracula', 'So-called', 'silent', 'movies', 'had', 'developed', 'high', 'art', 'were', 'smooth', 'capable', 'When', 'talkie', 'era', 'started', 'movies', 'had', 'learn', 'art', 'over', 'again', 'using', 'clunky', 'microphones', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'speak', 'rather', 'merely', 'emote', 'Made', 'first', 'years', 'talkie', 'era', 'Last', 'Flight', 'suffers', 'crudity', 'early', 'days', 'dialogue', 'instead', 'flowing', 'punctuated', 'unnatural', 'pauses', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'John', 'Monk', 'Saunders', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'girl', 'dialogue', 'meant', 'be', 'flippant', 'off', 'series', 'nutty-sounding', 'non', 'sequiturs', 'including', 'justly', 'famous', ""'ll"", 'take', 'vanilla', 'can', 'take', 'early-talkie', 'crudity', 'production', 'have', 'historical', 'view', 'flim', 'worth', 'giving', 'picture', 'try', 'Otherwise', 'attempt', 'exciting', 'ending', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'pass']",The Last Flight
1330334,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B0038FH70A,Douglas M,"[9, 9]","""The Last Flight"", a 1931 Warner Brothers production, is a very special film full of interesting and unusual features. This is a film which has generated in recent years much comment, often heralded as a forgotten masterpiece. I recommend that any potential viewer do some research first because otherwise, they may dismiss it as poor entertainment which would be missing the point. Here are some points of intrigue:- the film is possibly the best celluloid record of the ""Lost Generation"", the men who survived World War 1 but returned to civilisation with no future, mentally shattered from their experience (nothing has changed). This is the generation described by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway in some of their novels.- the film was the American debut of the German William Diertele. The lighting and staging have a Germanic look and there are some terrific transitions using clever dissolves.- the star of the film is the enigmatic Richard Barthelmess, superbly cast as the ""leader"" of 4 comrades plus one interloper played by the venal Walter Byron. This is pre-code Hollywood and the interloper is a sex predator while all the others want to do is ""get tight"" and stay that way.- the female lead is played by Helen Chandler, a wealthy playgirl as lost as the men but with some hope for the future. Chandler's part is extraordinarily complex and she is stunning.- the script if full of non-sequiturs with no discernable plot, reflecting the vacuum in which these characters exist.This is a film which requires careful attention. It is an extraordinary document but it is no wonder that it was a box office flop because this is anything but shallow Hollywood entertainment. For those who wish to park any preconceived notions, it could be a very moving experience.The film has been released in the no frills Warner's Archive Collection. This means the print is unrestored, there are no extras and it is very expensive. In this case, the print is adequate.",4,Documentary or entertainment - you be the judge.,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,1972,"['Last', 'Flight', '1931', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'production', 'very', 'special', 'film', 'full', 'interesting', 'unusual', 'features', 'film', 'generated', 'recent', 'years', 'much', 'comment', 'often', 'heralded', 'forgotten', 'masterpiece', 'recommend', 'potential', 'viewer', 'do', 'research', 'first', 'otherwise', 'may', 'dismiss', 'poor', 'entertainment', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'point', 'Here', 'are', 'points', 'intrigue', 'film', 'possibly', 'best', 'celluloid', 'record', 'Lost', 'Generation', 'men', 'who', 'survived', 'World', 'War', '1', 'returned', 'civilisation', 'future', 'mentally', 'shattered', 'experience', 'nothing', 'changed', 'generation', 'described', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'novels.-', 'film', 'was', 'American', 'debut', 'German', 'William', 'Diertele', 'lighting', 'staging', 'have', 'Germanic', 'look', 'are', 'terrific', 'transitions', 'using', 'clever', 'dissolves.-', 'star', 'film', 'enigmatic', 'Richard', 'Barthelmess', 'superbly', 'cast', 'leader', '4', 'comrades', 'one', 'interloper', 'played', 'venal', 'Walter', 'Byron', 'pre-code', 'Hollywood', 'interloper', 'sex', 'predator', 'others', 'want', 'do', 'get', 'tight', 'stay', 'way.-', 'female', 'lead', 'played', 'Helen', 'Chandler', 'wealthy', 'playgirl', 'as', 'lost', 'men', 'hope', 'future', 'Chandler', 'part', 'extraordinarily', 'complex', 'stunning.-', 'script', 'full', 'non-sequiturs', 'discernable', 'plot', 'reflecting', 'vacuum', 'characters', 'exist.This', 'film', 'careful', 'attention', 'extraordinary', 'document', 'wonder', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'flop', 'anything', 'shallow', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment', 'who', 'wish', 'park', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'moving', 'experience.The', 'film', 'been', 'released', 'frills', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'print', 'unrestored', 'are', 'extras', 'very', 'expensive', 'case', 'print', 'adequate']",The Last Flight
