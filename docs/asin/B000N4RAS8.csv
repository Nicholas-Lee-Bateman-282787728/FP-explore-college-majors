1053404,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B000N4RAS8,J. B. Hoyos,"[3, 3]","This disaster double feature is a great addition to the collection of anyone who enjoys such epic adventures as ""Towering Inferno, ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" and ""Earthquake.""  Both movies have big name actors and great special effects.  If you suffer from claustrophobia, don't watch these movies.  Disaster survivors are trapped beneath earth and water and must battle hard to live.  My favorite is ""Daylight"" because it is very reminescent of ""The Poseidon Adventure.""  Instead of Reverend Scott trying to lead people to safety, you have Kit Latura.  I also enjoy listening to the theme song for ""Daylight"" - ""Whenever There is Love.""

1053411,A2QNRB4DJ2VXQI,B000N4RAS8,"Peter Rodda ""rock doctor""","[0, 0]","Being a geologist (though not a volcanologist), I naturally went to see Dante's Peak when is first came to cinemas.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, both for the plot and for the convincing images of a volcanic eruption and its results.  Except, that is, for the lava flow, which was quite inappropriate for a volcano of Dante's Peak type - I didn't quite scream in indignation when I saw it.  Additionally, I'm not sure about the lake being so acidic as to dissolve the boat and flesh (near the end of the film).  Apart from these two objections, I consider it a very good exposition of the dangers of a volcanologist's work and the problems arising when an eruption appears to be imminent.  The story - strange events begin occurring, alerting the volcanologist and leading him to believe that an eruption, which with that type of volcano would be dangerously explosive, was imminent.  A large town lies close to the volcano.  The people must be warned - but how forcefully and with how much urgency?  Anyone forecasting a volcanic eruption or an earthquake has to fear giving a false alarm or leading people to think that the danger is closer than it turns out to be - or, of course, that it is further away.  Panic must be avoided but so too must giving a sense of false security.Daylight, another disaster movie, I didn't see until I bought the DVD.  Disaster in a vehicular tunnel, with all the bad things that can happen and the bravery of people overcoming the dangers.  Also very enjoyable;  I'm very glad that I bought the pair.",5,Explosive action,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,1531,"['Being', 'geologist', 'not', 'volcanologist', 'naturally', 'went', 'see', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'cinemas', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'plot', 'convincing', 'images', 'volcanic', 'eruption', 'results', 'Except', 'lava', 'flow', 'was', 'quite', 'inappropriate', 'volcano', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'type', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'scream', 'indignation', 'when', 'saw', 'Additionally', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'lake', 'being', 'so', 'acidic', 'dissolve', 'boat', 'flesh', 'end', 'film', 'Apart', 'two', 'objections', 'consider', 'very', 'good', 'exposition', 'dangers', 'volcanologist', 'work', 'problems', 'arising', 'when', 'eruption', 'be', 'imminent', 'story', 'strange', 'events', 'begin', 'occurring', 'alerting', 'volcanologist', 'leading', 'believe', 'eruption', 'type', 'volcano', 'would', 'be', 'dangerously', 'explosive', 'was', 'imminent', 'large', 'town', 'close', 'volcano', 'people', 'must', 'be', 'warned', 'how', 'forcefully', 'how', 'much', 'urgency', 'Anyone', 'forecasting', 'volcanic', 'eruption', 'earthquake', 'fear', 'giving', 'false', 'alarm', 'leading', 'people', 'think', 'danger', 'closer', 'out', 'be', 'course', 'further', 'away', 'Panic', 'must', 'be', 'avoided', 'so', 'too', 'must', 'giving', 'sense', 'false', 'security.Daylight', 'disaster', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Disaster', 'vehicular', 'tunnel', 'bad', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'bravery', 'people', 'overcoming', 'dangers', 'Also', 'very', 'enjoyable', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'bought', 'pair']",Dante's Peak / Daylight Double Feature
