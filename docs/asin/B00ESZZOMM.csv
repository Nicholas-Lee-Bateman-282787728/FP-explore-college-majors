Mcgorm ""tiddles""","[4, 5]","Well to tell the truth I didn't want the four pack but only one, so to get what I wanted I had to buy all, Now the other three movies are D grade something to watch at a later day but the other one, the naked cage is great. Because of  another persons statement a young woman is sent to prison  innocent of all charges. But trapped on the inside with all to hell to go along with it. With the action that follows is thick and fast, Plenty of suspense and thrills not knowing what's coming next, edge of the seat entertainment. The cast did a fabulous job with the storyline making it even better. Different and worth watching for sheer delight. I rated this an A grade for the motives and ideas that were created in the movie. Now I have told you something about it it's time to get a move on for the popcorn, plus a chair to relax on with  your feet up intriguing, unusual  so different from other shows a grand classic, A fantastic show waiting to be watched.

1668635,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B00ESZZOMM,The Phantom,"[2, 2]","This is a very uneven collection of films with no common theme. Three are entertaining. One is a perplexing throwaway.The best of this lot is &#34;Angels From Hell,&#34; and I have to admit my surprise in saying so. The oldest in the collection (released 1968), it lacks the sex appeal (i.e. nudity) of the other three, but does feature some stunningly-gorgeous women including the jaw-dropper Arlene Martel who I am convinced is among the most beautiful women in history. It does have an interesting story, if you could call it that, and is very well-acted. A biker (Tom Stern) who plays by his own set of rules returns home and retakes control of his old motorcycle gang. There is really no linear plot beyond that, but it held my interest for the duration. I was especially impressed with Jack Starrett as the tough-but-fair sheriff.&#34;Chatterbox&#34; (1976) is the oddball of the collection but then again, in cinematic history, &#34;Chatterbox&#34; ranks among the biggest oddballs anyway. It's about a woman's vagina that one day begins talking and singing. The woman (the gorgeous Candice Rialson) is more or less along for the ride as her genitalia becomes a star. Funny (often in an &#34;OMG&#34; kind of way), entertaining and lots and lots of Rialson topless. Unfortunately, never bottomless. Not really, anyway. So we never actually get to see the &#34;Chatterbox&#34; in question, which is my only real qualm.&#34;The Naked Cage&#34; (1985) is a women-in-prison movie that really is about five to eight years behind its time. Follows a young women wrongly accused of partaking in a bank robbery and murder, and the effort of the woman who actually orchestrated it to kill her while both are behind bars in a prison that, from the looks of things, isn't any more secure than a car impound lot. As you might imagine there is a substantial amount of nudity and violence, including some kind of disturbing subplots involving a serial rapist crooked cop. This is an OK release to me, but I'm not a fan of WIP.&#34;Savage Island&#34; (1985) is the one here that I could do without. It's another WIP, but a really bad one. I haven't studied the history but it appears as though the jungle prison portions, which are dubbed, made up an entirely different (and, I suspect, much older) movie that was glued together with bookend footage of Linda Blair, who is enacting revenge on the jewel magnate who profits from the prison. None of it makes any sense and there isn't even enough quality nudity to hold my attention span. Not only that, the quality of transfer is pretty atrocious.Overall, though, considering that these movies aren't readily available, this is a strong collection.",4,"Two good, one average, one bad",1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,2689,"['very', 'uneven', 'collection', 'films', 'common', 'theme', 'Three', 'are', 'entertaining', 'One', 'perplexing', 'throwaway.The', 'best', 'lot', '34', 'Angels', 'Hell', '34', 'have', 'admit', 'surprise', 'saying', 'so', 'oldest', 'collection', 'released', '1968', 'sex', 'appeal', 'i.e', 'nudity', 'other', 'three', 'feature', 'stunningly-gorgeous', 'women', 'including', 'jaw-dropper', 'Arlene', 'Martel', 'who', 'am', 'convinced', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'history', 'have', 'interesting', 'story', 'could', 'call', 'very', 'well-acted', 'biker', 'Tom', 'Stern', 'who', 'own', 'set', 'rules', 'returns', 'home', 'retakes', 'control', 'old', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'really', 'linear', 'plot', 'held', 'interest', 'duration', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'Jack', 'Starrett', 'tough-but-fair', 'sheriff.', '34', 'Chatterbox', '34', '1976', 'oddball', 'collection', 'then', 'again', 'cinematic', 'history', '34', 'Chatterbox', '34', 'ranks', 'biggest', 'oddballs', 'anyway', 'woman', 'vagina', 'one', 'day', 'talking', 'singing', 'woman', 'gorgeous', 'Candice', 'Rialson', 'more', 'less', 'ride', 'genitalia', 'star', 'Funny', 'often', '34', 'OMG', '34', 'kind', 'way', 'entertaining', 'lots', 'lots', 'Rialson', 'topless', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'bottomless', 'Not', 'really', 'anyway', 'never', 'actually', 'get', 'see', '34', 'Chatterbox', '34', 'question', 'only', 'real', 'qualm.', '34', 'Naked', 'Cage', '34', '1985', 'women-in-prison', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'five', 'eight', 'years', 'time', 'young', 'women', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'partaking', 'bank', 'robbery', 'murder', 'effort', 'woman', 'who', 'actually', 'orchestrated', 'kill', 'are', 'bars', 'prison', 'looks', 'things', ""n't"", 'more', 'secure', 'car', 'impound', 'lot', 'might', 'imagine', 'substantial', 'amount', 'nudity', 'violence', 'including', 'kind', 'disturbing', 'subplots', 'involving', 'serial', 'rapist', 'crooked', 'cop', 'OK', 'release', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'WIP.', '34', 'Savage', 'Island', '34', '1985', 'one', 'here', 'could', 'do', 'WIP', 'really', 'bad', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'studied', 'history', 'jungle', 'prison', 'portions', 'are', 'dubbed', 'made', 'up', 'entirely', 'different', 'suspect', 'much', 'older', 'movie', 'was', 'glued', 'together', 'bookend', 'footage', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'who', 'enacting', 'revenge', 'jewel', 'magnate', 'who', 'profits', 'prison', 'None', 'sense', ""n't"", 'even', 'enough', 'quality', 'nudity', 'hold', 'attention', 'span', 'Not', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'pretty', 'atrocious.Overall', 'though', 'considering', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'readily', 'available', 'strong', 'collection']","Cult Movie Marathon: Volume 2 (Savage Island, Chatterbox, The Naked Cage & Angels from Hell)"
