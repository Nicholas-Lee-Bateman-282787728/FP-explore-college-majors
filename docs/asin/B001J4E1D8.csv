1205166,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001J4E1D8,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[4, 7]","Thomas Hardy's Tess Durbeyfield has had at least three film reincarnations in the last thirty years.  All of the women portraying this woebegone heroine are beautiful--Nastassja Kinski in Polanski's feature film ""Tess (Special Edition),"" Justine Waddell (Dracula 2000) in the 1998 BBC production for television (Tess of the d'Urbervilles)  and now former Bond girl Gemma Arterton (Quantum of Solace) in this latest 212 minute version in four parts.  One thing for certain, all three of these women know exactly how to eat a strawberry with all the innocence and inadvertent provocation that would surely drive any man--from any century, repressed or not--mad with desire.Not since Nastassja Kinski has an actress depicted such nave sensuality, as does Gemma Arterton as the ill-fated Tess.  Even without speaking, Arterton epitomizes vulnerable femininity with her lovely porcelain complexion set off by long tresses of dark brown hair, punctuated by full red lips and warmed by the fathomless brown eyes of a doe. Yet this reliance on the physical to embody the spirit of Tess by no means suggests that Arterton's performance is vacuous.  Perhaps her youth, like that of the character she is portraying, works in her favor--but it is her ability to bring to the surface that quality of sweet innocence that puts her in almost the same category as the alluring girl-woman Kinski.Waddell's Tess, although beautiful in another way--remember her portrayal as Estella inGreat Expectations (Masterpiece Theatre, 1999), seems feistier, more knowing and less susceptible to the wiles of the mesmerized yet confused men in her life.  Perhaps, her eyes do not convey the same wonder at the dualities of the world.  Waddell's Tess already seems primly aggrieved by the trials and tribulations of her life; her face reflects her accrued experience.Similarly, the other actors in this ensemble will work or not work for you depending on the extent of your familiarity with and expectations of Thomas Hardy's characterizations.  If you like your Tess sweet, vulnerable and undeniably attractive, then Arterton will amply fill the bill. Hans Matheson, as the despicable Alex Stokes-D'Urberville (black-hearted misunderstood Mordred inThe Mists of Avalon) undeniably personifies the dastardly qualities of the villain with a sneering, not at all self-deprecating, self-acceptance and `who cares?' arrogance that seems true to type.  However, this reviewer found his reappearance and reinsertion in Tess's life a little hurried.  Indeed, the audience understands the feeling of obligation that Tess once felt for her family at the opportunistic prodding of her mother, but I didn't think this sense of resignation was adequately portrayed simply because it was allotted little screen time.  On the other hand, the behind the scenes glimpse through the keyhole of the boardinghouse as Alex and Tess argue as seen through the eyes of landlady, Mrs. Brooks spectacularly depicts the depravity of the cruel life Tess reluctantly endures with Alex.The role of Angel Clare played by Eddie Redmayne (POWDER BLUE,The Other Boleyn Girl) at first seems miscast.  However, his innocent scenes of love with Arterton's Tess, are bucolic to behold.  Filmed against lush fields and mooing cows, the audience sees and enjoys the purity and magnetism of the halcyon days of first love.  In contrast, Angel's hypocritical withdrawal from what could have been a wonderful life of committed sharing in another part of the world appears all the more marked as does the increased emotional release Redmayne's character must expel as he ricochets from feelings of impending doom and the simple joy of being at long last with the woman that he loves.  Redmayne's oddly shaped face showcases a boy becoming a man--possessing the same brand of innocence as his Tess.  His struggles to be of the world and above the world mature him yet do not defeat him.Other characters of note in this production are Tess's three milkmaid friends and the heartlessly cruel Groby (Christopher Fairbank) whose mere presence had this reviewer shuddering in trepidation each time he appeared on the screen.  In addition, Ruth Jones, as Tess's subtly scheming mother, portrays with distinction a conniving opportunist willing to use her daughter to gain financial happiness.Bottom line?  The 2008 BBC presentation of Thomas Hardy's ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles"" successfully conveys the storyline and emotional impact of an impoverished woman's plight in the late 19th century.  Gemma Arterton looks as if she could walk right out of a Monet painting; her beauty palpably represents the innocent insouciance of Hardy's Tess--a girl child in a woman's body.  Her male leads do not overpower her, but set off her desire for love and her innate naivety from both ends of the spiritual spectrum.  Viewers who have not read the novel be cautioned that all ends badly despite the audience's best and most hopeful wishes.  Recommended to all lovers of the Masterpiece Theatre genre as a faithful adaptation of Hardy's classic tragedy.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,Bucolic but Sad Beauty,1271203200,"04 14,

I thought the acting was generally good to very good, though some characters, at some points, were not very convincing. One of Tess's sisters looked a bit too modern for me, her hairstyle and makeup (what there was of it, of course), looking like something you might see today. One thing I felt played too big a part in this production was the music. There were times when it seemed the director was relying too heavily on the music to set the mood, and perhaps unnecessarily. Other times it was a good fit. I could not help but compare this to the Roman Polanski/Nastassja Kinski version from many years ago, and I don't know which I would choose as better, though by a narrow margin, I think it would go to the older film. I would certainly say that there is little need to see both. Naturally, being produced from the same book, the basics of the story will be the same, but I did not see any smaller points significantly exploited in such a way as to make a big difference. In the first episode of my download, I noticed some fuzziness, poor reproduction quality. I have no way of knowing whether this was the fault of the original film, or of the transmission of it to my computer. That did not influence my opinion of this overall, however. The four stars is based on performance. If you have never seen Tess, I would highly recommend seeing some version of it, whether this one or the Polanski one.

I have not seen the 1998 British version. I was intrigued before viewing with the information that one of my favorite actors Eddie Redmayne plays Angel Clare. But I am thoroughly entranced with the production so far. The production captures the contrasting beauty and harshness of the natural scene and how modern man was disconnecting from the mutually beneficial relationship with the land. Hardy's romanticism of living a simpler life connected to all Nature shines through in Tess. So far it is very true to Hardy's work without the extremes of the earlier production. Granted nothing can equal the sensuousness of the scene of Tess (Natassja Kinski) eating strawberries from Alec D'Urberville but the lushly sensual style may be over the top, making the sensual outweigh other aspects of the film. For anyone not vintage enough to have memories of Polanski's film linked to Tess, this production is an excellent viewing experience and, so far, portrayal of Hardy's ideas. Reviews always say that Tess is headstrong but I felt this is closer to Hardy's portrayal of a woman awakening to unpleasant and unfair realities of a society separated from nature and natural behavior. She tries to please her family, not rebel and the price is heavy.

I loved the 1998 adaptation of ""Tess"" as soon as I saw it, and I was really excited to see if this newer, longer, (hopefully) fresher adaptation could possibly improve on an already beautiful version.  At the same time, I was preparing myself to try not to dislike it.  Happily, I can say: though it's still not a definitive adaptation, this version definitely holds its own.Things ""Tess '08"" got right:1. A great TessGemma Arterton makes this character her own.  While Justine Waddell's Tess was delicate and sensual, Arterton plays Tess with more bite.  Both are valid interpretations of the character.  Both, however, also excel at the highly emotional scenes.  Tess is a sympathetic and brilliant character and Arterton definitely does the role justice2. Very strong supporting castThough I still like the supporting cast of the '98 version more, I loved this version's portrayal of Tess's friends Marion and Izz. Tess's family members were also well chosen, and everyone at Talbothy's diary was great!  Hans Matheson's portrayal of the morally ambiguous Alec d'Urberville is particularly noteworthy.3. An extremely strong last halfWhile it has its rough spots, the whole movie is worth it for the last hour.  It's an emotional rollercoaster.  I challenge you not to get an ache in your heart.A few things that did not please me:1. A disappointing Angel ClareEddie Redmayne just did not do it for me.  I was never convinced by Tess and Angel's romance, and the actor who played him was just...dull, and seemed slightly dim-witted.2. Extremely changed scenes and awkwardly filmed scenesHello, ""it's too late"" scene, anyone?  It was almost unrecognizable.Sometimes, throughout the movie, the dialog got a little strange, or the pacing seemed a little off. Either too abrupt, or too drawn out.Some final words:This 2008 version had many good things going for it, particularly Gemma Arterton as Tess, and it had some great scenes in there, most notably the mausoleum scene and Stongehenge scene.  But a weak Angel (Waddell and Milburne were sizzling together) and some awkwardly filmed scenes prevented this from being a terrific adaptation.  Basically, the last episode redeemed the entire series; I can't gush enough over how good it was. BUT, overall, this was a weaker adaptation compared to the '98 (my personal opinion of course!) because of the pacing issues, added/changed lines, and imperfect casting choices.  The fourth episode was by far the strongest, with Part 1 and Part 3 following.I really enjoyed watching this mini-series, though, and I appreciate the effort to stick to the story and stay true to the characters.

Poor Tess.  She's doomed, through no fault of her own.  On the other hand, the very fact that this film is ultimately so upsetting attests to the quality of the production.  If you want a happy ending, watch Jane Austen.  If you want to be depressed for a few days, watched Tess of the D'Urbervilles.You can get the plot from Wikipedia, but what it basically boils down to is this:  Tess is an innocent, beautiful young girl whose inebriated father mistakenly believes his family is descended from royalty.  Eager to better their lot in life, his sends Tess to work for the actual last descendants of the once noble D'Urbervilles, where she is unpleasantly courted and ultimately raped by the young heir.Tess runs away, has a baby out of wedlock, the baby dies and Tess, determined to make her own way, goes to work on a farm. There, she meets a man she saw once before and instantly fell in love with, and that relationship grows into an innocent, pure love.  He is the son of a wealthy family and wants to marry Tess but the morals of the time being what they are, she refuses, finally agreeing on the basis that she will share the horrible echoes of her past with her new husband.  He accepts this lovingly, but when she confesses the truths of her former immorality, he leaves her, and her life goes rapidly downhill from there.Tess ends up slaving in a cruel potato factory, where the dreadful young D'Urberville heir who raped her finds her once again.  He's still obsessed with her, and although she refuses his unrelenting advances, her longing for the husband who has deserted her ultimately drives her into his arms.  He has played the one trump card she can't refused:  He's bought her family, making their lives better while destroying Tess'.Her husband, recovering from a dreadful illness and still in love with Tess, tracks her down, begging forgiveness and anxious to start their marriage in faith.  Tess is now her enemy's mistress, filled with self-loathing and hatred for him.  She commits the ultimate crime to escape her horrible situation, killing the man she hates and fleeing to the one she loves.The young couple enjoys a period of bliss while trying desperately to escape the recriminations of the Law, and at last, Tess is taken.  She is put to death by hanging, the final page in a tragic chapter of an unreasonably misused life.This is very well done, all performances outstanding, settings magnificent, fine scripting, directing, producing.  But God, it's depressing.",3,ouch,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,2696,"['Thomas', 'Hardy', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'unhappy', 'man.Every', 'time', 'plot', 'gothic', 'period', 'story', 'might', 'take', 'happy', 'turn', 'character', 'terrible', 'choice', 'everybody', 'life', 'Poor', 'Tess', 'doomed', 'fault', 'own', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'fact', 'film', 'ultimately', 'so', 'upsetting', 'attests', 'quality', 'production', 'want', 'happy', 'ending', 'watch', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'want', 'be', 'depressed', 'few', 'days', 'watched', 'Tess', ""D'Urbervilles.You"", 'can', 'get', 'plot', 'Wikipedia', 'what', 'basically', 'down', 'Tess', 'innocent', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'inebriated', 'father', 'mistakenly', 'family', 'descended', 'royalty', 'Eager', 'better', 'lot', 'life', 'sends', 'Tess', 'work', 'actual', 'last', 'descendants', 'once', 'noble', ""D'Urbervilles"", 'where', 'unpleasantly', 'courted', 'ultimately', 'raped', 'young', 'heir.Tess', 'away', 'baby', 'wedlock', 'baby', 'dies', 'Tess', 'determined', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'work', 'farm', 'man', 'saw', 'once', 'before', 'instantly', 'fell', 'love', 'relationship', 'innocent', 'pure', 'love', 'son', 'wealthy', 'family', 'marry', 'Tess', 'morals', 'time', 'being', 'what', 'are', 'finally', 'agreeing', 'basis', 'will', 'share', 'horrible', 'echoes', 'past', 'new', 'husband', 'lovingly', 'when', 'truths', 'former', 'immorality', 'life', 'rapidly', 'downhill', 'there.Tess', 'up', 'slaving', 'cruel', 'potato', 'factory', 'where', 'dreadful', 'young', ""D'Urberville"", 'heir', 'who', 'raped', 'once', 'again', 'still', 'obsessed', 'unrelenting', 'advances', 'longing', 'husband', 'who', 'deserted', 'ultimately', 'arms', 'played', 'one', 'trump', 'card', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refused', 'bought', 'family', 'making', 'lives', 'better', 'destroying', ""Tess'.Her"", 'husband', 'recovering', 'dreadful', 'illness', 'still', 'love', 'Tess', 'down', 'begging', 'forgiveness', 'anxious', 'start', 'marriage', 'faith', 'Tess', 'now', 'enemy', 'mistress', 'filled', 'self-loathing', 'hatred', 'ultimate', 'crime', 'escape', 'horrible', 'situation', 'killing', 'man', 'fleeing', 'one', 'young', 'couple', 'period', 'bliss', 'trying', 'desperately', 'escape', 'recriminations', 'Law', 'last', 'Tess', 'taken', 'put', 'death', 'hanging', 'final', 'page', 'tragic', 'chapter', 'unreasonably', 'misused', 'life.This', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'performances', 'outstanding', 'settings', 'magnificent', 'fine', 'scripting', 'directing', 'producing', 'God', 'depressing']",Tess of the d'Urbervilles

1205212,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,B001J4E1D8,Noirdame,"[77, 92]","That haunting song has been stuck in my head ever since I saw this four-part BBC miniseries. It was a stroke of genius to incorporate this folk tune into the soundtrack (composed by Rob Lane), which sums up the mood and aura of this tragic tale of a young woman wronged so unjustly by two men. Gemma Arterton is wonderful as Tess Durbeyfield, probably Thomas Hardy's most well-loved heroine, exploited by her ignorant parents into claiming noble heritage and discarded by 19th century society. Hans Matheson is Alec Stoke-d'Urberville, the wealthy cad who violates her, unknowingly impregnates her with a child who doesn't survive babyhood and later comes back into her life as a supposedly reformed preacher. Eddie Redmayne is Angel Clare, the seemingly kind-hearted and tolerant parson's son who wins Tess's love but proves to be just as hypocritical as his religious family and his actions bring Tess to despair. As in most Hardy tales, tragedy looms a large shadow over the lives of his characters.Arterton's Tess is matched perfectly by Matheson's Alec, who is given more depth than any of the earlier film adaptations. The dark and tormented essence gives you the sense how doomed these two characters really are - their actions and words toward each other leads to their downfall. Unfortunately, the same cannot be applied to Redmayne's Angel, who looks befuddled and lost more than half the time. There is a rushed directorial pace in the second installment that hurts the romantic appeal between Tess and Angel, and the love story element seems a bit forced as a result. Because of that, I didn't get the appeal of Angel in this one, or why Tess and her fellow dairymaids were in love with him, or why Tess takes the desperate course of action in order to get him back. Some of the modern dialogue used did take away from the affect of the story, and Redmayne seemed to have a hard time keeping up with Arterton performance-wise. Redmayne redeemed himself somewhat in the final episode but for the most part I was unimpressed with him. However, director David Blair must take some of the criticism, as the hurried scenes to establish the ""romance"" seemed to skim over the parts of the novel that gave the lovers the attachment to one another that eventually leads Angel to see the error of his ways and beg his wife's forgiveness. I was anticipating Alec's return so much that I found myself not really caring if Angel came back for Tess or not. In sharp contrast, the 1998 A&E;/London Weekend Television production had me rooting for Tess and Angel's reunion even though I was aware of the outcome. I was so taken by Angel in that one, whereas here I found nothing in him to be slightly attractive or romantic. I sympathized with Tess completely and neither man deserved her, but at least in the other version and the novel I could see why she loved Angel and longed for him to return to her. I found myself almost rooting for Alec (I never thought I'd say that), because Matheson was so compelling and magnetic and he and Arterton generated such electricity, I couldn't take my eyes off them. Alec's fleeting conversion to Christianity and his sermon in the tent that Tess stumbles upon is foreshadowing of the path these two ill-fated characters will end up on. The moment he lays eyes on her again, his fatal attraction and twisted love for her resurfaces and consumes him, and Tess finds herself increasingly helpless to refuse his help after her father dies and her family is left destitute. Alec's wealth is the only way he can possess her and he is aware of that, but he is willing to get her the only way he can, only to discover that fate does indeed play a vengeful hand. It was also nice to see Tess revisiting her child's grave and placing fresh flowers upon it; her deeply felt sense of loss and rejection by both the church and her village is searingly devastating because it becomes all the more clear that she is victim of both society (in which women had few advantages) and fate. Having said that, Tess and Angel's reunion did not have the emotional impact it should have had, the sex scene was unnecessary, but the Stonehedge sequence was an emotional powerhouse for Arterton, as was the climax of her walking off to her fate with her signature tune heard wistfully in the background. The supporting cast was in top form, and while the cinematography was lovely, it could have emphasized far more considering how important landscape is in Hardy's work, as both the 1998 two part program and Roman Polanski's 1979 film have demonstrated. As a four-part miniseries, it had the opportunity to include more scenes from the novel and insight into character, particularly Angel, which would have helped the plot a great deal. However, it was good to see the mausoleum scene and the ending was heartbreaking and moving, although my tears were for Tess, her sister Liza-Lu, and, dare I say it, even Alec, but I felt nothing for Angel (although Redmayne's tearful breakdown was by far his best moment).On the whole, this was a very good presentation, my second favorite version and very much worth seeing. Arterton and Matheson give tour-de-force portrayals; it would be great if they would co-star again, some have suggested as Cathy and Heathcliff in ""Wuthering Heights"" - I could definitely see that. And that song will linger on in your memory long after the final credits have rolled, as will the rest of the score.",4,"""The Snow It Melts The Soonest . . . . . . .""",1230940800,"01 3,
