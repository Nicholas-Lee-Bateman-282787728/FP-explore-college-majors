I first found this double feature, which I had no clue existed but was so thrilled because A Boy Named Charlie Brown is just as fantastic as Snoopy Come Home, at a local electronics store for $34 and was reluctant to buy at that price. Luckily I had my trusty Amazon iPhone App and I quickly found the same product for less than half the price! The shipping was as fast as always. I am so pleased with this product!",5,Peanuts Forever!,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,527,"['had', 'been', 'dying', 'watch', 'Snoopy', 'Come', 'Home', 'past', 'summer', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'add', 'collection', 'first', 'found', 'double', 'feature', 'had', 'clue', 'existed', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'A', 'Boy', 'Named', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'just', 'as', 'fantastic', 'Snoopy', 'Come', 'Home', 'local', 'electronics', 'store', '34', 'was', 'reluctant', 'buy', 'price', 'Luckily', 'had', 'trusty', 'Amazon', 'iPhone', 'App', 'quickly', 'found', 'same', 'product', 'less', 'price', 'shipping', 'was', 'as', 'fast', 'always', 'am', 'so', 'pleased', 'product']",Peanuts Double Feature: Snoopy Come Home and A Boy Named Charlie Brown
