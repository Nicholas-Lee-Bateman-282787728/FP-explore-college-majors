Felicity, a girl who loves horses more than preparing tea, is a main character. But this is not only about her. The movie shows the struggle of women for more rights just like Samantha film, although in different times. It also shows how in spite of division of the society into Patriots (for US independence) and Loyalists - they all can celebrate Christmas together. This reminds me of Democrats vs Republican constant bickering...It also shows that every good deed will be repaid by another good deed. Sometimes it is almost naive in this aspect since we cannot expect people change so rapidly like in this movie.

Alphs,"[60, 67]","My daughter and I loved the American Girl movie "" Samantha: An American Girl Holiday"" and eagerly looked forward to ""Felicity: An American Girl Adventure"". The movie centers around 10 year old Felicity in 1775 Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia. Felicity is a tomboy, would rather spend time with the horses, however her mother wishes her to become a ""gentlewoman"" (wife, mother, housekeeper). Upon taking her ""gentlewoman lessons"" she meets Annabelle and Elizabeth Cole. The Coles are loyalists from England living in the colonies. Elizabeth and Felicity become friends however their friendship is tested when Elizabeths father is sent to prison for showing loyalty to the king. The other part of the story is that Felicity befriends an abused horse owned by Jiggy Nye. Felicity ends up befriending the horse, training the horse, unintentionally stealing her, only to have her grandfather purchase the horse for her in the end. Felicity starts out as a self centered 10 year old but she learns to put others first, she rescues her father's apprentice Ben from the bounty hunters, she visits Jiggy Nye in prison to give him food and a blanket and lastly she takes care of her family while her mother is ill. By the end of the movie Felicity has changed from a child to a ""gentlewoman"" as her mother calls her. This movie will appeal to girls as well as boys while introducing American history to them.

932393,A3P98J5DZ00A75,B000ARXFA0,"Ken Roberts ""social historian""","[37, 39]","Getting children interested in history is a tough thing to do, especially colonial American history. And it's a rarity these days when a historical film is made that is directed mainly to children. It's even more rare when such a film is done well enough that adults can enjoy it, too. ""Felicity - An American Girl Adventure"" is one of those extremely rare movies that shows, fairly accurately, life in the colonial era of our country's history. Oh, I'll be the first to admit that there are 'liberties' taken in this film, as is normal with Hollywood-type movies. But when one compares the liberties taken here to a historical film with more of an adult nature (""The Scarlet Letter"" comes to mind) I would say Felicity is much closer to historical accuracy.The purpose of this film, however, is not necessarily to be a history lesson, but instead an entertaining story set during colonial times. Entertainment that tweens and parents should both enjoy and yet still understand the history behind it.The best part is - - - there IS history to be learned here.I enjoyed the inter-action of the main characters, especially with the grandfather, as it shows our ancestors not as stiff wood-cut sketches from history books but real people that actually existed at one time just like we exist today. In the course of watching this film we see fear, concern, anger, frustration...and happiness. This movie includes some of the discourse between family members concerning the outset of what would become the American Revolution, which, for whom this movie is geared towards, was really taking a gamble. But, I feel it paid off. This alone is reason to award this film five stars, as school children in today's day and age do not always get both sides of the story. Even I, who went to school in the 60's and 70's, was taught that the people who lived in the colonies - virtually ALL of the people - were against the King of England. It wasn't until I took it upon myself many years later to study that era that I found out that many, many folks were loyalists and took arms against family members and neighbors. ""Felicity,"" for the first time that I can see in a movie geared toward children, shows that other side of our history.And, okay, I'll admit that seeing a ten year old girl sneaking out in the middle of the night to ride another person's horse might be taking it beyond reality of the time, but the director and producer and script writers are following the story line from the popular books. We know that little girls disobeying their parents without retribution would not have taken place during that time (although I'm sure most of today's youngsters will not follow Felicity's lead in this). And it does make for a good story that young folks can follow without the ""fast-action-gotta-keep-'em-interested"" style that's so popular to today's youth. But, the adult viewer must be aware that this movie is tailored toward the younger set and, thus, may not get into the deep details - or may gloss over - certain facts for story's sake. It does, however, allow for a story that can draw the kids, as well as their parents, in.As a Civil War re-enactor, I tend to look for farbiness (inaccuracies) in all period movies (not just Civil War era flicks) and I must say there was very little that I could see in ""Felicity."" Oh, a few minor things in this movie are inaccurate - ""Hello"" was not a greeting at that time as we know it to be today, and Christmas was slightly over-done for the colonial period - but, all in all, the over-all viewing seemed to be a window into the past.But, that's okay. I feel films like this (as well as the Felicity books) may just entice kids to learn more about Felicity's time period on their own, and that would be a good thing, don't you think?",5,A Well Done Period Movie for the family,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,3781,"['Getting', 'children', 'interested', 'history', 'tough', 'thing', 'do', 'especially', 'colonial', 'American', 'history', 'rarity', 'days', 'when', 'historical', 'film', 'made', 'directed', 'mainly', 'children', 'even', 'more', 'rare', 'when', 'film', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'too', 'Felicity', 'American', 'Girl', 'Adventure', 'one', 'extremely', 'rare', 'movies', 'fairly', 'accurately', 'life', 'colonial', 'era', 'country', 'history', 'Oh', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'are', ""'liberties"", 'taken', 'film', 'normal', 'Hollywood-type', 'movies', 'when', 'one', 'liberties', 'taken', 'here', 'historical', 'film', 'more', 'adult', 'nature', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'mind', 'would', 'say', 'Felicity', 'much', 'closer', 'historical', 'accuracy.The', 'purpose', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'history', 'lesson', 'instead', 'entertaining', 'story', 'set', 'colonial', 'times', 'Entertainment', 'tweens', 'parents', 'should', 'enjoy', 'yet', 'still', 'understand', 'history', 'it.The', 'best', 'part', 'history', 'be', 'learned', 'here.I', 'enjoyed', 'inter-action', 'main', 'characters', 'especially', 'grandfather', 'ancestors', 'not', 'stiff', 'wood-cut', 'sketches', 'history', 'books', 'real', 'people', 'actually', 'existed', 'one', 'time', 'just', 'exist', 'today', 'course', 'watching', 'film', 'see', 'fear', 'concern', 'anger', 'frustration', 'happiness', 'movie', 'discourse', 'family', 'members', 'concerning', 'outset', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'American', 'Revolution', 'whom', 'movie', 'geared', 'towards', 'was', 'really', 'taking', 'gamble', 'feel', 'paid', 'off', 'alone', 'reason', 'award', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'school', 'children', 'today', 'day', 'age', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'get', 'sides', 'story', 'Even', 'who', 'went', 'school', '60', '70', 'was', 'taught', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'colonies', 'virtually', 'people', 'were', 'King', 'England', 'was', ""n't"", 'took', 'upon', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'study', 'era', 'found', 'out', 'many', 'many', 'folks', 'were', 'loyalists', 'took', 'arms', 'family', 'members', 'neighbors', 'Felicity', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'geared', 'children', 'shows', 'other', 'side', 'history.And', 'okay', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'seeing', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'sneaking', 'out', 'middle', 'night', 'ride', 'person', 'horse', 'might', 'be', 'taking', 'reality', 'time', 'director', 'producer', 'script', 'writers', 'are', 'following', 'story', 'line', 'popular', 'books', 'know', 'little', 'girls', 'disobeying', 'parents', 'retribution', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'today', 'youngsters', 'will', 'not', 'follow', 'Felicity', 'lead', 'make', 'good', 'story', 'young', 'folks', 'can', 'follow', 'fast-action-', 'got', 'ta', ""-keep-'em-interested"", 'style', 'so', 'popular', 'today', 'youth', 'adult', 'viewer', 'must', 'be', 'aware', 'movie', 'tailored', 'younger', 'set', 'thus', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'deep', 'details', 'may', 'gloss', 'certain', 'facts', 'story', 'sake', 'however', 'allow', 'story', 'can', 'draw', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'parents', 'in.As', 'Civil', 'War', 're-enactor', 'tend', 'look', 'farbiness', 'inaccuracies', 'period', 'movies', 'not', 'just', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'flicks', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'could', 'see', 'Felicity', 'Oh', 'few', 'minor', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'Hello', 'was', 'not', 'greeting', 'time', 'know', 'be', 'today', 'Christmas', 'was', 'slightly', 'over-done', 'colonial', 'period', 'over-all', 'viewing', 'seemed', 'be', 'window', 'past.But', 'okay', 'feel', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'Felicity', 'books', 'may', 'just', 'entice', 'kids', 'learn', 'more', 'Felicity', 'time', 'period', 'own', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think']",Felicity - An American Girl Adventure

The American revoultion fascinates me, so I am inclined to have a look at anything that comes out on the subject.If you're looking for a film to show children about the American revolution, I am sorry to say that this just is not it.Felicity is a nine year old tom boy growing up in Colonial Williamsberg. (In one scene outof curiosity she runs around in a barrowed set of breaches). She is a wonderful human being. She helps a  horse escape from a cruel owner. She later helps the owner when he ends up in Williamsberg jail.It is actually shot on sight. Great scenery.It shows her getting a upper class girl's education for the time.Her father is a shoppkeeper. Her Grandfather is a plantation owner. (Despite all the Black people, they don't mention a word of Slavery). Storm clouds of the American Revolutio are brewing.She befriends a girl who's family is Loyalist. (Her grandfather is also Loyalist). But they're rather flat on explaining why they're loyalist. Other than the King is the King they seem to be Two dimensional about their beliefs.Her friend, her father's apprentice, is a Patriot and he is even worse. He makes many mistakes. First of which being that most Patriots were not talking independence. Second being they never expressed grievences against the King back then. They made their complaints strictly against Parliment, Hoping the King would be a man of common sence which he was not. Taxation without representation actually meant something. After the French and Indian war many Americans like Benjamin Franklin were actually thinking of Americans being directly represented at Parliment with their own members. Parliment Rejected that and then began laying taxes directly on the Americans along with economic restrictions. These were not good for Americans who were in the process of rebuilding their own economy from the war.Not to mention the fact that at the time the American colonies were a cash poor barter economy which was made worse by Parliment  mindlessly putting restrictions on which was causing them a lot of problems.  As a Patriot his portrayal is pathetic.In addition, which was also not mentioned, many were actually becoming paranoid that they were being set up for some major take over. This was the same time Parliment had enacted the Encloser Acts in Britain. Many of the displaced immigrated to the colonies rather than take their chances in the big city slums.The film does not reflect these. It really is very Two Dimensional.The most historicly true character is her mother, frequently pregnant. (The average Amercan woman of the time had between eight and ten children). During the course of the film she gives birth to a child and suffers complications from the pregnancy but manages to get through though causing a lot of anxiety in the family. This is very accurate.Overall, this isn't a good film for helping understand the period.",3,beutiful scenery but Flat plot,1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,2930,"['Saw', 'television', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'American', 'revoultion', 'fascinates', 'so', 'am', 'inclined', 'have', 'look', 'anything', 'out', 'subject.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'show', 'children', 'American', 'revolution', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'just', 'not', 'it.Felicity', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'tom', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'Colonial', 'Williamsberg', 'one', 'scene', 'outof', 'curiosity', 'around', 'barrowed', 'set', 'breaches', 'wonderful', 'human', 'being', 'horse', 'escape', 'cruel', 'owner', 'later', 'owner', 'when', 'up', 'Williamsberg', 'jail.It', 'actually', 'shot', 'sight', 'Great', 'scenery.It', 'getting', 'upper', 'class', 'girl', 'education', 'time.Her', 'father', 'shoppkeeper', 'Grandfather', 'plantation', 'owner', 'Black', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'word', 'Slavery', 'Storm', 'clouds', 'American', 'Revolutio', 'are', 'brewing.She', 'girl', 'who', 'family', 'Loyalist', 'grandfather', 'also', 'Loyalist', ""'re"", 'rather', 'flat', 'explaining', 'why', ""'re"", 'loyalist', 'Other', 'King', 'King', 'seem', 'be', 'Two', 'dimensional', 'beliefs.Her', 'friend', 'father', 'apprentice', 'Patriot', 'even', 'worse', 'many', 'mistakes', 'First', 'being', 'most', 'Patriots', 'were', 'not', 'talking', 'independence', 'Second', 'being', 'never', 'expressed', 'grievences', 'King', 'back', 'then', 'made', 'complaints', 'strictly', 'Parliment', 'Hoping', 'King', 'would', 'be', 'man', 'common', 'sence', 'was', 'not', 'Taxation', 'representation', 'actually', 'meant', 'something', 'French', 'Indian', 'war', 'many', 'Americans', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'were', 'actually', 'thinking', 'Americans', 'being', 'directly', 'represented', 'Parliment', 'own', 'members', 'Parliment', 'Rejected', 'then', 'began', 'laying', 'taxes', 'directly', 'Americans', 'economic', 'restrictions', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'process', 'rebuilding', 'own', 'economy', 'war.Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'time', 'American', 'colonies', 'were', 'cash', 'poor', 'barter', 'economy', 'was', 'made', 'worse', 'Parliment', 'mindlessly', 'putting', 'restrictions', 'was', 'causing', 'lot', 'problems', 'Patriot', 'portrayal', 'pathetic.In', 'addition', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'mentioned', 'many', 'were', 'actually', 'becoming', 'paranoid', 'were', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'major', 'take', 'was', 'same', 'time', 'Parliment', 'had', 'enacted', 'Encloser', 'Acts', 'Britain', 'Many', 'displaced', 'immigrated', 'colonies', 'rather', 'take', 'chances', 'big', 'city', 'slums.The', 'film', 'not', 'reflect', 'really', 'very', 'Two', 'Dimensional.The', 'most', 'historicly', 'true', 'character', 'mother', 'frequently', 'pregnant', 'average', 'Amercan', 'woman', 'time', 'had', 'eight', 'ten', 'children', 'course', 'film', 'birth', 'child', 'suffers', 'complications', 'pregnancy', 'get', 'causing', 'lot', 'anxiety', 'family', 'very', 'accurate.Overall', ""n't"", 'good', 'film', 'helping', 'understand', 'period']",Felicity - An American Girl Adventure

In the story, Felicity *repeatedly* disobeys her parents' clear instructions in order to visit an almost-wild horse (belonging to the ""villian"" of the story) and to tame and train the horse secretly, by night.  It takes many night sessions in order for her to do this.In the context of the story this is very dangerous behavior because not only was the horse wild (having been previously demonstrated to be dangerous), but the man to whom it belongs was also, at that time, mean, drunken looking, and obviously threatening had he found Felicity on his property at night.  And, of course it was deliberate disobedience against her parents for her to be doing it anyway.Now, during Felicity's repeated disobedient and dangerous visits I kept thinking that, in Disney-like fashion (that is, the *older* classic Disney films), there would probably be some consequences to her repeated and deliberate disobedience, and therefore a good lesson learned.  I thought that the huge horse, with it's wildly rearing hooves, would certainly hurt the child, necessatating the ugly intervention of the property owner, and thus teaching the girl (and the viewers) a moral lesson about the serious consequences of deliberate parental disobedience.Was I right?Nope.In the story, the child successfully ""trains"" the horse by repeated disobedient and secretive nighttime visits, and, in the end, the adults basically overlook it, and in effect give their consent and approbation to everything the girl did.  (Her triumphant ride through the meadow after taming the horse, with theme music swelling up under the beautiful scenery effectively makes the girl's actions of disobedience out to be heroic). On top of that, the girl even gets the horse in the end (for which she's been dreaming the whole film, and which motivated her disobedience throughout).There's no doubt that this is a well produced and visually beautiful film with a lot of good things about it --- and therein lies the danger.Many parents will think this is wholesome family oriented entertainment and won't stop to consider the overriding LESSON being taught their children by the central crisis/desire of the main character (with whom the children are most strongly identifying!).(As an aside, I must also mention that a previous reviewer's comments about the cleavage in the ladies costumes is also something which I noticed as being extreme and out of period.  If a real character of the time had worn the sort of buxom-displaying attire that Marcia Gay Harden's character (the mother!!) wears in this film, she would certainly have been considered a ""lady of the street"".  I also noted that, in that day, no child would have been allowed to even enter a prison, much less visit a prisioner as happens in the film.  Prisons in those days were dark almost dungeonlike places and there's no way a father would have taken his daughter into one.)However, these historical inaccuracies are minor points compared to the overriding moral lesson of the film which is this: IT'S OKAY TO DISOBEY YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR FONDEST DREAMS WILL COME TRUE IF YOU DO.Bottom line:  beautiful film, bad lesson.  It is a real shame.One wonders what sort of parents the producers and writers are themselves that they did not spot this gaping moral flaw in the script before production.  But, then, sadly, some parents just don't care these days, do they?If you are not familiar with the Disney film classics of the '40s through '70s, do yourself a favor and investiate them instead.  There are many historical films there which, while the history may not always be exactly accurate, at least do not overtly teach  accompanying lessons which work AGAINST the very lessons which family-oriented parents are trying to teach their children in the first place.",2,WARNING TO PARENTS! --- Bad Lesson in Beguiling Film,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,3980,"['certainly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'evocation', 'period', 'lot', 'good', 'it.However', 'central', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'point', 'very', 'dangerous', 'lesson', 'children', 'story', 'Felicity', '*repeatedly*', 'parents', 'clear', 'instructions', 'order', 'visit', 'almost-wild', 'horse', 'belonging', 'villian', 'story', 'tame', 'train', 'horse', 'secretly', 'night', 'many', 'night', 'sessions', 'order', 'do', 'this.In', 'context', 'story', 'very', 'dangerous', 'behavior', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'horse', 'wild', 'having', 'been', 'previously', 'demonstrated', 'be', 'dangerous', 'man', 'whom', 'was', 'also', 'time', 'mean', 'drunken', 'looking', 'obviously', 'threatening', 'had', 'found', 'Felicity', 'property', 'night', 'course', 'was', 'deliberate', 'disobedience', 'parents', 'be', 'doing', 'anyway.Now', 'Felicity', 'repeated', 'disobedient', 'dangerous', 'visits', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Disney-like', 'fashion', '*older*', 'classic', 'Disney', 'films', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'consequences', 'repeated', 'deliberate', 'disobedience', 'therefore', 'good', 'lesson', 'learned', 'thought', 'huge', 'horse', 'wildly', 'rearing', 'hooves', 'would', 'certainly', 'hurt', 'child', 'necessatating', 'ugly', 'intervention', 'property', 'owner', 'thus', 'teaching', 'girl', 'viewers', 'moral', 'lesson', 'serious', 'consequences', 'deliberate', 'parental', 'disobedience.Was', 'right', 'Nope.In', 'story', 'child', 'successfully', 'trains', 'horse', 'repeated', 'disobedient', 'secretive', 'nighttime', 'visits', 'end', 'adults', 'basically', 'overlook', 'effect', 'give', 'consent', 'approbation', 'everything', 'girl', 'did', 'triumphant', 'ride', 'meadow', 'taming', 'horse', 'theme', 'music', 'swelling', 'up', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'effectively', 'girl', 'actions', 'disobedience', 'be', 'heroic', 'top', 'girl', 'even', 'horse', 'end', 'been', 'dreaming', 'whole', 'film', 'motivated', 'disobedience', 'doubt', 'well', 'produced', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'film', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'therein', 'danger.Many', 'parents', 'will', 'think', 'wholesome', 'family', 'oriented', 'entertainment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'consider', 'overriding', 'LESSON', 'being', 'taught', 'children', 'central', 'crisis/desire', 'main', 'character', 'whom', 'children', 'are', 'most', 'strongly', 'identifying', 'aside', 'must', 'also', 'mention', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'comments', 'cleavage', 'ladies', 'costumes', 'also', 'something', 'noticed', 'being', 'extreme', 'period', 'real', 'character', 'time', 'had', 'worn', 'sort', 'buxom-displaying', 'attire', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'character', 'mother', 'film', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'lady', 'street', 'also', 'noted', 'day', 'child', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'even', 'enter', 'prison', 'much', 'less', 'prisioner', 'happens', 'film', 'Prisons', 'days', 'were', 'dark', 'almost', 'dungeonlike', 'places', 'way', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'daughter', 'one', 'However', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'are', 'minor', 'points', 'compared', 'overriding', 'moral', 'lesson', 'film', 'IT', 'OKAY', 'TO', 'DISOBEY', 'YOUR', 'PARENTS', 'YOUR', 'FONDEST', 'DREAMS', 'WILL', 'COME', 'TRUE', 'IF', 'YOU', 'DO.Bottom', 'line', 'beautiful', 'film', 'bad', 'lesson', 'real', 'shame.One', 'wonders', 'what', 'sort', 'parents', 'producers', 'writers', 'are', 'did', 'not', 'spot', 'gaping', 'moral', 'flaw', 'script', 'production', 'then', 'sadly', 'parents', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'days', 'do', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Disney', 'film', 'classics', ""'40s"", ""'70s"", 'do', 'favor', 'investiate', 'instead', 'are', 'many', 'historical', 'films', 'history', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'exactly', 'accurate', 'least', 'do', 'not', 'overtly', 'teach', 'accompanying', 'lessons', 'work', 'very', 'lessons', 'family-oriented', 'parents', 'are', 'trying', 'teach', 'children', 'first', 'place']",Felicity - An American Girl Adventure

This one is set in Williamsburg, Virginia, during the American Revolution, and the title character displays a tenacious heroism in her quest to do what is right, despite the threat of imminent danger. Felicity Merriman is beautifully played by Shailene Woodley. She is just perfect for the role, with an energetic screen presence, illuminated by a sweet smile that will steal your heart. Felicity's love for an abused horse teaches her, indirectly, how kindness to others can have a ""ripple effect"" for goodness and justice, no matter that the colonial world has erupted into rebellion. The direction is fluent but not overdone, cinematography is attractive, and acting is uniformly strong throughout the cast. In the interest of full disclosure, I should add that some of the period dialogue does not exactly roll off the lips in convincing fashion, and the special effect of snowfall looks awfully phony, but otherwise I bought this delightful production with no problem at all.

Yes, they got rid of the `transition' scenes from last year's 'Samantha' to allocate more story time, but 'Felicity' screen play writers obviously had not read the stories which this movie was supposedly based on.Ben Davidson (Kevin Zegers) is supposed to have his hair tied up in a queue.  He is, after all, in training to become a respectable shopkeeper, like Mr. Merriman (John Schneider). Yet, Ben looks more like the alt-rockers I listen to today than either a colonial-era apprentice or an aspiring member of General Washington's army.  Even a revolutionary apprentice would have his hair in the professional style of that time.Felicity (Shailene Woodley) is not supposed to visit her grandfather's plantation in the winter; she is supposed to be there in the springtime; an entire book is literally built around the idea. Plus, she is supposed to help out her father's store when he is called away. She, Ben, and Isaac are supposed to uncover the King's men stealing gunpowder in another one of her high spirited adventures, but it was completely omitted from the movie for whatever reason.Finally, Miss Manderly (Janine Theriault) was way too young in the movie. According to the book, she already has grey hair.  Instead, she gave the impression of somebody only being in her thirties.  Felicity never looses a tooth in her tea cup or anywhere in this movie.The actors do a good job with the material they had to work with, but the writers really needed to have understood what they were adapting a screenplay from. The little details of a story make all of the difference.Having Felicity an independent and impatient horse lover-rescuer with empathetic friends, parents, and a grandfather wasn't enough of a distinguishing plot when the books themselves said that she did so much more. The Felicity in the movie certainly had spunk at the beginning, but apparently lost it by the end to become `ladylike'.People who aren't interested in accurately bringing a story to life should not write screenplays for it.",3,`Felicity' isn't so revolutionary,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,2157,"['second', 'holiday', 'movie', 'American', 'Girls', 'series', 'tried', 'really', 'hard', 'failed', 'jump', 'several', 'self-constructed', 'hurdles', 'Yes', 'got', 'rid', 'transition', 'scenes', 'last', 'year', ""'Samantha"", 'allocate', 'more', 'story', 'time', ""'Felicity"", 'screen', 'play', 'writers', 'obviously', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'stories', 'movie', 'was', 'supposedly', 'based', 'on.Ben', 'Davidson', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'supposed', 'have', 'hair', 'tied', 'up', 'queue', 'training', 'become', 'respectable', 'shopkeeper', 'Mr.', 'Merriman', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Ben', 'more', 'alt-rockers', 'listen', 'today', 'colonial-era', 'apprentice', 'aspiring', 'member', 'General', 'Washington', 'army', 'Even', 'revolutionary', 'apprentice', 'would', 'have', 'hair', 'professional', 'style', 'time.Felicity', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'not', 'supposed', 'visit', 'grandfather', 'plantation', 'winter', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'springtime', 'entire', 'book', 'literally', 'built', 'idea', 'supposed', 'help', 'out', 'father', 'store', 'when', 'called', 'away', 'Ben', 'Isaac', 'are', 'supposed', 'uncover', 'King', 'men', 'stealing', 'gunpowder', 'one', 'high', 'spirited', 'adventures', 'was', 'completely', 'omitted', 'movie', 'reason.Finally', 'Miss', 'Manderly', 'Janine', 'Theriault', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'movie', 'According', 'book', 'already', 'grey', 'hair', 'Instead', 'gave', 'impression', 'somebody', 'only', 'being', 'thirties', 'Felicity', 'never', 'tooth', 'tea', 'cup', 'anywhere', 'movie.The', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'material', 'had', 'work', 'writers', 'really', 'needed', 'have', 'understood', 'what', 'were', 'adapting', 'screenplay', 'little', 'details', 'story', 'make', 'difference.Having', 'Felicity', 'independent', 'impatient', 'horse', 'lover-rescuer', 'empathetic', 'friends', 'parents', 'grandfather', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'distinguishing', 'plot', 'when', 'books', 'said', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Felicity', 'movie', 'certainly', 'had', 'spunk', 'beginning', 'apparently', 'lost', 'end', 'become', ""ladylike'.People"", 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'accurately', 'bringing', 'story', 'life', 'should', 'not', 'write', 'screenplays']",Felicity - An American Girl Adventure
