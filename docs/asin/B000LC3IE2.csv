1037924,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000LC3IE2,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 1]","I absolutely loved the first film despite the response some idiot people gave it because they have no patience or taste for anything good. I was a little nervous going into the sequel, because the first film set a pretty high bar for me (Not to mention I have very low standards for sequels because numerous film sequels ended up on my worst films list). But, Open Water 2: Adrift is still a fantastic film that, while not as good as the first film, still accomplishes a lot in what it sets out to do. Like the first film, you will be kept on edge and you will never know what will happen because this film will grip you until the very end.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Six friends (And a baby) go out on a yacht off the coast of Mexico and they're having a good time partying and celebrating a birthday. Then the six people decide to cool off and decide to go for a swim in the ocean (Well, five of them want to swim. One lady has a deathly fear of water from childhood experiences which the film explores). But once the friends are in the water, they make the unfortunate discovery that no one put down the ladder... and that the baby is still on board. Now the friends can't get back up and they're left in freezing water. Fatigue starts to set in, the friends argue and turn on each other, and hypothermia. Unlike the couple in the first film, the group doesn't have sharks to fear about... but each other.MUSIC: This music was much better than the first film's and did a better job of setting the mood. It was well-done and was well-composed throughout.ACTING: This is the area that the first film does better, which makes it superior to its sequel. While the actors are convincing for most of the film, there were times in which they slipped up thanks to moments of somewhat corny dialogue. However, these moments are very short, and don't last long. I really liked the actors and thought they performed their roles well (But they were not quite as convincing as Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis who were the actors in the first film).ACTION: This film, like the first one, is focused mostly on dialogue. But this sequel is far more violent than its predecessor. However, if you hated the first film because you thought it was boring (And you were an idiot) you'll hate this sequel as well. However, this film does a very good job at providing a tense atmosphere and makes you fear what will happen next and does manage to elicit some emotions as well because it feels real and it could happen.OVERALL: If you loved the first film, buy the sequel. If you hated the first film (Because you're an idiot), you'll hate this sequel. I loved every minute of this film and is easily one of the best films I've ever seen (Like its predecessor). It's a fantastic, creepy, and realistic film that will give you chills and shivers down your spine.THE GOOD: The realism, the acting, the music, and it's very tense and unpredictable.THE BAD: Somewhat of slow beginning and some moments of dialogue slip-ups.",5,"NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST, BUT STILL AMAZING  9.5 OUT OF 10",1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,2987,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'first', 'film', 'response', 'idiot', 'people', 'gave', 'have', 'patience', 'taste', 'anything', 'good', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'going', 'sequel', 'first', 'film', 'set', 'pretty', 'high', 'bar', 'Not', 'mention', 'have', 'very', 'low', 'standards', 'sequels', 'because', 'numerous', 'film', 'sequels', 'ended', 'up', 'worst', 'films', 'list', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'Adrift', 'still', 'fantastic', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'film', 'still', 'lot', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'first', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'kept', 'edge', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'film', 'will', 'grip', 'very', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Six', 'friends', 'baby', 'go', 'out', 'yacht', 'coast', 'Mexico', ""'re"", 'having', 'good', 'time', 'partying', 'celebrating', 'birthday', 'Then', 'six', 'people', 'decide', 'cool', 'off', 'decide', 'go', 'swim', 'ocean', 'Well', 'five', 'want', 'swim', 'One', 'lady', 'deathly', 'fear', 'water', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'film', 'explores', 'once', 'friends', 'are', 'water', 'make', 'unfortunate', 'discovery', 'one', 'put', 'down', 'ladder', 'baby', 'still', 'board', 'Now', 'friends', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'back', 'up', ""'re"", 'left', 'freezing', 'water', 'Fatigue', 'set', 'friends', 'argue', 'turn', 'other', 'hypothermia', 'couple', 'first', 'film', 'group', ""n't"", 'have', 'sharks', 'fear', 'other.MUSIC', 'music', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'setting', 'mood', 'was', 'well-done', 'was', 'well-composed', 'throughout.ACTING', 'area', 'first', 'film', 'better', 'superior', 'sequel', 'actors', 'are', 'convincing', 'most', 'film', 'were', 'times', 'slipped', 'up', 'thanks', 'moments', 'somewhat', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'However', 'moments', 'are', 'very', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'really', 'liked', 'actors', 'thought', 'performed', 'roles', 'well', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'convincing', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'Daniel', 'Travis', 'who', 'were', 'actors', 'first', 'film', '.ACTION', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'focused', 'mostly', 'dialogue', 'sequel', 'far', 'more', 'violent', 'predecessor', 'However', 'hated', 'first', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'boring', 'were', 'idiot', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'sequel', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'providing', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'manage', 'elicit', 'emotions', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'could', 'happen.OVERALL', 'loved', 'first', 'film', 'buy', 'sequel', 'hated', 'first', 'film', ""'re"", 'idiot', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'sequel', 'loved', 'minute', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'predecessor', 'fantastic', 'creepy', 'realistic', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'chills', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine.THE', 'GOOD', 'realism', 'acting', 'music', 'very', 'tense', 'unpredictable.THE', 'BAD', 'Somewhat', 'slow', 'beginning', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'slip-ups']",Open Water 2: Adrift
1037925,A73C1BKSAZPA,B000LC3IE2,Adam Richter,"[3, 3]","The first thing that must be emphasized about ""Open Water 2: Adrift"" is that it is NOT a sequel to ""Open Water."" It does not share any of the creators, actors, or characters from that earlier film. The reason this movie is  linked to ""Open Water"" is that it shares a similar situation: people have been accidentally stranded at sea and must survive the elements while  desperately hoping to be saved. Thus, you do not need to have seen the original ""Open Water"" to understand this film.Another point which needs to be made is that ""Open Water 2"" does NOT feature sharks, which were a big part of the original ""Open Water"" plot. The main common link that the films share is that both are low-budget horror movies which emphasize primal, psychological terror at sea instead of action and special effects. If the viewer is cool with that, he or she is likely to find ""Open Water 2"" entertaining.""Open Water 2"" features a cast of several people (the biggest ""name"" actor currently being Eric Dane of ""Grey's Anatomy"" fame) in peril, as opposed to just the two main characters stranded in ""Open Water."" This lends itself to a more ""traditional"" horror film setup, in which you expect multiple characters to get ""killed off"" over the course of the film as you wonder which ones (if any) will ultimately make it out alive. The film does a surprisingly good job of maintaining suspense throughout (although throwing some sharks into the mix would have helped jack up the fear factor even more.) The agonizing reality of the boat remaining JUST OUT OF REACH of the characters, as well as the fact that a baby is alone on the boat, adds a great deal of tension.The ending of the movie, as many others have commented, is where the film runs into trouble. While a few have praised it as ""ambiguous,"" the word ""frustrating"" is much more appropriate. I had to go back and watch it again, unsure of what had happened. It seems to me like two endings were shot for this film (a common practice), and the filmmakers were unsure about which one to go with, so they basically just used them both! I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll be intentionally vague: the ""first"" ending plays, and it seems like the credits should come up (the camera even pulls back, as you often see at the end of a film.) But suddenly there's an unexpected cut, and the ""second"" ending comes up, which appears to directly contradict what was just shown moments ago!In my opinion, it would been much more satisfying if the director had simply chosen one ending and stuck with it. The unused conclusion could have been included as a ""deleted scene"" or ""alternate ending"" among the dvd bonus materials. When you spend an hour and a half watching a movie to see who survives, do you really want to be saying ""huh?!"" at the end? Ambiguity may work well in more artistic films, but ""Open Water 2"" is a basic survival story and there's no reason why it shouldn't have a coherent, clear ending.However, if you can deal with a questionable ending, the rest of ""Open Water 2,"" while hardly a classic movie, is entertaining enough. If you liked the first ""Open Water,"" you'll probably want to check this one out too.",3,Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,3165,"['first', 'thing', 'must', 'be', 'emphasized', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'Adrift', 'NOT', 'sequel', 'Open', 'Water', 'not', 'share', 'creators', 'actors', 'characters', 'earlier', 'film', 'reason', 'movie', 'linked', 'Open', 'Water', 'shares', 'similar', 'situation', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'accidentally', 'stranded', 'sea', 'must', 'survive', 'elements', 'desperately', 'hoping', 'be', 'saved', 'Thus', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'Open', 'Water', 'understand', 'film.Another', 'point', 'be', 'made', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'NOT', 'feature', 'sharks', 'were', 'big', 'part', 'original', 'Open', 'Water', 'plot', 'main', 'common', 'link', 'films', 'share', 'are', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'movies', 'emphasize', 'primal', 'psychological', 'terror', 'sea', 'instead', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'viewer', 'cool', 'likely', 'find', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'entertaining', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'cast', 'several', 'people', 'biggest', 'name', 'actor', 'currently', 'being', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'fame', 'peril', 'opposed', 'just', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'stranded', 'Open', 'Water', 'more', 'traditional', 'horror', 'film', 'setup', 'expect', 'multiple', 'characters', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'course', 'film', 'wonder', 'ones', 'will', 'ultimately', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'job', 'maintaining', 'suspense', 'throwing', 'sharks', 'mix', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'jack', 'up', 'fear', 'factor', 'even', 'more', 'agonizing', 'reality', 'boat', 'remaining', 'JUST', 'OUT', 'OF', 'REACH', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'baby', 'alone', 'boat', 'great', 'deal', 'tension.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'where', 'film', 'trouble', 'few', 'have', 'praised', 'ambiguous', 'word', 'frustrating', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'unsure', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'two', 'endings', 'were', 'shot', 'film', 'common', 'practice', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'unsure', 'one', 'go', 'basically', 'just', 'used', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'be', 'intentionally', 'vague', 'first', 'ending', 'plays', 'credits', 'should', 'come', 'up', 'camera', 'even', 'back', 'often', 'see', 'end', 'film', 'suddenly', 'unexpected', 'cut', 'second', 'ending', 'up', 'directly', 'contradict', 'what', 'was', 'just', 'shown', 'moments', 'ago', 'opinion', 'would', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'director', 'had', 'simply', 'chosen', 'one', 'ending', 'stuck', 'unused', 'conclusion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'deleted', 'scene', 'alternate', 'ending', 'dvd', 'bonus', 'materials', 'When', 'spend', 'hour', 'half', 'watching', 'movie', 'see', 'who', 'do', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'saying', 'huh', 'end', 'Ambiguity', 'may', 'work', 'well', 'more', 'artistic', 'films', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'basic', 'survival', 'story', 'reason', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'coherent', 'clear', 'ending.However', 'can', 'deal', 'questionable', 'ending', 'rest', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'hardly', 'classic', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'liked', 'first', 'Open', 'Water', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'too']",Open Water 2: Adrift

The few things they could have done to save their lives they don't come anywhere near considering, while most of their other decisions are trumped by human stupidity. There's one brilliant moment where the film's main idiot realizes he's an idiot and confesses his idiocy and.... well, that's about it.The scenario is interesting: A bunch of friends partying on a yacht fail to lower a ladder - or even an anchor - over the side before they all jump in for a swim. Stuck out in the middle of nowhere they're forced to tread water until fatigue, injury, or idiocy draw them to certain doom. And oh yeah - someone left the baby on board alone.The movie balances on the brink of potential off and on, but just when you think it'll get good it turns to crap. Overall, what you hope will be a happy ending is just plain depressing. Why tell these stories? What's the point? There's no life lesson here. There's no survival skills taught or even learned.

This movie was supposedly based on a true story and I can believe it is.  If you were to write down everything that happens on paper in order it does make sense and could have made for quite a good movie but it just didn't fully succeed.It grabbed me in at the beginning with the 4 friends videotaping themselves.  I thought it really showed the closeness and bond between them all.  Then we go ahead 5 years and there is a reunion.  I didn't find the characters to be stereotypes but agree you found out little about them.  I thought the actors did very well with what they had.  I did believe the love and commitment between the married couple and found my concentration centering on them and their child.  I found their acting very believable and I felt for them.I think one reason this film does not work is because a viewer knows it takes place on the sea and danger happens.  One does expect scares but nothing much happens here.  When they first end up in the water with no way back onto the boat I think the film succesfully shows their growing terror and taps into all viewers fear of water and such a situation.  It had me for a little while.  But then the movie was just too long, very little happened and the suspense did not remain.  I believe if the film was better written it could have held the suspense throughout but it just lost steam.It grabbed me enough that I watched the whole thing and I certainly don't think it was terrible.

E Jackson,"[4, 5]","This is the sequel to Open Water and I must say, it's just as creepy and unsettling as the first.This is because much of the movie is silent and takes place in the water, as the young adults have no choice but to be stuck in the ocean and spend the whole time swimming around the boat (because they forgot to lower the ladder- oops, what a horrible unfortunate mistake).For the most part, the young adults gradually die off one by one, as they either sink, get frustrated and drowned, or hit their head on something and pass out.There's a lot of emotion in this film and concern whether the remaining young adults were going to survive the horrible ordeal, since the original Open Water had an incredibly shocking ending, you pretty much expected the same kind of conclusion here.  The ending in this movie isn't as good as the ending in the original, but pretty good nonetheless since it leaves you guessing.The fact that one of the young adults was terrified of the water because of something that happened in her past ended up playing a pretty important part of the storyline- in the beginning, she was constantly hesitating whether she wanted to get in the water or not.An interesting part of the story was how this same woman brought her baby daughter on board the ship, and while the young adults were struggling to get back inside the boat after forgetting to lower the ladder, the baby could be heard crying in the background.  I wondered at first whether the crying baby would be included as part of the storyline for added realism, and luckily it was.  Nice detail.The reason the young adults ended up in the water in the first place is because one of the guy friends grabbed his female friend and threw her in the water with the rest of the gang, and in the process didn't even think whether the ladder was lowered or not.  Dumb move.I'm surprised sharks didn't enter the picture, but they almost did at one point.

1037931,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000LC3IE2,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","When a group of friends get together for a day trip on their yacht in Mexico, they are stranded in the ocean after jumping in the water to go for a swim without dropping the ladder. With no way to get back on board and no help in sight, they each face panic, dehydration, and fatigue as they struggle to find a way to safety. Although it was originally intended as its own stand-alone feature, ADRIFT was quickly sold as a sequel to the 2003 hit OPEN WATER to cash in on the earlier film's success. Whether or not this helped or hurt its popularity is debatable. ADRIFT bases itself on the same terrifying, real-world scenarios that made OPEN WATER so unique, but this situation is made that much more ironic in that the characters' salvation lies just inches out of reach. The friends quickly turn on each other and begin to point the blame as soon as they realize how serious the situation is, until finally coming to their senses and making every logical attempt to save themselves. This is where ADRIFT succeeds over anything else in presenting intelligent and believable characters that just made a stupid (but deadly) mistake. Unfortunately, Hans Horn feels the need to throw in two unnecessary plot elements, one being the stereotypical backstory where one of the characters had a traumatic childhood experience with water, and the other being a baby that is left aboard the ship. These things aside, ADRIFT is a decent companion piece to OPEN WATER that compliments it thematically and offers good acting for the size and scale.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,Open Water 2,1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,1567,"['When', 'group', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'day', 'trip', 'yacht', 'Mexico', 'are', 'stranded', 'ocean', 'jumping', 'water', 'go', 'swim', 'dropping', 'ladder', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'board', 'help', 'sight', 'face', 'panic', 'dehydration', 'fatigue', 'struggle', 'find', 'way', 'safety', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'own', 'stand-alone', 'feature', 'ADRIFT', 'was', 'quickly', 'sold', 'sequel', '2003', 'hit', 'OPEN', 'WATER', 'cash', 'earlier', 'film', 'success', 'not', 'helped', 'hurt', 'popularity', 'debatable', 'ADRIFT', 'same', 'terrifying', 'real-world', 'scenarios', 'made', 'OPEN', 'WATER', 'so', 'unique', 'situation', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'ironic', 'characters', 'salvation', 'just', 'inches', 'reach', 'friends', 'quickly', 'turn', 'other', 'begin', 'point', 'blame', 'as', 'soon', 'realize', 'how', 'serious', 'situation', 'finally', 'coming', 'senses', 'making', 'logical', 'attempt', 'save', 'where', 'ADRIFT', 'over', 'anything', 'else', 'presenting', 'intelligent', 'believable', 'characters', 'just', 'made', 'stupid', 'deadly', 'mistake', 'Unfortunately', 'Hans', 'Horn', 'need', 'throw', 'two', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'elements', 'one', 'being', 'stereotypical', 'backstory', 'where', 'one', 'characters', 'had', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'experience', 'water', 'other', 'being', 'baby', 'left', 'ship', 'things', 'aside', 'ADRIFT', 'decent', 'companion', 'piece', 'OPEN', 'WATER', 'thematically', 'good', 'acting', 'size', 'scale.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Open Water 2: Adrift

1037934,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000LC3IE2,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[48, 52]","After reading the premise of this movie, I just had to see it.  Six friends jump off a yacht to take a swim in the ocean, only to realize that they are royally screwed because nobody thought to let the ladder down.  In other words, they've jumped in and they can't get up.  As one of the characters actually says, the circumstances would be funny if they weren't so serious.  Honestly, I expected this to be some kind of B-movie I could laugh at.  Instead, it's a polished production, and there's nothing funny about it.  You won't be traumatized by any means, but this is one deadly serious film that almost forces you to imagine yourself in the same situation.  For me, it was like having claustrophobia out in the middle of the ocean - a weird concept, of course, but that's how it made me feel.  I'm really surprised that the film gets so many lukewarm and negative reviews.  I found it intense, and I was delighted that things didn't play out the way I expected.  The director threw us a curveball at the end, with a pretty ambiguous ending, but after a little thought I can't even criticize that decision, as I believe it ties in with the real story that inspired the film.A group of old friends get together for a weekend on the high seas, and it looks like a good time will be had by all on board Dan's (Eric Dane) luxurious yacht.  (Of course, to really enjoy the cruise, you sort of need to be on the yacht most of the time - aye, that's the rub.) Three guys, three gals, and a baby whose mother has a major water phobia make up the passenger manifest.  Some viewers don't seem to like some of these characters, but we really don't get to know any of them intimately before the real drama begins.  They're basically just normal people, and that helps put you into the ""what would I do in their situation?"" mindset.Let's just look at some of the things we can learn from this movie.  1) If a childhood tragedy has given you a major water phobia, you might want to just pass on the private yacht vacation thing, especially if you have a baby to take care of.  2) Out of every six people, at least one of them is the kind of jerk who will try to cure a friend's fear of the water by picking her up and jumping into the ocean with her.  3) This one's really important - don't forget to let the ladder down before you and everyone else on board go for a swim in the ocean because you cannot get back up on the yacht without said ladder.  4) In this kind of dangerous situation, don't fight over the very sharp knife.  5) When ""nuding up"" to make a rope out of your clothes, let the lightest person - not the biggest guy - try to climb up the ""rope"" first.  6) When desperately trying to get back to the surface after a dive, watch your freakin' head.  7) When facing such a ""what a stupid way to die"" situation such as this, you learn a whole lot about your friends.Open Water 2: Adrift (which is its own film and not a true sequel to Open Water) turned out to be really intense.  Desperation comes quickly and only grows as the whole situation worsens.  A full 2/3 of this film takes place in the ocean itself.  I know you're probably expecting a shark attack to come along at some point - I know I was - but don't be disappointed by the complete absence of deadly oceanic predators in this film.  I think a shark attack would have actually hurt the story, as it would have taken something away from the intensely personal tragedy these poor people have to face.  With no outside threat to unite against, these characters quickly turn against one another, making their situation even direr in the process.  Then you have the sounds of the baby crying every now and again, adding even more to the angst the characters are feeling and emoting, especially the child's mother Amy (Susan May Pratt).  Some viewers are going to quibble and go into a ""they should have done this or that"" kind of mania as they watch the film, but I found it really quite realistic in terms of the situation.My first reaction to the film's ending was less than enthusiastic - it's one of those ""please don't end it like this --- aaaarrgghhh"" types of ending.  After reading one of the director's comments and taking a few moments to reflect on it, however, I find myself having no problem whatsoever with the ambiguity of that final minute.  Not surprisingly, I think this is a great, underrated movie; it certainly exceeded my somewhat low expectations by leaps and bounds.",5,A surprisingly intense and gripping film that more than exceeded my expectations,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,4455,"['reading', 'premise', 'movie', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'Six', 'jump', 'off', 'yacht', 'take', 'swim', 'ocean', 'only', 'realize', 'are', 'royally', 'screwed', 'nobody', 'thought', 'let', 'ladder', 'down', 'other', 'words', ""'ve"", 'jumped', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'one', 'characters', 'actually', 'circumstances', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'serious', 'Honestly', 'expected', 'be', 'kind', 'B-movie', 'could', 'laugh', 'Instead', 'polished', 'production', 'nothing', 'funny', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'traumatized', 'means', 'one', 'deadly', 'serious', 'film', 'almost', 'forces', 'imagine', 'same', 'situation', 'was', 'having', 'claustrophobia', 'out', 'middle', 'ocean', 'weird', 'concept', 'course', 'how', 'made', 'feel', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'lukewarm', 'negative', 'reviews', 'found', 'intense', 'was', 'delighted', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'out', 'way', 'expected', 'director', 'threw', 'curveball', 'end', 'pretty', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'little', 'thought', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'criticize', 'decision', 'believe', 'real', 'story', 'inspired', 'film.A', 'group', 'old', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'weekend', 'high', 'seas', 'good', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'had', 'board', 'Dan', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'luxurious', 'yacht', 'course', 'really', 'enjoy', 'cruise', 'sort', 'need', 'be', 'yacht', 'most', 'time', 'aye', 'rub', 'Three', 'guys', 'three', 'gals', 'baby', 'mother', 'major', 'water', 'phobia', 'make', 'up', 'passenger', 'manifest', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'like', 'characters', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'intimately', 'real', 'drama', ""'re"", 'basically', 'just', 'normal', 'people', 'put', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'mindset.Let', 'just', 'look', 'things', 'can', 'learn', 'movie', '1', 'childhood', 'tragedy', 'given', 'major', 'water', 'phobia', 'might', 'want', 'just', 'pass', 'private', 'yacht', 'vacation', 'thing', 'especially', 'have', 'baby', 'take', 'care', '2', 'six', 'people', 'least', 'one', 'kind', 'jerk', 'who', 'will', 'try', 'cure', 'friend', 'fear', 'water', 'picking', 'up', 'jumping', 'ocean', '3', 'one', 'really', 'important', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'let', 'ladder', 'down', 'everyone', 'else', 'board', 'go', 'swim', 'ocean', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'yacht', 'said', 'ladder', '4', 'kind', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'do', ""n't"", 'fight', 'very', 'sharp', 'knife', '5', 'When', 'nuding', 'up', 'make', 'rope', 'clothes', 'let', 'lightest', 'person', 'not', 'biggest', 'guy', 'try', 'climb', 'up', 'rope', 'first', '6', 'When', 'desperately', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'surface', 'dive', 'watch', 'freakin', 'head', '7', 'When', 'facing', 'what', 'stupid', 'way', 'die', 'situation', 'such', 'learn', 'whole', 'lot', 'friends.Open', 'Water', '2', 'Adrift', 'own', 'film', 'not', 'true', 'sequel', 'Open', 'Water', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'really', 'intense', 'Desperation', 'quickly', 'only', 'whole', 'situation', 'worsens', 'full', '2/3', 'film', 'place', 'ocean', 'know', ""'re"", 'probably', 'expecting', 'shark', 'attack', 'come', 'along', 'point', 'know', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'complete', 'absence', 'deadly', 'oceanic', 'predators', 'film', 'think', 'shark', 'attack', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'hurt', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'something', 'away', 'intensely', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'poor', 'people', 'have', 'face', 'outside', 'threat', 'unite', 'characters', 'quickly', 'turn', 'one', 'making', 'situation', 'even', 'direr', 'process', 'Then', 'have', 'sounds', 'baby', 'crying', 'now', 'again', 'adding', 'even', 'more', 'angst', 'characters', 'are', 'feeling', 'emoting', 'especially', 'child', 'mother', 'Amy', 'Susan', 'May', 'Pratt', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'quibble', 'go', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'kind', 'mania', 'watch', 'film', 'found', 'really', 'quite', 'realistic', 'terms', 'situation.My', 'first', 'reaction', 'film', 'ending', 'was', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'one', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'aaaarrgghhh', 'types', 'ending', 'reading', 'one', 'director', 'comments', 'taking', 'few', 'moments', 'reflect', 'however', 'find', 'having', 'problem', 'whatsoever', 'ambiguity', 'final', 'minute', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'think', 'great', 'underrated', 'movie', 'certainly', 'exceeded', 'somewhat', 'low', 'expectations', 'leaps', 'bounds']",Open Water 2: Adrift

1037937,A2MEPR41IMURZA,B000LC3IE2,Eric Hutchins,"[4, 5]","Others have covered this film well so I will simply add this: I surfed into this film on Dish and, as the former skipper of a 54' sailboat similar to the one shown, the synopsis immediately drew my attention.This and similar situations happen all too frequently. As others have said, I was on the edge of my seat much of the last two thirds of the movie. Like the actors in this film, most guests aboard a small vessel do not realize they are putting their lives in the hands of the boat's skipper. My recommendation is to take a good look at the skipper before getting aboard and ask yourself if this is the kind of person you want to hang your life on. The sea, mountain peaks, and the like can be VERY unforgiving which is a way of saying that you can get 99 things in a hundred right and still die because something obvious is overlooked. This film should be mandatory viewing for anyone planning to hop aboard a friend's boat for a sunny day on the water. Nuf said on that...I found most of the plot set in the water credible. It's a big ocean and most of it contains no preditors. Also, if something was going to get done, it would have had to have happened in the first hour or two because of hypothermia and rapid loss of strength. Thus, the final solution for those that remained just was not believable. By the end of the film, everyone should have perished. Ironically, who ever found the boat would have been left with a Bermuda Triangle style mystery. My biggest concern from the beginning was that the wind would come up and start blowing the boat forcing the crew to swim to stay along side. A breeze did come up that was plenty to move a boat with that much freeboard... yet it stayed amazingly stationary without the benefit of anchor.The crew did start down the road to a solution almost immediately but the plot turned in a different direction in a credible way. Remember, it is hard to think straight when people are wet, cold, tired, having to keep their mouth above water continuously, and otherwise paniced. I am willing to bet good money that with a guy in the water on either side of the lightest woman, she could have gotten a foot into the palm of each guy's hand, then get a foot on each shoulder, and stretch for the toe rail or lifeline. Failing that, the men could get a palm under each of her feet and hoist her up to the toe rail, lifeline, etc. However, once the crew lost their strength they were goners. The moral of the story is pick your skipper well and speak up if you see ANYTHING that you think could turn into a problem... he needs all the eyes and ears the crew can bring to bear in any whether conditions.",4,Surprisingly believable and well-acted...,1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2009,2650,"['Others', 'have', 'covered', 'film', 'well', 'so', 'will', 'simply', 'add', 'surfed', 'film', 'Dish', 'former', 'skipper', '54', 'sailboat', 'similar', 'one', 'shown', 'synopsis', 'immediately', 'drew', 'attention.This', 'similar', 'situations', 'happen', 'too', 'frequently', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'much', 'last', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'actors', 'film', 'most', 'guests', 'aboard', 'small', 'vessel', 'do', 'not', 'realize', 'are', 'putting', 'lives', 'hands', 'boat', 'skipper', 'recommendation', 'take', 'good', 'look', 'skipper', 'getting', 'aboard', 'ask', 'kind', 'person', 'want', 'hang', 'life', 'sea', 'mountain', 'peaks', 'like', 'can', 'be', 'VERY', 'unforgiving', 'way', 'saying', 'can', 'get', '99', 'things', 'hundred', 'right', 'still', 'die', 'something', 'obvious', 'overlooked', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'mandatory', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'planning', 'hop', 'friend', 'boat', 'sunny', 'day', 'water', 'Nuf', 'said', 'found', 'most', 'plot', 'set', 'water', 'credible', 'big', 'ocean', 'most', 'preditors', 'Also', 'something', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'have', 'happened', 'first', 'hour', 'two', 'hypothermia', 'rapid', 'loss', 'strength', 'Thus', 'final', 'solution', 'remained', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'end', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'have', 'perished', 'Ironically', 'who', 'ever', 'found', 'boat', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'style', 'mystery', 'biggest', 'concern', 'beginning', 'was', 'wind', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'start', 'blowing', 'boat', 'forcing', 'crew', 'swim', 'stay', 'side', 'breeze', 'did', 'come', 'up', 'was', 'plenty', 'move', 'boat', 'much', 'freeboard', 'yet', 'stayed', 'amazingly', 'stationary', 'benefit', 'anchor.The', 'crew', 'did', 'start', 'road', 'solution', 'almost', 'immediately', 'plot', 'turned', 'different', 'direction', 'credible', 'way', 'Remember', 'hard', 'think', 'straight', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'wet', 'cold', 'tired', 'having', 'keep', 'mouth', 'water', 'continuously', 'otherwise', 'paniced', 'am', 'willing', 'bet', 'good', 'money', 'guy', 'water', 'side', 'lightest', 'woman', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'foot', 'palm', 'guy', 'hand', 'then', 'get', 'foot', 'shoulder', 'stretch', 'toe', 'rail', 'lifeline', 'Failing', 'men', 'could', 'get', 'palm', 'feet', 'hoist', 'up', 'toe', 'rail', 'lifeline', 'etc', 'However', 'once', 'crew', 'lost', 'strength', 'were', 'goners', 'moral', 'story', 'pick', 'skipper', 'well', 'speak', 'up', 'see', 'think', 'could', 'turn', 'problem', 'eyes', 'crew', 'can', 'bring', 'bear', 'conditions']",Open Water 2: Adrift

A group of idiots go on a boat (whoopse sorry Yacht) jump overboard then realise that they forgot to lower the ladder first!This realy has got to be one of the worst plots ever thought of and all this 'based on a true story' or rather 'loosly on a true story'  Yeh just how loose?  The 6 drunk idiots on a boat?  Sorry but unless I have some actual proof I dont belive a word of it.Problems with this film are 1. The characters are basically just rich idiots so the viewer frankly doesnt realy care what happens to them.  (Good example of this is leaving the baby on board while they get drunk and go for a swim) 2. Instead of realistically thinking through how they can actually get back on board they just argue, have the odd fit of temper, swim off for a bit then come back and various other pointless acts which lets face it, if you realy where stuck in this situation you would channel all efforts into getting back on board not swiming in circles.  3. The so called 'confession' of the boat owner towards the end, no it doesnt make you relate to him or any of the others more just makes you think of him as more of a prat than before.  4. There is just no realism to any of it, open water had some suspence, you felt sorry for the 2 characters who were just decent people taking a holiday that went horribly wrong not a group of idiots deviod of brains or responsibility.And how the film ends.....you will be kicking yourself you ever put yourself through the hour and whatever of this rubbish.Realy cant say there is anything to recomend from this film.",1,Difficult to have anything positive to say.........,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,1687,"['know', 'film', 'bad', 'when', 'are', 'realy', 'lost', 'find', 'anything', 'positive', 'say', 'Not', 'actors', 'plot', 'nothing', 'group', 'idiots', 'go', 'boat', 'whoopse', 'sorry', 'Yacht', 'jump', 'overboard', 'then', 'realise', 'forgot', 'lower', 'ladder', 'first', 'realy', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'plots', 'ever', 'thought', ""'based"", 'true', 'story', 'rather', ""'loosly"", 'true', 'story', 'Yeh', 'just', 'how', 'loose', '6', 'drunk', 'idiots', 'boat', 'Sorry', 'have', 'actual', 'proof', 'dont', 'belive', 'word', 'it.Problems', 'film', 'are', '1', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'just', 'rich', 'idiots', 'viewer', 'frankly', 'realy', 'care', 'what', 'Good', 'example', 'leaving', 'baby', 'board', 'get', 'drunk', 'go', 'swim', '2', 'Instead', 'realistically', 'thinking', 'how', 'can', 'actually', 'get', 'back', 'board', 'just', 'argue', 'have', 'odd', 'fit', 'temper', 'swim', 'off', 'bit', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'various', 'other', 'pointless', 'acts', 'face', 'realy', 'where', 'stuck', 'situation', 'would', 'channel', 'efforts', 'getting', 'back', 'board', 'not', 'swiming', 'circles', '3', 'so', 'called', ""'confession"", 'boat', 'owner', 'end', 'doesnt', 'make', 'relate', 'others', 'more', 'just', 'think', 'more', 'prat', 'before', '4', 'just', 'realism', 'open', 'water', 'had', 'suspence', 'felt', 'sorry', '2', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'decent', 'people', 'taking', 'holiday', 'went', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'not', 'group', 'idiots', 'deviod', 'brains', 'responsibility.And', 'how', 'film', '..you', 'will', 'be', 'kicking', 'ever', 'put', 'hour', 'whatever', 'rubbish.Realy', 'cant', 'say', 'anything', 'recomend', 'film']",Open Water 2: Adrift
1037942,A3NV0G16V04FYM,B000LC3IE2,"Jack Baker ""Beauty Will Save the World""","[16, 20]","There be Spoliers Ahead, Yar!  Actually, it's pretty much a complete plot summary, so consider yourself warned.I caught this movie on the Independent Film Channel not that long ago.  A caveat: ordinarily, I pretty much stick to reviewing things that I like, simply because usually I don't care enough to waste my time on the things that I don't.  I'm going to have to make an exception for this movie.  The plot is pretty basic: a group of college friends get together on the luxury yacht belonging to one of the guys.  They decide to go for a swim in the ocean, leaving the owner of the boat aboard with one of the women and her baby.  The woman is hydrophobic, caused by a tragedy in her past, revealed through clumsy flashback sequences.  The guy who owns the boat grabs the hydrophobic woman and jumps off the side of the boat with her, which terrifies her and sends her into shock.So now all six adults are in the water and the baby is on the boat alone.  And none of these idiots were smart enough to lower the ladder on the boat, trapping them in the ocean as the sides of the boat are too high to climb.  Between them, they have one diving mask and one diving knife.  They try to make a rope from their swimsuits, which fails. The hydrophobic woman's husband takes the mask and swims underneath the boat, looking for a way to get back aboard.  UNDERNEATH the boat, as if there might be a magic door down there somewhere.  He, of course, bumps his head hard enough to concuss himself, because obviously there needed to be more melodrama.  And then, the other two guys get in a fight after the third guy tries to use the knife to punch holes in the side of the boat to create hand holds to pull himself up.  The boat owner freaks and they fight, which leads to the third guy being stabbed.As if that isn't enough, we learn that the boat doesn't even belong to Mr. jerky boat owner, but to his boss.  Turns out he's a miserable failure trying to impress his old college buddies.  Meanwhile, stabbed guy dies, boat ""owner's"" girlfriend gives up and drowns, and then hydrophobic lady's husband also succumbs to his concussion.  Stabbed guy's wife is a swimmer, so she sets off for shore, never to be heard from again.  That just leaves hydrophobic lady and her flashbacks of her dad drowning, jerky guy, and the screaming baby on the boat.  If you said that all this movie needs in order to get worse is a raging storm, you win a prize.During the storm, hydrophobic woman and jerky guy realize stabbed guy was on to something when he was hacking at the side of the boat (which jerky guy killed him over).  Jerky guy wedges the lens from the scuba mask in the hole stabbed guy punched in the side of the boat and hydrophobic lady stands on his hands and is able to reach the railing and haul herself over.  She lowers the electric ladder and jerky guy initially comes on board, but distraught that he essentially killed almost all of his friends, he chooses to go back in the water, so hydrophobic lady has to face her fear to go save him.  Hydrophobic lady and her baby are rescued the next day by the Coast Guard.  Jerky guy is shown laying face down on the deck, but it's not clear whether he's alive.  FIN. If you've read this far, I just saved you from watching two hours of this slop.  You're welcome.This was perhaps the most awful movie I've ever seen.  The acting and plot were just terrible.  This was based on a true story, so I can only hope that the screenwriter exaggerated the events to play up the drama.  A couple of closing thoughts: 1.  If I was hydrophobic, you'd never get my butt anywhere near a boat.  2.  What happened to the woman who struck off alone?  Did she drown?  Did she reach shore?  Was she rescued by sea turtles and Captain Jack Sparrow?  I need closure here, people.  3.  Why did I watch all of this movie?

The scenario is made more tragic because a baby is left alone onboard.  The film begins by trying too hard to make the characters and their friendship seem ""real"".  The character development is forced and made more annoying by showing the characters through the lens of a ""home-movie"".  Luckily all but the most well known of the cast, Eric Dane of Grey's Anatomy, actually do a really good acting job.  You will laugh out loud at the insincerity of his over the top confessional scene towards the end of the movie.  The movie gets better and entertaining once the group of friends find themselves overboard.  Panic sets in, and one by one the friends (predictably) die.  Suspense is sustained by the sheer awfulness of the situation.

I imagine that's because many people went into the theater expectingJaws. Open Water 2 is not exceptional, but it does have its moments.Open Water 2 tells the story of four high school friends getting together to celebrate one of their birthdays. Along for the ride are also a husband, a baby, and a lusty companion. The latter decides to go swimming, and eventually all follow her in, whether they like it or not. Immediately they realize that nobody dropped the ladder, and they struggle to find a way back to the boat.The six characters are stereotypes, and we learn nothing more about them during their struggles in the water. As can be expected, some are hysterical, while others are calm. Because the characters are stereotypes, it's difficult to feel sympathy for them. Not that their plights aren't worthy of sympathy - they most certainly are. Especially the baby. The baby wasn't an idiot and didn't deserve to be left alone.This is supposedly based on a true story. The key word, I believe, is based, because the ending is simply too contrived and I predicted it before they entered the water.One reviewer has expressed concerns that viewers have missed the point, and that we were expecting missing limbs, headless torsos, etc. I didn't miss the point. I get that the irony is that safety is inches away, but just beyond their reach, and that this irony is the ""thrill"" that the movie provides. My problem was that I didn't believe in the characters, didn't like them (I laughingly joked that before they even went into the water there were two deserving of a good drowning - all in good fun, mind you), and found the situations too fanciful and the writing too pedestrian.2  stars.",2,Not quite there,1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,1933,"['Open', 'Water', '2', ""n't"", 'sequel', 'toOpen', 'Water', 'rather', 'two', 'films', 'share', 'similar', 'stories', 'people', 'find', 'middle', 'ocean.Open', 'Waterwas', 'exceptional', 'film', ""n't"", 'get', 'recognition', 'broad', 'audience', 'imagine', 'because', 'many', 'people', 'went', 'theater', 'expectingJaws', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'not', 'exceptional', 'have', 'moments.Open', 'Water', '2', 'story', 'four', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'getting', 'together', 'celebrate', 'one', 'birthdays', 'ride', 'are', 'also', 'husband', 'baby', 'lusty', 'companion', 'latter', 'decides', 'go', 'swimming', 'eventually', 'follow', 'like', 'not', 'Immediately', 'realize', 'nobody', 'dropped', 'ladder', 'struggle', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'boat.The', 'six', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'learn', 'nothing', 'more', 'struggles', 'water', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'are', 'hysterical', 'others', 'are', 'calm', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'difficult', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Not', 'plights', 'are', ""n't"", 'worthy', 'sympathy', 'most', 'certainly', 'are', 'Especially', 'baby', 'baby', 'was', ""n't"", 'idiot', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'left', 'alone.This', 'supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'key', 'word', 'believe', 'based', 'ending', 'simply', 'too', 'contrived', 'predicted', 'entered', 'water.One', 'reviewer', 'expressed', 'concerns', 'viewers', 'have', 'missed', 'point', 'were', 'expecting', 'missing', 'limbs', 'headless', 'torsos', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'point', 'get', 'irony', 'safety', 'inches', 'away', 'just', 'reach', 'irony', 'thrill', 'movie', 'problem', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'laughingly', 'joked', 'even', 'went', 'water', 'were', 'two', 'deserving', 'good', 'drowning', 'good', 'fun', 'found', 'situations', 'too', 'fanciful', 'writing', 'too', 'pedestrian.2', 'stars']",Open Water 2: Adrift

1037951,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B000LC3IE2,Joshua Koppel,"[21, 23]","This is a thematic sequel to Open Water.  In this film, a group of friends are out on a yacht when some of them decide to go swimming.  One of the people who stay on the boat is deathly afraid of water due to a childhood trauma.  She puts on a life vest as soon as she exits her car even though the water is more than a hundred yards away.  Also on board are the woman's baby and her ex.  The ex is the cause of much of the later trouble.  Soon, through a twist of fate, all the adults are in the water leaving just the baby on board.  It is then that they realize they have no way of getting back on the boat.Most options are tried for getting back on board although maybe not in the order the viewer will think of.  The ladder is not down, the anchor is not down, and the sides are too high to reach.  At one point I did have to ask myself why the heaviest person was making the attempt at one point).  All options are tried and they fail in believable ways.  The real trouble comes from the fighting and bickering that springs up.  Why is the captain too stupid to make sure the ladder is down (it's believable)?  Eventually bad things begin to happen due to tiredness and carelessness.  People begin to die.  The story that progresses is tenser and better presented than in the first movie.Unlike in the first movie, we see how situations work out.  In the first movie there was a scene where a boat was coming at them and they start to wave but then the film jumps time and we don't know what went wrong , only that something must have.  In this movie all threads are followed through.  My only real problem was that when blood was in the water it never drew any predators (and it was in the water in quantity for hours).  But other than that I found this film much better than the first (although it had the opportunity to learn from the first one).  If you like tense survival films you will probably like this one.

Bernabo,"[3, 5]","Sequels really are miss or hit propositions and the rule of thumb these days is that if the two film scores a star less than the original then they are way ahead of the came.  Given all the sequels that are out there the number that are as least as good (e.g., ""The Godfather 2,"" ""Aliens"") let alone better (e.g., ""Spider-man 2""), are extremely rare.  ""Open Water 2"" (a.k.a. ""Adrift"" in Europe), had a chance of being as good as the original ""Open Water,"" but the ending is a bit too melodramatic for my taste.  However, it is nice to see plot justified nudity, which might be an even greater cinematic rarity these days.The set up is that a group of high school friends get together for a getaway on the yacht of Dan (Eric Dane), who is already having fun with Michelle (Cameron Richardson), his girlfriend of a fortnight when the others get on board.  Amy (Susan May Pratt) and James (Richard Speight Jr.) bring aboard their baby daughter Sarah, and then there are Lauren (Ali Hillis) and Zach (Niklaus Lange), who appear to finally be single at the same time.  Getting Amy on board is a big deal because when she was a little girl her father had a heart attack and drowned while they were swimming, so she has an understandable case of aquaphobia and walks around on deck with a life preserver on.  When Dan grabs her and jumps into the water she absolutely freaks and the next thing we know everybody else is in the water with her.  Then somebody notices that the ladder on the yacht was never deployed and they have no way of getting back on board.The movie is one of those that is ""based on actual events,"" although I think in this case it is just the basic idea of everybody on board being in the water and not being able to get back on the boat is the extent to which this story is based on actual events (to wit, this situation has happened more than once in the history of the world).  Consequently, it is the basic situation that rings true and not the number of people in the water, what they had, the baby on board, or the rest of what the screenwriters came up with here.  Maybe some of what they try to do to get back on board were things that have happened in real life or then again they might be the rest of creativity by the writers and actors.  For me the key thing is that this is a plausible situation and for somebody who watches the first episode of ""Survivor"" each season and halfway through comes to the conclusion that I would be dead at this point long before I was ever voted off the island it is relatively easy to relate to the sheer terror it invokes.With a half-dozen people in the water instead of only two there are exponentially more opportunities for conflict between the characters, which this film goes out of its way to exploit.  Several times I found myself thinking that these people would be in better shape if the right way would just die because addition by subtraction seemed like a reasonable response to the deteriorating situation.  However, it really is the situation more than the characters that matters here because the whole idea of what would you (or could you) do in this situation is the entire hook of the movie.  Unlike the first ""Open Water"" film, where the abandoned couple are floating in the ocean, dodging sharks and waiting for somebody on their charter to figure out they are missing, safety for these people treading water is so close they can touch it.  They just have to find a way to get back on board.This is where ""Open Water 2"" finds itself treading water, because for every bright idea that these people come up with there seems to be a corresponding act of stupidity.  Your enjoyment of this 2006 film will depend entirely on how much of this you can take before such things ruin the film for you.  The cell phone scene just about did me in, but I remained interested in the pragmatics of the situation, trying to think what they could do to save their lives and knowing that it was not going to be soon enough to ever save them all (a larger casts insures more deaths).  For me the ending is what caused me to round down instead of up on this film.  It is a good thing I was watching it on DVD instead of a theater (not that it ever came any where near the Zenith City), because I had to stop when the credits rolled and go back to make sure I understood what I was seeing (I still am not sure how to read the final three shots).  But the end game of ""Open Water 2"" wants to have its cake and eat it too, and opts for emphasizing the psychological problems of the characters over the practical considerations of staying alive, which is where melodrama swamps the decks of this film.",3,"This ""sequel"" does not maximize the potential of being adrift",1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,4658,"['Sequels', 'really', 'are', 'miss', 'hit', 'propositions', 'rule', 'thumb', 'days', 'two', 'film', 'scores', 'star', 'less', 'original', 'then', 'are', 'way', 'ahead', 'came', 'Given', 'sequels', 'are', 'there', 'number', 'are', 'as', 'least', 'good', 'e.g.', 'Godfather', '2', 'Aliens', 'let', 'alone', 'better', 'e.g.', 'Spider-man', '2', 'are', 'extremely', 'rare', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'a.k.a', 'Adrift', 'Europe', 'had', 'chance', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Open', 'Water', 'ending', 'bit', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'taste', 'However', 'nice', 'see', 'plot', 'justified', 'nudity', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'greater', 'cinematic', 'rarity', 'days.The', 'set', 'up', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'getaway', 'yacht', 'Dan', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'who', 'already', 'having', 'fun', 'Michelle', 'Cameron', 'Richardson', 'girlfriend', 'fortnight', 'when', 'others', 'get', 'board', 'Amy', 'Susan', 'May', 'Pratt', 'James', 'Richard', 'Speight', 'Jr.', 'bring', 'aboard', 'baby', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'then', 'are', 'Lauren', 'Ali', 'Hillis', 'Zach', 'Niklaus', 'Lange', 'who', 'appear', 'finally', 'be', 'single', 'same', 'time', 'Getting', 'Amy', 'board', 'big', 'deal', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'father', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'drowned', 'were', 'swimming', 'understandable', 'case', 'aquaphobia', 'walks', 'deck', 'life', 'preserver', 'When', 'Dan', 'water', 'absolutely', 'freaks', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'everybody', 'else', 'water', 'Then', 'somebody', 'notices', 'ladder', 'yacht', 'was', 'never', 'deployed', 'have', 'way', 'getting', 'back', 'board.The', 'movie', 'one', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'think', 'case', 'just', 'basic', 'idea', 'everybody', 'board', 'being', 'water', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'boat', 'extent', 'story', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'wit', 'situation', 'happened', 'more', 'once', 'history', 'world', 'Consequently', 'basic', 'situation', 'true', 'not', 'number', 'people', 'water', 'what', 'had', 'baby', 'board', 'rest', 'what', 'screenwriters', 'came', 'up', 'here', 'Maybe', 'what', 'try', 'do', 'get', 'back', 'board', 'were', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'then', 'again', 'might', 'be', 'rest', 'creativity', 'writers', 'actors', 'key', 'thing', 'plausible', 'situation', 'somebody', 'who', 'first', 'episode', 'Survivor', 'season', 'halfway', 'conclusion', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'point', 'long', 'was', 'ever', 'voted', 'off', 'island', 'relatively', 'easy', 'relate', 'sheer', 'terror', 'half-dozen', 'people', 'water', 'instead', 'only', 'two', 'are', 'exponentially', 'more', 'opportunities', 'conflict', 'characters', 'film', 'way', 'exploit', 'Several', 'times', 'found', 'thinking', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'shape', 'right', 'way', 'would', 'just', 'die', 'addition', 'subtraction', 'seemed', 'reasonable', 'response', 'deteriorating', 'situation', 'However', 'really', 'situation', 'more', 'characters', 'matters', 'here', 'whole', 'idea', 'what', 'would', 'could', 'do', 'situation', 'entire', 'hook', 'movie', 'first', 'Open', 'Water', 'film', 'where', 'abandoned', 'couple', 'are', 'floating', 'ocean', 'dodging', 'sharks', 'waiting', 'somebody', 'charter', 'figure', 'out', 'are', 'missing', 'safety', 'people', 'treading', 'water', 'so', 'close', 'can', 'touch', 'just', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'board.This', 'where', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'treading', 'water', 'bright', 'idea', 'people', 'come', 'up', 'there', 'be', 'corresponding', 'act', 'stupidity', 'enjoyment', '2006', 'film', 'will', 'depend', 'entirely', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'take', 'such', 'things', 'ruin', 'film', 'cell', 'phone', 'scene', 'just', 'about', 'did', 'remained', 'interested', 'pragmatics', 'situation', 'trying', 'think', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'save', 'lives', 'knowing', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'soon', 'enough', 'ever', 'save', 'larger', 'insures', 'more', 'deaths', 'ending', 'what', 'caused', 'round', 'down', 'instead', 'up', 'film', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'watching', 'DVD', 'instead', 'theater', 'not', 'ever', 'came', 'where', 'Zenith', 'City', 'had', 'stop', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'go', 'back', 'make', 'sure', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'still', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'read', 'final', 'three', 'shots', 'end', 'game', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'opts', 'emphasizing', 'psychological', 'problems', 'characters', 'practical', 'considerations', 'staying', 'alive', 'where', 'melodrama', 'decks', 'film']",Open Water 2: Adrift

At one moment all the six adults will find themselves in the water, with the baby abandoned alone on board - and they cannot climb back... The film is basically about what follows this unexpcted development.The whole situation already doesn't make much sense, considering that six young, strong and healthy people would find a way out of this situation in like five minutes - after all a yacht is not a super-tanker, it is not THAT high above water... But OK, for the sake of the film I was ready to accept that for some reason they cannot make it back to the yacht.However everything what follows is such an accumulation of human most irrational stupidity that I simply refuse to believe that it is possible to assemble incidentally such a bunch of morons and @holes in one place at one time - you would probably have to make a world wide casting for that... In fact those six people are so impossibly awful AND stupid that it is simply impossible to relate to  them - to my considerable shame at one moment I actually started to root for the merciless ocean...)))

But not having filed any voyage plan, telling someone where they were going, and/or their expected arrival - no one will come.Once they realize that there's no hope for rescue, playful self-assured shells of civility dissolve away, revealing their true personalities and deep inner selves. And it ain't pretty.Minor grudges become full blown emotional explosions, past differences rise to the surface and petty jealousies warp into pure hatred. Once past the adrenaline, the truth settles in. All that remains is how they choose to face their end.One by one, some by choice and others meeting the cold hand of nature, they disappear under the water.Sturdy storytelling that completely loses its razor edge with the ambiguous last scenes. Unfortunate. I'm no pedestrian viewer who has to have a ""Hollywood"" final&eacute;. And I definitely don't have a weepy need to spare sacred cows - like having a character survive. But the existential ending truly cheapens the suffering that the characters go through, leaving the film hollow and empty.Rent it for the drama alone. Skip the last few minutes, as your emotional investment will be tossed to the side in favor of the director's absurd attempt at a gotcha twist.Movie Note:- It may seem incredibly improbable, but check out the names ""MV Joyita"" and ""Mary Celeste"". Dark, inexplicable mysteries that have haunted sailors and investigators for years.Even as recent as 2007 this actually happened. Google the ""Kaz II"". To date no theory has ever fully explained what happened to her vanished three-man crew. She was found floating off the Great Barrier reef with fuel, food, water onboard and completely seaworthy.

When I heard there was a sequel, I figured it was going to be terrible. But then it started showing up on IFC rather than the Syfy Channel, and that got me thinking it might actually be better than I was giving it credit for. I was wrong; it's inestimably worse. I watched this right after La Papesse (q.v.), which was the worst movie I'd seen in quite a while. Well, that record didn't stand long.Plot: a bunch of young-and-beautifuls head out on a boat for one's birthday. They all go out for a swim (save one, who has an ocean phobia and a daughter--hey, can you guess who the final girl is in this flick?, but she gets thrown in by one of her so-called pals) and forget to let down the ladder. And yes, there they are, stuck in the water right next to the boat but unable to get onto it.While Open Water 2 is more technically competent than La Papesse, that's the only thing it's got going for it. Could Adam Kreutner (Dead Fish) have shoehorned any more clich&eacute;s into this movie? Actually, he probably could have, but I haven't been able to figure out how, from the stupid opening sequence (which makes you think you're getting a movie that's far more thematically linked to the original than you actually do) right down to the horrid music that plays during the ending you know is coming before you even start watching this movie.

Things go horribly wrong when, in their beered-up revelry, they all decide to jump ship and go for a swim. Panic ensues when they realize no one dropped the ladder and they have no way of getting back on the boat.There are some stunning moments of suspense as the characters try to figure a way out of their situation. One scene in which a character delves deep into the water and knocks his head on the ship following a frantic rise to the surface will cause any viewer to cry out in vicarious pain.The movie's star turn undoubtedly belongs to Susan May Pratt, who completely owns the screen every time she appears. Her turn as a suffering mother who entered the water involuntarily is easily the most sympathetic performance.Some reviewers have complained that there's no character development to be found in this film. Actually, we learn quite a bit about the supposed ""owner"" of the yaght. His confession about his professional life is straight out of ""Death of a Salesman.""This movie is not a sequel to the original ""Open Water,"" which may be a superior film.

Minor spoilers follow.Two couples, one with an infant daughter, board the Godspeed, a yacht owned by their friend Dan (Eric Dane), and head out to sea for a relaxing cruise.  The boat stops, and four of the party of six jump in the ocean for a little swim.  Amy (Susan May Pratt), the mother of the child has a fear of water, and is reluctant to enter.  In fun, Dan picks Amy up and jumps into the ocean carrying her in his arms.  Unfortunately what was intended as a joke has tragic consequences, as no one thought to lower the ladder, and panic sets in as the group of six discover that they are unable to get back onto the boat.The disaster occurs about 20 minutes in, and for most of the remaining 70 minutes, the cast are treading water.  The group appears to have few options, but one interesting scheme they do come up with, is to strip off their clothing, and tie them together make a rope.  It's an idea with some promise, but unfortunately when one of the heavier in the group attempts to climb up onto the boat, the rope tears.Naked in the water, one might expect hypothermia or fatigue to set in rather quickly, but other misfortunes strike the group first, which gradually begins to grow smaller.  Dan's reckless act caused the dilemma, but there's no shortage of irrational behavior misfortune, such as when a character panics while investigating the underside of the boat, and then gets severely injured while attempting to surface.Matters do drag on for too long, until finally a solution presents itself, but to the very end the behavior of these people seems out of touch with reality.  A film that tests your masochistic proclivities, Open Water 2 is not a fun time, but may be entertaining in a very dark twisted sort of way.Despite the farfetched story, the cast does a fairly good job of acting, considering that they are swimming through much of the film, and supposedly naked to boot.  Fate is certainly not kind to these poor souls, but at least they do not have to contend with sharks, as was the case in the originalOpen Water(2003).",3,swimming naked for hours...,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,2240,"['Foolishness', 'supreme', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'Adrift', '2006', 'adventure', 'where', 'group', 'friends', 'taking', 'pleasure', 'cruise', 'wind', 'up', 'swimming', 'much', 'longer', 'anticipated', 'Minor', 'spoilers', 'follow.Two', 'couples', 'one', 'infant', 'daughter', 'board', 'Godspeed', 'yacht', 'owned', 'friend', 'Dan', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'head', 'sea', 'relaxing', 'cruise', 'boat', 'stops', 'four', 'party', 'six', 'jump', 'ocean', 'little', 'swim', 'Amy', 'Susan', 'May', 'Pratt', 'mother', 'child', 'fear', 'water', 'reluctant', 'enter', 'fun', 'Dan', 'Amy', 'up', 'jumps', 'ocean', 'carrying', 'arms', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'joke', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'one', 'thought', 'lower', 'ladder', 'panic', 'sets', 'group', 'six', 'discover', 'are', 'unable', 'get', 'back', 'boat.The', 'disaster', '20', 'minutes', 'most', 'remaining', '70', 'minutes', 'cast', 'are', 'treading', 'water', 'group', 'have', 'few', 'options', 'one', 'interesting', 'scheme', 'do', 'come', 'up', 'strip', 'off', 'clothing', 'tie', 'together', 'make', 'rope', 'idea', 'promise', 'unfortunately', 'when', 'one', 'heavier', 'group', 'climb', 'up', 'boat', 'rope', 'tears.Naked', 'water', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'hypothermia', 'fatigue', 'set', 'rather', 'quickly', 'other', 'misfortunes', 'group', 'first', 'gradually', 'grow', 'smaller', 'Dan', 'reckless', 'act', 'caused', 'dilemma', 'shortage', 'irrational', 'behavior', 'misfortune', 'such', 'when', 'character', 'panics', 'investigating', 'underside', 'boat', 'then', 'severely', 'injured', 'attempting', 'surface.Matters', 'do', 'drag', 'too', 'long', 'finally', 'solution', 'very', 'end', 'behavior', 'people', 'touch', 'reality', 'film', 'masochistic', 'proclivities', 'Open', 'Water', '2', 'not', 'fun', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'entertaining', 'very', 'dark', 'twisted', 'sort', 'way.Despite', 'farfetched', 'story', 'cast', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'considering', 'are', 'swimming', 'much', 'film', 'supposedly', 'naked', 'boot', 'Fate', 'certainly', 'not', 'kind', 'poor', 'souls', 'least', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'contend', 'sharks', 'was', 'case', 'originalOpen', 'Water', '2003']",Open Water 2: Adrift

In this case, a group of five attractive friends in their 30s reunite on a luxury yacht.  We're first introduced to the five friends via flashback to one of their vacations five years earlier.  Now, Amy and James are married and have an infant daughter.  Zach and Lauren aren't dating but flirt and obviously like each other.  Finally, there's the sexist, egotistical owner of the yacht - Dan.  When the others arrive on the yacht, they find that Dan has made yet another sexual conquest in the form of the sexy 20-something Michelle, who joins the five friends for some ocean-going fun.  The friendships aren't ever fully spelled out (Dan and Amy seem to have some past together, for example); however, they clearly care about each other, but there's some tension as well.The six friends cruise to somewhere far offshore the coast of Mexico and start to drink.  They all seem to be having fun except for Amy, who is extremely afraid of the water due to a childhood trauma.  As Amy puts her baby down for a nap, several of the others decide to go for a swim.  When Amy arrives on the deck, only Dan is left, and he decides to try to ""help"" her conquer her fear of water....by picking her up and jumping overboard.  Bad idea.  Not only does Amy go into shock, but everyone realizes that Dan didn't seem to lower any kind of ladder so that they can climb back aboard.  Thanks Captain Dan!  As they frantically look for some way to get onto the yacht, they slowly begin to realize that they are in deep trouble.  The rest of the plot is difficult to describe without providing any spoilers, but suffice to say that the group continues to make some incredibly bad decisions that lead to tragedy.I greatly enjoyed the first ""Open Water"" movie, which was a low-budget hit that provided some nice surprises.  Nevertheless, I had very low expectations for this straight-to-DVD sequel, which was not created by the same people as the first movie.  However, I occasionally enjoy a high-concept piece of claptrap like this movie, so I decided to give it a try - and I was glad I did.  Although the movie is low budget and the script could have used some beefing up, ""Open Water 2"" provided some enjoyment, although admittedly rather dumb enjoyment.  This movie is one that you should probably not overthink, because you could easily spend the 135 minutes second-guessing everything the characters do.  Quite a few aspects aren't very realistic, including the amount of strength the friends still have after hours in the water.  In addition, these characters are somewhat annoying at times and clearly not meant to be particularly intelligent; however, their plight still provided some tension, especially as Amy realizes the consequences for her napping baby if they are not able to get back onboard.  It's definitely the kind of movie that might make you wonder whether you could make similar mistakes and how you'd try to save yourself.

But for all the blood they had in the water you didnt see one fish not even one sight of a shark, whale nothing.  For as long as they were splashing and all the blood it seems that there would be at least one fish.  And since the begining of the movie I was wondering why there where 3 guys and they didnt even think of trying to lift the lightest girl up or toss her nothing.  If I were stranded it would of been the first thing I thought of.  Especially if my baby was still on the boat alone.
