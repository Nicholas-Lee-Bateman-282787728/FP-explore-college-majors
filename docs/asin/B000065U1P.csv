699964,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000065U1P,andy8047,"[1, 2]","LOOK WHO'S TALKING NOW! Two dogs named Rocks and Daphne. Mikey and his half-sister Julie are now talking on their own so there no provided voices for them like the previous two films. Rocks was found by James Ubriacco(John Travolta). He tries to convince his wife Mollie(Kirstie Alley) to let Rocks become part of the Ubriacco household otherwise he'll be euthanized. Rocks,voiced by Danny DeVito,finds a mate of his own. Her name is Daphne,voiced by Diane Keaton. Get a load of DeVito exclaiming ""Schwing!"" when Rocks eyeballs Daphne. The exclamatory word was inspired by the two Wayne's World movies and the Saturday Night Live skit that spun them off. James,now an airline pilot and no longer driving taxicabs,becomes involved in a scam orchestrated by a business associate of his. The scam is eventually thwarted. The associate(Lysette Anthony) even threatens to kill Rocks. She and James,alone in a cabin,are found by Rocks,Daphne,Mollie and the Ubriaccos' children. The deceptive associate is taken into police custody.",5,"First Mikey,then Julie,now 2 dogs named Rocks and Daphne",1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,1025,"['LOOK', 'WHO', 'TALKING', 'NOW', 'Two', 'dogs', 'named', 'Rocks', 'Daphne', 'Mikey', 'half-sister', 'Julie', 'are', 'now', 'talking', 'own', 'so', 'provided', 'voices', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'Rocks', 'was', 'found', 'James', 'Ubriacco', 'John', 'Travolta', 'convince', 'wife', 'Mollie', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'let', 'Rocks', 'become', 'part', 'Ubriacco', 'household', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'euthanized', 'Rocks', 'voiced', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'mate', 'own', 'name', 'Daphne', 'voiced', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Get', 'load', 'DeVito', 'exclaiming', 'Schwing', 'when', 'Rocks', 'Daphne', 'exclamatory', 'word', 'was', 'inspired', 'two', 'Wayne', 'World', 'movies', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'skit', 'spun', 'off', 'James', 'now', 'airline', 'pilot', 'longer', 'driving', 'taxicabs', 'becomes', 'involved', 'scam', 'orchestrated', 'business', 'associate', 'scam', 'eventually', 'thwarted', 'associate', 'Lysette', 'Anthony', 'even', 'kill', 'Rocks', 'James', 'alone', 'cabin', 'are', 'found', 'Rocks', 'Daphne', 'Mollie', 'Ubriaccos', 'children', 'deceptive', 'associate', 'taken', 'police', 'custody']",N/A

The dogs, or course, are the best part, voiced by Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton.  This movie is great for kids or adults.

What I like about the movie is that now that the kids finally know how to talk, this family is going to the dogs! Thanks to the unique voice talents of Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton as two canine comedians determined to turn the household upside down. Look Who's Talking Now is as fresh and funny as the original. John Travolta and Kirstie Alley return as the fun-loving parents whose marriage is put to the test when she loses a job and he finds one... with a lady boss who shows an over-active interest in merging. Loaded with one-liners and enough humor for kids and adults alike, Look Who's Talking Now proves that when it comes to comedy, it's a dog's life!
