686306,AMUTYOX234D90,B00005UW80,Bill,"[10, 11]","First, let me say that I don't bow at the altar of Sondheim. I find some of his songs incredibly beautiful and others witty but less melodically enjoyable. So, why five stars for this revue? Because the performers are exceptional.I honestly feel this is Carol Burnett's best performance. I used to believe that it was practically impossible for her to sing seriously, with sincere emotion. It always seemed that she simply placed a serious veneer over her comic persona. But the years have given her the emotional depth to be able to carry off the challenging dramatic weight of the songs she's handed here. Her subtle and well-sung interpretations of &quot;Every Day a Little Death&quot; and &quot;Could I Leave You&quot; hold up against any others.But that's not all. Let me give equally enthusiastic praise to the two younger performers, John Barrowman and Ruthie Henshall. They are, as others have said here, simply spectacular. They've got it all -- great voices, talent, looks. Both deserve shows of their own.This DVD is not to be missed.

I enjoyed it a lot, especially the performance of Carol Burnett, who I think does some of her best work here.  The whole cast does a marvelous job of the material, singing and dancing very well.  The blooper is a riot and typical of Carol Burnett's sense of humour.  She's a pro all the way and makes the best of something very embarrassing that happens(I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it).

686310,A1JBYKGKG6SVPN,B00005UW80,Kimberly Wade,"[5, 7]","Stephen Sondheim's Putting It Together rocks! The music leaves you in awe the cast is surely the best revival of the class show I love John Barrowman's version's of Marry Me A Little, Pretty Women, of course his short song That's The Answer For me. Ruthie Henshall surely pulls off some of the most diffculust songs my favorties from her are I Always Get My Men, Lovely, More, and Unworthy Of Your Love. George Hern numbers are slow and steady that's how I like them favorties from him that I like are Hello Little Girl, Rich And Happy, and What Do You Want To Get Married For? Carol Burnett's are comical and stunning especially her versions of I'm Not Getting Married Today, How Could I Leave You?, Lovely, and My Husaband The Pig. Bronson Pinchot is one of the best for last his best numbers are Bang! and that's all! The best group numbers are Being Alive, Putting It Together, Let The Good Times Roll, Rich and Happy # 4. My favortie cast member is John Barrowman he is a stud, golden-voice, well dressed, perfect hair actor. Being Alive is such a good number in the production nobody can pull off five people singing at once and we can still hear what they are singing. Beside the Music and The Cast the blooper sounds very funny John Barrowman laughing and kicking his heels up after Carol's strap broke right on stage.

McDermott,"[2, 7]","The staging is forced and stiff and the plot barely existent -- I have to say I enjoy listening to the original cast recording more than watching this staged production, but it's never a waste of time to watch talented performers singing Sondheim's marvelous songs.  George Hearn's energy can't match his costars', and, while  Bronson Pinchot's singing is better than Christopher Durand's in the original, he can never match Durand's arch hilarity.  Still, each singer gets to shine in individual moments, the greatest of which is Carol Burnett's &quot;Ladies Who Lunch&quot; -- a song I never cared for until I saw/heard her furious interpretation.  Sondheim purists may object to the way the cast sometimes plays fast-and-loose with tempos, but there's not a bad voice in the bunch and the orchestration is elegant, allowing the singers to shine.

686312,A1UYNO24EXETXE,B00005UW80,M. G ORELL,"[27, 28]","From the people who brought you the live taping of Jekyll and Hyde starring David Hasselhoff comes a new live taping. It's Stephen Sondheim's Putting It Together. Every moment is memorable from the moment Bronson Pinchot opens the show by telling us that he's been replaced by Regis Philbin to the End Credits. The musical is about 5 people at a cocktail party. An old couple (played by Broadway legends Carol Burnett, of Annie fame, and George Hearn, who recently did Sweeney Todd in Concert)host the party. The guests are a younger couple (played by John Barrowman and the amazing Ruthie Henshall, who is known for her performance as Fantine in Les Miserables in Concert) and a man who is simply known as the Observer. He shows us what kind of themes are in a show by Sondheim such as Seduction or Happiness. There are a lot of songs from many Sondheim plays and some from the movie, Dick Tracy. Sadly, there is only one song from my ultimate favorite Sondheim musical, Into the Woods. It's playing on Broadway. The only song is Hello Little Girl, which is played as a sexual encounter. Of course, it's being played as a sexual encounter on Broadway as well. There are some songs that were cut from some Sondheim musicals such as My Husband, the Pig, which was cut from A Little Night Music. I noticed that most of the title song, except for the first two verses, had been rewritten. My only complaints are that during the title song, George Hearn's microphone goes out. Now that's an onstage blooper. Plus, they didn't show the Entr'acte. Instead, they jumped right to the first song of the second act. Mind you, this might have all been filmed in one night. It might have possibly been the night that the onstage blooper occured. In case anyone's wondering, the onstage blooper was not Carol Burnett messing up in a song. They had started the second act. Every thing was going fine until Carol Burnett told the conductor to stop. Then, she pulled up her skirt and said, ""You know what's about to happen?"" Then, she let go of her skirt and it fell to the ground. One of the straps broke. John Barrowman was laughing and yelling, ""Please tell me you got that on tape."" Your wish came true, Johnny. The onstage blooper also incorporates the lost Entr'acte, which is an instrumental of You Could Drive A Person Crazy. Plus, the role of the Wife has not only been played by Carol Burnett but by her dear friend, Julie Andrews. That was in London. One more thing.

Wish it had a separate CD sountrack available.If you only think of Carol Burnett for her comedy, you will be pleasantly surprised, she can sing, too. George Hearn is in fine singing form, as always.

John Barrowman (from Doctor Who) is great, and watching Bronson Pinchot made you wish he had more solos.Ruthie Henshall was in a way the weakest part of the show--her accent was somewhat annoying (on the order of Marina Sirtis' accent in Star Trek: TNG--if that grated on your ears, Ms. Henshall's will too), but she can sing and dance well.I can't say that I liked all of the original shows (e.g. Sunday in the Park with George) these songs came from, but watching this DVD makes you want to seek out the original shows to view or re-view, as the case might be.Well worth buying!",5,Great performances....,1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,872,"['Love', 'DVD', 'Wish', 'had', 'separate', 'CD', 'sountrack', 'available.If', 'only', 'think', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'comedy', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'can', 'sing', 'too', 'George', 'Hearn', 'fine', 'singing', 'form', 'always', 'two', 'together', 'looked', 'sounded', 'real-life', 'married', 'couple', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'great', 'watching', 'Bronson', 'Pinchot', 'made', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'solos.Ruthie', 'Henshall', 'was', 'way', 'weakest', 'part', 'show', 'accent', 'was', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'order', 'Marina', 'Sirtis', 'accent', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'grated', 'ears', 'Ms.', 'Henshall', 'will', 'too', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'well.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'liked', 'original', 'shows', 'e.g', 'Sunday', 'Park', 'George', 'songs', 'came', 'watching', 'DVD', 'want', 'seek', 'out', 'original', 'shows', 'view', 're-view', 'case', 'might', 'be.Well', 'worth', 'buying']",Stephen Sondheim's Putting It Together - A Musical Review

It's a much more rewording viewing experience than the attempt to recapture the theatre experience in a studio.Well, MacKintosh put it together once again, and we can all be glad of it!  This is one of those very rare theatre treats in a time when theatre is tending to get more and more about less and less.  The combination of Stephen Sondheim's music and the talents of the likes of Carol Burnett, George Hearn, Ruthie Henshall, John Barrowman and Bronson Pinchot is really more than a theatre enthusiast dare wish for, but it's all there on this DVD.  If that weren't enough, we also get the extra treat of a little on-stage blooper that took place the evening this was filmed, which caused Burnett to literally stop the show.  This is added as extra footage, which will have you falling on the floor laughing as it did John Barrowman.Carol Burnett shines through it all, but will reduce you to tears of laughter with her renditions of ""Lovely"" from ""A Funny Thing Happened..."" and ""I'm not Getting Married Today"" from ""Company"".  That said, she also pulls of some very touching moments, such as ""Old Friends"" from ""Merrily We Roll Along"".  Hearn's voice is still, despite his age, beautiful and strong.  Ruthie Henshall wows you on several occasions, but especially with ""More"" from ""Dick Tracey"".  John Barrowman, who tends at times to be stiff like a body-buider, overcomes this for the most part, and manages to pull off some difficult dancing and singing with a sweet charm that you would not normally associate with a man built like a football player.  The surprise of the evening is Bronson Pinchot in his first musical role.  That he is a talented, slapstick comedian is known since he starred in ""Blame it on the Bellboy"", but who would have thought that he could sing, too!  He has the timing and agility of Charley Chaplin with the grace and style of Fred Astaire.
