743028,A32MCD01AP5JP5,B00008J2FC,Anthony Peak,"[7, 9]","Please Teacher is a pretty good anime, but it falls short from being anything more. If you're not expecting a masterpiece, it can be quite entertaining really. There's a good amount of humor and some fun characters to follow. The story is rather weak, but it's good enough.The relationship between Mizuho and Kei just never seems to click. It never seems to stop being awkward, and that's really ashame. I just can't agree with some of the &quot;choices&quot; made in the series, and I know anyone in that position would not choose the path in this series. It feels stretched with no explanation of why. Mizuho makes even less sense in this fashion. I'm being quite vague, but I don't want to spoil things.Frankly I think they just tried way too hard. Just when you think things might finally get on track, they're jerked back again and without warning, things take a sharp left turn. It barrows far too much from series like Ah! My Goddess and does a rather poor job at it.This isn't a series I'd recommend, as hard as that is for me to say about any anime. If you've watched all the other recent animes and you need something new, go for it. Otherwise, use caution. It's not horrible, in fact I had a rather good time watching it.

743029,A28RFOF6EY42F4,B00008J2FC,"""asu-san""","[7, 7]","Please Teacher was a series that I'd seen selling at Japanese online stores, like Amazon Japan.  Based on it's popularity there, I decided it would be worth the investment ($100 for all four DVDs), and immediately bought the first DVD when it became available.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  I found the story to be emotionally charged but with enough fun to keep things in control.Though it can be viewed as a bit predictable and cliche, Please Teacher's story deals with a simple question.  Why must there be both happiness and sadness?  Kei, the male lead, faces the dilema head on and finds the answer with the help Mizuho, the female lead, and his friends.  They learn that life is NOT all laughs; a person must deal with the highs and lows of life.  That you can't be happy 100% of the time unless you come to a complete stand still.  That you can't force someone else to be happy nor should you sacrifice your happiness in order to create happiness in someone else's life.This series is not for someone who is looking for a whimsical story, but, if you're an emotional person who empathizes with movie characters, I recommend Please Teacher.",5,A Pleasant Surprise,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,1192,"['Please', 'Teacher', 'was', 'series', ""'d"", 'seen', 'selling', 'Japanese', 'online', 'stores', 'Amazon', 'Japan', 'Based', 'popularity', 'there', 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'investment', '100', 'four', 'DVDs', 'immediately', 'bought', 'first', 'DVD', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'definitely', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'enough', 'fun', 'keep', 'things', 'control.Though', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'bit', 'predictable', 'cliche', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'story', 'deals', 'simple', 'question', 'Why', 'must', 'there', 'be', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'Kei', 'male', 'lead', 'dilema', 'head', 'answer', 'help', 'Mizuho', 'female', 'lead', 'friends', 'learn', 'life', 'NOT', 'person', 'must', 'deal', 'highs', 'lows', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', '100', '%', 'time', 'come', 'complete', 'stand', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'force', 'someone', 'else', 'be', 'happy', 'should', 'sacrifice', 'happiness', 'order', 'create', 'happiness', 'someone', 'else', 'life.This', 'series', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'looking', 'whimsical', 'story', ""'re"", 'emotional', 'person', 'who', 'movie', 'characters', 'recommend', 'Please', 'Teacher']",N/A

The anime...My problem is that I read the books (manga) first. The books are excellent and the anime follows the books (at least in the first disk) very closely. Thus, no surprises.On top of that, it seemed to me that the situations that the kids were put into that were supposed to be awkward were forced. Thrown in your face in such a way where the awkwardness was lost for the sake of making the situation as obvious as possible.The great thing about the books is that you had to read between the panels and I think there was a lot more emotional byplay there than in the anime.I hear the next disk breaks away from the books a bit and I'm willing to give it a try for that reason - to see if it stands on its own or not.I will say that this Manga to Anime translation is a lot better than &quot;Real bout High&quot; of which the Manga is 5 stars plus and the Anime would be less than one given the option.",3,Compared to the Manga...,1063584000,"09 15, 2003",2003,1021,"['watched', 'first', 'disk', 'much', 'anticipation', 'was', 'somewhat', 'let', 'down.The', 'art', 'good', 'music', 'decent', 'anime', 'problem', 'read', 'books', 'manga', 'first', 'books', 'are', 'excellent', 'anime', 'books', 'least', 'first', 'disk', 'very', 'closely', 'Thus', 'surprises.On', 'top', 'seemed', 'situations', 'kids', 'were', 'put', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'awkward', 'were', 'forced', 'Thrown', 'face', 'such', 'way', 'where', 'awkwardness', 'was', 'lost', 'sake', 'making', 'situation', 'as', 'obvious', 'possible.The', 'great', 'thing', 'books', 'had', 'read', 'panels', 'think', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'emotional', 'byplay', 'there', 'anime.I', 'hear', 'next', 'disk', 'breaks', 'away', 'books', 'bit', ""'m"", 'willing', 'give', 'try', 'reason', 'see', 'own', 'not.I', 'will', 'say', 'Manga', 'Anime', 'translation', 'lot', 'better', 'quot', 'Real', 'High', 'quot', 'Manga', '5', 'stars', 'Anime', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'one', 'given', 'option']",N/A

It's a terrific blend of romance and comedy (Sometimes, extremely funny) and enough seriousness to keep things in balance.A couple things keep it away from 5 stars, however. It is a bit predictable, and some of the main characters are neglected or just plain uninteresting. In the last few episodes, be ready for a complete change in atmosphere, and even though this is done on purpose, it is pretty taxing on the viewer.Also, the OVA (Which I'm guessing will be released in the future) is downright silly, but essential for fans of Please Teacher.The content is cleaner than you might expect.

743033,A2HH9HB8IVSNAH,B00008J2FC,"J. Fink ""hodgemo2""","[4, 7]","There are quite a few good things about Please Teacher.  First of all, there are some fairly unique story elements.  (at least one or two).  The girl who came from the heavens isn't quite unique, but it was a notch above the standard girl meets boy routine.  And Kei's illness is quite an interesting idea.  Secondly, the animation is gorgeous...at least in the main characters.  Kei's aunt and uncle aren't very pretty (and why does the aunt NEVER open her eyes?), but Kei, Koishi, Miss Kazumi, and the rest of Kei's friends are all very nicely done.This is one series where I don't just think that the English dub is better than the japanese, I don't like the japanese at all.  Everyone sounds the same!  There is very little of the emotion you usually hear in the japanese  voice acting.  And while I'm not overly fond of the English dub, at least you can tell who is talking if you have your eyes closed.  And I love Ichigo's dead pan, indifferent style of talking.  (although I must admit it threw me for a loop at first).But beyond that...nothing really grabs me.  Even though I did watch the first 3 (of 4) DVDs to this series in a stretch, it wasn't because I HAD to know what happened, or really felt connected with the characters...it was mainly because I was just, well...bored.  This is a very easy series to watch.  It doesn't take any effort at all.  But the charcters are slightly annoying at times.  Kei, while I understand is dealing with some HUGE issues, is a little too whiny for me, especially in the 1st DVD.  And Miss Kazumi, though she comes from a far more civilized race, and has been selected out of her entire race to gather information (and therefore must have SOMETHING on the ball)...she's just a little too dim witted for my liking.The music is OK, but it doesn't draw me in like the opening sequences of Pretear, His and Her Circumstances, Neon Genesis Evangelion, or Noir.  (I gave the range of anime genres for top music)  The DVD extras aren't really too exciting.  Just the standard clean opening/closing sequences.  And, as with all 13 episode series, after the first DVD, there are only 3 episodes per DVD.All in all, I don't dislike this series.  It is cute, it is warm spirited...it just doesn't grab me and pull me in.  It doesn't make me want to start reading the manga, or collecting the figures, or even the sound track.  I believe it fully deserves a place in any anime lovers collection, but there are many other series out there that are much more...convincing.",3,"Cute, but nothing really grabs me...",1092009600,"08 9, 2004",2004,2509,"['are', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'First', 'all', 'are', 'fairly', 'unique', 'story', 'elements', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'girl', 'who', 'came', 'heavens', ""n't"", 'quite', 'unique', 'was', 'notch', 'standard', 'girl', 'meets', 'boy', 'routine', 'Kei', 'illness', 'quite', 'interesting', 'idea', 'Secondly', 'animation', 'gorgeous', 'least', 'main', 'characters', 'Kei', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'pretty', 'why', 'aunt', 'NEVER', 'eyes', 'Kei', 'Koishi', 'Miss', 'Kazumi', 'rest', 'Kei', 'friends', 'are', 'very', 'nicely', 'done.This', 'one', 'series', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'think', 'English', 'dub', 'better', 'japanese', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'japanese', 'Everyone', 'same', 'very', 'little', 'emotion', 'usually', 'hear', 'japanese', 'voice', 'acting', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'fond', 'English', 'dub', 'least', 'can', 'tell', 'who', 'talking', 'have', 'eyes', 'closed', 'love', 'Ichigo', 'dead', 'pan', 'indifferent', 'style', 'talking', 'must', 'admit', 'threw', 'loop', 'first', '.But', 'nothing', 'really', 'grabs', 'Even', 'did', 'watch', 'first', '3', '4', 'DVDs', 'series', 'stretch', 'was', ""n't"", 'HAD', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'really', 'felt', 'connected', 'characters', 'was', 'mainly', 'was', 'just', 'well', 'bored', 'very', 'easy', 'series', 'watch', ""n't"", 'take', 'effort', 'charcters', 'are', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'times', 'Kei', 'understand', 'dealing', 'HUGE', 'issues', 'little', 'too', 'whiny', 'especially', '1st', 'DVD', 'Miss', 'Kazumi', 'far', 'more', 'civilized', 'race', 'been', 'selected', 'entire', 'race', 'gather', 'information', 'therefore', 'must', 'have', 'SOMETHING', 'ball', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'dim', 'witted', 'liking.The', 'music', 'OK', ""n't"", 'draw', 'opening', 'sequences', 'Pretear', 'Her', 'Circumstances', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'Noir', 'gave', 'range', 'anime', 'genres', 'top', 'music', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'too', 'exciting', 'Just', 'standard', 'clean', 'opening/closing', 'sequences', '13', 'episode', 'series', 'first', 'DVD', 'are', 'only', '3', 'episodes', 'DVD.All', 'do', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'series', 'cute', 'warm', 'spirited', 'just', ""n't"", 'grab', 'pull', ""n't"", 'make', 'want', 'start', 'reading', 'manga', 'collecting', 'figures', 'even', 'sound', 'track', 'believe', 'fully', 'place', 'anime', 'lovers', 'collection', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'there', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'convincing']",N/A
