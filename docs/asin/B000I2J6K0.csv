1018516,A2OU9Y8IE1M8UL,B000I2J6K0,"Amazon Customer ""Kimberly""","[0, 0]","This is a workout for folks who have been exercising all along and are looking for a prenatal workout that isn't too slow or easy. If you are out of shape or new to exercise try something like Crunch Yoga Mama or walk. This workout makes me feel really good when I'm done.  To be honest, I don't really enjoy this workout; I don't get lost in the exercises like I do with other workouts. I really like Kyra Landgolf's Total Body Tone.  There's a 7 mo pregnant exerciser in the video who modifies the workout for pregnancy.  This is the workout I'd recommend if you were an exerciser before and want to continue. But, back to this workout.  Expect lots of squats, some upper body work through modified pushups, some tricep dips, a few ballet moves, pilates floorwork and stretches.  Your heartrate will go up, you will sweat and you will feel really good when you are done. I haven't had the same aches and pains that I had with my first pregnancy.  I think the video is worth a try, maybe you'll connect with it more than I have.",4,Good prenatal workout,1218844800,"08 16, 2008",2008,1029,"['workout', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'exercising', 'are', 'looking', 'prenatal', 'workout', ""n't"", 'too', 'slow', 'easy', 'are', 'shape', 'new', 'exercise', 'try', 'something', 'Crunch', 'Yoga', 'Mama', 'walk', 'workout', 'feel', 'really', 'good', 'when', ""'m"", 'done', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lost', 'exercises', 'do', 'other', 'workouts', 'really', 'Kyra', 'Landgolf', 'Total', 'Body', 'Tone', '7', 'mo', 'pregnant', 'exerciser', 'video', 'who', 'workout', 'pregnancy', 'workout', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'were', 'exerciser', 'want', 'continue', 'back', 'workout', 'Expect', 'lots', 'squats', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'modified', 'pushups', 'tricep', 'dips', 'few', 'ballet', 'moves', 'floorwork', 'stretches', 'heartrate', 'will', 'go', 'up', 'will', 'sweat', 'will', 'feel', 'really', 'good', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'same', 'aches', 'had', 'first', 'pregnancy', 'think', 'video', 'try', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'connect', 'more', 'have']",PRENATAL FITNESS FIX

I bought three prenatal dvds b/c I want to be more fit through this pregnancy than during my last, and to be able to bounce back easier.  I think this one should really help in achieving my goal.The first time I did this workout I found the music a little annoying and my furniture layout wasn't quite right.  She does tend to go right into moves without a lot of explanation beforehand but, it was generally easy to pick up the moves.  Except during a couple of exercises that have you looking down and she's either not speaking or it is very soft.  After my first session I spent an entire weekend in agony, it really left me sore!The next time I did the workout it was a bit easier and I felt pretty good afterward.  This really works a lot of muscles!

If I made a workout video this is exactly how  I'd do it.Every week I walk & use elliptical twice and do yoga and I felt this video to be a very good workout. I couldn't keep up the first time around (8 months pregnant), but love that it will challenge me the next few weeks until the labor. It is great preparation with all the squatting too.

It's great cardio + strength, but very safe.  Many other prenatal workouts I've tried are kind of slow and overly gentle, but when I do non-prenatal workouts I have to modify or skip a bunch of parts which is never very satisfying.  This one I could do everything, the instruction was excellent, the pacing perfect, plus Erin just makes things fun.The workout length of 40 minutes I feel is perfect, and the warmup and cooldown/relaxation sections are among the best I've seen for any workout, prenatal or not--they really do their job and are a nice mix of core work and stretch of exactly what was worked.The only part of this DVD I have to skip is the additional 20-minute partner workout, because not only would my partner not be willing to stand there and let me use him as a workout prop for 20 minutes, but I don't think I'd want him to.

1018520,APSCKXH4SVN0J,B000I2J6K0,Jean Fernandez,"[1, 9]","What kind of DVD is this. it is way to rigorous for our pregnant bodies! Being pregnant is about staying healthy for you and your growing baby, not focusing on your weight and pant size. Those should be the last thing on your mind. As far a weight goes, try to stay with the guidelines of a weight gain of 25-35 pounds, and don't freak out if you a gain a little more! i feel that most of us, me included, chose to do these work out to keep up with the unrealistic standards of the media. It seems that a ton of these mom gaina massive amount of weight and then magically drop down to their old sizes with in months.  Look at Kate Hudson. It is reported that she gained way more than the recommended weight and she lost it all with three hour per day workout sessions. Starlets have trainers, nutritionists, and full time nannies to help them get red carpet ready. If you want some positive role models, look at Jennifer Garner and Jenny McCarthy. It took them over a year to loose the weight because they did it the healthy way. They were realistic and took their time. McCarthy credits weight Watchers as her key to success. This program helped me greatly with my post pregnancy weight loss. My complaints for this system... its too strenuous for our growing bodies, I hated the parts in which her Desperate Housewife star husband engages in the work out are a bit sexual, I felt I was watching a pregnancy guide to sex, and I thought it was hilarious when she was doing push ups, real push ups...are push ups going to get me ready for child birth?
