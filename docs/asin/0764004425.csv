2343,A15E01890A5IX5,0764004425,Alison Leigh,"[13, 13]","Wuthering Heights, a tale of forbidden love and revenge, has fascinated readers for generations. Heathcliff, a young vagabond, is charitably brought to the estate of Wuthering Heights to live by the kind Mr. Earnshaw. His son Hindley repudiates the boy, while daughter Cathy latches on to the young Heathcliff, and they soon become inseparable. The love story that follows transcends time, as Heathcliff will stop at nothing to be with the love of his life.London Weekend Television has done a wonderful job in bringing Emily Bronte's famed classic novel to the screen. There have been many adaptations, but this is the first one that I know of that remains wholly faithful to the book.Orla Brady gives a wonderful performance as the spirited Cathy, while Crispin Bonham Carter truly shines as Cathy's husband Edgar Linton. Robert Cavanah does the role of Heathcliff justice, but I believe he looked a bit old for the part; especially against the youthful looking Brady.For anyone who wants a complete and faithful adaptation of Emily Bronte's wonderful story, look to this version of Wuthering Heights.",5,Emily Bronte's COMPLETE Story!,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,1103,"['Wuthering', 'Heights', 'tale', 'forbidden', 'love', 'revenge', 'fascinated', 'readers', 'generations', 'Heathcliff', 'young', 'vagabond', 'charitably', 'brought', 'estate', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'live', 'kind', 'Mr.', 'Earnshaw', 'son', 'Hindley', 'boy', 'daughter', 'Cathy', 'young', 'Heathcliff', 'soon', 'become', 'inseparable', 'love', 'story', 'transcends', 'time', 'Heathcliff', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'be', 'love', 'life.London', 'Weekend', 'Television', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'bringing', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'famed', 'classic', 'novel', 'screen', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'adaptations', 'first', 'one', 'know', 'wholly', 'faithful', 'book.Orla', 'Brady', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'spirited', 'Cathy', 'Crispin', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'truly', 'Cathy', 'husband', 'Edgar', 'Linton', 'Robert', 'Cavanah', 'role', 'Heathcliff', 'justice', 'believe', 'looked', 'bit', 'old', 'part', 'especially', 'youthful', 'looking', 'Brady.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'complete', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'wonderful', 'story', 'look', 'version', 'Wuthering', 'Heights']",N/A

2345,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,0764004425,Andrew Raker,"[6, 6]","Overview:Film shows a lot of action. Narration plays a very minimal role. Showing the action rather than telling it also allows for a pleasant viewing experience. In other words, a viewer can feel engaged in the film, rather than find the film cheesy.The film does not make Heathcliff appear as insane as 1992 adaptation. Furthermore, the film is clearer in telling the story than 1992 adaptation. In other words, in the 1992 adaptation, characters change localities without the viewer understanding why. While this adaptation does not completely explain, it does provide additional scenes not included in 1992 adaptation. The scenes in 1992 adaptation not included in this adaptation are mostly non-essential scenes dealing with over-scripted romantic conversation between Catherine and Heathcliff.Contrast between 1992 and 1998 adaptations. Reasons why I think the 1998 is better.1.Nelly's character is much better developed in 1998 adaptation. In fact, minor characters are overall better developed in 1998 adaptation.2.Heathcliff appears more sincerely distraught in 1998 adaptation. He appears more insane in 1992 adaptation.3.Class and historical, time-sensitive issues are covered better in 1998 adaptation than 1992 adaptation (ex: Catherine's desire to marry Edgar for money. Heathcliff's desire to have Catherine II marry Linton so he could obtain Thrushcross Grange).4.1998 adaptation shows the story better by visual sequences rather than just a narrator's voice. In other words, the 1998 adaptation is more interesting than the 1992 adaptation.5.1992 adaptation does keep two points that the 1998 adaptation does not. (1) It keeps the beautiful/stormy weather scene, and (2) The scene where Catherine tells Heathcliff that if he kisses her again, she will die.6.1992 adaptation is 16:9 aspect ratio. The 1998 adaptation is 4:3 ratio.

First of all, one has to keep in mind that this is a 2-hr movie, it's got to be edited unmercifully to fit into that time frame.  I have mixed feelings about it.  The emphasis here is completely taken off of Catherine and her relationship with Heatchliff.  It's all about him and what happened after her death.  I must admit I detested that whole part of the movie where Heathcliff and Catherine are running around the lands, giggling and frolicking and pretending to be in their 20s while all the time looking like the 40 year olds that they are. Actually I really got into the movie and was able to enjoy it only after Catherine died.  Many commented on her bad acting - I disagree.  She has a small part in the movie, acts 20 min or so in the entire movie and half of it she is supposed to pretend to be 20.  I think she did the best she could with what she was given.  Heathcliff did very well once he didnt have to act the teenager (which was a misarable failure, I guess it was not possible to make him look younger, no Benjamin Button budget), an interesting portrayal all in all.  It was the second generation actors  that made the movie come to life.  Matthew McF. commands attention anytime he is on screen without even uttering a word.  Him and the 2nd Catherine were delightful and authentic.I give 4 stars as a stand-alone movie, loosely based on the novel.  If I was forced to judge it as an adaptation solely and if one is looking for a faithful one - it's rather disappointing (about 2 stars).(PS : 2009 I liked for exactly opposite parts - Catherine and Heathcliff were fabulous in the intensitiy and passion, though it was hard to find any gypsy in that actor, physically he's not what one would expect.

Flora Montgomery provides  a sympathetic but petulant and childish Isabella Linton , and Ian Shaw expertly portrays the descent from Hindley as master of Wuthering heights to the alcoholic shell of a man brutalized in revenge for the treatment he once gave him by Heathcliff.The younger set are also well done, with Sarah Smart as a beautiful Catherine Linton, with some of the fire of her mother but more love and goodness within her. with her blond curls and pretty face, exactly as described by Bronte. We see her character when she stands up to Heathcliff's cruelty to her. Matthew Macfadyen plays the rugged rough diamond Hareton Earnshaw who Hethcliff tries to ruin, and the end shows both Heathcliff's desperate end and rejoining with his beloved Catherine in the spirit world, and the joining of the two lovers Cathy Linton and Hareton in the plosive and hopeful ending Bronte wrote of.Linton Heathcliff played by William Mannering while providing  the self-pitying and sickness of Linton does not display the maelvolence of that character as Bronte wrote of in her novel .My main quibble with the movie was the character of Nelly Dean who was Hindley's contemporary in the book and not an elderly woman as played by Polly Hemingway.But the best version I have seen and the recommended one for teachers of the novel wanting to show the film version to the class",5,Best version I have seen,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,2253,"['have', 'read', 'book', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'several', 'times', 'seen', 'two', 'other', 'film', 'versions', '1939', 'Olivier/Oberon', 'version', 'was', 'theater', 'masterpiece', 'won', 'right', 'was', 'not', 'close', 'actual', 'book', 'Bronte', 'chopped', 'off', 'book', 'did', '1970', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'version', 'far', 'definitive', 'version', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'far', 'best.The', 'backdrop', 'Yorkshire', 'Moors', 'contrast', 'mansion', 'Thrushcross', 'Grange', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'well', 'portrayed', 'too.Robert', 'Cavanah', 'combination', 'anguish', 'pathos', 'obsession', 'Catherine', 'Earnshaw', 'Orla', 'Brady', 'demonic', 'malevolence', 'cruelty', 'towards', 'everyone', 'else', 'other.Ian', 'Bohnholm', 'Carter', 'character', 'toil', 'Edgar', 'Linton', 'was', 'intended', 'Bronte', 'not', 'merely', 'milksop', 'most', 'film', 'versions', 'have', 'portrayed', 'Flora', 'Montgomery', 'sympathetic', 'petulant', 'childish', 'Isabella', 'Linton', 'Ian', 'Shaw', 'expertly', 'descent', 'Hindley', 'master', 'Wuthering', 'heights', 'alcoholic', 'shell', 'man', 'brutalized', 'revenge', 'treatment', 'once', 'gave', 'Heathcliff.The', 'younger', 'set', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'Sarah', 'Smart', 'beautiful', 'Catherine', 'Linton', 'fire', 'mother', 'more', 'love', 'goodness', 'blond', 'curls', 'pretty', 'face', 'exactly', 'described', 'Bronte', 'see', 'character', 'when', 'up', 'Heathcliff', 'cruelty', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'rugged', 'rough', 'diamond', 'Hareton', 'Earnshaw', 'who', 'Hethcliff', 'ruin', 'end', 'Heathcliff', 'desperate', 'end', 'rejoining', 'beloved', 'Catherine', 'spirit', 'world', 'joining', 'two', 'lovers', 'Cathy', 'Linton', 'Hareton', 'plosive', 'hopeful', 'ending', 'Bronte', 'wrote', 'of.Linton', 'Heathcliff', 'played', 'William', 'Mannering', 'providing', 'self-pitying', 'sickness', 'Linton', 'not', 'display', 'maelvolence', 'character', 'Bronte', 'wrote', 'novel', '.My', 'main', 'quibble', 'movie', 'was', 'character', 'Nelly', 'Dean', 'who', 'was', 'Hindley', 'contemporary', 'book', 'not', 'elderly', 'woman', 'played', 'Polly', 'Hemingway.But', 'best', 'version', 'have', 'seen', 'recommended', 'one', 'teachers', 'novel', 'wanting', 'show', 'film', 'version', 'class']",N/A

One who has never read the novel may find the action moving too quickly, so that the flow of the movie may seem slightly abrupt or choppy.  However, the movie is only 2 hours long, which is probably why they had to cut out parts of the book and take some liberties with ages and certain details.  That does not detract too much from the enjoyment of this movie, which despite its choppiness, has excellent acting, beautiful cinematography (the landscapes are breathtaking), and a wonderfully wrought out, bitter plot which focuses on three generations of two families who are intimately interlocked with each other.

I thought it was too fast-paced and it had some terrible casting. Why were Heathcliff and Cathy, who looked to be at least in their thirties, runnning around the moors like little kids? They're not supposed to be grown up when they do that! They meet the Lintons when they're 12 years old! I've yet to see a version which actually portrays them as kids for that scene, but this one was the worst because they look so darn old! Cathy is supposed to be, what, 20 or so when she dies? Orla Brady was 37! Heathcliff was even older, which was fine for the later scenes but couldn't they have even tried to age him down with makeup??
