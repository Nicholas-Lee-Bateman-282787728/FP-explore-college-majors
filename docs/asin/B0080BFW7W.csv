1540534,A1NFIDCWNWRTM5,B0080BFW7W,"Ebony Blue ""Ebby""","[2, 2]","Disney did an excellent job writing and casting this modern day Cyrano de Bergerac story.  The music was surprisingly catchy and well performed.  Dawn Lewis as Cyrus' (Cyrano) mother trying to teach a group of teens ""Precious Lord"" was priceless.  Tyler James Williams as Cyrus was an effective awkward, nerdy teen with a major crush on Roxie (Roxxane)without having to don an oversized nose ala Cyrano. Enjoyed him in Everybody Hates Chris and see a promising career for this young man in acting (and/or maybe rap???).  Coco Jones...wow, such a powerful voice. What a pleasure to see ""smart"" rap again.As far as the Extended Version of the DVD, there is a scene cut from the TV version in which after Cyrano accidently spills a drink on rapper Bling's  shoes and Bling tells Cyrus that he is lucky the accident didn't happen while he was on stage or he would have embarrassed Cyrano with his rhymes, then Bling comes up with a weak diss of Cyrano that makes Blings crew or ""homies"" as Cyrano later raps laugh.  Cyrano responds that Bling's diss of him was lame and that his rap skills are modest at best and tells Bling that he could on the spot make up 5 better ways to diss himself. Blings crew becomes impressed with Cyrus' skills and at that point he announces to the crowd that the busboy wants to challenge him and of course if you have seen the TV version, Cyrus walks away from the challenge.My children loved this movie and I enjoyed it as well.  There were a few slow moments, but overall this was a great family movie.",5,Disney Lets it Shine,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1530,"['Disney', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'writing', 'casting', 'modern', 'day', 'Cyrano', 'Bergerac', 'story', 'music', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'catchy', 'well', 'performed', 'Dawn', 'Lewis', 'Cyrus', 'Cyrano', 'mother', 'trying', 'teach', 'group', 'teens', 'Precious', 'Lord', 'was', 'priceless', 'Tyler', 'James', 'Williams', 'Cyrus', 'was', 'effective', 'awkward', 'nerdy', 'teen', 'major', 'crush', 'Roxie', 'Roxxane', 'having', 'don', 'oversized', 'nose', 'ala', 'Cyrano', 'Enjoyed', 'Everybody', 'Hates', 'Chris', 'see', 'promising', 'career', 'young', 'man', 'acting', 'and/or', 'maybe', 'rap', 'Coco', 'Jones', 'wow', 'powerful', 'voice', 'What', 'pleasure', 'see', 'smart', 'rap', 'again.As', 'far', 'Extended', 'Version', 'DVD', 'scene', 'cut', 'TV', 'version', 'Cyrano', 'accidently', 'drink', 'rapper', 'Bling', 'shoes', 'Bling', 'tells', 'Cyrus', 'lucky', 'accident', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'was', 'stage', 'would', 'have', 'embarrassed', 'Cyrano', 'rhymes', 'then', 'Bling', 'up', 'weak', 'diss', 'Cyrano', 'Blings', 'crew', 'homies', 'Cyrano', 'later', 'laugh', 'Cyrano', 'Bling', 'diss', 'was', 'lame', 'rap', 'skills', 'are', 'modest', 'best', 'Bling', 'could', 'spot', 'make', 'up', '5', 'better', 'ways', 'diss', 'Blings', 'crew', 'becomes', 'impressed', 'Cyrus', 'skills', 'point', 'crowd', 'busboy', 'challenge', 'course', 'have', 'seen', 'TV', 'version', 'Cyrus', 'away', 'challenge.My', 'children', 'loved', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'few', 'slow', 'moments', 'was', 'great', 'family', 'movie']",Let It Shine

1540536,A22RZG1NQ0WAUX,B0080BFW7W,Katrina L. Burchett,"[7, 7]","Cyrus DeBarge (Tyler James Williams) is a young man who loves to write songs. He also has excellent freestyle rap skills, but lack of confidence is keeping him from performing in front of an audience. Cyrus' friend, Kris McDuffy (Trevor Jackson), has swagger, good looks, dancing talent and has no problem attracting girls, but he can't rap. Their childhood friend Roxie Andrews (Coco Jones) is now a teenage singing sensation and when they enter her contest, she thinks Cyrus' winning rhyme was written by Kris, and, because Cyrus shies away from the limelight, Kris takes his place.Cyrus and Kris had been friends since childhood. Cyrus was a true friend to Kris, but Kris had quite a bit to learn about loyalty. I liked both characters, but there was a scene in the club that left me disappointed in Cyrus: I was glad he had found the courage to speak up for himself, but he didn't have to do it in a way that disrespected his father. Later on in front of their house he spoke up for himself in a better way, a more respectful tone - it was a bit funny, actually, and the words his father spoke were very touching.Roxie was a likeable character. It was clear that she was insecure and it seemed to me that Lyla (Nicole Sullivan) was taking advantage,but maybe she believed she was making the right choices for Roxie. Roxie made a choice near the end of the movie I was very happy with. I expected a different reaction from her when she found out the `truth', though. But then again, if she hadn't responded the way she did, Cyrus would have missed out on an opportunity.Jacob DeBarge (Courtney B. Vance) was Cyrus' father and he was Pastor of Mount Bethel Baptist Church. I agreed with some of the things he said from the pulpit, but for the most part he used his sermons to chastise and condemn. This man of God learned valuable lessons, taught by his wife and son.Gail DeBarge (Dawnn Lewis): First Lady of Mount Bethel Baptist Church and a devoted wife and mother. She loves and respects her husband and she supports her son's choices. She is also the mediator when tension builds between father and son; I love the way she intervenes to keep the peace. I also loved the scene where she was directing the youth choir -she made me giggle.Da Bling (Brandon Mychal Smith): All I can say about this character is that he wasn't likeable.This is the first I've heard of Coco Jones, but I've seen Tyler James Williams in his lead role in Chris Rock's sitcom Everybody Hates Chris and an episode of A&E;'s The Cleaner, where I got to see how good he can be in a dramatic role. And I watch Syfy's Eureka - Trevor Jackson plays Kevin Blake. These young people are good performers.This Disney film got my attention from the beginning and kept me smiling until the end. It sends positive messages about staying true to yourself, friendship, conquering fears, how it's not good to judge by appearances, and forgiveness.  The acting is good and I liked the different types of music - contemporary gospel (loved watching the youth choir perform), hip-hop, gospel rap and I really enjoyed the rap battles. It's good family entertainment. I loved it!*Do not copy/paste my review without permission.

The friendship between Kris and Cyrus was outstanding. When it counted each one was willing to do whatever it took to save the friendship. The father the Reverend had some valid points, but misused his pulpit to drive them to his young people. Instead of having a dialog with them, he threw scriptures at them. That is the very reason our young people are MIA today. Mom played a very vital roll, she kept her son encouraged while trying to get her husband to see the error of his ways.

Cyrus (Tyler James Williams) is shy and has self esteem issues brought about by a domineering preacher father. He sneaks out at night to bus tables at the forbidden rap club while he composes music for his friend Kris (Trevor Jackson) to sing. They hook up with Roxy (Coco Jones) an old elementary school friend who loves their music, but doesn't realize Cyrus is the brains of &#34;Truth.&#34; She is a famous singer.The music was good and the rap insults were light, nothing to shame the Disney logo. The film has its predictable heart warming ending. I enjoyed the criticism of the use of the voice enhancers, but the movie stops short of claiming Katie Perry is nothing more than an overpaid karaoke singer.Criticism: It appears Cyrus ironically lip synced his rapping and singing parts. Also if you noticed the &#34;church&#34; never has a cross or mentions Jesus. It has some out of focus Bible quotes in the background on the wall and mentions G-O-D, but never Jesus, even in song.
