But the one on sharks covers more than just the sharks which is why it came out ahead of the other two.  I bought it for 3D effects and bit disappointed in that.  Especially the disk on Whales which just did not come across well in 3D but that may have as much to do with subject as the photography.  Some 3D scenes are ok but overall not that great.

We have always loved Jacques Cousteau's work, but these documentaries were repetitive and extremely boring. The same shots were shown over and over, and in some cases you watched the same footage for like 5 minutes while the narrator gave common facts about behaviors that they never showed. We love 3D but BOTH of us fell asleep a couple of times while trying to watch the series. We watched 2 out of 3 of these DVDs and haven't been able to bring ourselves to watch the 3rd.
