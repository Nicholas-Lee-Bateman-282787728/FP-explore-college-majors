988274,ARXLHOKV7FKU4,B000FDECH4,Gina Rose St John,"[11, 12]","John Hannah is one of the most talented, naturally gifted actors working today. This series was compulsive for me.  I had to see every epidsode after Rebus, with Hannah, ran out. Somehow, the Brits always get into the characters so well..why is that? Could it be the casting is perfect? Hannah,as Dr. Iain McCallum,  carries the series, is a devil with women, and everyone in the show does an amazing job. Where do these actors come from? I recognized only Hannah. The women have such a different,natural beauty, and none of the men could pose for underwear ads. Yes, they play compelling characters and are somehow much more interesting for looking like regular folk. The writing is superb; so much better than even the best shows on American t.v. With each episode, I could not take my eyes away from the screen because I had to know what McCallum was going to do and how he was going to get thru another big mess because often. motorcycle- riding McCallum is his own worst enemy. His personal life becomes as intriguing as who is raising the body count; and what is obvious, is that the writer of the series knows medicine and science well, so that the viewer is learning in every scene. This is not glamorous London; it's the seedy side of the East End of London and is as deadly and dark as Edinburg,Scotland in the Rebus series.  Don't miss McCallum if you like an intelligent and entertaining experience.

Of course it was a precursor to CSI - but better, because McCallum is so natural, so real, and the actors are stupendous.  However, I suggest getting the series at the library and skipping the last one.  It's a total bore - McCallum (John Hannah) is gone, along with the exquisite Angela (Zara Turner) and everyone from the start of the series looks weary. The actors basically phone in their performances and the new people have no charisma whatsoever.  Either that, or the writing of this one episode is just really, really bad.  My favorite scene from the entire series is in the next-to-last episode, between Bracken (Gerald Murphy) the thorny police investigator, and his awkward young assistant.  They have begun bickering like an old married couple by this time; the kid is beginning to get really good at his job and Bracken is suddenly threatened.  You have to see it to get it.

ANGRY RANT WARNING TOO.....If you buy this and love it as you go along, perhaps you should avoid the final episode.This was an incredible, wonderful forensic drama, full of mystery and crime, great stories and characters and actors and really worth watching.  They biolt characters really well from the beginning, they had a good balance betweent the science, the police work, the personal relationships, and the workplace relationships. Good mysteries with twists and turns but not so much it gives you whip lash, just enough for you to get it wrong sometimes and get it right sometimes.... however....sadly, it might as well have been made in the USA because the one thing I DESPISE about my great country's television series' is that some idiot at some network decides one night the series is over and instead of wrapping it up in a worthwhile way that pleases the fans and gives you a few episodes to adapt and be pleased some sort of ""end"", they just cut it off abruptly or pathetically wrap it up in a hasty, horrible, senseless way that angers everyone who has any investment in the series.In the last 3 episodes they destroyed McCallum's relationships with every friend and co-worker he had, then destroyed Paddy's character worse than being a SYOA political jerk - he was an actual bad guy who hates McCallum and deliberately tries to destroy him after he (paddy) sleeps with a young student and gets her pregnant and then justifies it with ""if its offered you take it"" and doesn't care a bit that she was murdered carrying his baby, not a single comment about his baby being killed, and then they destroyed the entire show with the last episode as I describe in my rant below.They took a page out of the USA tv network playbook, and it was one of the top 5 worst pages, only worse. Its not just a pathetic last episode- Its like they fired the creators and writers (and actors), brought in a bunch of people nobody knows, doesn't even give you an episode or 2 to KNOW the characters - they just swooped in for the final episode with new people and no reason for where the main characters went or why, and gives you a ridiculous episode that is all around stupid, poorly written, confusing and pointless-not even a decent mystery in the final episode! The few characters who returned for the final episode were insulted and ruined through the whole episode.  They couldn't even give us the typical Fuzzy or Bobby charm or Paddy's SYOA attitude, they were just background people who were treated like garbage, with no personality traits from their former characters whatsoever. Its like the cops didn't even know who they were - they were ignored by the other ""regulars"" and dissed by the new ""stars"" at every turn - I was disgusted. The cops didn't even work on the case, they were just extras with a few lines - Freakin bizarre!I usually analyze through the whole episode ""who could it be?""  and within the 1st 20-30 minutes, there are multiple credible possibilities. Since there was no background or characters or story to latch onto, ""who dunnit"" was not anywhere near the questions I was asking myself - ""who are these people"" was the question, and it made it seem like it had to be one of the new characters, except that the 2nd to last episode already made ""McCallum's replacement"" a killer so why would they be going down the same road?  Yet, the new ""McCallum"" aka Gallagher was so unlikeable, it seemed like he was involved - until his new ""angela"" arrived and then it seemed she was involved because she didn't have a single redeeming character trait. OR was it Gallagher's new girlfriend who he met on the day of the first murder?  Since she was a mystery woman who was looking up Gallagher's forensic experience online and checking out his serial killer books, it seemed like her but it made no sense because she kept getting attacked by the killers but never actually killed.  Positively STUPID!!! meanwhile, the cops investigated NOBODY!!!!!Who it turned out to be and why was even more ridiculous because they weren't even introduced to the story until about 5 minutes before they were found out to be the killers.  And some of the murders happened at the mortuary by people who didn't have access to the mortuary (what happened to the usually electronic security box that required a code in the previous episode?, how about the keys that only were available to the top 5 characters in the show and in the previous episode had to be secretly copied for the new ""McCallum/killer"" to have access?) And then the 1st murder that was thought to be committed in the morgue was not - it was viles of blood splashed to look like a murder scene, and then cleaned up only to be seen with a blue light, but no murder committed there - WHAT? but then the killers tried to kill Gallagher there - obviously getting into the building YET AGAIN without any security knowledge.  Sure, they made the security guards out to be completely incompetent in one scene to make sure you knew they were idiots but still - NO electronic box, no keys required, never showed them getting into the morgue....just being there and security not seeing them or seeing them and not wondering how they got in  - in previous episodes, there was no emphasis on guards - all the security was high tech and keys but suddenly its careless irresponsible guards and some old video cameras that don't work right - ever.NO McCallum in the final episode HELLOOOOOOOOO? No Angela HELLOOOOOOOOOOO? Yes, we get the fabulous Fuzzy and Bobby but they both had their personalities removed and were turned into extras - not glorified extras, EXTRAS!  A few scenes with Paddy being angry and drunk but he was not part of the episode, his secretary who I don't ever remember being in any other episode (no offense if she was, but I have no recollection of her) and the usual cops, but they were extras too - since they didn't know the new stars of the show yet and didn't work on the case, they were worthless extras - even the offices/mortuary looks different, they used all different angles than before making it look like a different set with different actors and different characters and a completely implausible story that is all about the new main character who we don't know and don't give a hoot about.  ONE SENTENCE about Mccallum being ""head hunted"" and moving to California or something, and no comments at all about Angela - both of which had finally come to terms with their feelings for eachother in the previous episode, and seemingly rescinding their resignations (although that wasn't actually said, it was implied) - and then POOF, they are both GONE, and nobody says where for sure and definitely didn't say they were together or had another fallout or anything - just GONE. This usually doesn't happen in UK mystery shows because they have a beginning and an end. Possibly the worst writing I have ever witnessed in a series.I really enjoy USA made mystery/crime shows but the other countries have some differences that make them really good in their own way, one is that they always END a SHOW. Not here, they just added a final episode that could have been a completely different show with writers who just came out of some high school writing program who created their own characters who had no connection to eachother whatsoever.  I'd rather have had the typical USA ""I got cancelled without any notice"" drop off episode than this garbage. What a waste to end such a great show with an episode that is so bad it actually makes me angry.  I wonder if fans at the time were as angry as I am after watching the dvd set and getting invested in the characters etc.As I said at the beginning, if you enjoy the show all the way through, stop at disc 4 and don't watch the final episode on disc 5 unless you are watching out of curiosity about how bad it could really be.5 star show with a ZERO STAR ENDING. I would be embarrassed if I played any part in the final episode of this show.",4,"Excellent series, Worthless ending...they should be embarrassed",1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,8030,"['SPOILER',

988291,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000FDECH4,Stephanie De Pue,"[70, 72]","As it appeared on broadcast television, at least, episodes of this series opened on a dark, moody and threatening looking Thames River flowing through London, under the famous bridges, while a sultry chick singer delivered ""Cry Me a River.""  Now recently released on dvd, scuttlebutt says this production of Scottish Television Enterprises has lost the voice-over opening song.  Licensing difficulties, I suppose.  But this is a blow to me, and, perhaps to others: the English singer Mari Wilson's take of this famous song put me right in the mood for what followed.At any rate, hunky Scottish actor John Hannah, whom I first noticed in an episode of Taggart,came to widespread public notice playing ""Matthew""in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" Here he plays Dr. Ian Mc Callum, forensic pathologist based at St. Patricks Hospital in London's East End.  The darkness of the Thames continues into the hospital, which always looks so dark and dusty, I wonder how the pathologists can see anything through their microscopes. As befits a Scot, Hannah's character, McCallum is painted in dark, morose tones too.  At one point he and a friend take a stroll through London: it seems that, at almost every street, there has been a murder, and he has examined a body, and it is  obvious that he carries all those violent deaths, and all those bodies, as a burden all his waking, and sleeping hours.  Hannah, who was born to a large family in East Kilbride, Scotland, and began his working career as an electrician's apprentice, evidently has a gift for these dark law enforcement roles.  He played Rebus in several made for tv episodes of the Ian Rankin books, until a corporate reorganization resulted in his replacement by another actor.At any rate, Mc Callum's  plots, too, are dark, but taut and spare: this is a well-written series. I call to mind an episode about a Jewish family that owns a bakery, and a really resonant one about illegal Brazilian immigrants being exposed to a mysterious fatal illness by the unlicensed English doctor they must consult for their medical needs.  There's an excellent one in which a female coworker of McCallum's is murdered shortly after they've made love: he's in an uncomfortable, untenable position: doesn't want to admit he was the last to see her alive, but unable to prevent the investigation  from going forward and snaring him at last.  And there's a dandy one about a man who believes Mc Callum has injured him, trying to take revenge.There's some of that Scottish wit too, of course. Guess you'd have to conclude that this television series fits into that school of British mysteries now known as tartan noir: darker, more violent, more bloody than the norm.  But with some humor, too.  At one point, McCallum, talking to a woman he's about to get to know better says, ""Please, I'm Scottish.  We don't even make eye contact until after we've had sex."" Of course, there is sex, Hannah/Mc Callum is much too easy on the eyes to be going without, and almost every episode features a shot of Hannah's tasty tousch.  Another good reason to check this series out.",5,A Darker Shade of London,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,3097,"['appeared', 'broadcast', 'television', 'least', 'episodes', 'series', 'opened', 'dark', 'moody', 'threatening', 'looking', 'Thames', 'River', 'flowing', 'London', 'famous', 'bridges', 'sultry', 'chick', 'singer', 'delivered', 'Cry', 'Me', 'River', 'Now', 'recently', 'released', 'dvd', 'scuttlebutt', 'production', 'Scottish', 'Television', 'Enterprises', 'lost', 'voice-over', 'opening', 'song', 'Licensing', 'difficulties', 'suppose', 'blow', 'perhaps', 'others', 'English', 'singer', 'Mari', 'Wilson', 'take', 'famous', 'song', 'put', 'right', 'mood', 'what', 'rate', 'hunky', 'Scottish', 'actor', 'John', 'Hannah', 'whom', 'first', 'noticed', 'episode', 'Taggart', 'came', 'widespread', 'public', 'notice', 'playing', 'Matthew', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Here', 'Dr.', 'Ian', 'Mc', 'Callum', 'forensic', 'pathologist', 'based', 'St.', 'Patricks', 'Hospital', 'London', 'East', 'End', 'darkness', 'Thames', 'hospital', 'always', 'so', 'dark', 'dusty', 'wonder', 'how', 'pathologists', 'can', 'see', 'anything', 'microscopes', 'befits', 'Scot', 'Hannah', 'character', 'McCallum', 'painted', 'dark', 'morose', 'tones', 'too', 'one', 'point', 'friend', 'take', 'stroll', 'London', 'almost', 'street', 'been', 'murder', 'examined', 'body', 'obvious', 'violent', 'deaths', 'bodies', 'burden', 'waking', 'sleeping', 'hours', 'Hannah', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'large', 'family', 'East', 'Kilbride', 'Scotland', 'began', 'working', 'career', 'electrician', 'apprentice', 'evidently', 'gift', 'dark', 'law', 'enforcement', 'roles', 'played', 'Rebus', 'several', 'made', 'tv', 'episodes', 'Ian', 'Rankin', 'books', 'corporate', 'reorganization', 'resulted', 'replacement', 'actor.At', 'rate', 'Mc', 'Callum', 'plots', 'too', 'are', 'dark', 'taut', 'spare', 'well-written', 'series', 'call', 'mind', 'episode', 'Jewish', 'family', 'bakery', 'really', 'resonant', 'one', 'illegal', 'Brazilian', 'immigrants', 'being', 'exposed', 'mysterious', 'fatal', 'illness', 'unlicensed', 'English', 'doctor', 'must', 'consult', 'medical', 'needs', 'excellent', 'one', 'female', 'coworker', 'McCallum', 'murdered', 'shortly', ""'ve"", 'made', 'love', 'uncomfortable', 'untenable', 'position', ""n't"", 'want', 'admit', 'was', 'last', 'see', 'alive', 'unable', 'prevent', 'investigation', 'going', 'forward', 'snaring', 'last', 'dandy', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'Mc', 'Callum', 'injured', 'trying', 'take', 'revenge.There', 'Scottish', 'wit', 'too', 'course', 'Guess', ""'d"", 'have', 'conclude', 'television', 'series', 'school', 'British', 'mysteries', 'now', 'known', 'tartan', 'noir', 'darker', 'more', 'violent', 'more', 'bloody', 'norm', 'humor', 'too', 'one', 'point', 'McCallum', 'talking', 'woman', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'Please', ""'m"", 'Scottish', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'eye', 'contact', ""'ve"", 'had', 'sex', 'course', 'sex', 'Hannah/Mc', 'Callum', 'much', 'too', 'easy', 'eyes', 'be', 'going', 'almost', 'episode', 'shot', 'Hannah', 'tasty', 'tousch', 'good', 'reason', 'check', 'series', 'out']",McCallum: The Complete Series
