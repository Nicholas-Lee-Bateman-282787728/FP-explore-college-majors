There are those that lack giant robots, magical powers and epic destinies and instead follow the lives of average people moving from day to day.Ramen Fighter Miki accomplishes this, in spite of itself.The basis of the story is Miki the Ramen Stand Girl, a twenty year old who passes her days as a waitress for her mother's restaurant with the odd delivery here and there. However, the rest of the cast tend to make things more epic than they are in real life through the usage of random martial arts duels that range from Train-inspired finishing moves to vicious attack dogs. Yet, despite all of these random attacks and violence, this show never gets beyond the fact that these people basically have simple lives and have normal day to day problems despite their best efforts.Honestly? This show is pure, cheap crack that has no point and really doesn't try to. The opening sound track is the most epic element to the whole production and is more ironic than anything. I enjoyed it because it amused me, but don't go into this expecting something mind blowing or ground breaking. This is just the sort of Anime that is silly enough for a drinking game without having a plot that the consumption of alcohol will make things harder to understand. So if that doesn't matter to you, go ahead and pick up the silly crack and enjoy!HINT of a SPOILERThe main character herself is much more entertaining when inebriated. :)",4,A slice of life with attitude!,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,1472,"['anime', 'are', 'not', 'designed', 'be', 'particularly', 'heroic', 'are', 'lack', 'giant', 'robots', 'magical', 'powers', 'epic', 'destinies', 'instead', 'follow', 'lives', 'average', 'people', 'moving', 'day', 'day.Ramen', 'Fighter', 'Miki', 'spite', 'itself.The', 'basis', 'story', 'Miki', 'Ramen', 'Stand', 'Girl', 'twenty', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'days', 'waitress', 'mother', 'restaurant', 'odd', 'delivery', 'here', 'there', 'However', 'rest', 'cast', 'tend', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'epic', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'usage', 'random', 'martial', 'arts', 'duels', 'range', 'Train-inspired', 'finishing', 'moves', 'vicious', 'attack', 'dogs', 'random', 'attacks', 'violence', 'show', 'never', 'fact', 'people', 'basically', 'have', 'simple', 'lives', 'have', 'normal', 'day', 'day', 'problems', 'best', 'efforts.Honestly', 'show', 'pure', 'cheap', 'crack', 'point', 'really', ""n't"", 'try', 'opening', 'sound', 'track', 'most', 'epic', 'element', 'whole', 'production', 'more', 'ironic', 'anything', 'enjoyed', 'amused', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'something', 'mind', 'blowing', 'ground', 'breaking', 'just', 'sort', 'Anime', 'silly', 'enough', 'drinking', 'game', 'having', 'plot', 'consumption', 'alcohol', 'will', 'make', 'things', 'harder', 'understand', 'So', ""n't"", 'matter', 'go', 'ahead', 'pick', 'up', 'silly', 'crack', 'enjoy', 'HINT', 'SPOILERThe', 'main', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'when', 'inebriated']",Ramen Fighter Miki: The Complete Collection

1187199,AFV2584U13XP3,B001F0TT42,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 1]","I saw a few episodes on Hulu and knew immediately that I had to get this fantastic series for my collection.  The Series follows mainly on the character of Miki Onimaru daughter of Ramen restaurant owner Makiko Onimaru and while Miki may be a little absentminded and somewhat clumsy she more than makes up for it with her fighting abilities and attitude and the only one able to put her in her place is her mother.  Also in the series you'll see her arch-rival Megumi Kannazuki who was bullied by Miki in school and owns the bakery across the street and who Miki sees as a competitor for customers, and than you have Kankuro Nishiyama self imposed rival to Miki as well since he was also bullied by Miki even though she is younger than he is,  for the last character you have Akihiko Ohta another store owner on the street but is actually a friend to both Miki and her mother but who also enjoys watching the fights Miki gets into as well as seeing her mother give out Miki's punishment.  The series is light-hearted similar to Ranma1/2 so don't worry about anything to dramatic or serious and the series.  The set is only subbed which I found to be alright but to people who don't like having to read the subtitles than you'll have to pass this over since the Japanese audio is all you're going to get with this complete set, and the video is clear and sharp so no problems with that.  So if you like funny animes or fighting animes either way this set is a good choice for you...",5,An Entertaining Fight Filled Funny Anime Of The Most Tomboyish Psycho Ramen Firl You'll Ever See,1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,1481,"['saw', 'few', 'episodes', 'Hulu', 'knew', 'immediately', 'had', 'get', 'fantastic', 'series', 'collection', 'Series', 'mainly', 'character', 'Miki', 'Onimaru', 'daughter', 'Ramen', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Makiko', 'Onimaru', 'Miki', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'absentminded', 'somewhat', 'clumsy', 'more', 'up', 'fighting', 'abilities', 'attitude', 'only', 'one', 'able', 'put', 'place', 'mother', 'Also', 'series', ""'ll"", 'see', 'arch-rival', 'Megumi', 'Kannazuki', 'who', 'was', 'bullied', 'Miki', 'school', 'bakery', 'street', 'who', 'Miki', 'competitor', 'customers', 'have', 'Kankuro', 'Nishiyama', 'imposed', 'rival', 'Miki', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'also', 'bullied', 'Miki', 'even', 'younger', 'last', 'character', 'have', 'Akihiko', 'Ohta', 'store', 'owner', 'street', 'actually', 'friend', 'Miki', 'mother', 'who', 'also', 'watching', 'fights', 'Miki', 'as', 'well', 'seeing', 'mother', 'give', 'out', 'Miki', 'punishment', 'series', 'light-hearted', 'similar', 'Ranma1/2', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'about', 'anything', 'dramatic', 'serious', 'series', 'set', 'only', 'subbed', 'found', 'be', 'alright', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'having', 'read', 'subtitles', ""'ll"", 'have', 'pass', 'over', 'Japanese', 'audio', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'complete', 'set', 'video', 'clear', 'sharp', 'so', 'no', 'problems', 'So', 'like', 'funny', 'animes', 'fighting', 'animes', 'way', 'set', 'good', 'choice']",Ramen Fighter Miki: The Complete Collection

While definitely cartoony with absolutely no direction, its totally hilarious!! I laughed out loud almost every episode!!

Its silly action, but there is always something goin on!! Always!

1187201,AV1WAYOHXD1MA,B001F0TT42,"The Pes ""Deerhoads""","[3, 3]","This show revolves around the zany antics of a ramen shop and its poster girl,  Miki.  In a way this is the show in a  nutshell.  It's a show about nothing.  If you liked other shows of this kind like School Rumble, you'll like Ramen Fighter.  It never takes itself seriously, and in fact it works better in some ways than School Rumble because of the total lack of a romantic angle.  No messy drama to bog down the comedy.  This is all strictly fun and games.This might be a downer for some.  However, the fact that you don't have to really keep up with any pretext is really what drives the show.  It's just a show that puts it's protagonists in some oddball situations.The main role falls on Miki, a young exuberant poster girl from a ramen shop her mom  owns.  Miki does most of the menial jobs  around the restaurant, something she just can't seem to finish on her own.  Her problem being that she tends to wonder off, usually into some random trouble, causing some disastrous effects on her tasks.  It doesn't help either that she tends to pick-up fights at random, and in fact, most people comment on her propensity to be a bully, especially to those around her.It doesn't help that other people get in her way.  There is Megumi, an opposing poster girl from a bakery across the street.  Toshiyuki, a menacing dog that seems to be the only living thing that can stand up to Miki.  Nishiyama, a man trying to get revenge for the awful things that Miki did to him in his youth.  Her mom, Makiko, and the one person Miki truly fears.  Then there is Ohta, a neighboring shop owner that loves the TV series Star Ranger (think Power Rangers and you get the idea).The story isn't too complicated and it works more as a formula to get these characters in a comedic situation.  It works, and it works wonderfully.  The show is 12 episodes long, and it comes in a subtitled format.  No English audio, so if this is a deal breaker I would recommend skipping this one.  Even though there is no English dub, the Japanese cast is spot on.  It's just funny hearing the characters scream and cry at any little situation that they find themselves in.  Even funnier are the facial expressions and the big drops of sweat that appear.  Somehow, every comedic element is spot on.  It's really just a funny show.It's short lived, but what we do get is just a sweet selection of stories to enjoy.  You'll be hard pressed to find a short series of this nature at this price.  It won't be for everyone, but to those that appreciate dumb humor, this is right up your alley.Good purchase!",5,A Fun Show About Nothing,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,2568,"['show', 'zany', 'antics', 'ramen', 'shop', 'poster', 'girl', 'Miki', 'way', 'show', 'nutshell', 'show', 'nothing', 'liked', 'other', 'shows', 'kind', 'School', 'Rumble', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Ramen', 'Fighter', 'never', 'seriously', 'fact', 'better', 'ways', 'School', 'Rumble', 'total', 'lack', 'romantic', 'angle', 'messy', 'drama', 'bog', 'down', 'comedy', 'strictly', 'fun', 'games.This', 'might', 'be', 'downer', 'However', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'really', 'keep', 'up', 'pretext', 'really', 'what', 'show', 'just', 'show', 'protagonists', 'oddball', 'situations.The', 'main', 'role', 'Miki', 'young', 'exuberant', 'poster', 'girl', 'ramen', 'shop', 'mom', 'Miki', 'most', 'menial', 'jobs', 'restaurant', 'something', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'finish', 'own', 'problem', 'being', 'wonder', 'off', 'usually', 'random', 'trouble', 'causing', 'disastrous', 'effects', 'tasks', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'pick-up', 'fights', 'random', 'fact', 'most', 'people', 'comment', 'propensity', 'be', 'bully', 'especially', 'her.It', ""n't"", 'help', 'other', 'people', 'get', 'way', 'Megumi', 'opposing', 'poster', 'girl', 'bakery', 'street', 'Toshiyuki', 'menacing', 'dog', 'be', 'only', 'living', 'thing', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'Miki', 'Nishiyama', 'man', 'trying', 'get', 'revenge', 'awful', 'things', 'Miki', 'did', 'youth', 'mom', 'Makiko', 'one', 'person', 'Miki', 'truly', 'fears', 'Then', 'Ohta', 'neighboring', 'shop', 'owner', 'TV', 'series', 'Star', 'Ranger', 'think', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'get', 'idea', '.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'too', 'complicated', 'more', 'formula', 'get', 'characters', 'comedic', 'situation', 'wonderfully', 'show', '12', 'episodes', 'long', 'subtitled', 'format', 'English', 'audio', 'so', 'deal', 'breaker', 'would', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'one', 'Even', 'English', 'dub', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'spot', 'just', 'funny', 'hearing', 'characters', 'scream', 'cry', 'little', 'situation', 'find', 'Even', 'funnier', 'are', 'facial', 'expressions', 'big', 'drops', 'sweat', 'appear', 'Somehow', 'comedic', 'element', 'spot', 'really', 'just', 'funny', 'show.It', 'short', 'lived', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'just', 'sweet', 'selection', 'stories', 'enjoy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'short', 'series', 'nature', 'price', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'appreciate', 'dumb', 'humor', 'right', 'alley.Good', 'purchase']",Ramen Fighter Miki: The Complete Collection

Some of the things I mention may contain spoilers so read no further if that is a problem.The story is about a young woman named Miki, she works in her mother's ramen shop as a waitress and delivery girl. She is also a brute of a person. If she can get through one day without beating a person into submission, screwing up a delivery or spilling a customers order at the shop, it is a good day. The story is mainly about her almost mystical martial arts ability and all her challengers or restaurant competitors trying daily to beat her in some kind of fight, failing hilariously in the process. Throughout the entire show there is only one person who can best her in a fight and that is her mom. If random comic violence is your thing then this show is for you. Unlike a lot of more recent shows with comic viloence, this one does not cater to 'fan service'. There are no ridiculous upskirt shots or random topless women to be found here.
