807349,A1OEYPETQ24X4O,B0001I56CS,"Linda Huntington ""Lives for music""","[3, 3]","Want to view a very enjoyable movie to make you warm all over and laugh then Alabmam Love Story is the movie. I thought Mark Collie and Coley McCabe's performance was just fantastic. A story that some of us wish were ours. Roper was not a kidnapper in his heart but circumstances left him few choices, so he thought until Goodie showed him what was really in his heart (His love for her).  He also showed her that she could have the warm love she wanted from a gentle hearted man. All they had to do was reach out for it and not settle for what was. I would like to have seen a soundtract or at least recordings of the music as I thought that it was super country music. And the fact Mark Collie and Coley McCabe wrote and performed these songs made it so enjoyable. I have watched it several times and plan to watch it a lot more.  I recommend it very highly.",5,Alabama Love Story,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,860,"['Want', 'view', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'make', 'warm', 'laugh', 'then', 'Alabmam', 'Love', 'Story', 'movie', 'thought', 'Mark', 'Collie', 'Coley', 'McCabe', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'fantastic', 'story', 'were', 'ours', 'Roper', 'was', 'not', 'kidnapper', 'heart', 'circumstances', 'left', 'few', 'choices', 'thought', 'Goodie', 'showed', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'heart', 'love', 'also', 'showed', 'could', 'have', 'warm', 'love', 'wanted', 'gentle', 'hearted', 'man', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'reach', 'out', 'not', 'settle', 'what', 'was', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'soundtract', 'least', 'recordings', 'music', 'thought', 'was', 'super', 'country', 'music', 'fact', 'Mark', 'Collie', 'Coley', 'McCabe', 'wrote', 'performed', 'songs', 'made', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'plan', 'watch', 'lot', 'more', 'recommend', 'very', 'highly']",N/A

Actually, all of the actors in this film could benefit from some acting lessons.  Coley McCabe has a beautiful singing voice and I'm not sure why she's never made it on the country music scene, but she endears herself to the viewer and ultimately plays the kind of character everyone would love to have for a friend. I give this story a 4 star rating based on the storyline.  It's a very sweet, feel good kind of movie with a little bit of humor thrown in.  This balances out the lack of acting ability.  It's a movie that I've enjoyed viewing several times.",4,Sweet Movie,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,665,"['Mark', 'Collie', 'favorite', 'country', 'singer', 'time', 'when', 'acting', 'bit', 'short', 'Actually', 'actors', 'film', 'could', 'benefit', 'acting', 'lessons', 'Coley', 'McCabe', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'voice', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'never', 'made', 'country', 'music', 'scene', 'viewer', 'ultimately', 'kind', 'character', 'everyone', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'friend', 'give', 'story', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'based', 'storyline', 'very', 'sweet', 'feel', 'good', 'kind', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'humor', 'thrown', 'out', 'lack', 'acting', 'ability', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'viewing', 'several', 'times']",N/A
