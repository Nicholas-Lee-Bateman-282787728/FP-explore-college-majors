The lead prosecutor is an Army officer.  He is interested in showing Naval negligence in not adequately preventing the attack.  He is convinced from his sources that the planes flew off the Hornet, but needs a direct confession.  He even bugs the jail cell, which the men discover.  As one of the men points out, if they came from Russian bases, this is political dynamite, and they will have to reinforce the frontier.  If they came from China, the Army is at fault, and China will have to be completely overrun.  If they came from the sea, the Navy is at fault, and more resources will have to be used to cordon off the home islands.  The prosecutor tries one last gamble by offering a deal, which the men turn down, and he commits suicide to atone for his public failure.  Even as a generalization based on actual events, this film has some post-war interest.",4,An interesting political subplot as well,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,971,"['What', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'versus', 'Navy', 'lead', 'prosecutor', 'Army', 'officer', 'interested', 'showing', 'Naval', 'negligence', 'not', 'adequately', 'preventing', 'attack', 'convinced', 'sources', 'planes', 'flew', 'Hornet', 'direct', 'confession', 'even', 'bugs', 'jail', 'cell', 'men', 'discover', 'one', 'men', 'points', 'out', 'came', 'Russian', 'bases', 'political', 'dynamite', 'will', 'have', 'reinforce', 'frontier', 'came', 'China', 'Army', 'fault', 'China', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'completely', 'overrun', 'came', 'sea', 'Navy', 'fault', 'more', 'resources', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'used', 'cordon', 'off', 'home', 'islands', 'prosecutor', 'one', 'last', 'gamble', 'offering', 'deal', 'men', 'turn', 'down', 'suicide', 'atone', 'public', 'failure', 'Even', 'generalization', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'film', 'post-war', 'interest']",N/A

260923,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,630166275X,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This is a war-time propaganda movie and therefore it has its flaws - but it is better than most such films. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.""Purple Heart"" is inspired by true events, namely the ""Doolittle Raid"" and its aftermath. On 18 April 1942 sixteen USAAF bombers took off from USS ""Hornet"" and bombed targets in various Japanese towns, including Tokyo. Unable to return to the carrier, those planes continued to China, in hope that they will manage to reach air bases still held by allied Chinese Kuomintang government. Fifteen managed to reach China (one landed in then neutral Soviet Union), but unable to find any safe place to land their crews had to abandon or crash land them.Most crew members survived and reached allied lines, but three were killed - and eight were captured by the Japanese forces, which in this time occupied most of China. Once brought to Japan, those eight men were subjected to a ""trial"" for ""war crimes"" - and also tortured in order to give information about the raid and especially their point of departure. This film tells the story of those eight men. I will not say here what happened to them in the real life and if you want to watch this film, I would advise you to abstain from looking for answers on internet. This film can be enjoyed much more when we are still not aware of the results of the whole ""trial""...Now, this film was made in 1944, during war and therefore not only its purpose was war-time propaganda, but also most facts about the ordeal and fate of those eight men were unknown. Therefore, the scenario was based on some fragmentary information the Japanese made public already during war, but all missing pieces had to be replaced with ""licentia poetica"".There is no question that this film has some flaws which damaged it. Some Japanese are shown as total caricatures and there are also two scenes (in both of which somebody dies in the middle of the trial) which are so abysmally, embarrassingly stupid that watching them is an ordeal... Thanks God, those two scenes are short - but still long enough to make me take off one star from the rating.With the exception of those two elements, I found this film good, certainly better than many other Hollywood war time morale builders. Director Lewis Milestone had a very good idea to make one of American soldiers say at the very beginning of the film: ""This is a lynching"". That determines immediately the atmosphere of the film, which is serious and dark, because from the first minutes we know that those guys stand no chance of saving their necks - and therefore for them the question is not ""Are we going to die?"" but ""How can we die with our heads high?"".This dark and emotional atmosphere is build up even further with the excellent use of the prison cell in which those airmen are being held, which has no walls, but is a central block of iron bars going from the floor to the ceiling, surrounded by a walking corridor on all sides. In totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, which don't have to worry about human rights, this kind of cell is quite a practical thing when holding for extended periods prisoners of special importance, because it completely deprives them of any privacy - it doesn't offer any hiding places and also, having no dead angles, it allows the permanent all-azimuth monitoring of inmates. In this film the choice of the director to place the eight Americans in such a place rises the emotions very high, because this thing looks exactly like a SLAUGHTER PEN - and of course, it is one, of sorts...As I already said, this film has some flaws, but NOT when describing the reflections and sufferings of those eight ""walking dead"" men - actually, it does a good job in that aspect. It is very hard to await death, powerless and trapped in a cage, surrounded by mortal enemies, very far from home, when being almost able to hear your murderers sharpening their knives... Such a thing is hard, when you are barely 19... Such a thing is also hard, when you are a young husband and father, realizing that those couple of years of common life is everything that you will ever have and that you will not only never see your grandchildren but you will be denied even seeing your kid losing his first baby tooth... In fact, such a thing is hard at any age and in any circumstances.However, the realization that death is unavoidable and very near, helps also (once the first shock passed) to develop coping mechanisms - therefore, given a little time, many people will ultimately find ways to spend their last moments in this world in peace and with at least some dignity preserved. Not willing to allow that, both during the real ""trial"" and in this film, the Japanese gaolers introduced an extra element of incertitude and this most cruel of all things - a little bit of hope... I will not exactly say how, but those American airmen, the real ones and the fictitious ones in this film, were offered a possibility to save their lives, but at a very high price - by surrendering completely their honour and helping greatly the enemies of their country, in a VERY public way... This cruel game the Japanese played with their prisoners is also well shown - very well indeed.The efforts of a lonely Swiss Red Cross representative are just an episode of the film, but they are shown in a realistic and moving way. Indeed, that man, horribly despised and routinely humiliated by the Japanese, played a role even greater than anybody, he included, could imagine at that moment... Even more important are foreign press correspondents assisting to the ""trial"" and their presence is actually a real thing - it was indeed by their (heavily censured) descriptions of the events that Americans had the first insight in the fate of their prisoners... The film shows very well the distinction in treatment by the Japanese of those correspondents who come from their co-belligerent allies (III Reich and Bulgaria) or from neutral countries perceived as sympathetic to Axis (Argentina) and those who came from neutral countries perceived as unfriendly (Soviet Union, which in 1942 was NOT at war with Japan and Portugal).This film is quite serious and grim, but there is some very discreet humour in it, especially during the moments in which foreign correspondents and the representative of Swiss Red Cross object to their treatment by Japanese - the answer is always the same: ""If you wish to file a complaint, please consult the Bureau of Enlightenment"". I will let you discover by yourself what EXACTLY is the ""Bureau of Enlightenment"" in this film - I will just say that for this idea of contrast of name and reality of the thing Lewis Milestone should have been nominated for an Oscar...)))More seriously, to the best of my knowledge during the period of militaristic regime in Japan there was no such an institution - but this name was obviously inspired by the very real Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda (Reichsministerium f&uuml;r Volksaufkl&auml;rung und Propaganda) which existed in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945 and was headed during all this time by Goebbels... Which actually makes all those humoristic moments suddenly not funny at all...Actors did a good job in ""Purple Heart"", even if with the exception of Dana Andrews all of them are almost completely forgotten today. That being said, some of those less known appeared later in well known films - Farley Granger played main characters in two famous Hitchcock movies (""Rope"" and ""Strangers on a train"") and Richard Conte played the small but important role of Don Barzini in ""Godfather"". As for Don ""Red"" Barry, he played 251 (two hundred fifty one) roles during a career which lasted from 1933 to 1981!Most left-winged people, who hate patriotism, honour and everything that wears uniform, will not like this film. I am also certain they will especially dislike THE speech by Dana Andrews which begins with words ""No your excellency. It's true we Americans don't know very much about you Japanese. And we never did."" and that they will HATE the ending. Therefore this film is really not for everybody.Me on another hand, notwithstanding some of its flaws, I liked it, I am glad that I bought it and I will keep it for a possible future viewing - in memory of heroes of all races and creeds who between 1931 and 1945 fought and defeated the three powers of Axis and made this world a better place.",4,Eight men await death in a slaughter pen - but

The Japanese enemy has pretty much been given a relatively free ride due to the mind-numbing atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis in carrying out their Final Solution.  But Allied prisoners had a 99% chance of surviving their stint in a German POW camp.  Only 58% survived the Japanese camps and those that did had been reduced to mere skin and bones.

The rape of Naking, as well as the treatment of American POWs are just two examples of the brutality of these people pre WWII.Gen. MacArthur, though widely criticized for not prosecuting the Emperor, who had full complicity in war crimes and in the war of aggression, used Hirohito to bring peace.  He brought over missionaries and set them up as school teachers, and did an amazing job in de-militarizing the Japanese people and bringing peace to a people who were raised on pagan Emperor worship.  He changed their society from the ground up.No Hollywood movie, thus far, has truly shown how brutal and animalistic the Japanese military were, and this movie is no exception.  They did a mock trial and executed these brave men.For AMC to call it racist propaganda because the judges cheered when news that MacArthur had left  Corigidor shows only that they care more for political correctness rather than factual correctness.don't miss this movie.  Never forget what foreign aggression did to our nation while sleeping peacefully on a December Sunday morning, in 1941.

The Japanese are besides themselves to determine where the raiding planes came from, and an Army general is convinced it was from a carrier.  A naval admiral, responsible for defending the homeland, is equally convinced that it could not have been a carrier raid.The acting by Dana Andrews and others is fine and you root for the crews as they are subjected to physical abuse and one-sided court room rules to extract the desired information.  They are so alone and without defenses other than their trust in one another.  And it is that interplay between the crew members and their support for one another that is the strength of the film.The negative is that this is a war-time film with the Japanese presented as heartless, conniving, semi-humans.  You expect at any moment for one of the Japanese officers to say, ""So you Yankee dog, you see I understand your country.  I U-C-R-A class of 1938!""
