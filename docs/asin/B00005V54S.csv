Although I recommend getting it by buying the boxed set ""Twin Peaks Gold"" which has the whole series and the pilot episode. This pilot episode I purchased is excellent in picture quality, but the soundtrack sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. If the soundtrack was not a problem, I would have given it 5 stars. I have heard the pilot episode that is included in the Twin Peaks Gold box set has a remastered version with no problems at all. I already had Twin Peaks season 1 and 2, so I purchased this pilot episode separately. If you are buying the whole series for the first time, get the Twin Peaks Gold box set, and avoid the tin can soundtrack of the pilot episode sold separately.Adam Link",4,A must have for Twin Peaks fans.,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,770,"['are', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'fan', 'must', 'have', '2', 'hour', 'pilot', 'episode', 'recommend', 'getting', 'buying', 'boxed', 'set', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Gold', 'whole', 'series', 'pilot', 'episode', 'pilot', 'episode', 'purchased', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'recorded', 'tin', 'can', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'not', 'problem', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'have', 'heard', 'pilot', 'episode', 'included', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Gold', 'box', 'set', 'remastered', 'version', 'problems', 'already', 'had', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'season', '1', '2', 'so', 'purchased', 'pilot', 'episode', 'separately', 'are', 'buying', 'whole', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'get', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Gold', 'box', 'set', 'avoid', 'tin', 'can', 'soundtrack', 'pilot', 'episode', 'sold', 'separately.Adam', 'Link']",N/A

This is a required pre-purchase for the Season One set.I bought a copy online from Hong Kong before this version was available for sale at Amazon.  I was disappointed by the sound as well and assumed that the copy I had purchased was a bootleg.  It is interesting to see that others experienced the same problem and described it here...  Any ""white noise"" (falling water, wind rushing through trees) is converted somehow into an electronic static ""noise"" instead.A small price to pay, I suppose, to make the excellent Season One set complete.

687885,A33693RRRFK55Q,B00005V54S,"B. Erickson ""boycorrupted""","[8, 12]","So I wrote a critical review of this DVD in which I complained about the poor sound and picture quality, and the fact that the pilot was not included in the DVD box set of the First Season as would seem logical. Then some guy submitted a review in which he kindly explained that this was due to a licensing issue between WB and Propaganda, etc, the usual nonsense - see ""grailwolf"" - and defended this version of the pilot as being the one which meshes with the rest of the series, unlike the ""European Version"" which was made as a feature film, with a weird tacked-on ending that was supposed to ""wrap things up"" in case the series didn't get picked up. (He's probably also the one who voted my complaining review ""unhelpful""...lol.)Well, fine. Yeah, I guess this is the best we can do right now. It's still a shame that due to retarded issues like these we can't have it all in a single package, but whatever. The real tragedy is that you can't get the Second Season on DVD at all right now, again probably because people are concerned about making money. So, I'm still complaining about the fact that I have to look at ""Sex in the City"" boxed sets every time I go to the store, but ""Twin Peaks"" is criminally neglected - I guess that shows you where the popular taste lies, God help us all.Anyway. Why did this show fascinate so many people in the first place? Well, watch this pilot! David Lynch has taken all the typical elements of this sort of Stephen King-descended small town mystery story and applied his usual disjointed, surrealistic sensibility. The result is that you have a broad cast of highly stylized characters who all behave like they're missing a few screws, and who are ALL ""full of secrets."" The acting is in that sort of ""corny-but-intentionally-so"" film noir vein. The dialogue, the sets, everything is designed to make you feel like you're in another world whose rules you don't quite know, a world where anything could happen - and DOES happen. It's hilarious the way the characters explain away things like the strobing fluorescent lights on Laura Palmer's corpse in the hospital, or the deer head on the table at the post office - ""It fell down"" - which are obviously only there for atmosphere, and add to the dreamlike quality. The high school kids are all weirdly 1950's acting, in spite of whatever bizarre secrets they might have - from Audrey Horne's spacey pinup girl to Bobby Briggs' West Side Story gang member on crystal meth (what is the deal with his histrionics?) to Laura Palmer's baby-voiced corrupted youth. So much is introduced in this pilot that it's not surprising that you could chew on it for a couple seasons. If people eventually got a little frustrated with the crazy plot twists, it's probably because this really should've been a miniseries rather than a typical TV show - you just couldn't go on season after season without solving Laura's murder, regardless of how many other subplots you had going. But there is definitely way too much juice in the pilot for it all to be condenced to a feature film - as the ""European Version"" illustrates.So OK, go ahead and buy this. In spite of the technical problems, it's gonna have to make due. Let's hope eventually the whole series finds it place on a well-produced DVD set as it TOTALLY should.",2,2 stars for the DVD - pilot gets 5,1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,3295,"['So', 'wrote', 'critical', 'review', 'DVD', 'complained', 'poor', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'fact', 'pilot', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'First', 'Season', 'as', 'would', 'seem', 'logical', 'Then', 'guy', 'submitted', 'review', 'kindly', 'explained', 'was', 'due', 'licensing', 'issue', 'WB', 'Propaganda', 'etc', 'usual', 'nonsense', 'see', 'grailwolf', 'defended', 'version', 'pilot', 'being', 'one', 'rest', 'series', 'European', 'Version', 'was', 'made', 'feature', 'film', 'weird', 'tacked-on', 'ending', 'was', 'supposed', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'case', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'probably', 'also', 'one', 'who', 'voted', 'complaining', 'review', 'unhelpful', 'lol', 'Well', 'fine', 'Yeah', 'guess', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'right', 'now', 'still', 'shame', 'due', 'retarded', 'issues', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'single', 'package', 'real', 'tragedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Second', 'Season', 'DVD', 'right', 'now', 'again', 'probably', 'people', 'are', 'concerned', 'making', 'money', 'So', ""'m"", 'still', 'complaining', 'fact', 'have', 'look', 'Sex', 'City', 'boxed', 'sets', 'time', 'go', 'store', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'criminally', 'neglected', 'guess', 'where', 'popular', 'taste', 'lies', 'God', 'help', 'all.Anyway', 'Why', 'did', 'show', 'fascinate', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'first', 'place', 'Well', 'watch', 'pilot', 'David', 'Lynch', 'taken', 'typical', 'elements', 'sort', 'Stephen', 'King-descended', 'small', 'town', 'mystery', 'story', 'applied', 'usual', 'disjointed', 'surrealistic', 'sensibility', 'result', 'have', 'broad', 'cast', 'highly', 'stylized', 'characters', 'who', 'behave', ""'re"", 'missing', 'few', 'screws', 'who', 'are', 'full', 'secrets', 'acting', 'sort', 'corny-but-intentionally-so', 'film', 'noir', 'vein', 'dialogue', 'sets', 'everything', 'designed', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'world', 'rules', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'world', 'where', 'anything', 'could', 'happen', 'DOES', 'happen', 'hilarious', 'way', 'characters', 'explain', 'away', 'things', 'strobing', 'fluorescent', 'lights', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'corpse', 'hospital', 'deer', 'head', 'table', 'post', 'office', 'fell', 'down', 'are', 'obviously', 'only', 'there', 'atmosphere', 'add', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'are', 'weirdly', '1950', 'acting', 'spite', 'bizarre', 'secrets', 'might', 'have', 'Audrey', 'Horne', 'spacey', 'pinup', 'girl', 'Bobby', 'Briggs', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'gang', 'member', 'crystal', 'meth', 'what', 'deal', 'histrionics', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'baby-voiced', 'corrupted', 'youth', 'So', 'much', 'introduced', 'pilot', 'not', 'surprising', 'could', 'chew', 'couple', 'seasons', 'people', 'eventually', 'got', 'little', 'frustrated', 'crazy', 'plot', 'twists', 'probably', 'really', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'miniseries', 'rather', 'typical', 'TV', 'show', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'season', 'season', 'solving', 'Laura', 'murder', 'regardless', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'subplots', 'had', 'going', 'definitely', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'juice', 'pilot', 'be', 'condenced', 'feature', 'film', 'European', 'Version', 'illustrates.So', 'OK', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'spite', 'technical', 'problems', 'gon', 'na', 'have', 'make', 'due', 'Let', 'hope', 'eventually', 'whole', 'series', 'place', 'well-produced', 'DVD', 'set', 'TOTALLY', 'should']",N/A

687889,A3BXK3HE0XUG7,B00005V54S,Douglas Hahner,"[3, 3]","What an unbelievable start for a television show.  This is probably one of the best pilots I have ever seen.  You just get sucked in right away.Much like Agent Cooper I was drawn in by the utter beauty of the town of Twin Peaks.  There are lush trees, beautiful waterfalls, and a quaint town.  However David Lynch, being David Lynch likes to scratch below the surface and show us that even a beautiful town like Twin Peaks holds some very dark secrets.How fitting then that he casts Kyle MacLachlan as the FBI agent investigating Laura Palmer's murder.  Kyle's Agent Cooper is almost a grown up version of the character he played in Blue Velvet.  I say almost because Cooper has a bit of an edge to him that shines through his childlike innocence at moments.  Great examples of this are when he is examining Laura's body, and the crime scene.  His deductive skills come out, and he seems completely in charge of the scene, and knows exactly what he is looking for.As for the DVD itself, the picture is standard video quality.  Not DVD quality, but it won't hurt your eyes to look at it.  As for the sound, I have no complaints.

And while the release of ""Twin Peaks -- Pilot Episode"" is out of sync with the first season release, this eerie and entrancing story will reel you in. It's cult TV at its absolute best.The body of a beautiful young woman, Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), washes up on a shore, wrapped in plastic. Apparently everyone in the town of Twin Peaks adored her, so her death is a blow. FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) takes a look at Laura's body -- and learns that she was murdered by someone he has tracked before.He investigates Laura's diary, and finds that she may have been killed by someone she called ""J."" That hardly narrows it down, since the strange Twin Peaks is full of quirky people with that initial. And as Cooper investigates further, he finds himself in a town of dark secrets and strange occurrances -- and still the mystery of who killed Laura.Due to some bizarre legal wrangles, the Twin Peaks pilot wasn't released with the first season of the show -- which is like releasing ""Return of the Jedi"" and ""Empire Strikes Back"" separately from ""A New Hope."" Additionally, a pasted-on ending which reveals who murdered Laura is included. Despite these flaws, the pilot in itself is a magnificent piece of work, quirky and dark and twisted.Drugs, murder, ghosts, precognition, dancing dwarves, supernatural possession and murder all crop up in the TV series, and this pilot set it all up -- it's not the best of the series, but it serves as a good set-up. And Lynch's handling of the solidly ordinary Northwest America is turned into a bizarre thing. Under the banality and the boringness is a dark undercurrent, making the town all the more eerie. But it's also so FUNNY at times -- Cooper and the quirky Twin-Peak-ites provide a sort of deadpan comedy to the proceedings.It's also not just a murder mystery, but a study of the strange, layered characters. Kyle MacLachlan does an exceptional job as Cooper -- he's obviously a bit of a nutjob and neatnik, but a cheerful and likable one. He's backed by a cast of quirky, odd characters, including Lara Flynn Boyle, Ray Wise, Piper Laurie and  Michael Ontkean.Before the ""X-Files"" made the surreal a hit, before ""Carnivale"" took surrealism and ran with it, there was the magnificently weird ""Twin Peaks.""

In the short run, it caused a nationwide sensation as the whole country grappled with the maddeningly convoluted question of who killed Laura Palmer.  ....For those who don't know what the pilot is about, in short summary Pete Martell, who runs a local Twin Peaks sawmill, discovers popular high school student Laura Palmer's body by a lake.  ""She's dead, Harry.  Wrapped in plastic.""  The remainder of the pilot is set during the course of this tragic Friday, as we are introduced to the characters of Twin Peaks and the surreal environment they inhabit.  Agent Cooper of the FBI drives into town to join the investigation after a second raped girl, Ronette Pulaski, is discovered wandering across state lines.  Blame for the murder originally focuses on slacker Bobby Briggs, then on biker James Hurley.  As the pilot unfolds, we learn about the bewildering number of adulterous relationships, backhanded scheming, and criminal undercurrents that define the dark mystique of this wooded paradise.There is a bonus in store for Twin Peaks fans - the pilot concludes with the ORIGINAL TELEVISION ENDING, something which until now was almost impossible to find anywhere.  This allows the pilot to flow right into Episode 1 of the Artisan box set, which should be a pleasant development for Twin Peaks collectors.As far as the quality of the DVD itself goes, the picture is superior to its VHS and LD predecessors, although nowhere near on par with the Artisan set.  The sound, though leaves something to be desired.  Although the sound is reasonably crisp, the mixing was less than perfect.  Some have also pointed out that the pilot may have been dubbed from PAL (it is from Asia) - this means that a conversion to NTSC resulted in a slight two to three percent speeding up of the sound and picture.  There have been complaints that this changed the pitch of the music and made Agent Cooper sound overly nasal, but the results are minimal and easily overlooked.  Besides, many networks already do this on purpose to squeeze in more advertisenments, and most people don't seem to notice.  Not that I'm defending it, but I can live with the results for now.Would I love to see Paramount or Warner Bros. release the pilot domestically?  Absolutely!  But in the meantime, this is an indespensable partner to the Artisan box set.  I give it four stars only because the DVD quality COULD be better, but the pilot itself is worth at least six stars!",4,"The classic ""Twin Peaks"" pilot is now on DVD!",1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,2654,"['Twin', 'Peaks', 'intense', 'bizarre', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'masterpiece', 'television', 'series', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'may', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'air', 'little', 'over', 'year', 'changed', 'course', 'TV', 'history', 'short', 'run', 'caused', 'nationwide', 'sensation', 'whole', 'country', 'grappled', 'maddeningly', 'convoluted', 'question', 'who', 'killed', 'Laura', 'Palmer', '.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'pilot', 'about', 'short', 'summary', 'Pete', 'Martell', 'who', 'local', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'sawmill', 'discovers', 'popular', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'body', 'lake', 'dead', 'Harry', 'Wrapped', 'plastic', 'remainder', 'pilot', 'set', 'course', 'tragic', 'Friday', 'are', 'introduced', 'characters', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'surreal', 'environment', 'inhabit', 'Agent', 'Cooper', 'FBI', 'town', 'join', 'investigation', 'second', 'raped', 'girl', 'Ronette', 'Pulaski', 'discovered', 'wandering', 'state', 'lines', 'Blame', 'murder', 'originally', 'slacker', 'Bobby', 'Briggs', 'then', 'biker', 'James', 'Hurley', 'pilot', 'unfolds', 'learn', 'bewildering', 'number', 'adulterous', 'relationships', 'backhanded', 'scheming', 'criminal', 'undercurrents', 'define', 'dark', 'mystique', 'wooded', 'paradise.There', 'bonus', 'store', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'fans', 'pilot', 'ORIGINAL', 'TELEVISION', 'ENDING', 'something', 'now', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'find', 'anywhere', 'pilot', 'flow', 'right', 'Episode', '1', 'Artisan', 'box', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'pleasant', 'development', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'collectors.As', 'far', 'quality', 'DVD', 'picture', 'superior', 'VHS', 'LD', 'predecessors', 'nowhere', 'par', 'Artisan', 'set', 'sound', 'leaves', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'sound', 'reasonably', 'crisp', 'mixing', 'was', 'less', 'perfect', 'have', 'also', 'pointed', 'out', 'pilot', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'dubbed', 'PAL', 'Asia', 'conversion', 'NTSC', 'resulted', 'slight', 'two', 'three', 'percent', 'speeding', 'sound', 'picture', 'have', 'been', 'complaints', 'changed', 'pitch', 'music', 'made', 'Agent', 'Cooper', 'sound', 'overly', 'nasal', 'results', 'are', 'minimal', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'Besides', 'many', 'networks', 'already', 'do', 'purpose', 'squeeze', 'more', 'advertisenments', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'notice', 'Not', ""'m"", 'defending', 'can', 'live', 'results', 'now.Would', 'love', 'see', 'Paramount', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'release', 'pilot', 'domestically', 'Absolutely', 'meantime', 'indespensable', 'partner', 'Artisan', 'box', 'set', 'give', 'four', 'only', 'DVD', 'quality', 'COULD', 'be', 'better', 'pilot', 'worth', 'least', 'six', 'stars']",N/A

I was one of the very first to get it in the States and even then there were so many reviews that said what I was going to say that I decided to skip it. However, reading some of the negative reviews I think that many people do not understand the situation with this release. Yes, it has problems and you should go in with your eyes open. But it's not as bad as some make it out to be.First of all, the negatives. As other reviewers have already mentioned, the sound seems to be sped up. I suspect that it is actually just a pitch change, as the action still looks normal and the voices still synch. The video has some slight artifacts, and the special features are really pretty nonexistant.In any other DVD, this would make me tear my hair out (or, at least, return the disc). But the negatives are far outweighed by the positives. In order to explain why, let me give a brief history.When the pilot for Twin Peaks was made, the money was provided by Warner Bros. Since it was not known at the time whether a network would buy the series, WB insisted that Lynch/Frost produce an ending for the pilot. That way, if the series wasn't picked up, they could get their money back by selling the pilot as a stand-alone movie. The ending produced really didn't wrap anything up, but the footage was designed to be salvaged later as Cooper's dream in episode 2. The pilot, with the surreal ending, was shown briefly in some theaters in Europe before ABC greenlit the series, thus it is sometimes called the &quot;European version&quot;.Fast forward to the end of the series. When the decision was made to release the series on video, Propaganda films realized that it couldn't get rights to the pilot. WB refused to give the rights up because they hadn't made all the money that they could. They released the pilot on their own (separate from the series episodes and never mentioning that it was a series in the first place) on both VHS and LaserDisc. Problem is that they released the version with their &quot;special unaired footage&quot;. In other words, the artificial ending that was produced under duress and that keeps the &quot;European version&quot; from meshing with the rest of the series. This version was NOT the way it was intended to be seen, despite what some reviewers have claimed.Until now, that has been the only version ever available on any sort of video. The pilot was broadcast in its intended form three times by ABC (its initial airing, and then twice over the summer to increase viewership for season 2) and several times by Bravo (as part of their &quot;TV Too Good For TV&quot; nights). Other than that, no one in the US has seen the correct version of the pilot until this DVD became available.So, the positives? Simply, they are the fact that we now have a version of the pilot that we can play before watching the rest of the series without having to go into a fifteen minute explanation of why the ending doesn't fit with the beginning of the next episode. We can see Sarah Palmer's correct vision (the one referenced later in the series). We can, just for a moment, go back to the first time we saw the show and remember gathering with friends awaiting the next revelations from Lynch & co. without having to do some fancy editing work or pull out our ancient, fading tapes from 1990.Don't listen to the complainers.

Carlin ""arca20""","[12, 13]","The first thing to say about this DVD is that it is the pilot episode for the series and NOT the ""European"" version which was had an extra half hour tagged on at the end. Therefore this ends with Sarah Palmer's vision which leads into the series and is not a self contained film.For those who don't know the story, Twin Peaks is a North-West American town filled with wonderful and quirky characters. The initial impression is of a quiet little town living in a psuedo-50s world. The discovery of the body of local high school girl Laura Palmer shakes the town to the core. The discovery of a brutalised Ronnette Pulaski, classmate of Laura, points to the work of a serial killer which brings FBI special agent Dale Cooper to the town in the hope of uncovering the murderer's identity. Compared with later episodes, the pilot is more restrained, being a simply murder mystery story which gives us a glimpse of Twin Peaks and its inhabitants. As the series progressed, the quirkiness of those inhabitants and the deeper, darker mysteries of the town would be revealed.Enough has already been said about this DVD but I should mention that I found the sound quality unbearable - the average Joe will have to do a lot of fiddling to get even decent sound from the DVD and the experience is ultimately unsatisfying. The pitcure quality is reasonable but is not up to the standards of the majority of DVDs.Story wise I would rate this DVD five starsPicture quality I would rate it three starsExtras - no starsSound quality - no starsI am a great fan of Twin Peaks and have watched the series every year (I have it on laserdisc and have a rather worn out VHS of the pilot from its original broadcast) but I was very disappointed in this DVD and sold my copy on.

Even in the import edition. No, I had no oscilloscopes, meters, stopwatches, or any other test equipment to evaluate this Taiwan knock-off. Yes, the sound seemed a tad off from what was recorded in my memory-but my memory is more than a decade old, and I wasn't pumping the DVD through a monster Hanging-Gardens-of-Babylon home entertainment center. And yes, when you move along from this pilot DVD to the First Season DVDs released by Artisan, you will note the difference.BUT:David Lynch devotees should be delighted-and relieved-to have this DVD (which, I should point out, is available from Hong Kong distributors at a fraction of the price on this page),  without which the experience of Twin Peaks' first season is woefully incomplete.

687910,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005V54S,Robert Moore,"[19, 19]","I should dock this disc a star for its sub par production, but I won't simply because the episode itself is so superb.There are two things wrong with this DVD:  first, releasing the pilot as a stand alone instead of incorporating it with the first season, and second, the inferior sound and video.  Some of the reviewers are questioning the latter, but I can attest that when one compares one of the DVDs from the first season box set with the pilot DVD, there sound and video quality are not anywhere near the same.  It does not render the show unwatchable, but it does detract from one's enjoyment.The first of the two reasons I cite is equally unforgivable.  Not only do I find it unforgivable to not include the pilot in the box set, I am not clear why they didn't just collect both seasons and the pilot in one set.  It isn't as if there are that many minutes or episodes package.  If shows like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and THE SOPRANOS, which contain more minutes in one season than TWIN PEAKS did in total, can be easily packaged in one boxed set, why not it?  What makes not including the pilot incomprehensible is the fact that the series makes absolutely no sense without the pilot, and the pilot doesn't mean anything without the ensuing episodes.  From first to finish, these decisions baffle me, especially when one considers that the pilot is not currently available except for this import.The fact that this is one of the most phenomenal TV series in history makes this even more lamentable.  TWIN PEAKS is simultaneously one of the best and one of the most influential shows the medium has ever seen.  America has never been as friendly towards Surrealism as has Europe, but one might make the case that David Lynch is our most important exponent of it.  What makes the series so brilliant is the way that Lynch manages to blend surrealism, film noir, Hitchcockian humor (less recognized but just as influential as Hitchcockian suspense), and soap opera to create what was, up to that time, arguably the finest series TV had ever seen (though shows like THE PRISONER could easily take issue with that judgment).  The show is so stylized as to almost succumb to self-parody, but even in the most delightfully absurd scenes, the show manages to hit precisely the right tone and balance.The influence of TWIN PEAKS can be found in nearly every show that has tried to move away from a traditional self-contained episode format to longer story arcs.  There had been shows that had tried to tell stories over a longer period of time.  HILL STREET BLUES had had this approach, although one could still watch any one episode without having seen it before.  But TWIN PEAKS made no sense whatsoever in episode-sized chunks.  Except perhaps for shows the fourth season of ANGEL or a couple of seasons of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER or 24, no other show has places so much emphasis on the story as a whole.  Without TWIN PEAKS, the long story arcs of THE X-FILES would have been impossible, as well as BABYLON FIVE, and BUFFY and ANGEL, and the whole host of shows that have followed, including THE SOPRANOS and DEAD LIKE ME.  In all these shows, echoes of TWIN PEAKS can be heard.Unfortunately, until they choose to produce a better quality edition of the pilot, this DVD will remain absolutely essential for anyone interested in the rest of the episodes.",5,Poor quality DVD of an absolutely essential episode,1068768000,"11 14, 2003",2003,3358,"['should', 'dock', 'disc', 'star', 'sub', 'par', 'production', 'wo', ""n't"", 'simply', 'episode', 'so', 'superb.There', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'first', 'releasing', 'pilot', 'stand', 'alone', 'instead', 'incorporating', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'inferior', 'sound', 'video', 'reviewers', 'are', 'questioning', 'latter', 'can', 'attest', 'when', 'one', 'one', 'DVDs', 'first', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'pilot', 'DVD', 'sound', 'video', 'quality', 'are', 'not', 'anywhere', 'same', 'not', 'render', 'show', 'unwatchable', 'detract', 'one', 'enjoyment.The', 'first', 'two', 'reasons', 'cite', 'equally', 'unforgivable', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'find', 'unforgivable', 'not', 'include', 'pilot', 'box', 'set', 'am', 'not', 'clear', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'collect', 'seasons', 'pilot', 'one', 'set', ""n't"", 'as', 'are', 'many', 'minutes', 'episodes', 'package', 'shows', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'THE', 'SOPRANOS', 'contain', 'more', 'minutes', 'one', 'season', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'did', 'total', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'packaged', 'one', 'boxed', 'set', 'why', 'not', 'What', 'not', 'including', 'pilot', 'incomprehensible', 'fact', 'series', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'pilot', 'pilot', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'ensuing', 'episodes', 'first', 'finish', 'decisions', 'baffle', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'pilot', 'not', 'currently', 'available', 'import.The', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'phenomenal', 'TV', 'series', 'history', 'even', 'more', 'lamentable', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'simultaneously', 'one', 'best', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'medium', 'ever', 'seen', 'America', 'never', 'been', 'friendly', 'towards', 'Surrealism', 'Europe', 'one', 'might', 'make', 'case', 'David', 'Lynch', 'most', 'important', 'exponent', 'What', 'series', 'so', 'brilliant', 'way', 'Lynch', 'blend', 'surrealism', 'film', 'noir', 'Hitchcockian', 'humor', 'less', 'recognized', 'just', 'as', 'influential', 'Hitchcockian', 'suspense', 'soap', 'opera', 'create', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'time', 'arguably', 'finest', 'series', 'TV', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'shows', 'PRISONER', 'could', 'easily', 'take', 'issue', 'judgment', 'show', 'so', 'stylized', 'almost', 'succumb', 'self-parody', 'even', 'most', 'delightfully', 'absurd', 'scenes', 'show', 'hit', 'precisely', 'right', 'tone', 'balance.The', 'influence', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'nearly', 'show', 'tried', 'move', 'away', 'traditional', 'self-contained', 'episode', 'format', 'longer', 'story', 'arcs', 'had', 'been', 'shows', 'had', 'tried', 'tell', 'stories', 'longer', 'period', 'time', 'HILL', 'STREET', 'BLUES', 'had', 'had', 'approach', 'one', 'could', 'still', 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'having', 'seen', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'made', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'episode-sized', 'chunks', 'perhaps', 'shows', 'fourth', 'season', 'ANGEL', 'couple', 'seasons', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', '24', 'other', 'show', 'places', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'story', 'whole', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'long', 'story', 'arcs', 'THE', 'X-FILES', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'as', 'well', 'BABYLON', 'FIVE', 'BUFFY', 'ANGEL', 'whole', 'host', 'shows', 'have', 'followed', 'including', 'THE', 'SOPRANOS', 'DEAD', 'LIKE', 'ME', 'shows', 'echoes', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'can', 'be', 'heard.Unfortunately', 'choose', 'produce', 'better', 'quality', 'edition', 'pilot', 'DVD', 'will', 'remain', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'anyone', 'interested', 'rest', 'episodes']",N/A

Sure for those of us who have videotaped copies or laserdisc copies of the pilot, there's recourse but the chillig pilot episode needs to be seen to appreciate the rest of the series. I imagine that the second season would have seen release and the boxed set would have sold better if the pilot had been included.The picture quality varies a bit in quality. Overall, it's not bad but it doesn't compare to that of the high definition transfer that's a highlight of the boxed set. The sound is pretty bad but you can listen to it. I really didn't notice that the pitch of the voices was all that different but it's probably due to the fact that overseas video is in a different format (PAL) than the U.S. (NTSC). The differences in the two formats would certainly explain that issue.. That would explain the incorrect pitch and the fact that it's a bit too fast to some folks. Color is an issue in some scenes as the picture does appear too yellow in others but overall the picture quality is good but far from great.Someone commented earlier that this is an edited version of the pilot. No, actually it's the entire pilot run a slightly higher speed. The original pilot ran roughly 90 minutes (two television episodes average about 43 minutes a piece and that pilot was essentially two episodes back-to-back).Unfortunately there's no extras to speak of except some really bad preview trailers and some information on the cast. Reportedly Paramount resumes control of the ""Twin Peaks"" license in 2005 so my guess is we'll see the pilot repacked with the first season (and available separately hopefully) along with the second season of the show.5 stars for the pilot which created a mixture of an oblique mystery and an inversion of the traditional sopa opera and 2 stars for the transfer.",4,"Great pilot episode so-so sound, no extras worth noting",1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,1856,"['pilot', 'episode', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'boxed', 'set', 'useless', 'Sure', 'who', 'have', 'videotaped', 'copies', 'laserdisc', 'copies', 'pilot', 'recourse', 'chillig', 'pilot', 'episode', 'be', 'seen', 'appreciate', 'rest', 'series', 'imagine', 'second', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'release', 'boxed', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'sold', 'better', 'pilot', 'had', 'been', 'included.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'bit', 'quality', 'Overall', 'not', 'bad', ""n't"", 'compare', 'high', 'definition', 'transfer', 'highlight', 'boxed', 'set', 'sound', 'pretty', 'bad', 'can', 'listen', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'pitch', 'voices', 'was', 'different', 'probably', 'due', 'fact', 'overseas', 'video', 'different', 'format', 'PAL', 'U.S.', 'NTSC', 'differences', 'two', 'formats', 'would', 'certainly', 'explain', 'issue..', 'would', 'explain', 'incorrect', 'pitch', 'fact', 'bit', 'too', 'fast', 'folks', 'Color', 'issue', 'scenes', 'picture', 'appear', 'too', 'yellow', 'others', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'far', 'great.Someone', 'commented', 'earlier', 'edited', 'version', 'pilot', 'No', 'actually', 'entire', 'pilot', 'run', 'slightly', 'higher', 'speed', 'original', 'pilot', 'ran', 'roughly', '90', 'minutes', 'two', 'television', 'episodes', 'average', '43', 'minutes', 'piece', 'pilot', 'was', 'essentially', 'two', 'episodes', 'back-to-back', '.Unfortunately', 'extras', 'speak', 'really', 'bad', 'preview', 'trailers', 'information', 'cast', 'Reportedly', 'Paramount', 'resumes', 'control', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'license', '2005', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'see', 'pilot', 'repacked', 'first', 'season', 'available', 'separately', 'hopefully', 'second', 'season', 'show.5', 'stars', 'pilot', 'created', 'mixture', 'oblique', 'mystery', 'inversion', 'traditional', 'sopa', 'opera', '2', 'stars', 'transfer']",N/A

But if you want to enjoy the rest of the series, starting with the terrific First Season transfers, you need to see the complete pilot, and this is the only version of it.If you've read this far, you probably know that, and you're going through all these contradictory reviews to make up your mind whether the audio and video quality of this import version is good enough to buy.So mine is just another opinion by someone you don't know, but maybe it will help anyway.First, I side with the guy who says that if you have 5.1 Surround sound, it doesn't sound bad at all.  I have to believe from the other reviews that if you only have two-channel playback, it sounds very bad.Visually, it's not nearly as good as it should be, compared with the beautifully transferred First Season collection -- but it *is* better than VHS and will last longer.Finally, it's the only way to get the real pilot for the forseeable future.  The old VHS versions floating around are all of the European release, which was a version of the pilot padded out with extraneous footage and given a completely arbitrary and pointless ending so that it could be seen in European theaters as a complete-in-itself movie.  On which point:DO NOT BELIEVE THE REVIEW THAT SAYS THIS IS A SHORTENED VERSION.  THIS *IS* THE COMPLETE PILOT.  Proof:  It's ninety minutes long.  The pilot was originally aired in a two-hour time-slot.  At that time, 15 minutes of commercials per hour was standard.  (It's more like 17 or 18 now.)  Two hours minus thirty minutes is ninety minutes.  The VHS version was, again, padded out with extraneous footage and a pointless, jury-rigged ending, and that's why it was rather longer.  But THIS is the version you need to see before you watch the First Season collection.  There's a rights problem that prevented the pilot from being packaged with the rest of the first season--who knows if it will ever be resolved?
