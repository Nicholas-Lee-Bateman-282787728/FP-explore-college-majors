189508,A1PASRZ81DY9C,1573623857,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 10/07Rate: 310/07: Gosh, I was so disappointed. Halfway through Another 9  Weeks, I was being intrigued so heavily, and then after the movie ended, I felt so cheaply deceived. I didn't know what is worse: suffering from an unmitigated disaster or looking at Mickey Rourke's face. Thinking of the latter, it's quite possible that he only accepted the role to support the payments for his unnecessary plastic surgeries. Going to the beginning of Another 9  Weeks, I felt it started off fairly well. As time went on, I quickly learned that it was going to be a reunion of John and Elizabeth, the famous screen couple from 9  Weeks, while John was in search for her. My breath was taken away, and I was witnessing something potentially a great film in history. The idea of him meeting her and seeing what would happen, it would be awe-inspiring. As Another 9  Weeks was sitting on a gold mine, Mickey Rourke reclaimed the acting style, evident from early 80's films, that made him extremely unique. Then the F-bomb was laid. After learning what had happened to Elizabeth, the film turned into a damn waste of time because basically nothing happened afterwards. It's as if John only sought for Elizabeth to receive one last f***. How Anne Goursand treated John as a character was humiliating display of shame. Why couldn't Another 9  Weeks be so deep as John would be in path of desperation, desolateness, and regretful days because he ""let"" her go? It surely would have been the most powerful picture to ever come out. But nooooooooo........ Another 9  Weeks became a sex picture that ran low in fumes, only this time with a stunning looker who can't act. Everything in Another 9  Weeks was about recreation of what transpired in 9  Weeks. One scene, I remembered in Another 9  Weeks, that was brilliantly done, where John said, ""You just don't get it, do you?"" Exactly was how I felt about everybody who was behind Another 9  Weeks. I should have had a mixture of feelings after seeing Another 9  Weeks, but I rather viewed the picture as an ultimately cheap rip-off of its original. While watching the sex scenes (and they all stunk so bad), I wanted to watch 9  Weeks once again and study how those scenes were brilliantly constructed and inserted with this wonderful tension and breathtaking power. I thought one of the answers I have was the mysteriousness of John. When that was taken away from Mickey Rourke in Another 9  Weeks, his character ceased to bring any kind of energy. It was simply flat. That's a good way of how I like to describe the failure of Wild Orchid. Comparing both the films, Another 9  Weeks was somewhat a better film than Wild Orchid, but both were left in dust by 9  Weeks, a cinematic masterpiece. To be honest with you, Another 9  Weeks had so much potential to be great, but the way it was handled, all I was left with was an albatross of disappointment. Even so, I didn't think the new affair lasted nine and half weeks at all. It was more like a week and half. The way the movie ended was a thundering silence of ""what the hell?"" So, you meant to tell me that all John did was to walk around, contemplate, and chain smoke? Exactly what was he thinking of? I will never know, but surely there was nothing on his mind because Mickey was faking it. There was a lot of characters that kept getting popped up, but none of them had any meaning to the picture as whole. Same went for the subplot where the girl got slapped around by the boring villain from Mission: Impossible 2. I didn't think the overall acting by the cast killed the film, but there wasn't enough of chemistry to make a reaction. A plus in Another 9  Weeks was its cinematography but was nothing compared to 9  Weeks. All in all, Another 9  Weeks was a complete let down.",2,"You Just Don't Get It, Do You?",1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,3775,"['Viewed', '10/07Rate', '310/07', 'Gosh', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'Halfway', '9', 'Weeks', 'was', 'being', 'intrigued', 'so', 'heavily', 'then', 'movie', 'ended', 'felt', 'so', 'cheaply', 'deceived', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'worse', 'suffering', 'unmitigated', 'disaster', 'looking', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'face', 'Thinking', 'latter', 'quite', 'possible', 'only', 'accepted', 'role', 'support', 'payments', 'unnecessary', 'plastic', 'surgeries', 'Going', 'beginning', '9', 'Weeks', 'felt', 'started', 'off', 'fairly', 'well', 'time', 'went', 'quickly', 'learned', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'reunion', 'John', 'Elizabeth', 'famous', 'screen', 'couple', '9', 'Weeks', 'John', 'was', 'search', 'breath', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'was', 'witnessing', 'something', 'potentially', 'great', 'film', 'history', 'idea', 'meeting', 'seeing', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'would', 'be', 'awe-inspiring', '9', 'Weeks', 'was', 'sitting', 'gold', 'mine', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'reclaimed', 'acting', 'style', 'evident', 'early', '80', 'films', 'made', 'extremely', 'unique', 'Then', 'F-bomb', 'was', 'laid', 'learning', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'Elizabeth', 'film', 'turned', 'damn', 'waste', 'time', 'basically', 'nothing', 'happened', 'afterwards', 'John', 'only', 'sought', 'Elizabeth', 'receive', 'one', 'last', 'f***', 'How', 'Anne', 'Goursand', 'treated', 'John', 'character', 'was', 'humiliating', 'display', 'shame', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", '9', 'Weeks', 'be', 'so', 'deep', 'John', 'would', 'be', 'path', 'desperation', 'desolateness', 'regretful', 'days', 'let', 'go', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'powerful', 'picture', 'ever', 'come', 'out', 'nooooooooo', '9', 'Weeks', 'became', 'sex', 'picture', 'ran', 'low', 'fumes', 'only', 'time', 'stunning', 'looker', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Everything', '9', 'Weeks', 'was', 'recreation', 'what', 'transpired', '9', 'Weeks', 'One', 'scene', 'remembered', '9', 'Weeks', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'where', 'John', 'said', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'Exactly', 'was', 'how', 'felt', 'everybody', 'who', 'was', '9', 'Weeks', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'mixture', 'feelings', 'seeing', '9', 'Weeks', 'rather', 'viewed', 'picture', 'ultimately', 'cheap', 'rip-off', 'original', 'watching', 'sex', 'scenes', 'stunk', 'so', 'bad', 'wanted', 'watch', '9', 'Weeks', 'once', 'again', 'study', 'how', 'scenes', 'were', 'brilliantly', 'constructed', 'inserted', 'wonderful', 'tension', 'breathtaking', 'power', 'thought', 'one', 'answers', 'have', 'was', 'mysteriousness', 'John', 'When', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', '9', 'Weeks', 'character', 'ceased', 'bring', 'kind', 'energy', 'was', 'simply', 'flat', 'good', 'way', 'how', 'like', 'describe', 'failure', 'Wild', 'Orchid', 'Comparing', 'films', '9', 'Weeks', 'was', 'somewhat', 'better', 'film', 'Wild', 'Orchid', 'were', 'left', 'dust', '9', 'Weeks', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'be', 'honest', '9', 'Weeks', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'way', 'was', 'handled', 'was', 'left', 'was', 'albatross', 'disappointment', 'Even', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'new', 'affair', 'lasted', 'nine', 'half', 'weeks', 'was', 'more', 'week', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'ended', 'was', 'thundering', 'silence', 'what', 'hell', 'So', 'meant', 'tell', 'John', 'did', 'was', 'walk', 'contemplate', 'chain', 'smoke', 'Exactly', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'surely', 'was', 'nothing', 'mind', 'Mickey', 'was', 'faking', 'was', 'lot', 'characters', 'kept', 'getting', 'popped', 'up', 'none', 'had', 'meaning', 'picture', 'whole', 'Same', 'went', 'subplot', 'where', 'girl', 'got', 'slapped', 'boring', 'villain', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'overall', 'acting', 'cast', 'killed', 'film', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'chemistry', 'make', 'reaction', 'plus', '9', 'Weeks', 'was', 'cinematography', 'was', 'nothing', 'compared', '9', 'Weeks', '9', 'Weeks', 'was', 'complete', 'let', 'down']",N/A

I am such a Mickey Rourke fan; I am nuts about him and he's so talented.  He must have done this for the money; he brought NOTHING to the movie, and neither did anyone else.  Gorgeous, playful, sexy, cocky John has been replaced by a man with razor-sharp cheek implants, platypus lips, and greasy black hair.  The ""old"" John would have never sat on a park bench and blown his nose or shown his bony knees...blech. Maybe that is why we never ever ever saw him naked in the first movie.  He acts almost effeminate in this one, and his clothes are stupid. There is not ONE redeeming thing here.  Not in the plot...nowhere.  Maybe just in seeing scenes of Paris...so pretty.  I was at least hoping for some eye candy or hot sex.  The sex is lame (we actually only SEE intercourse once) and Mickey looks like a freak show.  I realize people age but damn him for deliberately destroying that face.  And why has his VOICE gone down? I didn't realize grown men's voices get deeper...WTF?  And it wasn't just all that.  The movie just SUCKS. PLEASE, I beg you not to waste your time, no matter how curious.  There are no 9 1/2 Weeks flashbacks.  Just a few lines from it.  But the Lea character keeps talking about ""a whorehouse in Chicago in 1952"" and John never even SAID that in the first movie.

189512,A34D06JL7LC6MU,1573623857,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[7, 8]","As a sequel, there's a few things I respect about ""Another 9 1/2 Weeks"".One: They didn't try to replace the same characters with different actors.Two: They created a new story line based on the old one.Three: Mickey Rourke is back.Four: They didn't try to write off the character Elizabeth from the first one.Usually in sequels (especially straight-to-video ones) they do the opposite of the above. It's a bunch of different actors playing the same characters and other characters have been forgotten about. Anyway, this movie isn't half as good as the first one; but it is entertaining. As for the people who call it mainstream ""soft-core porn"". I have to say that the first movie had more sex and nudity, then this film did. Anyway, Mickey Rourke returns as John, the millionaire from the first movie who can't rekindle the feelings he felt for Elizabeth (who was played by Kim Basinger) in the first film. After trying to recreate an experience from the first movie with a hooker, in the opening sequence, John flips through a catalouge of painting in Paris and finds Elizabeth's name. John hops on a plane and ends up buying all of her paintings. Then, John sees a beautiful woman wearing a scarf he had given Elizabeth. After approaching the woman, John discovers that she is Lea (Angie Everhart, who is hotter than Kim Basinger OK?), Elizabeth's best friend. As John tries to get Lea to tell him where Elizabeth is, he begins an affair with her which isn't even as erotic and romantic as the one in the original. But, yeah, I mean you have to give this movie credit as far as sequels go. Mickey Rourke, who's career was floundering at this point and has had great success since then with movies like ""Sin City"" & ""Domino"",is excellent as John. Simalar to Sharon Stone being the only one to play Catherine is ""Basic Instinct""; it's the same with Rourke as John. This certainly isn't an essential movie for one's collection, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be.GRADE: B-",4,"Not a Masterpiece, But Deserves Some Respect",1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,1986,"['sequel', 'few', 'things', 'respect', '9', '1/2', 'Weeks', '.One', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'replace', 'same', 'characters', 'different', 'actors.Two', 'created', 'new', 'story', 'line', 'based', 'old', 'one.Three', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'back.Four', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'write', 'off', 'character', 'Elizabeth', 'first', 'one.Usually', 'sequels', 'especially', 'straight-to-video', 'ones', 'do', 'opposite', 'above', 'bunch', 'different', 'actors', 'playing', 'same', 'characters', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'forgotten', 'Anyway', 'movie', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'entertaining', 'people', 'who', 'call', 'mainstream', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'have', 'say', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'sex', 'nudity', 'then', 'film', 'did', 'Anyway', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'John', 'millionaire', 'first', 'movie', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rekindle', 'feelings', 'felt', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'first', 'film', 'trying', 'recreate', 'experience', 'first', 'movie', 'hooker', 'opening', 'sequence', 'John', 'catalouge', 'painting', 'Paris', 'Elizabeth', 'name', 'John', 'plane', 'up', 'buying', 'paintings', 'Then', 'John', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'wearing', 'scarf', 'had', 'given', 'Elizabeth', 'approaching', 'woman', 'John', 'Lea', 'Angie', 'Everhart', 'who', 'hotter', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'OK', 'Elizabeth', 'best', 'friend', 'John', 'get', 'Lea', 'tell', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'affair', ""n't"", 'even', 'erotic', 'romantic', 'one', 'original', 'yeah', 'mean', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'as', 'far', 'sequels', 'go', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'career', 'was', 'floundering', 'point', 'had', 'great', 'success', 'then', 'movies', 'Sin', 'City', 'Domino', 'excellent', 'John', 'Simalar', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'play', 'Catherine', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'same', 'Rourke', 'John', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'essential', 'movie', 'one', 'collection', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'make', 'be.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

189514,A20NJAPECFGIR9,1573623857,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[4, 5]","It was sad to see how low Mickey Rourke had gotten when he made this mess. The first film wasn't anything spectacular but lucked up on being a hit. But a lot of  what made the first 9 1/2 Weeks a hit was missing and this film falls hard because of it.What Was Missing:1. Kim Basinger. Mickey Rourke might've been the one with the devious sexual appetite in the first movie but it was Basinger who kept you watching and who made the movie a hit. The moment this movie begins you miss the sultry, wide-eyed presence of the beautiful Basinger and her innocent portrayal of Elizabeth. Even though we expect her not to be in the movie, it's amazing how her absence takes such a toll. Without Kim this shouldn't have ever been made. Mickey couldn't hold the fire on his own and Angie Everhart cannot act nor can she hold a candle to Kim Basinger. She's as stiff and unimaginative as a mannequin that someone is controlling with a remote control. Who cast her? There had to be tons of more actresses that fit the role better but then again maybe they weren't desperate enough to take the role in this junk.2. ChemistryEverhart and Rourke have zero chemistry, non whatsoever. They are as exciting as two trees in the park. Their lines bounce off of each other with no passion, no feeling, no substance. The mood between them is stiffy and gloomy. Even Rourke looks like he's bored in the scenes with her. They were awful together. Rourke had more chemistry with Everhart's French assistant.3. Bad Sex ScenesThe so-called sex scenes in this film were so boring and lame I fast forwarded them. It's ridiculous when you don't see any excitement in a sex scene. This is what happens when people do not have chemistry. Basinger and Rourke sizzled on-screen. That's why the first movie was such a hit! They brought out the best in each other. For a movie whose first film set the stage for movies like Basic Instinct in terms of demented yet intriguing sex scenes, the ones in this film were indeed sad.4. The LocationNever thought Paris could be so boring. Everything was gray and dark. The characters all wore the same dark clothing, they all talked in the same boring monotone. Maybe if this had taken place on an island or in the US then it would've had more pop but the Paris scene made a boring movie even more dull.5. Lack of Character DevelopmentThe first film was shown through Basinger's point of view. So we get to know who she is very well and it's interesting to see the type of woman who'd fall for John's mind games. We see why Elizabeth's vulnerable to him because we get a glimpse into her life without John. Lea (Everhart) seems to have no life at all. She seems to only spring up when John needs someone to talk to. We never see her in her own point of view. We never get a sense of what type of person she is or what she expects from John. She also ruined it ""trying"" to be sexy. Basinger didn't have to try, she just was. On top of that, in this film Rourke is the innocent mouse and Everhart is the one with the savage sex drive. She turns the tables on him by putting him in some of the same types of situations he put Elizabeth in, and by baiting him. But it all comes off as too fake because of Everhart's overacting and underacting, as well as her trying to be so clever. Everhart stunk.I could go on and on but this is enough for you to see how bad this movie is. If you haven't seen it in all these years then by all means don't watch it now! Consider yourself lucky you weren't subjected to this.There was no point in this movie being made. Absolutely no point except to give a bunch of people paychecks. I've seen tons of horrible sequels but I think this is the worst ever.

189515,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,1573623857,Richard J. Brzostek,"[24, 26]","""Another 9 1/2 Weeks"" shows us what became of John (Mickey Rourke) and Elizabeth.  The sequel takes place about a decade after its first part where an older John Gray goes to Paris in search for clues to what became of the woman he fell in love with.  There, he meets Elizabeth's friend Lea who knows a lot about him - and still wants to be with him.  She wants excitement and thinks she just might even be too much for him.  So this time the game of cat and mouse is not one sided, as she has a wild side to match his to make some sparks fly.John isn't entirely the same man he once was, as his mind is still on his past.  He is man of remorse and was never the same after Elizabeth left him.  I found part of the storyline sad because he loved someone and knows she is gone from his life because of his own actions.  Part of him seemed to want to make the past live on, and it did in his thoughts, but they really tormented him.  This part of the story really struck a cord and made me reflect on my own life.John thinking of Elizabeth and Lea knowing about his past doesn't stop them from developing a strange romance.  She wants the thrills and dominating man she heard about.  ""Another 9 1/2 Weeks"" didn't have the same level of suspense as ""9 1/2 Weeks,"" but it definitely has some excitement and erotic moments like the first part.  It was a more somber film that gives some conclusion to what happened to that once passionate couple and how both their lives were never the same.  From there, this new romance leaves us with something to reflect on.",4,What became of John and Elizabeth,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,1556,"['9', '1/2', 'Weeks', 'became', 'John', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Elizabeth', 'sequel', 'place', 'decade', 'first', 'part', 'where', 'older', 'John', 'Gray', 'Paris', 'search', 'clues', 'what', 'became', 'woman', 'fell', 'love', 'Elizabeth', 'friend', 'Lea', 'who', 'lot', 'still', 'be', 'excitement', 'just', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'not', 'one', 'sided', 'wild', 'side', 'match', 'make', 'sparks', 'fly.John', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'same', 'man', 'once', 'was', 'mind', 'still', 'past', 'man', 'remorse', 'was', 'never', 'same', 'Elizabeth', 'left', 'found', 'part', 'storyline', 'sad', 'loved', 'someone', 'gone', 'life', 'own', 'actions', 'Part', 'seemed', 'want', 'make', 'past', 'live', 'did', 'thoughts', 'really', 'tormented', 'part', 'story', 'really', 'struck', 'cord', 'made', 'reflect', 'own', 'life.John', 'thinking', 'Elizabeth', 'Lea', 'knowing', 'past', ""n't"", 'stop', 'developing', 'strange', 'romance', 'thrills', 'dominating', 'man', 'heard', 'about', '9', '1/2', 'Weeks', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'level', 'suspense', '9', '1/2', 'Weeks', 'definitely', 'excitement', 'erotic', 'moments', 'first', 'part', 'was', 'more', 'somber', 'film', 'conclusion', 'what', 'happened', 'once', 'passionate', 'couple', 'how', 'lives', 'were', 'never', 'same', 'there', 'new', 'romance', 'something', 'reflect']",N/A

Sure if you compare it to the original the first gets the upper hand but there's something about it that I througherly enjoy. It has a good soundtrack, interesting and at times moody scenery, Mickey oozes sensuality and sex appeal. But what I find I think that makes the film  work is because of the casting of the always gorgeous, talented, interesting, charming, playful-Angie Everhart. I adore Angie, she really is a special lady. There's something fascinating about her.  Mickey and Angie have good chemistry together.I recommend at least a viewing of this film if one doesn't own this film already.By Justine Ryan",4,rourke and everhart steam up the screen,1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2003,654,"['really', '9', '1/2', 'Weeks', 'Sure', 'compare', 'original', 'first', 'upper', 'hand', 'something', 'througherly', 'enjoy', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'interesting', 'times', 'moody', 'scenery', 'Mickey', 'sensuality', 'sex', 'appeal', 'what', 'find', 'think', 'film', 'work', 'casting', 'always', 'gorgeous', 'talented', 'interesting', 'charming', 'playful-Angie', 'Everhart', 'adore', 'Angie', 'really', 'special', 'lady', 'something', 'fascinating', 'Mickey', 'Angie', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together.I', 'recommend', 'least', 'viewing', 'film', 'one', ""n't"", 'own', 'film', 'Justine', 'Ryan']",N/A
