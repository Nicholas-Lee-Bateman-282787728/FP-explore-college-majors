Wells' work.  A bit like Sherlock Holmes, probably same time period.  Fantastic, that is, fantasy, but told as if it could happen.  The production and sets and acting are all something along the classic BBC Sherlock Holmes work done with Jeremy Brett.  You don't have to have read Wells' work to enjoy these stories.  I am definitely pleased I bought this and would recommend it to anyone, really, I can't think of a reason to not buy it if you are inclined to this time period, to touch of sci-fi in that period, turn of the century, and you'll likely find the lead actor likable in the role.  When I see one story I go, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" and then the story is pursued, in the context of that day.  Very nicely done, no weak acting, no shabby sets, all professionally done with a nice tone of humor throughout.  It reminds me of what Star Trek would be if it was written 100 years ago, plausible stories that require some stretch of the imagination but, when portrayed, seem like they could have happened.  Then there's the human interaction, the drama, the story unfolds, and the impact on the characters.  I've only see 2 or 3 of the stories so far but look forward to watching the rest in future, God willing.  Watch out, everyone living back in that day is long deceased.  Why?

Of course being by Hallmark, don't expect any weighty themes here. The stories center around Wells, played by Tom Ward. Right off the bat I had an issue here- he looks like a young Jeremy Brett, and eschews Well's familiar mustache. Seems to me they could have made a better choice for the title character. All the other characters though are well played here. The settings look fantastic- they capture the feel of the late Victorian Era. However, some of the makeup- especially the ""old age"" makeup- doesn't look realistic. Back to the stories themselves- again they are based on some lesser known short stories by Wells, and they are very entertaining. The SPFX are convincing, and the the wrap-around story (a government agent is visiting an elderly Wells to get his input on some strange artifacts and files they have lying around) ties everything together nicely.

871180,A2LIA72DQFN9M0,B0006N2E8W,indijo,"[15, 15]","I never did see this when it was originally aired as a miniseries, and had no idea that it even existed until I did a search for ""H.G. Wells"" in the Dvd section at Amazon.com, and I really must say, it was one of those truly excellent rare finds that comes only once or twice a year at the most. I wasn't in the least bit sorry or disappointed that I ordered this Dvd; it was truly an excellent video adaption of some of H.G. Well's very best science-fiction short-stories.Tom Ward played a very good H.G. Wells, in his prime as an ambitious writer for a popular London publishing company (The Saturday Review) and also as the elderly Wells, being interviewed and sharing a review of the past with Eve Best, who plays a reporter but is also connected to the Ministry of Science and has a special interest in some of the speculative works of Wells. Katy Carmichael plays Jane Robbins, the college professor that Wells eventually married. Wells and Robbins are like a Victorian version of Mulder and Scully of the X Files, as together they investigate strange events and follow the stories to do their best to understand the scientific nature and get to the truth.The very first story is about strange events at the college where Jane herself works,  and introduces us to one of Well's most intelligent friends, a Professor Gibberne (Nicholas Rowe), after a spectrograph suddenly vanishes during an experiment and Wells is enlisted by Gibberne to investigate the case. The investigation leads them to another Professor, who has been conducting experiments with a powerful chemical, which they discover, accelerates the metabolism. The special effects for this particluar episode were state-of-the-art; perfect tri-dimensional stop-action scenes with Wells and Gibberne moving about within it all, while the rest of the world was completely frozen still.Each of the stories were interwoven by the personal lives shared by Wells and Robbins, as they became better acquainted with each other, taking lunch together and walks in the park. After Wells is kicked out of his ""Saturday Review"" publishing company office by the department editor, for turning in the story about the chemical accelerant instead of the romantic piece that was assigned to him,  he and Jane go out and about together looking for another story which he hopes will make up for the sudden set-back.What they found was perhaps even more fantastic than the episode about the accelerant, even though it also pertained to the relativity of time. In this case, however, it involved a paradoxical event that occurred after a subterranean power-line worker experienced a temporal displacement which put him back in time about a week. As time-travel stories go, this one wasn't all that different than others, as it gave the somewhat disillusioned man the opportunity to use his knowledge about the future to his advantage and also pointed out the dangers such manipulation of events could pose. But the really unique twist to this one was provided at the very end,  after the man handed Jane's book, detailing the entire story, to Wells in the tea shop, even though they themselves never recalled the experience, because it never actually occurred in the ""adjusted"" time-line.The next episode is somewhat reminiscent of ""War of the Worlds"", as it involves what might be considered one of the very first meteoric probes from Mars, which crashes somewhere in Northern Britain and is sold to a curios shop manager, to be sold as either a large, interesting paper-weight or whatever. Before it is sold, however, the manager studies it more closely and sees something, like a vision of another world, and an alien creature. When the man takes a drawing of the creature to Jane Robbins at the college, seeking to identify the species (Robbins is a biology professor), Wells shows up and takes a special interest in the case.Three other episodes include one about a man that experiences a temporary bipolar disorder after an accident involving a powerful electromagnet at the college, which puts him in a mental ward speaking about visions of being alone on an island somewhere at sea; another about an over-weight friend of Wells that becomes light as a feather on the wind after drinking a potion from a mysterious apothecary, and finally, an episode about a fan of Wells that uses him to get to Gibberne, solely for the purpose of stealing some of the experimental viral cultures Professor Gibberne has been storing, to be used as a weapon against the British government.This series is extremely well-done, an excellent adaption of the speculative science fiction of Wells. The Victorian era settings appear to be very authentic, the characters all quite believable, the effects at their best, and the fictional stories all very intriguing. Ward was excellent as Wells, Carmichael was a perfectly adorable supporting actress as Jane Robbins, the kind of strong, intelligent and attractive woman every man dreams about, and Rowe made a perfectly fun-loving zany Professor Gibberne.Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the complete series is the perspective from which it is presented from the beginning and throughout; the perspective of the elderly Wells telling each of the stories to the reporter Ellen McGillvray (Eve Best). This is most interesting because it adds to the ultimate mystery by presenting each of the stories as if they are actually true; as if they were, in fact, based upon very real events experienced by Wells and Robbins and their friends and associates in late Victorian England. This fact-based fiction angle is very well-done and intriguing, and to some extent, quite believable. While each story does seem quite fantastic, at the same time, anyone who knows what a truly mysterious and fantastic universe we live in, will also realize that there could be some genuine factual basis in reality for much of it.When one also considers how much of the 20th century history H.G. Wells foresaw and predicted, and how much more was opened up by the relativity theory of Einstein, The Infinite Worlds of H.G. Wells is a wonderful source of intelligent speculation as well as a reminder of how much more is possible beyond the tedious, monotonous and mundane reality so many of us find ourselves confined within, in the much more complicated beginning of the 21st century.",5,Excellent video adaption of  H.G.

One of the stories took place in England, i believe, and it was about young scientists and brilliant young minds in college.  Basically, one of the young men stumbled upon a time serum through chemistry. He was perfecting it to a point where you can go back and forth through time.  It helped him stay a step ahead of all his other collegues and impress a special young lady he was dating.There was a glitch in the experiment. Meaning he didnt do enough research to understand the side effects to what would or COULD happen with continuous use of this potion. The main focus was to speed up and low down a human's molecules to a point where you could be moving at an accelerated rate, while everyone else stayed at an average rate, and thus speed up time, but eventually you would return BACK to your correct moment in time, with the knowledge you acquired when you were AHEAD in time.  So 30 years, to you, could be like a blink of an eye, but to everyone else, they were still moving at regular speed.  During the time you were on the potion, 30 years would go by and you would have done 30 years worth of reasearch and return knowing 30 YEARS worth of knowledge.What happened was, eventually, He used it so much, that NOTHING slowed his cells and molecules back down, he was just constantly living in an accelerated state, in an accelerated world, where all life around him, was PAUSED. He could no longer feel another humans touch, or love, or conversation.  His energy vibrations where moving at such a fast rate that noone would hear or feel him anyway. He grew old and died an old man. HE WAS A YOUNG, old man. He learned about the side effects too late, meaning, it actually took him 30 years to understand how the potion worked, to figure out all the scientific details, chemically, and to perfect the formula. This concept blew my mind and actually disturbed me.

Unlike Hallmark's more famous works such as Merlin, Helen of Troy, Gulliver's Travels, and the 10th Kingdom, this one was not an adaptation of a fairy tale, myth, children's book, or a remake of some other movie.  Instead, this is a highly original synthesis of multiple works by H.G. Wells, such as The Time Machine and War of the Worlds.The story is told in flashback.  An old H.G. Wells in retirement is approached by a lady working for the English government but posing as a journalist.  She proceeds to ask him questions about his past.  Each question is answered in a flashback by Wells.  These flashback periods occur around the end of the 19th century, and each one involves something paranormal, fantastical or extraterrestrial.  It is these components of the flashbacks that make the show part fantasy, and part science fiction.  Each flashback also alludes to one of the books authored by the real H.G. Wells, many of which are mentioned in this movie.The overall pace of the movie is slow and deliberate, such that the fantasy / sci-fi parts of the story are not the central theme.  Instead, it is the romance between Wells and his fictional love interest played by the beautiful Katy Carmichael.  The theme music, and the realistic dialogue adds to the slow pace.  My only complaint about the movie was the lack of English subtitles.  The movie is set in England, so the accents are very thick, which makes it somewhat difficult for an American to understand some of the dialogue.",4,Very good work by Hallmark,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,1564,"['Unknown', 'most', 'viewers', '4+', 'hour', 'long', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'Hallmark', 'Unlike', 'Hallmark', 'more', 'famous', 'works', 'such', 'Merlin', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'Gulliver', 'Travels', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'adaptation', 'fairy', 'tale', 'myth', 'children', 'book', 'remake', 'other', 'movie', 'Instead', 'highly', 'original', 'synthesis', 'multiple', 'works', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'such', 'Time', 'Machine', 'War', 'Worlds.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'old', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'retirement', 'approached', 'lady', 'working', 'English', 'government', 'posing', 'journalist', 'ask', 'questions', 'past', 'question', 'answered', 'flashback', 'Wells', 'flashback', 'periods', 'occur', 'end', '19th', 'century', 'one', 'something', 'paranormal', 'fantastical', 'extraterrestrial', 'components', 'flashbacks', 'make', 'show', 'part', 'fantasy', 'part', 'science', 'fiction', 'flashback', 'also', 'one', 'books', 'authored', 'real', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'many', 'are', 'mentioned', 'movie.The', 'overall', 'pace', 'movie', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'such', 'fantasy', '/', 'sci-fi', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'central', 'theme', 'Instead', 'romance', 'Wells', 'fictional', 'love', 'interest', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Katy', 'Carmichael', 'theme', 'music', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'slow', 'pace', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', 'was', 'lack', 'English', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'set', 'England', 'accents', 'are', 'very', 'thick', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'American', 'understand', 'dialogue']",N/A

Wells (Time Machine, War of the Worlds, etc.) in both literal and film adaptations, and the idea that Wells got his ideas from real life is not new (note the film Time After TimeTime After Time).Hallmark made several episodes of the Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells, and though I don't want to outline each episode, the running themes of his works being based on real events was well done, as well as love story running throughout the story makes it fun and interesting.  Amy (Jane) Robbins and Wells partner up in investigating various rumors and finding unusual goings on.One episode has a man who wanted to lose weight.  He ends up being light as a feather, floating around the room.  His unrequited love for a girl named Violet was touching.  Another man has an accident and ends up one week in the future and bounces back again.  With his Racing Forum News he tries to clean up but at what cost?  Another is a meteor that is the gateway to another world, the inspiration apparently for War of the Worlds.Another thread that keeps this anthology together is the woman he confides these stories - Ellen who at first proclaims herself to a be journalist who wants to interview Wells yet is really part of a government organization investing phenomena that Wells had been a part of.  Interesting how Wells warms up to her, during post-war England.Overall a great little series, originally produced in 2001.  The DVD itself is unremarkable, with only scene selections to keep you going.Series Directed byRobert YoungSeries CastTom Ward - H. G.
