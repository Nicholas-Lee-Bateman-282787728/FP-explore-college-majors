I understand now this is a ""Made for TV Movie"" which explains the poor script, acting and the lack of realism.  One thing is far to real, the family of the girl in the movie.  They remind me of my country in-laws who never thought I was any good since I didn't hunt, fish, drive a pick up truck, get drunk and have sex with anyone I could and then go to church on Sunday so I could get through the pearly gates of glory.This movie attempts to make life in a small hick town wonderful.  The city boyfriend makes the mistake of being educated, flaunting tradition and using his vocabulary.  Once he saves his future father-in-law's life he is acceptable (only because he shot and killed a wolf) and he is won over to the hick town his girl wants to live in to be with her family.The action is supposed to take place in a beautiful landscape, but either the producers were too frugal or the photography sucks because this is not evident.On some day when I don't like the human race I will donate this to the library.

But for me there was a lack of chemistry between the two leads, and I couldn't muster any sympathy for the leading man.

The characters didn't come to life for me and some ""locals"" were portrayed more as caricature than characters--maybe that was for comic effect.The setting is a nice change of pace from many others of its genre--a cattle ranch, rather than a small town with a Christmasy name, or a city with two busy people who find each other. There are no ""single-parents-dating-the-wrong-people"" that seem to be in so many Christmas chick-flicks, so there is some originality to the storyline.I will probably watch this again (during an all-night gift wrapping session) but it won't be a top pick.

She wants him to meet her father, brothers and see the place where she was raised, so they head to her family's ranch for Christmas. The rest is a bunch of unbelievable male posturing, stilted dialog, impossibly contrived circumstances and two-dimensional characters. That said, I enjoyed this made-for-TV movie. Why? I've narrowed it down to the light-handed way Christmas was blended into the film. There are some decorations here and there, and sporadic mention of the holidays but the main focus is not about gifts and a big feast, it is about the family and their relationships. The true star of the film, and perhaps what held my interest throughout, is the beautiful scenery. The mountains are absolutely gorgeous and the rural setting transported me from my world into their's even though the story is weak and characters largely unsympathetic.Regarding the bonus Christmas CD included with the movie -- A Romantic Christmas -- it is all instrumental and muzak-like in style. It is background music, nothing anyone would focus on and thus is perfect to play during a meal or while gift wrapping or visiting with friends. The inclusion of The Chanukah Song on the ""A Romantic Christmas"" CD is an interesting choice.
