Knowing how the characters' lives have progressed, it is fun to go back and rewatch the early shows. And Sealy Booth is always enjoyable to look at! Zach, who no longer appears, having become involved with a canabalistic serial killer, is not in newer seasons, but those of us who loved him can still see him here.",5,Past seasons at your fingerfips,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,429,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'are', 'fan', 'Bones', 'TV', 'here', 'are', 'are', 'past', 'seasons', 'available', 'veiwing', 'leisure', 'Knowing', 'how', 'characters', 'lives', 'have', 'progressed', 'fun', 'go', 'back', 'rewatch', 'early', 'shows', 'Sealy', 'Booth', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'look', 'Zach', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'having', 'become', 'involved', 'canabalistic', 'serial', 'killer', 'not', 'newer', 'seasons', 'who', 'loved', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'here']",N/A
1384864,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B004477V7U,Kevin J. Loria,"[1, 6]","I am of two schools of thought on this series... 1) Bones is a not so undercover Vulcan denying her emotions while exploring the human condition, 2.) She is a Replicant and as an android, only thinks she is denying those emotions ... Which ever you embrace determines your take on Booth's intent to either turn the Vulcan Doctor into a vampire or retire the Skin-job... Because sometimes Blade Runners retire Vulcans by mistake.. And tryin' to turn an android into a vamp would just be silly.Seriously it's an awesome and quirky take on the whole morgue genre.",5,The Vampire & the Vulcan,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,560,"['am', 'two', 'schools', 'thought', 'series', '1', 'Bones', 'not', 'so', 'undercover', 'Vulcan', 'denying', 'emotions', 'exploring', 'human', 'condition', '2', 'Replicant', 'android', 'only', 'denying', 'emotions', 'Which', 'ever', 'embrace', 'determines', 'take', 'Booth', 'intent', 'turn', 'Vulcan', 'Doctor', 'vampire', 'retire', 'Skin-job', 'sometimes', 'Blade', 'Runners', 'retire', 'Vulcans', 'mistake..', 'tryin', 'turn', 'android', 'vamp', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'silly.Seriously', 'awesome', 'quirky', 'take', 'whole', 'morgue', 'genre']",N/A

I'm a pretty big fan of this show, and had initially purchased all 5 currently available seasons individually. I was really irritated that season 1 was on double sided discs, so when I saw this box set, I had to pounce. I must say that I'm a bit disappointed. I was hoping that season 1 would be re-issued on single sided discs, similar to what happened when the House season 1-5 box set was released. Either the market place seller I bought from isn't selling an authentic version of this Bones box-set, or this is the crappiest release ever. It is identical to the 5 individual seasons I already owned; no matching cases for each season or anything. I wonder if I would have received a different product if I would have bought directly from amazon. If anyone has any insite regarding this matter, I would really appreciate it.So, five stars for the show, but one star for this seasons 1-5 box set, assuming, of course that I got the legitimate product.",3,not quite what I was hoping for,1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,1107,"['normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'reviews', 'rate', 'seller', 'instead', 'product', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'best', 'ask', 'question', 'apart', 'reviewing', 'product', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'had', 'initially', 'purchased', '5', 'currently', 'available', 'seasons', 'individually', 'was', 'really', 'irritated', 'season', '1', 'was', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'when', 'saw', 'box', 'set', 'had', 'pounce', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'bit', 'disappointed', 'was', 'hoping', 'season', '1', 'would', 'be', 're-issued', 'single', 'sided', 'discs', 'similar', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'House', 'season', '1-5', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'released', 'market', 'place', 'seller', 'bought', ""n't"", 'selling', 'authentic', 'version', 'Bones', 'box-set', 'crappiest', 'release', 'ever', 'identical', '5', 'individual', 'seasons', 'already', 'owned', 'matching', 'cases', 'season', 'anything', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'different', 'product', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'directly', 'amazon', 'anyone', 'insite', 'regarding', 'matter', 'would', 'really', 'appreciate', 'it.So', 'five', 'stars', 'show', 'one', 'star', 'seasons', '1-5', 'box', 'set', 'assuming', 'course', 'got', 'legitimate', 'product']",N/A
