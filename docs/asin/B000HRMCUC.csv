The trailer is perfect high definition, a reason to spend too much money on a good TV.  The colors are as bright and fresh as the image is detailed.  The closest I have yet seen to the 'looking through a window' effect.  Stunning, absolutely stunning.  So what a shock when I started watching the Blu-ray disc.  Don't get me wrong, it's good, very good, but not anywhere in the same league as the trailer.  I then watched a clip from the trailer and found the matching clip in the film; night and day.  The film has a slight haze of grain jumping pixels throughout, the trailer has none.  Colors are subdued, no, the colors are burnt and crushed in this film when compared to the trailer.  The whole movie was shot digitally so what happened.  If you like Click the Blu-ray disc is going to be better than the DVD, even the special features are in high definition.

1015633,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,B000HRMCUC,"Amazon Customer ""MRD""","[3, 4]","As is often the case these days, movies like CLICK are often promoted in ad spots by using some of their funniest bits.  If one watches the trailer for this movie one would assume that the plot would be rife with the usual predictable, though funny, stuff: stop-action with Adam Sandler making adjustments to achieve the usual mischief.  Unfortunately the best shtick is wasted in the promos.What actually emerges is a very interesting and serious movie about a man who, wanting to adjust his reality, discovers that things as they are aren't really that bad.  Christopher Walken plays an angel that shows the facts to Sandler's character.  What if things were different? What if you could fast forward through the bad and keep the good?  What if, what if, what if.  Sounds pretty good on the surface.But then something, in my opinion, goes decidedly wrong.  The writers and director decide to pack the film with a bunch of crude and disjointed jokes and themes that keep getting in the way.  Dogs humping legs and stuffed animals and each other may be funny once in a while but when the over-amorous canines go at it again and again and again...well...what the viewer gets is a boring, perverse ""fake-fingernail-in-the-hamburger"" experience that really gets in the way. And the canine crazies are the very least of the problems here.  There are plenty of tasteless human anatomical and sexual situations to give the dogs a solid run for the money.The story is wonderful and has a great message but it gets bogged down over and over by the unnecessary nonsense thrown in seemingly because we, the viewers, wouldn't want to see Sandler in a serious role.If you can find this one in some edited form, with all the crude and rude stuff appropriately excised do it.  Otherwise be prepared to wade through a lot of stuff that dilutes and diminishes the beauty of the story. Three stars (and that's being very generous) for the good that's there.THE HORSEMAN",3,MR.

Just slightly below these in quality areFUNNY PEOPLE(2009) and CLICK.This is a modern entry in a genre that was quite popular in the 1930s-40s, the angel/devil/spirit fantasy. Here, Sandler (as Michael Newman) is given a universal remote from an eccentric salesman named Morty (Walken). The device allows Michael to replay his past or fast forward over unpleasant moments in his daily life. What he's not aware of is that in doing so one time, the remote automatically skips any similar events. Michael can't stop this from occurring. His life races by as a result and he never experiences more than disjointed episodes of it. (A later consultation with Morty reveals who he really is but doesn't resolve the remote control issue.)Sandler and the other main cast members do a fine job (watch for a riotous Rob Schneider cameo as Prince Habeeboo). The only flaw perhaps is an ending copout. The story very easily could've concluded darkly and actually had until a dreaded deus ex machina was pulled out of the cobwebbed clich&eacute; bag for your happily-ever-after ta da.

Sure, his characters are slightly repetitive(every role he seems to have to get revenge on some shmucks for messing with his lifestyle).  But, I cannot deny the comical and dramatic greatness of this film.  It is one of if not the best film of the summer thus far.  I am not Sandler's biggest fan, but a few of his films have made it to the top shelf of my movie cabinet.  And, when this reaches DVD, it will join that number(when the saints go marching in--everyone now...). Full of laughs and tears(surprisingly good tear-jerking moments), Click is definitely worth repeated viewing/visits.Additionally, I would add that Christopher Walken's character is a bit confusing during the film, and I wasn't sure how to rate his performance.  Kate Beckinsale is just absolutely dreamy even with an American accent(even if her role is ordinary or sub-par, she can't do much wrong looking so good&lt;smiles>).  There is one minor character that is a little disturbing/questionable at the Bed, Bath and Beyond store(for those who have seen the movie, you know who I mean).  And, the young ""bully"" of the film takes a page from the toy-melting psycho-kid from Toy Story.  Henry W's portrayal of Sandler's dad is touching though still semi-typical.  Perhaps the best line of the film is when Sandler flashes back to his first kiss with Beckinsale.

1015640,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000HRMCUC,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Like many movie watchers, I have mixed feelings with Adam Sandler as an actor.  Sometimes he's funny, other times he comes across rather obnoxious and annoying.  However for Click he clicks (hehe).  I'm surprised how the pacing of this movie gradually shifts from several over the top comedy segments into a more emotionally devastating sad tone by the conclusion.  The transition is actually amazingly well-executedSo, what's the storyline about?  When Adam Sandler accidentally stumbles upon a mysterious angel of death (Christopher Walken's character) Adam is given a remote device that can alter time in several different ways.  For the most part Adam uses the remote to go into the future and skip over all the family-related annoying aspects of his life that gives him the biggest annoyances (such as his EXTREMELY HOT WIFE (played by Kim Beckinsale) nagging at him to do his chores to name one example).  There's quite a bit of depth to Adam's family which is respectable.  It proves a fair amount of time was devoted to this movie.  I do recall a certain period in 2006 when the hype for Click was pretty high.Later on Adam realizes he can use the remote device to not only skip past the events he doesn't care for but also freeze time, eavesdrop into other peoples conversations and alter the size and shape of his face as well as his boss's body size (played by David Hasselhoff).  Admittedly it gets a bit silly by this point but please, keep watching!!  By the way it's somewhat funny seeing David Hasselhoff play a serious character after a certain hamburger incident he went through a while back.  I haven't seen him play such a role since Knight Rider!Anyway, you're probably wondering how it's possible that with all this skipping into the future chaos and Adam's often overbearing obsession fiddling with his time-travelling remote, how the storyline can possibly become emotional?  It's when Adam realizes that he's skipping ahead TOO much and missing key elements of his family's life.  He realizes he's spending too much time with his work and not enough time with his family.  This is when the storyline changes dramatically.  Like I said above though, it's a natural transition from comedy into seriousness, and trust me, Adam actually comes across convincingly in a serious role.  I know, usually he fails in that regard.By the way there's a Michael Jackson joke that's sort of eerie given the circumstances of his death a few years after this movies release.  Also, the dog humping segments were overkill and unnecessary.  Basically it's a time travelling movie, and one that succeeds in my book.  I know it's really easy to dismiss Adam Sandler as an overrated goofball, but in this one, his performance is actually pretty good so it's highly recommended that you watch it.",5,surprisingly funny,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,2798,"['many', 'movie', 'watchers', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'actor', 'funny', 'other', 'times', 'rather', 'obnoxious', 'annoying', 'However', 'Click', 'hehe', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'pacing', 'movie', 'gradually', 'several', 'top', 'comedy', 'segments', 'more', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'sad', 'tone', 'conclusion', 'transition', 'actually', 'amazingly', 'well-executedSo', 'what', 'storyline', 'When', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'accidentally', 'mysterious', 'angel', 'death', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'character', 'Adam', 'given', 'remote', 'device', 'can', 'alter', 'time', 'several', 'different', 'ways', 'most', 'part', 'Adam', 'remote', 'go', 'future', 'skip', 'family-related', 'annoying', 'aspects', 'life', 'biggest', 'annoyances', 'such', 'EXTREMELY', 'HOT', 'WIFE', 'played', 'Kim', 'Beckinsale', 'nagging', 'do', 'chores', 'name', 'one', 'example', 'quite', 'bit', 'depth', 'Adam', 'family', 'respectable', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'movie', 'do', 'recall', 'certain', 'period', '2006', 'when', 'hype', 'Click', 'was', 'pretty', 'high.Later', 'Adam', 'can', 'use', 'remote', 'device', 'not', 'only', 'skip', 'events', ""n't"", 'care', 'also', 'freeze', 'time', 'eavesdrop', 'other', 'peoples', 'conversations', 'alter', 'size', 'shape', 'face', 'as', 'well', 'boss', 'body', 'size', 'played', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'Admittedly', 'bit', 'silly', 'point', 'please', 'keep', 'watching', 'way', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'seeing', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'play', 'serious', 'character', 'certain', 'hamburger', 'incident', 'went', 'while', 'back', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'play', 'role', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'Anyway', ""'re"", 'probably', 'wondering', 'how', 'possible', 'skipping', 'future', 'chaos', 'Adam', 'often', 'overbearing', 'obsession', 'fiddling', 'time-travelling', 'remote', 'how', 'storyline', 'can', 'possibly', 'become', 'emotional', 'when', 'Adam', 'skipping', 'ahead', 'TOO', 'much', 'missing', 'key', 'elements', 'family', 'life', 'spending', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'work', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'family', 'when', 'storyline', 'changes', 'dramatically', 'said', 'natural', 'transition', 'comedy', 'seriousness', 'trust', 'Adam', 'actually', 'convincingly', 'serious', 'role', 'know', 'usually', 'regard.By', 'way', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'joke', 'sort', 'eerie', 'given', 'circumstances', 'death', 'few', 'years', 'movies', 'release', 'Also', 'dog', 'humping', 'segments', 'were', 'overkill', 'unnecessary', 'Basically', 'time', 'travelling', 'movie', 'one', 'book', 'know', 'really', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'overrated', 'goofball', 'one', 'performance', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'highly', 'recommended', 'watch']",N/A

That means it displays his trademark humor, and is full of wacky secondary characters.  I had to watch this movie over two nights, and after the first night (about 45 minutes), I thought, this is a good, funny movie.  The conflict had been set up.  Sandler plays an overworked dad who hardly has time to spend with his wife or kids.  One night, he goes to by a universal remote.  He comes home with a remote that not only works on his television, but his life.  He can fast forward through traffic jams, pause other character, or mute his nagging wife.Sandler is having fun trying out his new product.  I resumed the movie the next night, and the movie immediately became tedious and boring.  The plot is basically a take on the Christmas Carol, but instead of ghosts of Christmas pasts, you have a remote that takes you to what your life could be like if you don't change.  So, the last half of the movie shows Sandler neglecting his wife and kids and lamenting the fact that he can't change anything because of the out of control remote control.The supporting cast is a highlight of the movie.  Christopher Walken is quirky and funny.  Kate Beckinsale is beautiful, but not much else.  Sean Astin and Rob Schneider each have their moments, as does David Hasslehoff.I think this movie might have had a lot of potential, but somewhere along the line it went astray of original comedy.  This movie is full of sexual innuendo and bad language and the PG 13 rating should not be ignored.

The blatant parallels to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE are transparent, but that's not what makes Click a clunker. Not that it is a clunker in its entirety, either.The story surrounds Michael Newman (Adam Sandler, WATERBOY), an architect who yearns for peace and harmony in his life. Part of the problem is the competition (keeping up with the Jones') that he has going on with his neighbors. They have a new RV, new toys and new cars, while Michael and his family just get by. One evening he hears the irritating boy next door talking about his father's new universal remote control that's patched into everything (garage door, TV, stereo, etc.) and it's all that Michael can take. So he heads out to the mall and stops at (of all places) Bed, Bath and Beyond. It is the ""Beyond"" that apparently pulls him in, but once inside all he finds are towels and bedding. He lays down on one of these and then quickly spots a doorway that says ""Beyond"". It looks rather ethereal yet inviting, so Michael goes on in. What he finds is a whacked out looking guy named Morty (Christopher Walken) who offers him a truly ""Universal Remote."" This remote control does it all. It can rewind you to your birth so that you can witness it (or your conception, something we should NEVER have to see), or it can fast-forward you through troubling times, like arguments with your spouse or personal illnesses. The dangers of this Universal Remote aren't evident right away. Apparently, as this magical tool gets used to your requests, it does them automatically for you, without you having to push a button. So when Michael fast forwards through arguments with his wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale), the remote does it automatically for him in the future. Thus, large chunks of what might seem like inane discussions suddenly are wiped away.Michael soon discovers that his life is in constant fast forward. His job, his kids, his wife, even his own body, change in rapid succession as the Universal Remote takes over. Trying to give back this dangerous piece of machinery, we soon learn that Morty is much more than he seems.The great thing about the film is the last 2/3 of it (with the exception of the ending, which we'll cover in a moment). When people learn how important life is, it's truly an eye-opener. And this is where Click succeeds. When Sandler's character learns about death and how important it is to live every second of every day, it is heart renderingly pulled off. We get to witness Sandler rewinding time and again the important portions of his life that he missed. And, near the end of his own life, we witness his evolution into a man of distinction, trying to save his son from his own deadly mistakes related to family.Where the film fails is the beginning and it's horribly cliched ending. The beginning of the film is filled with bathroom humor (farting in people's faces) and gag jokes that sag under their own terrible weight. This is where one feels like they are watching an entirely different film when compared to the latter 2/3 of the movie. The characters are one-dimensional and utterly unbelievable (quite the dichotomy from what we see later). This isn't a character evolution issue as much as a script failure.The ending of the film is what finally gives it a poor rating. When we see Sandler lay down at Bed, Bath and Beyond, a creeping disgust enters the mind. The film-makers surely wouldn't use one of the oldest cliches in the book, would they? But, oh yes, they did. Grrr!The unfortunate thing about Click is that it really has a wonderful message and some fine acting moments. Special effect make-up artist Rick Baker also deserves much credit for the aging looks he puts the characters through, from Henry Winkler's role as Sandler's father, to Sean Astin's speedo and chubby swim instructor, it was one of the strongest aspects of the entire production.As a whole, the film fails because of its childish beginnings and over-used style ending. But make no mistake, there are some great moments in here.

The movies are totally different. This movie starts out as a comedy but then becomes darker as the drama kicks in on how life passes us by if we dont' take the time to embrace it. To many double income families know only full well the difficulties in balancing careers and family. Adam Sandler fans should definitely like it, especially if they enjoyed the less light ""50 First Dates"". Sandler likes to poke some fun and try to show us to appreciate our loved ones and friends.In ""Click"" he plays an overworked architect that finds it hard to keep up with his job and still find time for his family. When he can't even figure out what controls the TV, fan, or garage door opener he visits Bed, Bath, and Beyond. When he finds there is much more to the place than meets the eye he finds that an angel played by Christopher Walken has the solution to all his problems. A remote that controls his universe. Only one problem, the remote is a smart remote and remembers his choices so that it may automatically make them again. I'm a fan of Adam Sandler, so I enjoyed the movie.

Not only is Adam Sandler great, but so is Christopher Walkin, who plays the guy who gives Adam Sandler this remote. Alright, let me brief you about this Blockbuster flick.A guy who is down on his luck go to ""Bed, Bath, and Beyond."" There he goes to the way beyond section of the store, where he meets the creator of the universal remote control (played by Christopher Walkin) that is a remote control not just for electronics, but for everyday life. With this remote, one could mute sound entirely, skip a part of life (such as, let's say you are in high school. Every time it was test time, the remote would skip it for you. How it skipped it, I am not saying). All in all, it is about one lucky dude who found a very powerful remote (he got it for FREE).So, get this film. You will not be disappointed, that is if you like Adam Sandler or if you just plain like comedy for comedy's sake.

1015654,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000HRMCUC,Chris Kennison,"[0, 1]","Oh, it's good natured fun, but if you're looking for something more, beware.CLICK is about a businessman named Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) who has his priorities a little out of order. Too often, work comes before anything else in his life. So, stressed out and faced with 8 or 9 remote controls in his living room, he makes a trip to Bed, Bath & Beyond (a product placement that probably paid for the entire shoot) for a univeral remote. There, he meets up with Morty (Christopher Walken) in the Beyond section, who gives him more than he bargained for... a remote control that will change his life.That's where the movie sort of moves into the realm of silliness. With the remote, he can fast forward life, skip unpleasant things, pause to think about things, put things in slow motion etc. Many of the antics are very funny, and some are questionable... why would anybody fast forward through sex with Kate Beckinsale???Where IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE had a wholesome quality to it, CLICK loses its wholesomeness in many Sandlerish sequences... like the slow motion jogger with the bouncing assets, or the depantsing, or the nut-kicking etc. At times, the remote control theme gets a little ridiculous.But then... the movie turns a corner into the redeemable. The movie finishes with some emotional moments that effectively tug the heartstrings and give the movie weight.Ultimately, CLICK is a good movie. Some jokes work. Some don't. So, like I said, as long as you're not looking for something as unforgettable, timeless and world changing as IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was, then CLICK may not disappoint you, because it isn't unforgettable, timeless or world changing.

But at least he has played some likable characters in previous films such as ""Big Daddy"" and ""Spanglish"". Here he plays a truly miserable jerk named Michael Newman. Michael is a workoholic architect who ignores his family while pursuing career advancement. He manages to come in possession of a ""universal remote control"" which allows him to fast forward through his every day life directly to the big promotion he is aiming for at work. Later the remote control begins to operate automatically and Michael comes to regret all the years he has wasted.This film obviously is attempting to imitate ""It's A Wonderful Life"". But any serious comparision would be an insult to Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. This is because while that all time classic had heart and charm, ""Click"" is basically a series of crude jokes, racist stereotypes and product placement for big corporations. Truly it's the epitome of low brow Hollywood mediocrity and it is beyond me how anyone over age 12 could find this junk funny. I must admit I actually liked the central idea - that life is be appreciated on a daily basis rather than always wanting to ""fast forward"" towards future goals.This is something that I have to remind myself of on a regular basis.

He has strayed from the world of stoner comedy and is trying to win our hearts, he must be stopped. I am not implying that this film does not have a good premise, nor am I saying that it does not have potential, but I am saying that it has heart.The picture is about an overworked architect named Michael Newman that cannot get a hold of his life. Whatever Michael does, it ends up making someone upset and it usually ends up being his hot wife and two children. Newman becomes frustrated that his life is not perfect, even though he has a nice house, a good job and a loving family. He gets angry because his neighbor has everything that he dreams of, and when Newman gets close his neighbor just gets more useless crap. One of these things is a universal remote control that takes care of all household uses, instead of using multiple remotes for the garage, television, and remote control cars. Newman goes to Bed Bath and Beyond and in a campy attempt at a joke there is a section called way beyond that has a scientist named Morty in it played by Christopher Walken. The rest of the plot goes without saying if you have even glanced at the previews.The first thirty to forty five minutes are pretty funny. Sandler is his usual obnoxious humorous self making fun of small children and desperate housewives. The jokes in the beginning are non stop up, until the comedy turns into a drama and they try to pull the strings on our hearts. The jokes become few and far between and not many of them hit after a while. The end is predictable and heartwarming.One thing I thought was interesting; the name of the nasty next door neighbor boy is O'Doyle.

1015658,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000HRMCUC,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","Personally, romantic comedies are critic-proof: you're not supposed to see some big character study epic a la films by Spielberg or Scorsese. What you're ultimately there to see is ""was the film funny?"" So do you mind that the same concept was used for Bruce Almighty? I didn't. I saw it for one reason: I want to laugh, and I will admit that I did on a few parts. But then there will be parts that just simply didn't fit or came out of left field and it becomes just a generic comedy with a few bright spots.Michael Newman(Adam Sandler) is a young architect who's being overworked by his demanding boss(David Hasselhoff in another ""so bad it's funny"" roles). He cancels camping trips, forgets events with his kids and unbelievably, can't figure out what remote controls what. So he decides to get a universal remote but thanks to Morty, a quirky salesman(a delightful Christopher Walken), he now has a remote control that actually controls life itself. Dog's too loud? Mute it. Fight with the missus? Skip it. Feel like hitting your boss? Pause it and wail on him. Only, of course, the remote is ""special"" so it remembers Michael's attitude towards certain events and skips them without warning. Pretty soon he skips entire sections of his life and trying to figure out how to save his life while it's passing by.Now for some good: the casting. Kate Beckinsale is just simply lovely, being a charming wife and still having some spunk and not that ""ball and chain"" feeling. And of course Chris Walken who acts like he knows it's a terrible movie and decides to just go with it. And Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner are memorable but their roles are just too small. As for Adam Sandler, well...it's kind of like a more tamer version of other comedy roles he's done but he still manages to go for kids swearing and a very horny dog with a thing for a plush duck doll. He kind of works but then he doesn't.The film's tone is probably its biggest problem. Some of the laughs do work such as life based on a DVD menu complete with audio commentary by none other than James Earl Jones. Or when he decides to change his skin color from Hulk green to Barney purple. But other jokes such as farting, the aforementioned kid profanity or ""kid getting hit by"" jokes don't tend to work. Then the film becomes a complete morality play and we see Michael in the future reacting to missing chunks of his life and it becomes more drama than anything.

My only complaint is that it certainly isn't ""family fare"" for a nice story and should have been rated ""R,"" not PG-13. There's simply too much sexual material (and and f-word) for PG-13. With some editing, this could have been a great story for everyone.However, for us adults who like to laugh, there is plenty in here to do that. The jokes come pretty fast, right from the get-go. The premise would good: with a (television-like) remote control, you could control your life. You could fast-forward through all the unpleasant scenes in your life, or freeze frame something that is happening now, or you could go back into time with your life. It all sounds good, but as our main character ""Michael Newman"" (Adam Sandler) found out, it's not so cool. That's a key message here, too, that avoiding the bad things is not necessarily what's best for us. The major message, however, was that spending time with your family is more important than putting your job ahead of them, as far as priorities go.That theme leads to some touching scenes in the final 30 minutes of this comedy.

1015663,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B000HRMCUC,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[3, 3]","""Click"" is an enjoyable movie that follows no real pattern of expectations.  I rate a movie by how predictable or unpredictable it is.  And that's ""Click""'s strongest point.  I don't believe people saw where this movie was taking us.Yes, there is a bit of bathroom (just not in the bathroom) type comedy that really didn't need to be in the movie.  I don't find dogs humping a stuffed toy duck nearly as funny as Adam Sandler must.  But if I overlook that little flaw, I think ""Click"" is Sandler's best movie to date.I know I feel like there is not enough time in the day to accomplish what should be done each day, so I completely understand how Sandler's character would be thrilled to be able to take control of his life using a super-remote-controller, given to him by Morty (Christopher Walken) in the Beyond section of Bed, Bath, and Beyond store.  That part alone was completely hilarious!Michael Newman (Sandler's character) lives next door to a family who always has the best of everything, and I really loved how Sandler and the writers included the annoying brat Kevin O'Doyle (played by Cameron Monaghan) into the mix.  His rants and raves about his family's luxuries, and Newman's comebacks, added some good filler to this movie.  People in the audience cheered when the little brat finally got what he had coming.  That means ya did good Monaghan, ya got people to really hate you!Kate Beckinsale is amazing in this production, landing her role at every opportunity given.  This woman is one of the best actresses in Hollywood.  Playing the role of a wife whose husband seems to be losing his mind, not to mention his family, cannot be an easy part, yet Beckinsale does it to perfection.  If you haven't seen her in Underworld or Underworld: Evolution, I suggest you check those movies out as well.Christopher Walken (Morty) is always a joy to watch on screen, and while this role doesn't really let him shine, he does manage to turn in a performance that delivers some of his famous facial quirks that just make ya wonder if he's not really just a little insane in real life.  Walken is a genius, like James Woods, even if the younger generation can't see it.David Hasselhoff (Newman's Boss, Ammer) is the one weak link in this film.  I wouldn't even let this guy get through an audition for a high school play casting mimes.  Hasselhoff may be one of the worst actors of all times!  I can't believe I used to watch Knight Rider as a kid.  I was young and dumb back then, so please forgive me.I absolutely loved Henry Winkler's role in this film!  Talk about a realistic, witty, and gutsy performance, this is it.  Just like James Garner nailed his role in The Notebook, Winkler may have turned in his best movie performance to date.""Click"" is a combination of the old Adam Sandler (silly kid jokes) and the new Adam Sandler (acting gone good).  It is a movie that has the viewer laughing pretty hard one minute and in tears the next.  It is a movie that is unpredictable and fun.

1015664,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000HRMCUC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 1]","Among life's few remaining constants is this one: Adam Sandler makes good, entertaining movies.  Some of them might be mindless and juvenile, but they are all fun to watch - and I happen to think that Sandler has evolved into a pretty decent actor.  I must admit, though, that I wasn't all that excited about seeing Click (they must not have had much of Kate Beckinsale in the previews because the woman is some more kind of fine).  It's not exactly a bold, original premise, and the whole point of the story is self-explanatory.  We grow up being told not to wish our lives away, so I guess there was a little bit of a nag factor in the back of my head concerning this modern-day rehashing of the old clich&eacute;.  And, yes, some of us have no desire to ever see David Hasselhoff in anything, but fortunately we have such likeable stars as Henry Winkler and Christopher Walken (who's always good) balancing out the Hass factor.It's not a complicated story.  Michael Newman (Sandler) is a workaholic who lets his work come before his family - even his gorgeous wife Donna (Beckinsale).  He thinks he's doing the right thing, pushing himself to get that promotion and move up to that higher salary in order to better take care of his wife and kids.  The wife and kids, of course, start complaining about how they hardly ever get to spend time with him anymore, which leads to arguments, which leads to Michael going a little mental because of all the stress.  Even the lack of a universal remote control is enough to send him storming out of the house.  Sound familiar to anyone?  I think so.  Well, Michael does find a universal remote, courtesy of Morty (Walken) in the Beyond section of the local Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  Forget the TV, this little baby really does give him remote control of his universe.  He can mute the sounds of his angry wife or barking dog, fast forward through such unpleasant tasks as showering or driving to work, freeze frame everyone around him at the click of a button, etc.  Despite Morty's warnings, he comes to rely on the fast forward a little too much, and the next thing you know he's fast forwarding through his entire life, losing years at a time.  He sees the kind of loser he became as he auto piloted his way through life, but by the time he realizes that family should always come first it's too late to do anything about it - or is it?Certainly, there are parallels with It's A Wonderful Life, and you can toss a few pinches of A Christmas Carol in there, as well.  Don't forget the crude humor, since we are talking about an Adam Sandler film here.  You can't have an Adam Sandler film without at least one fart joke (I won't even mention the duck).  Just be glad that David Spade and Jon Lovitz don't pop up anywhere.  Sandler really does have a top-notch cast and crew with him this time (well, except for Hasselhoff).  Beckinsale's charms are obvious, Walken's acting skills are legendary, director Frank Coraci has already proven to be a perfect fit for Sandler in The Wedding Singer and The Waterboy, Rick Baker's make-up effects are top-notch, and the list just goes on.  They even got Dolores O'Riordan to perform a futuristic jazzy version of the Cranberries' Linger (she's the lead singer of the group, in case you didn't know).  It's a little hard for me to see ""Fonzie"" playing a grandfather, but Henry Winkler still brings an unequalled coolness factor to any project he participates in.

Fortunately, this movie was among the list of movies an old friend of mine was giving away recently not too long ago so I grabbed it as soon as I saw it.This time around, Adam Sandler plays a loving husband and father of two whose problem is being too absorbed in his work as an architect. After needing a new universal remote, Sandler finds himself in a Bed, Bath, and Beyond where he comes across Christopher Walken's character, Morty, who gives him what turns out to be a very special remote--one that controls everyday life.Unfortunately the remote ends up backfiring ultimately leading to a revelation of the true nature of ""Morty"" as well as Adam Sandler's character sadly realizing (seemingly) too late how self-absorbed he's been and that it was wrong of him to put his work before his family.To sum it up, I found it to be a pretty enjoyable movie. Perhaps not one I would pop in the DVD player every other day, but decent and enjoyable none the less. Although, one con I would say is that the farting scene went on a bit long for my tastes.Before I watched, I figured the movie would be like most Adam Sandler movies--a simple lighthearted comedy. However, I was happily surprised to find out that the movie also feels more than just a simple comedy.If you're an Adam Sandler fan and have not seen this movie, I would suggest you do.

It seemed to focus only on beeing funny and did'nt and didnt appear to be making an effort or concentrating enough on getting the audience fully involved. I thought that near the middle and ending though, you could really start to get engrossed as well as involved in the conflicts of the man's life and the deep problems that he gets himself into with the ""Universal Remote"". I think that the major reason for that is that Adam Sandler has progressed as an actor, he finally is starting to stop looking like an awkwardly old teenager and has settled down. He is still the funny Adam Sandler that we have all grown to love but he seems to be deeper than that now, Ever since he stared in the dark-comedy ""Punch-Drunk Love"" I have noticed that he takes his roles in movies alot more seriously.I thought that ""Click"" had a very good message and I was actually really getting involved in the story.

His life will not be complete until he gets a universal remote so he won't get the ceiling fan confused with the television.He visits Bed, Bath, and Beyond (way Beyond) and meets up with eccentric Morty, who finds just what he was looking for. Michael happily takes the remote home only to find that it controls EVERYTHING, just like it would on a DVD player. There is pause, fast forward, commentary, and more.Like many others would probably do, Michael fast forwards through the mundane. (Traffic jams, sleepovers, fights with his wife, even late night massages.) He is then placed on ""auto-pilot,"" ---there, but not really there. What happens next is that Michael gets exactly what he wished for, and more than he bargained for.The reason I gave it three stars, (no more, no less) is because the idea was great.

I have noticed a definite change in maturity of Adam Sandler's movies as time has gone by, for the better.  I am a big fan of Saturday Night Live, as well, though I haven't watched it on a regular basis for the past 10 years.  And I'm also a big fan of many other Saturday Night Alum, seeing their successful transfer to Hollywood Movies.Therefore, based on my past experience I had high hopes for this one.  And the way they marketed it in the advertising, you would have thought it was a classic family American comedy.  In fact, when I rented it, I brought it home, and almost immediately put it on, in our living room in front of my whole family!For the most part, it is a very good movie.  I would give it four stars for sure.  However, it seems Adam is still falling back on his old tricks.  Some of which are inappropriate for this type of movie, even rated PG-13.  I'm talking about these samples:1) Young children using 4 letter words, in very inappropriate situations, without expected reactions from adults; sorry but if I said something that bad, at the dinner table with my grandparents, I'd be asked to leave the table and grounded for a week,  It would have also been accompanied by a spanking.2) The life-size duck and dog joke went on about 5 times too many.

Sorry, I don't care how much of a jerk the guy/gal receiving the facial beef taco is, its still vulgar and not funny.  It barely worked in ""Bench-Warmers,"" it doesn't work here!5) How old is Adam?  41 to 45, at the beginning?  And we're supposed to believe his confusion over remote controls?  Come on, he was 4 when he saw his father and mother keep walking up to the television without a remote, and changing the channel.  He's virtually lived his whole life with remote controls.  And since when does somebody keep a garage remote in a house.  Wouldn't you more than likely keep it uhh, in your car, so when you drive up, you can open the garage door?  Stupid!  I think most morons know the difference between a garage remote and a television remote.6) Sorry, Adam just doesn't pull it off as an executive.  Maybe a low level office staff person?  But an executive?  Come on!7) A secretary asking to use the bathroom?  What planet am I on?  Whacky characters don't work in quite normal situations.  I think the secretary asking permission to use a bathroom would have worked if the other characters around her were stranger than she.  As it was, it was just dumb.I did think the story-line was unique, in that it brought the old ""Christmas tale"" or even the old Jimmy Stewart classic Christmas story, up to modern times.

This is a movie that definintely has ""popcorn"" written all over it, but it is fun and the ideas, although borrowed to a certain degree, make one think about life.Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman, an overworked architect who must choose between striving for a promotion at his job or pleasing his family. There are times when he tries to please everyone, including his boss (played by David Hasselhoff), but he seemingly cannot find a way to control what direction his life is going in. One night, he happens to be looking for a universal remote, and winds up getting a universal remote--for his life.Although there is the typical bathroom humor and crudeness you might expect from an Adam Sandler film, the bottom line that this is a movie that is funny, has a heart and has a message: don't let other goals interfere with family. Newman, after learning how to use the remote successfully, realizes eventually that there are many hazards as well. He misses critical junctures in his family's life, one of the most painful is the passing of his father. He feels this sadness, and in realizing that having that much control can be detrimental, he overcomes many of his own character pitfalls.This film seems to question the overworked parent who doesn't have time to spend with his or her family, and makes a point about the degree of importance we should attach to our own personal goals in life. As Sandler's character figures out, they don't add up to much, when compared to the bigger picture in life.The concept of the film has been seen and done before. We saw this before in the classic ""It's a Wonderful Life."" However, films' ideas are constantly being ""borrowed,"" and this is nothing new here. Overall, this film is a bit crude at times, but a fun movie that will have you laughing as well and, more importantly, make you think about what things you take for granted in your own life.",4,Clicking away your future for success,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,2024,"['Sure', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'roles', 'sometimes', 'are', 'sterotypical', 'predictable', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'actors', 'labeled', 'certain', 'kind', 'role', 'movie', 'definintely', 'popcorn', 'written', 'fun', 'ideas', 'borrowed', 'certain', 'degree', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'life.Adam', 'Sandler', 'Michael', 'Newman', 'overworked', 'architect', 'who', 'must', 'choose', 'striving', 'promotion', 'job', 'pleasing', 'family', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'please', 'everyone', 'including', 'boss', 'played', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'seemingly', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'way', 'control', 'what', 'direction', 'life', 'going', 'One', 'night', 'be', 'looking', 'universal', 'remote', 'up', 'getting', 'universal', 'remote', 'life.Although', 'typical', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'crudeness', 'might', 'expect', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'film', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'funny', 'heart', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'other', 'goals', 'interfere', 'family', 'Newman', 'learning', 'how', 'use', 'remote', 'successfully', 'eventually', 'are', 'many', 'hazards', 'as', 'well', 'critical', 'junctures', 'family', 'life', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'passing', 'father', 'sadness', 'realizing', 'having', 'much', 'control', 'can', 'be', 'detrimental', 'many', 'own', 'character', 'pitfalls.This', 'film', 'question', 'overworked', 'parent', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'spend', 'family', 'point', 'degree', 'importance', 'should', 'attach', 'own', 'personal', 'goals', 'life', 'Sandler', 'character', 'figures', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'when', 'compared', 'bigger', 'picture', 'life.The', 'concept', 'film', 'been', 'seen', 'done', 'before', 'saw', 'classic', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'However', 'films', 'ideas', 'are', 'constantly', 'being', 'borrowed', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'Overall', 'film', 'bit', 'crude', 'times', 'fun', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'importantly', 'make', 'think', 'what', 'things', 'take', 'granted', 'own', 'life']",N/A
1015683,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B000HRMCUC,General Breadbasket,"[1, 1]","I remember when I was in third grade, I read this children's short story collection called ""Uncanny"" by Paul Jennings. There was a short story called ""Spaghetti Pig Out"" which involved this kid getting this magic remote which could control real life, which ends up being used in a spaghetti eating contest. I don't know if there's any connection, but ""Click"", the new Adam Sandler comedy, also involves a magic remote that can control the things around you.Adam Sandler plays an architect, Michael, a man looking for that next big promotion, so he can give his wife, his son and his daughter all the things he never had as a kid. Working so hard, he just doesn't seem to have enough time to spend with his children, or with his parents or wife. He doesn't even have enough time to memorize which of the remotes in his house operates what. He tries to turn on the TV, but his garage door opens, or the fan goes off. To save some desperately needed time, he goes to a ""Beds, Baths and Beyond"" store to buy a universal remote, just like the one his neighbours, the O'Doyles, have (I wonder if they're related to the O'Doyles in ""Billy Madison""?). Their universal remote, he's told, can be pointed at any appliance and get it to do what he wants to do. He wanders into the ""Beyond"" section of ""Beds, Bath and Beyond"", and finds Morty (Christopher Walken), a man who appears to be some sort of scientist. He gives the architect a universal remote all right, a little too universal. It not only controls any appliance, but his own life. Michael can fast forward through things, rewind to reminisce, pause to stop and think, mute anyone too loud or annoying. But the remote doesn't just have video-like commands, but DVD ones too. Michael can access his ""life menu"", change languages, adjust color, and even get his own commentary (by James Earl Jones, no less). And just like amazon.com, this special remote can remember the users preferences. It all seems pretty great at first, but then of course things start to go wrong, and far beyond anything I expected...It's a great idea, I thought, and I like all the ways in which the remote is used. I also like the fact the film decides to push things forward and go really extreme with some of the remote's consequences toward the end. Christopher Walken was great, he was funny, but also kinda scary in the few parts he had to be. Adam is his usual self, though you get to see him do a bit of dramatic stuff here, a few tears, some emotion, which was interesting to see him do. I reckon he could do a really moving drama comedy one day, if he put his mind to it. He doesn't quite do it here, though.I know I should have expected it, being an Adam Sandler film and everything, but I did find some parta to be a little crude. Sandler seems to be a family man here, and the message of the film is all about family. Having dogs humping giant stuffed ducks and a little girl making comments about crack seemed a little out of place here. Unlike Sandlers other films, where the immature humour kind of fits into the atmosphere, sometimes I felt the writers were being nasty for the sake of nasty. Left a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth.It's a reasonable film, and worth a look because its an interesting concept, though if I had a universal remote like Adam's I'm not sure I'd rewind back to my favorite cinema and watch it again in a hurry.

Besides, remotes don't remember your most common actions and repeat them automatically.  I don't know what kind of electronic device does this, but a remote it is not.  This is a terrible movie that really makes no sense.  And, quite predictable too. The typical Adam Sandler fare was abound in humping dogs, children cussing and the old O'Doyle family.

I've yet to see ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" but that looks fun.""Click"" is a predictable, over-sentimental gimmick movie that does about as much as it can with Sandler and a weak script  (a much better example of a movie in this genre would be ""Liar Liar"", ""Groundhog Day"", or even ""A Christmas Carol"" where Scrooge realizes the error of his ways - this theme has been done to death).  On the other hand, if you liked Sandler's more simple-minded stuff, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Anger Management, you may enjoy this movie.  And while I don't mind crude humour  and innuendo (this movie does get a few laughs in that department before it gets into its arduous second half), it's not really a ""family movie"" for kids as some say.  Granted, it's not so great for adults either, but for different reasons.

1015687,A3080YC6R9G303,B000HRMCUC,Greg Robertson,"[1, 2]","I've gotta hand it to Adam Sandler and his buddies -- the basic idea of ""Click!"" is great.  Who wouldn't want a truly universal remote that he or she could use to control even a few parts of their world?  I even applaud them for using it as the basis for yet another ""man is saved by witnessing himself in an alternate reality"" story, ala ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  After all, if one believes the old saw that nothing truly new has been written since Shakespeare, then this is just another chance to tell such a story with fun, humor, insight, and modern twists.Unfortunately, that's where the problems begin -- the telling.  For a movie with such a fun premise, it's not such a fun -- or funny -- movie.  Oh, it definitely has its comic moments, mostly in schtick played out against the annoying kid next door, but they are too rare and MUCH too obvious.  That is, you see most of the jokes coming at least a couple minutes before they get there.And it's not just the humor that is overly set up, it's the aforementioned premise, as well.  Specifically, if you know the name of the movie and have seen just one of the movie's previews, you get the premise. Unfortunately, Sandler and the other producers apparently didn't think you would understand, so they waste scene after scene early on showing Sandler using and abusing the remote in a mix of circumstances.  So much so that it gets a bit boring, and makes Sandler's character less likeable.As for the other characters, Kate Beckinsale's acting gets better and better as the movie progresses, when she goes from just another good-hearted mom and wife to an older, wiser, and tougher wife who has had to deal with a jerk for most of her married life.  Also -- although I never imagined myself ever writing these words sincerely before -- David Hasselhoff is great.  He's perfect, in fact, in part because it's a role in which you are not asked or expected to like him.  And although I generally love everything Christopher Walken does these days, this is actually one of his weaker roles in a while.  He performs it OK, but the role itself could have been filled just as well by Rip Torn, Christopher Lloyd, or Michael Richards.  That is, the writing fails to take advantage of Walken's unique delivery and presence, leaving him just another wacky old guy.So now that I've picked on the movie for four paragraphs, why did I give it 3 stars?  First, because in general it IS a fun and occasionally funny movie with a heart-warming ending.  Second, because it's all of the above that you can safely let your 8- to 14-year-old children see (although there is a fast forward sex scene that some parents will think is too explicit, as well as relentless dog humping schtick).  But mostly because in the Amazon world, 3 stars is supposed to mean ""It's OK,"" and this film is exactly that.  It's just ""OK.""",3,"Great Idea, Mediocre Movie",1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,2852,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'hand', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'buddies', 'basic', 'idea', 'Click', 'great', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'truly', 'universal', 'remote', 'could', 'use', 'control', 'even', 'few', 'parts', 'world', 'even', 'applaud', 'using', 'basis', 'yet', 'man', 'saved', 'witnessing', 'alternate', 'reality', 'story', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'one', 'old', 'saw', 'nothing', 'truly', 'new', 'been', 'written', 'Shakespeare', 'then', 'just', 'chance', 'tell', 'story', 'fun', 'humor', 'insight', 'modern', 'twists.Unfortunately', 'where', 'problems', 'begin', 'telling', 'movie', 'fun', 'premise', 'not', 'such', 'fun', 'funny', 'movie', 'Oh', 'definitely', 'comic', 'moments', 'mostly', 'schtick', 'played', 'out', 'annoying', 'kid', 'next', 'door', 'are', 'too', 'rare', 'MUCH', 'too', 'obvious', 'see', 'most', 'jokes', 'coming', 'least', 'couple', 'minutes', 'get', 'not', 'just', 'humor', 'overly', 'set', 'up', 'aforementioned', 'premise', 'as', 'well', 'Specifically', 'know', 'name', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'just', 'one', 'movie', 'previews', 'get', 'premise', 'Unfortunately', 'Sandler', 'other', 'producers', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'understand', 'waste', 'scene', 'scene', 'early', 'showing', 'Sandler', 'using', 'abusing', 'remote', 'mix', 'circumstances', 'So', 'much', 'bit', 'boring', 'Sandler', 'character', 'likeable.As', 'other', 'characters', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'acting', 'better', 'better', 'movie', 'when', 'just', 'good-hearted', 'mom', 'wife', 'older', 'wiser', 'tougher', 'wife', 'who', 'had', 'deal', 'jerk', 'most', 'married', 'life', 'Also', 'never', 'imagined', 'ever', 'writing', 'words', 'sincerely', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'great', 'perfect', 'fact', 'part', 'role', 'are', 'not', 'asked', 'expected', 'like', 'generally', 'love', 'everything', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'days', 'actually', 'one', 'weaker', 'roles', 'while', 'OK', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'writing', 'fails', 'take', 'advantage', 'Walken', 'unique', 'delivery', 'presence', 'leaving', 'just', 'wacky', 'old', 'guy.So', 'now', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'movie', 'four', 'paragraphs', 'why', 'did', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'First', 'general', 'fun', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'movie', 'heart-warming', 'ending', 'Second', 'above', 'can', 'safely', 'let', '8-', '14-year-old', 'children', 'see', 'fast', 'forward', 'sex', 'scene', 'parents', 'will', 'think', 'too', 'explicit', 'as', 'well', 'relentless', 'dog', 'humping', 'schtick', 'mostly', 'Amazon', 'world', '3', 'stars', 'supposed', 'mean', 'OK', 'film', 'exactly', 'just', 'OK']",N/A

1015699,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000HRMCUC,Jason,"[0, 0]","Comedy and drama, it's a comedy-drama; and the screenplay is divided in an equal proportion of each. Adam Sandler's character wants a universal remote to make life ""easier"". What he doesn't expect, however, is that he'll receive a remote that does much more than control the VCR and the TV. It's a universal remote in the truest sense of the word universal; it controls the universe.The first half is hilarious. Sandler has a more mature style of humor in this one. It's not sniffing glue, seeing invisible Penguins, or making silly rhymes. It's slightly less capricious; although, there is still a little bit of fart humor.The second half...well, gets quite serious. As Sandler gets older, the remote starts to become intuitive. He no longer controls the remote; the remote begins to control him. Before he knows it, his life has changed and he has missed much more of his life than he wanted.Other interesting and/or enticing aspects of the movie make it quite enjoyable. Kate Beckinsdale's consistent beauty is worth the ticket alone. In every scene, regardless of attire of makeup, she looks absolutely stunning. The dog that has a sexuality issue causes several huge laughs with nearly the same joke every time. The daughter, when she grows up, is absolutely stunning, and will be a huge star in the very near future. I also enjoyed the appearance of the O'Doyle family, a family that first appeared on the Billy Madison movie. As with Billy Madison, the O'Doyle family experiences a little karmic justice (several times) that really makes the underdog role that Sandler portrays very enjoyable.The guy who is singing in the car will provide huge laughs. David Hasselhoff is strangely brilliant in the prick CEO role. The jogging chick is hypnotic. And Christopher Walken turns in his typically superb performance.The only negative to this movie is the insult of intelligence. For someone with a magic remote, an all-powerful remote, Sandler's character is blindingly ignorant and unimaginative.

The first was Clint Eastwood playing a romantic role in the Bridges of Madison County.  The second is this movie, a serious Adam Sandler movie that has a moral in the plot.When I buy an Adam Sandler movie, I expect a Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, or an Anger Management type of mindless comedy.  Watching the previews of ""Click"", I thought that this movie was going to be another piece of mindless comedic genius.I found this movie an excellent piece of work and disturbing at the same time.  ""Click"" is a movie about an overworked architect named Michael Newman (played by Sandler).  Michael Newman is the perfect example of a middle-aged corporate slave.  He has a beautiful family, but work always seems to get in the way and he never seems to have enough time to play with the kids or spend time with his wife.  In a fit of rage, Newman goes in search of a universal remote control after not being able to figure out what remote controls what.  Newman runs into Morty (Christopher Walken) who gives Newman a Universal Remote (as in a remote that controls the universe).  Newman uses the remote to fast-forward through the seemingly unpleasant portions of life, then finally comes to realize that he missed his whole life.As usual, Christopher Walken is awesome in his portrayal of Morty, a quirky, psychotic techo-geek (plus more).  What I found quite shocking was Sandler's brilliance in the portrayal of Newman, which was actually a serious role.  The comedy in the movie was a definite diversion of the mindless humor I have come to expect of Sandler.  There were some hilarious parts of the movie (the duck and the making of Mike Newman were some of my favorites), but it wasn't the wall-to-wall laughs I was expecting.  Rather, the movie had a very serious theme to it.  As a thirty-something slave to the corporation myself, the movie made me take a step back and review my own life and where I am headed.  As I said before, I felt this was disturbing as I was watching an Adam Sandler film.If you are looking for another Happy Gilmore, this movie isn't it.  I think this is one of those movies that is a compromise between mindless comedy and a chick-flick.  It is a movie to watch with someone you love rather than with a room of drunk friends.Overall, I thought the movie was excellent.

Skip past all the boring stuff, pause and rewind all the fun stuff. It would be a blast right? Then again, it does kind of sound like the typical ""be careful what you wish for?"" Hollywood movie.As much as I enjoyed this movie ""Click"" is highly formulaic and as such, highly predictable. If you don't see every major plot point coming way before it's delivered, then either you weren't paying much attention or you haven't seen that many movies. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with formulaic and nothing wrong with predictable. Movies succeed or fail far more on execution than originality. Hollywood rarely reinvents the wheel, it just churns out different variations. The only real problem with ""Click"" is that it gets lost in it's own message and is eventually drowned by the weight of it's dramatic second half.Everything starts out great. The comedy is delivered at a pretty consistent pace without ever diving too far into low-brow areas that Sandler's early movies were known for. There are some great supporting performances from Nick Swardson, Jennifer Coolidge, Henry Winkler and especially David Hasselhoff. This is easily the best performance I ever recall seeing from ol' Dave. He comes so close to going over the top without ever getting there and steals just about every scene he's in. The plot is enjoyable and the characters are funny, but you just know the other foot is going to fall.I admire ""Click"" for what it tried to accomplish. Sandler is really a better talent then he's ever been given credit for and his performance here is really solid.

When he gets a remote control that lets him control his life and everything around him he still doesn't realize that his family is what matters the most. He fast forwards his life at home so much that the remote automatically gets used to fast forwarding through his home life. Which finally starts to teach him a lesson. When he finally learned I was depressed but still managed to find the ending a little touching.Sandler may be a family man here but I didn't feel bad for his kids that he was hardly around. He's the same Adam Sandler that he is in all his comedies. He's an immature jerk that bullies people....even the kid next door. So okay Adam Sandler never made a movie where he can do whatever he wants with a remote control. But he made about 15 or 20 movies where he's a loud mouth jerk.Sure he learns here not to take life for granted but does Sandler's characters in his movies ever actually learn to grow-up. I mean here he picks on the kid nextdoor and then has a scene where he actually says his son should grow-up ?? I mean look at his example...lol. I'm not one of those guys that worships Sandler's comic talents because I don't see where he has that much. He just gets laughs by picking on people and yelling his way through every comedy he does and needs new material already. All he knows is how to do violent or mean humor.Now the good things about the movie...1.) Kate Beckinsale is sooo hot but the movie doesn't show her enough. When she's shown, she just gets fast forwarded so we get more Adam Sandler and less Kate Beckinsale. 2.) David Hasselhoff is actually pretty good as Sandler's boss and has shown of late that he's pretty reliable to be funny in comedies these days. 3.) since I like fantasies with It's a Wonderful Life type stories I found the movie fun at first. Then it gets a little too sad and even has Sandler crying, which he doesn't do that convincingly. So I had mixed feelings for the movie but I can't say the end didn't move me or almost make me cry.

1015709,AOKKY21CAQVGM,B000HRMCUC,Jim&Yvonne,"[2, 4]","Easy review, the movie was average.  I am a huge Adam Sandler fan, but except for the last five minutes of the movie, he was playing a character that was not likeable.  His performance seemed rushed and the movie just seemed rough around the edges.  Really, the funniest parts of this comedy were in the 60 second trailer for the movie, actually the only funny parts.  If you are expecting a full fledge Sandler comedy, be warned that this movie is more drama than comedy, though it included some cute comebacks by Sandler.  Christopher Walken was good as usual, Kate Beckinsale, though beautiful beyond belief was a wasted talent in this film.  I am not sure why she took this role, my belief is that she wanted to do a comedy after doing so many action type flicks, but she had absolutely no funny parts and contributed to the dramedy that this film actually is.  The trailer made it look like it was a comedy, but this film is more drama than it was comedy.  In all, the film was a disappointment, it was average at best, but hey Adam Sandler can afford to have a flop once in a while (though financially it wasn't, it made big bucks), he is very talented and Happy Madison Productions will put out more quality product than garbage.

Remote controls are the subject of `Click'. I'm certain this film will resonate with anyone who loves television and the power of their remote control or the special feature functions found on a digital video disc (DVD) menu. To any women who are married to a man with his finger always on the button 'Click' could change all of that. To me there is nothing more annoying when watching television then someone flicking between channels. Anyone who encourages their children to go outside and play, or read a book is certainly always in the right, but might be in the minority here. Still if that is the case for you, it will not detract from the fun. This is just another type of playing most people employ on a daily basis.Frustrated with the constant hassle of having numerous remotes and never pushing the correct button for the correct appliance, overworked individual Michael Newman, (Adam Sandler - Anger Management, Punch Drunk Love, Big Daddy) goes beyond the call of duty and gets a break by being given a universal remote free of charge. Morty (Christopher Walken - Blast from the Past, Wedding Crashers) passes Michael the quintessential remote for everything, to use at his leisure, and in doing so fulfil his every whim and desire. Only unbeknownst to Michael, this remote control develops brains, and soon holds a secret memory of past events based on previous clicks, that it can't wait to use for Michel's own benefit or its own making life ultimately more pressing for him.An awesome array of talent we should all love to watch populate this films universe with the always ever lovely Kate Beckinsale, (Underworld, Underworld: Evolution, Pearl Harbour, Serendipity, Brokedown Palace, The Aviator), Henry Winkler (Happy Days, Arrested Development, Night Shift), Sean Austin (The Lord of the Rings, 50 First Dates, (also with Adam Sandler), The Goonies, 24).

I wanted to see Nacho Libre and she wanted to see Click and so to be diplomatic about things, we tossed a coin. I guess I am going to have to see Nacho Libre another time...I'm not really big on Adam Sandler movies. I thoroughly enjoyed, the Waterboy, however, and even though I have yet to buy that movie on DVD, I watch it every time they show it on television.So, I'm sitting through this movie and the first thing I find hard to believe is that the Adam Sandler Character landed a babe like Kate Beckinsale. But of course, this movie is a ""Fantasy"" and so I guess anything is possible.Michael (the Adam Sandler character) meets Mort (played by the always delightfully weird, Christopher Walken)in the ""Beyond"" section of Bed, Bath, and Beyond and receives a universal remote free of charge because it is not yet on the market. Well, this universal remote not only controls Michael's television it also controls his universe.I can't exactly say when the movie actually ""clicked"" with me because at first, it just seemed kind of cheesy. Maybe it's because those scenes just primarly had Sandler in them. To me, Sandler needs a strong supporting cast because I really don't think he holds up on his own...but then again, do any of us...we all really need each other...The basic message of this film is that Life is a process; that things that we normally find tedious, and dull, and difficult to go through are all part of Life. We would all love to just ""fast forward"" to the good parts, but maybe every part of life - including the dull and tedious parts - are good. Be sure to bring some Kleenex because even though I didn't ""bawl"" I did tear up a bit which is crazy in the first place...I mean, it's an Adam Sandler movie...who knew?I was having a discussion with my friend who had also seen the movie and he felt that I was ""reading"" too deeply into things and maybe it was just a movie. Maybe it didn't have any other meaning other than to simply ""entertain"". Okay, I'll buy that. For the average movie goer who just wants to be entertained, it is definetely entertaining, but if you are like me and want to be entertained as well as reminded of certain basic truths about life than this movie will definetely remind you of those truths that we often forget ( or misplace) during our own process called life.Besides, after all is said and done, Kate Beckinsale is in this movie for godssakes so you have to see it!!!Have a great life, people...",4,"I ""Clicked"" With Click",1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,2508,"['So', 'wife', 'decided', 'go', 'movies', 'yesterday', 'wanted', 'see', 'Nacho', 'Libre', 'wanted', 'see', 'Click', 'so', 'be', 'diplomatic', 'things', 'tossed', 'coin', 'guess', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'see', 'Nacho', 'Libre', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'big', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Waterboy', 'however', 'even', 'have', 'yet', 'buy', 'movie', 'DVD', 'watch', 'time', 'show', 'television.So', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'movie', 'first', 'thing', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Character', 'landed', 'babe', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'course', 'movie', 'Fantasy', 'so', 'guess', 'anything', 'possible.Michael', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'character', 'Mort', 'played', 'always', 'delightfully', 'weird', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Beyond', 'section', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'universal', 'remote', 'free', 'charge', 'not', 'yet', 'market', 'Well', 'universal', 'not', 'only', 'Michael', 'television', 'also', 'universe.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'say', 'when', 'movie', 'actually', 'clicked', 'first', 'just', 'seemed', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'just', 'primarly', 'had', 'Sandler', 'Sandler', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'up', 'own', 'then', 'again', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'other', 'basic', 'message', 'film', 'Life', 'process', 'things', 'normally', 'find', 'tedious', 'dull', 'difficult', 'go', 'are', 'part', 'Life', 'would', 'love', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', 'good', 'parts', 'maybe', 'part', 'life', 'including', 'dull', 'tedious', 'parts', 'are', 'good', 'Be', 'sure', 'bring', 'Kleenex', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'bawl', 'did', 'tear', 'up', 'bit', 'crazy', 'first', 'place', 'mean', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'having', 'discussion', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'also', 'seen', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'reading', 'too', 'deeply', 'things', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'meaning', 'other', 'simply', 'entertain', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'average', 'movie', 'goer', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'entertained', 'definetely', 'entertaining', 'are', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'as', 'well', 'reminded', 'certain', 'basic', 'truths', 'life', 'movie', 'will', 'definetely', 'remind', 'truths', 'often', 'forget', 'misplace', 'own', 'process', 'called', 'life.Besides', 'said', 'done', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'movie', 'godssakes', 'so', 'have', 'see', 'Have', 'great', 'life', 'people']",N/A

1015714,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000HRMCUC,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","None of Adam Sandler's films are particularly well liked by critics, but audiences always love him. Never the less, ""Click"" was a new low for the comedy superstar. It got some of the worst reviews of the year and it didn't even manage to ""click"" with audiences. That didn't stop it from being a box-office success anyway and the film does have its merits. Sandler plays Michael Newman, an architect, who is being crushed under the pressure of family life and work. One night, fed up with the fact he can't find the correct remote to turn on the TV, he goes to Bed, Bath, and Beyond to pick up a universal remote. In an incredibly cheap joke, he heads into the Beyond section and meets Morty (Christopher Walken) who gives him what he's looking for. Problem is, when Michael returns home he finds that the remote control lets him control his universe. He can pause, skip, rewind, and mute...Whatever he wants. Using the remote to skip arguments with his wife (the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale), hit his boss (David Hasselhoff, who manages to score some laughs), and get to work quicker we start to realize how similar this movie is to another recent comedy hit. ""Bruce Almighty."" This movie openly and unapologetically borrows from other, more superior films, that came before it much like the 2006 Robin Williams vehicle (no pun intended) ""RV."" Even though Michael uses the remote for selfish reasons, the movie is still funny until it runs out of steam is the second half. Not only does it run out of steam, it seems the screenwriters ran out of ideas. The first half of the movie is a typical Adam Sandler movie, lighthearted and mean-spirited. The second half is dark comedy, with some attempts at drama. The entire atmosphere and mood of the film change. A movie that had a new joke every few minutes now takes ten minutes to give us a joke and some of them aren't that funny. Christopher Walken didn't even get one laugh from me and he's an actor that usually walks into a movie (and he walks into a lot of them) and makes it funnier. There are some scenes in this movie that are hilarious though. My picks for the two funniest scenes in the movie are when Sandler hops a fence to chase some high school kids (doesn't sound very funny, but when you see the scene it will) and when Sandler is stuck in traffic and a man pulls up next to him singing and doing some dance moves. This scene (especially when Sandler turns the volume down) should rank as one of the funniest scenes of any Adam Sandler film. The humor is very mean-spirited and there are times when Michael is a pretty unlikable character, but the movie does have it's moments but it's not worthy of many (or, possibly, even one) repeat viewing. Although, I want to add that it's similarity to ""Bruce Almighty"" might involve the fact that this film was written by two of the three screenwriters of that film. Look for Jack Nicholson's daughter (2007 Miss Golden Globe) Lorraine Nicholson in a very brief scene as the 14-year-old version of Sandler's daughter.GRADE: C+",3,"Funny, But Falls Short",1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,3030,"['None', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'films', 'are', 'particularly', 'well', 'liked', 'critics', 'audiences', 'always', 'love', 'less', 'Click', 'was', 'new', 'low', 'comedy', 'superstar', 'got', 'worst', 'reviews', 'year', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'manage', 'click', 'audiences', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'box-office', 'success', 'anyway', 'film', 'have', 'merits', 'Sandler', 'Michael', 'Newman', 'architect', 'who', 'being', 'crushed', 'pressure', 'family', 'life', 'work', 'One', 'night', 'fed', 'up', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'correct', 'remote', 'turn', 'TV', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'pick', 'up', 'universal', 'remote', 'incredibly', 'cheap', 'joke', 'Beyond', 'section', 'meets', 'Morty', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'who', 'what', 'looking', 'Problem', 'when', 'Michael', 'home', 'remote', 'control', 'control', 'universe', 'can', 'pause', 'skip', 'rewind', 'mute', 'Using', 'remote', 'skip', 'arguments', 'wife', 'gorgeous', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'hit', 'boss', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'who', 'score', 'laughs', 'get', 'work', 'quicker', 'start', 'realize', 'how', 'similar', 'movie', 'recent', 'comedy', 'hit', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'movie', 'openly', 'unapologetically', 'borrows', 'other', 'more', 'superior', 'films', 'came', 'much', '2006', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'vehicle', 'pun', 'intended', 'RV', 'Even', 'Michael', 'remote', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'movie', 'still', 'funny', 'steam', 'second', 'half', 'Not', 'only', 'run', 'steam', 'screenwriters', 'ran', 'ideas', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'typical', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'lighthearted', 'mean-spirited', 'second', 'half', 'dark', 'comedy', 'attempts', 'drama', 'entire', 'atmosphere', 'mood', 'film', 'change', 'movie', 'had', 'new', 'joke', 'few', 'minutes', 'now', 'ten', 'minutes', 'give', 'joke', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'one', 'laugh', 'actor', 'usually', 'walks', 'movie', 'lot', 'funnier', 'are', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'hilarious', 'picks', 'two', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'when', 'Sandler', 'fence', 'chase', 'high', 'school', 'kids', ""n't"", 'sound', 'very', 'funny', 'when', 'see', 'scene', 'will', 'when', 'Sandler', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'man', 'up', 'next', 'singing', 'doing', 'dance', 'moves', 'scene', 'especially', 'when', 'Sandler', 'volume', 'down', 'should', 'rank', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'film', 'humor', 'very', 'mean-spirited', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Michael', 'pretty', 'unlikable', 'character', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'not', 'worthy', 'many', 'possibly', 'even', 'one', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'want', 'add', 'similarity', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'might', 'involve', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'two', 'three', 'screenwriters', 'film', 'Look', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'daughter', '2007', 'Miss', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Lorraine', 'Nicholson', 'very', 'brief', 'scene', '14-year-old', 'version', 'Sandler', 'daughter.GRADE', 'C+']",N/A

Later he goes to a Bed Bath & Beyond he finds a room called Beyond this guy named Morty gives him a remote that controls his universe.

Would you rewind through prior events to relive the glory days?

Wouldn't it be nice if we had such capabilities, just imagine what fun a person could have with that kind of power. In Sony Pictures hit comedy ""Click"" Adam Sandler gets to experience what would happen with that power first hand, and sometimes the outcome isn't exactly what he had in mind.""Click"" is the story of Michael Newman (Adam Sandler), a man without a lot of spare time on his hands. He has a hectic, very demanding job, a boss (David Hasselhoff) who is ungrateful for everything that he does, and a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) and kids that deserve more attention than he is able to give. After feeling like life is going nowhere fast for himself, Michael visits a local store and meets a very odd man (Christopher Walken) who gives him what may be the greatest gift of all time, a universal remote. The difference between this universal remote and all others is that this one can not only control electronics, but everyday life as well. Soon, Michael is using the remote to skip arguments or boring conversations, speed up certain activities, even going back through his life to relieve the good times as a younger man. However, the remote begins to go haywire and Michael finds his life spinning out of his control, and the more he tries to fix things the worse they get. Now, he must try to regain what he's lost before it's too late.""Click"" is a movie that I wanted to see from the get-go. I thought it looked funny, it featured Adam Sandler, so I knew that was a safe bet, plus it had a great supporting cast, and what appeared to be a unique story that we all could relate to (meaning all of us that would like to have this type of control over certain aspects of life). When I finally got around to seeing the movie, I must say that it wasn't all that much like I expected. Sure, it was laugh out loud funny numerous times throughout the film, but there was seriousness to the story that was unexpected, yet a welcome addition at the same time. When the remote begins to mess with Michael's life, the movie shifts gears and becomes mostly a drama, revealing the consequences of rushing through life and how eventually it will just pass you by. It's not often that an Adam Sandler movie actually features a moral or message to the story, but this one did, and it didn't feel out of place at all.I was really surprised that for an Adam Sandler comedy, it was actually very different from his standard fare, there were his typical off-color jokes and remarks, but his character also had a sincerity to him that was uncommon for him to play. Watching him mature over the course of the film was interesting, because it forced Sandler to play more of his dramatic side rather than his slapstick side that he relies on the most. I haven't seen Adam Sandler's more serious movies ""Reign Over Me"" and ""Punch Drunk Love"", so I wasn't too sure how all of the serious elements were going to end up playing out when I saw that was definitely where the story was heading, but he handled it remarkably well. The rest of the cast was a mixture of sweet and caring (Michael's wife and kids), to somewhat strange (Michael's parents), to downright kooky and possibly on the verge of insanity (Christopher Walken's character). Each actor/actress was equally entertaining, and delivered very fun, interesting characters that were always enjoyable when on the screen. My favorite supportive character had to have been Chris Walken's, and I was happy that the writers gave him more than just a cameo of screen time. I believe he literally stole every scene he was in, and he did it so effortlessly, which is how it should be done.If you are a fan of Adam Sandler movies you should enjoy ""Click"", it does start out kind of slow, but after 10 minutes or so it really picks up, but there is some seriousness to it as well, so don't just expect to be laughing the entire time. But if you're not a fan of Sandler's films, and I know there are plenty of you out there, this is definitely one of his movies that I think you should see. It's a different type of Adam Sandler comedy, one with much more depth and originality than most of his efforts.

1015717,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000HRMCUC,Kaya Savas,"[0, 2]","MOVIE: Adam Sandler has proven to be very successful at the box office. All of his films have been huge successes and I have enjoyed all of them despite some of them being rediculously stupid. In fact, the only Adam Sandler movie that I truly found unfunny was The Longest Yard, oh yeah, and Click. Adam Sandler's latest effort fails only on one level, but that one thing costs this movie everything that it has going for it. I mean, the premise is very interesting. We've all wished at one time or another that we could pause, rewind, or fast forward moments in life. So, Adam Sandler decides to make a comedy about it . . . or wait, maybe he wanted to make a drama. The film tries to be a comedy and a drama and that absolutely kills it. There is a difference between a comic drama (also known as a dramedy) and a movie that switches from comedy to drama instantly. It was awkward too because when the film becomes straight forward drama they still sneak in a joke now and then and no one in the theater laughs because no one wants to break the silence. The bottom line here is that the film has bad direction. It doesn't know if it wants to make you laugh or make you cry. They get the movie's message out though, which is simply to cherish life and family and not take it for granted. If you want to see movies that blend comedy and drama seamlessly then see The Weather Man or The Station Agent. Click is divided right in the middle, first half = comedy, second half = drama. The movie's funny moments are far and between though. I laughed a couple of times but nothing more than a chuckle now and then. The only thing about the film that I found remarkable was the makeup. Six time Academy Award winning makeup artist Rick Baker did the makeup for Click and it was amazing. Usually when you try to make actors look old it looks artificial and very stiff. Almost every actor and actress in the movie had to be shown as their older self at different stages of their lives, and the makeup work was so realistic and natural. Call me crazy, but I would not be shocked to see a nomination for Baker come Oscar time next year.ACTING: Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler and will always be Adam Sandler. He is the same in all of his roles and that right there is not a bad thing at all. We've come to love Sandler's brand of comedy so much that we would criticize him more if he were to change acting styles. He carries his character well and we believe his struggle and personal journey, but too bad the movie was poorly executed. Kate Beckinsale plays his wife, and while she has a presence onscreen she really has no chemistry with Sandler. I found her to be only eye candy for the movie since in almost every shot of her at home she is in a tight t-shirt and very short shorts. The film also has a bunch of great supporting roles mostly from Sandler's friends. You have Henry Winkler, Sean Astin, David Hasselhoff, and even Rob Schnieder has a cameo. We also can't forget Christopher Walken who is a perfect fit for Morty, the kooky scientist. A good cast that unfortunetly cannot save the movie's poor execution and direction.BOTTOM LINE: Bad direction leads to an overall awkward and unfunny experience. We start as a comedy and turn immediately into a drama. The tone shift is too drastic and it ruins the movie. The only notable things about the movie are Rick Baker's detailed makeup design and Rupert Gregson-Williams' light and supportive score. Pass this movie if you haven't seen it yet and just wait for DVD or HBO, because it really isn't anything special.",2,"The Movie Is Divided Into Part Comedy & Part Drama, & That Absolutely Kills It",1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,3562,"['MOVIE', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'proven', 'be', 'very', 'successful', 'box', 'office', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'successes', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'rediculously', 'stupid', 'fact', 'only', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'truly', 'found', 'unfunny', 'was', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'oh', 'yeah', 'Click', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'latest', 'effort', 'only', 'one', 'level', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'everything', 'going', 'mean', 'premise', 'very', 'interesting', ""'ve"", 'wished', 'one', 'time', 'could', 'pause', 'rewind', 'fast', 'forward', 'moments', 'life', 'So', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'make', 'comedy', 'wait', 'maybe', 'wanted', 'make', 'drama', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'comedy', 'drama', 'absolutely', 'difference', 'comic', 'drama', 'also', 'known', 'dramedy', 'movie', 'comedy', 'drama', 'instantly', 'was', 'awkward', 'too', 'when', 'film', 'straight', 'forward', 'drama', 'still', 'sneak', 'joke', 'now', 'then', 'one', 'theater', 'one', 'break', 'silence', 'bottom', 'line', 'here', 'film', 'bad', 'direction', ""n't"", 'know', 'make', 'make', 'cry', 'get', 'movie', 'message', 'simply', 'cherish', 'life', 'family', 'not', 'take', 'granted', 'want', 'see', 'movies', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'seamlessly', 'then', 'see', 'Weather', 'Man', 'Station', 'Agent', 'Click', 'divided', 'right', 'middle', 'first', 'half', '=', 'comedy', 'second', 'half', '=', 'drama', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'far', 'laughed', 'couple', 'times', 'nothing', 'more', 'chuckle', 'now', 'then', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'found', 'remarkable', 'was', 'makeup', 'Six', 'time', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'makeup', 'artist', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'did', 'makeup', 'Click', 'was', 'amazing', 'Usually', 'when', 'try', 'make', 'actors', 'look', 'old', 'artificial', 'very', 'stiff', 'actor', 'actress', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'shown', 'older', 'self', 'different', 'stages', 'lives', 'makeup', 'work', 'was', 'so', 'realistic', 'natural', 'Call', 'crazy', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'shocked', 'see', 'nomination', 'Baker', 'come', 'Oscar', 'time', 'next', 'year.ACTING', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'same', 'roles', 'right', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'Sandler', 'brand', 'comedy', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'criticize', 'more', 'were', 'change', 'acting', 'styles', 'character', 'well', 'believe', 'struggle', 'personal', 'journey', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'poorly', 'executed', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'wife', 'presence', 'really', 'chemistry', 'Sandler', 'found', 'be', 'only', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'almost', 'shot', 'home', 'tight', 't-shirt', 'very', 'short', 'shorts', 'film', 'also', 'bunch', 'great', 'supporting', 'roles', 'mostly', 'Sandler', 'friends', 'have', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'even', 'Rob', 'Schnieder', 'cameo', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'who', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Morty', 'kooky', 'scientist', 'good', 'cast', 'unfortunetly', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'movie', 'poor', 'execution', 'direction.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Bad', 'direction', 'overall', 'awkward', 'unfunny', 'experience', 'start', 'comedy', 'turn', 'immediately', 'drama', 'tone', 'shift', 'too', 'drastic', 'movie', 'only', 'notable', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'detailed', 'makeup', 'design', 'Rupert', 'Gregson-Williams', 'light', 'supportive', 'score', 'Pass', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'just', 'wait', 'DVD', 'HBO', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special']",N/A

He has 2 beautiful kids, Ben and Samantha, who he doesn't get to see much because he's working lots of overtime in an attempt to be made a partner by David Hasselhoff, his ungrateful boss. One night, tired, frustrated, unable to even figure out which remote will turn on his TV, he sets out to find a ""universal remote."" In an embarrassing production of product placement that would make a NASCAR driver blush, he ends up at ""Bed, Bath & Beyond,"" specifically the ""Beyond"" room. Here he finds the resident eccentric genius employed there, called Morty, chiefly because Sandler loves having Christopher Walken, who plays the part, say ""Morty."" Morty gives him an unique experimental device to get his life under ""control."" Michael is now able to turn on any & all appliances with the a single ""click."" He gradually learns of the device's other functions: It can ""MUTE"" the bark of the family dog, PAUSE everything and fast forward through an argument with the Mrs. he can adjust his HUE as well. Wanting to learn more he visits ""the Beyond"" and Morty again. Morty tells Michael that he got exactly what he asked for ""a remote to control his universe."" Morty further demonstrates more features, including one that lets him flip through his existence at varying speeds. Michael is soon corrupted absolutely by the sheer power of the control, literally losing control. Before long he can't stop the remote from selecting what and when he will fast-forward, causing him to miss events he wants to experience, eventually leading the obligatory "" It's A WONDERFUL LIFE"" epiphany when does realize all that he's missed and sometimes it is and sometimes isn't a wonderful life, but that's okay, he gets the message and all is forgiven.The film is light formula-fare with heart, like some of Sandler's weaker films, there are laughs to be found. Sandler is okay as the nice-guy with a crude streak.  Hasselhoff is fun as the jerk boss. Some of the gags get repetitive and some aren't that funny the first time. Also an over-large amount of time is spent creating the progressively older Michael Newman.Click is directed for Sandler's Happy Madison production company by Frank Coraci of the Wedding Singer, Waterboy and most recently Around the World in 80 Days (the Jackie Chan). And Sandler again uses Henry ""the Fonz"" Winkler (previously in the Happy Madison universe as Coach Klien, and as himself in Little Nicky) and Julie Kavner (best known as the voice of Marge Simpson) to play his unappreciated folks.

1015721,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000HRMCUC,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 6]","In ""Click,"" Adam Sandler stars as Michael Newman, an overworked, underappreciated architect who's let his job replace his family.  Fed up with not receiving his fair share at work and knowing that he's about to lose his family, Newman snaps, decides that his family needs a universal remote just like everybody else and hurries out of his house and into the only store that's open that evening, Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  What he finds in the Beyond (Way Beyond) section of the store is Morty (Christopher Walken), a sales clerk who gives him a universal remote that's a tad bit unusual.  It controls every facet of his life.  He can skip over watching his dog violate a stuffed duck, mute his wife during arguments, and basically bypass any of the ho-hum moments of his life in order to get to the good stuff.  Unfortunately, skipping over so much of his life means that Newman misses the small things that make life worth living, and the big things that make life either grand or miserable.In short, this flick is a play on the Christmas classic, ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" with the typical Sandler spin.  However, unlike many reviewers have stated, I don't think that the toilet humor that Sandler's accused of using in most of his past films is too distracting in this one.  The first half of the film is rather humorous, thanks to a wonderful supporting cast which includes Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Sean Astin, and the breathtaking Kate Beckinsale.  David Hasselhoff and Jennifer Coolidge also throw in some funny performances.It's the second half of the film that really makes ""Click"" click.  As Sandler's character ages, he begins to realize that he's not that great of a guy.  He also comes to find out that there are things in life that seem rather dull until you lose them.Overall, this is a decent flick.  It's more deserving of three and a half stars than four, but I'll round up based on the second half of the film.  It does drag at times, but it's all worth it.Recommended as a strong rental for casual Sandler fans and a definite purchase for those who love all things Sandler.",4,It's A Wonderful Life?,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,2092,"['Click', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Michael', 'Newman', 'overworked', 'underappreciated', 'architect', 'who', 'let', 'job', 'replace', 'family', 'Fed', 'up', 'not', 'receiving', 'fair', 'share', 'work', 'knowing', 'lose', 'family', 'Newman', 'family', 'universal', 'remote', 'just', 'everybody', 'else', 'house', 'only', 'store', 'open', 'evening', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'What', 'Beyond', 'Way', 'Beyond', 'section', 'store', 'Morty', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'sales', 'clerk', 'who', 'universal', 'remote', 'tad', 'bit', 'unusual', 'facet', 'life', 'can', 'skip', 'over', 'watching', 'dog', 'violate', 'stuffed', 'duck', 'mute', 'wife', 'arguments', 'basically', 'bypass', 'ho-hum', 'moments', 'life', 'order', 'get', 'good', 'stuff', 'Unfortunately', 'skipping', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'Newman', 'small', 'things', 'make', 'life', 'worth', 'living', 'big', 'things', 'make', 'life', 'grand', 'miserable.In', 'short', 'flick', 'play', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'typical', 'Sandler', 'spin', 'However', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'toilet', 'humor', 'Sandler', 'accused', 'using', 'most', 'past', 'films', 'too', 'distracting', 'one', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'rather', 'humorous', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'breathtaking', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'also', 'throw', 'funny', 'performances.It', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'really', 'Click', 'click', 'Sandler', 'character', 'ages', 'realize', 'not', 'great', 'guy', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'things', 'life', 'seem', 'rather', 'dull', 'lose', 'them.Overall', 'decent', 'flick', 'more', 'deserving', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'four', ""'ll"", 'round', 'up', 'based', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'drag', 'times', 'worth', 'it.Recommended', 'strong', 'rental', 'casual', 'Sandler', 'fans', 'definite', 'purchase', 'who', 'love', 'things', 'Sandler']",N/A

I guess it's a dramedy, which is important to know if you go into it expecting a lighthearted, fun, family movie. It is each of those things, but at different moments. Adam Sandler plays a workaholic architect who is so busy trying to get ahead at work that his family life begins to suffer.  When he is offered a ""universal remote that controls your universe,"" he jumps at the chance to have a sense of control in his chaotic life. The next thing he knows his life is a DVD complete with commentary from James Earl Jones that he can pause, rewind, and fast forward at his leisure.The moral of the story is that you should be careful what you wish for because when you get it, you might not want it anymore. Overall, this movie was fine, but I didn't think it was stellar.  It's along the same lines of Bruce Almighty and that movie about disappearing poop with Jack Black. If you liked those, or the general message therein, I think you'll like this one. I wasn't expecting the middle part of the movie to be such a downer, but if you go into it expecting the somber moments I think you'll enjoy it more.Also, David Hasselhoff plays Sandler's boss, a completely self-absorbed misogynist.

Adam Sandler stars in and produced this comedy about being careful what you ask for because you may not like what you get.Sandler is an architect at a New York firm that wants success and a better life. He finds it when shopping for a remote he meets angel Christopher Walken, who gives him a device that not only controls his TV and stereo, it controls everything in his life.He soons finds he can put people and situations on hold and, better yet, fast forward through parts of life he doesn't want to waste time experiencing -- arguments, illness, speeches, promotions -- and instantly move ahead to better, more properous times. This seems great until the gadget figures out his tendencies and auto-programs his life, ensuring that our hero will inadvertantly miss months, even years, of goings on with no ability to stop it.Meanwhile, the film revolves around comic episodes and one liners -- some not fit for family fare -- by the star and co-stars Kate Beckinsale as the wife, Henry Winkler as dad/grandpa, Julie Kavner as mom/grandma, and David Hasselhoff as the boss. The movie seems to go in a negative direction the longer it lasts but has a happy ending that will leave most viewers smiling and happy.I enjoyed this at home on a mid-week evening when it was the best thing available to me. This isn't a great film in any respect but it works well generating a range of emotions from belly-busting laughter to sadness to wistfulness and more.

1015727,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000HRMCUC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 9]","The closest Adam Sandler has come to a great film to this point in his career is ""50 First Dates.""  As far as I was concerned get rid of Rob Schneider as Ula and cut the vomiting Walrus and you would have a five star movie.  ""Click"" is in the same mold in that it combines Sandler's romantic side with a unusual situation and still insists on adding raunchy humor (I suppose there could be worse things than your dog trying to have sex with a giant stuffed duck, but let us not go there).  Consequently, ""Click"" is not an improvement on ""50 First Dates,"" but I do not think that it constitutes a step backwards, which would be welcomed news.Sandler plays Michael Newman, who has married beyond his reach the gorgeous Donna (Kate Beckinsale), and has two young kids who love him, his son Ben (Joseph Castanon) and his daughter (Tatum McCann), despite the fact that he is so busy trying to make partner at the architecture firm where he works that he is ignoring his family more and more each day.  Every time he makes a promise to his family, he feels forced bo break it to satisfy John Ammer (David Hasselhoff) at work.  Things are getting so bad that Michael suddenly decides that what he needs ia a universal remote, just like the O'Doyle's next door, so that at least he can turn on his TV instead of the overhead fan.  So he heads off into the night and since Bed, Bath and Beyond is the only store opens, goes in to find his universal remote.  What he finds instead in the Beyond part of the store is Morty (Christopher Walken), who indeed has a universal remote, and not just your ordinary universal remote, as I assume everybody knows from the previews.I must say up front that I am pretty sure I could listen to Christopher Walken say anything, up to an including the instructions for using a universal remote or any other form of technology and be thoroughly entertained.  I would also add that Morty is absolutely right about Donna's body.  Anyway, with his amazing universal remote Michael quickly learns that he can use it to control his world and click away his problems, from muting his dog, fast-forwarding through fights with his wife, and pausing his boss so that he can slap the guy silly (although I think close-captioning would have been funnier for the scene with the Japanese businessmen at the restaurant).  Then Michael discovers the catch.It is not, as the trailer would lead you to believe, that the remote breaks.  But rather, as Morty explains, that it functions like Tivo in that it pays attention to what he is doing with the remote and automatically does it again.  So if you decide to fast-forward through an illness or foreplay with your wife, then that becomes the way it will be for the rest of your life.  This is a fairly interesting idea given the premise of the film, and the only real flaw in it is that once you establish Michael is on ""auto pilot"" during the chapters of his life that are skipped, then I do not see how he could be so successful at his business given that he has to use the remote to save the bacon with the Japanese firm.  But that is just because I pay attention to the rules of the game and like to take them to their logical extensions.Sandler has gathered familiar faces for this film, with Henry Winkler playing Michael's father, Sean Astin as Ben's swim coach, and even a nice cameo by Schneider, whose understate performance encouraged my hopes for this film.  Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the raunchy humor got me to laugh out loud several times, even if a grown man striking back at the Eddie Haskell-wannabee who lives next door would be wrong, very wrong indeed (but still funny).  However, my wife would like me to state in no uncertain terms that what I was laughing at was clearly guy humor, and I am pretty sure she rolled her eyes and shook her head more often than she joined in on the laughing (it was hard to tell, the theater was dark and I was trying to watch the movie).Ultimately, the problem with the movie is the end, when Michael gets his second chance.  That is because the screenplay by Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe (the team who did ""Bruce Almighty"") invests so much in the big epiphany and final grace note at the end of the third act that they apparently have nothing much to come up with for the epilogue where we are assured Michael and his family will live happily ever after.  ""50 First Dates"" had a great final payoff scene, and you can go all the way back to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" to see how well you can milk the return from Hell to the real world.  Granted, you will not top the end of the Hell sequence, but then you are not supposed to.  Still, there has to be a better payoff for what comes between that point and the start of the credits.  I am still rounding up on this one, but I should have been in a position to round down.  Final Note: Nice touch with getting Dolores O'Riordan from the Cranberries to show up to sing ""Linger"" live at the wedding.",4,Controlling your universe is not all it is cracked up to

1015730,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B000HRMCUC,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[0, 1]","Click is a tricky film to review, it's not as great as some indicate it is, but not as bad as others indicate it is either.The fundamental problem with this film is it's juvenile humor, however, as a Happy Madison's production, that is almost mandatory, and based on that expectation, it is not excessive, when compared to some of Sandler's other films such as ""Happy Gilmnore"" or even ""Waterboy"". When the film sticks to the core plot and leaves out much of the silly low brow humor (with a few exceptions, such as the scene with his wife's crazy friend, or the scene with the Japanese businessmen), it really excels, as the characters are actually interesting and other than the silly humor, the relationships feel real.  When the film hits emotionally, it hits hard, and yet at the same time, if you were to take this humor out, it would be a rather mundane, rote, and over sentimental film with just another take on ""A Christmas Carol"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life"".There are a lot of themes in this film that I have yet to see touched upon in the reviews here. Yes, it plays in the whole 'Spend time with family bit,' but on a deeper level then I normally see in films especially in a comedy. It deeply comments on how people have a tendency to follow the example they see, and  not what they hear.  This is aptly exhibited through his daughters use of vulgarities and his son's poor eating habits; both things they watched their father do. We also see this exhibited through some changes in his son later on when those bad eating habits are changed to good habits through the influence of his health nut stepfather (Sean Astin).A constant recurring theme in this film is struggle of money vs time, which we can see started when he was a child in a flashback camping scene, with a rivalry from childhood (we only see this rival in a flashback, in the present we only see his son and wife).  His rival's son is constantly gloating about all the ""cool"" stuff he has, and Sandler's character is very immature, like he has never grown out of that rivalry (cause he has not), and even results to picking on his rival's son, which at times is funny, such as the time his son and the kid our playing catch and he pauses it and moves his glove so the ball hits him in the face, other times it just comes across as petty.It is truly sad that this man never truly grew up, and what the experience with the remote gives him, is a chance to finally mature in to an adult mentally and emotionally.  I would like to say there are not people like this in real life, but I have met them, still stuck in the past, still striving for things in the wrong way, and scared and hurting people in their path out of habit.  The only good thing he took with him as hew grew up was his dream of being financially free (which is a great dream to have), but again, he takes the wrong road to achieve it, by constantly trying to bend over backwards and please his boss at the peril of his personal life and family's happiness.It also comments on the pitfalls of a job (something which the American school system programs us to have, rather than say, owning a business and creating a passive cash flow) and how we become controlled by them.  His wife at one point even calls him a 'wage slave', which I found to be a very apt description of someone climbing up the corporate ladder.  He is constantly chasing a dream that can't happen with a job, it is not possible to have both time and money in a corporate world.Although he is seeking to gain time by losing it in the short term, which is actually smart (As he states to his wife, when he is making millions he will hire a bunch of ppl to do everything for him), but he is using the wrong means to do so (he needs a passive cash flow, not an active one such as job for that) and is neglecting his key relationships in the process, which is the real folly he commits here.He constantly equates corporate success with freedom, and is constantly comparing himself to a childhood rival who 'Has it all.' Instead of just realizing he has it good with his Wife and kids, and actually has a really nice house and life if he'd just see what's in front of him (not that its bad to strive for more, but that plan should be a team effort of the family, not a solo effort, if you are married), but he cannot see it, due to his constant focus on other women, other ppl's money, and why he doesn't like his life, something that most people do, and it is this focus on others and blaming others for our problems  that keeps us as humans from ever truly being satisfied.The film doesn't say money is bad or that success is bad, but rather, when that journey neglects your family, it's not a path worth taking.  The film  aptly shows how marriages suffer when you lose your focus on why you're doing something and the how becomes the why instead of the why being the why.Some see the ending as a co-pout, and yes, it is, but by the end of the film, I saw it as a great relief, as I was nearly hysterically crying the first time I saw it and it allowed me to appreciate what came before without being morbidly depressed, but on repeated viewings, not watching the ending after the sad denouement, might make the film better.  I am torn, as to if it it hadn't ended that way, would it  have put the focus on his failures instead of how he could change his life around, but if it ended with him lying face up (I suppose it'd be a lot like the ending to the 'Bridge to Terrabithia'),  might it have changed the overall message of the film?  Given the often light-hearted tone, the ending was congruent with keeping this tone, and  the ending was not actually out of character for a film of this nature(13 Going on 30 had a similar ending, but it definitely worked better in the overall scheme of the film), one in which the point was to make you laugh, but hopefully think a little as well.Although surprisingly contemplative and thought provoking  at times, it is the ever persistent silly tone that both makes this stand out in the cannon of films of this nature, but also might keep it from being truly great, and why it will most likely never become a classic, although it is worth watching if you can can enjoy the silly jokes.God Bless ~Amy",4,Almost Great.,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,6250,"['Click', 'tricky', 'film',

1015732,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B000HRMCUC,"Maine Writer ""David""","[45, 98]","You either really like Adam Sandler or you loathe him.  He's a polarizing guy.  I really liked him -- until this movie.  It isn't bad enough to walk out of, and there are moments of fun, but a large percentage of it is painful.  Let's start at the beginning.The concept is straight out of Junior League Screenwriting 101 -- 75% borrowed, 25% original.  Actually, make that 85% borrowed.  Like that Twilight Zone episode about the lout who obtains a stop watch that can stop time, Adam Sandler plays a lout who finds a ""universal remote"" that can not only pause the world (like the stop watch), but can mute it, rewind it, and fast-forward through all manner of unpleasantness -- and, it turns out, pleasantness as well.  But, it becomes apparent about twenty minutes into the story that the writers are way over their heads.  Not only do the seem to have no imagination as to what a character might really do with a device like this, they start adding ""rules"" to try to twist some kind of a character arc out of this device (like this clunky concept -- at least in the hands of these writers -- that the remote ""automatically programs itself based upon what you do with it"" that, sadly, becomes the central artifice for the entire movie).Sandler, in addition, has never been less sympathetic.  Not only hasn't he aged well, he's also not really that funny anymore.  The schtick that peppers all of his films really feels like schtick in this movie.  Bad schtick.  I suppose it was inevitable that it would get old.The supporting cast is completely wasted, both with bad lines and stupid set pieces. Christopher Walken, whose facial expressions alone can be comedic genius, visibly struggles with wooden dialogue, and is forced to inhabit an old joke:  the ""Beyond"" department of Bed, Bath & Beyond.  (It's one thing when Peter Griffin told this joke a couple of years back on Family Guy, but seeing it resurrected as a centerpiece of this movie is, well, pathetic.  Either the writers were cynics and felt that middle America might still laugh at it, or they thought they were being funny and original. I'm not sure which is worse.)Kate Beckensale is beautiful, but it is impossible to accept her as Sandler's wife.  She's too nice, to sweet, and too attractive.  Now if Click was just a slapstick comedy, we might be able to deal with this.  But that leads to the movie's biggest problem:  It turns into this maudlin and insulting mess, a preachy message movie about ""family comes first.""  At that point, it stops being funny entirely.  It tries pulling at heart strings with these big, clumsy hands.  Frankly, it's just about insufferable.And then, the biggest idiocy of all ...

I borrowed this from a friend, thinking it was gonna be an Adam Sandler film that doesn't have Drew Barrymore that I can give a bad review.The first half of the film is your standard Adam Sandler. Not funny jokes, David Hasselhoff being a parody of himself, Jennifer Coolidge playing a role she's playing a million times before but with less screen time, and Kate Beckinsale playing wallpaper that screams at the lead character occasionally.It's the second half of the film where it really kicks into gear, and I recommend staying until at least this point before deciding whether you love or hate the film. Without giving too much away, the universal remote control remembers the points that Adam's character skipped, and his life takes on a whole new meaning as he fights to control it.The film completely changes direction at this point, and has led to comparisons to It's A Wonderful Life, which I haven't seen, but everyone seems to rave about it. It becomes surprisingly emotional, and touching.I have to say that Click is one of Adam Sandler's best films and completely different to the trailer. It allows Adam to extend the normal goofy character he plays, to something more dramatic. It does seem similar to Bruce Almighty at some points, and does have some bad jokes that no one laughs at - the dog and the toy duck for example - but it's actually (and I'm shocking myself by saying this) an Adam Sandler movie WORTH seeing.",3,Not just another bog standard Adam Sandler film,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,1650,"['love', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'hate', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'fence', 'far', 'concerned', 'when', 'Yes', 'find', 'irritating', 'also', 'love', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'Duplex', 'known', 'USA', 'borrowed', 'friend', 'thinking', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'can', 'give', 'bad', 'review.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'standard', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Not', 'funny', 'jokes', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'being', 'parody', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'playing', 'role', 'playing', 'million', 'times', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'playing', 'wallpaper', 'lead', 'character', 'occasionally.It', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'where', 'really', 'gear', 'recommend', 'staying', 'least', 'point', 'deciding', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'universal', 'remote', 'control', 'points', 'Adam', 'character', 'skipped', 'life', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'control', 'it.The', 'film', 'completely', 'direction', 'point', 'led', 'comparisons', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'everyone', 'rave', 'surprisingly', 'emotional', 'touching.I', 'have', 'say', 'Click', 'one', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'best', 'films', 'completely', 'different', 'trailer', 'Adam', 'extend', 'normal', 'goofy', 'character', 'something', 'more', 'dramatic', 'seem', 'similar', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'points', 'have', 'bad', 'jokes', 'one', 'dog', 'toy', 'duck', 'example', 'actually', ""'m"", 'shocking', 'saying', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'WORTH', 'seeing']",N/A

One night Michael end up at a Bed Bath & Beyond looking to purchase a universal remote control. Venturing into the mysterious ""Beyond"" room, Michael meets a mysterious man (Christopher Walken) who gives him a remote control that's supposed to be the top of the line in technological advancement. Michael soon discovers that he has the ability to control every aspect of his life. He can fast-forward through arguments with his wife (Kate Beckinsale), avoid boring dinners with his parents (Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner), and even mute the family dog.Unfortunately, Michael learns that having so much control over his own life isn't all fun and games. The universal remote eventually begins to run on auto pilot, and Michael begins fast-forwarding through large chunks of his life. He zips ahead a year in anticipation of a promotion, but learns that his home life has suffered irreparable damage. Michael eventually loses his wife to his son's swimming instructor (Sean Astin) and has no real relationship with his children. Before he knows what's happening, Michael is suddenly an old man and has witnessed his entire life go by in the blink of an eye. Fast-forwarding through life has resulted in Michael missing out on his life entirely, and he is more miserable than he ever thought possible.There is a lot of gross humor in this movie which did not appeal to me at all. I think the film would have been a lot more moving if the director chose to leave out all the farting/flapping/humping jokes.

1015744,A2AODAE9J0LM39,B000HRMCUC,"Meredith ""Meredith""","[2, 2]","Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) has a typical corporate middle management conflict: Work vs. Family. Forcing his wife to repriorotize a promised family outing at the ""do it or lose your standing"" threat of his boss, Newman goes out on the only errand for which he can think to leave the house: to look for an Universal Remote to simplify the ""which one do I use for this?"" issue he's been fumbling.The only store open is Bed, Bath and Beyond. Newman flops on a mattress to rest, from which he sees the Magical Blue Door below the sign, ""BEYOND."" A strange man in a blue coat named Morty (Christopher Walken) takes him to a new Universal Remote model sitting atop empty shelves. This special model works on more than the TV; it works on the ""screen"" of life, as well. Morty gives Newman his phone number to call, and gives the remote for free.Newman begins realizing the remote's powers when his wife is intensely talking to him about serious family issues, and he says, ""Freeze,"" as he pauses the TV - and realizes that he has paused her, as well. He realizes he can avoid unpleasantries, and, as he is focused on getting ahead at work, he learns that he can fast-forward though such boring events as family dinners in order to get to his work. He sees fast-forwarding as a way to fulfill his other commitments without having to actually live through them.Newman uses Morty's phone number when he doesn't remember committing to something of which his wife reminds him. Morty shows Newman that, during fast-forwards, Newman is on something called Autopilot, meaning that he is physically present and able to respond at levels not involving his conscious participation. Morty shows Newman ""the Menu,"" from which Newman may navigate through his life. After perusing some scenes, Morty advises Newman that the remote has a special built-in feature that assesses his usage habits and begins performing his preferences, automatically.Newman already fast-forwarded activities in the marital bed once, and it appears that he is stuck with these activities in fast-forward mode for all of ""Beyond."" He didn't get the promotion he wanted when he wanted it, so he fast-forwarded to when he did get the promotion, thinking it would only be a few months. It was over a year later, and he found that his children already didn't like to do some of the things they liked ""only a few moments ago.""Morty tells Newman that Newman's preference has clearly been set to fast-forward between Work issues, and the remote has accommodated that preference. Newman pops into awareness to find himself promoted, obese, divorced, hospitalized, at his son's wedding, and hospitalized again. He learns that his father (Henry Winkler) has died, and when Newman faces Morty again, Morty takes him to the last time he saw his father. Newman was on autopilot. Now, Newman can see how destructive autopilot has been in his life.This was where I jumped my rating to four stars. Newman was a remote visitor to his own life, living on autopilot, not getting involved, not loving the people in front of him. He jumped from pinnacle to pinnacle, not involved in the process, not sharing himself...not understanding that life, at its finest, is living moment to moment, being completely aware of what is before him, loving who is in front of him, speaking his truth, not chasing, on the outside, after something that he already had on the inside. After divorcing Newman, his wife married someone who was present, and Newman's children thrived in that relationship.(Spoiler Alert now 'til the end)Newman got something the rest of us don't get in this one lifetime; a second chance to take back time and do it again. He awakens on the mattress to what may have been a dream (no blue ""Beyond"" door this time). He immediately goes home to reinstate the family outing. The remote shows up on his countertop with a note from Morty (""You'll know what to do this time"").Newman puts the remote and note into the drawer and walks out to be a participant in his own life.",4,Life on Autopilot: A Remote Perspective,1166140800,"12 15, 2006",2006,4016,"['Michael', 'Newman', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'typical', 'corporate', 'middle', 'management', 'conflict', 'Work', 'vs.', 'Family', 'Forcing', 'wife', 'repriorotize', 'promised', 'family', 'outing', 'do', 'lose', 'standing', 'threat', 'boss', 'Newman', 'out', 'only', 'errand', 'can', 'think', 'leave', 'house', 'look', 'Universal', 'Remote', 'simplify', 'one', 'do', 'use', 'issue', 'been', 'fumbling.The', 'only', 'store', 'open', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'Newman', 'mattress', 'rest', 'Magical', 'Blue', 'Door', 'sign', 'BEYOND', 'strange', 'man', 'blue', 'coat', 'named', 'Morty', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'new', 'Universal', 'Remote', 'model', 'sitting', 'atop', 'empty', 'shelves', 'special', 'model', 'works', 'more', 'TV', 'screen', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'Morty', 'Newman', 'phone', 'number', 'call', 'remote', 'free.Newman', 'realizing', 'remote', 'powers', 'when', 'wife', 'intensely', 'talking', 'about', 'serious', 'family', 'issues', 'Freeze', 'TV', 'paused', 'her', 'well', 'can', 'avoid', 'unpleasantries', 'focused', 'getting', 'ahead', 'work', 'can', 'fast-forward', 'such', 'boring', 'events', 'family', 'dinners', 'order', 'get', 'work', 'fast-forwarding', 'way', 'fulfill', 'other', 'commitments', 'having', 'actually', 'live', 'them.Newman', 'Morty', 'phone', 'number', 'when', ""n't"", 'remember', 'committing', 'something', 'wife', 'Morty', 'Newman', 'fast-forwards', 'Newman', 'something', 'called', 'Autopilot', 'meaning', 'physically', 'present', 'able', 'respond', 'levels', 'not', 'involving', 'conscious', 'participation', 'Morty', 'Newman', 'Menu', 'Newman', 'may', 'navigate', 'life', 'perusing', 'scenes', 'Morty', 'Newman', 'remote', 'special', 'built-in', 'feature', 'usage', 'habits', 'performing', 'preferences', 'automatically.Newman', 'already', 'fast-forwarded', 'activities', 'marital', 'bed', 'once', 'stuck', 'activities', 'fast-forward', 'mode', 'Beyond', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'promotion', 'wanted', 'when', 'wanted', 'fast-forwarded', 'when', 'did', 'get', 'promotion', 'thinking', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'few', 'months', 'was', 'year', 'later', 'found', 'children', 'already', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', 'things', 'liked', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'ago', 'Morty', 'Newman', 'Newman', 'preference', 'clearly', 'been', 'set', 'fast-forward', 'Work', 'issues', 'remote', 'accommodated', 'preference', 'Newman', 'awareness', 'find', 'promoted', 'obese', 'divorced', 'hospitalized', 'son', 'wedding', 'hospitalized', 'again', 'father', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'died', 'when', 'Newman', 'Morty', 'again', 'Morty', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'father', 'Newman', 'was', 'autopilot', 'Now', 'Newman', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'destructive', 'autopilot', 'been', 'life.This', 'was', 'where', 'jumped', 'rating', 'four', 'stars', 'Newman', 'was', 'remote', 'visitor', 'own', 'life', 'living', 'autopilot', 'not', 'getting', 'involved', 'not', 'loving', 'people', 'front', 'jumped', 'pinnacle', 'pinnacle', 'not', 'involved', 'process', 'not', 'sharing', 'not', 'understanding', 'life', 'finest', 'living', 'moment', 'moment', 'being', 'completely', 'aware', 'what', 'loving', 'who', 'front', 'speaking', 'truth', 'not', 'chasing', 'outside', 'something', 'already', 'had', 'inside', 'divorcing', 'Newman', 'wife', 'married', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'present', 'Newman', 'children', 'thrived', 'relationship', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'now', 'end', 'Newman', 'got', 'something', 'rest', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'lifetime', 'second', 'chance', 'take', 'back', 'time', 'do', 'again', 'mattress', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'dream', 'blue', 'Beyond', 'door', 'time', 'immediately', 'home', 'reinstate', 'family', 'outing', 'remote', 'up', 'countertop', 'note', 'Morty', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'time', '.Newman', 'remote', 'note', 'drawer', 'out', 'be', 'participant', 'own', 'life']",N/A

This movie is way better than what has been written about it.  This is one of Sandler's best performances (along with Spanglish) as Michael Newman (hey, that's my name too!) a struggling father who has no time for his kids and wife because he devouts all of his time to his demanding worklife.  In a tale that combines the lessons of The Monkey's Paw and It's a Wonderful Life, Newman comes across his own Angel (Christopher Walken) in the ""Beyond"" section of Bed Bath and Beyond.  Walken playing the wierd Morty, has just what Newman needs and that is a remote control that can change Newman's life.  Walken lets Newman know the caveat which is that the remote is non-returnable once accepted.  Not being familiar with The Cat's Paw tale (where every gift has a catch) Newman starts using the remote to help him skip uncomfortable situations in life that prevent him from getting to his ultimate goal (to get some work done without the distractions of family obligations).Each time Newman thinks he has succeeded he has unforeseen circumstances thrown at him by his demanding boss (David Hasselhoff).  The movie has some very touching moments especially from Newman's well-meaning father (Henry Winkler).  When Newman finally learns that the things that the remote is causing him to avoid, are really the things that he wants to experience the most, it may be too late to change his mind.A really fun and touching movie!",4,A Lot Better Than Expected!,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,1515,"['Having', 'read', 'bad', 'critical', 'reviews', 'went', 'film', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'movie', 'way', 'better', 'what', 'been', 'written', 'one', 'Sandler', 'best', 'performances', 'Spanglish', 'Michael', 'Newman', 'hey', 'name', 'too', 'struggling', 'father', 'who', 'time', 'kids', 'wife', 'time', 'demanding', 'worklife', 'tale', 'lessons', 'Monkey', 'Paw', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Newman', 'own', 'Angel', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Beyond', 'section', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'Walken', 'playing', 'wierd', 'Morty', 'just', 'what', 'Newman', 'remote', 'control', 'can', 'change', 'Newman', 'life', 'Walken', 'Newman', 'know', 'caveat', 'remote', 'non-returnable', 'once', 'accepted', 'Not', 'being', 'familiar', 'Cat', 'Paw', 'tale', 'where', 'gift', 'catch', 'Newman', 'using', 'remote', 'help', 'skip', 'uncomfortable', 'situations', 'life', 'prevent', 'getting', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'get', 'work', 'done', 'distractions', 'family', 'obligations', '.Each', 'time', 'Newman', 'succeeded', 'unforeseen', 'circumstances', 'thrown', 'demanding', 'boss', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'movie', 'very', 'touching', 'moments', 'especially', 'Newman', 'well-meaning', 'father', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'When', 'Newman', 'finally', 'things', 'remote', 'causing', 'avoid', 'are', 'really', 'things', 'experience', 'most', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'change', 'mind.A', 'really', 'fun', 'touching', 'movie']",N/A

1015751,A2H22I2RWE0HOV,B000HRMCUC,Mr. Sinister,"[1, 1]","When I watch something with Adam Sandler in it, I want it to be kinda stupid and kinda crude with just a smidgen of goodness sewn into the script somewhere along the line.  I thought I was getting that in Click and maybe I did a little, but not as much as you would expect.  This is not Happy Gilmore.  This is not The Wedding Singer.  This is Click, Adam Sandler on Prozac.  Very formulaic.  Almost seemed written to where anyone could have played Sandler's part.Michael Newman is a ditzy workaholic (God this has been done so many times before!) who thinks that he must put his job before his gorgeous wife and his two children to get ahead and make everything perfect.  Juggling work and swim meets and the day to day rigors of life, Michael heads to Bed, Bath & Beyond to pick up a universal remote for the television.  When he enters the Beyond section of the store he runs into the wonky-haired Morty (Christopher Walken) who gives him a prototype remote control to manage everything.  Literally.  Everything.  The remote works on Michael's life.  He can pause, mute, rewind and fastforward everything.  Wow.  Only a few million problems.  Morty (Mortis) is the Angel Of Death. And having the ability to alter your life has some serious repercussions.  At one point, and this actually makes the film utterly ridiculous, Sandler's character fastforwards through sex with Kate Beckinsale.  Yeah.  Right!  IDIOT! Well, one thing leads to another and the remote starts to automatically fastforward though everything that should be improtant.  Newman winds up a fat, lonely, divorced old man who has achieved success that he can hardly remember attaining.  Sad.  Yeah.  Jeez.There are a few fatal flaws in Click that make it subpar.  One, the writing, hell, even the casting is off.  Sure, Christopher Walken plays a great weird character, but he looks like Robin Williams in Flubber.  Secondly, Kate Beckinsale and Adam Sandler, as a married couple?  What universe is this?  Kate Beckinsale is absolutely stunning.  Adam Sandler is Forrest Gump.  And why are their children pretty much the same age?  Adam is mean-spirited in this just one too many times and the whole ""I hate my job but I've gotta succeed for the family"" scenario is downright cliche.  Most people hate their jobs! Duh!  Life sucks, get a helmet! You don't sacrifice your family for money, everyone knows that, but it takes Sandler the entire movie and his entire life to realize that.  All in all the ending before the actual ending is way too depressing for an Adam Sandler movie and then they wipe it out as a dream.  Anyone see the flaws here?  My creative writing teacher back in high school told us that if we ever ended a story like that she would beat us about the head and neck.  Duh!  This is simple Hollywood tripe with a lot of special effects thrown in and a very mundane storyline.  Not unwatchable, but pretty f*cking stupid, if you want to know.

1015754,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000HRMCUC,Only-A-Child,"[1, 2]","They keep letting this guy (Adam Sandler) make movies; most likely because audiences flock to see most of his stuff, as was the case with ""Click"" (2006). I'm not going to go into a rant about the sophistication level of those who patronize their local multi-plexus. Suffice it to say that ""Click"" is as good as at least half the big-budget ($70 Million) stuff that is being released to the mainstream public. It raked in some serious cash last July.Apparently Sadler has a thing for Frank Capra, as this is his second attempt to remake a Capra classic (insert ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town""). ""Click"" is Sandler's take on ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946). At least I assume the Jimmy Stewart classic was what they were aiming at because the end result seems more of a blend of ""Scrooged"" and ""Being There"". ""Click"" is probably Sandler's all-time best performance; in the style of and equal in quality to a good Tim Allen performance. He is assisted by a supporting cast of recognizable actors; Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, and Sean Astin. There is also a brief appearance by Jack Nicholson's daughter Lorraine, who looks amazingly like Jack back in his ""Easy Rider"" days; this is actually kind of scary.Kate Beckinsale has the same role that Winona Ryder had in Mr. Deeds. While neither of them rank up there with Jean Arthur (the heroine in both Capra classics) they are still two of the best actresses out there today. I'm assuming both were very well paid because the scripts offer little opportunity for either to showcase their considerable acting skills. In fact the mismatch between talent and opportunity produces a strange discordance in both films. This might be one of those cases where a less talented performer would have been a better fit.George Bailey (and Scrooge) had an attitude adjustment after being granted visions of the past and the future by his guardian angel. Michael Newman's (Sandler) angel (Walken), who works in the local Bed, Bath and Beyond store, gives him a television remote control that he can click whenever he wants to fast-forward his life past the parts that are annoying distractions to his workaholic aspirations. At first this seems like a wonderful device as he can dispense with the family interactions that complicate his life. But Michael soon discovers that the device programs itself and shifts him further and further into the future. The remote can also freeze a scene, mute the sound, and select past scenes from his life; but the film mostly concentrates on its fast-forwarding function.""Click"" is technically a comedy and apparently some find a lot to laugh about. There are some funny moments early in the production but I found the humor to be in short supply for most of the story.Ultimately ""Click"" has a ""Groundhog Day"" sort of theme. That in tuning out much of what life has to offer we miss life itself. Since this cold detached way of living is what most of us do (at least to some degree) it tends to undermine any comic quality the film might have. Of course unless your taste in comedy runs to Sandler's usual focus on bodily functions it doesn't take much to do this anyway.Inexplicably, even at his most detached, patient and accepting people surround Michael. His wife (Beckinsale), his parents (Winkler and Kavner), and his children continue to love him despite the absence of any lovable qualities. Similar to those who love this film.Then again, what do I know?

With a plot that could have been culled from an array of anthology shows, or even a sketch comedy show (I did see it done on one), Sandler and co. tread on dangerous, often predictable ground.  The movie almost succeeds, but fails because it doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama.The film features a well intentioned father who is a workaholic that works hard because he believes it will ultimately be better for his family.  He wishes life were a lot easier and while out to purchase a universal remote for his TV, runs into the mysterious Morty who gives him a ""universal"" remote.  Supposedly, comedy should ensue.Here is where problems come in.  Watching Sandler glide through the future after his remote continually fast forwards, we are given dreary future events.  Occaisonally, there are spotty laughs, usually regarding sex or bodily function.  Either way, they are crude and inappropriate for the tone of the rest of the film.Then there are similarities between It's a Wonderful Life/Scrooge, and any number of stories that ask ""what if"" and in the end, present themselves as cautionary tales.  This film is very predictable from start to finish.There are moments to this film - and the big moment is Sandler.  Sandler has been positioned as a sort of everyman who somehow succeeds in all his films.  He has a likeability that allows him to succeed in spite of the material.  However, scripts often have lewd humor that keep Sandler from reaching his potential, as he did in Spanglish, Puch Drunk Love, and even in earlier comedies like the Wedding Singer.

""Happy Gilmore"" is still the best, but I enjoyed ""Click"" a lot. Sandler has matured quite a bit since his precocious beginning, and this role fits him well. Special effects are used to good advantage, and the Oscar nominated make-up of Rick Baker took this trip to the future with verve and imagination. I can think of many films that have had a similar theme (how would my life be if...), and ""Click"" has it's own personality. The acting is fine, with, I thought, Kate Beckinsale's finest performance, rife with wit and development. Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner are great together, and David Hasselhoff plays a parody of himself as if nothing else could be more fun. Christopher Walken, too, is fine as Morty, the catalyst of all the craziness. I thought the film was insightful, instructive and quite sweet-natured.

I happened to catch it on television a few months after its home video release, and it was a lot better than I thought it would be. Honestly, I don't understand the hate for this movie. I thought Adam Sandler actually gave a solid performance, with a decent range in emotion. In fact, I think this was one of his best, not that his others are much to compare to (with the exception of a couple). Don't take that the wrong way. I do like his some of movies, but I dislike more than I like. Unlike most of his others, Click was not all middle school jokes. Not all middle school jokes, but still too much for my taste. If there were not so much dog on duck action I would consider it a better film. Unfortunately it does have more than enough, so it becomes hard to take the film too seriously at first. I like it though, despite the flaws. I think the message is very good. A lot of business men and women do not put enough time aside for their families. I was reluctant, but ultimately liked the shifts in tone, from typical Happy Madison dumb comedy to grown up drama towards the end. The few sad scenes really struck a nerve with me. I felt sorry for Sandler's character when he could not do anything to help his situation, even as he began to discover the flaws in his personality and lifestyle.Click is obviously a comedy, but I don't necessarily like it for its comedic elements. There were three or four scenes that struck a nerve and made my eyes somewhat well up. I know, I know, but it's true. Hey if you were looking for the regular Sandler flick, then I understand your disappointment. I'm actually happy that he did something out of his norm, because his norm sucks! At times it ended up feeling a little like his other depressing movies Reign Over Me, and mostly Funny People. I liked that, because I like those two movies. The film is complicated, yet so simple. I really can't explain that statement, but hopefully if you were to watch it, you'd see what I mean. The plot was simple - A hard working architect busted his ass all day, and night, every day to provide the best possible life for his family. He also happened to be pushing them away in the process. So one night he goes on the journey of a life time in about an hour and twenty minutes, and comes out a new person. I appreciated the effort that went into the project, and the finished product as well. The transfer could use some work, but it's a great improvement over the DVD for sure.

Something about him had always managed to rub me the wrong way.However, the 'It's a wonderful life for the 21st century' basic premise of this movie---and the dangling premise of a finally more grown up Sandler effectively lured me in. I would not want to 'click' away this one.Michael Newman is an overworked architect who meets up with inventor Morty(Christopher Walken in an eccentric scientist role--invoking his 'Back to the Future' days) inside a very special section of a 'Bed, Bath, and Beyond' store.  It might sound campy to some people, but comes across as really minor precisely because the overall screenplay was written to actually be appealing.Heck, I even enjoyed David Hasselhoff's role as, Ammer, the slimmy boss from hell--whom Michael escapes from through the aid of that special remote. The irony of 'king of cheese' Hasselhoff of all people playing the role (and with an eerie perfection to boot) ultimately left me commiserating with Sandler. This is something I never expected to find myself doing in a million years. I previously would have denied even the vaguest possibility!Another memorable performance comes from Henry Winkler, who plays Ted Newman, Michael's dad.

You got your average Joe (Adam Sandler) working for a firm where he's busts his butt to get some recognition, plus some sort of promotion.  He's so focused on his job that he tends to neglect his family, canceling vacation plans and fails to show up for school events, etc. however, in the long run, he's working hard so that his family can have more.In reality, many people don't realize that they are inadvertently dissing their family while thinking that they are trying to be successful in their job. Many people don't see it, but that's why some spouses leave their husbands because they are never home for them or the children.  They don't know how to appreciate what they have because they always want more. Or, their superiors tell them that they will earn a promotion for continually conquering challenges thrown at them, while all the while, the superior enjoys all the benefits that the employee worked hard for. Most all employers are the evil puppeteers of this true reality that seems to break up homes.In this film, Morty is subsequently, the devil in the flesh.  He gives Michael Newman a remote control.  But, not one that controls his TV. It is one that controls his life. By using the remote control, he make all his own choices. What he wants to do, what he wants to skip. He just jumps ahead (with the skip chapter button on the remote) so he can get past the unpleasant things he wishes to avoid.  What he thinks should be just a few days, actually ends up being years into the future. Years of losing all the wonderful things he could have done with his family, if he didn't go and put his job first.The spin on this film that makes it so devastatingly real, is that, if we could skip all the unpleasantness of our lives we would just find ourselves deeper into the future, and no closer to gaining all that we strive for. In fact, we would only see what we've lost, when trying so hard to have more.So people have said, that ""this is not a comedy"". Well, comedy was there only to make it so it wouldn't be so depressing.  If all the comedy was taken out, this would feel like an extremely horrific episode of the ""Twilight Zone"" with all the outcomes of reality in tact.

But much like his other past dumb comedies, Click made into my DVD library. But unlike his previous movies, Sandler doesn't play the lovable loser. Instead he is a fairly successful architect who close to making partner and he already has the girl in the form of Kate Beckinsale (Serendipity) who seems to like to walk around in pajama short shorts and tight fitting shirt.Okay, so not everything is perfect as he is having trouble balancing his family and doing enough at work to be made partner. The pressure culminates when he has to do research on Asian architecture so he can land a prestigious Japanese client only to turn on a remote control car while trying to play a video on the subject. So it's time to a universal remote so he doesn't open his garage door every time he tries to turn on the television. But the only place that is open at the time is Bed, Bath, and Beyond where Sandler has to venture into the Beyond where he runs into the last person you want to meet at the end of a dark hallway, Mr. Cowbell himself, Christopher Walken.As anyone who saw the trailer can figure up, the remote that Walken gives Sandler is truly a universal remote as it gives Sandler the power to control his whole universe. He can fast forward threw fights with his wife, mute annoying people, and pause to kick someone in the crotch without them knowing (hey it's an Adam Sandler movie; you need your prerequisite object to the crotch). No remote control gag goes unused. Well except for close captioning. But anyways. Unfortunately for Sandler the remote comes with Tivo so it starts predicting his habits and starts to fast forwards even when he doesn't want to do so. And unfortunately for us as Sandler goes further in the future, the sappier the movie gets and almost plays out like A Christmas Carol with Walken playing all three ghosts.But luckily there are plenty of fart jokes and other sophomoric gags that you would expect from a Sandler movie that keeps the sappy parts from being unwatchable. Plus Sandler brings in some of his past coworker who knock the comedy out of the park including The Fonz (The Waterboy), Sean Austin (50 First Dates), Terry Crews (The Longest Yard), and of course Rob Schneider who seems to pop up in every of his movie, but you will have to look in the deleted scenes to hear his catchphrase, ""You can do it!"" The best cameo though goes to James Earl Jones who you will just have to see the movie to see how he is used.

I was half right.Like the trailer for the movie implies, in Click Adam Sandler does indeed acquire a remote controller that controls pretty much anything he wants to control with it. Sandler's signature style of humor is abundant, but the Billy Madison, adolescent humor is mostly out and some good adult humor is in, along with a pretty good story, a good cast and some good acting.There is an equal dose of comedy and drama in Click. If fact, Click plays more like a Twilight Zone episode than it does your average everyday routine comedy flick.I can hear Rod Serling introducing Click: ""Michael Newman. A man with a good family and a career moving in the right direction. Everything any man could ask for. But Michael is an impatient man. He wants to know how it all turns out; he wants to read the last 10 pages of his life story before he reads the first 390. He wants to see the end of the movie before watching it in its entirety. But in life, there are no short cuts to the final chapter.  Unless, of course, you take a short cut through a small door at the back of your local Bed Bath and Beyond. It's not the door marked Bed or Bath. It's the one marked Beyond. The one that leads you to a shortcut through...The Twilight Zone.""Click is a good movie that pushes the family emotions button (and would have made an excellent Twilight Zone episode).

Everything goes as planned until some things go terribly wrong...Adam Sandler and Kate Beckinsale play the main characters in the film and both act good. Sandler knows how to act comedy and does it well. Beckinsale is sweet and beautiful and does a nice acting job also.Christopher Walken and David Hasselholf are the surporting roles in the film. Walken feels a bit hold back and his character asks for more depth and a bit more acting, but still his performance is good enough that you don't mind it.Hasselhof plays a hilarious part and is really funny as the boss of Sandler's character.The film has some nice jokes here and there and explores the world of the Click device well enough, although some jokes do feel a bit over the top and weren't that necessary to put in the film. But the film is funny enough to make you laugh at some moments.Now the biggest problem with Click is that it is said to be a comedy, which it is for about the first hour, but then it makes a big switch and suddenly becomes a heavy drama film. The dramatic element is nice but still way too much for the ones who are expecting a comedy. There are some small jokes here and there in the dramatic part, but it doesn't feel like a comedy anymore. And if there is a comedy moment in that second part of the film it feels totally out of place, like the most dramatic scene of the entire film is broken into a thousand pieces because of a stupid joke that really feels unnecessary. Also, for the younger members of the family the dramatic part can be a bit too much and too serious.Click may not be sutible for the smallest members of the family because of the drama and of some pretty sexual jokes and sexy moments in the film. So mind the PG-13 rating. If you are a bit older you may enjoy those jokes a lot more.So all in all: Click has become a nice comedy with an extreme cool idea that is well worked out but with a bit too much drama considering it's a comedy.

1015784,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000HRMCUC,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","Adam Sandler became famous playing comical, crude, and manic characters.  But, like many comedians, Sandler has illustrated that he isn't just a funny man and is able to handle more serious, dramatic material, too.  Showing that his dramatic turn in PUNCH DRUNK LOVE wasn't just a one-time fluke, Sandler stars in CLICK, a transition piece for the actor that allowed him to display his dramatic acting chops but not completely forsaking his comic roots.  CLICK can best be described as a cross between IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and the classic medieval tale of Faustus.Sandler portrays a young architect named Michael Newman.  Michael works for an incredibly pompous man named Ammer (David Hasselhoff).  Michael is a man who doesn't know how to say no to Ammer's requests and finds himself spending more and more time at work.  Professionally, it has started to provide benefits, but at the cost of alienating himself from his family.Deeply frustrated one evening with all the lack of control the different remote controls in his house seem to have (as well as the lack of control he seems to have with his life), Michael sets out to a Bed, Bath, and Beyond (can you say product placement) to find a universal remote.  Michael finds himself wandering into the darkest corners of the ""Beyond"" part of the store where he meet Morty (Christopher Walken).  Morty gives Michael a truly universal remote. It solves his remote control problem.  However, as Michael soon learns, the universal remote also works with his real life.  He is able to mute his wife during arguments, fast forward through boring family dinners, or pause a moment in time to perform a practical joke.  Michael thinks the remote is the greatest thing in the world until he learns that the remote begins operating upon memory and then Michael's life truly runs out of control.CLICK is a decent movie.  It has some funny moments, but it's also a dramatic film with a positive message about appreciating the simple, yet finer things in life.  The acting by the entire cast is well done and though there are a few cruder moments of humor (typical of a Sandler picture) there isn't anything outrageous.  I will say that about three-fourths of the way into the movie things became somewhat confusing for me, but after thinking and talking about the movie later things became clear.Overall, CLICK is a must-see for Sandler diehards and just a regular entertaining movie for everyone else.",4,More Like FAUST than IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.,1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,2444,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'became', 'famous', 'playing', 'comical', 'crude', 'manic', 'characters', 'many', 'comedians', 'Sandler', 'illustrated', ""n't"", 'just', 'funny', 'man', 'able', 'handle', 'more', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'material', 'too', 'Showing', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'PUNCH', 'DRUNK', 'LOVE', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'one-time', 'fluke', 'Sandler', 'CLICK', 'transition', 'piece', 'actor', 'allowed', 'display', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'chops', 'not', 'completely', 'forsaking', 'comic', 'roots', 'CLICK', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'cross', 'IT', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', 'classic', 'medieval', 'tale', 'Faustus.Sandler', 'young', 'architect', 'named', 'Michael', 'Newman', 'Michael', 'incredibly', 'pompous', 'man', 'named', 'Ammer', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'Michael', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'say', 'Ammer', 'requests', 'spending', 'more', 'more', 'time', 'work', 'Professionally', 'started', 'provide', 'benefits', 'cost', 'alienating', 'family.Deeply', 'frustrated', 'one', 'evening', 'lack', 'control', 'different', 'remote', 'controls', 'house', 'seem', 'have', 'as', 'well', 'lack', 'control', 'have', 'life', 'Michael', 'out', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'can', 'say', 'product', 'placement', 'find', 'universal', 'remote', 'Michael', 'wandering', 'darkest', 'corners', 'Beyond', 'part', 'store', 'where', 'meet', 'Morty', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Morty', 'Michael', 'truly', 'universal', 'remote', 'remote', 'control', 'problem', 'However', 'Michael', 'soon', 'universal', 'remote', 'also', 'real', 'life', 'able', 'mute', 'wife', 'arguments', 'fast', 'forward', 'boring', 'family', 'dinners', 'pause', 'moment', 'time', 'perform', 'practical', 'joke', 'Michael', 'remote', 'greatest', 'thing', 'world', 'remote', 'operating', 'memory', 'then', 'Michael', 'life', 'truly', 'control.CLICK', 'decent', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'also', 'dramatic', 'film', 'positive', 'message', 'appreciating', 'simple', 'yet', 'finer', 'things', 'life', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'few', 'cruder', 'moments', 'humor', 'typical', 'Sandler', 'picture', ""n't"", 'anything', 'outrageous', 'will', 'say', 'about', 'three-fourths', 'way', 'movie', 'things', 'became', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'thinking', 'talking', 'movie', 'later', 'things', 'became', 'clear.Overall', 'CLICK', 'must-see', 'Sandler', 'diehards', 'just', 'regular', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'everyone', 'else']",N/A

At first this was helpful and convenient for him, but all too soon, the remote programming begins to take on a life of it's own, from what he originally programmed it to do.The story is a modern take of scrooge in many ways reminding me of that theme.

Although the outcome was very predictable, no suspense or disguise at all, the material in between was entertaining.  Adam sandler plays Michael, a father who has had work become a priority over his family.  The weekend of the fourth of july, Michael gets assigned a huge work project, and decided to cancel his families planned fourth of july camping trip to work.  During the course of that evening, he gets frustrated with all of his remotes trying to watch a video for work, and set of to find a Universal remote. Being late, the only store that happened to be open was Bed,Bath, and Beyond.  Well, little did he know he would be involve in discovering just what ""beyond"" stands for.  Christopher Walken plays the store attendant that helps him get his remote, which turns out to be a remote to control his universe.  From their, the movie takes off as we see him trying to control his universe.  Beware though, the remote will ""auto progrom"" , and he gets his life turined upside down once the remote learns his habits.Yes the ending was predictable, and I am left to wonder why he just didn't reprogram the remote, IE change his habits or pust some of the other buttons, but the movie is what it is.

1015795,AP3B615GM191G,B000HRMCUC,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","When one thinks of an Adam Sandler film, the phrase ""juvenile humor"" immediately comes to mind, filled with low-brow humor and outlandish acting.  Fortunately, ""Click"" is a departure (for the most part) from that categorization by providing an interesting story, developed characters, and very solid acting.For a basic plot summary, ""Click"" sees Michael Newman (Sandler) struggling to find time for his family while wearing himself out for his never-impressed boss.  On a routine trip to find a universal TV remote, Michael runs into a crazy scientist (played by Christopher Walken) who gives him a ""universal remote"", alright...one that can control his entire life!  Hilarity, emotions, & hijinks ensue.Besides the novel concept, this movie outshines other Sandler flicks due to its heart.  While shaping up (in the early goings) to be a hijinks comedy, somewhere along the way a heavy dose of emotion is thrown into the proceedings.  By the end of the film, the viewer will actually care about the main characters and want to see their resolutions.Granted, ""Click"" does still contain some of the typical Sandler low-brow humor, but it isn't too over-the-top or suffocating.  Far outweighing that aspect is the above-average acting from pretty much the entire cast, which produces a real connection between characters and audience.Overall, ""Click"" is a fun little movie (though not for the younger kiddies) that may (at least in a small way) change your perception of Mr. Sandler.  This isn't his goofy ""Waterboy"" or farcical ""Billy Madison"".
