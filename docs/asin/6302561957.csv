But it's still a great film otherwise about a mother who gives up her son and is picked up by the tramp Chaplin. He takes care of him until a doctor warns him about proper care. When the law tries to take the kid away from Chaplin, he does everything he can to retreat him. Finally, the mother and child meet at the end of the film. It also includes an OK Chaplin short where Chaplin plays two roles. One is a rich sort of bachelor to remarry his ex-wife, and one is a tramp who plays golf and comes to a costume party to have some fun, when the two of them mix up.

The Gold Rush, City Lights). It has its funny moments, but they do not approach anywhere near the pinnacles seen in some of his later works; they provide more of a chuckle than the uncontrollable laughter that results from watching some his later ones.There were some very touching sceens in the movie, and the acting was pretty good, from both Chaplin and the kid.  Still, when I finished watching it, I didn't feel like I had just watched a great movie; I felt like I had watched an acceptable one (there was also a little too much Christian imagery in the film for my taste, but I'll take it as a sign of the times).Anyway, if you're new to Chaplin I suggest that you see something like City Lights first; this film is fairly good, but it's not among his best.As for &quot;The Idle Class&quot;, it's a pretty good Chaplin short that has its definite highlight in the scene where the tramp goes golfing and finds that he forgot to bring a ball.

320798,A1YWBPN6CIZU7N,6302561957,"Obi ""Obi wan liberali""","[1, 1]","Perhaps not as polished as ""City Lights"" and ""The Gold Rush"", this movie tells an interesting story about an orphan boy (played by a very young Jackie Coogan or Fester as his friends call him) who gets abandoned by his mother, played by Edna Purviance, and finds himself in the care of a tramp played by you know who.  There are many usual early Chaplin features such as a good fight scene and bumbling police officers ala the ""Keystone Cops"" and hard-headed bureaucratic types. Well to make it short, despite much drama, the kid gets reunited with his mother and all ends well.Matched with a fun little short, ""The Idle Class"", Chaplin spoofs the well-healed and their penchant for playing golf and partying.  In a case of mistaken identity, the tramp and a millionaire find themselves in the same resort and some funny drama ensues with Edna Purviance in the middle of it.  The golf scene is very funny and the sight of the millionaire character finding himself in a phone booth without any pants on is enough to conjur up terrifying dreams of the past.Both movies are very entertaining and my little girls love to watch them both, laughing themselves silly at numerous scenes.  The score is also really good.  Chaplin really had a good feel for what music goes well with each scene.
