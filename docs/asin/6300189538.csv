206611,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300189538,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","My American Cousin, 1985 filmThe story starts with a girl complaining ""nothing ever happens"". Her parents worry about money and bills. [The manual accounting machine dates this movie.] The music says the summer of 1959. At night Rich Walkers shows up alone on vacation. [A surprise!] Can he help out? Is he in trouble? ""No sir."" He has a red Cadillac convertible! [Note the 630 box camera.] The family takes pictures. The cherry orchard needs harvesting. [No migrant labor?] ""You guys still need some help?"" Teenage girl Sandy is rebellious. [Too proud?] She's almost thirteen (not a child). ""Rattlesnakes?"" He father tries to explain ""uncontrollable urges"". ""Its complicated."" Sandy is full of self-pity. The radio in the states plays rock `n' roll all day. How old? The boy in the wheelchair suggests polio.We see the life of this family. [How normal are they?] The radio plays ""Summertime Blues"", a complaint about teenage life. Butch has the DA haircut that was in style then. No dirt roads in the states? [Not on country roads.] Did Butch run away from home? The small talk tells of their shallowness. Those teenage girls ride in the back. His girlfriend lost it in the back seat. That earring. ""Slow down."" Racing on a country road attracts the police. But Butch takes a detour! ""I made it again."" [The danger in riding with a stranger?] They walk to a lake and go into the water. They talk about a singer and his wife. A snappy car? [Who pays for the gas? No prices at a gas station?] Butch's mother said he stole her car. [Note the sword over the fireplace.] His parents will arrive tomorrow to take him back. Do these problems go on for each generation? [Unbelievable?]Sandy has the keys! But must still push. They go to a public dance. [Do they still have them in rural areas?] Does Butch think he can do anything? He drives to park with Shirley. Sandy talks to the other girls. Shirley used to live in Toronto. They kiss. The teenagers do the latest dance to the latest music. [They think for themselves? No mention of a popular TV show for teenagers.] Shirley knows her limits. ""Will there be fireworks later on?"" Local boys go looking for Butch. Sandy hides from her father. She has a lot of explaining to do. Lenny meets Butch, they argue and fight. A crowd watches. Having a good time? Where is Sandy? Can they run away from home without any money? Out of gas. Is being a teenager the best time of your life? [Not really.] His parents come to take Butch home. [Are they caricatures?] ""What a view!"" ""I love tea"" says Butch's mother. [A comment on manners.] Sandra runs down the hill. Will she be disappointed again? [Does unhappiness come from wanting what you can't get? Or from getting it?] ""Boys are like buses, if you miss one another will come along."" The last scenes tell about the rest of the story. Her Mom was right!This is at best an average history of the late 1950s, based on a novel. The talk about a transistor radio ignores the earlier portable radios that used a 6 volt A battery and a 45 volt B battery. Was it written to attract a larger American audience? ""American Graffiti"" was better. It tells about the experiences of Canadians in the western provinces of that era. Those who grew up in small towns or farming communities will have a different background from those near a big city. I think ""country and western"" was more popular than rock `n' roll in small farming towns then.",2,Sandy's Summertime Sadness,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,3415,"['American', 'Cousin', '1985', 'filmThe', 'story', 'girl', 'complaining', 'nothing', 'ever', 'parents', 'worry', 'money', 'bills', '[', 'manual', 'accounting', 'machine', 'movie', ']', 'music', 'summer', '1959', 'night', 'Rich', 'Walkers', 'up', 'alone', 'vacation', '[', 'surprise', ']', 'Can', 'help', 'out', 'trouble', 'sir', 'red', 'Cadillac', 'convertible', '[', 'Note', '630', 'box', 'camera', ']', 'family', 'pictures', 'cherry', 'orchard', 'harvesting', '[', 'migrant', 'labor', ']', 'guys', 'still', 'need', 'help', 'Teenage', 'girl', 'Sandy', 'rebellious', '[', 'Too', 'proud', 'almost', 'thirteen', 'not', 'child', 'Rattlesnakes', 'tries', 'explain', 'uncontrollable', 'urges', 'complicated', 'Sandy', 'full', 'self-pity', 'radio', 'states', 'plays', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'day', 'How', 'old', 'boy', 'wheelchair', 'polio.We', 'see', 'life', 'family', '[', 'How', 'normal', 'are', ']', 'radio', 'Summertime', 'Blues', 'complaint', 'teenage', 'life', 'Butch', 'DA', 'haircut', 'was', 'style', 'then', 'No', 'dirt', 'roads', 'states', '[', 'Not', 'country', 'roads', ']', 'Did', 'Butch', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'small', 'talk', 'tells', 'shallowness', 'teenage', 'girls', 'ride', 'back', 'girlfriend', 'lost', 'back', 'seat', 'earring', 'Slow', 'down', 'Racing', 'country', 'road', 'police', 'Butch', 'detour', 'made', 'again', 'danger', 'riding', 'stranger', 'walk', 'lake', 'go', 'water', 'talk', 'singer', 'wife', 'snappy', 'car', '[', 'Who', 'gas', 'prices', 'gas', 'station', ']', 'Butch', 'mother', 'said', 'stole', 'car', 'Note', 'sword', 'fireplace', ']', 'parents', 'will', 'arrive', 'tomorrow', 'take', 'back', 'Do', 'problems', 'go', 'generation', 'Unbelievable', ']', 'Sandy', 'keys', 'must', 'still', 'push', 'go', 'public', 'dance', 'Do', 'still', 'have', 'rural', 'areas', ']', 'Butch', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'park', 'Shirley', 'Sandy', 'talks', 'other', 'girls', 'Shirley', 'used', 'live', 'Toronto', 'kiss', 'teenagers', 'do', 'latest', 'dance', 'latest', 'music', 'think', 'mention', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'teenagers', ']', 'Shirley', 'limits', 'Will', 'be', 'fireworks', 'later', 'Local', 'boys', 'go', 'looking', 'Butch', 'Sandy', 'father', 'lot', 'explaining', 'do', 'Lenny', 'meets', 'Butch', 'argue', 'fight', 'crowd', 'watches', 'Having', 'good', 'time', 'Where', 'Sandy', 'Can', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'money', 'gas', 'being', 'teenager', 'best', 'time', 'life', '[', 'Not', 'really', ']', 'parents', 'come', 'take', 'Butch', 'home', '[', 'Are', 'caricatures', ']', 'What', 'view', 'love', 'tea', 'Butch', 'mother', '[', 'comment', 'manners', ']', 'Sandra', 'down', 'hill', 'Will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'again', '[', 'Does', 'unhappiness', 'come', 'wanting', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'getting', 'Boys', 'are', 'like', 'buses', 'miss', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'along', 'last', 'scenes', 'tell', 'rest', 'story', 'Mom', 'was', 'right', 'best', 'average', 'history', 'late', '1950s', 'based', 'novel', 'talk', 'transistor', 'radio', 'earlier', 'portable', 'radios', 'used', '6', 'volt', 'battery', '45', 'volt', 'B', 'battery', 'Was', 'written', 'attract', 'larger', 'American', 'audience', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'was', 'better', 'experiences', 'Canadians', 'western', 'provinces', 'era', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'small', 'towns', 'farming', 'communities', 'will', 'have', 'different', 'background', 'big', 'city', 'think', 'country', 'western', 'was', 'more', 'popular', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'small', 'farming', 'towns', 'then']",My American Cousin VHS

206613,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6300189538,Bomojaz,"[4, 4]","Set in Canada in 1959, 12-year-old Sandy's life is a crashing bore until her 18-year-old American cousin shows up in his red Cadillac. She quickly develops a crush on him, though he is more interested in the older town girls. He is rich and spoiled, and eventually his parents come to get him before he gets into serious trouble. The picture is very faithfully told through the eyes of a 12-year-old, but the movie raises no issues or makes any statement--Sandy doesn't seem to change much because of her cousin's visit. As a dramatic vehicle the movie is pretty static, like a What I Did on My Summer Vacation school composition. Well done, though, as far as it goes.",3,Through the eyes of a 12-year-old,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,668,"['Set', 'Canada', '1959', '12-year-old', 'Sandy', 'life', 'crashing', 'bore', '18-year-old', 'American', 'cousin', 'up', 'red', 'Cadillac', 'quickly', 'crush', 'more', 'interested', 'older', 'town', 'girls', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'eventually', 'parents', 'come', 'get', 'serious', 'trouble', 'picture', 'very', 'faithfully', 'told', 'eyes', '12-year-old', 'movie', 'issues', 'statement', 'Sandy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'change', 'much', 'cousin', 'visit', 'dramatic', 'vehicle', 'movie', 'pretty', 'static', 'What', 'Did', 'My', 'Summer', 'Vacation', 'school', 'composition', 'Well', 'done', 'though', 'as', 'far']",My American Cousin VHS
206614,A3QTP2CI1BDV0M,6300189538,"Jim O'Brien ""JamesMark""","[14, 14]","This is a good movie.  A low budget movie, it is better than 95% of the big budget movies.  It succeeds perhaps because it is the personal real-life story of the movie's writer/director/co-producer Sandy Wilson...or maybe it is because they had Margaret Langrick playing the part of Sandy Wilcox, a 12 year old girl going on 26...but whatever the reason, My American Cousin charms us.Locals and other non-actors were used for minor roles and extras, and this gives a feel of authenticity to the movie.  Indeed, it is easy, as a viewer, to imagine a cameraman hiding nearby while simply filming the activities in this small Canadian town.  And this is never more true than when Margaret Langrick is in a scene.  Her naturalness is amazing.  She captures the angst of an intelligent but frustrated 12 year old perfectly.The movie does make a mis-step however.  There's a sex scene with Butch and Shirley.  No flesh is shown, but the deed clearly is done...and it spoils things.  Why the movie's creator, Sandy Wilson, forced this scene in there is hard to figure, as it is unnecessary and out of place.  And it's sad because, with this scene in there, you can't show the movie to your kids; but, without this scene, it would be a great movie for kids...especially 11, 12, and 13 year old girls who believe that no one understands them.",5,This Movie Is Charming,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,1333,"['good', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'better', '95', '%', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'personal', 'real-life', 'story', 'movie', 'writer/director/co-producer', 'Sandy', 'Wilson', 'maybe', 'had', 'Margaret', 'Langrick', 'playing', 'part', 'Sandy', 'Wilcox', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'going', '26', 'reason', 'American', 'Cousin', 'charms', 'us.Locals', 'other', 'non-actors', 'were', 'used', 'minor', 'roles', 'extras', 'feel', 'authenticity', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'easy', 'viewer', 'imagine', 'cameraman', 'hiding', 'nearby', 'simply', 'filming', 'activities', 'small', 'Canadian', 'town', 'never', 'more', 'true', 'when', 'Margaret', 'Langrick', 'scene', 'naturalness', 'amazing', 'angst', 'intelligent', 'frustrated', '12', 'year', 'old', 'perfectly.The', 'movie', 'make', 'mis-step', 'however', 'sex', 'scene', 'Butch', 'Shirley', 'flesh', 'shown', 'deed', 'clearly', 'done', 'things', 'Why', 'movie', 'creator', 'Sandy', 'Wilson', 'forced', 'scene', 'hard', 'figure', 'unnecessary', 'place', 'sad', 'scene', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'show', 'movie', 'kids', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'kids', 'especially', '11', '12', '13', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'who', 'believe', 'one']",My American Cousin VHS
206615,AR1T36GLLAFFX,6300189538,Scott FS,"[1, 2]","I first saw this years ago on PBS.  I'm now older and married, and I wanted my wife to watch this sweet film.Even years later, this movie is as good as when I first watched it in the late 1980s.It's only available on VHS, but the film quality is good and you're not watching it for the special effects or anything.  Margaret Langrick plays the cute but bored pre-teen Sandy Wilcox.  She lives in a typical rural area of British Columbia, on a cherry orchard.  One day, her cousin Butch shows up, driving a huge and beautiful Cadillac convertible.  He's bored too, and seems to have driven to Canada on a lark to see his north-of-the-border relations.Sandy is at first repelled by Butch, then fascinated, then intrigued by this free-wheelin' guy with the cool clothes and the fancy car.  Butch doesn't seem to know what he wants, except girls and a good time.Highly recommended. There are some tense scenes of teenage angst, but it's mild.  Young kids won't be interested, but pre-teens and even teenagers might enjoy it.  (I was an adult when I first watched it, and I was charmed.)  One reviewer said there was a sex scene in the movie.  I certainly don't remember a sex scene.  I do remember Butch and his date 'making out' as they used to call it.
