The first time I watched it, I almost hurt myself laughing at the whole Brown clan.  I love Madea, but Madea ain't got nuthin on Brown.The family gathers to have a funeral for Pop Brown, and as many people know, funerals are filled with more drama than day-time televison.  There is cheating, unforgiveness, and jealousy.  At the center is the very lovable Brown and his daughter Cora.David Mann and Tamela Mann are great in this play.  Not only do they showcase great acting ability, they can ""sang"" like it ain't nobody's business.  The rest of the cast are wonderful, and there are truly no weak links to this cast.I could go on and on about how great this play is, but see it for yourself.

The play opens up with the Brown family in their living room. They fear that Mr. Browns 107 year old father has passed away.  Basically, the play is about this family and their many differences. One young black male relative is a doctor.  His uncle says crazy things, ""Oh so you are a gonoreochologist.""  I guess that's supposed to be funny.  They are a stereotyped black family in a sense.  You have the country acting older clan and the more refined, almost nose in the air younger generation.  One of the younger women, portrayed by Tamika Scott of X-Scape has money.  You think you are going to see some depth with her character early in the play.  The women sing a song titled, ""Nothing Wrong With A Good Man.""  This play, what can I say, it's no ""Raisin In The Sun,"" but it provides the same kind of entertainment as a blaxpoitation film.  I am in no way dissing Tyler Perry, I admire his work, it's just so much seems bufoonish at time.  But hey--I'm sure there are families that are similar with the Browns.  The play had an addictive quality, you want to watch it until the end.  I didn't quite find it as funny as some of the Madea plays I have seen but it's cool.  Another thing I thought I would mention, Mr. Brown isn't on the stage as much as the many women in the play.The DVD quality is great.  This is one of the DVD's released as part of the Tyler Perry collection.  The audio is great too.

Through planning his funeral, many different problems and issues arise within the family including a lonely woman who ends up finding love, a woman torn up inside because of her murdered child along with a husband whom she has tensions with, a husband who has cheated on his wife, and three sibilings as well as the whole of the Brown family who in the end discover the importance of family.
