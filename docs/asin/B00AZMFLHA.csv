1619121,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AZMFLHA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","The idea of kids being forced into war and brutality is certainly a harrowing one.  Many films, either directly of indirectly, have tackled the truth and unpleasantness of this unimaginable horror.  These stories rarely qualify as entertainment but as something much more important.  They make you confront humanity itself and face a world in which this is not only possible but commonplace.  One of my favorite films on the topic is the little-seen ""Johnny Mad Dog"" from 2008 (although favorite might be the wrong word, maybe most impactful).  This blunt force drama about child soldiers in Liberia is such an exhausting and disturbing experience, it has resonated with me even years afterwards.  With the acclaim of Kim Ngyyen's ""War Witch,"" I expected a similarly assaulting film.  Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of graphic violence and brutality in this examination of a young girl's life.  But the picture also has a gentler and more hopeful side, even as its environment has little room for tenderness and human connection.  Although based in an undisclosed African nation, this film is actually from Canada and was a 2013 Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film.  And at its heart, it is a strong story of survival amidst the worst conditions possible.""War Witch"" covers a few crucial years in the life of a girl named Komona.  At the age of 12, Komona is abducted into the rebel army from her village with a stunning act of violence.  The children are used alternately as slave labor and as killing machines, given no option other than to be ruthless warriors.  Komona is haunted by past acts and has visions which bring her to the attention of a powerful warlord.  Thus, she is dubbed a witch and her prophesies are trusted to keep the rebel leader victorious.  At camp, she grows closer to a young man (dubbed the magician) who takes a keen interest in our heroine.  And what is most unexpected in this tale of savagery is the possibility of hope and even love.  As Komona's story continues, she faces many important crossroads.  Can you escape a life like this one?  Can you escape the memories that haunt you?  If so, how?  And is it even a land worth living in?  There are many moments of humor and joy along the way, but happiness is never far removed from atrocity.  I won't give anything away, but ""War Witch"" does present a different side to a familiar story.Critical to the success of ""War Witch"" is actress Rachel Mwanza in the lead role.  Over the course of the years, she is transformed significantly several times and is always believable.  As I said, the movie is both harsh and hopeful and it's an unusual combination.  Depicting such a difficult and tumultuous world can't be an easy task, but Nguyen's film gets into the soul of Komona.  There are no simple resolutions to be presented.  Some might even think the film lacks a concrete ending.  We simply leave the story at some point along the journey.  But what is presented is fresh and provocative.  While ""War Witch"" certainly won't appeal to everyone, it is a strong and memorable excursion into a waking nightmare.  But unlike some stories of this type, this one is balanced by an unlikely gentleness that works very well.

Mood and atmosphere are conveyed consistently through the work of the camera, the setting of the scenes, and the moments of emotional communication by the actors. In a suppressive environment, the subtlest of gestures takes on deeper layers of meaning. This is an entirely inspired piece of film-making.

Forced to murder her parents and then, along with a group of other captured children, given guns and taught to fight, the young girl somehow manages to survive and develop a friendship with an albino boy who is a fellow child slave.  Somehow they escape for a while and develop a sweet romantic relationship but they are soon captured, the boy is murdered and the girl becomes the sex slave of the rebel leader who impregnates her.  The story continues with one horror after another with the young pregnant girl trying to get back to her village to bury her parents properly.

1619125,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00AZMFLHA,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","****1/2In the harrowing, Oscar-nominated Canadian drama ""War Witch,"" a young African girl is conscripted into a band of armed rebels, ordered by them to kill her own parents, then forced, along with the other children in her village, to fight against the government forces they're opposing. Because she seemingly has some sort of psychic visions of where the enemy is hiding in the woods (it's actually hallucinations brought on by a psychotropic liquid she imbibes from some local plants), she earns the position of personal ""witch"" to the chief rebel himself - a position that brings with it special protection as well (at least up to a point). But that's only the beginning of Komona's ordeal as she hooks up with an albino ""magician"" (the excellent Serge Kanyinda) with whom she tries to flee the horrors of the world around them.And it is those very horrors - the nonstop terror and violence, and the ever present prospect of sudden death - that writer/director Kim Nguyen captures to such powerful effect in this film. Despite its occasional forays into the surreal, what one takes away most from ""War Witch"" is its unflinching willingness to confront the brutal realities of life for Komona and the countless others who share her predicament. Then there are the occasional acts of random kindness that allow hope to flourish even in the most horrible of circumstances.And all throughout her ordeal, Komona must find a way to bury, both literally and figuratively, the ghosts of the parents she killed.Rachel Mwanza is utterly amazing as Komona, and she richly deserved all the praise and awards heaped on her for her performance. Whether it's her heartbreaking narration to her unborn child or the understated way in which she reacts to and internally processes the unspeakable atrocities she both witnesses and is forced to commit, Mwanza embodies a much larger tragedy within the narrower confines of a single character.It may be hard to watch at times, but ""War Witch"" provides an invaluable reminder of what happens when we send our children off to war.",4,Gripping view of life in a war-torn land,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,2064,"['harrowing', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Canadian', 'drama', 'War', 'Witch', 'young', 'African', 'girl', 'conscripted', 'band', 'armed', 'rebels', 'ordered', 'kill', 'own', 'parents', 'then', 'forced', 'other', 'children', 'village', 'fight', 'government', ""'re"", 'opposing', 'seemingly', 'sort', 'psychic', 'visions', 'where', 'enemy', 'hiding', 'woods', 'actually', 'hallucinations', 'brought', 'psychotropic', 'liquid', 'local', 'plants', 'position', 'personal', 'witch', 'chief', 'rebel', 'position', 'special', 'protection', 'as', 'well', 'least', 'up', 'point', 'only', 'beginning', 'Komona', 'ordeal', 'up', 'albino', 'magician', 'excellent', 'Serge', 'Kanyinda', 'whom', 'flee', 'horrors', 'world', 'them.And', 'very', 'horrors', 'nonstop', 'terror', 'violence', 'ever', 'present', 'prospect', 'sudden', 'death', 'writer/director', 'Kim', 'Nguyen', 'such', 'powerful', 'effect', 'film', 'occasional', 'forays', 'surreal', 'what', 'one', 'away', 'most', 'War', 'Witch', 'unflinching', 'willingness', 'confront', 'brutal', 'realities', 'life', 'Komona', 'countless', 'others', 'who', 'share', 'predicament', 'Then', 'are', 'occasional', 'acts', 'random', 'kindness', 'allow', 'hope', 'flourish', 'even', 'most', 'horrible', 'circumstances.And', 'ordeal', 'Komona', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'bury', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'ghosts', 'parents', 'killed.Rachel', 'Mwanza', 'utterly', 'amazing', 'Komona', 'richly', 'deserved', 'praise', 'awards', 'heaped', 'performance', 'heartbreaking', 'narration', 'unborn', 'child', 'understated', 'way', 'internally', 'unspeakable', 'atrocities', 'witnesses', 'forced', 'commit', 'Mwanza', 'much', 'larger', 'tragedy', 'narrower', 'confines', 'single', 'character.It', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'War', 'Witch', 'invaluable', 'reminder', 'what', 'when', 'send', 'children', 'war']",War Witch
1619126,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00AZMFLHA,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""Rebelle"" (also known as ""War Witch"") is a Canadian film in French language, set in some unspecified country in Africa (actually filmed on location in Democratic Republic of the Congo). And its heroine, a 14-year-old girl named Komona, is a child soldier. Komona, pregnant, recounts to her unborn baby two years of her life since she was abducted by the rebels led by the Great Tiger (Mizinga Mwinga).Written and directed by Kim Nguyen, the film eschews some conventional elements in storytelling like plot details, in favor of mood and atmosphere. ""Rebelle"" follows the events that happen to Komona, some of which are horrible, just as seen from the girl's viewpoint, without graphic descriptions.Some may say ""Rebelle"" is a love story. Another child soldier ""Magician"" (Serge Kanyinda) asks her to marry him. The film also blurs the line between the real and the mystical. Komona can see the ghosts including those of her own parents, and hear what they say. Rachel Mwanza, who was living on the streets of Kinshasa before appearing in this movie, delivers a convincing portrayal of Komona as a child solider called the ""witch.""The approach to the subject matter is totally unique in ""Rebelle,"" an Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film category though it may not be to everyone's taste.

It's by a Canadian-based writer, Kim Nguyen, who has a proffered up a most harrowing and disturbing tale of the abduction of a 12 year old girl by a band of criminals who call themselves 'rebels' and how they transform this girl and other children into armed and vicious soldiers.The film begins with an unbearably difficult scene to watch. Komona (the protagonist played by the very talented newcomer, Rachel Mwanza) is forced to kill her own parents and later, she and other abducted children are issued AK-47s, where they're forced to fight government soldiers who are pursuing them.An albino child-soldier, Magician, gives Komona a tree sap that induces hallucinatory visions. Throughout the film, Komona has visions of her murdered parents, painted all in white. Early on, she escapes from the government soldiers after she's warned by these visions of her parents. Due to this escape, the leader of the so-called 'rebels', Great Tiger, declares her a 'war witch' and none of Great Tiger's soldiers are allowed to whip Komona. Nonetheless, she still is forced to dig for coltan, a metallic ore which is considered one of the ""blood minerals"", which these roving gangs of criminals are fighting over.At a certain point, Komona runs off with Magician, who is determined to marry her. At the midpoint, there's some comic relief, where Magician must find a 'white rooster', to consummate the marriage ritual. Before the young couple attains marital bliss, Great Tiger's men track down Magician and kill him with a machete for running off with Komona. She's returned to Great Tiger and she kills him inside a tent by castrating him as he attempts to rape her.The final third of the film has Komona escaping from Great Tiger's men and giving birth to Magician's baby. I suppose the ending is meant to be sort of a hopeful release from all the horrible things we see earlier in the film. But is it realistic? Wouldn't Great Tiger's men come after Komona as they came after her lover before?Despite the shortcomings of the film's climax, it's still a powerful chronicle of what's going on in some parts of the world today. While you may expect some entity to come in and save these forsaken children in the near future, you probably should hope again. Outsiders don't want to get involved since they'd be putting their own lives on the line for people they're not connected to. The local government forces are so ineffectual or overwhelmed, that they're impotent in the face of these dangerous hoodlums. In this case, offering up some prayers might be the only logical course of action when dealing with this overwhelmingly tragic situation.",4,Disturbing and gripping expos&eacute; of child soldiers in Central Africa,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,2767,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'War"", 'Witch', 'set', 'somewhere', 'central', 'Africa', 'particular', 'country', 'identified', 'Canadian-based', 'writer', 'Kim', 'Nguyen', 'who', 'proffered', 'up', 'most', 'harrowing', 'disturbing', 'tale', 'abduction', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'band', 'criminals', 'who', 'call', 'how', 'transform', 'girl', 'other', 'children', 'armed', 'vicious', 'soldiers.The', 'film', 'unbearably', 'difficult', 'scene', 'watch', 'Komona', 'protagonist', 'played', 'very', 'talented', 'newcomer', 'Rachel', 'Mwanza', 'forced', 'kill', 'own', 'parents', 'later', 'other', 'abducted', 'children', 'are', 'issued', 'AK-47s', 'where', ""'re"", 'forced', 'fight', 'government', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'pursuing', 'them.An', 'albino', 'child-soldier', 'Magician', 'Komona', 'tree', 'sap', 'hallucinatory', 'visions', 'film', 'Komona', 'visions', 'murdered', 'parents', 'painted', 'white', 'Early', 'government', 'soldiers', 'warned', 'visions', 'parents', 'Due', 'escape', 'leader', 'so-called', ""'rebels"", 'Great', 'Tiger', ""'war"", 'witch', 'none', 'Great', 'Tiger', 'soldiers', 'are', 'allowed', 'whip', 'Komona', 'Nonetheless', 'still', 'forced', 'dig', 'coltan', 'metallic', 'ore', 'considered', 'one', 'blood', 'minerals', 'roving', 'gangs', 'criminals', 'are', 'fighting', 'certain', 'point', 'Komona', 'Magician', 'who', 'determined', 'marry', 'midpoint', 'comic', 'relief', 'where', 'Magician', 'must', 'find', ""'white"", 'rooster', 'consummate', 'marriage', 'ritual', 'young', 'couple', 'attains', 'marital', 'bliss', 'Great', 'Tiger', 'men', 'track', 'down', 'Magician', 'kill', 'machete', 'running', 'off', 'Komona', 'returned', 'Great', 'Tiger', 'tent', 'castrating', 'rape', 'her.The', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'Komona', 'escaping', 'Great', 'Tiger', 'men', 'giving', 'birth', 'Magician', 'baby', 'suppose', 'ending', 'meant', 'be', 'sort', 'hopeful', 'release', 'horrible', 'things', 'see', 'earlier', 'film', 'realistic', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Great', 'Tiger', 'men', 'come', 'Komona', 'came', 'lover', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'climax', 'still', 'powerful', 'chronicle', 'what', 'going', 'parts', 'world', 'today', 'may', 'expect', 'entity', 'come', 'save', 'forsaken', 'children', 'near', 'future', 'probably', 'should', 'hope', 'again', 'Outsiders', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'involved', ""'d"", 'be', 'putting', 'own', 'lives', 'line', 'people', ""'re"", 'not', 'connected', 'local', 'government', 'forces', 'are', 'so', 'ineffectual', 'overwhelmed', ""'re"", 'impotent', 'face', 'dangerous', 'hoodlums', 'case', 'offering', 'up', 'prayers', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'logical', 'course', 'action', 'when', 'dealing', 'overwhelmingly', 'tragic', 'situation']",War Witch
