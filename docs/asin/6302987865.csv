I hope they re-release the soundtrack too. I like the way the actors sing the songs better than the singers on the original soundtrack. Anyway if you never seen this movie here's the scoop from imdb:Young Miranda Presley, an aspiring Country-singer/writer, comes to Nashville, Tennessee, to enter the weekly singer contest held at ""The Bluebird Cafe"". There she meets James Wright, an energetic, but somewhat chaotic young man, Kyle Davidson, a more laid-back kind of guy and Linda Lue Linden, who's career may not necessarily be in Country... When both James and Kyle get attracted to Miranda, she makes a decision.",5,THANK YOU!!!,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,730,"['Finally', 'Thing', 'Called', 'Love', 'getting', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'directors', 'cut', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'hope', 're-release', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'way', 'actors', 'sing', 'songs', 'better', 'singers', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'Anyway', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'here', 'scoop', 'imdb', 'Young', 'Miranda', 'Presley', 'aspiring', 'Country-singer/writer', 'Nashville', 'Tennessee', 'enter', 'weekly', 'singer', 'contest', 'held', 'Bluebird', 'Cafe', 'James', 'Wright', 'energetic', 'somewhat', 'chaotic', 'young', 'man', 'Kyle', 'Davidson', 'more', 'laid-back', 'kind', 'guy', 'Linda', 'Lue', 'Linden', 'who', 'career', 'may', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'Country', 'When', 'James', 'Kyle', 'get', 'attracted', 'Miranda', 'decision']",N/A

I'm so glad I did. On the strength of his performance alone - I would reccommend this movie. But there's so much more. The story is good...it keeps you interested. And the acting is really great...you feel like your there with them. It's a story about finding yourself...chasing your dreams...the people you meet along the way...and the thing called love. It has something for everyone in it...romance, coming of age, egos,and great music. Even if your not a country fan...i think you'll still like the songs. River gets to sing in this movie (something he loved to do) and that alone is worth seeing. I can't recommend this movie enough.

349303,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6302987865,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","The story is as old as the hills. Two men love one woman, like John Wayne and James Stewart in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, pilgrim. Only here in The Thing Called Love it's River Phoenix and Dermot Mulroney fighting over Samantha Mathis, and for comic relief, throw in some Sandra Bullock. Oh, yeah, all four have come to Nashville to make it in Country Music, where they meet at auditions for the Blue Bird Cafe. Not exactly the Ryman Auditorium, but a lot of Country Music stars got their start there.Director Peter Bogdanovich is best known for The Last Picture Show, which was one of his early films. Years later he was quoted as saying, ""Remember me? I used to be Peter Bogdanovich."" The Last Picture Show could have been called The Last Truly Great Picture Show from Peter Bogdanovich. In 1998 the National Film Preservation Board of the Library of Congress named The Last Picture Show to the National Film Registry, an honor awarded only to the most culturally significant films. He has had some spectacular failures and other modest success since then, but has done better as a film historian and writer than he has done as a director. One theory is that he doomed himself when he ditched his wife, set designer Polly Platt, for 19-year old model Cybill Shepherd, whom he met at The Last Picture Show. This theory credits Polly with being the controlling artistic consciousness of his best films, Paper Moon (1973) being the last one she worked on. He later starred Cybill in two of his biggest flops: Daisy Miller and At Long Last Love. A latter affair with 1980 Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratten ended in her being tragically killed by her jealous manager/husband, a story told in the Bob Fosse film Star 80.In spite of all this baggage, someone thought he would be great for The Thing Called Love. When he asked River Phoenix to do it, to his surprise, he wanted to do it. Maybe he was attracted to the musical aspect. It was not really a starring role, more of an ensemble piece with the main focus on the Miranda Presley character. Once River Phoenix was on board the project fell in place, and along with the other cast members, a lot of Country Music stars agreed to take part, in various cameos playing themselves.River Phoenix played a very talented but edgy songwriter. He was on the verge of success, but whenever he got too close he'd find a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. River, and the rest of the cast, either wrote or contributed to most all the songs used. One of the songs River wrote, Lone Star State of Mine, was very good, maybe a little too poetic and esoteric to actually be a hit song, but he showed promise. He grew up busking all over the US, and played in bands, and it showed. He was right at home on stage with a guitar. River Phoenix was kind of twitching and strange like his brother Joaquin on Letterman, but was he ever in character. When Bogdanovich met him, he thought he was this edgy guy, because he would really get into character and stay there like Andy Kaufman as Tony Clifton, but then after the film wrapped he found that he wasn't that guy at all. He was Huckleberry Finn, a real amiable and likeable guy. Makes you wonder what would have happened if he hadn't ODed. He could have been astronomical.Samantha Mathis was the lead, though she had to fight the course of a mighty river to stay there. Samantha played Miranda Presley, no relation. Presley was her middle name, given to her by a father who was a huge Elvis fan. Though Miranda was from New York City, Country music was in her blood. Samantha was so good in this movie. She sang country really well, and was always very authentic and believable. She did the singing, the song writing, and lest we forget, the acting. Of course the acting was the crux of the matter, but the singing and song writing also impressed me. Especially the singing.On the other hand, not so great at singing was Kyle Davidson (Dermot Mulroney). He was a Connecticut Yankee, and he didn't really fit in Nashville, but he tried harder. Mulroney is an accomplished cellist, and The Thing Called Loved allowed him to show off his cello chops. Though his character was not such a great singer, his character was a better writer, and when he has Miranda cut a demo of one of his songs, it sounds great. They concoct a crazy scheme to get Trisha Yearwood to hear it. It's so crazy it just might work. And work it does, when he hears it on the radio for the first time:[Kyle runs into back of a guy's car and a crowd gathers]Driver: Didn't you see the stop sign?Kyle Davidson: That's my song!Driver: Well, that's my car!Kyle Davidson: That's my song playing on the radio!Driver: You wrote that song?Kyle Davidson: Yeah!Bystander: You're a better songwriter than you are a driver.Kyle Davidson: That's my song!Bystander: That song's all right.Kyle Davidson: Kinda makes ya wanna pat your foot, doesn't it?Bystander: You shoulda patted the brake one time.Kyle Davidson: That's my song!Bystander: You got two hits in one day!Sandra Bullock has long been an undervalued commodity, who is finally getting a little respect. I hear she rules in her latest, The Blind Side, and was also quite an effective comedienne in The Proposal with Ryan Reynolds. She was sublime in this movie as the kind of person Blanche Dubois was talking about when she said she'd always depended on the kindness of strangers. She was always helping other people achieve their dreams, but neglecting her own. Of the four hopefuls, she would be voted least likely to succeed in Nashville, but she did succeed in creating a very warm though quirky character called Linda Lue Linden.The Thing Called Love cost 14 Million dollars, but it only made 1 million. It was the least financially successful film of 1993--a huge box office flop, but was it a bad movie?NO!!!!!!!!!!Bottom line is it was actually a very good movie about Nashville, songwriters, and it was River Phoenix's last role. I would have given it 5 stars, just to offset the bad box office and lack of acclaim, but let's be reasonable and give it 4 stars. But a very solid four stars. The title was kind of lackluster, and the marketing fell short, but if you would just watch the film, give it a chance, you'll love The Thing Called Love.The Proposal (Single Disc Widescreen)(2009)

349306,A31LHED3SKLWVB,6302987865,Darren,"[0, 0]","Peter Bogdonavich tries pretty unsuccessfully to document trying to Make It Big in Nashville in the early 90s.  I think it would've helped matters if the songs as written and especially as performed didn't sound more or less like much of the alt-rock scene during the time the movie was made.  For example, Samantha Mathis' final opus is a song called &#34;Maybe God's a Woman Too&#34;: I think we can all agree that such a sentiment would be greeted with stony silence in Nashville rather than with applause.  Fine for someone like Joan Osborne to sing &#34;What if God Was One of Us&#34; back in 95 (maybe Ms. Osborne saw this movie and got inspired), but she was played on college rock stations and didn't chart on the Country lists.It also would've helped if the three principles in the love-triangle -- Mathis, River Phoenix, and Dermot Mulroney -- were convincingly country, though to be fair to Mulroney, he at least looks and sounds like a country boy when he's not singing (at which time the accent is dropped and he sounds like yet another hipster at a cafe somewhere).  I don't think Bogdonavich really knew or even cared about his characters.  He has Mathis, supposedly an Elvis-obsessed wanna-be country singer from New Yawk Ciddy, wearing a Yankees ballcap while riding on the Americruiser from New York down to Nashville.  Of course, someone wanting to make it in Nashville would be aware that this could be a small but deadly faux pas.  But for Bogdonavich, it's just a convenient way to brand Mathis as the outsider and it also spares Mathis from having to worry about an accent.  There's even less excuse for Phoenix, who, when not mumbling the dialogue, sounds like a guy from wherever.  Speaking might be one thing -- there are thousands of wanna-be stars in that city from all over the world on any given day -- but you gotta sound country when you're singing a country song.  Phoenix just doesn't bother.  He also doesn't bother to put in a good performance as the maybe up-and-coming star.  As I said, he mostly mumbles his dialogue -- he's barely audible.  And on the whole, he's just too California Cool in his clothes, his haircut, and his approach.  Well, except when he suddenly demands that Mathis go and do his laundry for him. Phoenix is particularly bad in that scene; you can tell he doesn't believe his own character and he's just mouthing the words.  Ultimately, I think that Bogdonavich permitted too much improvisation among his young actors, who were too inexperienced to handle it.  The exception is Sandra Bullock, on the cusp of major stardom, here in a supporting role as the &#34;friend&#34;.  She's lights up this dreary picture whenever she appears, which is not near enough.All in all, I got the sense that this picture was a reboot of Bogdonavich's own &#34;Last Picture Show&#34; from 71, and that the busy Nashville setting and the distance of 20 years would prevent us from noticing the similarities.  Southern setting.  Two young guys, maybe going nowhere, maybe going somewhere, both in love with a cool gorgeous blonde.  The scrap between the guys over the girl.  Sound familiar?  Bogdonavich even managed to make Nashville seem like a small town.  The narrative centers around a few key settings: the local motel whose road-sign features daily-changing lyrics from country songs (I rather liked this), the greasy diner, the conveniently influential cafe where wanna-bes are given their first shot at stardom ... none of which is particularly reminiscent of the noisy and hype-driven city I've visited several times in my life.The poster for this movie (seen on Amazon's page as the main image for the movie) was slightly famous when I was young, and I can tell you that it was hung on a garage wall in a rock band I was in back in the day, but I had never gotten around to seeing the movie itself.  I knew it was about music, and had assumed it was about the the then-new grunge scene or something cool.  Instead it turns out to be Peter Bogdonavich recycling his own material.  Disappointing.  2 out of 5.  But thanks for that poster -- a key image of 90s dirty-cool.",2,I wanted to like it,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,4122,"['Peter', 'Bogdonavich', 'pretty', 'unsuccessfully', 'document', 'trying', 'Make', 'Big', 'Nashville', 'early', '90s', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'matters', 'songs', 'written', 'especially', 'performed', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'more', 'less', 'much', 'alt-rock', 'scene', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'example', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'final', 'opus', 'song', 'called', '34', 'Maybe', 'God', 'Woman', 'Too', '34', 'think', 'can', 'agree', 'sentiment', 'would', 'be', 'greeted', 'stony', 'silence', 'Nashville', 'rather', 'applause', 'Fine', 'someone', 'Joan', 'Osborne', 'sing', '34', 'What', 'God', 'Was', 'One', 'Us', '34', 'back', '95', 'maybe', 'Ms.', 'Osborne', 'saw', 'movie', 'got', 'inspired', 'was', 'played', 'college', 'rock', 'stations', 'did', ""n't"", 'chart', 'Country', 'lists.It', 'also', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'three', 'principles', 'love-triangle', 'Mathis', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'were', 'convincingly', 'country', 'be', 'fair', 'Mulroney', 'least', 'looks', 'country', 'boy', 'when', 'not', 'singing', 'time', 'accent', 'dropped', 'yet', 'hipster', 'cafe', 'somewhere', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Bogdonavich', 'really', 'knew', 'even', 'cared', 'characters', 'Mathis', 'supposedly', 'Elvis-obsessed', 'wanna-be', 'country', 'singer', 'New', 'Yawk', 'Ciddy', 'wearing', 'Yankees', 'ballcap', 'riding', 'Americruiser', 'New', 'York', 'down', 'Nashville', 'course', 'someone', 'wanting', 'make', 'Nashville', 'would', 'be', 'aware', 'could', 'be', 'small', 'deadly', 'faux', 'pas', 'Bogdonavich', 'just', 'convenient', 'way', 'brand', 'Mathis', 'outsider', 'also', 'Mathis', 'having', 'worry', 'accent', 'even', 'less', 'excuse', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'when', 'not', 'mumbling', 'dialogue', 'guy', 'wherever', 'Speaking', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'are', 'thousands', 'wanna-be', 'stars', 'city', 'world', 'given', 'day', 'got', 'ta', 'sound', 'country', 'when', ""'re"", 'singing', 'country', 'song', 'Phoenix', 'just', ""n't"", 'bother', 'also', ""n't"", 'bother', 'put', 'good', 'performance', 'maybe', 'up-and-coming', 'star', 'said', 'mostly', 'dialogue', 'barely', 'audible', 'whole', 'just', 'too', 'California', 'Cool', 'clothes', 'haircut', 'approach', 'Well', 'when', 'suddenly', 'Mathis', 'go', 'do', 'laundry', 'Phoenix', 'particularly', 'bad', 'scene', 'can', 'tell', ""n't"", 'believe', 'own', 'character', 'just', 'mouthing', 'words', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'Bogdonavich', 'permitted', 'too', 'much', 'improvisation', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'too', 'inexperienced', 'handle', 'exception', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'cusp', 'major', 'stardom', 'here', 'supporting', 'role', '34', 'friend', '34', 'lights', 'up', 'dreary', 'picture', 'whenever', 'not', 'enough.All', 'got', 'sense', 'picture', 'was', 'reboot', 'Bogdonavich', 'own', '34', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', '34', '71', 'busy', 'Nashville', 'setting', 'distance', '20', 'years', 'would', 'prevent', 'noticing', 'similarities', 'Southern', 'setting', 'Two', 'young', 'guys', 'maybe', 'going', 'nowhere', 'maybe', 'going', 'somewhere', 'love', 'cool', 'gorgeous', 'blonde', 'scrap', 'guys', 'girl', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Bogdonavich', 'even', 'managed', 'make', 'Nashville', 'seem', 'small', 'town', 'narrative', 'centers', 'few', 'key', 'settings', 'local', 'motel', 'road-sign', 'features', 'daily-changing', 'lyrics', 'country', 'songs', 'rather', 'liked', 'greasy', 'diner', 'conveniently', 'influential', 'cafe', 'where', 'wanna-bes', 'are', 'given', 'first', 'shot', 'stardom', 'none', 'particularly', 'reminiscent', 'noisy', 'hype-driven', 'city', ""'ve"", 'visited', 'several', 'times', 'life.The', 'poster', 'movie', 'seen', 'Amazon', 'page', 'main', 'image', 'movie', 'was', 'slightly', 'famous', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'hung', 'garage', 'wall', 'rock', 'band', 'was', 'back', 'day', 'had', 'never', 'gotten', 'seeing', 'movie', 'knew', 'was', 'music', 'had', 'assumed', 'was', 'then-new', 'grunge', 'scene', 'something', 'cool', 'Instead', 'out', 'be', 'Peter', 'Bogdonavich', 'recycling', 'own', 'material', 'Disappointing', '2', '5', 'thanks', 'poster', 'key', 'image', '90s', 'dirty-cool']",N/A

Now graduated from college I watched it again and found myself liking it for different reasons. Miranda Presley flees from New York to Nashville in hopes of becoming a country music star. She takes a job as a waitress at a famous little diner run by K.T.Oslin. In real life this is the same diner that 'discovered' lots of early country stars. She meets James, the cute but dark River Phoenix, and he has just signed a record deal. She becomes roommates with Sandra Bullock, an eager girl trying to make everybody else happy. And she also meets Kyle,played by Dermot Mulrouney, who has the hots for Miranda. They all want to become big stars, and so they audition over and over at the diner and this is where the movie takes place.There is some love chasing as well as dream chasing. Miranda is on a mission and she unexpectedly finds herself while chasing a dream. We get to see the struggles of an aspiring song writer and find humor when everything looks like it's lost. This version of the dvd is great with extra scenes added in, and anyone who has watched this before will know what they are. We also get to see the making of the movie with interviews on River Phoenix, which is reason alone to buy the dvd.Watching the film as an adult I found myself relating to everything. While I never wanted to be a star I do have dreams and watching these people chase them and fight for them made me try a little bit harder. All the actors became their character and made it that more real.

The movie clearly shows a common dream, a common disappointment, a common triumph, a common despair.  What really makes me wonder is the fact that the main hero, Samantha Mathis, never showed up in another movie, while Sandra Bullock, who in this movie is only a supporting actress, is who we know now. The best part of the movie is how she gets illuminated by the sign-board along the road, while she was moving away from her dream. Never give up girls! It's really amazing how a word, a simple little phrase, can influence your determination. It's the usual rollercoaster ride. But in this movie it's not an event, not a person changes the course, but words.  And another thing I really appreciate is the fact that her e it is clearly shown that it is of no shame to have heroes, or to be someone's greatest fan. It can serve us to built higher motivations.

The story revolves around Miranda Presley (Samantha Mathis), fresh from New York City; Connecticut cowboy Kyle (Dermot Mulroney); ditzy but genuine Southern belle Linda Lue (Sandra Bullock); and the bursting-with-creative-energy-and-confidence James Wright (River Phoenix).A few country stars have cameos, like Trisha Yearwood and Pam Tillis.The film isn't redneck-y at all; the people are genuine and likable, if sometimes annoying. The movie has a hip flair and is filled with newer country music (for 1993, that is). Aside from trying to make it in the music business the story naturally revolves around Kyle and James' attraction to Miranda and their ensuing rivalry. The cool thing is that the film never cops a meanspirited vibe, despite one brawl; the viewer gets the impression that these are good, talented people who will remain friends no matter what.What makes the film worthwhile is the magnetic performance of River Phoenix, who was 22 years-old during filming. His face looks almost exactly like Quorthon of Bathory, if you're familiar with that obscure metal band. River easily exudes the brooding charisma of Marlon Brando, no kidding. Unfortunately, three and a half months after the release of ""That Thing Called Love"" River was found dead outside an L.A. nightclub due to an overdose. He was 23.FINAL WORD: ""That Thing Called Love"" may not be a great country music film like ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" but it's pretty solid and highlighted by the brooding charisma of River Phoenix.
