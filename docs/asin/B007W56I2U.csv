It's hard to tell what's real and what's not for most of this movie. I'm a big fan of the old Twilight Zone show and this reminded me of that.",4,Disturbing,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,259,"['Wow', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'Any', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'up', 'alright', 'book', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'not', 'most', 'movie', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'old', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'show', 'reminded']",N/A

Hauser""","[2, 2]","This is a hard look inside the mind of a mentally ill person--rough to take and not much ""fun,"" but well-made and well-acted on a limited budget.  For a one-room, three actor ensemble piece, it's got plenty of action, although a lot of it's like chalk on a blackboard.  The screws tighten and so do the nerves.  It's never quite clear what's real and what isn't, and for the most part you want to just flee, but you can't, and you can't look away...like a bad accident in slow motion.

It was dark, and really sucks you in...I was really worried about what those two were going to do with that dead girl!  The suspense is great, and you get very attached to the characters.
