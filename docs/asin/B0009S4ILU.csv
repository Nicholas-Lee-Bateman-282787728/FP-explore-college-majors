First, what is immediate from the very first frame of film, is that Jane Fonda can really act.  She is a blackout level alcoholic who wakes up, finding a man in bed next to her who is stabbed through the heart and dead.  She spends a lot of time alone in his loft apartment acting her heart out in this aftermath and it was just wonderful to watch her.  She absolutely nails this has-been, alcoholic actress. Second, this is Jeff Bridges in his under appreciated stage of his career.  He is so natural, so easy, at once goofy yet edgy, that it is easy to think he is playing himself.  Thirdly, Sidney Lumet is one of our very best directors.  He rivets your attention from the very first frame and never lets go.  The late Raoul Julia also does a very good job as the soon to be ex husband to Fonda's character. The plot: did she murder this guy or has someone set her up to the take the fall for it?  She is the perfect patsy since she blacks out frequently from her extreme alcoholism.  I even managed to remember the who done it aspect on this film but it scarcely mattered.

912140,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0009S4ILU,C. O. DeRiemer,"[8, 9]","What makes The Morning After worth watching is Jane Fonda's performance and Sidney Lumet's direction. What makes the movie a bit irritating to watch is Alexandra Sternbergen (Fonda's character) and Sidney Lumet's direction. Alex (Fonda) is an over-the-hill actress and a drunk, who wakes up one morning with no memory of how she wound up in bed with the stranger next to her. The stranger is bloody and dead, with a knife sticking out of his chest. She runs, and winds up with an ex-cop, Turner Kendall (Jeff Bridges), who eventually thinks she's innocent. Also helping her is her husband, Jackie Manero (Raul Julia), a successful hair salon owner who serves the wealthy. Manero is competent, confidant and wants ""in"" after years of being an outsider. ""Being a hairdresser is what he does,"" Alex says to Kendall, ""not what he is."" Jackie and Alex have been friends for years, but married in name only for ten of them. The Morning After tells us of Alex's panic, of the realization that a killer is setting her up, and of the violent but not too surprising climax.Alex, as Viveca Van Loren, once had an acting career but it slipped away with booze and time. ""I saw you on Channel 13 with Richard Egan,"" a friendly bartender tells her. ""You sure were something, babe."" Now she's a brittle lush who has blackouts, although resourceful in a selfish kind of way. She knows she had a chance at stardom and can't get over not making it. She has moments of realism. ""They were grooming me to be the next Vera Miles,"" she says. ""I was going to replace someone the public didn't even know was missing."" Now she's an aging, needy, defensive drunk.The chemistry between Fonda and Bridges works well. Bridges plays Kendall as smart, open, drawn to Alex but cautious for his own reasons. He was a detective for 10 years in Bakersfield until he was stabbed by an under-age hooker. He resigned when he couldn't get his arm working well again. He's divorced with a daughter he sees occasionally. He's younger than Alex and probably just as worn around the edges as she. What do you do now, Alex asks, what keeps you busy? ""Oh, you know,"" he says, ""nothin', daily life."" He lives in a worn-out quonset hut and buys used books, often by the pound, which he plans to read some time.During the day and a half after they meet, Alex and Kendall get close to each other, but cautiously. They also learn who has set up Alex and why. The mystery may not be much, but there is a nice twist at the end. Lumet keeps things moving and gives the movie a nice look at Los Angeles. I wish, though, that he had worked with the screenwriter for a tighter, more forceful plot. The movie doesn't sag, exactly, but it gets a little distracted at times, especially when dealing with Alex Sternbergen.The movie is dependent on Jane Fonda's skills and appeal. She's a brave actress; Alex may be a thin, attractive woman, but she's also past any bloom of youth. With a hangover, smudged make-up and the wrinkles showing, Fonda isn't afraid to show the woman as she is. Fonda is such a strong actress, however, that after a bit I found myself losing a little sympathy for Alex. Self-pitying drunks are hard to like. Fonda (or Lumet) in my opinion doesn't leave room for much affection toward Alex until the end of the film. In fact, I found myself imagining Alex as being Bree Daniel 15 years after Klute. It made me warm up to her a little.On balance, I like the movie quite a bit, but I think it has weak spots. Still, it's an enjoyable film with good chemistry between Fonda and Bridges. The DVD picture, to me, looks a little soft but it's not objectionable.

912141,A3A03ETOTJRR0T,B0009S4ILU,DonnaReviews,"[4, 5]","""The Morning After"" (directed by Sidney Lumet) is not a great film, but it does contain great performances, particularly from Jane Fonda as Alex Sternbergen, an alcoholic ""never-was"" actress who wakes up in a strange man's bed after a drunken binge.  Even worse, the man has a knife in his back and she can't remember what happened.  Things get worse when the dead body keeps reappearing to terrorize her.The suspense is fairly well placed, if at times heavy-handed, the plot thickening when a sympathetic former cop, Turner Kendall (Jeff Bridges) comes onto the scene who may or may not be trustworthy. Fonda's scene with Bridges over an impromptu dinner is simply superb where she says, ""I used to be an actress,"" her biting sarcasm mixed with self-pitying pathos and bile.Like other reviewers, I believe the film is less a suspense film (although it aims for that) than the story of two wounded souls inexorably drawn together.  On that level, it works admirably and there are moments of genuine tension as well.  The unappetizing aspect is the cinematography and the unappealing apartments with Fonda keeping rank food and an unnecessary number of mayonnaise jars in her fridge.  Raul Julia appears as Fonda's hairdresser and ex-husband and Kathy Bates has a cameo as an artist living in the same building as the murdered man.",3,Fonda Powerful as Stone Drunk Waking Up to Murder,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,1330,"['Morning', 'directed', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'contain', 'great', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Alex', 'Sternbergen', 'alcoholic', 'never-was', 'actress', 'who', 'up', 'strange', 'man', 'bed', 'drunken', 'binge', 'Even', 'worse', 'man', 'knife', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'Things', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'dead', 'body', 'reappearing', 'terrorize', 'her.The', 'suspense', 'fairly', 'well', 'placed', 'times', 'heavy-handed', 'plot', 'thickening', 'when', 'sympathetic', 'former', 'cop', 'Turner', 'Kendall', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'scene', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'trustworthy', 'Fonda', 'scene', 'Bridges', 'impromptu', 'dinner', 'simply', 'superb', 'where', 'used', 'be', 'actress', 'biting', 'sarcasm', 'mixed', 'self-pitying', 'pathos', 'other', 'reviewers', 'believe', 'film', 'less', 'suspense', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'wounded', 'souls', 'inexorably', 'drawn', 'together', 'level', 'admirably', 'are', 'moments', 'genuine', 'tension', 'as', 'well', 'unappetizing', 'aspect', 'cinematography', 'unappealing', 'apartments', 'Fonda', 'keeping', 'rank', 'food', 'unnecessary', 'number', 'mayonnaise', 'jars', 'fridge', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'Fonda', 'hairdresser', 'ex-husband', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'cameo', 'artist', 'living', 'same', 'building', 'murdered', 'man']",N/A

So I promptly got on my trusty Internet and ordered it from Amazon.  I was very pleased to have it now in DVD format (I'd previously owned the VHS version, which I sold at a garage sale.  Alas!).I was not disappointed when my treat arrived.  I've always enjoyed watching both Jane Fonda and Jeff Bridges, and in this film, they are both ""wounded people.""  He is a former cop, with a tarnished past, who lives in something like those old Quonset huts we used to see a lot - back in the day! - And drives a very old, somewhat rusty car.Jane's character - Alex - is a fading, aging film star who can only be seen now on late-night TV.  Her apartment is in one of those old 1920s Hollywood buildings that are reminiscent of the Golden Age of filmdom.  Plus, she has a serious drinking problem.Which brings us to the opening scenes, in which Jane's character wakes up in an urban loft next to a man, whom she can't remember, and who is very much DEAD.  With a knife in his chest.She scrambles to erase evidence of her presence, and then tries to flee.  But she can't get a flight to SF, so in leaving her stalled car in the parking lot, she runs into Jeff Bridges' character.  Ah, providence.The rest of the movie follows the two rollicking and damaged characters as they try to piece together what happened to Jane's character while in a blackout - and solve the mystery.Oh, and did I mention the Raul Julia character?  One of Jane Fonda's character's ""exes,"" he is a charming and conniving stylist to the stars.

912150,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0009S4ILU,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 2]","Sidney Lumet directed this film.  I recalled it scaring me when I saw its theatrical release.  As a director, Lumet received four Oscar nominations for directing ""12 Angry Men"" in 1957, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" in 1975, ""Network"" in 1976 & ""The Verdict"" in 1982.  ""The Morning After"" is a mix of a character study of an almost famous actress, a crime thriller, a romance and a comedy.  At times the pacing falls.  However, for most of this film we are riveted by Jane Fonda's amazing performance, for which she was nominated for the Oscar.  In 1986, Marlee Matlin would take the statue home for ""Children of a Lesser God."" I purchased this DVD to study Fonda's performance with the college film acting class I teach.As Alex Sternbergen, we see one of Fonda's classic roles.  Jane has an incredible gift for seeming to go in three opposite directions at once.  Her emotional reactions are so dynamic, that she generates emotional electricity just by the sheer speed with which she zips from one reaction to another.  Her skill is so breathtakingly quick that she remains unique, a style unto herself.  In Fonda's Oscar-winning roles in ""Klute"" in 1971 and in ""Coming Home"" in 1978, we also see characters that are torn with conflict, both internal and external.  In the scene where Fonda becomes inebriated, the actress remains tightly controlled as the character Alex's inhibitions are thrown to the wind.  Jane Fonda is the reason to buy this DVD over two decades after its release.Jeff Bridges has also been Oscar-nominated for his excellent performances in ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot,"" ""Starman,"" & ""The Contender.""  As the shell-shocked ex-cop Turner Kendall, he likes to fix broken things, which probably explains his attraction to Alex.  One of the points of connection with this story is the ability Turner has to see value in things & people others throw away.  The multi-colored automobile he drives is a perfect metaphor for the film.Raul Julia, who won a Tony for his role in ""The Threepenny Opera"" and who would die of stomach cancer a few years after this film, turns in a good performance as Joaquin Manero, Alex's ex-husband, hairdresser.  The series of betrayals that occur near the end of the film happen with dizzying speed as Lumet bounces rapidly from one plateau to another.  It is also interesting to see future Oscar-winner Kathy Bates (Misery, 1990) in her fourth film play a small cameo as ""Woman on Mateo Street.""  Diane Salinger plays Isabel Harding, the wealthy socialite who woos Joaquin.  This is a good film with a stunning performance by Jane Fonda that should not be forgotten.

912154,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,B0009S4ILU,S. T. Peterson,"[1, 2]","Plot: Washed up, alcoholic, B local actress (Fonda) wakes up next to a man with a knife in his chest. She doesn't know how she got there. She wonders if she killed him. She runs into a nice sweet nave like down to earth cowboy (Bridges) who helps her out. The rest of the movie unfolds how the man died etc.Comments: Well as my title said I'm kinda conflicted. First off, this is a gritty kinda movie. Once again I would never want to know any of these characters. At first I would say that I would like to know bridges and maybe marry him as he is a good guy and good looking too. However, the fact that he ""courts"" and sleeps women like the Fonda character is kinda gross and makes him gross. Anyway, the setting is LA but it is the real LA that most of us know who have done more than visit a touristy spot . . . well even in route to the touristy spots you see these places. It looks hot and dry. The people are seedy. The dead guy is even a pornographer. The ""rich"" people in the movie are gay like hair dressers. There is a drag queen. Fonda's character is a pathological liar. A drunk who blacks out often with strangers coming and going. It is a wonder she is not dead. When you learn more about her past in the movie you find out she even slashed her first husband with a knife. She goes into childish rages for some reason when people call her a ""lush"". Bridges character lives in a warehouse and fixes toasters he finds in a dumpster. Just not people I care to watch.On the other hand, the world is occupied in some spots with people who behave just like this and live in gross places like LA. And LA does look like this movie. Soooooo my point is if you can manage to pull back and look at this as ""art"" then Fonda is a good job as she usually does and Bridges too. The plot is one of those 80s thrillers where the ""thriller"" music blurts out when a cat jumps in the scene etc. It is one of those movies in other words that you can only see once maybe twice and then forget about.Final notes: I am so glad that that cat was let out of the closet. I found myself disturbed it was locked in a closet with no one to care for it. You get to see a young Kathy Bates in a bit part. You get to see the handsome guy from Topgun and Roxanne in a bit part. Mostly you get to see Americans beautiful, young and slim like they used to be. Best line is ""I'm not one of them. They are all full of malice and hate. I just observe."" Too honest for today's world. I love how (only in the movies) Fonda's character can walk down the street in full daylight and around the corner and appear in an apartment that show it night outside as she pulls down the shades only to heighten the suspense. LOL Funny. And without giving too much away Bridges character gets hit over the head with a ceramic pot that is so thin it shatters into a million pieces but he has so much blood pouring down his face he can't see to shoot a gun and eventually winds up motionless in a hospital bed. LOL Heelarious.

Well sort of.  Barbarella can not be beat when you are after some weird over the top fun.  Few movies can match Barbarella in its over the top goofyness.  China Syndrome was well acted and pretty good all around.  The Morning After has a ""Funky 70's"" burn out sort of feel to it.  I like Morning after because I started out hating both characters and ended up so happy they both got together.I like in this movie the sappy icky sweet ending one other reviewer seems to dislike.  I like a movie that ends happily so you can imaging the two characters you have spent an hour investing in leave you with a hollywood happy ending pay off.  The movies I hate are those that build the viewer up to hoping two partners or partner and side kick start building a life together.  I hate the so called sophisticated endings more common in the newer generation of movies where the credits start rolling and the silly movie seems to have no resolution.  Whats worse is many movies in so stupidly now its makes all the time you spend watching seem wasted.This movie has a predictable ending but thats what makes it awesome to me.  This movie was done right.

Wilkinson,"[3, 8]","This movie was released in 1986 with little fanfare, though it was directed by Sidney Lumet and starred former superstar Jane Fonda; it was simply a failure.  Yet somehow Jane managed to receive her umpteenth Best Actress Academy Award nomination, the fluke to end all flukes.The movie itself isn't very difficult to watch, though at times it's extremely hokey and tongue-in-cheek.  Admittedly, however, it does have its exciting, interesting moments.Jane's Best Actress nomination was enough for me to pre-order the DVD (having already seen the movie on VHS format).  If you look at the four other women that were nominated with Jane in 1986, you'll find that it was another one of those ""slow"" years, and Jane MAY have received her nomination simply because there was no one else to nominate.  This isn't Jane's or any woman's fault; in the 1980s there was an astonishing lack of strong, meaty roles for women in movies.  For the most part this situation still exists today, though in the 2000s it has bettered dramatically; just see ""Monster,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" and ""Being Julia"" to see what I mean.""The Morning After"" is not a ""hit"" movie, and its DVD release will not set rooms on fire with astounding sales figures.  And it's most likely only being released because of Jane's recent success with ""Monster-in-Law.""  But as a movie fan, it might be important to continue to support the on-going cause for better roles for women.
