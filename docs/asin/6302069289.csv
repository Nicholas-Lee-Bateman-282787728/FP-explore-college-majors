294110,A1CYOHNGQ1WED1,6302069289,Christopher Hivner,"[1, 1]","Zigra, a shark-like creature from another planet, comes to conquer Earth. It causes monstrous earthquakes to prove its power and then demands the people of earth to surrender to him. We fight back of course but are no match for Zigra's goofy powers. With the help of a couple of marine biologists, Gamera saves the day in the end, winning yet another monster steel cage match. As with all Gamera movies there are two annoying children, dumb adults and poor special effects. The story is ok but plays out kind of boring. The original Gamera was a pretty good monster movie but as the series went on they just got goofier and goofier. Most memorable scene? Two grown men arguing over who's going to buy the last fish at a seafood market. It goes on and on and has nothing to do with the rest of the film.

294111,A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I,6302069289,"GameraRocks ""captpicardfan""","[2, 2]","This movie would appeal to kids and die hard Gamera fans. I for one liked the movie but some parts were boring. The highlight of the movie was when Gamera played his theme on Zigra's back using a giant rock, and then he starts to dance. That was funny. But for those who think the movies earlier in the series are bad, avoid this at all cost, because if you're not a kid 10 years old or younger and aren't a die hard Gamera fan, it's highly doubtful that you will like the movies. But being a Gamera fan, I enjoyed this movie. Not the best, but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was the worst in the Showa series.Zigra himself was a very interesting monster. A shark kaiju is a really cool idea and it is pulled off very well. It is always interesting when Zigra makes the scene and shows up in the movie. He is probably my favorite Showa Gamera baddy after Gyaos. A very interesting monster indeed.Gamera looked pretty cool in the film except he was given green blood in this film when in earlier entries in this series he had blue. I guess that's the reason he has green blood in the Heisei series.The children were at their annoying best! No, not really, I actually thought the kids on Gamera vs. Guiron were more annoying. The kids didn't really bother me at all, mainly because they weren't the heroes of the movie like the children were in the other Gamera movies before this. It was the scientists and adults who figured out how to defeat Zigra.From the start of the movie, you could tell that the special fx were cheap. The rocket ship and everything at the beginning of the movie looked like miniature toys. But it didn't hurt the story really at all. The rest of the film was good.Overall, I recommend this to diehard Gamera fans only. This is definitely not a movie to watch if you have never seen a Gamera movie before, it's not impressive enough to win any fans, but it's cute enough to keep fans entertained.This movie has leasons to teach; don't pollute the oceans, what the word magnitude means, and if we behave and study hard maybe one day we'll be as smart as the dolphins (you'll understand the joke if you watch the movie).Another interesting thing about the movie was Gamera's theme song itself. You could actually hear the children sing the words to the song in this movie. I haven't seen the other ones in a while and I don't remember the lyrics being heard in the theme before this movie, especially in the American version. I don't understand Japanese, but the theme is a bunch of singing about Gamera. I know this because in the song they say ""Gamera"", I can understand that much. Lol.For the last time, if you're not a Gamera fan and you can't tolerate childish morals and plots (after all, this movie was intended for kids so it does seem kidish), I don't really recommend this movie unless you want to collect as many Gamera movies as possible. Not saying the movie is bad, just not something many of adults would appreciate, especially when it's compared to the early Godzilla movies.My Rating For This Movie is: 3 StarsAn average person that isn't a Gamera fan would probably give this a D+ at best. A non-kaiju fan would give this movie an F for sure. Make your own judgments, but if you watch it and don't like it, I warned you.",3,For Gamera Fans Only,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,3267,"['movie', 'would', 'appeal', 'kids', 'die', 'hard', 'Gamera', 'fans', 'one', 'liked', 'movie', 'parts', 'were', 'boring', 'highlight', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Gamera', 'played', 'theme', 'Zigra', 'back', 'using', 'giant', 'rock', 'then', 'dance', 'was', 'funny', 'who', 'think', 'movies', 'earlier', 'series', 'are', 'bad', 'avoid', 'cost', ""'re"", 'not', 'kid', '10', 'years', 'old', 'younger', 'are', ""n't"", 'die', 'hard', 'Gamera', 'fan', 'highly', 'doubtful', 'will', 'like', 'movies', 'being', 'Gamera', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Not', 'best', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'was', 'worst', 'Showa', 'series.Zigra', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'monster', 'shark', 'kaiju', 'really', 'cool', 'idea', 'pulled', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'always', 'interesting', 'when', 'Zigra', 'scene', 'up', 'movie', 'probably', 'favorite', 'Showa', 'Gamera', 'baddy', 'Gyaos', 'very', 'interesting', 'monster', 'indeed.Gamera', 'looked', 'pretty', 'cool', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'green', 'blood', 'film', 'when', 'earlier', 'entries', 'series', 'had', 'blue', 'guess', 'reason', 'green', 'blood', 'Heisei', 'series.The', 'children', 'were', 'annoying', 'best', 'No', 'not', 'really', 'actually', 'thought', 'kids', 'Gamera', 'vs.', 'Guiron', 'were', 'more', 'annoying', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'mainly', 'were', ""n't"", 'heroes', 'movie', 'children', 'were', 'other', 'Gamera', 'movies', 'was', 'scientists', 'adults', 'who', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'defeat', 'Zigra.From', 'start', 'movie', 'could', 'tell', 'special', 'fx', 'were', 'cheap', 'rocket', 'ship', 'everything', 'beginning', 'movie', 'looked', 'miniature', 'toys', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'story', 'really', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'good.Overall', 'recommend', 'diehard', 'Gamera', 'fans', 'only', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'watch', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Gamera', 'movie', 'not', 'impressive', 'enough', 'win', 'fans', 'cute', 'enough', 'keep', 'fans', 'entertained.This', 'movie', 'leasons', 'teach', 'do', ""n't"", 'pollute', 'oceans', 'what', 'word', 'magnitude', 'means', 'behave', 'study', 'hard', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'be', 'as', 'smart', 'dolphins', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'joke', 'watch', 'movie', '.Another', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'Gamera', 'theme', 'song', 'could', 'actually', 'hear', 'children', 'sing', 'words', 'song', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'ones', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'lyrics', 'being', 'heard', 'theme', 'movie', 'especially', 'American', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Japanese', 'theme', 'bunch', 'singing', 'Gamera', 'know', 'song', 'say', 'Gamera', 'can', 'understand', 'much', 'Lol.For', 'last', 'time', ""'re"", 'not', 'Gamera', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tolerate', 'childish', 'morals', 'plots', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'kids', 'seem', 'kidish', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'movie', 'want', 'collect', 'many', 'Gamera', 'movies', 'possible', 'Not', 'saying', 'movie', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'something', 'many', 'adults', 'would', 'appreciate', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'early', 'Godzilla', 'movies.My', 'Rating', 'Movie', '3', 'StarsAn', 'average', 'person', ""n't"", 'Gamera', 'fan', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'D+', 'best', 'non-kaiju', 'fan', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'F', 'sure', 'Make', 'own', 'judgments', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'warned']",N/A

Bernabo,"[1, 1]","&quot;Gamera vs. Zigra&quot; (&quot;Gamera tai Shinkai kaij Jigura&quot;) is the final original adventure of the jet-powered superturtle monster that was Daiei Studio's attempt to capitalize on the Godzilla craze. It was the last film in the original series because it is just a bad, bad, movie. If you watch this movie expecting to see Gamera just because his name is in the title, then you are going to be woefully disappointed. Actors with cameos in films have more screen time than Gamera in this turkey. Actually, I think we hear the &quot;Gamera March&quot; more than we see Gamera. Once again aliens show up, destroying a moon base, killing off dolphins, and kidnapping a couple of those annoying kids (Kenny and Helen this go round) who always show up in these films. Zigra starts causing earthquakes and when the boys escape the Zigra women chase them through Sea World (?) and send people into comas just by looking at them [insert an appropriate jokes about wanting the Zigra women to put you into a coma to save you from watching this movie]. When Gamera finally makes his appearance Zigra becomes a sort of giant shark monster thingie. This film is also known as &quot;Gamera vs. the Deep Sea Monster Zigra,&quot; which short of explain Zigra's shark look (this was still a few years before &quot;Jaws,&quot; so do not assume some sort of Spielberg homage by writer Nisan Takahashi or director Noriaki Yuasa.

Anyone who enjoys seeing how bad special effects can look should enjoy this.The framing is not always as good as some of the other Gamera movies, but it does have some good moments. All of that gets lost in the pan-scan editions that normally end up on TV and tapes - especially with the aspect ratio of these movies - 2.35:1. That's a large chunk of the image being chopped off to fill the screen.Fortunately, we have one company releasing these movies the way fans want to see them. This tape is letterboxed so we can view this movie in all of its low-budget glory, and it's subtitled so we don't have to put up with the bad voice actors.This is definitely a true B-movie. You have a shark-like alien using mind-control on people to help him conquer the Earth so that his species can become the dominant life form. Within the storyline, there are also attempts to warn people about the dangers of pollution. Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster (aka Godzilla vs. Hedorah) attempted the same thing around this time.His primary human agent is an attractive woman who starts off in an alien uniform that looks like it was from Gamera Vs. Guillon - minus the helmets. It has the same silver, padded torso piece with green fabric on the legs and arms. It was modified some for this movie.In this case, bankruptcy was a good thing for Daiei. It forced them to look at things in a new way when they went back in business to make the newer Gamera movies.
