Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","In the vein ofLittle Miss Sunshinein which we have a few high-caliber actors playing roles in a small budget film, KING OF CALIFORNIA is funny and quirky enough to make for an evening of enjoyable film watching. Although I'd give higher praise to Little Miss Sunshine, King of California deserves its own rays.Michael Douglas got top billing, but it is really Evan Rachel Wood (Down in the Valley) who's the star. We begin and end the film with her, and it is her performance as the teenage Miranda that strikes the strongest chord. Don't get me wrong, I'm not taking anything away from Douglas' manic performance; he did it very well, and it was nice to see him in a not-so-serious role. But Wood pulls off an incredibly strong spot alongside Douglas, and she did it effortlessly.We have, however, seen this type of set-up before: reversing the roles of responsible adult to that of the child while the irresponsible one is the parent. It's an old Hollywood plot but one that can be used to great advantage if done right. And relative unknown writer/director Mike Cahill (best known for his visual effects work on the CRITTERCAM TV series) does a fine job in giving us a story of touching simplicity and wacky humor.The story starts out with Miranda (Wood) picking up her father Charlie (Douglas) at a mental hospital during his release. Having lived alone for quite some time, Miranda is a self-motivated woman, keeping up the family home on her own. Her mother (Charlie's ex) also ran away from home during one of Charlie's early mental meltdowns and left Miranda to fend for herself.Hoping her father might be getting better, any possibility of normalcy is swept aside when Charlie immediately starts searching for a lost 17th century treasure supposedly buried in their now booming community of Santa Clarita, California. Grudgingly being dragged along during late night excursions (to check star alignments) and heat-of-the-day golf course spots, Miranda slowly comes to accept that this might be a good way to bond with her delusional father. But then the discovery that the lost treasure is hidden beneath the concrete foundation of a newly installed Costco seems to put a halt to their plans; but Charlie has no intentions of letting anything get in his way.Miranda must come to grips with her father's need to connect with something in his life; something that makes his life have meaning. It is Charlie's (and Miranda's) slow realization that this meaning is each other, and this gives the film all of its successful, emotional heft.Whether or not Charlie found the treasure and gave it to Miranda is irrelevant (as we never see the treasure ...even though it is heavily alluded to). Perhaps the gold wasn't there, perhaps it was. Or maybe -- just maybe -- the gold resides elsewhere, meaning that a connection between father and daughter matters more than any metal.",4,What Matters More: Gold ...Or Human Connection?,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,2878,"['vein', 'ofLittle', 'Miss', 'Sunshinein', 'have', 'few', 'high-caliber', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'small', 'budget', 'film', 'KING', 'OF', 'CALIFORNIA', 'funny', 'quirky', 'enough', 'make', 'evening', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'watching', ""'d"", 'give', 'higher', 'praise', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'King', 'California', 'own', 'rays.Michael', 'Douglas', 'got', 'top', 'billing', 'really', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Down', 'Valley', 'who', 'star', 'begin', 'end', 'film', 'performance', 'teenage', 'Miranda', 'strongest', 'chord', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'taking', 'anything', 'away', 'Douglas', 'manic', 'performance', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'not-so-serious', 'role', 'Wood', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'spot', 'Douglas', 'did', 'effortlessly.We', 'have', 'however', 'seen', 'type', 'set-up', 'reversing', 'roles', 'responsible', 'adult', 'child', 'irresponsible', 'one', 'parent', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'plot', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'great', 'advantage', 'done', 'right', 'relative', 'unknown', 'writer/director', 'Mike', 'Cahill', 'best', 'known', 'visual', 'effects', 'work', 'CRITTERCAM', 'TV', 'series', 'fine', 'job', 'giving', 'story', 'touching', 'simplicity', 'wacky', 'humor.The', 'story', 'out', 'Miranda', 'Wood', 'picking', 'up', 'father', 'Charlie', 'Douglas', 'mental', 'hospital', 'release', 'Having', 'lived', 'alone', 'quite', 'time', 'Miranda', 'self-motivated', 'woman', 'keeping', 'up', 'family', 'home', 'own', 'mother', 'Charlie', 'ex', 'also', 'ran', 'away', 'home', 'one', 'Charlie', 'early', 'mental', 'meltdowns', 'left', 'Miranda', 'fend', 'herself.Hoping', 'father', 'might', 'be', 'getting', 'better', 'possibility', 'normalcy', 'swept', 'aside', 'when', 'Charlie', 'immediately', 'searching', 'lost', '17th', 'century', 'treasure', 'supposedly', 'buried', 'now', 'booming', 'community', 'Santa', 'Clarita', 'California', 'Grudgingly', 'being', 'dragged', 'late', 'night', 'excursions', 'check', 'star', 'alignments', 'heat-of-the-day', 'golf', 'course', 'spots', 'Miranda', 'slowly', 'accept', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'way', 'bond', 'delusional', 'father', 'then', 'discovery', 'lost', 'treasure', 'hidden', 'concrete', 'foundation', 'newly', 'installed', 'Costco', 'put', 'halt', 'plans', 'Charlie', 'intentions', 'letting', 'anything', 'get', 'way.Miranda', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'father', 'need', 'connect', 'something', 'life', 'something', 'life', 'have', 'meaning', 'Charlie', 'Miranda', 'slow', 'realization', 'meaning', 'other', 'film', 'successful', 'emotional', 'heft.Whether', 'not', 'Charlie', 'found', 'treasure', 'gave', 'Miranda', 'irrelevant', 'never', 'see', 'treasure', 'even', 'heavily', 'alluded', 'Perhaps', 'gold', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'perhaps', 'was', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'gold', 'resides', 'elsewhere', 'meaning', 'connection', 'father', 'daughter', 'matters', 'more', 'metal']",King of California

I also liked the McDonald's shift manager looking over Miranda's shoulder to make sure she assembled a quarter cheese correctly--this actually happened to me when I was sixteen, working in a Southern California franchise. Some things never change. Miranda and her father stand in for everyone who tries but fails to live in peace with the standardization and industrialization going on all around them.They also have whatever it takes to ""follow your bliss"" and try to find some sense of meaning in an increasingly orderly and planned and therefore quite insane urbanized landscape literally covering over the once-verdant earth walked by the so-called savages who appreciated and tended it.Incidentally, although shot as a romp about a parentified daughter trying to give her bipolar father a sense of purpose, the film bears out what I've written about inDeep California: Images and Ironies of Cross and Sword on El Camino Realand inTerrapsychology: Reengaging The Soul Of Place: what happens to traumatize a colonized and paved-over place never goes away until we find some way to heal the recurring themes by understanding them and reshaping them from within them. Costco and McDonald's are but commercialized and updated missions to convert the locals to a globalized existence that eats their souls and landscapes. The counter-mission resides in the loving heart pursuing its dreams or helping others to, as well-named Miranda does in this Californian tempest.p.s. For those of you with some knowledge of California history: yes, you're right: no Spanish expeditions during the 1620s. After Cabrillo had been by, landing his ships but making no tours through California, Vizcaino did another sail-by in 1602. After that, no known Spanish incursions came through the state until 1769, when Junipero Serra and his merry band came colonizing. ""Santa Clarita"" got its name from the river they named ""Santa Clara"" as they marched through. Incidentally, Miranda's mission history lesson was correct, and not only for the Chumash of the Central Coast: most of the Indians who entered the missions never came out again.p.p.s. The part about how California got its name is true. The bestseller Miranda refers to was called THE EXPLOITS OF ESPLANDIAN. The author's name was Montalvo.

1108719,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000WCN8PA,Cubist,"[12, 15]","Hoping to replicate the overwhelming positive critical response he received for his performance inWonder Boys, Michael Douglas plays another quirky outsider in King of California. Despite being produced by Alexander Payne (Sideways (Widescreen Edition)), the film enjoyed a brief theatrical run and finally makes its debut on DVD.Michael Douglas is excellent as the wildly eccentric Charlie. There is a mischievous glint in his eyes when he feels like he is getting closer to the treasure. The older Douglas gets and the more films he does, the more comfortable an actor he becomes. He delivers a nuanced performance that never veers off into showy scenery-chewing territory. With his mountain man beard, Douglas certainly looks the part of an ex-mental patient and, at times, seems to be channeling Jeff Bridges inThe Big Lebowski (Widescreen Collector's Edition).Evan Rachel Wood plays Charlie's extremely patient daughter and narrator of this unusual tale and so, naturally, our sympathies lie with her because she's, y'know, the sane voice of reason. Miranda is the responsible one to Charlie's childish antics. Wood is the ideal foil to Douglas, the straight man to his kooky eccentric.King of California belongs to Douglas and the film sinks of swims based on how well he sells his character's mad quest - kind of like Robin Williams' traumatized bum inThe Fisher King. And while Mike Cahill is no Terry Gilliam, Douglas is more than up for taking on this wild ride with the charisma to draw us in, much like Charlie convinces Miranda to follow him.There is an audio commentary by writer/director Mike Cahill, cinematographer Jim Whitaker, production designer Dan Bishop and first assistant director Richard L. Fox. Cahill talks about how a lack of money forced him to rewrite the opening scene and improve on it. Everyone takes turns pointing out the various locations used in the film which is as boring as it sounds. They also point out dry technical details like the wonders of colour timing. It's amazing that this commentary can be so dull with all of these skilled artists at hand but unfortunately this is the case.""The Making of The King of California"" your standard electronic press kit with soundbites from the cast and crew mixed with clips from the film. Douglas claims that this was one of the best scripts he has ever read and compares his character to Don Quixote.

His 17 year-old daughter Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood) has somehow managed to get on with life on her own through some beurocratic foster home snafu, and has adjusted to eking out a simple life without her parents.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE KING OF CALIFORNIA (2007) is, I suspect, another near-Disney experience intended to boost the career of the darling and talented Evan Rachel Wood. Before she did THE LIFE BEFORE HER EYES, she starred alongside Michael Douglas (bless him, just recovering from throat cancer at age 66) in KING.To be brief, a teen (Wood) receives her father (Douglas) back home after a 2-year mental hospital stint. It has to be said that Douglas has lost none of his charm or his riveting half-loony-bird abilities. I remember him in THE STAR CHAMBER as a very young man - he was as riveting back then. Here he convinces his daughter, with good proof, that he knows the location of some large Spanish treasure.Traipsing wildly around California, they find the landmarks and areas precisely where they ought to be (in large part thanks to Douglas' hand-held and symbolic Magellan GPS, and he also yanks out an awesome metal detector named ""Excalibur"").There are such hints, very small, about finding the New World. Wood's narration from an old (mythical) Spanish account of the New World parallels their adventures magnificently. (Inside a Costco store, she narrates from the book, ""we saw the caves covered with the natives' childish drawings"".)The ending I did not like, but this is an excellent family film and quite a lot of fun to watch in any case. The incredibly funny and endearingly droopy-faced Willis Burks II plays Pepper, the reliable sidekick, funny as all get-out - and the actual adventure, though on the unbelievable side, is a lot of fun to follow.2006's dreadful TILLAMOOK'S GOLD (vid. my review) is much like this. My suspicion is someone got wind of this project, stole its basic premise, then quickly shot and released TILLAMOOK. One hopes not, but it looks that way to me and is very common. However, TILLAMOOK is a 300% throwaway film, whereas KING OF CALIFORNIA is not, in my opinion.Throwaway or not, this film ranks pretty highly among my ""fun"" picks good for any occasion.

It also gives 20-year old Evan Rachel Wood the opportunity to compete with a Pro and come out an equal - quite a feat for such a young actress.  Written and directed by Mike Cahill the story does have appeal, especially since it is set in Santa Clarita, California, a rapidly developing 'hinterland' that is suffering from the effects of too rapid industrialization, changing from a picturesque remnant of California raw beauty into yet another perky little town.Charlie (Michael Douglas) has been in and out of mental institutions for his wacky behavior.  His life as a jazz bassist and entrepreneur has always veered off the map, leaving him alone with his only daughter Miranda who has survived her father's irresponsible life by keeping the old family home (in the midst of a huge housing development) with the money she makes double shifting  at the local MacDonalds.  When Charlie is released his focus is on discovering the gold left behind by Catholic priests in the mid 1600s, a fact he has researched while hospitalized, on the Internet, and from the journal of one of the priests. Miranda slowly buys into Charlie's madcap scheme and adventure as a gold hunter and the caper results in a bonding between father and daughter that has been teetering on the brink of disaster for years.  The manner in which Charlie, Miranda, and an old ex-con friend  Pepper (Willis Burks II) go after the treasure provides most of the energy of the film.Yes, there are bits and pieces of this project that have been done many times before (and often better), but the pleasure of KING OF CALIFORNIA lies in the bravura and touching performances by Douglas and Wood.

As Charlie pursues his quest for the treasure of a long-dead Spanish missionary, we learn for the umpteenth time from Hollywood that convenience food and big box stores have polluted the land (but Hollywood gladly accepts their product placement fees), that the people who work in them are unpleasant or lecherous and look bad in bathing suits, that police are fat and/or dimwitted (except for the hot babe who picks up on Charlie's clever stratagem of leaving his telephone number in the hood of her cruiser), and that subdivisions existing where orange groves used to be is bad.  Unfortunately, after the viewer has taken the necessary thirty seconds to ingest those insights, Charlie, in full, wild beard of course, still has many minutes to lumber along the screen to his destiny in the awful society that doesn't appreciate him.Instead of King, pay another visit to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which - in case any viewer on the planet overlooked the obvious link to that classic - the movie kindly drives it home by having Wood reading Sometimes a Great Notion in one scene.",2,Let's See - Three Good Things to Say...,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,1680,"['Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'large', 'part', 'soundtrack', 'especially', 'Billy', 'Bragg/Wilco', 'version', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'California', 'Stars', 'first', 'part', 'credits', 'over', 'mercifully', 'short', '1:33.Beyond', 'King', 'California', 'nothing', 'recommend', 'least', 'original', 'thought', 'entire', 'running', 'time', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'real', 'life', 'pillar', 'Hollywood', 'Establishment', 'fiction', 'play', 'Charlie', 'misunderstood', 'bipolar', 'irresponsible', 'outsider', 'visionary', 'bland', 'SoCal', 'America', 'Think', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'role', 'reprised', 'questionable', 'sanity', 'twist', 'Charlie', 'quest', 'treasure', 'long-dead', 'Spanish', 'missionary', 'learn', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'convenience', 'food', 'big', 'box', 'stores', 'have', 'polluted', 'land', 'Hollywood', 'gladly', 'product', 'placement', 'fees', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'lecherous', 'look', 'bad', 'bathing', 'suits', 'police', 'are', 'fat', 'and/or', 'dimwitted', 'hot', 'babe', 'who', 'up', 'Charlie', 'clever', 'stratagem', 'leaving', 'telephone', 'number', 'hood', 'cruiser', 'subdivisions', 'existing', 'where', 'orange', 'groves', 'used', 'be', 'bad', 'Unfortunately', 'viewer', 'taken', 'necessary', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'ingest', 'insights', 'Charlie', 'full', 'wild', 'beard', 'course', 'still', 'many', 'minutes', 'lumber', 'screen', 'destiny', 'awful', 'society', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'him.Instead', 'King', 'pay', 'visit', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'case', 'viewer', 'planet', 'overlooked', 'obvious', 'link', 'classic', 'movie', 'kindly', 'home', 'having', 'Wood', 'reading', 'Sometimes', 'Great', 'Notion', 'one', 'scene']",King of California

During his incarceration, he had become fixated with the idea of finding a stash of old gold coins that had been hidden for hundreds of years.  He is gradually able to lure his teenage daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) into his quixotic quest for the treasure.After very careful calculations, Douglas determines that the gold coins lie buried beneath the cement floor of a Costco.  He and his daughter hatch an improbable plan to retrieve the treasure.  We watch the two of them execute the plan and we don't really believe any of it for a moment, but it is entertaining to see it unfold.This movie has a very uneven tone.  Some scenes are pretty funny and some scenes are rather grim and it doesn't all come together quite as well as it could have.  But there's never really a dull moment.  The acting is close to perfect.  The location filming adds a welcome verisimilitude.  It's a very pleasant movie to sit through.Fans of Michael Douglas won't want to miss this one.

1108740,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B000WCN8PA,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Wonderful indie gem that flew way under the radar when released.Tells the story of Miranda and Charlie.Miranda is a sturdy, grounded, hard working teenager. Forced to give up high school in order to make ends meet - life now consists of her fast food job and maintaing the family home. Growing up quickly when her parents split up, that process sped up considerably when her father began showing signs of mental illness, culminating in a terrifying suicide attempt in which she saved his life.She's pretty much been on her own since entering her teens.Her dad is Charlie. And Charlie is bipolar. A condition that gets complicated when adding weed and/or alcohol into the mix. However, other than making him more distracted than usual, he's mostly harmless. Making his way through life as a part-time jazz musician and who knows what else - Miranda only sees him intermittently; sometimes a long time will pass before getting ""the phone call"".Despite their fractured relationship - it's clear they love one another very much. Each is the only other family they have.One day, five months prior to the present, the call is made. A request to retrieve him from yet another extended stay at a state hospital. It's the first time she's seen him in two years.The last time was when she was 15.After a bumpy reunion, as each has to get used to one another's presence, Charlie informs her that he has a new goal in life. He's embarking on his last great adventure - uncovering a Spanish treasure lost for more than three centuries.And he wants her to come along.It's clear he's still unstable; his release premature. Miranda can only hope he doesn't get into too much trouble. But as he begins to show signs that his condition is worsening, she becomes deeply torn about what to do. Her life, while far from ideal, was at least manageable. With her dad in the picture, it's quickly spiraling toward the toilet. And she's not willing to give up everything she's achieved just to facilitate his gentle madness.But Charlie, in his own frantic, bumbling, barely coherent attempts to explain his reasoning - actually gets Miranda to listen. Really listen.And now she's beginning to wonder if she's crazy too.The overuse of flashbacks and some awkward editing aside, 'King' is an engaging, funny, and poignant film.Personal Note:- This is likely my all-time favorite performance by Michael Douglas. Mind you, I had to contend with and balance that judgment against Oscar-winning creepGordon Gekko, hilarious adventurerJack T. Colton, and emotional crippleNicholas Van Orton.Internally debated making a statement like that for a performer whose incredible career is both notable and lengthy. But I'm comfortable with it now. Barring some kind of unexpected twilight performance - this will always be tops in my book when considering Michael Douglas, the actor.In his role as Charlie, he delivered a pinnacled and nuanced form of the craft: Sensitive, insightful, suffering, angered, passionate, melancholy, introspective (a tough one to project on film), regret, humor, madness, and love. A genuine testament to the work of a master thespian.",4,"""Naked Chinese Men Swimming To California.

I have seen her in ""Thirteen"", ""Pretty Persuasion"", and now ""King of California"". Her performances in all three films are well beyond girls of her age. Michael Douglas is in the same form that made ""Romancing the Stone"" such a hit. He does not disappoint here, either.What do you do, when you are a girl who has had to work two jobs, fit only for girls of that tender age of sixteen, just to pay the bills left behind by a) A mother who is an anal ""hand-model"" that deserts her family because b) Your father is a mental case just released from a sanitarium, and will now live with you? Well, that question is answered in this somewhat dark comedy. The histories of both Charlie (Michael Douglas), and Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood), his daughter, are shown in ""flashback"" fashion throughout the film, so you pretty much know what drives Charlie to do some of the things he does, and how Miranda has had to cope with two dysfunctional parents.The center of Charlie's seeming delusion is what drives this film, and with it, the method of Charlie's madness. All of the weird things Miranda had to deal with as a child, and now young adult, become clear, as she comes to the realization of how much her father REALLY loved her.Evan Rachel Wood just keeps getting better at her craft. I can't wait to see what she does next! Here is an actor to look out for! Michael Douglas, well, he's a chip off the old block, alright! His father Kirk would be proud! I've seen him in just about everything except Science Fiction, and he is an extremely competent actor.

The bi-polar Charlie is played by Michael Douglas and sixteen-year-old Miranda by Evan Rachel Wood. The story is told from the put-upon Miranda's point-of-view and supplemented with both her voiceover narration and the occasional flashback.In the flashbacks a younger Miranda is convincingly played by a pre -""Sonny with a Chance"" Allisyn Ashley Arm. Arm was not just an excellent physical match for Wood, but a stylistic one as well; the two actresses share a non-verbal acting style,  gently teasing their portrayal of a character who does a whole lot of on-camera processing of her father's often baffling and exasperating antics. In several flashbacks single parent Charlie sends his nine-year-old daughter to school with a diorama of a California mission (presumably the one in San Fernando) they just constructed, littered with ""the bodies of the Chumash Indians, who died of Syphilis and Influenza, infected by the missionaries"".  The film's most visually compelling sequence is nine-year-old Miranda striding home hurt and angry after the diorama has landed her in trouble at school, betrayed by her father's poor judgement.Charlie is obsessed with the notion that the long-lost treasure of Spanish explorer Father Juan Florismarte Torres is buried somewhere near their Santa Clarita Valley house. As Miranda reads the Torres journal in voiceover, she and Charlie retrace the path of his expedition across the valley in search of the treasure he buried. There is a political element to the story in the juxtaposing of descriptions of old California with images of the suburban sprawl that has obliterated much of the state's history. This is further illustrated by Miranda's adaptive qualities and Charlie's stubborn refusal to adapt; it is the only significant difference between the two characters and introduces a lot of poignancy into the story because the quality they admire the most in each other is the one they do not share.For Miranda, having Charlie as a father is a Southern California version of ""Alice and Wonderland"".  Her self-reliant character is positioned midway between Alice and young heroine Jeliza-Rose in Terry Gilliam's Tideland (2005). And she shares many of their virtues; innocence, courage, curiosity, wonder, kindness, intelligence, courtesy, dignity, and a sense of justice. While she shares Alice's irritation with the rude and illogical situations they encounter in their respective wonderlands, she is considerably more adaptable. Alice was a confident and proper little Victorian girl who expected a certain standard of behavior, while Miranda and Jeliza Rose are skilled at making the best of a variety of sucky situations.Physically Wood has never looked better, like Audrey Hepburn she is more dazzling with minimal makeup and everyday fashions - including a McDonald's uniform. She simply glows in the final sequence's extreme close-ups, standing on a bluff above the beach as she processes the predicted illegal landing of a group of Chinese boat people.  And in this moment she totally sells the story, which at its core is simply the story of a father and daughter with a unqualified love for each other.  Interestingly, Wood is so effective in this final sequence that she turns what in normal screenplay structure would be the aftermath, into the film's climatic moment; then they go out with the credits.Then again, what do I know?
