Action runs through the movie while at the same time you get to see an angle of the Muslim culture that does not get into the daily news.  A muslim leader who lives in NYC is identified by the Turkish secret service as a wanted terrorist in Turkey.  So the Turkish police put a call out to the FBI to apprehend the muslim leader.  Then all of the action begins as the Turkish secret police along with the FBI try to apprehend and hold the leader until they can get him deported to Turkey.  Then the surprise turns in the story begin.  Watch it!  You will find that the time spent watching the movie will be worth your while.

Meanwhile in the US, FBI agent David Becker (Robert Patrick) arrests the calmly praying Hadji Gumus in his home. Gumus fits the description of ""Dejjal"" (Anti-Christ) an internationally wanted terrorist who has lived in the US with no criminal record. Hadji's wife Maria (Gina Gershan) is alarmed by the arrest and doesn't believe the charges. Danny Glover plays Marcus who wants to prevent the deportation.We quickly discover Becker is a man with conservative views, one that might be considered anti-Islam as he has to deal with two Turkish agents who come to NYC to pick up the prisoner. When Danny Glover orchestrates an improbable rescue of Hadji, the two Turkish agents (Mahsun Kirmizig&uuml;l, Mustafa Sandal) go rogue to find him. Is Hadji a terrorist or do they have the wrong guy? That is the question put to the viewer as the plot develops and takes a twist.The movie contains killing, good blood splatter with head shot, torture, rocket launchers, flame throwers, and three men in Muslim woman's garb who whip off their top layer and start firing with automatic weapons. The flames coming from the weapons is CG. More drama than action-thriller.2 MF bombs.

1531388,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B007IK1RRU,Tony Heck,"[4, 8]","""We're both able to figure people out at a glance. We've got the wrong guy."" After a man is taken into FBI custody for terrorist activity his wife (Gershon) wants to know why. When two Turkish agents show up in New York to bring him back an accident occurs that results in his escape. With the threat of an attack on New York looming it is a race against time to recapture him. But is he the one they really should be looking for? This is a very complicated movie to review. Much like most people's thoughts on the currant anti-terrorism strategy we want them stopped, but at the same time we don't want them involved in our everyday life. This is a movie about just that. Following leads that sometimes divert their attention from the actual problem and being so stuck on one idea that it is hard to admit you may be wrong. Without sounding too political this is a movie that points out the flaws in the system but also shows what happens when it works correctly. The acting is good and the ending will shock you and break your heart. A movie that keeps you guessing right up until the end and makes you wonder how often this really happens. This has the feel of a TV movie and the quality could have been better but that's one of the only complaints. This is a movie worth watching. Overall, a very interesting and intriguing movie about how the FBI tracks terrorists and what happens when they are wrong.
