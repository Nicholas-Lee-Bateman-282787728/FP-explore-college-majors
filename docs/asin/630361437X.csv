381860,A1PASRZ81DY9C,630361437X,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 11/03, 8/13Rate: 78/13: Above the Rim comes close as the film with the best basketball scenes filmed although Hoop Dreams is unbeatable in that department. However, there are way too many WWF style moments in the Shoot-Out tournament that simply defy logic with the most uncalled flagrant fouls. The organizers might as well take the referees out of the equation since they serve no purpose. As for the acting, Tupac Shakur and Duane Martin are terrific and outstanding in every aspect. Tupac, without a doubt a talented actor, has the most captivating presence in every scene he is in, and Duane Martin is unbelievable with his basketball skills. On the other hand, much more can be done for Leon's character of Tommy Sheppard. I find him to be underwhelming. The more mysterious he is, the better the film can be. It's one of the fewest sore spots of the film. The way he carries himself throughout the picture, I just don't see what's the big deal. Marlon Wayans is unnecessarily forced to make a fool out of himself as the Bugaloo character. That takes a bite out of the overall equation of Above the Rim. Although I find Kyle Lee Watson's attitude and selfishness annoying, Jeff Pollack has a point to deliver and does it almost well enough. All in all, Above the Rim is not bad of a film and is worth watching for the basketball scenes alone.",4,The Alternate Version of Hoop Dreams.,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,1356,"['Viewed', '11/03', '8/13Rate', '78/13', 'Rim', 'close', 'film', 'best', 'basketball', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'unbeatable', 'department', 'However', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'WWF', 'style', 'moments', 'Shoot-Out', 'tournament', 'simply', 'logic', 'most', 'uncalled', 'flagrant', 'fouls', 'organizers', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'take', 'referees', 'equation', 'serve', 'purpose', 'acting', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'are', 'terrific', 'outstanding', 'aspect', 'Tupac', 'doubt', 'talented', 'actor', 'most', 'captivating', 'presence', 'scene', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'unbelievable', 'basketball', 'skills', 'other', 'hand', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Leon', 'character', 'Tommy', 'Sheppard', 'find', 'be', 'underwhelming', 'more', 'mysterious', 'better', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'fewest', 'sore', 'spots', 'film', 'way', 'picture', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'unnecessarily', 'forced', 'make', 'fool', 'Bugaloo', 'character', 'bite', 'overall', 'equation', 'Above', 'Rim', 'find', 'Kyle', 'Lee', 'Watson', 'attitude', 'selfishness', 'annoying', 'Jeff', 'Pollack', 'point', 'deliver', 'almost', 'well', 'enough', 'Rim', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'basketball', 'alone']",Above the Rim VHS

Two actors to watch who are very charismatic - Leon and Tupac Shakur (whose murder robbed the screen of a very fine talent).  The former exudes a quiet power reminiscent of Lawrence Fishberne; the latter has amazing eyes with incredibly curly lashes.  Another note:  I haven't seen a movie that looked this sharp and clear, whose colors were crisp and bright, in many a year.  And the basketball shots during the ""tournament""!  Wow!  What editing!  Whoever did that really knew his stuff.  The story was fairly hokey - good guy, bad guy, competing for the young basketball whiz, and fairly predictable.  I did think his overblown jealousy of his mom dating Leon a little too too.  But Shakur's portrayal of the local king-pin was very effective.

Not every urban film needs to provide the harsh narrative morals of films like &quot;Boyz N The Hood&quot;. Those expecting a pull-no-punches commentary on young inner-city athletes may want to stick with &quot;He Got Game&quot;. &quot;Rim&quot; has heart though. It's predictable and cliche at times but it's still a lot of fun. Having one of the very best soundtracks of the year didn't hurt things either.&quot;Rim&quot; follows Kyle Waston, one of the hottest high school basketball prospects as he must choose between playing for his overbearing coach or a charismatic local drug dealer in a tournament for city bragging rights. Along the way we learn that the devilish drug pusher is the younger brother of the school's security guard, a former high school star himself who fell from grace after a fatal accident involving one of his friends. Kyle is so manipulated by the money and women being thrown in his direction that he doesn't see that he may be flushing his opportunity down the toilet.&quot;Above The Rim&quot;, much like &quot;Juice&quot; gains so much credibilty from the presence of Tupac Shakur. Pac takes what is in all honesty, a silly and very sterotypical villian and makes him seem so much more. Very few people have the energy and charisma to make it work but he does. The cast certainly holds up their end though as well. Unlike &quot;Juice&quot;, the movie can survive without Pac on the screen. Wayans as the goofy Buggalo is a nice touch and Martin and Leon are solid leads.ABTR is an entertaining film but it plays more like a &quot;very special episode&quot; of FRESH PRINCE than the urban equivallent of HOOSIERS that so many of its fans tend to label it as. The story is very paint-by-numbers and most of the dramatic elements are thrown in for advancement of the story rather than based on a concious decision to show the true consequences of its protaginist's choices. The script is simple and seems to pander to the audience far too much. Much like a TV show, there is conflict but by the end of it all, every character learns a valuable lesson.",3,ABOVE THE RIM Review,1069804800,"11 26, 2003",2003,2246,"['Playing', 'big-screen', 'version', 'MTV', 'quot', 'Rock', 'N', 'Jock', 'Basketball', 'quot', 'THE', 'RIM', 'more', 'flare', 'substance', ""n't"", 'neccessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Not', 'urban', 'film', 'needs', 'provide', 'harsh', 'narrative', 'morals', 'films', 'quot', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'quot', 'expecting', 'pull-no-punches', 'commentary', 'young', 'inner-city', 'athletes', 'may', 'want', 'stick', 'quot', 'Got', 'Game', 'quot', 'quot', 'Rim', 'quot', 'heart', 'predictable', 'cliche', 'times', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'Having', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'soundtracks', 'year', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'things', 'either.', 'quot', 'Rim', 'quot', 'Kyle', 'Waston', 'one', 'hottest', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'prospects', 'must', 'choose', 'playing', 'overbearing', 'coach', 'charismatic', 'local', 'drug', 'dealer', 'tournament', 'city', 'bragging', 'rights', 'way', 'learn', 'devilish', 'drug', 'pusher', 'younger', 'brother', 'school', 'security', 'guard', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'star', 'who', 'fell', 'grace', 'fatal', 'accident', 'involving', 'one', 'friends', 'Kyle', 'so', 'manipulated', 'money', 'women', 'being', 'thrown', 'direction', ""n't"", 'see', 'may', 'be', 'flushing', 'opportunity', 'down', 'toilet.', 'quot', 'Rim', 'quot', 'much', 'quot', 'Juice', 'quot', 'gains', 'so', 'much', 'credibilty', 'presence', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'Pac', 'what', 'honesty', 'silly', 'very', 'sterotypical', 'villian', 'seem', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Very', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'energy', 'charisma', 'make', 'work', 'cast', 'certainly', 'up', 'end', 'as', 'well', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'Juice', 'quot', 'movie', 'can', 'survive', 'Pac', 'screen', 'Wayans', 'goofy', 'Buggalo', 'nice', 'touch', 'Martin', 'Leon', 'are', 'solid', 'leads.ABTR', 'entertaining', 'film', 'more', 'quot', 'very', 'special', 'episode', 'quot', 'FRESH', 'PRINCE', 'urban', 'equivallent', 'HOOSIERS', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'tend', 'label', 'story', 'very', 'paint-by-numbers', 'most', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'are', 'thrown', 'advancement', 'story', 'rather', 'based', 'concious', 'decision', 'show', 'true', 'consequences', 'protaginist', 'choices', 'script', 'simple', 'pander', 'audience', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Much', 'TV', 'show', 'conflict', 'end', 'character', 'valuable', 'lesson']",Above the Rim VHS
381864,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,630361437X,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[0, 0]","""Above the Rim"" is about the city game of basketball, played on asphalt in a rough, physical style, where the rewards are status and glory in the neighborhood. It was shot on location in Harlem, and especially at Rucker's Playground, a legendary court where, in the 1970s, visiting stars like Wilt Chamberlain and Julius Erving would drop by to play with the local heroes.The movie moves the action up to the present and tells the story of a high school basketball whiz named Kyle (Duane Martin) who has attracted the attention of top college scouts. A Georgetown recruiter has been in the stands for several games. Kyle dreams of someday playing in the NBA and waits anxiously for a letter of intent from Georgetown, which doesn't come - maybe because, in an attempt to impress the scout, he's been hogging the ball and taking unwise shots.Parallel to high school basketball, but in a world of its own, is the neighborhood Shoot-Out, a tournament held at Rucker's Playground with teams sponsored by local merchants, including drug dealers. Kyle plans to play for a team run by his school coach. But then his best friend, Bugaloo (Marlon Wayans), talks him into visiting a club run by the sinister Birdie (Tupac Shakur), and the kid is seduced by its shabby glamor into agreeing to play for Birdie's team.This is not a wise move. Birdie is a drug dealer, and that's a fact well-known to the tall, silent Shep (Leon), a former Rucker's star who moved out of town but is now back as a security guard at the high school. Shep was once friendly with Kyle's mother (Tonya Pinkins), and now, as they begin to see each other again, he tries to guide Kyle in the direction of college, and away from the superficial glories of the Shoot-Out.The movie climaxes, of course, with the big Shoot-Out game, and with a violent surprise that I found less than likely. But that's not really what it's about. It's more about the dreams of poor black kids to use their basketball skills as a ticket out of the inner city.This is an elusive dream, as the brilliant Chicago-based documentary ""Hoop Dreams"" demonstrates. Only a tiny percentage of high school stars ever play in college, let alone in the NBA. But kids like Kyle can't help hoping. And both Shep and his mother point out that education, not the NBA ticket, is the real reason to go to school.The movie lives easily on the streets where it is shot, and the performances - especially by Martin, Shakur and Pinkins - are convincing. We get a sense of the daily rhythm of the character's lives, and for a drama, the movie finds room for a surprising amount of humor, especially in the dialogue.The movie, directed by Jeff Pollack, was co-written by Pollack and Barry Michael Cooper, who wrote the poetic and evocative Wesley Snipes drama ""Sugar Hill."" In both films Cooper has a strong interest in family, in how extended support networks can fill some of the gaps left by the disintegration of the traditional family unit.Here Kyle is a kid in a lot of potential trouble, but also with a lot of good support.My complaint about the movie is that the plot goes on automatic pilot in creating the character of Birdie. The neighborhood drug dealer is such a standard cliche by now that it's almost as if they plugged him into the movie as a shortcut to a villain. Shakur plays him well, and he makes a satisfactory bad guy, but the subliminal message is that drugs are where the money is. The movie could have come up with more original choices.",4,Kinda Generic,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,3480,"['Rim', 'city', 'game', 'basketball', 'played', 'asphalt', 'rough', 'physical', 'style', 'where', 'rewards', 'are', 'status', 'glory', 'neighborhood', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Harlem', 'especially', 'Rucker', 'Playground', 'legendary', 'court', 'where', '1970s', 'visiting', 'stars', 'Wilt', 'Chamberlain', 'Julius', 'Erving', 'would', 'drop', 'play', 'local', 'heroes.The', 'movie', 'action', 'up', 'present', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'whiz', 'named', 'Kyle', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'who', 'attracted', 'attention', 'top', 'college', 'scouts', 'Georgetown', 'recruiter', 'been', 'stands', 'several', 'games', 'Kyle', 'dreams', 'someday', 'playing', 'NBA', 'anxiously', 'letter', 'intent', 'Georgetown', ""n't"", 'come', 'maybe', 'attempt', 'impress', 'scout', 'been', 'hogging', 'ball', 'taking', 'unwise', 'shots.Parallel', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'world', 'own', 'neighborhood', 'Shoot-Out', 'tournament', 'held', 'Rucker', 'Playground', 'teams', 'sponsored', 'local', 'merchants', 'including', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Kyle', 'play', 'team', 'run', 'school', 'coach', 'then', 'best', 'friend', 'Bugaloo', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'visiting', 'club', 'run', 'sinister', 'Birdie', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'kid', 'seduced', 'shabby', 'glamor', 'agreeing', 'play', 'Birdie', 'team.This', 'not', 'wise', 'move', 'Birdie', 'drug', 'dealer', 'fact', 'well-known', 'tall', 'silent', 'Shep', 'Leon', 'former', 'Rucker', 'star', 'who', 'moved', 'out', 'town', 'now', 'back', 'security', 'guard', 'high', 'school', 'Shep', 'was', 'once', 'friendly', 'Kyle', 'mother', 'Tonya', 'Pinkins', 'now', 'begin', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'guide', 'Kyle', 'direction', 'college', 'away', 'superficial', 'glories', 'Shoot-Out.The', 'movie', 'climaxes', 'course', 'big', 'Shoot-Out', 'game', 'violent', 'surprise', 'found', 'less', 'likely', 'not', 'really', 'what', 'about', 'more', 'dreams', 'poor', 'black', 'kids', 'use', 'basketball', 'skills', 'ticket', 'inner', 'city.This', 'elusive', 'dream', 'brilliant', 'Chicago-based', 'documentary', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'Only', 'tiny', 'percentage', 'high', 'school', 'stars', 'ever', 'play', 'college', 'let', 'alone', 'NBA', 'kids', 'Kyle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'hoping', 'Shep', 'mother', 'point', 'out', 'education', 'not', 'NBA', 'ticket', 'real', 'reason', 'go', 'school.The', 'movie', 'lives', 'easily', 'streets', 'where', 'shot', 'performances', 'especially', 'Martin', 'Shakur', 'Pinkins', 'are', 'convincing', 'get', 'sense', 'daily', 'rhythm', 'character', 'lives', 'drama', 'movie', 'room', 'surprising', 'amount', 'humor', 'especially', 'dialogue.The', 'movie', 'directed', 'Jeff', 'Pollack', 'was', 'co-written', 'Pollack', 'Barry', 'Michael', 'Cooper', 'who', 'wrote', 'poetic', 'evocative', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'drama', 'Sugar', 'Hill', 'films', 'Cooper', 'strong', 'interest', 'family', 'how', 'extended', 'support', 'networks', 'can', 'fill', 'gaps', 'left', 'disintegration', 'traditional', 'family', 'unit.Here', 'Kyle', 'kid', 'lot', 'potential', 'trouble', 'also', 'lot', 'good', 'support.My', 'complaint', 'movie', 'plot', 'automatic', 'pilot', 'creating', 'character', 'Birdie', 'neighborhood', 'drug', 'dealer', 'standard', 'cliche', 'now', 'almost', 'plugged', 'movie', 'shortcut', 'villain', 'Shakur', 'well', 'satisfactory', 'bad', 'guy', 'subliminal', 'message', 'drugs', 'are', 'where', 'money', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'more', 'original', 'choices']",Above the Rim VHS

381876,A1UUVQS8X31RH1,630361437X,Kalie A. Gipson,"[1, 2]","The 1995 classic basketball movie ""Above The Rim"" is a great movie, even though it is going on ten years old. However, time can not erase the fact that this movie is spectacular. The cast of characters is good, the script is good, and overall this is an awesome movie if you're a fan of Tupac Shakur, or just a fan of basketball movies with more than just basketball in it.The story is about Kyle Watson (Duane Martin) and Tommy ""Shep"" Sheppard (Leon). Kyle is really into basketball and he plays for the high school team, but he's a little self centered on the court. When his friend Bugaloo (Marlon Wayans) busts out of jail, he introduces Kyle to Birdie (Tupac Shakur), who wants to put Kyle on his annual Shoot Out Tournament team. Even though Kyle told his coach he was going to play for him in the shoot-out, he decides to play for Birdie, as he offers him somewhat of a better or good life. This part of the story is kinda cliche, either sell your soul for riches or do the right thing and go the better way out. Which one will Kyle choose when it's time? Shep has a story of his own. From what I could tell, Shep was a very good ballplayer when he was Kyle's age. Due to a certain tragedy, Shep threw it all away. Shep comes back from where he ran to, and ends up meeting Kyle's mother, and starts dating her. Kyle doesn't like Shep at all, due to a little bit of Birdie's influence, who is tied to Shep. Turns out, Shep helps Kyle throughout the movie.There is not many extras on the DVD though. You could either get this on VHS or DVD and have the exact same thing. The movie has a great cast to back it up: Duane Martin, Marlon Wayans, Leon, Tupac Shakur, Tonya Pinkins, Bernie Mac, etc. They are all great in their roles. Despite being just about a decade old, this movie stands the test of time for me. It also has a great soundtrack, featuring hits such as ""Regulate"" by Nate Dogg and Warren G, and ""Pour Out A Little Liquor"" by 2Pac, and ""Pain"" by 2Pac and the Outlaws, which is one of my favorite songs. It really fits with the movie when they play it.However cliche the storyline may be, this is still an excellent movie. The acting is tremendous, especially by Tupac and Marlon Wayans. This movie also established Leon and Marlon as 2 of my favorite actors. If you're looking for a great basketball movie with enough drama to keep you entertained, other than basketball, then this is the movie for you. This is also a good addition to your 2Pac collection (R.I.P.)

You couldn't tell the difference. He has this snide, dirty, narcissistic persona that has an incredibly hot temper that you may not ever know that you've crossed--ever! He is the best and gets 5 stars for his performance. Duane Martin(Watson) does a good job with the arrogant--not as good as he wants to be or hypes himself up to be--phenom athlete and gets 4.5 stars; this is the main character. Leon(Shep) is the ""NBA caliber""player who is always running from his potential; brother and enemy of Birdie. He gets 4 stars. Marion Wayans and Bernie Mac also get 4.5 stars in limited roles and understand their roles well(don't try to do too much and blend into the background). The actors also mesh together like old sitcom veterans. The basketball scenes are average to good with too much replaying of the same scenes at times. Leon being toppled on the concrete as if it were wood and getting up and playing on was over-the-top and not believable. The refs were also not believable; they let Birdie's men get away with murder and then they changed to Shep and Watson's side. They would have been believable if Birdie had bought them and they remained bad for Birdie's goons, but it made me wonder when they started giving the other side calls. Either you're a clean ref that misses a few calls, a clean ref not good enough to be a good ref, or you're dirty. These refs are worse than dirty or inept; they are indecisive about which calls-- that they can see as clear as day--they will make and they make none. That being said, the positives make the negatives look like dust--which is easily gone. My favorite lines: Most of Tupac's lines, exs. The one where he disses Marlon about the wheelchair league and calls him a ""joke"", the one where he disses his brother and says--while joking about Shep not reaching his potential and to his face--""you're a security guard...you're keeping our high schools safe."", the one where he and his brother are at their mother's grave and he's trying to recruit his older brother into his fold of thugs, etc. This movie gets 5 stars for those reasons!",4,"Don't Agree /w Tupac's Profession, but man can act & you'll see it here!",1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,2220,"['Tupac', 'was', 'comedian', 'group', 'even', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'movie', 'have', 'better', 'resume', 'comedy', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'snide', 'dirty', 'narcissistic', 'persona', 'incredibly', 'hot', 'temper', 'may', 'not', 'ever', 'know', ""'ve"", 'crossed', 'ever', 'best', '5', 'stars', 'performance', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'Watson', 'good', 'job', 'arrogant', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'be', 'hypes', 'up', 'be', 'phenom', 'athlete', '4.5', 'stars', 'main', 'character', 'Leon', 'Shep', 'NBA', 'caliber', 'player', 'who', 'always', 'running', 'potential', 'brother', 'enemy', 'Birdie', '4', 'stars', 'Marion', 'Wayans', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'also', 'get', '4.5', 'stars', 'limited', 'roles', 'understand', 'roles', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'blend', 'background', 'actors', 'also', 'mesh', 'together', 'old', 'sitcom', 'veterans', 'basketball', 'scenes', 'are', 'average', 'good', 'too', 'much', 'replaying', 'same', 'scenes', 'times', 'Leon', 'being', 'toppled', 'concrete', 'were', 'wood', 'getting', 'up', 'playing', 'was', 'over-the-top', 'not', 'believable', 'refs', 'were', 'also', 'not', 'believable', 'let', 'Birdie', 'men', 'get', 'away', 'murder', 'then', 'changed', 'Shep', 'Watson', 'side', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'believable', 'Birdie', 'had', 'bought', 'remained', 'bad', 'Birdie', 'goons', 'made', 'wonder', 'when', 'started', 'giving', 'other', 'side', ""'re"", 'clean', 'ref', 'few', 'calls', 'clean', 'ref', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'good', 'ref', ""'re"", 'dirty', 'refs', 'are', 'worse', 'dirty', 'inept', 'are', 'indecisive', 'can', 'see', 'as', 'clear', 'day', 'will', 'make', 'make', 'none', 'being', 'said', 'positives', 'make', 'negatives', 'look', 'dust', 'easily', 'gone', 'favorite', 'lines', 'Most', 'Tupac', 'lines', 'exs', 'one', 'where', 'Marlon', 'wheelchair', 'league', 'joke', 'one', 'where', 'brother', 'joking', 'about', 'Shep', 'not', 'reaching', 'potential', 'face', ""'re"", 'security', 'guard', ""'re"", 'keeping', 'high', 'schools', 'safe', 'one', 'where', 'brother', 'are', 'mother', 'grave', 'trying', 'recruit', 'older', 'brother', 'fold', 'thugs', 'etc', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'reasons']",Above the Rim VHS

381882,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,630361437X,Michael Crane,"[14, 18]","""Above the Rim"" is an entertaining street drama that focuses around Kyle Lee Watson, an inner-city high school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his own arrogance get the best of him.  He won't listen to anybody who offers him advice on how to improve his game, as he thinks that he is the best player ever.  He's been hoping that his mad skills are catching a college scout's attention, but he does catch Birdie's eyes when he plays.  Birdie is a well known gang leader who offers Kyle the good life so long as he plays on his neighborhood team in a ""Shoot-Out"" basketball contest that means the world to him.  Kyle--being impatient as ever--agrees to join, not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him.  A high school security guard with a past knows the danger that Birdie presents, and he is the only who has a chance to get through to Kyle before it is too late.Not only is this a very good basketball movie, but it is also an intense and character-driven drama centered around the choices that we make in life... and how we have to live with them in the long run.  The film has some great performances from Duane Martin, Marlon Wayans and the late Tupac Shakur.  Even though everybody is great in their roles, the showstopper is indeed Shakur.  He gives a very masterful performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long after the movie is over.  My only complaint is the length of the movie.  It's true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and a half isn't short, but I think the story and the characters open more possibilities to add on to the movie.  I think more opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich the story.  Still, it is a really good movie that didn't disappoint me.The DVD doesn't have a whole lot to offer.  You can either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen, depending on your preference.  The movie looks and sounds very good.  The only special features that are offered are movie trailers, and those aren't even that great.  I would've loved it if they included the music video, ""Regulate"" by Warren G and Nate Dogg.  In fact, given some of the great rap songs that are in this movie, they could've included a couple of music videos.  It's not a great DVD, but at least it's not that expensive.I really enjoyed ""Above the Rim.""  It may not be flawless, but it definitely does more right than wrong.  The characters are what really dominate the movie.  Even if you're not a fan of the game, it's still something to check out if you're a fan of character drama.  Exciting, intense, conflict-driven and full of heart, ""Above the Rim"" is a very well done film. -Michael Crane",4,Choices and Consequences...,1094169600,"09 3, 2004",2004,2678,"['Rim', 'entertaining', 'street', 'drama', 'Kyle', 'Lee', 'Watson', 'inner-city', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'player', 'who', 'lot', 'promise', 'own', 'arrogance', 'get', 'best', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'anybody', 'who', 'advice', 'how', 'improve', 'game', 'best', 'player', 'ever', 'been', 'hoping', 'mad', 'skills', 'are', 'catching', 'college', 'scout', 'attention', 'catch', 'Birdie', 'eyes', 'when', 'Birdie', 'well', 'known', 'gang', 'leader', 'who', 'Kyle', 'good', 'life', 'so', 'long', 'neighborhood', 'team', 'Shoot-Out', 'basketball', 'contest', 'world', 'Kyle', 'being', 'impatient', 'ever', 'join', 'not', 'seeing', 'clear', 'danger', 'front', 'high', 'school', 'security', 'guard', 'past', 'danger', 'Birdie', 'presents', 'only', 'who', 'chance', 'get', 'Kyle', 'too', 'late.Not', 'only', 'very', 'good', 'basketball', 'movie', 'also', 'intense', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'centered', 'choices', 'make', 'life', 'how', 'have', 'live', 'long', 'run', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'late', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'Even', 'everybody', 'great', 'roles', 'showstopper', 'indeed', 'Shakur', 'very', 'masterful', 'performance', 'really', 'out', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'movie', 'only', 'complaint', 'length', 'movie', 'true', 'movie', 'little', 'hour', 'half', ""n't"", 'short', 'think', 'story', 'characters', 'open', 'more', 'possibilities', 'add', 'movie', 'think', 'more', 'opportunities', 'risks', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'further', 'enrich', 'story', 'Still', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'me.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'offer', 'can', 'either', 'watch', 'movie', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'depending', 'preference', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'offered', 'are', 'movie', 'trailers', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'great', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'included', 'music', 'video', 'Regulate', 'Warren', 'G', 'Nate', 'Dogg', 'fact', 'given', 'great', 'rap', 'songs', 'are', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'included', 'couple', 'music', 'videos', 'not', 'great', 'DVD', 'least', 'not', 'expensive.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Rim', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'flawless', 'definitely', 'more', 'right', 'wrong', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'dominate', 'movie', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'game', 'still', 'something', 'check', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'character', 'drama', 'Exciting', 'intense', 'conflict-driven', 'full', 'heart', 'Rim', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', '-Michael', 'Crane']",Above the Rim VHS
