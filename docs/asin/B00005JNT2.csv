The story deals with Tommy Lee Jones protecting his witnesses of a murder from the bad guys, just that these witnesses are cheerleaders! So Jones is in his element as the unemotional and super-stiff cop, in charge of a bunch of bubbly teenagers. A slightly sad part about this movie is that it touches some interesting themes and characters, but does little in completely realising the potential of these characters or the complexity of their interplay. But there are loads of situations where there is wonderful humor, accentuated by the contrasting cast!The plot has several holes and honestly is not really gripping, with too many side threads grabbing attention, but then this is one movie to be seen with an open mind and with the intent of enjoying the light hearted comedy that it is!

634853,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JNT2,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[4, 7]","Man of the House is a comedy/action film starring Tommy Lee Jones in the main role as a Texas Ranger who is trying to solve a murder case. To assist him in solving the case, Jones rounds up a group of five Texas Longhorn Cheerleaders- the only people who are known to have witnessed the murder. To protect these witnesses from the general public, Jones moves in with them and lives at their campus residence.Most of the comedy part of this film is supplied by the interaction between Jones and the cheerleaders. He has nothing in common with these young women and he is annoyed by many things they do. But he also knows they are witnesses to a crime he is determined to solve, so he tolerates their differences.The action part of this movie comes when Jones is searching for the person who committed this crime. There is some blood and gore in this film, but it is kept under control enough to avoid receiving an ""R"" rating. These parts of the film provide some good contrast to the humor, but it also adds to the movie's instability, if you will. You never know what direction the film is going to take or whether or not it's a comedy or a drama.I like Tommy Lee Jones, but I think his performance in this movie is rather tired and uninspired. Anne Archer is good, but her role is minimal. The women who play the cheerleaders are ok, but nothing special and their roles could have easily been played by other actresses with equal effectiveness. Speaking of the cheerleaders, they are very stereotypical and this could bother some viewers. There is a cheerleader to represent different races and they are generally not very bright- typical of what you find in this type of movie. They don't play much of a role in the movie either, except (apparently) to give men something to look at.There are some flaws in this movie, but I still liked it well enough to recommend it. The film has some fun moments and Tommy Lee Jones, while not at his best, is good enough to make the movie memorable.",3,Tommy Lee Jones Tames Some Texas Cheerleaders,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,1988,"['Man', 'House', 'comedy/action', 'film', 'starring', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'main', 'role', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'who', 'trying', 'solve', 'murder', 'case', 'assist', 'solving', 'case', 'Jones', 'up', 'group', 'five', 'Texas', 'Longhorn', 'Cheerleaders-', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'known', 'have', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'protect', 'witnesses', 'general', 'public', 'Jones', 'lives', 'campus', 'residence.Most', 'comedy', 'part', 'film', 'supplied', 'interaction', 'Jones', 'cheerleaders', 'nothing', 'common', 'young', 'women', 'annoyed', 'many', 'things', 'do', 'also', 'are', 'witnesses', 'crime', 'determined', 'solve', 'differences.The', 'action', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'Jones', 'searching', 'person', 'who', 'committed', 'crime', 'blood', 'gore', 'film', 'kept', 'control', 'enough', 'avoid', 'receiving', 'R', 'rating', 'parts', 'film', 'provide', 'good', 'contrast', 'humor', 'also', 'movie', 'instability', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'direction', 'film', 'going', 'take', 'not', 'comedy', 'drama.I', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'think', 'performance', 'movie', 'rather', 'tired', 'uninspired', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'good', 'role', 'minimal', 'women', 'who', 'play', 'cheerleaders', 'are', 'ok', 'nothing', 'special', 'roles', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'played', 'other', 'actresses', 'equal', 'effectiveness', 'Speaking', 'cheerleaders', 'are', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'could', 'bother', 'viewers', 'cheerleader', 'represent', 'different', 'races', 'are', 'generally', 'not', 'very', 'bright-', 'typical', 'what', 'find', 'type', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'much', 'role', 'movie', 'apparently', 'give', 'men', 'something', 'look', 'are', 'flaws', 'movie', 'still', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'recommend', 'film', 'fun', 'moments', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'not', 'best', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'memorable']",Man of the House

The 5 girls were positive, not a bit dumb and supported one another all along. How they inspired Tommy Lee Jones to transform from a man who could not express his feelings publicly as a Dad, a lover and a coach into a lovable guy was actually the main theme.

I liked Christina Milian best among the girls. Her dance was dynamic and energetic. Anne Archer was the credible love interest and I wished her part could be bigger.The one scene that I couldn't help laughing aloud was when Cedric the Entertainer danced against the 5 girls, trying to perform his old school style of cheer leader dancing.

I knew the film would be pretty stupid - and it was - but I have to admit I was rather pleasantly surprised by Man of the House (and not only because I happily discovered that Monica Keena was also in it).  Putting the dour-faced Tommy Lee Jones in the middle of five giddy cheerleaders is definitely good for some laughs, and the characters really started to grow on me after the first half hour of extremely stereotyped characterization finally faded away.  Texas Ranger Roland Sharp (Tommy Lee Jones) stalks around like he's impervious to any danger, and the cheerleaders are seriously dumbed down when we first meet them - this superficial treatment doesn't do the movie any favors coming out of the gate.Here's the basic story.  Five University of Texas cheerleaders witness the murder of a government witness being sought by Sharp to testify against some high-level criminal.  Thus, the girls are the only witnesses that stand in the way of Mr. Moneybags' freedom from prosecution - despite the fact that they can't even begin to come up with a description of the man they saw pull the trigger.  Sharp is given the job of protecting the girls, which makes him the girls' newest roommate back on campus.  The girls, being silly cheerleaders, don't think they are in danger and balk at everything the ultra-serious Ranger asks them to do.  He, of course, has a problem with their skimpy outfits (for reasons I certainly can't fathom), unmentionables in the bathroom, etc.  Eventually, though, they develop a sort of friendship, with the girls helping Sharp reconnect with his daughter and woo a lady professor and Sharp loosening up and having a little bit of fun.There are some pretty funny scenes in the film, especially when Sharp is playing the part of the new assistant cheerleading coach (and getting some cheers of his own at one of the football games).  I was a little disappointed that Cedric the Entertainer had a much smaller role than I expected, but that man always makes the most of his minutes.  I do wish the film had been set at some other university than Texas because I don't like their coach (who, fortunately, didn't appear in the film - although Texas Governor Perry did have a quick cameo) and because their cheerleaders have some of the most unappealing cheerleading outfits I know of.  Still, this is a funny movie that makes for a surprisingly enjoyable way to spend a little over an hour and a half.",4,More entertaining than I expected it to be,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,2582,"['was', ""n't"", 'that', 'excited', 'seeing', 'movie', 'did', 'feature', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'as', 'well', 'cheerleaders', 'went', 'ahead', 'watched', 'knew', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'was', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'rather', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Man', 'House', 'not', 'only', 'happily', 'discovered', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'was', 'also', 'Putting', 'dour-faced', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'middle', 'five', 'giddy', 'cheerleaders', 'definitely', 'good', 'laughs', 'characters', 'really', 'started', 'grow', 'first', 'hour', 'extremely', 'stereotyped', 'characterization', 'finally', 'faded', 'away', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'Roland', 'Sharp', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'stalks', 'impervious', 'danger', 'cheerleaders', 'are', 'seriously', 'dumbed', 'down', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'superficial', 'treatment', ""n't"", 'do', 'movie', 'favors', 'coming', 'gate.Here', 'basic', 'story', 'Five', 'University', 'Texas', 'cheerleaders', 'witness', 'murder', 'government', 'witness', 'being', 'sought', 'Sharp', 'testify', 'high-level', 'criminal', 'Thus', 'girls', 'are', 'only', 'stand', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Moneybags', 'freedom', 'prosecution', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'come', 'up', 'description', 'man', 'saw', 'pull', 'trigger', 'Sharp', 'given', 'job', 'protecting', 'girls', 'girls', 'newest', 'roommate', 'back', 'campus', 'girls', 'being', 'silly', 'cheerleaders', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'danger', 'balk', 'everything', 'ultra-serious', 'Ranger', 'do', 'course', 'problem', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'reasons', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'bathroom', 'etc', 'Eventually', 'develop', 'sort', 'friendship', 'girls', 'helping', 'Sharp', 'reconnect', 'daughter', 'woo', 'lady', 'professor', 'Sharp', 'loosening', 'up', 'having', 'little', 'bit', 'fun.There', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'scenes', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'Sharp', 'playing', 'part', 'new', 'assistant', 'cheerleading', 'coach', 'getting', 'cheers', 'own', 'one', 'football', 'games', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'had', 'much', 'smaller', 'role', 'expected', 'man', 'always', 'most', 'minutes', 'do', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'other', 'university', 'Texas', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'coach', 'who', 'fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'film', 'Texas', 'Governor', 'Perry', 'did', 'have', 'quick', 'cameo', 'cheerleaders', 'have', 'most', 'unappealing', 'cheerleading', 'outfits', 'know', 'Still', 'funny', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', 'little', 'hour', 'half']",Man of the House

He plays a crusty Texas Ranger charged with guarding five sorority cheerleaders who witnessed a murder. He and some others are installed at their house on campus, hilarity ensues and they all finally get their man. End of storyline.An incessant favorite of mine, Cedric the Entertainer, is quite funny in his cameo role here - I think this movie was the first time I saw him on film. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure.Now let me address what I have always loved about this film aside from Jones' performance: it is truly about some strange kind of mentoring, the sort of thing I think all kids need and never get. Though one of the girls falls for the grouchy old ranger, the bigger message is that of the protection for the young offered by the older and wiser.While this is an excellent comedy and a fine family film, I wonder if anyone would catch the Big Message. The shot of Jones sitting at the dining room table alone while the girls sleep is the Father of the Year Shot, hands down, and was meant to be obvious. But I fear the message behind that iconic shot is drowned in unnecessary silliness and a few goofy laughs.Still, this film remains a perennial favorite of mine since it was released, and I have a feeling you'll like it a great deal.

634868,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B00005JNT2,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[2, 3]","There's an old clich&eacute; that a movie is funny when it puts two vastly different people (or groups of people) together for the majority of it's screen time.  For the most part, this works pretty well (that's why it got to be a clich&eacute;), but there are occasional stinkers.  ""Man of the House"", which puts Tommy Lee Jones together with a bunch of cheerleaders, is somewhere in between: Not a hit, but still a worthy effort.Roland Sharp (Tommy Lee Jones) is a very tough, serious guy.  He has to be: he's a Texas Ranger after all, the elite of Texas law enforcement.  He's on a dangerous case when, through a suspenseful, action-packed pursuit, the shady character he's trying to get to testify is shot dead by a mysterious assassin, and the only witnesses are five college cheerleaders.  Now Sharp must protect these girls from the assassin, so they can finger him.  Sure, the plot's a bit thin, with holes in places, but it's a comedy, right?  We're lucky there's a plot at all.But perhaps labeling this film as a ""comedy"" is a bit inaccurate.  This is one of those movies with an identity crisis: it doesn't seem to know if it's a goofy comedy about a stuffy old guy living with a bunch of peppy college chicks, or a dramatic suspense flick complete with explosions, car chases, and cold-blooded murder.  Most films would fall all to pieces with this kind of schizophrenic plotline, but it is a testament to Tommy Lee Jones' acting ability that he can be a tough action hero AND a straightman with a quip or two.Unfortunately for the comedy portion, most, if not all, of the best parts were given away in the trailers.  This is a common occurrence for comedies; most advertising departments seem to think it is necessary to make the trailer wall-to-wall laughs rather than surprise us by making a U-turn from dramatic to hilarious (though I have seen a trailer or two do this).The dramatic parts of this film are actually pretty good.  Sharp, a divorcee, learns to show his love for his daughter Emma (Shannon Marie Woodward) thanks to his cheerleader witnesses, and even has a romantic interest with Molly McCarthy (Anne Archer).  For a film that is mostly a comedy, these dramatic elements are handled nicely and appropriately.Cedric the Entertainer, as you probably already know, is also in ""Man of the House"" though his role as a rather unscrupulous gospel church minister isn't nearly large enough to warrant him next-to-top billing.Another thing:  the cheerleaders in ""Man of the House"" are the most stereotypical pompom shakers I have ever seen.  Poor Roland is faced with all the problems faced by anyone dealing with cheerleaders in CinemaLand: getting them unglued from cell phones, boyfriends, and pop music, as well as dealing with... um... other girl things.Speaking of which, in case you were wondering: yes, these girls are gorgeous, and, well, most of the time they don't wear much.  But you'd have to be pretty shallow to go see this movie just for THAT.",3,"Tommy Lee Jones is the man again in ""House""",1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,2981,"['old', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movie', 'funny', 'when', 'two', 'vastly', 'different', 'people', 'groups', 'people', 'together', 'majority', 'screen', 'time', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'well', 'why', 'got', 'be', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'occasional', 'stinkers', 'Man', 'House', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'together', 'bunch', 'cheerleaders', 'somewhere', 'Not', 'hit', 'still', 'worthy', 'effort.Roland', 'Sharp', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'very', 'tough', 'serious', 'guy', 'be', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'elite', 'Texas', 'law', 'enforcement', 'dangerous', 'case', 'when', 'suspenseful', 'action-packed', 'pursuit', 'shady', 'character', 'trying', 'get', 'testify', 'shot', 'dead', 'mysterious', 'assassin', 'only', 'witnesses', 'are', 'five', 'college', 'cheerleaders', 'Now', 'Sharp', 'must', 'protect', 'girls', 'assassin', 'can', 'finger', 'Sure', 'plot', 'bit', 'thin', 'holes', 'places', 'comedy', 'right', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'plot', 'all.But', 'perhaps', 'labeling', 'film', 'comedy', 'bit', 'inaccurate', 'one', 'movies', 'identity', 'crisis', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'goofy', 'comedy', 'stuffy', 'old', 'guy', 'living', 'bunch', 'peppy', 'college', 'chicks', 'dramatic', 'suspense', 'flick', 'complete', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'cold-blooded', 'murder', 'Most', 'films', 'would', 'fall', 'pieces', 'kind', 'schizophrenic', 'plotline', 'testament', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'acting', 'ability', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'action', 'hero', 'straightman', 'quip', 'two.Unfortunately', 'comedy', 'portion', 'most', 'not', 'best', 'parts', 'were', 'given', 'away', 'trailers', 'common', 'occurrence', 'comedies', 'most', 'advertising', 'departments', 'seem', 'think', 'necessary', 'make', 'trailer', 'wall-to-wall', 'rather', 'surprise', 'making', 'U-turn', 'dramatic', 'hilarious', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'two', 'do', 'dramatic', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Sharp', 'divorcee', 'show', 'love', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Shannon', 'Marie', 'Woodward', 'thanks', 'cheerleader', 'witnesses', 'even', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Molly', 'McCarthy', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'film', 'mostly', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'are', 'handled', 'nicely', 'appropriately.Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'also', 'Man', 'House', 'role', 'rather', 'unscrupulous', 'gospel', 'church', 'minister', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'large', 'enough', 'warrant', 'next-to-top', 'billing.Another', 'thing', 'cheerleaders', 'Man', 'House', 'are', 'most', 'stereotypical', 'pompom', 'shakers', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Poor', 'Roland', 'faced', 'problems', 'faced', 'anyone', 'dealing', 'cheerleaders', 'CinemaLand', 'getting', 'unglued', 'cell', 'phones', 'boyfriends', 'pop', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'dealing', 'um', 'other', 'girl', 'things.Speaking', 'case', 'were', 'wondering', 'yes', 'girls', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'well', 'most', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'much', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'pretty', 'shallow', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'just']",Man of the House

Now, some people reading this will immediately think I had my mind made up and didn't give the movie a chance, but I think most people realize that the great majority of Hollywood movies, you can tell from the previews whether you're going to like them or not.  Honestly, the only reason I watched this was because it was filmed in Austin, and yes, I recognized 90% of the locations in the movie.  But whereas I thought that might provide some kind of cheap thrill in a film that strives for cheap thrills and simply doesn't get them, the familiarity actually made the movie even duller.One thing about Tommy Lee Jones:  I know people have mentioned that he's done this kind of character before, blah blah blah.  But this is his forte.  Nobody does the stone-faced, smartass Southern authority figure quite like Tommy Lee Jones.  He certainly isn't stretching out in this role, that's for sure, but if you're a TLJ fan that will probably be the only kick you get out of this movie.  I used to be down for Cedric the Entertainer, but since he seems to be (...) himself out to every director paying cent one, the overexposure is kind of wearing me out on his presence.

634881,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNT2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 4]","""Man of the House"" is yet another film where the trailer is better than the movie.  The trailer for this 2005 comedy gives you the best line of the movie (""This IS my hap-pay face"") and the funniest moment (Tommy Lee Jones tackles the Razorback mascot), both of which come relatively early in the film.  The trailer also gives you the idea that Cedric the Entertainer is going to be a bigger part of the story than he actually ends up providing and when you do your post mortem on ""Man of the House"" you can decide if the biggest sin of the screenplay by Robert Ramsey & Matthew (no, I am not Matt) Stone and John J. McLaughlin is that it could not make better use of Cedric's presence or the more fundamental failure to punch up the predictable storyline to take advantage of the inherently humorous juxtaposition of Tommy Lee Jones and a bunch of University of Texas Cheerleaders.Jones is Roland Sharp, a dedicated and humorless Texas Ranger who has sacrificed his marriage and alienated his daughter because his job is his life.  The only thing surprising about Sharp is that his partner on the Rangers is a woman (and one of the best moments in the film is when Sharp talks about what it was like for a dinosaur like him to end up with a female partner).  But then a government witness is shot right in from of Sharp and his partner is wounded.  Sharp then ends up with the job of babysitting five Texas cheerleaders who saw a murder related to the case (the witness was going to testify against somebody who does not want to be testified against).  The cheerleaders are in danger, whether they believe it or not, and Sharp is going to keep them alive.  Although he has a pair of younger Rangers with him, they are sent across the street from the house in which the cheerleaders live and Sharp does his job mainly hearing all, seeing all, and being ahead of the game well enough to successfully put his foot down.  What chance do five young cheerleaders have against Tommy Lee Jones?  Not much, I can tell you that (his way of persuading the girls to wear clothing that exposes less of their bodies is pragmatic, but expensive).The five cheerleaders are played by Vanessa Ferlito, Paula Garc&eacute;s, Kelli Garner, Monic Keena, and Christian Millan.  The names of the cheerleaders are Anne, Barb, Evie, Heather, and Teresa.  The order of the names of the actresses and the characters are provided in alphabetical order, which means they do not match up, but then these are not really fully developed characters (just fully developed cheerleaders) so getting them confused does not matter much.  You can distinguish them on the basis of hair or skin color more than you can their shallow personalities (e.g., one has phone sex with her boyfriend while another thinks Sharp is cute).  When the girls find out that Sharp is estranged from his teenage daughter, this matters more to them than the fact someone is trying to kill them and Sharp is curtailing their liberties.  Of course, they are going to do something about that, and, of course, that is going to put them in a position to be killed.Although people do get killed in this movie, the threat is not really serious, so when the cheerleaders put themselves in harms way it is supposed to be comic.  Sharp is given a love interest in the form of Anne Archer as Professor Molly McCarthy, which sets up a cute scene where the girls talk Sharp through a date using his ear piece that unfortunately reduces Archer to a piece of furniture.  Cedric the Entertainer is Percy Stevens, an ex-con turned preacher, who shows up periodically to provide uninspired comic relief.  The fact that he ends up not being integral to the story distracted me a bit because I was not certain why he was in the film at all if they were not going to give him anything substantive to do.Apparently ""Man of the House"" was originally entitled ""Cheer Up,"" and there is a story that they did not come up with the ending until a month after the rest of the movie was shot, all of which speaks to how appealing it is to throw Tommy Lee Jones in with a bunch of cheerleaders and let him thaw out just a bit so that he can show more emotional depth than irritation.  Actually, you can argue that the best rapport between characters in the movie are those scenes pairing Jones with R. Lee Ermey as Captain Nichols, which certainly makes for a nice pair of old school stone faces where a blank stare is as good as a raised eyebrow.  But while it was never the goal to make anything more than a piece of fluff, they still should have been able to come up with a script that would have made this more of an entertaining piece of fluff.",3,Tommy Lee Jones versus five University of Texas cheerleaders,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,4658,"['Man', 'House', 'yet', 'film', 'where', 'trailer', 'better', 'movie', 'trailer', '2005', 'comedy', 'best', 'line', 'movie', 'IS', 'hap-pay', 'face', 'funniest', 'moment', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Razorback', 'mascot', 'come', 'relatively', 'early', 'film', 'trailer', 'also', 'idea', 'Entertainer', 'going', 'be', 'bigger', 'part', 'story', 'actually', 'up', 'providing', 'when', 'do', 'post', 'mortem', 'Man', 'House', 'can', 'decide', 'biggest', 'sin', 'screenplay', 'Robert', 'Ramsey', 'Matthew', 'am', 'not', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'John', 'J.', 'McLaughlin', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'better', 'use', 'Cedric', 'presence', 'more', 'fundamental', 'failure', 'punch', 'up', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'take', 'advantage', 'inherently', 'humorous', 'juxtaposition', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'bunch', 'University', 'Texas', 'Cheerleaders.Jones', 'Roland', 'Sharp', 'dedicated', 'humorless', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'marriage', 'alienated', 'daughter', 'job', 'life', 'only', 'thing', 'surprising', 'Sharp', 'partner', 'Rangers', 'woman', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'Sharp', 'talks', 'what', 'was', 'dinosaur', 'end', 'up', 'female', 'partner', 'then', 'government', 'witness', 'shot', 'right', 'Sharp', 'partner', 'wounded', 'Sharp', 'then', 'up', 'job', 'babysitting', 'five', 'Texas', 'cheerleaders', 'who', 'saw', 'murder', 'related', 'case', 'witness', 'was', 'going', 'testify', 'somebody', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'testified', 'cheerleaders', 'are', 'danger', 'believe', 'not', 'Sharp', 'going', 'keep', 'alive', 'pair', 'younger', 'Rangers', 'are', 'sent', 'street', 'house', 'cheerleaders', 'live', 'Sharp', 'job', 'mainly', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'being', 'ahead', 'game', 'well', 'enough', 'successfully', 'put', 'foot', 'down', 'What', 'chance', 'do', 'five', 'young', 'cheerleaders', 'have', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Not', 'much', 'can', 'tell', 'way', 'persuading', 'girls', 'wear', 'clothing', 'less', 'bodies', 'pragmatic', 'expensive', '.The', 'five', 'cheerleaders', 'are', 'played', 'Vanessa', 'Ferlito', 'Paula', 'Garc', 'eacute', 'Kelli', 'Garner', 'Monic', 'Keena', 'Christian', 'Millan', 'names', 'cheerleaders', 'are', 'Anne', 'Barb', 'Evie', 'Heather', 'Teresa', 'order', 'names', 'actresses', 'characters', 'are', 'provided', 'alphabetical', 'order', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'then', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'fully', 'developed', 'characters', 'just', 'fully', 'developed', 'cheerleaders', 'so', 'getting', 'confused', 'not', 'matter', 'much', 'can', 'distinguish', 'basis', 'hair', 'skin', 'color', 'more', 'can', 'shallow', 'personalities', 'e.g.', 'one', 'phone', 'sex', 'boyfriend', 'thinks', 'Sharp', 'cute', 'When', 'girls', 'find', 'out', 'Sharp', 'estranged', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'matters', 'more', 'fact', 'someone', 'trying', 'kill', 'Sharp', 'curtailing', 'liberties', 'course', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'something', 'course', 'going', 'put', 'position', 'be', 'killed.Although', 'people', 'do', 'get', 'killed', 'movie', 'threat', 'not', 'really', 'serious', 'so', 'when', 'cheerleaders', 'put', 'harms', 'way', 'supposed', 'be', 'comic', 'Sharp', 'given', 'love', 'interest', 'form', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Professor', 'Molly', 'McCarthy', 'up', 'cute', 'scene', 'where', 'girls', 'talk', 'Sharp', 'date', 'using', 'ear', 'piece', 'unfortunately', 'Archer', 'piece', 'furniture', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Percy', 'Stevens', 'ex-con', 'turned', 'preacher', 'who', 'up', 'periodically', 'provide', 'uninspired', 'comic', 'relief', 'fact', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'integral', 'story', 'distracted', 'bit', 'was', 'not', 'certain', 'why', 'was', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'anything', 'substantive', 'do.Apparently', 'Man', 'House', 'was', 'originally', 'entitled', 'Cheer', 'Up', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'ending', 'month', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'how', 'appealing', 'throw', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'bunch', 'cheerleaders', 'let', 'thaw', 'out', 'just', 'bit', 'so', 'can', 'show', 'more', 'emotional', 'depth', 'irritation', 'Actually', 'can', 'argue', 'best', 'rapport', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'pairing', 'Jones', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'Captain', 'Nichols', 'certainly', 'nice', 'pair', 'old', 'school', 'stone', 'where', 'blank', 'stare', 'as', 'good', 'raised', 'eyebrow', 'was', 'never', 'goal', 'make', 'anything', 'more', 'piece', 'fluff', 'still', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'come', 'up', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'fluff']",Man of the House

634891,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005JNT2,Only-A-Child,"[2, 5]","Months before its release, ""Man of the House"" was the subject of an extensive promotional campaign, it seemed like every visit to the theater included another opportunity to view its sexploitative trailer. Then a few weeks before the premiere the promotion stopped and the movie was released without fan-fair to a pared down list of theaters. Apparently some insightful person at the distribution company finally viewed the entire feature and figured out that the producers had failed to identify a target audience.Seemingly aimed at teenage boys and promoted as sexploitation, the film is actually far more chick-flick than titillation, comedy, or action adventure. And they wonder why these things lose money.Tommy Lee plays Roland, a Texas Ranger (a reprise of his character in ""The Fugitive""), who (big surprise) is not big on smiling or on emotional displays of any kind. Right under his nose a Texas mobster named John Cortland has the government witness Roland is guarding murdered, and Roland's female partner shot. This seems to irritate Roland, who hates people named John, as everybody knows. Lucky for Roland, five UT cheerleaders saw the murder. Because they're witnesses, they are in danger, so to protect them Roland moves into their house near campus. It is the best student housing I have ever seen but it serves to put Tommy Lee into close contact with the young females.Instead of the snotty cheerleader stereotype, each girl fits into her own movie stereotype- the Bad Girl (a cowgirl via Brooklyn), the Latina Firecracker (who speaks with the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel), the dumb blonde (who falls for Tommy Lee but loses out to her English Professor-insert ""Back to School"" here), the Brainiac blonde (who does little more than get her period and balance out the blonde quotient), and the token black girl (who would only be considered black in America and whose lines are limited to the philosophy of cheerleading). Kelli Garner as the dumb blonde is a pleasant surprise. Unlike Tommy Lee, none of the girls are demonstrably embarrassed to be in the film, despite being far less sexy that the actress who plays Tommy Lee's daughter.Predictably it is only a matter of time before Roland's grumpy exterior is worn down by his house-mate's perky charms. Unfortunately for action/adventure fans (or for those looking for a bit of suspense in their films), there is never any sense that the girls are in actual peril. At least in part because close examination of the premise reveals little or no logic to support the necessity of having them eliminated.While there isn't much to recommend ""Man of the House,"" there's no major reason to warn people off other than the horrible mismatch between content and target audience. It's no worse than half the movies that get made. But be prepared to fast-forward through the sequence where the girls give Tommy Lee a makeover.

And that lends a sense of credibility to this film's rather far-fetched plot of the Texas Rangers needing to protect five university cheerleaders who witnessed a murder...I think that only works out in certain fantasies.  Anyway, this film balances Mr. Jones' gruff demeaner (does he trademark that or something) with it's light-hearted humor and out-there antics.  While this work isn't deep or thought-provoking in any way, it is certainly hilarious and entertaining.  Also, the film's score is quite catchy and I've been unable to find a soundtrack recording out there (I'm not sure there is one, but I can dream...)  I will say that having the real-life Governor of Texas appearing in the film as himself does not make this plot any more credible.  In fact, the Governor relaying the protection assignment actually lowers the credibility for me no matter how connected the cheerleaders' fathers seem to be.  I will reccomend this to anyone looking for some light-hearted, funny entertainment with some action and a good score and a great leading man.

But instead, we are given stupid girls with no personality. Heck, even sterotypes fail us!

The formulaic plot is as follows:  A group of Texas Longhorn cheerleaders witness the mob execution of a witness wanted by the Texas Rangers, and thus they need protection in order to avoid becoming victims themselves.  Enter Tommy Lee Jones, who is forced to move into the girls' house on campus and babysit them for protection.  Predictable hilarity ensues, with plenty of culture clashes between the college girls and the crusty Jones.This movie is about as formulaic as you can get.  The plot holds no surprises whatsoever, the identity of the bad guy is obvious from the beginning, and the action scenes are workable but nothing spectacular.  Nevertheless Tommy Lee Jones manages to take an average movie and lift it up to the level of a great popcorn flick that will appeal to pretty much everyone.  Cedric the Entertainer also appears in the film as an ex-con minister who is also a former UT cheerleader, and his scenes are a lot of fun to watch.  Anne Archer appears in the film as a UT professor who becomes Tommy Lee's love interest, but her role is pretty minimal.All in all, this one is worth watching, if not exactly a blockbuster.

Granted, it won't win any awards, but it does a good job as a time suck with its standard fish out of water story and count them, five token hot chicks.The story follows Tommy Lee Jones as a Texas Ranger, not the kind that would know Derek Jeter as some of the girls think, who is protecting a group of cheerleaders from the University of Texas who have witnessed a murder that is linked to a high powered businessman.  The ladies he is protecting include the token hot chick from Undeclared as the brainy one with social anxieties, Vanessa Ferlito, who is on one of the CSI's, Omaha maybe, plays the tough as nails one but has all the deep thoughts not too mention the only one who could master the Texas accent, Paula Garces, who surprisingly is on the wrong side of thirty playing a college student, and Chistina Milian, best know for her singing career, well actually not really, both play the fiery Latina chick, not sure why they didn't just combine the characters.  The standout of the cheerleaders though was Kelli Garner as the boy, and man, crazy dumb blonde, who brought depth and heart to what could have been just your routine Jessica or Paris caricature.  Rounding out the cast was Cedric the Entertainer who's talents were somewhat wasted as the ex-con turned preacher.Most of the movie is pretty predictable with the girls helping Jones character get in touch with his feminine side including the prerequisite makeover montage.  And it's a given that they would help him out with his girl troubles including his estranged daughter and the professor of one of the girls.

634910,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JNT2,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 18]","If you're sitting in a theater, watching a ""comedy"" and you don't laugh, is it still a comedy?There are certain films you should be aware of. Films released during most of January and in late August/ early September. These are the slowest periods of the year and the studios tend to dump films that they don't think are any good. And all films produced by Revolution Studios. This company has only produced one film that might be considered `good' and that was Ridley Scott's ""Blackhawk Down"".Notice how I am artfully delaying my critique of ""Man of the House""?The trailer preceeding ""Man of the House""  was for ""XXX: State of the Union"", also produced by Revolution Studios. Don't even get me started on the fact that they made a sequel to ""XXX"". In the trailer, Samuel Jackson is featured prominently, but at the end of the trailer, his name isn't even listed. I suspect that he was overwhelmed by the money offered and underwhelmed by the final product and had his name removed.Apparently, Tommy Lee Jones couldn't have his name removed from ""man of the House"", the abysmal new `comedy' in which he appears in virtually every scene.It's a familiar premise. Stoic, uptight guy (Jones), in this case a Texas Ranger, is deposited in an environment that makes him uncomfortable. Jones has to protect a group of five cheerleaders at the University of Texas, Austin, who have witnessed a murder. The cheerleaders are all vain, dumb and try to lighten up Jones' character. You'll laugh your head off. Unfortunately, in ""House"", there is almost nothing, scratch that, there is nothing, to make you even remotely smile.This set-up has been used hundreds of times and is already a pretty tired concept, but the film is so dead upon arrival that almost no one even seems to have the energy to try to make it work. Jones walks through the role, virtually the same role he does in action films and thrillers, with the usual competence. This is also supposed to be the joke. Because we are so familiar with Jones from ""The Fugitive"" and other films as the no-nonsense, won't stop for anything lawman, we are supposed to laugh when we watch him dealing with five scantily clad college cheerleaders.The problem with this film lies in two areas: the tired premise, as already addressed, and the complete stereotypical nature of the cheerleader characters. They're obsessed with their bodies? They're promiscuous? They love to shop? They want to go out and party? Wow, that's original.Clearly, the filmmakers intended for some of the most tired elements of the film to ""liven things up"". Jones' character has a bad relationship with his daughter, who is approximately the same age as the hookers, er,  cheerleaders with a heart of gold that Jones' is charged to protect. What do you think will happen? Yep, that's right.Stephen Herek, the director, has created yet another truly terrible film. His previous efforts have included ""Holy Man"", starring Eddie Murphy, ""Rock Star"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston and ""Life or Something Like It"" starring Anjelina Jolie and Edward Burns. Let me amend my previous statement.There are certain films you should be aware of. Films released during most of January and in late August/ early September. All films produced by Revolution Studios.

634913,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNT2,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","One dead serious Texas Ranger played by Tommy Lee Jones must protect the five witnesses for the prosecution. And the five witnesses happen to be unruly and bubbly cheerleaders of the Texas University. The story sounds thin and weak, and actually it is much weaker than that of Whoopie Goldberg's hit movie `Sister Act,' but thanks to the dead-pan humor of Tommy Lee Jones, `Man of the House' manages to be an OK entertainment.From the not-so-great opening including one now stale `cow humiliation' gag, you know the film itself does not take itself seriously. The blend of actions and comedy does not go well, especially when we see embarrassed Cedric the Entertainer holding a very, very dirty cell phone in his hand, and some cardboard characters getting killed in the alley.The film gets better when it introduces the five cheerleaders. The dialogues exchanged between Tommy Lee Jones' Texas Ranger and the cheerleaders (who just want to have fun even after witnessing killing!) are not particularly witty, some based on the typical wrong idea that cheerleaders are not bright, but still work with Tommy Lee Jones' comic acting that could be seen in `Men in Black.' Actually, you mighty see no difference in two roles, one Roland Sharp Texas Ranger of this film and Agent K in `MIB.' I rememered Robert DeNiro who is virtually doing the same dead-serious comic turn since `Analyze This.'The cheerleaders you see here are intentionally stereotyped ones, so don't expect that Monica Keena, Kelli Garner, Christina Millian, Paula Garces, and Vanessa Ferlito do real cheerleading. They are there as eye-candy, and though one of them seems to adore Tommy Lee's character, the director seems to have chosen to just drop the theme. After all, when Tommy Lee Jones meets them, and another elder female character, professor of literature played Ann Archer, the film has nothing to do except for showing funny bits of comedy (like those of TV sitcoms) about the clashing egos between the man and the girls, which are certainly enjoyable to see, and some obligatory set-pieces that keeps the story moving, which ends with a predictable conclusion.The director is Stephen Herek, whose CV includes `The Might Ducks' Charlie Sheen's `The Three Musketeers' `Holy Man' and `Rock Star.' And don't forget `Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.' If you have seen any of these fairly entertaining, but otherwise undistinguished films, you know what you will see in `Man of the House.'

It is advertised here at Amazon as being 1.33:1.

NOT ACCEPTABLE! Any way after getting no help from Amazon nor the the store who had it on the aspect ratio, I took my business to another company and there the same movie show as being produced in both 1.33:1 and 2.40:1. I went back to Amazon and goHastings (the seller I always use because of their superb ratings and immediate refund if not happy policy) to explaine what I had found out about the double aspect ratios on the same disc to see if they could verify if it was true. Amazon dropped the ball by telling me to contact goHastings and goHastings dropped the ball by just saying they could not check for me but would refund if it wasn't what I wanted. That's why I use them. I tried again to go to the 'update product info' for the feature once I received it and found that it was indeed in both fullscreen 1.33:1 and widescreen 2.40:1 as described else where on line, but there was no way to accomplish this simply because their are no options for the correction and you can't leave any notes about this there so it is still wrong at Amazon.
