874782,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B0006VL1IS,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[6, 10]","This is nowhere near as bad as some of Seagals, more recent straight to video releases, and tries to be more script orientated for a change. That having been said, this is not brilliant either, and Seagal seems to be suffering from a bitter irony. Despite trying to change direction a little in his movies, with his advancing years, people hire his movies for one reason, martial arts action and fight scenes - and plenty of baddies as cannon fodder for Mr Seagal to dispatch with unencumbered tenacity. Making a thoughtful and at times plodding oriental gangster drama may be a good idea, but doesn't really fit the character he chooses to play here (which incidentally is the same character he ALWAYS plays). The only reason fans of Seagal and the genre in general tolerate long periods of dialogue and drama is BECAUSE there are fight scenes, which here are sadly in very short supply. Seagal plays a CIA agent (no surprise there) but other than a standard revenge / outnumbered good guy flick, he actually tries to build a reasonable, and credible story. As an American raised in Japan, he is street wise, and well known amongst the warring powers, and is called in after a local politician is murdered. The FBI suspect the Yakuza, the CIA are sniffing around under the auspices of Homeland Security (and as usual portrayed as untrustworthy and uneasy allies) with Seagal in the middle trying to resolve the whole situation. I found a lot of similarities between this movie and ""Black Rain"" with Michael Douglas released some years ago now, as we are immersed into the old school Yakuza meets young money orientated disrespectful Yakuza. Add then their collaboration with Chinese Tongs in an attempt to create an all powerful drugs cartel, and oust the old boys, and you have a good set up for a movie. Mr Seagal of course has a youthful and inexperienced partner to babysit, and old flame, now assigned to follow him, and a love interest (strangely misplaced)to deal with as he wanders around Tokyo in a full length black leather coat, and a brooding stare that could wilt a daisy at 100 yards. Sadly, two thirds through the picture the Director decides to revert to killing off all he holds dear detracting from the whole flavor of the story and turns it from a reasonable drama to a silly romp. It's strange to say that the all too few fight sequences are actually very well choregraphed, and much like Seagals earlier, and infinitely better movies, but there should have been a lot more to carry the viewers interest throughout the entire picture. This movie has had some pretty bad reviews, which is a little harsh, and although 3 stars may be a little generous, fans especially should find some enjoyment here. Renting first would probably be the best advice I could offer.

After a series of dung heaps, a couple years ago he came out with a great film 'Belly Of The Beast'.  Despite his tremendously out-of-shape body, obvious stunt doubles, and excessively nappy hair, the movie was great.  It got me excited about Lord Steven again.Then about a year ago 'Out Of Reach' was released.  I was super-excited.  Boy, was I horribly disappointed in that pile of doodie.  He had completely let himself go, didn't even bother dubbing his own lines, and his hair was even nappier than ever.I should have learned my lesson to never get excited over another Seagal flick.  But alas, once again I was lured in by the upcoming release of 'Into The Sun'.  I bought it the day it came out, came home and immediately it went into my DVD player.  An hour and a half later I wanted to beat myself up for having not just rented it.  Obviously I should have known better.The first few minutes of the film lulled me into a false sense of hope, Lord Steven seemed to have actually gotten in better shape than he's been in years and he gets to show off his proficiency in the Japanese language.  Other than that, there is nothing remotely redeeming about 'Into The Sun'.  The plot is muddled and ridiculous, the supporting cast is a joke, and the whole two fight scenes in the movie(clocking in at about two pathetic minutes combined)are a joke.  The climax is, well, completely anti-climatic.  This movie is a mess and one of the most boring films I've ever seen.The blame should be squarely placed on the director, who is some guy named mink(ohh, he must be super-important to not even capitalize his name).  The script wasn't great, but it was decent enough if it had been padded with some killer fight scenes, which is what you want in a Seagal flick.  The setup was generic, but it could've been a good, bloody, mindless action flick that satisfied.  Instead, we get another boring pile of mush.Total doodie.  Only rent this if you are a Lord Steven fan.

874785,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B0006VL1IS,buru buru piggu,"[5, 10]","There's a VERY good reason this movie got released straight to video. It's completely horrible and dated and reminds me of the era in movie-making where all the heros in kung fu/martial arts movies were white men. It just looks really silly now that so many Asian movies are coming to the US and seeing wider releases abroad.As horrible as this movie was, I couldn't stop watching it. For me, it was an unintended comedy. The idea that Steven Seagal's character is some kind of sword and martial arts expert supercop in Japan, being able to speak Japanese and knowing all the ins and outs of the japanese underworld is preposterous. The action sequences were horribly filmed and edited to make up for the fact that Seagal is something like in his 50's now and moves with the grace of a gorilla after a Thanksgiving dinner. His age really shows and his hair looks completely fake!I lived near Tokyo for 3 years, so many of the settings in this movie are familiar. A couple of the scenes take place in the famous Tsukiji fish market and smaller neighborhoods around Tokyo. It's amazing to me that the director let himself squander the location. I would've loved to see him make better use of the surroundings. On a linguistic note, Seagal's Japanese, while not terrible, isn't as good as it should. He speaks like an obvious foreigner, but acts like he knows what the hell's going on and everyone else treats him as a natural japanese speaker, as ludicrous as that is. That's not my problem with this film though.

Hunter is brought in to look into the murder of Tokyo's governor along with his new FBI partner Sean Mac (played by Vampire Diaries' Matthew Davis).

Hunter ends up sending Mac on a surveillance mission, but it ends up in disaster. As Hunter gets closer to the killers, Yakuza kills someone close to him, resulting in Hunter taking matters into his own hands.Despite from the incorrect CIA/FBI jargon, Into the Sun wasn't a bad action flick.

874787,A1GSNXORN62759,B0006VL1IS,David,"[3, 4]","Steven Segal writes, executive produces, and stars in ""Into the Sun.""  It is basically a film about the FBI's attempt to clean up terrorism by going after local gangsters in Tokyo that sell heroin by stuffing them into fish.  Doesn't that make sense??  There was also something else in there about a ""governor"" getting assassinated, which was basically a subplot that was quickly wrapped up by Segal walking onto the crime scene and saying ""get me some photos of this"" and then pointing up to the video surveillance camera.Anyway, Travis Hunter (Segal) spends the first half of the movie walking around finding places to eat and talking to Japanese gangsters about one particular thug, Kuroda (it's really action packed). On a side note, Kuroda has to be the worst villain ever in the history of cinema.  He makes the job easy for Hunter by basically killing half the people that work for him: he shoots one guy in the head, stabs another one, and threatens to shoot his second-in-command just because he feels a little fussy. Plus, he is a horrible sword fighter, which makes it easy for Travis Hunter - a ""master swordsman"" - to kill him.  (Why doesn't Kuroda just shoot Hunter?!)  Also, in the first half of the film, Hunter (Segal) is persistent on mocking us with his fluency in Japanese.  It is like he is saying, ""Ha ha! You might be laughing at my slicked back V-shaped hair and my giant head, but I know Japanese and you - foolish American - have to read the subtitles.""  The second half of the film becomes a revenge narrative where Segal really goes after Kuroda.  He kills him extra hard at the end.  There is also a really touching scene with Hunter's fianc&eacute;, a Japanese woman at least twenty years younger.  After he proposes, she cries, with tears gushing down her face, and tells Hunter: ""I will follow you anywhere."" And then she makes disgusting love with him.  I just want you to know Segal, you don't need her. You have us, your audience. It is us that will follow you anywhere.Anyway, the thing that really confused me was the title and the opening of the movie. This film opens with what apparently, in retrospect, seems like a scene from another movie of Steven's that was accidentally cut in.  It shows Travis Hunter doing surveillance on some guys in a jungle, the ""Golden Triangle, Myanmar Jungle"" to be exact.  Then the bad guys shoot at them.  His partner gets shot fifteen times on the chopper while they escape. And Hunter says these reassuring words: ""You're not going to die."" Then they fly ""into the sun,"" which probably explains the meaning to the title.  His partner never shows up again. So I guess he died.This film ends with a phone call from the FBI to Hunter (""We need you""), which I consider a threat by the FBI to make a sequel.",3,One of his best,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,2777,"['Steven', 'Segal', 'executive', 'produces', 'stars', 'Into', 'Sun', 'basically', 'film', 'FBI', 'attempt', 'clean', 'up', 'terrorism', 'going', 'local', 'gangsters', 'Tokyo', 'sell', 'heroin', 'stuffing', 'fish', ""n't"", 'that', 'make', 'sense', 'was', 'also', 'something', 'else', 'governor', 'getting', 'assassinated', 'was', 'basically', 'subplot', 'was', 'quickly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Segal', 'walking', 'crime', 'scene', 'saying', 'get', 'photos', 'then', 'pointing', 'up', 'video', 'surveillance', 'camera.Anyway', 'Travis', 'Hunter', 'Segal', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'walking', 'finding', 'places', 'eat', 'talking', 'Japanese', 'gangsters', 'one', 'particular', 'thug', 'Kuroda', 'really', 'action', 'packed', 'side', 'note', 'Kuroda', 'be', 'worst', 'villain', 'ever', 'history', 'cinema', 'job', 'easy', 'Hunter', 'basically', 'killing', 'people', 'work', 'one', 'guy', 'head', 'one', 'shoot', 'second-in-command', 'just', 'little', 'fussy', 'horrible', 'sword', 'fighter', 'easy', 'Travis', 'Hunter', 'master', 'swordsman', 'kill', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Kuroda', 'just', 'shoot', 'Hunter', 'Also', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Hunter', 'Segal', 'persistent', 'mocking', 'fluency', 'Japanese', 'saying', 'Ha', 'ha', 'might', 'be', 'laughing', 'slicked', 'back', 'V-shaped', 'hair', 'giant', 'head', 'know', 'Japanese', 'foolish', 'American', 'have', 'read', 'subtitles', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'revenge', 'narrative', 'where', 'Segal', 'really', 'Kuroda', 'extra', 'hard', 'end', 'also', 'really', 'touching', 'scene', 'Hunter', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'least', 'twenty', 'years', 'younger', 'tears', 'gushing', 'down', 'face', 'tells', 'Hunter', 'will', 'follow', 'anywhere', 'then', 'disgusting', 'love', 'just', 'want', 'know', 'Segal', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'audience', 'will', 'follow', 'anywhere.Anyway', 'thing', 'really', 'confused', 'was', 'title', 'opening', 'movie', 'film', 'what', 'apparently', 'retrospect', 'scene', 'movie', 'Steven', 'was', 'accidentally', 'cut', 'Travis', 'Hunter', 'doing', 'surveillance', 'guys', 'jungle', 'Golden', 'Triangle', 'Myanmar', 'Jungle', 'be', 'exact', 'Then', 'bad', 'guys', 'shoot', 'partner', 'shot', 'fifteen', 'times', 'chopper', 'escape', 'Hunter', 'reassuring', 'words', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'die', 'Then', 'fly', 'sun', 'probably', 'meaning', 'title', 'partner', 'never', 'up', 'again', 'guess', 'film', 'ends', 'phone', 'call', 'FBI', 'Hunter', 'need', 'consider', 'threat', 'FBI', 'make', 'sequel']",N/A

More than half the film's dialogue is in Japanese and the DVD does not have subtitles automatically burned into the screen. You have to turn them on, thus subtitling the English dialogue too. Of course, I only figured this out after watching the whole film and not understanding a single thing about it.Still, no subtitles can explain the utterly pointless opening scene that contributes nothing to the rest of the film or what purpose the FBI 'sidekick' character Sean (Matthew Davis) served or why he was killed for finding a severed pinkie which the bad guy clearly did not want as he chucked it in a bucket right away. Why was Seagal's girlfriend killed? What was the point in killing them if it didn't even motivate Seagal into actually doing something other than going from place to place asking questions, and getting answers, in Japanese. What was the main story? Why is he wearing an M-60 with grenade launcher on his back on the cover when it makes no appearance in the film? Who was that lady following Seagal around? My god, it's such a poorly written and poorly told story I can hardly believe it.I have liked none of Seagal's non-American movies of late. The Foriegner was one of the worst film's have ever seen. But this film does have strong production values, a more mainstream production team and a slightly cool final scene with bad guys getting chopped up and stuff but I still wouldn't recommend renting it, especially since the DVD is messed up and it's nowhere near as good as his older movies like Out for Justice or Under Siege 2.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound and some pretty heavy punches during the fight scenes.Note to non-cockneys.

And indeed, after its lame and predictable opening action sequence, I was ready to hit ""stop"" on the ole remote. I'm glad I didn't. INTO THE SUN is a surprisingly effective and entertaining film with an unusually Eastern sensibility. Not a masterpiece by any means, it's still a well-worth-watching B-movie with a surprisingly restrained performance by Steven Seagal.There's no need to ever explain who Seagal is playing in a film; he plays himself, or rather, the image he has of himself which he has been selling since the mid-late 80s: an enigmatic, lethal loner who has hung up his CIA gloves but inevitably gets dragged back into the world of violence and crime because of (fill in the blank). This flick is no different in that regard. After the afformentioned lame opening, CIA's showrunner in Japan, (William Atherton), brings Seagal out of the cold to investigate a suspected alliance which is forming between the Chinese Triads and a radical young faction of the Japanese Yakuza, which somehow threatens American national security. An obligatory buddy-partner from the FBI (Matthew Davis) is supplied, a nasty villain (Takao Osawa) emerges from the gunsmoke, Seagal's love-interest (Chikai Kuriyama, I think) gets menaced, and mayhem ensues. Not exactly original material here, but what makes INTO THE SUN different and fun is the angle from which the story is approached. Seagal, who has co-story credit, was raised in Japan, and the whole film has a distinctly Japanese sensibility; a lot of the dialogue, including Steven's, is in Japanese, and instead of tons of shooting and butt-kicking, we get a fairly complex plot somewhat reminiscent of BLACK RAIN, which is heavy on both Japanese and Yakuza culture and has much less gunplay than you might expect. Indeed, the climax of the film is carried out almost entirely with swords, and isn't nearly as one-sided as most Seagal fights tend to be. Either Steven is getting less egocentric in his old age, or he's lost too many steps to convincingly play invincible anymore; either way, it helps the film.Naturally the movie has flaws. The beginning is stupid, the editing and transitions are all very clumsy, and Seagal, who is now not only 60 years old but kind of fat, often looks silly and not scary dragging around in his dyed ponytail and floor-length black leather coat. What's worse, and as always, he lacks chemistry with almost everyone in the cast, most especially his girlfriend. A man with a natural intensity and legitimately masterful aikido ability, he has never been able to come off as likeable in any of his movies, or to display almost any range of emotion, and he once again fails the test here (albeit only narrowly, since his scenes with Davis are actually pretty funny.) Surprisingly, the movie's action itself is restrained, with most of it happening around Seagal and not to him, except in one humorous fight scene with some street punks (""You're not ready,"" he tells the hapless gangsta almost kindly after slapping him silly. ""Come back in ten years.""), and that may bore many people. But since the film's emphasis is really more on the Yakuza culture, I actually consider this a strength, because that culture is fascinating. Indeed, the best thing about INTO THE SUN is probably Osawa, who as a psychopathically violent young Yakuza lord clearly influenced by American street culture, is a very entertaining villain and gives both Seagal and his old-school rivals in the Yakuza, a good run for their yen.INTO THE SUN has very low ratings on Amazon, but I have to disagree and give it four stars - not because it's a four star movie, but because it so completely exceeded my expectations. I rate it as a fun little str8-to-DVD that takes the Steven Seagal convention and aikido-throws it nicely on its ear.",3,Surprisingly Not Bad (3.5 stars),1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,3877,"['watched', 'film', 'whim', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'low', 'expectations', 'indeed', 'lame', 'predictable', 'opening', 'action', 'sequence', 'was', 'ready', 'hit', 'stop', 'ole', 'remote', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'INTO', 'SUN', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'entertaining', 'film', 'unusually', 'Eastern', 'sensibility', 'Not', 'masterpiece', 'means', 'still', 'well-worth-watching', 'B-movie', 'surprisingly', 'restrained', 'performance', 'Steven', 'Seagal.There', 'need', 'ever', 'explain', 'who', 'Seagal', 'playing', 'film', 'rather', 'image', 'been', 'selling', 'mid-late', '80s', 'enigmatic', 'lethal', 'loner', 'who', 'hung', 'up', 'CIA', 'gloves', 'inevitably', 'dragged', 'back', 'world', 'violence', 'crime', 'fill', 'blank', 'flick', 'different', 'regard', 'afformentioned', 'lame', 'opening', 'CIA', 'showrunner', 'Japan', 'William', 'Atherton', 'Seagal', 'cold', 'investigate', 'suspected', 'alliance', 'forming', 'Chinese', 'Triads', 'radical', 'young', 'faction', 'Japanese', 'Yakuza', 'somehow', 'threatens', 'American', 'national', 'security', 'obligatory', 'buddy-partner', 'FBI', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'supplied', 'nasty', 'villain', 'Takao', 'Osawa', 'gunsmoke', 'Seagal', 'love-interest', 'Chikai', 'Kuriyama', 'think', 'menaced', 'mayhem', 'ensues', 'Not', 'exactly', 'original', 'material', 'here', 'what', 'INTO', 'THE', 'SUN', 'different', 'fun', 'angle', 'story', 'approached', 'Seagal', 'who', 'co-story', 'credit', 'was', 'raised', 'Japan', 'whole', 'film', 'distinctly', 'Japanese', 'sensibility', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'including', 'Steven', 'Japanese', 'instead', 'tons', 'shooting', 'butt-kicking', 'get', 'fairly', 'complex', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'BLACK', 'RAIN', 'heavy', 'Japanese', 'Yakuza', 'culture', 'much', 'less', 'gunplay', 'might', 'expect', 'Indeed', 'climax', 'film', 'carried', 'almost', 'entirely', 'swords', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'one-sided', 'most', 'Seagal', 'fights', 'tend', 'be', 'Steven', 'getting', 'less', 'egocentric', 'old', 'age', 'lost', 'too', 'many', 'steps', 'convincingly', 'play', 'invincible', 'anymore', 'way', 'film.Naturally', 'movie', 'flaws', 'beginning', 'stupid', 'editing', 'transitions', 'are', 'very', 'clumsy', 'Seagal', 'who', 'now', 'not', 'only', '60', 'years', 'old', 'kind', 'fat', 'often', 'silly', 'not', 'scary', 'dragging', 'around', 'dyed', 'ponytail', 'floor-length', 'black', 'leather', 'coat', 'What', 'worse', 'always', 'chemistry', 'almost', 'everyone', 'cast', 'most', 'especially', 'girlfriend', 'man', 'natural', 'intensity', 'legitimately', 'masterful', 'aikido', 'ability', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'come', 'off', 'likeable', 'movies', 'display', 'almost', 'range', 'emotion', 'once', 'again', 'test', 'here', 'only', 'narrowly', 'scenes', 'Davis', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Surprisingly', 'movie', 'action', 'restrained', 'most', 'happening', 'Seagal', 'not', 'one', 'humorous', 'fight', 'scene', 'street', 'punks', ""'re"", 'not', 'ready', 'hapless', 'gangsta', 'almost', 'kindly', 'slapping', 'silly', 'Come', 'back', 'ten', 'years', 'may', 'bore', 'many', 'people', 'film', 'emphasis', 'really', 'more', 'Yakuza', 'culture', 'actually', 'consider', 'strength', 'culture', 'fascinating', 'Indeed', 'best', 'thing', 'INTO', 'THE', 'SUN', 'probably', 'Osawa', 'who', 'psychopathically', 'violent', 'young', 'Yakuza', 'lord', 'clearly', 'influenced', 'American', 'street', 'culture', 'very', 'entertaining', 'villain', 'Seagal', 'old-school', 'rivals', 'Yakuza', 'good', 'run', 'yen.INTO', 'THE', 'SUN', 'very', 'low', 'ratings', 'Amazon', 'have', 'disagree', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'not', 'four', 'star', 'movie', 'so', 'completely', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'rate', 'fun', 'little', 'str8-to-DVD', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'convention', 'aikido-throws', 'nicely', 'ear']",N/A

874799,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B0006VL1IS,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","I wrote a previous review for this film a while ago, but time had dated it and it no longer expressed how I felt about the movie - specifically, that I consider it one of the best of Steven Seagal's direct-to-video era. Perhaps because it's bookended between particularly questionable flicks from the Buddhist Bonecrusher's filmography, this one stands out for its energy and aestheticism. While it's definitely not without flaws, it still feels special as far as ol' Steven is concerned: whereas other flicks from this time in his career feel like things he *had* to do for one reason or another, this one seems like more of a pet project he's excited about, and the ambition of the production makes it seem like something he should have tackled during his theatrical days. Does this one belong in a theater? - no, but it definitely belongs in the library of genuine fans.The story: an ex-CIA agent (Seagal) is sent to investigate the assassination of a Tokyo governor, whereupon he learns of a deadly underworld scheme involving the merging of Japanese and Chinese mafia forces.The film's biggest fault is its plot, which could definitely use some streamlining. While it's not as bad as something likeThe Foreignerwherein you have no earthly idea why anybody is doing the things they are, this one's story features a couple areas of convolution (notably the romance of Seagal's character) as well as a few worthless but no less prominent characters. The most conspicuous of these is the sidekick played by Matthew Davis (Tigerland), who is given all the makings of a main player but contributes nothing (SPOILER) before being killed halfway through the film. Nevertheless, both the story and the overall cast remain above-average for a Seagal production. There's some actual intrigue here and, again, it's one of the few films of the time that Steven seems to be genuinely excited about. Maybe it's because he's getting to work with some good co-stars: along with Matthew Davis, there's Takao Osawa (Goemon) and the legendary Ken Lo (The Legend of Drunken Master) as the main villains, and the immediate supporting players include William Atherton (Die Hard), Akira Terao (Ran), and Kosuke Toyohara (Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah) -not the most recognizable cast Seagal's worked with, but certainly one of the most colorful.Speaking of color, that's one of the things I like most about the picture: after so many grey-looking films shot in eastern Europe, these bright, flashy, and quaint Japanese locales are a breath of fresh air. Filmed on-location, it really looks like Japan and not some designer's rendering. What's more, it's nice to hear so much Japanese being spoken, by the co-stars as well as Seagal himself. Admittedly, some of the lines are truly strange (""This one is so sharp. I'll use it tonight. This kills very well""), but they're still entertaining to listen to. Of course, actions speak louder than any words in Seagal's films, and definitely one of the best things about the picture is its action content. There could definitely be more of it, but it's all pretty decent stuff. From what I can recall, Seagal only utilizes a stunt double once in the film (to perform an actual stunt), which in itself is another breath of fresh air. I'll admit that his showdown with Ken Lo could have and should have been better (i.e. showier, lengthier), but it's nevertheless one of the few one-on-one fights that Steven's character doesn't entirely dominate. The centerpiece, however, is a massive swordfight that pays more than a bit of homage toKill Bill. It's pretty grounded and probably not the best you'll have ever seen, but it's still a complete change of style and pace for Seagal, who shows his kendo skills to their fullest and bloodiest extent.The film's strong points are somewhat undermined by how the script panders and indulges Seagal, and this could be enough to deter the average viewer. Fans will be less bothered by this, I hope, and be able to watch the movie for its strengths rather than its weaknesses.",4,"""I'm going right through the front door""",1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,4033,"['wrote', 'previous', 'review', 'film', 'while', 'ago', 'time', 'had', 'dated', 'no', 'longer', 'expressed', 'how', 'felt', 'movie', 'specifically', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'direct-to-video', 'era', 'Perhaps', 'bookended', 'particularly', 'questionable', 'flicks', 'Buddhist', 'Bonecrusher', 'filmography', 'one', 'out', 'energy', 'aestheticism', 'definitely', 'not', 'flaws', 'still', 'special', 'as', 'far', 'ol', 'Steven', 'concerned', 'other', 'flicks', 'time', 'career', 'feel', 'things', 'do', 'one', 'reason', 'one', 'more', 'pet', 'project', 'excited', 'ambition', 'production', 'seem', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'tackled', 'theatrical', 'days', 'one', 'belong', 'theater', 'definitely', 'library', 'genuine', 'fans.The', 'story', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'Seagal', 'sent', 'investigate', 'assassination', 'Tokyo', 'governor', 'deadly', 'underworld', 'scheme', 'involving', 'merging', 'Japanese', 'Chinese', 'mafia', 'forces.The', 'film', 'biggest', 'fault', 'plot', 'could', 'definitely', 'use', 'streamlining', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'something', 'likeThe', 'Foreignerwherein', 'have', 'earthly', 'idea', 'why', 'anybody', 'doing', 'things', 'are', 'one', 'story', 'couple', 'areas', 'convolution', 'notably', 'romance', 'Seagal', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'worthless', 'less', 'prominent', 'characters', 'most', 'conspicuous', 'sidekick', 'played', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'Tigerland', 'who', 'given', 'makings', 'main', 'player', 'nothing', 'SPOILER', 'being', 'killed', 'halfway', 'film', 'Nevertheless', 'story', 'overall', 'cast', 'remain', 'above-average', 'Seagal', 'production', 'actual', 'intrigue', 'here', 'again', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'time', 'Steven', 'be', 'genuinely', 'excited', 'Maybe', 'getting', 'work', 'good', 'co-stars', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'Takao', 'Osawa', 'Goemon', 'legendary', 'Ken', 'Lo', 'Legend', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'main', 'villains', 'immediate', 'supporting', 'players', 'include', 'William', 'Atherton', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Akira', 'Terao', 'Ran', 'Kosuke', 'Toyohara', 'Godzilla', 'King', 'Ghidorah', '-not', 'most', 'recognizable', 'cast', 'Seagal', 'worked', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'colorful.Speaking', 'color', 'one', 'things', 'like', 'most', 'picture', 'so', 'many', 'grey-looking', 'films', 'shot', 'eastern', 'Europe', 'bright', 'flashy', 'quaint', 'Japanese', 'locales', 'are', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Filmed', 'on-location', 'really', 'Japan', 'not', 'designer', 'rendering', 'What', 'more', 'nice', 'hear', 'so', 'much', 'Japanese', 'being', 'spoken', 'co-stars', 'as', 'well', 'Seagal', 'Admittedly', 'lines', 'are', 'truly', 'strange', 'one', 'so', 'sharp', ""'ll"", 'use', 'tonight', 'very', 'well', ""'re"", 'still', 'entertaining', 'listen', 'course', 'actions', 'speak', 'louder', 'words', 'Seagal', 'films', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'picture', 'action', 'content', 'could', 'definitely', 'be', 'more', 'pretty', 'decent', 'stuff', 'what', 'can', 'recall', 'Seagal', 'only', 'stunt', 'double', 'once', 'film', 'perform', 'actual', 'stunt', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'showdown', 'Ken', 'Lo', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'i.e', 'showier', 'lengthier', 'nevertheless', 'one', 'few', 'one-on-one', 'fights', 'Steven', 'character', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'dominate', 'centerpiece', 'however', 'massive', 'swordfight', 'more', 'bit', 'homage', 'toKill', 'Bill', 'pretty', 'grounded', 'probably', 'not', 'best', ""'ll"", 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'still', 'complete', 'change', 'style', 'pace', 'Seagal', 'who', 'kendo', 'skills', 'fullest', 'bloodiest', 'extent.The', 'film', 'strong', 'points', 'are', 'somewhat', 'undermined', 'how', 'script', 'panders', 'indulges', 'Seagal', 'could', 'be', 'enough', 'deter', 'average', 'viewer', 'Fans', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'bothered', 'hope', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'movie', 'strengths', 'rather', 'weaknesses']",N/A

For an hour of Into The Sun we watch Seagal drive around Tokyo talking to various people he has known over the years and that's really all there is to this until the last 20 minutes. Seagal again has a hand in writing this and the script is just bad and really takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie. What is with Seagal bedding very very! young Asian girls in all his movies lately.He is doubled in about 80 percent of all external shots of his character walking to locations and entering buildings.  I don't mind Seagal doing movies that are more thrillers than action movies now that he is getting on in years and I'd even welcome the change if they were written with believability, simple plots and good production values and some well staged action set pieces, be it gun play or martial arts. I'm more disappointed  with Into The Sun because I really wanted to enjoy it and thought it looked like the one to help Seagal get back to mainstream directors who know what they are doing behind a camera. I bought this without renting it first based on reviews posted here obviously by blinded fanatical fans of Seagal who can not seem to be objective regarding the quality of Seagals movie releases.

874802,ANZUZTIBMGK4S,B0006VL1IS,"Poe the Ghost ""George""","[6, 7]","This is the first Steven Seagal movie I've ever seen, I bought it at Kmart for 5 dollars on sale. Normally, I wouldn't have bought this movie, but I was in the mood for an action movie (cheesy or otherwise) and for only 5 bucks it seemed like a good buy.After reading the reviews and watching the movie, I must say that I don't have the buyer's remorse. It wasn't the best action movie I've ever seen, but it's a far cry from being the worst.Although it was direct to video here in the states, it did show up in theaters abroad, and it's not low budget either. It's filmed rather well, has an okay story, and the acting is good.While the villans in this movie are all overly cliched Japanesse Mob bosses and henchmen, and it doesn't really fit that Travis Hunter (Steven Seagal) seems to know everything about the Japanesse underworld even though he did grow up in Japan, the movie flows pretty well and (although a little sad) had a good ending.Maybe it's just because this is the first Steven Seagal movie I've ever seen, so I can't compare it to his other movies, but I liked this movie, and I don't regret buying it. Heck, I can even see myself watching it again...Now let's talk about the rating...I usually don't agree with the MPAA's ratings, namely because they're always a bit off in my opinion. Yes, this movie is rated R and that is a proper rating due to the ammount of swearing & violence. However, on the back of the box, it also mentions nudity and sexual situations, which aren't that prevalant... It should've said ""brief partial nudity"" due to the fact that the only nudity you actually see depicts 2 women swimming topless in an oversized fish tank at a club, some 50 feet away from the camera for about 10 seconds.Also, there's only one sex scene, and it's down right mild compared to the scenes you'd see in other R rated movies. Honestly, it's about 7 seconds long, showing Hunter and his fiancee kissing each other, then it shows the sun rise outside of their house, them waking up together, then it jumps to another scene.The violence, while there aren't alot of fight scenes in this movie, is still enough for it to merit an R rating. And the F*** word is spoken many times throughout the movie.Pros: A good action movie, can be a little corny at times, but still good.Good acting.Well coriographed fighting sequences.Good musical score for the most part.While the story & villans are slightly generic, you won't find yourself saying, ""It's been done.""Cons: Camera has been sped up slightly to make the action appear more exciting, but it doesn't work...The main bag guy, Kurado, is WAY too overly cliched. A young, arrogant, overly aggressive man, who makes Hunter's job alot easier by killing most of his own men!Why does hunter know everything about the Japanesse underworld? I'm an Italian-American, and I don't know anything about the American underworld except for what I've seen in the movies...On the cover, it shows Hunter walking away from an exploding area with a grenade launcher strapped to his back. (neither of which appear in the movie... No explotions, no grenade launcher.)Overall, I think this movie was judged unfairly by others... Although it's no 5 star blockbuster, this is a decent action movie in my opinion, and worth the cheap price they're asking for it if you're in the mood for an action movie.Overall rating: 3.8 Stars",3,Judged unfairly by most...,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,3374,"['first', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'bought', 'Kmart', '5', 'dollars', 'sale', 'Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'movie', 'was', 'mood', 'action', 'movie', 'cheesy', 'otherwise', 'only', '5', 'bucks', 'seemed', 'good', 'buy.After', 'reading', 'reviews', 'watching', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'buyer', 'remorse', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'action', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'far', 'cry', 'being', 'worst.Although', 'was', 'direct', 'video', 'here', 'states', 'did', 'show', 'up', 'theaters', 'abroad', 'not', 'low', 'budget', 'filmed', 'rather', 'well', 'okay', 'story', 'acting', 'villans', 'movie', 'are', 'overly', 'cliched', 'Japanesse', 'Mob', 'bosses', 'henchmen', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'Travis', 'Hunter', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'know', 'everything', 'Japanesse', 'underworld', 'even', 'did', 'grow', 'up', 'Japan', 'movie', 'pretty', 'well', 'little', 'sad', 'had', 'good', 'ending.Maybe', 'just', 'first', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'other', 'movies', 'liked', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'buying', 'Heck', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'watching', 'again', 'Now', 'let', 'talk', 'rating', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'MPAA', 'ratings', 'namely', ""'re"", 'always', 'bit', 'opinion', 'Yes', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'proper', 'rating', 'due', 'ammount', 'swearing', 'violence', 'However', 'back', 'box', 'also', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'are', ""n't"", 'prevalant', 'should', ""'ve"", 'said', 'brief', 'partial', 'nudity', 'due', 'fact', 'only', 'nudity', 'actually', 'see', 'depicts', '2', 'women', 'swimming', 'topless', 'oversized', 'fish', 'tank', 'club', '50', 'feet', 'away', 'camera', '10', 'seconds.Also', 'only', 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'down', 'right', 'mild', 'compared', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'see', 'other', 'R', 'rated', 'movies', 'Honestly', '7', 'seconds', 'long', 'showing', 'Hunter', 'fiancee', 'kissing', 'other', 'then', 'sun', 'rise', 'house', 'waking', 'up', 'together', 'then', 'scene.The', 'violence', 'are', ""n't"", 'alot', 'fight', 'scenes', 'movie', 'still', 'enough', 'merit', 'R', 'rating', 'F***', 'word', 'spoken', 'many', 'times', 'movie.Pros', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'corny', 'times', 'still', 'good.Good', 'acting.Well', 'coriographed', 'fighting', 'sequences.Good', 'musical', 'score', 'most', 'story', 'villans', 'are', 'slightly', 'generic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'saying', 'been', 'done', 'Cons', 'Camera', 'been', 'sped', 'up', 'slightly', 'make', 'action', 'appear', 'more', 'exciting', ""n't"", 'work', 'main', 'bag', 'guy', 'Kurado', 'WAY', 'too', 'overly', 'cliched', 'young', 'arrogant', 'overly', 'aggressive', 'man', 'who', 'Hunter', 'job', 'alot', 'easier', 'killing', 'most', 'own', 'men', 'Why', 'hunter', 'know', 'everything', 'Japanesse', 'underworld', ""'m"", 'Italian-American', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'American', 'underworld', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'cover', 'Hunter', 'walking', 'away', 'exploding', 'area', 'grenade', 'launcher', 'strapped', 'back', 'appear', 'movie', 'explotions', 'grenade', 'launcher', 'Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'judged', 'unfairly', 'others', '5', 'star', 'blockbuster', 'decent', 'action', 'movie', 'opinion', 'cheap', 'price', ""'re"", 'asking', ""'re"", 'mood', 'action', 'movie.Overall', 'rating', '3.8', 'Stars']",N/A

874806,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B0006VL1IS,Sid the Elf,"[5, 7]","When it comes to a Steven Seagal film it can typically go one of two ways; either it blows beyond belief or it's so hilarious that we reference it for years to come. Into the Sun appeared to be extremely dull due to many reviews which forced us to keep it on the back burner into our no priority bin. When it came on tv this afternoon we figured this was the opportune time to finally see for ourselves, and we were very surprised. This movie was actually good yet hilarious at the same time. We were graced with Seagals legendary ponytail as it was at the end of it's career before a luscious head of Myers hair took over. This was one of the last films it could be seen in so that was a big star there.Our hefty, leather trench coat sporting friend Seagal plays his usual destructive character as he tears through Japan with brute force. His name is Travis and returns to his Japan, where he was raised which confirms the Seagal being Dutch's dad theory, to bring down a drug ring one Chinaman at a time. Yeah it's been done a million times but never seems to get old. Naturally he rips through everyone using his sped up fighting action and a nice sword (2nd Dutch confirmation). The final scene is one to remember as limbs are loped off in record timing.We were very pleased with this entry into the long obese list of Seagal flicks, and wonder why more didn't enjoy it. You could actually understand what he was saying as opposed to the inaudible dialogue with the stuff he puts out now. He evens speak some Japanese throughout the movie which is almost as hilarious as his Russian accent in Driven to Kill (review will be up this week).

The last bunch of direct to video movies he did are seriously lacking.  His ""classic"" films of the late 80s/early 90s were silly of course, but were fun.  Now his films are just boring...really boring.  I always knew Seagal could make a dumb movie, but not a boring one, let alone a long string of boring ones.  Hell, I might just give up at this point.  Plus you have to be suspicious of a film directed by someone calling themselves Mink.  I'd think if you're gonna be referring to yourself by a single name, you'd better be cool enough to back it up.  I don't recall any classic contributions to the film world from Mink, nor do I think we'll ever see any.  And I really don't think Into The Sun is gonna make Mink a director to study in film class.  Into The Sun has Seagal as a CIA agent living in Japan who's called upon to look into the assassination of a political figure.  He finds that there's a new generation of Yakuza who are joining forces with the Chinese Tongs and.....oh, hell, who really cares?  When have we ever cared about the plot of a Steven Seagal movie as long as he delivered the goods?  Well, this time the plot is still irrelevant and he doesn't deliver the goods.  Most of the film he wanders around Japan investigating the case.  He talks to all these high profile Japanese figures who all seem to have the upmost respect for him.  I don't know why, but it always bugged me when Seagal tries so hard in his films to be Japanese.  He goes around speaking Japanese, and seems right at home with all customs and rituals.  I've always found this annoying and silly with Seagal, coz I'm sure the Japanese probably hate the guy.  Now I know Seagal is the first white guy to establish a martial arts school in Japan, so I know he actually is somewhat of the Real McCoy, but it still annoys me regardless coz it just seems so phony.  There are a couple of fight scenes that go by rather quick, and they do look better than some of the fight scenes from his recent films.  Some decent swordwork too, but it's just too little too late.  Seagal, like usual, is totally sleepwalking through the film, even moreso that usual, but he can still woo the chick at least!  Seagal highlights in this one include Steve ramming a guy's head into a soda machine as cans of soda come falling out, and stabbing a guy in the neck with a pair of chopsticks.

874810,A3863M2049OPN3,B0006VL1IS,The Bus,"[37, 45]","I've seen every seagal movie. I've loved some, I've hated more. I wasn't going to rent this one because first reviews in seemes like it was pretty bad, but because I have my movie pass at blockbuster, and because since the stupid no more late fees thing there's like no movies to rent in stock anymore, I decided to try it. Turns out, it was actually ok. It wasn't great. As some other people mentioned there weren't a lot of fight scenes, but there were quite a few, some very reminiscient of out for justice.The plot was fragmented, it was like the writers took an idea for a story, broke it down into a dozen seperate parts, wrote them on a piece of paper, tore the paper up into little pieces and put them in a box. Then somebody randomly pulled out pieces of the story and that's the order they decided to shoot it in. A LOT of it didn't flow very well, and a LOT of it didn't really make sense, you were like ""huh"" a lot of the time. Just like every seagal movie, they had to somehow squeeze in a story involving a love interest, a past CIA mission, Yakuza AND Tong (there's always an organized crime link), lots of shooting, a new rookie partnet, somebody close always gets killed, AND for some reason swordfighting.And at least it appeared that he read all his lines in this one. It was an enjoyable movie, worth renting, but probably not worth buying unless you're a die hard seagal fan. I suppose if you weren't a fan, you probably wouldn't even be reading this anyways. I don't think you'll be disapointed, of course, you also won't be impressed!

874811,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006VL1IS,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","So what do you think of this? `Out of Reach' 'Into the Sun' 'Submerged' `Today You Die.' They are the list of recent Seven Seagal films. Don't they sound like a message or warning from the Heaven to the star of these films? Well, anyway, I really hope that Seagal is aware of his career decline that really coming to the end very fast.`Into the Sun' has one interesting thing, and that is the location of Japan. Considerable amounts of the film are, I think, shot somewhere outside Japan (like the inside shots of the Yakuza's office), but the unique urban feeling of Tokyo should be called one of the merits of the film. Unfortunately, neither director Mink nor Seagal seems to realize that, wasting every chance to make the film more original in whatever way they want. (By the way, this film was released theatrically in Japan on November 26, 2005, in more than 90 theaters all over the country. Can you believe that?)Anyway, the film starts with the assassination of the Governor of Tokyo Prefecture, whose aggressive views on foreigners are causing controversy. (And here, you can see a ten-second cameo of Chiaki Kuriyama, `Go-go Yubari' in `Kill Bill Vol.1'.) The governor's inclusion is a nice touch for his outspoken portrait suggests the real governor Mr. Ishihara, who is equally outspoken.But everything goes down from there. I don't know why, but one CIA agent Travis (Steven Seagal) is called in to investigate the case with FBI (why?) agent (Matthew Davis), by another CIA agent and Travis's acquaintance William Atherton. Before you say `CIA agent, not again!' listen, the story/script is co-written by Steven Seagal himself. No Japanese police would interfere with their jobs, because none of them appears. Even though the governor of the prefecture (of which population easily exceeds 10 million) is gunned down, the police in Japan is not needed.Instead of Japanese police, Yakuza step in. Actually, as you see, it is one of the young ambitious Yakuza Kuroda (Takao Osawa) that is responsible for the attack, and Yakuza of older generation don't like it, especially ... but wait, where does Seagal fit in? Oh, don't worry, what he does is simple. He goes where he should go (I don't know how, but he knows the right person), and he kills whoever attacks him, or whoever looks very bad, using swords and, if he likes, chopsticks. And romance? There is one, and Seagal's Travis and his love talk about love in a Japanese-style garden in a very childish way.The story makes no sense, but it's OK as long as the actions are reasonable. Are they reasonable? Admittedly, considering the film's B-movie status, the actions as a whole are better than some of the previous films of his. They are what you call `just OK,' but as you see, he is no longer the Seagal in the 80s, when he could display the real martial arts with authentic touch. Again, his actions here are helped by fast and quick editing.Some of the Japanese actors are respected veterans such as Masato Ibu (who plays the older Yakuza boss) and Akira Terao (playing a tycoon of big company). Their acting is more than decent, that of the professional actors.Just in case you're interested in trivia, here's a brief note about the film. You can see the clip of one `Gamera' film, in which the face of Seagal's real-life daughter Ayako Fujitani can be seen briefly on the TV twice in Yakuza's room. And you can hear the voice of Seagal at the end credit song `Don't You Cry' co-written by Seagal ... again.So, is he getting better? I don't think so, and probably I think he missed the last train to leave the direct-to-video land where he got stuck for a long time. What he needs is better action or commercially viable support (like DMX), definitely not singing.",2,Stuck in B Action Fomula: Seagal in Tokyo Still Needs Better Script and Above All Better Actions,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,3737,"['So', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'Reach', 'Sun', ""'Submerged"", 'Today', 'Die', 'are', 'list', 'recent', 'Seven', 'Seagal', 'films', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'message', 'warning', 'Heaven', 'star', 'films', 'Well', 'anyway', 'really', 'hope', 'Seagal', 'aware', 'career', 'decline', 'really', 'coming', 'end', 'very', 'fast.', 'Sun', 'one', 'interesting', 'thing', 'location', 'Japan', 'Considerable', 'amounts', 'film', 'are', 'think', 'shot', 'somewhere', 'Japan', 'inside', 'shots', 'Yakuza', 'office', 'unique', 'urban', 'feeling', 'Tokyo', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'one', 'merits', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'Mink', 'Seagal', 'realize', 'wasting', 'chance', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'original', 'way', 'want', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'Japan', 'November', '26', '2005', 'more', '90', 'theaters', 'country', 'Can', 'believe', 'Anyway', 'film', 'assassination', 'Governor', 'Tokyo', 'Prefecture', 'aggressive', 'views', 'foreigners', 'are', 'causing', 'controversy', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'ten-second', 'cameo', 'Chiaki', 'Kuriyama', 'Go-go', 'Yubari', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Vol.1', 'governor', 'inclusion', 'nice', 'touch', 'outspoken', 'portrait', 'real', 'governor', 'Mr.', 'Ishihara', 'who', 'equally', 'outspoken.But', 'everything', 'down', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'one', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Travis', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'called', 'investigate', 'case', 'FBI', 'why', 'agent', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Travis', 'acquaintance', 'William', 'Atherton', 'say', 'CIA', 'agent', 'not', 'again', 'listen', 'story/script', 'co-written', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'No', 'Japanese', 'police', 'would', 'interfere', 'jobs', 'none', 'Even', 'governor', 'prefecture', 'population', 'easily', '10', 'million', 'gunned', 'down', 'police', 'Japan', 'not', 'needed.Instead', 'Japanese', 'police', 'Yakuza', 'step', 'Actually', 'see', 'one', 'young', 'ambitious', 'Yakuza', 'Kuroda', 'Takao', 'Osawa', 'responsible', 'attack', 'Yakuza', 'older', 'generation', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'especially', 'wait', 'where', 'Seagal', 'fit', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'what', 'simple', 'where', 'should', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'right', 'person', 'whoever', 'very', 'bad', 'using', 'swords', 'chopsticks', 'romance', 'one', 'Seagal', 'Travis', 'love', 'talk', 'love', 'Japanese-style', 'garden', 'very', 'childish', 'way.The', 'story', 'sense', 'OK', 'as', 'long', 'actions', 'are', 'reasonable', 'Are', 'reasonable', 'Admittedly', 'considering', 'film', 'B-movie', 'status', 'actions', 'whole', 'are', 'better', 'previous', 'films', 'are', 'what', 'call', 'just', 'OK', 'see', 'no', 'longer', 'Seagal', '80s', 'when', 'could', 'display', 'real', 'martial', 'arts', 'authentic', 'touch', 'Again', 'actions', 'here', 'are', 'helped', 'fast', 'quick', 'editing.Some', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'are', 'respected', 'veterans', 'such', 'Masato', 'Ibu', 'who', 'older', 'Yakuza', 'boss', 'Akira', 'Terao', 'playing', 'tycoon', 'big', 'company', 'acting', 'more', 'decent', 'professional', 'actors.Just', 'case', ""'re"", 'interested', 'trivia', 'here', 'brief', 'note', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'clip', 'one', 'Gamera', 'film', 'face', 'Seagal', 'real-life', 'daughter', 'Ayako', 'Fujitani', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'briefly', 'TV', 'twice', 'Yakuza', 'room', 'can', 'hear', 'voice', 'Seagal', 'end', 'credit', 'song', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'co-written', 'Seagal', 'again.So', 'getting', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'probably', 'think', 'missed', 'last', 'train', 'leave', 'direct-to-video', 'land', 'where', 'got', 'stuck', 'long', 'time', 'What', 'better', 'action', 'commercially', 'viable', 'support', 'DMX', 'definitely', 'not', 'singing']",N/A
