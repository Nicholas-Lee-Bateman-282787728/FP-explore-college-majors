John Wayne is fine but a poor script and overall mawkishness make for poor film making from a once brilliant director.  Visually flat, it has none of the compositional virtuosity of his 30s and 40s films, and feels like a cheap tv production. I bought it to fill a gap in my Ford collection but if you are a casual fan, this doesn't merit a purchase.Ford's talents are clearly going south here, years of drink and failing eyesight are in evidence.  A better choice for this period would be the epic The Searchers with Wayne made only a year earlier.  The next worthy effort, in my opinion, was the Horse Soldiers made 2 years later, also with Wayne.  Then he got it together to make one last final solid offering, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (Wayne yet again), before slumping further into old age and bad health.

288272,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301978595,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","""Wings of Eagles"" is a 1957 color bio pic about Frank ""Spig"" Wead and his fight to promote naval aviation between the Wars. Wead (1895-1947) fought in WW 1 as an Ensign and got promoted to Lt. JG. After the war he worked at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola where he became an aviator, and he served in WW 2. In his spare time, Wead wrote screenplays, mostly military, and eventually saw 8 films made including ""test Pilot"" (1938), ""The Citadel"" (1938), and ""They Were Expendable"" (1945) - the latter starred John Wayne who plays Wead in this film, ands it was directed by John Ford who directs this film.John Wayne (1907-79)  was the major box office draw at the time, having appeared in such hits as ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""They Were Expendable"" (1945), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), ""Rio Grande"" (1950), and ""Flying Leathernecks"" (1951), ""The Quiet Man""  (1952), ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954) and ""The Searchers"" (1956). He was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949).  This was his 147th film.FWIW - Wayne portrayed an aviator in 6 films including this one.John Ford (1894-1973) and Wayne worked together on 21 films, one of the most prodigious collaborations in film history. This was Ford's 126th film (including 61 silent films). He had already won 4 Oscars - ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), ""How Green was My Valley"" (1941), ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940), and ""The Informer"" (1935).What would a John Ford and John Wayne film be like without Ward Bond? Bond (1903-1960) was a USC football player with friend  John Wayne, and together they appeared in more than a dozen films including ""Dakota"" (1945), ""They Were Expendable"" (1945), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""The Searchers"" (1956), , and ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). Without Wayne, Bond was also a staple in Ford's stock company and appeared in ""Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)"", ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and ""The Grapes of Wrath (1940) among the 25 films they made together. He's probably best remembered for his role as Major Seth Adams on the TV series ""Wagon Train"" (1957 - 1961). Bond was in more Top 100 AFI films (7) than any other actor, and appeared in 11 films that were nominated as Best Picture. Bond plays a fictional character named John Dodge who was based on John Ford.It must be old home week because Maureen O'Hara is also in the cast. O'Hara (1921) and Ford worked together on only 5 films, but she was his favorite leading lady, not the least reason being that she was Irish through and through. Early on she lit up the screen at 19 as Esmeralda in ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939) and followed that with her first John Ford film in ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941) for which Ford won his second Oscar. She could play comedy (""Miracle on 34th Street in 1947), or action (""Bagdad"" in 1949). She did 5 films with Wayne - ""Rio Grande"" (1950), ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), ""Big Jake"" (1971), ""McClintock"" (1963), and ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957).Versatile Dan Dailey (1915-78) plays Wayne's buddy ""Jug head"" and the chief petty officer. He made nearly 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for ""When My Baby Smiles at Me"" (1948) and won a Golden Globe for ""The Governor and J.J."" (1969). I remember him best as ""Dizzy"" Dean in ""The Pride of St Louis"" (1952). In WW 2 he served in the Army.John Ford staples Ken Curtis, Olive Carey, Jack Pennick, Mae Marsh, and Willis Bouchey are also in the cast. Ken Curtis (1916-91), who played Charley McCorry in ""The Searchers"" was married to John Ford's daughter and Ford kept him busy in many films including ""Rio Grande"" (1950), ""Mr. Roberts"" (1955), ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""The Last Hurrah"" (1958), ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), ""Two Rode Together"" (1961), and ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964). Curtis is probably best remembered for his role as Festus in the TV series ""Gunsmoke"" (1964 - 1975).Willis Bouchey (1907-77) made nearly 200 films and TV appearances, often working with Ford and/or Wayne in films like ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), ""Sergeant Rutledge"" (1960),  ""Two Rode Together"" (1961), and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962). I remember him best as the President from ""Red Planet Mars"" (1952). He was a busy actor. In 1957 alone he appeared in this and 7 other films as well as guest roles on 11 different TV shows. Bouchey plays a Congressman.Rumpled faced Jack Pennick (1895-1964) made more films with John Ford than any other actor (41), mostly as an extra. Among his credited roles he played Amos in ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939), Doc in ""They Were Expendable"" (1945), Sgt Schattuck in ""Fort Apache"" (1948), and the barman in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962).Olive Carey (1896-1988) plays Wayne's housekeeper. She was the wife of actor Harry Carey and mother of Harry Carey Jr., both of whom were in dozens of Ford films. In fact, Harry Sr. was the man who got Ford his first job directing.Mae March (1894-1968) plays a nurse. She made 17 films with John Ford. She was a great silent film star (""Birth of a Nation"", ""Intolerance"") who retired but was forced to return to films after the Wall Street crash of 1929.The marvelous Sig Ruman (1884-1967) has a small part as the manager of a restaurant where the Army and the Navy have two big fights. You know Ruman as the prissy German officer/aristocrat who appeared in Marx Brothers comedies before the War, and then switched to dramatic roles in films like ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"" (1939) and ""The Hitler Gang"" (1944).The film starts out as a comedy, and Ford and Wayne were never particularly skilled in this area. As well, Wayne is supposed to be playing a new cadet, but he is 50 years old, while the real Spig Wead was a mere 24. Most of the film retells the story of Spig's life, and there are almost no actual aviation scenes. Aviation and war fans will not find the film attractive, but for fans of the Duke it will probably suffice. This is another of his good acting jobs.Fans of  Naval aviation should take a look at  ""Hell Divers"" (1931), ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), ""Flight Command"" (1940), ""Dive Bomber"" (1941), ""A Wing and a Prayer"" (1945),  ""Midway"" (1975), ""Top Gun"" (1986), ""BAT 21"" (1988), and ""Flight of the Intruder"" (1991). All of them will provide a lot more aviation. Fans of the Duke might be better served with films like ""The Quiet Man"" and ""The High and the Mighty"" and ""The Searchers"", all of which are from the same era but infinitely better films.The film does have the pure pleasure of watching Ward Bond parody his good friend John Ford. Ward wears dark glasses, the hat, carries a stick, smokes a pipe, and drinks whiskey. His office is strewn with Western memorabilia and a slew of Oscars and he has the John Ford ""slouch"" down to a tee. Very funny.The film is also one of the few times the Duke appears in a film sans toupee. Ward had thinning hair so Wayne took off his toupee and went au natural.",3,Interesting bio pic,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,6854,"['Wings', 'Eagles', '1957', 'color', 'bio', 'pic', 'Frank', 'Spig',

288273,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,6301978595,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","I am a huge fan of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara.  I had never seen this movie before (didn't even know of its existence), so I had looked forward to watching it for the first time.  I wish I could say my viewing experience was a happy one, that this was a movie I could add to my collection.  Sadly, it was not what I had hoped for or expected from the talented people involved.  In his haste to pay tribute to a friend, John Ford ignored some of the basic tenets of filmmaking.  Scenes were abrupt, time was ignored/distorted, the tone of the piece kept shifting wildly, characters were introduced then unceremoniously abandoned, there was a galling misrepresentation of historical facts (not to mention this turned out to be an unflattering portrait, friend or not).  Poor Maureen O'Hara received short shrift for a useless part; she might as well not have been in the film.  The slapstick made me cringe (they did everything but speed up the film for the part where they ran into the water a la the Keystone Cops!).  When it suddenly turned maudlin, it felt forced.  They never really delved into anything, this is about as shallow as it can get.  Worse, they glossed over the truly nasty bits in an attempt to show this irresponsible clown as somehow endearing (that he proved likable at all was due to Wayne's performance, in anyone else's hands this man would be seen for what he was: a selfish guy who abandoned his family so he could concentrate on what he felt was the most important thing in his life, him).  I saw nothing to celebrate here but a few outstanding actors doing their best: Ken Curtis, Ward Bond, and especially Dan Dailey as Jughead Carson.  The actors involved kept me from totally hating this film, by the end I was willing to think it was okay, but nothing brilliant, nothing I'd ever want to watch again (I have much better John Wayne movies in my collection for that).Disappointed.",3,"""No cakes and no swimming pools.""",1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,1912,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'existence', 'so', 'had', 'looked', 'forward', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'viewing', 'experience', 'was', 'happy', 'one', 'was', 'movie', 'could', 'add', 'collection', 'Sadly', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'expected', 'talented', 'people', 'involved', 'haste', 'pay', 'tribute', 'friend', 'John', 'Ford', 'ignored', 'basic', 'tenets', 'filmmaking', 'Scenes', 'were', 'abrupt', 'time', 'was', 'ignored/distorted', 'tone', 'piece', 'kept', 'shifting', 'wildly', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'then', 'unceremoniously', 'abandoned', 'was', 'galling', 'misrepresentation', 'historical', 'facts', 'not', 'mention', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'unflattering', 'portrait', 'friend', 'not', 'Poor', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'received', 'short', 'shrift', 'useless', 'part', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'slapstick', 'made', 'cringe', 'did', 'everything', 'speed', 'up', 'film', 'part', 'where', 'ran', 'water', 'la', 'Keystone', 'Cops', 'When', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'maudlin', 'felt', 'forced', 'never', 'really', 'delved', 'anything', 'about', 'as', 'shallow', 'can', 'get', 'Worse', 'glossed', 'truly', 'nasty', 'bits', 'attempt', 'show', 'irresponsible', 'clown', 'somehow', 'endearing', 'proved', 'likable', 'was', 'due', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'anyone', 'else', 'hands', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'what', 'was', 'selfish', 'guy', 'who', 'abandoned', 'family', 'could', 'concentrate', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'saw', 'nothing', 'celebrate', 'here', 'few', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'doing', 'best', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'especially', 'Dan', 'Dailey', 'Jughead', 'Carson', 'actors', 'involved', 'totally', 'hating', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'willing', 'think', 'was', 'okay', 'nothing', 'brilliant', 'nothing', ""'d"", 'ever', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'collection', '.Disappointed']",N/A

At times it has a very Gomer Pyle feel to it at other times it has a Last Days of Patton feel.The Transfer is descent for its age doesn't seem to have been given anything special, though that's not surprised when you think of John Wayne this isn't the first movie to come to mind, the audio isn't in 5.1 but it's not a movie that lends itself to needing it. As most of the movies of the 1950's it has that parent trap look too it, which to me ads to the charm of the movie. Of course let's not forget John Ford Directed it.In conclusion for 10 bucks it's a great DVD to own.

While not a biography in the strictest sense the movie highlights his life adventures, beginning as he serves as one of the first naval flight cadets and ending with his final retirement during WWII.  John Wayne stars in the role of Spig, Maureen O'Hara as his wife and Dan Dailey as the supportive Navy CPO ""Jughead"" Carson.While somewhat comical at times, the movie portrays actually events as Spig takes on the Army in the quest to support naval aviation.  Unfortunately, life takes a nasty turn leaving Spig Weed crippled with little chance of recovery and now medically out of the navy.  Spig now turns to writing and is offered a job to write about the navy for a Hollywood producer who is actually a representation of Director John Ford and played by Ward Bond.  As WWII approaches and Spig is able to maneuver his way back to the Navy with the help his supportive naval friends.

It was worth the wait.The film tells the story of Frank ""Spig"" Wead, a pioneer of naval aviation. John Wayne plays the lead and does so with his customary toughness, a bit of comedy and plenty of bittersweet moments. John Ford directed this work and it demonstrates a love for the navy and for the person of Spig Wead.Spig was in on the beginning of naval aviation. He was larger than life and fought to keep naval aviation funded in the years between world wars. He was adept at using the press and pulling off stunts. All of this came to an end after a home accident in which he was paralyzed. As a result of the accident he was retired from the navy even though he did manage to learn to walk again (barely).After the navy, he became a successful screen and stage writer. Most of his work was centered around the navy, a constant love of his life. When WWII broke out, he naturally tried to go back to sea but was refused because of his disability. Instead, he was put to work in logistics where he put together a system to keep fleet carriers supplied. It was not glorious but it was needed.Eventually, he did get back to sea. His heart, though, made continued service impractical and he was retired quietly. His health matters did not prevent him from making valuable contributions, though.The film has plenty of comedy in the form of rivalry with the army. Maureen O'Hara plays the leading lady who loves her husband but who hates the role of a navy wife and the loneliness that entails. The character is unrealistic and larger than life. That makes it a good Wayne vehicle. Frank Wead was that type of person and so was John Wayne.It's a good story.

Indeed, I remember having the Dell comic book tie-in. However, of those three -- the other two being The Horse Soldiers and Donovan's Reef -- this is my least favorite. Although early Naval aviation is an interesting diversion of sorts for Ford and Wayne, this film has an overlying sense of melancholy and emptiness that is sometimes difficult to sit through. The life of Spig Wead, on which the picture is based, was not a particularly happy one, and any sense of victory in the end is a subdued one, to be sure. A number of actors turn in fine supporting roles, especially Dan Dailey, Ken Curtis, Kenneth Tobey and Maureen O'Hara. Oh, and Ward Bond, who portrays Ford himself under the alias of John Dodge. Wayne himself turns in a rather good performance himself, for Wayne at least. Still, the typical Ford humor is a bit flat for me here, and some of the scenes have the air, quite frankly, of stock footage. But while the Ford combine is a bit creaky in this outing, the subject matter remains compelling, despite that depressive atmosphere I spoke of earlier.

He was also a friend of John Ford, who directs this biopic...the John Ford character appears in the film, thinly disguised as John Dodge, played by Ward Bond. John Wayne plays Wead in one of his better roles...he has to do some real acting in this film as Wead was crippled in mid-life in a home accident and his mobility was limited at best through the rest of his life. Maureen O'Hara plays Wead's wife, Min, one of five collaborations between Wayne and the fiery redhead. I don't know if there was anything going on off-screen; but their on-screen chemistry was always there, including in this film.
