1003801,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B000GG4Y50,Beau Yarbrough,"[6, 8]","I can't remember the last time I laughed so consistently all the way through a movie. I have to wonder what is going on with Saturday Night Live, since this was produced by Lorne Michaels, written by Tina Faye, and every adult but one is a current or former SNL cast member. Why does the show suck so much when this movie was so great?In any case, ""Mean Girls"" is probably the best teen comedy ever, sharp, funny, relentlessly unsentimental, with strong (but not perfect) acting, some clever twists and a solid soundtrack.I don't know of any film that so well observed the nature of high school cliques (and cheerfully discusses groups like the ""angry hot black chicks"" who certainly were a clique in my high school), the way teenagers (particularly girls) treat each other and even the quirks of the teachers (unlike most teen films, they aren't all ciphers or buffoons here). A lot of the bits feel very authentic, including the central plot element of the Burn Book, in which the titular mean girls write things about the other students in the school to make themselves feel better. Other great bits include real-looking high school students (except for the four mean girls themselves), the terribly true to life wannabe ""cool"" parent and one of the girls dumbing herself down to be able to talk to a cute guy without it being corny and ridiculous like a feature-length afterschool special.There's a bit of drinking (which ends with someone getting very drunk and embarassed) and a bit of talk about sex (which never goes anywhere beyond someone taking off their shirt), so it's a surprisingly family friendly film for parents of preteens.A great film with an actual decent message, but which relentlessly refuses to give into cliches or heartwarming schmaltz. Strongly recommended to anyone who ever really wanted to like teen movies, stretching all the way back to the John Hughes era, but who found them a bit too nauseating at the end of the day.",5,Probably the best teen comedy ever,1083715200,"05 5, 2004",2004,1953,"['ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'laughed', 'so', 'consistently', 'way', 'movie', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'was', 'produced', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'written', 'Tina', 'Faye', 'adult', 'one', 'current', 'former', 'SNL', 'cast', 'member', 'Why', 'show', 'suck', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'case', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'probably', 'best', 'teen', 'comedy', 'ever', 'sharp', 'funny', 'relentlessly', 'unsentimental', 'strong', 'not', 'perfect', 'acting', 'clever', 'twists', 'solid', 'soundtrack.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'nature', 'high', 'school', 'cliques', 'cheerfully', 'groups', 'angry', 'hot', 'black', 'chicks', 'who', 'certainly', 'were', 'clique', 'high', 'school', 'way', 'teenagers', 'particularly', 'girls', 'treat', 'other', 'even', 'quirks', 'teachers', 'most', 'teen', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'ciphers', 'buffoons', 'here', 'lot', 'bits', 'feel', 'very', 'authentic', 'including', 'central', 'plot', 'element', 'Burn', 'Book', 'titular', 'mean', 'girls', 'write', 'things', 'other', 'students', 'school', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'Other', 'great', 'bits', 'include', 'real-looking', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'four', 'mean', 'girls', 'terribly', 'true', 'life', 'wannabe', 'cool', 'parent', 'one', 'girls', 'dumbing', 'down', 'be', 'able', 'talk', 'cute', 'guy', 'being', 'corny', 'ridiculous', 'feature-length', 'afterschool', 'bit', 'drinking', 'someone', 'getting', 'very', 'drunk', 'embarassed', 'bit', 'talk', 'sex', 'never', 'anywhere', 'someone', 'taking', 'off', 'shirt', 'surprisingly', 'family', 'friendly', 'film', 'parents', 'preteens.A', 'great', 'film', 'actual', 'decent', 'message', 'relentlessly', 'give', 'cliches', 'heartwarming', 'schmaltz', 'Strongly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'teen', 'movies', 'stretching', 'way', 'back', 'John', 'Hughes', 'era', 'who', 'found', 'bit', 'too', 'nauseating', 'end', 'day']",Mean Girls / Clueless

If she thought the jungles of Africa were rough, she hasn't seen anything yet.  Upon entering her new school, she begins to see how much it is like the jungles of her previous home.  The kill or be killed world of teen queendom is even more viscious than a lions den at feeding time.  To make matters worse, the popular crowd takes an interest in Cady and invites her to join them.  Janice and Damian (Cady's true friends?) think it would be fun for Cady to join ""The Plastics"", and uncover their secrets, so as to destroy them.  Of course, when do things ever go as planned, Cady ends up liking the popularity and power that goes along with her new placement, and REALLY let's it go to her head.

1003803,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B000GG4Y50,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[31, 34]","Mean Girls is a definite ""must-see"" for any Lindsay Lohan fan.  This movie isn't just for teenage girls either.  It is a good comedy (surprising, considering some of the cast are from Saturday Night Live - past and present) with some very realistic high school portrayals.  I watched the movie with my wife and daughter, but almost every other person in the theater was of high school age; I heard a lot of people mumbling about how accurate a lot of the stereotyping mentioned in the movie is (in other words, parts of the movie reminded them of their school, today).As always, Lindsay Lohan played her part to perfection; she has more talent than most Hollywood actresses.  Lohan plays the part of a formerly home-schooled (in Africa) teenager who enters a typical high school after her parents move back to America.  She makes friends with two misfits who layout the general explanation of what Cady (Lohan) Heron is about to experience at the Illinois public school; a place where the students have given the word ""diversity"" a whole new meaning - mainly, ""separate and NOT equal""!  Geeks hang with geeks; the jocks hag with jocks.  You get the picture.One group, The Plastics, have supreme status over most the other groups, especially in their ability to belittle the rest.  Rachel McAdams is excellent as the leader of The Plastics; I could not picture any other actress playing this part as well.  Her character drags Cady into her inner-circle and the fun begins.There are a lot of great supporting actors and actresses in this film.  Most notably, Lizzy Caplan almost stole the show with her incredible performance as Janis Ian, one of the misfits who befriends Cady.  She was in Orange County and a few lesser known films and TV shows, but man can she act!There are also a few ""not so good"" performances.  Tim Meadows is a great guy, but he seemed to be in skit-mode in this movie.  Same goes for Amy Poehler and Ana Gasteyer; they never seemed to fit on the silver screen as well as Tina Fey did.  I think Fey fits the silver-screen well.  I mean she is beautiful, smart, and has a great smile - yep, a star is born!I enjoyed this movie; most of the people in the theater seemed to enjoy it (by the way, every show was sold-out); and if you think Lindsay Lohan is one of the hottest stars around, you'll enjoy this movie too.  Don't let the few lackluster performances scare you away; Amanda Seyfried, Jonathan Bennett, Daniel Franzese, Lizzy Caplan, Lacey Chabert, Tina Fey, Rachel McAdams, and Lohan all turn in GREAT performances, worthy of ticket price or future DVD purchase.On thing I haven't mentioned is the message of this movie:  We need to worry more about ourselves, and that we shouldn't put others down just to make ourselves look better.  I think the movie managed to get that message across without being too corny.

While it bears a striking resemblence to the infamous ""Heathers"" - it's more modern and a quite a bit funnier.  The movie was written by Tina Fey, of Saturday Night Live fame, who definitely has a future as a screenwriter, I believe!  For the most part, the movie is witty and amusing.  The time went by pretty fast, and I don't think there was a moment I looked at my watch out of boredom.The cast was great!  Lindsey Lohan is s superb young actress who is pretty, but not artifically so.  She plays a teenage girl, Cady, just starting high school for the first time after being homeschooled for 17 years and travelling all over the world with her parents.  At first she doesn't fit in, of course, and becomes friends with a goth girl and a gay guy who like to make fun of the popular girls, aka ""The Plastics,"" led by Regina George.  The three of them make a plan for Cady to infiltrate the Plastics and basically ruin Regina's life.  The plan works a little too well, especially since Cady finds herself falling for Regina's on-again/off-again boyfriend.The rest of the cast is pretty good... Tina Fey plays Cady's totally un-cool math teacher.  Amy Poehller (I'm sure I spelled her last name wrong), another SNL star, does a phenominal job playing Regina's mother who wants so badly to be cool and hip and her daughter's best friend, but comes off as totally crazy.  One of the funniest characters in the movie is math geek Kevin G (not sure who the actor is) who tries hard to be a cool DJ and ladies' man, but is also a ""mathlete"" (aka on the math team).Overall the movie was funny and lighthearted, with a strong moral at the end.  The story moved at a good pace and kepy my interest the entire time, which is pretty uncommon.  I give it four and a half stars!  While most of the cast was great, I found the goth girl character to be pretty well, unlikeable.  I didn't have much sympathy for her and found her somewhat annoying.

1003810,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000GG4Y50,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[28, 48]","There are three things I already believed before I went to go see &quot;Mean Girls,&quot; and which were not changed by watching the film.  First, you cannot be too mean to a mean girl because they are pretty much impervious to just about everything.  Both this movie and the book which inspired it, Rosalind Wiseman's &quot;Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence,&quot; have been the topic of talk shows where they have brought in real, live &quot;mean girls,&quot; and nothing on earth can get through their head that their are wretched human beings.  In this movie the effort to get the chief mean girl, Regina George (Rachel McAdams), by our heroine, Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), does not go nearly far enough to really get through to her.  The point of a movie like this is for the villain to get her comeupance, and what happens here does not really satisfying the anger in my soul at such human beings.Second, the worst year for mean girls is the 8th grade.  These mean girls are juniors in high school.  Granted, junior girls are as bad as it gets in high school, because senior girls tend to unclench their hair and enjoy their last year, but they have nothing on 8th grade girls.  That is when they hit puberty, before the boys and at a time when the boys are not worth pursuing, so they turn on each other.  Most of the mean things the mean girls do to themselves and each other in this film my youngest daughter says happens in her school all the time and she is only in the 7th grade.  These girls are getting off lucky.Third, Tina Fey is the sexiest woman on television.  She is the sexiest woman on television because the head writer on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; is the smartest woman on television.  Not that her character is pretend smart, like Jennifer Garner's Sidney Bristow is smart on &quot;Alias,&quot; but really smart, as in a wicked bad sense of humor.  The fact that she is even more cute with those glasses on is just gravy, just like her first appearance in this movie.Fey wrote the script for &quot;Mean Girls,&quot; and if anything she has softened her barbs because she actually has an important point to make to her audience and this movie is perfectly suited to bring her target group in because when I went to theater there were dozens of groups of young girls, teenagers and young, there to see the film.  The big question is whether or not this film will have any impact on the behavior of these girls.  If I had to make a bet, it would be that this film is going to inspire them to gang up on the mean girls at their own schools and turn the tables on them (not that this would necessarily be a bad thing given the notion of cosmic justice).Lohan's character is considered a &quot;Martian&quot; by her new classmates, because she has been home schooled until the age of 16 while living in Africa, so she knows nothing about the social do's and don't's of high school (a state beyond that of Rory being a &quot;Mary&quot; on the first season of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;).  She gets the perspective of both extremes of the high school girl world with Regina on the one side and Goth-girl Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) on the other.  All this really does is teach her where the battle lines are drawn, but what she really needs is a crash course in how to play the game.  Fey tries to refrain from actually teaching girls to be mean girls, which puts her in a Catch-22 because she cannot give us satisfaction without being really mean and being really mean endorses the idea that is the only way to get satisfaction.The only real flaw in the set up of &quot;Mean Girls&quot; is that there really is not a good reason for Regina to admit Cady to the Plastics inner circle, but you have to accept the idea so we can get on with the festivities.  After all, Regina does not need to co-opt the new girl in school to have her ostracized by the assembled masses.  The other concern I have is whether Fey should have given the articulation of the film's message to her own character when she points out to them why calling each other fat, stupid, and even worse names is not productive.This 2004 film, directed by Mark S. Waters (&quot;Freaky Friday&quot;) has a handful of &quot;SNL&quot; performs.  Ana Gasteyer is wasted as Cady's mom and Amy Poehler is the film's one adult caricature as Mrs. George, but it is Tim Meadows whose controlled comic performance stands out among the older actors.  Of the kids the one who commands attention is Lacey Chabert as Gretchen Wieners, the Queen Bee's left hand dancer until Cady comes along.  Just watch Chabert's eyes as her character goes through all the agonies of trying to figure out the right thing to say to keep her place in the pecking order.",4,"Listen up, girls of America, Tina Fey has something to say",1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,4803,"['are', 'three', 'things', 'already', 'believed', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'quot', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'quot', 'were', 'not', 'changed', 'watching', 'film', 'First', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'mean', 'mean', 'girl', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'impervious', 'just', 'everything', 'movie', 'book', 'inspired', 'Rosalind', 'Wiseman', 'quot', 'Queen', 'Bees', 'Wannabes', 'Helping', 'Daughter', 'Survive', 'Cliques', 'Gossip', 'Boyfriends', 'Other', 'Realities', 'Adolescence', 'quot', 'have', 'been', 'topic', 'talk', 'shows', 'where', 'have', 'brought', 'real', 'live', 'quot', 'mean', 'girls', 'quot', 'nothing', 'earth', 'can', 'get', 'head', 'are', 'wretched', 'human', 'beings', 'movie', 'effort', 'get', 'chief', 'mean', 'girl', 'Regina', 'George', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'heroine', 'Cady', 'Heron', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'not', 'go', 'nearly', 'far', 'enough', 'really', 'get', 'point', 'movie', 'villain', 'get', 'comeupance', 'what', 'here', 'not', 'really', 'satisfying', 'anger', 'soul', 'such', 'human', 'beings.Second', 'worst', 'year', 'mean', 'girls', '8th', 'grade', 'mean', 'girls', 'are', 'juniors', 'high', 'school', 'Granted', 'junior', 'girls', 'are', 'as', 'bad', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'girls', 'tend', 'unclench', 'hair', 'enjoy', 'last', 'year', 'have', 'nothing', '8th', 'grade', 'girls', 'when', 'hit', 'puberty', 'boys', 'time', 'when', 'boys', 'are', 'not', 'worth', 'pursuing', 'turn', 'other', 'Most', 'mean', 'things', 'mean', 'girls', 'do', 'other', 'film', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'school', 'time', 'only', '7th', 'grade', 'girls', 'are', 'getting', 'off', 'lucky.Third', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'sexiest', 'woman', 'television', 'sexiest', 'woman', 'television', 'head', 'writer', 'quot', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'quot', 'smartest', 'woman', 'television', 'Not', 'character', 'pretend', 'smart', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Sidney', 'Bristow', 'smart', 'quot', 'Alias', 'quot', 'really', 'smart', 'wicked', 'bad', 'sense', 'humor', 'fact', 'even', 'more', 'cute', 'glasses', 'just', 'gravy', 'just', 'first', 'appearance', 'movie.Fey', 'wrote', 'script', 'quot', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'quot', 'anything', 'softened', 'barbs', 'actually', 'important', 'point', 'make', 'audience', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'bring', 'target', 'group', 'when', 'went', 'theater', 'were', 'dozens', 'groups', 'young', 'girls', 'teenagers', 'young', 'see', 'film', 'big', 'question', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'impact', 'behavior', 'girls', 'had', 'make', 'bet', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'going', 'inspire', 'gang', 'up', 'mean', 'girls', 'own', 'schools', 'turn', 'tables', 'not', 'would', 'necessarily', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'given', 'notion', 'cosmic', 'justice', '.Lohan', 'character', 'considered', 'quot', 'Martian', 'quot', 'new', 'classmates', 'been', 'home', 'schooled', 'age', '16', 'living', 'Africa', 'nothing', 'social', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", ""'s"", 'high', 'school', 'state', 'Rory', 'being', 'quot', 'Mary', 'quot', 'first', 'season', 'quot', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'quot', 'perspective', 'extremes', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'world', 'Regina', 'one', 'side', 'Goth-girl', 'Janis', 'Ian', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'other', 'really', 'teach', 'where', 'battle', 'lines', 'are', 'drawn', 'what', 'really', 'crash', 'course', 'how', 'play', 'game', 'Fey', 'refrain', 'actually', 'teaching', 'girls', 'be', 'mean', 'girls', 'Catch-22', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'satisfaction', 'being', 'really', 'mean', 'being', 'really', 'mean', 'idea', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'satisfaction.The', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'set', 'quot', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'quot', 'really', 'not', 'good', 'reason', 'Regina', 'admit', 'Cady', 'Plastics', 'inner', 'circle', 'have', 'accept', 'idea', 'can', 'get', 'festivities', 'Regina', 'not', 'need', 'co-opt', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'have', 'ostracized', 'assembled', 'masses', 'other', 'concern', 'have', 'Fey', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'articulation', 'film', 'message', 'own', 'character', 'when', 'out', 'why', 'calling', 'other', 'fat', 'stupid', 'even', 'worse', 'names', 'not', 'productive.This', '2004', 'film', 'directed', 'Mark', 'S.', 'Waters', 'quot', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'quot', 'handful', 'quot', 'SNL', 'quot', 'performs', 'Ana', 'Gasteyer', 'wasted', 'Cady', 'mom', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'film', 'one', 'adult', 'caricature', 'Mrs.', 'George', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'controlled', 'comic', 'performance', 'out', 'older', 'actors', 'kids', 'one', 'who', 'attention', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'Gretchen', 'Wieners', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'left', 'hand', 'dancer', 'Cady', 'along', 'Just', 'watch', 'Chabert', 'eyes', 'character', 'agonies', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'right', 'thing', 'say', 'keep', 'place', 'pecking', 'order']",Mean Girls / Clueless
1003811,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,B000GG4Y50,L. J Nary,"[0, 0]","The movie reflects a honest view of high school life in that it shows the desire to be somebody in a positive sense. The craving to be looked up to and admired, is still happening in a way through the hollywood circuit, even after high school. Fame and glory seem to be very important in the world in general. This is easily glimpsed in the movie by taking a really sweet innocent girl and putting her with the in crowd at high school and than seeing how control and power can corrupt faster than reciting the alphabet. I wish the movie had more of a dramatic edge to it so it could have been taking maybe a little more seriously. Although comedy is marketable and this comedy at times gets a little silly and unbelievable. It would have been really nice to actually see a mix of comedy, more curbed and drama with the story line yet I think this film will appeal to a young crowd. It has Lohan in the lead, who seems to be one of the queen bees herself in the disney crowd circuit, as well as jumping up in the teen tiger beat gen. Her real fame seems to conflict with the storyline in a way. It seems like they portray in real life what they are trying to act out, reflecting it as not a good thing. It seems kinda funny.  The need for attention becomes an addiction and the lose of self follows. I liked the premise. Some parts were not predictable and gave the film a neat style. Yet other parts were sickeningly predictable like the end. I wish it could have stayed true to its creativity. I thought the girls were pushing the envelope with the language, only in the sense that it will probably attract a younger generation as well as the teen crowd. Because I am an adult it was a bit tamer than many films I have viewed yet for a child this is showing Lohan as a regular teen with all the trimmings.

1003818,A1HVJELFV84ISH,B000GG4Y50,QUEEN_OF_EVERYTHING,"[9, 17]","Judging by the trailer, I expected MEAN GIRLS to be a cheesy screwball comedy with not much heart and a few laughs tossed in along the way.  But I was very wrong in my assumption.MEAN GIRLS instead chronicles the life of Cady Heron, a homeschooled student who spent her life in Africa.  For the first time, she must walk through the doors of a public high school.  She's nervous but feels she can get through her first day and come home in one piece.  In a way, she's wrong.  Her first day goes horribly.But after meeting Janis Ian and her best friend, totally out and proud Damien, Cady (pronounced like ""Katie"") is glad to be befriended by the two social misfits who, prior to her arrival, have enjoyed no one's company but their own.  ""I'm going to call you ""Caddie"","" Janis says.  The three make an interesting trio.Written by Tina Fey of Saturday Night Live fame, MEAN GIRLS is wickedly funny, laced with satire-esque humor and lots of laughs.  Lindsay proves that, unlike Hilary Duff, she can act.  Parallels can be drawn between MEAN GIRLS and my favorite movie of all time, HEATHERS.What originally begins as an experiment goes horribly wrong.  Janis, Damien, and Cady have decided that Cady must infiltrate the renown Plastics clique.  Because Cady is a beautiful girl, she is welcomed to the Plastics lunch table.  Leader Regina George and her friends, Gretchen and Karen, are three girls seriously blessed in the looks department.  It at first seems as if everyone envies their social spotlight but in reality, while some do, others loathe them.Like Janis Ian, for example.Regina is wonderfully played by beautiful Rachel McAdams (The Hot Chick).  Insecure Gretchen is played by Party of Five actress (and the voice of Eliza Thornberry!) Lacey Chabert.  Karen is played by newcomer Amanda Seyfried, who is still actually a high-schooler.  Despite this being her first film role, she looked familiar to me.  OT but I found out it is her face that graces the covers of the Victoria Martin series by Francine Pascal.The plan against the Plastics first conjured up by Janis soon turns ugly.  It had been Cady's goal to destory the Plastics.  Instead, she takes Regina George's place as the leader of the gang and almost loses her two true friends.  And Regina is not happy.  The trouble between her and Cady begins when she falls for Regina's ex boyfriend, Aaron, played by Eric Bennett, I think - he's also a newcomer and so incredibly hottttt I cannot even describe it.  I pray to God I see him in more roles soon.Cady grows into a mean, spoiled brat.  Aaron is a genuinely nice guy and after he and Regina reconcile and break up again, he is drawn to Cady until he sees her true colors.  Now she must deal with him disliking her - he sits in front of her in Advanced Calc.  Cady must also deal with the fact Janis and Damien can't stand the sight of her and that Regina's wrath can seriously be damaging.  Even her parents have noticed she's changed - and for the worse!  Cady's plethora of problems sorted out isn't dealt with in an easy-breezy fashion, which I really thought was to the movie's advantage.Hilarious moments include a schoolwide brawl due to the Slam Book, a game of Trust that takes place in order for apologies to make rounds, comparisons to high school being similar to Africa's Survival of the Fittest, Cady's party in which Aaron comes up to her bedroom (OOH!), and certain lines I won't reiterate.

Very different: extremely well written (great job Tina Fey), and appealing to anyone who has ever experienced embarassement in the hands of a fellow student (basically everyone!); I was expecting a light-feeling, comedy driven film that stuck to all the superficialness of high school cliques, and never went any further...but it surprised me when it did!The movie pokes fun at all the stereotyped cliques: the popular girls, the smart kids, the asians, the geeks, the wannabees, etc.  In a subtle yet effective way, it poses the question ""why can't we all just get along?""; it addresses the issues that keep teenagers from being friends with each other, and even breaks down a few of those barriers along the way.For those of you worried about content: there is a bit of language in this film: mostly it's many uses of the b-word and the slang version of it, as well as a few other curse words.  There's quite a bit of talk and scenes about high school/teenage issues: condoms, premarital sex, drinking/partying, etc.  You may want to take it in first, before taking a young child along.I have to say I was pretty impressed with the mix of serious and funny in this film; well worth your time to go see it, and ""re-visit"" those high school days again.

1003821,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B000GG4Y50,Sarah Schenkkan,"[6, 7]","To be honest, I had low expectations for this film. From early previews it seemed to me another teen comedy with the same premise as the rest, often featuring a lead who is too perfect looking to pass off as a friendless high school student. But, I was suprised with ""Mean Girls"". Although you are somewhat embarrassed to say so, you have a great time and feel like you got your money's worth.The story follows 16-year-old Cady (Lindsay Lohan), who after transferring from being homeschooled in Africa, to being the new student at an Illinois public school, must adapt to the often cruel, survival-of-the-fittest world of high school teenagers. From teachers and rules to fitting in with the crowd of unfamiliar faces, Cady struggles, but soon befriends the ""art freaks"" Damien (Daniel Franseze) and Janis (Lizzy Caplan), who explain to her the prominent cliques that exist. But soon, she is drawn to The Plastics, the most exclusive clique of all, where only the prettiest and richest girls are asked to join. The Plastics, made up of leader Regina George (Rachel McAdams), rich girl Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert) and less-than brilliant Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried), soon invite her to be a part of them. At first, she accepts as a joke with Janis, but then, as she is elevated to teen royalty, she begins to grow accustomed to the world of The Plastics, and loses sight of her true friends. Things are made more complicated and claws come out when Cady falls for Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett), the ex-boyfriend of Regina.As Cady, Lindsay Lohan gives a solid and likeable performance. She is one of the many rising teen stars, who finds relatively similar roles with each new project. However, unlike so many teen stars, she looks like someone you'd actually encounter at a high school. She doesn't have the perfect stererotypical body, and she's awkward at times, which adds to her realism and charm. Although she is excellent at what she does, I would like to see her in a deeper, more emotionally challenging role, perhaps something along the lines of Evan Rachel Wood's ""Thirteen"" performance. As for the other cast members, Rachel McAdams is sweet and treacherous as Regina, and doe-eyed Amanda Seyfried plays dumb to perfection. However, the highlight of the movie is the performance by Lacey Chabert. As the ever-loyal Gretchen, she is emotionally insecure and at times pathetic, and completely devotes herself to her character.The script, written by SNL's Tina Fey, is smart and hilarious, but falters at points. It is a bit predictable, and some of the jokes fall flat, but overall, it is commendable and well-written. Inner monologues by Cady, and her comparisons of high school situations to that of the animal world are clever and original. Overall, although I have read reviews stating the contrary, I was very satisfied with ""Mean Girls"". It's an enjoyable, humorous, and clever look back at high school and the drama of teenage life.",4,"These ""Girls"" Make For An Entertaining Day At The Movies",1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,2957,"['be', 'honest', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'film', 'early', 'previews', 'seemed', 'teen', 'comedy', 'same', 'premise', 'rest', 'often', 'featuring', 'lead', 'who', 'too', 'perfect', 'looking', 'pass', 'off', 'friendless', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'was', 'suprised', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'are', 'somewhat', 'embarrassed', 'say', 'so', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'feel', 'got', 'money', 'worth.The', 'story', '16-year-old', 'Cady', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'who', 'transferring', 'being', 'homeschooled', 'Africa', 'being', 'new', 'student', 'Illinois', 'public', 'school', 'must', 'adapt', 'often', 'cruel', 'survival-of-the-fittest', 'world', 'high', 'school', 'teenagers', 'teachers', 'rules', 'fitting', 'crowd', 'unfamiliar', 'Cady', 'soon', 'art', 'freaks', 'Damien', 'Daniel', 'Franseze', 'Janis', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'who', 'explain', 'prominent', 'cliques', 'exist', 'soon', 'drawn', 'Plastics', 'most', 'exclusive', 'clique', 'where', 'only', 'prettiest', 'richest', 'girls', 'are', 'asked', 'join', 'Plastics', 'made', 'leader', 'Regina', 'George', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'rich', 'girl', 'Gretchen', 'Weiners', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'less-than', 'brilliant', 'Karen', 'Smith', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'soon', 'invite', 'be', 'part', 'first', 'joke', 'Janis', 'then', 'elevated', 'teen', 'royalty', 'grow', 'accustomed', 'world', 'Plastics', 'sight', 'true', 'friends', 'Things', 'are', 'made', 'more', 'complicated', 'claws', 'come', 'out', 'when', 'Cady', 'Aaron', 'Samuels', 'Jonathan', 'Bennett', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Regina.As', 'Cady', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'solid', 'likeable', 'performance', 'one', 'many', 'rising', 'teen', 'stars', 'who', 'relatively', 'similar', 'roles', 'new', 'project', 'However', 'so', 'many', 'teen', 'stars', 'someone', ""'d"", 'actually', 'encounter', 'high', 'school', ""n't"", 'have', 'perfect', 'stererotypical', 'body', 'awkward', 'times', 'realism', 'charm', 'excellent', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'deeper', 'more', 'emotionally', 'challenging', 'role', 'perhaps', 'something', 'lines', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Thirteen', 'performance', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'sweet', 'treacherous', 'Regina', 'doe-eyed', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'dumb', 'perfection', 'However', 'highlight', 'movie', 'performance', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'ever-loyal', 'Gretchen', 'emotionally', 'insecure', 'times', 'pathetic', 'completely', 'character.The', 'script', 'written', 'SNL', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'smart', 'hilarious', 'falters', 'points', 'bit', 'predictable', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'overall', 'commendable', 'well-written', 'Inner', 'monologues', 'Cady', 'comparisons', 'high', 'school', 'situations', 'animal', 'world', 'are', 'clever', 'original', 'Overall', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'stating', 'contrary', 'was', 'very', 'satisfied', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'enjoyable', 'humorous', 'clever', 'look', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'teenage', 'life']",Mean Girls / Clueless

I love your work!!"" - Damian scares another one away in ""Mean Girls""Lindsey Lohan stars in this above average teen comedy, from Tina Fey of ""Saturday Night Live"" fame, that gets quite a few laughs but doesn't seem to delve into any real life situations other than the classic struggle between classes (the jocks, the dweebs, the click, etc.) in everyday school life.Lohan is the new girl in school, fresh from living in Africa and home schooled all her life by her parents. Of course, she doesn't fit in at first, but is befriended by 2 class outcasts. A unique opportunity opens up for Lohan when the class click (that consists of 3 preppy girls known as ""The Plastics"") decide to induct her as a new member. The outcasts, with co-conspirator Lohan, see this as an oppurtunity to infiltrate and destroy the school controlling group and plot there revenge. However, all plans backfire, and all bets are off, when the leader of ""The Plastics"" uncovers the plot and decides to get even with devastating & hilarious results.""Mean Girls"" is more of a crossbreed between any John Hughes teen-comedy and the less controversal, lighter moments from ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"", than the gross out school comedies from the past (""Mean Girls"" doesn't cover any new ground that the genre hasn't already touched upon). The film has laughs that one might find from the best sketches of ""SNL"", but no real memorable moments. Lohan gives another great performance (Hillary Duff may have the stuff, but Lohan is here to stay). ""SNL"" alum Tim Meadows & Ana Gesteyer are a bit painful to watch in their roles. Meadows is miscast as the high school principal (he may have been better as a confused guidance counseler than a confused principal). Gesteyer looks tired, & pained as Lohan's mom (she looks better on ""SNL"". trust me). Tina Fey shines as the math teacher who helps Lohan wake up & smell the plastic (Fey is a hottie, but, in some shots in this movie she looks older than she usually looks. I blame it on bad photography). Rachel Drasch is great as she lampoons all those single moms who strive too much to be the hip, cool mom, but, turn out to be slutty, washed up drunks. The ending of ""Mean Girls"" is one of the more original & happier (?) endings to this type of film that I've seen in a long time.With the exception of Lohan being a hottie and Fey making comedy sexy, my hopes weren't to high for ""Mean Girls"". I can honestly say I was wrong.
