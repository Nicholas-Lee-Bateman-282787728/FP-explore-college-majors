1030507,A6J8D9V5S9MBE,B000K2V7DW,Curtis G,"[1, 2]","If you're looking for the recent ""Born to Fight""--the one with the terrorists--let me warn you: this is not it. Evidently director Panna Rittikrai liked the title enough to reuse it, but only that and a couple of stunts connect this movie and his 2004 so-called remake. (There's not even an IMDb.com listing for this movie.)On the surface, BTF appears to follow a very simple plot, but it gets so complicated that I still have no idea what was going on. There's some stuff about a lawyer and a notebook, and then some guys in matching jackets beat someone up. (It takes so long to get to the title sequence that a buddy I was watching it with thought it was over and said, ""Is that it?"")We meet the main character, P'Tong, practicing martial arts with his son and daughter. The Matching Jackets Gang shows up to fight him and he beats them all. I have no idea what the point of that was, because then some guy P'Tong knows (his former boss, I guess) gets out of his car and tells P'Tong he needs to go to the city to find someone.P'Tong makes it to the city, but everywhere he goes, some new gang tries to beat him up. He meets up with the inescapable comic relief; they find Uncle Jam and then fight some more. Guys in black coveralls and ski masks jump around in the dark and get P'Tong blamed for something or other. There's some nonsense about mistaken identity, but I was never clear on who the bad guys were or why they needed to kidnap Samsung or Sampan or whatever that guy's name was that P'Tong was looking for. At the end, suddenly the ski-mask ninjas show up again. Finally we get a fight scene worth waiting for (and a bunch of painful-looking stunts that Rittikrai recycled for Tony Jaa). But no terrorists.The comic relief was mostly irritating, but there were a couple of genuinely funny moments. The girl was cute, but absolutely worthless. The one time when I thought she was actually going to fight, she stood up, clenched her fist...and then stepped back and started cheerleading for P'Tong. She deserved the beatdown she got a few minutes later.I applaud the effort, but for the most part, the experience is like watching any no-budget early-80s cookie-cutter Chinese kung fu movie. In some regards, it's downright primitive: the acting is terrible; people and vehicles obviously start from dead stops at the beginning of takes; and the vehicle chases take place at about five miles per hour. But hey--this movie led to another, and another, and the rest is history.Overall, ""Born to Fight '86"" may be worth a look if you really like old school martial arts movies, but for technical proficiency and sheer jaw-dropping stunt work, see the remake.",3,Born to Fight (Gerd Ma Lui - 1986 release),1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,2667,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'recent', 'Born', 'Fight', 'one', 'terrorists', 'let', 'warn', 'not', 'Evidently', 'director', 'Panna', 'Rittikrai', 'liked', 'title', 'enough', 'reuse', 'only', 'couple', 'stunts', 'connect', 'movie', '2004', 'so-called', 'remake', 'not', 'even', 'IMDb.com', 'listing', 'movie', 'surface', 'BTF', 'follow', 'very', 'simple', 'plot', 'so', 'complicated', 'still', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'stuff', 'lawyer', 'notebook', 'then', 'guys', 'matching', 'jackets', 'beat', 'someone', 'up', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'title', 'sequence', 'buddy', 'was', 'watching', 'thought', 'was', 'over', 'said', 'meet', 'main', 'character', ""P'Tong"", 'practicing', 'martial', 'arts', 'son', 'daughter', 'Matching', 'Jackets', 'Gang', 'up', 'fight', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'then', 'guy', ""P'Tong"", 'former', 'boss', 'guess', 'car', 'tells', ""P'Tong"", 'go', 'city', 'find', ""someone.P'Tong"", 'city', 'everywhere', 'new', 'gang', 'tries', 'beat', 'up', 'up', 'inescapable', 'comic', 'relief', 'find', 'Uncle', 'Jam', 'then', 'fight', 'more', 'Guys', 'black', 'coveralls', 'ski', 'masks', 'jump', 'around', 'dark', 'get', ""P'Tong"", 'blamed', 'something', 'other', 'nonsense', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'was', 'never', 'clear', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'why', 'needed', 'kidnap', 'Samsung', 'Sampan', 'guy', 'name', 'was', ""P'Tong"", 'was', 'looking', 'end', 'suddenly', 'ski-mask', 'ninjas', 'show', 'up', 'again', 'Finally', 'get', 'fight', 'scene', 'worth', 'waiting', 'bunch', 'painful-looking', 'stunts', 'Rittikrai', 'recycled', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'terrorists.The', 'comic', 'relief', 'was', 'mostly', 'irritating', 'were', 'couple', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'girl', 'was', 'cute', 'absolutely', 'worthless', 'one', 'time', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'fight', 'stood', 'up', 'clenched', 'fist', 'then', 'stepped', 'back', 'started', 'cheerleading', ""P'Tong"", 'deserved', 'beatdown', 'got', 'few', 'minutes', 'later.I', 'effort', 'most', 'part', 'experience', 'watching', 'no-budget', 'early-80s', 'cookie-cutter', 'Chinese', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'regards', 'downright', 'primitive', 'acting', 'terrible', 'people', 'vehicles', 'obviously', 'start', 'dead', 'stops', 'beginning', 'vehicle', 'chases', 'take', 'place', 'about', 'five', 'miles', 'hour', 'movie', 'led', 'rest', 'history.Overall', 'Born', 'Fight', ""'86"", 'may', 'be', 'look', 'really', 'old', 'school', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'technical', 'proficiency', 'sheer', 'jaw-dropping', 'stunt', 'work', 'see', 'remake']",Born to Fight
1030508,A29NRLC2CLHU6S,B000K2V7DW,Darth Vegas,"[0, 0]","I'm not sure why Amazon insists on linking the reviews of all the movies with the same title -- since there are often many releases of the same movie (often, of very different quality and with different features), and in this case, entirely different movies with the same name, how the hell do you know what movie is really being reviewed?Having gotten that off my chest, I really liked this newer ""Dragon Dynasty"" release.  You can smell the ""Ong Bak"" influence all over it -- so much so that you really wonder why they didn't just cast Tony Jaa in the lead (hell, even the lead henchman in ""Ong Bak"" is the lead henchman in ""Born to Fight""!).  Story is nothing special, though I found it surprisingly heartbreaking at times (though it does take the cheap and easy route to identify who is very good and who is very bad -- with one notable exception, who could have been better developed -- the character ""Tub"").What you really watch this for is, of course, the stunts and the fighting.  The latter wasn't anything special -- again, there are many nods to ""Ong Bak"" (and some direct ripoffs from fights in that movie).  What sets the movie apart are its numerous jawdropping stunts.  You are left to wonder how anyone didn't die making this movie.  Often, I jumped back while watching this, yelling ""ouch!"" and ""ohh!""  You will too!The things I were least impressed with were some of the acting, some of the silly fight parts with the soccer balls (you really have to suspend disbelief, though they 'are' entertaining), and the badly done CGI (you'll know what I mean).This, like many other recent Thai action movies, does stand in the shadow of the mighty ""Ong Bak"" and ""The Protector,"" but it 'is' a very entertaining movie -- one you'll want to watch with friends, so you can all go ""Ouch!"" together.  Some violent bits but no real gore (unless you count the bazooka-Rambo bit near the end).

1030509,A1EGZYG8PC51U5,B000K2V7DW,"D. Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[3, 4]","The stunts really are that gonzo in this!  During the incredible opening sequence, that involves a brawl on the top of 2 parallel moving tractor trailers, a goon gets knocked down between them and his head looks literally INCHES from being crushed by a tire!  I had to watch this scene 5 or 6 times alone.  If the idea of a group of madmen(who you know aren't paid squat!) sacrificing life and limb for some of the most incredible stunts put to celluloid sounds like it would be up your alley, then this is a must see!  However, if the usual stuff like plot, dialogue, believability, character development, etc., is what you're after then you should probably pass on this one.  Dan Chupong is solid as the lead, not so much in the acting department, but he can definately fight(and this is an action movie so...).  He looks and fights similair to Tony Jaa(he's been Jaa's stunt double I think) but isn't quite up to his level of charisma or skill... but how many these days really are?!  As far as actual martial arts goes there isn't a ton, but what is here is quality stuff for the most part... although some of the other athletes fight scenes were groan worthy(if the character played soccer for instance he would fight by kicking random things at the villians?!).  The movie is probably closer to deserving a 3 star rating but I enjoyed it so much I had to give it the extra star(plus the STUNTS!).  Filmed by the same crew that brought us both Ong Bak and The Protector, the camera work has the same stylish and exciting feel and the entire film is really polished and feels like it has a far bigger budget than it actually does.

The leading actor just does not have the appeal that Tony Jaa has.The basic plot is a delegation of the Thai sports' team comes to a small village to provide goodwill. The village is overrun by terrorists, who then bring a nuclear missile into the village.  After half the village is wiped out by the terrorists, they and the delegation are taken to the middle of the village.  After hearing a Thai song/anthem, the whole village is inspired to attack the terrorists.The movie starts off well, and has some crazy action with 2 semi-trucks and a van.  When I was watching the film, I was amazed how some of the actors did not get killed or permanently injured.  During the credits, they show  how some of the stunts are done.  Some of the actors did get hurt, and one guy almost had his head taken off.  As someone said in a review, those guys better have had some serious medical insurance or signed a death waiver!The movie did slow down in the middle, but definitely picked up at the end.

1030512,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B000K2V7DW,Mantis,"[2, 2]","This flick starts well enough:  In Thailand, an undercover cop (Dan Chupong, ""Dynamite Warrior"") busts a drug kingpin and loses his friend and partner in the process.  While lamenting, he decides to accompany his gymnast sister, and some other athletes, to an economically-challenged village for a charity event.  While there, a group of paramilitary terrorists take over the village, kill large amounts of its residents, and demand the release of the dude that Chupong just put away.  Eventually realizing that they will all be killed, the villagers unite to try and overthrow their captors, completely ignoring their impulses toward the Stockholm Syndrome.Now if there are good fights and stunts, I can usually handle stupid.  The final 3rd of the movie is ALL action... and couldn't be more boring.  Nearly 30 minutes of face kicking, gun fighting, explosions, and vehicle crashes, 97% of which is in slow-motion, accompanied by guitar-tinged music ripped off from ""The Matrix"".  I guess it wasn't enough to dispense with what little logic it had left.  I'd be a liar if I said that there aren't moments of ""ooh...ahhh..."", but its so ridiculous, and ridiculously done that nearly all entertainment value is jettisoned.This is easily the worst film I've seen that Dragon Dynasty has released, though I have yet to catch ""Dragon Heat"" and ""Dog Bite Dog"".  I've heard (from sources I trust) that those are even worse.  Be that as it is, I love Dragon Dynasty, and for what they've done with Asian cinema for us North American fans, I'll always be grateful.Picture quality is widescreen and excellent, as we've come to expect from DD.

The 1986 version contains a special feature Tony Jaa talking about why he liked the movie and how it influenced him, as well as a spoof of ong bak, with the 1986 film.  The 2004 is a more lean and mean movie, released by Dragon Dynasty, with different special features.  Make sure you know what you're getting before you pruchase it.With the 2004 version, I will review.  I thought the action sequences were amazing.  I'm always shocked the lengths someone will go for a stunt.  This, like Ong Bak, is showing a growing trend among loosing the unreality and CG in favor of more real action.  The trouble is the plot is rather bland, and goes no where.  However, if you liked the protector, and could get past the ""where's my elephant?"" storyline, then this shouldn't phase you too much.

The story is not worth going over.  The only reason to watch this movie is for the amazing stunts and full contact fights.  Maybe Panna was just mad at these guys in real life, but he seriously beats them down hard in the movie.  And look out for one of the craziest motorcycle stunts you will ever see.3/5Movie is full screen but picture quality is decent.  It is better quality than the Thai VCD.Special features on this disc include a 15 minute interview with Tony Jaa and Panna.  It is basically Jaa's life story.  One heck of a special feature.My favorite feature is the 35 minute documentary on what it takes to be one of Panna's stuntmen.The 4 minute interview with a producer of many Panna films could have been longer, but is still informative.The last 2 special features are an Ong-Bak spoof commercial and an odd 13 minute Saturday Night Live type Ong-Bak skit.If you get this movie at a certain store with the initials BB, it comes with a bonus movie, Thai Police Story.  I don't know the Thai name, but it is the one where Panna is fighting 4 guys on a moving truck and one guy gets thrown into a Pepsi billboard.
