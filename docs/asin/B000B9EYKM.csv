938308,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B000B9EYKM,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 0]","On December 14, 1993 John Hiatt came to Austin City Limits in support of his Perfectly Good Guitar album. With him were the Guilty Dogs: Davey Faragher (bass), Michael Urbano (drums) and Michael Ward (guitars) and for the next ninety minutes the audience was treated to pure Hiatt magic from the sparse Icy Blue Heart and Have A Little Faith In Me to the rocking Slow Turning the show highlighted his catalogue to that point.This is the entire concert that was edited into the thirty minute television broadcast. Looking back Hiatt comes off a little goofy and the dancing has got to stop but the music is dead on perfect. The disc is worth the price just for the terrific rendition of Buffalo River Home.I watched with the DTS audio mix and the clarity was very good for an almost 15 year old television show. If the rest of the Austin City Limits videos are this well done this will be a concert DVD series to pay attention to.If you like Hiatt's music or are just curious this one is well worth the money.",4,Great Night of Songwriting and Storytelling,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,1008,"['December', '14', '1993', 'John', 'Hiatt', 'came', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'support', 'Perfectly', 'Good', 'Guitar', 'album', 'were', 'Guilty', 'Dogs', 'Davey', 'Faragher', 'bass', 'Michael', 'Urbano', 'drums', 'Michael', 'Ward', 'guitars', 'next', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'audience', 'was', 'treated', 'pure', 'Hiatt', 'magic', 'sparse', 'Icy', 'Blue', 'Heart', 'Have', 'Little', 'Faith', 'Me', 'rocking', 'Slow', 'Turning', 'show', 'highlighted', 'catalogue', 'point.This', 'entire', 'concert', 'was', 'edited', 'thirty', 'minute', 'television', 'broadcast', 'Looking', 'back', 'Hiatt', 'off', 'little', 'goofy', 'dancing', 'got', 'stop', 'music', 'dead', 'perfect', 'disc', 'price', 'just', 'terrific', 'rendition', 'Buffalo', 'River', 'Home.I', 'watched', 'DTS', 'audio', 'mix', 'clarity', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'almost', '15', 'year', 'old', 'television', 'show', 'rest', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'videos', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'will', 'be', 'concert', 'DVD', 'series', 'pay', 'attention', 'like', 'Hiatt', 'music', 'are', 'just', 'curious', 'one', 'well', 'money']",N/A

John of course is very loose and kinda goofy acting at times, but the music is anything but goofy. This guy is truely passionate about his music and looks like he having a good time performing.

938312,A1TP2RW7KDI5AZ,B000B9EYKM,"John Werner ""JWW""","[0, 0]","Simply put, this is one of the finest Austin City Limits shows ever!  John Haitt is an American songwriter nonparaleil and here he is with the Guilty Dogs who are totally up to the task and sympathetic to the passion of his musical vision.  For a Americana (forI lack of better definition) songwriter Haitt's songs speak simple truths that have a unique power to cut to the bone.  What makes the whole affair even better are they rock out with abandon.  Sure Haitt mugs it up, but it is all part of his passion and you have got to love it in the end because he delivers.  It's hard to not give superlatives to The Guilty Dogs as they are, perhaps, the most perfect 3-piece backing musicians Haitt has ever put together.  Add to this the truly excellent audio mixing/recording that has made it to disc on this set with bright and clear video editing that is a textbook example of how a concert can be presented with excitement less edit-nervosa and what you got is the perfect Haitt concert.  This is a rare gift and if anyone is a Haitt fan this is an absolute must buy.

Hiatt is a little long in the tooth (and this is 12 years ago) to be dancing like a hoosier hick whose kids are hiding. And the rest of the band could give Tom Petty and his mob a run in the dead-ugly department. but who really cares if you keep the tube off and just listen.The sound quality is excellent. So is the video, if you can stand it. (Prince he ain't - in fact he should take serious notes from Will Smith in Hitch about men dancing). The crowd got one if the real stand out performances from anybody on that show and it rocks start to finish. This one and Richard Thompson's set are brilliant. Where's Neil and the International Harvesters? Likely hell will freeze over before Shakey lets that out of the can. Anyway for Hiatt, this is a triumph. His material is terrific and he leaps thumps into it with enthusiasm. Absolutely worth the price.

938316,A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S,B000B9EYKM,Thomas E. Davis,"[1, 1]","John Hiatt gives a fantastic performance from the first note to the last: fiery, funny, and flat-out fun.His young band, The Guilty Dogs, matches his energy and virtuosity, especially Michael Ward on guitar, but the endlessly expressive Hiatt is the unquestioned center of this 1993 show. He's completely switched on, goofing and mugging for the audience, whispering, growling, and howling, dancing like a man possessed, playing and singing some of his best songs in a brilliant blend of styles, including folk, country, rock, and funk. You can't take your eyes off him as he rips through 14 great tunes (and the few that weren't hits deserved to be).Hiatt is well-known for being a songwriter's songwriter, but his delivery puts the seal on the deal. His versions of ""Loving a Hurricane,"" ""When You Hold Me Tight,"" ""Memphis In the Meantime,"" ""Something Wild,"" ""Buffalo River Home,"" ""Thing Called Love,"" ""Tennessee Plates,"" and ""Slow Turning"" are positively irresistible. He closes with ""Perfectly Good Guitar,"" the title track of the marvelous album that this tour supported. Though he threatens to smash his own guitar, he fortunately changes his mind and ends up rocking it like a baby in his arms.His dedications are as cockeyed as his lyrics: to Marilyn (a high school crush who never gave him the time of day), to Anita Rodgers Court (late daughter of country music founder Jimmy Rodgers), to Bonnie Raitt (for ""keeping tires on the old tour bus""), and even to Barry White (a label-mate who told Hiatt, ""If you don't go slow, you got no show."") But he plays only two slow numbers, the soulful opener ""Icy Blue Heart"" on guitar and ""Have a Little Faith in Me"" on keyboard, both solo. They're every bit as thrilling as the remaining dozen songs, which are all barn-burners.Credit is due to the typically terrific Austin City Limits production crew, whose immaculate sound and camerawork give you Hiatt up close and at full volume.I admit I'm a raving fan, but this 84-minute DVD will make you one even if you're not. You'll want to play it again immediately and wish it were twice as long.",5,Pardon me for raving,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,2093,"['John', 'Hiatt', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'first', 'note', 'last', 'fiery', 'funny', 'flat-out', 'fun.His', 'young', 'band', 'Guilty', 'Dogs', 'energy', 'virtuosity', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Ward', 'guitar', 'endlessly', 'expressive', 'Hiatt', 'unquestioned', 'center', '1993', 'show', 'completely', 'switched', 'goofing', 'mugging', 'audience', 'whispering', 'growling', 'howling', 'dancing', 'man', 'possessed', 'playing', 'singing', 'best', 'songs', 'brilliant', 'blend', 'styles', 'including', 'folk', 'country', 'rock', 'funk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'off', '14', 'great', 'tunes', 'few', 'were', ""n't"", 'hits', 'deserved', 'be', '.Hiatt', 'well-known', 'being', 'songwriter', 'songwriter', 'delivery', 'seal', 'deal', 'versions', 'Loving', 'Hurricane', 'When', 'Hold', 'Me', 'Tight', 'Memphis', 'Meantime', 'Something', 'Wild', 'Buffalo', 'River', 'Home', 'Thing', 'Called', 'Love', 'Tennessee', 'Plates', 'Slow', 'Turning', 'are', 'positively', 'irresistible', 'Perfectly', 'Good', 'Guitar', 'title', 'track', 'marvelous', 'album', 'tour', 'supported', 'smash', 'own', 'guitar', 'fortunately', 'mind', 'up', 'rocking', 'baby', 'arms.His', 'dedications', 'are', 'as', 'cockeyed', 'lyrics', 'Marilyn', 'high', 'school', 'crush', 'who', 'never', 'gave', 'time', 'day', 'Anita', 'Rodgers', 'Court', 'late', 'daughter', 'country', 'music', 'founder', 'Jimmy', 'Rodgers', 'Bonnie', 'Raitt', 'keeping', 'tires', 'old', 'tour', 'bus', 'even', 'Barry', 'White', 'label-mate', 'who', 'told', 'Hiatt', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'slow', 'got', 'show', 'only', 'two', 'slow', 'numbers', 'soulful', 'opener', 'Icy', 'Blue', 'Heart', 'guitar', 'Have', 'Little', 'Faith', 'Me', 'keyboard', 'solo', ""'re"", 'bit', 'as', 'thrilling', 'remaining', 'dozen', 'songs', 'are', 'barn-burners.Credit', 'due', 'typically', 'terrific', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'production', 'crew', 'immaculate', 'sound', 'camerawork', 'give', 'Hiatt', 'up', 'close', 'full', 'volume.I', 'admit', ""'m"", 'raving', 'fan', '84-minute', 'DVD', 'will', 'make', 'one', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', ""'ll"", 'want', 'play', 'again', 'immediately', 'wish', 'were', 'twice', 'as', 'long']",N/A
