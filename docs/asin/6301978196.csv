Maybe if I had seen this movie when it first opened I might have enjoyed it. This film, I'm guessing was probably some sort of ""wild sex farce"", but, some of the scenes seem average by today's standards. But, I just think this movie is awful. There's no getting around it. The directing by Clive Donner is awful. It seems as if he just told everyone, ""OK, go do what you like, meanwhile, I'll be here taking a nap. Wake if something exciting happens."" I've heard some backstage rumors about this movie, and most of them are true. The producers, including Charles K. Feldman, gave Donner nothing but trouble. Always over his shoulder telling HIM what to do! The film editing by Fergus McDonell (don't ask me who he is) is awful as well. He's sorta jump cutting from one scene to another for no other reason than, there's no joke around, so let's quite while we're ahead. He's just cutting scenes, in a way butchering the movie. Now, everyone on here says this movie is funny. Well is this movie funny? Yes, it is. True, it doesn't have the Woody Allen touch that would come in his later films, but, afterall this was his first time as a screenwriter. There are some great lines in this movie like an exchange between Michael James (Peter O' Toole) and his school teacher, after they share a kiss.Teacher:Oh,Michael, this can't work! I'm 34 and you're 12!Michael: Don't be negative!Or an agrument between Dr. Fritz Fassbender (Peter Sellers) and his wife. She thinks he is cheating on her.Wife: Is she prettier than me?Fritz: Is she prettier than you! I AM prettier than you!So, yes, this film does have it's share of laughs,but, the movie in whole is just a big,over-blown film. That has too many characters, and too many ideas to make it into a good comedy. I understand this was suppose to be a wild sex comedy, but this movie isn't silly in a funny way. It becomes silly in an annoying way. It even gets a bit boring around the middle, and some argue it goes on too long. There are nice performances by the ""late"" Capucine & Romy Scheider. Paula Prentiss is amusing as well. And, even though she's fun to look at, there is no need for Ursula Andress in this movie! Peter Sellers look absolutely ridiculous. He looks and sounds like kermit the frog! The ONLY real importance I feel this movie has is, it introduced the American public to Woody Allen (And yes that's a good thing lol). There have been so many stories about what went on while making this movie, it's a wonder it was even made at all! It's said that Feldman offered some words of wisdom to Allen. To sorta guide him. His intelligent words were: ""Write something where we can all go to Paris and meet some women!"" How is that not inspiring lol? The ending scene is something that the creative minds of Laurel&Hardy;, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, and the Ritz Brothers would of thought of! That should just give you a sample of what to expect when watching this movie. As I said besides giving us Woody Allen this film has very little to offer. The movie was up for one Oscar, ""Best Song"" ""What's New Pussycat"", which might be the only other good thing about this film.p.s. If you really enjoyed this movie, maybe you'll like ""Casino Royale"". Which reteams many of the same people that were in this in that movie.

287333,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,6301978196,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 1]","""What's new,Pussycat?"" is from back in the day when sex comedies had some brains to them, relying more on double entendres than anything graphic. Forget the crudeness of the American Pie&head; to France in the '60s instead! This movie is indeed trippin'. You'll have to suspend your disbelief. It was the '60s.From its opening,""What's new Pussycat?"" has a very psychedelic sense. Peter Sellers stars as a German psychiatrist who's a proto-Austin Powers. Somehow he manages to be a womanizer,dress in maroon velvet like Prince,and wear a wig that's--impressive. Peter O'Toole stars as Michael James,an astoundingly heterosexual editor of a women's fashion magazine&exudes; an aura of such sex appeal that women pursue him relentlessly. After the success of ""Lawrence of Arabia"",O'Toole was almost a sex symbol. This movie attempted to capitalize on it. A tall,nervous,frequently drunk Irishman as a sex god-well,it was the '60s. His frequent shirtlessness gives this movie three stars rather than two. Finally,Woody Allen stars as a nebbish man working in a strip club.The plot to ""What's new Pussycat?"" can be described as trippin' at best. Peter Sellers is a psychiatrist cheating on his wife. Michael James has a fiancee,but wants to ""experiment"" and frequents strip clubs to find love (Richard Burton also makes a cameo appearance) James recounts his amorous conquests from the age of 12 onward. Sellers tries to seduce a lady (only to be chased by gendarmes) James finds himself with a virginal stripper who reads poetry. And so on..... The plot (along with the scenery&costumes;) is psychedelic&meant; to be that way.""What's up Pussycat?"" is a sex comedy that's actually quite funny,in its own bizarre way. It's deemed politically incorrect now,and back when it first opened American movie critics lambasted it as immoral&decadent.; Not much has changed. Still,it's an opportunity to see Lawrence of Arabia,Ladies' Man! Enjoy!

287335,A20IIR0422G3A5,6301978196,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 2]","'What's New Pussycat' offers enormous promise in its lineup of acting and writing talents from Peter Sellers, Peter O'Toole, Woody Allen, Romy Schneider, Capucine, and for great eyewash, Ursala Andress. Overall, the movie is a farce which pretends to be more 'intelligent' than the many early farcical movies it copies. I suspect Allen conceived a plan to see how many different movie comedies he could 'quote'. I detect 'borrowings' from the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and W. C. Fields, not to mention Allen's own early movie persona. Add to that Peter Sellers' comic tics and you get a highly spiced mix of styles, devices, and plot twists. But there lies the problem. To sense the extent to which the film goes wrong, one can compare it to two very successful farces. The first is none other than William Shakespeare's first play, 'Two Gentlemen of Verona', based on disguise and mistaken identies. The other is the French movie and its American translation, 'The Birdcage', also based on a comedy of errors and mistaken identities. Both work quite well, simply because they are far simpler in plot. '...Pussycat' reminds me of a line from 'Amadeus' where Mozart is bragging about how many parts he introduces into a passage in one of his operas, reaching, I believe 20, an unheard of number to be sure. Allen concocts a plot based on the swings in relationships between three male characters (Sellers, O'Toole, and Allen) and at least five female characters. While he doesn't realize all possible combinations (15), he comes close. To continue the culinary metaphor, the story and its manic realization, there is simply just too many dispirate things going to appreciate any distinct tastes at all. It is either entirely too sickly sweet to appreciate the inndividual flavors. And, it is not that Allen goes to far in stretching our ability to suspend disbelief. Some of the greatest comedies by far stretch reality far, far beyond the breaking point, such as 'Ghostbusters' and 'Blazing Saddles'. There is no sense of uniform style or approach. Allen's scenes are clearly written by 'Woody Allen', but Sellers' scenes seem to be written by Blake Edwards. The whole movie seems like its put together like Sellars' bizzare Tutor house seen in the opening scene. This movie is by far less than the sum of its parts. One of the greatest examples of how moments are simply thrown in for cheap effect is the cameo appearance of Richard Burton in a scene with O'Toole. Amazingly enough, there is value in watching the movie at least once, especially if you are old enough to remember the culture of the early sixties, just before things got really crazy. I will even go so far as to say the movie is rich enough to warrent two or three viewings, especially with a group of people with similar tastes for Allen and Sellars. This movie is also a refutation of the opinion that all Allen's earlier movies were better than his later films.",4,"Fabulous Talents, Disappointing Movie",1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,2969,"['New', 'Pussycat', 'offers', 'enormous', 'promise', 'lineup', 'acting', 'writing', 'talents', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Romy', 'Schneider', 'Capucine', 'great', 'eyewash', 'Ursala', 'Andress', 'Overall', 'movie', 'farce', 'be', 'more', ""'intelligent"", 'many', 'early', 'farcical', 'movies', 'suspect', 'Allen', 'conceived', 'plan', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'different', 'movie', 'comedies', 'could', ""'quote"", 'detect', ""'borrowings"", 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'W.', 'C.', 'Fields', 'not', 'mention', 'Allen', 'own', 'early', 'movie', 'persona', 'Add', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'comic', 'tics', 'get', 'highly', 'spiced', 'mix', 'styles', 'devices', 'plot', 'twists', 'problem', 'sense', 'extent', 'film', 'wrong', 'one', 'can', 'compare', 'two', 'very', 'successful', 'farces', 'first', 'none', 'other', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'first', 'play', 'Gentlemen', 'Verona', 'based', 'disguise', 'mistaken', 'identies', 'other', 'French', 'movie', 'American', 'translation', 'Birdcage', 'also', 'based', 'comedy', 'errors', 'mistaken', 'identities', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'simply', 'are', 'far', 'simpler', 'plot', 'Pussycat', 'reminds', 'line', ""'Amadeus"", 'where', 'Mozart', 'bragging', 'how', 'many', 'parts', 'passage', 'one', 'operas', 'reaching', 'believe', '20', 'unheard', 'number', 'be', 'sure', 'Allen', 'plot', 'based', 'swings', 'relationships', 'three', 'male', 'characters', 'Sellers', ""O'Toole"", 'Allen', 'least', 'five', 'female', 'characters', ""n't"", 'realize', 'possible', 'combinations', '15', 'close', 'continue', 'culinary', 'metaphor', 'story', 'manic', 'realization', 'simply', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'dispirate', 'things', 'going', 'appreciate', 'distinct', 'tastes', 'entirely', 'too', 'sickly', 'sweet', 'appreciate', 'inndividual', 'flavors', 'not', 'Allen', 'far', 'stretching', 'ability', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'greatest', 'comedies', 'far', 'stretch', 'reality', 'far', 'far', 'breaking', 'point', 'such', ""'Ghostbusters"", ""'Blazing"", 'Saddles', 'sense', 'uniform', 'style', 'approach', 'Allen', 'scenes', 'are', 'clearly', 'written', ""'Woody"", 'Allen', 'Sellers', 'scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'written', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'whole', 'movie', 'put', 'together', 'Sellars', 'bizzare', 'Tutor', 'house', 'seen', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'far', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'One', 'greatest', 'examples', 'how', 'moments', 'are', 'simply', 'thrown', 'cheap', 'effect', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'scene', ""O'Toole"", 'Amazingly', 'enough', 'value', 'watching', 'movie', 'least', 'once', 'especially', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'culture', 'early', 'sixties', 'just', 'things', 'got', 'really', 'crazy', 'will', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'movie', 'rich', 'enough', 'warrent', 'two', 'three', 'viewings', 'especially', 'group', 'people', 'similar', 'tastes', 'Allen', 'Sellars', 'movie', 'also', 'refutation', 'opinion', 'Allen', 'earlier', 'movies', 'were', 'better', 'later', 'films']",What's New Pussycat VHS

287338,A14IY5HCINZWT0,6301978196,Damien D. Mecoles,"[5, 14]","What's New Pussycat is a dubious start for the great Woody Allan, but it is an important film because after this disaster was released Woody vowed to never let anyone again direct a film he had written.  What's New Pussycat starts off with a lot of promise.  The animated titles with the song of the same name as the film sung by a young Tom Jones sets you up for a fun time.  The opening scene with Peter Seller's as a mad psychiatrist fighting his Wagnarian wife is very funny.  Then What's New Pussycat goes off the rails.  Scenes of two drunks slurring their words and staggering around waking up the neighborhood are slow, boring and as unfunny as the real thing.  Peter O Toole and Peter Sellers just go through the motions.  The scenes with Woody Allan are good, but these moments don't really fit the film.  What's New Pussycat goes about an hour too long.Although the director clearly focusses his attention on madcap lunacy rather than the plot, it is interesting to wonder what Woody actually intended What's New Pussycat to be.  The film as it stands is so different to anything else he worked on (disregarding Casino Royale, because his input on that was minimal).  If he had directed this film I suspect scenes would have been tightened, the dialogue more realistically delivered, the slapstick would have been staggered and not overwhelm everything else, and Peter Sellers, if he had any respect for Woody as a first time director (which is doubtful), may have beem induced to really shine.

The film's virtues include O'Toole's account of a womanizer trying to reform his ways.  O'Toole has a deft touch for the broad comedy he's asked to tackle here.

While I am currently in my mid-20s, I often say I grew up on Woody Allen films, often renting old ones on VHS and always seeing new ones in the theaters. However, the bottom line is that I was not particularly happy with this one.This is Woody's film debut and he is not the director, however he is the writer and there is no doubt of that as this movie feels like a something only the mind of Woody Allen can conjure up. In this sense, Woody Allen fans should enjoy it, I did in this respect. I also enjoyed the fact that Sellers and O'Toole were in this film, however I did not think much of Sellers' performance. I was also surprised to see how young and handsome O'Toole was. I hate to say it (and this has nothing to do with the film itself) but as I saw O'Toole in his recent film, ""Venus"", I thought he must of been in his 80's. It seems he is actually 75, only three years older than Allen, who by the way looks great.This film feels more like a play at times, which is actually quite endearing.  I do admit I wholeheartedly enjoyed Sellers and O'Toole's as drunkards, Woody Allen fighting off a giant, the psychoanalysis get-togethers, Burt Bacharach's score...boy, it seems the more I discuss the film the more I realize how much I actually liked it.Well, perhaps one more sour note to even things out.

(1965) was directed by a British director, Clive Donner and it is the first feature film for which Woody Allen wrote the original screenplay. Allen also played a supporting role of Victor Skakapopulis, the friend of Michael James (Peter O'Toole). Michael is a fashion editor, surrounded by beauty and glamour of his models which he can't refuse. He truly loves his fianc&eacute;e Carole (Romy Schneider) and wants to be faithful to her but what can a man do if the gorgeous women literally fell for him from the sky? He sees a psychoanalyst Dr. Fassbender (Peter Sellers) who is not much of help and faces his own demons. Meanwhile, Victor is desperately in love with his best friend's fianc&eacute;e...The movie reminds a lot ""Casino Royale"" - it was made in the 60s, has a great cast (Peter Sellers, Peter O'Toole, Romy Schneider, Capucine, Paula Prentiss, Woody Allen, Ursula Andress), strikingly beautiful women and the song by Burt Bacharach. It takes place in Paris - and it is almost as much mess as ""Casino... "" is - silly, naive, and often simply ridiculous but somehow it works after all these years. One of the reasons I believe is Allen's script, the dialogues and one-liners that are hilarious. This time, Allen received more screen time that in Casino.... and he made his scenes very funny.

Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 4]","WHAT'S NEW, PUSSYCAT? was a popular ticket in 1965--but when seen outside the context of its era it emerges as a slightly choppy, slightly slapdash film long on froth and short on actual amusement.Originally written by Woody Allen as a vehicle for Warren Beatty, both script and cast underwent a mighty change before it reached the screen, so much so that the experience prompted Allen to swear he'd never allow any one but himself to direct one of his scripts in the future.  The story revolves around Michael James (Peter O'Toole), a handsome man who wants to marry Carol (Romy Schneider) but can't stop sleeping around long enough to make a commitment.  He accordingly goes to psychiatrist Dr. Fritz Fassbender (Peter Sellers)--who is a sex-crazed nut in pursuit of patient Renee (Capucine.)  Before the dust settles Woody Allen, Paula Prentiss, Ursla Andress, and Edra Gale are added to the mix.O'Toole and Sellers are hardly challenged by the material and Allen introduces his ""I'm a New York neurotic"" screen persona for the first time--but it is really the abundance of supporting actresses that give the film what little zing it still retains.  Romy Schnieder was among Europe's greatest stars and finest actresses of her era; although the script offers her little, she is charming indeed.  Much the same can be said of the legendary Capucine in the role of a world-weary nymphomaniac; Ursula Andress, who arrives in the film via parachute, and bovine Edra Gale, who runs riot in Wagnerian attire.  But the real scene stealer is Paula Prentiss.Although extremely attractive, Prentiss was originally typed as a ""second lead"" of the Eve Arden type--but she quickly graduated to neurotic comedy roles for which she had a truly unique flair.  WHAT'S NEW, PUSSYCAT? finds her at the top of her form as the interestingly-named Liz Bien, who writes bad poetry, has a tendency to overdose on pills everytime she goes to the bathroom, and who attaches herself to the much-harrassed Peter O'Toole.  It really is a performance that transcends the material and which lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.The DVD release is third rate, with mediocre visual elements and sound so uneven that I constantly adjusted the volume as I watched.  When all is said and done, this is really a film for hardcore fans of its various stars--and especially for Paula Prentiss.  If for no other reason, the film is worth watching for her alone.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Paula Prentiss Steals The Show,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,2455,"['WHAT', 'NEW', 'PUSSYCAT', 'was', 'popular', 'ticket', '1965', 'when', 'seen', 'context', 'era', 'slightly', 'choppy', 'slightly', 'slapdash', 'film', 'long', 'froth', 'short', 'actual', 'amusement.Originally', 'written', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'vehicle', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'script', 'cast', 'underwent', 'mighty', 'change', 'reached', 'screen', 'so', 'much', 'experience', 'prompted', 'Allen', 'swear', ""'d"", 'never', 'allow', 'one', 'direct', 'one', 'scripts', 'future', 'story', 'Michael', 'James', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'handsome', 'man', 'who', 'marry', 'Carol', 'Romy', 'Schneider', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'sleeping', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'commitment', 'accordingly', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Fritz', 'Fassbender', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'who', 'sex-crazed', 'nut', 'pursuit', 'patient', 'Renee', 'Capucine', 'dust', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'Ursla', 'Andress', 'Edra', 'Gale', 'are', 'added', ""mix.O'Toole"", 'Sellers', 'are', 'hardly', 'challenged', 'material', 'Allen', ""'m"", 'New', 'York', 'neurotic', 'screen', 'persona', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'abundance', 'supporting', 'actresses', 'give', 'film', 'what', 'zing', 'still', 'Romy', 'Schnieder', 'was', 'Europe', 'greatest', 'stars', 'finest', 'actresses', 'era', 'script', 'little', 'charming', 'indeed', 'Much', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'legendary', 'Capucine', 'role', 'world-weary', 'nymphomaniac', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'who', 'film', 'parachute', 'bovine', 'Edra', 'Gale', 'who', 'riot', 'Wagnerian', 'attire', 'real', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Paula', 'Prentiss.Although', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'Prentiss', 'was', 'originally', 'typed', 'second', 'lead', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'type', 'quickly', 'graduated', 'neurotic', 'comedy', 'roles', 'had', 'truly', 'unique', 'flair', 'WHAT', 'NEW', 'PUSSYCAT', 'top', 'form', 'interestingly-named', 'Liz', 'Bien', 'who', 'bad', 'poetry', 'tendency', 'overdose', 'pills', 'everytime', 'bathroom', 'who', 'much-harrassed', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'really', 'performance', 'material', 'lingers', 'mind', 'long', 'credits', 'roll.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'third', 'rate', 'mediocre', 'visual', 'elements', 'sound', 'so', 'uneven', 'constantly', 'adjusted', 'volume', 'watched', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'really', 'film', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'various', 'stars', 'especially', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'other', 'reason', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",What's New Pussycat VHS

For once I agree with the Amazon staff reviewer, it wasn't as funny as it should/could have been.  Hell, it wasn't funny at all!  According to the Amazon reviewer, Allen's script was rewritten (let some washroom executive try a stunt like that today!), and that probably accounts for the tedium.  It had a clever (kind of) premise, and probably would have been funny if Allen's script had been left in tact and if it hadn't been nearly 2 hours long.

This year I decided to work my way through all of Woody Allen's movies, from earliest to latest.  And, as ""What's New, Pussycat?"" seems to be the first of the Allen-driven movies (Allen didn't direct it, but he wrote it and is one of its stars), here's where I began!  It's the fault of Leonard Maltin's movie guide if I should have started somewhere else.  Anyway, onward...This is a fun little movie, though it's strange seeing Woody in what is essentially a goofy British comedy-- complete with Peter Sellers, no less!  Alas, the movie is about twenty minutes too long and a little choppy in its story-telling.  But there are some genuine laughs, though they're more along the lines of an occasional chuckle than the frequent guffaws variety.In the end, though I had some fun discovering this movie (this is one of the few Woody Allen films I had never seen) I have to say that my initial impression during the closing credits was that Woody's better days were definitely ahead of him.  Of course, I'm sure the movie's shortcomings weren't totally his fault, as at that point in his career Woody likely didn't have total control of the final product.I'd say that ""What's New, Pussycat"" is worth viewing half for its inherent merits and half for the historic curiosity of its being Woody's first feature-film appearance.  An amusing postscript:  Woody's recent ""Match Point"" was also filmed in England, making that country the host of both an early, somewhat floundering work of an emerging talent and the mature, accomplished work of a master director.",3,Woody Allen in a go-cart chase?,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1633,"['year', 'try', 'have', 'bit', 'fun', 'give', 'DVD', 'viewing', 'project', 'year', 'decided', 'work', 'way', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'earliest', 'latest', 'What', 'New', 'Pussycat', 'be', 'first', 'Allen-driven', 'movies', 'Allen', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'wrote', 'one', 'stars', 'here', 'where', 'began', 'fault', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'movie', 'guide', 'should', 'have', 'started', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Anyway', 'onward', 'fun', 'little', 'movie', 'strange', 'seeing', 'Woody', 'what', 'essentially', 'goofy', 'British', 'comedy', 'complete', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'less', 'Alas', 'movie', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'little', 'choppy', 'story-telling', 'are', 'genuine', 'laughs', ""'re"", 'more', 'lines', 'occasional', 'chuckle', 'frequent', 'guffaws', 'end', 'had', 'fun', 'discovering', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'have', 'say', 'initial', 'impression', 'closing', 'credits', 'was', 'Woody', 'better', 'days', 'were', 'definitely', 'ahead', 'course', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'shortcomings', 'were', ""n't"", 'totally', 'fault', 'point', 'career', 'Woody', 'likely', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'total', 'control', 'final', 'product.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'What', 'New', 'Pussycat', 'worth', 'viewing', 'half', 'inherent', 'merits', 'half', 'historic', 'curiosity', 'being', 'Woody', 'first', 'feature-film', 'appearance', 'amusing', 'postscript', 'Woody', 'recent', 'Match', 'Point', 'was', 'also', 'filmed', 'England', 'making', 'country', 'host', 'early', 'somewhat', 'floundering', 'work', 'emerging', 'talent', 'mature', 'accomplished', 'work', 'master', 'director']",What's New Pussycat VHS

He's at his outrageous best (or worst) in WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT, and sometimes that isn't very pretty.  Peter O'Toole plays off of him well, O'Toole is smooth like double malt scotch, and as for Woody Allen, it's hard to believe he won many fans with his antics here.  He's much better in CASINO ROYALE, not to mention his own films.  WNPC has a lot of zany, 60s, pop energy flying through it, the sets are lighter than air (bar the Chateau Chantel which looks as though it's made of stone) and much of the dialogue seems improvised by a knowing cast.Capucine has been unfairly reviewed for her part in WNPC, for it is obvious that she was shoved into the movie at the last minute, probably on Feldman's say-so, since she had become his mistress.  Yet she did better for herself, I think, before she knew him, kind of like the way Maria Callas was probably better off before becoming Onassis's pawn.  She was one of the underused actresses in the early 60s, not a great time for women in general, and her statuesque good looks got her typed as a kind of chic accessory, not an actress at all, more like the ""supermodels"" of today.  Perhaps having only one name didn't help her either, it makes the audience think twice all right but it makes you into a freak.  Like ""Cher"" or ""Twiggy.""  Anyway Capucine has long been thought of as the weak link in What's New Pussycat, but that's just a swipe at a dead woman who's not here to defend herself.Paula Prentiss is wonderful as the poet slash stripper.  As Burt Bacharach's theme music goes, ""Stripping Really Isn't Sexy, Is It?""  Her poetry is amusing too, I wonder if Woody Allen wrote it for her, it sounds like San Francisco circa 1962 which is when Allen lived here and hung out with all the beat poets and their entourages. He got his big break at the Purple Onion in North Beach, often sharing the stage with Barbra Streisand and Lenny Bruce.  But the poets revered him for his verbal acuity and his surrealist bent, his way of turning everything upside down during JFK's shortlived ""New Frontier.""Romy Schneider is exquisite, and Ursula Andress charming in her little Kangol-style newsboy cap.  This new DVD is disappointingly thin on extras, and unfortunately has none of the scenes that its real fans just know must be somewhere around, for with such a slapdash and carefree pictures, the deleted scenes must be high on the ground!

287355,AZW2868HYUPZO,6301978196,"Leon Alvarado ""movie connoisseur""","[7, 9]","Typical of the comedies of the time, the movie centers in two characters and a whole of insane situations that ocurr as they get engaged to marry each other. O'toole's character is the editor of a fashion magazine who has a hard time of giving up his carefree life for one of committment, (that much hasn't changed with new films). He seeks help with a psychoanalyst (Peter Sellers) who specializes in the subject. From there the movie takes flight with some not so unexpected twists resulting in a go-cart police chase through the French countryside. Growing up with it, this movie is one of my favorite comedies. Peter O'toole and Peter Sellers do some extremely funny work in this 60's era movie. The suporting cast includes the introduction of a very funny Woody Allen as well as some notable performances by Romy Schneider, Paula Prentiss and some good 'ol eye candy in Ursula Andress. The dialogue is well written and the balance between physical and situational comedy make this movie a very enjoyable experience, specially for those who grew up in the sixties. Burt Bacarah's music sang by Tom Jones is very nostalgic and reminds me of a time when the depiction of situations still showed certain naivet&eacute; and, to a certain extent, wholesomeness. Not to say that the subject matter of the movie, (sex), is what you want your kids to see, but this movie takes the content lightly and the humor is not as crude as today's films by a long shot.

Everybody is wacky, and there's really nobody to stand as proxy for the audience.

Prior to viewing ""What's New Pussycat?"", I would have presumed that I would enjoy each and every movie.  However, ""What's New Pussycat?"" has shown me that even Woody Allen can make a disaster movie.What is wrong with this movie is just about everything.  The acting can only do so much with an impossibly awful script and a director who seems to want to magnify the faults rather than cover them up.  We start with a man whose problem is that he must seduce every acttractive woman he sees.  Peter O'Toole won the rights to play this character and he is surrounded by beautiful women.  He proceeds to make it all seem so boringly ridiculous.  He calls all his femine friends ""pussycat"" which gets old after a while.  He constantly displays a bewildered expression coupled with a rather interested/disinterested approach toward his playmates.  He seeks the help of a sexually challenged psychiatrist played by Peter Sellers.  Sellers does his best with what little he has to work with.  He has the Dr. Strangelove accent down pretty good and he is constantly on the make but the humor that emerges is so weak as to be embarassing at times.  Woody Allen wrote the script, which is the most shocking disappointment of the whole picture.  I once heard a comedian remark that a good comic writer can give you 10 new jokes of which you can use 3.  With Woody Allen, the comedian said, you can use all 10.  In ""What's New Pussycat?"", I wish there HAD been at least three good jokes.  This overlong look into the problems that O'Toole's character suffers from eventually attempts to save itself with a sort of Bennie Hill-style slapstick.  I take that back; there's no justifiable reason to besmirch the good name of Bennie Hill by associating it with this turkey.  Anyway, the movie ends in a chateau with a sort of musical beds involving all of O'Toole's mistresses.  An incomprehensible brouhaha ensues and the revelers escape to a neighboring go-kart track.  (Presumeably all fashional French Chateaus have a conveniently adjacent go-kart track).  This enables the movie to sink so low that it boggles the mind.

Much of the humor is (and I *hate* the term) politically incorrect by current standards, so beware.For all that, I enjoy it immensely.

It's so easy to pass judgement on distant bits of culture from our high and holy PC Olympus! I imagine if the Puritans had had the opportunity to write movie reviews they'd have had about the same tone.Back in the Sixties (which, oddly, had a history other than that involving Viet Nam, Civil Rights, and Feminism) folks were shaking themselves loose of the straightjacket that had been on them since, at least, the Great Depression, at most, the 13th Century. People wanted fun, color, and wackiness, and they enjoyed getting it. Why else would big no-nonsense film companies interested in profits sink dough into plotless wonders like this film and, say, Casino Royale?This is kind of a fascist age. Folks of all political stripes are into no-compromise black and white ethics. Everyone's got an opinion. Everyone knows what's right for you. A movie like this is just great for those of us who find all this SERIOUSNESS tiresome, just as it was great for our kindred sisters and brothers back in the Sixties who were sick of their parents lecturing them (Nowadays it's our kids that sound like our dopey tight-[censored] parents--how did we let that happen?).
