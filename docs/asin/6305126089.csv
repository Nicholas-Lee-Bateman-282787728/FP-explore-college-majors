The movie has plenty of death defying stunts and humor even if the bad guys are a bit cartoonish (satanic monks with bushy eyebrows) and the plot a bit thin.The back of the cd case calls it a prequel to Operation Condor.  I haven't gotten to watch the latter yet, so can't compare.I deducted another star because as others have pointed out the dvd does not have great features.  I don't mind not having a chinese sound track.  If I want that I can buy a Hong Kong release.  However, I get used to most dvd's having some kind of extra features.

450094,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,6305126089,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 1]","Operation Condor: Armour of The Gods, as you probably are already aware of, is not a sequal to Operation Condor, it was just released later in the U.S. and they decided to put a 2 after it.  Being a U.S. release, you can expect the usual pathetic English dubbing, although a plus is that Jackie Chan actually dubs over his own voice.  This film, along with the other Operation Condor, are sort of Jackie's closest makes at an archeology/adventure type of film.  Though I wouldn't go as far to say it is Indiana Jones, it does have a lot more martial arts than Harrison Ford can obviously provide.I was rather bored with the plot, and it seemed rather lame.  A group of religious men, whose religion is influenced by Lucipher, wishes to become the most powerful group in the world by aquiring and destroying all 5 pieces of the Armour of God.  They learn that Jackie has recently aquired a piece, and kidnap his ex-girlfriend (now his best friend's girl) to lure him in.  There's not much more to the plot other than some chase scenes and the rescue operation of the girl and his best friend from the bad guys.  Jackie also makes it quite clear that good must overcome evil, and he will not let the men succeed with their mission.The films action is great but rather limited.  Don't expect anything like Legend of Drunken Master or Who Am I, but there is still a lot of great classic action that you won't find in today's Chan films.  The beginning scene is great, and reminds me a lot of the beginning scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark when Indiana Jones is running from the natives.  In Armour of the Gods, Jackie slides down a mountainside and the natives follow in special woven one man sleds they made.  There is a great car chase scene in the movie too.  And lastly, the only other noteworthy action scene is the finale, where Jackie takes on a whole room of the evil men followed by their leader's 4 Amazon-like, leathered up women.  Its kinda silly, but the choreography is rather amazing and its at least a solid 4 minute fight scene.This is a Jackie Chan film that remains average overall.  There is some good action, but it occurs infrequently, and the plot is too boring and uninteresting to hold my attention.  There is a great stunt at the conclusion, where Jackie lands on a hot-air balloon, but the camera makes it seem unsure of the height of the balloon off the ground.  Nevertheless, I am sure it something that none of us could ever pull off.  Also, Jackie has a song that is in the soundtrack during the stunt, and he does his own singing.  Unlike the comment in First Strike, he's not as lousy as a singer as I thought.",3,"[3.5] jackie chan is indiana jones, well, not really",1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,2639,"['Operation', 'Condor', 'Armour', 'Gods', 'probably', 'are', 'already', 'aware', 'not', 'sequal', 'Operation', 'Condor', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'later', 'U.S.', 'decided', 'put', '2', 'Being', 'U.S.', 'release', 'can', 'expect', 'usual', 'pathetic', 'English', 'dubbing', 'plus', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'actually', 'own', 'voice', 'film', 'other', 'Operation', 'Condor', 'are', 'sort', 'Jackie', 'closest', 'archeology/adventure', 'type', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'martial', 'arts', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'can', 'obviously', 'provide.I', 'was', 'rather', 'bored', 'plot', 'seemed', 'rather', 'lame', 'group', 'religious', 'men', 'religion', 'influenced', 'Lucipher', 'become', 'most', 'powerful', 'group', 'world', 'aquiring', 'destroying', '5', 'pieces', 'Armour', 'God', 'learn', 'Jackie', 'recently', 'aquired', 'piece', 'kidnap', 'ex-girlfriend', 'now', 'best', 'friend', 'girl', 'lure', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'other', 'chase', 'scenes', 'rescue', 'operation', 'girl', 'best', 'friend', 'bad', 'guys', 'Jackie', 'also', 'quite', 'clear', 'good', 'must', 'overcome', 'evil', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'men', 'succeed', 'mission.The', 'films', 'action', 'great', 'rather', 'limited', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'Legend', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'Who', 'Am', 'still', 'lot', 'great', 'classic', 'action', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'today', 'Chan', 'films', 'beginning', 'scene', 'great', 'lot', 'beginning', 'scene', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'when', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'running', 'natives', 'Armour', 'Gods', 'Jackie', 'down', 'mountainside', 'natives', 'follow', 'special', 'woven', 'one', 'man', 'made', 'great', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'movie', 'too', 'lastly', 'only', 'other', 'noteworthy', 'action', 'scene', 'finale', 'where', 'Jackie', 'whole', 'room', 'evil', 'men', 'followed', 'leader', '4', 'Amazon-like', 'leathered', 'up', 'women', 'kinda', 'silly', 'choreography', 'rather', 'amazing', 'least', 'solid', '4', 'minute', 'fight', 'scene.This', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'film', 'average', 'overall', 'good', 'action', 'infrequently', 'plot', 'too', 'boring', 'uninteresting', 'hold', 'attention', 'great', 'stunt', 'conclusion', 'where', 'Jackie', 'hot-air', 'balloon', 'camera', 'seem', 'unsure', 'height', 'balloon', 'ground', 'Nevertheless', 'am', 'sure', 'something', 'none', 'could', 'ever', 'pull', 'off', 'Also', 'Jackie', 'song', 'soundtrack', 'stunt', 'own', 'singing', 'comment', 'First', 'Strike', 'not', 'as', 'lousy', 'singer', 'thought']",Operation Condor 2: The Armour of the Gods VHS

First of all, it's not a  sequel to &quot;Operation Condor.&quot; It'a actually the other way  around--&quot;Operation Condor&quot; was a sequel to THIS film. Secondly,  &quot;Armour&quot; was originally released in 1986--hardly &quot;his newest  adventure,&quot; as the packaging claims. Lastly, little advantage has been  taken of the DVD format: &quot;Armour&quot; has been released in  widescreen, which is nice, but no extra features (like an &quot;original  language&quot; option or a &quot;making of&quot; docu-short) have been  added. And an actress whose last name is credited as &quot;Porner&quot; in  the movie is listed as &quot;Forner&quot; on the packaging. Typo?  Carelessness?All that having been said, &quot;Armour of God&quot; is  still a great deal of fun. The plot--in which Jackie's old girlfriend is  kidnapped by a death cult, who demand the Armour as payment for her  release--would have been too silly for an episode of  &quot;Scooby-Doo.&quot; But the stunt work by Chan and his crew is amazing,  especially in the last half hour. Jackie gets kicked, punched, set on fire  &amp; blown up...yet still can chew gum at the same time! The fight scenes  and car chases are funny and astoundingly complex and dangerous at the same  time. They're so delightful, in fact, that all else can be forgiven.

I got this DVD to finally have a copy on disc to replace my old VHS version.  Quality wise, this looks like a VHS-to-DVD port.  There hasn't been any enhancement done.  That really isn't what bothers me though.  What does is the title of ""Uncut Import"".  Sure, it's an import, but it is NOT uncut and that really bugs me.  My VHS is.  I haven't watched all the way through the DVD yet, but I have up to the point where Jackie is in the blonde woman's house fighting with the two Arab guys that broke in.  In the uncut scene, Jackie temporarily distracts them by tugging off the woman's red towel (she had just came out of the shower before the fight).  We see her bare back, the hilarious expressions of three guys who are suddenly transfixed on her body (which we don't see), then her immediate shame of being nude and snatching back the towel to cover up, which leads to the continued fight with the two guys.  In this DVD, that whole comedic scene has been cut.  Why?  There wasn't any nudity other than her bare back and a bit of her rear.  So, for a supposedly ""uncut"" disc, it is wrongly labeled.  Is this DVD worth getting?  Yes, if you are fan of JC, but don't expect a true ""uncut"" edition or crisp DVD quality imagery.UPDATE:  If you want the actual uncut version of the film, with the missing scene and a few quick nude shots, then I recommend the excellent Blu-ray by Fortune Star (available here on Amazon).  The sound and image quality is perfect.  Too bad the DVD couldn't have been a conversion of the Blu-ray.  My only issue is the subtitling.  They are good, but not totally accurate to what is being said.  This is really noticeable when the various actors speak occasional English words, like during the hotel scenes and fight.  For example, the manager of the establishment says ""Good sleep"", yet the subtitles moronically show up as ""Sleep well"".  There are a lot of screw-ups like that, so it makes me wonder how accurate the subtitles are concerning the Cantonese dialog translation.  Nonetheless, if you want the classic film in superb clarity, excellent sound, and uncut, snag the Blu-ray release.

It might make more sense to look at it as more of a prequel to Operation Condor, as Chan essentially does play the same character in both films.

Besides the car chase, the only other really noteworthy action scene comes at the very end of the movie, which didn't have the best acting, story or dialogue to begin with.

Both fell victim to dubbing and the distributors' shears, and when they were finally released were put out in the wrong order - thus Armour of God became Operation Condor 2, despite Condor being the second film...Famous as the film where a fairly 'easy' stunt almost killed Chan (you can see it going horribly wrong in the outtakes), Armour of God is a bit of a mess, and not just because of the dodgy continuity that sees Chan's pre-accident mop-top hairstyle suddenly change in the scenes he shot once out of hospital. For much of the time there's more clumsy comedy and farce than action, but just as you're almost ready to give up on it it throws in a half-hour finale with some of Chan's most impressive stunt fighting, all performed at the height of his ability.Although the Fortune Star Hong Kong remastered release is uncut and the PAL UK DVD from Hong Kong Legends contains ample and excellent extras, Dimension's release is typically a cut-and-dubbed version.
