1337252,A12NGRVC0KIZ7F,B003DJKZ6Y,Fredrick Tucker,"[4, 5]","Wow, releases of shows like MY THREE SONS make me so happy because I get to see the fine character actors of the golden age of television.  In this set, the stalwart performers who add so much sitcom spice include Billy Barty, Mary Jackson, the incomparable Reta Shaw, and the versatile Verna Felton (in one of her very final sitcom roles).  I was especially happy with this particular set's release, as the only copy I had of Miss Felton's episode ""COINCIDENCE"" was a bootleg.  I recently authored her biography, VERNA FELTON, published by Bear Manor Media.  She shines, although briefly, in this guest spot.  Fred MacMurray is awesome as Steve Douglas, and the boys are all charming in their characterizations, just as pleasing as William Frawley is grumpy as ""Bub.""  Very happy this has been released, but like so many others, I dislike the two volumes per season.",4,"Those Were the Days, My Friends!",1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,867,"['Wow', 'shows', 'MY', 'THREE', 'SONS', 'make', 'so', 'happy', 'get', 'see', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'golden', 'age', 'television', 'set', 'stalwart', 'performers', 'who', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'sitcom', 'spice', 'include', 'Billy', 'Barty', 'Mary', 'Jackson', 'incomparable', 'Reta', 'Shaw', 'versatile', 'Verna', 'Felton', 'one', 'very', 'final', 'sitcom', 'roles', 'was', 'especially', 'happy', 'particular', 'set', 'release', 'only', 'copy', 'had', 'Miss', 'Felton', 'episode', 'COINCIDENCE', 'was', 'bootleg', 'recently', 'authored', 'biography', 'VERNA', 'FELTON', 'published', 'Bear', 'Manor', 'Media', 'briefly', 'guest', 'spot', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'awesome', 'Steve', 'Douglas', 'boys', 'are', 'charming', 'characterizations', 'just', 'as', 'pleasing', 'William', 'Frawley', 'grumpy', 'Bub', 'Very', 'happy', 'been', 'released', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'dislike', 'two', 'volumes', 'season']",N/A

KEEFE ""gofour7""","[6, 8]","While I don't like the split season concept, my bigger concern is wasting money to buy the first two seasons and then never having the rest of the seasons released. I have been burned a bunch of times already: Party of Five, Charlie's Angels, Sliders, All in the Family, Bob Newhart, Knots Landing, Family Ties, George Lopez, Happy Days, The Virginian. I have noted countless others have done this since I wised up and decided to wait until all were out before taking the plunge. I know they think that they can gauge our interest by looking at sales numbers. However, they don't realize that shoddy practices of releasing only a few seasons and then not releasing later seasons is hurting their initial sales.
