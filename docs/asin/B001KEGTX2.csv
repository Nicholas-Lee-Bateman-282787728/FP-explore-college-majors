1207784,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B001KEGTX2,A. Boston,"[15, 27]","This is what I have to say, and if you're a Ghost Hunters watcher -- you will understand: If you find Brian Harnois the most likeable, entertaining person, there is something seriously wrong with the show.In my house, we LOVE watching the original Ghost Hunters with Jay and Grant. The investigators are entertaining, while also taking it seriously and having a scientific approach. Jay and Grant are awesome, Steve and Tango are hysterical together. And more importantly, they never easily mark anywhere as 'haunted'.I was really stoked when I heard about ghost hunters international(GHI). Being a traveler, I was excited to see if they'd visit any places I'd been, plus nearly everywhere else in the world has a longer history then here in the united states, so a much better chance of actually being haunted. So really, how could they go wrong? Well -- they did, and it was in their choice of investigators. I've heard this from a good number of people and seen it all over online, it's not just me who doesn't like them.They are HORRIBLE. Monotone, boring, and they jump on anything, like wind blowing, going ""did you hear that?!!!!!"" yea, it was the wind dude. The lead guy, Robb, is terrible, listening to him talk, he could put you to sleep. but not entirely, because you're too busy watching his non-stop eyebrows.In the current season(2) all anyone can do is stare at the girl, Brandy, with the terrible makeup(I'm not kidding, only wish I were). She's either trying to look like she has sunken eyes or like she has a black eye. They never find anything good and they are always declaring places haunted with the smallest noise or weird happening. With the real ghost hunters, Jay and Grant, they will try to debunk something first..these guys very rarely do that.So while they do go to super amazing places, those settings are ruined by the terrible cast. Now in season 2, I have finally broken up with GHI because I spent more time yelling at the tv or falling asleep then actually watching the show.Check out the original Ghost Hunters, you will not be disappointed.",2,Watched the whole season and it does not even touch the original Ghost Hunters,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,2078,"['what', 'have', 'say', ""'re"", 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'watcher', 'will', 'understand', 'find', 'Brian', 'Harnois', 'most', 'likeable', 'entertaining', 'person', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'show.In', 'house', 'LOVE', 'watching', 'original', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'Jay', 'Grant', 'investigators', 'are', 'entertaining', 'also', 'taking', 'seriously', 'having', 'scientific', 'approach', 'Jay', 'Grant', 'are', 'awesome', 'Steve', 'Tango', 'are', 'hysterical', 'together', 'more', 'importantly', 'never', 'easily', 'mark', 'anywhere', ""'haunted'.I"", 'was', 'really', 'stoked', 'when', 'heard', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'international', 'GHI', 'Being', 'traveler', 'was', 'excited', 'see', ""'d"", 'visit', 'places', ""'d"", 'been', 'nearly', 'everywhere', 'else', 'world', 'longer', 'history', 'then', 'here', 'united', 'states', 'much', 'better', 'chance', 'actually', 'being', 'haunted', 'So', 'really', 'how', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'Well', 'did', 'was', 'choice', 'investigators', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'good', 'number', 'people', 'seen', 'online', 'not', 'just', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'them.They', 'are', 'HORRIBLE', 'Monotone', 'boring', 'jump', 'anything', 'wind', 'blowing', 'going', 'did', 'hear', 'yea', 'was', 'wind', 'dude', 'lead', 'guy', 'Robb', 'terrible', 'listening', 'talk', 'could', 'put', 'sleep', 'not', 'entirely', ""'re"", 'too', 'busy', 'watching', 'non-stop', 'eyebrows.In', 'current', 'season', '2', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'stare', 'girl', 'Brandy', 'terrible', 'makeup', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'trying', 'look', 'sunken', 'eyes', 'black', 'eye', 'never', 'find', 'anything', 'good', 'are', 'always', 'declaring', 'places', 'haunted', 'smallest', 'noise', 'weird', 'happening', 'real', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'Jay', 'Grant', 'will', 'try', 'debunk', 'something', 'first..these', 'guys', 'very', 'rarely', 'do', 'that.So', 'do', 'go', 'super', 'amazing', 'places', 'settings', 'are', 'ruined', 'terrible', 'cast', 'Now', 'season', '2', 'have', 'finally', 'broken', 'up', 'GHI', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'yelling', 'tv', 'falling', 'asleep', 'then', 'actually', 'watching', 'show.Check', 'original', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Ghost Hunters: The Complete First Season

Reel ""rabbitnthemoon""","[18, 29]","I have been a fan of the original Ghost Hunters for years now and still enjoy plopping down on the sofa on Wednesday nights to watch the show.I was thrilled when they announced they were going international, but as previously mentioned in another review, they picked the wrong people to send abroad. My husband and I often joke that they would find anything haunted including a speck of dust, which normally, Jay and Grant from the original GH series would recognize as a piece of dust or bug for what it is. The lead investigator(Rob)in GHI is very boring, doesn't bring the kind of fun and personality as the original GH's cast does. For people that are looking for a show that truly looks into paranormal activity, this spin off is not the place to look. The original Ghost Hunter's series is where you should be looking. Jay and Grant truly investigate in a scientific manner and only when they can't explain away evidence that they have tried to debunk, will they then declare a site to either have paranormal activity(notice they don't say it's haunted) or to be haunted if there is an overwhelming amount of evidence to suggest the location to be so. Rob, in the GHI series, is too overeager in proclaiming almost all the locations he visits as being haunted. To me that isn't much investigating and just more fodder to keep people watching the show, I don't think this spin off will last too long unless they do some major cast changes and bring in someone with a more objective standpoint.",1,"Love Original GH, Hate GHI",1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,1498,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'original', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'years', 'now', 'still', 'enjoy', 'plopping', 'down', 'sofa', 'Wednesday', 'nights', 'watch', 'show.I', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'announced', 'were', 'going', 'international', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'review', 'picked', 'wrong', 'people', 'send', 'abroad', 'husband', 'often', 'joke', 'would', 'find', 'anything', 'haunted', 'including', 'speck', 'dust', 'normally', 'Jay', 'Grant', 'original', 'GH', 'series', 'would', 'recognize', 'piece', 'dust', 'bug', 'what', 'lead', 'investigator', 'Rob', 'GHI', 'very', 'boring', ""n't"", 'bring', 'kind', 'fun', 'personality', 'original', 'GH', 'cast', 'people', 'are', 'looking', 'show', 'truly', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'spin', 'off', 'not', 'place', 'look', 'original', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'series', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'looking', 'Jay', 'Grant', 'truly', 'investigate', 'scientific', 'manner', 'only', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'away', 'evidence', 'have', 'tried', 'debunk', 'will', 'then', 'declare', 'site', 'have', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'notice', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'haunted', 'be', 'haunted', 'overwhelming', 'amount', 'evidence', 'suggest', 'location', 'be', 'so', 'Rob', 'GHI', 'series', 'too', 'overeager', 'proclaiming', 'almost', 'locations', 'being', 'haunted', ""n't"", 'much', 'investigating', 'just', 'more', 'fodder', 'keep', 'people', 'watching', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'spin', 'off', 'will', 'last', 'too', 'long', 'do', 'major', 'cast', 'changes', 'bring', 'someone', 'more', 'objective', 'standpoint']",Ghost Hunters: The Complete First Season

1207789,A18XKEUEXECLRI,B001KEGTX2,"mcerner ""mcerner""","[8, 13]","During the show's early episodes, Brian, Andy and Donna from the original series had joined the cast.  All three lent lively personalities and years of expertise to the show, and the episodes were great entertainment (although Donna's tendency to shriek gets tedious really fast). But mid-season, these three had left.  The show needed to rely on the lead, Robb, and the ""experienced"" Barry.  Robb is not a debunker but instead tends to view everything as being haunted.  For instance, he can have an EVP that sounds like someone scraping their shoe on floorboards and he claims the place is haunted. He relies heavily on Barry, and Barry continually comes off as a phoney -- in every episode, something unobservable and unverifiable happens to him, like he claims to be touched or to see something behind a locked door.  Barry runs towards what ends up being nothing, and he runs away from a lot of things too (Brian used to get teased for this!).  Donna's replacement, Brandy, has a nasally voice that is not clear or inviting on TV.  The quality of the investigations is disappointing, and I can't help feeling like GHI is a disservice to the original.

1207790,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B001KEGTX2,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[2, 2]","If everyone started with the first Season of Ghost Hunters, they might not continue with the show for long.  From the drama, the unprofessional-ism and the revolving cast of characters, it is just hard to sink into.  Luckily, my introduction to this show came later on, when it was in its third season and things had improved so much that I instantly became obsessed with the show.Ghost Hunters follows TAPS, The Atlantic Paranormal Society, a ghost hunting group set up by Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, Roto-Rooters by day, family men all the time, and Ghost Hunters in their spare time.  With other investigators, and specialized equipment, they set out to do their best to disprove hauntings.  Which is very different from what most organizations out there do.  They want to have irrevocable proof before they say something paranormal is going on, and that's probably the reason that they've been able to keep the show going as long as it has.  Some of the equipment they use are cameras, heat sensors, and other electronic devices used to show anomalies in their surroundings.Jason and Grant are the main people in TAPS.  They run it and they make the decisions.  And they are opposites of each other.  Which actually works.  They have a good work chemistry and present their findings to people with ease and respect.  It's nice to see them investigate.  The same doesn't apply to all their investigators though.  There always seems to be drama going on and some of them are quite frankly, annoying and hard to believe.  They seem to work with a lot of people who don't live up to the belief of the organization and see a haunting in every shadow.  Luckily, this is one of the things that improves in future seasons.  I do have to admit that Steve is probably my favorite.  I've always had a little crush on him and he has such a calm personality that it's easy to watch him investigate.  The same can't be said of Brian Harnois, who is excitable, but at least genuine in his excitement.They brought in demonologists and wiccans and priests in this season and I'm actually rather glad they discontinue that in later seasons.  Bringing it in actually makes it seem not as real and when it is left out, it seems more scientific and believable.  For those that believe in Ghosts anyway.  I felt that these people did not add anything to this season.For the actual film, it's decent.  But because this is the first season their equipment is not as good as it is in later seasons.  Photos and video are fuzzy and the evidence harder to really see.  Luckily the audio is ok and some of what they catch is quite amazing.  And even some of the video is spectacular, just not as clear as you could hope it would be.  They also have a tendency to use dramatic music that, while it builds suspense, is distracting during the actual investigation parts of the episodes.TAPS investigates quite a few places in this short season, including private residences, the Mishler Theatre, the Altoona Railroad Museum, the Lighthouse Inn and John Stone Tavern, Race Rock Lighthouse, Eastern State Penitentiary, New Bedford Armory, Topton Tavern, and the New Boston Inn.  Not all of these places have been found to be haunted.  In fact, very few were.  Since this was the first season, all of these places fit onto three disks with ten episodes total.I really enjoy the show, even if I'm not a fan of the first season.  It's always interesting, they mostly have a good crew, and unusual things happen.  You don't have to believe in ghosts to enjoy it, but it will certainly make you expand your horizons a bit.Review by M.
