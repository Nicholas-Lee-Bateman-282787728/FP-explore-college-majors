The attention to detail and well researched story lines have kept it interesting,  Although I will continue to watch the many season reruns, I feel that the last three years were not as good as the beginning years.  Not as much physical hi-jinks as before.  Still love the show and cast and glad it had a long run.  Like to see VDO in another series instead of the questionable movies he made during and after this show, in my opinion, not that it stops me from watching everything he is in.

1553627,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B008HUSFXO,Boston Reader,"[0, 0]","It really isn't. It took me a while, but I eventually got use to Jeff Goldblum's Detective Nicholas. When I first watched the handful of episodes I caught on NBC, I was still getting over the fact my favorite Detective wasn't returning that season. But After watching it season 8 again in its entirety, I actually found it to be entertaining for the most part. The continuity with Detective Wheeler's broken engagement and her pregnancy. An episode that focused on someone from Eames's personal life. The episode where the poker player from season 5 returns is one of my favorites from this season. And heavy hitters worked on this season such as Walon Green and Ed Zukerman to name a few when Warren Leight departed his duties as show runner. I use to ridicule Walon Green for how poor this season was, but after watching it I realized it wasn't really all that bad. The one thing that prevents me from giving this season five stars isn't the fact that the season didn't last as long as it did in season 7 or SVU did the same year. It's not even the fact that my favorite cop from the Two-Seven doesn't make a comeback or that this is the last we ever see of Detective Megan Wheeler. The reason for my four star rating is the fact that one episode was excluded from this boxset. Probably one of the best episodes in the season. The episode titled ""The Glory That Was..."" was cut from the boxset and all official forms of online streaming and purchasing due to the fact that the episode was centered on a conspiracy centered on the rigging of location of the 2016 Summer Olympic games. Brazilian government were so outraged that they forced NBC has prevented the episode from re-airing on all its affiliate networks and removed it from all online streaming as well as region 1 DVDs which by the way only work in North America. But in this day and age there are ways to see this forbidden 42 minutes of television. Apart from that, most of the episodes were well written. Some that I thought were boring the first time around turned out to be entertaining watching them again and paying attention. In season 8, Criminal Intent is still the dark cerebral drama it has always been, but you can't blame the new showrunners giving the series a different feel to the show after the departure of a fan favorite and long time producer. Ultimately this season is for the optimistic fan of Criminal Intent who has been there through thick and thin (e.i. season 6). But to those who still hold season dearly to their hearts, give this season a chance. It is still top notch and the writing is still good enough to want you to continue fallowing our Major Case detectives. These are their storeis.",4,Not So Great?

He is quirky, but in a different way than Goren. Also, like many others, I couldn't understand some of the decisions/missed opportunities made by the producers in their stories this season.Two glaring errors were in the episode 'All In', in which the character Josh Snow was obviously Joey Frost from season 5. There was no reason not to keep him as Joey Frost, which would have provided some continuity. (perhaps they couldn't get the original actor who played Joey for this episode?)Also, in the episode 'Faithfully', Goren's 'new family' is most likely his previously unknown family via his biological father Mark Ford Brady (the infamous serial killer).Also, the missing episode 'The Glory That Was' being withdrawn from broadcast (and not included on dvd) due to apparent pressure from outside the U.S. is especially galling.And finally, there is the inexcusable falling off in manufacturing quality by Shout Factory, from the packaging to the lack of Subtitles (using the obsolete technology of Closed Captions). The use of Closed Captions instead of Subtitles  causes people with hearing trouble to make a choice. Watch in HD and have no visible dialogue.

All were created by Dick Wolf. He got his start with Miami Vice (1984-1989). Dick did have help with Criminal Intent, Ren&eacute; Balcer, who also wrote for the series Star Trek: The Next Generation.Criminal Intent follows the Major Case Squad, a division of the New York City Police Department.In season 8, Detective Mike Logan (Chris Noth) is replaced by Detective Zack Nichols (Jeff Goldblum). I think even Jeff knows he's an aquired taste. In this case it works. We find out early that Mike is the child of two psychiatrists. His reason for becoming a cop seems to be a form of rebellion. The Jewish actor, however, has decided not to return to Criminal Intent due to persistent concerns about the program's future.Also included are Detective Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio), Detective Alexandra Earnes (Kathryn Erbe), Detective Megan Wheeler (Julianne Nicholson) and Captain Danny Ross (Eric Bogosian).Some of the key episodes are ""Rock Star"" in which Wheeler and Nichols investigate the stabbing of an artist, which is followed by a seemingly unrelated elevator death of a musician.""Identity Crisis"" where two young brothers are turned over to foster services after their schizophrenic mother is electorcuted in the bathtub.
