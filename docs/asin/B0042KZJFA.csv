1383273,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B0042KZJFA,barry,"[9, 9]","I wish this film had had the budget to raise the production values above that of a low budget gay film for this is a light-hearted gay romantic comedy where everything works.  The characters are not caricatures and after my first viewing of this film last night it is lingering in my thoughts and I can't wait to watch it again.  It is very true that self doubting Blaine (Nicholas Downs) is indeed a cutie but in the mainstream gay culture, especially the clubs, if that handsome face doesn't come with a gym well muscled bod often the nicest guys can get overlooked.  It makes perfect sense when Blaine meets a Texan hottie Xander (David Loren) on line and they bond on all things that matter, not the superficial, that he gets insecure when he sees that Xander thinks he is indeed his roommate Cameron who is a muscle stud stripper for his pic was accidentally on his facebook page.If the story line sounds silly believe me as it unfolds it makes perfect sense.  Blaine is portrayed perfectly but for me the heart and soul of the film rests in Xander.  David Loren takes this Texan stud and gives him the purest romantic heart and soul that any person would seek in their mate.  Through Xander we see someone seeking romance, trust and sincerity.  He wears his heart on his sleeve and it is a necessary reminder that there are still people like this around.  Cameron, Blaine's roommate, played by Adam Huss also perfectly shows how a guy can truly be happy seeking sexual encounters, nothing serious and still have the capacity to be a good and sincere person.All the characters here are well thought out and for the first time even the insightful older gay (played by Bruce Gray) is not over the top and very believable as a person a little jaded with age but filled with wisdom.  This movie shows that romance is still a possibility, though sometimes you need to fight hard.  Please ignore the low budget film work and judge it by its heart and talent involved.  The blu ray is fine.  The picture doesn't pop like a mainstream film.  The video is in 720P and not the norm 1080p.  Audio is great with a DTS HD Master audio 5.1 track.  Dialogue is strong and music blends in perfectly.  There are tons of extras as well.  The blu ray ends up presenting itself just fine.  I highly recommend this film for the romantic in you.  It will touch you with these characters you can relate to.

The romantic leads, Blaine and Xander, are so cute and I'd take both of them over that beefcake Cameron any day. And this film really shows that honesty is the best policy. Blaine lied and almost missed out on love. If he would have told the truth in the beginning, he could have Xander much sooner. But then we wouldn't have had a movie.As most romantic comedies are, Is It Just Me? is pretty predictable. There are two people who we think will never get together, but in the end...well, if you've seen just one romantic comedy you know what I'm talking about. There's really only one thing that I didn't like about Is It Just Me?, which isn't the fault of the filmmakers because it is realistic. And that is many gay men are shallow and would rather date a hunk with muscles than a guy who is sweet and ""average"" in appearance. I'm not one of those men, as I've already stated that I would take Blaine over Cameron any day. Of course, I'm ""average"" too.Any way, Is It Just Me? comes recommended to anyone who is looking for a gay romance.

Not into bars, casual sex and game playing, he channels his loneliness and angst into his column for a newspaper.  His roommate, Cameron (Adam Huss), is a shallow, sex-obsessed gym-bunny who acts in bad movies and works as a go-go boy at a WeHo gay bar, exactly the type of guy Blaine tries to avoid.  But when Blaine meets Xander (David Loren) online, a guy who seems to be perfect for him, he accidentally sends him Cameron's photo by mistake, and is convinced that Xander only wants to meet him because he looks like that. Cameron agrees to pose as Blaine at their initial meeting, to which Blaine (posing as roommate Cameron) also attends, and things go horribly wrong from here.The ""used someone else's image online"" bit has been used before (most recently in a gay comedy that was very forgettable), but strikes the perfect balance here in testing Blaine to be more self-assured and confident in seeking a relationship. Also loved the inclusion of an older gay ""mentor"" (played by character actor Bruce Gray) for Xander.  Overall, a charmingly positive and realistic story, produced and acted very well by talented professionals.

After meeting briefly online, the two engage in long phone conversations before agreeing to meet. So far, it's the typical romance all single guys desire. Butterflies in the stomach, and one like after another - a match made in heaven, so it seems.  However, a series of events leads to a case of mistaken identity, leaving us wondering if love stands a chance?I must admit as we're midway through the film, I was throwing my hands up at the screen - not at the film, but at the character Blaine.  If you're Blaine in ""real life"", hopefully you learned a lesson.  Honestly counts, and matters - so be honest up front!All in all it is a cute film, imperfect I imagine, but generally cute, fun and keeping us smiling ... and hoping. Zander's landlord (and friend) Ernie is a key character in the film for the nearing and over 50 single crowd.  Played by Bruce Gray (who starred as George in Season 2 on Queer As Folk), his wisdom and friendship to Zander is a life saver, for Blaine, and for the viewer.No doom and gloom, just heartfelt and sweet - it may just make the viewer get up and celebrate life!

In his column, Blaine talks about life for a gay man who is searching for the real thing, not just what's behind a man's zipper. Unlike his dance-club stripper roommate Cameron, Blaine is a hopeless romantic turned off by the Los Angeles gay lifestyle he see's around him. As he is searching internet personal profiles, he receives an instant message from a gay cowboy from Texas who has recently moved to LA. The two begin chatting and Blaine is surprised that his admirer Xander is quoting passages from his own article. An instant connection begins and the two begin talking on the phone at great length as they fall in love with each other. BUT as it comes time for the two to meet in person, Blaine realizes that he has been logged into his roommates internet connection and the pictures Xander has viewed are not photo's of him, but rather his very hot roommate.He is left trying to figure out how to meet Xander without him being very disappointed to find out Blaine is not the beefy super model hunk he thinks he has found. So Blaine and Cameron switch places and things start getting pretty messy. Is there a way out of this catastrophy without losing the perfect relationship?A very sweet romantic comedy that will enthroll you from beginning to end. The actors in this film are awesome and I fell in love with their characters. Nicholas Downs (Blaine) and David Loren (Xander) shine in their performances. Very professional acting from both who make their characters come alive in a beautiful way. The supporting cast is also quite good and the characters they portray lend a touch of excellence to the film. The only negative I have with this film is the sound quality. The quality is alright once you turn it up loud enough to hear it, but you'll definitely want to adjust your volumn. This movie get a 5-star rating from me and will certainly go down as one of my very favorites. You won't be disappointed in this one. It's even better than the description makes it out to be!

1383288,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B0042KZJFA,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[6, 10]","Ooooohhh La La..La...LA....LA.....Los Angeles!  And its happy Gay Boy scene----was a wild and zany place in Director Todd Stephens 2001 film (Another Gay Movie) and later sequel.....But here, it's a quieter and more introspective place, in the script given us by Director J. C. Calciano for his ""Is It Just Me?""  So, yes, perhaps weirdly, this movie struck me as something of a beginnings.....a buildup to what might come later in the raunch and wild zaniness of Stephen's works.  Now choose which suits you better, Mr. / Ms. Viewer:  This current, more quietly romantic approach.....or the runaway, sexual hijinks of those earlier works?(( Being upfront with you, I ask you bear in mind that my following thoughts are those of a much older viewer who never learned to care for Stephen's 2-film series.  Though I'm sure you younger kids out there are much more appreciative of such works, as well as Calciano's efforts in this new film. Now, to business. ))You've likely already read about the done and done again storyline of this ""Mistaken Identity and Comedy of Errors"" film, so why waste our time with that.  Instead, let me just spin a few thoughts about the leads / characters, and the manner in which they come across:- A soft-bodied (read: no gym time), main lead (Nicholas Downs as Blaine) who, though low in self esteem, seems able to rally our support for his character (maybe we're seeing too much of ourselves there).  While I wouldn't call him the best actor of the bunch, he cries convincingly and does come across as sweet (a good foil for roommate, Cameron's persona).  Strangely enough, in his DVD Special Features interview, Downs presents as the more lively, less deadpan person we were rooting for him to become in the film.- A second lead (David Loren as Xander) is a guitar playing songwriter who can't play guitar.....and can't sing (oh, you think I'm wrong, do you?).  But what those areas lack, he more than makes up for in hunky cuteness (that's what counts, eh?).  He's the real romantic in this film, and he presents his lines in such a way as to prove it.  A really nice guy who always comes across as that; I'll take him over either of the other two male leads.  Oh, and while speaking of ""X"", let's not forget his oh-so-helpful landlord / housemate.....an old ""Gay Philosophizer,"" endearingly (and too often, interruptingly) played by a well performing Bruce Gray.- Last, but far from least, we have our explosive tertiary lead, Cameron (Adam Huss).  A waxed and gym-toned cutie who's as carefree as can be.....yet still winds up being the standup friend you always need.  If possible, this guy is more fun in his Special Features interview than he is during scenes (hey, Adam, your grandfather doesn't happened to be named Robert, does he?).Now to Writer / Director Calciano and some final thoughts.  My overall impression of this work leads me, as so often happens with gay themed films, to wonder:  As opposed to better foreign productions / directors, why can't US film makers give us a gay romance film in which romantic emotions and physical acts come across in such a way that we, the audience, can SEE and FEEL the passion....the tenderness....the closeness between two men?  The best you'll do with our meant-to-be-together leads in this work is a little (interrupted) phone sex and conversations about similar likes and interests.  Worse, our great director is in such a hurry with the final kiss by the leads.....well, all I can say is:  Don't Blink!DVD Special Features consist of Cast Auditions and Interviews, along with some Deleted Scenes (in which you sadly learn that it's Adam Huss, as Cameron, who gives us the best kiss in the whole movie).So, how to end all this?  Let me do it by asking:  Is it fun and cute and attention-holding?  Well, yes.....for the most part. But that doesn't mean it couldn't have been better.....and my rating reflects that.  (And yes, yes, yes.....I watched it more than once before butting in here).PS--Looking out for your viewing welfare, here's a little tip for you.  If you want to see a movie in which the love and passion between 2 men is almost real enough to touch, be on the lookout for a little Peruvian 2009 production, titled, ""Undertow"" (I've commented on it at IMDb.com, under the review title: ""Faggots & Ghosts....""). It's my understanding Wolfe Video will be releasing it in the first half of 2011 (or if you've got an all-regions DVD player, the film is now available through Amazon.com.co.uk and other European outlets).  Oh, and for one of gay filmdom's longest (and hottest) male kissing scenes, please check out ""Ciao"" (2008) (yes, I've reviewed that here).",3,"""ANOTHER GAY MOVIE"" -- The Prequel......",1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,4660,"['Ooooohhh', 'La', 'La..La', 'LA', '.LA', '..Los', 'Angeles', 'happy', 'Gay', 'Boy', 'scene', 'was', 'wild', 'zany', 'place', 'Director', 'Todd', 'Stephens', '2001', 'film', 'Gay', 'Movie', 'later', 'sequel', '..But', 'here', 'quieter', 'more', 'introspective', 'place', 'script', 'given', 'Director', 'J.', 'C.', 'Calciano', 'Just', 'Me', 'So', 'yes', 'perhaps', 'weirdly', 'movie', 'struck', 'something', 'beginnings', '..a', 'buildup', 'what', 'might', 'come', 'later', 'raunch', 'wild', 'zaniness', 'Stephen', 'works', 'Now', 'choose', 'suits', 'better', 'Mr.', '/', 'Ms.', 'Viewer', 'current', 'more', 'quietly', 'romantic', 'approach', 'runaway', 'sexual', 'hijinks', 'earlier', 'works', 'Being', 'upfront', 'ask', 'bear', 'mind', 'following', 'thoughts', 'are', 'much', 'older', 'viewer', 'who', 'never', 'learned', 'care', 'Stephen', '2-film', 'series', ""'m"", 'sure', 'younger', 'kids', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'appreciative', 'such', 'works', 'as', 'well', 'Calciano', 'efforts', 'new', 'film', 'Now', 'business', ""'ve"", 'likely', 'already', 'read', 'done', 'done', 'again', 'storyline', 'Mistaken', 'Identity', 'Comedy', 'Errors', 'film', 'so', 'why', 'waste', 'time', 'Instead', 'let', 'just', 'spin', 'few', 'thoughts', 'leads', '/', 'characters', 'manner', 'come', 'soft-bodied', 'read', 'gym', 'time', 'main', 'lead', 'Nicholas', 'Downs', 'Blaine', 'who', 'though', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'able', 'rally', 'support', 'character', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'too', 'much', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'best', 'actor', 'bunch', 'convincingly', 'come', 'sweet', 'good', 'foil', 'roommate', 'Cameron', 'persona', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'interview', 'Downs', 'more', 'lively', 'less', 'deadpan', 'person', 'were', 'rooting', 'become', 'film.-', 'A', 'second', 'lead', 'David', 'Loren', 'Xander', 'guitar', 'playing', 'songwriter', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'guitar', '..and', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'oh', 'think', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'do', 'what', 'areas', 'lack', 'more', 'up', 'hunky', 'cuteness', 'what', 'eh', 'real', 'romantic', 'film', 'lines', 'such', 'way', 'prove', 'A', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'across', ""'ll"", 'take', 'other', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'Oh', 'speaking', 'X', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'oh-so-helpful', 'landlord', '/', 'housemate', 'old', 'Gay', 'Philosophizer', 'endearingly', 'too', 'often', 'interruptingly', 'played', 'well', 'performing', 'Bruce', 'Gray.-', 'Last', 'far', 'least', 'have', 'explosive', 'tertiary', 'lead', 'Cameron', 'Adam', 'Huss', 'waxed', 'gym-toned', 'cutie', 'who', 'as', 'carefree', 'can', 'be', '..yet', 'still', 'up', 'being', 'standup', 'friend', 'always', 'need', 'possible', 'guy', 'more', 'fun', 'Special', 'Features', 'interview', 'scenes', 'hey', 'Adam', 'grandfather', ""n't"", 'happened', 'be', 'named', 'Robert', '.Now', 'Writer', '/', 'Director', 'Calciano', 'final', 'thoughts', 'overall', 'impression', 'work', 'so', 'often', 'gay', 'themed', 'films', 'wonder', 'opposed', 'better', 'foreign', 'productions', '/', 'directors', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'US', 'film', 'makers', 'give', 'gay', 'romance', 'film', 'romantic', 'emotions', 'physical', 'acts', 'come', 'such', 'way', 'audience', 'can', 'SEE', 'FEEL', 'passion', '.the', 'tenderness', 'closeness', 'two', 'men', 'best', ""'ll"", 'do', 'meant-to-be-together', 'leads', 'work', 'little', 'interrupted', 'phone', 'sex', 'conversations', 'similar', 'likes', 'interests', 'Worse', 'great', 'director', 'such', 'hurry', 'final', 'kiss', 'leads', '..well', 'can', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Blink', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'consist', 'Cast', 'Auditions', 'Interviews', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'sadly', 'learn', 'Adam', 'Huss', 'Cameron', 'who', 'best', 'kiss', 'whole', 'movie', '.So', 'how', 'end', 'Let', 'do', 'asking', 'fun', 'cute', 'attention-holding', 'Well', 'yes', '..for', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'mean', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', '..and', 'rating', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes', '..I', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'butting', 'here', '.PS', 'Looking', 'out', 'viewing', 'welfare', 'here', 'little', 'tip', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'love', 'passion', '2', 'men', 'almost', 'real', 'enough', 'touch', 'be', 'lookout', 'little', 'Peruvian', '2009', 'production', 'titled', 'Undertow', ""'ve"", 'commented', 'IMDb.com', 'review', 'title', 'Faggots', 'Ghosts', 'understanding', 'Wolfe', 'Video', 'will', 'be', 'releasing', 'first', 'half', '2011', ""'ve"", 'got', 'all-regions', 'DVD', 'player', 'film', 'now', 'available', 'Amazon.com.co.uk', 'other', 'European', 'outlets', 'Oh', 'one', 'gay', 'filmdom', 'longest', 'hottest', 'male', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'please', 'check', 'Ciao', '2008', 'yes', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'here']",N/A

They're all about giving viewers a glimpse of skin and hot sex scenes, but they're not so great at showing the truly warm, romantic side of gay relationships.Is It Just Me bucks that trend.  This is an extraordinary film in that the characters are not broadly painted stereotypes, but nuanced and interesting individuals.  You may think you know what to expect from each character, but, happily, you'd likely be wrong.  Not one of these characters is simple or stereotyped, and all are likable.  Gay viewers will see themselves in these characters, but unlike many modern gay movies, they'll see the best parts of themselves reflected on the screen.Surprisingly for a film of this genre, one of my favorite characters was Ernie, Xander's older roommate (played by Bruce Gray), who is both witty and truly kind.  Ernie feels very real and very sweet, and you'll wish you had a gay roommate just like him.Adam Huss also turns in a solid performance as Cameron, our protagonist's, ahem, very popular and very hunky roommate.  The screenwriter could easily have painted Cameron as a cad, and the fact that he did not do so is testament to the interesting artistic choices this movie makes.The writing and direction in this film are both spot on.  This movie avoids the campy/bitchy/cynical humor that's so common in gay films these days in favor or a warm humor that makes me feel happy to be gay.If you're looking for a warm, wise, heartwarming romantic comedy (that just happens to be gay), this is it.
