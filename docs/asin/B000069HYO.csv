However, Dan McCafferty is still one of my all time favorite singers. Not vocalist but singer, raw , to the point and very unique. I can never get over the grainy growl, I dont think I would like to have a sit down talk with him however as it would be too distracting just taking in his spoken word voice.Songs are very good. The newer guitar player sometimes makes me think Manny is still there. Pete Agnews son on drums keeps it in the family and is a good replacement. I do admit that Petes bass is way subdued from what you hear on record or CD. The big bloopy, hard thumping is just not there but you can hear his instrument faintly.I think these guys were very underrated. I do admit that some of their stuff was a little poppish for me or even over the top and on the other side where I wouldnt bother to go. But albums like Razamanaz, Loud and Proud, Hair of the Dog and No Mean City are among the top of my music catalog and all are represented at least in a small way here.",5,fabulous from a fabulous band,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,1099,"['guys', 'are', 'music', 'nothing', 'presentation', 'such', 'old', 'bands', 'Yes', 'somebody', 'However', 'Dan', 'McCafferty', 'still', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'singers', 'Not', 'vocalist', 'singer', 'raw', 'point', 'very', 'unique', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'grainy', 'growl', 'dont', 'think', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'sit', 'down', 'talk', 'however', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'distracting', 'just', 'taking', 'spoken', 'word', 'voice.Songs', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'newer', 'guitar', 'player', 'sometimes', 'think', 'Manny', 'still', 'there', 'Pete', 'Agnews', 'son', 'drums', 'keeps', 'family', 'good', 'replacement', 'do', 'admit', 'Petes', 'bass', 'way', 'subdued', 'what', 'hear', 'record', 'CD', 'big', 'bloopy', 'hard', 'thumping', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'can', 'hear', 'instrument', 'faintly.I', 'think', 'guys', 'were', 'very', 'underrated', 'do', 'admit', 'stuff', 'was', 'little', 'poppish', 'even', 'top', 'other', 'side', 'where', 'wouldnt', 'bother', 'go', 'albums', 'Razamanaz', 'Loud', 'Proud', 'Hair', 'Dog', 'No', 'Mean', 'City', 'are', 'top', 'music', 'catalog', 'are', 'represented', 'least', 'small', 'way', 'here']",N/A

Yeah, they are 50 year old guys now butDan still has his hair and that killer voice.  The songs still rock especially Miss Misery, Beggars Day, Whiskey Drinking Woman and Hair of the Dog.  They sound great, the new guitar player holds up well. I have watched it every day for three days and like it more and more. Very glad I picked this up. Dan's voice has not changed after all these years. Unbelievable. Like all the great bands of the 70's, their fans have all gotten old but the music is still great.",4,First time seeing Nazareth,1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,592,"['grew', 'up', '70', 'listening', 'Hair', 'Dog', 'never', 'saw', 'live', 'film', 'Yeah', 'are', '50', 'year', 'old', 'guys', 'now', 'butDan', 'still', 'hair', 'killer', 'voice', 'songs', 'still', 'rock', 'especially', 'Miss', 'Misery', 'Beggars', 'Day', 'Whiskey', 'Drinking', 'Woman', 'Hair', 'Dog', 'sound', 'great', 'new', 'guitar', 'player', 'up', 'well', 'have', 'watched', 'day', 'three', 'days', 'more', 'more', 'Very', 'glad', 'picked', 'up', 'Dan', 'voice', 'not', 'changed', 'years', 'Unbelievable', 'great', 'bands', '70', 'fans', 'have', 'gotten', 'old', 'music', 'still', 'great']",N/A
