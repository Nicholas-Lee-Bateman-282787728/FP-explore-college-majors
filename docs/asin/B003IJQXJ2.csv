1346620,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B003IJQXJ2,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","LONG PIGS takes the same Mockumentary approach to cannibalism as MAN BITES DOG had to the crime thriller. In it, a group of amateur filmmakers set out to document the life of Anthony McAllister, a modern cannibal and self-proclaimed chef, as he lures his newest victims into becoming dinner. While it bears a strong similarity to MAN BITES DOG, this dark comedy is no cheap imitation. Chris Power and Nathan Hynes have produced their own sharp and witty dialog that takes a bite out of the Horror genre. Anthony Alviano is both charming and charismatic in the lead, with a disarming personality that draws the audience into his depraved world. The funniest moments in the film are derived organically through Anthony's subtle performance and the casualness with which he describes his morbid activities. Less is more in this case, since many of the obvious attempts at humor (like the inclusion of ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" during a particularly gruesome scene) detract from the realism of the situation. Power and Hynes do give their documentary-style filming an increased sense of authenticity by conducting mic checks and by coaching Anthony on camera. Another impressive aspect of the film is how graphic and lifelike the butchering scenes are, since they are often indiscernible from reality. LONG PIGS comes as a big surprise in the Indie circuit, with an equal blend of comedy and horror that is sure to appeal to fans of MAN BITES DOG and BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,Long Pigs,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,1527,"['LONG', 'PIGS', 'same', 'Mockumentary', 'approach', 'cannibalism', 'MAN', 'BITES', 'DOG', 'had', 'crime', 'thriller', 'group', 'amateur', 'filmmakers', 'set', 'out', 'document', 'life', 'Anthony', 'McAllister', 'modern', 'cannibal', 'self-proclaimed', 'chef', 'newest', 'victims', 'becoming', 'dinner', 'strong', 'similarity', 'MAN', 'BITES', 'DOG', 'dark', 'comedy', 'cheap', 'imitation', 'Chris', 'Power', 'Nathan', 'Hynes', 'have', 'produced', 'own', 'sharp', 'witty', 'dialog', 'bite', 'Horror', 'genre', 'Anthony', 'Alviano', 'charming', 'charismatic', 'lead', 'disarming', 'personality', 'audience', 'depraved', 'world', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'derived', 'organically', 'Anthony', 'subtle', 'performance', 'casualness', 'morbid', 'activities', 'Less', 'more', 'case', 'many', 'obvious', 'attempts', 'humor', 'inclusion', 'Dance', 'Sugar', 'Plum', 'Fairy', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'detract', 'realism', 'situation', 'Power', 'Hynes', 'do', 'give', 'documentary-style', 'filming', 'increased', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'conducting', 'mic', 'checks', 'coaching', 'Anthony', 'camera', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'film', 'how', 'graphic', 'butchering', 'scenes', 'are', 'are', 'often', 'indiscernible', 'reality', 'LONG', 'PIGS', 'big', 'surprise', 'Indie', 'circuit', 'equal', 'blend', 'comedy', 'horror', 'sure', 'appeal', 'fans', 'MAN', 'BITES', 'DOG', 'BEHIND', 'THE', 'MASK', 'RISE', 'OF', 'LESLIE', 'VERNON.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Long Pigs

Now we get bludgeoned and hacked with an even more gruesome terror.  Yes, it's human beings on the chopping block.  Dark, gritty, and demented, this Clowns After Midnight production is bound to get under your skin.Long Pigs is an all-too-real mockumentary on Anthony McAlistar, an affable cannibal without a conscience.  Anthony has allowed two young filmmakers full access to his life and his disturbing meal preparations.  Believe me, it is quite uncomfortable watching this monster work.  Partly because of his friendly disposition and his total disregard for human life.  Also because of the specific details he shares with you and the pride he takes in his work.  Anthony seems to enjoy the spotlight as the film captures his heinous deeds.  This also brings into question the moral disposition of the cameramen watching the crimes, plus the media's fascination with such atrocities.Long Pigs is very well made, receiving several awards at different film fests.  The lead acting from Anthony Alviano seems almost too convincing.  Much of the script seems improvised, adding to the authenticy.  There is some brief nudity and a little bit of gore as the cook cuts up his fresh corpses for cooking.  Toss in the sloppy camerawork, scattershot direction, plus the quick and brutal murders and you have quite the sick little independent horror film.",4,The cannibal doc to gnaw away at your comfort zone,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,1438,"['First', 'was', 'witches', 'Blair', 'Project', 'Then', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Now', 'get', 'bludgeoned', 'hacked', 'even', 'more', 'gruesome', 'terror', 'Yes', 'human', 'beings', 'chopping', 'block', 'Dark', 'gritty', 'demented', 'Clowns', 'Midnight', 'production', 'bound', 'get', 'skin.Long', 'Pigs', 'all-too-real', 'mockumentary', 'Anthony', 'McAlistar', 'affable', 'cannibal', 'conscience', 'Anthony', 'allowed', 'two', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'full', 'access', 'life', 'disturbing', 'meal', 'preparations', 'Believe', 'quite', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'monster', 'work', 'Partly', 'friendly', 'disposition', 'total', 'disregard', 'human', 'life', 'Also', 'specific', 'details', 'shares', 'pride', 'work', 'Anthony', 'enjoy', 'spotlight', 'film', 'heinous', 'deeds', 'also', 'question', 'moral', 'disposition', 'cameramen', 'watching', 'crimes', 'media', 'fascination', 'such', 'atrocities.Long', 'Pigs', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'receiving', 'several', 'awards', 'different', 'film', 'fests', 'lead', 'acting', 'Anthony', 'Alviano', 'almost', 'too', 'convincing', 'Much', 'script', 'improvised', 'adding', 'authenticy', 'brief', 'nudity', 'little', 'bit', 'gore', 'cook', 'up', 'fresh', 'corpses', 'cooking', 'Toss', 'sloppy', 'camerawork', 'scattershot', 'direction', 'quick', 'brutal', 'murders', 'have', 'quite', 'sick', 'little', 'independent', 'horror', 'film']",Long Pigs

1346626,A1N9QERVTIUA9,B003IJQXJ2,"Patrick Ricketts ""Videovews.org""","[1, 1]","This sounded like a pretty interesting Mocumentary horror flick but I admit I never expected it to be as good and entertaining as it was. Billed as a horror/comedy I got to say I didn't see much funny about it other then a few lines here and there that made me chuckle a bit but besides those I thought this was a pretty scary horror flick. Now when I say scary I don't mean like a slasher or ghost film might scare someone, instead Long Pigs provides it's scares through it's story and characters. This is a man who kills people for the pleasure of enjoying them for dinner, how much more horrifying can it get? The other scary part about this man was how he invited these two men with cameras into his home and allowed them to film his every move while being as polite as your next door neighbor is. To be honest to give away what happens in the movie just would not be right so I am not going to go into spoilers here. If you didn't know this wasn't a real film you would think it was that is how good every actor in the film is in portraying their roles, easily some of the best acting I have seen in an Independent, low budget film and I have seen my share of them to know. Real or mock doesn't matter much here because these talented film makers did a great job at showing just one of the many horrors that happens everyday and also providing some food for thought on the media itself and just how far or too far they go in covering our news. As far as the genre goes I am sure you can find others more bloodier but for over all content I don't think you will find many more frightening as Long Pigs. With the numerous awards the film has already won I am sure these talented film-makers know the kind of film they have create but I can add that I thought this was one of the most clever,well-written and disturbing films I have seen in some time and it left me not only feeling a bit uneasy but with a number of things to think about as well.

It was definitely different, dark and funny, but way too predictable and the entire premise that this would even be a remote possibility for even the most desperate struggling film makers was way too hard to swallow.  No pun intended.  Also, the social commentary that it was forcing down your throat was way too obvious and made it feel amateurish.  The acting was good especially Anthony Alviano and did a good job walking the fine line of almost understanding his detachment.  The comedy was witty and was thrown in at the right spots and gave you relief and kept you watching.
