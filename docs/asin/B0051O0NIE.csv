1437058,A3C9UDU6XQQ70Q,B0051O0NIE,Canuck in WA,"[3, 3]","Probably the best season of Hell's Kitchen in the 10 year history of the show.  Kevin and Dave show just what true grit really is (wont reveal just what adversity they encounter, but you'll give kudos to both of them when you do see it), and Tennille and Van do crack me up alot on what comes out of their mouths when pulled aside in private (also makes you cringe alot on some of the idiotic comments that come out of Tennille's mouth as well).  What made Season 6 especially enjoyable was that it seemed to have a fair share of competent chefs (vs. this year (Season 10) when it seems like they are all escapees from a minimum/maximum security kitchen vying for a spot at the Paris/Las Vegas Casino) for this contest; which made it interesting to see some of the stuff that these individuals could create from scratch in only 30 to 45 minutes (I still admire this quality about the competent ones).  One item of note;  the one chef named ""Lovely"", be ready to witness laziness taken to a new level.  I thought Lacey in Season 5 was a sloth, but for Lovely, you could time this one with a sundial. . .Enjoy the trainwreck, and watch for the phrase ""Whistle Britches"" . .it is hilarious!",5,Very memorable season for Hell's Kitchen,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,1187,"['Probably', 'best', 'season', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', '10', 'year', 'history', 'show', 'Kevin', 'Dave', 'show', 'just', 'what', 'true', 'grit', 'really', 'wont', 'reveal', 'just', 'what', 'adversity', 'encounter', ""'ll"", 'give', 'kudos', 'when', 'do', 'see', 'Tennille', 'Van', 'do', 'crack', 'up', 'alot', 'what', 'mouths', 'when', 'pulled', 'aside', 'private', 'also', 'cringe', 'alot', 'idiotic', 'comments', 'come', 'Tennille', 'mouth', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'made', 'Season', '6', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'seemed', 'have', 'fair', 'share', 'competent', 'chefs', 'year', 'Season', '10', 'when', 'are', 'escapees', 'minimum/maximum', 'security', 'kitchen', 'vying', 'spot', 'Paris/Las', 'Vegas', 'Casino', 'contest', 'made', 'interesting', 'see', 'stuff', 'individuals', 'could', 'create', 'scratch', 'only', '30', '45', 'minutes', 'still', 'admire', 'quality', 'competent', 'ones', 'One', 'item', 'note', 'one', 'chef', 'named', 'Lovely', 'be', 'ready', 'witness', 'laziness', 'taken', 'new', 'level', 'thought', 'Lacey', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'sloth', 'Lovely', 'could', 'time', 'one', 'sundial', '.Enjoy', 'trainwreck', 'watch', 'phrase', 'Whistle', 'Britches', '.it', 'hilarious']",N/A

Well, I was surprised  the Shipping came by the carrier that i need it too, got to my place on time and the product is in good shape.

And once again I feel it brings everything the past seasons had and makes it better. Teamwork=good, challenges=good and there are some good comebacks, relationships=great, Ramsay=ON FIRE. He gets into major battles with some people and beats them to shreds. And its awesome.Progress of the chef's is amazing and two chef's quests to show Ramsay what they can do will steal you away.This season is positive, funny, intense at times and very rewarding.Along with Season 5 this is one of the best, if not the best season.

1437063,AEZ4DZCUL021H,B0051O0NIE,Stephen,"[0, 0]","Welcome to Hell's Kitchen!!  WARNING...SOME SPOILERS........I've have all seasons up to season 6 and thinking about getting season seven real soon.This was a memorable season mostly for the good things, and also for the bad stuff....I'll explain in a few....Before that, there are similarities that I have noticed throughout the seasons that stay there, that stay throghout that fans can easily pick up on. It takes away from the originality that is the show.- The first thing the inspired chefs do is create their signature dish. (one actually made slices of french toast? no one can be that dumb, can they?)- Competitions between the men and women that requires 5 points always seem to come down to the final vote.- There are always idiotic characters that seem to stay for a long time (this year....TINELLE) it seems for popularity purposes. (more on her later)- There is always a punishment consisting of either shopping and/or prepping the dinner service for tonight- the first couple of times Gordan Ramsay always shuts down the kitchen (do the guests--I meant ACTORS (lol) get meal vouchers or something as a result?)- there are always a few guests returning their food to the kitchen and something is always coming to the pass as raw. (How do you cook scallops that are raw, or chicken in the first place? wow..purely there for suspense)- you have a pretty good idea who would win Hell's Kitchen when they all got their black jackets (I won't tell you who here) :)I know there are more....but you can see where I'm going with this...It seemed like the chef Robert was going to be on the show from the start and the chef who was thrown out was fodder. It seemed too convenient that in the opening sequence where the chefs are introduced in their funny animations that the chef that was thrown out was at the very end and could be easily replaced by Robert. I think it was planned. (as which a bunch of things in Hell's Kitchen, beforehand)Another thing: I think that when Robert had to ride this ridiculous 5 man bike with the rest of the chefs, it was intentional to get him off the show, as if he had something come up in real life, and thus, he was eventually eliminated a few episodes later. Robert is a great competitor who fought with his heart and did a great job.Okay..the Good...- The interactions were good and Ramsay was his usual self...- The characters for the most part were not lazy (like Lacey in season 5) and besides a few hotheads (Joseph and Van) they were mainly more cool and collected.- Above mentioned Joseph. He seriously wanted to fight Gordan Ramsay? I personally think it was staged and he had a emergency (it has happened before, refer back to season one...one actually had to leave due to medical injury)It was still fun to watch but I knew that all the ""chefs"" sign agreements not to go after him or try to injure him beforehand)- Van was a loudmouth but he wasn't as bad as others.The Bad:TINELLE!!!!!Oh my God...it is like adding ""ghetto"" to the show with her many outbursts and her selfish nature as she thinks it's all about her. While she wasn't nearly as bad as that awful loudmouth (I think from season four....Rachael I think....that gave me a headache from all her constant idiotic statements and acting like she has an IQ of a peanut)She smiled when Suzanne was eliminated and she also wouldn't shut up during one elimination round which got Gordan to tell her politely to shut up.Final thing....all hell's Kitchen fans know the final 8 return. Where was Tinelle? Was she a poor loser and refused to return? I think that was the case. The others return and help out one last time and usually with good grace....I would give it five stars if it wasn't for Tinelle.Good season.....",4,Good season...one of the best....except for one chef who was too annoying...,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,3727,"['Welcome', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'WARNING', 'SOME', 'SPOILERS', '..I', ""'ve"", 'have', 'seasons', 'season', '6', 'thinking', 'getting', 'season', 'seven', 'real', 'soon.This', 'was', 'memorable', 'season', 'mostly', 'good', 'things', 'also', 'bad', 'stuff', '.I', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'few', '.Before', 'are', 'similarities', 'have', 'noticed', 'seasons', 'stay', 'there', 'stay', 'fans', 'can', 'easily', 'pick', 'up', 'away', 'originality', 'show.-', 'first', 'thing', 'inspired', 'chefs', 'do', 'create', 'signature', 'dish', 'one', 'actually', 'made', 'slices', 'french', 'toast', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'dumb', 'can', 'Competitions', 'men', 'women', '5', 'points', 'always', 'seem', 'come', 'down', 'final', 'vote.-', 'are', 'always', 'idiotic', 'characters', 'seem', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'year', '.TINELLE', 'popularity', 'purposes', 'more', 'later', 'always', 'punishment', 'consisting', 'shopping', 'and/or', 'prepping', 'dinner', 'service', 'tonight-', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'Gordan', 'Ramsay', 'always', 'down', 'kitchen', 'do', 'guests', 'meant', 'ACTORS', 'lol', 'get', 'meal', 'vouchers', 'something', 'result', 'are', 'always', 'few', 'guests', 'returning', 'food', 'kitchen', 'something', 'always', 'coming', 'pass', 'raw', 'How', 'do', 'cook', 'scallops', 'are', 'raw', 'chicken', 'first', 'place', 'wow..purely', 'suspense', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'who', 'would', 'win', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'when', 'got', 'black', 'jackets', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'here', 'know', 'are', 'more', '.but', 'can', 'see', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'seemed', 'chef', 'Robert', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'show', 'start', 'chef', 'who', 'was', 'thrown', 'out', 'was', 'fodder', 'seemed', 'too', 'convenient', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'chefs', 'are', 'introduced', 'funny', 'animations', 'chef', 'was', 'thrown', 'out', 'was', 'very', 'end', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'replaced', 'Robert', 'think', 'was', 'planned', 'bunch', 'things', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'beforehand', 'thing', 'think', 'when', 'Robert', 'had', 'ride', 'ridiculous', '5', 'man', 'bike', 'rest', 'chefs', 'was', 'intentional', 'get', 'off', 'show', 'had', 'something', 'come', 'up', 'real', 'life', 'thus', 'was', 'eventually', 'eliminated', 'few', 'episodes', 'later', 'Robert', 'great', 'competitor', 'who', 'fought', 'heart', 'did', 'great', 'job.Okay..the', 'Good', 'interactions', 'were', 'good', 'Ramsay', 'was', 'usual', 'self', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'not', 'lazy', 'Lacey', 'season', '5', 'few', 'hotheads', 'Joseph', 'Van', 'were', 'mainly', 'more', 'cool', 'collected.-', 'Above', 'mentioned', 'Joseph', 'seriously', 'wanted', 'fight', 'Gordan', 'Ramsay', 'personally', 'think', 'was', 'staged', 'had', 'emergency', 'happened', 'refer', 'back', 'season', 'one', 'one', 'actually', 'had', 'leave', 'due', 'medical', 'injury', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'knew', 'chefs', 'sign', 'agreements', 'not', 'go', 'try', 'injure', 'beforehand', 'Van', 'was', 'loudmouth', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'others.The', 'Bad', 'TINELLE', 'Oh', 'God', 'adding', 'ghetto', 'show', 'many', 'outbursts', 'selfish', 'nature', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'awful', 'loudmouth', 'think', 'season', 'four', '.Rachael', 'think', 'gave', 'headache', 'constant', 'idiotic', 'statements', 'acting', 'IQ', 'peanut', 'smiled', 'when', 'Suzanne', 'was', 'eliminated', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'shut', 'up', 'one', 'elimination', 'round', 'got', 'Gordan', 'tell', 'politely', 'shut', 'up.Final', 'thing', '.all', 'hell', 'Kitchen', 'fans', 'know', 'final', '8', 'return', 'Where', 'was', 'Tinelle', 'Was', 'poor', 'loser', 'refused', 'return', 'think', 'was', 'case', 'others', 'return', 'help', 'out', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'usually', 'good', 'grace', '.I', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'Tinelle.Good', 'season', '..']",N/A
