1275725,A3JY8W7DFFUGOP,B002L45FT4,Alex Bates,"[5, 13]","This poorly crafted documentary is like a parody of itself. It loosely explores possible correlations between The Book of Revelations and a coming apocalypse based on things like recent weather patterns, economic conditions, etc. If you are okay with zero science then this might be for you. The host repeatedly asks people such thought provoking questions as, ""If millions of people just disappeared without a trace, what do you think would be the cause of it?"" Hmmm...
