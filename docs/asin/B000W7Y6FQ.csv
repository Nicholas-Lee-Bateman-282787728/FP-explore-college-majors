The central human characters have solid personnalities and the lead man has a decent storyline.Two completely non-humanoid creatures fighting seems very ambitious by the standards of what I've seen before. Unfortunately, their fight is (understandably, I guess) only a small part of the movie.As a fan of Toei's Super Sentai series, though, a lot of footage of which was used in ""Power Rangers"", I ghonestly think Toei did a lot better with that battle than with a lot of the giant monster battles they're making even now.The Pterosaur isn't even introduced until near the end and because of that I wasn't going to give the movie more than three stars. But after the Pterosaur's debut, I thought what the heck, that is a really awesome Pterosaur, hence the higher rating.I'm assuming movies like this were common after the end of the Showa Godzilla series; a lot of filmmakers probably saw a void they wanted to fill.",4,Ambitious and not what I was expecting,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,1045,"['monsters', 'movie', 'get', 'lot', 'less', 'focus', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'kaiju', 'films', 'lot', 'more', 'atmosphere', 'such', 'central', 'human', 'characters', 'have', 'solid', 'personnalities', 'lead', 'man', 'decent', 'storyline.Two', 'completely', 'non-humanoid', 'creatures', 'fighting', 'very', 'ambitious', 'standards', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Unfortunately', 'fight', 'understandably', 'guess', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'movie.As', 'fan', 'Toei', 'Super', 'Sentai', 'series', 'lot', 'footage', 'was', 'used', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'ghonestly', 'think', 'Toei', 'did', 'lot', 'better', 'battle', 'lot', 'giant', 'monster', ""'re"", 'making', 'even', 'now.The', 'Pterosaur', ""n't"", 'even', 'introduced', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'Pterosaur', 'debut', 'thought', 'what', 'heck', 'really', 'awesome', 'Pterosaur', 'hence', 'higher', 'rating.I', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'movies', 'were', 'common', 'end', 'Showa', 'Godzilla', 'series', 'lot', 'filmmakers', 'probably', 'saw', 'void', 'wanted', 'fill']",N/A

1107291,AGUYCPQE4X6A9,B000W7Y6FQ,Gus in New Mexico,"[0, 0]","Like several other of the reviewers on this page I too was scarred for life when my parents rented Legend of the Dinosaurs from the Kid's Section at Blockbuster so I could watch what the video box proclaimed was ""Just for Kids!"" (Good ol' Sandy Frank)I made it to the infamous raft scene which is certainly not for the kiddies before my parents noticed and took it back to Blockbuster with some serious complaints. After seeing that film I was too terrified to enter a bathtub much less a swimming pool, but on the plus side the film was so terrifiying that when I saw Jaws (which inspired this Japanese film consequently) years later it wasn't even scary.Years later I saw this film again as a ten year old and loved it! True, the ol' plesiousaur model didn't hold up as well as when I was four, but the film still managed to chalk up some scares and I still say its ten times as scary as Jaws. In watching the film all the way through I was delighted to find it also contained a Rhamphoryncus (the Moster Bird of the title). Unfortunately the end fight between the two monster marionettes nearly ruins the film and the plesiosaur goes from being seriously scary to pretty goofy looking on land. It's still a fun flick to watch as an adult, and the ""stalking of the raft"" scene is still as creepy as ever.The DVD is excellent and uncut and comes complete with two trailers which if you watch slowly you can check out some unused SPFX footage. Plus, this is not the Sandy Frank version from your childhood, it has a few brief additional scenes and the opening credits are different since we are treated to the original Japanese print rather than the US one. For those of you who didn't read the DVD specifics you can watch it in English or Japanese with subs.Anyhow if you're an adult who saw it as a kid the film is still fun to watch (pretty artful direction and interesting music). If you're a parent who wants to scare your child out of swimming (and bathing), well just show them this DVD.",5,Legend of the Dinosaurs (and one Monster Bird),1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,1994,"['several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'page', 'too', 'was', 'scarred', 'life', 'when', 'parents', 'rented', 'Legend', 'Dinosaurs', 'Kid', 'Section', 'Blockbuster', 'could', 'watch', 'what', 'video', 'box', 'proclaimed', 'was', 'Just', 'Kids', 'Good', 'ol', 'Sandy', 'Frank', 'made', 'infamous', 'raft', 'scene', 'certainly', 'not', 'kiddies', 'parents', 'noticed', 'took', 'back', 'Blockbuster', 'serious', 'complaints', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'terrified', 'enter', 'bathtub', 'much', 'less', 'swimming', 'pool', 'plus', 'side', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'terrifiying', 'when', 'saw', 'Jaws', 'inspired', 'Japanese', 'film', 'consequently', 'years', 'later', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'scary.Years', 'later', 'saw', 'film', 'again', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'loved', 'True', 'ol', 'plesiousaur', 'model', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'was', 'four', 'film', 'still', 'managed', 'chalk', 'up', 'scares', 'still', 'say', 'ten', 'times', 'as', 'scary', 'Jaws', 'watching', 'film', 'way', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'also', 'contained', 'Rhamphoryncus', 'Moster', 'Bird', 'title', 'Unfortunately', 'end', 'fight', 'two', 'monster', 'marionettes', 'nearly', 'film', 'plesiosaur', 'being', 'seriously', 'scary', 'pretty', 'goofy', 'looking', 'land', 'still', 'fun', 'flick', 'watch', 'adult', 'stalking', 'raft', 'scene', 'still', 'as', 'creepy', 'ever.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'uncut', 'complete', 'two', 'trailers', 'watch', 'slowly', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'unused', 'SPFX', 'footage', 'not', 'Sandy', 'Frank', 'version', 'childhood', 'few', 'brief', 'additional', 'scenes', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'different', 'are', 'treated', 'original', 'Japanese', 'print', 'rather', 'US', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'DVD', 'specifics', 'can', 'watch', 'English', 'Japanese', 'subs.Anyhow', ""'re"", 'adult', 'who', 'saw', 'kid', 'film', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'pretty', 'artful', 'direction', 'interesting', 'music', ""'re"", 'parent', 'who', 'scare', 'child', 'swimming', 'bathing', 'well', 'just', 'show', 'DVD']",N/A
1107292,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B000W7Y6FQ,Joshua Koppel,"[3, 3]","The music in this film will bring back memories of Godzilla and a Smog Monster but the action is more along the lines of more classic Toho features.  Here we have two giant monsters, a plesiosaur and a pterodactyl, a crazy music score, and a strange premise.A young scientist is trying to prove that his father's theories are correct and that he was not crazy.  The two believe that dinosaurs have managed to survive to modern day.  When the giant plesiosaur makes its appearances he looks like he is being proved right.  Suddenly a giant pterodactyl also makes an appearance.  Both of these creatures (neither one is actually a dinosaur) are far larger than they really were.  The film ends when the two monsters run into one another and have a typical monster brawl.  Oddly enough this occurs deep in a forest (what's the plesiosaur doing out of water?  How does the pterodactyl fit between the trees and under the treetops?).All in all this is a pretty fun giant monster kaiju film.  The monsters are just big, no powers of any sort.  The final scene, involving a volcano, may be a bit too long for the action, but otherwise I really enjoyed this one.  It was good to see a ""new"" corny kaiju film (think Godzilla's Revenge) as opposed to the more modern, but wonderful, releases.  A bit of a trip down memory lane.

Gorey ""Behemoth""","[1, 2]","Can't imagine who the audience must have been for this macabre hybrid of musical/monster movie/surreal journey into Z-grade filmmaking. Is it even possible this was meant to be taken seriously when it was made, or is it all just a clever put-on: a spoof of the genre by winking jokesters? Fans of Japanese monster films might want to avoid this for several reasons: the creatures are, to be kind, from hunger--and their action scenes are few and far between. As for the rest? It's either the worst kind of mess or it's brilliant, depending upon your state of inebriation or tolerance.

Sure it had some bits taken out because of the gore factor. But that did not stop it from being a worthwhile scarefest. How would you react if a pleasiasaur's head popped out of a lake right next to you, with its mouth wide open with sharp teeth? (And I am referring to the raft murder scene with the girl). Bear in mind that I'm not too fond that they had a cute little dog involved in this movie. I mean, it made me think they were going to have it killed or eaten or worse and that really doesn't sit good with me. I urge you all to try it if you are in the mood for a good scare and a trip down memory lane.
