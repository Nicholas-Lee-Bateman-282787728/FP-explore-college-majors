1427300,A1ITCVZ46MUB3A,B004SGWYWE,A Hot Whizzer Summer...,"[2, 4]","Demon King Daimao is about a man who wants to do good in the world, but after a personality review, is fated to become the Demon King destined to destroy everything.The story starts out with a great deal of fanservice. The first 6 episodes of the 12 episode series consists of copious amounts of nudity, panty shots, fighting, and flirtatious girls. The series also starts out quite funny, with a constant stream of jokes as Akuto (The main character/Demon King) deals with a bunch of girls with odd personalities throwing themselves at him.The story also drops into Anime Cliches. You have the overly jealous girl who is secretly in love with the clueless hero, the overly slutty girl who is also in love with the clueless hero, monsters, robots, and they even manage to slip in the customary beach episode that so many anime seem to include.About halfway through story the fanservice starts to drop and it is mostly storyline and fighting. One of the best things I can say about the series is that it had a very good pace. The story moves forward well and doesn't get side tract, even with the fanservice, which is built into the story rather than beside it.The bad things about the story is that it is very confusing to follow. The story starts out OK, but by the end you have a great deal of trouble figuring out what is going on. In the last 2 episodes several characters suddenly show up out of nowhere, and then you have battles where you have no clue who is on whose side. Even the end is confusing.If you can put the confusing plot aside, the show is actually pretty funny. The android Kerone constantly messes with him, his friend Kena is a crazy clepto who spends most of the show naked (so she can be invisible), and his love interest borderline hates him for most of the show.It's a fun ride for the fanservice if nothing else. I enjoyed the show. It's a complicated story and is hard to follow, but it had a better flow than the previous anime I had watched. I would probably say it is 3.5 stars, but as that is not possible, 4 it is.",4,An Interesting Anime Series,1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,2048,"['Demon', 'King', 'Daimao', 'man', 'who', 'do', 'good', 'world', 'personality', 'review', 'fated', 'become', 'Demon', 'King', 'destined', 'destroy', 'everything.The', 'story', 'out', 'great', 'deal', 'fanservice', 'first', '6', 'episodes', '12', 'episode', 'series', 'copious', 'amounts', 'nudity', 'panty', 'shots', 'fighting', 'flirtatious', 'girls', 'series', 'also', 'out', 'quite', 'funny', 'constant', 'stream', 'jokes', 'Akuto', 'main', 'character/Demon', 'King', 'bunch', 'girls', 'odd', 'personalities', 'throwing', 'him.The', 'story', 'also', 'Anime', 'Cliches', 'have', 'overly', 'jealous', 'girl', 'who', 'secretly', 'love', 'clueless', 'hero', 'overly', 'slutty', 'girl', 'who', 'also', 'love', 'clueless', 'hero', 'monsters', 'robots', 'even', 'manage', 'slip', 'customary', 'beach', 'episode', 'so', 'many', 'anime', 'seem', 'include.About', 'halfway', 'story', 'fanservice', 'drop', 'mostly', 'storyline', 'fighting', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'series', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'story', 'forward', 'well', ""n't"", 'get', 'side', 'tract', 'even', 'fanservice', 'built', 'story', 'rather', 'beside', 'it.The', 'bad', 'things', 'story', 'very', 'confusing', 'follow', 'story', 'out', 'OK', 'end', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'last', '2', 'episodes', 'several', 'characters', 'suddenly', 'show', 'up', 'nowhere', 'then', 'have', 'battles', 'where', 'have', 'clue', 'who', 'side', 'Even', 'end', 'confusing.If', 'can', 'put', 'confusing', 'plot', 'aside', 'show', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'android', 'Kerone', 'constantly', 'messes', 'friend', 'Kena', 'crazy', 'clepto', 'who', 'most', 'show', 'naked', 'can', 'be', 'invisible', 'love', 'interest', 'borderline', 'most', 'show.It', 'fun', 'ride', 'fanservice', 'nothing', 'else', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'complicated', 'story', 'hard', 'follow', 'had', 'better', 'flow', 'previous', 'anime', 'had', 'watched', 'would', 'probably', 'say', '3.5', 'stars', 'not', 'possible', '4']",Demon King Daimao: Complete Collection

He's gonna have a hard time achieving his dream, and staying alive.This anime has really good production quality. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all really well done. The story is fun, funny, and really perverted. There is a lot of nudity, and pervy stuff. Needless to say there isn't much of a plot in this anime, but it's fun. It doesn't really need one. Where most of these harem animes get a little more heated up at the end, I sort of felt a little let down at the end of this one.

1427313,AKYP06R981T5B,B004SGWYWE,Paul,"[9, 16]","Demon King Daimao is a true disappointment. It has likeable characters, an interesting world and starts off with a great premise in an alternate world of technology and magic. But it totally falls apart in its 2nd half, trying to fit waaaaay too much story into the last 6 episodes, getting away from what was fun about this series. It also suffers on the sub track from dubious translation and localization.Sai Akuto, abandoned as a child at a church, is transfering to the Constant Magick Academy, the world's foremost magic school, when, following a misunderstanding, which gets us a nice panty shot, he meets fellow freshman, Junko Hattori, a girl as driven to justice as she is pretty (her family is a ninja clan, in service to the deity Suhara). Junko is impressed by the good-hearted Sai, and the two decide to become friends with the goal of improving the world. Junko doesn't take such vows lightly, and if the vow is broken, the other must kill the offender. However, Sai's dream of becoming a high priest dedicated to helping the world comes to a crashing stop when he goes for his entrance health exam with the school nurse, who also turns out to be his homeroom teacher. See, this being a magical world, it's a magical health exam by a prophetic crow which also tells you your future job profession, and has never been wrong. Sai's future career: Demon King. Naturally, everyone freaks. The last demon king 100 years ago, caused a terrible war. Needless to say, Junko, who turns out to be in his new class, isn't happy, and afterwards, just about everything Sai says is taken the wrong way, with everyone assuming and misinterpreting the worst everything Sai says or does. An enraged Junko tries to kill him, but he is helped by a flying girl, another classmate, Kena Soga, a bubbly airhead who is a sweet-natured girl (with an obsessive love of rice) who can also turn her body invisible, though not her clothing, which she has to remove to be untrackable. Entering into this mix is Korone, a female android sent to observe him from the government, and Fujiko Eto, a seemingly good girl who's actually a black mage who wants to control the future Demon King, and who keeps company with the talking head of her dead brother. Throw in the Student Council President and the 3 other girls who are on the Student Council, homeroom teacher/nurse Mitsuko Tori who keeps hoping Sai will get killed so that she can turn him into a zombie to fully examine his nature, and ""helpful"" classmate Hiroshi Miwa, whose eagerness to help the future Demon King lead to further misunderstandings, and we've got a large cast to fit into a 12 episode series, but a fun universe to explore.Oh, the cover? Left to Right, that's green-haired Korone, red-haired Kena and blue-haired Junko.Lot's of fun to be had here, plus fun fan service from a girl who has to get naked to be invisible, an android with a dry sense of humor, the embarassment of good and noble Junko as she's caught up in all this, plus twisted fun from ""bad"" girl Fujiko, all while exploring a great alternate universe.And then it all collapses after about the 6th episode. Instead of concentrating on the fun aspects, they throw in a whole bunch of incomprehensible storyline about someone trying to control the gods, someone trying to destroy the gods, the gods want to destroy the Demon King, no, they created the Demon King to destroy humanity, no, humanity created the concept of the gods, blah, blah, blah. Add into the mix a murderous time traveller, another girl, this one a truly bad girl, magical ninja clan loyalties, Junko's kid sister (a ninja girl who's a media idol), Hiroshi's town's prophecy of a hero to face the Demon King, and it just is an absolute mess. The story contradicates itself, showing a young Sai declaring there's no such thing as god, compared to him wanting to be a high priest when we first met him. It's not helped by what seems to be a poorly subtitled show. For instance, it refers to omiai as being an arranged marriage, when it's actually an interview for people who are seeking an arranged marriage. Sloppy work here.But the main problem with this show is that it first gets away from what works, harem fun in a great alternate universe, and tries to cram about 18 episodes worth of story into the last 5 episodes. You can almost see the writers and production staff saying, ""Screw re-writing this for a proper story to be told in 12 episodes, lets just pull random plot points out of our posterior for the last half of the show!"" Plot point after plot point is introduced in the last 5 episodes without any foundation whatsoever, and the show collapses under the weight of all this nonsense.Which is a shame, since there are some fun characters here, and this was a great premise. Through the first 6 episodes I'd give it 4 stars, the last half of the series gets 1 star if I'm feeling overly generous. 2 stars doesn't begin to reveal what a mess the 2nd half of this show is. Despite some nice fan service (yes, we have bare booty and boobies, with nipples, on the gals), there are plenty of better fan service shows out there. This show is an enourmous waste of potential and a waste of some good and fun characters.",2,"Starts Well, But Disintegrates In the 2nd Half",1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,5217,"['Demon', 'King',

Obviously the misconceptions about the main character start off right away especially after his fumbling on trying to dissuade the other students paranoia about him that backfires enormously causing hi jinx and other problems for our well intentioned male character.  Of course you can't have this kind of series without the love interest for our beloved character and so he starts to pickup unintentionally a group of attractive and some well endowed females all who wish to be with him for different reasons.  The series will of course also give you a high dose of fan-service but if you've seen the trailers an the like that's pretty much expected,  the series is only twelve episodes and does feel a little to short but the ending is decent enough you won't feel to annoyed with it.  The voice cast for the Japanese subbed audio did superbly with their character roles and I liked for the most part the English dubbed version as well especially with the duo team up with Luci Christian and Chris Patton who always seem to work well together especially when their characters are the main couple and while the rest of the dubbed cast were decent there are a few that seemed to fall flat but it's hard to tell if they're newcomers to the anime industry and just need time to perfect their skills or just didn't have the acting skills at all.  So for any fan of the supernatural action combo with a nice touch of fan-service or just looking for an entertaining series here's one to try out....",5,An Enjoyable Magical Supernatural Harem But Not With To Much Depth,1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,1990,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'harem', 'animes', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'surprise', 'series', 'feels', 'mix', 'Maburaho/Love', 'Hina/Samurai', 'Deeper', 'Kyo', 'where', 'have', 'characters', 'going', 'school', 'where', 'most', 'students', 'study', 'have', 'intense', 'magical', 'physical', 'abilities', 'norm', 'then', 'have', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'who', 'fumbling', 'accidental', 'introductions', 'out', 'supposed', 'destiny', 'be', 'new', 'demon', 'king', 'was', 'feared', 'hated', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'Obviously', 'misconceptions', 'main', 'character', 'start', 'right', 'away', 'especially', 'fumbling', 'trying', 'dissuade', 'other', 'students', 'paranoia', 'enormously', 'causing', 'hi', 'jinx', 'other', 'problems', 'well', 'intentioned', 'male', 'character', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'series', 'love', 'interest', 'beloved', 'character', 'so', 'pickup', 'unintentionally', 'group', 'attractive', 'well', 'endowed', 'females', 'who', 'wish', 'be', 'different', 'reasons', 'series', 'will', 'course', 'also', 'give', 'high', 'dose', 'fan-service', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailers', 'like', 'pretty', 'much', 'expected', 'series', 'only', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'feel', 'little', 'short', 'ending', 'decent', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'annoyed', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'subbed', 'audio', 'did', 'superbly', 'character', 'roles', 'liked', 'most', 'part', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'duo', 'team', 'up', 'Luci', 'Christian', 'Chris', 'Patton', 'who', 'always', 'seem', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'especially', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'main', 'couple', 'rest', 'dubbed', 'cast', 'were', 'decent', 'are', 'few', 'seemed', 'fall', 'flat', 'hard', 'tell', ""'re"", 'newcomers', 'anime', 'industry', 'just', 'need', 'time', 'perfect', 'skills', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'acting', 'skills', 'So', 'fan', 'supernatural', 'action', 'combo', 'nice', 'touch', 'fan-service', 'just', 'looking', 'entertaining', 'series', 'here', 'one', 'try', 'out']",Demon King Daimao: Complete Collection

1427316,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B004SGWYWE,S. Der,"[20, 22]","I agree with most of the reviews here. The anime started out great. The story line was great. They had a bunch of great characters and development of them was nicely done. Then, half way through it, they picked up and rush too much information in way too fast. I seriously don't know how to explain it in words. It's like they literally didn't want to do leave the fans hanging so they finish it, but only put in all the main plots of the story in, but you would had to read the books before hand to know what's really going on because it's was on fast forward times 8!I mainly want to say, this anime should had been two seasons, but I guess they saw there wasn't going to be another season after, and so, they had to pick and choose what to tell us to finish it. Again, this wasn't a good or bad idea. It's good for people that already know the story and bad for people that don't know it at all.Honestly at the very end, I didn't know what was going on? It seemed like they were talking about a lot information that came up to that very point, but the thing is...they never told us anything!!! They, just skipped to the end. I'm not kidding either. It was Climax scene to climax scene to climax scene. I was left feeling ???????????? It just went from what seemed like the middle of the series to the end in one and half episodes. There were a 2 or 3 more characters that came out at the end and it seemed like they were important characters that needed to be explained. I mean, they looked super important to the whole series, but I was left feeling, okay, this guy knows everything and he talking a whole of lot information, and now I see the final battle. Who are you? Were you the main villain? Were you just the secret villain? Were you the guy that just came out of nowhere? Why are you here? Why are you fighting that dude? Ahh...I want to know! It looks cool, but I just don't know what's happening. So sad.Also, it is confusing to know who was the good guy or bad guy in story. I kept watching it and didn't know what was going on and didn't feel anything towards the end, but confused and rip offed. It was never told who was the ""REAL Villain"" and it will never will be now. One of the main story lines was the Demon King and he like an anti-hero, but maybe, he was the villain really at the end? I don't know. I can't come to a conclusion on a show 8 times fast-forward. lolThe ending doesn't make any sense. Since, we don't know anything. How could it? It's like one minute, you're in the middle of the season and the next show your in the middle half, then the next show your at the ending. So many things weren't explained and I had no clue to what to get out of it. I could see how they got the happy ending, probably, but I don't really know if that's was supposed to be a happy ending or not. I'm just pissed!This series could had easily been 5 stars. No problem. It just never had the chance to developed into it. Good for people that already know the story, otherwise, stay far-far away from this one.

1427318,A3B8DR4BWZJBQQ,B004SGWYWE,SR9,"[2, 8]","To be entirely fair, my experience with this series is the U.S. released, English dubbed version. I want to be as objective as possible, but in 20+ years of enjoying anime of multiple genres, I can honestly say that in my personal experience, only a few have gone from mediocre to terrible so fast.Demon King Daimao/Ichiban Ushiro no Dai Mao is a story about Akuto Sai, a nice guy attending a magical school, where he is saddled with the predicted future role of being the destructive Demon King. Cue the fights, school-age romance elements, lots of nudity... and more fights. Obviously, this anime is supposed to be a silly T&A; romp like many others. It starts out with a predictable and fun enough premise, and a handful of interesting characters. Gratuitous nudity and sexual situations are par for the course, flirting at the edge of soft-core anime porn at times.All of that is fine, if you know what you're getting into with a series like this. What blew me away was the sudden drop from mediocre and silly fun to abysmal, confusing nonsense. Demon King Daimao was not a unique and outstanding series to begin with - it seems to take a piece from every anime sub-genre stereotype and slap them all together. Shojo meets occult, adds mecha, and showers in fan service.But after the first half of the series, the episodes become a giant cluster of new plots and characters crammed on top of each other. The plots randomly multiply without explanation, add some jargon, roles and terminology that are never explained, and all before you can pause and scratch your head.Add to this the fact that somehow, the writing/dialogue gets progressively worse than ever before, until the seriously said line: ""It makes me cry demon king tears"" slayed me and made me stop very near the end of the series. Wow. I didn't pay to watch this series, and I am relieved. There are so many entertaining, equally gratuitous series out there that won't let the viewer down like this.
