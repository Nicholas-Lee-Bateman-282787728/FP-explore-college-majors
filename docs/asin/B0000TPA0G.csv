The thing is that we liked it very much. A great supernatural thriller with a great cast and performances. To be honest, by the theatrical trailer I've seen on the movies, I thought this was going to be very scary like THE SIXTH SENSE. But even though it didn't freak me out, I enjoyed it. There are very strange dialogues int the movie. There is very little action and horror, but very interesting overall.

783262,A34R3PM9KEWNZS,B0000TPA0G,__Alessandro__,"[8, 20]","[...]I had not seen it before today, when it was broadcast on television. Its theological confusion was evident from the first 2 minutes of watching. A sin eater? Hmmm... The main character says, ""I now hold the keys to heaven."" Uhmmm... Priests already hold the keys to heaven... duh! Jesus granted that power to St. Peter, the Apostles and their successors (priests) when he said, ""That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.  And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven"" (Mt. 16:18-19). Even from the get-go, then, the movie is flawed.Let me simply cite the review from the U.S. Congress of Catholic Bishops, which summarizes the situation well:""Problematic supernatural thriller about a maverick Catholic priest (Heath Ledger), who, while investigating his spiritual mentor's alleged suicide, travels to Rome in order to hunt down the sole remaining practitioner of an arcane medieval ritual known as ""sin eating,"" a rite by which a person can receive absolution without recourse to sacramental confession. Wrapped in a convoluted story, the film, directed by Brian Helgeland, is full of egregious theological distortions and bogus stereotypes targeted at painting the church and its clergy as callous, corrupt and ultimately the root of all evil. A warped view of church doctrine, a shadowy sexual encounter with partial nudity, a suicide, recurring violence including ritual murder, and sporadic rough and crude language, as well as profanity.""

783263,A1ZLFCUF4XX7RZ,B0000TPA0G,Alex,"[0, 0]","This is a movie that you can't stop in the middle and do something else. I made that mistake and it lost its whole spell on me.Having said that it's a pretty OK movie where evil and Catholicism are concerned. Heath Ledger's character is a priest whose mentor has died. Not that's a problem itself, but he's been excommunicated and cannot be buried in holy ground because of this. Alex, Ledger's character, does it anyway, but not before noticing that there are marks on his body that correspond to that of a Sin Eater, a human who can offer absolution outside of the Catholic Church. That's obviously a huge no no.The plot is about him trying to find the Sin Eater and destroy him, but the ending holds a nice twist that you probably weren't looking for. It's a bit weird though. I wouldn't have ended the film like that.I don't think this is Ledger's finest work, but it's not bad. He was a very good actor, one whose films I'll continue to watch for years to come. I felt that Sossamon's character of Mara was very underused. I wish there would have been more of her in this film.It's a good film if you like dark suspense, and dark films. It's definately not for those who don't like to see Catholicism in a bad light, but I didn't feel it was shown negatively, only that some within the Church are evil as opposed to the entire thing.I will say this, and this is a spoiler, the choice to use Peter Weller in the second role, or at least his voice, was a very bad idea.

783264,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,B0000TPA0G,Alexiel,"[8, 10]","I love dark, atmospheric, Romantic films with a gothic flair. So when I heard the reviews of this film being so cruel when it first came out, I was thinking, &quot;Who cares, I'll probably like it just fine.&quot;But unfortunately, I don't.The premise of the order sounds fine. A mystery being called the Sin Eater goes around absolving people of their sins, but also killing people while it does so. So the Vatican Church has to send in its tactical strike squad (sounds like it could be something out of a Dan Brown book), aka Heath Ledger playing a young priest, to go destroy this Sin Eater; after all, the Sin Eater is horning in on church business here facilitating the relationship between Jesus and man in redemption. They can't have that.I have always been fascinated with the idea of priests as something like holy warriors fighting the forces of darkness, be it &quot;The Exorcist&quot; or comic books. This film unfortunately doesn't do much with the idea.First, let me say that the atmosphere set is very dark and Romantic (capital R), and I was pleased with it. You have every thing you'd expect from a movie like this - solemn priests, graveyards, ancient churches, demons, ravens, candle-light, a hushed air of mysterious menace - very fine stuff. The lighting is wonderfully evocative, and the sets and the costumes are all well done in my opinion.But little else is good. The acting... this is just my opinion, but it feels like little effort was put into the acting. The lines are delivered perfunctorily, with competence, yet I'm not really buying into it. Which was a shame, because I did want to. Heath Ledger in particularly was a big disappointment because generally I like his work. I thought Shannyn Sossamon was very fetching (She'd make me re-think my priestly vows) in an interesting role where she plays Ledger's &quot;love interest&quot; so to speak, an artist who was possessed in the past and even now may very well be quite disturbed.The pacing of the plot is bad. The movie stumbles and lurches, and doesn't ever really pick up. When you get right down to it, the story is threadbare and doesn't have a lot to work with it. Finally, I won't give anything away, but the last third or so of the movie is pretty terrible. Even halfway through the movie I was still optimistic, but I just thought toward the end it got really boring, contrived, and even ridiculous.The DVD extras aren't anything to write home about. Trailers, commentary, and some deleted scenes that actually really did add nothing and deserved to be cut. The commentary at least shows the director was enthusiastic about this project, which is commendable, but overall, this movie really was a letdown.",2,"Ouch.

It did not even make it to the theatres for any length of time, despite Heath Ledger starring in the central role.Occult/religious thrillers are not everyone's cup of tea. It can be said that some have a tendency towards the blasphemous, using bits of information, aspects of the bible, occult lore, half truths and fables etc, to then manipulate these stories to sell to modern audiences.After watching this film, it dawned on me that The Order plays on the growing disaffection within the Catholic Church. The modern church has indeed undergone many changes over the years, particularly since Vatican II. Many anti-Catholic publications have flooded the market place, hinting or downright accusing the church of Satanism. There is no proof of this, but its great fodder for the disaffected.Anyone not acquainted or trained in the tenets of the Catholic Church might have a difficult time understanding this film's basic premise. And that is, generally, any member of the church is entitled to what is called The Last Rights. On one's deathbed, the dieing will confess their sins to the acting priest, and thus cleansed of their transgressions, blessed and permitted into heaven. Those excommunicated from the Church forfeit these rights, thus absolution or forgiveness for their sins cannot be attained - therefore entry into God's presence is not permitted. The Sin Eater is Christian legend; a rebel angel or an appointed soul stands outside the dogma of the church, absolving those sinners, performing the Last Rights on the excommunicated, to ensure their entry into heaven. The film plays out this legend, however in a disturbing manner.One must ask the question: Is the Sin Eater good or evil? In certain stories, the appointed one is a tool for goodness and not affiliated with evil at all. They're around to pick up the pieces, so to speak, ensuring those wrongly excommunicated are permitted into heaven. However, in this film, this fabled figure is depicted as demonic, a satanic representative, a tool of the devil. In other words, the film implies that those operating outside Church dogma are automatically on the side of evil.Unfortunately, The Order had the potential to be an excellent film, a great film, but it settled on being a fair one.Heath Ledger is a very good actor and this film gave him the opportunity to explore his talent. He has certainly matured over the years, and it's a shame that he doesn't take on more projects. The Order was a curious choice on his part and I wonder about his actual motives for taking on this project, as it did not reach a large, mainstream audience.

He takes along his troubled ""friend,"" Mara (Shannyn Sossamon) and remaining Carolingian Thomas Garrett (comedian Mark Addy).  Alex uncovers some disturbing facts ... his mentor did not commit suicide, but was killed by a Sineater--a being with the power to absolve mortals of their sins outside the rule of the church.  Alex realizes his true calling and must continually make difficult decisions that take him farther away from those he loves and his ideals.The concept is what hooked me, and I also believe Ledger was a talented actor.  But even in this film his character shifts so drastically that I became confused.  The beginning was so well done: mysterious with artful cinematography.  The middle collapsed under a sad love subplot and the unveiling of the film's many intrigues.  The resolutions were weak and predictable.  The other actors were terrible.  Mara was a contrived mess, while Thomas was a little too much of the jokester (who happened to stumble upon important truths, but always too late).Overall, it was disappointing because the film is too formulaic for possessing a storyline with such potential and intelligence.",2,"Interesting storyline, just executed badly",1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,1433,"['have', 'seen', 'mere', 'pieces', 'film', 'past', 'year', 'finally', 'watched', 'once', 'was', 'disappointing.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'priest', 'Carolingian', 'order', 'kills', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Alex', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'must', 'go', 'Rome', 'investigate', 'death', 'troubled', 'friend', 'Mara', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'remaining', 'Carolingian', 'Thomas', 'Garrett', 'comedian', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Alex', 'disturbing', 'facts', 'mentor', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'suicide', 'was', 'killed', 'Sineater', 'being', 'power', 'absolve', 'mortals', 'sins', 'rule', 'church', 'Alex', 'true', 'calling', 'must', 'continually', 'make', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'take', 'farther', 'away', 'ideals.The', 'concept', 'what', 'hooked', 'also', 'believe', 'Ledger', 'was', 'talented', 'actor', 'even', 'film', 'character', 'shifts', 'so', 'drastically', 'became', 'confused', 'beginning', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'mysterious', 'artful', 'cinematography', 'middle', 'collapsed', 'sad', 'love', 'subplot', 'unveiling', 'film', 'many', 'intrigues', 'resolutions', 'were', 'weak', 'predictable', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'terrible', 'Mara', 'was', 'contrived', 'mess', 'Thomas', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'jokester', 'who', 'happened', 'stumble', 'upon', 'important', 'truths', 'always', 'too', 'late', '.Overall', 'was', 'disappointing', 'film', 'too', 'formulaic', 'possessing', 'storyline', 'such', 'potential', 'intelligence']",The Order

It surely was creative and different and actually could be called original, but it had its problems.  The film's premise is nothing short of confusing and complex, it does make you think but not in a good way, you only can wonder what the heck this movie is about? Oh well here goes:Heath Ledger plays a priest named Alex Bernierwho is part of an order.  He soon learns that the head of the order has been murdered by an entity named the Sin Eater.  Bernier goes to Rome to investigate.  The movie does have some nice CGI, as well as Ledger in a more dramatic role and shows that he can actually act.  Writer/Producer/Director Brian Hegelend who made A Knight's Tale and worked with Ledger  is apparently struggling to make a good movie.  Though this film isn't horrible, it's definetly worth waiting for hitting the shelves at Blockbuster.  Also the some of the cast from A Knight's Tale are in The Order including Shannyn Sossamon and Mark Addy.  Though the film has the potential to be an initially intriguing thriller it mostly fails.  Though the films does have a few scary moments but stick with good horror, religious classics such as The Excorcist and The Omen.  Even if you're only into this one for Heath, it's not really worth it.  Stick to his better and more understandable work such as The Four Feathers and A Knight's Tale.The Order is rated R for Violent Images, Sexuality and Language.  The film does have some intense images including some bloody images and stabbings.  The sexuality is mild, mainly one breif scene of intimacy not really hardcore or explicit.

And while tormented priest-hero Father Alex Bernier (Heath Ledger) may be wrestling with maladies of the mind, body, and soul, he still manages to look like he just sauntered off a GQ cover shoot.What about the story itself? At the guts of ""The Order"" is the millennial-old tale of the Sin Eater, a being who takes upon himself the unconfessed sins of the dying, a kind of moral Vampire who is roaming, and killing, in modern day Rome.Creepy, scary, nasty stuff, right?Wrong. ""The Order"" started off smart, creepy and tight, but by the time the final credits rolled I looked worse than Linda Blair in the middle of her spider-climb.It's a stylish film, certainly: Director of Photography Nicola Pecorini has an eye for visual detail and wields a mean camera. The opening sequence---an elderly priest cycling over an ancient Roman bridge to a dissolute, desolate, demonic rendezvous---is very creepy. ""The Order"" has all the physical trappings of a classic: terror amid claustrophobic Roman alleyways, a wickedly pagan catacomb underground, corridors of power within the secretive Vatican, a forsaken Italian graveyard. And the actors summoned up give their all: Heath Ledger delivers as the jaded, faded, disillusioned Father Bernier; Benno Furman does what he has to do as Bill Eden; Mark Addy shines as the earthy, bawdy monk Thomas Garrett; Peter Weller has fun as the nefarious Driscoll.But it's all in vain: all the tricky camera shots and heartfelt acting can't exorcise this monster. ""The Order"" is one of those weird, affectless flicks where the whole is distinctly less than the sum of the parts. The underworld teeming beneath the vaults of Rome is fascinating, as is the mummery of the hanged man: all of this hints at deeper, darker mysteries to be plumbed, and cinematographer Nicola Pecorini employs the trippy camera-work that made the wigged-out ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" even trippier.It works here and there: the confrontation in a Roman graveyard with the diabolic is shivery, narcotic, effective. But Pecorini sinks beneath the dead weight of Helgeland's plodding, paint-by-numbers direction and the tedious script. The only thing ""The Order"" exorcised me of was about 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back.""The Order"" had potential but was served up dead on arrival.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","THE ORDER (2003, not to be confused with Van Damme's film of the same title) is one of those films I have watched and watched, time and again, only to see it actually looks worse each time I see it. It astonishes me I didn't review it earlier, but then I often experience some sort of mental block when it comes to this stupid film. I almost forgot to review it this time. And I've been watching it on occasion ever since it was new.I watch these kinds of films, sometimes multiple times, so I can catch the latest stupid thing I may have missed in my last viewing.Attempting to flesh out some sense of what the historical Cathars MIGHT have believed, this silly, desperate film describes 'sin-eaters' (think: Who Gives A Crap, Some Eerie Being Will 'Eat' My Sins Before I Die). That little snippet gives you an idea of how bad this thing is. Of course the sin-eater (Benno F&uuml;rmann, originally to be played by Vincent Cassel, who stormed off this leaking barge) that Father Alec (Ledger) is hunting will eventually convince him to take the job. It's tiring eating other people's sins, apparently. But wait! There's more!Not only do we have the stupid premise of Ledger's role which is of a priest belonging to the fictitious &#34;Carolingian&#34; order, whose job it is &#34;to fight all manner of undead&#34;. Peter Weller stars as Cardinal Driscoll, a truly evil suggestion modeled on an old Borgia, who pulls double duty as some weird masked crime lord called Shirac. This cardinal wants to be the next pope, the film suggests he may have poisoned the pope &#34;who is dying&#34;, and wants to be known as &#34;the dark pope&#34;. This man has Darth Vader issues. I love the review that said this film was written/directed by someone with attention deficit problems. And that is the least of its worries.Some of the silliest, most juvenile dialogue in decades is on offer here. The dopiest attempts at theo-paranormal nonsense add inadvertent laughs - but I'm glad this was at least smart enough to avoid levitating possessed people. Heath Ledger is the only element that really gives this an air of creepiness, because I can see in his eyes, he's creeped out having to act in this piece of garbage. The theology is really nonexistent, like a joke told daily by some obnoxious middle school brat.The Cathars deserve better: these renegade Christian monks balked at the imperial powermongering of the Catholic Church. They practiced 'salvation outside the Roman Church', and had a rite called the Consolamentum - terribly mocked in this film - which they offered to anyone seeking confession or extreme unction. No doubt lots of people were keeping these guys busy. They also delved into their Jewish heritage and became proud of it.This film always made me wonder what it would have been like if Tom Hanks had played Fr. Alex and they had eliminated the stupid, pointless girl from the storyline. After all, his lines were no better in THE DA VINCI CODE ....Please, read what a commenter had to say about my review. I insist you read it in full, since this commenter finds THE ORDER &#34;compelling&#34;: &#34;What this reviewer fails to understand is &#34;sin eating&#34; is a very old custom. In the Middle Ages, family of a deceased person would hire a &#34;sin eater&#34; to ensure the deceased person's soul would be received, by God, sinless ....This film just took up the old tradition as a premise and gave it a new spin. So, despite the dismissive attitude of the reviewer, there is history behind the premise of this film.&#34;... and there you have the anti-intellectual statement of the decade. See, this is gobbledygook as far as I can tell, and THE ORDER is based on the actions of the 'Parfait' priests of the Cathars, better known as Albigensians. As in The Albigensian Crusade.So may I conclude by warning you away from this, unless of course you like to watch the worst movies ever made. You know, one of the reasons this often is misdated as 2002 is that it was scheduled for release in 2002. But the effects were so laughable they had no choice but to take a year to redo the entire thing, making the release - I think - around January, 2003. Also, the main trio in this film were together in that other piece of garbage, A KNIGHT'S TALE.

783285,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B0000TPA0G,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[3, 3]","No lengthy customer's review of ""The Order"" (or, as it also has been titled, ""The Sin-Eater"") is needed here, on Amazon-U.S.'s WWW site; there are lots of quite good ones here, if one searches the multiple entries under both of the film's titles, and on Amazon-U.K. However, for quick and ready convenience of users who prefer to avoid longer comments about ""The Sin Eater"", I'll make some relatively brief remarks here. The film is of the occult Inner-Workings-of-the-Church (i.e. the Romish Catholic Church) genre, with lots of creepy motifs and bizarre, cinematically induced happenings. A young and very handsome priest, Fr. Alex (Heath Ledger's role), a wonderfully Latin-celebrating traditionalist (hooray!), is drawn, entranced, to the more hidden and occult byways of his Church.Alas, this fascination sucks Fr. Alex and his older, experienced Satan-fighting priestly cohort, Fr. Thomas (Mark Addy) deeply into realms, at the highest ecclesiastical level, of evil and superstition-brought-to-life. Fr. Alex ends up pursuing a ""sin eater"", one William Eden (played by Benno F&uuml;rmann, looking surprisingly comely and seductively dapper for this role, as the movie studio has costumed and cosmetically enhanced him), who is an aeons-old (but prime-life looking) occultist, who draws sin and condemnation to himself from excommunicated sinners about to face the end of their mortal lives, gaining for them forgiveness without God's ordained means of grace and sacraments. This is not exactly orthodox Christianity, namely Roman (and Eastern Rite) Catholic, Anglo-Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Lutheran, in case one does not know that already.Fr. Alex succumbs to the temptations of the flesh, permitting Ledger to shed some clothes to studly effect, although surely Ledger's fans would prefer to see much more of the beauteous surface, revealed to the camera to greater (and more intimate) extent, of that Australian star's buck-naked, appealingly svelte Anglo-Celtic body; Ledger undoubtedly had been one of the most undeniably sexy male actors of his generation.  The ensuing lovemaking is (even if more suggestively than explicitly) pretty ""hot"", if all too brief.Alas, Alex loses his gal, Mara (played by Shannyn Sossamon), anyway, to the treacherous misdoings of the sin-catcher. In forfeiting his priestly vows, the young priest has acceded to William Eden's blandishments of ""being a man rather than a priest"". His predicament leads Alex also to gain occult power, too, however unwillingly he at first has been seeking it on a conscious level; Alex seizes it in a moment of panic, thus being doomed to many centuries of bondage to the very potency which Eden gladly relinquishes to Alex for the peace of the grave for which Eden has come to yearn.Thus, things have gotten a bit complicated, needless to say; the sin-chewing Eden has slain Mara, the priest's beloved, and he has tricked Fr. Alex into accepting Eden's offer to exchange his own occult function with Alex, for the release from life that Eden so much desires. The interaction of Fr. Alex with William Eden, as well as the gradually intensifying relationship of Alex with Mara, are fascinating to watch, as these three masterly actors play this out with consummate dramatic skill, sensitivity, and nuance. As the movie ends, a new sin-eater, Alex himself, now sets out upon his centuries-to-come of work and, in doing so, thankfully, he foils the wicked schemes of an ambitiously scheming and mega-wicked, papacy-seeking cardinal.The film is visually gorgeous, with lots of Catholic artwork and ecclesiastical bling-bling, fine Roman architecture (pagan and, especially, Roman Catholic), and so forth to view. It makes for an enjoyable albeit eerie way to pass some time at the video-player and screen.",4,"Entertaining and Gripping, Gothic Ecclesiastical Thriller Which the Viewer Will Gobble up Even a Fr.

783286,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B0000TPA0G,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[1, 3]","This film has been thoroughly trashed by most of the critics. Yet the majority of the audience polls were shown to be positive. Brian Helgeland wrote it, produced it, and directed it. As a director, he has a short track record rife with innovation; as in his film A KNIGHT'S TALE. I feel that he is a promising artist who is still searching for his cinematic groove. His writing has been criticized as muddled and sophomoric. Yet this man wrote the screenplays for MYSTIC RIVER and L.A.CONFIDENTIAL. The fact that he had cast three of his principal actors, Heath Ledger, Shannyn Sossaman, &amp; Mark Addy from A KNIGHT'S TALE has been panned. Yet this methodology of artistic trust was never questioned when it was practiced by John Ford, Clint Eastwood, or Akira Kurosawa.The cinematography by Nicola Pecorini is drenched in shadow and shafts of sunlight peeking through slits in crumbling mortar. It is a dark vision, but it never feels claustophobic. Pecorini, a camera operator for over twenty years, helped to pioneer the steadicam. This may be the first time he functioned as the head lenser. Oddly, I feel that I am standing almost alone on a  hilltop, when I declare that I liked this movie.Heath Ledger, as Alex Bernier, the young rogue priest, does a fine job of blending a tenacious faith with a rebellious spirit. He is treated by the Catholic Church as an eccentric pariah. After all he preached in Latin, and always had his back to the congregation; part of his consciousness securily rooted in medieval mysticism. His mentor, father/brother Dominic, played by Francesco Carnecutt, had died mysteriously in Rome, and the Church had labeled it a suicide. Ledger was recruited by powerful American Cardinal ( Peter Weller, as Driscoll, who specializes in off-beat roles ), to travel to Rome and to seek out the truth of Dominic's death.Ledger gathers his team together. He is joined first by Shannyn Sossaman, as the gorgous tragic painter Mara Sinclair. Her role as Magdalene to his rogue rabbi is sometimes hard to comprehend. Perhaps part of the exposition had to be edited out. She loves a man who &quot;can not love me back.&quot;. She apparently fell in love with him after she tried to kill him. Alex had performed an exorcism on her brother, and in a chaotic frenzy, she lost control and attacked him. This cost her a year's incarceration in a mental institution. She emerged clear-eyed, and ready to martyr herself for love. She seemed to be a bit psychic as well. She felt that something &quot;terrible&quot; was going to happen to Alex, and she wanted to be with him. It must have been interesting for this actress to construct a backstory for this character. In the film, she became available for Alex's seduction and carnal transcendence into actual manhood; and then she was sacrificed like a beautiful dove, forcing Alex to accept his fate.Soon, Ledger is joined by his sole compeer, Mark Addy as father Thomas Garrett. They are the last remnants of their Caroligian Order. They have been trained as demon hunters and exorcists. We see a few lame encounters with demons. The effects are unspectacular, and the conflicts remain muddled and peripheral. Addy attacks his role with verve, energy, and Irish charm; but his character is never fully developed.In the prologue we were introduced to Benno Furmann as the Sin Eater, the &quot;Other&quot;. This plot twist is clever. The Sin Eater is a renegade entity that can offer, for a price, last moment absolution and forgiveness, a guaranteed path to paradise, outside of the Church's jurisdiction. The metaphysical task of devouring sins seems to create immortality. Benno, as William Eden, had existed for more than 500 years, and now it was time for him to pass on the mantle. Alex Bernier had been chosen as his successor from infancy. Every person, every circumstance in Alex's life was placed in his path by Eden. Benno's piercing calmness and intellect belie his dark powers. Was he good or evil, or trapped between them ? Is what he performed a service, a farce, or a sacrifice ?There is a manic subplot regarding a murderous religious coven that operated in the catacombs. They murdered priests, and they infleunced papal politics. Our discovery that the natty Cardinal Driscoll, a candidate for Pope, was the grand wizer of this band of zealous thugs, was yet another loose thread in the fabric of the patchwork plot. But Weller, too, had to accept the responsibility of his actions. When he was betrayed, exiled, disgraced, excommunicated, and facing death, he summoned Bernier. Alex, who had accepted his role as the latest &quot;Other&quot;, came to him. There was a Marat Sade suicide scene, and we witnessed the Sin Eater refusing to accommodate the Cardinal; thus damning him, and forcing him to embrace the demons waiting for him in the darkness.I was left, in the final flickers of this film, angry at the behemoth bureacracy that appeared to be the Catholic Church ( a symbol of all the secret societies and mammoth corporations that wield the power of this world ), and a vague sensation that I had experienced a unique vision of man's journey.",3,A Dream of Demons,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,5138,"['film', 'been', 'thoroughly', 'trashed',

783289,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0000TPA0G,Haunted Flower,"[0, 0]","1 Blu-ray Disc, released September 114, 2010""The Order"" originally came out in 2003 and was written and directed by Brian Helgeland and starred Heath Ledger as renegade priest, Father Alex Bernier on a search for answers after the head of his order dies mysteriously. He is aided by friend, Father Thomas Garrett played by Mark Addy and occasionally by fobidden by the church love interest, Mara Sinclair played by Shannyn Sossamon. His answers come in the form of William Eden played by Benno F&uuml;rmann.Eden reveals a secret order that produces a way to truly absolve sinners before death, even if they have been ex-communicated by the church. It is an almost supernatural occurance, the power of which gives the ""sin-eater"" immortality. So what does Eden want with Alex?I won't spoil it any further except for the classic what it means to be a man vs what it means to be a priest, especially if you are attracted to a certain girl. Heath Ledger's performance is impressive as the abstaining priest with all the Latin he has to perform in ceremonies and conversation. The story line's sudden change to being about the girl instead of the loss of his mentor is a little jarring. The strangest scene in the entire movie is the uber-emotional one where this polished priest who has been speaking all this Latin suddenly dissolves into cries of ""baby, no baby, no!"" as if he was instead schooled by years of gushy classic rock. It kills the moment entirely by how unnatural it sounds from this character!The character of Mara is a little crazy and carries a lot of mystery as to what her deal is which never feels resolved. Thomas Garrett is supposed to be this light spirit encouraging the buzz-killing Alex to laugh more and instantly turning on him when Alex feels inclined to act on that directive. The most interesting character by far is Benno F&uuml;rmann's performance as Eden like an angel walking on Earth taking on the sins of others. He always seems to be teetering on the edge of the pain of immortality balanced with being completely at peace with what he does.The film is an interesting premise with some really neat special effects, but I never bought the romantic relationship. The role of sin-eater in the movie is much more interesting and prevalent to the overall story. The story is told surprisingly against the back beat of a cyber-techno action vibe for a story about the Church.Bonus Features:The bonus features have 7 deleted scenes where Father Dominic visits some nuns who say nothing to him, Alex Berner demonstrates a normal last rites ceremony on a little boy, etc. There are also dailies of Heath Ledger's most emotional scene with a lot of sad grunting on his part but without the special effects. Lastly there is audio commentary by director Brian Helgeland who likes to comment on line deliveries he enjoys and inspirations for certain shots and how characters are posed and how difficulties of getting approved for a higher budget worked out in his favor with some long shots. Another interesting tidbit was that there was an armed robbery in pre-production with $90,000 worth of equipment stolen!",3,"The Order is ok, but not amazing in appearance or story",1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,3133,"['1', 'Blu-ray', 'Disc', 'released', 'September', '114', '2010', 'Order', 'originally', 'came', 'out', '2003', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'starred', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'renegade', 'priest', 'Father', 'Alex', 'Bernier', 'search', 'answers', 'head', 'order', 'mysteriously', 'aided', 'friend', 'Father', 'Thomas', 'Garrett', 'played', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'occasionally', 'fobidden', 'church', 'love', 'interest', 'Mara', 'Sinclair', 'played', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'answers', 'come', 'form', 'William', 'Eden', 'played', 'Benno', 'F', 'uuml', 'rmann.Eden', 'reveals', 'secret', 'order', 'way', 'truly', 'absolve', 'sinners', 'death', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'ex-communicated', 'church', 'almost', 'supernatural', 'occurance', 'power', 'sin-eater', 'immortality', 'So', 'what', 'Eden', 'want', 'Alex', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'further', 'classic', 'what', 'be', 'man', 'what', 'be', 'priest', 'especially', 'are', 'attracted', 'certain', 'girl', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'impressive', 'abstaining', 'priest', 'Latin', 'perform', 'ceremonies', 'conversation', 'story', 'line', 'sudden', 'change', 'being', 'girl', 'instead', 'loss', 'mentor', 'little', 'jarring', 'strangest', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'uber-emotional', 'one', 'where', 'polished', 'priest', 'who', 'been', 'speaking', 'Latin', 'suddenly', 'cries', 'baby', 'baby', 'was', 'instead', 'schooled', 'years', 'gushy', 'classic', 'rock', 'moment', 'entirely', 'how', 'unnatural', 'character', 'character', 'Mara', 'little', 'crazy', 'lot', 'mystery', 'what', 'deal', 'never', 'resolved', 'Thomas', 'Garrett', 'supposed', 'be', 'light', 'spirit', 'encouraging', 'buzz-killing', 'Alex', 'laugh', 'more', 'instantly', 'turning', 'when', 'Alex', 'feels', 'inclined', 'act', 'directive', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'far', 'Benno', 'F', 'uuml', 'rmann', 'performance', 'Eden', 'angel', 'walking', 'Earth', 'taking', 'sins', 'others', 'always', 'be', 'teetering', 'edge', 'pain', 'immortality', 'balanced', 'being', 'completely', 'peace', 'what', 'film', 'interesting', 'premise', 'really', 'neat', 'special', 'effects', 'never', 'bought', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'role', 'sin-eater', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'prevalent', 'overall', 'story', 'story', 'told', 'surprisingly', 'back', 'beat', 'cyber-techno', 'action', 'vibe', 'story', 'Church.Bonus', 'Features', 'bonus', 'features', 'have', '7', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'where', 'Father', 'Dominic', 'nuns', 'who', 'say', 'nothing', 'Alex', 'Berner', 'normal', 'last', 'rites', 'ceremony', 'little', 'boy', 'etc', 'are', 'also', 'dailies', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'most', 'emotional', 'scene', 'lot', 'sad', 'grunting', 'part', 'special', 'effects', 'Lastly', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'who', 'comment', 'line', 'deliveries', 'inspirations', 'certain', 'shots', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'posed', 'how', 'difficulties', 'getting', 'approved', 'higher', 'budget', 'worked', 'out', 'favor', 'long', 'shots', 'interesting', 'tidbit', 'was', 'was', 'armed', 'robbery', 'pre-production', '90,000', 'worth', 'equipment', 'stolen']",The Order

He chooses not to tell the authorities.The church arranges a flight for Alex to Rome. He takes Mara with him. Their he comes across the two strange orphans (Mirko Casaburo, Giulia Lombardi) that sit still in the parlor.  He examines the body of Dominic and finds unusual markings on his chest.

It flits from topic to topic without ever giving insight as to what's really going on. Even the &quot;plot twist&quot; at the end was a wasted effort as I never had a clue what was going on to begin with.

Oh and there's some mumbo jumbo about the ""sin-eater"" (movie was originally going to be titled ""sin-eater"").

The basic plot of the story is great, but it gets sidetracked with a lot of stuff. It reminds me of The Devil's Advocate a little bit, but it is a much less entertaining film.

A priest bikes through Rome and arrives at his home, a dilapidated structure haunted by zombie-like children who look more like they should be in the pages of a Gap Kids photo shoot than haunting the outskirts of a major metropolis. The priest and the children gaze meaningfully at each other, and then the priest goes inside. There, he's greeted by a suave younger man in a nice suit. There is danger in the air.Unfortunately, the movie never gets any better. Although Heath Ledger pulls off the tragically hip, he's completely unbelievable as a young Catholic priest. Shannyn Sossamon plays a completely vapid love interest. There's a back-story there, but it's shallow and ill conceived.Everyone in the movie, outside of Ledger and Sossaman and their sidekick, appear to be corrupt, but in a VH1 goes to Europe sort of way. Where does one find a renegade cult figure? Why, in an underground Catholic themed disco, of course. Just follow the Sinead O'Connor look-alike through the catacombs.That, to me, is the central problem with this film. It tries far too hard to look edgy and cool, and completely loses track of the story. The typical pseudo-philosophy dished out in the mental struggle between our hero and his antagonist is so ham-handed and dull as to be completely laughable.The cinematography is gorgeous and the idea behind the plot is nifty.

This immortal individual performs an arcane ritual which can secure salvation for those outside the grace of the Roman Catholic Church. The current ""Sin Eater"" is weary of this burden and wants to recruit himself a replacement in Father Alex (Heath Ledger).Besides the slow pace and lack of focus, the movie's greatest flaw is the complete absence of any chemistry between the two stars.

783297,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000TPA0G,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 16]","&quot;The Order&quot; is a rather boring movie that fails early one to get the audience involved in a convoluted religious story.  I starting watching this 2003 film thinking it was some sort of attempt to do a film of a  Dan Brown novel without using a Dan Brown novel (like &quot;Jezebel&quot; beating &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; to the big screen) because all I knew was that it was about a priest, Alex Bernier (Heath Ledger) trying to solve a murder with all sorts of connections to the Catholic Church.  Then I noticed Mark Addy was in the film playing Thomas Garrett, another member of Alex's order, the Carolingians (an order that supposedly makes the Jesuits look like drop outs), and remembered they were in &quot;A Knight's Tale&quot; together.  Then I looked at the female lead in the film, Shannyn Sossamon as Mara Sinclair and thought that she looked a lot like the girl in &quot;A Knight's Tale.&quot;  Of course, she is, and the writer-director of &quot;The Order&quot; is Brian Helgeland, the writer-director of &quot;A Knight's Tale.&quot;  So now I am watching this film and wondering how these four people got together to make a film that could not have less in common with their previous collaboration.Maybe &quot;The Order&quot; would work better with a different cast because that fact keeps getting in the way.  But by the time I had put those connections together I was already rather disinterested in the story.  The head of the Carolingians is killed by a Sin Eater (Benno F&uuml;rmann), which has all sorts of religious and historical significance.  Alex goes after the Sin Eater, intending to kill him, only to find the tables turned on him in a rather interesting way, but for a lot of viewers I bet it will be too late.  In other words, if this movie was on television, a lot of viewers would have changed channels before it got to the part where the twist is revealed.  But when you pay to watch something you tend to stick it out to the end (which explains why I watched it all and my wife went to bed).The story of the Sin Eater's origin is probably the most interesting scene in the film, but when the best scene in the film is a flashback, that is not a good thing.  If Brian Helgeland has ditched the Mara character, so that the audience was not expecting her and Alex to end up in bed together, despite the collar he is usually wearing, this film might have worked better.  There is a tendency to want to compare this film with &quot;The Exorcist,&quot; but actually it reminded me more of &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (think about it, I am not off the wall here).  I was almost going to add another star to this one until the Alex-Mara sub-plot picked up steam again and effectively derailed the last half of the film.  Picking up the pacing for the first half hour would have helped as well.There is a good idea here buried beneath all of the interpersonal angst of Alex's character, but in the end &quot;The Order&quot; simply does not work and the fault lies with Helgeland's writing half.  Of course, given that he did the superb adaptations of &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and &quot;Mystic River,&quot; this is rather surprising conclusion to reach.  The DVD includes a series of deleted scenes that make it clear this movie could have moved even slower and been even less interesting, and in the end &quot;The Order&quot; is one of those films where the trailer is a lot more interesting than the actual film, which is one of the greatest sins in the cinema today.",3,A boring film that fails to capture our interest soon enough,1075248000,"01 28, 2004",2004,3526,"['quot', 'Order', 'quot', 'rather', 'boring', 'movie', 'early', 'one', 'get', 'audience', 'involved', 'convoluted', 'religious', 'story', 'starting', 'watching', '2003', 'film', 'thinking', 'was', 'sort', 'attempt', 'do', 'film', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'novel', 'using', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'novel', 'quot', 'Jezebel', 'quot', 'beating', 'quot', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'quot', 'big', 'screen', 'knew', 'was', 'was', 'priest', 'Alex', 'Bernier', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'trying', 'solve', 'murder', 'sorts', 'connections', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Then', 'noticed', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'was', 'film', 'playing', 'Thomas', 'Garrett', 'member', 'Alex', 'order', 'Carolingians', 'order', 'supposedly', 'Jesuits', 'look', 'drop', 'outs', 'remembered', 'were', 'quot', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'quot', 'together', 'Then', 'looked', 'female', 'lead', 'film', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'Mara', 'Sinclair', 'thought', 'looked', 'lot', 'girl', 'quot', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale.', 'quot', 'course', 'writer-director', 'quot', 'Order', 'quot', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'writer-director', 'quot', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale.', 'quot', 'now', 'am', 'watching', 'film', 'wondering', 'how', 'four', 'people', 'got', 'together', 'make', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'less', 'common', 'previous', 'collaboration.Maybe', 'quot', 'Order', 'quot', 'would', 'work', 'better', 'different', 'cast', 'fact', 'getting', 'way', 'time', 'had', 'put', 'connections', 'together', 'was', 'already', 'rather', 'disinterested', 'story', 'head', 'Carolingians', 'killed', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'Benno', 'F', 'uuml', 'rmann', 'sorts', 'religious', 'historical', 'significance', 'Alex', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'intending', 'kill', 'only', 'find', 'tables', 'turned', 'rather', 'interesting', 'way', 'lot', 'viewers', 'bet', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'other', 'words', 'movie', 'was', 'television', 'lot', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'channels', 'got', 'part', 'where', 'twist', 'revealed', 'when', 'pay', 'watch', 'something', 'tend', 'stick', 'out', 'end', 'why', 'watched', 'wife', 'went', 'bed', 'story', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'origin', 'probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'flashback', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'ditched', 'Mara', 'character', 'audience', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'Alex', 'end', 'up', 'bed', 'together', 'collar', 'usually', 'wearing', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'tendency', 'want', 'compare', 'film', 'quot', 'Exorcist', 'quot', 'actually', 'reminded', 'more', 'quot', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'quot', 'think', 'am', 'not', 'wall', 'here', 'was', 'almost', 'going', 'add', 'star', 'one', 'Alex-Mara', 'sub-plot', 'picked', 'up', 'steam', 'again', 'effectively', 'derailed', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'Picking', 'up', 'pacing', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'well.There', 'good', 'idea', 'here', 'buried', 'interpersonal', 'angst', 'Alex', 'character', 'end', 'quot', 'Order', 'quot', 'simply', 'not', 'work', 'fault', 'Helgeland', 'writing', 'half', 'course', 'given', 'did', 'superb', 'adaptations', 'quot', 'L.A.', 'Confidential', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'rather', 'surprising', 'conclusion', 'reach', 'DVD', 'series', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'make', 'clear', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'moved', 'even', 'slower', 'been', 'even', 'less', 'interesting', 'end', 'quot', 'Order', 'quot', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'trailer', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'actual', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'sins', 'cinema', 'today']",The Order

This is a real horror film, with a completely original plot, a well-written screenplay with thought-provoking dialouge, and lots of unexpected twists.The story is about Alex Bernier (Heath Ledger), a young Carolinian priest schooled in the supernatural by his mentor, Dominic.  When Dominic is found dead, the Church rules it a suicide.  Alex and his friend (Mark Addy) suspect a Sin Eater is on the loose.  A disturbed young woman named Mara who is in love with Alex assists them as they journey to Rome.  Alex encounters the Sin Eater, and he is not what you would expect.  How will Alex prevent himself from being sucked in to a plan he does not even understand?Don't expect a happy ending here - this is horror through and through.  The story has plenty of controversial and disturbing elements, such as a cussing priest, a priest giving into his desires for the flesh, and even a Dark Pope.The only downside was Mark Addy's acting.  This star of The Full Monty and the CBS sitcom Still Standing switched back and forth between an American and a (bad) Irish accent.

For example, I thought ""The Game"" with Michael Douglas was one of the best of this type of movie. I thought this movie had the potential of being in the same class as ""The Game,"" but I was disappointed.Part of the problem is the story itself. Alex Bernier (Heath Ledger) is a young priest investigating the apparent suicide of his mentor. It is important to the story to realize that all the principal characters are Catholic. While suicide is a sin in all religions, in the Catholic faith it is perhaps the worst sin of all because it can never be forgiven and prevents that person from being buried in hallowed ground. Alex struggles to believe that his mentor could have committed suicide and sets out to understand why or to prove that he did not commit suicide.The movie plods along, paced by Alex's thoughts and his interaction with William Eden (Benno F&uuml;rmann) and Mara Sinclair (Shannyn Sossamon), along with several other characters, including Peter Weller in one his most unusual roles. The problem with the pacing is that the core issues in this movie are the shock of ""sin eating,"" a pagan practice that dates back hundreds of years, and corruption with the church. Perhaps Catholics might be shocked that sin eating might still exist, but Protestants are going to yawn and say ""so what?"" Further, with the significant on-going publicity regarding a variety of crimes committed by various priests and the ensuing cover up by the Catholic Church, political corruption within the Church and the possibility that some of the most important members of the church might be other than they seem just isn't all that shocking. This movie should have been made twenty years ago when it might have had more of an effect.The actors here are not at fault. The acting throughout is quite good. I was very impressed by all the principal characters, especially by Heath Ledger, who did an excellent job. Shannyn Sossaman as his conflicted love interest was dark, brooding, very sensual and sexual and yet also very innocent; outstanding acting. The cinematography was similarly excellent and enhanced the subject quite well. The problem with the movie is that the central conflict will have little effect on many people, and thus they will lose interest and not want to spend the effort to focus on the complex, philosophical story line.Perhaps Brian Helgeland could have made this movie a different way or with a different script and achieved the effect he was hoping to create. Instead the movie spends far too much time on religious philosophy and on the shock of salvation by means other than religious beliefs, and many members of the audience will have a difficult time to relate.",3,Religious Thriller?,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,2770,"['enjoy', 'intelligent', 'thrillers', 'even', 'move', 'forward', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'example', 'thought', 'Game', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'type', 'movie', 'thought', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'being', 'same', 'class', 'Game', 'was', 'disappointed.Part', 'problem', 'story', 'Alex', 'Bernier', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'young', 'priest', 'investigating', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'mentor', 'important', 'story', 'realize', 'principal', 'characters', 'are', 'Catholic', 'suicide', 'sin', 'religions', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'sin', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'forgiven', 'prevents', 'person', 'being', 'buried', 'hallowed', 'ground', 'Alex', 'believe', 'mentor', 'could', 'have', 'committed', 'suicide', 'out', 'understand', 'why', 'prove', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'suicide.The', 'movie', 'plods', 'along', 'paced', 'Alex', 'thoughts', 'interaction', 'William', 'Eden', 'Benno', 'F', 'uuml', 'Mara', 'Sinclair', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'roles', 'problem', 'pacing', 'core', 'issues', 'movie', 'are', 'shock', 'sin', 'eating', 'pagan', 'practice', 'back', 'hundreds', 'years', 'corruption', 'church', 'Perhaps', 'Catholics', 'might', 'be', 'shocked', 'sin', 'eating', 'might', 'still', 'exist', 'Protestants', 'are', 'going', 'yawn', 'say', 'so', 'what', 'Further', 'significant', 'on-going', 'publicity', 'regarding', 'variety', 'crimes', 'committed', 'various', 'priests', 'ensuing', 'cover', 'up', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'political', 'corruption', 'Church', 'possibility', 'most', 'important', 'members', 'church', 'might', 'be', 'other', 'seem', 'just', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'effect.The', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'fault', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'principal', 'characters', 'especially', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'who', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Shannyn', 'Sossaman', 'conflicted', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'dark', 'brooding', 'very', 'sensual', 'sexual', 'yet', 'also', 'very', 'innocent', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'was', 'similarly', 'excellent', 'enhanced', 'subject', 'quite', 'well', 'problem', 'movie', 'central', 'conflict', 'will', 'have', 'little', 'effect', 'many', 'people', 'thus', 'will', 'lose', 'interest', 'not', 'want', 'spend', 'effort', 'focus', 'complex', 'philosophical', 'story', 'line.Perhaps', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'different', 'way', 'different', 'script', 'achieved', 'effect', 'was', 'hoping', 'create', 'Instead', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'religious', 'philosophy', 'shock', 'salvation', 'other', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'many', 'members', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'relate']",The Order
783300,A17NVM7IAPF2NS,B0000TPA0G,Maek,"[4, 8]","I did not see this movie in the theater, but was curious to see it after seeing some brief advertisement for it on TV.  My wife and I bought the DVD.I have to admit that the film started with surprising promise.  A priest has a run-in with a man, whom we later find out to be a &quot;Sin Eater&quot;, which leads to his mysterious demise.  Is it suicide?  Murder?  Is it possible that some evil force was involved?  As we get introduced to the cast, we come across 3 demons; one with a message portending an evil Pope on the rise and the other 2 as the laughably quotable &quot;demon spawn in the guise of children.&quot;  Who the hell says &quot;guise&quot; of whatever these days?However, what I thought would turn out to be some edgy thriller with demons galore turned out to be a snooze-fest with Heath Ledger playing a priest who barely has enough time to establish that he wants to maintain his faith (as eventually contested by the Sin Eater) before he jumps out of his clothes and sleeps with a woman he helped once through a difficult time.  The Sin Eater/Ledger scenes start out to be interesting, but after hearing the same message paraphrased about 3 times in various scenes (church, private jet, etc.), my wife wondered aloud, &quot;I hope this picks up some time soon.&quot;  Unfortunately, it does not and the movie becomes surprisingly confused and wonders off to a different place.Ledger's scenes with the Sin Eater seem surreal and at times I have dim recollections of other characters in the film.  The other priest and the girl are conveniently written out at key times in the film and the feeling is contrived and forced.What is even worse (or perhaps funny, you choose) is that demon-fighting apparently involves a priest holding up a cross and informing it that it should go back to hell.  Please.  Yes, go back to hell and begone with you.  Whoosh!  They're gone.  You think that evil would just be a little more powerful beyond conjuring a 10,000 horse-power leaf blower to knock Ledger down in the graveyard.  Oooooo...he fell down...what next?  Ok, granted, I'll give you that the nailing of Thomas (the other priest) was somewhat suspenseful, but you think that demons over several millenia would learn to aim with somewhat more deadly accuracy.What hurts the movie even more was to have scenes which bring questions as to who/why/what/when/where at the very beginning and taking an EXCRUCIATING amount of time explaining them.  And when the explanations come, they are short, abrupt, and rather unsatisfying given the amount of time that was left to build them up.The &quot;plot twist&quot; at the end amounted to an extremely dessicated lemon that one could see a hundred miles away.  When it came, I stared at my ceiling in despair and wondered if there was any more to come of it.It's a pity that this movie turned out this way because some clever re-writing and editing could have made this much better.  Always beware when you have the same person write, direct, and produce your movie.  That's too much work on one person's shoulders and it's painfully obvious here.The movie's saving grace is that it is fairly well-acted throughout.  That and the first half hour of the film had me rooted to the spot.  I think the movie, however, decided to lose me when Ledger's character decided to show his true colors and reveal how weak he truly is.  I mean, it did not even feel like he put up much of a fight.  &quot;No, I can not...ok, Sin Eater, I see your point.  I'll roll over, sit, speak, and do whatever you want me to do.&quot;",2,Could have been MUCH better...,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3563,"['did', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'seeing', 'brief', 'advertisement', 'TV', 'wife', 'bought', 'DVD.I', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'started', 'surprising', 'promise', 'priest', 'run-in', 'man', 'whom', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'be', 'quot', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'quot', 'mysterious', 'demise', 'suicide', 'Murder', 'possible', 'evil', 'force', 'was', 'involved', 'get', 'introduced', 'cast', 'come', '3', 'demons', 'one', 'message', 'portending', 'evil', 'Pope', 'rise', 'other', '2', 'laughably', 'quotable', 'quot', 'demon', 'spawn', 'guise', 'children.', 'quot', 'Who', 'hell', 'quot', 'guise', 'quot', 'days', 'However', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'edgy', 'thriller', 'demons', 'galore', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'snooze-fest', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'playing', 'priest', 'who', 'barely', 'enough', 'time', 'establish', 'maintain', 'faith', 'eventually', 'contested', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'clothes', 'sleeps', 'woman', 'helped', 'once', 'difficult', 'time', 'Sin', 'Eater/Ledger', 'scenes', 'start', 'out', 'be', 'interesting', 'hearing', 'same', 'message', 'paraphrased', 'about', '3', 'times', 'various', 'scenes', 'church', 'private', 'jet', 'etc', 'wife', 'wondered', 'aloud', 'quot', 'hope', 'up', 'time', 'soon.', 'quot', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'confused', 'wonders', 'different', 'place.Ledger', 'scenes', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'seem', 'surreal', 'times', 'have', 'dim', 'recollections', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'other', 'priest', 'girl', 'are', 'conveniently', 'written', 'out', 'key', 'times', 'film', 'feeling', 'contrived', 'forced.What', 'even', 'worse', 'perhaps', 'funny', 'choose', 'demon-fighting', 'apparently', 'priest', 'holding', 'up', 'cross', 'informing', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'hell', 'Please', 'Yes', 'go', 'back', 'hell', 'begone', 'Whoosh', ""'re"", 'gone', 'think', 'evil', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'powerful', 'conjuring', '10,000', 'horse-power', 'leaf', 'blower', 'knock', 'Ledger', 'down', 'graveyard', 'fell', 'down', 'what', 'Ok', 'granted', ""'ll"", 'give', 'nailing', 'Thomas', 'other', 'priest', 'was', 'somewhat', 'suspenseful', 'think', 'demons', 'several', 'millenia', 'would', 'learn', 'aim', 'somewhat', 'more', 'deadly', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'have', 'scenes', 'bring', 'questions', 'who/why/what/when/where', 'very', 'beginning', 'taking', 'EXCRUCIATING', 'amount', 'time', 'explaining', 'when', 'explanations', 'come', 'are', 'short', 'abrupt', 'rather', 'unsatisfying', 'given', 'amount', 'time', 'was', 'left', 'build', 'up.The', 'quot', 'twist', 'quot', 'end', 'amounted', 'extremely', 'dessicated', 'lemon', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'hundred', 'miles', 'away', 'When', 'came', 'stared', 'ceiling', 'despair', 'wondered', 'was', 'more', 'come', 'it.It', 'pity', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'clever', 're-writing', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'Always', 'beware', 'when', 'have', 'same', 'person', 'write', 'direct', 'produce', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'one', 'person', 'shoulders', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'here.The', 'movie', 'saving', 'grace', 'fairly', 'well-acted', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'had', 'rooted', 'spot', 'think', 'movie', 'however', 'decided', 'lose', 'when', 'Ledger', 'character', 'decided', 'show', 'true', 'colors', 'reveal', 'how', 'weak', 'truly', 'mean', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'feel', 'put', 'up', 'much', 'fight', 'quot', 'No', 'can', 'not', 'ok', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'see', 'point', ""'ll"", 'roll', 'over', 'sit', 'speak', 'do', 'want', 'do.', 'quot']",The Order

Volmar,"[51, 59]","Alex (Heath Ledger) a rebellious priest from a disappearing fringe of Catholicism goes to Rome to determine the cause of the mysterious death of Dominic, his excommunicated mentor. He is accompanied in his quest by Mara (Shannyn Sossamon), a troubled love who just escaped an institution for the mentally ill and by Thomas (Mark Addy), the other living priest of his church. Together and with the help of a Cardinal (Peter Weller) and a murky and devious character named Chirac, he discovers that a Sin Eater, a person capable of absorbing someone else's sins thus granting them entry to the kingdom of Heaven over God's back, was behind the death of Dominic. When the church refuses Dominic a burial in holy ground, Alex, who is supposed to kill the Sin Eater under the Cardinal's suggestion, is instead lured by him to find the truth and understand the meaning of what he does. Then the conflict between Alex's beliefs and desires begins.This movie has a well-assembled cast (some returning actors from Brian Helgeland's previous movie A Knight's Tale) and great acting throughout, specially from Ledger and Weller. It has a tight-written, coherent script with wonderful character interactions, great moody music and very-well placed and never overdone special effects. The best thing this movie offers though, is a subconscious lingering question about the darkness that surrounds us, be it as sin, demons, or other supernatural beings. In this regard this movie is more suspenseful and scarier than the best of horror movies.Watch it, pay attention and enjoy.--Reviewed by M. E.

Heath Ledger plays Father Alex Bernier one of the last surviving members of a sect, the Carolingians (?), that perform exorcisms, drive demons back to Hell and generally cavort with the fringe dwellers of the Catholic religion. The C's believe in the sanctity of the Old Testament and are, to put it mildly, barely tolerated by Rome. This business of the C's and their place in the priesthood and in Rome is the most interesting part of the film, though Bernier pulling out a large Crucifix and driving demons enclosed in the bodies of two innocent children playing jacks back to Hell,is pretty cool also.There is also a character named William Eden (Benno Furmann) who is a ""Sin Eater"" (this guy literally ingests, thereby expiates the sinner of his sins...very neat!) who according to Rome, has been dead for 500 years but who seems very much alive. In fact he  makes a large amount of money authenticating old works of art. How/Why? Because he was an eyewitness to Michelangelo and Caravaggio actually creating their art. Plus the man has impeccable taste as evidenced by his penchant for French White Burgundies. The man knows his Vino. Furmann plays the heck out of this role, by the way: bulging his eyes, licking his lips, managing to have the strangest look on his face at all times and generally having a gay old time with it. My main concern here is why does he sound like Jeff Spicoli part of the time and Count Dracula the other?As I was leaving the theater, a teenager says to his friend: ""I didn't know this film was about religion.""

Ledger and Sossamyn have the looks to be stars; Addy has the buddy support syndrome down pretty pat.Now, what this film is about ultimately is a person called a &quot;Sin Eater.&quot;  This mysterious figure eats the sins of those who have been ostracized or condemned by the church, but one never knows whether this is a good or bad character.  Helgeland's script also numbs this.  The inclusion of the little boy and girl demons is never explained; there are some really dull sequences and the strange bar in the Vatican wholly incredible.Peter Weller's bald cardinal wants to be Pope is also poorly written and mediocrally performed.Ledger has one very effective scene that occurs with the apparent suicide of his love.  It's the strongest acting moment in the film.Sossamyn is beautiful for sure, and plays her strange part rather well (why did she try to kill Ledger?  It's never fully explained).Addy and Ledger's chemistry is not as effective as it was in Knight's Tale.In this time of troubles for the Catholic Church, a film like THE ORDER will certainly not benefit their credence in the religious community.

783307,A3SU3TXON36T0X,B0000TPA0G,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[3, 11]","_The Order_ is an excellent thriller movie which deals with certain folk practices surrounding the Roman Catholic Church as well as some of the secret influence behind the Vatican.  In this movie, ""the Order"" refers to a secret (entirely fictional) Catholic order called the Carolingians which is supposed to have ""surpassed even the Jesuits"" in its quest for knowledge and its flirtation with heresy.  Of course, the Jesuit order is well known for producing many exorcists and psychologists as well as for flirting with heresy (routinely being accused of Protestantism and/or unorthodox belief, as well as tampering with earthly governments and kingly courts, and previously suppressed in its history by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, although later reestablished, and today often accused of modernism, liberalism, or worse).  However, the idea that the Jesuits constitute a sort of secret society on the same level as the freemasons for example is simply incorrect.  While the Jesuit order founded by Saint Ignatius of Loyola maintains a code of strict obedience to a superior (argued by critics to involve obedience even unto commission of sin, though in reality never demanding that one sin) and ultimately to the head of the order (sometimes referred to facetiously as ""the black pope"", based on his black robes - not to be confused with the ""dark pope"", a pagan imposter, vying for the real papacy who appears in the movie as a fictional character), the Jesuits do not demand the kind of secret oaths which masonry demands calling for disembowelment, dismemberment, and the removal of the tongue should one reveal the secrets of the ""brethren"".  Thus, in this sense the movie relies on certain antiCatholic hysteria in propagating its understanding of the secret order the Carolingians (which in fact does not exist) though supposedly based upon the Jesuits.  The movie focusses on a certain character known as the ""sin eater"" who is supposedly immortal, till a special rite is performed releasing him from his position and creating a new sin eater.  According to the movie, the sin eater operates outside the church which maintains a strict interpretation of ""Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus"" (""outside the church there is no salvation"") as a sort of secondary way to enter the Kingdom of God (i.e. heaven) at one's death.  The movie suggests that the notion of the sin eater was created when Christ through a special grace gave forgiveness to the ""good thief"" on the Cross thus allowing him to enter heaven, even though he had not belonged to the Church proper.  In reality, there were men called sin eaters living in the Middle Ages (particularly in England) operating outside the church as a sort of folklore among the populace and ""eating a man's sins"" by taking a piece of bread off the body of a dying man.  Perhaps, the practice of sin eating originated in towns where the plague was particularly violent and access to priests was difficult, or in countries which had been placed under interdict thus not allowing access to the sacraments.  The sin eater was often a very rich man taking as a sort of death tax the most precious object he could find in the dying man's house, and upon ""eating the sins"" of the dying man would take them upon himself, thus releasing the man from sin and allowing him to enter the Kingdom of God.  However, according to folklore the sin eater was not immortal (as the movie suggests).  Rather, at death, the sin eater himself would try to find another sin eater (often his eldest sin) to eat his sins, thus furthering the chain.  Otherwise, the sin eater would be damned.  (Oddly, one wonders how this would continue through generations as each subsequent sin eater would be quite full of the sins of the last, till eventual overflow.)  According to the movie, the sin eater works for a secret society, run by the ""dark pope"" - a sort of mysterious pagan imposter (satanic involute of the true pope) vying for the papal chair.  While secret societies and papal poisonings have always surrounded the Vatican hierarchy, particularly in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period, when power was consolidated within certain elite families, but perhaps also as late as Pope John Paul I, who died in a rather mysterious fashion which some have suggested may have involved foul play, these serpents should not be confused with the church proper.  In fact, for example, the church has always condemned freemasonry (though often infiltrated by its members at high levels) which is such a secret initiatic society.  The movie also makes reference to the poetry of English Romantic John Keats including his ""Ode to a Grecian Urn"" (""beauty is truth, truth beauty"") and ""Ode to a Nightingale"" (which plays a part in the &quot;illness&quot;/possession of the female character Mara).  Despite its many errors in fact and its obvious antiCatholic slant, the movie does provide a good thriller movie which will prove entertaining to all who watch it.  Featuring a rogue priest who is initiated when he performs a burial outside the church's proper jurisdiction, the movie examines the conflicts of a priest burdened with esoteric knowledge.  If you have enjoyed books such as _Foucault's Pendulum_ by Umberto Eco or conspiracy type thrillers in general with occult ideas, this movie will interest you, particularly if you like to take a look at the darker side of human life.",5,A NeoGnostic Vatican Conspiracy/Occult Thriller.,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,5395,"['_The', 'Order_', 'excellent', 'thriller', 'movie', 'certain', 'folk',

With the director and two stars from ""A Knight's Tale"" (which I loved), why did they re-team for this waste of film. The previews made it look interesting and the premise was intriguing, but the delivery was a major disappointment. It's not quite horror, not quite suspenseful, not spiritual, but just a dark stab at something.While I like Heath Ledger and especially Shannyn Sossamon, I don't know what they were thinking when they decided to make this film. Maybe they wanted to reunite with the director again, but if that's the case, they were better off doing a sequel to the far superior ""A Knight's Tale"". This film focuses on a priest called in to investigate the death of his mentor. Turns out, there's a person called a ""sin eater"" who absolves people of their sins just before death. However, the price for such a ""gift"" is that the sin eater lives eternally (think of a Catholic version of the vampire). Such is a heavy burden to bear, as the sin eater gains all knowledge of the person's sins. The film is pretty much dark in tone, dealing with such things as suicide, death, secret underground societies in which people are hung by their necks. Blah! Nothing about this film gives you a good feeling or any kind of inspiration to take with you. It's the kind of film that makes people leaving theaters feeling awful...certainly not a way to box office success. Because it bombed at the box office, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone why. While there is a place for dark movies, this one is simply too dark for my tastes. The only thing I like about the film besides the scenes of Rome is the presence of Shannyn Sossamon.

It's advertised as a horror movie about an order within the Catholic Church that investigates the paranormal. So, of course, when I finally did buy this movie in 2005, that's what I was expecting, and what I wanted. But what this movie actually is is something completely different. I didn't like it much the first time around, and I felt cheated. But then it stayed with me and I eventually watched it again, with an open mind, and again and again. Now it's one of my favorite movies.I will not lie - in many places the movie feels like a failed attempt to be an intelligent thriller and a scary horror movie at the same time. It's not scary, not one bit, but it does feel like a thoughtful, intelligent, and atmospheric movie. It also requires the viewer to pay attention. It's the sort of film that upon repeat viewings you'll pick up on things you missed before, and you may just like it the more you see it.The cast, mostly transplanted from the director's previous ""A Knight's Tale"", is pretty good, and the only problems I saw were an occasional badly written line that they did their best with.

The head of an order of priests, Father Dominic (Francesco Carnelluti) is found dead in his apartment, leaving only two living priests in his sect, Alex (Heath Ledger, with whom Helgeland previously worked in A Knight's Tale) and Thomas (Mark Addy, who will forever be remembered as ""the fat guy"" from The Full Monty). The two of them, accompanied by a woman (Shannyn Sossamon) Alex has conflicting feelings about, travel to Rome on the orders of a high-ranking cardinal (Robocop's Peter Weller) to investigate Dominic's death, and along the way uncover a number of strange and wonderful things, including the last living Sin Eater, William Eden (Benno Furmann, who will be playing Siegfried in the upcoming film version of The Ring of the Nibelungs), who is in some way intimately connected with Dominic's death.It all sounds fabulous on paper. And, to an extent, it is. But various factors kill the movie. Both Weller and Furmann deliver their lines as if someone told them, ""sound as artificial as possible."" Weller might as well still have the metal suit on. And the odd pair of ""orphans"" who hang around outside Dominic's apartment; I'm sure that, in a director's cut, we'd have some concrete idea of why they hang around Dominic, but a hypothesis is offered, and then the plot thread disappears into the distance, never to be heard from again.One rather expects a level of ludicrousness from Ledger, Sossamon, and Helgeland, who between them were responsible for A Knight's Tale a few years back.

Not so much the odd demon that gets casually vanquished en route - ""What was that?"" ""Demonspawn in the guise of children. Nothing I can't handle."" - nor even Peter Weller's hardboiled no-bull Cardinal, the Vatican's answer to Philip Marlowe with a streak of Hitler thrown in for good measure. No, it's the masked villain hanging people from crosses underneath a Rome nightclub that really sets this one on the road to Hell in the worst way.By comparison, the Sin Eater himself comes as a welcome breath of fresh air, albeit short-lived before we're back to the wildly overplayed conspiracy. Ledger seems to be basing his performance on Arthur Pewty from Monty Python's Flying Circus, and at times I almost expected Graham Chapman to appear in officer's uniform to insist ""Stop it right now! This sketch has got far too silly!"" But that would be far too convincing for this film.

783322,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000TPA0G,Tsuyoshi,"[10, 15]","Three stars of Brian Helgeland-directed &quot;A Knight's Tale&quot; come back -- Heath Ledger, Mark Addy, and Shannyn Sossamon -- in this religious thriller.  I wanted to see again the lovely Ms. Sossamon (whose role is not big here), but what I saw turned out a (literally) painfully bad film that could have killed her career so easily.The alternate title of the film was &quot;The Sin Eater&quot; which would be more appropriate for the occasion.  Heath Ledger's character, Alex, investigates the mysterious death of the master of his order, and he comes to realise there is a man hiding behind -- Eden, or &quot;the Sin Eater&quot; played by German Benno Furmann (&quot;The Princess and the Warrior&quot;).  As Alex and his trusted friend Thomas (Mark Addy) delves the murky case, we know there is a conspiracy behind the thick curtain of the church.You see also Ms. Sossamon as Alex's love interest, and Peter Weller as one of the possible successor to the Pope.It is clear that director Helgeland researched several things about the Catholic church, to make the basis of the film.  However, everything is too slow and tedious to grab our attention -- the initial death of the mentor, which should be more grisly or shocking, happens behind the closed door so we are not scared nor interested in it at all.  Moreover, the film's script is not effective.  Though Shannyn Sossamon and Mark Addy in particlar have no substantial function in the film, they continue showing up over and over again, only to confuse everything.Worse is the bland acting, and all the actors are guilty of making the film insipid, especially Heath Ledger whose emotionally detached portrayal of Alex is too off-putting for us.  And the photography by Nicola Pecorini (famous for Dario Argento films) is also too dark when at night, which does not help, except inducing us to sleep (which I did).But the worst is the idea of using CGIs in this kind of occult films, in which delicately expressed character and carefully handled atmosphere play the vital part in creating the scares.  When special effects appear in this film, we know that this is money-enhanced effctes, and that idea on our side instantly kills the potentials of the film.

So many things not explained or reasons for. Dont waste the time or money on this. Any good reviews on this must be from people who dont get to the movies much because if you are a big movie goer there is no way you could have thought this to be a good movie.
