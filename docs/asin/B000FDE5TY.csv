988231,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B000FDE5TY,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this show. A bunch of extreme stunts done by six random people, does not sound like a good premise. But the result was actualy very interesting. The stunts look very tough but many of them would be fun to do, although many will bawk at doing any of the second stunts.The only negative aspect to mention is the fact that every episode has different cast members. I'm used to watching reality shows where the cast grows on you. This is a show that has Survivor/Amazing Race premise but behaves like Wheel of Fortune/Price is right. So it took me awhile to get used to that, as it seems the show wants us to bond with the cast but there's so little time to do so.Other then that, good show and I'm glad there's at least some of it lurking out there.",5,Pretty good show,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,784,"['was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'bunch', 'extreme', 'stunts', 'done', 'six', 'random', 'people', 'not', 'sound', 'good', 'premise', 'result', 'was', 'actualy', 'very', 'interesting', 'stunts', 'look', 'very', 'tough', 'many', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'do', 'many', 'will', 'bawk', 'doing', 'second', 'stunts.The', 'only', 'negative', 'aspect', 'mention', 'fact', 'episode', 'different', 'cast', 'members', ""'m"", 'used', 'watching', 'reality', 'where', 'cast', 'show', 'Survivor/Amazing', 'Race', 'premise', 'behaves', 'Wheel', 'Fortune/Price', 'right', 'took', 'awhile', 'get', 'used', 'show', 'bond', 'cast', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'do', 'so.Other', 'then', 'good', 'show', ""'m"", 'glad', 'least', 'lurking', 'out', 'there']",Fear Factor: The First Season
988232,AE6APIV5K93KF,B000FDE5TY,"Susan W. Sager ""fancyface""","[1, 2]","I really like ""Fear Factor"" and each and every show has something different and unique to add and new challenges to face and fears to over come. I always look foward to watching these shows on the television to see what stunts are going to come up with next and of course to see who is going to win the money.I have hope that some of the challenges I will be able to face and over come one day because life is too short not to live well, and being afraid of certain challenges in life is not good. Of course I would never do the extremely dangerous stunts... but I do have a fear of heights that I would like to face and over come.The only problem that I can see with these sets is that after you watch them one time, you don't really care to watch them again! I have got my moneys worth because the price is not bad at only $20 and I have let other people borrow my set and they have enjoyed it also. (Plus you can sell it back to Amazon or on Ebay if you get tired of it and make some money back, if you choose to.)I can see why these sets do not sell is much because many people don't enjoy this type of ""gross out"" show and plus it is not the type of show that you would watch over and over again. I hope that they continue to complete the rest of seasons on dvd, but also offer these sets at a really reasonable price so that we will get are money's worth for what we buy.All in all I recommend buying this set for anyone who loves ""Fear Factor"" and of course it always makes a good conversation starter for groups of people to watch and enjoy together. This season has a good variety of episodes from difficult phisical challenges to mental challenges of eating something gross. This is a very fun show to watch and get carried away with, but don't try these stunts at home :)",4,Fun Fun Fun...,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,1782,"['really', 'Fear', 'Factor', 'show', 'something', 'different', 'unique', 'add', 'new', 'challenges', 'face', 'fears', 'come', 'always', 'look', 'foward', 'watching', 'shows', 'television', 'see', 'what', 'stunts', 'are', 'going', 'come', 'up', 'next', 'course', 'see', 'who', 'going', 'win', 'money.I', 'have', 'hope', 'challenges', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'face', 'come', 'one', 'day', 'life', 'too', 'short', 'not', 'live', 'well', 'being', 'afraid', 'certain', 'challenges', 'life', 'not', 'good', 'course', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'stunts', 'do', 'have', 'fear', 'heights', 'would', 'like', 'face', 'come.The', 'only', 'problem', 'can', 'see', 'sets', 'watch', 'one', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'watch', 'again', 'have', 'got', 'moneys', 'worth', 'price', 'not', 'bad', 'only', '20', 'have', 'let', 'other', 'people', 'borrow', 'set', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'can', 'sell', 'back', 'Amazon', 'Ebay', 'get', 'tired', 'make', 'money', 'back', 'choose', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'sets', 'do', 'not', 'sell', 'much', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'type', 'gross', 'out', 'show', 'not', 'type', 'show', 'would', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'hope', 'continue', 'complete', 'rest', 'seasons', 'dvd', 'also', 'offer', 'sets', 'really', 'reasonable', 'price', 'so', 'will', 'get', 'are', 'money', 'worth', 'what', 'buy.All', 'recommend', 'buying', 'set', 'anyone', 'who', 'Fear', 'Factor', 'course', 'always', 'good', 'conversation', 'starter', 'groups', 'people', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'together', 'season', 'good', 'variety', 'episodes', 'difficult', 'phisical', 'challenges', 'mental', 'challenges', 'eating', 'something', 'gross', 'very', 'fun', 'show', 'watch', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'stunts', 'home']",Fear Factor: The First Season
