822204,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B00023B1AI,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 1]","CSN came to the Los Angeles in 1983 in support of their Daylight Again album. The concer featured selections from their first 15 years of touring. Playing a powerhouse set that included material from the Woodstock years to Daylight Again this should have been a defining moment for the band. It was a great show for Stephen Stills and Graham Nash. David Crosby was catatonic throughout the show fighting his own personal demons rather than performing as a member of the band. Stills carried the show with his intense guitar playing and Nash's singing while not perfect was adequate for the occassion.This is a stripped down disc that features no extras. The highlights include: Suite Judy Blue Eyes, Wooden Ships, Southern Cross, For What its Worth, Long Time Gone and Teach Your Children.",4,More Like Stills and Nash in Concert,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,789,"['CSN', 'came', 'Los', 'Angeles', '1983', 'support', 'Daylight', 'Again', 'album', 'concer', 'featured', 'selections', 'first', '15', 'years', 'touring', 'Playing', 'powerhouse', 'set', 'included', 'material', 'Woodstock', 'years', 'Daylight', 'Again', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'defining', 'moment', 'band', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'Stephen', 'Stills', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'David', 'Crosby', 'was', 'catatonic', 'show', 'fighting', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'rather', 'performing', 'member', 'band', 'Stills', 'carried', 'show', 'intense', 'guitar', 'playing', 'Nash', 'singing', 'not', 'perfect', 'was', 'adequate', 'occassion.This', 'stripped', 'down', 'disc', 'extras', 'highlights', 'include', 'Suite', 'Judy', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'Wooden', 'Ships', 'Southern', 'Cross', 'What', 'Worth', 'Long', 'Time', 'Gone', 'Teach', 'Children']",N/A
822205,A30XZO9A3H5BYH,B00023B1AI,"Don Schmittdiel ""running_man""","[6, 7]","First off, hats off to P. Duffy, who writes quite an engaging review on this concert recording.  I don't agree with everything he had to say, but his riveting description of David Crosby's demeanor in this production is right on the money.  Basically, Crosby is as near to flatlining as any human being could possibly get.  He often appears on film like one of those life-size cardboard cut-outs you might buy of Elvis or James Dean.  His vocals, always Crosby's strength, are a sad, unemotional, hollow fascimile of what once was.  It is going through the motions personified.  P. Duffy questions whether Nash's Gibson was plugged in, but I listened closely to the audio track to see if I could hear Crosby's ""playing"", and I can't.  I don't see anything heroic in his on-stage presence, or in Stills or Nash aiding and abetting him being anywhere except a hospital.  That's the bad news.The mixed news is that this film was made.  The year was 1982, and Crosby, Stills and Nash were touring in support of their third album, 'Daylight Again'.  Luckily, video technology had caught up with the boys, and made it logical to put an entire concert on film.  I don't know of any earlier complete performance by the band that has been captured on video, save the acoustic PBS performance, although the complete Woodstock show is probably in the vault somewhere.  So the good news is we're fortunate to have this.  The bad news that mixes in is that the band was far from their peak, which occurred on the 1969 and 1970 tours.  By their 1974 tour with Neil Young, much of their music, while still compelling, had lost significant social importance.  David Crosby's compromised status robs many of the best CSN songs of their trademark harmonies, and neither Stills nor Nash are able to hit the high notes like they once did.  Furthermore, the track selection is to a degree geared to promoting the worse of their three collectible recordings, 'Daylight Again', and their late 1970's efforts.  There are many songs in the CSN catalog that deserve inclusion over 'Barrel of Pain', 'Blackbird' (these boys don't need to delve into anyone else's catalog), 'Magical Child', 'Cathedral' (give me 'Military Madness', please), and the studio take of 'Daylight Again' (not even a live performance).  Another unfortunate consequence is that the early 1980's was not an era that was kind to the wah-pedal guitar.  It's Stills' forte, and is sadly omitted here (catch an earful on his DVD with Manassas, or the live '4 Way Street' CD).And now the good news.  Let's start with the track selection.  As would be expected, David Crosby only tenders two lead vocals, an uninspired 'Delta', whose vocals seem to penetrate the night no more than a foot from the speakers, and the obligatory 'Long Time Gone', where David replaces true emotion with growling, and defers half of the chorus to Stills.  Given his equal standing in this band, we're fortunate that only two songs put David front and center.  Graham offers a couple nice tracks, including 'Chicago' and 'Just a Song Before I Go', but Stephen carries the show.  His guitar work is exemplary, especially on 'Suite: Judy Blue Eyes', where his soloing will have your jaw hanging.  'Treetop Flyer' is a nice rarity, well performed, although Stills all but apologizes for the content after singing it.There are a few songs included that we may never see a sterling performance of.  'Love the One You're With' live has never approached the full production wall-of-sound featured on Stills' first solo album, and 'For What It's Worth' and 'Teach Your Children' always seem to be used for the dreaded audience participation numbers, as they are here.  Somewhere in the vault is a live sound-check of Stills during his 1979 visit to Cuba performing 'For What It's Worth' solo with an electric guitar, and there is a 'Smothers Brother's Show' version by Buffalo Springfield, both of which need to be released in their entirety.I caught CSN at the Meadowbrook Music Festival on the campus of Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan on this 1982 tour, and found the performance less engaging than when I had first seen them in 1977.  I'm glad I saw them, however, since it was their last meaningful outing.  This production opens by noting that CSN were originally brought together at the home of Mama Cass Elliot in 1968, and closes by dedicating the film to her.  It is fitting since, in many ways, this film represents the swan song for CSN as a viable force on the music scene.",4,"I have good news, bad news, and mixed news...",1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,4507,"['First', 'off', 'P.', 'Duffy', 'who', 'quite', 'engaging', 'review', 'concert', 'recording', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'everything', 'had', 'say', 'riveting', 'description', 'David', 'Crosby', 'demeanor', 'production', 'right', 'money', 'Basically', 'Crosby', 'as', 'near', 'flatlining', 'human', 'being', 'could', 'possibly', 'get', 'often', 'film', 'one', 'life-size', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs', 'might', 'buy', 'Elvis', 'James', 'Dean', 'vocals', 'always', 'Crosby', 'strength', 'are', 'sad', 'unemotional', 'hollow', 'fascimile', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'going', 'motions', 'personified', 'P.', 'Duffy', 'questions', 'Nash', 'Gibson', 'was', 'plugged', 'listened', 'closely', 'audio', 'track', 'see', 'could', 'hear', 'Crosby', 'playing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'heroic', 'on-stage', 'presence', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'aiding', 'abetting', 'being', 'anywhere', 'hospital', 'bad', 'news.The', 'mixed', 'news', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'year', 'was', '1982', 'Crosby', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'were', 'touring', 'support', 'third', 'album', 'Again', 'Luckily', 'video', 'technology', 'had', 'caught', 'up', 'boys', 'made', 'logical', 'put', 'entire', 'concert', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'earlier', 'complete', 'performance', 'band', 'been', 'captured', 'video', 'save', 'acoustic', 'PBS', 'performance', 'complete', 'Woodstock', 'show', 'probably', 'vault', 'somewhere', 'good', 'news', ""'re"", 'fortunate', 'have', 'bad', 'news', 'mixes', 'band', 'was', 'far', 'peak', 'occurred', '1969', '1970', 'tours', '1974', 'tour', 'Neil', 'Young', 'much', 'music', 'still', 'compelling', 'had', 'lost', 'significant', 'social', 'importance', 'David', 'Crosby', 'compromised', 'status', 'robs', 'many', 'best', 'CSN', 'songs', 'trademark', 'harmonies', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'are', 'able', 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'once', 'did', 'Furthermore', 'track', 'selection', 'degree', 'geared', 'promoting', 'worse', 'three', 'collectible', 'recordings', ""'Daylight"", 'Again', 'late', '1970', 'efforts', 'are', 'many', 'songs', 'CSN', 'catalog', 'inclusion', ""'Barrel"", 'Pain', 'boys', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'delve', 'anyone', 'else', 'catalog', ""'Magical"", 'Child', ""'Cathedral"", 'give', ""'Military"", 'Madness', 'please', 'studio', 'take', ""'Daylight"", 'Again', 'not', 'even', 'live', 'performance', 'unfortunate', 'consequence', 'early', '1980', 'was', 'not', 'era', 'was', 'kind', 'wah-pedal', 'guitar', 'Stills', 'forte', 'sadly', 'omitted', 'here', 'catch', 'earful', 'DVD', 'Manassas', 'live', '4', 'Way', 'Street', 'CD', 'now', 'good', 'news', 'Let', 'start', 'track', 'selection', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'David', 'Crosby', 'only', 'two', 'lead', 'vocals', 'uninspired', ""'Delta"", 'vocals', 'seem', 'penetrate', 'night', 'no', 'more', 'foot', 'speakers', 'obligatory', ""'Long"", 'Time', 'Gone', 'where', 'David', 'true', 'emotion', 'growling', 'defers', 'half', 'chorus', 'Stills', 'Given', 'equal', 'standing', 'band', ""'re"", 'fortunate', 'only', 'two', 'songs', 'put', 'David', 'front', 'center', 'Graham', 'couple', 'nice', 'tracks', 'including', 'Song', 'Go', 'Stephen', 'show', 'guitar', 'work', 'exemplary', 'especially', ""'Suite"", 'Judy', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'where', 'soloing', 'will', 'have', 'jaw', 'hanging', 'Flyer', 'nice', 'rarity', 'well', 'performed', 'Stills', 'content', 'singing', 'it.There', 'are', 'few', 'songs', 'included', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'sterling', 'performance', ""'Love"", 'One', ""'re"", 'live', 'never', 'approached', 'full', 'production', 'wall-of-sound', 'featured', 'Stills', 'first', 'solo', 'album', 'What', 'Worth', ""'Teach"", 'Children', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'used', 'dreaded', 'audience', 'participation', 'numbers', 'are', 'here', 'Somewhere', 'vault', 'live', 'sound-check', 'Stills', '1979', 'visit', 'Cuba', 'performing', ""'For"", 'What', 'Worth', 'solo', 'electric', 'guitar', ""'Smothers"", 'Brother', 'Show', 'version', 'Buffalo', 'Springfield', 'need', 'be', 'released', 'entirety.I', 'caught', 'CSN', 'Meadowbrook', 'Music', 'Festival', 'campus', 'Oakland', 'University', 'Rochester', 'Michigan', '1982', 'tour', 'found', 'performance', 'less', 'engaging', 'when', 'had', 'first', 'seen', '1977', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'however', 'was', 'last', 'meaningful', 'outing', 'production', 'noting', 'CSN', 'were', 'originally', 'brought', 'together', 'home', 'Mama', 'Cass', 'Elliot', '1968', 'closes', 'dedicating', 'film', 'fitting', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'swan', 'song', 'CSN', 'viable', 'force', 'music', 'scene']",N/A

822210,A13FBTZ8SO8T3D,B00023B1AI,o dubhthaigh,"[76, 89]","You're not likely to come across a concert DVD as disturbing as this one. Shot in 1982, weeks before Crosby would appear at The Brandywine Club in West Chester, Pa, and then flee the advance of rushing FBI and US Marshalls to hole up in his boat in Florida before surrendering, this is one of the saddest portraits of an artist I have ever seen. It is also a shining moment for both Nash and Stills.To be sure, the Daylight Again Tour had been a personal disaster for Crosby. Stills and Nash were under extraordinary financial and professional pressure to pull this off amidst David's self-destruction. The CD itself was honestly a Stills-Nash CD with a song from Crosby. The recording sessions most frequently found Mike Finnegan taking Crosby's part. In the course of the concert tour, the three would come to blows in Philadelphia where Crosby had wandered off-stage to collapse with his crack pipe. By the time they got to LA, even Nash had given up and was determined, along with Stills, to rescue his own reputation. Crosby was a pariah to everyone, and now even his two closest professional allies could no longer bear his presence. Body language tells you everything in this DVD. Most of the time, Crosby is near catatonic, staring vacantly, absent-mindedly strumming occasional chords, slurring and humming his vocal parts, sweating far more from the horrors of his haze than from the bright stage lights. He stands stiff and looks pasty, exhausted, scared. If you have ever been with someone who is dying of cancer, Crosby has that look in his eyes that time of death is, inevitably, now a matter of weeks. Resignation and fear have numbed his every move. He tries several times to get off stage, to be turned around by someone so that he cannot resort to the pipe. Close ups of his hands show his skin looking absolutely terrible. It is painfully heartbreaking and Nash can not bear to look at the man with whom he had so soulfully bonded. Stills is keeping his distance, offering remarks on their friendship that are the kind you make when you are with someone who is dying. &quot;Wasted on the Way&quot; is directed at their comrade, who seems to register the pain in those lyrics in faint grimaces. Guided back to the piano for &quot;Delta&quot;, he has the gait of someone who is at the stage of hospice care. That he manages it at all, and that Nash, Finnegan and Stills  provide such redemptive treatments to Crosby's failing efforts is nothing short of miraculous. It is a triumph that seems to revive Crosby enough to get through the remainging few songs of the concert with more strength and focus than he had up to that point.For Stills, this is his shining hour. I never heard him this good before or after this concert. It leaves one wondering what happened to his voice, the clarity of his guitar playing, the powerful and soulful songs that blended so may genres as though he were a white Ray Charles? This concert features his band  and the sympathy they display is a thing of wonder. They are so on, it is their sheer power and sophistication that enables you not to rivet your entire attention on Crosby's decay. Stills covers so many aspects of his career from the CSN stuff to his solo work. His songs have an honesty that displayed a flawed character owning up to his shortcomings and yet finding both solace and renewal in music. You wonder if in fact he might have been imploring his lost colleague to find his way home. Stills rarely looks at Crosby and almost never touches him. Perhaps he has come to terms with what was happening and found the fight no longer worth it. He plays with great soul. His acoustic and electric work have never, ever been so eloquent. Precious rarities are performed here: &quot;Treetop Flyer&quot; and McCartney's &quot;Blackbird&quot;. They are the best renditions of these that I have ever heard Stills deliver.Nash is the energetic cheerleader. It is always comical to see him hold a Gibson electric, and I wouldn't bet it was ever plugged in, ala Linda McCartney, but his singing is as perfectly registered as it has ever been. He and Stills put categorically everything they had into this performance and left nothing on the table or in the dressing room. They are incandescently brilliant together. Nash's songs are another matter. His &quot;Barrel of Pain&quot; is a great, great song. His encouragement to the young to vote against those who would pollute the environment focused and commanding, and resonates now more than ever. On the other hand, he can write real drivel. &quot;Miracle Child&quot; is a lovely sentiment, and a horribly written song. In fact, I'm not sure it qualifies as a song. More like musings set to random chords. &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; needs to be retired, even in 1982. &quot;Cathedral&quot; is silly bombast, and given that it is the tale of a Brit too wanked on LCD to appreciate that he is spouting crap, seems an inappropriate inclusion in a show where his partner is literally dying on stage from the ravages of crack, cocaine and heroin. &quot;Just a Song Before I go&quot;, however, is a thing of beauty as is &quot;Wind on the Water.&quot;I believe it is an extraordinary act of courage and humility for CSN to release this concert, not because the music is so great, but because of what else is happening. I would have liked to hear the reflections of the three of them looking back on this now, especially David, who has emerged such an entirely new man. Perhaps even some direction on where to get help, or how you can help a loved one who is either in extremis, as Cros was surely here, or heading there inspite of themselves. In the end, any AA or NA program will tell you that the person has to hit bottom, but none of us likes to give up on the ones we love. This film draws just that conclusion.",4,&quot;I had my hand on Death's doorhandle...&quot;,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,5820,"[""'re"", 'not', 'likely', 'come', 'concert', 'DVD', 'as', 'disturbing',

Even though Graham is usually the higher voice in the harmony, it is still Graham that ties the other two together. I recently bought a newer concert that added Neal Young but it is not near as good as this one. This is by far a better performance.",5,Like Going To A Musical Church,1312502400,"08 5, 2011",2011,676,"['finally', 'broke', 'down', 'bought', 'DVD', 'concert', 'have', 'owned', 'CED', 'copy', '25', 'years', 'CED', 'Player', 'more', 'less', 'dust', 'leaving', '150', 'movies', 'way', 'view', 'them.This', 'concert', 'was', 'performed', 'just', 'peak', 'David', 'abuse', 'problems', 'eyes', 'are', 'downright', 'scary', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'OREO', 'cookie', 'racial', 'inferances', 'intended', 'Stephen', 'David', 'being', 'held', 'together', 'Graham', 'Even', 'Graham', 'usually', 'higher', 'voice', 'harmony', 'still', 'Graham', 'other', 'two', 'together', 'recently', 'bought', 'newer', 'concert', 'added', 'Neal', 'Young', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'far', 'better', 'performance']",N/A

This is the best concert for Stephen Stills because he played the guitar so very well and it was a masterpiece.  I heard one review say that the crowd was boring.  That is not true, they seemed pretty excited about this concert.  If you have sourround sound than this is going to be a great experience for you.  Some of these songs on here were songs I had never even heard before.  My favorite song on here was Suite: Judy blue eyes.  I like the original recording of it and the concert version.  Stephen Stills did in my opinion his greatest song, tree top flyer.  That was great guitar playing and it just blew my mind.  Nash's eyes look really strange in this but it makes the band look interesting.  I heard Nash went to prison for drugs.  Well, this is my favorite concert from CSN and I recommend it for any body who likes good soothing music.  God bless you and have a great day.",4,CSN did it again,1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,1010,"['are', 'two', 'other', 'concerts', 'CSN', 'one', 'best', 'Crosby', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'weird', 'strange', 'o.k', 'best', 'concert', 'Stephen', 'Stills', 'played', 'guitar', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'heard', 'one', 'review', 'say', 'crowd', 'was', 'boring', 'not', 'true', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'excited', 'concert', 'have', 'sourround', 'sound', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'experience', 'songs', 'here', 'were', 'songs', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'favorite', 'song', 'here', 'was', 'Suite', 'Judy', 'blue', 'eyes', 'original', 'recording', 'concert', 'version', 'Stephen', 'Stills', 'did', 'opinion', 'greatest', 'song', 'tree', 'top', 'flyer', 'was', 'great', 'guitar', 'playing', 'just', 'blew', 'mind', 'Nash', 'eyes', 'look', 'really', 'strange', 'band', 'look', 'interesting', 'heard', 'Nash', 'went', 'prison', 'drugs', 'Well', 'favorite', 'concert', 'CSN', 'recommend', 'body', 'who', 'good', 'soothing', 'music', 'God', 'bless', 'have', 'great', 'day']",N/A
