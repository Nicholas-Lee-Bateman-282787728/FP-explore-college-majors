1279695,A1PN1R385J3NP,B002N7W3OE,Aaron Small,"[19, 19]","Originally filmed for the US television series Sound Stage and broadcast in July 2009, this 70-minute, 12-song DVD showcases Billy Idol in concert at the Congress Theater in Chicago, IL. At 54 years of age, Idol is arguably in the best shape of his career. Not an ounce of fat can be found on his chiselled, sweat-soaked body. Alongside his partner in crime, guitarist Steve Stevens, drummer Brian Tichy (Pride & Glory, Gilby Clarke) keyboardist Derek Sherinian (Alice Cooper, Dream Theater) and bassist Stephen McGrath, Idol truly is one of a kind. He introduces `Rebel Yell' as ""The New American National Anthem."" Despite the fact that `Dancing With Myself' and `Flesh For Fantasy' are `80s staples, Idol has his band jam on them in a free-flow format that makes them seem fresh as the morning dew. Two brand new, previously unreleased songs are performed as well: the sexually charged `Touch My Love' and a more remorseful number `Cry'. It's a pity that only a pair of songs from 2005's Devil's Playground are aired live, as that was a barnstormer of an album. But we're treated to renditions of Generation X classics `Ready Steady Go' and `Kiss Me Deadly' - all you can ask for is more, which isn't unreasonable actually. There's no backstage, pre/post show footage, interviews or bonus material. But in this case it's quality over quantity and the focus is solely on the top-notch live performance.",4,In Super Overdrive Live,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,1403,"['Originally', 'filmed', 'US', 'television', 'series', 'Sound', 'Stage', 'broadcast', 'July', '2009', '70-minute', '12-song', 'DVD', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'concert', 'Congress', 'Theater', 'Chicago', 'IL', '54', 'years', 'age', 'Idol', 'arguably', 'best', 'shape', 'career', 'Not', 'ounce', 'fat', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'chiselled', 'sweat-soaked', 'body', 'Alongside', 'partner', 'crime', 'guitarist', 'Steve', 'Stevens', 'drummer', 'Brian', 'Tichy', 'Pride', 'Glory', 'Gilby', 'Clarke', 'keyboardist', 'Derek', 'Sherinian', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'bassist', 'Stephen', 'McGrath', 'Idol', 'truly', 'one', 'kind', 'Rebel', 'Yell', 'New', 'American', 'National', 'Anthem', 'fact', 'Dancing', 'Myself', 'Flesh', 'Fantasy', 'are', '80s', 'staples', 'Idol', 'band', 'jam', 'free-flow', 'format', 'seem', 'fresh', 'morning', 'dew', 'Two', 'brand', 'new', 'previously', 'unreleased', 'songs', 'are', 'performed', 'well', 'sexually', 'charged', 'Touch', 'My', 'Love', 'more', 'remorseful', 'number', 'Cry', 'pity', 'only', 'pair', 'songs', '2005', 'Devil', 'Playground', 'are', 'aired', 'live', 'was', 'barnstormer', 'album', ""'re"", 'treated', 'renditions', 'Generation', 'X', 'classics', 'Ready', 'Steady', 'Go', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'Deadly', 'can', 'ask', 'more', ""n't"", 'unreasonable', 'actually', 'backstage', 'pre/post', 'show', 'footage', 'interviews', 'bonus', 'material', 'case', 'quality', 'quantity', 'focus', 'solely', 'top-notch', 'live', 'performance']",N/A

But, after watching it, I do think it is ""fairly"" recent, but I'm not sure. In the 1980's, Billy Idol, had his sister, playing keyboards in his band and she is not included in this concert dvd. The information does state that it was filmed in Chicago's Congress Theater in July, but it doesn't list the year. The Concert is mostly ""Hard-Rocking"", but it is ""Partially Smooth"" at times, depending on the song. The total running time is approximately 70 minutes.The line-up:Billy Idol - Lead VocalsElectric Lead Guitar - Steve StevensDrums - Brian McGrathKeyboards - Derek SherinianThe Song Set:1.Super Overdrive2.Dancing With Myself3.Flesh For Fantasy4.Touch My Love5.White Wedding6.Scream7.Eyes Without a Face (Partially Smooth)8.Cry9.Blue Highway10.Ready Steady Go11.Rebel Yell (Hard-Rocking!!!!)(At the Hard Rock Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, on the second floor, between the bar and the slot machines, there is a display of Billy Idol & Rebel Yell, it includes a guitar, with the body of it, painted as a rebel flag, I have a picture of it.)12.Kiss Me DeadlyThis is Billy Idol and Band at their best, and I recommend it.

So, with Billy Idol and the band bathed in their own sweat as they perform makes for a cool visual experience in High Definition.And not just the band either.
