My tapes didn't hold her interest so I thought I'd give these a try. What a hit!!! I do it with her, too. We are both enjoying them. She asks for it by name... ""Yoga kids! Yoga kids!"". I've caught her doing some of the poses and breathing even when the DVD isn't running.

856125,AF3LMPMWDKI9K,B00062DKMM,Sunny,"[16, 17]","This is a nice yoga video for children, as are the others in this series.  Ms. Wenig does a nice job of presenting the movements to the children (some other presenters use such a sing-song-y or overly mature manner).  One thing that is really nice about this particular video is the educational information it offers to the children during each pose or movement; to my recollection all are science-based.  I use these videos with my own children as well as my Kindergarten students.  While they all enjoy this video; evident by the regurgitation of the educational pieces offered to them; their favorite as a whole is really the ABC's Yoga Kids Video.

856126,AMJ3FWPTN7MRK,B00062DKMM,Val M.,"[0, 0]","I chose this beginner yoga dvd for my 5 year old grand daughter because my now 19 year old daughter loved it so much as a youngester. My daughter remembers the vhs tape as being fun, and she credits it with being responsible for her scoring a goal at her soccer game because she did her &#34;yoga tape right before the game'. A cherished memory for her. So when my grand daughter expressed interest in doing yoga with me, this dvd was the obvious choice. I am happy to report that she LOVES this dvd as much as my daughter did so many years ago. And would you believe that they have the same two favorite poses? Turtle and Lion pose. There's about 7 or 8 poses demostrated for the children by children, with some narration through the pose about how to relate to the pose or how the pose can help in daily life. Not so much how to do the pose. The narrator does tell the kids to just keep practicing, it will get easier. There are also some breating exercises that are nice also, deep cleansing breaths at the beginning, and &#34;bunny breathing&#34; near the end of the tape. Throughout the dvd there is some narration about nature and the way humans and nature relate to each other; the narrator does a good job here also. At the end of the dvd they of course say namaste to each other, and the narrator does a great job of explaining why they say this.  So, soothing narration, children demonstrating the poses, some fun moments, some educational moments, and breathing exercises, make this a 5 star dvd for this family.  Hope this helps the future yogis out there.",5,Still a winner,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1568,"['chose', 'beginner', 'dvd', '5', 'year', 'old', 'grand', 'daughter', 'now', '19', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'youngester', 'daughter', 'vhs', 'tape', 'being', 'fun', 'being', 'responsible', 'scoring', 'goal', 'soccer', 'game', 'did', '34', 'tape', 'right', 'game', 'cherished', 'memory', 'So', 'when', 'grand', 'daughter', 'expressed', 'interest', 'doing', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'was', 'obvious', 'choice', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'dvd', 'as', 'much', 'daughter', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'believe', 'have', 'same', 'two', 'favorite', 'poses', 'Turtle', 'Lion', 'pose', '7', '8', 'poses', 'demostrated', 'children', 'children', 'narration', 'pose', 'how', 'relate', 'pose', 'how', 'pose', 'can', 'help', 'daily', 'life', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'do', 'pose', 'narrator', 'tell', 'kids', 'just', 'keep', 'practicing', 'will', 'get', 'easier', 'are', 'also', 'breating', 'exercises', 'are', 'nice', 'also', 'deep', 'cleansing', 'breaths', 'beginning', '34', 'bunny', 'breathing', '34', 'end', 'tape', 'dvd', 'narration', 'nature', 'way', 'humans', 'nature', 'relate', 'other', 'narrator', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'also', 'end', 'dvd', 'course', 'say', 'namaste', 'other', 'narrator', 'great', 'job', 'explaining', 'why', 'say', 'So', 'soothing', 'narration', 'children', 'demonstrating', 'poses', 'fun', 'moments', 'educational', 'moments', 'breathing', 'exercises', 'make', '5', 'star', 'dvd', 'family', 'Hope', 'future', 'out', 'there']",Yoga basics: Yoga For Kids: For Ages 3-6
