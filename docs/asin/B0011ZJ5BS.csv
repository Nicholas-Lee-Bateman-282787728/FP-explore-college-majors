Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[3, 3]","The stirring redemption of Ethiopia's falasha Jews and their miraculous voyage to Israel is the subject of this movie that is often very moving, especially in its first half, but then tries to do too much and loses its way.The hero of this movie, Shlomo, is not Jewish. We meet him at age nine almost starving to death in a Sudanese refugee camp. His mother sees the chance to save him by smuggling him on board a plane to Israel as the substitute son of a Jewish mother whose son has died. The new mother dies soon after his arrival in Israel and he is eventually adopted by an Israeli family of French origins.We follow him growing up, encountering gross racism from some Israelis but also kindness from others. To say he has an identity problem is an understatement. He is living a lie, forced to forge a completely new identity as a Jew, knowing that his mother sacrificed her own life for him, telling him to ""Live and Become.""The first hour of the movie is very strong. We identify strongly with this poor, confused little kid, trying to come to terms with a new country that is not entirely hospitable, and a new family.But later sections take us all the way through repeated wars, conflicts and world events, springing up quickly through 15 years of history. Shlomo becomes a doctor in France, falls in love with an Israeli girl, returns to serve in the IDF during the second Intifadah, and winds up caring for starving people back in Sudan where the movie reaches a predictable and sentimental climax that left me dry-eyed.There's a lot to admire in this movie but it did lose its focus for me in the closing minutes.",3,Moving in parts but tries to do too much,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,1626,"['stirring', 'redemption', 'Ethiopia', 'falasha', 'Jews', 'miraculous', 'voyage', 'Israel', 'subject', 'movie', 'often', 'very', 'moving', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'then', 'tries', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'way.The', 'hero', 'movie', 'Shlomo', 'not', 'Jewish', 'meet', 'age', 'nine', 'almost', 'starving', 'death', 'Sudanese', 'refugee', 'camp', 'mother', 'chance', 'save', 'smuggling', 'board', 'plane', 'Israel', 'substitute', 'son', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'son', 'died', 'new', 'mother', 'dies', 'soon', 'arrival', 'Israel', 'eventually', 'adopted', 'Israeli', 'family', 'French', 'origins.We', 'follow', 'growing', 'up', 'encountering', 'gross', 'racism', 'Israelis', 'also', 'kindness', 'others', 'say', 'identity', 'problem', 'understatement', 'living', 'lie', 'forced', 'forge', 'completely', 'new', 'identity', 'Jew', 'knowing', 'mother', 'sacrificed', 'own', 'life', 'telling', 'Live', 'Become', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'very', 'strong', 'identify', 'strongly', 'poor', 'confused', 'little', 'kid', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'new', 'country', 'not', 'entirely', 'hospitable', 'new', 'family.But', 'later', 'sections', 'take', 'way', 'repeated', 'wars', 'conflicts', 'world', 'events', 'springing', 'up', 'quickly', '15', 'years', 'history', 'Shlomo', 'doctor', 'France', 'love', 'Israeli', 'girl', 'returns', 'serve', 'IDF', 'second', 'Intifadah', 'up', 'caring', 'starving', 'people', 'back', 'Sudan', 'where', 'movie', 'predictable', 'sentimental', 'climax', 'left', 'lot', 'admire', 'movie', 'did', 'lose', 'focus', 'closing', 'minutes']",Live and Become
1133469,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B0011ZJ5BS,Danny G.,"[0, 0]","Live and Become is is about never giving up, no matter what! It's an optimistic story. When you do good in your life, good comes back to you when you least expect it.Parts of this story are incredibly gut-wrenching, I even had to fast forward the movie, at times. Vicariously experiencing the incredible suffering taking place in a refugee camp was unbearable. On the other hand, we get to see a relatively normal Middle Class existence through most of the story, which is quite a relief!While this is a fictional story the setting is 100% historically accurate. I felt like I was reliving the news from the 1980's! I remember the Falashas, also known as Ethiopian Jews and their evacuation from Ethiopia and the Sudan. I also remember what a hard time they were given by a large segment of the Israeli population, especially by the Ultra Orthodox religious establishment who did not consider them to be real Jews.The racism and constant humiliation experienced by Schlomo was mind-numbing, and symbolic of how the Falashas were actually treated back then. What a very sad commentary on the Israeli society of the time!I immensely enjoyed getting to see Schlomo played by 3 different actors: one as 9-year old, then as a teenager and finally as a man in his 20's. We literally get to see Schlomo turn into this incredibly brave and self-confident man. What a moving story! After watching it, I guarantee you it will strengthen your belief in a Supreme Being!See:The Falashas: A Short History of the Ethiopian JewsandFalasha: Exile of the Black JewsandFalasha Anthology (Yale Judaica Series)",5,If Only I Could Be Fortunate Enough To Meet Someone Like Shlomo In Real Life!,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,1590,"['Live', 'Become', 'about', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'matter', 'what', 'optimistic', 'story', 'When', 'do', 'good', 'life', 'good', 'back', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'it.Parts', 'story', 'are', 'incredibly', 'gut-wrenching', 'even', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'movie', 'times', 'Vicariously', 'experiencing', 'incredible', 'suffering', 'taking', 'place', 'refugee', 'camp', 'was', 'unbearable', 'other', 'hand', 'get', 'see', 'relatively', 'normal', 'Middle', 'Class', 'existence', 'most', 'story', 'quite', 'relief', 'fictional', 'story', 'setting', '100', '%', 'historically', 'accurate', 'felt', 'was', 'reliving', 'news', '1980', 'remember', 'Falashas', 'also', 'known', 'Ethiopian', 'Jews', 'evacuation', 'Ethiopia', 'Sudan', 'also', 'remember', 'what', 'hard', 'time', 'were', 'given', 'large', 'segment', 'Israeli', 'population', 'especially', 'Ultra', 'Orthodox', 'religious', 'establishment', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'consider', 'be', 'real', 'Jews.The', 'racism', 'constant', 'humiliation', 'experienced', 'Schlomo', 'was', 'mind-numbing', 'symbolic', 'how', 'Falashas', 'were', 'actually', 'treated', 'back', 'then', 'What', 'very', 'sad', 'commentary', 'Israeli', 'society', 'time', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'getting', 'see', 'Schlomo', 'played', '3', 'different', 'actors', 'one', '9-year', 'old', 'then', 'teenager', 'finally', 'man', '20', 'literally', 'get', 'see', 'Schlomo', 'turn', 'incredibly', 'brave', 'self-confident', 'man', 'What', 'moving', 'story', 'watching', 'guarantee', 'will', 'strengthen', 'belief', 'Supreme', 'Being', 'See', 'Falashas', 'Short', 'History', 'Ethiopian', 'JewsandFalasha', 'Exile', 'Black', 'JewsandFalasha', 'Anthology', 'Yale', 'Judaica', 'Series']",Live and Become
1133470,A3UM5IR9AZL1WZ,B0011ZJ5BS,"David Crumm ""Editor of ReadTheSpirit magazine""","[24, 24]","""Live and Become"" is one family's fictionalized story of the historic exodus of thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel in the 1980s.Today, Ethiopian Jews aren't quite as surprising a group as they were when they first emerged on the world stage. This year, the story of world-class peace activist Ephraim Isaac showed up as one of the honorees in ""Interfaith Heroes 2.""As a journalist in the 1980s, I visited Ethiopian Jewish communities in Israel and experienced first-hand the bittersweet nature of their exodus from life-threatening conditions in Ethiopia to this new homeland. While Israelis, overall, worked hard to make them feel welcome -- they also experienced bigotry, suspicion and the bewilderment of cultural displacement.In Radu Mihaileanu's movie, ""Live and Become,"" he heightens the passionate connection with Ethiopia. He introduces his main character, Schlomo, as a 9-year-old boy who two Ethiopian mothers nearing their own deaths decide to ""save"" by declaring him a Jewish child.When Schlomo arrives in Israel, he must deal with an intense homesickness, bigotry from a few white Jewish neighbors and a guilty secret about his non-Jewish identity that he fears may lead to his imprisonment. That's a whole lot for a 9-year-old boy to shoulder and it's understandable that, most of the time, Schlomo walks through his new life with his handsome face bowed.But Schlomo is strong, extremely smart, talented at languages -- and in his heart he carries an almost instinctively Jewish love of God and the world. He pours his life into Torah study. He strives to become even better than those few students who want to humiliate him.Finally, Schlomo benefits from an Israeli family who adopt him and become his strongest defense. If you're not Jewish and don't particularly care about Israel -- the film still is stirring. On a human level, this is a heart-warming movie about the spiritual callings of both parents and children.The film runs nearly two and a half hours and, eventually, Schlomo becomes a young man and falls in love with a white Jewish girl, named Sarah. Unfortunately, Sarah and Schlomo have a major crisis in their relationship. I won't spoil the outcome, but as their emotions flow back and forth -- Sarah eventually says to Schlomo: ""It is amazing how many mothers love you!"" And that's certainly true, we have to agree.As a parent watching this film myself, that scene was stirring. This is a rare movie if only because the parents (with one or two horrible exceptions) are depicted from start to finish as fiercely, compassionately committed in their love of their children. There's a great deal of hope portrayed here for the world's orphaned children -- and that's a very welcome message these days.In the end, that makes ""Live and Become"" is a universal experience.",5,A Universally Inspiring Drama about the Exodus of a Nearly Forgotten People,1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,2801,"['Live', 'Become', 'one', 'family', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'historic', 'exodus', 'thousands', 'Ethiopian', 'Jews', 'Israel', '1980s.Today', 'Ethiopian', 'Jews', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'surprising', 'group', 'were', 'when', 'first', 'emerged', 'world', 'stage', 'year', 'story', 'world-class', 'peace', 'activist', 'Ephraim', 'Isaac', 'showed', 'up', 'one', 'honorees', 'Interfaith', 'Heroes', '2', 'journalist', '1980s', 'visited', 'Ethiopian', 'Jewish', 'communities', 'Israel', 'experienced', 'first-hand', 'bittersweet', 'nature', 'exodus', 'life-threatening', 'conditions', 'Ethiopia', 'new', 'homeland', 'Israelis', 'overall', 'worked', 'hard', 'make', 'feel', 'welcome', 'also', 'experienced', 'bigotry', 'suspicion', 'bewilderment', 'cultural', 'displacement.In', 'Radu', 'Mihaileanu', 'movie', 'Live', 'Become', 'passionate', 'connection', 'Ethiopia', 'main', 'character', 'Schlomo', '9-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'two', 'Ethiopian', 'mothers', 'nearing', 'own', 'deaths', 'decide', 'save', 'declaring', 'Jewish', 'child.When', 'Schlomo', 'Israel', 'must', 'deal', 'intense', 'homesickness', 'bigotry', 'few', 'white', 'Jewish', 'neighbors', 'guilty', 'secret', 'non-Jewish', 'identity', 'may', 'lead', 'imprisonment', 'whole', 'lot', '9-year-old', 'boy', 'shoulder', 'understandable', 'most', 'time', 'Schlomo', 'new', 'life', 'handsome', 'face', 'bowed.But', 'Schlomo', 'strong', 'extremely', 'smart', 'talented', 'languages', 'heart', 'almost', 'instinctively', 'Jewish', 'love', 'God', 'world', 'life', 'Torah', 'study', 'become', 'even', 'better', 'few', 'students', 'who', 'want', 'humiliate', 'him.Finally', 'Schlomo', 'benefits', 'Israeli', 'family', 'who', 'become', 'strongest', 'defense', ""'re"", 'not', 'Jewish', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'Israel', 'film', 'still', 'stirring', 'human', 'level', 'heart-warming', 'movie', 'spiritual', 'callings', 'parents', 'children.The', 'film', 'nearly', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'eventually', 'Schlomo', 'young', 'man', 'love', 'white', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'named', 'Sarah', 'Unfortunately', 'Sarah', 'Schlomo', 'have', 'major', 'crisis', 'relationship', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'outcome', 'emotions', 'flow', 'back', 'forth', 'Sarah', 'eventually', 'Schlomo', 'amazing', 'how', 'many', 'mothers', 'love', 'certainly', 'true', 'have', 'agree.As', 'parent', 'watching', 'film', 'scene', 'was', 'stirring', 'rare', 'movie', 'only', 'parents', 'one', 'two', 'horrible', 'exceptions', 'are', 'depicted', 'start', 'finish', 'fiercely', 'compassionately', 'committed', 'love', 'children', 'great', 'deal', 'hope', 'portrayed', 'here', 'world', 'orphaned', 'children', 'very', 'welcome', 'message', 'end', 'Live', 'Become', 'universal', 'experience']",Live and Become
1133471,A1ENC0ALMHVBU,B0011ZJ5BS,"D. HupFons ""Hup234""","[4, 4]","""Go, live and become,"" is a line delivered by a heartbroken Ethiopian Christian mother as she sends her 9-yr old son off to Israel to escape starvation and the harsh conditions that Ethiopian refugees experienced during their relocation from their famine-stricken homeland.  This cryptic but compelling farewell will guide (and haunt) her son as he accompanies Hana, a bereaved Ethiopian Jewish mother, whose own 9-yr old son Schlomo (Solomon) had died that very same day during their relocation to Israel under Operation Moses in late 1984.Thus begins a tale of intrigue, love, and deceit.  The young Ethiopian Christian boy assumes the identity of Schlomo, an Ethiopian Jew, and is relocated covertly with his ""new"" mother by the CIA and the Israeli Defense Forces to Jerusalem.  Young Schlomo struggles to protect his assumed identity as he assimilates into the Israeli culture.Romanian-French filmmaker Radu Mihaileanu deftly directs this French-Israeli-Belgian epic drama.  He weaves together the various themes and subplots of racial and ethnic antagonism, adoption, maternal love, family separation, acculturation, and identity crisis.  Some will say that so many themes are not treated adequately, but I think that the number of issues that Schlomo experiences during the 20 year span of the film serve to highlight the many personal and cultural dilemmas that he faces.His coming of age is a daunting one.  At the risk of having his false identity revealed and face deportation back to the Sudan or Ethiopia, Schlomo must forge his own identity while having to learn Hebrew and French and the nuances that are part of those 2 cultures. Those pressures weigh heavily on him at times and test his mettle as he struggles to BECOME.This is a heartfelt drama with fine performances by Abecassis as Schlomo's adoptive mother and by each of the 3 male actors who portray him, but especially Sirak Sabahat as the adult Schlomo.

1133474,AEJ51LB0XGGY,B0011ZJ5BS,"Jaroslav Melgr ""jaroski""","[2, 2]","This is one of the most moving and stirring films ever! It's delves into many issues, but primarily addresses the question of what does it mean to be Jewish, which is beautifully woven into a story of parental and sacrificial love. It helps one appreciate what we have and how many things we enjoy in our lives. If we spent more of our time being thankful for what we have and helping each other out, we'd live in a better world.In a refugee camp somewhere in Sudan live Ethiopian Christians and Jews side by side. A 9-year old Christian boy (later named Shlomo, i.e. Solomon) lives in a tent with his mother next to Hannah's tent. Hannah is Jewish and also has only one son, same age as Shlomo. Life in the camp is very difficult and hunger, thirst and disease are rampant. The Israeli government, aware of persecutions heaped upon Ethiopian Jews commence Operation Moses -- flying airplanes into Sudan and shuttling Jewish refugees into Israel. The day Hannah and her son are to be picked up Hannah's son dies and is buried. As the airplanes arrive that night and the Jewish refugees begin to line up for boarding, other non-Jewish refugees wistfully look on. Shlomo's mother gives Shlomo a hug and then pushes him away, points to the line and tells him ""Go! Go, live and become! And only then come back."" Then she points to Hannah who's now standing in the line alone. Perplexed and frightened, Shlomo does not want to leave his mother. But she insists, repeats her order and so he goes and stands in line next to Hannah and takes her hand. Hannah is surprised and startled at first, but after looking at Shlomo's mother and then at Shlomo she understands. Staying in the camp means only one thing - death. She smiles at Shlomo, takes his hand and claims Shlomo as her son. Thus begins the story of Shlomo.Shortly upon arrival in Israel, Hannah dies in the hospital. But before she dies, she tells Shlomo of her family and ancestral history and urges him to remember her family line, study her religion and keep on living. This leaves Shlomo alone in a new land, but more importantly without the support of the only person who knew of and was helping Shlomo to bear his secret -- that he isn't Jewish. Shlomo is then placed in an orphanage where he struggles, refuses to eat, gets in trouble and things simply aren't going well for him.  Not only he's terribly alone missing his mother and feeling out of place, he's also burdened by the knowledge that he isn't a Jew and that he should not be there. After struggling to handle him, the staff at the orphanage reaches out to Israeli families, one of which decides to adopt him. Yael and Yoram have two children of their own but want to do something for their country and for the newly arrived Ethiopian Jews. They aren't religious Jews, but support Shlomo in his study of the Torah. Despite their every effort to make Shlomo feel at home and loved it's a struggle. Shlomo is still burdened by guilt about his non-Jewish origins and is terribly homesick. He faces opposition at school from parents of white children who are afraid he may have negative impact on their children. But Yael, his third mother sticks up for him. However, Shlomo is withdrawn from his new adoptive family and from his surroundings. But he's trying to follow the orders given him by his real mother and by Hannah - trying to become a Jew.So Shlomo is growing up in a new place, trying to hang in there. At night, especially during the full moon he looks out his window and talks to the moon - as if giving a progress report to his real mother back in the refugee camp. As life goes on Shlomo becomes genuinely bent on learning the Torah and everything there is to know about Judaism so he can become a Jew. Although the knowledge of being a Christian is still a big burden for him, he begins to be optimistic. On one occasion he tells his mother/full moon; ""One day I'll be a real Jew and speak Yiddish like Mrs. Zilbermann (their elderly neighbor whom they help out) and say 'Oi-oi-oi, mein Gott.'""Shlomo goes on to becoming a teenager and later an adult, meeting a beautiful girl, becoming a medical doctor, serving in the military, getting married, and simply lives and becomes. But instead of detailing the rest of the plot I would like to highlight a couple of ideas that are central to the movie throughout.One of the most prominent ideas of the movie is the question ""what does it mean to be Jewish?"" Clearly, Shlomo isn't Jewish by birth. But he sincerely tries to do everything he can to become Jewish.  The Torah allows for converts and acceptance to the fold.  Shlomo studies the Torah more intensely and sincerely than just about any of his peers, observes the law and also does the deeds of the law. Yet, he feels that should someone find out the secret of his Christian origin, he'd be put in prison. At one point, the teenage Shlomo actually goes to the police station to turn himself in.  But the police man does not even let him talk. The police man is a Jewish immigrant from Romania and is keenly aware of various social issues in Israel.  Especially the fact that some Israelis question the inclusion of Ethiopians in their society and the legitimacy of their Jewishness. So the police man tells Shlomo to keep on going with his life, ignore the detractors and not to give up. The police man points out that while he's also an immigrant no one bothers him because he's white and no one can readily tell he's an immigrant.  So he feels it's unfair that people should pick on Ethiopian immigrants because they are black.This is a very serious question hotly debated in Israel -- should people be judged for their racial background regardless of who they are or what they believe? With the history of the Holocaust and the persecutions brought upon Jews because of their racial origin, many Israelis feel that Jews should not judge anyone on account of their racial background.  On the other hand, there is the question of maintaining the unique nature of the state of Israel as a Jewish state.  Hence the question, who is a Jew and who isn't?  Are Jews only those born to Jewish parents or can one become a Jew?  And what about those who are born Jews, but don't observe Jewish religion or tradition?The other idea so beautifully depicted in the movie is one of love, especially parental and sacrificial love. First, Shlomo's real mother loved him so much she was willing to give him up rather than have him with her and face an almost certain death. Second, Hana became a great adoptive mother for Shlomo, although only for a short time. She, fully understanding the motives of Shlomo's real mother, showed a great love by saving a stranger in the hour of her own grief. Third, Yael was initially apprehensive about adopting Shlomo, worrying about the impact of that decision on her own children.  But she grew to love Shlomo without reservations and stood by him like his own mother would. She loved him for who he was not for his lineage, color of skin or religion.In fact, at a critical point in Shlomo's adult life, Yael helped straighten things out between Shlomo and Sarah, Shlomo's young bride. After their marriage Shlomo shared his secret - that he isn't Jewish - with Sarah, who got very upset and temporarily left him. In his hour of despair, Shlomo went to Yael and told her of his secret as well.  Yael, like a true mother stepped in and told Sarah Shlomo's entire life story.  She helped Sarah see beyond the birth lineage -- Sarah came from a very religious family who disowned her when she married Shlomo because her father thinks the Ethiopian immigrants aren't Jews but pretentious Christians wanting to escape misery in Ethiopia. However, Sarah returns to Shlomo and exclaims ""it's amazing how many mothers love you!"" Which is a beautiful way to summarize the movie and highlight one of its central ideas in a memorable line. Indeed, mother's love is probably the highest form of love the humans are capable of. Mothers love like no one else - they are able to look beyond not only the zits and warts, but more importantly our character flaws, weaknesses, etc. and love us despite them all.",5,One day I'll be a

1133475,A1FNW6H983I87V,B0011ZJ5BS,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[6, 6]","This is the story of Schlomo (Solomon), a 9 year old Ethiopian young boy whose Christian mother disguises him as an Ethiopian Jew to take the place of a Jewish boy his age who has just died and whose mother is being airlifted out of a Sudan refugee camp in 1984 as part of a rescue mission operated by the Israeli secret service to bring Ethiopian Jews to Israel. His mother's parting words as he very reluctantly leaves are 'go, live and become'. He does go and he does live (his 'new' mother dies shortly after arriving in Israel) and the film is about becoming. He is adopted by a secular Jewish family. Becoming is hard enough growing up under normal circumstances. What if you must keep the secret that you are not Jewish and should never have been admitted to the country, learn to live in family where you don't fit in easily, adapt to a culture that is foreign and unfriendly to blacks and experience all the many adolescent challenges of hormones, loneliness, and a great ache for your homeland and birth mother? How does one cope with all these challenges? The three actors that play the various stages of Schlomo's life do an outstanding job. There are many levels which hit your emotions as you watch this. You want to him to survive and mature but it's so difficult, the odds are not good and you know he most likely would have been dead had he stayed in Sudan. Somehow he must persevere and overcome and 'become'. A heart-breaking and uplifting story of the human spirit and the will to live and become.

Unlike many foreign films, the subtitles are very easy to read.  The first 25 minutes of the film might seem more like a docu-drama.  It begins in a refugee camp in Sudan, where an Ethiopian mother has just lost her only child, a son.  Days after, the Ethiopian Jews at the camp [known as the `Falasha'] are awaiting to be chosen for Operation Moses, the first airlift of Ethiopian Jews taken to Israel in 1984.  Among those waiting is the mother who is still grieving the lost her son.  Looking on, a Christian mother makes arrangements with the grieving Ethiopian Jew mother to take her young son instead, both women knowing this is a crime.  Yet, the Christian mother is determined and forces her son to `pretend' to be Jewish so that he can escape the poverty of the refugee camp, and have a chance of a better life.  She demands him, ""Go. Live and become.""  It's a sad beginning, however the drama slowly unfolds as the main character, Schlomo eventually meets his adoptive Israeli/French parents and eventually adjusts to life as a Jew, coping with racial bias and other challenges, all the while never forgetting his mother, his promise to her, and his homeland.Maizie Lucille JamesNovember 16, 2012",5,Great film about Operation Moses,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,1319,"['LIVE', 'BECOME', 'one', 'favorite', 'foreign', 'films', 'assimilating', 'adjusting', 'new', 'life', 'culture', 'many', 'foreign', 'films', 'subtitles', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'read', 'first', '25', 'minutes', 'film', 'might', 'seem', 'more', 'docu-drama', 'refugee', 'camp', 'Sudan', 'where', 'Ethiopian', 'mother', 'just', 'lost', 'only', 'child', 'son', 'Days', 'Ethiopian', 'Jews', 'camp', '[', 'known', 'Falasha', ']', 'are', 'awaiting', 'be', 'chosen', 'Operation', 'Moses', 'first', 'airlift', 'Ethiopian', 'Jews', 'taken', 'Israel', '1984', 'waiting', 'mother', 'who', 'still', 'grieving', 'lost', 'son', 'Looking', 'Christian', 'mother', 'arrangements', 'grieving', 'Ethiopian', 'Jew', 'mother', 'take', 'young', 'son', 'instead', 'women', 'knowing', 'crime', 'Christian', 'mother', 'determined', 'son', 'pretend', 'be', 'Jewish', 'can', 'escape', 'poverty', 'refugee', 'camp', 'have', 'chance', 'better', 'life', 'Go', 'Live', 'become', 'sad', 'beginning', 'however', 'drama', 'slowly', 'unfolds', 'main', 'character', 'Schlomo', 'eventually', 'adoptive', 'Israeli/French', 'parents', 'eventually', 'adjusts', 'life', 'Jew', 'coping', 'racial', 'bias', 'other', 'challenges', 'while', 'never', 'forgetting', 'mother', 'promise', 'homeland.Maizie', 'Lucille', 'JamesNovember', '16', '2012']",Live and Become

He was adopted into a leftist and non-religious family that loved him unconditionally.  With a strong foundation, he was left to explore and discover his true identity.
