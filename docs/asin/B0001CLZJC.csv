799771,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,B0001CLZJC,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[11, 13]","John Ritter has performed in very few family dramas; although this is a less known work of John, this is also a rare treat for all fans who have loved John Ritter and Meredith Baxter through their respective sitcoms of 1970s/80s. Most of his movies utilized his talents as comedian, but this movie illustrates that John could be a serious actor too. The movie tackles an interesting concept; if a miracle happens, is there a divine intervention or it could be explained rationally. Joe Cass played by John Ritter initially refuses to accept that this is a miracle in spite of the fact he is a dedicated family man, and a preacher of an Episcopal church. His family is less than perfect and his children's are faced with realities of life. Yet he is caring and loves his family and care about community by volunteering as a fireman. During a rescue operation, Joe witnesses a miracle when he tries to save the life a young child trapped in fire. While this miracle not only saves his own life but also brings his family together; his children become responsible and loving and the community comes to regard him as a witness to a real miracle. This is a touching drama of a man who struggles to make it all happen; keep his family together, love his church, and care about the community he lives in, and most importantly deal with the question that did miracle really happen. Meredith Baxter has provided an outstanding performance as his wife Anne who helps him get through the difficult times of the family and also help him understand that miracle did happen. Joanna Garcia (from sitcom Reba) has offered a fine performance as a difficult and out of control daughter, but grows to be a very understanding young woman, and helps her mother emotionally when she is waiting for hospital results to find out if she has bone cancer: Later this turns out to be negative. On the lesser side of the movie, it is interesting for all fans to learn that both John and Meredith attended Hollywood high school at the same time, and both had same birthdays!",5,A Family Drama Starring John Ritter and Meredith Baxter,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,2044,"['John', 'Ritter', 'performed', 'very', 'few', 'family', 'dramas', 'less', 'known', 'work', 'John', 'also', 'rare', 'treat', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'loved', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Meredith', 'Baxter', 'respective', 'sitcoms', '1970s/80s', 'Most', 'movies', 'utilized', 'talents', 'comedian', 'movie', 'John', 'could', 'be', 'serious', 'actor', 'too', 'movie', 'interesting', 'concept', 'miracle', 'happens', 'there', 'divine', 'intervention', 'could', 'be', 'explained', 'rationally', 'Joe', 'Cass', 'played', 'John', 'Ritter', 'initially', 'accept', 'miracle', 'spite', 'fact', 'dedicated', 'family', 'man', 'preacher', 'Episcopal', 'church', 'family', 'less', 'perfect', 'children', 'are', 'faced', 'realities', 'life', 'caring', 'family', 'care', 'community', 'volunteering', 'fireman', 'rescue', 'operation', 'Joe', 'miracle', 'when', 'save', 'life', 'young', 'child', 'trapped', 'fire', 'miracle', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'life', 'also', 'family', 'together', 'children', 'become', 'responsible', 'loving', 'community', 'regard', 'witness', 'real', 'miracle', 'touching', 'drama', 'man', 'who', 'make', 'happen', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'love', 'church', 'care', 'community', 'most', 'importantly', 'deal', 'question', 'did', 'miracle', 'really', 'happen', 'Meredith', 'Baxter', 'provided', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'wife', 'Anne', 'who', 'get', 'difficult', 'times', 'family', 'also', 'help', 'understand', 'miracle', 'did', 'happen', 'Joanna', 'Garcia', 'sitcom', 'Reba', 'offered', 'fine', 'performance', 'difficult', 'control', 'daughter', 'be', 'very', 'understanding', 'young', 'woman', 'mother', 'emotionally', 'when', 'waiting', 'hospital', 'results', 'find', 'out', 'bone', 'cancer', 'Later', 'out', 'be', 'negative', 'lesser', 'side', 'movie', 'interesting', 'fans', 'learn', 'John', 'Meredith', 'attended', 'Hollywood', 'high', 'school', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'same', 'birthdays']",Man of Miracles
799772,A18UBPBIKPQMPE,B0001CLZJC,"Suppresst ""suppresst""","[4, 5]","John Ritter and Meredith Baxter do an outstanding job of portraying ordinary Americans grappling with an issue that most in Hollywood refuse to treat, and pretend doesn't exist - religious faith. Ritter plays the part of an Episcopal priest serving a flagging congregation and grappling with serious, though ubiquitous, family issues, such as teen rebellion. Ritter is also stuggling with his own faith, asking his wife (Meredith Baxter) at one point ""Did you ever think life would work out the way it has?""Serving also as a volunteer fireman, Ritter observes what could be interpreted as a miracle. Accepting it as a miracle has the potentional to revolutionize his life, and the life of the community in which he lives, but his faculty of reason remains an obstacle.Have you, the reader, ever experienced what could be the hand of God in your life, and struggled to decide how to interpret that experience? Does God exist? Does he care? Are miracles still possible in this age of reason.Most Americans grapple with issues of religious faith, and movies like this ought to be commonplace in theatres today, for they reflect on that reality.
