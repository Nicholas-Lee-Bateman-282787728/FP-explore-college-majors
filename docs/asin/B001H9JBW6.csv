I actually thought it was stand alone DVD, not a multi-disc miniseries.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it went on for multiple episodes.  By the end of the first episode I was hooked.Without giving any details away, the gist of the main storyline is that entities in the government in Great Britain are working to implement T.I.A. (Total Information Access), a network of data feeds that includes banks, stores, transportation systems, surveillance cameras, and any data source that requires the use of an ID card, bank card, etc.  This is being done to increase statewide security against the possibility of terrorist activities, etc.  Of course, this kind of total info access can be used for all kinds of agendas......enter our main character, a world renowned Mathematician who has been out of country for several years, living more or less in isolation, to attend a funeral.  When he gets home he discovers that there have been MANY changes in his absence. And so the story begins.As the story progresses you won't know which way to turn, who is on whose side, and what everyone is after.  This is top-flight made-for-TV drama and suspense.I have to admit that I did not care personally for some of the interpersonal situations that were presented from time to time, though one did add to the storyline.This is a not too futuristic version of Big Brother is Watching.  The acting is strong, and the story line is engaging.All in all, I'd say this is a very good offering, I can recommend it, with just a a few personal reservations.4 stars.",4,BBC knows how to do things right...excellent mini-series,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,1632,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'Last', 'Enemy', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'stand', 'alone', 'DVD', 'not', 'multi-disc', 'miniseries', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'glad', 'went', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked.Without', 'giving', 'details', 'away', 'gist', 'main', 'storyline', 'entities', 'government', 'Great', 'Britain', 'are', 'working', 'implement', 'T.I.A', 'Total', 'Information', 'Access', 'network', 'data', 'feeds', 'banks', 'stores', 'transportation', 'systems', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'data', 'source', 'use', 'ID', 'card', 'bank', 'card', 'etc', 'being', 'done', 'increase', 'statewide', 'security', 'possibility', 'terrorist', 'activities', 'etc', 'course', 'kind', 'total', 'info', 'access', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'kinds', 'agendas', 'enter', 'main', 'character', 'world', 'renowned', 'Mathematician', 'who', 'been', 'country', 'several', 'years', 'living', 'more', 'less', 'isolation', 'attend', 'funeral', 'When', 'home', 'have', 'been', 'MANY', 'changes', 'absence', 'so', 'story', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'turn', 'who', 'side', 'what', 'everyone', 'top-flight', 'made-for-TV', 'drama', 'suspense.I', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'personally', 'interpersonal', 'situations', 'were', 'presented', 'time', 'time', 'one', 'did', 'add', 'storyline.This', 'not', 'too', 'futuristic', 'version', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Watching', 'acting', 'strong', 'story', 'line', 'engaging.All', ""'d"", 'say', 'very', 'good', 'offering', 'can', 'recommend', 'just', 'few', 'personal', 'reservations.4', 'stars']",The Last Enemy

1199590,A2RIRJJPGPMM8N,B001H9JBW6,Everyone's_a_critic,"[8, 8]","I liked this mini-series. I wandered in looking for more of Benedict Cumberbatch's work after seeing his great performance in ""Sherlock"" (which I give 5 stars). This multi-episode story held my attention throughout, and Cumberbatch played well a genius astounded at what was unfolding around him. You can't look away from the screen though because they don't dumb it down for you. One must pay attention. Yes, there are definitely some holes in the fabric the filmmakers weave, as well as some thin spots you could easily rip wide open... but I am going thumbs up on the drama as a whole. I cared about the characters and what their ultimate fate would be.Of far more importance however then the drama itself is the obtuse message delivered by the producers. We are on the verge of losing what remains of our personal liberty. The England painted by the film makers is not some maybe, kind of, far off 'Mad Max' could-be dystopian future. It is more of a 'Max Headroom' world that is looming up all around us. The world of The Last Enemy is just around the corner. In fact, we are at least half way around that corner. Much of the technology used in the film appears to be here already (and micro-biologists ARE dying at an unusually high rate).Many well-intended people in government --such as portrayed in 'The Last Enemy""-- think strong controls on the populace is a logical means of preventing terrorism and related crimes. History does not bear that philosophy out however. You can't gain freedom by removing freedom. Given the current state of the evolution of human consciousness, powers given to the Government are at first used with [hopefully] good intent. Then they are mis-used. Then they are ab-used. Every single time. Treatments such as 'The Last Enemy' help point out the futility of 1984 style controls placed on a society. Our best way out of the dilemma the world faces is instead through individual citizens raising their own consciousness. We MUST evolve or freedom [which world history shows to be a temporary state] will die.btw - A title I can think of that might interest those who liked this film is the British political mini-series 'The Amazing Mrs Pritchard'. And those wanting to learn more regarding the themes presented in 'The Last Enemy' have an abundance of choices in video. Two that come to mind are the black dystopian comedy from Terry Gilliam 'Brazil', and the documentary 'Ayn Rand & the Philosophy of Atlas Shrugged'.",4,We have met the last enemy... and he is us,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,2459,"['liked', 'mini-series', 'wandered', 'looking', 'more', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'work', 'seeing', 'great', 'performance', 'Sherlock', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'multi-episode', 'story', 'held', 'attention', 'Cumberbatch', 'played', 'well', 'genius', 'astounded', 'what', 'was', 'unfolding', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'down', 'must', 'pay', 'attention', 'Yes', 'are', 'definitely', 'holes', 'fabric', 'filmmakers', 'weave', 'as', 'well', 'thin', 'spots', 'could', 'easily', 'rip', 'wide', 'open', 'am', 'going', 'thumbs', 'up', 'drama', 'whole', 'cared', 'characters', 'what', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'would', 'be.Of', 'far', 'more', 'importance', 'however', 'then', 'drama', 'obtuse', 'message', 'delivered', 'producers', 'are', 'verge', 'losing', 'what', 'personal', 'liberty', 'England', 'painted', 'film', 'makers', 'not', 'maybe', 'kind', 'far', ""'Mad"", 'Max', 'could-be', 'dystopian', 'future', 'more', ""'Max"", 'Headroom', 'world', 'looming', 'up', 'world', 'Last', 'Enemy', 'just', 'corner', 'fact', 'are', 'least', 'half', 'way', 'corner', 'Much', 'technology', 'used', 'film', 'be', 'here', 'already', 'micro-biologists', 'ARE', 'dying', 'unusually', 'high', 'rate', 'well-intended', 'people', 'government', 'such', 'portrayed', ""'The"", 'Last', 'Enemy', 'think', 'strong', 'controls', 'populace', 'logical', 'means', 'preventing', 'terrorism', 'related', 'crimes', 'History', 'not', 'bear', 'philosophy', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'gain', 'freedom', 'removing', 'freedom', 'Given', 'current', 'state', 'evolution', 'human', 'consciousness', 'powers', 'given', 'Government', 'are', 'first', 'used', '[', 'hopefully', ']', 'good', 'intent', 'Then', 'are', 'mis-used', 'Then', 'are', 'ab-used', 'single', 'time', 'Treatments', 'such', ""'The"", 'Last', 'Enemy', 'help', 'point', 'out', 'futility', '1984', 'style', 'controls', 'placed', 'society', 'best', 'way', 'dilemma', 'world', 'instead', 'individual', 'citizens', 'raising', 'own', 'consciousness', 'MUST', 'evolve', 'freedom', '[', 'world', 'history', 'shows', 'be', 'temporary', 'state', ']', 'will', 'die.btw', 'title', 'can', 'think', 'might', 'interest', 'who', 'liked', 'film', 'British', 'political', 'mini-series', 'Amazing', 'Mrs', 'Pritchard', 'wanting', 'learn', 'more', 'regarding', 'themes', 'presented', ""'The"", 'Last', 'Enemy', 'have', 'abundance', 'choices', 'video', 'Two', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'black', 'dystopian', 'comedy', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', ""'Brazil"", 'documentary', ""'Ayn"", 'Rand', 'Philosophy', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged']",The Last Enemy
1199591,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B001H9JBW6,FYI,"[2, 3]","From the moment this precient narrative begins, viewers are transported to another world, in the not too distant future. The whole ensemble cast, from Benedict Cumberbatch, to Anamaria Marinca and Robert Carlyle, make this dark futuristic tale by Peter Berry more believable. Cumberbatch is superb as Stephen Ezard, a research scientist just returning to London from China to attend his brother Michael's funeral. After all his years away, he is bewildered by an England he does not recognize; London has become a police-state. Unlike his late-brother, Stephen Ezard is a recluse who abhors germs and personal contact. Despite his walls, he's drawn to his brother's complex widow, Yasim (Anamaria Marinca delivers a finely nuanced tough/gentle performance), a medical doctor. They become embroiled in a swirl of conspiracies while he works on the government's super-database. Ezard's struggle to survive is a superb character study enriched by a marvelous performance by Cumberbatch. Robert Caryle is perfect as a menacing rogue government agent - quite convincing. Despite the subject matter, this isn't a political left/right film or story. As one outsider-character states, people have the right to be anonymous.

Just some yellow-green grass that looks like it would rather be someplace else. It's the Killi Faizo medical refugee camp, a gathering of white tents arranged in rows in the middle of nowhere. A Britisher gets into his Land Rover and drives out of the camp. Over the next hill, a man releases a hawk. A special hawk, this one is carrying a miniature video camera.Cut to London, where a woman is awakened from her sleep by a phone call. It is a video. The man in the Land Rover is blown to bits as his vehicle hits a land mine.An interesting and mysterious beginning to ""The Last Enemy"". Mysterious because you don't know how the man with the hawk knew that the Land Rover was going to hit a land mine.Stephen Ezard travels back to England for the funeral of the man in the Land Rover, who was his brother Michael. Stephen is a mildly-misanthropic mathematical genius. He's been holed up in China, not communicating with the outside world. London today has some surprises for him. Due to terrorist attacks, a lot has changed. Retinal scans in the airport. Identity cards. Police in body armor patrol London in bands of five. Camera monitors on every street corner, in every store, even in the houses.A limo picks Stephen up at the airport and he asks the driver to go faster because he's late for the funeral.The driver replies, ""Oh, I'm afraid we don't have clearance to break monitored speed, Sir.""""Monitored speed?  I've been away, about 4 years.""""You'll be noticing the changes then, Sir.""At Michael's apartment, Stephen has more surprises.1) There's a sick woman with an IV in the bedroom2) Michael had a wife, Yasim, a doctor who met Michael in refugee camp""The Last Enemy"", in an original script by Peter Barry, at first seems just a cautionary tale about giving up your rights to the state in return, you hope, for protection against terrorism. Where do you draw the line?  For England in this series, the line may be the passage or not passage of T.I.A.  Total Information Awareness, according to the developers, is ""the entire U.K. in one database, birth to death, day to day, up to date and in real time. ... Absolute surveillance.""But there is more than that going on. Why does Yasim hide the sick woman's body when she dies? Why are murders following Yasim and Stephen? What happens when the powers that be want to test an ultimate weapon, any way they can?There is a reason why the tagline for this mini-series is""Tomorrow Is Nearer Than You Think...""You don't find out where the title, ""The Last Enemy"", comes from until almost the very last words spoken. It reminded me of when, many years ago, I read George Orwell's ""1984"", immediately followed by reading Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"". I ended up liking ""Fahrenheit 451"" better, because at the end, you were given hope. Unlike the ending of ""1984"", Bradbury lets you believe that there is a chance the world could change.

1199594,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B001H9JBW6,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[15, 24]","A series that is a prodigiously well-knit plot, so well-knit that we can wonder what the truth is in the end. It is a lot more than just a rewriting of Big Brother with all the cameras everywhere and the tracking chips in the shoes, belts, or even under the skin. All that is covered up by the imposed ID card which is supposed to concentrate opposition while the necessary software are tested to identify the eyes, the finger prints, the figure and who knows what else of every single person. The new generation of trackers are infinitesimally small molecules injected or simply incorporated in the body of a person even be it only via a drink and then the person is tagged for life, and even beyond. The series here shows how an experiment went wrong, not really wrong but actually came out dirty. A set of these tags were injected to thousands of refugees in Afghanistan in some kind of innocuous medical injection, and that tag had the capacity to recognize the genes of the person and then to kill one particular human family, Arabs in that case. The film on such a point is badly informed since in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan the people are of Indo-European stock and not Semitic, and wrong again if you wonder how such a tracker can make the difference between a Jewish Semite and an Arab Semite? But never mind such details. They were testing a genetic weapon that could annihilate a whole population in a few days, in other words an illegal genocidal genetic weapon. They even doubled up the demonstration by making the only British citizen who got the tag recover within twenty-four hours. So Big Brother is becoming there Big Western War Criminal. And the West wonders then where these middle-easterners and far-easterners find their terrorist ideas. In our security laboratories, and no where else. But the series has another interest. It shows the inside picture of that kind of security experimentation and we find out that there are at least four or five levels and that most people have one foot in more than one level and often in three levels. The last scene is typical. Michael, the NGO worker who was the ultimate guinea pig of the tag is executed on the ship that is leaving Britain by the man who helped all along Michael, his Brother Stephen and his wife Yasim, and we discover that he who appeared to be a freelance fighter to avenge his own daughter is in fact a multiple agent working for the secret and totally undercover circle of the security services of the government. That gives to the series an interesting twinge. Note that tag was also used against illegal immigrant who were infected in a way or another and died within days. Actually the doctor of this experiment manages to find a cure but he is eliminated in due time and all evidence destroyed. The experiment had been a full success. Let's keep that in reserve. The final element is the sentimental level. Michael is officially killed and buried and Stephen comes back from China for the funeral. Yasim, Michael's wife is then ripped between the dead husband and his brother, and the brother is divided between his brother's wife and his brother's widow. One of the side effects of that false death and burial is that Stephen is brought back to England and then will no longer be able to leave, hence will be forced to work for the government. So even the wife torn between two brothers is not really dramatic, certainly not tragic. It is one more level of political plotting. But altogether the series is interesting and even fascinating, British in one word in that genre of political science fiction.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,More brilliant than that is difficult,1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,3731,"['series', 'prodigiously', 'well-knit', 'plot', 'so', 'well-knit', 'can', 'wonder', 'what', 'truth', 'end', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'rewriting', 'Big', 'Brother', 'cameras', 'everywhere', 'tracking', 'chips', 'shoes', 'belts', 'even', 'skin', 'covered', 'up', 'imposed', 'ID', 'card', 'supposed', 'concentrate', 'opposition', 'necessary', 'software', 'are', 'tested', 'identify', 'eyes', 'finger', 'prints', 'figure', 'who', 'what', 'else', 'single', 'person', 'new', 'generation', 'trackers', 'are', 'infinitesimally', 'small', 'molecules', 'injected', 'simply', 'incorporated', 'body', 'person', 'even', 'be', 'only', 'drink', 'then', 'person', 'tagged', 'life', 'even', 'series', 'here', 'how', 'experiment', 'went', 'wrong', 'not', 'really', 'wrong', 'actually', 'came', 'out', 'dirty', 'set', 'tags', 'were', 'injected', 'thousands', 'refugees', 'Afghanistan', 'kind', 'innocuous', 'medical', 'injection', 'tag', 'had', 'capacity', 'recognize', 'genes', 'person', 'then', 'kill', 'one', 'particular', 'human', 'family', 'Arabs', 'case', 'film', 'point', 'badly', 'informed', 'Afghanistan', 'Iran', 'Pakistan', 'people', 'are', 'Indo-European', 'stock', 'not', 'Semitic', 'wrong', 'again', 'wonder', 'how', 'such', 'tracker', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'Jewish', 'Semite', 'Arab', 'Semite', 'never', 'mind', 'such', 'details', 'were', 'testing', 'genetic', 'weapon', 'could', 'annihilate', 'whole', 'population', 'few', 'days', 'other', 'words', 'illegal', 'genocidal', 'genetic', 'weapon', 'even', 'doubled', 'up', 'demonstration', 'making', 'only', 'British', 'citizen', 'who', 'got', 'tag', 'recover', 'twenty-four', 'hours', 'So', 'Big', 'Brother', 'becoming', 'there', 'Big', 'Western', 'War', 'Criminal', 'West', 'wonders', 'then', 'where', 'middle-easterners', 'far-easterners', 'find', 'terrorist', 'ideas', 'security', 'laboratories', 'where', 'else', 'series', 'interest', 'inside', 'picture', 'kind', 'security', 'experimentation', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'least', 'four', 'five', 'levels', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'one', 'foot', 'more', 'one', 'level', 'often', 'three', 'levels', 'last', 'scene', 'typical', 'Michael', 'NGO', 'worker', 'who', 'was', 'ultimate', 'guinea', 'pig', 'tag', 'executed', 'ship', 'leaving', 'Britain', 'man', 'who', 'helped', 'Michael', 'Brother', 'Stephen', 'wife', 'Yasim', 'discover', 'who', 'appeared', 'be', 'freelance', 'fighter', 'avenge', 'own', 'daughter', 'fact', 'multiple', 'agent', 'working', 'secret', 'totally', 'undercover', 'circle', 'security', 'services', 'government', 'series', 'interesting', 'twinge', 'Note', 'tag', 'was', 'also', 'used', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'who', 'were', 'infected', 'way', 'died', 'days', 'Actually', 'doctor', 'experiment', 'find', 'cure', 'eliminated', 'due', 'time', 'evidence', 'destroyed', 'experiment', 'had', 'been', 'full', 'success', 'Let', 'keep', 'reserve', 'final', 'element', 'sentimental', 'level', 'Michael', 'officially', 'killed', 'buried', 'Stephen', 'back', 'China', 'funeral', 'Yasim', 'Michael', 'wife', 'then', 'ripped', 'dead', 'husband', 'brother', 'brother', 'divided', 'brother', 'wife', 'brother', 'widow', 'One', 'side', 'effects', 'false', 'death', 'burial', 'Stephen', 'brought', 'back', 'England', 'then', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'able', 'leave', 'hence', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'work', 'government', 'So', 'even', 'wife', 'torn', 'two', 'brothers', 'not', 'really', 'dramatic', 'certainly', 'not', 'tragic', 'one', 'more', 'level', 'political', 'plotting', 'altogether', 'series', 'interesting', 'even', 'fascinating', 'British', 'one', 'word', 'genre', 'political', 'science', 'fiction.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",The Last Enemy
1199595,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B001H9JBW6,Kevin Killian,"[32, 43]","My wife's infatuation with Benedict Cumberbatch continues unabated, so I was invited to watch five hours of this nonsense with her and, well, it was that or divorce, what would you do?  While it was going on she admitted that even Cumberbatch, the single greatest man who ever lived in all of history she thinks, was finding it heavy going breathing life into this story which we had both seen, like, one million times.  Anyone who has watched Tom Cruise in a futuristic movie has seen it, and seen it done much better.  I hereby give Tom Cruise a Bell Curve Oscar for his sterling work in Oblivion, Vanilla Sky, War of the Worlds, etc.  Lifetime Achievement Award, and it will be presented live on TV to him by Rosie O'Donnell and a deflated Benedict Cumberbatch.The story is ridiculously expanded to pad out two hours to five.  My questions include, Who are those evil foreign brothers from Russia or wherever?  Who is Robert Carlyle playing and how does he know so much, and yet so little, about every twist and turn of the plot?  Is every government employee in England satanically evil?  If you were a woman passionately devoted to your husband, and he died, and his brother showed up the day of his funeral, a brother you had never met and moreover looks nothing like your husband--we were 100 per cent sure it would turn out that he actually was the husband, with a facelift and his memory shifted as in Total Recall or Source Code--would you skip the funeral and have sex with this stranger instead?  While a plague stricken woman lies dying in the next room, a woman you are sworn to help?  (This is no spoiler as it occurs within the first 25 minutes of the miniseries.)  My wife murmured, ""Benedict Cumberbatch couldn't help himself, but that woman Kasim is a slut.""  Later she apologizes by explaining that, ""He was there.... And I wanted him,"" a sentiment my wife sympathized with.  OK, more questions, Carrie's boss in Homeland, David Estes, shows up in this effort playing the exact same part, only here he's British.  Does he play no other sort of role?  It is the sort of part Rod Steiger and then John Malkovich used to excel in, cold as ice and pure and icy ambition.Then there's the Robert Carlyle question.  It seems like only yesterday he used to be a great star, in The Full Monty and Trainspotting and others.  Surprised to see him still alive, and unable to follow a single word of his dialogue due to my accent recognition software malfunctioning, I spent a lot of time looking him up simultaneously on IMDB and finding out that in fact he's been busy acting in thirty-two movies I have never heard of, sometimes playing characters such as ""Third Man in Tavern"" or ""Chauffeur.""  I guess he saw he had a lead part in a miniseries and jumped in with both feet, but the cruel producers here made him leave off his lifts, so he tries his best to menace and murder and hold hostage, but it's cute because he's no more than five feet three I would estimate.  It's like watching little Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense as a supervillain, in punky clothes borrowed from, oh I don't know, Punky Brewster.Final question, have you ever seen a tacked-on ending before?  Of course you have, but this one will leave you with your head in your hands, mumbling and pouting, one thought ratcheting through your brain, that soon, very soon, your wife is going to be forcing you to see Benedict Cumberbatch in the forthcoming biopic of Julian Assange (!!!) and she'll be whispering in your ear, ""Oh be a sport, at least it will be better than The Last Enemy.""",3,How to Save a Marriage,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,3572,"['wife', 'infatuation', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'unabated', 'was', 'invited', 'watch', 'five', 'hours', 'nonsense', 'well', 'was', 'divorce', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'was', 'going', 'admitted', 'even', 'Cumberbatch', 'single', 'greatest', 'man', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'history', 'was', 'finding', 'heavy', 'going', 'breathing', 'life', 'story', 'had', 'seen', 'one', 'million', 'times', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'futuristic', 'movie', 'seen', 'seen', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'hereby', 'give', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Bell', 'Curve', 'Oscar', 'sterling', 'work', 'Oblivion', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'War', 'Worlds', 'etc', 'Lifetime', 'Achievement', 'Award', 'will', 'be', 'presented', 'live', 'TV', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'deflated', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch.The', 'story', 'ridiculously', 'expanded', 'pad', 'out', 'two', 'hours', 'five', 'questions', 'include', 'Who', 'are', 'evil', 'foreign', 'brothers', 'Russia', 'wherever', 'Who', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'playing', 'how', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'yet', 'so', 'little', 'about', 'twist', 'turn', 'plot', 'government', 'employee', 'England', 'satanically', 'evil', 'were', 'woman', 'passionately', 'devoted', 'husband', 'died', 'brother', 'showed', 'up', 'day', 'funeral', 'brother', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'nothing', 'husband', 'were', '100', 'cent', 'sure', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'actually', 'was', 'husband', 'facelift', 'memory', 'shifted', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Source', 'Code', 'would', 'skip', 'funeral', 'have', 'sex', 'stranger', 'instead', 'plague', 'stricken', 'woman', 'dying', 'next', 'room', 'woman', 'are', 'sworn', 'help', 'spoiler', 'first', '25', 'minutes', 'miniseries', 'wife', 'murmured', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'woman', 'Kasim', 'slut', 'Later', 'explaining', 'was', 'there', 'wanted', 'sentiment', 'wife', 'sympathized', 'OK', 'more', 'questions', 'Carrie', 'boss', 'Homeland', 'David', 'Estes', 'up', 'effort', 'playing', 'exact', 'same', 'part', 'only', 'here', 'British', 'play', 'other', 'sort', 'role', 'sort', 'part', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'then', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'used', 'excel', 'cold', 'ice', 'pure', 'icy', 'ambition.Then', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'question', 'only', 'yesterday', 'used', 'be', 'great', 'star', 'Full', 'Monty', 'Trainspotting', 'others', 'Surprised', 'see', 'still', 'alive', 'unable', 'follow', 'single', 'word', 'dialogue', 'due', 'accent', 'recognition', 'software', 'malfunctioning', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'looking', 'up', 'simultaneously', 'IMDB', 'finding', 'out', 'fact', 'been', 'busy', 'acting', 'thirty-two', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'sometimes', 'playing', 'characters', 'such', 'Third', 'Man', 'Tavern', 'Chauffeur', 'guess', 'saw', 'had', 'lead', 'part', 'miniseries', 'jumped', 'feet', 'cruel', 'producers', 'here', 'made', 'leave', 'off', 'lifts', 'best', 'menace', 'murder', 'hold', 'hostage', 'cute', 'more', 'five', 'feet', 'three', 'would', 'estimate', 'watching', 'little', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'supervillain', 'punky', 'clothes', 'borrowed', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Punky', 'Brewster.Final', 'question', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'tacked-on', 'ending', 'course', 'have', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'head', 'hands', 'mumbling', 'pouting', 'one', 'thought', 'ratcheting', 'brain', 'soon', 'very', 'soon', 'wife', 'going', 'be', 'forcing', 'see', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'forthcoming', 'biopic', 'Julian', 'Assange', ""'ll"", 'be', 'whispering', 'ear', 'Oh', 'be', 'sport', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'Last', 'Enemy']",The Last Enemy

Some of the characters are not really true to themselves either.  The acting is not the issue here is it the storytelling and editing that makes me say that this series is only &#34;okay&#34;.  I really didn't come away from this with any real sense of the true story that it was trying to tell.  Is it about big government's attempt at total control of all it's citizens whereabouts at any given time or is it about a type of ethnic cleansing through targeted vaccines?  A father's revenge?  Truly, I do not know.  Once again, it is not the acting as everyone is very, very good, but in the end it left me lacking.

1199604,A1PPD5TOR6VVYV,B001H9JBW6,S Smyth,"[0, 0]","I missed almost all of this series when it was originally aired in 2008. Yet, of the little that I did see of it, I remembered the scene where Steven Ezard (Cumberbatch) is being interrogated by David Russell (Carlyle) in front of Russell's electric fence, and that the main character was a professor who had worked in China. With this scant amount of information, 5-years later, I was able to, Steven-Ezard-like, cyber-track down the title of the series via Google, and then purchase it on Amazon.This is a very well produced drama which seeks to integrate the qualities of prior art such as Smiley's People and Reilly, Ace of Spies, with a more contemporary editing style, like that of its US counterparts. 24, for example. My impression, on a first viewing of the DVDs, suggested an overly elaborate story line that depended on the heavy use, if not heavy-handed use, of foreshadowing and allusion, to maintain the viewer's interest. Nevertheless, like Roman Polanski's Ghost (The Ghost Writer), the series contains an engaging amount of pathos and inner detail which more than mitigates the issue.The acting was consistently excellent. Especially from, yet not limited to, Benedict Cumberbatch, Anamaria Marinca (irrespective of a line of tricksy dialogue) and Max Beesley. The rich tone of the images seems to have benefited from being shot on film.After becoming acquainted with the intricacies of the story for this series, the DVDs give one the opportunity to gain a much better impression of its strengths.
