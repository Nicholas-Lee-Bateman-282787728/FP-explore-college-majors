1182975,AE0337VVP8MRM,B001DR9NB6,E. Borgman,"[70, 70]","Harvey Korman introduced Tim Conway as, ""the funniest man alive!"" and I think that just might be the case! I just finished watching this gem of a video. Although Louise DuArt is good, the best thing about this video is Conway and Korman. They still had comedic chemistry on stage and both appeared to be trying to out ad-lib the other! I am terribly sad that I missed seeing these two live, but seeing them preserved on this film is the next best thing. As I am a filmmaker, of a sort, myself, I would give anything to have the likes of Tim Conway in a film of mine. He still has it! The video ends with The Dentist Sketch which has been updated a little since the television version, but it is still a real laugh getter! To my surprise, the Special Feature section contained a commentary track! Not only that but we can see the two of them in the corner commenting on the show. But get this, this is the great part, the commentary is just as funny as the show! So it's like getting three hours of great comedy for the price of a 90 minute video! I know I'm gushing a little here, but I'm just very happy with the product. Tim Conway even mentioned that, like me, Laurel and Hardy were two of his influences! One last thing I think that this is a pretty clean video and would be appropriate for a younger audience as well.

Ash ""fuzzydude""","[16, 16]","I saw Tim Conway and Harvey Korman perform live and this DVD is pretty much how I remember the show - Tim & Harvey are fantastic, Louise DuArt slows things down. The reason to get this DVD is for the performances by Conway and Korman. Seeing them work together is always a treat as they obviously love what they're doing and have such a wonderful rapport with each other - and it's fun to see how long it will take Harvey to start laughing. Their commentary on the show is also fun to listen to (and watch since it's a video commentary as well).As for DuArt,I know some people like her, but her sense of humor just doesn't match mine. I also don't like it when people doing impressions have to tell you who they're imitating. But enough of that. If you're a fan of Conway & Korman, I think you'll enjoy this DVD.",4,Conway & Korman are fantastic!,1309478400,"07 1, 2011",2011,812,"['saw', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'perform', 'live', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'remember', 'show', 'Tim', 'Harvey', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Louise', 'DuArt', 'things', 'down', 'reason', 'get', 'DVD', 'performances', 'Conway', 'Korman', 'Seeing', 'work', 'together', 'always', 'treat', 'obviously', 'love', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'have', 'wonderful', 'rapport', 'other', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'take', 'Harvey', 'start', 'laughing', 'commentary', 'show', 'also', 'fun', 'listen', 'watch', 'video', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', '.As', 'DuArt', 'know', 'people', 'sense', 'humor', 'just', ""n't"", 'match', 'mine', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'people', 'doing', 'impressions', 'have', 'tell', 'who', ""'re"", 'imitating', 'enough', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Conway', 'Korman', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'DVD']",Tim Conway Harvey Korman Together Again DVD
