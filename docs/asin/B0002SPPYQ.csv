The concluding Saturday of every SXSW festival has a free concert lakeside in downtown Austin. This year the headliners were Los Lonely boys from nearby San Angelo, Texas.I actually had no idea they had national renown until I turned on the Latin Grammy's and saw them with Santana. This has most of their songs from the debut album and some excellent muscianship. Fans of the album will not be disappointed at all.I especially like Hollywood, Nobody Else, and Heaven is great. There are a number of extended guitar solos, drumming, jamming, and a few drum solos. Even some harmonica and gazoo playing.The extras are nice if not that long. The best by far is the look at their hometown of San Angelo and going back to their old schools and homes. Anyone who likes their music will be pleased to have this in their collection. And unlike movie videos this can be viewed and enjoyed over and over and over with no lose of enjoyment. Those of you elsewhere go and see them if you get a chance. I was out of town for this concert so it is nice that I get to see what I missed that night.",5,SXSW free show captured plus extras: Equal a good fun time,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,1135,"['South', 'SW', 'annual', 'happening', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'concluding', 'Saturday', 'SXSW', 'festival', 'free', 'concert', 'lakeside', 'downtown', 'Austin', 'year', 'headliners', 'were', 'Los', 'Lonely', 'nearby', 'San', 'Angelo', 'Texas.I', 'actually', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'national', 'renown', 'turned', 'Latin', 'Grammy', 'saw', 'Santana', 'most', 'songs', 'debut', 'album', 'excellent', 'muscianship', 'Fans', 'album', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'all.I', 'especially', 'like', 'Hollywood', 'Nobody', 'Else', 'Heaven', 'great', 'are', 'number', 'extended', 'guitar', 'solos', 'drumming', 'jamming', 'few', 'drum', 'solos', 'Even', 'harmonica', 'gazoo', 'playing.The', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'not', 'long', 'best', 'far', 'look', 'hometown', 'San', 'Angelo', 'going', 'back', 'old', 'schools', 'homes', 'Anyone', 'who', 'music', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'have', 'collection', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'enjoyed', 'lose', 'enjoyment', 'elsewhere', 'go', 'see', 'get', 'chance', 'was', 'town', 'concert', 'nice', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'missed', 'night']",Los Lonely Boys - Texican Style

But as great as that album is, this is where LLB does their best: in front of their loyal and rapid Loopies and Lonlies. Here, we find the boys playing in front of 25,000 people in their musical hometown, Austin, Texas, during the SXSW festival. They play a great set, and are full of energy. Even on the slower songs, it makes you nod your head. This shows that they are truly one of the best bands to come out in the new millenium. Also, the bonus features are really hilarious and interesting. From Henry's Sean Connery impression to Ringo's meeting of his third-grade teacher, they continue to entertain, even without the instruments.

844735,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B0002SPPYQ,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[0, 0]","This is a fantastic concert by Grammy Award winning, Los Lonely Boys. This is a band of brothers: Henry Garza, Jojo Garza, & Ringo Garza. This concert was filmed live at Auditorium Shores, Austin, Texas, U.S.A., on March 20, 2004. It has an approximate running time of 96 minutes.Henry Garza, the lead electric,guitar player must have been influenced by the late/great Stevie Ray Vaughan. This guitar playing style sounds kinda like Stevie Ray, plus, he performs ""tricks"" with his guitar, like Stevie Ray did, like playing it behind his back. Plus, he and one of his brothers, Jo Jo, both play the guitar together like Stevie Ray & his brother Jimmy Vaughan did. Jo Jo sings most, but not all of the lead vocals.Overall, you get Henry on lead electric guitar,  another brother, Jo Jo on electric bass guitar, (and he has some ""tricks"" of his own with his bass guitar, he sings most of the vocals), and then you get the other brother, Ringo on drums. So, you get a ""Power Trio"". These guys play their hearts out!!!There are times when they just improvise, and jam on and on, spontaneously. The crowd loves it!!!!Also, the packed crowd is really, really into this one. These guys played on the last day of the New Orleans Jazz Fest back in 2005, but I missed their performance.However, this concert dvd certainly makes up for it. This concert is totally ""awesome"", just look at all the 5 stars ratings they have recreived.The song set:1.Intro of the Los Lonely Boys2.Crazy Dream3.Dime Mi Amor4.Nobody Else5.Velvet Sky6.Man to Beat7.Onda8.Supper Time9.Hollywood10.Real Emotions11.Senorita12.Heaven (This was their biggest hit, Henry sings this one, their live performace of it, is totally awesome, it sounds like the studio version, & the version that was played extensively on CMT, back when it was a hit, and in this live concert, it sounds even better, you get an extended version of it. Henry's electric guitar playing is phenonmenal.)Encore Performance: (The Crowd just won't let them leave.)13.An Outstanding Extended Instrumental, with all kinds of guitar ""tricks"", bass guitar ""tricks"", spontaneous improvisions, Henry plays the guitar behind his back, like the late/great Stevie Ray did. It's totally awesome!!!! Words just don't do it justice.Bonus Material: Behind the Scences & Documentaries.This is a Great One, and I highly recommend it.

This is a fine performance in front of a home crowd featuring three talented brothers calling themselves Los Lonely Boys.  Not a weak tune in the bunch, this is a nice set of varied music ranging from hard Texas blues to Mexican rockers to playful ditties spanning about 90 minutes or so.  Oh, and ya, the pop-blues rocker ""Heaven"" is included.  While there is really no standout solo vocalist, the Garza brothers blend their Texas and Mexican heritage in fine order and offer up some great harmonies in the process.  Comparisons to SRV are not surprising as Henry has clearly spent more then a few hours with an SRV CD or two.  However, unlike myriad of SRV wannabes out there, Henry is a talented guitar player with a style and tone all his own.  All three brothers are fine musicians and play off each other as if they have been playing together their whole life ;-)  Excellent sound and picture quality.Since SRVs premature passing, Texas blues has been in wanting of some new blood.

844740,A3V9QMIL483A16,B0002SPPYQ,really2k1,"[3, 3]","I was introduced to LLB by a family member who knew I played some guitar. They actually bought me this DVD before I'd even heard of them - knowing that I'd like it.  I watched this DVD and was blown away. These guys are first and foremost great musicians and almost as importantly...they are great entertainers.  Since then, I've bought their debut album, Live at the Fillmore and Sacred. I also saw them live in the summer 2005. That summer, I saw the Eagles, Eric Clapton and LLB...the first three real concerts I'd ever been to.  Me and my wife say hands down that LLB was by far the best concert of the three.  These guys get the crowd going with their musicianship, honesty and energy.  They don't rely on who they are, they are there to play great music and to entertain and they seem to have a lot of fun doing it.This DVD captures their live show pretty well. It's pretty much the same set that they played when I saw them.  It's amazing how ""full"" they sound with only three guys. Crazy Dream is an attention-getting intro. Of course Heaven is in there. Watch these guys bring down the house as they end the show with End of a New Beginning...this set rocks.  If you have surround sound, turn it up full blast and prepare to dance on your living room floor. Henry can play the Strat like he was born with it. You can hear the Stevie Ray Vaughn influences (they are from Texas) in his playing.  JoJo is an awesome bassist,  very technical but he also has a ton of fun improvising up there. Ringo is the glue that holds it all together and he is just as good of a drummer as his brothers are on their axes.  And all three can SING...their harmonies are tight. Their harmonies set them apart from other groups of today. This is not an MTV generation band, this is real music...Everyone from my grandparents to my children can listen to them and enjoy.  You even have Willie Nelson proclaiming them as his favorite band.The Tex/Mex Rock/Blues of LLB is an awesome sound.  Buy the DVD to really see what they are about. I have several concert DVD's (Eagles, Clapton, Johnny Cash) and this one tops them as far as entertainment value. Their albums are great but seeing them live is the only thing that does them justice.  And they are ten times better in person.P.S...some people have mentioned the editing. I didn't even notice it until I read the reviews here.  I don't think the cuts are excessive and I think they actually add to the feel of the DVD.

Keep your eye on this band 'cause I think these west Texas boys are going to go a long way.The concert, as concert DVDs are concerned, was a good solid rock/blues concert. Yes, as others have said there are some editing problems, but I do not think the poor editing takes away from the overall quality of the show.All their songs from their first debut album are present, and there are a few jams sessions between certain songs, and some different arrangements on several tunes. The sound quality is not the best compared to other concert DVDs I've reviewed or seen, but the show was fantastic. These guys have a great quality about their song writing, and these songs are their first real big efforts. I can't even imagine how much better their skills will be after two or three albums from now.If you have never heard Los Lonely Boys but you like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Carlos Santana, or Ritchie Valens/Buddy Holly type music, then you will really like LLB. In many of their tunes they pay tribute to their musical heroes.This DVD contains extra footage of the band, their families, where they grew up (San Angelo Texas - just south of where I grew up) and a few fun home videos and pics of the band.

Some concerts are theatrical like David Bowie's and quick pace editing with full use of lights, colors camera techniques and angles are appropriate but these guys would have come off a LOT better had this DVD been done at Austin City Limits.  Instead, its a very inappropriate MTV style video that detacts from their rich harmonies and fantastic musicianship.
