Higner ""J.C.Dingo""","[20, 22]","I have to say; when it came to understanding and researching the center of the Earth and the planet's contstruction for my novel, this show covered it well. The extra feature, Inside The Volcano, was a perfect bonus, (although the bonus is rather long and not as well paced owing to the time it was made).I should point out that Patrick Steward IS on this DVD--he is in the bonus feature documentary, Inside The Volcano, produced about 1996. He is there, but not in the main feature. That's where the confusion comes from. I own it, and I recognized his voice.Good stuff overall :)",5,"Incredible work here. And P.

I think this is a good intro for my Geo class.  It gives a good overview of the Earth's layers starting all the way from what gravity does for life all the way to the core.  The presentation uses excellent graphics while the topics are interesting.  I would say this doesn't go in depth on anything and in reality it is a little cursory but it does seem to keep the students attention with interesting little details like amphibians were once the largest predator and the size of alligators.  I show particularly for that reason.  I'm trying to hook the students interest from the start and this seems to grab some of the borderline students.  So if you are looking for a well done, entertaining but also enlightening video on the Earth's internal structure, I recommend this.",5,great presentation with good general info,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,875,"['teach', 'Introductory', 'Geology', 'Earth', 'Science', 'am', 'always', 'lookout', 'movies', 'class', 'think', 'good', 'intro', 'Geo', 'class', 'good', 'overview', 'Earth', 'layers', 'starting', 'way', 'what', 'gravity', 'life', 'way', 'core', 'presentation', 'excellent', 'graphics', 'topics', 'are', 'interesting', 'would', 'say', ""n't"", 'go', 'depth', 'anything', 'reality', 'little', 'cursory', 'seem', 'keep', 'students', 'attention', 'interesting', 'little', 'details', 'amphibians', 'were', 'once', 'largest', 'predator', 'size', 'alligators', 'show', 'particularly', 'reason', ""'m"", 'trying', 'hook', 'students', 'interest', 'start', 'grab', 'borderline', 'students', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'well', 'done', 'entertaining', 'also', 'enlightening', 'video', 'Earth', 'internal', 'structure', 'recommend']",Inside Planet Earth
