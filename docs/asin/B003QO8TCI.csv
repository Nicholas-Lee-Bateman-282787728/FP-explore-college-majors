1359023,A3STUMJCZBHDBL,B003QO8TCI,Banzaidog,"[0, 1]","**SPOILERS AHEAD**I tried watching this via a streaming service, and was extremely disappointed. Too many unrealistic situations -- his wife takes a pre-sex shower, so naturally, he kills time by going out for a good, sweaty run. When his wife is assaulted, the protagonist simply stands there and shouts (despite the fact that he's armed, and the attacker is not). The police doubt his story of an assault, but don't bother to ask the victim, who's nearby.And the pacing was glacial, hindered as well by a story-telling technique that treats scenes much as free-standing vignettes with little obvious linear connection.",1,Couldn't finish it,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,620,"['**SPOILERS', 'AHEAD**I', 'tried', 'watching', 'streaming', 'service', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'Too', 'many', 'unrealistic', 'situations', 'wife', 'pre-sex', 'shower', 'so', 'naturally', 'time', 'going', 'out', 'good', 'sweaty', 'run', 'When', 'wife', 'assaulted', 'protagonist', 'simply', 'shouts', 'fact', 'armed', 'attacker', 'not', 'police', 'doubt', 'story', 'assault', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'ask', 'victim', 'who', 'pacing', 'was', 'glacial', 'hindered', 'as', 'well', 'story-telling', 'technique', 'scenes', 'much', 'free-standing', 'vignettes', 'little', 'obvious', 'linear', 'connection']",Dark Woods
1359024,A1JYFCI5TR09O8,B003QO8TCI,"CR Hawk ""Mr Vic""","[5, 8]","This movie, a psychological thriller with a ""Lolita""-like feel, was the brainchild of it's writer, producer, and lead actor, John Muscarnero.  One tagline for the film is ""the deeper you go, the darker it gets"", and that fits this plot perfectly. It's another film that flew under the radar due to a small budget--it grossed an estimated $1 million--but delivered a story better than some of the big budget flicks from 2009.Muscarnero plays Henry Branch, a caring man who brings his wife Susan--aptly played by Tracy Coogan--to a small house in a secluded wooded area where they can enjoy what little time they have left together in peace.  However, when Henry saves a disturbed teen named Alicia (Mary Kate Wiles) and is subsequently asked by the local sheriff (played by James Russo, recognizable as a convenience store robber in 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and about 100 films since--who's gonna refuse his stare?) to take care of her for a while, the situation starts to deteriorate.  As his wife succumbs to slow dementia caused by her illness, Henry Branch slowly succumbs to the ample attention Alicia gives him.  That's the setup; you'll need to check out ""Dark Woods"" for yourself to see how it all ends.Muscarnero creates a gloomy atmosphere that appropriately gets darker as the movie proceeds.  In the relationships that develop onscreen, you can almost feel the tension and frustration of the main characters.  I definitely liked Muscarnero's writing and producing better than his acting, but overall the movie created enough interest that I wanted to know whether the Branches would make it out of the woods.",4,"Will the Branches Escape the ""Dark Woods""?",1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,1632,"['movie', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Lolita', '-like', 'feel', 'was', 'brainchild', 'writer', 'producer', 'lead', 'actor', 'John', 'Muscarnero', 'One', 'tagline', 'film', 'deeper', 'go', 'darker', 'plot', 'perfectly', 'film', 'flew', 'radar', 'due', 'small', 'budget', 'grossed', 'estimated', '1', 'million', 'delivered', 'story', 'better', 'big', 'budget', 'flicks', '2009.Muscarnero', 'plays', 'Henry', 'Branch', 'caring', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'Susan', 'aptly', 'played', 'Tracy', 'Coogan', 'small', 'house', 'secluded', 'wooded', 'area', 'where', 'can', 'enjoy', 'what', 'little', 'time', 'have', 'left', 'together', 'peace', 'However', 'when', 'Henry', 'disturbed', 'teen', 'named', 'Alicia', 'Mary', 'Kate', 'Wiles', 'subsequently', 'asked', 'local', 'sheriff', 'played', 'James', 'Russo', 'recognizable', 'convenience', 'store', 'robber', '1982', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', '100', 'films', 'who', 'gon', 'refuse', 'stare', 'take', 'care', 'while', 'situation', 'deteriorate', 'wife', 'succumbs', 'slow', 'dementia', 'caused', 'illness', 'Henry', 'Branch', 'slowly', 'ample', 'attention', 'Alicia', 'setup', ""'ll"", 'need', 'check', 'out', 'Dark', 'Woods', 'see', 'how', 'ends.Muscarnero', 'gloomy', 'atmosphere', 'appropriately', 'darker', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'relationships', 'develop', 'onscreen', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'tension', 'frustration', 'main', 'characters', 'definitely', 'liked', 'Muscarnero', 'writing', 'producing', 'better', 'acting', 'movie', 'created', 'enough', 'interest', 'wanted', 'know', 'Branches', 'would', 'make', 'woods']",Dark Woods
