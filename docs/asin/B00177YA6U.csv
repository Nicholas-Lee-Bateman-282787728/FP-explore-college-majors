It's a really sad story in the end of course. The husband of the woman that took the girl in tried something he shouldn't be trying with the girl. The fact that he was trying to cover up his mis-deeds is what led to a slew of rumors about the girl. An innocent teen. It feed into the jealousy & unhappiness of the woman that agreed to take care of her (wife of the loser that started the lies about the girl) & no one knew enough about human personalites back then (the real crime took place years ago) to understand that he had made up the lies to cover his own tracks. This was back in a time when most people didn't even think about something really ugly happening to kids, especially something personal like this guy tried. Anyway, very interesting story. If you want a real study in psychology & the weakness of the average human's understanding of others & their motives. (most of the townspeople & people in the school believed the guys lies because they had no idea of his guilt). this is a great story for that.

1156356,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00177YA6U,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`An American Crime', the Showtime movie which recounts the atrocities that took place at 3850 East New York Street in Indianapolis in 1965, is certainly difficult to watch.  It is one of those movies that will make you extremely uncomfortable, squeamish and even nauseous.  It is a film that will make you hate people and may even cause you to seethe with anger.`An American Crime' documents one of the most horrific crimes ever committed.In 1965, young Sylvia Likens and her sister Jennie were left in the care of single mother Gertrude Baniszewski by their carnie parents.  Gertrude had six children of her own and was poor as dirt.  She struggled to get by, but the Likens promised her $20 a week to take care of the girls.  The Likens themselves were not the most financially set, and so it wasn't long before their payments began showing up late.  This sparked outrage in the mentally unstable Gertrude and she began taking out her frustrations on the girls, most notably Sylvia, who was the eldest of the two.  When Sylvia betrayed the trust of Gertrude's eldest daughter Paula (quite accidentally, and with the best of intentions), Paula began to egg her mother on in the torment and humiliation of Sylvia, going as far as to make up vicious lies in order to get her mother to detest Sylvia.  Within time Sylvia was locked in the basement and tortured (beaten, starved, burned, branded) on a daily basis by Gertrude, her children and the neighborhood kids.This is all true, and it is sickening, disgusting and quite honestly, all involved should have been tortured to death.The film isn't constructed in the best way.  It feels cheap, and it certainly wears the name `television movie' well; feeling in parts too restrained to be a feature film.  That isn't to say that the acts of horror committed don't resonate, because they still boil the blood, but they are shown in typically television type style.  Certain scenes are heavily manipulated and bare a `stereotypical' purpose.  This is especially prominent in the beginning scenes, when you have shots of girls playing pillow fight and then the door ominously closing them in.  It is just done in such a clich&eacute;d manner that it feels forced and thus loses real impact.  I also loathed the voice over.  Having Ellen Page speak in such a drugged up voice was too manipulative.  It just felt stagy.  It is also very melodramatic.  It feels almost soap operatic at times, really manipulating tensions when a more realistic and sporadic approach would have chilled the bones quicker.  The story doesn't feel as fleshed out as is could, and the actual true story is altered in parts, which was unnecessary since the truth is just as astonishingly disturbing as anything else, so straightforward was all that needed to be done.Part of my reservations with the film stem from the fact that I can't understand why anyone would want to be entertained with this material.  I remember feeling the same way when I watched `Mysterious Skin'.  It is just not a subject that I think anyone should WANT to watch.  This is a gross and disgusting depiction of horrible torture and the murder of an innocent girl who did nothing wrong.  Some people are evil, but what is depicted here (emotionally and mentally especially) is more horrific than movies like `Saw' or other horror films because the situations are too intimate.  You can detach yourself from a group of teens running from a masked killer.  It is hard to detach yourself from a young, helpless teenager trapped in a basement and continually brutalized by an entire neighborhood of kids.But, I will say this; Catherine Keener and Ellen Page are tremendous here.So I'm torn.  It has serious flaws, and the subject is not one I would recommend entertaining yourself with, but Keener and Page pour their souls into these performances, so if you are a movie buff you may want to see it for them alone.",2,I want to throw up...,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,3906,"['American', 'Crime', 'Showtime', 'movie', 'atrocities', 'took', 'place', '3850', 'East', 'New', 'York', 'Street', 'Indianapolis', '1965', 'certainly', 'difficult', 'watch', 'one', 'movies', 'will', 'make', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'squeamish', 'even', 'nauseous', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'hate', 'people', 'may', 'even', 'cause', 'seethe', 'anger.', 'American', 'Crime', 'documents', 'one', 'most', 'horrific', 'crimes', 'ever', 'committed.In', '1965', 'young', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'sister', 'Jennie', 'were', 'left', 'care', 'single', 'mother', 'Gertrude', 'Baniszewski', 'carnie', 'parents', 'Gertrude', 'had', 'six', 'children', 'own', 'was', 'poor', 'dirt', 'struggled', 'get', 'Likens', 'promised', '20', 'week', 'take', 'care', 'girls', 'Likens', 'were', 'not', 'most', 'financially', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'payments', 'began', 'showing', 'up', 'late', 'sparked', 'outrage', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'Gertrude', 'began', 'taking', 'out', 'frustrations', 'girls', 'most', 'notably', 'Sylvia', 'who', 'was', 'eldest', 'two', 'When', 'Sylvia', 'betrayed', 'trust', 'Gertrude', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Paula', 'quite', 'accidentally', 'best', 'intentions', 'Paula', 'began', 'egg', 'mother', 'torment', 'humiliation', 'Sylvia', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'make', 'up', 'vicious', 'lies', 'order', 'get', 'mother', 'detest', 'Sylvia', 'time', 'Sylvia', 'was', 'locked', 'basement', 'tortured', 'beaten', 'starved', 'burned', 'branded', 'daily', 'basis', 'Gertrude', 'children', 'neighborhood', 'kids.This', 'true', 'sickening', 'disgusting', 'quite', 'honestly', 'involved', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tortured', 'death.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'constructed', 'best', 'way', 'cheap', 'certainly', 'name', 'television', 'movie', 'well', 'feeling', 'parts', 'too', 'restrained', 'be', 'feature', 'film', ""n't"", 'say', 'acts', 'horror', 'committed', 'do', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'still', 'boil', 'blood', 'are', 'shown', 'typically', 'television', 'type', 'style', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'heavily', 'manipulated', 'bare', 'stereotypical', 'purpose', 'especially', 'prominent', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'when', 'have', 'shots', 'girls', 'playing', 'pillow', 'fight', 'then', 'door', 'ominously', 'closing', 'just', 'done', 'such', 'clich', 'eacute', 'manner', 'forced', 'thus', 'loses', 'real', 'impact', 'also', 'loathed', 'voice', 'Having', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'speak', 'such', 'drugged', 'up', 'voice', 'was', 'too', 'manipulative', 'just', 'felt', 'stagy', 'also', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'almost', 'soap', 'operatic', 'times', 'really', 'manipulating', 'tensions', 'when', 'more', 'realistic', 'sporadic', 'approach', 'would', 'have', 'chilled', 'bones', 'quicker', 'story', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fleshed', 'out', 'could', 'actual', 'true', 'story', 'altered', 'parts', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'truth', 'just', 'astonishingly', 'disturbing', 'anything', 'else', 'so', 'straightforward', 'was', 'needed', 'be', 'done.Part', 'reservations', 'film', 'stem', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'material', 'remember', 'feeling', 'same', 'way', 'when', 'watched', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'just', 'not', 'subject', 'think', 'anyone', 'should', 'WANT', 'watch', 'gross', 'disgusting', 'depiction', 'horrible', 'torture', 'murder', 'innocent', 'girl', 'who', 'did', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'people', 'are', 'evil', 'what', 'depicted', 'here', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'especially', 'more', 'horrific', 'movies', 'Saw', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'situations', 'are', 'too', 'intimate', 'can', 'detach', 'group', 'teens', 'running', 'masked', 'killer', 'hard', 'detach', 'young', 'helpless', 'teenager', 'trapped', 'basement', 'continually', 'brutalized', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'kids.But', 'will', 'say', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'are', 'tremendous', 'here.So', ""'m"", 'torn', 'serious', 'flaws', 'subject', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'entertaining', 'Keener', 'Page', 'pour', 'souls', 'performances', 'so', 'are', 'movie', 'buff', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'alone']",An American Crime

1156358,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B00177YA6U,Artist & Author,"[8, 10]","I have more than 3,000 live-action movies dealing with children and teens.  Fortunately, only a handful deal with such serious child abuse.  The only one that equals 'An American Crime' is the French Canadian movie entitled 'Aurore' - ( see the Amazon listing at:  http://www.amazon.com/Aurore-Original-French-Version-Subtitles/dp/B000CEOMV2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1229583719&sr;=1-1 It is probably easier to find the movie on Amazon.ca.)  In both cases, the child subject is killed by an evil 'caregiver' woman.Many others have commented on this movie, so I can probably add little in that respect.  One aspect of the movie others have mentioned that I agree with is that it is extremely weak in relation to any aspect other than just what happened.  This is sharply in contrast with 'Aurore.'  The Canadian movie tells the story of a girl who was abused and killed by a stepmother; but it doesn't stop there.  It was because of Aurore Gagnon's death in 1920 that the whole network of Child Protective Services was set up in Canada.  [There was a 1951 version of 'Aurore' - and the actress who played the mother in that movie was so hated by the public she could not find work in the movies again.]  In 'An American Crime' we are never told if Sylvia's abuse resulted in anything good.  In fact, Sylvia's narration tells the viewers that she still hasn't found the meaning in what happened to her.Also, both movies deal with the community involvement, or maybe I should say lack of involvement in stopping the abuse.  Indeed, Sylvia's case could be considered to be even more evil than Aurore's case because some of the neighborhood kids actually took part in Sylvia's abuse.  In both movies, the church pastor was an integral part of the story.  We never are told why Sylvia's Baptist pastor did so little.  In Aurore's case, her Catholic priest was an intellectual, a book scholar and professor, who was sent to pastor a rural parish for which he was sorely ill suited.  Still, neighbors and others in the community were aware that (at least) something horrible was happening and they did nothing; it was 'mind your own business' gone amuck.I believe that everyone born is given an assignment by God to accomplish with their life, and when that assignment has been accomplished, He takes them 'home' to Heaven.  Sylvia might not see the meaning in her abuse and death, but I have a feeling that everyone who sees this movie (or 'Aurore') and who has a heart for children will not stand idly by if they ever even suspect that a child is being abused.  If that is the case, then Sylvia's life and suffering was not in vain.  Six-year-old Adam Walsh was murdered, and that propelled his father, John, to host 'America's Most Wanted,' a show that has saved many kidnapped children and also put hundreds of criminals behind bars.  I would guess that little Adam is in Heaven looking down in amazement at how much his death has done to make life better for many others.  I think Sylvia would probably have the same 'Heavenly experience' as Adam.June 21, 2009 - I just watched the movie 'The Girl Next Door,' which is supposedly about this same case.  That movie possibly gives a more graphic description about what happened to Sylvia - at least that is what I've read.  However, the rest of the facts of the case are so skewed I wouldn't be surprised if the abuse was also mostly fiction as well.  At any rate, if you watch 'The Girl Next Door,' then you must watch this one to get a true perspective of the case.  If you are more interested it the facts, then skip 'The Girl Next Door' and watch this one only.  [My impression of  'The Girl Next Door' was that it was done on such a low budget that they had to play fast and lose with the facts.  The most blatant to me was where the police storm in at just the right moment, that they take the younger sister away and just leave Meg (the Sylvia character) to die on a mattress as David tries to comfort her.]  In my opinion, 'An American Crime' is a far superior movie to 'The Girl Next Door.'",4,An American 'Aurore',1229472000,"12 17, 2008",2008,4050,"['have', 'more', '3,000', 'live-action', 'movies', 'dealing', 'children', 'teens', 'Fortunately', 'only', 'handful', 'deal', 'such', 'serious', 'child', 'abuse', 'only', 'one', ""'An"", 'American', 'Crime', 'French', 'Canadian', 'movie', 'entitled', 'see', 'Amazon', 'listing', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/Aurore-Original-French-Version-Subtitles/dp/B000CEOMV2/ref=sr_1_1', 'ie=UTF8', 's', '=dvd', 'qid', '=1229583719', 'sr', '=1-1', 'probably', 'easier', 'find', 'movie', 'Amazon.ca', 'cases', 'child', 'subject', 'killed', 'evil', ""'caregiver"", 'woman.Many', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'movie', 'can', 'probably', 'add', 'little', 'respect', 'One', 'aspect', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'agree', 'extremely', 'weak', 'relation', 'aspect', 'other', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'sharply', 'contrast', ""'Aurore"", 'Canadian', 'movie', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'abused', 'killed', 'stepmother', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'was', 'Aurore', 'Gagnon', 'death', '1920', 'whole', 'network', 'Child', 'Protective', 'Services', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'Canada', '[', 'was', '1951', 'version', ""'Aurore"", 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'mother', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'hated', 'public', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'work', 'movies', 'again', ']', ""'An"", 'American', 'Crime', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'Sylvia', 'abuse', 'resulted', 'anything', 'good', 'fact', 'Sylvia', 'narration', 'viewers', 'still', ""n't"", 'found', 'meaning', 'what', 'happened', 'her.Also', 'movies', 'deal', 'community', 'involvement', 'maybe', 'should', 'say', 'lack', 'involvement', 'stopping', 'abuse', 'Indeed', 'Sylvia', 'case', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'evil', 'Aurore', 'case', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'actually', 'took', 'part', 'Sylvia', 'abuse', 'movies', 'church', 'pastor', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'never', 'are', 'told', 'why', 'Sylvia', 'Baptist', 'pastor', 'did', 'so', 'little', 'Aurore', 'case', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'was', 'intellectual', 'book', 'scholar', 'professor', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'pastor', 'rural', 'parish', 'was', 'sorely', 'ill', 'suited', 'Still', 'neighbors', 'others', 'community', 'were', 'aware', 'least', 'something', 'horrible', 'was', 'happening', 'did', 'nothing', 'was', ""'mind"", 'own', 'business', 'gone', 'amuck.I', 'believe', 'everyone', 'born', 'given', 'assignment', 'God', 'accomplish', 'life', 'when', 'assignment', 'been', 'accomplished', 'Heaven', 'Sylvia', 'might', 'not', 'see', 'meaning', 'abuse', 'death', 'have', 'feeling', 'everyone', 'who', 'movie', ""'Aurore"", 'who', 'heart', 'children', 'will', 'not', 'stand', 'idly', 'ever', 'even', 'suspect', 'child', 'being', 'abused', 'case', 'then', 'Sylvia', 'life', 'suffering', 'was', 'not', 'vain', 'Six-year-old', 'Adam', 'Walsh', 'was', 'murdered', 'propelled', 'father', 'John', 'host', ""'America"", 'Most', 'Wanted', 'show', 'saved', 'many', 'kidnapped', 'children', 'also', 'put', 'hundreds', 'criminals', 'bars', 'would', 'guess', 'little', 'Adam', 'Heaven', 'looking', 'down', 'amazement', 'how', 'much', 'death', 'done', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'many', 'others', 'think', 'Sylvia', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'same', ""'Heavenly"", 'experience', 'Adam.June', '21', '2009', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'supposedly', 'same', 'case', 'movie', 'possibly', 'more', 'graphic', 'description', 'what', 'happened', 'Sylvia', 'least', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'However', 'rest', 'facts', 'case', 'are', 'so', 'skewed', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'abuse', 'was', 'also', 'mostly', 'fiction', 'as', 'well', 'rate', 'watch', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'then', 'must', 'watch', 'one', 'get', 'true', 'perspective', 'case', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'facts', 'then', ""'The"", 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'watch', 'one', 'only', '[', 'My', 'impression', ""'The"", 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'was', 'was', 'done', 'low', 'budget', 'had', 'play', 'fast', 'lose', 'facts', 'most', 'blatant', 'was', 'where', 'police', 'storm', 'just', 'right', 'moment', 'take', 'younger', 'sister', 'away', 'just', 'leave', 'Meg', 'Sylvia', 'character', 'die', 'mattress', 'David', 'comfort', ']', 'opinion', 'American', 'Crime', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', ""'The"", 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door']",An American Crime

1156360,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00177YA6U,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 5]","This film is so disgusting, so horridly grotesque and inhumane, that you won't be able to pull yourself away; like rubbernecking at a really bad car wreck.Based on the true story of Sylvia Likens (played here by Ellen Page,Juno) and her terminal abuse at the hands of the mentally deranged Gertrude Baniszewski (Catherine Keener,Capote), the film pulls no punches, giving us all the terrible sequences that led up to Sylvia's death at the age of thirteen.More disturbing (to me, at least) was the fact that Sylvia's parents dropped her (and her sister) off with a woman they knew very, very little about. But leaving Sylvia and her sister Jennifer (Hayley McFarland,24) with a mentally ill woman (that they didn't know was mentally ill) probably isn't that much of a shock considering it was a time when America was still battling with its ideals (the 60s). Going beyond horrifying is the fact that neighbors heard the screams of Sylvia but did nothing about it. And young kids in the neighborhood partook in the abuse of Sylvia and no one, not one single person, thought to contact the authorities. The horrors of watching Sylvia's physical decline paled in comparison to the horrors of what didn't get done.Catherine Keener was nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her creepy performance, and well deserved are those accolades. Her transference of all that was wrong in her life onto Sylvia is completely believable, making her role as Gertrude exceptionally frightening.A word of caution: this film is NOT for the light of heart. It is brutal, unflinching storytelling about a time when America had to identify problems it wanted to keep hidden, and this film shows that in all of its goose-bumping, gory, glory.

I am reading ""House of Evil"" currently, and am very glad that I am half-way through.  As a matter of fact, I was surprisingly relieved (you would be too) at the part where Sylvia dies, as her treatment was so horrific that it is almost unreadable.  (It should be noted that, while this film is surely hard to watch, it sugarcoats what really happened.  There are events that happened that could not be shown in American film.)People always think, ""Why didn't Jenny tell her parents what was going on?  How could you Jenny her sister die?""  Well, I know why.  When I was very young - about the exact same timeframe that Sylvia died - my brother, sister and I had a babysitter.  My sister, who was an infant, hit her head and was injured when we were being taken care of by a babysitter.  The babysitter screamed, ""Get that girl to shut up!"" and went back to watching her TV show.  My brother and I told our parents about it, told them that the babysitter wasn't doing her job.  What did they do?  Told us that we were overreacting.This kind of stuff goes on all the time, because most parents are so lazy they don't want to have to find someone else to watch their kids.  A message to you parents out there:  if your kid complains about the babysitter, it is your job to listen.Very nice performances here by Katherine Keener and Ellen Paige.  Ms. Keener has always been one of my favorites, and she does a great job here not devolving into caricature.  Nice job as well by the writer/director, as they carefully weave conjecture as to the psychological motivations and issues of the mother.I read that one of the children, later in life, admitted that they all should have been punished more severely.

1156363,A2W1FEPSD6EOCI,B00177YA6U,cinephile,"[0, 0]","I was at the world premiere of this film at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. I read the blurb in the program book, but had no clue what I was in for. The film starts out with a girl talking. After you watch the film you realize, it is a dead girl talking. I had no idea who Sylvia Likens was much less what she had endured as an abused 16 year old until I saw this film. Ten to twenty minutes into the film I could feel several knots in my stomach and an exhorbitant amount of rage because of the images I was watching. This film is heavy and hard to watch. So heavy that chaos errupted in the movie theatre when an audience member, who sat behind me, collapsed. This was not an elderly person I might ad. He, yes ""HE"" was probably between 25-28. At first I heard people whispering that an elderly lady suffered a heart attack, then people started to scream for the lights to be turned on and for the projectionist to stop the film. The lights were turned on and the film was stopped. It almost seemed like someone had placed a bomb in the theatre because people where heading for the exit, others where frightened and did not know what to do, and others just sat in their chair waiting for the film to continue. Of course, the next day, this was the talk of the town. Back to the film. I have never seen a girl tortured in the ways Sylvia had. I love disturbing films... I watch French film all the time...but I have never seen anything like this. And I must say, after watching the film, I went back to my condo to look up the case on the internet and must report that the film is not exploitative. As a matter of fact, it places the events quiet mildly compared to what really happened. Even though this movie is very unpleasant to watch, it is important every American and foreigners alike watches this film so they will never forget what children are exposed to when abused. How little power they have and how they really depend on their caretakers to ""take care"" of them until they reach an age they can fend for themselves. We hear these cases on television almost every day of a child being abducted. But in this case, the child was not abducted, she, Sylvia, and her sister were abandoned by her parents. I believe her parents got off easy. I was so filled with rage, both her parents deserved the same torture and faith Sylvia did. They made the conscious choice of bringing this girl into the world and they'd dumped her off to strangers. I'm sure they never imagined what would happened to their daughter. A lot for this case is to blame for the times they lived in. Apparently Indiana and other mid west areas where evangelical and believed in corporal punishment in those days and when they heard the torturous screams of Sylvia neighbors just thought she was getting what she deserved by being a bad girl. In there eyes she was being ""corrected"". Besides the sick lady that took care of Sylvia, the seven children that lived with her unfortunately did not know any better as they too join in the torture fest as they called upon other neighborhood kids to have fun with Sylvia by torturing her. I read on the internet that a few of the neighborhood kids to helped torture Sylvia are still alive and kicking today. One is 58 years old, he was 15 at the time, and apparently just recently lost his job after word about this film and his involvement in the case turned up. I hope this film helps to shed light to all of those crud of the earth who are still left on this earth living who tortured that girl when they were young and stupid so they will never forget what they did. I hope someone will always recognize them walking on the street to remind them how much of a low life and human waste of a person they are. They may be the brothes, now fathers, loving husbands and whatever else...but they will never stop being monsters rooted in evil who destroyed a spirit for their amuzement. Too bad they can't be tried again, but there is always the judge and jury of public opinion which Im sure as long as we know who you are, you will always be reminded of your heinous crimes. I applaud the filmmaker and actors for making such as exquisite, well acted, directed and visually engaging film.

1156367,A2D2Y3WTG2WACT,B00177YA6U,"David R. Moffatt ""DaveMmn""","[4, 4]","""An American Crime"" presents a streamlined retelling of an actual 1965 child abuse case which resulted in the death of 15 year old Sylvia Likens.  It is told through a combination of dramatizations of the abuse Sylvia suffered at the hands of the woman charged with caring for her, along with, frighteningly, the woman's own children and several neighborhood kids who in the film at least appear to have joined in the abuse and torture with nary a hint of conscience in sight.While ""based on a true story""--and yes, the setting, characters, and most of the major events are indeed drawn from the real-life case (down to using exact dates and courtroom testimony drawn from real-life transcripts), this must not be mistaken for a documentary.  A number of events from the real-life case are omitted entirely and the abuse and torture of Sylvia Likens is, mercifully, toned down from the reality.  I applaud this choice on the part of the filmmakers.  While the film is grim from beginning to end and no punches are pulled as far as what occurred, far more is suggested than is shown, and horrors which truly could not have been depicted in a mainstream movie are omitted entirely.  Less successful are the director's occasional forays into surrealism, possibly in an attempt to depict Sylvia's attempts to escape from the horrors of reality by retreating into memories of a happier time.  In particular, a scene near the end is so confusing that one may end up watching the credits crawl for a while before realizing that the climax of the film has come and gone.The film has an interesting psychological undertone which attempts to explain seemingly inexplicable events.  One sees the repressed atmosphere which is often the precursor of hysteria, the naming of a scapegoat, the gathering storm as the scapegoat becomes victim, and the transference of the guilt of the ""community"" (in this case, a small group of children and two adults) onto the scapegoat as much in the hope of avoiding meeting the same fate as anything else.  In a single household, one sees the progression of the mindset which, once entrenched, burns witches.  And we see the faces of the villagers who march with the mob rather than risk becoming the object of the mob's pitchforks and torches.The atmosphere in ""An American Crime"" is nearly palpable, shifting rapidly back and forth between the bleak, grimy interior of the house in which most of the story takes place and the neutral, almost sterile presence of the courtroom scenes (which often appear almost as a relief just as matters onscreen approach the point at which one wants to turn away).  Silence is a character in the film as much as any of the actors: the silence which builds dread in the knowledge that another horror is forthcoming, the silence of those who hear screams coming from the house and either ignore them utterly or decide to ""mind their own business"", and the final, terrible, moment of silence which marks the end of Sylvia Likens' life.The acting is top-notch and the actors bear a surprising resemblance to the real-life people behind it.  Whether the real-life individuals really acted as they do in movie is a matter for some conjecture.  Nonetheless, you will come away from this film realizing that you have seen the face of evil, and that sometimes it is an ordinary, even a smiling face.  Perhaps even the face of someone you know.This movie is likely to haunt you, and it should.  I highly recommend some independent reading on the real-life case which inspired the movie.  Grim reading though it may be, there is nevertheless a certain fascinating atmosphere to the story.  Perhaps because it really happened, it still happens today, and if we remain silent and insist that it's ""better to mind our own business"", we place ourselves in danger of becoming accomplices to horror, just as did those in this film.  We can do better.  We owe Sylvia Likens that.",4,Not Easily Forgotten--And Rightly So,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,3921,"['American', 'Crime', 'streamlined', 'retelling', 'actual', '1965', 'child', 'abuse', 'case', 'resulted', 'death', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'told', 'combination', 'dramatizations', 'abuse', 'Sylvia', 'suffered', 'hands', 'woman', 'charged', 'caring', 'frighteningly', 'woman', 'own', 'children', 'several', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'who', 'film', 'least', 'appear', 'have', 'joined', 'abuse', 'torture', 'hint', 'conscience', 'sight.While', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'yes', 'setting', 'characters', 'most', 'major', 'events', 'are', 'indeed', 'drawn', 'real-life', 'case', 'using', 'exact', 'dates', 'courtroom', 'testimony', 'drawn', 'real-life', 'transcripts', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'mistaken', 'documentary', 'number', 'events', 'real-life', 'case', 'are', 'omitted', 'entirely', 'abuse', 'torture', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'mercifully', 'toned', 'down', 'reality', 'applaud', 'choice', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'film', 'grim', 'beginning', 'end', 'punches', 'are', 'pulled', 'as', 'far', 'what', 'occurred', 'far', 'more', 'suggested', 'shown', 'horrors', 'truly', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'depicted', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'are', 'omitted', 'entirely', 'Less', 'successful', 'are', 'director', 'occasional', 'forays', 'surrealism', 'possibly', 'attempt', 'depict', 'Sylvia', 'attempts', 'escape', 'horrors', 'reality', 'retreating', 'memories', 'happier', 'time', 'particular', 'scene', 'end', 'so', 'confusing', 'one', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'credits', 'crawl', 'while', 'realizing', 'climax', 'film', 'come', 'gone.The', 'film', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'undertone', 'explain', 'seemingly', 'inexplicable', 'events', 'One', 'repressed', 'atmosphere', 'often', 'precursor', 'hysteria', 'naming', 'scapegoat', 'gathering', 'storm', 'scapegoat', 'victim', 'transference', 'guilt', 'community', 'case', 'small', 'group', 'children', 'two', 'adults', 'scapegoat', 'as', 'much', 'hope', 'avoiding', 'meeting', 'same', 'fate', 'anything', 'else', 'single', 'household', 'one', 'progression', 'mindset', 'once', 'entrenched', 'witches', 'see', 'villagers', 'who', 'march', 'mob', 'rather', 'risk', 'becoming', 'object', 'mob', 'pitchforks', 'torches.The', 'atmosphere', 'American', 'Crime', 'nearly', 'palpable', 'shifting', 'rapidly', 'back', 'forth', 'bleak', 'grimy', 'interior', 'house', 'most', 'story', 'place', 'neutral', 'almost', 'sterile', 'presence', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'often', 'appear', 'almost', 'relief', 'just', 'matters', 'approach', 'point', 'one', 'turn', 'away', 'Silence', 'character', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'actors', 'silence', 'dread', 'knowledge', 'horror', 'forthcoming', 'silence', 'who', 'hear', 'screams', 'coming', 'house', 'ignore', 'utterly', 'decide', 'mind', 'own', 'business', 'final', 'terrible', 'moment', 'silence', 'end', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'life.The', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'actors', 'bear', 'surprising', 'resemblance', 'real-life', 'people', 'real-life', 'individuals', 'really', 'acted', 'do', 'movie', 'matter', 'conjecture', 'Nonetheless', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'realizing', 'have', 'seen', 'face', 'evil', 'ordinary', 'even', 'smiling', 'face', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'face', 'someone', 'know.This', 'movie', 'likely', 'haunt', 'should', 'highly', 'recommend', 'independent', 'reading', 'real-life', 'case', 'inspired', 'movie', 'Grim', 'reading', 'may', 'be', 'nevertheless', 'certain', 'fascinating', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'really', 'happened', 'still', 'today', 'remain', 'silent', 'insist', 'better', 'mind', 'own', 'business', 'place', 'danger', 'becoming', 'accomplices', 'horror', 'just', 'did', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'owe', 'Sylvia', 'Likens']",An American Crime

Excellent cinematography and settings: It's one of those films that is so realistic it's almost as if you are watching the actual events take place. It captures its mid-60s setting equally well, including a fitting soundtrack. AN AMERICAN CRIME moves at a natural pace, wastes no time, and the transitions between the 1965 crimes and the 1966 trial are well-synched.Unlike the more sensationalThe Girl Next Door, a good film in itself but only very loosely based on this crime for the sake of making a horror movie based on Jack Ketchum's cheesy novel, AN AMERICAN CRIME tells the story as it really happened, without flourishes. Catherine Keener gives a painfully fine performance as Gertrude Baniszewski. Unlike ""Auntie Ruth"" in THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, she's more pathetic than truly evil. Notwithstanding the horrible crime she committed, the simple humanity of this woman adds much to the immediacy of the film.Encapsulating this story into 90 minutes, there are the inevitable oversimplifications and small alterations of details. Regardless, the directors and writers did an admirable job of being faithful to reality. Some of the grosser aspects of the crime are left out, and there is no serious gore: The event itself, along with Sylvia Likens's screams, is easily enough to convey the horror of it all.If this true crime story interests you, I would also recommend readingHouse of Evil: The Indiana Torture Slaying (St. Martin's True Crime Library), which, being a book, includes more of the specific details of the matter, particularly in the relationships between the large cast of characters.",4,"""Best if I stay out of it, I think""",1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,1682,"['AN', 'AMERICAN', 'CRIME', 'can', 'imagine', 'very', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'experience', 'Excellent', 'cinematography', 'settings', 'one', 'films', 'so', 'realistic', 'almost', 'are', 'watching', 'actual', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'mid-60s', 'setting', 'equally', 'well', 'including', 'fitting', 'soundtrack', 'AMERICAN', 'CRIME', 'moves', 'natural', 'pace', 'time', 'transitions', '1965', 'crimes', '1966', 'trial', 'are', 'well-synched.Unlike', 'more', 'sensationalThe', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'good', 'film', 'only', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'crime', 'sake', 'making', 'horror', 'movie', 'based', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'cheesy', 'novel', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'CRIME', 'story', 'really', 'happened', 'flourishes', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'painfully', 'fine', 'performance', 'Gertrude', 'Baniszewski', 'Auntie', 'Ruth', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'NEXT', 'DOOR', 'more', 'pathetic', 'truly', 'evil', 'Notwithstanding', 'horrible', 'crime', 'committed', 'simple', 'humanity', 'woman', 'much', 'immediacy', 'film.Encapsulating', 'story', '90', 'minutes', 'are', 'inevitable', 'oversimplifications', 'small', 'alterations', 'details', 'Regardless', 'directors', 'writers', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'being', 'faithful', 'reality', 'grosser', 'aspects', 'crime', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'serious', 'gore', 'event', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'screams', 'easily', 'enough', 'convey', 'horror', 'true', 'crime', 'story', 'interests', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'readingHouse', 'Evil', 'Indiana', 'Torture', 'Slaying', 'St.', 'Martin', 'True', 'Crime', 'Library', 'being', 'book', 'more', 'specific', 'details', 'matter', 'particularly', 'relationships', 'large', 'cast', 'characters']",An American Crime

1156377,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00177YA6U,Grady Harp,"[33, 46]","AN AMERICAN CRIME is a problematic little reenactment of a real criminal case of child abuse dating back to 1965.  The story is horrifying and while the film places the facts in our faces, the impact of the film is out of focus.  This is due to the script that elects to glaze over the motivational aspects of a brutal crime in favor of attempting to investigate fully the mindset of both the perpetrator and the victims. Were it not for some sterling performances by Catherine Keener and Ellen Page this film might be easily dismissed: the strength of these actresses to overcome a weak script and manage to involve us is much to their credit as artists.Indiana, 1965, and Gertrude Baniszewski (Catherine Keener) is a 'borderline' single mother of several children who is asked to take care of Sylvia (Ellen Page) and Jennie Likens (Hayley McFarland) while the girls parents remain on the road as carnies, promising to send checks to help support their farmed out children.  Gertrude is a woman of loose morals who adds babies  to her large family during liaisons with young men like the itinerant Dennis (James Franco).  Gertrude takes in laundry to support her household and requires her young children to work toward the same goal.  A friction develops between Sylvia and Jenny and the children by Gertrude's illicit adventures as well as covert sexual similarities surfacing in her children and at 'family meetings' Gertrude doles out punishment for Sylvia - punishment including cigarette burns, coke bottle insertions, branding etc. - all of which are undeserved and eventually lead to Sylvia's imprisonment in the basement where Gertrude and her children and their friends daily torture Sylvia.  Eventually Sylvia dies and Gertrude and family are brought to court for charges of first-degree murder and variations thereof.  The court proceedings (under the leadership of lawyer Leroy K. New played by Bradley Whitford) provide the story drivers as each allegation is then acted out by flashbacks until the verdicts are reached.Catherine Keener is superb as the deranged, maladaptive Gertrude and Ellen Page adds yet another feather to her cap in a role that in another actor's hands could have been over the top. Writer/director Tommy O'Haver (the script was written with the aid of Irene Turner) does manage to show us the facts of this atrocity yet fails to go inside the characters to give us the psychobiographies this film has the potential for illuminating. It may well repel some viewers, but it does bring to the forefront a crime that is all too common in this country.

There's another version of this same story called ""The Girl Next Door"" that is also good, but that's a fictionalized account of what happened:  this movie, American Crime, is written from the trial transcripts.Summary:  Without spoiling anything, I'll say that after you watch this movie you will probably want to spend some time on Wikipedia and Google researching what happened to the family members involved. I will give you a clue that they all more or less got what was coming to them in the end, so as you watch this movie and see what's done to poor, sweet Sylvia just keep it in the back of your head that those involved are all punished.  This is the story of one twisted family in the mid-60s taking in a young girl and her sister and then torturing the girl. It happens slowly at first, but once they've crossed a line and have the girl in the basement the entire neighborhood gets involved and reverts to brutal animals abusing this young lady.I consider this to be a horror movie.  It does not have monsters or supernatural things in it and it's not done the way a Friday the 13th is done because there are no SCARES! tossed in at you (like a cat jumping out of a dark closet right at the camera or a killer bursting through a window or anything).  But I was scared and on the edge of my seat during this movie nonetheless.  I also kept the lights on in the room which I almost never do.  I only do that during horror movies.  I think it's because the light makes me feel safer and helps me remember it's just a movie I am watching and this is not really happening to someone...only in this case, these horrible things DID happen to someone.This movie is so well-acted that as I was  watching it I really cared for the young girl Sylvia.  I found myself wanting to scream for help for her and I felt frustrated that not only was this just a movie but it was also set so far in the past that there's nothing I could have ever done for this girl.  The actress Ellen Page did such a good job of making me care about her character that I felt really bad that I could not help her escape.  I can't remember the last time I was so invested emotionally in a character like that.A movie like this is hard to watch, though.  It's like of like watching movies like Extremities from the 80s or the more recent We Have to Talk About Kevin.  I don't know what to call this genre, but it should have its own shelf in the horror section.  Maybe ""horrific stories that are scary because they are realistic enough that they could have happened in your neighborhood"".  I think what makes these kinds of movies really scary is that you can't blame the bad things that happen in them on some faceless evil...but you have to admit that the people who live next door to you might be doing this kind of stuff in their basement and you would never know.This is not a date night movie.  It's not a movie to watch if you want to get Friday the 13th type scares....and I honestly recommend watching in on a Saturday afternoon when it's bright out so that it's less creepy and you can have some time to recuperate from the emotional terrorism of it all before you have to go to sleep.

The story is unrelenting and the acting is quite superb. The subject matter however is tough to stomach. This is a true story of unnecessary violence inflicted on a 16 year old girl by a woman who could barely support her own 7 children but agrees to take in 2 teenage girls who weren't related to her in any way for $20 a week. At first, you may feel slight pity for Gertrude, a woman who seems to be struggling to provide for her family while coping with illness. But as time goes by you realize that she is no angel & seems to have other problems as well, such as keeping her legs closed and keeping tabs on her own children. The torture this woman inflicts upon 16 yr old Sylvia is haunting & unforgiving. No real motive is ever given for her actions but this can be said for most true crimes. Sylvia is beaten, burned, violated in ways that would repulse the most hardened of criminals and sentenced to a cold damp basement to die a slow agonizing death. A good movie should invoke real and raw emotion from viewers which is exactly what happens here. It repulsed me, disgusted me, made me cry out of sadness but probably most important, it enraged me. I wanted to jump into the screen & inflict my own form of torture against Gertrude. And then I find out later on the Internet that she was patrolled in 1985 after serving only 20 yrs of her sentence? That is the real American Crime committed here. Shame on our justice system! May Sylvia rest with the Angels now...God bless us all.

Danzig,"[4, 5]","Very well done account of one of the most depraved and heinous crimes in American history: the 1965 torture slaying of Sylvia Likens, an innocent young girl boarding with her sister in the home of one Gertrude Baniszewski in Wichita, Kansas.As a boy of twelve, I remember reading the original story of this shocking murder in Time magazine back when it occurred.The horror of the events leading to Sylvia's death rocked my world back then, and the intervening decades have done nothing to soften the impact of this dreadful tale even today.Of course, this being a Hollywood movie, everyone -- and everything -- seem to look a little better than their real-life counterparts.Katherine Keener is certainly a more attractive woman than the real Gertrude, a lumpen brute if ever there was one, and Ellen Page is cuter than the real Sylvia.If the movie has a failing, it is that the facts of the actual case are so incredible it is hard for the viewer to believe these things really occurred as they are shown here.The sad truth is, there were even worse cruelties inflicted upon poor Sylvia than the ones shown here, including scalding hot baths, salt being rubbed into her open wounds, and other torments I'd rather not go into.People interested in learning the complete facts of the case are advised to read the book, ""House of Evil"" by John Dean (no, it's another John Dean, not Nixon's old pal), which tells the full excruciating account.Still ""An American Crime"" is a very well acted, written, and directed attempt to depict the events and give some meaning to what happened.",4,Black Hole of Depravity in Wichita,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,1576,"['Very', 'well', 'done', 'account', 'one', 'most', 'depraved', 'heinous', 'crimes', 'American', 'history', '1965', 'torture', 'slaying', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'innocent', 'young', 'girl', 'boarding', 'sister', 'home', 'one', 'Gertrude', 'Baniszewski', 'Wichita', 'Kansas.As', 'boy', 'twelve', 'remember', 'reading', 'original', 'story', 'shocking', 'murder', 'Time', 'magazine', 'back', 'when', 'occurred.The', 'horror', 'events', 'leading', 'Sylvia', 'death', 'rocked', 'world', 'back', 'then', 'intervening', 'decades', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'soften', 'impact', 'dreadful', 'tale', 'even', 'today.Of', 'course', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'everyone', 'everything', 'seem', 'look', 'little', 'better', 'real-life', 'counterparts.Katherine', 'Keener', 'certainly', 'more', 'attractive', 'woman', 'real', 'Gertrude', 'lumpen', 'brute', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'cuter', 'real', 'Sylvia.If', 'movie', 'failing', 'facts', 'actual', 'case', 'are', 'so', 'incredible', 'hard', 'viewer', 'believe', 'things', 'really', 'occurred', 'are', 'shown', 'here.The', 'sad', 'truth', 'were', 'even', 'worse', 'cruelties', 'inflicted', 'poor', 'Sylvia', 'ones', 'shown', 'here', 'including', 'scalding', 'hot', 'baths', 'salt', 'being', 'rubbed', 'open', 'wounds', 'other', 'torments', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'go', 'into.People', 'interested', 'learning', 'complete', 'facts', 'case', 'are', 'advised', 'read', 'book', 'House', 'Evil', 'John', 'Dean', 'John', 'Dean', 'not', 'Nixon', 'old', 'pal', 'full', 'excruciating', 'account.Still', 'American', 'Crime', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'written', 'directed', 'attempt', 'depict', 'events', 'give', 'meaning', 'what', 'happened']",An American Crime

It was filled with a variety of gangsters, mass murderers ( I don't think ""serial killer"" had entered the lexicon yet) and other assorted creeps. One perosn in the book that really stuck out and spooked me wasn't Manson or Richard Speck but Indianapolis' own Gertrude Baniszewski, convicted of the true life horrible torture killing of 16 year old Sylvia Likens. The details of she and her charges horrible crimes against young Sylvia  were sickening enough, but her old black and white photo in in the book I saw showed the face of true evil, almost a modern day witch- someone of whom ""bogeyman"" tales are probably still told.""An American Crime"" relives the horrible true crimes committed by Baniszewski in late Summer and early Fall of 1965. A demented, drug addicted single mom with too many mouths to feed takes in two neighborhood girls for a weekly payment from their travelling carney parents. After a misunderstood ""insult"" against her promiscuous daughter, Baniszewski lashes out sadisticly against the older foster child Sylvia. The true account of the case is stomach turning in the totrure and cruelty that Sylvia experienced. At the hands of one maniac, Sylvia's treatment is criminal and barbaric, but as this cruelty came from the hand of not only Baniszewski but her sons, daughters and other neighborhood kids  is unfathomable. I imagine psychologists today could still write volumes on the group think sadism and the adult approval that had one maniac leading about a half dozen others.There's no pretty ending here. Nothing seems to be learned, people go to jail, some for probably way too short a time.Little is settled or speculated upon motive wise by the script. The pretty  Christine Keener is ratted up convincingly and looks the role of the truly haggard real life Mrs. Baniszewski well, but perhaps plays her a little more humanly than I could see the real life psycho to be. Keener has a warm smile and a voice sometimes too soft for the Baniszewski I imagined, but in all does a fine job. Likewise fine acting by Scout Taylor-Hawkins as tbe elder Baniszewski daughter, Evan Peters as the weak minded neighbor Ricky and Ellen Page as the so unfortunate Likens girl.It's a grotesque real life case that happened before America became so jaded- before Color TV, cable TV, TruTV or Nancy Grace nightly brought such pathologic behavior into our living rooms on a nightly basis.",4,"Makes ""Mommie Dearest"" Look Like ""Barney""",1238112000,"03 27, 2009",2009,2513,"['**Spoiler', 'ALert**When', 'was', 'kid', 'parents', 'had', 'book', 'called', 'Encyclopedia', 'Crime', 'similar', 'title', 'was', 'filled', 'variety', 'gangsters', 'mass', 'murderers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'serial', 'killer', 'had', 'entered', 'lexicon', 'yet', 'other', 'assorted', 'creeps', 'One', 'perosn', 'book', 'really', 'stuck', 'out', 'spooked', 'was', ""n't"", 'Manson', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'Indianapolis', 'own', 'Gertrude', 'Baniszewski', 'convicted', 'true', 'life', 'horrible', 'torture', 'killing', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'details', 'charges', 'horrible', 'crimes', 'young', 'Sylvia', 'were', 'sickening', 'enough', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'photo', 'book', 'saw', 'showed', 'face', 'true', 'evil', 'almost', 'modern', 'day', 'witch-', 'someone', 'whom', 'bogeyman', 'tales', 'are', 'probably', 'still', 'told', 'American', 'Crime', 'horrible', 'true', 'crimes', 'committed', 'Baniszewski', 'late', 'Summer', 'early', 'Fall', '1965', 'demented', 'drug', 'addicted', 'single', 'mom', 'too', 'many', 'mouths', 'feed', 'two', 'neighborhood', 'girls', 'weekly', 'payment', 'travelling', 'carney', 'parents', 'misunderstood', 'insult', 'promiscuous', 'daughter', 'Baniszewski', 'out', 'sadisticly', 'older', 'foster', 'child', 'Sylvia', 'true', 'account', 'case', 'stomach', 'turning', 'totrure', 'cruelty', 'Sylvia', 'experienced', 'hands', 'one', 'maniac', 'Sylvia', 'treatment', 'criminal', 'barbaric', 'cruelty', 'came', 'hand', 'not', 'only', 'Baniszewski', 'sons', 'daughters', 'other', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'unfathomable', 'imagine', 'psychologists', 'today', 'could', 'still', 'write', 'volumes', 'group', 'think', 'sadism', 'adult', 'approval', 'had', 'one', 'maniac', 'leading', 'half', 'dozen', 'pretty', 'ending', 'here', 'Nothing', 'be', 'learned', 'people', 'go', 'jail', 'probably', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'time.Little', 'settled', 'speculated', 'motive', 'wise', 'script', 'pretty', 'Christine', 'Keener', 'ratted', 'up', 'convincingly', 'role', 'truly', 'haggard', 'real', 'life', 'Mrs.', 'Baniszewski', 'well', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'humanly', 'could', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'psycho', 'be', 'Keener', 'warm', 'smile', 'voice', 'sometimes', 'too', 'soft', 'Baniszewski', 'imagined', 'fine', 'job', 'Likewise', 'fine', 'acting', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Hawkins', 'tbe', 'elder', 'Baniszewski', 'daughter', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'weak', 'minded', 'neighbor', 'Ricky', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'so', 'unfortunate', 'Likens', 'girl.It', 'grotesque', 'real', 'life', 'case', 'happened', 'America', 'became', 'so', 'jaded-', 'Color', 'TV', 'cable', 'TV', 'TruTV', 'Nancy', 'Grace', 'nightly', 'brought', 'such', 'pathologic', 'behavior', 'living', 'rooms', 'nightly', 'basis']",An American Crime
1156388,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B00177YA6U,JLind555,"[72, 79]","In the summer of 1965, two young girls, Sylvia Likens, age 16 and her little sister Jennie, crippled with polio, were left by their itinerant parents in the care of Gertrude Baniszewski, a divorced mother of seven, in a blue-collar neighborhood in Indiana, who agreed to care for them for $20 a week while their parents traveled the carnival circuit.  Three months later, Sylvia was dead, and Gertrude Baniszewski was standing trial for first-degree murder, accused of having engineered Sylvia's death by torture.The film, ""An American Crime"", shown on the Showtime cable channel, follows Sylvia's last three months fairly closely.  Gertrude Baniszewski, who may or may not have been playing with a full deck to begin with, progressed from slaps and spankings when the support checks arrived late, to more grotesque punishments after Sylvia ""lied"" about Baniszewski's oldest daughter Paula being pregnant (Paula actually was pregnant by a married man), culminating in Sylvia being locked in the basement and systematically tortured not only by Gertrude Baniszewksi and six of her seven children (the baby was too young to participate), but also by several neighborhood children who stopped by from time to time after school to join in the fun.  Even worse, Gertrude forced Jennie Likens to take part in abusing her sister, threatening to do the same thing to her if she didn't.  By the time Sylvia mercifully died of shock and abuse, there was hardly a square inch on her body that had not been cut, scalded, beaten, burned with cigarettes, or subjected to whatever torments the Baniszewskis could dream up, including scratching the words onto her abdomen with red-hot needles in letters two inches high ""I'M A PROSTITUTE AND PROUD OF IT"".  The movie notes that although Gertrude Baniszewski started this particular act, she was too squeamish to finish it, so she got one of the neighborhood boys, Ricky Hobbs, to do it for her.The film tells the story in a straightforward manner without any attempt to help us understand why these horrific events took place, and the director has come under some criticism for this.  Perhaps there was no attempt to explain why Sylvia had to go through such hell during the last three tormented months of her life because there is no explanation.  One can sympathize with Gertrude Baniszewski up to a point; she was abandoned by her husband to bring seven children up alone with no child support; she was pregnant thirteen times resulting in seven children and six stillbirths or miscarriages; and her boyfriend was abusive to her; but millions of other women have gone through much worse than Gertrude Baniszewski has, and none, to my knowledge, has systematically tortured another human being to death.  Was her circumstances to blame for her actions?  I don't think so.  Was her mental state to blame?  Or was the bad hand she was dealt by life responsible?  Again, how do you explain that millions of people have had it much worse than Gertrude Baniszewski without resorting to the level of depraved savagery with which she treated Sylvia Likens?  Did she just see in Sylvia something she had hated all her life and was determined to destroy?  We don't know, and wisely, the director doesn't assign this as a reason for Baniszewski's actions.  The film also raises the question, which was never answered in the real case, of why the neighborhood children turned into willing, even eager, participants.  What kind of enviromnent spawns children like this?The acting in the film is uniformly good across the board, with Ellen Page turning in a sensitive and well-nuanced performance as Sylvia and Catherine Keener giving a chilling portrayal of Gertrude Baniszewski.  I didn't feel the movie was being made for its shock value, although what happened to Sylvia was shocking enough, nor do I fault the director for not indulging in specious ""explanations"" for the inexplicable.  The film does raise a much larger question: was Gertrude Baniszewski mentally ill or was she just plain evil?  Is evil a form of mental illness or an entity in itself?  One can argue that question endlessly and get nowhere.  We're left with a lot of unanswered questions, and perhaps this is what unsettles so many people who watch this movie.  Some things don't have any explanation, or at least an explanation we want to accept.  Sometimes even the perpetrators are left at a loss.  ""Sylvia wanted something,"" Gertrude Baniszewski said during her trial for which she was ultimately convicted of murder and spent twenty years in jail before being paroled in 1985, ""but I could never find out what it was.""  Perhaps Sylvia just wanted to be treated like another human being.Judy Lind",4,"Trying to ""explain"" the inexplicable",1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,4698,"['summer', '1965', 'two', 'young', 'girls',

1156389,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00177YA6U,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[26, 29]","When I reviewed The Girl Next Door, which is also based on the case of Sylvia Likens, I could hardly put my thoughts into words. I sat in front of my computer screen for hours knowing that I needed to write something, but unable to find the words, which is somewhat frustrating for a writer. No such problem exists with this film, An American Crime.An American Crime is more true to the actual events then The Girl Next Door, although it skips over a lot of the abuse and doesn't really give a clear picture of what this young girl was forced to endure during those few months in late 1965. Sylvia Likens, fondly nicknamed ""Cookie"" by her father, and her sister Jenny were two bright, energetic, and endearing teenagers. When their parents decide to go on the road with a carnival they are left in the care of Gertrude Baniszewski, a single mother with seven children who is constantly sick and battling with depression.The real life story of Sylvia is one that will forever haunt me. When police found her body on October 26, she had been burned with cigarettes and matches over a hundred times, beaten on a daily basis by a host of neighborhood kids from 11 to 18 years of age, starved, forced to eat her own feces, and a host of other atrocities that I cannot repeat here. But by far the worst torment she endured was a brand across her chest made with a hot piece of metal that said ""I am a prostitute and proud of it."" Sylvia, only sixteen at the time of these tortures, was killed in one of the most horrendous fashions imaginable.So, which film, An American Crime or The Girl Next Door, is truly the better film?When it comes to staying true to the original story An American Crime comes out on top. None of the tortures depicted in this film are fictional, they all happened, none of the characters made up, and only a few events fictionalized to make the story seem more dramatic. The problem I had with this film, however, is that it's really tame compared to The Girl Next Door and the actual events. Sure, everything here actually happened, but there are a host of other atrocities that are either skipped over or mentioned only in passing. Some of Sylvia's tormenters are given a free pass in this film, their own actions glazed over giving them a by that they clearly did not deserve. Paula was not the reluctant friends she is portrayed as in the film; she was one of the ringleaders of the abuse and often bragged about how badly she would beat Sylvia .In the film there is a specific scene when, at a church picnic, she was asked by an adult how she broker her wrist, to which Paula replied, ""I lost my temper with Sylvia, she's been doing some terrible things and I've had to be strict with her.""In real life a neighbor had come over to the Baniszewski house to pick up some laundry. When she noticed Sylvia in the corner badly beat up and bruised, she asked Paula about it. Paula only smiled and bragged that she'd given Sylvia those bruises, ""hit her so hard I broke my wrist."" The neighbor, of course, never reported this comment. Sylvia was dead a month later.I thought, before reviewing the case for myself, that this film was exaggerated. It is not, in fact its incredibly tame considering the source material. If you think the film is gut retching, I dare you to actually review the case. Just the bare facts were enough to bring me to tears. This movie doesn't even scratch the surface of these people's crimes and the pain Sylvia must have endured.But the worst complaint I have about this films is not its overly tame nature, it's the horrendous script and reliance on cheap Hollywood tricks that were, frankly, unneeded and violated the integrity of the film. This movie has nothing if it lacks realism, but inserted to the film throughout are many Hollywood tricks created to make the film seem more ""dramatic"" and ""faster paced."" Trust me; there is no need for any of that if you stick to the source material. The music is the first thing I noticed. It's loud, obnoxious, and distracting. There was simply no need for it a lot of the time. The films content can stand on its own two legs without us needing to hear overly dramatic music glaring in our ears.Spaoiler.Also, the whole ""dead girl narrating her own death"" subplot really undermines the realism of this film. She's dead; she can't narrate her story, and having her drift around as a ghost witnessing her own death and visiting those who killed her in prison didn't work for this films favor either. But the one part that infuriated me the most was the fake escape scene where Sylvia actually escapes convinces one of her tormenters to take her to her parents, and returns only to find that she never escaped at all, she died and is now wandering around like a ghost. In reality, Sylvia when she learned that Gertrude was planning on dumping her in nearby woods, did try to escape. She was caught, beaten until she passed out, and thrown back into the basement where shortly thereafter she died. The whole scene tanked the films credibility, in my opinion. Instead of staying true to the story and showing the death of Sylvia as it ACTULLY happened, they use smoke and mirrors to try to make the actual death even sadder. But they forgot one thing, YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ANY SADDER THEN IT REALLY WAS! The real life case is probably the most heartbreaking story ever told, why rely on these smoke and mirror tactics? The mind boggles.A film like this needs realism and great acting. It struck out on the realism, but hit a home run with the acting. Since seeing Juno I have been a fan of Ellen Page, who plays Sylvia in this film. Page is, in my opinion, the BEST young actress in the business today, bar none. Every role she touches turns to gold, and her portrayal of Sylvia is far superior to Blythe Auffarth's (Meg in The Girl Next Door) portrayal of the same character. Sylvia is played perfectly by Page, who expresses the emotions and pain that Sylvia went through in horrific detail. Although the actual torture scenes were tame in comparison to The Girl Next Door and the actual events, Page made them almost unbearable all the same. At one point I actually had to stop watching the film. Page was obviously the better actress, but another reason this portrayal of Sylvia is superior to The Girl Next Door is because Page looks much younger then did Auffarth. Although she's playing a sixteen year old girl, she looks like she's thirteen. She's also a lot more passive then Auffarth's character, and takes the tortures and punishments with hardly a word of defiance or pleading.In addition to the stunning job Page did, her co star, Catherine Keener Gertrude Baniszewski was also a home run. She wasn't simply crazy and moralistic like Ruth was in TGND, she was a struggling single mother of seven who took her anger and frustration over not being able to care or her children out on an innocent girl. She's more human, which makes her character all the more terrifying. She's not insane in the same way Ruth is (although she is still insane, just not in the same way), she isn't just punishing bad behavior as she sees it, she actually believe she's protecting her kids from the ""bad influence"" Sylvia has on them, although Sylvia never (the film and real life) actually committed any of the sins they claimed she did. Everything she does she does to protect her kids, but as we see in the end, she was really only protecting herself.So I'm going to have to recommend The Girl Next Door over this film. Although TGND does add a few things to the story that weren't true, messes around with the characters, and has its own problem with an overly Hollywoodized ending, it is still the better of the two films and is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. Put Page and Catherine Keener in that film and we'd have one of the best films of all time. An American Crime just doesn't hold the same power, and commits far too many mistakes of its own.Replay value; low.",3,"It started as a white lie, and ended as the worst crime in Indiana history.

1156392,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B00177YA6U,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[1, 1]","I admit I am biased since (at the time) I lived in a town where this story was on the front page of the paper long after it disappeared from national daily coverage. Each detail of the crime was described in the paper and (later) in a book about the very real murder of Sylvia Likens. Her parents left her with Gertrude Baniszewski when they left to work as carnival workers and didn't want to take their daughter along. Baniszewski seemed safe enough as a babysitter for their daughter and the parents did not foresee her true nature. In fact, one of the more puzzling aspects of this crime is why Baniszewski singled out Sylvia to torture, particularly since the parents were expected to return - in time.In real life, in spite of the very sadistic torture of Sylvia, Baniszewski was later considered ""reformed"" and eventually released from prison. I am skeptical of accounts of her ""reformation"", particularly in light of the prolonged torture of Sylvia. That is why I have issues with the film, one which doesn't seem to delve into the reasons why one person (Sylvia) can be made a scapegoat for all the tensions and anger in another person's life (Baniszewski). It is also hard to understand how she got so many seemingly ""average"" teens to participate in the torture. At least, they were sometimes described as average at the time, in the mid 60s.Ellen Page and Catherine Keener are superb but if you can't stand to watch unpleasant and graphic cruelty you should avoid this film. What happened to Sylvia was nearly beyond belief at the time and stunned the nation. That may seem hard to believe now, especially when the media reports about 9 and 10 year olds who have shot or killed parents or classmates. But the Sylvia Likens case was absolutely shocking in the 1960s - and continues to be so to those of us who remember when it happened.I wish the movie had provided more clues about the reasons WHY this crime happened, deeper pyschological profiles of the participants. To be fair, however, newspaper and television accounts right after Likens torture didn't provide any real motivation for the crime. Theories were bandied about but were taken seriously much later and even those theories were often speculation. There was talk of ""crowd mentality"" and the control Baniziewski had over her children and even neighborhood children.People questioned why so many of the participants kept quiet or didn't feel guilty enough to tell on Gertrude. Again, experts have weighed in on that but of course they didn't grow up in the Baniszewski household so any psychological analysis goes only so far.

A stressed out mother of 6 kids takes in two sisters to board for $20 a weekwhile her parents travel the carny circuit.  The mother is unbalanced, due to financial problems, personal illness,as well as the stress of all the kids she has.  Shecomes to believe one of the sisters (Sylvia Likens -- real name --, the elder sister)is causing trouble, and spreading rumors about her eldest daughter (which is not true).  Sheproceeds to begin to punish Sylvia in horrible ways -- burning her with cigarettes, slapping and punching her, and finally relegatesher to the basement.  While in the basement, she continues to torture, starve and beat Sylvia, and invites her children, as well as neighborhood kids, to do the same.  Sylvia's sister, Jenny, is a year younger and too paralyzed by fear to be able to help Sylvia.Ultimately, Sylvia is killed by all this abuse, the mother (and several others, including some of her children and some of the neighborhood kids were also convicted of lesser charges)is convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life, but is paroled after 15 or 20 years (it was unclear which) for good behavior.

1156408,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B00177YA6U,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[3, 5]","An American Crime is a film that attempts to tackle the grizzly horrors of the 1965 murder of Sylvia Likens. For those of you who are not familiar with the actual case, sylvia Likens was a 16 year old girl that was tortured to death under the control of a 37 year old woman named Gertrude Baniszewski. Gertrude was paid by Sylvia's parents to care for her and her handicapped 15 year old sister Jenny Likens. What makes this case even more shocking and surreal is that not only did Gertrude take part in the torture herself, but she also managed to orchestrate an atmosphere in which her own kids along with various other neighborhood children took part in the abuse of Sylvia Likens willingly. What started out as some rather severe punishment, soon escalated into such extreme illegal abuse that Sylvia was subsequently imprisoned in the Baniszewski family cellar so that she wouldn't escape and go tell the athorities. In her time of torture in the Baniszewski house, Sylvia was pushed down staircases repetitively, bathed in scalding hot water, had lit cigarettes put out all over her body, and had the words "" I'm a prostitute and proud of it"" carved into her belly along with a grotesque number 3. Other acts of sickening barbarity included being tortured in various sexual ways, being hosed off with cold water when she soiled herself, being beaten, punched, kicked, and flipped over the backs of other kids Judo style. Eventually she was left tied up in the cellar, unfed and filthy, which caused her to become weak and feverish, while at the same time, her multitude of open sores became infected. As for Sylvia's little sister Jenny, she was successfully presured into keeping her mouth shut and looking the other way by the threat of suffering the same consequences herself. Though there are no fathomable excuses as to how or why a collective group of people could find it in themselves to take their frustrations out on a captive slave for months on end without ever once giving in to their own conscience, the actual motive seems to stem from jealousy. Gertrude Baniszewski resented Sylvia Likens for being prettier and purer then herself and her own 17 year old daughter Paula Baniszewski. This resentment turned into one of the most horrific crimes in American history.The very nature of this story presents any film maker brave enough to tackle it with quite the paradox. It is not just the torture that makes this story very problematic in our highly prudish society, but the fact that the participants were all underaged children outside of Gertrude herself. Naturally there would be a reluctance to delve too deeply into the brutalility for fear of not achieving that highly coveted R rating from the MPAA. Yet the abuse and torture has to be shown in some believable way since it is the very power that guides this story. To candy coat these atrocities too much would in effect neuter the film of its edge. Also, the film makers are being asked to depict physical abuse in what is the most subjective of all mediums. It is very tricky business to depict physical abuse on film because it is all too easy to turn what was meant to be shocking and horrific into an unplanned all out laugh riot. It's a delicate balance of tactful story telling made all the more precarious since it forces the film makers to be brave enough to take some real chances.No guts, no glory.Instead of tackling this tantilizing conundrum head on, writer and director Tommy O'Haven decided to smooth over the brunt force of the more visceral aspects of this story as much as he possibly could. In order to do so, he used three different techniques as buffers against the impact that an actual blow by blow account of this case would of had on an audience. One technique was the use of a rather gimmicky surprise ending that suffice to say, was clunky at best and deserving of little more then a sigh of contempt from any movie patron worth their weight in sophistication. Another technique was the use of voice overs in the beginning and end of the film by Ellen Page. This too seemed rather gimmicky in that it was barrowed a bit too directly from American Beauty, and served only to invoke a forced responce of manipulated sadness from the audience at the appropriate time in the movie. In the beginning of the film, Ellen Page's voice over tells us how much she loves to go to the carnival and ride the merry go round even though she knows that she is far too old for it. She says that she likes to ride it because it makes her feel safe. At the end of the film there is another voice over, presumably now from Sylvia Likens ghost which plays over the top of an image of Ellen Page riding a lit up merry go round at night in an abandoned carnival. Ellen Page has this sad forlorn expression etched onto her pretty face, as she hugs the pole of her merry go round horse while traveling round and round, lost and alone.""As for me I returned to the carnival."" Her ghost is saying over this tearful image, ""The one place I always felt safe.""I know that syrup like this works on a lot of people, but if you ask me, syrup only catches flies.Flashback to the Future.The most over used technique in An American Crime was the use of flash backs. There are so many flash backs in this film, that Martin Scorsese would be rolling over in his grave if he wasn't still alive. This is a technique that if not handled carefully, only manages to become intrusive to the impact of a scene. In An American Crime, these flash backs pop up every time the abuse escalates and the film starts to become good and intense. One moment we are heading into a shocking situation in which there is no escape, the next, we are jolted into the safe controlled confines of the court proceedings that are taking place in the future. In one three minute long sequence of abuse, this technique was used no less then 11 times. These continual interruptions only succed in killing the power of the moment. It is not unlike catching a fish, but instead of reeling it in, you cut the line as soon as you get one on the hook. The question I would have to ask Tommy O'haven is, why make a film about this kind of subject matter if you are too scared to actually let the audience experience the power of the story uninterrupeted in the first place? He is only defeating the purpose by constantly pulling the chicken switch every time things start to become a bit hairy.An American Crime's ill attempted crucifix masturbation scene.Another film that is plagiorized by An American Crime is The Exorcist by William Friedkin. Now inless you have been living in a cave for the past 35 years, you will undoubtedly know that the crucifix masturbation scene in The Exorcist is easily one of the most infamous moments ever to be captured on film. An American Crime tried to have its own all powerful infamous moment too, in what was meant to be its five star super delux shocker scene. Yet, instead of designing this scene in an entirely original way, Tommy O'Haven chose to use the crucifix masturbation scene in The Exorcist as an exact blueprint to try to achieve success with his own big moment.The big scene in An American Crime is the bottle rape scene, its sequence of action plays out in this order.1- First we see the bottle, then Sylvia is ordered to insert it into herself by Gertrude, Sylvia says that she can't, and Gertrude tells her that she is not trying hard enough.2- The front door opens and two teenagers enter the living room, all so we can see their once happy exuberant faces change into reaction shots of shock and amazement.3- We see what was meant to be Sylvia inserting the bottle into herself and the immediate melee that fallows.4- Gertrude orders the bigger kids in the room to place Sylvia in the cellar, they drag her there resisting and struggling.5- This shocking moment is capped off when two big kids shove Sylvia in the back, sending her flying down the cellar staircase.The crucifix masturbation scene in The Exorcist plays out in this order.1- Regan's mother hears the demon yelling at her daughter to ""Do it"" from the upstairs bedroom. You can also hear Regan trying to resist. Regan's mother runs upstairs.2- Regan's mother throws open the bedroom door, and before we get to see the horror that awaits inside that room, we first see her mothers reaction shots.3- We then see the crucifix masturbation scene in all its glory, and the very violent melee that fallows.4- Regan's mother sees her only chance of escaping the bedroom thwarted when the furniture begins to move by telekenitic power, which sends Regan's mother scurrying out of the way of an approaching  dresser on all fours.5- This shocking moment is capped off when Regan spins her head around backwards.Thank you MR. Friedkin.Unfortunately for Tommy O'Haven, the similarities between these two scenes ends there, for unlike the amazingly crafted and perfected moment of ultimate shock in The Exorcist, the bottle rape scene in An American Crime plays as little more then a futile display of cinematic faux pas. Like every other threatening moment in An American Crime, once the situation starts to venture down the dark alleys of real subversive horror, a flash forward is immediatley inserted which takes the viewer right out of the path of any real danger, and into the sterile safty net of the court room. This happens immediately after we see the empty coke bottle. Faster then you can say ""Cop Out"", a flash forward is inserted, placing the viewer in the court proceedings where a little girl is being cross examined by the DA. As the little girl starts to tell the DA what Gertrude wanted Sylvia to do with the bottle, we are returned back to the bottle rape scene. Only now, the audio from the court proceedings plays over the top of the bottle rape scene as a kind of voice over explaining the action rather then just allowing us to see it for ourselves. The only time that we actually do hear the participants in the scene actually speak is when Sylvia says. ""I can't."" And Gertrude sternly replies. ""I don't think you're trying hard enough"".Now imagine if this silly ploy was used during the infamous crucifix masturbation scene in The Exorcist. I can picture it now, Regan's mother would be in a therapy session sometime in the future, she would be lying on her shrink's sofa as the shrink asks.""Now Miss MacNeil, what did your daughter say next?""The camera would then pan down Regan's demonic face to her cruel twisted mouth, as we hear her mothers diembodied voice explaing over the image.""Well you see, she wouldn't stop attacking herself with that crucifix you know, and um, she kept saying over and over...""Then Regan's demon voice would yell out the infamous line.""Let Jesus blank you, let Jesus blank you!!""I don't know about the rest of you, but I would like to take a moment to personally thank director William Friedkin for steering clear of such horrendous choices in cutting together that infamous scene.""Thank you MR. Friedkin.""So much for the laws of physics.When we actually do see the three images that constitute the bottle rape scene, they leave an awful lot to be desired. The first image is a very wide master shot that shows the entire living room. All the children are lined up with Gertrude to witness the forced debauchery take place. Ellen Page is seen from the back at such an angle, that we do not see her left arm at all, and we only see her right arm down to the elbow. Her hands, and the bottle are completely hidden from our view by her body. From that angle it is possible that all Ellen Page is really doing is letting out a groan while bending a bit at the waist. Since her hands are hidden from our view, one can even make the case that she isn't even holding the bottle at all during that shot. On top of this, her knee lenth skirt isn't even pulled up one iota, making the implied activity a virtual physical impossibility. Next shot, we see the bottle shatter on the hardwood floor. This too looks suspect because the glass is far too thin to be that of an old fashioned coke bottle. It looks far more like someone just dropped a juice glass between Ellen Page's feet. Now, not only would an old fashioned coke bottle not brake if dropped from a hight of less then three feet onto a hardwood floor, but the shattering of the glass is only a deceptive device used to take the viewers attention away from the fact that all the power has already been gutlessly siphoned right out of the scene. The final image is of Ellen Page landing on a sofa in sitting position with a grimace on her face. Talk about handling the difficulties of a tough scene with kids gloves on, these images look far more like something one would expect to find in an afterschool special rather then a powerful R rated drama about the horrors and trauma of gross physical abuse. No wonder Tommy O'Haven chose to have these depictions explained to us by some clumsy futuristic court proceeding insert rather then letting the images themselves provide the necessary information. Without a verbal description, there would be no way of actually knowing what had just taken place.Yet the real icing on this lilly livered cake is when Ellen Page is shoved down the staircase. We never get to see the stairs, or anyone tumbling down them. All we are shown is a computer generated black void taking up the empty doorway to the cellar, and Ellen Page diving into the pitch darkness going. ""AAAAaaaaaaahhhhh!!""Outside of being flat out funny looking, the musical score that was meant to imply the dread, disgust, and shock that we were suppose to feel during this Earth shattering moment, sounds far more suited for the film Killer Clowns From Outerspace. Thanks to An American Crime, I now know what Guinness feels like coming out of my nose.I know that the one arguement that can be made about my critism of this film is that of social responsibility. Lovers of this film can always say that Tommy O'Haven chose to candy coat the atrocities because he is just showing sound social values with his tact and restraint. But in all honesty, when a scene calls for a 17 year old girl to slug a 16 year old girl so hard in the face that she fractures her fist in the process, I want it to look like something more then a hissy fit slap fight between two toddlers. The fact remains that the Sylvia Likens story pushes the very fabric of social decency anyway, so what it really needed was a gutsy director willing to take risks, not Tommy O'Haven whose approach was to pussyfoot.",3,Pussyfoot.,1222905600,"10 2, 2008",2008,14534,"['American', 'Crime', 'film', 'tackle', 'grizzly', 'horrors', '1965', 'murder', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar',

1156410,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B00177YA6U,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[1, 1]","This film based on an actual event of the worst child abuse case in history is pretty upseting and disturbing. And if I had seen this film first I would have been spared the agony of seeing the other film based on the same event of child abuse entitled 'The girl next door'. That film was based on Jack Ketchum's book which tells a much more sick and twisted version of the story. And that film is absolutely the most horrifying and disturbing movie I have ever seen. It is brutal and discusting to an unbearable level. It makes movies like Hostel and Cannibal Holocaust seem somehow like childs play. This film on the other hand tells the story in a more accurate version because it is based on the actual court records of the case, and this film explains how it really happened. In both films an innocent girl is tortured for months in the basement of a small neighborhood house until she dies from the ordeal. Both films show the sad factual realities of how kids from the neighborhood (and even the children of the woman held responsible for the horrible ordeal) participated in torturing the young girl as she lay helpless to do anything about it.

1156412,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00177YA6U,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","An American Crime (Tommy O'Haver, 2007)O'Haver takes a left turn and goes way out into the field for his sixth feature film. The director of such light, family-friendly (well, depending on your family) fare as Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss and Ella Enchanted takes on the Likens case, examination of which has expereinced something of a renaissance since the re-release of Jack Ketchum's Likens-based novel The Girl Next Door (which was also made into a film recently) a few years ago.In case you've missed the flap, here's a quick rundown: Sylvia (Juno's Ellen Page) and Jennie (Ring Around the Rosie's Hayley McFarland) Likens are left by their parents in the care of Gertrude Baniszewski (Being John Malkovich's Catherine Keener), a woman who's slick and likable on the outside, but dangerously unstable on the inside. When the girls' parents are late with their board check, Gertrude takes it out on Sylvia. The punishment escalates into one of the most horrific crimes in American history, an almost unbelievable combination of mass hysteria and Stockholm Syndrome that eventually had almost all of the neighborhood's kids committing the worst kind of degradations, with Sylvia Likens as a combination punching bag and sex toy. Of course, nothing good can come of this.While it's certainly possible that the very subject matter alone will turn viewers off, it should be noted that as far as actual onscreen violence, An American Crime is not nearly as graphic as The Girl Next Door; much of what happens is suggested but never shown (instead, the camera cuts away and we're left with our imaginations or muffled sound effects heard from outside the house). This is definitely not a movie for gorehounds. O'Haver plays it more as a psychological drama/thriller, focusing on the paradoxical relationship between Baniszewski and Likens, where Baniszewski is as apt to be on her knees begging Sylvia for forgiveness as she is burning her with a cigarette. Because of this, the film is made or broken by the performances of Keener and Page, both of whom shine here-- this is by far Page's best acting moment since Hard Candy, and I'm not sure Keener has ever been this good. The two of them are backed up by a strong supporting cast including Scout Taylor-Compton, Ari Gaynor, Brian Geraghty, and Bradley Whitford, among others, who turn in good performances while allowing Page and Keener to steal the show.An incredible piece of work, one of the ten best movies I've seen this year. ****",4,Stunning.,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2489,"['American', 'Crime', 'Tommy', ""O'Haver"", '2007', ""O'Haver"", 'left', 'turn', 'way', 'field', 'sixth', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'such', 'light', 'family-friendly', 'well', 'depending', 'family', 'fare', 'Billy', 'Hollywood', 'Screen', 'Kiss', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'Likens', 'case', 'examination', 'expereinced', 'something', 'renaissance', 're-release', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'Likens-based', 'novel', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'film', 'recently', 'few', 'years', 'ago.In', 'case', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'flap', 'here', 'quick', 'rundown', 'Sylvia', 'Juno', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Jennie', 'Ring', 'Rosie', 'Hayley', 'McFarland', 'Likens', 'are', 'left', 'parents', 'care', 'Gertrude', 'Baniszewski', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'woman', 'who', 'slick', 'likable', 'outside', 'dangerously', 'unstable', 'inside', 'When', 'girls', 'parents', 'are', 'late', 'board', 'check', 'Gertrude', 'out', 'Sylvia', 'punishment', 'one', 'most', 'horrific', 'crimes', 'American', 'history', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'combination', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome', 'eventually', 'had', 'almost', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'committing', 'worst', 'kind', 'degradations', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'combination', 'punching', 'bag', 'sex', 'toy', 'course', 'nothing', 'good', 'can', 'come', 'this.While', 'certainly', 'possible', 'very', 'subject', 'matter', 'alone', 'will', 'turn', 'viewers', 'off', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'as', 'far', 'actual', 'onscreen', 'violence', 'American', 'Crime', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'graphic', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'much', 'what', 'suggested', 'never', 'shown', 'instead', 'camera', 'away', ""'re"", 'left', 'imaginations', 'muffled', 'sound', 'effects', 'heard', 'house', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'gorehounds', ""O'Haver"", 'more', 'psychological', 'drama/thriller', 'focusing', 'paradoxical', 'relationship', 'Baniszewski', 'Likens', 'where', 'Baniszewski', 'as', 'apt', 'be', 'knees', 'begging', 'Sylvia', 'forgiveness', 'burning', 'cigarette', 'film', 'made', 'broken', 'performances', 'Keener', 'Page', 'whom', 'shine', 'here', 'far', 'Page', 'best', 'acting', 'moment', 'Hard', 'Candy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Keener', 'ever', 'been', 'good', 'two', 'are', 'backed', 'up', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'Ari', 'Gaynor', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'others', 'who', 'turn', 'good', 'performances', 'allowing', 'Page', 'Keener', 'steal', 'show.An', 'incredible', 'piece', 'work', 'one', 'ten', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', '****']",An American Crime
1156413,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B00177YA6U,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[3, 7]","I rented five movies for a long weekend.  Breaking with my usual pattern, I rented fairly recent releases.  Three were terrible, one OK and the fifth, 'An American Crime' superb.This is anything but an upbeat film in that it is a 'true' story from the 1960's of child abuse and murder.  The acting is wonderful even if the actors are playing monsters.  The film starts with a separated couple, with two children, planning a reexploration of their relationship without he pressure of children.  They leave their two girls with a woman they barely know who already has a house full of childrenWe watch this stranger-woman as she ranges between depressive and seductive behaviors.  One of her actual daughters gets pregnant--which the woman is mentally incapable of accepting.  She believes, however, that one of her foster daughters has started the 'lie' that her actual birth-daughter is a pregant slut.  The woman undergoes progressive deterioration, punishing her foster daughter brutally for no real reason.  She beats her and burns cigarette butts into her skin.  She has one of her sons throw the hapless girl down the coal skuttle, seriously injuring her.She then manacles her foster daughter because she 'still requires punishment for being a whore.'  She invites her own children and neighborhood children to brutalize her.  They are all too cooperative and beat, kick and burn her.  They finally carve the initials on her abdomen ""I am a prostitute and proud of it.""  Her frequent agonizing screams are heard by neighbors who don't want to get involved.Basically, what is depicted is a sadomasochistic woman descending into depression and psychosis.  There is a trial and conviction.  The woman, and even her own children, are convicted of child abuse.  The woman gets life in prison but is out in twenty years for 'good behavior'.  Heartbreaking.I think this film can be viewed in a philosophical and even scientific light.  William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies' and some of Sam Peckinpah's movies emphasize their beliefs that chidren are born morally neutral and must be correctly socialized to produce 'safe', civiilized human beings.  Without such socialization children and later adults are dangerous.  In an 'An American Crime', we see an example of negative socialization.  An adult--a psychotic adult--actually gives permission for children to behave in horrific ways. Not surprisingly, just as the marooned children in 'Lord of the Flies', the children engage in barbarous behaviors.A corollary to this is that the potential for monstrous behavior is just beneath the skin of many of us which probably explains certain otherwise inexplicable individual crimes and mass political/governmental crimes where 'permission' from the highest levels.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",5,"an excruciationg tale, beautifully done",1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,2862,"['rented', 'five', 'movies', 'long', 'weekend', 'Breaking', 'usual', 'pattern', 'rented', 'fairly', 'recent', 'releases', 'Three', 'were', 'terrible', 'one', 'OK', 'fifth', 'American', 'Crime', 'superb.This', 'anything', 'upbeat', 'film', ""'true"", 'story', '1960', 'child', 'abuse', 'murder', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'even', 'actors', 'are', 'playing', 'monsters', 'film', 'separated', 'couple', 'two', 'children', 'planning', 'reexploration', 'relationship', 'pressure', 'children', 'leave', 'two', 'girls', 'woman', 'barely', 'know', 'who', 'already', 'house', 'full', 'childrenWe', 'watch', 'stranger-woman', 'depressive', 'seductive', 'behaviors', 'One', 'actual', 'daughters', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'mentally', 'incapable', 'accepting', 'however', 'one', 'foster', 'daughters', 'started', ""'lie"", 'actual', 'birth-daughter', 'pregant', 'slut', 'woman', 'progressive', 'deterioration', 'punishing', 'foster', 'daughter', 'brutally', 'real', 'reason', 'burns', 'cigarette', 'butts', 'skin', 'one', 'sons', 'throw', 'hapless', 'girl', 'coal', 'skuttle', 'seriously', 'injuring', 'her.She', 'then', 'foster', 'daughter', 'punishment', 'being', 'whore', 'own', 'children', 'neighborhood', 'children', 'brutalize', 'are', 'too', 'cooperative', 'beat', 'kick', 'burn', 'finally', 'carve', 'initials', 'abdomen', 'am', 'prostitute', 'proud', 'frequent', 'agonizing', 'screams', 'are', 'heard', 'neighbors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'involved.Basically', 'what', 'depicted', 'sadomasochistic', 'woman', 'descending', 'depression', 'psychosis', 'trial', 'conviction', 'woman', 'even', 'own', 'children', 'are', 'convicted', 'child', 'abuse', 'woman', 'life', 'prison', 'out', 'twenty', 'years', ""'good"", 'behavior', 'Heartbreaking.I', 'think', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'philosophical', 'even', 'scientific', 'light', 'William', 'Golding', ""'Lord"", 'Flies', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'movies', 'emphasize', 'beliefs', 'chidren', 'are', 'born', 'morally', 'neutral', 'must', 'be', 'correctly', 'socialized', 'produce', ""'safe"", 'civiilized', 'human', 'beings', 'such', 'socialization', 'children', 'later', 'adults', 'are', 'dangerous', ""'An"", 'American', 'Crime', 'see', 'example', 'negative', 'socialization', 'adult', 'psychotic', 'adult', 'actually', 'permission', 'children', 'behave', 'horrific', 'ways', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'just', 'marooned', 'children', ""'Lord"", 'Flies', 'children', 'engage', 'barbarous', 'behaviors.A', 'corollary', 'potential', 'monstrous', 'behavior', 'just', 'skin', 'many', 'probably', 'certain', 'otherwise', 'inexplicable', 'individual', 'crimes', 'mass', 'political/governmental', 'crimes', 'where', ""'permission"", 'highest', 'levels.Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'novels', 'Skull', 'Rack', 'Hummingbird', 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",An American Crime
1156414,A3BAOIC7JMCY6R,B00177YA6U,"RPK ""Professional Shark Tamer""","[3, 4]","An American Crime is one of the few films I have seen recently to enrage and unsettle me. The film recalls the shocking events that have made for one of America's most disturbing crimes. Ellen Paige stars as Sylvia Likens, a pretty, shy girl, who along with her sister, wind up boarding with a mentally unstable woman named Gertrude Baniszewski(the ever so talented Catherine Keener) and her six children. The events that follow through the film take place over a three month period of time and the movie flows back and forth from the trial of Gertrude to the dates of the actual torturings that inevitably caused the death of 16 year old Sylvia.The story is shocking. It is incredibly disturbing not so much for the things that were done to Sylvia, but for the fact that the majority of the crimes committed were done by mere children. Gertrude laid the foundations down for Sylvia's demise, but the children physically did the killing. It's a very unsettling look at people and there ability to turn the other cheek at neighborhood crimes that take place. People would rather look away then get involved in something that could cause them distress, and in this case, three months of torture leading to a young girls death. It's amazing how the people in the community just ignored the screaming and stories there own children (who had just returned from beating Sylvia) would tell them about The Baniszewski family. Very very disturbing. But, it also might have just been that era. The sexual revolution was barely taking place yet so this was just a different time to be a child.The film itself is a somewhat accurate depiction of Sylvia's story. It is narrarated by the deceased Liken girl, which is in itself an incredibly sad homage to her. The film makers seemed to play more on the mood and tension of the scenes rather than going for gore or getting too involved in the actual heinous acts. But, I feel like more could have been done to show what happened to Sylvia. Something was lacking in that regard, which left me unhappy. They didn't seem to convey the desperation in Sylvia's outward appearance as much as they should have. In her final moments she looked almost spotless, as if she had never been beaten at all, which was obviously untrue.Overall, The movie left me very sad and shocked. I have read about this story in the past after coming across a book by Jack Ketchum that retold the story. I did a little internet research about two years ago on Sylvia and found the story compelling and incredibly gripping.",3,An American Crime ***Spoilers***,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,2530,"['American', 'Crime', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'enrage', 'unsettle', 'film', 'shocking', 'events', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'disturbing', 'crimes', 'Ellen', 'Paige', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'pretty', 'shy', 'girl', 'who', 'sister', 'wind', 'up', 'boarding', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'woman', 'named', 'Gertrude', 'Baniszewski', 'ever', 'so', 'talented', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'six', 'children', 'events', 'follow', 'film', 'take', 'place', 'three', 'month', 'period', 'time', 'movie', 'back', 'forth', 'trial', 'Gertrude', 'dates', 'actual', 'torturings', 'inevitably', 'caused', 'death', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Sylvia.The', 'story', 'shocking', 'incredibly', 'disturbing', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'Sylvia', 'fact', 'majority', 'crimes', 'committed', 'were', 'done', 'mere', 'children', 'Gertrude', 'laid', 'foundations', 'down', 'Sylvia', 'demise', 'children', 'physically', 'did', 'killing', 'very', 'unsettling', 'look', 'people', 'ability', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek', 'neighborhood', 'crimes', 'take', 'place', 'People', 'would', 'rather', 'look', 'away', 'then', 'get', 'involved', 'something', 'could', 'cause', 'distress', 'case', 'three', 'months', 'torture', 'leading', 'young', 'girls', 'death', 'amazing', 'how', 'people', 'community', 'just', 'ignored', 'screaming', 'stories', 'there', 'own', 'children', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'returned', 'beating', 'Sylvia', 'would', 'tell', 'Baniszewski', 'family', 'Very', 'very', 'disturbing', 'also', 'might', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'era', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'was', 'barely', 'taking', 'place', 'yet', 'so', 'was', 'just', 'different', 'time', 'be', 'child.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'Sylvia', 'story', 'narrarated', 'deceased', 'Liken', 'girl', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'homage', 'film', 'makers', 'seemed', 'play', 'more', 'mood', 'tension', 'scenes', 'rather', 'going', 'gore', 'getting', 'too', 'involved', 'actual', 'heinous', 'acts', 'feel', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'Sylvia', 'Something', 'was', 'lacking', 'regard', 'left', 'unhappy', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'convey', 'desperation', 'Sylvia', 'outward', 'appearance', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'final', 'moments', 'looked', 'almost', 'spotless', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'beaten', 'was', 'obviously', 'untrue.Overall', 'movie', 'left', 'very', 'sad', 'shocked', 'have', 'read', 'story', 'past', 'coming', 'book', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'retold', 'story', 'did', 'little', 'internet', 'research', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'Sylvia', 'found', 'story', 'compelling', 'incredibly', 'gripping']",An American Crime
1156415,A387BD735MI50R,B00177YA6U,R. Schultz,"[5, 5]","This is one ""based-on-a-true-story"" movie that really matters, that is more than just a loose exploitation of some tragedy. I don't know why this movie slipped through the cracks at the box office. All its stars turn in brilliant, incisive acting jobs - including Ellen Page, the young star of ""Juno."" This movie deserved to reach a wider audience.It shows how child abuse can escalate from scathing insult to the extremes of physical cruelty. It is psychologically accurate in that it additionally shows how such abuse can sometimes be focused on just one child in a family, while other family members go relatively unscathed or else actually get enlisted to promote the cruelty.This movie doesn't attempt to fully explain how such pathology develops in a family. However it does illustrate some conditions that are frequently found where these sick dynamics develop. The victim here, along with her sister, had been temporarily adopted, so she was not the biological offspring of the abusive woman and was tacitly perceived as being a burdensome ""outsider"" from the start. Then the abusive caretaker had a lot of diffuse hostility and resentment that she needed to focus. The one slightly more free-spirited adopted sibling got the full heated rage of this hostility focused on her to the point that it erupted into flame.Other family members and friends each had complex motives for eventually conspiring with the abuse. These others were of course afraid of the abusing woman. They wanted to please her and felt relieved when they saw her rage being vented on someone else. However these other individuals also had their own floating hostilities that they wanted to anchor somewhere, on someone. All of this seemed calculated to build to a horrifying pack attack.Without loading too much freight on this one movie, it might be viewed in a larger context. You might actually find it more helpful in leading you to understand how holocausts evolve than a lot of the scholarly works written on the subject of genocide. It suggests how holocausts can be the result of a lot of vague grievance that gets manipulated into focus on one particular person or group.This is a difficult movie to watch, but very worthwhile.",4,"A Gripping, Important Film",1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,2216,"['one', 'based-on-a-true-story', 'movie', 'really', 'matters', 'more', 'just', 'loose', 'exploitation', 'tragedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'movie', 'slipped', 'cracks', 'box', 'office', 'stars', 'turn', 'brilliant', 'incisive', 'acting', 'jobs', 'including', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'young', 'star', 'Juno', 'movie', 'deserved', 'reach', 'wider', 'audience.It', 'how', 'child', 'abuse', 'can', 'escalate', 'scathing', 'insult', 'extremes', 'physical', 'cruelty', 'psychologically', 'accurate', 'additionally', 'how', 'such', 'abuse', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'focused', 'just', 'one', 'child', 'family', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'go', 'relatively', 'unscathed', 'else', 'actually', 'get', 'enlisted', 'promote', 'cruelty.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'fully', 'explain', 'how', 'such', 'pathology', 'develops', 'family', 'However', 'illustrate', 'conditions', 'are', 'frequently', 'found', 'where', 'sick', 'dynamics', 'develop', 'victim', 'here', 'sister', 'had', 'been', 'temporarily', 'adopted', 'was', 'not', 'biological', 'offspring', 'abusive', 'woman', 'was', 'tacitly', 'perceived', 'being', 'burdensome', 'outsider', 'start', 'Then', 'abusive', 'caretaker', 'had', 'lot', 'diffuse', 'hostility', 'resentment', 'needed', 'focus', 'one', 'slightly', 'more', 'free-spirited', 'adopted', 'sibling', 'got', 'full', 'heated', 'rage', 'hostility', 'focused', 'point', 'erupted', 'flame.Other', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'had', 'complex', 'motives', 'eventually', 'conspiring', 'abuse', 'others', 'were', 'course', 'afraid', 'abusing', 'woman', 'wanted', 'please', 'felt', 'relieved', 'when', 'saw', 'rage', 'being', 'vented', 'someone', 'else', 'However', 'other', 'individuals', 'also', 'had', 'own', 'floating', 'hostilities', 'wanted', 'anchor', 'somewhere', 'someone', 'seemed', 'calculated', 'build', 'horrifying', 'pack', 'loading', 'too', 'much', 'freight', 'one', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'viewed', 'larger', 'context', 'might', 'actually', 'find', 'more', 'helpful', 'leading', 'understand', 'how', 'holocausts', 'evolve', 'lot', 'scholarly', 'works', 'written', 'subject', 'genocide', 'how', 'holocausts', 'can', 'be', 'result', 'lot', 'vague', 'grievance', 'manipulated', 'focus', 'one', 'particular', 'person', 'group.This', 'difficult', 'movie', 'watch', 'very', 'worthwhile']",An American Crime

I truly feel this movie did not tell Sylvia Likens story accurately, they left out many details and I was a little upset on how they portrayed Gertrude in this. Now while I do feel some remorse for the events that transpired through Gertrude's life. I really feel this film made her seem to soft, while she did horrific acts to Sylvia and even when she did things to her, she just did not come across as the Gertrude I read about.I feel changing the events of what happened and HOW they happened, was completely wrong. I know movies can only interpet so much into film and small things will be changed.

It is about the torture and murder of Sylvia Likens, which took place in the sixties. It is one of the most horrifying crimes ever, so heartless, demonic, and cruel.

We don't spend enough time with the character beforehand, and it does hurt the story later on. We simply spent too much time with everyone else in the story.A word of warning: this film is very graphic, and is not recommended to the faint of heart. It is heartbreaking and very hard to watch.

1156424,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00177YA6U,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","In 1965, Gertrude Baniszewski, a single mother of six was asked to watch a friend children for the summer. Needing the money, Baniszewski, a mentally unstable woman, agreed but quickly decided that one of the girls, Sylvia, was a bad influence on her family. She locked Sylvia in the basement and for weeks allowed her kids and their friends to beat and rape the girl, until she finally died a month later. Baniszewski was convicted of murder and sentenced to life, but only served 14 years before being paroled. The details of the story were vividly described in Jack Ketchum's novel, The Girl Next Door, which was turned into a movie, in 2007. The film depiction of the book was wildly inaccurate and to be honest, just plain bad. Shortly after, another film was made, An American Crime. This film focuses on the case and tells the story through testimonial flashbacks, that are taken directly from the trial transcripts. This film was much better than The Girl Next Door was. As someone who has read the book and is familiar with the story, I can tell you, it was much more accurate. The story is well known and the film didn't offer up any surprises for me. The most interesting aspect for me was the cast. An American Crime features a ton of young Hollywood talent, most of whom got their big break in this film, and went on to bigger and better things. The film features the likes of Ellen Page, James Franco, Jeremy Sumpter, Evan Peters, Michael Welch, and a ton of other people who went on to much bigger roles. What was really interesting was seeing all this talent right at the very start of their careers. Knowing the details and knowing what was going to happen, I focused more on the performances than the film. Catherine Keener plays Gertrude and how she didn't win an award for the portrayal is beyond me. Keener was terrific in a very difficult role. She was probably one of the only people who could have pulled it off. Sylvia was played by Ellen Page, who of course later went on to become Juno. She was equally good, especially when you consider that she'd done almost nothing prior to taking this role. The story told in An American Crime is not for those with a weak stomach, it is violent and unbelievable, but it happened, and I'm glad that a second filmmaker took on the task of honoring Sylvia's memory by telling her story accurately, while at the same time giving a young cast the chance to prove themselves.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,2435,"['1965', 'Gertrude', 'Baniszewski', 'single', 'mother', 'six', 'was', 'asked', 'watch', 'friend', 'children', 'summer', 'Needing', 'money', 'Baniszewski', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'woman', 'agreed', 'quickly', 'decided', 'one', 'girls', 'Sylvia', 'was', 'bad', 'influence', 'family', 'locked', 'Sylvia', 'basement', 'weeks', 'allowed', 'kids', 'friends', 'beat', 'rape', 'girl', 'finally', 'died', 'month', 'later', 'Baniszewski', 'was', 'convicted', 'murder', 'sentenced', 'life', 'only', 'served', '14', 'years', 'being', 'paroled', 'details', 'story', 'were', 'vividly', 'described', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'novel', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'was', 'turned', 'movie', '2007', 'film', 'depiction', 'book', 'was', 'wildly', 'inaccurate', 'be', 'honest', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Shortly', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'American', 'Crime', 'film', 'case', 'story', 'testimonial', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'taken', 'directly', 'trial', 'transcripts', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'familiar', 'story', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'accurate', 'story', 'well', 'known', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'up', 'surprises', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'was', 'cast', 'American', 'Crime', 'ton', 'young', 'Hollywood', 'talent', 'most', 'whom', 'got', 'big', 'break', 'film', 'went', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'film', 'likes', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'James', 'Franco', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'Michael', 'Welch', 'ton', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'went', 'much', 'bigger', 'roles', 'What', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'was', 'seeing', 'talent', 'right', 'very', 'start', 'careers', 'Knowing', 'details', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'focused', 'more', 'performances', 'film', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Gertrude', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'award', 'portrayal', 'Keener', 'was', 'terrific', 'very', 'difficult', 'role', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'Sylvia', 'was', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'who', 'course', 'later', 'went', 'become', 'Juno', 'was', 'equally', 'good', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', ""'d"", 'done', 'almost', 'nothing', 'prior', 'taking', 'role', 'story', 'told', 'American', 'Crime', 'not', 'weak', 'stomach', 'violent', 'unbelievable', 'happened', ""'m"", 'glad', 'second', 'filmmaker', 'took', 'task', 'honoring', 'Sylvia', 'memory', 'telling', 'story', 'accurately', 'same', 'time', 'giving', 'young', 'cast', 'chance', 'prove']",An American Crime

In this Part, Ellen Page Is Brilliant as The Tragic True Life Character named Sylvia and watching her performance made me realise that she was on her way to stardom even when she was still an unknown actress. When Reviewing Films, I dont like to give to much information away especially for a film like this that is baes on a true story. I had actually never even heard of this case before I saw the film which is weird because this case definatley is BY FAR the most shocking child abuse case I have ever heard of. After watching the film, I just cant forget about it(wish I could). I looked up the actual case(tons of info on the internet) and as shocking and horrifying as the film is(we are talking coke bottles and branding here), the case was MUCH WORSE than even the film could portray(if the film had literally filmed it the way it all happened, it would have been rated X for Exteme violence). Prisoners of War are treated better than this girl was treated. The One thing that I found really shocking and repulsive was it wasnt just one person who was doing the torturing, it was practically the entire neighborhood of children, young teens and even young adults. Even Worse was that some of the children were actually telling their parents what was going on and they reponded with comments like ""Not Our Problem"" or ""Well She must have done Something Wrong, that is why she is Being Punished"". Neighbors who testified hearing the screams  of this poor girl actually stated in court that ""it Wasnt Our Business""! One thing that the film doesnt really delve into which bothered me is that I partially blame the parents who left their two daughters with this Monster From Hell, On The First day that the father met this Witch, she volunteered to take the girls in for $20 a month and daddy was like ""OKAY"", what parents leave their children with a total stranger? I do want to address a couple of the comments of reviews on Amazon for this film. The comments were critical of the film because the film didnt delve into the reasonson why this woman tortured this girl. I felt the same way as those reviewers UNTIL I read up on the case. According to Court Documents, NONE OF THE WITNESS'S COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION! Many of The children stated that Sylvia was a well behaved girl and didnt do anything wrong, they had no idea why their mother did these unspeakable acts, so thats why the film didnt portray that.  A Well acted Film and Steller Performances by Both Ellen page and Catherine Keanner.

1156431,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00177YA6U,Westley,"[11, 16]","Catherine Keener stars as Gertrude Baniszewski in ""An American Crime,"" which is based on the true story of a midwestern housewife who tortured and murdered a teenage girl in 1966.  Ellen Page plays the girl (Sylvia); she and her younger sister are left with Gertrude by their parents who travel the country running carnival games.  Gertrude has numerous children and seems to be rather unbalanced - flirting with neighborhood teen boys and spending a lot of time coughing and being sick.  When Sylvia has a tiff with one Gertrude's daughters, she decides that Sylvia's punishment is to be locked in the basement until she has ""learned her lesson.""  This ""lesson"" ends up lasting several months, and her children and other kids from the neighborhood join in the cruel treatment, including burning Sylvia with cigarettes.  Eventually, Sylvia dies from the mistreatment and the police arrest Keener; the trial is shown throughout the movie, with the events told in flashback.""An American Crime"" is relatively graphic; indeed, at times, it seems to wallow in the unpleasantness.  Unfortunately, the script doesn't have anything interesting to say about the crime.  It happened, it was horrible, and Gertrude and some of her children were punished - end of story.  The movie really doesn't explore explicitly how this kind of crime could happen or why so many people participated over time and said nothing.  Presumably, her children and others discussed what was happening, but we are not privy to these conversations or musings.  As a result, the movie just doesn't have much impact beyond the shock value of seeing these events occur.  A much better movie could have been made based on this story, especially with the talented Keener; this one just seems sensationalistic.  The movie didn't have to provide easy answers to explain away what happened, but it could have at least tried to explore the psyches of these people.Note: As this film has not yet been released on DVD, I based this review on a showing on cable tv.",2,Doesn't provide enough insight,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,2019,"['Catherine', 'Keener', 'Gertrude', 'Baniszewski', 'American', 'Crime', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'midwestern', 'housewife', 'who', 'tortured', 'murdered', 'teenage', 'girl', '1966', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'girl', 'Sylvia', 'younger', 'sister', 'are', 'left', 'Gertrude', 'parents', 'who', 'travel', 'country', 'running', 'carnival', 'games', 'Gertrude', 'numerous', 'children', 'be', 'rather', 'unbalanced', 'flirting', 'neighborhood', 'teen', 'boys', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'coughing', 'being', 'sick', 'When', 'Sylvia', 'tiff', 'one', 'Gertrude', 'daughters', 'Sylvia', 'punishment', 'be', 'locked', 'basement', 'learned', 'lesson', 'lesson', 'up', 'lasting', 'several', 'months', 'children', 'other', 'kids', 'neighborhood', 'join', 'cruel', 'treatment', 'including', 'burning', 'Sylvia', 'cigarettes', 'Eventually', 'Sylvia', 'mistreatment', 'police', 'arrest', 'Keener', 'trial', 'shown', 'movie', 'events', 'told', 'flashback', 'American', 'Crime', 'relatively', 'graphic', 'indeed', 'times', 'wallow', 'unpleasantness', 'Unfortunately', 'script', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'interesting', 'say', 'crime', 'happened', 'was', 'horrible', 'Gertrude', 'children', 'were', 'punished', 'end', 'story', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'explore', 'explicitly', 'how', 'kind', 'crime', 'could', 'happen', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'participated', 'time', 'said', 'nothing', 'Presumably', 'children', 'others', 'discussed', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'are', 'not', 'privy', 'conversations', 'musings', 'result', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'impact', 'shock', 'value', 'seeing', 'events', 'occur', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'based', 'story', 'especially', 'talented', 'Keener', 'one', 'just', 'sensationalistic', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'provide', 'easy', 'answers', 'explain', 'away', 'what', 'happened', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'tried', 'explore', 'psyches', 'people.Note', 'film', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'based', 'review', 'showing', 'cable', 'tv']",An American Crime
1156432,A1JMYZA3MR27WC,B00177YA6U,"Wux Iapan ""Fantas""","[4, 7]","Ok, the good things first:1: Good intention by the makers of this film to inform the world about the Likens case.2: awesome cast and production valuesNow the not so good stuff:We all probably know about the real life case. But this film is like recreating the 2nd world war and only show one dead jew whilst in reality it was about thousands of jews. It's like telling the Nazi story but leaving out the concentration camps. Like telling Hitler's story but leaving out the fact that he also was just a puppy, directed by others.In the real life (Likens) case, there were witnesses: one neighbour once made a visit and witnessed how the kids threw cups at Sylvia's head, and Gerty then told her that some specific injury on her cheek was made by her own daughter. That neighbour then anonymously contacted the social department who sent a woman to check the situation, but everyone smiled nicely, she was probably given a nice hot choccolate, and left happily, closing the case (who later was found so during the investigations). Sylvia also secretly contacted a cop, but this over-intelligent freak did the worst thinkable: he went to the house, told Gerty what he was told, and again, she probably was really friendly and nice and convinced him that Sylvia was just telling lies or something. Silvia then was imprisoned in the cellar and excused at school and church for wrong reasons.Close to the end, some neighbours couldn't get sleep because of the noise from the horror house, a noise that just didn't vanish after hours. They were about the call the cops when it suddenly stopped. One day later it was clear that the noise was made by Sylvia, trying to call for help by hitting a shovel against the cellar wall.Now ok, you can't show everything, and some infos might be the result of gossips and personal interpretations. But when you know just a bit about the case and watch this movie, you really ask yourself, WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS FILM? It's a super-light version of reality. WHY?? It could have been a really strong drama about the worst of human's conditions, but they left out a lot of meat that would have lead to further discussions and examinations. Also, the recreation of the case was FALSE. They twisted the events in a way that the LIKENS FAMILY itself is NOT HAPPY with this film, stating that it totally twisted informations and stuff. As I see it, some events were changed, twisted and left out ways too much so that it doesn't resemble the case in no way.In an interview, the director himself explained that whilst the real life case is one thing, the script is another that has to fulfill certain standarts and stuff: no repetition for example. Unfortunatly, when in the film there had been ""repeated"" visits (social worker, cop etc.), this would have shown reality, but also made the film more boring. I simply don't think so. It wasn't hundreds of visits, but enough to raise some uncomfortable conclusions that the director just didn't want to be raised.Also, I think the ending is a TOTAL, shameful MESS. O'Haver tries to go arthouse with that ending, twisting the whole situation to an unaccaptable climax (SPOILER), in which Silvia at first survives and escapes, finds her parents, convinces her to bring her back to the horror house so that she can save her sister, but her parents act a bit... questionable, as if they don't care about the situation, they're just 'there', watching her entering the house, where Silvia sees herself lying dead on the ground.
