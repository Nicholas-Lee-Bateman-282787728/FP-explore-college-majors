Well, that was until now....what in the world was Sandra thinking when she made this movie?  Was it supposed to be this bad? As bad as the script was, could they have least cast a much hotter (more masculine acting) guy in the lead role opposite Sandra? At least it would be an okay movie to see her hook up romantically with someone that was worth her beauty.*Disclaimer about Blind Side:  loved the movie, the message, and Sandra's acting....I do not like the person that she portrayed. I think Leigh Ann Tuohy is an arrogant, publicity seeking person and exploited this &#34;great act of kindness&#34; in order to obtain some noteriety.

Perhaps the character of Alyssa was not the best one for Bullock because we have a paradigm of her as a strong forceful woman.  In this movie, she played a softer more innocent part.  She followed the director's directions, and did her job well.  It seemed to me that the director ran a tight ship.  I can see it from the tone and cadence of Bullock's voice, to the way she moved.  The love making scene was also tightly directed I noticed by the way they kissed and moved.

She was absolutely lousy with some of the worse lines imaginable. Craig Sheffer plays an obnoxious reporter who has his camera in everyone's face while Bullock is an activist attempting to save the rain forest. One of the protest leaders is killed and the story becomes a very bad who-dun-it. I kept hoping for Sheffer to die, but alas that was not the case.The sole attraction of this film is the love scene between Bullock and Sheffer where she shows more skin than usual, with strategic spots missing the camera so as to not technically classify it as a nude scene per se.
