I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of FRASIER and SEINFELD - and BIG BANG is **consistently** brilliant!Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself, he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD yet (and Sheldon never lets him forget it). An electrical engineer whose crowning achievement is a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle (and is now working on its liquid waste management solutions). He also managed to wreck the Mars rover in hopes of landing a girl - but he made sure no one can prove anything.The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.Now, if only he could find a practical use for that mechanized arm...Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He keeps using the ""poor Indian"" defense although his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley.Finally, Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,A WHOLE NEW UNIVERSE OF INTELLIGENT LAUGHS!,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,2891,"['cult', 'tradition', 'SPARTACUS', 'halls', 'science', 'department', 'now', 'AM', 'SHELDON', 'Currently', 'fourth', 'season', 'THE', 'BIG', 'BANG', 'THEORY', 'proved', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'funny', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'aired', 'had', 'not', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'hard', 'ever', 'best', 'days', 'FRASIER', 'SEINFELD', 'BIG', 'BANG', '**consistently**', 'brilliant', 'Sheldon', 'Cooper', 'unavoidably', 'king', 'show', 'massive', 'black', 'hole', 'Universe', 'will', 'child', 'prodigy', 'now', '24', 'years', 'old', 'theoretical', 'physicist', 'PhD', 'absolutely', 'social', 'skills', 'known', 'sexual', 'drive', 'Sheldon', 'may', 'be', 'verge', 'unifying', 'fields', 'can', 'not', 'drive', 'car', 'save', 'life', 'break', 'smile', 'even', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'mere', 'homo', 'sapiens.Leonard', 'Hofstadter', 'Sheldon', 'roommate', 'primary', 'keeper', 'experimental', 'physicist', 'Sheldon', 'idiosyncrasies', 'personal', 'neurosis', 'not', 'mention', 'crush', 'neighbor', 'Penny', 'Which', 'crush', 'lunar', 'eclipses', 'follow', 'predicted', 'yet', 'unavoidable', 'periodicity.Howard', 'Wolowitz', 'only', 'one', 'PhD', 'yet', 'Sheldon', 'never', 'forget', 'electrical', 'engineer', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'mechanized', 'arm', 'used', 'space', 'shuttle', 'now', 'working', 'liquid', 'waste', 'management', 'solutions', 'also', 'managed', 'wreck', 'Mars', 'rover', 'hopes', 'landing', 'girl', 'made', 'sure', 'one', 'can', 'prove', 'anything.The', 'fact', 'short', 'man', 'severely', 'outdated', 'misguided', 'sense', 'fashion', 'still', 'mother', 'using', 'collection', 'pickup', 'lines', 'straight', 'men', 'magazines', 'advice', 'columns', 'yet', 'God', 'gift', 'women', 'just', 'hilarious.Now', 'only', 'could', 'find', 'practical', 'use', 'mechanized', 'arm', 'Rajesh', 'Koothrappali', 'particle', 'astrophysicist', 'fashion', 'sense', 'close', 'absolute', 'zero', 'severe', 'case', 'shyness', 'point', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'front', 'women', 'inebriated', 'using', 'poor', 'Indian', 'defense', 'father', 'rich', 'doctor', 'who', 'Bentley.Finally', 'Penny', 'proverbial', 'good', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'came', 'California', 'stardom', 'aspirations', 'so', 'far', 'waitress', 'sequence', 'bad', 'boyfriends', 'Sheldon', 'fact', 'calculated', 'exact', 'number', 'extrapolated', 'bell-curve', 'started', '14', 'obviously', 'neighbors.The', 'show', 'unavoidably', 'use', 'previous', 'sitcom', 'combinations', 'odd', 'couple', 'unfulfilled', 'love-interest', 'mismatch', 'even', 'one', 'discern', 'are', 'used', 'such', 'fresh', 'manner', 'left', 'great', 'entertainment', 'way', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'own', 'DVD', 'writing', 'so', 'smart', 'jokes', 'fly', 'so', 'fast', 'many', 'non-verbal', 'just', 'way', 'savor', 'weekly', 'air', 'time', 'Well', 'may', 'be', 'Sheldon', 'could', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'can', 'compare', 'intellect', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A
