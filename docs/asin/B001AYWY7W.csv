1169081,AUJEF31CXWTCQ,B001AYWY7W,Amazon Customer,"[16, 18]","The Vanguard is the story of civilization in the near future; a world where governments have collapsed, and ""Biosyn"" zombies roam the world, outnumbering surviving humans.The movie focuses on Max (played by Ray Bullock Jr.), a deaf survivor who is holed up in the middle of the woods. We are treated to the manner and lengths Max must go to survive. Ray soon stumbles into a corporation soldier and two resistance fighters. It is here that the story takes off.For a lower budget flick, The Vanguard features a very immersive and fresh story. The acting is very good, and Ray Bullock Jr. is a real pleasure to watch. He carries the film well for the first thirty minutes, creating a very believable character and a very believable predicament. Emma Choy also adds a sturdy performance as Rachael.The action is fierce and enjoyable, with flashes of gore. But, with that said, the gore is not overdone to the extreme. You will find plenty of blood, and plenty of satisfying battles with the zombies, but nothing that causes you to turn your head away from the film.Despite all The Vanguard's good points, it does have several minor flaws, preventing it from being as good as it could have been. The story lulls a bit at times, but not so much that you want to give up on the film. The story also can be unclear at times, but I didn't find this to be too annoying. After all, the film is set in the future; a future where many things have changed and there is much we must be informed about.Fans of horror, action and zombie flicks should definitely check out this movie. It is a film with some very memorable scenes, and a movie that just might be better the second time around.",4,Much Better Than I Expected,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,1675,"['Vanguard', 'story', 'civilization', 'near', 'future', 'world', 'where', 'governments', 'have', 'collapsed', 'Biosyn', 'zombies', 'roam', 'world', 'outnumbering', 'surviving', 'humans.The', 'movie', 'Max', 'played', 'Ray', 'Bullock', 'Jr.', 'deaf', 'survivor', 'who', 'holed', 'up', 'middle', 'woods', 'are', 'treated', 'manner', 'lengths', 'Max', 'must', 'go', 'survive', 'Ray', 'soon', 'corporation', 'soldier', 'two', 'resistance', 'fighters', 'here', 'story', 'off.For', 'lower', 'budget', 'flick', 'Vanguard', 'very', 'immersive', 'fresh', 'story', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Ray', 'Bullock', 'Jr.', 'real', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'film', 'well', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'creating', 'very', 'believable', 'character', 'very', 'believable', 'predicament', 'Emma', 'Choy', 'also', 'sturdy', 'performance', 'Rachael.The', 'action', 'fierce', 'enjoyable', 'flashes', 'gore', 'said', 'gore', 'not', 'overdone', 'extreme', 'will', 'find', 'plenty', 'blood', 'plenty', 'satisfying', 'battles', 'zombies', 'nothing', 'turn', 'head', 'away', 'film.Despite', 'Vanguard', 'good', 'points', 'have', 'several', 'minor', 'flaws', 'preventing', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'story', 'bit', 'times', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'film', 'story', 'also', 'can', 'be', 'unclear', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'too', 'annoying', 'film', 'set', 'future', 'future', 'where', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'much', 'must', 'be', 'informed', 'about.Fans', 'horror', 'action', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'film', 'very', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'movie', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'second', 'time']","Vanguard, The"

1169086,A79P3AW4RBULS,B001AYWY7W,Jenny Sequois,"[1, 3]","The above is seen in the opening text scene of the film, explaining the situation in which the characters find themselves. One such technical error might be forgivable, but this is only one of several. Examples: the two little hatchets the protagonist uses to waste zombies always make a ringing sound when striking flesh (or when being removed from same); the film's makers can't decide if the zombies are the way they are due to a drug or an infection; we have the worst zombie slaughter sequence ever put to film; and perhaps the worst human slaughter sequence ever put to film. We also have one too many Christ figures. The worst of all though is early in the film there is a sequence where a rifle, the muzzle conveniently out of the frame, is fired. The only problem is the recoil doesn't coincide with the sound of the weapon discharging. It's off by a quarter of a second or so. The effect was very noticeable. There are additional problems with the film that are not technical in nature, but I already cannot recommend the movie so I'll dispense with a discussion of these.There are a handful of things in the movie that can be looked upon positively.  While the dialog is bad, the acting is passable for the most part. The cinematography is competent, and the score is suitably creepy from time to time.  The zombie make-up effects are slightly above average. A rather incoherent effort is made to reference man's inhumanity to man and all that (actually more of an evil elite ruining everybody else sort of angle), which made the plot at least a bit more interesting. However, these cannot save the project.I'm impressed whenever anyone manages to make a feature film.  However, this one should have been screened and shelved.  This cast and crew have potential, but need a far more disciplined approach to deliver a good film.I suppose one could make an argument that this movie should receive two stars, but more than that?

It's good to see other directors out there at least trying to make original and fresh films, and who have distinctive voices in the genre.If you like slow paced, cerebral films like Martin and the original The Vanishing then this film will appeal to you.  However there is a fairly sizeable chunk of horror fans out there who will just say the film is boring and unoriginal, mainly because their A.D.D. minds are unable to see the depth of the script below the surface level; thus they walk away thinking it's a bunch of zombies in the woods, and believe me it is so much more than that.  If you're one of these people you won't enjoy the film - my advice would be to go watch one of those pathetic '8 films to die for' after dark movies - they would be right up your street.For the rest of us, who can spot a good movie when we see one - THE VANGUARD is a great piece of Post Apocalyptic entertainment.

We may never know for sure.The acting in this film is bad. Even the actors playing zombies are really bad at it.The cinematography is boring.

This was another movie that probably seemed really awesome on paper, but then somewhere between casting the main character as a hatchet wielding Elmo-looking half-mute (I am not being facetious here!) and filming half the story in bright sepia tones, this train derailed into the farce that subsequently played out.  If you don't mind derivations of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"", which isn't in and of itself a crime, you will feel right at home for the first 30 minutes of the film.  I was even almost intrigued at first, but then the main character's internal monologues started to get more and more pompous and overblown and were never commiserate to his actual actions and demeanor.  Add to this already poorly executed Omega Man idea some half mumbled expositions that neither connect with each other or move the viewer towards some point of understanding where the story is supposed to be heading, and some amazingly improbably martial arts moves by the hatchet wielding main character after he puts a chop on someone, and you  will start to feel as surly as some of those biosyms we are supposed to boo and hiss at throughout the movie.

This reminded me of mad max with zombies. It's funny but the main character is named Max as well. Maybe it isn't a coincedence. This movie takes place in the future and oil once again is the cause for the distruction of the world. A virus is let loose and all hell breaks loose. The movie doesn't have a lot of dialoge and there is not a lot of action. Then what makes this a great film? Well this is a film that requires some thinking. I'm sorry I probably lost some of you who love endless, pointless violence. The movie expects you to chose who is worse the zombies or the humans? The humans are just as savage and seem to kill more than the zombies do. The movie expects you to see mankind completely lost and becoming more like the zombies and less human. Even Max is having trouble figuring out who is more evil man or the zombie. This is a great film it makes you actually think of man as the monster instead of the zombie. If you love zombie movies this one is unique and would not be a waste of time. If you expect tons of violence then don't waste your time on this film. The violence is there and it is pretty gory at times, but it isn't pointless violence like most zombie movies.There seem to be a lot of people who don't understand zombie movies.

1169092,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001AYWY7W,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""The Vanguard"" is a UK film that opens with a lengthy exposition scrolling up the screen, explaining the set-up. The time is set in 2015 when ""the world is in chaos"" and ""the last known oil fields have been lost to a global war."" One big corporation creates a drug that has turned most of the human beings into 'Biosyns' or zombies if you like. You have to read this part carefully; otherwise, you will spend the following 89 minutes at a loss as to what is going on.Even if you read and understand it, things would not be better. The film centers on a character called Max (Ray Bullock Jr.) living alone in the woods and battling the zombies that run and attack like apes. Max deftly uses a pair of axes, his choice of weapons, and when he moves, he rides a bicycle. Also, he seems to be waiting for someone for a long time.Certainly the character and the story are not very original, the same kind of theme explored recently in ""I Am Legend,"" but still the film's premise has potential. However, the slow narrative drags, not knowing where it is going. The post-apocalyptic world of the film doesn't look like one. I know this is a low-budget movie, but still you have to show how the world has changed, instead of just telling about it.The most disappointing part is actions, which is not exciting enough. Lots of gores are used, and the idea of ax-wielding and spear-throwing hero is not bad, but the combat scenes (especially those in the earlier part of the story) need better choreography and editing. For all the nice ideas, ""The Vanguard"" falls short of its potential.",1,"Familiar Story, Dull Storytelling",1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,1577,"['Vanguard', 'UK', 'film', 'lengthy', 'exposition', 'scrolling', 'up', 'screen', 'explaining', 'set-up', 'time', 'set', '2015', 'when', 'world', 'chaos', 'last', 'known', 'oil', 'fields', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'global', 'war', 'One', 'big', 'corporation', 'drug', 'turned', 'most', 'human', 'beings', ""'Biosyns"", 'zombies', 'like', 'have', 'read', 'part', 'carefully', 'otherwise', 'will', 'spend', 'following', '89', 'minutes', 'loss', 'what', 'going', 'on.Even', 'read', 'understand', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'centers', 'character', 'called', 'Max', 'Ray', 'Bullock', 'Jr.', 'living', 'alone', 'woods', 'battling', 'zombies', 'run', 'attack', 'apes', 'Max', 'deftly', 'pair', 'axes', 'choice', 'weapons', 'when', 'bicycle', 'Also', 'be', 'waiting', 'someone', 'long', 'time.Certainly', 'character', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'same', 'kind', 'theme', 'explored', 'recently', 'Am', 'Legend', 'still', 'film', 'premise', 'potential', 'However', 'slow', 'narrative', 'drags', 'not', 'knowing', 'where', 'going', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'film', ""n't"", 'look', 'one', 'know', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'still', 'have', 'show', 'how', 'world', 'changed', 'instead', 'just', 'telling', 'it.The', 'most', 'disappointing', 'part', 'actions', 'not', 'exciting', 'enough', 'Lots', 'gores', 'are', 'used', 'idea', 'ax-wielding', 'spear-throwing', 'hero', 'not', 'bad', 'combat', 'scenes', 'especially', 'earlier', 'part', 'story', 'need', 'better', 'choreography', 'editing', 'nice', 'ideas', 'Vanguard', 'short', 'potential']","Vanguard, The"

I just couldn't believe what they stated in this movie so openly.Anyways, GREAT MOVIE!And next time your in a gun fight, forget the knife and bring a hatchet! haha! Max, the ""anti-hero"" is totally awesome. A ninja in the woods.And the fact that 3/4ths of the population was culled and in so doing created these zombie/monsters is almost prophetic.That's right folks! 3\4th of the world population was ""culled"" to keep the elite safe from a people's rebellion. But, the culled/zombies will be the soldiers in the rebellion and Max is their leader.Great movie.

1169094,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B001AYWY7W,Zombob,"[1, 2]","Impressive...1) ACTING: The acting was really good for a low/no budget indie. I was really impressed. Especially with the lead. If he had not been as good as he was, this movie would've failed, because his character would not have been so convincing.2) PRODUCTION: Wow! A low/no budget zombie movie with a musical score. Who'da thought? In regards to other aspects of the movie, sadly, the lack of a major budget held it back. It is very difficult to show the after effects of an apocalyptic world, when there is no money in the budget to do so. That said, the director did everything he could with his minimal budget, and must have stretched it to the limits.3) THE ZOMBIES: The zombies in The Vanguard are very animal-like. They seem to travel in packs, all hunched over like Gorillas, and when one of their own falls, they don't stop to assist, they continue on. A few times I got the impression that the packs of zombies at times just wanted to be left alone, such as some of the herds of wild animals in Africa. They'll acknowledge you, but if you leave them alone, it appears that they will leave you alone. This seemed to happen most near the end of the movie. The zombie make up, on the other hand, was pretty bottom of the barrel. From a distance, it looked okay, with the creepy eye contacts and dark veins on their faces, along with the ever present ""raccoon eyes."" But, up close, it is painfully clear that this was just black make up around the eyes and the veins seemed to be almost like tribal markings than grotesque rotted veins on their faces.4) THE CAUSE: Man-made serum to control population.5) NUDITY: None.FINAL: Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I usually am apprehensive when viewing a new entry in the low/no budget indie zombie movie section. But this one was a nice surprise. There was enough interest generated where I wanted to stay in the movie and didn't step away to check the clock or run to the frig for some snacks. I would like to see the director get some serious money and remake this with what it really needs; a budget. I think then that this would be like a smart man's zombie movie.
