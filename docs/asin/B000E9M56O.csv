Lots of early & little seen footage from the good old days with Brian, including snippets from that rare early docCharlie Is My Darling(sorry, the link to the DVD version wouldn't work), and that other, later one, title (careful, we're censored here) of which started with a ""C"", ended with an ""r"", and included the word ""Blues"".  Having read about 5 Stones biographies in past decades, I have found this to be a thoroughly engrossing 2+ hours each time I've watched it (maybe 4 times since release).  Not perfect, but what is?  I can't imagine how it could have been improved upon, save including full versions of all the songs.  But then, it would run so long it would have to be a series.  I'm all for that, of course.This is ""hi-fi stereo"", by the way; I don't think that's been mentioned.  Which enhances the musical experience.Coverage of the early Rolling Stones, with Brian Jones, occupies the first half of the 130 min video, with footage from the free concert/tribute at Hyde Park neatly placed at about dead center between beginning and end.  So, even if you're not too keen on the Stones' later efforts, you're still getting a full hour's worth of early appearances, commentaries, still shots, interviews, music, etc.  Myself, I have no problem with the post Hyde Park stuff (Altamont, ""Honky Tonk Women"", ""Brown Sugar"", and so forth), all part of the history and quite enjoyable.  I guess I do favor the early Stones; they were younger then, weren't they?  Weren't we all...This one definitely should be re-released on DVD.  I mean, this is the Rolling Stones---how can they lose?  They're bound to make money off of it... 2008 RAPWreckerds",5,"Fun Documentary, Deserves To Be Re-released",1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,1714,"['Yep', 'dated', 'documentaries', 'tend', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'Lots', 'early', 'little', 'seen', 'footage', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'Brian', 'including', 'snippets', 'rare', 'early', 'docCharlie', 'Is', 'My', 'Darling', 'sorry', 'link', 'DVD', 'version', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'other', 'later', 'one', 'title', 'careful', ""'re"", 'censored', 'here', 'started', 'C', 'ended', 'r', 'included', 'word', 'Blues', 'Having', 'read', '5', 'Stones', 'biographies', 'past', 'decades', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', '2+', 'hours', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'maybe', '4', 'times', 'release', 'Not', 'perfect', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'save', 'including', 'full', 'versions', 'songs', 'then', 'would', 'run', 'so', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'series', ""'m"", 'course.This', 'hi-fi', 'stereo', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'been', 'mentioned', 'Which', 'musical', 'experience.Coverage', 'early', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'first', 'half', '130', 'min', 'video', 'footage', 'free', 'concert/tribute', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'neatly', 'placed', 'dead', 'center', 'beginning', 'end', 'So', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'too', 'keen', 'Stones', 'later', 'efforts', ""'re"", 'still', 'getting', 'full', 'hour', 'worth', 'early', 'appearances', 'commentaries', 'still', 'shots', 'interviews', 'music', 'etc', 'have', 'problem', 'post', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'stuff', 'Altamont', 'Honky', 'Tonk', 'Women', 'Brown', 'Sugar', 'so', 'forth', 'part', 'history', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'guess', 'do', 'favor', 'early', 'Stones', 'were', 'younger', 'then', 'were', ""n't"", 'Were', ""n't"", 'one', 'definitely', 'should', 'be', 're-released', 'DVD', 'mean', 'Rolling', 'Stones', '-how', 'can', 'lose', ""'re"", 'bound', 'make', 'money', '2008', 'RAPWreckerds']",N/A

For the longest time it was only available on VHS and even then it was hard to find. A great documentary put together about the time of Steel Wheels to commemorate 25 years as a band and their return from a bit of a break up between Mick and Keith. Good interviews with all of the guys, a lot of good archival footage and nice production quality courtesy of Lorne Michaels.

970968,A1GVPQK9CFSU8F,B000E9M56O,Natasha Conn,"[18, 18]","This documentary was made in 1989, just as the Stones were reemerging from squabbling to become the moneyhoarding juggernaut they'll  probably still be after their grandchildren are dead. Talking head clips are interspersed with news footage, the film gaining momentum as the band mature from whiteboy blues copyists to Dark Gods of Rock. '89-era Jagger bears a terrible haircut, as do suprisingly many of his late sixties Ed Sullivan appearances, but his recollections are mildly candid and thoughtful, which for prim Mick is like the Ricky Lake show.  Keith, from meeting Muddy Waters to stealing Brian Jones' girlfriend, offers wonderful barroom frankness, Charlie is still the modern Buster Keaton of drummers (look for his 'hanging out' comment near the end), while Bill Wyman is luckily caught before his retirement two years later. Coverage of the eighties runs too long and is superfluous anyway since the band was running on fumes by then, but you'll want to watch and rewatch the section from 1968-'72,as exciting as the albums they were then making, when not even a soulless beast like Led Zeppelin could prevent them from being 'the world's greatest rock n'roll band.'",4,"Already dated, yet necessary",1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,1180,"['documentary', 'was', 'made', '1989', 'just', 'Stones', 'were', 'reemerging', 'squabbling', 'become', 'moneyhoarding', 'juggernaut', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'still', 'be', 'grandchildren', 'are', 'dead', 'Talking', 'head', 'clips', 'are', 'interspersed', 'news', 'footage', 'film', 'gaining', 'momentum', 'band', 'mature', 'whiteboy', 'blues', 'copyists', 'Dark', 'Gods', 'Rock', ""'89-era"", 'Jagger', 'terrible', 'haircut', 'do', 'suprisingly', 'many', 'late', 'sixties', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'appearances', 'recollections', 'are', 'mildly', 'candid', 'thoughtful', 'prim', 'Mick', 'Ricky', 'Lake', 'show', 'Keith', 'meeting', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'stealing', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'girlfriend', 'wonderful', 'barroom', 'frankness', 'Charlie', 'still', 'modern', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'drummers', 'look', ""'hanging"", 'out', 'comment', 'end', 'Bill', 'Wyman', 'luckily', 'caught', 'retirement', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Coverage', 'eighties', 'too', 'long', 'superfluous', 'anyway', 'band', 'was', 'running', 'fumes', 'then', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'rewatch', 'section', ""1968-'72"", 'as', 'exciting', 'albums', 'were', 'then', 'making', 'when', 'not', 'even', 'soulless', 'beast', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'could', 'prevent', 'being', ""'the"", 'world', 'greatest', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'band']",N/A

The only reason it does not get five stars is that it is dated, having been released in the late 80's, and that it is currently available only in a VHS format, which many viewers no longer use.  It is a documentary, with a lot of live-action concert shots mixed with interviews from all the band members.  There's plenty of music, much of it longer than a snippet and many times showing the majority of a song in performance.  Interesting inclusions of scenes from 'One on One' about the composition of 'Sympathy for the Devil', 'Rock and Roll Circus', and some of Jagger's films.  I would have liked a little more insight from Mick Taylor and Brian Jones.  Of course, Jones had passed away and so all the interviews had to be taken from television sources, and the few that appear are quite good and give a feel for the man.  My VHS copy has excellent sound and picture quality.  If you are a Stones fan, this would probably be an essential part of your library.  It is like a short version of the Beatles Anthology, running just a hair over two hours.Hopefully, it will be re-released in DVD format at some point.",4,Good Overview of Stones History--Where's the DVD?,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,1183,"['wonderful', 'overview', 'history', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'only', 'reason', 'not', 'get', 'five', 'stars', 'dated', 'having', 'been', 'released', 'late', '80', 'currently', 'available', 'only', 'VHS', 'format', 'many', 'viewers', 'no', 'longer', 'use', 'documentary', 'lot', 'live-action', 'concert', 'shots', 'mixed', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'plenty', 'music', 'much', 'longer', 'snippet', 'many', 'times', 'showing', 'majority', 'song', 'performance', 'Interesting', 'inclusions', 'scenes', ""'One"", 'One', 'composition', ""'Sympathy"", 'Devil', ""'Rock"", 'Roll', 'Circus', 'Jagger', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'little', 'more', 'insight', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'course', 'Jones', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'so', 'interviews', 'had', 'be', 'taken', 'television', 'sources', 'few', 'appear', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'give', 'feel', 'man', 'VHS', 'copy', 'excellent', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'Stones', 'fan', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'essential', 'part', 'library', 'short', 'version', 'Beatles', 'Anthology', 'running', 'just', 'hair', 'two', 'hours.Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 're-released', 'DVD', 'format', 'point']",N/A
