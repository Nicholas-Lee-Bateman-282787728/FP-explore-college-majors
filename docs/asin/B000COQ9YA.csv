Part of the purchase price goes to fund research on the causes of laminitis (which claimed Big Red at too young an age) and also other initiatives the Secretariat foundation sponsors to foster good  care for thoroughbreds after they have finished their racing careers.As far as the contents of the DVD, I loved seeing the original footage of Secretariat's triple crown races which I watched so many years ago.  To this day I continue to count it a very special privilege to have been around when this horse was running and later to visit him in June 1984 at Claiborne Farm. That is one of the highlighs of my life.  Everything they said  on the DVD about his good temperament, love of people and being a show off was absolutely true.Personally, this DVD brought many of those memories back to me.  I have a friend who lives in Lexington, KY and visited Secretariat regularly with a few carrots.  She misses him to this day.

I had read the reviews of this product that it was ordinary.  Because of this I refused to pay the ridiculous price of 50 bucks.  But I'm a big Secretariat fan, so when it dropped to 40 I decided to buy it for Christmas.  It was as the reviews said, ordinary at best.  I really believed they could have done a better job with the quality of film.  By far the highlight of the DVD is his 20 of 21 races.  His 2yo coverage was horrible, including no footage of the Laurel futurity.  But this isn't their fault, if the footage doesn't exist, it doesn't exist.  All the 3 year old races were good quality, they were the original video tape broadcasts, with the exception of the Preakness which was shown on film.

I am only sorry I never made the trip to Kentucky to see him but I didn't know he'd leave us so soon. Bite the bullet, pay the $50, then sit back and relive 1972 and 1973.

959599,A3B698AJ4V9NS,B000COQ9YA,Susan Nunes,"[71, 71]","I had bought the original videotape of ESPN's ""Life and Times of Secretariat,"" and the original videotape of ""Big Red's Last Race,"" about the 1973 Canadian International.  It is nice to have both documentaries on the same disc.But best of all, ALL of Secretariat's twenty-one starts are included on the disc. Almost all of them are shown in their entirety (only the very early races aren't totally complete). I am assuming all of the footage from these races came from owner Penny Chenery's private collection.It was great to watch Big Red's races from his two-year-old season in 1972. I had never seen any of those races before. From the time Red won the Hopeful, turf writers from all over the country were hailing him as the second coming of Man O'War. He of course didn't disappoint. His five losses were interesting to see, and in the cases of the 1973 Whitney and Woodward, see again. It was clear he never should have lost a race.I was extremely impressed with his first race on grass, the 1973 Man O'War. Jockey Ron Turcotte claimed Secretariat was better on the grass than he was on the dirt, and he had mentioned the horse seemed almost deer-like when he ran on the grass. In this race, Secretariat went up against the top grass horse in the United States, Tentam. Tentam did his best to try and catch Secretariat, who was on the lead most of the way in the race, but he couldn't do it.Secretariat's best performance was arguably the inaugural Marlboro Invitational. In that race, initially intended as a match race between he and stablemate Riva Ridge, there were ultimately FIVE champions in that race, including Secretariat, Riva Ridge, Kennedy Road, Key to the Mint, and Cougar II. No single race since has had that many champions. Secretariat caught Riva Ridge at the top of the stretch and coasted home in world-record time, a record which stood for many years.The DVD is expensive, but to see all of those races again it was worth the money.",5,Great CD of a Great Racehorse.,1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,1958,"['had', 'bought', 'original', 'videotape', 'ESPN', 'Life', 'Times', 'Secretariat', 'original', 'videotape', 'Big', 'Red', 'Last', 'Race', '1973', 'Canadian', 'International', 'nice', 'have', 'documentaries', 'same', 'disc.But', 'best', 'ALL', 'Secretariat', 'twenty-one', 'starts', 'are', 'included', 'disc', 'Almost', 'are', 'shown', 'entirety', 'only', 'very', 'early', 'races', 'are', ""n't"", 'totally', 'complete', 'am', 'assuming', 'footage', 'races', 'came', 'owner', 'Penny', 'Chenery', 'private', 'collection.It', 'was', 'great', 'watch', 'Big', 'Red', 'races', 'two-year-old', 'season', '1972', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'races', 'before', 'time', 'Red', 'won', 'Hopeful', 'turf', 'writers', 'country', 'were', 'hailing', 'second', 'coming', 'Man', ""O'War"", 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'five', 'losses', 'were', 'interesting', 'see', 'cases', '1973', 'Whitney', 'Woodward', 'see', 'again', 'was', 'clear', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'lost', 'race.I', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'first', 'race', 'grass', '1973', 'Man', ""O'War"", 'Jockey', 'Ron', 'Turcotte', 'claimed', 'Secretariat', 'was', 'better', 'grass', 'was', 'dirt', 'had', 'mentioned', 'horse', 'seemed', 'almost', 'deer-like', 'when', 'ran', 'grass', 'race', 'Secretariat', 'went', 'up', 'top', 'grass', 'horse', 'United', 'States', 'Tentam', 'Tentam', 'did', 'best', 'try', 'catch', 'Secretariat', 'who', 'was', 'lead', 'most', 'way', 'race', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'it.Secretariat', 'best', 'performance', 'was', 'arguably', 'inaugural', 'Marlboro', 'Invitational', 'race', 'initially', 'intended', 'match', 'race', 'stablemate', 'Riva', 'Ridge', 'were', 'ultimately', 'FIVE', 'champions', 'race', 'including', 'Secretariat', 'Riva', 'Ridge', 'Kennedy', 'Road', 'Key', 'Mint', 'Cougar', 'II', 'No', 'single', 'race', 'had', 'many', 'champions', 'Secretariat', 'caught', 'Riva', 'Ridge', 'top', 'stretch', 'coasted', 'home', 'world-record', 'time', 'record', 'stood', 'many', 'years.The', 'DVD', 'expensive', 'see', 'races', 'again', 'was', 'worth', 'money']",N/A
