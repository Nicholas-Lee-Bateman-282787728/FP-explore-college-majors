It starred Tab Hunter as probably the third movie he made as 'contract-player' for WARNER BROS, who Wellman cast after Hunter had made &#34;Track of the Cat&#34; (1955).  It was based on Wellman's own experiences as an American, who volunteered to go to FRANCE, to fight as a 'pilot' in the 'first' World War I.The biplanes used in the training sequences are really remarkable in their simple construction; followed by more sophisticated planes for the fight sequences.  They make you feel for the American boys flying those planes at that time.  Hunter's fellow cast members are interesting to see as they all emerged as successful actors in the following years.  (see if you can recognize them! in the back-grounds.)Tab Hunter wrote a biography (published 2005) that goes into the making of the movie in which he described the original ending having Hunter shot down to crash on French soil, while his French 'girl-friend' jumps off a bridge to end her life, in ending the movie.  Finishing the movie, everyone went their own way, only to be called back together again after several months to reshoot the ending.  Jack Warner wanted a &#34;Happy-Ending&#34;!  So Warner had to rent Paramount's French back-lot for Hunter and his mistress to run into each other's arms for . . .  F A D E - O U T !

William Wellman was of course in the Lafayette Escadrille and his son plays him in this movie but he isn't the lead Tab Hunter is...sadly. The tall handsome young man a few over in many scenes is the man Wellman wanted to star in the movie but the studio balked.... too bad because as anyone can tell it is Clint Eastwood.

1510506,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00652FG24,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Starring a young Paul Newman and, in his first major role, Clint Eastwood, director William Wellman returned to the theme of his Oscar-winning Wings and his own experiences as an American pilot flying for the French in World War One with 1958's epic Lafayette Escadrille, a fitting swansong for one of the great directors of the golden age - or at least that's what SHOULD have happened. Instead Jack Warner balked at the budget, insisted on casting Tab Hunter instead of the lesser-known actors (Eastwood's role went to David Janssen, leaving him in a small bit part), added a happier ending and cut the film to ribbons in post-production before changing the title to Hell Bent for Glory, with the bitterly disillusioned director never making another film. The scars are all too visible in the rushed pacing and jarring plotholes left by scenes that never made it to the final cut, the opening of the film in particular looking like someone attempted to crudely shoehorn 20 minutes of plot development from an already badly compromised script into five minutes of surviving footage that looks like it's been edited with a lawnmower.Some moments do survive, but they're few and far between. The heroes' first night in their barracks moves from a flat comic scene to a quietly mournful one where Wellman's own narration identifies of the real-life pilots sleeping alongside them by name and describes their impending deaths, and its here that you see the kind of no-nonsense tribute to the friends he left behind that he so clearly wanted to make. Wellman himself is actually a supporting character in the film, played by his own son, while Tab Hunter's hero isn't a million miles away from the kind of troubled delinquent `Wild Bill' was himself, a spoiled brat running away from a hit-and-run accident (it's tempting to see Wellman's original ending that saw him die as a kind of survivor's guilt that so many who survived the Great War when `better' men died sometimes expressed).Unfortunately the result is just a flat, Earthbound backlot melodrama with some variably staged service comedy that abandons the fledgling fliers at the halfway point as Hunter deserts to marry Etchika Choureau's hustler-turned-nice-girl. Choureau's a pretty girl and there's a nice sequence with her blowing on the sleeping Hunter's face to wake him up, but they never make a strong or convincing enough couple to make you regard their romance as anything but a distraction from what a film called Lafayette Escadrille should really be about. The film rarely gets off the ground and does little that's interesting when it does, becoming surprisingly dreary in the mid-section with Hunter hiding out in her apartment and making a furtive living trawling bars and persuading servicemen to visit one of the local brothels. Naturally his conscience gets the better of him when the film finally realises there's a war on (something there's very little sense of for most of the running time) and he rejoins the squadron, earns his wings and the film finally gets round to having some aerial footage and a dogfight in the last reel. This footage is often quite good, but it's too little too late, feeling arbitrarily slapped on. Worse, there's no real connection to or affection for the character to get you involved, something that would have been just as big a problem had the original ending where Hunter died and his sweetheart committed suicide been retained. All in all it's a sad swansong for a great director and a poor memorial to the pioneer air aces he flew alongside.Still, Warner Home Video's extras-free manufactured-on-demand PAL DVD-R at least offers a very decent black and white widescreen transfer and Leonard Rosenman's score finds a better love theme for its main characters than the film probably deserves.",2,A shadow of the film it could have been,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,3804,"['Starring', 'young', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'director', 'William', 'Wellman', 'returned', 'theme', 'Oscar-winning', 'Wings', 'own', 'experiences', 'American', 'pilot', 'flying', 'French', 'World', 'War', 'One', '1958', 'epic', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'fitting', 'swansong', 'one', 'great', 'directors', 'golden', 'age', 'least', 'what', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'happened', 'Instead', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'balked', 'budget', 'insisted', 'casting', 'Tab', 'Hunter', 'instead', 'lesser-known', 'actors', 'Eastwood', 'role', 'went', 'David', 'Janssen', 'leaving', 'small', 'bit', 'part', 'added', 'happier', 'ending', 'cut', 'film', 'ribbons', 'post-production', 'changing', 'title', 'Hell', 'Bent', 'Glory', 'bitterly', 'disillusioned', 'director', 'never', 'making', 'film', 'scars', 'are', 'too', 'visible', 'rushed', 'pacing', 'jarring', 'plotholes', 'left', 'scenes', 'never', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'opening', 'film', 'particular', 'looking', 'someone', 'attempted', 'crudely', 'shoehorn', '20', 'minutes', 'plot', 'development', 'already', 'badly', 'compromised', 'script', 'five', 'minutes', 'surviving', 'footage', 'been', 'edited', 'lawnmower.Some', 'moments', 'do', 'survive', ""'re"", 'few', 'far', 'heroes', 'first', 'night', 'barracks', 'moves', 'flat', 'comic', 'scene', 'quietly', 'mournful', 'one', 'where', 'Wellman', 'own', 'narration', 'identifies', 'real-life', 'pilots', 'sleeping', 'name', 'describes', 'impending', 'deaths', 'here', 'see', 'kind', 'no-nonsense', 'tribute', 'friends', 'left', 'behind', 'so', 'clearly', 'wanted', 'make', 'Wellman', 'actually', 'supporting', 'character', 'film', 'played', 'own', 'son', 'Tab', 'Hunter', 'hero', ""n't"", 'million', 'miles', 'away', 'kind', 'troubled', 'delinquent', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'was', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'running', 'away', 'hit-and-run', 'accident', 'tempting', 'see', 'Wellman', 'original', 'ending', 'saw', 'die', 'kind', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'survived', 'Great', 'War', 'when', 'better', 'men', 'died', 'sometimes', 'expressed', '.Unfortunately', 'result', 'just', 'flat', 'Earthbound', 'backlot', 'melodrama', 'variably', 'staged', 'service', 'comedy', 'fledgling', 'fliers', 'halfway', 'point', 'Hunter', 'marry', 'Etchika', 'Choureau', 'hustler-turned-nice-girl', 'Choureau', 'pretty', 'girl', 'nice', 'sequence', 'blowing', 'sleeping', 'Hunter', 'face', 'wake', 'up', 'never', 'make', 'strong', 'convincing', 'enough', 'couple', 'make', 'regard', 'romance', 'anything', 'distraction', 'what', 'film', 'called', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'about', 'film', 'rarely', 'ground', 'little', 'interesting', 'when', 'becoming', 'surprisingly', 'dreary', 'mid-section', 'Hunter', 'hiding', 'out', 'apartment', 'making', 'furtive', 'living', 'trawling', 'bars', 'persuading', 'servicemen', 'visit', 'one', 'local', 'brothels', 'Naturally', 'conscience', 'better', 'when', 'film', 'finally', 'war', 'something', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'squadron', 'wings', 'film', 'finally', 'round', 'having', 'aerial', 'footage', 'dogfight', 'last', 'reel', 'footage', 'often', 'quite', 'good', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'feeling', 'arbitrarily', 'slapped', 'Worse', 'real', 'connection', 'affection', 'character', 'get', 'involved', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'as', 'big', 'problem', 'had', 'original', 'ending', 'where', 'Hunter', 'died', 'sweetheart', 'committed', 'suicide', 'been', 'retained', 'sad', 'swansong', 'great', 'director', 'poor', 'memorial', 'pioneer', 'air', 'flew', 'alongside.Still', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'extras-free', 'manufactured-on-demand', 'PAL', 'DVD-R', 'least', 'offers', 'very', 'decent', 'black', 'white', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'Leonard', 'Rosenman', 'score', 'better', 'love', 'theme', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'probably']",N/A
