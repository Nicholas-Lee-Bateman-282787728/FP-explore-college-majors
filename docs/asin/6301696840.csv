Half of them were killed.  This was a group of Americans who were willing to give their lives for their ideals.  However, when they came back to the U.S., many were blacklisted as Communists and had trouble finding jobs.  It was interesting to see that American women and African Americans participated in the Lincoln brigades.  One of the African American soldiers says that he had never been treated with so much respect as when he was fighting in Spain.  Also, the people talk about how moving it was when they had to leave.  There was a celebration for them in Barcelona and Spaniards were so thankful to these people for their help.  For many, this feeling of solidarity made the whole experience worthwhile.  All of them claim that they never regretted going and that it was the best thing they had ever done in their lives.  One man says that at times he would become cynical and believe that one could never win the ""good fight"" (the title of the video) because Spain was the good fight and they lost.  Nevertheless, all of the people interviewed seem to have remained politically active throughout their lives.  At the end you see some of them marching in Washington D.C. against U.S. aid to the death squads in El Salvador in the 1980's.

262261,A3QRCK8DL8XYF5,6301696840,ASA,"[4, 6]","This is one of my all time favorite movies.  First, I have studied the Spanish Civil War for years.  My grandfather was a veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (and the Spanish Republican Army).  He spent nearly 3 years defending democracy in a country he loved.  Even 50 years after the war ended, discussions of Spain could still bring a tear to his eye.I found their choices for ""stars"" of the movie to be great.  Those interviewed have compelling stories to tell. The scenes shown from before and during the war were well chosen.  This is not a boring documentary.  It starts at the beginning in the 20's and ends in the present (1980's).This is a well made movie and should give those with no idea what the war was about a very good introduction into the tragedy.  It's a shame that the subject of the Spanish Civil War is not taught in American schools. This is a very important part of American, World, and Jewish history.  Had Hitler and Mussolini been stopped in Spain, perhaps there would not have been a World War II.BTW, a great introductory (and very interesting) book about the Spanish Civil War is ""The Passionate War"" by Peter Wyden (I think that's the spelling).

262265,A1OYW08VVPMP3Q,6301696840,"James D. Crabtree ""Doc Crabtree""","[4, 17]","This film consists of some archival footage of the Spanish Civil War and of interviews with former soldiers of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Americans who fought on behalf of the Republican government. It is not so much a history as it is an attempted vindication of leftists who supported the pro-Soviet republic.The movie attempts to simplify the events leading up to the Nationalist uprising, talking about land reform and the opening of schools. It implies that these ""progressive"" projects enraged the militarists who rebelled against the central government. It makes no mention of the atrocities that the Republican government allowed to be committed against Catholic clergy and others, nor of the growing power of seperatists and anarchists within Spain.To the credit of the producers, the film does not attempt to deny the Communist party's role in recruiting and organizing the international brigades, although it does attempt to minimize it. The film discusses how commissars ""helped to explain things."" Today these people would be called PC police.The film is a product of its times. Anti-communism was again in the air, popularized as it was by President Ronald Reagan, who not only called the Soviet Union the ""Evil Empire"" but also took concrete steps which would result in freedom for eastern Europe and the breakup of the Soviet Union. Many leftists would have found this film a refreshing bit of nostalgia for the days when being a member of a communist front organization didn't make you a communist.No doubt there were many fine people who fought on behalf of Spain for high principles but there were also those who were motivated by political considerations to fight in Spain, and if questions about communist membership was not brought up in the film it could hardly be surprising. It would be hard to be sympathetic to Party hacks who went because they were ordered to do so by the Comintern. This film doesn't mention that Moscow had directed that the various national arms of the Party join with other parties in ""popular fronts"" against the number one enemy to the USSR: fascism. Both the Communist Party of the USA and the communists in Spain organized along these lines... because of orders from Stalin.Overall the film is just sloppy. It goes on and on about the weapons embargo imposed upon Spain, one enforced by the US. One of the veterans talks about how the weapons the Republic had were old and outdated and they couldn't get any more. Well, some of the Spanish Army remained loyal and they would have been equipped in the same way. Later it talks about German and Italian assistance to the Nationalists. Then about Soviet assistence to the Republic. Then about the assistance the Nationalists received from U.S. corporations. And all this on top of the International Brigades, all of which seems to make intervention in Spain the exception rather than the rule.Historically this does have some good first-hand information about the Brigades, but I'm looking forward to seeing one that talks about how Stalin eliminated Trotkyites in the brigades.

262268,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6301696840,Randy Keehn,"[10, 14]","I developed a fascination with the Spanish Civil War as a teenager.  It may have been the idealistic enchantment of a lost cause, an appreciation of the underside of History, the concept of a prelude to WWII, or the reaction to a series of Hemingway novels.  Whatever the reason, I read what I could on the subject with a greater focus on literature than history.  There is an unusually large selection of good novels for such a relatively obscure although important conflict.  ""The Cypresses Believe in God"" is my favorite novel mainly because of its' impressive ability to weave a story that illuminates the whole of the various factions involved in the conflict. I read all I could of Cela, Hemingway, and Orwell as well as ""One Million Dead"" and ""Peace After War""; the two subsequent novels by Gironella that completed his trilogy that began with ""Cypresses"".  Throughout my 20's and 30's I would revisit the subject and I was always bothered by the inability to change the outcome of the Civil War.  However, as I read more and more, especially ""Homage to Catalonia"", I was gradually realizing the negative side of the Loyalists.  Their dominance by Stalinists could have turned Spain into another Albania; a Stalinist country that outlasted Stalin and had a dictator who ruled almost as long as Franco.  I never reached the point where I started cheering for the Nationalists but I certainly had lost the idealism of my Youth.I caught a sense of that idealism last night when I watched ""The Good Fight"".  As my informed mind tried to keep my emotions in check, I found myself absorbed by the members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and the thoughts and recollections that they shared on film.  There was a lot of newsreels of the events in Spain and film of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  There was a lot of personal recollections as well as personal observations.  The veterans that were interviewed were very dedicated people and I couldn't help but appreciate what their motivations were.  I knew that there was a fair amount of socialist propaganda as the producers of the film chose to focus the beginning of the story on the Depression, joblessness and labor union strife in the US.  However, in all fairness, this is what seems to have formed the motivation of the selected interviewees.  Some were communists but others were seemingly less inclined and their lives after the Spanish Civil War reflected life-long dedication to fighting oppression wherever they found it.  They acknowledged a number of shortcomings on their side but they also made the point that, I believe, led me in their direction as a young man; the Spanish Civil War was the opportunity to stop the rise of Fascism in Europe.  Europe and America's refusal to aid the Loyalists may have led to WWII which caused the deaths of tens of millions of people.  In my ""reformed"" perspective, I realized that the true saga of the Twentieth Century was the necessity to defeat both Fascism AND Communism.  Still, I practically got goosebumps in appreciation for what this film had to share.  I rented the copy I watched last night.  I know that I will eventually own a copy of my own.  This is an excellent documentary (even though I had to debrief myself afterwards).",5,Homage to Commitment,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,3242,"['developed', 'fascination', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'teenager', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'idealistic', 'enchantment', 'lost', 'cause', 'appreciation', 'underside', 'History', 'concept', 'prelude', 'WWII', 'reaction', 'series', 'Hemingway', 'novels', 'reason', 'read', 'what', 'could', 'subject', 'greater', 'focus', 'literature', 'history', 'unusually', 'large', 'selection', 'good', 'novels', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'important', 'conflict', 'Cypresses', 'Believe', 'God', 'favorite', 'novel', 'mainly', 'impressive', 'ability', 'weave', 'story', 'whole', 'various', 'factions', 'involved', 'conflict', 'read', 'could', 'Cela', 'Hemingway', 'Orwell', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'Million', 'Dead', 'Peace', 'War', 'two', 'subsequent', 'novels', 'Gironella', 'completed', 'trilogy', 'began', 'Cypresses', '20', '30', 'would', 'revisit', 'subject', 'was', 'always', 'bothered', 'inability', 'change', 'outcome', 'Civil', 'War', 'However', 'read', 'more', 'more', 'especially', 'Homage', 'Catalonia', 'was', 'gradually', 'realizing', 'negative', 'side', 'Loyalists', 'dominance', 'Stalinists', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'Spain', 'Albania', 'Stalinist', 'country', 'outlasted', 'Stalin', 'had', 'dictator', 'who', 'ruled', 'almost', 'as', 'long', 'Franco', 'never', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'started', 'cheering', 'Nationalists', 'certainly', 'had', 'lost', 'idealism', 'Youth.I', 'caught', 'sense', 'idealism', 'last', 'night', 'when', 'watched', 'Good', 'Fight', 'informed', 'mind', 'tried', 'keep', 'emotions', 'check', 'found', 'absorbed', 'members', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Brigade', 'thoughts', 'recollections', 'shared', 'film', 'was', 'lot', 'newsreels', 'events', 'Spain', 'film', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Brigade', 'was', 'lot', 'personal', 'recollections', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'observations', 'veterans', 'were', 'interviewed', 'were', 'very', 'dedicated', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'appreciate', 'what', 'motivations', 'were', 'knew', 'was', 'fair', 'amount', 'socialist', 'propaganda', 'producers', 'film', 'chose', 'focus', 'beginning', 'story', 'Depression', 'joblessness', 'labor', 'union', 'strife', 'US', 'However', 'fairness', 'have', 'formed', 'motivation', 'selected', 'interviewees', 'were', 'communists', 'others', 'were', 'seemingly', 'less', 'inclined', 'lives', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'reflected', 'life-long', 'dedication', 'fighting', 'oppression', 'found', 'acknowledged', 'number', 'shortcomings', 'side', 'also', 'made', 'point', 'believe', 'led', 'direction', 'young', 'man', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'opportunity', 'stop', 'rise', 'Fascism', 'Europe', 'Europe', 'America', 'refusal', 'aid', 'Loyalists', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'WWII', 'caused', 'deaths', 'tens', 'millions', 'people', 'reformed', 'perspective', 'realized', 'true', 'saga', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'was', 'necessity', 'defeat', 'Fascism', 'Communism', 'Still', 'practically', 'got', 'goosebumps', 'appreciation', 'what', 'film', 'had', 'share', 'rented', 'copy', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'know', 'will', 'eventually', 'own', 'copy', 'own', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'even', 'had', 'debrief', 'afterwards']",N/A
