After the first 2 episodes I was skeptical, but once I started fast forwarding through the music at the beginning & end I found I was drawn into the story. Yes, the music is dreadful. Thankfully there is little to no music during the episodes. Yes, the video quality it not up to 2012 standards...more like 1979 ! BUT, I felt that the acting & story line were fine. There is something strangely compelling about the whole series. It did take me awhile to warm up to it, & I did dislike some of the characters so much that I was almost put off. But the story lines of almost all the characters is resolved in a tidy, pretty satisfactory, if predictable way. I am a sucker for happy endings. So spoiler alert for those for whom it is a ""must have"".If you are Hugely disappointed in the fact that Christina's first love is ""thwarted"", then stick with the series till the end. For optimal happiness for those who find Christina's second experience with love to be Vital....you might want to stop watching the series at episode 9, right after a couple drive away in a car with a sign attached to the back of it and mark & Dorothy discuss the signage on the back of the car.Through out this series I liked that The characters go through hard times,but decide how they will let it effect them. I really like that good prevails. I like that they portray that doing what is right & setting your mind to do good, does have a cost, just as it's satisfying to see that evil doesn't always get it's way.There are so few movies & TV series that extol ""virtues"" and are morally satisfying. Give me characters of quality that take a stand for what they believe and who hold that line even when it's extremely hard..so that's why I like this series",4,Take a chance on it if you enjoyed Cranford & Lark Rise,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,1882,"['Having', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'production', 'film', 'story', 'moral', 'qualities', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'Cranford', 'series', 'happened', 'series', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'was', 'skeptical', 'once', 'started', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'music', 'beginning', 'end', 'found', 'was', 'drawn', 'story', 'Yes', 'music', 'dreadful', 'Thankfully', 'little', 'music', 'episodes', 'Yes', 'video', 'quality', 'not', '2012', 'standards', 'more', '1979', 'BUT', 'felt', 'acting', 'story', 'line', 'were', 'fine', 'something', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'whole', 'series', 'did', 'take', 'warm', 'up', 'did', 'dislike', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'almost', 'put', 'off', 'story', 'lines', 'almost', 'characters', 'resolved', 'tidy', 'pretty', 'satisfactory', 'predictable', 'way', 'am', 'sucker', 'happy', 'endings', 'So', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'whom', 'must', 'have', 'are', 'Hugely', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'Christina', 'first', 'love', 'thwarted', 'then', 'stick', 'series', 'end', 'optimal', 'happiness', 'who', 'find', 'Christina', 'second', 'experience', 'love', 'be', 'Vital', '.you', 'might', 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'series', 'episode', '9', 'right', 'couple', 'drive', 'away', 'car', 'sign', 'attached', 'back', 'mark', 'Dorothy', 'signage', 'back', 'car.Through', 'series', 'liked', 'characters', 'go', 'through', 'hard', 'times', 'decide', 'how', 'will', 'let', 'effect', 'really', 'good', 'prevails', 'like', 'portray', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'setting', 'mind', 'do', 'good', 'have', 'cost', 'just', 'satisfying', 'see', 'evil', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'virtues', 'are', 'morally', 'satisfying', 'Give', 'characters', 'quality', 'take', 'stand', 'what', 'believe', 'who', 'hold', 'line', 'even', 'when', 'extremely', 'hard..so', 'why', 'like', 'series']",N/A
1411541,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B004JMSIVI,Byron Kolln,"[7, 7]","Few period dramas exhibit the same strong spell of haunting beauty which swirls around every facet of FLAMBARDS.  Based on K.M. Peyton's original trilogy of books, the story, which begins in the Edwardian period, illustrates the shifting values, historical events and technological advances of the era and their ramifications on the Russell family.Pushed from pillar to post since the death of her parents, 16-year-old Christina Parsons (Christine McKenna) goes to live with her embittered, wheelchair-bound Uncle Russell (Edward Judd) and his two sons at Flambards, a sprawling country estate.  Due to come into a considerable inheritance when she turns 21, Uncle Russell hopes to eventually marry Christina off to his elder son Mark (Steven Grives) - a wastrel and womaniser - and restore crumbling Flambards to its former glory.  But to his frustration, Uncle Russell notices a blossoming flirtation with younger son William (Alan Parnaby), a gentle soul who isn't much interested in the traditional family pursuits of horses and hunting - he has plans on building and piloting new-fangled ""flying machines"".Eventually the differences between William and his father cause a huge family rift, resulting in Christina and William fleeing Flambards for a new start in Battersea.  There, William joins a group of young flyers at Elm Park whilst Christina goes to work at the nearby Chase Private Hotel.  With a bright new circle of friends including daredevil pilot Sandy (Peter Settelen) and his vivacious girlfriend Dorothy (Carol Leader), the future looks rosy... until the clouds of WW1 start to gather overhead...A tightly-packed thirteen-part miniseries, FLAMBARDS initially unfolds at a leisurely pace and you may find yourself struggling throughout the first 2 episodes especially (""Christina"" and ""The Blooding"") but the action soon picks up and you'll want to savour each subsequent episode.  The performances are first-rate, particularly lovely Christine McKenna who virtually carries the entire story on her slender shoulders (and looks like she has literally stepped from the pages of the books).  Alan Parnaby and Steven Grives contrast well but are also believable as brothers.  Fondly-remembered former ""Play School"" presenter Carol Leader is a delight as Dorothy.The music, as other reviewers have mentioned, takes some getting used-to but is probably FLAMBARDS' most fascinating element.  Highlighted by the jaunty ""Song of Christina"" (featured most prominently in the episode ""The Edge of the Cloud"" where William and Christina fly over the English Channel), the musical score by David Fanshawe is minimalist and beautifully underscores the various characters; but having said that, it's probably the only element which dates the entire series.  Still, recommended.",4,"""I'll sing you a song of Christina at Flambards...""",1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,2782,"['Few', 'period', 'dramas', 'exhibit', 'same', 'strong', 'spell', 'haunting', 'beauty', 'swirls', 'facet', 'FLAMBARDS', 'Based', 'K.M', 'Peyton', 'original', 'trilogy', 'books', 'story', 'Edwardian', 'period', 'shifting', 'values', 'historical', 'events', 'technological', 'advances', 'era', 'ramifications', 'Russell', 'family.Pushed', 'pillar', 'post', 'death', 'parents', '16-year-old', 'Christina', 'Parsons', 'Christine', 'McKenna', 'live', 'embittered', 'wheelchair-bound', 'Uncle', 'Russell', 'Edward', 'Judd', 'two', 'sons', 'Flambards', 'sprawling', 'country', 'estate', 'Due', 'come', 'considerable', 'inheritance', 'when', '21', 'Uncle', 'Russell', 'eventually', 'marry', 'Christina', 'elder', 'son', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Grives', 'wastrel', 'womaniser', 'restore', 'crumbling', 'Flambards', 'former', 'glory', 'frustration', 'Uncle', 'Russell', 'blossoming', 'flirtation', 'younger', 'son', 'William', 'Alan', 'Parnaby', 'gentle', 'soul', 'who', ""n't"", 'much', 'interested', 'traditional', 'family', 'pursuits', 'horses', 'hunting', 'plans', 'building', 'piloting', 'new-fangled', 'flying', 'machines', '.Eventually', 'differences', 'William', 'father', 'cause', 'huge', 'family', 'rift', 'resulting', 'Christina', 'William', 'fleeing', 'Flambards', 'new', 'start', 'Battersea', 'William', 'group', 'young', 'flyers', 'Elm', 'Park', 'whilst', 'Christina', 'work', 'nearby', 'Chase', 'Private', 'Hotel', 'bright', 'new', 'circle', 'friends', 'including', 'daredevil', 'pilot', 'Sandy', 'Peter', 'Settelen', 'vivacious', 'girlfriend', 'Dorothy', 'Carol', 'Leader', 'future', 'rosy', 'clouds', 'WW1', 'start', 'gather', 'overhead', 'tightly-packed', 'thirteen-part', 'miniseries', 'FLAMBARDS', 'initially', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'may', 'find', 'struggling', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'especially', 'Christina', 'Blooding', 'action', 'soon', 'up', ""'ll"", 'want', 'savour', 'subsequent', 'episode', 'performances', 'are', 'first-rate', 'particularly', 'lovely', 'Christine', 'McKenna', 'who', 'virtually', 'entire', 'story', 'slender', 'shoulders', 'literally', 'stepped', 'pages', 'books', 'Alan', 'Parnaby', 'Steven', 'Grives', 'contrast', 'well', 'are', 'also', 'believable', 'brothers', 'Fondly-remembered', 'former', 'Play', 'School', 'presenter', 'Carol', 'Leader', 'delight', 'Dorothy.The', 'music', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'getting', 'used-to', 'probably', 'FLAMBARDS', 'most', 'fascinating', 'element', 'Highlighted', 'jaunty', 'Song', 'Christina', 'featured', 'most', 'prominently', 'episode', 'Edge', 'Cloud', 'where', 'William', 'Christina', 'fly', 'English', 'Channel', 'musical', 'score', 'David', 'Fanshawe', 'minimalist', 'beautifully', 'various', 'characters', 'having', 'said', 'probably', 'only', 'element', 'entire', 'series', 'Still', 'recommended']",N/A

1411546,A58QBXO0HA2B4,B004JMSIVI,Fern,"[4, 4]","You'll get hooked on this movie very quickly. Thankfully, you can rent this movie from the library so you don't have to wait a week between each episode, which total about 11 hours of viewing time in all.This movie seemed like a classic to me: unforgettable, bittersweet, heartwarming. Character development is strong. The story revolves around the lives of just four people: our heroine, Christina, and the three men who fall in love with her.Christina is a free spirit who ignores the conventions of turn-of-the-century Britian to fall in love with a man from the servant class; she also winds up buying the Flambards estate after adopting the illicit son of her cousin, bad-boy Mark.Mark is the dastardly eldest brother whose passion for riding horses is only eclipsed by a remarkable cruel streak that causes him to laugh when his younger brother William falls off a horse and breaks his ankle. Marks laughs again when Violet, the servant he's been bedding, becomes pregnant and, when she confesses this to Mark's father, the Lord of the manor, is promptly fired.Violet's brother, Dick, a servant who works in the stable at Flambards, also loses his job after he brawls with Mark.Mark's younger brother, the sensitive William, is drawn to the burgeoning world of aviation, and it's as an aviator in the war that he loses his life. All the good young men enlist in the war effort, leaving only the women, elderly and unfit to serve behind.But Christina now has his child developing inside her, and she's determined to raise her child in the only home she's known, at Flambards. (When she was orphaned at a young age, Christina was sent by her aunt to live at Flambards with her cousins, Mark and William.By this time, we know that William is dead and Mark is presumed dead after he's reported missing in action. Violet, the maid impregnanted by Mark, is living in poverty with a passel of brats, and it doesn't take much cash for Christina to convince her that Tizzy, Mark's offspring, would be happier and better cared for living at Flambards.As the war rages on, Christina discovers through Violet that Dick, the strapping and handsome servant who had a falling out with Mark years earlier, is now living in London. He's struggling to survive, care for his bed-ridden mother and look out for his sister, Violet. He's forced to poach rabbits and wild game in the countryside to survive and the family lives in squalor and filth.Dick served in the war but was was discharged after taking a bullet. Christina needs him to help restore Flambards. The walls are crumbling and nearly all the good men have gone to serve in the war. She wants to grow vegetables and grains to help the farm become self-sufficient; its rolling countryside was never used for anything in the past except as a place to raise horses and as a backdrop for fox hunts.There was always this romantic spark between Chrstina and Dick, and so she is able to convince him to return to Flambards, not as a stable hand but to manage the entire farm. With Christina's encouragement, Dick begins to shed his earlier obedience to the caste system of servant/ruling class.Imagine Mark's surprise when he returns home to Flambards, straight from a prisoner of war camp, to find Christina, Dick (his nemesis), A Hun prisoner-of-war permitted to work the farm fields of Flambard and a few loyal, remaining servants living in his home.But Mark is also in love with Christina, perhaps because she sees through his callous behavior, shares his love of riding and, through the sheer goodness of her soul, makes him want to be a better man.Christina turns down his proposal of marriage not once, but twice. She simply doesn't love him. If he can't have Christina, well, he does the next best thing: he marries her best friend, a vivacious and light-hearted blond who can tame and domesticate him. Years earlier, her lover, a good buddy of William's, lost his life in a flying accident.Flambards is at its heart, about a woman and the three very different men who love her. But it's also about class, and the limitations it imposes on women, and the servant class, in 20th century England.This movie will imprint itself on your soul.

Christina the leading lady at times didn&#8217;t do a good job but I must say the stable boy Dick did a very good acting job.
