I appreciate all the many brothers tryin' to perpetrate like they the Mack too. To them I say, ""play on, if you know what it means"". Films like The Mack echo sentiments of film culture created by certain politics and demographics during certain periods in our country's comparitively short history. With the passage of time, certain words that were once insulting or taboo become cool. With the passage of time, movies ""good"" parents would not let us watch also may become cool. Regardless of what year it is, or where you come from, this movie sucks! I have seen this movie several times with friends who actually like it, and I have laughed at some of the backward lines, the tripped out clothes, and that cool scene when that guy learns to fly (I'm not giving anything away here, really). This film is like a nice trip going nowhere. Max Julien does his best with the role. He's a believeable pimp. Juanita Moore is a fine actress and plays a believeable mother to his sliminess. However, the sadest thing about this movie is the fact that the actors are really pretty good. It's the movie that sucks. You have to wonder where the good jobs were. Maybe there just weren't any. A better script, a realistic plot resolution, and deeper exploration of the characters and their motives could've made this flick less jive.

27857,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,078060959X,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[30, 33]","The Mack (1973), probably one of the most referenced movies in the hip hop culture, on appearance has all the qualities of a blaxploitation film, but a closer and thoughtful look might give you a different opinion.  Directed by documentarian Michael Campus and starring Max Julien, Richard Pryor, and Carol Speed, The Mack presents a portrait taken in time of a particular lifestyle not many ever get to see.The movie opens with two men, Goldie (Julien) and Slim (Pryor), involved in a gunfight in a junkyard.  Seemingly out numbered, Goldie tells Slim to take off (wouldn't have been my choice as Slim is sporting what appears to be a M16 while Goldie's sporting a handgun).  Slim manages to split, while Goldie gets picked up by the police, and subsequently sentenced to five years in a penitentiary.  Serving some particular hard time, Goldie gets released, and tries to put the pieces back together.  He visits his brother, Olinga, played by Roger E. Mosley (Magnum P.I.), who is involved in trying to educate and empower the community, in a character fashion after Black Panther leader Huey Long.  Basically. Goldie is presented with two options; follow his brother in focusing on making a difference through psuedo-political means, or follow the path of the Mack, becoming a flesh peddler, and gaining empowerment through the acquisition of money.  Goldie chooses the latter, hooking back up with Slim and taking advice from an older blind man, sort of a Obi Wan Kenobi of the underworld, who shares his knowledge with Goldie on how to deal with women in the Mackin' game, the importance of controlling their minds rather than just their bodies.  Goldie soon recruits some ladies of the night, and has to deal with corrupt police detectives, rival players, and various other underworld characters during his meteoric rise (he gets chosen as The Mack of the Year at an annual players ball).  As Goldie's popularity, or notoriety, increases, so does the pressures, both internal and external, along with the violence, and begins carrying over into his family, and forces Goldie to decide where it's at...The Mack certainly does seem to glorify these men who deal in the flesh trade, with their extravagant lifestyles, flashy cars, and great wads of cash, but the glamour is quickly overshadowed by the harsh realities presented as the stories progresses, and just how much one has to give up to be a success in that particular business.  There are a lot of laughs to be had here, maybe not intentional, but the film is pretty dated.  Between the dialog, stereotypes, and trash-talking criminals, there was an underlying sadness for me in the realness of the disgusting attitudes depicted towards the women, objectified to the point where they weren't even people anymore, merely tools of the trade, a means to obtaining material possessions through the sale of their bodies, and also how many look up to these men, idolizing them, thus perpetuating their activities.  Shot on location in Oakland, and featuring actual individuals within the community, the film forgoes the slickness of a Hollywood budget, but gains a real grittiness one wouldn't be able to reproduce on a soundstage.  The dialog, a lot of it improvised, and some indistinguishable, only adds to the realistic quality of the film, but also isolates it, in my opinion, within the time period in which it was made.  The funniest part had to be when Goldie had his women at a planetarium, using the effects of the simulated stars and a microphone to subliminally enforce his will through their repetition of his player mantras.  I did like how the film ended, nicely book ending the beginning, bringing the main character full circle.Presented here is a very good looking wide screen version of the film, which runs approximately 110 minutes.  Special features include an original theatrical trailer, a commentary track featuring star Max Julien, producer Harvey Bernard, director Michael Campus, and actors Richard Anthony Williams, Annazette Chase, Don Gordon, and George Murdok, along with an excellent 38 minute featurette titled Mackin' Ain't Easy, which looks back on the making of the film, detailing all the problems and issues that arose, especially those filming on location within Oakland in the early 70's.  To some extent, I found this almost more enjoyable than the movie.Cookieman108",3,&quot;a wad of cash so big your pockets look like they got mumps&quot;,1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,4366,"['Mack', '1973', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'referenced', 'movies', 'hip', 'hop', 'culture', 'appearance', 'qualities', 'blaxploitation', 'film', 'closer', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'might', 'give', 'different', 'opinion', 'Directed', 'documentarian', 'Michael', 'Campus', 'starring', 'Max', 'Julien', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Carol', 'Speed', 'Mack', 'portrait', 'taken', 'time', 'particular', 'lifestyle', 'not', 'many', 'ever', 'get', 'see.The', 'movie', 'two', 'men', 'Goldie', 'Julien', 'Slim', 'Pryor', 'involved', 'gunfight', 'junkyard', 'Seemingly', 'numbered', 'Goldie', 'Slim', 'take', 'off', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'choice', 'Slim', 'sporting', 'what', 'be', 'M16', 'Goldie', 'sporting', 'handgun', 'Slim', 'split', 'Goldie', 'picked', 'up', 'police', 'subsequently', 'sentenced', 'five', 'years', 'penitentiary', 'Serving', 'particular', 'hard', 'time', 'Goldie', 'released', 'tries', 'put', 'pieces', 'back', 'together', 'brother', 'Olinga', 'played', 'Roger', 'E.', 'Mosley', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'who', 'involved', 'trying', 'educate', 'empower', 'community', 'character', 'fashion', 'Black', 'Panther', 'leader', 'Huey', 'Long', 'Basically', 'Goldie', 'presented', 'two', 'options', 'follow', 'brother', 'focusing', 'making', 'difference', 'psuedo-political', 'means', 'follow', 'path', 'Mack', 'becoming', 'flesh', 'peddler', 'gaining', 'empowerment', 'acquisition', 'money', 'Goldie', 'latter', 'hooking', 'back', 'up', 'Slim', 'taking', 'advice', 'older', 'blind', 'man', 'sort', 'Obi', 'Wan', 'Kenobi', 'underworld', 'who', 'shares', 'knowledge', 'Goldie', 'how', 'deal', 'women', 'Mackin', 'game', 'importance', 'controlling', 'minds', 'rather', 'just', 'bodies', 'Goldie', 'soon', 'ladies', 'night', 'deal', 'corrupt', 'police', 'detectives', 'rival', 'players', 'various', 'other', 'underworld', 'characters', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'chosen', 'Mack', 'Year', 'annual', 'players', 'ball', 'Goldie', 'popularity', 'notoriety', 'increases', 'so', 'pressures', 'internal', 'external', 'violence', 'carrying', 'over', 'family', 'forces', 'Goldie', 'decide', 'where', 'Mack', 'certainly', 'seem', 'glorify', 'men', 'who', 'deal', 'flesh', 'trade', 'extravagant', 'lifestyles', 'flashy', 'cars', 'great', 'wads', 'cash', 'glamour', 'quickly', 'overshadowed', 'harsh', 'realities', 'presented', 'stories', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'give', 'up', 'be', 'success', 'particular', 'business', 'are', 'lot', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'maybe', 'not', 'intentional', 'film', 'pretty', 'dated', 'dialog', 'stereotypes', 'trash-talking', 'criminals', 'was', 'underlying', 'sadness', 'realness', 'disgusting', 'attitudes', 'depicted', 'women', 'objectified', 'point', 'where', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'people', 'anymore', 'merely', 'tools', 'trade', 'means', 'obtaining', 'material', 'possessions', 'sale', 'bodies', 'also', 'how', 'many', 'look', 'up', 'men', 'idolizing', 'thus', 'perpetuating', 'activities', 'Shot', 'location', 'Oakland', 'featuring', 'actual', 'individuals', 'community', 'film', 'slickness', 'Hollywood', 'budget', 'gains', 'real', 'grittiness', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'reproduce', 'soundstage', 'dialog', 'lot', 'improvised', 'indistinguishable', 'only', 'realistic', 'quality', 'film', 'also', 'opinion', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'made', 'funniest', 'part', 'had', 'be', 'when', 'Goldie', 'had', 'women', 'planetarium', 'using', 'effects', 'simulated', 'stars', 'microphone', 'subliminally', 'enforce', 'will', 'repetition', 'player', 'mantras', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'film', 'ended', 'nicely', 'book', 'ending', 'beginning', 'bringing', 'main', 'character', 'full', 'circle.Presented', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'wide', 'screen', 'version', 'film', 'approximately', '110', 'minutes', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'star', 'Max', 'Julien', 'producer', 'Harvey', 'Bernard', 'director', 'Michael', 'Campus', 'actors', 'Richard', 'Anthony', 'Williams', 'Annazette', 'Chase', 'Don', 'Gordon', 'George', 'Murdok', 'excellent', '38', 'minute', 'featurette', 'titled', 'Mackin', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Easy', 'back', 'making', 'film', 'detailing', 'problems', 'issues', 'arose', 'especially', 'filming', 'location', 'Oakland', 'early', '70', 'extent', 'found', 'almost', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'movie.Cookieman108']",N/A

And then there's the story of some of Richard Pryor's bizarre behaviour.As many times as I've seen the film, many of the scenes get better and better, and with the added commentary I can now see them in a separate way.Max Julien is a great storyteller - - The Mack is - - well, THE MOVIE ! ! !",5,Get the DVD ! ! !,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,1245,"['First', 'all', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Mack', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'million', 'copies', 'videos', 'taped', 'off', 'cable', 'whatever', ""'re"", 'too', 'young', 'something', 'matter', 'just', 'one', 'THOSE', 'films', 'epitome', 'everything', 'cool', 'funky', ""'70s"", 'Hey', 'film', 'Mackin', 'right', 'what', 'version', 'having', 'commentary', 'Julien', 'Director', 'other', 'people', 'involved', 'apparenty', 'story', 'story', 'almost', 'as', 'interesting', 'film', 'hard', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'amazing', 'hear', 'true', 'story', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Mack', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'West', 'Coast', 'who', 'acted', 'film', 'AND', 'provided', 'security', 'was', 'shot', 'back', 'head', 'filming', 'finger', 'pointed', 'according', 'SOME', 'people', 'Huey', 'Newtown', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'who', 'certain', 'cast', 'members', 'allege', 'acted', 'more', 'gangsters', 'gangsters', 'then', 'story', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'bizarre', 'behaviour.As', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'many', 'scenes', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'added', 'commentary', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'separate', 'way.Max', 'Julien', 'great', 'storyteller', 'Mack', 'well', 'THE', 'MOVIE']",N/A

The movie simply shows the life of a ghetto child with his back against the wall. The same  reality for the main character,Goldie, is the same today for a inner city youth. Goldie,like any other ghetto child, wants the finer things in life that are just not acessiable through by honest means. You might not symphatize with Goldie but definately many would probably be able to emphatize.  The common theme is probably why such movie is a favoriet of many hip-hop artists.Goldie throughout the movie is not much of a role model so-much that he is a very tragic figure. From the opening scene to the very last of the movie you feel a certain sadness that he projects. He definately wants a better life but is too deep into the street life to escape.The Mack is definately a very dark,gritty and unsettling film to many people.  The film has edge that not many so-called blaxplotation don't really have. Much of the realism is primarily due to the guerilla film making by Michael Campus. Campus,unlike many directors of the period,went head first to get support from local criminal kingpins of Oakland.  The guidence and direction of the Ward brothers indeed shows in the final product.  Many of the scenes like the trunk of rats and dynamite scene with Pretty Tony were based on actual events.The actors and actresses in  this movie are all wonderful. Max Juilen shines as Goldie but honorable mention should go to Richard Pryor. If anybody knows about such subject matter it would definately be him.

What a great commentary on the life as a pimp, a prostitute, corruption and devotion to family.  This is a must...and I can't say enough for the 70's fashion.  You'll ""dig"" these rags.

Maybe not today but there are many stories like this from that time. This movie tells a story of truth that can really occur.This and Scarface are probably the most quoted movies of all time in music. I know I hear lines from this movie and others but a lot of lines from this movie in music I listen to. I guess you know I don't listen to country and western.Some of the highlights is the Player's Picnic, Player's Ball and maybe my favorite the planetarium. That is a classic part. Very funny. There are some cold blooded lines and scences but it all equals a classic. Due to the topic and being a black exploitation flick will never receive its just due.

I didn't watch it with them, but, throughout the years, I've heard referrences 2 it several times.  I recently bought the DVD and have since watched it twice.  I thought it was a pretty good movie.  Almost everything within the story is laid out:  why he was in Cali, why he went to prison, his reason for becoming a pimp, and why he ended up the way he did at the end of the movie.  In other words, it explains in detail the cause and effects of his pimpin'.  Not only that, but, the soundtrack is  pretty cool.  The acting could have been better, but, the film made up in other parts for what it lacked in the acting.  The DVD transfer could have been better, but, you have to realize that maybe the source (the film) may have had more grain on it than one can deal with being that this film is almost 30 years old.  The sound quality updates the film for the new millenium (pay 'taintion to the surround sound).
