641462,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B00005JOJR,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[0, 0]","I bought the SCARECROW AND MRS. KING: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON because it was on sale here on Amazon.I remember watching the series when I was a kid, although I couldn't remember a single episode, and Kate Jackson was my favorite angel onCharlie's Angels - The Complete First Season. I always thought she was funny on ""Charlie's Angels"" and so I decided to give ""Scarecrow"" a try.This show is great! It brought back a lot of memories especially after I heard the opening theme song.Kate Jackson is wonderful as ""Amanda King,"" the suburban divorced mother of two, whose mother is living with her when she gets ""drafted"" into becoming a government operative. Jackson has great comedic timing and even though she plays a bumbling housewife, she comes up with some out-of-the-box thinking to help ""Scarecrow"" crack the case. Bruce Boxleitner is dashing as the suave ""007"" type of government agent, Lee ""Scarecrow"" Stetson, who ropes Amanda into working for the US Government as a ""civilian"" agent-- even though at first he can't stand working with her! Eventually they start developing a friendship and each episode borders on a little romance that might spark up between them at any moment.That romantic tension is the glue that keeps the show from becoming stale and there's mystery, crime, and action in each episode.The supporting cast includes Beverly Garland ""Dotty West"" Amanda's mother, Mel Stewart ""Billy Melrose"" the government agency boss, and Martha Smith ""Francine Desmond"" another agent, as well as two talented young boys, Greg Morton and Paul Stout, who play Amanda's kids.Picture quality is decent and the clamshell case holds all five DVDs. It also comes with a foldout insert that lists episode name, air date, and brief description.Unfortunately there aren't any special features. I hope they release the second season soon!",5,*Fun* Show From the 80s!,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,1841,"['bought', 'SCARECROW', 'AND', 'MRS.', 'KING', 'THE', 'COMPLETE', 'FIRST', 'SEASON', 'was', 'sale', 'here', 'Amazon.I', 'remember', 'watching', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'single', 'episode', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'was', 'favorite', 'angel', 'onCharlie', 'Angels', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'so', 'decided', 'give', 'Scarecrow', 'try.This', 'show', 'great', 'brought', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'especially', 'heard', 'opening', 'theme', 'song.Kate', 'Jackson', 'wonderful', 'Amanda', 'King', 'suburban', 'divorced', 'mother', 'two', 'mother', 'living', 'when', 'drafted', 'becoming', 'government', 'operative', 'Jackson', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'even', 'bumbling', 'housewife', 'up', 'out-of-the-box', 'thinking', 'help', 'Scarecrow', 'crack', 'case', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'dashing', 'suave', '007', 'type', 'government', 'agent', 'Lee', 'Scarecrow', 'Stetson', 'who', 'Amanda', 'working', 'US', 'Government', 'civilian', 'agent', 'even', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'working', 'Eventually', 'start', 'developing', 'friendship', 'episode', 'borders', 'little', 'romance', 'might', 'spark', 'up', 'romantic', 'tension', 'glue', 'show', 'becoming', 'stale', 'mystery', 'crime', 'action', 'episode.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Beverly', 'Garland', 'Dotty', 'West', 'Amanda', 'mother', 'Mel', 'Stewart', 'Billy', 'Melrose', 'government', 'agency', 'boss', 'Martha', 'Smith', 'Francine', 'Desmond', 'agent', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'talented', 'young', 'boys', 'Greg', 'Morton', 'Paul', 'Stout', 'who', 'play', 'Amanda', 'kids.Picture', 'quality', 'decent', 'clamshell', 'case', 'five', 'DVDs', 'also', 'foldout', 'insert', 'episode', 'name', 'air', 'date', 'brief', 'description.Unfortunately', 'are', ""n't"", 'special', 'features', 'hope', 'release', 'second', 'season', 'soon']",Scarecrow and Mrs. King: Season 1

""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[4, 4]","The life of Amanda King (Kate Jackson), a divorced mother with two young sons, is turned upside down and inside out when super-sexy spy Lee (Codename: ""Scarecrow"") Stetson (Bruce Boxleitner) gives her a package and asks her to get on a train and give it to ""the  man in the red hat."" After their first ""accidental assignment"" is completed, Lee's  boss Billy Melrose (Mel Stuart) thinks that  resourseful Amanda would be a valuable asset to the ""agency."" After all, who would suspect a surburban mother, with a station wagon and a mortgage,  of being a spy? Amanda quickly becomes a ""spy in training."" Lee reluctantly takes her on as his partner; which doesn't please fellow female spy Francine (Martha Smith) at all. Trouble is, Amanda must keep her new job a secret from her sons (Paul Stout and Greg Morton) and her meddlesome but oblivious mother Dotty (Beverly Garland). Amanda comes up with some outlandish excuses for her long absences as, each episode, she and Lee go off on secret missions full of excitement, intrigue, a little danger, and a lot of comedy. While working undercover, Amanda says, ""I feel like I'm lying and cheating."" Lee replies, ""You are lying and cheating. You work for the United States government.""The superb music that plays during the opening credits of each episode perfectly illustrates the series' deft mix of action, adventure, and comedy. But it is the incredible chemistry between Bruce Boxleitner and Kate Jackson that made ""Scarecrow And Mrs. King"" a popular success for CBS from 1983-1987. Kate Jackson deservedly received Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominations for her engaging performance as Amanda. I think Bruce Boxleitner  also deserved an Emmy Award nomination  for his performance as Lee, everyone's ideal  rugged, sexy spy. Beverly Garland is a delight in her supporting role as Amanda's mother Dotty, who never notices that numerous kidnapping and asassination attempts are taking place across the street and sometimes practically in her own backyard.All 21 episodes from Season 1 (1983) are included in an attractive, easy to use box set. The series is mostly lighthearted, escapist fun. The episode ""If Thoughts Could Kill,"" in which Lee is brainwashed to kill Billy, is about as intense and scary as the show gets. I hope that Warner Brothers will quickly release Seasons 2-4. ""Scarecrow And Mrs. King"" is more than entertaining and fun.

I was too big a fan of Remington Steele to watch anything else! After watching all the seasons of R.S. countless times, I needed to give it a break.

It's better than the constantly bickering couple in Moonlighting and it's got smarter storylines of spy, treason and espionage so typical of the Cold War era. It's funny now to hear of defection from Hungary, hearing a man being referred to as 'cute' and seeing someone rooted to the spot calling from a phone booth but it's all a good reminder of how our world has changed in 25 years. Bruce Boxleitner is certainly eye candy (even today) and Kate Jackson has good chemistry with him. I would have liked to see the Mrs. King character as a little less housewifey/ditzy though -- her character would never fly in the 00s. Beverly Garland was the quintessential nagging mother.

What makes it entertaining is watching how the game is played out between the characters not the game itself.

The chemistry between Boxleitner (Scarecrow) and Jackson's characters is instantaneous but of course, neither is willing to acknowledge it to the other. Thus, we have the setup for several years' worth of good, exciting, and relatively wholesome entertainment.

I never get tired of the very first episode.The cases are interesting enough but not too complicated. Amanda gets into just enough trouble to use her skills from being a cub scout mother and a savvy housewife to get herself out of trouble. Lee trails behind her and gets her out of the bigger messes. I think part of the appeal is that Amanda is a 'housewife' with so much potential and just when she needs to break out of the mold, Lee appears.

My mom liked it and she and I would watch every episode when it originally aired, particularly the one where Lee and Amanda finally got married. I don't have a DVR or enough time in the day to hunt and search for the episodes, which many times air out of order. Can we get this on DVD?Here is a really, super smart idea.Anyone ready for this one?Take pre-orders. Release the ENTIRE SHOW on DVD, then send it out to those who have pre-ordered it. That makes a lot of sense. Why am I seeing some new series, which haven't been on but even 1-2 seasons, before they are out on DVD.Sopranos? NIP/TUCK? These series are still being aired with new episodes weekly. I know they are popular, but come on, this show was good too.How hard can this be? There are a lot of people that like the series, and want to see it again. There was a time I had to wait 2 years in between the time it was on one station in syndication before it came back on another station.AS OF 3/9/2010....This series has been released on DVD. The earlier review was written 3 years ago. I had actually forgot I had written a review of this until I went to review it and it gave me the option to EDIT, and EDIT I shall.I still give it 5 stars. The network and production company did great by it, or as best as they could; given it's age. It has been over 20 years since it has been on and I bet the original tape/film is not as good as it once was, but it isn't as bad as it could be either.But don't look for extras--out takes, commentaries, promo commercials or even a ""behind the scenes""; because it isn't on this wonderful 5 disc set. I say wonderful because the packaging is awesome. It is one jewel case with single sided DVDs which take no more room than at best 2 DVDs on the shelf, which goes into a cardboard sleeve. It comes with a booklet to explain each episode and the characters. The DVD artwork is good. The DVDs are clearly marked and the ""menu"" screen is simple. You can play ALL episodes at once or select individual ones.As far as the quality, it might not have been digitally remastered as you can literally see the ""scratches"" in the file. The DVDs play without skipping and the episodes are just as wonderful as I remember them being.If you love the series, here it is.

It's actually an interesting experience to see what I loved as a kid and realize the quality was really there. There are very small details in dialog in Season 1 that get unexpectedly added by the characters - perhaps even are ad-libbed by the actors themselves. Very quick rejoinders that you don't expect enhance the dimension of the characters and the humor. The pacing of the romantic tension between the lead characters is excellent in season 1, given the fact that you'd never know whether or not you were going to be renewed when you start shooting. (Nowadays, you don't even know you're renewed after finishing the season...) SC&MRS.K still holds up very well.

I was instantly hooked on it when the pilot first aired and I purchased Season 1 as fast as I could when it was released. I have now re-watched the entire season.This show was VERY entertaining, VERY exciting and VERY romantic.  This is among the very few shows that kept a would-be relationship hanging for a long time without upsetting, frustrating or boring me.Bruce Boxleitner is his usual suave self as the Scarecrow.  He makes a great spy and a very magnetic love-interest.  It's really very heart-warming when we, the audience, see how he is falling for Amanda King.Mrs. King (two boys, divorced), who desperately needs a flexible part-time job in the pilot, is also charming, but in her very disarming and gentle way.  She is fun, funny, smart and humble, and wins the heart of nearly everyone she meets.  (This excludes, of course, the few people who have their ego, ambition or plans dented by Mrs. King's presence.)  Kate Jackson has never been better, and she's always good!The chemistry, as others have mentioned, is amazing.If you haven't seen SCARECROW AND MRS. KING, please seek it out.

Someone made the comment about all the stupid shows being released on DVD and why not this one, but that's just the point.  The ones that weren't popular are going to be a lot cheaper to buy the rights and reproduce.  Here's a series that was great from beginning to end: with humor, action, and a even a good romance thrown in; and we're probably waiting for nothing as the studio will never bother re-releasing it.  So, all the die-hard fans will end up buying unauthorized copies and the studio will continue its efforts to stem illegal pirating, which is ironic when most people would prefer to pay for a well-made copy in the first place.

Of course the US government won't give up their prize rook captured for a small pawn, but Scarecrow (the real one) takes matters in his own hands to get her back. This puts him in trouble with the agency, so he must break up the Russian ring to clear his name.

641577,AAHGPDGEDRVEN,B00005JOJR,"Tracy Christenson ""dictionary enchantress""","[0, 0]","Unlike a lot of people who reviewed the show here, I didn't watch it during the `80s, but that was only because I was too young at the time to know it existed.  I discovered it in reruns years later.  Like other reviewers, I enjoy the show because it is much less violent and crude than a lot of newer tv shows, and I think it's a lot more fun, too.  Scarecrow and Mrs. King has a little of everything: action, adventure, comedy, and romance.  Sometimes, it has a bit of mystery, too.The premise of the show is that ""Scarecrow"", a secret agent working for an organization in the Washington D.C. area known only as the ""Agency"", finds himself in a tough spot one day and is forced to ask a civilian, Mrs. King, for help.  Although he thought that their association would end after she completed a small task for him, she ends up helping him much more than he expected and joins the Agency herself, offering a unique point-of-view on things because she understands more about ordinary civilian life than the regular agents do.  At times, the series might seem a little corny because of the way an elite group of trained secret agents comes to rely on an ordinary suburban housewife, but it's all in fun.  Personally, I find the shows hilarious, with the clashes between Mrs. King's nave yet practical approach to situations and Scarecrow's professional experience, particularly since Mrs. King has to go to great lengths to keep her family from finding out that she has become a spy.  At first, Scarecrow and Mrs. King only work together reluctantly, but they eventually become friends and later fall in love.Here is a list of the first season episodes:1. The First Time - Amanda King, divorced mother of two boys, starts off a hectic day by giving her boyfriend a ride to the train station where she is approached by a stranger who tells her that he's a government agent and begs her to deliver a package for him.  This simple task proves much more difficult than it sounds, and Amanda finds herself drawn into the world of espionage with the spy, Lee Stetson, whose codename is Scarecrow.2. There Goes the Neighborhood - Amanda is out job hunting when Lee unexpectedly shows up and recruits her to pose as his wife while he investigates sinister happenings in an ordinary suburban neighborhood.3. If Thoughts Could Kill - Lee is injured when another agent suddenly goes crazy and shoots up the Agency's headquarters. He ends up in the hospital where Amanda has been doing volunteer work and becomes a target of the same brainwashing that caused the other agent to go berserk.4. Magic Bus - The latest in weapons technology is an armored, weaponized vehicle that looks like an ordinary RV.  Lee is assigned to drive it across the country to the testing ground, but it is stolen by members of a survivalist group.5. The ACM Kid - Lee and Amanda have to protect the son of a pair of Russian immigrants who have been kidnapped, not knowing that the boy is a prodigy who is being forced to break into government computers.6. Always Look a Gift Horse in the Mouth - The prince and princess of a Middle Eastern country are visiting the U.S., and the princess wants an average American woman to accompany her on her tour of a local school.  It seems like a simple assignment for Amanda until the princess becomes the target of an assassination attempt.7. Service Above and Beyond - When Lee invites Amanda to a party as part of his cover, she catches the eye of a wealthy man the Agency is investigating.  To get more information about him, they arrange for Amanda to continue to associate with him under another identity, placing her in great personal danger.8. Saved by the Bells - Lee asks Amanda to look after his pet fish while he's on vacation, but that vacation is cancelled suddenly because Amanda is kidnapped by people who assume that she's ""Scarecrow"" since she was in his apartment.9. Sudden Death - Lee goes undercover at a football training camp with Amanda posing as a sports reporter in order to catch an assassin.10. The Long Christmas Eve - A agent who wants to resign demands that the Agency help him to locate the daughter he hasn't seen in years and threatens to reveal information about Agency personnel if they refuse.  Needing to buy time while looking for the real daughter, they convince Amanda to pretend to be his daughter.11. Remembrance of Things Past - Someone is murdering agents of different nationalities in the Washington area, and Lee is the killer's next target.  After barely surviving an attack, Lee pretends to be dead and gets Amanda to help him catch the killer.12. Lost and Found - Lee is helping a researcher in ESP who recently escaped from the Russians to establish a new identity.  Years ago, the researcher married a woman Lee was in love with.  However, Amanda is convinced that the woman is not all that she claims to be.13. I Am Not Now, nor Have I Ever Been... a Spy - Amanda is kidnapped while waiting for Lee at a drop where they are supposed to receive an important message.  She escapes but gets in a car accident which causes her to lose her memories of Lee and the Agency.  Lee has to help her get her memory back and remember what the message was before it's too late.14. Dead Ringer - Amanda has to play hostess to a rather fussy defector who looks a lot like Francine, another woman who works for the Agency.15. The Mole - Someone inside the Agency has been leaking information, and everyone's a suspect.  Lee has been assigned to figure out who it is with Amanda's help.16. Savior - When it looks like Lee has left the Agency to work for some shady arms dealers, Amanda takes it upon herself to convince him to get out the business.17. The Artful Dodger - A suspicious art dealer starts romancing Amanda in order to gain access to government secrets.18. Filming Raul - Unbeknownst to the Agency, their parking lot attendant is an amateur film maker.  The attendant doesn't realize that his films contain some dangerous information until he offers his latest one to Amanda to help catch the guy who hit her car in the parking lot.19. Fearless Dotty - Amanda's mother, Dotty, unwittingly becomes the target of enemy agents after buying the wrong book at the bookstore for Amanda's son's birthday.  Lee and Amanda struggle to keep her safe while Dotty totally fails to notice that she's in any danger.20. Weekend - Lee gets Amanda to come to a fancy resort with him for a weekend to investigate rumors of a kidnapping attempt.  It's only after they get to the resort that he tells her that she's posing as his wife and that they're sharing the same room.21. Waiting for Godorsky - Amanda and her mother respond to a newspaper ad about an estate sale at a mansion and meet a friendly woman who turns out to be a princess fighting against tyranny in her home country and is in danger from assassins.",5,Suburban Spy,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,6848,"['lot', 'people', 'who', 'reviewed', 'show', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', '80s', 'was', 'only', 'was',
