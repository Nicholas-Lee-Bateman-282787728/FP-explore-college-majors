I found this through Netflix, but shied away from it due to the low suggestion rating that it gave me.  After browsing IMDB and finding out that Desmond Harrington (Quinn from Showtime's Dexter) was in it I thought I would give it a shot.  The movie surprised me.  When I thought I had everything figured out they through in a twist.  It was slightly predictable in places, but overall this is a film that I would watch again.

E Jackson,"[1, 2]","The Hole unfortunately suffers from the same problem many suspense and horror films from 1998-2001 suffer from- a serious lack of tension and excitement, or rather, disguising tension and excitement with slow motion effects, loud music and underwhelming writing.  I can't tell you how many films from this specific time period fall under this category.  As a result, these movies *look* impressive but seriously lack substance and feel incomplete from a writing perspective more often than not.Anyway, the only reason I'm not giving the Hole a 1 or 2-star rating is because there is actually a pretty good twist at the end that I didn't see coming judging by the mediocre first hour or so.  The plot is based around a group of teens who, as a joke, asked to be locked inside of an underground bunker, and then after a certain amount of time their friend will come back with they key to unlock them.  For a while the teens are having fun in the bunker getting drunk, stoned and just partying nonstop, however it's soon realized that their friend isn't coming back.Now I WILL give the movie writers credit for one thing- they did a pretty good job with the twist at the end.  Not the most remarkable job in the world, but given the shallow storyline, yeah, it's a surprising turn of events that won me over.  Spoiling the twist would ruin the entire script so... hush hush!  Don't spoil it!Other than focusing on the final 20 minutes of film and that splendid twist, the rest of the writing failed to deliver in the suspense department, which -given the potential for a mighty good movie upon reading the description- is disappointing.  I mean come on- teens are trapped underground and hours turn into days and they're *still* trapped.  They should have been so tense and angry and... I suppose they were to an extent, but the events really don't develop the way I was expecting, and that's not a compliment.  Too much filler pertaining to an overabundance of lackluster and overdramatic segments that accomplish very little.  You know, typical teenager nonsense that's only interesting to people of that age group.Plus the one girl was ALWAYS loud.  The one attractive enough to qualify as a supermodel.  She was always screaming and exaggerating like she expected the world to hand her anything she wants.  Ugh!  The rest of the actors and actresses were good, especially the main character (the other girl).  The lack of suspense and quality writing prevents this film from winning me over.Overall, not a bad film by any means, but definitely not the suspense I was hoping for.",3,takes forever to get good,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,2579,"['Hole', 'unfortunately', 'suffers', 'same', 'problem', 'many', 'suspense', 'horror', 'films', '1998-2001', 'suffer', 'from-', 'serious', 'lack', 'tension', 'excitement', 'rather', 'disguising', 'tension', 'excitement', 'slow', 'motion', 'effects', 'loud', 'music', 'underwhelming', 'writing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'films', 'specific', 'time', 'period', 'fall', 'category', 'result', 'movies', '*look*', 'impressive', 'seriously', 'lack', 'substance', 'feel', 'incomplete', 'writing', 'perspective', 'more', 'often', 'not.Anyway', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'Hole', '1', '2-star', 'rating', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'twist', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'judging', 'mediocre', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'plot', 'based', 'group', 'teens', 'who', 'joke', 'asked', 'be', 'locked', 'underground', 'bunker', 'then', 'certain', 'amount', 'time', 'friend', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'key', 'unlock', 'teens', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'bunker', 'getting', 'drunk', 'stoned', 'just', 'partying', 'nonstop', 'however', 'soon', 'realized', 'friend', ""n't"", 'coming', 'back.Now', 'WILL', 'give', 'movie', 'writers', 'credit', 'one', 'thing-', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'twist', 'end', 'Not', 'most', 'remarkable', 'job', 'world', 'given', 'shallow', 'storyline', 'yeah', 'surprising', 'turn', 'events', 'won', 'over', 'Spoiling', 'twist', 'would', 'ruin', 'entire', 'script', 'so', 'hush', 'hush', 'Do', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'Other', 'focusing', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'splendid', 'twist', 'rest', 'writing', 'failed', 'deliver', 'suspense', 'department', 'potential', 'mighty', 'good', 'movie', 'reading', 'description-', 'disappointing', 'mean', 'come', 'on-', 'teens', 'are', 'trapped', 'underground', 'hours', 'turn', 'days', ""'re"", '*still*', 'trapped', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'tense', 'angry', 'suppose', 'were', 'extent', 'events', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'develop', 'way', 'was', 'expecting', 'not', 'compliment', 'Too', 'much', 'filler', 'pertaining', 'overabundance', 'lackluster', 'overdramatic', 'segments', 'accomplish', 'very', 'little', 'know', 'typical', 'teenager', 'nonsense', 'only', 'interesting', 'people', 'age', 'group.Plus', 'one', 'girl', 'was', 'ALWAYS', 'loud', 'one', 'attractive', 'enough', 'qualify', 'supermodel', 'was', 'always', 'screaming', 'exaggerating', 'expected', 'world', 'hand', 'anything', 'Ugh', 'rest', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'good', 'especially', 'main', 'character', 'other', 'girl', 'lack', 'suspense', 'quality', 'writing', 'prevents', 'film', 'winning', 'over.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'means', 'definitely', 'not', 'suspense', 'was', 'hoping']",N/A

By the time she finally reaches a phone and dials emergency, she is so traumatized that all she can do is scream.What we know is this: over holiday, four prep school students decided to have a very private party in an abandoned underground shelter out in the woods.  They were down there for eighteen days.  But what really happened to them will be revealed gradually over the course of the film as Liz (Thora Birch), the girl from the opening scenes, plays cat and mouse with a psychiatrist (Embeth Davidtz) who is trying to get her to tell her story.This is a twisty thriller with great acting on all parts.  Thora Birch's fake English accent grated on me at first, probably just because I know she's not English, but as the film progressed I didn't notice it so much.  It also becomes clear that she was the right choice for this particular role.The DVD includes director's commentary, in which he talks about sets, censorship, the psychological motivations of the main character, and uses the word ""oblique"" a lot.  It was not exactly lively, but it was moderately interesting.  There are also some deleted scenes and an alternate ending.  The corpselike image of Keira Knightly on the cover of this release is misleading, as she's hardly the star, though her fans will definitely want to check the film out.

While in a local shop though I saw the grim cover and read the back to see what it was about. The way the description made it sound was as though 4 prep school students skipped the scheduled school field trip and went to an abandoned hole where they were locked in and murdered, but no. What happens is far from that. Although I was somewhat disappointed of how the story was portrayed, 20 minutes into the film, I forgot all about it. I don't think this film is outright scary, it's more of a subtle horror. It's a horror that stays with you because of how it could really happen. Films like this are much scarier than the slasher films that are so popular in the horror genre.The story follows Liz and three of her friends. They decide to ditch a school field trip they are convinced will be boring. Liz remembers an abandoned bomb shelter she once was taken to so she thinks this is the best place to hide out and party. Her motive behind this pick is as devilish as her story is.With great acting all around, there's really no reason why this movie won't please people. Keira Knightley springs to mind as one of the most powerful characters in this movie simply because it's such a sinister role for her. Thora Birch from Ghost World fame, did an admirable job as well. She carried the movie much better than I anticipated she would so I was pleased with that aspect. While the guys featured did a good job, I can't help but think they could've casted those particular roles better. Overall though, a nice job.This movie is well worth the price to see it simply because it showed how far one girl will go to be loved. The way Liz went about her obsession with this man is what makes this film frightening. There's no jump out of your seat moments, the tension is what gets you. You never know which direction the story will go next. And I like how they left questions lingering in the end.

The pace of the movie tends to run slow from time to time.  However, if you have nothing else to do, this one is certainly worth watching.Probably, Embeth Davidtz and Thora Birch gave the best performances of the entire casts. Keira Knightley's fans should not be dissapointed though.  While her performance is mediocre, she does show a little bit of herself in this one.Without giving away too much of the plot, the story centers around the lives of a group of priviledged teens in a private school.

767864,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0000ARD7T,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","Before she was engaging in who-can-wear-more-mascara contests with Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley was trapped in a bunker with Thora Birch and two guys for 18 days.  I expected this to be a film about four teens trapped in an underground bunker trying to survive as days turn into weeks (two and a half to be exact), but that really isn't what The Hole is all about.  That fact becomes obvious in the opening scene, as we watch a haggard survivor emerge and shuffle her way back to safety.  Once she begins telling her story, I thought the rest of the movie would just be one big flashback leading us back to the present - wrong again.  The plot to this film is much more dark and insidious as all that - and, while it's not problem-free, I think the film is all the better for it.  This is very much a psychological thriller which almost succeeds magnificently - almost.  And, as unlikely as it may sound, the story plays off the kinds of emotions all of us have experienced - to some degree - at some point in our lives.  Stripped down to the very bone, what you have here is a love story.So here are your choices: go along on a boring school field trip, spend a tedious weekend at home, or sneak away to an underground bunker to party with Keira Knightley and Thora Birch for three days.  I'm a claustrophobic non-rebel, but I would be totally down (pun intended) with hunkering in the bunker.  It certainly seemed like a good idea to Liz Dunn (Birch) because it would give her a chance to spend some quality time with the suddenly available apple of her eye, Mike Steel (Desmond Harrington).  As she eventually tells the psychologist assigned to her (Embeth Davitz), her friend Martyn (Daniel Brocklebank) - one of those unethical brainiacs who can make anything happen - arranged the whole thing, after Mike, Frankie (Knightley), and Geoff (Laurence Fox) solicited his help in getting away for the weekend without either the school or their parents knowing about it.  The plan was a smashing success - except for the fact that Martyn never showed up to unlock the door and let them out.  Clearly, Martyn is the guilty party.But wait a minute - it's not as simple as all that.  Martyn insists that he had nothing to do with any of it, and through him a much different version of events emerges, one that significantly redefines the characters of Liz and Frankie.  Whatever your suspicions, you as the viewer don't really know who or what to believe, especially since you have yet to be told exactly what happened to Mike, Frankie, and Geoff (in fact, I have a little problem with the fact that some of the initial implications are misleading and leave you asking obvious questions you later find out you needn't have asked).  Even after it becomes obvious that one character in particular is not telling the whole story, the sense of mystery remains until the end, when the fates of all are finally revealed.  There's just something about the ending that left me unsatisfied, though - not in terms of everything that took place in the bunker (although one key event was rather obviously foreshadowed early on), but definitely in the way things play out above ground.  That is why, as much as I want to give The Hole five stars in recognition of its creative storytelling prowess and bevy of strong performances, I just can't do it.  It's most unfortunate because I really do love this movie.I do not like the DVD cover featuring the close-up of Keira Knightley, though.  For one thing, she doesn't look anything like this in the movie, but more importantly, this movie is really all about Thora Birch.  Knightley's good, but it is the commanding presence of Birch that largely defines the film as a whole.  With a less capable actress in the lead role, The Hole could have come off as laughably bad.  A subtle facial expression can oftentimes say more than a drawn-out soliloquy, and Birch is unarguably a complete actress.  She can be the girl next door and, at the same time, reveal traces of a hidden dark side - and that makes her not only mysteriously seductive but sexy as hell to those of us who like a little bit of evil in our girls.",4,What happens in the bunker stays in the bunker,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,4144,"['was', 'engaging', 'who-can-wear-more-mascara', 'contests', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'was', 'trapped', 'bunker', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'two', 'guys', '18', 'days', 'expected', 'be', 'film', 'four', 'teens', 'trapped', 'underground', 'bunker', 'trying', 'survive', 'days', 'turn', 'weeks', 'two', 'half', 'be', 'exact', 'really', ""n't"", 'what', 'Hole', 'about', 'fact', 'obvious', 'opening', 'scene', 'watch', 'haggard', 'survivor', 'emerge', 'shuffle', 'way', 'back', 'safety', 'telling', 'story', 'thought', 'rest', 'movie', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'big', 'flashback', 'leading', 'back', 'present', 'wrong', 'again', 'plot', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'dark', 'insidious', 'not', 'problem-free', 'think', 'film', 'better', 'very', 'much', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'almost', 'magnificently', 'almost', 'as', 'unlikely', 'may', 'sound', 'story', 'kinds', 'emotions', 'have', 'experienced', 'degree', 'point', 'lives', 'Stripped', 'down', 'very', 'bone', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'love', 'story.So', 'here', 'are', 'choices', 'go', 'along', 'boring', 'school', 'field', 'trip', 'spend', 'tedious', 'weekend', 'home', 'sneak', 'away', 'underground', 'bunker', 'party', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'three', 'days', ""'m"", 'claustrophobic', 'non-rebel', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'down', 'pun', 'intended', 'hunkering', 'bunker', 'certainly', 'seemed', 'good', 'idea', 'Liz', 'Dunn', 'Birch', 'would', 'give', 'chance', 'spend', 'quality', 'time', 'suddenly', 'available', 'apple', 'eye', 'Mike', 'Steel', 'Desmond', 'Harrington', 'eventually', 'psychologist', 'assigned', 'Embeth', 'Davitz', 'friend', 'Martyn', 'Daniel', 'Brocklebank', 'one', 'unethical', 'brainiacs', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'anything', 'happen', 'arranged', 'whole', 'thing', 'Mike', 'Frankie', 'Knightley', 'Geoff', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'solicited', 'help', 'getting', 'away', 'weekend', 'school', 'parents', 'knowing', 'plan', 'was', 'smashing', 'success', 'fact', 'Martyn', 'never', 'showed', 'unlock', 'door', 'let', 'out', 'Clearly', 'Martyn', 'guilty', 'party.But', 'wait', 'minute', 'not', 'as', 'simple', 'Martyn', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'much', 'different', 'version', 'events', 'emerges', 'one', 'significantly', 'characters', 'Liz', 'Frankie', 'suspicions', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'who', 'what', 'believe', 'especially', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'told', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Mike', 'Frankie', 'Geoff', 'fact', 'have', 'little', 'problem', 'fact', 'initial', 'implications', 'are', 'misleading', 'leave', 'asking', 'obvious', 'questions', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'asked', 'Even', 'obvious', 'one', 'character', 'particular', 'not', 'telling', 'whole', 'story', 'sense', 'mystery', 'end', 'when', 'fates', 'are', 'finally', 'revealed', 'just', 'something', 'ending', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'not', 'terms', 'everything', 'took', 'place', 'bunker', 'one', 'key', 'event', 'was', 'rather', 'obviously', 'foreshadowed', 'early', 'definitely', 'way', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'ground', 'why', 'as', 'much', 'want', 'give', 'Hole', 'five', 'stars', 'recognition', 'creative', 'storytelling', 'prowess', 'bevy', 'strong', 'performances', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'really', 'do', 'love', 'movie.I', 'do', 'not', 'DVD', 'cover', 'featuring', 'close-up', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'though', 'one', 'thing', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'movie', 'more', 'importantly', 'movie', 'really', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Knightley', 'good', 'commanding', 'presence', 'Birch', 'largely', 'film', 'whole', 'less', 'capable', 'actress', 'lead', 'role', 'Hole', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'laughably', 'bad', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expression', 'can', 'oftentimes', 'say', 'more', 'drawn-out', 'soliloquy', 'Birch', 'unarguably', 'complete', 'actress', 'can', 'be', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'same', 'time', 'reveal', 'traces', 'hidden', 'dark', 'side', 'not', 'only', 'mysteriously', 'seductive', 'sexy', 'hell', 'who', 'little', 'bit', 'evil', 'girls']",N/A
767865,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B0000ARD7T,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[7, 11]","`The Hole' is not a movie I would normally be interested in. In fact, as I was watching this low budget British production I found myself reflecting on how a film producer friend of mine would find the movie an absolute treat with her penchant for independent movies and rather quirky storylines.So what initially attracted me to this movie. Well it can be summed up in two words - `Keira' and `Knightley.' Yes, I am among the legions of fans that the young British actress has acquired since I first noticed her as Gwyn in the Disney movie `Princess of Thieves.' So, I sat down with a copy of one of her pre-fame films `The Hole' and prepared to indulge myself in a little Knightley admiration.First of all, Keira may not be the star of the movie but her presence is felt throughout. She provides a perfect contrast to Thora Birch's character for whereas Knightley is flamboyant, cheerful and over all popular with the guys, Birch is moody, withdrawn and manipulative - I guess the dictum `opposites attract' held true in their somewhat mixed-up friendship.The story revolves around four students at a rather preppy British private school who decide to spend three days inside an abandoned bomb shelter deep in the woods with an aim to partying and avoiding a dreaded geography field trip to Wales.Yet, Birch's motivations are even deeper. Among the four students will be an American guy, one she has her eyes set on and she sees the time in `the hole' as an opportunity to get closer to him.But, when the three days are up the four find themselves trapped in the underground shelter and as tempers fray and the supplies dwindle, events begin to spiral out of control and emotions run the gamut before all is revealed.The movie attempts to confuse and mislead the viewer for most of the first half of the picture and we have two ""witnesses"" with wildly different accounts of the earlier events that led to the four being down in the shelter. However, this viewer had it all figured out within minutes of the movie opening (as I also did with `The Sixth Sense') so it's hard to say exactly how successful the producers were.Performances are universally excellent by all concerned and yes, this is the only movie so far in which Knightley does appear topless (blink and you'll miss it though).This is a quirky, strange movie and a well crafted thriller. Its definitely a must for fans of independent movies, Knightley and people who like intense plot twists.",4,The movie where Keira goes topless is a good quirky thriller,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,2457,"['Hole', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'interested', 'fact', 'was', 'watching', 'low', 'budget', 'British', 'production', 'found', 'reflecting', 'how', 'film', 'producer', 'friend', 'mine', 'would', 'find', 'movie', 'absolute', 'treat', 'penchant', 'independent', 'movies', 'rather', 'quirky', 'storylines.So', 'what', 'initially', 'attracted', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'two', 'words', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Yes', 'am', 'legions', 'fans', 'young', 'British', 'actress', 'acquired', 'first', 'noticed', 'Gwyn', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Princess', 'Thieves', 'So', 'sat', 'down', 'copy', 'one', 'pre-fame', 'films', 'Hole', 'prepared', 'indulge', 'little', 'Knightley', 'admiration.First', 'Keira', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'star', 'movie', 'presence', 'felt', 'perfect', 'contrast', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'character', 'whereas', 'Knightley', 'flamboyant', 'cheerful', 'popular', 'guys', 'Birch', 'moody', 'withdrawn', 'manipulative', 'guess', 'dictum', 'attract', 'held', 'true', 'somewhat', 'mixed-up', 'friendship.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'four', 'students', 'rather', 'preppy', 'British', 'private', 'school', 'who', 'decide', 'spend', 'three', 'days', 'abandoned', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'deep', 'woods', 'aim', 'partying', 'avoiding', 'dreaded', 'geography', 'field', 'trip', 'Wales.Yet', 'Birch', 'motivations', 'are', 'even', 'deeper', 'four', 'students', 'will', 'be', 'American', 'guy', 'one', 'eyes', 'set', 'time', 'hole', 'opportunity', 'get', 'closer', 'him.But', 'when', 'three', 'days', 'are', 'up', 'four', 'find', 'trapped', 'underground', 'shelter', 'tempers', 'fray', 'supplies', 'dwindle', 'events', 'begin', 'spiral', 'control', 'emotions', 'run', 'gamut', 'revealed.The', 'movie', 'attempts', 'confuse', 'mislead', 'viewer', 'most', 'first', 'half', 'picture', 'have', 'two', 'witnesses', 'wildly', 'different', 'accounts', 'earlier', 'events', 'led', 'four', 'being', 'down', 'shelter', 'However', 'viewer', 'had', 'all', 'figured', 'out', 'minutes', 'movie', 'opening', 'also', 'did', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'hard', 'say', 'exactly', 'how', 'successful', 'producers', 'were.Performances', 'are', 'universally', 'excellent', 'concerned', 'yes', 'only', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'Knightley', 'appear', 'topless', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', '.This', 'quirky', 'strange', 'movie', 'well', 'crafted', 'thriller', 'definitely', 'must', 'fans', 'independent', 'movies', 'Knightley', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'intense', 'plot', 'twists']",N/A

Bernabo,"[57, 62]","Four English prep school students decide to skip a weekend field trip and hide out in an abandoned bomb shelter where they can hang out and party all night long.  Sure, this sounds sort of stupid, but these teenagers see it as the best private party of their life, ""absolutely extra curricular"" as one of them puts it.  However, when the weekend is over and the door is supposed to open it does not, and the four find out that they are locked in.  Who locked them in?  Will they be discovered?  Can they find another way out?  What will happen when they run out of food and water?  How long before they start to turn on each other?Since the film opens with one of the four stumbling into the deserted school we know that they were down in that hole for eighteen days.  However, the expectation that this 2001 film will take us back through those 18 days from start to finish quickly turns out to be a false one.  ""The Hole"" is more of a mystery than a survival drama.  The teenager who stumbled into the school, Liz Dunn (Thora Birch), is seeing a psychologist, Dr. Philippa Horwood (Embeth Davidtz), who is trying to find out what happened.  Liz tells the story of what happened, but Horwood knows that it is not the truth and that the girl has sanitized it as a way of preserving her sanity.  We know the story is not the truth because when the group descends into the bomb shelter director Nick Hamm keeps focusing on a part of the chain ladder that is obviously dangerously week.  It plays not part in Liz's story, so we will just have to keep revisiting the story until it does.In addition to Liz the others in the hole are Mike Steel (Desmond Harrington), the spoiled son of an American rock star whom Liz has a crush on, Frankie Smith (Keira Knightley), Liz's best friend, and Geoff Bingham (Laurence Fox), who really more of Frankie's potential boy toy than actual boyfriend.  The quartet are brought to the bomb shelter by Martyn Taylor (Daniel Brocklebank), the male friend of Liz's who wants to be more than a friend.  He is the obvious suspect for why the four kids are locked in the hole, especially for DCS Tom Howard (Steven Waddington), but obvious means little in this film.While the mystery of ""what really happened"" gets in the way from time to time because since we know Liz's first story is not the truth we have to question everything that comes after that point, there are some horrific moments in this film having to do with being locked in a hole to die.  In that regard ""The Hole"" has a couple of gruesome moments that are going to stick with you, having more of a visceral effect than the blood and gore associated with all the slick money-making Hollywood horror movies (I also have to comment that all the adolescent males who check out this film because they heard Keira Knightley does nudity are going to be disappointed twice, the first time because of brevity and the second because of context).  There are also moments of how horrible human beings can be, such as when Liz talks while Frankie is puking her guts out.""The Hole"" makes excellent use of the simple but ominous music by Clint Mansell even before the company credit fades to black and the opening credits are revealed by the trembling, searching beam of a flashlight.  I think this film certainly gets you hooked, and how much you like it in the end will depend entirely on your satisfaction with the explanation for why this happened.  For me it was just a bit too cute and undercut the horror show aspects, taking us back to an area that has been overdone in such films.  But it certainly does have its moments, all of them being in the hole and not back in the real world, and avoids the rampant stupidity that afflicts so many movies in this genre.  The result is not great, but it is well above average and for anybody looking for something new to watch to creep them out on Halloween night this year, ""The Hole"" should not disappoint.",4,Four teenagers locked in an abandoned bomb shelter...,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,3935,"['Four', 'English', 'prep', 'school', 'students', 'decide', 'skip', 'weekend', 'field', 'trip', 'hide', 'out', 'abandoned', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'where', 'can', 'hang', 'out', 'party', 'night', 'long', 'Sure', 'sort', 'stupid', 'teenagers', 'see', 'best', 'private', 'party', 'life', 'absolutely', 'extra', 'curricular', 'one', 'However', 'when', 'weekend', 'door', 'supposed', 'open', 'not', 'four', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'locked', 'Who', 'locked', 'Will', 'be', 'discovered', 'Can', 'find', 'way', 'out', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'run', 'food', 'water', 'How', 'long', 'start', 'turn', 'other', 'film', 'one', 'four', 'stumbling', 'deserted', 'school', 'know', 'were', 'down', 'hole', 'eighteen', 'days', 'However', 'expectation', '2001', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'back', '18', 'days', 'start', 'finish', 'quickly', 'out', 'be', 'false', 'one', 'Hole', 'more', 'mystery', 'survival', 'drama', 'teenager', 'who', 'stumbled', 'school', 'Liz', 'Dunn', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'seeing', 'psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Philippa', 'Horwood', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Liz', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'Horwood', 'not', 'truth', 'girl', 'sanitized', 'way', 'preserving', 'sanity', 'know', 'story', 'not', 'truth', 'when', 'group', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'director', 'Nick', 'Hamm', 'focusing', 'part', 'chain', 'ladder', 'obviously', 'dangerously', 'week', 'not', 'part', 'Liz', 'story', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'keep', 'revisiting', 'story', 'addition', 'Liz', 'others', 'hole', 'are', 'Mike', 'Steel', 'Desmond', 'Harrington', 'spoiled', 'son', 'American', 'rock', 'star', 'whom', 'Liz', 'crush', 'Frankie', 'Smith', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Liz', 'best', 'friend', 'Geoff', 'Bingham', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'who', 'really', 'more', 'Frankie', 'potential', 'boy', 'toy', 'actual', 'boyfriend', 'quartet', 'are', 'brought', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'Martyn', 'Taylor', 'Daniel', 'Brocklebank', 'male', 'friend', 'Liz', 'who', 'be', 'more', 'friend', 'obvious', 'suspect', 'why', 'four', 'kids', 'are', 'locked', 'hole', 'especially', 'DCS', 'Tom', 'Howard', 'Steven', 'Waddington', 'obvious', 'means', 'little', 'film.While', 'mystery', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'way', 'time', 'time', 'know', 'Liz', 'first', 'story', 'not', 'truth', 'have', 'question', 'everything', 'point', 'are', 'horrific', 'moments', 'film', 'having', 'do', 'being', 'locked', 'hole', 'die', 'regard', 'Hole', 'couple', 'gruesome', 'moments', 'are', 'going', 'stick', 'having', 'more', 'visceral', 'effect', 'blood', 'gore', 'associated', 'slick', 'money-making', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'movies', 'also', 'have', 'comment', 'adolescent', 'males', 'who', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'heard', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'nudity', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'twice', 'first', 'time', 'brevity', 'second', 'context', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'how', 'horrible', 'human', 'beings', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'when', 'Liz', 'talks', 'Frankie', 'puking', 'guts', 'out', 'Hole', 'excellent', 'use', 'simple', 'ominous', 'music', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'even', 'company', 'credit', 'fades', 'black', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'revealed', 'trembling', 'searching', 'beam', 'flashlight', 'think', 'film', 'certainly', 'hooked', 'how', 'much', 'end', 'will', 'depend', 'entirely', 'satisfaction', 'explanation', 'why', 'happened', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'cute', 'undercut', 'horror', 'show', 'taking', 'back', 'area', 'been', 'overdone', 'such', 'films', 'certainly', 'have', 'moments', 'being', 'hole', 'not', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'rampant', 'stupidity', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'genre', 'result', 'not', 'great', 'well', 'above', 'average', 'anybody', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'watch', 'creep', 'out', 'Halloween', 'night', 'year', 'Hole', 'should', 'not', 'disappoint']",N/A

Birch accuses a fellow student (Daniel Brocklebank) of locking them inside and leaving them to die, but Brocklebank provides another - even more sinister - version of events. Which one is lying?Nick Hamm's low-key shocker is less a horror film than a study of psychological torment, as a group of foolhardy youngsters are caught up in a situation beyond their control. The inevitable explosions of violence are brief but potent, and the script (penned by debut writers Ben Court and Caroline Ip, based on Guy Burt's novel 'After the Hole') keeps viewers guessing about the villain's true identity until the proverbial last minute.

767882,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B0000ARD7T,Matthew King,"[10, 10]","While it has just recently been released on our shores, ""The Hole"" is actually a British film dating from 2001.  I'm not sure why it took so long for this to be released here since it's actually quite an accessible picture and resembles many American suspense films in terms of its look and formula.  One thing that might have to do with its sudden US release is due to the emergence of rising star Keira Knightley, who has appeared in such films as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""King Arthur"".  While having her face exclusively featured on the cover might be a bit misleading (her screen time clocks in at about 20 mns and Thora Birch is clearly the focus of the film) her fans will not be disappointed.  She looks stunning of course and it's hard to believe she was only 16 when she appeared in this film.""The Hole"" starts off with a teenager named Liz (Thora Birch) limping her way back into civilization after having spent the last 18 days in an underground bunker.  Liz is assigned to a doctor/sociologist and recounts the events that led to her and 3 of her friends being trapped into the bunker.  As Liz's story unfolds, it becomes apparent to the doctor that certain things are being left out and that unmasking the identity of the person responsible for locking the kids in the bunker is more complex than originally thought...More a thriller than a horror film, ""The Hole"" is loaded with twists and turns and red herrings.  It has a non-linear structure and much of it takes place after the climactic events of the teenagers being trapped in the hole.  What makes it an intriguing watch is that you never know who to trust as you're watching, and keep wondering whether Liz is a victim or a psychotic.  Also, since it involves events being recalled in the past about a police case not yet closed, the film benefits of a double-mystery where the viewer is wondering what really happened in that bunker and what is about to happen next (who will get arrested, who died, etc.).  The acting is excellent and the film does a great job of freaking out the viewer by creating a rising dread of claustrophobia and rapidly deteriorating living conditions.So for the most part this film is very effective and highly watcheable.  What bothered me a little bit was how dumb the concept really was: how stupid do you have to be to go down into a bunker and have someone close the lid on you and keep the key?  And while this film is very entertaining upon first viewing, it pretty much dooms itself of any repeat value once the mystery is unveiled.  So although ""The Hole"" is an entertaining film I would really consider it more as a rental due to the fact it won't likely stand well to repeat viewings.

Although filmed in the UK, it's never exactly mentioned where in England, and there's not a lot featured about the school.This very recently had its UK premier on TV, and was described as being the &quot;TV edit&quot; - which means all the swearing, nudity, general naughty bits being chopped. While I wasn't exactly delirious about seeing it (the reviews in the TV pages weren't that good), my dad was. So I borrowed the DVD (it was a toss-up between this or Memoirs of An Invisible Man tough choice), and sat down, ready to get my claws into Thora Birch. Despite starring in a film where she doesn't get a chance to smile one bit, and doesn't get to wear loads of makeup (which makes her lots prettier), she was a great actress in this, one of her best roles I've seen since Ghost World. Also starring Keira Knightley, pretending to be 15 (when she was at least 2 years older) and the not-so-lovely Desmond Harrington (he was a lot cuter in Ghost Ship), the rest of the cast seem to be relative unknowns.If you're a trailer watcher (like moi) the trailer for this, will set you up thinking you're gonna be watching some standard slasher flick. Prepare to be shocked. It's anything but a slasher flick - although it is in some senses. It depends whose eyes you see it through.The film opens with a very shocked Thora Birch, wandering around, surrounded by 'Missing' posters, and covered in blood. I originally thought that she'd been raped or something (judging by the trailer). In the scenes following, she's given an internal examination, which will make any girl cross her legs, and make her never want to have her first smear.Keira Knightley, playing the spoilt brat in this, a role she would later play in Pirates of the Caribbean, was OK, although she looks loads better as a brunette, rather than the blonde she plays in this. There's been a general uproar, about the fact she was supposed to be 15 in this, and she gets her not-so-ample chest out. When in fact, she's trying to remain a teenager, and is the more believable age of 21. (And is already trying to stay young and beautiful, by having collagen injections in her lips - which she's confirmed - and Botox - which she's denied) This was filmed before she shot to fame as Jules in Bend It Like Beckham, and I would have said this should have made her the nations darling. She's one of the girls at school, many others and I hated. She was beautiful enough to get the guy - any guy - and leave Thora Birch trailing her wake.What really gets me about the film, is the smoking. You're trapped in a confined space, and if you're a non-smoker (which none of them seemed to be), then it wouldn't be pretty. It really disappointed me to see both girls smoking (why don't these people have any sense?)I'm a person who tries to second guess who's the killer etc, in these kinda films, and normally I'm wrong, but in this, I was half right. There are two sides to the story, so you'll also be trying to guess who's telling the correct story. And the trailer gives the impression that there's someone else in the hole with them, when there isn't. So the trailer is for a completely different film.The sex scenes are unbelievable to say the least. Not necessarily between Keira Knightley and the other guy, but between Thora Birch and Desmond Harrington. No matter how much she thinks she loves him, if he did what he did to Thora to me (give me half a chance), it would be a complete turn off. It's just not sexy. But you can't exactly blame them - they're trying to sleep with a couple going at it like rabbits. You're gonna want some of what they're having!Alongside Thirteen Ghosts, this is one of the scariest movies I've seen. I was jumping, covering my mouth, dying for someone to cling to (when there was no one), and begging it to stop soon! I was totally shocked when it ended, and sitting watching a torch shine over the credits, I noticed it was based on a novel by Guy Burt. I'm a sucker for those things, so I was straight online looking for it. As yet, I still haven't managed to order it, as the prices are quite good, but it's the reprints that are available (to tie in with the movie) and the original cannot be found. Plus, it's all shipping from the good old US of A - so it's fairly decent prices for the book, until you look at the shipping prices to the UK. Who do I have to kill to get this book dead cheap?! Or do I have to sell my kidney?Ignore the bad reviews for this movie, cos I loved it! Genuinely creepy, you're never sure what's gonna happen, with the constant twists and turns.

Thora Birch is Liz, a somewhat eccentric teenager, who opens the movie stumbling through town and screaming into a telephone for help.  What happened?  According to Liz, a friend of hers had agreed to lock Liz and three of her friends in an old abandoned military bunker so that Liz could get the hunky American student to fall in love with her.  However, the friend never shows up to let them out and they are imprisoned in the hole for two weeks.  A concerned psychiatrist tries to get the truth out of Liz, and as the movie descends into its maelstrom of obsessive love and hidden secrets, THE HOLE becomes a gripping exercise in terror.

However, the flaws really murdered this movie. As always, my reviews are usually against the other reviewers in many cases and I do not write reviews to gain ratings or am I paid to write glowing fake reviews.1. The acting is never to the extreme which this movie needs. The whole mood in general doesn't stir much freight into the audience since the movie is continuously hit with mediocre dialogue that keeps the story going, but doesn't spark a fire.2. The movie tries to add a bit of a twist, but the twist was so lacking and badly executed that the ending didn't feel very satisfying because a little before the midway point, you already realize who is the real bad guy and what the potential outcome would be. There is a slight twist towards the very end, but like I said, it was significantly dampened by the badly executed plot twist. A movie like this should keep you reguessing your thoughts again and again, this movie not so much.3. I was expecting a lot of gore, especially based on the trailer. I was mistaken of course, there's actually no real gore at all, actually there's not too much action as well or extreme conditions. The movie carried on at an extremely leisurely pace, especially for this type of movie I would expect.The acting and directing was decent, I was mildly interested, hoping the movie would pick up. I've seen worse movies, but I would not watch this again. It's just not worth it.

767891,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0000ARD7T,Only-A-Child,"[33, 36]","Caution:  Spoilers Ahead!!  You may wish to view the movie and then read this analysis.I have to credit IMDB for my discovery of this fascinating film, as the number of comments posted about ""The Saw"" proclaiming it a poor imitation of ""The Hole"" convinced me to purchase the DVD.  Not a particularly hard sell because Thora Birch is rapidly climbing to the top of my most talented actress list; so watch out Mia Kirshner and Sarah Polley.What I especially like now about this former child actress is her ability to de-tune her sexiness.  This allows her to believably-physically play the ""plain Jane"" to beauties like Scarlett Johansson and Kiera Knightley, while on another level actually being sexier.  The appeal of this is that it allows you to imagine that you are the only one in the audience picking up on that other level, thereby making it seem like a exclusive connection.As has already been much discussed, the trailer for ""The Hole"" is completely wrong for the movie, making it seem like a slasher film when it a subtle psychological thriller of obsession and misdirection.  It illustrates what obsession  can produce when taken a step too far.  Probably the most chilling scene is the nightclub rest room parody where Liz (Birch) is gleefully prattling on about her seduction of Mike to her girlfriend Frankie (Knightley), utterly oblivious and unconcerned that Frankie is deathly ill.Another great scene is the  one used by the director to set up Liz's friend Martin for the blame,  Liz is speaking to Martin about what it is like to love someone but not have them know you exist. Martin says everything with his face as he lets you know that this just how he feels about Liz.Director Nick Hamm has pieced together a textbook example of misdirection and the ability of filmmakers to show you only what they want you to see.  All the flashbacks (and there are a lot) are POV situations with varying degrees of truth.  In this regard Hamm is quite respectful of the audience, manipulating the viewer up to a point but then allowing them free rein to invest each development with their own interpretation.  Some have found the ending too predictable because it does not have a twist.  But twists have become so obligatory that no twist is a twist.  Having Liz win in the end and then going out on her eye contact is simply perfect.  Not only does this parallel her claim to have finally picked the lock and escaped, it gives the kind off kilter resolution that the film needs for structural unity.  If Peyton had won in ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"", that film would have been a classic instead of just another example of a thriller than ultimately falls short.""The Hole"" is really more character study than thriller, and the character of Liz with her obsession and evolving motivations is as compelling as Hitchcock's ""Marnie"".  Liz does not plan the deaths of her schoolmates, she is just desperately going after something and things happen.  She gets herself trapped in the situation and just goes with it because after a point she has no way out.  The two scenes where Mike cruelly rejects her are riveting as Birch artfully starts to show us that Liz is wrapped a little too tight-something no one expected until that point. After that her character's issues are slowly revealed layer by layer.It is interesting that even after those rejections, if Mike had just agreed to go with her for pizza, she would not have locked the exit.  Ironically, a bit later his tender support of her causes her to postpone unlocking the exit. This kind of on-the-fence waiting to topple structure makes this a cerebral film viewing exercise.While not normal, Liz is believable.  Mike's death disturbs her but on reflection she realizes that it is actually for the best.  She was able to get him to fall in love with her but is realistic enough even in her madness to realize that they had no future together.  She is pretty much insane after leaving the hole but as she recovers her memory the instinct for self-preservation kicks in.Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",5,Great But Not for Everyone,1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,4083,"['Caution', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead', 'may', 'wish', 'view', 'movie', 'then', 'read', 'analysis.I', 'have', 'credit', 'IMDB', 'discovery', 'fascinating', 'film', 'number', 'comments', 'posted', 'Saw', 'proclaiming', 'poor', 'imitation', 'Hole', 'convinced', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'Not', 'particularly', 'hard', 'sell', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'rapidly', 'climbing', 'top', 'most', 'talented', 'actress', 'list', 'so', 'watch', 'out', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'Sarah', 'Polley.What', 'especially', 'now', 'former', 'child', 'actress', 'ability', 'de-tune', 'sexiness', 'believably-physically', 'play', 'plain', 'Jane', 'beauties', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'level', 'actually', 'being', 'sexier', 'appeal', 'imagine', 'are', 'only', 'one', 'audience', 'picking', 'up', 'other', 'level', 'thereby', 'making', 'seem', 'exclusive', 'connection.As', 'already', 'been', 'much', 'discussed', 'trailer', 'Hole', 'completely', 'wrong', 'movie', 'making', 'seem', 'slasher', 'film', 'when', 'subtle', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'obsession', 'misdirection', 'what', 'obsession', 'can', 'produce', 'when', 'taken', 'step', 'too', 'far', 'Probably', 'most', 'chilling', 'scene', 'nightclub', 'rest', 'room', 'parody', 'where', 'Liz', 'Birch', 'gleefully', 'prattling', 'seduction', 'Mike', 'girlfriend', 'Frankie', 'Knightley', 'utterly', 'oblivious', 'unconcerned', 'Frankie', 'deathly', 'ill.Another', 'great', 'scene', 'one', 'used', 'director', 'set', 'up', 'Liz', 'friend', 'Martin', 'blame', 'Liz', 'speaking', 'Martin', 'what', 'love', 'someone', 'not', 'have', 'know', 'exist', 'Martin', 'everything', 'face', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'Liz.Director', 'Nick', 'Hamm', 'pieced', 'together', 'textbook', 'example', 'misdirection', 'ability', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'only', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'lot', 'are', 'POV', 'situations', 'varying', 'degrees', 'truth', 'regard', 'Hamm', 'quite', 'respectful', 'audience', 'manipulating', 'viewer', 'up', 'point', 'then', 'allowing', 'free', 'rein', 'invest', 'development', 'own', 'interpretation', 'have', 'found', 'ending', 'too', 'predictable', 'not', 'have', 'twist', 'twists', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'obligatory', 'twist', 'twist', 'Having', 'Liz', 'win', 'end', 'then', 'going', 'out', 'eye', 'contact', 'simply', 'perfect', 'Not', 'only', 'parallel', 'claim', 'have', 'finally', 'picked', 'lock', 'escaped', 'kind', 'kilter', 'resolution', 'film', 'needs', 'structural', 'unity', 'Peyton', 'had', 'won', 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'instead', 'just', 'example', 'thriller', 'ultimately', 'short', 'Hole', 'really', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'thriller', 'character', 'Liz', 'obsession', 'evolving', 'motivations', 'as', 'compelling', 'Hitchcock', 'Marnie', 'Liz', 'not', 'plan', 'deaths', 'schoolmates', 'just', 'desperately', 'going', 'something', 'things', 'happen', 'trapped', 'situation', 'just', 'point', 'way', 'out', 'two', 'scenes', 'where', 'Mike', 'cruelly', 'are', 'riveting', 'Birch', 'artfully', 'show', 'Liz', 'wrapped', 'little', 'too', 'tight-something', 'one', 'expected', 'point', 'character', 'issues', 'are', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'layer', 'layer.It', 'interesting', 'even', 'rejections', 'Mike', 'had', 'just', 'agreed', 'go', 'pizza', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'locked', 'exit', 'Ironically', 'bit', 'later', 'tender', 'support', 'causes', 'postpone', 'unlocking', 'exit', 'kind', 'on-the-fence', 'waiting', 'topple', 'structure', 'cerebral', 'film', 'viewing', 'exercise.While', 'not', 'normal', 'Liz', 'believable', 'Mike', 'death', 'reflection', 'actually', 'best', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'fall', 'love', 'realistic', 'enough', 'even', 'madness', 'realize', 'had', 'future', 'together', 'pretty', 'much', 'insane', 'leaving', 'hole', 'memory', 'instinct', 'self-preservation', 'kicks', 'in.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",N/A

In this instance, it was Keira Kinghtley and I was backtracking her older films and came across &quot;The Hole.&quot;Upon watching this film, I found it quite enjoyable. The casting was well done, however Thora Birch looked like the only actress convincing as being about age 15...Keira looked about 19 or so, but oh well. The story was intriguing, leading to some second-guessing. If you've seen &quot;Basic,&quot; this sorta the same type of pyschological thriller, just a different setting and different circumstances. Cinematography was alright, but nothing special. I did notice a few, minor no-no's for how actors were captured in close up shots, but it's negligable.Being a foreign film, it's obvious not too much can be expected in terms of the film's scope. The same musical piece was used a lot, and there was a lot of simplicity in things. Oh, and be aware that I guess British films aren't that stiff about nudity ratings like the US, so be prepared for a fair amount of nudity...a lil more than I was expecting, but I guess that goes to show you how strict the US rating system is, and thus what we've been raised upon... quite a shock.Overall, I was pleased with this film... quite solid and not too long.

767899,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000ARD7T,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 10]","This is a British thriller released back in 2001, starring Thora Birch, Desmond Harrington, Laurence Fox, Keira Knightley, Daniel Brocklebank, and Embeth Davidtz.  The director is Nick Hamm ('The Very Thought of You'), and the film is based on a book 'After the Hole' by Guy Burt.The reason of much delayed release in USA is understandable, for the film is often disturbing, and not always successful in disturbing us as thriller.  Yes, this is a thriller set in British publish school, and the original writer was a student of one such school, as the film would show.THE STORY begins brilliantly.  Four students of one public school have been missing for 18 days, and only one of them comes back.  It is Liz (Thora Birch), and Dr. Philippa (Davidtz) is chosen as counselor for her, asking her what happened to her, and other three students.And what happened?  This is the point of the film, which I refuse to disclose, except that Liz is the key to the truth, and the truth is very relative, as the doctor is about to find.The other three students are played by Fox, Harriongton, and Knightley;  two handsome guys popular among the students (and one of them is a son of rock star!), and a cheerleader-type cool beauty.  As you see from my words, Keira Knightley's role is pretty negative one, miles away from her in 'Bend it Like Beckham' or 'Pirates of the Carribiean.'  So, beware, fans.As a thriller, 'The Hole' is too unbelievable, whether on the factual level, or the phychological one.  It fares well first, but then gradually is derailed more and more, and the conclusion is, sorry people, just laughable.  You may think, Can this person really do this?  Can this character is so stupid not to realize that?  And first of all, the premise that four kids missing for 18 days is too incredible, given the fact that is revealed at the latter half of the film.  I don't believe that, and worse still, the film is not convincing enough to make me.ACTING AND MUSIC are the best part of the film, especially that of Thora Birch, who was marvellous in 'Ghost World.'  She is marvellous too here, but not the same way, showing many sides of the character she plays, displaying the wide range of her skills.  Compared with her, Keira Knightley is put in a disadvantageous position, because her character, like 'Queen-of-the-prom,' is given less chance to impress in any other way than that.Oh, and the original soundtrack music is given by Clint Mansell ('Pai'), and his mesmerising score at the opening section is not to be missed.Not a great thriller as a whole, but worth seeing the parts the film includes, 'The Hole' is over-written, but decently done film.  But you may dislike it after seeing it, the way it treats lovely Keira Knightley in particular.",3,Decent but Incredible Thriller (Beware Keira Knightley Fan),1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,2757,"['British', 'thriller', 'released', 'back', '2001', 'starring', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Desmond', 'Harrington', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Daniel', 'Brocklebank', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'director', 'Nick', 'Hamm', 'Very', 'Thought', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Hole', 'Guy', 'Burt.The', 'reason', 'much', 'delayed', 'release', 'USA', 'understandable', 'film', 'often', 'disturbing', 'not', 'always', 'successful', 'disturbing', 'thriller', 'Yes', 'thriller', 'set', 'British', 'publish', 'school', 'original', 'writer', 'was', 'student', 'one', 'such', 'school', 'film', 'would', 'show.THE', 'STORY', 'brilliantly', 'Four', 'students', 'one', 'public', 'school', 'have', 'been', 'missing', '18', 'days', 'only', 'one', 'back', 'Liz', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Dr.', 'Philippa', 'Davidtz', 'chosen', 'counselor', 'asking', 'what', 'happened', 'other', 'three', 'students.And', 'what', 'happened', 'point', 'film', 'refuse', 'disclose', 'Liz', 'key', 'truth', 'truth', 'very', 'relative', 'doctor', 'find.The', 'other', 'three', 'students', 'are', 'played', 'Fox', 'Harriongton', 'Knightley', 'two', 'handsome', 'guys', 'popular', 'students', 'one', 'son', 'rock', 'star', 'cheerleader-type', 'cool', 'beauty', 'see', 'words', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'role', 'pretty', 'negative', 'one', 'miles', 'away', ""'Bend"", 'Beckham', ""'Pirates"", 'Carribiean', 'So', 'beware', 'fans.As', 'thriller', 'Hole', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'factual', 'level', 'phychological', 'one', 'well', 'first', 'then', 'gradually', 'derailed', 'more', 'more', 'conclusion', 'sorry', 'people', 'just', 'laughable', 'may', 'think', 'Can', 'person', 'really', 'do', 'Can', 'character', 'so', 'stupid', 'not', 'realize', 'first', 'premise', 'four', 'kids', 'missing', '18', 'days', 'too', 'incredible', 'given', 'fact', 'revealed', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'worse', 'still', 'film', 'not', 'convincing', 'enough', 'make', 'me.ACTING', 'MUSIC', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'especially', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'who', 'was', 'marvellous', ""'Ghost"", 'World', 'marvellous', 'too', 'here', 'not', 'same', 'way', 'showing', 'many', 'sides', 'character', 'displaying', 'wide', 'range', 'skills', 'Compared', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'put', 'disadvantageous', 'position', 'character', ""'Queen-of-the-prom"", 'given', 'less', 'chance', 'impress', 'other', 'way', 'that.Oh', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'given', 'Clint', 'Mansell', ""'Pai"", 'mesmerising', 'score', 'opening', 'section', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Not', 'great', 'thriller', 'whole', 'seeing', 'parts', 'film', 'Hole', 'over-written', 'decently', 'done', 'film', 'may', 'dislike', 'seeing', 'way', 'lovely', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'particular']",N/A
767900,A1WL2EKE4TAEJP,B0000ARD7T,"Tyler Durden ""Mutton Man""","[3, 5]","Keira Knightley fans may get a kick out of this movie since she is topless for a split second. But for the movie as a whole, you may feel slightly disappointed or moderately pleased. Short plot snypnosis: four hormone-driven teens ditch a scheduled school field trip to party out in an abandoned bomb shelter, an event that goes terribly awry when they are trapped in this ""hole,"" which gets gut-wrenchingly disturbing as days go by.Of course, sex, drugs, drinking, and just pure partying is what goes on in that ""hole."" But once they realized that they're locked in, everyone starts going insane, which leads to deaths. Only one person managed to escape the hell-hole. A girl named Liz (Thora Burch). You think I already gave too much away? You'll know right away once you see the first five minutes of the movie when we see her walking around, obviously tramautized. She then tells the story, which results in numerous flashbacks. But then things get a lil' twisted when another person argues that her story is completely inaccurate and false. For a good half of the movie, we are falsely informed of the event. Now our story gets rolling through pieces of flashbacks...The movie's theme revolves around obsession and one's desperate way to get what he/she really wants by any means necessary. Liz wants to get the attention of the boy she adores but can't seem to acheive such desire. She's like the ""social outcast"" type. The ""weird"" one... kinda like the other character she played in ""American Beauty,"" only with a more demented mind and soul. You may love her or hate her, or express both feelings simultaneously, particularly in a scene where Liz is calmly talking to Frankie (Keira Knightley), who is just puking her guts out in a bathroom. Liz doesn't express any emotion and doesn't seem to care for Frankie. Man, talk about how horrible humans can be. The movie also stars Desmond Harrington(from ""Wrong Turn"" and ""Ghost Ship"") as Mike, the boy Liz has a deep crush on, and Laurence Fox as Geoff, Frankie's love interest. Altogether, they provide good acting as a group of friends trying desperately to survive.You'll be shocked, you'll be disgusted, but most likely, you'll at least enjoy this movie. I wouldn't consider it a psychological thriller since ""To Die For"" (with Nicole Kidman) also had a similar theme, but I guess what makes it a psychological thriller is that it makes us think and try to figure out what really went wrong in that hole, why the teens were trapped down there, and who would be so cruel as to leave them remained trapped there. Love it or hate it, you'll feel disturbed for quite a while. That's what I felt. I liked it, but at the same time I disliked it, particularly of the movie's weak plot, but it's still amazing that a good thriller came out of such a topic, even if it went over the top.The DVD doesn't have much extra stuff. Just some ho-hum deleted scenes and a commentary. And for some reason, on the back of the case, it reads ""Widescreen (2.35:1)"" when the movie is actually presented in a 1.85:1 ratio. I dunno... it could only be my copy.The tagline on the US reads ""Once you get in, you can't get out,"" whereas the British version reads ""Desperate to get in, dying to get out."" I think the latter works much better since the first is kinda misleading.",3,"Hmm... thumbs up, but a very minor one",1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,3309,"['Keira', 'Knightley', 'fans', 'may', 'get', 'kick', 'movie', 'topless', 'split', 'second', 'movie', 'whole', 'may', 'feel', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'moderately', 'pleased', 'Short', 'plot', 'snypnosis', 'four', 'hormone-driven', 'teens', 'ditch', 'scheduled', 'school', 'field', 'trip', 'party', 'out', 'abandoned', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'event', 'terribly', 'awry', 'when', 'are', 'trapped', 'hole', 'gut-wrenchingly', 'disturbing', 'days', 'go', 'by.Of', 'course', 'sex', 'drugs', 'drinking', 'just', 'pure', 'partying', 'what', 'hole', 'once', 'realized', ""'re"", 'locked', 'everyone', 'going', 'insane', 'deaths', 'Only', 'one', 'person', 'managed', 'escape', 'hell-hole', 'girl', 'named', 'Liz', 'Thora', 'Burch', 'think', 'already', 'gave', 'too', 'much', 'away', ""'ll"", 'know', 'right', 'away', 'once', 'see', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'when', 'see', 'walking', 'around', 'obviously', 'tramautized', 'then', 'story', 'results', 'numerous', 'flashbacks', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'lil', 'twisted', 'when', 'person', 'story', 'completely', 'inaccurate', 'false', 'good', 'half', 'movie', 'are', 'falsely', 'informed', 'event', 'Now', 'story', 'rolling', 'pieces', 'flashbacks', 'movie', 'theme', 'obsession', 'one', 'desperate', 'way', 'get', 'what', 'he/she', 'really', 'means', 'necessary', 'Liz', 'get', 'attention', 'boy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'acheive', 'such', 'desire', 'social', 'outcast', 'type', 'weird', 'one', 'kinda', 'other', 'character', 'played', 'American', 'Beauty', 'only', 'more', 'demented', 'mind', 'soul', 'may', 'love', 'hate', 'express', 'feelings', 'simultaneously', 'particularly', 'scene', 'where', 'Liz', 'calmly', 'talking', 'Frankie', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'who', 'just', 'puking', 'guts', 'out', 'bathroom', 'Liz', ""n't"", 'express', 'emotion', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'Frankie', 'Man', 'talk', 'how', 'horrible', 'humans', 'can', 'be', 'movie', 'also', 'Desmond', 'Harrington', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'Mike', 'boy', 'Liz', 'deep', 'crush', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'Geoff', 'Frankie', 'love', 'interest', 'Altogether', 'provide', 'good', 'acting', 'group', 'friends', 'trying', 'desperately', 'survive.You', ""'ll"", 'be', 'shocked', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disgusted', 'most', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'least', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Die', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'also', 'had', 'similar', 'theme', 'guess', 'what', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'think', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'wrong', 'hole', 'why', 'teens', 'were', 'trapped', 'down', 'there', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'cruel', 'leave', 'remained', 'there', 'Love', 'hate', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'disturbed', 'quite', 'while', 'what', 'felt', 'liked', 'same', 'time', 'disliked', 'particularly', 'movie', 'weak', 'plot', 'still', 'amazing', 'good', 'thriller', 'came', 'such', 'topic', 'even', 'went', 'top.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'extra', 'stuff', 'Just', 'ho-hum', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'reason', 'back', 'case', 'Widescreen', '2.35:1', 'when', 'movie', 'actually', 'presented', '1.85:1', 'ratio', 'dunno', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'copy.The', 'tagline', 'US', 'Once', 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'British', 'version', 'Desperate', 'get', 'dying', 'get', 'out', 'think', 'latter', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'kinda', 'misleading']",N/A
