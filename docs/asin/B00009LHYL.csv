754109,A3JVE5QDNSHWCP,B00009LHYL,"Clarissa Stuart ""the pixelator""","[9, 9]","I've been looking for this movie on DVD for literally YEARS, so was ecstatic at finding it available thru my trusted first-choice vendor, Amazon.com.  But when it arrived, I was appalled to find that it is a 'homemade' DVD, recorded from who-knows-what source.  Clear plastic cover with a computer generated UPC code and the title of the movie on it was the ONLY ""cover art"".  Printing on the disc itself is plain-jane black block letters on a white background -- obviously NOT a studio issue.All that was bad enough, and THEN we tried to watch it.The content of the disc was some horrible old British stage play entitled ""A School for Scandal"", and (ignoring the fact that it wasn't even CLOSE to being ""Miss Tatlock's Millions"") the recording quality was absolutely the WORST I've ever seen.  It looked like it had been dubbed from a VHS tape recorded from TV and transferred from tape to tape repeatedly before 'mastering' the DVD.  This is some BAD stuff.To say I am disappointed is a serious understatement.  I'm OUTRAGED that they can't even get the right movie on the DVD!  I just finished printing up the return authorization, and will send this back ASAP.I guess my first clue should have been the absence of an image for this offering where one would expect to see cover art.  NO IMAGE AVAILABLE is quite probably CODE for ""steer clear of this piece of crap"".  Hopefully, I'll know better next time.Amazon, I'm VERY disappointed in you for even pretending to offer this movie.  I'd give it ZERO stars if I could, but that isn't an option.",1,Worst Purchase Ever,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,1548,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'movie', 'DVD', 'literally', 'YEARS', 'so', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'finding', 'available', 'thru', 'trusted', 'first-choice', 'vendor', 'Amazon.com', 'when', 'arrived', 'was', 'appalled', 'find', ""'homemade"", 'DVD', 'recorded', 'who-knows-what', 'source', 'Clear', 'plastic', 'cover', 'computer', 'generated', 'UPC', 'code', 'title', 'movie', 'was', 'ONLY', 'cover', 'art', 'Printing', 'disc', 'plain-jane', 'black', 'block', 'letters', 'white', 'background', 'obviously', 'NOT', 'studio', 'issue.All', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'THEN', 'tried', 'watch', 'it.The', 'content', 'disc', 'was', 'horrible', 'old', 'British', 'stage', 'play', 'entitled', 'School', 'Scandal', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'CLOSE', 'being', 'Miss', 'Tatlock', 'Millions', 'recording', 'quality', 'was', 'absolutely', 'WORST', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'looked', 'had', 'been', 'dubbed', 'VHS', 'tape', 'recorded', 'TV', 'transferred', 'tape', 'tape', 'repeatedly', ""'mastering"", 'DVD', 'BAD', 'stuff.To', 'say', 'am', 'disappointed', 'serious', 'understatement', ""'m"", 'OUTRAGED', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'right', 'movie', 'DVD', 'just', 'finished', 'printing', 'up', 'return', 'authorization', 'will', 'send', 'back', 'ASAP.I', 'guess', 'first', 'clue', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'absence', 'image', 'offering', 'where', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'cover', 'art', 'NO', 'IMAGE', 'AVAILABLE', 'quite', 'probably', 'CODE', 'steer', 'clear', 'piece', 'crap', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'know', 'better', 'next', 'time.Amazon', ""'m"", 'VERY', 'disappointed', 'even', 'pretending', 'offer', 'movie', ""'d"", 'give', 'ZERO', 'could', ""n't"", 'option']",Miss Tatlocks Millions VHS

I contacted the seller before purchasing and was told (practically verbatum) the reply that is listed in the sellers response to the original review. I was guaranteeed a refund if I was not happy. I bought the tape and the quality is TERRIBLE!! I DO LIVE IN AMERICA and that doesn't help. Twice the screen completely blacked out, multiple times the channel it was taped from flashed across the screen, and there is much &quot;snow&quot; in the picture.

I didn't ask for my money back because even though the quality is horrible, we were able to see bits and pieces of our favorite parts.

John Lund's slapstick performance as Skyler Tatlock stood out for me back then.  Now I appreciate the performances of Barry Fitzgerald and Monty Woolley.
