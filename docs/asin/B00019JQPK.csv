Ask Miki Koshikawa, a junior at Toryo High School. When Miki parents announce that they and their friends the Matsuras, a couple they met in Hawaii, have decided to divorce, switch partners, remarry, and live together; it upset Miki. During this, Miki meets the Matsuras' son Yuu. Yuu has a mischievous sense of humor, but has a warm, gentle nature. Miki and Yuu find themselves falling in love with each other, despite being step-siblings. Ginta, one of Miki's classmates, and Arimi, Yuu's ex-girlfriend, become upset about the relationship and pretend to date to make Miki jealous. The pretend dating infuriates Ginta's obnoxious cousin Tsutomu, who adores Arimi and hates Yuu and sees Ginta as a rival for Arimi. Miki's best friend, Meiko, tries her best to support her and give her advice while dodging the attentions of student body president Satoshi and having a secret romance with one of her teachers.

797068,A2V026TK7H80V3,B00019JQPK,Carl Cheng,"[23, 24]","Marmalade Boy is one of those animes that preserve the ideas of simplicity within human relationships without the need for fantasy and magical elements, something that seems almost long forgotten.  While these elements are used to keep the enjoyment of the anime high, Marmalade Boy is one of those shows that does not need any of that to keep the audience glued to the TV.A little bit about the story: Marmalade Boy spans 76 episodes and a short movie that acts as a prologue to the series.  The protagonist of Marmalade Boy is Miki Koishikawa (making this a shoujo anime, an anime for girls - centered on relationships and emotions).  Her thoughts that she had a normal life were now shattered as her parents return home from a vacation with plans to divorce and remarry with a couple, the Matsuuras, they had met.  Miki makes it her goal to prevent this from happening, and all this happens while she has to deal with feelings for boys at school and for the Matsuura's son.  Although Marmalade Boy centers around Miki, there are many other characters that have their own depth, personalities, and stories of love and the drama that comes with it.Tokyo Pop puts out a good release with this.  The video and audio quality is very nice for an older show.  Putting out releases in smaller box sets of 19 episodes each was a good idea.  With this being a much longer series than most, this makes it easier for people to get and enjoy the series without having to wait for individual volumes.Final Note: I am extremely happy that Tokyo Pop has taken the effort to release a series that many feared would never be licensed.  Along with this was Hana Yori Dango (Boys over Flowers) in terms of older, but amazing series with great stories.  With the present anime and looking into the future, it seems we are forgetting the simplicity of stories and of human relationships that can be evocated easily and beautifully without the need to complicate it with other factors.",5,One of the Older Classics,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,1965,"['Marmalade', 'Boy', 'one', 'animes', 'preserve', 'ideas', 'simplicity', 'human', 'relationships', 'need', 'fantasy', 'magical', 'elements', 'something', 'almost', 'long', 'forgotten', 'elements', 'are', 'used', 'keep', 'enjoyment', 'anime', 'high', 'Marmalade', 'Boy', 'one', 'shows', 'not', 'need', 'keep', 'audience', 'glued', 'TV.A', 'little', 'bit', 'story', 'Marmalade', 'Boy', '76', 'episodes', 'short', 'movie', 'prologue', 'series', 'protagonist', 'Marmalade', 'Boy', 'Miki', 'Koishikawa', 'making', 'shoujo', 'anime', 'anime', 'girls', 'centered', 'relationships', 'emotions', 'thoughts', 'had', 'normal', 'life', 'were', 'now', 'shattered', 'parents', 'return', 'home', 'vacation', 'plans', 'divorce', 'remarry', 'couple', 'Matsuuras', 'had', 'met', 'Miki', 'goal', 'prevent', 'happening', 'deal', 'feelings', 'boys', 'school', 'Matsuura', 'son', 'Marmalade', 'Boy', 'centers', 'Miki', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'depth', 'personalities', 'stories', 'love', 'drama', 'it.Tokyo', 'Pop', 'out', 'good', 'release', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'very', 'nice', 'older', 'show', 'Putting', 'out', 'releases', 'smaller', 'box', 'sets', '19', 'episodes', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'being', 'much', 'longer', 'series', 'most', 'easier', 'people', 'get', 'enjoy', 'series', 'having', 'wait', 'individual', 'volumes.Final', 'Note', 'am', 'extremely', 'happy', 'Tokyo', 'Pop', 'taken', 'effort', 'release', 'series', 'many', 'feared', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'licensed', 'was', 'Hana', 'Yori', 'Dango', 'Boys', 'Flowers', 'terms', 'older', 'amazing', 'series', 'great', 'stories', 'present', 'anime', 'looking', 'future', 'are', 'forgetting', 'simplicity', 'stories', 'human', 'relationships', 'can', 'be', 'evocated', 'easily', 'beautifully', 'need', 'complicate', 'other', 'factors']",Marmalade Boy: Ultimate Scrapbook - Volume 1
797069,A1YMS2TL8GHA4R,B00019JQPK,Fisket,"[14, 15]","...That is, if I can. That is, if it's possible.Plotting a diagram of the relationships that are traced and followed throughout this fantastic shoujo soap-style manga is quite a challenge. It's almost laughable, but this story is simply about young people and their daily lives and relationships. No giant mecha, no magical girls, no 'let's save the world before dinner time'. None of the usual anime fare, really. Yet the manga gets the last laugh, because you'll be hooked before you know it.Miki wishes her life were more interesting, and her wish comes true when her parents suddenly announce that they are getting a divorce, and switching partners with another couple for a remarriage.Miki is shocked and upset, but then she meets Yuu, the son of the other couple. Yuu is good looking, polite and fun, and Miki soon starts wondering what her feelings for her new 'brother' are... Meanwhile, Miki's best friend Ginta is trying to find a way to tell her he loves her, Yuu's ex-girlfriend returns with the intention of getting Yuu back, and Miki's friend Meiko has some heavy issues of her own.It sounds like a soap opera, and in a lot of ways it is, but without being repetitive and throwaway viewing- it's far more addictive and well-plotted than that, with lots of twists and turns to the story to keep you interested and enthused.I think a lot of my love for this series comes from its ultimate realism and undeniable cuteness. It's well-nigh impossible not to fall in love with these people- you soon forget that they're characters, and I was sure Wataru Yoshizumi, the creator of the manga of this series, had been to my high school and decided to put everyone I knew into this series. As you watch it, you just can't shake off the feeling that you've met all of these people before. I guess that's just because they're so realistic. The only thing about this series that isn't perfect is the animation, which isn't what you'll expect if you're used to anime like Inu-yasha or Full Metal Panic. However, I think it's still good and really cute.As for the cuteness... *chibi grin* There's a unique delight to be had from watching the destined couples slowly but surely realise their feelings for each other, and finally get together. Don't underestimate this story's ability to have you alternately squealing with delight and clenching your fists with anticipation.Fun, easy, involving, surprisingly touching: a darn good watch. You'll be crying 'kawaii' before you know it. ^_^",5,I'd better draw it out on the blackboard...,1075248000,"01 28, 2004",2004,2485,"['can', 'possible.Plotting', 'diagram', 'relationships', 'are', 'traced', 'followed', 'fantastic', 'shoujo', 'soap-style', 'manga', 'quite', 'challenge', 'almost', 'laughable', 'story', 'simply', 'young', 'people', 'daily', 'lives', 'relationships', 'giant', 'mecha', 'magical', 'girls', ""'let"", 'save', 'world', 'dinner', 'time', 'None', 'usual', 'anime', 'fare', 'really', 'manga', 'last', 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked', 'know', 'it.Miki', 'life', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'wish', 'true', 'when', 'parents', 'suddenly', 'announce', 'are', 'getting', 'divorce', 'switching', 'partners', 'couple', 'remarriage.Miki', 'shocked', 'upset', 'then', 'Yuu', 'son', 'other', 'couple', 'Yuu', 'good', 'looking', 'polite', 'fun', 'Miki', 'soon', 'wondering', 'what', 'feelings', 'new', ""'brother"", 'are', 'Meanwhile', 'Miki', 'best', 'friend', 'Ginta', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'tell', 'Yuu', 'ex-girlfriend', 'returns', 'intention', 'getting', 'Yuu', 'back', 'Miki', 'friend', 'Meiko', 'heavy', 'issues', 'own.It', 'sounds', 'soap', 'opera', 'lot', 'ways', 'being', 'repetitive', 'throwaway', 'viewing-', 'far', 'more', 'addictive', 'well-plotted', 'lots', 'twists', 'story', 'keep', 'interested', 'enthused.I', 'think', 'lot', 'love', 'series', 'ultimate', 'realism', 'undeniable', 'cuteness', 'well-nigh', 'impossible', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'people-', 'soon', 'forget', ""'re"", 'characters', 'was', 'sure', 'Wataru', 'Yoshizumi', 'creator', 'manga', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'decided', 'put', 'everyone', 'knew', 'series', 'watch', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'off', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'met', 'people', 'guess', 'just', ""'re"", 'so', 'realistic', 'only', 'thing', 'series', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'animation', ""n't"", 'what', ""'ll"", 'expect', ""'re"", 'used', 'anime', 'Inu-yasha', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'However', 'think', 'still', 'good', 'really', 'cute.As', 'cuteness', '*chibi', 'grin*', 'unique', 'delight', 'be', 'had', 'watching', 'destined', 'couples', 'slowly', 'surely', 'realise', 'feelings', 'other', 'finally', 'get', 'together', 'Do', ""n't"", 'underestimate', 'story', 'ability', 'have', 'alternately', 'squealing', 'delight', 'clenching', 'fists', 'anticipation.Fun', 'easy', 'involving', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'darn', 'good', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'crying', ""'kawaii"", 'know', '^_^']",Marmalade Boy: Ultimate Scrapbook - Volume 1

Miki is a great girl and so is her best friend Meiko. I wanted them to be happy so bad it drove me crazy when all those other guys tried to sabotage their relationships. I didn't ever understand the appeal of Yuu though. He's supposed to be handsome and relatively athletic, but other than that I think he's kind of uninteresting. I guess its good that I'm not too fond of him. Since I'm a guy and all. But he is good to Miki so I can overlook his lack of appeal. The series is simply fantastic.

797074,A2LNP6JE11OHZR,B00019JQPK,Razor Queen(Witch Hunter),"[2, 34]","Okay here i go, buckle up.I started watching marmalade boy when I was eight years old. I adored it. Completely hooked is an understatement. I taped every episode and even made addicts out of a couple of friends. I got all the manga (yes, it was published and aired in Spain a long time ago) and bought the soundtracks.The reason for all of this?An eight year old doesn't know any better.You want a real review of marmalade boy, here it is:Lets start off with the title shall we? Marmalade boy sounds quite appetizing does it not? Well the feeling ends after the credits have stopped rolling. Exchanging partners is the most normal thing in the world. If they can exchange with another married couple with a cute son included thats a bonus I guess. This anime should have been called `six people get it on'. Your mother gets it on with my farther, my mother gets it on with your farther. And us, since we love each other so much, should get it on as well. That's the animes premise. Well lets start on the characters, miki koishikawa (typical shoujo protagonist) and yuu matsura (another calcium kid). The sun and the moon. She speaks off the top of her head, he doesn't know how to open his mouth. She's kind, him...well, a bit of a pansy. She is quite courageous and tries to get things sorted, and he (a lot of poor me syndrome) prefers to suffer in silence...and kisses miki while she is sleeping (so she doesn't find out he like her, bla!). In a nutshell, they are complete opposites of each other. Come on, with a guy like this your libido goes to hell.The plot?Miki: should I stay with yuu? Or ginta? With keikun?...ohhhh I've got such problems!We also have ginta suou, a hot head who always speaks his mind. And lets not forget the fountain of tears and mikis best friend, meiko akizuki. She's intelligent, comprehensive, is loaded and reminds you of a thoroughbred horse, as miwa satoshi would say. Ahh satoshi, promiscuous...err, no, not in the end. But I haven't finished with meiko yet. Quite a perfect girl...what is she doing having a secret relationship with her teacher? (Not that I find anything wrong with that) She could have the whole football team but no, she prefers a teacher. (There is no reason why a mature and intelligent girl prefers a cultured gentleman then a band of stupid boys whose only interests are video games and sports). This series deals with relationships between a teacher and a student 12 years his junior, guys that don't know if they are gay, incestuous relationships (miki and yuu still decide to be together even after they find out that they are brother and sister), parents the are more immature then there own children...Whose fault is this?Well its wataru yoshizumis', the creator of this pile of crap. But by the way that's not her real name, it's her pen name. Yes the poor girl would be accosted by rabid fans and angry mobs if she gave her real name away. Or perhaps she is just too ashamed to admit that she is the creator of this so-called masterpiece. This woman also has a passion for tennis. The problem is she sucks at it so she decided to become a mangaka(no comment), and so now she always finds ways to insert tennis games into her mangas. At least one of the main characters has to play tennis. This woman has some fierce resentment. She also seems to resent the character of satoshi miwa, who is the only one the end up with no partner. He probably ended up with some guy. We all know that he's a closet gay right? This woman is cruel.So, can we blame wataru yoshizumi for this failure of this anime? Perhaps we should blame the viewers. Those hysterical pre pubescent girls that love yuu (my god they have bad taste).The animation quality?Walking sticks that talk and fall in love. It doesn't give a very good impression to the maturing youth of today, who believe that anorexia is the sign of beauty. To put it bluntly the animation quality is terrible, however it seems to improve in the last season.Marmalade boy isn't a good anime (is it a good anything?). The drama plays out like a bad Latin-American soap opera. This...thing that I am reviewing shouldn't be branded with the title of an excellent shoujo and has no point in its favour.The creator should...dissapear somewhere and do the world a favour of never coming back and creating any more crap.The series is...suitable for little girls, whose brains are full of cherry blossom petals.PS: This is a message to the two ladies above who have both called me an idiot for disliking marmalade boy. To E.Wilson, I will say first of all that I am a girl, secondly I have watched the show in its entirety multiple times and when I did watch it I didn't realise how dumb it was because I was 8 and lastly you sound like you would bash anyone whos opinion differs from your own. To MBstr215, who asks: `why did she watch it when she was eight years old?' The answer is that's how old I was when it came on TV you moron. I recorded it all. I am eighteen now and fancied watching it again for some good old nostalgia. I then realized how childish it was, and wrote this review.  And I never said Miki was a loser; try reading my review properly before you bash you dimwit. E.Wilson is over 16, at least that much I have worked out. For her to get so stroppy over this seems quite immature. You really are in lala land. I will state again that this show is (and is aimed for as stated by its creator) 8 to 12 year old girls. I understand that everyone who reads my review will bash me because most people that come to Amazon to buy it probably have the whole series fan subbed already and are huge fans, so I'm sorry if my review offends you but hey we cant all think alike. The two stars I have given this product are for it lovely music. I still have 7 MB cds that cost a bomb of ebay and I wouldn't lose them for the world. They bring back memories of when I was a child who enjoyed the show and hoped to meet a yuu of her own someday.",2,The stone cold truth,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,5953,"['Okay', 'here', 'i', 'go',

797075,A38JKOT65RLZ9Q,B00019JQPK,Wayne Rossi,"[7, 7]","Marmalade Boy is a synonym for &quot;crack&quot; in shoujo anime.  Tokyopop is releasing this astounding series in 4 sets of 19 episodes each - the only problem being that the other 3 sets aren't out yet!Marmalade Boy, for a show with a silly title, deals with an insanely tangled web of characters and characterization, with an odd sort of love pentagon that forms.  It follows Wataru Yoshizumi's excellent manga fairly well, taking rather obvious liberties as well as its sweet time (76 episodes from only 8 volumes!).  As we follow convoluted affairs of the heart, centering around the unassuming but pretty Miki Koishikawa, whose parents swap with those of Yuu Matsuura.  As something starts to develop between Miki and Yuu, her old crush Ginta Suou comes into the picture - as does Arimi Suzuki, Yuu's ex-girlfriend.  Their rivalries are part of the addictive soap-opera antics, but it's Marmalade Boy's ability to do an early subplot involving Miki's best friend Meiko that really sets this first set above and beyond the average shoujo anime.Marmalade Boy's animation is older and not up to par with many series from the TV boom that really got started in Japan in 1995 (MB started airing in 1994).  However, it generally takes a more mature outlook even when it &quot;goes shoujo&quot; - aside from the occasional pastel recoloring or change from realistic to emotionalistic background, MB isn't so big on the major cliches of its genre.  It's a fairly remarkable series for what it is, and if you're at all a fan of shoujo anime, this is essential at any cost.",5,Very shoujo.
