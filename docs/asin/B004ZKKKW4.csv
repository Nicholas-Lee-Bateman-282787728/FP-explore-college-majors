1434809,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B004ZKKKW4,CriticNic,"[2, 5]","My first exposure to director Shion Sono was with 2001's Suicide Club which I enjoyed very much. Cold Fish follows a similar style as a dark and stylish thriller with over-the-top violence. It follows Syamoto, owner of a small tropical fish shop. His rebellious daughter Mitsuko is caught stealing at a market, who's owner calls in Syamoto and his wife Taeko (Mitsuko's stepmother). In walks in Murata, a quirky, outgoing and seemingly friendly gentleman who happens to also be the owner of a tropical fish shop. Murata's friendly rapport with the shop owner gets Mitsuko off the hook, leaving Syamoto in Murata's debt.After a suggestion by Murata for Mitusko to come live and work with him in his flashy fish shop, Syamoto and his wife feel obliged. However, the closer the family gets to Murata, the more Syamoto feels uncomfortable. As he's pushed to spend more time with Murata, Syamoto see's a different and very dark side to Murata. As it turns out, Murata is a deranged killer and when Syamoto witnesses a killing his life begins to change dramatically.The story is based on the real life Gen Sekine and his ex-wife Kiroko Kazama (though their real businses was dogs rather than fish). Movies based on true events, no matter how loosely based they are, always intrigue me. Cold Fish got my attention from the beginning. Knowing their were some facts behind what I was seeing made it much more interesting. I'm unsure of how much in Cold Fish is accurate to the real life, but one thing for sure about the film is that its full of some fairly disturbing individuals.As Syamoto falls into a dark place, the film starts to make take several turns. The films begins to drag a bit in some areas and the runtime could have been cut down a bit, but the bizarre scenarios keep things interesting. Though I found myself caring less and less about the characters as the movie went on, I was still engaged in what was happening and wanted to know how it was all going to play out.It slowly becomes apparent that most of the characters are borderline clinically insane. When I thought I knew how a character was going to react, or when I thought I knew how something was going to go down, I was often shocked. While at the beginning I found myself rooting for Syamoto, at the end I even found myself surprised with how he evolved. I'm not sure I bought a few aspects of the characters, especially with Syamoto's actions during the finale. Perhaps this was because there wasn't enough exposure to the character development, which the film could have added more of in place of a few of the less significant films that drug the film out.Cold Fish has a lot of the goods you look for in a serial killer movie: abundance of gore, insane characters, and a psychologically driven story. Its downfall for me though was the stretched out duration, the seemingly incredulous actions of characters and a slightly affected finale. Nonetheless, the film is a stylish psychological thriller full of equal amounts of gore and lunatics that makes for an engaging and visually appealing character study.Source: criticnic.com 31-March-2012",3,"Stylish, dark, and wacky",1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,3116,"['first', 'exposure', 'director', 'Shion', 'Sono', 'was', '2001', 'Suicide', 'Club', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'Cold', 'Fish', 'similar', 'style', 'dark', 'stylish', 'thriller', 'over-the-top', 'violence', 'Syamoto', 'owner', 'small', 'tropical', 'fish', 'shop', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'Mitsuko', 'caught', 'stealing', 'market', 'who', 'owner', 'Syamoto', 'wife', 'Taeko', 'Mitsuko', 'stepmother', 'walks', 'Murata', 'quirky', 'outgoing', 'seemingly', 'friendly', 'gentleman', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'owner', 'tropical', 'fish', 'shop', 'Murata', 'friendly', 'rapport', 'shop', 'owner', 'Mitsuko', 'hook', 'leaving', 'Syamoto', 'Murata', 'debt.After', 'suggestion', 'Murata', 'Mitusko', 'come', 'live', 'work', 'flashy', 'fish', 'shop', 'Syamoto', 'wife', 'feel', 'obliged', 'However', 'closer', 'family', 'Murata', 'more', 'Syamoto', 'feels', 'uncomfortable', 'pushed', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'Murata', 'Syamoto', 'see', 'different', 'very', 'dark', 'side', 'Murata', 'out', 'Murata', 'deranged', 'killer', 'when', 'Syamoto', 'killing', 'life', 'change', 'dramatically.The', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'Gen', 'Sekine', 'ex-wife', 'Kiroko', 'Kazama', 'real', 'businses', 'was', 'dogs', 'rather', 'fish', 'Movies', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'matter', 'how', 'loosely', 'based', 'are', 'always', 'intrigue', 'Cold', 'Fish', 'got', 'attention', 'beginning', 'Knowing', 'were', 'facts', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'unsure', 'how', 'much', 'Cold', 'Fish', 'accurate', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'film', 'full', 'fairly', 'disturbing', 'individuals.As', 'Syamoto', 'dark', 'place', 'film', 'make', 'take', 'several', 'turns', 'films', 'drag', 'bit', 'areas', 'runtime', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'bit', 'bizarre', 'scenarios', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'found', 'caring', 'less', 'less', 'characters', 'movie', 'went', 'was', 'still', 'engaged', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'wanted', 'know', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'out.It', 'slowly', 'apparent', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'borderline', 'clinically', 'insane', 'When', 'thought', 'knew', 'how', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'react', 'when', 'thought', 'knew', 'how', 'something', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'was', 'often', 'shocked', 'beginning', 'found', 'rooting', 'Syamoto', 'end', 'even', 'found', 'surprised', 'how', 'evolved', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'bought', 'few', 'aspects', 'characters', 'especially', 'Syamoto', 'actions', 'finale', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'exposure', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'place', 'few', 'less', 'significant', 'films', 'drug', 'film', 'out.Cold', 'Fish', 'lot', 'goods', 'look', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'abundance', 'gore', 'insane', 'characters', 'psychologically', 'driven', 'story', 'downfall', 'was', 'stretched', 'duration', 'seemingly', 'incredulous', 'actions', 'characters', 'slightly', 'affected', 'finale', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'stylish', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'full', 'equal', 'amounts', 'gore', 'lunatics', 'engaging', 'visually', 'appealing', 'character', 'study.Source', 'criticnic.com', '31-March-2012']",Cold Fish

Dark, nasty, and totally insane, this film makes you feel the way Sion wants you to feel. That, right there, is his key power as a film maker. He can make you laugh at inappropriate moments and incapable of laughing even when characters are trying to be humorous (inappropriately humorous, of course). He'll shock you by showing things you probably should have seen coming, and beat that shock into your head like a railroad spike with every new scene of violence and debauchery.I used to try and classify Sion's movies in comparison to each other, with Hair Extensions, Suicide Club and Noriko's Dinner Table in the ""safe for average people"" spectrum with Strange Circus and now Cold Fish on the ""careful who you show this to"" side. But the more I watch his films the more I realize they all must be handled with care. The Sion Sono fan wields great power by being able to show people things about themselves they wished they didn't possess.But with this power comes great responsibility, for his films can and will mess with people. And while Cold Fish is definitely first in line for the category of ""most humorous yet seriously wrong fight scene ever"" (the last one, which you will just have to discover for yourself) it is also toeing the line, along with all other Sion movies, for ""every angle of humanity exposed and you might not like what you see,"" which is a category that should have its own Academy Award.In sum, it's great.

About all I can say in this films favor is there were a few nicely directed and cut scenes, but not as a spine or overall directorial control of the work. Acting was over the top and nothing to rave about. The characters were ultra-annoying. The gore was so bad it almost made one wish guns were allowed in Japan, for some nice clean murders instead of floors and walls and tubs and rooms slathered with blood and chopped up bodies that would fit nicely in Japanese dumplings or rice-balls.

One certainly couldn't call them true to life, even in the magical-realist sense one must use of &#8220;true to life&#8221; when discussing the films of, say, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, but they're not fully into the sort of ridiculous fantasy world one finds with directors like Hiroki Yamaguchi. Sono certainly uses elements of absurdism in his films, but keeps them grounded enough in the real world as to make much of what he splashes across the screen terrifyingly plausible. This may never be truer than in Cold Fish, a movie that is simultaneously so plausible that it could be happening next door to you and so absurd that it couldn't be happening anywhere. I still have no idea how to reconcile those two ideas in my head.Nobuyuki Syamoto (Twilight Samurai's Mitsuru Fukikoshi) has a troublesome, rebellious daughter, Taeko (13 Assassins' Megumi Kagurazaka). Things escalate to the point where she is caught stealing. Syamoto despairs of what to do with here, but seemingly from the blue, local aquarium owner Yukio Murata (Cure's Denden) offers to take the girl in, give her a job, teach her some responsibility and discipline. Nobuyuki and his wife Mitsuko (The Land of Hope's Hikari Kajiwara) fall all over themselves saying yes, but as Taeko's apprenticeship in the shop continues, she begins to realize that Yukio and his creepy wife Aiko (A Snake of June's Asuka Kurosawa) are much, much more than they portray themselves on the outside...I'm not sure how much of the game to give away here; normally that wouldn't be a problem, but the film is based on true events (reported much more widely in the UK than in the US, or so Google would have me believe), so you may already know where the movie's going anyway. Its biggest problem (and one Sono, like Stephen King, seems to suffer from more frequently as he gets older and more popular) is with scope; this is a ninety-minute comedy-thriller that is expanded to two and a half hours for... well, no good reason, really. There's a great deal of filler here that could have been left on the cutting room floor. But those ninety minutes? Those are very good cinema indeed. Worth watching for existing fans of Sono's; those unfortunates who are asyet unfamiliar with his work would do better to seek out some of his earlier works (Suicide Club is quite readily available in the western market) before trying to tackle this one. ** ",3,Stealer's weal.,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,2501,"['Tsumetai', 'Nettaigyo', 'Cold', 'Fish', 'Shion', 'Sono', '2010', 'Shion', 'Sono', 'movies', 'occupy', 'interesting', 'place', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'One', 'certainly', 'could', ""n't"", 'call', 'true', 'life', 'even', 'magical-realist', 'sense', 'one', 'must', 'use', '8220', 'true', 'life', '8221', 'when', 'discussing', 'films', 'say', 'Kiyoshi', 'Kurosawa', ""'re"", 'not', 'fully', 'sort', 'ridiculous', 'fantasy', 'world', 'one', 'directors', 'Hiroki', 'Yamaguchi', 'Sono', 'certainly', 'elements', 'absurdism', 'films', 'grounded', 'enough', 'real', 'world', 'make', 'much', 'what', 'screen', 'terrifyingly', 'plausible', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'truer', 'Cold', 'Fish', 'movie', 'simultaneously', 'so', 'plausible', 'could', 'be', 'happening', 'next', 'door', 'so', 'absurd', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happening', 'anywhere', 'still', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'reconcile', 'two', 'ideas', 'head.Nobuyuki', 'Syamoto', 'Twilight', 'Samurai', 'Mitsuru', 'Fukikoshi', 'troublesome', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'Taeko', '13', 'Assassins', 'Megumi', 'Kagurazaka', 'Things', 'escalate', 'point', 'where', 'caught', 'stealing', 'Syamoto', 'what', 'do', 'here', 'seemingly', 'blue', 'local', 'aquarium', 'owner', 'Yukio', 'Murata', 'Cure', 'Denden', 'take', 'girl', 'give', 'job', 'teach', 'responsibility', 'discipline', 'Nobuyuki', 'wife', 'Mitsuko', 'Land', 'Hope', 'Hikari', 'Kajiwara', 'fall', 'saying', 'yes', 'Taeko', 'apprenticeship', 'shop', 'realize', 'Yukio', 'creepy', 'wife', 'Aiko', 'A', 'Snake', 'June', 'Asuka', 'Kurosawa', 'are', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'portray', 'outside', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'game', 'give', 'away', 'here', 'normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'reported', 'much', 'more', 'widely', 'UK', 'US', 'so', 'Google', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'may', 'already', 'know', 'where', 'movie', 'going', 'anyway', 'biggest', 'problem', 'one', 'Sono', 'Stephen', 'King', 'suffer', 'more', 'frequently', 'older', 'more', 'popular', 'scope', 'ninety-minute', 'comedy-thriller', 'expanded', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'well', 'good', 'reason', 'really', 'great', 'deal', 'filler', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'cinema', 'indeed', 'Worth', 'watching', 'existing', 'fans', 'Sono', 'unfortunates', 'who', 'are', 'asyet', 'unfamiliar', 'work', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'seek', 'out', 'earlier', 'works', 'Suicide', 'Club', 'quite', 'readily', 'available', 'western', 'market', 'trying', 'tackle', 'one', '**']",Cold Fish

(Strange Circus, Suicide Club, and Noriko's Dinner Table.)  I would have to say this ranks up there with some of the best cinema to undergo the ""genre film"" tag released in a long while.  I am happy to be the first to review this film on Amazon as it fully deserves its praise.  Cold Fish is stark in it's portrayal of a man clinging tightly to his moody teen daughter and disassociated wife who's relationship with him seems tumultuous at best.  Until he realizes that the only way to reclaim his family... is to actually let go of his illusion of control over them.  Whether one positions this realization as a transformation into psychosis, or a man taking back his dignity, no one will deny this piece as uncompromisingly obscure and engrossingly empathetic.  The cinematogrophy is excellent, which is very personal in depicting close angles and odd sets to give backstory to its characters.  (The concept of centering the film in fish stores is not only original, can be quite humorous and disturbing, beautiful, and bleak.)  The film is uniquely dramatic, and well scripted.  At parts this film is also brutally violent (which is necessary for gore hounds such as myself.) but poignant and tasteful with high production values.  This is also a slow burn so be patient as the film is sure to pay off for those of whom give it the opportunity.  With this as an addition to the catalog I have witnessed, I will be looking forward to future releases from this neurotic director.  (Fans of this should really look into his other film ""Strange Circus"".)",4,Cold Fish,1323907200,"12 15, 2011",2011,1627,"['have', 'only', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', '3', 'other', 'films', 'director', 'Strange', 'Circus', 'Suicide', 'Club', 'Noriko', 'Dinner', 'Table', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'cinema', 'undergo', 'genre', 'film', 'tag', 'released', 'long', 'while', 'am', 'happy', 'be', 'first', 'review', 'film', 'Amazon', 'fully', 'praise', 'Cold', 'Fish', 'stark', 'portrayal', 'man', 'clinging', 'tightly', 'moody', 'teen', 'daughter', 'disassociated', 'wife', 'who', 'relationship', 'tumultuous', 'best', 'only', 'way', 'reclaim', 'family', 'actually', 'let', 'go', 'illusion', 'control', 'one', 'positions', 'realization', 'transformation', 'psychosis', 'man', 'taking', 'back', 'dignity', 'one', 'will', 'deny', 'piece', 'uncompromisingly', 'obscure', 'engrossingly', 'empathetic', 'cinematogrophy', 'excellent', 'very', 'personal', 'depicting', 'close', 'angles', 'odd', 'sets', 'give', 'backstory', 'characters', 'concept', 'centering', 'film', 'fish', 'stores', 'not', 'only', 'original', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'humorous', 'disturbing', 'beautiful', 'bleak', 'film', 'uniquely', 'dramatic', 'well', 'scripted', 'parts', 'film', 'also', 'brutally', 'violent', 'necessary', 'gore', 'hounds', 'such', 'poignant', 'tasteful', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'also', 'slow', 'burn', 'so', 'be', 'patient', 'film', 'sure', 'pay', 'off', 'whom', 'give', 'opportunity', 'addition', 'catalog', 'have', 'witnessed', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'future', 'releases', 'neurotic', 'director', 'Fans', 'should', 'really', 'look', 'other', 'film', 'Strange', 'Circus']",Cold Fish

1434822,A96JD9312DHWC,B004ZKKKW4,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[4, 5]","Syamoto, reserved owner of the fish shop located just off the highway, finds himself in a quandary. He really does not know what to do with his life. He loves his wife and his daughter but they are like polar opposites. The daughter hates her step-mother because she is not her mother, and the wife finds herself having to do things like hide smoking because marriage changes all. When the daughter is caught shoplifting and the owner of Amazon Fish introduces himself, everything sort of starts sliding and ends up - well, you can kinda of guess, but it always seems worse than you expect.First, the movie is a very graphic tale and has some elements viewers may find disturbing. From dismemberment to forced copulation to the pungent aroma of ideology sliding slowly off the grid, there are ugly things housed in this film. Some of it goes overboard, almost lightening itself, but some of it is visceral and a tad disturbing - as perhaps murder was truly meant to be. Second, the movie is really can be described as a character study in two pieces. One, a horrible man. The other, a man not wanting to be horrible.The pacing of the movie was nice, actually, taking its time with the tale. It did not drag its feet while deepening the hole Syamoto seems to find himself being thrust into, and it did not bore. You got to know the man and his family and the people he suddenly finds himself around, taking in not only the parts that impact him but that impact other portions of his life. At first glance, you get this feeling that Syamoto does not know just how terrible thing can be. A lover of astronomy, he seems the world as a beautiful sphere and not as an ugly pile of rocks at first, but finds the world unfurled in front of him as the action after action is thrust upon him.It is not going to be a movie for everyone and I would not recommend it as such. It is not a Strange Circus extreme but it is neither a suicide Club, landing a bit closer to the former in my opinion. That said, I liked it, thinking it a good 4/5, and would say that someone liking the type of movie would like this as well.",4,Earth as a pile of ugly rocks,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,2105,"['Syamoto', 'reserved', 'owner', 'fish', 'shop', 'located', 'just', 'highway', 'quandary', 'really', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'wife', 'daughter', 'are', 'polar', 'opposites', 'daughter', 'step-mother', 'not', 'mother', 'wife', 'having', 'do', 'things', 'hide', 'smoking', 'marriage', 'changes', 'When', 'daughter', 'caught', 'shoplifting', 'owner', 'Amazon', 'Fish', 'everything', 'sort', 'starts', 'sliding', 'up', 'well', 'can', 'kinda', 'guess', 'always', 'worse', 'expect.First', 'movie', 'very', 'graphic', 'tale', 'elements', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'disturbing', 'dismemberment', 'forced', 'copulation', 'pungent', 'aroma', 'ideology', 'sliding', 'slowly', 'grid', 'are', 'ugly', 'things', 'housed', 'film', 'overboard', 'almost', 'lightening', 'visceral', 'tad', 'disturbing', 'perhaps', 'murder', 'was', 'truly', 'meant', 'be', 'Second', 'movie', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'pieces', 'One', 'horrible', 'man', 'other', 'man', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'horrible.The', 'pacing', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'actually', 'taking', 'time', 'tale', 'did', 'not', 'drag', 'feet', 'deepening', 'hole', 'Syamoto', 'find', 'being', 'thrust', 'did', 'not', 'bore', 'got', 'know', 'man', 'family', 'people', 'suddenly', 'taking', 'not', 'only', 'parts', 'impact', 'impact', 'other', 'portions', 'life', 'first', 'glance', 'get', 'feeling', 'Syamoto', 'not', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'terrible', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'lover', 'astronomy', 'world', 'beautiful', 'sphere', 'not', 'ugly', 'pile', 'rocks', 'first', 'world', 'unfurled', 'front', 'action', 'action', 'thrust', 'him.It', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'everyone', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'such', 'not', 'Strange', 'Circus', 'extreme', 'suicide', 'Club', 'landing', 'bit', 'closer', 'former', 'opinion', 'said', 'liked', 'thinking', 'good', '4/5', 'would', 'say', 'someone', 'liking', 'type', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'as', 'well']",Cold Fish
