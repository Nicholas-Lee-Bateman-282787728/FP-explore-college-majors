1019018,A2OXV459B8FOGP,B000I2KQOU,"proteus ""ps""","[9, 10]","I really loved this show. They don't do television like this anymore. I don't care what anyone say, the 80's was the best decade for quality t.v. Things sorta went down hill after that. Gimme A Break is one of those shows that I loved and always will. I'm so glad they are going back into the archives and bringing back quality t.v shows like this. I plan to collect every season. Unfortunately, the late Nell Carter is no longer with us. If it weren't for her, this show wouldn't be worth seeing. I can still hear her amazing voice singing the theme song, ""Gimme a break I sure deserve it."" Boy those were the days!! Rest in peace Nell, finally you have been given a well deserved break.",5,They don't do TV like this anymore,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,688,"['really', 'loved', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'television', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'say', '80', 'was', 'best', 'decade', 'quality', 't.v', 'Things', 'sorta', 'went', 'down', 'hill', 'Gim', 'Break', 'one', 'shows', 'loved', 'always', 'will', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'are', 'going', 'back', 'archives', 'bringing', 'back', 'quality', 't.v', 'plan', 'collect', 'season', 'Unfortunately', 'late', 'Nell', 'Carter', 'no', 'longer', 'were', ""n't"", 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'worth', 'seeing', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'amazing', 'voice', 'singing', 'theme', 'song', 'Gim', 'break', 'sure', 'deserve', 'Boy', 'were', 'days', 'Rest', 'peace', 'Nell', 'finally', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'well', 'deserved', 'break']",Gimme A Break: Season 2
