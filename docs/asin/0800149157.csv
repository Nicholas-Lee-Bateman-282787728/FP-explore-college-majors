Wymore ""Golden Age of Hollywood fan""","[0, 1]","This is one of Betty Grable's last films and one of the few she made outside of Fox after her long term contract ended. By her own admission, she was a song and dance girl, not a great actress so, as she got older, it was harder and harder for her to find appropriate roles. This role, as a Broadway star, is pretty much stretching the age limit on these things and you can tell that it was getting towards the end of her career as a film star in the capacity of song and dance girl. Marge Champion has more dance time than Betty, something that wouldn't have happened at Fox when Betty was in her heyday. Jack Lemmon is too young for her in his role as one of the husbands; Gower Champion is not at all interesting as the other husband (he dances well but that's about it).

He writes 'em and she plays 'em on the stage, but their team is incomplete. Julie's former husband Marty Stewart (Jack Lemmon) used to co-write the shows, but he was killed during the war, or at least that is what everyone thinks. In reality, Marty was marooned on an island; it was another Martin Stewart that died. Julie and Vernon are in for the shock of their lives when Marty returns and anticipates home sweet home, but finds himself involved in a case of bigamy.This film has some great music, especially the Gershwin and Porter songs. Unfortunately, most of the musical sequences come off as bizarre thanks to the way they suddenly appear as if out of nowhere. For example, it takes some time to adjust to the fact that the film has been transformed into a musical when the three come home after a time of separation. The scene is well done, but it requires a few moments to be able to see so.Grable is beautiful here with her platinum blonde hair and musical talents. It is interesting to watch her perform the songs, especially ""I've Got a Crush on You"" in which she seems to be immitating successor Marilyn Monroe. Lemmon is likable as always, a good guy with a tendency to go over the top- in a good way. He brings some comedy to the show. Champion proves to be a very good dancer but an unimpressive romantic partner. His shortcomings make Marty seem like the better choice in a husband. Champion is joined in the film by his wife Marge, who plays a family friend with a crush on both of Julie's husbands. She is a sweet girl with acting ability but without enough star power to play anything but supporting roles.This story idea has been done both before and since this film. Perhaps the best interpretation is Too Many Husbands starring Jean Arthur, Fred MacMurray, and Melvyn Douglas.",4,A Legal Bigamist,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,1875,"['Julie', 'Betty', 'Grable', 'Vernon', 'Lowndes', 'Gower', 'Champion', 'are', 'great', 'team', 'stage', 'team', 'incomplete', 'Julie', 'former', 'husband', 'Marty', 'Stewart', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'used', 'co-write', 'shows', 'was', 'killed', 'war', 'least', 'what', 'everyone', 'reality', 'Marty', 'was', 'marooned', 'island', 'was', 'Martin', 'Stewart', 'died', 'Julie', 'Vernon', 'are', 'shock', 'lives', 'when', 'Marty', 'returns', 'home', 'sweet', 'home', 'involved', 'case', 'bigamy.This', 'film', 'great', 'music', 'especially', 'Gershwin', 'Porter', 'songs', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'musical', 'sequences', 'come', 'off', 'bizarre', 'thanks', 'way', 'suddenly', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'example', 'time', 'adjust', 'fact', 'film', 'been', 'transformed', 'musical', 'when', 'three', 'come', 'home', 'time', 'separation', 'scene', 'well', 'done', 'few', 'moments', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'so.Grable', 'beautiful', 'here', 'platinum', 'blonde', 'hair', 'musical', 'talents', 'interesting', 'watch', 'perform', 'songs', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Crush', 'be', 'immitating', 'successor', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Lemmon', 'likable', 'always', 'good', 'guy', 'tendency', 'go', 'top-', 'good', 'way', 'comedy', 'show', 'Champion', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'dancer', 'unimpressive', 'romantic', 'partner', 'shortcomings', 'make', 'Marty', 'seem', 'better', 'choice', 'husband', 'Champion', 'joined', 'film', 'wife', 'Marge', 'who', 'family', 'friend', 'crush', 'Julie', 'husbands', 'sweet', 'girl', 'acting', 'ability', 'enough', 'star', 'power', 'play', 'anything', 'supporting', 'roles.This', 'story', 'idea', 'been', 'done', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'interpretation', 'Too', 'Many', 'Husbands', 'starring', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas']",N/A
