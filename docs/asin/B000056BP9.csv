Learning the truth about the things some people do, and possibly because they have the power to do it is very disturbing.  The movie was good because it was based on true accounts of Caligula's reign.",4,"All I can say is, WOW.l",1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,330,"['Anyone', 'liking', 'bizarre', 'situations', 'looking', 'people', 'doing', 'terrible', 'things', 'other', 'people', 'then', 'movie', 'up', 'alley', 'Learning', 'truth', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'possibly', 'have', 'power', 'do', 'very', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'accounts', 'Caligula', 'reign']",N/A
568833,A3QF6PZ50FLTZG,B000056BP9,cirenelle,"[1, 1]","English-language single-dvd period erotic horror-drama from Joe D'Amato is rated NR for lengthy female nudity, but some of its blood and action and all of its pornographic scenes are missing. However this Soft Touch Video dvd print has an authentic look and feel to it and if you are into Roman History it is definitely worth watching and not expensive. One of its stand-out gore scenes was done better in Patrick Still Lives and Mother Of Tears, but generally the acting and direction are laid-back and extremely good. What lets down this 2004 print is the visual quality in its beach and swimmingpool scenes compared to the 2009 Stormovie mainly-Italian R0 2-dvd boxset 18-rated prints. If you are into this film and can afford it get this one so you know what the players are saying, and then get the visually superior 102m and 125m Italian prints(sold together). The hard porno scenes in the longest and partly-English print are well photographed but are so long that they may become boring. This isnt a D'Amato gorefest like Beyond The Darkness, and you might find that the 102m version-censurata is the one you want to watch again although it is all in Italian. All 3 prints mentioned are 16/9 and R0. I again commend Amazon for believing, as I do, that if you are old enough to vote you are old enough to watch what you want to....",4,tries to be a good movie,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,1338,"['English-language', 'single-dvd', 'period', 'erotic', 'horror-drama', 'Joe', ""D'Amato"", 'rated', 'NR', 'lengthy', 'female', 'nudity', 'blood', 'action', 'pornographic', 'scenes', 'are', 'missing', 'However', 'Soft', 'Touch', 'Video', 'dvd', 'print', 'authentic', 'look', 'feel', 'are', 'Roman', 'History', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'expensive', 'One', 'stand-out', 'gore', 'scenes', 'was', 'done', 'better', 'Patrick', 'Still', 'Mother', 'Tears', 'generally', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'laid-back', 'extremely', 'good', 'What', 'down', '2004', 'print', 'visual', 'quality', 'beach', 'swimmingpool', 'scenes', 'compared', '2009', 'Stormovie', 'mainly-Italian', 'R0', '2-dvd', 'boxset', '18-rated', 'prints', 'are', 'film', 'can', 'afford', 'get', 'one', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'players', 'are', 'saying', 'then', 'get', 'visually', 'superior', '102m', '125m', 'Italian', 'prints', 'sold', 'together', 'hard', 'porno', 'scenes', 'longest', 'partly-English', 'print', 'are', 'well', 'photographed', 'are', 'so', 'long', 'may', 'become', 'boring', ""D'Amato"", 'gorefest', 'Beyond', 'Darkness', 'might', 'find', '102m', 'version-censurata', 'one', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'Italian', '3', 'prints', 'mentioned', 'are', '16/9', 'R0', 'again', 'commend', 'Amazon', 'believing', 'do', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'vote', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'watch', 'what', 'want']",N/A

From the uncropped opening credits which over-run the screen, to the terrible quality of this supposedly and advertised &quot;Digitally Mastered&quot; dvd. I've seen 2nd generation bootleg video tapes with better picture and sound quality. Add the fact that it is advertised as being Dolby Digital but in reality is of poor quality MONO, then one starts to realize that truth in advertising is a myth. At least as far as Soft Touch Video is concerned. With the name of Soft Touch, however ironic, a strong &quot;Caveat Emptor&quot; is appropriate. With an &quot;Interactive Menu&quot; being nothing more than &quot;scene access&quot; and &quot;start the movie&quot;, the actual movie...if this is an uncut version, is a farce. This movie in the &quot;unrated&quot; version should be an &quot;R&quot;. There are a few nude scenes but more often than not it merely hints at what is happening or about to happen. Poorly lit, the only good thing about this film is Laura Gemser who looks great despite; how shall we say; creative dubbing. Although it is listed as having a 92 minute run time when in reality it runs 88 minutes from opening credits to the end, we begin to note a pattern of inconsistencies emerging. Which by now is all too familiar. How often have you ever bought any movie which had the REAL run time printed on it? You know? Now that I think about it, I must have gotten the wrong dvd. This can't be the one they advertised. Do yourself a favor and run like hell from this dvd.
