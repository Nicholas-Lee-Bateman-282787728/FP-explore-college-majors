It was Vaudville, Burlesque  and low brow humor combined in an hour of TVThis DVD of six episodes fully takes in what the show had to offer. You could call this DVD A taste of Laugh-In.  It captures  in a nutshell what Laugh-in was.You will note, in the late 80's, NBC (the same network that Laugh-In was on) came up with  Saturday Night Live. It  took up Laugh-In mantle without the joke wall or the quick SOCK IT TO ME!However, This small piece of the show on DVD isnt much, we need more! I rate it low, because it feels so incomplete...and for what it worth, it better to have NOTHING than a small taste of greatnessI would rather have a full season of Laugh-in.

I enjoyed it because it was funny, with catchphrases like &quot;Sock it to me,&quot; &quot;You bet your sweet bippy,&quot; and &quot;Here comes da judge&quot; performed by an ensemble cast of comedians including Goldie Hawn, Lily Tomlin, Ruth Buzzi and Arte Johnson. I haven't seen this show for several years, so I bought this DVD as soon as I saw it. This DVD has two episodes from each of the first three seasons and they're just as funny today as they were when they first came out. They even have the show in which Richard Nixon asked &quot;Sock it to ME?&quot; I'm hoping that Rhino puts every season out on DVD in box sets so that those of us who watched it can enjoy it again and those of us who never saw it can watch it and enjoy it. This DVD set has a delightful bonus - the three discs in the set has interviews with Gary Owens, Ruth Buzzi and Arte Johnson, respectively, where they discuss how they were hired for the show and discuss how they worked on the show. Creator and producer George Schlatter also explains the genesis of the show and says that there might be a Laugh-In 2004 and there is a pictoral recration of the joke wall with pictures of the regulars saying the lines they made famous. It's well worth the price and is a look back at a piece of television and comedic history.

Even today, it's still as hip, fresh and lively as it was when it first hit the airwaves in 1968 (I was born 3 years later.) That's why the DVD sets are so incomplete. All it does is leave you hungry for more. Why aren't they released season by season? That's the common packaging nowadays. I would love to have the entire 1969-70 season, which is my favorite. There are too many good episodes missing, ones that I remember from the Nick at Nite days. For example, what about the one with Carroll 'O Connor from Christmas time 1971, in his only appearance on the show? Or, the 100th episode, which included John Wayne and Tiny Tim, plus the return of Judy Carne, Joanne Worley and Teresa Graves? The episode which featured Three Dog Night singing their big hit ""Joy to the World"" during the cocktail party scene is also another goodie that's missing. Makes me regret not having taped these shows years ago. BTW, if anyone has any ""Laugh-In"" shows on video, please contact me! All we have to talk about is the price...

746408,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00008PHCV,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[34, 34]","The Best of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1968) is very good--but only as far as it goes. This three DVD set wastes space on the discs; we only get a few episodes and even then I strongly suspect that one or two of these episodes were trimmed down a little. The picture quality is excellent, admittedly; and the sound is good. We get three bonus interviews (one on each of the three DVDs) with Gary Owns, Ruth Buzzi and Arte Johnson.The jokes are very funny; Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In took huge risks for its time to make audiences howl with laughter. I remember it was a big deal if we children were allowed to watch it! These episodes give us the famous Lily Tomlin act as Ernestine the telephone operator, the swinger's party were jokes with many innuendos were told ostensibly off the cuff; and the dialogue between Rowan and Martin themselves is very well written and performed.There are several celebrity sightings on these DVDs; I liked Tiny Tim despite the fact that his act was rather bizarre; and the episode on DVD number three includes the full show that guest starred Jack Benny. Jack Benny fits in perfectly on this show; he tells jokes and gets set-up by the regular cast of Laugh-In with hilarious results.The regular cast never fails to pitch out those jokes that even today have some very funny punch lines. Look for Goldie Hawn, Alan Sues, Judy Carne, Jo Anne Worley and Lily Tomlin (among others) to make the shows here on DVD very entertaining and funny.Unfortunately, my main gripe (and it's a big one) is that there's just not enough here. Where are all the other shows from the first two seasons? Why do we get only four or five episodes at the most here? This is very disappointing and I will take off two stars for this flaw to make this a three star review.Overall, Laugh-In was hilarious. This three DVD set proves it. Unfortunately, what we get is so good it can frustrate me--and others--that we didn't get so much more from the first season or two. Hopefully Rhino will eventually see the light and produce a proper retrospective of this fine series complete on DVD. This is even too short to be called a ""best of"" Laugh-In DVD set.

Because while the editing in &quot;Laugh-In&quot; is straight out of the French New Wave, the rythm of the humor is pure Borscht Belt. No joke is too low, no cow is too sacred, and that's why this is a priceless buy for any of you kids out there in TV land. &quot;Laugh-In&quot; was to its tumultuous era what Michael Moore is to ours: a forum that was willing to take aim and name names. It was funny and it was courageous, and it deserves to be celebrated for all the brilliant humor it still possesses.For those who decry the shows &quot;dated&quot; references, let me just say: Listen, punk, go buy yourself a history book. &quot;Laugh-In&quot; is inviting you to reflect upon the most significant era of modern American history (the 60s, which defined the America of today as surely as the Civil War did the America of the 1880s), and if you're too lazy to Google what they mean when they say &quot;Mai Lai&quot; on the show, you shouldn't be writing reviews on Amazon in the first place.So thank you, Mr. Agnew, and we'll see you soon, in beautiful downtown Burbank...",5,Topical Humor?
