Judging by this movie, in which he stars, co writes, co produces and composes it's all too obvious why you haven't heard of him. The 'barber shop' folk song at the beginning will have you ejecting your lunch, you almost wish Jason Voorhees would show up and hack him to pieces. I've seen a lot of lousy movies in my time. This ranks as one of the worst.",1,"TRIPE, PURE AND SIMPLE",1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,434,"['Calling', 'movie', 'terrible', 'understatement', 'Who', 'heck', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'Judging', 'movie', 'co', 'writes', 'co', 'produces', 'too', 'obvious', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', ""'barber"", 'shop', 'folk', 'song', 'beginning', 'will', 'have', 'ejecting', 'lunch', 'almost', 'wish', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'hack', 'pieces', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'lousy', 'movies', 'time', 'one', 'worst']",Die Laughing VHS

238440,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,6300271749,Joe Smart,"[0, 0]","This isn't the lost classic that other Amazon reviewers are claiming but it's a mostly enjoyable, if extremely silly comedy-thriller, a genre that was popular briefly in the late 1970's with movies such as Silver Streak and Foul Play.  The plot involves a cabbie and wannabe rock singer (Robbie Benson) who picks up a college professor who is being pursued by assassins and ends up with a wooden box containing a very smart monkey that a lot of dangerous people want.  Die Laughing only has a handful of real laughs but between the monkey, Robby Benson's budding romance with an adorable tom-boy played by Linda Grovenor and Bud Cort's wonderfully quirky turn as a wealthy nuclear-physics major who really, really wants to be a Bond villain, Die Laughing's cuteness factor is very nearly off the charts.  The film's biggest flaw by far are the songs.  The filmmakers aren't going for intentionally bad songs like Ishtar, and the songs themselves aren't exactly terrible--the Jim Croce style singer-songwriter tunes might have made for acceptable album filler in 1973.  But in 1980 when this movie was released the songs were already hopelessly dated and time hasn't made them any better.  If we're going to sit through so many songs performed by Robby Benson from beginning to end it would have been nice to have stronger ones to listen to.  Die Laughing is one of the movies that helped to kill Robby Benson's film career, which is a shame because he was an underrated actor and this is a generally fun film.",3,Forgotten comedy thriller,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1509,"[""n't"", 'lost', 'classic', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'are', 'claiming', 'mostly', 'enjoyable', 'extremely', 'silly', 'comedy-thriller', 'genre', 'was', 'popular', 'briefly', 'late', '1970', 'movies', 'such', 'Silver', 'Streak', 'Foul', 'Play', 'plot', 'cabbie', 'wannabe', 'rock', 'singer', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'who', 'up', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'being', 'pursued', 'assassins', 'up', 'wooden', 'box', 'containing', 'very', 'smart', 'monkey', 'lot', 'dangerous', 'people', 'want', 'Die', 'Laughing', 'only', 'handful', 'real', 'laughs', 'monkey', 'Robby', 'Benson', 'budding', 'romance', 'adorable', 'tom-boy', 'played', 'Linda', 'Grovenor', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'wonderfully', 'quirky', 'turn', 'wealthy', 'nuclear-physics', 'major', 'who', 'really', 'really', 'be', 'Bond', 'villain', 'Die', 'Laughing', 'cuteness', 'factor', 'very', 'nearly', 'charts', 'film', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'far', 'are', 'songs', 'filmmakers', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'intentionally', 'bad', 'songs', 'Ishtar', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'terrible', 'Jim', 'Croce', 'style', 'singer-songwriter', 'tunes', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'acceptable', 'album', 'filler', '1973', '1980', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'songs', 'were', 'already', 'hopelessly', 'dated', 'time', ""n't"", 'made', 'better', ""'re"", 'going', 'sit', 'so', 'many', 'songs', 'performed', 'Robby', 'Benson', 'beginning', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'stronger', 'ones', 'listen', 'Die', 'Laughing', 'one', 'movies', 'helped', 'kill', 'Robby', 'Benson', 'film', 'career', 'shame', 'was', 'underrated', 'actor', 'generally', 'fun', 'film']",Die Laughing VHS

Not only did he have many films that did well, he moved to voice work. The Beast in Beauty and the Beast. You know, Disney.  First animated film nominated for Best Picture Oscar. Then he moved to directing.  Ever hear of Ellen, Friends, 8 Simple Rules, Dharma and Greg; he directed episodes of all of those and others.He is currently teaching and writing.
