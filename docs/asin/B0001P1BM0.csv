812632,A34PAZQ73SL163,B0001P1BM0,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[3, 8]","Just like another excellent documentary, Capturing the Friedmans, Game Over presents its evidence evenly and thereby creates uncertainty in the mind of the viewer as to what transpired and for whom one should sympathize. Initially, I regarded Gary Kasparov as being, yet another, in a long line of fantastically gifted individuals who happened to be slightly paranoid and lacking in social skills, yet, by the end, he won me over. I sided with him in regards to the unfairness of the bizarre and deceptive acts of IBM. Now that's not to infer in any way that he was a victim. Certainly, Kasparov was paid plenty of money, money that would change the average man's life forever, so we should not feel too sorry for him about being used by Big Technology, but, anyway, he was used by Big Technology-or Big Blue as it were. The result is that we empathize mightily with Kasparov who is a flawed human being facing a monster he cannot see or hear. One moment in the film was truly touching and it occurred when Kasparov strolled into the auditorium following a defeat. The fans responded by showering him with a standing ovation. The look of surprise and gratitude on his face was endearing. The story and plot of Game Over is very interesting and worth recommending on its own, but it is the affectational impact that was most redeeming. Kasparov, in person, is probably a most trying soul with tremendous expectations of others, but--compared to IBM, a corporation that lied to him, refused to give him the dignity of a rematch, and then dismantled Big Blue before anyone could find out the exact way in which the apparatus worked-makes Gary look like a man of the people. The morphing of a one in a million genius into an everyman may be the movie's greatest achievement.",5,Conspiracy Amid the Rooks.,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,1770,"['Just', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Capturing', 'Friedmans', 'Game', 'Over', 'evidence', 'evenly', 'thereby', 'creates', 'uncertainty', 'mind', 'viewer', 'what', 'transpired', 'whom', 'one', 'should', 'sympathize', 'Initially', 'regarded', 'Gary', 'Kasparov', 'being', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'fantastically', 'gifted', 'individuals', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'slightly', 'paranoid', 'lacking', 'social', 'skills', 'yet', 'end', 'won', 'sided', 'regards', 'unfairness', 'bizarre', 'deceptive', 'acts', 'IBM', 'Now', 'not', 'infer', 'way', 'was', 'victim', 'Certainly', 'Kasparov', 'was', 'paid', 'plenty', 'money', 'money', 'would', 'change', 'average', 'man', 'life', 'forever', 'should', 'not', 'feel', 'too', 'sorry', 'being', 'used', 'Big', 'Technology', 'anyway', 'was', 'used', 'Big', 'Technology-or', 'Big', 'Blue', 'were', 'result', 'empathize', 'mightily', 'Kasparov', 'who', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'facing', 'monster', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'hear', 'One', 'moment', 'film', 'was', 'truly', 'touching', 'occurred', 'when', 'Kasparov', 'strolled', 'auditorium', 'following', 'defeat', 'fans', 'responded', 'showering', 'standing', 'ovation', 'look', 'surprise', 'gratitude', 'face', 'was', 'endearing', 'story', 'plot', 'Game', 'Over', 'very', 'interesting', 'worth', 'recommending', 'own', 'affectational', 'impact', 'was', 'most', 'redeeming', 'Kasparov', 'person', 'probably', 'most', 'trying', 'soul', 'tremendous', 'expectations', 'others', 'compared', 'IBM', 'corporation', 'lied', 'refused', 'give', 'dignity', 'rematch', 'then', 'dismantled', 'Big', 'Blue', 'anyone', 'could', 'find', 'out', 'exact', 'way', 'apparatus', 'worked-makes', 'Gary', 'look', 'man', 'people', 'morphing', 'one', 'million', 'genius', 'everyman', 'may', 'be', 'movie', 'greatest', 'achievement']",Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine

I was surely smart enough to not play him at chess.Even if I would have been stupid enough to play chess with Mr. Seirawan, it never would have happened.  When I saw him playing at tournaments in Seattle, I believe that he was most likely already a Master at 17, while I was maybe a 1400 at best, and several years younger.  But he always seemed to be a nice guy to me, at least outside of the chess board.  If I walked by and nodded, he would mostly nod back, when he wasn't looking 10 moves deep to crush his opponent.  Head in hands, by the way. . . .And this was the best part of the film for me, at least from what I remember, having watched this disaster-film-in-the-making about five years ago.  I just watched ""Computer Chess"" which was a far inferior film -- one that I took a beating for when I beat it up with a 2 rating -- and so I decided that I needed to rate this film as well.I won't watch it again, but that's not because of Mr. Seirawan.  I just thought that Garry Kasparov went off the rails here, nearly as much as the far-superior Bobby Fischer did 20 years or more before.  It's just that Mr. Kasparov, if he does have a huge IQ -- like everyone seems to believe -- would realize that chess is ""easy"" for computers.  Sure, the game space of chess, when compared against the number of atoms in the Universe, is probably larger.  However, you, or more importantly the computer, doesn't need to open that entire game space to play; even the great Bobby Fischer couldn't do that.  You just need to prune the tree enough, and compute fast enough, to ""see"" what's logical.  And that's what Deep Blue did in this tournament.  ""He"" just could calculate so fast that Mr. Kasparov had no chance, and ""he"" Deep-Blued Kasparov.A big recommendation for Mr. Seirawan, not only because I'm biased, but because he's added quite a bit to the world of chess since he was that young upstart from Seattle.

812636,A3MCC5MAJYJYMD,B0001P1BM0,Dhaval Vyas,"[4, 4]","Being an admitted chess addict, I was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between Garry Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer.  I was hoping to see an in depth look at the match and a lot of what Kasparov had to say.  Boy was I wrong and misguided by a mile.  This documentary is a lot like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash but no real substance.  After watching it, I am sad to say, I felt like I wasted my time.  One of the most annoying aspects about the documentary is that it does not stay at one place for a decent period of time.  It has the typical MTV type editing, where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds.  It is very sad that filmmaking has been watered down to the attention span of a 10-year old child.I understand it is difficult to make a film about chess, but that does not mean one should make it flashy.  'Game Over' did have a couple of interesting ideas though.  It brought up the idea whether computers can think like human beings or not; whether computers have advanced to a unique new level.  This is what Kasparov thought after the match, but this film does not go deep enough with this idea.  Also, this film tries to bring in a bizzare theory.  It tries to imply the paranoid theory that a human being was making the moves along with the help of the computer.  Kasparov had suspicions about this, but still to this day there is no evidence.  Towards the end of the film, it tries to imply the bizzare idea that maybe Anatoly Karpov might have been the human being who was secretly making the moves with the aid of Deep Blue.  Interesting to think about, but I don't know how plausable or realistic it is.  I still would not recommend this movie though, not even for chess addicts.",2,"A lot of flash, but no real substance.",1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,1799,"['Being', 'admitted', 'chess', 'addict', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'documentary', '1997', 'rematch', 'Garry', 'Kasparov', 'IBM', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'supercomputer', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'depth', 'look', 'match', 'lot', 'what', 'Kasparov', 'had', 'say', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'misguided', 'mile', 'documentary', 'lot', 'many', 'modern', 'documentaries', 'lot', 'flash', 'real', 'substance', 'watching', 'am', 'sad', 'say', 'felt', 'wasted', 'time', 'One', 'most', 'annoying', 'aspects', 'documentary', 'not', 'stay', 'one', 'place', 'decent', 'period', 'time', 'typical', 'MTV', 'type', 'editing', 'where', 'camera', 'different', 'images', 'quick', 'sound', 'people', 'five', 'seconds', 'very', 'sad', 'filmmaking', 'been', 'watered', 'down', 'attention', 'span', '10-year', 'old', 'child.I', 'understand', 'difficult', 'make', 'film', 'chess', 'not', 'mean', 'one', 'should', 'make', 'flashy', ""'Game"", 'did', 'have', 'couple', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'brought', 'up', 'idea', 'computers', 'can', 'think', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'computers', 'have', 'advanced', 'unique', 'new', 'level', 'what', 'Kasparov', 'thought', 'match', 'film', 'not', 'go', 'deep', 'enough', 'idea', 'Also', 'film', 'bring', 'bizzare', 'theory', 'imply', 'paranoid', 'theory', 'human', 'being', 'was', 'making', 'moves', 'help', 'computer', 'Kasparov', 'had', 'suspicions', 'still', 'day', 'evidence', 'end', 'film', 'imply', 'bizzare', 'idea', 'maybe', 'Anatoly', 'Karpov', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'was', 'secretly', 'making', 'moves', 'aid', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Interesting', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'plausable', 'realistic', 'still', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'chess', 'addicts']",Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine

Both sides come off as snide and arrogant, obsessively self-absorbed. Kasparov, whose perspective is the driver for most of the documentary, makes a few sound observations about the shroud of secrecy that surrounded the machine during their fateful second meeting, but ultimately seems most interested in making excuses for his loss. IBM, on the other hand, used the encounter as a highly successful publicity stunt and, having achieved their ultimate goal of a victory against the best in the world, promptly closed up shop without ever offering a rubber match. The filmmakers do a questionable job of remaining unbiased, allowing each party to share their opinions without obstruction, but ultimately spending most of their effort focused on Kasparov's wild conspiracy theories. They also, puzzlingly, give away the ending no less than three times over the course of the picture, effectively killing the drama of the situation.

The greatest player on Earth does not like and does not know how to lose, and his account of the match and its result is quite bitter.

This is thedocumentary about the event and his loss. The sense that I had was that the IBM team developed a computer that was the mind equal of Kasparov in chess - neither better nor worse.  However, the computer does not get emotional so when the machine madea brilliant chess move worthy of a great chess master, Kasparov lost his equilibrium and collapsed before the power of the machine.  The metaphysical quality of the combat was very intriguing.  The quality of the movie was nowhere as good as it could have been...the innuendo that (maybe) IBM cheated wasabsolutely undocumented. However, it was also clear that Kasparov was not given examples of previous chess games Deep Blue had played whereas the computer had the benefit of prior Kasparov strategies. Thus, in a sense, the man had a handicap against the machine.Throughout the movie there are flashbacks to a silent filmcalled THE CHESS PLAYER about an earlier contest between a chess machine and master chess players. The machine was known as the Turk because it was designed to look (in part) like a Turkish aristocrat.

The movie began with a narrator whispering about how IBM's stock rose 15% after the match because Deep Blue won. The whispering was just annoying. The movie had several pointless scenes. It had Kasparov going back to the rooms of his matches with computers and Karpov. Kasparov then described the room.  It really did not help explain anything. Another point, they took you to where Deep Blue was now. Or rather, they took you to where one half of Deep Blue resided. It was two machines. One was at the Smithsonian and the other was at an IBM building. The camera took you to a locked clean room at the IBM building and showed you the locked computer. The operations guy did not have a key for the computer. The camera turned and showed a computer that was turned on. Trust me, I'm in IT. A large unix computer is boring. A turned off computer is even more boring. There are no moving parts. Dead space.The good parts of the movie is that you have interviews with Kasparov and the IBM team. Kasparov is a charming guy. The IBM team are open and friendly. The movie shows both the bad and good sides of Kasparov, who displays dignity and his temper when he is being pushed around by IBM. The Deep Blue team are interesting, but the IBM company does not come off well. They milk the match for all advertising they could get. The movie keeps touting that it was a victory of machine intelligence over Man, but the point I get from it is, several computer geeks and chess grand masters after years of effort can put together a program that can barely beat a world champion, if they take every single psychological and technical advantage they can.

The journalist that said he was manhandled by IBM security and locked in a room and not allowed to leave until they questioned him about some Internet report.  I found that very hard to believe and was wondering why he didnt file kidnapping charges and sue IBM.  Its not everyday that a rich corporation kidnaps people, Im sure he would have got a huge settlement.Kasparov throws temper tantrums and acts like a big baby when he loses.  He accuses people of cheating, when the DVD although very one sided in favor of Kasparov shows no evidence that the Deep Blue Team cheated.  Some computer programs play positional chess, I know that Hiarcs is a famous engine that does.  Did they cheat?  I dont know but I sure wasnt convinced that they did.  With a computer engine that runs 50,000,000 positions a second, should we really be surprised when it makes a good move.I wasnt in to Chess when the match took place in 97.  I remember some things in the news but I couldnt recall who won the series of games.  I was pulling for Kasparov to begin with, but by the end of the documentary I was glad he lost.

But in reality he is a selfish, childish, arrogant, guy who happens to be great at Chess.Why was they trying to act like this Deep Blue match made him lose to Kramnik and Karpov five years later?  Does Kasparov get to blame every mistake he makes on this ancient history matchup with the computer?  If we could all have such a scapegoat.I think this movie is worth watching.  It brings up some interesting questions about man and technology.  Personally I dont think losing to a machine is any disgrace.  Deep Blue was space age.  If they created a robot who could K.O. the Heavyweight Champion of the world or outrun the Olympic sprinters would it really change anything?  I dont think so, championships should always be people against people.

812643,A1FJCJJ6YLIU2K,B0001P1BM0,"M. Derby ""drone45""","[6, 10]","This following review will be a spoiler from start to finish, but I'd like to think I'm bringing in a different and worthwhile perspective.  I'd like to try to refute some common assumptions about this film, assumptions which have turned most of the reviews on this page into a simplistic debate.Did this film go into enough detail about chess to satisfy the truly initiated?  Or was it ""dumbed down"" for an audience primarily consisting of people who don't live and breathe the game?That's a question this film inevitably raises.  But it's too shallow a basis for a review, particularly if it dominates the discussion.[SPOILER alert again.  If you haven't seen this film--and you don't want any details of the film to be revealed--then skip down the page to the next review.  Otherwise, you'll see spoilers all over the place.  In this instance, I'm not overly worried.  After all the media coverage of Kasparov v. Deep Blue, much of what I'm saying is not going to be a surprise even to folks who've never heard of Game Over.]In chess, you win or you lose.  IBM doesn't play that game.What we have here is a documentary which is painfully obvious in its bias: IBM must have cheated.  This conclusion is never stated, but no one viewing the film could fail to get the message.  There must have been some sort of conspiracy: even though the details of the conspiracy are never revealed, and no evidence is presented.Oh, how unfair to impugn the ethics of IBM and the Deep Blue team.The preceding was a synopsis of the majority of amazon.com reviews of Game Over.Let me make a wild guess:  most of these reviewers know a lot more about chess than about cinema.Documentaries have a point-of-view.  (Or, at least, this is true of all of the best documentaries ever made.)Accusing a documentary of being biased is like accusing Garry Kasparov of having a big ego.  No one will disagree with you, but then, it's not a front-page headline either.Don't be misled by the ubiquity of complaints, among the reviews written by chess geeks:  that the film doesn't ever get into the meaty details of what should be the film's subject:  the great game of chess.This is not a film about chess.Suppose it were.  Each and every chess geek alive would have paid to see Game Over in the theater, and a lot of them would have paid to see it ten times.And this film--a low-budget film--wouldn't have made a penny in profit.  Because no one but chess geeks would have been able to understand it.Which is why this film is not about chess; it's about the intrigue behind the scenes of one of the most famous chess matches in history.  That's what makes it a film with the potential to draw an audience.  Few people are fluent in algebraic notation for chess moves.  But the John Henry legend?  Now, that is something we all know.Why is there is no evidence?Because IBM took great care--before, during, and after the match--to veil every aspect of their Deep Blue project with the same level of secrecy applied by the CIA when planning a covert operation.""We can't reveal trade secrets.""  Not the most credible explanation, when you consider:  of all the hardware and software IBM developed in association with Deep Blue, how much of it was later applied to IBM products in the marketplace?None.  After Deep Blue ""won"", everything was dismantled, locked away, shredded or incinerated.Everything was weighted against Kasparov.  In nanoseconds, Deep Blue could examine every move of every game Kasparov ever played.  But Kasparov knew nothing of his opponent.  The Deep Blue he'd once defeated had become a different player:  its hardware more powerful, and its software radically updated.  And because the rules allowed IBM to tweak Deep Blue between games, Kasparov (in effect) faced a new opponent with each successive game.Finally, there's the ultimate human factor.  Tournament chess is exhausting: not only mentally, but also emotionally and physically.Computers never get tired.So why did Kasparov agree to the match?  (If you can call it a ""match"".  No chess tournament between human players lasts only six games.)Hubris, perhaps.  Kasparov has plenty of that.But as director Vikram Jayanti notes in his commentary on the DVD, one thing Kasparov lacks is ""worthy opponents"".  Chess is his life.  Yet, at times, he must feel a kind of boredom.  No one in the world can give him the thrill of a true challenge.  Not even Karpov (not consistently), or Fischer (unless he were younger, and sane).Some say that's why Deep Blue won fair and square.  Because until Kasparov faced the 1997 version of Deep Blue, he'd almost never been seriously worried about losing.  So, when Kasparov lost Game Two, he also lost something he'd never lost before:  his confidence.Then there's the alternate explanation.  That even if Kasparov didn't fully understand chess software, he has a better grasp of the ""style"" of individual players--their strengths and weaknesses, the patterns in their play--than anyone alive.  After Deep Blue in Game Two played so differently than in Game One, Kasparov realized the odds were against him...to a greater degree than could be explained by the rules.There was only one explanation.IBM cheated.In what way?  Game Over, unfortunately, cannot answer this key question.  There is no evidence.Facing growing suspicion, the IBM team promised to begin making available more (and better) logs of Deep Blue's play.But these logs were never forthcoming.  The promises were not kept.The ""un-machinelike"" moves which suddenly appeared in Game Two: where did they come from?  IBM and their defenders say Deep Blue was destined to beat any human opponent.  Computer technology would inevitably advance to the point when ""look ahead"" became fast enough, and there could be enough ""plies"", that a brute-force technique could overwhelm even the most intelligent strategy.The retort of the dissenters:  starting with Game Two, whenever Deep Blue chose a bad move, the grandmasters on the IBM team overruled the computer.  If necessary, they substituted a human decision.  That, anyway, is the most popular theory.Remember, though, that the IBM team could reprogram Deep Blue after every game.  Those members of the team who weren't consultants, who worked directly for IBM:  if the computer lost the match, what about their jobs?They were highly motivated.  Suppose they decided to reprogram not only after games, but also after MOVES?  So much more efficient.  That would be only a slight bending of the rules...wouldn't it?But that's the employees' point-of-view.  What about the corporate view?Kasparov vs. Deep Blue could be an historic marketing success.  Compelling news stories with an angle favorable to IBM:  that creates exposure, attention and credibility in ways that no amount of advertising can achieve.It's often cited that shares of IBM stock rose in value after Deep Blue won.  But what is a corporation's most valuable asset? Any executive today will tell you: brand image.This is the REAL game.A corporation has a ""fiduciary responsibility"" to put the next quarter's bottom-line ahead of all other considerations.IBM was compelled to do everything possible to ensure a win for Deep Blue.  It would be a violation of that responsibility if they didn't exploit every possible angle.  If Deep Blue had lost, how many shareholders lawsuits would IBM have faced?A corporation as powerful as IBM rarely loses civil cases.  But think of all the additional attorneys to hire, and their billable hours...including overtime.(Think, also, of the boardroom discussions which would have ensued:  ""How could we spend $XX million on this project and not have a plan:  to make sure Big Blue couldn't possibly lose?  Anyone who thinks it's more important to 'play fair' had better start updating their resume."")Keeping all this in mind:  imagine the ""suggestions"" to the Deep Blue team from IBM's executives.But...it would be shockingly unethical for IBM to tell their employees to cheat. They would never do that.",4,"SPOILER Alert--press ""Page Down"" if you haven't seen the film",1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,7999,"['following', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'spoiler', 'start', 'finish',

812645,A3PLI8V9LTC6MF,B0001P1BM0,"Mr. Roger H. Geyer ""outcast_searcher""","[0, 0]","As a person deeply interested in computer chess and the implications for proof computers can behave &#34;intelligently&#34; - even if within a very narrow domain -- I very much wanted to enjoy this movie.  Unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, the production was rather poorly done, and the audio and video quality were generally subpar.  Plus the piece was scattered and reeked of bias and paranoia.IBM was far from as open as they should have been, especially with the Deep Blue logs -- but the &#34;all corporations are evil&#34; slant gets old.Sadly, it seems that Kasparov largely defeated himself over his paranoia that IBM was cheating since he couldn't fathom a brilliant strategic &#34;non-computer-like&#34; move in the second game.For those who are uninformed about how computer chess programs really work -- instead of speculating and looking for hobgoblins, reading &#34;Behind Deep Blue&#34; will tell you a lot about how the program and machine were constructed, and what the IBM team (and their consultant, Chess GM Joel Benjamin) really did to improve the program when creating Deep Blue from the results of Deep Thought.  This fine book told me perhaps 100 times about what was really going on with the chess, the software and the hardware, as the movie.Joel's extensive work with playing against Deep Blue for months and telling the programmers why Deep Blue did stupid things strategically, and why, and how it SHOULD be looking at key positions is the most logical answer.  Some of that programming almost certainly paid off.  This is a real accomplishment for Joel Benjamin, the programmers, and the future of artificial intelligence.When I wrote my chess program as my final major college project work in 1981 -- even with a simple, slow program -- I learned a LOT about how counter-intuitive computer chess play can be.  My goal at the time was to make a program that played more like a human than any program of the day -- blunders, surprises, and all.I did this simply by aggressively weighting positional factors vs. piece values -- in situations which seemed highly likely to be &#34;worth it&#34;.  The result was that when play-testing the program, even as the programmer, I was often surprised.  One game the computer sacrificed it's queen -- in 1981.  Yes, not two pawns as people claim was &#34;impossible&#34; in 1997, for Deep Blue.  And later, beyond the brute force horizon of the program, it checkmated me.  I was shocked, yet pleased, as at the time I WAS SURE IT WAS A BUG I would have to fix.Later that semester, I grinned as I watched the program carry out a furious attack and chase my king across the board.  When it had me in a very promising looking attack, I had to sacrifice MY queen to hopefully save myself.  The machine DECLINED to take the queen, and continued to chase my king all the way to safety on the other wing (again, beyond the program's brute force horizon).  So now I was groaning -- the program was so wildly inconsistent -- like a club player in a speed chess match.  Fun to play, fun to watch, but you would NEVER assume a computer was on one side of the games.  So the good news is I succeeded in the human-like play.  The bad news was my approach wouldn't be adding meaningful new theory to how to build a better chess program.Of course, the other piece of good news was I now had plenty of first-hand direct experience in how counter-intuitive the behavior of such complex programs can be.  No hobgoblins here -- just several thousand lines of Fortran 77 code and a lot of simple algorithms to try to deeply analyze a relatively small number of positions (for a computer program).It's too bad many people confidently assert they are experts in things they know little about.  Whether it's computer chess, climate  change, economics, or the nature of reality (i.e. religion) -- people often think they are right and those who disagree must be wrong. Thus the paranoia and the accusations.  IBM being less clandestine in (presumably) protecting their intellectual property after the match by disclosing the logs would have (perhaps) helped.Disclosure: I was a tournament chess player, ranking roughly in the top 10% of US players when I stopped playing tournament chess.

Well, I did.This is a 30 minute documentary crammed in 85 minutes.  It's basic point is that Deep Blue made a strategic move in game two (of six) that Kasparov didn't think was possible for a machine.  This move so distressed him that he resigned from a drawn position.Then over the next four games he drove himself into such a tizzy that he made a simple blunder in Game 6 and lost.  The computer hadn't even started computing when he resigned, it was still simply reading the moves out of a chess opening book.On the other side, the IBM team decided that somehow having an enormous team of people design a computer that can beat a single man in a single six game tournament was the be all and end all of life.  They come across as petty and foolish.  In the end they complain that Kasparov had drained all the fun out of winning.So I guess we all learned a lesson about sportsmanship, eh?This movie's only redeeming feature is that it showed that Deep Blue didn't really beat Kasparov.  He beat himself.  If he hadn't resigned a drawn position in Game 2 the match would have ended in a draw.  In addition if he had kept control of his emotions he probably would have won the whole thing.Of course, the IBM team probably knew this when they refused a rematch and it was another instance where they came off looking like jerks.I could have given this movie two stars if it weren't for the awful direction.  The director cut so sporadically between shots that I was forced to turn my head away to avoid dizziness several times.

It has interviews and contributions from both IBM and Kasparov and looks at each game played and reactions to them. It is very insightful to see how each side felt about the match and although fairly even handed, there is a slight bias against IBM with a strong intimation of suspicious behaviour. The constant use of 'The Turk' chess game by the director casts deep aspersions on IBM's integrity and suggests cheating and human intervention by them. The footage from news reports and the match itself really add to the feel of the film. This also looks briefly at Kasparov's career since the Deep Blue match.

Instead, the film wittily pretends to be a documentary produced by actual film-school sophomores. The premise is quite delicious, but the execution is rather heavy-handed and merciless &#8211; surely no group of people smart enough to talk their way into film school would collectively make ALL of these mistakes?It goes for the jugular during the opening credits. The subtext is a late-night, drunken conversation: &#8220;If we&#8217;re going to make a documentary, then we need voice-overs. But that&#8217;s been done to death. We&#8217;re more original than that, so what if instead we do WHISPER-OVERS!&#8221;The results are indeed hilarious, but was it really necessary to also imply that their technical skills are so limited that the whisper-overs sound like a cat being strangled down the other end of a drain-pipe?(For viewers watching at home: things become just a little more intelligible if you switch audio playback from Dolby Digital to plain old Dolby Pro-Logic.)But that&#8217;s just an early lapse. Once it gets going, it gets subtler and finds surer ground for its slash-and-burn satire. For example, only when the end mercifully arrives do you realize that the supposed subject-matter - chess - IS ALMOST NEVER ADDRESSED and certainly not explained.The director throws them a single fig-leaf of mercy, allowing them to describe in almost adequate detail the match-changing move in game 2 when IBM&#8217;s Deep Blue refuses a sacrifice pawn and instead goes for position.(Back in the real world for a moment: Kasparov indeed went into a tail-spin after that move, and spent the rest of the match obsessing about IBM cheating. He never recovered his balance. IBM, of course, assisted his mind-state in every way they could.)There are a couple of other high points. The &#8220;original music&#8221; is very witty &#8211; I only wish the filmmakers could have had the courage of their convictions and introduced an actual Theremin. Instead, they only imply it.There are constant cutaways to a mock-up of the famous &#8220;Turk&#8221; &#8211; an early chess-playing scam, and even more cutaways to a dreadful silent film depiction of the same. These are properly pretentious and boring, as they&#8217;re supposed to be.But the whole thing falls apart with their choice of actor for Gary Kasparov himself. For one thing, he looks just like him. But he comes across as gracious, self-deprecating, and almost modest. That&#8217;s never Kasparov!The end of the match is done rather well, and is just like the ending of &#8220;Rocky,&#8221; but without the blood: &#8220;There ain&#8217;t gonna be no rematch!&#8221; Being the amateurs that they are, the sophomores completely fail to explain that rather crucial point.I&#8217;d give it more stars, if the result were actually interesting, but that&#8217;s the trouble with spoofs &#8211; if you can&#8217;t admit you&#8217;re spoofing, the whole thing just seems too, too real.",2,Almost Brilliant Spoof,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,3115,"['cin', 'eacute', 'v', 'eacute', 'rit', 'eacute', 'spoof', 'often-misunderstood', 'group', 'humans', 'film-school', 'explicit', 'mention', 'subject-matter', 'Instead', 'film', 'wittily', 'be', 'documentary', 'produced', 'actual', 'film-school', 'sophomores', 'premise', 'quite', 'delicious', 'execution', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'merciless', '8211', 'surely', 'group', 'people', 'smart', 'enough', 'talk', 'way', 'film', 'school', 'would', 'collectively', 'make', 'mistakes', 'jugular', 'opening', 'credits', 'subtext', 'late-night', 'drunken', 'conversation', '8220', '8217', 're', 'going', 'make', 'documentary', 'then', 'need', 'voice-overs', '8217', 'been', 'done', 'death', '8217', 're', 'more', 'original', 'so', 'what', 'instead', 'do', 'WHISPER-OVERS', '8221', 'results', 'are', 'indeed', 'hilarious', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'also', 'imply', 'technical', 'skills', 'are', 'so', 'limited', 'whisper-overs', 'sound', 'cat', 'being', 'strangled', 'down', 'other', 'end', 'drain-pipe', 'viewers', 'watching', 'home', 'things', 'become', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'intelligible', 'switch', 'audio', 'playback', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'plain', 'old', 'Dolby', 'Pro-Logic', '8217', 's', 'just', 'early', 'lapse', 'going', 'subtler', 'surer', 'ground', 'slash-and-burn', 'satire', 'example', 'only', 'when', 'end', 'mercifully', 'do', 'realize', 'supposed', 'subject-matter', 'chess', 'ALMOST', 'NEVER', 'ADDRESSED', 'certainly', 'not', 'explained.The', 'director', 'single', 'fig-leaf', 'mercy', 'allowing', 'describe', 'almost', 'adequate', 'detail', 'match-changing', 'move', 'game', '2', 'when', 'IBM', '8217', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'sacrifice', 'pawn', 'instead', 'position', 'Back', 'real', 'world', 'moment', 'Kasparov', 'indeed', 'went', 'tail-spin', 'move', 'spent', 'rest', 'match', 'obsessing', 'IBM', 'cheating', 'never', 'recovered', 'balance', 'IBM', 'course', 'assisted', 'mind-state', 'way', 'could', 'are', 'couple', 'other', 'high', 'points', '8220', 'original', 'music', '8221', 'very', 'witty', '8211', 'only', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'courage', 'convictions', 'introduced', 'actual', 'Theremin', 'Instead', 'only', 'imply', 'are', 'constant', 'cutaways', 'mock-up', 'famous', '8220', 'Turk', '8221', '8211', 'early', 'chess-playing', 'scam', 'even', 'more', 'cutaways', 'dreadful', 'silent', 'film', 'depiction', 'same', 'are', 'properly', 'pretentious', 'boring', '8217', 're', 'supposed', 'be.But', 'whole', 'thing', 'apart', 'choice', 'actor', 'Gary', 'Kasparov', 'one', 'thing', 'just', 'gracious', 'self-deprecating', 'almost', 'modest', '8217', 'never', 'Kasparov', 'end', 'match', 'done', 'rather', 'well', 'just', 'ending', '8220', 'Rocky', '8221', 'blood', '8220', 'ain', '8217', 'gon', 'be', 'rematch', '8221', 'Being', 'amateurs', 'are', 'sophomores', 'completely', 'fail', 'explain', 'rather', 'crucial', 'point.I', '8217', 'give', 'more', 'stars', 'result', 'were', 'actually', 'interesting', '8217', 'trouble', 'spoofs', '8211', 'can', '8217', '8217', 're', 'spoofing', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'too', 'too', 'real']",Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine
812651,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,B0001P1BM0,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[5, 7]","Did GARRY KASPAROV, the world's greatest chess player, get rooked when he lost a six-game match to IBM's supercomputer, DEEP BLUE, in 1997?  That's the question that this padded, but nonetheless interesting documentary asks you to consider.I wasn't even aware of GAME OVER: KASPAROV AND THE MACHINE until I stumbled over it while Amazon surfing last week.  When I was unable to locate a VHS rental copy, I actually bought my first DVD player (NOT made in China, India, or Indonesia) just so I could view this.If you have little or no interest in chess (the world's greatest game!) then there is no chance you'll find watching the 85 minutes of GAME OVER well spent. On the other hand, if chess fascinates, or even interests you, you'll find the movie flawed but somewhat intriguing.I got into chess as a result of the high profile 1972, Fischer versus Spassky match.  Later in 1972, I joined the chess club at my junior high school and won the club championship in a three-game match.  (But interestingly, the player who most intimidated me was blind.  He was a ""Chess Game Wizard."")  Back then, I wanted to be ranked a Master by the age of 16, but other interests began vying for my time and attention: art, girls, and sports and/or the art of watching girls in shorts play sports!  I never became more than mediocre at best in chess, but I never lost all interest in it either. Nor in watching girls play beach volleyball. : )Of this movie's hour and a half running time, likely 50% of it is unnecessary filler.  We get shots of Kasparov revisiting the locales less than 10 years later; the same footage over and over of an old chess-playing contraption; shots of New York City ad nauseam, etc.  As Christopher Lloyd said repeatedly in the movie, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, ""Cut the B.S.; play the game!""  A little atmosphere is fine, but too much of it slows down an already slow contest.The crux of Kasparov's argument follows:  After beating DEEP BLUE handily in Game One, in which the computer played a very mathematical, machine-like style, it made a ""creative judgment"" in Game Two which the man, Kasparov, was certain could only be made by a ""man.""  Subsequently, he became so unnerved - convinced that a human mind was responsible for that move (i.e., he was playing against not just a machine, but also one or more unseen Grand Masters) - that he prematurely conceded Game Two, which possibly cost him a draw and ultimately the match.If chess was purely mathematical, I - the most mathematically-challenged person on the planet - would have never won a game.  There are rich, creative and psychological elements to chess - it is NOT strictly mechanical, not just ""black and white"", despite the colors of the pieces.  It is closer to music than it is to algebra. I have no math skills whatsoever, but I'm extremely analytical and I discern patterns in things.  And I can be quite a fearsome psych warrior!  As a novice playing against novices, I frequently swapped queens when the only advantage to me was psychological: beginners - and even some half decent players - mentally surrender once they've lost their queen.  But I KNEW I could win without her, and it only made me bear down and concentrate more.  I've always been at my best under pressure.  But does a computer ""got game"" when it comes to those additional chess factors?When in Game Two, KASPAROV offered up a pawn (or two?) in order to gain a positional advantage in another sector of the board, and DEEP BLUE declined to take the piece, Kasparov became suspicious and lost his composure.  It was as if a dog passed up ground beef because it ""speculated"" that there might be filet mignon three blocks away.  Is a dog (or computer) capable of that kind of ""thought""?  Or will it immediately take the first gift offered?  How can it sniff out a stratagem from a mistake?  Well, Deep Blue saying, ""Thanks, but no thanks"" made Kasparov deeply blue.  The rest is history.I really wish that the filmmaker had dispensed with 15 minutes of superfluous ""atmosphere"" shots and spent it really analyzing that key move in Game Two. (One of the DVD's Special Features replays all of the games with very basic commentary on each move, but no mention is made of the questionable moment in Game Two or of the importance it held.)  What was Kasparov really attempting to accomplish by sacrificing a pawn or two?  How obvious was the advantage in position that he would have gained?  How much ""creative thinking"" did Deep Blue have to perform in order to ""see through the ground beef""?  How did the computer go from mechanical playing to ""humanistic"" playing overnight?  Was IBM playing chess games with Kasparov, or playing mind games with him?
