The direction is aptly handled and does a fine job of illustrating the helplessness of Gail's family in dealing with a situation that no family can ever really prepare for. The phone calls and letters are menacing, but they set a tone in the first half of the film that is not consistent with the last half. From the title to the big revelation of who Gail's stalker is, the film seems to be cashing in on the early 80's horror craze (in a When a Stranger Calls kind of way). Then, the unthinkable happens and the movie transforms itself into thoughtful family drama. It really is like two movies in one, and I'm not quite sure if that's to its credit or detriment, because it plays both genres extremely well, but never commits to one or the other. The only thing that did elicit an unintended chuckle from me was the abrupt after-school-special ending. Had that been handled a little better, I'd say Are You in the House Alone? is a 4-star pseudo-horror classic. As is, it's just a really solid made-for-TV chiller worth your time.",3,Probably more like a 3.5,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1129,"['was', 'really', 'surprised', 'liked', 'movie', 'Kathleen', 'Beller', 'was', 'such', 'sympathetic', 'heroine', 'direction', 'aptly', 'handled', 'fine', 'job', 'illustrating', 'helplessness', 'Gail', 'family', 'dealing', 'situation', 'family', 'can', 'ever', 'really', 'prepare', 'phone', 'calls', 'letters', 'are', 'menacing', 'set', 'tone', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'not', 'consistent', 'last', 'half', 'title', 'big', 'revelation', 'who', 'Gail', 'stalker', 'film', 'be', 'cashing', 'early', '80', 'horror', 'craze', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'kind', 'way', 'Then', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'movie', 'thoughtful', 'family', 'drama', 'really', 'two', 'movies', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'credit', 'detriment', 'genres', 'extremely', 'well', 'never', 'commits', 'one', 'other', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'elicit', 'unintended', 'chuckle', 'was', 'abrupt', 'after-school-special', 'ending', 'Had', 'been', 'handled', 'little', 'better', ""'d"", 'say', 'Are', 'House', 'Alone', '4-star', 'pseudo-horror', 'classic', 'just', 'really', 'solid', 'made-for-TV', 'chiller', 'time']",N/A

I think it was a tv movie.  Don't expect a silver screen quality horror movie.  But Kathleen Beller as the pretty, terrified girl stalked by someone who leaves her threatening notes in her locker is believable and entertaining.  Sadly, although she is surrounded by friends, family and school officials, she is totally alone in her fear and quite unprepared to deal with it.  You want to shake her and tell her to smart up, but I suspect that her way of dealing with it is probably closer to the way most teens her age would deal with it.  I watch this movie at least once a year and always like it, although I couldn't tell you why.  Possibly because it is real enough to be truly frightening, yet has no slashing/chainsaw murders/etc.",5,"a little mystery, a little scary",1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,870,"['love', 'movie', 'taped', 'years', 'ago', 'wore', 'out', 'finally', 'found', 'pre-recorded', 'bought', 'light', 'entertainment', 'think', 'was', 'tv', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'silver', 'screen', 'quality', 'horror', 'movie', 'Kathleen', 'Beller', 'pretty', 'terrified', 'girl', 'stalked', 'someone', 'who', 'threatening', 'notes', 'locker', 'believable', 'entertaining', 'Sadly', 'surrounded', 'friends', 'family', 'school', 'officials', 'totally', 'alone', 'fear', 'quite', 'unprepared', 'deal', 'want', 'shake', 'tell', 'smart', 'up', 'suspect', 'way', 'dealing', 'probably', 'closer', 'way', 'most', 'age', 'would', 'deal', 'watch', 'movie', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'always', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why', 'Possibly', 'real', 'enough', 'be', 'truly', 'frightening', 'yet', 'slashing/chainsaw', 'murders/etc']",N/A
