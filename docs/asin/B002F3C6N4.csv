1265919,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B002F3C6N4,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[15, 15]","French director Jacques Demy made his mark with the critically acclaimed ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" (1964), which was nominated for three Oscars in 1966. He apparently had fond memories of California, as evidenced in ""Model Shop,"" a delightful and honest film that not only tells a story, but also gives us a fascinating glance at the Los Angeles from the late sixties.George Matthews (Gary Lockwood) is an unemployed young man that lives with beautiful Gloria (Alexandra Hay), who apparently cares about him. George is not a happy fellow. As Gloria rightfully tells him, he refuses to commit to anybody or anything. Unbeknown to him, his life will take a dramatic turn when he is informed that his beloved car will be taken away if he doesn't make a one-hundred dollars payment. Having no job, he is forced to hit the streets in search of money, and, while doing so, he meets Lola (Anouk Aim&eacute;e), an attractive French model, which whom he is quickly infatuated. At the same time, he receives his draft notice, which would mean that he will have to go to Vietnam. All these situations complicate George's already confused existence, and he will have to make some serious choices.Even though ""Model Shop's"" story seems light at times, Demy fills it with unforgettable shots of the Los Angeles of those years. George spends a lot of time driving through its streets, and for us, who live in this fascinating city, is a trip to see how it has changed with time. In addition, you just can't take your eyes away from Anouk Aim&eacute;e, an actress that certainly exuded beauty and sensuality. I think that it is also remarkable that Demy addressed, in such a smart way, the controversial draft, which terrified so many young people at the time. All these elements stay with you for a while.

It was directed by a French director and subsequently has the feel of a European character study rather than a typical American &#34;shoot 'em up&#34;. Which is what it is, a study of disaffected youth of the late sixties.Since it had a limited release and was rarely shown over the last forty years, this print is in perfect shape. It's nice to see the band Spirit while they were on their way up, and the views of Los Angeles are amazing. Both in how much has changed, but also how much of it stayed intact. Pete the Plumber is still located at the same address on Santa Monica Blvd!Even though IMDB claims that parts of it were shot in Dockweiler Beach, they were actually shot in Venice Beach, as you can clearly see the street names during the opening shot. Some of the houses in the opening shot and the &#34;towtruck scene&#34; are still there!

1265921,A36A8KK9ZQBUV4,B002F3C6N4,Kardius,"[2, 8]","First, the marketing of this DVD as a ""Martini movie"" is misleading.  Second, as a huge fan of Jacques Demy's early films, including the great Lola, of which Model Shop (terrible title) is a sequel of sorts, I was really looking forward to this DVD release.  However, it was painful and boring to watch this film.The basic problem, I think, is that it tries to be two things at once and fails at both: a portrait of late 1960s L.A. (with references to Vietnam, marihuana, hipster culture) and a Demy-style (and very ""French"") love story (a melancholy young guy with artistic aspirations meets a beautiful stranger, stalks her, and they fall in love). I think Demy failed to capture whatever ""poetry"" he saw in LA (the two leads point out that they see beauty in a city that everyone else regards as ugly) and I really didn't care about the love story (after having connected emotionally with the ones in Demy's previous films).The other major problem is the casting of the male lead.  Gary Lockwood, as the unemployed George, is really awful (he looks good in tight pants and with his shirt off, though). In fairness, the character itself is implausible, coming off as a dumb jerk (I didn't believe that he hung out with late 60s L.A. hipsters), and I doubt that even the original choice (Harrison Ford) would have pulled it off.  Alexandra Hay, as his girlfriend, is even worse (I wouldn't be surprised if people laughed at their ""emotional"" scenes together).  Anouk Aimee as Lola is still beautiful, but not as charming as in the original. She looks jaded, like she belongs in another, much better film, and it takes a lot of ""suspension of disbelief"" to buy that Lola would fall in love with or even feel sorry for George (the male lead), who first stalks her and then keeps insulting her.In short, I suggest you skip this film and stick to the original, which showcases both Jacques Demy and Anouk Aimee at their best.  Lola is one of the most charming French films of the 1960s.  Towards the end of Model Shop, Lola (the character) fondly looks at pictures from the original film and lovingly remembers.

1265923,AEIZTTNHRON6B,B002F3C6N4,"Neil Elliot ""DEMYgogue""","[13, 13]","Jacques Demy's hope, when he first made LOLA, the character (and same actress Anouk Aimee) who reappears in MODEL SHOP, was to create his own Comedie Humaine....beginning with characters from LOLA reappearing in BAY OF ANGELS, and then on to UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG where one reappearing actor sings about another character he was in love with in LOLA.  It would have continued into YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHFORT but Nino Castelnuovo was not available and so it was rewritten and moved out of line as Part IV.  In 1968 Demy closed the circle with MODEL SHOP.  Initially Demy wanted a new young actor, Harrison Ford, to play the lead, but Columbia felt a name would be better for the lead and Gary Lockwood had just done 2001.  The music, done by SPIRIT, was Demy's second choice, as he had become friendly with a new rock group from UCLA, THE DOORS, but by the time the film was ready THE DOORS were world famous and time limited.  However, SPIRIT created a score that compliments Demy's impressionistic view of Venice CA, W. Hollywood and Beverly Hills in the late 60's.  Not as visually intense as UMBRELLAS, but as psychologically insiteful as LOLA and BAY OF ANGELS, MODEL SHOP offers the viewer  a moment in time, caught in amber.  For trivia enthusiasts, the actor playing Alexandra Hays' boyfriend, the actor/model Tom Fielding, left acting and became a film writer/director....PSYCHO II, CLOAK AND DAGGER, FRIGHT NIGHT, CHILD'S PLAY and a handfull of TV films of Stephen King novels.The film is an interesting look at a very American time and place as seen by a French Americaphile film maker.",5,The Human Comedy continues,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,1594,"['Jacques', 'Demy', 'hope', 'when', 'first', 'made', 'LOLA', 'character', 'same', 'actress', 'Anouk', 'Aimee', 'who', 'MODEL', 'SHOP', 'was', 'create', 'own', 'Comedie', 'Humaine', '.beginning', 'characters', 'LOLA', 'reappearing', 'BAY', 'OF', 'ANGELS', 'then', 'UMBRELLAS', 'OF', 'CHERBOURG', 'where', 'one', 'reappearing', 'actor', 'sings', 'character', 'was', 'love', 'LOLA', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'YOUNG', 'GIRLS', 'OF', 'ROCHFORT', 'Nino', 'Castelnuovo', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'was', 'rewritten', 'moved', 'line', 'Part', 'IV', '1968', 'Demy', 'closed', 'circle', 'MODEL', 'SHOP', 'Initially', 'Demy', 'wanted', 'new', 'young', 'actor', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'play', 'lead', 'Columbia', 'felt', 'name', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'lead', 'Gary', 'Lockwood', 'had', 'just', 'done', '2001', 'music', 'done', 'SPIRIT', 'was', 'Demy', 'second', 'choice', 'had', 'become', 'friendly', 'new', 'rock', 'group', 'UCLA', 'THE', 'DOORS', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'ready', 'THE', 'DOORS', 'were', 'world', 'famous', 'time', 'limited', 'However', 'SPIRIT', 'created', 'score', 'Demy', 'impressionistic', 'view', 'Venice', 'CA', 'W.', 'Hollywood', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'late', '60', 'Not', 'visually', 'intense', 'UMBRELLAS', 'psychologically', 'insiteful', 'LOLA', 'BAY', 'OF', 'ANGELS', 'MODEL', 'SHOP', 'viewer', 'moment', 'time', 'caught', 'amber', 'trivia', 'enthusiasts', 'actor', 'playing', 'Alexandra', 'Hays', 'boyfriend', 'actor/model', 'Tom', 'Fielding', 'left', 'acting', 'became', 'film', 'writer/director', '.PSYCHO', 'II', 'CLOAK', 'AND', 'DAGGER', 'FRIGHT', 'NIGHT', 'CHILD', 'PLAY', 'handfull', 'TV', 'films', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels.The', 'film', 'interesting', 'look', 'very', 'American', 'time', 'place', 'seen', 'French', 'Americaphile', 'film', 'maker']",Model Shop
1265924,ALFUNAATKX84Q,B002F3C6N4,"Premingerian ""Premingerian""","[5, 9]","I note the three laudatory reviews here and the general tone of those on imdb is similar. I'm sorry, but don't make me laugh! This is a stinker from the word go, that is unless you want to overlook the two most basic elements of film story-telling, to wit: (1) a coherent and preferably imaginatively dialogued script and (2) competent acting. As a follow-up to the brilliant ""Lola"" and the virtually undisputed masterpiece ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" -- in the sense that all three films have characters in common -- this is shocking. I think perhaps it will suffice to say that Jacques Demy (who is not only director but co-writer) was not exactly comfortable with the English language at the time he made this, his only American film. The same can obviously said of Anouk Aimee, giving a perfectly ludicrous performance (the ""model shop"" scene, especially, where she gets into supposedly alluring poses for her client's camera must be seen to be believed). Alexandra Hay, however, has no such excuse. She is simply dreadful. As George Cukor unflinchingly said of co-star Aimee, ""The lady simply can't act."" But I have given this film two stars, and there are two reasons. One: co-star Gary Lockwood (really the top star, though second billed; there is not a frame of the film in which he does not appear), though not a very skilled actor, tries his best, and watching his stuff flop around in his tight jeans (no underwear, as is made clear when he puts his pants on in the first scene) is at least something to concentrate on. He also has a very, very cute butt and looks damn good with his shirt off as well (two scenes). If that is enough for you, then you may enjoy this film. The other reason is that an excellent late 60's rock band, Spirit, not only wrote the soundtrack (supplemented by a number of Classical selections), but appear in the film in one brief scene. They can't act, either, but it's a nice documentary moment, catching them just as they were making their mark. It's rather endearing.

1265927,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B002F3C6N4,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","The reviews here are wildly split, with some loving & some loathing this remarkable little film. I largely agree with those praising it, as it does delve beautifully & even compassionately into the emptiness of contemporary culture -- in particular the existential dread of the young American male facing not only the draft & Vietnam, but a world that seems vacuous, tawdry, devoid of any real meaning & depth. George (a very good Gary Lockwood) embodies this figure superbly, forever driving nowhere through a glittering but tacky world, Sisyphus in a sports car.Still, the French art film & the American zeitgeist are sometimes an uncertain fit. Anouk Aimee is mysterious & compelling, of course -- how could she be otherwise? -- but the gap between her worldview & George's is immense, even though he seems to think he can bridge it. Granted, that's partly the point. But I often got the sense of two incompatible films overlapping but never quite splicing together properly.Even so, the film's virtues finally outweigh those caveats. It was bold of Jacques Demy to attempt such a film in the first place, and he succeeds more often than he falters, as far as I can see. The photography truly captures the endless but empty light that lays bare the shallowness of the city & its inhabitants. The acting is uniformly strong, all the more affecting for being so understated.
