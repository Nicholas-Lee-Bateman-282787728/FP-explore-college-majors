I did think it was funny when Delancey went into the dressing room to try on outftis, and she pretended someone was in there and they were fired, that was kinda funny. Well, thanks to teh last reveiw, I'm not a fan of My Scene dolls, but I guess some of them look good, like the Bling Bling Nolee, I have to say, was the best My Scene dollsI've seen. So, I'm glad we worked it out. But I'm not really planning on getting a My Scene doll or their movie though, looking at them and watching the movies on Nick is fine for me.

896411,AG8E2F0G98ZTB,B0007Z9R2U,Fritosgirl,"[0, 0]","I found My Scene Goes Hollywood really enjoyable.  It had a good storyline that held within it some messages girls should listen to.  Is this movie directed towards the really young?  Prbly not.  Is it directed towards tweens (and adults or collectors) alike-- yup.The Story follows the group of friends as they find themselves on a movie set as extras for a movie starring Lindsey Lohan.  Through nothing but luck, Madison gets chosen to be more of a principle player and that is where the story takes off.My favorite parts?  Delancy and the Kraft Service Table.  She is hilarious.  The animation for these movies is something that I have always enjoyed.  It's not a rip off of 'anime' style animation, nor is it truly traditional.  It's very 'my scene', which is fine by me!Overall, don't dismiss this automatically.  The movie is really quite endearing and enjoyable.",5,Really Good Barbie Movie!,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,870,"['found', 'My', 'Scene', 'Goes', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'had', 'good', 'storyline', 'held', 'messages', 'girls', 'should', 'listen', 'Is', 'movie', 'directed', 'really', 'young', 'Prbly', 'not', 'directed', 'towards', 'tweens', 'adults', 'collectors', 'alike', 'yup.The', 'Story', 'group', 'friends', 'find', 'movie', 'set', 'extras', 'movie', 'starring', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'nothing', 'luck', 'Madison', 'chosen', 'be', 'more', 'principle', 'player', 'where', 'story', 'off.My', 'favorite', 'parts', 'Delancy', 'Kraft', 'Service', 'Table', 'hilarious', 'animation', 'movies', 'something', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'rip', ""'anime"", 'style', 'animation', 'truly', 'traditional', 'very', ""'my"", 'scene', 'fine', 'Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'automatically', 'movie', 'really', 'quite', 'endearing', 'enjoyable']",My Scene Goes Hollywood
