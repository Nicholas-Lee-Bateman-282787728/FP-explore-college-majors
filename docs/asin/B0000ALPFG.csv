My initial obsession with the movie came because it's based in Alaska and I was born in Alaska.  This is more of feel good Christmas movie, going through the troubles of family (disobedient children, broken relationships) and in the end it ends with happiness.  If you like Alaska, Christmas, or movies with truck drivers, I'd recommend giving this a shot.  It's definitely an 80s movie, with ""Santa Claus: The Movie"" type acting and filming.
