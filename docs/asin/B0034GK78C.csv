We look for movies that the little people in our family can enjoy as well as the big people.  When I revieiwed Old Dogs, I had concept in mind as the jacket clearly states - ""Fun for the Whole Family.""Synopsis:  Dan (Robin Williams) and his best friend and business partner Charlie (John Travolta) are on the verge of the biggest deal in the history of their sports marketing firm when their lives are turned upside down by a surprise visit from Dan's ex-wife Vicki (Kelly Preston). Vicki has big news for Dan--their ever-so-brief liaison produced twins Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta), now seven-years-old and in need of a dad to keep an eye on them for two weeks. With only high-living playboy Charlie for support, Dan's bumbling attempts at ""on the job training"" in fatherhood result in a series of disastrously funny exploits that lead him to a new understanding of what really matters in life. Featuring an extraordinary cast of comedy purebreds including Seth Green, Matt Dillon and Lori Loughlin, Old Dogs will have audiences rolling over and begging for more.My Opinion:  This movie was hilarious and almost too much at times. This would not have been my favorite kind of movie as the comedy bordered on just plain dumb at times.  However, the last time I said that about a movie, my brother thought it was great.  My husband who also viewed it with me found that the majority of the humor was over the top but towards the end, he was glued and dying of laughter.  The movie has a sweet story of a father getting to know his children for the first time and the sacrifices he must make to get to know them.There were times when the humor was not appropriate for young children and they might question what the actors were talking about.  Overall my husband and I would give this movie a B rating.  He would probably watch again but I don't know as I would have my two year old watch it.",3,Funny At Times,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,2000,"['am', 'always', 'lookout', 'movie', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'look', 'movies', 'little', 'people', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'people', 'When', 'revieiwed', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'had', 'concept', 'mind', 'jacket', 'clearly', 'Fun', 'Whole', 'Family', 'Synopsis', 'Dan', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'best', 'friend', 'business', 'partner', 'Charlie', 'John', 'Travolta', 'are', 'verge', 'biggest', 'deal', 'history', 'sports', 'marketing', 'firm', 'when', 'lives', 'are', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'surprise', 'visit', 'Dan', 'ex-wife', 'Vicki', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Vicki', 'big', 'news', 'Dan', 'ever-so-brief', 'liaison', 'produced', 'twins', 'Zach', 'Conner', 'Rayburn', 'Emily', 'Ella', 'Bleu', 'Travolta', 'now', 'seven-years-old', 'need', 'dad', 'keep', 'eye', 'two', 'weeks', 'only', 'high-living', 'playboy', 'Charlie', 'support', 'Dan', 'bumbling', 'attempts', 'job', 'training', 'fatherhood', 'result', 'series', 'disastrously', 'funny', 'exploits', 'lead', 'new', 'understanding', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'life', 'Featuring', 'extraordinary', 'cast', 'comedy', 'purebreds', 'including', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Lori', 'Loughlin', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'will', 'have', 'audiences', 'rolling', 'begging', 'more.My', 'Opinion', 'movie', 'was', 'hilarious', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'favorite', 'kind', 'movie', 'comedy', 'bordered', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', 'times', 'However', 'last', 'time', 'said', 'movie', 'brother', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'husband', 'who', 'also', 'viewed', 'found', 'majority', 'humor', 'was', 'top', 'end', 'was', 'glued', 'dying', 'laughter', 'movie', 'sweet', 'story', 'father', 'getting', 'know', 'children', 'first', 'time', 'sacrifices', 'must', 'make', 'get', 'know', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'humor', 'was', 'not', 'appropriate', 'young', 'children', 'might', 'question', 'what', 'actors', 'were', 'talking', 'about', 'Overall', 'husband', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'B', 'rating', 'would', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'have', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'watch']",N/A

1325552,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0034GK78C,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","I didn't expect a lot out of `Old Dogs'.  I'm glad for that.  If I had expected anything out of this film I may have been really mad that I sat down to watch it.  In fact, I expected a few laughs and a decent time waster.  I did get a few laughs (that whole zoo scene) and so for that I am thankful.I wouldn't even attempt to label this as `decent'.`Old Dogs' goes far beyond the whole `nothing new' equation.  Sure, there is nothing in `Old Dogs' that hasn't been done a million times before.  `Old Dogs' also goes far beyond that whole `it's been done better' argument.  The fact remains that `Old Dogs' is so awful I really have no other words to describe it.Just plain awful.Why?Let's start with the plot.  I don't think it could be any more ridiculous than it already is.  Dan is a `grandpa' aged man who, after getting divorced for the first time, is urged by his best friend and business partner, Charlie, to live like a free man (`Freemont') in Miami.  There he meets Vicki.  They get married and then get it annulled but Dan cannot forget her.  Seven years later she basically shows up at his doorstep announcing that he is the father of twins and then goes off to prison for two weeks leaving Dan to watch the kids.  Well, the most preposterous part of it all is that she wasn't even really planning on him watching the kids.  She chose the day before she went to prison to introduce them to him.  The kids already had a babysitter, and it was a freak accident that left the kids in Dan's care.Who does that?The plot only gets more contrived and more ridiculous, and a lot of this is thanks to some awful acting.  Kelly Preston is beyond obnoxious and horrifically used here.  Travolta is even worse.  His performance is so `stupid' it reaches out beyond `stupid funny' and just becomes eye-rolling and stomach-churning.  He is trying so hard.  Robin Williams fares better than anyone else in the film, which isn't a huge feat, but like Kevin James in that `I Now Pronounce you Chuck and Larry' fiasco, at least he makes his character work to a certain degree.  Oh yeah, and Seth Green really should have been used more.Oh lord, and I totally forgot that they have a whole `human puppet' scene in here that is so preposterous my wife actually left the room to wash her face and brush her teeth for bed; and she was the one who forced me to rent this movie!In the end I am warning you all to stay far away.  There isn't anything here that remotely validates wasting an evening watching this film.  Do I hate that I saw it?  No.  Do I wish that I had watched something else?  Yes.  The zoo scene (the attacking penguins to be more specific) is funny, but it is the only scene that really even began to stir my `belly of laughs', and even at that it only got a chuckle.",1,Somewhere between `god' and `awful'...,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,2776,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'Old', 'Dogs', ""'m"", 'glad', 'had', 'expected', 'anything', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'mad', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'fact', 'expected', 'few', 'laughs', 'decent', 'time', 'waster', 'did', 'get', 'few', 'laughs', 'whole', 'zoo', 'scene', 'so', 'am', 'thankful.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'label', ""decent'."", 'Old', 'Dogs', 'far', 'whole', 'nothing', 'new', 'equation', 'Sure', 'nothing', 'Old', 'Dogs', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'also', 'far', 'whole', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'argument', 'fact', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'so', 'awful', 'really', 'have', 'other', 'words', 'describe', 'it.Just', 'plain', 'awful.Why', 'Let', 'start', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'already', 'Dan', 'grandpa', 'aged', 'man', 'who', 'getting', 'divorced', 'first', 'time', 'urged', 'best', 'friend', 'business', 'partner', 'Charlie', 'live', 'free', 'man', 'Freemont', 'Miami', 'Vicki', 'get', 'married', 'then', 'get', 'annulled', 'Dan', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'Seven', 'years', 'later', 'basically', 'up', 'doorstep', 'announcing', 'father', 'twins', 'then', 'prison', 'two', 'weeks', 'leaving', 'Dan', 'watch', 'kids', 'Well', 'most', 'preposterous', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'planning', 'watching', 'kids', 'chose', 'day', 'went', 'prison', 'introduce', 'kids', 'already', 'had', 'babysitter', 'was', 'freak', 'accident', 'left', 'kids', 'Dan', 'care.Who', 'plot', 'only', 'more', 'contrived', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'lot', 'thanks', 'awful', 'acting', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'obnoxious', 'horrifically', 'used', 'here', 'Travolta', 'even', 'worse', 'performance', 'so', 'stupid', 'out', 'stupid', 'funny', 'just', 'becomes', 'eye-rolling', 'stomach-churning', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', ""n't"", 'huge', 'feat', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'fiasco', 'least', 'character', 'work', 'certain', 'degree', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Seth', 'Green', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'more.Oh', 'lord', 'totally', 'forgot', 'have', 'whole', 'human', 'puppet', 'scene', 'here', 'so', 'preposterous', 'wife', 'actually', 'left', 'room', 'wash', 'face', 'brush', 'teeth', 'bed', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'forced', 'rent', 'movie', 'end', 'am', 'warning', 'stay', 'far', 'away', ""n't"", 'anything', 'here', 'remotely', 'wasting', 'evening', 'watching', 'film', 'Do', 'hate', 'saw', 'No', 'Do', 'wish', 'had', 'watched', 'something', 'else', 'Yes', 'zoo', 'scene', 'attacking', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'funny', 'only', 'scene', 'really', 'even', 'began', 'stir', 'belly', 'laughs', 'even', 'only', 'got', 'chuckle']",N/A

Every single joke that took place here failed miserably, especially that stupid tattoo on Robin Williams chest.  Very bad storytelling here.The movie finally got going as soon as Robin Williams character got a severe suntan because he was stuck inside the booth and a worker wasn't able to free him because she was distracted by John Travolta's beautiful face.My honest feelings while watching Old Dogs is that the writers severely rushed or didn't properly execute the majority of the storyline and jokes.  Many of the jokes moved at such a fast rate that they never really felt like they were given the appropriate amount of time needed to build into a solid, memorable joke.Lots of examples such as the groin shot at the golf game, the kids in the bathroom mixing up pills from the containers of both Robin Williams and John Travolta, the constant assumptions that both Robin and John were old men by everybody around town, and even the storyline involving both of them having to look after two kids... nothing really worked because everything felt totally rushed.Even the segments that WERE given the necessary amount of time to build into a solid segment just didn't work in the laughs department, such as when Robin Williams dressed up as a king and played a game of dress up with one of the kids.  I was bored here, and I believe most people will be as well.The only parts I honestly liked were the segments where Robin and Travolta unintentionally stumbled upon a huge area where an ape was living, and another segment where they both fell into the water and found out that adorable penguins aren't necessarily *lovable* pengiuns.The entire storyline devoted to the business in Japan completely fell flat, and forget about character development- there was none.I really like Robin Williams, but he didn't do much of anything in the way of laughter for me in Old Dogs.",3,pretty average,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1963,"['First', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'was', 'totally', 'bored', 'mind', 'single', 'joke', 'took', 'place', 'here', 'failed', 'miserably', 'especially', 'stupid', 'tattoo', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'chest', 'Very', 'bad', 'storytelling', 'here.The', 'movie', 'finally', 'got', 'going', 'as', 'soon', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'character', 'got', 'severe', 'suntan', 'was', 'stuck', 'booth', 'worker', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'free', 'was', 'distracted', 'John', 'Travolta', 'beautiful', 'face.My', 'honest', 'feelings', 'watching', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'writers', 'severely', 'rushed', 'did', ""n't"", 'properly', 'execute', 'majority', 'storyline', 'jokes', 'Many', 'jokes', 'moved', 'fast', 'rate', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'were', 'given', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'time', 'needed', 'build', 'solid', 'memorable', 'joke.Lots', 'examples', 'such', 'groin', 'shot', 'golf', 'game', 'kids', 'bathroom', 'mixing', 'up', 'pills', 'containers', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'John', 'Travolta', 'constant', 'assumptions', 'Robin', 'John', 'were', 'old', 'men', 'everybody', 'town', 'even', 'storyline', 'involving', 'having', 'look', 'two', 'kids', 'nothing', 'really', 'worked', 'everything', 'felt', 'totally', 'rushed.Even', 'segments', 'WERE', 'given', 'necessary', 'amount', 'time', 'build', 'solid', 'segment', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'laughs', 'department', 'such', 'when', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'dressed', 'up', 'king', 'played', 'game', 'dress', 'one', 'kids', 'was', 'bored', 'here', 'believe', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'well.The', 'only', 'parts', 'honestly', 'liked', 'were', 'segments', 'where', 'Robin', 'Travolta', 'unintentionally', 'stumbled', 'huge', 'area', 'where', 'ape', 'was', 'living', 'segment', 'where', 'fell', 'water', 'found', 'out', 'adorable', 'penguins', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', '*lovable*', 'pengiuns.The', 'entire', 'storyline', 'devoted', 'business', 'Japan', 'completely', 'fell', 'flat', 'forget', 'character', 'development-', 'was', 'none.I', 'really', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'way', 'laughter', 'Old', 'Dogs']",N/A

While there were some funny things in the movie for the most part I found it predictable.The main storyline is that Charlie (Travolta) and Dan (Williams) have been friends and business partners for 30 years. Right before a big deal Dan finds out a woman he impulsively married 7 years before wants to see him. She tells him that she had his twins that he has to take care of for two weeks because she is going to jail.There were some funny scenes, but the thing that would take me out of the movie was that Kelly Preston was playing Dans wife and Ella Bleu Travolta was one of the twins.

1325564,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0034GK78C,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 2]","John Travolta and Robin Williams have been friends for decades but have never worked together on film.  That was until the release of the film ""Old Dogs"" directed by Walt Becker (""Wild Hogs"", ""Van Wilder"") and features a screenplay by David Diamond (""Minutemen"", ""The Family Man"") and David Weissman (""Minutemen"", ""Evolution"", ""Family Man"").  The film features cinematography from Jeffrey L. Kimball (""Mission: Impossible II"", ""Star Trek: Nemesis"", ""Hostage"") and music composed by John Debney (""Aliens in the Attic"", ""Evan Almight"", ""Iron Man 2"") and would feature many talent including Kelly Preston, Lori Loughlin, Bernie Mac, Seth Green, Matt Dillon, Ann-Margret, Rita Wilson, Amy Sedaris, Justin Long and many more.The film would also be known as the last feature film for comedian/actor Bernie Mac who passed away several months after the film was completed and despite negative critic reviews, similar to Walt Becker's previous film ""Wild Hogs"" (which garnered negative reviews but made an extreme amount of money), ""Old Dogs"" which cost $35 million to make, has made over $81 million worldwide in the box office guaranteeing another box office success for Becker and crew.""Old Dogs"" revolves around a two best friends since grade school.  Charlie Reed (played by John Travolta) and Dan Rayburn (Robin Williams) are successful partners of Rayburn+Reed, a successful sports marketing firm.While Charlie is a flirt with the women and lives in a stylish apartment with his very old dog, Dan has had his share of personal problems after his first divorce seven years ago.  So, one day Charlie takes Dan to a vacation and hook up with Vicki (played by Travolta's real life wife, Kelly Preston) and her weird friend/hand model Jenna (played by Rita Wilson). And somehow after many drinks, Dan who had tried to get a tattoo that says ""Free Man"" instead gets a tattoo that says ""Fremont"" across his chest and also manages to get married with Vicki.The marriage is short lived and seven years later, while Charlie and Dan along with budding executive Ralph White (played by Seth Green) and translator Amanda (Lori Loughlin) are trying to land a very lucrative Japanese account, Dan receives a letter from Vicki.  Excited that Vicki wants to meet with him, Dan thinks that maybe Vicki wants to have a serious relationship but during the course of their meeting over dinner, finds out that Vicki is heading to jail for two weeks for an activist crime and felt it was time for Dan to know the truth.  That Dan is the father of two seven-year-old fraternal twins: Zach (played by Conner Rayburn) and Emily (played by Ella Bleu Travolta).Before she goes to jail, she just wants Dan to know his children and shocked Dan is.  Charlie is not so thrilled because they have a major account to work on but nevertheless, gives his best friend support.Dan goes with Vicki and the children to a few places and starts to become acquainted with them but its evident that he's not used to being around children.  But as they bring the children to stay with Jenna for the two weeks that Vicki is in jail, Dan accidentally slams his car trunk on Jenna's fingers and also has the trunk flip open and hit her on the face.With Jenna now hospitalized and Vicki going to jail, Dan volunteers to take care of the kids for the next two weeks.  And because Dan's apartment does not allow children, he and the kids must stay at Charlie's place and now the two are forced to be like parents to both Zach and Emily while trying to gain this major Japanese account.Can these two ""old dogs"" win the Japanese account and also raise two children in two weeks?VIDEO:""Old Dogs"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Fortunately, ""Old Dogs"" is shot in daylight conditions.  So, there is a good amount of colors featured in the film and also the HD definitely brings out the skin pores and also the hairyness of Robin Williams as detail is quite evident.  But for the most part, the film is vibrant and follows the tradition of fantastic picture quality from Disney.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Old Digs"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and also French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For the most part, the film is front and center channel driven as the film is primarily dialogue and music driven.  Dialogue and music are very clear with a few use of the surround channels when you hear the creaking of Charlie and Dan's bones or when they participate in a frisbee game and get continuously tackled.  Overall, lossless audio is satisfactory for this type of film.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Old Dogs"" comes with a few special features presented in 1080p High Definition and 480 i with audio in English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital with English SDH subtitles.  Included are:* Audio Commentary by Director Walt Becker, screenplay writers David Diamond and David Weissman and Producer Andrew Panay - A lively audio commentary by the four men discussing the film and working with the talent and seeing the film for the first time.* Bloopers - (2:26) Bloopers form ""Old Dogs"".* Young Dogs Learn Old Tricks - (2:51) Conner Rayburn interviews Robin Williams and Ella Bleu Travolta interviews her father John Travolta.* Deleted Scenes - (3:30) Three deleted scenes: Body Check, Pate, Alternate Ending Tag: Tables Turned.* Music Videos - Two music videos featuring Bryan Adams singing ""You've Been a Friend to Me"" and John Travolta singing ""Every Little Step"" (a Bobby Brown cover) with his daughter Ella.EXTRAS:""Old Dogs"" features a 3-Disc Combo Pack which includes the DVD version of the film and a digital copy.JUDGMENT CALL:If you enjoyed ""Wild Hogs"", you'll more than likely enjoy ""Old Dogs""!It's kind of interesting because back in the '60s we would get a good amount of films featuring older talent being friends, single and having fun.  May it be the Rat Pack or Lemmon and Matthau and really, there haven't been any comedy films with older men who are living their lives ala youthful in their late 40's or early 50's.I have to admit when the film started off with the photoshopped heads of Travolta and Williams  on other people's bodies (which some looked unrealistic) trying to show that they have been friends since they were kids, right away I was thinking ""this movie is going to suck!"".But as the film went on, the film started to become entertaining.  Sure, it is a bit silly and contrived but it kind of reminded me of the ""3 Men and a Baby"" films.  Two bachelors who are trying to take care of two young children.  They don't know how but they try to do their best.  Granted, ""3 Men and a Baby"" was much more entertaining film but despite the critics really despising Walt Becker's films, somehow both ""Wild Hogs"" and ""Old Dogs"" have managed to make a lot of money!  The film does feature quite a bit of all-star talent but they are cameos at best but the most notable is Bernie Mac in his final character role in a film.Is this film suitable for the children?  I watched this with my seven year old and there is no profanity and there is no adult situations but there is one scene where the guys get involved in a frisbee matchup and things get a bit out of hand (Justin Long starts bleeding from the mouth) but that is probably the extent the violence.  Everything else is appropriate for the children.As for the Blu-ray release, ""Old Dogs"" comes with a DVD and digital copy.  The high definition features really good picture quality and lossless audio that is satisfactory for the film.  If anything, viewers get to see Robin Williams strip down (to get a tan) and the Blu-ray brings out the comedian's hairy body which I'm sure that is not what one would want to see that close in high definition.""Old Dogs"" is not terrible and I know the concept of a film about bachelor older men has not been captured in a similar format as the women in a film such as ""Sex and the City"" but for the most part, ""Wild Hogs"" and ""Old Dogs"" are films that do well in the box office.  These films even since the '80's with comedies such as ""Three Men and a Baby"" and ""The Three Amigos"" featuring bachelor men have done well in the theater despite critical scrutiny.  People just want a popcorn flick and laugh, even if the jokes may be mediocre.Overall, ""Old Dogs"" is far from being bad or terrible.  It's a comedy that I was entertained and laughed, felt a little embarrassed of certain scenes and at the end, me and my younger son enjoyed parts of it and found certain scenes to be quite silly.  But we were entertained.  Although, the wife felt it was more of a film for the guys and was not amused by it.""Old Dogs"" 3-Disc Combo Pack on Blu-ray will be released on March 9th.",3,"Blu-ray: If you enjoyed Walt Becker's

1325572,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0034GK78C,Enjolras,"[16, 21]","[3.5 stars].Old Dogsis a mix of Disney-style kid's movie and a bizarre Robin Williams comedy. On the one hand, it is funny at times. It executes classic jokes like the golfer hitting a bystander in the groins fairly well. On the other hand, a lot of the jokes were clearly aimed at a pretty young and immature audience, like the gorilla hugging Seth Green. I don't mind kid-friendly humor, and in fact found this a lot better than the vulgar comedies aimed at teens. However,Old Dogsseems to be trying to appeal to both kids and adults, but I don't think it does.I think part of the reason is the casting. Again, here I had mixed feelings. The acting was generally was very good for this type of movie. In addition to Robin Williams and John Travolta, it also included Seth Green, Kelly Preston, Matt Dillon, Bernie Mac, and Lori Laughlin (the little girl, Travolta's daughter, was also adorable). Yet, it might have been a bit too crowded. Rather than falling in love with the kids, I felt like I barely got to know them. At times, Travolta and Williams seemed to get a good dynamic, but it just wasn't enough.Overall, this will probably be a satisfying comedy for ""family nights."" It's funny enough for parents to enjoy, but probably won't be particularly memorable. I was disappointed though that it wasn't better, especially given the great comedic talent in the cast. I'd be willing to give anOld Dogssequel a try with the same cast, assuming the writers and directors really put some thought into coming up with a funny script.",3,"Sometimes funny, sometimes lame",1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,1533,"['[', '3.5', 'stars', ']', '.Old', 'Dogsis', 'mix', 'Disney-style', 'kid', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'comedy', 'one', 'hand', 'funny', 'times', 'classic', 'jokes', 'golfer', 'hitting', 'bystander', 'groins', 'fairly', 'well', 'other', 'hand', 'lot', 'jokes', 'were', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'pretty', 'young', 'immature', 'audience', 'gorilla', 'hugging', 'Seth', 'Green', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'kid-friendly', 'humor', 'fact', 'found', 'lot', 'better', 'vulgar', 'comedies', 'aimed', 'teens', 'However', 'Old', 'Dogsseems', 'be', 'trying', 'appeal', 'kids', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'think', 'part', 'reason', 'casting', 'Again', 'here', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'acting', 'was', 'generally', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'type', 'movie', 'addition', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'John', 'Travolta', 'also', 'included', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Lori', 'Laughlin', 'little', 'girl', 'Travolta', 'daughter', 'was', 'also', 'adorable', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'too', 'crowded', 'Rather', 'falling', 'love', 'kids', 'felt', 'barely', 'got', 'know', 'times', 'Travolta', 'Williams', 'seemed', 'get', 'good', 'dynamic', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough.Overall', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'satisfying', 'comedy', 'family', 'nights', 'funny', 'enough', 'parents', 'enjoy', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'especially', 'given', 'great', 'comedic', 'talent', 'cast', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'give', 'anOld', 'Dogssequel', 'try', 'same', 'cast', 'assuming', 'writers', 'directors', 'really', 'put', 'thought', 'coming', 'up', 'funny', 'script']",N/A

They have been in business for many years and are on the verge of landing their biggest account from a Japanese firm.  As the date for closing the business deal draws near, Dan receives some unexpected news.  Apparently, while on vacation, Dan had a brief relationship with Vicki (Kelly Preston).  Now, seven years later, Vicki has written to Dan to tell them that he's the father of her 7-year-old fraternal twins.To make matters worse, Vicki has been sentenced to serve two weeks in prison for staging an illegal protest.  Originally, Vicki's friend was going to watch the children, but Dan slammed her hands in the trunk of her car, causing her to go to the hospital.  Realizing that there's no other choice, Dan volunteers to watch the kids, much to Charlie's chagrin.Dan tries to catch up for lost time with the kids, while Charlie continues to work and worry about the business deal.  It's clear that Dan has no understanding of how to relate to children, but as the movie goes along, Dan and even Charlie begin to truly care for the kids.  In the meantime, Ralph (Seth Griffin) has been sent to Japan to work on the deal with the Japanese.  Unfortunately, he only makes things more difficult.  The Japanese soon request that in order to close the deal, Dan and Charlie must move to Tokyo.  How will this demand affect Dan's budding relationship with Vicki and the kids?This is a very funny movie.  John Travolta and Robin Williams give excellent performances, and Kelly Preston is funny as well.  The story is good, and it's nice to see the relationship between Dan and his children grow.

One day, one of the men find out he has two kids with a lady he met a long time ago.  The lady has to go away for 2 weeks and she can not find any one to watch her kids.  The man tells her that he will do it.  It's hard for him at first.  I mean, he never had kids and isn't good with them when he is around them.  He learns what thing should be and are most important to him in life.  If you take the movie to seriously then I guess you could find fault with it.  That though is the case with any movie.

We got next to no laughs from it; the best parts of the preview were about the only decent things here.It's all so predictable, and got boring fast. It was clearly made for adults as well as kids but said nothing to me, and I can only imagine that most kids these days are a little brighter than this film gives them credit for, yet not ""adult"" enough to get or even care about the lame corporate jokes. The weirdly racist Japanese businessmen scene does the flick no favors, and the jokes throughout these long 88 minutes are just flat. Matt Dillon is wasted in a badly written bit part, and in general this just ain't very funny.It must have been a vanity project for Travolta, as his wife and daughter are both in it, and both as hapless as he, though his daughter is probably the best actor of the three here. Old Dogs is technically well-made, but so painfully predictable in most every way. All in all, I'd say this is about at the bottom of the list for both kids and adults.

We laughed out loud several times which I consider a must for a successful comedy.  I was pleased to find that there was plenty of fun throughout the movie rather than the only funny parts being those that were advertised on TV, which seems to happen often with comedies.  The part where they got their medicine mixed up was predictable (you knew it was going to happen somehow) but very funny nonetheless.  I thought it was neat how they incorporated flashback scenes in the movie and those were funny as well.  I also enjoyed the beginning where they took old pictures of both Robin Willians and John Travolta and put them together to show them as friends since childhood.  As someone who remembers Robin from his Mork days and John from his Welcome Back Kotter days, that was a lot of fun.  I was also reminded why I had a crush on John Travolta back in 6th grade.  His is still pretty easy on the eyes.  He has the talent to play a bad guy or a good guy.  He plays the good guy great in this movie.  Robin William's talent goes without saying.The movie was appropriate for families.  My 12 year old son would have loved it.  The kids were cute and did a good job.  The little girl is Travolta's own daughter and she has her fathers beautiful eyes.If you are in the mood for a fun comedy to enjoy then I highly recommend this movie.",5,We loved this movie,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,1411,"['husband', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'weekend', 'loved', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'several', 'times', 'consider', 'must', 'successful', 'comedy', 'was', 'pleased', 'find', 'was', 'plenty', 'fun', 'movie', 'rather', 'only', 'funny', 'parts', 'being', 'were', 'advertised', 'TV', 'happen', 'often', 'comedies', 'part', 'where', 'got', 'medicine', 'mixed', 'up', 'was', 'predictable', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'somehow', 'very', 'funny', 'nonetheless', 'thought', 'was', 'neat', 'how', 'incorporated', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'beginning', 'where', 'took', 'old', 'pictures', 'Robin', 'Willians', 'John', 'Travolta', 'put', 'together', 'show', 'friends', 'childhood', 'someone', 'who', 'Robin', 'Mork', 'days', 'John', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', 'days', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'was', 'also', 'reminded', 'why', 'had', 'crush', 'John', 'Travolta', 'back', '6th', 'grade', 'still', 'pretty', 'easy', 'eyes', 'talent', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'great', 'movie', 'Robin', 'William', 'talent', 'saying.The', 'movie', 'was', 'appropriate', 'families', '12', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'kids', 'were', 'cute', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'little', 'girl', 'Travolta', 'own', 'daughter', 'fathers', 'beautiful', 'are', 'mood', 'fun', 'comedy', 'enjoy', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

El-Hewie""","[3, 12]","Watching Robin Williams in such senile, slow, and tight shape detracted my attention from his comical performance. Williams used to ignite the screen in his prime years. In this movie, his acting as a drug-impaired was forcible and predictable. One could sense the total lack of improvisation in Williams' effort to display his loss of sense of distance.John Travolta's overweight, congested veins and swollen neck created another distraction. His episode of insatiable appetite as an accidentally impaired victim was introduced by long and silly introduction on the side effects of the pills he swallowed. The movie took too long to explain the impending intoxication joke, yet to show dismal acting by relying on two drained old stars.In contrast, the unimpeded acting of Travolta's daughter, Ella Bleu saved long minutes of the artificial performance of the two struggling actors. Ella compensated for her dad's negligence of his health by her angelical childhood of untainted improvisation.Seth Green also made up for the downfalls and restricted personalities of the two old dogs.  Green needed no trigger to get him fire up, as opposed to Travolta's constant attempts to keep his belly tight and avoid falling asleep.The scenario of urban New Yorkers' lifestyle of coping with the madness of the  expansiveness of business at the expense of abandoning the old tradition of  family closeness might fall within the category of making movies about movies. The movie was clattered with cultural events that remotely relate to most of the viewers. Plenty of time was spent on childproofing an apartment with 15-feet deep swimming pool, dog funeral, and unusually inserted actresses that appeared more like movie stars than ordinary people.The uplifting spirit of the movie was the display of New Yorkers' tolerance to others' shortcomings. The three business partners stuck together despite the exceptional burdens created by their association.

Lots of aging jokes and self-deprecating humor, lots of wacky antics, painful gags, and absurd situations, but all in the service of a ""bromantic"" comedy about settling down and accepting fatherhood.Travolta and Williams play old friends and business partners, no longer in their prime.  While Travolta's character refuses to grow up, Williams' refuses to live for anything other than work, having suffered too much heartbreak.  Just when it looks like things are looking up, and they are about to close the biggest marketing deal of their lives with a Japanese sporting goods company, Williams' character reconnects with an old flame, discovers he is a father and gets stuck taking care of the kids, and is in over his head.  Immediately it's obvious this is going to follow the lines of the classic Hollywood mainstay, the work versus family comedy, where we see all the ways that having a family complicates work, but all the ways that work and money is worthless without family.The film hits all the usual plot points we've come to know and love from this kind of family flick: the comic misunderstandings; forced and sudden choices between love and money, between company and kids; last minute reconciliations requiring risky road trips and other illegal activities; and surprisingly wise advice coming from the mouths of children, who manage to alternate between annoying and cloying.  Add to that some classic old buddy mishaps, cute dog tricks and other funny animal behaviors, some (moderately offensive, probably, to the stereotypical Japanese managers depicted here) cross-cultural confusion humor, and obviously clueless parenting hijinks.  Some of it, surprisingly, works quite well -- I found myself laughing aloud more often than I expected (the pharmaceutical mix-ups and Seth Green's encounter with a nurturing gorilla, for example) -- and some of it falls flat (the Bernie Mac cameo and the elaborate gizmo he employs to help Williams figure out how to get through a tea party with his newly discovered daughter, was an extremely odd and not very funny bit).  Overall, though, I think the movie manages to hit the ""sweet spot"" they seemed to be aiming for: to be more or less accessible and amusing for adults, while having enough silliness to keep kids entertained, and all while including enough crazy cameos to ensure it wouldn't do badly at the box office.

Kyle,"[4, 8]","The previews had me pretty excited about seeing Robin Williams and John Travolta acting together even if the film was--what, a geezer flick?The story is two old friends, Dan (Williams) and Charlie (Travolta) do everything from business to dating together.  When Dan's first marriage failed about eight years prior, Charlie got Dan to go to Florida for a fun-filled vacation where Dan got drunk, got a bad tattoo, and got married and annulled.What Dan didn't realize until eight years later was he also got his wife Vicki (Kelly Preston) pregnant with twins. When Vicki has to go to jail for two weeks, she entrusts Zack (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta) with Dan.Dan is not only not good with kids, he's astronomically bad.  Since Charlie got him into this mess, he's getting Charlie to help.  Unfortunately, this whole episode occurs when the pair are trying to land a huge sports marketing deal with a Japanese firm.""Old Dogs"" is not without some good laughs and some warm-hearted moments, but the man-discovers-kids theme and enlists friends for help was probably best in ""Three Men and a Baby"".

Zwick,"[19, 28]","In the insufferable and unwatchable ""Old Dogs,"" John Travolta and Robin Williams play longtime Manhattan business partners who've been best friends since high school.  One's a superannuated swinging bachelor (I'll let you guess which); the other's a divorced commitment-phobe who suddenly discovers that he's the father of two fraternal twins from a woman (Kelly Preston) he briefly married, then got an annulment from, seven years earlier.  Now that the kids are in his life, Williams is learning what it means to be a daddy - movie-comedy style, that is.I guess there must be an audience out there for these dumbed-down daddy-day-care scenarios, featuring grown men who are more childish and immature than the kids they`re supposed to be raising, but, frankly, I don't get the appeal.  Suffice it to say, the script - a gruesome combination of painfully contrived setups, unfunny jokes, teeth-grinding sentimentality and stunningly desperate slapstick routines - feels as if it were written by a not particularly gifted third-grader; the direction is low-grade and cheesy, and the acting consists of little more than nonstop mugging for the camera.  It even employs the oldest family-comedy standby of them all: a cutesy dog for cutaway reaction shots that are somehow supposed to make the whole thing even more side-splitting and hilarious than it already is.  (And, in deference to their careers, we hesitate to even mention that Bernie Mac, Ann-Margret, and Matt Dillon drop in for some ill-advised cameos, which I`m sure they`ve since come to regret).This may not be the worst movie ever made by either Travolta or Williams, but it's certainly right down there vying for the title.

1325614,ATJRTEOGW5OZN,B0034GK78C,Rons Reviews,"[2, 3]","With a plot that is too contrived for adults, and contains nothing to which children can relate, there is no audience for this film.  Nonetheless Disney sent this eighty-eight minute (Which happens to be about as long as it was in theatres) dog to store shelves on March 9th 2010 in a set that includes a Blu-Ray, DVD, and digital copy, thus providing you and your family with three ways to avoid ""Old Dogs"".In ""Old Dogs"" Disney somehow managed to get John Travolta, Robin Williams, Seth Green, Kelly Preston, Matt Dillon, Rita Wilson, Bernie Mac, and Ann Margret to participate in a script so thrown together and contrived, that it is a mystery how it ever got sold. It's bad enough that Travolta and his wife Kelly Preston are in this, but to have allowed their child (Daughter Ella) to participate should be considered a form of child abuse.In ""Old Dogs"" Travolta and Williams are life long friends and co-owners of some sort of sports related marketing company, which like other aspects of this film, is loosely defined.  Seven years earlier Travolta had taken Williams to Florida to help him get over his divorce. One night in Florida, they get drunk, Williams gets a tattoo on his chest, meets a woman (Preston), gets married, has sex, and gets an annulment. Preston shows up (present day) to let Williams know that she has to go to jail for two weeks, and that he is the father of twins (Conner Rayburn and Ella Blue Travolta). Yup, it's got Disney family film written all over it. So Williams and Travolta end up being saddled with the care of the children for two weeks while negotiating the biggest deal in the history of their company.Since there is little introduction to the children or exploration into true childcare issues, ridiculous scenarios are introduced such as people taking the wrong medication and then dealing with the side effects of said medication.  Again, a great comedic vehicle for a family film.  Even more contrived is Travolta's soliciting the help of friend and children's entertainer Jimmy Lunchbox (A wasted Bernie Mac in what would sadly be his last film) who helps turn Williams into a human puppet so that he can better relate to his children.One cannot help but feel for these actors as they clearly realize they are in a poorly written film and thus try desperately to breathe life into dead scenes.  Unfortunately this results in what appears to be some of the worst over acting seen on screen in years.The bonus material includes a blooper reel on the Blu-Ray and DVD that is so poorly edited that it is impossible to appreciate, audio commentary, and deleted scenes.  The audio commentary is more distracting than anything else, and the deleted scenes deserved to be deleted. The packaging indicated music videos on both the DVD and Blu-Ray, but they did not appear to be on the DVD.Recommendation: The release of this film was delayed three times:  According to Disney, the postponements were due to the death of Bernie Mac, Travolta's son, and the health issue faced by Williams. The poor quality of the film should have been the reason, and it should have resulted in the project being scrapped long before filming began. There is nothing here worth your time or money.  Wait for it to come out on television, which, based on its brief stay in theatres should not be long, and then watch something else.",1,Old Dogs.,1270857600,"04 10, 2010",2010,3352,"['plot', 'too', 'contrived', 'adults', 'nothing', 'children', 'can', 'relate', 'audience', 'film', 'Nonetheless', 'Disney', 'sent', 'eighty-eight', 'minute', 'Which', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'long', 'was', 'theatres', 'dog', 'store', 'shelves', 'March', '9th', '2010', 'set', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', 'thus', 'providing', 'family', 'three', 'ways', 'avoid', 'Old', 'Dogs', '.In', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'Disney', 'somehow', 'managed', 'get', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Ann', 'Margret', 'participate', 'script', 'so', 'thrown', 'together', 'contrived', 'mystery', 'how', 'ever', 'got', 'sold', 'bad', 'enough', 'Travolta', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'are', 'have', 'allowed', 'child', 'Daughter', 'Ella', 'participate', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'form', 'child', 'abuse.In', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'Travolta', 'Williams', 'are', 'life', 'long', 'friends', 'co-owners', 'sort', 'sports', 'related', 'marketing', 'company', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'loosely', 'defined', 'Seven', 'years', 'earlier', 'Travolta', 'had', 'taken', 'Williams', 'Florida', 'help', 'get', 'divorce', 'One', 'night', 'Florida', 'get', 'drunk', 'Williams', 'tattoo', 'chest', 'woman', 'Preston', 'married', 'sex', 'annulment', 'Preston', 'up', 'present', 'day', 'let', 'Williams', 'know', 'go', 'jail', 'two', 'weeks', 'father', 'twins', 'Conner', 'Rayburn', 'Ella', 'Blue', 'Travolta', 'Yup', 'got', 'Disney', 'family', 'film', 'written', 'Williams', 'Travolta', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'saddled', 'care', 'children', 'two', 'weeks', 'negotiating', 'biggest', 'deal', 'history', 'company.Since', 'little', 'introduction', 'children', 'exploration', 'true', 'childcare', 'issues', 'ridiculous', 'scenarios', 'are', 'introduced', 'such', 'people', 'taking', 'wrong', 'medication', 'then', 'dealing', 'side', 'effects', 'said', 'medication', 'Again', 'great', 'comedic', 'vehicle', 'family', 'film', 'Even', 'more', 'contrived', 'Travolta', 'soliciting', 'help', 'friend', 'children', 'entertainer', 'Jimmy', 'Lunchbox', 'A', 'wasted', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'what', 'would', 'sadly', 'be', 'last', 'film', 'who', 'turn', 'Williams', 'human', 'puppet', 'so', 'can', 'better', 'relate', 'children.One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'actors', 'clearly', 'realize', 'are', 'poorly', 'written', 'film', 'thus', 'try', 'desperately', 'breathe', 'life', 'dead', 'scenes', 'Unfortunately', 'results', 'what', 'be', 'worst', 'acting', 'seen', 'screen', 'years.The', 'bonus', 'material', 'blooper', 'reel', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'so', 'poorly', 'edited', 'impossible', 'appreciate', 'audio', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'more', 'distracting', 'anything', 'else', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'deserved', 'be', 'deleted', 'packaging', 'indicated', 'music', 'videos', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'DVD.Recommendation', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'delayed', 'three', 'times', 'According', 'Disney', 'postponements', 'were', 'due', 'death', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Travolta', 'son', 'health', 'issue', 'faced', 'Williams', 'poor', 'quality', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'should', 'have', 'resulted', 'project', 'being', 'scrapped', 'long', 'before', 'filming', 'began', 'nothing', 'here', 'time', 'money', 'Wait', 'come', 'out', 'television', 'based', 'brief', 'stay', 'theatres', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'long', 'then', 'watch', 'something', 'else']",N/A

Dan volunteers to keep the tykes, although he's up tight and clueless. I watch this movie with some friends expecting not to like it. The only reason that made me think it wasn't gonna be garbage was the great cast, so I gave it a shot. I was surprised to say I actually sort of liked it. The movie stars Robin Williams and John Travolta as Dan and Charlie, two businessmen and long-time best friends.  The surprise element of this movie is that it's actually pretty funny. It doesn't hurt that a great supporting cast including Lori Loughlin, Justin Long, Matt Dillon, Seth Green, and the late Bernie Mac are in it. Obviously this is not a perfect movie, and it's not for everyone, but I certainly found it funny enough.

I've seen most of their films (including ""Popeye"" and ""Staying Alive""), and Disney's new comedy ""Old Dogs"" also includes Kelly Preston, Ella Bleu Travolta (daughter of John Travolta and Kelly Preston), Matt Dillon, Seth Green, Bernie Mac (his last film), Lori Loughlin, Ann-Margret, Rita Wilson, and uncredited Luis Guzman, Dax Shepard and Justin Long.OK, pretty impressive, so I saw the film. Sorry, but ""Old Dogs"" is just terrible. It is as if they had made another sequel of ""Daddy Day Care"" when we already have (a very bad) one.Charlie (Travolta) and Dan (Williams) are business partners and friends. They are co-owners of the sports marketing company and are about to close a profitable deal with a Japanese company when Vicky (Preston) shows up with two 7-year-old children Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta). Vicky and Dan were married for a very short time seven years before, and she asks him to take care of the kids for her for two weeks.But the film's incoherent story is just as an excuse for jokes to be strung together. This is not a bad thing as long as jokes are funny. The jokes of ""Old Dogs"" are all tired, clich&eacute;d ones, for example, John Travolta and his facial paralysis; Rita Wilson getting her hands slammed (with The Four Seasons hit song ""Big Girls Don't Cry""); Seth Green cuddled by a gorilla; and Robin Williams as ""Oompa Loompa."" The last one really made me sad.""Old Dogs"" is not as bad as ""Battlefield Earth"" (which I take as a comedy); perhaps slightly better than ""License to Wed.""

Never have I seen a big-budget movie as unsure about what it intends to be as Disney's Old Dogs.  The entire time this movie one thought constantly ran through my head: ""Why?""  Why waste the talents of John Travolta and Robin Williams?  Why did these actors sign up for this mess?  I can usually find redeeming qualities in a movie but this movie is just a mess of - dare I say it - epic proportions.The plot is inane as it is confusing.  It's a story about a father taking care of his kids (generic as can be!) but with odd slapstick that I swear reaches a surreal level in how utterly absurd the situations become.  I realized this in a scene where they take the kids to Charlie's (Travolta) apartment which has a ""no kids rule.""  An old woman spots them and suddenly a siren goes off as if there were an air strike.  Why?  Because the plot says so!  To top this off the film ends with a ""Kids want a hero"" plot that comes out of nowhere, and I do mean NOWHERE that involves Robin Williams in a jetpack that can't help but remind me of Schwarzenegger in 'Jingle All The Way' (that is NOT a good sign).There is no question in anybody's mind that John Travolta hit his lowest point with 'Battlefield Earth', but this has to be the worst I've ever seen Robin Williams!  Robin Williams has had lots of ups and downs in his career, and I know the Academy Award winning actor/comedian has been in some bad movies, but this is a new low for him.  Why?  Because to be honest, Robin Williams is clearly not having fun with this movie!  Good grief, him and Travolta seem to be trying, but they also seem well aware that the material isn't funny.  Williams seems tired.  Anyone who knows anything about Williams should know his approach to comedy is anything but reserved. If John Travolta can't even look like he's having a good time with his own kids as the children leads then that also raises some serious issues.This movie is a confused bunch of clich&eacute;s with no discernable plot and two talented leads who aren't having any fun.  There are far better family comedies out there and this one is to be avoided.  Ignore this dribble as I'm sure Travolta and Williams are already doing.",1,Title is fitting seeing as the two leads clearly had no fun with this turkey!,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,2235,"['really', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'define', 'movie', 'Never', 'have', 'seen', 'big-budget', 'movie', 'unsure', 'what', 'be', 'Disney', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'entire', 'time', 'movie', 'one', 'thought', 'constantly', 'ran', 'head', 'Why', 'Why', 'waste', 'talents', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Why', 'did', 'actors', 'sign', 'up', 'mess', 'can', 'usually', 'find', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'movie', 'movie', 'just', 'mess', 'dare', 'say', 'proportions.The', 'plot', 'inane', 'confusing', 'story', 'father', 'taking', 'care', 'kids', 'generic', 'can', 'be', 'odd', 'slapstick', 'swear', 'surreal', 'level', 'how', 'utterly', 'absurd', 'situations', 'become', 'realized', 'scene', 'where', 'take', 'kids', 'Charlie', 'Travolta', 'apartment', 'kids', 'rule', 'old', 'woman', 'spots', 'suddenly', 'siren', 'off', 'were', 'air', 'strike', 'Why', 'plot', 'so', 'top', 'off', 'film', 'Kids', 'want', 'hero', 'plot', 'nowhere', 'do', 'mean', 'NOWHERE', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'jetpack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'remind', 'Schwarzenegger', ""'Jingle"", 'All', 'Way', 'NOT', 'good', 'sign', 'question', 'anybody', 'mind', 'John', 'Travolta', 'hit', 'lowest', 'point', ""'Battlefield"", 'Earth', 'be', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'had', 'lots', 'ups', 'downs', 'career', 'know', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actor/comedian', 'been', 'bad', 'movies', 'new', 'low', 'Why', 'be', 'honest', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'clearly', 'not', 'having', 'fun', 'movie', 'Good', 'grief', 'Travolta', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'also', 'seem', 'well', 'aware', 'material', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Williams', 'tired', 'Anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'Williams', 'should', 'know', 'approach', 'comedy', 'anything', 'reserved', 'John', 'Travolta', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'own', 'kids', 'children', 'then', 'also', 'serious', 'issues.This', 'movie', 'confused', 'bunch', 'clich', 'eacute', 'discernable', 'plot', 'two', 'talented', 'leads', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'having', 'fun', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'family', 'there', 'one', 'be', 'avoided', 'Ignore', 'dribble', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Travolta', 'Williams', 'are', 'already', 'doing']",N/A
