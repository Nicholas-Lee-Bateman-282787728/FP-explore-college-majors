The whole cast is great, but Alicia Silverstone is unforgettable.It is a pinnacle leading role for actresses in teen movies.She simply sparkles from scene one.An who could ever forget the sets and costumes??Simply, a classic in the genre, and one of the best comedies of the nineties.A weekend popcorn movie to curl up in bed with that also has wit and charisma and intelligence to boot.Not to mention, its still not old after the fifth billion time.",5,THE ULTIMATE TEEN MOVIE-A CLASSIC,1085616000,"05 27, 2004",2004,1215,"['love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'even', 'worth', 'talking', 'words', 'will', 'express', 'what', 'brilliantly', 'put', 'together', 'acted', 'written', 'presented', 'film', 'is.And', 'talk', 'feel-good', 'FUN.Also', 'Clueless', 'living', 'proof', 'are', 'teen', 'comedies', 'there', 'are', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'top', 'shallow.Yes', 'Clueless', 'light', 'fluffy', 'film', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'be', 'light', 'fluffy', 'entertaining', 'just', 'fine.And', 'goal', 'perfectly-Clueless', 'film', 'second', 'none', 'genre.What', 'apart', 'other', 'dumb', 'tripe', 'there', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'most', 'weary', 'grown-ups', 'great', 'cast', 'unbelievably', 'witty', 'writing', 'irresistable', 'storylines', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'whole', 'cast', 'great', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'unforgettable.It', 'pinnacle', 'leading', 'role', 'actresses', 'teen', 'movies.She', 'simply', 'scene', 'one.An', 'who', 'could', 'ever', 'forget', 'sets', 'costumes', 'Simply', 'classic', 'genre', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'nineties.A', 'weekend', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'curl', 'up', 'bed', 'also', 'wit', 'charisma', 'intelligence', 'boot.Not', 'mention', 'still', 'not', 'old', 'fifth', 'billion', 'time']",Clueless VHS

386632,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,6303853102,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 3]","Clueless is a thoroughly delightful film, this edition improves on it with excellent bonus features - all are good, but Fashion 101 is not to be missed.Despite its glossy veneer - a world populated by attractive, narcissistic, and privileged kids - Clueless is a smart, droll, endearing look inside youth culture.  Because it touches on universal themes, fully operational when Jane Austen wrote Emma, the film withstands the test of time despite language (as if) and fashion trends (droopy drawers for skaters) that, as fads, have the average life span of a drosophila.Many viewers will approach Clueless with a certain amount of hostility.  Cher, the protagonist, played to perfection by Alicia Silverstone, is impossibly beautiful.  Worse still, her father, a gruff but charmingly protective Dan Hedaya, is beyond rich.  Even worse, Cher seems to live entirely on the surface of things, expressing her creativity through social meddling and wardrobe.  (The outfits worn by Cher, her friend Dionne, and others in their inner circle are reason enough to watch the film.)  How could we ever like such wretched, spoiled kids?Because, Clueless is a beautifully executed, gentle satire, not a broad farce or biting indictment.  Writer/Director Amy Heckerling, (who also did Fast Times At Ridgemont High - a lesser endeavor), understands and loves her characters, they are not stereotypes.  We like these kids because they are in on the joke, they know they're hothouse orchids.  Blatant examples include Murray, played by Donald Faison (now on Scrubs) a black uber-yuppie who learns his street patois from MTV, and Jeremy Sisto's Elton who has apparently hobbled his identity together from Rat Pack press photos.With the stage beautifully set, a comedy of manners begins, Cher manipulates people in order to serve her idea of the greater social good and learns a few lessons along the way.  No one is shot.  No helicopters appear.  Inept driving is featured, but there are no car chases.  Wonder of wonders, especially for a teen movie, there is no gratuitous sex.  Amy Heckerling is to be saluted for creating a film that relies on story, dialogue, detail, character, and acting to do the work.  Her success is complete.  Clueless uses SoCal youth culture as its milieu, not its point.

It was a big movie with a big heart. It's really hard not to fall in love with this movie.Loosely based on Jane Austen's ""Emma"" (LOOSELY), ""Clueless"" revolves around a ditzy rich girl name Cher, whose life consists mostly of cell phones, trips to the mall, a killer wardrobe, and tons of guys drooling over her. Her best friend is Dionne, who is just as superficial as Cher. One day, a new girl, Ty, comes to school and inspires a project for Cher. Project: Makeover! What begins as a selfish way to make Cher think she's doing something to help mankind, turns into a really sweet, funny film.Alicia Silverstone is wonderful in this movie, and sadly has not found any good roles since. A shame, since she is genuinly a great actress. This is also where Brittany Murphy got her big start, as the girl in desperate need of a makeover.

This woman cannot absolutely direct. Watching Clueless, I feel like I was back in my high school days where I saw more fake people than anywhere else. And in Clueless, they are like...everywhere. Boy, there is so much to dislike about the movie and nothing to like. At my happiest, I just want Stanley Kowalski to leap out and destroy everybody and everything in his path. Why not get Henry out of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and mesh him with the other odious characters? Thirteen years after its release, Clueless is a seriously outdated film with very bad fashion sense; hardly anything of the clothes resembles much of the early 90's but rather more of pre-dated 80's. In a perspective, when it comes to the subplot, Clueless seems to have influenced Pumpkin, and then the latter goes into a different direction. There are too many subplots going on in Clueless that the director does the ""hot potato"" thing as if she is clueless where she wants the film go to.

The film, which is loosely based on Jane Austen's &quot;Emma&quot;, is about rich girl Cher(wonderfully played by Alicia Silverstone)who sets out to help relationships in her friends' lives and whoever else. The reason is to hide the fact that she herself is lonely. She doesn't have that special someone. The film was stylishly and sharply directed by veteran director Amy Heckerling. She also did &quot;National Lampoon's European Vacation&quot;, &quot;Fast Times At Ridgemont High&quot;, and &quot;Look Who's Talking&quot;. The writing is quick, hip, clever, sharp, and funny. The young actors are all very good and deliver the lines the way they should be delivered. A good cast of young actors. Brittany Murphy, as the fashion victim Silverstone makes over, is a real stand out. Veteran character actor Dan Hedaya plays Alicia's gruff, but well meaning, father. The movie is very colorful. The actors seemed to really take hold of their roles and just have fun with it. It really comes across on screen. The movie makes fun of all the sayings and style of the time, but it's never vulgar or in your face. It plays it with sweet charm. A running joke through the film is that characters are named after music stars. Cher, Dionne, Elton. You get the picture. Stacey Dash, as Dionne, is a real find. Talk about gorgeous!. The movie turned into a surprise hit, both critical and box office wise. It spawned a pretty forgettable T.V. series.

""Clueless"" is so much more than your typical spoiled kids in high school routine which has been tirelessly done.  It contains standout characters with distinct personalities.  It also took a chance by playing down the sex aspect.  So many teenage movies are simply about guys trying to get into girls' pants by any means necessary.

A good case could be made for ""Clueless"", a movie that does as much to encapsulate the age of Britney-era M-TV as, well, ""Pulp Fiction"" encapsulated the culture of 'ironic', grunge-era M-TV. Or you could compare it with the Heckerling-directed but Crowe-scripted ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" as a study in contrasts.  ""Clueless"" is surely Heckerling's own darling child, a triumph of writing and direction that is obviously derived from Jane Austen's ""Emma"" without being derivative in any bad sense of the word.  Shot in sassy, lollipop colors by Dick Pope, the film exudes an impossible sense of cheer as it navigates the social misfortunes and triumphs of our giddy heroine, Cher, played by Alicia Silverstone with a comic oomph that ensures her a place in film history regardless of how many flops she suffered since.  For all of its of-the-moment trendiness (and though I realize the film is, as a certain demographic judges these things, ""old"" already, I have to give it snaps for maintaining its youthful feel) ""Clueless"" feels like some classic comedy of the '30s or '40s powdered up with Calvin Klein outfits and a pop soundtrack.  It treats its sexual and social themes gently, with a classiness that hasn't been matched by even the best subsequent teen comedies.  That's significant considering almost every teen comedy since has benefited from the format ""Clueless"" laid out.  Its sweetly satiric tone, jazzy pace, and vivid colors can be seen in films as diverse as ""Legally Blonde"", ""Josie and the Pussycats"", and ""Bring It On"".  Even neo-teen raunch flicks like ""American Pie"" probably owe their comparative sensitivity to ""Clueless"".  It proved that the teen demographic would appreciate a film with style.

386661,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,6303853102,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 1]","`Clueless' is probably the equivalent of `The Breakfast Club' for the 90's generation.  I went to school with these kids; sadly...I was one of these kids.  `Clueless' is also one of the smartest comedies to come out in the 90's for it capitalized on everything that made teenagers of that era funny and stupid.  The 90's was a much easier time.  Now we have films like `thirteen' (probably the best film to come out in 2003) to describe life as a teenager...life today is just so much darker than I remember it growing up.So `Clueless' is a modern adaptation of Jane Austen's novel `Emma' and it revolves around Cher (Silverstone) who is popular and pretty and completely self centered and spoiled.  She hangs out with the equally spoiled (and equally rich) Dionna (Dash) and Amber (Donovan).  When Cher's step brother Josh (Rudd) comes to stay with her and her father she tries to convince him that she's not the spoiled selfish brat he accuses her of being.  In an attempt to do this she decides to help ease the new girl Tai (Murphy) into popularity by giving her a makeover and hooking her up with popular boy Elton (Sisto).What makes this movie so enjoyable is the innocent charm Silverstone oozes all over the screen.  She is a complete star here...so much so that it shock and upsets me that after this film she just disappeared.  In fact the only actor in this film that actually moved on the stardom was Brittany Murphy, and she was the one I least expected (well not least, but she was more like number four on my list of assumed breakouts).  Funny and witty and perfectly cast, `Clueless' is sure to entertain all who watch it no matter what year it is.  Sure, if you grew up in the 90's it'll help.  I'm sure that my kids will feel about `Clueless' the same way I feel about `The Breakfast Club' but like I always say...""to each his own.""",5,Defining a generation?,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,1850,"['Clueless', 'probably', 'equivalent', 'Breakfast', 'Club', '90', 'generation', 'went', 'school', 'kids', 'sadly', 'was', 'one', 'kids', 'Clueless', 'also', 'one', 'smartest', 'comedies', 'come', 'out', '90', 'capitalized', 'everything', 'made', 'teenagers', 'era', 'funny', 'stupid', '90', 'was', 'much', 'easier', 'time', 'Now', 'have', 'films', 'thirteen', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'come', 'out', '2003', 'describe', 'life', 'teenager', 'life', 'today', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'darker', 'remember', 'growing', 'up.So', 'Clueless', 'modern', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'Emma', 'Cher', 'Silverstone', 'who', 'popular', 'pretty', 'completely', 'self', 'centered', 'spoiled', 'out', 'equally', 'spoiled', 'equally', 'rich', 'Dionna', 'Dash', 'Amber', 'Donovan', 'When', 'Cher', 'step', 'brother', 'Josh', 'Rudd', 'stay', 'father', 'convince', 'not', 'spoiled', 'selfish', 'brat', 'being', 'attempt', 'do', 'help', 'ease', 'new', 'girl', 'Tai', 'Murphy', 'popularity', 'giving', 'makeover', 'hooking', 'up', 'popular', 'boy', 'Elton', 'Sisto', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'innocent', 'charm', 'Silverstone', 'screen', 'complete', 'star', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'shock', 'upsets', 'film', 'just', 'disappeared', 'fact', 'only', 'actor', 'film', 'actually', 'moved', 'stardom', 'was', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'was', 'one', 'least', 'expected', 'well', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'more', 'number', 'four', 'list', 'assumed', 'breakouts', 'Funny', 'witty', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Clueless', 'sure', 'entertain', 'who', 'watch', 'matter', 'what', 'year', 'Sure', 'grew', 'up', '90', ""'ll"", 'help', ""'m"", 'sure', 'kids', 'will', 'feel', 'Clueless', 'same', 'way', 'feel', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'always', 'say', 'own']",Clueless VHS

""Emma Woodhouse"" is named Cher Horowitz(a bubbly and scintillating Alicia Silverstone), the daughter of a wealthy, widowered litigator (Dan Hedaya) whose wife died in ""a fluke accident during a routine liposuction"" when Cher was a baby, who has since remarried and divorced, giving Cher an intellectually and socially conscious ex-stepbrother named Josh(Paul Rudd), who criticizes the 16-year-old princess' lack of depth and drive.We see Cher's daily routine where she uses state-of-the-art technology to coordinate her school wardrobe, fusses at her only surviving parent about sticking to the diet his doctor prescribed for him, meets up with her best friend Dionne(Stacey Dash) for a ride to school in the SUV her father got for her even though she doesn't have a drivers' license, and deal with an annoying creep once she arrives at Bronson Alcott High School where she reigns as the Queen Bee.One Report Card Day finds Cher at odds over her grades with her teachers, Mr. Hall (the talentedly comedic Wallace Shawn), and Miss Geist(Twink Caplan), who give her the grades she earns based largely on her ineptitude with class assignments. But Cher learned from her father, who argues for a living how to argue her way to top grades, and we learn how skewered certain values of certain upper-class families are when Mel Horowitz praises his daughter for such behavior.Others in Cher's crowd include russet-haired Amber Mariens( Elisa Donovan), a ""frienemy"" of Cher and Dionne who competes with the two over popularity, boys, and fashion with a visibly fake personality, Dionne's boyfriend Murray (Donald Faison)with whom Dionne is in a tempestuous relationship,Murray's friend Lawrence (Sean Holland),the skateboarding stoner, Travis( Brecken Meyer), the BMOC, Elton(the charismatic Jeremy Sisto)whose father is a rock concert promoter(reminiscent of the fact that there was a character named Elton in Jane Austen's original story, but here, it is presumed he was named for singer, Elton John),and the Asian American beauty, Summer(Nicole Bilderback).Aida Linares and Julie Brown have comic turns as the Horowitz' maid, Lucy, and Cher's gym teacher, Ms Stoeger. Susan Mohun is Josh's girlfriend, Heather.During gym class, a new student named Tai Frasier(the late Brittany Murphy, who hit all the right notes with great comic timing and vulnerability) is introduced, and Cher decides to take the dowdy-looking newcomer--the ""Harriet Smith"" of Jane Austen's story-- under her wing, accompanied by an initially reluctant Dionne.Tai is soon well incorporated into Cher's world of make-overs, midriffs and matchmaking, but Josh admonishes Cher for overcompensating for her own motherlessness by ""acting out"" on Tai as if she were her ""Barbie doll"".We are exposed to the reckless and dangerous behavior of these upper class kids, watching them smoke pot, attend wild parties in which they destroy and steal property from the house in which they are guests, we see them get drunk, get sick due to their overindulgences,and cutting class in school to go to the mall as a diversion when matchmaker Cher attempts to hook up Elton and Tai, and Tai grieves over Elton's rejection(Remember, Cher still expects her teachers to give her top grades despite all this).After Elton tries to come on to Cher while driving her home after a party in Malibu, her responds to her rebuff by deserting her in a dangerous location where she is mugged and has to call Josh for a ride home.As we wander further into this world of teens with bandaged noses due to recent rhinoplasties, a newcomer named Christian Stovitz(Justin Walker), whose divorced parents have joint custody of him, resulting in his alternating semesters between Chicago and Beverly Hills arrives, and Cher feels reason to loosen her self-imposed abstinance from dating High School guys,trying to get Christian to notice her while also trying to find a new boyfriend for Tai.On their first date, Josh, who joins Mel's legal team in helping him work on a casein the dining room of the mansion, also joins Mel in expressing his disapproval of the would-be Rat-Pack Reject. The now-classic ultimatum of a concerned father goes as follows: ""Anything happens to my daughter, I got a .45 and a shovel. I doubt anybody would miss you!""But Cher has fun on her night on the dance floor with the Billie Holiday-loving poser. Josh drops by to keep an eye on her and ends up dancing with a humiliated Tai to keep her involved in the social activity.After the party ends, Cher reveals her generous side by asking Josh to buy some take-out for those working with her father as they are en route home.We also see Cher invite Josh to come stay with her and her father to escape his unhappy home situation when his college campus is closed.Her main project throught this story is trying to bring Mr. Hall and Miss Geist together in the hope that romance will make them more indulgent in grading their students, which begins to work.But Cher's attempt to seduce Christian while her father is away on business( a topic you can bet Jane Austen never would have mentioned) fizzles, amid the discovery of his sexual orientation, she fails her driving test and cannot negotiate the results of that, and her relationship with Tai takes a raw turn when Tai surpasses her in popularity.After an epiphanic moment, Cher realizes she is missing out on her own chance for love, and spurred by Josh's view that she is a brat, decides to become a better person. On one day in particular, Cher and the rest of the school heed Miss Geist's call to get involved in charitable work, sponsoring various causes, and revealing wealthy Beverly Hills High Schoolers at their very best.We see the improvement of one acquaintance with obstacles to overcome in his life, which he does with the support of Cher and a reconciled Tai, we see Cher develop into a more caring individual than she already was, and we leave our friends enjoying a glorious wedding day with high hopes for their futures.",5,Life Among the Upscale Kids in America,1271894400,"04 22,

Didn't like the 1980s Brat Pack movies (including Molly Ringwald's), didn't like the 1990s movies (e.g., ""Never Been Kissed"", ""She's All That"", ""10 Things"").  Sitting through them was torture, so I never bothered with ""Clueless"" at the time it came out, thinking it was of the same ilk.  It so isn't.""Clueless"" is two steps above the other teen movies.  It doesn't make the mistake of taking high school too seriously as the others do; it pokes endless fun at the genre and teens in general.  At the same time, however, it has an element of affection which the funny parodies of teen films don't have.  It's a perfect combination; Amy Heckerling deserved that WGA nomination.Alicia Silverstone is hilarious as the well-meaning but clueless Cher, and Heckerling channels the funniest aspects of Austen's Emma to make Cher.  Her well-meaning generosity is coupled with just a little shallowness.  Heckerling also does a fantastic job of making Cher at once countercultural but even cooler because of it.  Her rant about boys who wear pants eighty sizes too big is great, and she manages to deliver an anti-drug message without being preachy.  Unlike recent movies like ""Knocked Up"" and ""Juno"", Heckerling, with earnest humor, has Cher make virginity cool - ""You see how picky I am about my shoes and they only go on my feet.""  I don't know how Heckerling pulled it off, but she does.Paul Rudd is adorable as the George Knightley (Josh) falling for Cher, and Brittany Snow and Breckin Meyer make the dopey Tai and skater Travis a fantastic pair.  Elisa Donovan's catty Amber, who manages to land Elton, is fantastic.My favorites after Silverstone are Stacey Dash and Donald Faison as Dionne and Murray and Dan Hedaya as Cher's father.  Dash and Faison are so hilarious on screen together; Murray's head shaving and their exchange about ""woman"" and ""Miz Dionne"" are laugh-out-loud good.  Dan Hedaya delivers on Hecklering's script; his comment to Christian (""I've got a .45 and a shovel.  I doubt anyone would miss you"") is delivered with all the grumpiness of Austen's Mr. Woodhouse.Again, though, the genius of this movie lies in Heckerling's script.  She makes a surprisingly close rendition of ""Emma"", despite the radically different setting, and manages to infuse it with both some of Austen's amusing look at the characters as well as modern humor.  (Dionne's hats are a riot.)

Pawl ""Dani""","[9, 11]","I was thirteen when ""Clueless"" was released in 1995, and was definitely part of the target audience director Amy Heckerling wanted to reach.  This was the ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" for the 1990s (which, incidentally, Heckerling also directed back in the early 1980s).Included in this film, were the cultural and generational trappings of adolescence (obsession with physical attraction, wearing the right brand names, having the right friends, etc.) that continue into post-adolescence and sometimes haunt us years after we graduate from high school and start a new chapter in life.  It is also very funny, which is a plus.  Though, much of the Southern California lingo is, perhaps, terribly dated--though, I could be mistaken, of course.  (e.g. ""Whatever,""  ""He is such a Baldwin,"" ""He's a friend of Dorothy"")  This is a whimsical look at the life of fifteen year old Cher Horowitz (played by the petulant, whining and very convincing Alicia Silverstone), a poor little rich girl with so much money she doesn't know what do with herself.  So, she spends the bulk of her allowance on clothes, accessories and more clothes!  I mean, this girl has enough clothes to start her own fashion boutique on Rodeo Drive!  In order for her to properly accessorize her ensembles, she relies on a special computer program that matches her outfits together for her.  Her best friend, Dionne (Stacey Dash), is also a poor little rich girl.  The reason they have bonded is, because, in the words of Cher, ""We were both named after famous people who now do infomercials.  And, we both know what it feels like for people to be jealous of us.""  Together, these two young women give us a glimpse into the life of extravagantly rich, incredibly spoiled teenage drama queens and how money can't buy you everything.""Clueless"" was actually based on ""Emma,"" the classic novel written by Jane Austen.  Though, Victorian England has been updated to Southern California in the mid-1990s and the horsedrawn carriages have been replaced with Jeeps and flashy sportscars, the message about finding your own happiness through becoming less elitist and more thoughtful still rings true.

Heckerling put her talents to work thirteen years later for the next generation of high schoolers, writing and directing this hilarious satire of life at Beverly Hills H.S.  Heckerling takes a different approach from ""Fast Times"", which found its comedy in the absurdity of reality, depicting situations into which teenagers really get themselves.  Here Heckerling's comedy mostly comes from mocking the superficiality of the high school ""in-crowd"".  While this is not the first time this has been done, few have ever done it with such blistering wit.  This film became the standard for a spate of 1990's high school flicks set on the west coast that borrowed many of its elements.The story focuses on Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone), who is the most popular girl at Beverly Hills H.S.  Cher seems to be a superficial airhead, but this belies her conniving and manipulative skills at getting what she wants.  Superficial yes, airhead no!  In a plot derived in part from Jane Austen's ""Emma"", Cher works behind the scenes to arrange love matches between various students.  She even orchestrates a relationship between two teachers to improve their moods so they don't grade so harshly.  Like Emma, she is a master of love for everyone but herself.Heckerling does a fantastic job of presenting what seems to be a cotton candy story with lightweight characters, but which really runs much deeper, revealing subtle truths about human nature.  Her direction of the fledgling cast is superb, milking every ounce of comedy out of each scene.Silverstone sparkles in the role, which is probably not far from a reality with which she is very familiar.  She actually attended Beverly Hills H.S. with co-star Breckin Meyer, although she didn't graduate due to career commitments (she received a G.E.D.).  This film catapulted her to teen prominence with two MTV movie awards and an American Comedy Award as funniest actress in a leading role.  She plays Cher with both arrogance and vulnerability, and her comic timing is impeccable.  She also has a knack for physical comedy, with a broad range of contorted facial expressions and amusing use of body language.  The rest of the teen cast is also great, especially Brittany Murphy as Tai and Breckin Meyer as Travis.  Dan Hedaya is also priceless as Cher's work obsessed attorney father.This film is easy to like.  It is a light and funny spoof, but it still has nuance.  I rated it an 8/10.

386683,A29QA79VLQGHY6,6303853102,Flipper Campbell,"[0, 0]","""Clueless"" looks smarter and smarter as the years go by. Amy Heckerling's delightfully cynical tale of worldly teens obsessed with designer clothes, utility vehicles and cell phones still rings true, down to the last fashionista.The new ""Whatever!"" edition on DVD is aptly named: The slanguage Heckerling invented for her Beverly Hills High kids survives a decade later, proving every bit as seminal as the pioneering work of Moon Unit Zappa.""Clueless,"" of course, was in the makeover business long before reality TV stormed popular culture. Heckerling's heroines delight in transforming a grunge-clad transfer student into a hot property. Reality stuck to the script as the chubby young actress, Brittany Murphy, eventually brushed past ""Clueless"" stunner Alicia Silverstone to become Hollywood's It Girl.Paramount doesn't shout about Murphy's supporting role in its marketing for the ""Clueless"" DVD. In the extra features, she just turns up as one of the gang paying tribute to Heckerling's film -- and the director's prescience. Silverstone, who won hearts and minds playing 90210 princess Cher, is the sole holdout, an absence that goes unexplained (and unpunished) in the extras.Despite the acclaim and affection for this loose update of Jane Austen's ""Emma,"" ""Clueless"" was always in need of a home-video makeover, dating back to the laserdisc days. The new single-disc edition replaces Par's bare-bones DVD release of 2003, which basically came without extras. There are minor improvements in the decent video and audio, and something was done about the so-last-century cover art.True to the film's spirit, six snappy new featurettes survey the ""Clueless"" phenomenon. ""We're History"" explores the pop-culture legacy; ""Creative Writing"" tells of Heckerling's trials in creating and selling the movie; ""Fashion 101"" dissects the vines; and so on. A cute bit shows how to play the movie's (PG-rated) ""suck and blow"" game.There are no deleted scenes and no commentary, unfortunately, but the featurette interviews with writer-director Heckerling and cinematographer Bill Pope (""The Matrix"") give fans a pretty good idea of what was what.",4,Clued in,1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,2140,"['Clueless', 'smarter', 'smarter', 'years', 'go', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'delightfully', 'cynical', 'tale', 'worldly', 'teens', 'obsessed', 'designer', 'clothes', 'utility', 'vehicles', 'cell', 'phones', 'still', 'true', 'down', 'last', 'fashionista.The', 'new', 'edition', 'DVD', 'aptly', 'named', 'slanguage', 'Heckerling', 'invented', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'High', 'kids', 'decade', 'later', 'proving', 'bit', 'as', 'seminal', 'pioneering', 'work', 'Moon', 'Unit', 'Zappa', 'Clueless', 'course', 'was', 'makeover', 'business', 'long', 'before', 'reality', 'TV', 'stormed', 'popular', 'culture', 'Heckerling', 'heroines', 'delight', 'transforming', 'grunge-clad', 'transfer', 'student', 'hot', 'property', 'Reality', 'stuck', 'script', 'chubby', 'young', 'actress', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'eventually', 'brushed', 'Clueless', 'stunner', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'become', 'Hollywood', 'Girl.Paramount', ""n't"", 'shout', 'Murphy', 'supporting', 'role', 'marketing', 'Clueless', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'just', 'up', 'one', 'gang', 'paying', 'tribute', 'Heckerling', 'film', 'director', 'prescience', 'Silverstone', 'who', 'won', 'hearts', 'minds', 'playing', '90210', 'princess', 'Cher', 'sole', 'holdout', 'absence', 'unexplained', 'unpunished', 'extras.Despite', 'acclaim', 'affection', 'loose', 'update', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Emma', 'Clueless', 'was', 'always', 'need', 'home-video', 'makeover', 'dating', 'back', 'laserdisc', 'days', 'new', 'single-disc', 'edition', 'replaces', 'Par', 'bare-bones', 'DVD', 'release', '2003', 'basically', 'came', 'extras', 'are', 'minor', 'improvements', 'decent', 'video', 'audio', 'something', 'was', 'done', 'so-last-century', 'cover', 'art.True', 'film', 'spirit', 'six', 'snappy', 'new', 'featurettes', 'survey', 'Clueless', 'phenomenon', ""'re"", 'History', 'pop-culture', 'legacy', 'Creative', 'Writing', 'tells', 'Heckerling', 'trials', 'creating', 'selling', 'movie', 'Fashion', '101', 'vines', 'so', 'cute', 'bit', 'how', 'play', 'movie', 'PG-rated', 'suck', 'blow', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'unfortunately', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'writer-director', 'Heckerling', 'cinematographer', 'Bill', 'Pope', 'Matrix', 'give', 'fans', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'what']",Clueless VHS

And although being young and impatient, I liked the movie. A few years later, I saw the movie again, and liked it even more. And just last week, I bought it! This hilarious movie is about a beautiful, popular, shopaholic girl named Cher Horowitz (played wonderfully by Alicia Silverstone), who lives in a mansion in Beverly Hills. She is basically the most popular girl in school along with her friend Dionne (Stacey Dash). Well, after gettting a C in her debate class from her boring, lifeless teacher, Mr. Hall (Wallace Shawn) she decides that she should make him happy in some way. So she sets him up with another teacher named Ms. Geist (Twink Caplan), and her matchamaking skills work, because both of the teachers fall in love. While being in a good ""Helping Out Everyone"" mood, she carries on her good will for the new girl at school Tai (Brittany Murphy), and gives her a very good makeover, and also tries to set Tai up with a guy at school named Elton. Cher thought her plan was working, but after the Val party, her opion changed. Elton was actually into her, not Tai, and he came on to Cher, but Cher told him to back off, and she got out of the car. While in the middle of nowhere, Cher gets held at gun point, and gets her purse stolen, and has to rely on her ex-stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd). Then Cher falls for the new guy at school named Christian, but then she finds out that he's gay (which to me is like ""CHER OPEN YOUR EYES!!! HOW COULD THIS GUY BE STRAIGHT?"") and there are clues throughout the movie that he is gay, like the movies he takes over to Cher's; Some Like it Hot and Sparticus (which Cher called Sparaticus). Tai ends up falling for Josh, and Cher finds out, and tells Tai that she dose't think they ""mesh well"" together and Tai gets mad at her. Well Cher actually finds out that she loves Josh. and that's why she couldn't stand to see him and Tai together. Cher feels so bad about everything she decides to give herslef a makeover, but not the physical kind, the makeover for her soul. So she volunteers for the Pismo Beach Relief fund and donates a ton of stuff. Her and Tai make up, Mr. Hall and Ms. Geist get married...the end.

Paul Rudd (The Object of My Affection) does a nice job as her step-brother.

Like, how dare you acclaim this film? Grrr. It saddens me to see a whole bunch of the teen population even waste their time over this abomination.  First of all, I just would like to say that I am a seventeen-year-old girl who thinks feminism is all about Joan of Arc, Marie Curie, Amelia Earhart, Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, the Bronte sisters, Florence Nightingale, and many more, who made huge individual differences in this world. Compared with Cher, the babe of Hollywood, the girl who can't even think of herself...need I say any more? This movie... is a nightmare. I don't even know why it grates on my nerves so much, but then again on second thought, perhaps it's because this nerve-wracking mess undermines female power. Now, basically, the teen population thinks female power is all about arguing your dimwitted teachers into giving you a higher grade, possess the oh-so-amazing ability to find soulmates for your lost friends, plagiarizing Shakespeare's work (and may I add that the teacher didn't even know who that poem was written by), using Daddy's credit card, not having the common sense to drive with a license, etcetera. Pathetic. The plot itself is boring, unstructured, delivers bad one-liners, and just plain irritating.  Is it just me, or did anyone else notice that before this mess was made, we had TERRIFIC teen movies, such as Dirty Dancing, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Adventures in Babysitting, etc, which made a huge splash? Now, after Clueless, we have Drive Me Crazy, She's All That, Idle Hands, Whatever it Takes, Drop Dead Gorgeous...I rest my case. I'm glad that I spoke out, and have had an emotional catharsis.

I thought that Alicia Silverstone was such an interesting actress and I liked how the movie included ""real life"" from a kid's perspective. Keep in mind, at the age of 12 my brain was not fully developed. I do not know how any adult can sit still long enough to watch the opening credits of this movie. It is absolutely nauseating and ridiculous from beginning to end. Frankly, I am also very offended by the scenes of the kids using and abusing recreational drugs at that party. I don't care if it's just a movie and I don't care if you think I am a prude, drugs are disgusting and should never be glamorized to children. I'm sorry that's just the way I feel. The only person I enjoyed in this movie was Julie Brown as the gym teacher, Ms. Stoeger. She was a hard pill to swallow but also a very clever supporting character, who I barely recognized. What this movie does not tell the viewer is that money and status and clothing and material possessions do not make you a better person. As a kid watching this I never knew that and I thought that Cher was such a lucky child to have everything that she did. As an adult, I see how sad and tragic and out-of-control her life really was. If you want to see a realistic presentation of teen life as it was and is and should be then I recommend getting any of the first 4 seasons of 90210. BTW, the actress who played Dionne, Stacey Dash is in her 40's! I'm not very surprised because she looked like she was pushing 28 or 29. Talk about being miscast.

The result is a sweet parody of contemporary trends and mores that never stoops to mean-spiritedness, even as it exaggerates and satirizes.  Alicia Silverstone sparkles as Cher, the high school student who tries to  finess everyone else's life while mis-managing her own; her performance is  by turns supremely funny, genuinely touching, and deceptively natural.  The  rest of the cast complements Silverstone perfectly: Paul Rudd is relaxed  and charming as Josh, as unaware of his true feelings as Cher is of hers;  Stacey Dash is witty and wry as Dionne, Cher's closest friend; and Dan  Hedaya (a fine actor too often cast in cold, unsympathetic roles) is warm  and knowing as Cher's crusty father whose bark hides a heart of gold.The  DVD transfer is fine, with good color balance and crisp sound.  There are  not as many extras as some viewers might like --- just two advertising  trailers, both of which contain footage of a deleted sequence (mentioning  &quot;big hair&quot;) that looks like it might have been fun, and should  have been included on the disc.

After the lame bare-bones first release, ""Clueless"" fans were owed something definitive, and instead we get this!The packaging is glossy and pretty, and there are a lot of featurettes that are a lot of fun.  Seeing the cast then and now is really a treat -- in SPITE of the fact that Silverstone declined to participate.  I don't know why she's chosen to distance herself from this movie, because it's the best one that she's ever been in and no one's going to forget that she did it, no matter what else she does.  But whatEVER.  (By the way -- the most interesting tidbit in the extras is that Alicia didn't mispronounce ""Hatians"" on purpose, for the character.  She herself actually didn't know how to pronounce the word!)Anyways, the reason I have to take off a star (I should really take off two, but I like the movie too much to do that.) is beause of everything we're NOT given:1) There are NO DELETED SCENES!!!  Come ON, Paramount!  What were you THINKING!  We KNOW there are deleted scenes beause we can see them in the trailers.  We know there are deleted scenes because we saw the movie in theaters and we remember the original cut.  And yet we get bupkis.2) Even more frustrating is the fact that in the featurettes, Amy Heckerling mentions that EVERYONE except Silverstone auditioned via videotape. . . . . . . SO WHERE ARE THE TAPES???  You can't just mention something that juicy and then not include it!!!  Grrrrrr.3) And to top it all off, there's NO COMMENTARY.  Not from Heckerling, not from any cast members, not from the producers -- nada.  Hell, I'd even listen to the Key Grip and Best Boy do a commentary -- I just want to learn more about this movie!!  I mean come on, it's not like any of these people are A-list actors with so much on their plates!  They could have spent two hours recording a damn commentary.  I want on-set anecdotes!  I want hidden tidbits!  This is one of very few movies whose commentary I was looking forward to, and I am VERY sorry to see that it doesn't exist.4) There are a bunch of freakin' PREVIEWS at the beginning of the movie that you can't skip past by hitting the menu button; you have to sit there and fast forward.

386719,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6303853102,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 4]","The first time I got the opportunity to see Clueless in 1995 it offered a highly satirical perspective of Jane Austen's Emma where dimness and immaturity framed the world of a spoiled teenage existence in the Beverly Hills.  The second time around with this film I received a more authentic impression that brought to mind the high school students from the MTV's reality show Laguna Beach.  Amy Heckerling displays her cinematic agility to incorporate classic literature with a contemporary real world perspective of spoiled brats into a light of satirical comedy and coming of age drama.For many teenagers life in high school is an intolerable experience due to constant popularity contests, peer rejection, peer pressure, and the ability of teens to project others perception on self, which often is negative.  On this bridge into adulthood many teens find themselves perplexed about their identity and existence, which is often worsened due to their unawareness of the world and self.  In the confusion of identity crisis and popularity contests many loose themselves and the ability to reassure themselves in their own ability to conceptualize.  Clueless enhances this moment from the perspective of the most popular girl, Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) through her extensive cerebral monologues.  These thoughts provide amusement and irony for the audience through self-reflective contemplation and understanding for how many teens might experience adolescence.With the help of a credit card Cher can afford the best and priciest designer outfits and accessories due to her father Mel (Dan Hedaya), a widowed high paid lawyer that only knows how to raise Cher by spoiling her.  Her social life surrounds shopping and hanging out with her friends at school, which is a heavy-duty job, as she must maintain her status at all times.  Through her popularity she has befriended Dionne (Stacey Dash), and as Cher puts it, ""She's my friend because we both know what it is to have people be jealous of us.""  Here Heckerling offers a notion of how the social hierarchy is created in high schools and other situations where teens accumulate.The vanity and narcissism might feel blown up out of proportion, but after having viewed an episode of Laguna Beach it feels a little more authentic.  Cher's reality perspective is extremely skewed, which brings to mind absent-mindedness and ignorance of the surrounding world.  For example, Cher does not have a driving license, but drives anyway.  When it comes to parking she simply says with convincing belief, ""Why learn to park when every place you go has a valet?""  What makes this extra amusing is Cher's eloquence and verbal dexterity, as the hollow content actually sounds good.  It brings to mind some of the legendary statements made by the French Royal Court in the time right before the French Revolution.  Yet, the audience cannot help to feel sorry for Cher when she finds herself in superficial predicaments, as her existence has been formed by a loving and overly providing father.Some of the struggles that Cher has to face include how to raise her C-minus grade point average to the project of helping a new student, Tai (Brittany Murphy), to fit into her social grouping.  She also falls in love with a new guy at school, and begins to discuss sex with her friends.  These and many other issues converge in the story of Cher who finds herself struggling with her own identity and existence while coming of age.  It is not unlike many teens in the world, but it is a unique story told out of Cher's viewpoint.  Heckerling cleverly depicts the importance of nurture, as Cher drifts into the final phase of adolescence and finally crosses the bridge into adulthood in a thoughtfully amusing tale of finding oneself.",4,A Thoughtfully Amusing Tale of Finding Oneself...,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,3773,"['first', 'time', 'got', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Clueless', '1995', 'offered', 'highly', 'satirical', 'perspective', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Emma', 'where', 'dimness', 'immaturity', 'framed', 'world', 'spoiled', 'teenage', 'existence', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'second', 'time', 'film', 'received', 'more', 'authentic', 'impression', 'brought', 'mind', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'MTV', 'reality', 'show', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'cinematic', 'agility', 'incorporate', 'classic', 'literature', 'contemporary', 'real', 'world', 'perspective', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'light', 'satirical', 'comedy', 'coming', 'age', 'drama.For', 'many', 'teenagers', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'intolerable', 'experience', 'due', 'constant', 'popularity', 'contests', 'peer', 'rejection', 'peer', 'pressure', 'ability', 'teens', 'project', 'others', 'perception', 'self', 'often', 'negative', 'bridge', 'adulthood', 'many', 'teens', 'find', 'perplexed', 'identity', 'existence', 'often', 'worsened', 'due', 'unawareness', 'world', 'self', 'confusion', 'identity', 'crisis', 'popularity', 'contests', 'many', 'loose', 'ability', 'reassure', 'own', 'ability', 'conceptualize', 'Clueless', 'moment', 'perspective', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'Cher', 'Horowitz', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'extensive', 'cerebral', 'monologues', 'thoughts', 'provide', 'amusement', 'irony', 'audience', 'self-reflective', 'contemplation', 'understanding', 'how', 'many', 'teens', 'might', 'experience', 'adolescence.With', 'help', 'credit', 'card', 'Cher', 'can', 'afford', 'best', 'priciest', 'designer', 'outfits', 'accessories', 'due', 'father', 'Mel', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'widowed', 'high', 'paid', 'lawyer', 'only', 'how', 'raise', 'Cher', 'spoiling', 'social', 'life', 'surrounds', 'shopping', 'hanging', 'out', 'friends', 'school', 'heavy-duty', 'job', 'must', 'maintain', 'status', 'times', 'popularity', 'befriended', 'Dionne', 'Stacey', 'Dash', 'Cher', 'friend', 'know', 'what', 'have', 'people', 'be', 'jealous', 'Here', 'Heckerling', 'notion', 'how', 'social', 'hierarchy', 'created', 'high', 'schools', 'other', 'situations', 'where', 'accumulate.The', 'vanity', 'narcissism', 'might', 'feel', 'blown', 'up', 'proportion', 'having', 'viewed', 'episode', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'little', 'more', 'authentic', 'Cher', 'reality', 'perspective', 'extremely', 'skewed', 'mind', 'absent-mindedness', 'ignorance', 'surrounding', 'world', 'example', 'Cher', 'not', 'have', 'driving', 'license', 'anyway', 'When', 'parking', 'simply', 'convincing', 'belief', 'Why', 'learn', 'park', 'when', 'place', 'go', 'valet', 'What', 'extra', 'amusing', 'Cher', 'eloquence', 'verbal', 'dexterity', 'hollow', 'content', 'actually', 'good', 'mind', 'legendary', 'statements', 'made', 'French', 'Royal', 'Court', 'time', 'right', 'French', 'Revolution', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Cher', 'when', 'superficial', 'predicaments', 'existence', 'been', 'formed', 'loving', 'overly', 'providing', 'father.Some', 'struggles', 'Cher', 'face', 'include', 'how', 'raise', 'C-minus', 'grade', 'point', 'average', 'project', 'helping', 'new', 'student', 'Tai', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'fit', 'social', 'grouping', 'also', 'love', 'new', 'guy', 'school', 'discuss', 'sex', 'friends', 'many', 'other', 'issues', 'converge', 'story', 'Cher', 'who', 'struggling', 'own', 'identity', 'existence', 'coming', 'age', 'not', 'many', 'teens', 'world', 'unique', 'story', 'told', 'Cher', 'viewpoint', 'Heckerling', 'cleverly', 'depicts', 'importance', 'nurture', 'Cher', 'final', 'phase', 'adolescence', 'finally', 'bridge', 'adulthood', 'thoughtfully', 'amusing', 'tale', 'finding']",Clueless VHS

I already owned this movie on VHS, but a movie like this is worth having in your DVD collection. Of course, the quality on DVD is better than VHS, but it's even better because it's ""anamorphic"" -- excellent quality than some ordinary, standard widescreen movie (because of that, this movie looks recently made than a 1995 movie). Moreover it has superb audio Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound! If you have 5.1 speakers, the scene with Dionne (Cher's best friend) accidently getting on the freeway is where the surround sound truly enhances the experience: you can hear all the cars and bikes driving by just as if you were in the car with Dionne, Cher, and Murray. (Speaking of which, that's one of my favorite scenes! It really did an excellent job capturing the fear of getting on the freeway. I mean, it's not too far-fetched; it could really happen with all the crazy drivers in LA! The truck, the bikers, the old lady giving the middle finger... hilarious. Anyhow...)I'm glad they gave this DVD a makeover instead of leaving with some instant VHS-DVD transfer with only a movie trailer. On this new edition, they have really enjoyable special features too.-----------------------------------------------------""The Class of '95 - A look at the cast, then and now"" (about 18 minutes long):- It's really cool being able to see how the cast looks like now! Christian (the gay guy) seemed like he gained some weight. Josh looked like he aged; he looked different, maybe because of the lighting or makeup off the set. Oh, in the DVD, it mentioned Dionne was 28 (that old?!) at the time when she did the movie! To me, she still looked young in the interviews. What was truly disappointing, though, was how Alicia, the main star of the movie, was not in the present interview! However, there is footage of her getting interviewed back in '95. I was also disappointed how there was absolutely no commentary! Having commentary for a DVD, especially if they say interesting things in it, is actually something I enjoy having. Those two reasons are pretty much why I'm giving this DVD a 4 star. Also, the main menu has a video background, which is nice, but the chapter selection are just plain stills. Anyway, continuing on with the other special features...""Creative Writing"" (about 10 minutes long)- how the movie got started.""Fashion 101"" (about 11 minutes long)- shows the fashion in the movie. It's so funny how this movie made fun of the baggy pants (which pretty much died now).""Language Arts"" (about 8 minutes long)- explains the vocabulary used on Clueless (eg: ""betty"" meant an attractive female.)""Suck 'N Blow: A Tutorial"" (about 3 minutes long)- pretty much shows how difficult that game was because the card was too heavy to suck for the actors.""Driver's Ed"" (about 4 minutes long)- talks about the Dionne freeway scene.""We're History""(about 9 minutes long)- pretty much the final thoughts from the cast.Teaser Trailer (about 2 minutes long)Theatrical Trailer(about 3 minutes long)-----------------------------------------------------They couldn't have found a better cast; Alicia as Cher was perfect and the rest are really likable too (well, except for Elton -- the movie did a good job making me hate him. And Brittany Murphy was also my second least favorite character (she really got the bitchy attitude down calling Cher ""A virgin who can't drive."")There's no dull moment in the movie at all. It's smooth transition throughout the movie. So many funny scenes (eg: Cher taking her driving test). The mood, cinematography, the soundtrack is all great. Believe it or not, I am a guy (straight) and I'm not ashamed to say ""Clueless"" is one of my favorite movies.

Like Emma, she is rich and lives with her single father (IIRC, her mother died during plastic surgery, but I may be wrong). Here she is only 15 and already has her own car (before she even has a license!) and spends most of her time with her best friend, Dionne (no book equivalent). The Mr. Knightley character is played by her ex step-brother, Josh, played by Paul Rudd. The movie loosely follows a lot of  Emma`s plotlines. Cher hooks up two of her teachers and from there gets it into her head to be a matchmaker. She decides to give this version's Harriet Smith, new girl Tai (Brittany Murphy), a makeover and to hook her up with Elton. She convinces Tai that her crush, stoner Travis, is no good. Things backfire for her when her matchmaking plans not only fail but Tai eclipses her as the most popular girl. She goes after Christian (Frank Churchill), and although he's not a cad like Frank in the book, he has other reasons for not going for Cher.Some people think Clueless is the best adaptation of Emma, but I'd have to disagree. I did quite enjoy it and even used to watch the TV spinoff...I was in grade school, okay! I blame this movie for popularizing Valley Girl speak throughout the country, but that's another story.  I really liked the characters of Cher and Josh and their sibling-esque rivalry that blossomed into love and a lot of the parallels with the book were funny, but this isn't one of my favorite movies or even adaptations. I found many of the characters just annoying and not charming at all. I also think this movie treated some inappropriate behaviors too lightly. Maybe I'm just too traditional, but all of the references to sex and pot smoking (Cher disapproves of Travis constantly being stoned but feels no qualms about occasionally smoking a joint at a party) made me a bit uncomfortable. Cher also seemed to think she was the last virgin left at her high school, and tried miserably to seduce Christian. Tai, despite being a ""loser"", oddly has had plenty of sexual experience. The characters were only 15 years old, for Christ's sake! I suppose stuff like this is more realistic (or even not realistic enough!) but part of the reason I watch period films is to escape from reality.

Written and directed by Amy Heckerling (&quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;; &quot;Look Who's Talking) spent a year in the lives of several teens at various high schools in Los Angeles to give the filmgoer a truly authentic look at life among the young social elites of Southern California.Alicia Silverstone (&quot;Excess Baggage&quot;; &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;) stars as Cher Horowitz, a young, hip teen residing with her lawyer father (Dan Hedaya) in Beverly Hills. Along with best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash of &quot;Mo' Money&quot;), the girls are the  doers of social good deeds at their high school. Whether it is trying to play matchmaker for two lonely teachers (playwright Wallace Shawn and Twink Caplan, who is also an executive producer of the film) or doing a serious make over for Tai (Brittany Murphy) a new, dowdy student from the east coast, Cher is the toast of the school among her peers.However, playing matchmaker for others has made Cher realized that she too needs to find someone special in her life.  Pestered by her ex-stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) in doping deeds that benefits others and not only herself, Cher discovers that what she truly needs is a spiritual makeover that will allow her to attain happiness and respect. Yet, she wonders why it bothers  her so much on what Josh is thinking? As the story progresses, we discover that opposites attract and Cher has realized how &quot;clueless&quot; she was while looking for Mr. Right.Wonderfully directed and casted,&quot;Clueless&quot; features some  memorable performance by Julie Brown (as Ms. Stoger, the physical education instructor), Donald Faison (as Dionne's  boyfriend Murray) and Justin Walker, as Christian Stovitz. Walker who plays his role with comedic sensibility is great and witty as the boy Cher has the hots for, although she has little knowledge about his background.&quot;Clueless&quot; is one of the best films released in the 1990's due to his smart use of popular lexicon, icons, and attitudes that can be attributed to most American teenagers. This is  Silverstone's greatest performance to date, seeing that most of her later works did not go well with critics or filmgoers. Although a television series based on the film was launched in  1997, it couldn't capture the charm, wit, and performances of this film. &quot;Clueless&quot; is a classic teenage film you can watch over and over again.

I've had it on my wishlist for ages (although I recently swapped it for the special edition, which doesn't look that ""special""), but everytime I've looked it up online, it's been quite expensive.I was very disappointed. This movie is so 1990s, it's almost embarrassing! I remember the 90s (about the only decade I do remember), and I also remember all the ""whatevers"" and ""losers"" COMPLETE with hand movements! No one would do that in public anymore! Eeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwww! And the fashion as well - oh my god, did we actually wear that stuff! And it was only 10 years ago as well!Hollywood & various other American TV shows portrayed American high schools really badly. It comes across as being very unrealistic most of the time. I didn't really watch Beverley Hills 90210 while I was growing up - I grew up with British TV shows, but also Clarissa Explains It All & Sabrina The Teenage Witch. I think with this film, if you originally saw it in the 90s, you'll LOVE it, as obviously most of the reviewers here do. Viewing it in 2005, shows it in a whole different light. An embarrassing light.All the characters are horribly OTT (and most you'll recognise from other teen movies/TV shows), Alicia Silverstone & Brittany Murphy being the worst offenders. Stacey Dash actually comes across as a natural. How awful did Brittany Murphy look?! Good lord, she's virtually unrecognisable, and not in a good way either. And Alicia really started to get on my nerves, with the constant hair tossing. Tie your hair back, or get it cut! And it was so glaringly obvious that Cher's love interest at one point was very much G.A.Y. How many more obvious references could she have been blind to?

On the surface,  the movie seems an homage to the materialistic snobbery of young America,  but peel through the beaded curtains of shopping bags and Valley  Girl-speak, and you'll find a light romantic comedy somewhere along the  lines of, well, &quot;Emma,&quot; the Jane Austen novel from which this  movie comes.This successful attempt to translate a classic into modern  context doubles as an effective satire of the superficial teen culture  generated on TV and in movies.  You don't take these guys too seriously and  because of that, the story is both fun and engaging.  Cher, the pretty  gum-popping, cell phone-toting heroine, loves clothes, boys, and her dad,  in about that order.  She manages everyone else's life just fine but is  clueless when it comes to her own.  Not only does she have to overcome  normal teenage struggles like a doting dad, difficult homework, and rocky  friendships, she's got to deal with matching her undergarments, dresses,  and shoes, failing her driver's test, and falling in love with her  ex-step-brother.  Tough life, eh?  But it's those little quirks along  Cher's inflated path to self-discovery that make this movie such a gem.  Her humorous approach and response to any situation immediately recalls  Austen's Emma.Critics can whine all they want about Alicia Silverstone,  but she delivers a standout performance as Cher, giving her both brains and  tenderness and giving us a character to care about.  Cher is at once  innocent, smart, sexy, compassionate, and mature.  Silverstone is so  convincing, she hasn't been able to escape her role.  The supporting cast  is excellent as well, especially Dan Hedeya as her overprotective yet  loving father.

It's true, of course, that the drug and sex elements would have no place in Austen's world, but the essential cluelessness of the initially snobbish, smarty-pants heroine has been retained, which clarifies why Austen thought the Emma character overall a heroine nobody except the author herself ""would much like."" Retained, too, is the heroine's essential innocence, which turns out to be her saving grace.What Heckerling also refuses to derail - and this is most important - is the persistent ironic wit which distinguishes the novel. Other versions of recent years fall victim to beautiful period costumes and become just relatively humorless, prettily photographed, largely empty Regency romances.

386782,AYVM2DODURDLE,6303853102,Veritas513,"[2, 2]",Cluless is a story about Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and her friends who together live a fairly empty and meaningless highschool life.  The journey takes a turn when Cher's college age former step-brother comes to stay with Cher and her father and gets Cher to start thinking about more than just herself.  A very humorous coming-of-age comedy where Cher learns about life and love.  Well acted and well written this is a surprisingly funny movie with lots of memorable one liners and scenes.  A somewhat unexpected romance and a cast of well-developed characters make this movie a good choice for those looking for a funny diversion.,4,Surprisingly Hip and Funny!,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,632,"['Cluless', 'story', 'Cher', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'friends', 'who', 'together', 'live', 'fairly', 'empty', 'meaningless', 'highschool', 'life', 'journey', 'turn', 'when', 'Cher', 'college', 'age', 'former', 'step-brother', 'stay', 'Cher', 'father', 'Cher', 'start', 'thinking', 'more', 'just', 'very', 'humorous', 'coming-of-age', 'comedy', 'where', 'Cher', 'life', 'love', 'Well', 'acted', 'well', 'written', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'movie', 'lots', 'memorable', 'one', 'liners', 'scenes', 'somewhat', 'unexpected', 'romance', 'cast', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'good', 'choice', 'looking', 'funny', 'diversion']",Clueless VHS
