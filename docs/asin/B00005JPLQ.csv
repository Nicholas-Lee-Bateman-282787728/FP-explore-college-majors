652427,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00005JPLQ,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 2]","Critics and moviegoers generally panned The Hills Have Eyes 2, and sadly for obvious reasons that I can understand. I didn't think it was a bad film as a whole, just not that great. Unfortunately this sequel trades the original's suspenseful and creepy atmosphere in favor of gung-ho shoot 'em action which results in an unintentionally goofy adventure that makes a person laugh more than provide scares. While the first film had a solid plot, this film's plot is full of holes and is incoherent.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The story takes place two years after the events of the Carter family tragedy back in New Mexico. A military team was sent in for a search and destroy mission of the area. Then the soldiers at the camp are killed. Then the story focuses on a team of badly trained soldiers (Soldiers who apparently have a complete lack of discipline, competence, and common sense) who after failing miserably at a training exercise are driven to the camp to deliver supplies, only to discover that no one is there.... or so they think. Then they unfortunately come to the conclusion that they are not alone and like the Carter family are being hunted down by cannibalistic mutants.MUSIC: The musical score is not as good as the first film's. It's adequate, but not that good.ACTION: The back of the box of this film says it's more gory than the first film. This is not the case. The first film is far more gory than its sequel. Not to say that this film isn't gory, because it still does a fairly good job at gore. Unfortunately, this film is more about straight up ""shoot the crap out of the bad guys"" action. This really isn't a good thing because the action stumbles and falls on its face, then flops like a fish desperately trying to make something out of it. Not all the shooting scenes are a joke, but a good portion of them are. I was also laughing because these soldiers were so bad in this film, and display the competence of a teen in an 80's slasher film; utterly stupid and a sitting duck just waiting to get picked off. They waste their ammo, accidentally shoot their CO, leave their weapons out in the open, wander off to places by themselves, rock climb near cave openings, whine and b**ch constantly, and their combat skills are pathetic to say the least.ACTING: These actors to put it bluntly; SUCKED. Only two of them actually seemed to know what they were doing while everyone else performed badly. The dialogue is a mess and like many horror films is laughably bad. Overall their performances are laughable.OVERALL: Rental at best. The first film is much better and it would be wise if you stuck with that one instead. This film isn't a total mess, but it just couldn't match its predecessor.THE GOOD: Some of the action scenes and the fact that this film is so bad it's funny.THE BAD: The cheesyness of the acting, the not-so-great music, no scares, and the gore is not as good as the first film's.",3,DISAPPOINTING SEQUEL TO THE GREAT FIRST FILM  6.5 OUT OF 10,1237939200,"03 25, 2009",2009,2915,"['Critics', 'moviegoers', 'generally', 'panned', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'sadly', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'can', 'understand', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'film', 'whole', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'Unfortunately', 'sequel', 'original', 'suspenseful', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'favor', 'gung-ho', 'shoot', 'action', 'results', 'unintentionally', 'goofy', 'adventure', 'person', 'more', 'provide', 'scares', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'solid', 'plot', 'film', 'plot', 'full', 'holes', 'incoherent.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'story', 'place', 'two', 'years', 'events', 'Carter', 'family', 'tragedy', 'back', 'New', 'Mexico', 'military', 'team', 'was', 'sent', 'search', 'destroy', 'mission', 'area', 'Then', 'soldiers', 'camp', 'are', 'killed', 'Then', 'story', 'team', 'badly', 'trained', 'soldiers', 'Soldiers', 'who', 'apparently', 'have', 'complete', 'lack', 'discipline', 'competence', 'common', 'sense', 'who', 'failing', 'miserably', 'training', 'exercise', 'are', 'driven', 'camp', 'deliver', 'supplies', 'only', 'discover', 'one', 'there', 'so', 'think', 'Then', 'unfortunately', 'come', 'conclusion', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'Carter', 'family', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'down', 'cannibalistic', 'mutants.MUSIC', 'musical', 'score', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'film', 'adequate', 'not', 'good.ACTION', 'back', 'box', 'film', 'more', 'gory', 'first', 'film', 'not', 'case', 'first', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'gory', 'sequel', 'Not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'gory', 'still', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'gore', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'more', 'straight', 'shoot', 'crap', 'bad', 'guys', 'action', 'really', ""n't"", 'good', 'thing', 'action', 'stumbles', 'face', 'then', 'fish', 'desperately', 'trying', 'make', 'something', 'Not', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'are', 'joke', 'good', 'portion', 'are', 'was', 'also', 'laughing', 'soldiers', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'film', 'display', 'competence', 'teen', '80', 'slasher', 'film', 'utterly', 'stupid', 'sitting', 'duck', 'just', 'waiting', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'waste', 'ammo', 'accidentally', 'shoot', 'CO', 'leave', 'weapons', 'out', 'open', 'wander', 'off', 'places', 'rock', 'climb', 'cave', 'openings', 'whine', 'b**ch', 'constantly', 'combat', 'skills', 'are', 'pathetic', 'say', 'least.ACTING', 'actors', 'put', 'bluntly', 'SUCKED', 'Only', 'two', 'actually', 'seemed', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'everyone', 'else', 'performed', 'badly', 'dialogue', 'mess', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'laughably', 'bad', 'Overall', 'performances', 'are', 'laughable.OVERALL', 'Rental', 'best', 'first', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'wise', 'stuck', 'one', 'instead', 'film', ""n't"", 'total', 'mess', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'match', 'predecessor.THE', 'GOOD', 'action', 'scenes', 'fact', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'funny.THE', 'BAD', 'cheesyness', 'acting', 'not-so-great', 'music', 'scares', 'gore', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'film']",The Hills Have Eyes 2 Unrated Edition

652429,A3GI6DS6I474K8,B00005JPLQ,"Alan Draven ""Dark Fiction Author""","[40, 52]","A group of National Guard rookies is sent to assist some scientists for an undisclosed project at a remote location in the desert. They soon find themselves stalked by a group of vicious mutants.Let's make one thing clear, this isn't a good movie, folks. It has none of the gusto, cool cinematography, stylish directing, and well-written screenplay of last year's remake of the original. Where the remake by Alexandre Aja actually surpassed Wes Craven's original, this sequel is totally uninspired. Once again, an interesting premise (albeit overly used in the past; Aliens, Resident Evil, etc) completely wasted on a bad script. The actors weren't very good either, for the most part. Save for three characters, I didn't give a damn about the group of soldiers (they're actually National Guardsmen). The directing was average, no pizzazz, no flashy camera tricks. The movie was predictable and didn't bring anything new to the genre. The suspense element was reduced to nil. The mutants were all huge brutes and pretty much resembled one another as opposed to the different personalities of the ones in the first film.The only thing this movie had going for it was a handful of clever and inventive kills. The gore was minimal and the violence level was average; nothing we hadn't seen before. Skip it in theatres and wait for the DVD if you're morbidly curious. Go rent (or buy) the first one instead. Horror sequels are almost always bad and the recent ones (Ring 2, Grudge 2, Saw 3, Texas Chainsaw: The Beginning) were all sub par. I'm hoping they won't go for a third Hills movie after this one because it's bound to flat line at the box-office.",1,These Hills are flat...,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,1650,"['group', 'National', 'Guard', 'sent', 'assist', 'scientists', 'undisclosed', 'project', 'remote', 'location', 'desert', 'soon', 'find', 'stalked', 'group', 'vicious', 'mutants.Let', 'make', 'one', 'thing', 'clear', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'folks', 'none', 'gusto', 'cool', 'cinematography', 'stylish', 'directing', 'well-written', 'screenplay', 'last', 'year', 'remake', 'original', 'Where', 'remake', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'actually', 'surpassed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'original', 'sequel', 'totally', 'uninspired', 'Once', 'again', 'interesting', 'premise', 'overly', 'used', 'past', 'Aliens', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'etc', 'completely', 'wasted', 'bad', 'script', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'Save', 'three', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'group', 'soldiers', ""'re"", 'actually', 'National', 'Guardsmen', 'directing', 'was', 'average', 'pizzazz', 'flashy', 'camera', 'tricks', 'movie', 'was', 'predictable', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'genre', 'suspense', 'element', 'was', 'reduced', 'nil', 'mutants', 'were', 'huge', 'brutes', 'pretty', 'much', 'resembled', 'one', 'opposed', 'different', 'personalities', 'ones', 'first', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'had', 'going', 'was', 'handful', 'clever', 'inventive', 'kills', 'gore', 'was', 'minimal', 'violence', 'level', 'was', 'average', 'nothing', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Skip', 'theatres', 'wait', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'morbidly', 'curious', 'Go', 'rent', 'buy', 'first', 'one', 'instead', 'Horror', 'sequels', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'bad', 'recent', 'ones', 'Ring', '2', 'Grudge', '2', 'Saw', '3', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Beginning', 'were', 'sub', 'par', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'third', 'Hills', 'movie', 'one', 'bound', 'flat', 'line', 'box-office']",The Hills Have Eyes 2 Unrated Edition

652431,A3I9NLAKW3L4WI,B00005JPLQ,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Being in the Army myself, I found many of the details concerning the National Guard (or Nasty Guard as active duty Soldiers call them) to be laughable in their inaccuracies.  That said, I found the movie to be enjoyable because it delivers on its premise: unprofessional and incompetent national guardsmen go up against some crazy mutants.  In that vein, it has many similarities to the movie Southern Comfort (just replace crazed mutants with backwood hicks).  Most importantly (at least for me), is that the production values were pretty high for a horror movie.  The cinematography was good, and the special effects much better then most horror movies.  To be sure, the acting won't be winning any awards, and the plot doesn't have any real turns or twists.  This movie reminds me of other recent ""horror"" movies like The Cave and Descent which, I think, actually are closer to the action/thriller genre then true horror.  This movie also gets points for being a good quality transfer to blu-ray.  To keep things in perspective just watch the Uwe Boll train-wreck ""House of the Dead"" for a movie that deserves 2 stars (House of the Dead 2 deserving 1 star).",4,There are worse ways to waste an hour and a half,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,1160,"['Being', 'Army', 'found', 'many', 'details', 'concerning', 'National', 'Guard', 'Nasty', 'Guard', 'active', 'duty', 'Soldiers', 'call', 'be', 'laughable', 'inaccuracies', 'said', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'premise', 'unprofessional', 'incompetent', 'national', 'guardsmen', 'go', 'up', 'crazy', 'mutants', 'vein', 'many', 'similarities', 'movie', 'Southern', 'Comfort', 'just', 'replace', 'crazed', 'mutants', 'backwood', 'hicks', 'Most', 'importantly', 'least', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'pretty', 'high', 'horror', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'was', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'be', 'sure', 'acting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'winning', 'awards', 'plot', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'turns', 'twists', 'movie', 'other', 'recent', 'horror', 'movies', 'Cave', 'Descent', 'think', 'actually', 'are', 'closer', 'action/thriller', 'genre', 'then', 'true', 'horror', 'movie', 'also', 'points', 'being', 'good', 'quality', 'transfer', 'blu-ray', 'keep', 'things', 'perspective', 'just', 'watch', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'train-wreck', 'House', 'Dead', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'House', 'Dead', '2', 'deserving', '1', 'star']",The Hills Have Eyes 2 Unrated Edition

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[2, 2]","A group of rookie soldiers head out to top secret government area, Sector 16, to bring supplies to a bunch of scientists who are out in the rocky desert conducting tests. When the soldiers arrive at the camp, the scientists are missing. Soon, they discover that the surrounding hills are infested with mutant cannibal killers bent on slaughtering anyone that comes their way.Simple story, but enough of a premise for me to enjoy this The Hills Have Eyes sequel. Sure, it wasn't as good as the first one, but we all knew the sequel was coming given this flick's predecessor's ending.While the mutants in the first one were just plain disturbing to look at, in this one they were downright ugly. Warts, misshaped body parts, skewed eyes, drool, bad teeth--they really upped the gross factor with the makeup and prosthetics this time.The army-based cast of characters are stereotypical, sure, but in these types of movies--I'd almost say a ""post-apocalyptic"" one albeit a localized apocalypse--army characters fill a need that regular Joe Blows don't. After all, it's always the army that's supposed to come to the frontlines in extreme circumstances. However--and granted I'm not a military man myself--I did find the army folks lacking in the areas of intelligence and overall combat skill. Yes, they weren't seasoned vets, but at the same time, you'd think they'd be better trained to handle formidable foes hand-to-hand if needed be.The dark tunnels and caverns in this flick added a level of spookiness that regular rooms or basements can't. No one likes being trapped in the dark even if it's the dark of your own living room. Get trapped in a foreign location not made of wood and drywall and you got a rough terrain for anyone to endure.Will they make a third one? I don't know as it's been awhile since this installment, however this fan of the franchise wouldn't mind another sequel, though I'd be more thrilled if it was in the vein of the first rather than the second.All in all, still an enjoyable late night flick, especially if you're into mutant terror.A.P.

The second attempt on THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2 is perhaps even worse than the first, save for the gory effects. It follows a group of the most untrained, annoying, and childish 'soldiers' the world has ever known as they investigate an abandoned research facility out in the deserts of New Mexico. As they soon find out, the lab was set up to find evidence of the rumored cannibal clan that was supposed to haunt the location, and more murder and mayhem ensues. THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2 is drowned in poorly drawn characters and dreadful dialog that has the audience cheering for each death. Anyone unfortunate enough to sit through the entire thing will at least be privileged to some excellent brain-splattering and gut-munching goodness, but the pain and suffering endured throughout the rest of the plot hardly seems worth it.

652446,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B00005JPLQ,Christopher Engel,"[1, 1]","First of all, understand that this was designed through and through to be nothing but a gigantic gorefest, a series of shocking scenes with ultraviolence and other disturbing (albeit a bit creative) things going on. It's scene after scene of extreme violence, splattering blood and organs, brains being smashed in with rocks or shot into pieces, dismemberments, impalements, torture, the whole nine yards. Not to mention the film opens in a way meant to put you exactly in the state of mind it wants you going into it with: A short sequence of a woman who was apparently forcibly captured, impregnated, and then imprisoned until she gave birth to one of their mutants while being tied up--you get a close-up of the blood-soaked mutant child as it forces its way out, and then, just as we think we're done with that scene, she is beheaded, apparently having outlived her usefulness. It's about as horrifying as witnessing an actual childbirth, really, but there's a less happy ending for the parents (well, at least one of them).There is really no substance to this film at all, so don't expect it. This is purely gorn, nothing else. In fact, almost all the protagonists (primarily the National Guard, who keep getting captured and making stunningly poor decisions as expected for a horror movie) are exactly what they are in real life as they are in the film. None of them are professional actors, they're real National Guard members, which I suppose saved the filmmakers a whole lot of time and effort and kept the budget to a bare minimum. Still, they fooled me the first time through, being pretty good as nothing more than an object that screams and explodes in blood. Sometimes people can't pull that kind of thing off, but these people pull it off pretty well without hamming it up too bad, so I give them all credit for that, considering none of them appear to have acted in anything before, and were chosen to save time on the whole National Guard plot.There's really not that much to be said here. Expect to see lots of heads being blown apart with bullets or rocks, people screaming, impalements, dismemberments, beheadings, torture scenes, rape (which is actually the tame part, as it's almost totally censored in either version), and a lot of National Guard soldiers being picked off one-by-one in a variety of ways. Plenty of variety and ultra-graphic violence and gore is here when it comes to how things die and/or suffer, so if that's all you care about like some of us tend to, then this should scratch that itch.One last note I'd like to point out is that the film sets itself up for a sequel in the final few seconds, which clearly never happened, but I will say that this particular sequence, even if it's only a few seconds long and after you think the movie's about to cut to black, is surprisingly stirring. I can't say anything without spoiling it, but just before the screen cuts to black, we get a few extra seconds of the same scene that's unfolding in the film, and the final shot might surprise you, as it not only is rather unsettling in its own right, but it immediately gives itself room for a sequel. Even without the sequel part, it's still a cool final shot I have to give credit toward.Bottom line: Want gorn, and don't care about substance? Well, this should be perfect. However, just note that there is virtually no difference between the theatrical and unrated versions, so one shouldn't even take that into account here. Nearly everything is totally identical with a few added frames that are totally meaningless unless you're deliberately looking for them. There's maybe two minutes of extra footage, at best, and none of it's that impressive. Don't expect an extended version or a significantly more violent version, because the unrated isn't it. But that doesn't take away the fact that it is indeed an extremely gory movie worth a watch or two for the audience into this kind of thing, like me.",4,"Pointless gore, but more shock value than the first",1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,3938,"['First', 'understand', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'nothing', 'gigantic', 'gorefest', 'series', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'ultraviolence', 'other', 'disturbing', 'bit', 'creative', 'things', 'going', 'scene', 'scene', 'extreme', 'violence', 'splattering', 'blood', 'organs', 'brains', 'being', 'smashed', 'rocks', 'shot', 'pieces', 'dismemberments', 'impalements', 'torture', 'whole', 'nine', 'yards', 'Not', 'mention', 'film', 'way', 'meant', 'put', 'exactly', 'state', 'mind', 'going', 'short', 'sequence', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'apparently', 'forcibly', 'captured', 'impregnated', 'then', 'imprisoned', 'gave', 'birth', 'one', 'mutants', 'being', 'tied', 'up', 'get', 'close-up', 'blood-soaked', 'mutant', 'child', 'way', 'then', 'just', 'think', ""'re"", 'done', 'scene', 'beheaded', 'apparently', 'having', 'outlived', 'usefulness', 'as', 'horrifying', 'witnessing', 'actual', 'childbirth', 'really', 'less', 'happy', 'ending', 'parents', 'well', 'least', 'one', 'really', 'substance', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'purely', 'gorn', 'nothing', 'else', 'fact', 'almost', 'protagonists', 'primarily', 'National', 'Guard', 'who', 'keep', 'getting', 'captured', 'making', 'stunningly', 'poor', 'decisions', 'expected', 'horror', 'movie', 'are', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'film', 'None', 'are', 'professional', 'actors', ""'re"", 'real', 'National', 'Guard', 'members', 'suppose', 'saved', 'filmmakers', 'whole', 'lot', 'time', 'effort', 'kept', 'budget', 'bare', 'minimum', 'Still', 'fooled', 'first', 'time', 'being', 'pretty', 'good', 'nothing', 'more', 'object', 'explodes', 'blood', 'Sometimes', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'kind', 'thing', 'people', 'pull', 'off', 'pretty', 'well', 'hamming', 'up', 'too', 'bad', 'give', 'credit', 'considering', 'none', 'appear', 'have', 'acted', 'anything', 'were', 'chosen', 'save', 'time', 'whole', 'National', 'Guard', 'really', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'here', 'Expect', 'see', 'lots', 'heads', 'being', 'blown', 'apart', 'bullets', 'rocks', 'people', 'screaming', 'impalements', 'dismemberments', 'beheadings', 'torture', 'scenes', 'rape', 'actually', 'tame', 'part', 'almost', 'totally', 'censored', 'version', 'lot', 'National', 'Guard', 'soldiers', 'being', 'picked', 'off', 'one-by-one', 'variety', 'ways', 'Plenty', 'variety', 'ultra-graphic', 'violence', 'gore', 'here', 'when', 'how', 'things', 'die', 'and/or', 'suffer', 'so', 'care', 'tend', 'then', 'should', 'scratch', 'itch.One', 'last', 'note', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'sets', 'up', 'sequel', 'final', 'few', 'seconds', 'clearly', 'never', 'happened', 'will', 'say', 'particular', 'sequence', 'even', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'long', 'think', 'movie', 'cut', 'black', 'surprisingly', 'stirring', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'spoiling', 'just', 'screen', 'cuts', 'black', 'get', 'few', 'extra', 'seconds', 'same', 'scene', 'unfolding', 'film', 'final', 'shot', 'might', 'surprise', 'not', 'only', 'rather', 'unsettling', 'own', 'right', 'immediately', 'room', 'sequel', 'Even', 'sequel', 'part', 'still', 'cool', 'final', 'shot', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'toward.Bottom', 'line', 'Want', 'gorn', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'substance', 'Well', 'should', 'be', 'perfect', 'However', 'just', 'note', 'virtually', 'difference', 'theatrical', 'unrated', 'versions', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'account', 'here', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'totally', 'identical', 'few', 'added', 'frames', 'are', 'totally', 'meaningless', ""'re"", 'deliberately', 'looking', 'maybe', 'two', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'best', 'none', 'impressive', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'extended', 'version', 'significantly', 'more', 'violent', 'version', 'unrated', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'fact', 'indeed', 'extremely', 'gory', 'movie', 'watch', 'two', 'audience', 'kind', 'thing']",The Hills Have Eyes 2 Unrated Edition

That time of year when a young cannibal mutant troglodyte's mind turns to thoughts of Love and, uh, mating. And mating. And eating human flesh, because a MUTANT'S GOTTA EAT! Did I mention mating?Newbie director Marty Weisz picks up, & sadly drops off, where edgy Frog director Alexandre Aja left off, happily dispensing with that film's style and creepy-crawly vibe and delivering 90 minutes of spelunking, evisceration, and skanky, nasty cannibal sex because, well, that's what you wanted to see, right?Things have been going pretty poorly in Iraq, & now we see why: our brave guys & girls in Today's Modern Army are a little handicapped. Did you know?---1) US troops now have to wear hideous pseudo-desert camo battle-dress togs that look like they're woven out of raw hemp that's gone a little green in the sun (check out those funk-adelic green armpits!). Where'd they get their outfits, the Army of Lilliput?2)When US soldiers see something scary, they get all freaked & say ""uhhm, guys, why are we goin' in the direction of the weird spooky noises?"" and stuff like that. Oh, and the girls scream, because that's military style, you know. That's just how Army chicks like, you know, get. Word.3)In the Army of One, if you wanna pull off a little rock-climbing retreat, & Sarge doesn't like it, guess what happens? Sarge had better just deal with it. Yeah, off you go. No marching around the square for you today. No problem. I mean, hey, it *is* a volunteer army, right?So now the US troops have to do their breaking training out in the irradiated deserts of the Southwest, where they go mano a mano against the cannibal sex-starved mutant threat! Boom Shaka-Laka! And they're a little, um, what's the word here, sketchily drawn.Whereas the Cannibals are---well, they're very much in the Zone. They're all about Be the Ball, you know? They're highly motivated.So initially: advantage Team Cannibal.Things go pretty much by the numbers at first: the good-natured mutants have a little game of Marco Polo with their new best friends the army guys, playing all manner of fun and amusing practical jokes, those crazy cards!: like, cutting climbing ropes sending the hapless rapeller hurtling to a rocky demise, slicing off your hand and then waving and wagging the bloody thing in your face while your stump paints the high desert, and picking guys off with the old pickaxe in the eyeball trick. Works every time.But things take a direr turn when these bad boys get bored and switch it up from Hide N Seek to their own irradiated version of Hide the Salaam. One chick grunt gets swiped, and faster than you can say ""will you still respect me in the morning?"" old Papa Hades is showing the new recruit a little tough love---mutant style!---and giving her a little Surge of his own. Is that a cruise missile in your pants or are you just happy to see me?Love hurts, & the Mutant Big Kahuna doesn't want to cuddle after, either. He doesn't call Army chick for days on end. He donkey punches the poor girl. And Army chick, having decided He Just Isn't all that Into Her, plans to call it splits as soon as her former Army buds show up with a little chordite & some small arms.Man, Gold-diggers on both sides!So the survivors head off into the rat warren of old mine shafts and military bunkers, with the battle plan so simple even a modern major General could figure it out: crash the Cannibal party, snatch the chick, get outta Dodge, with, no doubt, a quick side-trip to the local abortion clinic.Terminally retarded, ""Hills have Eyes 2"" is nonethelesws about a bazillion times better than Wes Craven's massively overrated, impressively lame, utterly scareless original. It's a pity Weisz wasted most of his runtime mucking about on the surface, given that he manages---albeit for a fleeting moment---to conjure up a sliver of shrill, nasty terror, as a blind [...].bespectacled mutant fumbles for its prey in the suffocating dark, pawing and snuffling about in a spasm of starved, imbecilic rage. It's nasty. It lasts a split-second. It provides a glimpse of what might have been.At the end of the day, ""Hills 2"" is like its mutant clan: ugly, impressively repulsive, but worth avoiding.

652449,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00005JPLQ,Dave. K,"[3, 4]","Going into The Hills Have Eyes 2 I heard all the terrible reviews, but I figured I would still give it a chance. I liked the original 77 version as well as 2006 remake. To be honest I even enjoyed Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes Part II for the simple fact it was so bad it was sort of enjoyable. Well the same cannot be said about The Hills Have Eyes 2 07.The Hills Have Eyes 2 is pretty much a complete waste; the script by Wes & Jonathan Craven is very weak filled with boring and clich&eacute;d characters. There were some decent ideas, but they just didn't seem to work. I understand film is a business and it's often about making money then artistic value. It seems very rare these days it's the other way around. It's quite obvious the script was rushed; it feels more like an early draft rather than the final shooting script.The characters lack any depth at all and odds are by the time the movie is over you won't even remember any of their names except for Napoleon played by Michael McMillian. The only reason you'll remember his name is because that name is kind of hard to forget.Director Martin Weisz fails at brining any tension or suspense; in fairness there is only so much you can put on him. He didn't exactly have a very good script to work with. But the scenes when the characters are on the hunt for the mutants totally falls flat with zero tension and it just drags on and on. With some editing while it would still lack tension at least it wouldn't drag.The kill scenes are boring as well; nothing about them stands out. Bottom line is we have seen this all before. The scenes in the cave could have worked. But like every other scene they fall flat The Hills Have Eyes 2 starts off well enough, but once we start getting to the middle everything just falls a part. The loss of Gregory Levasseur & Alexandre Aja really shows in this movie.The idea of killer mutants isn't a bad idea, but I just can't take it too serious. But both Craven and Aja in their respected films were able to bring a sense of dread and doom and made the mutants a little bit creepy. The mutants in The Hills Have Eyes 2 aren't scary in the least and they sure as hell aren't intimidating. They are just as boring as the National Guard characters.Gregory Levasseur and Alexandre Aja were able to make the characters in the remake interesting and sympathetic. They were likeable and you'll be able to root for them. Again the characters here are clich&eacute;d lack any depth and I highly doubt anyone will care when they got knocked off.As I stated before I understand filmmaking is a business, but couldn't there have been a little more time to work on the movie? This is one of those movies that after it ends and you are asked about it you can't really answer any questions. Nothing stands out and it's one of those flicks you watch and forget each scene after they happen.I have a lot of respect for Wes Craven as a filmmaker. Regardless if you think he's great, average or terrible the guy has done a lot for the horror genre. But The Hills Have Eyes 2 was nothing more than a cash in. While I understand that is the point to most sequels, but there really didn't seem to be much of an effort put in. Like I said the idea wasn't bad, but it was rushed and just didn't seem to have any care put into it.The Hills Have Eyes 2 runs at about 90-min and to be quite honest it feels a hell of a lot longer. I know that is a clich&eacute;d thing to say, but it's true. The pacing is just so slow and boring and things just seem to go on forever. Going into The Hills Have Eyes 2 I wasn't expecting a horror classic all I expected was a fairly decent movie. But all I got was a very poor and boring movie.Hopefully after this those hills cave in.",2,Very poor sequel,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,3743,"['Going', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'heard', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'figured', 'would', 'still', 'give', 'chance', 'liked', 'original', '77', 'version', 'as', 'well', '2006', 'remake', 'be', 'honest', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Part', 'II', 'simple', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'sort', 'enjoyable', 'Well', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', '07.The', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'pretty', 'much', 'complete', 'waste', 'script', 'Wes', 'Jonathan', 'Craven', 'very', 'weak', 'filled', 'boring', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'characters', 'were', 'decent', 'ideas', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'understand', 'film', 'business', 'often', 'making', 'money', 'then', 'artistic', 'value', 'very', 'rare', 'days', 'other', 'way', 'quite', 'obvious', 'script', 'was', 'rushed', 'more', 'early', 'draft', 'rather', 'final', 'shooting', 'script.The', 'characters', 'lack', 'depth', 'odds', 'are', 'time', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'names', 'Napoleon', 'played', 'Michael', 'McMillian', 'only', 'reason', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'name', 'name', 'kind', 'hard', 'forget.Director', 'Martin', 'Weisz', 'brining', 'tension', 'suspense', 'fairness', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'put', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'work', 'scenes', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'hunt', 'mutants', 'totally', 'flat', 'zero', 'tension', 'just', 'drags', 'editing', 'would', 'still', 'lack', 'tension', 'least', 'would', ""n't"", 'drag.The', 'kill', 'scenes', 'are', 'boring', 'as', 'well', 'nothing', 'out', 'Bottom', 'line', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'scenes', 'cave', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'other', 'scene', 'fall', 'flat', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'starts', 'off', 'well', 'enough', 'once', 'start', 'getting', 'middle', 'everything', 'just', 'part', 'loss', 'Gregory', 'Levasseur', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'really', 'movie.The', 'idea', 'killer', 'mutants', ""n't"", 'bad', 'idea', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'serious', 'Craven', 'Aja', 'respected', 'films', 'were', 'able', 'bring', 'sense', 'dread', 'doom', 'made', 'mutants', 'little', 'bit', 'creepy', 'mutants', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary', 'least', 'sure', 'hell', 'are', ""n't"", 'intimidating', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'boring', 'National', 'Guard', 'characters.Gregory', 'Levasseur', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'were', 'able', 'make', 'characters', 'remake', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'were', 'likeable', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'root', 'Again', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'lack', 'depth', 'highly', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'will', 'care', 'when', 'got', 'knocked', 'stated', 'understand', 'filmmaking', 'business', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'work', 'movie', 'one', 'movies', 'are', 'asked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'answer', 'questions', 'Nothing', 'out', 'one', 'flicks', 'watch', 'forget', 'scene', 'happen.I', 'have', 'lot', 'respect', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'filmmaker', 'Regardless', 'think', 'great', 'average', 'terrible', 'guy', 'done', 'lot', 'horror', 'genre', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'cash', 'understand', 'point', 'most', 'sequels', 'there', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'effort', 'put', 'said', 'idea', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', 'rushed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'care', 'put', 'it.The', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'runs', '90-min', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'hell', 'lot', 'longer', 'know', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'thing', 'say', 'true', 'pacing', 'just', 'so', 'slow', 'boring', 'things', 'just', 'seem', 'go', 'forever', 'Going', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'horror', 'classic', 'expected', 'was', 'fairly', 'decent', 'movie', 'got', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'boring', 'movie.Hopefully', 'hills', 'cave']",The Hills Have Eyes 2 Unrated Edition

The basic storyline is that a group of national guardsman stumble into the lair of the atomically mutated cannibals from the first film.I may be in the minority, but I really enjoyed this film.

652453,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,B00005JPLQ,D. Blankenship,"[1, 1]","I was setting in art class a few weeks ago talking movies with some of the kids; twelve year old kids.  This particular movie came up and I was assured by this little band of movie critics that this movie ""was cool to the extreme and awesome!""  Well now, if you ask my wife she will tell you that I quite often think and act like a twelve year old boy and in all honesty, perhaps she is right.  Anyway, I was at the video store choosing grown-up movies to watch and happened to see this one on the rack.  I thought...""Hey, this comes highly recommended by those who know, so why not?""  Now keep in mind that this is an ""Unrated"" film and it was recommended by children...okay.....!This film is apparently part two of a remake.  I am not a big fan of remakes nor am I a big fan of part one, two, three, four...and on and on.  I seldom, if ever, have seen where this can be pulled off with any artistic integrity or dignity.  I did not see the original of this movie nor did I see part I - or what ever and after watching this one I doubt if I will.This is the story of a group of rather green, undertrained and somewhat clueless National Guard Troops who are out in the middle of the nowhere who happen across a ""tribe"" of mutant cannibals who have taken to living underground.  These mutants are sort of supernatural in that it is pretty hard to kill them and they sort of blend in to their surroundings.  The National Guard folks are made up of men and two women.  This is very important to note, i.e. the women, as a big part of the story entails the fact that these mutant cannibals are wanting women to breed with so they can continue their bloodline...the seem to be running out of tribe members.This movie is filled with a goodly amount of blood, gore, dismemberment, slime, guts and various body parts that keep turning up here and there. The movie is packed with almost nonstop action and I will say right now that the special effects, especially the make-up of the mutants was absolutely stunning and was the high point of this film.  Other than that is was....well, pretty pathetic in ways and a more than a bit disturbing in others.To begin with, the producers were obviously trying to make an anti-war and anti-Bush statement.  This was and is fine with me on both counts.  I am pretty apolitical but was not overly fond of Bush and am certainly not overly fond of war having spent over twenty years in the military myself.  The problem comes in that the producers did a wretched job of trying to score their political points.  As far as I was concerned the movie missed it mark completely here and probably did more harm than good - it the eyes of the producers.The plot was overly simple but quite easy to follow.  Most of the actors in this film were actually National Guard members and not what you would call professional actors.  They actually did a pretty good job - all things considered.I will note that this movie did have one rape scene in it that went a bit beyond disturbing.  I suppose that it was meant to be the center piece of the movie, ""A fate worse than death,"" but as far as I am concerned, they could have and should have cut this whole sequence out - it added nothing to the story.I could go on and on over what I did not like about this particular movie, but many other reviewers have pretty well covered that aspect of the film.  There were though things I did like about this production.  I thought the make-up was great.  There were some great dismemberments and enough blood and gore to satisfy most folks.  I thought the two female members of the cast were extremely attractive and I enjoyed seeing them.That was about it.  I am giving this one three stars, not because it particularly deserves it, but I want to be fair and I can see how and why this film might appeal to some.

Annnnnd, the stage is set.  This makes me happy.  When the fat private with a lisp - nicknamed ""Spitter"" - realizes they have poor radio reception and says, ""It'th the hillth, Tharge,"" I know I'm going to enjoy the movie.Before this goes further, know the following: This is not a movie for fans of good cinema, with great acting, intelligent directing, or incredibly complex scripts.  This movie immediately enters the make-fun-of-the-bad-horror-movie territory, and stays until gory end.  The fact that most of the villains look like Sloth from the Goonies is only icing on the cake.Anyway, the soldiers are woefully unprepared and sufficiently ignorant to make it a fun ride.  To chronicle this group of sad sack's screw ups would be hopeless.  Needless to say, it's SNAFU and they're about to get FUBAR.  One private attempts CPR on fellow breathing soldier.  Looks like the medic needs training.  All the soldiers have live ammo for this training mission.  The armorer definitely needs training.  One female was issued the Hooters version of the BDU undershirt.  Clearly the Central Issue Facility made a mistake.  Add that to the long hair, the women with gobs of makeup, and buck privates leaving their weapons lying around, and the whole squad needs refresher training.  It's safe to say the military aspects of this film are completely ridiculous and unrealistic.The kills and gore are particularly brutal, with blood galore the special effects aren't frugal.  To the aid station help arrives; quick decapitations, say your goodbyes.  M16 bullets fly, a Mexican guy fries, and the inbred die.  Disembowelments, buckets of blood; a suicide and a retarded stud.

652463,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JPLQ,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 4]","And see why the movie has received such a low rating. I will comment on two things: the poor script and the unrealistic portrayal of the military (you will see what I mean). As far as the script, I think John Craven (son) wrote it over-night and Wes did not review it. From the beginning, though a somewhat brutal mutant birth sequence, the film resembles something that would go straight to video. Sure a few heads get smashed, some limbs get chopped, and a gratuitous rape scene is included, but ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" doesn't have that level of brutality that made the first so fun. Plus most of the kills are quite cartoonish and campy.In interviews the actors talk about the relationships between their characters- but there is really nothing here more than the generic. None of the characters develop (more than they scream) and the whole subtlety of human interaction is washed away in an ocean of fake blood. While genre veteran Jeff KoberThe First Powermay be recognizable, the remaining stars are unknown model types garbed in army fatigues who spits out generic lines such as ""God doesn't know this place."" The acting chops of Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan are sorely missed here. To make things interesting, while our motley group of National Guardsmen and women are ill trained, idiotic in behavior and completely incompetent, the new breed of mutants are smart, quick and strong. However, this gets old quick unless the kills are cool or the plot is fun. We get neither. While it's always fun to see how many blows it takes to kill the final baddie in a horror film, the hike through these ""Hills"" is barely worth your time. The final battle between the hulking mutant Papa Hades (played by the same guy who played Pluto in last year's film) and remaining soldiers is once again inadvertently staged for more laughs than shocks.While video directors turned first-time film directors are always apt to disappoint (Martin Weisz, this time, who has more than 350 videos to his credit), I'm surprised at this mediocre effort given the writing credits of Wes Craven and son Jonathan. While the story hints at a government project harnessing the power of the mutant offspring in the A-bomb charred remains of New Mexico desert, it only tells enough to suggest yet another sequel or should we say Prequel (hopefully). Maybe this time around we will finally get the ""Hills"" trilogy that we were promised. Other then that ""The Hills have Eyes II"" is therefore convicted of that most heinous of cinematic sins- it is both unintelligent and uninteresting. It tortures the eyeballs without justifying the torture it puts us through.",2,You can quickly see what went wrong here...........,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,2637,"['see', 'why', 'movie', 'received', 'low', 'rating', 'will', 'comment', 'two', 'things', 'poor', 'script', 'unrealistic', 'portrayal', 'military', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'As', 'far', 'script', 'think', 'John', 'Craven', 'son', 'wrote', 'over-night', 'Wes', 'did', 'not', 'review', 'beginning', 'somewhat', 'brutal', 'mutant', 'birth', 'sequence', 'film', 'something', 'would', 'go', 'straight', 'video', 'Sure', 'few', 'heads', 'get', 'smashed', 'limbs', 'get', 'chopped', 'gratuitous', 'rape', 'scene', 'included', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', ""n't"", 'have', 'level', 'brutality', 'made', 'first', 'so', 'fun', 'most', 'kills', 'are', 'quite', 'cartoonish', 'campy.In', 'interviews', 'actors', 'talk', 'relationships', 'characters-', 'really', 'nothing', 'here', 'more', 'generic', 'None', 'characters', 'develop', 'more', 'scream', 'whole', 'subtlety', 'human', 'interaction', 'washed', 'away', 'ocean', 'fake', 'blood', 'genre', 'veteran', 'Jeff', 'KoberThe', 'First', 'Powermay', 'be', 'recognizable', 'remaining', 'stars', 'are', 'unknown', 'model', 'types', 'garbed', 'army', 'fatigues', 'who', 'out', 'generic', 'lines', 'such', 'God', ""n't"", 'know', 'place', 'acting', 'chops', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'are', 'sorely', 'missed', 'here', 'make', 'things', 'interesting', 'motley', 'group', 'National', 'Guardsmen', 'women', 'are', 'ill', 'trained', 'idiotic', 'behavior', 'completely', 'incompetent', 'new', 'breed', 'mutants', 'are', 'smart', 'quick', 'strong', 'However', 'old', 'quick', 'kills', 'are', 'cool', 'plot', 'fun', 'get', 'always', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'kill', 'final', 'baddie', 'horror', 'film', 'hike', 'Hills', 'barely', 'worth', 'time', 'final', 'battle', 'hulking', 'mutant', 'Papa', 'Hades', 'played', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Pluto', 'last', 'year', 'film', 'remaining', 'soldiers', 'once', 'again', 'inadvertently', 'staged', 'more', 'laughs', 'shocks.While', 'video', 'directors', 'turned', 'first-time', 'film', 'directors', 'are', 'always', 'apt', 'disappoint', 'Martin', 'Weisz', 'time', 'who', 'more', '350', 'videos', 'credit', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'mediocre', 'effort', 'given', 'writing', 'credits', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'son', 'Jonathan', 'story', 'hints', 'government', 'project', 'harnessing', 'power', 'mutant', 'offspring', 'A-bomb', 'charred', 'remains', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'only', 'enough', 'suggest', 'yet', 'sequel', 'should', 'say', 'Prequel', 'hopefully', 'Maybe', 'time', 'will', 'finally', 'get', 'Hills', 'trilogy', 'were', 'promised', 'Other', 'then', 'Hills', 'have', 'Eyes', 'II', 'therefore', 'convicted', 'most', 'heinous', 'cinematic', 'sins-', 'unintelligent', 'uninteresting', 'eyeballs', 'justifying', 'torture']",The Hills Have Eyes 2 Unrated Edition

652469,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JPLQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 2]","In a sequel the idea is usually not just to continue the story but to do the same thing, only different.  ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" is still set in the desert, still involves the nuclear family of mutant cannibals, and still has a group of victims with a propensity for doing stupid things that get them killed.  What is different is that instead of a more traditional nuclear family being the lambs led to the slaughter this time it is a group of National Guardsmen on a training exercise.  The other significant differences would be that this time around the victims know what is happening much earlier in the film and that a lot of it takes place while the brutal desert sun is up.  There is an interesting trend in recent horror films to actually try and scare the audience while characters are running around in bright light instead of always waiting until the sun goes down.I like the idea of introducing a bunch of soldiers with big guns into the mix, but ""The Hills Have Eyes 2,"" but because they are National Guards troops they end up falling apart at the seams pretty quickly.  I would not say that the makers of this film are trying to make a comment on the combat readiness of the Guard in a time when tens of thousands of them are serving on active duty in Iraq, but I would have preferred to see a more seasoned group of soldiers going up against the mutants, something more akin to ""Dog Soldiers"" or ""Predator,"" with a running fire fight through the hills.  They have guns and equipment, but apparently do not know what to do with them or how to best protect themselves, especially since their leader is one of the first to go down.  But you know this group is in trouble when it becomes clear that Amber Johnson (Jessica Stroup) and Missy Martinez (Daniella Alonso), are two of the best soldiers in the bunch.  When it comes to adding insult to injury, wait and see which guy lasts the longest.While this movie is generally disappointing, it does have several ""ewwww"" moments that actually got a response from me, starting with the opening sequence and ending with how Amber lets her fingers do the walking in the climax.  For what it is worth, this film makes the best use of a porta-potty of any horror film I can recall.  Wes Craven, who wrote and directed the original 1977 version of ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" wrote the screenplay for this one along with his son Jonathan (""The Outpost"").  ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" is a sequel to the 2006 remake ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" but I would not really say it is a remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes, Part 2.""  That last one had a group of bikers on a bus that breaks down in the desert (talk about a one step forward, two steps back idea).  Director Martin Weisz had made ""Rohtenburg"" the year before, with Kerri Russell as a grad student who becomes obsessed with the cannibal killer she is researching in Germany, and he does not even try to emulate everything Alexandre Aja came up with when he directed the remake.  If you saw that film, then you should probably check this one out, but any horror fan knows full well to always expect less from a sequel.",3,"This sequel to the remake has its moments, but no real momentum",1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,3109,"['sequel', 'idea', 'usually', 'not', 'just', 'continue', 'story', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'only', 'different', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'still', 'set', 'desert', 'still', 'nuclear', 'family', 'mutant', 'cannibals', 'still', 'group', 'victims', 'propensity', 'doing', 'stupid', 'things', 'get', 'killed', 'What', 'different', 'instead', 'more', 'traditional', 'nuclear', 'family', 'being', 'lambs', 'led', 'slaughter', 'time', 'group', 'National', 'Guardsmen', 'training', 'exercise', 'other', 'significant', 'differences', 'would', 'be', 'time', 'victims', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'much', 'earlier', 'film', 'lot', 'place', 'brutal', 'desert', 'sun', 'up', 'interesting', 'trend', 'recent', 'horror', 'films', 'actually', 'try', 'scare', 'audience', 'characters', 'are', 'running', 'around', 'bright', 'light', 'instead', 'always', 'waiting', 'sun', 'down.I', 'idea', 'introducing', 'bunch', 'soldiers', 'big', 'guns', 'mix', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'are', 'National', 'Guards', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'apart', 'seams', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'makers', 'film', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'comment', 'combat', 'readiness', 'Guard', 'time', 'when', 'tens', 'thousands', 'are', 'serving', 'active', 'duty', 'Iraq', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'more', 'seasoned', 'group', 'soldiers', 'going', 'up', 'mutants', 'something', 'more', 'akin', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'Predator', 'running', 'fire', 'fight', 'hills', 'have', 'guns', 'equipment', 'apparently', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'how', 'best', 'protect', 'especially', 'leader', 'one', 'first', 'go', 'down', 'know', 'group', 'trouble', 'when', 'clear', 'Amber', 'Johnson', 'Jessica', 'Stroup', 'Missy', 'Martinez', 'Daniella', 'Alonso', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'soldiers', 'bunch', 'When', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'wait', 'see', 'guy', 'longest.While', 'movie', 'generally', 'disappointing', 'have', 'several', 'ewwww', 'moments', 'actually', 'got', 'response', 'starting', 'opening', 'sequence', 'ending', 'how', 'Amber', 'fingers', 'do', 'walking', 'climax', 'what', 'worth', 'film', 'best', 'use', 'porta-potty', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'recall', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'original', '1977', 'version', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'one', 'along', 'son', 'Jonathan', 'Outpost', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'sequel', '2006', 'remake', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'would', 'not', 'really', 'say', 'remake', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Part', '2', 'last', 'one', 'had', 'group', 'bikers', 'bus', 'down', 'desert', 'talk', 'one', 'step', 'forward', 'two', 'steps', 'back', 'idea', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Weisz', 'had', 'made', 'Rohtenburg', 'year', 'Kerri', 'Russell', 'grad', 'student', 'who', 'obsessed', 'cannibal', 'killer', 'researching', 'Germany', 'not', 'even', 'try', 'emulate', 'everything', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'came', 'up', 'when', 'directed', 'remake', 'saw', 'film', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'horror', 'fan', 'full', 'well', 'always', 'expect', 'less', 'sequel']",The Hills Have Eyes 2 Unrated Edition

The movie does fly by and has alot of action and plenty of horror.  I think it is an improvement on the 2006 remake although not as gruesome.Written by both Wes Craven and his son Jonathon Craven i think they are trying to say something about the war in Iraq and possibly being unprepared.  Jim Hemphill of reeldotcom makes an interesting point ""Their script works on multiple allegorical levels, standing in not only for Iraq (with the mutants representing the insurgents), but Afghanistan. The implication is that, like the Taliban, the mutants are creations of our own government that have now turned against us, and part of the movie's impact grows out of the horror of this circumstance--a horror that goes deeper than expected from a conventional escapist thrill ride"".  He also points out Cravens Politcal Stands in The Last House on The Left with family values and People Under The Stairs and American's class divisions.The Director Martin Weisz also has harder material to work with than in other horror stories being in broad daylight most of the time and here unlike the 2006 remake our victims are National Guard troops with automatic weapons instead of an innocent family.I do have to say i was in an Army National Guard combat unit and women are not allowed in combat units, also I haven't seen many women that look like swimsuit models in the military.  The seargant and most of these troops act all hardcore however they all leave their weapons laying around anywhere and that would never happen.

Despite some nifty gore effects, the rest of the film features horrible acting (along with the fact we have to believe that these beautiful people are actually soldiers), predictable scares, a boring story (courtesy of Craven himself along with his son Jonathan), and uninspired direction.  What made the first re-make so good was Aja's pacing and atmosphere that anything could happen at anytime, and you just didn't know what to expect next if you'd never seen the original film in the first place.  As I said, this sequel throws everything good about the re-make out the window, and the end result is an unbelievably lame horror movie that should have been straight to DVD fodder instead.

652482,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005JPLQ,Only-A-Child,"[2, 5]","""The Hills Have Eyes II"" (2007) is a sequel to last year's big budget remake of Wes Craven's 1977 horror classic. The themes and the overall texture is much like Walter Hill's ""Southern Comfort"". In that parable a platoon of weekend warriors (Louisiana National Guardsmen) are separated from the other guard units during an exercise in rural Cajun country (a swampy bayou landscape similar to the SE Asian jungle). Ill equipped, leaderless, and generally dysfunctional; their blundering around just gets them stuck deeper in the bayous where they soon alienate the locals; with deadly consequences. Hill's film mirrored the U.S. military's involvement in Vietnam, a land of unfamiliar cultures from which the U.S. had great difficulty extracting itself.Craven's screenplay (written in 30 days with his son) for ""The Hills Have Eyes II"" updates and expands the political message of ""Southern Comfort"". This time the New Mexico desert mirrors the terrain of Iraq/Afganistan. Like those in Iraq, these Americans find themselves fighting a motivated foe on its home ground; and facing a culture they do not understand and to which they cannot relate. Craven takes the parallels even further as the foes are mutant legacies of early 1960's nuclear testing, just as many contend that the ""mad dog"" Iraq culture is the result of a century of western meddling. The mutants are a little over-the-top in appearance which seems unnecessary to the film but is not a fatal flaw.As in ""Southern Comfort"" the most competent men in the unit are the first casualties; and the least gung-ho must undergo a ""Straw Dogs"" style retrograde to his most primitive instincts in order to survive. There is a lot of gore but probably not enough for brain-dead ""Hostel"" fans; on whom the political subtext will be totally lost. And unlike most of these exercises in excess there is a genuine build up of suspense and tension. It's hard not to get into it as the frequent use of short focal length shots and out-of-the-frame audio is especially effective on the big screen with a state-of-the-art sound system.Neither ""Southern Comfort"" nor ""The Hills Have Eyes II"" could be regarded as fun films. They are mean films mirroring mean realities. But ""Hills"" at least has Jessica Stroup to look at; if she had been with those guys in the bayou they probably wouldn't have gotten in so much trouble.Then again, what do I know?

652485,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B00005JPLQ,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[2, 4]","First, let's clear up some confusion:1. The originalThe Hills Have Eyes, produced in 1977, is a terrific old slasher film. It was written and directed by Wes Craven, (in his heyday), and starred Susan Lanier.2. A sequel film is entitledThe Hills Have Eyes, Part 2, and was produced and written by Wes Craven in 1985. It starred Tamara Stafford.3. The third,The Hills Have Eyes (Unrated Edition), was produced in 2006 by Wes Craven, directed by Alexandre Aja, and starred Aaron Stanford.4. The fourth film, (the one I'm reviewing here),The Hills Have Eyes 2 (Unrated Edition), was produced in 2007, directed by Martin Weisz, and written by Wes Craven and Jonathan Craven. It stars Michael McMillian.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! (that is, if this movie can BE spoiled.)THE STORY: On a former A-bomb testing ground in the desert, a U.S. military research team gets wiped out by mutated genetic retards. A team of rookie soldiers is dispatched to investigate the disappearance of the research team and of course, they lose their communications, their transportation, and they begin to fall prey to the very same pseudo-monsters. The idea (from the retards' viewpoint) is to kill all the males and to maintain the female captives for breeding.The universal caveat with these nuclear films which always gives me a chuckle is that the radiation inevitably seems to produce very shrewd (but not very intelligent) violent creatures with great athletic ability, and these atomic hybrids always come in mega-size. But I do not despise the writers for this because these movies would be pretty boring if the victims had to face an army of moaning weaklings who were lying on their death-beds -- it's just an observation.Whether a film is produced either on a shoestring or a mega-budget, it still holds the prospect of being well-made -- this one is not well-made. There are scads of continuity problems with the film, but two glitches that wiped me out were really stupid ones:1. All the soldiers have the American flag shoulder patches sewn on backwards... the blue field is in the upper right-hand corner.2. Reference is repeatedly made to the rookie soldiers being in the ""U.S. National Guard."" There is no such thing as this -- National Guard elements come from the various states (e.g., ""Texas National Guard"") and so this sounded really dumb. The writers should have simply used regular U.S. soldiers in the script.Those sound like small issues but when they pile up at the rate which they did in this film, it takes away from whatever positive components that the movie might otherwise feature.And there were the anticipated hackneyed scenes as well: the arm-chopped-off squirting blood scene; the ammo-running-low dilemma; tons of violent rape; the body-parts storage room (Tobe Hooper generated the best of these in his 1974 cult classic:The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2-Disc Ultimate Edition)), and; the monster that you think is dead but he really isn't. In other words, there was little original thinking behind this film.The script is unusually bad. The level of profanity, which can be used to punctuate a film, simply became tiresome here. A typical example of bad writing occurs when a macerated victim crawls out of the tank of an active porta-john and a soldier refers to him as ""S***-man the Barbarian."" It wasn't all that humorous a moment. In fact there are redundant references to feces in this film which added little or nothing to either its scariness or its watchability.This film amounts to a sort of depraved version ofSouthern Comfortwhich is a little different genre and a far superior film. I gave the various freaks my own characterizations so I could keep them all straight:-- Billy Carter (as he presently looks)-- A really dirty Al Franken-- Lizard-tongue cauliflower man-- Leather-face reject-- Michael Chertoff look-alike-- Pseudo-Elephant Man (who was actually friendly in this film)-- A Young Senator Robert Byrd who was in urgent need of dental and barber work-- Mr. Cheeto-headThere were a couple more but they played minor roles and didn't last long during the conflict. The thing was, since they constituted a commune, one would have expected these freaks to work together a little more -- they were mostly very selfish loners, (especially with captured beautiful and shapely young gals.)This film is unrated, shot in color, has an aspect ration of 2.35:1, and runs for 89 minutes.In summary, the producers and director made a slasher film which exuded the same tired gimmicks. I realize that these low-budget slasher films are supposed to be tongue-in-cheek but that doesn't mean that they have to be crummy. I gave it two stars instead of one because the camera work and scenery were both very good and, of course, there are films which are much worse and I must reserve the one-star rating for those.Not

Which should probably tip you off that this movie is better than the awful, awful remake it follows. After all, the American public at large has an incredibly well-documented lack of taste, especially when it comes to horror films. (Just look at at the foreign horror flicks that get a theatrical release in America as opposed to those that don't; Darkness vs. [REC]; Haute Tension vs. Saint Ange; etc.) Yes, it's still deeply rooted in horror-movie clich&eacute; and character stupidity, and the score is one of the, shall we say, least inspiring I've heard recently, but compared to the mindless rah-rah-patriot crap in the 2006 movie that made such a mockery of the original, Wes Craven-directed 1975 film, this is Oscar material.Plot: two years after the events in the first film, an incompetent National Guard squad and their long-suffering sergeant (Snakes on a Plane's Flex Alexander) are sent to a very familiar stretch of land to deliver supplies to a scientific expedition (whom we saw getting slaughtered in the first couple of scenes). When they get there, the camp is deserted, but a weak distress call sends them off into the hills, and into a confrontation with the locals, a band of mutants who are the offspring of people trapped in the mines during the nuclear testing that went on there in the fifties.It's straight survival horror, with any message to be found in it so badly handled that it can be safely ignored. In that regard alone it towers over the 2006 remake. The characters, while most are not fully fleshed, are at least not paper-thin attempts at archetype. The situations they're put in are things that logically follow from what came before, rather than from shameless attempts at manipulating the audience. (Well, most of the time, anyway. There's that ""except the women. They'll keep 'em for breedin'."" part.) Yes, better than the 2006 movie. But still, couldn't you have done something even remotely original with the material? Ooh, army men in a haunted mine. Scary. (Note: yes, I do understand the difference between the army and the national guard, thanks. ""Army men"" is a generic reference to the toy soldiers we all played with as kids, and the sentence is meant to be read in an eight-year-old's voice.) That said, it's at least watchable, and mildly entertaining. And, most importantly, it's not an attempt, as I had feared it would be, to remake Craven's 1985 sequel. That alone earns it quite a few brownie points. But not enough to score it a recommendation. Watch it if you have nothing better to do, or if, for some reason I will never be able to fathom, you actually liked the first remake. **",2,"Still nowhere near Craven's flicks, but far better than the first remake.",1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,2817,"['Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'Martin', 'Weisz', '2007', 'Weisz', '60', 'Seconds', 'have', 'encountered', 'rather', 'virulent', 'hatred', 'good', 'portion', 'population', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'Which', 'should', 'probably', 'tip', 'off', 'movie', 'better', 'awful', 'awful', 'remake', 'American', 'public', 'large', 'incredibly', 'well-documented', 'lack', 'taste', 'especially', 'when', 'horror', 'films', 'Just', 'look', 'foreign', 'horror', 'flicks', 'get', 'theatrical', 'release', 'America', 'opposed', 'do', ""n't"", 'Darkness', '[', 'REC', ']', 'Haute', 'Tension', 'vs.', 'Saint', 'Ange', 'etc', 'Yes', 'still', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'horror-movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'character', 'stupidity', 'score', 'one', 'shall', 'say', 'least', 'inspiring', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'recently', 'compared', 'mindless', 'rah-rah-patriot', 'crap', '2006', 'movie', 'made', 'mockery', 'original', 'Wes', 'Craven-directed', '1975', 'film', 'Oscar', 'material.Plot', 'two', 'years', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'incompetent', 'National', 'Guard', 'squad', 'long-suffering', 'sergeant', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'Flex', 'Alexander', 'are', 'sent', 'very', 'familiar', 'stretch', 'land', 'deliver', 'supplies', 'scientific', 'expedition', 'whom', 'saw', 'getting', 'slaughtered', 'first', 'couple', 'scenes', 'When', 'get', 'there', 'camp', 'deserted', 'weak', 'distress', 'call', 'off', 'hills', 'confrontation', 'locals', 'band', 'mutants', 'who', 'are', 'offspring', 'people', 'trapped', 'mines', 'nuclear', 'testing', 'went', 'fifties.It', 'straight', 'survival', 'horror', 'message', 'be', 'found', 'so', 'badly', 'handled', 'can', 'be', 'safely', 'ignored', 'regard', 'alone', '2006', 'remake', 'characters', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'are', 'least', 'not', 'paper-thin', 'attempts', 'archetype', 'situations', ""'re"", 'put', 'are', 'things', 'logically', 'follow', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'rather', 'shameless', 'attempts', 'manipulating', 'audience', 'Well', 'most', 'time', 'anyway', 'women', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'breedin', 'part', 'Yes', 'better', '2006', 'movie', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'something', 'even', 'remotely', 'original', 'material', 'Ooh', 'army', 'men', 'haunted', 'mine', 'Scary', 'Note', 'yes', 'do', 'understand', 'difference', 'army', 'national', 'guard', 'thanks', 'Army', 'men', 'generic', 'reference', 'toy', 'soldiers', 'played', 'kids', 'sentence', 'meant', 'be', 'read', 'eight-year-old', 'voice', 'said', 'least', 'watchable', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'most', 'importantly', 'not', 'attempt', 'had', 'feared', 'would', 'be', 'remake', 'Craven', '1985', 'sequel', 'alone', 'quite', 'few', 'brownie', 'points', 'not', 'enough', 'score', 'recommendation', 'Watch', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'reason', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'fathom', 'actually', 'liked', 'first', 'remake', '**']",The Hills Have Eyes 2 Unrated Edition

Everything that made the first film triumphant is completely absent here. The movie begins with a group of National Guard rookies arriving in the same desert of the first film. Only this time they know there is a threat. Like the first movie they get killed one by one. Sure enough there is more gore and guts..... So what exactly is wrong with this movie? Well for starters there are no scares, there are no surprises. The whole movie feels formulaic. Whereas the first one kept you on the edge of your seat; here everything is pretty much predictable. And the funny thing is that you can tell the actors worked hard... but still the movie feels pretty mediocre. Another bad thing about this one is the rape scene, unlike the first movie were the rape scene never got to the real thing, here it's pretty explicit and way to long, that almost made me turn the movie off.

652507,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JPLQ,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[4, 6]","Typically, when a sequel to a successful horror film is green-lit less than one month after the release of the original (remake), it is pretty easy to be skeptical about the studio's motivations. Though Wes Craven, the creator of the original series, was involved, the real savior to The Hills Have Eyes 2 came from the hiring of German director Martin Weisz. Weisz's first film is the controversial feature Grimm Love which was, oddly enough, also about cannibalism. The Hills Have Eyes 2 is his follow-up and it is safe to say that unlike other directors, he did not fall into a sophomore slump.Last year marked the rebirth of the Hills Have Eyes franchise under the direction of French filmmaker Alexandre Aja. Though I was not a fan of the original, Aja displayed a keen eye for horrific visuals. This time out, series creator Wes Craven wrote the screenplay and while some of the dialogue is trite and the characters boneheaded, Weisz more than makes up for the screenplay's shortcomings with grisly action.The premise of The Hills Have Eyes 2 is to its original (remake) as Aliens was to its predecessor. As one might imagine, the ruthlessness of the action is surprisingly intense. This helped it surpass the Aja film, as it went right for the audience's guts, instead of letting them focus on its weaker story. The characters are typical horror film stock, but Weisz's gruesome death sequences more than make up for it.Speaking of graphic bloodletting, I am sure the studio had a hell of a time working with the MPAA on this picture. There is a very graphic birth at the beginning of the film, not to mention a body being folded in half and a nasty rape scene as icing on the cake. This is one of the most disgusting and repulsive horror films I have seen in years and it is damn entertaining. There were several moments where I was applauding Weisz's bravery. Even when a scene was heading towards predictability, Weisz would jumpstart the moment with a revolting and explicit display of carnage.The cinematography from Sam McCurdy helps Weisz's vision immensely. The characters in the Hills 2 end up in caves, and without McCurdy's understanding of how to light such a dark environment, the film would have looked grainy and lost much of its intensity. This familiar territory may cause some to recollect McCurdy's previous project, The Descent, another horror thriller involving cannibalistic creatures in caves.For the most part the fast paced editing reflected recent trends in horror films, but it was nice to see the rapid cuts let up every once in a while so that confusion didn't consistently reign. The editor, Kirk M. Morri, and director Weisz keep the gore on display, resisting where other filmmakers might make a cut, allowing the intensity and gruesomeness to ratchet up a notch.While this flesh-eating feast may not be everyone's platter of brains, those who loved the original or remake might consider chancing Weisz's experiment in extreme butchery. Gorehounds everywhere that can stomach anything save for a realistic plotline will revel in The Hills Have Eyes 2's bloody good time.- G.

Indeed, the training exercise in the beginning of the movie, in which the raw recruits trust an Afghan woman who is in actuality a suicide bomber, is reprised near the end, when the survivors are asked to trust a mysterious hilldweller who is attempting to lead them to safety.I am not saying the hillpeople-as-terrorists theme works, just that it appears to have been something in the mind of the filmmakers.  They do wind up simply going for the gore and thrills, which to me were fairly well-rendered in the abandoned caves below.Not worthy as a successor to the excellent 2006 remake, but not as bad as some of the reviewers seem to find it.

After sniffing around in the mines, wiring them for visuals and sound and some other pretty LED whatnot, someone found themselves in a world of hurt and went missing. Enter the ""military"" attachment sent into the desert to see what went awry - and enter the realm of ""easy pickings,"" where people with hatchets and knives have a better chance of winning than the pseudo-soldiers hanging around.After the first round of remakes on the Hills Have Eyes, I was actually impressed with the modernizations and with the gore and thought that the sequel might be a decent dose of - something. I heard the plot points of the movie, the words ""military"" flashing around and replacing ""lost drivers,"" and I thought this had a chance at some real zest. People trained with guns MUST be able to shoot better than the 4/15 average seen in parts of the 1st one, after all, and seeing a composed force would have to give people a better fighting chance than people kicking it in with their parents on a cross-country trip. That's what I thought, anyhow, and then I watched the movie.And what I saw was wretched, even as sequels go.There were so many bad things in this movie that its hard to pick a favorite. The acting was one of those, and I really don't have high expectations of those walking into the lions den. For those who are about to die, we salute you - these modern gladiators did anything but that as they haphazardly portrayed a group I wouldn't want rescuing me from a paperbag attack. By the middle of the movie I had actually forgotten they were supposed to be military; I kept thinking they were a ground of people more akin to being killed on ""when Good Hiking Goes Bad"" or something like that. The list of bad stuff - it just keeps going on and on. Really, it was that bad and had little in the way of redemption.Even some terrible deaths couldn't bring thing back from the brink of ""blah.""One thing I forgot about the first versus the second - the first had a great blueprint to redo and the second was a trial run of something that quickly lost traction.

652511,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JPLQ,trebe,"[0, 0]","Alexandre Aja and Greg Levasseur breathed new life into Wes Craven's 1977 horror classic The Hills Have Eyes, remaking the film in 2006, and giving it a gory more modern edge.  Turnabout was apparently fair play, as capitalizing on the popularity of Aja's reimagining, Wes Craven and his son Jonathan wrote a sequel that continues the story of deformed cannibalistic inbreds living in the mountains of New Mexico.With the element of surprise gone, as often happens with sequels, the focus shifts from generating suspense, to cranking up the violence.  Alien (1979) and its sequel Aliens (1986), is a classic example.  The Hills Have Eyes 2 (2007) follows a similar path, as the hill people are on the warpath, killing or raping anyone who happens into their territory.  Directed by Martin Weisz, the film opens with a woman tired down to a bed, giving birth to a deformed baby.  Having outlived her usefulness, she then receives an axe to the head.  More of that kind of brutality lies ahead, so stop here if you are squeamish.Rather than a defenseless family, this time the primary victims are a fully armed group of National Guard soldiers on training maneuvers in a remote mountainous region known as Sector 16.  As part time soldiers, they aren't experienced in real combat, and when tested beyond their worst nightmare, the guardsmen demonstrate a lack of teamwork, discipline, and judgment, that often directly contributes to their demise.  While mostly inept, what happens isn't entirely the soldier's fault, as the hyper-violent hill people are everywhere, literally popping out of holes in the ground like gophers.Logic and reality are non-existent, as the goal is to simply showcase the soldiers being slaughtered in a series of ferociously brutal attacks.  The Cravens really don't hold back, as the gore is plentiful and the violence extreme.  Those caught unaware, usually wind up dead.  If watching a group of mostly clueless idiots getting massacred is your idea of a good time, this is the film for you.You might be able to predict those who will die, but there are still many surprises, including a suicide, death by friendly fire, accidental demolition, romance in a cave, and a man swimming in a chem-toilet.  While character development is heavy among the soldiers, it is almost nonexistent for the hill folks.  Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) is the leader of the inbred clan, and his frantic fight with the survivors is truly magnificent, with absolutely no mercy being shown on either side.  After this epic struggle, that includes impalement and sledgehammer blows to the crotch, the ending of the film with some weak drivel about Sector 16 is a disgrace, and a major flaw in what is an otherwise uncompromising vision of terror.In only his second feature film, Martin Weisz (Fangoria FrightFest Presents - Grimm Love) demonstrates a flair for shooting action and violence, working in some challenging conditions in Morocco.  The cinematography is often impressive, in this thriller that tops Aja's, in terms of violence and pure visceral impact.Most of the soldiers serve as lambs for the slaughter, and the cast do a good job of filling roles that are written as clich&eacute;d mostly one dimensional stereotypes.  Jessica Stroup (Homecoming) and Daniella Alphonso (Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (Unrated)) play female soldiers who have a little more intelligence and depth to their characters, but neither is able to escape the abuse of the hill people.Critically panned and decried by many, The Hills Have Eyes 2 isn't sophisticated or clever, but intended to shock and revolt, it probably achieves all that it was intended to do, with a devilish charm and ruthless efficiency.

652513,A2EFA8TUP4TF96,B00005JPLQ,"Uhnghrid ""Grope""","[4, 9]","This movie has lots of little things that make it a good movie rather than a mediocre one. It seems alot more solid and well thought-out than the average horror movie, and certainly more so than the first The Hills Have Eyes. There are lots of details that make all the difference. For example, in the first Hills Have Eyes, the enemy always appeared out of nowhere, which was pretty unbelievable and distracting. In this movie, they show one of them run off and slither into a man-sized hole in the hill, and suddenly with that ten-second scene the movie just makes SO much more sense.The characters are neat too. For example, the blonde girl at first seems ditzy and kind of annoying, but gradually and subtley the movie reveals a real personality, as it becomes evident that she's actually very tough and has the semi-depressed and resigned outlook of someone who's come from a rough background.The nasty way people fight when they're in tough situations is REALLY well done: when caught they really do act the way desperate people fighting for their lives would act, doing whatever they can to harm their attacker (eg: poking eye out with finger...). And different characters actually act differently in these situations as well, with the things they choose to do revealing their personalities and how twisted their minds are (eg: the eye-poking was the blonde girl mentioned above).And then there's the great scene where, after knocking a certain enemy out, instead of just turning away and leaving him (which in horror movies guarantees he'll jump back up moments later and attack from behind), one of the characters, in a very understandable and realistic fit of vengeful rage, takes a rock and smashes his skull into a disgusting bloody pulp. This is very satisfying to anyone who watches horror movies and always finds themselves mentally screaming at the characters ""make sure it's dead!""So anyway... I liked it! It's not a brilliant masterpiece, and doesn't have much intellectual depth, but it is definitely one of the better horror movies to come out lately.

652515,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005JPLQ,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","The 2006 remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was a decent slasher-in-the-desert flick; forgettable but entertaining nevertheless. So here we have the 2007 sequel.A group of National Guard trainees go to a mysterious camp in the New Mexican desert to resupply and train, but they find it abandoned. They soon discover that the barren ""hills"" are infested with a bunch of hideous mutant cannibals. Can they get out alive? I was actually impressed with the serious and sometimes moving vibe this film has. It may be a gory slasher flick, but the filmmakers make it respectable. The cussing-every-other-word tends to bring the respectability down, but I was in the Marines and this was how enlisted guys talked in the field, generally speaking. By ""moving"" I refer to the love & loyalty that members of the team reveal for each other over the course of the story and the accompanying score.Some complain about the stupid mistakes the soldiers make but, remember, they're trainees, and National Guardsmen at that, not career soldiers. Besides, mistakes are always made in the heat of life-or-death combat.I heard someone else complain about Jessica Stroup being too good-looking to be a soldier, but I've seen some hot enlisted babes. One girl I knew from high school enlisted in the army and she sent me a pic of her at an Army party in Europe wearing a bunny costume and she was as hot as any Hollywood starlet you'd care to name (she's now a cougar Colonel, lol).The problem with this movie is the thin plot. My description above is the entire story. The whole film's an intense survival situation.Those who like gory slasher or survival flicks should like this, especially if you prefer military-oriented stories. I'm only giving it a fairly low rating because it's not a film I'm anxious to see again. There's just not enough depth, epic-ness or hot women for my tastes (although Jessical Stroup has a really cute face), but that's just me.The film was shot in Morroco (of all places) and runs a short-but-sweet 89 minutes.The DVD I saw is the unrated version.GRADE: C+ (or B for gory slasher fans)",3,Blood & guts survival in the desert,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2094,"['2006', 'remake', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'was', 'decent', 'slasher-in-the-desert', 'flick', 'forgettable', 'entertaining', 'nevertheless', 'So', 'here', 'have', '2007', 'sequel.A', 'group', 'National', 'Guard', 'go', 'mysterious', 'camp', 'New', 'Mexican', 'desert', 'resupply', 'train', 'find', 'abandoned', 'soon', 'discover', 'barren', 'hills', 'are', 'infested', 'bunch', 'hideous', 'mutant', 'cannibals', 'Can', 'get', 'out', 'alive', 'was', 'actually', 'impressed', 'serious', 'sometimes', 'moving', 'vibe', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'gory', 'slasher', 'flick', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'respectable', 'cussing-every-other-word', 'tends', 'bring', 'respectability', 'down', 'was', 'Marines', 'was', 'how', 'enlisted', 'guys', 'talked', 'field', 'generally', 'speaking', 'moving', 'refer', 'love', 'loyalty', 'members', 'team', 'reveal', 'other', 'course', 'story', 'accompanying', 'score.Some', 'complain', 'stupid', 'soldiers', 'make', 'remember', ""'re"", 'trainees', 'National', 'Guardsmen', 'not', 'career', 'soldiers', 'Besides', 'mistakes', 'are', 'always', 'made', 'heat', 'life-or-death', 'combat.I', 'heard', 'someone', 'else', 'complain', 'Jessica', 'Stroup', 'being', 'too', 'good-looking', 'be', 'soldier', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hot', 'enlisted', 'babes', 'One', 'girl', 'knew', 'high', 'school', 'enlisted', 'army', 'sent', 'pic', 'Army', 'party', 'Europe', 'wearing', 'bunny', 'costume', 'was', 'as', 'hot', 'Hollywood', 'starlet', ""'d"", 'care', 'name', 'now', 'cougar', 'Colonel', 'lol', '.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'thin', 'plot', 'description', 'entire', 'story', 'whole', 'film', 'intense', 'survival', 'situation.Those', 'who', 'gory', 'slasher', 'survival', 'flicks', 'should', 'like', 'especially', 'prefer', 'military-oriented', 'stories', ""'m"", 'only', 'giving', 'fairly', 'low', 'rating', 'not', 'film', ""'m"", 'anxious', 'see', 'again', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'depth', 'epic-ness', 'hot', 'women', 'tastes', 'Jessical', 'Stroup', 'really', 'cute', 'face', 'just', 'me.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Morroco', 'places', 'short-but-sweet', '89', 'minutes.The', 'DVD', 'saw', 'unrated', 'version.GRADE', 'C+', 'B', 'gory', 'slasher', 'fans']",The Hills Have Eyes 2 Unrated Edition
