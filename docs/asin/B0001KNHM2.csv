809251,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0001KNHM2,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[4, 5]","Though by now outdated, this 1992 documentary of Aileen Wuornos outlines a tragic, horrible story of a woman who was fated for disaster from childhood, with one terrible event following another, until she was labeled as the ""first woman serial-killer"" for the murder of seven men during 1989-1990, and was betrayed by her girlfriend Tyria Moore into a confession, and also allegedly had her case manipulated by some investigators who were at the same time making movie deals.Aileen was a person who comes off as a tough, street-smart woman, who is also an emotional and psychic disaster zone; the doctors who examined her described her as ""a damaged and primitive child"",Made by Nick Broomfield, this documentary has some fuzzy audio at times, and camera shots that on occasion weave and jump, but there are many sections that are gripping, like the footage of Wuornos in court as well as being interviewed in jail, and the chilling tour of ""Old Sparky"", as the Florida electric chair is nicknamed (in January of 2000, Florida Legislature allowed lethal injection as an alternate method for death).I first heard of Wournos from the TV film ""Overkill: The Aileen Wournos Story"" which had a fabulous portrayal by Jean Smart, but which Wournos herself called ""bogus"".  Since then there have been many books and films on her story, and much money has been made from this woman who lived in poverty, and scratched out a living as a prostitute.Aileen Wournos was executed on October 9th, 2002, by lethal injection.Total running time is 1 hour and 28 minutes, and the only DVD ""Extra"" is the trailer for ""Monster"", the 2003 film for which Charlize Theron received an Oscar for her portrayal of Wuornos.",4,uneven but riveting,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,1695,"['now', 'outdated', '1992', 'documentary', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'tragic', 'horrible', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'fated', 'disaster', 'childhood', 'one', 'terrible', 'event', 'following', 'was', 'labeled', 'first', 'woman', 'serial-killer', 'murder', 'seven', 'men', '1989-1990', 'was', 'betrayed', 'girlfriend', 'Tyria', 'Moore', 'confession', 'also', 'allegedly', 'had', 'case', 'manipulated', 'investigators', 'who', 'were', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'movie', 'deals.Aileen', 'was', 'person', 'who', 'off', 'tough', 'street-smart', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'emotional', 'psychic', 'disaster', 'zone', 'doctors', 'who', 'examined', 'described', 'damaged', 'primitive', 'child', 'Made', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'documentary', 'fuzzy', 'audio', 'times', 'camera', 'shots', 'occasion', 'weave', 'jump', 'are', 'many', 'sections', 'are', 'gripping', 'footage', 'Wuornos', 'court', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'interviewed', 'jail', 'chilling', 'tour', 'Old', 'Sparky', 'Florida', 'electric', 'chair', 'nicknamed', 'January', '2000', 'Florida', 'Legislature', 'allowed', 'lethal', 'injection', 'alternate', 'method', 'death', '.I', 'first', 'heard', 'Wournos', 'TV', 'film', 'Overkill', 'Aileen', 'Wournos', 'Story', 'had', 'fabulous', 'portrayal', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'Wournos', 'called', 'bogus', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'books', 'films', 'story', 'much', 'money', 'been', 'made', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'poverty', 'scratched', 'out', 'living', 'prostitute.Aileen', 'Wournos', 'was', 'executed', 'October', '9th', '2002', 'lethal', 'injection.Total', 'running', 'time', '1', 'hour', '28', 'minutes', 'only', 'DVD', 'Extra', 'trailer', 'Monster', '2003', 'film', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'received', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Wuornos']",N/A

809253,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B0001KNHM2,Chris Luallen,"[2, 4]","Aileen Wuornos became known as America's first ""female serial killer"" after committing a series of 7 murders against men who solicited her as a prostitute. Aileen claimed self-defense from rape but ended up pleading guilty upon the advice of her incompetent lawyer, Steve Glazer, and her nutty fundamentalist adopted step-mother, Arlene Praelle.The best part of the film was the interview with Aileen herself. She comes across as a person who is clearly emotionally damaged, partially due to childhood sexual abuse by her father. But she also is suprisingly intelligent and aware of how she is being used and manipulated by those around her.Much of the rest of the movie involves the director, Nick Broomfield, visiting with Steve and Arlene in hopes they can help him set up an interview with Aileen. Steve and Arlene demand money for themselves and definitely come across badly. But I also think Bromfield himself comes across as a hypocrite since he, like they, is obviously using Aileen in order to make money and advance his career.Aileen, on the other hand, is angry about how she is being abused by the system, especially the corrupt cops who are involved in a movie deal based on her case. But, of course, she is in jail and powerless to change her circumstances. She is hoping Broomfield can help her get an appeal. But he seems not to have helped her much in that regard.Florida politicians, the court system, bad cops, Aileen's lousy lawyer and crazy stepmom, all are held up to the light here and come out looking terribly.",4,Interesting Critique Of The American Legal System Marred By Hypocritical Director,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,1535,"['Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'became', 'known', 'America', 'first', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'committing', 'series', '7', 'murders', 'men', 'who', 'solicited', 'prostitute', 'Aileen', 'claimed', 'self-defense', 'rape', 'ended', 'up', 'pleading', 'guilty', 'advice', 'incompetent', 'lawyer', 'Steve', 'Glazer', 'nutty', 'fundamentalist', 'adopted', 'step-mother', 'Arlene', 'Praelle.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'interview', 'Aileen', 'across', 'person', 'who', 'clearly', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'partially', 'due', 'childhood', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'father', 'also', 'suprisingly', 'intelligent', 'aware', 'how', 'being', 'used', 'manipulated', 'her.Much', 'rest', 'movie', 'director', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'visiting', 'Steve', 'Arlene', 'hopes', 'can', 'help', 'set', 'up', 'interview', 'Aileen', 'Steve', 'Arlene', 'demand', 'money', 'definitely', 'come', 'badly', 'also', 'think', 'Bromfield', 'across', 'hypocrite', 'obviously', 'using', 'Aileen', 'order', 'make', 'money', 'advance', 'career.Aileen', 'other', 'hand', 'angry', 'how', 'being', 'abused', 'system', 'especially', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'movie', 'deal', 'based', 'case', 'course', 'jail', 'powerless', 'change', 'circumstances', 'hoping', 'Broomfield', 'can', 'help', 'get', 'appeal', 'not', 'have', 'helped', 'much', 'regard.Florida', 'politicians', 'court', 'system', 'bad', 'cops', 'Aileen', 'lousy', 'lawyer', 'crazy', 'stepmom', 'are', 'held', 'up', 'light', 'here', 'come', 'out', 'looking', 'terribly']",N/A

There is little discussion about whom she murdered or exactly for what reasons other than Ms. Wuornos claim of `self-defense'.  Although it can be interesting to see the large range of human reactions from Ms. Wuornos, there is little insight as to her motives.  The big stars here are the putrid, immoral folks who befriend her `in her best interest'.  Enter her absolutely beyond sleazy attorney `born-again' Christian lawyer.  Ms. Wuornos even has a middle-aged woman adopt her and despite her cutesy attitude, it becomes clear she is a moronic minded scammer as well.  Both the lawyer and the adoptive parent are out to make money on the selling of movie rights of their `client' and `daughter'.  The only thing more sickening is the revelation that several local police are also into `cashing in' on movie rights.  This is a tale of greed and dehumanization; not necessarily a story on a female serial killer.  It is not the least bit pleasant, nor does it contain any useful message, other than people can be cruel.

To the woman who adopted her to sell interviews at 10 grand a pop to her incompetent lawyer who both abused her civil rights and sold her out.
