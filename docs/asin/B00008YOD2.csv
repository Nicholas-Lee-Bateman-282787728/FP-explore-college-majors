The bad guy wants people to change their ways, so why not open a counseling center; no, instead through some source of funding and high understanding of electronics, etc...he puts together grand schemes in which people get killed.  The ending of the movie was a complete joke.  Why would one of the abductees work for someone that tried to kill her?  She was thrown into a pit of needles and still she plays along; I think she would have just given up.  Innocent people die around her and she doesn't care to help them.  Also, the people in the house work against eachother for some odd reason,rather than help eachother out.  Where did the bad get the nerve gas and antidote.  Nothing like that is explained.  I think in the next movie they should have everyone work together and then defeat the bad guy/girl.

750424,A34VV92TSLC37R,B00008YOD2,Adam Craig,"[1, 1]","Saw II takes a much different approach to the victims of Jigsaw than did the first film.  In the first film, the viewer was basically just as trapped as the two men in the bathroom.  We had no idea what was actually going on, and the only way it was revealed to us was through flashbacks.  Toward the end of the film, we were given an outside perspective from a couple of different characters, but the majority of the film was limited to what was going on between Adam and Dr. Gordon in the bathroom, and that was what made the film great.Saw II tries a different approach.  The movie begins with the apprehension of the Jigsaw killer, but he has one last game to play with the arresting detective.  Jigsaw has kidnapped his son and put him in a locked down house with 7 other people, releasing a deadly gas through the ventilation system.  That is the game the captives have to play.  Each of them has a room with an antidote, and a sick game the victim has to play to retrieve the antidote.  Regretfully, we don't get to see all of the rooms and all of the sick games that Jigsaw has set up, we only get 3 or 4 glimpses of the sick, depraved torture methods he has set up.  The movie takes place equally from the viewpoint of those inside the trap, and the detective interrogating Jigsaw in his hideout, while watching what is occurring in the house on video monitors.I wouldn't really call Saw II a ""horror"" film.  Yes, it has a lot of gore, and there are a couple moments that make you jump, but it is definitely not a scary film.  It is, however, a very entertaining film, and a worthy follow-up to the first film, which I enjoyed immensely.  The second film also tries to pull a huge twist at the end, and, while it isn't as big of a shocker as the original, the twist is still pretty good and leaves the viewer scratching their head.  Although I would argue that the twist in this movie is much more plausible than the twist from the original, and maybe that is why it isn't quite as good.Bottom line, if you enjoyed Saw, you will definitely like the sequel.  A lot of the people I know who liked Saw think this one is better, I don't agree, but I still think this is a pretty good film that is worth watching at least a couple times to try to catch all the stuff that is happening.Here's looking forward to Saw III.",4,"Not as good as the first, but still entertaining",1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,2323,"['Saw', 'II', 'much', 'different', 'approach', 'victims', 'Jigsaw', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'viewer', 'was', 'basically', 'just', 'as', 'trapped', 'two', 'men', 'bathroom', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'only', 'way', 'was', 'revealed', 'was', 'flashbacks', 'end', 'film', 'were', 'given', 'outside', 'perspective', 'couple', 'different', 'characters', 'majority', 'film', 'was', 'limited', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Adam', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'bathroom', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'film', 'great.Saw', 'II', 'different', 'approach', 'movie', 'apprehension', 'Jigsaw', 'killer', 'one', 'last', 'game', 'play', 'arresting', 'detective', 'Jigsaw', 'kidnapped', 'son', 'put', 'locked', 'down', 'house', '7', 'other', 'people', 'releasing', 'deadly', 'gas', 'ventilation', 'system', 'game', 'captives', 'have', 'play', 'room', 'antidote', 'sick', 'game', 'victim', 'play', 'retrieve', 'antidote', 'Regretfully', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'rooms', 'sick', 'games', 'Jigsaw', 'set', 'up', 'only', 'get', '3', '4', 'glimpses', 'sick', 'depraved', 'torture', 'methods', 'set', 'up', 'movie', 'place', 'equally', 'viewpoint', 'trap', 'detective', 'interrogating', 'Jigsaw', 'hideout', 'watching', 'what', 'occurring', 'house', 'video', 'monitors.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'Saw', 'II', 'horror', 'film', 'Yes', 'lot', 'gore', 'are', 'couple', 'moments', 'make', 'jump', 'definitely', 'not', 'scary', 'film', 'however', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'worthy', 'follow-up', 'first', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'second', 'film', 'also', 'pull', 'huge', 'twist', 'end', ""n't"", 'as', 'big', 'shocker', 'original', 'twist', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'viewer', 'scratching', 'head', 'would', 'argue', 'twist', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'plausible', 'twist', 'original', 'maybe', 'why', ""n't"", 'quite', 'good.Bottom', 'line', 'enjoyed', 'Saw', 'will', 'definitely', 'sequel', 'lot', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'liked', 'Saw', 'think', 'one', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'still', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'couple', 'times', 'try', 'catch', 'stuff', 'looking', 'forward', 'Saw', 'III']",Saw II

750426,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00008YOD2,A. Estes,"[6, 8]","Well, here it is. Just one year after the original ""Saw"" was a surprise hit, ""Saw II"" has arrived, and rather swiftly at that. I was kind of skeptical walking into the theater about whether or not this movie could live up to the first one. Afterall, sequels that are put out this quickly tend to lack in quality (especially when it comes to the horror genre). But rest assured, ""Saw II"" definitely delivers. In typical sequel fashion, it ups the ante on gore, the cast is bigger, the jumps are higher and the story more complicated. Just like the first movie, it is whip-smart and will keep you guessing right until the very end.Now, I'm not gonna pretend that this movie is perfect. While it is obviously better than 99 percent of the ""horror"" movies out today (and the fact that it isn't a remake earns it bonus points) it still does suffer in a few parts. The main point being that the cast is too large, and in turn, hardly any of the characters are developed to the point where the audience really cares. Half of what made ""Saw"" so good was the dynamic between Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell, whose characters were fleshed out really well and truly carried the movie. Here, the cast is tripled, and when you cram them into a 90 minute time slot, there just isn't much time to get to know them. Donnie Wahlberg as the bad cop/bad father and Tobin Bell as ""John"" are the standouts and both are absolutely brilliant in the film. The other actors were good, but just not enough screen time. Also, the torture/death scenes -- while inventive -- were a little predictable. You see what's going to happen before you're supposed to. Even still though, the plot (which was written once again by Whannell) twists and turns so many times and keeps you on your toes the whole way. This is really one movie where you're not gonna want to step out to the bathroom. Each bit of dialogue is crucial. Like the original, this one is a giant jigsaw puzzle that only makes sense in the final minutes. Director Darren Lynn Bousman is a perfect successor to James Wan, despite the fact that most of his experience lies in music videos. The man handles this film with much class and style. It looks and feels just like the first one did -- without coming off as a retread (the tie-in to the original at the end of the movie was a nice touch, by the way).Overall, despite it's few flaws, ""Saw II"" is the must-see movie this Halloween season. If you loved the first, you'll want to check this out. I guarantee it will surprise you and will leave you walking out with so many questions and so much to talk about. And not to give anything away, but there is definitely room left for ""Saw III"" -- which is already in the works. Hopefully next Halloween we can look forward to having our nerves fried once again.",4,"A Real, Refreshing Horror Movie And A Respectable Sequel.",1130716800,"10 31, 2005",2005,2787,"['Well', 'here', 'Just', 'one', 'year', 'original', 'Saw', 'was', 'surprise', 'hit', 'Saw', 'II', 'arrived', 'rather', 'swiftly', 'was', 'kind', 'skeptical', 'walking', 'theater', 'not', 'movie', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'first', 'one', 'Afterall', 'sequels', 'are', 'put', 'out', 'quickly', 'tend', 'lack', 'quality', 'especially', 'when', 'horror', 'genre', 'rest', 'assured', 'Saw', 'II', 'definitely', 'delivers', 'typical', 'sequel', 'fashion', 'ante', 'gore', 'cast', 'bigger', 'jumps', 'are', 'higher', 'story', 'more', 'complicated', 'Just', 'first', 'movie', 'whip-smart', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'right', 'very', 'end.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'pretend', 'movie', 'perfect', 'obviously', 'better', '99', 'percent', 'horror', 'movies', 'out', 'today', 'fact', ""n't"", 'remake', 'points', 'still', 'suffer', 'few', 'parts', 'main', 'point', 'being', 'cast', 'too', 'large', 'turn', 'hardly', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'point', 'where', 'audience', 'really', 'Half', 'what', 'made', 'Saw', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'dynamic', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'characters', 'were', 'fleshed', 'out', 'really', 'well', 'truly', 'carried', 'movie', 'Here', 'cast', 'tripled', 'when', 'cram', '90', 'minute', 'time', 'slot', 'just', ""n't"", 'much', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'bad', 'cop/bad', 'father', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'John', 'are', 'standouts', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'film', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'Also', 'torture/death', 'scenes', 'inventive', 'were', 'little', 'predictable', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'happen', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'Even', 'still', 'plot', 'was', 'written', 'once', 'again', 'Whannell', 'twists', 'turns', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'toes', 'whole', 'way', 'really', 'one', 'movie', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'gon', 'want', 'step', 'out', 'bathroom', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'crucial', 'original', 'one', 'giant', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'only', 'sense', 'final', 'minutes', 'Director', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'perfect', 'successor', 'James', 'Wan', 'fact', 'most', 'experience', 'music', 'videos', 'man', 'film', 'much', 'class', 'style', 'just', 'first', 'one', 'did', 'coming', 'off', 'retread', 'tie-in', 'original', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'way', '.Overall', 'few', 'flaws', 'Saw', 'II', 'must-see', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'season', 'loved', 'first', ""'ll"", 'want', 'check', 'guarantee', 'will', 'surprise', 'will', 'leave', 'walking', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'so', 'much', 'talk', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'definitely', 'room', 'left', 'Saw', 'III', 'already', 'works', 'Hopefully', 'next', 'Halloween', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'having', 'nerves', 'fried', 'once', 'again']",Saw II

750428,A2XZE1TB784HKX,B00008YOD2,"alex fryling ""youngfry""","[0, 1]",In my opinion this was the best movie out of all of them in the saw series. Saw one was awesome for the time but this movie topped it because of the brutality and because they were able to move room to room. In this movie you have to play close attention especially the first time because it can get confusing and the end you will have to follow. The directors for this movie did such a great job in the storyline everything set up to perfection. There were so many brutal parts in this movie but I have to say the one that was the most brutal was when the girl was thrown into the stack of heroine needles to find the key. It makes your skin stand up on the back of your neck. Also the movie was given enough time to develop and it had a nice flow to it so it wasn't rushed. The great thing about this is at the end the movie ends and gives you a good ending but they leave you with the thought what's going to happen next. Making you have to come see the third movie how it will play out. Overall this was just a great production. Horror movies over the last few years have had some steps taken backwards but this is a different type of horror movie. It sets a whole new standard were it plays more with your mind instead of having a slasher movie killing everyone. Great movie and you can expect the saw series to continue on from here.,5,Saw 2 IS the Best In The Saw Series and A 5 Star DVD,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,1339,"['opinion', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'saw', 'series', 'Saw', 'one', 'was', 'awesome', 'time', 'movie', 'topped', 'brutality', 'were', 'able', 'move', 'room', 'room', 'movie', 'have', 'play', 'close', 'attention', 'especially', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'get', 'confusing', 'end', 'will', 'have', 'follow', 'directors', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'storyline', 'everything', 'set', 'up', 'perfection', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'brutal', 'parts', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'was', 'most', 'brutal', 'was', 'when', 'girl', 'was', 'thrown', 'stack', 'heroine', 'needles', 'find', 'key', 'skin', 'stand', 'up', 'back', 'neck', 'Also', 'movie', 'was', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'develop', 'had', 'nice', 'flow', 'was', ""n't"", 'rushed', 'great', 'thing', 'end', 'movie', 'good', 'ending', 'leave', 'thought', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'Making', 'have', 'come', 'see', 'third', 'movie', 'how', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'Overall', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'production', 'Horror', 'movies', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'had', 'steps', 'taken', 'backwards', 'different', 'type', 'horror', 'movie', 'whole', 'new', 'standard', 'were', 'more', 'mind', 'instead', 'having', 'slasher', 'movie', 'killing', 'everyone', 'Great', 'movie', 'can', 'expect', 'saw', 'series', 'continue', 'here']",Saw II

750433,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00008YOD2,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I was excited about this film, truly excited.  I really enjoyed the first `Saw' film and just had the highest of hopes for the sequel.  I think that's why in the end it proved to be such a disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, when I walked out of the theater I was in heaven.  I loved what I had just seen.  It was gruesome, disturbing and to an extent quite scary.  After a second watch through though I realized that this film is so far below the original it's ridiculous.  The concept for this film is just too simple when compared to the original film.  The only similarity between the two is the villain and even that takes an unwarranted twist.  Yes, the final sequence was a head-scratcher but it couldn't hold a candle to the mastery that was the original `Saw' conclusion.The film centers again around mastermind Jigsaw as he sets up yet another elaborate trap, this time collecting a group of ex-convicts in an abandoned house filled with deadly gas with antidotes spread throughout the house.  In order for them to get these antidotes they must do some horrific things.  One of the victims is young Daniel Matthews whose father, Police Detective Eric Matthews, has captured Jigsaw and is trying desperately (and quite uncivilly) to force into giving up the houses location.Sadly `Saw II' becomes a showcase for gruesome deaths and disturbing sights over mental breakdown and mind bending horror.  I say `sadly' for a reason.  The original `Saw' was not all that gory.  Sure there were some bloody sequences and some disturbing events but for the most part `Saw' was a mental game, a mind tease if you will.  `Saw II' feels like a cop out almost.  It feels like any other slasher film and that is a disappointment since I expected so much more.There are some good things about this film, Tobin Bell for one who expands upon his original role as Jigsaw with some exceptional results, but story wise `Saw II' fails.  As far as the death scenes are concerned, sure they make you squirm and that's a plus right, and that pit of syringes still gets to me when I think about it, but all of this can't make up for the lack or originality.  It's dark, it's disturbing, it's gory and it's very uninspired.  I have yet to see the third and fourth `Saw' offerings mainly because this was such a let down.  I'm sure I'll get to the rest of the series to form my own opinions; hopefully they will be an improvement.The acting here is an improvement upon the original, well, at least some of it is.  Donnie Wahlberg (who could be brother Mark's twin I swear) has a much better grasp on his character than Cary Elwes did.  Shawnee Smith does decently here as does Erik Knudsen and of course Tobin Bell.  The rest of the cast is decent at best.

And that opening scene...that guy CAN'T ACT!For what it's worth, if you find absurd blood and alpha male being all mean scary, then you may find this interesting.  At least, they avoided some perverse sex/violence scene.What's worse, is when you watch the extras you learn the writers buy into this absurd notion of torturing people to make them enjoy life.

John Kramer aka the Jigsaw Killer returns for the second installment of the Saw series. In the midst of a divorce from his wife and the rebellious nature of his son, Eric Mathews is in a tough time of his life. Unbeknown to him, it is about to get a hell of a lot more tense. The Jigsaw is about to teach him a lesson about his life and now he deals with it. Can he save his only son as is poisoned to death by a toxic nerve-agent before he can save himself? Or will the Jigsaw once more come out victorious?Saw II returns to the original concept of the original. The new installment though seems a little stale. The idea of a serial killer that doesn't kill anyone, even though intriguing in the first film, is definitely starting to lose its freshness. Starting to smell a little funky. The first Saw was smart and unique. Saw II is a step down from the original script written by Leigh Whannell and Saw I director, James Wan. With Wan gone from this picture and Bousman added, there seems to be a lack of chemistry between Whannell and the director of Saw II, compared to the director of Saw I.There are a few attributes of this film that are the makings of a noticeable and downward spiral for the Saw series. First off, that I noticed, has got to be the lighting. In the first film, the lighting was gritty and sickly-looking, which was one of my favorite parts of he original. Saw II though, is cast in a perpetual shadow. More then three-quarters of the movie are inhabited by a sheer darkness that interrupts some the gritty and unhygienic feel of the first one. The acting was also a low point of this film. Both Donnie Wahlberg and Shawnee Smith are unqualified to have leading roles and show it by not pulling off their roles.On the other hand, Tobin Bell as Jigsaw was even more creepy then in the first movie. But then again, the first movie only allowed him a short part to play. Saw II delves deeper in to the character of John Kramer, also known as the Jigsaw. The character of John Kramer is a very sick man. With his body infected with terminal cancer, he has decided to spend the rest of his short time remaining, teaching other people to enjoy life while you have it. Through putting people in a position where it's either you face your fears or you die, he believes that people will have a change of heart. For playing a very complex character, Tobin Bell pulls off quite a stellar job as this monster.With Saw II in the theaters, and Saw III already in preproduction, people can only imagine what else the Saw series has in store for us. The gore and ruthlessness of the first movie is still there and will sure bring back fans of the first one. But I would not recommend seeing Saw II without have previously seeing the first. Even if you already have seen Saw II, but have yet to seen Saw I, I would recommend seeing the first. Saw was an original, uncomfortable, and suspenseful joy-ride of a film, but Saw II is a shell of it's former self. But who knows, the solution to Saw III may prove all of us naysayers wrong. Saw II could be a lot better if some more things are proven and shown in the third film. But don't look for spoilers before you see the movies!

The second ""Saw"" is not boring or dumb - it's rather interesting to watch and to follow the story-line. It's interesting to expect the upcoming plot-twist and identification of a killer. But from this kind of a film you always expect something more than just being an ordinary thriller. Unfortunately here you don't get anything except a certain number of used cliches. In the end I got so many questions I didn't know whom to ask. I'm not going to ask now not to spoil the movie for you, I'll just say there are so many flaws in the film... Its creators didn't even try to cover them up. OK, every film has some, and I usually tend not to notice them, but here it was just outrageous.There are successful movies with just a couple of main characters (like ""Saw"", ""Cube"" or ""Blair Witch Project""). When sequel is being made filmmakers stick much more characters into it because they just don't know what to do with this amount of film time. They don't have a talent (like makers of the original) to make a picture with two main characters so it could be intense and gripping and thrilling. It's easier to kill another character every 10 minutes than to keep a viewer breathless for hour and a half, concentrating on just two persons.In ""Saw 2"" when I saw this bunch of people obviously going to get murdered, I understood right away - this won't be a talented thriller.Yes, it has its tense moments, thrill and gore, but as I said, from this kind of film you expect a lot more.A definite potboiler.",2,NOT MOVIE-- BUT MONEY-MAKING,1133395200,"12 1, 2005",2005,1618,"['was', ""n't"", 'much', 'impressed', 'first', 'Saw', 'now', 'realize', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'comparing', 'sequel', 'second', 'Saw', 'not', 'boring', 'dumb', 'rather', 'interesting', 'watch', 'follow', 'story-line', 'interesting', 'expect', 'upcoming', 'plot-twist', 'identification', 'killer', 'kind', 'film', 'always', 'expect', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'being', 'ordinary', 'thriller', 'Unfortunately', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'certain', 'number', 'used', 'cliches', 'end', 'got', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'whom', 'ask', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'ask', 'now', 'not', 'spoil', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'flaws', 'film', 'creators', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'cover', 'up', 'OK', 'film', 'usually', 'tend', 'not', 'notice', 'here', 'was', 'just', 'outrageous.There', 'are', 'successful', 'movies', 'just', 'couple', 'main', 'characters', 'Saw', 'Cube', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'When', 'sequel', 'being', 'made', 'filmmakers', 'stick', 'much', 'more', 'characters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'amount', 'film', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'talent', 'makers', 'original', 'make', 'picture', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'intense', 'gripping', 'thrilling', 'easier', 'kill', 'character', '10', 'minutes', 'keep', 'viewer', 'breathless', 'hour', 'half', 'concentrating', 'just', 'two', 'persons.In', 'Saw', '2', 'when', 'saw', 'bunch', 'people', 'obviously', 'going', 'get', 'murdered', 'understood', 'right', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'talented', 'thriller.Yes', 'tense', 'moments', 'thrill', 'gore', 'said', 'kind', 'film', 'expect', 'lot', 'more.A', 'definite', 'potboiler']",Saw II

Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[0, 0]","Saw was and still is an amazing movie, and to me there is no movie killer more genius than Jigsaw, with the exception of Hannibal, of course. His unique traps and his twisted altruism just attracts you to his character. It's virtually impossible to hate this man, especially after the twist in the last movie. Not only that, but he's capable of fulfilling that old saying ""Fool me once..."" blah blah. Saw II is the ""fool me twice"" part of that saying.Though since Saw ended by revealing the identity of the killer known as Jigsaw, Saw II obviously had to go in another direction. And surprisingly, the twists in this one are as convincing as they were in the last one. It's just difficult to talk about them in the review without spoiling the movie. So I'll say this straight off: If you loved Saw then there is absolutely no reason why you can't love this. And if you hated Saw, perhaps because of the gore, then obviously stay away. Saw II did everything good (depending on your interpretation of ""good"") that the first movie did and adds some.Since good horror films are so sparse (is this even a horror film, or a suspense/thriller), I can't recommend this movie enough.

I don't know what I was expecting going into it but I got way more than I thought I would.  I consider 'Saw' to be about the most effective psychological thriller I have seen since 'Seven'.  So I was a bit wary, especially after its immense success, to hear that a sequel was being rushed to be put out around a year after the original.  Now for a film in Hollywood to be written, shot, edited, and released in less than a year...that usually spells doom.  And for a sequel it signals that the studio is cashing in on the original's success.  And when the director and co-writer of the original(James Wan)drops out, you have to figure that the sequel is going to be another log squeezed out of the Hollywood turd factory.But you would be wrong.  'Saw II' is a very effective sequel.  There are three carryovers from the original:  Tobin Bell as Jigsaw(who we find his real name to be John Kramer), Shawnee Smith as Amanda(the only Jigsaw victim to ever survive one of his ""games""), and Dina Meyer as Kerry, a detective obsessed with catching Jigsaw.Newly introduced is Donnie Walberg as a burnout cop with family problems who is partnered with Meyer's character and is unexpectedly brought into Jigsaw's web when Walberg's son is kidnapped and put into one of the killer's ""games"".  Walberg's son is trapped in a house with a few other new victims.  Their connection to one another, at first, is unknown but eventually comes to fruition.The violence is gruesome and plentiful.  The script is tight and while not as clever as its predecessor, it is effective.  The acting is very good:  Bell, as everything he is in, is excellent along with some very fine performances by Walberg and Smith.  Basically, if you like 'Saw' you are definitely going to like this sequel.  And I'm sure next Halloween, 'Saw III' will be opening up to more packed theatres.And you gotta smile when a little $4 million dollar('Saw II's budget)film is kicking the crap out of so-called $100 million dollar blockbusters in the box office receipts.

The film made decent box-office and soon a sequel was greenlighted to take advantage of the new franchise while horror movies were hot. This time around Whannel has a different newcomer to direct Saw II. Darren Lynn Bousman was tapped to make sense of Leigh Whannel's script for the sequel. Once again, Whannel's talent in writing credible and non-cheesy dialogue is average at best and pretty so-so most of the time. The acting was serviceable and pretty decent for a horror flick. Most of the time acting's usually not the highest of priorities in such films. As long as the actors show a decent amount of talent on the screen then everything else they do is gravy.Once more the film takes the premise of a sort of demented gamemaster calling himself Jigsaw (again Tobin Bell plays the role with relish and aplomb) who takes individuals he's deemed as not worthy of the lives their leading and puts them in complex and demented games where there's only two options: live or die and the choice is up always up to the contestant. This time around Jigsaw has chosen eight people who at first has nothing in common with each other but as the story moves forward one thing ties them all together. A slow-acting nerve gas has been seeping into their boarded up room and they have two hours to solve puzzles that will give them acess to the antidote needed to counteract the nerve-agent. The twist this time around is that each puzzle also has a trap attached to it and sometimes solving the puzzle means having to shed blood. Blood that is either the participants or a bystander's. The gruesome traps range from hidden blades in glass boxes, an industrial furnace, a pit of used needles, etc... The pit of needles still give chills whenever I think about it.To add to this maze of traps and puzzles, Jigsaw also involves an outside character played by Donnie Wahlberg. Wahlberg's character is a burnt-out cop who has everything to lose if he doesn't play Jigsaw's game and his choice on how to play the game results in a twist at the end that wasn't easily seen and predicted. The twist in the end of Saw II was cleverly pulled off and added more to the demented genius that the Jigsaw character gives off. This character is fast joining the classic ranks of horror villains like Hannibal Lecter, Freddie, Michael Myers and Jason. I actually think he's one-upped the character of John Doe from Fincher's Seven. It helps that Tobin Bell has again put in another chilling performance as Jigsaw.Saw II delivers on everything that the first film had and improves on it with better pacing and tighter direction from Darren Lynn Bousman. With a bigger budget and more space to work with (an entire two story house instead of a single showerroom), Saw II added more action in addition to ramping up the disturbing scens of gore and deaths. Each death doesn't have the carnival glee that the Final Destination films have. Instead each death is meant to disturb and induce cringes and winces from its audience. The clever ending leaves for a second sequel to be made and I for one wouldn't mind visiting with Jigsaw and company one more time.",4,One of the rare sequels that actually improves on the original,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,3247,"['2004', 'actor-writer', 'Leigh', 'Whannel', 'firsttime', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'released', 'low-budget', 'horror-thriller', 'called', 'Saw', 'film', 'made', 'decent', 'box-office', 'soon', 'sequel', 'was', 'greenlighted', 'take', 'advantage', 'new', 'franchise', 'horror', 'movies', 'were', 'hot', 'time', 'around', 'Whannel', 'different', 'newcomer', 'direct', 'Saw', 'II', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'was', 'tapped', 'make', 'sense', 'Leigh', 'Whannel', 'script', 'sequel', 'Once', 'again', 'Whannel', 'talent', 'writing', 'credible', 'non-cheesy', 'dialogue', 'average', 'best', 'pretty', 'so-so', 'most', 'time', 'acting', 'was', 'serviceable', 'pretty', 'decent', 'horror', 'flick', 'Most', 'time', 'acting', 'usually', 'not', 'highest', 'priorities', 'such', 'films', 'As', 'long', 'actors', 'show', 'decent', 'amount', 'talent', 'screen', 'then', 'everything', 'else', 'do', 'gravy.Once', 'more', 'film', 'premise', 'sort', 'demented', 'gamemaster', 'calling', 'Jigsaw', 'again', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'role', 'relish', 'aplomb', 'who', 'individuals', 'deemed', 'not', 'lives', 'leading', 'complex', 'demented', 'games', 'where', 'only', 'two', 'options', 'live', 'die', 'choice', 'up', 'always', 'contestant', 'time', 'around', 'Jigsaw', 'chosen', 'eight', 'people', 'who', 'first', 'nothing', 'common', 'other', 'story', 'forward', 'one', 'thing', 'together', 'slow-acting', 'nerve', 'gas', 'been', 'seeping', 'boarded', 'up', 'room', 'have', 'two', 'hours', 'solve', 'puzzles', 'will', 'give', 'acess', 'antidote', 'needed', 'counteract', 'nerve-agent', 'twist', 'time', 'around', 'puzzle', 'also', 'trap', 'attached', 'sometimes', 'solving', 'puzzle', 'having', 'shed', 'blood', 'Blood', 'participants', 'bystander', 'gruesome', 'traps', 'range', 'hidden', 'blades', 'glass', 'boxes', 'industrial', 'furnace', 'pit', 'used', 'needles', 'etc', 'pit', 'needles', 'still', 'give', 'chills', 'whenever', 'think', 'it.To', 'add', 'maze', 'traps', 'puzzles', 'Jigsaw', 'also', 'outside', 'character', 'played', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Wahlberg', 'character', 'burnt-out', 'cop', 'who', 'everything', 'lose', ""n't"", 'play', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'choice', 'how', 'play', 'game', 'results', 'twist', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'easily', 'seen', 'predicted', 'twist', 'end', 'Saw', 'II', 'was', 'cleverly', 'pulled', 'off', 'added', 'more', 'demented', 'genius', 'Jigsaw', 'character', 'off', 'character', 'fast', 'joining', 'classic', 'ranks', 'horror', 'villains', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Freddie', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Jason', 'actually', 'think', 'one-upped', 'character', 'John', 'Doe', 'Fincher', 'Seven', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'again', 'put', 'chilling', 'performance', 'Jigsaw.Saw', 'II', 'delivers', 'everything', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'improves', 'better', 'pacing', 'tighter', 'direction', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'bigger', 'budget', 'more', 'space', 'work', 'entire', 'two', 'story', 'house', 'instead', 'single', 'showerroom', 'Saw', 'II', 'added', 'more', 'action', 'addition', 'ramping', 'up', 'disturbing', 'scens', 'gore', 'deaths', 'death', ""n't"", 'have', 'carnival', 'glee', 'Final', 'Destination', 'films', 'have', 'Instead', 'death', 'meant', 'disturb', 'induce', 'cringes', 'winces', 'audience', 'clever', 'ending', 'leaves', 'second', 'sequel', 'be', 'made', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'visiting', 'Jigsaw', 'company', 'one', 'more', 'time']",Saw II

750444,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00008YOD2,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","`Saw II', directed and co-authored by Darren Lynn Boosman probably surprised many by being very successful in the theatre last year, although the original movie in this series was both critically and commercially a bit more successful than the average low budget horror flick, even without a big name such as George Romero or Wes Craven behind the writing and the camera.I was moderately impressed with the original and I believe this second installment succeeds in being as modestly good as the original, while being just original enough to be interesting in its own right.The most facinating thing about this story and the way it plays out is that it gives a new look at how emotional, bordering on sheer stupidity, people can be when they are faced with a horrific situation. The classic example of this blindness of rationality is when Jamie Lee Curtis retreats into a basement as she is running away from Michael Myers in Halloween (I). Reason would tell one to not let yourself be backed into a corner. The situation in Saw II is a bit different in that the victims, like the crew of the Nostromo in `Alien' are already trapped in a seemingly inescapable enclosure. The problem is not physical escape, but in solving a puzzle which requires the cooperation of the seven prisoners.Business trainers hammer constantly on the importance of teamwork in accomplishing things. We are not born with this intuition and if we never played a team sport, we may never have encountered this principle in either our mathematics or Shakespeare or French classes in college. The seven prisoners presented with this puzzle don't need management training to tell them they need to cooperate. Their captor, `Jigsaw', tells them straight away that the solution for their escape depends on cooperation in the two hours they have before the poison gas to which they are exposed does its worst. Over the course of the next 90 minutes, most of the seven die off largely through stupidity fuelled by terror plus selfishness. The failure of the imprisoned principles to have reason overcome fear and greed is one of the two most interesting aspects of the movie. The second, similar theme is the stupidity of the police, primarily of the principle character played by Donnie Wahlberg, to pay attention to what the perp is saying in order to solve his puzzles.Much credit has to be given to the several horrific traps and tortures to which the perp puts his victims. Compared to some of these perils, Jason's ax and Michael Myers' chef's knife are not much more than deadly kitty toys. Aside from the ingenious conceptions by the writers, there is the excellent realization of these deadly devices in safe Hollywood simulacra. There is not a single clue that what looks like the inevitable mayhem created by the meeting of sharp stainless steel with unprotected flesh is actually done with plastic and cosmetic appliances. While the director's commentary makes it clear that this movie was done on a relatively small budget, it seems like the writers, the director, and the editor, put too much effort into whiz-bang collages with rapidly shifting camera angles rather than dwelling on careful closeups showing the realization of peril on faces rather than spending time on screams and blood.While the puzzles, the perils, the booby traps, and the threat of time running out are the movie's strong points, along with the audience's frustration with the blindness of reason shown by the vics, the greatest weakness is that the perp's motives are never resolved or even fully explained. Although the principle character is a despicable person, there is no reason why the perp takes it upon himself to rain vengence down on his shoulders, especially by putting the lead character's (relatively) innocent son at risk.Overall, the story line in this sequel is richer and psychologically more interesting than the first, but both are a bit weak on story.If you like horror movies, you will certainly like this one. Most of the extras are relatively ordinary, with the most interesting being the revelations of how the special effects teams made plastic and foam and fiber optic cable look like hardwood and iron and stainless steel. My favorite extra, the director's commentary almost totally ignores the psychologically interesting aspects of the story and spends all its time dwelling on the problems of shooting and the skill of the actors in certain situations.More interesting than the average bloodfest, with grounds for looking forward to `Saw III'.",5,"Excellent, but somewhat wasted psychology of terror.",1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,4530,"['Saw', 'II', 'directed', 'co-authored', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Boosman', 'probably', 'surprised', 'many', 'being', 'very', 'successful', 'theatre', 'last', 'year', 'original', 'movie', 'series', 'was', 'critically', 'commercially', 'bit', 'more', 'successful', 'average', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'flick', 'even', 'big', 'name', 'such', 'George', 'Romero', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'writing', 'camera.I', 'was', 'moderately', 'impressed', 'original', 'believe', 'second', 'installment', 'being', 'modestly', 'good', 'original', 'being', 'just', 'original', 'enough', 'be', 'interesting', 'own', 'right.The', 'most', 'facinating', 'thing', 'story', 'way', 'out', 'new', 'look', 'how', 'emotional', 'bordering', 'sheer', 'stupidity', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'are', 'faced', 'horrific', 'situation', 'classic', 'example', 'blindness', 'rationality', 'when', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'basement', 'running', 'away', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Halloween', 'Reason', 'would', 'tell', 'one', 'not', 'let', 'be', 'backed', 'corner', 'situation', 'Saw', 'II', 'bit', 'different', 'victims', 'crew', 'Nostromo', 'Alien', 'are', 'already', 'trapped', 'seemingly', 'inescapable', 'enclosure', 'problem', 'not', 'physical', 'escape', 'solving', 'puzzle', 'cooperation', 'seven', 'prisoners.Business', 'trainers', 'hammer', 'constantly', 'importance', 'teamwork', 'accomplishing', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'born', 'intuition', 'never', 'played', 'team', 'sport', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'encountered', 'principle', 'mathematics', 'Shakespeare', 'French', 'classes', 'college', 'seven', 'prisoners', 'presented', 'puzzle', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'management', 'training', 'tell', 'need', 'cooperate', 'Their', 'captor', 'Jigsaw', 'straight', 'away', 'solution', 'escape', 'cooperation', 'two', 'hours', 'have', 'poison', 'gas', 'are', 'exposed', 'worst', 'course', 'next', '90', 'minutes', 'most', 'seven', 'die', 'off', 'largely', 'stupidity', 'fuelled', 'terror', 'selfishness', 'failure', 'imprisoned', 'principles', 'have', 'reason', 'overcome', 'fear', 'greed', 'one', 'two', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'movie', 'second', 'similar', 'theme', 'stupidity', 'police', 'primarily', 'principle', 'character', 'played', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'perp', 'saying', 'order', 'solve', 'puzzles.Much', 'credit', 'be', 'given', 'several', 'horrific', 'traps', 'tortures', 'perp', 'victims', 'Compared', 'perils', 'Jason', 'ax', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'chef', 'knife', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'deadly', 'kitty', 'toys', 'Aside', 'ingenious', 'conceptions', 'writers', 'excellent', 'realization', 'deadly', 'devices', 'safe', 'Hollywood', 'simulacra', 'not', 'single', 'clue', 'what', 'inevitable', 'mayhem', 'created', 'meeting', 'sharp', 'stainless', 'steel', 'unprotected', 'flesh', 'actually', 'done', 'plastic', 'cosmetic', 'appliances', 'director', 'commentary', 'clear', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'relatively', 'small', 'budget', 'writers', 'director', 'editor', 'put', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'whiz-bang', 'collages', 'rapidly', 'shifting', 'camera', 'rather', 'dwelling', 'careful', 'closeups', 'showing', 'realization', 'peril', 'rather', 'spending', 'time', 'screams', 'blood.While', 'puzzles', 'perils', 'booby', 'traps', 'threat', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'are', 'movie', 'strong', 'points', 'audience', 'frustration', 'blindness', 'reason', 'shown', 'vics', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'perp', 'motives', 'are', 'never', 'resolved', 'even', 'fully', 'explained', 'principle', 'character', 'despicable', 'person', 'reason', 'why', 'perp', 'rain', 'vengence', 'down', 'shoulders', 'especially', 'putting', 'lead', 'character', 'relatively', 'innocent', 'son', 'risk.Overall', 'story', 'line', 'sequel', 'richer', 'psychologically', 'more', 'interesting', 'first', 'are', 'bit', 'weak', 'story.If', 'horror', 'movies', 'will', 'certainly', 'one', 'Most', 'extras', 'are', 'relatively', 'ordinary', 'most', 'interesting', 'being', 'revelations', 'how', 'special', 'effects', 'teams', 'made', 'plastic', 'foam', 'fiber', 'optic', 'cable', 'look', 'hardwood', 'iron', 'stainless', 'steel', 'favorite', 'extra', 'director', 'commentary', 'almost', 'totally', 'psychologically', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'story', 'time', 'dwelling', 'problems', 'shooting', 'skill', 'actors', 'certain', 'situations.More', 'interesting', 'average', 'bloodfest', 'grounds', 'looking', 'forward', 'Saw', 'III']",Saw II

A sequel (obviously) but also in the way that the 2nd installment is much less subtle than the 1st with a more macho cast. A group of unfortunate victims are locked in a funhouse of traps and have to work together and think their way out of it. If they can just not fight among themselves they stand a chance, so what do they do?... they fight among themselves pretty much the whole time. Some actions of the characters are at times pretty silly like when the guy has to get in the oven (knowing about the &#34;trap&#34; nature of the house) he doesn't bother asking someone to hold the door open! This is a small criticism though as the film is on the whole great. The twists at the end needed to be as big as the ones in SAW, and they are.SAWll starts with the villain JIGSAW being caught by the cops but it's obvious that this is all part of his masterplan and we just know that he holds all the cards. The cops are under the illusion that they are in control but it soon becomes clear that everyone has to play, whether they want to or not.The various ways people die have been amped up since SAW. My personal favorite is the bladed hand trap. I did think &#34;why did you put your other hand in&#34; but still it was a good trap.SAWll nicely revisits scenes from SAW and is more of an extension to the SAW puzzle than a separate SAWll puzzle.The extras on this DVD are alright but theres not many of them. You get a short film on each of the traps - how they were made/ filmed etc. but thats it. I never watch commentary so I don't count that as relevant, but there is some.All in all a very good film.

Well the film 'Saw II' did just that, more of everything. But you know what? It worked beautifully!'Saw II' was successful in taking all the successful elements from the first film; expanding the cast, improving the effects, intensifying the psychological angst and physical gore while maintaining a strong narrative continuity with the original movie. Even more impressive was the manner in which they were able to have so many new things going on and still add psychological depth and breath to an already great protagonist (Jigsaw played by Tobin Bell).There are a lot of clever and unexpected twists and turns in this one that really leave an already strong storyline up to many more sequels to come!Almost forgot, I loved Shawnee Smith in the role of Amanda.",4,"""The Knowledge Of Death Changes Everything""",1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,1041,"['When', 'filming', 'sequels', 'strong', 'tendency', 'proceed', 'philosophy', 'more', 'better', 'More', 'gore', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'more', 'characters', 'jeopardy', 'etc', 'doing', 'so', 'one', 'risk', 'losing', 'intangible', 'element', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'success', 'Well', 'film', 'II', 'did', 'just', 'more', 'everything', 'know', 'what', 'worked', 'beautifully', 'II', 'was', 'successful', 'taking', 'successful', 'elements', 'first', 'film', 'expanding', 'cast', 'improving', 'effects', 'intensifying', 'psychological', 'angst', 'physical', 'gore', 'maintaining', 'strong', 'narrative', 'continuity', 'original', 'movie', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'was', 'manner', 'were', 'able', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'new', 'things', 'going', 'still', 'add', 'psychological', 'depth', 'breath', 'already', 'great', 'protagonist', 'Jigsaw', 'played', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'are', 'lot', 'clever', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'one', 'really', 'leave', 'already', 'strong', 'storyline', 'many', 'more', 'sequels', 'come', 'Almost', 'forgot', 'loved', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'role', 'Amanda']",Saw II
750450,A2K7CVIVEWDOVN,B00008YOD2,brian tunick,"[0, 0]","Spoiler if you haven't seen the first one...33 years ago, a young man named Wes Craven wrote and directed `The Last House on the Left', a horror movie so disturbing; it was banned in certain areas.  A film about the evil torture of the innocent and the innocent torturing the evil as a method of retribution.  I'm oversimplifying, and leaving out the parts where tools are used on human teeth, but that's the once-sentence story.  Two years ago, we got to see torture (very intricate, very disturbing) in a fairly well-written and entertaining movie, `Saw'.  This time around, we get to see elements of good vs. evil, as fought out with a furnace, syringes, etc.Anyone who saw the first knows there is a twist.  The `good' is ""Jigsaw"", the serial killer, who claims never to have murdered anyone.  As a terminal cancer patient, he `teaches' people who he feels are wasting the precious gift of life, by placing them in fatal positions where escape is possible.  This he considers a `game', and if you lose you die.  Winning usually involves some form of horrific self mutilation, so the home version of this game will probably not be out next Christmas.The movie does raise some interesting and inherent questions.  The obvious being `Is life wasted by drudging through the same routine day after day?' but going as far as `Should a child suffer for the sins of the father?'  These questions and many other are dealt with in grotesque and unimaginable ways, which left me both cringing and thinking (cringing more than thinking to be fair).The characters are somewhat forgettable, and highly unlikable.  In a life or death circumstance, they are unable to cooperate in even the simplest form.  Late in the film, we are given a reason why these people were chosen, and Jigsaw's prediction of this lack of cooperation, but it is a bit grating at times.In a line at the end of the film, Jigsaw says ""It's the last house on the left"", which strings some obvious, if not immediately apparent similarities, and serves as an unmistakable homage.This is not a movie for the faint of heart.  The young ones will be traumatized.  If you are extremely suggestible and slightly psychotic, do the rest of us a favor and skip this one.  And if you happen to live next door to James Wan, you might want to make a point of showing him just how much you enjoy and appreciate life.",4,It's the Last House on the Left...,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,2363,"['Spoiler', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'one', '33', 'years', 'ago', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'horror', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'was', 'banned', 'certain', 'areas', 'film', 'evil', 'torture', 'innocent', 'innocent', 'torturing', 'evil', 'method', 'retribution', ""'m"", 'oversimplifying', 'leaving', 'out', 'parts', 'where', 'tools', 'are', 'used', 'human', 'teeth', 'once-sentence', 'story', 'Two', 'years', 'ago', 'got', 'see', 'torture', 'very', 'intricate', 'very', 'disturbing', 'fairly', 'well-written', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Saw', 'time', 'around', 'get', 'see', 'elements', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'fought', 'out', 'furnace', 'syringes', 'etc.Anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'first', 'knows', 'twist', 'good', 'Jigsaw', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'never', 'have', 'murdered', 'anyone', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'patient', 'teaches', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'wasting', 'precious', 'gift', 'life', 'placing', 'fatal', 'positions', 'where', 'escape', 'possible', 'game', 'lose', 'die', 'Winning', 'usually', 'form', 'horrific', 'self', 'mutilation', 'home', 'version', 'game', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'out', 'next', 'Christmas.The', 'movie', 'raise', 'interesting', 'inherent', 'questions', 'obvious', 'being', 'life', 'wasted', 'drudging', 'same', 'routine', 'day', 'day', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'Should', 'child', 'suffer', 'sins', 'father', 'questions', 'many', 'other', 'are', 'dealt', 'grotesque', 'unimaginable', 'ways', 'left', 'cringing', 'thinking', 'cringing', 'more', 'thinking', 'be', 'fair', '.The', 'characters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'forgettable', 'highly', 'unlikable', 'life', 'death', 'circumstance', 'are', 'unable', 'cooperate', 'even', 'simplest', 'form', 'Late', 'film', 'are', 'given', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'were', 'chosen', 'Jigsaw', 'prediction', 'lack', 'cooperation', 'bit', 'grating', 'line', 'end', 'film', 'Jigsaw', 'last', 'house', 'left', 'obvious', 'not', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'similarities', 'unmistakable', 'homage.This', 'not', 'movie', 'faint', 'heart', 'young', 'ones', 'will', 'be', 'traumatized', 'are', 'extremely', 'suggestible', 'slightly', 'psychotic', 'do', 'rest', 'favor', 'skip', 'one', 'happen', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'James', 'Wan', 'might', 'want', 'make', 'point', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'life']",Saw II

Luster ""The Rook""","[0, 0]","I loved the suspense of the first ""Saw"" and was thrilled with it being more intent on keeping you guessing what would happen next, rather than spending the whole time hacking people up. The first movie was quite clever and the game and puzzles made sense. I even told friends and family it wasn't that gory, and it really wasn't. It was a true thriller. This movie on the other hand was more like all the other gorefest schlock. Afterall we start with not two people playing the game but no less than eight. Okay to get the ball rolling we first got to see a snitch have his head spiked by a mask before we find our group of victims in their cell.  Then right off without any delay or game drama we get to see one shot in the eye and his brains blown out. Not much longer we see another get burned up.All-in-all a bit of a disappointment from the first movie. Granted I never expected it to be as good as the first one, I just hoped it would follow the line of suspense over gore. It didn't. It joined the countless number of hack and slash movies with little story and lots of blood. Oh golly we get to see ""Jigsaw"" pass the sawblade to another. Such a thrill. NOT! Why did I give it three stars? It still has reasonably good acting, and some semblance of a story. So if you can stomach substancially more gore than the first movie, by all means rent it. I don't recommend this one for a purchase unless you are heavy into slasher movies.

This sequel had to happen, because Twisted Pictures and the powers that be in Hollywood had a Bloody cash cow on their hands with all the minions of teenagers who wouldn't know original material if it reached out and snatched the Abercrombie hoodie off their backs. Again, thanks to the power of free DVDs at the library I grabbed SAW deuce and watched it with an open mind and lots of coffee of course. I actually love Donnie Walberg, I have since he took the one side of his manly overalls and let them hang while dancing with New Kids on the Block, so he was a good surprise. The story line is a basic one gruesome murder, similar to the first movies MO, a detective, and more victims but instead of individual attention they are all stuck in one house and slowly being poisoned, they have to find keys to doors, and search for antidotes, and figure out why they are all there. The SECOND I saw friggin Lucy from 7th Heaven I giggled with glee because the thought of seeing that pie faced whiner get offed in some gory way was like an early birthday present unfortunately she just slowly expired from the poison. The first Saw, had a twist that I didn't see coming, this one, not so much. Bringing a previous victim in (Amanda), especially one who professed to be ""helped"" by Jigsaw in the first was its biggest mistake. I knew she was in on the whole thing the second she woke up. The tests for the victims were lame, and we only get to see 3 of them really: the oven, the needles and the clear box, none of them made me want to look away, which is the telltale sign your scaring me or grossing me out. By the end I seriously cared more about Amanda surviving knowing she was one of the bad guys, more than the kid and the detective, mainly because Donnie Walberg was such a sucky parent and a crooked cop, and the kid because he was really the innocent I knew wouldn't die, Jiggy doesn't work that way he is such a moral man. So Saw 3 is coming out soon, and we all know that Amanda is now the puppet master, what I want to see is her lock up one by one Paris and Lindsay and Nicole and Ashley and Jessica and Brittney, take away all their phones, miniature dogs, fake tans, hair bleach, plastic surgery and make them choose between 15 minutes more of fame or their looks.",3,Better than the first but not by much,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,2455,"['reviewed', 'first', 'Saw', 'movie', 'unearthed', 'what', 'was', 'amalgam', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'not', 'perfect', 'blend', 'more', 'serious', 'rip', 'off', 'sequel', 'had', 'happen', 'Twisted', 'Pictures', 'powers', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'Bloody', 'cash', 'cow', 'hands', 'minions', 'teenagers', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'original', 'material', 'reached', 'out', 'snatched', 'Abercrombie', 'hoodie', 'off', 'backs', 'Again', 'thanks', 'power', 'free', 'DVDs', 'library', 'grabbed', 'SAW', 'deuce', 'watched', 'open', 'mind', 'lots', 'coffee', 'course', 'actually', 'love', 'Donnie', 'Walberg', 'have', 'took', 'one', 'side', 'manly', 'overalls', 'let', 'hang', 'dancing', 'New', 'Kids', 'Block', 'was', 'good', 'surprise', 'story', 'line', 'basic', 'one', 'gruesome', 'murder', 'similar', 'first', 'movies', 'MO', 'detective', 'more', 'victims', 'instead', 'individual', 'attention', 'are', 'stuck', 'one', 'house', 'slowly', 'being', 'poisoned', 'have', 'find', 'keys', 'doors', 'search', 'antidotes', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'SECOND', 'saw', 'friggin', 'Lucy', '7th', 'Heaven', 'giggled', 'glee', 'thought', 'seeing', 'pie', 'faced', 'whiner', 'get', 'offed', 'gory', 'way', 'was', 'early', 'birthday', 'present', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'slowly', 'expired', 'poison', 'first', 'Saw', 'had', 'twist', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Bringing', 'previous', 'victim', 'Amanda', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'professed', 'be', 'helped', 'Jigsaw', 'first', 'was', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'knew', 'was', 'whole', 'thing', 'second', 'woke', 'up', 'tests', 'victims', 'were', 'lame', 'only', 'get', 'see', '3', 'really', 'oven', 'needles', 'clear', 'box', 'none', 'made', 'want', 'look', 'away', 'telltale', 'sign', 'scaring', 'grossing', 'end', 'seriously', 'cared', 'more', 'Amanda', 'surviving', 'knowing', 'was', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'more', 'kid', 'detective', 'mainly', 'Donnie', 'Walberg', 'was', 'such', 'sucky', 'parent', 'crooked', 'cop', 'kid', 'was', 'really', 'innocent', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'die', 'Jiggy', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'such', 'moral', 'man', 'So', 'Saw', '3', 'coming', 'out', 'soon', 'know', 'Amanda', 'now', 'puppet', 'master', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'lock', 'up', 'one', 'one', 'Paris', 'Lindsay', 'Nicole', 'Ashley', 'Jessica', 'Brittney', 'take', 'away', 'phones', 'miniature', 'dogs', 'fake', 'tans', 'hair', 'bleach', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'make', 'choose', '15', 'minutes', 'more', 'fame', 'looks']",Saw II

Entner ""The Great Etnebob""","[0, 0]","Being that it is Halloween I have decided to check out a few horror films, and since I already watched the first ""Saw"", I thought that I could continue on with the series, because the first one showed a lot of potential in the series. Unfortunatly ""Saw II"" did not continue to give me faith in the series.Saw 1 started out with 2 guys trapped in a room, and we followed thier back story to find out why they were there. The problem was interesting, and although it did not follow up on its true potential, it was interesting. The idea of a Killer, who never actually kills anybody, but makes them kill themselves was new and interesting, ""Saw II"" Forgot that.""Saw II"" Had about 8 or so people trapped in a house that is pumping a nerve gas into thier system, that if ingested for more than 2 hours would cause them to die. Throughout the house thier are traps and puzzles set up, that if done right will allow them to get an antidote to the gas, each trap set for an individual, for the crimes they have done to humanity, or themselves so that if they do survive they can better understand life.Meanwhile the father of one of the people in the house (who happens to be a cop) has actually caught Jigsaw, but things are not working out when Jigsaw shows him what is going on with his son.This sounds like it might be a fun movie. But its not. I don't care if there is an antidote somewhere in the house, if they don't know how to get it, and you pumped them full of poisin, THAT'S STILL MURDER. Also while the first one had many new ideas, this one is painfully pumped full of horror movie cliche's, that I am so damn sick of seeing. Like the survivor from the previous film, who because she survived him once before she is an expert on him. The tough guy jerk who doesn't care about saving anybody but himself. Their is no character development, just big walking stereotypes we have seen in every horror movie ever made. Oh, and I hate to give it away, but the black guy dies.Just like the original ""Saw"" it failed to live up to its own potential that it set up. We are led to believe that there are several traps throughout the house, each for an individual person. 8 people, we see 3, and one of them it isn't even explained who it was for. The ending for the most part was predictable. and again, nobody seems to care too much about the time limit until it is too late. They people have 2 hours and they open like 3 rooms in the house.

The originality of Saw pretty much guarantees that Saw II will be a letdown, if only because the most interesting twists have already been run. We know why Jigsaw does what he does. Even the twist ending isn't much of a twist, given the first one. Working out the connections between the players in his game is easier and less surprising because we're expecting connections.The connections are many, and new ones abound. Almost all of the players (with the exception of the detective father of one of the hostages) have been placed in a sealed house. They must solve a series of puzzles to survive, each one highlighting the sins of one or another of the victims. A room filled with dirty syringes faces an addict who spends her days shooting up with similar paraphenalia. The hot-head control freak must learn to resist the obvious red herrings.As hard as it would be to follow Saw, the fault lies with the filmmakers, too (their first mistake being trying to make a sequel, one that the director of the first movie, James Wan, didn't make). The puzzles are more interesting than the characters, and solving them is more the focus than the horrors they reveal. The first Saw forced us closer and closer to the characters, each secret revealed making our own sins more and more apparent. We were voyeurs looking in the mirror, to paraphrase Jigsaw. But here we are distanced from the victims; they're easy to dislike and dismiss--which would put us directly in Jigsaw's sights, but we don't really care because we really don't feel that they are us.It was a mistake, too, to give Jigsaw so much camera time. The more we see, the less mysterious and menacing he becomes.

I would hate to spoil this horror mystery for anyone interested.At the outset, we join a new victim of the Jigsaw killer shortly before his terror inducing, blood-pressure raising death. As in the first movie, a beaten and bloodied man awakens to his horror with a strange contraption attached to his neck. A close-up shows us his first person view of an open mask lined with what appears to be old nails. Loud noises, amplified breathing sound and cut shots accompany, I suppose to add tension and it does quite a good job of it. I found myself unintentionally squeezing my wife's knee harder and harder (happened many times during the movie). An old banged up TV abruptly turns on, as in the first movie, with the face of the goofy but creepy puppet slowly waxing into view. The subject is then informed by said puppet that unless he finds the key to his death mask within the allotted time, the spring mechanism will activate and...Well, you know. The TV screen then switches to a recording showing the subject unconscious on a table and a hooded man performing some sort of vivisection on the sleeping man in the area of his eyes. You then notice the blood crusting his right eye as his trembling hand reaches to feel the swollen socket, eye still intact. The voice-over puppet explains that since the subject in his daily life was an informant, that it only fitting that the key hidden behind the very thing he used to make his money. The following xray flashed on screen guarantees that the key is indeed behind his eye. That is when he finds the scalpel, and Mr. Puppet tells him to choose between his eye and his life. We are then treated to the wonderful visual feast that is a man attempting to cut out his own eye. This is mostly shown in close-up and I hope it doesn't ruin it for you knowing that he does manage to slice himself pretty good before giving up.If the scene I have just described disturbed you then I think the director accomplished what he set out to do. If it kinda' makes you nauseous, you may want to either bring a barf bag or don't go see it. For gods' sake, do not let your children go see it either. I think half of the people in the theater were under 18. This really isn't a movie for kids, or for most adults either. On the other hand, if you can separate movies from reality and just want to get a little adrenalin pumping for once at the movies, then this is definitely for you.I really cannot say much else about the plot without ruining it. Suffice it to say that the two main stories follow a police detective, old and worn out (played beautifully by Danny Walberg) and his son, a budding criminal. The son and his group of fellow captives struggle to find the antidote to a deadly nerve agent hidden somewhere in the booby-trapped house they the have awakened in. At the same time the father struggles to get the where-abouts of his son out of the captured ""Jigsaw"", the apparently infirm old man from the first movie. Many of the questions left from that movie are answered in an acceptable manner and if you've seen the first and even remotely enjoyed it then this is definitely for you.It is a great mystery and if you can figure out how everything went down before the surprise ending, then you my friend are a smarter man than I.

They scared the living hell out of everyone that watched it(some less so but oh well). What about films like Scream or Urban Legend or that Summer one? It was cool seeing WB stars getting chopped up. And now we have the latest batch of horror movies: out and out full-on gore movies. This film and it's prequel, Wolf Creek and Hostel were films with really quick editing and brutal gore. But personally that's not scary, it's just gross. Saw 2 doesn't change this, even though it's admittedly good concept is intact.The Jigsaw Killer is hard to describe as a murderer since he doesn't actually do it, his victims do. Being someone who ""saves people's lives"", he devises ways where people have to do something painful in order to escape. Most of them don't escape and that's where the gore comes in. It's a neat idea, although Seven used this in a way, it's just the filmmakers are a little frustrating in making a genuinely good horror movie.A detective finds out his son is locked in a room along with a couple others and their game is this: a nerve gas is in the house they're in and they have to find the antidote in 2 hours or they'll die. So we jump between 2 stories: the detective trying to solve it on his end and the unfortunate victims who might face their grisly ends.The film's central line is ""oh yes, there will be blood"" and it's a pretty spot-on tagline: gore is very rampant here, probably moreso than the original which you will always expect. ""Carnage candy"" as a kid in Scream 2 puts it but after awhile it kind of gets old, it's not as shocking anymore when the 4th one gets taken down in a grisly fashion and you don't feel disgusted anymore, at least I didn't. Sure it's gory but when we don't care about anyone living or dying, having someone die in a gory way is like ""ooh, that hurt"" rather than just being horrified.It is a film concept that can be so much more but unfortunately these films are just a way to kill people in grisly fashions and call it a horror movie.

Co-written by Leigh Whannell (Saw) and Darren Lynn Bousman, the latter also directing here, Saw II (2005) features once New Kid on the Block singer Donnie `Donnie D' Wahlberg (The Sixth Sense, Dreamcatcher), Tobin Bell (Mississippi Burning, Saw) and Shawnee Smith (Summer School, Who's Harry Crumb?), the last two actors both reprising their roles from the original film.  Also appearing is Franky G (Wonderland), Glenn Plummer (Showgirls, The Substitute), Dina Meyer (Dragonheart, Starship Troopers), Emmanuelle Vaugier (40 Days and 40 Nights), Erik Knudsen (Tribulation), and Beverley Mitchell (""7th Heaven"").After a killer opening sequence involving a half-nekkid man fitted with a particularly nasty piece of headgear, we meet police detective Eric Mathews (Wahlberg).  Seems Eric's life isn't going all that great...he's separated from his wife, his son Daniel (Knudsen) despises him, and his career has taken something akin to a nosedive straight into the porcelain (he now rides a desk)...and things are about to go from bad to worse, as the serial killer known as Jigsaw has taken a personal interest in Eric, so much so he engages Eric in a game, one that involves his son being trapped in a dilapidated house in an undisclosed location with a bunch of social miscreants (including Amanda, from the first film, played by Ms. Smith), slowly being poisoned by some type nerve gas, while all of their activities are being fed through surveillance cameras connected to monitors within Jigsaw's lair.  In order to counteract the poison, those in the house must participate in certain challenges, as successful completion allows access to an antidote, but if you've seen the first film, you'll know said challenges most definitely involve great sacrifice (usually of one's own body part).  As Eric and Jigsaw go back and forth (a good deal of Jigsaw's past is revealed), those in the house learn that they all have something in common, that is when they aren't getting something severed off in a devious trap or puking up blood due to prolonged exposure to the nerve gas.  As time runs out, the situation within the house takes a turn for the worse (one of the group decides it's a `only the strongest survive' type situation), and things aren't looking good for Eric's son, forcing Eric to use some `old school' information extraction methods on Jigsaw to find the location of the house.  Eric finally gets Jigsaw to come clean (sort of), but then again, given his penchant for elaborately planned scenarios, it could just all be a part of the game...First off let me just say this is one filthy, nasty, mean spirited horror film, loaded with disturbing imagery (that's about the dirtiest bathroom I've ever seen this side of the gas station down the street) and lots of blood and pain (and blood).  Is it the nastiest piece of work I've seen?  Not by a long shot, but it definitely holds it own.  I really enjoyed this movie, and I thought it was an excellent example of what a sequel should be for this type of film, one that not only expands on the original, but also reveals a good deal of information with regards to the main, connecting character, that being Jigsaw, played most excellently by Tobin Bell.  We learn his name, his past, and the motivation behind why he does what he does...and I have to say, in listening to him, his reasoning doesn't seem all that far-fetched, as many people do take that which is most precious to them, their lives, for granted, not fully appreciating what they have until they're forced to face their own mortality (having your head stuck in a bear trap set to a timer will certainly go far in helping you reevaluate your life choices).  But then again, it is our unalienable right to disregard our gifts and live a life of slovenly leisure should we choose to do so...but I digress.  As far as the performances go, I thought most did well enough (I found Eric's son to be an annoying little prat) considering there wasn't really enough time to spend on any one character given the number of them running around combined with the film's seemingly short running time (it says 93 minutes, but it felt more like about an hour and twenty minutes).  The real fun here is the various traps, as Jigsaw continues his grand, social experimentation, `testing the fabric of human nature'...the opening sequence, featuring a vicious head trap (slightly different than the one featured in the first film), is worth it alone for seeing this film, as it's about the most tense five minutes I've spent with a movie in a while.  If'n you're squeamish about needles, you've got a real treat in store for you here...also, that suspended hand trapping device was particularly nasty, although I have to say, the person who fell for it was none to bright.  Seemed to me a normal person would have figured out the danger after putting one hand in, and would have opted against inserting the second, but, when you're doped up silly on nerve gas, who's to say what one might do?  As far as the direction of the film, Darren Lynn Bousman doesn't seem to have the overall smooth finesse of James Wan (who directed the first film), but he definitely knows what he's doing, and he does it very well (what's really impressive is this was his first, big feature).  Bousman keeps things moving along at a frantic pace, barely allowing for one to catch one's breath.  My only real misgiving about this film was at the end...there's a decent revelation that comes about, followed by an overly lengthy recap sequence where we get to rewatch all the stinking clues dropped throughout the film, perhaps in an effort to strengthen (or help explain) the revelation itself.  This isn't an uncommon device, one that I feel sort of suggests the filmmaker feels their audiences are none too bright.  Problem is here (for me, at least), it wasn't really necessary, was way too long, and served only to eat up screen time.  All in all, if you liked the first one, then you'll most likely dig this follow up.The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1), looks excellent, and the audio, available in both Dolby 2.0 Surround and 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX Plus comes through perfectly.  As far as extras, there's a audio commentary track with director Darren Lynn Bousman and actors Donnie Wahlberg and Beverley Mitchell, three featurettes titled `Bits and Pieces - The Props of Jigsaw' (4:35), `Jigsaw's Game' (2:58), and `The Traps of Saw II', which is made up of four parts, each discussing a particular trap.  Also included are storyboards and a conceptual art gallery, English and Spanish subtitles, a theatrical trailer for the film, along with advertisements/trailers for other Lion's Gate DVD releases like the special edition Saw 2 DVD set, Three... Extremes (2004), Audition (1999), Ultimate Avengers (2006), and Tamara (2005).Cookieman108By the way, seems Darren Lynn Bousman is busy working on Saw III, scheduled for a 2006 release, probably

When I first saw Saw I was convinced there would never be another film like it, and so far that's true because Saw II is in now way a carbon copy of it's predesesor.  I also said there would never be another horror film to top it.  I was wrong because it's sequel, in one of those never heard of strokes of genious has actually exceeded all expectations and become a better scare ride, a better film than Saw.  I guess the reason to me this film rose above is that the premise allows for a much tenser ride.  The fact that there is a group of strangers trapped in a house full of traps for them with every turn causes this uneasy air to come over the veiwer.  I will say that even though you don't have to have seen Saw to appreciate Saw II, it does help...a lot.  That said, the premise is this...The Jigsaw is at it again.  The opening scene is as chilling as they come and sets the tone for this thrill ride.  Donny, Marky-Marks brother plays a cop whose son is part of the jigsaws new experiment.  Trapped in a house with a bunch of ex-cons, the house full of nerve gas that will kill them all in 2 hours time, this 15 year old kid or so has to try and survive amidst a group of crackheads and killers.  There are antidotes hidden throughout the house, the only problem is these antidotes are guarded by deadly traps and games including a key hidden in a pit of syringes and a furnice.  The deaths are intence and the overall feel of the film is edge of your seat intesity.

750471,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00008YOD2,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[4, 5]","As a Christian I always find it funny when people accuse me of legalism, and  hypocrisy.  For don't we live in a world where everybody expects everybody to do and act the way we want them too?  Don't we all at some point ostracize people for being a little off o r out of place?  The freaks call the beautiful stuck up, and the beautiful pay no attention to the ugly.  We flip off the guy who cuts us off and we hate him because he inconvenienced us for one small moment.  We're all guilty of doing somebody wrong, and then when we are wronged we expect the other person to apologize.  We want vengeance, and we want the world to think and act just like us.  If not we hate them.  Trust me we're all guilty at some point, even I amThat is just one of the wild thoughts that permeated my mind while sitting through SAW II. Yes, I'll admit it's odd that I would have a somewhat religious epiphany while people are hacking themselves to pieces.  But that's the beauty of Horror.  It's about processing the horror into something productive, while enjoying the scares.The Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bond) is back.  This time he's locked a bunch of people in a gory fun-ouse of his own design.  The house is slowly filling with a gas that will kill the inhabitants unless they can find the antidote.  One of the Jigsaw Killers victims is the son of Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), a local cop.  Matthews and the local swat team have the Jigsaw Killer in their grasp.  What follows is  a psychological game that matches the law with a man whose unafraid to die.SAW II is one of those rare sequels that works because you get to find out more about the psychopath.  In this film we get to delve into the mind of the Jigsaw Killer (who goes by the name of John), see a little more about why and how he operates.  Tobin Bond keeps him creepy and yet charismatic enough to be believable.  Like a poor mans Hannibal Lecter there is a method and meaning to his madness but he's not a cartoon.  He's a man on his deathbed with nothing to lose, and a theory of life that is so practical that if he channeled his concepts into motivational speaking and not murder and carnage he could be a millionaire.I liked that the movie didn't play fast and loose with the carnage and at the same time realized when enough was enough.  In this PG-13 Horror movie world it's so easy to pull back to reach a younger audience.  But SAW II is smart enough to raise the bar, and let you process the mystery.  Whose holding the cards?  Is it the Jigsaw Killer?  Is it the cops?I also thought the ensemble in the house worked well together, I just wish the screenplay had given them more to do than just stumble around and scream at each other.  I also thought the stunning revelation about ""X marking the spot"" came far to late for the characters to really care about who was in the picture.  When your life is almost over you're not really worrying about who put you in jail.Director Darren Lynn Bousman tries his dandiest not to make the same mistakes of the first film, by laying off the camera tricks in favor actually allowing the actors to act.  Sure he wiggles the camera around a little, adds some quick cuts to places.  But he doesn't use those devices to amplify action that's boring.  My one little qualm was with the screenplay.  I liked the stuff in the house so much more than the police procedural parts.  I wished that the movie had delved into the whole numbers thing and the mysteries of the people in the house a little more.SAW II is engrossing if you let it be.  On the surface it could be construed as just another slasher knock-off.  But the power lies in the Jigsaw character and how and why he's manipulating the background.  It's also a film that explores our own dark side.  Jigsaw's real beef with the people in the story is that their wasting their lives.  Their killing their bodies, they're hurting other, and their tearing their families apart.

750473,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00008YOD2,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[3, 4]","""Saw II"" slaps us on the torture rack, then tightens the screws until every last gasp, shiver and shriek has been squeezed right out of us.Just when we think we've endured enough cruel and unusual punishment, director and co-writer Darren Lynn Bousman takes it up a notch with the zeal of a modern-day Marquis de Sade.That this first-time director performs this evisceration of our nerves, and does it so well, will likely touch off even more concerns about the extreme violence in today's movies. As it should, really.But, for the tough-as-Leatherface horror crowd who want to be bruised and battered by their entertainment, ""Saw II"" represents a cut above in the genre.The sequel to last year's sleeper Halloween hit wastes no time reintroducing us to the grisly handiwork of Jigsaw, a terminally ill serial killer hell-bent on testing people who have made messes of their lives.In the first ""Saw,"" Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell played two unlucky guys who wake up to find themselves chained in a dirty subterranean room, with a saw as their only means of escape. The scrappy first film had an estimated budget of $1.2 million, and went on to make more than $55 million during its theatrical run. It's been reviled, praised and rabidly discussed on the Internet.""Saw"" had a shocker of an ending, an original villain and a delightful scream-queen performance from used-to-be golden boy Elwes (""The Princess Bride"").In the sequel, conceived right after the first struck a box-office jugular, the cheap thrills remain, but the surprises are mostly gone. There are a few good twists in ""Saw II,"" but none that rivals the pop-up corpse shocker from the original.As in the original, Jigsaw uses a puppet as an alter ego to let the cops know why he's punishing sinners unappreciative of what life has given them. A warped medieval mentality runs homicidally through ""Saw II"" as ""screw-ups"" are flambeed, thrown into a pit of hypodermic needles and clubbed on the head with a spiked bat.For the sequel, Bousman and co-writer Whannell up the body count, stranding eight victims in a booby-trapped house that looks like Freddy Krueger was its interior decorator. The eight must figure out how to get at an antidote before poison gas pumped into the vents does them in. Among those trapped inside is the son of a burnt-out detective, Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg of the defunct ""Boomtown"" TV show).Of the new victims, the quick-fused Franky G. gives the meanest and most capable performance. Others seem to be standard horror bait.""Saw II"" is a tighter, more focused film than its predecessor. But even though this sequel is well-made, it lacks the over-the-top campiness of the first movie.What ""Saw II"" needs is a wailing and moaning Elwes to make us snicker when the bloodletting is just too much to handle. In ""Saw II,"" everyone is deadly serious about the carnage, which makes the film effective, but also unshakably disturbing.",3,More 'open' than the first,1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,2935,"['Saw', 'II', 'torture', 'rack', 'then', 'screws', 'last', 'gasp', 'shiver', 'shriek', 'been', 'squeezed', 'right', 'us.Just', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'endured', 'enough', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'punishment', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'up', 'notch', 'zeal', 'modern-day', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade.That', 'first-time', 'director', 'performs', 'evisceration', 'nerves', 'so', 'well', 'will', 'likely', 'touch', 'off', 'even', 'more', 'concerns', 'extreme', 'violence', 'today', 'movies', 'should', 'really.But', 'tough-as-Leatherface', 'horror', 'crowd', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'bruised', 'battered', 'entertainment', 'Saw', 'II', 'cut', 'genre.The', 'sequel', 'last', 'year', 'sleeper', 'Halloween', 'hit', 'time', 'reintroducing', 'grisly', 'handiwork', 'Jigsaw', 'terminally', 'ill', 'serial', 'killer', 'hell-bent', 'testing', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'messes', 'lives.In', 'first', 'Saw', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'co-writer', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'played', 'two', 'unlucky', 'guys', 'who', 'wake', 'up', 'find', 'chained', 'dirty', 'subterranean', 'room', 'saw', 'only', 'means', 'escape', 'scrappy', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'estimated', 'budget', '1.2', 'million', 'went', 'make', 'more', '55', 'million', 'theatrical', 'run', 'been', 'reviled', 'praised', 'rabidly', 'discussed', 'Internet', 'Saw', 'had', 'shocker', 'ending', 'original', 'villain', 'delightful', 'scream-queen', 'performance', 'used-to-be', 'golden', 'boy', 'Elwes', 'Princess', 'Bride', '.In', 'sequel', 'conceived', 'right', 'first', 'struck', 'box-office', 'jugular', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'remain', 'surprises', 'are', 'mostly', 'gone', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'twists', 'Saw', 'II', 'none', 'pop-up', 'corpse', 'shocker', 'original.As', 'original', 'Jigsaw', 'puppet', 'alter', 'ego', 'let', 'cops', 'know', 'why', 'punishing', 'sinners', 'unappreciative', 'what', 'life', 'given', 'warped', 'medieval', 'mentality', 'homicidally', 'Saw', 'II', 'screw-ups', 'are', 'flambeed', 'thrown', 'pit', 'hypodermic', 'needles', 'clubbed', 'head', 'spiked', 'sequel', 'Bousman', 'co-writer', 'Whannell', 'body', 'count', 'stranding', 'eight', 'victims', 'booby-trapped', 'house', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'was', 'interior', 'decorator', 'eight', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'antidote', 'poison', 'gas', 'pumped', 'vents', 'trapped', 'inside', 'son', 'burnt-out', 'detective', 'Eric', 'Mathews', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'defunct', 'Boomtown', 'TV', 'show', 'new', 'victims', 'quick-fused', 'Franky', 'G.', 'meanest', 'most', 'capable', 'performance', 'Others', 'seem', 'be', 'standard', 'horror', 'bait', 'Saw', 'II', 'tighter', 'more', 'focused', 'film', 'predecessor', 'even', 'sequel', 'well-made', 'over-the-top', 'campiness', 'first', 'movie.What', 'Saw', 'II', 'wailing', 'moaning', 'Elwes', 'make', 'snicker', 'when', 'bloodletting', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'Saw', 'II', 'everyone', 'deadly', 'serious', 'carnage', 'film', 'effective', 'also', 'unshakably', 'disturbing']",Saw II

750477,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00008YOD2,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[3, 4]","- REVIEWLast year, film critic/journalist Richard Roeper said, in a negative remark, that the first ""SAW"" was a glorified Snuff film.  Now, if he were to say the same thing in ""SAW II"", I would actually agree with him.  I don't mean to offend to the fans, because I was one of the people that LOVED the first movie.  I wasn't completely anticipated for the sequel, because, like every other horror sequel in the making, everything about this films screams out 'MORE': more blood, more body count, more yelling, and more of those N.I.N.-style cinematography; all more...of the similar stuff I've seen from the last film.  The only reason I felt to see this film is because I used the ""FREE SAW 2"" movie ticket when I bought the ""SAW Uncut"" DVD.As far as horror sequels go, this movie was a little better than I expected, and it could've gotten a lot worse.  It's been exactly a year since I've seen the first ""SAW"" and a couple months for ""SAW II"" since the last film too place, and now the movie got a NKOTB member to take care of the job.  Donnie Wahlberg plays a detective on a case to find the Jigsaw killer after his informant recently was ""played"" by one of Jigsaw's games.  For those who've seen the first film, we all known the twist of who the Jigsaw killer really is, and it didn't take long for the detective and his crew to find his hideout.  Unfortunately for the detective, the Jigsaw killer, aka John (Tobin Bell), already has another game set up for another set of victims, one of which is the detective's son.  It's unusual in a way that John, who really is weak by a Terminal Cancer, would still have the strength to acquire the victims; is there someone else involved?Anyway, the eight victims of the game are being locked up in a mansion filled with a deadly nerve gas that would kill them in two hours if they don't find the antidotes found in deadly places.  Frankie G's character (wait, wasn't he in ""Jonny Zero?"") ain't too happy about his sitch and doesn't mind expressing his rage at somebody; of course, any guy whose the star of a show that was cancelled after five episodes has a good reason to be angry.  One of the surprising victims in the game is Amanda, who was the only survivor of one of the Jigsaw's games, who's back to play his game once again; what purpose does she have of being here?These two and the rest (including a token) need to cooperate in order to survive his game, but knowing horror films, that's never gonna happen, and during moments of devastation, they'll kill each other in order to survive (reminds me of ""Battle Royale"").  It's a time of survival for the group, and for the detective who uses his inner ""Badboy Donny"" to coerce the Jigsaw to help him find the victims, but he has no idea that the Jigsaw is setting up another game for him.As far as the story goes, it has all the set up for a ""Saw"" film, and is equally disturbing albeit not scary.  The reason I liked ""SAW"" was the atmospheric intensity of being part of the game, and knowing the feeling of it by the end of the movie.  Other than the first game in the beginning of ""Saw II"", I didn't feel any of that during the rest of the film, and I didn't really care of what happens to the characters.  It's probably that I've always experienced this experience before, but as I watch them get killed off one by one, there's no morbid reaction about it, as it becomes all about the gore and none of the heart-pounding situations.  (Plus, the attractive female victims get killed off less graphically than the men; strange)Acting-wise, well, let's just saying that most of the actors' constant yelling helps their over-acting by 75%; not even Donnie's ""you can kiss this"" attitude helps him out that much.  I'm just glad Tobin Bell is the only actor that can pull off such a good role as a cancerous psychopath.  Boy, do I miss Cary Elwes already.The best thing about the sequel is it's own twist ending.  Yes, y'all, the second ""Saw"" has ANOTHER unexpected twist for the franchise, and let me tell you, it all makes sense.  The twist filled in almost all of the gaps that some people find it implausible from the last movie, not to mention adding a homage to the first film.  Although, there IS one plot inconsistancy because of the twist.  I can't tell you what it is without spoiling it, but it has something to do with the nerve gas.  I can tell there's gonna be a ""SAW III"" in the making, along with another twist...maybe.Even with the unexpected twist, I felt this eerie aura of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu surrounding me.  Plot-wise, it was slighty superior than the original, but without the shock and ghastly mood that made the first film conceptually awesome, ""Saw II"" just drags itself as it becomes annoying than it is creepy.  But then again, this IS a horror sequel, so it's no surprise that it couldn't live up to to my cult favorite. In a formal way of speaking, I was delighted with the film, but not satisfied.This is Del Keyes, saying ""SAW it once, don't feel like seeing it again.""",3,"It's a new jigSAW game, but it's all the

It is.INTRO: The original Saw was quite a horror movie. It told about a killer who would put his victims in deadly situations, and they had to figure out how to get out.The ending was quite a cliffhanger, so we KNEW there would be a sequel. And now we have it. And the sequel rocks!THE STORY: This takes a few months after the first. Det.  Mathews has found Jigsaw and it seems that it will end swell. But Jigsaw reveals that he has Mathews's son in one of his games. The son, along with other people, are trapped in a house filled with nerve gas. They will have to find antidotes to the nerve gas while avoiding traps to survive. Can Mathews find where Jiggy's ""game"" is? Can Mathews's son survive?OPINION: What a great horror ride! Suspense, horror, and tons of blood! What I liked about this film is that it goes back to the roots of horror. With all the PG-13 horror movies out, it's nice to see an R-rated one for once. Plus, the ending has a HUGE twist.If you liked the original, you'll love Saw II!Oh, and BTW, this film has made over $30 million on it's opening weekend.

Sequels are always a bad idea, especially when you're up against something as brilliant as the original Saw.  Let's face it.  This is a premise with severely limited room for expansion.  The first Saw was a beautifully wretched and gruesome concept that was played out great on film.  But this sequel didn't have much of a chance of matching the sweet bloody ambiance of its pedecessor.  Like most sequels, since the premise of the movie was explained during the plot of the original flick, the writers don't feel the need to weigh down part II with a storyline.  They just set the villian out in public again and have him wreek havoc and spill more blood with greater special effects than the first.  And as always, it makes the sequel an insult to the original and a basic disappointment.  They didn't even try to stand up to the original with this movie.  The plot about all the people locked in a house with nerve gas was just so weak and contrived!!  What was Lee W. thinking when he did this???  It was an okay movie over all.  Blood, carnage and special effects are always fun to a point...but for the most part, this movie was the average expectation of a sequel...trying too hard to live off the name of the original, not bothering with a movie as long as we can depend on special effects.  They really rushed through making a sequel before they had a real movie in mind.  As much as I love carnage, I hate the obvious cheap capitalism displayed in this quick knock-off.

750484,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00008YOD2,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 1]","Saw 2 is a sequal that worked for the most part in my opinion.  It stays true to the Saw theme by still asking if you are grateful to be alive, and asking how much blood you are willing to shed to stay alive once you are in a life or death situation (or game, as Jigsaw calls it).  The games (or traps some may like to call them too) are more played out in this sequal, where as we only got to see glimpses in the first Saw.  The main scenario is on a larger scale, played out in an old house with a group of people, as compared to the two men in a large bathroom in the first movie.  A nice connection is made with the first movie (in addition to story elements) which brings some of the people into the same bathroom once again near the movie's end.  There is also that unexpected surprise to the story that made probably the biggest impact (in my opinion) with the first Saw.  Again, you couldn't quite see this one coming either, but it didn't have quite the satisfying and felt impact as the first Saw.Tobin Bell is Jigsaw, and gets a lot more screen time in Saw 2, we even actually see his face quite a bit.  More light is shed about who he is, where he's come from, and why he does what he does with these sick little games.  The man has a point, but the scenarios he creates are so brutal its nearly impossible to see it as fear and panic take over.  This is the case with detective Mathews (Donnie Whalberg) who is the main character in Saw 2, and whom the main game's focus is around.  You got a house full of young men and woman (including Mathews son) trying to stay alive, playing one brutal game after another, but the bigger picture is Mathews and the game he is playing right in front of Jigsaw.  The rules are laid out for Mathews, but they are so wrapped up in the fear and panic that it is impossible for him to see and that's when things begin to unfold and the surprise ending is told.While disturbing and difficult to watch at times, Saw 2 doesn't have quite the impact as the original.  There is plenty of blood, gore and violence, and one of the guys named Xavier (Franky G) becomes the scariest guy in the movie when he is driven to do whatever he feels he must to stay alive in that house.  There are more traps and possible the most frightening was the very first of the movie, even before things get rolling we see a man who has had the key to unlocking his trap surgically inserted under his eye.  He has 60 seconds to dig it out with a little knife.  Not a very bloody scene at all, but just the thought of what must be done to survive is gut wrenching enough.  On a good note, things move along in Saw 2, going from one trap/test to the next, while the first Saw was a bit more laid back, with the two men in the bathroom talking things out in grave details and referring to flashbacks to piece the puzzle together, however I believe it was those moments that created more tension and fright when the bloodshed and panic occured, resulting in more of a felt impact in regard to those in Saw 2.Saw 2 works for what it is, by carrying on the Saw theme, expanding on the scenarios (and some gore if that's your thing) and exploring Jigsaw's background a little more.  I don't think it's quite as sharp as the original, but it improves in various areas and falls in others.Acting - 4Characters - 4Horror/Gore - 4.5Story - 4Overall - 4",4,You gotta play by the rules,1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,3361,"['Saw', '2', 'sequal', 'worked', 'most', 'part', 'opinion', 'true', 'Saw', 'theme', 'still', 'asking', 'are', 'grateful', 'be', 'alive', 'asking', 'how', 'much', 'blood', 'are', 'willing', 'shed', 'stay', 'alive', 'are', 'life', 'death', 'situation', 'game', 'Jigsaw', 'games', 'traps', 'may', 'like', 'call', 'too', 'are', 'more', 'played', 'out', 'sequal', 'where', 'only', 'got', 'see', 'glimpses', 'first', 'Saw', 'main', 'scenario', 'larger', 'scale', 'played', 'out', 'old', 'house', 'group', 'people', 'compared', 'two', 'men', 'large', 'bathroom', 'first', 'movie', 'nice', 'connection', 'made', 'first', 'movie', 'addition', 'story', 'elements', 'people', 'same', 'bathroom', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'end', 'also', 'that', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'story', 'made', 'probably', 'biggest', 'impact', 'opinion', 'first', 'Saw', 'Again', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'either', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'felt', 'impact', 'first', 'Saw.Tobin', 'Bell', 'Jigsaw', 'lot', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Saw', '2', 'even', 'actually', 'see', 'face', 'quite', 'bit', 'More', 'light', 'shed', 'who', 'where', 'come', 'why', 'what', 'sick', 'little', 'games', 'man', 'point', 'scenarios', 'are', 'so', 'brutal', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'see', 'fear', 'panic', 'take', 'case', 'detective', 'Mathews', 'Donnie', 'Whalberg', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'Saw', '2', 'whom', 'main', 'game', 'focus', 'around', 'got', 'house', 'full', 'young', 'men', 'woman', 'including', 'Mathews', 'son', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'playing', 'one', 'brutal', 'game', 'bigger', 'picture', 'Mathews', 'game', 'playing', 'right', 'front', 'Jigsaw', 'rules', 'are', 'laid', 'out', 'Mathews', 'are', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'fear', 'panic', 'impossible', 'see', 'when', 'things', 'begin', 'unfold', 'surprise', 'ending', 'told.While', 'disturbing', 'difficult', 'watch', 'times', 'Saw', '2', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'impact', 'original', 'plenty', 'blood', 'gore', 'violence', 'one', 'guys', 'named', 'Xavier', 'Franky', 'G', 'scariest', 'guy', 'movie', 'when', 'driven', 'do', 'whatever', 'must', 'stay', 'alive', 'house', 'are', 'more', 'traps', 'possible', 'most', 'frightening', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'movie', 'even', 'things', 'get', 'rolling', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'key', 'unlocking', 'trap', 'surgically', 'inserted', 'eye', '60', 'seconds', 'dig', 'out', 'little', 'knife', 'Not', 'very', 'bloody', 'scene', 'just', 'thought', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'survive', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'enough', 'good', 'note', 'things', 'move', 'along', 'Saw', '2', 'going', 'one', 'trap/test', 'next', 'first', 'Saw', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'laid', 'back', 'two', 'men', 'bathroom', 'talking', 'things', 'out', 'grave', 'details', 'referring', 'flashbacks', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'together', 'however', 'believe', 'was', 'moments', 'created', 'more', 'tension', 'fright', 'when', 'bloodshed', 'panic', 'occured', 'resulting', 'more', 'felt', 'impact', 'regard', 'Saw', '2.Saw', '2', 'works', 'what', 'carrying', 'Saw', 'theme', 'expanding', 'scenarios', 'gore', 'thing', 'exploring', 'Jigsaw', 'background', 'little', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', 'as', 'sharp', 'original', 'various', 'areas', 'falls', 'others.Acting', '4Characters', '4Horror/Gore', '4.5Story', '4Overall', '4']",Saw II

Day ""ENIGMA""","[0, 0]","Let me first start by saying that all in all this was a pretty good movie; and all things considered i probably would have loved it, save for the fact that I've already seen this movie before when it was called 'CUBE' (a movie on DVD about a bunch of strangers put into a maze filled with traps, where they have a small amount of time to escape before they die, and to make things worse.. one of the people with them is slowly turning into a murderous psychopath... oh and i forgot, the exit of both movies is found in a sequence of hidden numbers).Anyway, in SAW II you are taken on yet another venture into the sadistic sociopathic mind of John 'The Jigsaw Killer' and we get to see small bits behind the mind of the madman (check out [...] for a brief cartoon about how he became what he is today). One of the low points in this movie that i enjoyed more in the first was there was a great deal more character development in the prisoners than there was in this movie, and if you pay real close attention (check to see who isn't coughing up blood in the house and ask yourself why) you might just be able to piece together the shocking ending.Now a brief note to the members of LIONS GATE and Twisted Pictures..... OK we the many Fans of SAW get the picture... Yea Yea we all waste moments in out lives and probably deserve a good kick in the can for it..... I mean heck i probably should be out feeding orphan kittens right now rather than writing this review right? We get the idea now here's a few for you...Either take this franchise in another direction, end it here in SAW II or end it in a trilogy. I mean the 'we aren't grateful for our lives thing' can only stay fresh for so long.  I mean in SAW III Jigsaw could put a whole city to a test of life or death to save themselves after pumping poison in the water supply. Or maybe someone can give him a taste of his own medicine putting him to the test in a challenge where the prize would be the cure to cancer.

First, half of Jigsaw's victims are just plain annoying. You've got your typical dumb and whiny chicks, and your typical arrogant jerk. You even got a young teenager, who is probably the most annoying one out of all of them. And he doesn't even talk that much! Second, this film also has your standard detective plot thread. Jigsaw is typically found and interrogated (like you've never seen THAT before in the detective genre), and the detectives themselves look like obvious cardboard cutouts. The good news is those are the only flaws I can find in this film, I think. The traps are far more inventive than the ones in the original, and while they didn't freak me out, they are still disturbing to look at. We get to know a little more about Jigsaw and why he makes his victims play his little ""games."" He's probably one of the creepiest villains in the horror genre.If you loved the first Saw, then you would probably love this one as well if you don't mind the flaws.

But what is Saw if it didn't have any of that in the film?What makes this movie so great is that this gives a story to who the Jigsaw Killer really is. In the first film, he is rarely seen and portrayed as some kind of monster. In this film, he is on almost the entire time giving his story and it makes him more human and actually a little sympathetic. That's the basic idea of the film, people trying to escape Jigsaw's game is only a minor side story and not a major plot like in the original. This story is really made just to tell you a little bit about who Jigsaw really is.Those people who had to solve a puzzle to live had an easy one to solve to the viewing audience. I figured out the answer fifteen mintues into the film, but it didn't hurt my enjoyment of the film. It's one of those things that if you don't figure it out by the end, you slap your forehead for not knowing how obvious it was saying ""Of course!""The actors do a great job. Tobin Bell really shines in the film since he finally has a lot of speaking parts in the film. He makes the character very convincing, intellegent and like I said before, actually sympethetic to the point you kind of feel sorry for him.So overall, if you liked the first film, you will also like this one. Knowing Jigsaw more and seeing his human side is worth it alone, it puts a face on the character. But, I don't feel it is better than the first movie. Some of the things in this film were typical and not really original or rarely seen like what was in the first movie.

Not content to rest on the mayhem he created in the first film, Jigsaw is back kidnapping those he deems unworthy of life, and forcing them to earn their lives back in a series of brutal and bizarre games, where death is all to often the result.The sequel picks up shortly after the events of the first film where Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is investigating yet another victim. The fact that the victim is missing a puzzle shaped piece of skin leaves no doubt as to who is behind this killing, and Matthews and his task force set up their efforts to stop the killer before he can strike again.A sudden inspiration leads Matthews and his team to a factory where they soon discover Jigsaw amongst all of his toys and traps. The frail Jigsaw is dying from a terminal illness, and he reveals to Matthews that he has a game underway, one where a group of people are trapped in a remote house filled with traps that are also filling up with a deadly gas. Only those who can survive the traps and decipher the clues will be able to locate the antidotes and survive the mayhem.Matthews is even more determined to find the locale of the house as his son is one of the individuals trapped inside slowly dying from the poison. Matthews and his team can see what is happening in the house via a video monitor and while the team attempts to determine the location and save the individuals, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), plays a dangerous game with Matthews as he attempts to interrogate him for information.The film moves back and forth from the interrogation to the individuals trapped in the house and keeps the tension going. While not as claustrophobic or as gory as the original, ""Saw 2""benefits from an interesting premise and a rousing finale that sets the stages for the pending ""Saw 3"". Some may find a bit of issue with the pacing as it does not contain as the tension and scares are scarcer than they are in the first release.Solid performances throughout makes ""Saw 2"" a cut above most horror films and is not to be missed by fans of the original.Bonus Materials IncludeCommentary with director Darren Lynn Bousman, Donnie Wahlberg and Beverley MitchellJigsaw's Game Making-of FeaturetteBits and Pieces: The Props of Saw IIBits and Pieces: The Traps of Saw IIFeaturettesStoryboards4 stars out of 5Gareth Von Kallenbach",4,A solid follow up to the horror classic.,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,2477,"['diabolic', 'Jigsaw', 'back', 'follow', 'up', 'smash', 'Saw', 'came', 'nowhere', 'become', 'one', 'biggest', 'grossing', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'Not', 'content', 'rest', 'mayhem', 'created', 'first', 'film', 'Jigsaw', 'back', 'kidnapping', 'unworthy', 'life', 'forcing', 'earn', 'lives', 'back', 'series', 'brutal', 'bizarre', 'games', 'where', 'death', 'often', 'result.The', 'sequel', 'up', 'shortly', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'where', 'Detective', 'Eric', 'Matthews', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'investigating', 'yet', 'victim', 'fact', 'victim', 'missing', 'puzzle', 'shaped', 'piece', 'skin', 'doubt', 'who', 'killing', 'Matthews', 'task', 'force', 'set', 'up', 'efforts', 'stop', 'killer', 'can', 'strike', 'again.A', 'sudden', 'inspiration', 'Matthews', 'team', 'factory', 'where', 'soon', 'discover', 'Jigsaw', 'toys', 'traps', 'frail', 'Jigsaw', 'dying', 'terminal', 'illness', 'Matthews', 'game', 'underway', 'one', 'where', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'trapped', 'remote', 'house', 'filled', 'traps', 'are', 'also', 'filling', 'up', 'deadly', 'gas', 'Only', 'who', 'can', 'survive', 'traps', 'clues', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'locate', 'antidotes', 'survive', 'mayhem.Matthews', 'even', 'more', 'determined', 'find', 'locale', 'house', 'son', 'one', 'individuals', 'trapped', 'slowly', 'dying', 'poison', 'Matthews', 'team', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'house', 'video', 'monitor', 'team', 'attempts', 'determine', 'location', 'save', 'individuals', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'dangerous', 'game', 'Matthews', 'interrogate', 'information.The', 'film', 'moves', 'back', 'forth', 'interrogation', 'individuals', 'trapped', 'house', 'tension', 'going', 'not', 'claustrophobic', 'as', 'gory', 'original', 'Saw', '2', 'benefits', 'interesting', 'premise', 'rousing', 'finale', 'stages', 'pending', 'Saw', '3', 'may', 'find', 'bit', 'issue', 'pacing', 'not', 'contain', 'tension', 'scares', 'are', 'scarcer', 'are', 'first', 'release.Solid', 'performances', 'Saw', '2', 'cut', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'fans', 'original.Bonus', 'Materials', 'IncludeCommentary', 'director', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Beverley', 'MitchellJigsaw', 'Game', 'Making-of', 'FeaturetteBits', 'Pieces', 'Props', 'Saw', 'IIBits', 'Pieces', 'Traps', 'Saw', 'IIFeaturettesStoryboards4', '5Gareth', 'Von', 'Kallenbach']",Saw II
750497,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00008YOD2,General Zombie,"[0, 2]","I guess I'm just weird cause I really think this movie is a major step down from the original.  Sure, I'd anticipate that the foolish masses to think that this was equal to or better thant he original; they might think anything.  But there are plenty of people out there whose opinions I respect who think that this film was pretty much a lateral move, and I don't quite get that.  So again, maybe I'm just strange.  And I'm not as in love with the original as some people are, mind you; I like it a helluva lot, and actually appreciate a lot more after seeing the sequel, but it's certainly got some flaws.  People always accuse sequels of being pale imitations of the original, and nowhere is that more true than here.  It's watchable enough, for sure, but it lacks the sorta novelty of the original, and the clever, interesting plot.  I'm not gonna tell ya that the plot for the original was terribly plausible, but it was very compelling, I felt, and just had a sort of continuity to it that 'Saw II' lacks.  That and it just contained a kinda central mystery as to just what the hell is going on, but here we already know the basics, and the connection between the characters in the room here proves to be fairly mundane and obvious.  Here we're just basically waiting for them to get on with it.  In 'Saw II' they basically stuff 8 or so people in a room and have them bicker and kill themselves in the traps while Donnie Wahlberg yells and yells and yells across town.  To be perfectly blunt, this is just too much for me to take it entirely seriously no matter how well it might be done.  First of all, Wahlberg tends to be way, way over the top.  People complained about the acting in the original, but he's a bigger problem here then anyone was there.  Also, this time around Jigsaw has just got a rather enormous funhouse of death, and it's all a bit too elaborate and comes across a bit silly much of the time.  There's just so much there, so many wacky traps and whatnot.  Some of these individual scenarios are pretty damn neat, I'll admit, though they occasionally feel like parody and just generally aren't as interesting as the ones in the original. (And certainly none of them can match the jaw trap from the original film.)  The one chick, Amanda, being dumped in the pile of discarded hypodermic needles is definitely the best.  Ouch.Furthermore, the new director just doesn't the sort of handle on the material that Wan had.  Darren Lynn Bousman seems like he's trying to hard to just imitate the style of the original, and most of the flashy, music-video style stuff just comes off as silly and overwrought.  (This happened some in the original as well, actually, but it was more contained and effective in general.)  The style of the original was derivative, but you get the idea that they were making it that way because that's how they wanted it to be.  Ya get the feeling that Bousman made the film this way because that's how it was supposed to be, and it just doesn't generate the same atmosphere.The film hinges on a final plot twist which I must admit is fairly clever.  Again, it's not terribly likely, but whaddya expect in this kinda movie.  It was amusing enough.

Jigsaw soon became one of my favourite & most interesting villains of all time. I like the masks and characters used to define the startling fear of Jigsaw used in SAW. I expected something more than what I got from SAW2.Saw 2 is better than your average film and I would rate it four stars had I not seen Saw. I expected more from this film than a film full of commercial intent. Yes,friends, there is a lot of blood in this film but what the film lacks is that fear Saw got out of me(viewer). Saw2 is mostly loud yet unpenetrating. It's like a freakshow where a lot of characters are put into one sequence. It is sad to observe that the director couldnt overcome the FAILING SEQUEL SYNDROME the film industry is blessed with.Although I'm terrible at pinpointing flaws and guessing the suspense, Saw II is predictable enough for me to have guessed the twist in the end. A review on imdb.com said the twist in the end is even more ingenious than Saw. I strongly disagree.Saw2 is a mixed bag because of how confused the direction seems. The pace of the story is slow from the start especially since many unknown characters are pooled in. I suggest you give the film a watch for yourself to understand how aimless the direction gets an hour into the movie.Please See, If you think Final Destination2 is a better film than its prequel , you will like Saw2.In 18 months time, Saw III will be released and I will make sure I watch it. The policeman(father) in the film played a rather lousy role but I blame the direction rather than the actor for it.Want to watch a violent film that will shake your faith?

Saw II is one hell of a good movie with everything clicking right. The acting is solid notably the guy who played Jigsaw. If you watched the first one and liked it, then stop reading this right now and go watch it.This movie still has the same twists the first one did notably another great one at the end. The end sure is unpredictable and will continue this Saw franchise.Saw II opens with a guy being trapped and receiving orders from Jigsaw. Everything goes wrong for him and he gets his face smashed. Detective Matthews is on the case. He has an argument with his son and his son runs off. Guess what. They find Jigsaw..he's still the old guy and he has cancer and is breathing on a respirator. But wait..there's something else. Inside the room they find Jigsaw, there's 4 or 5 tvs and on them..it's not pretty. There are 8 people stranded in a room. One of them is Matthew's son. They have been given a toxic gas that will kill them if they don't get an antidote.What happens next is one hell of a good and really suspensful movie. Believe me, there are some serious gross out moments like in the first one.The movie's cleverness and geniune creepiness comes from Jigsaw though. All that he says makes perfect sense. He makes a serious point witch is very creepy. He's like John Doe in Seven, all that he says makes sense. He says that he is only putting people in this position because they don't cherish life which is the truth. The drug dealers, the suicidal people, all of them..But if you're placed in Jigsaw's position where they tell him he's going to die, then he starts to view life differently..starts to cherish it. Every glass of water, everything. And that is what makes the movie so fascinating because you see why Jigsaw became what he is and why he's doing it. This adds to the creepiness of the movie. The huge twist given in the movie is fascinating and the twisted irony at the end is brilliant. Just pay attention to everything Jigsaw says and in the end you'll see. All he wants is for detective Matthews to listen..so remember that.Saw II is one of the best movies of the year and I'm not talking about stupid horror like the texas chainsaw massacre. This movie is unforgettable and I will definitely watch it again. A complete must see...Saw II is a success, even comparable to the silence of the lambs and red dragon. Now that's something to say and besides the acting which is better in the silence of the lambs (by far), I think this movie is better. Now that's unbelievable.

750507,A2SRP2HP75CUVD,B00008YOD2,Horror-Fanatics.com,"[1, 1]","When it comes to films almost everybody can agree that sequels to hit movies usually never do as good. Its sort of like a curse, most sequels usually aren't as good as the originals but then again there are some major exceptions. Last year director James Wan brought us the horror masterpiece Saw, the independent feature which took both theaters and audiences by storm. Using a great story with some very interesting characters and a shocking twist to leave the fans with their jaws dropped to the ground. A year later Darren Lynn Bousman brings us an all new sequel featuring the famous Jigsaw once again to do what he does best. After many months of waiting I was so anxious and excited to finally see it.In this new installment we fallow Detective Eric Mason, a cop who is on the fast track of finding the Jigsaw killer. After a gruesome discovery Mason finds a clue and tracks Jigsaw to his personal lair. What Mason doesn't know is that there is a game being played during the investigation. A group of 8 strangers awaken and find themselves trapped in a house with no exit and no clue as to where they are. Filled with traps and deadly nerve gas, the group of strangers must find a way out of the house (or a cure) in 2 hours time before they die.I enjoyed the hell out of the first Saw, I thought it was a brilliant film not just for the cool story but also for the surprising suspense and turn near the end. So im happy to say that this new sequel is a must see for the fans of the first film. In this movie we are introduced to alot of new interesting characters and even get to see some old ones return. I liked the new story line alot. Much like the first film the story to this one fits much like a puzzle. The more the film passes the more of an understanding you have with both the characters and plot. I enjoyed everything from the story line to the wonderful new traps set up by the Jigsaw killer. For a sequel it does a wonderful job of giving the audience double of what we got from the first film. This movie has more characters, more traps, more blood and even more twists and turns. Im also really glad that they tied it with the first movie.What really killed it for some of the audience in the first film was the acting (and there is a real good reason for that). Well luckily with this film the acting is much better and more convincing. As I mentioned before this movie has more traps and the wonderful red stuff that we all seem to enjoy. The traps in this film are much more terrifying and can be pretty hard to stomach if you picture yourself in some of the characters situations. Theres everything from headgear, poison gas, needles and even a really cool easy bake oven. With all the cool new traps it definitely builds up some good suspense, even a few jumpy moments here and there. This movie has twice the thrills and overall violence which will leave the audience anticipated for whats going to happen next.As I also mentioned before this film is somewhat tied together with the first one. The setting and visuals are almost the same, its just as dark and imaginative. Only instead of seeing two guys trapped in a bathroom we get to see 8 people trapped in a house fighting and trying their best to survive and find an antidote. The direction it took is very memorable and much like the first movie theres a very neat twist at the end. I wont get into details but I will say that its a very interesting one. Its not as shocking and suspenseful like it was in the first film, but its a pretty good one none the less. Its not a perfect sequel and I did like the first film better by half an inch.

750512,A319SKSB556033,B00008YOD2,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[0, 0]","'Oh yes, there will be blood,' Jigsaw promises.Well about a tea-cup's worth if you're lucky. 'There will be boredom' or ""There will be headaches"" would be more appropriate tagline for this absolutely worthless, mess of a sequel. After the surprisingly great and successful original, Lionsgate immediately green-lit this movie for production and completion within less than a year. Exactly how good can a film be with such a short production schedule? The answer is not very good at all. In fact it's downright awful.Jigsaw has returned to teach ironic lessons to those who live dull lives yet are not truly alive. Only this time he attracts the attention of a half-crazed cop (oh wait, he did that last time as well) who is so thoroughly incompetent at his job that you'll want to jump into the movie and throttle him. Jigsaw has locked a bunch of strangers in a spooky old house with nerve gas slowly killing them. He gives them loads of clues on how to escape but since they are all idiots, none of them work together and their utter stupidity only serves to force the lumbering plot along and lead to their well deserved deaths.It's not just the bad script that kills the film, after all great filmmakers can make brilliance out of a rotten screenplay. It's the very poor editing, urine-soaked cinematography, incoherent pacing, and dumb characters that cripple the film beyond repair. First-time director Darren Lynn Bousman isn't exactly Uwe Boll, but his lack of experience behind the camera gives this entire film an amateurish, hack feel.Wahlberg's clich&eacute;d stereotype Detective is right out of a bad, 80s, bottom shelf Cop video and the people stuck in the poisonous house are just morons. The first Saw worked so well because we only had 2 victims who conversed and worked with/against each other for the whole film. We had a stronger attachment to them. And they looked for logical ways out before resorting to the painful. This time we get loads more victims with little explanation on who they are or what importance they have and they just never use their common sense.Another thing that bogs this sequel down even more is its total reliance on condescending to the audience. Any average movie goer could figure the best way out of most of the booby-traps and death scenarios but these stupid characters just do the dumbest things so they can get killed and so film offers up another corpse for us to scream at. But not even this works. Some guy climbs into a big oven (only a retard would do this in a horror film) and is burned alive. But we don't even see anything! And when he tries to pull himself out, not only is he not even burnt, but he just dies for no apparent reason. So his feet got burnt a bit, big deal! If their were no swearing in this film, it would be a PG-13 all the way. Don't expect any of the bone-chilling scares you got first time around.The only thing that stops Saw II from being a complete failure is the interesting, if incredibly stupid, plot twist. But is it worth suffering 90 minutes for? I would only recommend this film if you expect it to be crap, have lowered your expectations extremely far and obviously if you have the time and money to waste on it.Overall this is a disgrace to the original. Oh and said Saw only appears for about a second and half.The Blu-ray sports an okay 1.78:1 1080p image that has quite a few speckles to it. The sound is in loud, obnoxious DTS HD-MA, and decent amount of extras.",2,"A horrible, rushed cash-in",1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,3464,"[""'Oh"", 'yes', 'will', 'be', 'blood', 'Jigsaw', 'promises.Well', 'tea-cup', 'worth', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'will', 'be', 'boredom', 'will', 'be', 'headaches', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'tagline', 'absolutely', 'worthless', 'mess', 'sequel', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'successful', 'original', 'Lionsgate', 'immediately', 'green-lit', 'movie', 'production', 'completion', 'less', 'year', 'Exactly', 'how', 'good', 'can', 'film', 'be', 'such', 'short', 'production', 'schedule', 'answer', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'fact', 'downright', 'awful.Jigsaw', 'returned', 'teach', 'ironic', 'lessons', 'who', 'live', 'dull', 'lives', 'yet', 'are', 'not', 'truly', 'alive', 'Only', 'time', 'attention', 'half-crazed', 'cop', 'oh', 'wait', 'did', 'last', 'time', 'well', 'who', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'incompetent', 'job', ""'ll"", 'want', 'jump', 'movie', 'throttle', 'Jigsaw', 'locked', 'bunch', 'strangers', 'spooky', 'old', 'house', 'nerve', 'gas', 'slowly', 'killing', 'loads', 'clues', 'how', 'escape', 'are', 'idiots', 'none', 'work', 'together', 'utter', 'stupidity', 'only', 'force', 'lumbering', 'plot', 'lead', 'well', 'deserved', 'deaths.It', 'not', 'just', 'bad', 'script', 'film', 'great', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'make', 'brilliance', 'rotten', 'screenplay', 'very', 'poor', 'editing', 'urine-soaked', 'cinematography', 'incoherent', 'pacing', 'dumb', 'characters', 'cripple', 'film', 'repair', 'First-time', 'director', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'lack', 'experience', 'camera', 'entire', 'film', 'amateurish', 'hack', 'feel.Wahlberg', 'clich', 'eacute', 'stereotype', 'Detective', 'right', 'bad', '80s', 'bottom', 'shelf', 'Cop', 'video', 'people', 'stuck', 'poisonous', 'house', 'are', 'just', 'morons', 'first', 'Saw', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'only', 'had', '2', 'victims', 'who', 'conversed', 'worked', 'with/against', 'other', 'whole', 'film', 'had', 'stronger', 'attachment', 'looked', 'logical', 'ways', 'out', 'resorting', 'painful', 'time', 'get', 'loads', 'more', 'victims', 'little', 'explanation', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'importance', 'have', 'just', 'never', 'use', 'common', 'sense.Another', 'thing', 'sequel', 'down', 'even', 'more', 'total', 'reliance', 'condescending', 'audience', 'Any', 'average', 'movie', 'goer', 'could', 'figure', 'best', 'way', 'most', 'booby-traps', 'death', 'scenarios', 'stupid', 'characters', 'just', 'do', 'dumbest', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'killed', 'so', 'film', 'up', 'corpse', 'scream', 'not', 'even', 'guy', 'big', 'oven', 'only', 'retard', 'would', 'do', 'horror', 'film', 'burned', 'alive', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'anything', 'when', 'pull', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'even', 'burnt', 'just', 'apparent', 'reason', 'feet', 'got', 'burnt', 'bit', 'big', 'deal', 'were', 'swearing', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'PG-13', 'way', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'bone-chilling', 'scares', 'got', 'first', 'time', 'only', 'thing', 'Saw', 'II', 'being', 'complete', 'failure', 'interesting', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'plot', 'twist', 'worth', 'suffering', '90', 'minutes', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'film', 'expect', 'be', 'crap', 'have', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'extremely', 'far', 'obviously', 'have', 'time', 'money', 'waste', 'it.Overall', 'disgrace', 'original', 'Oh', 'said', 'Saw', 'only', 'second', 'half.The', 'Blu-ray', 'sports', 'okay', '1.78:1', '1080p', 'image', 'quite', 'few', 'speckles', 'sound', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'DTS', 'HD-MA', 'decent', 'amount', 'extras']",Saw II

In my opinion, SAW II is the best in the film series.At the opening of the Twisted Pictures production, we see Michael (Noam Jenkins) wearing an opened iron face mask contraption and he must obey the order of the Jigsaw Killer.  He has only a small amount of time to find the key that will set him free and alive. If he doesn't ""retrieve"" the key, the iron mask will close on his face and kill him.Cop, Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) must bail out his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) from jail. He is tired of dealing with his son's behavior and is so stressed out, he wants him to live somewhere else. Matthews must answer to a call of a homicide. The Jigsaw Killer has struck again. He comes face to face with the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell) and Matthews and his team find themselves under timed pressure.Eight people (Shawnee Smith, Franky G., Erik Knudsen, Emmanuell Vaugier, Beverley Mitchell, Glenn Plummer, Timothy Burd, Tony Nappo) are locked in a room somewhere in town. They must find them because Matthew's son is also trapped in that room and time is running out.That is just the start of this film. Memorable, shocking scenes you will never forget.Donnie Wahlberg and Franky G. really are interesting in this film.  They both give strong performances.I wonder if this role by Donnie Wahlberg helped him get noticed for the role of ""Danny Reagan"" in theBlue Bloods: The First Seasontv series.Producer, Gregg Hoffman died December 4, 2005. Age: 42. He was admitted to the hospital complaining of neck pain. He died of natural causes.Full Screen Rated ""R"" DVD edition includes informative audio commentary with Director Darren Lynn Bausman and actor Donnie Wahlberg. It can be found in ""Set-Up"".Featurettes will show you how all traps were created including the oven and hypodermic needles trap.The DVD container is wrapped in tight plastic, but be careful, there is also a protective see-through cover slip that lifts off that you need to save.

Enjoy.A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.Saw TWO begins with EIGHT people trapped in an abandoned NERVE GAS HOUSE.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) game, XAVIER CHAVEZ (Frankie G.), GUS COLYARD (Tony Nappo), and OBI TATE (Tim Burd), among others, have to prove their will to live, and their ability to COOPERATE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), OFFICER DANIEL RIGG (Lyriq Bent), and rugged veteran DET. ERIC MATTHEWS (Donnie Wahlberg) are investigating as a team, but ERIC MATTHEWS may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participants learn that OBI may be an accomplice to their abduction, and their situation provides a choice between VARIOUS TRAPS or guaranteed death.  To help their cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead the captives (aka life's perpetrators) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.Several murderous contraptions like the MAGNUM EYE HOLE (for a MONEY LAUNDERER), the FURNACE TRAP (for a CONMAN), and the NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK (for a DRUG DEALER who tosses in a JUNKIE) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the opening scene VENUS FLY TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S ACCOMPLICES, and on to Saw III.Jason Elin",4,Saw II - Where did he get all those needles?,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,1961,"['consecutively', 'watching', 'entire', 'Saw', 'series', 'recent', 'weekend', 'LOVING', 'decided', 'single', 'review', 'modified', 'details', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'films', 'Enjoy.A', 'sadistic', 'sociopath', 'similar', 'one', 'Se7en', 'affinity', 'engineering', 'play', 'lethal', 'games', 'forcing', 'victims', 'unappreciative', 'life', 'existential', 'choice', 'million', 'dollars', 'worth', 'engineering', 'machinery.Saw', 'TWO', 'EIGHT', 'people', 'trapped', 'abandoned', 'NERVE', 'GAS', 'HOUSE', 'Forced', 'play', 'killer', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'John', 'Jigsaw', 'Kramer', 'game', 'XAVIER', 'CHAVEZ', 'Frankie', 'G.', 'GUS', 'COLYARD', 'Tony', 'Nappo', 'OBI', 'TATE', 'Tim', 'Burd', 'others', 'have', 'prove', 'will', 'live', 'ability', 'COOPERATE', 'Meanwhile', 'DET', 'ALLISON', 'KERRY', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'OFFICER', 'DANIEL', 'RIGG', 'Lyriq', 'Bent', 'rugged', 'veteran', 'DET', 'ERIC', 'MATTHEWS', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'are', 'investigating', 'team', 'ERIC', 'MATTHEWS', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'deep', 'law', 'increasingly', 'closer', 'ensnaring', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'participants', 'learn', 'OBI', 'may', 'be', 'accomplice', 'abduction', 'situation', 'choice', 'VARIOUS', 'TRAPS', 'guaranteed', 'death', 'help', 'cause', 'cryptic', 'clues', 'left', 'mini', 'cassette', 'tape', 'lead', 'captives', 'aka', 'life', 'perpetrators', 'towards', 'precipice', 'twisted', 'rehabilitation', 'potential', 'tomb.Several', 'murderous', 'contraptions', 'MAGNUM', 'EYE', 'HOLE', 'MONEY', 'LAUNDERER', 'FURNACE', 'TRAP', 'CONMAN', 'NEEDLE', 'IN', 'A', 'HAYSTACK', 'DRUG', 'DEALER', 'who', 'JUNKIE', 'provide', 'horror', 'fodder', 'form', 'viscera', 'blood', 'spatter', 'other', 'traps', 'opening', 'scene', 'VENUS', 'FLY', 'TRAP', 'are', 'inserted', 'same', 'reason', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'always', 'took', 'ensign', 'Jones', 'away', 'parties', 'someone', 'situation', 'die', 'horribly', 'Climax', 'cliffhanger', 'are', 'quick', 'succession', 'flashbacks', 'provide', 'necessary', 'details', 'viewer', 'more', 'JIGSAW', 'ACCOMPLICES', 'Saw', 'III.Jason', 'Elin']",Saw II

Munson,"[1, 1]","The evil ""jigsaw"" is back for another round of mayhem and torture in this fine sequel to the first ""Saw""  Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is investigating a recent homicide when he discovers that the victim has a jigsaw shaped piece of skin removed.  That left no question in his mind who was behind the killings: Jigsaw himself.  At first, Matthews is reluctant to get involved in the jigsaw case, but with a little prodding from his partner Kerry (Dina Meyer) and a sudden realization on his part, Eric finds out where Jigsaw is hiding out and moves in for the capture.However, unknown to Eric and Kerry, capture was part of Jigsaw's plan.  He has captured eight more unsuspecting hostages and locked them in a house which is slowly being contaminated by poison gas.  To make matters worse, one of the intended victims is Eric's own son Daniel (Erik Knudsen).  All of the hostages have one thing in common; they were all set up by Detective Matthews in order for him to gain a conviction.Jigsaw has supposedly hid vials of antedote throughout the house which will counter-act the effects of the poison, but there are other clues as well.  Each person has a number drawn on the back of their necks.  These numbers form a combination to a safe which contains the antedote.  It soon becomes apparent that the only way the hostages will survive is to work together, but that idea soon goes out the window, and everyone is looking out for themselves and not worrying about anyone else.Meanwhile, Jigsaw and Detective Matthews have begun an interesting interaction of their own.  Jigsaw practically tells Matthews the location of his son at the beginning of their conversation, but Matthews, in his rage, misses the clues.  Soon, Matthews loses all of his patience and unleashes his own attack on Jigsaw.  Will Detective Matthews find his son before its too late?I thought the first movie was good, but this one is even better.  The plot of this movie is excellent, and the high point of the film is its surprise ending.  It will leave you spellbound.  I highly recommend this movie.  The acting is very good, and the twists and turns will keep you glued to the screen.  This movie is a must for horror movie fans and people who saw the first film.

The acting in the first wasn't that good at all and I think this one is superior in that way. Plus the plot is better, you just don't have 2 guys giving bad performances while being  stuck in a room together. You have a few people giving bad performances stuck in a gory maze of pain and punishment instead lol. Although they're certainly better than how bad Cary Elwes was in the original.This one is about how Jigsaw has it out for a detective played by Donnie Wahlberg. So he takes his son and puts him in a house full of traps with some other poor souls. Wahlberg and other cops have Jigsaw caught but he still holds all the cards. Tobin Bell (24 season 2, Saw) is brilliant as Jigsaw and he doesn't get any credit for that. Shawnee Smith returns as Amanda who escaped Jigsaw's crazy games once before and is now stuck in a trap once again. Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers) is in the cast from the first but I don't remember her. Anyway she's a cop who gets Wahlberg to join her in pursuit of Jigsaw. She also gives one of the better performances next to Bell. Who knows maybe she'll even be back for the already in production 3rd gorefest Saw 3.

It starts off with a guy stuck in a face trap to mirror the jaw trap from the first one. There is a face plate with rusted nails inside that will snap on his face if he doesnt find the key in time.  But the key is inside his eye. Not being able to take out his eye for the key, it snaps shut on him, killing him.  When the investigators find him, they also discover a message that says ""look closer"" to the detective. They soon find jigsaw killer, but he is not able to do much of anything anymore, due to the cancer he has that we found out aobut in the first movie.  But the detective soon discovers monitors which show 8 or 9 people trapped in a house full of traps, his son being one of them.  All the people in the house are connected somehow, and you find out something about the detective as well.  Amanda is also trapped in the house.

I was captured by it. To me nobody elses opinion really mattered much. It was violent gritty yet under neath it all there was a message that few movies had touched upon. On October 28th 2005. I found myself on the same road going down the same street in the same town to the same movie theatre. My purpose? To see the sequal ""Saw 2"" at first, I wasn't sure what to think, with Donnie Walburg ( ex boy band member) however, as soon as it began. I realized I was in for the same suprise I had when I viewed the first. From the first scene on which involves an updated version of the ""venus fly trap"" head gear and another victim. Our hero played by Donnie is a cop who is losing touch with his son and his own world. After a message from Jigsaw on the ceiling of a victim's death. It becomes apparent, he has a bone to pick with the detective. Soon they return to the place where Jigsaw has watched his victims die/survive for who knows how long. With that, the game begins. Donnie's acting trys a little too hard to be like Bruce willis' style of tough badass cop. He does a GREAT job though. The story is incredible. However, is it better than the first? About equal actually. There is one scene where you see a certain ""something"" or somebody actually, I just don't wanna give the plot away so we'll leave it at that, that may put the second one in the back seat to the first.

While the film has many of the qualities that made the original so good it does have a few drawbacks.  This time the main story is really the investigation into the Jigsaw crimes.  The secondary story involves eight people locked in a house filled with a deadly nerve agent.  They have two hours to find the antidotes so that they can survive the three hours until the doors unlock.  One of the eight is the detective's son.  After an opening death involving a death mask, the detective tracks down Jigsaw.  He also find monitors showing what is going on with the eight people in the locked house.The detective tries to get information out of Jigsaw while technicians try to discover where the video signal is coming from.  There is a lot of time spent with Jigsaw and we learn quite a bit about his character.  In the house, people begin to fall to elaborate traps as they look for the antidotes.  The two plot lines eventually merge and we get some more of the wonderful twists that helped make the first movie so chilling.The people in the house just didn't work too well for me.  There was not the same sense of desperation and helplessness as provided by simple chains in the firs movie.  Here the people are free to roam the house and there are weapons available.  The invisible nerve agent seen only in the form of some coughing (twice with blood) also did not provide tension in the way a clock on the wall did in Saw.  The deaths that occur in the house seem lees like Jigsaw's earlier games.  It is not apparent how the victims can win the games and appears more like a minefield than something that can be though or toughed out.  Still, it was a good film with good twists and serious psychological aspects.  By itself it is a good horror film but compared to the first it is somewhat lacking.

750538,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00008YOD2,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","After amassing an excellent box office return with the smash horror hit ""Saw"" in 2004, Lionsgate Films released the inevitable sequel ""Saw 2"" just one year later in hopes of maximizing their returns by riding the coattails of the first film's success. With a mostly new cast consisting of fairly talented, yet not so well known actors, such as, Donnie Wahlberg (""Ransom""), Emmanuelle Vaugier (TV's ""Smallville""), and Beverly Mitchell (TV's ""7th Heaven"") acting alongside returning members from the first film, Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith, I for one was unsure whether this would be a horror sequel worthy of being watched or yet another inferior sequel in a line that is far too long to begin with.""Saw 2"" picks up shortly after the events of the first film, as Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the madman from the first movie has returned with a new set of games to play and traps to set. When Jigsaw's newest victim is purposely left in the open to be discovered by the police, lead detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) traces the crime back to its perpetrator with relative ease. With Jigsaw being caught, what would seem to most people to be a massive set back to his plans, is merely just another aspect of the game that he has carefully set into motion. As the detectives desperately try to break Jigsaw, eight new victims are trapped and fighting for their very lives. With time running out the choice faced by all involved can easily be summed up by Jigsaw's cryptic motto, ""Live or die, make your choice.""Here's the thing with ""Saw 2"", it's kind of a mixed bag in terms of my take on the movie. On one hand I thought it was a very solid, and in some ways surprising follow up film to one of the most original horror films I had ever seen. On the other hand, certain aspects to the film felt somewhat standard and by the book, and featured characters that were not nearly as interesting as those in the first film.I thought that as far as the story for this installment goes it was just as interesting, and even a little more in depth than the first one. This chapter in the 'Saw' saga gave viewers more of an insight into what pushes Jigsaw to do what he does and how he rationalizes it all. This element of the story was surprising because I expected it to make me feel somewhat sorry for him, which I would not have liked at all, but instead it makes you realize just how extremely disturbed he truly is, because his reasons are purely insane. This approach was a surprise for me, and one that I appreciated from the writers (Leigh Whannell and Darren Lynn Bousman) because they opted not to attempt to gain sympathy from the audience towards Jigsaw, but instead chose to show him as a normal human being at one point in his life, who snaps and begins this insane quest to teach others to appreciate life. What a novel concept for a writer to try, for once lets try to keep the villain despicable throughout the series, rather than make him a likable guy who is just misunderstood or has been led astray.The cast, as I stated earlier, is not as well known as the first film's, but is still decent all the same. Donnie Wahlberg is a better lead than Cary Elwes, and his character was far more interesting due to his somewhat corrupt nature, and his link to the eight victims trapped by Jigsaw made for interesting drama as the plot unfolded. The various members of the cast that comprised the eight trapped characters were adequate; some of them gave solid, believable performances, while others just gave audiences typical horror movie throwaway characters that the audience could care less about. Tobin Bell was featured much more heavily in this film than he had in the previous, and he is allowed to give more depth to Jigsaw this time around, and he does a wonderful job of portraying the two time periods of the character's life that are depicted in the film. In the flashbacks we see him when he was known simply as John, a normal man who is given horrible news, the fact that he has cancer. This news shakes him to his very core, and serves as the catalyst to his downward spiral into insanity. Then we see him throughout the rest of the movie as the evil, manipulative Jigsaw; the way Tobin plays the two sides of the same person so drastically different is a great showcase of his acting talent.The biggest problem I had with ""Saw 2"" was the fact that some of the characters featured in this movie were just flat-out unlikable, and yet these were the ones we should have been rooting for to survive to the end of the film. However, for many of them I didn't really care if they succumbed to Jigsaw's maniacal plans. Now, I'm well aware that some of the eight soon-to-be victims were designed to be as unlikable as possible, but to me for a horror movie to truly work, each and every character that is being pursued by the killer should have at least some redeeming qualities so the audience can feel some sense of loss when they are killed by the killer, this isn't the case with ""Saw 2"". At least half of the eight people trapped are some form of despicable criminal, who I felt deserved punishment, maybe not the kind as severe as Jigsaw had set, but I still didn't feel too bad when their time came. What made the first film work somewhat better than this one was that the characters, though flawed, were still likable and people the audience could root for to survive through to the end. If ""Saw 2"" would have taken this approach a little more then the movie would have been just as good as the first.The traps, which are the focus of this series of films, are just as innovative and original as the first one. But, some of the setups for the traps relied heavily on the characters being stupid enough to fall for them, which of course they did. Where the first one had the traps being forced upon the victims, this one seemed like each trap being sprung was purely coincidence, that there wasn't as much planning on Jigsaw's part to force the character's to fall prey to his deadly machinations. ""Saw 2"" also used the traps to focus more on bloodshed and gore than the first film did, where the director of the original movie, James Wan (who opted not to return for some reason), didn't rely on as much gore to scare the audience, the new director Darren Lynn Bousman (who also co-wrote the film) went for less of an eerie atmosphere and more for blood and gore, which is the more typical horror movie route, and also served to bring this installment down some by not being as original.""Saw 2"" is an effective sequel to one of the most original horror movies of all time. However, a little too much reliance on convenience in places, along with too many unlikable characters denied this movie from meeting the standards set forth by the first film. Even though I have more gripes with this installment than I did the first one, it is still a superior horror movie compared to most horror sequels or just horror films in general that are released these days.""Saw 2"" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both contain violence and language.",3,"Jigsaw Is Back, and There Will Be Blood...",1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,7065,"['amassing',

Too many holes and fabrications!Also they were locked up in some sort of a room setup and there were not many palces and things for them to figure out, there would be a door and a timer and a stupid task.

Unfortunately for me, I like to buy these films on the day that they are released so I can add them to my collection, so a few months down the line I get to dish out another $20 or so for the UNRATED version.  With part one I actually got an additional 20 seconds of gore for my extra purchase, wow! This one, I have compared with my ""R"" rated version and there is no difference in the gore whatsoever.  Some scenes are extended and that is about it.  This is why the running times are different.  Then you get a second disk, which has a few extras concerning the film, and the rest was obviously just thrown together to help sell this version.  It is a great movie, better than part one I think, but if you already own the ""R"" rated version don't rush out and buy this one.

It's a failure in the sense that though it has a number of horrific shocking moments like SawI, they are far less effective than the ones in SawI. And it's a success because it's significantly more complicated and thus, in a sense, more intelligent than SawI. However, overall it's not as impressive and as memorable as its predecessor.

What seems to scare people more than fake scary movies or make believe characters are people that are real and stories that feel even realer. In Saw it feels more possible for this to be done and this creates more fear and more thinking than you would get from a traditional scary movie. If you ask me Saw 2 is just as good as the first with the same intelligent but sadistic games. It's so good that you even start to get the message that trying to be passed by Jigsaw.

Saw 2 not only has similarites, but looks almost exactly like it. People locked in a house full of traps, entering the first room to get to the second. Sure this film is a lot better than Cube, but it could have done a lot better than this. Throughout the film when something big is about to happen, it just comes across different death scenes like slasher films. Saw is NOT a slasher film. Saw 2, however, follows in its footsteps, finding an easy way out. Its like they just want to get this film over with. Saw 2 still has a neat ending but also added something a little silly to it.

Serial Killer (Jigsaw) returns to torment more of the poor saps he views as wasting their lives. Sticks them all in a room to escape from (and in this case, a house), filled with all sorts of nasty little ambushes along the way, and taunts the cop(s) who track him down, until they play along with his twisted little game.Frankly, the first Saw suprised me. Nice premise, an abundance of ingeniously grisly scenarios, effective twist at the end. On reflection, it's almost too preposterous to get around. The acting was God-awful bad, especially by Cary Elwes. And you can't tell me that the two imbeciles chained a few feet apart in that itty-bitty room wouldn't eventually have figured out that the guy lying on the floor between them in a pool of blood wasn't really dead, got a little bit ticked off, and taken their saws to him. I mean, come on. How long can somebody lie on a cold tile floor and stay perfectly still? You'd think at some point his bladder would've given out, or something. I guess though, being Jigsaw he would have been prepared for that eventuality.Still, all and all a decent low-budget indie horror film.A decent, low budget indie horror film that made a butt-load of money. And what do the studio guys in Hollywood do when the smell of a franchise wafts their way? That's right. Sequels. So here we are...This time around, director Darren Lynn Bousman had more cash to play with, although it doesn't really show. The production values all look about the same, and we don't really get any more 'big name' actors either.However, the acting in this go-around is in better shape, at least by the main players. Donnie Wahlberg works hard to bring his underwritten character - the disenfranchised, angry cop - to life. Honestly, everybody is underwritten; just there as set pieces to be whacked off, one-by-one, in various grisly ways.Overall, the film isn't bad, but it suffers from conforming to another of Hollywoods universal rules: audiences want the same thing, only different.Sequel-itis.So watch out for Saw III.",3,"Ah, the first of the inevitable sequels",1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,2127,"['Okay', 'so', ""'re"", 'reading', 'probably', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'set', 'up', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'Jigsaw', 'torment', 'more', 'poor', 'saps', 'wasting', 'lives', 'Sticks', 'room', 'escape', 'case', 'house', 'filled', 'sorts', 'nasty', 'little', 'ambushes', 'way', 'cop', 'who', 'track', 'down', 'play', 'along', 'twisted', 'little', 'game.Frankly', 'first', 'Saw', 'suprised', 'Nice', 'premise', 'abundance', 'ingeniously', 'grisly', 'scenarios', 'effective', 'twist', 'end', 'reflection', 'almost', 'too', 'preposterous', 'get', 'around', 'acting', 'was', 'God-awful', 'bad', 'especially', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'two', 'imbeciles', 'chained', 'few', 'feet', 'apart', 'itty-bitty', 'room', 'would', ""n't"", 'eventually', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'guy', 'lying', 'floor', 'pool', 'blood', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'dead', 'got', 'little', 'bit', 'ticked', 'off', 'taken', 'saws', 'mean', 'come', 'How', 'long', 'can', 'somebody', 'lie', 'cold', 'tile', 'floor', 'stay', 'perfectly', 'still', ""'d"", 'think', 'point', 'bladder', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'out', 'something', 'guess', 'though', 'being', 'Jigsaw', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'prepared', 'eventuality.Still', 'decent', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'horror', 'film.A', 'decent', 'low', 'budget', 'indie', 'horror', 'film', 'made', 'butt-load', 'money', 'do', 'studio', 'guys', 'Hollywood', 'do', 'when', 'smell', 'franchise', 'wafts', 'way', 'right', 'Sequels', 'So', 'here', 'are', 'time', 'around', 'director', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'had', 'more', 'cash', 'play', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'production', 'look', 'same', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'more', ""'big"", 'name', 'actors', 'either.However', 'acting', 'go-around', 'better', 'shape', 'least', 'main', 'players', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'hard', 'bring', 'underwritten', 'character', 'disenfranchised', 'angry', 'cop', 'life', 'Honestly', 'everybody', 'underwritten', 'just', 'as', 'set', 'pieces', 'be', 'whacked', 'off', 'one-by-one', 'various', 'grisly', 'ways.Overall', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'conforming', 'Hollywoods', 'universal', 'rules', 'audiences', 'want', 'same', 'thing', 'only', 'different.Sequel-itis.So', 'watch', 'Saw', 'III']",Saw II

A notion that Saw (2004) once capitalized on through the evil contraptions that the psychopathic mastermind Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) created to muse himself over innocent people's desire to live.  Jigsaw forced his victims to a rude awakening where his victims learned how and when they would die, unless they acted without hesitation.  Many of the psychopath's devices focused on gruesome self-mutilation that had a clear connection with the victim's character and past.  For Jigsaw, it is a game where he forces his victims to take the test of survival, and if they fail - they die!The sequel opens in a similar fashion under the cutting light of a naked light bulb where a man awakens undressed with a brutally looking device strapped to his neck and shoulders.  It is clear that the victim is not completely without sin, as he is a police informant.  In order to survive the contraption's bear trap consequence he must obtain a key behind his own eye.  There is an obvious presence of sadistic cruelty, as the man feebly attempts to find a solution to the problem before him.  The resolve of the situation assures the audience that more gruesomeness and terrorizing horror will emerge within the next hour and a half, as the viewer is to experience a fear-inducing sequel with more of Jigsaw's ruthless games.Unlike the films predecessor, Saw II does not attempt to hide Jigsaw's identity.  Instead, he seems to intentionally seek the law enforcement to apprehend him.  In particular Detective Matthews' (Donnie Walhberg) whom Jigsaw singles out through the message ""Look closer Detective Matthews.""  Quickly, Det. Matthews understands the clues, which leads them to an abandon factory where Jigsaw awaits.  Together with Det. Kerry (Dina Meyer) who leads the investigation, Matthews enters the factory with a S.W.A.T. team and after some blood-spattered predicament finds Jigsaw calmly inhaling oxygen through his oxygen mask.At first, one must sense that it is a trap, and it is, as Jigsaw has kidnapped Matthews's son along with eight other shady characters.  These nine individuals are locked up in a house of unknown location where they have been breathing a highly toxic nerve agent that will begin to dissolve their bodies into bleeding mess of flesh.  In a time when the American people fear terrorist attacks and weapons of mass destruction the concept will undoubtedly enhance the suspense.  However, if additional thought is placed on the concept of the nerve gas, it also provides a huge plot hole. It is not like people can buy nerve gas at the street corner, and it makes it a little amusing that Jigsaw is able to find it.  In addition, nerve gas does not, as far as I know, produce symptoms similar to hemorrhagic fever.  But, if the audience is willing to see beyond this slightly distorted reality, then Saw II will bring a terrorizing experience.  All Matthews can do is watch his son and the others slowly being decimated by Jigsaw's little games within the game.Meanwhile, Jigsaw insists to talk with Matthews, as he enlightens Matthews that he must play by his rules if he wants his son alive.  It is with a great deal of irony that Jigsaw has planned this meeting with Matthews, as the detective often plays by his own rules when he arrests suspects.  Besides planning his own capture, Jigsaw has one final triumph up his sleeve, which he plays with brutal refinement when time runs short.The film possesses disturbing imagery of torture, murder, and other unsettling themes that are presented through Jigsaw's meticulous planning.  The cinematography helps to enhance the dark and agonizing atmosphere through the green camera filter.  In addition, the lighting of the scenes provides additional atmospheric elements that heighten the terror.  Special effects also provide a large bulk of the gruesomeness within the story.  Together with the fundamental concept stemming from the fear of death these visual aspects succeeds in bring forth a traumatic experience.  One of the negative aspects of the film rests within the characters that are portrayed in a too stereotypical perspective and they lack a complex psychology.  The film could also exploit the possibilities of a more profound meaning of why people fear death, which might have augmented the element of horror within the film.  Yet, the overall cinematic experience brings the audience into a disturbing world where horror and terror work very well and leave the audience truly frightened.",3,Dark and Disturbingly Terrorizing Horror Film...,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,4578,"['Fear', 'death', 'overrun', 'society', 'fear', 'primal', 'motivating', 'factor', 'keep', 'people', 'alive', 'notion', 'Saw', '2004', 'once', 'capitalized', 'evil', 'contraptions', 'psychopathic', 'mastermind', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'created', 'muse', 'innocent', 'people', 'desire', 'live', 'Jigsaw', 'forced', 'victims', 'rude', 'awakening', 'where', 'victims', 'learned', 'how', 'when', 'would', 'die', 'acted', 'hesitation', 'Many', 'psychopath', 'devices', 'focused', 'gruesome', 'self-mutilation', 'had', 'clear', 'connection', 'victim', 'character', 'past', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'where', 'victims', 'take', 'test', 'survival', 'fail', 'die', 'sequel', 'similar', 'fashion', 'cutting', 'light', 'naked', 'light', 'bulb', 'where', 'man', 'undressed', 'brutally', 'looking', 'device', 'strapped', 'neck', 'shoulders', 'clear', 'victim', 'not', 'completely', 'sin', 'police', 'informant', 'order', 'survive', 'contraption', 'bear', 'trap', 'consequence', 'must', 'obtain', 'key', 'own', 'eye', 'obvious', 'presence', 'sadistic', 'cruelty', 'man', 'feebly', 'find', 'solution', 'problem', 'resolve', 'situation', 'audience', 'more', 'gruesomeness', 'terrorizing', 'horror', 'will', 'emerge', 'next', 'hour', 'half', 'viewer', 'experience', 'fear-inducing', 'sequel', 'more', 'Jigsaw', 'ruthless', 'films', 'predecessor', 'Saw', 'II', 'not', 'attempt', 'hide', 'Jigsaw', 'identity', 'Instead', 'intentionally', 'seek', 'law', 'enforcement', 'apprehend', 'particular', 'Detective', 'Matthews', 'Donnie', 'Walhberg', 'whom', 'Jigsaw', 'out', 'message', 'Look', 'closer', 'Detective', 'Matthews', 'Quickly', 'Det', 'Matthews', 'clues', 'abandon', 'factory', 'where', 'Jigsaw', 'Together', 'Det', 'Kerry', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'who', 'investigation', 'Matthews', 'factory', 'S.W.A.T', 'team', 'blood-spattered', 'predicament', 'Jigsaw', 'calmly', 'inhaling', 'oxygen', 'oxygen', 'mask.At', 'first', 'must', 'sense', 'trap', 'Jigsaw', 'kidnapped', 'Matthews', 'son', 'eight', 'other', 'shady', 'characters', 'nine', 'individuals', 'are', 'locked', 'up', 'house', 'unknown', 'location', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'breathing', 'highly', 'toxic', 'nerve', 'agent', 'will', 'begin', 'dissolve', 'bodies', 'bleeding', 'mess', 'flesh', 'time', 'when', 'American', 'people', 'fear', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'concept', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'enhance', 'suspense', 'However', 'additional', 'thought', 'placed', 'concept', 'nerve', 'gas', 'also', 'huge', 'plot', 'hole', 'not', 'like', 'people', 'can', 'buy', 'nerve', 'gas', 'street', 'corner', 'little', 'amusing', 'Jigsaw', 'able', 'find', 'addition', 'nerve', 'gas', 'not', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'produce', 'symptoms', 'similar', 'hemorrhagic', 'fever', 'audience', 'willing', 'see', 'slightly', 'distorted', 'reality', 'then', 'Saw', 'II', 'will', 'bring', 'terrorizing', 'experience', 'Matthews', 'can', 'do', 'watch', 'son', 'others', 'slowly', 'being', 'decimated', 'Jigsaw', 'little', 'games', 'game.Meanwhile', 'Jigsaw', 'talk', 'Matthews', 'Matthews', 'must', 'play', 'rules', 'son', 'alive', 'great', 'deal', 'irony', 'Jigsaw', 'planned', 'meeting', 'Matthews', 'detective', 'often', 'own', 'rules', 'when', 'suspects', 'planning', 'own', 'capture', 'Jigsaw', 'one', 'final', 'triumph', 'up', 'sleeve', 'brutal', 'refinement', 'when', 'time', 'short.The', 'film', 'possesses', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'torture', 'murder', 'other', 'unsettling', 'themes', 'are', 'presented', 'Jigsaw', 'meticulous', 'planning', 'cinematography', 'enhance', 'dark', 'agonizing', 'atmosphere', 'green', 'camera', 'filter', 'addition', 'lighting', 'scenes', 'additional', 'atmospheric', 'elements', 'heighten', 'terror', 'Special', 'effects', 'also', 'provide', 'large', 'bulk', 'gruesomeness', 'story', 'Together', 'fundamental', 'concept', 'stemming', 'fear', 'death', 'visual', 'aspects', 'bring', 'forth', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'One', 'negative', 'aspects', 'film', 'rests', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'too', 'stereotypical', 'perspective', 'lack', 'complex', 'psychology', 'film', 'could', 'also', 'exploit', 'possibilities', 'more', 'profound', 'meaning', 'why', 'people', 'fear', 'death', 'might', 'have', 'augmented', 'element', 'horror', 'film', 'overall', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'audience', 'disturbing', 'world', 'where', 'horror', 'terror', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'leave', 'audience', 'truly', 'frightened']",Saw II

750553,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008YOD2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 7]","I was not originally planning to see ""Saw II"" in the theater.  ""Saw"" was the last horror film I made a point of going to see instead of just waiting for the DVD, but that was on the strength of strong reviews and since ""Saw II"" just opened today the critical and public verdicts have yet to be determined.  But then I saw the trailer and discovered that Beverly Mitchell was in the cast and that tipped the scale towards going to the first showing on the first day, because the possibility of seeing Lucy Camden Kinkirk die a horrible death in a splatter flick appeals to me (the character drives me up the wall).  I know lots of people went to go see ""House of Wax"" just to watch Paris Hilton die on screen, so it is not like I am the only sick person on the planet.It goes without saying that your enjoyment of ""Saw II"" is predicated entirely on your having seen the original.  There is not a recap per se, but we begin with a reminder of exactly the sort of games that Jigsaw plays.  Then we are introduced to Detective Eric Mason (Donnie Wahlberg), who is brought in on the case because Jigsaw has left him a message.  Mason is one of those world-weary cops who has enough personal and professional problems without having a psycho killer playing mind games with him, so he does not want to play.  But of course Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) forces the issue as once again there are games within games within games.So, while Jigsaw is playing his little game with the police, on the monitors we see the interiors of a house when Jigsaw has trapped a group of people like rats.  I do not need to get ahead of the movie in terms of introducing the characters beyond pointing out that we already know two of them.  One is Daniel (Erik Knudsen), who is Marsh's son, and the other is Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who has the distinction of being the only person ever to have survived one of Jigsaw's little games.  The game this time has two parts.  The first is that they are all breathing a toxic gas.  A door to the outside will open in three hours, but unless they get to an antidote they will all be dead within two (""There will be blood,"" Jigsaw promises).  The second part of the game is that each person in the house will get to play their own little personal game in an effort to get their hands on the antidote.If you are expecting everybody to take turns playing their own personal game, then you are going to be disappointed, because that possibility disappears before they even get out of the first room.  With more than two characters playing the game we certainly do not get to know any of them as well as we did last time.  Still, ""Saw II"" plays off of the original, which is exactly what you want it to do, and one of the strengths of this film is how it finds a new way to do old things in a new way, which is also what you want it to do.  Unlike most contemporary horror films (e.g., ""Jeepers Creepers""), this one has a better payoff than a set up.  At least that is what I was thinking when I was sitting in the dark watching the end credits.  So while I do not think many people will find ""Saw II"" superior to the original, I also think most people will not be as disappointed watching ""Saw II"" as they usually are when they watch a sequel to a horror film they liked.Director Darren Lynn Bousman (""Butterfly Dreams,"" ""Identity Lost"") co-wrote the script with Leigh Whannell, who came up with the original story for ""Saw"" and wrote the screenplay with director James Wan, and I have a complaint in that the director undercuts the writers and actors at key moments.  Take the opening sequence, where within a minute of the movie starting they have come up with a situation where you want to close your eyes rather than see what is happening on screen.  But just when you are about to close your eyes and keep them shut, editor Kevin Greutert goes into overdrive and we are at the other end of the spectrum where things are flashing by so quickly you cannot tell what you are seeing.  That strikes me as rather counterproductive for this type of a movie and is the reason I ended up rounding down on this one (and not because of what does or does not happen to Mitchell's character).  Despite that, ""Saw II"" should deliver the goods this Hallowee weekend, which is just what horror fans need to hear.",4,"It is game over when you go to see ""Saw II""",1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,4303,"['was', 'not', 'originally', 'planning', 'see', 'Saw', 'II', 'theater', 'Saw', 'was', 'last', 'horror', 'film', 'made', 'point', 'going', 'see', 'instead', 'just', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'was', 'strength', 'strong', 'reviews', 'Saw', 'II', 'just', 'opened', 'today', 'critical', 'public', 'verdicts', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'determined', 'then', 'saw', 'trailer', 'discovered', 'Beverly', 'Mitchell', 'was', 'cast', 'tipped', 'scale', 'towards', 'going', 'first', 'showing', 'first', 'day', 'possibility', 'seeing', 'Lucy', 'Camden', 'Kinkirk', 'horrible', 'death', 'splatter', 'flick', 'appeals', 'character', 'drives', 'wall', 'know', 'lots', 'people', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'House', 'Wax', 'just', 'watch', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'die', 'screen', 'not', 'am', 'only', 'sick', 'person', 'planet.It', 'saying', 'enjoyment', 'Saw', 'II', 'predicated', 'entirely', 'having', 'seen', 'original', 'not', 'recap', 'se', 'begin', 'reminder', 'exactly', 'sort', 'games', 'Jigsaw', 'Then', 'are', 'introduced', 'Detective', 'Eric', 'Mason', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'brought', 'case', 'Jigsaw', 'left', 'message', 'Mason', 'one', 'world-weary', 'cops', 'who', 'enough', 'personal', 'professional', 'problems', 'having', 'psycho', 'killer', 'playing', 'mind', 'games', 'so', 'not', 'want', 'play', 'course', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'issue', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'games', 'games', 'games.So', 'Jigsaw', 'playing', 'little', 'game', 'police', 'monitors', 'see', 'interiors', 'house', 'when', 'Jigsaw', 'trapped', 'group', 'people', 'rats', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'get', 'ahead', 'movie', 'terms', 'introducing', 'characters', 'pointing', 'out', 'already', 'know', 'two', 'One', 'Daniel', 'Erik', 'Knudsen', 'who', 'Marsh', 'son', 'other', 'Amanda', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'who', 'distinction', 'being', 'only', 'person', 'ever', 'have', 'survived', 'one', 'Jigsaw', 'little', 'games', 'game', 'time', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'are', 'breathing', 'toxic', 'gas', 'door', 'outside', 'will', 'open', 'three', 'hours', 'get', 'antidote', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'blood', 'Jigsaw', 'second', 'part', 'game', 'person', 'house', 'will', 'get', 'play', 'own', 'little', 'personal', 'game', 'effort', 'get', 'hands', 'antidote.If', 'are', 'expecting', 'everybody', 'take', 'turns', 'playing', 'own', 'personal', 'game', 'then', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'possibility', 'even', 'get', 'first', 'room', 'more', 'two', 'characters', 'playing', 'game', 'certainly', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'know', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'last', 'time', 'Still', 'Saw', 'II', 'original', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'one', 'strengths', 'film', 'how', 'new', 'way', 'do', 'old', 'things', 'new', 'way', 'also', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'Unlike', 'most', 'contemporary', 'horror', 'films', 'e.g.', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'one', 'better', 'payoff', 'set', 'up', 'least', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'was', 'sitting', 'dark', 'watching', 'end', 'credits', 'So', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'Saw', 'II', 'superior', 'original', 'also', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'watching', 'Saw', 'II', 'usually', 'are', 'when', 'watch', 'sequel', 'horror', 'film', 'liked.Director', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'Butterfly', 'Dreams', 'Identity', 'Lost', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'original', 'story', 'Saw', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'have', 'complaint', 'director', 'writers', 'actors', 'key', 'moments', 'Take', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'minute', 'movie', 'starting', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'situation', 'where', 'want', 'close', 'eyes', 'rather', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'screen', 'just', 'when', 'are', 'close', 'eyes', 'keep', 'shut', 'editor', 'Kevin', 'Greutert', 'overdrive', 'are', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'flashing', 'so', 'quickly', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'rather', 'counterproductive', 'type', 'movie', 'reason', 'ended', 'up', 'rounding', 'down', 'one', 'not', 'what', 'not', 'happen', 'Mitchell', 'character', 'Saw', 'II', 'should', 'deliver', 'goods', 'Hallowee', 'weekend', 'just', 'what', 'horror', 'fans', 'need', 'hear']",Saw II

There's very little in any of the movies that can be called scary, but there is a lot of screaming, a lot of blood, and a lot of clever deaths.  Obviously there are folks who like that sort of thing, and who are willing to suspend a lot of disbelief in order to enjoy it.The pale and pendulous Tobin Bell returns as Jigsaw for this second installment with a brand-new velvet cape and a much meatier role.  He's still riddled with cancer, weaker than ever, but still capable of designing and building complex doomsday devices that appear inspired by equal parts Edward Gorey and Rube Goldberg.  Also, the man seems to have some serious connections in both real estate (how many houses does this guy own?) and toxic gas.Said gas is lethal but takes an hour to work its deadly magic (more or less).  It is being pumped into a multiply booby-trapped house in which eight people are trapped, told via Jigsaw's ponderous voice that antidotes to the nerve agent can be found by enduring a series of tests.  Meanwhile, Jigsaw plays a more personal game with a cop (Donnie Wahlberg), whose son, Daniel, is one of the prisoners in the Mansion O' Macabre.Tobin shows enough restraint to make Jigsaw a sympathetically evil man, but the other actors don't fare quite as well.  This is in keeping with the first film, which cared less about proper acting than it did about its harsh, flourescent stage.  The people in the house scream and fight and utter silly dialogue.  Donnie Wahlberg moans and emotes for his son.  Jigsaw parcels out his trademark bon mots about life, and preciousness, and how much better water tastes when you're about to die.I'm not going to test his theory.  I suspect it might be true, but that's not really the point of the movie, no matter how much Jigsaw tries to cram it down our throats.  The point is, obviously, the games that Jigsaw sets up.

This time Jigsaw, played wonderfully by Tobin Bell, gets the cops by the balls when they come to capture him.  He is no longer able to flee and he has set up one of his finest and most brilliant ""scenarios"" elsewhere.We get to see much more of Jigsaw this time around, allowing us to get a true feel for what he is doing, and why.  We are granted insight into his personal situation and his frame of mind.  Jigsaw uses peoples' ""dirty laundry"" to entrap them and fuel their desire to live, as he did in the first.  He believes, given his experiences, that those who do not appreciate life do not deserve life.The movie is interesting, twisted and creative - and it follows up on the first movie very well.  You even get to briefly revisit the scene from the first movie, which was a great added touch.  The twist near the end of the movie is unexpected and clever.  I doubt that I would be as interested to see a third installment into the series, but this one was certainly solid.The bonus features are also quite interesting.

750564,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00008YOD2,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","I viewed Saw II (I now refuse to say ""saw"" in connection with this series) immediately after watching Saw thanks to my buddy Matt, who bought both DVDs and then let me borrow them. With the first movie fresh in my mind, I slid the disc into my DVD player and held my breath.If Saw was a homage of Se7en, Saw II is a rip-off of Cube.  If you haven't seen Cube, here's the premise: total strangers wake up in a room.  The room is part of a larger structure that is really just an excuse to off the victims one by one with innovative death traps. Cube is one of my favorite movies, because the cube had its own internal logic.  It was an interesting, horrifying existential take on the best and worst of the human condition.Just like Cube, Saw II has the usual cast of characters: the slinky femme fatale (Addison, played by the gorgeous Emmanuelle Vaugier), the stressed out freak (Obi, played by Tim Burd), the neurotic schlub (always the first to die, who cares who plays him), the sweet-as-pie innocent (Laura, played by Beverley Mitchell), the young punk (Daniel, played by Erik Knudsen), the mole (Shawnee Smith reprising her role as Amanda), the leader (Jonas, played by Glenn Plummer) and last but not least the most important character of all: the psychopath (Xavier, played with hulking brutality by Franky G)!  That's right ladies and gentlemen, it's not just enough to put complete strangers in a room full of traps, it helps if you mix it up a bit by adding a slavering nutjob who isn't afraid to get through the traps by throwing other people into them.If Saw II sounds like a completely different film from the first, you're right.  According to IMDB, this WAS another film that was retooled as a sequel to Saw.  It shows.Interspersed between shots of the wacky Funhouse of Death is a psychological standoff between Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and Daniel's father Eric, played by... Donnie Wahlberg! Curse you Wahlberg, was it not enough that you were a muttering bald man in Dreamcatcher?  Is there no end to the spread of your evil?Ahem.  Anyway, Wahlberg spits venom, knocks stuff over, and utterly fails to be convincing as a concerned father, a tough cop, or an actual menace to Jigsaw.  By the end of the movie, I felt pretty bad for `ole Jigsaw.  I mean, all the guy is trying to do is make an entertaining film by killing off a bunch of crooks.  Is that so bad?This film's traps are considerably more elaborate and the gore factor is definitely upped; enough that I was given pause while eating pizza (Will I never learn?  CURSE YOU WAHLBERG!).  The clever riddles that Jigsaw gives Detective Wahlberg are lost in the whip-snap camera shots, rendering the second plot more of a distraction than anything else.  The final twist is more of a cheat, but the real payoff is in knowing what happened to the characters from the first movie.In the end, this sequel can't possibly duplicate the taut thrills of Saw because it's actually two films awkwardly mashed together. And it has Wahlberg. Given the conclusion, perhaps we have finally seen the end of my arch nemesis.But I doubt it.",3,CURSE YOU WAHLBERG!,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,3092,"['viewed', 'Saw', 'II', 'now', 'refuse', 'say', 'saw', 'connection', 'series', 'immediately', 'watching', 'Saw', 'thanks', 'buddy', 'Matt', 'who', 'bought', 'DVDs', 'then', 'let', 'borrow', 'first', 'movie', 'fresh', 'mind', 'slid', 'disc', 'DVD', 'player', 'held', 'breath.If', 'Saw', 'was', 'homage', 'Se7en', 'Saw', 'II', 'rip-off', 'Cube', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Cube', 'here', 'premise', 'total', 'strangers', 'wake', 'up', 'room', 'room', 'part', 'larger', 'structure', 'really', 'just', 'excuse', 'victims', 'one', 'one', 'innovative', 'death', 'traps', 'Cube', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'cube', 'had', 'own', 'internal', 'logic', 'was', 'interesting', 'horrifying', 'existential', 'take', 'best', 'worst', 'human', 'condition.Just', 'Cube', 'Saw', 'II', 'usual', 'cast', 'characters', 'slinky', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Addison', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'stressed', 'out', 'freak', 'Obi', 'played', 'Tim', 'Burd', 'neurotic', 'schlub', 'always', 'first', 'die', 'who', 'who', 'sweet-as-pie', 'innocent', 'Laura', 'played', 'Beverley', 'Mitchell', 'young', 'punk', 'Daniel', 'played', 'Erik', 'Knudsen', 'mole', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'reprising', 'role', 'Amanda', 'leader', 'Jonas', 'played', 'Glenn', 'Plummer', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'most', 'important', 'character', 'psychopath', 'Xavier', 'played', 'hulking', 'brutality', 'Franky', 'G', 'right', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'not', 'just', 'enough', 'put', 'complete', 'strangers', 'room', 'full', 'traps', 'mix', 'up', 'bit', 'adding', 'slavering', 'nutjob', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'get', 'traps', 'throwing', 'other', 'people', 'them.If', 'Saw', 'II', 'completely', 'different', 'film', 'first', ""'re"", 'right', 'According', 'IMDB', 'WAS', 'film', 'was', 'retooled', 'sequel', 'Saw', 'shows.Interspersed', 'shots', 'wacky', 'Funhouse', 'Death', 'psychological', 'standoff', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'Daniel', 'father', 'Eric', 'played', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Curse', 'Wahlberg', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'were', 'muttering', 'bald', 'man', 'Dreamcatcher', 'there', 'end', 'spread', 'evil', 'Ahem', 'Anyway', 'Wahlberg', 'venom', 'knocks', 'stuff', 'utterly', 'fails', 'be', 'convincing', 'concerned', 'father', 'tough', 'cop', 'actual', 'menace', 'Jigsaw', 'end', 'movie', 'felt', 'pretty', 'bad', 'ole', 'Jigsaw', 'mean', 'guy', 'trying', 'do', 'make', 'entertaining', 'film', 'killing', 'off', 'bunch', 'crooks', 'so', 'bad', 'film', 'traps', 'are', 'considerably', 'more', 'elaborate', 'gore', 'factor', 'definitely', 'upped', 'was', 'given', 'pause', 'eating', 'pizza', 'Will', 'never', 'learn', 'CURSE', 'YOU', 'WAHLBERG', 'clever', 'Jigsaw', 'Detective', 'Wahlberg', 'are', 'lost', 'whip-snap', 'camera', 'shots', 'rendering', 'second', 'plot', 'more', 'distraction', 'anything', 'else', 'final', 'twist', 'more', 'cheat', 'real', 'payoff', 'knowing', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'first', 'end', 'sequel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'duplicate', 'taut', 'thrills', 'Saw', 'actually', 'two', 'films', 'awkwardly', 'mashed', 'together', 'Wahlberg', 'Given', 'conclusion', 'perhaps', 'have', 'finally', 'seen', 'end', 'arch', 'nemesis.But', 'doubt']",Saw II

Now, in Saw 2, Det. Donnie Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher, Ransom) is on the case of the Jigsaw Man with Det. Dina Meyer (Stranger Than Fiction, Starship Troopers) and the swat team at his side as they finally capture the Jigsaw Killer, played by Tobin Bell (The Firm. Malice) who is dying of cancer. Wahlberg finds out that there are several people in a room locked up with no way out and they are breathing in a deadly nerve agent that destroys your insides and if they dont make it in time, solve the puzzles, then their all going to die. Once they escape the room, they go on a frantic spree around the house looking for ways to get out and Donnie Wahlberg is trying to get Jigsaw Killer to tell him where the people are because one of those people is his son. A perfect companion movie to the original Saw meshes well with it, notably towards the end. Wahlberg gets some credit for delivering a good performance and Tobin Bell is wonderfully creepy as The Jigsaw Killer.

It wasn't a PG-13 rated teen fest or a remake of a classic 70's horror film either, and while it wasn't perfect, it still managed to deliver the goods with a little bit of originality thrown in.  Saw II picks up where the first film left off, with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) playing another game with a group of people; among whom is survivor Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and the son (Erik Knudsen) of crooked detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) who is forced to play along as well.  Replacing James Wan as director, Darren Lynn Bousman ups the ante in terms of grotesqueness and the design of Jigsaw's game, but the story (originally based on an older story by Bousman that was later transformed into Saw II) isn't close to being as engaging as it was the first time around, and besides Bell, Smith, and Wahlberg; the rest of the cast (including a returning Dina Meyer, along with Glen Plummer, 7th Heaven's Beverly Mitchell, Franky G, and Emmanuelle Vaugier) range from grating to awful.

JIG-SAW is at it again and this time locks up 8 people inside an abandoned, creepy old house. They are trapped in the building and a lethal gas has been pumped into the house for a while. They have exactly 2 hours to each, find a room marked for their attention, crack the game needed to be played and won and inject the antidote into their systems. They also have the option to play each game a little ""further and harder"" in order to find a 2nd Antidote : perhaps for a friend they have made amongst the 8 strangers. Inevitably, going for the 2nd one - may end in death.To add an incredible dimension to the story, DONNIE WAHLBERG, who plays a cop in the film : catches JIG-SAW at the start of the film and then finds out that JIG-SAW has his son in he house. The race against time plays out awesomely in the film, as does the films running time and the fact that each and every character in the house is running closer to death from the lethal gas.DONNIE WALHBERG is awesome, as is the cast of basic unknows. TOBIN BELL (JIGSAW) is incredibly creepy.And finally : if you thought the original ending came at BREAK-NECK-SPEED... this one is going to hit you LIKE A SACK OF BRICKS TRAVELLING AT MACH 1...As is the basic rule for sequels : THE BODY COUNT IS ALWAYS MUCH HIGHER...

What I will shoot for, instead, is showing my admiration with how well they were used within the script. And while I am on the subject, I thought Saw II was very well written.Neither the acting, nor the dialogue was the focus of the movie. Our attention is directed at the ""game."" We needn't focus on feelings of ""Hey that guy was in Showgirls"" or ""Hey that kid reminds me way too much of Malcolm in the Middle."" We are free to enjoy the plot without reservation. What will happen next? What is around that corner? What is on the other side of that door? How will it all end?!Saw II was not the horror film that Saw was. The sequel would be better described as a (relatively) gory suspense movie. Nothing from part 2 made me apprehensive about my own daily routine as part 1 was able to do.

Above everything else, I apprciated the originality and the flair with which it was made.I didn't love 'Saw II'. Not to suggest that it's a bad movie, because it's not. But it's not half as good as its prequel.This time round, bent cop Eric (Donnie Wahlberg) must find a way to help his wayward son Daniel out of serial killer Jigsaw's booby-trapped house of horrors, along with eight other victims, before they inhale too much toxic nerve gas. The catch? Eric must do this remotely, as Jigsaw's not feeling very helpful, and the only link between father and son is a video feed of the victim's progress. It's 'Big Brother' meets 'Silence of the Lambs', although not in a very original way.Put simply, 'Saw II' is a more mainstream and much less satisfying movie than the original. Think of the differences between 'Blair Witch' and 'Book of Shadows' and you'll know what I mean - even if 'Saw II' is infinitely superior to the Blair Witch sequel. Instead of two men caught in a claustrophobic web of hoplessness, we now have nine stereotypical criminals with broadly-drawn personalities (the hooker, the tough guy, the flake, the crazy, the wise one, the kid... and so forth...) running afoul of an increasingly more elaborate and blatantly obvious series of booby traps. There's no real sense of tension to this, and the obvious voyeurism with which director Darren Lynn Bousman shows the various deaths serves only to annoy fans of the careful atmosphere of the original, and bore everyone else - we've seen it all before. Okay, so there's a time limit on how long the kidnap victims can survive with the gas - so what? We already know most of them will die, anyway, so what's the use in getting excited about it?But still, 'Saw II' does have some good points. The overall standard of acting is much, much higher than in the original, with Donnie Wahlberg turning in a convincing and fluid performance as Eric. Tobin Bell as Jigsaw gets a much meatier role in this movie than in the first, and plays it well enough. And while the direction is not at all as successful as the original movie, it's still decent enough, and does lack the superfluous 'fluffing' of the prequel.The dialogue is still awful, mind you, and this is not a movie you need to own. The first twist in the tale can be seen coming from a hundred miles away (although there is a nice link between the first and second movies, here), but the ultimate twist is a satisfying one.A very average horror movie, and one to rent, not to buy.",3,'Saw II - Landing A Paycheck',1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,2519,"['loved', ""'Saw"", 'everything', 'else', 'apprciated', 'originality', 'flair', 'was', 'made.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', ""'Saw"", 'II', 'Not', 'suggest', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'prequel.This', 'time', 'round', 'bent', 'cop', 'Eric', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'help', 'wayward', 'son', 'Daniel', 'serial', 'killer', 'Jigsaw', 'booby-trapped', 'house', 'horrors', 'eight', 'other', 'victims', 'inhale', 'too', 'much', 'toxic', 'nerve', 'gas', 'catch', 'Eric', 'must', 'do', 'remotely', 'Jigsaw', 'not', 'feeling', 'very', 'helpful', 'only', 'link', 'father', 'son', 'video', 'feed', 'victim', 'progress', ""'Big"", 'Brother', 'meets', ""'Silence"", 'Lambs', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'way.Put', 'simply', 'II', 'more', 'mainstream', 'much', 'less', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'original', 'Think', 'differences', ""'Blair"", 'Witch', ""'Book"", 'Shadows', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'even', ""'Saw"", 'II', 'infinitely', 'superior', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'sequel', 'Instead', 'two', 'men', 'caught', 'claustrophobic', 'web', 'hoplessness', 'now', 'have', 'nine', 'stereotypical', 'criminals', 'broadly-drawn', 'personalities', 'hooker', 'tough', 'guy', 'flake', 'crazy', 'wise', 'one', 'kid', 'so', 'forth', 'running', 'afoul', 'increasingly', 'more', 'elaborate', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'series', 'booby', 'traps', 'real', 'sense', 'tension', 'obvious', 'voyeurism', 'director', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'various', 'deaths', 'only', 'annoy', 'fans', 'careful', 'atmosphere', 'original', 'everyone', 'else', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Okay', 'time', 'limit', 'how', 'long', 'kidnap', 'victims', 'can', 'survive', 'gas', 'so', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'most', 'will', 'die', 'anyway', 'what', 'use', 'getting', 'excited', 'still', 'II', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'overall', 'standard', 'acting', 'much', 'much', 'higher', 'original', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'turning', 'convincing', 'fluid', 'performance', 'Eric', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'Jigsaw', 'much', 'meatier', 'role', 'movie', 'first', 'well', 'enough', 'direction', 'not', 'all', 'as', 'successful', 'original', 'movie', 'still', 'decent', 'enough', 'lack', 'superfluous', ""'fluffing"", 'prequel.The', 'dialogue', 'still', 'awful', 'mind', 'not', 'movie', 'need', 'own', 'first', 'twist', 'tale', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'coming', 'hundred', 'miles', 'away', 'nice', 'link', 'first', 'second', 'movies', 'here', 'ultimate', 'twist', 'satisfying', 'one.A', 'very', 'average', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'rent', 'not', 'buy']",Saw II

750591,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00008YOD2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Saw II (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2005)I was one of the people who thought the original Saw was a work of sheer brilliance, one of the best horror films to emerge from the overworked Hollywood machine in years, if not decades, and the herald of a new golden age in American horror. (Well, so far, we've got Hostel, at least.) As Leigh Whanell stuck around to write the script for Saw II, once again co-writing it with the film's director, there seemed a reasonable amount of promise that the sequel would, if not measure up to the original, at least hold its own and be better than the average sequel. And, well, guilty on all counts.This could have actually been entitled Cube, Leigh Whannell-style. It's certainly head and shoulders above either of Cube's painfully anemic sequels. But while Cube is the movie's obvious spiritual daddy, there are certainly a lot more references to old (and more recent) horror films here to choose from; given Whannell's love of intricacy, it's pretty obvious these are conscious, which makes it loads of fun to play spot-the-influence. (The opening scene is a direct homage to one of my favorite recent indie horror films; I knew from the first five minutes that no matter how bad this movie turned out to be, I'd have a soft spot in my heart for it, if only for that.) Technically, it's just as good as the original, which surprised me; the film's major failing lies in... well, I'm getting ahead of myself.Eric Matthews (The Sixth Sense's Donnie Wahlberg), a former beat cop gone to seed while driving a desk, is called out to the site of the latest Jigsaw killing-- one of his informants. Jigsaw has painted a message on the room's wall that names Matthews, but despite this, he's too occupied not only with his other cases, but his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen, recently of The Prizewinner of Defiance, Ohio), who's turning into a juvenile delinquent. Matthews, however, notices the one thing at the crime scene that will blow the case open; it does, but as Matthews finds out, Jigsaw does have a habit of making sure everything, down to the final detail, is planned-- Matthews and his team are forced to solve Jigsaw's next puzzle, which involves eight people stuck in a trapped house-- one of whom is Daniel.The mystery angle of the film, like that of its predecessor, is immaculately done. Everything falls into place (with one odd exception that makes me wonder if there's a deleted scene that contains it) perfectly, and it's a pleasure to watch, even if it wears thin in places; there was at least one aspect of the big picture I figured out at least ten minutes before I should have. The film's main characters are relatively well drawn, though, with the larger cast of this film, that translates to the minor characters getting rather short shrift, especially Laura (Seventh Heaven's Beverley Mitchell, though it's possible there's another deleted scene or two floating about that fills in some unanswered questions we end up with about her). That said, everyone acts the parts they get, and acts them well. Not the actors' fault if the parts are sometimes threadbare. They do the best with what they get, and Whannell and Bousman have come up with a solid cast of underrated Hollywood young-and-beautifuls here; Wahlberg shows that his star turn in The Sixth Sense, as small as it was, was not a fluke, Glenn Plummer (Strange Days) does a fascinating Mos Def impersonation, and Dina Meyer, well, proves that she can, in fact, act her way out of a paper bag.Where Whannell goes horribly, horribly wrong is in letting one of the homages cross the line from homage to ""just downright stupid."" This is something it would be possible to laugh off, of course, except that it concerns the entire climax of the film. Can't say any more than that, but let's just say the set for the final scenes should never have resurfaced.Once again, I find myself reviewing a Hollywood horror film-- for the third time in a month-- that had the potential to be a fantastic piece of work, and blew it in the final minutes. Unlike the others, though, Saw II stays good for a much longer portion of its length than do the others. Not great, but good. *** ",3,"Not the original, but still fun (mostly).",1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,4172,"['Saw', 'II', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', '2005', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'original', 'Saw', 'was', 'work', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'emerge', 'overworked', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'years', 'not', 'decades', 'herald', 'new', 'golden', 'age', 'American', 'horror', 'Well', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Hostel', 'least', 'Leigh', 'Whanell', 'stuck', 'write', 'script', 'Saw', 'II', 'once', 'again', 'co-writing', 'film', 'director', 'seemed', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'promise', 'sequel', 'would', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'original', 'least', 'hold', 'own', 'be', 'better', 'average', 'sequel', 'well', 'guilty', 'counts.This', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'entitled', 'Cube', 'Leigh', 'Whannell-style', 'certainly', 'head', 'shoulders', 'Cube', 'painfully', 'anemic', 'sequels', 'Cube', 'movie', 'obvious', 'spiritual', 'daddy', 'are', 'certainly', 'lot', 'more', 'references', 'old', 'more', 'recent', 'horror', 'films', 'here', 'choose', 'given', 'Whannell', 'love', 'intricacy', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'are', 'conscious', 'fun', 'play', 'spot-the-influence', 'opening', 'scene', 'direct', 'homage', 'one', 'favorite', 'recent', 'indie', 'horror', 'films', 'knew', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', ""'d"", 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'only', 'Technically', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'surprised', 'film', 'major', 'failing', 'lies', 'well', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'myself.Eric', 'Matthews', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'former', 'beat', 'cop', 'gone', 'seed', 'driving', 'desk', 'called', 'out', 'site', 'latest', 'Jigsaw', 'killing', 'one', 'informants', 'Jigsaw', 'painted', 'message', 'room', 'wall', 'Matthews', 'too', 'occupied', 'not', 'only', 'other', 'cases', 'son', 'Daniel', 'Erik', 'Knudsen', 'recently', 'Prizewinner', 'Defiance', 'Ohio', 'who', 'turning', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'Matthews', 'however', 'one', 'thing', 'crime', 'scene', 'will', 'blow', 'case', 'open', 'Matthews', 'out', 'Jigsaw', 'have', 'habit', 'making', 'sure', 'everything', 'down', 'final', 'detail', 'planned', 'Matthews', 'team', 'are', 'forced', 'solve', 'Jigsaw', 'next', 'puzzle', 'eight', 'people', 'stuck', 'trapped', 'house', 'one', 'whom', 'Daniel.The', 'mystery', 'angle', 'film', 'predecessor', 'immaculately', 'done', 'Everything', 'place', 'one', 'odd', 'exception', 'wonder', 'deleted', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'even', 'thin', 'places', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'aspect', 'big', 'picture', 'figured', 'out', 'least', 'ten', 'minutes', 'should', 'have', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'relatively', 'well', 'drawn', 'larger', 'cast', 'film', 'minor', 'characters', 'getting', 'rather', 'short', 'shrift', 'especially', 'Laura', 'Seventh', 'Heaven', 'Beverley', 'Mitchell', 'possible', 'deleted', 'scene', 'two', 'floating', 'fills', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'end', 'up', 'said', 'everyone', 'parts', 'get', 'well', 'Not', 'actors', 'fault', 'parts', 'are', 'sometimes', 'threadbare', 'do', 'best', 'what', 'get', 'Whannell', 'Bousman', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'solid', 'cast', 'underrated', 'Hollywood', 'young-and-beautifuls', 'here', 'Wahlberg', 'star', 'turn', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'as', 'small', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'fluke', 'Glenn', 'Plummer', 'Strange', 'Days', 'fascinating', 'Mos', 'Def', 'impersonation', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'well', 'can', 'fact', 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag.Where', 'Whannell', 'horribly', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'letting', 'one', 'homages', 'cross', 'line', 'homage', 'just', 'downright', 'stupid', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'laugh', 'off', 'course', 'entire', 'climax', 'film', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'set', 'final', 'scenes', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'resurfaced.Once', 'again', 'find', 'reviewing', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'film', 'third', 'time', 'month', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'fantastic', 'piece', 'work', 'blew', 'final', 'minutes', 'others', 'though', 'Saw', 'II', 'good', 'much', 'longer', 'portion', 'length', 'do', 'others', 'Not', 'great', 'good', '***']",Saw II

It was, in my opinion, the closest anyone, with the exception of Rob Zombie with House of 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, has ever come to a horror classic in at least a decade, maybe even longer.  Can lightning strike twice?  Absolutely.This is one of those rare occasions where the sequel builds upon the greatness of its predecessor.  The first Saw was amazing, but Saw II is phenomenal.  It boasts an even better cast, a faster pace and a chilling storyline that's by no means a stale rehash of what we saw in the original.  On top of that, the ""kill scenarios"" are even smarter and, yes, even more gruesome than what we saw a year ago.Within the opening minutes of the movie, the Jigsaw Killer's caught.

750594,A2ZF1WW0Z0ZXQD,B00008YOD2,Robert VerBruggen,"[1, 2]","Last year, Saw rocked the horror-film world. With an interesting plot - a serial killer named ""Jigsaw"" kidnaps people, then makes them do horrible things to earn their release - and some incredibly intense scenes, Saw was a breath of fresh air for a too-often clich&eacute; genre.Saw II doesn't fare nearly as well, though it eliminates the low-budget, flat-out bad acting of the original. Drenched in gross-out gore, shallow characters and a now-worn plot, it can't live up to the legacy of its predecessor.The original movie certainly had its fair share of blood, but the sequel tops it. The scripts has the characters shot in the head, bleeding from the eyes, rolling in vats of hypodermic needles, cutting their wrists, burning to death, slicing their arms to pieces and passing out from deadly gas. All this is fine and dandy, but it comes at the expense of character development.One of the first movie's best aspects was that it told the audience why each character was chosen for kidnapping by Jigsaw. One is a private investigator, another a drug addict. Jigsaw uses his ""puzzles"" to make his victims face their flaws and, if they can stomach it, do what they need to to survive.In Saw II, however, there is but passing mention of why the victims are there. There's the drug dealer, the suicidal woman (the drug addict from the first movie who, apparently, has found new vices to replace the old ones Jigsaw helped her overcome), etc., but the viewer never relates to any of them.Finally, the recycled plot can't make the movie worthwhile. There is a new twist - a detective arrives at a crime scene to find a message from Jigsaw, then catches the killer. Jigsaw, it turns out, is a dying cancer patient who wants to force others to see the value of the survival instinct.From there, though, it's Saw all over again. Before his capture, Jigsaw and his accomplices kidnapped some people and, you guessed it, drugged them up and put them in a room in an abandoned warehouse. There's a clock ticking, and when it runs out they'll all die.Even the movie's very first scene, the murder the detective later finds the message at, is a rehash of a scene from Saw. A man (instead of a woman like last time!) has a device strapped to his head that will kill him if he doesn't unlock it first. The key is in the person's eye, where last time it was in a dying human body's stomach. And the machine will drive spikes through the new victim's brain instead of ripping his jaw apart.In short, Saw II is good for some skin-crawling, nauseating scenes, but it can't match the intelligence, character development and innovation of its predecessor.",3,Lacks the originality and character development of the first one,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,2638,"['Last', 'year', 'Saw', 'rocked', 'horror-film', 'world', 'interesting', 'plot', 'serial', 'killer', 'named', 'Jigsaw', 'people', 'then', 'do', 'horrible', 'things', 'earn', 'release', 'incredibly', 'intense', 'scenes', 'Saw', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'too-often', 'clich', 'eacute', 'II', ""n't"", 'fare', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'low-budget', 'flat-out', 'bad', 'acting', 'original', 'Drenched', 'gross-out', 'gore', 'shallow', 'characters', 'now-worn', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'legacy', 'predecessor.The', 'original', 'movie', 'certainly', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'blood', 'sequel', 'scripts', 'characters', 'shot', 'head', 'bleeding', 'eyes', 'rolling', 'vats', 'hypodermic', 'needles', 'cutting', 'wrists', 'burning', 'death', 'slicing', 'arms', 'pieces', 'passing', 'out', 'deadly', 'gas', 'fine', 'dandy', 'expense', 'character', 'development.One', 'first', 'movie', 'best', 'aspects', 'was', 'told', 'audience', 'why', 'character', 'was', 'chosen', 'kidnapping', 'Jigsaw', 'One', 'private', 'investigator', 'drug', 'addict', 'Jigsaw', 'puzzles', 'make', 'victims', 'face', 'flaws', 'can', 'stomach', 'do', 'what', 'need', 'survive.In', 'Saw', 'II', 'however', 'passing', 'mention', 'why', 'victims', 'are', 'there', 'drug', 'dealer', 'suicidal', 'woman', 'drug', 'addict', 'first', 'movie', 'who', 'apparently', 'found', 'new', 'vices', 'replace', 'old', 'ones', 'Jigsaw', 'helped', 'overcome', 'etc.', 'viewer', 'never', 'them.Finally', 'recycled', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'new', 'twist', 'detective', 'arrives', 'crime', 'scene', 'find', 'message', 'Jigsaw', 'then', 'killer', 'Jigsaw', 'out', 'dying', 'cancer', 'patient', 'who', 'force', 'others', 'see', 'value', 'survival', 'instinct.From', 'there', 'Saw', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'capture', 'Jigsaw', 'accomplices', 'kidnapped', 'people', 'guessed', 'drugged', 'up', 'put', 'room', 'abandoned', 'warehouse', 'clock', 'ticking', 'when', 'out', ""'ll"", 'die.Even', 'movie', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'murder', 'detective', 'later', 'message', 'rehash', 'scene', 'Saw', 'man', 'instead', 'woman', 'last', 'time', 'device', 'strapped', 'head', 'will', 'kill', ""n't"", 'unlock', 'first', 'key', 'person', 'eye', 'where', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'dying', 'human', 'body', 'stomach', 'machine', 'will', 'drive', 'spikes', 'new', 'victim', 'brain', 'instead', 'ripping', 'jaw', 'apart.In', 'short', 'Saw', 'II', 'good', 'skin-crawling', 'nauseating', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'intelligence', 'character', 'development', 'innovation', 'predecessor']",Saw II

She is supposed to be there to help the rest who are new to the twisted game of Jigsaw's. There is ending scene as well in the movie that connects one and two in another way that I won't spoil but will answer all your questions you had for the two unfortunates in the first film.So yes the writing is in ways strong and keep you there in front of the screen. It does keep you caring about what will happen and you pray the main character's son that is one of the new players of Jigsaw's game survives. Also what makes this movie worth watching is the fact that you finally get to know the mysterious Jigsaw a lot better than you ever did know and he becomes less ominous- feeling than he was in the first and just...a sick (both mentally and physically) person that hasn't been caught yet.The characters are strong-ish. There are just too many characters I feel in this movie, so there isn't enough time for any of them to be too strong. The only ones that truly stood out was the boy, mainly because the main character is his father and trying to save him, and the survivor of the first movie who knows a little too much- I felt. Then of course Jigsaw. The film was sort of messy though because there shouldn't have been that many characters.Part one I felt was stronger in this case because there were less characters so thus they had a chance to grow into stronger personalities as the movie rolled on. And also Jigsaw having an ominous feel just made part one a lot more creepy than the second. The writing in the first was also more stronger just cause again less characters. But in both endings, I was surprised. I have to admit that. Both endings I didn't even think about till they were played.So overall this was a good follow- up to the Saw part one, but it doesn't match up to the strength of part one either. I highly recommend part one and also this one just because in part two they add a little more to the story everyone who liked Saw 1 should know.",3,Better Than Most Horror Sequels I Have Seen...,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,2302,"['Most', 'fans', 'Saw', 'one', 'will', 'admit', 'sequel', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'most', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'also', 'admit', 'one', 'better', 'sequels', 'come', 'out', 'horror', 'film', 'most', 'have', 'seen.Saw', '2', 'finds', 'actually', 'very', 'clever', 'way', 'connect', 'part', 'one', 'two', 'together', 'bringing', 'back', 'woman', 'part', 'one', 'who', 'survived', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'help', 'rest', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'twisted', 'game', 'Jigsaw', 'ending', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'one', 'two', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'will', 'answer', 'questions', 'had', 'two', 'unfortunates', 'first', 'film.So', 'yes', 'writing', 'ways', 'strong', 'keep', 'there', 'front', 'screen', 'keep', 'caring', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'pray', 'main', 'character', 'son', 'one', 'new', 'players', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'Also', 'what', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'fact', 'finally', 'get', 'know', 'mysterious', 'Jigsaw', 'lot', 'better', 'ever', 'did', 'know', 'less', 'ominous-', 'feeling', 'was', 'first', 'just', 'sick', 'mentally', 'physically', 'person', ""n't"", 'been', 'caught', 'yet.The', 'characters', 'are', 'strong-ish', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'feel', 'movie', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'be', 'too', 'strong', 'only', 'ones', 'truly', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'boy', 'mainly', 'main', 'character', 'father', 'trying', 'save', 'survivor', 'first', 'movie', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'much-', 'felt', 'Then', 'course', 'Jigsaw', 'film', 'was', 'sort', 'messy', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'many', 'characters.Part', 'one', 'felt', 'was', 'stronger', 'case', 'were', 'less', 'characters', 'so', 'thus', 'had', 'chance', 'grow', 'stronger', 'personalities', 'movie', 'rolled', 'also', 'Jigsaw', 'having', 'ominous', 'feel', 'just', 'made', 'part', 'one', 'lot', 'more', 'creepy', 'second', 'writing', 'first', 'was', 'also', 'more', 'stronger', 'just', 'cause', 'again', 'less', 'characters', 'endings', 'was', 'surprised', 'have', 'admit', 'endings', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'till', 'were', 'played.So', 'overall', 'was', 'good', 'follow-', 'Saw', 'part', 'one', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'strength', 'part', 'one', 'either', 'highly', 'recommend', 'part', 'one', 'also', 'one', 'just', 'part', 'two', 'add', 'little', 'more', 'story', 'everyone', 'who', 'liked', 'Saw', '1', 'should', 'know']",Saw II

There are others invovled in the game and there are traps along the way, which were pretty gruesome, but not as shocking as the original.  Saw isn't supposed to have a real plot, and I think trying to keep this single trap going paralleling the fairly predictable plot line made the movie sort of boring at times.

I am as pleased with this sequel as I was with the original, bringing blood and horror back to horror where it belongs.  Hopefully, 'SAW III' will rise from the ashes of this grisly phoenix to entertain horror aficionados again.Detective Eric Matthews has cornered and caught John (Tobin Bell) the jigsaw killer.  Or has he?  When John tells Matthews another game is in progress, and shows Matthews footage that his son has been recruited for the game, Matthews is forced into Jigsaw's nightmare of trying to unravel the clues.The trap?  Several people are locked inside a dilapidated old house.  (The atmosphere of the house is sinister and disturbing, but not as filthy as the bathroom in the original.)  The doors to the house will open in three hours, but the players are already breathing in a poison gas that will kill them within two hours.  The players include Matthews' son Daniel (Erik Knudson) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who previously escaped one of Jigsaw's traps and is forced to play again.  John's tape informs them that there are antidotes hidden throughout the house, one of which is in the safe in the middle of the room they are in.  He tells them they all possess the combination to the safe; that the numbers are in the back of their mind.  Once they figure out what they all have in common, they will know why they are there.  X marks the spot (again).  Let the game begin.Amanda tries to warn her fellow players that she has dealt with Jigsaw's traps before, and that they must follow the rules, but the fear of death and the clash of personalities have the players all running for their own lives.  Needless to say, the house has many lovely traps awaiting our game-players.  We get to observe not only the players desperate struggle to survive, but witness Detective Matthews degeneration into his own madness as he struggles with John's mental games in order to save his son's life.Without the 'whodunit' value of the original 'SAW', the surprise in 'SAW II' comes strictly from the clues of the game, not a 'whodunit' but 'what was the most important clue'?  It is still a puzzle for the viewer to solve, and I will go no further on revealing any hints.  Suffice to say, pay attention, and get ready to be shocked, stunned, grossed out, and gagging with exquisite horror and delight as the blood begins to flow.  Watch for the peek at the original bathroom.I must add, I have never felt so drawn to a psychopathic killer in my life as I am to John.  I would kiss Jigsaw's cancer-withered lips and toes if I could find him.  I just hope he doesn't find me first.One more quick note.  When I saw Donnie Wahlberg in 'The Sixth Sense', I wondered how an awful ex-pop singer (the word singer used loosely) could turn into such a great actor.  While his performance in 'The Sixth Sense' was superior, he plays his role as Detective Matthews quite skillfully.  Kudos also to Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith.If you loved 'SAW', you are going to love 'SAW II'.  If you love blood, guts, building terror, violent deaths, desperately selfish personalities, and cunning killers, this movie is for you.  Definitely a 'buy', 10 stars.

One thing Saw had going for it was somewhat engrossing characters. Saw II contains your average roster of vaguely developed trap fodder who predictably start lashing out at one-another before dying telegraphed deaths.The lead girl Amanda, once a somewhat believable jittery addict, is now of a rather cardboard stoic nature. I assume I was supposed to care about Eric's son, but he might as well have been a secondary character. The most developed character was the ""Jigsaw killer"" himself, and you can trick anyone into thinking a character has depth if they have a terminal illness.What have we left... Oh yes, the ending. Saw II has one of the most convoluted, contrived endings I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie. It's as forced as a pineapple in a paper shredder, and makes about as much sense as that prospect.

There are good twists and turns in the story: Why has the group been kidnapped? What do they all have in common? What do they have in common with the cops that are looking for them? Will any of the kidnapped crew escape? Is there a definitive tie-in with the first movie? All ultimately revealed in this B-actor filled second edition of the Jigsaw killer chronicles.The B-actors selectively put in some pretty good performances. Donnie Wahlberg (Detective Mathews), Shawnee Smith (Amanda) and Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) are great. Franky G (Xavier) is fairly believable at best and the other kidnapees are standard B appearances.There are also some police-work plot holes/believability issues that take some of the realistic desperation away from Saw II.

Centered around a cop ( played by Donnie Wahlberg) who Jigsaw has targeted and is the common link between the people Jigsaw ( John ) has locked up in a room in an abandoned house, the movie delivers alot more than the original. The fact that Jigsaw has several more victims in this movie makes it much more interesting. We see Jigsaw who is dying of cancer and very bitter, still wanting to teach people the meaning and value of life. This movie like the first, forces people to see exactly what they would do to save their own life. With each victim's dying scene, it makes you wonder what WE would actually do to save our life.

Don't get me wrong, the first one was great, but this one has more suspense. I won'ty explain the plot, since other have already done that. It has more gore than the last one, and it also shows a few past events from the first movie for anyone who hasn't seen the first one.Also, there's an added twsit at the end that I feel the need to explain to anyone who may be confused. This is what I'm talking about: At the end of the movie, the police officer Matthew's crew see a safe open, and inside of it is Matthew's son with an oxygen mask. A lot of people were confused by this because of the video cameras that showed what Matthew's son and the others are doing to get out of this old house/prison they're stuck in, which were shown on the computers. And as we've seen in the video, Amanda knocks out Matt's son. But how could he end up in the safe? Well, here's my theory: Whatever the video cameras viewed was TAPED and was put in the computers by Jigsaw himself. After Amanda knocked Matt's son out, he put him in that safe where no one could hear him, even though Jigsaw and Matt were right next to the safe. Matt and his crew were watching something recorded, perhaps it was recorded the night before or something.But why did Amanda knock out Matt's son? Well, first thing's first: Matt ties up Jigsaw, (who has severe cancer), and forces him tell Matt the directions to the house his son and the others are in. But he has to brutally beat him before he can get any info. out of him, which kills Jigsaw. When Matt enters the house, he steps into a giant, and obviously old, bathroom - the same bathroom from the first one, where the 2 main characters were tied up in. He finds a tape recorder and plays it, and it's the voice of Amanda. She talks about how after Jigsaw helped her get over her drug addiction by horrible means, she was inspired by him, and was determined to become his apprentice - which she did. He taught her all of his moves and skills and whatnot. So, she has come to take his place. After the tape ends, a being comes out the tub behind him and knocks him unconcious. Who is it? It's her. As a side note, the reason she didn't kill his son is because he, obciously, passed the ""test"" so he hopefully learned his lesson. It also shows us that Amanda was the one who set up the enitire trap, and this was a test of what she learned from JigsawI know I kind of got off track with the previous paragraph, but I figured that since I said that Amanda knocked out Matt's son, I might as well, explain why, which also kinda spoils the ending. Still, I got my point across with the 2nd paragraph. So if you're a fan of the first movie, I highly doubt you'll be dissapointed with this sequel. Sequels to movie usually suck, but this is one of those exceptions.

750613,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B00008YOD2,SteakSalad101,"[3, 4]","To be completely honest, I had VERY low expectations for Saw 2. I had watched the first film, and LOVED it. I loved how James Wan and Leigh Whannell were able to create such a creepy film with such a simple set. I loved the brilliant psychological warfare between two individuals who start out calm but grow angry with each other soon after. I loved the flashback sequences. Truth be told, I loved everything about it, and I was upset to then learn of three sequels (and probably a fourth) to such a classic horror film.But anyway, since I had loved the first so much, one day I found myself at Blockbuster and decided to give the sequel a chance. I had nothing else to do. I could barely speak after watching it. I had just walked out of my home theater room with the memory of one of the best and most well-made sequels I've ever had the pleasure of watching.""Saw 2,"" quite simply, is basically the first film on steroids. From the very first scene (which, by the way, was so revolting I had to set my giant movie theater butter popcorn bowl on the table next to me) Saw 2 will take your hands and lead you into a world of nightmare that you can't escape from until the end credits arrive on your screen 90 minutes later.The story is simple to follow yet complex to dive into. Jigsaw locks eight people in a house full of traps, and they have two hours to find a way out before a lethal nerve gas flowing through the house kills them like the EBOLA virus. Meanwhile, Detective Matthews, a cop, apprehends Jigsaw with a team. And, it just so happens, one of the eight trapped in that house is Eric Matthews' son.Saw 2 has everything the first film had and beyond. The gore is up there as a 9 or 10 on the gore scale, while I'd give the first film maybe a 7. Remember the psychological warfare that ensued between Adam and Lawrence in the first film? Well, it's magnified 100x in ""Saw 2,"" between Jigsaw and Detective Matthews, and the eight unlucky individuals trapped inside the house. The acting is incredibly top-rate and soars past the first film in acting talent. Everyone in the cast does a GREAT job and makes the film seem that much more realistic. The direction and editing is superb (better than the first) and we now seriously know Leigh Whannell can seriously write a damn good movie, even though the screenplay for the first film was better. Apart from that, the only complaints I could have for ""Saw 2"" is that it isn't as creative or inventive as the first was, but who says it has to be? It's a sequel--it is merely carrying on the story where the first left off. The second complaint would be that it isn't scary...at all. It's just a brilliant suspense film that will have you cringe in disgust at the deliciously cleverly twisted film before your eyes. And for me, that's enough.The twist at the end is also one of the biggest shockers I've ever witnessed watching a film. You think the one at the end of ""Saw 1"" is big? You ain't seen nothing yet. And go ahead--keep trying to guess the ending throughout watching ""Saw 2."" I guarantee you it'll go in the exact opposite direction of what you're thinking of.Overall--do what your love for the first film tells you to do.

As per normal, rather than rehash plotline I'll focus on my thoughts on this film.The suspense just isn't there. Throughout most of the film I never felt pulled in. Sure in a couple of the bloody scenes I winced a bit. However, the emotional rollercoaster isn't there.Amanda: early on I knew something was up with her. She knew too much and acted too out of place with the other misfortunate souls. You knew something was coming. The end wasn't much of a surprise.The first 80% of the film I almost felt as if I was watching CSI. It felt like that in set up and presentation. Only in the end does it breakout and get some flair to it.Bloody it is. Seeing the venus flytrap again was nice. The torching of the one victim in the boiler one could see that one coming a mile away. I did though like the one girl getting her hands stuck in the glass box. That was brutal.Donnie Wahberg puts in a decent performace as a corrupt cop who in the end well, gets a surprse.It struck me as interesting with windows around the house. No one went for one.I liked the tie in with the original movie that we arrived back in the same nasty basement room.Is this worth a purchase? No. I suggest renting it.

O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","The blood games continue in ""Saw II"", as a SWAT team has finally tracked down the Jigsaw killer and raids his hideaway, but an obstacle remains to carting the killer off to jail: a new game is in progress, and from his warehouse base-of-operations, Jigsaw holds the keys to the fates of not two but eight new victims caught in a new deathtrap that occupies an entire re-inforced, inescapable house.The 'participants' in this latest game are a more disparate, and often highly hostile, group as compared to previous captives, and it appears that the more sympathetic characters are going to have threats other than the ones Jigsaw's assembled to deal with.  And complicating matters for the police who have to try and navigate this unexpected development without getting anyone killed is this: one of the eight is the teenage son of the detective in charge.  The challenges are ghastly, the secrets behind all this sinister, and the complexity of the whole saga really begins getting driven up here.  Another universally great job by the movie's actors and actresses, including Tobin Bell as Jigsaw and Shawnee Smith as Amanda, Jigsaw's first 'return victim', who survives her ordeal in the original 'Saw' only to be captured again.

I wish they would have kept Jigsaw in the shadows more. Some of the suspense of the character was taken away from all of the screen time. This movie didn't have the individualized traps like the first one. The group had to take on the challenges together. It was still a good movie, but it didn't have the same amount of intensity the first one did. It tried to create it by using the nerve gas as a ticking time bomb, but the feel of this movie is just not up to the scope of the first one. I didn't care for Doonie Wahlberg's character. He seemed like a jerk, not as good of a character as Detective Tapp in the first one. There's no outside force on these characters like the first one. There is the nerve gas, but you never know how much time they have left. The characters aren't as developed, and they don't seem to grow as the movie unfolds. There are a few interesting traps, but they seem to hate each other instead of Jigsaw. The ending was a little predictable, unlike the first.

There is blood, gore, yelling, screaming, and many plot twists that make ""Saw 2"" a worthy film to watch if your in the mood to be scared. In this movie a police officer's son is kidnapped by Jigsaw and it is heartbreaking to see the lengths in which a parent will go to save their son.Other sequels follwed ""Saw 2"" and most were huge boxoffice, but this and the original are the best in the ""Saw"" franchise.

750621,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00008YOD2,Terry Mesnard,"[4, 5]","Wow. After seeing all of the negative reviews roll in, with only a couple good ones, I was kind of worried about Saw II. It didn't exactly have the best track record. The script started as the director's own script that had absolutely nothing to do with the Saw universe. And then when Lion's Gate decided to make a sequel they found this script and thought it could fit into the universe, so they gave it to the original screenwriter and he took a stab (pun not intended but I'll go with it) at making it work for their sequel. Normally when you have a script and then have other people work on it, you get a conflict of interest and the script falls apart. See Jurassic Park 3 and its huge list of screenwriters to get an idea of that.BUT! I thought this movie was great for a couple of reasons. A lot of times, with sequels, you could simply switch in a different villain and name the movie Bob's House of Horror and it would work. I mean, seriously, the Jason movies? The Michael Myer movies? Change those guys with someone else and it would work. There's no real connection outside of the killer to the series. And then there are movies that are intricately connected. The Scream trilogy is. Not saying that all three Scream movies are great, but they are intricately connected. A good sequel acknowledges the first movie and then finds a way to change how you viewed it. It changes things, raises the stakes and makes you rethink what happened in the first film. Scream 2 and 3 did this and so does Saw II.The big worry for me going into Saw II was that it would be there simply to cash in on the success of Saw. Sure, the Jigsaw killer would be there, up to his old tricks. But that would be it. It'd be another Jason, another Michael Myers. I'm happy to report that is not the case. Instead it is connected at a fundamental level to the first one. It answers some lingering questions about the killer, it brings in a character from the first one and it...well I don't want to spoil it.  There are a couple twists.  I saw the majority of them coming.  The big one lacked the punch of the first one's dead body on the floor, but it definitely was more realistic and fit in perfectly with the story.  It was a good twist, but it didn't make my jaw drop.It is incredibly gory. Incredibly. I don't think overall its as intense as the first film, it definitely has its cringe-worthy moments. There is a scene toward the end that mimicks the nominal scene from the first film (not in the same way but its definitely an homage to it) that I almost didn't watch. I did the kind of squint your eyes so you can just barely see it manuever. Thinking about it makes me shudder.But what Saw I did, Saw II does bigger and better for the most part.  The characters were more fully developed, the dialogue was better and the production values were higher.  It was nice, after the first film's 18 days of filming, that they spent more time and money getting it right.  The premise still can't live up to the original with the two people chained in a room, without knowing where they are or who they are with set up. That scene is so claustrophobic, so intense that just making it 8 people in a house doesn't do it justice.  In fact, it wasn't as intense as the first one.  More in your face and bloody, yes.

750624,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00008YOD2,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[3, 3]","Director:  Darren Lynn BousmanCast:  Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, Franky G, Glenn Plummer, Dina Meyer, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Beverly Mitchell, Erik Knudsen.Running Time:  93 minutesRated R for grisly violence and gore, terror, language and drug content.Sequels, with a few exceptions, have a tendency to be very bad. In the wake of all this being let down by them, many critics were initially unimpressed with the idea of a clever little horror film like ""Saw"" to have a sequel. It seemed like too much of a way to cash in a successful revenue and good reception of the original and while this one isn't as good it is a formidable continuation.  ""Saw II"" does everything wrong that the first film did right. First of all, this film tells the story of a group of eight random people inside one of Jigsaw's ""Fun houses"", if you will, with a dangerous nerve gas slowly creeping into their systems. They only have 3 hours to find a way out, or they all die. Now, what made the first film great is that it built tension and suspense on the fact that everything was a mystery. The two men locked inside of a bathroom had no more of an idea of what was going on than the people watching the film. As the film went on, there was a little more information leaked, a little more progression with each minute that ticked by. And the fact that there were only two people instead of eight made it easier to know the characters, know why they were doing what they were doing, etc. Instead, ""Saw II"" is just basically a glorified theatrical version of ""Survivor"" with blood, guts, and gore.The first film also didn't reveal much of the surrounding environments outside of the bathroom. That's what made it scary; you didn't know who or what was watching them, why they were in there, or even if there was any hope that they would get out. In Saw II, a police team actually captures jigsaw (Tobin Bell), and throughout the film, there are cuts to detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), who must investigate the crime scene in order to save his own son, who happens to be trapped with the several others at the unknown location, about to be killed by the deathly gas.  Everything is just so silly when compared to the first film. It's like Leigh Whannel completely let his film go the way of ""quick cash-in"", and if he had a little more input on this film, I think it could have been much better.  Saw II does do some things right, such as the way people die and nailing the violence factor right on the head. There is plenty of gore in this film, and some of the twisted things the people have to do are pretty insane (seeing a girl crawl around in a pool of syringes is terrifying). But, the violence isn't handled well. Violence isn't something that is supposed to be there just to be there. It should have a purpose (such as scaring audiences!).  What director Darren Lynn Bousman and screenwriter Leigh Whannell (who wrote the first ""Saw"") attempt to do is create a scenario similar to the excellent ""The Cube"" and create a villain as menacing as Jon Doe in ""Seven""; however, they fail to do either and ""Saw II"", despite its redeeming qualities, becomes an overly grisly, horrifically gory tale that isn't all that surprising or entertaining.",2,Saw II  (2005),1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,3247,"['Director', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'BousmanCast', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'Franky', 'G', 'Glenn', 'Plummer', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'Beverly', 'Mitchell', 'Erik', 'Knudsen.Running', 'Time', '93', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'grisly', 'violence', 'gore', 'terror', 'language', 'drug', 'content.Sequels', 'few', 'exceptions', 'have', 'tendency', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'wake', 'being', 'let', 'down', 'many', 'critics', 'were', 'initially', 'unimpressed', 'idea', 'clever', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'Saw', 'have', 'sequel', 'seemed', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'cash', 'successful', 'revenue', 'good', 'reception', 'original', 'one', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'formidable', 'continuation', 'Saw', 'II', 'everything', 'wrong', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'right', 'First', 'all', 'film', 'story', 'group', 'eight', 'random', 'people', 'one', 'Jigsaw', 'Fun', 'houses', 'will', 'dangerous', 'nerve', 'gas', 'slowly', 'creeping', 'systems', 'only', 'have', '3', 'hours', 'find', 'way', 'out', 'die', 'Now', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'great', 'built', 'tension', 'suspense', 'fact', 'everything', 'was', 'mystery', 'two', 'men', 'locked', 'bathroom', 'had', 'more', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'people', 'watching', 'film', 'film', 'went', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'information', 'leaked', 'little', 'more', 'progression', 'minute', 'ticked', 'fact', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'instead', 'eight', 'made', 'easier', 'know', 'characters', 'know', 'why', 'were', 'doing', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'etc', 'Instead', 'Saw', 'II', 'just', 'basically', 'glorified', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Survivor', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore.The', 'first', 'film', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'much', 'surrounding', 'environments', 'bathroom', 'what', 'made', 'scary', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'why', 'were', 'there', 'even', 'was', 'hope', 'would', 'get', 'out', 'Saw', 'II', 'police', 'team', 'actually', 'jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'film', 'are', 'cuts', 'detective', 'Eric', 'Matthews', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'must', 'investigate', 'crime', 'scene', 'order', 'save', 'own', 'son', 'who', 'be', 'trapped', 'several', 'others', 'unknown', 'location', 'be', 'killed', 'deathly', 'gas', 'Everything', 'just', 'so', 'silly', 'when', 'compared', 'first', 'film', 'like', 'Leigh', 'Whannel', 'completely', 'let', 'film', 'go', 'way', 'quick', 'cash-in', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'input', 'film', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Saw', 'II', 'do', 'things', 'right', 'such', 'way', 'people', 'die', 'nailing', 'violence', 'factor', 'right', 'head', 'plenty', 'gore', 'film', 'twisted', 'things', 'people', 'have', 'do', 'are', 'pretty', 'insane', 'seeing', 'girl', 'crawl', 'pool', 'syringes', 'terrifying', 'violence', ""n't"", 'handled', 'well', 'Violence', ""n't"", 'something', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'just', 'be', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'purpose', 'such', 'scaring', 'audiences', 'What', 'director', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'screenwriter', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'who', 'wrote', 'first', 'Saw', 'attempt', 'do', 'create', 'scenario', 'similar', 'excellent', 'Cube', 'create', 'villain', 'as', 'menacing', 'Jon', 'Doe', 'Seven', 'however', 'fail', 'do', 'Saw', 'II', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'overly', 'grisly', 'horrifically', 'gory', 'tale', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'entertaining']",Saw II

750626,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00008YOD2,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 0]","The financial rewards reaped by the low-budget original ""Saw"" guaranteed a sequel. Fortunately, it also meant that the perpetrators of the first movie were given a little more money and time to hone their movie's rough edges. The resulting ""Saw II"" is a superior movie, and my favorite of the first three.Jigsaw's master plan to teach his victims their life lesson is to trap a group of interconnected people in a booby trap laden house. In the opposite end of town, he is apprehended by an angry, bitter, Donnie (""I'm Not Mark"") Whalberg. But then the trick of the Saw movies comes into play. Whalberg's son is in the house of horrors and all the other victims have a connection to the crooked cop that sent them to jail. All Whalberg has to do is just stay where he is, Jigsaw cooly (and superbly played by Tobin Bell) instructs him, and the son will be given back to him. (Along with the movie's catch phrase ""Oh yes, there will be blood."")Of course, the house where all the others are trapped is tricked out with multiple killing games and the police at Jigsaw's hideout are reduced to watching as, one by one, they meet their gory demises. This is another point where ""Saw II"" betters its origin. I found it increasingly hard to care what happened to the to protagonists in the first film, and got to the point where - except for the final twist - I was finding the movie to be almost laughable. In ""Saw II,"" there are so many people in so much trouble that it turns into a game of ten little Indians; who is going to get picked off next, and how? Can Whalberg control his rage at Jigsaw and get his safely returned son as reward? Add to the mix the movie's relentless pacing, and ""Saw II"" became both a horror/gore fest and a suspense movie.There is also a tight twist at the end to set up ""Saw 3"" (even if I believe this to be the superior movie), and all sorts of loose ends that can appear in the plans for two more in the franchise.

750627,A2O97GKCSISM3F,B00008YOD2,Tony's reviews,"[0, 1]","When the first one ended, I was positive the series was gonna be good. Plus the back story on Jigsaw was a nice touch. Seeing someone learning to help him with his work was a nice one too. Other than that I don't have much else to say about this one, mostly good things if I did though.August 8, 2010) I recently watched/purchased the two disc special edition-I wish they would've stuck with the clear case/dust cover with these first two films of the 2-disc. The storyline is pretty good-Donnie Wahlberg is a cop and father to a son who no longer understand each other. But when his son is thrust into a Jigsaw game-he is forced to change his tone. In the process he meets Jigsaw/Tobin Bell-you get a glimpse of his past and how he became so demented-the further chapters elaborate on this perfectly as well.The 2-disc is better than the one disc because of the special features-making of featurettes, commentaries, and a few other odds and ends. The first trap in this one made me cringe-what the subject had to do was freaky. The twist at the end was wild just like the first SAW. Which edition do I recommend? Personally, if you like the Saw series like I do, you'll want to get both the clear case and 2-disc of both the first two films, at least. The uncut edition didn't change much here either, except a couple very subtle, and I do mean subtle changes when the swat team infiltrates Jigsaw's lair, that scene was slightly changed, other than that, I didn't see much different.If I could grade this film, I'd give it an A-",4,I like this one too...,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,1530,"['When', 'first', 'one', 'ended', 'was', 'positive', 'series', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'good', 'back', 'story', 'Jigsaw', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'Seeing', 'someone', 'learning', 'help', 'work', 'was', 'nice', 'one', 'too', 'Other', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'else', 'say', 'one', 'mostly', 'good', 'things', 'did', 'though.August', '8', '2010', 'recently', 'watched/purchased', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition-I', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'stuck', 'clear', 'case/dust', 'cover', 'first', 'two', 'films', '2-disc', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'good-Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'cop', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'understand', 'other', 'when', 'son', 'thrust', 'Jigsaw', 'game-he', 'forced', 'change', 'tone', 'process', 'Jigsaw/Tobin', 'Bell-you', 'get', 'glimpse', 'past', 'how', 'became', 'so', 'demented-the', 'further', 'chapters', 'elaborate', 'perfectly', 'well.The', '2-disc', 'better', 'one', 'disc', 'special', 'features-making', 'featurettes', 'commentaries', 'few', 'other', 'odds', 'ends', 'first', 'trap', 'one', 'made', 'cringe-what', 'subject', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'freaky', 'twist', 'end', 'was', 'wild', 'just', 'first', 'SAW', 'Which', 'edition', 'do', 'recommend', 'Personally', 'like', 'Saw', 'series', 'do', ""'ll"", 'want', 'get', 'clear', 'case', '2-disc', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'least', 'uncut', 'edition', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'much', 'here', 'either', 'couple', 'very', 'subtle', 'do', 'mean', 'subtle', 'changes', 'when', 'swat', 'team', 'Jigsaw', 'lair', 'scene', 'was', 'slightly', 'changed', 'other', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'different.If', 'could', 'grade', 'film', ""'d"", 'give', 'A-']",Saw II

The script of the sequel, which was originally written as a thriller unrelated to `Saw,' surely borrows many elements from other films including `Saw' (yes of course), but still is effective as suspense with much gore, largely due to its better editing and sound effects.[ONE THING] you must do before watching `Saw II' is to see the original, in which one serial killer Jigsaw spears. It is very important for some characters re-appear in the sequel, and they play a considerably significant role in `Saw II.' And it would be a good test for you - if you find the original too violent and gory, you don't have to see the sequel, which is equally violent and gory.The sequel again shows the characters trapped in an old dirty room - this time eight persons - for the reasons only Jigsaw knows. These elaborate tricks are set up by the same Jigsaw, who again keeps on watching these confined characters through some media, but this sequel has a nice additional touch. For the two police detectives (Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer) are allowed to share the same experience as audience in the way I should not reveal.But the escape from the deadly house wholly depends on the actions of the trapped people, All the lethal traps or props are prepared in the most sinister (or nasty) way you can think of. Still, if you have seen the films of this genre, it is not difficult to anticipate what is coming next. At least you can sense something is there, even though admittedly some of the scenes involving these tricks always looks painful, or are really scare-inducing at times.However, as some viewers have said perhaps too rightly about the improbability of `Saw II' and its story, these characters often behave in the most stupid way, and the script is full of plot holes. Why don't they realize the importance of the hints Jigsaw gave right before them?  Why do they do unnecessary things like you know what? But booby traps are called booby traps because they don't catch wise people, so let's forget the incomprehensible behaviors of some characters, and not-so-good acting of some players.The ending (no spoilers) of `Saw II' is certainly surprising, but you may call it silly. But I found the original's ending surprising and silly, and in this sense the sequel did a fine job, a rare thing you can find these days when you see dreadfully silly sequels like `Cube 2.' `Saw II,' which benefits from bigger budget and more calculated editing, is a success as far as its visceral sensation goes. For all the dull explanations about Jigsaw's motives or many other atrociously philosophical nonsense, `Saw II' doesn't hide the fact that the film is all about the 'game,' about having fun, about feeling sensation and shock, and as such it is quite good.",3,Another Game of Death from Jigsaw; Experience Shock and Visceral Sensation Again,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,2954,"['Considering', 'very', 'short', 'pre-production', 'period', 'enormous', 'pressure', 'filmmakers', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'feeling', 'surprise', 'hit', 'Saw', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'Saw', 'II', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'script', 'sequel', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'thriller', 'unrelated', 'Saw', 'surely', 'many', 'elements', 'other', 'films', 'including', 'Saw', 'yes', 'course', 'still', 'effective', 'suspense', 'much', 'gore', 'largely', 'due', 'better', 'editing', 'sound', 'effects', '[', 'ONE', 'THING', ']', 'must', 'do', 'watching', 'Saw', 'II', 'see', 'original', 'one', 'serial', 'killer', 'Jigsaw', 'very', 'important', 'characters', 're-appear', 'sequel', 'play', 'considerably', 'significant', 'role', 'Saw', 'II', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'test', 'find', 'original', 'too', 'violent', 'gory', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'sequel', 'equally', 'violent', 'gory.The', 'sequel', 'again', 'characters', 'trapped', 'old', 'dirty', 'room', 'time', 'eight', 'persons', 'reasons', 'only', 'Jigsaw', 'elaborate', 'tricks', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'same', 'Jigsaw', 'who', 'again', 'keeps', 'watching', 'confined', 'characters', 'media', 'sequel', 'nice', 'additional', 'touch', 'two', 'police', 'detectives', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'are', 'allowed', 'share', 'same', 'experience', 'audience', 'way', 'should', 'not', 'reveal.But', 'escape', 'deadly', 'house', 'wholly', 'actions', 'trapped', 'people', 'lethal', 'traps', 'props', 'are', 'prepared', 'most', 'sinister', 'nasty', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'Still', 'have', 'seen', 'films', 'genre', 'not', 'difficult', 'anticipate', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'least', 'can', 'sense', 'something', 'there', 'even', 'admittedly', 'scenes', 'involving', 'tricks', 'always', 'painful', 'are', 'really', 'scare-inducing', 'times.However', 'viewers', 'have', 'said', 'perhaps', 'too', 'rightly', 'improbability', 'Saw', 'II', 'story', 'characters', 'often', 'behave', 'most', 'stupid', 'way', 'script', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'importance', 'hints', 'Jigsaw', 'gave', 'right', 'Why', 'do', 'do', 'unnecessary', 'things', 'know', 'what', 'traps', 'are', 'called', 'booby', 'traps', 'do', ""n't"", 'catch', 'wise', 'people', 'let', 'forget', 'incomprehensible', 'behaviors', 'characters', 'not-so-good', 'acting', 'players.The', 'ending', 'spoilers', 'Saw', 'II', 'certainly', 'surprising', 'may', 'call', 'silly', 'found', 'original', 'ending', 'surprising', 'silly', 'sense', 'sequel', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'rare', 'thing', 'can', 'find', 'days', 'when', 'see', 'dreadfully', 'silly', 'sequels', '2', 'Saw', 'II', 'benefits', 'bigger', 'budget', 'more', 'calculated', 'editing', 'success', 'as', 'far', 'visceral', 'sensation', 'dull', 'explanations', 'Jigsaw', 'motives', 'many', 'other', 'atrociously', 'philosophical', 'nonsense', 'Saw', 'II', ""n't"", 'hide', 'fact', 'film', ""'game"", 'having', 'fun', 'feeling', 'sensation', 'shock', 'such', 'quite', 'good']",Saw II

Like the first film, ""Saw II"" is smart, intense but gorier and you'll see how cleverly it ties in with the first ""Saw."" Jigsaw is up to his old tricks again. It's a new game with new horrific traps aimed at people who need to be more appreciative of their lives. And there is also another unbelievable ending that you won't see coming.The movie is based around Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and John Kramer (a.k.a ""Jigsaw"")(Tobin Bell). You get to see a lot more of Jigsaw in this film, and both Whalberg and Bell do a fantastic job with their roles. Detective Matthews is called out by the psychopathic Jigsaw as he investigates a Jigsaw crime scene. Not long after, Matthews and the rest of the police/SWAT team burst into an old building where Jigsaw is practically waiting for them. When confronting Jigsaw, Matthews finds out that he has a huge problem on his hands. Jigsaw has captured his son, along with 7 other people and is holding them in an old abandoned house where they are breathing in a deadly nerve gas. It's Jigsaw's latest game. In three hours, the door to the house will open, but everyone will die within two hours. To avoid death, they must survive the traps around the house and acquire the antidotes hidden within them. But there is also a clue that Jigsaw gives to obtain one of the antidotes locked in a safe; ""You all possess the combination to the safe. Think hard. The numbers are in the back of your mind."" This clue makes for some pretty horrific and intense moments in the film.All 8 of these people have more in common than they realize. Once you find this out, it's easier to understand why detective Matthews has been thrown into this vicious game to save his son. Jigsaw knows all about who Matthews really is. Yes, basically two games that tie together are going on at the same time. While the 8 people are trying to survive in the house, Matthews must play his own game with Jigsaw right in front of him. All Jigsaw wants is some time to chat with him. If he simply does that, then he will see his son again. For Matthews, it's harder than it seems and the desperation and anger that overcomes him will lead him to another ultimate test along with the haunting answer to the question: ""What is the cure for cancer?""The characters in the film are all portrayed well. Tobin Bell as the cancer-ridden Jigsaw is calm, cool, collected, yet creepy, sick and twisted. Donnie Wahlberg gives us a tough, angry, desperate cop in Eric Matthews. He does a great job and his emotion is clearly felt. Matthews' son Daniel (played by Erik Knudsen) comes off as a hard-ass at the start of the movie, yet when kidnapped, turns into a somewhat innocent, emotional kid in the face of the others. Shawnee Smith is back as Amanda, which was a nice twist to the film. She is an essential character to the movie and we get to see a lot more background on this infamous Jigsaw trap survivor from the first film. One of the best characters in the movie who gets the horror flowing nicely in the abandoned house is Xavier (Frankie G.). He's a big, self-centered, muscular tough guy who shows viciously how far he will go to save himself. He pulls out all the stops toward the end of the film and is involved in my favorite scene from the movie pertaining to the number on the back of his neck. Then there's Obi (Timothy Burd), an interesting character who played a pivotal role in why they're all in the house. His role is small, but very memorable. Glenn Plummer plays Jonas, one of the more rational members of the group. All the characters compliment themselves nicely in the movie; a good solid cast.The traps of course, help make the movie. The film opens with my personal favorite. A man named Michael; a snitch/informant wears a Venus flytrap-style death mask that will close up around him unless he retrieves the key from in his eye socket and unlocks it. It's a perfect grisly intro that gives you the impression that ""yes, there will be blood."" Besides the gas house trap itself that makes everyone go crazy, you'll also see the gun-in-the-peephole trap, the syringe pit, the oven fire trap and the blood-soaked wrist-cutting trap. There's even a trap ready for the SWAT team who dash into the old building where Jigsaw is during the first part of the movie. One guy gets his legs broken and sparks fly everywhere.""Saw II"" is a bit more fast-paced than the original, and though I like the original a little better, this sequel still delivers. Writer/Director Darren Lynn Bousman does a great job, and Leigh Whannell (writer and actor in the first Saw) came back to help write this sequel and does a fantastic job. If you've seen the first ""Saw,"" you must see this one. Bloody and suspenseful, this is a horror movie that will have you wondering what will happen next throughout the film. Check it out.

Infact saw was not even intended for mainstream theatre release when it was in it's initial project stage. The success of saw :-) saw to it that 2 and 3 came out. The success is due to the originality of the story, the plotting, the ingenious wretched instruments of torture/death and the gore. I  have not seen gore of such a raw nature in any other movie. It is clinical and methodical gore'n'guts. saw 2 is the best of the 3 (I haven't seen 4 yet).Traps include: death mask aka venus head trap; needle pit;wrist slasher;body oven, peep hole eye pistol.Extras on dvd is pretty cool. There is the ""the traps of Jigsaw"" which shows every trap from story board, production design and sfx level. And there is also a director's audio commentary.There is a ""making of"". You'll be better off renting this one. I don't think you want to be watching this one every week else you'll end up with insomnia.This one is more psychological and the torture traps/rigs are awesome. The SFX team a cool job. Just watch the movie for what it is. If you are squeamish about blood and gore, you won't be renting this one out anyway. The Critics on many sites have panned the whole saw series. I think it's unfair to judge the movie as bad from the angle that there is too much gore. you have to first be a fan of the genre and then judge it within the genre of blood'n'guts films. Thing is saw is so cutting edge, new age and barrier breaking that I dont think there's been a movie like saw. The images are pretty gruesome and not for the faint heartened. saw2 has a cool ending. I won't say more than that. This movie brings together a group of ppl caught in a house. 2 leads the movie into 3.

750636,A34HYQ9BQZPE78,B00008YOD2,William Dorfer,"[0, 0]","Following where the original started, ""Saw 2"" is an excellent follow-up to the smash hit that started the franchise. And like the original, this movie manages to blend its police-story crime elements with the suspense of a thriller and the tension and graphic content of horror.By now, Jigsaw is taken into custody and being interviewed by the police, all while a new group of his victims are locked in a house and must find a way out before time runs out and they meet their death. Sounds interesting, right? Well if it sounds good, seeing it will take it to another level entirely, as the dirty fingers and chipped nails on the front cover suggest.In comparison to the first ""Saw"", this movie is more graphic, gory and twisted. The small fire chamber, the needle pit and the wrist-cutting puzzle box all make up some gruesome scenes that really show you what a great horror movie can do. I'm sure at least one of those scenes, or others, will have you squirming! For me personally, it was the fire chamber scene that left me shuddering.Also, while the original ""Saw"" had a great, dirty look to it, especially something in the use of the camerawork, this one takes it up again! While the original did have a gritty, raw feel to it, as opposed to polished camerawork of say, a foreign horror film, ""Saw 2"" gives the original a run for its money in that field.In ""Saw 2"", the camerawork gets even rawer and grittier, giving it the shaky feel you may see when you're in a nightmare. There are some moments where, dare I say, it almost has a psuedo-snuff feel to it, much like the underground film series ""August Underground"". Dear Lord, I'll save that for another day!But anyway, ""Saw 2"" is still able to find a genius balance between a smart police story and a gritty torture-thriller display. I really give the writers of this film credit, because not too many films can have that dual-personality medium and pull it off so well.Well, that about wraps up this review. If you wanna watch ""Saw 2"", I might recommend you watch the original ""Saw"" before, just so you can understand what's going on. Hey, make it a double feature! Anyway, if you liked the original, or want to watch a ""Saw"" film, you'll love this!

The acting is solid, the scares are real, and the viewer is trying just as hard as Donnie Wahlberg's Detective Matthews to solve the mystery. What's most amazing is that all the clues really are right before your eyes.At the beginning of the film, Jigsaw has committed another grisly murder, and left his calling card for Detective Matthews to track him down. Matthews reluctantly takes the case and quickly locates Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) in his warehouse lair. But this is only the beginning of another one of Jigsaw's intricate games.Now eight people, including Matthews' son, are trapped in a house where deadly nerve gas is seeping through the walls and into their bodies. As the police try to locate the house and figure out a way to rescue the prisoners, they are also trying to figure their own way out together, while fighting amongst themselves to find out what connects them all.The suspense in this film is palpable and Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is one of the best horror franchise ""bad guys"" in years. His twisted sense of morality: ""Those that don't appreciate life do not deserve it"" is the kind of terrible explanation that makes a psychopath real and frightening.The twists that this film takes are surprising and show the kind of intelligence that the majority of horror schlock coming out these days is severely lacking.The DVD extras are truly spectacular. The viewer gets a look at how the set designers laid out every one of the various traps in the film, from the needle pit to the furnace trap. All the props are also examined (the bat with nails in it, etc.).
