Soon there is panic all over and urgent help is needed. But the whole movie is totally boring. The  characters are not interesting,  there is absolutely no one you will really like. Donna Mills is playing a  kindergarden teacher who seems to have lost a child in the fire. This is  the only highlight in this movie. But mysteriously no one is really  concerned about it but Donna. This drama is just a nice try to make a good  action movie.",2,Quite boring,950832000,"02 18, 2000",2000,532,"['movie', 'forrest', 'worker', 'who', 'accidently', 'big', 'fire', 'cigarette', 'Soon', 'panic', 'urgent', 'help', 'needed', 'whole', 'movie', 'totally', 'boring', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'absolutely', 'one', 'will', 'really', 'like', 'Donna', 'Mills', 'playing', 'kindergarden', 'teacher', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'child', 'fire', 'only', 'highlight', 'movie', 'mysteriously', 'one', 'really', 'concerned', 'Donna', 'drama', 'just', 'nice', 'try', 'make', 'good', 'action', 'movie']",Fire VHS
