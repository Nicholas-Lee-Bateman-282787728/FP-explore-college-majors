One a Captain played by Michael Rennie and the other a signalman played by Jeffrey Hunter. Now I may have missed something but I didn't see a clear line drawn between the two, only a possible hint of it. And there is suppose to be a line. The movie starts a little slow but soon gets into the rousing action of British ships tracking a German Raider that has sunk several ships. Good action, special effects, and acting make it well worth seeing. Jeffrey Hunter and Michael Rennie do very well in their respective roles as well as the support cast. I recommend it for the whole family. This is good and different enough from other WWII movies that I think it is worth owning.Synopsis:A young sailor becomes romantically involved with a woman he meets on a train while he is on furlough during World War I. They spend a night together after deciding to get married the next day. The next day they don't marry after she decides it won't work. Shift to action at sea during World War II around twenty years later. Jeffrey Hunter is a young signalman aboard a destroyer escorting a convoy. His ship and another ship are sent to catch a German Raider. His ship is sunk and he escapes off the German Raider with a rifle while it is conducting repairs at the Galapagos. The Germans are trying to get underway before the British ships reach them. Hunter wreaks havoc with the repair crew by sniping them and greatly hampering their efforts. - C.

1046116,AKKSHEGRQVQRK,B000MGBLJG,Great Movie Addict,"[29, 30]","Maybe not the greatest war flick ever made, but a worthy example of some highly competent work by Director Ray Boulting, one of the principles involved in the evolution of British Lion Films Corp. Though Boulting's later films were often little more than generic comedies (including some work with Peter Sellers), this film is a good example of his earlier, more ""morally earnest"" work. The hero, who undertakes a lone mission from which he knows he will not return, is contrasted with both a flaky English officer and a fatalistic German commander. Some years ago I read somewhere that this story of a single hero seaman was based on an actual incident from World War II. In any case, the combat sequences are superbly produced - no wonder, since Boulting himself saw similar combat during the period this story covers. The sniping sequence is beautifully executed and edited -- you really do feel as if you're up there in the rocks when the artillery barrage surrounds you. The DVD is among the best b&w transfers around - clean, clear, film-like, with little of the digital over-sharpening often seen with monochrome; and the camera work is exceptional. Performances from all are quite good. Jeffrey Hunter looks even better here than he did in John Ford's ""The Searchers"" - with looks and talent like his, one questions why Hunter didn't achieve superstar status. The plot itself seems as if it had undergone a major revision at some point: the beginning and ending sequences seem as if they were designed to support some message about heroism and individual responsibility. But the message is murky, as if the writers weren't quite willing to make the commitment. Had they done so the film likely would have been raised to a near-classic level.  The middle action portion is superior to the start or finish and works well as an action movie on its own. You might get an idea about the script's supposed overall purpose by watching the alternate British ending, which was not shown in the USA (the original British title was ""Single-Handed""). Deficiencies of message aside, this is a memorable combat film that apparently cost a King's ransom to produce. It's a simple tale, compellingly told.",4,"A long-lost Fox treasure -- great DVD print, too",1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,2197,"['Maybe', 'not', 'greatest', 'war', 'flick', 'ever', 'made', 'worthy', 'example', 'highly', 'competent', 'work', 'Director', 'Ray', 'Boulting', 'one', 'principles', 'involved', 'evolution', 'British', 'Lion', 'Films', 'Corp', 'Boulting', 'later', 'films', 'were', 'often', 'little', 'more', 'generic', 'comedies', 'including', 'work', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'film', 'good', 'example', 'earlier', 'more', 'morally', 'earnest', 'work', 'hero', 'who', 'lone', 'mission', 'will', 'not', 'return', 'contrasted', 'flaky', 'English', 'officer', 'fatalistic', 'German', 'commander', 'years', 'read', 'somewhere', 'story', 'single', 'hero', 'seaman', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'incident', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'case', 'combat', 'sequences', 'are', 'superbly', 'produced', 'wonder', 'Boulting', 'saw', 'similar', 'combat', 'period', 'story', 'sniping', 'sequence', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'edited', 'really', 'do', 'feel', ""'re"", 'up', 'there', 'rocks', 'when', 'artillery', 'barrage', 'DVD', 'best', 'b', 'w', 'transfers', 'clean', 'clear', 'film-like', 'little', 'digital', 'over-sharpening', 'often', 'seen', 'monochrome', 'camera', 'work', 'exceptional', 'Performances', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'even', 'better', 'here', 'did', 'John', 'Ford', 'Searchers', 'looks', 'talent', 'one', 'questions', 'why', 'Hunter', 'did', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'superstar', 'status', 'plot', 'had', 'major', 'revision', 'point', 'beginning', 'ending', 'sequences', 'seem', 'were', 'designed', 'support', 'message', 'heroism', 'individual', 'responsibility', 'message', 'murky', 'writers', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'willing', 'make', 'commitment', 'Had', 'done', 'so', 'film', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'near-classic', 'level', 'middle', 'action', 'portion', 'superior', 'start', 'finish', 'well', 'action', 'movie', 'own', 'might', 'get', 'idea', 'script', 'supposed', 'overall', 'purpose', 'watching', 'alternate', 'British', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'USA', 'original', 'British', 'title', 'was', 'Single-Handed', 'Deficiencies', 'message', 'aside', 'memorable', 'combat', 'film', 'apparently', 'cost', 'King', 'ransom', 'produce', 'simple', 'tale', 'compellingly', 'told']",Sailor of the King

I am a Michael Rennie fan, and so I found the first 20 minutes of the movie just as interesting as the rest of the film and I disagree that the movie has a 'slow' opening. The unexpected and illicit affair, especially for the WWI era in which it takes place, between Rennie's character and the young, proper English girl is crucial to the rest of the plot, so if it had been omitted or if she had agreed to marry him, it would have changed this movie to another average WWII adventure film rather than hint at the amazing coincidence of life that puts an unsuspecting Rennie commanding his own son, the product of that affair and also a young man totally oblivious to who is father is, 20 years or so later in another world war.This brings me to my only complaint of the movie, which is why I didn't give it a full 5 stars. I watched both the British ending and the American ending, and I can appreciate both. However, at no time is any recognition fully realized that the young sailor is actually Rennie's son from that 5-day affair over 20 years ago, and I wish the connection between them could have been made more definitely, since it is really at the crux of the movie.As an American, I like the American ending, which is more upbeat and hints that sometime in the future this family (including the mother) might finally have some resolution, but it is not fully realized and we don't know for sure if it will ever happen. I also appreciate the British ending, more somber but still interesting yet also wasting the opportunity to fully draw together the relationship between Hunter's and Rennie's characters at the end of the movie. It is a bit frustrating, but the movie is otherwise quite good.At any rate, if you are a Michael Rennie fan or a Jeffrey Hunter fan you will enjoy this movie and I recommend it, also recommending it for those who enjoy war movies filmed from a different perspective than Americans usually see. This is a British war movie and so we get to see our allies in WWII dealing with the German navy, which is a refreshing point of view.",4,Interesting premise not fully realized,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,2134,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'enough', 'buy', 'add', 'collection', 'am', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'fan', 'so', 'found', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'interesting', 'rest', 'film', 'disagree', 'movie', ""'slow"", 'opening', 'unexpected', 'illicit', 'affair', 'especially', 'WWI', 'era', 'place', 'Rennie', 'character', 'young', 'proper', 'English', 'girl', 'crucial', 'rest', 'plot', 'so', 'had', 'been', 'omitted', 'had', 'agreed', 'marry', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'movie', 'average', 'WWII', 'adventure', 'film', 'rather', 'hint', 'amazing', 'coincidence', 'life', 'unsuspecting', 'Rennie', 'commanding', 'own', 'son', 'product', 'affair', 'also', 'young', 'man', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'who', 'father', '20', 'years', 'so', 'later', 'world', 'war.This', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'watched', 'British', 'ending', 'American', 'ending', 'can', 'appreciate', 'However', 'time', 'recognition', 'fully', 'realized', 'young', 'sailor', 'actually', 'Rennie', 'son', '5-day', 'affair', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'wish', 'connection', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'definitely', 'really', 'crux', 'movie.As', 'American', 'like', 'American', 'ending', 'more', 'upbeat', 'hints', 'sometime', 'future', 'family', 'including', 'mother', 'might', 'finally', 'have', 'resolution', 'not', 'fully', 'realized', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'will', 'ever', 'happen', 'also', 'appreciate', 'British', 'ending', 'more', 'somber', 'still', 'interesting', 'yet', 'also', 'wasting', 'opportunity', 'fully', 'draw', 'together', 'relationship', 'Hunter', 'Rennie', 'characters', 'end', 'movie', 'bit', 'frustrating', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'quite', 'good.At', 'rate', 'are', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'fan', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'recommend', 'also', 'recommending', 'who', 'enjoy', 'war', 'movies', 'filmed', 'different', 'perspective', 'Americans', 'usually', 'see', 'British', 'war', 'movie', 'so', 'get', 'see', 'allies', 'WWII', 'dealing', 'German', 'navy', 'refreshing', 'point', 'view']",Sailor of the King
