Some of the things in the plot weren't new, but the movie is made in a smart, very funny and correct way. I loved actors, i loved the plot itself and I loved pretty much everything about it. It wasn't too obvious as for how the movie was going to end and I was questioning myself quite a few times. I really don't understand how the movie can have 3 stars rating in general. It should be at least 4. Yes, some of the effects could be done in a better way, but that's what makes this movie much like old beloved comedies. It's not a movie that you should miss. Watch it.

Cheap CGI of island; plane flying; jungle (probably a prop set of fake palm trees all shot from different angles to make it look bigger or at different locations). Really bad acting and I'm not going so far as to even call it acting. Nothing but stand, or sit, one line clich&eacute;s (all they could memorize at a time between edits). In fact 90% of the movie was just standing/sitting with talking. ""Lord of the Flies"" ripoff of stranded adults acting like children forming adversarial groups (basically just lots of brief shouting and stupid costuming as a substitute for action or meaningful storyline). Usual romantic tease that was just juvenile. What brief attempt at parody was like a cheap 1930s slapstick. Van Damme, for the few minutes he was in his cameos, looked more sad than funny.Ties JCVDs recent other movie, ""Enemies Closer"", as equally cheap, dumb and forgettable.

1692468,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B00HVFA2TQ,Joe Smart,"[1, 3]","Amiable but mostly unfunny comedy about a bunch of advertising firm employees who go on a team building exercise on an island with a guru played by Jean-Claude Van Damme.  After things start to go wrong the situation shifts into Lord of the Flies mode, with the employees splitting into two groups, one led by a megalomaniac exec who keeps his followers high on hallucinogenic berries and declares himself a god and the other, led by a wimpy but far more level headed employee who has actual wilderness training and is the only chance any of them have of getting off the island.  This is one of those movies that thinks it's hilarious but it rarely elicits any actual laughs--the one exception being a couple of Kristen Schaal's scenes (Flight of the Concords; The Daily Show) which she very likely wrote herself.  The rest of the movie just isn't funny--although it is pretty easy to sit through.  Blacklist fans might be interested since this also stars the largely unknown Megan Boone--suggesting that it might not be the writing that makes her the least interesting character on that show--she's also the least interesting character here.

Almost too a fault.But I still didn't like this movie.The story -- about a corporate team-building retreat that goes awry when the employees get stranded on an island -- is an obviousLord of the Fliesspoof, but it also steals bits here and there from a lot of other sources, includingRushmore,Severance,SyrupandApocalypse Now. In spite of this kind of patchwork approach to plotting, the tale is about as commonplace as it gets, with Adam Brody playing our lead, a cute, smart, clever guy who can't seem to get ahead at work or with the cute, smart, clever girl of his dreams that works there, in spite of just how obviously cute, smart, and clever he is. Will he ever get the girl that he is obviously meant to be with? Will he defeat the office sleazeball?A few bits work here and there, but the humor is mostly tepid, made even more lukewarm by the cookie-cutter characters and by a script that is mind-bogglingly ridiculous when it isn't being painfully predictable.

1692471,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00HVFA2TQ,Matthew Scott Baker,"[2, 4]","Ok, I have to confess up front that I scoffed at the idea of Jean-Claude Van Damme doing comedy.  I mean, let&#8217;s face it:  action stars can usually get away with one-liners in their films, but straight-on comedy?  That&#8217;s almost unheard of.  Thankfully, my misgivings were unfounded.  WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is a hilarious, smartly written romp that will force you to respect Van Damme for more than just butt-kicking!The premise of this film is initially what drew me to watch it.  I love the idea of a bunch of a city-raised office drones getting stranded on an island.  There are SO MANY things you can do with that idea, and director Rob Meltzer does not disappoint.  He fleshes out a great story with funny characters and insane situations.WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is shot well, and the production value appears high.  The cast is superb, with Adam Brody playing the lead as Chris, a mousy office geek who wants to get ahead but has no assertiveness.  Chris&#8217;s nemesis is Phil, portrayed by the ever-talented Rob Huebel.  Both actors do an excellent job with their roles, as do the rest of their supporting cast.  Van Damme only has a small part in the film, but he delivers his lines with true zest and good timing.  The result is a comedic ensemble that would rival Saturday Night Live&#8217;s best of any year.What really wins me over with WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is the story that plays out on the island.  Part LOST, part LORD OF THE FLIES, the insanity reaches mountain-peak highs once a hallucinogenic herb is introduced to the survivors.  I found myself laughing and cringing at the same time due to the craziness that ensues.  I would bet you&#8217;ve never seen anything like this before.WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is a major win for me, and I highly recommend giving it a look if you&#8217;re looking for zany comedy.

Also, the cast was really likeable.  The main problem was that it just wasn't that funny.  A lot of the humor just tries way too hard and winds up coming off like a 12 year old wrote it.  Also, everything seemed to happened way too fast.  It felt like they were only on the island for like 5 minutes then all of a sudden, everything turns to s***.  There are a few subtle funny moments which are the ones that are most likely to make you laugh.  JC again, is the highlight of the movie.  I was worried that he was gonna try way too hard to be funny but I thought he did a good job.  All in all though, it's decent but not great.

not wildly funny,has some moments here and there.It's the type of film that you have to overlook the plot holes and let reality take care of itself.The story finds a group of dysfunctional advertising types in your typical dysfunctional advertising setting.There are two rivals,Phil,a pompous exec,and Chris a guy with more talent than Phil, but with way more ambition.Comes a day when they have to pitch a product to a must have client and Phil steals Chris's idea for his own.The Boss next day calls everyone together to announce they are all going on a bonding and teamwork experience to a  deserted island.Their &#34;guide&#34; will be JCVD,who is posing as an ex military guy,but who is in reality a para wanna be and very much off the wall.Next day they fly to a tropical island,and as JCVD is showing them around two girls report seeing a tiger.They look and don't find it.While standing near a rocky precipice overlooking the sea,and explaining the impossibility of a tiger being there,JCVD is jumped not once but three times by the animal.The third time they both fly into the drink and disappear.As time goes on and the panic subsides the group divides into two factions, with the most going to Phil's side,while Chris has three with him.Chris soon shows that he knows more about survival than anyone and his group gets along pretty well,while Phil's degenerates into a one man God show.Chris finds out he needs the radio from the plane they came in, but Phil's group guards it.They also come across a quite wounded JCVD and nurse him back to health.JCVD cannot walk, so they are forced to wheel barrel him around the jungle.JCVD lays-guard as Chris and his buddies go for the radio.Phil's group ends up capturing Chris's group,while Chris manages to escape.Just as one of his friends is about to be executed,Chris swoops down with some home made wings.Phil and Chris go toe to toe.Just as Chris has won, Phil is about to sneak a cheap shot at Chris when JCVD comes out of no where to do a flying kick on Phil,in a send up from Bloodsport.As this has been happening, a ship finally has come into view,the group gets its attention,and they are saved.JCVD gets arrested by the authorities for impersonating a military man(and who goes under at least three different aliases).Chris and the group go home.Back at the office Chris gets the promotion he has always wanted,but realizes his experience has taught him that he doesn't want a career there any longer,and quits.The film ends as Phil is alone on the island writing a &#34;hate&#34; letter to Chris.JCVD does have some cute comedic moments such as his tiger attack,his playing of his character at the end like he is some needy child,his Bloodsport take off,his animal warning calls during the radio steal and others.JCVD has always said he'd like to do comedy,and here we are.As I said you have to over look alot plot wise,like how in the world did the group get to a deserted tropical island so fast,where did the tiger come from,how does JVCD move around so well when he's so wounded and others.Don't ask just go with the flow.His real life son Kris and daughter Bianca also make appearances.JCVD comes and goes and surprisingly the rest of the cast make up well for his lack of screen time.Finally I have to comment about the trailer for the film,showing JCVD's tiger attack.This was  a good gag that should have been kept out of the trailer.As a result I was  waiting for it to happen in the movie and when it did it the punch was completely gone.BAD move.Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.All in all a better film than I expected.It's an Office Space type environment meeting Lord of the Flies,with wild card JCVD thrown in
