I bought one movie as a gift and the other for myself. I watched it during the week of Christmas and loved it. Although I'm an adult, like most other adults there will always be the child side to us. With so much violence and dark stuff all over TV, the world and news, what a nice thing to just sit back and enjoy something fun and entertaining. Sure, the Muppets does have some violence (especially Miss Piggy who might need some anger management classes), but we don't take it seriously. No more so than a pig in love with a frog.

Even Paul Williams' music seems to be lacking without the collaborative genius of Henson.There are a few chuckles here and there--brought about mostly by the newish character of PePe the Prawn--but I'd have to guess that Henson wouldn't be proud of this effort.And what's weirdest to me is that ALL of the Muppet's voices seem to have changed--not just Kermit's, who obviously sounds different these days since he isn't being performed by Henson.
