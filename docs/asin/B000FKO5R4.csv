992136,A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ,B000FKO5R4,"Daniel S. ""Daniel""","[4, 4]","**1/2 2005. This film was based on Matthew F. Jones'sDeepwater: A Noveland was written and directed by David S. Marfield. A young man is heading to Wyoming when he meets Herman Finch, a man who seems to have the town of Deepwater in his pocket. Soon, two persons who had dared contradict Finch are found murdered. DEEPWATER is a B movie with two well-known actors such as Peter Coyote and Lesley-Anne Warren in its cast, the other actors being either promising newcomers (Lucas Black) or TV performers (Mia Maestro and Xander Berkeley). The result is no more than average but, still, DEEP WATER is worth seeing if you're curious. The film belongs to this special kind of movies that make you say after its ending : "" Gee! now I know why the director insisted on that scene at this moment or filmed this action with a shaking camera "" and so on. So every detail, scene or dialogue of DEEP WATER is meaningful. In short, I had the strange feeling to have had the opportunity to be in the head of Michael Myers for a while with DEEP WATER.

He steals a car and winds up saving the life of a guy named Herman Finch played by Peter Coyote (The 4400, Sphere). When Black is arrested because he stold the car Coyote bails him out and has Black do work around his Motel that he owns. Mia Maestro (Alias, Poseidon) plays Iris a maid who Black falls for. Coyote has Black train for a fight in which the two will go head to head against each other. Black doesnt want to fight Coyote and he soon finds out that Coyote might be a dangerous person since dead bodies happen to pop up. Interesting but story gets tiresome as it goes along until the ending. Black is in nice form but he needs to work more on his acting. I wasnt feeling his performance in this. Coyote livens the movie up as usual and the beautiful Mia Maestro has her beauty but she's done much better.

It is also coupled witha newcomer and various parties each coming up with their bestguesses on the underlying motives and on what is truely happeningaround them.  ""Best guess"" is the key phrase here, in building thestory and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.Mia Maestro's character, is remarkable and speaks volumes from hervisual impact, natural feel, rapport built and presence with theother characters, turning them real.Peter Coyote, as Finch does a wonderful job as a veteran mobsterwho is a key figure in the underlying operations of a casino on anNative reserve,  collecting illegal debts, receiving payoffs,loansharking to local honest businesses, skimming profits for topbosses, and more. His influence with the local Sherrif is decisivein terms of who is detained or not, as well.Next, this film projects a strong sentiment of isolation. It stemsfrom the very isolated community featured, but also from the""hazing"" (also seen in military bootcamps) felt by those who aredropped into small groups, with tremendous unknowns - at leastinitially. Lucas Black,  plays a youth who is released fromdetention, and assigned to rebuild his life after some time awayfrom freedom, thereby doubling the challenge at hand.Black's character is then given a valuable opportunity todemonstrate his work ethic, ability to learn, to take in stridevarious challenges, such as paying down a vehicle in return for hislabor in doing various handyman tasks (painting, cleaning,carpentry, driving and being Coyote's personal assistant, etc.)The compulsion to gamble is the least of concerns as an entire town(small shops, restaurants, and more) depends on the consumer usingup all their savings at the slot machines.Naturally, the youth tries his hand at deciphering how deep andsignificant are Maestro's flings with him, considering that he hasto deal with her official story of wanting out of her relationshipwith Coyote or her tasks as a hotel house keeper vs. doing whatCoyote's wanted her to do (have the flings?) or privately goingoutside of marriage with the mobster.The outcome of the story needs to be seen to be appreciated.Finally, the film is not wide-screen, and lacks subtitles. However,footage quality is valuable, notably the moments chosen in filmingthe action, the relaxed atmosphere, the hint at an egomanicalauthority being exerted by some individuals, of cliques, clans, andeveryone having to learn their role and limitations in that areaand managing those relationships, and the outdoor settings.",3,"A thriller, suspense story that needs to be seen to be appreciated",1252800000,"09 13, 2009",2009,2817,"['Deepwater', '2005', 'thriller', 'keeping', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'whenthe', 'story', 'well', 'underway', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'action', 'inbetween.The', 'study', 'human', 'rapport', 'environment', 'limitedinformation', 'mystery', 'where', 'frank', 'open', 'discussion', 'dayto', 'day', 'dealings', 'prohibited', 'core', 'also', 'coupled', 'witha', 'newcomer', 'various', 'parties', 'coming', 'up', 'bestguesses', 'underlying', 'motives', 'what', 'truely', 'happeningaround', 'Best', 'guess', 'key', 'phrase', 'here', 'building', 'thestory', 'keeping', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seats.Mia', 'Maestro', 'character', 'remarkable', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'hervisual', 'impact', 'natural', 'feel', 'rapport', 'built', 'presence', 'theother', 'characters', 'turning', 'real.Peter', 'Coyote', 'Finch', 'wonderful', 'job', 'veteran', 'mobsterwho', 'key', 'figure', 'underlying', 'operations', 'casino', 'anNative', 'reserve', 'collecting', 'illegal', 'debts', 'receiving', 'payoffs', 'loansharking', 'local', 'honest', 'businesses', 'skimming', 'profits', 'topbosses', 'more', 'influence', 'local', 'Sherrif', 'decisivein', 'terms', 'who', 'detained', 'not', 'well.Next', 'film', 'projects', 'strong', 'sentiment', 'isolation', 'stemsfrom', 'very', 'isolated', 'community', 'featured', 'also', 'hazing', 'also', 'seen', 'military', 'bootcamps', 'felt', 'who', 'aredropped', 'small', 'groups', 'tremendous', 'unknowns', 'leastinitially', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'youth', 'who', 'released', 'fromdetention', 'assigned', 'rebuild', 'life', 'time', 'awayfrom', 'freedom', 'thereby', 'doubling', 'challenge', 'hand.Black', 'character', 'then', 'given', 'valuable', 'opportunity', 'todemonstrate', 'work', 'ethic', 'ability', 'learn', 'take', 'stridevarious', 'challenges', 'such', 'paying', 'down', 'vehicle', 'return', 'hislabor', 'doing', 'various', 'handyman', 'tasks', 'painting', 'cleaning', 'carpentry', 'driving', 'being', 'Coyote', 'personal', 'assistant', 'etc', 'compulsion', 'gamble', 'least', 'concerns', 'entire', 'town', 'small', 'shops', 'restaurants', 'more', 'consumer', 'savings', 'slot', 'machines.Naturally', 'youth', 'hand', 'deciphering', 'how', 'deep', 'andsignificant', 'are', 'Maestro', 'flings', 'considering', 'hasto', 'deal', 'official', 'story', 'wanting', 'relationshipwith', 'Coyote', 'tasks', 'hotel', 'house', 'keeper', 'doing', 'whatCoyote', 'wanted', 'do', 'have', 'flings', 'privately', 'goingoutside', 'marriage', 'mobster.The', 'outcome', 'story', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'appreciated.Finally', 'film', 'not', 'wide-screen', 'subtitles', 'However', 'footage', 'quality', 'valuable', 'notably', 'moments', 'chosen', 'filmingthe', 'action', 'relaxed', 'atmosphere', 'hint', 'egomanicalauthority', 'being', 'exerted', 'individuals', 'cliques', 'clans', 'andeveryone', 'having', 'learn', 'role', 'limitations', 'areaand', 'managing', 'relationships', 'outdoor', 'settings']",Deepwater
992142,A387BD735MI50R,B000FKO5R4,R. Schultz,"[13, 14]","This movie will keep you on edge. All the characters are at least slightly tilt. All of them seem to have the potential to turn truly dangerous.Peter Coyote comes across as being the most likely one to tip this uneasy ensemble of characters into deep water. He assumes an unnaturally gravelly voice for this role. But he otherwise carves a convincing portrait as the owner of a flagging motel business. As he wheels and deals on the side as a ruthless loan shark and casino backer, you increasingly feel he is not someone you would want to cross. His need to maintain his position as Alpha Male despite his years - his penchant for perpetrating cruel practical jokes and the raucous glee he takes in their execution - all this makes him the kind of character we want to back away from.Then there's Mia Maestro as his much younger wife. She seems to have stepped out of a 1940s film noire. She's the kind of woman who was often named ""Lola"" in those films and who usually proved to be playing her own dangerous game with the detective as patsy.In this case, we fear the patsy might be Lucas Black`s character, a young man who's just been released limping from the hospital and who immediately gets himself embroiled as a handyman in the unwholesome dynamic at Coyote's motel. But we see that he too is veering into his own dangerous obsessions.This is a well-made, more-intelligent-than-average suspense drama. It kept me tautly balancing, like someone sitting in a small canoe in choppy waters. And it gave me a real feel for what it must be like to have a troubled psyche and to be looking at the world through broken glass.",4,Sinks You Into Risky Business,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,1625,"['movie', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'characters', 'are', 'least', 'slightly', 'tilt', 'seem', 'have', 'potential', 'turn', 'truly', 'dangerous.Peter', 'Coyote', 'across', 'being', 'most', 'likely', 'one', 'tip', 'uneasy', 'ensemble', 'characters', 'deep', 'water', 'unnaturally', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'role', 'otherwise', 'convincing', 'portrait', 'owner', 'flagging', 'motel', 'business', 'deals', 'side', 'ruthless', 'loan', 'shark', 'casino', 'backer', 'increasingly', 'feel', 'not', 'someone', 'would', 'want', 'cross', 'need', 'maintain', 'position', 'Alpha', 'Male', 'years', 'penchant', 'perpetrating', 'cruel', 'practical', 'jokes', 'raucous', 'glee', 'execution', 'kind', 'character', 'want', 'back', 'away', 'from.Then', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'much', 'younger', 'wife', 'have', 'stepped', '1940s', 'film', 'noire', 'kind', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'often', 'named', 'Lola', 'films', 'who', 'usually', 'proved', 'be', 'playing', 'own', 'dangerous', 'game', 'detective', 'patsy.In', 'case', 'fear', 'patsy', 'might', 'be', 'Lucas', 'Black', 's', 'character', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'limping', 'hospital', 'who', 'immediately', 'embroiled', 'handyman', 'unwholesome', 'dynamic', 'Coyote', 'motel', 'see', 'too', 'veering', 'own', 'dangerous', 'obsessions.This', 'well-made', 'more-intelligent-than-average', 'suspense', 'drama', 'kept', 'tautly', 'balancing', 'someone', 'sitting', 'small', 'canoe', 'choppy', 'waters', 'gave', 'real', 'feel', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'have', 'troubled', 'psyche', 'be', 'looking', 'world', 'broken', 'glass']",Deepwater
