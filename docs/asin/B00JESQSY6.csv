1696574,A25L1GQF65K55K,B00JESQSY6,Craig Haynes,"[0, 0]","That the early days of the discovery and spread of HIV/AIDS, was a very scary, bleak time indeed. Straights and especially gays were beside themselves with anxiety and fear and surrounded by misinformation, new information, new tests, new drugs, et al...it is very hard to believe that ANYONE survived all that. Moreover, history shows and continues to show that thousands did not and are not surviving--it isn't really over. The disease(s) and the virus that causes it, is still a palpable threat to the global community. This film brings all of that early climate of uncertainty to life again and is a reminder that HIV/AIDS lives. Although, I'm not sure the film adds much more than that. The actors are cute, talented and the direction is good. I like the pace of the film a lot and the attention to detail is rich indeed. I am a fan of modern and classical dance and so the context and backdrop for the film managed to enhance my appreciation for the sheer effort dancers exert and the physical pain they endure to make it all look so effortless, artful and beautiful. Was the fright of AIDS more of a threat and more anxious for those in the dance world in San Francisco than say the Hamburger Mary's in San Diego, maybe, but in the end the disease was and is no respecter of persons or place and as it turns out, of sexual orientation either. So that's why I have a mixed feeling about the added value of this story and why it needed to be told. The film 'Longtime Companion' is perhaps the benchmark of this genre of film and time period of the disease as well as the book and film chronicle 'And the Band Played On.'",3,How soon some forget....,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,1625,"['early', 'days', 'discovery', 'spread', 'HIV/AIDS', 'was', 'very', 'scary', 'bleak', 'time', 'indeed', 'Straights', 'especially', 'gays', 'were', 'beside', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'surrounded', 'misinformation', 'new', 'information', 'new', 'tests', 'new', 'drugs', 'et', 'al', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'ANYONE', 'survived', 'Moreover', 'history', 'shows', 'show', 'thousands', 'did', 'not', 'are', 'not', 'surviving', ""n't"", 'really', 'over', 'disease', 's', 'virus', 'still', 'palpable', 'threat', 'global', 'community', 'film', 'early', 'climate', 'uncertainty', 'life', 'again', 'reminder', 'HIV/AIDS', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'actors', 'are', 'cute', 'talented', 'direction', 'good', 'pace', 'film', 'lot', 'attention', 'detail', 'rich', 'indeed', 'am', 'fan', 'modern', 'classical', 'dance', 'so', 'context', 'backdrop', 'film', 'managed', 'enhance', 'appreciation', 'sheer', 'effort', 'dancers', 'exert', 'physical', 'pain', 'endure', 'make', 'look', 'so', 'effortless', 'artful', 'beautiful', 'Was', 'fright', 'AIDS', 'more', 'threat', 'more', 'anxious', 'dance', 'world', 'San', 'Francisco', 'say', 'Hamburger', 'Mary', 'San', 'Diego', 'maybe', 'end', 'disease', 'was', 'respecter', 'persons', 'place', 'out', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'why', 'have', 'mixed', 'feeling', 'added', 'value', 'story', 'why', 'needed', 'be', 'told', 'film', 'Companion', 'perhaps', 'benchmark', 'genre', 'film', 'time', 'period', 'disease', 'as', 'well', 'book', 'film', 'chronicle', 'Band', 'Played']",Test

""eblunt777""","[2, 2]","Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: Touted as ""Queer Cinema"", yes, Test is ""very gay,"" as expected, but an important semi-documentary style, talk with its community.Story goes...Frankie (Scott Marlowe) is a young dancer in San Francisco mid the 1980s. The openness he has been able to enjoy in this accepting city is about to change. Test takes us to the months during the start of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. The illness is everywhere, and no one yet, knows how or why it's happening. Anger, distrust, fear and ostracizing is raring its mob-mentality head.Frankie is scared. He checks his body frequently for tell-tale sores, he stops short before street posters of ""helpful"" AIDS alert/look for posters, and spray painted hate messages springing up on discarded mattresses directed towards gays.Frankie quietly, privately, reacts. With a new lover he tries to introduce a condom in the bedroom, ""They say we should use these antiquated things."" At work he falls in with a promiscuous mentor; but he stands confused.Test tells its story of one young man living in the middle of a sexual revolution that was banging on the door like a frothing drunk in a wife beater at 2 a.m. Who was sick, who wasn't. What causes this...there's a new test did you hear? They say it confidential. But, they'll surely expose you, and list your name somewhere. ""Hi mom and dad, I am gay and I am dying"". That one line may have you pausing the film to catch your breath.However, the acting wavers back and forth. Some words are delivered with a realism that hits the heart with its intended piercing effect Other whole scenes and sentences play out tinfoil-ish, and land with a emotionless thud.Thankfully, between the pendulum of acting chops and scraps, are remarkable dance sequences that seem to paradoxically tell these men's stories; the beauty they create in their dances each night, as an illness threatens those same graceful beings each day - off stage in reality. And, you can thank choreographer, Sidra Bell, and composer Ceiri Torjussen for these stunning modern dance (of the 80s style) interludes.Test is a reminder of why safe-sex is not just a phrase, but a way of life today for every sexual being. But, while this is a great film to watch with a new lover (gay readers) to help cement your safe-sex stand, Test is in no way a teaching moment for children or young adults. There is too much mental and physical adult content and its subject matter has no sugar coating applied: Test is talking frankly to an adult audience at all times.The men before you are all stunningly beautiful; cast-wise. This reviewer just wishes there was a tad more acting skill, and stronger edit choices, behind the brawn. Yet, to be perfectly blunt, if you enjoy dance, drama, and queer cinema, yes, this should be seen. It is not an easy watch emotionally. Test can be heartbreaking while visually stunning. You watch, all these years later, knowing what AIDS is and how it is spread, and what all these men (and women) are about to confront. You may have even lost many beloved friends to it. That thought is ever present as you view and hold your breath as the plot slowly reveals itself.",4,"Stunning, Strong Story but Acting Lacked",1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,3194,"['Emily', 'Blunt', 'over', 'BluntReview', 'dot', 'com', 'Touted', 'Queer', 'Cinema', 'yes', 'Test', 'very', 'gay', 'expected', 'important', 'semi-documentary', 'style', 'talk', 'community.Story', 'Frankie', 'Scott', 'Marlowe', 'young', 'dancer', 'San', 'Francisco', 'mid', '1980s', 'openness', 'been', 'able', 'enjoy', 'accepting', 'city', 'change', 'Test', 'months', 'start', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'United', 'States', 'illness', 'everywhere', 'one', 'yet', 'how', 'why', 'happening', 'Anger', 'distrust', 'fear', 'ostracizing', 'raring', 'mob-mentality', 'head.Frankie', 'scared', 'body', 'frequently', 'tell-tale', 'sores', 'short', 'street', 'posters', 'helpful', 'AIDS', 'alert/look', 'posters', 'spray', 'painted', 'hate', 'messages', 'springing', 'up', 'discarded', 'mattresses', 'directed', 'towards', 'gays.Frankie', 'quietly', 'privately', 'reacts', 'new', 'lover', 'introduce', 'condom', 'bedroom', 'say', 'should', 'use', 'antiquated', 'things', 'work', 'promiscuous', 'mentor', 'confused.Test', 'story', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'living', 'middle', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'was', 'banging', 'door', 'frothing', 'drunk', 'wife', 'beater', '2', 'a.m.', 'Who', 'was', 'sick', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'What', 'new', 'test', 'did', 'hear', 'say', 'confidential', ""'ll"", 'surely', 'expose', 'list', 'name', 'somewhere', 'Hi', 'mom', 'dad', 'am', 'gay', 'am', 'dying', 'one', 'line', 'may', 'have', 'pausing', 'film', 'catch', 'breath.However', 'acting', 'wavers', 'back', 'forth', 'words', 'are', 'delivered', 'realism', 'heart', 'intended', 'piercing', 'effect', 'Other', 'whole', 'scenes', 'sentences', 'play', 'out', 'tinfoil-ish', 'land', 'emotionless', 'thud.Thankfully', 'pendulum', 'acting', 'chops', 'scraps', 'are', 'remarkable', 'dance', 'sequences', 'seem', 'paradoxically', 'tell', 'men', 'stories', 'beauty', 'create', 'dances', 'night', 'illness', 'same', 'graceful', 'beings', 'day', 'off', 'stage', 'reality', 'can', 'thank', 'choreographer', 'Sidra', 'Bell', 'composer', 'Ceiri', 'Torjussen', 'stunning', 'modern', 'dance', '80s', 'style', 'interludes.Test', 'reminder', 'why', 'safe-sex', 'not', 'just', 'phrase', 'way', 'life', 'today', 'sexual', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'new', 'lover', 'gay', 'readers', 'help', 'cement', 'safe-sex', 'stand', 'Test', 'way', 'teaching', 'moment', 'children', 'young', 'adults', 'too', 'much', 'mental', 'physical', 'adult', 'content', 'subject', 'matter', 'sugar', 'coating', 'applied', 'Test', 'talking', 'frankly', 'adult', 'audience', 'times.The', 'men', 'are', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'cast-wise', 'reviewer', 'just', 'wishes', 'there', 'was', 'tad', 'more', 'acting', 'skill', 'stronger', 'edit', 'choices', 'brawn', 'be', 'perfectly', 'blunt', 'enjoy', 'dance', 'drama', 'queer', 'cinema', 'yes', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'emotionally', 'Test', 'can', 'be', 'heartbreaking', 'visually', 'stunning', 'watch', 'years', 'later', 'knowing', 'what', 'AIDS', 'how', 'spread', 'what', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'confront', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'lost', 'many', 'beloved', 'friends', 'thought', 'ever', 'present', 'view', 'hold', 'breath', 'plot', 'slowly']",Test

1696578,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B00JESQSY6,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[5, 6]","This film was a long time a-coming, especially due to the need to raise funds for its production; that cannot have been an easy matter, for this is both dance and cinema, each of which has its respective expenses to cover. Anyway, the result is a triumph. This is one of Wolfe's videos or films that really works as cinema, not ""feeling"" like slightly glorified television. ""The Test"" (Wolfe WOL-5203-D) is an intimate film, to be sure, but it is not cramped and airless in the manner of so much TV.The choreography (by the illustrious Sidra Bell, if I read the credits aright), which the dancers of the film's small San Francisco modern dance company are seen rehearsing and performing at various times during its preparation and theatrical run, is superb, resulting in a showcase that displays really fine modern dance choreography and dancing at their best. Some of the dancers are better than others, but all function at a satisfyingly professional level or at more than that. The work danced is brief but very absorbing, feeling neither too short nor too extended, eminently well suited to its place in the movie. Most of the dancers are male, and it is they who hold the stage and the viewer's attention for most of the work, but there are some women among them, too.There are no real costumes, as such, for the cast. (If the location were 21st century Montr&eacute;al, instead of 1980s San Francisco, the dancers probably would appear nude in such an abstract work.) The lighting suffices for background and foreground, illuminating men with good-looking bodies, some of whom, like the main character, Frankie (Scott Marlowe's role), are exceptionally handsome, Marlowe himself being so in a leanly muscled, lithe, boyish way, having a dancer's ideal physique, if there can be said to be such. They dance shirtless and in full length, snugly-fitting pants (rather than in skin-tight leotards). Moments of the choreography, as depicted in rehearsal and in various performances, interweave throughout the movie, while a bonus feature presents, very welcomely, the entire choreography uninterrupted.Frankie, Scott Marlowe's role, is an understudy who triumphs when it comes time for him to appear in the dance production. That is one sense in which he passes a professional ""test"". What gives ""The Test"" its title, however, are the HIV tests which he and two other of the film's characters take. The two dancers among them, after tense waiting, learn that they are ""HIV negative"". Alas, one of the men (the one of the three who is not a professional dancer), with whom Frankie already has fornicated homosexually, finds out that he has tested negative, only adding, of course, to the main character's edginess. While there is tension surrounding the condition, at a time (1985) where there still was so much uncertainty regarding so much of what HIV-AIDS is and what causes it (not even mention to mention the lack of a cure, or, for that matter, even of palliative prescription treatment at that time), this film, for a refreshing change, does not go into high weeping gear or quasi-tragic antics in the face of all of that, as so many other gay films do so! Thus, Marlowe's character passes the test regarding health as successfully as he fares in his feat of professional attainment.This film is a triumph over all the adversities and obstacles that there had been to finance and to film it. I had waited impatiently for its appearance, now in 2014, and the project is a complete success!",5,"""The Test"" Is an Unusually Good Gay Indie Film of Its Own or Any Other Kind, with Excellent Dancing and Acting",1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,3495,"['film', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'a-coming', 'especially', 'due', 'need', 'raise', 'funds', 'production', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'matter', 'dance', 'cinema', 'respective', 'expenses', 'cover', 'Anyway', 'result', 'triumph', 'one', 'Wolfe', 'videos', 'films', 'really', 'cinema', 'not', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'glorified', 'television', 'Test', 'Wolfe', 'WOL-5203-D', 'intimate', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'cramped', 'airless', 'manner', 'so', 'much', 'TV.The', 'choreography', 'illustrious', 'Sidra', 'Bell', 'read', 'credits', 'aright', 'dancers', 'film', 'small', 'San', 'Francisco', 'modern', 'dance', 'company', 'are', 'seen', 'rehearsing', 'performing', 'various', 'times', 'preparation', 'theatrical', 'run', 'superb', 'resulting', 'showcase', 'really', 'fine', 'modern', 'dance', 'choreography', 'dancing', 'best', 'dancers', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'function', 'satisfyingly', 'professional', 'level', 'more', 'work', 'danced', 'brief', 'very', 'absorbing', 'feeling', 'neither', 'too', 'short', 'too', 'extended', 'eminently', 'well', 'suited', 'place', 'movie', 'Most', 'dancers', 'are', 'male', 'who', 'hold', 'stage', 'viewer', 'attention', 'most', 'work', 'are', 'women', 'are', 'real', 'costumes', 'such', 'cast', 'location', 'were', '21st', 'century', 'Montr', 'eacute', 'instead', '1980s', 'San', 'Francisco', 'dancers', 'probably', 'would', 'appear', 'nude', 'such', 'abstract', 'work', 'lighting', 'suffices', 'background', 'foreground', 'illuminating', 'men', 'good-looking', 'bodies', 'whom', 'main', 'character', 'Frankie', 'Scott', 'Marlowe', 'role', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'handsome', 'Marlowe', 'being', 'so', 'leanly', 'muscled', 'lithe', 'boyish', 'way', 'having', 'dancer', 'ideal', 'physique', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'such', 'dance', 'shirtless', 'full', 'length', 'snugly-fitting', 'pants', 'rather', 'skin-tight', 'leotards', 'Moments', 'choreography', 'depicted', 'rehearsal', 'various', 'performances', 'interweave', 'movie', 'bonus', 'feature', 'presents', 'very', 'welcomely', 'entire', 'choreography', 'uninterrupted.Frankie', 'Scott', 'Marlowe', 'role', 'understudy', 'who', 'when', 'time', 'appear', 'dance', 'production', 'one', 'sense', 'professional', 'test', 'What', 'Test', 'title', 'however', 'are', 'HIV', 'tests', 'two', 'other', 'film', 'characters', 'take', 'two', 'dancers', 'tense', 'waiting', 'learn', 'are', 'HIV', 'negative', 'Alas', 'one', 'men', 'one', 'three', 'who', 'not', 'professional', 'dancer', 'whom', 'Frankie', 'already', 'fornicated', 'homosexually', 'out', 'tested', 'negative', 'only', 'adding', 'course', 'main', 'character', 'edginess', 'tension', 'surrounding', 'condition', 'time', '1985', 'where', 'still', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'uncertainty', 'regarding', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'HIV-AIDS', 'what', 'not', 'even', 'mention', 'mention', 'lack', 'cure', 'matter', 'even', 'palliative', 'prescription', 'treatment', 'time', 'film', 'refreshing', 'change', 'not', 'go', 'high', 'weeping', 'gear', 'quasi-tragic', 'antics', 'face', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'gay', 'films', 'do', 'so', 'Thus', 'Marlowe', 'character', 'test', 'regarding', 'health', 'as', 'successfully', 'feat', 'professional', 'attainment.This', 'film', 'triumph', 'adversities', 'obstacles', 'had', 'been', 'finance', 'film', 'had', 'waited', 'impatiently', 'appearance', 'now', '2014', 'project', 'complete', 'success']",Test

Had I been a little younger and actually good at sex, I may have had a harder time with it.  So many kids, especially in San Francisco were living in fear as so little was being done, and people were shunning them because we knew so little.

The lead character asks at the end (while in bed with another man) ""I wonder if this will lead to an outbreak of monogamy?  Seems so unnatural.""  Same old tired party-line.
