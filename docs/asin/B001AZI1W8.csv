1169178,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001AZI1W8,Armando N. Roman,"[6, 8]","The minute I saw that there was a concert performance of Rihanna's on dvd/blu-ray, I ordered it. I was a bit worried before watching it though, after seeing the track list- it doesn't have all of my favorites, and it has two songs of hers that I don't care for. But you know what? The rad-ness of this concert shot down all my worries, because what's not here doesn't matter, and what I don't like is now likable thanks to this concert. Here's the track list:Introduction, Pon De Replay, Break It Off, Let Me, Rehab, Breakin' Dishes, Is This Love (Bob Marley cover), Kisses Don't Lie, Scratch, SOS, Good Girl Gone Bad, Hate That I Love You, Unfaithful, Sell Me Candy, DJ Kevmo/Don't Stop the Music, Push up on Me, Shut Up and Drive, Question Existing, UmbrellaI'll tell you right now- the majority of the tracks on here are given a rock/metal sound. The hip hop's still there, but the main focus is on electric guitar riffs and chords, and to tell you the truth, I really dig it. As much as I love the original tracks from her albums, the guitar gives them a fresh sound, and it's like you're hearing them for the first time all over again. Another surprise that shocked me was that Rihanna actually -sang- her songs rather than her half-talk half-sing that she usually does. It was great hearing her belt out some of the lyrics, and having some emotion and energy while moving around on stage. The girl can dance, and she keeps up with her dancers perfectly. There's really nothing bad I can say at all regarding the performance. Camera cuts didn't bother me for a change because they always go to a good angle, or focus on the band, or some of the pyro and special effects. This is a hell of a concert, and I can only imagine being there to see it live. The crowd is absolutely nuts, and you can't blame them.Since I don't usually buy concert performances, I don't know what more there is to say. Fans of Rihanna will most likely enjoy the show, but I know some people were turned off by the guitar-driven music. My only complaint is a small one, and it has nothing to do with Rihanna, but with how many cuts there are to the crowd. It's good to show the crowd enjoying themselves, but there are A LOT of crowd shots, to the point where I was wishing they'd cut half of it so we could get more footage of Rihanna and the band. Especially when she does her wardrobe change into the classy dress that shows off those Chun-Li legs of hers. Good god, I stopped eating and my jaw dropped as soon as she walked out in that lil' number...The video and audio quality of the blu-ray are flawless. If you have a 1080p/i tv, THIS is the music blu-ray to show it off with. Everything is sharp, and you could probably count every single spark from the stage effects if you wanted to. And if you've got a nice audio setup, again, this will give your speakers a nice workout. Heck, maybe you should get a home theater system just for this!The special features are sparse though- there's just a short documentary about Rihanna going on tour with short interviews with her friends and crew. It's nothing special, but she explains why she performs one of her songs, and they also go into how Rihanna's a prankster, and it's better for her buddies to not mess with her. Watch your shoes if you play a prank on Rihanna.While I would've liked her to sing Disturbia and a few other songs, I'm very happy with what's here, and hope that Rihanna puts out another performance like this on blu-ray soon. If you're a big fan of the queen of pop, buy this right now!",5,"Yes, please don't stop the music!",1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,3540,"['minute', 'saw', 'was', 'concert', 'performance', 'Rihanna', 'dvd/blu-ray', 'ordered', 'was', 'bit', 'worried', 'watching', 'seeing', 'track', 'list-', ""n't"", 'have', 'favorites', 'two', 'songs', 'hers', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'know', 'what', 'rad-ness', 'concert', 'shot', 'down', 'worries', 'what', 'not', 'here', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'now', 'likable', 'thanks', 'concert', 'Here', 'track', 'list', 'Introduction', 'Pon', 'De', 'Replay', 'Break', 'Off', 'Let', 'Me', 'Rehab', 'Breakin', 'Dishes', 'Love', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'cover', 'Kisses', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Lie', 'Scratch', 'SOS', 'Good', 'Girl', 'Gone', 'Bad', 'Hate', 'Love', 'Unfaithful', 'Sell', 'Me', 'Candy', 'DJ', 'Kevmo/Do', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Music', 'Push', 'up', 'Me', 'Shut', 'Up', 'Drive', 'Question', 'Existing', 'UmbrellaI', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'right', 'now-', 'majority', 'tracks', 'here', 'are', 'given', 'rock/metal', 'sound', 'hip', 'hop', 'still', 'there', 'main', 'focus', 'electric', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'chords', 'tell', 'truth', 'really', 'dig', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'original', 'tracks', 'albums', 'guitar', 'fresh', 'sound', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'first', 'time', 'over', 'again', 'surprise', 'shocked', 'was', 'Rihanna', 'actually', 'songs', 'rather', 'half-talk', 'half-sing', 'usually', 'was', 'great', 'hearing', 'belt', 'lyrics', 'having', 'emotion', 'energy', 'moving', 'around', 'stage', 'girl', 'can', 'dance', 'up', 'dancers', 'perfectly', 'really', 'nothing', 'bad', 'can', 'say', 'regarding', 'performance', 'Camera', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'change', 'always', 'go', 'good', 'angle', 'focus', 'band', 'pyro', 'special', 'effects', 'hell', 'concert', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'being', 'there', 'see', 'live', 'crowd', 'absolutely', 'nuts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'them.Since', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'buy', 'concert', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'more', 'say', 'Fans', 'Rihanna', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'show', 'know', 'people', 'were', 'turned', 'off', 'guitar-driven', 'music', 'only', 'complaint', 'small', 'one', 'nothing', 'do', 'Rihanna', 'how', 'many', 'cuts', 'are', 'crowd', 'good', 'show', 'crowd', 'enjoying', 'are', 'LOT', 'crowd', 'shots', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'cut', 'half', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'footage', 'Rihanna', 'band', 'Especially', 'when', 'wardrobe', 'change', 'classy', 'dress', 'Chun-Li', 'legs', 'hers', 'Good', 'god', 'stopped', 'eating', 'jaw', 'dropped', 'as', 'soon', 'walked', 'out', 'lil', 'number', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'blu-ray', 'are', 'flawless', 'have', '1080p/i', 'tv', 'THIS', 'music', 'blu-ray', 'show', 'off', 'Everything', 'sharp', 'could', 'probably', 'count', 'single', 'spark', 'stage', 'effects', 'wanted', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nice', 'audio', 'setup', 'again', 'will', 'give', 'speakers', 'nice', 'workout', 'Heck', 'maybe', 'should', 'get', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'just', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'sparse', 'though-', 'just', 'short', 'documentary', 'Rihanna', 'going', 'tour', 'short', 'interviews', 'friends', 'crew', 'nothing', 'special', 'why', 'one', 'songs', 'also', 'go', 'how', 'Rihanna', 'prankster', 'better', 'buddies', 'not', 'mess', 'Watch', 'shoes', 'play', 'prank', 'Rihanna.While', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'sing', 'Disturbia', 'few', 'other', 'songs', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'what', 'here', 'hope', 'Rihanna', 'out', 'performance', 'blu-ray', 'soon', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'queen', 'pop', 'buy', 'right', 'now']",N/A

But her performance on this blu-ray was great. Rihanna really knows how to put on a show. IMHO, I think she's the only entertainer that can pull off her hair style and those outfits. The behind the scenes part but short but loved to see how things were put together for the concert. Rihanna's accent is great. Fell in love with her all over again.Overall, like I said, the disc was decent. If you enjoy Rihanna's music this would be a blu-ray to buy. Plus it's not that expensive.

1169181,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B001AZI1W8,Irfan A. Alvi,"[1, 1]","My musical taste tends more in the direction of jazz-rock fusion, though I like all sorts of music, including some pop music.  Among pop artists, I would say that Rihanna has emerged as one of my favorites.  Whereas some pop artists have a rather formulaic and gimmicky approach which tells you they're not going to be around for long, Rihanna has genuine musicality.  Her songs are well crafted and fairly diverse, covering the spectrum from rock to carribean party vibes to heartfelt ballads, and her singing is surprisingly good, with phrasing which often reminds me of guitar playing (though, as a guitarist myself, perhaps I'm predisposed to hear that).This concert DVD brings out all of these qualities.  Again, the songs and Rihanna's singing are generally excellent.  On top of that, her band sounds great too, and the overall sound quality of the DVD is excellent.  As far as the non-musical aspects of the show, they aren't quite as stellar as the music, but still acceptable.  For example, her four dancers have a relatively minor role, and Rihanna herself doesn't do much serious dancing.  Likewise, the wardrobes and stage lighting get the job done, but they're not as theatrically powerful as some other concerts I've seen.But music comes first so, all things considered, I think this is an excellent concert performance, and I especially recommend it to fans of Rihanna.",5,Excellent,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,1385,"['musical', 'taste', 'more', 'direction', 'jazz-rock', 'fusion', 'like', 'sorts', 'music', 'including', 'pop', 'music', 'pop', 'artists', 'would', 'say', 'Rihanna', 'emerged', 'one', 'favorites', 'Whereas', 'pop', 'artists', 'have', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'gimmicky', 'approach', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'long', 'Rihanna', 'genuine', 'musicality', 'songs', 'are', 'well', 'crafted', 'fairly', 'diverse', 'covering', 'spectrum', 'rock', 'carribean', 'party', 'vibes', 'heartfelt', 'ballads', 'singing', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'phrasing', 'often', 'guitar', 'playing', 'though', 'guitarist', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'predisposed', 'hear', '.This', 'concert', 'DVD', 'out', 'qualities', 'Again', 'songs', 'Rihanna', 'singing', 'are', 'generally', 'excellent', 'top', 'band', 'great', 'too', 'overall', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'As', 'far', 'non-musical', 'aspects', 'show', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'stellar', 'music', 'still', 'acceptable', 'example', 'four', 'dancers', 'have', 'relatively', 'minor', 'role', 'Rihanna', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'serious', 'dancing', 'Likewise', 'wardrobes', 'stage', 'lighting', 'get', 'job', 'done', ""'re"", 'not', 'theatrically', 'powerful', 'other', 'concerts', ""'ve"", 'seen.But', 'music', 'first', 'so', 'things', 'considered', 'think', 'excellent', 'concert', 'performance', 'especially', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Rihanna']",N/A

Some hate her voice, I say she is unique, she is Rihanna and for that she gets 5 stars. The Good Girl Gone Bad album is undoubtably her best, my first Rihanna CD I bought and did not regret, the videos left on me a great impression, I mean who can forget the amazing ""Umbrella"" video with her painted in metalic silver (I wonder if she borrowed the idea from Madonna's ""Fever Video""), great dance sequence, her body is hot, amazing. ""Shut up and Drive"" another great video Rihanna looks hotter than hot, I can go on and on. I am however not impressed with all the other releases of this album ""Reloaded"" and ""Remixed"" they are really milking it for what its worth.Anyway getting back to the subject at hand the ""Good Girl Gone Bad"" live DVD. I guess I expected too much, I expected to see her dance like she does in her videos but she rarely does, she also seems to have put on a little (and I'm just being nice) weight on the hips, I was looking forward to see the hot bodied Rihanna from the Videos, it was not elaborate enough as I wanted it to be for such a successful album. She does however sing all her hits from this amazing album including a few from her previous album including the massive UK #1 hit ""SOS"", the sound quality is great as well and the behind the scenes are pretty cool to look at, you see her in a different light, she seems like a really down to earth lady and she will always be gorgeous.
