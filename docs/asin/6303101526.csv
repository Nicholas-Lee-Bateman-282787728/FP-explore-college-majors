WHEN YOU SEE THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE, especially on large screen TVs, IT REALLY HURTS THAT YOU PAID SO MUCH FOR IT.With so many good series to watch, the ordeal of an eye-stain is just not worth it.  I felt the people who released this dvd took their customers for granted.  This review is about the quality of the picture, not the actual content itself, which is excellent.Watching this on a small screen 14 inch TV helps to reduce eye-strain.  There are no sub-titles.  As this genre of movies tend to be watched when the brats are asleep, sub-titles help in allowing the volume to be kept down.We know this stuff is dated.  Nobody is expecting the picture quality of Gosford Park or Pride and Prejudice.  But save this purchase until you have seen the rest.  Test your eyesight tolerance with Sorrell and Son.  Sorrell and Son will of course get the 5 star reviews.If you have the stomach for the picture quality of Sorrel and Son, you still have some way to go before you can cope with the picture quality of the Flambards.Be warned.  People who buy this sort of dvd usually do not have the time or want to put up with the hassle of returning them.November 2009 update:  Cranford in Blu-ray is only $28.  Bleak House Blu-ray is $34.  Little Dorrit dvd set is $31.  And they all have subtitles.  Even the English I know do not speak like this any more, so the subtitles are helpful.  All the recent BBC productions are visual delights with impeccable visual images.

356180,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,6303101526,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[4, 7]","If they had not been written at a later date, to me, the K.M. Peyton novels ""The Flambards"" could have been a part of what inspired Stella Gibbon in 1932 to write her brilliant and very humorous spoof, ""Cold Comfort Farm"" which is also about an orphaned girl going to live with some very strange (skuzzy) relatives on a decrepit farm. The heroine of that story eventually restores the farm through her own aggressiveness and resilience.  This DVD of the BBC's 1978 adaptation of ""The Flambards"" is no spoof; however, it is a serious tale about an orphaned girl that has exhausted her welcome at her aunts' homes and has come to stay with her very surly, bitter and crippled uncle and his two rather strange sons--one being nasty and a very unkind snob loving to hunt and ride horses and the other being misunderstood but very nice and not a snob hating to hunt and ride horses but loving airplanes.  The reason that she is even welcomed in the uncle's home is that when she ""comes of age"" she has an inheritance which makes her very desirable as a daughter-in-law.  Plus once she becomes a ""woman of means"", she can restore the crumbling Flambards farm.Although the acting is good and the series gets better as it goes along, I basically found the whole enterprise to be rather dated with the picture quality of the DVD being rather fuzzy especially in the first two episodes and the sound quality being very poor through out all of the episodes--I could not understand the dialog over the irritating background music plus, (I'm afraid, to me),  the entire series has one of the worse sound tracts that I've ever heard--it almost drove me to drink (not that I need any excuse)--(I really did not understand the use of the word""mum"" over and over in the recurring theme music; it was as if the singers had run out of words to sing and were just making incoherent vocal sounds to the music;after the ""mums"" stop then there is some infernal whistling .  All that I do know it annoyed me immensely.)I had not seen this program previously; therefore, this was my first exposure to the Flambards.  Therefore, I have no great nostalgia for this program which no doubt affected my opinion of this presentation.Needless, to say, I was disappointed with this DVD of ""The Flambards""",3,"COULD HAVE BEEN INSPIRATION FOR ""COLD COMFORT FARM""",1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,2271,"['had', 'not', 'been', 'written', 'later', 'date', 'K.M', 'Peyton', 'Flambards', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'what', 'inspired', 'Stella', 'Gibbon', '1932', 'write', 'brilliant', 'very', 'humorous', 'spoof', 'Cold', 'Comfort', 'Farm', 'also', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'going', 'live', 'very', 'strange', 'skuzzy', 'decrepit', 'farm', 'heroine', 'story', 'eventually', 'farm', 'own', 'aggressiveness', 'resilience', 'DVD', 'BBC', '1978', 'adaptation', 'Flambards', 'spoof', 'however', 'serious', 'tale', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'exhausted', 'welcome', 'aunts', 'homes', 'come', 'stay', 'very', 'surly', 'bitter', 'crippled', 'uncle', 'two', 'rather', 'strange', 'sons', 'one', 'being', 'nasty', 'very', 'unkind', 'snob', 'loving', 'hunt', 'ride', 'horses', 'other', 'being', 'misunderstood', 'very', 'nice', 'not', 'snob', 'hating', 'hunt', 'ride', 'horses', 'loving', 'airplanes', 'reason', 'even', 'welcomed', 'uncle', 'home', 'when', 'age', 'inheritance', 'very', 'desirable', 'daughter-in-law', 'once', 'woman', 'means', 'can', 'restore', 'crumbling', 'Flambards', 'acting', 'good', 'series', 'better', 'along', 'basically', 'found', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'be', 'rather', 'dated', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'being', 'rather', 'fuzzy', 'especially', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'sound', 'quality', 'being', 'very', 'poor', 'episodes', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'dialog', 'irritating', 'background', 'music', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'worse', 'sound', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'almost', 'drove', 'drink', 'not', 'need', 'excuse', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'use', 'word', 'mum', 'recurring', 'theme', 'music', 'was', 'singers', 'had', 'run', 'words', 'sing', 'were', 'just', 'making', 'incoherent', 'vocal', 'sounds', 'music', 'mums', 'stop', 'then', 'infernal', 'whistling', 'do', 'know', 'immensely', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'program', 'previously', 'therefore', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'Flambards', 'Therefore', 'have', 'great', 'nostalgia', 'program', 'doubt', 'affected', 'opinion', 'presentation.Needless', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'Flambards']",Flambards Collection Set VHS

The costuming and the interiors/exteriors are top-notch but that silly music that the other reviewers mention is indeed annoying and is so irrelevant to the storyline. I was not watching PBS and British dramas in the late 70's so I am not familiar with any of the actors who star in the series. I am surprised it has not been re-made since it has alot of potential with the right cast and a better soundtrack. I am on disc three, so I am anxious to see how it wraps up. The music really ruins this in my opinion since it sounds too contemporary for the time period.

Each subsequent viewing was as wonderful as the first.

This is a beautifully-filmed series that is unfortunately not really showcased by the DVD transfer, but it doesn't matter, it is Flambards complete and unedited (unlike the 1980 PBS broadcast that combined parts 1 & 2 into a single hour-long episodes and A&E's ""chopped-to-flinders-for-commericals"" version). Actors Edward Judd (as the choleric Uncle Russell), Alan Parnaby as Will, Steven Grives as Mark, Peter Settelen as Will's fellow-flyer Sandy, and Carol Leader as the unconventional Dorothy are also outstanding. And there is David Fanshawe's memorable soundtrack as well, with haunting themes, sprightly interstices, and the nostalgic ""Song of Christina"" ballad.

There's a great, forward sweeping movement to each episode, an Edwardian country grandeur that's irresistible.

Almost all US television shows and movies are filmed using 35mm, which contains roughly 4 times the detail of 16mm. Also the 16mm film stock they were using at the time often wasn't that great. This wasn't very noticeable on the TVs then. What this means is that these DVDs may have the best picture that will ever be available.",4,"Lucky to have it at all, but the video-transfer is terrible",1056412800,"06 24, 2003",2003,953,"['am', 'extremely', 'grateful', 'wonderful', 'series', 'even', 'available', 'DVD', 'Most', 'unfortunately', 'company', 'created', 'DVD', 'did', 'terrible', 'job', 'video', 'quality', 'just', 'awful', 'created', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'Most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'and/or', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'watching', 'high-quality', 'monitor', 'will', 'find', 'sometimes', 'distracting', 'annoying', 'really', 'shame', 'Perhaps', 'sometime', 'future', ""'ll"", 'have', 'new', 'hi-def', 'version', 'master', 'film', 'negative.Update', 'wrote', 'learned', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'British', 'TV', 'programs', 'were', 'filmed', 'using', '16mm', 'cameras', 'cut', 'production', 'costs', 'Almost', 'US', 'television', 'shows', 'movies', 'are', 'filmed', 'using', '35mm', 'roughly', '4', 'times', 'detail', '16mm', 'Also', '16mm', 'film', 'stock', 'were', 'using', 'time', 'often', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'noticeable', 'TVs', 'then', 'What', 'DVDs', 'may', 'have', 'best', 'picture', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'available']",Flambards Collection Set VHS
356193,ANEDXRFDZDL18,6303101526,Serene Night,"[11, 20]","Flambards is the visually appealing, and compelling drama of a young girl, sent to live with her evil old uncle and cousins William and Mark. In the tradition of ""Heidi,"" Christina soon becomes assimilated into the Flambards way of life, becoming the eventual romantic wishbone between Mark and William.I have never previously viewed Flambards, so I was completely blown away by the spectacular story, and fantastic acting. I LOVED Christina, her romance with William, and felt sad for Violet and the stableman Dick. My only problem with Flambards at all was the SOUNDTRACK. There is some awful 'seventies' style disco music which has people actually singing: ""Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom"" and whistling cheerily throughout. This was... Well, quite frankly awful, and did not suit such a well-done period piece.Plotwise: I also felt William was a bit too obsessed with planes. Everything was about 'him' and his desire to achieve HIS dream. When it came to Christina and HER interests he scoffed and picked at her love of horses. Christina, of course was VERY tolerant, loving and considerate. I wonder if William would be so tolerant if it was HIS interests were the ones being constantly ridiculedOverall, a great series the entire family will enjoy.",5,Excellent!,1055203200,"06 10, 2003",2003,1243,"['Flambards', 'visually', 'appealing', 'compelling', 'drama', 'young', 'girl', 'sent', 'live', 'evil', 'old', 'uncle', 'cousins', 'William', 'Mark', 'tradition', 'Heidi', 'Christina', 'soon', 'becomes', 'assimilated', 'Flambards', 'way', 'life', 'becoming', 'eventual', 'romantic', 'wishbone', 'Mark', 'William.I', 'have', 'never', 'previously', 'viewed', 'Flambards', 'was', 'completely', 'blown', 'away', 'spectacular', 'story', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'LOVED', 'Christina', 'romance', 'William', 'felt', 'sad', 'Violet', 'stableman', 'Dick', 'only', 'problem', 'Flambards', 'was', 'SOUNDTRACK', 'awful', ""'seventies"", 'style', 'disco', 'music', 'people', 'actually', 'singing', 'Bom', 'Bom', 'Bom', 'Bom', 'whistling', 'cheerily', 'was', 'Well', 'quite', 'frankly', 'awful', 'did', 'not', 'suit', 'such', 'well-done', 'period', 'piece.Plotwise', 'also', 'felt', 'William', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'obsessed', 'planes', 'Everything', 'was', ""'him"", 'desire', 'achieve', 'HIS', 'dream', 'When', 'came', 'Christina', 'HER', 'interests', 'scoffed', 'picked', 'love', 'horses', 'Christina', 'course', 'was', 'VERY', 'tolerant', 'loving', 'considerate', 'wonder', 'William', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'tolerant', 'was', 'HIS', 'interests', 'were', 'ones', 'being', 'constantly', 'ridiculedOverall', 'great', 'series', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy']",Flambards Collection Set VHS
356194,A13STKDYQO5DQ8,6303101526,"S. Hebbron ""S B H.""","[10, 10]","I adored this series when it first aired in 1978, I was 12 at the time and staying at my Gran's during the summer it was first aired in England. It became a ritual for us both to watch the show without interuption. We would work hard in the lead up to Friday evenings, do the housework, prepare and eat the evening meal, wash up, have baths and settle to watch Flambards with a bag of fruit bonbons to share.The story was a wonderful encapsualation of dominant themes from the early 20th century, aviation, the decline of the gentry, emerging war in Europe and the rise of the rights of Women. All these issues are deliciously brought to life in the life of the characters but particularly through Christina, William and Christina's friend Dorothy. It was a delightful show which signalled the importance of 1900's and 1910's for a new generation (it was news even to my Gran who was born in 1926) and it displayed the valor of the human spirit shining through diversity. Important, overlooked, historically educational, emotive nad beautiful. I have special memories of this series as it now signals times past for me, my Gran died in 1990 and life is not as it was in 1978, now. For me this signals the increased value of Flambards and stories like it, for not only are they highly dramatic and engaging stories but they are perfectly clear windows into forgotten and unknown portions of history.",5,A lovely depiction of the novel.,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,1398,"['adored', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'aired', '1978', 'was', '12', 'time', 'staying', 'Gran', 'summer', 'was', 'first', 'aired', 'England', 'became', 'ritual', 'watch', 'show', 'interuption', 'would', 'work', 'hard', 'lead', 'Friday', 'evenings', 'do', 'housework', 'prepare', 'eat', 'evening', 'meal', 'wash', 'up', 'have', 'baths', 'settle', 'watch', 'Flambards', 'bag', 'fruit', 'bonbons', 'share.The', 'story', 'was', 'wonderful', 'encapsualation', 'dominant', 'themes', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'aviation', 'decline', 'gentry', 'emerging', 'war', 'Europe', 'rise', 'rights', 'Women', 'issues', 'are', 'deliciously', 'brought', 'life', 'life', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Christina', 'William', 'Christina', 'friend', 'Dorothy', 'was', 'delightful', 'show', 'signalled', 'importance', '1900', '1910', 'new', 'generation', 'was', 'news', 'even', 'Gran', 'who', 'was', 'born', '1926', 'displayed', 'valor', 'human', 'spirit', 'shining', 'diversity', 'Important', 'overlooked', 'historically', 'educational', 'emotive', 'nad', 'beautiful', 'have', 'special', 'memories', 'series', 'now', 'times', 'Gran', 'died', '1990', 'life', 'not', 'was', '1978', 'now', 'increased', 'value', 'Flambards', 'stories', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'highly', 'dramatic', 'engaging', 'stories', 'are', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'windows', 'forgotten', 'unknown', 'portions', 'history']",Flambards Collection Set VHS
