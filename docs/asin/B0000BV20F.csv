770886,A91BK8S5QH98K,B0000BV20F,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[2, 3]","This movie features Charles Dickens wandering the streets at night.  The pressures of having to make a living and escaping his childhood poverty haunt him.  And on one night two men try to rob him.  A young girl rescues him and he follows her out of both curiosity and gratitude.  He sees that she is working in one of the notorious child labor factories of the industrial revolution.  Suffering from writer's cramp, he wanders the streets a few days later and this time he is able to rescue the girl from would be robbers.  However, the girl escapes before he is able to return her money to her and it leaves Dickens with the concern of wanting to return her money to her some day.  As the movie unfolds we realize that the little girl becomes his inspiration for the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future which forms the basis of his book ""A Christmas Carol.""  The actor portraying Dickens is believable.  And the movie as a whole is quite well done.  The little girl sometimes sounds more American than British, but the storyline is captivating.  And it will make you appreciate the writing of Charles Dickens even more.  It is a clean movie and appropriate for family viewing.",5,Very Interesting.,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,1188,"['movie', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'wandering', 'streets', 'night', 'pressures', 'having', 'make', 'living', 'escaping', 'childhood', 'poverty', 'haunt', 'one', 'night', 'two', 'men', 'try', 'rob', 'young', 'girl', 'curiosity', 'gratitude', 'working', 'one', 'notorious', 'child', 'labor', 'factories', 'industrial', 'revolution', 'Suffering', 'writer', 'cramp', 'streets', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'time', 'able', 'rescue', 'girl', 'would', 'be', 'robbers', 'However', 'girl', 'able', 'return', 'money', 'concern', 'wanting', 'return', 'money', 'day', 'movie', 'realize', 'little', 'girl', 'inspiration', 'Ghosts', 'Christmas', 'Past', 'Present', 'Future', 'basis', 'book', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Dickens', 'believable', 'movie', 'whole', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'little', 'girl', 'sometimes', 'more', 'American', 'British', 'storyline', 'captivating', 'will', 'make', 'appreciate', 'writing', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'even', 'more', 'clean', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'family', 'viewing']",N/A

The Studio is dedicated to family films that strengthen traditional family values through entertainment. This tape even has a Parent's Guide printed on the back with topics for family discussion. Just superlative all around!Now for the story: Getting beyond our own needs,"" a close friend tells Charles Dickens, ""takes thought and effort and, above all, an unselfish heart."" The timely advice is given as the author struggles to write - only for profit. Unfortunately, his desire for financial security only fuels his own fears and self-pity. When his soul-searching leads him into peril, he receives unexpected help from a young girl. Hauntingly, her life mirrors his own childhood. Though the strange events she reveals to Dickens, she reawakens in him a desire to refocus his priorities. But he runs into a wall built upon his own painful memories of a childhood marred by debtors prison. He wants desperately to solve the plight of child labor but doesn't know how. Unless he can discover the healing power of a simple act of charity, his dream of truly making a difference is as dead as a doornail.",5,Thought You'd Want to See What's on the Box,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,1156,"['Wow', 'great', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'unknown', 'most', 'Studio', 'dedicated', 'family', 'films', 'strengthen', 'traditional', 'family', 'values', 'entertainment', 'tape', 'even', 'Parent', 'Guide', 'printed', 'back', 'topics', 'family', 'discussion', 'Just', 'superlative', 'Now', 'story', 'Getting', 'own', 'needs', 'close', 'friend', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'thought', 'effort', 'unselfish', 'heart', 'timely', 'advice', 'given', 'author', 'write', 'only', 'profit', 'Unfortunately', 'desire', 'financial', 'security', 'only', 'own', 'fears', 'self-pity', 'When', 'soul-searching', 'peril', 'unexpected', 'help', 'young', 'girl', 'Hauntingly', 'life', 'mirrors', 'own', 'childhood', 'strange', 'events', 'Dickens', 'desire', 'refocus', 'priorities', 'wall', 'built', 'own', 'painful', 'memories', 'childhood', 'marred', 'debtors', 'prison', 'desperately', 'solve', 'plight', 'child', 'labor', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'can', 'discover', 'healing', 'power', 'simple', 'act', 'charity', 'dream', 'truly', 'making', 'difference', 'as', 'dead', 'doornail']",N/A

Being a student of Dickens and Victorian England in general, this film has to be one of the most accurate portrayals of 1840's London that I have seen. It's as if someone took a camera and found a portal into the past! The clothing and hair styles are perfect for the time period represented (1843), as is the old time dialogue spoken. Also, the actors portraying Charles and Catherine Dickens have  done their homework. Compare old paintings of the two to their filmed counterparts here. Quite astounding!The storyline itself is rather entertaining, although only having partial truth. It is more of a ghostly little tale built around a spirit-like mature young girl guiding Dickens through experiences (memories) that eventually gives the author the idea of writing his famed ""A Christmas Carol"" story. It shows the period when his latest novel, Martin Chuzzlewit, was not selling so well and, because of this frustration, words seemingly do not come to him for the writing of a new novel. But, through a series of almost other worldly circumstances, the girl shows Mr. Dickens how to search himself and the world about him to find the premise for his next story. The fact that Dickens was down on his financial luck before writing ""Carol"" is true. And, I know that his idea of the story line did not come about in quite the way this movie tells it. But that's fine - the movie itself doesn't claim to be a biography. But there are many factual biographical scenes here, such as the long walks through London at night, the way he spoke to himself as he wrote, and how he laughed out loud and cried as he completed each chapter to 'A Christmas Carol.'Lots of truth - lots of fiction. Very enjoyable.Since it's not truly a Christmas film per se, it's an excellent movie to watch in late October or early November, when it's too early to pull out your Holiday movies. It's a very enjoyable family flick that not only entertains, but has the values that seem to be missing in so many of today's films without being overly preachy.If I had to pick one inaccuracy it would be the Christmas time snow falling with trees full of leaves!By the way, this movie was filmed not in Merry Old England, but in Canada!
