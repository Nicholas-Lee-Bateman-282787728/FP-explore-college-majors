Glenn Ford has always been one of my favorite actors. He can play comedy as well as a serious part. This movie and the Sheepman are two of his many westerns I like best. These movies are tame compared to the western of C.E., but they had a good story and you could believe the character.",5,Heaven with a gun,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,385,"['have', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'format', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'can', 'play', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'serious', 'part', 'movie', 'Sheepman', 'are', 'two', 'many', 'westerns', 'like', 'best', 'movies', 'are', 'tame', 'compared', 'western', 'C.E.', 'had', 'good', 'story', 'could', 'believe', 'character']",Heaven with a Gun

There are very few movies that I dislike.  This one is good.  The suspense of how the plot will lead you is good.  Purchase this DVD people.

1637331,A3VPQLKGJO22OQ,B00BPFPNCE,"Grrrr ""GWR""","[1, 1]","Heaven With A Gun had the potential to be a great movie, and in the hands of a Anthony Mann, Henry Hathaway or Delmer Daves, it just might have been. As it stands, directed by Lee Katzin, primarily a TV director, the movie's just fair to good. What helps is the screenplay by Richard Carr. Like the part played by Glenn Ford, the characters in this movie are never quite what they seem to be, and there's more than a few surprises in store. Basically I feel that the material is worthy of a much better director. There's a surprising amount of material in the film that today would probably give it an R rating - some torture, bloodshed and nudity, so I couldn't recommend this to a younger audience. The film score, by Johnny Mandell, is just plain awful. The bad score, along with some fairly boring camera work, give the film at times, the look and feel of a made-for-TV movie, which isn't surprising considering the directors credentials.All in all, though, I recommend this Western, as  one that has a &#34;little more on it's mind&#34;  than usual Oater.
