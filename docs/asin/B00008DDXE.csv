740226,A2ELT9NS0Q8W9L,B00008DDXE,babydoh,"[36, 36]","This wonderful series is worth purchasing and watching over and over.  Even if - like me - you're not so much of a mystery aficionado, but you're just interested in watching a good story unfold, chances are you'll still become quickly engrossed.  In my particular case, I was captivated by actor Peter Davison long before I ever saw this series, so it was doubly easy for me to become involved in the stories!The set is comprised of eight episodes on four discs.  Each story is told in two parts, the first of which always ends in a perfect cliffhanger.  The four stories, all based on the books by author Margery Allingham, are entitled (in order) &quot;Look to the Lady,&quot; &quot;Police at the Funeral,&quot; &quot;The Case of the Late Pig,&quot; and &quot;Death of a Ghost.&quot; All four are wonderful, though the third is my personal favorite.  An added bonus is a fascinating special feature consisting of a behind-the-scenes look at the fourth story.As for the actors, they too are absolutely perfect.  I cannot say enough about the aforementioned Mr. Davison, who plays the role of Albert Campion beautifully and has a smile that may leave some viewers in an incoherent stupor for upwards of forty-eight hours.  (He also sings the theme music.)  Campion's assistant, Lugg, is also wonderfully played by the late Brian Glover.  The scenes between the two of them are a lot of fun to watch.Aside from the behind-the-scenes segment, the only other added feature(s) is/are the cast biographies, and some have complained that this set costs too much for something with so few add-ons - but personally I believe that it is worth every penny.",5,Worth every penny,1084406400,"05 13, 2004",2004,1646,"['wonderful', 'series', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'watching', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'much', 'mystery', 'aficionado', ""'re"", 'just', 'interested', 'watching', 'good', 'story', 'unfold', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'still', 'become', 'quickly', 'engrossed', 'particular', 'case', 'was', 'captivated', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'long', 'ever', 'saw', 'series', 'was', 'doubly', 'easy', 'become', 'involved', 'stories', 'set', 'comprised', 'eight', 'episodes', 'four', 'discs', 'story', 'told', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'always', 'perfect', 'cliffhanger', 'four', 'stories', 'based', 'books', 'author', 'Margery', 'Allingham', 'are', 'entitled', 'order', 'quot', 'Look', 'Lady', 'quot', 'quot', 'Police', 'Funeral', 'quot', 'quot', 'Case', 'Late', 'Pig', 'quot', 'quot', 'Death', 'Ghost.', 'quot', 'four', 'are', 'wonderful', 'third', 'personal', 'favorite', 'added', 'bonus', 'fascinating', 'special', 'feature', 'consisting', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'fourth', 'story.As', 'actors', 'too', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'aforementioned', 'Mr.', 'Davison', 'who', 'role', 'Albert', 'Campion', 'beautifully', 'smile', 'may', 'leave', 'viewers', 'incoherent', 'stupor', 'upwards', 'forty-eight', 'hours', 'also', 'theme', 'music', 'Campion', 'assistant', 'Lugg', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'late', 'Brian', 'Glover', 'scenes', 'two', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch.Aside', 'behind-the-scenes', 'segment', 'only', 'other', 'added', 'feature', 'is/are', 'cast', 'biographies', 'have', 'complained', 'set', 'too', 'much', 'something', 'so', 'few', 'add-ons', 'personally', 'believe', 'worth', 'penny']",N/A

Screenplay by Elaine Morgan.Peter Davison as Albert Campion and his faithful companion Brian Glover as Magersfontein Lugg are so good in this 1989 TV series that even when you read the book you think of them. The story is abbreviated and takes a little time to get off the ground; however first time through the program you will notice some standard ploys as a person confessing that has a good chance of actually being the culprit (how many times have we seen this?)  By the second viewing, you see the clues that you missed, and you are hooked.In this installment, Lugg (Brian Glover) gets a peripheral part, which is disappointing. Campion is present for an unveiling of a painting form the deceased artist. Suddenly the lights go out and someone is dispatched; however, this is not the mystery.Soon the secondary artist that was dispatched is being forgotten as all his paintings are disappearing. What is this, a nefarious plot by some cabal and to what end?

Not as much comedy as the latter but certainly a period piece of the 1930s that has great costumes and sets. Often a case deals with a wealthy client that has an estate in the country. It doesn't move at a fast pace until near the climax of the case. It may seem a bit slow at first, but well worth a little patience.Albert Campion, played by Peter Davison, is not your average detective nor is his assistant Magersfontein Lugg, Brian Glover. He receives the ocassional assistance from his friend Chief Instpector Stanislaus Oates, played by Andrew Burt. He is not at all the bumbling inspector sometimes portrayed in some series, but is helpful and resourceful. Campion is charming and although he may seem quite whimsical at times, he's always completely attuned to what is happening around him. Lugg is quite adept at fereting out information at the local pubs or from the butlers, maids, and other hired help of the estates. A bit of a brute with a thick accent, he's always fun to watch in action. The cases are always interesting and show us a fascinating window into the society of this period.The DVD quality is excellent and picture and sound are sharp and clear.

740241,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00008DDXE,C. O. DeRiemer,"[9, 9]","Is it possible that the English upper classes could simply be too well bred for their own good? Probably not as long their money holds out. But for a mystery series, maybe. With Campion, a BBC series that ran two seasons in 1989 and 1990, we have Peter Davison as Albert Campion, bespectacled, balding, well bred, well educated and well off. In the stylish world of 1930s wealth and society, Campion has dedicated himself to solving crimes and catching villains. These crimes almost always put him among equally well bred and well-off members of the upper class, in their stately homes and country houses, amongst their daughters and their horses, and amongst their black-sheep relatives.The series is drawn from the mystery novels of Margery Allingham who, as so many British mystery writers of the Twenties and Thirties did, specialized in civilized crime. When the mysteries were good, they were very good. When they weren't (or when they became dated), they usually seemed to represent a way of life we are well rid of (except, of course, we aren't. It's just the cut of the dinner dress and the price of the vices that has changed.)For me, the Campion television mysteries are a mixed blessing. On the plus side, Peter Davison makes an engaging, intelligent and sympathetic protagonist. He's one of the most likable actors I've ever seen, whether he's playing a young country vet inAll Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1 Collectionor a put-upon, middle-aged detective constable inThe Last Detective - Series 1. The mysteries are often satisfyingly complicated and the production looks like a million dollars (or pounds). The BBC spent what it took to make the upper classes' dress, their homes, their gardens and their cars look as if it were all theirs by right. Campion drives a red (Triumph, I think) roadster I'd be tempted to sell my children for. On the down side, Campion sets his traps with cleverness, but much of the time he spends listening with his eyebrows slightly raised. Combined with the excruciating gentility of the world he moves in, the episodes, which run close to two hours each, more often than not had me dozing off now and then. I'll admit to being something of a Leveler, but those who worry unduly about whether to send the port to the left or the right have always seemed more silly than sympathetic.Campion and his manservant, the ex-burglar Magersfontein Lugg (Brian Glover), find themselves involved in four cases in this first season. One is a standout and another is very good. My favorite is Police at the Funeral. Campion finds himself in a country home stuffed with good breeding...but also stuffed full of resentments old and new, and with bizarre murders that seem to have no solution or rationale. Campion also must deal with the singularly stiff upper lip of the ancient doyen of the family. Mary Morris, 75, tiny, spare and wrinkled, plays this authoritative woman. She dominates the proceedings. Morris died shortly after production was finished. Forty-eight years earlier, in 1941, Mary Morris played Ludmilla Koslowsky, the young woman Leslie Howard, playing Professor Horatio Smith, fell in love with inPimpernel Smith, If you can track down this old movie, it's still a great one. A nice job also is done with Death of a Ghost, a tale of more resentments and murder, this time mixed with envy and famous paintings.

This is a relatively new development and I encourage you to check it out if you're not a Prime member already.As a result of this new movie access I found the Campion series of British TV mysteries; having enjoyed Campion as played by Peter Davison we selected it for viewing and have really enjoyed Season 1 all over again. Peter Davison as Campion and Brian Glover as Lugg both do excellent jobs in their respective rolls and is fun to watch. I'll have to admit the heavy accent used by Glover in portraying Lugg makes understanding what he is saying something of a challenge from time to time.The individual mysteries are all two parters and utilize the time honored cliff-hanger technique which leaves the viewer eager to watch the next segment of the story. Fortunately in this case one has the option of immediately viewing the second part so one doesn't have to suffer in suspense too long.One minor shortcoming is the movie versions don't reveal the thinking processes that Campion goes through to solve the mysteries that are more fully revealed in the books. That doesn't seriously compromise the movie versions but may leave the viewer wondering how Campion came up with that conclusion.These are an enjoyable series of British mysteries and are especially fun to watch if you have video streaming capability and are a member of Amazon Prime.,5,British Mystery That's Fun and Well Done!,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,1485,"['One', 'great', 'new', 'benefits', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'membership', 'access', 'many', 'Amazon', 'movies', 'free', 'part', 'Prime', 'membership', 'relatively', 'new', 'development', 'encourage', 'check', 'out', ""'re"", 'not', 'Prime', 'member', 'already.As', 'result', 'new', 'movie', 'access', 'found', 'Campion', 'series', 'British', 'TV', 'mysteries', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'Campion', 'played', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'selected', 'viewing', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Season', '1', 'over', 'again', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'Campion', 'Brian', 'Glover', 'Lugg', 'do', 'excellent', 'jobs', 'respective', 'rolls', 'fun', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'have', 'admit', 'heavy', 'accent', 'used', 'Glover', 'portraying', 'Lugg', 'understanding', 'what', 'saying', 'something', 'challenge', 'time', 'time.The', 'individual', 'mysteries', 'are', 'two', 'parters', 'utilize', 'time', 'honored', 'cliff-hanger', 'technique', 'viewer', 'eager', 'watch', 'next', 'segment', 'story', 'Fortunately', 'case', 'one', 'option', 'immediately', 'viewing', 'second', 'part', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'suffer', 'suspense', 'too', 'long.One', 'minor', 'shortcoming', 'movie', 'versions', 'do', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'thinking', 'Campion', 'solve', 'mysteries', 'are', 'more', 'fully', 'revealed', 'books', ""n't"", 'seriously', 'compromise', 'movie', 'versions', 'may', 'leave', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'how', 'Campion', 'came', 'up', 'conclusion.These', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'British', 'mysteries', 'are', 'especially', 'fun', 'watch', 'have', 'video', 'streaming', 'capability', 'are', 'member', 'Amazon', 'Prime']",N/A

Allingham's debonaire sleuth has a different background, than Marsh's Allyn or Sayers' Wimsey. Although of somewhat noble birth, he was born on the `wrong side of the covers' and his name does not reflect his pedigree. The name Campion is taken from a small white field flower that he sometimes wore in his buttonhole.Unfortunately, this and other bits of trivia are missing from these DVDs, because the BBC videos are missing `Mystery Theater' hostess Diana Rigg who introduced the stories to PBS viewers and often shed additional light on the background of the protagonist and his sidekick valet-sometimes chauffeur of his car (which can give Morse's red sports car a run for the money any day) the former house breaker and very talented Mr. Lugg.The first season includes episodes that feature: 1/ the ancient family secret of one of Campion's old school chums which involves a frightening sight that leads to death; 2/ A poisoner removing the members of an old family of Campion's acquaintance; 3/ The death of a bully who made Campion's life as a child hell; 4/ An artists family plagued by his misjudgements and misadventures long after his death.Like Christie, Allingham excelled in stagecraft and her plots as well as her characterizations of Campion (played by Peter Davison -- `All Creatures Great and Small' and ""At Home With the Braithwaites) and Lugg are well done. Some of the peripheral actors are also well drawn, although occasionally a few are over-the-top which has more to do with dramatization than text. We learn more and more about Albert and his manservent as time goes by, but it would have been nice to have Lady Diana introducing each episode as some of the humor might be missed by those not familiar with the series.

Brian Glover is equally adept at treading the fine line between tongue firmly in cheek and over-the-top parody as the aptly named Lugg, Campion's Dr. Watson-cum-Jeeves, who also conveniently happens to be a reformed burglar, as well as stalwart companion.The production clearly has great fun plundering the BBC's vast prop and set warehouses for forays as disparately far afield from London's more fashionable neighborhoods as lunatic backwater village witchcraft and the fulsome vanities of West End theatre stars--always with impeccable style, to be sure--yet somehow nearly always seeming to involve at least one grand country house as well as Lugg's convenient access to the secrets lurking beneath the surface in the downstairs realm and/or the criminal underworld.Quite true, we have seen it all before, and so have the people who put this series together, which yields a delightfully entertaining, if not irreverently ironic twist on the tatty old tropes of the period whodunnit without ever stooping to the silliness of Monty Python.  To call Campion ""post-modernist"" would be much too pretentious, yet it's surprisingly smart TV.

A disowned and derelict son must return to a castle where his forebears guard an ancient sacred chalice.  It's a bit of a quest and a treasure hunt, mixed in with peculiar secrets, religion and thieves.  It's a little difficult to figure out just what is going on, even at the conclusion.""Death of a Ghost"" brings Campion to an artist colony where everyone is a little off the wall and living off the charitable legacy of a once great artist named Lafcadio.  His widow unveils a Lafcadio painting each year from a stock  left in storage just to perpetuate his name.  Ah but there is a secret about these paintings and the plot thickens with Lafcadio red, made from a paint formula known only to a few people.  Frankly, this episode gets a bit hammy all around (artists are so emotional) and Campion could use some rescuing himself.""Police at the Funeral"" is a misnomer, because there never is a funeral.  What there might be is a murder trial for a family of rather stupid offspring living off their very old, rich mother.  They bicker, annoy each other on purpose, and cope with numerous character flaws, while living in a rather creepy old mansion.  Mom keeps control of the pursestrings, because none of them can be trusted to do anything right.  Campion must find out what has happened to a family member who has disappeared, and solve the great secret behind some blackmail.""Death of the Late Pig"" brings Campion back to his old stamping grounds and a former girlfriend who still has a  crush on him.  Her father needs help solving a murder.  Someone has figured out a way to drop a stone urn off the roof and kill an old school chum of Campion's nicknamed ""Pig"" because of a disgusting snorting sound that seems to be inherited.
