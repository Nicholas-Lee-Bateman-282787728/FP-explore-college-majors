1240400,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001UV4XGU,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Sunshine Cleaning, 2009 filmA woman is fired from her job at a restaurant. What will she do next? Can her cleaning skills be applied in a new job? A friend tells her about the high costs of crime scene cleanup (after the body was removed). Rose cleans houses, she meets an old schoolmate. What happened? [Do they look the same ages?] Rose gets a call from school - her son is in trouble. [No male role model?] They tell her the son must take medication - or go to a new school. Can she find a higher paying job cleaning up crime scenes? [What about her boyfriend&#8217;s life?] Do they live in a small town? She and her sister Laura clean up a smelly room. There is conflict. They find maggots! Also pictures of a young girl. They shop for the cleaning supplies they need. Are they charging too little? They learn about the rules for bio-hazard disposal.Rose learns news about her boyfriend&#8217;s wife. Laura enters an elevator; was she following a lady? Rose visits that motel but her boyfriend is a no-show. Laura looks into a small box. Rose gets tips on future employers. Rose attends a class to learn more. Heather meets her in a store. &#8220;Business acumen&#8221; means buying shrimp from a wholesale dealer. Next a man driving a car has a heart attack and drives into a plate glass storefront. There is a call about a suicide in a room - a bloody chair tells the story. [You&#8217;ll never see these details on any TV crime show.] Grandpa&#8217;s offer of a shrimp sale is refused. [Know your seller?] The story runs on. [Does Laura&#8217;s stunt by the railroad tracks suggest suicidal thinking?] Rose&#8217;s boyfriend drops by with a gift. Both are refused. Does Rose have a future here?Rose gets a call from an insurance company. Laura must begin by herself. Rose needs a sitter for her boy (her father is incapacitated). She goes to a baby shower and talks about her business (talking too much?). Laura runs out after a kitten. There is an avoidable accident! [Does this remind you of a &#8220;Seinfeld&#8221; episode?] &#8220;It was an accident.&#8221; Will insurance cover it? Rose needs a new job. Laura gives some pictures to Heather; will she appreciate this? Oscar has a birthday party. Rose talks to Laura; can she take care of her? [Don&#8217;t both sisters suffer from poor judgment on important decisions?] Later Rose talks on the CB. &#8220;I hope you can hear me.&#8221; She is back to cleaning as a maid. Her father sold his home and invested in a business. Will this be a success? [I hope so.]This could be a lesson on &#8220;How not to Ruin you Life&#8221;. Why were Rose and Laura motherless? Was this the cause of their poor decisions (lack of a role model - no aunts or adult friends)? What did their father do (or not do)? It seems foolish for a small family to not live together - one rent payment instead of three. Or did advertising tell them they should work for the landlord? [You can see or hear these ideas in the media.] Living together provides support for family members, that is why it has been going on forever. But those who need this advice imaging they know better - until its too late. Would Rose&#8217;s father (or aunt) give her good advice about her relationship with a married man? A young boy raised by a single mother alone can have some problems. So too a divorce can create problems for children (no fault of theirs, but they may feel guilty).",3,Hopes and Failures,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,3402,"['Sunshine', 'Cleaning', '2009', 'filmA', 'woman', 'fired', 'job', 'restaurant', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'Can', 'cleaning', 'skills', 'be', 'applied', 'new', 'job', 'friend', 'high', 'costs', 'crime', 'scene', 'cleanup', 'body', 'was', 'removed', 'Rose', 'cleans', 'houses', 'old', 'schoolmate', 'What', 'happened', '[', 'Do', 'look', 'same', 'ages', ']', 'Rose', 'call', 'school', 'son', 'trouble', '[', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'tell', 'son', 'must', 'take', 'medication', 'go', 'new', 'school', 'Can', 'find', 'higher', 'paying', 'job', 'cleaning', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', '[', 'What', 'boyfriend', '8217', 'life', ']', 'Do', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'sister', 'Laura', 'up', 'smelly', 'room', 'conflict', 'find', 'maggots', 'Also', 'young', 'girl', 'shop', 'cleaning', 'supplies', 'need', 'Are', 'charging', 'too', 'little', 'learn', 'rules', 'bio-hazard', 'disposal.Rose', 'news', 'boyfriend', '8217', 's', 'wife', 'Laura', 'elevator', 'was', 'following', 'lady', 'Rose', 'motel', 'boyfriend', 'no-show', 'Laura', 'small', 'box', 'Rose', 'tips', 'future', 'employers', 'Rose', 'class', 'learn', 'more', 'Heather', 'store', '8220', 'Business', 'acumen', '8221', 'buying', 'shrimp', 'wholesale', 'dealer', 'man', 'driving', 'car', 'heart', 'attack', 'plate', 'glass', 'storefront', 'call', 'suicide', 'room', 'bloody', 'chair', 'story', '8217', 'never', 'see', 'details', 'TV', 'crime', 'show', ']', 'Grandpa', '8217', 'offer', 'shrimp', 'sale', 'refused', '[', 'Know', 'seller', 'story', '[', 'Does', 'Laura', '8217', 'stunt', 'railroad', 'suggest', 'suicidal', 'thinking', ']', 'Rose', '8217', 'boyfriend', 'drops', 'gift', 'are', 'refused', 'Does', 'Rose', 'have', 'future', 'here', 'Rose', 'call', 'insurance', 'company', 'Laura', 'must', 'begin', 'Rose', 'sitter', 'boy', 'father', 'incapacitated', 'baby', 'shower', 'talks', 'business', 'talking', 'too', 'much', 'Laura', 'out', 'kitten', 'avoidable', 'accident', '[', 'remind', '8220', 'Seinfeld', '8221', ']', '8220', 'was', 'accident.', '8221', 'Will', 'insurance', 'cover', 'Rose', 'new', 'job', 'Laura', 'pictures', 'Heather', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Oscar', 'birthday', 'party', 'Rose', 'talks', 'Laura', 'can', 'take', 'care', '[', 'Don', '8217', 'sisters', 'suffer', 'poor', 'judgment', 'important', 'decisions', ']', 'Later', 'Rose', 'talks', 'CB', '8220', 'hope', 'can', 'hear', 'me.', '8221', 'back', 'cleaning', 'maid', 'father', 'sold', 'home', 'invested', 'business', 'Will', 'be', 'success', '[', 'hope', 'so', ']', 'could', 'be', 'lesson', '8220', 'How', 'not', 'Ruin', 'Life', '8221', 'Why', 'were', 'Rose', 'Laura', 'motherless', 'Was', 'cause', 'poor', 'decisions', 'lack', 'role', 'model', 'aunts', 'adult', 'friends', 'What', 'did', 'father', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'foolish', 'small', 'family', 'not', 'live', 'together', 'one', 'rent', 'payment', 'instead', 'three', 'did', 'advertising', 'tell', 'should', 'work', 'landlord', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'ideas', 'media', ']', 'Living', 'together', 'support', 'family', 'members', 'why', 'been', 'going', 'forever', 'who', 'need', 'advice', 'imaging', 'know', 'better', 'too', 'late', 'Would', 'Rose', '8217', 'father', 'aunt', 'give', 'good', 'advice', 'relationship', 'married', 'man', 'young', 'boy', 'raised', 'single', 'mother', 'alone', 'can', 'have', 'problems', 'So', 'too', 'divorce', 'can', 'create', 'problems', 'children', 'fault', 'theirs', 'may', 'feel', 'guilty']",N/A

She is undeniably appealing and attractive but she doesn't shirk more difficult roles, as in her superb performance in ""Junebug.""This movie sees her taking the role of Rose, the older sister in a dysfunctional family, cut adrift (SPOILER WARNING) by the suicide of the mother. Rose is the responsible sister, a single mother working hard as a house cleaner to support her young son, Oscar, while keeping an eye on the younger sister Norah, also well-portrayed by Emily Blunt.Alan Arkin is their father and gives a great performance as a loving but unreliable grandfather, still trying to hit it big with various silly business ventures.Norah is a walking disaster, losing jobs, incapable even of babysitting Oscar is a responsible way. But Rose has also come adrift. She was once the head of the high school cheerleading squad and girlfriend to the quarterback. Now, she rushes to squalid assignations with that same ex-quaterback in nasty motel rooms. He's Oscar's father but he married someone else.Where did Rose go wrong? How and why did she go offtrack? We aren't told but it feels fake. A character like Rose is built for success, not failure.When the opportunity arises to start a business (Sunshine Cleaning) that cleans up houses and offices after violent deaths have occurred, Rose seizes it as a chance for redemption both for herself and Norah. For a while things go well but then disaster strikes.This movie at its heart is about a family torn asunder by a suicide and its attempts to heal itself. The acting is good but the plot is very cliche-ridden. I was able to predict almost every development several steps ahead. And the end feels a bit cheap and easy.

Actually, while still very funny in places, it ended up being much more dramatic than expected, and a nice little film about family and growing up. Starring my new favorite actress, a dressed-down Amy Adams, and Emily Blunt as her irresponsible younger sister, it follows their adventures as they start their own business, cleaning up crime scenes. The ride takes them on several side roads, including class reunions and a strange friendship with Mary Lynn Rajskub (""Chloe"" of '24').

My lady gets kudos to her for picking out a film that we both enjoyed thoroughly. I was pleasantly surprised at how real these characters were and the movie actually made me smile at the end.It was a little predictable in the writing (what isn't) but I appreciated how the characters had flaws as most films try too hard to give you some false sense of security at the end.  I do understand that most people don't want to watch real life on film as they live it every day but it is nice to switch it up from time to time.  I don't have to watch a film and fall in love with ""tragic characters"" if I want to do that I will watch a chick flick.  It is very rare that film makers just make a movie about something that hasn't been touched upon too much (the people that clean up after deaths and suicide.SPOILERS!!!This movie is about the selfish act of suicide and the impact it has on the people you leave behind.  Yeah, they cleaned up dead people's houses and there were a couple of pokes at humor in this film but I would really classify this film as a drama.  Amy Adams films are usually geared toward one demographic and it was nice to see her in a different light.  I also enjoyed Emily Blunt's Performance as the perpetual loser that needed to find a way to cope with her mother's death and had no outlet.  Alan Arkin was barely recognizable in this movie but he gave a good performance.  Clifton Collins Jr. is a great actor and just about every film I have seen him in he is outstanding, he plays an Industrial Cleaning Shop Owner with one arm and an affinity for building models.  He didn't have a big role in this film but when he was on screen he overshadowed the others by far IMHO.  I recommend this film to anyone that wants to watch a film about how life has its ups and downs and how families struggle with life and death.  I would rate this at 4 1/2 stars due to the lack of original writing when it came to predictability on the ending but we will round up in this instance.-fin",5,finally a movie about life,1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,2127,"['wife', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'months', 'based', 'trailer', 'am', 'thinking', 'typical', 'chick', 'flick', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'trailer', 'lady', 'kudos', 'picking', 'out', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'real', 'characters', 'were', 'movie', 'actually', 'made', 'smile', 'end.It', 'was', 'little', 'predictable', 'writing', 'what', ""n't"", 'appreciated', 'how', 'characters', 'had', 'flaws', 'most', 'films', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'give', 'false', 'sense', 'security', 'end', 'do', 'understand', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'live', 'day', 'nice', 'switch', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'fall', 'love', 'tragic', 'characters', 'want', 'do', 'will', 'watch', 'chick', 'flick', 'very', 'rare', 'film', 'makers', 'just', 'make', 'movie', 'something', ""n't"", 'been', 'touched', 'too', 'much', 'people', 'clean', 'up', 'deaths', 'suicide.SPOILERS', 'movie', 'selfish', 'act', 'suicide', 'impact', 'people', 'leave', 'Yeah', 'cleaned', 'up', 'dead', 'people', 'houses', 'were', 'couple', 'pokes', 'humor', 'film', 'would', 'really', 'classify', 'film', 'drama', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'films', 'are', 'usually', 'geared', 'one', 'demographic', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'different', 'light', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Performance', 'perpetual', 'loser', 'needed', 'find', 'way', 'cope', 'mother', 'death', 'had', 'outlet', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'was', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'movie', 'gave', 'good', 'performance', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'great', 'actor', 'just', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'outstanding', 'Industrial', 'Cleaning', 'Shop', 'Owner', 'one', 'arm', 'affinity', 'building', 'models', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'role', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'screen', 'overshadowed', 'others', 'far', 'IMHO', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'watch', 'film', 'how', 'life', 'ups', 'downs', 'how', 'families', 'struggle', 'life', 'death', 'would', 'rate', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'due', 'lack', 'original', 'writing', 'when', 'came', 'predictability', 'ending', 'will', 'round', 'up', 'instance.-fin']",N/A

Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[0, 0]","Sunshine Cleaning is a pleasantly watchable movie, there are moments are pure hilarity, and underlying this are some very real and occassionally beautifully revealed motivations. The director, Christine Jeffs, almost nails this movie however I think she just misses the mark.Sunshine Cleaning is about Rose (Amy Adams) and her sister Norah (the extraodinary Emily Blunt) who are lost. Rose is cleaning houses and reciting self-help mantras. Norah is constantly losing menial jobs. Their father is always on the look out for an opportunity, which doesn't always work out. Rose is having an affair with a cop who turns out is significantly from her past/ Everything comes to a head though when not only is her young son expelled from schoo, but she meets a woman she is cleaning house for who was in her cheerleading squad at school. It is beautifully played scene you can just feel Rose's quiet desparation to be more than she is.Rose sets up Sunshine Cleaning - a company to clean up crime scenes -  with her sister. She wants to make money - to get her son into private school and to fund her real estate studies. After a few false starts (cleaning old blood up with toothbrushes), she begins to be more professional about it. In fact she starts to really like it. In the background however is her son, who has problems of his own and needs to go to a sympathetic school.There are utterly excellent set ups in this, the cleaning is at times gross-out, at other times hlarious. Adams and Blunt are dynamic as sisters and Alan Arkin plays a great father. The one-armed cleaning retailer (don't know his name sorry) did a pretty star turn too. Jeff's direction around the suicides and the girls own issues is done incredibly well - I love the way she doesn't telegraph what is happening, but rather lets the audience into the issue little by little.What really didn't work was the wrapping up of the loose ends. It just didn't seem to gel to me. Why did Norah do what she did in the end - it just seemed an excuse to get rid of her, why did Arkin do what he did - again it didn't seem explained to me. It seemed as though the movie needed to be wrapped up and that was the easiest way to do it.Also the filming - I realise that there is a reality element, and perhaps it is supposed to reflect the characters own lives, but the scenes were so astonishingly dark at times I could barely see a thing.Amy Adams is great, a real little battler however I thought Emily Blunt was outstanding. Having just seen her in Young Victoria, I knew that she was in this movie, I would never have been able to pick that this is the same woman. Her range and conviction is amazing. She is definitely an actress to watch.",4,"Pleasantly watchable, but lacking in purpose",1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,2701,"['Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'pleasantly', 'watchable', 'movie', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'pure', 'hilarity', 'underlying', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'occassionally', 'beautifully', 'revealed', 'motivations', 'director', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'almost', 'movie', 'however', 'think', 'just', 'mark.Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'Rose', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'sister', 'Norah', 'extraodinary', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'who', 'are', 'lost', 'Rose', 'cleaning', 'houses', 'reciting', 'self-help', 'mantras', 'Norah', 'constantly', 'losing', 'menial', 'jobs', 'father', 'always', 'look', 'out', 'opportunity', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'out', 'Rose', 'having', 'affair', 'cop', 'who', 'out', 'significantly', 'past/', 'Everything', 'head', 'when', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'son', 'expelled', 'schoo', 'woman', 'cleaning', 'house', 'who', 'was', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'school', 'beautifully', 'played', 'scene', 'can', 'just', 'feel', 'Rose', 'quiet', 'desparation', 'be', 'more', 'is.Rose', 'sets', 'up', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'company', 'clean', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'sister', 'make', 'money', 'get', 'son', 'private', 'school', 'fund', 'real', 'estate', 'studies', 'few', 'false', 'starts', 'cleaning', 'old', 'blood', 'up', 'toothbrushes', 'be', 'more', 'professional', 'fact', 'really', 'like', 'background', 'however', 'son', 'who', 'problems', 'own', 'go', 'sympathetic', 'school.There', 'are', 'utterly', 'excellent', 'set', 'ups', 'cleaning', 'times', 'gross-out', 'other', 'times', 'hlarious', 'Adams', 'Blunt', 'are', 'dynamic', 'sisters', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'great', 'father', 'one-armed', 'cleaning', 'retailer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'sorry', 'did', 'pretty', 'star', 'turn', 'too', 'Jeff', 'direction', 'suicides', 'girls', 'own', 'issues', 'done', 'incredibly', 'well', 'love', 'way', ""n't"", 'telegraph', 'what', 'happening', 'rather', 'audience', 'issue', 'little', 'little.What', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'wrapping', 'loose', 'ends', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'gel', 'Why', 'did', 'Norah', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'end', 'just', 'seemed', 'excuse', 'get', 'rid', 'why', 'did', 'Arkin', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'explained', 'seemed', 'movie', 'needed', 'be', 'wrapped', 'up', 'was', 'easiest', 'way', 'do', 'it.Also', 'filming', 'realise', 'reality', 'element', 'perhaps', 'supposed', 'reflect', 'characters', 'own', 'lives', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'astonishingly', 'dark', 'times', 'could', 'barely', 'see', 'thing.Amy', 'Adams', 'great', 'real', 'little', 'battler', 'however', 'thought', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Having', 'just', 'seen', 'Young', 'Victoria', 'knew', 'was', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'pick', 'same', 'woman', 'range', 'conviction', 'amazing', 'definitely', 'actress', 'watch']",N/A

Rose (Amy Adams) is a single mom of a precocious 8 year old.  She was the head cheerleader in high school, but now her life has taken a turn for the worse, and she's cleaning houses to make ends meet.  Her sister Nora (Emily Blunt) is a wild child who is always losing her jobs because she isn't reliable.  Rose gets a tip from her boyfriend that there is money to be made in cleaning up crime scenes, and the sisters set up their own business.  Alan Arkin also stars as the girls eccentric father.This movie was touching and a little bit sad--in the way that real life movies often are--with just enough sunshine around the edges to keep it from being depressing.  I think the two women were superb, they did a great job of capturing the emotions wrapped up in these women's difficult lives.  It wasn't depressing, but it was a movie you can really get emotionally involved with.I would recommend this film to someone looking for a good art-house type movie with interesting characters.

It's about two sisters who work with each other by driving around a small town and cleaning up bloody homes after a gruesome murder or suicide takes place.The concept sounds good, but the quality of the storyline is *really* underwhelming and downright boring.It's supposed to be a drama with light elements of comedy, but it's never interesting or funny enough to win over the viewing audience so it's basically a completely pointless movie.I truly fail to see the appeal of this film. The side stories are equally disappointing. Who cares that the little boy had a licking problem at school for instance, because the storyline surrounding it is underdeveloped and unsatisfying anyway. The guy missing an arm had no reason to even be featured because he wasn't utilized correctly. A few brief appearances means the writers had *something* in mind for his character, but whatever it was never came to fruition.The constant arguments between the sisters are always uninteresting and meaningless.  You sit there wondering when the arguing will ever actually end up GOING somewhere, but it never does.The only moment that saves it comes at the very end when *something* happens (I don't want to spoil it, even though you most likely will have done turned it over by this point).

1240413,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B001UV4XGU,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[0, 0]","Director Christine Jeffs' ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is a terrific example of what independent films do best; offer rewarding character studies of believable people, without all the gloss and overkill of major studio features. While the subject matter may seem distasteful (cleaning up crime scenes), this is really a film about family, growing up, and discovering life paths, played by an exceptional cast.Amy Adams surprises me more, with each film, and she is simply perfect, here, as the older of two sisters, whose prestige and promise in high school was derailed after graduation by having a son out of wedlock. While her classmates went on to bigger things, she focused on raising her son, accepting work as a maid, while struggling to earn a real estate license. Adams captures both the beauty and optimism that continues to enthrall her now-married high school boyfriend (Steve Zahn), as well as the growing desperation of a mother trying to provide for her child (Jason Spevack). As her younger, non-conformist sister, British actress Emily Blunt is equally good, trying to establish a life of her own, yet sensitive to the pain of others. The always terrific Alan Arkin (everybody's favorite father/grandfather figure) rounds out the family, as their loving, dreamer dad.When the opportunity to make quick cash doing a crime scene clean-up appears, Adams and Blunt grab it, doing nearly everything wrong, but seeing a bigger check than being a maid or waitress could provide. They start a business, steered in the right direction by a one-armed, likably laconic supplier (Clifton Collins Jr., in another stand-out performance), and with the newly-coined 'Sunshine Cleaning', the entire family will experience joy, pain, frustration, and ultimately, renewal. The journey is an emotionally rewarding one for viewers, and makes the film quite wonderful!A very interesting 'Making Of"" featurette is included, with the observations of two women who actually provide crime scene clean-up, and it is a fascinating look at an unusual job.""Sunshine Cleaning"" has some flaws, but is certainly one of the better films I've watched this year!",4,"Wonderfully Quirky, Rich Comedy/Drama...",1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,2134,"['Director', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'terrific', 'example', 'what', 'independent', 'films', 'do', 'best', 'offer', 'rewarding', 'character', 'studies', 'believable', 'people', 'gloss', 'overkill', 'major', 'studio', 'features', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'seem', 'distasteful', 'cleaning', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'really', 'film', 'family', 'growing', 'up', 'discovering', 'life', 'paths', 'played', 'exceptional', 'cast.Amy', 'Adams', 'more', 'film', 'simply', 'perfect', 'here', 'older', 'two', 'sisters', 'prestige', 'promise', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'derailed', 'graduation', 'having', 'son', 'wedlock', 'classmates', 'went', 'bigger', 'things', 'focused', 'raising', 'son', 'accepting', 'work', 'maid', 'struggling', 'earn', 'real', 'estate', 'license', 'Adams', 'beauty', 'optimism', 'enthrall', 'now-married', 'high', 'school', 'boyfriend', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'as', 'well', 'growing', 'desperation', 'mother', 'trying', 'provide', 'child', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'younger', 'non-conformist', 'sister', 'British', 'actress', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'equally', 'good', 'trying', 'establish', 'life', 'own', 'yet', 'sensitive', 'pain', 'others', 'always', 'terrific', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'father/grandfather', 'figure', 'out', 'family', 'loving', 'dreamer', 'dad.When', 'opportunity', 'make', 'quick', 'cash', 'doing', 'crime', 'scene', 'clean-up', 'Adams', 'Blunt', 'grab', 'doing', 'nearly', 'everything', 'wrong', 'seeing', 'bigger', 'check', 'being', 'maid', 'waitress', 'could', 'provide', 'start', 'business', 'steered', 'right', 'direction', 'one-armed', 'likably', 'laconic', 'supplier', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'newly-coined', ""'Sunshine"", 'Cleaning', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'experience', 'joy', 'pain', 'frustration', 'ultimately', 'renewal', 'journey', 'emotionally', 'rewarding', 'one', 'viewers', 'film', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'very', 'interesting', ""'Making"", 'featurette', 'included', 'observations', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'actually', 'provide', 'crime', 'scene', 'clean-up', 'fascinating', 'look', 'unusual', 'job', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'flaws', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'films', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'year']",N/A

From many of the previews, you might think it to be a quirky comedy; and on some, short level it is. But it is far from comedic. It is touching and brilliantly acted, has a bare-bones script that cuts straight to the heart, and surprises you at nearly every turn. But it's really not that funny. Oh it has its moments for sure, but you've seen them all in the previews (one of the sisters falling down on a heavily fouled mattress, etc.).The basic story surrounds two sisters, Rose (Amy Adams,Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day) and Norah (Emily Blunt,The Devil Wears Prada), who struggle at different ends of the same rope; a rope that represents their lives and is knotted in the center by the suicide-death of their beautiful mother. Tugging in one direction is Rose, a single mom trying to make ends meet by working as a cleaning woman and having an affair with former high school - and now married - sweetheart Mac (Steve Zahn,Happy, Texas). Life hasn't worked out the way Rose has hoped after high school, where she was on the cheerleading team. Problems quickly surface for her as her only child Oscar (Jason Spevack,Hollywoodland) gets booted from his elementary school for bizarre behavior. Needing to send him to a specialty school (that is expensive) she falls into a job as a crime scene clean-up specialist after getting the advice from lover Mac.Tugging the other direction is Norah, the sister who can't (or refuses) to hold down a steady job ...except for babysitting Oscar and telling him horror stories about the Lobster Monster (another of the few funny moments in the film). Rose convinces Norah to join her in her new blood and body fluid cleaning business, and the two of them quickly learn how lucrative it can be, and how little they know about its machinations (""You can't throw contaminated human material into dumpsters?""). But Rose is doing it for her son so that she can afford to send him to an appropriate school, and Norah is doing it so that she can be close to her sister and, perhaps, protect her from some of what might come trickling back, like memories of their mother's death.Amongst all of this comes Oscars birthday and his desire for a pair of binoculars. Grandpa Joe (Alan Arkin,Little Miss Sunshine) has promised to get him a very expensive pair and has to come up with the cash quickly, leading him to make a financial misstep and end up with tons of rotten seafood. It is here that everything comes to a head. Rose and Norah remember that their mother had a bit part in a small TV production and they see a re-run of it one day from the respective homes and this helps remove some of the knot in that rope that each of them holds on to. They also remember that she killed herself in the family bathtub and when Norah enters her father's house and smells death coming from the bathroom, the memories flood back in. She races in and finds her father bailing dead shrimp from the tub. This was quite a moment if one pays attention.It is the intermix of relationships and how each character deals or doesn't deal with them that holds this film together and makes it a surprising success. Amy Adams does another great job acting as a vulnerable yet determined woman trying to make good for her son. Emily Blunt is stunning as the confused and embittered sister who loves the smell of everything her mother left behind and deals with her puzzled relationships. Even Jason Spevack does a good job as the weird kid trying to understand what his family is going through and how he's supposed to act.If you're in the mood for a good character film, and not necessarily a rousing comedy, you might try tugging on this one.",4,Tugs In All The Right Directions,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,3743,"['***CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS***SUNSHINE', 'CLEANING', 'dark', 'dirty', 'side', ""n't"", 'what', 'think', 'many', 'previews', 'might', 'think', 'be', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'short', 'level', 'far', 'comedic', 'touching', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'bare-bones', 'script', 'straight', 'heart', 'nearly', 'turn', 'really', 'not', 'funny', 'Oh', 'moments', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previews', 'one', 'sisters', 'falling', 'down', 'heavily', 'fouled', 'mattress', 'etc', '.The', 'basic', 'story', 'surrounds', 'two', 'sisters', 'Rose', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'Day', 'Norah', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'who', 'struggle', 'different', 'ends', 'same', 'rope', 'rope', 'lives', 'knotted', 'center', 'suicide-death', 'beautiful', 'mother', 'Tugging', 'one', 'direction', 'Rose', 'single', 'mom', 'trying', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'working', 'cleaning', 'woman', 'having', 'affair', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'now', 'married', 'sweetheart', 'Mac', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Happy', 'Texas', 'Life', ""n't"", 'worked', 'out', 'way', 'Rose', 'hoped', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'was', 'cheerleading', 'team', 'Problems', 'quickly', 'surface', 'only', 'child', 'Oscar', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'Hollywoodland', 'booted', 'elementary', 'school', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'Needing', 'send', 'specialty', 'school', 'expensive', 'job', 'crime', 'scene', 'clean-up', 'specialist', 'getting', 'advice', 'lover', 'Mac.Tugging', 'other', 'direction', 'Norah', 'sister', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'down', 'steady', 'job', 'babysitting', 'Oscar', 'telling', 'horror', 'stories', 'Lobster', 'Monster', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'Rose', 'convinces', 'Norah', 'join', 'new', 'blood', 'body', 'fluid', 'cleaning', 'business', 'two', 'quickly', 'learn', 'how', 'lucrative', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'little', 'know', 'machinations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'throw', 'contaminated', 'human', 'material', 'dumpsters', 'Rose', 'doing', 'son', 'can', 'afford', 'send', 'appropriate', 'school', 'Norah', 'doing', 'can', 'be', 'close', 'sister', 'perhaps', 'protect', 'what', 'might', 'come', 'trickling', 'back', 'memories', 'mother', 'death.Amongst', 'Oscars', 'birthday', 'desire', 'pair', 'binoculars', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'promised', 'get', 'very', 'expensive', 'pair', 'come', 'up', 'cash', 'quickly', 'leading', 'make', 'financial', 'misstep', 'end', 'up', 'tons', 'rotten', 'seafood', 'here', 'everything', 'head', 'Rose', 'Norah', 'remember', 'mother', 'had', 'bit', 'part', 'small', 'TV', 'production', 'see', 're-run', 'one', 'day', 'respective', 'homes', 'remove', 'knot', 'rope', 'also', 'remember', 'killed', 'family', 'bathtub', 'when', 'Norah', 'father', 'house', 'death', 'coming', 'bathroom', 'memories', 'flood', 'back', 'father', 'bailing', 'dead', 'shrimp', 'tub', 'was', 'quite', 'moment', 'one', 'attention.It', 'intermix', 'relationships', 'how', 'character', 'deals', ""n't"", 'deal', 'film', 'together', 'surprising', 'success', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'vulnerable', 'yet', 'determined', 'woman', 'trying', 'make', 'good', 'son', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'stunning', 'confused', 'embittered', 'sister', 'who', 'smell', 'everything', 'mother', 'left', 'behind', 'deals', 'puzzled', 'relationships', 'Even', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'good', 'job', 'weird', 'kid', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'family', 'going', 'how', 'supposed', 'act.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'good', 'character', 'film', 'not', 'necessarily', 'rousing', 'comedy', 'might', 'try', 'tugging', 'one']",N/A

It stars Amy Adams and Emily Blunt as two sisters, both fairly n'eer-do-well.  Alan Arkin plays their father who has dreams of striking it rich quick with one scheme after another.Amy Adams cleans houses for a living.  Emily Blunt has trouble holding on to any job.  Amy has been having an affair with a police officer whose wife is now pregnant with their second child and she just doesn't get the fact that he is not about to leave his wife for her.  He is helpful in giving her the idea to start a cleaning business that cleans up after crime scenes.  It's good money.  Amy and Emily get into this business and face several challenges that just about ruin their business.Alan Arkin does a fine job as the father.  He has raised his two daughters alone after his wife took her own life when they were very little.  A poignant part of the movie is Emily Blunt's nostalgically remembering her mother and her painful memories of living her life without a mother.  Amy Adams, the big sister, has been responsible for Emily most of their lives.  A new-comer to the stage is the boy who plays Oscar, Amy's son.

Amy Adams is a single-mom trying to make ends meet thru house cleaning work.  Her sister (Emily Blunt) is unemployed and sometimes babysits Adams' young son, who is exceedingly smart but gets into trouble in school.  Their father is Alan Arkin, perfectly cast for this role as the serial, and only mildly succcesful, if at all, entrepreneurial dad who tries to keep the family strong.  On the advice of her married lover, a local cop, Adams and Blunt, the latter reluctantly, go into the lucrative crime-scene clean up business.The movie covers how the sisters deal with the business, each other, their father and their love relationships, but most importantly, how the death of their mother when they were young affects them to this day.  The movie garners sympathy for each major character, recognizing both their strengths and flaws, and making them as such very human and accessible.  Perhaps the only place where the film strays from this realistic portrayal, is when it tries to contrast the working class Adams with her succesful high school classmates at a baby shower she attends.  The classmates are portrayed as totally one-dimensional, caring only about material and superficial things.  Otherwise, the film succeeds in that it makes you feel deeply the emotions that each characters faces, both the most subtle ones as well as the more explcit.",5,Moving and Memorable,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,1491,"['moving', 'engrossing', 'film', 'familial', 'relationships', 'caught', 'web', 'low-income', 'work', 'broken', 'family', 'challenges', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'single-mom', 'trying', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'thru', 'house', 'cleaning', 'work', 'sister', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'unemployed', 'sometimes', 'babysits', 'Adams', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'exceedingly', 'smart', 'trouble', 'school', 'father', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'serial', 'only', 'mildly', 'succcesful', 'entrepreneurial', 'dad', 'who', 'keep', 'family', 'strong', 'advice', 'married', 'lover', 'local', 'cop', 'Adams', 'Blunt', 'latter', 'reluctantly', 'go', 'lucrative', 'crime-scene', 'clean', 'business.The', 'movie', 'how', 'sisters', 'deal', 'business', 'other', 'father', 'love', 'relationships', 'most', 'importantly', 'how', 'death', 'mother', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'affects', 'day', 'movie', 'garners', 'sympathy', 'major', 'character', 'recognizing', 'strengths', 'flaws', 'making', 'such', 'very', 'human', 'accessible', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'film', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'when', 'contrast', 'working', 'class', 'Adams', 'succesful', 'high', 'school', 'classmates', 'baby', 'shower', 'classmates', 'are', 'portrayed', 'totally', 'one-dimensional', 'caring', 'only', 'material', 'superficial', 'things', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'feel', 'deeply', 'emotions', 'characters', 'most', 'subtle', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'explcit']",N/A

Its the first screenplay for writer Megan Holley and she should be utterly proud of her work on this movie, she has given us one of the sweetest films ever, with blood mixed in!Its the story of two sisters, Rose and Nora, and Roses little boy Oscar. Nora lives with their father Joe who is always looking for that next ""big money"" idea he can get his hands on. Rose works as a maid, while Nora is directionless, pausing now and again to baby sit Oscar and fill his head with tales of horror and mental afflictions. The family seems to revolve in different orbits, now and again aligning to alter eachothers lives in a negative way. Rose hears from her cop boyfriend one night while they meet at some seedy hotel, away from the prying eyes of others, about a lucrative business involving crime scene cleanup. He tells her that they make a ""killing"" doing it. Rose considers the job ""disgusting"" and brushes that idea off quickly.Later on, after Rose gets told by Oscars school that he will be put on mandatory medication for his behavioral problems, she yanks him out of there and has to find a way to get him into a private school. That means money, and the idea of becoming a cleaning lady for the dead seems now to be a great idea. I mean there is no bodies right, how hard can it be?She recruits her sister Nora as her partner, Roses cop boyfriend gets her a job using his influence, and they are thrown literally into the thick of it, the thick of blood and guts and noxious smells, liquids, and everything you can imagine that comes with suicide, murder and natural death. How does one clean up a giant blood stain? How do you get bits of brain out of carpet? What do you do with all the splattered materials you accumulate after cleaning? It was so much fun to watch all this happen, I cringed and hid my face, and laughed so hard at these two sisters figure it all out. Enter Winston (played by Clifton Collins Jr), who owns a cleaning supply business, he has one arm and a big heart and Rose has instantly made an impression on him. The sisters soon realize that there is alot more to the blody clean up business than they realize!I havent been caught up in a movie like this in a long time, Rose and Nora might be two opposites but they both let their feelings bubble up to the surface and spill out in ways that made a lump in my throat and gave me a smile on my face. Amy Adams and Emily Blunt give everything to these roles, and I am forever grateful for that. Sunshine Cleaning is about finding the bright side to even the most upsetting and sad situations, finding your purpose in life and realizing you have the ability to make a difference in someones life that you didnt know you had in you, and how family takes care of their own when the world seems hell bent on bringing them down.If you like this movie, If you are fascinated as I am about crime scene cleanup I recommend readingTraumaandAftermath, Inc.: Cleaning Up After CSI Goes HomeandMop Men: Inside the World of Crime Scene Cleaners",5,The Worst of Humanity Brings Out the Best of This Family.,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,3132,"['Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'small', 'cast', 'biggest', 'impact', 'first', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Megan', 'Holley', 'should', 'be', 'utterly', 'proud', 'work', 'movie', 'given', 'one', 'sweetest', 'films', 'ever', 'blood', 'mixed', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'Rose', 'Nora', 'Roses', 'little', 'boy', 'Oscar', 'Nora', 'father', 'Joe', 'who', 'always', 'looking', 'next', 'big', 'money', 'idea', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'Rose', 'maid', 'Nora', 'directionless', 'pausing', 'now', 'again', 'baby', 'sit', 'Oscar', 'fill', 'head', 'tales', 'horror', 'mental', 'afflictions', 'family', 'revolve', 'different', 'orbits', 'now', 'again', 'aligning', 'alter', 'eachothers', 'negative', 'way', 'Rose', 'hears', 'cop', 'boyfriend', 'one', 'night', 'meet', 'seedy', 'hotel', 'away', 'prying', 'eyes', 'others', 'lucrative', 'business', 'involving', 'crime', 'scene', 'cleanup', 'make', 'killing', 'doing', 'Rose', 'considers', 'job', 'disgusting', 'brushes', 'idea', 'off', 'quickly.Later', 'Rose', 'told', 'Oscars', 'school', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'mandatory', 'medication', 'behavioral', 'problems', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'private', 'school', 'money', 'idea', 'becoming', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'dead', 'now', 'be', 'great', 'idea', 'mean', 'bodies', 'right', 'how', 'hard', 'can', 'be', 'sister', 'Nora', 'partner', 'Roses', 'cop', 'boyfriend', 'job', 'using', 'influence', 'are', 'thrown', 'literally', 'thick', 'thick', 'blood', 'guts', 'noxious', 'smells', 'liquids', 'everything', 'can', 'imagine', 'suicide', 'murder', 'natural', 'death', 'How', 'one', 'clean', 'up', 'giant', 'blood', 'stain', 'How', 'do', 'get', 'bits', 'brain', 'carpet', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'splattered', 'materials', 'accumulate', 'cleaning', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'happen', 'cringed', 'hid', 'face', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'two', 'sisters', 'figure', 'out', 'Enter', 'Winston', 'played', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr', 'who', 'cleaning', 'supply', 'business', 'one', 'arm', 'big', 'heart', 'Rose', 'instantly', 'made', 'impression', 'sisters', 'soon', 'realize', 'alot', 'more', 'blody', 'up', 'business', 'realize', 'havent', 'been', 'caught', 'up', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'Rose', 'Nora', 'might', 'be', 'two', 'opposites', 'let', 'feelings', 'bubble', 'up', 'surface', 'spill', 'out', 'ways', 'made', 'lump', 'throat', 'gave', 'smile', 'face', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'give', 'everything', 'roles', 'am', 'forever', 'grateful', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'finding', 'bright', 'side', 'even', 'most', 'upsetting', 'sad', 'situations', 'finding', 'purpose', 'life', 'realizing', 'have', 'ability', 'make', 'difference', 'someones', 'life', 'didnt', 'know', 'had', 'how', 'family', 'care', 'own', 'when', 'world', 'hell', 'bent', 'bringing', 'down.If', 'movie', 'are', 'fascinated', 'am', 'crime', 'scene', 'cleanup', 'recommend', 'readingTraumaandAftermath', 'Inc.', 'Cleaning', 'Up', 'CSI', 'Goes', 'HomeandMop', 'Men', 'World', 'Crime', 'Scene', 'Cleaners']",N/A

A little too high, maybe. I'd seen the producers' first film- Little Miss Sunshine & loved it. Unfortunately I'd expected the same thrills in this movie, especially since Alan Arkin was in it.There's enough reviews on here stating what the movie's plotline is, so I won't waste time describing it in great detail. The movie's premise of a pair of sisters cleaning up crime scenes was an interesting one. Needless to say, it hasn't been done before. I liked that it was unique in several ways & I loved Alan Arkin as the eccentric grandfather. It wasn't that much of a stretch from his role in LMS, but hey- the guy does a great job in those roles.The biggest downfall of the movie is that it tries a little too hard to do too much & there's not a huge amount of resolution seen. It's hinted at, but not actually shown. I just didn't really get into any of the characters for the most part. They just seemed a little one dimensional to me. The minor characters were great & it's not like anyone did a terrible job acting, it's just that there wasn't a lot of depth given to the characters.The film wasn't terrible & I recommend watching it once, but I have to warn people- don't expect a lot from this film.

In fact I expected it to be some kind of artsy chick flick.  This movie is worth a watch for anyone that likes dark indy comedies or strange turn-of-event movies.  Amy Adams is great as the lead in what seems like her most down to earth role I've seen so far.  She is a good actress, but mostly I see her movies as genre redundant - (romantic comedies).  This movie is anything but romantic, in fact it's life-liftingly tragic... if such a thing can be fathomed.The movie mostly centers around Amy Adam's character as she struggle as a single mom.  She is overwhelmed in life by a mentally fragile sister, weird young son, and get-rich-quick scheming father all in tow.  Needless to say her money situation pushes her into the field of cleaning up crime scenes and other bio hazards.  Each character is flawed by their past and throughout the movie you begin to feel them struggle against the inevitable.  But in the end this movie does have a great message, wonderfully vivid characters, quotable one-liners, and lots of awkward moment laughs to break up the drama.

1240428,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001UV4XGU,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Sunshine Cleaning takes a long time to finally settle into a good pace and an interesting story. Once there, the story shines revealing the broken relationships between the characters; and delivers a bittersweet ending.Rose is a house cleaner, who is sleeping with a married police officer. She is also raising her son with the help of her father and sister. Her son has gotten into trouble at school so many times, that she now has to put him in a private school. But the school costs money, which she does not have, so the cheating cop suggests crime scene clean up as a lucrative business. In the meantime, her sister Norah loses her job. Rose and Norah start Sunshine Cleaning, crime scene cleanup.The movie is about relationships, and there in lies some of the difficulty. It takes a very long time to understand the relationship between the two sisters; Rose and her son; the two sisters and their father (although that wasn't exactly very well developed); the grandfather and his grandson; Rose and men in general; Rose and her high school 'friends;' and the people left behind where Sunshine Cleaning is removing the aftermath of a death. Its a moderately complicated mess. Although it does get fairly well tied up in the end.One year apart, Cleaner (Cleaner, Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris), and Sunshine Cleaning on the surface deal with the same topic; cleaning up after a person dies. Cleaner is an intense, analytical, crime movie. Sunshine uses this job as a pretext to explore relationships. Although many have written about and the DVD cover art references, Little Miss Sunshine; these two films are completely unrelated. The producers worked on both movies; and that is a very slim thread. Aside from Alan Arkin being somewhat similar in the two films, and Sunshine is in both titles, these are two entirely different movies.My favorite part of this film is the performances. Emily Blunt (The Great Buck Howard), Amy Adams, Alan Arkin, Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe from 24 - she actually smiles several times in this film), Clifton Collins Jr. all turn in solid performances. Emily (Norah) was just crazy enough without being too far over the top. Amy Adams (Rose) vasilated between cheerleader stupid, sweet happy, sad, innocent, and street smart. Alan Arkin is simply a pleasure to watch as the grandfather. I haven't grown tired of his craziness yet. And Clifton Collins played the caring, understanding, janitorial supply company owner with one arm. Oscar, Rose's son, played by Jason Spavack is one of the highlights of the film. Surprisingly he has a long resume of television and film roles.From a technical standpoint the film was not top notch. The first glaring defect was the first hotel scene with Rose and the Cop. Somehow they managed to find some of the grainiest film stock and then underexposed it by a fair margin. A few other dark scenes had the same problem. And then some of the dailight scenes were underexposed. The camera work was work a day standard melodrama. There was nothing creative or compelling about the framing or camera movements. Pacing was a bit of a problem early in the film dragging on a bit too long. At an hour and a half, it was a bit long by maybe 10 minutes. There was essentially no surround sound used, the film is mostly dialog.The DVD included a single special feature (they used up most of the DVD space by presenting the film in 4:3 and widescreen versions - essentially 4 or 5Gb per version - so there was little room left for special features). The 11 minute interview with two real live crime scene cleaners was interesting. It wasn't really clear if the film is based on these two women, or they just happen to be two women that own this kind of business.The film is rated R for language and suggestive scenes. There is a fair amount of strong language, probably not so appropriate for younger viewers. Amy Adams ends up in her underwear a lot, and is shown in romantic scenes in the hotel. Emily Blunt gets pounded by a guy in his underwear, shows a wonderfully bored expression and answers the phone. But at no point is there any nudity. And there is a scene where Emily Blunt smokes  an 'herbal cigarette.' Maybe not great topics for less than R rated audiences.I liked this film. I wish it had gotten started a bit faster. But then again it is about relationships, and that takes time to develop. I shed a few tears at the end. The film does have a sweet message at the end.",4,"Very Slow Start, Wonderful Finish",1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,4447,"['Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'long', 'time', 'finally', 'settle', 'good', 'pace', 'interesting', 'story', 'Once', 'there', 'story', 'shines', 'revealing', 'broken', 'relationships', 'characters', 'bittersweet', 'ending.Rose', 'house', 'cleaner', 'who', 'sleeping', 'married', 'police', 'officer', 'also', 'raising', 'son', 'help', 'father', 'sister', 'son', 'gotten', 'trouble', 'school', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'now', 'put', 'private', 'school', 'school', 'money', 'not', 'have', 'cheating', 'cop', 'crime', 'scene', 'clean', 'up', 'lucrative', 'business', 'meantime', 'sister', 'Norah', 'job', 'Rose', 'Norah', 'start', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'crime', 'scene', 'cleanup.The', 'movie', 'relationships', 'there', 'difficulty', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'understand', 'relationship', 'two', 'sisters', 'Rose', 'son', 'two', 'sisters', 'father', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'grandfather', 'grandson', 'Rose', 'men', 'general', 'Rose', 'high', 'school', ""'friends"", 'people', 'left', 'where', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'removing', 'aftermath', 'death', 'moderately', 'complicated', 'mess', 'get', 'fairly', 'well', 'tied', 'up', 'end.One', 'year', 'apart', 'Cleaner', 'Cleaner', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'surface', 'deal', 'same', 'topic', 'cleaning', 'up', 'person', 'Cleaner', 'intense', 'analytical', 'crime', 'movie', 'Sunshine', 'job', 'pretext', 'explore', 'relationships', 'many', 'have', 'written', 'DVD', 'cover', 'art', 'references', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'producers', 'worked', 'movies', 'very', 'slim', 'thread', 'Aside', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'being', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'two', 'films', 'Sunshine', 'titles', 'are', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'movies.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'performances', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Great', 'Buck', 'Howard', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'Chloe', '24', 'actually', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'turn', 'solid', 'performances', 'Emily', 'Norah', 'was', 'just', 'crazy', 'enough', 'being', 'too', 'far', 'top', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Rose', 'vasilated', 'cheerleader', 'stupid', 'sweet', 'happy', 'sad', 'innocent', 'street', 'smart', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'simply', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'grandfather', 'have', ""n't"", 'grown', 'tired', 'craziness', 'yet', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'played', 'caring', 'understanding', 'janitorial', 'supply', 'company', 'owner', 'one', 'arm', 'Oscar', 'Rose', 'son', 'played', 'Jason', 'Spavack', 'one', 'highlights', 'film', 'Surprisingly', 'long', 'resume', 'television', 'film', 'roles.From', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'top', 'notch', 'first', 'glaring', 'defect', 'was', 'first', 'hotel', 'scene', 'Rose', 'Cop', 'Somehow', 'managed', 'find', 'grainiest', 'film', 'stock', 'then', 'underexposed', 'fair', 'margin', 'few', 'other', 'dark', 'scenes', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'then', 'dailight', 'scenes', 'were', 'underexposed', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'work', 'day', 'standard', 'melodrama', 'was', 'nothing', 'creative', 'compelling', 'framing', 'camera', 'movements', 'Pacing', 'was', 'bit', 'problem', 'early', 'film', 'dragging', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'hour', 'half', 'was', 'bit', 'long', 'maybe', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'essentially', 'surround', 'sound', 'used', 'film', 'mostly', 'dialog.The', 'DVD', 'included', 'single', 'special', 'feature', 'used', 'up', 'most', 'DVD', 'space', 'presenting', 'film', '4:3', 'widescreen', 'versions', 'essentially', '4', '5Gb', 'version', 'so', 'was', 'little', 'room', 'left', 'special', 'features', '11', 'minute', 'interview', 'two', 'real', 'live', 'crime', 'scene', 'cleaners', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'clear', 'film', 'based', 'two', 'women', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'two', 'women', 'own', 'kind', 'business.The', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'suggestive', 'scenes', 'fair', 'amount', 'strong', 'language', 'probably', 'not', 'so', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'up', 'underwear', 'lot', 'shown', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'hotel', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'pounded', 'guy', 'underwear', 'wonderfully', 'bored', 'expression', 'phone', 'point', 'nudity', 'scene', 'where', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'smokes', ""'herbal"", 'cigarette', 'Maybe', 'not', 'great', 'topics', 'less', 'R', 'rated', 'audiences.I', 'liked', 'film', 'wish', 'had', 'gotten', 'started', 'bit', 'faster', 'then', 'again', 'relationships', 'time', 'develop', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'sweet', 'message', 'end']",N/A

So ""Sunshine Cleaning"" seems like a pretty good option -- it's a rather sweet, dryly-humorous movie about a family who is just trying to get by. The premise is a little hard to swallow, but the actors mostly make up for it with their strong performances and likable characters.Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams) and her sister Norah (Emily Blunt) have pretty unsatisfactory lives -- one is a maid, and the other just got fired from her waitressing job and is living with her dad. When Rose's son is casually expelled from school, she faces either having to give him medication or send him to a private school -- and she can't afford either.With the help of Rose's married boyfriend, she manages to get a job in biohazard cleanup. Yes, I said ""biohazard cleanup.""Though their business is initially just a way to get money, Norah and Rose quickly try to turn Sunshine Cleaning into a legitimate business, and begin to learn how they can help other people as they work. But when disaster strikes, everything they've tried to do may go up in incinerator smoke... literally.""Sunshine Cleaning"" is one of those movies with just the right amount of quirk (talking deer head?) and heart. It's got kind of a ridiculous premise, since I'm pretty sure you need some kind of training and/or licensing to handle biohazardous materials. But I'm willing to suspend my disbelief.Honestly, what makes this work is the story of the family -- the sisters learning to grow closer as they also learn to understand each other, and the elderly grandfather growing closer to his troubled grandson. The dialogue sounds fairly natural, but still rather funny (""I mean, because people don't realize the safety risks involved with the removal of... blood and body fluids"").It also has a nice message about our vile school system, which prefers to medicate and/or abandon children who don't turn into nice average little drones.But it really rests on the trinity of Amy Adams, Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin.

While her insufferable character in Nora Ephron'sJulie & Juliadoesn't allow her much latitude to showcase her talents, she gets a better opportunity to provide depth and complexity to this low-budget 2009 indie drama as Rose Lorkowski, a thirty-something single mother, a former high school cheerleader who has been relegated to cleaning houses to support her hyperactive eight-year-old son Oscar. Directed by Christine Jeffs (whose previous credit is the depressing Sylvia Plath biopic,Sylvia, starring Gwyneth Paltrow) and written by first-time screenwriter Megan Holley, the film maintains a casual pace and a modest tone considering the oddball plot developments that drive the surprisingly cohesive narrative.The primary story focuses on the unfulfilled potential in Rose's meager life and how challenged she is to act upon it. Filled with comically nightmarish visions thanks to inventive horror stories from Rose's embittered slacker sister Norah, Oscar becomes enough of a problem at school that he needs to be moved to a private school. In need of cash for the tuition, Rose decides to take the advice of her married lover Mac (of course, the former star quarterback in high school and now a police officer) and becomes a specialist in cleaning up after bloody crime scenes. It also gives Rose an opportunity to partner with Norah, who begrudgingly agrees to participate in the often stomach-turning venture. For a brief time, they become successful in this unsavory niche, but the situation is complicated by their joint personal history triggered by their mother's suicide when they were children.Beyond Adams' fine work, Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) proves her versatility playing Norah as a nihilist hiding a pained, inarticulate memory of her mother. Alan Arkin is on familiar territory as Rose and Norah's father, an unquenchable salesman ready for the next get-rich-quick scheme. His comic scenes with Jason Spevack, who plays Oscar, will remind you of very similar scenes with Abigail Breslin inLittle Miss Sunshine. Gradually moving away from his standard doofus roles, Steve Zahn plays Mac pretty cleanly as an adulterer who can't get over Rose despite the imminent arrival of a second child. There are more interesting turns from Mary Lynn Rajskub (24) as a spooked blood bank worker stalked by Norah, as well as Clifton Collins Jr. (Capote) as a plainspoken cleaning supply specialist. The extras on the 2009 DVD include a commentary track from and producer Glenn Williamson (though surprisingly neither Jeffs nor any of the principal actors participate), and an intriguing featurette about the business of biohazard cleaning.",4,"Acute, Quirky Look at the Unfulfilled Potential of Two Sisters",1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,2824,"['Amy', 'Adams', 'actress', 'easy', 'underestimate', 'due', 'naturally', 'sunny', 'disposition', 'time', 'again', 'emotional', 'dexterity', 'economic', 'impactful', 'insufferable', 'character', 'Nora', ""Ephron'sJulie"", 'Juliadoes', ""n't"", 'allow', 'much', 'latitude', 'showcase', 'talents', 'better', 'opportunity', 'provide', 'depth', 'complexity', 'low-budget', '2009', 'indie', 'drama', 'Rose', 'Lorkowski', 'thirty-something', 'single', 'mother', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'been', 'relegated', 'cleaning', 'houses', 'support', 'hyperactive', 'eight-year-old', 'son', 'Oscar', 'Directed', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'previous', 'credit', 'depressing', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'biopic', 'Sylvia', 'starring', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'written', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Megan', 'Holley', 'film', 'casual', 'pace', 'modest', 'tone', 'considering', 'oddball', 'plot', 'developments', 'drive', 'surprisingly', 'cohesive', 'narrative.The', 'primary', 'story', 'unfulfilled', 'potential', 'Rose', 'meager', 'life', 'how', 'challenged', 'act', 'Filled', 'comically', 'nightmarish', 'visions', 'thanks', 'inventive', 'horror', 'stories', 'Rose', 'embittered', 'slacker', 'sister', 'Norah', 'Oscar', 'enough', 'problem', 'school', 'be', 'moved', 'private', 'school', 'need', 'cash', 'tuition', 'Rose', 'take', 'advice', 'married', 'lover', 'Mac', 'course', 'former', 'star', 'quarterback', 'high', 'school', 'now', 'police', 'officer', 'specialist', 'cleaning', 'up', 'bloody', 'crime', 'scenes', 'also', 'Rose', 'opportunity', 'partner', 'Norah', 'who', 'begrudgingly', 'participate', 'often', 'stomach-turning', 'venture', 'brief', 'time', 'become', 'successful', 'unsavory', 'niche', 'situation', 'complicated', 'joint', 'personal', 'history', 'triggered', 'mother', 'suicide', 'when', 'were', 'children.Beyond', 'Adams', 'fine', 'work', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'versatility', 'playing', 'Norah', 'nihilist', 'hiding', 'pained', 'inarticulate', 'memory', 'mother', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'familiar', 'territory', 'Rose', 'Norah', 'father', 'unquenchable', 'salesman', 'ready', 'next', 'get-rich-quick', 'scheme', 'comic', 'scenes', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'who', 'Oscar', 'will', 'remind', 'very', 'similar', 'scenes', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'inLittle', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Gradually', 'moving', 'away', 'standard', 'doofus', 'roles', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Mac', 'pretty', 'cleanly', 'adulterer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'over', 'Rose', 'imminent', 'arrival', 'second', 'child', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'turns', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', '24', 'spooked', 'blood', 'bank', 'worker', 'stalked', 'Norah', 'as', 'well', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Capote', 'plainspoken', 'cleaning', 'supply', 'specialist', 'extras', '2009', 'DVD', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'producer', 'Glenn', 'Williamson', 'surprisingly', 'Jeffs', 'principal', 'actors', 'participate', 'intriguing', 'featurette', 'business', 'biohazard', 'cleaning']",N/A

And their father, who is always trying to scheme to make a quick buck.at times funny, other times sad, other times melancholy...it is a realistic movie about a financially struggling family trying to stay together in difficult times.",3,"Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, Alan Arkin shine in ""Sunshine""",1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,762,"['what', 'would', 'call', 'character', 'piece', 'movie', 'normally', 'movie', 'will', 'focus', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'get', 'three', 'characters', 'two', 'sisters', 'father', 'interactions', 'plot', 'interesting', 'found', 'acting', 'interactions', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'fun.essentially', 'struggles', 'family-', 'unwed', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'trying', 'work', 'care', 'child', 'same', 'time', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'bit', 'slacker', ""n't"", 'have', 'goals', 'life', 'father', 'who', 'always', 'trying', 'scheme', 'make', 'quick', 'buck.at', 'times', 'funny', 'other', 'times', 'sad', 'other', 'times', 'melancholy', 'realistic', 'movie', 'financially', 'struggling', 'family', 'trying', 'stay', 'together', 'difficult', 'times']",N/A
1240452,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B001UV4XGU,James Hiller,"[0, 0]","Undoubtably, this film will wrangle comparisons to another little film a few years back,Little Miss Sunshine, moreso than the same word in the title, shared producers, settings, and the remarkable Alan Arkin. Both are famiy centered dramas, of dyfunction and ultimate family unity, that allows their characters to be flawed, and real, and heartbroken from time to time. However, while Little Miss Sunshine cheered and made us laugh, this movie misses the mark, ever so slightly, despite the fine work of a cast of greats.Inspired by a story heard on NPR about crime scene clean up artists, Sunshine Cleaning is the story of self-doubting Rose (Amy Adams) and  her directionless sister Norah (Emily Blunt), who grapple with some mysteries in their lives while trying to find themselves. Rose is a house cleaner, a onetime former beauty, A list high schooler, who finds herself a maid in a former classmates house. Reminded of her lowly status, and dealing with an out of control child who needs a private school, Rose creates a lucrative business when her occasional married fling Matt (when did Steve Zahn grow up and look so good?) sets her up on her first ""discounted"" cleanup. Needing help, she pulls Norah into the mix, and together, they form ""Sunshine Cleaning"".The crime scenes end up being much more complex, complicated, and gory than they may have first imagined, but determined to succeed, the two grow into their roles, and thereby, growing into their lives and relationships. While Adams and Blunt act the heck out of their scenes, there still is a quiet disappointment that permeates the script, of which, I cannot quite pinpoint. Perhaps the scene with a CB radio in their cleaning van that sends words up into heaven? Perhaps the quizzical plot line involving a photo Norah finds at a crime scene and an ensuring, yet ultimately pointless, relationship with a woman? It was hard to find.Certainly enjoyable, if only for the acting, Sunshine Cleaning is a modest film, with modest intentions, all leading to modest results.",3,"Quiet Film, Stellar Cast",1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,2038,"['Undoubtably', 'film', 'will', 'wrangle', 'comparisons', 'little', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'moreso', 'same', 'word', 'title', 'shared', 'producers', 'settings', 'remarkable', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'are', 'famiy', 'centered', 'dramas', 'dyfunction', 'ultimate', 'family', 'unity', 'characters', 'be', 'flawed', 'real', 'heartbroken', 'time', 'time', 'However', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'cheered', 'made', 'laugh', 'movie', 'mark', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'fine', 'work', 'cast', 'greats.Inspired', 'story', 'heard', 'NPR', 'crime', 'scene', 'clean', 'up', 'artists', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'story', 'self-doubting', 'Rose', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'directionless', 'sister', 'Norah', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'who', 'grapple', 'mysteries', 'lives', 'trying', 'find', 'Rose', 'house', 'cleaner', 'onetime', 'former', 'beauty', 'A', 'list', 'high', 'schooler', 'who', 'maid', 'former', 'classmates', 'house', 'Reminded', 'lowly', 'status', 'dealing', 'control', 'child', 'who', 'private', 'school', 'Rose', 'lucrative', 'business', 'when', 'occasional', 'married', 'fling', 'Matt', 'when', 'did', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'grow', 'up', 'look', 'so', 'good', 'up', 'first', 'discounted', 'cleanup', 'Needing', 'help', 'Norah', 'mix', 'together', 'form', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', '.The', 'crime', 'scenes', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'complicated', 'gory', 'may', 'have', 'first', 'imagined', 'determined', 'succeed', 'two', 'grow', 'roles', 'thereby', 'growing', 'lives', 'relationships', 'Adams', 'Blunt', 'act', 'heck', 'scenes', 'still', 'quiet', 'disappointment', 'script', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'pinpoint', 'Perhaps', 'scene', 'CB', 'radio', 'cleaning', 'van', 'words', 'up', 'heaven', 'Perhaps', 'quizzical', 'plot', 'line', 'involving', 'photo', 'Norah', 'crime', 'scene', 'ensuring', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'pointless', 'relationship', 'woman', 'was', 'hard', 'find.Certainly', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'acting', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'modest', 'film', 'modest', 'intentions', 'leading', 'modest', 'results']",N/A

With both ladies primarily sticking to somewhat comedic roles (Okay, Amy Adams wasn't funny in Doubt), it was a pleasure watching them apply their levity-invoking talents to a somewhat more dramatic tale.Though there exist many familiar plot elements in this film (family divisions, marital/relationship issues, search for excepting one's fate) the package deal was filled with memorable elements -- none more so than the premise of starting a crime scene cleaning business.I was thoroughly pleased with all performances delivered in this film from Alan Arkin as the slightly off-kiltered dad/granddad to Emily Blunt's dryly (in a good way) delivered role as the dead beat and somewhat tortured younger sister to that of Jason Spevack as the imaginative and impressionable (oh, Lobsterman!) young Oscar.While I wouldn't really call this a chick flick (though the stars are likely to draw on an audience that has enjoyed them in a number of 'chick' films), I would call it a solidly entertaining look at the lengths some people will go to 'make it' with the cards dealt them.All around pleasing film.",4,Delivers excellent performances in a refreshing story package (a new trend in 'chick' flicks??),1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,1194,"['two', 'lead', 'actresses', 'movie', 'are', 'ladies', ""'ve"", 'been', 'enjoying', 'run', 'recent', 'films', 'ladies', 'primarily', 'sticking', 'somewhat', 'comedic', 'roles', 'Okay', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Doubt', 'was', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'apply', 'levity-invoking', 'talents', 'somewhat', 'more', 'dramatic', 'exist', 'many', 'familiar', 'plot', 'elements', 'film', 'family', 'divisions', 'marital/relationship', 'issues', 'search', 'excepting', 'one', 'fate', 'package', 'deal', 'was', 'filled', 'memorable', 'elements', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'premise', 'starting', 'crime', 'scene', 'cleaning', 'business.I', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'pleased', 'performances', 'delivered', 'film', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'slightly', 'off-kiltered', 'dad/granddad', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'dryly', 'good', 'way', 'delivered', 'role', 'dead', 'beat', 'somewhat', 'tortured', 'younger', 'sister', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'imaginative', 'impressionable', 'oh', 'Lobsterman', 'young', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'chick', 'flick', 'stars', 'are', 'likely', 'draw', 'audience', 'enjoyed', 'number', ""'chick"", 'films', 'would', 'call', 'solidly', 'entertaining', 'look', 'lengths', 'people', 'will', 'go', ""'make"", 'cards', 'dealt', 'them.All', 'pleasing', 'film']",N/A

Wilkerson,"[4, 4]","When Rose (Amy Adams) needs to make money to put her son Oscar (Jason Spevack) into a private school when he keeps getting in trouble at his regular school, she turns to her unreliable sister Norah (Emily Blunt) to help her start a bio-hazard removal/ cleaning business. Even knowing that part of their job is to clean up after dead bodies, they still don't anticipate the job being as difficult as it is. From Norah trying to find the daughter of a suicide to Rose dealing with the personal issues of being a single mom and having an affair with a married cop, the sisters deal with life and a job that's out of the ordinary.Christine Jeffs (Sylvia) and first time screenwriter Megan Holley came up with the idea for Sunshine Cleaning from the story of two women from Seattle they heard on a National Public Radio ""All Things Considered"" segment. In real life the women are actually best friends who own a biohazard removal/ cleaning service, but naturally with all adaptations things are changed to better move along the story, or to help the audience to identify with the plight of the main characters.By choosing a pair of regular women to go into a job of this nature, the filmmakers have done a great job of making a movie that has a hint of originality. Also, by choosing a profession of this nature, the movie is also able to deal with elements of life and death, moving on and dealing with the darkness in our past. The movie effectively communicates it's messages while never being overbearing in it's way of dealing with them.The acting in this movie is great as would be expected from this cast of characters. Twice Oscar nominated Amy Adams (Junebug, Doubt) does a great job as the more stable sister who can't let go of her past. Oscar winner Alan Arkin (Little Miss Sunshine) returns to familiar territory as the patriarch who is always trying new business ventures to try and help his family out, internally showing signs of inadequacy having raised his daughters as a single father. The real winner in the cast is the up and coming Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada, The Young Victoria) as the unstable daughter who can't get over elements of her past that seemingly tear at the fabric of her being.I really liked Sunshine Cleaning, but I kept getting the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to exert their independence in this indie film by being a lot like other films. Don't get me wrong, homages are the highest form of flattery and some of my favorite filmmakers make great living by making full films based on homages. The problem comes when watching the entire film makes you think of one film in particular in structure and in characterizations. Also following the indie model means that the characters often times have quirks that don't really further the characterization, but are just there to exert the filmmaker's passion to be non-mainstream.I do highly recommend the movie, and intend to add the film to my collection. I will admit that the indie-isms have a tendency to frustrate me at times, but that doesn't mean that you'll feel the same way when you watch this film. If you like movies like Little Miss Sunshine, you'll enjoy this movie.4/5",4,Sunshine Cleaning,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,3182,"['When', 'Rose', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'make', 'money', 'put', 'son', 'Oscar', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'private', 'school', 'when', 'getting', 'trouble', 'regular', 'school', 'unreliable', 'sister', 'Norah', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'help', 'start', 'bio-hazard', 'removal/', 'cleaning', 'business', 'Even', 'knowing', 'part', 'job', 'clean', 'up', 'dead', 'bodies', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'job', 'being', 'as', 'difficult', 'Norah', 'trying', 'find', 'daughter', 'suicide', 'Rose', 'dealing', 'personal', 'issues', 'being', 'single', 'mom', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'cop', 'sisters', 'deal', 'life', 'job', 'ordinary.Christine', 'Jeffs', 'Sylvia', 'first', 'time', 'screenwriter', 'Megan', 'Holley', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'story', 'two', 'women', 'Seattle', 'heard', 'National', 'Public', 'Radio', 'All', 'Things', 'Considered', 'segment', 'real', 'life', 'women', 'are', 'actually', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'own', 'biohazard', 'removal/', 'cleaning', 'service', 'naturally', 'adaptations', 'things', 'are', 'changed', 'better', 'move', 'story', 'help', 'audience', 'identify', 'plight', 'main', 'characters.By', 'choosing', 'pair', 'regular', 'women', 'go', 'job', 'nature', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'movie', 'hint', 'originality', 'Also', 'choosing', 'profession', 'nature', 'movie', 'also', 'able', 'deal', 'elements', 'life', 'death', 'moving', 'dealing', 'darkness', 'past', 'movie', 'effectively', 'messages', 'never', 'being', 'overbearing', 'way', 'dealing', 'them.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'great', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'cast', 'characters', 'Twice', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Junebug', 'Doubt', 'great', 'job', 'more', 'stable', 'sister', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'past', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'familiar', 'territory', 'patriarch', 'who', 'always', 'trying', 'new', 'business', 'ventures', 'try', 'help', 'family', 'out', 'internally', 'showing', 'signs', 'inadequacy', 'having', 'raised', 'daughters', 'single', 'father', 'real', 'winner', 'cast', 'up', 'coming', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Young', 'Victoria', 'unstable', 'daughter', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'elements', 'past', 'seemingly', 'tear', 'fabric', 'being.I', 'really', 'liked', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'kept', 'getting', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'exert', 'independence', 'indie', 'film', 'being', 'lot', 'other', 'films', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'homages', 'are', 'highest', 'form', 'flattery', 'favorite', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'great', 'living', 'making', 'full', 'films', 'based', 'homages', 'problem', 'when', 'watching', 'entire', 'film', 'think', 'one', 'film', 'particular', 'structure', 'characterizations', 'Also', 'following', 'indie', 'model', 'characters', 'often', 'times', 'have', 'quirks', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'further', 'characterization', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'exert', 'filmmaker', 'passion', 'be', 'non-mainstream.I', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'intend', 'add', 'film', 'collection', 'will', 'admit', 'indie-isms', 'have', 'tendency', 'frustrate', 'times', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'like', 'movies', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie.4/5']",N/A
1240455,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B001UV4XGU,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 0]","A family is torn apart by the tragic death of one of its members.  Meet the Lorkowskis of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Joe, the father, is an annoying salesman who markets everything from candy to shrimp; his big money making schemes always go awry.  The eldest daughter Rose was a popular cheerleader in high school who now cleans the homes of her wealthy classmates; she has been having a long-term affair with her high school sweetheart, Mac, who decided to marry someone else.  A single mom, Rose struggles to raise her son, Oscar, who is being kicked out of public school for disruptive behavior.  Her sister Norah has a wandering spirit and has just lost another job.  Desperate for money, Rose asks her sister to join her in Sunshine Cleaning - a biohazard removal and crime scene cleanup operation.  Initially, the girls don't know what they are doing and there are hilarious consequences.  Eventually, after much experience, they learn the proper protective clothing to wear and they turn Sunshine Cleaning into a lucrative, emotionally satisfying business.  Rose and Norah learn how to deal compassionately with those who have experienced the deaths of loved ones and to heal their own wounds.  Despite the death of a loved one, we must make the most of our own lives.Death is a part of life.  Everyone must deal with it at some point in their life.  The most tragic deaths are those that come unexpected, such as a suicide.  Because of many questions that can never be answered, family members may feel bitterness and anger towards God and the one who died.  ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is a very emotional, very provocative look at tragic death and how people learn to cope with it.  Not only death, but life-altering accidents as well.  One of my favorite characters is Winston who lost his arm in a motorcycle accident.  However, he continues to be a happy, productive member of society; he hasn't allowed his handicap to discourage him.  On the contrary, he offers encouragement, comfort and advice to Rose as she struggles with her foundling business and raising Oscar.  Also, Winston enjoys gluing together the pieces of models.  Indeed, ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is rich with symbolism and characters, most of which you will like despite their human flaws.  I grew to admire and respect the Lorkowski family for fighting to stay together and make Sunshine Cleaning a success.  I enjoyed watching Rose's character change from being emotionally dependant on her boyfriend, Mac, to becoming more self reliant.  It was surprising to learn that Norah wasn't the selfish wildcat that I originally thought but was actually quite compassionate and sensitive, albeit a little clumsy.  The Lorkowskis will make you laugh with their foibles.A top notch cast of stars can be found in ""Sunshine Cleaning.""  Everyone's acting was superb.  Amy Adams (Rose) and Emily Blunt (Norah) looked and acted remarkably like sisters.  Blunt is one of the reasons I so badly wanted to watch this film.  This gorgeous young woman is awesome at portraying a variety of different characters.  I liked her as the snooty office assistant in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and as the frightened college student in ""Wind Chill.""  In ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" Blunt has this rough, wild exterior but a soft, gentle heart that is burdened with raging, pent up emotions and unanswered questions.  The actors who ""stole the show"" were the adorable child actor Jason Spevack as Oscar and the likeable Clifton Collins Jr. as Winston.  It was a treat to watch Robert Redford's daughter, Amy Redford, in a cameo as Mac's wife Heather.  The scene where she tells Rose she knows about the affair is one of the best in the film.""Sunshine Cleaning"" is just one in a series of many emotional, poignant films that Anchor Bay Entertainment has recently released.  They have provided trailers for several others including:  ""Last Chance Harvey,"" ""Henry Poole Is Here,"" ""The Visitor"" and ""Sleepwalking.""  There is also a trailer for the comedy ""Table for Three.""  Excellent documentary is provided by producer Glenn Williamson (""Little Miss Sunshine"") and script writer Megan Holley.  The people of Albuquerque must be extremely friendly for allowing the film crew to shoot most of the scenes inside and outside actual locales.  The sporting goods store, the elementary school, the candy store and the blood bank were just a few.  I was thrilled to learn that the actor portraying Winston actually has two arms.  It was either tucked behind his back during shooting or digitally removed during the editing process.  One of my favorite features is ""A Fresh Look at a Dirty Business.""  It consists primarily of an interview with two wonderful women who are actually in the business of biohazard removal and crime scene cleanup.  It was very educational in that they described the type of equipment used for maintaining proper safety and hygiene.  Also, they spoke about the emotional comfort they provided to the relatives of the deceased.  I never realized how rewarding this business could be.  During some of the scenes, I became teary eyed while thinking about what the victims' families had suffered and how these women had entered into their lives to help and console them so that the last memories they had of their loved ones were not tarnished and ugly ones.If you enjoy emotional, family drama, then you must watch ""Sunshine Cleaning.""  It offers the viewer a rainbow of hope that life is worth living no matter how difficult it may seem.Joseph B.

1240456,A2H4AWIOK1REMX,B001UV4XGU,"J. C Clark ""eanna""","[20, 21]","I cannot understand those who were bored by this film. I was entranced; good performances all around married to a well-developed plot with skillful writing yielded a totally satisfying experience. As one who did not much care for ""Little Miss Sunshine"", I was certainly not hoping for a repeat. And did not get it.The guy at my Blockbuster store said ""Oh, good movie. My wife and I watched it three times; we really liked it,"" when we checked it out. Three times may be a bit much, but it held us. The subplots that go nowhere (the blood bank gal, the problems in school) were, to me, perfect expressions of the fits and starts that life endlessly presents. Not everything gets tidied up; not everyone sees our attempted generosity as we do; not all stories have a satisfactory conclusion. Sometimes people are jerks, bad things happen, and we get stuck. One other pleasure was that the two people who seem to be experiencing the first sparks of interest do not hook up. How nice for a story to allow two lonely people to stay lonely, at least for now.The other thing I truly liked about this film is that everywhere else Hollywood despises low paid labor and those who perform it. (In the movies that is; in real life, where stars are lining up defending illegal immigration so their lawns, pools, and bathrooms can be cared for at bargain rates, things are different.) But a maid and a small shop owner are treated respectfully. These are hard-working people trying, not terribly successfully, to make a go of things, and the film never laughs at them or insults them or condescends to them. Thank you.And it wonderfully destroys some idiotic fantasies. Suicide is not glamorous and poetic, not heroic or brave; it is the ultimate act of self. You can not claim to love people when you splatter your brains across their floor and allow them to clean up the mess. That is absolute selfishness. It is not love. Love means working hard to help people, giving up something of value. Love is not motel sex. It is not sex at all; it can, and often is, the exact opposite.

Going in, I was only a semi fan of the much overrated ""Little Miss Sunshine"", but I think ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is 100% better. It struck a chord with me on many levels, and it's layered with subtle and dry, but witty humor (which, at times, is hysterical - much like life); and I really empathized with each character's personal dispositions.I'm fond of Amy Adams & Emily Blunt & thought they were wonderfully cast in their respective roles. Alan Arkin was good playing what he usually plays: the aloof  but caring father figure we've grown accustom to seeing him play (""Little Miss Sunshine"" & ""The Slums of Beverly Hills"" - another great & underrated film).At times, this is a tender story of a misguided, albeit, typical American family trying to find a balance to fit into life; which is usually cookie cutter, overbearing and way too pretentious (in the words of Norah's character: ""I think you may have oversold it"")...I also liked the subtle commentary on how schools are so ready and prepared to discard kids and put them in special ed and on medications rather than dealing with them as unique individuals in a realistic way.I was also impressed with Rose's bold move to get up & walk out during the baby shower.I came away really loving this movie for what it is.

1240461,A1ZPY91VE3IDN1,B001UV4XGU,JO,"[0, 0]","Megan Holley's script, 'Sunshine Cleaning' won the Virginia Film Festival which was judged by alum Glenn Williamson who then produced this film. It was written during the 'CSI' upward movement, laden with blood and guts, shortly followed by forensic anthropology and forensic science entering the television race. Timing was perfect and in 2005, according to Variety, Ashley Judd and Zooey Deschanel (sister of Emily who plays Dr. Temperance Brennan on Fox's 'Bones') were scheduled to star. I don't know why, but fortunately Amy Adams and Emily Blunt instead starred in the movie, accompanied by a terrific and relatively inexperienced young man named Jason Spevack and a very experienced and respected Alan Arkin. Steve Zahn plays the two-timing husband of Heather and lover of Rose. Guess he likes his flowers in beds like many gardeners. The story appeals to me on several levels and the film was shot and edited exceptionally well. The DVD was produced well with a few audio spots that were overmodulated, but it is otherwise unremarkable technically. The menu is easy to understand and navigate and the extras include a very interesting segment on two women who operate a business very similar to the one portrayed in the movie. These two women, however, are scientifically trained as opposed to Holley's two characters who fall into this business via desperation and the suggestion by policeman Mac (Zahn). I recommend watching this little extra after viewing the film. On the other hand, I didn't watch the entire film with the writer and producer's commentary because I became bored with the dominating Williamson. It was a disappointment and I cannot recommend this extra. As for the story line, we have two sisters, one has a ""gifted and highly intelligent"" 8 year old son who is perpetually in trouble, a quirky enterprising father, a departed mother who took her own life and left the adolescent girls with indelible memories, a kind one armed man who's character was the weakest link in this chain, the pained daughter of one of their earliest cases and the benign high school football star who has more influence than he should. The Lorkowski family celebrates life while removing residuals from the physical endings of life, each time grabbing a piece of hope for their own futures and explanation for their pasts.  Music was very well put together, with my particular favorite being Norman Greenbaum's Spirit in the Sky.  For a closing, it tied together the threads of this story into a nice package, that being whatever is beyond our life is the culmination of what we've left behind.  The remainders of our existence may be removed, some times piece by piece, but our 'spirits' exist beyond the physical, regardless of whether or not we believe in anything beyond physical life.  Should we choose to believe, then we can gain hope or security by that notion.  We may pray or we may talk through a CB radio, whatever gets us through the night.  I recommend this movie and DVD. I think this is a sweet movie that entertained me for 91 minutes and I will watch it again without listening to the audio commentary. As a little aside, Heather is played by Amy Redford who directed a disappointing independent feature of her own.",4,VA Film Festival Script Winner Succeeds w/ Sunshine Cleaning,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,3241,"['Megan', 'Holley', 'script', ""'Sunshine"", 'Cleaning', 'won', 'Virginia', 'Film', 'Festival', 'was', 'judged', 'alum', 'Glenn', 'Williamson', 'who', 'then', 'produced', 'film', 'was', 'written', ""'CSI"", 'upward', 'movement', 'laden', 'blood', 'guts', 'shortly', 'followed', 'forensic', 'anthropology', 'forensic', 'science', 'entering', 'television', 'race', 'Timing', 'was', 'perfect', '2005', 'according', 'Variety', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'sister', 'Emily', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Temperance', 'Brennan', 'Fox', ""'Bones"", 'were', 'scheduled', 'star', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'fortunately', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'instead', 'starred', 'movie', 'accompanied', 'terrific', 'relatively', 'inexperienced', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'very', 'experienced', 'respected', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'two-timing', 'husband', 'Heather', 'lover', 'Rose', 'Guess', 'flowers', 'beds', 'many', 'gardeners', 'story', 'appeals', 'several', 'levels', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'edited', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'DVD', 'was', 'produced', 'well', 'few', 'audio', 'spots', 'were', 'overmodulated', 'otherwise', 'unremarkable', 'technically', 'menu', 'easy', 'understand', 'navigate', 'extras', 'include', 'very', 'interesting', 'segment', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'operate', 'business', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'two', 'women', 'however', 'are', 'scientifically', 'trained', 'opposed', 'Holley', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'fall', 'business', 'desperation', 'suggestion', 'policeman', 'Mac', 'Zahn', 'recommend', 'watching', 'little', 'extra', 'viewing', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'entire', 'film', 'writer', 'producer', 'commentary', 'became', 'bored', 'dominating', 'Williamson', 'was', 'disappointment', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'extra', 'story', 'line', 'have', 'two', 'sisters', 'one', 'gifted', 'highly', 'intelligent', '8', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'perpetually', 'trouble', 'quirky', 'enterprising', 'father', 'departed', 'mother', 'who', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'left', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'indelible', 'memories', 'kind', 'one', 'armed', 'man', 'who', 'character', 'was', 'weakest', 'link', 'chain', 'pained', 'daughter', 'one', 'earliest', 'cases', 'benign', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'star', 'who', 'more', 'influence', 'should', 'Lorkowski', 'family', 'life', 'removing', 'residuals', 'physical', 'endings', 'life', 'time', 'grabbing', 'piece', 'hope', 'own', 'futures', 'explanation', 'pasts', 'Music', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'particular', 'favorite', 'being', 'Norman', 'Greenbaum', 'Spirit', 'Sky', 'closing', 'tied', 'together', 'threads', 'story', 'nice', 'package', 'being', 'life', 'culmination', 'what', ""'ve"", 'left', 'behind', 'remainders', 'existence', 'may', 'be', 'removed', 'times', 'piece', 'piece', ""'spirits"", 'exist', 'physical', 'regardless', 'not', 'believe', 'anything', 'physical', 'life', 'Should', 'choose', 'believe', 'then', 'can', 'gain', 'hope', 'security', 'notion', 'may', 'pray', 'may', 'talk', 'CB', 'radio', 'night', 'recommend', 'movie', 'DVD', 'think', 'sweet', 'movie', 'entertained', '91', 'minutes', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'listening', 'audio', 'commentary', 'little', 'aside', 'Heather', 'played', 'Amy', 'Redford', 'who', 'directed', 'disappointing', 'independent', 'feature', 'own']",N/A

This movie takes you along as an ambitious but uneducated single mom (Adams) attempts to improve her life by starting her own biohazard clean-up business.  Your heart reaches out to her, and you desperately hope for her to succeed as the obstacles continue to mount up.  The characters centered around Adams are realistic and totally believable for their socioeconomic standing - from the unmotivated lost soul sister, to the get rich quick/scam artist father, all the way to her emotionally troubled, poor performing son.  The only character clearly out of place is Adams - here is a well spoken, kind hearted, white, professionally sweet, hard working, fast learning, physically fit, stunningly beautiful, mid-twenties women who can only find gainful employment through cleaning houses ... this doesn't make any sense, and is clearly at odds with the typical stereotype.  This movie is both hopefully motivating and depressingly sad at the same time.  Production quality is good; and on location filming in Albuquerque, NM (an ever increasingly popular trend in the moving making industry) is well done.  The writing is crisp and inviting.  Directing is also good, and the cast does an outstanding job of making their somewhat unbelievable lives real and empathetic (especially Adams - who has the biggest challenge for making a totally unbelievable character real).",4,Sunshine Cleaning - I Enjoyed It,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,1473,"['Nobody', 'hopeful', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'better', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'again', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'movie', 'along', 'ambitious', 'uneducated', 'single', 'mom', 'Adams', 'improve', 'life', 'starting', 'own', 'biohazard', 'clean-up', 'business', 'heart', 'out', 'desperately', 'hope', 'succeed', 'obstacles', 'continue', 'mount', 'up', 'characters', 'centered', 'Adams', 'are', 'realistic', 'totally', 'believable', 'socioeconomic', 'standing', 'unmotivated', 'lost', 'soul', 'sister', 'get', 'rich', 'quick/scam', 'artist', 'father', 'way', 'emotionally', 'troubled', 'poor', 'performing', 'son', 'only', 'character', 'clearly', 'place', 'Adams', 'here', 'well', 'spoken', 'kind', 'hearted', 'white', 'professionally', 'sweet', 'hard', 'working', 'fast', 'learning', 'physically', 'fit', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'mid-twenties', 'women', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'gainful', 'employment', 'cleaning', 'houses', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'clearly', 'odds', 'typical', 'stereotype', 'movie', 'hopefully', 'motivating', 'depressingly', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'Production', 'quality', 'good', 'location', 'filming', 'Albuquerque', 'NM', 'ever', 'increasingly', 'popular', 'trend', 'moving', 'making', 'industry', 'well', 'done', 'writing', 'crisp', 'inviting', 'Directing', 'also', 'good', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'job', 'making', 'somewhat', 'unbelievable', 'lives', 'real', 'empathetic', 'especially', 'Adams', 'who', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'making', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'character', 'real']",N/A

Menta, Jr.","[1, 1]","""Sunshine Cleaning"" stars Amy Adams and Emily Blunt as two sisters, Rose and Norah, who start up a cleaning service specializing in tidying up crime scenes.  Cleverly, the remains of the violent crimes they are scrubbing away, as well as the shell-shocked survivors of those crimes (often, spouses of suicides who are hovering in the background as Rose and Norah clean up) remind the sisters of the tragedies and issues in their own lives.If there's a small flaw in the film, it's that the sisters, and their father, played by the always engaging Alan Arkin, have too many issues in their lives that need confronting (as well one central tragedy tying them all together).  This makes the film a bit too busy.  Though not a fatal flaw, I almost felt that all the plot points and character issues could have used a whole season of television, or at least a mini-series, to properly examine them.  Still, things never tip over into incoherence or sketchiness.""Sunshine Cleaning"" has some humor and sexiness that occasionally lighten the violence of the crime scenes and the trials and tribulations going on in everybody's lives.  In the end, this decent little film with a quirky premise that you haven't seen a thousand times before makes for an amiable evening of home viewing.The standard DVD of ""Sunshine Cleaning"" features sharp picture and sound, and a couple of cute extra features, including an interview with two ladies who actually run a company that cleans up after crime scenes, and who acted as consultants on the film.",4,Spreading sunshine on some messy crime scenes,1301356800,"03 29, 2011",2011,1529,"['Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'stars', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'two', 'sisters', 'Rose', 'Norah', 'who', 'start', 'up', 'cleaning', 'service', 'specializing', 'tidying', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'Cleverly', 'remains', 'violent', 'crimes', 'are', 'scrubbing', 'away', 'as', 'well', 'shell-shocked', 'survivors', 'crimes', 'often', 'spouses', 'suicides', 'who', 'are', 'hovering', 'background', 'Rose', 'Norah', 'clean', 'up', 'sisters', 'tragedies', 'issues', 'own', 'lives.If', 'small', 'flaw', 'film', 'sisters', 'father', 'played', 'always', 'engaging', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'issues', 'lives', 'need', 'confronting', 'well', 'one', 'central', 'tragedy', 'tying', 'together', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'busy', 'not', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'almost', 'felt', 'plot', 'points', 'character', 'issues', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'whole', 'season', 'television', 'least', 'mini-series', 'properly', 'examine', 'Still', 'things', 'never', 'tip', 'over', 'incoherence', 'sketchiness', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'humor', 'sexiness', 'occasionally', 'lighten', 'violence', 'crime', 'scenes', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'going', 'everybody', 'lives', 'end', 'decent', 'little', 'film', 'quirky', 'premise', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'amiable', 'evening', 'home', 'viewing.The', 'standard', 'DVD', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'sharp', 'picture', 'sound', 'couple', 'cute', 'extra', 'features', 'including', 'interview', 'two', 'ladies', 'who', 'actually', 'run', 'company', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'who', 'acted', 'consultants', 'film']",N/A

In addition, although Alan Arkin plays a similar role in both (What could easily be considered the Alan Arkin role by now), the film is very different in tone.It consists of two sisters who are behind in life due to their own choices. There are no 'victims' here. These women (played very well by Amy Adams and Emily Blunt) have made some bad decisions in life and as a result are playing catch-up.The movie (unlike Little Miss Sunshine) simply does not have a false note. All the people places and situations are remarkably believable. You will learn more about the do's and don'ts of crime scene clean-up than you thought possible.The movie is also wonderfully free of cynicism and snarkiness. While both those elements certainly have a place in film, it is refreshing to see a warm comedy about real people in transitional circumstances.Overall, Sunshine Cleaning is light fair with warm feelings and a happy ending. Kudos to the film in not making the protagonists perfect or victims of circumstance and kudos for casting two wonderful actresses that actual look and act like they could be real sisters.",4,Sunshine Cleaning....

From the traumatic first scene to the Hollywood ending, there is not a single moment of levity.  SUNSHINE CLEANING is a series of predictable train wrecks that the viewer can see coming for miles and miles.SUNSHINE CLEANING is the story of Rose, a single mother who works as a housekeeper.  Rose needs money to get her smart but mischievous son into a private school, since the public school can't seem to handle him.  At the suggestion of her married cop boyfriend, Rose and her deadbeat sister decide to enter the crime scene cleanup business - totally unprepared and with no knowledge of what they are doing.  The rest of the film is a chronicle of their business, their relationships, and their family.I really wanted to like SUNSHINE CLEANING.  I usually enjoy the efforts of Alan Arkin, Amy Adams, and Emily Blunt, but the writers really let these fine actors down.  The characters are unlikable and mostly unredeemable, and the plot is plodding, depressing, and unfocused.

There is a bit of dark humor along the lines of Little Miss Sunshine. But Sunshine Cleaning is heavier. The familial connections tying the group together bind as tightly as those in Little Miss Sunshine and they are as dysfunctional. Interactions between family members border on fun at times, but there is an overall malaise that takes away from the lightness, and makes the sunshine anemic at best.Two sisters tainted by the loss of a mother, and the memories of her, blunder through life. It doesn't help that their father is lost in his own stupor and dreams and is mostly unavailable to them. One sister (Rose- Amy Adams) has goals but settles for a married high school sweetheart. She meets with him while her sister babysits. Both sisters know the what's going on but they pretend that Rose is taking college classes. Norah (Emily Blunt) is angry and haunted. Dad/Grandpa/Alan Arkin plays the part of the loving but screwy dad/grandpa not unlike the one that he played so well in Little Miss Sunshine. He's not a dirty old man in this version, which was appreciated.The family grows through the opportunity to make scads of money doing what most wouldn't even consider, cleaning up after death. Instead of money, they find something more valuable...self-respect. Mature themes, several F-Bombs. Some gore. A few sex scenes, one rather sudden one.Sunshine Cleaning is well cast and the actors, especially Emily Blunt, shine in these multi-dimensional character studies.Creative film, great acting, interesting character study.

This film gets pretty serious at times and what an enjoyable ride it is made easier by the stellar cast. Amy Adams as Rose and her sister Norah, Emily Blunt, tend to Rose's 7 year old son, Oscar and their own cleaning business they are starting. This is no ordinary cleaning business but a crime scene clean up after the bodies have been moved and evidence secured and all that remains are the blood and the remanants of the deceased's life. What I loved about this film is the humanity of the characters, real people, real problems and real situations that have you pulling for them even as you shake your head at their mistakes. Alan Arkin is a joy as the cranky, scheming father of Rose and Norah, he is at a place as an actor that he brings so much of what you expect from him as an actor while also bringing such subtle differences to all his characters that you never feel you're seeing the same character you might've seen in another movie. Amy Adams is a shining revelation of eternal optimism and she has you pulling for her as she tries win over her own demons. Emily Blunt and Jason Spevak as Oscar are wonderfully funny and real. There is a real honesty amidst some outrageously funny stuff that never panders or lectures and never cheats the audience. I only felt cheated at the end when the movie ended.

I think Indies are just as guilty, and in fact I hate it more when Indies are full of cliches because they have no excuse.  At least Hollywood blockbusters are mostly entertaining.Sunshine Cleaning is no better than a Hollywood movie.  The gimmick:  Two sisters start a biohazard clean-up service.  I'm convinced this movie started with this germ of an idea alone, not with the desire to tell a family drama story.  It could have gone in any direction - tale of hardship; mystery; comedy.  But I'm pretty sure the idea of the cleaning company came first.  Then come a parade of Indie movie cliches we've seen a million times:  Struggling mom hard on her luck; tension between hard-working care-taking sibling and younger ne'er-do-well sibling; eccentric grandparent; parent committing suicide; someone screaming at a passing train to relieve angst; genius kid (made especially cliche because the kid is a trouble-making brat and the sympathetic mom has a ""It's them, not you"" attitude when he's sent to the principal's office), etc, etc.  I wanted something original.  It could have been VERY funny.  The morbid nature of the cleaning business wasn't taken advantage of.  I wanted either more dark comedy, or more creative ""clean-ups.""  Scenes of the sisters on the job were mostly just to establish that they were actually working, not very integral to the plot.All that said, it was worth watching.

Adams plays Rose, a former high school cheerleader and all-around popular girl who has found herself living as a single mother and cleaning houses to make it through the day.  Her sister Norah (Blunt), is still living at home with their father, Joe (Alan Arkin), and is basically an irresponsible slacker with no drive whatsoever.Emotionally beaten, Rose attempts to make herself feel better through the use of self-motivation and by having an affair with her former high school sweetheart, Mac (Steve Zahn).  Her son, Oscar (Jason Spevack), gets into trouble one too many times and Rose decides to pull him out in order to put him in a private school.  Needing money to do this, Mac helps her get started in a biohazard removal and cleaning job at crime scenes.She recruits Norah to assist her and the pair fumble their way through their first couple of jobs until they meet a cleaning store owner named Winston (Clifton Collins, Jr.) who helps them get the proper supplies and certifications to do their job.On one particular cleaning job, Norah finds pictures of a deceased woman's daughter and sets out to find her.  When Norah finds the daughter, however, she cannot tell her why she is seeking her out at first.  The daughter, Lynn (Mary Lynn Rajskub), and Norah quickly find themselves forming a strong bond with each other.Meanwhile, Joe is put in charge of Oscar until Rose can get her young son into a private school.  This means that the pair hit the road together on a number of Joe's money-making schemes.  Their relationship is hilarious and touching at the same time.Slowly getting a foothold on her life, Rose attempts to capture some of her past happiness by visiting an old friend for a baby shower.Unfotunately this leads up to a major accident that threatens to destroy not only Rose's cleaning business, but her life as well.This film is very bittersweet.  Rose is a very likeable character.  She's desperate to be the person that everyone thought she would become after high school, and I believe that many people can relate to her character in that way.  Norah, despite being a complette slacker, is also very appealing.  While her sister has a definite direction that she wants to be going in, Norah has no clue as to what she wants in life.  Once again, I believe that many people can relate to this character's situation.While Adams does an excellent job in the lead role, it is the supporting cast that really makes this film shine.  Arkin is top-notch as always, and provides plenty of humor and heart-tugging moments.  Collins does a wonderful job as Winston, and I found myself wanting to see his character developed more as the film went on.  Spevack plays off of the rest of the cast to make his young character very enjoyable.  I particularly enjoyed his interaction with another young child in a candy store.  Steve Zahn has a small but key role in the film, and does his best with what he has to work with.  Blunt and Rajskub also do excellent jobs in their roles.  Like Zahn, Rajskub has a small part, but what happens between her character and Norah becomes emotionally intense.Overall, I really enjoyed ""Sunshine Cleaning.""  If I had one major gripe, it would be that the end of the film leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and I highly doubt that there will ever be a sequel to resolve these questions.A solid cast, decent writing, and feel-good humor make ""Sunshine Cleaning"" a solid recommendation.",4,Heartbreaking And Heartwarming All At The Same Time,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",2009,3562,"['Amy', 'Adams', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'star', 'two', 'sisters', 'coming', 'crossroads', 'lives', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'Adams', 'plays', 'Rose', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'cheerleader', 'all-around', 'popular', 'girl', 'who', 'found', 'living', 'single', 'mother', 'cleaning', 'houses', 'make', 'day', 'sister', 'Norah', 'Blunt', 'still', 'living', 'home', 'father', 'Joe', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'basically', 'irresponsible', 'slacker', 'drive', 'whatsoever.Emotionally', 'beaten', 'Rose', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'use', 'self-motivation', 'having', 'affair', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Mac', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'son', 'Oscar', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'trouble', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Rose', 'pull', 'out', 'order', 'put', 'private', 'school', 'Needing', 'money', 'do', 'Mac', 'get', 'started', 'biohazard', 'removal', 'cleaning', 'job', 'crime', 'scenes.She', 'Norah', 'assist', 'pair', 'fumble', 'way', 'first', 'couple', 'jobs', 'meet', 'cleaning', 'store', 'owner', 'named', 'Winston', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'who', 'get', 'proper', 'supplies', 'certifications', 'do', 'job.On', 'one', 'particular', 'cleaning', 'job', 'Norah', 'pictures', 'deceased', 'woman', 'daughter', 'out', 'find', 'When', 'Norah', 'daughter', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'why', 'seeking', 'out', 'first', 'daughter', 'Lynn', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'Norah', 'quickly', 'find', 'forming', 'strong', 'bond', 'other.Meanwhile', 'Joe', 'put', 'charge', 'Oscar', 'Rose', 'can', 'get', 'young', 'son', 'private', 'school', 'pair', 'hit', 'road', 'together', 'number', 'Joe', 'money-making', 'schemes', 'relationship', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'same', 'time.Slowly', 'getting', 'foothold', 'life', 'Rose', 'capture', 'past', 'happiness', 'visiting', 'old', 'friend', 'baby', 'shower.Unfotunately', 'up', 'major', 'accident', 'destroy', 'not', 'only', 'Rose', 'cleaning', 'business', 'life', 'well.This', 'film', 'very', 'bittersweet', 'Rose', 'very', 'likeable', 'character', 'desperate', 'be', 'person', 'everyone', 'thought', 'would', 'become', 'high', 'school', 'believe', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'character', 'way', 'Norah', 'being', 'complette', 'slacker', 'also', 'very', 'appealing', 'sister', 'definite', 'direction', 'be', 'going', 'Norah', 'clue', 'what', 'life', 'Once', 'again', 'believe', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'character', 'situation.While', 'Adams', 'excellent', 'job', 'lead', 'role', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'film', 'shine', 'Arkin', 'top-notch', 'always', 'plenty', 'humor', 'heart-tugging', 'moments', 'Collins', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Winston', 'found', 'wanting', 'see', 'character', 'developed', 'more', 'film', 'went', 'Spevack', 'rest', 'cast', 'make', 'young', 'character', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'interaction', 'young', 'child', 'candy', 'store', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'small', 'key', 'role', 'film', 'best', 'what', 'work', 'Blunt', 'Rajskub', 'also', 'do', 'excellent', 'jobs', 'roles', 'Zahn', 'Rajskub', 'small', 'part', 'what', 'character', 'Norah', 'emotionally', 'intense.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'had', 'one', 'major', 'gripe', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'film', 'viewer', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'highly', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'sequel', 'resolve', 'questions.A', 'solid', 'cast', 'decent', 'writing', 'feel-good', 'humor', 'make', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'solid', 'recommendation']",N/A
1240471,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B001UV4XGU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","So, the producers of ""Sunshine Cleaning"" would like you to associate this film with their previous effort ""Little Miss Sunshine.""  And why not?  ""Little Miss Sunshine"" was a commercial crowd-pleaser and an Oscar nominee to boot.  Every advertisement for ""Sunshine Cleaning"" touted the producing team, both movies have ""Sunshine"" in the title, both star Alan Arkin, both are quirky comedies, both have indie cred.  This type of marketing strategy has its pros and cons.  Those expecting the manic antics and outrageousness of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" may be disappointed by the gentler tone of this small film.  Those that were put off by the excesses of ""Little Miss Sunshine's"" quirks may be pleasantly surprised by the realness of character in this small film.For make no mistake, this is a small film.  Well-acted and sweet, ""Sunshine Cleaning"" delivers a few laughs and some nice dramatic moments--but, all in all, the story is so slight that there is no lingering emotional resonance.  I enjoyed it enough, I'd probably give it about 3 1/2 stars, but I wouldn't go out of my way to tell anyone they had to see the picture.That said, I must confess that I'd probably watch Amy Adams in anything.  Here, she's terrific as a mother struggling to make ends meet.  In a dead-end job, involved with a married man, trying to raise a troubled son, a caregiver for her sister and father--Adams displays just the right amount of pluck and determination to get you to back her.  Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin offer solid support as her sister and father respectively.  And the novelty of concept (they are crime scene cleaners) is appealing, if often empty-headed about the politics and legalities of actually working in this industry.With limited expectations, there's much to recommend ""Sunshine Cleaning.""  It's heart is in the right place.  I'll just say that I wanted to love it--but ultimately found it entertaining but inconsequential.

May,"[2, 2]","I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this film and am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised, although it did seem to be ""Little Miss Sunshine""'s darker cousin.Amy Adams stars as Rose, a single mother who opens up a cleaning business at the suggestion of her cop lover (Steve Zahn) and with the help of her troubled sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), in the hopes of being able to pay for private schooling for her gifted young son.  Alan Arkin stars as the father of the sisters and can be considered to be in a continuing role from the one he played in ""Little Miss Sunshine"", but he is enjoyable nonetheless.The cleaning business is unconventional in the sense that the sisters clean up after crime scenes, such as murders, accidents and suicides.  If there's a bloody mess, they'll be there--gagging and sometimes puking, but they'll be there.  The story line becomes a bit tired in the sense that the sisters learn the truly important aspects of life through the people they assist in their business, but you can dig in to these characters and relate to the issues they have gone through.  Their mother died when they were very young, leaving Rose to care for Norah as their father was usually off trying to pitch his newest ""get rich quick"" products to suppliers and failing miserably, as we see him do in the film.Norah develops an unlikely acquaintance through trying to do a good deed and ends up learning more about herself in the process.  Clifton Collins Jr. (The Boondock Saints 2) also stars as the charming one-armed owner of the cleaning supplies store who ends up becoming a very good friend to Rose.There are some humorous moments in this movie, but mostly is a drama and a pretty decent story.  Some elements like the made-for-TV movie the girls keep trying to find on their TV screens seems a bit sappy and feels like it's been done before but all in all, this definitely makes for an enjoyable film about learning about oneself, triumphing over personal conflict and realizing what's truly important in life.",3,A solid flick...,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,2055,"['was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'darker', 'cousin.Amy', 'Adams', 'Rose', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'up', 'cleaning', 'business', 'suggestion', 'cop', 'lover', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'help', 'troubled', 'sister', 'Norah', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'hopes', 'being', 'able', 'pay', 'private', 'schooling', 'gifted', 'young', 'son', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'father', 'sisters', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'continuing', 'role', 'one', 'played', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'enjoyable', 'nonetheless.The', 'cleaning', 'business', 'unconventional', 'sense', 'sisters', 'clean', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'such', 'murders', 'accidents', 'suicides', 'bloody', 'mess', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', 'gagging', 'sometimes', 'puking', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', 'story', 'line', 'bit', 'tired', 'sense', 'sisters', 'learn', 'truly', 'important', 'aspects', 'life', 'people', 'assist', 'business', 'can', 'dig', 'characters', 'relate', 'issues', 'have', 'gone', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'leaving', 'Rose', 'care', 'Norah', 'father', 'was', 'usually', 'off', 'trying', 'pitch', 'newest', 'get', 'rich', 'quick', 'products', 'suppliers', 'failing', 'miserably', 'see', 'do', 'film.Norah', 'unlikely', 'acquaintance', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'deed', 'up', 'learning', 'more', 'herself', 'process', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Boondock', 'Saints', '2', 'also', 'charming', 'one-armed', 'owner', 'cleaning', 'supplies', 'store', 'who', 'up', 'becoming', 'very', 'good', 'friend', 'Rose.There', 'are', 'humorous', 'moments', 'movie', 'mostly', 'drama', 'pretty', 'decent', 'story', 'elements', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'girls', 'keep', 'trying', 'find', 'TV', 'screens', 'bit', 'sappy', 'feels', 'been', 'done', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'learning', 'triumphing', 'personal', 'conflict', 'realizing', 'what', 'truly', 'important', 'life']",N/A
1240476,A204UDH31JJ5ZW,B001UV4XGU,Logan Stewart,"[1, 1]","Sunshine Cleaning stars Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, and Alan Arkin. The movie is, on the surface, about two sisters that start a crime scene clean-up business titled Sunshine Cleaning. Rose (Adams) is a single mom, struggling to come to grips with being a has-been and not marrying the love of her life. Norah (Blunt), the younger sibling, lives at home, stays out late partying, and makes a very small impact on society.Both sisters are in need of money, and, through a series of pulling strings, they start up the crime scene clean-up job. While they work and travel, Rose leaves her son in care of his grandfather, Joe (Arkin).There are many themes operating throughout Sunshine Cleaning, with family being at the top. How much responsibility does an older sibling have in raising a younger sibling, especially in a single parent home? This question runs along with the movie, and the viewer can feel the love Rose has for Norah and the responsibility she feels for her.One thing I enjoyed about Sunshine Cleaning is the realistic setting of the movie. I can easily picture this tragi-comic movie taking place down the road, happening to a family or a friend. Realism is often sobering, and should induce social-introspection, and such is the case of this film.Another plus for the movie is the superb acting of Adams, Blunt, and Arkin. The trio performs brilliantly. You can laugh with them, sympathize for them, and probably cry, too, if you're into that sort of thing. The cast was great, even the minor roles.Overall, I can recommend watching Sunshine Cleaning. It's a heart-warming tale about family, relationships, and perseverance, filled with humor and love, even when dealing with a bloody crime-scene. The movie is MPAA Rated R for language, disturbing images, some sexuality, and drug use, so I wouldn't recommend it for the wee folk.

Amy Adams is the vibrant center of the story.  She plays Rose Lorkowsky, a cute and spirited young single mother.  She is an ex-cheerleader, who is having an affair with Mac (Steve Zahn) her high-school sweetheart.  He is a police detective who married another classmate and has several children.  His wife is pregnant again.  However, he wants Rose to succeed in life and move on from the low-paying maid service job she currently has.  He educates Rose on the high-paying occupation of crime-scene cleanup.Rose likes the idea of making more money, even though the job involves blood, gore and bigger messes.  Rose asks her sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), who has just lost her waitress job,  to be her partner in the new business she is starting.  They make a great team and learn and grow together.  Rose reads her affirmations every morning after her shower to keep her strength and optimism up.Their curmudgeonly father, Joe, is played by Alan Arkin and the endearing young son, Oscar, is played by Jason Spevack.

It's a subtle family drama (i.e., slow to some people) & character development film. It's not a comedy, and it's really nothing like Little Miss Sunshine (except that ""Sunshine"" is in the title). It reminded me more of the Showtime series ""Weeds"" than anything else (although not as funny).The story is rather predictable - two women go into the business of forensic/crime cleanup, and get into trouble along the way. All of the funny scenes were in the trailer, and I'm not sure why the promotional team tried to bill this as a comedy. It's a solid drama that provides a few chuckles. It's sincere, and a cute story nonetheless.I was disappointed that Steve Zahn and Alan Arkin were only in a few short scenes. However, the lead actors were quite strong.

Sure, this means that the movie in question will be able to handle all comers the first weekend. But what about the little guy? What about the small independent movies that don't garner big budget advertising or multiple screens? These films play art houses and special theaters. Or they arrive on DVD with the chance to be found. SUNSHINE CLEANING is one such film.We all have dreams of where we want to go with out lives. Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams) was the head cheerleader, the girl most likely to succeed, the one in love with the big man on campus. Those dreams died and she moved on, becoming a single mother who works for a house cleaning service to make ends meet. She continues to see Mac (Steve Zahn), her knight in shining armor and now a homicide cop, but he's married with children and unlikely to leave.When Rose's son Oscar (Jason Spevack) becomes more than the local school can handle, Rose must find a way to not only do better for herself but to be able to afford a private school for her son. During one of their liaisons, Mac suggest to her she start her own cleaning business cleaning crime scenes. The pay is great and she has time for her son.After thinking it over, Rose takes on the task and recruits her sister Norah (Emily Blunt) to help. But Norah has problems of her own, mainly a rebellious streak that stems from Rose being overprotective and having to deal with a never present mother. But she goes with the flow and helps out Rose, making money for herself as well.The pair start slowly with tips from Mac about which scenes to go to first. Stopping in a local warehouse cleaning supply store, Rose makes friends with the owner, a one armed shop keeper named Winston (Clifton Collins Jr.). Seeing the problems they are having, Winston helps her along the way with suggestions about cleaning supplies and classes she might want to take.Their first job is one that almost makes them give in. A trailer whose owner died several days before being found, Rose and Norah do the job at hand. As they clean, Norah finds a fanny pack that belonged to the home's owner that contains a packet of pictures tied with a bow of a young girl from childhood to graduation, a treasure. It hits Norah that this woman held on to these pictures for a reason and rather than toss them out, she holds on to them and searches for the woman in the photos.The business goes well at first and Rose seems to be getting along fine. But a chance encounter with an old school chum just before she left her old job leaves her feeling hollow and disappointed in the life she expected but that never came to be. Invited to the woman's baby shower, she makes a point of planning to attend to relive her glory days with the women she knew then.Norah seeks out the young woman and finds her in a staling type way. They become friends without the woman knowing the real reason for her meeting Norah. The resolution to this friendship is unexpected and more real than one would think.The chance to make it big comes with a call from State Farm Insurance who wants to hire Sunshine Cleaning for a job. Excited by the prospect, Rose shrugs off her responsibilities to go to the shower and sends Norah to do a job by herself. Face it, a happy ending is not waiting around the corner. Perhaps.The movie does a great job of storytelling, not only moving along at a nice pace but giving us characters who feel real and who we can care about as it unfolds. Rose is a determined woman who wants the best out of life but for some reason just can't seem to reach the goals she sets for herself. Adams does a fantastic job as Rose, bringing home the despair and hope seen in the character from one moment to the next.Emily Blunt does an outstanding job as well, offering a sister with problems that began years ago searching for the answers the questions she's not even quite sure she knows to ask.

When we further learn she's an unwed mother, who is having an affair with a married man, and that has a difficult younger sister (Emily Blunt) whom she helped to raise after their mother committed suicide, the character is fully developed and believable.  The same can be said about Alan Arkin's character (the loving, helpful father) and Emily Blunt (a bit of a drifter, lost in her own misdirection).This is a slice of life film with outstanding performances, which I think will be especially meaningful for sisters--particularly those who have been raised by a single parent or are raising a child on their own.

John Yossarian, Catch 22) and Steve Zahn, the viewer will most probably be pleasantly surprised.If you enjoy a different sort of storyline with excellent acting, this one might be for you.",4,Life Is What Happens To You When You Are Busy Making Plans....or....There's Good Money In Crime Scene Cleanup!,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,1284,"['Life', 'what', 'when', 'are', 'busy', 'making', 'plans', '..Rose', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'sister', 'Norah', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'need', 'change', 'pace', 'new', 'sense', 'direction', 'need', 'quick', 'cash', 'solve', 'pressing', 'issues', 'lives', 'start', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'not', 'long', 'get', 'life-changing', 'phone', 'call', 'State', 'Farm', 'Insurance', 'would', 'like', 'hire', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', ""'different"", 'job.So', 'how', 'Rose', 'Norah', 'come', 'take', 'dirty', 'job', 'cleaning', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'Almost', 'happenstance', 'Rose', 'Norah', 'become', 'Bio-Recovery', 'saying-sift', 'someone', 'garbage', 'pail', 'can', 'really', 'find', 'out', 'everything', 'was', 'shredders', 'course', 'Well', 'cleaning', 'up', 'heinous', 'crime', 'really', 'will', 'tell', 'more', ""'d"", 'ever', 'want', 'know.A', 'film', 'funny', 'bittersweetly', 'sad', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'Sleeper', 'was', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'lot', 'critics', 'gave', 'negative', 'reviews.However', 'story', 'line', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Capt', 'John', 'Yossarian', 'Catch', '22', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'viewer', 'will', 'most', 'probably', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.If', 'enjoy', 'different', 'sort', 'storyline', 'excellent', 'acting', 'one', 'might', 'be']",N/A

But after Oscar gets kicked out of yet another public school, Rose finds herself in need of some quick cash to send him to a private academy.Via the cop she's having an affair with, Rose finds out about biohazard removal/crime scene clean-up, a service that promises to bring in considerably more money than standard cleaning. She drafts her lay-about sister, Norah (Blunt), into helping her, and the two are on their way.In many ways, this movie is about how the characters metamorphose to deal with the troubles in their lives. Each character grows throughout the film, and some of the scenes in which they exhibit that growth are beautiful to watch. By the end of the movie, Rose is a business owner who has found some self-confidence. Her father (Arkin), who hatches one crazy business scheme after another, is putting his money into something he believes in. Norah did less growing up, but Blunt performed so many of her scenes with such total credibility that I can hardly fault her.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, though it can be difficult to watch at times, due to some of the weighty issues the characters are dealing with.",3,Let the sun shine in,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,1323,"['Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'starring', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Rose', 'Adams', 'young', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'maid', 'keep', 'body', 'soul', 'together', 'herself', 'son', 'Oscar', 'Oscar', 'kicked', 'yet', 'public', 'school', 'Rose', 'need', 'quick', 'cash', 'send', 'private', 'academy.Via', 'cop', 'having', 'affair', 'Rose', 'out', 'about', 'biohazard', 'removal/crime', 'scene', 'clean-up', 'service', 'bring', 'considerably', 'more', 'money', 'standard', 'cleaning', 'drafts', 'lay-about', 'sister', 'Norah', 'Blunt', 'helping', 'two', 'are', 'way.In', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'how', 'characters', 'metamorphose', 'deal', 'troubles', 'lives', 'character', 'film', 'scenes', 'exhibit', 'growth', 'are', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'end', 'movie', 'Rose', 'business', 'owner', 'who', 'found', 'self-confidence', 'father', 'Arkin', 'who', 'one', 'crazy', 'business', 'scheme', 'putting', 'money', 'something', 'Norah', 'did', 'less', 'growing', 'up', 'Blunt', 'performed', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'such', 'total', 'credibility', 'can', 'hardly', 'fault', 'her.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'watch', 'times', 'due', 'weighty', 'issues', 'characters', 'are', 'dealing']",N/A

Usually, the writer will add more platitudes to the dialogue to dampen the oddness and make the story seem more familiar.  (Superhero movies do this often.)  There's certainly nothing ordinary about a single mother deciding to start a crime scene cleaning business--even when the economy is bad--but the desperation of Rose Lorkowski (brilliantly played by Amy Adams) and her childless-but-a-child-herself sister Norah (played by Emily Blunt) is so complete that it seems like a good idea. Adams excellent sense of pathos draws the audience in; her situation just sucks, and although she doesn't always make good decisions, she indeed suffers.As great as Adams is in this film, Clifton Collins, Jr. stands out for me.  He takes an essentially thin character (Winston) and makes him vibrant, full of ideas and feelings, even when he's given little to do and little to say.  He does it with such subtlety that it's difficult to pinpoint what he's doing to make the character work.  I haven't seen him in many films, and this seems a shame as he's quite talented.I have no idea why Alan Arkin is in this film.  He plays the same seemingly absent-minded crank as he does in Little Miss Sunshine only he's less funny here.  The role should have been given to someone who would actually try and not phone it in with their own personality.The tone of the film is a bit uneven.  Is this a comedy, a drama, a mash of genres?

But it is not quite as pure and restrained in its storytelling techniques; there are several visual flashbacks and bit of ""Junebug"" (2006) cuteness but these departures do not really get it the way (at least in part because the flashbacks are done so well).  The promo material emphasizes ""funny and gently heartbreaking"" but don't get the film expecting to see a comedy.  There are a few tension relieving black comedy moments in the style of ""Breaking Bad"" (coincidently Tess Harper of ""Tender Mercies"" plays Jesse's mother on that series).  But mostly it is just portrayals of very wounded people trying keep it together enough to function in the world.The film does include an awesome and extremely unusual climatic sequence about 10 minutes before the actual ending.  Just as things seem darkest, Rose (Amy Adams) and Norah (Emily Blunt) unexpectedly get to see their dead mother's appearance in an old made-for-TV movie that they have until then only heard exists.  This film within a film sequence is amazingly moving as the editor cuts between three actresses who look so alike in features and complexions that the customary suspension of disbelief is unnecessary.Rose is a single mom desperate for money after her impulsive 7-year-old son is thrown out of his elementary school.  Life has beaten her up and been downhill for her since high school.  A chronic need for validation has her trapped in a one-way affair with Mac, her high-school boyfriend (Steve Zahn in a nicely restrained performance), who fathered her son but married someone else.  Rose's younger sister, Norah, is a party hard slacker still living with her father and still traumatized by her mother's suicide when Norah was a little girl.Mac (a police detective) tips the two sisters to a business opportunity cleaning up messy crime scenes.  The business gives Rose validation and allows her to break off the relationship with Mac.  It gives Norah glimpses into the lives of other troubled families (they clean up a lot of suicides), she connects with their pain but has to learn that pain is a very individual thing.Credit the success of this film to Adams and Blunt, who became close friends during this production; this translated into a an effortless believability in their portrayal of the dynamic between two sisters (it has simply never been done better).The other inspired element involves Winston (Clifton Collins), a one-armed janitorial supply store owner.  He baby-sits Rose's son and is a resource for Rose as she tracks up the learning curve of her new business.  Collins gently teases this role and transcends a script that is otherwise a little too sunny.The DVD includes an excellent commentary special feature in which the writer and the producer discuss the dynamics of adapting the original script and producing the film.  These are typically extremely lame but this one is very well done and quite useful.Then again, what do I know?

Overall, I was suckered into this film by the great Alan Arkin who won best supporting actor Oscar for ""Little Miss Sunshine"". Also, Amy Adams and Emily Blunt have done some great indie films so the cast of actors really drew me in. Immediately, the film set is exactly as my friend described. It's the beautiful backdrop of Albuquerque, NM. The whole premise is quite simple where two sisters start a new business in cleaning up crime scenes as well as other unfortunate deaths in homes. It sounds pretty gruesome which it is but also quite personal. Both Adams and Blunt are wonderful actresses to have empathized with the recently deceased and surviving partners/relatives. Arkin is just great at scheming with his grandson on his latest plan for selling shrimp to local restaurants at a profit. There is just too many scenes to describe but my favorite one would have to be the baby shower. After you watch it, you can totally relate to the scene.The best part of the DVD is that you can actually watch how the film makers developed the characters and scenes. This is actually based on the lives of 2 women who now clean up crime scenes. It is quite moving to hear from them how these are quite true in the film as well.

It's basically an adult coming-of-age story about two women and their father.  Those who enjoy movies about families and members' relationships with each other will definitely enjoy this one.  There is a romance, or two actually, but the focus is on how the two sisters find empowerment rather than on getting a man - which I found highly refreshing.It's not a zany, fun, movie - more of a serious look at how we interact and grow through events and relationships.  In my opinion, it should have been marketed as such.  Although there are humorous incidents, the movie itself is more a humor-tinged family drama than a comedy.

Sunshine offers only glancing blows, quick and telling, and lets the chips fall where they may.Rose's high-school friends are portrayed as having the most shallow and vapid of lives (their idea of fun is to eat chocolate feces out of diapers at a baby shower), yet they are good hearted and just as much victims of their empty surroundings as the more tragic, down-on-their luck suicides and trailer dwellers near them.The opener, the sporting-good suicide, is treated as just a bother: a blood spattering mess to clean up.  (Wonderful touch: the suicide sprays his breath with Binaca before doing the deed.)But as the movie progresses, Rose and Nora move beyond the physical horror of their job (cleaning up death-scenes, usually violent) to the worse psychological horrors and sad, cluttered loneliness that produced them.The characterization is spectacular, the scenery stark and beautiful and sterile, the acting wonderful.Nothing is resolved, exactly, but the characters all develop before your very eyes.",5,Great Picture,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,1391,"['wonderful', 'indie', 'movie', 'be', 'several', 'things.It', 'moving', 'funny', 'biting', 'sad', 'touching', 'unpredictable', 'wrenching', 'uplifting', 'being', 'sappy', 'Hollywoodesque', 'least.It', 'also', 'great', 'social', 'commentary', 'acid', 'satire', 'American', 'Dream', 'running', 'sands', 'New', 'Mexico', 'dying', 'often', 'suicide.Yet', 'satire', 'never', 'heavy', 'handed', 'Sunshine', 'only', 'glancing', 'blows', 'quick', 'telling', 'chips', 'fall', 'where', 'may.Rose', 'high-school', 'friends', 'are', 'portrayed', 'having', 'most', 'shallow', 'vapid', 'lives', 'idea', 'fun', 'eat', 'chocolate', 'feces', 'diapers', 'baby', 'shower', 'yet', 'are', 'good', 'hearted', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'victims', 'empty', 'surroundings', 'more', 'tragic', 'down-on-their', 'luck', 'suicides', 'trailer', 'dwellers', 'them.The', 'opener', 'sporting-good', 'suicide', 'treated', 'just', 'bother', 'blood', 'spattering', 'mess', 'clean', 'up', 'Wonderful', 'touch', 'suicide', 'breath', 'Binaca', 'doing', 'deed', 'movie', 'Rose', 'Nora', 'move', 'physical', 'horror', 'job', 'cleaning', 'up', 'death-scenes', 'usually', 'violent', 'worse', 'psychological', 'horrors', 'sad', 'cluttered', 'loneliness', 'produced', 'them.The', 'characterization', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'stark', 'beautiful', 'sterile', 'acting', 'wonderful.Nothing', 'resolved', 'exactly', 'characters', 'develop', 'very', 'eyes']",N/A

Kyle,"[1, 1]","When both Lorkowski sisters lose their jobs at once, perky Rose (Amy Adams) gets a tip from her policeman lover and father of her illegitimate son Oscar (Jason Spevack) that crime scene cleaning is a growing business.  With little more than a strong arm and determination, Rose and her emo sister Nora (Blunt) start ironically named Sunshine Cleaning.In short order, the women realize they know little about cleaning up. They seek aid from one-armed Winston (Clifton Collins, Junior) a seller of cleaning chemicals.But it's not just the crime scenes the girls are trying to deal with.  It's long-buried family issues related to their Mom's suicide that being in that particular business only seems to exacerbate. As the film progresses, both sisters and their dad (played by Alan Arkin) learn a great deal about themselves and make some interesting life-changes after facing the aftermath of death.The film, coming from the creators of ""Little Miss Sunshine"", is definitely not of the same caliber. Oddly, I think if the script were done as an English film, the droll dark humor of the piece would come through much stronger than basing the story in New Mexico. While both Adams and Blunt did a credible job, two two male leads-Alan Arkin and Jason Spevack stole the show. I found myself in parts of the film hoping either one of them would show up in the next scene and feeling like I got a bonus when I saw both of them.Warning:  if you have issues with blood, suicide and just plain dark humor, this film is definitely not for you.

1240508,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001UV4XGU,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","Amy Adams is a struggling single mom with a bright kid that she wants to send to private school.  When her no-good cop boyfriend (Steve Zahn) suggests she can make some easy money by cleaning up crime/death scenes...she launches a niche business with her ne'er-do-well sister (Emily Blunt) called SUNSHINE CLEANING.  Sometimes helping her and sometimes standing in her way is her slightly nutty father (Alan Arkin).  Gentle humor and mild drama ensue.That's about it.  SUNSHINE CLEANING has a wonderful cast, with nearly all members contributing understated and deft performances.  The movie is set in Albuquerque, New Mexico (my town!)...so that's an extra plus for me (but probably not you...we mostly see poor neighborhoods of the city and very little of the beauty).  The story is quirky, and the details behind crime scene cleanup are unusual enough to generate some interest.SUNSHINE CLEANING (from many of the folks who brought us LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE) lacks heft.  The performances are understated and so is the whole movie.  The script does not allow for big laughs, nor does it encourage truly dramatic moments.  It's characters are all damaged in some way, but the writer & director seem to have said, ""let's not do anything too over the top here...real life is mostly quiet moments.""  Which leads to a film that made me smile often, sometimes at something mildly funny and sometimes at something gently tender.Adams is the heart of the film.  She simply cannot be less than charming as a performer, and she has some nice scenes.  Early in the film, she comforts an elderly person in whose house a family member has just died.  She has a natural, comforting manner that doesn't feel forced, and we see what a decent person she is.  Emily Blunt is the grit of the film.  Her character has never really settled down...to a job, a home, a path.  You sense her understanding that she's been a bit of a failure and you also sense her resentment at the fact that everyone around her can't help but feel a bit superior.  Putting these two ladies together was a great idea...the film could hardly fail altogether.  Adams has had many great roles in her short career; Blunt is still awaiting something that truly puts all her skills to the test.  Even her great work in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA simply primed me to see her REALLY dig into something.  It hasn't quite happened yet, but she's very good.Steven Zahn is affable as a guy who fools around on his wife...but his part is a dead-end.  Clifton Collins Jr. as a slightly disabled cleaning supply store operator does a very delicate job in his interactions with Adams and her son.  He's another terrific actor (see CAPOTE) still in search of an ideal role.Sadly, it is Alan Arkin that let me down the most.  First of all, his part is written to make him the father in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE again...only MORE so.  The eccentricities from that film are practically mental illness in this film.  He jumps constantly from one ridiculous get-rich-quick scheme to another and seems to care not one wit for the effect he has on others.  And Arkin seems to be phoning it in.  He's the kind of actor that usually seems exactly the same in every part he plays...yet he finds the most subtle nuances that can turn his work from caricature to brilliance.  I've never understood quite how he does it.  In SUNSHINE CLEANING...he doesn't do it.  While he isn't actively offensive in the role, and just found myself not believing him.All in all, this unambitious little film is not a bad way to spend an evening.  I just wish the creators had dared to do a little more.",4,3.5 stars.

Not that it's been tough; the ensuing decade has brought us just two. But Sunshine Cleaning was almost universally well-received when it showed up, and has stayed generally acclaimed (currently running 71% on rotten tomatoes); I figured I'd get around to seeing it eventually. I did, and it seems Ms. Jeffs has learned about the value of subtlety. Not a great deal, mind you; she still has a long, long way to go. But then, Jane Campion made Sweetie before she made The Piano.Rose (Doubt's Amy Adams) and Norah (The Devil Wears Prada's Emily Blunt) are chronically underemployed sisters both in need of cash. Rose's illicit boyfriend, the married Mac (A Perfect Getaway's Steve Zahn), mentions there's great money to be made in crime scene cleanup, and the idea beings brewing in her head. Soon, she's roped Norah in and is juggling learning on the job, taking classes for her real estate license, handling her young son (Ramona and Beezus' Jason Spevack) and space-cadet father (Little Miss Sunshine's Alan Arkin). Things are going well, and there's the possibility of a new, and more workable, romance with Winston (Mindhunters' Clifton Collins, Jr.), the guy who runs the supply shop where Rose and Norah get their supplies. But then Rose hits what seems to be an insurmountable obstacle: a high-school reunion/baby shower...It's not the most original of premises, and it has the feel of ""macabre chick flick"" a time or two, but it's downright funny, thanks to a script from Megan Holley (The Snowflake Conspiracy) and excellent (mostly deadpan) comic timing from all the principals. This is probably never going to enter the vaults of the classics; it feels like a quirky, minor little indie flick (though let's face it, no movie that has a Turteltaub listed as a producer could ever possibly be indie), but not every movie needs to be a classic to make it worth watching. Jeffs has bought some time off the stay in purgatory she earned with Rain by doing Megan Holley's script right on this one. *** 1/2",4,Cute.,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,2213,"['Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', '2008', 'first', 'brush', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'ill-thought', 'heavy-handed', 'adaptation', 'Kirsty', 'Gunn', 'fine', 'novel', 'Rain', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'away', 'films', 'Not', 'been', 'tough', 'ensuing', 'decade', 'brought', 'just', 'two', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'was', 'almost', 'universally', 'well-received', 'when', 'showed', 'up', 'stayed', 'generally', 'acclaimed', 'currently', 'running', '71', '%', 'rotten', 'tomatoes', 'figured', ""'d"", 'get', 'seeing', 'eventually', 'did', 'Ms.', 'Jeffs', 'learned', 'value', 'subtlety', 'Not', 'great', 'deal', 'mind', 'still', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'then', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'made', 'Sweetie', 'made', 'Piano.Rose', 'Doubt', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Norah', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'are', 'chronically', 'underemployed', 'sisters', 'need', 'cash', 'Rose', 'illicit', 'boyfriend', 'married', 'Mac', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'mentions', 'great', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'crime', 'scene', 'cleanup', 'idea', 'beings', 'brewing', 'head', 'Soon', 'roped', 'Norah', 'juggling', 'learning', 'job', 'taking', 'classes', 'real', 'estate', 'license', 'handling', 'young', 'son', 'Ramona', 'Beezus', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'space-cadet', 'father', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Things', 'are', 'going', 'well', 'possibility', 'new', 'more', 'workable', 'romance', 'Winston', 'Mindhunters', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'guy', 'who', 'supply', 'shop', 'where', 'Rose', 'Norah', 'get', 'supplies', 'then', 'Rose', 'what', 'be', 'insurmountable', 'obstacle', 'high-school', 'reunion/baby', 'shower', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'premises', 'feel', 'macabre', 'chick', 'flick', 'time', 'two', 'downright', 'funny', 'thanks', 'script', 'Megan', 'Holley', 'Snowflake', 'Conspiracy', 'excellent', 'mostly', 'comic', 'timing', 'principals', 'probably', 'never', 'going', 'enter', 'vaults', 'classics', 'quirky', 'minor', 'little', 'indie', 'flick', 'let', 'face', 'movie', 'Turteltaub', 'listed', 'producer', 'could', 'ever', 'possibly', 'be', 'indie', 'not', 'movie', 'be', 'classic', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'Jeffs', 'bought', 'time', 'off', 'stay', 'purgatory', 'earned', 'Rain', 'doing', 'Megan', 'Holley', 'script', 'right', 'one', '1/2']",N/A
1240510,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001UV4XGU,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this film.  Based loosely on an interview on NPR that the writers heard with women who had a business doing precisely what the fictional sisters in the film do, it concerns two sisters who undertake a business cleaning up crime scenes in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Rose needs to send her son to a special school while her sister Norah simply needs a job.  They had lost their mother to suicide when they were small children, so taking their new jobs resonates with major events in their lives.  They end up in a job where personal tragedies -- deaths, suicides, accidents -- that are paradoxically good news for them.  A suicide initially means $500 that they didn't previously have, and after they become more skilled at their job it means a great deal more.The film proceeds through a string of small, touching, and exquisite slices of life, people doing the small things that make up human lives.  Each scene reveals a bit more about Rose and Norah and we come to like and sympathize with each the more we learn.  Norah is revealed as a deeply scarred and damaged soul, someone who has never recovered from the horror of discovering her mother's body and her absence in her life.  Rose is less scarred, but suffers from her own disappointments, having been the head cheerleader and the best looking girl in school (she tells the owner of the cleaning supply store where she buys her tools of the trade that attracting men and cheering), but now a single mother with several years of moderate failure behind her, yearning for a genuine caring relationship with a man but persisting in an adulterous affair with her high school sweet heart.  The film ends on a note of quiet hope and reconciliation and feels very appropriate alongside the rest of the film.  My lone complaint with the film was a rather long and unsuccessful scene where Rose talks to her dead mother on a CB radio (it is a one way conversation) in the van that she and her sister have bought for work.  It was a scene that I felt neither worked nor made much sense.  A small blemish on an otherwise splendid film.The best thing about the film is the acting.  Amy Adams as rose continues a string of amazing performances.  I still remember seeing her for the first time on BUFFY in a very small role as Tara Maclay's cousin and in a very small role in SMALLVILLE, and then later as ""The Hot Girl"" on THE OFFICE (ironically, on that show she played Jim's girlfriend for several episodes; Jim is played by John Krasinski, who in real life has been romantically involved with Emily Blunt, who plays Norah in SUNSHINE CLEANING).  She has become in my opinion one of the truly great actresses in the movies.  She is a true beauty, with her huge blue eyes and wonderfully clear skin, but what really makes her a delight is her great skills as an actress.  She seems to be able to play any kind of role and has pretty much become an actress I will see out to see in films (I want to see JULIE AND JULIA in the near future).  I've not seen Emily Blunt all that much, but I hope to see more of her in the future.  She plays Norah with heartbreaking subtlety.  I was impressed tremendously by Clifton Collins, who plays the one-armed owner of the cleaning supply store (it also seems to sell a fair number of model airplane kits -- he seems at one point to be making a model of either a B-25 or B-24, both of which I put together as a kid).  He is one of the most versatile actors working today, transforming himself into virtually any kind of role.  He also played a role in this summer's STAR TREK, but I think he was much more memorable in this film.  The rest of the cast was also superb, including Steve Zahn and 24's Mary Lynn Rajskub.

I would have thought this would be a suitable plotline for plenty of developments but the writer and director kept spinning off minor sub-plots which just took up too much time to resolve and I felt they rather gave up after eighty-eight minutes.All the actors turned out a competent performance but without much of a solid story to work with there was nothing special they could do.  One thing that I did find noticeable were frequent scenes of some very minor activity that added nothing to the story and in fact could have been edited out and no one would notice, maybe they were just padding.*My DVD had an interesting bonus feature: an interview with two ladies who ran a professional crime-scene clean-up company.

Though she lived out what would appear to be every girl's dream in high school - Miss Popularity, head cheerleader and girlfriend to the quarterback  - Rose (Amy Adams) is now a struggling single mom barely eking out a living cleaning other people's houses.  One day, the quarterback (Steve Zahn) - now a married cop who's been seeing Rose on the side for years - suggests she look into cleaning up after crime scenes and biochemical mishaps which pays a good deal better.  Thus, together with her directionless, unemployed younger sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), Rose embarks on a whole new career, albeit one for which she is completely unlicensed and which requires her to step on the toes of some already well-established companies in the area.  Meanwhile, her high-strung, grade-school son (Jason Spevak) tootles around their Albuquerque neighborhood with his eccentric Grandpa Joe - played by, who else?, Alan Arkin - working on an endless series of harebrained, get-rich-quick schemes that raise the young boy's expectations but ultimately go nowhere.""Sunshine Cleaning"" is a sleeper indie comedy that celebrates the entrepreneurial, can-do spirit while still maintaining a relatively clear-eyed view of the world as it is.  Adams and Blunt bring enormous texture to their portrayal of two sisters whose lives - for good or for ill - refuse to conform to the conventional mold society has laid out for them.  Yet, for all the joviality of the movie's tone, the job they're doing conjures up painful memories of a tragic event in the girls' past, one that has both united and divided them through the course of their adult lives.  The job also brings up issues of power in their relationship that have lain dormant for years.Beyond the two lead women, there are splendid performances by Arkin, Spevak, Zahn, Clifton Collins, Jr. (Perry in ""Capote"") as a one-armed model-maker, and Mary Lynn Rajskub (""24,"" ""Mysterious Skin"") as a skittish, strangely reserved young woman to whom Norah stretches forth the hand of friendship after her mother`s death.The screenplay by Megan Holley allows both the drama and humor to arise organically out of the situation and the characters, and, as a result, nothing ever seems over-the-top or forced in the film.  Ditto for Christine Jeff's smooth, incisive direction, which uses the unusual (for movies, at least) New Mexico locale to excellent effect.""Sunshine Cleaning"" provides just the right mixture of quirky humor and understated sentiment to make it a charming and offbeat winner on all counts.",4,wholly likable indie sleeper,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,2585,"['Rose', 'Lorkowski', 's', 'life', 'going', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'lived', 'out', 'what', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'girl', 'dream', 'high', 'school', 'Miss', 'Popularity', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'girlfriend', 'quarterback', 'Rose', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'now', 'struggling', 'single', 'mom', 'barely', 'eking', 'out', 'living', 'cleaning', 'other', 'people', 'houses', 'One', 'day', 'quarterback', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'now', 'married', 'cop', 'who', 'been', 'seeing', 'Rose', 'side', 'years', 'look', 'cleaning', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'biochemical', 'mishaps', 'good', 'deal', 'better', 'Thus', 'together', 'directionless', 'unemployed', 'younger', 'sister', 'Norah', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Rose', 'whole', 'new', 'career', 'one', 'completely', 'unlicensed', 'step', 'toes', 'already', 'well-established', 'companies', 'area', 'Meanwhile', 'high-strung', 'grade-school', 'son', 'Jason', 'Spevak', 'Albuquerque', 'neighborhood', 'eccentric', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'played', 'who', 'else', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'working', 'endless', 'series', 'harebrained', 'get-rich-quick', 'schemes', 'raise', 'young', 'boy', 'expectations', 'ultimately', 'go', 'nowhere', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'sleeper', 'indie', 'comedy', 'entrepreneurial', 'can-do', 'spirit', 'still', 'maintaining', 'relatively', 'clear-eyed', 'view', 'world', 'Adams', 'Blunt', 'bring', 'enormous', 'texture', 'portrayal', 'two', 'sisters', 'lives', 'good', 'ill', 'refuse', 'conform', 'conventional', 'mold', 'society', 'laid', 'out', 'joviality', 'movie', 'tone', 'job', ""'re"", 'doing', 'conjures', 'up', 'painful', 'memories', 'tragic', 'event', 'girls', 'past', 'one', 'united', 'divided', 'course', 'adult', 'lives', 'job', 'also', 'up', 'issues', 'power', 'relationship', 'have', 'lain', 'dormant', 'years.Beyond', 'two', 'lead', 'women', 'are', 'splendid', 'performances', 'Arkin', 'Spevak', 'Zahn', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Perry', 'Capote', 'one-armed', 'model-maker', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', '24', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'skittish', 'strangely', 'reserved', 'young', 'woman', 'whom', 'Norah', 'hand', 'friendship', 'mother', 's', 'death.The', 'screenplay', 'Megan', 'Holley', 'drama', 'humor', 'arise', 'organically', 'situation', 'characters', 'result', 'nothing', 'ever', 'over-the-top', 'forced', 'film', 'Ditto', 'Christine', 'Jeff', 'smooth', 'incisive', 'direction', 'unusual', 'movies', 'least', 'New', 'Mexico', 'locale', 'excellent', 'effect', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'just', 'right', 'mixture', 'quirky', 'humor', 'understated', 'sentiment', 'make', 'charming', 'offbeat', 'winner', 'counts']",N/A

Now.""","[1, 1]","I enjoyed this movie, but the main difficulty for me was watching the many missed opportunities in the script and direction.  My main disappointment was the lack of change in the protagonist--at the end of the movie, she gives up, ready to call it quits and immediately go back to the life that was so unfulfilling, and it's only an action by her father that pulls her up.  Just what has she learned from her experiences?  Nothing, it seems.And while her sister is a great character, the script stops a promising relationship of hers in its tracks in a very unsatisfying way--two minutes in a diner, and it's all over.My major problem with the film, though, was that it was hard to develop sympathy for the characters.  The protagonist is carrying on an affair with a married man (who also starts her on her new career track--does this woman do nothing for herself, without men doing things for her?), and consistently makes bad decisions.  Her anger at her sister for an accident--without ever finding out what really happened--is simply childish and annoying.There's also no real reaction to the idea of cleaning up the scenes of other people's deaths, other than a short speech by the sister about having some sort of ""connection"" with the victims.  And even with that idea presented, there's no real examination of the effects of that connection.As other reviewers have noted, this film is also filled with stock characters and cliches.

With ""Sunshine Cleaning"", there is less humour though, the supposed comedy that the trailers have tacitly promised us prior to its release. Instead, we are presented the inner problems of the two women without painting them with a single neat stroke of characterization; they are complex characters leading very messy lives. Rose (Amy Adams) and Norah (Amy Adams), both of whom have been traumatized in many ways by their mother's suicide, explore their options in bettering their lives by virtue of working as crime scene cleaners. Their chosen career path is an ironic statement: for the first time, they want to be able to finally come into terms with the great loss of losing their mother, and even perhaps the huge empty void created by the mother herself through her suicide. Indeed, it is a grim world for both of these women. They are restless, lost and severely damaged. Their situations are emphasized by the directors simple approach: the film implores the world by its humdrum nature: unglamorous, even snail-crawlingly boring, with people working as maids, where kids are left uneducated, where suicide could seem to be the only option...""Sunshine Cleaning"" is realistic, and even downright terrifying in its minimal approach in viewing life through its grey lenses.  Both Amy Adams and Emily Blunt churn out great performances. This is understated, quiet drama that is delicate with sprinkles of unabrasive humour.

1240522,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B001UV4XGU,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","Sunshine Cleaning has a lot of amusing moments, but it's not the kind of comedy that tries to make you laugh with every line of dialogue or in every situation. Indeed, some of the subject matter is quite dark.Rose Lorkowski (Adams) is a single mother. She's good at getting men to want her, but most don't want to date her or enter into any kind of permanent relationship. She's having an affair with a local cop, Mac (Steve Zahn), but it's clear to us that he has no intention of leaving his pregnant wife. Rose is nothing more than a diversion for him and he's not emotionally invested in the relationship.Rose makes ends meet by working as a maid, but she's hoping to better herself. Mac finds himself investigating a suicide and discovers that it costs around $3,000 to clear up the mess. He suggests to Rose that it would be a lucrative line of work so she decides to give it a try. Rose recruits her sister, Norah (Blunt), and the two buy a van and open a business. Unfortunately, they don't have the required knowledge to do their job safely and within the law. They also don't have any kind of insurance.The two quickly learn and are helped by the owner of a local store who explains what equipment to buy and how to become certified. Rose's life starts to improve.The other main character is Joe (Arkin), the girls' father. He means well and is always promising his grandson trips and presents, but he rarely delivers. He reminds me of my grandfather in some ways and is always looking for some kind of scheme to earn money. One such scheme involves selling shrimp to local restaurants, but he's stuck with them when the restaurant owners refuse to buy for health reasons.This is a quiet film with some good observations on life. One sequence shows Rose desperately trying to fit in with women she knew in school. Why is it important to her that she looks good in front of them? The film doesn't try to make Rose and Norah glamorous. They are portrayed as normal people with flaws and problems to overcome. Both actresses are likable and their relationship feels authentic. Rose has been looking after Norah since their mother died.There's quite a lot of depth to the film at times. Rose realizes that the job sometimes involves becoming a part of people's lives for a brief period. There's a particularly touching scene in which she comforts a confused old woman who has just found out that her husband is dead. This is the kind of film that can make you reflect on sad situations and then make you laugh a minute later.The casting is an important ingredient. Adams and Blunt have good chemistry and Arkin holds everything together. While his character often seems clueless, there's a lot more to him. He clearly cares about his daughters and does his best to be a positive force in their lives.The film also challenges our definition of success. Is career success more important than family or romantic relationships? Does it matter how you make a living if you take care of yourself and the people who are close to you? Should we try and conform to society's definition of success?Adams sometimes accepts questionable roles, but she is talented and can shine in the right part. I was particularly impressed with her supporting role in Doubt, and she shows here that she has a lot to offer as a dramatic actress as well as in lighter roles.",4,Quirky comedy with a lot of heart,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,3351,"['Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'lot', 'amusing', 'moments', 'not', 'kind', 'comedy', 'make', 'line', 'dialogue', 'situation', 'Indeed', 'subject', 'matter', 'quite', 'dark.Rose', 'Lorkowski', 'Adams', 'single', 'mother', 'good', 'getting', 'men', 'want', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'date', 'enter', 'kind', 'permanent', 'relationship', 'having', 'affair', 'local', 'cop', 'Mac', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'clear', 'intention', 'leaving', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Rose', 'nothing', 'more', 'diversion', 'not', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'relationship.Rose', 'ends', 'meet', 'working', 'maid', 'hoping', 'better', 'Mac', 'investigating', 'suicide', 'discovers', '3,000', 'clear', 'up', 'mess', 'Rose', 'would', 'be', 'lucrative', 'line', 'work', 'so', 'give', 'try', 'Rose', 'sister', 'Norah', 'Blunt', 'two', 'buy', 'van', 'open', 'business', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'required', 'knowledge', 'do', 'job', 'safely', 'law', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'insurance.The', 'two', 'quickly', 'learn', 'are', 'helped', 'owner', 'local', 'store', 'who', 'what', 'equipment', 'buy', 'how', 'become', 'certified', 'Rose', 'life', 'improve.The', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'Joe', 'Arkin', 'girls', 'father', 'well', 'always', 'promising', 'grandson', 'trips', 'presents', 'rarely', 'grandfather', 'ways', 'always', 'looking', 'kind', 'scheme', 'earn', 'money', 'One', 'such', 'scheme', 'involves', 'selling', 'shrimp', 'local', 'restaurants', 'stuck', 'when', 'restaurant', 'owners', 'refuse', 'buy', 'health', 'reasons.This', 'quiet', 'film', 'good', 'observations', 'life', 'One', 'sequence', 'shows', 'Rose', 'desperately', 'trying', 'fit', 'women', 'knew', 'school', 'Why', 'important', 'good', 'front', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'Rose', 'Norah', 'glamorous', 'are', 'portrayed', 'normal', 'people', 'flaws', 'problems', 'overcome', 'actresses', 'are', 'likable', 'relationship', 'feels', 'authentic', 'Rose', 'been', 'looking', 'Norah', 'mother', 'quite', 'lot', 'depth', 'film', 'times', 'Rose', 'job', 'sometimes', 'becoming', 'part', 'people', 'lives', 'brief', 'period', 'particularly', 'touching', 'scene', 'confused', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'husband', 'dead', 'kind', 'film', 'can', 'make', 'reflect', 'sad', 'situations', 'then', 'make', 'minute', 'later.The', 'casting', 'important', 'ingredient', 'Adams', 'Blunt', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Arkin', 'everything', 'together', 'character', 'often', 'clueless', 'lot', 'more', 'clearly', 'daughters', 'best', 'be', 'positive', 'force', 'lives.The', 'film', 'also', 'definition', 'success', 'career', 'success', 'more', 'important', 'family', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'matter', 'how', 'make', 'living', 'take', 'care', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'close', 'Should', 'try', 'conform', 'society', 'definition', 'success', 'Adams', 'sometimes', 'questionable', 'roles', 'talented', 'can', 'shine', 'right', 'part', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'supporting', 'role', 'Doubt', 'here', 'lot', 'offer', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'as', 'well', 'lighter', 'roles']",N/A

It seems that MANY of the characters in the film - including the leads - had to deal with a suicidal parent. We watch in the first few moments of this film where the public school system can't handle a 10-year-old boy and his never-married mother just takes him out and keeps him home - with no visits from the Department of Social Services! Its that kind of movie. We have the requisite lesbian advance from one character and we watch one of the leads (Emily Blunt) smoke some weed to remember her mother.The acting is fine but the film seemed to drag - even at only 91 minutes.The bonuses include a Writer and Producer commentary - which I did not listen to - and a fairly interesting 10-minute feature - ""A Fresh Look at a Dirty Business"" - where a pair of female partners who clean up crime scenes for a living explain the true and false scenes in the script.Like many small independent films, this is worth watching but not going out of you way to discover.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,"This film says ""Independent"" all over it.",1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,1362,"['film', 'Independent', 'it.Okay', 'are', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'here', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'delightful', 'new', 'Julia', 'Julie', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'reprising', 'role', 'not', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'who', 'had', 'same', 'producers', 'film', 'story', 'ordinary', 'lower', 'middle-class', 'folks', 'living', 'Albuquerque', 'NM', 'trying', 'get', 'lives', 'MANY', 'characters', 'film', 'including', 'leads', 'had', 'deal', 'suicidal', 'parent', 'watch', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', '10-year-old', 'boy', 'never-married', 'mother', 'just', 'out', 'home', 'visits', 'Department', 'Social', 'Services', 'kind', 'movie', 'have', 'requisite', 'lesbian', 'advance', 'one', 'character', 'watch', 'one', 'leads', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'smoke', 'weed', 'remember', 'mother.The', 'acting', 'fine', 'film', 'seemed', 'drag', 'even', 'only', '91', 'minutes.The', 'bonuses', 'include', 'Writer', 'Producer', 'commentary', 'did', 'not', 'listen', 'fairly', 'interesting', '10-minute', 'feature', 'Fresh', 'Look', 'Dirty', 'Business', 'where', 'pair', 'female', 'partners', 'who', 'clean', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'living', 'explain', 'true', 'false', 'scenes', 'script.Like', 'many', 'small', 'independent', 'films', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'going', 'way', 'discover.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

1240526,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001UV4XGU,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","I'm a fan of both Amy Adams and Emily Blunt, so I was looking forward to seeing ""Sunshine Cleaners,"" which I was under the impression was a comedy.  It's not, though there are some darkly amusing moments scattered throughout.  Broadly speaking, this is a movie about a dysfunctional family --  the story of two imperfect sisters and their eccentric father Joe (Alan Arkin).  Both Rose (Adams) and Norah (Blunt) Lokowski  are in need of money.  Rose cleans people's homes for a living, but is depressed at how the women she went to school with have gone on to have successful careers and happy marriages.  Norah seems stuck in a state of adolescence as she can't hold down a job, prefers getting high with friends, and has never learned one of the hallmarks of maturity -- personal responsibility.  When the young women hear about a post-crime scene cleanup operation, they're intrigued at how lucrative the dirty business can be.  They start their own cleanup company, experiencing horror, amusement, and learning that there are strict laws governing the disposal of material that comes under the heading of biohazardous.  Though the performances are first-rate, the script runs on without sufficient dramatic peaks.  The cleanup sequences are filmed so as not to actually disgust the viewer, but the movie is about too many things:  Rose's affair with a married man; Joe's relationship with his grandson;  Norah's sibling history with Rose;  Rose's son Oscar's behavior problems in school; the day-to-day life of a team that cleans up crime scenes; Joe's ill-thought-out schemes to make some money; and Rose's self-deprecation at living a life her Most Popular Girl status in high school never hinted at.  Arkin does a rehash of the eccentric patriarch he played in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" with no new embellishments.  Much of the problem with the movie lies with director Christine Jeffs, who in one case (Blunt) never fully taps a performer's potential and in another case (Arkin) allows an actor to take the easy path of mirroring an earlier movie role.  ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is a pleasant movie that never really takes off.",3,"Interesting Idea, Underwhelming Script",1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,2126,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaners', 'was', 'impression', 'was', 'comedy', 'not', 'are', 'darkly', 'amusing', 'moments', 'scattered', 'Broadly', 'speaking', 'movie', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'story', 'two', 'imperfect', 'sisters', 'eccentric', 'father', 'Joe', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Rose', 'Adams', 'Norah', 'Blunt', 'Lokowski', 'are', 'need', 'money', 'Rose', 'cleans', 'people', 'homes', 'living', 'depressed', 'how', 'women', 'went', 'school', 'have', 'gone', 'have', 'successful', 'careers', 'happy', 'marriages', 'Norah', 'stuck', 'state', 'adolescence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'down', 'job', 'prefers', 'getting', 'high', 'friends', 'never', 'learned', 'one', 'hallmarks', 'maturity', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'When', 'young', 'women', 'hear', 'post-crime', 'scene', 'cleanup', 'operation', ""'re"", 'intrigued', 'how', 'lucrative', 'dirty', 'business', 'can', 'be', 'start', 'own', 'cleanup', 'company', 'experiencing', 'horror', 'amusement', 'learning', 'are', 'strict', 'laws', 'governing', 'disposal', 'material', 'heading', 'biohazardous', 'performances', 'are', 'first-rate', 'script', 'sufficient', 'dramatic', 'peaks', 'cleanup', 'sequences', 'are', 'filmed', 'so', 'not', 'actually', 'disgust', 'viewer', 'movie', 'about', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'Rose', 'affair', 'married', 'man', 'Joe', 'relationship', 'grandson', 'Norah', 'sibling', 'history', 'Rose', 'Rose', 'son', 'Oscar', 'behavior', 'problems', 'school', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'team', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'Joe', 'ill-thought-out', 'schemes', 'make', 'money', 'Rose', 'self-deprecation', 'living', 'life', 'Most', 'Popular', 'Girl', 'status', 'high', 'school', 'never', 'hinted', 'Arkin', 'rehash', 'eccentric', 'patriarch', 'played', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'new', 'embellishments', 'Much', 'problem', 'movie', 'director', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'who', 'one', 'case', 'Blunt', 'never', 'fully', 'performer', 'potential', 'case', 'Arkin', 'actor', 'take', 'easy', 'path', 'mirroring', 'earlier', 'movie', 'role', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'off']",N/A
1240527,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001UV4XGU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 2]","""Sunshine Cleaning"", the new film from Christine Jeffs (""Sylvia"" starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig) is an enjoyable diversion. It has all the hallmarks of a breakout independent film, off-center wacky characters, unusual story line, slice of life dramatic situations. It has the early box office of other breakout hits. But it also feels a little too calculated, a little too engineered to make it a ""truly memorable experience"", to help it rise to the levels of other genuine hits like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" or ""Broken Flowers"".Rose (Amy Adams) cleans houses for a living in Albuquerque. The single mother of Oscar (Jason Spevack), she has to start earning more money, to send him to a private school as he has been kicked out of every public elementary school for behavior problems. Her boyfriend, Mac (Steve Zahn), a married cop who is having an affair with her, tells her about a crime scene cleaning service he saw during one of his calls. He starts throwing business to her and she enlists the aid of her sister, Norah (Emily Blunt, ""The Devil Wears Prada"") who can't hold a job and seems reluctant to get involved. Their dad, Joe (Alan Arkin) is happy to watch Oscar while they are out working and takes him along as he tries various sales schemes, to keep trying to make money. As the two sisters get more and more involved in the business, Rose becomes friends with Winston (Clifton Collins, Jr., ""Capote""), the one armed man who runs the supply shop they use for supplies. At one crime scene, Norah comes across photos of a young lady at the home of a deceased old woman. She decides to track her down and tell the woman about her mom's death. When she meets Lynn (Mary Lynn Rajskub, TV's ""24""), she lies and they become friends.The best things about ""Sunshine Cleaning"", what sets it above most other films, are the performances by the two lead actresses, Amy Adams and Emily Blunt. They are both very good and give us a little window into the lives of these two people.Amy Adams has such an undeniable charm and skill it is easy to see why she makes all of the characters she has played seem so real, so effortless. She first gained attention as the pregnant stepsister in ""Junebug"", a very independent slice of life comedy about a young man who returns home to his roots with his fiancee who must deal with the culture shock when he runs away to deal with work, leaving her abandoned. ""Enchanted"", ""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"", ""Doubt"" and many others show the diverse range of this actress.Adams plays Rose, the older daughter of a man who has tried his best to raise his two daughters. But because their mother left the picture very early, the two sisters have had to deal with a lot and Rose lost a lot of her childhood caring for her more impetuous sister, Norah. Now that she is an adult, she has to care for her son, Oskar, and cleans houses to provide for him. But Rose isn't perfect and carries on an affair with her high school sweetheart, Mac, hoping for the day he will leave his wife and return to her.One day, as Rose is cleaning the house of a new client, she meets the owner, a former high school girlfriend who is living a lot better than she is, pregnant again. The woman invites Rose to the baby shower and this prompts her, pushes her closer to making the decision to move into her new business. But she realizes she will need help and turns to her sister.As Rose and Norah begin the new business, they learn by trial, making mistakes, finding out rules and regulations as they go. And Winston recognizes this, giving them some literature and guidance to help them along.As we get to know Rose, it appears that she is very level headed, calm, the one who makes the right decisions. So it is a little shocking, but also a little refreshing to see her carry on an affair with Mac. Even though he is always trying to do good, watching her carry on the affair shows she makes mistakes. It makes her appear all the more human and even more interesting. Later, we learn a little more about their history and their relationship becomes ever more poignant and sad. It is a nice, interesting and very touching performance from Adams.Emily Blunt plays Norah, who still lives at home with her father and can't seem to hold down a job. But she is always available to watch Oskar, who she adores.When Rose asks her to help out with the business, she tries hard to avoid it, but can't. She isn't working and can use the money. Initially, it is as difficult for her to face some of the things they have to clean up, as it is difficult for her to simply work hard. It's difficult for both of them. But Rose puts on a professional face and charges forward into the business. Because Norah has less as stake, she rebels more. But does she have less at stake? You can see Blunt infuse the character with doubt and maybe even a little self-loathing. Is she going to live with her dad forever? Will she be able to ever hold down a job?When she meets Lynn (Mary Lynn Rajskub), their relationship goes down some interesting roads and gives us a more full picture of Norah. She is a confused woman who needs to make some decisions.But the film is ultimately a little too calculated. It is produced by the same people involved in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and it definitely feels like they are trying to incorporate a formula into the mix here. The wacky grandfather (interestingly, played by Alan Arkin in both films) is a bit off center and tries wacky things. In ""Little Miss"", he was not adverse to buying porn and talking about masturbation. In ""Sunshine"", he tries a couple of get rich quick schemes, including trying to sell gourmet popcorn to candy shops and shrimp ""that fell off a truck"" to a Mexican restaurant he frequents. And he even has a couple of dramatic moments, but these almost feel scheduled somehow. Okay, in ""Little Miss"", we got teary eyed at 56 minutes. So we better have a similar moment in ""Sunshine"". It seems like the filmmakers are trying to hit certain points, include certain emotions and funny bits that have helped successful independent films in the past. If they helped other films, they should help this one, right?Both films have a precocious young kid in the mix. At least in ""Sunshine"", they changed the gender. Rose's little boy Oskar gets into a lot of trouble at school and Rose will do nothing but support him, so she yanks him out of one class after another. And he loves spending time with his grandfather, helping him in his schemes. He's a cute kid. And his relationship with his relationship with grandpa is cute. But this worked so much better in ""Little Miss Sunshine"". Remember?Clifton Collins Jr. and Steve Zahn add a nice balance to the cast, making their few scenes memorable and rounding out the quirkiness level.""Sunshine Cleaning"" is an enjoyable diversion. And many people are going to the film, in all likelihood for the very reasons I have listed above. It is an awfully familiar 'feel good' film. People will laugh. Some may even cry. Most will leave the theater enjoying the experience. But I doubt most will remember the film because it will quickly fade away into the subconscious, confused with other similar films. Until it is forgotten.Personally, when I go to an independent film, I want a little more bite. I want to feel like I have just seen something no studio would ever make. I want to be surprised, challenged, moved. Why do I look for these things in independent films? Because the majority of studio fare is produced for a mass audience, a mass audience of teenaged boys. When an independent film begins to closely resemble many of the most popular independent films they become less interesting, less surprising, less challenging. And you have to ask yourself.

1240529,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B001UV4XGU,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[3, 8]","This is one of those movies that uses music cues in order to tell us how to feel. And when you aren't feeling what you're supposed to be feeling then you are just bored and annoyed. Maybe it's the scene where Amy Adams says how much she wanted to go to the baby shower because all of her old friends saw her as just a cleaner and the sisters have a conversation about their mother's funeral accompanied by a twangy guitar riff. Maybe it's the uplifting music that comes when the one sister has her hand up under the railroad tracks and gets to feel the train going above her and screaming in one of those ""protagonist finding her freedom"" scenes. Regardless, the music just tells me that I'm supposed to be feeling something that isn't boredom, annoyance or irritation at these dull women with their dull little story about how they are failures. Where I am supposed to feel moved to tears, I'm moved to looking at my watch.This is one of those movies that feels condescending in all the wrong ways. Not only does it tell the audience what they are supposed to feel, it tries to get drama where there is no drama and removes all interest. Sisters fighting. Two people who can't ever get things right. These are supposedly great moments of drama, but instead they just drag as the screenwriter approximates what it's like to live in a world without hope or joy.What makes this movie worse is the fact that it doesn't seem to care much about the cleaning business. When the hook is people who clean up after dead bodies, you would think that there would be some stuff about the bodies. In fact, it seems like there really is no knowledge of the cleaning business, much less the biohazard cleaning business that went into the screenplay. Maybe the fact that I readThe Mystic Arts of Erasing All Signs of Death: A Novelonly a few months ago, but I just kept waiting for someone to notice that these people weren't licensed and they didn't seem to know what they were doing and at any point the brains and maggots of the crime scene would show up.This is one of the dullest Sundance movies from the mold of ""whacky but boring"" people having dull adventures.",1,Oh come on,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,2152,"['one', 'movies', 'music', 'cues', 'order', 'tell', 'how', 'feel', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'feeling', 'then', 'are', 'just', 'bored', 'annoyed', 'Maybe', 'scene', 'where', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'how', 'much', 'wanted', 'go', 'baby', 'shower', 'old', 'friends', 'saw', 'as', 'just', 'cleaner', 'sisters', 'have', 'conversation', 'mother', 'funeral', 'accompanied', 'twangy', 'guitar', 'riff', 'uplifting', 'music', 'when', 'one', 'sister', 'hand', 'up', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'feel', 'train', 'going', 'screaming', 'one', 'protagonist', 'finding', 'freedom', 'scenes', 'Regardless', 'music', 'just', 'tells', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'be', 'feeling', 'something', ""n't"", 'boredom', 'annoyance', 'irritation', 'dull', 'women', 'dull', 'little', 'story', 'how', 'are', 'failures', 'Where', 'am', 'supposed', 'feel', 'moved', 'tears', ""'m"", 'moved', 'looking', 'watch.This', 'one', 'movies', 'feels', 'condescending', 'wrong', 'ways', 'Not', 'only', 'tell', 'audience', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'get', 'drama', 'where', 'drama', 'interest', 'Sisters', 'fighting', 'Two', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'are', 'supposedly', 'great', 'moments', 'drama', 'instead', 'just', 'drag', 'screenwriter', 'what', 'live', 'world', 'hope', 'joy.What', 'movie', 'worse', 'fact', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'much', 'cleaning', 'business', 'When', 'hook', 'people', 'who', 'clean', 'up', 'dead', 'bodies', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'stuff', 'bodies', 'fact', 'really', 'knowledge', 'cleaning', 'business', 'much', 'less', 'biohazard', 'cleaning', 'business', 'went', 'screenplay', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'readThe', 'Mystic', 'Arts', 'Erasing', 'Signs', 'Death', 'Novelonly', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'just', 'kept', 'waiting', 'someone', 'notice', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'licensed', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'point', 'brains', 'maggots', 'crime', 'scene', 'would', 'show', 'up.This', 'one', 'dullest', 'Sundance', 'movies', 'mold', 'whacky', 'boring', 'people', 'having', 'dull', 'adventures']",N/A
1240530,A3RICVFW2YD1LZ,B001UV4XGU,"T. Scarillo ""music snob""","[0, 0]","""Sunshine Cleaning"" is a modest little gem of an indie film (it's pretty low-budget, not produced by a major), and is principally a character-driven story.  The plot revolves around Rose, a single mother, who starts a crime-scene cleanup company, with her sister.  During the course of the film, the story arc (among other events, without giving away any spoilers) covers the sisters' backstory of what happened years before to their mother; insight into what crime/trauma-scene cleanup services do (it's a very interesting niche business, it turns out); the sisters' father (played by Alan Arkin), who is a salesman constantly looking for new things to sell just to get by (everything from shrimp to corn snacks), and Rose's life-arc of unfulfilled dreams and missed opportunities, while simply trying to find her place in the world.  The entire cast is terrific - this is a well-cast film on every level.  Amy Adams, playing Rose, is very quickly establishing herself as a fine, versatile actress, and she fully inhabits her character - she totally puts across the daily struggles of the single mother, who is also looking at the unfulfilled promise of her life (she was a popular girl in high school, but everything since is far off that peak).  Emily Blunt, as the sister, is deeply affected by something she finds at one of the cleanups (leading to a somewhat confusing subplot involving Mary Lynn Rajskub's (who you've seen on ""24"") character - as with the rest of the cast, she's very good in the film, though it took me a bit to see where they were going with that thread).  Arkin is playing a variation of the cranky grandpa that he played in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (which was made by the same producers); others in the cast include Clifton Collins as the bio-cleanup shop owner, and Steve Zahn as the married cop that Rose is sleeping with - I was never a big fan of Zahn's previous work, but he was pretty impressive here.  All roles in the film seem like `real' people, which is a compliment - the actors created fully-dimensional, fleshed-out characters - there are some really wonderful scenes here that pack emotional punch.Overall, a nice if modest film to watch, very well cast, and probably will please those who enjoy character-driven films.  The DVD includes  the film's trailer, a writer & producer commentary (which I didn't listen to), and a brief documentary on a real-life crime/trauma scene cleanup crew.",4,"Well-cast little gem of a film - Amy Adams is terrific, rest of the cast is also excellent",1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,2430,"['Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'modest', 'little', 'gem', 'indie', 'film', 'pretty', 'low-budget', 'not', 'produced', 'major', 'principally', 'character-driven', 'story', 'plot', 'around', 'Rose', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'crime-scene', 'cleanup', 'company', 'sister', 'course', 'film', 'story', 'arc', 'other', 'events', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'sisters', 'backstory', 'what', 'happened', 'years', 'mother', 'insight', 'what', 'crime/trauma-scene', 'cleanup', 'services', 'do', 'very', 'interesting', 'niche', 'business', 'out', 'sisters', 'father', 'played', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'salesman', 'constantly', 'looking', 'new', 'things', 'sell', 'just', 'get', 'everything', 'shrimp', 'corn', 'snacks', 'Rose', 'life-arc', 'unfulfilled', 'dreams', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'simply', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'entire', 'cast', 'terrific', 'well-cast', 'film', 'level', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'playing', 'Rose', 'very', 'quickly', 'establishing', 'fine', 'versatile', 'actress', 'fully', 'character', 'totally', 'daily', 'struggles', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'also', 'looking', 'unfulfilled', 'promise', 'life', 'was', 'popular', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'everything', 'far', 'off', 'peak', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'sister', 'deeply', 'affected', 'something', 'one', 'cleanups', 'leading', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', '24', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'took', 'bit', 'see', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'thread', 'Arkin', 'playing', 'variation', 'cranky', 'grandpa', 'played', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'producers', 'others', 'cast', 'include', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'bio-cleanup', 'shop', 'owner', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'married', 'cop', 'Rose', 'sleeping', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'Zahn', 'previous', 'work', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'here', 'roles', 'film', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'compliment', 'actors', 'created', 'fully-dimensional', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'here', 'pack', 'emotional', 'punch.Overall', 'nice', 'modest', 'film', 'watch', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'probably', 'will', 'please', 'who', 'enjoy', 'character-driven', 'films', 'DVD', 'film', 'trailer', 'writer', 'producer', 'commentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'brief', 'documentary', 'real-life', 'crime/trauma', 'scene', 'cleanup', 'crew']",N/A
1240531,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001UV4XGU,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","It is hard to hate a film like ""Sunshine Cleaning."" It is made with low budget, has interesting characters with excellent acting from the impressive cast including Amy Adams, Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin, plus the nice location of Albuquerque. Interestingly three of the producers of ""Sunshine Cleaning"" - Jeb Brody, Peter Saraf and Marc Turtletaub - are also the producers of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (of which cast also included Alan Arkin).To send her son to a private school, single mother Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams) sets up a small company specializing in cleaning up the crime scenes with her trouble-making sister Norah (Emily Blunt). In this comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family we are introduced to a group of people (some deeply troubled, some quirky) living in Albuquerque. The film's feel-good tone, if not the entire story, may remind you of another ""Sunshine"" film.There is nothing wrong with the film's narrative or characters. And, sorry, there is nothing special either. For all its impressive performances from the leads, I couldn't help thinking that I had seen the film somewhere else before - troubled relations between sisters and their hidden past, mother and her child who starts to behave strangely, grumpy grandfather talking about his ""business acumen"" (played by Alan Arkin who did a similar role in ""Little Miss Sunshine). Steve Zahn appears as Mac, a local police officer (and former high school hero), having an affair with Amy Adam's heroine. His acting is very good (as he always is), but his role give me a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.I am not saying ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is bad, but I can safely say the director Christine Jeffs (""Sylvia"") is wasting the promising material that could have made a much better film. Clifton Collins Jr. is Winston, a one-armed hardware store owner who gives her some good advice on the job. He is quite effective, and perhaps his role is more engaging than the main story, but the director seems to have forgotten to explore it.""Sunshine Cleaning"" has many good premises. It is a good film though it could have made much better use of them.",3,Average Indie Comedy Drama,1248998400,"07 31, 2009",2009,2112,"['hard', 'hate', 'film', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'interesting', 'characters', 'excellent', 'acting', 'impressive', 'cast', 'including', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'nice', 'location', 'Albuquerque', 'Interestingly', 'three', 'producers', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'Jeb', 'Brody', 'Peter', 'Saraf', 'Marc', 'Turtletaub', 'are', 'also', 'producers', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'cast', 'also', 'included', 'Alan', 'Arkin', '.To', 'send', 'son', 'private', 'school', 'single', 'mother', 'Rose', 'Lorkowski', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'up', 'small', 'company', 'specializing', 'cleaning', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'trouble-making', 'sister', 'Norah', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'comedy-drama', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'are', 'introduced', 'group', 'people', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'quirky', 'living', 'Albuquerque', 'film', 'feel-good', 'tone', 'not', 'entire', 'story', 'may', 'remind', 'Sunshine', 'film.There', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'film', 'narrative', 'characters', 'sorry', 'nothing', 'special', 'either', 'impressive', 'performances', 'leads', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'somewhere', 'else', 'troubled', 'relations', 'sisters', 'hidden', 'past', 'mother', 'child', 'who', 'behave', 'strangely', 'grumpy', 'grandfather', 'talking', 'business', 'acumen', 'played', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'did', 'similar', 'role', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Mac', 'local', 'police', 'officer', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'hero', 'having', 'affair', 'Amy', 'Adam', 'heroine', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'always', 'role', 'give', 'feeling', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu.I', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'bad', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'director', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'Sylvia', 'wasting', 'promising', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Winston', 'one-armed', 'hardware', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'good', 'advice', 'job', 'quite', 'effective', 'perhaps', 'role', 'more', 'engaging', 'main', 'story', 'director', 'have', 'forgotten', 'explore', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'many', 'good', 'premises', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'use']",N/A

The two sisters have some maturing to do in the story but because of their past things didn't work out so well no matter how hard their father tried so their present day life is not the best.  Their father, played by Alan Arkin, has a good relationship with his grandson and tries his best to help him especially when he is in trouble at school due to his OCD problems. The sisters have a connection with the cleaning due a death in their past - it helps them to understand the situations of the clients more than most.  All of the actors are really good.The movie is not really gross considering the material but it is not a family movie - it is ""R"" rated due to the language and states of undress although one scene is sort of graphic.I liked the ending -- it is uplifting and the girls have done some maturing and made better decisions in their lives.There is an audio commentary by the writer, Megan Holley and producer Glenn Willamson. I especially liked the extra feature called ""A Fresh Look at a Dirty Business"" by two women who have been in the business of cleaning up a crime or trauma scene for many years -- I really learned a lot and they point out the parts of the movie that are similar and different from the real life work.I enjoyed the story but do not recommend to buy this movie but maybe to rent it or wait for it on cable or satellite TV.

1240533,AY6A8KPYCE6B0,B001UV4XGU,Tyson,"[4, 7]","So I love Emily Blunt and I love Amy Adams and usually am a sucker for those quirky indie films likeThe Squid and the Whale (Special Edition)andLittle Miss Sunshinebut this one just couldn't keep my interest.Blunt and Adams are sisters tied together by hardships, poverty, and Amy's oddball 8 year old son, who happens to get in trouble at school for licking things.  As money gets more and more scarce they go into the dirty business of cleaning up after crime scenes.  It pays well, and for a while things are looking better.  But some of the bloody messes remind the sisters of their own violent pasts and emotion ensues.Performances are top-notch by the whole cast (Amy Adams once again playing the perfect timid girl amidst chaos) but the screenplay and mood are just not up to par.  With a title like Sunshine Cleaning you expect some silly quirky mood changes as the girls mop up blood and brain matter, carry toxic mattresses and illegally put them in the dumpster, and yet there doesn't ever seem to be a variance in the tone or feel at any point.

One problem is that she's surrounded by former high school classmates who've already done so, and she's their house-cleaner. Another problem is that she never had a role model. Her father keeps trying to get ahead with one gray-market deal or another, and keeps not doing it. Yet another is her sister ... but Rose keeps trying anyway. And, in her way, making it.Although this has no relation toLittle Miss Sunshine, the two movies have much of the same spirit. In each, a dysfunctional family on the verge of economic collapse does its inept best for one of their own. In each, pure dogged repetition of self-motivational messages takes the place of any real reward from the world around them. In each, the ones with just a little share it with those who have nothing at all. And, in each, the hard work does pay off in the end.A few things didn't quite make it for me in this movie. Rose's isolation and friendlessness in her life-long home town doesn't quite fit, for example. Norah's miscarried love life didn't seem to add much to the plot either. And Lynn - well, I liked her too much to see her treated so badly by the script. Maybe that's what really carried this movie, though. Even if I didn't much care for the plot, I really liked the characters. I wanted them to succeed.

Freeman ""Zach""","[4, 6]","As someone who didn't fall in love with Little Miss Sunshine, this second ""sunshine""-titled film from the same producers didn't catch my eye from the beginning. And after I finally decided to check it out after a few good recommendations from friends I have to say that I haven't changed my mind. The trailer makes this film look like a middling dramedy slightly less funny than Little Miss Sunshine and that's what the film turns out to be. Amy Adams is a decent actress but has received a bit too much acclaim over the past few years since her breakout in Junebug. She's enjoyable here but the script doesn't give the audience much reason to support her character, painted as an ex-head cheerleader still sleeping with her (now-married) ex-boyfriend from high school and working as a cleaning woman. It's hard to tell if this is by design or by accident. I felt equally apathetic towards Emily Blunt's slightly lazy younger sister character. Only Alan Arkin (as a more-or-less depressed failed entrepeneur) and Clifton Collins Jr. (as a lovelorn cleaning supplies salesman) really stand out in this haphazard and disappointing attempt at ""indie quirkiness."" At times almost funny and at times almost touching, Sunshine Cleaning is ultimately neither, though it manages to present an interesting, though depressing, look at a family's reaction to death in the family.",2,Decent independent dramedy but not a knockout,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,1368,"['someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'love', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'second', 'sunshine', '-titled', 'film', 'same', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'eye', 'beginning', 'finally', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'few', 'good', 'recommendations', 'friends', 'have', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'mind', 'trailer', 'film', 'look', 'middling', 'dramedy', 'slightly', 'less', 'funny', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'what', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'decent', 'actress', 'received', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'acclaim', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'breakout', 'Junebug', 'enjoyable', 'here', 'script', ""n't"", 'give', 'audience', 'much', 'reason', 'support', 'character', 'painted', 'ex-head', 'cheerleader', 'still', 'sleeping', 'now-married', 'ex-boyfriend', 'high', 'school', 'working', 'cleaning', 'woman', 'hard', 'tell', 'design', 'accident', 'felt', 'equally', 'apathetic', 'towards', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'slightly', 'lazy', 'younger', 'sister', 'character', 'Only', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'more-or-less', 'depressed', 'failed', 'entrepeneur', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'lovelorn', 'cleaning', 'supplies', 'salesman', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'haphazard', 'disappointing', 'attempt', 'indie', 'quirkiness', 'times', 'almost', 'funny', 'times', 'almost', 'touching', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'ultimately', 'neither', 'present', 'interesting', 'depressing', 'look', 'family', 'reaction', 'death', 'family']",N/A
