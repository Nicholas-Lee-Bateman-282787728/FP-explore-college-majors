675404,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00005QJIG,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[8, 10]","This film was made without an actual script but instead grew out of improvisations from an actors' workshop.  I wish someone else would try this technique as it brings a fresh, immediate, quasi documentary feel to the whole work. I've long been looking for a bridge work between documentary and feature film and this may be it. The film is also character driven instead of plot driven because of this original premise.  It is an intense exploration of the underside of the women in the LA strip club scene but it could have been set anywhere. The actress who nails such a woman leading this life dead to rights is Jennifer Tilly.  You have never seen her in a role like this and would scarcely recognize her as the scheming Jim Carrey client from ""Liar, Liar"" or the woman with the voice worth killing in ""Bullets Over Broadway.""  Her character spins out of control as she finds herself pregnant and in no position to be so.  She has many brilliant scenes but my favorite is when she is in the waiting room at a medical clinic sitting next to an annoying goody two shoes who is an even more pregnant, obviously coddled suburban woman.  Tilly eventually blows up at this woman and ends with a hilarious closing line about her kid will end up selling ""goody's"" kid drugs on the playground some years hence.  In fact, if I had one quibble, it would be that I wish the entire film could have been Tilly's.  Everyone else does a fine job too but I think a lead, sole role by Tilly here could have been Oscar worthy.  Someone should give her a chance to show her full dramatic range again.",5,Improvisation Opens New Territory & Tilly Superb,1022544000,"05 28, 2002",2002,1583,"['film', 'was', 'made', 'actual', 'script', 'instead', 'grew', 'improvisations', 'actors', 'workshop', 'wish', 'someone', 'else', 'would', 'try', 'technique', 'fresh', 'immediate', 'quasi', 'documentary', 'feel', 'whole', 'work', ""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'looking', 'bridge', 'work', 'documentary', 'feature', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'also', 'character', 'driven', 'instead', 'plot', 'driven', 'original', 'premise', 'intense', 'exploration', 'underside', 'women', 'LA', 'strip', 'club', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'anywhere', 'actress', 'who', 'woman', 'leading', 'life', 'dead', 'rights', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'role', 'would', 'scarcely', 'recognize', 'scheming', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'client', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'woman', 'voice', 'worth', 'killing', 'Bullets', 'Broadway', 'character', 'control', 'pregnant', 'position', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'favorite', 'when', 'waiting', 'room', 'medical', 'clinic', 'sitting', 'next', 'annoying', 'goody', 'two', 'shoes', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'pregnant', 'obviously', 'coddled', 'suburban', 'woman', 'Tilly', 'eventually', 'up', 'woman', 'hilarious', 'closing', 'line', 'kid', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'selling', 'goody', 'kid', 'drugs', 'playground', 'years', 'hence', 'fact', 'had', 'one', 'quibble', 'would', 'be', 'wish', 'entire', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Tilly', 'Everyone', 'else', 'fine', 'job', 'too', 'think', 'lead', 'sole', 'role', 'Tilly', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Someone', 'should', 'give', 'chance', 'show', 'full', 'dramatic', 'range', 'again']",Dancing At The Blue Iguana

675407,A3N28SBSNVUR9X,B00005QJIG,David Grim,"[3, 4]","This portrayal of the lives of a group of strip-club employees works simultaneously on several levels.  Initially, I would be remiss if I didn't confirm the obvious expectation that the film is titillating.  There are no portrayals of sex, but there are plenty of scenes with scantily clad beautiful women.  But there is another less visceral side to the movie as well.  This film is the result of an improvisational process whereby the actors were empowered by the director to fill out its skeleton script.  Listen to the commentary for details.  Radford explains (often redundantly) the entire process in detail.But the movie also works as a fairly realistic cinema-verite slice-of-life piece about the lives of those on the periphery of the sex industry.  In fact, judging from the director's commentary and Darryl Hannah's documentary (included on the dvd), much research went into the details that make this film convincing.  Of course it doesn't all work.  It would be impossible considering the risks inherent in the improvisational process.  There is a subplot about one of the strippers and her relationship with her brother that is not quite carried off.  There are several scenes where minor characters seem to miss their marks.  On a few occasions the dialogue becomes stilted or meandering.  But overall this is a very enjoyable film with some strong performances.  This is an exceptionally good set piece for the talents of Darryl Hannah (talents in fact that I would have never foreseen).  Humorously, in one of her ad-libbed scenes, Hannah references Pulp Fiction, and how it revived John Travolta's career.  If the film industry were a just operation, then this film would lead to more opportunities for the much-maligned Hannah.",4,Who would have known?,1039564800,"12 11, 2002",2002,1746,"['portrayal', 'lives', 'group', 'strip-club', 'employees', 'simultaneously', 'several', 'levels', 'Initially', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'confirm', 'obvious', 'expectation', 'film', 'titillating', 'are', 'portrayals', 'sex', 'are', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'scantily', 'clad', 'beautiful', 'women', 'less', 'visceral', 'side', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'result', 'improvisational', 'process', 'whereby', 'actors', 'were', 'empowered', 'director', 'fill', 'out', 'skeleton', 'script', 'Listen', 'commentary', 'details', 'Radford', 'often', 'redundantly', 'entire', 'process', 'detail.But', 'movie', 'also', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'cinema-verite', 'slice-of-life', 'piece', 'lives', 'periphery', 'sex', 'industry', 'fact', 'judging', 'director', 'commentary', 'Darryl', 'Hannah', 'documentary', 'included', 'dvd', 'much', 'research', 'went', 'details', 'make', 'film', 'convincing', 'course', ""n't"", 'work', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'considering', 'risks', 'inherent', 'improvisational', 'process', 'subplot', 'one', 'strippers', 'relationship', 'brother', 'not', 'quite', 'carried', 'off', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'minor', 'characters', 'seem', 'miss', 'marks', 'few', 'occasions', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'meandering', 'overall', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'strong', 'performances', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'set', 'piece', 'talents', 'Darryl', 'Hannah', 'talents', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'foreseen', 'Humorously', 'one', 'ad-libbed', 'scenes', 'Hannah', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'how', 'revived', 'John', 'Travolta', 'career', 'film', 'industry', 'were', 'just', 'operation', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'lead', 'more', 'opportunities', 'much-maligned', 'Hannah']",Dancing At The Blue Iguana
675408,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00005QJIG,D. Mok,"[7, 16]","Dancing at the Blue Iguana and the disastrous B. Monkey combine to suggest that director Michael Radford's success with Il Postino was a fluke.Despite a good cast that includes Daryl Hannah, Charlotte Ayanna and the terrific Sandra Oh, Dancing... is a lumberous, uninspired look at a life in stripping.  What's achieved is not a documentary feel -- well-crafted documentaries, such as Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine, are deliberately paced and meticulously edited to tell their story efficiently.  Dancing... simply looks and feels unedited, events unfolding in excruciating real time.  What the actors talk about tends to ramble on and on as things tend to do in improvisations and unfortunately, Radford also chose to shoot many of these scenes in extended two-shots  allowing for no chance to compress scenes and move them along.  Add that to the ever-atrocious acting of Jennifer Tilly and too long a running time, and it's yet another &quot;stripper story&quot; without enough to say.It's too bad Radford didn't bother to look at his improvisational workshops and actually craft a sharp, well-thought-out script from what the actors bring to the table, because there are quite a few good performers in here.  They just needed thematic focus and better pacing, and without the guiding force of an overarching narrative, Dancing at the Blue Iguana simply rambles on.",2,"Thin, slow -- too much time for too little substance.",1029456000,"08 16, 2002",2002,1376,"['Dancing', 'Blue', 'Iguana', 'disastrous', 'B.', 'Monkey', 'combine', 'suggest', 'director', 'Michael', 'Radford', 'success', 'Il', 'Postino', 'was', 'fluke.Despite', 'good', 'cast', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'terrific', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Dancing', 'lumberous', 'uninspired', 'look', 'life', 'stripping', 'What', 'achieved', 'not', 'documentary', 'feel', 'well-crafted', 'documentaries', 'such', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'are', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'meticulously', 'edited', 'tell', 'story', 'efficiently', 'Dancing', 'simply', 'feels', 'unedited', 'events', 'unfolding', 'excruciating', 'real', 'time', 'What', 'actors', 'talk', 'tends', 'ramble', 'things', 'tend', 'do', 'improvisations', 'unfortunately', 'Radford', 'also', 'chose', 'shoot', 'many', 'scenes', 'extended', 'two-shots', 'allowing', 'chance', 'compress', 'scenes', 'move', 'along', 'Add', 'ever-atrocious', 'acting', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'too', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'yet', 'quot', 'story', 'quot', 'enough', 'say.It', 'too', 'bad', 'Radford', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'look', 'improvisational', 'workshops', 'actually', 'craft', 'sharp', 'well-thought-out', 'script', 'what', 'actors', 'bring', 'table', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'performers', 'here', 'just', 'needed', 'thematic', 'focus', 'better', 'pacing', 'guiding', 'force', 'overarching', 'narrative', 'Dancing', 'Blue', 'Iguana', 'simply']",Dancing At The Blue Iguana
675409,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B00005QJIG,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[4, 7]","Or a couple days.  This well-meaning film gives us a decent look as to what is probably a realistic view of the life of a stripper.  Unlike ""Striptease"", which takes a more comical view and tries to throw in some social issues as well, this one takes a more documentary-like approach to the subject.  While insightful, it doesn't match ""Striptease"" for total entertainment value.The big problem is that there is not much plot.  We see characterizations.  There is the wild, uncontrollable one who is headed for a crash-landing in life, especially when she finds she's pregnant and insists on smoking in the pre-natal doctor's office.  There is the nice, but very dumb one who thinks that just because she thinks kids are cute, would qualify as a foster parent even though the kids would be treated like cute stuffed animals.  There's the poet who shows her sadness on stage, and shows big reluctance when it comes to relationships.The movie also shows the very thin line to prostitution in the biz, and while stripping itself pays very well, going beyond that is even more lucrative, albeit with risks.  There is a hint at the tie to organized crime.  Of course drugs are all over the place, not only because the girls can afford them, but it either eliminates boredom or helps buffer the guilt some of them have about what they do.  Finally, there is the issue of overly possessive men, be it former acquaintances or customers.All of this is presented in a somber, realistic manner.  But maybe too somber.  And no real plot to tie it all together.  There is little joy shown in the lives of these women.  While I'm sure they are accurate portrayals of many types in the life, these are still young, good-looking women making a lot of money, and there has to be some degree of security in this.  ""Striptease"" might have shown an overly optimistic view of the life, but thousands of women make their living this way, and it can't be as bad as portrayed in this movie for all of them.On the ""eye candy"" front, very, very good.  We do get, among others, Darryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly, and the lady from ""Arliss"" all going down to their g-strings, and the views are generous.  The big star they bring in at the end is also a knockout.

675410,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005QJIG,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","How refreshing to see a film that is made as a group effort, that gives as much credibility to the Director (Michael Radford) as it does to the actors (Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly, Sheila Kelly, Charlotte Ayanna, Elias Kosteas, and Sandra Oh) and to the camera men, costumers, etc.  This is a tough slice of life to examine - the sordid existence of the women who work the strip joints in the San Fernando Valley - and the technique of using the improvisational style greatly enhances the feeling of reality.Each of the characters in this dark film were given enough information about their character to have an outline which they then fleshed out into the richly three dimensional characters we see on the screen.  This takes great courage on the part of a director, but given the quality of talent involved, the payoff is well worth it.  Sandra Oh gives a thrilling performance of a poet-by-day/stripper-by-night and finally has a venue for showing how richly talented she is.  Daryl Hannah turns in a wholly believeable bravura performance as a less than bright yet tender and near delusional young woman in search of a life that makes sense.  Jennifer Tilly gives an over the edge portrayal of a leather-type who perhaps holds more aching tenderness beneath her tough shell that she herself knows.  Sheila Kelly's character just smolders.  All of the actresses have the courage to 'bear it all' in the dance sequences and we can only applaud their commitment to Michael Radford's sense of style.This is a  much overlooked little movie that will probably surface in the art houses on a routine basis as a film ahead of its time.",5,A Daring Chance for All Involved..and It Works!,1035936000,"10 30, 2002",2002,1632,"['How', 'refreshing', 'see', 'film', 'made', 'group', 'effort', 'as', 'much', 'credibility', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Radford', 'actors', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'Sheila', 'Kelly', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'Elias', 'Kosteas', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'camera', 'men', 'costumers', 'etc', 'tough', 'slice', 'life', 'examine', 'sordid', 'existence', 'women', 'who', 'work', 'strip', 'joints', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'technique', 'using', 'improvisational', 'style', 'greatly', 'feeling', 'reality.Each', 'characters', 'dark', 'film', 'were', 'given', 'enough', 'information', 'character', 'have', 'outline', 'then', 'fleshed', 'out', 'richly', 'three', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'see', 'screen', 'great', 'courage', 'part', 'director', 'given', 'quality', 'talent', 'involved', 'payoff', 'well', 'worth', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'thrilling', 'performance', 'poet-by-day/stripper-by-night', 'finally', 'venue', 'showing', 'how', 'richly', 'talented', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'wholly', 'believeable', 'bravura', 'performance', 'less', 'bright', 'tender', 'delusional', 'young', 'woman', 'search', 'life', 'sense', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'edge', 'portrayal', 'leather-type', 'who', 'perhaps', 'more', 'aching', 'tenderness', 'tough', 'shell', 'herself', 'knows', 'Sheila', 'Kelly', 'character', 'just', 'smolders', 'actresses', 'have', 'courage', ""'bear"", 'dance', 'sequences', 'can', 'only', 'applaud', 'commitment', 'Michael', 'Radford', 'sense', 'style.This', 'much', 'overlooked', 'little', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'surface', 'art', 'houses', 'routine', 'basis', 'film', 'ahead', 'time']",Dancing At The Blue Iguana

In the ""making-of documentary, `Strip Notes',"" Hannah claims that the director gave the actors only the title of the film and its location, while ""everything else, the characters, the dialogue, and story lines had to come from our imagination."" First major mistake - making Darryl Hannah responsible for something potentially creative, poetic, and aesthetically viable such as a film! The director should have forced the majority of the cast (read: the strippers!) at gunpoint to take a year's worth of acting classes before ever being allowed to improvise or even stand before the camera.The film blows!Daryl Hannah as ""Angel"" is even worse here than in the Pope of Greenwich Village (if that's even conceivable). Yes, she's that bad! In ""Iguana"" she dominates the film, she's in nearly every other scene (not stealing scenes, you understand, but rather ruining them!). She pathetically attempts a dumber-than-dumb bimbo (loves children - with a good heart - and is also a stripper), whose supposed deep and enduring qualities will somehow tap into the spectator's pathos. Instead, and not at all surprising, she comes off as totally unbelievable, and beyond, utterly ridiculous. I was actually embarrassed for her while she was (attempting to) act (So in that way, I guess it's fair to state the following: ""On a positive note, her performance did move me!"").The film blows!Jennifer Tilly as ""Jo"" is a $#@*&%$ train-wreck! All she does is scream mindless lines at the top of her lungs in a tone and pitch that would make Sam Kinison cringe!The film blows!Sandra Oh as ""Jasmine"" is the most despicable of all the characters (poorly conceived, or ""imagined,"" and atrociously portrayed). All Oh does is scowl with the countenance of a grizzled and hardened street-wise chick (who is also, and get this, an aspiring and talented poet!). Come on, in the film her vocabulary is limited to four or five words, all expletives, and yet she writes deeply moving, heartfelt poetry - what a #@%&$*& joke! A bookstore is the last place you'd find this loser of a character. Sorry, the film fails categorically in its attempt to sell the character of Jasmine in terms of a ""tormented, soulful contradiction"" - wholly unbelievable, inconsistent, shallow, and vile, yes, I'll buy that, but a tormented, soulful contradiction, never!The film blows!Lastly, there's something of a subplot within the plot going on (I think, but I'm still not completely sure).

But the ""Blue Iguana"" makes us look behind the pasties, not to just the flesh, but to the real stories of these women.  Whether caustic and hard, crippled and soft, or just plain exhausted, Blue Iguana skillfully pulls us into places we might not otherwise go, and shows us how much we DON'T see. Most notable are Jennifer Tilly, (who is in my opinion the 21st century's Marilyn Monroe), and Sandra Oh.  Oh delivers a breathtaking and heartbreaking performance as Jasmine, an intelligent and talented poet who dances because the money's better than waitressing.  While it's definitely easier to believe the somewhat stereotypical Darryl Hannah character(Angel, the deadly gorgeous but warm-hearted dingbat), Jasmine embodies the range of possibilities for each of the characters, and for all of us.

675414,A1HUY0686X5LTU,B00005QJIG,"Kenton Wilson ""classic sci-fi geek""","[0, 0]","The movie was OK.  The plot was a little lame, but what can you do with a bunch of emotionally distraught strippers, other than a horror flick.  Beware that there is ample gratuitous nudity to go around (it is a movie about strippers set largely at a strip club.  I bought the movie because I had heard about how Darryl Hannah and the other actresses had worked so hard to learn how to perform exotic dances and was curious to see how accurate this information was.  I have always thought Darryl Hannah has portrayed some very sexy women in quite a few of her previous roles.  In this one she plays an extraordinarily dumb blonde, and she does that quite well, but her dancing wasn't anything special.  She definitely had been working out as evidenced by virually no body fat to be seen anywhere.  This made her look too anorexic.  Jennifer Tilley usually plays the dumb role, but in ""Dancing"" she played the self centered ""[...]"", and she over acted.  Shiela Kelley and Sandra Oh provided reasonable performances and their dancing looked more professional than Darryl Hannah's or Jennifer Tilley's dancing.  If you want to actually see quality exotic dancing (of which the name implies)performed by a woman with the stereotypical female physique, then you have to rely on Charlotte Ayanna and the brief appearance of Kristin Bauer.  Charlotte plays a young woman of relative intelligence(of who's age is questioned when she auditions for the job at the Blue Iguanna to ensure that she is of age) and is somewhat naive due to her youth.  She connects up with and then later gets physically abused by a friend (regular customer) of Darryl Hannahs.  Everything said, Charlotte's acting was ok, but let's face it, she has a voluptuous body and knows how to use it.  Kristin Bauer is hired to dance at the Blue Iguana late in the movie, because one of the dancer's gets killed and one gets fired.  This was probably the best decision made by the casting director.  Kristin plays a seasoned dancer and when she first shows up on screen, you think she has a snobbish, stuck-up attitude with the the other regular dancers.  A little later you discover that she has a serious drug problem when Darryl walks in on her shooting up heroin between her toes.  At that point, you realize that she was very stoned when she first appeared.  In her brief, appearance she proves to be friendly and the best thing is that she has a killer body and dances like she made a living stripping before she started acting.  The price of the movie was worth seeing her dance.Finally, if you would like to see Kristin Bauer and Charlotte Ayanna, two very sexy beautiful women, strip, this is the movie for you.

It mainly was sad showing how stripers were lonely using drugs to fill all the empty spaces, or men, or just plain dreams that never seemed to materialize. The acting was overall pretty good considering that this was all done without having an exact script. I was surprised to see some of the faces in the film, such as Daryl Hannah and Jennifer Tilly. These girls took on some really scary stuff, by getting up in a roomful of men and stripdancing. The dances were very intense and erotic and because I am a girl and was in an audience of mostly men I felt a little, no alot, uncomfortable. There were alot of dances with very little clothing because that was what the movie revolved around, unlike Striptease with Demi Moore, where there was I think maybe one or two times that she actually danced. This movie has endless dance sequences with all the major stars and some minor ones as well. There are also lap dances but they are not as intense as some I have seen in other art films. There was one movie I saw that had the most erotic lap dance ever, it was a movie called The Center of the World. These scenes in the Blue Iguana did not sizzle. But thats ok, I think the movie didn't want to show that side as much as it wanted to show how lost and unhappy these girls were. Some were just plain angry, trapped in a lifestyle they could not escape from. There were some beautiful poems in the film which enhanced the theme of the film. It is definately worth checking out, just be aware there is alot of female nudity!

675417,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00005QJIG,Paul McGrath,"[4, 6]","It is always a pleasure to come across an American film which, instead of showing people shooting each other or blowing things up, simply attempts to recreate in a truthful way a slice of life.  For that alone, I give this film all the credit in the world, but, despite the superb acting performances, the film is not completely successful.  For one thing, there is not much of a plot to speak of--much less a cohesive, unifying theme--and some of the scenes swerve dangerously close to being overly melodramatic.Nevertheless, the film is enormously successful in the way it portrays the Blue Iguana, a strip-joint somewhere on the outskirts of Los Angeles, and the down-and-out characters who inhabit it.  It looks like it got all of the details right.Jasmine, for example, runs into an enthusiastic bar patron on the outside.  Her parting epithet is, ""Stay high!""  This is exactly the kind of thing someone like her would say.  Another girl, also outside, gets sick on the sidewalk while her boyfriend, standing alongside, makes no effort to help her, ineffectually muttering, ""Are you all right?"" over and over again.  As glamorous as these girls are inside of the place, none of them look pretty or even make any effort to look pretty outside of it.  All of them smoke incessantly, carry a little flask of booze around with them, smoke dope regularly, and take pills.  Angel, in fact, spends the entire film wandering around in a drug-induced haze.  None are terribly bright or educated.  It becomes clear that all of them have very low self-esteem.The acting, from the larger to the smaller roles, is superb.  Darryl Hannah captures the vacant, hazy, innocent stupidity of her character perfectly.  Also excellent was the actress who played Neko, who onstage is a confident, powerful, strutting symbol of brazen sexuality, but who offstage is just an ordinary looking, chain-smoking, washed-out blonde;  hanging around the joint at 3:00am because she has nowhere else to go.  Robert Wisdom, as the club manager, brings a great deal of nuance to his role, one which could have easily sunk into stereotype.  He's so natural that it hardly seems like he's acting.The best performances though, are that of Jennifer Tilly and Sandra Oh.  You can say whatever you want about Jennifer Tilly, but this is an actress who is not afraid to take chances.  Her Jo is a loud, unattractive, crass vulgarian, constantly at war with her co-workers over respect she craves but which she will never earn.  She is not the kind of girl who sinuously purrs her way onstage, not her.  She is the one who stomps on stage, whooping it up.  Hers is not a complex role, but it nevertheless is a very demanding one, and she nails it.  It should also be noted that there are not a lot of actresses out there who would be willing to take on a role like this.  This is no ""Pretty Woman.""Sandra Oh is also magnificent as Jasmine, the pseudo-caretaker of these girls, as she is the one person among them with some common sense and a degree or two of intelligence.  In fact, outside of the place she attends poetry readings, and is even coerced into reading some of her own.  There is a superb moment of recognition on her face when her new-found boyfriend convinces her that he wants to kiss her because of her poetry.  It suddenly occurs to her that she can be seen by another human being as something more than a mere sex object.  She is a poet!But her moment of grace is fleeting, as her co-worker and then her boss drag her inexorably back to the dreary life she has lazily carved for herself.  Her last dance, done for the boyfriend poet, and to the beautiful Moby song with the refrain, ""This is goodbye,"" is absolutely heartbreaking.  (And would have been even more so without the tears.)But this scene is a good example of the overdone melodrama in the film also.  The movie would have you believe that this is the end of their relationship, but the fact is, life is not always this neat.  In real life, our lovesick poet would come mooning around after her--nobly trying to save her probably--or maybe she'd sneak back into one of his poetry readings.  And the subplot with the Russian hit man was way over the top.  Why drag a hit man into this?  Totally unnecessary.On the whole, though, this is a very entertaining and serious-minded look at one of the seamy elements of society, done in a way that does not glorify or grossly sentimentalize its subject.

675421,A26WVK274IA7DN,B00005QJIG,Sarah Bellum,"[28, 28]","Prior to watching this, I expected something on par with ""Striptease"" or ""Showgirls,"" which are films about stripping that also attempt to legitimize their titillation by tossing in dramatic subplots. Even with earnest intentions, films of this sort usually end up being clich&eacute;d and disappointing. Adding to my trepidation was the fact I had never heard of this film, which was released in 2000, prior to 2006. I finally took a chance on it and gladly admit that it really drew me in and convinced me to care about the characters. Like most people, these women only want to find love and something real in life, yet have lost their centers. Indeed, it is the actresses' portrayals of these characters that make each disappointment and set-back so painful to watch. Sandra Oh really moved me with her performance as Jasmine, a would-be poet who sabotages her own happiness because she has come to believe she cannot trust anyone, including herself. Her performance as a sensitive, intelligent person is the most tragic among these lives because she lacks the confidence to escape her current situation, even though she easily could. As Angel, Darryl Hannah is wonderful as a helplessly dim and hopelessly optimistic dreamer. (She also looks unbelievably fit!)  Jennifer Tilly is also very good as the out of control Jo, a woman who tries desperately to win in a man's world, but comes to realize the playing field is not level. Charlotte Ayanna is remarkable as Jessie, an eager to please naf, who has not yet had her spirit crushed by the weight of the world. Come to think of it, it does all sound very clich&eacute;d and there really isn't much of a plot to tie it all together, just several subplots. Nonetheless, the acting is exceptional, made all the more impressive by the fact much of it is improvised. (And yes, the ladies here all smoke, which would ostensibly account for their trim appearances) I enjoyed the entire two hours and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good character study without the hindrance of a plot. The DVD is quite decent, with a very good transfer, optional subtitles and some alternate scenes. This is a bargain for the price.",4,Smoke yourself thin,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,2176,"['Prior', 'watching', 'expected', 'something', 'par', 'Striptease', 'Showgirls', 'are', 'films', 'stripping', 'also', 'attempt', 'legitimize', 'titillation', 'tossing', 'dramatic', 'subplots', 'Even', 'earnest', 'intentions', 'films', 'sort', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'disappointing', 'Adding', 'trepidation', 'was', 'fact', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'released', '2000', 'prior', '2006', 'finally', 'took', 'chance', 'gladly', 'admit', 'really', 'drew', 'convinced', 'care', 'characters', 'most', 'people', 'women', 'only', 'want', 'find', 'love', 'something', 'real', 'life', 'yet', 'have', 'lost', 'centers', 'Indeed', 'actresses', 'portrayals', 'characters', 'make', 'disappointment', 'set-back', 'so', 'painful', 'watch', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'really', 'moved', 'performance', 'Jasmine', 'would-be', 'poet', 'who', 'own', 'happiness', 'come', 'believe', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'anyone', 'including', 'performance', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'person', 'most', 'tragic', 'lives', 'confidence', 'escape', 'current', 'situation', 'even', 'easily', 'could', 'Angel', 'Darryl', 'Hannah', 'wonderful', 'helplessly', 'dim', 'hopelessly', 'optimistic', 'dreamer', 'also', 'unbelievably', 'fit', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'control', 'Jo', 'woman', 'who', 'desperately', 'win', 'man', 'world', 'realize', 'playing', 'field', 'not', 'level', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'remarkable', 'Jessie', 'eager', 'please', 'naf', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'had', 'spirit', 'crushed', 'weight', 'world', 'Come', 'think', 'sound', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'tie', 'together', 'just', 'several', 'subplots', 'Nonetheless', 'acting', 'exceptional', 'made', 'more', 'impressive', 'fact', 'much', 'improvised', 'yes', 'ladies', 'here', 'smoke', 'would', 'ostensibly', 'account', 'trim', 'appearances', 'enjoyed', 'entire', 'two', 'hours', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'hindrance', 'plot', 'DVD', 'quite', 'decent', 'very', 'good', 'transfer', 'optional', 'subtitles', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'bargain', 'price']",Dancing At The Blue Iguana

675424,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,B00005QJIG,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[13, 13]","Dancing at the Blue Iguana is a film whose story was developed during a five month improvisational workshop run by director Michael Radford.  The story centers around the Blue Iguana, your average seedy strip club, this one located in a faceless semi industrial area of the San Fernando valley part of LA.  Each of the lead actors developed their own character and storyline based on their own research.There have been a couple of pathetic attempts by Hollywood to make a film about the world of strip clubs, namely Showgirls and Demi Moore's abhorrent Striptease, but both of those failed miserably.  Dancing at the Blue Iguana succeeds brilliantly.  Walk into any average to below average strip club in America and you'll find stories that are not at all dissimilar from the stories developed by the Blue Iguana's five dancers all played brilliantly by Darryl Hannah, Sandra Oh, Charlotte Ayanna, Shiela Kelly and Jennifer Tilly.The one story element that sticks out as overly fantastic is that of the Russian hit man played by Vladimir Mashkov, who because his target is being held for questioning by the FBI, is stuck in a hotel next to the club and falls for Darryl Hannah's character because he sees her smoking outside the club all the time.  But if you replace the Russian hit man with a businessman stuck in town for a week, it still makes sense, and would be much more believable.Robert Wisdom who plays Eddie, the owner of the club, and W. Earl Brown, who plays his right hand man, Bobby, both do a wonderful job in this movie as well.  The camera work is first rate and does a fantastic job capturing the unscripted dialogue.  The soundtrack is perfect for this film.In a film about strip clubs, there is obviously going to be a lot of nudity, and there is in this film, but it's not done in a gratuitous way.  The film also kind of starts and ends in the middle of each of the stories, but that's the way life is.  I found it just absolutely compelling and rivetting, in some sense the way a train wreck is compelling, because some of these young women have real problems.  I could have watched another two hours of this, though, it was that good.Strip clubs are often sad places, both the dancers and their customers often have melancholy tales. Dancing at the Blue Iguana captures that milieu in a perfectly downbeat way.
