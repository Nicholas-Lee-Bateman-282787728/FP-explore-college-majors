Since the film is really about trust, then why not just title the movie as Never Trust Strangers? Rebecca DeMornay gets her money's worth by appearing naked with her Spanish Latin lover co-screen star Antonio Banderas regardless the fact if she knew what she was getting into or not. Antonio Banderas helps make this film to be cringe-worthy. Harry Dean Stanton gives a very hammy performance as usual. Dennis Miller brings back the bad memories of Monday Night Football moments. It gets worse when I had to follow the story to the end. The F bomb got dropped by the time I see how the ending unraveled. This makes it all easy for me to give Never Talk to Strangers a rating of `1'. Peter Hall tries too much in his attempt to make the film look slick enough, and there are doses of poor camera work as well. Thinking of the initial meeting between Tony Ramirez and the psychologist, how implausible was that? And that was a dead giveaway that something is certainly up.

391197,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6303948049,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","This is a psychological thriller primarily involving four personalities that we learn about very slowly and find ourselves wondering very early which one(s) is the most disturbed. Rebecca De Mornay stars as psychologist Dr. Sarah Taylor and it opens with Dr. Taylor interviewing a vicious murderer as a servant of the court and she is to determine if the man is competent to stand trial. Dennis Miller plays a friend of Sarah's that lives in the same apartment building and he seems determined to have a deeper relationship with Sarah. From the moment he appears, the Miller character seems jealous and possessive.Sarah meets Tony, played by Antonio Banderas, in a supposedly chance encounter at a supermarket. Tony is a bit pushy in trying to get involved with Sarah; the viewer immediately questions whether the first meeting was by chance. Sarah's father appears unexpectedly outside her apartment and the viewer realizes immediately that she loathes him, yet no further information is given.Tony and Sarah develop their relationship with the Miller character appearing occasionally as an observer whose interest appears to be something other than benign. When someone begins stalking Sarah, the relationship action heats up and Tony demonstrates that he has some instability in his personality, sometimes exhibiting jealous rage, although with only mild violence that can be channeled into sex. Sarah is so frightened that she hires a private detective to follow Tony; her goal is to determine if he is the stalker. At this point, we have three prime suspects for the stalker, Tony, Sarah's father and the Miller character.At the end, there is a dramatic conclusion where we learn the dark secrets of Sarah's past with her father, who the stalker is and what Tony was actually doing. It is unexpected, although in the best thriller tradition, ample hints were dropped along the way. The final scene was one of extreme disingenuousness, the viewer is left with the thought that not everyone that will die is in fact dead yet.The scenes range from the sexually hot to the morbidly cold, together they make a thriller where very few people will be able to accurately determine what is really happening until they are told, which is the mark of the best of the psychological thrillers.",4,Great thriller with an unexpected and dark ending,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,2285,"['psychological', 'thriller', 'primarily', 'involving', 'four', 'personalities', 'learn', 'very', 'slowly', 'find', 'wondering', 'very', 'early', 'one', 's', 'most', 'disturbed', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Sarah', 'Taylor', 'Dr.', 'Taylor', 'interviewing', 'vicious', 'murderer', 'servant', 'court', 'determine', 'man', 'competent', 'stand', 'trial', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'friend', 'Sarah', 'same', 'apartment', 'building', 'determined', 'have', 'deeper', 'relationship', 'Sarah', 'moment', 'Miller', 'character', 'jealous', 'possessive.Sarah', 'meets', 'Tony', 'played', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'supposedly', 'chance', 'encounter', 'supermarket', 'Tony', 'bit', 'pushy', 'trying', 'get', 'involved', 'Sarah', 'viewer', 'immediately', 'questions', 'first', 'meeting', 'was', 'chance', 'Sarah', 'father', 'unexpectedly', 'apartment', 'viewer', 'immediately', 'yet', 'further', 'information', 'given.Tony', 'Sarah', 'develop', 'relationship', 'Miller', 'character', 'appearing', 'occasionally', 'observer', 'interest', 'be', 'something', 'other', 'benign', 'When', 'someone', 'stalking', 'Sarah', 'relationship', 'action', 'up', 'Tony', 'instability', 'personality', 'sometimes', 'exhibiting', 'jealous', 'rage', 'only', 'mild', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'channeled', 'sex', 'Sarah', 'so', 'frightened', 'private', 'detective', 'follow', 'Tony', 'goal', 'determine', 'stalker', 'point', 'have', 'three', 'prime', 'suspects', 'stalker', 'Tony', 'Sarah', 'father', 'Miller', 'character.At', 'end', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'where', 'learn', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Sarah', 'past', 'father', 'who', 'stalker', 'what', 'Tony', 'was', 'actually', 'doing', 'unexpected', 'best', 'thriller', 'tradition', 'ample', 'hints', 'were', 'dropped', 'way', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'extreme', 'disingenuousness', 'viewer', 'left', 'thought', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'die', 'fact', 'dead', 'yet.The', 'scenes', 'range', 'sexually', 'hot', 'morbidly', 'cold', 'together', 'make', 'thriller', 'where', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'accurately', 'determine', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'are', 'told', 'mark', 'best', 'psychological', 'thrillers']",Never Talk to Strangers VHS

There are a few steamy scenes, too.The bad news is that there are no likable characters, too much profanity; a few minor holes in the story; and an obvious as sexist bias against men.

Rebecca DeMornay (Risky Business, Trip to Bountiful) plays a repressed psychiatrist who is evaluating alleged serial killer Harry Dean Stanton to see if he should stand trial for his accused crimes.  Stanton claims he is a multiple personality disorder victim and therefore can plead innocent due to insanity.  DeMornay has a chance encounter with sexy Antonio Banderas and starts into a relationship with him.  This alienates her best friend Dennis Miller who has been carrying a torch for DeMornay for some time.  DeMornay starts receiving strange things in her mail:  dead flowers, her dead cat, etc., etc., and soon it seems DeMornay may be the victim herself of a dangerous stalker.  Is it Banderas? Miller? or perhaps even her estranged father (Len Cariou).  Once all the secrets are peeled away, things aren't quite what they seem.  While definitely not in the league of truly suspenseful films, NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS offers a sharp performance from DeMornay and Cariou particularly, and Banderas is effectively smoldering.
