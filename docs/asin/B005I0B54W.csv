1461637,A1ZYA1450LWBXF,B005I0B54W,Amazon Customer,"[8, 8]","At one time, a few years ago, we used to yearn for DVDs on arms. And no one would produce any! There were two or three and no single DVD seemed to satisfy everybody. Today it's a different picture. There's a variety to choose from. I have to say from the outset that I would not choose this DVD. Not because it isn't good, but because it isn't based on my favorite style of moves. It's all very Egyptian (If I've got that right) and even set to music that usually makes me leave town. Not my style, not my style. But I know other dancers would choose this video for that very reason. So I'll set aside how I personally feel and pen down my impressions. This is not a review in the real sense of the word, because I've only watched and not actually used the DVD - and I will not be.Another group of dancers this video is NOT for is absolute beginners. It really is about taking arm work to another level by fitting it right into the dance, not about the basics. Since the arm work is combined heavily with actually dance moves, you have to know your basic belly dance. More than know it. You have to be someone who's well into dancing. I'd say intermediate-advanced. There will be no explaining what a maya is or how to do a turn or a shimmy. You've got to come to this video with all that pretty much down pat.This whole DVD is full of the type of moves that go with a big fluffy skirt that you can use as muh as you do your own body. Lots of those Egyptian high kicks - that kick and lean back to push up your upper body move - lots of turns with their associated sweepy arm moves, and lots of balance moves. There are passes and kicks sprinkled all over. The arm work is not general purpose and pretty-pretty. Neon's Body Language of Belly Dance would be in that category. So would Bozena's Arm Flow belong in the same category. But this video is unique and almost specialized.The preliminaries involve posture and a quick section on frames. This isn't about your usual first position, second position but about some typical frames that go with the moves to come along with something on how to transition to them. It's a short but informative section.Also countable among the preliminaries is a small spell of wrist circles, hand undulations and then snake arms. At this point I was wondering what was the big deal about this video anyway. Actually Ruby could have even eliminated this whole bit, though you need some way to get into the arm work - you can't very well have a DVD with a middle and end and no beginning. Still, it wasn't the best explanation or run through I've seen of either wrist circles or snake arms. It was also at this time that I found myself comparing what Ruby was doing with Bozenka's arm work, not because they're directly comparable but because I've just seen that DVD very recently. Bozenka's is a DVD more suited to beginners, definitely. But the poise of the two dancers is quite starkly different - on the DVDs. I don't know how they compare in general performances and who's considered the better dancer, but Ruby, whom I thought looked wonderfully poised in other DVDs didn't seem to that graceful on this one. But again, that's my subjective impression. As they say ""just sayin"".The arm pathways are the real meat of the video and  must say, they're very meaty indeed. There are altogether thirty pathways (I didn't count but Ruby said so) and instead of each being a separate bit you can get to from the menu, they're gathered in bunches to fit into three dance formats: slow dancing, finger cymbal moves, and drum solo. Each of these makes a solid separate section with sub sections to explain the basic moves, string them into a combo which is explained, a run-through of the combo with counts (no music yet), practice with music, and finally dancing the combo. That's quite a bit of break down but you really need it as these combos are not easy. Unless you're a pro at Egyptian.Slow performance pathways are introduced with some impressive tips. Just to tell you one of them: because you're exposed for longer periods, you tend to protect yourself with more closed arm moves. And that's a mistake. Open up to make more expansive moves that'll draw the audience in not close you off. And expansive moves is what you'll do here - lots of arm sweeps, circles, hair combs, arms up to trail down, barrel turn arms, etc. These are not the pretty nuanced emotive type of moves. Unfortunately I happen to prefer those. But anyway, these are arm moves that will almost echo the large movements of a full skirt. There's about as much footwork to do as there s arm work - and that's one of things that's unique about this video. Lots of explanations and tips throughout. I've already described how the instruction is broken up.You may be surprised, in the finger cymbals section, to see no sign of zills till the end. The thing is, the combo is long and complex. There's just a whole lot to do and while some may want to approach t by using the zills right from the start, Ruby doesn't take that route. I can see why. This isn't about teaching you the basics of finger cymbals and nor is it showing you how to layer basic arm work with zills. It is what it looks like - a big combo into which zills come in. What do you learn? Well, zill-typical arm work! You will probably find something similar only in a choreography video, not one on just zills or just arms.The moves in the zills section are also sweeps, head roll with arm circles, cross over turns with arms, etc. The combo is again long and involves no end of kicks and balance steps and turns, jumps, drops, hair tosses. I'm a hundred percent sure I wouldn't be able to do it.It's a solid combo, almost a little choreography, and it'll give you lots to work on for a whle. The zills come in towards the proactive, with no zill explanations except for the counts written on the screen. How you're going to look at the screen while you're turning is up to you!The drum solo moves also start with excellent tips. For example, you need to pay special attention to no-hesitation moves with your arms else there'll be a very strange difference between sharp hip work and accents, and uncertain looking arm work. That's a great and critical tip! In learning drum solos, one probably focuses much more on the other moves and not the arm work whch is an afterthought. What Ruby says makes sense because you need to put enough work into the arm work as well.The drum solo combo is also very complex. It's about half a choreography worth of stuff. I'm really thinking they may as well have done full usable ones, but perhaps that's not the objective.Again, get your balance in order because one-leg moves are used in this mini choreography - and with a drum solo, you could quite easily topple over if you decide to get enthusiastic on one foot!Phew. There's just a lot of work on this DVD and it can be enough to keep you quite busy. Because of the extensive explanations it would have been difficult to replay the video, but because there are separated practice sessions, working with it again is more easily done.There's an arm strengthening drill added to the contents here. Exercises with weights that I'm familiar with because I do work with light weights very often. And then there's an ""Arm Puzzle"". And I think I should leave that unsaid so that anyone who wants to buy the video can at least be surprised about some part of the instruction.Of course, the mandatory (though they all call it bonus) performance is at the end and it does include many of the moves taught and even some of the combos.I'd give this video a 5 for the amount of content it has, all put together with a lot of hard work. But Ill reserve the right to lop a point off because I hate each of the moves. It's clearly not for everybody and that bit of a waring needs to come in somewhere.",4,Challenge your arms,1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,7848,"['one', 'time', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'used', 'yearn',

In class I am so focused on what my feet and hips are doing that my arms are just sorta hanging out there. This video is invaluable. I like the angle of the filming so I can follow from the back which makes it clearer which is left and which is right.  I also like that the pathways all lead to a full combo that is practiced many times over. My favorite section was the drumsolo.  I would love to see Ruby do an entire video on drum solo. I'm not big into the barrel rolls and turns. And if I have one complaint about the DVD it's that her arms are almost the same color as the wall.

I was totally prepared for yet another skinny minnie to show me the Egyptian Walk, but I was so pleasantly surprised to find Ruby well versed in other genres of belly dance (Turkish).  Her presentation of the lessons were very articulate and contained information for both the beginner (but not a complete beginner...you must have some knowledge of the dance or you cannot execute these moves) and the seasoned dancer.  If you are a seasoned dancer and you do not find anything useful on this DVD, then perhaps YOU should consider teaching.  I have a VAST collection of belly dance videos from a host of top notch dancers, but in my opinion, this one far outweighs the others in every aspect.One reader claimed the video quality was poor; however, I completely disagree.  Ruby presented the lessons in front of a full length mirror so you could see every angle; the lighting was more than efficient, the instruction was detailed and broken down in easy to follow steps, and the practice sessions both with music and without was a huge bonus!I loved everything about this video and if I had to make one negative comment, it would be the performance piece...and only because the lighting was a bit poor in this section, but it took nothing from the instructional sections.I will certainly be looking for more from Ruby and will purchase every one!",5,All About Arms: Frames and Flourishes for Better Belly Dancing,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,1393,"['Honestly', 'video', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'was', 'totally', 'prepared', 'yet', 'skinny', 'minnie', 'show', 'Egyptian', 'Walk', 'was', 'so', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'Ruby', 'well', 'versed', 'other', 'genres', 'belly', 'dance', 'Turkish', 'presentation', 'lessons', 'were', 'very', 'articulate', 'contained', 'information', 'beginner', 'not', 'complete', 'beginner', 'must', 'have', 'knowledge', 'dance', 'can', 'not', 'execute', 'moves', 'seasoned', 'dancer', 'are', 'seasoned', 'dancer', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'useful', 'DVD', 'then', 'perhaps', 'YOU', 'should', 'consider', 'teaching', 'have', 'VAST', 'collection', 'belly', 'dance', 'videos', 'host', 'top', 'notch', 'dancers', 'opinion', 'one', 'far', 'others', 'aspect.One', 'reader', 'claimed', 'video', 'quality', 'was', 'poor', 'however', 'completely', 'disagree', 'Ruby', 'presented', 'lessons', 'front', 'full', 'length', 'mirror', 'could', 'see', 'angle', 'lighting', 'was', 'more', 'efficient', 'instruction', 'was', 'detailed', 'broken', 'down', 'easy', 'follow', 'steps', 'practice', 'sessions', 'music', 'was', 'huge', 'bonus', 'loved', 'everything', 'video', 'had', 'make', 'one', 'negative', 'comment', 'would', 'be', 'performance', 'piece', 'only', 'lighting', 'was', 'bit', 'poor', 'section', 'took', 'nothing', 'instructional', 'sections.I', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'looking', 'more', 'Ruby', 'will', 'purchase', 'one']",All About Arms: Frames and Flourishes for Better Belly Dance

I look at this video as an opperating dictionary. Very nice job. This video has a bit of stiffness in its poses, but I think it is necessary for dancers who are unable to keep their hands and arms still when they need to.
