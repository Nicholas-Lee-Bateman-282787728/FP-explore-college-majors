Their humor is very strange, somewhat disgusting, and they both like to dress as women.  But somehow they pull it off and have created a uniquely entertaining series.  The live show that this is is not as ""elegant"" as their TV series due, most likely, to having to please an audience.  Still, it is a good addition to the previous 3 series if you've been jonesing for a hit.",4,You either love them or snicker politely...,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,444,"['Little', 'Britain', 'one', 'oddest', 'shows', 'come', 'Atlantic', 'humor', 'very', 'strange', 'somewhat', 'disgusting', 'dress', 'women', 'somehow', 'pull', 'off', 'have', 'created', 'uniquely', 'entertaining', 'series', 'live', 'show', 'not', 'elegant', 'TV', 'series', 'due', 'most', 'likely', 'having', 'please', 'audience', 'Still', 'good', 'addition', 'previous', '3', 'series', ""'ve"", 'been', 'jonesing', 'hit']",Little Britain Live
