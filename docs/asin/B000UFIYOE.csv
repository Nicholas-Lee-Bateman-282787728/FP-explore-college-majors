After watching `The March of the Penguins'March of the Penguins (Widescreen Edition)and `Happy Feet'Happy Feet (Full Screen Edition)I thought I'd been all penguin-ed out.  I mean how much could they do with the novelty of having penguins surfing?  The film wasn't what I was expecting--a good thing.  Sporting a ""Mockumentary"" the film has the advantages of feeling both real and random at the same time.  Not as delightful as 'Happy Feet,' 'Surf's Up' is still a `Toon with a `tude with a solid story to go along the weird concept.Featuring Cody Maverick (forever young Shia LaBeouf), the mockumentary  chronicles the genesis of a young surfer penguin dude.  Citing his idol ""The Big Z, Zeke,"" the Laird Hamilton of the penguin surf world, (Jeff Bridges whose contribution made me think of 'The Big Lebowski' without knowing 'til the credits it was him.) Cody sets out to learn his craft and training of the surf art.  His father and mother have their misgivings.  His mother being the worrier; the father the doubter.  Hooking up with fellow surfer, Chicken Joe (cast perfectly as 'Napoleon Dynamite' star Jon Heder) and meeting his rival in overweight bully Tank Evans (here again Diedrich Bader is a perfect catch), he must get ready for a Hawaiian contest sponsored by Reggie Belafonte (the Don King of penguin surfers) and covered by SPEN (well, the ESPN of the penguin sports' world) make for a mutant coloration of what we've seen so far.Four screenwriters contribute, and directors Chris Buck and Ash Brannon and editor Ivan Belancio ensure the formula stays fresh and new.  Episodic the film delves into adolescent psyches wanting to be inspired ""To be able to do it myself"" while also having figures to look up to.  (Tony Hawke also comes to mind.)  With a progressive score featuring the likes of Green Day and some artful surf shots, 'Surfs Up' avoids any run-of-the-mill undertow one might expect.",3,"""Cowabunga, Dude!""",1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,1961,"['Watching', 'previews', 'Surf', 'Up', 'sighed', 'watching', 'March', ""Penguins'March"", 'Penguins', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Happy', ""Feet'Happy"", 'Feet', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'thought', ""'d"", 'been', 'penguin-ed', 'mean', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'do', 'novelty', 'having', 'penguins', 'surfing', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'good', 'thing', 'Sporting', 'Mockumentary', 'film', 'advantages', 'feeling', 'real', 'random', 'same', 'time', 'Not', 'as', 'delightful', ""'Happy"", 'Feet', 'Up', 'still', 'Toon', 'tude', 'solid', 'story', 'go', 'weird', 'concept.Featuring', 'Cody', 'Maverick', 'forever', 'young', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'mockumentary', 'chronicles', 'genesis', 'young', 'surfer', 'penguin', 'dude', 'Citing', 'idol', 'Big', 'Z', 'Zeke', 'Laird', 'Hamilton', 'penguin', 'surf', 'world', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'contribution', 'made', 'think', ""'The"", 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'knowing', 'credits', 'was', 'Cody', 'out', 'learn', 'craft', 'training', 'surf', 'art', 'father', 'mother', 'have', 'misgivings', 'mother', 'being', 'worrier', 'father', 'doubter', 'Hooking', 'up', 'fellow', 'surfer', 'Chicken', 'Joe', 'cast', 'perfectly', ""'Napoleon"", 'Dynamite', 'star', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'meeting', 'rival', 'overweight', 'bully', 'Tank', 'Evans', 'here', 'again', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'perfect', 'catch', 'must', 'get', 'ready', 'Hawaiian', 'contest', 'sponsored', 'Reggie', 'Belafonte', 'Don', 'King', 'penguin', 'surfers', 'covered', 'SPEN', 'well', 'ESPN', 'penguin', 'sports', 'world', 'make', 'mutant', 'coloration', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far.Four', 'screenwriters', 'contribute', 'directors', 'Chris', 'Buck', 'Ash', 'Brannon', 'editor', 'Ivan', 'Belancio', 'ensure', 'formula', 'fresh', 'new', 'Episodic', 'film', 'adolescent', 'psyches', 'wanting', 'be', 'inspired', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'also', 'having', 'figures', 'look', 'up', 'Tony', 'Hawke', 'also', 'mind', 'progressive', 'score', 'featuring', 'likes', 'Green', 'Day', 'artful', 'surf', 'shots', 'Up', 'avoids', 'run-of-the-mill', 'undertow', 'one', 'might', 'expect']",N/A

First of all, Surf's Up is rated PG. A PG rating means this movie is targeted at people 10 and up.Second, who says all animated films are automatically supposed to be kid-centric just because they're animated? Animation shouldn't be stuffed into a 'kids only' box. Adults should be able to enjoy animation too. The first animated feature-length film, Snow White, was NOT directed at children. It was made primarily for adults, as were its immediate successors, Pinocchio, Fantasia and Bambi.Many animated films these days are going in a more 'family' direction and trying to be enjoyable for adults as well as kids. Surf's Up is one of those. And some reviewers did say their kids loved it... so it would seem kids have different tastes just like adults do. Whoa, novel concept!Anyway... I watched this with three adults: my husband and two friends. We loved EVERY SINGLE MINUTE of this film... which was a pleasant surprise for me; I expected to find it 'pretty' good, but instead we all thought it was, in surfer-speak, ""WAY awesome, Dude!!""The animation in this is absolutely GORGEOUS, the dialogue (much of it improvised) and acting were superb, and the plot was fresh and original. We were laughing at least twice a minute through the whole thing, and then the ending surprisingly had me slightly choked up.

1094861,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000UFIYOE,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Okay, I love penguins.  I think they are the cutest little things I have ever seen.  That said with the onslaught of penguin movies lately I was initially really excited, and then I saw them and I was less than impressed.  To be completely honest I hated `Happy Feet' and that was such a downer for me because I wanted it to be my favorite cartoon based on subject (and character) alone.  Alas, while `Surf's Up' is not my `favorite' cartoon it is leagues ahead of `Happy Feet' in the entertainment department and deserves any amount of attention it can muster.  It's funny and fresh and delivers where its `happy' predecessor failed miserably.The cartoon follows wannabe surfer Cody Maverick, a young hotshot who idolizes the late Big Z, a master of the surf.  Cody, moved by a chance encounter with the celebrity before his death, has entered a surfing competition where he hopes to become the next Big Z.  His path to the gold though is not without roadblocks, the biggest of which is Tank Evans, conceded superstar surfer who crushes all within his path, including young children.  When Cody gets injured he is brought to the home of recluse Geek who nurses him back to heath and the two of them help each other to finally reach what they've always dreamed.It's a cute little movie that serves up laughs as well as adventure, and while it's not a deep movie it's memorable.  It's a cartoon after all, and who really wants their cartoons loaded down with hidden messages and political propaganda?  We just want to be entertained, and `Surf's Up' does just that.Shia LaBeouf is having one heck of a year, with `Transformers' and `Disturbia' launching his career as well as this little ditty added to his r&eacute;sum&eacute;.  Some people are made for voice over work (look at Bruce Willis, Ashton Kutcher and the brilliant Robin Williams, who in my opinion should be in EVERY cartoon) and some need to stay away (see Nicole Kidman for starters).  Shia LaBeouf works wonderfully here.  Jeff Bridges is immediately recognizable as Geek and Zooey Deschanel is effective but nothing special as Lani.  It's Jon Heder and James Woods that steal the show though.  Jon Heder's funny starts with his voice anyways so it's no wonder that he would crack plenty of smiles with his take on Chicken Joe.  James Woods (sounding a bit like Billy Crystal here) is also electric as Reggie Belafonte.The animation isn't as `advanced' as maybe `Happy Feet' was but `Surf's Up' has much broader appeal and will please many more than it's bland penguin predecessor.  Having it filmed like a documentary adds to the humor found within `Surf's Up'.  If you want a good ol' fashioned animated good time then sit back and take it all in.",4,"Finally, a penguin movie worth getting excited over...",1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,2714,"['Okay', 'love', 'penguins', 'think', 'are', 'cutest', 'little', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'said', 'onslaught', 'penguin', 'movies', 'lately', 'was', 'initially', 'really', 'excited', 'then', 'saw', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'hated', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'was', 'such', 'downer', 'wanted', 'be', 'favorite', 'cartoon', 'based', 'subject', 'character', 'alone', 'Alas', 'Surf', 'Up', 'not', 'favorite', 'cartoon', 'leagues', 'ahead', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'entertainment', 'department', 'amount', 'attention', 'can', 'muster', 'funny', 'fresh', 'delivers', 'where', 'happy', 'predecessor', 'failed', 'miserably.The', 'cartoon', 'wannabe', 'surfer', 'Cody', 'Maverick', 'young', 'hotshot', 'who', 'late', 'Big', 'Z', 'master', 'surf', 'Cody', 'moved', 'chance', 'encounter', 'celebrity', 'death', 'entered', 'surfing', 'competition', 'where', 'become', 'next', 'Big', 'Z', 'path', 'gold', 'though', 'not', 'roadblocks', 'biggest', 'Tank', 'Evans', 'conceded', 'superstar', 'surfer', 'who', 'path', 'including', 'young', 'children', 'When', 'Cody', 'injured', 'brought', 'home', 'recluse', 'Geek', 'who', 'back', 'heath', 'two', 'help', 'other', 'finally', 'reach', 'what', ""'ve"", 'always', 'dreamed.It', 'cute', 'little', 'movie', 'up', 'laughs', 'as', 'well', 'adventure', 'not', 'deep', 'movie', 'memorable', 'cartoon', 'who', 'really', 'cartoons', 'loaded', 'down', 'hidden', 'messages', 'political', 'propaganda', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'Surf', 'Up', 'just', 'that.Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'having', 'one', 'heck', 'year', 'Transformers', 'Disturbia', 'launching', 'career', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'ditty', 'added', 'r', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'people', 'are', 'made', 'voice', 'work', 'look', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'brilliant', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'opinion', 'should', 'be', 'EVERY', 'cartoon', 'need', 'stay', 'away', 'see', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'starters', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'wonderfully', 'here', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'immediately', 'recognizable', 'Geek', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'effective', 'nothing', 'special', 'Lani', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'James', 'Woods', 'steal', 'show', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'funny', 'starts', 'voice', 'anyways', 'wonder', 'would', 'crack', 'plenty', 'smiles', 'take', 'Chicken', 'Joe', 'James', 'Woods', 'sounding', 'bit', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'here', 'also', 'electric', 'Reggie', 'Belafonte.The', 'animation', ""n't"", 'advanced', 'maybe', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'was', 'Surf', 'Up', 'much', 'broader', 'appeal', 'will', 'please', 'many', 'more', 'bland', 'penguin', 'predecessor', 'Having', 'filmed', 'documentary', 'humor', 'found', 'Surf', 'Up', 'want', 'good', 'ol', 'fashioned', 'animated', 'good', 'time', 'then', 'sit', 'back', 'take']",N/A

The water was mesmerizing, the image so beautiful, I could hardly wait to watch it with the kids.When we saw Happy Feet, I was excited to finally see that beautiful penguin movie. Or so I thought. What I saw instead was a bunch of penguins singing Prince songs, among other things. Warner brothers was showing off its music catalog with Happy Feet, but I don't know what they were doing as far as movies go. That was a jumbled mess with Robin Williams playing like 5 characters and a bunch of loopy tap dancing numbers. Savion Glover looks like a street person in the scary special features section too. That loopy Prince song playing in the credits messed me up man. I kept shaking my head to erase that bad trip.Based on an ancient cartoon about an opera singing papa owl with an `Owl' Jolson son, Happy Feet is a fish out of water story. Sort of. Then there's a weird plot line about finding the aliens who polluted the water and got rid of the fish, and then the deal about the penguins can communicate by tap dancing, and how that even catches man's attention. And they all get fish! I think. Because by that point I was gone. Couldn't. take. it. any. longer!I was still shuddering weeks later when Surf's Up appeared in the mail. I saw the beautiful water, but I was still muttering ""I can't believe!"" under my breath. I mean, Happy Feet! It looked so promising!Then the movie started. It was like a documentary. I laughed, and continued laughing for the whole movie. It hit me about half-way through that this was the movie with the beautiful water we'd seen previewed at Blockbuster.Surf's Up was just so funny. And cute. And what a great story. I don't want to give any more away. Buy it, immediately! Then tell me how right I am.The kids didn't know how bad Happy Feet was until they saw Surf's Up. Their brows furrowed as the wave of realization hit them. All penguin movies are not alike!They couldn't discern as much when the comparison was between Finding Nemo and Shark's Tale. They had actually prefered the ghetto alternative mess to the timeless classic. They're all too young to catch the nuances of difference between Bug's Life and Antz and Ant Bully.But Surf's Up and Happy Feet?

An animated reality film crew (all you see of them is the occasional mike boom, scene opening placard, etc., follows Cody Maverick, a young surfing penguin in this mockumentary on his quest to break away from the monotony of life in Antarctica and follow his dream of becoming a big-wave surfer.  It all began when he was a young penguin and ""Big Z"", the most famous of the old-school big-wave surfers, went on a world tour and popularized surfing around the globe.  Years later Cody gets his break when a surfing talent scout recruits him as he scours the globe for surfers to participate in the 10th annual ""Big Z Memorial"" surf contest.I am a fan of animated films (though not really anime), e.g., Pixar, Disney, etc.  And this film is as good as any of those.  It has top-notch animation, great talent (Shia LaBeouf, Zooey Deshanell, Jeff Bridges, John Heder...), and a fun storyline.Cody is over his head when he tries to ride his first true big-wave, and is lucky to survive.  He then meets ""Big Geek"" a reclusive penguin who lives in the middle of the jungle on the island where the contest is being held.  You'll have to watch the movie to see what happens next, but I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed.There's not a disappointment through the entire show.

The settings and background were very lush and detailed and the ocean scenes, sunsets and waves were all rendered fantastically well. There's one scene at the end where the young penguin finally gets to go ""in the tube"" that mystical experience that all surfers long for where you are actually inside the wave, with the water rising up as a wall beside you and arching over your head, completely encasing you in an enchanting microcosm of water and light. And this looked great in 3-D! It really enhanced it. I saw the movie first in 3-D then went back and watched it regular to compare. There was no comparison, the scene and the visuals are much more powerful in 3-D. At least to me.This is really a coming of age story. The usual ""young man finding his own path and strength"" type movie. It's done so well you don't even notice they're penguins half the time. But there's also loads of laughs. Chicken Joe is worth seeing this movie for all by himself. He's your typical, mellow, surfer dude. Even down to the slouch and the language. But unlike most TV ""dudes"" he's not at all irritating. In fact, he's wonderfully funny. He's so calm and unruffled that he even takes being kidnapped by cannibals in stride. (And rememeber, he ""tastes like chicken"") But he's a great friend, and his adventures alone in the jungle are hysterical.The one group of people who also contribute greatly to this movie, are one's you never see, the camera crew. They follow Cody and Chicken Joe around all over the place ""filming"" for posterity. And they come in for their own portion of abuse in the antics they are observing. Even the cameraman is not immune to cannibals. And a lot of their ""off camera"" comments are totally funny.This was a good hearted, thoughtful, feel good movie, mixed in with lots of pratfalls, goofy takes and unlikely adventures that keep it fun for the kids and the young at heart. The scenery is beautiful, the characters are diverse (they're not all penguins) and the surf culture background is well researched, even down to giving some of the penguins Hawaiian tattoos.It's those kind of details that make it great. Definitely worth a watch. (Warning! You may never get your younger kids to STOP watching it.) And definitely see it in 3-D, it adds a lot. This is not just another Happy Feet (another great movie that you should also see in 3-D, very cool.) The two movies are far apart in tone, but should definitely sit side by side on your shelf.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 6]","Sony Pictures is keeping pace with the other giants of the animation industry: Pixar (recently releasedRatatouille) and Dreamworks (new release THE BEE MOVIE starring Jerry Seinfeld's voice). In fact, I'd dare say that SURF'S UP may top these other two simply by the nature of its filming technique.Whereas animation has made technical leaps and bounds over the past two decades, it has not, however, done much to improve the rather bland storytelling that comes with it (`desperate hero struggles, fails, gets back up, tries again, succeeds, marries the hot chick, end of story'). And although Surf's Up slips into this cliche, it does it in a most unique fashion that helps one forget that we're seeing the same old story again.This time we get an animated mockumentary (who ever thought of this should get a serious pat on the back!) Handheld camera movements. Star interviews. Kids' commentary. It's all there. The story is that of Cody (Shia LaBeouf,Transformers), a surfboard loving penguin stuck in Antarctica ...until he's selected to compete in a world championship against surfing giant Tank Evans (Diedrich Bader,Balls of Fury). Cody fell in love with surfing after his little frozen home was visited years before by then surfing phenom Big Z (Jeff Bridges,Tideland). Unfortunately Big Z died catching a huge wave and was lost forever. Or was he?Once at the competition, Cody realizes he's way out of his league. Tank is bigger, stronger, more talented, and perhaps too infatuated with his trophies? With buddy Chicken Joe (Jon Heder,Napoleon Dynamite) at his side, Cody and he soon run into the beautiful Lani (Zooey Deschanel,Failure to Launch), a penguin lifeguard that immediately infatuates Cody. After saving Cody's life, Lani introduces him to her uncle Geek. It doesn't take long for Cody to realize that Geek is Big Z, hiding away in the tropical forest of the island and securely away from the water/beach. Hero-worship turns to anger turns to friendship as Big Z helps Cody as much as Cody helps Big Z.The story is similar to all animated ones, but the documentary-style filming gives Surf's Up a bump up on the success scale. It's funny and not entirely for young kids. There are peeing jokes, poop jokes (including the word ""crap""), and some violent scenes that might turn off some parents. Still, it's original enough to get a big thumbs up and funny enough for adults and teens.(For another fantastic animated feature I highly recommendHoodwinked, an independent film that is sure to please kids and adults alike, too.)",4,Sony Beating Pixar And Dreamworks In Originality?,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,2545,"['Sony', 'Pictures', 'keeping', 'pace', 'other', 'giants', 'animation', 'industry', 'Pixar', 'recently', 'releasedRatatouille', 'Dreamworks', 'new', 'release', 'THE', 'BEE', 'MOVIE', 'starring', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'voice', 'fact', ""'d"", 'dare', 'say', 'SURF', 'UP', 'may', 'top', 'other', 'two', 'simply', 'nature', 'filming', 'technique.Whereas', 'animation', 'made', 'technical', 'leaps', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'not', 'however', 'done', 'much', 'improve', 'rather', 'bland', 'storytelling', 'desperate', 'hero', 'struggles', 'fails', 'back', 'up', 'tries', 'again', 'hot', 'chick', 'end', 'story', 'Surf', 'Up', 'cliche', 'most', 'unique', 'fashion', 'one', 'forget', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'again.This', 'time', 'get', 'animated', 'mockumentary', 'who', 'ever', 'thought', 'should', 'get', 'serious', 'pat', 'back', 'Handheld', 'camera', 'movements', 'Star', 'interviews', 'Kids', 'commentary', 'there', 'story', 'Cody', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Transformers', 'surfboard', 'loving', 'penguin', 'stuck', 'Antarctica', 'selected', 'compete', 'world', 'championship', 'surfing', 'giant', 'Tank', 'Evans', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'Balls', 'Fury', 'Cody', 'fell', 'love', 'surfing', 'little', 'frozen', 'home', 'was', 'visited', 'years', 'then', 'surfing', 'phenom', 'Big', 'Z', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Tideland', 'Unfortunately', 'Big', 'Z', 'died', 'catching', 'huge', 'wave', 'was', 'lost', 'forever', 'was', 'Once', 'competition', 'Cody', 'way', 'league', 'Tank', 'bigger', 'stronger', 'more', 'talented', 'perhaps', 'too', 'infatuated', 'trophies', 'buddy', 'Chicken', 'Joe', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'side', 'Cody', 'soon', 'run', 'beautiful', 'Lani', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'penguin', 'lifeguard', 'immediately', 'Cody', 'saving', 'Cody', 'life', 'Lani', 'uncle', 'Geek', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Cody', 'realize', 'Geek', 'Big', 'Z', 'hiding', 'away', 'tropical', 'forest', 'island', 'securely', 'away', 'water/beach', 'Hero-worship', 'turns', 'anger', 'turns', 'friendship', 'Big', 'Z', 'Cody', 'as', 'much', 'Cody', 'Big', 'Z.The', 'story', 'similar', 'animated', 'ones', 'documentary-style', 'filming', 'Surf', 'Up', 'bump', 'up', 'success', 'scale', 'funny', 'not', 'entirely', 'young', 'kids', 'are', 'peeing', 'jokes', 'poop', 'jokes', 'including', 'word', 'crap', 'violent', 'scenes', 'might', 'turn', 'off', 'parents', 'Still', 'original', 'enough', 'get', 'big', 'thumbs', 'up', 'funny', 'enough', 'adults', 'teens', 'fantastic', 'animated', 'feature', 'highly', 'recommendHoodwinked', 'independent', 'film', 'sure', 'please', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'too']",N/A

1094875,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000UFIYOE,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","""Surf's Up"" definitely achieves its goal in being a cute and generally enjoyable animated film, something that both children and (possibly) adults will get a kick out of. But to be perfectly honest, I got much more from the film's look than from its story; the color palate was bright, vibrant, and bold, effectively bringing to life a completely imaginary world in which computer generated penguins compete in surfing competitions. As the title suggests, water is prominently featured, and I give the animators a lot of credit for making every wave, ripple, splash, and spray seem realistic. There's a great shot near the end of the film in which the main character surfs underneath a cresting wave (which is apparently called a tube in surfer lingo); this shot is from his point of view, giving the audience a momentary chance to experience the power and majesty of water.It helps that the story is told in the style of a documentary, with an ever-present camera crew following the characters around for interviews and candid moments. It was a refreshing, unique way to tell such a simple story. It also enhanced the realism of many scenes, no small task considering how highly fantastic the film is (the idea of penguins living on a tropical island is quite original, if a little far fetched). Even the subtleties, such as tip of the boom-operated microphone peaking into the shot, effectively bring the story that much closer to reality. At times, it might have been too effective; I eventually paid more attention to the details than to the overall film. Example: the female lead is a lifeguard who uses a red squid as a buoy. The squid was a funny, fascinating nuance; its priceless eye expressions had me wondering what its everyday life could possibly be like.Despite such unique details, the basic themes and characterizations of the plot are fairly routine--about as predictable as any story about an underdog trying to prove something. It tells of Cody Maverick (voiced by Shia LaBeouf), an Antarctica-born teenage penguin who dreamed of becoming a professional surfer ever since meeting his idol, Big Z. His lucky break comes when a feathered talent scout (Mario Cantone) arrives on the back of a whale; he's recruiting surfers for an annual contest held on the tropical island of Pen Gu. Naturally, Cody jumps at this opportunity, not only because loves surfing, but also because he's tired of being picked on by his unsupportive family. His journey, as such journeys often do, will instill the values of friendship, patience, selflessness, and release.Does this not sound like a story you've seen and heard many times before? The characterizations alone are tried and true, especially when it comes to the secondary characters. The most important of these is Big Z (Jeff Bridges), who has since gone into hiding and is believed to be dead by the locals. For ten years, he only kept in contact with his niece, Lani (Zooey Deschanel), a lifeguard (mentioned above), Cody's would-be love interest, and Z's personal clam deliverer. Going by the alias Geek, he proves to be more mysterious and aloof than Cody expected. Why has his idol turned his back on surfing? Why has he disappeared from public view? Is he really someone to look up to? The answers to these questions may not surprise you; with very few exceptions, character development in an animated film is notoriously well established.This goes double for the villain--or more accurately, the one character that gives Cody the most trouble. His name is Tank Evans (Diedrich Bader), an overwhelmingly arrogant competitor who knocks other surfers off their boards, does pushups over hot coals, and gives female names to his trophies. This is, we soon discover, a facade hiding the possibility that he's a timid mama's boy. What an interesting balance. If only that angle had been played up a bit more--one-dimensional villains are never as compelling as complex ones, even in animated films. As you might expect, he believes that winning is everything, and he certainly has no qualms about not winning the tournament.The most entertaining side character is Chicken Joe (Jon Heder), the comedy relief in every sense. Paradoxically, this also makes him the most tiring side character; he's spacey and mellow, with a voice inspired by the perpetually stoned. It was only funny for the first couple of scenes. After that, I began to wonder if anything significant would have been lost without this character (aside from an amusing encounter with a tribe of chicken-hungry penguins). In all likelihood, I'm being too harsh; comedy relief is a pleasing if completely necessary inclusion in such films. Still, something about this character didn't sit well with me. Maybe it's the fact that he served no real purpose other than to be a silly distraction. This is such a lighthearted story, so much so that a silly distraction is unnecessary.But what do I know? As a whole, ""Surf's Up"" succeeded in what it set out to accomplish, and I have to give credit for that. The story is simple, fun, and endearing, pretty much as I expected it would be. The characters are cute and humorous. It looks and feels absolutely right, with environments rendered with extreme care and precision. It was also nice to once again be immersed in a penguin-ruled fantasy world, much like ""Happy Feet."" But this time the fantasy goes even further; the surfers hang six instead of ten.",4,Riding a Wave of Fun,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,5422,"['Surf', 'Up', 'definitely', 'goal', 'being', 'cute',

1094876,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000UFIYOE,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[5, 19]","If ""Happy Feet"" was the class act of animated penguin movies, and to me there is no doubt, then ""Surf's Up"" is the class clown. Not out for glory or respect or cash (though it would take any if offered), it is just there for a laugh. Of course this movie barely deserves to be mentioned along the superb ""Happy Feet"", but that is not to say that I didn't enjoy myself when I went to see it. The story involves Cody, your average animated main character fare, cool in a conformist kind of way and rebellious in a responsible kind of way. He leaves behind his family and the arctic and travels to warmer climates in hopes of breaking into the surfing biz. The real reason to see this movie, however, is for their idea to have it filmed in documentary fashion. This process gives the storytelling all sorts of new freedoms. The camera becomes a character itself (not unlike ""Cache"") following Cody to places where an animated camera rarely goes. We watch as Cody squabbles with his mother and later as he gets pushed around by the steamroller (and villain of course) of the penguin surfing world, Tank. I felt tinges of guilt and excitement watching these scenes as I forgot for a moment that everything in front of my eyes was decidedly not real.After an impressively funny opening act the film loses a step and is never able to recover. The movie becomes less about the documentary being filmed and more about just being conventional to the core. They throw you something of a curveball about halfway through, although I was out ahead of it by about five minutes. Other than that the middle section sags under the weight of its own cuteness. Baby penguins playing adorable, some comic relief named Chicken Joe who is really just a Jar Jar Binks knockoff, Zooey Deschanel . . .I could go on. Jeff Bridges was halfway to hilarious with his rendition of the Zen Master/all knowing quack who tries to teach Cody the ways of the world. They also would have benefited from having somebody a tiny bit younger compile the soundtrack. I love the New Radical's song too, but I also loved it in high school, and sad to say but I'm getting old.I figure the number one reason this film is not doing that great at the box office is because of its humor. Since it doesn't rely on the usual poopy jokes that American animation films do they were forced to find their laughs with more sophisticated ideas. So while it lampooned our reality TV craze, our hypocritical treatment of animals, and our ideas of what counts as entertainment nowadays the soccer moms in the audience probably just shrugged their shoulders. . .and then rushed out to tell other soccer moms not to see it. It is too bad because while I can't recommend this film I applaud it for breaking the mold and trying something new. . .not that that is ever a good idea, financially speaking. ***",3,Animation Verite,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,2842,"['Happy', 'Feet', 'was', 'class', 'act', 'animated', 'penguin', 'movies', 'doubt', 'then', 'Surf', 'Up', 'class', 'clown', 'Not', 'glory', 'respect', 'cash', 'would', 'take', 'offered', 'just', 'laugh', 'course', 'movie', 'barely', 'be', 'mentioned', 'superb', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'story', 'Cody', 'average', 'animated', 'main', 'character', 'fare', 'cool', 'conformist', 'kind', 'way', 'rebellious', 'responsible', 'kind', 'way', 'family', 'arctic', 'travels', 'warmer', 'climates', 'hopes', 'breaking', 'surfing', 'biz', 'real', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'however', 'idea', 'have', 'filmed', 'documentary', 'fashion', 'process', 'storytelling', 'sorts', 'new', 'freedoms', 'camera', 'character', 'not', 'Cache', 'following', 'Cody', 'places', 'where', 'animated', 'camera', 'rarely', 'watch', 'Cody', 'mother', 'later', 'pushed', 'steamroller', 'villain', 'course', 'penguin', 'surfing', 'world', 'Tank', 'felt', 'tinges', 'guilt', 'excitement', 'watching', 'scenes', 'forgot', 'moment', 'everything', 'front', 'eyes', 'was', 'decidedly', 'not', 'real.After', 'impressively', 'funny', 'opening', 'act', 'film', 'step', 'never', 'able', 'recover', 'movie', 'less', 'documentary', 'being', 'filmed', 'more', 'about', 'just', 'being', 'conventional', 'core', 'throw', 'something', 'curveball', 'halfway', 'was', 'out', 'ahead', 'five', 'minutes', 'Other', 'middle', 'section', 'sags', 'weight', 'own', 'cuteness', 'Baby', 'playing', 'adorable', 'comic', 'relief', 'named', 'Chicken', 'Joe', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'knockoff', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', '.I', 'could', 'go', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'was', 'halfway', 'hilarious', 'rendition', 'Zen', 'Master/all', 'knowing', 'quack', 'who', 'teach', 'Cody', 'ways', 'world', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'having', 'somebody', 'tiny', 'bit', 'younger', 'compile', 'soundtrack', 'love', 'New', 'Radical', 'song', 'too', 'also', 'loved', 'high', 'school', 'sad', 'say', ""'m"", 'getting', 'old.I', 'figure', 'number', 'one', 'reason', 'film', 'not', 'doing', 'great', 'box', 'office', 'humor', ""n't"", 'rely', 'usual', 'poopy', 'jokes', 'American', 'animation', 'films', 'do', 'were', 'forced', 'find', 'laughs', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'ideas', 'So', 'lampooned', 'reality', 'TV', 'craze', 'hypocritical', 'treatment', 'animals', 'ideas', 'what', 'entertainment', 'soccer', 'moms', 'audience', 'probably', 'just', 'shrugged', 'shoulders', '.and', 'then', 'rushed', 'out', 'tell', 'other', 'soccer', 'moms', 'not', 'see', 'too', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'applaud', 'breaking', 'mold', 'trying', 'something', 'new', 'ever', 'good', 'idea', 'financially', 'speaking', '***']",N/A

I got sick and tired with penguins after Happy Feet, and now with Surf's Up, I couldn't stand these characters, either (especially Cody Maverick). I would've admired them if the humor was just a little bit more enticing. The plot is what you would expect in a lightweight family film, except that it doesn't seem to be enough. There weren't enough creative elements in the story that would have made this film a tremendous comedic spectacle. I give credit to this film for not taking itself too seriously, but I believe more should have been added.But this movie is not a total loss.

1094889,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B000UFIYOE,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[2, 3]","I was dubious about this movie to begin with.  First of all I had a bad taste remaining from a previous computer animated penguin movie, the exquisite but execrable Happy Feet, which combined brilliant animation and a so-so plot with a sledgehammer to the forehead environmental message and an out-of-nowhere slam against Christianity that appeared to be based on nothing more than the filmmakers' prejudices.  Second, I had received a free, promotional ticket to see it yesterday, and I have never received a free, promotional ticket to a movie I'd pay money to see...until now.If there is any message toSurf's Upbeyond every sports movie cliche you've ever seen, which the filmmakers unearth in order to poke gentle fun at them, it is to never forget that surfing is supposed to be FUN.  The film-long running gag is that this is supposed to be a shoe-string behind-the-scenes documentary of the Penguin World Surfing Competition and its new star, Cody Maverick.  Thus we get grainy old film excerpts along with overly slick parody SPEN coverage spotted throughout everything-that-can-go-wrong-does-go-wrong documentary footage.  Though there IS a ""dramatic"" story going on here, it never goes on for too long before the ubiquitous cameraman blunders back into the story.  (The second film-long running gag is the technical screwup or the hurt-the-camera bit.)A quick and funny bit about the beginnings of penguin surfing is followed by the story of Cody's beginnings (and driving motivations): deceased before he could even remember him father, harried and misusunderstanding mother, pompous and bullying older brother, working class neighborhood (Shiverpool) that looks at a surfing enthusiast as an addled shirker, we understand clearly Cody's quiet desperation to get out of town and follow his dream, inspired at an early age by a promotional tour meeting with then reigning world champ, Big Z, in whose memory the world championship event was named.Unfortunately the arrival of the talent scout bearing whale coincides with a dead flat calm, but Cody will not be denied, first surfing the departing whale's wake, then franticly swimming alongside, until Chicken Joe, the stereotypical so-laid-back-he's-horizontal surfing bum of a, yes, chicken, from of all places Lake Michigan, helps him aboard and befriends him as the barely functional neurotic of a talent scout finally relents, because Cody's desperation ""was entertaining, in a horrifying sort of way.""Soon they arrive at the site of the competition where Cody and Joe immediately run afoul of reigning world champ Tank Johnson who takes the stereotype of the selfish, bullying, winning-is-everything-losing-is-nothing champ and runs it straight into the ground... and out the other side of the Earth.  Badly injured and humiliated in a one-on-one impromptu challenge match with Tank (the sea urchin Cody steps upon is interviewed to get his side of the story), Cody is rescued by lifeguard Lani and turned over for care to her dissipated uncle, the Geek, who is not quite what he seems.

It was marked when it first came out as yet another ""penguin movie"", although it kinda made fun of the fact that there was already about 2 or 3 other movies with nature's most perfect waterfowls in it. Hell, it was a step up from Pebble & The Penguin! This was created by Sony Pictures Animation who later did Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, and you can see how their direction improved from this movie.The movie is done like a documentary for an unknown network for animals(kinda like Animalympics)that is covering a surfing contest named after the dead surfing penguin, Big Z. Cody Maverick is a short but determined surfer from Antarctica who is major fan of Big Z, and makes his way into the contest, which takes place on the tropical island of Pen Gu. He makes friends with fellow surfer, a chicken from Wisconsin named Joe, plus the cute penguin lifeguard Lani. Cody's main competition is Tank, the champion of the last few years, and the one who defeated Z in his final surf. Cody ends up loosing in a challenge to Tank, and Lani takes him to a hermit, who Cody figures out is really Z. He faked his own death in his last match because he felt threatened by Tank, and was tired of all the fame that came with being a big surfer. Z tries to get Cody to get his confidence back by helping him to make a new board. With a little cohersion from Lani, Cody gets his groove back, and re-enters the contest. He, Tank, and Joe are the finalists, but Cody sacrifices his chance to win by stopping Tank from knocking out Joe, so Joe ends up winning. Z has to save Cody from some reefs, in so revealing himself to the masses. However, Z convinces the other surfers to do surfing just for fun, so Cody and the other have a big party at the end of the movie.I'd say that this was an enjoyable send up of surfer movies, without it pulling in alot of tropes and stereotypes. The voice acting was a seller too, with Shia LaBeouf almost paroding himself as Cody, Jon Heder(Napoleon Dynamite)is great at the clueless Joe, and Jeff Bridges(""The Dude"")is awesome as Z. The animation is pretty impressive too, matching the positive surfing scenes with the funny animal motifs.

But the fact that this animation decided to take a different approach made this movie different enough to be enjoyable.This movie is a lot like the television show The Office, a mockumentary.  It is where the characters pretend to doing real-world things in front of a reality TV camera when, in fact, it is all just comedic acting.  This new approach added a lot of freshness to these same ol' stories.The basic premise is about a kid (a kid penguin) who doesn't care about anything in life except for surfing, even to the neglect of his family, responsibilities, and the life that surrounds him.  He takes advantage of an opportunity to make it to the big time, like his hero in Life 'Z', but finds out more about what is really important to him along his journey and his path in life.The funny parts are mostly the ""interviews"" where people are being asked questions like a reality TV show and then they say the most unexpected things.  I normally wouldn't find this funny, because it is all scripted, but again it is this different approach that makes it fun and interesting.The voice talent is pretty good and I think they did a great job of finding the right voices for each character.  James Woods is the highlight to me thought Shia LaBeauf, Jeff Bridges, and Jon Heder do a great job in their individual rolls.One of the highlights of this movie is the sound track.

I went to this past weekend under duress, but I did so because my kiddies had been a very good this week in order to earn thier viewing.This movie probably sounds awful: a computer-animated surfing penguin movie but guess what...  I discovered was that I actually enjoyed this movie more than that other animated penguin movie. There is no singing or dancing. In fact, there is a joke in reference to it. Instead the movie is told from a mockumentary style, and if any of you have watched the behind the scenes documentary style shows on ESPN, you'll get a real kick out of the film just for that aspect.It also really loves the sport of surfing. It's not taken to a comic level, where through a bad script written by a surfing novice would make it seem childish and ignorant. Out of the multiple screenwriters on this project, at least a couple of them knew more than a thing or two about surfing and have infused a natural sense of the sport into the dialog and general feel of the flick.The voice performances are great as well. Shia LeBeouf provides the voice of Cody Maverick, the young penguin surfer dude who's a real know-it-all when it comes to what he's so certain that he knows what he can do. I don't think LeBeouf has done any other voice performances, but he was cut out for this stuck-up little bird and is PERFECT for it.Jeff Bridges does the voice for the old surfing guru, doing a bit of a spin on his Big Lebowski character, The Dude. He's laid back and yet very funny in his delivery of lines. The humor has some creatively subversive moments and made me and the other adults in the audience giggle after the kids were done giggling at the parts that were intended for them.""Surf's Up"" offers nuanced and energetic penguins, as well as top-notch CGI.

Surf's Up really makes itself stand on it's own, it truly is an individual in the penguin movie crowd.  It doesn't NEED to ride on Happy Feet's coattails, it creates its own beautiful world and really stays strong throughout the (sadly short) film.I was struck with how beautiful the scenery was, and how alive every character was.  It's completely fantastic how real and believable everyone is, and that is thanks to the documentary style, without a doubt.  The documentary style is a true asset to this film's heart and soul.

Sure there's silly ""surfer dude"" humor, but it's not overused.  But more importantly, the movie has detail and subtlety across the board.  Examples?  The mock documentary feel of the film allowed the animators to periodically insert very clever ""historic footage"" of famous surfers of years past, first in scratchy black & white then in that Super-8 grainy color stock (they really made it look like that!) we older viewers remember from home movies in the pre-video era.  These ""old clips"" were really clever and fun.Then I was delighted at discovering how the actors and producers used improvised, overlapping, Altman-esque dialogue throughout the movie, instead of a hard and fast script like most animated films (the generous special features confirmed this creative decision; the producers wanted the actors to ""run with the ball"" and take the characters where they wanted to take them). This dialogue approach definitely gave the move a more real, organic feel.Visual details throughout the main body of the film are amazing, too: some of the beach scenes are bright and sunny, but others have an overcast feel with a slight mist in the air, just like, well... real beaches look sometimes.  And all the expertly-rendered scenes with the ocean, the big waves, and the surfing are dramatic and awe-inspiring.Finally, the story has subtle, intelligent things to say about friendship, hope, the pitfalls of ambition, and other interpersonal subjects.  Yep, I'm talking about this movie about surfing penguins!Do yourself a favor: if you avoided ""Surf's Up"" in theaters because (like me) you thought it would be a silly effort that pandered to kids, definitely check it out on DVD.",5,"Yes, there are too many animated penquin movies... but don't miss this one",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,1757,"['Surf', 'Up', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'goofy', 'trailer', 'suggested', 'would', 'be', 'Sure', 'silly', 'surfer', 'dude', 'humor', 'not', 'overused', 'more', 'importantly', 'movie', 'detail', 'subtlety', 'board', 'Examples', 'mock', 'documentary', 'feel', 'film', 'allowed', 'animators', 'periodically', 'insert', 'very', 'clever', 'historic', 'footage', 'famous', 'surfers', 'years', 'first', 'scratchy', 'black', 'white', 'then', 'Super-8', 'grainy', 'color', 'stock', 'really', 'made', 'look', 'older', 'viewers', 'remember', 'home', 'movies', 'pre-video', 'era', 'old', 'clips', 'were', 'really', 'clever', 'fun.Then', 'was', 'delighted', 'discovering', 'how', 'actors', 'producers', 'used', 'improvised', 'overlapping', 'Altman-esque', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'instead', 'hard', 'fast', 'script', 'most', 'animated', 'films', 'generous', 'special', 'features', 'confirmed', 'creative', 'decision', 'producers', 'wanted', 'actors', 'run', 'ball', 'take', 'characters', 'where', 'wanted', 'take', 'dialogue', 'approach', 'definitely', 'gave', 'move', 'more', 'real', 'organic', 'feel.Visual', 'details', 'main', 'body', 'film', 'are', 'amazing', 'too', 'beach', 'scenes', 'are', 'bright', 'sunny', 'others', 'have', 'overcast', 'feel', 'slight', 'mist', 'air', 'just', 'well', 'real', 'beaches', 'look', 'sometimes', 'expertly-rendered', 'scenes', 'ocean', 'big', 'waves', 'surfing', 'are', 'dramatic', 'awe-inspiring.Finally', 'story', 'subtle', 'intelligent', 'things', 'say', 'friendship', 'hope', 'pitfalls', 'ambition', 'other', 'interpersonal', 'subjects', 'Yep', ""'m"", 'talking', 'movie', 'surfing', 'penguins', 'Do', 'favor', 'avoided', 'Surf', 'Up', 'theaters', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'silly', 'effort', 'pandered', 'kids', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'DVD']",N/A

1094905,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000UFIYOE,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 1]","Ever since the documentary ""March of the Penguins"" captivated audiences in 2005, it seemed that Hollywood just couldn't get enough of the loveable creatures, at least in animated form. One year after the aforementioned documentary was released, some audiences delighted to the musical/dance themed animated movie ""Happy Feet"". This brings us to the 2007 release of ""Surf's Up"", which served as a different kind of animated fare for the tuxedoed creatures. The reason being is that it was more of a sports themed mockumentary of sorts that focuses on penguins (go figure) who love to spend their days surfing. It's a surprisingly original idea, and one that grabbed my attention more effectively than any of the other penguin-centric movies being released, not to mention the terrific voice cast (which I will grant ""Happy Feet"" boasted great vocal performers as well), and what appeared to be a more fast-paced, fun, and less politically motivated movie than some of the other entries of its kind.""Surf's Up"" is the tale of a young penguin named Cody Maverick (Shia LaBeouf) who dreams of one day competing in a surfing contest named for his idol, surfing legend Big Z (Jeff Bridges). After gaining acceptance into the competition, Cody quickly discovers that his quest for winning may just be more difficult than he thought, and that the only way for him to truly become a winner is to learn that sometimes winning isn't everything.After watching the tiresome ""Happy Feet"" I wasn't looking forward to yet another movie focusing on the flight-less birds that Hollywood had suddenly become enamored with. However, upon viewing ""Surf's Up"" I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually enjoyed the movie from start to finish. I think the reason I enjoyed this movie more than expected is partly (perhaps obviously) due to the writing team of Don Rhymer (""Big Momma's House 2""), Ash Brannon and Chris Buck (who also served as directors on this movie) being smart enough to keep the movie just a fun ride for both children and adults. For every slapstick moment or age-appropriate joke for children, there would most likely be a sight gag or double entendre slipped in for adults to get a kick out of as well. As a parent I am always very appreciative of a so-called ""kid's movie"" that actually takes into account the fact that the target audience will most likely be accompanied by their parents or some other adult guardian; thus, these prescient writers take the effort to actually include some jokes aimed solely at those members of the audience above the age of 10.Giving life to the animated characters on the screen was a rather talented ensemble of actors and actresses. Shia LaBeouf seems to break out an early version of his quick-witted, fast-talking character of Sam Witwicky from ""Transformers"" to create his character of Cody. For the most part Shia seemed the ideal choice for the young, somewhat arrogant surfer wannabe; however, there were a few instances where his voice just didn't seem to fit together with the character's mannerisms, causing the vocal performance to feel slightly disconnected from the action onscreen. This problem could have been a hiccup in the voice-over process, because if memory serves correctly during those moments it almost sounded as if his voice was echoing for no obvious reason. Whatever the case may be, the problem wasn't massive, and it didn't detract too much from the movie, it was just something I thought should have been caught in the editing process of the final film.Along with Shia we have Jeff Bridges (""Iron Man""), Jon Heder (""Napoleon Dynamite""), and Zooey Deschanel (""Yes Man"") voicing the various friends that Cody meets along the way to the competition. Jeff Bridges' character of Big Z sounds like a distilled version of his character ""The Dude"" from ""The Big Lebowski"", but since the target audience of this movie would be too young to have seen that film, there's no harm in reproducing the character once more for another role; not to mention that character's speech pattern, attitude, and general approach to his daily life makes for an ideal fit for Big Z. Jon Heder offers the majority of the big laughs, mostly for the kids though, as Chicken Joe. Joe is... well, he's a chicken, as the name suggests, who hails from Michigan and hopes to be recognized as one of the surfing greats among his fellow penguin competitors. Thankfully, Jon didn't seem to bring any of his annoying Napoleon Dynamite attributes to this film, which was a good thing for me since I despised his work in the aforementioned comedy bore. Rounding out the primary supporting cast members we have Zooey Deschanel as a penguin lifeguard overseeing the competition. Zooey isn't given a whole lot to do in the movie, but she is granted a few moments of the spotlight to spout off some rather cute and funny one-liners. One other cast member of note would be James Woods (""Hercules"") who plays a Don King-esque promoter (complete with wild, stand-up straight hair) for the competition. His role isn't very large, and truthfully comes off as a glorified cameo in the end, but Woods' trademark fast-talking, schmoozing nature is a perfect fit for the character, and is a dead-on ringer for the animal kingdom's answer to Don King.Even with the necessary inclusion of a talented voice cast, every animated movie must also employ top-notch animation to fully flesh out the characters movements, mannerisms, and quirks on the big screen. The talented crew of Sony Pictures Animation really did an excellent job with their second feature film (the first being the lackluster ""Open Season"") of bringing such a strange idea of penguins going surfing to life. From the characters to the environments to the surfing action, everything about the production looked terrific to the point that it's quite hard to find something to really single out as being outstanding or innovative. Although I must say that there is one nice touch that sets this computer animated movie apart from most others; the use of an older film stock appearance employed for some of the semi-flashback sequences gave the mockumentary style a more realistic feel, given that old film footage is used so frequently in almost every single documentary, especially sports-themed ones.While ""Surf's Up"" was nothing more than just another case of a Hollywood studio jumping onto whatever bandwagon is popular at the time, it is arguably the best entry from that fad for audiences to enjoy. A good story that was wise enough to include both kids and adults in on the jokes, a talented cast, great animation, and a novel concept to make a mockumentary style children's movie elevates ""Surf's Up"" well above its competition in every way.""Surf's Up"" is rated PG for mildly crude humor.",4,Penguins Love Surfing...

This is a story about determination, motivation, the importance of friendship, standing up against the odds and going all-out after your dream.  It's a great story for kids.  I occasionally like to nourish my own inner child and also to see what movies are teaching our children (even though my child is 35.)  This is a penguin story and is a take-off of the ""Happy Feet"" character types.When Cody Maverick was just a little pengie, he met ""Big Z,""  the all-time best of the penguin surfers, the really big Kahouna.  Big Z took the time to speak to little Cody and to give him a Big Z surfer pendant and told Cody about the importance of not giving up and going after your dreams.  Little Cody was very impressionable and Big Z's words and gesture so motivated Cody that they stuck with him all his life.  Cody grows up determined to be just like Big Z, even after Big Z disappears in a big wave.Now, Cody is a 17-year old teenage penguin super-surfer dude.  He lives with mom and older brother.  Dad was eaten by a whale some years ago, as is fairly common with penguin dads.  The older brother is very negative but Cody does not let the sarcasm deter him.  Through sheer determination, Cody sets out to win the big surfer contest at the Big Z Memorial Surfing Event.This story also helps illustrate how important a gesture it is when a celebrity does something positive for someone.  Because a celeb is already so much in the public's eye, a kind act can go very far in encouraging others.  Celebs are role models for many kids.  I'm glad to see it when they are positive role models.

Whether they are sitting on eggs, singing and dancing, or, in the case of this movie, surfing through rocks and waves, penguins just can't seem to do anything wrong these days.  I admit, I wasn't looking forward to seeing ""Surf's Up.""  The idea of watching a movie about surfing penguins seemed to have as much entertainment potential as the idea that involves the singing and dancing mouse who has his own theme park, ho ho.  I did see ""Surf's Up"" though, see it I did.  Partially because it was an original idea.  Call me crazy, but after getting a third helping of overacting pirates, swinging spiders, and gambling thieves (who have yet to wise up and hire a money manager) going through the motions, I was all ready for something original.  Even if the movie in question was only marginally original.Yet something strange happened during my viewing of ""Surf's Up:"" I found myself smiling a lot.  Why was I smiling?  Here was a true life story about a penguin who wants to move out of the North Pole, away from his fat brother and ignorant mother, leave his fish sorting job behind (a job that seems more useless then the thankless job of making sure jack-in-the-boxes work), and prove himself to be a great surfer.  The penguin who wants to leave is one named Cody Maverick, the small egg of the family.  His brother is the size of Michael Moore, his mother acts like Tea Leoni (though is not voiced by her), and his dad is never seen because he was eaten by a killer shark.  This is all documented by a film crew, who want to capture the life story of a penguin making his aim for the surfing dream.It's kind of like an animated ""Hoop Dreams,"" though two hours appears to be missing from this film.  The documentary crew followed Cody for about three months of his life, capturing all his intimate moments on camera.  Cody brags and boasts about his ambitions to be the number one surfer in the world, yet when he remembers the rough childhood he had, the cameras catch his reaction on camera.  Cody fondly remembers meeting his idol Big Z, who was the surfing champion until an accident happened during a competition, resulting in Z's death.  We get the feeling Cody never really got over the death.  I know how he feels, I never really got over the unexpected death of Gene Siskel.  Anyway, Cody is entering the competition now, with his best friend Chicken Joe, and his new rival Tank.All the while he falls in love with the lovely Lani, who I assume looks a little provocative for a children's movie, but maybe this is where the MPAA's PG rating comes in.  Being a documentary film and all, many of the shots look grainy and there are scratches on the print sometimes.  Documentaries use different cameras with a different brand of film, so it's easy to see why the movie might not look as clear as some of the recent summer blockbusters.  You also get the sense that the camera crew are not as experienced in making movies as most people are.  The camera constantly shakes a bit, sometimes the microphones show up in the shot when the action gets hectic, but otherwise you can feel the film crews enthusiasm to make this movie as good as it could be.Sadly, I heard that the film crew totally forgot to get the use of the animals real voices for use in the movie, and so Hollywood actors such as Shia LaBeouf, Jeff Bridges, Jon Heder, and James Woods were called in to dub over the animals.  Granted, with the exception that the animals sound familiar, the dubbing is perfect, and I doubt many kids will notice anything is off.  I didn't initially know why I enjoyed this movie so much.  Part of me chalked up my enjoyment of the movie coming off a long, rough week.  This could be true, but I think it's more then that.  I bad movie tends to worsen a bad mood for me.  A good movie helps lift me up from it.""Surf's Up"" caught me off guard because it's such a charming film.  I admit it's a bit predictable for a documentary, but it's also more uplifted then ""An Inconvenient Truth"" is.  After the movie was done I snapped my fingers in frustration: I never learned to surf, and I don't have a beach to go to periodically.  Oh well, there's always a trip to New Jersey that can fix that.  At the moment, this is the front runner for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.Rating: **** stars",4,Bringing Fun Back To The Theaters,1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,4330,"['Penguins', 'are', 'just', 'cool', 'are', 'sitting', 'eggs', 'singing', 'dancing', 'case', 'movie', 'surfing', 'rocks', 'waves', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'anything', 'wrong', 'days', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Surf', 'Up', 'idea', 'watching', 'movie', 'surfing', 'penguins', 'seemed', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'entertainment', 'potential', 'idea', 'singing', 'dancing', 'mouse', 'who', 'own', 'theme', 'park', 'ho', 'ho', 'did', 'see', 'Surf', 'Up', 'see', 'did', 'Partially', 'was', 'original', 'idea', 'Call', 'crazy', 'getting', 'third', 'helping', 'overacting', 'pirates', 'swinging', 'spiders', 'gambling', 'thieves', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'wise', 'up', 'hire', 'money', 'manager', 'going', 'motions', 'was', 'ready', 'something', 'original', 'Even', 'movie', 'question', 'was', 'only', 'marginally', 'original.Yet', 'something', 'strange', 'happened', 'viewing', 'Surf', 'Up', 'found', 'smiling', 'lot', 'Why', 'was', 'smiling', 'Here', 'was', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'penguin', 'who', 'move', 'North', 'Pole', 'away', 'fat', 'brother', 'ignorant', 'mother', 'leave', 'fish', 'sorting', 'job', 'job', 'more', 'useless', 'then', 'thankless', 'job', 'making', 'sure', 'jack-in-the-boxes', 'work', 'prove', 'be', 'great', 'surfer', 'penguin', 'who', 'leave', 'one', 'named', 'Cody', 'Maverick', 'small', 'egg', 'family', 'brother', 'size', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'mother', 'acts', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'not', 'voiced', 'dad', 'never', 'seen', 'was', 'eaten', 'killer', 'shark', 'documented', 'film', 'crew', 'who', 'want', 'capture', 'life', 'story', 'penguin', 'making', 'aim', 'surfing', 'dream.It', 'kind', 'animated', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'two', 'hours', 'be', 'missing', 'film', 'documentary', 'crew', 'followed', 'Cody', 'about', 'three', 'months', 'life', 'capturing', 'intimate', 'moments', 'camera', 'Cody', 'brags', 'ambitions', 'be', 'number', 'one', 'surfer', 'world', 'yet', 'when', 'rough', 'childhood', 'had', 'cameras', 'catch', 'reaction', 'camera', 'Cody', 'fondly', 'meeting', 'idol', 'Big', 'Z', 'who', 'was', 'surfing', 'champion', 'accident', 'happened', 'competition', 'resulting', 'Z', 'death', 'get', 'feeling', 'Cody', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'death', 'know', 'how', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'unexpected', 'death', 'Gene', 'Siskel', 'Anyway', 'Cody', 'entering', 'competition', 'now', 'best', 'friend', 'Chicken', 'Joe', 'new', 'rival', 'while', 'love', 'lovely', 'Lani', 'who', 'assume', 'little', 'provocative', 'children', 'movie', 'maybe', 'where', 'MPAA', 'PG', 'rating', 'Being', 'documentary', 'film', 'many', 'shots', 'look', 'grainy', 'are', 'scratches', 'print', 'sometimes', 'Documentaries', 'use', 'different', 'cameras', 'different', 'brand', 'film', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'look', 'as', 'clear', 'recent', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'also', 'get', 'sense', 'camera', 'crew', 'are', 'not', 'experienced', 'making', 'movies', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'camera', 'constantly', 'bit', 'sometimes', 'microphones', 'show', 'up', 'shot', 'when', 'action', 'hectic', 'otherwise', 'can', 'feel', 'film', 'enthusiasm', 'make', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be.Sadly', 'heard', 'film', 'crew', 'totally', 'forgot', 'get', 'use', 'animals', 'real', 'voices', 'use', 'movie', 'so', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'such', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'James', 'Woods', 'were', 'called', 'dub', 'animals', 'Granted', 'exception', 'animals', 'sound', 'familiar', 'dubbing', 'perfect', 'doubt', 'many', 'kids', 'will', 'notice', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'initially', 'know', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'Part', 'chalked', 'up', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'coming', 'off', 'long', 'rough', 'week', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'think', 'more', 'then', 'bad', 'movie', 'worsen', 'bad', 'mood', 'good', 'movie', 'lift', 'up', 'Surf', 'Up', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'such', 'charming', 'film', 'admit', 'bit', 'predictable', 'documentary', 'also', 'more', 'uplifted', 'then', 'Inconvenient', 'Truth', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'snapped', 'fingers', 'frustration', 'never', 'learned', 'surf', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'beach', 'go', 'periodically', 'Oh', 'well', 'always', 'trip', 'New', 'Jersey', 'can', 'fix', 'moment', 'front', 'runner', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature.Rating', '****', 'stars']",N/A

In the last year alone, hes had two of the best films around - `Disturbia' and `Transformers', and I can safely say that the only reason I even went to see this movie on the big screen was because he did the voice for the lead character.What a disaster. Everything that was clich&eacute;d and done-to-death in other movies of the same genre, is rehashed here with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. There has only been one animated movie this year that actually spoke to the heart and was awe-inspiring - that was `Meet the Robinsons'. This film, with all its cuteness and surf board contest plot, didn't have the heart or goofy charm I found in many other movies over the last year (even ""Open Season"") was better than this, honestly.Also, the inclusion of a lot of side characters who are supposed to appeal to you only made the film very, very tired and jaded. I found myself thinking - was this from the early 1990s? It feels like it was made pre-`Toy Story', and not in a good way. My primary problem was the whole cutesy thing they were going for - while proposing lofty ideals such as living your dream, being true to yourself, etc. These principles were done superbly and classily in `Meet the Robinsons'. Here the entire concept was very flat.Don't get me wrong. The animation was first-rate, and Shia's voice-over lends the film all the charm it can possibly muster. However, that's where it all ends. When the end credits rolled as the young penguin and his guru took to the waves, I was left feeling really, really bored and cheated. Of course, every other reviewer would say that `Happy Feet' was a much better penguin movie, and I agree. We really didn't need this film at ALL.If you're looking for a wholesome, really funny and inspiring animated feature this season, go with `Meet the Robinsons'. Both that film and its' soundtrack are awesome.

1094927,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000UFIYOE,Mike Zimmerman,"[0, 0]","Cody Maverick (Shia LaBeouf), an up-and-coming surfer, is about to get his wish as he enters his first pro competition, the Big Z Memorial at Pen Gu Island. Joining him is a documentary team (Ash Brannon, Chris Buck), surfer bum Chicken Joe (Jon Heder), event promoter Reggie Belafonte (James Woods), and talent scout Mikey Abromowitz (Mario Cantone). At the island, he woos penguin lifeguard Lani Aliikai (Zooey Deschanel), butts heads with arrogant competitor Tank Evans aka ""The Shredder (Deidrich Bader), and meets mysterious Geek (Jeff Bridges). Of course, with the latter's help, Cody's hot-shot attitude relinquishes and he could be one of the biggest surfer champions of all time.I'll say this right off the bat, ""Surf's Up"" charmed the heck out of me. It comes from Sony Computer Animation, the same company behind the woefully underrated debut ""Open Season"". Directed by Roger Allers (""The Lion King""), Jill Culton (sotryboard artist for ""Toy Story"", co-writer of ""Monster's Inc""), and Anthony Stacchi (storyboard artist for ""Antz""), this film charmed with a nuanced performance by Martin Lawrence and a great comedic performance from Ashton Kutcher. I guess when competing with a bunch of other animal films that came out, films like this are the odd men out, while overrated films like ""Happy Feet"" take their shine (seriously, that film wasn't that interesting, and adding a reference to global warming is biting off more than you can chew).For ""Surf's Up"", it's another SCA film directed by former Disney vets, this time it's ""Toy Story 2"" co-director Ash Brannon and ""Tarzan"" director Chris Buck (both recieved special thanks for ""Open Season""). Sure, this film has penguins in it, but unlike ""Happy Feet"", it was a refreshingly enjoyable and original film that pretty much every family member will squeal with delight over.Inspired by films from Christopher Guest, ""Surf's Up""'s story is told in mockumentary style, with our directors providing the voices for the camera crew. This, in my opinion, is a breakthrough storytelling device that I would never expect for a film of this genre. Brannon and Buck include shaky cameras, frequent rewinds, zoom-ins and zoom-outs, glitches (scratchy lines across the screen), and whatever. Not since Grindhouse did a movie like this use intentional glitches that would make the experience so engaging.That's nothing, of course, compared to the visuals. ""Open Season"" was more of a silly throwback to vintage cartoon palettes, while Surf's Up has more Pixar-oriented visuals, while still having enough silliness going on to keep the audiences along for the ride. The waves boast excellent detail, the penguin characters have lights reflecting on their coats, the weather looks handled well (especially in the beginning scenes at Anartica), and there's some slow-motion for the surfing scenes. Even the SPEN visuals are impressive.However, ""Surf's Up"" does foul up in certain places. The humor is a little sparse, and like in ""Open Season"", our director friends feel to add some gags involving urination or defecation. Sure, PG means anything goes sometimes, but if you're gonna have gags like this in the film, at the very least back them up with something funny. I'm not too keen on glowworms crapping glowy material, or Geek using pee as an antidote. Thankfully, this crap (tee hee) doesn't get in the way alot, and Brannon and Buck can cut back to the mighty fine ocean visuals or the great acting on display.Speaking of that, the cast here is uniformly awesome, nary a red herring in sight. Shia LaBeouf, playing his character as a Gen-X version of ""Happy Feet""'s Mumble, shimmering with engaging charisma and determination. He is able to be part of a stronger love story, because he's working with Zooey Deschanel, an actress who's lightyears better than ""Disturbia"" love interest Sarah Roemer, and is able to spout some funny lines as well. For Jeff Bridges, this seasoned character actor definitely is having a ball, expressing Tank's obesity, guilt over being shamed after losing a past competition, and mentorness over LaBeouf's character.With a colorful supporting cast of scene stealers like Jon Heder (who's easily making up for his disappointing work in ""Blades of Glory"" with playing a stoner chicken - it has been done before in ""Finding Nemo"", but that's another story), James Woods (putting a spin on his Don King-esque beaver promoter), and Mario Cantone (while not in the film much, Cantone easily walks away with some funny scenes, especially with Woods), it's even better that all actors worked together in one studio rather than apart, allowing them to improv successfully. Oh, and did we mention pro surfers Kelly Slater and Rob Machado make cameos as ""themselves""? And that E! Network reporter Sal Masakela (a former X-Games commentator) does additional voicework, being the second one from that star ****er realm to appear in a hit movie (Ryan Seacrest in ""Knocked Up"")? Their cameos are 100% welcome and further compliment the film's cheeky nature.I also dug the soundtrack. Brannon and Buck throw in some popular tunes, including those from Green Day (""Holiday"", ""Welcome to Paradies""), New Radicals (the sublime '90s smash ""You Get What You Give""), Incubus (""Drive""), Pearl Jam (""Big Wave""), The Romantics (the upbeat classic ""What I Like About You""), and Big Nose (a cover version of ""Wipe Out""). Instead of just making the film think its so hip, it adds energy to a film that's riddled with irrepressible fun. Forget ""Happy Feet"", this is a penguin film that you'll definitely want to sink into.",5,"""I can feel it in my nuggets.""",1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,5579,"['Cody', 'Maverick', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf',

It's very close - and the main difference is that here it's done like there's a documentary crew covering all the action and occasionally adding interviews and ""archival footage"" to provide atmosphere and backdrop for the ongoing story.  Jeff Bridges channels the Dude (you know, the Dude, fromThe Big Lebowski) as ""Big Z,"" the former king of the waves who's thought to be long gone.  Big Z (think the Chief from Cars) becomes the reluctant mentor to Shia LeBeouf's Cody, a cocky young surfer who needs to learn patience, and develops a crush on the Big Z's niece.  There's Chicken Joe (think Mater), and a bunch of other crazy penguins.  The animation looks good and it doesn't feel like your generic animated film.

Not as zany as Happy Feet, but with more depth of story than Madagascar, this is probably the most balanced of all the penguin comedies.  The story is a classic sports story, along the same thread as The Mighty Ducks, The Sandlot, and The Natural.  It has good guys and bad guys.  In this case, the bad guys include an arrogant surfer penguin and his ruthless promoter.  The good guys include a retired surfer penguin who was its greatest showman, and an up-and-coming surfer with too much angst and not enough patience.  And there is of course the girl penguin, mature beyond her age and responsible towards others.The setting is of course crazy; penguins cannot survive in the tropics, but this is Hollywood, so anything goes, including a chicken that survives in the South Pole.  The special effects and animation are good, but not outlandish.  All the animals look real, as does the ocean, but there are few episodes of eye-candy.

If talking animals or insects works for one studio, you can be sure all of the remaining companies will have a version of their own.  This trend can be seen in the area of animated penguins as well though Surf's Up is guilty of borrowing nearly nothing from the competition.Surfs Up literally began on a unique premise: It threads the needle between a typical narrative-driven story, and an action sports documentary.  The hot & cold Shia LaBeouf provides the voice of Cody Maverick quite convincingly. Cody is a young penguin with aspirations of becoming a professional surf champion despite his distant home in the frigid arctic and very little support from his family.His natural talent coupled to his underdog back-story results in the attention of a documentary film crew.  In his documented travels from ice block-riding beginnings to stardom, Cody hooks up with a burnt out surfing chicken (voice by Jon Heder), a beautiful, penguin lifeguard (Zooey Deschanel), an arrogant competitor (Diedrich Bader) and a mentor (Jeff Bridges).The moral of course is that the destination is sometimes less important than the voyage and looking back on the film as a whole, it succeeds fairly convincingly even considering that the latter part of the first decade of the 2000s will surely be remembered for the world's collective and sudden interest in penguins.  For a moment there documentaries like March of the Penguins had the populous' attention and hearts and animated pictures such as Happy Feet, The Penguins of Madagascar, and Surf's up were on the scene to offer a slightly lighter hearted approach to the subject matter.What separates Surf's Up from all of the rest of the flightless bird entries of the era (aside from the surfing slant) is the fact that the entire movie is designed, quite flawlessly I should mention, to resemble a documentary piece.  What's that, you ask, a documentary like National Geographic would put out about the trials and tribulations of ice-dwelling penguins in the arctic?  Absolutely not.  Rather a documentary that would be right at home to real life surfers or skateboarders with the characters continually acknowledging and even interacting with the camera crews following them around.The premise revolves around some very human-like talking animals who eat, sleep and drink the surf culture and is done so with enough poise to surely delight real surfers without boring those viewers who know only that surfing is a sport involving water and a wooden board.Perhaps most impressive however are the visuals themselves.  Sony Imageworks may not yet have the respect or recognition as say Pixar, Blue Sky, or Dreamworks but if the lighting and texturing used in Surf's Up are any indication of what they're capable of, expect that stat to change.  The water effects, weather, and waves are truly breath taking throughout the 85-minutes.  The waves in particular are absolutely amazing to behold.  The character models are solid and appropriately fun and the animation offers up nothing deserving of complaint.The humor is, for the most part, low-key with gags and lines of dialog pretty evenly distributed to appeal to kids and adults alike.  This is one of those rare animated films that will likely appeal even to teens who generally steer clear of the whole genre lest word of their involvement leak and ruin their reputation.In all Surf's Up is a surprisingly under-hyped entry in the ever-increasing pool of computer animated feature films.  With excellent performances by Jeff Bridges and Shia Labeouf, perhaps the biggest surprise comes in the form of Jon Heder's (of Napoleon Dynamite fame) vocal performance as a surfing chicken; a performance that can actually be appreciated more by watching the behind-the-scenes featurettes included on the disc.",4,Originality Elevates Some Spectacular Visuals,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,3864,"['not', 'too', 'hard', 'spot', 'trends', 'computer', 'animated', 'feature', 'films', 'talking', 'animals', 'insects', 'works', 'one', 'studio', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'remaining', 'companies', 'will', 'have', 'version', 'own', 'trend', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'area', 'animated', 'penguins', 'well', 'Surf', 'Up', 'guilty', 'borrowing', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'competition.Surfs', 'Up', 'literally', 'began', 'unique', 'premise', 'needle', 'typical', 'narrative-driven', 'story', 'action', 'sports', 'documentary', 'hot', 'cold', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'voice', 'Cody', 'Maverick', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'Cody', 'young', 'penguin', 'aspirations', 'becoming', 'professional', 'surf', 'champion', 'distant', 'home', 'frigid', 'arctic', 'very', 'little', 'support', 'family.His', 'natural', 'talent', 'coupled', 'underdog', 'back-story', 'results', 'attention', 'documentary', 'film', 'crew', 'documented', 'travels', 'ice', 'block-riding', 'beginnings', 'stardom', 'Cody', 'up', 'burnt', 'out', 'surfing', 'chicken', 'voice', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'beautiful', 'penguin', 'lifeguard', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'arrogant', 'competitor', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'mentor', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'moral', 'course', 'destination', 'sometimes', 'less', 'important', 'voyage', 'looking', 'back', 'film', 'whole', 'fairly', 'convincingly', 'even', 'considering', 'latter', 'part', 'first', 'decade', '2000s', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'remembered', 'world', 'collective', 'sudden', 'interest', 'penguins', 'moment', 'there', 'March', 'Penguins', 'had', 'populous', 'attention', 'hearts', 'animated', 'pictures', 'such', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Penguins', 'Madagascar', 'Surf', 'up', 'were', 'scene', 'offer', 'slightly', 'lighter', 'hearted', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter.What', 'Surf', 'Up', 'rest', 'flightless', 'bird', 'entries', 'era', 'aside', 'surfing', 'slant', 'fact', 'entire', 'movie', 'designed', 'quite', 'flawlessly', 'should', 'mention', 'resemble', 'documentary', 'piece', 'What', 'ask', 'documentary', 'National', 'Geographic', 'would', 'put', 'out', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'ice-dwelling', 'penguins', 'arctic', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'Rather', 'documentary', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'home', 'real', 'life', 'surfers', 'skateboarders', 'characters', 'continually', 'acknowledging', 'even', 'interacting', 'camera', 'crews', 'following', 'around.The', 'premise', 'very', 'human-like', 'talking', 'animals', 'who', 'eat', 'sleep', 'drink', 'surf', 'culture', 'done', 'so', 'enough', 'poise', 'surely', 'delight', 'real', 'surfers', 'boring', 'viewers', 'who', 'know', 'only', 'surfing', 'sport', 'involving', 'water', 'wooden', 'board.Perhaps', 'most', 'impressive', 'however', 'are', 'visuals', 'Sony', 'Imageworks', 'may', 'not', 'yet', 'have', 'respect', 'recognition', 'say', 'Pixar', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'Dreamworks', 'lighting', 'texturing', 'used', 'Surf', 'Up', 'are', 'indication', 'what', ""'re"", 'capable', 'expect', 'stat', 'change', 'water', 'effects', 'weather', 'waves', 'are', 'truly', 'taking', '85-minutes', 'waves', 'particular', 'are', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'behold', 'character', 'models', 'are', 'solid', 'appropriately', 'fun', 'animation', 'up', 'nothing', 'deserving', 'complaint.The', 'humor', 'most', 'part', 'low-key', 'gags', 'lines', 'dialog', 'pretty', 'evenly', 'distributed', 'appeal', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'one', 'rare', 'animated', 'films', 'will', 'likely', 'appeal', 'even', 'teens', 'who', 'generally', 'steer', 'clear', 'whole', 'genre', 'lest', 'word', 'involvement', 'leak', 'ruin', 'reputation.In', 'Surf', 'Up', 'surprisingly', 'under-hyped', 'entry', 'ever-increasing', 'pool', 'computer', 'animated', 'feature', 'films', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Shia', 'Labeouf', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'form', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'fame', 'vocal', 'performance', 'surfing', 'chicken', 'performance', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'appreciated', 'more', 'watching', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'included', 'disc']",N/A

1094938,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000UFIYOE,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 6]","**1/2""Surf's Up"" is the only movie I know of that would feel equally at home on ESPN, Animal Planet and the Cartoon Network.  A cross between ""Endless Summer"" and ""March of the Penguins,"" ""Surf's Up"" has been designed as an animated mockumentary, replete with on-the-spot interviews and grainy newsreel footage from the ""glory days"" of penguin surfing.The star of the movie-within-a-movie is Cody Maverick, a pint-sized penguin with a king-sized dream of becoming an international surfing champion.  To that end, he leaves his home in Antarctica and ventures to Hawaii to take part in the Big Z Memorial Surf-off, a competition held in honor of the surfing legend who was washed away by a giant wave during a previous contest, never to be heard from again.""Surf's Up"" certainly earns points for creativity and originality, as well as for its stunning animation which comes about as close to approximating real life as any movie featuring a bevy of wisecracking penguins is ever likely to get.  But, for all its virtues, I can't help wondering who the target audience for this film actually is.  The movie seems too esoteric in its references and too lacking in forward momentum to appeal much to the younger set, and it's too obvious and pedestrian in its humor and message to be of much interest to adults.  Indeed, as I was watching it, I felt, sadly, that an awful lot of talent and work had gone into the production, but that the movie itself never really finds a way to draw the audience into its story.  Perhaps the pseudo-documentary conceit, clever and imaginative as it is, ultimately ends up acting as a distancing device between audience and subject.  Or, perhaps, it's simply that the script itself, when you get right down to it,  isn't really all that funny.I don't mean to diminish the truly exceptional work done here by the animators.  There's an almost surreal beauty to many of the scenes (particularly the darkly lit ones), and the facial expressions on the penguins are remarkably lifelike and fluid.  The vocal talents of Shia LaBeouf (""Disturbia""), Jeff Bridges, Jon Heder (""Napoleon Dynamite"") and James Woods are also put to good use in service of the material.All the elements would seem to be in place for ""Surf`s Up"" to score as a first class animated treat.  Instead, the movie falls victim to an unimpressive screenplay as well as an unavoidable sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu caused by its coming so soon on the heels of 2005`s ""March of the Penguins"" and last year`s ""Happy Feet.""  Perhaps we've all just had our fill of adorable penguin movies for the time being.

The story just meanders along at times, much like Big Z has done when he bailed out on all that society stuff (a hollow, tiresome theme explored far too often in both adult and children's films).Overall, I did enjoy the film with my kids and even laughed out loud a number of times, but in the end it all felt too familar and predictable even with the new approach used in the film.",3,"Family fun that's a bit different, but something is definitely missing here.",1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,1363,"['wish', 'could', 'put', 'finger', 'just', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'fun', 'family', 'film', 'escape', 'me.The', 'strengths', 'film', 'are', 'humor', 'overall', 'mocumentary', 'style', 'not', 'typo', ']', 'was', 'different', 'engaging', 'voices', 'were', 'solid', 'especially', 'main', 'cast', 'ever', 'reliable', 'James', 'Woods', 'TV', 'Shark', 'Hades', ""Disney'sHercules"", 'perfect', 'fast-talking', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'delivery', 'well', 'role', 'cartoonland', 'general', 'CGI', 'stuff', 'was', 'good', 'worked', 'well', 'approach', 'film', 'fun', 'documentaries', 'hence', 'mock-umentary', 'comment', 'earlier.The', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'are', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'why', 'mocumentary', 'approach', 'was', 'helpful', 'making', 'feel', 'different', 'when', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'original', 'somewhat', 'soul-less', 'feel', 'film', 'film', 'just', 'lack', 'heart', 'something', 'more', 'honestly', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'words', 'story', 'just', 'meanders', 'along', 'times', 'much', 'Big', 'Z', 'done', 'when', 'bailed', 'out', 'society', 'stuff', 'hollow', 'tiresome', 'theme', 'explored', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'adult', 'children', 'films', '.Overall', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'kids', 'even', 'laughed', 'out', 'number', 'times', 'end', 'felt', 'too', 'familar', 'predictable', 'even', 'new', 'approach', 'used', 'film']",N/A

First time directors Brannon and Buck take Christopher Guest's ad-lib mockumentary approach to this, the Spinal Tap of the animated docu-spoof penguin surfing genre (niche enough for ya?). The story follows Cody Maverick (LaBeouf) who, after a chance meeting with legendary surfer Big Z, dedicates his life to the sport. Unfortunately Big Z died while hanging ten and Cody dreams of eclipsing his hero by winning the annual Big Z Memorial Surf Off run by crass promoter Reggie Belafonte (Woods). With ESPN's coverage of the championship, Cody gets his chance to strut his stuff in front of the cameras but pride soon turns to embarrassment when he's wiped out by boorish current champ Tank Evans (Dietrich Bader) before the competition even begins. Nursed back to health by Geek (Bridges), Cody learns that winning isn't everything - but is Geek really Big Z in hiding? Sony have surpassed last year's Happy Feet, which really raised the bar in terms of animation, with this absolute gem of a movie. Although it riffs on surfing greats like Big Wednesday, Endless Summer, Riding Giants and Into The Liquid, you don't need to have seen those movies to appreciate the jokes - and there are plenty of them in the improvised dialogue between LaBeouf, Heder and Bridges, who brings his Dudeness (or 'Duder' or 'El Duderino' if you're not into the whole brevity thing) to Big Z. Surf's Up doesn't waste a lot of time messing around with a love story, nor are there dance numbers and the characters don't sing along to classic songs - it's all story and laughs. The only disappointment is that they sometimes veer off from the mockumentary angle, and calling the movie Surf's Up without using The Beach Boys or Jim Steinman on the soundtrack.

1094951,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000UFIYOE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","I have a lifelong love of good animation. This is why I consistently go to films like ""Open Season"", ""Meet The Robinsons"" and ""Cars"", always searching for that next great piece of animation. You know, the type that can rival ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast:"" or ""The Incredibles"" and remain a classic for future generations.Because of this, I frequently read interviews and books on and about animation. In a recent biography of Walt Disney, he is quoted as being dissatisfied with his animator's ability to create water for his shorts and features. I have read on more than one occasion that other animators have felt the same way. Apparently, that problem no longer exists. In ""Surf's Up"", the newest offering from Sony Pictures Animation, the people who brought us the above average ""Open Season"", nails the animation of water, water of all kinds, waves, placid pools, half pipes, rain and more. This one aspect of the film is simply stunning to watch. It actually looks like the filmmakers photographed water and added the cute little penguins later. In fact, a lot of the animation looks so real that it might have been photographed.Will ""Surf's Up"" join the pantheon of classics? I don't think so, but it is a very entertaining film. It just lacks a little more sly humor, a little more zing to bring it to this level.But as it is, ""Surf's"" is the best non-Pixar/ non-Disney film I have seen in some time.The film is designed to resemble a documentary; the type that might be seen on ESPN. The filmmaker's interview Cody (Shia LaBeouf) at his home in Antarctica. Big Z, a surfing icon, went on a press tour after winning his ninth surfing championship. The tour included a stop in Antarctica, allowing a young Cody to meet his idol. His mother and brother have come to accept Cody's love for surfing, but the rest of their community can't understand why he won't help with their collective daily chores. And Cody doesn't understand what point there is to sorting fish, so there you have it. Then one day, Reggie Belafonte (James Woods), a sea otter with a Don King do, decides to send out a scouting expedition; he needs to find the best competition for his upcoming Surf Championship. His current champion, Tank (Diedrich Bader), the surfer who originally beat Big Z, is too good and the publicity level is down. So he sends Mikey (Mario Cantone), his assistant, a bird, out on the whale and they scour the penguin communities around the globe. When they arrive in Antarctica, Cody jumps at the chance and won't take no. Finally, Big Mike relents and they make their way back to Pengu Island for the big meet. Chicken Joe (Jon Heder) is also ready to compete. On the island, they meet Lani (Zooey Deschanel), a lifeguard. As soon as Tank meets Cody, their rivalry builds and they enter a surf-off. Cody is hit by a big wave and Lani takes him to meet the Geek (Jeff Bridges), a penguin who is living off the grid and doesn't like the intrusion. But Geek helps Cody and they soon challenge Tank during the big surf-off.""Surf's Up"" is more than your average animated film for the simple reason the filmmakers are telling the story in a pseudo-documentary style. It is almost like we are watching a ""Behind The Scenes"" type of special made to coincide with the big championship. Because this style of filmmaking is established early on, it allows the filmmakers to move through the story quickly, interject some quick jokes, getting things moving fast. They are able to jump around without having to pay enormous attention to the conventions of narrative.We also learn about Cody very quickly. Through some brief interviews with his brother and mother, we learn about Cody's father and how the young penguin was deeply affected by the appearance of Big Z. This leads to a lifelong obsession with surfing, an activity many in his community don't understand. But the important thing is it makes him happy. And he simply can't understand the importance of the community's main activity, fish sorting.When Mike arrives, Cody doesn't make a good impression, but he won't take no and Mike realizes this. So Cody earns a spot.Shia LaBeouf, the new `It"" Kid in Hollywood (he's the star of the recent ""Disturbia"", he headlines the soon-to-be released ""Transformers"" and has been signed to play Indiana Jones' son in ""Indiana Jones 4"") does a good job with the voice of Cody. As a young man, he is able to give Cody that sort of unsure tremor in the voice of most teenagers. I'm not sure if this is acting, exactly, he seems to have the same timbre in his voice in most of his roles. But it works for this character.At times, Cody is suitably non-interested, excited, put off, you know, just about everything a typical teenager exhibits.Zooey Deschanel is much the same. She simply seems to be voicing her role in her normal voice. It is good work, but not outstanding. As Lina, she becomes the love interest of Cody. A lifeguard, she shows a lot of compassion and empathy towards everyone, even Tank. Naturally, when she meets Cody, she is drawn to his natural likeability and tries to help him out, when he needs it.The real voice talent lies in the rest of the cast. James Woods is very cute as Reggie Belafonte, the sea otter who is also the surf promoter. Fast-talking, with spiky hair, he will do anything to promote the Surf Championship's that he is in charge of. In his book, there is no such thing as bad publicity. He grandstands, pretends to care when necessary, runs around, becomes the doting parent, all on the turn of a dime.Jeff Bridges plays the Geek, a large penguin who is a beach-bum sort who lives off the grid in the middle of Pengu Island. He is very amusing, a sort of variation on `The Dude' from ""The Big Lebowski"", Bridges makes this character amusing and charming. Clearly trying to just relax his way through life, he doesn't want to get involved with Cody and his quest to win the surf championship. After Cody gets injured, Lina brings him to her friend, for the Geek to look after him, take care of him. As they get to know each other, they realize they have something in common and the Geek tries to help Cody realize his dream, to become the next great surfer, just like his idol, Big Z.Mario Cantone dials it down considerably for his role as Mike, the little bird who is Reggie's talent scout. Fussy and overworked, he flits about and tries to keep things moving. It is a funny role and more memorable because Cantone doesn't play it as broad as he could. If he played the role in his normal persona, the character would be unbearable.Diedrich Bader (TV's ""The Drew Carey Show"", ""The Beverly Hillbillies"") voices Tank, the large penguin who took the championship from Big Z nine years ago. Now, going for his tenth championship, he is full of his own stardom, surrounded by young admirers and cuts a wide swath wherever he walks, or surfs, and doesn't care who gets in his way. He is an egotistic jerk but still has his fans.Jon Heder plays Chicken Joe, a chicken who enters the surf contest and before he knows it, he is one of the top three contenders. Heder does a great job and I didn't even realize it was him until I checked the credits. Throughout, Chicken Joe is just out to have good time. And this helps him get through all of the problems everyone else has to deal with. His love for life seems to lead him blissfully through the maze. This state of Zen adds a lot of laughs to the story.""Surf's Up"" is funny, and well worth some of your summer movie dollars, but there are a couple of instances when the humor is directed squarely at children. There are a couple of little penguins designed to amp up the cuteness factor. This is fine, and inevitable, but they only elicit laughter during one of these appearances; the rest of the time, they are clearly pandering to the children in the audience and serve as groan worthy moments for the adults. Also, given the fact ""Surf's"" is rated `PG', these moments are aimed at kids smaller than the audience who will likely be sitting in the theater. If the filmmakers had concentrated on creating humor appropriate for the audience.That overlookable fault aside, ""Surf's Up"" is one of the better-animated efforts to arrive in the last few years.",4,"Cool, dude",1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,8242,"['have', 'lifelong', 'love', 'good', 'animation', 'why', 'consistently', 'go', 'films', 'Open', 'Season', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'Cars',

So it's with sadness and disappointment that I insert one criticism for the benefit of parents, hopefully a movie producer or two, and those whose sensitivities may be similar to my own: and that is, I wish there was a movie maker possessed of the courage to break that unwritten law which dictates, All Movies Must Contain SOMETHING Foul.This film treats our visual and audio senses to a delightful, even exhilarating experience, then abruptly insults our finer sensibilities with several instances of bathroom humor. It's out of sync with the spectacular visual beauty, the marvelous characters, humor, and compelling plot. My feeling is the same as if a vandal smeared feces on a Michelangelo painting: Why would anyone do that to something so beautiful?It's the only reason I didn't give the film five stars.",4,One Caviat Regarding an Otherwise Spectacular Movie,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,947,"['Many', 'praises', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'lauding', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'funny', 'original', 'charming', 'movie', 'heartily', 'support', 'sadness', 'disappointment', 'insert', 'one', 'criticism', 'benefit', 'parents', 'hopefully', 'movie', 'producer', 'two', 'sensitivities', 'may', 'be', 'similar', 'own', 'wish', 'was', 'movie', 'maker', 'possessed', 'courage', 'break', 'unwritten', 'law', 'Movies', 'Must', 'Contain', 'SOMETHING', 'Foul.This', 'film', 'treats', 'visual', 'audio', 'senses', 'delightful', 'even', 'exhilarating', 'experience', 'then', 'abruptly', 'insults', 'finer', 'sensibilities', 'several', 'instances', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'sync', 'spectacular', 'visual', 'beauty', 'marvelous', 'characters', 'humor', 'compelling', 'plot', 'feeling', 'same', 'vandal', 'smeared', 'feces', 'Michelangelo', 'painting', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'beautiful', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

Griffith ""EveStev""","[0, 0]","This movie was my 12-year old son's pick, and I plopped it into the DVD player for him expecting to walk away and go do something else, but from the start, this movie drew me in, and I ended up watching the entire movie --  my wife and older son overheard us laughing, and they joined in for the entire movie also.  This movie was funny, it was satirical, and the humor was at times irreverently funny; the animation was also outstanding.  I also enjoyed the reality based format that this movie used -- somewhat similar to ""The Office"" sitcom. The last animation that surprised me like this one did, was ""Over the Hedge"" -- if you liked that, then you'll enjoy this, and vice-versa.",5,This movie surprised me,1305417600,"05 15, 2011",2011,683,"['movie', 'was', '12-year', 'old', 'son', 'pick', 'plopped', 'DVD', 'player', 'expecting', 'walk', 'away', 'go', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'start', 'movie', 'drew', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'entire', 'movie', 'wife', 'older', 'son', 'laughing', 'joined', 'entire', 'movie', 'also', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'satirical', 'humor', 'was', 'times', 'irreverently', 'funny', 'animation', 'was', 'also', 'outstanding', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'reality', 'based', 'format', 'movie', 'used', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'Office', 'sitcom', 'last', 'animation', 'surprised', 'one', 'did', 'was', 'Hedge', 'liked', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'vice-versa']",N/A
