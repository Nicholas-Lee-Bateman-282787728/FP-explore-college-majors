830923,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B0002CX224,Erica Anderson,"[18, 20]","Of the few crime dramas I watch (""Cold Case"", the original ""CSI"", ""Without a Trace"", and ""Law & Order: SVU""), ""Law & Order:SVU"" is by far my personal favorite show. I watch this show religiously on both NBC and USA network. Out of the five seasons, I strongly believe that season five is the strongest season in the series because the storywriting has been so compelling. That is just my personal opinion. I was originally unhappy when Stephanie March left the series after the first 3 or 4 episodes in season five and was wary of Diane Neal as the new assistant D.A. Thank heavens I was proven wrong. Diane Neal has proved to be a worthy assistant D.A to me. Casey Novak is just as defiant and strong-willed as Alexandra Cabot was, especially when she butt heads with Detectives Stabler and Benson like in her first episode ""Serendipity"". Kinda funny how Diane made her first appearance on the show a couple of seasons back as a co-defendant, and now she is back as the new A.D.A. Sure the plot twists can be confusing but that makes watching this show so enjoyable to be. A lot of my favorite episodes comes from season five. One of my personal favorite episodes is ""Ritual"" where a young African boy is found murdered. His death appeared to be a ritual death but appearances can be deceiving. Ice-T really shines in this particular episode as 'Fin'. His involvement in the case really shines through and is definitely one of Ice-T's best performances. I really think Ice-T compliments Richard Belzer's snarky, conspiracy loving character. The dynamics between the detectives are certainly worth writing home about. Another really strong episode was the last episode with Stephanie March as Alexandra Cabot in ""Loss"" which involves a murdered undercover agent. I was moved by the ending and how Stephanie left the show. Although I predicted how her character would be written off, I still thought it was well written. I especially like the partnership of Detectives Stabler and Benson. Although I wonder why seasons 2, 3, and 4 weren't released prior to season 5, I still think that releasing season 5 was a great idea. It is my personal favorite season of the show, can't wait for season 4 now (which comes in second behind season 5).",5,My favorite show,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,2237,"['few', 'crime', 'dramas', 'watch', 'Cold', 'Case', 'original', 'CSI', 'Trace', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'far', 'personal', 'favorite', 'show', 'watch', 'show', 'religiously', 'NBC', 'USA', 'network', 'five', 'seasons', 'strongly', 'believe', 'season', 'five', 'strongest', 'season', 'series', 'storywriting', 'been', 'so', 'compelling', 'just', 'personal', 'opinion', 'was', 'originally', 'unhappy', 'when', 'Stephanie', 'March', 'left', 'series', 'first', '3', '4', 'episodes', 'season', 'five', 'was', 'wary', 'Diane', 'Neal', 'new', 'assistant', 'D.A', 'Thank', 'heavens', 'was', 'proven', 'wrong', 'Diane', 'Neal', 'proved', 'be', 'worthy', 'assistant', 'D.A', 'Casey', 'Novak', 'just', 'defiant', 'strong-willed', 'Alexandra', 'Cabot', 'was', 'especially', 'when', 'butt', 'heads', 'Detectives', 'Stabler', 'Benson', 'first', 'episode', 'Serendipity', 'Kinda', 'funny', 'how', 'Diane', 'made', 'first', 'appearance', 'show', 'couple', 'seasons', 'back', 'co-defendant', 'now', 'back', 'new', 'A.D.A', 'Sure', 'plot', 'twists', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'watching', 'show', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'be', 'lot', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'five', 'One', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Ritual', 'where', 'young', 'African', 'boy', 'found', 'murdered', 'death', 'appeared', 'be', 'ritual', 'death', 'appearances', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'Ice-T', 'really', 'particular', 'episode', ""'Fin"", 'involvement', 'case', 'really', 'definitely', 'one', 'Ice-T', 'best', 'performances', 'really', 'think', 'Ice-T', 'compliments', 'Richard', 'Belzer', 'snarky', 'conspiracy', 'loving', 'character', 'dynamics', 'detectives', 'are', 'certainly', 'worth', 'writing', 'home', 'really', 'strong', 'episode', 'was', 'last', 'episode', 'Stephanie', 'March', 'Alexandra', 'Cabot', 'Loss', 'murdered', 'undercover', 'agent', 'was', 'moved', 'ending', 'how', 'Stephanie', 'left', 'show', 'predicted', 'how', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'still', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'especially', 'partnership', 'Detectives', 'Stabler', 'Benson', 'wonder', 'why', 'seasons', '2', '3', '4', 'were', ""n't"", 'released', 'prior', 'season', '5', 'still', 'think', 'releasing', 'season', '5', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'personal', 'favorite', 'season', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '4', 'now', 'second', 'season', '5']",Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Fifth Year

I hadn't gotten into SVU or CI for a while, but then I started watching them instead of repeats of the original series, and now I'm totally hooked on SVU.  It's surpassed the original series, in my opinion, and every episode has me in a trance.  This is easily one of the best series on TV, and season 5, like the rest, is spectacular.Christopher Meloni (Det. Stabler) gives nothing but brilliant performances in every episode.  Though I'm not as big a fan of Mariska Hargitay (Det. Benson), she is a fabulous actor and a great asset to the series.  Comedian Richard Belzer and rapper Ice-T also add something special to this awesome show.  Watching them all work together is a beautiful thing, and once you start, it's hard to stop.  Dick Wolf continues to deliver some of the best drama on TV today.This is a great set to pick up.  I promise that once you start watching, you'll be hooked.

Some of the best episodes are Mean, Slaves, Mother, Loss, Serendipity, Choice, and Careless.As far as the DVDs themselves, I was a little disappointed that they went the cheaper route and used 2 sided DVDs. In my experience, these get messed up a little easier due to the fact that there isn't a side that can take a little injury, and no matter how careful you are with your DVDs, you are going to encounter fingerprints and/or scratches.There weren't many extras but I rarely watch those anyway.

I was disappointed in the SVU alumni montage because I think it missed some good stars that have appeared.All in all this DVD set is great.",5,Great Season,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,853,"['season', 'SVU', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'intense', 'introduction', 'new', 'ADA', 'season', '5', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'episodes', 'are', 'Mean', 'Slaves', 'Mother', 'Loss', 'Serendipity', 'Choice', 'Careless.As', 'far', 'DVDs', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'went', 'cheaper', 'route', 'used', '2', 'sided', 'DVDs', 'experience', 'get', 'messed', 'up', 'little', 'easier', 'due', 'fact', ""n't"", 'side', 'can', 'take', 'little', 'injury', 'matter', 'how', 'careful', 'are', 'DVDs', 'are', 'going', 'encounter', 'fingerprints', 'and/or', 'scratches.There', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'extras', 'rarely', 'watch', 'anyway', 'police', 'sketches', 'Ice-T', 'BD', 'Wong', 'Dann', 'Florek', 'were', 'interesting', 'was', 'disappointed', 'SVU', 'alumni', 'montage', 'think', 'missed', 'good', 'stars', 'have', 'appeared.All', 'DVD', 'set', 'great']",Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Fifth Year

830938,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B0002CX224,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","And so we find ourselves at the fifth season of Law and Order Special Victims Unit.  And its a pretty good season, better than the past two and ranking up there near the top.  And if you're reading this review without having seen the first season, stop and go start at the beginning.  I don't care if you can watch these out of order, it's always good to watch things in order.Law and Order: Special Victims Unit deals with the tough crimes.  Rape, child molestation, elder abuse, etc.  It's not for the light hearted.  But the detectives that investigate these crimes balance it out with compassion and a thirst for justice.  They want to put the bad guys away, and that's what makes this show worth watching.  If it wasn't for the talented actors, this would just be gratuitous violence, but the way they do it ensures that there is a story and lesson within the series.There are twenty five episodes in this season.  And they are all actually quite good.  Not the kind you get up and walk away from anyway, as they keep your attention.  We're still not back to having the detectives home lives carry over episode to episode, so again, this season is pretty much a series of stand-alone episodes.  And that's ok, because they have enough of a plot in each episode that they don't feel unfinished.  There were a lot of thought provoking episodes in this season as well.  Episode four, ""Loss"" deals mainly with ADA Cabot getting herself into quite a mess with a dangerous perpetrator and it keeps you at the end of your seat wondering what's going to happen.  ""Choice"" asks the important question of what rights a mother has over her body when she is pregnant.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.  There are cases involving hate crimes, bullies, teacher student involvement and a whole lot of other hot topics.  But they are managed to be put in a fresh perspective rather than copied identically from the newspaper stories they are inspired from.Characters:Christopher Meloni: Elliot StablerMariska Hargitay: Olivia BensonRichard Belzer: John MunchStephanie March, Alexandra CabotDiane Neal: Casey NovakIce-T: Fin TutuolaB.D. Wong: George HuangDann Florek: Don CragenOnce again I can find no complaint with Meloni or Hargitay's acting.  They always do a great job acting as a team and really seem like real life police detective partners.  They just have that kind of chemistry on the set.  Belzer and Ice-T again weren't in many of the episodes, but at least they were in more than they have been in the last few seasons.  I like the element they add and it shows that there's more than two people in the squad working on cases.  Neal as the new ADA I always take a long time to warm up to when I start re-watching the series.  Since she played a role as a female rapist in one of the previous seasons, it throws me when she comes back as a completely different character.  But eventually I get used to it and am able to appreciate the approach she uses to present the cases.  Although March will always be my favorite ADA.  I think that they did a great job casting the ""bad guys"" in this season two.  They all played parts that I wanted to see the people put away for good and the ones that had the mental problems or other issues were convincing.This really isn't a child suitable show in the end though because of its subject matter.  It may not even be that adult friendly for those who don't like these harsh topics.  And that's perfectly fine.  I frequently question myself on why I like this show so much when it deals with perversion and aside from the train wreck argument, I really do have to say that I like watching the cast and the excellent job they do of portraying police detectives.  They inspire a want of justice and that can only be beneficial.  And then there's always the fact that different causes are brought to light by showing these types of cases on tv.  In all, its just a thought provoking series.Review by M.
