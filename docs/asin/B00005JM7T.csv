with his books.however,i loved it all the same.the cat is a bit much,the mom is a horrible parent like the rugrat parents.her man is a real %#21!@#$%%^&**(head too.2 very small kids are left alone in the house.this crazy 6 ft tall talking cat[mike myers] comes out of a alternate world to have loads of fun with the kids.the entire house is ruined,actualy destroyed.mike meyers is the cat.they go to town at one point too.the cat says something i liked while in the car.the boy,conrad whose 12 is asked by the cat to drive his car.conrad replies""do you think that me driving is really such a good idea?""the cat says,""i dont know.theres this little voice inside me that says no dont let him drive its a bad idea.but i cant hear that little voice because a much louder voice is screaming LET THE 12 YEAR OLD DRIVE"".thats classic mental problem stuff there.its not as good as the grinch movie.but they are both quite good.its far better than the original dr suess version.its pretty much fun for the whole family.there are however a few spots the parents might get offended by.there are a number of sexual remarks made by the cat.they are done in such a way,though that the kids wont realize its bad.ie:during one part the cat steps on a hoe and it springs up and smacks him in the head.he says ""dirty hoe"".this in itself isnt so bad.then he says ""aw baby im sorry .i love you."".he gives it a kiss as if its a girl.i dont think kids can realy add all that up,but you still dont want them calling chicks hos,right?the kids mom is sexy but a mean old !!@#$%^.her man gets the obnoxious character award.he is so hell bent on taking over her life,it takes a high speed chase,a very big scare,and falling into a alternate dimension that tears through the fabrics of reality to get rid of him.it is actualy pretty consistent with the book unlike the grinch.i think mike myers did his best work ever here.but i mean with only that pathetic snl,waynes world and austin powers ,thats pretty much a given.only austin powers,the 1st one was any good out of them.even the special effects are really cool.DONT BE FOOLED!!!!!!!!!!!1THERE ARE A CRAPLOAD OF CAT IN THE HAT BOOKS BY DR SUESS.THEY COULD PUT OUT 15 MOVIES IF THEY WANTED.so heads up,guys.this is a fan calling out a movie set about the cat in the hat.",5,this is what taking psycadelics does to movie making.,1094774400,"09 10,

Note the sarcasm.Watched Cat In The Hat this afternoon and it was just awful. Cliched in every single way, not the least bit amusing, tries to be moral but just comes across as pathetic. The Things are freaky and frightening; the kids.. ehh.. they just play your average kids, nothing stands out, they aren't bad actors by no means but there is no flavour to their performance.Young children around the age of four or five up will more than likely love this, however. Though it's not appropriate to have swearing for a kid's movie, maybe the producers should have thought about that a lot more.The BEST thing about this movie was probably the Universal part with The Cat In The Hat fishing from the moon or whatever; I found that to be quite creative.

614660,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00005JM7T,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[4, 6]","Here I am again, trying to explain why I rented a movie made from a book.  Against my better judgement I have seen three such films this year and every time I have been disappointed.  You'd think I would have learned something by now, but hope does spring eternal.  On the other hand, you'd think that Hollywood would have learned that just because you *can* make a movie, doesn't mean that you should.The book Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss is a true children's classic about a brother and sister who start one rainy day alone and bored, only to find an unexpected adventure with a tall cat who comes knocking at their door.  This cat is full of magical tricks and surprises, but the children soon learn that there is a price to be paid for all the fun; the house is a wreck and mom is coming home soon.  How can they fix everything in time?The movie Cat in the Hat takes a very liberal interpretation of the delightful children's book.  As a matter of fact, it hardly resembles the book at all.  In order to stretch a small rhyming picture book into an hour and a half movie, the screenwriters had to distort the original story, add several characters and subplotlines and entierely do away with anything that resembled the original.  The preview clips that advertised TCITH in theaters made it seem as if the movie kept true to Dr. Seuss' book, but that's just not true.  Even the rhyming verse is edited and stretched out to fit.  You can't improve upon perfection, only ruin it.  Couldn't they have left that alone, at least?I do have some good things to say about the actors involved.  Mike Myers, who plays the Cat, did the best possible job that could have been done with the role he had to work with here.  I have always admired his comedy and he does have some good moments as the Cat.  The little girl who plays Sally is absolutely precious; both kids are good actors, in my opinion.  There's a lot to be said for the valiant attempts at set design and art direction in this film as well.  It can't be easy to translate Seuss's weird, wild style into a three dimensional world for film, but the result kept the feeling of the book's artwork reasonably well despite that challenge.If you have kids that are just dying to see this movie because they love the book and can't imagine that it would disappoint them, this could be a good object lesson for them.

You've got great source material (which is admittedly tough to stretch to an hour and a half), two up-and-coming young actors in Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin, and of course, the very, very funny Mike Myers (sporting a great makeup job) as the mischievous Cat. Seemed like it couldn't fail, right? Well...What a dreadful disappointment. Myers tries hard, and the kids are fun, but this film is just one tired cliche after another. It's silly and inane and insulting rather than funny. With very little to work with (the book was what? 2 dozen pages or so?) Myers has to improvise a great deal to fill in the gaps between set pieces. Sometimes he's funny, especially when he's referencing some of his prior work (Dr. Evil, Wayne's World) and parodying pop-culture figures. Problem is, some kids--even pop-culture savvy ones--may not catch some of his broad cultural references (though adults will) and that may leave them a little bored or restless. It's obvious when the material begins to run thin, because we are suddenly treated to potty humor and mild innuendo (nothing really bad, but is it really necessary?) and bombastic physical comedy--though the &quot;rocket car&quot; scenes were funny in an out-of-control, Roadrunner/Coyote kind of way. But far too many of the gags misfire, and the film seems to assume once too often that &quot;manic and frenzied&quot; equals &quot;funny.&quot; Nope.

Sure there was some potty humor/jokes and stuff like that, which did overflow my boat. So let me say it like this:The setting was wonderful. From the curvy trees, to Sally and Conrad's pretty-and-perfect mother, everything makes you feel like you've really landed in one of Dr. Seuss' books.The story almost follows the book, with a few twists and turns placed inside. Mom goes out, cat comes in and recks the house. He takes out thing 1 and 2 to make matters worse. After all that he leaves the house a total wreck, with mom on the way back home. Just before she enters the house, the cat comes back and cleans up his mess.The acting was so-so. I waited a long time for the cat to actually do something funny; and when he did it raised my laugh-meter up to 4% out of 10%. Dakota Fanning did a wonderful Sally, and so did ""Conrad"". Kelly didn't do to bad either, and Mr. Sean made a few funnny preformances (although his character reminds me alot of somebody in Finding Nemo...).Overall, it's an O.K. movie. I would have given it 2 stars, but the imaginative and whimsicall setting raised that to a total of 3 stars. The only reason I like this movie is because of the fish. He was a rather charming--but over-reactive--little fellow for a picture such as this.

After all it's a classic Dr. Suess story, brought to larger-than-life by Mike Myers, what's not to like?  Well, here's a partial list.Our first introduction to the children the cat entertains involves watching the boy sled down the stairs of his home on a cookie sheet, doing no serious damage to the house or himself.  Remember, this isn't a cartoon kid doing it, but a real, live one.  Do you want your children to try sledding down stairs on a cookie sheet?When the cat shows up he makes two neutering jokes in less than twenty minutes.  Your kids are bound to catch one of them.  Do you want to explain to your children what neutering is?At one point, the cat and the kids are jumping on a couch.  The little girl says its like a circus, to which the cat replies, ""Without the drunken clowns with hepatitis.""  Do you want to explain to your children what hepatitis is?Later, the cat is doing a parody of a cooking show and cuts the end off his tail.  He screams, ""Son of a *****.""  The explicative is beeped out, but he is clearly saying something that begins with a ""B.""  Do you want to explain to your children what he is saying?Interspersed in the cat's routines are snatches of effeminate gay-man stereotypes.  Do stereotypes of any sort have a place in modern children's movies?  Do you want your children imitating gay-man stereotypes?If you've read these quetions I've listed and thought, ""That's no big deal.""  By all means, go rent ""Cat in the Hat"" and heaven help you.  Otherwise, forget this travesty and get the original 1971 cartoon with Alan Sherman, a true children's classic with no neutering jokes, deleted explicatives or hurtful stereotypes.",1,Is this movie right for your kids?,1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,1836,"['many', 'people', 'heard', 'lot', 'negative', 'things', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'so', 'many', 'fact', 'felt', 'had', 'see', 'find', 'out', 'negative', 'reviews', 'were', 'warranted', 'classic', 'Dr.', 'Suess', 'story', 'brought', 'larger-than-life', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'Well', 'here', 'partial', 'list.Our', 'first', 'introduction', 'children', 'cat', 'watching', 'boy', 'sled', 'down', 'stairs', 'home', 'cookie', 'sheet', 'doing', 'serious', 'damage', 'house', 'Remember', ""n't"", 'cartoon', 'kid', 'doing', 'real', 'live', 'one', 'Do', 'want', 'children', 'try', 'sledding', 'down', 'stairs', 'cookie', 'sheet', 'When', 'cat', 'up', 'two', 'neutering', 'jokes', 'less', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'kids', 'are', 'bound', 'catch', 'one', 'Do', 'want', 'explain', 'children', 'what', 'neutering', 'one', 'point', 'cat', 'kids', 'are', 'jumping', 'couch', 'little', 'girl', 'circus', 'cat', 'replies', 'drunken', 'clowns', 'hepatitis', 'Do', 'want', 'explain', 'children', 'what', 'hepatitis', 'Later', 'cat', 'doing', 'parody', 'cooking', 'show', 'end', 'tail', 'Son', '*****', 'explicative', 'beeped', 'out', 'clearly', 'saying', 'something', 'B', 'Do', 'want', 'explain', 'children', 'what', 'saying', 'Interspersed', 'cat', 'routines', 'are', 'snatches', 'effeminate', 'gay-man', 'stereotypes', 'Do', 'stereotypes', 'sort', 'have', 'place', 'modern', 'children', 'movies', 'Do', 'want', 'children', 'imitating', 'gay-man', 'stereotypes', ""'ve"", 'read', 'quetions', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'thought', 'big', 'deal', 'means', 'go', 'rent', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'heaven', 'help', 'Otherwise', 'forget', 'travesty', 'get', 'original', '1971', 'cartoon', 'Alan', 'Sherman', 'true', 'children', 'classic', 'neutering', 'jokes', 'deleted', 'explicatives', 'hurtful', 'stereotypes']",Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat

Bad parts in this are like when the cat step on a garden ho and it wacks him in the face and he says &quot;Dirty ho.&quot;  Also when he pretends to be the pinyada and he gets wacked in the balls and then it shows a girl cat swinging on a swing and another part is when he's going a cooking show and the cat cuts of his own tail and say &quot;SON OF A B!TCH.&quot;  See what I mean.

But I must congratulate him over what he achieved in this one: managing to mix his patented bawdy humor with the innocent and chaotic tale of destruction that ""The Cat in the Hat"" is.And he succeeds wonderfully; Myers only misses a beat twice in the movie. One, is when he overacts as a ""couch mechanic"" (you ought to see it) and wrestles with an elephant trunk. It's curious, since it's the sort of weird humor I enjoy and write about, but he only managed to make me frown in that scene.Which killed Mr. Myers' comedic pacing a little. Good thing he recovers quickly and more zany fun ensues. His second misstep is with the S.L.O.W. vehicle; it'd usually lend itself to more silly mischief, but I guess that's a prop he didn't know how to milk properly.My favorite scene, though, was the one where he pokes fun at stupid infomercials; he's absolutely at his best there.Overall, and in spite of these tiny flaws, I really enjoyed this movie. I recommend it heartily, but I also advise you to rent this movie first, before plunging your cash into it. You know how that warning goes: ""your sense of humor may vary"".

The biggest problem I have with this film, is that not only are there naughty jokes for adults, but they are jokes that kids understand. Disney is good about putting jokes in their films that adults will laugh at and kids won't understand. Jokes parents will take offense to are the cat calling a rake &quot;a dirty hoe&quot; and than kissing it, the cat cutting off his tale and than begining to yell the B word which gets bleeped, and the cat singing about being neutered. Small children won't understand the jokes, but when the kid turns 8, you should stop letting them watch it untill they are 13. The storyline is that one day when Sally and Comrade's mom leaves them with a sleeping babysitter, a mysterious talking cat with his magic hat comes to teach them what being a kid is all about. There isn't actually enough story to fill 90 minutes. The film is basically joke after joke after joke.This DVD release is very good. The behind the scenes footage isn't as indepth as I would like it to be, but it is enough to let you know how they made the movie. I am surprised to find that Universal didn't go the Disney route with this DVD and add a ton of games. There is only one special feature that kids will want to do, and that is the learn to dance like the cat feature. The deleted scenes are nice, and some of them include early special effects. A decent DVD.The best part about this movie is Thing 1 and Thing 2. They are wacky and hilarious. This movie isn't sutible for every member of the family, and parents with kids who repeat everything they hear should not let their kids watch &quot;The Cat In The Hat.&quot;",3,"Hilarious, But Naughty",1081641600,"04 11, 2004",2004,1739,"['quot', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'quot', 'feature', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'platform', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'dress', 'up', 'get', 'goofy', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'naughty', 'jokes', 'adults', 'are', 'jokes', 'kids', 'understand', 'Disney', 'good', 'putting', 'jokes', 'films', 'adults', 'will', 'laugh', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Jokes', 'parents', 'will', 'take', 'offense', 'are', 'cat', 'calling', 'rake', 'quot', 'dirty', 'hoe', 'quot', 'kissing', 'cat', 'cutting', 'off', 'tale', 'begining', 'yell', 'B', 'word', 'bleeped', 'cat', 'singing', 'being', 'neutered', 'Small', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'jokes', 'when', 'kid', '8', 'should', 'stop', 'letting', 'watch', 'are', '13', 'storyline', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'Sally', 'Comrade', 'mom', 'sleeping', 'babysitter', 'mysterious', 'talking', 'cat', 'magic', 'hat', 'teach', 'what', 'being', 'kid', 'about', ""n't"", 'actually', 'enough', 'story', 'fill', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'basically', 'joke', 'joke', 'joke.This', 'DVD', 'release', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'footage', ""n't"", 'as', 'indepth', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'enough', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'made', 'movie', 'am', 'surprised', 'find', 'Universal', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'Disney', 'route', 'DVD', 'add', 'ton', 'games', 'only', 'one', 'special', 'feature', 'kids', 'will', 'want', 'do', 'learn', 'dance', 'cat', 'feature', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'nice', 'include', 'early', 'special', 'effects', 'decent', 'DVD.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'Thing', '1', 'Thing', '2', 'are', 'wacky', 'hilarious', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sutible', 'member', 'family', 'parents', 'kids', 'who', 'repeat', 'everything', 'hear', 'should', 'not', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'quot', 'Cat', 'Hat.', 'quot']",Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat

Even though his performance of the Cat in the Hat at times reminded me of the Cowardly Lion or Snagglepuss with an Austin Powers laugh, Mike Myers does make the cat come to life. The children in the movie do a great job as well.The scenery of the film stayed true to the world of Dr. Seuss and looked great, even though much of it was once again not in the book. It looked like I was watching a Seuss book come to life.I was surprised with how many adult jokes made it into the film, not that it bothered me, but I wouldn't expect some of the things hinted at would be hinted at in a movie based on a children's classic. It's kind of like watching Shrek, adults will get some jokes that kids might not get.Overall a good movie, but if you are expecting this to be exactly like the book, you are going to be very disappointed because this is almost nothing like the book.

So the prospect of bringing it to the world of film for kids to be re-introduced to its magic (which worked for The Grinch) seemed like a great idea.It WAS a good idea.This movie, however, is about as fun as a hairball. It takes the basic story of little kids Sally and Conrad, their fish, and the mischievous talking cat who makes their rainy day more interesting and stomps on it with adult jokes, lame impersonations, unpleasant supporting characters, and just plain stupidity. Mike Myers is a very funny guy, but here he's like a retarded Cowardly Lion on speed, turning into cooking show hosts, plumbers, pinatas, salsa dancers, and so on, each and every one of them 100% not funny. Throw in double entendres that could be almost acceptable if they were actually FUNNY (The Cat steps on a hoe and says, 'Dirty ho.' Not funny. Oh, but then he brings it BACK and starts to put his TONGUE ON IT. HA HA HA! LAUGH!)I'm going into a rant now. I guess the movie is fun for kids that just like noise and silly voices or stoners or people who hate the book, or even people willing to see the movie as a Mike Myers vehicle like Austin Powers. I, however, found it to be one of the worst adaptations of anything, and I just pray there won't be a sequel (there's a second book, though. Yikes.)Oh, and Alec Baldwin, who plays the sleazy neighbor? He skipped the Oscars, where he was nominated, to record commentary for this movie. I thought he was the SMART Baldwin.",1,"Ha ha ha!

I mean, for one thing they have such a VERY materialistic interpretation of Dr. Seuss' artistic vision. I seem to recall his characters being realistic, and his view of things surreal, yet capturing reality fairly well. And the kids in the story were like REAL kids, not Holloywoodish pretty-faced children.Mike Myers is a brilliant character actor; there can be no argument there. (Frankly, I don't find him to be at all funny however.) But, his take on the Cat in the Hat character is, well, disturbing. It's like watching a VERY adult comedy making fun of kids' films. And ADULT is how I would describe it, as there is an awful lot of (strange, and disturbing) sexual humor here. It seems to me like this film is a complete bastardization of Seuss. Despite what critics think, I'd recommend watching Jim Carrey's brilliant performance in ""the Grinch"" before watching this flop. (Not that it was such a good film either.)The DVD design here is kinda cheap. They tried to add some nice features, but it all seemed trashy to me.

614702,A2LEJKP03PF8ZG,B00005JM7T,"Jason Roberts ""Von Munster""","[4, 6]","I simply don't understand all the poor reviews on this film. I think it proves that many of the people who went to see this film had no idea of what to expect from Dreamworks and Mike Myers. If you like the Austin Powers movies you will really like this. No it wasn't some dumb children's Disney movie. It was edgy and had a more of a sophisticated interpretation of the original Dr. Seuss book.I'm guessing the problem is that most of those were expecting a re-enactment of the original children's book. And I doubt seriously Mike Myers or Dreamworks would do such a movie as that. My philosophy on movie and books is simply they are not one and of the same. The children's classic The Cat In the Hat was meant to be one of the first books a child could learn to read. It featured a wonderful use of colorful words to go along with the wonderful illustrations of that era of printed children's publishing. If that is what one expects then they would be best just stick to the classic original children's book. I would wager a bet that most of the parents who complained about this movie never bothered to give their children the book. Instead they just take their brats to the multiplex and expect them to have the same experience as actually reading the children's book.No this is a highly entertaining and humorous critic of modern American life. The character of Mr. Humberfloob (Sean Hayes) and Quinn (Alec Baldwin) along with the mom played by Kelly Preston and the two wonderful child actors do in fact present a satire of modern life. No, children like Sally did not have Palm Pilot organizers in the original book. And no the children in the original book were not as uptight and materialistic as those of 2003. So naturally the Cat (Mike Myers) had to be more sophisticated and edgy.Bottom line this movie is a view of modern day life in uptight urban America. It simply follows the storyline from Dr. Seuss's children's book. It was not meant to be a remake of the printed book. And if there are those out there that thought so then God help them.

I mean I always thought of the characters as classy and Jim Carrey and Mike Myers made them hyper-active and rauncy. Still I like the look of the films and they do manage to have some imagination to them. It's just that they have so much energy and the story is so much all over the place that they wear out the viewer by the time they're over.When you think about it, the cat in the hat is just teaching the kids in the movie what not to do.

Bernabo,"[10, 14]","The idea that Mike Meyers was going to play the title character in &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; certainly sounded like a good idea and the makeup job is pretty good, but as soon as he shows up in this 2003 film and starts channeling either Bert Lahr or Linda Richman (I am not sure which) for some reason you get a bad feeling.  When you add an inane subplot involving Alec Baldwin as a neighbor with plans for the mom (Kelly Preston) of precocious kids Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and Sally (Dakota Fanning), that bad feeling only grows and then comes the point where you realize that this film is just not funny and that is game, set, match for one of the most disappointing children's films ever made.There are some good points to the film.  Redoing the Dreamworks bit at the start of the movie in the illustration style of Dr. Seuss was a nice touch and the production design by Alex McDowell(currently working on &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;) is in keeping with the spirit of the beloved author and his cherished book.  But then people start showing up and talking, at which point your mind is consumed with visions of frantic grave spinning.  Adults love the book too and our fond memories of reading it for the first gazillion couple of times is what draws us here, not the promise of adult humor directed narrowly above the heads of the small fry.I am not really all that concerned with how much of the blame has to do with Meyers and his presence, both in terms of ad libs and writing to his peculiar style of humor, and how much is because screenwriters Alec Berg, David Mandel, and Jeff Schaffer were trying to expand the story to fill up a great big movie like this one.  The added sibling rivalry element is fine (he is compulsively messing up and she is a control freak), but letting Baldwin run around and be annoying was a big mistake while the bits with mom's job and the baby sitter were both unnecessary.  The original story of &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; was about what happened between two kids and the Cat in the Hat while their mother was not about.  There was an irate fish and the troublemaking twins Thing 1 and Thing 2, but that was it and if the people making this movie could not make it work with those characters then tossing in this other nonsense was not going to help.The humor represented by what Baldwin's Quinn does and what happens to the babysitter Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill) are both way beyond the pale.  Dr. Seuss did not do potty jokes nor was he malicious.  Theodore Geisel was creative and imaginative, while those responsible for this travesty are woefully bereft of those qualities.  Dr. Seuss wrote stories to inspire children to read and here the goal is to make money (certainly they made a lot less than they thought they would: the film cost $109 million and grossed only $100 million domestically).  I would want to draw some lesson for future reference having to do with never trying to turn Dr. Seuss into anything more than a half-hour television program and not a bloated 82-minute constrosity, but we all know that Hollywood is slow to learn anything.  Apparently there are some people not even Dr. Seuss can teach.",2,They didn't listen to the tagline: &quot;Don't mess with the hat&quot;,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,3186,"['idea', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'title', 'character', 'quot', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'quot', 'certainly', 'sounded', 'good', 'idea', 'makeup', 'job', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'soon', 'up', '2003', 'film', 'channeling', 'Bert', 'Lahr', 'Linda', 'Richman', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'reason', 'get', 'bad', 'feeling', 'When', 'add', 'inane', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'neighbor', 'plans', 'mom', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'precocious', 'kids', 'Conrad', 'Spencer', 'Breslin', 'Sally', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'bad', 'feeling', 'only', 'grows', 'then', 'point', 'where', 'realize', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'game', 'set', 'match', 'one', 'most', 'disappointing', 'children', 'films', 'ever', 'are', 'good', 'points', 'film', 'Redoing', 'Dreamworks', 'bit', 'start', 'movie', 'illustration', 'style', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'production', 'design', 'Alex', 'McDowell', 'currently', 'working', 'quot', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'quot', 'keeping', 'spirit', 'beloved', 'author', 'cherished', 'book', 'then', 'people', 'start', 'showing', 'up', 'talking', 'point', 'mind', 'consumed', 'visions', 'frantic', 'grave', 'spinning', 'Adults', 'love', 'book', 'too', 'fond', 'memories', 'reading', 'first', 'gazillion', 'couple', 'times', 'what', 'here', 'not', 'promise', 'adult', 'humor', 'directed', 'narrowly', 'heads', 'small', 'fry.I', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'concerned', 'how', 'much', 'blame', 'do', 'Meyers', 'presence', 'terms', 'ad', 'libs', 'writing', 'peculiar', 'style', 'humor', 'how', 'much', 'screenwriters', 'Alec', 'Berg', 'David', 'Mandel', 'Jeff', 'Schaffer', 'were', 'trying', 'expand', 'story', 'fill', 'up', 'great', 'big', 'movie', 'one', 'added', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'element', 'fine', 'compulsively', 'messing', 'up', 'control', 'freak', 'letting', 'Baldwin', 'run', 'around', 'be', 'annoying', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'bits', 'mom', 'job', 'baby', 'sitter', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'original', 'story', 'quot', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'quot', 'was', 'what', 'happened', 'two', 'kids', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'mother', 'was', 'not', 'about', 'was', 'irate', 'fish', 'troublemaking', 'Thing', '1', 'Thing', '2', 'was', 'people', 'making', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'work', 'characters', 'then', 'tossing', 'other', 'nonsense', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'help.The', 'humor', 'represented', 'what', 'Baldwin', 'Quinn', 'what', 'babysitter', 'Mrs.', 'Kwan', 'Amy', 'Hill', 'are', 'way', 'pale', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'potty', 'jokes', 'was', 'malicious', 'Theodore', 'Geisel', 'was', 'creative', 'imaginative', 'responsible', 'travesty', 'are', 'woefully', 'bereft', 'qualities', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'wrote', 'stories', 'inspire', 'children', 'read', 'here', 'goal', 'make', 'money', 'certainly', 'made', 'lot', 'less', 'thought', 'would', 'film', 'cost', '109', 'million', 'grossed', 'only', '100', 'million', 'domestically', 'would', 'want', 'draw', 'lesson', 'future', 'reference', 'having', 'do', 'never', 'trying', 'turn', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'anything', 'more', 'half-hour', 'television', 'program', 'not', 'bloated', '82-minute', 'constrosity', 'know', 'Hollywood', 'slow', 'learn', 'anything', 'Apparently', 'are', 'people', 'not', 'even', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'can', 'teach']",Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[4, 7]","If you thought that film production companies such as Dream Works, Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment would be able to transform a $109-million budget, an all-star cast and a very famous Dr. Seuss (a.k.a. Theodor S. Geisel, 1904-1991) children's book into a hit film in 2003, you were mistaken.  Instead, the film production of ""The Cat in the Hat"", starring Mike Myers and Alec Baldwin and directed by Bo Welch, was a box-office disaster of epic proportions: earning a paltry $38-million in gross U.S. box-office receipts.  In spite of the lavish sets, costumes and special effects done in a myriad of bright, pastel colors and superb makeup that visually transformed Mike Myers into Seuss's infamous cat, the dialog, acting and side plot utterly failed to inspire, engage, entertain or capture the imaginations of the audience.  Except for a scant number of infrequent jokes that inspired brief responses of laughter, the majority of the film's 82 minutes are dry, humorless and dull.The film begins in a Seuss-inspired township of imaginative colors and architecture in the real estate firm owned by Mr. Humberfloob (Sean Hayes, better known for his portrayal of Jack in the ongoing TV sitcom of ""Will & Grace""), who suffers from an obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Though intended to be funny, Mr. Humberfloob's yelling is merely annoying.  Working for him is the mother (Kelly Preston) of the two children that will soon be visited by Mike Myer's vision of Seuss's cat.  While being babysat by the overly drowsy Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill), the children, the disobedient Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and the peremptory Sally (Dakota Fanning), are visited mysteriously by Mike Myers as the Cat in the Hat.  Not having been engaged by any of the characters thus far, Mike Myers arrival is disappointing as he proceeds to vapidly attempt to humor the children out of their boredom and bad behavior.  The most interesting characters, Thing One (Danielle Chuchran & Taylor Rice) and Thing Two (Brittany Oaks & Talia-Lynn Prairie), are by far the most entertaining characters in the film.  Alec Baldwin as the mother's would-be suitor/neighbor named Quinn (a product of poetic license), is often offensive and utterly humorless.Though the cinematography and special effects are quite good, these alone could not save this film's inability to be in any way entertaining.  It is conceivable that Jim Carrey (who did an excellent job of playing Seuss's grinch in the 2000 ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"") would have been better able to portray the Cat in the Hat as compared to Mike Myers, but that is something that will probably never be known.  Sadly, the best that I can rate the 2003 film version of ""The Cat in the Hat"" is 2 out of 5 stars.

Lira,"[1, 2]","When I first heard that a movie was being made based on one of my favorite childhood books, THE CAT IN THE HAT, I was excited and wanted to see it. I was even more excited when I heard one of my favorite actors, Mike Myers, would be playing the lead. I finally got a chance to see the movie tonight, and was absolutely dissopointed. I won't even bother comparing the movie to the book, as the two are completely seperate things.As I said, Mike Myers is one of my favorite actors, and I've come to expect a lot of things from him. His role in this film wasn't one of them. This film wasn't at all what I expected. The two musical numbers were announced instead of spontaneous, as in THE GRINCH. The first was extremely corny while the second was definately not needed.The humor of the movie also didn't agree with me. Although it has a PG rating, I wouldn't reccomend this film for anyone below the age of 16. The minor sub-plot with the Cat's lawyers was definately not necessary, and the two near-occurances of cussing were very uncalled for. Definately not needed for this film. I'm not a prudish person, but I do know the difference between crude and funny. This film was mostly crude and crass. I am just glad I didn't waste 8bucks at the theater watching it.If you're a big fan of Dr. Seuss' book, I highly reccomend that you AVOI THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!! I give it 2 stars only because the children (Fanning and Breslin) were terrific in their roles. Mike Myers - this was definately not your finest hour.",2,The hat's off.

I plan the movie to be as successful if not more successful than &quot;How The Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, which is another film made from the Dr.Seuss classics.I waited until the movie came out on VHS a couple of days before renting this movie and I have to say, the movie was very disappointing. Seemingly made for the kiddies, it seems to me that directors simply didn't have a break through or an eye opener during the making of this movie. The graphics aren't utilized to its extent, rather, just to add a little extra to the movie. Its like old classic Chinese fighting series where they first grasp the technology. An mere experiment, nothing serious. A movie which should have went straight to VHS and didn't deserve the spotlights of the theater.The plot was way too straight forward and predictable, therefore making it uninteresting. The Cat and the kids were just simply characterless in my opinion. The Cat being just goofy and annoying, while the kids seem like any other kids you've ever seen. Nothing what it should be, nothing really &quot;unique&quot; or much of an &quot;originality&quot; from the rest. The jokes played in the movie was very childish as well and appeals, therefore, to the younger audience in the most part.What adds to the nightmare is the fact that the scenary wasn't well thought up of and things aren't nearly as creative as &quot;How The Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;.

They are adaptations of those works, and thus entities into themselves. But with this unnecessarily complicated film of the simple, endearing Dr. Seuss classic, there's nothing to do here but complain. Why they would adapt a children's book that takes less than 10 minutes to read to a child into an 82-minute feature is beyond me.There is literally nothing at all good about this movie. Not a single thing whatsoever. Mike Myers plays the cat as if he were someone's oafish, annoying uncle from Queens doing a botched magic act. He often reverts to variations on his old SNL schticks to keep things from going downhill and fails miserably.The script, if it could be called such, clogs up the film's simple message of mixing fun with caution with an unnecessary subplot. Alec Baldwin's character of a loutish, hateful suitor to the children's mother wants to send the boy (the decidedly un-cute Spencer Breslin) to military school. After seeing the way the kids act in this film, he may be right, but the subplot could have been cut.Many of the other new characters are just window dressing. Talented character actress Amy Hill is wasted as a fat, narcoleptic Taiwanese babysitter does absolutely nothing at all. Sean Hayes (who ruins everything he's in) is there as the mother's boss only to suggest that Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is innately funny. As the voice of the goldfish, Hayes provides no charm or humor, just yelling and screaming.For an alleged family film, this production is unbelievably vulgar and obscene. There is a sequence in a rave, of all places, and who else makes a cameo but amateur filmmaker (to use a polite phrase) Paris Hilton.First-time director Bo Welch has no sense of comic timing or pacing whatsoever, and for a film that plays as if it were on fast forward, it seems awfully long. Considering his production design background, one would think he'd use colors other than purple, green, and orange for the hideous, expensive sets.Do not, under any circumstances, view this vile, crass, obscene, offensive, annoying film in any way shape or form.

614741,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JM7T,Roland E. Zwick,"[11, 15]","Perhaps with ""Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,"" we can finally declare an official moratorium on any future live-action film adaptations of that beloved author's classic work.  This is an even more egregious fiasco than the earlier ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" the film that stands, shockingly and inexplicably, as the box office champion of 2000.  (Oh well, at least ""The Cat in the Hat"" didn't emerge as the highest-grossing film of 2003. We should at least be grateful for small favors, I guess).Mike Myers embarrasses himself to no end playing the crazed feline who bursts into the lives of two bored youngsters one dull rainy afternoon.  Myers' interpretation of the cat seems to derive its inspiration from the Charles Nelson Reilly school of lowbrow comedy. Though the film borrows the basic premise from the book, the screenplay and direction do everything possible to violate the spirit of the source, replacing the original's cleverness, subtlety and literary wit with manic pacing, unctuous caricatures, and foul, inappropriately sexual and scatological humor.  The film's production design is indeed a wonder to behold, capturing the parti-colored splendor of the original book's illustrations to a tee.  This is not, however, the case with the bizarre and repulsive suit the costume designers have fashioned for Meyers to inhabit.  Indeed, the only thing saving Myers from total embarrassment here is the fact that the mask he's been forced to don at least hides his identity to some meager extent (poor Alec Baldwin, as a particularly obnoxious secondary character, is given no such protective covering to hide HIS understandably reddened face behind).Unlike the classic tale on which it is based, ""The Cat in the Hat"" is a soulless, joyless enterprise that will depress generations of children to come as well as the bewildered adults who will be joining them in the experience.  Really, who of any age wants to look at a cat's naked posterior or Baldwin's prosthetic beer belly, both of which are given ample and merciless display here?  What a sad state Hollywood has come to when this is what movie moguls think passes for fine cinematic fun for the whole family.",1,great visuals; terrible everything else,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,2184,"['Perhaps', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'can', 'finally', 'declare', 'official', 'moratorium', 'future', 'live-action', 'film', 'adaptations', 'beloved', 'author', 'classic', 'work', 'even', 'more', 'egregious', 'fiasco', 'earlier', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'film', 'shockingly', 'inexplicably', 'box', 'office', 'champion', '2000', 'Oh', 'well', 'least', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'did', ""n't"", 'emerge', 'highest-grossing', 'film', '2003', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'grateful', 'small', 'favors', 'guess', 'Myers', 'end', 'playing', 'crazed', 'feline', 'who', 'lives', 'two', 'bored', 'youngsters', 'one', 'dull', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'Myers', 'interpretation', 'cat', 'derive', 'inspiration', 'Charles', 'Nelson', 'Reilly', 'school', 'lowbrow', 'comedy', 'film', 'basic', 'premise', 'book', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'do', 'everything', 'possible', 'violate', 'spirit', 'source', 'replacing', 'original', 'cleverness', 'subtlety', 'literary', 'wit', 'manic', 'pacing', 'unctuous', 'caricatures', 'foul', 'inappropriately', 'sexual', 'scatological', 'humor', 'film', 'production', 'design', 'indeed', 'wonder', 'behold', 'capturing', 'parti-colored', 'splendor', 'original', 'book', 'illustrations', 'tee', 'not', 'however', 'case', 'bizarre', 'repulsive', 'suit', 'costume', 'designers', 'have', 'fashioned', 'Meyers', 'inhabit', 'Indeed', 'only', 'thing', 'saving', 'Myers', 'total', 'embarrassment', 'here', 'fact', 'mask', 'been', 'forced', 'don', 'least', 'hides', 'identity', 'meager', 'extent', 'poor', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'particularly', 'obnoxious', 'secondary', 'character', 'given', 'such', 'protective', 'covering', 'hide', 'HIS', 'understandably', 'reddened', 'face', 'classic', 'tale', 'based', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'soulless', 'joyless', 'enterprise', 'will', 'depress', 'generations', 'children', 'come', 'as', 'well', 'bewildered', 'adults', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'joining', 'experience', 'Really', 'who', 'age', 'look', 'cat', 'naked', 'posterior', 'Baldwin', 'prosthetic', 'beer', 'belly', 'are', 'given', 'ample', 'merciless', 'display', 'here', 'What', 'sad', 'state', 'Hollywood', 'come', 'when', 'what', 'movie', 'moguls', 'think', 'passes', 'fine', 'cinematic', 'fun', 'whole', 'family']",Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat
614742,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JM7T,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 6]","Oh, where to start.  No surprises here - this is a flick that will do anything for a kid's laugh, even if that means it will send Seussians into a frenzy, or have Seuss himself doing 360's in his grave.  Let's get the bad out of the way - this flick is simplistic, goes for the easy laugh, relies heavily on expensive production and special effects and makes no attempt to build on the magic of the story and milks it dry.  Worse, it doesn't even use the extended length of what was originally a story you could read in a few minutes to develop its own magic.That said (and now that we know we're not going to see Seuss get his due), ""Cat"" is still fun.  If unsurprising, it manages to satisfy.  Everybody knows the story - Conrad and Sally, brother and sister, are waiting out a rainy day at home when (for no reason, and without any explanation) the cat appears and begins to tear up the house for laughs.  Soon the cat enlists the aid of Thing #1 and Thing #2.  The movie stretches things out - Conrad (who was the nameless narrator of the story - the cat can never get his name right here in one of the movie's running jokes) is a rascal who never does what he's supposed to; Sally is a control freak and compulsively complies with rules (she envies Conrad who has more rules than she does).  Their mother (played by the lovely Kelly Preston) will be hosting a party at home for her boss - a real estate super-agent with a Seussian name and a nasty obsession for sanitary hands.  Meanwhile, a sinister neighbor (Alec Baldwin) with an eye on Mom, conspires to get Conrad into a military school in order to remove an obstacle between himself and mom.  Obviously, the cat will teach the kids to find the happy medium of spontaneous fun of less-than-mass-destruction, while thwarting the evil Baldwin character.  Meyers plays the cat as a mix of his ""Coffee Talk"" lady and a more jovial version of Burt Lahr's ""Cowardly Lion"".  Meyers is irrepressible as the Cat, and if he misses the story's, he captures the movie's conceit, which is well aware of how short it falls from the original (Myers's cat kicks things off once Conrad and Sally sign a bunch of legal waivers; the cat also never goes anywhere without his magical, time-traveling elves, a trio of uptight suits who only look like lawyers; Myers also proves rather limited in the rhyme department).Dedicated Seussians aside, it could have been a lot worse - preachy, treacly or simply infantile like some extended Nickelodeon cartoon - ""Cat"" has decent laughs and won't put you to sleep like more acceptable kiddie fair.  Warning though, this flick more closely straddles the line of good taste than other kid-flicks - with several near utterances of not-ready-for Niktoons dialog and plenty of double-entendres which will have you thinking ""isn't this supposed to be a kids' movie?"" (not to mention Myers as plumber, complete with sagging hip-hugger jeans), but I doubt most kids will pick up on them.  I took my 4 and 6 year olders to see it and we all had a ball.  On the other hand, I've finally found a kids flick I can enjoy as much as my kids do (even if the enjoyment ain't that great).  In short, if you are a true devotee of Suess, you'll probably want to stick clear of this flick (catch ""Return of the King"" instead, if accuracy and loyalty are your creeds).  Otherwise, this flick is still fun.",3,Fun (unless you're a diehard Seussian - then one star),1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,3365,"['Oh', 'where', 'start', 'surprises', 'here', 'flick', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'kid', 'laugh', 'even', 'will', 'send', 'Seussians', 'frenzy', 'have', 'Seuss', 'doing', '360', 'grave', 'Let', 'get', 'bad', 'way', 'flick', 'simplistic', 'easy', 'laugh', 'heavily', 'expensive', 'production', 'special', 'effects', 'attempt', 'build', 'magic', 'story', 'milks', 'dry', 'Worse', ""n't"", 'even', 'use', 'extended', 'length', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'story', 'could', 'read', 'few', 'minutes', 'develop', 'own', 'magic.That', 'said', 'now', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'see', 'Seuss', 'get', 'due', 'Cat', 'still', 'fun', 'unsurprising', 'satisfy', 'Everybody', 'story', 'Conrad', 'Sally', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'waiting', 'out', 'rainy', 'day', 'home', 'when', 'reason', 'explanation', 'cat', 'tear', 'up', 'house', 'laughs', 'Soon', 'cat', 'aid', 'Thing', '1', 'Thing', '2', 'movie', 'stretches', 'things', 'out', 'Conrad', 'who', 'was', 'nameless', 'narrator', 'story', 'cat', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'name', 'right', 'here', 'one', 'movie', 'running', 'jokes', 'rascal', 'who', 'never', 'what', 'supposed', 'Sally', 'control', 'freak', 'compulsively', 'complies', 'rules', 'Conrad', 'who', 'more', 'rules', 'mother', 'played', 'lovely', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'will', 'be', 'hosting', 'party', 'home', 'boss', 'real', 'estate', 'super-agent', 'Seussian', 'name', 'nasty', 'obsession', 'sanitary', 'hands', 'Meanwhile', 'sinister', 'neighbor', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'eye', 'Mom', 'get', 'Conrad', 'military', 'school', 'order', 'remove', 'obstacle', 'mom', 'Obviously', 'cat', 'will', 'teach', 'kids', 'find', 'happy', 'medium', 'spontaneous', 'fun', 'less-than-mass-destruction', 'thwarting', 'evil', 'Baldwin', 'character', 'Meyers', 'cat', 'mix', 'Coffee', 'Talk', 'lady', 'more', 'jovial', 'version', 'Burt', 'Lahr', 'Cowardly', 'Lion', 'Meyers', 'irrepressible', 'Cat', 'story', 'movie', 'conceit', 'well', 'aware', 'how', 'short', 'original', 'Myers', 'cat', 'kicks', 'things', 'off', 'once', 'Conrad', 'Sally', 'sign', 'bunch', 'legal', 'waivers', 'cat', 'also', 'never', 'anywhere', 'magical', 'time-traveling', 'elves', 'trio', 'uptight', 'suits', 'who', 'only', 'look', 'lawyers', 'Myers', 'also', 'rather', 'limited', 'rhyme', 'department', '.Dedicated', 'Seussians', 'aside', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'worse', 'preachy', 'treacly', 'simply', 'infantile', 'extended', 'Nickelodeon', 'cartoon', 'Cat', 'decent', 'laughs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'sleep', 'more', 'acceptable', 'kiddie', 'fair', 'Warning', 'flick', 'more', 'closely', 'line', 'good', 'taste', 'other', 'kid-flicks', 'several', 'utterances', 'not-ready-for', 'Niktoons', 'dialog', 'plenty', 'double-entendres', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'kids', 'movie', 'not', 'mention', 'Myers', 'plumber', 'complete', 'sagging', 'hip-hugger', 'jeans', 'doubt', 'most', 'kids', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'took', '4', '6', 'year', 'olders', 'see', 'had', 'ball', 'other', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'found', 'kids', 'flick', 'can', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'kids', 'do', 'even', 'enjoyment', 'ai', ""n't"", 'great', 'short', 'are', 'true', 'devotee', 'Suess', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'stick', 'clear', 'flick', 'catch', 'Return', 'King', 'instead', 'accuracy', 'loyalty', 'are', 'creeds', 'Otherwise', 'flick', 'still', 'fun']",Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat

Critics, Suess fans and the movie going public would all like to see every last copy of this film destroyed.  Ironically, it was all this negative press that made me want to watch this film, so my daughter and I made a night out of it and watched.  This is one of those Hollywood goof ups that comes along once in awhile.  These are the kinds of movies I live for.  It was obviously intended to be a film aimed at kids, but ends up being more bizarre and disturbing than intended(or was it intended?) much like The Garbage Pail Kids movie or Return To Oz.  The movie is a total overdose of utter zaniness and the bizarre.  In fact, the onlsaught may be too overwhelming for some adults.  Mark my words, this has &quot;cult film&quot; written all over it.  Years from now(if not already), this film will achieve a cult following for those into whacked out movies.  I promise.  To all the conservative parents whining about how &quot;crude&quot; and &quot;Inappropriate&quot; some of the jokes are-Lighten up a bit.  These suggestive themes are shot out so fast that only adults are gonna pick up on them.  Really, they'll fly over your kids' heads, coz they'll be preoccupied with the physical comedy and the overall look of the film.  After viewing, my daughter had no desire to go to a rave, hit on Paris Hilton, call a hoe a &quot;ho&quot;, use profanity or whack a guy in the groin with a baseball bat.  Your kids are safe, lighten up a bit.  And if you're kids are old enough to get these jokes, then I'd hope they'd be mature enough to handle them and laugh at them.  I mean, it's not Andrew Dice Clay or anything.  To Dr. Suess fans, I agree with the other reviewers and suggest you stay away.  I hate it when Hollywood butchers a book I like(Hannibal comes to mind), and this is no exception.  But if you like just flat out bizarre stuff, check this out.  Regardless of complaints, this movie is actually very funny, very witty.  Especially a scene where the Cat spoofs that lame informercial show, Amazing Discoveries, that used to be on every morning at 5 a.m.(almost always the same episode with that crazy English guy trying to sell that magic car rejuvination wax or Jack Lelane and his Juice Tiger).

As the movie opens, Jane (Kelly Preston) is at work, and her boss (Sean Hayes) is giving a speech about that night's company party that Jane is holding, and her boss tells her that the house should be in shape or she is &quot;fired&quot;, just after recieveing word that her baby sitter for her children Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and Sally (Dakota Fanning) is leaving the house, and has to leave to be with her children, she is a single Mom, and there is no word of what happended to thier father. She wroks as a ral estate agent, while at the house, Conrad (who is a rule breaker) and does the oppioste of what he is told, slides down the stairs, and who should catch in the act, but his Mom, and he goes out the front door, leading his Mom to be mad with him, for getting her dress for the party almost dirty, which leads him to being grounded for a week. But then she gets a call from her boss, and he wants her to return back to work that day, reason (not really given), which leads to Jane getting a bab sittter for her children at the last mintue, and she manges to get Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill). And she leaves some rules for both children, and lets Mrs. Kwan know that Conrad is grounded. Thier next door neighbor and Jane Boyfriend Lawwerence Quinn (Alec Bladwin) hates Conrad, and wants to send him to a special school for troubled boys. And when it starts to rain, and they are stuck in the house, with nothing to do. Until they here a noise in the house leads to find out, what is going on. Enter the Cat in the Hat (Mike Myers), which the kids are scared of at first.

614758,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JM7T,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","In Japan, where Dakota Fanning is very popular (perhaps more popular than Mike Myers), 'Dr. Seuss's The Cat in the Hat' went straight to video when the year 2004 was almost over.  What is the reason for this reluctant distribution?  Why so ... late?Now, I see it.  The film is not only unfunny; it's criminally unfunny and some might call it offensive because of its awfully misguided gags.  Even kids hate it because its hopeless silliness, and their parents find it appalling because of offen suggested sexual nuances.Mike Myers in prosthetics plays the Cat in the Hat, who visits the house of Little Girl Sally (Fanning) and Little Boy Conrad (Spencer Breslin, 'The Kid').  Sally is a girl who prefers thing in order while Conrad likes mischief-making.  Today is a rainy day, so now The Cat can teach them how to 'have fun.'But how?  Within the short running time (barely exceeds 80 minutes), unrecognizable Mike Myers in cat's makeup plays every tricks on the house's spic-and-span interior decorations, which all turn messy.  And he thinks it's funny.  Funny, too for us, that he doesn't seem to think that this is exactly what is happening to his career.The same goes to the adult actors -- Kelly Preston (who should deserve better roles) plays the kids' Mom as she was many times before.  She wants the house to be clean because her boss doesn't like any potentially dirty things (so, he even abhors handshaking ... ho-hum).  And Alec Baldwin is a 'handsome' neighbor who wants to marry her (she is a single mother).  And of course, he wants to get rid of the kids simply because the film needs an obligatory villain.The only merit of the film is its production designs, which  perfectly fit in this fantasy.  The cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki ('And Your Mother Too' 'A Walk in the Cloud') gives the impeccable dream-like pastel-color touch to this fictional town where a cat can talk and a goldfish can speak.  If only they thought of a more decent story, or at least some funnier gags.It is a wonder that among this costly confusion of tasteless, meaningless moments, the child actors can retain theit charms to some extent.

614759,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JM7T,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","To begin with, there are a lot of people out there who have taken this movie way too seriously. THE CAT IN THE HAT is based/inspired by the beloved children's story by Dr. Seuss. The original book has 72 pages that are mostly illustrations. That's not much source material for a movie, even if it is supposed to be a children's movie. So, the filmmakers expanded the Cat's universe, making it more lively, but in a very unrealistic and cartoony fashion. The movie isn't going to make total sense; it's not supposed to. It's based off a Dr. Seuss book, for Pete's sake.The story revolves around a sister and brother, Sally and Conrad, who are driving their poor single Mom insane with their unruly behavior. Their mother warns them that they better not get in trouble and to keep the house clean as she leaves the house. She loves her children, but is it too much to ask that they not fight and keep the house clean for once? But, while Mom is away, the Cat will play. Sally, Conrad, and Cat find out that this guy named Quinn who kind of likes their Mom is actually not what he appears to be. So the trio sets forth on a mission to keep Quinn from proposing to Mom.Mike Myers is a comical genius and perfectly captures the sprite-like nature of Cat. Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are also well cast as Sally and Conrad. Other than that, there really aren't any other notable acting performances except Paris Hilton's brief cameo.As for as movies go, THE CAT IN THE HAT is a disappointment. The characters could have been so much more interesting and the story more developed. Instead, the movie feels like watching a bunch of beautifully painted pictures pasted together to try to tell a story. Of course, that didn't bother me as much as all the innuendo that is in the movie. This is supposed to be a children's movie, but instead comes off being more like a PG-13 teen comedy.

614761,A3TTC70GZ9SH3S,B00005JM7T,ULTRA,"[3, 4]","I get why so many people are upset over this film, especially if you are a parent and are mindful.of what your kids see and hear. I personally don't think it's that bad for children to watch. Kids are more fascinated with a silly looking over-sized cat that talks- in a house with bright and wacky colors and the energy and thrill of the hyperactivity. Kids aren't concerned eith all that dialogue and most of the stuff thats meant to be funny is over their heads anyway. Seriously. However, I do understand if someone would prefer for their children not to watch it which in my mind is ridiculous. It's not that serious, I've seen much worse on Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies growing up. A DVD is not going to raise your child, thats YOUR job as a parent. That being said...I give a mild example about something in the film.thats completely over a childs head, they wouldnt get it at all. This is just a sneak peak of the point im making...Example: After the children discover an oversized cat in their house (after running and screaming for 10 mins) they finally realize this cat is ridiculous and harmless. They talk, chat bla bla bla. He pulls out a clipboard with a stack of papers as thick as a phonebook, he hands them pens and asks them to sign and initial where he points his finger. Hes flipping through the contract as theyre signing and refers to a part of the contract as 'Section 8'. He says 'Section 8 of this contract is yada yada yada'. What child would pick that up? The way the term was used was to refer to a particular section in the documents that happened to be the 8th section of the contract. Its silly and easy to miss and if you're a child it most likely will go completely over your head. I picked it up after watching it today. I had the movie since it was released on DVD and just popped it in after 6 or 7 years and I just realized how slick that was lol. Its 'stupid/silly' stuff like this.I wouldn't call it innocent at all, its not a dingy movie. Only a person with life experience would pick up on the humor. A naive child would be completely deaf to all the jokes, its basically like there are no jokes- its like listening to someone speak their native language infront of you and you're completely oblivious to wgat they're saying. You dont even care and you forgot it ever happened.The other two situations that stuck in my head would be when the cat was dressed as Rosarita or Quita Banana (whoever she is...) He was singing in drag and something he was singing about rhymed with 'balls' (as in his ballsack) the music slowed and paused before he could say it- he sits for 4 or 5 secs and thinks of another word (he uses 'boys' instead) and continues singing.Another event was when he was on the homeshopping network or a cooking show similar to a Rachael Rae or Paula Deen. The show is called 'Astounding Products'. Long story, short- he makes a mistake and chops the end of his tail off with a butcher knife, he doesnt realize he did this until Dakota Fanning points it out abd he yells ""SON OF A..."" and an extended bleep sound conceals 'you know the word'.The bottom line is that, I would say this movie is more for kids in 3rd to 5th grade. The humor that I just mentioned is something most 3rd, 4th and 5th grade kids would find retarded but something to smile at. Kids that are younger wouldn't even be listening, and anyone older (like me) cracks up because its so narrow and basic.Would I say this is a good movie? Well, I laugh at stuff thats not supposed to be funny. Im tickled very easily. It's 'stupid' comedy but not over-the-top. What kept me so entertained was the design of the set, the bright colors and how simple the humor was. I think its a cute movie, I like it alot. If im speaking in general I wouldnt say its a great movie. Most movies that get realky goid ratings are usually boring to.me.

They could have done something much better with the story but instead tried to make it funny to both adults and kids. When will writers learn? Either MAKE IT A GROWNUP MOVIE OR MAKE IT A KIDS MOVIE! It's really hard to do both without kids going ""Huh?"" and adults going ""funny but I can't explain it to the kids."" Mike Myers was just UNFUNNY as the cat and his delivery of the jokes was rotten. He's barely funny anyway, (example, Waynes World where Mike is a 40 year old dude playing a teenager..also not funny) why would they put him in this movie? It really comes off like he is trying too hard, it's painful to watch. Jim Carey would have been way funnier as the cat in my opinion. I liked the colorful costumes and houses. Visually it was amazing and captured the look and theme of the book but everything else fell short. The kids acting was pretty good and the ending was funny. It's just too bad they made such a bad choice when casting the Cat. Mike ruined the movie and he was way too over the top. If I never see him 'act' again I would not be upset. The jokes in the movie were way too grown up, kids are smart and sadly a lot of them might actually understand this humor and it sets a bad example. I would not go so far as to say this movie is horrible, it's just not great overall.",2,not great...,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,1397,"['loved', 'book', 'kid', 'too', 'bad', 'had', 'ruin', 'making', 'such', 'lame', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'instead', 'tried', 'make', 'funny', 'adults', 'kids', 'When', 'will', 'writers', 'learn', 'MAKE', 'IT', 'A', 'GROWNUP', 'MOVIE', 'OR', 'MAKE', 'IT', 'A', 'KIDS', 'MOVIE', 'really', 'hard', 'do', 'kids', 'going', 'Huh', 'adults', 'going', 'funny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'kids', 'Myers', 'was', 'just', 'UNFUNNY', 'cat', 'delivery', 'jokes', 'was', 'rotten', 'barely', 'funny', 'anyway', 'example', 'Waynes', 'World', 'where', 'Mike', '40', 'year', 'old', 'dude', 'playing', 'teenager..also', 'not', 'funny', 'why', 'would', 'put', 'movie', 'really', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'painful', 'watch', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'funnier', 'cat', 'opinion', 'liked', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'houses', 'Visually', 'was', 'amazing', 'captured', 'look', 'theme', 'book', 'everything', 'else', 'fell', 'short', 'kids', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'ending', 'was', 'funny', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'made', 'bad', 'choice', 'when', 'casting', 'Cat', 'Mike', 'ruined', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'never', 'see', ""'act"", 'again', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'upset', 'jokes', 'movie', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'grown', 'up', 'kids', 'are', 'smart', 'sadly', 'lot', 'might', 'actually', 'understand', 'humor', 'bad', 'example', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'movie', 'horrible', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'overall']",Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat
