1110787,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,B000WN5DYS,Marty Gillis,"[8, 8]","'All In the Family is a classic series that holds up very well , is still very relevant and just as funny and poignant as it was during the years it was originally shown. The writing and acting is among the very best in all of television.  With that in mind, this review pertains mostly to the DVD sets themselves, the video and audio quality of the discs and the packaging.Unfortunately these sets are now packaged in the one hub stack-able DVD cases, with the discs all sitting on top of each other. The original cases were of the fold out variety and much nicer, but Sony has taken the low road here with these new 'eco-friendly' (read: cheap) cases. For instance, to get at Disc 3 you would need to remove them all to get at it. While they certainly take up less space than some larger multiple disc holders, they are cheap , inconvenient and an insult to this great series.  I immediately went out and purchased 3 disc cases and just transferred the paper insert into each new case.How is the overall video quality of the first 6 Seasons? In a word: Terrible!  'All in the Family' was shot on network quality video tape, presumably 3/4 inch.  It has significantly degraded over the years much like a VHS cassette you have played one too many times. Some episodes have held up better than others, but generally speaking you will get blurry pictures, fading color, banding, streaking, video noise, shifting contrast and color levels (during the same episode) and little red or white dots in various corners of the screen. Sometimes the frame has a vertical line running thru the picture on the right or left side. A few episodes look so bad that even the worst TV Land reception will look better to you. Usually the closeups are pretty clear but not always.Basically what you get with the video is a higher resolution look at old broadcast video tape and much of time it is not a pretty sight. From what I understand the Shout Factory releases of Season 8 and 9 look a far sight better than these do. This leads me to believe that Sony had bad source masters , did a very poor job of transferring, or any combination of those two things.Basically, if you LOVE All in the Family, you will soon get over the fact that these are very very bad to look at. The best they will look would be to play these DVD's on an old standard CRT 4:3 standard definition set. The problems with the video will not be as apparent. But with an HDTV you will see all I have mentioned, and the better resolution you have, the worse these DVD's are going to look.  I personally have them upconverted to 1080p using an Oppo BDP-93 which does wonders for all my DVD's , but in this case it just doesn't help all that much.There are a VERY FEW episodes here and there that almost look good, but that is the extent of it.As for the sound, it was originally recorded in mono along with the video on the  same tape. The sound doesn't suffer quite as much as the picture does. Most of the time it is clear enough but it is far from being high fidelity.  The recordings were only marginal to begin with, nothing special really, so you can't expect much here. Basically, you can see and hear the show, albeit at varying degrees of quality.A few of the shows have very bad sound, but you can still hear what they are saying.'All in the Family' is one of my all time favorite programs and owning every season was something I really felt I needed to do. Unfortunately the quality of these first 6 Seasons distributed by Sony are pretty bad.ON the plus side, you get ALL the shows from the first 6 years, unedited, commercial free and with everything intact, such as the end tags that came after the last commercial before the credits roll. Those haven't been seen in many years, after long being chopped off in editing for syndication.  I have decided to pretty much ignore the bad quality video and just enjoy the show.  If you want ALL of 'All in the Family' uncut and in chronological order, this is your only choice. You might be able to get better quality video from recording TV Land episodes and editing out the commercials yourself, but you will not have the entire program as they chop a good 5 minutes at the very  least out of them. Bottom line, if you  love ""All in the Family' then you will be happy you bought this. (eventually) If you are expecting great or even good quality video transfers, this is not the set for you.  Remember, the better your TV is, the worse this will look.Even with all the problems with these transfers I still totally recommend this series. It is SO GOOD that the show rises above the lousy transfers. As such I still give this selection FIVE STARS although I would give the transfer and packaging only 2 and 1/2 stars.",5,Top Notch Program w/ Terrible Transfers and Packaging!,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,4727,"[""'All"", 'Family', 'classic', 'series', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'still', 'very', 'relevant', 'just', 'funny', 'poignant', 'was', 'years', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', 'writing', 'acting', 'very', 'best', 'television', 'mind', 'review', 'mostly', 'DVD', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'discs', 'packaging.Unfortunately', 'sets', 'are', 'now', 'packaged', 'one', 'hub', 'stack-able', 'DVD', 'cases', 'discs', 'sitting', 'top', 'other', 'original', 'cases', 'were', 'fold', 'out', 'variety', 'much', 'nicer', 'Sony', 'taken', 'low', 'road', 'here', 'new', ""'eco-friendly"", 'read', 'cheap', 'cases', 'instance', 'get', 'Disc', '3', 'would', 'need', 'remove', 'get', 'certainly', 'take', 'up', 'less', 'space', 'larger', 'multiple', 'disc', 'holders', 'are', 'cheap', 'inconvenient', 'insult', 'great', 'series', 'immediately', 'went', 'purchased', '3', 'disc', 'cases', 'just', 'transferred', 'paper', 'insert', 'new', 'case.How', 'overall', 'video', 'quality', 'first', '6', 'Seasons', 'word', 'Terrible', ""'All"", 'Family', 'was', 'shot', 'network', 'quality', 'video', 'tape', 'presumably', '3/4', 'inch', 'significantly', 'degraded', 'years', 'much', 'VHS', 'cassette', 'have', 'played', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'episodes', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'better', 'others', 'generally', 'speaking', 'will', 'get', 'blurry', 'pictures', 'fading', 'color', 'banding', 'streaking', 'video', 'noise', 'shifting', 'contrast', 'color', 'levels', 'same', 'episode', 'little', 'red', 'white', 'dots', 'various', 'corners', 'screen', 'frame', 'vertical', 'line', 'running', 'thru', 'picture', 'right', 'left', 'side', 'few', 'episodes', 'look', 'so', 'bad', 'even', 'worst', 'TV', 'Land', 'reception', 'will', 'look', 'better', 'Usually', 'closeups', 'are', 'pretty', 'clear', 'not', 'always.Basically', 'what', 'get', 'video', 'higher', 'resolution', 'look', 'old', 'broadcast', 'video', 'tape', 'much', 'time', 'not', 'pretty', 'sight', 'what', 'understand', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'releases', 'Season', '8', '9', 'look', 'far', 'sight', 'better', 'do', 'believe', 'Sony', 'had', 'bad', 'source', 'masters', 'did', 'very', 'poor', 'job', 'transferring', 'combination', 'two', 'things.Basically', 'LOVE', 'Family', 'will', 'soon', 'get', 'fact', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'look', 'best', 'will', 'look', 'would', 'be', 'play', 'DVD', 'old', 'standard', 'CRT', '4:3', 'standard', 'definition', 'set', 'problems', 'video', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'apparent', 'HDTV', 'will', 'see', 'have', 'mentioned', 'better', 'resolution', 'have', 'worse', 'DVD', 'are', 'going', 'look', 'personally', 'have', 'upconverted', '1080p', 'using', 'Oppo', 'BDP-93', 'wonders', 'DVD', 'case', 'just', ""n't"", 'help', 'are', 'VERY', 'FEW', 'episodes', 'here', 'there', 'almost', 'look', 'good', 'extent', 'it.As', 'sound', 'was', 'originally', 'recorded', 'mono', 'video', 'same', 'tape', 'sound', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'picture', 'Most', 'time', 'clear', 'enough', 'far', 'being', 'high', 'fidelity', 'recordings', 'were', 'only', 'marginal', 'begin', 'nothing', 'special', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'here', 'Basically', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'show', 'albeit', 'varying', 'degrees', 'quality.A', 'few', 'shows', 'have', 'very', 'bad', 'sound', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'Family', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'programs', 'owning', 'season', 'was', 'something', 'really', 'felt', 'needed', 'do', 'Unfortunately', 'quality', 'first', '6', 'Seasons', 'distributed', 'Sony', 'are', 'pretty', 'plus', 'side', 'get', 'shows', 'first', '6', 'years', 'unedited', 'commercial', 'free', 'everything', 'intact', 'such', 'end', 'came', 'last', 'commercial', 'credits', 'roll', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'long', 'being', 'chopped', 'off', 'editing', 'syndication', 'have', 'decided', 'pretty', 'much', 'bad', 'quality', 'video', 'just', 'enjoy', 'show', 'want', ""'All"", 'Family', 'uncut', 'chronological', 'order', 'only', 'choice', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'better', 'quality', 'video', 'recording', 'TV', 'Land', 'episodes', 'editing', 'out', 'commercials', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'entire', 'program', 'chop', 'good', '5', 'minutes', 'very', 'least', 'Bottom', 'line', 'love', 'Family', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'bought', 'eventually', 'are', 'expecting', 'great', 'even', 'good', 'quality', 'video', 'transfers', 'not', 'set', 'Remember', 'better', 'TV', 'worse', 'will', 'look.Even', 'problems', 'transfers', 'still', 'totally', 'recommend', 'series', 'SO', 'GOOD', 'show', 'lousy', 'transfers', 'such', 'still', 'give', 'selection', 'FIVE', 'STARS', 'would', 'give', 'transfer', 'packaging', 'only', '2', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A
