His parents found him on a boat and adopted him. Now he's 13 and going through some pretty big changes. Not only is he getting taller, voice getting deeper, and getting hormones, his hands are becoming sticky, getting electricaally charged, and his skin keeps growing scales! The class nerd tells him he's turning into a mer-man! He also tries to help him. When Cody's real mom appears (she's a mermaid), Cody must choose between a life on land, or the sea. Teaches kids about family and friends. Rent it today!",5,A Great Made For T.V.

My 4 & 5 year old girls loved the mermaid theme, or shall I say merman!  And, as usual, it provides some wonderful messages along with the great entertainment.  The boy quickly has to deal with the ever changing problems of his body, as he turns into the merman - as if being a teenager isn't complicated enough!!!  In addition, he is faced with his birth mother, who wants to spend some time with him... and at the same time he has the guilt of betraying his own adopted parents.  We won't even discuss the other teenage issues of girls, bullies, and more.  Disney takes a very complicated issue and add the ultimate complexity of the mermaid theme, and presents a highly entertaining and educational movie.

This one is about a couple who find a baby boy in a basket on a boat. They take him in and raise him. Now, Cody has become a teenager. Life is pretty tough with bullys, swimming practice, and his crush. But now he's hit with another  problem. He's a merman! He seeks help from the class nerd whos father plans to catch a mermaid. Once Cody meets his birth Mom, he has to decide weather he wants to stay on land, or live in the sea.

566132,A36N4UO9LQSQQL,B000053VF4,thunderstorm264,"[5, 9]","This movie is about a teenager named Cody Griffin (Chez Starbuck). He was left on a boat by his mermaid mom when he was a baby, and his adoptive parents found him. Now, when he turns 13, he starts getting some strange symptoms: always thirsty, sticky hands and feet, electric current coming from him, and scales on his hands when he gets wet. His friend Jess (Justin Jon Ross) tells him that he's a merman, but Cody doesn't believe it. He goes to the state swimming championship with his swim team (but sneaks out to do so) and breaks a state record, as well as giving his teammate Sean a full view of his secret. Meanwhile, he's also having trouble with his girlfriend Sam (Courtnee Draper) and getting more and more freaked out by this merman thing.This movie is not bad, but not good either. I got really sick of it pretty fast. It is definitely not worth [the money]! Who would pay that much for any movie? This movie has a great performance by Dave Coulier as the dad of Cody, and he evens manages to be funny. He was awesome. The other actors were great too. This movie deals with every adolescent issue I could thing of except drugs and alcohol, etc. You should see this for fun and a look at real teenage life (which doesn't include merpeople).",3,Not bad...but I got sick of it real fast,1030665600,"08 30, 2002",2002,1252,"['movie', 'teenager', 'named', 'Cody', 'Griffin', 'Chez', 'Starbuck', 'was', 'left', 'boat', 'mermaid', 'mom', 'when', 'was', 'baby', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'found', 'Now', 'when', '13', 'getting', 'strange', 'symptoms', 'always', 'thirsty', 'sticky', 'hands', 'feet', 'electric', 'current', 'coming', 'scales', 'hands', 'when', 'wet', 'friend', 'Jess', 'Justin', 'Jon', 'Ross', 'merman', 'Cody', ""n't"", 'believe', 'state', 'swimming', 'championship', 'swim', 'team', 'out', 'do', 'so', 'state', 'record', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'teammate', 'Sean', 'full', 'view', 'secret', 'Meanwhile', 'also', 'having', 'trouble', 'girlfriend', 'Sam', 'Courtnee', 'Draper', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'freaked', 'out', 'merman', 'thing.This', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'either', 'got', 'really', 'sick', 'pretty', 'fast', 'definitely', 'not', 'worth', '[', 'money', ']', 'Who', 'would', 'pay', 'much', 'movie', 'movie', 'great', 'performance', 'Dave', 'Coulier', 'dad', 'Cody', 'manages', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'awesome', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'great', 'too', 'movie', 'adolescent', 'issue', 'could', 'thing', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'etc', 'should', 'see', 'fun', 'look', 'real', 'teenage', 'life', ""n't"", 'include', 'merpeople']",The Thirteenth Year VHS
