When I see old WWII newsreels, the black and white pictures make it seem so distant, something in the past, almost unreal.  This documentary using all color film, makes all the difference in the world.  The color makes the events seem more real, more eerie when you see such monsters as Hitler or Tojo.  For that reason alone, the documentary hit home with a very resonating thud for me, and made this excellent documentetary that much more meaningful to me.

Sommer ""AJ in AZ""","[14, 41]","Interesting to see so much new footage (even if it isn't really in HD; it's just 16mm film processed in HD but the quality isn't HD). The 12 stories were compelling. But the footage did not match up with the stories! A character may be talking about seeing dead soldiers and they show pictures of dead soldiers but, really, they are just generic dead soldier pictures. They aren't what the story-teller actually saw. WTF kind of history is this? Well, it is The History Channel, isn't it? Where ""close is good enough."" Aircraft markings are wrong, division patches are wrong. Better to have skipped the stories orr done them with whatever real photos were available, and simply did another series to show the new footage with narration and no stories. Worse, there is no ""Big Picture"" to tell us how these stories fit into the whole war (many important events are not even mentioned because the personal stories did not intersect them). Folks who compare this favorable with ""The World at War"" really are deluded. Ken Burns' ""The War"" took the same approach and made it work beautifully. This is, well, the History Channel, which revels in ""recreations"" of events ands junks up everything it touches.

As key points and battles are described a better understanding of the why various topics became large issues to that generation that were not well described in general media or discussed by that generation if ever.  Perhaps they don't teach history in middle school, high school, or college anymore.  But watching this series really helps puts things into some perspective.  It is a shame that they waited so long to do this series as most of the key WWII leaders military and civilian had passed on as well as those who may have had an unusually greater perspective of what was happening as it was happening due to their roles such as the famous news reporters of that era.

It's like an ADHD version of a WW2 history. There is a lot of great footage presented here, but it feels like the production team wanted to use everything they had so they threw it all together without much thought. The voice over actors are unnecessary especially when the real persons are alive and speaking for themselves. It becomes incredibly annoying when they go back and forth mixing the actor's voice with the real person's. And then there is the music score which is overdramatic and unnecessarily used. It sounds like a stock score for a Hollywood disaster B movie. I wasn't expecting much from this series for two reasons, it's from the History Channel, whose productions are usually very pedestrian and cater to people who need theatrics to get them interested in historical events, and secondly the title is nothing more than an obvious PR grab at the current hysteria over high definition audio/video.This series wishes it could be Ken Burns' The War or even The World at War, which are the two definitive presentations of WW2.

The quality is sometimes good, but more often it's no better, and sometimes worse than a regular, standard definition DVD about WW II. When I dipped into the 2, very brief extras, it quickly became evident why the quality was so low. While the producers scoured the planet for footage, what they did was simply project the prints through a regular projector and then film that image with a RED digital camera. Now, while the RED camera has extraordinary capabilities, it can only shoot what's put in front of it. In this case, what that means is that the quality of the image is dependent on the quality of the mechanical projectors through which the image came. If we're talking about old, old 8mm film blown through a Bell & Howell projector, you are not going to get quality. It's a great pity that, having come up with all this unique footage, the producers couldn't find the money to do the job properly, and SCAN the image into a computer, frame by frame, at 4K resolution. They even manage to show us some footage (the civilian suicides on Okinawa) which I have seen in PBS documentaries looking much sharper, and properly coloured. In this set of shows, that footage is not only scratchy and blurred, it's also totally purple, because no colour correction was applied to the image.Bottom line: it's not HD. It's an HD picture of a very low tech image, with very little done in the way of cleanup or rebalancing of the colours. Some of the footage is also colourized black and white, and not original colour, so that's another claim (it's on the box) that isn't quite true. Some of the footage is unique, and worth seeing. But the Pacific war in particular was shot in colour from the word go, and in 35mm, if we judge by the images they show us of combat cameramen. Those films are still, so far as I know, in the national archives, and if they are archivally scanned they will yield significant detail, and much much more than we see in this set of shows.If you can get it at less than $20, the intrinsic interest of some of the footage is worth it.

The real-life soldiers/sailors/marines are terrific and their story is worthy of being told.The production suffers from two main problems, that pull it down from being the best of class in the area of color WWII documentaries.1) There is heavy use of colorized film.  For example, you can now watch General MacArthur wade ashore in a film you've seen before, but now it's in color.  I found that to be too distracting to abide.  There are many, many other cases of film colorization, this is just the most shocking.2) There is a lot of unnecessary back and forth... from Leyte to Europe, then back to Leyte, then back to Europe, then back to Leyte, then to somewhere else in Europe, then back to Leyte...  At each transition, there is a high-tech, google-earth-like movement across the globe that I found out of place and amateurish given the seriousness of the subject.I found ""World War II - The Lost Color Archives"", sold right here at Amazon.com (World War II - The Lost Color Archives), to be a much more satisfying experience.

1285990,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B002RUNMMO,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[4, 4]","I'm not normally an avid watcher of WW II documentaries, and thought as many others did that the final and definitive word has been spoken on the subject, in the BBC World at War seriesThe World at War [Blu-ray].  However, this series adds a new scope and dimension to remembering the Second World War.  The combination of the approach to the material, and the material itself, has produced something incredibly memorable, sobering, informative, and essential viewing.  The material is colour footage, mostly unseen until now, found, as the series prologue says, over a two year search.  This has been photographed with High definition, to preserve the material.  So what you are saying is high definition  version of material of various quality - 8mm, 16mm, often blemished with the ravages of time.  Seeing this material, which mostly reflects the Pacific campaign, though North Africa and Europe are well represented, is extraordinary.  The distance emotionally and time-wise from the events that you have when seeing them in black and white, is not so easy when presented with the stark reality in colour.  It makes the moments more vivid, and more human.. which brings us to how they have handled this material.  Rather than try and tell the story of the war from a broad overview of tactics etc - we see the events through 12 different peoples first hand perspective.  This is war, as seen through the eyes of individuals, not the historians's traditional dispassionate approach.  If there is a down side, it is that this is a very America-centric view of the war, starting from Pearl Harbour and concluding with VJ Day.  But that is a reflection of the materials available, and is not an indictment of the filmmakers.Combined with a sober and well scripted commentary read by Gary Sinise, and voiced by contemporary actors, interspersed with interviews with those still alive, makes this something quite unique, a moving and educational experience.

1285993,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B002RUNMMO,O Shepard,"[1, 2]","'Word War II in HD' is a noteworthy attempt to chronicle the Second World War. With excellent narration by Gary Sinese, and additional narrative by some of the 12 surviving veterans and their voice actor substitutes, 'WWII in HD' is probably the best series ever produced by the History Channel. Unfortunately, that isn't saying very much. Although I appreciate the effort made by the producers and the work made to find this footage, this is still a typical History Channel production orientated more towards entertaining than documenting.  Ken Burns 'War' or the BBC's  'World at War' it is not. Nor is it better than several docudramas made over the past years such as 'Band of Brothers' and 'The Pacific'. 'World War II in HD' stands in the middle of the pack of available WW II documentaries. The series at the least deserves kudos for the attempt of producing something new, and if any fault is to made, the discredit must squarely be given to the History Channel for so obviously restricting this production to its own set of documentary rules. I rated this series 3 stars for the valiant attempt at chronicling WW II, but DVD packaging faults necessarily reducing my real score to 2 1/2 stars.Much is made about this series made in HD. Not true. All it really means is that the found footage had been transferred and cleaned up by computer for digital restoration and editing. Do not be disappointed that the footage is not really HD however. HD did not exist in the 1940's and the editors did a good job making the existing footage presentable for modern television screens.Much is also made that the producers spend 2 years searching for color footage never before seen on TV. No big deal here either. Most of what was not generally seen before is archived footage and home movies. The series makes great use of color footage, colorized footage (despite the Amazon note in the description, colorized film is used a lot), tinted black&white;, and standard black&white.; Most of the color footage is from the American war in the Pacific. This should be no surprise to anybody because it was primarily Navy and Marine combat photographers in the Pacific who used color during WW II. Color footage in Europe was rare and mostly taken during the last weeks of the war in Germany and Eastern Europe.The History Channel is well know for producing lightweight history filled with over-dramatization, simplification of events, and repetition of material. Luckily, except for over-dramatization, 'World War II in HD' is an exception. The series is a decent production that truly shines in several of the 10 episodes. One wonders what could have been achieved if the producers had been given an adequate budget and plenty of time to pull it all together. But that is not how the History Channel operates. The History Channel is an entertainment channel. It is not a video documentary producer as is PBS or the BBC. 'World War II in HD' reflect this by being overly dramatic. Video clips used for the narration are obviously selected and edited for dramatic effect. Some clips do not fit at all. Added sound effects are plentiful (sound was rarely recorded in combat footage) and the music sound track often overwhelms the source material. Still, the compelling nature of the script often shines through the hype.The series follows the course of the war from an American perspective, a fact not indicated anywhere in the production copy. No mention is made of the Eastern European theatre nor that of Southeast Asia. In fact any theatre of war that seems to have had limited American filming is given short rift. There is little on North Africa for example. It would have been nice to indicate somewhere in this series how 'worldwide' this world war really was. There is plenty of German, Russian, and British footage available, especially in color, that could have been used.The series is basically bookmarked by the stories of 12 veterans of WW II. Some of the vets are given more exposure than others. The story of the war is told through the eyes of the vets via narration by some of the still living vets or by an actor's spoken words that I presume to be the written words of some of them (some of the vets were journalists). It is here that the series truly shines. Not up to Ken Burn standards, but a good attempt anyway, marred by spending not enough time with these still living survivors.And lastly, The series set is cheaply produced which is why I downgrade this series to 2 1/2 stars. The set does not contain a printed information sheet. There is no list of episodes anywhere in the package. The bonus extras add nothing to understanding the production. Bonuses include 2 three minute videos that basically states that the footage was transferred to computer for digital cleanup and outtakes of 6 of the living veterans.There is no 'Making of ...' video.The DVD set  does not have captions for the hearing impaired, alternate language selections, or episode scene indexing. This set is very bare bones.In summary, this is a minor league edutainment set that is somewhat interesting and worth the asking price because it so low. If, however, you are interested in great video WW II history, buyers would be better served by DVD sets from the BBC, PBS, and other producers.This review is for the standard DVD set.

And it's true.Seventy-years in the making, culled from over 3,000 hours of footage - some of it newly discovered with narration from secret diaries.  This view of WWII from both sides is personal and detailed in a way I have never seen.Originally broadcast on the History channel, this extraordinary ten-episode documentary (almost eight hours!) is nothing less than astonishing.  The majority of the footage is in color, high quality and not widely, if ever, broadcast.This compelling, sprawling, film is the best account of WWII I have seen.  It does not flinch from the carnage of battle or the aftermath of combat.  I was shocked at the sight of Japanese civilians, after the battle of Saipan, throwing themselves off cliffs to avoid capture by American soldiers.The time covered here begins with the period when Hitler was conquering his neighbors relatively unopposed and America seemed oblivious.  Then Pearl Harbor explodes and we're at war with the ""Japs"" in the Pacific.  We vividly experience the fighting at Guadalcanal, Tarawa, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and bloody Iwo Jima.  We ride with the Germans in Europe and North Africa -- the invasion of Tunisia, D-day, the Battle of the Bulge.  The victory in Europe is brought to life as is the emotional release of the Japanese surrender after devastating bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.What I liked most about WWII in HD is that these events are viewed through personal experiences.  There's war correspondents; an Austrian immigrant who escaped the Nazis and enlisted in the U.S. Army; a nurse with General George Patton's Third Army; an African-American pilot; a Japanese-American medic who served heroically while his family was in an internment camp; and others, all voiced by actors like Rob Lowe, Amy Smart, LL Cool J and Steve Zahn.  Gary Sinise provides the effective narration with a detached even tone.When experienced as a whole, this beautifully edited, powerful, dramatic epic works on the same level as a great novel.  Great care has been given to the most potent juxtaposition of words, images and music.  There are on-camera interviews with survivors who recall the horrific sacrifices that liberty apparently requires.

I think that we need to protect every bit of film, every photograph that preserves the memory of not only the great heroes of the greatest war ever, but the horror of what war is, so that we never, ever embark upon such a path again without first trying our damndest to find another way. This series shows color footage culled from hidden archives and personal  collections, linked by the stories of various individuals who participated in some way or another - an infantryman, a pilot and author, a nurse, a Tuskegee airman, a Nisei, and more. Actors provide a surprisingly competent performance - giving voice to the thoughts and words  of  people who are long gone.  Survivors are also interviewed, and it is clear that the memories of those events remain as clear now as they were sixty years ago. Some of the images are disturbingly graphic, so I do advise caution with watching with smaller children. The quality of some of the footage is rather poor, so don't be disappointed if the images are not crystal clear like the promised HD. Some of the sections were not particularly strong - the part profiling the Tuskegee Airman seemed rather thin - but I assume that there was a paucity of good footage, so I didn't really consider this to be that great a weakness.  Very significant battles were entirely skipped over, but I think that it was beyond the scope of this project to completely summarize the entire war, nor do I think it necessary.

1286019,AUSFBVEVSUMBW,B002RUNMMO,Wade H. Rice Jr.,"[4, 4]","There's not much I can add to the numerous comments, both positive and negative about the series.  The important thing is the producers realized that what color footage existed of World War II needed to be located soon and archived in high definition media for future generations to see what one of history's tragedies looked like as close to true life as possible, before it too, became lost to eternity, along with the experiences (and lives) of some of the veterans who fought in this war.  The wonderful thing about this series is we now have the recollections of an additional dozen veterans (about half of them still alive) along with those who contributed to earlier WWII television series, such as the British ""The World at War"" and the PBS Network/Ken Burns' ""The War"".I think that this series could probably have benefited from a better name than the one given it.  Simply calling it ""WWII in HD"" doesn't give the series the full scope of the justice it received.  Probably something like ""WWII as Experienced by Those Who Fought in It"" would be better, but that still doesn't quite hit the nail on the head.  This series probably goes the furthest of any to document poignantly and as realistically as possible, the experiences of those who were in combat first hand.  It dwells on the horrors of war, and doesn't have a political or sociological axe to grind as Ken Burns did in his series.  The concluding few minutes of the last episode of the series makes this clear; that WWII was a tragedy for the entire human race, regardless of one's ethnicity or nationality.  The concluding comments about WWII in general as made by Tuskegee airman Shelby Westbrook could not have been better put.This series presupposes some prior knowledge of WWII, and for those who know little about WWII, ""WWII in HD"" is not the best place to start.  The best place to start is probably the British series, ""The World at War"", providing a good video overview, and is universally recognized as the reference in the visual medium.  Other than that, there are innumerable books and multi-volume encyclopedic series on WWII, too numerous to mention here.  Ken Burns' ""The War"" can be viewed as a companion series to ""WWII in HD"".WWII in HD [Blu-ray]",5,A Great Series; Deserves a Better Name,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,2238,"['not', 'much', 'can', 'add', 'numerous', 'comments', 'positive', 'negative', 'series', 'important', 'thing', 'producers', 'realized', 'what', 'color', 'footage', 'existed', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'needed', 'be', 'located', 'soon', 'archived', 'high', 'definition', 'media', 'future', 'generations', 'see', 'what', 'one', 'history', 'tragedies', 'looked', 'close', 'true', 'life', 'possible', 'too', 'became', 'lost', 'eternity', 'experiences', 'veterans', 'who', 'fought', 'war', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'series', 'now', 'have', 'recollections', 'additional', 'dozen', 'veterans', 'half', 'still', 'alive', 'who', 'contributed', 'earlier', 'WWII', 'television', 'series', 'such', 'British', 'World', 'War', 'PBS', 'Network/Ken', 'Burns', 'War', '.I', 'think', 'series', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'benefited', 'better', 'name', 'one', 'given', 'Simply', 'calling', 'WWII', 'HD', ""n't"", 'give', 'series', 'full', 'scope', 'justice', 'received', 'Probably', 'something', 'WWII', 'Experienced', 'Who', 'Fought', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'still', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'series', 'probably', 'furthest', 'document', 'poignantly', 'as', 'realistically', 'possible', 'experiences', 'who', 'were', 'combat', 'first', 'hand', 'horrors', 'war', ""n't"", 'have', 'political', 'sociological', 'axe', 'grind', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'did', 'series', 'concluding', 'few', 'minutes', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'clear', 'WWII', 'was', 'tragedy', 'entire', 'human', 'race', 'regardless', 'one', 'ethnicity', 'nationality', 'concluding', 'comments', 'WWII', 'general', 'made', 'Tuskegee', 'airman', 'Shelby', 'Westbrook', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'put.This', 'series', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'WWII', 'who', 'know', 'little', 'WWII', 'WWII', 'HD', 'not', 'best', 'place', 'start', 'best', 'place', 'start', 'probably', 'British', 'series', 'World', 'War', 'providing', 'good', 'video', 'overview', 'universally', 'recognized', 'reference', 'visual', 'medium', 'Other', 'are', 'innumerable', 'books', 'multi-volume', 'encyclopedic', 'series', 'WWII', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'here', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'War', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'companion', 'series', 'WWII', 'HD', '.WWII', 'HD', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",WWII in HD

My dad installed the telephones on some of those Pacific raids, and he rarely spoke about what he did or what he saw.  I did not find out till shortly before he died in 2000 that he'd survived a Kamikaze raid.The stories and footage show ghastly carnage, and the numbers are staggering... more soldiers and sailors and marines landed at Normandy that are in the entire US military today - and that was ONE LANDING.  The series begs for comparison with The War by Ken Burns.  It is vital to watch both.  The Burns series gives a bit better sequential ordering, while this series shows the film they found, which was concentrated in certain areas and probably lacking in others.  The more I learn about this period, the more I want to know, including the lead-up, the views of the other players [the British, the French, the Russians, the Italians, the Germans, the Japanese, and the minor players, ranging from the Pacific Islanders to the smaller nations of Eastern Europe.
