It begins well enough and looks as if it might have some humor, then veers off into two less-than-appealing characters who we are told are grandfather and grandson.  We would never guess it otherwise.The grandfather's behavior at first is just plain mean.  The grandson's is childish.  His behavior in the wilderness verges on ridiculous.  Okay, he's a city boy, but he's not stupid, nor hopelessly paranoid.  Neither is really a character.  Nor is there really a story.This is an urbanite's Romantic dream of what life in the woods is like, complete with Rousseau's noble savages.  The movie is preachy, but worse, the ideas preached are hopelessly vague, a mixture of common sense, Eastern mysticism and Indian lore.The changes in the relationship move in fits and starts without adequate cause.  There is also a totally unmotivated love interest.  And the big change at the end will leave you shaking your head in wonder.One wonders again: Who writes these things?  And how did they get someone to put up several million dollars for this?  I am sure there are better books out there than this.  Why aren't they chosen for filming?Suit yourself.

A family thinks that an estranged father/grandfather is wasting his fortune, and thereby the family's. The grandson, an attorney, is dispatched to serve papers giving the family Power of Attorney so that they can protect themselves from his elderly whims.This movie makes its own way by creating tension in ways we don't often see in Hallmark movies. The writers did a good job of presenting provocative bits of wisdom without being preachy and self-assured. The grandfather (Ed Asner), dispenser of the wisdom, is humanly flawed. The grandson's role comes through as much more than the shallow caricature it could have been. He is annoyed at his grandfather's odd ways but deals with him as difficult family rather than an opponent to be defeated.The relationship is built slowly but at a well designed pace that leaves the viewer rooting for both men.

953540,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B000BYY0TC,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 5]","This movie looked great from the cover and short description on the back.  But honestly, it was not that good.  They had the potential to do so much with the storyline and idea, but instead it was cheesy and unimaginative.Matt Fleming is a lawyer from a rich family.  He has a pretty girlfriend, and the high life, but he's just not very happy.  When his mother asks him to go visit his grandpa before all their inheritance is spent, he doesn't think much of it and travels out there.  But Grandpa has a few other ideas.  He disables Matt's car and locks the papers inside, then he shuts himself in his cabin (he just bought a property with 200+ acres and will be buying more land).  Matt has to spend the night outside on the porch.  For this city boy it is not a good way to go, he hates the outdoors and seemingly everything with it and definitely is not overly pleased with his grandfather.  But after awhile, and a certain girl that delivers groceries, he may be able to change his mind.Characters:Edward Asner-Jack Green (Grandpa)Jason London-Matt FlemingGwen-Missy CriderThere are other characters but they don't play as large a role as these three.  Honestly, all of these characters were very unbelievable.  They were too much in one direction or the other and just didn't seem like real people.  I was hoping that Matt would be killed off rather quickly he was so annoying and idiotic.  I mean honestly, the guy acts like a raspberry isn't something he's ever encountered before and even being a city boy that's largely ridiculous.  The other characters had these same things that made them feel like they were just there to fill a role instead of being normal.The whole plot felt rushed.  There was too dramatic of a change for Matt too fast and no real reasons are given for any of the motivations in this movie.  It just felt contrived and forced.  I did like that it was about family and returning to things simpler, it just wasn't executed very well.  That being said, there was nothing inappropriate with this movie and it would be fine to watch as a family movie.  I wish I would have enjoyed it more, but it just wasn't going to work for me I guess.  More character development and less rush might have made this movie worth watching.Review by M.

Ed Asner is a great actor whom I have enjoyed for many years, as well as Mel Harris being in the line-up, (who was in it for a grand total of 2 scenes). The scenery was beautiful and it started out looking like it would have a good ""moral lesson"" involving the materialism of today verses the simple life involving hard work and depth of character, but it missed the boat in my opinion. The Dove Foundation Family Approved award is a little odd to me, using their own words ""Our standards and criteria are based on Judeo/Christian values"" in yet many religious symbol were shown very pointedly in this movie, with the final  summary stating something similar to ""If you go to the Spirit Father and he is pleased with you, He may make you young again"". The writing is confusing also, as the mother (Mel Harris) sends her son to get a signature on the land from the grandfather (Ed Asner) basically giving her Power of Attorney, because she thought he was crazy to be living in the woods ~ but in the end when things change, involving her son basically doing the same thing, doesn't seem upset in the least. Bottomline, this show is not written in a ""believable"" manner, and although they were attempting to have a positive message in a materialistic world, I do not think this movie will give many people pause to think.

Ed Asner of Mary Tyler Moore fame played a grandpa dying of cancer. His grandson is to try to get him to sign papers so his mother could have the old man's property and put the old man away. As the film unfolds you learn quite a few lessons in love and understanding. It's really good. I loved it and the price was a good one.,5,Out of the Woods-movie,1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,386,"['was', 'rally', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'meaning', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'fame', 'played', 'grandpa', 'dying', 'cancer', 'grandson', 'try', 'get', 'sign', 'papers', 'mother', 'could', 'have', 'old', 'man', 'property', 'put', 'old', 'man', 'away', 'film', 'learn', 'quite', 'few', 'lessons', 'love', 'understanding', 'really', 'good', 'loved', 'price', 'was', 'good', 'one']",Out of the Woods

Not surprisingly, Matt is in for quite a culture shock. Not only does Jack do without any modern conveniences, but he also enjoys wandering in the great outdoors completely naked. Even worse -- at least as far as Matt is concerned -- Jack has spent the entire family fortune on a patch of land that he intends to donate to a local Native American child. In trying to curb Jack's enthusiasm and control the old man's behavior, Matt instead ends up learning about how to fend for himself in the wilderness, a skill that comes in very handy during a serious mid-film crisis. Matt also applies what he has learned from Jack in his efforts to make a lasting commitment to his own girlfriend Linda (Meredith Salenger).
