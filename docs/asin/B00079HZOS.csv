I remember seeing the previews for it 3 years ago but due to a hectic schedule did not see it in the theaters.  I wish I had.The idea behind and the feel of the story reminds me of some of the works of Philip K. Dick.  (In the works I've read the ideas of time and reality as well as the use of paranoia have been prominent.)  The writer/director is successful in creating not on a very interesting primary character (stunningly played by Robin Williams) but a rich culture surrounding that character.  That culture has issues that affect that world as issues such as stem cell research affect ours today.In the extras the movie makers spoke of the production design as something they wanted to be warm, not cold and futuristic.  However, I felt a coldness ... centered around Williams's character.  His outward sterility was captivating.Had I been able to I would have given this movie 9.5 stars for there were 2 elements that detracted from my enjoyment of the movie.1.  The music was, in my opinion, overbearing.  I thought it could have been more subtle and given itself plenty of room to grow.2.  James Caviezel's beard was awful.  I just wanted to rip it off his face.  Even some cheesy '80's Miami Vice stubble would have been better.Still, a wonderful movie that kept my attention and my interest throughout.",5,Unsung,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,1360,"['was', 'wonderfully', 'surprised', 'movie', 'remember', 'seeing', 'previews', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'due', 'hectic', 'schedule', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'theaters', 'wish', 'had.The', 'idea', 'behind', 'feel', 'story', 'works', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'works', ""'ve"", 'read', 'ideas', 'time', 'reality', 'as', 'well', 'use', 'paranoia', 'have', 'been', 'prominent', 'writer/director', 'successful', 'creating', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'primary', 'character', 'stunningly', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'rich', 'culture', 'surrounding', 'character', 'culture', 'issues', 'affect', 'world', 'issues', 'such', 'stem', 'cell', 'research', 'affect', 'today.In', 'extras', 'movie', 'makers', 'spoke', 'production', 'design', 'something', 'wanted', 'be', 'warm', 'not', 'cold', 'futuristic', 'However', 'felt', 'coldness', 'centered', 'Williams', 'character', 'outward', 'sterility', 'was', 'captivating.Had', 'been', 'able', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '9.5', 'stars', 'were', '2', 'elements', 'detracted', 'enjoyment', 'movie.1', 'music', 'was', 'opinion', 'overbearing', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'subtle', 'given', 'plenty', 'room', 'grow.2', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'beard', 'was', 'awful', 'just', 'wanted', 'rip', 'off', 'face', 'Even', 'cheesy', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'stubble', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better.Still', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'kept', 'attention', 'interest']",The Final Cut

Turns out science fiction is not really about monsters coming down in space ships or machines that rule the world. It's about what technology does when we don't think about all the implications before we implement it.Robin Williams plays Alan Hakman, a cutter. Like with movies, he edits the footage down to just the best parts. The edited recording is then played at the person's memorial service, and apparently also implanted in their tombstone.The difference is, these are recordings made through an individual's eyes when they have an EYE implant that makes a record of everything they see and hear all their lives. Not everyone has an implant, because they are expensive. But they are implanted prenatally, so as to provide a baby's eye view of his own birth.Now think about this: everything you do, everything you see and hear, is recorded. And parents typically do not tell their children that they have an implant until they are at least 21. So all those childhood memories are recorded accurately (well, sort of; some people's dreams also get recorded), good and bad.For what should be obvious reasons, the cutter needs to be a compassionate person, someone who can see and forget the bad things; forgive sins, in effect, in the sense of cutting them out of the final recording. There is also an iron-clad rule that a cutter cannot himself have an implant, because it would then be recording everything he saw when he worked. All the sins he cut out.There's also a protest group that is demonstrating against the implants, and in fact have created tattoos which create interference so the recordings are scrambled and useless. Some have their faces elaborately tattooed, as a protest against their parents having given them an implant.Now Alan has the cutting job on one of the executives of the EYE Corporation, and this is the first time one of their insiders' recordings have been released to the widow. She had to go to court to get it. Clearly, they do not want the closed-door meetings of the corporation opened to the view of a cutter.Things get really weird when Alan realizes he has an implant. He didn't know because his parents died together in an accident when he was 12, so long before they got around to telling him.OK, I won't spoil it any worse than I have already. This is the most serious role I have seen Robin Williams do, and he has done a brilliant job.",4,Robin Williams Gets Serious -- Deadly Serious,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2409,"['Incredibly', 'weird', 'movie', 'out', 'science', 'fiction', 'not', 'really', 'monsters', 'coming', 'down', 'space', 'ships', 'machines', 'rule', 'world', 'what', 'technology', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'implications', 'implement', 'it.Robin', 'Williams', 'Alan', 'Hakman', 'cutter', 'movies', 'footage', 'down', 'just', 'best', 'parts', 'edited', 'recording', 'then', 'played', 'person', 'memorial', 'service', 'apparently', 'also', 'implanted', 'tombstone.The', 'difference', 'are', 'recordings', 'made', 'individual', 'eyes', 'when', 'have', 'EYE', 'implant', 'record', 'everything', 'see', 'hear', 'lives', 'Not', 'everyone', 'implant', 'are', 'expensive', 'are', 'implanted', 'prenatally', 'so', 'provide', 'baby', 'eye', 'view', 'own', 'birth.Now', 'think', 'everything', 'do', 'everything', 'see', 'hear', 'recorded', 'parents', 'typically', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'children', 'have', 'implant', 'are', 'least', '21', 'So', 'childhood', 'memories', 'are', 'recorded', 'accurately', 'well', 'sort', 'people', 'dreams', 'also', 'get', 'recorded', 'good', 'bad.For', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'cutter', 'be', 'compassionate', 'person', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'forget', 'bad', 'things', 'forgive', 'sins', 'effect', 'sense', 'cutting', 'final', 'recording', 'also', 'iron-clad', 'rule', 'cutter', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'implant', 'would', 'then', 'be', 'recording', 'everything', 'saw', 'when', 'worked', 'sins', 'cut', 'also', 'protest', 'group', 'demonstrating', 'implants', 'fact', 'have', 'created', 'tattoos', 'create', 'interference', 'recordings', 'are', 'scrambled', 'useless', 'have', 'elaborately', 'tattooed', 'protest', 'parents', 'having', 'given', 'implant.Now', 'Alan', 'cutting', 'job', 'one', 'executives', 'EYE', 'Corporation', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'insiders', 'recordings', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'widow', 'had', 'go', 'court', 'get', 'Clearly', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'closed-door', 'meetings', 'corporation', 'opened', 'view', 'cutter.Things', 'get', 'really', 'weird', 'when', 'Alan', 'implant', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'parents', 'died', 'together', 'accident', 'when', 'was', '12', 'so', 'long', 'got', 'around', 'telling', 'him.OK', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'worse', 'have', 'already', 'most', 'serious', 'role', 'have', 'seen', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'do', 'done', 'brilliant', 'job']",The Final Cut

Gotta kick the filmmakers simply for this.So the two big actors are the only strength of the movie. The futuristic plot had great potentials but, alas, the greatness was kinda ruined by poor execution of the story. I couldn't help feeling like the movie dragged on and on without anything really exciting happening. It seems like all Williams did was watching his computer screen and felt sorry for himself. The ""sin eater"" theme was supposed to be the key to our understanding of his character but it didn't come out quite right either. What else, the story seemed to imply that the whole thing took place in the future but really other than the eyetech chip, I could hardly see or feel any futuristic elements there. **sigh**More than that, the movie underused Caviezel and as a result he was actually not making any difference in the movie [could have used any mediocre actor in his place]. And the supposed romance in the story sucked big time, with no character development or background history whatsoever. The movie is also supposed to leave you with some kinda political and philosophical message but all I felt at the end of the movie was a relief that it was over. LOLWhat's more.. script was bad and so was editting.I'm not sure who made this movie but it sure looked like the work of a novice.I'm giving it three stars and not lower because of the actors and a futuristic plot [even if it didn't turn out right].",3,I expected better from a film with Williams/ Caviezel in it,1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,1548,"['movie', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'so', 'so', 'movie', 'Got', 'ta', 'kick', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'this.So', 'two', 'big', 'actors', 'are', 'only', 'strength', 'movie', 'futuristic', 'plot', 'had', 'great', 'potentials', 'alas', 'greatness', 'was', 'kinda', 'ruined', 'poor', 'execution', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'movie', 'dragged', 'anything', 'really', 'exciting', 'happening', 'Williams', 'did', 'was', 'watching', 'computer', 'screen', 'felt', 'sorry', 'sin', 'eater', 'theme', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'key', 'understanding', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'quite', 'right', 'either', 'What', 'else', 'story', 'seemed', 'imply', 'whole', 'thing', 'took', 'place', 'future', 'really', 'other', 'eyetech', 'chip', 'could', 'hardly', 'see', 'feel', 'futuristic', 'elements', 'there', '**sigh**More', 'movie', 'underused', 'Caviezel', 'result', 'was', 'actually', 'not', 'making', 'difference', 'movie', '[', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'mediocre', 'actor', 'place', ']', 'supposed', 'romance', 'story', 'sucked', 'big', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'background', 'history', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'also', 'supposed', 'leave', 'kinda', 'political', 'philosophical', 'message', 'felt', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'relief', 'was', 'over', 'LOLWhat', 'more..', 'script', 'was', 'bad', 'so', 'was', 'editting.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'sure', 'looked', 'work', 'novice.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'not', 'lower', 'actors', 'futuristic', 'plot', '[', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'right', ']']",The Final Cut

First, you have to have good actors doing good acting. Second, you need a viable plot with suspense (or comedy). And third, you need either a fresh idea or a new take on an old one.Where this movie succeeded was in the third category. The idea is very fresh: a new business centered around recording the entire life of an individual by inserting a chip into the brain of a fetus and then removing it many years later when the person dies; then a ""mind mortician"" (Robin Williams) sorts through all of your memories and pulls them up on a computer screen where he/she decides what to show at your wake and what not to (I mean, you wouldn't want them to show the time you stole something, or the first time you masturbated, would you?)This concept drew me into the film and held my attention quite well. But it failed miserably in the other two categories ...The actors were well-known, but the scenes were often rushed (for instance, when Robin Williams' character asks the wife of a famous man who died recently if she remembered a man her husband knew who wore thick glasses, she immediatedly responds, ""Why would you ask me about people other than family?"" A bit rushed and forced.)The plot. What was it? I'm not exactly sure what the writers/producers were trying to get across to us. I know that they wanted us to see the dangers in limiting our view only to an individuals ""good"" moments, and that technology can wreak havoc on this, but what was the plot? You know, the goal of the film?I've read other reviews that say Robin Williams' character was wooden/boring. No. I disagree. He's a ""mind mortician"". He sees the horrible things that we all do and keep hidden in the recesses of our minds. He's a dark man with darker secrets that he has to keep inside himself forever (he even refers to himself as a ""sin eater""), so his character needed to reflect that, and I feel he did.

But Williams has also demonstrated his ability to act in more serious roles too, like his portrayal of a man who works in the field of high tech in this movie, ""The Final Cut"".Williams' character in this movie has an unusual occupation: He is a ""cutter""- a person responsible for editing out selected parts of a person's life story from a full- length recording of his/her life. This task is performed at the time of a person's death and the resulting film is shown at a ""rememory"" celebration, which is a new way to remember past friends and relatives and is meant to take the place of a funeral.Williams' character is a troubled soul in this movie and he is forced to deal with all sorts of issues as he performs his job. Protestors are one of his many menaces. As you might guess, some members of the general public strongly object to editing a person's memory. This movie makes you think about technological advancement and the possibility of it being taken too far- to the point where questionable ethics and decision making become the norm in society.As much as I like the premise of this movie and agree that it makes a strong basis for a great film, I am a little disappointed with this film as a whole. The main problem I have with it is that it doesn't cross- examine the subject matter very deeply. Here you have a guy who can change a person's life story if he wishes. You have people protesting his actions and wishing he and others like him were dead. But there is no real analysis of the subject and its moral and ethical implications. No one really talks about the pros and cons to society or anything else. The movie runs its course without really saying or telling you very much at all, making it a forgettable motion picture.Robin Williams is ok in this role, but I didn't care much for his character. He is basically a wimp who doesn't stand up for himself in any way. The other performers in this movie are only average, but the reason for their collective mediocrity has more to do with weak writing and sub par direction than lack of talent.Overall, this movie is a grave disappointment. The premise behind the movie is excellent and it could have been made into a five- star motion picture with a solid script and some sound directing.

Interesting concept. Robin Williams plays Alan Hakman, a cutter. He looks at peoples lifes recordings and cuts them to a memory to be played at a wake for the dead person. He cuts out those scenes that wouldn't be appropriate for others to see. Only one problem, he has a recurring memory of his childhood that haunts him. He believes he somehow was responsible for a child dieing and feels guilty from the knowledge.When he has to cut an EYE implant recording for a widow whose husband was high in the corporation, he gets more than he bargained for. A group that wants the recordings to end will stop at nothing to get the recording Alan is cutting. While cutting the recording he finds a dark side to the person, but a party he was at reveals someone that has haunted Alan all his life. How is that possible and can he stay alive long enough to find out?

THIS IS  NOT a boring movie, but it is slow paced, methodical, and has a definite Indy or artsy-film feel to it.The acting is perfect.  Robin Williams plays a haunted and almost childish 51 year old adult who carries so much guilt and baggage from a childhood incident that he is almost crippled.  We all know Williams and how he can be a relentless comedian who can't seem to express himself enough, but in this movie he is deeply reserved and skillfully introverted.  The rest of the cast are mostly nobodies, but ever single one of them nails their performance - which means the director Omar Naim knows how to direct.The story is set in the future but gratefully spares us all of the sci-fi gadgets, cars, widgets and toys so common in futurist movies.  Their world is exactly like ours with one exception: our entire lives can be recorded.

Caviezel is underused and not fleshed out (a failing that strikes all of the other characters, as well - all of them).

And like that movie, Robin plays a flawed character with a past event that informs his entire life. He is a cutter, ie someone who reviews a person's memories accumulated over a lifetime and stored in an inplant device and then makes a final movie of that person's life to be viewed by family and loved ones at the funeral. He sees everything, the dirt, the nastyness, but his job is to portray the person in a good light which he does exceedingly well. Williams character is the best in the business, but he holds onto a dark secret from his own past that makes him the man he is and that secret haunts him. The ending may disappoint some people, I however enjoyed it and thought the film wrapped up in if not an entirely satisfying way, in an artistically logical one. The Final Cut is science fiction for grownups, i.e. no explosions, alien invasions or endless and mindless action. This is a thinking movie about the foibles of the human condition, not an action packed space opera. Those that like some speculation with their science fiction should enjoy this film.

This is movie full of what ifs and one great performance by Robin Williams.The premise is simple, Zoe implants record all of the things a person sees and hears in his life.  After death, the family hires a Cutter to create a short film of memories summarizing that person's life.  The film is about the best Cutter, Alan Hakman, played by Robin Williams.  What makes him special is his ability to take some of the nastiest people, with some of the nastiest experiences and criminal acts and sanitize their lives so that their Rememory Ceremony is beautiful and expected.  As he says, he's working for the living, not for the dead.The Sci-Fi premise brings so many possibilities and issues that the film, while comprehensive, picks only a couple to concentrate on.  It's a human story, so what we find is that Alan has his own horrible secret, his own terrible memory, and sanitizing other people's is a sort of therapy for him.  But he must come to terms with this memory when he finds clues in record he's currently editing.While reminiscent of themes in Strange Days, Final Cut has the feel of a Philip Dick story.  Memory is a fluid thing, and what we remember isn't what might have really happened.  So, these implants are a hot commodity for many reasons.I can understand why the ending confuses some people and disappoints others, but for me it's a perfect conclusion for this story and an opening for these Zoe implants to grow well beyond their original purpose.Robin Williams performance certainly didn't disappoint me - he's a great actor and this was a role where emotions rather than exciting action moved the plot and he went through a whole gammit of emotional change.I didn't give it five stars because I thought some of the plot was cliche and that there was more opportunities to use the technology as a plot device and that opportunity was missed.

I watched this movie last night with my wife and both of us kinda looked at each other after it was through and we knew what the other was thinking.  ""What happened here?""  The movie was doing so well and then lost me somewhere in the middle (I know exactly where...we'll get to that)  The 'idea' around this movie was unique and mindbending, and that much I enjoyed very much.  It is a neat concept where humans in the not so distant future have Zoe chips inserted into there brains after conception so that their lives are recorded so when they die people called ""cutters"" can make rememory videos for the familys.  So our story starts with Alan Hackman (Robin Williams) who is one of these ""cutters"".  Robin is haunted by a past involving the death of a playmate and the premature death of his parents and this has turned him into somewhat of a hermit.  Welcome Della (Mina Sorvino), Alan's much younger (kinda creepy) on-off girlfried who finds it difficult to connect with the distant and confined Alan.  Alan is obsorbed in his work, a complete work-a-holic and he is one of the only ""cutters"" who will work with ""the scum of society"" as you may call them (the wife beaters and child molesters).  Alan's job is to make these people appear to be saints.  Enter Fletcher (Jim Caviezel), a former ""cutter"" who is determined to stop the Zoe implants from being placed in humans.  A group of 'rebels' sort-of-speak are banding together to get the Zoe distribution stopped.  They feel it's moraly wrong.  When a member of the 'Zoe' organization dies and Alan is comissioned to cut his Zoe for his rememory Fletcher is determined to get the Zoe chip and expose this man as a monster.  This makes no sense to me.  Who going to shut down a multi-million dollar organization because of ONE man?  It's inprobable.  Priests molest children all the time and we still have them...I mean come on, we couldn't even convict Michael Jackson!  Anyways, back to the story...It's about this point when they lost me.  See we all come back to these flashbacks to Alan's childhood when he meets a boy and witnesses his death (sorta) and Alan is not plauged by the fact he did nothing to save him.  He's determined to find out what really happened that day and the plot to the movie takes a dive trying to find out.  Robin does a great job portraying a hermit of a man who is tormented by his inner demons.  My favorite scene is when Alan meets with Feltcher at a train station or something like that.  They are sitting back to back and Alan is likening himself to a 'Sin-Eater' in a way to justify his making saints out of monsters.  Its a great analogy and great acting.  I was bummed to see that Cavievel and Sorvino are BARELY used (all of like 5-10 minutes screen time really) but they were added flare.

878688,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00079HZOS,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[34, 41]","I really liked The Final Cut.  It may not have enough excitement to appeal to some viewers, but it is intense in its own narrow, low-key fashion.  The story takes place in a futuristic setting, but rookie writer/director Omar Naim doesn't approach the story from a what-if science fiction angle; this is really the story of one man's inner soul and how one significant memory can haunt you even as it is shaping your destiny.The story is centered on a fascinating premise - that one's memories can be recorded and played back after the individual's death.  The Zoe chip makes this possible; it's a synthetic implant that grows along with you as it records every single moment of your life.  After your death, a sort of highlight reel of your most significant memories is put together and shown in a special Rememory service for all your family and friends to watch.  Condensing someone's life into a couple of hours is a tough job, and it takes a talented professional cutter to do the job right.  Alan Hackman (Williams) is one of the best cutters out there.  He sees everything from each person's life, including some pretty awful stuff, but he gives the family the good memories they yearn for.  There are plenty of protesters out there opposed to the Zoe chip, including one of Alan's old colleagues.  Like leftist protest groups everywhere, these guys have no problem resorting to intimidation and violence - they only worry about the ethics of their opponents, not their own.  Everything comes to a head when one of the bigshots behind the Zoe chip dies.  Hackman has the job of cutting the Rememory, but the protestors want the data in order to pin something on the dead guy and bring down the company.Hackman sees someone in the subject's memories that take him back to a memory that has haunted him his entire life.  He rather desperately tries to find the individual and gain some kind of psychological closure for himself, throwing his monotonous life into turmoil and placing himself in great danger.  It's a mission of self-discovery - and that only complicates matters.The Final Cut showcases a great story - dark and personally claustrophobic, poignant, and always fascinating.  Happy it isn't, nor is it conventional.  It is serious, intelligent, and contemplative, raising all sorts of moral questions on both sides of the Rememory debate.  By this point, we all know that Robin Williams is a master of drama as well as comedy, but it is still somewhat mesmerizing to see him carry this entire movie with his remarkably low-key persona.  Some people may not like the dark cinematography and tone of the film, but I think they are great strengths that reinforce the artificial nature of the whole Rememory business.

Parents pay for the implant on their child: later grandchildren and widows/widowers celebrate the deceased in a movie that has subtracted anything negative from the manipulated departed.  Sound like a good idea for a movie?  Yes, and it has been used in many other permutations before.The main problem with this silly mess of a film is the casting.  Robin Williams is cast as a quiet but desperate cutter, a role much in line with all of his current dark, weirdo psychopaths that he simply does not perform well. He does comedy well, if I remember correctly.

878696,A2H9VMR8QRLINY,B00079HZOS,granite,"[2, 2]","Despite its flaws, this was a highly original story, definitely recommended as a rental.The movie is set in the near future where a company called EYES is successfully marketing a chip, called the Zoe implant, which turns people into living VCRs. You won't miss a minute of your life. You can preserve all your experiences for your family. Incidentally, however, you are recording everybody else as well, who may or may not want all their actions to be preserved for all to see. Some people would like to decide for themselves what part of their lives is made available for public consumption.The film does a great job of raising a number of questions that might arise with the use of this technology through the experience of Alan Hakman (Williams), a cutter. When you have a technology that records absolutely everything you have done, you need an editor who cuts the film of your life to a 5-minute segment to be shown as part of the funeral service. To edit is to select, so the cutter's job requires a great deal of discretion. The more influential and evil you were in your life, the more discretion you need at your funeral. To prevent abuses (or justice, depending on one's point of view) cutters abide by a strict three-part code: 1) A cutter may not sell or give away footage 2) A cutter may not have a Zoe implant 3) A cutter may not edit together footage from different lives for a Rememory service (or something like this)Hakman is the best at his job which he understands as helping the living to go on. He is discreet, never questions what he is asked to do, until one footage brings up an issue from his own past. In the course of the film, he will be tempted to violate/find himself in violation of various aspects of the cutter's code.The reason why I gave this movie only four starts is because it is far better at raising questions than telling a story. What we really have in this movie is an attempt to think through the implications of such a technology, by showing beneficial and harmful aspects of it and its influence on people's lives. Is our memory always accurate? Would a technology like this help us to live our lives better or doom us? Is it ethical to show only the best aspects of a person's life when a more balanced view could be presented? Who should control access to the footage? Is some information so vital that it has to be made available even if doing so would go against the will of the family?Final Cut is closest to a set of little case studies, each one highlighting an aspect of living in a widely-accepted surveillance society.

Set in the future, he operates a business that is responsible for ""editing"" the memories of rich, dead executive-types who's families want their memories to digitally be replayed during their funeral ceremonies. Some offer as much as $500,000 to Hakman for his services, and the sum of money is typically predicated on just how many skeletons the recently expired loved-ones had in their overpriced closets, and just how good a job he does at ""cutting"" those memories.Hakman is himself no saint.

I found myself wishing for a cameo by Mork, or perhaps even Mindy, to lighten the mood.It's sometime in the future. Affluent parents can have an implant placed in their unborn child's brain that'll record all the sights and sounds seen and heard during that individual's life from birth until death. Then, after death, the implant's data are able to be downloaded into a computer as a series of scenes sequentially numbered according to the person's age in years, days and hours. Those vignettes can be edited by a ""Cutter"" to create a visual remembrance of the deceased. A sort of ""This Is the Best of Your Life"" souvenir for the survivors. Alan Hakman (Robin Williams) is such a Cutter, one of the best in the business when it comes to cleaning up a depraved life's visual record into something suitable for family viewing at the wake.A childhood trauma involving the accidental death of a playmate, as well as the early demise of his own parents in an auto accident, have left Alan devoid of much emotion. Rather, he experiences life vicariously through his cutting jobs. According to one of the rules of the profession, a Cutter cannot have an implant. Alan discovers by chance that he has one, not being told about it by Mom and Pop before they were killed. So, the essence of the film becomes that old saw, ""He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword"", as Hakman comes into conflict with a renegade Cutter (James Caviezel) now running with the right-to-privacy militants that want to put the kabosh on implant technology.Once again, Williams shows that he's an exceptional dramatic actor at the complete opposite of the spectrum from MORK AND MINDY. Because of Robin's performance and the reasonably clever concept of the implant technology, I wish I could've liked this film more, but couldn't because the central plot was so unengaging and turned-back on itself. It didn't go anywhere that made me sit up and say ""Way cool!"". The script was perhaps conceived by a film editor with a vicious hangover. It didn't help that the cinematography was moody and joyless - dark rooms, dark streets, and dark buildings. Even the Cutters' workstations were constructed of gloomy, retro-looking wood. And Caviezel's character elicited nothing from me whatsoever.

878706,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B00079HZOS,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[2, 2]","I started out not buying the premise and thinking that this is just another Hollywood formula with typical tired old plot elements: futuristic setting, ""evil"" corporations exploiting the masses, the rich being portrayed as flaming jerks, the protagonist as the anti-corporate crusader etc (e.g. ""The Island"").  Then as I hung in there watching, I eventually bought the premise (that in the near future a company would sell special implanted chips that record a person's entire life) and this movie then grabbed my attention with its orginality and plot twists.  And Williams is great.  This movie's appeal is aided by the film's concept (""what if you could implant such chips, what would happen to society?"") and in its ability to pack in a lot into a lean 1 1/2 hours (seems faster).Soon (in 20 years?), because of the rapid pace of technology, science will be able to accomplish what the movie portrays: implanted devices that can record your vision and hearing for a lifetime.  This is a fascinating premise actually, which the movie ALMOST gets right.  When the technology is available for real, some people may want to get it voluntarily.  The movie's idea of parents doing this for their children, though, is actually a little strange.  Parents want to be able to remember their children's lives from their own point of view, and most people want to remember their own lives, but I would think that very FEW people would want continuous recordings of their loved-ones lives.  You don't want to see your loved one in the toilet or doing hidden immoral or criminal things.  So actually, I still don't totally buy the film's premise, but it's a fascinating idea nonetheless.(Warning: some spoiler material below)At any rate, Williams plays a man who gets paid (a ""cutter"") editing people's saved ""data"" into neat 2-hour films that are watched by their loved ones when they die.  Obviously he knows all the bad stuff about his clients, but he has to cut all that stuff out.  At the same time, there's a lot of people in society at large who are rebelling at finding out when they are adults, that they had these chips implanted.  These folks get special tatoos with magnetic ink, that interferes with the chip recordings, so that they can go on with their lives un-surveilled (wouldn't you?).  Williams then runs into a case where a man's wife is paying him to edit out her deceased husband's particularly nasty secret life, involving their daughter.  This is a disturbing idea, but very within the realm of possibility.  The plot thickens when the man used to work for the chip-making corporation, and a former cutter is spearheading an effort to discredit the corporation with the truth about this man, and tries to coerce Williams with threats of violence.  The plot further thickens when William's own deep, dark secret about a tragic fatal (?) accident with a boyhood acquaintance comes out.  So Williams is trying to deal with the present situation while trying to find the truth about his dark past. He goes back into his past using a special application of the implant technology (I won't tell you how.)  It all comes out in a strong climax near the movie's end that creatively avoids Hollywood stereotyping (maybe because the producer isn't mainstream Hollywood?).  I think the film is definitely worthwhile viewing because of this.I just recently saw a photo of a girl that I had a crush on in high school, whom I hadn't seen in 37 years.  It was on Facebook, depicted her as a teenager, and instantly brought back memories (not to worry I'm not stalking!).  I got a small euphoric feeling of what it would be like to have such a chip implanted and bring back ancient memories. BUT, I would want to view MY OWN implanted data when I'm old, and DEFINITELY NOT want others to view it when I die!  So if this technology ever comes along, they'll have to figure that conundrum out.I give ""The Final Cut"" 4 stars for actual creativity in this film, and for Williams' usual excellent acting job as the protagonist.",4,I started out not liking it and ended up liking it,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,4020,"['started', 'out', 'not', 'buying', 'premise', 'thinking', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'typical', 'tired', 'old', 'plot', 'elements', 'futuristic', 'setting', 'evil', 'corporations', 'exploiting', 'masses', 'rich', 'being', 'portrayed', 'flaming', 'jerks', 'protagonist', 'anti-corporate', 'crusader', 'etc', 'e.g', 'Island', 'Then', 'hung', 'watching', 'eventually', 'bought', 'premise', 'near', 'future', 'company', 'would', 'sell', 'special', 'implanted', 'chips', 'record', 'person', 'entire', 'life', 'movie', 'then', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'orginality', 'plot', 'twists', 'Williams', 'great', 'movie', 'appeal', 'aided', 'film', 'concept', 'what', 'could', 'implant', 'such', 'chips', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'society', 'ability', 'pack', 'lot', 'lean', '1', '1/2', 'hours', 'faster', '.Soon', '20', 'years', 'rapid', 'pace', 'technology', 'science', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'accomplish', 'what', 'movie', 'implanted', 'devices', 'can', 'record', 'vision', 'hearing', 'lifetime', 'fascinating', 'premise', 'actually', 'movie', 'ALMOST', 'right', 'When', 'technology', 'available', 'real', 'people', 'may', 'want', 'get', 'voluntarily', 'movie', 'idea', 'parents', 'doing', 'children', 'actually', 'little', 'strange', 'Parents', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'remember', 'children', 'lives', 'own', 'point', 'view', 'most', 'people', 'want', 'remember', 'own', 'lives', 'would', 'think', 'very', 'FEW', 'people', 'would', 'want', 'continuous', 'recordings', 'loved-ones', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'loved', 'one', 'toilet', 'doing', 'hidden', 'immoral', 'criminal', 'things', 'So', 'actually', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'totally', 'buy', 'film', 'premise', 'fascinating', 'idea', 'nonetheless', 'Warning', 'spoiler', 'material', 'rate', 'Williams', 'man', 'who', 'paid', 'cutter', 'editing', 'people', 'saved', 'data', 'neat', '2-hour', 'films', 'are', 'watched', 'loved', 'ones', 'when', 'die', 'Obviously', 'bad', 'stuff', 'clients', 'cut', 'stuff', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'lot', 'people', 'society', 'large', 'who', 'are', 'rebelling', 'finding', 'out', 'when', 'are', 'adults', 'had', 'chips', 'implanted', 'folks', 'get', 'special', 'tatoos', 'magnetic', 'ink', 'chip', 'recordings', 'can', 'go', 'lives', 'un-surveilled', 'would', ""n't"", 'Williams', 'then', 'case', 'where', 'man', 'wife', 'paying', 'edit', 'out', 'deceased', 'husband', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'secret', 'life', 'involving', 'daughter', 'disturbing', 'idea', 'very', 'realm', 'possibility', 'plot', 'when', 'man', 'used', 'work', 'chip-making', 'corporation', 'former', 'cutter', 'spearheading', 'effort', 'discredit', 'corporation', 'truth', 'man', 'tries', 'coerce', 'Williams', 'threats', 'violence', 'plot', 'further', 'thickens', 'when', 'William', 'own', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'tragic', 'fatal', 'accident', 'boyhood', 'acquaintance', 'out', 'So', 'Williams', 'trying', 'deal', 'present', 'situation', 'trying', 'find', 'truth', 'dark', 'past', 'back', 'past', 'using', 'special', 'application', 'implant', 'technology', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'out', 'strong', 'climax', 'movie', 'end', 'creatively', 'Hollywood', 'stereotyping', 'maybe', 'producer', ""n't"", 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'film', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', 'this.I', 'just', 'recently', 'saw', 'photo', 'girl', 'had', 'crush', 'high', 'school', 'whom', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', '37', 'years', 'was', 'Facebook', 'depicted', 'teenager', 'instantly', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'not', 'worry', ""'m"", 'not', 'stalking', 'got', 'small', 'euphoric', 'feeling', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'chip', 'implanted', 'bring', 'back', 'ancient', 'memories', 'BUT', 'would', 'want', 'view', 'MY', 'OWN', 'implanted', 'data', 'when', ""'m"", 'old', 'DEFINITELY', 'NOT', 'want', 'others', 'view', 'when', 'die', 'So', 'technology', 'ever', 'along', ""'ll"", 'have', 'figure', 'conundrum', 'out.I', 'give', 'Final', 'Cut', '4', 'stars', 'actual', 'creativity', 'film', 'Williams', 'usual', 'excellent', 'acting', 'job', 'protagonist']",The Final Cut
878707,A3IM77LLZAN8B6,B00079HZOS,J. W. Hickey,"[4, 5]","The amazon reviewer says this film has a lackluster screenplay.  It had more than sufficient luster for my tastes.  There are a number of particularly refreshing choices in the plot development, with a steady eye on character rather than facile action cartooning.  The response of co-workers when they discover the main character's secret does advance the plot expediently, but also suggests a more dimensionally warm world than, say, *Seconds* or most other semi-futuristic nightmare stories.  And the romance element doesn't get as discomforting as it threatens to be, given the disparity in age and type between the two performers.  At first viewing I feared the kids' scene was just another cruelty exercise, but nothing in this script is wasted or gratuitous.  You want slo-mo motorcycle crashes through plate-glass windows, look elsewhere.  You want ""luster"" worth repeated viewings, this fills the bill.The cinematography is excellent, by the same artist who went from this film to shooting the (much superior to its sources) remake of *Manchurian Candidate*.  Neither of these films did as well as anticipated at the box office, and both are superior, chilling social commentaries.And unlike a growing number of director commentaries (Norman Jewison in particular, who thinks it's his job to explain the plot frame by frame rather than provide nuances of decisions and behind-the-scenes problems that were solved or remain hidden glitches), this film's director commentary demonstrates how the job should be done (right up there with *Shattered Glass*, *Runaway Jury*, *Kinsey*, *Wag the Dog*, and, yes, the *Manchurian Candidate* remake).

Final Cut is a movie which actually challenges movie goers to think and not just escape into the latest implausable fantasy - like the young, poor woman marrying a prince or a superhero winning yet another battle against crime. Those movies have their place but so do simpler, richly told movies like Final Cut, which is so much more than just an escapist fantasy.Final Cut focuses on ""cutters"", people whose job is to edit implanted chips placed in humans, chips which record their memories from birth to death. Cutters edit the chips for the funeral ceremony and they have to follow a code of ethics. Robin Williams is one such cutter and he has secrets of his own, ones that only unfold as the movie goes on. He is haunted by one particular memory and his need to find answers to ""what really happened"" is at the heart of this movie.The tone of the film is dark and somber, which may explain why it faded quickly from public view.  But it is still worth seeing, for so many reasons, including the ethical questions it raises:1. How would one change one's behavior if one KNEW that every single act was being recorded?2. Would an implanted chip in one's brain cause one to commit fewer crimes (knowing they'd be recorded?) or entice one to take risks, knowing one wouldn't be ""found out"" until after death (assuming the law doesn't catch up until then?)3. What is the role of the cutter, the person who edits the films of one's life? Should he or she leave only the best parts, omitting the little (or big) sins?And so forth. This film explores all these questions. Where it disappoints is in the final minutes, which doesn't result in a satisfying (or fully understandable) resolution. The viewer is left wondering exactly what will happen next.Part of the problem is the fact that this seems to be TWO movies- one is a philosophical examination of what implants would MEAN and how they'd affect human interpretations of the world and one another...and the other movie is a personal mystery/drama.As such, it is never boring, but there are too many loose ends and dropped connections to make for a satisfying whole. That is my main quibble with this film. But I'd watch it again in a heartbeat, if only to see Robin Williams remarkable performance.

878711,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00079HZOS,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 4]","Final Cut might seem to be a title that goes with a gory slasher film, but this is not the case.  The director Omar Naim offers the audience a sublime science fiction tale that does not transcends beyond humanity, as it remains very real and authentic to which the audience can relate.  Yet, the film never becomes predictable or boring, as it keeps the audience trying to think ahead while keeping the audience tied in suspense to what is presented on the screen.  This film is warmly recommended, as it never received the attention it deserves in the theaters.In a possible future, science has created a way to implant an organic recorder, a so-called Zoe implant, which stores all the sounds and images that the person experiences from birth until death.  This implant is inserted into the person before conception, and the parents will not inform the child about the device until a mature age when the person can deal with the psychological stress that this device might generate.  The memories then become accessible for future generations and can be accessed in a similar manner in which a database of information is.  However, the information is left to a person called a cutter who edits the memories in a manner desired by the deceased's family members.The Cutter has a code that they must maintain:1.  A Cutter cannot give away or sell any Zoe footage.2.  A Cutter cannot have a Zoe implant.3.  A Cutter cannot mix Zoe footage from different lives for a Rememory.Alan W. Hakman (Robin Williams) is such a cutter who only works alone.  A traumatic experience from Alan's childhood appears to continue to induce strong feelings of guilt within him.  It seems as if the internal guilt that he suffers from has led him to become a cutter who edits people's memories.  Through his job he can emphasize on the good and pleasant memories of the deceased while shouldering other's sins.His success has led him to be hired by individuals that want him edit the most horrific cases that contain some truly disturbing memories, memories that most people would turn their head away from, as they are disgusting and vile.  Nonetheless, Alan becomes their sin-eater who removes their sins from their memories, and provides a commemorative service to people who want to experience the positive side of the departed person despite past transgressions.Alan merely exists, without judgment or prejudice, as he edits away the nastiness of other people's lives.  He does not do much besides working and looking into other people's lives.  A female friend, played by Mira Sorvino, tells him that he must get a life of his own, and not try to live through others.  It might suggest that Alan is into voyeurism, but this notion is never elaborated.  Instead Alan has a constant weary expression on his face as if he held a greater wisdom.  Yet, Alan never comes across as arrogant, but rather he displays an affectionate sympathy and deeper understanding for other's feelings.A growing organization is raising their voice against the company that makes the Zoe implants.  The members have strange and bizarre tattoos, which indicate that they are against the idea of Zoe implants.  The leader of the organization, a former cutter named Fletcher (James Caviezel), seems to be very interested in Alan's newest assignment, as it might be a way for Fletcher to hurt the company that produces the Zoe implants.  This builds up a suspenseful angle to the story, but never becomes the main theme of the film, as Alan continues to deal with his internal guilt.Initially, the film might seem to be a suspenseful science fictions tale, however, as the story unfolds it turns into a philosophical science fiction drama.  Final Cut offers an interesting cinematic experience with a very appealing concept, which intentionally leaves the audience with the purpose of triggering deeper contemplation.  Robin Williams's performance is remarkable, as it brings a face with authentic weariness and concern, which projects the feelings that Alan might be feeling inside to the audience.  Omar Naim does a wonderful job in both directing and writing the story, as he does not force an opinion on the audience, but lets the audience think for themselves in regards to the issues at hand.",4,A Sublime Science Fiction Tale...,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,4254,"['Final', 'Cut', 'might', 'seem', 'be', 'title', 'gory', 'slasher', 'film', 'not', 'case', 'director', 'Omar', 'Naim', 'audience', 'sublime', 'science', 'fiction', 'tale', 'not', 'transcends', 'humanity', 'very', 'real', 'authentic', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'film', 'never', 'predictable', 'boring', 'audience', 'trying', 'think', 'ahead', 'keeping', 'audience', 'tied', 'suspense', 'what', 'presented', 'screen', 'film', 'warmly', 'recommended', 'never', 'received', 'attention', 'theaters.In', 'possible', 'future', 'science', 'created', 'way', 'implant', 'organic', 'recorder', 'so-called', 'Zoe', 'implant', 'stores', 'sounds', 'images', 'person', 'experiences', 'birth', 'death', 'implant', 'inserted', 'person', 'conception', 'parents', 'will', 'not', 'inform', 'child', 'device', 'mature', 'age', 'when', 'person', 'can', 'deal', 'psychological', 'stress', 'device', 'might', 'generate', 'memories', 'then', 'become', 'accessible', 'future', 'generations', 'can', 'be', 'accessed', 'similar', 'manner', 'database', 'information', 'However', 'information', 'left', 'person', 'called', 'cutter', 'who', 'memories', 'manner', 'desired', 'deceased', 'family', 'members.The', 'Cutter', 'code', 'must', 'maintain:1', 'Cutter', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'sell', 'Zoe', 'footage.2', 'Cutter', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'Zoe', 'implant.3', 'Cutter', 'can', 'not', 'mix', 'Zoe', 'footage', 'different', 'lives', 'Rememory.Alan', 'W.', 'Hakman', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'such', 'cutter', 'who', 'only', 'alone', 'A', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'Alan', 'childhood', 'continue', 'induce', 'strong', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'internal', 'guilt', 'led', 'become', 'cutter', 'who', 'people', 'memories', 'job', 'can', 'emphasize', 'good', 'pleasant', 'memories', 'deceased', 'shouldering', 'other', 'sins.His', 'success', 'led', 'be', 'hired', 'individuals', 'want', 'edit', 'most', 'horrific', 'cases', 'contain', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'memories', 'memories', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'turn', 'head', 'away', 'are', 'disgusting', 'vile', 'Nonetheless', 'Alan', 'sin-eater', 'who', 'sins', 'memories', 'commemorative', 'service', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'experience', 'positive', 'side', 'departed', 'person', 'past', 'transgressions.Alan', 'merely', 'judgment', 'prejudice', 'away', 'nastiness', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'working', 'looking', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'female', 'friend', 'played', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'must', 'get', 'life', 'own', 'not', 'try', 'live', 'others', 'might', 'suggest', 'Alan', 'voyeurism', 'notion', 'never', 'elaborated', 'Instead', 'Alan', 'constant', 'weary', 'expression', 'face', 'held', 'greater', 'wisdom', 'Alan', 'never', 'across', 'arrogant', 'rather', 'affectionate', 'sympathy', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'other', 'feelings.A', 'growing', 'organization', 'raising', 'voice', 'company', 'Zoe', 'implants', 'members', 'have', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'tattoos', 'indicate', 'are', 'idea', 'Zoe', 'implants', 'leader', 'organization', 'former', 'cutter', 'named', 'Fletcher', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'be', 'very', 'interested', 'Alan', 'newest', 'assignment', 'might', 'be', 'way', 'Fletcher', 'hurt', 'company', 'Zoe', 'implants', 'up', 'suspenseful', 'angle', 'story', 'never', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'Alan', 'deal', 'internal', 'guilt.Initially', 'film', 'might', 'seem', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'science', 'fictions', 'tale', 'however', 'story', 'philosophical', 'science', 'fiction', 'drama', 'Final', 'Cut', 'interesting', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'very', 'appealing', 'concept', 'intentionally', 'audience', 'purpose', 'triggering', 'deeper', 'contemplation', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'face', 'authentic', 'weariness', 'concern', 'projects', 'feelings', 'Alan', 'might', 'be', 'feeling', 'audience', 'Omar', 'Naim', 'wonderful', 'job', 'directing', 'writing', 'story', 'not', 'force', 'opinion', 'audience', 'audience', 'think', 'regards', 'issues', 'hand']",The Final Cut

People called Cutters then edit the footage to the likings of the loved ones of the deceased, and show a presentation of the chosen moments together in a movie of the person's life at a memorial service called Rememory for all friends and relatives to see.I was totally into this movie from the start just because of the central idea around the movie. As fascinating and futuristic as this idea was, it seemed very believable and realistic. This kind of idea didn't seem too far out of reach in the world we live in today. It wasn't hard for me to believe that this could happen one day.The film focuses on Cutter Alan Hackman (Robin Williams). Being a Cutter, he gets to see the worse in his clients, such as affairs and domestic violence. He of course cuts these moments from the final cut of the person's rememory film. So in a sense, he cuts out all the bad and leaves in all the good. But things get complicated when anti-Zoe Chip activists want the footage of a recently dead important Eye Tech (the manufacturer of Zoe Chips) figure to expose a scandal and Alan is the one with that footage. I won't go into too much more, but that's the general gist of it.With an interesting idea like this one that is centered around a futuristic thriller style atmosphere, The Final Cut proves to be an extremely watchable and attention holding movie from start to finish. There were just so many parts to this film I liked, such as the part about dreams and daydreams and how the Zoe Chip couldn't figure out what was actually being seen and what the mind was seeing. Or how a lot of young people who were against having a Zoe-chip inside them got electro-synth tattoos, a way to disrupt th chip, very noticeably on their faces as a way to protest the Zeo-chip. I just thought the film was very well written, and this idea of your whole life being recorded was looked at in various, realistic ways if it were actually to happen.And last but not least, Robin Williams puts on a fine performance. To be honest, I expected this film to be a futuristic One Hour Photo, but in The Final Cut, Williams' performance was matched by an equally good story.",4,A highly interesting idea for a movie,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,2397,"['not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'parents', 'can', 'implant', 'neurological', 'chip', 'called', 'Zoe', 'Chip', 'brain', 'unborn', 'baby', 'moment', 'birth', 'time', 'death', 'everything', 'seen', 'eyes', 'heard', 'ears', 'recorded', 'People', 'called', 'Cutters', 'then', 'edit', 'footage', 'likings', 'loved', 'ones', 'deceased', 'show', 'presentation', 'chosen', 'together', 'movie', 'person', 'life', 'memorial', 'service', 'called', 'Rememory', 'friends', 'relatives', 'see.I', 'was', 'totally', 'movie', 'start', 'just', 'central', 'idea', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'futuristic', 'idea', 'was', 'seemed', 'very', 'believable', 'realistic', 'kind', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'far', 'reach', 'world', 'live', 'today', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'believe', 'could', 'happen', 'one', 'day.The', 'film', 'Cutter', 'Alan', 'Hackman', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Being', 'Cutter', 'see', 'worse', 'clients', 'such', 'affairs', 'domestic', 'violence', 'course', 'cuts', 'moments', 'final', 'cut', 'person', 'rememory', 'film', 'So', 'sense', 'out', 'bad', 'good', 'things', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'anti-Zoe', 'Chip', 'activists', 'want', 'footage', 'recently', 'dead', 'important', 'Eye', 'Tech', 'manufacturer', 'Zoe', 'Chips', 'figure', 'expose', 'scandal', 'Alan', 'one', 'footage', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'general', 'gist', 'it.With', 'interesting', 'idea', 'one', 'centered', 'futuristic', 'thriller', 'style', 'atmosphere', 'Final', 'Cut', 'be', 'extremely', 'watchable', 'attention', 'holding', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'parts', 'film', 'liked', 'such', 'part', 'dreams', 'daydreams', 'how', 'Zoe', 'Chip', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'being', 'seen', 'what', 'mind', 'was', 'seeing', 'how', 'lot', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'having', 'Zoe-chip', 'got', 'electro-synth', 'tattoos', 'way', 'disrupt', 'th', 'chip', 'very', 'noticeably', 'way', 'protest', 'Zeo-chip', 'just', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'idea', 'whole', 'life', 'being', 'recorded', 'was', 'looked', 'various', 'realistic', 'ways', 'were', 'actually', 'happen.And', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'fine', 'performance', 'be', 'honest', 'expected', 'film', 'be', 'futuristic', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'Final', 'Cut', 'Williams', 'performance', 'was', 'matched', 'equally', 'good', 'story']",The Final Cut

It was almost like the writer or the director ran out of creativity or ideas of how to end the movie.  It was just really a disappointment.*The Final Cut* is a futuristic movie about how some humans are born with a zoe implant.  The zoe implant is an organic ""recorder"" that is implanted before birth.  When a person dies, a cutter retrives ""memories"" from the implant and edits them for the Rememory.  The Rememory is just another form of a memorial service except that everyone is viewing the visual (& audio) recordings of the deceased.Alan Hackman (Williams) is a reputable cutter.  He is recommended by a fellow cutter to take over a particular case.  This particular case, as Hackman discovers, is a wealthy man who has a scandalous past.  However, in the midst of editing for the Rememory, Hackman recognizes a man in the recordings.  This particular man was a childhood friend of Alan's who died from a freak accident.  Hackman is obsessed and starts his own investigation to find this man.Meanwhile, a former cutter and colleague of Hackman's wants this particular wealthy case as well.  It is not explicitly clear why he wants this case, even though he is against this whole cutting/Rememory thing.  Thus, a cat and mouse chase begins.The whole movie is a great concept.  The build-up/suspense was just fabulous.  However, when I got to the end, I was like...that was it?!?!  The ending was actually lame.

878714,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00079HZOS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","""The Final Cut"" takes place in a futuristic world in which the EYE (Everything You Experience) Corporation is able to put a Zoe implant in a person's brain, usually before they are born.  That implant will record everything they see and hear throughout their entire life and when they die it will be removed, the lifetime of memories downloaded, and an editor, known as a ""Cutter,"" puts together a film of ""rememeories"" to be show to family and friends at a service for the dearly departed.  The Cutter, one character observes, is like a magician, priest and taxidermist all rolled into one, and in this 2004 film we meet the best Cutter of them all.But when we first meet Alan W. Hakman he is a young boy (Casey Dubois) whose has a misadventure with another young boy (Liam Ranger).  The incident is the most important in Alan's life and makes him the man he becomes.  The adult Alan (Robin Williams) is the most gifted of the Cutters, willing to look at the dark side of lives where others refuse.  A wealthy widow (Stephanie Romanov) hires Hakman to create a Rememory of her husband, who was a rich and famous man but not a good man.  She trusts Hakman to delete the unsavory parts of his life.  Alan has no qualms about this, because his service is not for the dead but for the living and his goal is to allow people to remember the deceased the way they want to remember them (even if a boat turns out to be red instead of green).  Alan's work is his life, and his attempts to connect with Delila (Mira Sorvino) are clumsy and rather unmotivated.But there are those who oppose the Zoe implants, who demand that people remember for themselves and special tattoos their faces so that the implants will not work.  Their leader, Fletcher (James Caviezel), is a former Cutter who wants to buy the dead man's memories to expose the truth and make the world a better place.  Hakman refuses, but then something happens that gives him a personal interest in those memories and shakes him out of the lethargy that is his life.  For the first time in a long time Alan cares desperately about himself more than those for whom he performs his service.It takes a while for all of the pieces to fall together in this film and that becomes problematic because my mind kept drifting to the whole concept of the Zoe implants.  The selling point is that you memories will be shared with your loved ones, but would we really want that?  You have to trust a stranger not to show your loved ones the things you do not want them to see and if it was a question of sharing memories the person I want to share them with would be myself.  Then there are the legal issues involved with regards to privacy, but in a world where one person in twenty has a Zoe implant would you not want access to what witnesses see at crimes and accidents?  There are so many questions raised by the idea of such a technology, but ""The Final Cut"" does not have time to deal with them.However, the film does raise what is probably the key issue, which has to do with how would people act if they knew they were being recorded?  Is there some perverse thrill in getting away with things when you know for a fact the crime is being ""watched""?  It is never mentioned, but surely the Heisenberg principle is coming into play here, which would have profound philosophical questions worth debating.  But writer-director Omar Naim gives away a bit of the game when the prologue ends and we are treated to three key elements of the code of the Cutters, because this means we should expect to see these rules broken during the course of the film.  Consequently, the idea of the Zoe implants is both the promise and the failure of ""The Final Cut,"" because as we struggle to understand the rules and their implications, the narrative insists on breaking them for the sake of drama.The final shot of the film is a cheat and the people who put together ""The Final Cut"" admit as much in one of the special features.

878715,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00079HZOS,Lawyeraau,"[1, 3]","This is a dark and moody futuristic film. In the film, affluent parents a pre-natal recording chip implant for their children. The implant, called the ""Zoe"" chip, records that individual's lifetime memories in real time. When the individual dies, the implanted chip in which all of the individuals memories are recorded, is removed and given to a ""cutter"". The job of the cutter is to basically edit the memories of the deceased and create a full length feature film of the memories of the deceased. This film is then shown at a ""re-memory"" ceremony held on behalf of the deceased, where the dearly departed is remembered the way that those left behind among the living would like.Alan Hakman (Robin Williams) is the best cutter in the business. His handling of the memories of the deceased always end up with a film that makes everyone happy, even though the memorial portrait of the deceased may bear little resemblance to the way that the individual may have actually been in life. Alan likens himself to a modern day, functional equivalent of the sin eaters of old. He views his job as one of basically washing away the sins of the deceased for the sake of the living. Obviously, due to the extremely intimate and personal nature of what he does, a cutter cannot be someone who himself has an implant.Alan is a stunted human being, due to a traumatic childhood experience involving a newly made friend. He was also orphaned at an early age. So, he is a guy who is really not too in touch with his feelings. He has a girlfriend, sort of-kind of, named Delila (Mira Sorvino), with whom he is trying, however badly, to establish a connection. Somehow, the path of true love does not go too smoothly for Alan.One day, Alan is hired to do the final cutting for a deceased executive of the corporation that makes the implant. He is definitely a man with some truly serious moral issues, but his widow wants his life to be well remembered in the community, so she is looking for a whitewash. Of course, zealous activists who are against the ""Zoe"" chip, viewing the implant as an invasion of privacy, would like nothing better than to look into the deep recesses of the mind of the deceased in hopes of finding something that will embarrass the corporation that promulgates the implant.A renegade cutter named Fletcher (James Caviezel), who has left the business, tries to bribe Alan into giving him the implant of the deceased corporate executive, but Alan refuses. It seems, however, that Fletcher and the anti-implant activists will not take no for an answer with respect to the implant of the deceased. Moreover, in scanning the memories of the deceased, Alan comes across a memory that sheds some additional light on the childhood trauma that has haunted him, and his investigation of that specific memory leads to some startling revelations for him. It is a discovery that is to have more impact on his life than he can imagine.This is somber film with performances that often seemed to be phoned in. James Caviezel adds very little in the role of Fletcher, given his one-dimensional performance. Mira Sorvino is okay in the role of Delila, but she basically had very little with which to work. Moreover, the relationship with Alan never really seems like a fit, as there is absolutely no chemistry between them. Also, Alan looks to be at least twenty years older than her in the film. Since he has little to offer in the personality or looks department, it is hard to believe that someone of Delila's age and looks would be so hot to trot with Alan. I simply do not understand why Hollywood is always so reluctant to cast age appropriate actresses.Robin Williams does his best, given what he has to work with, but it is simply not good enough to carry the film, even though his is a fine actor. While the film raises some interesting issues, given the way our technology today is headed, the issues really go nowhere and are left by the wayside. A significant problem with the film is that the viewer ends up caring very little about any of the characters. There is a big emotional disconnect not only between the characters in the film but between the viewer and the film. This stems from a poorly written screenplay and direction that is ineffective. The idea or basic premise of the film is intriguing, but it simply fails in its execution.

878716,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00079HZOS,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[6, 9]","While the premise for this movie is great--a person carries in his brain a chip implanted at birth that records all experiences throughout his/her entire life--the execution is strangely lacking. When the person dies, the chip is removed and, if the individual's family can afford it, ""processed"" by a cutter--someone skilled in extracting from the thousands of hours of recorded experience the highlights of the person's life, which are then shown at a ""rememory"", a memorial service in which the video of this life experience highlights is shown to all mourners.Aside from the confounding logistics of the cutter having enough time to select highlights from hundreds of thousands of hours of ""tape"" (for lack of a better term), there is a puzzlingly sparse emotional resonance characterizing this movie. Only very rarely do we see brief moments that capture the most poignant essence of life, or the most emotionally powerful--whether negative or positive. The filmmaker, Omar Naim, could have done so much with this terrific premise and has not. Instead we have a film that focuses on a subplot involving the main character, a cutter (Robin Williams), with a childhood experience that is permanently enmeshed in his memory, a primary plot point involving this cutter processing the ""life tape"" of a high-powered executive who's apparently hiding dark secrets from his public persona of a charitable man and loving husband, and a former cutter (Jim Caveziel) who, along with heavily tattooed protesters, opposes the entire implant-cutting technology.If Naim had instead concentrated on the deeper emotional repercussions of what having an implant signifies, this could and would have been an entirely different film--one that could potentially have been immensely rich and satisfying. A rare exception to his running off in the more superficial directions this premise lends itself to is an all-too-brief sequence in which the cutter, Alan Hakman, shows his girlfriend (Mira Sorvino) a short ""tape"" of ""defective"" implant recording in which for whatever reason the implant in various people recorded their dreams rather than real life. The results possess this rich, emotionally resonant flavor we really want to see given the great premise.This could have been a phenomenal science fiction-based drama. Instead we have a disappointing SF thriller that spends too much time on the outer layers and nowhere near enough time and energy investigating how people emotionally respond to this phenomenon--what they feel, not what they have to run from, which instead is the real core of this movie.",3,Curiously thin,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,2594,"['premise', 'movie', 'great', 'person', 'brain', 'chip', 'implanted', 'birth', 'experiences', 'his/her', 'entire', 'life', 'execution', 'strangely', 'lacking', 'When', 'person', 'chip', 'removed', 'individual', 'family', 'can', 'afford', 'processed', 'cutter', 'someone', 'skilled', 'extracting', 'thousands', 'hours', 'recorded', 'experience', 'highlights', 'person', 'life', 'are', 'then', 'shown', 'rememory', 'memorial', 'service', 'video', 'life', 'experience', 'highlights', 'shown', 'mourners.Aside', 'confounding', 'logistics', 'cutter', 'having', 'enough', 'time', 'select', 'highlights', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'hours', 'tape', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'puzzlingly', 'sparse', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'characterizing', 'movie', 'Only', 'very', 'rarely', 'do', 'see', 'brief', 'moments', 'capture', 'most', 'poignant', 'essence', 'life', 'most', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'negative', 'positive', 'filmmaker', 'Omar', 'Naim', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'terrific', 'premise', 'not', 'Instead', 'have', 'film', 'subplot', 'involving', 'main', 'character', 'cutter', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'childhood', 'experience', 'permanently', 'enmeshed', 'memory', 'primary', 'plot', 'point', 'involving', 'cutter', 'processing', 'life', 'tape', 'high-powered', 'executive', 'who', 'apparently', 'hiding', 'dark', 'secrets', 'public', 'persona', 'charitable', 'man', 'loving', 'husband', 'former', 'cutter', 'Jim', 'Caveziel', 'who', 'heavily', 'tattooed', 'protesters', 'entire', 'implant-cutting', 'technology.If', 'Naim', 'had', 'instead', 'concentrated', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'repercussions', 'what', 'having', 'implant', 'signifies', 'could', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'different', 'film', 'one', 'could', 'potentially', 'have', 'been', 'immensely', 'rich', 'satisfying', 'rare', 'exception', 'running', 'off', 'more', 'superficial', 'directions', 'premise', 'all-too-brief', 'sequence', 'cutter', 'Alan', 'Hakman', 'girlfriend', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'short', 'tape', 'defective', 'implant', 'recording', 'reason', 'implant', 'various', 'people', 'recorded', 'dreams', 'rather', 'real', 'life', 'results', 'rich', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'flavor', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'given', 'great', 'premise.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'phenomenal', 'science', 'fiction-based', 'drama', 'Instead', 'have', 'disappointing', 'SF', 'thriller', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'outer', 'layers', 'nowhere', 'enough', 'time', 'energy', 'investigating', 'how', 'people', 'emotionally', 'respond', 'phenomenon', 'what', 'feel', 'not', 'what', 'have', 'run', 'instead', 'real', 'core', 'movie']",The Final Cut

Alan Hakman (Robin Williams) is an expert cutter, one of the most skilled and in demand for the excellence of his work. Accepting an extremely difficult assignment, the man in question hiding venal secrets, Hakman is expected to erase this potential embarrassment for the widow of the deceased, the founder of the company that pioneered the Zoe Implants, although opposition groups desperately plot to access this material to discredit the entire project.During the course of transcribing, the desperately lonely, work-obsessed Hakman accidentally discovers a piece of his own past, critical ties to an event that informed the direction of his entire life. Trapped in a web of personal need and repulsion for the man's personal history, Hakman is in an impossible conundrum, a victim of the technology that will either free or damn him. The key to Hakman's dilemma is the personal element that intrudes into the sterile environment of technology, where victory goes to the highest bidder and the well-being of the many is ignored for expedience.

I believe that whoever had written the back cover had either heard about the movie from ""a friend of a friend of a friend"" or was trying to tout this movie as something exciting to elicit sales (What, advertisers lie??  Never!!).That said, this movie is definitely worth a look.  This movie is about a cutter named Alan Hackman (played by the ably-gifted actor, Robin Williams) who edits footage taken from organic implants (""Zoe"") and presents the footage as a ""Rememory"" video, typically 2 hours long, as part of an overall funeral service - presumably after a funeral, although this is never made clear.The film does present some interesting, albeit obvious, moral questions with such a system.  Are Zoe implants an invasion of privacy for others?  Would such technology force society into a behavioral mode where they are afraid to act in certain ways for fear of being filmed?  Is the ""Rememory"" video just a farce because it does little more but show the good sides of people and eliminates the bad?  Are we destroying the very foundation of the WAY people remember events, the way that people PREFER to remember them?But then there's the rebuttal.  Aren't ""Rememory"" videos any different than how we treat funerals and how we talk about people after they die?  Don't we try to focus on the good things in a person's life?  Are we truly invading privacy when the relatives of the deceased are consulted about what they would like to see in their videos?  Aren't ""Rememory"" videos providing what people want anyway - to see our loved ones happy, making other people happy?It's hard to say and certainly here in America, one can see how such technology would become extremely controversial in the space of a heartbeat.I won't spoil too much of the story beyond its premise and the debate that it elicits.  I give the movie 4 stars, however, only because some (not all) of the ""Rememory"" footage in the movie seems somewhat contrived and ""acted"" - it never seems to engage us completely as someone's life.Just as a side note - someone had mentioned in a previous review that it would be impossible to edit someone's life when someone could live to well over 540,000 hours.  Ok, yes, I buy that.  It does seem somewhat ludicrous, but consider this:1.  Of those 540,000 hours, you could consider that 180,000 hours of that are spent sleeping.2.  The remaining 360,000 hours would still remain a pretty daunting task.  But, consider that the Zoe chip is organic in nature.  Could you use chemical and neurological (electrical) precursors to highlight moments of certain emotions and stress?  And you could certainly timecode everything....3.  Also, consider that the relatives are consulted about what they would like to see.  It seems that the editing machine in this movie is perfectly capable of running searches based on images and spoken words.So, although it's still somewhat far-fetched, I think this movie does a resonable job in showing that a somewhat monumental task could still be possible.",4,Definitely worth a look...,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,3156,"['would', 'have', 'agree', 'synopsis', 'Amazon', 'certainly', 'work', 'better', 'somber', 'mood', 'piece', 'rather', 'futuristic', 'thriller', 'believe', 'whoever', 'had', 'written', 'back', 'cover', 'had', 'heard', 'movie', 'friend', 'friend', 'friend', 'was', 'trying', 'tout', 'movie', 'something', 'exciting', 'elicit', 'sales', 'What', 'advertisers', 'lie', 'Never', 'said', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'movie', 'cutter', 'named', 'Alan', 'Hackman', 'played', 'ably-gifted', 'actor', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'footage', 'taken', 'organic', 'implants', 'Zoe', 'footage', 'Rememory', 'video', 'typically', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'part', 'overall', 'funeral', 'service', 'presumably', 'funeral', 'never', 'made', 'clear.The', 'film', 'present', 'interesting', 'albeit', 'obvious', 'moral', 'questions', 'system', 'Are', 'Zoe', 'implants', 'invasion', 'privacy', 'others', 'Would', 'such', 'technology', 'force', 'society', 'behavioral', 'mode', 'where', 'are', 'afraid', 'act', 'certain', 'ways', 'fear', 'being', 'filmed', 'Rememory', 'video', 'just', 'farce', 'little', 'more', 'show', 'good', 'sides', 'people', 'bad', 'Are', 'destroying', 'very', 'foundation', 'WAY', 'people', 'remember', 'events', 'way', 'people', 'PREFER', 'remember', 'then', 'rebuttal', 'Are', ""n't"", 'Rememory', 'different', 'how', 'treat', 'funerals', 'how', 'talk', 'people', 'die', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'focus', 'good', 'things', 'person', 'life', 'Are', 'truly', 'invading', 'privacy', 'when', 'relatives', 'deceased', 'are', 'consulted', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'videos', 'Are', ""n't"", 'Rememory', 'videos', 'providing', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'anyway', 'see', 'loved', 'ones', 'happy', 'making', 'other', 'people', 'happy', 'hard', 'say', 'certainly', 'here', 'America', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'such', 'technology', 'would', 'become', 'extremely', 'controversial', 'space', 'heartbeat.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'premise', 'debate', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'however', 'only', 'not', 'Rememory', 'footage', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'contrived', 'acted', 'never', 'engage', 'completely', 'someone', 'life.Just', 'side', 'note', 'someone', 'had', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'edit', 'someone', 'life', 'when', 'someone', 'could', 'live', 'well', '540,000', 'hours', 'Ok', 'yes', 'buy', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'ludicrous', 'consider', 'this:1', '540,000', 'hours', 'could', 'consider', '180,000', 'hours', 'are', 'spent', 'sleeping.2', 'remaining', '360,000', 'hours', 'would', 'still', 'remain', 'pretty', 'daunting', 'task', 'consider', 'Zoe', 'chip', 'organic', 'nature', 'Could', 'use', 'chemical', 'neurological', 'electrical', 'precursors', 'highlight', 'moments', 'certain', 'emotions', 'stress', 'could', 'certainly', 'timecode', 'everything', '.3', 'Also', 'consider', 'relatives', 'are', 'consulted', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'editing', 'machine', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'running', 'searches', 'based', 'images', 'spoken', 'words.So', 'still', 'somewhat', 'far-fetched', 'think', 'movie', 'resonable', 'job', 'showing', 'somewhat', 'monumental', 'task', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'possible']",The Final Cut

Alan Hakman is so serious he makes Williams' Psychiatrist from ""Good Will Hunting"" look like Aladdin's Genie by comparison.  Mr. Williams has been acting in mainly serious roles for years, and he's good in this one.Besides his excellent, somber performance, this movie also has a clever idea going for it.  Folks can decide to have ""Zoe Implants"" put into their heads, and that chip digitally records their every vision and sound from birth to death.  After they die those ""home movies"" are edited by ""cutters"" to be shown at a post-humous ceremony called a ""Rememory"".The movie gets a little into the ethical dilemma such a technology would present, but not really into the legal implications.  Perhaps the screenwriter was thinking ""if a dead person has committed a crime, who really cares if evidence shows up because they're dead already?""  At any rate, there is some contemplation about things like ""doesn't everyone have something in their past they wouldn't want someone else to see?"" and ""if you know your every moment is being recorded, won't you act differently - in fact, won't everyone around you act differently?""  1 in 20 citizens have Zoe chips, we're told, and those who make use of them are relatively somber, presumably because the Zoe Memories are seen at memorial services for the deceased.  There are loud, protest-sign swinging activists who oppose the whole process, and it took about halfway through the movie before it was plain to me that the reason they're protesting it is because it removes a portion of free will, self-determination - whatever you want to call it.Alan Hakman is a gifted cutter editing a lifetime of recorded memories into a 2 hour home movie with just the happy parts.  He has gained a reputation for being able to watch things that disturbs other cutters, and make nice rememories for dead folks with dark secrets.James Caviezel plays a former cutter who is now a zealot for the radical movement against the Zoe chip.  When a high-profile Zoe lawyer dies the activists assume that he has some very dark secrets, and they offer Alan half a million bucks for his file, hoping to use his secret memories to sabotage the whole Zoe movement.The thriller part of the movie is a little less than thrilling and the whole memory chip idea isn't fully fleshed out, but as a character study of Robin Williams' character, the Zoe idea serves as a suitable platform.  As a child young Alan had a traumatic experience (the scene that opens the movie).  While viewing a memory he unexpectedly sees someone he assumed was dead.

Chips are placed in baby's brains and their entire life is recorded.  After they die, Hackman edits the best parts of their life for funeral viewing.  This interesting storyline brings out a lot of questions.  How long does it take a `cutter' to edit only the good stuff shown dealing with years and years of a person's life?  Not all of the people he handles are Saints and he witnesses crimes and immoral activity that must be eliminated from the final viewing.  Why is he not required to report these crimes?  There are also other `cutters' competing for his role as the ""best cutter"" available.  Williams plays his character as a depressed, sodden dolt with not much of a life.  I suppose that helps when you live your life through so many others.  The plot is full of holes and confusing in its presentation.

When a child is born, his/her parents can opt for a pricey implant, called a Zoe, which fits in the child's head and will record every second of the child's life right up to the moment of death.  Now this concept has a myriad of possibilities to alter society and the way that people can or dare to interact with each other.  However, director Naim chooses to avoid these wider psycho-social implications to focus on a standard thriller of industrial espionage.  This tightening of focus works since Naim wanted to entertain the viewer without morphing the film into a ""message"" medium that might have emerged as insufferably pedantic.  Robin Williams is Alan Hakman, whose job is to edit or ""cut"" a lifetime of memories into a handy movie-length summary suitable for viewing at funerals.  I was mildly surprised that no one in the movie seemed to find a use for such an implant.  Each person would be an infallible lie detector.  Juries would have no trouble assessing a defendant's guilt.  Hakman works under enormous pressure.  There are many protestors who violently oppose what he does on moral grounds.  The several vignettes that show these protestors reminded me of leftists who think nothing of violating the rights of others with curses and beatings to exercise their own rights of free expression.  Further, Hakman daily has to edit out the unsavory aspects of his deceased client, thus forcing him to see evil up close and personal, and then delete the offending scene only to have to go home to wrestle with his conscience.  Williams portrays Hakman as a tightly wound up individual who has his own demons of memory to contend with.  Mira Sorvino is his lover who cares for him but only just so far since his job erects a massive wall of social static that bars true intimacy.  Jim Caveziel is a former ""cutter"" who tries to strongarm Hakman into giving him access to a recorded memory that if exposed will topple the entire industry of re-memorizing.FINAL CUT uses a constant series of claustrophobic scenes that intensify the torment that is right there on the viewing screen of a recorded memory.  The technology involved does not seem that far fetched, but viewer interest does not lie in that.  We watch movies like FINAL CUT because it is full of quirky characters, none of whom is truly evil, but all of whom are torn in deciding what is right, not what is the path of least resistance.

That chip grows naturally with the child, and records every moment of his life. When a person with a Zoe chip dies, a ""cutter"" erases the bad memories in his chip, and makes a short film with the best ones, so the relatives of the deceased can hold a special ceremony called a ""rememory"".Alan (Robin Williams) is known as the best cutter. He specializes in overly difficult jobs, namely in making good films out of the Zoe chips of dishonest but very rich people. That is the reason why the widow of a very important man hires Alan to cut the rememory of her dead husband. The problem is, that man worked for the firm that invented the Zoe chip, and a radical group that opposes that technology wants to get hold of his chip to discredit the company.When Alan is contacted by the leader of that group, Fletcher (Jim Caviezel), his initial reaction is to step back and return the chip to the widow. Unfortunately, Alan cannot do that, as he needs something that can only be found in the dead man's Zoe chip.All in all, I think this is a very good first effort by Omar Naim, the director.

Burns,"[8, 20]","Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is so hilariously inept at every single turn, so stupid in nearly every conceit, so laughably mundane with every plot strand, that you can't help but stare at it for the entire time like a slow-motion 25-car-pileup. The Final Cut begins with a childhood flashback that reminded me of the stupid opening of Taking Lives (i.e. - not a good sign) and continues to look like the worst TV movie ever made despite the fact that its central conceit (despite tons of logic holes) is mildly interesting.Robin Williams returns to One Hour Photo/Insomnia territory as Alan Hakman, a man who makes his living editing memory chips pre-natally implanted in people (now deceased) that record every single moment of their lives - good and bad. A 'Cutter' takes key moments of the dead person's life, edits them into a 2-hour format, and then presents them at 'Rememory' ceremonies, kind of a futuristic memorial service. Now, nevermind the fact that it would be absolutely impossible to perform a service like this: as of writing this review, I have lived for 170,028.5 hours. Even if a MAC truck hit me today, an editing job on me would make Lawrence of Arabia look like a piece of cake. Not to mention that chips like these would be an invasion of privacy, would change the criminal justice system, and would cause irreparable psychological damage to the people who discover they have them.Now, forget the conceit's implausibility and it is some sort of a P.K.Dickian invention that branches out into a sort of philosophy. This, in and of itself, is interesting and the movie has a few moments directly involving the 'Guillotine' (Cutting device) that are intriguing. First-time writer/director Omar Naim isn't just happy with a shaky premise, though, so he layers the film with a dorky childhood flashback (unintentionally funny), an implausible love subplot (Mira Sorvino + Robin Williams = *shudder*), an antagonist who used to be a Cutter (Jim Caveizel...shut up and play Jesus), a kiddie-raper theme in one of the deceased's memories (maudlin), and some of the worst dialogue I've heard since Brad Pitt charged forth in Troy.The IMDB message boards are touting Naim as maybe the next Shyamalan, but this consistently horrible mess only serves to make Night's awful The Village look like Citizen Kane. The Final Cut exists only as a marketing experiment by Lion's Gate Films, really. It was projected on a DTDS DVD Player the entire time (yes, I'm not kidding; the movie doesn't even show in theaters on real 35-mm film) just to see if that new system would be lucrative. I have a chilly vision about the future - theaters might actually start using that. It is ugly, it has no aesthetic (then again, neither does the movie), and it shines a dim light on the future of the movies. Funny thing - this movie does the same for Robin Williams' career.

Donnelly ""Opera Meg""","[1, 2]","First off, anyone who doesn't think Robin Williams has what it takes for a somber, reserved dramatic performance that still delivers, please see ""Final Cut."" It's hard to believe this is the same frenetic personality that brought us Mork from Ork.Unfortunately, Williams is the only thing that's outstanding in this intriging, if lackluster morality tale. Alan Hakman (Williams) is a highly sought-after ""cutter"" who assembles the memories of the dead to present to their respective families a ""remorial"" with the help of a ZOE chip that records the person's life from the time he's born up to his final moments. Hakman has to wade through years of memories to edit together the perfect remorial, and this means sitting through days of footage. He's seen all the ugliness, benality and petty human cruelties there are through the eyes of his ""projects."" He's also traumitized by an event in his own past that makes it difficult for him to connect to the living, especially his confused but loving girlfriend, played very nicely by Mira Sorvino.Against the entire ZOE implant idea is former cutter Fletcher (Jim Caviezel) who wants to buy Hakman's latest project-ZOE founder Bannister-, and is determined at whatever cost to obtain it so that he can find something to scandalize the corporation and put it out of business. As Hakman begins to wade through Bannister's memories, he discovers an ugly secret about the dead man, as well as an unwelcome character from his own troubled past.The Final Cut does offer something to think about. Do we have the right to record others in our memories, and have those memories played out to anyone who wants them? What about expectation of privacy? Does the ZOE chip fundamentally alter human behavior for the better-not because of a want to be a good person-but because we'll be afraid someone will disover our sins in a future remorial?Like Memento, The Machinist, Insomnia, and even to some extent Total Recall, Final cut deals with the mystery of memory. How reliable is it? Do we remember things as they are, or as we wanted them to be? Can we be held prisoner by a guilt that should never exist, or let ourselves off the hook as it were by convieniently altering our memories?Well, Final Cut tries but doesn't answer any of these questions. Not even Hakman's motives for becoming a ""cutter"" are fully explained. And while the movie bills itself as a futuristic thriller, it just doesn't thrill. A few suspenseful moments are all we're treated to before the thing comes to a rather unsatisfying and hurried end.I recommend this movie, but for real futuristic thrillers, try Gattaca, Bladerunnder or 1942.",3,Interesting Idea-Fails in Followthrough,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,2648,"['First', 'off', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'think', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'what', 'somber', 'reserved', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'still', 'please', 'see', 'Final', 'Cut', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'frenetic', 'personality', 'brought', 'Mork', 'Ork.Unfortunately', 'Williams', 'only', 'thing', 'outstanding', 'intriging', 'lackluster', 'morality', 'tale', 'Alan', 'Hakman', 'Williams', 'highly', 'sought-after', 'cutter', 'who', 'memories', 'dead', 'present', 'respective', 'families', 'remorial', 'help', 'ZOE', 'chip', 'person', 'life', 'time', 'born', 'up', 'final', 'moments', 'Hakman', 'wade', 'years', 'memories', 'edit', 'together', 'perfect', 'remorial', 'sitting', 'days', 'footage', 'seen', 'ugliness', 'benality', 'petty', 'human', 'cruelties', 'are', 'eyes', 'projects', 'also', 'traumitized', 'event', 'own', 'past', 'difficult', 'connect', 'living', 'especially', 'confused', 'loving', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'very', 'nicely', 'Mira', 'Sorvino.Against', 'entire', 'ZOE', 'implant', 'idea', 'former', 'cutter', 'Fletcher', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'who', 'buy', 'Hakman', 'latest', 'project-ZOE', 'founder', 'Bannister-', 'determined', 'cost', 'obtain', 'so', 'can', 'find', 'something', 'scandalize', 'corporation', 'put', 'business', 'Hakman', 'wade', 'Bannister', 'memories', 'ugly', 'secret', 'dead', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'unwelcome', 'character', 'own', 'troubled', 'past.The', 'Final', 'Cut', 'offer', 'something', 'think', 'Do', 'have', 'right', 'record', 'others', 'memories', 'have', 'memories', 'played', 'out', 'anyone', 'who', 'What', 'expectation', 'privacy', 'ZOE', 'chip', 'fundamentally', 'alter', 'human', 'behavior', 'better-not', 'want', 'be', 'good', 'person-but', ""'ll"", 'be', 'afraid', 'someone', 'will', 'disover', 'sins', 'future', 'remorial', 'Memento', 'Machinist', 'Insomnia', 'even', 'extent', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Final', 'cut', 'deals', 'mystery', 'memory', 'How', 'reliable', 'Do', 'remember', 'things', 'are', 'wanted', 'be', 'Can', 'be', 'held', 'prisoner', 'guilt', 'should', 'never', 'exist', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'were', 'convieniently', 'altering', 'memories', 'Well', 'Final', 'Cut', 'tries', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'Not', 'even', 'Hakman', 'motives', 'becoming', 'cutter', 'are', 'fully', 'explained', 'movie', 'bills', 'futuristic', 'thriller', 'just', ""n't"", 'thrill', 'few', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'are', ""'re"", 'treated', 'thing', 'rather', 'unsatisfying', 'hurried', 'end.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'real', 'futuristic', 'thrillers', 'try', 'Gattaca', 'Bladerunnder', '1942']",The Final Cut

878733,A1A4BX7D2OY0D4,B00079HZOS,Michael Garcia,"[1, 2]","This movie seems all but forgotten nowadays.  I remember seeing it when it came out in the theaters.  Its seems little odd or different due to the storyline, but if you're into the &#34;serious&#34; roles that Robin Williams does, he turns in a good one in this movie.The plot is essentially that people can now have chips implanted in them at birth and what this chip does is record everything you hear and see and stores the memory so that when you die you can have all the &#34;bad&#34; or &#34;unnecessary&#34; parts removed and relatives can then view your memories on a screen near your tombstone.  Bizarre, right???  Not really though, because due to human's almost insatiable fascination with death and experience, such a technology might possibly be used this way.I would compare it to the 1900s and earlier when people would pay anything to anyone who would claim to speak to the dead.  Nowadays you can say that someone who offers that is just trying to rob you, but there is some sort of desire to have the dead live on, which this movie proposes.  Through editing one's memories, one can live on the way they wish to be remembered.  Edit out the bad parts and leave the good parts, something I think we all one metaphorically in our lives.Robin Williams plays Alan Hakman, a 'cutter' someone who is responsible for editing the memories.  He must approach his job without attachment and without bias, editing out the negative parts of his client's lives might involve witnessing the worst of their behavior, possibly even the bad deeds to another.  The story unfolds around a high profile client whose memories he in charge of editing.The movie has interesting scenes where we hear points about the ethics of this process and we see the anti-cutting movement that takes place in the movie.  There are groups who are in favor, who wish to have their relatives live on that way, and there are others with more of a 'stay in the present' attitude that rejects staying stuck in the past and rejects romanticizing people who might have otherwise not have been the best people.Jim Caviezel is in the movie and he plays a character the used to be a 'cutter' just like Williams, but got older and tired of the profession, moved on and sought to discredit it.  He shows up in the film early one, catching Williams attention, then demanding that he take over the high-profile client's chip, instead of Williams.  The rest is sort of a cat and mouse between Caviezel and Williams as we start to learn about William's background.The movie is overall interesting in the premise it presents and the good and bad about it.  The whole process gaves some consolation to people who otherwise move on with their lives; the bad side being that taking out the 'undesirable' parts of ones memory will make life appear more rosier than it actually is, you need the good and bad to truly understand or appreciate life.I gave the film 3 out of 5 stars here because I felt the story progressed and was entertaining, but it felt as though it could have been a little longer and it didn't seem like there was much of a payoff or emotional climax.  We are interested in William's character, but I didn't really sympathize for him.  Also, the scenes where he is being chased by Caviezel are as creative as the action-chase sequences in a movie that would be seen on Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Still, I would say give it a watch.",3,"Interesting movie and great performance from Williams, a little short and condensed for its potential",1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,3414,"['movie', 'forgotten', 'nowadays', 'remember', 'seeing', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'little', 'odd', 'different', 'due', 'storyline', ""'re"", '34', 'serious', '34', 'roles', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'good', 'one', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'essentially', 'people', 'can', 'now', 'have', 'chips', 'implanted', 'birth', 'what', 'chip', 'record', 'everything', 'hear', 'see', 'stores', 'memory', 'so', 'when', 'die', 'can', 'have', '34', 'bad', '34', '34', 'unnecessary', '34', 'parts', 'removed', 'relatives', 'can', 'then', 'view', 'memories', 'screen', 'tombstone', 'Bizarre', 'right', 'Not', 'really', 'due', 'human', 'almost', 'insatiable', 'fascination', 'death', 'experience', 'technology', 'might', 'possibly', 'be', 'used', 'way.I', 'would', 'compare', '1900s', 'earlier', 'when', 'people', 'would', 'pay', 'anything', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'claim', 'speak', 'dead', 'can', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'trying', 'rob', 'sort', 'desire', 'have', 'dead', 'live', 'movie', 'editing', 'one', 'memories', 'one', 'can', 'live', 'way', 'wish', 'be', 'remembered', 'Edit', 'out', 'bad', 'parts', 'leave', 'good', 'parts', 'something', 'think', 'one', 'metaphorically', 'lives.Robin', 'Williams', 'Alan', 'Hakman', ""'cutter"", 'someone', 'who', 'responsible', 'editing', 'memories', 'must', 'approach', 'job', 'attachment', 'bias', 'editing', 'out', 'negative', 'parts', 'client', 'lives', 'might', 'involve', 'witnessing', 'worst', 'behavior', 'possibly', 'even', 'bad', 'deeds', 'story', 'high', 'profile', 'client', 'memories', 'charge', 'editing.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'where', 'hear', 'points', 'ethics', 'process', 'see', 'anti-cutting', 'movement', 'place', 'movie', 'are', 'groups', 'who', 'are', 'favor', 'who', 'wish', 'have', 'relatives', 'live', 'way', 'are', 'others', 'more', ""'stay"", 'present', 'attitude', 'staying', 'stuck', 'past', 'romanticizing', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'otherwise', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'people.Jim', 'Caviezel', 'movie', 'character', 'used', 'be', ""'cutter"", 'just', 'Williams', 'got', 'older', 'tired', 'profession', 'moved', 'sought', 'discredit', 'up', 'film', 'early', 'one', 'catching', 'Williams', 'attention', 'then', 'demanding', 'take', 'over', 'high-profile', 'client', 'chip', 'instead', 'Williams', 'rest', 'sort', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Caviezel', 'Williams', 'start', 'learn', 'William', 'background.The', 'movie', 'overall', 'interesting', 'premise', 'good', 'bad', 'whole', 'process', 'consolation', 'people', 'who', 'otherwise', 'move', 'lives', 'bad', 'side', 'being', 'taking', 'out', ""'undesirable"", 'parts', 'ones', 'memory', 'will', 'make', 'life', 'more', 'rosier', 'actually', 'need', 'good', 'bad', 'truly', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'life.I', 'gave', 'film', '3', '5', 'stars', 'here', 'felt', 'story', 'progressed', 'was', 'entertaining', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'longer', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'there', 'was', 'much', 'payoff', 'emotional', 'climax', 'are', 'interested', 'William', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'sympathize', 'Also', 'scenes', 'where', 'being', 'chased', 'Caviezel', 'are', 'as', 'creative', 'action-chase', 'sequences', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'Still', 'would', 'say', 'give', 'watch']",The Final Cut

He can make a low life criminal look like a saint, and there is no job he will not take.  He is a sort of Sin Eater, taking all the bad events of a person's life upon himself.  He is somewhat antisocial, with a kind of-girlfriend named Della (Sorvino).  Their relationship suffers because of his dedication to his job, and while she is not happy, he seems somewhat content.Hackman is hired to do a Rememory for a wealthy man with a shady past.  His widow wants the Rememory to make him look good, and knows that he can do it based on his reputation.  Enter Fletcher (Caviezel), a former cutter who now is a leader of a group opposed to Remories.  He wants to take the rich man's Zoe implant and use it for his own purposes.  Hackman naturally refuses, and so begins a cat and mouse game to see who will end up with the implant.Finally, interspersed with the story is a memory from Hackman's childhood that may have shaped his career path and the person he is today.This is an interesting and entertaining movie.  Once again, Robin Williams shows that he is excellent in more serious roles.  Cabiezel is good as the bad guy, and Sorvino does her best with the small part that she has.

While working on a implant of a man named Charles Bannister, Williams finds someone within a piece of the footage, a friend of his when he was younger who fell accidently and who Williams as a kid, left there and Williams thought that the kid had died way back when but now seeing this, he doesnt think so. Meanwhile, a former cutter, named Fletcher played by Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Caviezel...sorry I mean Christ, The Thin Red Line), wants Bannister's implant for his own use because he thinks that when Williams cuts and edits, that he makes them like saints, not like the sinners they are. Plus, Williams' on/off girlfriend Delila, played by Mira Sorvino (Replacement Killers, Quiz Show), doesnt want to be with him when he cuts, she wants him to seperate that from their relationship.

He has been working to retrieve people's memories stored in a microchip which records events in life from birth until death. Yes, even masturbation is recorded. Along, with the pleasant events in life the non-so-pleasant events are also recorded. What is a ""cutter's"" job? Why he's to cut out the unpleasant parts of a person's life and show only the best and happy events. This means that a ""cutter"" sees everything a deceased person has done, yes even murders, rapes, and domestic violence is recorded. There are 3 rules of a ""cutter"" one of them being that you can not have an implant of your own for obvious reasons. You don't want to record the unpleasant parts of someone else's lives onto your own chip.Reminiscent of such movies as Memento, One-Hour Photo, and 8mm, the movie begins with Alan Hackman(Robin Williams) being 10 years old and showing you a tragedy that occurs when he is with a friend. This event haunts him for the rest of his life. At age 51, after years of built up guilt he proceeds to undergo a risky procedure which has him hooked up to a computer screen downloading images of his life while his is still alive and breathing. Here he goes back to the memories stored at age 10. Back to the time when he began to feel guilt for an incident that doesn't quite look as tragic when he takes a second look.During his time of guilt he is to ""cut"" a life of one of Eye Tech's lawyers, last named Bannister. Where it shows some potentially hurtful images that could put a stop to ""cutting"" or the implants all together. Jim Caveziel's character, the leader of the anti-EYE, anti-implants group decides to take matters into his own hands when Bannister's memories are accidentally destroyed by Hackman's girlfriend(Mira Sorvino).

But the beauty of futurism is where you take an idea and really explore one or two of its implications (as Code 46 or Blade Runner did) in human context. This movie just names implications that, apparently, no one has ever though of in the future. You want to know what this movie will be?  Get out a napkin and jot down ten super obvious implications of the premise:  that funerals will involve a movie edited from a video implant in people's brains that recorded everything they ever saw.  Then make ten scenes where Robin Williams walks around wooden and morose, and then someone pops into a scene and says, ""Don't you see?  Everyone is ignoring..."" and fill in one from your napkin.  Then roll credits.  For example, Robin Williams was the editor for his girlfriend's (Mira Sorvino's) ex boyfriend's eulogy/video:  guess what surprise realization on her part that might lead to, but not until the end?  The script is pure cliche and seems to have been written by an 8th grader who expects us to be impressed with the obvious.  (For example, the main character, a ""cutter,"" happens to have the last name ""Hakman."") Good actors are reduced to stagey utterances of the cliches.  Even with the cool premise, the only ""profound"" thing the script says about these movies is that the editors cut out the rapes and child molestations that people do, and just leave cutesy scenes of childhood birthday parties where the person says, ""I want to grow up to help people.""  A little too black and white.  And that's all that makes Robin Williams ""the best cutter"" in all the land:  that he ""deletes"" wife-beating and keeps the Hallmark card stuff?

878743,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00079HZOS,Only-A-Child,"[2, 3]","In six words: great idea-not so great execution. In a slightly vague future, Robin Williams plays a video editor named Alan, his job is assembling 1-2 hour video portraits of deceased clients whose parent's were well off enough to have had them fitted (while still in the womb) with a ""Zoe"" implant. Named after the corporation that initially developed this device, the implant records (24-7) everything that happens to a person during their lifetime. It is important to the story that viewers understand that these are not memories but actual recordings. This distinction is critical to the plot as well as to one of the interesting questions posed by the film; to what extent have our actual memories been distorted by time.The editors (called cutters) must distill down this lifetime of footage into a brief highlights video, discretely deleting scenes that would be offensive to the family of the decreased. This is not that different than the writers of obituary notices (see ""Closer""). The video is shown at a special memorial service called a ""rememory"". To add some unnecessary complexity to the story there is a violent protest group who object to the whole concept. The basis of their objection is never adequately explained but seems to be centered on the fact that the footage is by necessity all from the person's own ""point-of-view"", with the protesters chanting ""remember for yourself"".Of course a Cutter sees everything (mostly in fast motion) making him or her privy to a person's every secret and sin. In the film they briefly raise the most interesting question posed by this whole idea, if you knew that someone (be it man or God) would replay your entire life, to what extent would it change your behavior? In the film most (but not all) people with the implant are aware that they have it.Knowing all this stuff makes Alan a lonely man. His philosophy: ""The dead mean nothing to me, I took this job out of respect for the living"", has caused him to avoid close interpersonal relationships, which might compromise the many confidences he is keeping. Within the closed community of cutters he is known as a ""Sin Eater"" because of his willingness to sanitize the lives of the scum of the earth, accepting clients that the other cutters reject. Williams looks even sadder and more depressed than in did in ""What Dreams May Come"". It is a extremely restrained performance, not especially challenging but perfectly suited to the mood of this film.Alan gets in trouble when he takes on a project for a rich widow (Stephanie Romanov). Her husband knew a lot of corporate secrets and had been playing around with their young daughter. This assignment means that Alan is suddenly very important to a lot of very powerful people who have a lot to gain by learning certain information that only he knows.  So the film begins to go in the direction of those ""messing around with something much bigger than you are"" stories, it starts to have an episodic Raymond Chandler feel to it, and this fits nicely with what might be called a futuristic film noir production design.Overall the many interesting ethical and philosophical questions raised by ""The Final Cut"" are more interesting than the film itself. In fact, there is so little real suspense and character identification that the viewing process is mostly an exercise in pulling yourself back from your contemplation of earlier scenes so that you can follow what is happening on the screen.The film goes wrong by introducing a parallel story about Alan's childhood. While well handled, it fails in its purpose of explaining his adult motivations. By the end we care nothing about his character or his actions and are back to day dreaming about the many issues the film raises but does not adequately address.Then again, what do I know?

He is somewhat controversial because, as a cutter, his specialty is taking really nasty, despicable people and making them look normal.  Cutters are not allowed to create footage, not allowed to mix footage from two individuals, and are not allowed to have the Zoe Implant themselves (which would record other peoples' memories).He starts working on a lawyer for Eye Tech, the company that makes the Zoe Implant, and discovers that he sexually abused his daughter.  Anti-implant protest groups want to use this footage to bring down Eye Tech.  He is adamant about protecting his client and burying the incident -- but not entirely comfortable with it either.  A struggle ensues, during which the late lawyer's memory chip is destroyed.  Everybody thinks, fine, story over.But Robin's character, Alan Hakman (great name for a cutter!) discovers he has an implant himself, unbeknowst to him (his parent died before telling him).  Suddenly the bad guys want to kill him, to get his implant and download his memories of the lawyer's abuse.  Mayhem ensues.It was pretty good, an interesting premise, kinda a cross between Minority Report and all those memory movies like Spotless Mind, Total Recall, et al.  Robin Williams does well as a very taciturn, humorless employee (not unlike his performance in One Hour Photo).  The best part of the movie is the production design -- everything is kinda 21st century retro, with lots of wood and expensive fabrics.  Even the computer cases are carved from wood!  It makes an odd balance between future-tech and 19th century opulence -- very believable.  Great musical score, all done with orchestra (another retro touch).Bad points: A few of the technical details aren't fully worked out -- the lawyer remembers being born, for instance (when did they have time to install the implant?)  The idea that having an implant (only 1 in 20 people do) makes you live your life differently, knowing somebody will be reviewing everything you did, is touched on but never really explored fully.

Such a chip would impact society in other ways -you certainly couldn't casually murder somebody with the Zoe chip.But writer/director Omar Naim's film focuses on that oddity of the modern funeral, where the dead guy had a mother sometime, and therefore is a saint. Robin Williams plays Alan Hakman, a ""cutter"" for hire who edits years of Zoe film into the highlights of a person's life. A cutter apparently takes some oath to erase and ignore the uglier details in the film.And if that includes murder? Or, in this movie, molestation? If a young girl's been abused, is it not anybody's duty to get the girl help, whether the abuser is deceased or not?Naim's script addresses those issues - he introduces a group of presumably Christian protestors (led by Jim ""Jesus"" Caviezel) who want one of Hakman's jobs to expose the crimes of a Zoe employee - but it never really follows through, instead reliving some trauma from Hakman's childhood and developing a weak romantic subplot with a bookstore clerk (Mira Sorvino).The script focuses elsewhere because the science truly is fiction - in a real world, laws would bind up a cutter's job with so much red tape and formal reporting that loved ones would find out, whether they wanted to or not, the sins of those they loved.

Now I would like to correct the running time for this movie, the disc is reporting that this movie is 105 minutes along, and the end credits starts at 90 minutes, so I was thinking that there was going to be 15 minutes of end credits, but this movie is really 94 minutes long, and not 1 hour and 45 minutes, as the disc is reporting, so this movie has to be one of the few movies that is shorter then the disc/dvd is reporting.",4,One of the strangest Robin Williams movies ever!,1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,1398,"['movie', 'be', 'strangest', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'movies', 'must', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'character', 'Williams', 'got', 'strangest', 'job', 'doing', 'lot', 'people', 'hear', 'so', 'do', 'movie', 'getting', '3', 'stars', 'here', 'be', 'quite', 'rare', 'movie', 'young', 'Alan', 'Casey', 'Dubois', 'young', 'Louis', 'Liam', 'Ranger', 'town', 'parents', 'are', 'visiting', 'day', 'Louis', 'do', 'fatal', 'stunt', 'area', 'incient', 'never', 'anybody', 'what', 'say', 'Now', 'Alan', 'Hakman', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'now', 'cutter', 'where', 'film', 'person', 'life', 'video', 'family', 'members', 'keep', 'when', 'thier', 'loved', 'one', 'passed', 'away', 'soon', 'up', 'project', 'man', 'had', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'widow', 'Stephanie', 'Romanov', 'Alan', 'Rememory', 'even', 'think', 'late', 'husband', 'was', 'molster', 'even', 'did', 'daughter', 'Now', 'would', 'like', 'correct', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'disc', 'reporting', 'movie', '105', 'minutes', 'along', 'end', 'starts', '90', 'minutes', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', '15', 'minutes', 'end', 'credits', 'movie', 'really', '94', 'minutes', 'long', 'not', '1', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'disc', 'reporting', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'shorter', 'then', 'disc/dvd', 'reporting']",The Final Cut

878762,A1DQZBHEU98PBT,B00079HZOS,Theresa W,"[0, 0]","One thing I came away with after watching this movie is that the concept was very original!  Unless there are similar thoughts or films I'm not aware of, I'd say for most people this movie subject will fascenate you.  To the point you'll forgive some of it's minor flaws.Taking place at some point in the near future, Final Cut features something called the ""zoe implant"".  A zoe implant is something you can buy for a child, before they are even born, and have it implanted in their skull.  The purpose?  To record and document every single moment and encounter of their life!  The implants are then used after a person dies, to create a memorial for them, but editing through all of the footage to try and ""sum up"" someone's life and experiences.  A cutter is someone whose job it is to go through the data and pick and choose what scenes from the life to use.  Robin Williams is a cutter, and it's him we watch through out the movie, as he struggles to piece together lives, and happens to stumble across a secret in his own life to explore.The interesting theory brought into this movie is how controversial something like this would be.  At first, we might find something like this invaluable and irreplaceable, as far as capturing memories.  However, shown in the movie, some people would find this implant a violation of their privacy, as well as at the end of someones life it can be used to manipulate the end product to the satisfaction of the cutter and/or family.I really did find the movie fascenating.  I was also pleased with the actors.  Robin Williams does a great job as always.  However, I did feel the movie ended a bit abruptly.  I also felt like at times there wasn't enough explanation for what was driving William's character (specifically, a memory in his past).  I wish the movie would have been a bit longer, but, I'd rather a movie be short and enjoyable than long and drawn out!  I'd recommend this movie to anyone looking for something new and different.",4,Original Film,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,1984,"['One', 'thing', 'came', 'away', 'watching', 'movie', 'concept', 'was', 'very', 'original', 'are', 'similar', 'thoughts', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'aware', ""'d"", 'say', 'most', 'people', 'movie', 'subject', 'will', 'fascenate', 'point', ""'ll"", 'forgive', 'minor', 'flaws.Taking', 'place', 'point', 'near', 'future', 'Final', 'Cut', 'something', 'called', 'zoe', 'implant', 'zoe', 'implant', 'something', 'can', 'buy', 'child', 'are', 'even', 'born', 'have', 'implanted', 'skull', 'purpose', 'record', 'document', 'single', 'moment', 'encounter', 'life', 'implants', 'are', 'then', 'used', 'person', 'create', 'memorial', 'editing', 'footage', 'try', 'sum', 'up', 'someone', 'life', 'experiences', 'cutter', 'someone', 'job', 'go', 'data', 'pick', 'choose', 'what', 'scenes', 'life', 'use', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'cutter', 'watch', 'movie', 'piece', 'together', 'lives', 'stumble', 'secret', 'own', 'life', 'explore.The', 'interesting', 'theory', 'brought', 'movie', 'how', 'controversial', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'might', 'find', 'something', 'invaluable', 'irreplaceable', 'as', 'far', 'capturing', 'memories', 'However', 'shown', 'movie', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'implant', 'violation', 'privacy', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'someones', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'manipulate', 'end', 'product', 'satisfaction', 'cutter', 'and/or', 'family.I', 'really', 'did', 'find', 'movie', 'fascenating', 'was', 'also', 'pleased', 'actors', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'great', 'job', 'always', 'However', 'did', 'feel', 'movie', 'ended', 'bit', 'abruptly', 'also', 'felt', 'times', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'explanation', 'what', 'was', 'driving', 'William', 'character', 'specifically', 'memory', 'past', 'wish', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'longer', ""'d"", 'rather', 'movie', 'be', 'short', 'enjoyable', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'different']",The Final Cut

Were it not for three stars Robin Williams, Mira Sorvino, and Jim Caviezel, `The Final Cut' would be just another barely acceptable Sci-fi film that you might find in the rental video shop nearby among other B-thrillers. The first-time director Omar Naim has good visual sense, but his script, though based on an intriguing idea, ends up with an unfulfilled promise that has so many holes and flaws.The film is set in near future. Robin Williams plays Alan, an able `cutter' who can edit and present the memories of the deceased people from the images pre-recorded in their brains. Alan takes out only the best moments of their life, seen from the POV of the dead, and shows the edited footage at the memorial. That is called `Rememory' and Alan does it interviewing people with businessman-like attitude, and standing during the ceremony like a well-mannered mortician.But some are opposed to this popular ceremony, and Jim Caviezel's character, former cutter Fletcher is one of them. One day Fletcher shows up before Alan, and threatens Alan to give him the tip that was implanted in one corrupt lawyer.[LOOKS GOOD, BUT LACKS AUTHENTICITY] Though some audiences might find the premises of `The Final Cut' interesting, most fans of the genre will be reminded of many similar films and novels (like P. K. Dick) made about the memories of humans. I don't particularly mind seeing someone barrowing ideas, but the lack authenticity is another thing. If you don't mind, please answer the following questions:A) Do you really want to see the beautified and whitewashed `re-memory' of someone who grows up to be a wife-beating brute, and shed a tear at his funeral (especially when you're his wife)?B) Do you really think that you can implant a memory tip (it is organic, they say) in the brains of the unborn baby?C) If such a spectacular technique is really possible, how can you think of stealing the `images' from the cutter, and making use of them as proof of some crimes when you know (and we definitely know) that these images can be easily faked?If all your answers to the three questions above are yes, `The Final Cut' is a film for you. To me, the film has never a ring of truth from the very first, the badly edited childhood memory part that tries to explain the trauma of the protagonist. And the very bland acting from the three main actors is also disappointing, especially Mira Sorvino, who is terribly miscast as a possible sweetheart of Robin William's character.But yes, I know, after all any film requires a leap of faith in the materials it deals with. I thought, however, `The Final Cut' requited too much of it - not about the ideas themselves, but the way how they are used.",2,"That Doesn't Cut it: Good Visuals, Nice Ideas, But Lacks the Edge",1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,2760,"['Two', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Films', 'something', ""n't"", 'Were', 'not', 'three', 'stars', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Final', 'Cut', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'barely', 'acceptable', 'Sci-fi', 'film', 'might', 'find', 'rental', 'video', 'shop', 'nearby', 'other', 'B-thrillers', 'first-time', 'director', 'Omar', 'Naim', 'good', 'visual', 'sense', 'script', 'though', 'based', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'up', 'unfulfilled', 'promise', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'flaws.The', 'film', 'set', 'near', 'future', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Alan', 'able', 'cutter', 'who', 'can', 'edit', 'present', 'memories', 'deceased', 'people', 'images', 'pre-recorded', 'brains', 'Alan', 'out', 'only', 'best', 'moments', 'life', 'seen', 'POV', 'dead', 'edited', 'footage', 'memorial', 'called', 'Rememory', 'Alan', 'interviewing', 'people', 'businessman-like', 'attitude', 'standing', 'ceremony', 'well-mannered', 'mortician.But', 'are', 'opposed', 'popular', 'ceremony', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'character', 'former', 'cutter', 'Fletcher', 'one', 'One', 'day', 'Fletcher', 'up', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'give', 'tip', 'was', 'implanted', 'one', 'corrupt', 'lawyer', '[', 'LOOKS', 'GOOD', 'BUT', 'LACKS', 'AUTHENTICITY', ']', 'Though', 'audiences', 'might', 'find', 'premises', 'Final', 'Cut', 'interesting', 'most', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'be', 'reminded', 'many', 'similar', 'films', 'novels', 'P.', 'K.', 'Dick', 'made', 'memories', 'humans', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'mind', 'seeing', 'someone', 'barrowing', 'ideas', 'lack', 'authenticity', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'please', 'answer', 'following', 'questions', 'Do', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'beautified', 'whitewashed', 're-memory', ""'"", 'someone', 'who', 'up', 'be', 'wife-beating', 'brute', 'shed', 'tear', 'funeral', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'wife', 'B', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'can', 'implant', 'memory', 'tip', 'organic', 'say', 'brains', 'unborn', 'baby', 'C', 'spectacular', 'technique', 'really', 'possible', 'how', 'can', 'think', 'stealing', 'images', 'cutter', 'making', 'use', 'proof', 'crimes', 'when', 'know', 'definitely', 'know', 'images', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'faked', 'answers', 'three', 'questions', 'are', 'yes', 'Final', 'Cut', 'film', 'film', 'never', 'ring', 'truth', 'very', 'first', 'badly', 'edited', 'childhood', 'memory', 'part', 'explain', 'trauma', 'protagonist', 'very', 'bland', 'acting', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'also', 'disappointing', 'especially', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'who', 'terribly', 'miscast', 'possible', 'sweetheart', 'Robin', 'William', 'character.But', 'yes', 'know', 'film', 'leap', 'faith', 'materials', 'thought', 'however', 'Final', 'Cut', 'requited', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'ideas', 'way', 'how', 'are', 'used']",The Final Cut
