279171,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6301967674,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 30]","I am not afraid to stand on my little soapbox and say that typically I find that originals are enormously better than any remake could ever dream to be.  When creating a remake, one can never seem to find that perfect balance that was found in the original.  The characters, the unique situations, and the overall charm seem to be thrown out the window in luau of big box office names, CGI, and overdrawn clich&eacute;s.  We all complain about them when we leave the theater and snicker when we see it.  Well, I am here to say that finally, I have been proved wrong.  The 1950s version of Father of the Bride was a far inferior version to the recent Steve Martin remake.  Yes, you have heard it here first, but the Spencer Tracy/Elizabeth Taylor version lacked the humor, wit, and realism of insanity that the remake had.  Tracy seemed like a distant father, not caring much about his actual daughter, but more about the expense of the wedding.  Joan Bennett was nothing more than an emotionless cardboard wife that seemed to be harboring a disturbing hatred towards her present life.  Elizabeth Taylor was a rich snob that was used to draw in audiences by using the classic ""eye candy"" trick.  The story, the characters, the actors, the ""dated"" sensation of this film only confused me further on how this version of Father of the Bride could ever be considered a ""classic"".I do not want to use this forum to compare this version to the Steve Martin version, but there were obvious problems with this film from the beginning.  The complete lack of excitement from either parent when Taylor announces that she is getting married (and did anyone find that scene entirely random?) shocked me.  Even though we live in a completely different era, shouldn't there have been at least some reaction from Bennett and Tracy?  Tracy tried hard to convey the idea that he was worried about loosing his ""little girl"", but what I witnessed instead was an issue of money.  You could read in Steve Martin's eyes that he loved his little girl, and his focus was making sure that she wasn't marrying the wrong man.  This older version of Father of the Bride has a central theme that revolves around money.  Everything that happens in this film eventually leads back to Tracy complaining about how much money they are spending.  I was surprised because I wanted to see Tracy react to who Taylor was marrying, not how much he had to spend to make her happy.  It seemed to debunk the entire film and place this negative image on the entire marriage/event.  The scene where Tracy asks Taylor to just run away and get married for $1200 was idiotic.  This only solidified the randomness of the film and how Tracy had trouble grasping the true meaning of the picture.When the centralized theme is completely destroyed, one can only guess that a domino effect will occur which will hurt other avenues of this film.  That is why the acting was so atrocious.  Tracy showed no emotion about his daughter getting married.  From the moment she informs the family of her decision until the final anti-climax climax when he shuffles around to find her, he never really opens himself up to her.  That is what I needed to see between Tracy and Taylor, one of those father/daughter-bonding moments.  Director Minnelli tried with the ""late night snack"" scene later in the film, but by that point I had lost it with Tracy.  The same can be said for Joan Bennett, who literally went through every scene without a smile or a hint of emotion.  I felt as if Tracy and Bennett were the epitome of a waspy family whose main concern was money instead of emotion.  Could we get some passion into anyone in this film?  Hugging seemed to be the most valued way of demonstrating love, and while I realize that cinema was different then, did it have to be so unrealistic?  I hated Tracy and Bennett's portrayal of husband and wife, which eventually turned me away from ever seeing them as an actual family, which only hurt this film further.Finally, I would like to say that there was one scene that I did enjoy and if the entire film would have had the same creativity then perhaps it could have redeemed itself.  I loved the dream sequence that Tracy had about walking down the isle.  I though that it was reminiscent of director Tim Burton's early work.  The black and white stripes gobbling up Tracy was perhaps a bit of an excited moment for me because it was something I was hoping for.  Some evil floor devouring this mismatched actor.  Alas, it was only a dream, but can't we all dream?  There was more scenes like this needed to really demonstrate the fears (outside of monetary issues) of loosing a daughter and the insanity of a marriage.  There wasn't, which again, hurt this film further.Overall, I didn't enjoy this film as much as I was hoping.  I had always heard that this was a better version than the remake with Steve Martin, but upon watching it I found out it was not.  This was a very unemotional, unapologetic look at the financial side of getting married.  Tracy cared more about the dollar amount that he was spending instead of the interest of his own daughter.  It was pathetic.  There were a total of two decent scenes in the entire film (Tracy getting eaten by the floor and when he gets plowed at the in-law's house), but outside of that it was nothing but shambles.  It hurt to watch this film because you knew it could have been better.  With physical comedy, better actors, and a stronger emphasis on the true themes of the film, Father of the Bride may have been a winner.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Listen!

279174,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301967674,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","`Father of the Bride' is a film to warm your heart, a beautiful tale of fatherly affections and the bond that is formed, at times silently, between a father and his daughter.  There aren't many father/daughter films, the majority of the father films made have to deal with the bond between a father and his son, so it is nice to see a film like `Father of the Bride'.  Where Steve Martin's 1991 remake of this classic was far more centered on the comedic aspects, going the slapstick route in parts, this 1950 original is far more reserved and ultimately far more rewarding.For those of you not familiar with the plot, `Father of the Bride' (as if the title was self-explanatory) tells the story of Stanley Banks.  Stanley opens the film slumped over in a chair, broken glass and debris on the floor, and he proceeds to recite a monologue about weddings.  You see, Stanley has just endured his daughter's wedding, and he is about to relay to you the events that led up to that fateful day.  Stanley has two boys, but he only has one daughter; Kay.  Kay is young and charming and beautiful.  Kay is in love, with Buckley Dunstan, a boy whom Stanley is unaware of.  Stanley isn't keen on the idea of his precious little girl getting married, but soon he corralled into planning the extravagant wedding he didn't want while his wife goes a little crazy with the idea.  As the day looms over his head, he begins to warm to the idea, if only to see his daughter truly happy.And then he has to back away from the bride and take his seat next to his wife.UGH.I was not expecting the sublime quality of this film.  I mean, I like the 1991 remake and all, but it isn't even in the same caliber as this Vincente Minnelli charmer.  The tones here are far more subtle and the humor is allowed to sneak up on you.  It hits you in all the right ways, giving you an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia; as if their life were a beautiful mirror into your own.  The scenes are set up with a splendid crispness, and the performances are uniformly superb.  Elizabeth Taylor was the image of perfection; an iconic beauty (one of the most beautiful human beings ever created) and she shines with such delicious purity.  For an actress wholly confident in her sexuality, Taylor tones things down to create a young girl filled with bridled innocence.  Joan Bennett is just outstanding was Ellie, Kay's mother.  Her stares alone are comedic genius (the drunk scene, at the Dunstan's home...priceless), but she also has moments of such tender emotion, like when she confides in her husband her shattered dreams of a lavish wedding.  But, this film is all about Spencer Tracy; one of the finest actors to ever grace the big screen.  His paternal naturalness is so tender and endearing, and his eyes, the way they `take in' a scene, he's just spellbinding.  Every movement he makes is grounded in an authenticity; etching out for us a man who is an `every-man'.  His concern for his daughter's happiness and the pain in his heart for the loss of her innocence is breathtakingly sincere.You can feel him.At the end of the day, `Father of the Bride' is a treasure.  This is one to make a grown man cry (it happened), especially if you have that little wonder in your life that you dread `giving away'.",5,"Sons are sons until they get wives, but daughters are daughters all of their lives...",1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,3270,"['Father', 'Bride', 'film', 'warm', 'heart', 'beautiful', 'tale', 'fatherly', 'affections', 'bond', 'formed', 'times', 'silently', 'father', 'daughter', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'father/daughter', 'films', 'majority', 'father', 'films', 'made', 'have', 'deal', 'bond', 'father', 'son', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'Father', 'Bride', 'Where', 'Steve', 'Martin', '1991', 'remake', 'classic', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'centered', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'going', 'slapstick', 'route', 'parts', '1950', 'original', 'far', 'more', 'reserved', 'ultimately', 'far', 'more', 'rewarding.For', 'not', 'familiar', 'plot', 'Father', 'Bride', 'title', 'was', 'self-explanatory', 'story', 'Stanley', 'Banks', 'Stanley', 'film', 'slumped', 'chair', 'broken', 'glass', 'debris', 'floor', 'recite', 'monologue', 'weddings', 'see', 'Stanley', 'just', 'endured', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'relay', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'fateful', 'day', 'Stanley', 'two', 'boys', 'only', 'one', 'daughter', 'Kay', 'Kay', 'young', 'charming', 'beautiful', 'Kay', 'love', 'Buckley', 'Dunstan', 'boy', 'whom', 'Stanley', 'unaware', 'Stanley', ""n't"", 'keen', 'idea', 'precious', 'little', 'girl', 'getting', 'married', 'soon', 'corralled', 'planning', 'extravagant', 'wedding', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'wife', 'little', 'crazy', 'idea', 'day', 'head', 'warm', 'idea', 'only', 'see', 'daughter', 'truly', 'happy.And', 'then', 'back', 'away', 'bride', 'take', 'seat', 'wife.UGH.I', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'sublime', 'quality', 'film', 'mean', 'like', '1991', 'remake', ""n't"", 'even', 'same', 'caliber', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'charmer', 'tones', 'here', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'subtle', 'humor', 'allowed', 'sneak', 'up', 'right', 'ways', 'giving', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'nostalgia', 'life', 'were', 'beautiful', 'mirror', 'own', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'splendid', 'crispness', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'was', 'image', 'perfection', 'iconic', 'beauty', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'human', 'beings', 'ever', 'created', 'such', 'delicious', 'purity', 'actress', 'wholly', 'confident', 'sexuality', 'Taylor', 'things', 'down', 'create', 'young', 'girl', 'filled', 'bridled', 'innocence', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'just', 'outstanding', 'was', 'Ellie', 'Kay', 'mother', 'stares', 'alone', 'are', 'comedic', 'genius', 'drunk', 'scene', 'Dunstan', 'home', 'priceless', 'also', 'moments', 'such', 'tender', 'emotion', 'when', 'husband', 'shattered', 'dreams', 'lavish', 'wedding', 'film', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'ever', 'grace', 'big', 'screen', 'paternal', 'naturalness', 'so', 'tender', 'endearing', 'eyes', 'way', 'take', 'scene', 'just', 'spellbinding', 'movement', 'grounded', 'authenticity', 'etching', 'out', 'man', 'who', 'every-man', 'concern', 'daughter', 'happiness', 'pain', 'heart', 'loss', 'innocence', 'breathtakingly', 'sincere.You', 'can', 'feel', 'him.At', 'end', 'day', 'Father', 'Bride', 'treasure', 'one', 'make', 'grown', 'man', 'cry', 'happened', 'especially', 'have', 'little', 'wonder', 'life', 'dread', 'giving', 'away']",N/A

279180,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6301967674,Craig Connell,"[1, 2]","For those who like a light comedy diversion, this was pretty good stuff. Spencer Tracy is excellent as a ""father of the bride"" and he gives us a good idea of what it's like to have a daughter married off. Of course, Hollywood exaggerates a bit, and not everyone's daughter looks like Elizabeth Taylor, but that's what made this fun and, I think, a hit movie.A re-make  was done 40 years later, starring Steve Martin. I watched both versions and would select this one over the re-make. As in most cases, there were more values and family togetherness in the classic-era movies than what Hollywood usually shows today. Nothing against Martin, but it was too difficult trying to top Tracy's performance in here.This version actually was honored quite a bit, up for a handful of Academy Awards including ""Best Picture."" I don't remember this movie being THAT good, but everyone's sense of humor is different. Not being a father it was hard for me to relate to the mom and dad's predicaments here. Tracy and Joan Bennett played the parents. However, married friends of mine who saw this movie all loved it.Obviously, some of this is very dated and a little unrealistic.

279191,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6301967674,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 6]","At some point since the dawning of the age of home videos, we all must have experienced what you might call ""filmus interruptus.""  Movies, almost by definition, were meant to be watched from start to finish, over a span of about two hours (with plenty of exceptions).  They were never designed to be ""put down"" like a book or viewed episodically, like a TV series.But in our busy and eminently interruptible daily lives,  it's not uncommon to view a single movie over the course of two or three sittings.  And it's sometimes surprising how different a take you wind up having on the same film after as little as a twenty-four layover.Something like that happened to me recently when I started watching Vincente Minnelli's original FATHER OF THE BRIDE.  I was sleepy when I started to watch the film on a Friday evening and never expected to be able to watch it to the end.  Watching the first hour or so,  I found it as witty and charming as I'd expected.  Like Minnelli's classic musical MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, it was a gently mocking valentine to American family life--with human foibles not merely tolerated but actually embraced.  FATHER OF THE BRIDE, in fact, could be viewed as a kind of 1950s update on the earlier film's  major themes:  the durability and value of hearth and home over all else.  Fathers might see themselves as benign despots, but clever wives and daughters always knew how to wrap the ""head of the household"" around their little fingers.  Social conventions and rituals, especially those surrounding courtship, might be portrayed as somewhat silly, but ultimately harmless.  Or maybe even essential--they just may be the glue that holds society together after all.That this movie's themes reflect (and reinforce) Post-War all-American values is no surprise.  One can watch this film with a bit of nostalgia for an era in which a father's biggest worry on learning of his daughter's impending marriage is whether or not the girl's fianc&eacute; will ever be able to ""feed her.""  (And please, no Joan Rivers type jokes about that being a legit concern, given that the daughter in question was played by Liz Taylor).We have indeed come a long way since then.  Almost sixty years on, middle class marriage is a whole `nother institution, more the merger of two career paths than the joining of ""man and wife.""  Not surprisingly, a lot of people miss those ""good old days.""But the dark side of 1950s suburban life and love has also been successfully portrayed by filmmakers with a less benign vision and a more critical eye.  And it just so happened that I between watching ""part 1"" and ""part 2"" of FATHER, I caught (well, re-watched, actually)  Todd Haynes' devastating take on a similar theme (and--significantly--also set in the 1950s),the powerhouse melodrama FAR FROM PARADISE, which with its themes of racial tension and sexual conflict laid bare the underside of 1950s conventionality.When I went home and innocently starting up FATHER OF THE BRIDE again,  I found I almost couldn't bear watching it.  A feeling of claustrophobia suddenly crept in that was as surprising as it was discomfiting.  Perhaps it had something to do with my picking up the film with Spencer Tracy's genuinely disturbing dream sequence (a hallmark of nearly every Vincente Minnelli film, I'm told).  Problem was,  Tracy's Stanley Banks character wakes up from the dream to find himself psychically renewed and quite prepared now to deal with the minor hassles and frustrations of the actual wedding. In my newly skeptical frame of mind, I wasn't feeling so tolerant: suddenly, it all seemed like a big lie.  This is not how people really live their lives--and never was.Flash forward yet another twenty four hours later, and I find I'm feeling much more charitable towards the film.  Yes, there were at least two sides to the 1950s, and, yes, I've known that for years.  It doesn't make FATHER OF THE BRIDE any the less  witty or warm.  Was the world more innocent then?  Or was it striving to be more innocent than it could ever really be (especially after the horrors of the WWII).  Is there more implicit criticism in this bit of escapist fare than first meets the eye?  I'm not sure what might have been the filmmakers' intentions (although it certainly is interesting that Minnelli himself was married four times and has been ""outed"" as gay or bisexual in more than one bio of his most famous partner, Judy Garland).  Escapist works implicity suggest that there is something to escape FROM.  True enough.  But under most circumstances, I probably would have just succumbed to the film's considerable charms.  Let's be fair: when it came to escapist fare, no one did it better than Vincente Minnelli.",4,A Marriage Made In Hollywood,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,4708,"['point', 'dawning', 'age', 'home',

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[39, 43]","I just saw for the first time ever this movie made in 1950; directed by Vincente Minnelli; and starring Elizabeth Taylor, Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett. Ms. Taylor was only 18 when she made this film and was frightening and eternally beautiful. She is so petite that she almost could adorn her own wedding cake. The movie, however, as the title implies, belongs to Mr. Tracy who plays  her father who cannot bear to see his little daughter grow up and get married.  There is a lot of most fathers in Mr. Tracy's character.

Tracy is excellent  in a role that moves between being the voice of reason to being the voice  that stirs up more trouble.  He's very funny and his natural acting style  makes him the perfect everyman / typical father.  Joan Bennett stars as his  wife, in her glory planning the wedding she never had, and she's very good.  An incredibly beautiful Elizabeth Taylor is the bride, and it seems very  ironic watching her in a movie about weddings!

279201,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,6301967674,K. Boullosa,"[2, 6]","This piece of 1950s froth is expertly served up by Vincent Minnelli, Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, Elizabeth Taylor, and a wonderful supporting cast that includes Billie Burke, Moroni Olsen, and Leo G. Carroll, the latter doing a priceless turn as a supercilious wedding caterer.The film is as interesting as a record of the values of the times, as it is for the masterful performance by Spencer Tracy, who manages to make something out of what is, essentially, nothing. Well, that's what froth is: air with a bit of cream in it.Kay Banks is twenty, the only daughter of a successful lawyer, who is living the upper-middle-class Life of Reilly at home with her parents in an immaculate suburb. She has left high school, is not attending college, and clearly does not have and never has had, a job. She is manifestly waiting around for Mr. Right to appear. Mr. Right's appearance is only a matter of time, because Kay is played by an 18-year-old Elizabeth Taylor who is so astonishingly beautiful that the film generates heavy ruminations about the random injustice of the bestowal of genetic gifts. The film also hit the public relations jackpot by being released within a week of the young Taylor's (first) real-life wedding to hotel heir Nicky Hilton, in a bridal gown considerably less demure than the one she finally appears in at the end of this film.Kay, with three brothers, is her father's darling. Dad is played by Spencer Tracy, who manages to be simultaneously gruff, tender, baffled, and shrewd. It's no small feat to walk off with a movie alongside two women as lovely and charming as Taylor and a still-striking Joan Bennett, whose fair, brunette looks, slender figure, and blue eyes make her eminently plausible as Taylor's mother, if not as the middle-aged mother of four grown children. Bennett's no-nonsense Mom is a perfect foil to Tracy's nonplussed-Dad.As the film opens, Kay announces that Mr. Right (""Buckley Dunstan"", if you please!) has indeed appeared, and she is engaged to be married. The rest of the film is taken up with Stanley Banks's struggle with the idea of giving up his adult daughter, and his vain attempts to resist the feminine wedding fever that steamrolls over him and the rest of the household. The film culminates in a very pretty wedding in which the camera focuses dreamily, almost nonstop, on a nearly mute Taylor. The Anglican wedding service (this is Middle America's Dream WASP Family) DOES require both parties to recite the ""to have and to hold"" litany, but all Taylor gets to murmur is ""I will.""The film supports Minnelli's reputation for flair with surface style and charm. But to a modern viewer, the film is most remarkable for the question it does not address: what is a reasonably intelligent, twenty-year-old woman doing living at home with her parents, having never earned a single penny, still sleeping in the adorably fluffy bedroom she grew up in?The short answer, for the film's purposes, anyway, is Taylor's looks. Because, really, would anyone accept her as a nurse or a kindergarten teacher, or a secretary, or any of the other careers that might have been thought suitable for a girl so placed in 1950? Taylor's almost surreal beauty makes anything but a social destiny ludicrous to contemplate, and justifies the film's underlying premise: all this girl is fit for is to wait for Mr. Right, get those looks off the marriage-market and out of the way of other girls, and into a nice house where she can set about passing on her genetic windfall.Among women today, struggling to juggle careers, advanced degrees, mortgage payments, divorce, children, etc., the film may cause some twinges of vestigial envy. Kay's father is SO proud of her on her wedding day: she waits for EXACTLY the right moment to start marching down the aisle! At twenty, that is the greatest challenge she has ever faced. The worst moment Kay has throughout the film is finding out that Buckley wants to go fishing in Nova Scotia on their honeymoon, rather than someplace where she can show off the lovely frocks she has purchased (that is, that her father has purchased) for her honeymoon trousseau. Even Mr. Banks is stunned at the uproar she creates over this discovery.For those who have not always experienced the social upheavals of the last few decades as entirely beneficial, this film occasionally hits below the fantasy-belt, as Kay moves effortlessly from the adoring shelter of her father's lap to the adoring shelter of her husband's.  Kay Banks's life, of course, didn't reflect reality even in 1950 - but that the fantasy of her life can still generate so much secret longing accounts, I suspect, for the affection in which this ridiculous story continues to be held.Sigh. Well, it is a deliciously ridiculous story, with endearing performances, and worth having if only for Tracy's, which confirms his status as one of the canniest and most skillful of American actors.But is it really just 60 or so years since audiences turned this film into one of the era's biggest hits?  Watching it today, it might as well be 600 - only Kate Middleton could relate.",3,Dated Froth of the Most Delicious Kind,1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,5109,"['piece', '1950s', 'froth', 'expertly',

But for this kind of light comedy with a lot of heart, there was no one better.  I also find his chemistry with the lovely Joan Bennett the equal of his famous screen relationship with Katharine Hepburn; he seems just as much at ease with Bennett as he was with Hepburn.

This one sequence brings the audience out of a rather normal and traditional looking world and right into the noir for a moment before bringing us gently back to suburbia again. I also love the ""slice of life"" (as filtered through Hollywood's eye) approach to the film. By this I mean that it's rather fun to see what a modern middle class suburban family and home was like in the late 1940s to the early 1950s (servants and all). I loved seeing lovely Elizabeth Taylor dressed in rolled up blue jeans and a flannel shirt and kerchief, (That woman could wear a potato sack and look elegant) and calling Tracy ""Pop"" in her genuinely affection tone. The entire cast of characters is great with seasoned professionals like Billie Burke and Leo G. Carroll to name just a couple. But Tracy alone is the anchor to this piece, bringing a rye wit and quiet sense of dignity and patience to the whole mess, even when surrounded by the aftermath of the wedding in what looks like a bombed out city complete with with crepe paper. The whole film has such a sweet, satisfying quality that I think, in the hands of a lesser man than director, might have fallen flat. But Minnelli pulls it off brilliantly, balancing charm, sentimentality, humor and even fantasy with just the right touch. And, as others have mentioned in other opinions posted here, it is difficult to compare the original here with later remakes. I do like Steve Martin very much, but there is really nothing to compare next to Spencer Tracy and the subtle expertise of the folks at MGM, circa 1950",4,Dearly Beloved.....,1148688000,"05 27, 2006",2006,1824,"['classic', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'years', 'could', 'only', 'remember', 'inspired', 'hilarious', 'dream', 'sequence', 'where', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'desperately', 'get', 'down', 'fun', 'house', 'aisle', 'get', 'alter', 'daughter', 'bride', 'attendees', 'look', 'horror', 'one', 'sequence', 'audience', 'rather', 'normal', 'traditional', 'looking', 'world', 'right', 'noir', 'moment', 'bringing', 'gently', 'back', 'suburbia', 'again', 'also', 'love', 'slice', 'life', 'filtered', 'Hollywood', 'eye', 'approach', 'film', 'mean', 'rather', 'fun', 'see', 'what', 'modern', 'middle', 'class', 'suburban', 'family', 'home', 'was', 'late', '1940s', 'early', '1950s', 'servants', 'loved', 'seeing', 'lovely', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'dressed', 'rolled', 'up', 'blue', 'jeans', 'flannel', 'shirt', 'kerchief', 'woman', 'could', 'wear', 'potato', 'sack', 'look', 'elegant', 'calling', 'Tracy', 'Pop', 'genuinely', 'affection', 'tone', 'entire', 'cast', 'characters', 'great', 'seasoned', 'professionals', 'Billie', 'Burke', 'Leo', 'G.', 'Carroll', 'name', 'just', 'couple', 'Tracy', 'alone', 'anchor', 'piece', 'bringing', 'rye', 'wit', 'quiet', 'sense', 'dignity', 'patience', 'whole', 'mess', 'even', 'when', 'surrounded', 'aftermath', 'wedding', 'what', 'bombed', 'out', 'city', 'complete', 'crepe', 'paper', 'whole', 'film', 'sweet', 'satisfying', 'quality', 'think', 'hands', 'lesser', 'man', 'director', 'might', 'have', 'fallen', 'flat', 'Minnelli', 'off', 'brilliantly', 'balancing', 'charm', 'sentimentality', 'humor', 'even', 'fantasy', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'other', 'opinions', 'posted', 'here', 'difficult', 'compare', 'original', 'here', 'later', 'remakes', 'do', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'very', 'much', 'really', 'nothing', 'compare', 'next', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'subtle', 'expertise', 'folks', 'MGM', 'circa', '1950']",N/A

And the whole  process of planning the marriage comes along. Bennett wants a big wedding  for her daughter,to replace the one she never had. But Tracy doesn't want  to ruin himself, and tries to keep the wedding as cheap as possible though  it doesn't quite come to this.  The movies is fun, charming and just as  magical as a Tracy film can be. Tracy never acted really but impersonnated  his values and morals through passionnate characters that believed in what  they were saying and stucked to it. And in this particular performance,  he's more vulnerable, than we've seen before, showing the real depth of  what a father goes through when is daughter gets married.

Spencer Tracy is the careworn 'dad' in the title, Joan Bennett, his adoring wife and Elizabeth Taylor is the bride.  In comparing the original with the Steve Martin remake of the early 1990's, its remarkable to see how much of the brilliant screenplay was simply imported for the update.  But for classic buffs, there will only be one ""Father of the Bride"".After their sterling efforts on ""Mildred Pierce"" I had high hopes that Warner was going to continue their excellence in catalogue title remastering.  Perhaps I was mistaken.  Although the original film elements of ""Father of the Bride"" have worn remarkably well, there remain chips, scratches, camera flutter and a few nasty occasions of tearing that crop up on the negative used to remaster this DVD.  The picture has an uncharacteristically soft look to it.  Aliasing, pixelization and edge enhancement are all present, sometimes obviously so. Shimmering of fine details is also a cause for concern.  Over all, this release is a definite step down in committment and quality from other Warner DVD's of the classics and I, for one, find the sudden ""ho-hum"" attitude a bit alarming. The audio, as expected, is mono, as it originally was and, in general, it is nicely represented with little to no background hiss.Extras: REALLY DISAPPOINTING! - two featurettes - one celebrating Elizabeth Taylor's real life marriage to Nicky Hilton, the other, a photo op with then, President Truman, meeting the cast of the film - BOTH WITH NO SOUND!!!

Torn by jealousy, Tracy is all good-natured father exhausted by the complete weight of the problems leading up to the happy day...But it's an ensemble show, and as the typical spoiled daughter of a typical mid-American bourgeois, Elizabeth has one of her joyful screen moments, altering and urging her beloved ones with such gentle, persuasive, winning, and gracious manners...",4,"In one of her most natural performances, Liz is a cheerful light, buoyant in movement...",1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,1322,"['Father', 'Bride', 'mainly', 'delightful', 'family', 'comedy', 'benefits', 'strong', 'central', 'performance', 'One', 'night', 'dinner', 'daughter', 'Kay', 'casually', 'engagement', 'Father', 'react', 'cue', 'Following', 'practically', 'events', 'Edward', 'Streeter', 'charming', 'novel', 'Oscar-Nominated', 'screenplay', 'series', 'comic', 'warm', 'set', 'pieces', 'loving', 'father', 'daughter', 'invite', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'dinner', 'girl', 'parents', 'meet', 'boy', 'parents', 'prospective', 'bride', 'quarrels', 'prospective', 'groom', 'vignettes', 'are', 'applied', 'light', 'Minnelli', 'touch', 'most', 'charming', 'are', 'acted', 'captivating', 'nonchalance', 'incomparable', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'title', 'role', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'Don', 'Taylor', 'complaining', 'middle', 'class', 'father', 'thoughtful', 'daughter', 'welfare', 'watchful', 'distributing', 'money', 'Tracy', 'incredibly', 'amusing', 'Torn', 'jealousy', 'Tracy', 'good-natured', 'father', 'exhausted', 'complete', 'weight', 'problems', 'leading', 'up', 'happy', 'day', 'ensemble', 'show', 'typical', 'spoiled', 'daughter', 'typical', 'mid-American', 'bourgeois', 'Elizabeth', 'one', 'joyful', 'screen', 'moments', 'altering', 'urging', 'beloved', 'ones', 'such', 'gentle', 'persuasive', 'winning', 'gracious', 'manners']",N/A

His reluctance is manifested in his overall discomfort with the wedding planning, which his daughter and wife (Joan Bennett) are wholeheartedly enthusiastic about.Elizabeth Taylor is breathtaking in this role. Her delicate nature is perfect for the part of a timid but emotional young woman. Of course, Spencer Tracy is the real hero of the film.

279221,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,6301967674,Silver Screen,"[12, 12]","Unlike some previous reviewers, I have to say that I think that the original ""Father of the Bride"" has stood the test of time and I found it to be just as enjoyable, if not more so, in some cases, as the Steve Martin remake.Spencer Tracy stars as Stanley Banks, an attorney happily married to his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett), with three children and a lovely house.  His only daughter Kay (Elizabeth Taylor) drops a bombshell on Stanley and Ellie one evening by announcing that she is getting married to someone named Buckley (Don Taylor).  From that moment on, the Banks family's life is turned topsy-turvy by the upcoming wedding.I found Spencer Tracy's performance to be very genuine.  I didn't see him as being so consumed by the cost of the wedding (although what father doesn't worry about the financial bottom line?) that who his daughter was marrying was secondary.  I found his performance reflected the shock and sadness over losing his daughter to Mr. Right and the confusion over getting lost in the wedding shuffle, as most fathers of the bride do.The engagement party, where Stanley is left to tend the kitchen, thereby missing the entirety of the party and the excitement showcases this fact perfectly.  Again, Stanley is left out after the ceremony, when he wants to kiss the bride and cannot seem to get to her.Joan Bennett is wonderfully cast as Ellie, rivaling Myrna Loy as the perfect cinematic mother.Elizabeth Taylor is lovely as the bride to be and although her big fight with Buckley over where they will honeymoon is a bit farfetched (would they really break up over their vacation destination? - - and if they would, wouldn't that signal much larger problems?), her wide-eyed innocence and concern for her father during this time is touching.Interestingly enough, Taylor wore her wedding dress in this film to her actual first wedding to Nicky Hilton, at the time this movie premiered (and was divorcing him by the time they began filming the sequel).This film isn't necessarily Oscar material, but it's a wonderful cinematic collection of some Hollywood greats on film (Tracy, Bennett, Taylor, Billie Burke as the groom's mother) and a definite feel good film for the whole family.RSVP to this one.",5,One Wedding You Definitely Want to Attend,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,2223,"['previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'say', 'think', 'original', 'Father', 'Bride', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'found', 'be', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'cases', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'remake.Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Stanley', 'Banks', 'attorney', 'happily', 'married', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'three', 'children', 'lovely', 'house', 'only', 'daughter', 'Kay', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'bombshell', 'Stanley', 'Ellie', 'one', 'evening', 'announcing', 'getting', 'married', 'someone', 'named', 'Buckley', 'Don', 'Taylor', 'moment', 'Banks', 'family', 'life', 'turned', 'topsy-turvy', 'upcoming', 'wedding.I', 'found', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'performance', 'be', 'very', 'genuine', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'so', 'consumed', 'cost', 'wedding', 'what', 'father', ""n't"", 'worry', 'financial', 'bottom', 'line', 'who', 'daughter', 'was', 'marrying', 'was', 'secondary', 'found', 'performance', 'reflected', 'shock', 'sadness', 'losing', 'daughter', 'Mr', 'Right', 'confusion', 'getting', 'lost', 'wedding', 'shuffle', 'most', 'fathers', 'bride', 'do.The', 'engagement', 'party', 'where', 'Stanley', 'left', 'tend', 'kitchen', 'thereby', 'missing', 'entirety', 'party', 'excitement', 'fact', 'perfectly', 'Again', 'Stanley', 'left', 'out', 'ceremony', 'when', 'kiss', 'bride', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'her.Joan', 'Bennett', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'Ellie', 'rivaling', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'perfect', 'cinematic', 'mother.Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'lovely', 'bride', 'be', 'big', 'fight', 'Buckley', 'where', 'will', 'honeymoon', 'bit', 'farfetched', 'would', 'really', 'break', 'up', 'vacation', 'destination', 'would', 'would', ""n't"", 'that', 'signal', 'much', 'larger', 'problems', 'wide-eyed', 'innocence', 'concern', 'father', 'time', 'touching.Interestingly', 'enough', 'Taylor', 'wore', 'wedding', 'dress', 'film', 'actual', 'first', 'wedding', 'Nicky', 'Hilton', 'time', 'movie', 'premiered', 'was', 'divorcing', 'time', 'began', 'filming', 'sequel', '.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'Oscar', 'material', 'wonderful', 'cinematic', 'collection', 'Hollywood', 'greats', 'film', 'Tracy', 'Bennett', 'Taylor', 'Billie', 'Burke', 'groom', 'mother', 'definite', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'whole', 'family.RSVP', 'one']",N/A
279222,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301967674,Simon Davis,"[3, 3]","&quot;Father of the Bride&quot;, is a total delight from beginning to end blessed as it is with one of the most splendid performances delivered by veteran actor Spencer Tracy in a career littered with fine work. It has quite rightfully earned the status of &quot;classic&quot; and despite it's firm place in 1950's America, it's quite simple premise of one families experience with the nightmare of a wedding &quot;out of control&quot;, is one which still can be identified with even in the present day. It was the first of two wonderful teamings that Spencer Tracy had with his favourite &quot;screen daughter&quot; Elizabeth Taylor and their warm professional and personal regard for each other translates into some terrific screen chemistry in their roles of in-love daughter planning her dream wedding, and harassed father becoming totally traumatised by the expense and size of the affair as it grows bigger by the minute.MGM studios pulled out all the stops to make this film one of their major productions for 1950 and being by tradition the &quot;family Studio&quot; they were ideally suited to bring this story of the ideal family wedding to the screen. Based on a very popular novel of the same title by Edward Streeter it does indeed tell a simple story but laces the proceedings with many highly amusing incidents that most people who have experienced planning a wedding can identify with. Spencer Tracy plays Stanley Banks a prosperous Lawyer who finally it seems has every thing he wants in life, a lovely wife, house fully paid for, a beautiful daughter in college and two young sons. Suddenly he finds his whole cosy existence turned upside down when one evening his cherished daughter Kay (Elizabeth Taylor, never more lovely), announces that she is to be married and immediately Stanley finds himself swept into a whirlpool of wedding preparations designed to drive even the most sane individual into madness. As the date of the wedding approaches the original plans for a &quot;quiet family wedding with just a few friends&quot;, balloons out into a major production and Stanley finds his sanity put to the extreme test as he has to deal with huge bills,  snobby wedding consultants, irrate removalists, bills for invitations, bridemaids gifts,and reluctantly a new tuxedo. He has to share his house with a mounting pile of wedding gifts, some in questionnable taste like Aunt Hattie's Venus de Milo Clock and faces the chore of deciding who can actually be cut out of the invitation list to save costs without some offense being taken. Naturally along the way there are fights, disputes over the mounting costs and the absolute fright when suddenly Kay calls off the whole show when her fiance Buckley Dunstan fails to say he loves her often enough! The dreaded occasion of actually having to meet the &quot;in laws&quot; also causes poor Stanley no end of grief and the meeting ends with him getting totally drunk relating stories of Kay as a young girl to her propective in- laws. When everything is finally in place after months of wedding plans, engagement parties and rehearsals for the big day, followed by the giant wedding that Ellie (Joan Bennett) had always wanted herself but never had, Stanley finally realises that he is being robbed of the one thing that he cherishes most in life, his beloved daughter Kay, the apple of his eye, and realises that things will never be the same for he and Ellie again.With a narration delivered by Spencer Tracy which makes wry observations about the proceedings at hand, &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;, is a highly amusing showcase for his supreme talents as a comic actor which often are forgotten in the light of his countless power house dramatic performances. Nominated for an Academy Award for his wonderful performance as was the film for Best Picture Tracy has never been better than here as we witness with an almost horrified amusement how Stanley's existence spins out of control. Joan Bennett, a frequent co star of Tracy's back at Fox in the 1930's here makes a belated MGM debut as Stanley's wife who gets caught up in all the arrangements for the wedding. Her work with Tracy is magical and it's one of her best later day performances. Her scene dealing with cutting down the invitation list but still wanting to include her Garden Club members as she is due for re-election is priceless. Elizabeth Taylor absolutely shines in the role of Kay and was there ever a more lovely bride seen on screen? Made just prior to her first real life wedding Elizabeth is wonderfully alive as the excited young girl facing marriage and her terrific screen chemistry with Spencer Tracy is a joy and contributes greatly to the more emotional points in the story. A sterling supporting cast so typical of MGM is gathered here, from the &quot;in-laws&quot;,Billie Burke and Moroni Olsen, through to the stuffy disapproving wedding planner Leo G. Carroll in a superb performance who succeeds in a number of highly amusing scenes to ruffle Stanley's already quite tattered feathers.  Directed with gusto by famed director Vincente Minnelli during his golden period at MGM the film was a huge success at the Box Office aided as it was by Elizabeth Taylor's real life nuptials a few months later. Being a major production for that year there is great expertise in every department from  Pandro S. Berman producing, art direction by veteran Cedric Gibbons and stunning costume design, in particular for Elizabeth Taylor's beautiful wedding gown created by designer Helen Rose.Remade in the 1990's, the 1950 version of &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;,is still unsurpassed and preserves forever Spencer Tracy's classic performance which could not be equalled. Passed off by many as now being dated I feel the humour and the situations still ring very true to anyone who has gone through planning a wedding. This terrific film was followed by an enjoyable sequel the following year &quot;Father's Little Dividend&quot; which continued on the trials and tribulations of Stanley Banks now facing the prospect of becoming a Grandfather with amusing results. Both make great classic viewing but this film is the gem of the two and should not be missed.",5,Classic Wedding Comedy With Spencer Tracy Never Better,1063843200,"09 18, 2003",2003,6205,"['quot',

Now that I have, I can honestly say that the remake is nowhere near the quality of this wonderful film.  Spencer Tracy as always is amazing in the lead role as Stanley Banks.  He singlehandedly carries the film with his ""every man"" persona, and loads of charm.  Liz Taylor shows her acting chops here, at just 18 years of age, and the rest of the cast is just terrific.  Direction is by Vincente Minelli is tight and lively.  He keeps things moving, even though the film may have a leisurely pace.
