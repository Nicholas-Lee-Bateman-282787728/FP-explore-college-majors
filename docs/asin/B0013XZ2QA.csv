1144151,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B0013XZ2QA,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[18, 28]","The movie is at times enjoyable and well acted. Okay.Just some background here--According to former Secretary of State Robert Gates in his book _From the Shadows_ the CIA began giving aid to Islamic fighters in Afghanistan several months before the Soviet invasion. Former National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter Zbignew Brzezinski is on public record stating that Carter signed an order on July 3, 1979 to give aid to the mujahadeen. Brzezinski informed Carter in a memo on the same day that ""this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention"". When asked if he had regrets about helping to start a war Brzezinski replied, ""Regret what? That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter. We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam War"".The importance of Charlie Wilson is wildy blown out proportion in this movie and his involvement inaccurately portrayed, as is that of his ""side kick"". The real-life Wilson had always been a hawkish rightwinger and commie hating cold war warrior. In the film we are lead to think Wilson was simply a good time lovin', womanizing, good ole boy Texan Congressman that never really got serious until he saw in person poor Afghan refugees. At this moment in the film Wilson changes before our eyes and now he has a righteous cause. The real Wilson was a friend of Nicaraguan tyrant Anastasio Samoza. Wilson's partner in the movie (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is based on CIA operative Gust Avrakotos. In the 1960s army colonels led a coup in Greece and Avrakotos was the CIA main contact with the notorious fascist regime. Avrakotos was forced to leave Greece by the late 70s, having achieved a very nasty reputation.The aftermath and consequences of this cold war game aren't given their due by this Hollywood movie either. The very weapons the U.S. supplied the mujahadeen were used to wage a lenghty, bloody civil war in Afghanistan. It was well understood who our government was dealing with despite Ronald Reagan's claim that the Afghan fighters were the moral equivalent of America's founding fathers. About half the CIA money went to a monster named Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, a fellow who in his youth used to throw acid in the faces of unveiled women. Hekmatyar was known to be as ""anti-American"" as they come. The CIA and US government would get in bed with anybody just so long as they could serve as a temporary useful pawn in the cold war chess game with the USSR and so the terrorist goon received Stinger missles, training, and lots of money. The Taliban and an group that came to be known as al-Qaeda formed out of the ashes of the Afghan civil war. At the end of the film Charlie Wilson is shown trying to secure money for schools but it's not clear how much a few new schools would help when Reagan's founding fathers liked throwing acid in the face of women and killing teachers that dared try to educate girls.Viewers of the movie are to believe the US means well, but sometimes makes mistakes. Clearly there was little real concern for the fate of Afghanistan and we do get a sense of this when watching the good Charlie Wilson's failed efforts to build some schools. What the movie completely gets wrong is that Washington ever cared about the Afghan people in the first place and not only that but did it's best to draw the Soviet Union into a war with them. I'll not go on about how cliched and formulaic this Hollywood flick is with it's warped fixation on the individual and personal and disregard for mere facts. I hope most Americans don't take movies like this too seriously.",1,Hollywood gets it wrong,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,3750,"['movie', 'times', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'acted', 'background', 'here', 'According', 'former', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Robert', 'Gates', 'book', 'Shadows_', 'CIA', 'began', 'giving', 'aid', 'Islamic', 'fighters', 'Afghanistan', 'several', 'months', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'Former', 'National', 'Security', 'Advisor', 'President', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'Zbignew', 'Brzezinski', 'public', 'record', 'stating', 'Carter', 'signed', 'order', 'July', '3', '1979', 'give', 'aid', 'mujahadeen', 'Brzezinski', 'informed', 'Carter', 'memo', 'same', 'day', 'aid', 'was', 'going', 'induce', 'Soviet', 'military', 'intervention', 'When', 'asked', 'had', 'regrets', 'helping', 'start', 'war', 'Brzezinski', 'replied', 'Regret', 'what', 'secret', 'operation', 'was', 'excellent', 'idea', 'had', 'effect', 'drawing', 'Russians', 'Afghan', 'trap', 'want', 'regret', 'day', 'Soviets', 'officially', 'crossed', 'border', 'wrote', 'President', 'Carter', 'now', 'have', 'opportunity', 'giving', 'USSR', 'Vietnam', 'War', '.The', 'importance', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'wildy', 'blown', 'out', 'proportion', 'movie', 'involvement', 'inaccurately', 'portrayed', 'side', 'kick', 'real-life', 'Wilson', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'hawkish', 'rightwinger', 'commie', 'hating', 'cold', 'war', 'warrior', 'film', 'are', 'lead', 'think', 'Wilson', 'was', 'simply', 'good', 'time', 'lovin', 'womanizing', 'good', 'ole', 'boy', 'Texan', 'Congressman', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'serious', 'saw', 'person', 'poor', 'Afghan', 'refugees', 'moment', 'film', 'Wilson', 'changes', 'eyes', 'now', 'righteous', 'cause', 'real', 'Wilson', 'was', 'friend', 'Nicaraguan', 'tyrant', 'Anastasio', 'Samoza', 'Wilson', 'partner', 'movie', 'played', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'based', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Gust', 'Avrakotos', '1960s', 'army', 'colonels', 'led', 'coup', 'Greece', 'Avrakotos', 'was', 'CIA', 'main', 'contact', 'notorious', 'fascist', 'regime', 'Avrakotos', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'Greece', 'late', '70s', 'having', 'achieved', 'very', 'nasty', 'reputation.The', 'aftermath', 'consequences', 'cold', 'war', 'game', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'due', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'either', 'very', 'weapons', 'U.S.', 'supplied', 'mujahadeen', 'were', 'used', 'wage', 'lenghty', 'bloody', 'civil', 'war', 'Afghanistan', 'was', 'well', 'understood', 'who', 'government', 'was', 'dealing', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'claim', 'Afghan', 'fighters', 'were', 'moral', 'equivalent', 'America', 'founding', 'fathers', 'CIA', 'money', 'went', 'monster', 'named', 'Gulbaddin', 'Hekmatyar', 'fellow', 'who', 'youth', 'used', 'throw', 'acid', 'unveiled', 'women', 'Hekmatyar', 'was', 'known', 'be', 'anti-American', 'come', 'CIA', 'US', 'government', 'would', 'get', 'bed', 'anybody', 'just', 'so', 'long', 'could', 'serve', 'temporary', 'useful', 'pawn', 'cold', 'war', 'chess', 'game', 'USSR', 'so', 'terrorist', 'goon', 'received', 'Stinger', 'missles', 'training', 'lots', 'money', 'Taliban', 'group', 'came', 'be', 'known', 'al-Qaeda', 'formed', 'ashes', 'Afghan', 'civil', 'war', 'end', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'shown', 'trying', 'secure', 'money', 'schools', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'few', 'new', 'schools', 'would', 'help', 'when', 'Reagan', 'founding', 'fathers', 'liked', 'throwing', 'acid', 'face', 'women', 'killing', 'teachers', 'dared', 'try', 'educate', 'girls.Viewers', 'movie', 'are', 'believe', 'US', 'well', 'sometimes', 'mistakes', 'Clearly', 'was', 'little', 'real', 'concern', 'fate', 'Afghanistan', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'when', 'watching', 'good', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'failed', 'efforts', 'build', 'schools', 'What', 'movie', 'completely', 'wrong', 'Washington', 'ever', 'cared', 'Afghan', 'people', 'first', 'place', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'best', 'draw', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'war', ""'ll"", 'not', 'go', 'how', 'cliched', 'formulaic', 'Hollywood', 'flick', 'warped', 'fixation', 'individual', 'personal', 'disregard', 'mere', 'facts', 'hope', 'most', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'movies', 'too', 'seriously']",N/A
1144152,A1166FE81ADOUR,B0013XZ2QA,50s sci-fi Fan,"[1, 1]","As a film Charlie Wilson's War has everything going for it. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay has wit, bite and pace and provides a great vehicle for Tom Hanks (Charlie Wilson) Julia Roberts (Joanne Herring) and Philip Seymour Hoffman (CIA agent, Gust Avrakotos). The three are the power brokers in defeating the Soviets in Afghanistan, although Joanne Herring is the prime mover.I found the scenes with Hoffman the most fun: his ""shattering"" encounter with CIA boss Cravely (John Slattery) was really the way we'd all like to talk to a thickheaded superior. The whisky bottle and ""Charlie's Angels"" and Gust as they alternate in rushing in and out of Charlie's office was a fresh take on farce. I also laughed at the phallic symbolism in Charlie and his constituent putting their Texas cowboy boots on the table as they go head to head over the nativity cr&egrave;che. And I'm curious about the portrait of Joanne Herring done as John Singer Sergent's Madame X (or Madame Pierre Gautreau) in her lavish home.Sorkin's use of the deliberately misunderstood comment is very clever. Charlie and Gusts' sleazy tactic of having the stunningly beautiful belly dancer (Tracy Phillips) perform before the Egyptian Defense Minister (Aharon Ipal&eacute;) to gain audience is great. Clearly appalled, Zvi's(Ken Stott) reaction of, ""Oh, my God!"" is playfully displaced by Gust onto, ""No, she's supposed to be good.""The only downer in the film was Charlie's ignored warning to Congressmen of religious radicals filling the political/social void created by the retreating  Soviets and their the refusal to provide one million dollars for school reconstruction as a way of curtailing their influence on Afghanistan's 50%,often orphaned,under 14 year olds.",5,Eroded Cold War triumph,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,1732,"['film', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'everything', 'going', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'screenplay', 'wit', 'bite', 'pace', 'great', 'vehicle', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Gust', 'Avrakotos', 'three', 'are', 'power', 'brokers', 'defeating', 'Soviets', 'Afghanistan', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'prime', 'mover.I', 'found', 'scenes', 'Hoffman', 'most', 'fun', 'shattering', 'encounter', 'CIA', 'boss', 'Cravely', 'John', 'Slattery', 'was', 'really', 'way', ""'d"", 'talk', 'thickheaded', 'superior', 'whisky', 'bottle', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Gust', 'alternate', 'rushing', 'Charlie', 'office', 'was', 'fresh', 'take', 'farce', 'also', 'laughed', 'phallic', 'symbolism', 'Charlie', 'constituent', 'putting', 'Texas', 'cowboy', 'boots', 'table', 'go', 'head', 'head', 'nativity', 'cr', 'egrave', 'che', ""'m"", 'curious', 'portrait', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'done', 'John', 'Singer', 'Sergent', 'Madame', 'X', 'Madame', 'Pierre', 'Gautreau', 'lavish', 'home.Sorkin', 'use', 'deliberately', 'misunderstood', 'comment', 'very', 'clever', 'Charlie', 'Gusts', 'sleazy', 'tactic', 'having', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'belly', 'dancer', 'Tracy', 'Phillips', 'perform', 'Egyptian', 'Defense', 'Minister', 'Aharon', 'Ipal', 'eacute', 'gain', 'audience', 'great', 'Clearly', 'appalled', 'Zvi', 'Ken', 'Stott', 'reaction', 'Oh', 'God', 'playfully', 'displaced', 'Gust', 'onto', 'No', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'only', 'downer', 'film', 'was', 'Charlie', 'ignored', 'warning', 'Congressmen', 'religious', 'radicals', 'filling', 'political/social', 'void', 'created', 'retreating', 'Soviets', 'refusal', 'provide', 'one', 'million', 'dollars', 'school', 'reconstruction', 'way', 'curtailing', 'influence', 'Afghanistan', '50', '%', 'often', 'orphaned', '14', 'year', 'olds']",N/A

[Symbolism?] Next we see a meeting at the CIA where ""Charlie Did It"". [Or did he?] Congressman Charles Wilson gets an award. ""This is based on a true story"". [It is not a true story in itself.] In April 1980 some people are bathing in a small pool. Dan Rather is on the TV news, the talk is about falling dominoes. Is the Free World doomed unless the Afghan people can defeat the foreign invaders? Charles Wilson must return to Washington DC for an important vote. We learn about his servants and supplicants who want his influence. Wilson will be placed on the ethics committee, he wants something in return. Charlie has all women working in his office. Is he a typical Congressman? Joanna calls him at night.A CIA agent complains about his assignment. Does Gus lack diplomatic skills? Not so you'd notice. Gus talks about his work over lunch. Joanna wants to use Charlie's influence. Why does Congress say one thing and do another? [Is it to fool most voters?] Joanna reviews past imperial actions. She has powerful contacts and influence. [Or is she being used by others?] Russian helicopters attack the ground like some kind of invaders from another world. Charlie meets President Zia of Pakistan, he wants guns and money and control. ""Go to Peshawar to see the refugee camps."" Planting toy mines is part of a diabolical plot. The land there is dry and barren. Charlie gets a briefing about Pakistan. ""It would draw attention."" The local CIA agent must follow orders.Charlie tells about small town life in Texas, and how he became interested in politics. Gus is sent to see Charlie. There is sudden bad news, a scandal about sex and drugs in Congress. [Is this to put pressure on Charlie?] Charlie gets a report on arms. They need plausible denial. Congress doesn't know what its voting on! Charlie's district wants only two things: their guns and low taxes. There is a man in Israel who can help get Russian arms to Pakistan. Can a belly dancer help in diplomatic maneuvers? President Zia agrees to the trade. Was Joanna saved by religion? Charlie talks to another Congressman, Doc Long, who needs a deal. The Congressman makes a speech to the Afghans, and gets cheers. [What was the translation?] Arms like anti-tank missiles are transported into Afghanistan. `Stinger' missiles can destroy helicopters in the air. Afghanistan becomes the first country to defeat the Russian Army. So what will the Afghans do in the future?  ""We'll see."" Does anyone in Washington care afterwards?This is a very clever and cynical film that reveals the personalities of the actors behind the scenes in Washington, an expos&eacute; that doesn't preach. Who is in the Dept. of Agriculture building? This story is well edited and fast-paced as it glides over the background. One Congressman can get elected because of financial support from far outside his district. Do they also knock over any challengers? Fund are doubled or increased ten-fold without any oversight. Do other Congressmen keep a harem in their office? I wonder if these women are asked to provide companionship to other officials? Great Britain lost two wars in the 1870s to conquer Afghanistan and control opium production. No mention of this cash crop in this film. One effect of the Soviet intervention in 1979 was to break up the estates of the big landowners. People raised food rather than opium; this caused a shortage.

In that comment I noted that the reviewer made all the key points about the political meaning of this film, including the obvious ones that there was disturbing absence of context about who these 8th century- loving mujahedeen ""allies"" were and, more importantly, their political program (other than the obvious anti-Soviet one) that Congressman Wilson was so earnestly attempting to help and why the then legally-constituted secular government in Kabul sought out help from the Soviets against this threat. But those are merely just `little' picky points on my part now, right?I would only add that in politics, any kind of politics, as the American government now has been learning under successive Republican and Democratic administrations in relationship to Afghanistan under different circumstances than those portrayed in the film- the enemy of your enemy is not necessarily your friend. I believe that you learn that basic lesson in your youthful schoolyard days, no later. Ouch! The only other point worth noting is that Congressman Wilson surely deserved the citation from the American governmental ""combined intelligences services"" for his services on their behalf in long ago Afghanistan. However, the rest of us are still living with the fall-out from his ""innocent"" escapades.",4,"That Was Then, This Is Now",1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,1767,"['other', 'day', 'made', 'short', 'comment', 'political', 'blog', 'viewing', 'film', 'reading', 'long', 'review', 'gave', 'real', 'details', 'CIA', 'efforts', 'long-term', 'political', 'implications', 'maneuvers', 'Texas', 'Congressman', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'used', 'get', 'secret', 'appropriations', 'fund', 'mujahedeens', 'Afghanistan', 'back', 'earlier', '1980s', 'previous', 'heyday', 'American', 'covert', 'operations', 'world', 'early', 'years', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'comment', 'noted', 'reviewer', 'made', 'key', 'points', 'political', 'meaning', 'film', 'including', 'obvious', 'ones', 'was', 'disturbing', 'absence', 'context', 'who', '8th', 'century-', 'loving', 'mujahedeen', 'allies', 'were', 'more', 'importantly', 'political', 'program', 'other', 'obvious', 'anti-Soviet', 'one', 'Congressman', 'Wilson', 'was', 'so', 'earnestly', 'attempting', 'help', 'why', 'then', 'legally-constituted', 'secular', 'government', 'Kabul', 'sought', 'out', 'help', 'Soviets', 'threat', 'are', 'merely', 'just', 'little', 'picky', 'points', 'part', 'now', 'right', 'would', 'only', 'add', 'politics', 'kind', 'politics', 'American', 'government', 'now', 'been', 'learning', 'successive', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'administrations', 'relationship', 'Afghanistan', 'different', 'circumstances', 'portrayed', 'film-', 'enemy', 'enemy', 'not', 'necessarily', 'friend', 'believe', 'learn', 'basic', 'lesson', 'youthful', 'schoolyard', 'days', 'later', 'Ouch', 'only', 'other', 'point', 'noting', 'Congressman', 'Wilson', 'surely', 'deserved', 'citation', 'American', 'governmental', 'combined', 'intelligences', 'services', 'services', 'behalf', 'long', 'ago', 'Afghanistan', 'However', 'rest', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'fall-out', 'innocent', 'escapades']",N/A

Mike Nichols' adaptation basically stops at the point where the Russians are pushed out of Afganistan.  There's a small vignette where Charlie Wilson has trouble getting funding once the retreat has happened, meant to symbolize Wilson's pithy comment that ""we f---ed up the end game.""  And Philip Seymour Hoffman's Gust Avrakotos has a good exchange in the 'victory' party where he accurately lays out the impending peril.  But, in general, the movie gives short shrift to all the fallout after 'triumph' - Kabul flattened by fractious warlords, the rise of the Taliban, the growing legend and myth of the role of the 'Afghan Arabs' (later to become Al Qaeda), and a general overall sequence of events that Criles calls 'Blowback.'  All of these factors have a contributing hand in what eventually leads to 9/11.  In short, I like the reviewer on this page who entitled his piece ""Be careful what you ask for.""  Exactly.Casting-wise, I never cottoned to Julia Roberts in the role of Joanne Herring.  I thought Tom Hanks did a passable job as Charlie Wilson, but I don't think it ranks with his best work.  Basically, Philip Seymour Hoffman owns the movie.  He's brilliant, getting just the right tone of anger, bullheadedness, dismissiveness and - most importantly - effectiveness, the very qualities that Criles celebrates about Avrakotos in his book.

How can they not be with the absolutely super screenplay of Aaron Sorkin (of The West Wing fame).  It has a fast paced wit, which is expertly played by Hoffman, Hanks and Roberts.  The candor in the dialog of Charlie Wilson (Hanks) and Gust Avrakotos (Hoffman) is priceless.  In 2008, Philip Seymour Hoffman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.  The movie was nominated for 5 Golden Globe Awards: Picture, Screenplay (Sorkin), Actor (Hanks), Supporting Actor (Hoffman), and Supporting Actress (Roberts).Charlie Wilson (Hanks) is a womanizing US congressman from Texas, who hires attractive young women for his Congressional office.  One of his staff is Amy Adams.  Another staff girl has the nickname, ""jail bait"".  Gust Avrakotos (Hoffman) is a blunt CIA operative who covertly helps Wilson (in 1980) supply the Afghans with the weapons to defeat the Soviet Union.  It's also an interesting role for Julia Roberts, who plays a strong-willed, conservative, religious and patriotic zealot, who is capable of pulling some strings.  In the end, however, the US failed to help the Afgans win the peace.  As Wilson said, we blew the end game.The video and audio quality of the blu-ray are first rate.

As a conservative, its angle was so slanted that it managed to ruin its entertainment value entirely. Its writer, Aaron Sorkin, is also the author of ""The West Wing"" which will not surprise anyone once the credits play. The movie begins with Charlie Wilson saying, ""That John Murtha is as clean as my mother's floor"" in regards to an alleged ethics violations and goes downhill from there. Rudi Giuliani also gets dragged into the muck and his name comes up as a prosecutor trying to keep the protagonist down in a drug investigation (for which he was guilty). Wilson, just as with the majority of his leftist peers, thinks that with individual action the means always justify the ends. He bragged of first falling in love with his country after he manipulated a group of black voters to go to the polls and reject a guy who once killed his dog. As it always is with these people, the personal is political and war is permanently declared on reason.All sorts of contemporary political issues are alluded to here such as the ACLU trying to ban Christian displays in public spaces. Predictably, Tom Hanks's Congressman Wilson parrots today's leftist talking points. He informs a preacher that he should move his nativity scene down the road to a church. Then he seduces (or is seduced?) by the preacher's daughter. We find that she's sexually fast and smokes dope--but of course! Yawn, are there any other kinds of preacher's daughters to be found in Hollywood films? The message is all the same politically correct counter-cultural dreck by which the left has been undermining this nation for forty years. Most offensive of all, was that of Julia Roberts being a member of the Minute Women, which automatically made her a right-wing crank as if being opposed to communism was somehow more of a sin than advocating for the totalitarian suppression of individual rights and the concomitant extermination of 100 million souls over the course of the last century.

Through his positions on House subcommittees, Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) has the power to authorize funding to the CIA for covert operations. It was a dark time in America with the economy flailing and cold-war nemesis USSR having just invaded Afghanistan. Wilson becomes concerned that nothing is being done to fight the Russians. Through the help of wealthy Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), Wilson becomes convinced he has to do something. He teams up with Gust Avrakotos (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to devise a plan to funnell arms and funding to Afghanistan so no one will know the Americans are doing it.Director Mike Nichols has crafted a slick movie. It tells a simple story and goes by quickly. While it has tones of being a drama, this really is a comedy. You never get to know who Wilson really is, other than a man who only hires beautiful women to be on his staff and, when he isn't in Congress, is looking for the next good time. Hoffman received awards and accolates for his performance as the foul-mouthed CIA agent. He was amusing, but to me gave a one note performance. Also, his character seemed hidden behind the bushy mustache and the gaudy sunglasses the entire time. Hanks as Wilson and Roberts are fine, but their southern Texas accents don't ring true.Regardless of your politics, I'd recommend this movie. The movie is one thing, the politics surrounding it are an entire different monster. Thankfully, the film doesn't go out of its way to make a political statement. That would have damaged the movie. Many people may forget just how hated and feared the Soviet Union was back in the 1980s. In hindsight, its obvious to see that America's actions in Afghanistan in the 1980s have played a part in the current world situation regarding terrorism.Many were responsible for ending the cold war and Charlie Wilson played a part, maybe a big part, maybe a small, but that doesn't matter. The movie tells his story.

Martin,"[0, 1]","Charlie Wilson's War has a lot of things going for it:  Mike Nichols behind the camera, Aaron Sorkin writing the screenplay, a great cast spearheaded by Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Phillip Seymour Hoffman and a true story as its inspiration.  So why does it all feel so unengaging and dull?  I was expecting a tightly paced, funny, smart and above all, passionate movie about one man who played a major role in the collapse of the Soviet Union.Hanks stars as the title character, a Texas congressman who raises funds and provides weapons for the Afghanastans in their battle with the Soviets in the 80's.  He can't raise the money through the appropriations cmmittee he serves on, so he sets about covertly funding the Afghan's war via a pact with Israel and Pakistan, the fundraising of a right wing aristocrat (Julia Roberts) and the insights of a jaded CIA operative (Hoffman).There's lots of talking and walking (Sorkin trademarks), but you never feel involved in the political wheelings and dealings.  You're relegated to the role of an observer.  The movie never conveys the sense of urgency and the need to do something that Wilson apparently felt after visiting an Afghan refugee camp.  The only times that the movie comes to life is when Hoffman is on camera.  His cynical yet canny operative is tough, funny and smart and he happily joins Wilson's efforts.I'm not sure how much fudging of history the movie did, but it really doesn't matter because you never feel any sense of purpose or accomplishment from Wilson, and likewise you don't really feel his frustration when he realizes that the endgame gets completely messed up.  Surely a movie delaing with events of this magnitude could have stirred up some sort of reaction.

FromThe GraduatetoThe Birdcage, Nichols' eye for a specific brand of snappy and broad-ranging comedy is something to be cherished and respected.That CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is based on actual events also makes this story all the more interesting. Taking place in the office of Congressman Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks,The Da Vinci Code), we're taken on a wild ride of political manipulation that helps defeat communist Russia during the Cold War. Now one might think that such a fantastic thing as eliminating the communist threat would come from an upstanding and righteous man. Not so. Charlie's a womanizing, drinking, and drug-sniffing man who's responsible for a little known congressional district in Texas. But he's also a damn good looking guy, and he's caught the eye of southern socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts,Charlotte's Web), the sixth richest woman in Texas. She implores Charlie to go to Afghanistan and witness the atrocities being committed upon that little-known nation in the name of communism. So Charlie goes and his life is turned around. He comes home and begins pressuring his constituents to place more money and military aid to the freedom fighters in Afghanistan.With Charlie's ideas comes a gruff CIA agent named Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman,Capote) who's abrasive demeanor and beer-gut shape is in direct contrast to Charlie's. But the two learn to cope with one another and bring victory to the Afghan fighters.The most notable performances in the film come not from Hanks, but from Hoffman and Julia Roberts. Philip Hoffman's whip-bang line delivery is astonishing and absolutely hilarious (""What is US strategy?"" ""Most strictly speaking, we don't have one. But we're working on it."" ""Who's we?"" ""Me and three other guys."") And Roberts' performance was quite a surprise. She played the soft but opinionated and strong Ms. Herring exceptionally well, giving one of her finest performances to date. I also enjoyed Amy Adams' (Enchanted) role as Charlie's personal secretary. She was always in the background and always right-on target with her beauty and wit. But even she couldn't stand up to the power that is Philip Seymour Hoffman (he definitely deserved the Oscar nod he got this year for his performance here).This is a funny, sexy, and downright interesting story that few people probably know about.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman, ever the actor's actor, is great as the renegade CIA agent who comes to Wilson's aid so that Wilson has the real facts and not the spin.

I don't like Forrest Gump, and aside from Big, I've never really understand his massive appeal. I either really enjoy Julia Roberts (i.e. Mona Lisa Smile or Steel Magnolias) or I'm lukewarm about her performances. I think Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant in everything he's ever done. Finally, Aaron Sorkin is a dynamic writer.The dialogue is fast-paced, which I usually adore (i.e. 30 Rock, the funniest show on television). When rapid dialogue coexists with Southern accents, it is sometimes difficult to understand. This movie is all dialogue. I found myself listening too hard to the individual words to always understand the depth of plot. It's certainly a history lesson, and the story is fascinating. Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he's in, and he deserved the Oscar nomination for it. I happen to believe his performance was even better than Javier Bardem's winning performance in No Country for Old Men, but I realize I'm in the minority. Tom Hanks was also fantastic, and I am not one to commonly hold this belief. Julia Roberts, despite having very little to do in this incredibly male driven story, was underwhelming. She's from Georgia, and I know she can do a Southern accent well, but her accent in Charlie Wilson's War was odd and un-Texan. She had a few great lines, but they managed to be more throwaways because of her accent and lack of character development. I would have gladly added ten minutes to the film's running time to see Julia Roberts have more to do.All things considered, it's definitely worth seeing, but when you watch it, you may want to keep the remote control nearby to pause and rewind the rapidly fired dialogue. Prepare to once again be in awe of Philip Seymour Hoffman. Also, prepare to be absolutely depressed because the story is true. It's brilliance is in its tragedy; the layers of history must be determined after the fact. I give Aaron Sorkin credit for distilling a complicated part of history into a manageable hour and forty-five minute story. I appreciate the tongue-in-cheek depictions of women at the time. The screenplay and the actresses who portray Wilson's support staff manage to allow viewers to celebrate the decadence of the day with a modern view of its sexist underpinnings.

1144178,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0013XZ2QA,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 4]","I think it important when reviewing a film to review the film as a complete work of art, being aware of current trends and opinions as well as historical accuracy, but willing to hold back political correctness and historical micro-accuracy so that the film can speak for itself. If you are willing to allow the characters to be humans with flaws and the historic events to be abbreviated and truncated so as to make a smooth flowing narrative, then you can 'go with the flow' and enjoy this well written, well directed, well acted and well intentioned film.I found the story here to be fascinating and well presented even though it covers just the high points of a drama that actually took place over 10 years as the Mujadeddin Afghani rebels struggled to repel an invasion by the Soviet Union army at the height of the Cold War.The story is one where a playboy US congressman from the 2nd district in Texas becomes concerned about the struggle of the Afghani's against the Soviets and becomes even more frustrated when he senses that the State Department has no real assistance plans or support for the Afghani struggle. He is aided by wealthy Houston socialite Joanne Herring as well as a frustrated rogue CIA agent, Gust Avrakolos, a 24 year veteran of the Cold War. Through their plotting and deal making and clandestine activities, they are able to increase funding to the Afghani rebels from 5 million a year to 500 million a year and to turn the tide of the war so that the Soviets were bogged down in their own Vietnam.The acting is superb, especially by the three lead actors; Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.Mike Nichol's direction is superb for we are never bored and on the edge of our seats throughout this 102 minute movie that covers over 10 years of cold war struggle. Aaron Sorkin's script is crisp, witty, and creates a cohesive narrative from a wide swath of historic events.The central theme to me seems to be that flawed individuals can do great deeds. A playboy, hard-drinking womanizing congressman becomes genuinely concerned in the plight of the Afghani people and their under equipped rebels. A wealthy right-wing anti-Communist socialite finds just the right politician to be her partner in using her wealth and influence to open doors. A CIA agent, frustrated after 24 years of fighting cold war in a bureaucracy, is willing to take risks and work outside the system to influence the course of historic events. They succeed as a team in a way that none of them could have done alone.  Sometimes working outside the system has its rewards. Sometimes flawed folks engage in great deeds.Should we worry? Should we be concerned that similar clandestine events may be being carried out by persons of influence in high places?

But we have certain advantages in that for any political force moving in a direction will encounter a political force moving in the other direction. A natural system of checks and balances.

1144179,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B0013XZ2QA,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","Charlie Wilson's War is based on the book by ""60 Minutes"" producer George Crile, which was based on Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson, and little known but astonishing historical events. The screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, the man behind ""The West Wing,"" is chock full of the kind of crisp dialogue Sorkin is known for. The director is Mike Nichols, who has quite a r&eacute;sum&eacute; ranging from Whose Afraid of Viginia Woolf? in 1966 to 2004's Closer. Mr. Nichols couldn't ask for a better cast, with Oscar winners Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Philip Seymour Hoffman supported by a cast just as capable as Charlie's Angels--not the ones from the TV Show or the subsequent remake and sequel, the ones on the real Charlie Wilson's staff.Tom Hanks found the charming Congressman a good fit. He made it look so easy you forgot he was acting at all. Julia Roberts made a surprisingly good ultra right wing socialite Joanne Herring. Philip Seymour Hoffman created a complex and compelling character--crusty CIA agent Gust Avrakotos kicking against the grain of the Ivy League culture at The Company. In the behind the scenes bonus material where you see the actual people portrayed, you see that perhaps they had to be toned down a bit, just to be believable. They are all such larger than life and colorful characters, but the actors did a great job of getting the essential nature of the people onscreen. It is a story where people actually make a difference and change the world, in spite of their supposed character flaws--or even because of them. They make some very good lemonade. The real Charlie Wilson gave the film makers free license to portray him as a person who ""likes to chase whiskey and drink women"" because that's what he was. One thing he was not, however; was a hypocrite.-------------Charlie's Angel #4: The Congressman has never been to rehab. They don't serve whisky at rehab.=====================And that, Boo Boo, he tells her, is why she is his press secretary. Amy Winehouse would be proud. Speaking of colorful characters, Joanne Herring is quite the ardent lover of freedom and the American Way, and passionate in its defense. She is given credit as the person who notices the situation in Afghanistan, suffering under a brutal occupation by the Soviets, and pushes Charlie Wilson to do something about it. Though an ultra right wing conservative socialite from Texas, Joanne Herring is nobody's fool. Julia Roberts really has a lot of fun playing her. At one point, after they are in a celebratory mood, she leaves a bar and as she passes by about three of the women on Charlie's staff she uses a common derogatory term reserved for women of easy virtue. I was shocked, but on reflection, I think she was just teasing them, and the unspoken subtext was 'aren't we all? And me, especially.' There is a great scene where Joanne asks Charlie's aid Bonnie (Amy Adams) to get her a dry Bombay martini, straight up, with two olives. Bonnie bristles at being treated like a servant, but Joanne knows she outranks her, and brushes her aside. Though ticked off, she nevertheless goes to fetch the drink.------------------Joanne Herring: She doesn't like me.Charlie Wilson: Everybody likes you.Joanne Herring: She's a liberal.Charlie Wilson: I'm a liberal.Joanne Herring: [puts her hand on his butt] Not where it counts.=============================Lots of sharp, witty dialogue, in the Sorkin manner, between Charlie, Joanne, and Gust. While you are being entertained by it all, the film is also presenting a very solid case for why the covert war in Afghanistan was worthy of support, and how the defeat of the supposedly invincible Red Army in Afghanistan led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was amazing that not only did Charlie Wilson sway congress to act; he also got Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia to support them. All under the radar. Their only regret was that after helping Afghanistan defeat the Russians, they did little to help them rebuild, resulting in the rise of the Taliban. I wouldn't call the film historical revisionism as much as it is just revealing a little history that was overlooked at the time. Did I mention the sharp and witty dialogue?----------------------Charlie Wilson: I stood in Harold Holt's office in Islamabad, and I offered him the keys to the safe. I said to him, ""What do you need?"" And I was apparently annoying him.Gust Avrakotos: Well, that's because Harold Holt is a tool. He's a cake-eater, he's a clown, he's a bad station chief, and I don't like to cast aspersions on a guy, but he's going to get us all killed.========================================SELECTED FILM ROLES FROM THE CAST OF CHARLIE WILSON'S WARDoubt(2008) ....

The movie ended with such a truthful but sour note where the US government failed to follow through with providing assistance to Afghanistan, leaving the viewer with what might have been if it had.What I did not appreciate was the pervasive portrayal of religious people as being hypocritical and not living out their professed faith. One wonders did Mr. Wilson truly associate with church goers who did not live out what they believed and engaged in such lewd and sexualy immoral acts or was it the screenwriter's and/or the director's personal gripe against Christianity that decided to depict Christians in such an unfavorable light.

1144184,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B0013XZ2QA,Chris Luallen,"[2, 2]","Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a boozing and womanizing Texas Congressman who becomes interested in increasing United States military aid to the Afghan mujahadeen resisting the Soviet invasion. He is spurred on in his efforts by Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), a wealthy anti-Communist matron who Wilson is also sleeping with, and Gust, a CIA agent who, like Wilson, plays by his own set of rules but is highly effective.I found this to be a highly entertaining movie. Charlie is a flawed but well intentioned man who sees a chance to make history and takes advantage of it. Tom Hanks does a terrific acting job as does Julia Roberts. Joanne Herring is the type of person I would probably despise in real life but Roberts makes her almost likable. The shortcoming of this movie is that it sometimes chooses style over substance and when dealing with such a serious topic this doesn't always work. I was especially disappointed that the movie ended so abruptly following the defeat of the Soviets. It only shows Wilson unsuccessfully asking for more American aid to help build Afghan schools and then a brief epilogue stating that the U.S. succeeded in getting the Soviets out of Afghanistan but screwed up the endgame. With an extra 30 minutes the film could have shown exactly what happened with this ""endgame"". This would have given the film more depth, strengthened the irony suggested by Gust's ""Zenmaster story"" and perhaps made this a great movie rather than just a very good one.The truth is that Aghanistan was left in a state of chaos. Eventually, a group of Muslim extremists known as the Taliban took power. Besides setting up what was perhaps the most fanatical Muslim theocracy in the world, the Taliban also provided safe haven to Osama Bin Ladin following 9/11. Osama was a particular friend of the Afghan extremists as he had served in the mujahadeen during the war against the Soviets. This victory over one of the ""Great Satan"" superpowers gave Muslim terrorists around the world confidence that they could also defeat the other ""Great Satan"" - the United States - and we are still fighting them today and will probably continue to fight them for the foreseeable future. It is this sort of unintended consequnce of U.S. foreign policy that the movie wants us to think about.",4,Fascinating Story With Great Acting But Lacking A Bit Of Depth,1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,2291,"['Charlie', 'Wilson', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'boozing', 'womanizing', 'Texas', 'Congressman', 'who', 'interested', 'increasing', 'United', 'States', 'military', 'aid', 'Afghan', 'mujahadeen', 'resisting', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'spurred', 'efforts', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'wealthy', 'anti-Communist', 'matron', 'who', 'Wilson', 'also', 'sleeping', 'Gust', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'Wilson', 'plays', 'own', 'set', 'rules', 'highly', 'effective.I', 'found', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'flawed', 'well', 'intentioned', 'man', 'who', 'chance', 'make', 'history', 'advantage', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'terrific', 'acting', 'job', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'type', 'person', 'would', 'probably', 'despise', 'real', 'life', 'Roberts', 'almost', 'likable', 'shortcoming', 'movie', 'chooses', 'style', 'substance', 'when', 'dealing', 'serious', 'topic', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'was', 'especially', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'ended', 'so', 'abruptly', 'following', 'defeat', 'Soviets', 'only', 'Wilson', 'unsuccessfully', 'asking', 'more', 'American', 'aid', 'help', 'build', 'Afghan', 'schools', 'then', 'brief', 'epilogue', 'stating', 'U.S.', 'succeeded', 'getting', 'Soviets', 'Afghanistan', 'screwed', 'up', 'endgame', 'extra', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'endgame', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'more', 'depth', 'strengthened', 'irony', 'suggested', 'Gust', 'Zenmaster', 'story', 'perhaps', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'rather', 'just', 'very', 'good', 'one.The', 'truth', 'Aghanistan', 'was', 'left', 'state', 'chaos', 'Eventually', 'group', 'Muslim', 'extremists', 'known', 'Taliban', 'took', 'power', 'setting', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fanatical', 'Muslim', 'theocracy', 'world', 'Taliban', 'also', 'provided', 'safe', 'haven', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Ladin', 'following', '9/11', 'Osama', 'was', 'particular', 'friend', 'Afghan', 'had', 'served', 'mujahadeen', 'war', 'Soviets', 'victory', 'one', 'Great', 'Satan', 'superpowers', 'gave', 'Muslim', 'terrorists', 'world', 'confidence', 'could', 'also', 'defeat', 'other', 'Great', 'Satan', 'United', 'States', 'are', 'still', 'fighting', 'today', 'will', 'probably', 'continue', 'fight', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'sort', 'unintended', 'consequnce', 'U.S.', 'foreign', 'policy', 'movie', 'think']",N/A
1144185,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0013XZ2QA,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 4]","Formerly a Democratic U.S. Representative from Texas' 2nd congressional district, Charlie Wilson is known for getting Congress to support the arming of the Afghan Mujahideen during the Afghan-Soviet War. It can be argued that Wilson's actions helped to end the Cold War: because he convinced Congress to fund the effort, the fighters in Afghanistan received a number of weapons, and because of that, the Russians were defeated. But there's more to Wilson than this. In fact, he's more known for his personality than his politics; he was quite the drinker and ladies' man, earning him the nickname ""Good Time"" Charlie. If Mike Nichols' ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is any indication, then he must have been an incredibly charming man with character flaws that made him more endearing than off-putting. Tom Hanks plays the title character with subdued style, allowing the smooth talking liberal to seem that much more realistic.What makes this movie all the more interesting is that it takes a serious historical event and actually makes it funny. I initially didn't see how such a thing would be possible, but then I remembered such films as ""Wag the Dog"" and ""Man of the Year"" and realized that politics are actually a laugh riot. What makes ""Charlie Wilson's War"" even funnier is that it's based on actual fact--the politics are not satirized, but representative of real people, places, and events. This is a sharp, intelligent comedy that doesn't create humor so much as it shows it was there to begin with.The film begins in 1980 with Wilson visiting a friend in Las Vegas. As he sits completely naked in a hot tub--along with a group of completely naked strippers and coke-snorting TV executive Paul Brown (Brian Markinson)--he watches a television displaying coverage of the crisis in Afghanistan. This must of kick started the wheels in his head; not long afterwards, he learns that the Afghans need more effective weapons to shoot down Russian helicopters, which have caused the most damage in the area. Wilson, who was once on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, decides to help in the war effort. But there are two problems: (1) the current war budget is set at $5 million, which isn't nearly enough; (2) it would be unwise to risk having American-made weapons discovered in the hands of the Afghans.In order to solve the budget problem, Wilson convinces Congress to continually increase the budget (starting at $10 million and gradually increasing all the way up to $1 billion). He also follows the advice of his romantic interest--the conservative, anti-communist Texas millionaire Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts)--and flies to Pakistan to meet President Zia (Om Puri). He urges Wilson to visit the refugee camps, which are sprawling and filled with despair; I distinctly remember a moment with he speaks with two children, both of whom fell victim to miniature bombs made to look shiny and fun, much like toys. As it would for most people, seeing this convinces Wilson that something drastic needs to be done, something that will bring an end to the Afghan-Soviet War.But solving the weapon problem won't be so easy. Herring makes a radical suggestion: the Afghan suppliers should be the Israelis, who have a wealth of anti-aircraft weapons (which, ironically, were produced in the Soviet Union). The idea of Afghans and Israelis working together is nearly impossible to conceive, especially for Wilson. Upon returning to the United States, he gets help from Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a perpetually frustrated CIA agent; he arranges for Wilson to meet an Israeli weapons dealer, and the two come to an understanding while a Texas belly dancer performs. Apparently, belly dancing had always been her dream.It's this sense of political ridiculousness that makes ""Charlie Wilson's War"" a thoroughly entertaining, humorous film. Consider the fact that young women with ample breasts staff Wilson's office, and yes, they're very good employees. Also consider a supporting performance by Amy Adams--she plays Bonnie Bach, Wilson's personal assistant. She balances the film nicely, adding to the realism that much more. But it's the overall sense of political game playing that made this work so well; Charlie Wilson was a flawed man who got results, but in the end, it's unclear as to whether or not the results were wanted. Yes, the Afghan-Soviet War ended, but at what cost? Remember that the Freedom Fighters we helped have since become the Taliban. Did we, in fact, do more harm than good back in the 1980s? I definitely can't answer that question, and considering the current state of the world, I don't think Charlie Wilson can, either.",4,Bring Down Those Helicopters!,1198713600,"12 27,

Middleton,"[1, 1]","Most films about American history and their government are either very serious or at least a satire to perhaps, at times, a spoof; Charlie Wilson's War, directed by the legendary Mike Nichols and the supurb screenplay written by the creator and co-writer of the hit TV show The West Wing, Aaron Sorkin, approaches a serious subject matter though with subtlty, wit and sophisticated humour.Based on the book by George Crill the 3rd, reveals this larger than life congressman from Texas, Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) who, in the summer of 1980, watched a news report on the USSR'S war with Afganistan. Through backdoor negotiations and motivation from a high powered campaign contributor (Julia Roberts) visits a refugee camp in Pakistan that moves him into action to aid the Afgani's against the Russian invasion.The Cold War around this time was still in full swing and the aid to Afganistan wasn't enough to beat the ""Evil Empire"" thus this playboy congressman from Texas, (who drinks single malt scotch like water throughout the film) almost single handedly, along with a frazzled, cynical CIA Operative (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), raise enough cash to supply Afganistan with the hardware required to bring down the Russian Helicoptors that had been reeking havock for many years. According to the film, in the end, Wilson managed to raise a billion dollars for the cause ending in a defeated USSR.All the performances, particularly those of Hanks, Seymour, and Roberts were impeccable. Arguably, Seymour has to be one of the great ""character"" actors in Hollywood working today.The message at the films end is true as it has been repeated many times since the Afganistan Russian war.

He did drugs, he slept with strippers and prostitutes, and he had a lot of shady deals going on under the table.  But damn if he didn't get something right.  He saw a need to arm the Afghanistan rebels against the Soviet Union, and in so doing, allowed for Afghanistan to become the first nation to successfully rebel against the Soviet Union.I wasn't much familiar with the story until I watched the movie--one of those ""greatest stories never told"" things, I reckon.  But I'm glad I watched the movie, and am going to go out and read the book, and read up on what happened.  Tom Hanks is engaging, as he tends to be (in fact, he's often SO engaging that I'm not a fan; he's won me over with a few roles in the past, however, and this is one of them).  Julia Roberts sizzles; again, I've never been a huge fan (I can think of a LOT of things I'd rather do than sit through ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" one more time) but she captivated me here.The standout role here, however, is definitely that of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  He's rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors in Hollywood.  His comedic timing is near-perfect (Tom Hanks, to his credit, matches him step for step; even Roberts gets in a nice jab or two).  I'm not sure why he didn't win Best Supporting Actor for this (well, yes I am: it's hard to beat Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh, but that's another movie and another review).  Still...watch and learn, folks.  This guy is a master-in-the-making.The writing is crisp, the direction almost flawless.  There are a few points at which the film lags, but overall, it's a crisp, wicked good time.  There aren't much bonus features, though the two documentaries (a ""making-of,"" as well as a piece on Charlie Wilson) are interesting.  But you should buy the movie for the sake of watching the movie; bonus features are ""bonus"" anyways, remember?  It's the movie that counts.  And ""Charlie Wilson's War"" counts for quite a lot.  Perhaps it's not a classic...but it's damn good just the same.The main moral of this story, if we can call it that, is that good guys don't always wear white hats.  A cliche, but shoot me.  The most interesting--and, get this, REAL--protagonists are the ones who are flawed, who don't always follow the yellow brick road, but can still stand up for what they believe is just and fair.

Get it at Amazon.]BEWARE SPOILERS!!Director Mike Nichols is a past master of women's point of view films that go beyond the narrow confines of the ""chick flick.""  Silkwood (1983); Heartburn (1986); Working Girl (1988); and the very fine Postcards from the Edge (1990) come to mind.  His first feature was an adaptation of Edward Albee's play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor back in 1966.  He followed the next year with the generation-defining The Graduate with Dustin Hoffman.  His films feature fine satire played along the cutting edge of the popular culture.Here he deviates slightly to celebrate Texas congressman Charlie Wilson who managed to persuade Congress to support the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union in the 1980s.  In particular Wilson was able to get American shoulder-launched Stinger missiles for the locals to shoot down Soviet aircraft.  In the film we see some nice graphics of just how effective those missiles were.  It is no exaggeration to say that Charlie Wilson's intervention turned the tide against the Soviets and eventually persuaded them to withdraw.  A few years later, as we all know, the Soviet Union came to its sputtering end.Nichols's ""celebration"" of Congressman Wilson is however mitigated by the revelation that Good Time Charlie was no angel.  Tom Hanks plays the alcoholic and cocaine snorting congressman with a genial--almost innocent--duplicity that only hints at the Machiavellian personality required to properly grace the hallowed halls of Congress.  Hanks is just too sweet, a nice guy playing at being a practiced power broker.  What is missing is the edge of obsession and single-minded egoism.  Perhaps we needed John Malkovich with an east Texas twang.Julia Roberts plays Wilson's long-time girlfriend whose interest in defeating the godless communists stems not from any sympathy for the out-gunned Afghans but from religious sensibilities of the sort usually associated with evangelical members of the Daughters of the American Revolution.  I found her white wig and high-toned manner a step in the wrong direction for Miss Roberts.  I fear that the transition she is making from starlet to star to character actor is an embarrassment that she might want to avoid.The real star of this film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman who plays the international operative and sometime American spy, Gust Avrakotos, a sneaky, blunt and very smart guy who also wants to defeat the Soviets.  Hoffman brings to the part the kind of rough edge and frankly Machiavellian intent missing in Tom Hanks' character.The film is marred slightly by a depiction of people in power and their environs that conforms to something like television's mass culture with lots of sleeping around and sharp-edged wise-cracking on the spot, and a somewhat simplistic story line.  None of this is to be helped since a living must be made and producers must be assured that the mass audience will attend. Mike Nichols is used to this, and it is remarkable how many fine films he has made that simultaneously seduced not only the money men and the audience, but the critics as well.The message of the film is contained in a Zen master story that goes like this (I am paraphrasing from the quotations page at the Internet Movie Database site):There's a little boy and on his 14th birthday who gets a horse, and everybody in the village says, ""How wonderful.  The boy got a horse.""  And the Zen master says, ""we'll see.""  Two years later the boy falls off the horse, breaks his leg, and everyone in the village says, ""how terrible.""  And the Zen master says, ""we'll see.""  Then, a war breaks out and all the young men have to go off and fight except the boy who can't because his legs are all messed up.  And everybody in the village says, ""How wonderful.""  And again the Zen master says, ""we'll see.""This captures the spirit of our continuing military involvement in the Middle East.  Today's results may look good or bad but can only be really defined by the unintended consequences to come.  We armed the Afghans.  Unfortunately their triumph against the Soviet Union led to the rise of the Taliban, and that to their harboring of Al Qaeda which led to 9/11, which led to... and so on.  How Charlie Wilson's War ultimately ends may not be known for generations.See this for Mike Nichols whose clear direction and sharp eye for satire is undiminished as he approaches his ninth decade of life.

1144201,A2PZ1W2Q4JQQWA,B0013XZ2QA,"Devon Christopher Adams ""www.nooccar.com""","[1, 4]","I knew absolutely nothing about Charlie Wilson before sitting down to watch and review this film today. I assumed he was a real person and I was about to immerse myself in some biopic. I had no frame of reference whatsoever and couldn't even tell you what decade I was getting myself into. I just wanted to catch a good flick and here I found myself. I wonder if my uneducated background on Wilson's fight for the Afghan's in the 1980s allowed me to focus on the film itself without any expectations, and without those expectations and with very little information beyond the actual film, I didn't feel convinced. Hank's as Wilson wasn't bad as a character, and the film begins with a flashback from him receiving the top award a citizen can ever received as if this one event was his most successful in life. The film then flashes back to a buffoon of a congressman from Texas sitting in a hot tub in Vegas with a couple of strippers and some Cocaine, but by the end of the film the viewer's are supposed to believe Wilson's quasi-altruistic motives were genuine. I don't think I was convinced.I've rarely agreed with critics praise for Hanks and usually cannot forget it's Tom Hanks playing an actor (Forrest Gump withstanding), and this film is exception. Hanks introduced as a womanizer, whiskey-guzzler from Texas was never forgotten by the viewer as he tramped around Afghanistan supposedly becoming affected by the warn torn (literally) children. But the only time I truly believed this was the purpose of Wilson's quest was when he continually mentioned it to any congressman who had money as his disposal.A relatively elderly Ned Beatty looked withered and tired as if he were acting only for the check as a congressman dragged to Afghanistan with his wife. His performance was almost an afterthought that not even a Hilly Billy in West Virginia would remember, while Julia Robert's Texan was played with similar banality. Her billing over Phillip Seymour Hoffman felt like a credit writer's error.And even though this film is up for a handful of Oscars and given Hoffman's natural talents, I would argue that the two shining stars in this film were Hoffman as a CIA agent who claimed he only helped Wilson because he had nothing better to do, and Amy Adams who's received more praise this year as a Disney princess thrust into the real world in Enchanted. Adams' as the congressman's administrative assistant finds herself in several questionable and not-so-questionable situations in the film from being surrounded by large breasted, small brained women working in Wilson's office to traipsing about the Middle East with him. She added a sense of genuine dramatic artistry to the film, while Hoffman's agent plays Hoffman as a relatively clandestine character as he so naturally and enjoyably does. So enjoyable he's up for Best Supporting Actor in a tight race that's focusing on Hal Holbrook's 82 year-old under dog fighting against the larger than life Javier Bardem. But of the two, Adams' steals the scene of supporting talent while finishing Julia Robert's Joann's martini while sitting with her two greyhounds while Hanks and Roberts strategically and sexually prepare to fund Charlie Wilson's War.",3,"Good one, but a little odd",1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,3216,"['knew', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'sitting', 'down', 'watch', 'review', 'film', 'today', 'assumed', 'was', 'real', 'person', 'was', 'about', 'immerse', 'biopic', 'had', 'frame', 'reference', 'whatsoever', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'what', 'decade', 'was', 'getting', 'just', 'wanted', 'catch', 'good', 'flick', 'here', 'found', 'wonder', 'uneducated', 'background', 'Wilson', 'fight', 'Afghan', '1980s', 'allowed', 'focus', 'film', 'expectations', 'expectations', 'very', 'little', 'information', 'actual', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'convinced', 'Hank', 'Wilson', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'character', 'film', 'flashback', 'receiving', 'top', 'award', 'citizen', 'can', 'ever', 'received', 'one', 'event', 'was', 'most', 'successful', 'life', 'film', 'then', 'back', 'buffoon', 'congressman', 'Texas', 'sitting', 'hot', 'tub', 'Vegas', 'couple', 'strippers', 'Cocaine', 'end', 'film', 'viewer', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Wilson', 'quasi-altruistic', 'motives', 'were', 'genuine', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'convinced.I', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'agreed', 'critics', 'praise', 'Hanks', 'usually', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'playing', 'actor', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'withstanding', 'film', 'exception', 'Hanks', 'introduced', 'womanizer', 'whiskey-guzzler', 'Texas', 'was', 'never', 'forgotten', 'viewer', 'tramped', 'Afghanistan', 'supposedly', 'becoming', 'affected', 'warn', 'torn', 'literally', 'children', 'only', 'time', 'truly', 'believed', 'was', 'purpose', 'Wilson', 'quest', 'was', 'when', 'continually', 'mentioned', 'congressman', 'who', 'had', 'money', 'disposal.A', 'relatively', 'elderly', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'looked', 'withered', 'tired', 'were', 'acting', 'only', 'check', 'congressman', 'dragged', 'Afghanistan', 'wife', 'performance', 'was', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'not', 'even', 'Hilly', 'Billy', 'West', 'Virginia', 'would', 'remember', 'Julia', 'Robert', 'Texan', 'was', 'played', 'similar', 'banality', 'billing', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'felt', 'credit', 'writer', 'error.And', 'even', 'film', 'up', 'handful', 'Oscars', 'given', 'Hoffman', 'natural', 'talents', 'would', 'argue', 'two', 'shining', 'stars', 'film', 'were', 'Hoffman', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'claimed', 'only', 'helped', 'Wilson', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'who', 'received', 'more', 'praise', 'year', 'Disney', 'princess', 'thrust', 'real', 'world', 'Enchanted', 'Adams', 'congressman', 'administrative', 'assistant', 'several', 'questionable', 'not-so-questionable', 'situations', 'film', 'being', 'surrounded', 'large', 'breasted', 'small', 'brained', 'women', 'working', 'Wilson', 'office', 'traipsing', 'Middle', 'East', 'added', 'sense', 'genuine', 'dramatic', 'artistry', 'film', 'Hoffman', 'agent', 'Hoffman', 'relatively', 'clandestine', 'character', 'so', 'naturally', 'enjoyably', 'So', 'enjoyable', 'up', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'tight', 'race', 'focusing', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', '82', 'year-old', 'dog', 'fighting', 'larger', 'life', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'two', 'Adams', 'steals', 'scene', 'supporting', 'talent', 'finishing', 'Julia', 'Robert', 'Joann', 'martini', 'sitting', 'two', 'greyhounds', 'Hanks', 'Roberts', 'strategically', 'sexually', 'prepare', 'fund', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War']",N/A
1144202,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B0013XZ2QA,D. Hartley,"[6, 8]","Aaron Sorkin, you silver-tongued devil, you had me at: ""Ladies and gentlemen of the clandestine community...""That line is from the opening scene of  ""Charlie Wilson's War"", in which the title character, a Texas congressman (played in full Gumpian southern-drawl mode by Tom Hanks) is receiving an Honored Colleague award from the, er-ladies and gentlemen of the clandestine (read: CIA) community.Sorkin, (creator/writer of ""The West Wing"" TV series) provides the smart, snappy dialog for high-class director Mike Nichols' latest foray into political satire, a genre he hasn't dabbled in since his excellent 1998 film ""Primary Colors"".Wilson, known to Beltway insiders as ""good-time Charlie"" during his congressional tenure, is an unlikely American hero. He drank like a fish and loved to party, but could readily charm key movers and shakers into supporting his pet causes and any attractive young lady within range into lifting her skirt. So how did this whiskey guzzling romeo circumvent the official U.S. government foreign policy of the time (mid to late 1980s) and help the Mujahideen rebels drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, ostensibly paving the way for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War?He did it with a little help from his friends- a coterie of strange bedfellows including an Israeli arms dealer, a belly-dancing girlfriend, high-ranking officials in Egypt and Pakistan, a misanthropic but handily resourceful CIA operative, and ""the sixth-richest woman in Texas"", who also happened to be a fervent anti-communist. It's quite the tale.Phillip Seymour Hoffman continues his nearly perfect track record of stealing just about every film he appears in. He plays the aforementioned CIA operative, Gust Avrakotos with much aplomb. His character is, shall we say, ""less than diplomatic"" in dealing with co-workers (and superiors), which makes him a bit of a pariah at the Agency. Through serendipitous circumstance, Gust falls in league with Wilson and one of his lady friends, a wealthy socialite named Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts, bearing a spooky resemblance to Joan Rivers).The three amigos form a sort of political ""X-Men"" team; each one has their own unique ""special power"" to bring to the table. Once Joanne lures powerful and influential congressman Doc Long (the wonderful Ned Beatty) on board, the deal is sealed.Aside from the expected bit of ""creative license"", Nichols doesn't deviate too much from the facts laid out in the book by George Crile; despite some inherent elements of political satire, it's a fairly straightforward rendering. What is most interesting to me is what they left out. One incident in particular, which involved a private arms dealer ""accidentally"" blowing up a D.C. gas station (oops!) on his way to a meeting with Wilson and Avrakotos, seems like it would have been a no-brainer for the movie.One final thought. After the film's high-fiving, feel-good, flag waving coda subsided and the credits started rolling, something was nagging. And then it dawned on me.

1144203,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B0013XZ2QA,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[6, 7]","Back in the days before the tearing down of the Berlin Wall,  a slick Democrat Congressman from Lufkin, Texas named Charlie Wilson almost single-handedly insured that the Afghans had the fire power necessary to rip the invading Soviet air force to shreds.  Don't know about you, but I remember news footage of Soviet troops retreating from Afghanistan, but I never heard the name Charles Nesbitt Wilson until just a few days ago.Director Mike Nichols along with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (West Wing) gives us a fast-paced, never-boring hour-and-a-half romp that takes us on a magical carpet ride from the moment Charlie becomes aware of the Afghans plight---this bell went off in his head amidst the clinking of ice in a Scotch tumbler in a Las Vegas hot tub with a bevy of buxom strippers - to the ecstatic moment of mujahedeen rejoicing with victory arm-raised anti-aircraft weaponry.  Thankfully, Nichols and Sorkin don't annoy us with any sanctimonious dribble or agenda conscious propaganda with regard to the upcoming 2008 presidential campaigns.  Instead they tell a thoroughly enjoyable tall but nevertheless true tale of the high flying world of politicians, covert agents, world leaders, rich altruistic benefactresses and a few big breasted, tight-skirted bimbettes that crumble willingly in the presence of Washington power.The usually good guy persona of Tom Hanks gets traded in for that of the overblown high drinking rou&eacute;, Charlie Wilson, that surrounds himself with hot girls and aged single malt 24/7.  Hanks must have had a ball with this role--he looks easy and relaxed--in a paunchy second skin that fits about him like the fumes emitted from the high octane gas pump.  As he rolls with the punches on the Hill, Hanks as Wilson especially sparkles while volleying intelligent zingers back and forth with Philip Seymour Hoffman who plays rough and ready CIA operative, Gust Avrakotos.  Together, Hanks and Hoffman deftly maneuver the film through scenes with heads of state who historically do nothing but butt heads, effervescent cocktail parties and fund raisers where church-going Christian zealots pull out the stops to ensure a jihad that stamps out the spread of communism, and midnight meetings of white-shirted chess-playing nerds that phases out a battle in the Cold War with dollars and ingenuity.  Along with Hanks and Hoffman, Julia Roberts stands tall as the indomitable Joanne Herring, a Texas heiress intent of foiling the Soviet Union with Southern Baptist good time religion, international influence and plenty of bucks.  Despite the frou-frou hair, Julia does what she does best---creates, albeit humorously, a Julia manikin that seems larger than life.  While stealing every scene with her big hair, big teeth and sly eyes, she wields more power than any of the men, wrapping them all around her little finger with the finesse of the Hope diamond.Bottom line?  ""Charlie Wilson's War"" gallops through the story of how the Afghan resistance caged the mighty Soviet bear with the covert help of an extremely functional triumvirate consisting of Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Mixing two parts sex with three parts booze and 3oo million parts black appropriations concocts a Molotov cocktail that skyrockets enough Soviet Mil Mi-24 helicopters to the moon while depicting diplomacy and politics at their humorous and implemental best.  Fast and fun, this film is recommended to all those who like their history neat without a beer chaser.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,Party-ing Politics,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,3537,"['Back', 'days', 'tearing', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'slick', 'Democrat', 'Congressman', 'Lufkin', 'Texas', 'named', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'insured', 'Afghans', 'had', 'fire', 'power', 'necessary', 'rip', 'invading', 'Soviet', 'air', 'force', 'shreds', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'remember', 'news', 'footage', 'Soviet', 'troops', 'retreating', 'Afghanistan', 'never', 'heard', 'name', 'Charles', 'Nesbitt', 'Wilson', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'ago.Director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'screenwriter', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'West', 'Wing', 'fast-paced', 'never-boring', 'hour-and-a-half', 'romp', 'magical', 'carpet', 'ride', 'moment', 'Charlie', 'aware', 'Afghans', 'plight', '-this', 'bell', 'went', 'off', 'head', 'clinking', 'ice', 'Scotch', 'tumbler', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'hot', 'tub', 'bevy', 'buxom', 'strippers', 'ecstatic', 'moment', 'mujahedeen', 'rejoicing', 'victory', 'arm-raised', 'anti-aircraft', 'weaponry', 'Thankfully', 'Nichols', 'Sorkin', 'do', ""n't"", 'annoy', 'sanctimonious', 'dribble', 'agenda', 'conscious', 'propaganda', 'regard', 'upcoming', '2008', 'presidential', 'campaigns', 'Instead', 'tell', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'tall', 'nevertheless', 'true', 'tale', 'high', 'flying', 'world', 'politicians', 'covert', 'agents', 'world', 'leaders', 'rich', 'altruistic', 'benefactresses', 'few', 'big', 'breasted', 'tight-skirted', 'bimbettes', 'crumble', 'willingly', 'presence', 'Washington', 'power.The', 'usually', 'good', 'guy', 'persona', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'traded', 'overblown', 'high', 'drinking', 'rou', 'eacute', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'hot', 'girls', 'aged', 'single', 'malt', '24/7', 'Hanks', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'ball', 'role', 'easy', 'relaxed', 'paunchy', 'second', 'skin', 'fumes', 'emitted', 'high', 'octane', 'gas', 'pump', 'punches', 'Hill', 'Hanks', 'Wilson', 'especially', 'volleying', 'intelligent', 'zingers', 'back', 'forth', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'rough', 'ready', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Gust', 'Avrakotos', 'Together', 'Hanks', 'Hoffman', 'deftly', 'maneuver', 'film', 'scenes', 'heads', 'state', 'who', 'historically', 'do', 'nothing', 'butt', 'heads', 'effervescent', 'cocktail', 'parties', 'fund', 'raisers', 'where', 'church-going', 'Christian', 'zealots', 'out', 'stops', 'ensure', 'jihad', 'out', 'spread', 'communism', 'midnight', 'meetings', 'white-shirted', 'chess-playing', 'nerds', 'out', 'battle', 'Cold', 'War', 'dollars', 'ingenuity', 'Hanks', 'Hoffman', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'tall', 'indomitable', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'Texas', 'heiress', 'intent', 'foiling', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Southern', 'Baptist', 'good', 'time', 'religion', 'international', 'influence', 'plenty', 'bucks', 'frou-frou', 'hair', 'Julia', 'what', 'best', '-creates', 'albeit', 'humorously', 'Julia', 'manikin', 'larger', 'life', 'stealing', 'scene', 'big', 'hair', 'big', 'teeth', 'sly', 'eyes', 'more', 'power', 'men', 'wrapping', 'little', 'finger', 'finesse', 'Hope', 'diamond.Bottom', 'line', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'story', 'how', 'Afghan', 'resistance', 'caged', 'mighty', 'Soviet', 'bear', 'covert', 'help', 'extremely', 'functional', 'triumvirate', 'consisting', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Mixing', 'two', 'parts', 'sex', 'three', 'parts', 'booze', '3oo', 'million', 'parts', 'black', 'appropriations', 'Molotov', 'cocktail', 'enough', 'Soviet', 'Mil', 'Mi-24', 'helicopters', 'moon', 'depicting', 'diplomacy', 'politics', 'humorous', 'implemental', 'best', 'Fast', 'fun', 'film', 'recommended', 'who', 'like', 'history', 'neat', 'beer', 'chaser.Diana', 'Faillace', 'Von', 'Behren', 'reneofc']",N/A

Don't remember anything about Charlie Wilson so was intrigued by the premise of this movie. The first time I borrowed the DVD from the local library (sorry Amazon but a movie has to be outstanding before I buy it), I had a hard time figuring out just what was going on and couldn't make much sense of this behind-the- scenes story. It was still fascinating to watch such unique characters (great acting especially Julia Roberts and Philip S Hoffman) and story unfold and the viciousness of this David vs Goliath war. I got the cd audiobook (again from the library!) and listened to the whole story which is just amazing. You cannot believe all the manipulating involved or how long it took to get the Russians out of the country. No wonder Afghanistans dislike Westerners. So this past weekend I again looked at the movie and got much more out of it. There's a lot of holes in the story line but it got the essence of the major players, the politicing involved and the war itself dead on. I rarely bother with bonus features on Dvd's finding them superfulous and/or redundant.

1144205,A1OMFPO9MA1GYS,B0013XZ2QA,Donald J. Keck,"[3, 4]","A first rate movie about the end game of the Cold War. This is the best film on the Cold War since ""The Company."" For once, Hollywood got it right about the consumate evil of ""the Evil Empire,"" and about how the good guys - after years of blundering and bumbling - finally brought it down.But the missing character in this movie is the man who really did bring the Soviet Empire to its knees - the man who finally abandoned the old, failed strategies of ""containment"" and ""detante"" and devised the strategy that won the Cold War by destroying the Soviet Union. And it was not Charlie Wilson. It was Ronald Wilson Reagan, whose name is not even mentioned in this movie.No doubt Charlie Wilson was a dedicated anti-communist. No doubt he was sincerely horrified by the very real atrocities committed by the Soviets in Afghanistan. No doubt he was instrumental in securing the Congressional funding needed to implement the Reagan administration's policy of supporting the Afghan resistance. But the strategy which led to the collapse of the Soviet Union (of which Afghanistan was only a part) was all Ronald Reagan's.The unspoken premise of this film is ridiculous. It is simply absurd to suppose - as this movie clearly does - that a Congrssman (however powerful) could run a private war against another nation out of his Congrssional office without the approval of the administration. Foreign policy and war making are the prerogatives and responsibility of the executive branch, not Congress - and certainly not a Congressional sub-committee. Congress can play a supporting, or (as we saw in Vietnam and Iraq) an obstructing role, but it can neither initiate nor manage a war.Congressman Wilson may have played an important role in supporting the Reagan administration's policy of actively opposing Soviet aggression in Afghanistan. But According to this film the Reagan administration played no role at all (at least none that is acknowledged); not even a supporting role in ""Charlie Wilson's War"" - the title tells it all.Ronald Reagan is simply airbrushed out of the picture the way Stalin had the enemies he liquidated removed from old photographs of the Soviet leadership in order to turn them into non-persons. Ronald Reagan is the non-person in this film.But perhaps that is the point of the movie - to expunge Reagan's legacy as the man who won the Cold War; to rewrite history by removing from the scene the most successful American President since the end of the Second World War.Nevertheless, in spite of this major flaw, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" remains one of the best films about the Cold War since Hollywood's big left turn in the 1960's - primarily for its remarkably clear eyed portrayal of the evils of Soviet totalitarianism.",4,Who Was Charlie Wilson?,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,2742,"['first', 'rate', 'movie', 'end', 'game', 'Cold', 'War', 'best', 'film', 'Cold', 'War', 'Company', 'once', 'Hollywood', 'got', 'right', 'consumate', 'evil', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'how', 'good', 'guys', 'years', 'blundering', 'bumbling', 'finally', 'brought', 'missing', 'character', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'bring', 'Soviet', 'Empire', 'knees', 'man', 'who', 'finally', 'abandoned', 'old', 'failed', 'strategies', 'containment', 'detante', 'devised', 'strategy', 'won', 'Cold', 'War', 'destroying', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'not', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'was', 'Ronald', 'Wilson', 'Reagan', 'name', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'movie.No', 'doubt', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'was', 'dedicated', 'anti-communist', 'doubt', 'was', 'sincerely', 'horrified', 'very', 'real', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Soviets', 'Afghanistan', 'doubt', 'was', 'instrumental', 'securing', 'Congressional', 'funding', 'needed', 'implement', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'policy', 'supporting', 'Afghan', 'resistance', 'strategy', 'led', 'collapse', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Afghanistan', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'was', 'Ronald', ""Reagan's.The"", 'unspoken', 'premise', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'simply', 'absurd', 'suppose', 'movie', 'clearly', 'Congrssman', 'however', 'powerful', 'could', 'run', 'private', 'war', 'nation', 'Congrssional', 'office', 'approval', 'administration', 'Foreign', 'policy', 'war', 'making', 'are', 'prerogatives', 'responsibility', 'executive', 'branch', 'not', 'Congress', 'certainly', 'not', 'Congressional', 'sub-committee', 'Congress', 'can', 'play', 'supporting', 'saw', 'Vietnam', 'Iraq', 'obstructing', 'role', 'can', 'neither', 'initiate', 'manage', 'war.Congressman', 'Wilson', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'important', 'role', 'supporting', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'policy', 'actively', 'opposing', 'Soviet', 'aggression', 'Afghanistan', 'According', 'film', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'played', 'role', 'least', 'none', 'acknowledged', 'not', 'even', 'supporting', 'role', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'title', 'all.Ronald', 'Reagan', 'simply', 'airbrushed', 'picture', 'way', 'Stalin', 'had', 'enemies', 'liquidated', 'removed', 'old', 'photographs', 'Soviet', 'leadership', 'order', 'turn', 'non-persons', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'non-person', 'film.But', 'perhaps', 'point', 'movie', 'expunge', 'Reagan', 'legacy', 'man', 'who', 'won', 'Cold', 'War', 'rewrite', 'history', 'removing', 'scene', 'most', 'successful', 'American', 'President', 'end', 'Second', 'World', 'War.Nevertheless', 'spite', 'major', 'flaw', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'Cold', 'War', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'left', 'turn', '1960', 'primarily', 'remarkably', 'clear', 'eyed', 'portrayal', 'evils', 'Soviet', 'totalitarianism']",N/A

He was the only civilian to ever receive recognition and honor by the C.I.A. for his part in helping to drive the Russians out from Afghanistan. This film is based on the true stories written by the author George Crile in his book, ""Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of How the Wildest Man in Congress and a Rogue CIA Agent Changed the History of Our Times"". Essentially, there are two formulas to win this war on a global scale: the first is, ""money + power = secret arms deals"" and the second is, ""clandestinely obtained weapons + motivated Afghani fighters = success"". Serendipity often comes into play when success occurs on a global scale and Charlie Wilson seemed to benefit both from the unexpected and unknown ...Charlie Wilson was sitting in a hot tub at Caesar's Palace with three young ladies, two of whom were strippers, and some male business partners, when he first saw Dan Rather on assignment in Afghanistan, presenting the plight of the mujahideen. Dan Rather described the difficulty they had fighting the Russians who had superior technology and arms. When he returned to Washington, he read the teletype from API, UPI, and Reuters and asked the C.I.A. how much was in their budget for clandestine operations in Afghanistan. He was told $5 million dollars, he quickly told them, ""double it"" [Charlie Wilson happened to be on the Senate Appropriations Committee]. From that point forward, Charlie Wilson was committed to helping free the Afghanistan people from Russian control ...Tom Hanks does a superb job in playing the role of Charlie Wilson. At some point, he was contacted by Joanne Herring (played to perfection by Julia Roberts) who is a wealthy socialite from Texas who recently became a 'born again' Christian. She knew President Zia, the Prime Minister of Pakistan and arranged for Charlie Wilson to meet this Pakistani leader. He pled his case that the Afghanistan fighters needed better weapons to fight the Russians. He wanted the US to provide weapons *but* wanted Parkistan to control their distribution. More than 1/5 of the population of Afghanistan had escaped across the border to Pakistan and lived in squalid conditions due to the war with the Russians. At another point in the film, Charlie Wilson had a visit from Gust Avratakos, a rather independently minded C.I.A. agent [which got him into hot water with his superiors] ... who also had a stake in helping free Afghanistan. These two unlikely partners dealt in secret deals and meetings with an Israeli weapons and arms agent. They obtained the needed Stinger anti-aircraft missles for the Afghani fighters to use against the Russian bombers which turned the war around completely. At some point in the film, Charlie Wilson had gotten political and economic support from Doc Long, another Senator who had strong religious beliefs. He committed his total support to Charlie Wilson's position in this war.While Charlie Wilson may be viewed as a flawed hero, he and Gust Avratakos single-handedly provided the weapons and arms needed by the mujahideen to win the war against the Russians. Amazingly enough, as time passed, the 10 million dollars initially committed to this clandestine venture turned into $500 million dollars. Few men can fund a pet program and spend money of this magnitude and get away with it. This film does a superb job of presenting the circumstances and particular events which showed how the nearly impossible became reality. In many ways and on many levels, the film presents events in too much of a simplistic and entertaining fashion, for which I deduct one star. No doubt, the book is more thorough and complete in providing the complex details which led to the success which Charlie Wilson and Gust Avratakos achieved. Nevertheless, this is a most enjoyable and well done film.

1144213,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B0013XZ2QA,Erik North,"[2, 2]","The Cold War hung over the heads of humanity for the best part of forty-five years, from the end of World War II in 1945 until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  And one of the central fronts in the Cold War was fought covertly in Afghanistan following the Soviet Union's incursion into that mountainous country on its southern border.  But one relatively obscure Texas congressman named Charlie Wilson helped to bring about the demise of that incursion.  That is the story told with incredible wit in the film CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR.Tom Hanks, the ever-reliable Everyman actor of our time, portrays Charlie Wilson, who, with his largely liberal credentials, has somehow been chosen to represent a congressional district in east Texas that leans politically to the right of Atilla The Hun.  He chooses to remain behind the scenes, indulging in his Congressional playboy life (and avoiding troubles with federal prosecutors).  But then the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan at the end of 1979 shakes him out of his complacency.  And goaded on by a wealthy Houston socialite (Julia Roberts) with right-wing proclivities, Hanks teams up with an avuncular and wryly profane CIA man (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to covertly arm the Afghan mujahadeen that has largely been unsuccessful at repelling the Soviet invasion.  Starting with a secretive budget of $5 million, Hanks and Hoffman go on a two-man crusade to somehow convince Israel, which has the largest stockpile of Soviet weaponry outside the Soviet Union itself, to sell arms to a group of people that would otherwise want the Jewish state wiped off the map.  The result is a highly enjoyable, incisive, and critical political satire the likes of which Hollywood has somehow largely been unable to do in the wake of 9/11, which, ironically enough, has its roots in the covert arming of the Afghan mujahadeen.CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR benefits from stellar performances by Hanks, Hoffman, and Roberts, a highly inventive and scatological screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing""; A FEW GOOD MEN), and is superbly directed by Mike Nichols, whose 1967 film THE GRADUATE remains a touchstone film in cinematic history.  It is a film of considerable relevance to our time, because it shows us how we may have won the Cold War without really trying...and then found ourselves stumbling into another war--again, without really trying.  Any film that can provoke discussion in this age of the War On Terror on issues that led us to where we are now has got a lot going for it.  And when done with such high-caliber talent, as has been done here in CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, the results are absolutely phenomenal.",5,How To Win A War...Without Really Trying,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,2646,"['Cold', 'War', 'hung', 'heads', 'humanity', 'best', 'part', 'forty-five', 'years', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', '1945', 'fall', 'Berlin', 'Wall', '1989', 'one', 'central', 'fronts', 'Cold', 'War', 'was', 'fought', 'covertly', 'Afghanistan', 'following', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'incursion', 'mountainous', 'country', 'southern', 'border', 'one', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'Texas', 'congressman', 'named', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'helped', 'bring', 'about', 'demise', 'incursion', 'story', 'told', 'incredible', 'wit', 'film', 'CHARLIE', 'WILSON', 'WAR.Tom', 'Hanks', 'ever-reliable', 'Everyman', 'actor', 'time', 'portrays', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'who', 'largely', 'liberal', 'credentials', 'somehow', 'been', 'chosen', 'represent', 'congressional', 'district', 'east', 'Texas', 'politically', 'right', 'Atilla', 'Hun', 'remain', 'scenes', 'indulging', 'Congressional', 'playboy', 'life', 'avoiding', 'troubles', 'federal', 'prosecutors', 'then', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'Afghanistan', 'end', '1979', 'shakes', 'complacency', 'goaded', 'wealthy', 'Houston', 'socialite', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'right-wing', 'proclivities', 'Hanks', 'up', 'avuncular', 'wryly', 'profane', 'CIA', 'man', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'covertly', 'arm', 'Afghan', 'mujahadeen', 'largely', 'been', 'unsuccessful', 'repelling', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'Starting', 'secretive', 'budget', '5', 'million', 'Hanks', 'Hoffman', 'go', 'two-man', 'crusade', 'somehow', 'convince', 'Israel', 'largest', 'stockpile', 'Soviet', 'weaponry', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'sell', 'arms', 'group', 'people', 'would', 'otherwise', 'want', 'Jewish', 'state', 'wiped', 'off', 'map', 'result', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'incisive', 'critical', 'political', 'satire', 'likes', 'Hollywood', 'somehow', 'largely', 'been', 'unable', 'do', 'wake', '9/11', 'ironically', 'enough', 'roots', 'covert', 'arming', 'Afghan', 'mujahadeen.CHARLIE', 'WILSON', 'WAR', 'benefits', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Hanks', 'Hoffman', 'Roberts', 'highly', 'inventive', 'scatological', 'screenplay', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'West', 'Wing', 'A', 'FEW', 'GOOD', 'MEN', 'superbly', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Nichols', '1967', 'film', 'THE', 'GRADUATE', 'touchstone', 'film', 'cinematic', 'history', 'film', 'considerable', 'relevance', 'time', 'how', 'may', 'have', 'won', 'Cold', 'War', 'really', 'trying', 'then', 'found', 'stumbling', 'war', 'again', 'really', 'trying', 'film', 'can', 'provoke', 'discussion', 'age', 'War', 'Terror', 'issues', 'led', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'got', 'lot', 'going', 'when', 'done', 'such', 'high-caliber', 'talent', 'been', 'done', 'here', 'CHARLIE', 'WILSON', 'WAR', 'results', 'are', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal']",N/A

This is one of the stupidest, most repulsive flicks that I turned off in a long time.

It looked to me like a botched job, the sort of film where the script writer, the director, and the producers couldn't get on the same page and so released a compromised product that satisfied nobody. It's odd to read the other reviews here on ammy; many of them grind political axes, but the radical right-wingers accuse the film of being leftist propaganda, while the liberals accuse it of being rightist deception. I'd be happier if it were clearly anything besides shallow, exploitative, and uncontextualized. It is fairly silly to offer this as a historical film based on a true story, and yet omit so many players in that story. My own views of the film's political obtuseness are more or less the same as those expressed in the review by Timothy Scanlon.Forgetting the issue of historical content, I have to say something about the film as drama. Tom Hanks is a great actor, but a dud in this role. He's too recognizable, of course, but beyond that, he's not plausible as Charlie Wilson, even the Charlie Wilson of the script. Take a look at the real Charlie Wilson, as shown in the bonus features; you'll see what I mean. The only outstanding acting in this film, as many others have stated, is done by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the role of the 'rogue' intelligence agent.If you have any broader base of information about events in Afghanistan in the decades from Carter to Bush, you may find this film painful. It's a bitter fact that the USA has stepped into the jackboots left on the field by the Russians in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

It is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a long time.  But, more importantly, it tells the true story of an important event in our recent history that many people don't know much about:  America's secret efforts to support the Mujahideen resistance forces in Afghanistan during the decade-long Soviet-Afghan war (1979-89).  If you have an interest in Cold War history, or if you want to better understand the background behind the current conflict in Afghanistan, you must watch this movie.  Tom Hanks does a brilliant job portraying Congressman Charlie Wilson, a colorful Texas Democrat with a reputation for being a playboy and one of the most ineffective members of Congress, who single-handedly orchestrated America's covert war in Afghanistan.  Julia Roberts is also spectacular in her role as an outspoken Texas socialite who was the chief lobbyist for America's involvement in Afghanistan.  But it is Philip Seymour Hoffman who steals the show with his portrayal of the gritty, curmudgeonly CIA officer who ran the operation in Afghanistan.  Other excellent performances come from Amy Adams (as Wilson's assistant), and Ned Beatty (as a senior member of Congress).

If the importance of the subject matter were not so enormous, then it would be an easy matter to just give this film a pass as an entertaining success... which in many ways it is. Perhaps the movie title could have been 'Charlie Wilson's Unfinished War' or 'How An Amateur Texas Politician Helped Send Several Billion Dollars Of Weapons Into A Region They Really Knew Nothing About Without Regard For The Consequences'. That's where the rub lies at the end, and it's presented as if we were a mere $1 million in school investments away from success, when of course we weren't.All of the performances are great, the dialoque is snappy, and the girls are beautiful. It's the end result and a couple of minutes of reflection that leaves the viewer a bit uneasy. In the bonus features the real life Joanne gives away the deeper motivations with her assessment of Soviet intentions, domino theory, and the risk to oil routes (as mentioned by Roberts in the film). Charlie is presented as a heroic film, but the larger aims and issues are far more complex than that. It would have been nice if the real Charlie would have gathered up all of the US donated guns, RPGs, missles and mines after 'mission accomplished' & before leaving office. Absolutely no mention is made of Bin Laden and company as beneficiaries, of course.

The screenplay is by Aaron Sorkin of "" The West Wing"" fame that is based on the book by George Crile about Democratic Congressman Charlie Wilson's covert efforts in the 1980's to aid the Afghan mujahaideen's fight against the Russians. Wilson was successful in getting Congressional subcommittees to increase funding for the war from five million dollars to one billion before the Russians were run out of Afghanistan.The acting here is first class. Hanks plays the happy-go-lucky Charlie Wilson who likes strippers and parties but is a patriot at heart. With his braces and cowboy boots, but more importantly, his sensitive eyes and facial expressions he becomes the character he portrays and is totally believable, even if you know nothing about Wilson himself, who was a consultant on the movie and recently underwent a successful heart transplant. Roberts with a lot of blonde hair is Joanne Herring, a Texas socialite, who hates communists and sometimes sleeps with Wilson. Being a proper Georgia girl and not wanting to bring her daddy to public shame she dons a bikini for this film but she's not about to do a nude scene. Hanks picks up the slack, however, as he appears in the altogether with strippers early on in the film. Philip Seymour Hoffman as a CIA agent is over the top. It is obvious that he can do anything since this role is a far cry from his Oscar winning role recently as the wincing Truman Capote.While the actors play this movie for laughs-- and there are plenty of them-- underneath the parties and bubble and hilarity, this film is as serious as stretch marks and scarier than watching the evening news. Wilson's whole endeavor, however, never made the news and raises the question that haunts many of us: what similar events may be being carried out by a few members of those who govern us and how long will it take to be uncovered, if ever?This movie is not to be missed.",5,Some Heavy Artillery Here,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,2182,"['theatres', 'just', 'time', 'Christmas', 'season', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominations', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'armed', 'heavy', 'artillery', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'place', 'including', 'director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'screenplay', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'West', 'Wing', 'fame', 'based', 'book', 'George', 'Crile', 'Democratic', 'Congressman', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'covert', 'efforts', '1980', 'aid', 'Afghan', 'mujahaideen', 'fight', 'Russians', 'Wilson', 'was', 'successful', 'getting', 'Congressional', 'subcommittees', 'increase', 'funding', 'war', 'five', 'million', 'dollars', 'one', 'billion', 'Russians', 'were', 'run', 'Afghanistan.The', 'acting', 'here', 'first', 'class', 'Hanks', 'happy-go-lucky', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'who', 'strippers', 'parties', 'patriot', 'heart', 'braces', 'cowboy', 'boots', 'more', 'importantly', 'sensitive', 'eyes', 'facial', 'expressions', 'character', 'totally', 'believable', 'even', 'know', 'nothing', 'Wilson', 'who', 'was', 'consultant', 'movie', 'recently', 'underwent', 'successful', 'heart', 'transplant', 'lot', 'blonde', 'hair', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'Texas', 'socialite', 'who', 'communists', 'sometimes', 'sleeps', 'Wilson', 'Being', 'proper', 'Georgia', 'girl', 'not', 'wanting', 'bring', 'daddy', 'public', 'shame', 'bikini', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'nude', 'scene', 'up', 'slack', 'however', 'altogether', 'strippers', 'early', 'film', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'CIA', 'agent', 'top', 'obvious', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'role', 'far', 'cry', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'recently', 'wincing', 'Truman', 'Capote.While', 'actors', 'play', 'movie', 'laughs', 'are', 'plenty', 'parties', 'bubble', 'hilarity', 'film', 'as', 'serious', 'stretch', 'marks', 'scarier', 'watching', 'evening', 'news', 'Wilson', 'whole', 'endeavor', 'however', 'never', 'made', 'news', 'question', 'many', 'what', 'similar', 'events', 'may', 'be', 'being', 'carried', 'out', 'few', 'members', 'who', 'govern', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'take', 'be', 'uncovered', 'ever', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

This story is based on what actually happened.The three main actors play people who are somewhat connivers, somewhat con artists. Charlie Wilson, for example, manipulated blacks to vote him into Congress. The ethics Committee wanted to charge him with consorting with prostitutes and taking drugs. Yet he wanted to do good. When he saw the harm that the Russians were doing to Afghanistan and its people in 1980, butchering them, he used his skills to start a covert war; that is, a war against Russia that was secret, not approved, using weapons secured by surreptitious means, weapons that did not come from the US. He persuaded Congress to up the CIA funding for the war to help the Afghans from five million to a billion dollars. He gave weapons to the Afghans that destroyed Russia's planes and tanks and caused Russia to leave Afghanistan.

DeMeo ""naturalenergyworks""","[10, 22]","Charlie Wilson was an important player in helping to rid Afghanistan of the Soviets, but history shows it was Ronald Reagan and his team, Bill Casey in the CIA, etc., who were the constant and most powerful organizing agents to send the missiles to shoot down Soviet helicopters, and who established policy directives to make the Soviets pay a high price for their invasion and barbarism in Afghanistan -- which was but one facet of the COMINTERN's push for world domination, of the Cold War. The movie doesn't go into this aspect, but that's typical Hollywood leftism, not to mention the 100 million victims of communist atrocity during the 20th Century.  A good summary article on this is ""Hollywood's Sins of Omission"" By: Dr. Paul Kengor, which can easily be found on internet.  Hollywood typically screws up history (just look at the seditious conduct of many top stars), either trying to make the Americans the bad-guys of history and current events, twisting history to make a celebrity star appear more heroic by making his enemy more villainous (as in Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"", where a British officer was falsely tarnished as a mass-murderer of civilians), Speilberg's inserting the obligatory American soldier machine-gunning captured German prisoners at Normandy (the reverse happened many times, in fact), or outright falsely claiming Americans accomplished things -- as with the rescuing of the Enigma machine from a captured Nazi U-boat -- which actually was an heroic mission pulled off by the British.  The lesson is, don't trust your history or current-events to Hollywood and the glamor-crowd.",2,"Should have been re-scripted and called ""Ronald Reagan's War""",1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1614,"['Charlie', 'Wilson', 'was', 'important', 'player', 'helping', 'rid', 'Afghanistan', 'Soviets', 'history', 'shows', 'was', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'team', 'Bill', 'Casey', 'CIA', 'etc.', 'who', 'were', 'constant', 'most', 'powerful', 'organizing', 'agents', 'send', 'missiles', 'shoot', 'down', 'Soviet', 'helicopters', 'who', 'established', 'policy', 'directives', 'make', 'Soviets', 'pay', 'high', 'price', 'invasion', 'barbarism', 'Afghanistan', 'was', 'one', 'facet', 'COMINTERN', 'push', 'world', 'domination', 'Cold', 'War', 'movie', ""n't"", 'go', 'aspect', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'leftism', 'not', 'mention', '100', 'million', 'victims', 'communist', 'atrocity', '20th', 'Century', 'good', 'summary', 'article', 'Hollywood', 'Sins', 'Omission', 'Dr.', 'Paul', 'Kengor', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'found', 'internet', 'Hollywood', 'typically', 'up', 'history', 'just', 'look', 'seditious', 'conduct', 'many', 'top', 'stars', 'either', 'trying', 'make', 'Americans', 'bad-guys', 'history', 'current', 'events', 'twisting', 'history', 'make', 'celebrity', 'star', 'appear', 'more', 'heroic', 'making', 'enemy', 'more', 'villainous', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Patriot', 'where', 'British', 'officer', 'was', 'falsely', 'tarnished', 'mass-murderer', 'civilians', 'Speilberg', 'inserting', 'obligatory', 'American', 'soldier', 'machine-gunning', 'captured', 'German', 'prisoners', 'Normandy', 'reverse', 'happened', 'many', 'times', 'fact', 'outright', 'falsely', 'claiming', 'Americans', 'accomplished', 'things', 'rescuing', 'Enigma', 'machine', 'captured', 'Nazi', 'U-boat', 'actually', 'was', 'heroic', 'mission', 'pulled', 'off', 'British', 'lesson', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'history', 'current-events', 'Hollywood', 'glamor-crowd']",N/A

1144239,A140XH16IKR4B0,B0013XZ2QA,Jean E. Pouliot,"[1, 1]","""Charlie Wilson's War"" is a terrific adaptation of George Crile's book of the same title, depicting the small and unlikely group of men and women who managed to bring America's covert might to bear on the Soviets in Afghanistan. The story focuses on Charlie Wilson, roue Texas Congressman, Gust Avrakotos, rogue CIA agent and Joanne Herring, wealthy Texas socialite. All, for their own reasons, decide that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is not good for American interests, and conspire, seemingly without the blessing or knowledge of the rest of the government, to supply the Afghan mujaheddin with the weapons they need to knock down the fearsome and lethal Soviet Hind helicopters. Tom Hanks turns in an almost-great performance as the likable but irrepressible Wilson, who when not sneaking new appropriations past his congressional colleagues, lives in a blurry world a women and booze and maybe harder fare. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as the coarse and vulgar Avrakotos, a man blocked by his non-Wasp ethnicity from career advancement. Roberts is only so-so as Herring -- more eye-candy than tough broad.As much as the movie celebrates the Cold War attitude of sticking it to the Russians, by the end it did a creditable job of critiquing the American habit of liberating people, then walking away. As we now know, the mujaheddin we armed and trained in the 1980s morphed into the Taliban of today. We often fight the same weapons we gleefully poured into that fractious country decades earlier. Gust describes this conundrum with a parable about a boy -- whose alternating excitement and dejection over his changing fortune are met with the mantra ""We'll see"" from a wise and far-seeing Zen Master.I enjoyed the extras, which featured interviews with the real-life Charlie Wilson and Joan Herring, though not with Avrakotos, who died in 2005, two years before the movie was released. ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is exhilarating good fun, shows how stuff sometimes gets done in politics, lifts up the value of the individual and offers a sobering lesson on the limitations of power.",5,2 guys (and a gal) who booted the Russkies out of Afghanistan,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,2096,"['Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'terrific', 'adaptation', 'George', 'Crile', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'depicting', 'small', 'unlikely', 'group', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'managed', 'bring', 'America', 'covert', 'might', 'bear', 'Soviets', 'Afghanistan', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'roue', 'Texas', 'Congressman', 'Gust', 'Avrakotos', 'rogue', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'wealthy', 'Texas', 'socialite', 'own', 'reasons', 'decide', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'Afghanistan', 'not', 'good', 'American', 'interests', 'conspire', 'seemingly', 'blessing', 'knowledge', 'rest', 'government', 'supply', 'Afghan', 'mujaheddin', 'weapons', 'need', 'knock', 'down', 'fearsome', 'lethal', 'Soviet', 'Hind', 'helicopters', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'almost-great', 'performance', 'likable', 'irrepressible', 'Wilson', 'who', 'when', 'not', 'sneaking', 'new', 'appropriations', 'congressional', 'colleagues', 'lives', 'blurry', 'world', 'women', 'booze', 'maybe', 'harder', 'fare', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'wonderful', 'coarse', 'vulgar', 'Avrakotos', 'man', 'blocked', 'non-Wasp', 'ethnicity', 'career', 'advancement', 'Roberts', 'only', 'so-so', 'Herring', 'more', 'eye-candy', 'tough', 'broad.As', 'much', 'movie', 'Cold', 'War', 'attitude', 'sticking', 'Russians', 'end', 'did', 'creditable', 'job', 'critiquing', 'American', 'habit', 'liberating', 'people', 'then', 'walking', 'away', 'now', 'know', 'mujaheddin', 'armed', 'trained', '1980s', 'morphed', 'Taliban', 'today', 'often', 'fight', 'same', 'weapons', 'gleefully', 'poured', 'fractious', 'country', 'decades', 'earlier', 'Gust', 'conundrum', 'parable', 'boy', 'alternating', 'excitement', 'dejection', 'changing', 'fortune', 'are', 'met', 'mantra', ""'ll"", 'see', 'wise', 'far-seeing', 'Zen', 'Master.I', 'enjoyed', 'extras', 'featured', 'interviews', 'real-life', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'Joan', 'Herring', 'not', 'Avrakotos', 'who', 'died', '2005', 'two', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'exhilarating', 'good', 'fun', 'how', 'stuff', 'sometimes', 'done', 'politics', 'up', 'value', 'individual', 'sobering', 'lesson', 'limitations', 'power']",N/A

Marren ""jtm497""","[1, 3]","""Charlie Wilson's War"" tells the largely unknown (until now) story of America's aid to the guerillas during the Afghan war against the Soviet Union.Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of How the Wildest Man in Congress and a Rogue CIA Agent Changed the History of Our TimesWith hindsight, we wonder at how we could have been so foolish as to arm the very people who were responsible for 9/11 many years later, but the picture at the time looked a bit different. The USSR was waging a one-sided war with helicopters against tribal peoples armed with WWI rifles. Wilson, an old-school wheeler-dealer, calls in his chits, uses his plum committee assignments, and manages to get the financing for arms, and then calls on the Pakistanis to help get the arms to the Afghans. The USSR's loss was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union.Given the subject matter, the movie is quite entertaining, with Tom Hanks as the hard drinking, fast living Congressman, and Julia Roberts as the Texas socialite with brains who gets him involved. Actually, I found the all-star cast distracting. Wilson is an interesting character, and the movie does little to explore what really drove him to get involved. We get a glimpse of his lonely, almost pathetic life--who was this guy, really? Joanne Herring, a virulent anti-Communist and passionate Christian, is also intriguing, but I couldn't get past seeing Julia Roberts in a stiff blonde wig.Happily, Philip Seymour Hoffman saves the day as a rogue CIA agent who executes Charlie's covert operation. Too much of a renegade to get promoted within the system, bored with his assignments, but with impeccable credentials and contacts, Hoffman drives the strategy. We all know, unfortunately, how it turned out. The film is worth seeing, if only to drive home how we repeat the mistakes of the past again and again.",4,Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. . . .,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,1856,"['Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'largely', 'unknown', 'now', 'story', 'America', 'aid', 'guerillas', 'Afghan', 'war', 'Soviet', 'Union.Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'Extraordinary', 'Story', 'How', 'Wildest', 'Man', 'Congress', 'Rogue', 'CIA', 'Agent', 'Changed', 'History', 'TimesWith', 'hindsight', 'wonder', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'foolish', 'arm', 'very', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', '9/11', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'picture', 'time', 'looked', 'bit', 'different', 'USSR', 'was', 'waging', 'one-sided', 'war', 'helicopters', 'tribal', 'peoples', 'armed', 'WWI', 'rifles', 'Wilson', 'old-school', 'wheeler-dealer', 'chits', 'plum', 'committee', 'assignments', 'get', 'financing', 'arms', 'then', 'Pakistanis', 'help', 'get', 'arms', 'Afghans', 'USSR', 'loss', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'Soviet', 'Union.Given', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'hard', 'drinking', 'fast', 'living', 'Congressman', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Texas', 'socialite', 'brains', 'who', 'involved', 'Actually', 'found', 'all-star', 'cast', 'distracting', 'Wilson', 'interesting', 'character', 'movie', 'little', 'explore', 'what', 'really', 'drove', 'get', 'involved', 'get', 'glimpse', 'lonely', 'almost', 'pathetic', 'life', 'who', 'was', 'guy', 'really', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'virulent', 'anti-Communist', 'passionate', 'Christian', 'also', 'intriguing', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'seeing', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'stiff', 'blonde', 'wig.Happily', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'day', 'rogue', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'Charlie', 'covert', 'operation', 'Too', 'much', 'renegade', 'get', 'promoted', 'system', 'bored', 'assignments', 'impeccable', 'credentials', 'contacts', 'Hoffman', 'strategy', 'know', 'unfortunately', 'how', 'turned', 'out', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'drive', 'home', 'how', 'repeat', 'mistakes', 'past', 'again', 'again']",N/A

Charlie Wilson's War is based on a true story.  It is proof that, in this country at least, one caring, determined man can make a difference to the world.This is a fast paced story, based on real events of the early 1980s.  Essentially, Texas' colorful 2nd District US Congressman, in just 7 years, enables Afghanistan to be the first country to defeat the Russian Army, signaling the beginning of the end of the Cold War.This film has an outstanding cast, all of whom deliver strong, believable performances.  Tom Hanks is true standout, playing Charlie Wilson to a tee, depicting him in full-blown real life with all of his flaws and foibles, as well as his patriotism, big heart, determination, and guts.  Julia Roberts is excellent as a wealthy Texas society woman who is used to getting what she wants.  Philip Seymour Hoffman truly amazing as the CIA agent on Charlie's side. His comic timing is superlative, making you laugh out loud.  Amy Adams is beautiful as always as Wilson's much put upon administrative aide. The entire supporting cast is top notch.The script is just plain fantastic.  It teaches us as well as being extremely entertaining.  The dialogue is interesting and witty, and it rings true.  The story is told with a host of emotions from plain amusement to sheer horror.  The viewer becomes invested in this story and these people.I highly recommend this film.

Driscoll,"[3, 5]","I try not to get caught up in the historical accuracy of films like this but if the film were overly critical or not critical enough you wouldn't hear such a wide range of opinions on the story's portrayal of these real life characters.  Simply put, some of Reagan's guys thought this was dishonest, some thought it was just right.  This is a good movie and given not so much the historical accuracy, but the historical context of its consequences, it was worth telling. Did Charlie Wilson unwittingly arm the Taliban?  Is he still a hero for it?  Nevertheless, as compelling as the film is in terms of the subject's modern consequences, its ultimate goal may not have been political at all, but to simply provide a look into some of the politics of the time and to showcase several outstanding performances.  Hollywood veteran Mike Nichols (The Graduate,Silkwood) directs and Tom Hanks stars in and produces the film.  Aaron Sorkin adapts the George Crilebookeffectively and you would think Sorkin's politics would be easier to detect, but I found the film to be relatively non-partisan.For those who don't already know, Charlie Wilson was a Democratic Texas Congressman, who worked with a rogue-ish CIA agent to help fund the Mujahideen resistance in order to undermine the Soviet Union in their war with Afghanistan.  This was dubbed Operation Cyclone and eventually lead to the Soviet Union's withdrawal from an Afghanistan and its government that would succumb to the resistence several years later.  The film follows Charlie Wilson closely as he makes decisions that lead to these significant events.  The conclusion seems to be highlighted by Wilson's apparent regrets in not being able to successfully raise support for the post-Soviet chaos of civil war that would follow.  So in some ways we're the bad guys by not doing anything other than help blow things up I guess.  Well, there are your shades of modern political parallels I suppose.All of that aside, the thing that makes Charlie Wilson's War a very good film are its performances.  Not just of Phillip Seymour Hoffman who was nominated for an Oscar in his supporting role, but also for Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.  Amy Adams and others are also very strong but it's the interactions between Hanks's Wilson, Hoffman's CIA agent Gust, and Roberts's Joanne Herring that make the film work.  Their performances coupled with Sorkin's fantastic screenplay make the film as surprisingly humorous as the subject is interesting. Nichols has been at the controls for too many good films not to get the credit he deserves as well.  I enjoyed every scene of this film for reasons I really didn't expect going in.  Well-adapted real-life characters and actors who take their delivery very seriously.",4,Great Showcase for Top Level Performances,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,2755,"['try', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'films', 'film', 'were', 'overly', 'critical', 'not', 'critical', 'enough', 'would', ""n't"", 'hear', 'such', 'wide', 'range', 'opinions', 'story', 'portrayal', 'real', 'life', 'characters', 'Simply', 'put', 'Reagan', 'guys', 'thought', 'was', 'dishonest', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'good', 'movie', 'given', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'historical', 'context', 'consequences', 'was', 'worth', 'telling', 'Did', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'unwittingly', 'Taliban', 'still', 'hero', 'Nevertheless', 'as', 'compelling', 'film', 'terms', 'subject', 'modern', 'consequences', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'political', 'simply', 'provide', 'look', 'politics', 'time', 'showcase', 'several', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Hollywood', 'veteran', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Graduate', 'Silkwood', 'directs', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'stars', 'film', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'George', 'Crilebookeffectively', 'would', 'think', 'Sorkin', 'politics', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'detect', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'relatively', 'non-partisan.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'was', 'Democratic', 'Texas', 'Congressman', 'who', 'worked', 'rogue-ish', 'CIA', 'agent', 'help', 'fund', 'Mujahideen', 'resistance', 'order', 'undermine', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'war', 'Afghanistan', 'was', 'dubbed', 'Operation', 'Cyclone', 'eventually', 'lead', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'withdrawal', 'Afghanistan', 'government', 'would', 'succumb', 'resistence', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'closely', 'decisions', 'lead', 'significant', 'events', 'conclusion', 'be', 'highlighted', 'Wilson', 'apparent', 'regrets', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'successfully', 'raise', 'support', 'post-Soviet', 'chaos', 'civil', 'war', 'would', 'follow', 'So', 'ways', ""'re"", 'bad', 'guys', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'other', 'help', 'blow', 'things', 'up', 'guess', 'Well', 'are', 'shades', 'modern', 'political', 'parallels', 'suppose.All', 'aside', 'thing', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'are', 'performances', 'Not', 'just', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'supporting', 'role', 'also', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'others', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'strong', 'interactions', 'Hanks', 'Wilson', 'Hoffman', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Gust', 'Roberts', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'performances', 'coupled', 'Sorkin', 'fantastic', 'screenplay', 'make', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'humorous', 'subject', 'interesting', 'Nichols', 'been', 'controls', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'films', 'not', 'get', 'credit', 'as', 'well', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'film', 'reasons', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'going', 'Well-adapted', 'real-life', 'characters', 'actors', 'who', 'take', 'delivery', 'very', 'seriously']",N/A

Wow!Directed by Mike Nichols, starring Tom Hanks in the lead role and Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a supporting role as a maverick CIA agent this film is certainly entertaining.  We meet Charlie Wilson living a rather controversial life as a hard-drinking, hard partying congressman.  At first he seems a lightweight.  But, as the story moves along, we see that he is really concerned about the people of Afghanistan and wants to help.  Enter Julia Roberts, cast as a rich conservative Texas beauty who is dedicated to politics.  She and Hanks soon have the screen steaming and he is convinced that there must be some way to get arms to the freedom fighters of Afghanistan.  Eventually, through some Israeli connections, the arms are supplied, the Russians are pushed out and that, as they say is history.Yes, history.  But this film was made in 2007.  And so the filmmakers wisely have the characters talk about what looks like the right thing at one time might not be the right thing at another time.  This is good foreshadowing of what we all know what happened later with the Taliban and 911.I really enjoyed this film.  It was well paced and there was humor throughout.

He likes women and they are always around him.  He is also deeply patriotic and understands the plight of people with odds stacked against them.(""Charlie Wilson"" - who I had not heard of - is best known for ""leading Congress into supporting Operation Cyclone, the largest-ever CIA covert operation which supplied the Afghan Mujaheddin during the Soviet war in Afghanistan."")Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a smart but undervalued CIA agent (Gust Avrakotos).

But something else other than wet areolas catches Charlie's eagle eye. Up on the mounted television set behind the bar is an unshaven Dan Rather of CBS Evening News reporting from the deserts of Afghanistan. A local woman who speaks English tells a turbaned Dan that &#34;America is asleep...&#34; and that if the Russians invade her country - the Gulf is next - and after that - the USA itself. Charlie (Tom Hanks) politely declines an offer to make a tasteful TV Movie with Playboy of the Month and her naked agent for $29,000 and bids them all farewell...Back at his office in Texas (which oddly enough is peopled with three large-chested women sporting buttons in their blouses that can't seem to be closed) - Charlie makes enquiries with his assistant Bonnie (Amy McAdams) into the covert ops budget for the dirt-country in the Middle East with no real political friends (America included). He doesn't like what he hears and as a Congressman for the House of Representatives - he determines to change all that nonsense by doubling its budget from five million dollars to ten. And so it begins...Along the way Charlie meets with the 6th wealthiest woman in Texas - the wildly patriotic and determined sexpot Joanne Herring (a stunning Julia Roberts eating up a proper role) and a Greek CIA operative Gust Avrakotos (another genius portrayal from the greatly missed Philip Seymour Hoffman) who has anger issues with his bosses and hasn't been killed across 4 continents in 24 years by people who know how to (dialogue above). So far so funny...But then it all changes when Charlie visits Afghanistan itself - and sees up close and personal what the Russian war machine is doing to defenceless Muslims. Men are being stacked in human piles and then run over by tanks as their wives are made to watch - children are dismembered with toy mines - and starving people rush grain trucks ripping open sacks in desperation. And as he walks up a hill and looks back at a Biblical scene of refugee tents with huge expanses of humanity being hammered by bullyboys - Charlie sheds a tear. And then a steely look enters his angry gaze...What makes &#34;Charlie Wilson's War&#34; so good is a trio of things - the alarming and often ridiculous nature of this true modern-war story - a wickedly funny and yet touching Aaron Sorkin script - and a huge posse of Grade-A actors capable of making you chuckle one moment then shed a tear the next. The three principal leads are exceptional - especially Hanks and Hoffman - but there's also quality support from Emily Blunt, Om Puri, John Slattery, Ned Beatty, Ken Stott and Peter Gerety in small but significant roles.The characters they portray may at times seem utterly ridiculous, meddlesome and even arrogant - but their convictions and above all their love of democracy and freedom knows no bounds. And anything that threatens that (i.e.: murderous Russians slaughtering easy pickings like peasants with pitchforks and old rifles) - is going to get short shift - and high-tech weaponry if that doesn't work.The problem with all this 'movie entertainment' is that it clouds an obvious and stinging question - why did the CIA arm the Afghans? To give them their country back  - or out of pure self-interest - they get to defeat the Soviets using another country and another people to do it? The film doesn't shirk this thorn to its credit - offering up the plausible response that it was probably a bit of both. And it also points out that in the mid Nineties the American Government lost interest once the war was won and shamefully left with the goal achieved but the 'people' stranded - not investing - not rebuilding - and thereby giving rise to massive Islamic hated towards the West - which of course has had global consequences ever since.The BLU RAY picture quality is gorgeous throughout - a major production - and filmed in Full Aspect (1.85:1)  - you get that punch of quality across the whole screen and in every shot. Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Spanish Surround 5.1. Subtitles are in English SDH, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Korean, Latin American Spanish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish, Thai, Turkish and Traditional Mandarin.Directed by Mike Nichols and adapted from George Crile's book by Aaron Sorkin - &#34;Charlie Wilson's War&#34; seems slight at first - but then bites into your heart - and leaves you mightily impressed.Did Texas Mascara and a Congressman with etched leather boots (elected to the Ethics Committee when he was clearly a dubious choice for the job) actually bring the Soviet Empire to its knees and defeat Communism?

The film portrays that Wilson's intentions were noble.

Some of them  are also  now some of the same men that Western troops in Afghanistan have to contend with.  There is controversy that Osama Bin Laden may have been one of the ""freedom fighters"" during the 1980's.

Based on what I know about the real Charlie Wilson, I think the movie takes some liberties with the truth, but I suppose that is to be expected.

It would read as a very overblown Frederick Forsyth or John Grisham novel. As it is, the whole thing bears repeat watching very well.The dialogue is really very sharp in places, and the slight element of bad language is artistically justified for once.

But that's Washington, D.C., for you. In a way, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" could almost be considered an American ""Schindler's List,"" recast as a drawing-room (or smoke-filled back room) comedy. Tom Hanks' Wilson, like Oscar Schindler, is a high-living wheeler-dealer; at the beginning of Aaron Sorkin's sharply witty screenplay, he uses his office as U.S. Representative for the Second Congressional District of Texas as an excuse to re-enact ""Boogie Nights."" But Wilson, like Schindler, also has a social conscience, and soon it is raised in the cause of the oppressed Afghan people fighting a losing battle against Soviet occupation. Before long, Wilson is using his considerable backroom negotiating skills to ensure the Afghans are fighting a winning battle. Wilson is aided and abetted in particular by two people just as unlikely as he: Jo Anne Herring (Julia Roberts), a wealthy right-wing Christian activist who doesn't let her beliefs curtail her enthusiasm for double martinis and consorting (socially and otherwise) with liberal Democrats like Wilson, and Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a schlubby, tart-tongued, but brilliant CIA operative who isn't averse to smashing a few plate-glass windows to get people's attention.

1144275,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0013XZ2QA,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""Charlie Wilson's War"" is based on George Crile's 2003 book of the same name which tells the story of irreverent Texan Congressman Charlie Wilson's campaign to equip the mujaheddin rebels who were fighting the Soviet army in Afghanistan in the 1980s. After seeing television coverage of the ill-equipped, underfunded mujaheddin, Rep. Wilson (Tom Hanks) doubled the paltry $5 million US aid to the rebels. This caught the attention of Texas socialite and anti-communist crusader Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), who used her considerable clout to persuade Wilson to take up the cause. With the help of CIA agent Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a frustrated 24-year-veteran of the Cold War, Wilson was able to supply anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons to the mujaheddin and increase US aid to as astonishing $500 million per year.This might be a dry tale if the characters weren't so colorful. Charlie Wilson becomes concerned with the plight of the mujaheddin while soaking in a hot tub in Las Vegas with a couple of strippers and a Playboy model. He is under investigation for narcotics use by none other than Rudolph Giuliani while trying to organize aid to Afghan rebels. The man liked to sow his wild oats. Gust Avrakotos is an odd combination of idealist and cynic who introduced himself by bugging Wilson's Scotch bottle. Joanne Herring is an ultra-right-wing fashion plate, who uses her charm and wealth to get her way, even with the liberal Democratic Congressman. Together, these three people changed US policy in Afghanistan and armed the guerilla's who dealt the Soviet Army its first defeat, delivering an economic blow that facilitated the USSR's collapse.Wilson, Avrakotos, and Herring are a lot of fun to watch, because they never attempt to conceal what they are. Like them or not, these are strong, direct personalities. Charlie Wilson is a genuine, fun-loving guy, not the least bit worried about his image, who makes this story as funny as it is remarkable. Joanne Herring is the first good role Julia Roberts has had since her younger, smiley romantic comedy days. I question the film's implication that the US did not have a coherent policy in Afghanistan before Charlie Wilson came along, however. The ""bleed"" policy was carefully conceived, and someone must have explained it to Wilson and Herring at some point, even if Wilson's approach turned out to be better. Director Mike Nichols delivers a very entertaining, mainstream film that is nonetheless provocative and revealing of the machinations on Capitol Hill.The DVD (Universal 2008): ""The Making of Charlie Wilson's War"" (17 min) interviews director Mike Nichols, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, and the cast about the script and about the real Charlie Wilson, who is also interviewed, along with Joanne Herring. ""Who Is Charlie Wilson?"" (12 min) interviews Mike Nichols, Tom Hanks, and others about Charlie Wilson. Charlie Wilson talks about his position in Congress, how he became involved in getting arms to the mujaheddin, and his view of them. Some archive footage from the 1980s is included.

The movie tells the (based on true) story of the Texas Congressman who played a pivotal role in getting substantial funding to the Mujahedin in Afghanistan, eventually leading to the forced withdrawal of the Russians, thereby paving the way for the downfall of the Soviet Empire - as told by this movie at least.  The interesting part is that Charlie Wilson was a womanizing party animal who was the last person many would have thought would tackle this issue.The cast fit the bill perfectly - Tom Hanks surprises as the drinking Congressman, sharing a hot tub with strippers doing coke.. but retains the naivete that seems to have allowed him to say `why not' when faced with the question of increasing funds to Afghan freedom fighters.  The woman asking the questions is a rich, headstrong Texan woman played by Julia Roberts, and the man in the CIA actually getting the job done and providing the technical explanations, is played by Philip Seymour Hoffman.It's shot well, in bright colours and plenty of lighting so we never have a dark moment, and acting is perfectly fine throughout.  There is even just a touch of acknowledgement at the end that things were not so straightforward, and a warning that with the Russians gone, and without funding rebuilding infrastructure and schools, the `crazies' would inevitably take the leading role.  As of course they did.On the downside, this is really a very superficial look at the issues, and a rather one-sided look at events in history.

1144282,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B0013XZ2QA,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[2, 2]","If my dear Amazonian, you read no further than this sentence, know this:  Charlie Wilson's War starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Tom Hanks, and Julia Roberts (in order of best performances turned in mind you) as real world characters in what was really a war is a good flick...get it, watch it.This movie, which is a very excellent movie, raises several important questions and issues.  The first of which is that Tom Hanks sure looks better with a fuller head of hair than the one he sported in Da Vinci's Code and plays a much better Texas politician run morally playboy amuck trying to oust the Soviets from a little country called Afghanistan than he plays a crazy religious cryptologist that cracks the secrets of King Arthur's chalice or was it Jesus' last supper cup?  Either way, Jesus, that Da Vinci code movie was not quite right and this little flick is a highly recommended view.  Jesus, go get it now.  Well not you Jesus because you'd probably rent the movie from Blockbuster or some place like that, because you know like you save and all, Jesus. But you Amazonian reading this...you're the one who should get this movie.  It's good, really it is.Evidently what I learned from the movie is that there is this real country called Afghanistan somewhere on the other side of the world and wars happen there all the time.  The British tried to occupy the place and they got rousted by the tribal locals in a bad bad way.  The Soviets also tried to occupy the place and then this religious nut job rich socialite from Houston up and decided Jesus told her to get the Mujahedeen some shoulder launched SAMS to knock those Hinds out of the sky and that was the way God needed to win the cold war.  What?  That sounds crazy but then so was the cold war and so are religious nut jobs from Texas and now from Pakistan or Saudi or Afghanistan for that matter.So, evidently Charlie Wilson is from Texas' fifth district, a congressman who largely ran his office and his life like a scene out of Howard Stern's ""Private Parts,"" and got converted to the cause of humanity by viewing a refugee camp in the largely unregulated border area in Pakistan called Waziristan and witnessed the lovely things mines can do.  Granted the Soviets were probably a little harsher than most modern armys in the way they conducted their war but war is hell or so they say and yet it goes on day by day.  I don't think it would be a spoiler for this movie to tell you that the Soviets eventually got kicked out of Afghanistan and this Houston rich lady was largely responsible.  Now those Mujahedeen have re-named themselves the Taliban and Al Qaeda and are doing the same thing they've done for the last 100 years or so, trying to kick a foreign presence out of their country so they can get back to growing poppy fields and keeping their country pristine of roads and pavement and McDonald's and Starbucks.  Oh, the tangled webs we weave.  Someone should write a book on it, eh?So Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing a renegade CIA agent is the real treat here.  The man is a brilliant actor, let's face it.

1144283,AZGQV8SQLULCI,B0013XZ2QA,M.W. Thrasher,"[3, 3]","A fantastic movie on all levels. Not only are the performances sleek and inspired, but there is a refreshing element of everydayness that makes the whole account watchable and enjoyable while retaining its seriousness. The gravity of the whole issue is not allowed to weigh the movie down, and the cheekiness of the presentation does not trivialise any of its messages. A perfect balance has been struck that delivers its message loud and clear.It is important to notice that this movie transcends partisanship by extending itself into the real world. Specifically, the movie lacks an ending; even though it follows the war of the Afghan nation against the Soviets, showing how the US got involved, all the way to the defeat of the Soviets and even slightly beyond that, it stops there and does not follow through. And here lies the genius of this movie, simple and laconic: it gives us no ending. There in no proper ending to this movie, for the ending is out there, in the real world. We are actually left to understand the turn of events on our own, through the aftereffects of what the movie has shown happen twenty years ago, and to make up our minds as such. We are left to close the movie up with our own personal experience of the repercussions of what happened out there, and we are left to do it on our own and without lectures or cheesy endings.And the best part of all is that when the DVD is released in a few months time, we will still have an ending for Charlie Wilson's War. While this may make this movie difficult to comprehend in its entirety, say, fifty years from now, it makes it perfectly relevant now, and allows the real world to explain the movie, just as this movie tries to explain the real world. Brilliant reciprocity. What a way to make a statement. Even if the events are not entirely comprehensive, it's a great statement to make. Great storytelling. An effective way to touch a nerve or two. It'll incite hot questions and make an individual realise that defending democracy involves more than just arms. It involves brains, balls, vision, and an appreciation of the bigger picture, which were unfortunately absent in this tremendous case. And so not only was the monumental opportunity of fanning the winds of democracy and modernity in a medievally-functioning country squandered, but they were also tragically reversed into a backdraft that is now burning away right in front of our faces, inside our pockets, and down our children's future.Charlie Wilson's War shows us exactly how idealism, zealotry, business-making, or just plain hype, can turn from blessing in disguise to an acrimonious curse, and may have a thing or two to teach us... if we take a little time after the movie is over and look around a bit.",5,The picture just got bigger,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,2751,"['fantastic', 'movie', 'levels', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'performances', 'sleek', 'inspired', 'refreshing', 'element', 'everydayness', 'whole', 'account', 'watchable', 'enjoyable', 'retaining', 'seriousness', 'gravity', 'whole', 'issue', 'not', 'allowed', 'weigh', 'movie', 'down', 'cheekiness', 'presentation', 'not', 'trivialise', 'messages', 'perfect', 'balance', 'been', 'struck', 'message', 'loud', 'clear.It', 'important', 'notice', 'movie', 'partisanship', 'extending', 'real', 'world', 'Specifically', 'movie', 'ending', 'even', 'war', 'Afghan', 'nation', 'Soviets', 'showing', 'how', 'US', 'got', 'involved', 'way', 'defeat', 'Soviets', 'even', 'slightly', 'there', 'not', 'follow', 'here', 'genius', 'movie', 'simple', 'laconic', 'ending', 'proper', 'ending', 'movie', 'ending', 'there', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'actually', 'left', 'understand', 'turn', 'events', 'own', 'aftereffects', 'what', 'movie', 'shown', 'happen', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'make', 'up', 'minds', 'such', 'are', 'left', 'close', 'movie', 'up', 'own', 'personal', 'experience', 'repercussions', 'what', 'happened', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'left', 'do', 'own', 'lectures', 'cheesy', 'endings.And', 'best', 'part', 'when', 'DVD', 'released', 'few', 'months', 'time', 'will', 'still', 'have', 'ending', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'may', 'make', 'movie', 'difficult', 'comprehend', 'entirety', 'say', 'fifty', 'years', 'now', 'perfectly', 'relevant', 'now', 'real', 'world', 'explain', 'movie', 'just', 'movie', 'explain', 'real', 'world', 'Brilliant', 'reciprocity', 'What', 'way', 'make', 'statement', 'Even', 'events', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'comprehensive', 'great', 'statement', 'make', 'Great', 'storytelling', 'effective', 'way', 'touch', 'nerve', 'two', ""'ll"", 'incite', 'hot', 'questions', 'make', 'individual', 'realise', 'defending', 'democracy', 'more', 'just', 'arms', 'brains', 'balls', 'vision', 'appreciation', 'bigger', 'picture', 'were', 'unfortunately', 'absent', 'tremendous', 'case', 'so', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'monumental', 'opportunity', 'fanning', 'winds', 'democracy', 'modernity', 'medievally-functioning', 'country', 'squandered', 'were', 'also', 'tragically', 'reversed', 'backdraft', 'now', 'burning', 'away', 'right', 'front', 'pockets', 'down', 'children', 'future.Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'exactly', 'how', 'idealism', 'zealotry', 'business-making', 'just', 'plain', 'hype', 'can', 'turn', 'blessing', 'disguise', 'acrimonious', 'curse', 'may', 'have', 'thing', 'two', 'teach', 'take', 'little', 'time', 'movie', 'look', 'around', 'bit']",N/A

1144286,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B0013XZ2QA,Newton Ooi,"[3, 3]","George Crile of 60 Minutes authored the book ""Charlie Wilson's War"" to describe the role of Democratic Congressman Charlie Wilson in organizing the US support of the Afghan mujahadeen during the 1980's.  For such a important and entertaining book, it was never turned into a movie until after the events of 9/11.  Luckily, the movie makers assembled a talented cast of actors and actresses, starting with Tom Hanks to play Charlie Wilson.  Unfortunately, Hanks' physique and presence has no likeness to his character.  The dialogue is great though, with both comedy and tragedy interplayed quite well.The topic of the movie is quite complex, and engages a much wider cast of characters and subjects than even hinted at in this film.  Probably the biggest absence from the movie is the Reagan administration.  Wilson's war would have never gotten anywhere without the tacit approval (minimum) and cooperation of the White House.  Another key absence is the role of the opium trade.  A third key absence was the role of the US military-industrial complex.  Lobbyists from various US military suppliers played key roles both in D.C. and elsewhere to make Wilson's war happen.  Probably the biggest absence was any meaningful characterization of the Afghans themselves.  They are shown either as refugees, or as grateful receivers of American aid.  No mention of religious fundamentalism, rape and plunder, torture, or the cruelties of guerilla warfar.  Together, these absences downgrades this to a good 4-star movie, instead of a great 5-star classic.When the movie first debuted in December 2008, there were rumors that Charlie Wilson and other individuals used threats of legal action to keep key scenes of out of this movie.  I am not surprised.  Movies of such topics usually run over 2 hours; think JFK and Nixon by Oliver Stone, or The Insider, or Syriana.  Charlie Wilson's War was way under 2hours.  My bet was that the original movie was over 2hrs in length, but various scenes had to be cut out to keep the lawsuits away.  This is unfortunate, as such an important topic as the Afghan War needs a full and complete treatment.  Overall, a good movie, but it lacks the depth and breadth needed to place it among the pantheon of great political thrillers.",4,"Brisk, funny, but probably incomplete",1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,2260,"['George', 'Crile', '60', 'Minutes', 'authored', 'book', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'describe', 'role', 'Democratic', 'Congressman', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'organizing', 'US', 'support', 'Afghan', 'mujahadeen', '1980', 'important', 'entertaining', 'book', 'was', 'never', 'turned', 'movie', 'events', '9/11', 'Luckily', 'movie', 'makers', 'assembled', 'talented', 'cast', 'actors', 'actresses', 'starting', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'play', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'Unfortunately', 'Hanks', 'physique', 'presence', 'likeness', 'character', 'dialogue', 'great', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'interplayed', 'quite', 'well.The', 'topic', 'movie', 'quite', 'complex', 'much', 'wider', 'cast', 'characters', 'subjects', 'even', 'hinted', 'film', 'Probably', 'biggest', 'absence', 'movie', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'Wilson', 'war', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'gotten', 'anywhere', 'tacit', 'approval', 'minimum', 'cooperation', 'White', 'House', 'key', 'absence', 'role', 'opium', 'trade', 'third', 'key', 'absence', 'was', 'role', 'US', 'military-industrial', 'complex', 'various', 'US', 'military', 'suppliers', 'played', 'key', 'roles', 'D.C.', 'elsewhere', 'make', 'Wilson', 'war', 'happen', 'Probably', 'biggest', 'absence', 'was', 'meaningful', 'characterization', 'Afghans', 'are', 'shown', 'either', 'refugees', 'grateful', 'receivers', 'American', 'aid', 'mention', 'religious', 'fundamentalism', 'rape', 'plunder', 'torture', 'cruelties', 'guerilla', 'warfar', 'Together', 'absences', 'downgrades', 'good', '4-star', 'movie', 'instead', 'great', '5-star', 'classic.When', 'movie', 'first', 'debuted', 'December', '2008', 'were', 'rumors', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'other', 'individuals', 'used', 'threats', 'legal', 'action', 'keep', 'key', 'scenes', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'Movies', 'such', 'topics', 'usually', 'run', 'over', '2', 'hours', 'think', 'JFK', 'Nixon', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Insider', 'Syriana', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'was', 'way', '2hours', 'bet', 'was', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'over', '2hrs', 'length', 'various', 'scenes', 'had', 'be', 'cut', 'out', 'keep', 'lawsuits', 'away', 'unfortunate', 'such', 'important', 'topic', 'Afghan', 'War', 'full', 'complete', 'treatment', 'Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'depth', 'breadth', 'needed', 'place', 'pantheon', 'great', 'political', 'thrillers']",N/A

The move is based on the true story of the covert U.S. war in Afghanistan in the 1980's, when America was trying to prop up the Afghan government and run the Soviets out of the country.After Joanne, a rich and beautiful constituent (Roberts) impresses the gravity of the Afghan situation upon Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson (Hanks), he finds himself with a desire to help. Over the next several years, Charlie authorizes millions of U.S. dollars to quietly flow into Afghan armament and training, recruiting none other than Israel to help source weapons untraceable to America.The armament is successful, allowing Afghan troops to defeat the Soviets and drive them from the country. However, when further funding (in a much smaller amount) is then needed for infrstructure/rebuilding, Charlie is unable to marshall the support required to appropriate additional dollars. Everyone is ""over"" the Afghan war.I thought the movie started incredibly slowly (though folks who enjoy seeing Hanks hot tub with naked starlets might think it was the most AWESOME. THING. EVER.). It took a little while for me to begin caring about the story. However, once Charlie attends a swanky fundraiser at Joanne's house, the viewer begins to understand how all of the pieces might come together.There are several notable angles to this story:1.) Charlie is the most unlikely of supporters for a strictly Muslim nation. He's a heavy drinker. He's an unabashed womanizer. He loves a good time. He's more thoroughly unprincipled, even by Western standards, than most.2.) Charlie doesn't seem to really be a ""mover and shaker"" in D.C. However, he sits at the nexus of two committees uniquely positioned to appropriate funds for covert actions.3.) The plan works. 'Nuff said. As Charlie is quoted at the end of the movie - the endgame (rebuilding the country) is where everything fell to pieces.Performances are uniformly good in this. Hanks, as always, is rock solid. (There's an awesome scene between Hanks and Hoffman at the end of the film, with the two characters discussing ""victory"" on a balcony. Both are priceless. Hanks' face speaks volumes in this scene.)Worth seeing.",3,Good time Charlie turns humanitarian,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,2247,"['Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'move', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'covert', 'U.S.', 'war', 'Afghanistan', '1980', 'when', 'America', 'was', 'trying', 'prop', 'up', 'Afghan', 'government', 'run', 'Soviets', 'country.After', 'Joanne', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'constituent', 'Roberts', 'gravity', 'Afghan', 'situation', 'Texas', 'Congressman', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'Hanks', 'desire', 'help', 'next', 'several', 'years', 'Charlie', 'millions', 'U.S.', 'dollars', 'quietly', 'flow', 'Afghan', 'armament', 'training', 'recruiting', 'none', 'other', 'Israel', 'help', 'source', 'weapons', 'untraceable', 'America.The', 'armament', 'successful', 'allowing', 'Afghan', 'troops', 'defeat', 'Soviets', 'drive', 'country', 'However', 'when', 'further', 'funding', 'much', 'smaller', 'amount', 'then', 'needed', 'infrstructure/rebuilding', 'Charlie', 'unable', 'marshall', 'support', 'required', 'appropriate', 'additional', 'dollars', 'Everyone', 'Afghan', 'thought', 'movie', 'started', 'incredibly', 'slowly', 'folks', 'who', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Hanks', 'hot', 'tub', 'naked', 'starlets', 'might', 'think', 'was', 'most', 'AWESOME', 'THING', 'EVER.', 'took', 'little', 'while', 'begin', 'caring', 'story', 'However', 'once', 'Charlie', 'swanky', 'fundraiser', 'Joanne', 'house', 'viewer', 'understand', 'how', 'pieces', 'might', 'come', 'are', 'several', 'notable', 'angles', 'story:1', 'Charlie', 'most', 'unlikely', 'supporters', 'strictly', 'Muslim', 'nation', 'heavy', 'drinker', 'unabashed', 'womanizer', 'good', 'time', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'unprincipled', 'even', 'Western', 'standards', 'most.2', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'be', 'mover', 'shaker', 'D.C', 'However', 'nexus', 'two', 'committees', 'uniquely', 'positioned', 'appropriate', 'funds', 'covert', 'actions.3', 'plan', ""'Nuff"", 'said', 'Charlie', 'quoted', 'end', 'movie', 'endgame', 'rebuilding', 'country', 'where', 'everything', 'fell', 'pieces.Performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'good', 'Hanks', 'always', 'rock', 'solid', 'awesome', 'scene', 'Hanks', 'Hoffman', 'end', 'film', 'two', 'characters', 'discussing', 'victory', 'balcony', 'are', 'priceless', 'Hanks', 'face', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'scene', 'seeing']",N/A

Kellner ""PAK""","[0, 0]","""Charlie Wilson's War"" directed by Mike Nichols and starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.1979: Texas congressman Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is milking political life for all it's worth. Charlie is regularly invited to parties thrown by people who hope to court favor with him for his priceless vote in congress and Charlie is only too happy to join in the festivities regardless of whether he intends to follow his host's recommendation. Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) a wealthy right wing socialite has a cause of her own that she would like Wilson to become involved in. After a casual (and I mean very casual) first meeting, Wilson decides to look into the Afghanistan situation for Herring and finds it to be very interesting indeed. A brief look at the leadership heading up the situation lets Charlie know the situation is anything but well in hand. With some help from his new found friend from the CIA Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) Charlie sets out to influence the dire situation of the Afghani's as they face heavy Russian opposition...""Charlie Wilson's War"" was actually a very pleasant surprise for me. I went in with low expectations because my first impression of the movie from the trailer wasn't an appealing one coupled with the fact that I have never been a Julia Roberts fan. Low and behold a very interesting and entertaining movie unfolded before me that also reveals a little bit of political history although I cant say how accurately history has been re-told.The Good: The story was very good from start to finish. I don't know how accurately Tom Hanks (or the story) reflected the actual person Charlie Wilson or the events, but his take provided a very interesting character. The dynamic between his and his co-stars Roberts' and Hoffman's characters was great.The Bad: Nothing memorable for me. Some nudity and drug use may be offensive for those with sensitive eyes.Overall: Great movie. Check out ""Charlie Wilson's war.",4,4 1/2!

This film fully delivers that.  Hard-partying congressman Charlie Wilson, played by Tom Hanks, is introduced to the difficulties encountered by the Afghan people as they struggle to fight off the much more powerful Soviet Union.  Resolving to help them, Wilson, with the aid of CIA Agent Gust Avrakotos, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and on-again/off-again lover Joanne Herring, played by Julia Roberts, introduces new measures to aid the Middle East in their struggles to fight off communism.  This is a story that definitely isn't found in those high school history books and this film tells it beautifully.  The cast, especially Hanks, Roberts, and Hoffman, all come together and really get into the historic figures they are portraying on the big screen.  And to anyone who disputes the historical accuracy of this film, I'm positive artistic license was taken here and there.  That's fine...the movie theater and your DVD player aren't schools...watch this film and, if you want, go do more research on the subject matter.

1144296,A1THEQV9LKFN35,B0013XZ2QA,racapowski,"[3, 14]","There's a curious question at the heart of ""Charlie Wilson's War"": why?  No, not ""why, in the post-9/11 era, would someone make a movie praising a politician for giving financial assistance to what would become the Taliban, at least without a heck of a lot of explanation?"".  I mean, why was Charlie Wilson so driven to intervene in this particular conflict?  Even in the scene depicting his first spark of interest in Afghanistan, the movie doesn't really give a reason for Charlie's passion beyond ""Dan Rather's on the TEEVEE wearin' a TURBAN.""  But BEHOLD!  I have used SCIENCE! to deduce the real reason for Charlie's involvement, all from the first 15 minutes of the movie.- OK, I didn't bat an eye at the opening bit, with Charlie in the hot tub with two topless strippers, even though the breasts are being shown off with embarrassingly faux nonchalance, like the coworker who really wants you to notice his new Rolex.- The scene, though, then moves to Charlie's office, where Charlie's uniformly young and luscious assistants are dressed like a soft-porn parody of ""Mad Men.""  A visitor inquires about the dress code, whereupon he's told that Charlie reasons ""he can teach 'em to type, but he can't teach 'em to grow a pair of tits.""  The only person who objects to these hiring practices is quickly revealed to be a corrupt lobbyist who wants to bribe Charlie into illegal intervention in a court case.- After this meeting, we cut to the other lobbyist waiting in Charlie's office, who's dressed like a sexy librarian stereotype.  After she appraises Charlie's retinue, we in the next scene see her stripped down and about to have sex with Charlie in an attempt to get her bill passed, because that's how women _should_ participate in politics.  (She's also smoking weed, in an attempt to shock us with congressmen who smoke weed.  Yawwwwwwwwwn.)- Following a couple minutes of intrigue on the Afghanistan front, the action moves to the estate of a weathly madam who is auctioning off the services of sexy co-eds who're dressed in the slave Leia costume from ""Return of the Jedi"" about three years too early.  The cover story is that they'll wash your cars, though the real promise is to have them wash a bit more than that, if you get the movie's embarrassingly obvious drift.Anyhow, Pimp Julia Roberts enters and dismissively orders head receptionist Amy Adams, who's traveled there with her boss, to fetch her a couple martinis.  Amy Adams explains with Amy Adams sweetness that she's Charlie's employee, thinking that she's been mistaken for one of the visiting co-eds, whereupon Roberts ho-slaps her with an acrid ""well, isn't that _SPECIAL._  I take TWO olives.""  Ha ha!  That'll teach the dumb ho to work while having a pair of tits!  Unfortunately, I couldn't tell you what happened in the rest of the movie, on account of my fist being through the TV.Back to my thesis, though: so, yes, I find it completely plausible that Charlie Wilson attempted to form a Coalition of the Meatheaded with the Taliban in an effort to revert women to their God-given status as decorative toys for men.  I imagine ol' Charlie'll be bummed when he finds out about the whole burqa thing, but good compromises leave everyone mad.Really, though: there's a difference between being a stud and wanting to take any woman who aspires to being something more than a sex toy and throw her face in a blender.  This film doesn't get that, and so in its attempts to establish itself as a cheeky comedy about an affable womanizer, we instead get this steady drumbeat of ""women exist to polish knobs, and anyone who objects to this idea is UPTIGHT and hates us for our freedom.""

Charlie Wilson is an obscure congressman from Texas whose office is saturated with young female assistants seemingly ditzy but highly loyal to him; he is well connected with people of (financial) means and powerul social network.  Charlie is a smart goofball - man who is astute is ways of holding (his political) power, but who also likes to get his share of fun: drugs, girls and a good glass of drink.  When Charlie's lover, Texas socialite, becomes interested in stopping Russian invasion in Afganistan, Charlie becomes involved with CIA, Texas political powerhouse players, organizations promoting Middle East self-interest and self-preservation as well as Christian fundamentalist groups.  The genious of Charlie's political move is that his initial $5M war game becomes $1B enterprise in a covert war fully funded by the United States and its allies who like to play quietly in the background.

Still, his performance as the titular hero of ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is so good that even my long-standing dislike of the man's acting style is quashed, Hanks is excellent and so is this movie.The plot, briefly, concerns Wilson,  a small-time good-time U.S. Senator, whose covert efforts to fund the war in Afghanistan against the Russians in the early eighties raise a billion dollars in unofficial weaponry and training. He's aided in his quest to help the Afghanis by faithful secretary Bonnie Bach (""Enchanted""s delightful Amy Adams, in fine form), Texas devout Christian socialite and sometime-consort Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), and Gust Avrokotos (Philip Seymour-Hoffman), a grizzled, experienced CIA Agent.Performances in this movie are all top-drawer, with Hanks and Seymour-Hoffman having the kind of instantly believable screen chemistry that makes their exchanges a pleasure to watch. Roberts' role is quite small, but she plays it well; Hanks himself gives a likeable and accomplished turn as Charlie Wilson, and Philip Seymour-Hoffman's work here proves once again why he's such an important actor - he steals the show, but does it without resorting to corniness or mugging for the audience.The script is fantastic, Adam Sorkin's screenplay is witty and literate, and straightforward enough so that even people (like me!) who have difficulty retaining political information for more than thirty seconds will feel drawn in and compelled to find out how Charlie Wilson's War plays out.Direction is good, Mike Nichols is usually more interesting than this, but then, with such a good script and such excellent character portrayals by such fine actors, there's no need for directorial showiness: ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is extremely watchable without any extra help.Wholeheartedly recommended as one of the better Big Movies to come out of Hollywood recently, and a nicely lighthearted look at the Political Drama genre, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" gives you the ""I'm watching a really good movie"" feeling in spades, and doesn't disappoint - the ending comes fast and seems a bit rushed (I, for one, could have done with seeing a little more of the post-war fallout), but the vast, vast majority of this tale is well-made, well-told and absolutely worth watching.",4,Surprisingly enjoyable,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,2456,"['not', 'often', 'come', 'away', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'feeling', 'entertained', 'scale', 'one', 'ten', 'one', 'being', 'Carrot', 'Top', 'ten', 'being', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', ""'d"", 'rank', 'Hanks', 'three', 'Still', 'performance', 'titular', 'hero', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'so', 'good', 'even', 'long-standing', 'dislike', 'man', 'acting', 'style', 'quashed', 'Hanks', 'excellent', 'so', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'briefly', 'concerns', 'Wilson', 'small-time', 'good-time', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'covert', 'efforts', 'fund', 'war', 'Afghanistan', 'Russians', 'early', 'eighties', 'raise', 'billion', 'dollars', 'unofficial', 'weaponry', 'training', 'aided', 'quest', 'help', 'Afghanis', 'faithful', 'secretary', 'Bonnie', 'Bach', 'Enchanted', 's', 'delightful', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'fine', 'form', 'Texas', 'devout', 'Christian', 'socialite', 'sometime-consort', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Gust', 'Avrokotos', 'Philip', 'Seymour-Hoffman', 'grizzled', 'experienced', 'CIA', 'Agent.Performances', 'movie', 'are', 'top-drawer', 'Hanks', 'Seymour-Hoffman', 'having', 'kind', 'instantly', 'believable', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'exchanges', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Roberts', 'role', 'quite', 'small', 'well', 'Hanks', 'likeable', 'accomplished', 'turn', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'Philip', 'Seymour-Hoffman', 'work', 'here', 'once', 'again', 'why', 'such', 'important', 'actor', 'show', 'resorting', 'corniness', 'mugging', 'audience.The', 'script', 'fantastic', 'Adam', 'Sorkin', 'screenplay', 'witty', 'literate', 'straightforward', 'enough', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'difficulty', 'retaining', 'political', 'information', 'more', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'will', 'feel', 'drawn', 'compelled', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'out.Direction', 'good', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'usually', 'more', 'interesting', 'then', 'good', 'script', 'such', 'excellent', 'character', 'portrayals', 'such', 'fine', 'actors', 'need', 'directorial', 'showiness', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'extremely', 'watchable', 'extra', 'help.Wholeheartedly', 'recommended', 'one', 'better', 'Big', 'Movies', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'recently', 'nicely', 'lighthearted', 'look', 'Political', 'Drama', 'genre', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', ""'m"", 'watching', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'feeling', 'spades', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'ending', 'fast', 'bit', 'rushed', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'seeing', 'little', 'more', 'post-war', 'fallout', 'vast', 'vast', 'majority', 'tale', 'well-made', 'well-told', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

I've given it a second star only because there is - credit where it's due - excellent characterization, witty scripting, and superior production values. But as a ""history"" of the Afghan War or Congressman Wilson's involvement therein, it's disingenuous pablum.Wilson was not merely some disinterested observer undergoing an epiphany at sight of so much human suffering in the border refugee camps.  He was a knowing and conscious CIA cutout, with a track record of Middle East involvement on behalf of Israel and East Texas oilmen.  He raised money the old-fashioned pork barrel way to circumvent restrictions on the Agency; thus avoiding the kind of flak dished out to Oliver North who circumvented Congress as well.  Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts' character) was no mere overly-religious society matron, bleeding for the Afghans' struggle for freedom of faith; but rather a full-fledged member of the religious New Right, out to enforce its own fundamentalist Taliban morality on American society.The premise that it was the Afghan ""muj"" and their Stingers that broke the Red Army, which in turn ""caused"" the collapse of the USSR, is the film's essential and nonsensical theme.  The decay of said regime began before the Afghan War - indeed, the war's very launching was a symptom of that decay, much as Chechnya for the successors of Moscow.  To the real-life Wilson, supporting the Afghans was payback for Vietnam.  Feeding the Afghan War - as with the Contras, or Jonas Savimbi of Angola - was part of the Reagan strategy of creating ""two, three many Vietnams"" and, if not rolling back Red forces, at least bleeding them white.  Encouraging this war to continue, rather than attempting to settle it, did no service to the Afghans whom Wilson allegedly wept for.The film tries to cover its loose postwar ends by portraying US ""abandonment"" of the Afghans; implying that if ""America had stayed the course"" (like Iraq, presumably) then none of the ensuing problems there would be pestering us now.  Wilson of all people should knew that Afghanistan - like Nicaragua, like Angola - was a mere means to an end. It was on that pragmatic basis that he ""sold"" the war in the first place.  It had served its purpose.  That the US is now taking the role of the Soviet military is as ironic as the film's portrayal of those soldiers: we're treated to a lengthy setup of a Russian helicopter pilot sneering his contempt for traditional morality (like any good Red atheist or Hollywood glitterati) when he's kaboomed by a Stinger to the joyous wonderment of muj on the ground.  We'll never see such fundamentalist joy on US screens directed at secular US personnel, of course.  If Charlie Wilson's War was payback for Vietnam, then the current imbroglio can be seen as payback for CWW.  This film's gloating is doubtless designed to cover that odiously loose end as well.",2,Utter Bollox,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,2931,"['film', 'dishonest', 'hypocritical', 'manipulative', ""'ve"", 'given', 'second', 'star', 'only', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'excellent', 'characterization', 'witty', 'scripting', 'superior', 'production', 'values', 'history', 'Afghan', 'War', 'Congressman', 'Wilson', 'involvement', 'therein', 'disingenuous', 'pablum.Wilson', 'was', 'not', 'merely', 'disinterested', 'observer', 'undergoing', 'epiphany', 'sight', 'so', 'much', 'human', 'suffering', 'border', 'refugee', 'camps', 'was', 'knowing', 'conscious', 'CIA', 'cutout', 'track', 'record', 'Middle', 'East', 'involvement', 'behalf', 'Israel', 'East', 'Texas', 'oilmen', 'raised', 'money', 'old-fashioned', 'pork', 'barrel', 'way', 'circumvent', 'restrictions', 'Agency', 'thus', 'avoiding', 'kind', 'flak', 'dished', 'Oliver', 'North', 'who', 'circumvented', 'Congress', 'well', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'character', 'was', 'mere', 'overly-religious', 'society', 'matron', 'bleeding', 'Afghans', 'struggle', 'freedom', 'faith', 'rather', 'full-fledged', 'member', 'religious', 'New', 'Right', 'enforce', 'own', 'fundamentalist', 'Taliban', 'morality', 'American', 'society.The', 'premise', 'was', 'Afghan', 'muj', 'Stingers', 'broke', 'Red', 'Army', 'turn', 'caused', 'collapse', 'USSR', 'film', 'essential', 'nonsensical', 'theme', 'decay', 'said', 'regime', 'began', 'Afghan', 'War', 'indeed', 'war', 'very', 'launching', 'was', 'symptom', 'decay', 'much', 'Chechnya', 'successors', 'Moscow', 'real-life', 'Wilson', 'supporting', 'Afghans', 'was', 'payback', 'Vietnam', 'Feeding', 'Afghan', 'War', 'Contras', 'Jonas', 'Savimbi', 'Angola', 'was', 'part', 'Reagan', 'strategy', 'creating', 'two', 'three', 'many', 'Vietnams', 'not', 'rolling', 'back', 'Red', 'forces', 'least', 'bleeding', 'white', 'Encouraging', 'war', 'continue', 'rather', 'attempting', 'settle', 'did', 'service', 'Afghans', 'whom', 'Wilson', 'allegedly', 'wept', 'for.The', 'film', 'tries', 'cover', 'loose', 'postwar', 'ends', 'portraying', 'US', 'abandonment', 'Afghans', 'implying', 'America', 'had', 'stayed', 'course', 'Iraq', 'presumably', 'then', 'none', 'ensuing', 'problems', 'would', 'be', 'pestering', 'now', 'Wilson', 'people', 'should', 'knew', 'Afghanistan', 'Nicaragua', 'Angola', 'was', 'mere', 'end', 'was', 'pragmatic', 'basis', 'sold', 'war', 'first', 'place', 'had', 'served', 'purpose', 'US', 'now', 'taking', 'role', 'Soviet', 'military', 'as', 'ironic', 'film', 'portrayal', 'soldiers', ""'re"", 'treated', 'lengthy', 'setup', 'Russian', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'sneering', 'contempt', 'traditional', 'morality', 'good', 'Red', 'atheist', 'Hollywood', 'glitterati', 'when', 'kaboomed', 'Stinger', 'joyous', 'wonderment', 'muj', 'ground', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'such', 'fundamentalist', 'joy', 'US', 'screens', 'directed', 'secular', 'US', 'personnel', 'course', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'was', 'payback', 'Vietnam', 'then', 'current', 'imbroglio', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'payback', 'CWW', 'film', 'gloating', 'doubtless', 'designed', 'cover', 'odiously', 'loose', 'end', 'as', 'well']",N/A

It's a quasi-autobiographical story about how Representative Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) successfully toppled communism by secretly funding aid to Afghanistan.Now because communism is a bygone relic, much like 8 tracks and rotary phones, the filmmakers had a critical task laid before them.How were they going to make this film interesting to a majority of holiday audiences? I had personally liked Lions for Lambs, but other people must have felt that it was too serious because it lacked a strong box office showing.So, while keeping inferences to current-day events (and ethical questions) the production team behind this film settled on a formula of emphasizing what would work. They decided to dramatize the true story of a bible belt congressman who did everything and anything which some of his constituents still might be surprised to learn about.And it certainly didn't hurt the screenplay's laugh quotient that they 'just' happened to pick a politician who certainly was not politically correct. Staffing his offices with 'beauty queen' types whose clerical skills were questionable, the guy certainly was never like any of the people I've ever worked for and with. Still, his heart was in the right place.Julia Roberts also gives a commanding performance as Joanne Herring,a rich anti-communist right-winger loving to throw parties--as much as Charlie loves attending them. Like Charlie, Joanne is an expert politician, those oft-promoted morals get thrown out the window when Charlie needs a bed partner; she doesn't need to be forced. This character is based on a real life person of the same name from Houston Texas, although I am not sure how much was fact and how much was the fiction of Hollywood. Whether it was intentional or not, it did make me think about what many off-screen new right women really go through in order to obtain their public access.War is a serious subject, but with so much of it permeating the media and the economy not being where it ideally should be, this film declares 'war' on the holiday slump.",5,Charlie aids our holiday season,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,2121,"[""'m"", 'generally', 'sucker', 'political-themed', 'films', 'one', 'exception', 'quasi-autobiographical', 'story', 'how', 'Representative', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'successfully', 'toppled', 'communism', 'secretly', 'funding', 'aid', 'Afghanistan.Now', 'communism', 'bygone', 'relic', 'much', '8', 'tracks', 'rotary', 'phones', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'critical', 'task', 'laid', 'them.How', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'film', 'interesting', 'majority', 'holiday', 'audiences', 'had', 'personally', 'liked', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'other', 'people', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'serious', 'lacked', 'strong', 'box', 'office', 'showing.So', 'keeping', 'inferences', 'current-day', 'events', 'ethical', 'questions', 'production', 'team', 'film', 'settled', 'formula', 'emphasizing', 'what', 'would', 'work', 'decided', 'dramatize', 'true', 'story', 'bible', 'belt', 'congressman', 'who', 'did', 'everything', 'anything', 'constituents', 'still', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'learn', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'screenplay', 'laugh', 'quotient', ""'just"", 'happened', 'pick', 'politician', 'who', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'Staffing', 'offices', ""'beauty"", 'queen', 'types', 'clerical', 'skills', 'were', 'questionable', 'guy', 'certainly', 'was', 'never', 'people', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'worked', 'Still', 'heart', 'was', 'right', 'place.Julia', 'Roberts', 'also', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'rich', 'anti-communist', 'right-winger', 'loving', 'throw', 'parties', 'as', 'much', 'Charlie', 'attending', 'Charlie', 'Joanne', 'expert', 'politician', 'oft-promoted', 'morals', 'get', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'when', 'Charlie', 'bed', 'partner', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'forced', 'character', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'person', 'same', 'name', 'Houston', 'Texas', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'fact', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'fiction', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'intentional', 'not', 'did', 'make', 'think', 'what', 'many', 'off-screen', 'new', 'right', 'women', 'really', 'go', 'order', 'obtain', 'public', 'access.War', 'serious', 'subject', 'so', 'much', 'permeating', 'media', 'economy', 'not', 'being', 'where', 'ideally', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'holiday', 'slump']",N/A
1144314,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0013XZ2QA,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 11]","In 1980, Charlie Wilson was an obscure Texas congressman, more notable for his folksy manner and serial womanizing than for any legislative accomplishments.  Until, that is, he became actively involved in getting Congress to covertly fund some badly needed weapon shipments to the Afghani freedom fighters - also known as the Mujahadim - in their battle against the Soviet invaders.  It was these arms, particularly the anti-aircraft guns, that helped to turn the tide of the war in the Afghanis' favor and made them the only force in history to defeat the Soviet army.  Wilson was greatly inspired by a wealthy, right-wing socialite by the name of Joanne Herring who took up the Afghani's cause almost as a personal crusade.Though glitzy and superficial at times, Mike Nichols' ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" based on the book by George Crile, is a generally entertaining romp thanks to the performances of its mega-watt stars, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and to the breezy, crackling dialogue by scenarist Aaron Sorkin, of TV's ""West Wing"" fame.  Hanks has rarely seemed as confident and commanding in a role as he is here, and Roberts clearly relishes playing a woman who is both icily elegant and strangely vulnerable at one and the same time.  In their sizzling scenes together, the two old pros conjure up memories of some of the great screen couples of the past like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, Myrna Loy and William Powell who knew what it meant to be movie stars and could convey that larger-than-life quality on screen.These virtues more than compensate for the film's tendency to oversimplify the political and historical issues of the times and for a somewhat disjointed quality in the story's structure.  Despite the generally light-hearted tone of the piece, the movie ends on an admirably sober note, showing how what was initially seen as a triumph for American foreign policy might in actuality have been the catalyst for the events that would culminate in 9/11 (the sound of an airliner roaring overhead near the end of the film seems to foreshadow that seminal event).In contrast to some of the year's earlier, more heavy-handed (yet also more substantive) political dramas, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is one social studies lesson that goes down easy - though it should be noted that ""War,"" with its big-name stars, lighter tone, and safer, less topical subject matter, earns fewer points for audacity and courage than those others do.",4,an old-fashioned star vehicle,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,2512,"['1980', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'was', 'obscure', 'Texas', 'congressman', 'more', 'notable', 'folksy', 'manner', 'serial', 'womanizing', 'legislative', 'accomplishments', 'became', 'actively', 'involved', 'getting', 'Congress', 'covertly', 'fund', 'badly', 'needed', 'weapon', 'shipments', 'Afghani', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'also', 'known', 'Mujahadim', 'battle', 'Soviet', 'invaders', 'was', 'arms', 'particularly', 'anti-aircraft', 'guns', 'helped', 'turn', 'tide', 'war', 'Afghanis', 'favor', 'made', 'only', 'force', 'history', 'defeat', 'Soviet', 'army', 'Wilson', 'was', 'greatly', 'inspired', 'wealthy', 'right-wing', 'socialite', 'name', 'Joanne', 'Herring', 'who', 'took', 'up', 'Afghani', 'cause', 'almost', 'personal', 'crusade.Though', 'glitzy', 'superficial', 'times', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'based', 'book', 'George', 'Crile', 'generally', 'entertaining', 'romp', 'thanks', 'performances', 'mega-watt', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'breezy', 'crackling', 'dialogue', 'scenarist', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'TV', 'West', 'Wing', 'fame', 'Hanks', 'rarely', 'seemed', 'confident', 'commanding', 'role', 'here', 'Roberts', 'clearly', 'playing', 'woman', 'who', 'icily', 'elegant', 'strangely', 'vulnerable', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'sizzling', 'scenes', 'together', 'two', 'old', 'pros', 'conjure', 'up', 'memories', 'great', 'screen', 'couples', 'past', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'William', 'Powell', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'movie', 'stars', 'could', 'convey', 'larger-than-life', 'quality', 'screen.These', 'virtues', 'more', 'compensate', 'film', 'tendency', 'oversimplify', 'political', 'historical', 'issues', 'times', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'quality', 'story', 'structure', 'generally', 'light-hearted', 'tone', 'piece', 'movie', 'admirably', 'sober', 'note', 'showing', 'how', 'what', 'was', 'initially', 'seen', 'triumph', 'American', 'foreign', 'policy', 'might', 'actuality', 'have', 'been', 'catalyst', 'events', 'would', 'culminate', '9/11', 'sound', 'airliner', 'roaring', 'overhead', 'end', 'film', 'foreshadow', 'seminal', 'event', '.In', 'contrast', 'year', 'earlier', 'more', 'heavy-handed', 'yet', 'also', 'more', 'substantive', 'political', 'dramas', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'one', 'social', 'studies', 'lesson', 'down', 'easy', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'War', 'big-name', 'stars', 'lighter', 'tone', 'safer', 'topical', 'subject', 'matter', 'fewer', 'points', 'audacity', 'courage', 'others', 'do']",N/A

Tom Hanks does an excellent job as Charlie Wilson but the star performance goes to Hoffman who plays the CIA agent.  There is no attempt to portray Wilson as heroic or to minimize his sleaze.  Perhaps the best and most realistic scene in the film is the audience with Prsident Zia.  This is a short scene but very blunt and to the point.  It is followed by the watershed event which is the visit to the refugee camp.  From this point on the film sort of coasts to its climax, which is the withdrawal of the mighty Red Army.The issue I have with this film is its narrowness.  It fails to give any reason for the incursion by the Russians other than raw Imperialism.  It fails to show the Mujahadeen for what they truly were radical Islamofascists rather than the freedom fighters portrayed.  General Zia has a small role but the fact that he himself was a radical Muslim who introduced Sharia Law as the law of the land is ignored. The fact that he laid the foundation for subsequent events in Afghanistan by his radical Islamic beliefs and pandering to the radical Muslims is not mentioned. These oversights may not be totally relevant to Charlie Wilson but they are relevant to subsequent events.  Charlie Wilson is portrayed as a flawed -- well greatly flawed -- person and one of little depth.  He never understood or even tried to understand the actual situation, he only saw the suffering, which he blamed exclusively on the Russians.  So the film is very well done, entertaining, and well worth watching, but it fails to address the ramifications of Charlie's intercession in events that he really didn't understand.  So it is a good film but very narrow in its focus.  Charlie Wilson did a good deed but it is well worth remembering that no good deed goes unpunished.

I felt that that film was more sensational than it needed to be by focusing on such matters as the hot tub at the beginning at the expense of telling a more complete story.  For example, Gust deserved more background information, and the role of Michael Vickers was greatly understated.I remain a bit conflicted over Charlie Wilson.  His life style was deplorable, and I am still upset over the petty manner in which he took away a C-12 from our embassy in Islamabad.

1144323,A1QWEUEM90LL9D,B0013XZ2QA,"Steven Travers ""AUTHOR/WRITER""","[2, 3]","Let's get this out of the way off the top: I loved Charlie Wilson's War. It was patriotic, funny, sexy, well-acted and great drama. Fabulous movie. Five stars. Kudos. Love it.That said, just wanted to let it be known that the message of this film, at least one of the sub-texts of it, did not get past me. It was made by a liberal and meant to espouse a Democrat agenda.Hollywood is not about to make conservative movies now or in the future.  Charlie Wilson's War looks like a conservative movie at first, but watch closely and you will see it is something else. Yes, it is about how America, led by the CIA under the Reagan Administration, helped bring Communism, at least the Soviet variety, to its knees and end the Cold War in victory for the U.S. Hooray.Hollywood is about promoting Democrats and down-grading Republicans. Take for instance the recent spy thriller Breach. Since the beginning of time it seems, every spy who committed treason against America and the West was a Left-wing radical or sympathizer. Hundres of spies over decades of time. Alger Hiss, Kim Philby, Franklin's Roosevelt aides, the Rosenbergs; the list is long. What is not long is the number of movies about them. Those movies virtually do not exist. Instead they get lying portrayals of Joe McCarthy accusing innocent Jews and Democrats.  After the Venona archives opened in the Soviet Union in the early 1990s we discovered that many of those accused actually were Communists and spies. The poor, disgraced filmmakers, instead of living in abject poverty caused by mean conservatives, more often than not moved to the French Riviera or Cote d'Azur and made avante garde European movies with Luc Goddard. Such imprisonment!Then along comes Breach. Holy cow, after 200 or 400 consecutive liberal spies, none of whom seemingly by law or mandate are allowed to be portrayed on screen, Breach highlights the single conservative, Catholic man ever found top be a spy. Good movie but you can't fool me.Now comes Charlie Wilson's War by Left-wing screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, The American President, The Left, er, West Wing). Like A Few Good Men, Charlie Wilson's War was honest enough that it almost killed Sorkin's liberal message in a stream of conservative triumph. Patton was a similar movie, originally planned to portray the general as a war-mongering lunatic, except that America fell in love with the idea of beating Nazi Germany and George C. Scott's portrayal of the maverick hero.Charlie Wilson, played by Tom Hanks, was a Texas Democrat. The kind, which the movie does not tell us, who became a Republican when they saw how disgraceful the Democrats had become. A patriotic cDemocrat, which unfortunatly is an exception to the rule.The movie would have you believe that Wilson worked against the Reagan Administration to fund and lead the Afghan resistance that ended the Soviet empire. Then it would you believe that Wilson alone warned Reagan that unless they funded schools and cultural life, ""crazies"" like Osama bin Laden would make us rue the day later.Wilson deserves credit and he found some resistance here and there, but the idea that Ronald Reagan won the Cold War in Afghanistan kicking and screaming against his own policies is, well, not true. His CIA chief, Bill Casey, was wildly enthusiastic about the Afghan operation. I'll give Wilson his credit; the credit Sorkin never gives to Reagan and Casey.Watch the little messages in the movie: Wilson tells Julia Roberts (who plays a conservative matron and never looked better in the process), ""I'm a liberal."" He's about as liberal as Tom DeLay. He also tells her she owes him because she ""helped me out with the pro lifers,"" which of course is Sorkin's way of getting his vote in favor of abortion.But the most obvious stuff concerns Charlie's drinking, drugging and womanizing. He does good things, the movie informs us, and should not be held back by indiscretions and immoralities. Who is this supposed to remind us of? Bill Clinton, who was out there making the economy hum, keeping abortion legal, doing ""good work"" while those evil Republicans fought him at every turn. Lying, cocaine use, drunkenness; who cares?Sorkin gets a knock in at Rudy Giuliani. The movie was made in 2007 when Rudy was a front-runner for the 2008 GOP nomination which he eventually failed to capture. They also make sure to place forth the fiction that Congressman John Murtha was ""clean."" This was obviously an attempt by the filmmakers to apologize for the Democrat who opened his mouth and uttered the fiction that American soldiers were like Nazis in Iraq.Hey, loved Charlie Wilson's

1144325,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B0013XZ2QA,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[1, 2]","If not for this movie you could ask many people why they should know who Charlie Wilson was and they'd likely reply 'who?'  Even with this movie, and the book that it was based on, many people will continue to wonder who Charlie Wilson is and what his impact on history was.  Sadly, the fact that people have an impact on history is something far too many people miss in the U.S.A. and worse yet, many people never seem to think the idea of making an impact on history is something that should be aspired to.Charlie Wilson was a U.S. Representative from Texas, from a district that needed little, if anything, offering him an opportunity to collect far more political chits than those that he might need to trade away for any of his own goals (or those of his constituents).  Having those political chits, at least if you believe the based on the true story telling of his tale, offered Charlie Wilson the opportunity to help bring down the Soviet Union.Before I get too far along, I have to say I take exception to the idea of Charlie Wilson being responsible for bringing down the Soviet Union.  That description of Wilson's role in history is a vast over simplification of things, and gives far too much credit to one individual when there were many people and many policies involved in the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Suffice it to say that Wilson's role in perhaps hastening the end of the Soviet Union's role as a military power may have been quite significant and this story is certainly entertaining and somewhat enlightening about the characters and events that were happening behind the scenes and scope of public attention.Aaron Sorkin deliver's a good script with his usual crisp, snappy and intelligent dialog.  Tom Hanks delivers a good performance and the supporting characters, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman, do well in their roles too.  The story moves along at a good clip and comes in at a quite reasonable 90 minutes (approx).  Nudity and language earn the film the R rating, along with depictions of drug use, quips and sexual innuendo add to the need for the rating as well.  There's also images of the effects of the U.S.S.R.'s attacks on the Afghan people which may be upsetting to some viewers.A few more quick comments here.  This film was a Universal picture's release.  It's ironic that the disc includes a 'trailer' advertising the look and sound of perfect (HD DVD) since this film might have been one of the last of the HD DVD releases that Universal would have made.  Might have been, had Universal not dropped the format like a hot rock after Toshiba accepted defeat in the format war.  It's hard to tell whether or not this movie would really benefit from being released as hi-definition disc (eventually it'll be out on Blu-ray, and/or out on premium cable channels in a high-def format).  There are some scenes on the DVD release depicting the Soviet military copters that didn't seem to shine through as well as they should have.  Those scenes were not as effective as they should have been and looked flawed and downright bad to me in spots.  Hopefully the images transfer better in whatever hi-definition formats this film is made available on in the future.Depending on the price, this movie would make a nice addition to many collections.  Certainly worth viewing. (Un-box is a great alternative for those that want immediate satisfaction ;) )",4,"Good work all around.

1144328,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B0013XZ2QA,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[16, 24]","I'm going out on a limb here as most people adore the film. As an entertaining movie it's okay.While I'm as far from a prude as humanly possible, one may question Wilson's morality; you may recall the system did that with Bill Clinton to the point that they kept him occupied with it for years. The film brushed aside Wilson's goings-on with some women of dubious moral stature, particularly the filthy rich, ultra-right woman, played by Julia Roberts, who funded many of Wilson's endeavors--and in whom he indulged. The film just brushed aside this behavior, as if it were nothing more than a public relations blunder. I feel uncomfortable with that brush off, as it's what would cause much of the general public to challenge Wilson's stature right off.(The Washington Post had a lengthy piece on Wilson just about the time the film came out, confirming much of that behavior, though questioning some details, e.g., the cleavage of some of Wilson's staff.)Other reviewers have gone over the themes of the film so I won't reiterate them. At the end of the film, I was concerned--uncomfortable-- that there was minimal attention paid to the consequences of the Afghanistan maneuvers. Has anyone heard of a Saudi civil engineer and economist by the name of Osama bin Laden? He's one of the consequences. Or ""the base?"" (In Arabic Al Qaeda?) Another consequence.So I felt uncomfortable with the film without, frankly, much detail on why I felt that way. Then I was sent a review by Chalmers Johnson in which he referred to the film as an ""Imperialist Comedy."" Johnson took my discomfort and put far more substance to it. For instance, what I didn't know is that the US involvement in Afghanistan took place before the USSR had invaded. It was an attempt to bring a self-destructive, Vietnam-type experience to the Soviets. While that's at least dubious legally, if not illegal, it's something that needs to be discussed, not disregarged as the film did.Further, Wilson did all this conspiring without a word from his colleagues or consituency. In this, a democracy? Hmmm. Do your own thing, I guess.Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the screenplay, had originally included a line from CIA operative Gus Avrakotos, played very well by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, which goes, ""Remember I said this: There's going to be a day when we're gonna look back and say, 'I'd give anything if [Afghanistan] were overrun with Godless communists.'"" That line was elimated from the script.So the consequences of the US/Israeli involvement were barely covered by the film, though it's a preoccupation of a country today--one by which we can find ourselves victims with no culpability for those consequences.In short, the film didn't address the blowback of what we'd done, and at least implicitly makes a hero out of a man who did his own thing despite the consequences. We can get on the ""get them Russians"" bandwagon, while as usual ignoring the US experiences in Vietnam and elsewhere. We can laugh at what Wilson got away with, relative to a president who was in office at the same time. But, while we sold the Afghans some missiles to counter the technically superior Soviets, there WERE consequences for which we continue to pay. And the film barely touched them.",2,"Entertaining, but hopelessly inaccurate",1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,3237,"[""'m"", 'going', 'out', 'limb', 'here', 'most', 'people', 'adore', 'film', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'okay.While', ""'m"", 'far', 'prude', 'humanly', 'possible', 'one', 'may', 'question', 'Wilson', 'morality', 'may', 'recall', 'system', 'did', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'point', 'kept', 'occupied', 'years', 'film', 'brushed', 'aside', 'Wilson', 'goings-on', 'women', 'dubious', 'moral', 'stature', 'particularly', 'filthy', 'rich', 'ultra-right', 'woman', 'played', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'funded', 'many', 'Wilson', 'endeavors', 'whom', 'indulged', 'film', 'just', 'brushed', 'aside', 'behavior', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'public', 'relations', 'blunder', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'brush', 'off', 'what', 'would', 'cause', 'much', 'general', 'public', 'challenge', 'Wilson', 'stature', 'right', 'off', 'Washington', 'Post', 'had', 'lengthy', 'piece', 'Wilson', 'just', 'time', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'confirming', 'much', 'behavior', 'questioning', 'details', 'e.g.', 'cleavage', 'Wilson', 'staff', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'gone', 'themes', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reiterate', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'concerned', 'uncomfortable', 'was', 'minimal', 'attention', 'paid', 'consequences', 'Afghanistan', 'maneuvers', 'Has', 'anyone', 'heard', 'Saudi', 'civil', 'engineer', 'economist', 'name', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'one', 'consequences', 'base', 'Arabic', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'consequence.So', 'felt', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'frankly', 'much', 'detail', 'why', 'felt', 'way', 'Then', 'was', 'sent', 'review', 'Chalmers', 'Johnson', 'referred', 'film', 'Imperialist', 'Comedy', 'Johnson', 'took', 'discomfort', 'put', 'far', 'more', 'substance', 'instance', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'US', 'involvement', 'Afghanistan', 'took', 'place', 'USSR', 'had', 'invaded', 'was', 'attempt', 'bring', 'self-destructive', 'Vietnam-type', 'experience', 'Soviets', 'least', 'dubious', 'legally', 'not', 'illegal', 'something', 'be', 'discussed', 'not', 'disregarged', 'film', 'did.Further', 'Wilson', 'did', 'conspiring', 'word', 'colleagues', 'consituency', 'democracy', 'Hmmm', 'Do', 'own', 'thing', 'guess.Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'had', 'originally', 'included', 'line', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Gus', 'Avrakotos', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Remember', 'said', 'going', 'be', 'day', 'when', ""'re"", 'gon', 'look', 'back', 'say', ""'d"", 'give', 'anything', '[', 'Afghanistan', ']', 'were', 'overrun', 'Godless', 'communists', 'line', 'was', 'elimated', 'script.So', 'consequences', 'US/Israeli', 'involvement', 'were', 'barely', 'covered', 'film', 'preoccupation', 'country', 'today', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'victims', 'culpability', 'consequences.In', 'short', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'address', 'blowback', 'what', ""'d"", 'done', 'least', 'implicitly', 'hero', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'own', 'thing', 'consequences', 'can', 'get', 'get', 'Russians', 'bandwagon', 'as', 'usual', 'ignoring', 'US', 'experiences', 'Vietnam', 'elsewhere', 'can', 'laugh', 'what', 'Wilson', 'got', 'away', 'relative', 'president', 'who', 'was', 'office', 'same', 'time', 'sold', 'Afghans', 'missiles', 'counter', 'technically', 'superior', 'Soviets', 'WERE', 'consequences', 'continue', 'pay', 'film', 'barely', 'touched']",N/A

1144334,A3T8QNAEQ4SW7R,B0013XZ2QA,Vain Saints,"[11, 16]","The problem with giving this film any credit at all for its merits, which lie in the clever script and the excellent performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman, is that there is no way of separating any single good aspect of the film from the greater project behind it, and that project is transparent Hollywood-Pentagon Propaganda.  This is not a finessing of a potentially controversial movie to smooth out the rougher edges and garner a broader audience.  This is not a crass commercialization of a complex and nuanced story to turn it into an easily digestible popcorn film.  This is nothing more or less than Hollywood operating in conjunction with the Marine Motion Picture Liaison Center to deliberately rewrite history and blatantly fabricate the history of U.S. covert activity in the Russo-Afghan War.  It is even admitted that there was an on-set CIA agent ""advising"" on the script.You don't need to be a diligent student of Deep Politics, the CIA, or the Military Industrial Complex to grasp what blatant PR this film is.  You just need simple common sense.  The moral landscape of the film is uncomplicated.  The CIA operatives are cynical, but unambiguously noble in their intentions.  Hanks is primarily motivated by his deep caring of the suffering in Pakistan or something, and that's how he garners the support of the head of the Defense Appropriations Committee(!)  The fact that the US admits to have armed Afghanistan to incite a war with Russia before Russia was even there is not mentioned (and don't even think of the continuing relations between the US Gov. and extremist radical factions throughout the 80's and 90's).  They grossly overstate the effectiveness of the Stinger.  A crucial pivot point of the plot occurs when the Stinger, once provided to Afghan troops, proves to be a Super-Secret Weapon that the Godless Commies (they are seen joking about cheating on their wives in planes) just can never handle.  This should be ludicrous on its face to anyone with basic sense.It is precisely the silliness of the core political content (which in an overtly political film, is the core content) that makes the film resort to gratuitously overplaying the irrelevant angle of Charlie Wilson's libido.  Possibly half the film consists of  Charlie Wilson ogling his numerous nubile Congressional aids, or recounting Wilson's past and present affairs with sexy lobbyists, sexy fundraisers, sexy staffers, belly dancers, etc.  This is just overwrought characterization that does not drive or even influence the narrative in any way.  It's just eye candy thrown in all over the script for tits and giggles. It's as if someone were to write a Hollywood script about the political career of Jimmy Carter and replace Mondale and Brzezinsky with porn stars who brief (and debrief) Carter in a hot tub.  (While Jimmy Carter in a hot tub is an unpleasant thought, it's not as if anyone is going to be wowed by the snippet of Tom Hanks' 50-year-old bare tuckus.)  The only contribution that any of this makes to the film is the way in which it suggests how Charlie Wilson may have been used to bag money for the CIA's clandestine operations; the CIA probably used his indulgences in drugs and women against him as blackmail material. This is plausible to anyone who has the most rudimentary understanding of how the CIA operates, but it isn't even hinted at in the movie; or if it is, you'd have to be viewing it critically enough to know that the plot is bunk just to get the hint.So this is essentially two pointless films disguised as one allegedly meaningful film.  There is one romantic comedy about our fun-loving playboy Charlie Wilson who lives it up...period.  He sings, he dances, he tells jokes, but nothing happens.  His antics have no bearing on the main plot, they lead to no dramatic personal conflict, he learns nothing, the character doesn't arc and that subplot goes nowhere.  On the other hand, you have another historical/political film that is so deeply deceptive in the domains of history or politics that it insults the intelligence of the viewer.  And even on it's own terms, the narrative is anticlimactic.  Nothing is at stake except how to get arms to the film's heroes, the Mujahadeen (aka Al Qaeda); but they solve the ""problem"" a third of the way into the film.  First they fund/arm them and then they fund/arm them more, and keep funding/arming them, and then the war stops, and they stop funding them. That's the narrative arc.The ending of the film may be the most pathetically disingenuous aspect of it.  It is there when the cynicism of the film is at its starkest and its most brazen.  Charlie wants the government to fund schools for the Afghans, but the supposedly cynical and hardened Defense Appropriations Committee will have none of it.  This is supposedly Charlie Wilson's transformative moment as he ponders on the political system's lack of compassion as the film ends.  But once you get past the violins and the dramatic close-ups, a moment's reflection reveals that it's a fraud.  There is no there there.  The integrity of the system was never at stake, and it was never subverted.  It was never even an issue.  Charlie Wilson's conscience was clean throughout and this revelation that they were going to ""abandon"" the Afghans did not retroactively tarnish anything he did.  The issue was Charlie Wilson supposedly manipulating the Defense Appropriations Committee to arm the Afghans to bomb the hell out of the Russians, and that's exactly what he/they did. Charlie Wilson lived it up as the Afghans, armed with their Super-Stinger Weapon blew the Commie Bastards into the Great Unknown.  When they refused to fund schools, the most charitable reading of his character possible would have him feeling disappointed.  Less charitable readings would have him feeling indifferent.  No sensible reading would leave him devastated or transformed because the decision had no larger implications about his role in the events or his greater worldview.  And that's the fraud.  The movie uses dramatic cinematography, music, and lighting to manipulate the viewer into thinking that his worldview was challenged somewhere in the film, and it leaves the naive viewer with the impression that he has received a dose of the cruel and cold realities of politics, and that he is a wiser person for having seen it.  In reality, of course, his worldview was not intended to be challenged , but deliberately and manipulatively reinforced.  The issue of corruption is treated as though dire and subversive, but in effect comes across as a dingy spot on the otherwise glorious armor borne by the Great White Knight of US Foreign Policy.  The intended effect of this film, in conjunction with others like it, is to produce a peculiar sort of outlook that imagines itself to be skeptical and hardened while in reality being the most naive form of government fetishism.  That's why there have to be moments of fake introspection and fake moral dilemmas, such as in Black Hawk Down, The Hurt Locker, and Munich.  After Vietnam, the American public cannot really accept raw, unadulterated jingoism in their patriotic movies, so they have to throw a bit of token skepticism, just enough to leave the audience feeling worldly and wise while in reality swallowing the same indoctrination as always.

1144338,AP3B615GM191G,B0013XZ2QA,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[14, 17]","Political films are some of the hardest in Hollywood to pull off smoothly.  Either the subject matter is too controversial, it paints someone in too positive/negative of a light, or it flat out messes with history to fit a dramatic tone.  ""Charlie Wilson's War"" suffered from none of these problems, yet still managed to underwhelm due to a completely unexpected source: it couldn't decided whether it wanted to be gripping, or a farce.Basically, this movie tells the story of U.S. Senator Charles Wilson, who (during the Soviet-Afghanistan conflict) was so inspired by the courage of the Afghan troops in fending off the Russians that he launched a covert ""campaign"" of sorts to get the Afghans the funding/weapons they needed to defeat the spread of Communism from the Soviets.  As history bears out, Wilson succeeds in this task and is regarded as a hero...at least for the time being.This entire film could have taken (and would have been much better off, in my opinion) a more serious tact to the political issues being dealt with, like the lack of funding to an Afghanistan ""military"" that was essentially fighting the Soviets for the United States, or the fact that Afghanistan went on to produce the terrorists that perpetuated 9/11 and we are now fighting.  This approach could have been a great sort of dramatic ""treatise"" on those issues and could have made people really think about them.Unfortunately, the film does not take that sort of tone, and instead focuses on the character of Charlie Wilson.  While obviously at the center of all the goings-on, this prolonged focus on Wilson's personality and private life only served to drag the film down.  Plus, all the characters (but essentially Tom Hanks' Wilson and his lady-friend played by Julia Roberts) seem way too over the top in their interactions with each other and the plot at hand.  I realize the intent of the filmmakers, which was to show what a maverick Charles Wilson really was, but to me that wasn't the most interesting part of the story.Thus, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is a respectable film dealing with an interesting political event, yet views those happenings through a prism (the crazy Wilson) that isn't altogether engaging.  While the focus on the Afghan-Soviet conflict is refreshing (not just World War 2 or terrorism), it isn't played for the type of drama that could have occurred.  Involved political minds will find it interesting, while lesser scribes may drift off as the message gets lost in Hanks' over-the-top portrayal of Wilson.",3,"Could Have Been Epic, But Instead Was Just Interesting",1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,2525,"['Political', 'films', 'are', 'hardest', 'Hollywood', 'pull', 'off', 'smoothly', 'subject', 'matter', 'too', 'controversial', 'someone', 'too', 'positive/negative', 'light', 'out', 'messes', 'history', 'fit', 'dramatic', 'tone', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'suffered', 'none', 'problems', 'yet', 'still', 'managed', 'underwhelm', 'due', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'source', 'could', ""n't"", 'decided', 'wanted', 'be', 'gripping', 'farce.Basically', 'movie', 'story', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'Charles', 'Wilson', 'who', 'Soviet-Afghanistan', 'conflict', 'was', 'so', 'inspired', 'courage', 'Afghan', 'troops', 'fending', 'off', 'Russians', 'launched', 'covert', 'campaign', 'sorts', 'get', 'Afghans', 'funding/weapons', 'needed', 'defeat', 'spread', 'Communism', 'Soviets', 'history', 'out', 'Wilson', 'task', 'regarded', 'hero', 'least', 'time', 'being.This', 'entire', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'opinion', 'more', 'serious', 'tact', 'political', 'issues', 'being', 'dealt', 'lack', 'funding', 'Afghanistan', 'military', 'was', 'essentially', 'fighting', 'Soviets', 'United', 'States', 'fact', 'Afghanistan', 'went', 'produce', 'terrorists', 'perpetuated', '9/11', 'are', 'now', 'fighting', 'approach', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'sort', 'dramatic', 'treatise', 'issues', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'people', 'really', 'think', 'them.Unfortunately', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'sort', 'tone', 'instead', 'focuses', 'character', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'obviously', 'center', 'goings-on', 'prolonged', 'focus', 'Wilson', 'personality', 'private', 'life', 'only', 'served', 'drag', 'film', 'down', 'characters', 'essentially', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Wilson', 'lady-friend', 'played', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'seem', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'interactions', 'other', 'plot', 'hand', 'realize', 'intent', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'show', 'what', 'maverick', 'Charles', 'Wilson', 'really', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'story.Thus', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'respectable', 'film', 'dealing', 'interesting', 'political', 'event', 'yet', 'views', 'happenings', 'prism', 'crazy', 'Wilson', ""n't"", 'altogether', 'engaging', 'focus', 'Afghan-Soviet', 'conflict', 'refreshing', 'not', 'just', 'World', 'War', '2', 'terrorism', ""n't"", 'played', 'type', 'drama', 'could', 'have', 'occurred', 'Involved', 'political', 'minds', 'will', 'find', 'interesting', 'lesser', 'scribes', 'may', 'drift', 'off', 'message', 'lost', 'Hanks', 'over-the-top', 'portrayal', 'Wilson']",N/A
