242966,A1459L6R5SJ5XQ,6301015304,Alwyn L. Featherston,"[11, 13]","Growing up in the '60s, I thought that Joseph Heller's Catch 22 was one of the great literary achievements of my lifetime -- and I still do.When Mike Nichols' film version came out in 1970, I was disappointed. I'm not sure why I felt that way, except that it's impossible to capture the richness and the many layers of Heller's satyric masterpiece.Just today, I [watched]the recently released DVD version of this film ...for the first time in 30 years. All I can say is, I was blown away. I can't imagine what my 20-year-old self was thinking in 1970 ... this is simply one of the greatest films I have ever seen.Start with David Watkins' astonishing cinematgraphy ... it's reason enough to buy the DVD version. ...he does more dazzling things in the first 10 minutes than all the multimillion dollar special effects in .... There's one scene midway through the film, when Watkins shoots from in front of Yossarian's B-25 in flight -- with his entire squadron behind him -- that has to be seen to be believed.Seeing it again, Buck Henry's script is a masterful adaption of Heller's Rabelasian masterpiece. I think he captures the essense of the novel and even makes a couple of useful additions. Seeing the way he uses the comic elements reminds me of Robert Heinlein's explanation of humor: ""We laugh because it hurts to much to cry."" (from Stranger in a Strange Land, the OTHER seminal book of my youth!)Alan Arkin's Yossarian is superb -- The highest praise I can give is that it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the role. But the supporting performances are also uniformly excellent -- from Jon Voight to Martin Balsam to Bob Newhart to Jack Gilford to Bob Balaban to Martin Sheen to Art Garfunkel (in his first role). Special mention to Charles Grodin, especially in his final scene after mudering the young girl.One other performance deserves special mention -- the final film appearance of the great Marcel Dalio. Although only on screen for a brief time as the old man in the Roman whorehouse, his performance is, I believe pivotal to the film. It's the moment where the light, almost farcial tone of the film turns into a dark, Fellinieque nightmare. Watch Dalio after he finishes his conversion with Garfunkel, while Arkin takes over the dialogue and the old man sits quietly in the foreground, saying nothing, but continuing his lecture to Garfinkel with his eyes.There's so much more I could rave about ....Pardon my enthusiam. I'm still too overwhelmed by my viewing of the DVD (with a very, very useful commentary by Michael Nichols and Steve Sodenbergh) to sort everything out.But one of the DVD extras did help me understand just a little bit why the movie wasn't more successful -- it had to boast the worst theatrical trailer ever made.....",5,Worthy of Heller's novel,992217600,"06 11, 2001",2001,2763,"['Growing', 'up', ""'60s"", 'thought', 'Joseph', 'Heller', 'Catch', '22', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'literary', 'achievements', 'lifetime', 'still', 'do.When', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'film', 'version', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'was', 'disappointed', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'felt', 'way', 'impossible', 'capture', 'richness', 'many', 'layers', 'Heller', 'satyric', 'masterpiece.Just', 'today', '[', 'watched', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'first', 'time', '30', 'years', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', '20-year-old', 'self', 'was', 'thinking', '1970', 'simply', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Start', 'David', 'Watkins', 'astonishing', 'cinematgraphy', 'reason', 'enough', 'buy', 'DVD', 'version', 'more', 'dazzling', 'things', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'multimillion', 'dollar', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'scene', 'midway', 'film', 'when', 'Watkins', 'shoots', 'front', 'Yossarian', 'B-25', 'flight', 'entire', 'squadron', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed.Seeing', 'again', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'script', 'masterful', 'adaption', 'Heller', 'Rabelasian', 'masterpiece', 'think', 'essense', 'novel', 'even', 'couple', 'useful', 'additions', 'Seeing', 'way', 'comic', 'elements', 'Robert', 'Heinlein', 'explanation', 'humor', 'laugh', 'much', 'cry', 'Stranger', 'Strange', 'Land', 'OTHER', 'seminal', 'book', 'youth', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Yossarian', 'superb', 'highest', 'praise', 'can', 'give', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'role', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Jack', 'Gilford', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'first', 'role', 'Special', 'mention', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'especially', 'final', 'scene', 'mudering', 'young', 'girl.One', 'other', 'performance', 'special', 'mention', 'final', 'film', 'appearance', 'great', 'Marcel', 'Dalio', 'only', 'screen', 'brief', 'time', 'old', 'man', 'Roman', 'whorehouse', 'performance', 'believe', 'pivotal', 'film', 'moment', 'where', 'light', 'almost', 'farcial', 'tone', 'film', 'dark', 'Fellinieque', 'nightmare', 'Watch', 'Dalio', 'conversion', 'Garfunkel', 'Arkin', 'dialogue', 'old', 'man', 'quietly', 'foreground', 'saying', 'nothing', 'continuing', 'lecture', 'Garfinkel', 'eyes.There', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'rave', '.Pardon', 'enthusiam', ""'m"", 'still', 'too', 'overwhelmed', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'very', 'very', 'useful', 'commentary', 'Michael', 'Nichols', 'Steve', 'Sodenbergh', 'sort', 'everything', 'one', 'DVD', 'extras', 'did', 'help', 'understand', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'why', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'successful', 'had', 'boast', 'worst', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'ever', 'made', '..']",N/A

It was interesting that they chose to start the movie as Yossarian is stabbed by Nately's whore and then have the entire movie be a flashback leading up to that moment, even though that's not how the book begins, but the flashbacks seem cut and pasted together, no regard for whether or not they happened in that order or in that way in the book.  A bunch of important characters are left out or barely mentioned-where, for example, are Dunbar, Kid Sampson, Hungry Joe, Haverymeyer, or Clevenger?  The two nurses are also barely given any screen time, as well as the mysterious man in the hospital, the one in the body cast.  Important things like the Chaplain's struggle with his faith and Yossarian signing ""Washington Irving"" and ""Irving Washington"" to the letters he's censoring during his first stay in the hospital aren't even mentioned.  Someone who hasn't read the book would probably have a hard time understanding what all's going on, and even for someone who has read the book, the movie looks like a bunch of disconnected scenes, none of which seem to bear any real relation to one another.  A lot of the verbal humour in the book is lost in the screen version, and the constant flashbacks to Snowden's death, getting longer and more graphic as they go on, also seem meaningless unless one has read the book and understood their true importance (Snowden's secret, one of the most important parts of the book, isn't even dealt with).  Things are developed and lead into dead ends, just in time for the next bit of this cut and paste job.  Another example of something important being left out is that one of the primary reasons Yossarian goes awol in Rome is to try to find the kid sister of Nately's whore, since the whorehouse has been bombed and the occupants forced out, and he's worried about the twelve year old girl out alone in the eternal city.  I was shocked to see that Nately's whore doesn't lunge at him with a knife again as he's running away at the end, the way it happens in the book.

A definite artifact of its time, in terms of its style and content, it still holds up today.""Catch-22"" is a scathing indictment of war, as well as the State.  Yossarian's confrontation with Cathcart near the end of the movie highlights this, when Cathcart attempts to bully Yossarian into following Cathcart's orders by asking whether he loves his country.  Yossarian counters, correctly, that Cathcart and his lackey are not his country.  M&M; Enterprises, referred to by its organizer from square one as the ""Syndicate,"" is just a mafia by a different name, and its co-option of Cathcart and its effects on the fliers make the point that the State is just another organized crime outfit.The cinematography of this film is spectacular, with some astounding complex shots that last a very long time.Everyone in this movie went on to be famous, just about, if they weren't already - or at least became a ""hey, it's that guy"" type of actor.

However, it's too elaborately staged and too ambitious to be considered a &quot;bad&quot; movie.  And the extra features that accompany the DVD help the film transcend a &quot;thumbs up/thumbs down&quot; rating.First and foremost, it looks amazing.  I loved this film when I initially saw it on tape in 1990, but it was only recently that I was able to see it in a widescreen format -- letterboxing reveals what a brutal disservice pan-and-scan does to the compositions of &quot;Catch's&quot; 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  If you've only seen this movie in fullscreen, you haven't really seen this movie.The transfer is also incredible.  I'm so used to seeing the grainy print of my VHS copy that I hadn't realized how great a lot of the cinematography is.  The use of front-projection during the air-combat scenes is astonishing and the detail and color really surprised me.But the main reason to get this DVD is the commentary.  Director Mike Nichols is joined by Steven Soderbergh to talk about &quot;Catch-22&quot; and through their discussion, one really gets a sense of how Nichols (who had just directed back-to-back hits with &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf&quot; and &quot;The Graduate&quot;) took on this project with the best intentions and inspiration... and quickly got swallowed up by the massive project and even bigger budget.  Soderbergh is, in my opinion, one of the best directors doing commentary these days (he gives a perfect mix of technical details and storytelling) and he really knows his &quot;Catch-22&quot; ---though I find it a little incredible that he never noticed the changing portraits in Major Major's office, as he claims while watching the scene.This movie is a great mix of Fellini, Laugh-In, Welles and Salvador Dali.  Some may feel there's not enough Joseph Heller here but it would take a mini-series to cover all the bases of such a deep, rich novel.  At times, this movie can try your patience (like most Catch-22's often do) but it's definitely worth seeing and hearing in this new format.",5,an excellent dvd,992131200,"06 10, 2001",2001,2143,"['quot', 'Catch-22', 'quot', 'beautifully', 'designed', 'shot', 'executed', 'movie', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'However', 'too', 'elaborately', 'staged', 'too', 'ambitious', 'be', 'considered', 'quot', 'bad', 'quot', 'movie', 'extra', 'features', 'accompany', 'DVD', 'help', 'film', 'transcend', 'quot', 'up/thumbs', 'down', 'quot', 'foremost', 'amazing', 'loved', 'film', 'when', 'initially', 'saw', 'tape', '1990', 'was', 'only', 'recently', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'widescreen', 'format', 'letterboxing', 'reveals', 'what', 'brutal', 'disservice', 'pan-and-scan', 'compositions', 'quot', 'Catch', 'quot', '2.35:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'movie', 'fullscreen', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', 'movie.The', 'transfer', 'also', 'incredible', ""'m"", 'so', 'used', 'seeing', 'grainy', 'print', 'VHS', 'copy', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'how', 'great', 'lot', 'cinematography', 'use', 'front-projection', 'air-combat', 'scenes', 'astonishing', 'detail', 'color', 'really', 'surprised', 'me.But', 'main', 'reason', 'get', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'joined', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'talk', 'quot', 'Catch-22', 'quot', 'discussion', 'one', 'really', 'sense', 'how', 'Nichols', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'directed', 'back-to-back', 'hits', 'quot', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'quot', 'quot', 'Graduate', 'quot', 'took', 'project', 'best', 'intentions', 'inspiration', 'quickly', 'got', 'swallowed', 'up', 'massive', 'project', 'even', 'bigger', 'budget', 'Soderbergh', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'doing', 'commentary', 'days', 'perfect', 'mix', 'technical', 'details', 'storytelling', 'really', 'quot', 'Catch-22', 'quot', 'find', 'little', 'incredible', 'never', 'noticed', 'changing', 'portraits', 'Major', 'Major', 'office', 'watching', 'scene.This', 'movie', 'great', 'mix', 'Fellini', 'Laugh-In', 'Welles', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'may', 'feel', 'not', 'enough', 'Joseph', 'Heller', 'here', 'would', 'take', 'mini-series', 'cover', 'bases', 'such', 'deep', 'rich', 'novel', 'times', 'movie', 'can', 'try', 'patience', 'most', 'Catch-22', 'often', 'do', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'new', 'format']",N/A

243003,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301015304,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[31, 55]","Based on the incredibly popular novel by Joseph Heller, sporting Mike Nichols as director, and featuring a first rate cast that included a host of brilliant actors, CATCH-22 was one of the most highly anticipated films of its year.  And it proved one of the most critically-despised box office disasters of the early 1970s.  Almost every one loathed everything about it.The story concerns a group of WWII bomber crews and support staff stationed on an island off the coast of Italy, on which they make bomb runs--but this is merely the peg on which Heller hung his savage satire on American beaurocracy.  The film version, sadly, keeps the peg but manages to miss the rest.  Part of the problem here is that the humor of the novel is deeply tied into the way in which Heller tells his story--and it simply doesn't translate well into film.  That aside, Buck Henry's adaptation is an absolute disaster: instead of rapid-fire, it is slow-crawl, and instead of sharp-fanged it is gap-toothed.  Mike Nichol's direction is an equal miscalculation, for he approaches the material with an odd sense of detachment that effectively kills even the little bit that Henry's script had going for it to begin with.Given all of this, the surprising thing about the movie is how well-cast it is and how good some of the performances are.  You simply couldn't ask for a better Yossarian than Alan Arkin and the novel's Doc Daneeka might have been written with Jack Gilford in mind; Richard Benjamin, Art Garfunkle, Paula Prentiss, Bob Newhart, and even Orson Wells are among the many who give the film what little force it has.  But ultimately, even the best performances in the film can't get the show off the ground.  It is dead on arrival.  As for the DVD package itself, it isn't anything to write home about either; the film is well presented, but the commentary track is merely so-so and the rest of the package is ho-hum.

But that's not fair because this is really a 2-star movie. I loved the book. I also realize that there is no possible way to convey the sum contents of such a convoluted absurdist story as is presented in the book. But PLEASE!First, Alan Arkin's performance is pathetic. I'm not sure if he was directed to act like a 15 year old in a school play or if he's just a crappy actor (haven't seen him in any other major roles). Oh well, bad acting and bad direction can be forgiven if the story is solid. It is not. I was abysmally aghast at what they've done to the plot, the characters, the atmosphere.Any chances for deep characterization for any character besides Yossarian have been destroyed. The story has been utterly drained of humor, many of the pivotal points of the plot have been summarily butchered. When random non-Yossarian character acts irrationally, the movie makes them seem simply to be abject morons instead of possibly-once-thinking human beings trapped in the systemically propogated self-destructive thought-processes of the military bohemeth during a ""popular"" war.Cameos by Orsen Wells and Martin Sheen add a glimmer of hope that vanishes as soon as it is appearant that Nochols was only using their star-presence to fill an otherwise undressed screen.This movie premiered the same year as M*A*S*H*, and yet it seems, in every respect, trying to >BE&lt; M*A*S*H*. Why? The sinister and absurd humor of the book has been bled dry and filled with lack-luster stabs at irony (as if the audience is not smart enough to handle that part on their own).I understand the difficulty in trying to translate a book like Catch-22 to the screen. I also understand that the ""times"" will color the production in a way that may not have been anticipated at the time of the books publication or appreciated by the reader/viewer many years later.

I felt like I missed out on some literary masterpiece and decided it was something I needed to explore. I borrowed the book from the library and made it through roughly 70% of it. Heller prattles on and on way too often, which took away from the book in my opinion. It could have easily been 100 to 200 pages shorter, easily and not lost anything in doing so.The movie has an amazing cast. Alan Arkin (who I didn't discover until Little Miss Sunshine), Martin Sheen, Jon Voight, Orson Wells, and several other well known actors of the time. The director did a great job portraying the sometimes absurdity of war. The movie helped clear up some things that were lost in the book because of the the wordiness of the author. My major complaint about the movie was the lack of showing Yossarian blanking out the letters while in the hospital. That's what started the book off on its unconventional, and humorous, path, but was completely skipped over in the film.Another problem I had with both the film and the movie is the extent to which this crazy platoon went. It was definitely an over the top approach, which is OK to a point, but Heller (and consequently the film director) went way over and continued going. The bombing of their own quarters, which resulted in a death, is a suitable example.I'm not sure Catch should be as hyped as it is, but it helps a younger generation (such as myself) understand some of the things previous generations went through during these rough war times.

Peyronnin ""liquidlen""","[7, 23]","This movie has always had two or three of the hottest women's backsides shots this side of Mariylyn Monroe in Laurence Olivier's study. The sultry, hot, tightly-wrapped Olimpia Carlisi (with a visibly stirred Alan 'Yosarian' Arkin in apparent emphatic agreement)is in two of them and of course the tight uniformed Susanne Bennett in the well-known pre-mission briefing scene with Orson Welles.But this movie has not worn well over the years. Much of it comes off now as typical, end of the 60s pseudo-experimental, college-film-school influenced, pretentious radical posturing.The ""Dream"" sequences are examples of this, and themselves are boring. The movie is still sometimes funny, but the comic scenes, after one has outgrown the self-important parts of it, are found to be all stacked in the front of the movie. The movie gets more full of itself and less comic as it goes along.The commentary audio track feature that is available on this edition, with Steve Soderberg and this movie's director, Mike Nichols, if listened to as an evaluation of these two personalities, leads one to believe that it should not be surprising that one of these guys would create such self-important pap and the other would just adore it and fawn all over the director. Soderberg sounds just like a typical West-Coast pretentiously cool psuedo-intellectual, while Nichols sounds like he's acting the role of an aging beatnik. Soderberg's comments almost always involve the cinematography, the staging of shots, etc. He never says anything about the acting nor the writing. He also just fawns pathetically over Nichols all the time. The only value of the commentary feature are the precious few anecdotes that Nichols volunteers (which Soderberg's questions did absolutely nothing at all to prompt) such as the amusing fact that the Roman traffic cop in the Carlisi summer dress strolling scene is none other than screenwriter Buck Henry.Bottom line, it's only worth it for the bottoms!",1,It's the Butt(ocks) of its own jokes,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,1970,"['movie', 'always', 'had', 'two', 'three', 'hottest', 'women', 'backsides', 'shots', 'side', 'Mariylyn', 'Monroe', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'study', 'sultry', 'hot', 'tightly-wrapped', 'Olimpia', 'Carlisi', 'visibly', 'stirred', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'apparent', 'emphatic', 'agreement', 'two', 'course', 'tight', 'uniformed', 'Susanne', 'Bennett', 'well-known', 'pre-mission', 'briefing', 'scene', 'Orson', 'Welles.But', 'movie', 'not', 'worn', 'well', 'years', 'Much', 'off', 'now', 'typical', 'end', '60s', 'pseudo-experimental', 'college-film-school', 'influenced', 'pretentious', 'radical', 'posturing.The', 'Dream', 'sequences', 'are', 'examples', 'are', 'boring', 'movie', 'still', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'comic', 'scenes', 'one', 'outgrown', 'self-important', 'parts', 'are', 'found', 'be', 'stacked', 'front', 'movie', 'movie', 'more', 'full', 'less', 'comic', 'along.The', 'commentary', 'audio', 'track', 'feature', 'available', 'edition', 'Steve', 'Soderberg', 'movie', 'director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'listened', 'evaluation', 'two', 'personalities', 'one', 'believe', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'surprising', 'one', 'guys', 'would', 'create', 'such', 'self-important', 'pap', 'other', 'would', 'just', 'adore', 'fawn', 'director', 'Soderberg', 'just', 'typical', 'West-Coast', 'pretentiously', 'cool', 'psuedo-intellectual', 'Nichols', 'acting', 'role', 'aging', 'beatnik', 'Soderberg', 'comments', 'almost', 'always', 'involve', 'cinematography', 'staging', 'shots', 'etc', 'never', 'anything', 'acting', 'writing', 'also', 'just', 'fawns', 'pathetically', 'Nichols', 'time', 'only', 'value', 'commentary', 'feature', 'are', 'precious', 'few', 'anecdotes', 'Nichols', 'volunteers', 'Soderberg', 'questions', 'did', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'prompt', 'such', 'amusing', 'fact', 'Roman', 'traffic', 'cop', 'Carlisi', 'summer', 'dress', 'strolling', 'scene', 'none', 'other', 'screenwriter', 'Buck', 'Henry.Bottom', 'line', 'only', 'worth', 'bottoms']",N/A

243040,A3GK51JW3VWPRV,6301015304,Michael Welch,"[5, 12]","This film is now more than thirty years old, but its pertinence for our warrior present remains. I don't suppose a motion picture can truly alter a cultural perception any more than a popular novel can -- unless it is confirming a societal change rather than attempting to create it. So Joseph Heller's great 1961 novel stays in print and is read by new generations of high school and college students, and yet the reflexive embrace of war as an apt enterprise is still only questioned by a marginalized minority.Watching Mike Nichols' fine 1970 film adaptation, one can almost assume that director Nichols and writer Buck Henry (who also plays the part of the snide Colonel Korn) have resigned themselves to the inevitability of the real ""Catch-22,"" i. e., that for the same reasons that everyone in the movie behaves insanely, the audience will realize (yet agree to) the very same insanity as soon as they leave their viewing experience behind.""Catch-22"" the film is permeated by the world-weariness and desperate defiance of Captain Yossarian, the bombardier who doesn't want to bomb, played with a manic deliberation by Alan Arkin. The ""catch"" is that no matter that he realizes how capitalism and war are so madly linked (in Jon Voight's fascist businessman, Milo Minderbinder, whose ""M & M Enterprises"" is a literal representation of that infamous military-industrial complex), the only answer he can find is to flee. Orr, the other sane insane person (played with a kind of intense restraint -- or restrained intensity -- by Bob Balaban) succeeds in escaping to neutral Sweden, which is (or used to be) the emblematic democratic socialist state; so Yossarian finally follows because he can change nothing about the U. S. warfare state; indeed, he can only be co-opted by it: recall the repulsive Colonels Cathcart's and Korn's nefarious deal to ""like us!""Today, even Sweden has been forced into ""privatization"" and a systematic erosion of its socialist vision. But Sweden's image during the Vietnam War (in the midst of which Nichols' film was resonately produced) was as another Canada, another blessedly humane escape from America's ""endless wars."" Now it seems that there is no place to escape to; the American behemoth strides the globe, much like M & M Enterprises.Remember the exchange between Marcel Dalio's ""old man"" and Nately, portrayed by an achingly boyish Art[hur] Garfunkel: the old man confidently asserts that ""believing in everything (therefore, nothing)"" will allow at least survival, but when Yossarian returns to the brothel (to inform Nately's [lady] that Nately has been killed in Milo's ""just business"" bombing of their own air base), he is told that even the old man is ""dead."" So believing in nothing but survival is no guarantee of survival at that.This is a very depressing film; it's meant to be. It has some very amusing scenes, however -- especially the ones featuring a querulous Orson Welles as General Dreedle, Austin Pendleton as his nerdy son-in-law/military aide, and the buxom Susanne Benton as Dreedle's WAC. And then there is the Olympian beauty of Olympia Carlisi as the object of Yossarian's gentle lust, the prostitute Luciana. (Nichols satirizes Stanley Kubrick's somewhat pretentious, otherworldly ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by using the now-all-too-familiar opening notes of Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" to announce her initial appearance.) A few gentle scenes between Arkin and Carlisi are this movie's most warming moments, for -- as the dying Snowden keeps repeating -- ""I'm cold.""

Economic prosperity and efficiency outweighs any concerns for collective security: a herd mentality as a modus operandi is sufficient to assure that the group will prosper at the expense of the individual.  My favorite part is when Yossarian asks his C.O. why his parachute is missing, the C.O. tells him that all parachutes have now been discarded to ensure future profit and that it's simply better that way: one can see an interesting parallel with our present politics concerning policies of collective well-being such as retirement, health, education, etc., that always seem to be sidelined in favor of more profitable enterprises favoring the elite at the expense of the majority.The film is certainly not a complete or faithful adaptation of the book but few films are.

243051,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,6301015304,"Phred ""Phred""","[8, 9]","According to Amazon I had bought a different DVD Catch 22. That copy has many more reviews. This is the copy I have watched and have on my desk as I write. I will review this one. Noting that this copy does not qualify for free shipping, and allowing for the chance that that copy may still be cheaper after the added mailing cost, my first recommendation is that you buy the other version:Catch-22In my High School years this was the one book I could read and re read back to back. To this day I can quote key passages from memory. At one time I carried Joseph Heller's autograph on me at all times and I can still remember much of his book signing/reading (he had just published Something Happened). Yes I am a fan.Background . During WWII, Joseph Heller had been a bombardier on B 25's in the European Theater. He believed in the war and in his service. His purpose in using this experience in writing one of the blackest of darkly humored anti-establishment books was not to be specifically anti - military or anti-war, but to be anti - corporatism and anti - bureaucratic. His words, and I believe him.Very few writers can claim to have invented a term that has entered the common language, in this book, Mr. Heller invents the term Catch 22. In essence a catch 22, is any bureaucratic rule or policy that if followed gives you no choice and no win. As explained:1. You cannot be allowed to fly combat missions if you are crazy.2. You cannot be grounded from combat flying unless you ask to be removed.3. Only a crazy person would want to fly combat missions4. Anyone who asks to get out of combat isn't really crazyTherefore you cannot be removed from combat. And Catch 22 is some catch, ""The best there is.""Our hero, Captain Yossarian (Alan Arkin) had begun the war as a dedicated and even heroic - as in medal winning, lead bombardier. However between the constant increases in the number of missions need to finish a combat tour and his personal realization that ""they"" (everyone of who do you think?) are out to get him, he becomes more interested in his survival than in anything else.  In fact his entire unit has been pushed beyond their ability to cope and all are seeking at least temporary escape. Meantime Lt Milo Minderbinder (Jon Voight), who is ""only"" the temporary mess officer can make everybody rich if only he can be let off of combat duty.For you military hardware fans, the first 5 minutes of the movie may be all the excuse you need to buy this movie. In making this movie Mike Nichols (director) would collect one of the largest air forces then in existence. This is before CGI or digital anything. Those are real WWII B 25s lined up wing tip to wing tip rolling out and clawing for altitude on a crowded, dusty Mediterranean runway. The damaged B25 belching smoke and attempting to land on one wheel is a truly amazing piece of trick flying and, again this is before Industrial Light and Magic.From here on the movie is a slow decent into hell. Not just the hell of war or the personal hell of men at war. Heller, Nichols and Buck Henry (screen writer) slowly draw us into the inhumanity of bureaucracy in general and the profit motive in particular.Everywhere there are contradictions, madness and darkest of dark humor.Among the incidental achievement of this movie is the number of fresh faced young stars many of us now only know as mature performers. This is Bob Newhert, before TV doing an amazing turn as Major Major Major (his name and rank). Bob Balaban has a perfectly childlike face for Capt. Orr and an eerie glint of someone who knows not just The Problem, but its Solution. One point being that wars are fought by the young.The great Orson Welles is letter perfect in his cameo as Gen. Dreedle and to this day it is his voice I hear when I use the tag line: ""Take him out and shoot him."" - ok context matters here but it is funny.Be warned. This movie is not light, not easy and not straight forward. This was an early movie for using non linear time. It will be part of your job to understand the sequence of events. Heller, much inspired by the classics, will include as part of his hero's journey a decent into hell. This can be hard to watch, not funny and critical to the story.By the end this movie will make emotional and intellectual demands on you. It will also take more than one viewing to see it all.Fans of the book are right that this movie could have been longer. Fans of the book are right that the book is better. Ok, they are right. Allowing for the demands of artistic editing and movie budgets, this is the movie we got. Perhaps this is an example of Catch 22 in the real world.",4,The quintessential anti establishment book almost fully realized on screen,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,4641,"['According', 'Amazon', 'had', 'bought', 'different', 'DVD', 'Catch', '22', 'copy', 'many', 'more', 'reviews', 'copy', 'have', 'watched', 'have', 'desk', 'write', 'will', 'review', 'one', 'Noting', 'copy', 'not', 'qualify', 'free', 'shipping', 'allowing', 'chance', 'copy', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'cheaper', 'added', 'mailing', 'cost', 'first', 'recommendation', 'buy', 'other', 'version', 'Catch-22In', 'High', 'School', 'years', 'was', 'one', 'book', 'could', 'read', 're', 'read', 'back', 'back', 'day', 'can', 'quote', 'key', 'passages', 'memory', 'one', 'time', 'carried', 'Joseph', 'Heller', 'autograph', 'times', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'much', 'book', 'signing/reading', 'had', 'just', 'published', 'Something', 'Happened', 'Yes', 'am', 'fan.Background', 'WWII', 'Joseph', 'Heller', 'had', 'been', 'bombardier', 'B', '25', 'European', 'Theater', 'believed', 'war', 'service', 'purpose', 'using', 'experience', 'writing', 'one', 'blackest', 'darkly', 'humored', 'anti-establishment', 'books', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'specifically', 'anti', 'military', 'anti-war', 'be', 'anti', 'corporatism', 'anti', 'bureaucratic', 'words', 'believe', 'him.Very', 'few', 'writers', 'can', 'claim', 'have', 'invented', 'term', 'entered', 'common', 'language', 'book', 'Mr.', 'Heller', 'term', 'Catch', '22', 'essence', 'catch', '22', 'bureaucratic', 'rule', 'policy', 'followed', 'choice', 'win', 'explained:1', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'fly', 'combat', 'missions', 'are', 'crazy.2', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'grounded', 'combat', 'flying', 'ask', 'be', 'removed.3', 'Only', 'crazy', 'person', 'would', 'want', 'fly', 'combat', 'missions4', 'Anyone', 'who', 'get', 'combat', ""n't"", 'really', 'crazyTherefore', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'removed', 'combat', 'Catch', '22', 'catch', 'best', 'hero', 'Captain', 'Yossarian', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'had', 'begun', 'war', 'dedicated', 'even', 'heroic', 'medal', 'winning', 'lead', 'bombardier', 'However', 'constant', 'increases', 'number', 'missions', 'need', 'finish', 'combat', 'tour', 'personal', 'realization', 'everyone', 'who', 'do', 'think', 'are', 'out', 'get', 'more', 'interested', 'survival', 'anything', 'else', 'fact', 'entire', 'unit', 'been', 'pushed', 'ability', 'cope', 'are', 'seeking', 'least', 'temporary', 'escape', 'Meantime', 'Lt', 'Milo', 'Minderbinder', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'who', 'only', 'temporary', 'mess', 'officer', 'can', 'make', 'everybody', 'rich', 'only', 'can', 'be', 'let', 'combat', 'duty.For', 'military', 'hardware', 'fans', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'excuse', 'need', 'buy', 'movie', 'making', 'movie', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'director', 'would', 'collect', 'one', 'largest', 'air', 'forces', 'then', 'existence', 'CGI', 'digital', 'anything', 'are', 'real', 'WWII', 'B', '25s', 'lined', 'up', 'wing', 'tip', 'wing', 'tip', 'rolling', 'out', 'clawing', 'altitude', 'crowded', 'dusty', 'Mediterranean', 'runway', 'damaged', 'B25', 'belching', 'smoke', 'attempting', 'land', 'one', 'wheel', 'truly', 'amazing', 'piece', 'trick', 'flying', 'again', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic.From', 'here', 'movie', 'slow', 'decent', 'hell', 'Not', 'just', 'hell', 'war', 'personal', 'hell', 'men', 'war', 'Heller', 'Nichols', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'screen', 'writer', 'slowly', 'draw', 'inhumanity', 'bureaucracy', 'general', 'profit', 'motive', 'particular.Everywhere', 'are', 'contradictions', 'madness', 'darkest', 'dark', 'incidental', 'achievement', 'movie', 'number', 'fresh', 'faced', 'young', 'stars', 'many', 'now', 'only', 'know', 'mature', 'performers', 'Bob', 'Newhert', 'TV', 'doing', 'amazing', 'turn', 'Major', 'Major', 'Major', 'name', 'rank', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'perfectly', 'childlike', 'face', 'Capt', 'Orr', 'eerie', 'glint', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'Problem', 'Solution', 'One', 'point', 'being', 'wars', 'are', 'fought', 'young.The', 'great', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'letter', 'perfect', 'cameo', 'Gen.', 'Dreedle', 'day', 'voice', 'hear', 'when', 'use', 'tag', 'line', 'Take', 'out', 'shoot', 'ok', 'context', 'matters', 'here', 'funny.Be', 'warned', 'movie', 'not', 'light', 'not', 'easy', 'not', 'straight', 'forward', 'was', 'early', 'movie', 'using', 'non', 'linear', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'part', 'job', 'understand', 'sequence', 'events', 'Heller', 'much', 'inspired', 'classics', 'will', 'include', 'part', 'hero', 'journey', 'decent', 'hell', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'not', 'funny', 'critical', 'story.By', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'demands', 'will', 'also', 'take', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'see', 'book', 'are', 'right', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'Fans', 'book', 'are', 'right', 'book', 'better', 'Ok', 'are', 'right', 'Allowing', 'demands', 'artistic', 'editing', 'movie', 'budgets', 'movie', 'got', 'Perhaps', 'example', 'Catch', '22', 'real', 'world']",N/A

However, had it been an unknown, hidden book, I think this movie would have gotten a great deal more credit.This is without a doubt one of my favorite movies, and I can watch it over and over without feeling unsatisfied.  Why so much backlash towards this film?  Because it something it was not supposed to be.  The book is excellent, the movie is excellent, but they are excellent in their own rights.  They must be watched with great distance placed between each other, and to watch the movie and expect the book is a mistake.  The casting and acting is excellent, the cinimentography is extraordinary, the transitions are brilliant, the plot is tight, the humour is high grade, the tone is masterfully manipulated throughtout, there is nothing bad I can pin on this movie.  What is important to note is that the director is taking single concepts from the book and expanding on them.  Thus, the movie is more focused than the book.  This should make it neither inferior nor superior to the book, merely different.And different it is.  The shift from humour to dark drama is so seamless, it intensifies the emotional impact of the events that take place.  The artistic maneuvering of time is disorienting at first, but you'll soon wonder why more movies aren't done this way.  Some dialogue scenes are so well done, they pick up a life of their own and will play on in your head long after the movie is over.Rent this movie, and if its your kind of thing, buy it.

This criminally overlooked gem was trashed by critics upon its release in 1970, and never enjoyed a video transfer worthy of the filmmaker's effort, not even on laserdisc!  And as you can see from the varying reviews, the controversy rages on.  Which just proves how alive and well and timely a film Catch-22 truly is.Mike Nichols captures the essence of Joseph Heller's defining anti-war classic quite admirably, with a faithful adaptation by Buck Henry (who can be seen along with a veritable Who's Who period ensemble cast), with an eye as removed and objective as Kubrick, yet at times very visually subjective ..... an approach used to great advantage in his previous hit film The Graduate.  All the verbal and ethical contradictions of the book bring its dark humor to demented life, through a kaleidoscopic cavalcade of archtypical characters who make up the living nightmare of one Captain Yossarian, who has decided he can no longer bear to fly the combat missions his superiors have made it impossible to get out of.  To get out of flying, he has to be officially diagnosed as &quot;crazy&quot;, and must request to be grounded ..... but if he requests to be grounded, then he's not really crazy, and is therefore eligible to keep flying missions.  That's some catch, that Catch-22.This film, like the book on which it's based, is not so much an indictment of the insanity of war as it is a look at how the corporate mentality can find its way into the noblest of causes, and how beurocratic manipulations devaluate basic human principles, which take a back seat to merely &quot;looking good&quot;.  A timeless theme indeed.  This skewed logic is cheerfully accepted by all the story's characters ..... until our Yossarian's eyes are opened to the product of that logic literally disemboweled at his fingertips (yes, that scene was put back in!), and suddenly he is the outsider whose prime mission is to avoid any more missions.  Which is not an easy thing to do when Brass keeps adding more after you've completed your tour of duty.As far as the transfer itself:  It has probably never looked better since the original theatrical release over 30 years ago, especially being the first widescreen release of this title, which is the only way to experience it as intended.  The transfer team did the best they could with the mono soundtrack, I'm sure, which does get compressed and distorted at times, something we enthusiasts of early films live with.Mike Nichols' Catch-22 may only enjoy cult status, but it is DVD releases like this (and that other oddball, star-studded 60's curiosity Candy) that make one truly appreciate what is being done with this revolutionary medium.

It's a funny, touching, brilliant novel that reveals better than any I've read the absurdities of war.  I watched Mike Nichols' CATCH 22 many years ago, half of it, anyway, on broadcast television, and carried away a negative impression.Well, I could have been wrong.  Sometimes if we wait a decade or two that we hate changes into something good.  Not with this one, though.  Alan Arkin is still annoyingly affect-less as the main character, Yossarian, the bombardier who is driven crazy (or not, I guess) by the squadron commander's constant raising of the number of missions the men have to fly before they can be rotated out.  If Arkin's deadpan approach keeps his character at a distance, Buck Henry's over-the-top take on the squadron's executive office isn't any more enjoybable.  In between are a bunch of big stars are given a chance to ham it up for a scene or two to middling effect.  Really, this movie felt more like it was a series of skits stitched together than a coherent movie.  Looks good, though (great photography and set designs.)It's been a few years since I've read Heller's book, and I have to admit that I found the movie's plot difficult to follow.

If you have no military experience, watch it as a documentary.  I received my indoctrination in the 1950's when I arrived in Korea as a Private.  Upon arrival, we were sent to the Supply Room and given a long list of equipment and supplies which we were required to have immediately. We were also informed that  there was a small problem.  These items, normally furnished by the Supply Room, were currently out-of-stock and expected to remain so. Fortunately, an old woman just outside the fence had all the items in quanity, but if we purchased anything from her,  we would be buying from the Black Market, which was illegal. The old woman liked a certain brand of soap, however, and would trade each item for an established number of bars of the soap.  Fortunately, we could legally purchase unlimited bars of this soap (3 at a time) at the Post Exchange at a very reasonable price.  For a few bars extra, she would arrange for all our new patches to be sewn onto our uniforms.  All we needed to do was sign a receipt for advance pay which the Army would give to help us feel welcome and get settled in.  We could use the money to purchase things like soap, for example.  Did we all understand our duty?  Yeah, Sarge.  We got it!We had a 24 hr Mess Hall, but the food consisted of large vats of things like powdered eggs, powdered milk, powdered potatoes, oatmeal, etc, which appeared to have been chewed, partially digested, then regurgitated before being served.  Choice UDSA steaks, eggs, fresh vegetables, etc, were available in the local village to be traded for cigarettes and alcohol, which we could purchase in unlimited quantities at the Post Exchange at a very reasonable price.  For a consideration, cooks in the Mess Hall would skillfully cook the food for us. Did we all understand our dining options?  Yeah, Sarge.  We got it! And so it went.The Military Air Transportation Service was extensively used for world-wide distribution for all sorts of contraband. With US taxpayers covering all shipping costs, smuggling boomed.I read Catch-22 in the 1960's. It was hilarious and insane.  Due  to my personal experience in the Army, I accepted it as a realistic, highly entertaining, but sometimes sobering, account of World War II in Europe. The subsequent movie was a big disappointment to me, because it left out so many parts of the book.  Now, after 36 years, when I watch the DVD, I think the movie is superb and really captures the spirit of the book. Some well chosen special features and more commentaries would have been nice, but the movie speaks well for itself. Had it tried to cover the entire book, the movie would have made Gone With The Wind seem like a featurette.Perhaps it has just been too long since I read the book, but, be that as it may, to anyone who hasn't read the book or seen the movie recently, I recommend that you ignore the critics and watch this DVD.  Then, if you enjoy the DVD, read the book.

The all-star lineup would have cost a large fortune in a remake today. All those B-25 bombers - real flying aircraft and not computer generated - there are but a handful of restored versions today. The US Air Force sold a number of surplus to the Brazilian and Mexican air forces after the war. I understand that's where the producers found them for the movie. As an anti-war statement (during the Vietnam era) Catch-22 is one running joke after another.  ""The Never Ending Mission"" should have been its subtitle.

Watch how many folks complain how wrong the filmakers got it and how it is crap because it doesn't fit their idea of the Batman mystique acquired from their readings, nay, studying of the comic books.What does this have to do with the movie Catch 22?There are too many critics here who didn't like this Mike Nichols rendition of Joseph Heller's war novel Catch 22. I say Frog Them and see for yourself what's up with this rendering (another view) of the war story. I however read the book and saw the movie and thought the movie to be just fine. No, better than fine. The movie captures the story and the mood of the novel superbly.Yossarian (played by Alan Arkin) famously discovers that part of the enemies in war are not only the ones you bomb and shoot, but the ones who are said to be *on your side*... but have either 1) a jackbooted mentality towards military protocol or 2) so corrupted by taking advantage of the loopholes in the protocol that they are criminal....Yossarian tries to get a psychological deferment to not fly the bombers any more and try to get home...he wants the powers that be think he's nuts so he would not be further exposed to the inanity and insanity of war, but of course gets confronted with the 'damn if you do fly and damn if you don't fly' orders from the military protocolists...if Yossarian knows its flying in another mission which makes him nuts, he can't possibly be nuts, so he must fly in another mission...Striking in the book as well as the movie are the scenes where: Yossarian discovers his gunner has been riddled with artillary fire, a soldier gets destroyed by the propellers of a low flying aircraft and all the soldiers various madnesses with the ladies of the red light district...as well as how the military supplier becomes as fascistic as the enemy.It is a good movie that I feel didn't get it's due because it went against the grain of most war stories being told. It poked a little fun at the ridiculousness of war and of men in war...it has a 60's draft card burning, hippie protest feel about it.
