The showdown between Pray and Chang is one of the most fun swordfights I've seen - nice choreography. Wai Pak's moves here seem a lot more polished and confident that they did during his time at Shaw Bros.The movie switches between dark and serious, to comedy, to tear-jerker fairly frequently, but it gets more right than it does wrong. Throw in a good twist near the end (""That's one hell of a move"") and you have a movie that while not necessarily a classic, is enjoyable and worth repeat viewings. If you have someone you're trying to introduce to 70's kung-fu/wuxia, this would be a decent place to start - It's distinctively Woo-esque and therefore has a more modern flavor than some.It's a 3.5 star movie, but that's not an option and the extras are good stuff, so, what the hell, we'll go four stars.",4,Worth a Viewing,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,926,"['Not', 'best', 'sense', 'still', 'kick', 'see', 'early', 'John', 'Woo', 'wuxia', 'good', 'performances', 'showdown', 'Pray', 'Chang', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'swordfights', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'nice', 'choreography', 'Wai', 'Pak', 'moves', 'here', 'seem', 'lot', 'more', 'polished', 'confident', 'did', 'time', 'Shaw', 'Bros.The', 'movie', 'switches', 'dark', 'serious', 'comedy', 'tear-jerker', 'fairly', 'frequently', 'more', 'right', 'wrong', 'Throw', 'good', 'twist', 'end', 'one', 'hell', 'move', 'have', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'classic', 'enjoyable', 'worth', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'have', 'someone', ""'re"", 'trying', 'introduce', '70', 'kung-fu/wuxia', 'would', 'be', 'decent', 'place', 'start', 'distinctively', 'Woo-esque', 'therefore', 'more', 'modern', 'flavor', 'some.It', '3.5', 'star', 'movie', 'not', 'option', 'extras', 'are', 'good', 'stuff', 'so', 'what', 'hell', ""'ll"", 'go', 'four', 'stars']",Last Hurrah for Chivalry VHS

424012,A1U11PS71ML0YJ,6304458657,"Derrick Jenkins ""love of Gaming/Movies/Anime/...","[1, 1]","As this classic opens, we find a couple of characters in vastly different positions.  With one being a drunk, assasin for hire that has no morals at all.  Add in a little bit of romance that is rebuffed repeatedly by the would be assassin and the woman who longs for his affection.  Then we have another that's more into doing his own thing but is very well known for his martial arts skills.  There's a 3rd party that plays pretty prominently in this film as well.  It seems that his intentions are good when he tries to hire the skilled martial arts fighter.  Its over revenge for his family that were killed.Its what we are led to believe at least.  I won't give out what it's really over.  But i must say that i didnt see that one coming at all.  For a film of this age, it transfers well as things are bright and lively.

424013,AWWTBOXKPLNSM,6304458657,dlrife1965,"[0, 0]","Actually enjoyed this movie. Read several of the other reviews, but have always been a fan of 'Saturday Morning Kung Fu', a weekly show when I grew up that featured many good movies and some bad ones too. This would rank in the upper echelon of those movies. Good story, surpirse ending that caught me off guard. Liked it, except for the fact that the main whiney antagonist, who's family was killed by the main bad-ass antagonist, was supposed to be nowhere near as good, and had to get the two protagonists who were to kill for him. They killed the main bad-ass, but then Whiney kicked their asses all over the place, thanks to some magical sword. What? No way, especially when throughout the movie Whiney gets his ass handed to him all the time. I so wanted Whiney to have been killed, and he was, in what was the best chop-socky buddy movie I have seen in a while. Still, I really thought it would end a little differently, and this movie had many surprises. Yes, the action was scripted. Duh. But it was still good stuff, and worth the watch. If you grew up watching stuff like this, like I did, then you will know what I am talking about- this movie would have been in my top list as a kid, and honestly still will be.",4,"Surprise ending, pretty decent movie....4 stars.",1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,1224,"['Actually', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Read', 'several', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', ""'Saturday"", 'Morning', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'weekly', 'show', 'when', 'grew', 'up', 'featured', 'many', 'good', 'movies', 'bad', 'ones', 'too', 'would', 'rank', 'upper', 'echelon', 'movies', 'Good', 'story', 'surpirse', 'ending', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'Liked', 'fact', 'main', 'whiney', 'antagonist', 'who', 'family', 'was', 'killed', 'main', 'bad-ass', 'antagonist', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'had', 'get', 'two', 'protagonists', 'who', 'were', 'kill', 'killed', 'main', 'bad-ass', 'then', 'Whiney', 'kicked', 'asses', 'place', 'thanks', 'magical', 'sword', 'What', 'way', 'especially', 'when', 'movie', 'Whiney', 'ass', 'handed', 'time', 'so', 'wanted', 'Whiney', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'was', 'was', 'best', 'chop-socky', 'buddy', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'Still', 'really', 'thought', 'would', 'end', 'little', 'differently', 'movie', 'had', 'many', 'surprises', 'Yes', 'action', 'was', 'scripted', 'Duh', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'stuff', 'watch', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'stuff', 'did', 'then', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'about-', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'top', 'list', 'kid', 'honestly', 'still', 'will', 'be']",Last Hurrah for Chivalry VHS
424014,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,6304458657,D. Mok,"[2, 3]","Last Hurrah for Chivalry, despite its cheesy English title, is important for two things:  One, it broke new ground in period martial-arts films by its use of contemporary language and attitudes; two, it introduces many quintessential John Woo stylistic conceits, thematic elements, and cinematic devices.The anachronistic speech patterns and occasionally bad humour are not to everybody's taste.  However, what it does achieve for the film is a sense of intimacy for the characters missing from Woo's previous films, such as Hand of Death.  The use of the Cantonese language brings Last Hurrah for Chivalry down to an earthy level, allowing the actors to loosen up.  In the case of Wei Pai and Liu Sung Yen, this is really a good thing, freeing them up to express their characters better.Woo's signatures begin to emerge very clearly in this film.  The characters of Cheung the Third and Green Robe are really precursors to character pairings in later Woo films such as Jeff and Eagle Lee (The Killer), Potcake and Jim (Once a Thief), and most important, Ho and Mark/Ken from the A Better Tomorrow series.  Just the interplay between Wei and Liu along is worth the whole film, Wei's earnest naivete and Liu's engrossing mix of drunken clowning and deadly silence making for some of the best character interactions in the Woo oeuvre, rivalling that of Chow Yun-fat and Ti Lung in A Better Tomorrow.  The over-the-top sound design and hair-raising fight choreography give the fight sequences a real sense of danger, while the themes of honour, betrayal, despair and fate are lifted intact and incorporated into the Killer, right down the the ending.In fact, the only fault of this film is its moments of crude humour, usually thanks to bad bit players (eg. the henchmen of the villain Bai Zhong Tang).  Still, Last Hurrah for Chivalry is one of Woo's best early films.",4,John Woo's most important pre-1986 film.,1023235200,"06 5, 2002",2002,1866,"['Last', 'Hurrah', 'Chivalry', 'cheesy', 'English', 'title', 'important', 'two', 'things', 'One', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'period', 'martial-arts', 'films', 'use', 'contemporary', 'language', 'attitudes', 'two', 'many', 'quintessential', 'John', 'Woo', 'stylistic', 'conceits', 'thematic', 'elements', 'cinematic', 'devices.The', 'anachronistic', 'speech', 'patterns', 'occasionally', 'bad', 'humour', 'are', 'not', 'everybody', 'taste', 'However', 'what', 'achieve', 'film', 'sense', 'intimacy', 'characters', 'missing', 'Woo', 'previous', 'films', 'such', 'Hand', 'Death', 'use', 'Cantonese', 'language', 'brings', 'Last', 'Hurrah', 'Chivalry', 'down', 'earthy', 'level', 'allowing', 'actors', 'loosen', 'up', 'case', 'Wei', 'Pai', 'Liu', 'Sung', 'Yen', 'really', 'good', 'thing', 'freeing', 'up', 'express', 'characters', 'better.Woo', 'signatures', 'begin', 'emerge', 'very', 'clearly', 'film', 'characters', 'Cheung', 'Third', 'Green', 'Robe', 'are', 'really', 'precursors', 'character', 'pairings', 'later', 'Woo', 'films', 'such', 'Jeff', 'Eagle', 'Lee', 'Killer', 'Potcake', 'Jim', 'Once', 'Thief', 'most', 'important', 'Ho', 'Mark/Ken', 'A', 'Better', 'Tomorrow', 'series', 'Just', 'interplay', 'Wei', 'Liu', 'along', 'whole', 'film', 'Wei', 'earnest', 'naivete', 'Liu', 'engrossing', 'mix', 'drunken', 'clowning', 'deadly', 'silence', 'making', 'best', 'character', 'interactions', 'Woo', 'oeuvre', 'rivalling', 'Chow', 'Yun-fat', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'A', 'Better', 'Tomorrow', 'over-the-top', 'sound', 'design', 'hair-raising', 'fight', 'choreography', 'give', 'fight', 'real', 'sense', 'danger', 'themes', 'honour', 'betrayal', 'despair', 'fate', 'are', 'lifted', 'intact', 'incorporated', 'Killer', 'right', 'ending.In', 'fact', 'only', 'fault', 'film', 'moments', 'crude', 'humour', 'usually', 'thanks', 'bad', 'bit', 'players', 'eg', 'henchmen', 'villain', 'Bai', 'Zhong', 'Tang', 'Still', 'Last', 'Hurrah', 'Chivalry', 'one', 'Woo', 'best', 'early', 'films']",Last Hurrah for Chivalry VHS

One of the things that puts this film so high on my list is the great characters and how interesting and unique they are.  Even the characters with less screen time shine here nearly as bright as the stars of the film themselves.  The assasin Pray for instance, has fantastic presence in all of his scenes and has the best fight scene in the film when he battles Chang to the death (my opinion of course).

The audio is flawless.  Of course, the presentation of the menus and extras is top-notch.The biggest point I'd like to make is that John Woo not only directed this film, he also wrote it.  He hasn't done much in the way of writing when it comes to his US films.  But back in HK, he wrote just about every one of his major films.  To me, that makes this film all the better.  If you are a Woo fan, but have somehow missed this, you'll love it.  It is trademark Woo.2 friends who fight side by side-check.  Slo-mo combined with slick choreography-check.  Slick moving camera that takes on a life of its own-check.  Sense of epic and grandeur-check.  Doves flying just prior to a major action scene-che. . .OK, so it doesn't have ALL the Woo trademarks.  But most of them.The story is very solid and takes some turns to keep it from being just standard action fare.  If you enjoy Kung Fu flicks, this one is excellent.  While it's not Crouching Tiger or Hero and isn't loaded with wire-fu.  It is definitely the predecessor of these films and is most enjoyable, even by today's standards.I really thought I would have to lower my expectations a bit since it was an older film that would primarily have the 'rhythmic' kung fu you could set a metronome to.  But even that played out well, and more creatively than I would have thought.  There's a ton of action, the characters are fun and have some dimension, the story flows well and is creative, and it's just a good movie.

424018,A9LSLYQW28X6H,6304458657,Jeff Van Gastel,"[1, 1]","Review of the widescreen edition of Dragon Dynasty release of ""Last Hurrah for Chivalry"".  This is an early John Woo directed movie, where he just joined the Golden Harvest studio.The movies starts off with a wedding, with Mr. Kao marrying the local concubine.  When asked why he married a whore, he replies: "" I did it for the publicity"". Classic !  The wedding party is interrupted by local rivals led by the nefarious  Pai (played by Lee Hui-Son).  Pai and his crew slaughter everyone, but Mr, Kao escapes. As he recovers, Mr, Kao is looking for martial artists to recruit to avenge his and his families honor.  He encounters Chang of the Magic Sword (played by Wei Pai), who later befriends Green the Assassin (Daiman Lau).  Kao recruits Chang to help him defeat Pai, and along the way Green decides to help Chang. During this time, Pray (Fung Hak-On) comes to challenge Chang as the best swordsman in the area.  There is a great duel in the country between the two.  After Chang defeats Pray, he and Green go to Pai's villa to defeat him.  There are some great martial arts, but the best is Chang and Green versus the Sleeping Wizard(Chien Yuet San).  Awesome swordsplay, martial arts, and comedy thrown in for good measure!I really enjoyed the martial arts choreography.  There are some great duels not only with kung fu, but various types of martial arts weapons.  Pray, one of the villains, was actually also the action choreographer of the movie.  There are some great twists in the plot, as another reviewer already mentioned.  I saw one coming, but it turned out opposite of what I thought!  There is some great comedic interaction between the various parties, including Green and Chang, and then in the battle of Green, Chang, and the Sleeping Wizard!Some of the extra's on the DVD include:* Commentary of the film by Kung Fu Cinema Expert Bey Logan.* Pray For Death: Interview with Fung Hak-On.Fung was Pray in the movie, who as I mentioned before was also the action choreographer on the film.  He relates who he and John Woo made the transition to Golden Harvest Studios, and their relationship as friends.* Deliver Us From Evil: An Interview with Lee Hui-SanLee was Pai, the evil martial artist in the film.  He is very entertaining as he describes how the movie was made and the various actors in the film.* Legendary Weapons of China FeaturetteThis small documentary was very informational.  One of the best extra's I have seen in a martial arts movie. Bey Logan talks about the various weapons used in the martial arts movies.

Luckily for me, disappointment was no longer on the menu.  What was, you ask?  Wei Pai (Snake, of ""5 Deadly Venoms"") playing a nice guy, beautiful picture quality, and sword-fights that just kept gettin' better.  The latter fights are far from the best ever, but they are still a lot of fun to watch.The story is okay, nothing too fancy; a man's new wife and a lot of his clan are wiped out by a rival (Lee Hoi San, of ""everything"" fame), so he looks for fighters to help dispense some justice.  Wei Pai and Damian Lau play the swordsmen in question, befriended by the widower, prior to their revenge-soaked undertaking.  Pretty cool stuff.  Though I really could have done without the ""sleeping sword"".  I dislike when a movie that keeps the sense of humor to a minimum suddenly breaks into something ridiculous.  I certainly can't criticize creativity, it just kind of interrupts the flow.An early film on the resume of John Woo, it has his trademark violence, deception and male-bonding.  I love how dudes in his movies become friends by meeting and simply suggesting that they become friends.  Usually, that only happens at 3am in the laundromat between weirdos, who recently consumed a quart of whiskey, each.Dragon Dynasty does it again with this marvelous release, with plenty of special features.

424028,APIW11UEPKIC2,6304458657,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[14, 14]","Wei Pai stars as a master swordsman who loves his sister and always tries to help people in need.  Damian Lau (Duel to the Death) stars as a drunkard who's sword skills are at least equal to Wei Pai's.  A man named Master Kao is looking for men to revenge his family who were killed at the start of the movie.  Master Kao gets the 2 swordsmen to help him out, but he seems to be hiding what his plan really is.  I thought I knew exactly what was going on, but I got a major surprise during the last act of the movie.  The story is good for the most part, but the action is definitely the best thing about the movie.If you have seenThe Hand of Death, then you know that John Woo was a good kung fu movie maker.  Last Hurrah for Chivalry is his masterpiece.  There are plenty of heroic moments, and it gets pretty bloody, but John Woo's style is very unique.  The story is told well, the 2 heroes have some good comedic exchanges, and the villains are all extremely tough.  It covers all the essentials.  110% effort was put into every part of this movie, including the sets.  Golden Harvest tried hard to rival the Shaw Brothers sets, and their hard work really pays off.  The sets never feel cheap, and the outdoor locations are also stunning.  The cinematography always feels alive and makes scenes better than they would be just sitting idle.  You can see why John Woo moved onto bigger and better things not long after making this.The action is top notch.  The choreography isn't the absolute best you will ever see, but the directing and editing are superb, and the action scenes are very intense.  Fung Hak-on (the fight choreographer) has the best fight of the movie vs. Wei Pai, and all of the other fights are good.  This is the best physical performance I have ever seen from Damian Lau.  His sword skills are of course excellent, but his athletic skills also impressed me.  Lee Hoi San is great as the main villain, but Chien Yuet San steals the show as the Sleeping Wizard.  I have seen the sleeping style used in 4 or 5 movies, but this is by far the funniest version.  And the action is not strictly sword fighting.  There is a great hand to hand match with Lee Hoi San, and even during the sword fights there are a lot of punches.4.5/5The picture quality is too bright and there is some speckling, but the picture quality is still pretty good.  Sound quality is perfect.  The English dub is hard to listen to, but luckily the original Cantonese track is included.  Subtitles are well written.Special features include a great commentary from Bey Logan.  He is a very knowledgable Hong Kong film expert, and he gives tons of interesting info.  This is one of the better Dragon Dynasty commentaries I have heard.In the 9 minute interview with Fung Hak-on, he talks about how he came to work with John Woo.  He also talks about having to film 100 strokes in a single take.  This might seem unbelievable, but he says that he messed up on the 99th stroke and had to film it over again.  It ended up taking too long, and John Woo had to edit it.  Filming fight scenes in great kung fu movies did not take a day or two, it could take half a year, or sometimes even longer depending on how many action scenes are in the movie. He also talks about his assistant Chien Yuet Sang and his crazy sleeping style.  And it seems that this movie is where that style came from.  Fung Hak-on is definintely among the best ever fight choreographers, and it is always a joy to hear every word he has to say.  The great thing about the Dragon Dynasty DVDs is that they always get new interviews with the actors.  It is really a kung fu movies fan's dream come true.The 11 minute interview with Lee Hoi San is great.  He talks about his long friendship with Fung Hak-on, his role in the movie, and other things.The 11 minute Legendary Weapons featurette is another Dragon Dynasty exclusive.  It is hosted by Bey Logan and he gives short descriptions of the weapons used in the movie, and also gives demonstrations.  Then some Chinese guy gives a more full demonstration.  Yet another excellent special feature from Dragon Dynasty.I am stuck between whether I should give this movie a 4 or a 5 star rating, but the special features easily bump this disc up up to a 5.",5,Another magnificent Dragon Dynasty release,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,4256,"['Wei', 'Pai', 'master', 'swordsman', 'who', 'sister', 'always', 'tries', 'help', 'people', 'need', 'Damian', 'Lau', 'Duel', 'Death', 'drunkard', 'who', 'sword', 'skills', 'are', 'least', 'equal', 'Wei', 'Pai', 'man', 'named', 'Master', 'Kao', 'looking', 'men', 'revenge', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'killed', 'start', 'movie', 'Master', 'Kao', '2', 'swordsmen', 'help', 'out', 'be', 'hiding', 'what', 'plan', 'really', 'thought', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'got', 'major', 'surprise', 'last', 'act', 'movie', 'story', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'action', 'definitely', 'best', 'thing', 'movie.If', 'have', 'seenThe', 'Hand', 'Death', 'then', 'know', 'John', 'Woo', 'was', 'good', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'maker', 'Last', 'Hurrah', 'Chivalry', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'plenty', 'heroic', 'moments', 'pretty', 'bloody', 'John', 'Woo', 'style', 'very', 'unique', 'story', 'told', 'well', '2', 'heroes', 'have', 'good', 'comedic', 'exchanges', 'villains', 'are', 'extremely', 'tough', 'essentials', '110', '%', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'part', 'movie', 'including', 'sets', 'Golden', 'Harvest', 'tried', 'hard', 'rival', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'sets', 'hard', 'work', 'really', 'sets', 'never', 'feel', 'cheap', 'outdoor', 'locations', 'are', 'also', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'always', 'feels', 'alive', 'scenes', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'sitting', 'idle', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'John', 'Woo', 'moved', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'not', 'long', 'making', 'this.The', 'action', 'top', 'notch', 'choreography', ""n't"", 'absolute', 'best', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'directing', 'editing', 'are', 'superb', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'intense', 'Fung', 'Hak-on', 'fight', 'choreographer', 'best', 'fight', 'movie', 'vs.', 'Wei', 'Pai', 'other', 'fights', 'are', 'good', 'best', 'physical', 'performance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Damian', 'Lau', 'sword', 'skills', 'are', 'course', 'excellent', 'athletic', 'skills', 'also', 'impressed', 'Lee', 'Hoi', 'San', 'great', 'main', 'villain', 'Chien', 'Yuet', 'San', 'show', 'Sleeping', 'Wizard', 'have', 'seen', 'sleeping', 'style', 'used', '4', '5', 'movies', 'far', 'funniest', 'version', 'action', 'not', 'strictly', 'sword', 'fighting', 'great', 'hand', 'hand', 'match', 'Lee', 'Hoi', 'San', 'even', 'sword', 'fights', 'are', 'lot', 'punches.4.5/5The', 'picture', 'quality', 'too', 'bright', 'speckling', 'picture', 'quality', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'Sound', 'quality', 'perfect', 'English', 'dub', 'hard', 'listen', 'luckily', 'original', 'Cantonese', 'track', 'included', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'well', 'written.Special', 'features', 'include', 'great', 'commentary', 'Bey', 'Logan', 'very', 'knowledgable', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'expert', 'tons', 'interesting', 'info', 'one', 'better', 'Dragon', 'Dynasty', 'commentaries', 'have', 'heard.In', '9', 'minute', 'interview', 'Fung', 'Hak-on', 'how', 'came', 'work', 'John', 'Woo', 'also', 'having', 'film', '100', 'strokes', 'single', 'take', 'might', 'seem', 'unbelievable', 'messed', 'up', '99th', 'stroke', 'had', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'ended', 'up', 'taking', 'too', 'long', 'John', 'Woo', 'had', 'edit', 'Filming', 'fight', 'scenes', 'great', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'day', 'two', 'could', 'take', 'year', 'sometimes', 'even', 'longer', 'depending', 'how', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'movie', 'also', 'assistant', 'Chien', 'Yuet', 'Sang', 'crazy', 'sleeping', 'style', 'movie', 'where', 'style', 'came', 'Fung', 'Hak-on', 'definintely', 'best', 'ever', 'fight', 'choreographers', 'always', 'joy', 'hear', 'word', 'say', 'great', 'thing', 'Dragon', 'Dynasty', 'DVDs', 'always', 'get', 'new', 'interviews', 'actors', 'really', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'fan', 'dream', 'come', 'true.The', '11', 'minute', 'interview', 'Lee', 'Hoi', 'San', 'great', 'long', 'friendship', 'Fung', 'Hak-on', 'role', 'movie', 'other', 'things.The', '11', 'minute', 'Legendary', 'Weapons', 'featurette', 'Dragon', 'Dynasty', 'exclusive', 'hosted', 'Bey', 'Logan', 'short', 'descriptions', 'weapons', 'used', 'movie', 'also', 'demonstrations', 'Then', 'Chinese', 'guy', 'more', 'full', 'demonstration', 'excellent', 'special', 'feature', 'Dragon', 'Dynasty.I', 'am', 'stuck', 'should', 'give', 'movie', '4', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'special', 'features', 'easily', 'bump', 'disc', 'up', 'up', '5']",Last Hurrah for Chivalry VHS
