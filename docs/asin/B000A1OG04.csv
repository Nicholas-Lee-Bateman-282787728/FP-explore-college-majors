918704,A28GRFVAA4DU5P,B000A1OG04,A Texas reviewer,"[22, 22]","The previous reviewer obviously doesn't know that this ""movie"" is actually a two hour episode of the short lived series ""The Quest"". The Boudine brothers were seperated as boys when the wagon train their family was traveling with was attacked by the Cheyenne and the boys' parents were killed. The boys each thought the other had died in the attack, Quentin being rescued and raised in the east and Morgan being captured and raised by the Cheyenne (Morgan ""Two Persons"" is not a half-breed even though some people they run into call him one because of the way he is dressed). The brothers are reunited when everyone is massacred in the Cheyenne band that Morgan is living with (the only reason he survives is because the soldiers see his ""bleach blonde hair"" and realize that he is not Cheyenne. In the series the brothers are searching for their younger sister who was also taken by the Cheyenne but was living with a different band than her brother Morgan.Since this is an episode of a television series don't expect an Oscar quailty movie. And, since it is from the '70's it is not politically correct.Still, it is an entertaining flick although definitely not high art. If you like Tim Matheson and/or Kurt Russell you will probably enjoy this ""movie"". If you are a fan of The Quest this may be the only way to get any part of the series on dvd.Update:When I reviewed this dvd in 2006, there were no other releases of any of the rest of this series. I am glad to say that the pilot episode is now available for purchaseThe Quest (Pilot) (1976)Hopefully they will release the rest of the series.",3,"The only episode of ""The Quest"" that has been released on dvd...",1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,1598,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'actually', 'two', 'hour', 'episode', 'short', 'lived', 'series', 'Quest', 'Boudine', 'brothers', 'were', 'seperated', 'boys', 'when', 'wagon', 'train', 'family', 'was', 'traveling', 'was', 'attacked', 'Cheyenne', 'boys', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'boys', 'thought', 'other', 'had', 'died', 'attack', 'Quentin', 'being', 'rescued', 'raised', 'east', 'Morgan', 'being', 'captured', 'raised', 'Cheyenne', 'Morgan', 'Two', 'Persons', 'not', 'half-breed', 'even', 'people', 'run', 'call', 'one', 'way', 'dressed', 'brothers', 'are', 'reunited', 'when', 'everyone', 'massacred', 'Cheyenne', 'band', 'Morgan', 'living', 'only', 'reason', 'soldiers', 'see', 'bleach', 'blonde', 'hair', 'realize', 'not', 'Cheyenne', 'series', 'brothers', 'are', 'searching', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'taken', 'Cheyenne', 'was', 'living', 'different', 'band', 'brother', 'Morgan.Since', 'episode', 'television', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Oscar', 'quailty', 'movie', ""'70"", 'not', 'politically', 'correct.Still', 'entertaining', 'flick', 'definitely', 'not', 'high', 'art', 'like', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'are', 'fan', 'Quest', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'part', 'series', 'dvd.Update', 'When', 'reviewed', 'dvd', '2006', 'were', 'other', 'releases', 'rest', 'series', 'am', 'glad', 'say', 'pilot', 'episode', 'now', 'available', 'purchaseThe', 'Quest', 'Pilot', '1976', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'release', 'rest', 'series']",N/A
