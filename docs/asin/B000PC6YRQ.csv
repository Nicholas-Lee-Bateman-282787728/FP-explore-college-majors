1069696,A1W6YRU1O8581V,B000PC6YRQ,"Cozyjo ""cozyjo""","[4, 7]","I recently saw this on BBC America. First, let me say..I am a die-hard Beatles fan..my favorite being John. As such, I was prepared not to like this documentary at all, probably more out of fear that it may be true than anything else. After all, no one wants to know the dark side of their heroes. It can be very upsetting..To be honest, however..I found it rather intriguing, despite its one-dimensional tone. That is why I gave it three stars. It does the job of what the title says, particularly for those not in the ""know""...but offers up nothing most ""die-hards"" haven't heard before through various sources.Whether one wants to believe what is revealed here or not, the fact remains that the boys' image was a manufactured one, courtesy of Brian. The Beatles (as John often said) ""grew up"" in Hamburg..where sex with hookers and drugs to help fuel their performance stamina was the norm.  These were not the squeaky clean lads that would conquer America. They were young men who came from the hard-scrabbled streets of Liverpool and saw and experienced more of the world than most would give them credit for by the time they hit American shores.I love ""my"" boys..dearly. I place absolutely no judgements upon them. This is why I can look at something like this with an open mind.  I do not see anything earth-shattering about drugs or sexual experimentation. It's all around us, and particularly in the music business (you think The Beatles were exempt from the ""sex, drugs and rock and roll"" lifestyle just because they were Beatles?).  The boys were just four young lads engaging in different experiences and trying to find their way in the world. Same as the rest of us.  The people who want to paint them into a corner and see them as poster children for Mr. Rogers are going to have the biggest problem with this.I have a friend who is Liverpudlian and knew John and his family. She told me things about John, and I believe her. Having had a ""heads-up"" through her and other sources, it was little surprise to me what was revealed here regarding John's ""adventurousness"".  I love ""my"" boy. He is one of the greatest musicians and composers that ever lived..and I think it's a disservice to him when people refuse to see him for the very unique individual that he was.Most die-hard Beatles fans know much of what's in this program, as they've heard it over and over from a number of sources. This is something that others don't wish to believe, and that's fine.  Anyone is free to believe what they choose. Me, I choose to believe that, plain and simply, the boys were just human and having human experiences. They weren't Gods or Saints, nor were they the devil, themselves. Again, I think the people that want to sanitize them are the ones who will have the biggest issue with this program. My friendly advice: Don't sanitize them or vilify them, just LOVE them. After all, they gave so much of their unique talents to the world, and fifty years on, they're still going strong. :)",3,The Beatles as HUMAN,1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,2992,"['recently', 'saw', 'BBC', 'America', 'First', 'let', 'say..I', 'am', 'die-hard', 'Beatles', 'favorite', 'being', 'John', 'such', 'was', 'prepared', 'not', 'like', 'documentary', 'probably', 'more', 'fear', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'anything', 'else', 'one', 'know', 'dark', 'side', 'heroes', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'upsetting..To', 'be', 'honest', 'however..I', 'found', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'one-dimensional', 'tone', 'why', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'job', 'what', 'title', 'particularly', 'not', 'know', 'up', 'nothing', 'most', 'die-hards', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'various', 'one', 'believe', 'what', 'revealed', 'here', 'not', 'fact', 'boys', 'image', 'was', 'manufactured', 'one', 'courtesy', 'Brian', 'Beatles', 'John', 'often', 'said', 'grew', 'up', 'Hamburg..where', 'sex', 'hookers', 'drugs', 'help', 'fuel', 'performance', 'stamina', 'was', 'norm', 'were', 'not', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'lads', 'would', 'conquer', 'America', 'were', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'came', 'hard-scrabbled', 'streets', 'Liverpool', 'saw', 'experienced', 'more', 'world', 'most', 'would', 'give', 'credit', 'time', 'hit', 'American', 'shores.I', 'boys..dearly', 'place', 'absolutely', 'judgements', 'why', 'can', 'look', 'something', 'open', 'mind', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'anything', 'earth-shattering', 'drugs', 'sexual', 'experimentation', 'particularly', 'music', 'business', 'think', 'Beatles', 'were', 'exempt', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'lifestyle', 'just', 'were', 'Beatles', 'boys', 'were', 'just', 'four', 'young', 'lads', 'engaging', 'different', 'experiences', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'world', 'rest', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'paint', 'corner', 'see', 'poster', 'children', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'biggest', 'problem', 'this.I', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'Liverpudlian', 'knew', 'John', 'family', 'told', 'things', 'John', 'believe', 'Having', 'had', 'heads-up', 'other', 'sources', 'was', 'little', 'surprise', 'what', 'was', 'revealed', 'here', 'regarding', 'John', 'adventurousness', 'love', 'boy', 'one', 'greatest', 'musicians', 'composers', 'ever', 'lived..and', 'think', 'disservice', 'when', 'people', 'refuse', 'see', 'very', 'unique', 'individual', 'was.Most', 'die-hard', 'Beatles', 'fans', 'know', 'much', 'what', 'program', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'number', 'sources', 'something', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'believe', 'fine', 'Anyone', 'free', 'believe', 'what', 'choose', 'Me', 'choose', 'believe', 'plain', 'simply', 'boys', 'were', 'just', 'human', 'having', 'human', 'experiences', 'were', ""n't"", 'Gods', 'Saints', 'were', 'devil', 'Again', 'think', 'people', 'want', 'sanitize', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'biggest', 'issue', 'program', 'friendly', 'advice', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sanitize', 'vilify', 'just', 'LOVE', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'unique', 'talents', 'world', 'fifty', 'years', ""'re"", 'still', 'going', 'strong']",Beatles' Biggest Secrets
1069697,A4RGZIX3FVQ0Y,B000PC6YRQ,Joyce,"[4, 7]","just finished watching ""Beatles' Biggest Secrets"" on DVD. Wanted to make the following comments:  there was a comment made that all Beatles music is controlled by the company the members set up.  This comment was made in a negative context.  Isn't that the way it usually works?  Isn't that the way it should work?  Comment by Alan Williams of Paul owing him 15 quid:  Please, get over it!  Maybe he forgot about it!  Comment by Rosemarie McGinnity re: a very early recording by the Beatles; something like ""they look o.k., but what about the music?  Recording was early in their career, and sounded fine to me.  Comment by announcer that John's ""Lost Weekend"" was a ""happy"" time:  I believe John himself said he was ""miserable"".  He was drinking like a teenager, taking drugs, and was out of control.  He was even kicked out of nightclubs for fighting, or acting up.  Many others said John was a violent drunk, and crying to go home and depressed.  This does not sound like it was a ""happy"" time to me.  May Pang makes a comment about John, that he had been discussing maybe working with Paul again (to which she replied she thought that would be ""wonderful"").  Then she says he went back to Yoko, even though she knew he still loved her.  She says all thoughts of working with Paul stopped.  Then she suddenly says, ""we could have had it"", and starts crying.  Then says, ""I'm sorry I'm crying"".  ""We could have had it!""  What is she referring to?  Her relationship with John, or that Paul and John could have possibly written some songs together?  I was puzzled as to her remark, and was disturbed if she was referring to John and Paul's possible collaboration.  ""We could have had it!""????? ""We"" who, and isn't that a private matter between John and Paul?  ""We"", if she means the ""fans"", do not own them!  I believe they gave everything they had to be ""Beatles"" and in the process, created some beautiful music that we are lucky enough to be able to hear and enjoy.  Isn't that enough?  I understand that John once said something to the effect of ""don't they (the fans) know we gave every sodden thing we had, just to be ""The Beatles""?  Wasn't that enough?  In the end, he was killed for being ""A Beatle""!  Wasn't that enough?I feel they all gave everything they had and more, and although they were not perfect (who is?), they should all be proud of the beautiful, inspiring, and powerful music they created for all people to enjoy for all time.  For me, that is more than enough.  If I could say one thing to all of them as individuals (John and George included), I would say ""thank you, the privilege was ours!""As far as the overall DVD is concerned, I found nothing new.  The 'biggest secrets"" were not secrets at all.  I enjoyed watching some of the footage, but nothing shocking here.  All the same old thing, and all predictable, given their age when they started, their fame, and all of the craziness that followed them wherever they went, I would say they acted pretty normal, all things considered.  I don't believe that anyone could be as famous as they were/are, be exposed to all kinds of stuff they were exposed to (drugs, alcohol, sex), have the means and the power to get it, have it thrown at them everywhere they went, and not do it!  Frankly, I am surprised that they didn't lose their minds in the process!  Secrets can only be secrets if nobody knows about them.  I think almost everybody knows about all of these....",2,"Review of ""Beatles Biggest Secrets""",1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,3441,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Beatles', 'Biggest', 'Secrets', 'DVD', 'Wanted', 'make', 'following', 'comments', 'was', 'comment', 'made', 'Beatles', 'music', 'controlled', 'company', 'members', 'set', 'up', 'comment', 'was', 'made', 'negative', 'context', ""n't"", 'way', 'usually', ""n't"", 'way', 'should', 'work', 'Comment', 'Alan', 'Williams', 'Paul', 'owing', '15', 'quid', 'Please', 'get', 'Maybe', 'forgot', 'Comment', 'Rosemarie', 'McGinnity', 're', 'very', 'early', 'recording', 'Beatles', 'something', 'look', 'o.k.', 'what', 'music', 'Recording', 'was', 'early', 'career', 'sounded', 'fine', 'Comment', 'announcer', 'John', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'was', 'happy', 'time', 'believe', 'John', 'said', 'was', 'miserable', 'was', 'drinking', 'teenager', 'taking', 'drugs', 'was', 'control', 'was', 'even', 'kicked', 'nightclubs', 'fighting', 'acting', 'up', 'Many', 'others', 'said', 'John', 'was', 'violent', 'drunk', 'crying', 'go', 'home', 'depressed', 'not', 'sound', 'was', 'happy', 'time', 'May', 'Pang', 'comment', 'John', 'had', 'been', 'discussing', 'maybe', 'working', 'Paul', 'again', 'replied', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'Then', 'went', 'back', 'Yoko', 'even', 'knew', 'still', 'loved', 'thoughts', 'working', 'Paul', 'stopped', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'crying', 'Then', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'m"", 'crying', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'What', 'referring', 'relationship', 'John', 'Paul', 'John', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'written', 'songs', 'together', 'was', 'puzzled', 'remark', 'was', 'disturbed', 'was', 'referring', 'John', 'Paul', 'possible', 'collaboration', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'who', ""n't"", 'private', 'matter', 'John', 'Paul', 'fans', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'believe', 'gave', 'everything', 'had', 'be', 'Beatles', 'process', 'created', 'beautiful', 'music', 'are', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'enjoy', ""n't"", 'enough', 'understand', 'John', 'once', 'said', 'something', 'effect', 'do', ""n't"", 'fans', 'know', 'gave', 'sodden', 'thing', 'had', 'just', 'be', 'Beatles', 'Was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'end', 'was', 'killed', 'being', 'Beatle', 'Was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'feel', 'gave', 'everything', 'had', 'more', 'were', 'not', 'perfect', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'powerful', 'music', 'created', 'people', 'enjoy', 'time', 'more', 'enough', 'could', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'individuals', 'John', 'George', 'included', 'would', 'say', 'thank', 'privilege', 'was', 'ours', 'As', 'far', 'overall', 'DVD', 'concerned', 'found', 'nothing', 'new', ""'biggest"", 'secrets', 'were', 'not', 'secrets', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'footage', 'nothing', 'shocking', 'here', 'same', 'old', 'thing', 'predictable', 'given', 'age', 'when', 'started', 'fame', 'craziness', 'followed', 'wherever', 'went', 'would', 'say', 'acted', 'pretty', 'normal', 'things', 'considered', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'famous', 'were/are', 'be', 'exposed', 'kinds', 'stuff', 'were', 'exposed', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'sex', 'have', 'means', 'power', 'get', 'have', 'thrown', 'everywhere', 'went', 'not', 'do', 'Frankly', 'am', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'minds', 'process', 'Secrets', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'secrets', 'nobody', 'think', 'almost', 'everybody']",Beatles' Biggest Secrets
