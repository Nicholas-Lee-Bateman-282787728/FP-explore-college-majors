But I was determined to find truth and I found it by studying The Bible and Creationism. It takes more faith to be atheist and an evolutionist than to believe in the Creator of the universe.

Don't get me wrong, I've been blessed by Josh McDowell and his testimony, but most of this movie is about his lost life.  Only a few minutes at the end of the film address his saved life.  The problem is that Josh McDowell's lost life is very disturbing, and this movie just didn't handle the facts carefully enough.  Mr. McDowell was sexually abused as a child, and that part of his life in this film was shockingly disturbing.  Even a child could tell what was going on it's so obvious, right down to the sound of his pants zipper being pulled down.  It's really too much for us.  The movie might have been worth it if as much attention was given to his saved life as to his lost life, but that's not how it went.
