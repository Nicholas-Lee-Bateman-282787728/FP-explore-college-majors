187974,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1572528060,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","`La Collectionneuse' is the third film in Eric Rohmer's `Six Morality Tales, but it isn't dependent on the other five films in order to make an impact.  In fact, I've yet to see any of the other films, and I was spellbound by this one from start to finish.The film centers on three people and their forced interactions and how their initial perceptions of each other shifts over the course of the film and their relationships blossom into somewhat destructive although alluring devises.  Adrien and Daniel are friends who vacation together to a Mediterranean villa, hoping to escape everything and do nothing.  Their idea of solitude is disturbed by the presence of a young girl named Haydee who was invited by the villa's owner to stay herself, and her constant interchange of lovers is repulsive, alarming and ultimately intriguing to the two men.  Both Adrien and Daniel become enticed by her in different ways, and eventually Adrien finds himself at a strange crossroads.The film, in some ways, reminded me of `Jules et Jim', especially in the finale and Adrien's abrupt reaction, but the film isn't as universally developed as the later.  Still, the impact is undeniable, and the way that Rohmer shapes his themes in the very fabric of the film (the cinematography is remarkably astute and pulls the audience into each frame) is hard to shake.  The performances across the board are wonderful, especially that of Daniel Pommereulle who has some nice counterpoints to the observations made by Adrien.At the end of the day, `La Collectionneuse' asks some daring questions about sexuality and morality and even plays with the film's title in a way that I didn't expect.Just who is collecting who?",5,A thought provoking classic...,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,1698,"['La', 'Collectionneuse', 'third', 'film', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'Six', 'Morality', 'Tales', ""n't"", 'dependent', 'other', 'five', 'films', 'order', 'make', 'impact', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'was', 'spellbound', 'one', 'start', 'finish.The', 'film', 'centers', 'three', 'people', 'forced', 'interactions', 'how', 'initial', 'perceptions', 'other', 'shifts', 'course', 'film', 'relationships', 'blossom', 'somewhat', 'destructive', 'alluring', 'devises', 'Adrien', 'Daniel', 'are', 'friends', 'who', 'vacation', 'together', 'Mediterranean', 'villa', 'hoping', 'escape', 'everything', 'do', 'nothing', 'idea', 'solitude', 'disturbed', 'presence', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Haydee', 'who', 'was', 'invited', 'villa', 'owner', 'stay', 'constant', 'interchange', 'lovers', 'repulsive', 'alarming', 'ultimately', 'intriguing', 'two', 'men', 'Adrien', 'Daniel', 'become', 'enticed', 'different', 'ways', 'eventually', 'Adrien', 'strange', 'crossroads.The', 'film', 'ways', 'reminded', 'Jules', 'et', 'Jim', 'especially', 'finale', 'Adrien', 'abrupt', 'reaction', 'film', ""n't"", 'universally', 'developed', 'later', 'Still', 'impact', 'undeniable', 'way', 'Rohmer', 'themes', 'very', 'fabric', 'film', 'cinematography', 'remarkably', 'astute', 'audience', 'frame', 'hard', 'shake', 'performances', 'board', 'are', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'Daniel', 'Pommereulle', 'who', 'nice', 'counterpoints', 'observations', 'made', 'Adrien.At', 'end', 'day', 'La', 'Collectionneuse', 'daring', 'questions', 'sexuality', 'morality', 'even', 'plays', 'film', 'title', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect.Just', 'who', 'collecting', 'who']",La Collectionneuse

Yes, the girl too. She's not good enough of an actress to bring off her character. There is no hint of real intelligence there, just naivete. The male characters are some of the most loathsome in Rohmer's body of work. Everyone in the film suffers from a mild case of sociopathic narcissism... but isn't that one of the delights of Rohmer? His dialogue is as witty and sharp as in anything else he's done but at the same time the film lacks the charm of his other work as well as the gravitas of My Night At Maud's for example. The cinematography is rich and evocative of the environment as one would expect from Nestor Almendros. The film's style is light and breezy enough to be eminently watchable even when all the characters are acting like jerks. That people like this exist is depressing yet true. Deep down they all hate themselves, one can be sure of that.I would have actually preferred the whole film to be about the male lead and his self-absorption. Have him spend a month at the villa and the beach, sticking to his set goal of doing nothing, thinking nothing, while musing philosophically via narration. That would have been quite an effort for Rohmer to pull off. Of course he wanted to go the route of the moral dilemma or comedy and introduce the girl and raise up some conflict. Whatever... this is one of the weaker efforts from this director but still worthwhile for lovers of French cinema.",3,"Eric Rohmer's Collector Girl, 3.5 stars",1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,1546,"['hour', 'film', 'viewer', 'fantasize', 'punching', 'smug', 'pretentious', 'self-absorbed', 'creeps', 'face', 'Yes', 'girl', 'too', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'actress', 'bring', 'off', 'character', 'hint', 'real', 'intelligence', 'there', 'just', 'naivete', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'loathsome', 'Rohmer', 'body', 'work', 'Everyone', 'film', 'suffers', 'mild', 'case', 'sociopathic', 'narcissism', ""n't"", 'one', 'delights', 'Rohmer', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'sharp', 'anything', 'else', 'done', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'charm', 'other', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'gravitas', 'My', 'Night', 'Maud', 'example', 'cinematography', 'rich', 'evocative', 'environment', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Nestor', 'Almendros', 'film', 'style', 'light', 'breezy', 'enough', 'be', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'even', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'acting', 'jerks', 'people', 'exist', 'depressing', 'yet', 'true', 'Deep', 'hate', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'that.I', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'preferred', 'whole', 'film', 'be', 'male', 'lead', 'self-absorption', 'Have', 'spend', 'month', 'villa', 'beach', 'sticking', 'set', 'goal', 'doing', 'nothing', 'thinking', 'nothing', 'musing', 'philosophically', 'narration', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'effort', 'Rohmer', 'pull', 'off', 'course', 'wanted', 'go', 'route', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'comedy', 'introduce', 'girl', 'raise', 'up', 'conflict', 'one', 'weaker', 'efforts', 'director', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'lovers', 'French', 'cinema']",La Collectionneuse

There are at least three themes: the value of a bohemian life, free gratification of sex, and relationships.We are introduced to Haydee at the outset of the film. The camera watches Haydee for more than a few minutes as she walks a beach in the slimmest of bikinis. She seems engrossed in thought, somewhat sad, feeling alone. The camera dwells on each part of her beautiful body, feel, legs, stomach, breasts, arms, neck, and face. She is very attractive and graceful.We then meet a handsome man, Adrien. We see his flat stomach frequently and his chest and face. He tells his friends that he wants to leave England, go to a friend's chateau in France, and do nothing in seclusion, for his friend is not there.Haydee visits and is allowed to stay. She is with a boy and has noisy sex with him nightly. Adrien chases the boy away because of the noise. Haydee seems indifferent, and has male friends pick her up every night, a different one each night, and does not return until morning. Adrien sees her as a collector of men; hence the title of the film. He acts as if he is indifferent, but comes to think that Haydee is trying to seduce him.At the end of the film Haydee agrees to sleep with him. Will he do so? If not, why not?  What does Adrien need? Haydee says that she never gets what she wants. What does Haydee really want or need? Will she ever get it?",5,This is a superb must-see film,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,1514,"['superb', 'French', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'borders', 'being', 'artistic', 'certainly', 'causing', 'viewers', 'think', 'enjoying', 'what', 'see', 'are', 'least', 'three', 'themes', 'value', 'bohemian', 'life', 'free', 'gratification', 'sex', 'relationships.We', 'are', 'introduced', 'Haydee', 'outset', 'film', 'camera', 'Haydee', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'beach', 'slimmest', 'bikinis', 'engrossed', 'thought', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'feeling', 'alone', 'camera', 'part', 'beautiful', 'body', 'feel', 'legs', 'stomach', 'breasts', 'arms', 'neck', 'face', 'very', 'attractive', 'graceful.We', 'then', 'meet', 'handsome', 'man', 'Adrien', 'see', 'flat', 'stomach', 'frequently', 'chest', 'face', 'friends', 'leave', 'England', 'go', 'friend', 'chateau', 'France', 'do', 'nothing', 'seclusion', 'friend', 'not', 'there.Haydee', 'visits', 'allowed', 'stay', 'boy', 'noisy', 'sex', 'nightly', 'Adrien', 'boy', 'away', 'noise', 'Haydee', 'indifferent', 'male', 'friends', 'pick', 'up', 'night', 'different', 'one', 'night', 'not', 'return', 'morning', 'Adrien', 'collector', 'men', 'hence', 'title', 'film', 'indifferent', 'think', 'Haydee', 'trying', 'seduce', 'end', 'film', 'Haydee', 'sleep', 'Will', 'do', 'so', 'not', 'why', 'not', 'What', 'Adrien', 'need', 'Haydee', 'never', 'what', 'What', 'Haydee', 'really', 'want', 'need', 'Will', 'ever', 'get']",La Collectionneuse

A moralist is someone who is interested in what is happening inside a person, moods and feelings. People are intelligent thinkers wrapped around and inside their own egos. Men say that Haydee is a collector, which she's not, neither  something which can be collected. She is simply searching as natural relationship to other people as possible.

187978,A220FJEQNGMSRN,1572528060,Trevor Willsmer,"[2, 3]","Although much aclaimed on its first release, seen today La Collectionneuse seems easily the weakest link in Eric Rohmer's series of Six Moral Tales. While it does take the series into darker territory, its insufferably smug male leads and the hideous droning delivery of the female lead (who ties with Marie-France Pisier for the most annoying voice in French cinema) make it a real chore to watch at times. The fact that it's the film that Neil LaBute has spent a career remaking hardly warmed me to it either. Yes, it's about superficial people, but it skims perilously close to becoming as superficial as they are by overindulging their sense of self-importance. For cameo spotters, Performance director Donald Cammell can be briefly glimpsed in the film's St. Tropez scenes.",3,The weak link in the Six Moral Tales,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,778,"['much', 'aclaimed', 'first', 'release', 'seen', 'today', 'La', 'Collectionneuse', 'easily', 'weakest', 'link', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'series', 'Six', 'Moral', 'Tales', 'take', 'series', 'darker', 'territory', 'insufferably', 'smug', 'male', 'leads', 'hideous', 'droning', 'delivery', 'female', 'lead', 'who', 'Marie-France', 'Pisier', 'most', 'annoying', 'voice', 'French', 'cinema', 'make', 'real', 'chore', 'watch', 'times', 'fact', 'film', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'spent', 'career', 'remaking', 'hardly', 'warmed', 'either', 'Yes', 'superficial', 'people', 'perilously', 'close', 'becoming', 'as', 'superficial', 'are', 'overindulging', 'sense', 'self-importance', 'cameo', 'spotters', 'Performance', 'director', 'Donald', 'Cammell', 'can', 'be', 'briefly', 'glimpsed', 'film', 'St.', 'Tropez', 'scenes']",La Collectionneuse
