I've never heard of anyone else doing that. Granted they did so in a way that was hilarious but not as traumatic as you might think for kids. But, they did need to set the stage for tim allen to take over. I won't go into details of the movies as most people know it and the others should experience it for the first time on blu ray without having me inflluence them. The first two are great, and the third is good, way better than it was said to be at the time. The only thing I thought they could have fixed is there is a plot development that puts the hero out in the cold, but it is resolved way too quickly (Martin Short is rather grating at times, I am not a big fan, but Jack Frost is supposed to make you hate him, so that works in his favor). I think they should have made it longer and maybe make it more of a struggle, maybe get allen's character to realise just what he had, and see just how much the children loved him. I think it would have benefited the movie to have taken it's time and worked longer on reaching the turning point. But overall these are great movies. and should be watched over and over.

I remember seeing the first with my dad and brother.  Good memories.  The movies are about a man who is going through a hard time.  Him and his wife are no longer together and he has a hard time figuring out how to act around his son.  Well, It's Christmas and the son is staying with him.  Something happens that changes the mans as well as the sons life.  It is a movie you will always remember.  I could have went into more detail, but I do not want to ruin it for anyone.  This is a great movie for the entire family to watch.  You can watch it again and again.I can not give to much away, as I said I do not want to give to much away.  But the second movie is about the man getting used to his new responsibility.  Not just him, but those who are part of his life.  Also, The man has had his job for about 10 years now.  But there is something that he needs or he may not be able to keep the job.  Do I hear bells?The third movie....  well, the man has someone trying to take his job.  This movie did not seem to fit with the others at all.  It just went a little to far with some of the stuff.  But, if you have seen the first two, you minds well watch the last.  Kids will like the third one.Here are the special features for each movie.  I got this from another site.  So it is accurate as far as I know.

1182602,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B001DPHDBA,Mark Baker,"[1, 1]","These truly are some great movies.  The first one has become an annual tradition for me.Our series stars Tim Allen as Scott Calvin, a divorced dad who doesn't have a good relationship with his son.  In the first movie, a Christmas Eve accident finds Santa dead on Scott's front lawn.  When he puts on Santa's suit to appease Charlie (Eric Lloyd), he finds himself under the Santa clause.  No matter what Scott wants, he is going to become the next Santa.  This is by far the best in the series with lots of spot on laughs.But the time the second movie rolls around, Scott has grown to love his new identity.  So when he comes under the Mrs. Clause, he scrambles to find a wife by Christmas Eve so he can keep being Santa.  Yep, we've got another Christmas romantic comedy.  But it works quite well and is enjoyable.The third movie finds Santa dealing with a disruptive Jack Frost (Martin Short) who wants a holiday of his own.  While he deals with his in-laws and other visiting family, his wife is about ready to have a baby.  Will that be enough to make him trigger the Escape Clause?  This one is more silly and slapstick.  I enjoyed it more on the first viewing.  Again, it doesn't hold up to the original, but it is still fun in its own right.This set contains no new extras.  You get the three individual releases in a box, so if you already have one or more of the films, there's no reason to get this one.  Additionally, if you prefer widescreen movies, you'll want to skip this set since these are the full screen releases.  However, if you don't have these films, this might be your best way to get them.Granted, all three movies are fairly predictable.  But they also offer great Christmas laughs.

The three movies included are:THE SANTA CLAUSE-Scott Calvin is a divorced Dad. Much to his ex-wife's chagrin, his six-year old son still believes in Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, an unexpected visitor falls off of Scott's roof. All that remains of the visitor is a sleigh and eight reindeer on Scott's roof, a red and white furry coat, and instructions that if involved with the accident to put the coat on.  Scott does and soon finds himself zipping around the world delivering packages through chimneys. He eventually winds up at the North Pole and is informed by a group of elves that he's the new Santa. Scott believes the whole thing is a dream and goes about his regular life. But as the year progresses Scott's hair turns grey, he gains a ton of weight, and his face doesn't stay shaved. Scott has to either accept his new job or disappoint children around the world, including his own son. Special features include ""So You Wanna Be an Elf?""; Santa's Helper - a trivia adventure game; and ""Making Santa snacks with Wolfgang"".THE SANTA CLAUSE 2: THE MRS. CLAUSE--Eight years have passed since Scott Calvin became the new Santa Claus and the elves at the North Pole think he's the best Santa ever.  But there's a problem. It turns out there's another clause to the agreement that Scott made years ago and Santa has to be married. Santa has a year to find a wife and get married. Otherwise the elves' favorite Santa will be gone with no memory of what has happened. Special features include deleted scenes; a gag reel; ""Operation Toy Box: Save Santa"" set-top game; and the making-of featurette ""Inside the North Pole With Curtis"".THE SANTA CLAUSE 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE--Things have been going smooth at the North Pole for over a decade. Santa has taken a prominent place at the Council of Mythical Leaders and has been a strong opponent to Jack Frost.  Frost doesn't like it and believes if he was Santa, the world would be a much better place. His cold heart leads him to discover one last clause to the Santa agreement. If he can get Santa to say a particular phrase he will be zipped back through time to the moment he became Santa and someone else can take his place. Frost plots his move carefully and Santa soon finds himself zipping through time and living as Scott Calvin in a miserable world that would make Mr. Potter from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE very, very happy. Special features include a blooper reel; alternate opening scene; ""On the Set with Tim and Marty""; Christmas carol-oke; and ""Greatest Time of Year"" music video with Aly and AJ.THE SANTA CLAUSE is the best of the movies in the set and the films progressively decrease in story development and entertainment value through the series.The only major complaint I have about the set is that the films are all in fullscreen with no widescreen option. I prefer watching movies on my regular television in the widesreen format.Overall this is a nice holiday collection available at a reasonable price.
