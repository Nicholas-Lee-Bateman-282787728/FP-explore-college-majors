990525,A4MF6S6TSGS8T,B000FIGJ84,F. Gwin,"[2, 2]","Generally I am very much against conspiracy theories. Men like Mike Hoggard and Alex Jones make my skin crawl when I think about the crazy stories that they spin. However, Christian Pinto is very unique. Rather that pulling his ideas out of thin air with nothing to back him up, he presents his theories based on professional opinions and evidence from history. I very much appreciate the way that he doesn't play to the emotions but rather tries to portray the facts.I found this documentary to be very enlightening and intriguing. The main point of this DVD in particular is to prove that America was heralded as the ""New Atlantis"" (originally spoken of by Solon) by all the secret societies. I think it does a stelar job, especially when speaking of John Dee and Sir Francis Bacon. Pinto also makes a point of examining the arguments from both sides before showing his conclusions. For example, when talking about how he believes that Bacon was the real author of William Shakespeare's theatrical plays, he didn't just go to those who agree with him, rather he also went to others who didn't agree with him in order to hear their arguments first hand.I found this DVD to be very informative and interesting, and I can't wait to watch the next part of the series.",5,"Not Your Run of the Mill ""Conspiracy Theories""",1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,1265,"['Generally', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'Men', 'Mike', 'Hoggard', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'make', 'skin', 'crawl', 'when', 'think', 'crazy', 'stories', 'spin', 'However', 'Christian', 'Pinto', 'very', 'unique', 'pulling', 'ideas', 'thin', 'air', 'nothing', 'back', 'up', 'theories', 'based', 'professional', 'opinions', 'evidence', 'history', 'very', 'much', 'appreciate', 'way', ""n't"", 'play', 'emotions', 'rather', 'tries', 'portray', 'facts.I', 'found', 'documentary', 'be', 'very', 'enlightening', 'intriguing', 'main', 'point', 'DVD', 'particular', 'prove', 'America', 'was', 'heralded', 'New', 'Atlantis', 'originally', 'spoken', 'Solon', 'secret', 'societies', 'think', 'stelar', 'job', 'especially', 'when', 'speaking', 'John', 'Dee', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Bacon', 'Pinto', 'also', 'point', 'examining', 'arguments', 'sides', 'showing', 'conclusions', 'example', 'when', 'talking', 'how', 'Bacon', 'was', 'real', 'author', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'theatrical', 'plays', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'who', 'agree', 'rather', 'also', 'went', 'others', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'order', 'hear', 'arguments', 'first', 'hand.I', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'very', 'informative', 'interesting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'next', 'part', 'series']",Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings:  The New Atlantis -- Volume 1

William Morgan"" segment), some repetitive use of acting segments and they do chase a couple of rabbit trails to nowhere.With that said, the documentary is well worth the money.  There is GREAT information that you will not find in most documentaries regarding the founding of our nation and, I would guess, some information that you will not find anywhere--especially in such a quality program.  I especially appreciated the information on Freemasonry.Most Americans probably have little or no knowledge about the influence of Francis Bacon on our founding.  And I have met few who know the truth about William Shakespeare.

990528,A386NVAVQV5WUO,B000FIGJ84,"Richard D. Cappetto ""RickDC""","[3, 3]","Well, My title is a little provocative, and in fact many Americans know that many of our founders belonged to secret societies and incorporated many esoteric beliefs and symbols into our nation. And this film confirms there always was the side by side aspect of American being a majority Christian nation but at the same time, the elites were dominated by those who belonged to secret societies such as the masons and the order of the Rosy cross.So what turns history upside down? For one thing the fact that 8 masons murdered a man, for reviling there secrets, and got away with it because masons controlled the court system in the USA. Another thing is just who are Who are the masons and what do they want? Also what founders Fathers were members of the Masons? What was the connection with Alister Crowley? Where do the beliefs of the Masons and other secret societies come from? What does Gnostics, Kabbalist, Esoteric Persian religions and Egyptian religion have to do with thee ""modern"" Beliefs? Was George Washington a leading mason? The speculation about Benjamin Franklin is intriguing was he a spy, a loyal American, or a loyal devotee to Frances Bacon and secret societies? The Importance of Frances Bacon. Who was Shakespeare? Did europeans come to the USA as far back as 800 BC? and lastly why was America founded and for what purpose?All those questions and more are answered hear, (including what are the secret societies symbols are and what is there major goal or goals) This is an intriguing watch and I highly recommend this DVD to everyone.",5,America's Beginning's Turns History on its head.,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,1561,"['Well', 'My', 'title', 'little', 'provocative', 'fact', 'many', 'Americans', 'know', 'many', 'founders', 'belonged', 'secret', 'societies', 'incorporated', 'many', 'esoteric', 'beliefs', 'symbols', 'nation', 'film', 'always', 'was', 'side', 'side', 'aspect', 'American', 'being', 'majority', 'Christian', 'nation', 'same', 'time', 'elites', 'were', 'dominated', 'who', 'belonged', 'secret', 'societies', 'such', 'masons', 'order', 'Rosy', 'cross.So', 'what', 'history', 'upside', 'down', 'one', 'thing', 'fact', '8', 'masons', 'murdered', 'man', 'reviling', 'secrets', 'got', 'away', 'masons', 'controlled', 'court', 'system', 'USA', 'thing', 'just', 'who', 'are', 'Who', 'are', 'masons', 'what', 'do', 'want', 'Also', 'what', 'Fathers', 'were', 'members', 'Masons', 'What', 'was', 'connection', 'Alister', 'Crowley', 'Where', 'do', 'beliefs', 'Masons', 'other', 'secret', 'societies', 'come', 'What', 'Gnostics', 'Kabbalist', 'Esoteric', 'Persian', 'religions', 'Egyptian', 'religion', 'have', 'do', 'thee', 'modern', 'Beliefs', 'Was', 'George', 'Washington', 'leading', 'mason', 'speculation', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'intriguing', 'was', 'spy', 'loyal', 'American', 'loyal', 'devotee', 'Frances', 'Bacon', 'secret', 'societies', 'Importance', 'Frances', 'Bacon', 'Who', 'was', 'Shakespeare', 'Did', 'come', 'USA', 'far', 'back', '800', 'BC', 'lastly', 'why', 'was', 'America', 'founded', 'what', 'purpose', 'questions', 'more', 'are', 'answered', 'hear', 'including', 'are', 'secret', 'societies', 'symbols', 'are', 'what', 'there', 'major', 'goal', 'goals', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'everyone']",Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings:  The New Atlantis -- Volume 1

990530,A2GA7FLT91IWLV,B000FIGJ84,thechrisaccount,"[30, 33]","This is a great documentary, filled with powerful and unique information not included in most histories of America.  The 1-star reviewer who has criticized the film mentions issues that mostly appear nowhere on screen.  He is drawing conclusions based upon his personal suspicions, rather than any concrete evidence pertaining to the film.  ""Gord"" suggests that producer, David Bay, is in support of the Ecumenical Movement -- but fails to mention that Bay's Cutting Edge website ([...]) strongly condemns Rome, the Vatican, and the Ecumenical movement (check out the ""Thus Saith Rome"" section of the site).  Bay also does not support Pat Robertson, but exposes him as one of the pastors who has taken money from Rev. Sun Yung Moon (a false teacher who says that he is greater than Jesus Christ).Furthermore, this film NOWHERE mentions the King James Bible, neither does it suggest (AT ALL) that Francis Bacon ""translated"" the KJV (a popular belief among occultists).  Also, the film's writer/director, Christian J. Pinto, is a strong supporter of the King James translation -- something ""Gord"" seems unaware of.  Meanwhile, the leading Baconian scholar in the film (Peter Dawkins) has stated elsewhere that ""no records"" exist of Bacon's involvement with the KJV, and that the KJV translators are well known and that Bacon was not among them.  David Bay has likewise repeated this information in at least one radio interview.  While Bay's views on the KJV are controversial, his contention is not with the translation, but rather, with the esoteric artwork drawn onto the pages of the early KJV editions (which are beyond dispute).But the real story with ""Secret Mysteries"" has to do with the influence of Sir Francis Bacon on the founding of America, through the secret societies of Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism.  The film reveals that while Christians came to America through the Puritan/Pilgrim movement, they were not alone.  With them came certain esoteric groups that believed America was destined to become a philosophic empire that would one day extend to all the world.  What the film is really telling us is that Bacon's ""New Atlantis"" and the current drive toward a ""New World Order"" are one and the same thing.Also, the film reveals that Bacon referred to himself as the ""Herald of the New Age"" who came to herald ""the coming of the Christ"" (according to Peter Dawkins).  As such, Bacon's New Atlantis was designed to lay the groundwork for what will eventually become the kingdom of Antichrist -- prophesied in the Bible.
