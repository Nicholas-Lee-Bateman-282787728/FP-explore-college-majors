It's interesting to watch very talented chefs from the past seasons battling it out and also seeing how their personalities mesh. Favorites like Richard Blaze, Fabio and Carla have returned.

Vegan,"[6, 6]","It usually takes me a few episodes to get into a season, possibly because I usually have to spend the first few episodes deciding what chefs I like that season. This season is all returning chefs from previous seasons, so I already had favorites going in, though some of the cheftestants I really liked in their respective seasons dissapointed and annoyed me this time around, and vice versa. The challenges always pushed the chefs to their limit this season, and were very entertaining to watch.",5,Best Season of Top Chef Yet,1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,496,"['usually', 'few', 'episodes', 'get', 'season', 'possibly', 'usually', 'have', 'spend', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'deciding', 'what', 'chefs', 'season', 'season', 'returning', 'chefs', 'previous', 'seasons', 'already', 'had', 'favorites', 'going', 'cheftestants', 'really', 'liked', 'respective', 'seasons', 'dissapointed', 'annoyed', 'time', 'vice', 'versa', 'challenges', 'always', 'pushed', 'chefs', 'limit', 'season', 'were', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch']",N/A
