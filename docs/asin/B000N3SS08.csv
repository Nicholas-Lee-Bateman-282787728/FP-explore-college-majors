If i was on a island & could only watch the BH or Andy Griffith i would choose the Hillbillies. This set doesnt have the original music to the opening credits but who cares. The quality isnt bad & i read the other choices is either you have to buy 2 sets to equal this one or buy a overpriced season 1 on dvd-r from Henning. I think this release is only missing one episode from season 1 which is the main reason to buy this set. Since im just a poor out of work buyer i chose this one instead of paying double to have season 1 elsewhere.

In fact I have them all on a collection of other sets and the quality is good considering.

I did try them out and they worked fine but it the principal of the thing don't send me something loose when you pick it up before mailing it.
