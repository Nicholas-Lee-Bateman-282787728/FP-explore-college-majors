What I can see is that there is another story that could also be a liking among children or adults. The story talks about the long hardship love of prince and princess where in the end they met. The peasant girl or princess is often locked up by their parents at thome and one day get to sneak out and the story .........this form of story had advantage isthat you can add christmas edition for this animation film or even talk about the life of the princess at outside world before she get to met the prince etc etc as the story goes. We can give it a namje to this animation film done by Waltz Disnet animation group called Rapzel.

Anyway the stories are cute and it gives us a little insight tonwhat belles life was like I the castle, those months that she was there.

731797,A3A3RB38KY7WTM,B00007LVCT,E. Antic,"[8, 12]","Readers and shoppers alike have to understand that this film justifies many of the complaints it has received by other Amazon members. I have a BA in animation and am a long time Disney fan. However this work represents the all time low Disney is able to hit these days. It is a series of three cartoon shorts, and every story teaches ""a lesson"". That may sound like a good idea for a children's film, but it fails in this DVD miserably. Disney may indeed make 'kids movies' but a great many adults love them too. They market many things to adults, and overall one would hope you could pick up ANY Disney movie and be entertained even a bit.  No wonder so many adult Beauty and the Beast fans will no doubt be disappointed in what the DVD has to offer. I consider myself a diehard Beauty and the Beast fan. I own the VHS...I will not buy the DVD. Truth be told if you're a fan it's best not to expose yourself to this, it's not worth the extra screen time of your favorite characters no matter how much you think it is.In the first episode, ""The Perfect World"", Belle and the Beast get into a fight over dinner. Neither will apologize. A rather boring new group of servants is introduced, and they decide to fake an apology on behalf of the Beast to make things right. They are discovered and things become worse ending in everyone learning about the importance of forgiveness.The second episode is ""Fifi's Folly"" The feather duster &  Lumiere are about to celebrate their anniversary. Lumiere is nervous and doesn't know what to do or say and asks for Belle's help. It strikes me as incredibly odd that Lumiere of all people would lack romantic wit and ideas for an anniversary. The first two films paint him as a suave multi-dating he-man of the romance world. So the fact that he needs help is a pathetic story line. As the story goes on Fifi mistakes Belle's help in the matter to be a romantic affair between Belle & Lumiere. She promptly decides to leave the castle for good (and she will go where now?). Of course in the end we all learn about the value of trust.The third episode is ""Broken Wing."" Belle misses a lunch date with the Beast when she finds a wounded bird to the dismay of the servants. As it seems..the Beast hates all animals especially birds. (Beast liked birds enough when He and Belle fed them in the movie?!)  When Beast discovers her reason for having stood him up he becomes furious and demands the bird be caged as his prisoner and demands it sing for his pleasure. Of course the bird is unhappy and will not sing. Belle pleads for him to release the bird and we are all shown the value of freedom.When this was brought to DVD an additional story was added called ""Mrs. Potts' Party"". I have not seen this as I own the VHS. However the voice of Mrs. Potts is a very poor knock off of the original that even your kids won't dismiss. (a really really poor knock off) So I can't imagine why anyone would decide to give this character enough screen time to have their own episode, but they did.In conclusion those who say it's a direct to video and not meant to be taken, or mistaken, for the original I disagree. Disney has along record of meeting certain standards...and people expect their films to live up to a certain standard. Certainly this isn't a full length theater release. I don't think ~any~ adult would think it was. However compared to the Rerun of Jafar, or even the TV series The Little Mermaid & Aladdin had....it's an incredibly weak film with little to no entertainment value. Yes is was made for kids...but is that really an excuse for Disney hitting rock bottom? This ladies and gents IS the rock bottom for Disney, and it's very sad that it has happened. If you are opposed to DtV films...STOP BUYING THEM. Disney makes them cheaply and reaps huge profits. Do your part to stop poor animation...rent them if you have to, but don't buy them.",1,Not worth the paper it was animated on,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,3889,"['Readers', 'shoppers', 'alike', 'have', 'understand', 'film', 'many', 'complaints', 'received', 'other', 'Amazon', 'members', 'have', 'BA', 'animation', 'am', 'long', 'time', 'Disney', 'fan', 'However', 'work', 'time', 'low', 'Disney', 'able', 'hit', 'days', 'series', 'three', 'cartoon', 'shorts', 'story', 'lesson', 'may', 'sound', 'good', 'idea', 'children', 'film', 'DVD', 'miserably', 'Disney', 'may', 'indeed', 'make', ""'kids"", 'movies', 'great', 'many', 'adults', 'love', 'too', 'market', 'many', 'things', 'adults', 'overall', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'ANY', 'Disney', 'movie', 'be', 'entertained', 'even', 'bit', 'wonder', 'so', 'many', 'adult', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'fans', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'disappointed', 'what', 'DVD', 'offer', 'consider', 'diehard', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'fan', 'own', 'VHS', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', ""'re"", 'fan', 'best', 'not', 'expose', 'not', 'worth', 'extra', 'screen', 'time', 'favorite', 'characters', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'think', 'first', 'episode', 'Perfect', 'World', 'Belle', 'Beast', 'get', 'fight', 'dinner', 'will', 'apologize', 'rather', 'boring', 'new', 'group', 'servants', 'introduced', 'decide', 'fake', 'apology', 'behalf', 'Beast', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'are', 'discovered', 'things', 'become', 'worse', 'ending', 'everyone', 'learning', 'importance', 'forgiveness.The', 'second', 'episode', 'Fifi', 'Folly', 'feather', 'duster', 'Lumiere', 'are', 'celebrate', 'anniversary', 'Lumiere', 'nervous', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'say', 'asks', 'Belle', 'help', 'incredibly', 'Lumiere', 'people', 'would', 'lack', 'romantic', 'wit', 'ideas', 'anniversary', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'paint', 'suave', 'multi-dating', 'he-man', 'romance', 'world', 'fact', 'help', 'pathetic', 'story', 'line', 'story', 'Fifi', 'mistakes', 'Belle', 'help', 'matter', 'be', 'romantic', 'affair', 'Belle', 'Lumiere', 'promptly', 'leave', 'castle', 'good', 'will', 'go', 'where', 'now', 'course', 'end', 'learn', 'value', 'trust.The', 'third', 'episode', 'Broken', 'Wing', 'Belle', 'lunch', 'date', 'Beast', 'when', 'wounded', 'bird', 'dismay', 'servants', 'seems..the', 'Beast', 'hates', 'animals', 'especially', 'birds', 'Beast', 'liked', 'birds', 'enough', 'when', 'Belle', 'fed', 'movie', 'When', 'Beast', 'reason', 'having', 'stood', 'up', 'furious', 'bird', 'be', 'caged', 'prisoner', 'sing', 'pleasure', 'course', 'bird', 'unhappy', 'will', 'not', 'sing', 'Belle', 'pleads', 'release', 'bird', 'are', 'shown', 'value', 'freedom.When', 'was', 'brought', 'DVD', 'additional', 'story', 'was', 'added', 'called', 'Mrs.', 'Potts', 'Party', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'own', 'VHS', 'However', 'voice', 'Mrs.', 'Potts', 'very', 'poor', 'knock', 'original', 'even', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'really', 'really', 'poor', 'knock', 'off', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'decide', 'give', 'character', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'have', 'own', 'episode', 'did.In', 'conclusion', 'who', 'say', 'direct', 'video', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'mistaken', 'original', 'disagree', 'Disney', 'along', 'record', 'meeting', 'certain', 'standards', 'people', 'expect', 'films', 'live', 'up', 'certain', 'standard', 'Certainly', ""n't"", 'full', 'length', 'theater', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', '~any~', 'adult', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'However', 'compared', 'Rerun', 'Jafar', 'even', 'TV', 'series', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Aladdin', 'had', '.it', 'incredibly', 'weak', 'film', 'little', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Yes', 'was', 'made', 'kids', 'really', 'excuse', 'Disney', 'hitting', 'rock', 'bottom', 'ladies', 'gents', 'rock', 'bottom', 'Disney', 'very', 'sad', 'happened', 'are', 'opposed', 'DtV', 'films', 'STOP', 'BUYING', 'THEM', 'Disney', 'cheaply', 'reaps', 'huge', 'profits', 'Do', 'part', 'stop', 'poor', 'animation', 'rent', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",N/A

It is a midquel that takes place in the timeline of the original movie (after Christmas, but before the fight with Gaston). It is the 3rd film in the series.The movie is split into 4 segments. ''The Perfect Word'', ''Fiffi's Folly'', ''Mrs. Potts' Party'', and ''Broken Wing''. Each segment is around 22 minutes long. The movie is really sweet and has nice morals to it. It also introduces us to a few new characters.''The Perfect Word'' and ''Broken Wing'' involve Beast trying to cope with his anger and trying to understand Belle and the others. In ''Fiffi's Folly'', it is almost Fiffi and Lumiere's anniversary, Belle wants to help Lumiere plan his anniversary, but then Fiffi thinks Lumiere is falling for Belle. In ''Mrs. Potts' Party'', Mrs. Potts is depressed because of the weather, and everyone wants to try to make her happy by throwing a party. But they have to be careful not to wake the Beast since he was up all night fixing a leak in the roof.Beast can be a bully sometimes. He tends to bully people when things don't go his way, but he tries to cope with his anger and understand them. He also admits that he can be difficult.Some scenes are quite funny, like when Cogsworth is trying to speak to all the plates, butter knives, and pots, but then they suddenly all start fighting while loud classical music plays in the background^^.

Williams ""www.justinwilliams.co.uk""","[29, 36]","Arriving in today's post Disney's Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World SE on DVD was a surprise as I had forgotten I had ordered it. The cover is very nice and you can imagine how delighted I was (as a 24 year old male) to have a Belle compact mirror attached to it to add to the excitement.The DVD loads up showing trailers for Finding Nemo, Stanley March 11th, Lion King SE, Sleeping Beauty SE (with no more news on a release date) as well as the Disney Princess toys/clothing trailer.The nicely animated view of the castle acts at the animated dvd menu. The animation here features swallows oddly flying through falling snow?! Whatever, it's pretty and marked with SFX as well as a subtle underscoring musical narrative from the feature.Bonus features include Belle's Delightful Dinner Game which actually transpires to a three screen static hide and seek game. Once completed a series of 8 questions to light eight candles results in footage from the feature of Belle and Beast eating dinner.Disney's Song Collection is less of a collection as two unmemorable songs which can be played with onscreen lyrics. Yawn.The truly spectacular thing here is the Enchanted Environment - it's an animated change of season taken from the very beginning of the original Beauty and the Beast - the bit with the parting trees and the waterfall. Birds fly, trees blow, snow falls, icicles form, dappled light penetrates through the forest and mists come and go. The music has a very relaxing non-synth sound and you can toggle between five soundtracks or just the SFX. It is probably the best feature of the disc. I love it.As for the feature I am actually quite disgusted. The dust grains on the feature are too often and too bad for a DVD SPECIAL EDITION!!! I bought Fritz Lang's Metropolis made in 1927 which has a cleaner presentation. The additional CGI linking each tale really does no favours and merely highlights the varied quality - Belle looks disfigured sometimes due to a lack of continuity in her animation. 22 minutes are added and these are pretty good - again making the rest look inferior.Sneak peeks allow you to view the aforementioned trailers as well as those for the future Kiki's Delivery Service, Stitch! The Movie and Tuck Everlasting.

731808,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00007LVCT,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[26, 28]","I find it interesting that many of the reactions to this collection of shorts are extremely hostile.  The shorts are not that bad, but neither are they that good.  This DVD is much like three Saturday morning cartoons that are in one collection.  My only complaint is that the price of the DVD is quite high for the value received, which may have been the reason some reviewers were upset.The title of the first story is ""The Perfect Word.""  In this story the Beast and Belle disagree and there is a copious amount of rudeness and insensitivity all around.  The story heaps on the need for each of the characters to forgive each other, which I found distracting.  The story made the point early and was relentless in setting up the need for people to apologize and forgive.The second story is ""Fifi's Folly.""  This time Fifi, Lumiere's girlfriend, is upset with Lumiere because she thinks that Belle is trying to steal Lumiere away.  Fifi acts meanly and tries to sabotage the evening that she thinks Belle and Lumiere are going to have.  Of course, the evening is for Fifi and Lumiere and the plan predictably backfires.  Once again the story was heavy-handed because the point was made early in the short, but the point was continually ground in until the final moments of the short.The final story is ""Broken Wing,"" which I found charming in some ways.  Belle rescues a small bird with a broken wing.  The Beast first wants to throw the bird out and then he wants to cage the bird.  I was annoyed that the Beast's behavior was so awful.  I thought that some younger children might find the beast to be terrifying in some places, particularly as the Beast seemed prepared to hurt the bird.  However, the bird was nicely animated and Belle tried her best to get the Beast to be kind.  This story has a nice ending if you can reach it through the Beast's heavy-handed and over-the-top behavior.In addition to the three shorts are a variety of other features on this DVD.  While some of the features are interesting, the value of this DVD should be the ""feature,"" which is not a feature because the three stories are independent stories.  The voices of Robby Benson, Paige O'Hara, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers and others are unable to make this DVD a must have.  The stories are too forced and try too hard to capitalize on the success of the original ""Beauty and the Beast"" movie.  I recommend this movie only to those who must have all the ""Beauty and the Beast"" movies, or all Disney movies.  Everyone else should move on to better Disney movies.",3,Heavy Handed,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,2552,"['find', 'interesting', 'many', 'reactions', 'collection', 'shorts', 'are', 'extremely', 'hostile', 'shorts', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'good', 'DVD', 'much', 'three', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'are', 'one', 'collection', 'only', 'complaint', 'price', 'DVD', 'quite', 'high', 'value', 'received', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'reviewers', 'were', 'upset.The', 'title', 'first', 'story', 'Perfect', 'Word', 'story', 'Beast', 'Belle', 'disagree', 'copious', 'amount', 'rudeness', 'insensitivity', 'around', 'story', 'heaps', 'need', 'characters', 'forgive', 'other', 'found', 'distracting', 'story', 'made', 'point', 'early', 'was', 'relentless', 'setting', 'up', 'need', 'people', 'apologize', 'forgive.The', 'second', 'story', 'Fifi', 'Folly', 'time', 'Fifi', 'Lumiere', 'girlfriend', 'upset', 'Lumiere', 'Belle', 'trying', 'steal', 'Lumiere', 'away', 'Fifi', 'meanly', 'tries', 'sabotage', 'evening', 'Belle', 'Lumiere', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'course', 'evening', 'Fifi', 'Lumiere', 'plan', 'predictably', 'Once', 'again', 'story', 'was', 'heavy-handed', 'point', 'was', 'made', 'early', 'short', 'point', 'was', 'continually', 'ground', 'final', 'moments', 'short.The', 'final', 'story', 'Broken', 'Wing', 'found', 'charming', 'ways', 'Belle', 'small', 'bird', 'broken', 'wing', 'Beast', 'first', 'throw', 'bird', 'then', 'cage', 'bird', 'was', 'annoyed', 'Beast', 'behavior', 'was', 'so', 'awful', 'thought', 'younger', 'children', 'might', 'find', 'beast', 'be', 'terrifying', 'places', 'particularly', 'Beast', 'seemed', 'prepared', 'hurt', 'bird', 'However', 'bird', 'was', 'nicely', 'animated', 'Belle', 'tried', 'best', 'get', 'Beast', 'be', 'kind', 'story', 'nice', 'ending', 'can', 'reach', 'Beast', 'heavy-handed', 'over-the-top', 'behavior.In', 'addition', 'three', 'shorts', 'are', 'variety', 'other', 'features', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'interesting', 'value', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'feature', 'not', 'feature', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'independent', 'stories', 'voices', 'Robby', 'Benson', 'Paige', ""O'Hara"", 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'others', 'are', 'unable', 'make', 'DVD', 'must', 'have', 'stories', 'are', 'too', 'forced', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'capitalize', 'success', 'original', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'movie', 'recommend', 'movie', 'only', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'movies', 'Disney', 'movies', 'Everyone', 'else', 'should', 'move', 'better', 'Disney', 'movies']",N/A
