866458,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B0006FO9B0,A Forest Fan,"[0, 2]","The fact that a major character dies in this wrap-up miniseries should be no surprise to Farscape viewers. They killed off the lead characters every 3 episodes during the series, probably one of the reasons why the ratings never improved by the end of four seasons.I chose to put off buying this until I could watch the entire boxed set television series sequentially. This I completed just this weekend, and have now watched The Peacekeeper Wars for the first time. This is an ending that satisfies. There is a lot of nuance and drama throughout these 3 hours, and we even get a moral lesson to all the puppetry and betrayals the series was comprised of.For five years (counting the time between the series and this DVD set), Farscape has revolved around a single plot: wormholes. Specifically, the wormhole technology that IASA astronaut John Crichton had placed in his subconscious from the wormhole aliens. (That's right, Deep Space 9 fans, the ""original"" Farscape stole that idea from your show. That's okay, Crichton uses a lot of plans from science fiction he remembers, particularly Star Wars. But I digress.)Even here, as a coda to wrap up the demise of the television series, the plot is about those pesky wormholes. The resolution to that story is inventive, and in the greatest keeping with the highest science fiction tradition. If you look at Farscape on an episode-by-episode basis, a lot of it didn't mean anything. Chianna stripping, people slapped into silly flashing light torture chairs (stolen from Kirk's original Star Trek), mental adventures with Harvey, the show didn't always click. This movie's greatest triumph is that it draws everything together. The wild, madcap journey made sense, after all.Today, the Science Fiction Channel (ludicrously called Syfy) features mindless dreck like Ghost Hunters, where a bunch of morons hide in the dark while another makes a bumping noise. That might be cheaper to run, but it's a sign of just how far that network has fallen since their bungee-boss cancelled Farscape. As the Save Farscape campaign told us belatedly, the world is a poorer place without Farscape in it.Watch this movie, and see why. (Oh, and that major character death? Off-screen. Meaning they can always come back to life.

866499,AOFHGQKWCT07G,B0006FO9B0,Dean D.,"[0, 0]","Farscape was the first sci-fi series I had watched. What deviated it from others was the fact it was more mature and darker than other series I had seen or heard of during the 80s and 90s.Season 1 is a slow starter to the series, Season 2 gets it going, and both Season 3 and 4 bring the darkest and deepest elements of the story into the fray. When Sci-Fi (now SyFy) cancelled the series just as Season 4 was prepping to air due to a reduced fanbase between Season 3 and 4, the repercussions for its cancellation were severe. The fans clamored for the unfinished story to be finished. The series' creator, Rockne S O'Bannon, had planned to do 5 seasons from the start. So, what Sci-Fi did was allow the series to be concluded in a mini-series due to financial backing from various institutions as a result of fan clamor for the premature ending. A two part mini series that summarized the main plot of Season 5, with no character development or build, was the result in Farscape: Peacekeeper Wars.When those episodes released in two nights, both sequential to one another, they were regarded as the highest rated shows aired on those two days. It's been 6 years since the series concluded on TV.This DVD has the length of 4 episodes, which are over 3 hours in total length. So, do not expect a short special for what you pay.The story, although abridged, does a great job of keeping things professional, consistent, and cycling along at a brisk pace from the cliffhanger ending left at the end of Season 4 to the brilliant conclusion at the end.Anyone who is interested in the entire series would do well to note that the Farscape Complete Series does not have the Peacekeeper Wars (which is why this is packaged separately). Lions Gate Entertainment secured the rights to it when it was produced while Hallmark Entertainment held the rights to the series. So, if you buy the Complete Series, you'll need to buy this DVD as well to have the complete set.Considering the pricing on the DVD sets right now, spending not that much more from a brand new PS3 or 360 game for a complete series is worth the money for a cult classic sci-fi series.",5,A Brilliant Send-Off For A Series Ended Prematurely...,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,2141,"['Farscape', 'was', 'first', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'had', 'watched', 'What', 'deviated', 'others', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'more', 'mature', 'darker', 'other', 'series', 'had', 'seen', 'heard', '80s', '90s.Season', '1', 'slow', 'starter', 'series', 'Season', '2', 'going', 'Season', '3', '4', 'bring', 'darkest', 'deepest', 'elements', 'story', 'fray', 'When', 'Sci-Fi', 'now', 'SyFy', 'cancelled', 'series', 'just', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'prepping', 'air', 'due', 'reduced', 'fanbase', 'Season', '3', '4', 'repercussions', 'cancellation', 'were', 'severe', 'fans', 'clamored', 'unfinished', 'story', 'be', 'finished', 'series', 'creator', 'Rockne', 'S', ""O'Bannon"", 'had', 'planned', 'do', '5', 'seasons', 'start', 'So', 'what', 'Sci-Fi', 'did', 'was', 'allow', 'series', 'be', 'concluded', 'mini-series', 'due', 'financial', 'backing', 'various', 'institutions', 'result', 'fan', 'clamor', 'premature', 'ending', 'two', 'part', 'mini', 'series', 'summarized', 'main', 'plot', 'Season', '5', 'character', 'development', 'build', 'was', 'result', 'Farscape', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars.When', 'episodes', 'released', 'two', 'nights', 'sequential', 'one', 'were', 'regarded', 'highest', 'rated', 'shows', 'aired', 'two', 'days', 'been', '6', 'years', 'series', 'concluded', 'TV.This', 'DVD', 'length', '4', 'episodes', 'are', '3', 'hours', 'total', 'length', 'So', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'short', 'special', 'what', 'pay.The', 'story', 'abridged', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'things', 'professional', 'consistent', 'cycling', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'left', 'end', 'Season', '4', 'brilliant', 'conclusion', 'end.Anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'entire', 'series', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'note', 'Farscape', 'Complete', 'Series', 'not', 'have', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'why', 'packaged', 'separately', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Entertainment', 'secured', 'rights', 'when', 'was', 'produced', 'Hallmark', 'Entertainment', 'held', 'rights', 'series', 'So', 'buy', 'Complete', 'Series', ""'ll"", 'need', 'buy', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'complete', 'set.Considering', 'pricing', 'DVD', 'sets', 'right', 'now', 'spending', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'brand', 'new', 'PS3', '360', 'game', 'complete', 'series', 'money', 'cult', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'series']",N/A

Why they cancelled ""Farscape"" one season shy of its intended five-season run is beyond me, as it is such a creative and imaginative show. I suspect, though the usual culprits - money and ratings - were the culprits.As withFirefly, though, the makers of ""Farscape"" were kind enough to their legions of fans to put together a great movie to wrap up the series. ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" never made it to the theaters the way the ""Firefly"" wrap-upSerenitydid, but no matter.""Peacekeeper Wars"" is a movie/three-hour miniseries that neatly wraps up all the loose ends that were dangling after the Season Four cliffhanger ending, and does it by telling an extremely entertaining tale full of final confrontations, resolutions and battles.

Rather, I'll just say this. As absurd as the premise of the series is (and I mean ""absurd"" in the most complimentary of fashions) I ended up caring about the characters (well, except maybe for Rygel). The scriptwriters and actors put a lot of effort into making the crew of the living ship Moya into multi-dimensional beings who are actually worth caring about. That's what good television is all about, and ""Peacekeeper Wars"" is a perfect ending to a show that is a wonderful blend of entertainment and character development.",5,A Fitting End To Farscape,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,2053,"['got', 'hooked', 'friend', 'recommended', 'description', 'made', 'sound', 'bit', 'goofy', 'televised', 'sci-fi', 'comic', 'book', 'not', 'exactly', 'tastes', 'science', 'fiction', 'However', 'quickly', 'became', 'convert', 'watching', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'reviewer', 'here', 'said', 'perfectly', 'lame', 'right', 'ways', 'time', 'had', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'Netflix', 'knew', 'had', 'have', 'wonderful', 'series', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'set', 'Amazon', 'was', 'disappointed', 'though', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'made', 'Why', 'cancelled', 'Farscape', 'one', 'season', 'shy', 'intended', 'five-season', 'run', 'such', 'creative', 'imaginative', 'show', 'suspect', 'usual', 'culprits', 'money', 'ratings', 'were', 'culprits.As', 'withFirefly', 'though', 'makers', 'Farscape', 'were', 'kind', 'enough', 'legions', 'fans', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'movie', 'wrap', 'up', 'series', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'never', 'made', 'theaters', 'way', 'Firefly', 'wrap-upSerenitydid', 'matter', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'movie/three-hour', 'miniseries', 'neatly', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'were', 'dangling', 'Season', 'Four', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'telling', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'tale', 'full', 'final', 'confrontations', 'resolutions', 'battles', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Farscape', 'was', ""n't"", 'plenty', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'goofy', 'humor', 'so', 'naturally', 'plenty', 'well.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'plot', 'here', 'many', 'reviews', 'rehash', 'various', 'plot', 'elements', 'Rather', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'As', 'absurd', 'premise', 'series', 'mean', 'absurd', 'most', 'complimentary', 'fashions', 'ended', 'up', 'caring', 'characters', 'well', 'maybe', 'Rygel', 'scriptwriters', 'actors', 'put', 'lot', 'effort', 'making', 'crew', 'living', 'ship', 'Moya', 'multi-dimensional', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'worth', 'caring', 'about', 'what', 'good', 'television', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'perfect', 'ending', 'show', 'wonderful', 'blend', 'entertainment', 'character', 'development']",N/A

For any fan who watched the show, it was known soon into Season 4 that the show suddenly was canceled despite 5 seasons being contracted for.  It was a bit of a shock but you expected the show to then end as it was intended.  Instead, the show ended as season 4 was intended and left a giant cliffhanger that season 5 would of resolved!  Here in the United States at the time of the original airing Sci-Fi simply issued an apology and was forced to just move on.  After some fund raising, petitioning and of course the help of Brian Henson, Peacekeeper Wars was produced in 2004 which compressed season 5 down into a 4hr finale. (3hr run time)About Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars,  the movie picks up pretty  much right where season 4 ends and begins to long task of tying up plot lines and bringing the show to a conclusion.  The movie didn't pull any strings and you could tell they went all out with production values giving it their all so that Farscape went out with a bang; and it did!** The important thing here is that Peacekeeper Wars is not a stand alone movie.  It is highly recommended that you look into Farscape Seasons 1 - 4 first before purchasing this product.  Not only will this movie make far more sense, it also won't ruin the show for you by giving away many plot lines.-- Overall this is definitely a must see movie for any fan of Farscape.  Just like the show, this movie starts and never lets off the accelerator; giving you strong plots with great pacing and acting!++ Farscape: The Complete Series package does not include this movie (despite it saying complete series) mainly due to production rights.

866541,A1H1C2UZ6FH0YL,B0006FO9B0,Johnfourtytwo,"[0, 0]","Did anyone else notice how different The Peacekeeper Wars was to the series? Ironically I never watched the series when it originally aired except for a few episodes here and there and was totally lost because I had no idea what was going on. It felt like the Muppet Show Gone Wild.I had the same lost feeling with the other shows on at the time: SG1, Babylon 5, and Lexx because unfortunately these were arc centered shows and you had to start from the beginning to prevent getting lost.Fortunately I had strong recommendations from friends who normally don't like these type shows give it the thumbs up so with my Netflix account I started from the beginning and after the normal bumps with any new TV show, they quickly found their footing and I was hooked by all of them. I bought the entire series for each show before watching them all on Netflix because they have a policy of skipping the next video in your queue if it isn't available and that wrecks havoc with keeping an arc storyline in order.Farscape was the only series that I bought outright without watching on Netflix. Instead I started out with The Peacekeeper Wars. It was on sale for about $10.00 US so I gave it a try. It wasn't bad so later on when the finances were better I splurged for the entire collection. I couldn't believe they cancelled this show because for all intensive purposes it was hitting the mark 99% of the time.It definitely needed a fifth season because it too quickly tied up the loose ends and it was quite obvious the actors failed to get completely back into character which I noticed clearly the second time I watched it after watching the entire series nonstop; they seemed to have been very tired in this movie because their usual sparks were gone. Chiana looked different somehow like she put on some weight but a few years later in the SG-1 Season 10 episode 200 she briefly reprised her role and she looked exactly like she did in the Farscape series. I spent too much time trying to figure out the differences with her character every time she was onscreen and was very distracting throughout the whole miniseries. Claudia Black had problems also, most notibly being her accent changed. The others had changed also but it seems like they were all very tired and were ready to move on to other projects since they knew this was finally the last time they would be working on this series.Unfortunately I have no information concerning TV programming in Australia so what the Australian actors did after this is a mystery. I assume Ben Browder went back to North or South Carolina to resume his interests in NASCAR racing before he and Claudia Black were approached for their roles in SG-1.

866568,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0006FO9B0,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[328, 337]","Between 1999 and 2003, the unique sci-fi television series ""Farscape"" was aired on the Sci-Fi Channel in the U.S.  Filmed in Australia primarily by Jim Henson Productions with assistance from several Australian production companies and some funding from the Sci-Fi Channel, the series developed a strong following and was under contract for a total of five seasons.  However, various funding & political issues forced the premature cancellation of the show following the fourth season (a total of 88 episodes), much to the dismay of loyal fans who (for the most part, including myself) were greatly disappointed by the inconclusive events left in the final minutes of the final fourth-season episode.However, under the leadership of Jim Henson's (1936-1990) son, Brian Henson (Jim Henson Productions' president & CEO), Jim Henson Productions was able to secure full control over ""Farscape"", allowing it to produce a four-hour mini-series in 2004 to provide a better closure for the existing four seasons than the final events of the final fourth-season episode.  Entitled ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"", the four-hour mini-series was ostensibly equivalent to what the planned fifth season would have been, albeit much shorter, but in no way less wonderful or engaging as the original 88 episodes.  On the contrary, thanks to Brian Henson's efforts (which included directing the mini-series himself), ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" was a fantastic, engaging and powerful conclusion for one of the best sci-fi television series that has ever been produced.Seamlessly beginning where the final fourth-season episode ended, all of the cast members from the final fourth season returned in ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"".  This includes the no-nonsense Earth astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder), his fianc&eacute;e Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black), Ka D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), Chiana (Gigi Edgley), Rygel XVI (voice of Jonathan Hardy), 'Pilot' (voice of Lani John Tupu), Scorpius/Harvey (Wayne Pygram), Sikozu Shanu (Raelee Hill), Joolushko Tunai Fenta Hovalis (Tammy McIntosh), Stark (Paul Goddard), Utu-Noranti Pralatong (Melissa Jaffer), Skarin Emperor Staleek (Duncan Young), Skarin War Minister Akhna (Francesca Buller), Peacekeeper Commandant Mele-on-Grayza (Rebecca Riggs), Peacekeeper Captain Meeklo Braca (David Franklin), Ka D'Argo's son Jothee (Nathaniel Dean) and wormhole alien dubbed 'Einstein' (John Bach).With exquisite special effects, superb direction, an engaging & consistent plot and excellent acting, I rate ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and very highly recommend it to all ""Farscape"" fans.  Some of the many memorable scenes in ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" include Rygel's efforts to help restore John & Aeryn and the subsequent consequences, the various battle scenes both in space and on the ground, John's solution to war, and the birth.  Many thanks go to Brian Henson and the many wonderful actors and film crew that brought ""Farscape"" back to life.  On a side note, Ben Browder has received four Saturn Award nominations from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, of which he won one in 2002 for ""Best Actor in a Television Series"".",5,"""John Crichton is alive!""",1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,3229,"['Between', '1999', '2003', 'unique', 'sci-fi', 'television', 'series', 'Farscape', 'was', 'aired', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'U.S.', 'Filmed', 'Australia', 'primarily', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Productions', 'assistance', 'several', 'Australian', 'production', 'companies', 'funding', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'series', 'developed', 'strong', 'following', 'was', 'contract', 'total', 'five', 'seasons', 'However', 'various', 'funding', 'political', 'issues', 'forced', 'premature', 'cancellation', 'show', 'following', 'fourth', 'season', 'total', '88', 'episodes', 'much', 'dismay', 'loyal', 'fans', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'including', 'were', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'inconclusive', 'events', 'left', 'final', 'minutes', 'final', 'fourth-season', 'episode.However', 'leadership', 'Jim', 'Henson', '1936-1990', 'son', 'Brian', 'Henson', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Productions', 'president', 'CEO', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Productions', 'was', 'able', 'secure', 'full', 'control', 'Farscape', 'allowing', 'produce', 'four-hour', 'mini-series', '2004', 'provide', 'better', 'closure', 'existing', 'four', 'seasons', 'final', 'events', 'final', 'fourth-season', 'episode', 'Entitled', 'Farscape', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'four-hour', 'mini-series', 'was', 'ostensibly', 'equivalent', 'what', 'planned', 'fifth', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'albeit', 'much', 'shorter', 'way', 'less', 'wonderful', 'engaging', 'original', '88', 'episodes', 'contrary', 'thanks', 'Brian', 'Henson', 'efforts', 'included', 'directing', 'mini-series', 'Farscape', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'was', 'fantastic', 'engaging', 'powerful', 'conclusion', 'one', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'been', 'produced.Seamlessly', 'beginning', 'where', 'final', 'fourth-season', 'episode', 'ended', 'cast', 'members', 'final', 'fourth', 'season', 'returned', 'Farscape', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'no-nonsense', 'Earth', 'astronaut', 'John', 'Crichton', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Peacekeeper', 'Aeryn', 'Sun', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'Ka', ""D'Argo"", 'Anthony', 'Simcoe', 'Chiana', 'Gigi', 'Edgley', 'Rygel', 'XVI', 'voice', 'Jonathan', 'Hardy', 'voice', 'Lani', 'John', 'Tupu', 'Scorpius/Harvey', 'Wayne', 'Pygram', 'Sikozu', 'Shanu', 'Raelee', 'Hill', 'Joolushko', 'Tunai', 'Fenta', 'Hovalis', 'Tammy', 'McIntosh', 'Stark', 'Paul', 'Goddard', 'Utu-Noranti', 'Pralatong', 'Melissa', 'Jaffer', 'Skarin', 'Emperor', 'Staleek', 'Duncan', 'Young', 'Skarin', 'War', 'Minister', 'Akhna', 'Francesca', 'Buller', 'Peacekeeper', 'Commandant', 'Mele-on-Grayza', 'Rebecca', 'Riggs', 'Peacekeeper', 'Captain', 'Meeklo', 'Braca', 'David', 'Franklin', 'Ka', ""D'Argo"", 'son', 'Jothee', 'Nathaniel', 'Dean', 'wormhole', 'alien', 'dubbed', ""'Einstein"", 'John', 'Bach', '.With', 'exquisite', 'special', 'effects', 'superb', 'direction', 'engaging', 'consistent', 'plot', 'excellent', 'acting', 'rate', 'Farscape', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'resounding', '5', '5', 'stars', 'very', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Farscape', 'fans', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Farscape', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'include', 'Rygel', 'efforts', 'help', 'restore', 'John', 'Aeryn', 'subsequent', 'consequences', 'various', 'battle', 'scenes', 'space', 'ground', 'John', 'solution', 'war', 'birth', 'Many', 'thanks', 'go', 'Brian', 'Henson', 'many', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'film', 'crew', 'brought', 'Farscape', 'back', 'life', 'side', 'note', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'received', 'four', 'Saturn', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Academy', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Films', 'won', 'one', '2002', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Television', 'Series']",N/A

866592,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0006FO9B0,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 1]","Farscapeas a whole is a quirky, funny, dramatic, heartfelt, and rewarding, but somewhat obscure science-fiction show, particularly when compared to the likes ofStar TrekandStargate SG-1. However, it boasts a devoted fan-base whose efforts after the SciFi network abruptly cancelled the show after the cliffhanging conclusion to season four (despite promises to the writing staff that they would get at least one more season) ensured the creation of a miniseries to wrap up the loose ends that were left dangling and resolve the character-arcs of the main characters.The result was ""The Peacekeeper Wars"", and before we go any further, rest assured that if you aren't familiar with the preceding four seasons of Farscape, you'll have no idea whatsoever what's going on here. This is a show strictly for the fans, and the culmination of four years worth of intricate storytelling. If you're intrigued, you'll have to wend your way back to the start of season one: rest assured, you've got quite a ride ahead of you!The series begins with the remaining crew of Moya (D'Argo, Chiana, Rygel, Stark and Noranti) carefully collecting the crystallized remains of Crichton and Aeryn (and their unborn child) that were strewn at the bottom of a water planet at the end of season four. Having been resurrected by a race of people that are renowned for their peacekeeping abilities, Moya's crew decide to utilize them in the escalating conflict between the Peacekeepers and the Scarrans, two races that are bent on seizing wormhole technology to use as a weapon against the other. And where is this technology to be found? It's locked inside Crichton's brain, giving him leverage over each side whilst simultaneously painting a huge target on his back.To say more is to give away the final chapter of a story that's been steadily brewing for nearly four years and counting; the final big bang in an epic journey in which what's at stake is nothing less than the wellbeing of the known galaxy and the birth of the protagonists' longed-for baby. It's in turns epic, intimate, suspenseful, thoughtful, hilarious, tear-inducing, revelatory and inevitable, and the longer you've been on board the Farscape bandwagon, the more effecting it really is.Of course, it's hard not to watch it and wonder what might have been. ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" is essentially the entirety of what the writers had planned for the proposed series five, all condensed down into four hours. On the plus side, this means that we have a tighter, more fast-paced story, with a higher budget and absolutely no filler material. The sense of urgency is palatable, and the plot winds tighter and tighter as options begin to run out for our heroes. On the negative side, with such little time involved in the telling of the story, the characterization is a bit shortchanged. John, Aeryn and Scorpias take centre stage (though even Scorpias is nudged to the side toward the end) and although the writers are very careful to give each one of our beloved cast the chance to take their moment in the spotlight and do something truly heroic, there's simply too little time to give all of them meaningful development.As said above, if you don't already have an understanding of these characters from the television series, you'll find it difficult to find a reason to care about them. The miniseries is about closure, not growth, and what you see here is the accumulation of four seasons worth of development. D'Argo, Chiana and Rygel get plenty of great moments, as do Stark and Scorpias, but newer characters such as Grayzer, Noranti and Sikozu are relatively minor, and plenty of questions concerning them are left unanswered. It is with them that one keenly feels the lack of a fifth series, as seeds that were sown in the forth season concerning Sikozu's genetic engineering and Noranti's mysterious third eye have by necessity been cut down before their chance to reach fruition.But in other areas, the writers excel. Though Chiana's newfound psychic abilities and her consequential blindness are glossed over almost immediately, we do see the return of D'Argo's estranged son Jothee and get a poignant resolution to their relationship. Rygel goes through a rather hilarious - er, traumatic experience (he's come a long way from the greed-obsessed Dominar from the first season), and there's even a return appearance from season three regular Jool and season two guest star Grunchlk. And who else was immensely chuffed to see Braca finally come into his own after spending the entire show as someone or other's butt-monkey?In terms of continuity, there are some inexplicable bits. Why have Jothee's facial prosthetics been changed so radically? Why does Jool greet Crichton with a passionate kiss? And what on earth has Sikozu done with her hair?! But for the most part the creative team have done an exceptional job of recreating the look and atmosphere of the show whilst widening it in depth and scope.Would a fully-fledged season five have worked better than a movie-length miniseries to wrap up Farscape? Possibly, but for what it's worth, the cast and crew do a fantastic job with the opportunity they've been given, and the gratitude they hold toward the fans for making it possible is obvious. The biggest plotlines of the series, namely the tempestuous love affair between John and Aeryn, and the struggle between John's consciousness and Scorpias's neural chip are brought to satisfactory conclusions, leaving the audience with a profound image of hope, peace and further adventures to come - for the Farscape characters, if not for the viewers.",5,"""This is Your

866594,A2I2GLX3WAWIQS,B0006FO9B0,Robert Mcgoldrick,"[2, 2]","I bought this off the German Amazon site. The reviews on that site mostly did not like the quality as a Blue Ray disk. The image has a slightly pasty quality. The disk uses an MPG2 video codec instead of the typical AVC video codec. Also they used 1080i instead of 1080p video. I would guess the slightly pasty quality results from the overuse of DNA noise reduction. The image has a very smooth noise free look,again a sign of DNA noise reduction. I don't know what the source master was but I would guess an HD broadcast master because it's on the disc in two parts rather than one as on the DVD release. On the plus side the image is sharp and the color and contrast are quite good. Overall the image is a vast improvement over the SD DVD's. The website says it's a Region 2 disk but the one I received was region free. Some U.S. Blue Ray players will play the disk out of the box. But it uses a 25FPS video rate so most BR players will see it as PAL format and won't play it. I have an LG BD630 which converts PAL to NTSC and because the disc is region free played it without any problem. My Sony BR player wouldn't even recognize the disc.

866595,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0006FO9B0,Robert Moore,"[18, 21]","Warning:  Spoilers ahoy!When FARSCAPE was cancelled after Season Four and one of the great cliffhangers in TV history (John Crichton and Aeryn Sun becoming engaged to marry, but immediately afterwards being turned into a pile of crystallized pellets by a mysterious aircraft that flew over their boat), fans of the show responded with outrage.  Had there not been a renewal of the series, or a mini-series, or even a feature length film to wrap up the loose ends of the series, it would surely have gone down as the least satisfying series finale in history.  The demand was there, especially after the audience for the show actually grew after its cancellation (so much so that in a Summer of 2004 TV Guide poll of the top cult shows of all time, FARSCAPE surprisingly managed a #4 ranking, immediately behind BUFFY, THE X-FILES, and, of course, STAR TREK).  So, when it was announced that there would be a mini-series, FARSCAPE: THE PEACEKEEPER WARS, to wrap up the series, the news was greeted with ecstasy by fans of the show.So how'd they do?  Overall, pretty well.  Let me start with one of the few negatives:  this is pretty clearly a mini-series into which most of the ideas of what would have been the fifth season was stuffed.  There is through much of it a rushed feeling, as if they had to cover too much narrative in too brief of a time.  This is especially true at the beginning.  In a Season Five, the recreation and reconstitution of Aeryn and John, which took up only the first few minutes of the mini-series, would have been the subject of at least a couple of episodes.  And Aeryn's brief hesitation to marry John in the mini-series would have taken up perhaps half of Season Five.  In other words, the mini-series suffers slightly from a lack of room and the luxury of taking their time in unrolling the narrative.What THE PEACEKEEPER WARS does not suffer from is a surfeit of ideas.  After all, they are stuffing an entire season's story arc into four hours instead of twenty-two.  As a result, we get a rich, fast-moving, idea-laden epic that manages to resolve all of the major plot lines of the series, while at the same time keeping sufficient openness for feature length film or spin off television series.  I do miss the patient, slowly developing moments (remember the scene from Season Two when John is trying to talk to Aeryn after having narrowly avoided getting married to the princess, Aeryn doing dips on a bench in the background refusing to talk to him, then slowly, silently stopping her exercising, walking slowly to him and holding up the vial that contains the liquid that, when applied to the tip of the tongues, allows two people to know if they are genetically compatible, their applying it to their tongues, then kissing, then the long, long delay followed by Aeryn's turning poker faced around, and then finally a smile breaking out on her face?-this mini-series simply does not have the luxury for an exquisite moment like that).  But these guys are on borrowed time; they have a story to tell, and they tell it quickly and they tell it well.I won't go into all of the plot details.  I will recount some of the things that I most enjoyed in THE PEACEKEEPER WARS.  I loved the beginning, with a CGI Rygel swimming about the bottom of the lake where we witnessed the demise of John and Aeryn at the end of Season Four.  I had more or less forgotten that Rygel was basically a frog, and seeing the usually immobile creep swimming about so nimbly was a lot of fun.  The scene where the crew is fighting a host of enemies at the same moment that Aeryn is giving birth while continuing to blast away and getting married to John is classic FARSCAPE, taking absolutely everything way over the top.  I loved how Aeryn, the former Nazi storm trooper, had softened, and experienced instant love for an infant she would never been allowed to have had she remained a Peacekeeper.  I loved the final resolution of the Scorpius arc, and even felt a pang of regret when Harvey and John say goodbye for the final time.  I loved Chianna's new look, having gained new eyes after suffering blindness in Season Four.  I loved the fact that she and Ka D'Argo finally managed to patch things up, after she crushed him at the start of Season Three.  Would they have married?  Who knows, but there was clearly a desire on the part of the writers to heal things between them.  I loved Ka D'Argo's death, though I detested the fact that he died.  The almost jocular way he talked with John reflected how far their friendship had come from Season One, when he seemed more likely to kill John than befriend him.  And after having watched John and Aeryn engage in one of the most tortured near-romances in the history of TV for four seasons, it was marvelous to see them together, comfortable with one another, content and unconflicted at finally being a couple, exalting over their new son.  There was a great else besides that was great to enjoy, but these were only a few.Apart from the rushed aspect of the series and the fact that Ka D'Argo died, there was not a great deal that I didn't like about the series.  There was, however, one.  At the end of Season Four, Sikozu Shanu was not clearly a good or a bad character but had the potential in Season Five (had it taken place) to evolve into either.  In the mini-series she evolves into a completely reprehensible character.  Her treachery was a bit of a shock.  I also had serious problems with her physical appearance.  Raelee Hill, who plays Sikozu Shanu, is a remarkably beautiful woman (most Americans only know what she looks like in make up, but she might be in real life the most attractive of all of the FARSCAPE women).  But the hairstyle and make up they deploy on her in the mini-series was shocking.  Despite having seen Raelee Hill's name in the credits, I seriously wondered whether they had a new actress was playing Sikozu Shanu.  It was a bad, bad look for her.  Perhaps in the course of a full season Sikozu Shanu's treason would have been developed more convincingly, but here it felt implausible and unconvincing.  It was one of the few false notes in an otherwise excellent mini-series.Now for the big question:  was this up to the extremely high standards set by the series?  Yes and no.  Clearly it was well-conceived, and many of the individual moments were marvelous.  In the end, it is the difference between having 182 minutes with which to work versus over 900 minutes.  As it is, I think it is a wonderful extension of the series as a whole.  I think there is also enough evidence here to indicate that Season Five would have been very good indeed.Is there a future for FARSCAPE?  Though it labored in relative obscurity during its run on TV, more and more it considered to be one of if not the finest Sci-Fi series that TV has seen.  Star Ben Browder has stated a willing ness to work on either a film project or on a spin off series, though his involvement on STARGATE SG-1 obviously complicates things.  My gut (which admittedly has no connection with the world of reality) tells me that we have probably seen the end of the FARSCAPE saga.  Had they seriously been considering continuing the series in some fashion, I simply cannot imagine them deciding to allow the death of Ka D'Argo.  Mind you, no one would be happier to see Moya and her companions exploring new corners of the universe, but I suspect that this mini-series will be the last we see of the guys.  Nonetheless, I am profoundly grateful that they did this marvelous mini-series not just to wrap up the various story lines of the series, but to allow us to share some final adventures with some characters we had come to love very much.  FARSCAPE is one of my favorite series ever, and I'm delighted that the powers that be allowed it to end so very well.Finally, I want to praise Hallmark for bringing this mini-series out on such a remarkably affordable disc.  I honestly feel that the full season DVD sets are criminally overpriced (there truly is no hyperbole in that statement).  The outrageous price tags are absolutely not morally justifiable, and I can't conceive that they are economically justifiable, since few can afford them (if FARSCAPE is ever made available on sets that discount to around $38 a set, then this series will experience another leap in popularity).  In fact, THE PEACEKEEPER WARS might be a tad under priced.  We might have been better off if they had put it on an extra disc and added more special features and commentary.  As it is, we have a high quality reproduction of the television mini-series with little or no special features, but with a truly outstanding price.  I just wish each of the four regular seasons were comparably priced.",5,One of the truly great series gets a well-conceived wrap up,1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,8743,"['Warning', 'Spoilers', 'ahoy',

I think what was different about this show were two things: just how good Claudia Black is as an actress-with no disrespect to the other cast members-but also, their aliens seemed like REAL aliens.The end of the fourth season just left ashes and other assorted bad tastes in my mouth. When the Peacekeeper Wars came out, everything was up-tempo; the action, the interaction between the characters, the colors, the CGI, everything. It was so much better. However, as with any tragic drama, somebody had to die. Everybody I know who is familiar with the show never saw the death of D'Argo coming.

JC, astronaut, is shot through a wormhole and joins up with a crew of a ship, a living ship, as they blast through space one season at a time. Along the way they run into multiple baddies, destroy a wide array of bases, depositories, and even a few civilizations, and they also become something of a family. Sometimes that makes for humor, sometimes for seasons of sadness, and sometimes for thrilling adventure.Such is Farscape.For those who don't know about the series all that well, it is one of the few I'd tout as a complete product that can't be hyped enough. Following the exploits of John C. and the crew was a thrilling whirlwind to take part in because it evoked so many emotions and rewarded you, the viewer, for riding shotgun through the wormhole. You saw the transitions from character introduction plots and awkward travels to the becoming of crew labelled with words like ""notoriety,"" ""infamy,"" and a message filled with the hope for a better tomorrow. You even had the ""little things"" handed to you, from references to brushing teeth and how alien lifeforms could communicate, and you got it all with an Earth twist. Personally I've never pulled for ""the good guy"" before, not really one to touch base with the cliche characters in most shows, but the crew of Moya was different. They actually touched me with their plights and the ways they could always turn a bad situation into something worse and still come out alive, and I found myself addicted to it by the end of Season Two. That all seemed to come to an abrupt end when the plug was pulled on the series, though, and many people weren't happy with the cliffhanger ending. So, amidst a flurry of protest and the knowledge that Farscape sells, the Peacekeeper Wars was born.Vaguely commenting, the storyline picks right up where we left off, taking into consideration a few things I didn't think of and setting off a war that everyone watching knew was going to come. You could smell it brewing, the Scarrans threatening too many people and Scorpius standing too close to that end, and when it falls it falls beautifully. I was actually taken by all the digital love the series was shown in this miniseries, shocked in a way by the amount of currency I saw circulating in those lovely ship battles, and I loved it. Added to this is the continuation of the tale of the main characters, with even Rygel getting a little news of home and the promise of things to come. And those these comments have to be vague, I can say with certainty that the storyline flowed and wasn't forced. If you liked the series, you'll love the taste of this brew as well, with all its emotional kicks in tow.One other thing to note in all of this is that EVERYONE was back and taking part in this epic piece. I'm not talking about the crew and the main biggies, either, but I'm instead filtering through the ""little guys"" and happily noting their faces. Bracca, possibly one of my favorites, is joined by an array of people that take part in the series, again rewarding people that were perhaps wondering where they'd all gone. By and large, it is a complete set of faces to admire (and without that ""guest spot"" taste).So, in a nutshell, buy this BUT ONLY if you've kept up with the series. If not, it would be akin to reading the final chapter in a book and trying to taste the textures. To those who wanted it, though, it has come and it felt good to have more.

866626,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0006FO9B0,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[7, 8]","""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" ties up the loose ends from the series including the cliffhanger from season four. Crichton and Aeryn aren't dead after all and are restored through the hard effort of D'Argo and the rest of the crew from Moya. There's one problem; The Scarrans and the Peacekeepers are both headed to the planet where the crew have taken refuge.Scorpious still wants his Holy Grail--wormhole technology that can be used to build a massive weapon against the Scarrans. Unfortunately, the Scarrans want the same thing. Crichton has no choice but to do something he never wanted to do in the first place--build the weapon but who will he give it to?With top notch production values, a great script by Rockne O'Bannon and David Kemper, sharp direction by Brian Henson and great performances from the returning regulars, ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" manages to close ""Farscape"" on a grand scale never imagined before. Unfortunately, the four hour TV movie must compact a story arc that was original designed to occur over a much longer period of time. It doesn't detract from the drama but there's many additional dramatic options that can't be explored because of the limited time frame.I have to applaud the Sci-Fi Channel for airing the conclusion but still can't believe the idiocy of their decision to cancel one of the best most provocative series on TV. While the channel did a great job with the Dune films, they really blew it with ""Farscape"". At least fans finally got their conclusion. If not for us fans, this would never have been produced (Sci-Fi Channel certainly wouldn't have done it on their own).The first disc includes the three hour moviein its entirety. The second disc features all the extras including a 30 minute documentary about the making of ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" which discusses the cancellation and conclusion of the series nearly two years after the last episode (a cliffhanger)aired. There's also a conceptual art gallery featuring designs for the ships, alien landscapes and costumes for the grand finale. There's also a section of storyboards from key sequences in the film (including the opening, harpooning sequence among others). The Spaceship Gallery includes CGI designs of the ships at varying stages of completion as well as props from the the final three hour movie.",5,Exceptional conclusion ties up most of the loose ends,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,2315,"['Farscape', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'series', 'including', 'cliffhanger', 'season', 'four', 'Crichton', 'Aeryn', 'are', ""n't"", 'dead', 'are', 'restored', 'hard', 'effort', ""D'Argo"", 'rest', 'crew', 'Moya', 'one', 'problem', 'Scarrans', 'Peacekeepers', 'are', 'headed', 'planet', 'where', 'crew', 'have', 'taken', 'refuge.Scorpious', 'still', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'wormhole', 'technology', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'build', 'massive', 'weapon', 'Scarrans', 'Unfortunately', 'Scarrans', 'want', 'same', 'thing', 'Crichton', 'choice', 'do', 'something', 'never', 'wanted', 'do', 'first', 'place', 'build', 'weapon', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'top', 'notch', 'production', 'values', 'great', 'script', 'Rockne', ""O'Bannon"", 'David', 'Kemper', 'sharp', 'direction', 'Brian', 'Henson', 'great', 'performances', 'returning', 'regulars', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'close', 'Farscape', 'grand', 'scale', 'never', 'imagined', 'before', 'Unfortunately', 'four', 'hour', 'TV', 'movie', 'must', 'compact', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'original', 'designed', 'occur', 'much', 'longer', 'period', 'time', ""n't"", 'detract', 'drama', 'many', 'additional', 'dramatic', 'options', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'explored', 'limited', 'time', 'frame.I', 'have', 'applaud', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'airing', 'conclusion', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'idiocy', 'decision', 'cancel', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'provocative', 'series', 'TV', 'channel', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Dune', 'films', 'really', 'blew', 'Farscape', 'least', 'fans', 'finally', 'got', 'conclusion', 'not', 'fans', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'own', '.The', 'first', 'disc', 'three', 'hour', 'entirety', 'second', 'disc', 'extras', 'including', '30', 'minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'cancellation', 'conclusion', 'series', 'nearly', 'two', 'years', 'last', 'episode', 'cliffhanger', 'aired', 'also', 'conceptual', 'art', 'gallery', 'featuring', 'designs', 'ships', 'alien', 'landscapes', 'costumes', 'grand', 'finale', 'also', 'section', 'storyboards', 'key', 'sequences', 'film', 'including', 'opening', 'harpooning', 'sequence', 'others', 'Spaceship', 'Gallery', 'CGI', 'designs', 'ships', 'varying', 'stages', 'completion', 'as', 'well', 'props', 'final', 'three', 'hour', 'movie']",N/A
