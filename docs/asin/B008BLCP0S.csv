Julia Luis Dreyfus does well as an intimate and complex character.

I identified with Christine from the first scene of the first episode.  Right now, I'm looking at a character who is over-powered by her surroundings to the point that she almost disappears at times.We'll have to see...I always have my Seinfeld and Old Christine reruns, but she's a person I like to identify with on many levels.

1549721,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B008BLCP0S,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[2, 3]","Selina Meyer is the Vice-President of the United States of America, in theory one of the most powerful positions in the world. In practice, she is a spare tyre kept busy with trivial makework and assigned a staff of dysfunctional backstabbers.Veep is an American comedy series created by Armando Iannucci, a renowned British comedian and satirist. Veep can be regarded as a companion work to Iannucci's BBC series The Thick of It, which explored the dysfunctional workings of British government via a fictitious government department and the people who run it. Like The Thick of It, Veep has no laughter track and its comedy comes from the situations the characters find themselves in, either through bad luck or through their own ill-conceived actions.Veep is centred on the character of Selina Meyer, played with aplomb by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (best-known for her recurring role as Elaine on Seinfeld). Meyer is a former Presidential candidate whose failed to make the cut and feels she has been given a powerless role to prevent her being a threat to the President. It's also suggested that the President's wife (who, along with the President, is never seen) hates her, and several storylines revolve around Meyer inadvertently upstaging the President's wife through fashion or headline-grabbing 'cute' moves like getting a dog. Almost every episode features a moment where Meyer asks if the President has called, only to be told no.The bulk of the comedy comes from Meyer's staff: Gary Walsh (Tony Hale), her neurotic personal aide; Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky), a well-meaning but slightly inept fixer who ends up taking the fall for some of Meyer's misjudgements; Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh), Meyer's director of communications who, bizarrely, insists that he owns a dog when in fact he does not; Dan Egan (Reid Scott), a new, ambitious and ruthless staffmember who is not quite as smart as he thinks he is; and Sue Wilson (Sufe Bradshaw), Meyer's secretary who seems to regard politics (and almost everything) with bored contempt. Completing the regular cast is Jonah Ryan (Timothy Simons), the liaison with the White House, a fantastically creepy and self-obsessed man specialising in inappropriate behaviour and inventing useless new acronyms (FDOTUS for the President's potential new dog). What makes the show work is that not all of these people are shown to be completely useless (otherwise they wouldn't be in their jobs), but that they prove unable to adapt to rapidly-developing situations. In particular, the older staff-members have no idea on how to deal with blogs and Twitter and spend vast amounts of time obsessed with style and spin rather than the substance of their policies.Performances are uniformly excellent, with Louis-Dreyfus bringing her A-game and convincing as a politician of ambition and substance whose career has taken an abrupt left-turn into near irrelevance, resulting in frustration and annoyance. This is brilliantly show in a sequence where the President falls ill, so Meyer is called into the White House's emergency situation room, where she is almost overcome by the plush furniture, flashing lights and people treating her like she's the most important person on Earth. When the President recovers, Meyer is dumped back to her previous task, eating yogurt at a dessert store in a futile effort to show how down with the people she is. The gap between the two positions has never quite been nailed so ruthlessly as this. Special mention must also be made to Timothy Simons, who makes his character despicably punchable whenever he appears but you also want to hear what fantastically inappropriate thing he's going to say next. He's the Joffrey Baratheon of the West Wing, though fortunately without the power to execute anyone.The season has a nicely-developed storyline about Meyer desperately trying to get some policies - any policies - through government to show she's not completely useless. An innocuous tweet about cutlery in the first episode snowballs out of control, taking with it several government bills and congressional hearings, whilst an apparent crisis in Meyer's personal life threatens to upset her career until she dumps it on one of her aides. The story, characters and dialogue are all sharp and very funny.Compared to the genius of The Thick of It, Veep more than holds it own. Veep isn't quite as knives-out nasty as The Thick of It at its most vicious, mainly due to the lack of a character comparable to Malcolm Tucker (although foul-mouthed Congressman Roger Furlong, who appears late in the season, shows hints that he might go that way). But Iannucci's decision to make the new show stand on its own feet without resorting to his old stand-bys is both a brave one and one that works. There are a few episodes that don't quite gel together and it's arguable if some of the staffmembers would get away with what they do without being fired on the instant, but overall this is a very strong opening season.",4,"An extremely strong opening season: funny, satirical and sharp",1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,4983,"['Selina', 'Meyer', 'Vice-President', 'United', 'States', 'America',

1549722,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B008BLCP0S,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[1, 2]","""Veep: The Complete First Season""(HBO, 2013)This show was both a downer and an uninvolving bore. Like ""Boss,"" this seeks to whet what the producers believe is a bottomless public desire to see politicians and politics not simply mocked, but thoroughly demolished and disrespected. On both shows, every single character is greedy and unappealing, purely venal and self-serving, which is a result -- of course!! -- of their being in politics. ""Politics = Bad"" is the main -- and apparently only -- message on both shows, it rings hollow and false.  That's even more true on ""Veep,"" because the characters are not only unlikeable, they are also universally incompetent, a bunch of easily-mocked boobs who screw up everything they lay their hands on, including the Vice President as portrayed by Julia Louis Dreyfuss.Really?  Do we really think that any of these people could have gotten this far in politics by being complete idiots? This kind of blunt, aggressive caricature may be comforting to those of us -- and there are far too many these days -- who see politicians as the lowest of the low, a subspecies incapable of solving even the simplest problem. But it's not very realistic, even in the confines of a comedic farce, and perhaps more importantly it fails as drama, since the entire series is reduced to a one-note joke. I also disliked the overuse of profanity, not because I'm some kind of f***ing prude, but because it diminishes the story and makes the writers seem lazy, rather than clever or shocking. Do we really think that the VP would walk around press conferences and fundraisers swearing at everyone around her?  Apparently there are still a few people who think this kind of language still has some kind of shock value when seen on TV, or that it would be cathartic to see those wicked politicians portrayed as if they were 1950's longshoremen. It's not. It's repetitive and dull, and if they wanted it to be funny, they should have used it more strategically and sparingly. The writing on the show is generally very clumsy: there were some clever turns in the interpersonal relations of the various characters, but the attempts to impose an over-arching plot onto each episode were leaden and forced.I also strongly dislike the shrill portrayal of human beings as universally stupid and self-serving, and felt the same way about other bleak, nihilistic offerings such as Don Cheadle's ""House Of Lies."" This brand of turbocharged cynicism may reflect some of what's in the popular culture today, but not everyone in America is a Tea Party member or shares their view of politicians as an evil, subhuman species worthy of tarring and feathering, if not worse.  I think most people go into politics with good intentions but find the system so debased and dominated by the uncontrolled influence of money and lobbyists that it becomes nearly impossible to make progress for the greater good. But the portrayal of out most powerful politicians as sitcom buffoons doesn't really help -- it doesn't even feel that much fun. I found this show to be too dull to watch, a ham-fisted mix of ""Seinfeld,"" ""West Wing"" and ""Gomer Pyle."" I'll stick to shows with a little more nuance and relevance, thank you.

In the USA the most successful comedy shows featuring unlikable characters were SEINFELD and CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, by the co-creator of SEINFELD, Larry David.

If you compare the Veep to Malcolm in the UK show though, there is no comparison.

1549742,AYG1U47VFZ165,B008BLCP0S,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[13, 43]","I'll leave the lavish praise to others with their own intellectual bent, and I'll simply come at HBO's VEEP from an honest, bipartisan angle: what's so disappointing (if not confounding) about VEEP is that - so far as the humor is concerned - we've seen so much of this before.  The rapid-fire delivery.  The high-placed doofus in charge of other high-placed doofuses (or is that `doofi'?).  The biting insider perspective on gutter politics.  And histrionics punctuated by vulgarity, from the F-word to the A-word to the S-word and no doubt all the others.  And it's been done so much better elsewhere.I found myself wondering: how can you stuff so many performers, arguably at the top of the comic game, into such horribly retread material?  Julia Louis Dreyfus made a career out of playing ""Elaine Benes"" to TV's Jerry Seinfeld; there, in the company of other like-minded simpletons, the schtick worked.  Here?  So much of what the writers try to do is elevate the mundane by lacing it with profanity.  Still, she attacks her dialogue admirably, and that deserves praise, however modest.  Tony Hale made ""Buster"" a household name with ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, and his Vice-Presidential aide Gary Walsh isn't a far cry from that role; much of Buster's lovable cluelessness is gone - a necessity of the environment - and I found myself rooting that Hale gets more screen time when VEEP returns for its next season.  I've been watching Matt Walsh since DOG BITES MAN; here, he plays high-placed Veep staffer Mike McLinktock with much of the same cadence to his speech that he's adopted everywhere, and it works to great acclaim.  Walsh's problem is that he doesn't ""look"" the show-leading-man type, but that never stopped Louie CK, so here's hoping some inspired production company snatches Walsh up and gives him his own program some day.  Anna Chlumsky - as assistant Amy Brookheimer - just feels so horribly miscast in the ensemble; perhaps if she'd cut her teeth on greater comic fare, then she wouldn't deliver big lines with so little aplomb.  She's an anchor weighing the group down, but again, some of that may be the fault of the uninspired material and not her skills as a Thespian.Of course, it'll be a hit with HBO's largely left-leaning audience, but that doesn't mean folks on the Right should avoid VEEP.  It's seriously worth a view if for no other reason than to marvel at how quickly so many actors and actresses can deliver their lines at lightning-fast speeds.  The problem is, at that rate, the jokes go by too fast - there's no time to stop and enjoy the moments of mirth.  Here's a tip: when everyone speaks at sixty miles an hour, there's bound to be a pile-up.  When that happens, you slow down, stop, and marvel at the wreckage.  VEEP presents plenty of wreckage, but it's seriously void of any moments of reflection UNLESS that reflection comes at the expense of the other characters.  Even in satire, you don't always need to be insulting people, places, and events; some of the humor just comes from natural human expressions.Comedy shouldn't require Cliff Notes, and VEEP could use some good old-school antics instead of trying to force feed its audience what he thinks are highbrow laughs laced with an expletive.  Eddie Murphy made a career on uttering one expletive after another; Julia Louis-Dreyfus didn't, so maybe ease up.  When you leave the launch pad believing you've artistically constructed ""a comedy for the ages"" but you haven't ironed out all of the particulars, you end up with set pieces which - by no one's intent - can be painfully unfunny, which is how I found much of the first season.  Not everyone in AudienceLand believes the Vice-President of the United States is and should be reduced to a political joke.  I know that's what much of the mainstream media would have you believe, but, sometimes, such banality really IS thin.Mildly RECOMMENDED.  As I've stated above, VEEP deserves a second season if for no other reason than I'll hold out hope that the writers actually develop some genuinely funny material.  With this much comic presence on the screen, one can only hope that they'll start ""earning"" their laughs instead of ""telegraphing"" political irony.",3,A Vulgar Elaine Benes Goes To Washington,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,4210,"[""'ll"", 'leave', 'lavish', 'praise', 'others', 'own', 'intellectual', 'bent', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'come', 'HBO', 'VEEP', 'honest', 'bipartisan', 'angle', 'what', 'so', 'disappointing', 'not', 'confounding', 'VEEP', 'so', 'far', 'humor', 'concerned', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'before', 'rapid-fire', 'delivery', 'high-placed', 'doofus', 'charge', 'other', 'high-placed', 'doofuses', 'doofi', 'biting', 'insider', 'perspective', 'gutter', 'politics', 'histrionics', 'punctuated', 'vulgarity', 'F-word', 'A-word', 'S-word', 'doubt', 'others', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'elsewhere.I', 'found', 'wondering', 'how', 'can', 'stuff', 'so', 'many', 'performers', 'arguably', 'top', 'comic', 'game', 'such', 'horribly', 'retread', 'material', 'Julia', 'Louis', 'Dreyfus', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'Elaine', 'Benes', 'TV', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'there', 'company', 'other', 'like-minded', 'simpletons', 'schtick', 'worked', 'Here', 'So', 'much', 'what', 'writers', 'try', 'do', 'elevate', 'mundane', 'lacing', 'profanity', 'Still', 'dialogue', 'admirably', 'praise', 'however', 'modest', 'Tony', 'Hale', 'made', 'Buster', 'household', 'name', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'Vice-Presidential', 'aide', 'Gary', 'Walsh', ""n't"", 'far', 'cry', 'role', 'much', 'Buster', 'lovable', 'cluelessness', 'gone', 'necessity', 'environment', 'found', 'rooting', 'Hale', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'when', 'VEEP', 'next', 'season', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Matt', 'Walsh', 'DOG', 'BITES', 'MAN', 'here', 'high-placed', 'Veep', 'staffer', 'Mike', 'McLinktock', 'much', 'same', 'cadence', 'speech', 'adopted', 'everywhere', 'great', 'acclaim', 'Walsh', 'problem', ""n't"", 'look', 'show-leading-man', 'type', 'never', 'stopped', 'Louie', 'CK', 'so', 'here', 'hoping', 'inspired', 'production', 'company', 'Walsh', 'up', 'own', 'program', 'day', 'Anna', 'Chlumsky', 'assistant', 'Amy', 'Brookheimer', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'ensemble', 'perhaps', ""'d"", 'cut', 'teeth', 'greater', 'comic', 'fare', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'big', 'lines', 'so', 'little', 'aplomb', 'anchor', 'weighing', 'group', 'down', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'fault', 'uninspired', 'material', 'not', 'skills', 'Thespian.Of', 'course', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hit', 'HBO', 'largely', 'left-leaning', 'audience', ""n't"", 'mean', 'folks', 'Right', 'should', 'avoid', 'VEEP', 'seriously', 'worth', 'view', 'other', 'reason', 'marvel', 'how', 'quickly', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'actresses', 'can', 'deliver', 'lines', 'lightning-fast', 'speeds', 'problem', 'rate', 'jokes', 'go', 'too', 'fast', 'time', 'stop', 'enjoy', 'moments', 'mirth', 'Here', 'tip', 'when', 'everyone', 'sixty', 'miles', 'hour', 'bound', 'be', 'pile-up', 'When', 'slow', 'down', 'stop', 'marvel', 'wreckage', 'VEEP', 'plenty', 'wreckage', 'seriously', 'void', 'moments', 'reflection', 'reflection', 'expense', 'other', 'characters', 'Even', 'satire', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'need', 'be', 'insulting', 'people', 'places', 'events', 'humor', 'just', 'natural', 'human', 'expressions.Comedy', 'should', ""n't"", 'require', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'VEEP', 'could', 'use', 'good', 'old-school', 'antics', 'instead', 'trying', 'force', 'feed', 'audience', 'what', 'are', 'highbrow', 'laughs', 'laced', 'expletive', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'made', 'career', 'uttering', 'one', 'expletive', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'maybe', 'ease', 'up', 'When', 'leave', 'launch', 'pad', 'believing', ""'ve"", 'artistically', 'constructed', 'comedy', 'ages', 'have', ""n't"", 'ironed', 'out', 'particulars', 'end', 'up', 'set', 'pieces', 'one', 'intent', 'can', 'be', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'how', 'found', 'much', 'first', 'season', 'Not', 'everyone', 'AudienceLand', 'Vice-President', 'United', 'States', 'should', 'be', 'reduced', 'political', 'joke', 'know', 'what', 'much', 'mainstream', 'media', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'sometimes', 'such', 'banality', 'really', 'IS', 'thin.Mildly', 'RECOMMENDED', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'VEEP', 'second', 'season', 'other', 'reason', ""'ll"", 'hold', 'out', 'hope', 'writers', 'actually', 'develop', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'material', 'much', 'comic', 'presence', 'screen', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'start', 'earning', 'laughs', 'instead', 'telegraphing', 'political', 'irony']",N/A

The problem is the writing. Each episode crams two or three political (or occasionally personal) catastrophes into the less-than-30-minute slot, so there's practically non-stop angst and frenzy as they try to put out the fires. It gets tiring fast.The catastrophes blow by so quickly that they are practically indistinguishable from one another, and every one gets resolved in some random way that never makes any more sense than the problem did. It's like slapstick without pratfalls and pies in the face. It's just frantic, meaningless running around, packed with non-stop texting and snide put-downs flying in every direction, but it's never funny at all.Whatever entertainment value Veep has lies only in seeing gifted actors working well together at the speed of lightning; but the awful material they have to work with, and the frantic pace required to fit all that awful material into a half-hour show, make it hard - maybe impossible - to stay with for more than a few seemingly identical episodes.I guess what I'm saying is that Veep (unlike Seinfeld) is just another frantic, mindless, infinitely repeating formulaic sitcom in the I Love Lucy line, but with snarky wisecracks instead of pies. It's disappointing that that tired formula still thrives in this century.I'm surprised Veep was renewed for a second season, but I guess I shouldn't be.

1549754,A1SDBUUTK52F32,B008BLCP0S,Joseph M. Welnack,"[6, 11]","This is a show with a very good cast and some really weak writers; a lot of the jokes border on some old material from the Larry David show ""reworked"" for a ""political"" show.  A real shame because this show does have it's moments where it is funny.  IMHO too many ""tall"" jokes regarding ""Jonah"" but the character ""Dan Egan"" seems to have some nicely writen material playing a Machevelian staffer.My main critical comment regards a lot of HBO content; too much profanity!  Now, I am retired from the military so ""frank language"" is still a bad habit I am trying to break.  In show business however HBO makes a critical mistake with hit shows not looking four or five seasons down the road.  Example, the ""Soprano's"" and ""Deadwood"" were just great shows and people who didn't care for the language could vote with the remote.  However, the ""Boston"" version of the Soprano's is a little silly with all the ""freaking"" and other sorry measures made to clean it up enough for cable.  As to Deadwood, if a ""Boston"" version was ever cut for syndication the show would go from an hour to maybe a three minute show the profanity was so bad.  For those of you who are younger, the ""Boston"" version was a term that came from burlesque meaning that while in Boston you had to clean up the act to prevent a raid.Returning to HBO, they would do well to bring in some writers who don't have to go for the crouch to get laughs.  This could be a very funny show.  They need to clean up the language.  I am a big fan of the A&E; franchise ""Breaking Bad""; this is a show about drug traficing, killing and manufacturing meth and with the brilliant writers Vince Gilligan, Executive Producer brings to the script they won't have to produce a ""Boston"" version.  With the dark subject matter coupled with the gallows humor this show exhibits they won't have to clean it up for cable.

1549755,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008BLCP0S,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[22, 25]","""Veep"" creator Armando Iannucci brings his unorthodox brand of workplace comedy and political satire to American government with HBO's ribald showcase for Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  If you are familiar with Iannucci's impeccable British series ""The Thick of It,"" (which was also the basis for the feature film ""In The Loop"" which netted Iannucci a Screenplay Oscar nomination) in many ways--this is just a twist on that successful formula.  Both sitcoms (at times) play as fairly conventional workplace comedies driven by awkward moments and uncomfortable blunders. The casts struggle valiantly to keep their heads above water, maintain a dignity in the most unprofessional situations, and deal with the incompetency of those around them. Here's the thing that separates the shows, though. These workplaces just happens to be in the top offices of the Government.  In England, ""The Thick of It"" is set in the fictional Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship with direct ties to the Prime Minister's office while, in America, ""Veep"" is set in the offices of the actual Vice President.  And almost the entire basis for both shows is how the staff can spin any occurrence, no matter how tragic or absurd, with the media, the public, and the country's real power brokers.Louis-Dreyfus plays Vice President Selina Meyer to perfection.  As she tries to carve out a niche for herself within the administration, her continuous exclusion (the president is never in direct contact with her) causes her to seek attention in other ways.  She is both insulated by her faithful staff and compromised by their antics.  The politics of ""Veep"" is not about getting things accomplished but rather by remaining as unobjectionable as possible.  Every decision, no matter how slight, tends to lead to catastrophe and the crew scramble to create the most positive spin on any given disaster.  Sounds too familiar!  ""Veep"" can be smart, incisive and utterly convincing at highlighting the fact that ANYTHING can turn into a media circus.  And Louis-Dreyfus, both physically and emotionally, throws herself into this complex portrayal.  She can be thoroughly unlikable, but still has the power to elicit your sympathy.  Plus, she's wildly funny and gives one of the year's most committed performances.This isn't just a Louis-Dreyfus vehicle, though.  The show boasts an ensemble cast with a number of terrific supporting roles.  Anna Chlumsky (grown up from ""My Girl"" days) tries to be the voice of reason, Arrested Development's Tony Hale can literally do no wrong, Reid Scott is convincingly cut-throat, and Matt Walsh plays everyone's fall guy to perfection.  What strikes me as odd is that no one is particularly likable individually and yet you do like them as a group!  Season One consists of eight half hour episodes that, I believe, get progressively funnier.  As you get to know the team and as the blunders intensify, the humor gets increasingly brutal and uncomfortable.  It's a solid beginning with much room for growth.  I look forward to catching up with things in Season Two.

As I watched the entire first season I think I honestly laughed perhaps once and that was just a small chuckle, not a belly laugh. Having just seen THIS IS THE END and actually finding myself laughing out loud about 15 times in the middle of a theater, this show never inspired that once while sitting in the comfort of my living room. It really is unfunny and displays in so many ways how out of touch Hollywood is with the real world.Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, an actress who has shown time and time again that she knows how to be funny, stars as the title character, Senator Selina Meyer who has just taken on the role of Vice President. But what she thought would be a position that would provide her with some power and a direct link to the White House ends up being nothing of the sort. Selina is given little more to do than the bidding of the President, helping him to shore up votes he needs for projects while never getting credit or the chance to forward her own ideas.Through it all she plays the political games where back stabbing is a virtue and keeping a smile plastered on your face while twisting the knife is the norm. This same theme is used quite well with Netflix series HOUSE OF CARDS but here it falls flat.Meyers has surrounded herself with complete idiots or career builders who are more inclined to take care of themselves than her. Some have the potential to be funny characters but are never given the chance to show it. Instead they seem to think that the more they drop the F bomb the funnier they are. This made me worry about how much input Louis-Dreyfuss had in the scripts as I thought back to the time period when Saturday Night Live became a show that was unfunny...and when she was a cast member. At that time they seemed to tell jokes that they thought were funny but that no one laughed at. I found this series to be much like that.I had heard this series was funny. I even remember several people involved being nominated for Emmys. After watching it I found my feelings about the Emmys and other awards given in Hollywood to be vindicated. Rather than honor anyone for true talent and ability it seems as though they give out awards for simply being someone they like or for trying to portray anyone they dislike in an unfavorable way. Anyone connected with this show who would win didn't deserve it and should immediately give the award back.I was stunned to see that a second season of this series has already aired and that a third is on the way. It makes me wonder what shows that delivered pilots to HBO were turned down. Surely there was something else that deserved the funding that this show gets. The only thing this show made me want to do was turn back to television to see if a rerun of SEINFELD was on. Now that show was funny and so was Louis-Dreyfuss when she was in it. Unless the only thing you find humorous is how often and how creatively a person can swear it you won't enjoy this show.",2,PROOF THAT STAR NAMES DON'T MEAN STAR QUALITY,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,3073,"['Let', 'just', 'dive', 'right', 'start', 'shall', 'VEEP', 'one', 'most', 'unfunny', 'shows', 'ever', 'created', 'Yes', 'really', 'bad', 'watched', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'think', 'honestly', 'laughed', 'perhaps', 'once', 'was', 'just', 'small', 'chuckle', 'not', 'belly', 'laugh', 'Having', 'just', 'seen', 'THIS', 'THE', 'END', 'actually', 'finding', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', '15', 'times', 'middle', 'theater', 'show', 'never', 'inspired', 'once', 'sitting', 'comfort', 'living', 'room', 'really', 'unfunny', 'displays', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'how', 'touch', 'Hollywood', 'real', 'world.Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfuss', 'actress', 'who', 'shown', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'how', 'be', 'funny', 'stars', 'title', 'character', 'Senator', 'Selina', 'Meyer', 'who', 'just', 'taken', 'role', 'Vice', 'President', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'position', 'would', 'provide', 'power', 'direct', 'link', 'White', 'House', 'up', 'being', 'nothing', 'sort', 'Selina', 'given', 'little', 'more', 'do', 'bidding', 'President', 'helping', 'shore', 'up', 'votes', 'projects', 'never', 'getting', 'credit', 'chance', 'forward', 'own', 'ideas.Through', 'political', 'games', 'where', 'back', 'stabbing', 'virtue', 'keeping', 'smile', 'plastered', 'face', 'twisting', 'knife', 'norm', 'same', 'theme', 'used', 'quite', 'well', 'Netflix', 'series', 'HOUSE', 'CARDS', 'here', 'flat.Meyers', 'surrounded', 'complete', 'idiots', 'career', 'builders', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'inclined', 'take', 'care', 'have', 'potential', 'be', 'funny', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'show', 'Instead', 'seem', 'think', 'more', 'drop', 'F', 'bomb', 'funnier', 'are', 'made', 'worry', 'how', 'much', 'input', 'Louis-Dreyfuss', 'had', 'scripts', 'thought', 'back', 'time', 'period', 'when', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'became', 'show', 'was', 'unfunny', 'when', 'was', 'cast', 'member', 'time', 'seemed', 'tell', 'jokes', 'thought', 'were', 'funny', 'one', 'laughed', 'found', 'series', 'be', 'much', 'that.I', 'had', 'heard', 'series', 'was', 'funny', 'even', 'remember', 'several', 'people', 'involved', 'being', 'nominated', 'Emmys', 'watching', 'found', 'feelings', 'Emmys', 'other', 'awards', 'given', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'vindicated', 'Rather', 'honor', 'anyone', 'true', 'talent', 'ability', 'give', 'out', 'awards', 'simply', 'being', 'someone', 'like', 'trying', 'portray', 'anyone', 'dislike', 'unfavorable', 'way', 'Anyone', 'connected', 'show', 'who', 'would', 'win', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'should', 'immediately', 'give', 'award', 'back.I', 'was', 'stunned', 'see', 'second', 'season', 'series', 'already', 'aired', 'third', 'way', 'wonder', 'what', 'delivered', 'pilots', 'HBO', 'were', 'turned', 'down', 'Surely', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'deserved', 'funding', 'show', 'only', 'thing', 'show', 'made', 'want', 'do', 'was', 'turn', 'back', 'television', 'see', 'rerun', 'SEINFELD', 'was', 'Now', 'show', 'was', 'funny', 'so', 'was', 'Louis-Dreyfuss', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'find', 'humorous', 'how', 'often', 'how', 'creatively', 'person', 'can', 'swear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'show']",N/A

The characters are about as likable as most people find their actual elected officials to be, which is not at all.Also, in a Seinfeld-ian way, there's nobody to root for, either, as none of the characters demonstrate any non-selfish motives.  However, neither are the VPOTUS and her staff malevolent, so it's easy to root for them to 'do no harm' in the best way possible.The writing and acting are impeccable, and if you like this you may want to also try 'In the Loop', a film by the same director.  That film focuses on a mid-level UK politician who finds himself thrust upwards into global political issues without the proper preparation, capabilities, or staff.  If you're American you may want to turn up the subtitles to catch the elegant tapestry of cursing woven by key characters in the film.Similarly, the language in Veep could also be considered harsh by those offended by vulgarity.  I wouldn't call it gratuitous, because I think it's fairly close to accurate, and if you can endure (or, like me, enjoy) the near-poetic use of vulgarity in context, then you may find yourself enjoying Veep.",5,"Great show, extraordinarily fast-paced, harsh (but realistic) language, and non-glorification of the political process",1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,1381,"['34', 'Did', 'President', 'call', '34', '34', 'No', ""ma'am"", '34', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'out-of-the-loop', 'VPOTUS', 'who', 'trying', 'seem', 'relevant', 'connected', 'who', 'not-inept', 'also', 'not-ept', 'staff', 'keep', 'head', 'water', 'shark-infested', 'waters', 'DC', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'likable', 'most', 'people', 'find', 'actual', 'elected', 'officials', 'be', 'not', 'all.Also', 'Seinfeld-ian', 'way', 'nobody', 'root', 'either', 'none', 'characters', 'demonstrate', 'non-selfish', 'motives', 'However', 'are', 'VPOTUS', 'staff', 'malevolent', 'easy', 'root', ""'do"", 'harm', 'best', 'way', 'possible.The', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'impeccable', 'like', 'may', 'want', 'also', 'try', 'Loop', 'film', 'same', 'director', 'film', 'mid-level', 'UK', 'politician', 'who', 'thrust', 'upwards', 'global', 'political', 'issues', 'proper', 'preparation', 'capabilities', 'staff', ""'re"", 'American', 'may', 'want', 'turn', 'up', 'subtitles', 'catch', 'elegant', 'tapestry', 'cursing', 'woven', 'key', 'characters', 'film.Similarly', 'language', 'Veep', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'considered', 'harsh', 'offended', 'vulgarity', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'gratuitous', 'think', 'fairly', 'close', 'accurate', 'can', 'endure', 'enjoy', 'near-poetic', 'use', 'vulgarity', 'context', 'then', 'may', 'find', 'enjoying', 'Veep']",N/A

The show is funny, witty, well acted, and at the end of each short 30-minute episode I'm left wishing the show was an hour. The good news: Veep has been picked up for a second season according to a 4/30/2012 Hollywood Reporter article.LikeThe Office, the show is shot in that improv, hand-held camera, 'you are there' style of filming, which for me can get a little annoying (especially since filming in that style has been an epidemic of late), but that is the show's only negative in my opinion.The show follows VP Selina Meyer and her bumbling staff as they try to navigate through the brutal behind the scenes world of Washington DC politics. And for the most part poor Selina and her staff find themselves in wayyyy over their heads in almost every situation. The result is the hilariousness that ensues as we watch Selina get herself into one embarrassing and humiliating situation after another, then try to get out of those situations without self destructing.And don't get me wrong about the ""bumbling staff"" comment...I mean no disrespect to the supporting cast.  The chemistry between Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the cast of 6 primary supporting actors (Anna Chlumsky, Tony Hale, Reid Scott, Timothy Simons, Matt Walsh & Sufe Bradshaw) is the key ingredient to Veep's excellence.4  stars for Veep.
