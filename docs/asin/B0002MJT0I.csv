840866,A1G0IHVBEN8ZTB,B0002MJT0I,Abdulla M. Al Qasim,"[1, 1]","I first saw this movie on my honeymoon in a resort... yeah not exactly the most romantic movie to see whilst on your honeymoon, I know. This is the movie that got me switched on to the whole Simon Pegg and Nick Frost combo (having never seen the so much talked about Spaced). I have to admit that I bought the DVD because I was feeling a bit nostalgic.This movie is a comedy / horror movie (weird combo) but trust me it does work... I find the comedy style in most Simon Pegg movies to be refreshing and somewhat subtle when compared to the in your face slapstick Hollywood comedic styles. Come to think of it there is a bit carried over from this movie to the movieHot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition).. the morning sequence (where Shaun gets up in the morning and goes through his daily rituals in fast sequence of shots) and Ed's `Yeah Boooyyyyyyy!' Not that it takes anything away from either of the two movies. I tend to find Hot Fuzz funnier than this one, but this is still a funny movie.I have to agree with the other reviews when they say that there scenes with quite a bit of realistic gore in them that might make people cringe. Also, there is slight amount of profanity in the movie... but it shouldn't be too much of a problem as the kids will not be around to watch this one for sure!All in all a funny movie with a change from American style comedies and it kind of has compromise ending in the end where it isn't the happiest ending in the world, but at least everyone is sort of happy where they are!",4,I'll Stop Doing it When You Stop Laughing!,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1510,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'honeymoon', 'resort', 'yeah', 'not', 'exactly', 'most', 'romantic', 'movie', 'see', 'whilst', 'honeymoon', 'know', 'movie', 'got', 'switched', 'whole', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'combo', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'talked', 'Spaced', 'have', 'admit', 'bought', 'DVD', 'was', 'feeling', 'bit', 'nostalgic.This', 'movie', 'comedy', '/', 'horror', 'movie', 'weird', 'combo', 'work', 'find', 'comedy', 'style', 'most', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'movies', 'be', 'refreshing', 'somewhat', 'subtle', 'when', 'compared', 'face', 'slapstick', 'Hollywood', 'comedic', 'styles', 'Come', 'think', 'bit', 'carried', 'movie', 'movieHot', 'Fuzz', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'morning', 'sequence', 'where', 'Shaun', 'up', 'morning', 'daily', 'rituals', 'fast', 'sequence', 'shots', 'Ed', 'Yeah', 'Boooyyyyyyy', 'Not', 'anything', 'away', 'two', 'movies', 'tend', 'find', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'funnier', 'one', 'still', 'funny', 'movie.I', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'when', 'say', 'scenes', 'quite', 'bit', 'realistic', 'gore', 'might', 'make', 'people', 'cringe', 'Also', 'slight', 'amount', 'profanity', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'much', 'problem', 'kids', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'watch', 'one', 'sure', 'funny', 'movie', 'change', 'American', 'style', 'comedies', 'kind', 'compromise', 'ending', 'end', 'where', ""n't"", 'happiest', 'ending', 'world', 'least', 'everyone', 'sort', 'happy', 'where', 'are']",Shaun of the Dead

840868,A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G,B0002MJT0I,"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF""","[3, 4]","Shaun of the Dead does everything a zombie movie needs to do, and it also manages to be an intelligent comedy that says something not only about the protagonist Shaun (Simon Pegg), but about the Britain around him as well.  He is, we have the impression, an observant, smart, young-ish man if given the opportunity.  You might actually say he's got what it takes to be a leader of other men and women, except there are a few things working against him:The first is his daily routine, which is fit for a zombie.  Every morning he arises, has coffee, toast with jam, dresses for work, heads around the corner to the local Quick-E-Mart, then off to work where his co-workers are practically half his age.  Not exactly inspiring; but throught it all we have the sense that were he spurred by something, he might transcend his situation and become what he was meant to be.The second thing holding him back is his friend Ed (Nick Frost), who has never left the pub in his mind.  He's fat, obnoxious, vulgar, probably smelly, and particularily charming in those qualities around Shaun's girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).  Ed keep Shaun firmly ensconsed in the local pub, ""The Winchester,"" and is his compatriot in underachievment.  Such is the extent of Ed's underachieving ways that when he picks up the apartment, we're not even sure he's done it since the place becomes messy before Shaun gets home.  He does have redeeming qualities; at least he's not Pete, the responsible one, whom Shaun would be were it not for the world around him.Suddenly; in the midst of routine, drinking at the Winchester, dealing with his stepdad Phil (Bill Nighy), and trying to patch things up with Liz, zombies begin to walk the earth.  The explanation (and it's very brief) is that it's a sickness infecting the locals.  Of course this is a commentary on everyday Britains and their routine; emblematic in Shaun.  He is basically the original zombie before people start eating brains.  He has no variety in his life, no hopes of breaking out of that humdrum because he lacks the ambition within him.  Basically, zombies are humans whose life have betrayed their minds; the only difference with Shaun is that he doesn't moan, lumber around and try to eat people.Oddly enough, the emergence of zombies gives him exactly what he needs to at least touch on his potential.  His stepfather succumbs to the zombies, only after an actually very heartfelt speech that is probably one of three sincere moments that evoke both pity and fear.  His problems with Liz evaporate in the face of the greater good, and she actually starts defending his decisions to the obnoxious David who's only there to second-guess Shaun.  It's okay though; he dies badly.The film has some truly hilarious scenes, espcially when they decide which LPs to throw at the zombies to try and decapitate them.  The Batman soundtrack doesn't survive this round.  Of course who would have thought a cricket bat would work so well?  It's a solid zombie-crushing implement; a piece of life in the zombie world.The extras are great to watch, espcially the Zomb-o-meter, which acts like VH-1's old ""Pop Up Videos"" where trivia and info pops up on screen as you watch the film.This is definitely a film for any zombie freak; it does something that a lot of good zombie movies don't make you do, which is laugh deliberately.",5,"Who would have thought?

840870,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002MJT0I,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[80, 95]","It is a very hard line to cross in today's cinema to make a film that part comedy and horror film. Normally, when this happens we end up with something like the Chucky series. It began serious, but after seeing the new preview, I know they have given up serious horror and invaded into the world of campy horror. I was afraid at first that this film was going to go into that direction, but then I remembered ... this film wasn't made in America, it was made in Britain where the humor is actually intellectually funny. As I was sitting and enjoying this film from beginning to end, I couldn't help but wonder why America has not been able to master this style of film yet. Why is our comedies still heavily based in the sex humor or bathroom jokes? While there were some in this film, I felt the majority of the humor was logic and intelligence based. ""If you listen to the words, you will laugh at the jokes"" style of comedy instead of waiting to see who will fall over what first.With its firm grasp on the comedy aspect, Shaun of the Dead delivers an exceptional grade for its creativity. It takes a lot of brain work to be able to think of a story about zombies where our main characters are oblivious to the fact that anything horrible is happening in the world until the second act. That was actually some of my favorite parts of this film. I was there, sitting in the theater, knowing that it was a zombie film (still, can I call it that?), and nearly missing the entire zombie clues going on in the background. My eyes were focused directly on our star and scene-stealer duo, Shaun and Ed. One of my favorite scenes of this film is when Shaun is going to work after the dead have risen and goes through the motions as if nothing strange is happening while there is chaos and destruction all around. How many of us have gone to work and not even noticed anything-different happening in our daily routine. Sometimes we get so caught up in the motion that we miss any different actions. I couldn't stop laughing.What also made this film work on every level was the cast. Director Edgar Wright has done a fantastic job of placing the right actors with the right characters. They were each believable in their own part, and I loved every scene with Bill Nighy. He was perfectly cased and you could just tell that he loved being in this film. That is another great aspect of this film. It was a fun film and you could tell that the cast was having fun with their roles and were comfortable in their environment. So many times we watch these style of films and we see miscasting and uncontrolled actors doing anything to ensure that they stay at the top of people's minds. This wasn't happening in this film. I wasn't familiar with many of the actors, so I couldn't play favorites. All I could do was sit back and enjoy everyone and everything.I would like to end with the comment that this is still a zombie film. It is a love story surrounding a zombie film where the director has chosen to emphasize the love story instead of blowing everything up. I know that sounds strange, but you will get used to it American viewers. I mention that it is still a zombie film because I do not want people going thinking that this is a spoof. While it does pay homage to several of the classic horror films, this film stands on its own two feet. It had blood, it has violence, and it has those infamous scenes of people's heads being blown apart. That is why we see zombie films.Overall, if you love zombie films and you are a fan of The Office or any Hugh Grant film, than Shaun of the Dead will appeal to you. I don't remember the last time I witnessed such a creative film.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,"It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?",1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,3693,"['very', 'hard', 'line', 'cross', 'today', 'cinema', 'make', 'film', 'part', 'comedy', 'horror', 'film', 'Normally', 'when', 'end', 'up', 'something', 'Chucky', 'series', 'began', 'serious', 'seeing', 'new', 'preview', 'know', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'serious', 'horror', 'invaded', 'world', 'campy', 'horror', 'was', 'afraid', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'direction', 'then', 'remembered', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'America', 'was', 'made', 'Britain', 'where', 'humor', 'actually', 'intellectually', 'funny', 'was', 'sitting', 'enjoying', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'America', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'master', 'style', 'film', 'yet', 'Why', 'comedies', 'still', 'heavily', 'based', 'sex', 'humor', 'bathroom', 'jokes', 'were', 'film', 'felt', 'majority', 'humor', 'was', 'logic', 'intelligence', 'based', 'listen', 'words', 'will', 'laugh', 'jokes', 'style', 'comedy', 'instead', 'waiting', 'see', 'who', 'will', 'fall', 'over', 'what', 'firm', 'grasp', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'delivers', 'exceptional', 'grade', 'creativity', 'lot', 'brain', 'work', 'be', 'able', 'think', 'story', 'zombies', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'anything', 'horrible', 'happening', 'world', 'second', 'act', 'was', 'actually', 'favorite', 'parts', 'film', 'was', 'there', 'sitting', 'theater', 'knowing', 'was', 'zombie', 'film', 'still', 'can', 'call', 'nearly', 'missing', 'entire', 'zombie', 'clues', 'going', 'background', 'eyes', 'were', 'focused', 'directly', 'star', 'scene-stealer', 'duo', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'film', 'when', 'Shaun', 'going', 'work', 'dead', 'have', 'risen', 'motions', 'nothing', 'strange', 'happening', 'chaos', 'destruction', 'around', 'How', 'many', 'have', 'gone', 'work', 'not', 'even', 'noticed', 'anything-different', 'happening', 'daily', 'routine', 'Sometimes', 'get', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'motion', 'miss', 'different', 'actions', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing.What', 'also', 'made', 'film', 'work', 'level', 'was', 'cast', 'Director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'done', 'fantastic', 'job', 'placing', 'right', 'actors', 'right', 'characters', 'were', 'believable', 'own', 'part', 'loved', 'scene', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cased', 'could', 'just', 'tell', 'loved', 'being', 'film', 'great', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'film', 'could', 'tell', 'cast', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'roles', 'were', 'comfortable', 'environment', 'So', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'style', 'films', 'see', 'miscasting', 'uncontrolled', 'actors', 'doing', 'anything', 'ensure', 'stay', 'top', 'people', 'minds', 'was', ""n't"", 'happening', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'many', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'play', 'favorites', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'everyone', 'everything.I', 'would', 'like', 'end', 'comment', 'still', 'zombie', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'surrounding', 'zombie', 'film', 'where', 'director', 'chosen', 'emphasize', 'love', 'story', 'instead', 'blowing', 'everything', 'up', 'know', 'strange', 'will', 'get', 'used', 'American', 'viewers', 'mention', 'still', 'zombie', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'people', 'going', 'thinking', 'spoof', 'pay', 'homage', 'several', 'classic', 'horror', 'films', 'film', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'had', 'blood', 'violence', 'infamous', 'scenes', 'people', 'heads', 'being', 'blown', 'apart', 'why', 'see', 'zombie', 'films.Overall', 'love', 'zombie', 'films', 'are', 'fan', 'Office', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'film', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'will', 'appeal', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'witnessed', 'creative', 'film.Grade', '*****', '*****']",Shaun of the Dead

840883,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B0002MJT0I,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[1, 1]","Shaun Of The Dead isn't your typical zombie movie. In fact, the zombies don't truly enter the story until almost a third of the way in. So what's it really about? A man named Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, who lives in London and is a bit of a loser. He works in a dead-end job at an electronic goods store and spends most of his spare time at the local pub or playing video games with his unemployed roomate, Ed. One day Shaun's girlfriend, Liz, decides she's had enough of his lazy attitude and decides to leave him. When the city suddenly gets taken over by the living dead Shaun finds the perfect opportunity to prove himself to Liz, so he sets out to save the day, win his girlfriend back and keep his mum, Barbara, from being eaten by his step-dad who's slowly turning into a zombie.Don't let the title and premise fool you, this isn't a simple spoof of Dawn Of The Dead, it's more a romantic comedy that just so happens to be littered with the undead. The film is also very clever, with a clear social commentary running throughout. The jokes that stem from this are absolutely hilarious but will probably be lost on any non-Londoners. It's actually quite unlikely that this film will translate to anyone outside the UK and this is a real shame and perhaps the films biggest flaw. But if you do get it, then good for you, because there is a lot of great stuff to be seen here. The script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments, such as when Shaun and Ed are looking through Shaun's LP collection for a suitable vinyl to throw at two oncoming zombies, ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"", or when Shaun and his friends beat up an elderly zombie in the pub using cricket bats, all to the rhythm of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. The humour comes thick and fast, never have I laughed so consistantly during any film before, it only pauses briefly for a few dramatic scenes, all of which work surprisingly well. In fact the film tends to genre-hop quite a lot, and while some find this unappealing I think it works in its favour. One minute it's a comedy, then it's a drama and then it's a full blown horror. In fact some scenes are quite jumpy and certainly violent. One extremely gory part in particular is a clear homage to another famous horror film that shall remain unamed, but if you know what I'm talking about when you see it then good for you. That's the thing about this movie though, you don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy it. You just need to have the right sense of humour. Can I explain it? Well, no. You'll just know if the film's for you when you see it. I can assure you that most will like it. If you don't, then I really am sorry for you as this is about the most fun I have had in the cinema since Kill Bill . Ok, that wasn't long ago, but before that I don't think there was a film that was so rip-roaringly funny and then unashamedly brutal at the same time. There is nothing subtle about this movie, and yet it will simply go over the heads of most people. I urge you to watch the film and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it. It's not without its faults though, losing its spark slightly during the third act but it comes back with a vengence and gets in some really good jokes just before the credits roll.Shaun Of The Dead is a great film. It's funny, it's clever and it's got zombies in it! Just when the British film industry appears to be dead this gem pops up and shows us what someone with a sense of humour and a real passion for the media can achieve.

This movie mixes horror with comedy very well, making it a solid comedic performance.The story revolves around Shaun (Simon Pegg), a guy who's kind of going through the motions in life, like a zombie.  His best friend Ed (Nick Frost, who looks a lot like a fatter Weiss from Alias) is even more of a zombified slob, and his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is at the end of her rope with Shaun.  Soon, however, things happen that make relationship troubles small potatoes.  The dead start to rise and try to kill the living.  One of the best things about this movie is that, for a while, no one notices!  One reason is the improbability of it all, but another one is that Shaun and Ed just think that the zombies are drunk, drugged, and tired (social commentary anyone?).  They soon figure out the truth, and the fun begins.Shaun and Ed pick up Liz, some of her friends, and Shaun's mom (Penelope Winton), and head off to a local pub to hide out from the zombies.The movie is, for the most part, full of laughs, although the ending does veer a little more toward the serious end of the spectrum (up until the priceless gag ending that I couldn't see coming).

I am very happy with the ending they chose. I haven't seen a movie with such a clever ending in a while.I thought that the mix of comedy and the mix of ""horror"" went well. Before I watched it, I thought it was going to be more of a comedy than horror, and it was. However I'd say that the horror element they did use wasn't as censored as I thought it would be. There are deaths in the movie, there is blood and biting, etc.This movie is just a parody of movies like ""Dawn Of The Dead"" ""Land Of The Living Dead"", etc. You start out with Shaun and his friend Ed living their lives and eventually Shaun has to deal with a breakup...after the breakup everything just unfolds.  It's like an equivalent of Scary Movie, but a different type of comedic effect. I know there are a lot of people who said that they don't get British comedy, and that they did not see as much humor as they thought they would have in SOTD. I think you just have to pay attention, because yes, some of the humor isn't all out there presented, sometimes the humor is in the image or in facial expressions or actions. I'd recommend to anyone who loves humor (and it's not all crude humor), comedy and zombie movies.

Shaun leads such a dead lifestyle, which is what makes it so funny. The dialogue is fantastic, and I don't know about everyone else, but some moments actually made me jump. It reminded me of the Scream films in this aspect. I could laugh my head off and be sort of scared at the same time.Shaun's girfriend, Liz, breaks up with him because he does nothing. He plays video games, hangs out at the pub, and is unaware of what is happening around him, so much so that he wakes up one morning to find a zombie girl in his backyard and thinks she's just drunk. That is, until she tries to bite him, and he pushes her away and she falls onto a pole that goes through her stomach and she's still ""alive."" So weird. He decides that the best thing to do would be to go get his mom, his ex-girl, and go to the pub, which is of course, a safe place to hide. Yeah. Right. The ending had me laughing so hard I thought I would die. And actually, I began to think that if such zombies took over, this ending could be what could happen!

Thanks to my discovery of ""On Demand"", I found it!. I have to say that I am usually not drawn to British films, or zombie films(with some exceptions), so I never paid much attention to this film. Then the word got out. Having now seen it, the word is right. This movie is a funny, gory blast from start to finish. It has all the zombie cliches in there, and it has a heck of a time having fun with it all. The movie stars Simon Pegg as Shaun, a clerk at a store selling refrigerators and such. His life is a bit of a mess. He is having relationship issues with his girlfriend Liz(Kate Ashfield), his roomates, and his stepfather Phillip(Bill Nighy). But soon, the area is overtaken by zombies. The dead are rising and attacking the living. Get bit, and it's only a matter of time. What's really brilliant about the film is how the script just has all these zombie things popping up in the background and all around Shaun, while our hapless hero just goes on with life as if nothing is going on. It's wonderfully conceived and sharply directed. Before long, Shaun and his friend Ed(Nick Frost), are getting everyone together and battling the zombies to stay alive. Shoot them in the head!. Yes, you are treated to head explosions, and brains splattering here and there. Gotta love it. The movie is also very funny. What was surprising to me, was that the humor was also kind of American as well. The cast itself is up for the fun, and Pegg makes Shaun very likeable and relatable. Nick Frost's Ed is the overgrown college friend 10 years later who never leaves. Nighy is a superb actor(and he's great as Davy Jones in the new ""Pirates"" movie), and he makes the most of his role here as Shaun's stepfather. I wished there was more of him. The movie doesn't really have any huge social significance like the zombie films of George Romero, but it celebrates all the fun of the zombie movie, with having nice humor along for the ride. Some fans don't like the mix, but it works like gangbusters here. Who else can resist our band of heroes fighting the zombies with Queen blaring on the jukebox?. So, what exactly is the plot with the zombies?. Not much. They gave some reason, but really, it's a passing thought. It's all about the gore, the head smacks, the humor, and the notion of this extraordinary thing happening to ordinary people with extra ordinary lives.",4,"""You've Got Red On You....""",1153612800,"07 23, 2006",2006,2477,"['Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'was', 'little', 'gem', 'others', 'were', 'talking', 'was', 'slow', 'catch', 'up', 'Thanks', 'discovery', 'Demand', 'found', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'usually', 'not', 'drawn', 'British', 'films', 'zombie', 'films', 'exceptions', 'so', 'never', 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'film', 'Then', 'word', 'got', 'out', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'word', 'right', 'movie', 'funny', 'gory', 'blast', 'start', 'finish', 'zombie', 'cliches', 'there', 'heck', 'time', 'having', 'fun', 'movie', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Shaun', 'clerk', 'store', 'selling', 'refrigerators', 'such', 'life', 'bit', 'mess', 'having', 'relationship', 'issues', 'girlfriend', 'Liz', 'Kate', 'Ashfield', 'roomates', 'stepfather', 'Phillip', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'soon', 'area', 'overtaken', 'zombies', 'dead', 'are', 'rising', 'attacking', 'living', 'Get', 'bit', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'What', 'really', 'brilliant', 'film', 'how', 'script', 'just', 'zombie', 'things', 'popping', 'up', 'background', 'around', 'Shaun', 'hapless', 'hero', 'just', 'life', 'nothing', 'going', 'wonderfully', 'conceived', 'sharply', 'directed', 'long', 'Shaun', 'friend', 'Ed', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'are', 'getting', 'everyone', 'together', 'battling', 'zombies', 'stay', 'alive', 'Shoot', 'head', 'Yes', 'are', 'treated', 'head', 'explosions', 'brains', 'splattering', 'here', 'there', 'Got', 'ta', 'love', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'What', 'was', 'surprising', 'was', 'humor', 'was', 'also', 'kind', 'American', 'well', 'cast', 'up', 'fun', 'Pegg', 'Shaun', 'very', 'likeable', 'relatable', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'Ed', 'overgrown', 'college', 'friend', '10', 'years', 'later', 'who', 'never', 'Nighy', 'superb', 'actor', 'great', 'Davy', 'Jones', 'new', 'Pirates', 'movie', 'most', 'role', 'here', 'Shaun', 'stepfather', 'wished', 'was', 'more', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'huge', 'social', 'significance', 'zombie', 'films', 'George', 'Romero', 'fun', 'zombie', 'movie', 'having', 'nice', 'humor', 'ride', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'mix', 'gangbusters', 'here', 'Who', 'else', 'can', 'resist', 'band', 'heroes', 'fighting', 'zombies', 'Queen', 'blaring', 'jukebox', 'So', 'what', 'exactly', 'plot', 'zombies', 'Not', 'much', 'gave', 'reason', 'really', 'passing', 'thought', 'gore', 'head', 'smacks', 'humor', 'notion', 'extraordinary', 'thing', 'happening', 'ordinary', 'people', 'extra', 'ordinary', 'lives']",Shaun of the Dead

It is the first really fresh farce I've seen since the ""Airplane""/""Naked Gun"" continuum of cookie cutter comedies started to run in the early 1980's. The movie is well photographed, smart, clever and funny. The humor is a little goofy (imagine if your high school class clown were allowed the budget and resources to make a serious movie), but it is satisfying.There are many current movies that had bigger budgets and can only wish they were as well made and well scripted as ""Shawn of the Dead.""The filmmaker is well versed in traditional zombie movie/""Night of the Living Dead"" cinematic mythology, and you'll see a lot of familiar horror movie symbols skewered.It pains me to say that this movie probably couldn't be made by Americans today (the cast and writers are relentlessly British) because of Hollywood's fear of original and clever thinking. The tradition of British humor which prides itself on originality of thinking is a key element at work in the success of ""Shawn of the Dead."" Of course Hollywood will try to clone the film, but the product will look like all the rest of the recycled spew churned out by domestic filmmakers.Take note Anglophobes: there's nothing in this movie except the accents you won't approve of. In fact, there's little in the film that won't make perfect cultural sense. This is the kind of slacker movie that every Twixster living in his mom's basement from Shepherd's Bush to Malibu dreams of making. It's surely the movie they want to watch.Best of all, since my family purchased the film we've watched it several times. There's always something new to see.

840907,AWNKEM8DAG8PY,B0002MJT0I,Brian Conway,"[1, 1]","As ridiculous as it sounds, the description on the cover of the DVD (""A romantic comedy. With zombies."") is completely true. Shaun of the Dead, of course being a pun on one of Romero's zombie flicks Dawn of the Dead, starts out with a glimpse into a very bad day in Shaun's (Simon Pegg) life: Shaun's flatmate Pete badgers him about his other flatmate and best friend for life Ed (Nick Frost) who is an unemployed slob, his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumps him for being unreliable, and his teenage subordinates at his dead-end job make him feel increasingly old and obsolete. At least it's not the end of the world, right? The next day, Shaun humorously goes about his routine in the exact same way, not taking care to notice the zombie infestation that occured literally overnight until Ed points out a strange girl in the garden. With the truth suddenly dawning on them, Shaun and Ed head out to rescue Liz and her flatmates along with Shaun's mother and stepfather. What seemed like a perfect plan falls victim to increasingly more complicated hitches as the movie goes on until it's no longer a spoof on the zombie genre but a very real, emotionally charged drama set inside the events of a zombie outbreak. Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright continue their series of excellent ideas from their hilarious sitcom Spaced with some of the best screenwriting and directing in years. Shaun of the Dead is every pop culture fanboy's dream: the script is filled to the brim with zombie references from sources as obvious as Night of the Living Dead to the obscure videogame Zombies Ate My Neighbors, not to mention a million other homages to just about every other form of mass media (for example, the debate around The Stone Roses' widely criticized Second Coming in comparison to their debut). Not only does Shaun of the Dead reference those numerous outside sources but it is self-referential as well, the whole second day of the movie being an almost word-for-word recurrence of the first with the dialogue providing a hilarious irony that takes several viewings of the film to fully appreciate. To make things better, the cast's comic timing is superb to the point of almost being able to work telepathically with each other and Edgar Wright's use of camera angles and distinct images not only pays respects to the classics that he so reveres but also demonstrates his enormous talent in creating films with a style all his own. Shaun of the Dead is easily the most rewarding movie of its kind for at least a decade and one can only hope that the excellent output from the geniuses behind it will continue long into the 21st century.",5,Shaun of the Dead (4.5 stars),1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,2642,"['As', 'ridiculous', 'description', 'cover', 'DVD', 'A', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'zombies', 'completely', 'true', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'course', 'being', 'pun', 'one', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'out', 'glimpse', 'very', 'bad', 'day', 'Shaun', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'life', 'Shaun', 'flatmate', 'Pete', 'badgers', 'other', 'flatmate', 'best', 'friend', 'life', 'Ed', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'who', 'unemployed', 'slob', 'girlfriend', 'Liz', 'Kate', 'Ashfield', 'being', 'unreliable', 'teenage', 'dead-end', 'job', 'make', 'feel', 'increasingly', 'old', 'obsolete', 'least', 'not', 'end', 'world', 'right', 'next', 'day', 'Shaun', 'humorously', 'routine', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'not', 'taking', 'care', 'notice', 'zombie', 'infestation', 'occured', 'literally', 'overnight', 'Ed', 'points', 'out', 'strange', 'girl', 'garden', 'truth', 'suddenly', 'dawning', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'head', 'out', 'rescue', 'Liz', 'flatmates', 'Shaun', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'What', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'plan', 'victim', 'increasingly', 'more', 'complicated', 'hitches', 'movie', 'no', 'longer', 'spoof', 'zombie', 'genre', 'very', 'real', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'drama', 'set', 'events', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'continue', 'series', 'excellent', 'ideas', 'hilarious', 'sitcom', 'Spaced', 'best', 'screenwriting', 'directing', 'years', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'pop', 'culture', 'fanboy', 'dream', 'script', 'filled', 'brim', 'zombie', 'references', 'sources', 'as', 'obvious', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'obscure', 'videogame', 'Zombies', 'Ate', 'My', 'Neighbors', 'not', 'mention', 'million', 'other', 'homages', 'just', 'about', 'other', 'form', 'mass', 'media', 'example', 'debate', 'Stone', 'Roses', 'widely', 'criticized', 'Second', 'Coming', 'comparison', 'debut', 'Not', 'only', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'reference', 'numerous', 'outside', 'sources', 'self-referential', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'second', 'day', 'movie', 'being', 'almost', 'word-for-word', 'recurrence', 'first', 'dialogue', 'providing', 'hilarious', 'irony', 'several', 'viewings', 'film', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'cast', 'comic', 'timing', 'superb', 'point', 'almost', 'being', 'able', 'work', 'telepathically', 'other', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'use', 'camera', 'angles', 'distinct', 'images', 'not', 'only', 'respects', 'classics', 'so', 'also', 'enormous', 'talent', 'creating', 'films', 'style', 'own', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'easily', 'most', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'kind', 'least', 'decade', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'excellent', 'output', 'geniuses', 'will', 'continue', 'long', '21st', 'century']",Shaun of the Dead

It begins very well, almost perfectly, the first scenes featuring snappy direction and camera tricks together with amusing 'we're all zombies now' references ie. everybody in a bus queue lifting their mobile phones up and texting in unison.

I almost punched my fist in the air when certain of them got eaten alive. Ok, this is clearly a comedy film parodying the zombie genre, and much of it is indeed very clever and amusing, but some people (I would think especially the american audience) will find the personalities just too irritating to get involved with.

840923,A1L3RWD0VD0A1P,B0002MJT0I,"Cherie Priest ""Cherie Priest""","[13, 14]","I've heard a lot of mixed reaction to this movie, though the buzz is primarily positive -- touting the flick's exceptional funny, its glorious messy, and its marvelous silly.Maybe I'm just a big fat dork who spent too much time in graduate school, but I seemed to plug into this movie on a somewhat different plane of appreciation. For thing one, I didn't think it was terribly funny.  It had its moments, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it a ""comedy."" And for a second thing, I found it genuinely suspenseful -- which is not something you often hear shouted from the applause bandwagon. More often than not I hear that it's ""a laugh riot in the tradition of Scary Movie."" This comparison has been waved around several times in print and online, and it seems wildly off-base to me, if not downright insulting.The Scary Movie franchise, while being fun for what it is, is not supposed to mean anything. It's simple parody, produced for masses which are only marginally discriminatory in their entertainment requirements. SOTD has entirely too much going on inside to be relegated to mere imitation status.George Romero and his apologists have long insisted that the original Dawn of the Dead (and its zombies-in-the-mall theme) was a satire on the mindless consumerism and the tedium of modern life. This is the critical equivalent of putting an evening gown on a pig, but whatever. The very same theme was tackled much more effectively without zombies in American Beauty, and much better with zombies in Shaun of the Dead -- a film which actually manages to make a clever statement on the subject.Much of the perceived hilarity in this film occurs at the beginning and the end, wherein the satire is more light-hearted (if unsubtle). The great conceit of the first thirty-five minutes is that the zombies are encroaching upon Shaun's day-to-day reality bubble ... but he doesn't notice, and at first, neither does anyone else. The drooling, coughing, slowly lumbering undead gradually replace the drooling, coughing, slowly lumbering pulse-bearing characters who have periodic walk-on roles in Shaun's life. But no red flags are raised.Shaun is neither bothered by the change nor molested by the zombies themselves, who (one is led to suspect) view him as one of their own. He wanders through his daily routine as if he's wearing blinders; he's worn a rut between his home and his place of employment, and this rut is so deep that it serves as a psychological buffer. Shaun is furthermore isolated from the impending threat by his post-getting-dumped state of sorrow, which prevents him from paying closer attention to his surroundings.But eventually, the carnage cannot escape the notice of even the hopelessly self-involved Shaun and his filthy-yet-lovable best friend Ed. Action must be taken. His parental units must be rescued. Liz, despite her fresh status of ex-girlfriend, must be saved. Shaun and Ed have, at their collective disposal: one zombiefied roommate's vehicle, a cricket bat, and a plan to seek shelter at a pub called the Winchester.Quoth the Blues Brothers: ""Hit it.""At any rate, although the movie ends on an ""up"" note (more or less) and there were giggles to be had, I found the bulk of the film to be calculated and oppressive -- a deftly executed surgical extraction of a man from his suffocating safety zone, and a grim (yet oddly uplifting) morality fable about appreciating what you have without unthinking presumption. All in all, I thought this was a damn fine film and I really enjoyed it. It made me laugh, it made me think, and it made me cringe.Or maybe that's just the meds talking.",5,damn fine romantic comedy ... with zombies,1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,3621,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'movie', 'buzz', 'primarily', 'positive', 'touting', 'flick', 'exceptional', 'funny', 'glorious', 'messy', 'marvelous', 'silly.Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'big', 'fat', 'dork', 'who', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'graduate', 'school', 'seemed', 'plug', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'different', 'plane', 'appreciation', 'thing', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'terribly', 'funny', 'had', 'moments', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'call', 'comedy', 'second', 'thing', 'found', 'genuinely', 'suspenseful', 'not', 'something', 'often', 'hear', 'shouted', 'applause', 'bandwagon', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'hear', 'laugh', 'riot', 'tradition', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'comparison', 'been', 'waved', 'several', 'times', 'print', 'online', 'wildly', 'off-base', 'not', 'downright', 'insulting.The', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'being', 'fun', 'what', 'not', 'supposed', 'mean', 'anything', 'simple', 'parody', 'produced', 'masses', 'are', 'only', 'marginally', 'discriminatory', 'entertainment', 'requirements', 'SOTD', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'be', 'relegated', 'mere', 'imitation', 'status.George', 'Romero', 'apologists', 'have', 'long', 'insisted', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'zombies-in-the-mall', 'theme', 'was', 'satire', 'mindless', 'consumerism', 'tedium', 'modern', 'life', 'critical', 'equivalent', 'putting', 'evening', 'gown', 'pig', 'very', 'same', 'theme', 'was', 'tackled', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', 'zombies', 'American', 'Beauty', 'much', 'better', 'zombies', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'film', 'actually', 'make', 'clever', 'statement', 'subject.Much', 'perceived', 'hilarity', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'wherein', 'satire', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'unsubtle', 'great', 'conceit', 'first', 'thirty-five', 'minutes', 'zombies', 'are', 'encroaching', 'Shaun', 'day-to-day', 'reality', 'bubble', ""n't"", 'notice', 'first', 'neither', 'anyone', 'else', 'drooling', 'coughing', 'slowly', 'lumbering', 'undead', 'gradually', 'replace', 'drooling', 'coughing', 'slowly', 'lumbering', 'pulse-bearing', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'periodic', 'walk-on', 'roles', 'Shaun', 'life', 'red', 'flags', 'are', 'raised.Shaun', 'neither', 'bothered', 'change', 'molested', 'zombies', 'who', 'one', 'led', 'suspect', 'view', 'one', 'own', 'daily', 'routine', 'wearing', 'blinders', 'rut', 'home', 'place', 'employment', 'rut', 'so', 'deep', 'psychological', 'buffer', 'Shaun', 'furthermore', 'isolated', 'impending', 'threat', 'post-getting-dumped', 'state', 'sorrow', 'paying', 'closer', 'attention', 'surroundings.But', 'eventually', 'carnage', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'notice', 'even', 'hopelessly', 'self-involved', 'Shaun', 'filthy-yet-lovable', 'best', 'friend', 'Ed', 'Action', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'parental', 'units', 'must', 'be', 'rescued', 'Liz', 'fresh', 'status', 'ex-girlfriend', 'must', 'be', 'saved', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'have', 'collective', 'disposal', 'one', 'zombiefied', 'roommate', 'vehicle', 'cricket', 'bat', 'plan', 'seek', 'shelter', 'pub', 'called', 'Winchester.Quoth', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'Hit', 'rate', 'movie', 'up', 'note', 'more', 'less', 'were', 'giggles', 'be', 'had', 'found', 'bulk', 'film', 'be', 'calculated', 'oppressive', 'deftly', 'executed', 'surgical', 'extraction', 'man', 'suffocating', 'safety', 'zone', 'grim', 'yet', 'oddly', 'uplifting', 'morality', 'fable', 'appreciating', 'what', 'have', 'unthinking', 'presumption', 'thought', 'was', 'damn', 'fine', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'made', 'made', 'think', 'made', 'cringe.Or', 'maybe', 'just', 'meds', 'talking']",Shaun of the Dead

Taking a page from the Evil Dead franchise, this film provides plenty of blood, guts, and gut-busting comedy. But what's really brilliant about it is that it doesn't limit itself to comedy and zombie-killing, but also makes subtle commentary about real-life zombies: us.The main character, as the title tells us, is, of course, Shaun (Simon Pegg), a 29-year-old slacker who works in an electronics store with a bunch of teenagers and spends his nights at the Winchester Tavern, getting drunk with his buddy Ed (Nick Frost), who is also crashing at his place, and his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), whose patience with his general apathy is wearing thin.One night, Shaun fails to make proper dinner plans, and Liz dumps him outright, so Shaun and Ed go to the Winchester yet again to drown their sorrows. The next morning, a severely hungover Shaun walks to a nearby convenience store in a trance, not even noticing the carnage around him that has been caused by the walking dead. When he gets back to his house, Shaun and Ed finally figure out that these pale-faced creatures are not, in fact, just drunk, but are actually deadly zombies, and so, after some failed attempts to dispel them by throwing bad records and other such household objects at them, Shaun takes up a cricket bat, and Ed a shovel, and the two of them start whacking zombies. Shaun comes up with a plan: (1) steal roommate Pete's car, (2) pick up Liz, (3) pick up Shaun's mom and kill his step-father who has been bitten by a zombie, (4) go to the Winchester, which is somehow secure, (5) ummm... wait until they go away? Okay, so it's not the best plan in the world, but nobody else seems to have any better ideas.Shaun of the Dead successfully lampoons every bad zombie movie that was ever made, by taking the cliches from them and turning them on their heads. For example, when Shaun procures a shotgun and starts firing on the zombies, he can't hit any of them--of course he can't, he's never even touched a shotgun before! And the screenplay is smart: these characters react as people really would react; they don't immediately know all the answers and they don't come up with great plans for destroying them. They come up with bad plans and then have to figure out step by step what to do to keep from being bitten and becoming zombies themselves.Writer-director Edgar Wright and his co-writer (and star of the film) Simon Pegg decide to take their time in the beginning of the film to establish the characters and their quirks, and this is an excellent strategy, because it sets up everything else that follows. When Simon's strategy is to set up camp at the Winchester, well of course it is, because we know that that's how he thinks. I laughed hysterically for nearly the entire length of the movie, especially so at the end when the fate of the zombies is revealed. It's the perfect ending to an excellent film.",5,Zombie movie for people who laugh at zombie movies,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,2961,"['Mutilating', 'zombies', 'never', 'been', 'funnier', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Taking', 'page', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'franchise', 'film', 'plenty', 'blood', 'guts', 'gut-busting', 'comedy', 'what', 'really', 'brilliant', ""n't"", 'limit', 'comedy', 'zombie-killing', 'also', 'subtle', 'commentary', 'real-life', 'zombies', 'us.The', 'main', 'character', 'title', 'course', 'Shaun', 'Simon', 'Pegg', '29-year-old', 'slacker', 'who', 'electronics', 'store', 'bunch', 'teenagers', 'nights', 'Winchester', 'Tavern', 'getting', 'drunk', 'buddy', 'Ed', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'who', 'also', 'crashing', 'place', 'girlfriend', 'Liz', 'Kate', 'Ashfield', 'patience', 'general', 'apathy', 'wearing', 'thin.One', 'night', 'Shaun', 'make', 'proper', 'dinner', 'plans', 'Liz', 'dumps', 'outright', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'go', 'Winchester', 'yet', 'again', 'drown', 'sorrows', 'next', 'morning', 'severely', 'hungover', 'Shaun', 'walks', 'nearby', 'convenience', 'store', 'trance', 'not', 'even', 'noticing', 'carnage', 'been', 'caused', 'walking', 'dead', 'When', 'back', 'house', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'finally', 'figure', 'out', 'pale-faced', 'creatures', 'are', 'not', 'fact', 'just', 'drunk', 'are', 'actually', 'deadly', 'zombies', 'so', 'failed', 'attempts', 'dispel', 'throwing', 'bad', 'records', 'other', 'such', 'household', 'objects', 'Shaun', 'up', 'cricket', 'bat', 'Ed', 'shovel', 'two', 'start', 'whacking', 'zombies', 'Shaun', 'up', 'plan', '1', 'steal', 'roommate', 'Pete', 'car', '2', 'pick', 'up', 'Liz', '3', 'pick', 'up', 'Shaun', 'mom', 'kill', 'step-father', 'who', 'been', 'bitten', 'zombie', '4', 'go', 'Winchester', 'somehow', 'secure', '5', 'ummm', 'wait', 'go', 'away', 'Okay', 'not', 'best', 'plan', 'world', 'nobody', 'else', 'have', 'better', 'ideas.Shaun', 'Dead', 'successfully', 'bad', 'zombie', 'movie', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'taking', 'cliches', 'turning', 'heads', 'example', 'when', 'Shaun', 'shotgun', 'firing', 'zombies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'never', 'even', 'touched', 'shotgun', 'screenplay', 'smart', 'characters', 'react', 'people', 'really', 'would', 'react', 'do', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'know', 'answers', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'great', 'plans', 'destroying', 'come', 'up', 'bad', 'plans', 'then', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'step', 'step', 'what', 'do', 'keep', 'being', 'bitten', 'becoming', 'zombies', 'themselves.Writer-director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'co-writer', 'star', 'film', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'decide', 'take', 'time', 'beginning', 'film', 'establish', 'characters', 'quirks', 'excellent', 'strategy', 'up', 'everything', 'else', 'When', 'Simon', 'strategy', 'set', 'up', 'camp', 'Winchester', 'well', 'course', 'know', 'how', 'laughed', 'hysterically', 'nearly', 'entire', 'length', 'movie', 'especially', 'so', 'end', 'when', 'fate', 'zombies', 'revealed', 'perfect', 'ending', 'excellent', 'film']",Shaun of the Dead

840932,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0002MJT0I,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","Who knew that such a successful spoof on the zombie movies would come from England? The film has its share of gore, including one very gory scene while it still has its laughs. Pretty short intro mind you.Shaun is basically a slacker. He works at an electronics store, isn't really all that ambitious, and his idea of taking his girlfriend out revolves around taking her to the Winchester, a local pub. He lives with Ed, a slacker worse than he is who plays Timesplitters 2(I think) and doesn't write down people's messages, only his own. There's also Pete, who can't stand Ed of course.Shaun's girlfriend Liz ends up dumping him and noticing a lot of weird things happening around town. But once things due start to happen, he's completely oblivious like the bloody handprints in the store or a very empty street. That changes when a woman appears in their backyard. He pushes her onto a small pole and is impaled...only she stands right back up with a gaping hole in her stomach. Now it gets serious as he tries to fend off the zombies(he doesn't want them called that however) with his girlfriend, Ed, his mother, father-in-law, and Liz's 2 friends.The comedy from the film mainly comes from subtleties or just plain ridiculousness without being off-the-wall. Realizing that zombies can be killed through beheading or massive brain trauma, they start flinging vinyls at them, only to end up singling out certain records because they're too good.The acting is surprisingly strong too with a great scene involving a Reservoir Dogs spoof involving a mexican standoff. The gore is a bit subdued since you're not gonna find anything really really graphics, until near the end anyway.Rent it and gross out your date while still making them laugh.

840933,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0002MJT0I,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[0, 0]","I do enjoy the horror/comedy features, a few of my favorites being Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (1992) aka Braindead, and the Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell Evil Dead features...so why did it take me so long to see this film titled Shaun of the Dead (2004)?  You know what it was?  I had a number of people keep telling me how I had to go see this film and usually, when that happens, I tend to avoid the very film they're pushing as something inside becomes resistant to the pressure...I'll see a movie because I want to, not because some told me I have to...I still haven't read The Da Vinci Code, despite the fact someone even gave me their copy of the book...anyway, the film, co-written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, who also directed, stars Simon Pegg (Mission: Impossible III), as the title character.  Also appearing is Kate Ashfield (Fakers), Nick Frost (""Spaced""), Lucy Davis (""The Office""), Dylan Moran (Notting Hill), Penelope Wilton (Calendar Girls), and Bill Nighy (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), who can soon be seen appearing in Pirates of the Caribbean sequels as a character named Davey Jones, in reference to that old sea legend Davey Jones' locker, and not in reference to the character from the 1960s TV show the Monkees, which was played by an actor of the same name.Shaun (Pegg) has problems...he works a dead end job in a chintzy appliance store (his teenage co-workers consider him the `old timer' being all of 29), he doesn't get along with his step dad Phillip (Nighy), which has strained his relationship with his mother (Wilton), his girlfriend Liz (Ashfield) is in the process of dumping him because she wants more out of their relationship, and his flat mate Pete is on his case about Shaun's friend Ed (Frost), who lives with them but contributes very little...you know the type, a big, greasy bohunk type who stays over one night, and then ends up moving in, sleeping on the couch, doesn't pay rent, drinks milk from the carton, and spends his days playing video games and his nights at the local pub.  Shaun's life is a mess, and it's about to get a whole lot messier, as it seems an American satellite has crashed somewhere in the south of England, resulting in the dead coming back to life, feasting on the flesh of the living, which then creates more of the same...at first Shaun doesn't notice the not so subtle changes of those on the street, until one of the dead wanders into the garden of his flat (at first, Shaun and Ed think the woman is hammered).  As the situation becomes clear, Shaun tries to hold it together, gathering his friends and family with the intent on barricading themselves in the local pub and waiting it out, but the dead are hungry, and if they don't get Shaun and his group, tensions from within surely will...I had a lot of fun with this film, as any fan of the zombie films should, at least those who don't take things too seriously and can stand a movie that pokes a little fun at the genre.  The comedy in the film isn't so much of the slapsticky kind (there is some) featured in the films I referenced at the beginning of my review, but more so a subtle kind that I found really appealing.  While watching the movie one familiar with films that came before can't help but feel those responsible for this feature are true fans of the genre, and horror films in general, given the immense amount of references included, in terms of visuals, the script, and various other aspects of the production, all of which can be identified by activating a special Zomb-O-Meter subtitle track.  I also really enjoyed the thoughtfulness in the structure of the movie, for example, near the beginning, before the influx of the zombies, we see Shaun walking to a nearby store, and there's a good amount of normal, street activity (a kid playing, a man washing his car, a homeless man begging for change, etc.).  The next day, after Shaun got dumped by Liz and subsequently went out with Ed and tied one on, we see a slightly hung over Shaun, walking the same, exact route, except now things are very different.  The streets are clear of people (except for a few presumably walking dead), strewn with trash and in disarray, yet Shaun, given his current state, does not take notice...very funny sequence.  Another great bit was when Shaun and Ed finally realized what was going on, after an incident in the backyard and one of the dead actually entering the flat, because, as usual, someone forgot to lock the front door (this was persistent issue with Shaun's roommate Pete, who despised Ed).  As the story progresses, Shaun seems to come to terms with his relationship issues, generally at the most inopportune moments, one of them being a very touching scene with his step father Phil in the back of a car, just prior to Phil `losing the battle'.  Another great sequence in this regard was when Shaun and Ed had it out, in front of the pub, surrounded by hundreds of dead eyed spectators.  I thought the performances all really good (both Pegg and Frost stood out for me), and the characters completely distinctive and interesting.  The direction was excellent, as the use of various gimmicks done especially well, keeping me interested rather than distracting.  As far as the zombies and special effects in general, I thought they were all done very well, resulting in excellent production values for a film of this type, this type being a relatively independent feature made on a relatively modest budget (this film cost a reportedly 4 million to make, while George Romero's 2005 Land of the Dead cost about 15 million).  The zombie effects are decent enough, and there is one, particularly gut wrenching (literally) near the end which casual viewers might find hard to take.  All in all I thought this an excellent film and a great effort put forth by the filmmakers, one which all fans of the genre should appreciate, but may have limited appeal to the casual viewer not familiar with all the `in' jokes and references (some were obscure, even to me).The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), looks very sharp and clear, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through very clean.  As far as the special features, there are a good amount of them related to the film, of which I won't list as the Amazon website does this well enough, but not so much as to overwhelm...I love those releases where they interview everyone and anyone, despite their peripheral involvement in the making of the film (does anyone care what kind of snackies the caterer supplied during production?).  Also included are some unrelated Universal previews that come up as the DVD is inserted into the player, but these can be bypassed through your remote.  Used to be Universal gave you no choice in watching these things, but I guess they got enough complaints as to allow viewers to bypass them if they wish...Cookieman108",5,"""How's that for a slice of

He can't seem to seperate from his best friend long enough to establish a stable relationship with his girlfriend Liz, but once zombies start eating everyone in sight Shaun has a chance as redemption.  Alongside his mother, his best friend, his girlfriend and her friends they fight for survival against the flesh eating zombies.When I think of spoofs I usually think of the spoofs gone horribly wrong, like most do, but 'Shaun of the Dead' was such a nice diversion from the general crap sludged out by studios today and passed off as entertainment.  It was funny, witty and at some times even a bit scary.  The British humor is not always my cup of tea, but it's approached brilliantly here that every minute is enjoyable.

Shaun of the Dead has a character all its own.  This movie gave me the impression that some people who really wanted to have fun while making a movie got together and did just that.This is like the Scary Movie spoofs, only ten times better.  Simon Pegg, besides in the movie, just seems like the kinda guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with.  He has that ""it"" factor people always talk about - a universal appeal if you will.  He is great at what he does - act.  Pegg makes this movie a blast to watch, and I'll bet he made it a lot of fun to film too.  Hey Pegg, if you read this review, next time you're in Chicago, Illinois, look me up.  I'll meet ya for a brewsky.  Maybe I could write your next film.Kate Ashfield is well...hmmm...how do a I say this?  Easy on the eyes - does a wonderful job as Shaun's girlfriend.  She also seems like a very down-to-earth person who manages to make her role in a spoof movie still be interesting.  Not an easy task.  But that is what this movie does best; it spoofs the zombie genre without going over the edge.  You still care about what happens to the cast, and at the same time have fun watching the zombies try and eat them.  Only this amazing cast (all of you involved can pat yourselves on the back now) could pull that off.Buy this movie!  You'll love it.

But all Shaun cares about his his romance troubles--his girlfriend is breaking up with him.  And when he finally gets attacked by the zombies, he and his slacker roommate decide that they must save her--and Shaun's mother (though they seem delighted at the prospect of killing Shaun's step-father).  What ensues is horrifying, scary, shocking--and absolutely hilarious.This movie is extremely well acted; it's been a long time since I've seen this good of comic-timing in a movie.  And it's also disturbing and even scary; I shivered several times, and was on the edge of my seat the entire 90+ minutes.  And I was laughing the whole time; it's unusual, to be scared and laughing at the same time.There's also a bonus aspect of this movie: it serves as a great social commentary.  Lots can be said about the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film, as Shaun ambles about the city, oblivious of the world slowly falling apart around him; and then, when he is forced to face the zombies, how he insists upon dealing with mundane things...for example, when he hits a man with his car, he backs up to see if the man is alright.  When the guy turns out to be a zombie, Shaun sighs and says, ""Well, that's alright then.""Hilarious.  ""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of those flicks you can watch again and again, because it's that good.

840943,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B0002MJT0I,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[12, 13]","Look: stop griping. Stop worrying about your lives. Shaun, eponymous cricket-bat wielding hero and ambitionless Foree Electronics employee, has *real* problems. For instance:1) His love life sucks.2) His professional life sucks.3) His best friend is a hopeless slacker who has turned his couch into a kind of fetid nest and spends his entire days wasting away playing X-Box.4) Oh, and the Dead Walk: Zombies are walking the streets of London and tearing up flesh, and they're equal opportunity offenders with a taste for the guts of any Briton, yuppie *or* slacker.This is one of those rare little horror gems in which you can believe the hype---and frankly, when I went to see ""Shaun of the Dead"", I was already set *against* the movie: I hate flicks that come to the megaplex ready to do battle after having been given a Super Hype Aerial Shock & Awe campaign by the Indie Movie Establishment.I stand corrected: ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a zombie movie/horror movie/movie-of-all-time classic, and easily ranks in my top three zombie movies ever made. And mind you, I live, eat, breathe, sleep, and chainsaw these things. Yes, those who hate horror will tell you they love ""Shaun"" because it's all about ""characters"": ; Shaun (Simon Pegg, the flick's writer and note-perfect as the reluctant zombie slayer), a one-time pathetic directionless loser who gets *very* good with a cricket bat; Liz (Kate Ashfield, very plummy), Shaun's disaffected squeeze who wants to ""live a little""; Mum (Penelope Wilton as ""Barbara""), always looking on the Sunny Side even when she's undergoing a really major life change (as in, dietary change, as in, sudden interest in blood and guts); Philip (the amazing English actor Bill Nighy, who I didn't even recognize in this flick---he played the Uber-Vampire Viktor in ""Underworld""---who knew?), who takes care of his Jaguar to the bitter end.Yeah, it has characters.But you know something? ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a full-bodied, full-blooded horror movie. It's just one of those rarest of ghoulish gemstones: a horror movie with a wickedly black sense of humor and an impeccable, deeply British, sense of timing. And the timing here is perfect. For my money, the scene in which Shaun goes for some beer in his devastated, zombie-overrun London burb---completely oblivious to the carnage---is one of the best sequences in cinematic history.I haven't seen ""Spaced"", the TV series that ""Shaun"" director Edgar Wright helmed, but I can say that for a relative newcomer Wright can wield a mean camera. He's backed up by cinematographer David Dunlap, who serves as heavy weapons tech on on the cinematic black magic: my God, this movie looks good! And let's back up a bit---this flick was shot for 4 million bucks. For 4 million bucks, Edgar Wright has conjured up a trillion times the ungodly flesh-eating slack-jawed glassy-eyed zombie horror that ""Resident Evil 2"" did---and *that* movie cost 10 times that much. Question: which flick delivered the most pure, unadulterated, zombie-brain-blasting goodness?""Shaun of the Dead"" succeeds, largely, by animating more than just dead bodies. First off, don't believe the ""romantic comedy"" angle---yeah, Shaun has to square the circle with his lovey, but this is a brutal, no holds-barred, don't skimp on the Red Sauce and juicy intestines Captain kinda flick. It's intensely horrific, insanely gripping, and happily disgusting. I wasn't expecting that.And best of all, this is one of the few zombie flicks that really burrow down into the guts of what it's like to have to put down someone you love: someone who's confused, who loved you, who tucked you into bed at night when you were a kid, who now exists for one thing and one thing only---to tear off the top of your scalp and sink her cancred yellow tusks into your brainpan. ""Shaun of the Dead"" brings it all home with a double-basrreled shotgun of dread, and for that I salute Edgar Wright.But look: the real triumph of ""Shaun of the Dead"" is that it sets up a seamless, banal, everyday urban environment, and overruns it with pure horror. And you *believe* it. You are engaged: when Shaun and Ed (Nick Frost in priceless rat-faced X-Box playing slacker mode) confront a zombie in their backyard, they don't know what to do with the thing. Is she drunk? They laugh, up to the point where she bares her fangs and tries to give Shaun an impromptu tracheotomy.Now: watch Shaun and Ed's reaction when they're putting their first zombie down. This is not irony: not humor: not comedy: it's pure, unadulterated horror and something more---and that something more is what fuels ""Shaun of the Dead"", and makes it the classic it is: it is a ferocious, angry sadness---indignation!---at the passing of the world they knew, the world of X-Box, Indian take-out, ruthless slacking, late-night binges, and drinking bouts at the Winchester. It's the end of the world as we know it, and we don't feel fine. To be honest, we feel murderous.

It is a laugh riot but the looming horror keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The film that I think comes closest as far as marrying these elements is ""An American Werewolf in London"" from 1981 but I think this film is more successful.  The films conceit is that prior to confronting real zombies, Shaun is in fact a zombie.  That point is obvious and it's not beaten into the ground.  It's not until Shaun has to do battle with the real McCoy that he breaks out of his funk.  Pegg is excellent in the title role, handling both the comic and action demands superbly.  Nick Frost as Ed, Shaun's best friend, is a hoot.  Not since John Belushi's Bluto in ""Animal House"" in 1978 has the screen seen such a memorably unapologetic slob.

The writing is suprisingly intelligent and altogether tongue-in-cheek.  The gore is everywhere and so realistic as to invoke heartfelt cringing...often followed by a burst of laughter.  I want to relate sequences that are not only funny but sociologically profound (no kidding), but to give away these scenes would spoil the effect of the film.  As with George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" there is more depth to this film than at first glance, with comparisons between zombies and mankind that are blurred to the point of being almost identical.  Once again I have to inhibit myself from giving away too much.  Yet another additive that sets this film apart from the rest of the genre is that all the characters are worth rooting for and caring about.  There are actually some touching scenes with authentic emotions indicating that although there are many ridiculous moments loaded with humor, these are real people caught in a life or death situation.  The way this film shifts from true horror and pain to slapstick (sometimes literally ""slapstick"") makes this a remarkable creation.  There are many subtle, sometimes vague references to many films such as ""Resevoir Dogs,"" ""Snatch,"" ""28 Days Later,"" the two aforementioned walking dead films, and even a mood-altering thud in the score that reminded me of John Carpenter's ""The Thing.""

Really, what more do you need to hear.Many people mistakenly think this is a spoof movie or a parody of Dawn of the Dead, the remake of which came out unfortunatally close to the release of Shaun (I think there's even a Shaun trailer on the Dawn DVD) and the names are similar, but this is not the case.  Shaun of the Dead is a great zombie movie in its own right and nails both the horror and the comedy.The comedy in the film is so slick you may have to watch multiple times to catch it all.  It is that almost dry but witty British humor that when done right can be ten times as funny as the loud in your face humor we get in the states.  You need to listen to all the quips from Shaun's loser buddy Ed (who has an excellen loser gap cut into his hair.  Just something you have to notice to realize how funny that is) pay attention to all the back ground action (was that couple making out or was she just eating his neck?) and watch closly to get all the cool little jokes.  Don't worry there are still some nice fall down humor and inappropriate words to giggle at.You can see the love of the zombie films these film makers have and the layers they use to tell their story is amazing.  In a pair of inventive scenes we see Shuan walking down the street like a zombie himself to the store not noticing the world around him because he just does not care.  Later we see him on the same walk, this time not noticing anything because he's thinking about sorting his life out and not noticing that a zombie invasion is begining around him (another great background scene by the way). Also inventive is the use of foreshadowing.  Notice when Ed says they should drink all day tomorrow starting with a bloody mary and ending up at the pub that this is what happens... kind of.  Notice the name tag of the first zombie they bloody up and where they end up at the end of the day.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Zombies are one of those horror staples that have gotten putrid, after one too many idiotic blood'n'gore-fests with a revolting script. Like poor Dracula, they run out of things to do.But zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny ""Shaun of the Dead,"" a tale of music, love, pubs, and the slobbering undead. In the vein of Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive,"" it's full of twisted humour, funny dialogue and plenty of gore.Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are the poster boys for adolescentus slackeritis, living in a London flat with their peeved roommate Pete, who has actually grown up and gotten a real job. Ed plays video games all day, and Shaun's immaturity has just gotten him dumped by his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).Wrapped up in his love life woes, Shaun fails to notice a little news item: Human beings all over London are transforming into zombies. At first, Shaun obliviously drowns his sorrows, and has a nasty encounter when he goes to pick up a soda. Now he must mend his relationship with Liz and defend himself and his family from the hordes of ravenous zombies... by barricading them in a pub.""Shaun"" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. The heroes don't even have guns (since the UK public don't get them), and so our heroes fend off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. That gives an idea of how serious this movie is.""Shaun of the Dead"" isn't so much a zombie movie as a love story with zombies -- a very funny one, with lots of gore. We're treated to slackers in love, Shaun drifting obliviously around London withoutn noticing the undead, and some very entertaining dialogue (""Just look at the face: it's vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet..."")Later on, he's forced to shake off his obliviousness in order to save his loved ones, with a bat as his only weapon. And maybe some commandos in a tank. It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. Not sex-organ/bathroom humor, but definitely not highbrow.Everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed. Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how to go about it. Frost is a good annoying sidekick for Shaun, and Ashfield does a good job as the long-suffering girlfriend.As a bonus, music geeks will laugh themselves silly over such important decisions as: which albums should our reluctant heroes throw at the zombies? ""Stone Roses?"" ""No."" ""...Second Coming?"" ""I liked it."" ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"" Good choice, Shaun m'boy.While it's a hilarious movie, it's not a spoof -- rather it's a zombie movie with wit, love and comedy.

Somehow, from all the people I talked too, no one decided to mention that buried beneath the comedy and romance, lay an extremely well crafted horror movie.The movie is extremely funny in a British way, like a new generation of Monty Python. Its played wacky at some moments and serious, but really funny, at other times.  And it's this balance between the two that make this movie as funny as it is. The movie is also a nice homage to past George Romero zombie films, which I really enjoyed because I'm a big fan of that whole trilogy.The movie centers on Shaun, a lay about slacker and his friend who is an even bigger slacker and one of those guys that most people just don't like.  Shaun has a girlfriend, whose tired of always going to the same pub, and fed up with hanging out with Shaun's same friend. She ends their relationship and the next day the country is overrun with zombies.  Now Shaun and his friend are on the run, trying to save his ex-girlfriend as well as his mum and stepdad who he's not to fond of.Hilarity ensues as arguements over which old records should be used as weapons and where they should go after rescuing everyone.  And what better place to go than the local pub.As everyone gathers together the movie takes on the feel of Night of the Living Dead with everybody in the group not getting along so well.  Shaun becomes an unlikely hero all while trying to protect his mum and win back his girl.  The violence and gore in the movie was something that suprised me, albeit, a very welcome surpise. But its the reason the movie worked so well.  It was able to so finely walk the line between good horror movie, great comedy and winning romance all wrapped into one nice little package.Another welcome return is the walking zombies.  I don't mind the running ones, from last years Dawn of the Dead remake or 28 Days Later(although I would be more inclined to argue that they weren't really zombies, just people hopped up on a disease that caused rage, but whatever), but I grew up on the walking zombies and find them to be a little bit more scary.All and all, a great horror comedy with decent DVD extras.",4,The fine line between horror and comedy.,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,2191,"['ever', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'funny', 'was', 'Somehow', 'people', 'talked', 'too', 'one', 'decided', 'mention', 'buried', 'comedy', 'romance', 'lay', 'extremely', 'well', 'crafted', 'horror', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'extremely', 'funny', 'British', 'way', 'new', 'generation', 'Monty', 'Python', 'played', 'wacky', 'moments', 'serious', 'really', 'funny', 'other', 'times', 'balance', 'two', 'make', 'movie', 'as', 'funny', 'movie', 'also', 'nice', 'homage', 'past', 'George', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'films', 'really', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'whole', 'trilogy.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'Shaun', 'lay', 'slacker', 'friend', 'who', 'even', 'bigger', 'slacker', 'one', 'guys', 'most', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Shaun', 'girlfriend', 'tired', 'always', 'going', 'same', 'pub', 'fed', 'up', 'hanging', 'out', 'Shaun', 'same', 'friend', 'relationship', 'next', 'day', 'country', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'Now', 'Shaun', 'friend', 'are', 'run', 'trying', 'save', 'ex-girlfriend', 'as', 'well', 'mum', 'stepdad', 'who', 'not', 'fond', 'of.Hilarity', 'ensues', 'arguements', 'old', 'records', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'weapons', 'where', 'should', 'go', 'rescuing', 'everyone', 'what', 'better', 'place', 'go', 'local', 'pub.As', 'everyone', 'together', 'movie', 'feel', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'everybody', 'group', 'not', 'getting', 'along', 'so', 'well', 'Shaun', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'trying', 'protect', 'mum', 'win', 'back', 'girl', 'violence', 'gore', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'suprised', 'albeit', 'very', 'welcome', 'surpise', 'reason', 'movie', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'able', 'so', 'finely', 'walk', 'line', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'great', 'comedy', 'winning', 'romance', 'wrapped', 'one', 'nice', 'little', 'package.Another', 'welcome', 'return', 'walking', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'running', 'ones', 'last', 'years', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'inclined', 'argue', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'zombies', 'just', 'people', 'hopped', 'up', 'disease', 'caused', 'rage', 'grew', 'up', 'walking', 'zombies', 'find', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'scary.All', 'great', 'horror', 'comedy', 'decent', 'DVD', 'extras']",Shaun of the Dead

The first time was because the theater that was supposed to be playing abruptly changed their schedule and didn't notify the papers. The second time was because I had brought a pretty girl with me (Hormones and whatnot, you understand), and, since she was only 16, they would not let us in. It was the only time I'd EVER been carded (I've been able to pass for a man in his thirties since I was 17), and we couldn't see it. I was in pain, which only increased when she decided we should see THE GRUDGE instead.Luckily, this movie proved to be worth all the trouble and wait. It's hilarious and horrifying, often at the same time. Shaun and Ed are two very believable slackers who I'd very much like to hang out with. And they handle the situation pretty much like every other slacker I know would: Badly. But they more or less get through it.Mind you, this movie does seem to shift attitudes a lot. One second it's goofy comedy, the next it's suspense, the next it's flat out gory horror. It may get on some people's nerves. It didn't mine, so I ended up loving the flick. This would make an excellent double feature with the new DAWN OF THE DEAD. You can compare the filmmaker's attitudes toward the whole zombie genre.

This particular comedy, co-written by Edgar Wright and Britcom actor Simon Pegg (""Spaced"") is a true homage to the old Romero zombie movies, with plenty of hints to let fellow fans know where they got their ideas.Unlike this summer's remade ""Dawn of the Dead"", this movie stays true to the old formula.  Low budgets, decent acting, dark humor, blood, and of course, tons of slow moving zombie extras.  The mixture of this classic formula with a North London flair is successful,and though the British humor is familiar, it is also fresh and well, funny.This is a good movie to see with the lights off, as there are some pretty scary bits.  Lots of good spooks and scenes lifted straight from the old Romero trilogy will leave fans howling in delight.The only downside to this movie is a subplot involving Shaun and his ex girlfriend.  While the acting is good enough to be believable,the plot still felt tacked on a bit.Finally, the DVD has a bunch of great extras.  There are several deleted scenes, bits of tv shows that were sampled for the movie, the usual cast & Crew stuff, as well as three ""plot hole"" fillers, which give answers to some of the few inconsistencies in the movie.This was easily one of the better films of 2004 and the DVD has all the extras to make the purchase worth while.",4,"not quite a spoof, more like George Romero's stepchild",1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,1399,"['comedy', 'parodies', 'go', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'better', 'anything', 'old', 'movies', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'particular', 'comedy', 'co-written', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'Britcom', 'actor', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Spaced', 'true', 'homage', 'old', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'movies', 'plenty', 'hints', 'let', 'fellow', 'fans', 'know', 'where', 'got', 'ideas.Unlike', 'summer', 'remade', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'movie', 'true', 'old', 'formula', 'Low', 'budgets', 'decent', 'acting', 'dark', 'humor', 'blood', 'course', 'tons', 'slow', 'moving', 'zombie', 'extras', 'mixture', 'classic', 'formula', 'North', 'London', 'flair', 'successful', 'British', 'humor', 'familiar', 'also', 'fresh', 'well', 'funny.This', 'good', 'movie', 'see', 'lights', 'off', 'are', 'pretty', 'scary', 'bits', 'Lots', 'good', 'spooks', 'scenes', 'lifted', 'straight', 'old', 'Romero', 'trilogy', 'will', 'leave', 'fans', 'howling', 'delight.The', 'only', 'downside', 'movie', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Shaun', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'acting', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'believable', 'plot', 'still', 'felt', 'tacked', 'bit.Finally', 'DVD', 'bunch', 'great', 'extras', 'are', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bits', 'tv', 'shows', 'were', 'sampled', 'movie', 'usual', 'cast', 'Crew', 'stuff', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'plot', 'hole', 'fillers', 'give', 'answers', 'few', 'inconsistencies', 'movie.This', 'was', 'easily', 'one', 'better', 'films', '2004', 'DVD', 'extras', 'make', 'purchase', 'worth']",Shaun of the Dead

840986,A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,B0002MJT0I,"Erik Olson ""Seeker Reviews""","[22, 26]","""Shaun of the Dead"" (SotD) has been hyped by the AICN pundits for some time before its actual release.  Although I don't always buy into their raves, this was an exception.  I can't resist apocalyptic movies, especially when zombies are involved (and I don't care if they are Slow or Fast, if you get my drift.  Each type has their respective merits).  Of course, three things must occur to prevent disappointment with any zombie movie: 1) good story, 2) cool characters, and 3) mayhem - lots of mayhem.  SotD has all three, and done well enough so I'd pay to see the movie again.The plot of SotD is somewhat typical - ordinary people are caught up in extraordinary events, and they must rise to the occasion or die.  Nothing original about that, but this time the execution is superb.  As other critics have noted, this movie works on many levels, and all of them combine to more than satisfy my three requirements listed above.  A couple things in particular stand out:First, the humor is superlative, and I can't rave enough about it.  There's plenty of in-joke references to past zombie movies, from the original Romero ""Dead"" trilogy to last year's ""28 Days Later.""  In addition, the humorous aspects of horror conventions are explored without insulting them.  For example, the whole ""kill a zombie by killing the brain"" staple is exploited for laughs in a country where personal gun ownership is almost non-existent.  Thankfully, us Yanks will never have to rely on cricket bats and vinyl Sade albums to rid our backyards of zombies.  The number of laugh-out-loud moments alone are enough to recommend this flick.Second, the horror aspect is well done. As any genre fan knows, gore is a zombie-movie staple (normally gore is not my thing, but hey - you can't have a self-respecting zombie movie without it, for heaven's sake).  What do you expect, with cannibalistic reanimated corpses that can only be stopped by extreme methods?  SotD delivers plenty of gruesome human-zombie interactions, particularly during the climactic last stand at Shaun's beloved Winchester pub.  And more importantly, Slow Zombie purists the world over will finally get their due, after being ignored by recent films that favored the quicker and more agile zombie variant.Finally, the relationships between the characters and their personal struggles ring true, and will appeal to any self-respecting Gen-Xer.  Shaun is the prototypical ""male struggling against manhood"" character, trying to hold off the twin devils of responsibility and purpose for as long as possible.  His crisis transformation from slacker to savior is nicely done.  The chemistry between the main characters is spot-on, and it didn't take long for me to identify with them and care about their fates.  A good portion of the comedy results from their interactions, especially between Shaun and his slovenly roommate/best friend Ed.  However, there are also moments of genuine feeling, as when Shaun and his long-despised stepfather have their final exchange.  Indeed, the actors are the real reason this movie works, and without exception they do a commendable job.The last two years have seen a welcome resurgence of the zombie genre, with ""28 Days Later"", the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, and now the excellent ""Shaun of the Dead.""  Get all three for your horror library, and prepare for the day when there's no more room in hell (or pub).",5,Best Rom-Com-Zom Movie Ever?,1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,3394,"['Shaun', 'Dead', 'SotD', 'been', 'hyped', 'AICN', 'pundits', 'time', 'actual', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'buy', 'raves', 'was', 'exception', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'apocalyptic', 'movies', 'especially', 'when', 'zombies', 'are', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'are', 'Slow', 'Fast', 'get', 'drift', 'type', 'respective', 'merits', 'course', 'three', 'things', 'must', 'occur', 'prevent', 'disappointment', 'zombie', 'movie', '1', 'good', 'story', '2', 'cool', 'characters', '3', 'mayhem', 'lots', 'mayhem', 'SotD', 'three', 'done', 'well', 'enough', ""'d"", 'pay', 'see', 'movie', 'again.The', 'plot', 'SotD', 'somewhat', 'typical', 'ordinary', 'people', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'extraordinary', 'events', 'must', 'rise', 'occasion', 'die', 'Nothing', 'original', 'time', 'execution', 'superb', 'other', 'critics', 'have', 'noted', 'movie', 'many', 'levels', 'combine', 'more', 'satisfy', 'three', 'requirements', 'listed', 'above', 'couple', 'things', 'particular', 'stand', 'First', 'humor', 'superlative', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rave', 'enough', 'plenty', 'in-joke', 'references', 'past', 'zombie', 'movies', 'original', 'Romero', 'Dead', 'trilogy', 'last', 'year', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'addition', 'humorous', 'aspects', 'horror', 'conventions', 'are', 'explored', 'insulting', 'example', 'whole', 'kill', 'zombie', 'killing', 'brain', 'staple', 'exploited', 'laughs', 'country', 'where', 'personal', 'gun', 'ownership', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'Thankfully', 'Yanks', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'rely', 'cricket', 'bats', 'vinyl', 'Sade', 'albums', 'rid', 'backyards', 'zombies', 'number', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'alone', 'are', 'enough', 'recommend', 'flick.Second', 'horror', 'aspect', 'well', 'done', 'genre', 'fan', 'gore', 'zombie-movie', 'staple', 'normally', 'gore', 'not', 'thing', 'hey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'self-respecting', 'zombie', 'movie', 'heaven', 'sake', 'What', 'do', 'expect', 'cannibalistic', 'reanimated', 'corpses', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'stopped', 'extreme', 'methods', 'SotD', 'plenty', 'gruesome', 'human-zombie', 'interactions', 'particularly', 'climactic', 'last', 'stand', 'Shaun', 'beloved', 'Winchester', 'pub', 'more', 'importantly', 'Slow', 'Zombie', 'world', 'will', 'finally', 'get', 'due', 'being', 'ignored', 'recent', 'films', 'favored', 'quicker', 'more', 'agile', 'zombie', 'variant.Finally', 'relationships', 'characters', 'personal', 'struggles', 'ring', 'true', 'will', 'appeal', 'self-respecting', 'Gen-Xer', 'Shaun', 'prototypical', 'male', 'struggling', 'manhood', 'character', 'trying', 'hold', 'off', 'twin', 'devils', 'responsibility', 'purpose', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'crisis', 'transformation', 'slacker', 'savior', 'nicely', 'done', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'spot-on', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'identify', 'care', 'fates', 'good', 'portion', 'comedy', 'results', 'interactions', 'especially', 'Shaun', 'slovenly', 'roommate/best', 'friend', 'Ed', 'However', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'when', 'Shaun', 'long-despised', 'stepfather', 'have', 'final', 'exchange', 'Indeed', 'actors', 'are', 'real', 'reason', 'movie', 'exception', 'do', 'commendable', 'job.The', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'welcome', 'resurgence', 'zombie', 'genre', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake', 'now', 'excellent', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Get', 'three', 'horror', 'library', 'prepare', 'day', 'when', 'more', 'room', 'hell', 'pub']",Shaun of the Dead
840987,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B0002MJT0I,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[2, 2]","Shaun of the Dead is a British comedy that represents a spoof of the now popular zombie-movie genre that has movies coming into release quicker than you can say ""Zombie Nation."" Although it pokes fun of movies such as ""28 Days Later"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""Day of the Dead"", it does so while still trying to be a horror movie. Well, kind of. For the definite fact is, this is ultimately a comedy through and through.Shaun lives in London in his humdrum world and his slacker, slob-of-a-roommate, Ed. Shaun has been experiencing some friction with his girlfriend because of his less-than-appealing style of living. Shaun's other roommate wants Ed out, but Shaun is reluctant to do anything about it, especially since he likes to watch television and go to the pub and drink as much as Ed does. While trying to patch things up with his girlfriend and getting his mind off his doldrums Ed and Shaun realize that the people who are stumbling around London are not in fact drunk, but rather ZOMBIES! They must make a plan to stop the influx of man-eating stumbling zombies that are packing the city, but all time, make sure they get some television in all the while. Shaun must also try to save his mother and girlfriend from the fate of the flesh-eating creatures.When I first saw the previews for this movie I was reluctant to want to watch it. It seemed like some lame comedy that would bring forth few if any laughs. I was very impressed, however, and this movie was much more than I could have anticipated. For one thing, this is not a movie that beats you over the head (pardon the expression, as the characters do beat the zombies over the head, but not my point) with laughs, but rather makes slight jokes at the expense of the horror-style genre. For instance, when Shaun and Ed first are encountered with the zombies approaching their home, they try to kill them using the sharp part of the Shaun's record album collection. However, rather than just flinging them at the zombies, they go through each one to make sure it is not one of Shaun's favorites. Awhile later, they are calmly having a discussion as they are pounding zombies with shovels.As one reviewer noted, the latter part of the movie is probably the part that drags a little and is not quite as humorous. Still, I felt like the movie was fun, and definitely a ""popcorn"" style movie (if you can keep your stomach that is). If you enjoy a good spoof, and especially if you are up with the zombie-movie flicks, this is one you should definitely try out.4 stars.",4,Zombie Nation,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,2558,"['Shaun', 'Dead', 'British', 'comedy', 'spoof', 'now', 'popular', 'zombie-movie', 'genre', 'movies', 'coming', 'release', 'quicker', 'can', 'say', 'Zombie', 'Nation', 'fun', 'movies', 'such', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Day', 'Dead', 'so', 'still', 'trying', 'be', 'horror', 'movie', 'Well', 'kind', 'definite', 'fact', 'ultimately', 'comedy', 'through.Shaun', 'lives', 'London', 'humdrum', 'world', 'slacker', 'slob-of-a-roommate', 'Ed', 'Shaun', 'been', 'experiencing', 'friction', 'girlfriend', 'less-than-appealing', 'style', 'living', 'Shaun', 'other', 'roommate', 'Ed', 'out', 'Shaun', 'reluctant', 'do', 'anything', 'especially', 'watch', 'television', 'go', 'pub', 'drink', 'as', 'much', 'Ed', 'trying', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'getting', 'mind', 'doldrums', 'Ed', 'Shaun', 'realize', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'stumbling', 'London', 'are', 'not', 'fact', 'drunk', 'rather', 'ZOMBIES', 'must', 'make', 'plan', 'stop', 'influx', 'man-eating', 'stumbling', 'zombies', 'are', 'packing', 'city', 'time', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'television', 'while', 'Shaun', 'must', 'also', 'try', 'save', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'fate', 'flesh-eating', 'creatures.When', 'first', 'saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'was', 'reluctant', 'want', 'watch', 'seemed', 'lame', 'comedy', 'would', 'bring', 'forth', 'few', 'laughs', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'however', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'anticipated', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'movie', 'head', 'expression', 'characters', 'do', 'beat', 'zombies', 'head', 'not', 'point', 'laughs', 'rather', 'slight', 'jokes', 'expense', 'horror-style', 'genre', 'instance', 'when', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'first', 'are', 'encountered', 'zombies', 'approaching', 'home', 'try', 'kill', 'using', 'sharp', 'part', 'Shaun', 'record', 'album', 'collection', 'However', 'rather', 'just', 'flinging', 'zombies', 'go', 'one', 'make', 'sure', 'not', 'one', 'Shaun', 'favorites', 'Awhile', 'later', 'are', 'calmly', 'having', 'discussion', 'are', 'pounding', 'zombies', 'shovels.As', 'one', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'latter', 'part', 'movie', 'probably', 'part', 'little', 'not', 'quite', 'humorous', 'Still', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'definitely', 'popcorn', 'style', 'movie', 'can', 'keep', 'stomach', 'enjoy', 'good', 'spoof', 'especially', 'are', 'up', 'zombie-movie', 'flicks', 'one', 'should', 'definitely', 'try', 'out.4', 'stars']",Shaun of the Dead
840988,AUP7XVV60FW1N,B0002MJT0I,Frank Adamson,"[1, 1]","Like all good parodies, ""Shaun of the Dead"" manages to both mock and provide a good example of the genre it's spoofing. Bloody, morbid, and even a bit scary, this film is also so funny you may find yourself laughing at an embarassing volume. Granted, the gallows humor may be too dark for many--a graphic disembowelment may kill the movie for some viewers--but for those who take a secret delight in watching civilization and human relationships get pushed to the brink, this movie will entertain even after multiple viewings.Oddly enough, the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a deadpan (har har) satire on American consumerism, and it's fun to see those themes reemerge in a more obviously humorous setting. The opening credits make it clear that zombies are already among us, and they are us. Yet somehow a man who's grown dead to life manages to rise (""from his couch,"" as the trailer proclaims) to grasp onto a few fleeting moments left in the face of worldwide destruction.

840996,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B0002MJT0I,General Zombie,"[1, 1]","I was really looking forward to seeing 'Shaun of the Dead', and since it never came to any local theaters despite the fact that it was outperforming half the films showing at those places even with a limited release, I got to look forward to seeing it even longer. (um, yay. A fate to which House of Flying Daggers is no doubt consigned)  Fortunately, it proved  to be more than worth the wait, and was definitely  one of the best movies in a fairly ho-hum year.  As far as comedies go, I think this movie's about as good as it gets.  Of course, I'm a big horror fan, and a big zombie fan, in particular, so this is pretty much aimed right at me.  Still, 'Shaun of the Dead' probably has a lot more general appeal than your typical Horror-Comedy, and I think it should appeal to must people who like comedies that, ya know, don't suck.Alright, basic setup.  Shaun is a 29 year old guy, who's kinda aimless and going nowhere, at least partially due to his bestfriend/roomate Ed, who's a fat, immature loser.  So, his girlfriend, Liz, dumps him, and he and Ed get really drunk, and where ever the film was heading before is interrupted, as England is then overrun by zombies.  Unlike the more famous horror-comedy films (Evil Dead II, Re-Animator, Dead-Alive), this film actually takes itself fairly seriously at times. (Particularly towards the end, where the characters are all holed in together, appear to be pretty much doomed, and start fighting one another.)  Some people have gone so far as to say this is more Horror film than Comedy, which is massively overstating it, but it's certainly not purely light-hearted fare either. Lots of people think this is a bad thing, but I certainly don't.  It works very well both when it's trying to be funny and when it's trying to be serious/dramatic/touching, and I always like films that are willing to play with tone.(one of the best aspects of the original Dawn of the Dead, imo)  I also particularly like the  more serious bits, because it makes it abundantly obvious that the makers of the film have a genuine affection for the genre they're parodying.The film has a level a visual flair and an attention to detail which are pretty extraordinary for a comedy, and quite impressive, regardless of genre.  They use lots of great long, steadicam shots and some fun, ultra-kinetic, rapid fire editing. (used to comedic, rather than dramatic effect)  The detail comes in how there's lots going on in the background, and how the film likes to repeat similar scenarios, before and after the zombie attack, and of course, the numerous references to other films.  They're particularly fond of referencing the original Living Dead trilogy, naturally, with a particular penchant for the Evil Dead films as well.  Still, it doesn't rely on Horror films alone, referencing The Deer Hunter and Reservoir Dogs, and British tv shows, and probably lots of other stuff I didn't catch.  I also like how it has the will to be subtle- you probably won't notice the references if you aren't familiar with the original material. (i.e. there aren't any moments in the film where it's abundantly obvious that what someone did/said was a reference so something, but you don't know what it is.  At least there weren't for me)Reviewing comedies is hard.  All I can say is that I though it was funny. Very funny.  It smarter than your average comedy, I suppose, but it isn't afraid of slapstick or lowbrow humor either. Going into specifics would be pretty fruitless, and hurt the film when you actually see it, so I won't bother. You'll just have to trust me on this one.It's also got a surprising amount of gore, which is generally nicely done. There are quite a few nicely done gunshots, and two particularly stunning headshots. Furthermore, this film doesn't ever let us forget that zombies eat flesh, and there's scene of someone being ripped limb from limb which recalls a number of deaths from Dawn and Day of the Dead simultaneously.  The zombies themselves look quite nice, though they are fairly low-key.Yeah, that's about it.  Definitely a great movie, which certainly must be viewed by any zombie fan.",5,British Zombies,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,4135,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', ""'Shaun"", 'Dead', 'never', 'came', 'local', 'theaters', 'fact', 'was', 'outperforming', 'films', 'showing', 'places', 'even', 'limited', 'release', 'got', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'even', 'longer', 'um', 'yay', 'fate', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'doubt', 'consigned', 'Fortunately', 'proved', 'be', 'more', 'wait', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'fairly', 'ho-hum', 'year', 'As', 'far', 'comedies', 'go', 'think', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'course', ""'m"", 'big', 'horror', 'fan', 'big', 'zombie', 'fan', 'particular', 'pretty', 'much', 'aimed', 'right', 'Still', ""'Shaun"", 'Dead', 'probably', 'lot', 'more', 'general', 'appeal', 'typical', 'Horror-Comedy', 'think', 'should', 'appeal', 'must', 'people', 'who', 'comedies', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'suck.Alright', 'basic', 'setup', 'Shaun', '29', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'kinda', 'aimless', 'going', 'nowhere', 'least', 'partially', 'due', 'bestfriend/roomate', 'Ed', 'who', 'fat', 'immature', 'loser', 'So', 'girlfriend', 'Liz', 'Ed', 'get', 'really', 'drunk', 'where', 'ever', 'film', 'was', 'heading', 'interrupted', 'England', 'then', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'more', 'famous', 'horror-comedy', 'films', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'II', 'Re-Animator', 'Dead-Alive', 'film', 'actually', 'fairly', 'seriously', 'times', 'Particularly', 'end', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'holed', 'together', 'appear', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'doomed', 'start', 'fighting', 'one', 'people', 'have', 'gone', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'more', 'Horror', 'film', 'Comedy', 'massively', 'overstating', 'certainly', 'not', 'purely', 'light-hearted', 'fare', 'Lots', 'people', 'think', 'bad', 'thing', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'when', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'when', 'trying', 'be', 'serious/dramatic/touching', 'always', 'films', 'are', 'willing', 'play', 'tone', 'one', 'best', 'aspects', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'imo', 'also', 'particularly', 'more', 'serious', 'bits', 'abundantly', 'makers', 'film', 'have', 'genuine', 'affection', 'genre', ""'re"", 'parodying.The', 'film', 'level', 'visual', 'flair', 'attention', 'detail', 'are', 'pretty', 'extraordinary', 'comedy', 'quite', 'impressive', 'regardless', 'genre', 'use', 'lots', 'great', 'long', 'steadicam', 'shots', 'fun', 'ultra-kinetic', 'rapid', 'fire', 'editing', 'used', 'comedic', 'rather', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'detail', 'how', 'lots', 'going', 'background', 'how', 'film', 'repeat', 'similar', 'scenarios', 'zombie', 'attack', 'course', 'numerous', 'references', 'other', 'films', ""'re"", 'particularly', 'fond', 'referencing', 'original', 'Living', 'Dead', 'trilogy', 'naturally', 'particular', 'penchant', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'Still', ""n't"", 'rely', 'Horror', 'films', 'alone', 'referencing', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'British', 'tv', 'shows', 'probably', 'lots', 'other', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'also', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'subtle-', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'references', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'original', 'material', 'i.e', 'are', ""n't"", 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'abundantly', 'obvious', 'what', 'someone', 'did/said', 'was', 'reference', 'so', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'least', 'were', ""n't"", 'Reviewing', 'comedies', 'hard', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'funny', 'Very', 'funny', 'smarter', 'average', 'comedy', 'suppose', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'slapstick', 'lowbrow', 'humor', 'Going', 'specifics', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'fruitless', 'hurt', 'film', 'when', 'actually', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'trust', 'one.It', 'also', 'got', 'surprising', 'amount', 'gore', 'generally', 'nicely', 'done', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'nicely', 'done', 'gunshots', 'two', 'particularly', 'stunning', 'headshots', 'Furthermore', 'film', ""n't"", 'ever', 'let', 'forget', 'zombies', 'eat', 'flesh', 'scene', 'someone', 'being', 'ripped', 'limb', 'limb', 'number', 'deaths', 'Dawn', 'Day', 'Dead', 'simultaneously', 'zombies', 'look', 'quite', 'nice', 'are', 'fairly', 'low-key.Yeah', 'Definitely', 'great', 'movie', 'certainly', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'zombie', 'fan']",Shaun of the Dead

841001,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B0002MJT0I,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[0, 0]","In its own way, this film is a minor classic already. It has created a whole new genre; the zombie comedy. Zombies, of course, have always been kind of humorous, with their shuffling, growling, and slowness. Of all the monsters to have to deal with, one gets the feeling that zombies would be the easiest to dispatch. A zany group of Brits, who have all worked together previously on British television, have put together a film that combines the bawdy and the bizarre; a kind of dead-pan English humor meets graphic gore Fest; a kind of Benny Hill meets George Romero in a pub and they hatch a plot.The primary writer was Simon Pegg, who also played Shaun. The script was very clever, full of pathos and pratfalls, and it was as much a social commentary as it was comedic. There is a depiction of the English Everyman that is leaden-eyed, drooling dumbly, a populous slogging through their gray lives barely breathing; vacuous, desensitized, barely breathing. They are slaves to their daily routines, lurching home after working at a job they detested to their identical row houses. It took people a while to even notice that the undead were walking among them.There was a distinct Thames TV feel to the movie. I half expected Rowen Atkinson, Stephen Fry, or John Cleese to pop in.Pegg, as Shaun, worked in an appliance store. He would shuffle through his boring day, and then race off to the pub at night. On weekends, of course, he would get serious about his drinking. His pub of choice was the Winchester, named after the American rifle and not its British heritage. Shaun's best friend, and primary roommate, was Ed, played by Nick Frost. Ed spent most of his time playing video games, eating junk food, drinking beer, selling the odd weed or drugs, and waiting to meet Shaun at the Winchester. He was uncouth, boorish, and a bit loveable.Kate Ashfield played Liz, Shaun's longtime girlfriend. She wanted to break up with him. She was tired of the same old routines. She wanted to dump him and move on. There was only one complication; a zombie infestation. Bill Nighy played Phillip, Shaun's stepfather, and Penelope Wilson played Shaun's ""Mum"". They were quite effective, and almost stole every scene they were in. Nighy is a great character actor, and he did especially well.There were several poignant scenes mixed in with the comic mayhem. Pegg played the scenes emotionally bang on. He is a fine actor. Wisely, he never played Shaun as a caricature. Shaun, as a character, could have stepped off the pages of a Harold Pinter or a Tom Stoppard script. Shockingly, mixed in with the comic elements of killing zombies with cricket bats and gold clubs, many of the scenes of gore were quite graphic; equal to the zombie thrills in Danny Boyle's 28 DAYS LATER. In a way, this film was made as an answer to that film. Initially, the zombies were less a threat than an inconvenience, and interference in the drinking bouts. Forting up at the Winchester was absurd, but it was the only ""logical"" choice Shaun and Ed could come up with.I liked this film. After all, how many zombie films quote Bertrand Russell? I think it will be a candidate for cult status.",4,Mirth of the Undead,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,3162,"['own', 'way', 'film', 'minor', 'classic', 'already', 'created', 'whole', 'new', 'genre', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'Zombies', 'course', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'kind', 'humorous', 'shuffling', 'growling', 'slowness', 'monsters', 'have', 'deal', 'one', 'feeling', 'zombies', 'would', 'be', 'easiest', 'dispatch', 'zany', 'group', 'Brits', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'together', 'previously', 'British', 'television', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'bawdy', 'bizarre', 'kind', 'dead-pan', 'English', 'humor', 'meets', 'graphic', 'gore', 'Fest', 'kind', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'George', 'Romero', 'pub', 'hatch', 'plot.The', 'primary', 'writer', 'was', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'Shaun', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'full', 'pathos', 'pratfalls', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'social', 'commentary', 'was', 'comedic', 'depiction', 'English', 'Everyman', 'leaden-eyed', 'drooling', 'dumbly', 'populous', 'slogging', 'gray', 'lives', 'barely', 'breathing', 'vacuous', 'desensitized', 'barely', 'breathing', 'are', 'slaves', 'daily', 'routines', 'lurching', 'home', 'working', 'job', 'detested', 'identical', 'row', 'houses', 'took', 'people', 'while', 'even', 'notice', 'undead', 'were', 'walking', 'was', 'distinct', 'Thames', 'TV', 'feel', 'movie', 'half', 'expected', 'Rowen', 'Atkinson', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'John', 'Cleese', 'pop', 'in.Pegg', 'Shaun', 'worked', 'appliance', 'store', 'would', 'shuffle', 'boring', 'day', 'then', 'race', 'pub', 'night', 'weekends', 'course', 'would', 'get', 'serious', 'drinking', 'pub', 'choice', 'was', 'Winchester', 'named', 'American', 'rifle', 'not', 'British', 'heritage', 'Shaun', 'best', 'friend', 'primary', 'roommate', 'was', 'Ed', 'played', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'Ed', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'eating', 'junk', 'food', 'drinking', 'beer', 'selling', 'odd', 'weed', 'drugs', 'waiting', 'meet', 'Shaun', 'Winchester', 'was', 'uncouth', 'boorish', 'bit', 'loveable.Kate', 'Ashfield', 'played', 'Liz', 'Shaun', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'wanted', 'break', 'up', 'was', 'tired', 'same', 'old', 'routines', 'wanted', 'dump', 'move', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'complication', 'zombie', 'infestation', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'played', 'Phillip', 'Shaun', 'stepfather', 'Penelope', 'Wilson', 'played', 'Shaun', 'Mum', 'were', 'quite', 'effective', 'almost', 'stole', 'scene', 'were', 'Nighy', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'did', 'especially', 'well.There', 'were', 'several', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'mixed', 'comic', 'mayhem', 'Pegg', 'played', 'scenes', 'emotionally', 'bang', 'fine', 'actor', 'Wisely', 'never', 'played', 'Shaun', 'caricature', 'Shaun', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'stepped', 'off', 'pages', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'Tom', 'Stoppard', 'script', 'Shockingly', 'mixed', 'comic', 'elements', 'killing', 'zombies', 'cricket', 'bats', 'gold', 'clubs', 'many', 'scenes', 'gore', 'were', 'quite', 'graphic', 'equal', 'zombie', 'Danny', 'Boyle', '28', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'answer', 'film', 'Initially', 'zombies', 'were', 'less', 'threat', 'inconvenience', 'interference', 'drinking', 'bouts', 'Forting', 'up', 'Winchester', 'was', 'absurd', 'was', 'only', 'logical', 'choice', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'with.I', 'liked', 'film', 'how', 'many', 'zombie', 'films', 'quote', 'Bertrand', 'Russell', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'candidate', 'cult', 'status']",Shaun of the Dead

Calling it a Parody just doesn't sound right because it doesn't really poke fun at zombie films like Spaceballs pokes fun at Star Wars.  It's more like Lucio Fulci's unintentional sequel Zombi 2.

It pays great homage and respect to the classic Zombie film(s) of Romero, down to the socio-culture symbolism, and puts a fresh twist on things by succeeding as a dark comedy.  It's one of those movies where you wonder why this hasn't been done already? Even if you are only casually familiar with the term Zombie or Zombie lore, this movie film puts Hollywood creations such as ""Scream"" to shame.  The British makers of this film know their Zombie lore and manage to tie-in logic, emotional empathy and relatability, that's believeable and endearing, often as a result of the light-hearted comedy and likeable protaganists.*Spoiler Alert*It was refreshing to see logical wrap ups with characters (why was Shaun's mom not more upset about her husband of 17 years dying and going Zombie? Well because she was bitten also and hid it from Shaun and everyone else until her end, and had already accepted her and her husband's fate, but wanted to appear normal for the survival of her son - yes! Brilliant!).And of course the subtle but quite effective behavioral parallels that humans are living zombies in many ways, is perfect and blends right in with the dark humor and tone of the entire film.",5,Lives up to the hype,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,1299,"['What', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', '450+', 'reviews', 'here', 'should', 'tell', 'how', 'popular/good', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'homage', 'respect', 'classic', 'Zombie', 'film', 'Romero', 'down', 'socio-culture', 'symbolism', 'fresh', 'twist', 'things', 'succeeding', 'dark', 'comedy', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'wonder', 'why', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'already', 'Even', 'are', 'only', 'casually', 'familiar', 'term', 'Zombie', 'Zombie', 'lore', 'movie', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'creations', 'such', 'Scream', 'shame', 'British', 'makers', 'film', 'know', 'Zombie', 'lore', 'manage', 'tie-in', 'logic', 'emotional', 'empathy', 'relatability', 'believeable', 'endearing', 'often', 'result', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'likeable', 'protaganists', '*Spoiler', 'Alert*It', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'logical', 'wrap', 'ups', 'characters', 'why', 'was', 'Shaun', 'mom', 'not', 'more', 'upset', 'husband', '17', 'years', 'dying', 'going', 'Zombie', 'Well', 'was', 'bitten', 'also', 'hid', 'Shaun', 'everyone', 'else', 'end', 'had', 'already', 'accepted', 'husband', 'fate', 'wanted', 'appear', 'normal', 'survival', 'son', 'yes', 'Brilliant', '.And', 'course', 'subtle', 'quite', 'effective', 'behavioral', 'parallels', 'humans', 'are', 'living', 'zombies', 'many', 'ways', 'perfect', 'blends', 'right', 'dark', 'humor', 'tone', 'entire', 'film']",Shaun of the Dead

841019,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0002MJT0I,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","When the zombie apocalypse arrives, a hero will rise... from his sofa. When a horror maven as exalted as George Romero goes gaga over this film, even the most die-hard skeptic must recognize SHAUN OF THE DEAD for the wildly entertaining jolt of British cinema that it is. SHAUN OF THE DEAD isn't really a trend-setter. It may have opened the door for ZOMBIELAND, but there already were spoofy zombie flicks floating around before SHAUN OF THE DEAD (BRAINDEAD or the EVIL DEAD films, anyone?). SHAUN OF THE DEAD was brilliant and refreshing enough that it massively raised the profiles of several of the participants, namely Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and their constant director Edgar Wright. This tea-swilling triumvirate rarely, if ever, disappoints.At its heart SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a romantic comedy. The narrative revolves around a fidgety love story between slacker Shaun (Pegg) and his fed-up girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). Except it's a love story that frequently gets undercut not only by the walking dead but also by Shaun's unflagging bromance with his even bigger loser and lived-in best friend Ed (Frost). Shaun, a sad sack sales advisor at some department store, has habitually let everyone down (except, I guess, Ed). He neglects his mum. He persistently breaks promises made to his girlfriend. You cannot blame her for dumping him. Which then leads us to Shaun's short term to-do list: go visit mum (bring flowers); win back Liz; sort out life; bash in ravening undead (don't forget flowers for mum).It's a smart, gleeful, and absolutely inspired send-up of zombie horror, and at the end of the day I was surprised by how much heart it had. I think highly enough of SHAUN OF THE DEAD that, off the top of my head, I'm coming up with only four other zombie films to rank above it: Romero's original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD and Raimi's EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS. Director Edgar Wright masterfully marries the gory, ghoulish scares with the clever and genuinely funny bits. This is one of those times in which the kinetic quick edits amplify the tension. There are frequent legitimately spooky moments that'll make you jump. Still, it's the goofy sequences that plant themselves in your memory, whether it's the record-hurling sequence or the survivors' pretend zombie walk or any of those moments early on in which Shaun is just oblivious of all those ominous signs that indicate an impending zombie uprising. There are heaps of amusing foreshadowing. SHAUN OF THE DEAD is simply so well made, so well structured and terrifically paced. Pegg and Frost are perfection, with Pegg readily building on his lead actor creds. There is surprising weight and credibility to Simon Pegg. It's a star-making role. And what of their constant director Edgar Wright? Well, I am now hugely anticipating the ANT-MAN movie. That's how much stock I place in that reedy-voiced guy.The DVD's hefty bonus bits:- 2 Audio Commentaries, one with Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, the other with Pegg, Frost, Kate Ashfield, Dylan Moran (""David""), and Lucy Davis (""Dianne"")- Simon Pegg's Video Diary (00:06:45 minutes long)- Casting Tapes with Pegg and Frost, Peter Serafinowicz (""Pete""), Kate Ashfield, Dylan Moran, Lucy Davis (totaling 00:04:11 minutes)- Edgar and Simon's Flip Chart - Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg give an overview of the movie plot via flip chart (00:13:37 minutes)- Zombie Make-up Tests (00:02:21)- Special Effects Comparison: composite shots of the zombie girl impaled on a pole and Pete's bullet thru the eye (00:02:24)- Behind-the-Scenes Press Kit Featurette (00:07:10)- ""Funky Pete"" - Quote: ""Contractually, the makers have to provide a 'clean' version of the film for usage on some airlines and TV stations.

Some fun with that as, in this sequence, Shaun's flatmate Pete's naughty f-bombs are replaced with the word ""funk"" (00:02:12)- ""The Man Who Would Be Shaun"" - a quick outtake between Pegg and Frost (00:00:36)- ""Plot Holes"" - What happened to Shaun when he ran off?

It tries to be a ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock"" & ""Two Smoking Barrels"" of the Zombie sub-genre, but falls short of those films. It obviously takes cues from ""Return of the Living Dead"" & ""Dead Alive,"" but falls short of those films too, or for that matter, falls short of the brilliant comedic take on Zombies in ""Fido,"" 2006, which is a later film, but much more entertaining , as is ""Dog House,"" which is a much more comedic take on the Zombie sub-genre. That is not to say ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a bad movie by any means, just not a GREAT movie.

Shaun of the Dead continues a steady trend of high quality, small budget British films over the last few years (as I've really enjoyed About a Boy, Maybe Baby, and Love Actually). This film is not a horror film at heart, but a romantic comedy. The film never looses focus of the characters and despite the many zombies, the characters never loose focus of their personal problems. In a way the movie mirrors our world and the way people adapt to their environments. Despite the mounting conflicts and wars worldwide, we as individuals as a whole are still mired in our small personal dramas, weather it be romantic, work related, or little squabbles.There are scenes that get very intense but the film makers also follow the intensity up with great comedy. Shaun of the Dead is hands down the funniest movie of the year. I laughed out loud multiple times. The laughs are generated mostly by the lead characters, not the zombie's which lends a unique feel to the film.It's a shame this movie didn't find a wider audience in the theaters.

But not insanely ludicrous enough to make it a classic humor. Decidedly split between honoring the Romero movies of the past, and then letting out some college humor that must have followed the creators since the ol' days when they first watched Night of the living dead. I got the feeling that the target audience was English as well, I found it apalling how shaun cried for his ""mummy"" near the end. Dripping with zombie blood and witnessing her untimely death. I felt that the timing of the movie was a shame also. People may just be sick of zombie movies. There were so many in just the past year. It's hollywood up to it's usual self, stuck on overtaxing an idea. Keep this movie in mind, and in eight years, give it another try.

841044,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0002MJT0I,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 5]","I finally got a chance to see this movie, and I LOVED it!! It is so funny and gross at the same time. Many viewers have seen ""Dawn of the Dead"" (old and new), ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Day of the Dead,"" ""Resident Evil"" flicks and any other number of zombie films, right? So when you hear the term ""funny"" associated with ""zombie"" you think, ""Oh, it's a spoof."" Quite the opposite is true of ""Shaun of the Dead.""In here we have Shaun who's a disenfranchised Peter Pan, idling away the last moments of his twenties living with roommates, hanging out at his local pub, and working a menial retail job. He and his friends don't seem to notice the ever-growing army of reanimated flesh-eaters, instead being absorbed in their interpersonal relationships and romances. Only when circumstances grow dire and demand action do they reluctantly formulate a plan. The casting was well put together and you will absolutely love Shaun and his pal Ed.There is much to admire about this film. I will say towards the ending it does gets a bit clich&eacute;d and over serious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. ""Shaun"" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. One funny detail is that since in the U.K., guns are pretty much nonexistent. So beat off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. Second it doesn't waste our time with explanations - it knows that the audience is all ready familiar with the conventions of the genre. The gimmick of this film is that it feels as if filmmakers picked an extra in ""Dawn of the Dead"" and decided to tell his story.Zombie films are some of my favorite horror movies and I am grateful that they have made a comeback in recent years.

841045,A1IBSQQHGCDUAN,B0002MJT0I,"Jeremy Ulrey ""Bangyrmfhead""","[2, 2]","While ""Shaun of the Dead"" wasn't as drop-dead funny as I'd hoped it would be, in the end it amounted to much more than the dogpile of semi-related gags my preconceptions would have necessarily entailed it to be. The movie starts off a bit slow, the laughs early on coming few and far between for the first half hour, but in hindsight this is all legitimate character development. When I say that the film turned out to be something more than it promised to be, what I mean is exactly this: whereas most filmmakers would have focused on the slapstick possibilities inherent in a world full of slow moving, incompetent zombies, ""Shaun of the Dead"" instead treats this as a mere backdrop to illustrate the quest for one man's redemption. Shaun is a man who, through a combination of moral sluggishness and a willingness to be walked on by those more assertive than he, finds himself entirely behind the eightball in life at nearly every turn. The first scene in the film shows Shaun already on thin ice with his girlfriend. To the viewer, it becomes obvious that Shaun's boorishness comes from a fear of going outside the box of his everyday routine, and why should he when even in the course of this routine things never fail to go wrong? But his girlfriend doesn't quite see it this way, and whatever sympathy she may have for Shaun is rapidly eroding away under a veneer of strained patience. To placate her, Shaun cooks up a romantic evening at an upscale restaurant to celebrate their anniversary, then conveniently forgets to call in the reservation until the day of the gig, at which point, of course, the question of a table is decidedly OUT of the question.It's against these events that the zombies first begin to make their appearance, at first as individuals who are easily mistaken for drunks and the homeless by the hapless Shaun and his roommate. The zombies begin to gradually increase in number until a fateful encounter in the back garden convinces Shaun of their lifelessness, at which point the movie becoms a rescue mission to salvage his mom and his (now ex-)girlfriend. There are a number of other auxiliary characters, most of which are fleshed out quite well considering most horror flicks would relegate them as faceless flesh-bait for the antagonists. To say too much more would be to lessen the effect of some of the key plot twists, although to be honest most of these twists will be familiar to fans of previous zombie films. But the film isn't to be noted for it's plot, but for the way it handles it's characters, particularly Shaun, who is shaken out of his cocoon of inaction by the even greater incompetence of his friends and family. Once survival itself is at stake and things are no longer just a matter of comfort and convenience, Shaun finds a resolve inside himself that he likely didn't know he had (his entourage certainly seems surprised). And yet the movie never descends into an over-the-top Rambo cliche, like the American version surely must when Hollywood inevitably gets around to remaking ""Shaun of the Dead"", and it's the small scale of the human drama that makes it that much more realistic, and hence more effective.",4,Effective blend of horror and comedy,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,3167,"['Shaun', 'Dead', 'was', ""n't"", 'drop-dead', 'funny', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'amounted', 'much', 'more', 'dogpile', 'semi-related', 'gags', 'preconceptions', 'would', 'have', 'necessarily', 'entailed', 'be', 'movie', 'bit', 'slow', 'laughs', 'early', 'coming', 'few', 'far', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'hindsight', 'legitimate', 'character', 'development', 'When', 'say', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'promised', 'be', 'what', 'mean', 'exactly', 'whereas', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'focused', 'slapstick', 'possibilities', 'inherent', 'world', 'full', 'slow', 'moving', 'incompetent', 'zombies', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'instead', 'mere', 'backdrop', 'illustrate', 'quest', 'one', 'man', 'redemption', 'Shaun', 'man', 'who', 'combination', 'moral', 'sluggishness', 'willingness', 'be', 'walked', 'more', 'assertive', 'entirely', 'eightball', 'life', 'nearly', 'turn', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'Shaun', 'already', 'thin', 'ice', 'girlfriend', 'viewer', 'obvious', 'Shaun', 'boorishness', 'fear', 'going', 'box', 'everyday', 'routine', 'why', 'should', 'when', 'even', 'course', 'routine', 'things', 'never', 'fail', 'go', 'wrong', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'way', 'sympathy', 'may', 'have', 'Shaun', 'rapidly', 'eroding', 'away', 'veneer', 'strained', 'patience', 'placate', 'Shaun', 'up', 'romantic', 'evening', 'upscale', 'restaurant', 'celebrate', 'anniversary', 'then', 'conveniently', 'call', 'reservation', 'day', 'gig', 'point', 'course', 'question', 'table', 'decidedly', 'OUT', 'question.It', 'events', 'zombies', 'first', 'begin', 'make', 'appearance', 'first', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'mistaken', 'drunks', 'homeless', 'hapless', 'Shaun', 'roommate', 'zombies', 'begin', 'gradually', 'increase', 'number', 'fateful', 'encounter', 'back', 'garden', 'convinces', 'Shaun', 'lifelessness', 'point', 'movie', 'rescue', 'mission', 'salvage', 'mom', 'now', 'ex-', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'auxiliary', 'characters', 'most', 'are', 'fleshed', 'quite', 'well', 'considering', 'most', 'horror', 'flicks', 'would', 'relegate', 'faceless', 'flesh-bait', 'antagonists', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'lessen', 'effect', 'key', 'plot', 'twists', 'be', 'honest', 'most', 'twists', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'fans', 'previous', 'zombie', 'films', 'film', ""n't"", 'be', 'noted', 'plot', 'way', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Shaun', 'who', 'shaken', 'cocoon', 'inaction', 'even', 'greater', 'incompetence', 'friends', 'family', 'Once', 'survival', 'stake', 'things', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'just', 'matter', 'comfort', 'convenience', 'Shaun', 'resolve', 'inside', 'likely', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'entourage', 'certainly', 'surprised', 'yet', 'movie', 'never', 'over-the-top', 'Rambo', 'cliche', 'American', 'version', 'surely', 'must', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'inevitably', 'remaking', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'small', 'scale', 'human', 'drama', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'hence', 'more', 'effective']",Shaun of the Dead

It's stylish with great one-liners and good comic acting. It does manage to even be scary at times. It makes fun of other zombie movies while being one itself. However it's still a much better zombie movie than any of the Resident Evil movies. The violence can even make you cringe at times. It does have times when it takes itself serious and where it can even be touching as well.  It makes for a good movie to watch with buddies and some beers. Can even watch it with your g/f too since there's some romance in there.

841061,APRU373UYVK2Y,B0002MJT0I,J. N. Mohlman,"[2, 3]","You're twenty-something, at the crossroad in your life, maybe you hate your job or your relationship is in trouble...we've all been there.  But things don't really get grim until you throw the end of the world into the mix.  Which is exactly what happens to the eponymous Shaun of ""Shaun of the Dead"".  Every day is the same and his life is going nowhere, which is precisely what has gotten him dumped.  His college era friendships are looking a little long on the tooth, and he has no career to speak of.  Fortunately, a zombie plague is giving him the opportunity to show his true mettle.What is perhaps most engaging about this film is that while it is a parody, with numerous flat out hilarious moments, it is also offers up some genuine thrills, a bit of romance and a surprisingly realistic portrayal of the strains and emotion of an end of the world type scenario.  The film begins simply enough with Shaun reeling through life, largely detached from the surrounding world.  Until one day his routine falls rather alarmingly apart when the urban zombies he encounters turn out to be actual zombies.As Shaun and his ne'er do well pal Ed set out to rescue his mother and his girlfriend the directors do a nice job of whipsawing from parody to drama to horror and back again.  While ""Shaun of the Dead"" is first and foremost a comedy, it offers some surprisingly poignant moments, including Shaun's reconciliation with his badly mauled stepfather.  Of course, it offers the best fight sequence set to Queen since ""Highlander""; although this one doesn't involve swords, so don't take things to seriously.What lends to the comedy, and also to the interesting dynamic, is that the cast is made up exclusively of normal people.  No cops, not even any security guards; no one with martial arts training, etc.  When Shaun's band finally gets their hands on a gun, none of them can hit a thing with it.  Moreover, they fight and backbite, and while Shaun does rise to the occasion, he is far from infallible.The most interesting aspect of these relationships is that between Shaun and his recently ex-girlfriend Liz.  She dumps him because he was doing nothing with his life, but now that he's making a go of it, the circumstances hardly seem right.  The directors insert their give and take in to the flow of the action perfectly; their interaction is never out of context or over the top.  A such, it has more in common with old time Hollywood romances that it does with the over the top grope-fests one expects today, and the result is a certain sweetness that nicely offsets the rather grim setting.Offering laugh out loud moments, a few nice chills and some really interesting social commentary, ""Shaun of the Dead"" was a surprisingly complex movie.  While it nicely lampoons just about every zombie film you've ever seen, it is hardly derivative.  Those who enjoyed Max Brooks' book ""The Zombie Survival Guide"" will particularly appreciate the film as much of the comedy is the subtle, tongue in cheek satire the British do so well.  That said, don't rule ""Shaun of the Dead"" out just because you're not a fan of the genre; it's one of the more unique films you're ever likely to see and a real treat.Jake Mohlman",5,A zombie apocalypse as the path to personal growth,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,3216,"[""'re"", 'twenty-something', 'crossroad', 'life', 'maybe', 'hate', 'job', 'relationship', 'trouble', ""'ve"", 'been', 'there', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'grim', 'throw', 'end', 'world', 'mix', 'Which', 'exactly', 'what', 'eponymous', 'Shaun', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'day', 'same', 'life', 'going', 'nowhere', 'precisely', 'what', 'gotten', 'dumped', 'college', 'era', 'friendships', 'are', 'looking', 'little', 'long', 'tooth', 'career', 'speak', 'Fortunately', 'zombie', 'plague', 'giving', 'opportunity', 'show', 'true', 'mettle.What', 'perhaps', 'most', 'engaging', 'film', 'parody', 'numerous', 'flat', 'out', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'also', 'up', 'genuine', 'thrills', 'bit', 'romance', 'surprisingly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'strains', 'emotion', 'end', 'world', 'type', 'scenario', 'film', 'simply', 'enough', 'Shaun', 'reeling', 'life', 'largely', 'detached', 'surrounding', 'world', 'one', 'day', 'routine', 'rather', 'alarmingly', 'apart', 'when', 'urban', 'zombies', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'actual', 'zombies.As', 'Shaun', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'pal', 'Ed', 'set', 'out', 'rescue', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'directors', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'whipsawing', 'parody', 'drama', 'horror', 'back', 'again', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'first', 'foremost', 'comedy', 'surprisingly', 'poignant', 'moments', 'including', 'Shaun', 'reconciliation', 'badly', 'mauled', 'stepfather', 'course', 'best', 'fight', 'sequence', 'set', 'Queen', 'Highlander', 'one', ""n't"", 'involve', 'swords', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'things', 'seriously.What', 'lends', 'comedy', 'also', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'cast', 'made', 'up', 'exclusively', 'normal', 'people', 'cops', 'not', 'even', 'security', 'guards', 'one', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'etc', 'When', 'Shaun', 'band', 'finally', 'hands', 'gun', 'none', 'can', 'hit', 'thing', 'Moreover', 'fight', 'backbite', 'Shaun', 'rise', 'occasion', 'far', 'infallible.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'relationships', 'Shaun', 'recently', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Liz', 'dumps', 'was', 'doing', 'nothing', 'life', 'now', 'making', 'go', 'circumstances', 'hardly', 'seem', 'right', 'directors', 'insert', 'give', 'take', 'flow', 'action', 'perfectly', 'interaction', 'never', 'context', 'top', 'such', 'more', 'common', 'old', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'romances', 'top', 'grope-fests', 'one', 'today', 'result', 'certain', 'sweetness', 'nicely', 'rather', 'grim', 'setting.Offering', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'few', 'nice', 'chills', 'really', 'interesting', 'social', 'commentary', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'movie', 'nicely', 'just', 'about', 'zombie', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hardly', 'derivative', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Max', 'Brooks', 'book', 'Zombie', 'Survival', 'Guide', 'will', 'particularly', 'appreciate', 'film', 'much', 'comedy', 'subtle', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'satire', 'British', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'rule', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'out', 'just', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'genre', 'one', 'more', 'unique', 'films', ""'re"", 'ever', 'likely', 'see', 'real', 'treat.Jake', 'Mohlman']",Shaun of the Dead

841063,AIWRBCDSPCDRE,B0002MJT0I,"John Adams ""Farley Flavors""","[0, 0]","It saddens me when The horror genre is excluded from all the award ceremonies. Granted a really good one is fewand far between but ""Shaun of the Dead"" to me screams at least golden globe noms for best actor and best picture in comedy. One thing I can definitely vouch is that there haven't been that many worthwhile comedies in 2004 to begin with. Well I can truly say that Shaun of the Dead is the real deal when it comes to a solid comedy, and also a solid horror flick to boot.It's well known that a truly great comedy can blend different genres of comedy. ""Shaun"" combines verbal wit, with physical comedy, and also satire. Additionally written with an understanding of the minutiae of the zombie genre. For me, the funniest running gag is how the characters shirk to call zombies, well... Zombies, simply because it sounds ridiculous. It's funny because when you look back at every great zombie movie they never call them zombies. The always call them ""Undead"" or ""creatures."" another bit of satire which is truly inspired is the opening credits which brilliantly mocks how there have been zombies, long before there are zombies (if you catch my drift.)To call ""Shaun of the Dead"" a spoof, would actually be a misnomer, because a spoof relies strictly on the comedy and nothing more. ""Shaun of the Dead"" on the other hand is part of a small (but notorious) breed of horror known simply as comedy / horror. Other notable titles in this genre are Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead Trilogy,"" Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive,"" and Don Coscarelli's ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" The difference between this and a spoof if that a horror/comedy actually has potent moments of horror which have the power to jolt the audience. And Those traits are ever present in ""Shaun of the Dead.""The standard issue horror jolts are perfectly placed and imaginative. Meanwhile all the scenes where the zombies attack in full force actually invoke a lack of comfort that comes from being surrounded by things that want to kill you.Not to mention since this takes place in Britan and the posession of firearms is looked down upon over there, it's thoroughly enjoyable to see how our heroes cope, starting by throwing small items, then onto a brilliantly hysterical sequence where they're bickering over which records to launch and the intruding zombies.""Purple Rain?"" ""No"" ""Batman soundtrack"" ""throw it!""Another success of ""Shaun of the Dead"" is it's characters. All the characters, including the ones you're supposed to hate are appealing and extremely well written. Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, flawlessly plays the everyman thrown into the macabre situation, but what affects me more about his performance was how Pegg conveys the emotional roller coaster Shaun goes on, as he copes with trying to keep his friends and family alive and simultaneously winning back his girlfriend. Next to him Nick Frost's Ed, is rude, disgusting, moronic and lazy... but that's why we love him. Ed, represents the lovable lug that we all know and have befriended sometime in our life. And it's not because he's practical. It's because he's the kind of guy we want to be round so we ourselves don't have to be. And in the finale of the film you fnd yourself deeply affected by the bond between Shaun and Ed. The love interest, Liz, gamely played by Kate Ashfield Makes for a fantastic horror heroine, and makes it easy for us to understand why Shaun is so wounded when Liz dumps him in the beginning. She also lends a lot to Shaun's development through the course of the film, while at the same time sustaining her memorability.I could continue ranting about the cast but it would take a while. Just take my word that every cast member gives it their personal 100% which, in recent horror movies, isn't often.In closing, it essential to repeat my praise for utter brillance of the cohesive mix of gruesome zombie horror, and hysterical British humor. It takes skilled talent to properly balance those elements, through the brilliance of Simon Pegg, and Edgar Wright's Writing, the balance is achieved effortlessly.

841066,ACTG0NWGJMNSM,B0002MJT0I,"John Larsen ""Johncritic""","[1, 1]","It's not that flat-mates Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are clueless. They are. You just can't blame them for not noticing their neighborhood has been overrun with zombies. As Shaun of the Dead begins, it's difficult to tell the living from the living dead. We watch as people trudge through their everyday lives, so systematically beaten down they look and walk like zombies.Irreverent, sly, and affectionately connected to its source material, Shaun of the Dead is a love story with bite. The gory story is grounded by a good natured sense of humor and a real desire to make a horror film that goes against the grain. Splatter fans will appreciate the rip and shred effects, but at the heart of the film is a love story.Pegg is the perfect anti-hero, a man child who shares a flat with two school chums, one a responsible albeit anal-retentive gatherer and harvester; and Ed, a slob who plays video games all day. Ed gets by doing miscellaneous jobs, while Shaun feels out of place as the senior sales manager at an electronics store. When they're not getting by, they're getting drunk at the Winchester Pub.It's there that Shaun decides to move forward on his relationship with Liz (Kate Ashfield), a woman tired of his empty promises. Their future hangs on an important dinner date that Shaun naturally forgets. Shaun is so distracted over the break-up he doesn't realize the severity of another problem: the city is being overrun with the living dead.Shaun and Ed's clueless behavior is good for several laughs: they mock a zombie on the street, believing he's drunk, and a female zombie who winds up in their backyard. Once Shaun and Ed are up to speed, they become reluctant zombie fighters, roaming the city to save the people they love. That includes Shaun's mother and stepfather, who doesn't believe that a little bite could lead to anything serious.By design, we're not supposed to take any of Shaun of the Dead seriously. Indeed, characters are put in situations of grave danger, but the set-ups and pay-offs are so rich in black humor that we find ourselves engaged in the film's excesses rather than turning away.What elevates the film is its sense of purpose. The filmmakers aren't just content with stocking the story with nameless and faceless zombie happy meals, they give the characters and thus the story a support system that can withstand anything they throw at it. Most horror films attempt to break the ice with nervous laughter, but Shaun of the Dead celebrates its silliness.The film is decidedly British, and American audiences might have difficulty discerning some of the dialects and phraseology. The situations and jokes are universal, especially when the character's survival skills kick in. Shaun and Ed may not be great warriors, but they're great entertainment.Director/co-writer Edgar Wright and star/co-writer Pegg take their cue from the works of Dario Argento and George Romero, and even Danny Boyle's recent 28 Days Later. The references should delight fans of zombie films, who will immediately recognize the homages. The performances are perfectly suited to the misfit nature of the story, with Pegg and Frost the biggest misfits in the bunch.",4,"HEY DUDE, WHERE'S MY GIRLFRIEND?",1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,3193,"['not', 'flat-mates', 'Shaun', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Ed', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'are', 'clueless', 'are', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'not', 'noticing', 'neighborhood', 'been', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'difficult', 'tell', 'living', 'living', 'dead', 'watch', 'people', 'trudge', 'everyday', 'lives', 'so', 'systematically', 'beaten', 'down', 'look', 'walk', 'zombies.Irreverent', 'sly', 'affectionately', 'connected', 'source', 'material', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'love', 'story', 'bite', 'gory', 'story', 'grounded', 'good', 'natured', 'sense', 'humor', 'real', 'desire', 'make', 'horror', 'film', 'grain', 'Splatter', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'rip', 'shred', 'effects', 'heart', 'film', 'love', 'story.Pegg', 'perfect', 'anti-hero', 'man', 'child', 'who', 'shares', 'flat', 'two', 'school', 'chums', 'one', 'responsible', 'anal-retentive', 'gatherer', 'harvester', 'Ed', 'slob', 'who', 'video', 'games', 'day', 'Ed', 'doing', 'miscellaneous', 'jobs', 'Shaun', 'place', 'senior', 'sales', 'manager', 'electronics', 'store', 'When', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', ""'re"", 'getting', 'drunk', 'Winchester', 'Pub.It', 'Shaun', 'move', 'forward', 'relationship', 'Liz', 'Kate', 'Ashfield', 'woman', 'tired', 'empty', 'promises', 'future', 'hangs', 'important', 'dinner', 'date', 'Shaun', 'naturally', 'Shaun', 'so', 'distracted', 'break-up', ""n't"", 'realize', 'severity', 'problem', 'city', 'being', 'overrun', 'living', 'dead.Shaun', 'Ed', 'clueless', 'behavior', 'good', 'several', 'laughs', 'mock', 'zombie', 'street', 'believing', 'drunk', 'female', 'zombie', 'who', 'up', 'backyard', 'Once', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'are', 'up', 'speed', 'become', 'reluctant', 'zombie', 'fighters', 'roaming', 'city', 'save', 'people', 'love', 'Shaun', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'little', 'bite', 'could', 'lead', 'anything', 'serious.By', 'design', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'take', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'seriously', 'Indeed', 'characters', 'are', 'put', 'situations', 'grave', 'danger', 'set-ups', 'pay-offs', 'are', 'so', 'rich', 'black', 'humor', 'find', 'engaged', 'film', 'excesses', 'rather', 'turning', 'film', 'sense', 'purpose', 'filmmakers', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'content', 'stocking', 'story', 'nameless', 'faceless', 'zombie', 'happy', 'meals', 'give', 'characters', 'thus', 'story', 'support', 'system', 'can', 'withstand', 'anything', 'throw', 'Most', 'horror', 'films', 'attempt', 'break', 'ice', 'nervous', 'laughter', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'silliness.The', 'film', 'decidedly', 'British', 'American', 'audiences', 'might', 'have', 'difficulty', 'discerning', 'dialects', 'phraseology', 'situations', 'jokes', 'are', 'universal', 'especially', 'when', 'character', 'survival', 'skills', 'kick', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'warriors', ""'re"", 'great', 'entertainment.Director/co-writer', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'star/co-writer', 'Pegg', 'take', 'cue', 'works', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'George', 'Romero', 'even', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'recent', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'references', 'should', 'delight', 'fans', 'zombie', 'films', 'who', 'will', 'immediately', 'recognize', 'homages', 'performances', 'are', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'misfit', 'nature', 'story', 'Pegg', 'Frost', 'biggest', 'misfits', 'bunch']",Shaun of the Dead

841070,A2B9WOSXCU7LDM,B0002MJT0I,"Jordan ""brainofj72""","[9, 10]","The recent surge of horror remakes has been replete with glossy, flashy movies full of generic scores mixed with meaningless nu-metal music, unoriginal storylines, carnage suitable only for cookie-cutter teen audiences, and the problem of taking themselves all too seriously. What's happened to the inventive, darkly funny horror films of yester-year, such as ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Dead Alive""? Hollywood has all but forgotten what once made horror films great, but it seems that the UK is out to remind them. First with ""28 Days Later"", a film that put a new spin on the zombie genre, and now with ""Shaun of the Dead"", a hilarious romantic zombie comedy, or ""rom-zom-com"".""Shaun of the Dead"" is about, well, Shaun (Pegg), a man who is at a crossroads in his life. He works a dead-end job, he lives with his slob of a best friend, Ed (Frost), and he was just dumped by his girlfriend of three years, Liz (Ashfield). In the midst of trying to sort all of this out, a zombie epidemic just happens to break out, and this only ""exacerbates"" things for him.Right from the first frame, we get the feeling that this is a thoroughly complete horror comedy, as right away it features The Goblins' score for the original ""Dawn of the Dead"". The references to classic horror films and filmmakers just flow and flow constantly, as the film gives a nod to everything from Romero's ""Dead"" series (obviously) to ""The Evil Dead"" to Lucio Fulci. The way the film approaches the zombie invasion is extremely clever and well-handled, featuring several brilliant sequences, one of which shows Shaun routinely walking the streets of London on a perfectly average morning and then walking them again on the morning of the undead, or, dare I say it, the ""dawn of the dead"" (insert eye-roll here), without even noticing the difference. But what really makes the film outstanding is not just the horror element, but the fact that this would be a hysterical and wonderful film even without the zombie twist. The acting is excellent, especially from Simon Pegg, who delivers gags with perfect comic timing, pulls off heated confrontations expertly, and even nails the film's demanding emotional scenes (yes, there are demanding emotional scenes).Not only does the film keep the laughs and the inventiveness flowing, but it also delivers what so many of the sleek Hollywood horror remakes of late have been forgetting: gore. It's complete with squirting blood, gushing bites, head-shots, and even a disembowling. Also, the ending, though something of a deus ex machina, is still extremely inventive and is most certainly a crowd pleaser.Edward Wright (co-writer/director) and Simon Pegg (co-writer) have delivered a film that will satisfy the demands of horror purists, romantic comedy fans, and just about every other kind of moviegoer there is (except for maybe the teens that are in love with ""The Grudge"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004)), for it is truly a film that doesn't forget any of the elements of a great horror movie, comedy, or drama.9/10",5,"A Brilliant ""Rom-Zom-Com""",1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,3021,"['recent', 'surge', 'horror', 'remakes', 'been', 'replete', 'glossy', 'flashy', 'movies', 'full', 'generic', 'scores', 'mixed', 'meaningless', 'nu-metal', 'music', 'unoriginal', 'storylines', 'carnage', 'suitable', 'only', 'cookie-cutter', 'teen', 'audiences', 'problem', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'What', 'happened', 'inventive', 'darkly', 'funny', 'horror', 'films', 'yester-year', 'such', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'Hollywood', 'forgotten', 'what', 'once', 'made', 'horror', 'films', 'great', 'UK', 'out', 'remind', 'First', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'film', 'put', 'new', 'spin', 'zombie', 'genre', 'now', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'hilarious', 'romantic', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'rom-zom-com', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'about', 'well', 'Shaun', 'Pegg', 'man', 'who', 'crossroads', 'life', 'dead-end', 'job', 'slob', 'best', 'friend', 'Ed', 'Frost', 'was', 'just', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'three', 'years', 'Liz', 'Ashfield', 'midst', 'trying', 'sort', 'out', 'zombie', 'epidemic', 'just', 'break', 'out', 'only', 'exacerbates', 'things', 'him.Right', 'first', 'frame', 'get', 'feeling', 'thoroughly', 'complete', 'horror', 'comedy', 'right', 'Goblins', 'score', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'references', 'classic', 'horror', 'films', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'flow', 'flow', 'constantly', 'film', 'nod', 'everything', 'Romero', 'Dead', 'series', 'obviously', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'way', 'film', 'zombie', 'invasion', 'extremely', 'clever', 'well-handled', 'featuring', 'several', 'brilliant', 'sequences', 'one', 'Shaun', 'routinely', 'walking', 'streets', 'London', 'perfectly', 'average', 'morning', 'then', 'walking', 'again', 'morning', 'undead', 'dare', 'say', 'dawn', 'dead', 'insert', 'eye-roll', 'here', 'even', 'noticing', 'difference', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'outstanding', 'not', 'just', 'horror', 'element', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'hysterical', 'wonderful', 'film', 'even', 'zombie', 'twist', 'acting', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'who', 'gags', 'perfect', 'comic', 'timing', 'off', 'heated', 'confrontations', 'expertly', 'even', 'film', 'demanding', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'yes', 'are', 'demanding', 'emotional', 'scenes', '.Not', 'only', 'film', 'keep', 'laughs', 'inventiveness', 'flowing', 'also', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'sleek', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'remakes', 'late', 'have', 'been', 'forgetting', 'gore', 'complete', 'squirting', 'blood', 'gushing', 'bites', 'head-shots', 'even', 'disembowling', 'Also', 'ending', 'something', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'still', 'extremely', 'inventive', 'most', 'certainly', 'crowd', 'pleaser.Edward', 'Wright', 'co-writer/director', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'co-writer', 'have', 'delivered', 'film', 'will', 'satisfy', 'demands', 'horror', 'purists', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fans', 'just', 'about', 'other', 'kind', 'moviegoer', 'maybe', 'teens', 'are', 'love', 'Grudge', 'Dawn', 'Dead', '2004', 'truly', 'film', ""n't"", 'forget', 'elements', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'comedy', 'drama.9/10']",Shaun of the Dead

Deep down they are a combination of many classical well known/loved genres, & most of all SHOWCASE/celebrate the complexities & empathy of human relationships & it's polar dynamics (eg. Mulder and Scully, Shaun & his mother etc.) Therefore I connected to many of the situations that arose from this great APOCALYPTIC movie. A cinema tip: make sure you watch it in a surround digital sound cinema as all speakers front and back are aggressively, modernly & sophisticatedly used. Really this film is a fantastic & rare mix of comedy, horror & drama that had me laughing out aloud consistently & almost making some in the audience cry. Overall this a surprise hit (I wasn't expecting much from it) containing fantastic special effects (conversely almost beats Hollywood, considering this film's low budget).

He likes his beer, his music, his friends, his girl and his pub.  This is not enough for his girl so she calls it quits.  But while this is going on we see small flashes that all is not right in the world.  The dead are starting to walk and civilization is falling.  Most of this is lost on Shaun and his obnoxious roommate until they find a zombie in their back yard.  After finally paying some attention to the news channels Shaun comes up with a plan.Armed with a cricket bat Shaun is going to rescue his mother, his girl, and hole up in his pub.  Suddenly Shaun is motivated although his old self keeps showing through.I won't tell you were his plan and battles lead as that is part of the fun of this movie.  But remember that this is a zombie flick so there is some gore (one scene in particular).  But unlike the Films of Romero and imitators the zombies are not central, Shaun is.I found the cast to be strong and well chosen.

What's really great about the movie is that it doesn't waste our time with explanations - it knows that the audience is all ready familiar with the conventions of the genre.

841088,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0002MJT0I,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[8, 10]","In the middle of the British contemporary society Shaun (Simon Pegg) works for a small electronic company in order to make enough money for the weekend and rent. Shaun does not have any dreams or expectations on life more than walking down to the Winchester, the local pub, and gulping a pint of beer. This is something that annoys and bores his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), as she gives Shaun one final ultimatum to change his life perspective and do something with his life. This is easier said than done as Shaun quickly realizes when Liz drops him like a bad habit.Troubled Shaun tries to find a way to fix his relationship with Liz, but it is all in vane as she wants nothing to do with him. In the backdrop of Shaun's love issues he misses crucial news, as he usually does, relating human attacks on other humans are taking place where they try to bite or eat each other. Instead Shaun and his best friend, the freeloader Ed (Nick Frost), who spend the days at Shaun's place playing video games, go to the Winchester to drown their sorrows. Simultaneously as London is stricken by an outbreak of zombies, Shaun gets drunk, works on his hangover, and goes to the local convenient store for a soda. Shaun's first contact with the zombies is hilarious as they assume that the person is excessively drunk as the zombie is moaning and stumbling towards them. However, when the two slackers are attacked, the film turns both gory and bloody. This could affect some of the audience as it sometimes is brutal, yet amusing. For example, Shaun and Ed try to kill the zombies with vinyl records by throwing them at their heads while deciding what record to throw and what record to keep.Shaun of the Dead is a horror film that exploits horror with a crude level of comedy as the lazy attitude of Shaun and Ed infects the audience with belly aching humor. The humor is very real as many know and recognize Shaun and Ed in people they know, or in themselves. The love story between Liz and Shaun is also an element that brings further amusement to the audience as it is something to which the audience can relate. The ingredients that surround Shaun spice up the horror with a philosophy, or maybe a lack of, to which most viewers can connect. It is this connection with the audience that enhances the cinematic experience of the film.

Most of the parts were kind of funny, but they weren't that laugh-out-loud kind of funny I was looking for. Two, for being a ""real zombie movie"" it really wasn't that bloody. Either way, a horrific zombie movie or a comic zombie movie, I expect liters upon liters of blood in the movie. There was only one real bloody part towards the end in Shaun of the Dead. And the zombies didn't really remind me of zombies, they reminded me of actors playing zombies. The only thing I liked about the zombies in Shaun of the Dead was that they were slow and decrepit like George Romero orginally made them in Night of the Living Dead and the films that followed.

Sozaeva ""Obsessive bibliophile""","[0, 0]","While Shaun stumbles through his life (and we witness many others stumbling through theirs) in a daze similar to that of the ""undead,"" around him the world is slowly collapsing into horror as zom- oops, I mean, the ""z word"" take over the world.  Satirical and funny, scary and touching, this movie has it all (including a GREAT soundtrack!).  At first Shaun is too focused on his own problems to notice anything else around him - his girlfriend is dissatisfied with their relationship, because all they ever do is go to pub (the Winchester) in the evenings with their respective roommates, and they never do anything together.  Also, he is stuck in a dead-end job where, even when he is put into a position of authority when everyone else calls in, no one treats him with respect.  His mother is the type who refuses to see the bad around her, while his stepfather is just . . . creepy.Using the slow take-over and Shaun's complete unawareness of it as a point of showing how little we tend to pay attention to the world around us, and doing so in a darkly humourous way was a definite hit.  Once Shaun realizes what is happening, he decides what to do and sets out to do it - basing his entire decision on making certain he gets his mother and his girlfriend to some type of safety and not really considering carefully before choosing the pub that perhaps the zombies could break the glass in the windows (of course, the zombies didn't need to, since whats-his-knob, that blue-nosed son-of-a-pumpkin, broke them first).At any rate, I loved it and this movie earns a definite YES YOU MUST SEE IT from me!",5,The line between life and un-life (un-death?) is blurred in this darkly funny British horror comedy,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,1604,"['Shaun', 'life', 'witness', 'many', 'others', 'stumbling', 'theirs', 'daze', 'similar', 'undead', 'world', 'slowly', 'collapsing', 'horror', 'zom-', 'oops', 'mean', 'z', 'word', 'take', 'world', 'Satirical', 'funny', 'scary', 'touching', 'movie', 'including', 'GREAT', 'soundtrack', 'first', 'Shaun', 'too', 'focused', 'own', 'problems', 'notice', 'anything', 'else', 'girlfriend', 'dissatisfied', 'relationship', 'ever', 'do', 'go', 'pub', 'Winchester', 'evenings', 'respective', 'roommates', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'together', 'Also', 'stuck', 'dead-end', 'job', 'where', 'even', 'when', 'put', 'position', 'authority', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'one', 'respect', 'mother', 'type', 'who', 'see', 'bad', 'stepfather', 'just', 'creepy.Using', 'slow', 'take-over', 'Shaun', 'complete', 'unawareness', 'point', 'showing', 'how', 'little', 'tend', 'pay', 'attention', 'world', 'doing', 'so', 'darkly', 'humourous', 'way', 'was', 'definite', 'hit', 'Once', 'Shaun', 'realizes', 'what', 'happening', 'what', 'do', 'sets', 'out', 'do', 'basing', 'entire', 'decision', 'making', 'certain', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'type', 'safety', 'not', 'really', 'considering', 'carefully', 'choosing', 'pub', 'perhaps', 'zombies', 'could', 'break', 'glass', 'windows', 'course', 'zombies', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'whats-his-knob', 'blue-nosed', 'son-of-a-pumpkin', 'broke', 'first', 'rate', 'loved', 'movie', 'definite', 'YES', 'YOU', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'IT']",Shaun of the Dead
841099,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B0002MJT0I,K.T. May,"[0, 0]","If you've never been a fan of British comedy, this movie is excellent to ease you in.  This is nothing like the Monty Python or the Are You Being Served? humor with which you may be familiar.  Shaun of the Dead is American humor with a British accent.  It is also a love story that happens to involve zombies.Shaun (Simon Pegg) is riddled with guilt after his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) finally has enough of his juvenile ways and dumps him.  Shaun's friend and roommate Ed (Nick Frost) tries to console him at the local pub (the Winchester) where they spend all of their free time.  Simultaneously, a zombie invasion is occurring.  Shaun vows to win Liz back, but her two friends Dianne (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran) are trying to keep her away from Shaun with good intentions.Shaun works a retail job, lives a lazy bachelor's life and thinks an idea of a good time is going to the Winchester every night.  It is understandable why Dianne and David would want better for Liz.  Soon the gang realizes that their town that has been taken over by zombies, and Shaun understands that he needs to grow up and prioritize.  If he needs to save the stepfather he despises, so be it.  If he needs to kill his landlord who will soon turn into a zombie, so be it.  He never liked him much anyway.This film can be violent at times, but the humor certainly outweighs the gore.  At one point, Ed and Shaun, having no weapons, resort to attacking oncoming zombies with their record collection.  They can't just pick anything to throw, though - even in crisis one must decide if the Batman soundtrack is worthy of saving.  In another scene, Shaun and Ed are leaving the Winchester while quite inebriated, singing a song with, unbeknownst to them, tonal accompaniment from the walking undead!  The comedy in this film is certainly memorable.  The squeamish may just want to cover their eyes at the nasty parts.Shaun of the Dead was directed by Edgar Wright, the mastermind behind the British sitcom ""Spaced"" from which Simon Pegg and Nick Frost also originated along with Jessica Hynes, who makes a funny cameo in the film as the yin to Shaun's yang.  She is leading a team of friends in the fight against the zombies who happen to look and dress similarly to the party that Shaun is leading.If you are easily bothered by horror films, you may be put off when thinking about picking up this movie.  But rest assured, the zombies aren't all that scary and the brief shots of gore are few and far between so that you can turn away when necessary but still enjoy the movie.  My roommate has a phobia of zombies and she was able to watch this film with little problem.  Although, she hasn't let us live down turning the lights off.If you'd like to see any of Simon Pegg's or Nick Frost's work, or if you want to enjoy a less dry brand of British humor, then this is a great place to start.  If you have ever been fortunate enough to catch some episodes of ""Spaced"", Shaun of the Dead follows a similar pattern.  Edgar Wright is an excellent director and the way he shoots certain scenes is a joy to watch.  For zombie humor with heart, consider Shaun of the Dead!",5,There's nothing scary about Shaun of the Dead.,1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,3155,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'British', 'comedy', 'movie', 'excellent', 'ease', 'nothing', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'humor', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'American', 'humor', 'British', 'accent', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'involve', 'zombies.Shaun', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'riddled', 'guilt', 'girlfriend', 'Liz', 'Kate', 'Ashfield', 'finally', 'enough', 'juvenile', 'ways', 'Shaun', 'friend', 'roommate', 'Ed', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'console', 'local', 'pub', 'Winchester', 'where', 'spend', 'free', 'time', 'Simultaneously', 'zombie', 'invasion', 'occurring', 'Shaun', 'win', 'Liz', 'back', 'two', 'friends', 'Dianne', 'Lucy', 'Davis', 'David', 'Dylan', 'Moran', 'are', 'trying', 'keep', 'away', 'Shaun', 'good', 'intentions.Shaun', 'retail', 'job', 'lazy', 'bachelor', 'life', 'idea', 'good', 'time', 'going', 'Winchester', 'night', 'understandable', 'why', 'Dianne', 'David', 'would', 'want', 'better', 'Liz', 'Soon', 'gang', 'town', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'zombies', 'Shaun', 'grow', 'up', 'prioritize', 'save', 'stepfather', 'so', 'be', 'kill', 'landlord', 'who', 'will', 'soon', 'turn', 'zombie', 'so', 'be', 'never', 'liked', 'much', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'violent', 'times', 'humor', 'certainly', 'gore', 'one', 'point', 'Ed', 'Shaun', 'having', 'weapons', 'resort', 'attacking', 'oncoming', 'zombies', 'record', 'collection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'pick', 'anything', 'throw', 'even', 'crisis', 'one', 'must', 'decide', 'Batman', 'soundtrack', 'worthy', 'saving', 'scene', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'are', 'leaving', 'Winchester', 'quite', 'inebriated', 'singing', 'song', 'unbeknownst', 'tonal', 'accompaniment', 'walking', 'undead', 'comedy', 'film', 'certainly', 'memorable', 'squeamish', 'may', 'just', 'want', 'cover', 'eyes', 'nasty', 'parts.Shaun', 'Dead', 'was', 'directed', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'mastermind', 'British', 'sitcom', 'Spaced', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'also', 'originated', 'Jessica', 'Hynes', 'who', 'funny', 'cameo', 'film', 'yin', 'Shaun', 'yang', 'leading', 'team', 'friends', 'fight', 'zombies', 'who', 'happen', 'look', 'dress', 'similarly', 'party', 'Shaun', 'leading.If', 'are', 'easily', 'bothered', 'horror', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'when', 'thinking', 'picking', 'up', 'movie', 'rest', 'assured', 'zombies', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary', 'brief', 'shots', 'gore', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'so', 'can', 'turn', 'away', 'when', 'necessary', 'still', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'roommate', 'phobia', 'zombies', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'film', 'little', 'problem', ""n't"", 'let', 'live', 'down', 'turning', 'lights', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'work', 'want', 'enjoy', 'less', 'dry', 'brand', 'British', 'humor', 'then', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'catch', 'episodes', 'Spaced', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'similar', 'pattern', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'excellent', 'director', 'way', 'certain', 'scenes', 'joy', 'watch', 'zombie', 'humor', 'heart', 'consider', 'Shaun', 'Dead']",Shaun of the Dead

841102,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002MJT0I,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[95, 117]","Hearing that ""Shaun of the Dead"" is the most popular British zombie comedy of all time does give one pause, simply because you have to stop for a second and wonder as to whether you have simply missed other British zombie comedies or if you maybe took ""28 Day Later"" way too seriously.  The thing is that when you hear ""British zombie comedy"" you are thinking ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" or ""Benny Hill"" or ""Black Adder"" or ""Asbolutely Fabulous"" or ""Coupling.""  You are not thinking something that is as restrained as what Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have put together (the pair co-wrote the film, Pegg stars as Shaun and Wright directs), which is probably the biggest surprise of all.""Shaun of the Dead"" is only four star funny, so we are not even close to ""Airplane!"" territory, which is still the funniest film of all time (measured in number of laughs generated) but there is another dimension to the film beyond the humor.  The tagline tries to tells us that this movie is: ""A romantic comedy. With zombies.""  The really funny thing is that, underneath it all, it really is a romantic comedy.  You know: boy meets girl, girl dumps boy, zombies try to kill boy and girl and mom and flat mates, boy tries to rescue girl and mom and flat mates, so on and so forth.Actually the movie that that came to mind the most, despite the references to the great zombie movies of the past (""We're coming to get you, Barbara!""), was ""Young Frankenstein,"" specifically in terms of the scenes that are played totally straight.  There are scenes when Shaun deals with his girl, Liz (Kate Ashfield), his mom, Barbara (Penelope Wilton), and his best bud, Ed (Nick Frost) that are done like they were in a romantic comedy, and not an Adam Sandler ""Water Boy"" type romantic comedy, but an Adam Sandler ""50 First Dates"" type romantic comedy.  Stripped of the zombies this is a rather pedestrian romantic comedy, but what makes it inspired lunacy is that it IS being done in the middle of a zombie movie.There are two prime moments that reflect this rather amazing tightrope walking act.  One is when Shaun almost breaks and notes that there may be a limit as to how many people he loves that he can shoot in one day.  The other is when we have one of those ""goodbye"" scenes usually found in war movies; it is not just the silliness of the particular bit of business returning from the start of the movie, but that it is brought back at that particular moment, and that both actors honestly treat it as the most serious thing in the world.  Tragedy is hard, but comedy is harder, and then there is treating tragedy as comedy in the middle of a zombie movie.  Watching this movie is like watching somebody take a stupid shot in a basketball game and you start saying, ""No, no, no, no, no..."" until the ball rips through the nets and then you smile and say ""Great shot!""The other great bit of fun is how ""Shaun of the Dead"" plays with the genre movies.  The opening of the film throws every clich&eacute; moment of being suddenly surprised by zombies in the history of the cinema at Shaun, only to have everything be normal.  So you know they will take a totally different tack when it comes to Shaun realizing he has missed the dawn of the dead.  The bit you have seen in the preview about arguing over which LPs to use as weapons to fight the living dead is cute, but the comic masterpiece in this film is Shaun channel surfing.  Every single channel is talking about what is happening, but Shaun is clicking so rapidly that he misses getting a complete picture.  Note: always listen to what is on the telly in the background: that is where the best ""28 Days Later"" joke in the film comes (All of the talking heads are actually British television news talking heads, so translate that into Brokaw, Jennings, and Rather doing the same thing for an American movie; see the ""TV BITS"" in the DVD extras).The more you know about zombie movies the more you will enjoy ""Shaun of the Dead,"" because you will be able to pick up on all the specific references.  But then I have never seen ""Spaced,"" so all of the homages to that British situation comedy involving Pegg, Frost and Wright are lost on me and I am doing okay at the moment.  Either way, I think the humor of the film is accessible to even zombie movie neophytes, although the only way you might be able to talk them into seeing this one is to tell them their other choice is ""Dawn of the Dead"" (I do not have to tell anyone that is a rather obvious double bill).Of the DVD extras the extended bits and outtakes in ""MISSING BITS"" are okay, but by favorite are the trio of ""Plot Holes,"" where we get some insights into what we did not see in the movie from three of the principle characters.  These are presented in comic book form as opposed to having actual footage, but that simply adds to their charm.  There are better bits in ""RAW MEAT,"" the highlight of which is the ""pitch"" by Pegg and Wright to sell the studio their movie idea.  I already talked about the ""TV BITS,"" and no one will be surprised that I the Zombie Trivia available via the ZOMB-O-METER.  Overall, the DVD extras are well above average but not knock down dead, get up as a reanimated corpse and try to eat human flesh great.",5,Everything you would expect in a zombie comedy and

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Shaun (Simon Pegg) is an electronics store employee, whose prospects for a successful life and/or career were mostly ruined since like always by Ed (Nick Frost), a slob and a slacker allergic to work, who enjoys the most being gross, vulgar and insult people. Ed basically lives on Shaun's coach and subsists on Shaun's hand-outs.As if Ed was not enough of a problem, Shaun is also considered as a big disappointment by his mother Barbara (Penelope Wilton) and especially by his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). He is also disliked by his stepfather Phillip (Bill Nighy), totally disrespected by his younger work colleagues and is in conflict with his housemate Pete (Peter Serafinowicz). His one joy and consolation in life is his favourite pub, the Winchester, where he and Ed spend every evening.And then one day, a zombie invasion begins&#8230;This is a quite honest comedy, with some pretty good jokes, not the least of which is the fact that initially Shaun and Ed (not being very bright) are completely oblivious to the undead threat and the apocalypse that just began&#8230;))) Once they really realise what is happening (it is then almost the middle of the film), well, for a time jokes decline a little bit in quality, but things get better again towards the end. I particularly appreciated the final scenes, in which we discover that zombies, once appropriately trained, can be actually used as cheap labour or partners in some entertainment activities&#8230;)))Other than the weaker jokes in the middle of the film I had also a little problem with Ed, whose character was for my taste a little bit overdone  &#8211; this guy is so repulsively gross and foul that it was actually difficult to watch him by moments&#8230;But still, this is a very honest, mostly funny comedy, which parodies very nicely zombie flicks and other disaster movies.

I was originally expecting a pure comedy, but that's not what it is.While ""Shaun of the Dead"" is predominantly a spoof of ""Dawn of the Dead"", it does touch on a variety of different topics in a semi-serious way.The title character Shaun is a 29 year old stuck in a dead end job supervising teenage co-workers. He can't seem to get it right with his girlfriend, Liz, and he never goes to visit his mother.What makes this movie hilarious is that it took an apocalyptic event for Shaun to get his life in gear.  While that doesn't sound funny, it surely is made funny by Simon Pegg's performance as Shaun.Great dialog, a new twist on a common horror theme, and a little seriousness thrown in make this a great film.

841118,A21I9K8YVL89VH,B0002MJT0I,Mark,"[1, 1]","It could be called a habit, it could be called an obsession...I call it love.I had heard about ""Shaun of the Dead"" about a year ago.And, as always with ANY film dealing with the Living Dead, the anticiapation grew.  Over the years, since George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" drew my attention, I had used Romero's films as a basis for what a 'good' zombie film should look like, feel like...(taste like?)...Normally, when it comes to horror mixing with comedy in films, most viewers are disappointed.  There's a 'recipe' for integrating these two genres, and most outcomes are disasterous.  I must admit that I prefer straight-up horror; I love the feeling of my adrenaline racing, the feel of encompasing darkness surrounding me in a theatre as I watch the story unfold.  But, occasionally, a film will slip through that cover and hit me because of it's unique style, with such force, that I have to admit that, yes, the two genres can work off of one another...It just takes a director with great timing, actors who can deliver the lines with superb authority and a pace that draws me in as a viewer.With ""Shaun of the Dead"", I found all of that...And more!As a parody of Zombie films, and playing off George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" title, ""Shaun of the Dead"" introduced us to the title character, Shaun.  Following a typical day in Shaun's life as a retail clerk, the audience is introduced to a cast of lively characters (well, in the beginning they are alive).  The director uses a number of quirky relationships to play off one another as the world starts to fall apart, and the dead begin to walk.  A number of times, I sat there, feeling that, maybe, just maybe, Shaun was starting to catch on to what was going on in the world around him, but, no, Shaun just...well, he just didn't get it.  With this, it was the timing that worked, the delivery of the lines and, all in all, the reactions of the actors to the environment and situation that made the scenes work.Peter Jackson brought us ""Dead Alive"" a few years back.  A film about the Living Dead, splashed with comedy, ""Dead Alive"" succeeded in following the 'recipe' for combining the horror and comedy genres.  With ""Shaun of the Dead"", we have seen success again.  Sure, there are moments of horrific violence, but it's done in such a light-hearted way that you can't help but smile as a girl falls back on a metal pipe which pierces a hole several inches wide in her stomach.  The blood is gratuitous at some points, but neither the horror aspects, nor the comedy aspects, distract from one another.This past week I picked up a copy of ""Shaun of the Dead"", brought it home and watched it...and watched it again...In five days, I had watched the film eight times.  In fact, writing this review has gotten me so fired up over the film again, that I'm going to pop it in and watch it again...Hold on...There we go.  Anyways, I need to go make some popcorn.

841120,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,B0002MJT0I,Mat,"[4, 10]","There will be unintentional spoilers periodically.I'm the type of person who doesn't read movie reviews before I watch the film. I don't seek out trailers online, or read the latest dish on upcoming releases. I prefer to go into a film with a clean slate, knowing as little as possible about the film before I see it. I find the movie going experience more enjoyable when I have less pre-conceived conceptions about the movie I'm about to watch. That being said, I love to read reviews and seek out trivia about movies that I have already seen. I am addicted to the Internet Movie Data Base's Trivia section. I enjoy reading other peoples thoughts and ideas about a movie and compare them to my own.Since living in France I have completely been out of the entertainment loop. We don't have a TV and it is rare that we go to a new movie. I do visit a few web sites to keep up with the news and hear bits and pieces of the movies that are coming and out and generating some buzz. Shaun of the Dead is a film that I have been hearing buzz about for several months. I refused to read any reviews or really research any aspect of the movie, but I couldn't help but hear bits and pieces of good things about. Primarily that it was a funny zombie spoof. Being a fan of the zombie genre, when the chance came up to borrow the dvd, I didn't hesitate to take it.The plot is the pretty standard zombie plot. Some type of radiation/virus wreaks havoc on the earth re-animating the dead into brainless, homicidal maniacs. The movie does a good job of spoofing many of the conventions of the genre. The title character, Shaun, is so stuck in his hum drum existence it takes him a couple of days to realize that his city has been attacked by zombies. He has a dead end job, his girlfriend just broke up with him, and his flat mates are constantly fighting. Despite their being several zombies eating human flesh around him and the constant media blitz about them, it literally takes a zombie in his back yard for Sean to notice. There are a number of truly funny scenes that mimic many of the classic zombie cliche's.Here, the zombies walk in the classic, slow motion, brain dead way. They are mockingishly slow. In one scene Sean and his friend, Ed, throw a large crate full of junk at two zombies, then have time to run for a crate of records and argue which records are crappy enough to launch. The entire time the zombies are slowly walking towards them to devour Sean and his friend. Other scenes have one zombie being beaten with pool sticks repeatedly to little or no effect. Time and time again there are little digs at the genre conventions while still lovingly following them.A quick perusal of IMDB's list of trivia for this film will show plenty of references to nearly every zombie film imaginable. I consider myself a fan of zombie films, but these guys must be nuts about them. They've set up multiple scenes that are exact homage to older films. They've lifted lines right out of the classics of the genre. I must say that while reading the list I became more impressed with what the filmmakers created with this picture, but while watching it most of the references went over my head. As I said, I like zombie movies. They're gorey, violent, bloody and often hilarious (intentional or otherwise). I have seen more than my fair share of good and awful zombie flicks. Yet here, most of the references were naught caught by me. I can't exactly fault a film for referencing so many other films, yet I have to wonder who but the diehard zombie fanatic caught them.My biggest complaint with the film is that it is too comedic, without being funny enough. What I mean by that is that the production is made like a comedy. The actors play their parts as if they are in a comedy and not the horrible zombie addled situation that is scripted. Sure, there are a few moments of anguished screaming and fear, but those are over acted and far between. The story is truly frightening, the dead of came to life and are devouring the city. This is not a light hearted romp. Though often quite funny, zombie films play the situation straight. I felt let down that everyone was playing the situation for gags and not allowing the comedy to be more organic, or to flow out of the conventions of the genre itself. In the end I didn't find the movie funny enough for all that. It was played for humor all the way through, yet I wasn't laughing nearly enough. Some of this comes from not getting all the ""in"" jokes. Some of this is also, likely enough, because it is a British comedy at heart. There are a number of bits that seem to play better for the British sensibilities than my American in France heart. There were several moments that I could see the joke play out and ""get"" it, but it wasn't enough to really make me laugh. This is not to say the movie isn't funny. Because it is, often hilarious even. It's just that the tone of the film was of great comedy, and the buzz I had heard matched this. Yet while watching it, I didn't find it as funny as expected.While thinking about this review I began to wonder how I would make a zombie spoof better. It wouldn't be right to go the Zucker brothers way. I got over that type of comedy in junior high, and the genre (well the horror genre which zombie movies are a sub-genre of) has been spoofed in this way enough (see Scary Movie). Slap stick spoofs were perfected by Sam Raimi in the Evil Dead series. In the end I decided that what the filmmakers were trying to do with this film is exactly the way to do it. I just think they missed the mark a little. I think I was partially disappointed because the genre itself has produced enough unintentional humor. Zombie movies are so often insanely bad, they are great fun. It is difficult to spoof a convention when the convention itself is so awful it seems a spoof unto itself. Likewise some of the conventions such as the ineptness and slow walk of the zombies has been revamped by the likes of Danny Boyle. Instead, here, I would have preferred a darker, bloodier movie. I don't believe this would have hurt the comedy. The references and homages could have stayed in tact and comedy could come out of horrific situations.Shaun of the Dead is a fine movie. It spoofs a genre of film that is dear to my heart, yet remains firmly a fan of the genre. It references so many of the classics and non classics of the genre that you'll need encyclopedic knowledge of zombies to catch them all. It is truly funny and makes a great party movie. Where it fails, it fails as a zombie movie. It is made for jokes and not scares, and there it falls a little flat for a good spoof. But certainly worth the price of the rental.",3,Flawed Spoof,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,6698,"['will', 'be', 'unintentional', 'spoilers', 'periodically.I', ""'m"", 'type', 'person', 'who', ""n't"",

Rather than a cliched, stereotypical 'hunky guy saves cute girl from the zombies', with 'good always prevails over evil', this is a funny and refreshing take. Yes, there's a guy, and a girl, and he tries to save her, but it is in no way old or contrived. There's also lots of funny bits, like when Shaun is leading his group through the backyards, and passes another group which is similar to his in personality/body types, and all say 'hi' to the other as they pass by, or the group trying to fit in with the zombies (and actually managing to do so!)I also like the camera work and action (also seen in 'Hot Fuzz'), and felt it was very creative. There's some nice and sentimental bits in here, like Shaun and his stepdad. Overall, this is a great movie to watch with friends, and the ending will have you in stitches, it's simply too funny and quirky to forget, and really fit in with the rest of the movie. 4.5/5 stars for a great zombie movie!",5,Highly entertaining zombie romp,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,1068,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', ""'serious"", 'horror/zombie', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'cast', 'actors', 'plot', 'great', 'Rather', 'cliched', 'stereotypical', ""'hunky"", 'guy', 'saves', 'cute', 'girl', 'zombies', ""'good"", 'always', 'evil', 'funny', 'refreshing', 'take', 'Yes', 'guy', 'girl', 'save', 'way', 'old', 'contrived', 'also', 'lots', 'funny', 'bits', 'when', 'Shaun', 'leading', 'group', 'backyards', 'group', 'similar', 'personality/body', 'types', 'say', ""'hi"", 'other', 'pass', 'group', 'trying', 'fit', 'zombies', 'actually', 'managing', 'do', 'so', 'also', 'camera', 'work', 'action', 'also', 'seen', ""'Hot"", 'Fuzz', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'creative', 'nice', 'sentimental', 'bits', 'here', 'Shaun', 'stepdad', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'friends', 'ending', 'will', 'have', 'stitches', 'simply', 'too', 'funny', 'quirky', 'forget', 'really', 'fit', 'rest', 'movie', '4.5/5', 'stars', 'great', 'zombie', 'movie']",Shaun of the Dead
841125,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0002MJT0I,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[7, 8]","I was actually quite surprised I enjoyed this movie, considering I didn't enjoy the original Dawn of the Dead one little bit. I laughed at loads of bits during the film, and bits I probably shouldn't have laughed at too! I also wanted the characters to survive in this, and was disappointed if they didn't. I couldn't have given two figsticks about the characters in the original.There's not many actors that people will recognise, many are from (obscure) British TV shows. I only recognised Lucy Davis who played Dawn in the Office. Many Americans might not know any of them apart from Bill Nighy, and I can only think of one of his movies - Love Actually. (Watch out for Tim from The Office in a blink and you'll miss him role, as Yvonne's boyfriend. I blinked at the wrong time, and had to re-watch that scene) I'm having to review the theatrical release, despite having seen the DVD, as it's not out for another couple of days in the US yet. Because of the timing and the indisputable similarity of the names, the distributors were forced to hold the film back until two weeks after the remake of Dawn of the Dead was released in the UK.There's quite a few injokes, and other references to movies in this. I didn't spot a lot of them, and had to get told them after the movie had finished. But I only spot the obvious. Shaun works at Foree Electronics. Ken Foree was one of the stars of the original Dawn of the Dead. At one point, Ed (Nick Frost) warns Shaun's mum (Penelope Wilton): ""We're coming to get you, Barbara"". This line is a reference to a line from the beginning of George Romero's seminal zombie movie Night of the Living Dead. At the end of the film, as Shaun (Simon Pegg) flicks through TV channels (look out for Trisha!), a voice can be heard saying that claims that the epidemic was due to rage infected monkeys have now been dismissed as b.. Liz turns off before the voice can finish the sentence. The voice is referencing 28 Days Later..., another British zombie movie. When the Universal logo appears at the start of the film, the music playing is taken from the soundtrack to the original Dawn of the Dead. Also, the end credits feature a new recording of the shopping-mall music from the same film. The TV news reports Shaun and Ed watch feature an anchorman who utters the exact same phrases as the TV reporter in Night of the Living Dead. When Shaun comes into work, one of his co-workers mentions something about someone named Ash calling out from work. Ash is the name of Bruce Campbell's character in the Evil Dead trilogy. The choreographed pool-cue beating of the zombie in the Winchester (synchronized to the Queen soundtrack) is a carefully referenced homage to the balletic assault on the homeless man in A Clockwork Orange - and also one of the daftest scenes in the whole movie! Chris Martin of Coldplay, who appears as himself on a news report near the end of the film promoting ZombAid, also plays a zombie. After Shaun and Liz escape from the basement of The Winchester, he can be seen playing the zombie walking past the phone box from right to left. Shaun berates Ed for calling the creatures ""zombies"" (which they are, of course). This may be referring to the fact that many zombie movies (including Night of the Living Dead and Resident Evil) never mention the word ""zombie"" at all. More likely this is a reference to Danny Boyle - director of 28 Days Later... - and his insistence that it isn't a zombie movie. When Shaun finds his zombie house mate in the shower he utters the words ""Join us"" in a half whispered tone. This is a reference to the first two Evil Dead films where the zombies are always asking Ash (also mentioned in the department store) to ""join us"". All the names of the characters give some clue to their eventual fate: Shaun is re-born, Liz lives, Ed is dead, Dave ends up in the grave, Di dies, Barbara ends up a cadaver, Yvonne has moved on.Once again, the zombies were very robotic (one of my gripes for the original Dawn Of The Dead), but it was just probably paying homage to that.I love the way the film portrays where Shaun lives. It could be any town in Britain. My favourite bit is when he's on the bus. No one speaks, or even dares to look at another person in the eye, and there's always someone with an overly loud walkman on.This is a great zombie movie, and loads better than the originals. Definitely a must-see for a laugh. And instead of being in a shopping mall, it's mainly based in a pub.

841135,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0002MJT0I,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[34, 41]","The zombie genre has been done to (ahem) death by now.  Sam Raimi proved that it could be a successful vehicle for launching more expensive films with Evil Dead.  Since then, there's been an endless array of less engaging imitators, often confusing gore with content.Zombie movies can be summed up in exactly the same way. The difference is in the inflection.  Don't believe me?  Let me demonstrate...ZOMBIE TROPE #1: ""Zombie movies are about SHAMBLING dead people.""  These zombie movies laugh at the absolute absurdity of the walking dead.  I mean, they're dead and they stumble around like DRUNK people for crying out loud!  How can you take anything serious that moans like an overly hormonal teenager on prom night, lolls its head to the side like a Valley girl, and can't even walk in a straight line?  Zombies definitely have a lot of humor potential, as established in Evil Dead II.  The shamble is one of the primary reasons that modern zombie movies have made their zombies move quickly-it's hard to take slow moving zombies seriously.ZOMBIE TROPE #2: ""Zombie movies are about shambling DEAD people.""  These zombie movies concentrate on the horrors of what it means to have corpses trying to eat you.  It is visceral and disgusting.  There is gore (dead bodies are gross) and decay.  These zombies are rotting and, thanks to the magic of special effects, really do look like exhumed corpses.  This is just about every zombie movie that takes itself seriously without devolving into camp.ZOMBIE TROPE #3: ""Zombie movies are about shambling dead PEOPLE.""  These zombie movies aren't about the zombies.  They're about how people react to the fact that people they knew who were dead are walking around trying to eat other people.  The presence of zombies causes people to freak out.  Some folks are barely over their mourning when their spouses and children rise up to attack them.  It's enough to make a person snap.  It's also George Romero's specialty, a topic he has extensively covered in the Living Dead series.Recent zombie movies have been combinations of these three attributes, but rarely in equal balance. Shaun of the Dead?  It's all three.Shaun (Simon Pegg) is the hero of the title, a fellow who has long since exited the swinging college years and entered into the stale, zombie-like grind of a working man.  He is a man out of time, frozen in his own routines.  He still lives with his two flatmates, Ed (Nick Frost), the fat, funny one and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), the smart, successful one.  Shaun is trapped, unable to go back to the good old days of no responsibility and unwilling to go forward with his relationship to his blonde girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).Meanwhile, ambulances start popping up in the background, carting away twitching body bags.The outcome of their situation is an inevitability that we've all witnessed before: Liz has had enough.  She doesn't want to keep going to the same old pub every night: the Winchester, named after the rifle on the wall.  She hates Shaun's best friend Ed, who is an offensive boor.  And Shaun hates Liz's good friends Dianne (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran).  As it turns out, David used to date Liz and just tolerates Dianne so he can be near her.Meanwhile, paramilitary vehicles drive by and newscasters report troubling news about some sort of plague.And oh yeah, Shaun loves his mum (Nicola Cunningham) and hates his step-dad, Philip (Bill Nighy), a perpetually frowning robot of a man whose face has been untouched by any other expression.When Liz finally gets sick of Shaun, his world falls apart. He goes on a drunken binge with Ed, blasting music, playing video games, and shutting out the world around him.  In essence, Shaun's life has finally gone out of joint and he desperately regresses to deal with it.  Unfortunately for Shaun (and everyone else in that part of England), the world has also literally fallen apart.A large part of the humor is how Shaun and his compatriots deal with the undead.  It takes a very long time for him to even notice; after all, who would really notice slow moving people?  The director, Edgar Wright, gleefully makes this point at every turn.  At first, the zombies are just the homeless, who everybody ignores and expects to act strangely.  Then, it's people in menial jobs that have a glazed look as they go about their drudgery.  It's not until a zombie actually shows up on their doorstep that anybody gets concerned.  Even then, they figure the zombie is just really, really drunk.Once Shaun and Ed come to grips with the situation, they devise a plan.  Their plans are highly unrealistic, but mostly involve beating on zombies with clubs (remember, no guns in England), rescuing girlfriends and mums, and holing up in the Winchester, ""cause it's the safest place.""  That's right, the one place Liz doesn't want to be with the people she really doesn't want to be with.Shaun of the Dead embraces all the zombie tropes, and then rips their guts out.  Sure, the movie seems to say, it's easy to get around slow moving zombies.  But eventually they catch up with you.  Sure, smashing a zombie's head in sounds easy...until it's a family member.  Sure, shooting a zombie with a rifle should give you the upper hand...unless you've never actually shot a gun before.In the mean time, Shaun deals with his issues with his step-dad, introduces his girlfriend to his mom, meets an ex-girlfriend (who seems to be far more capable than Liz), finally gets tired of drug-dealing Ed's antics, and slowly realizes just how fragile his humdrum life is.  It seems to encapsulate his mom, Liz, and Ed at first, but Shaun discovers that his circle of family and friends extends to more people than he thought.This movie is deadly earnest about everything, including its humor. It has traumatizing gore, hysterical in-jokes, and weep-worthy moments of true drama.  All of it is pulled off with incredible aplomb by the cast, who have to do everything from beat on zombies to act like zombies (no, really) to finally going utterly ballistic like real human beings.Shaun of the Dead is the culmination of dozens of zombie movies that have gone before it.  It succeeds because it focuses on the people, gives shambling corpses the respect they deserve (which is to say, very little and a lot, depending on the scene), and dramatizes the horror of dead people coming back to a tortured semi-existence.No self-respecting horror fan should miss this movie.",5,No self-respecting horror fan should miss this movie,1097193600,"10 8,

The main character is just moving along in life, happy, drinking beer, playing video games, and not cleaning up his place.  Suddenly BANG, there is an alien invasion, or his aunt dies, or he gets cancer and he has to examine his life.  Is he going anywhere?  Is he doing anything for the next generation?  Will anybody remember him if he falls down the stairs and breaks his neck?That is this movie.  Shaun, a man who does not realize he is a failure is forced to face that fact after his girlfriend dumps him because he is not doing anything with his life.

It is a movie about not listening to your girlfriend.  I mean, really, why does he have to cure cancer or save the planet from zombies?

Any of those labels undercuts this entertaining film.  Just because a story has a healthy dose of humor that doesn't mean it should be dismissed as merely a comedy send up.  Shaun of the Dead is much more sophisticated that that.  Mostly.The cleverness of this film is that it understands that zombie movies have been done to death, and that makes them predictable.  But the question is, if we suddenly found ourselves in the middle of one, how long would it take us to notice?  It takes Shaun quite a while, and when he does, he's like any of us.  Scared, confused, and more than a little incompetent, which leads to a lot of comic situations.But this is not just a comedy.  People die.  Gruesomely.  Shaun experiences real loss.  And the best and worst of people is explored in a way that is often seen in zombie movies but still somehow seems fresh and interesting in this one.The only weak spot is the end, which is a bit jokey and in my opinion, just a step out of tune with the rest of the film.

Its without a doubt the best movie to come out of the UK in the last five years.Simon Pegg is wonderful as Shaun, the ultimate everyman with his sidekick Nick Frost as Ed. The rest of the cast are wonderful and a veritable whos who of British comedy, with Lucy Davis from the smash hit ""The Office"" and utterly fabulous Dylan Moran who is perhaps one of the greatest Irish standup comics ever.The film was not what I was expecting at all. I was expecting a kind of typical spoof on all levels, with lots of ""in jokes"" for people who love Zombie movies. But that isnt what I got at all. It actually had a plot. A good one at that. You feel for these characters, especially Shaun who has to see more than a few of his loved ones fall prey to the flesh eating followers. I was choked up at the scenes with his mother and the goodbye to Ed in the cellar. There is genuine tension created with the character David, proving Dylan Morans wonderful range as a dramatic actor.  As a result this film has just as much credibilty, if not more, than the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead.On the extras front, this is a perfect example of how to produce a real dvd. The wealth of commentaries (on the uk release) is wonderful.

Combining blood, guts and gore with cultural icons such as the cricket bat, the spade and undertones of understatement, I nearly choked to death on this one. I am still in some discomfort from laughing.Simon Pegg is just a treat as Shaun, (the hero of the story), and his facial features, mannerisms and expressions caused more than a few discomforting muscular spasms and cramping. Nick Frost is also the perfect guy to play the slob best friend Ed. Their adventures in attempting to rescue Liz, (Shaun's ex-girlfriend), his Mum and her husband, along with Liz's friends, are hilarious.One of the things I especially liked about this movie is the way in which the gore is not the only humour. In typical British style, the humour comes on a few different levels, and that provides some more interest. Situational humour figures big in this movie, for example with Shaun and Ed making an impromptu rap song with a zombie providing back-up groans was a highlight. The humour went from the simplistic to quite subtle in the same movie. It provided a depth that could be enjoyed by most people.I thought it was a great movie, and was a lot of fun.

""Shaun of the Dead"" stars Simon Pegg as Shaun, a man with no real ambition who meanders through his daily routines.  He seems quite content with his job at an electronics store, going to the Winchester (the local pub), and hanging out with his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) and his roommate Ed (Nick Frost).  But things take a drastic turn when Liz gives him an ultimatum.After Liz breaks up with him, things for Shaun go from bad to worse.  Oblivious to the news reports of strange things happening in the vicinity, Shaun goes about his day until he and Ed notice a stranger in their backyard.  At first assuming that the lady is drunk, Shaun and Ed quickly realize the predicament they're in.  So what do they do?  They immediately run to the television to see the local news while they're having tea.Soon, with cricket bat in tow, the pair devises a plan.  First, the two concoct several scenarios to save Shaun's mom, Barbara (Penelope Wilton) and stepfather, Philip (Bill Nighy), who has already been bitten by a zombie.  Although they differ, at first, on where they should end up, one thing is for sure, they're going to kill Philip.  The next part of the plan is to rescue Liz and her friends Diane (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran).  After that, they'll comfortably stay at the Winchester until all is well once again.

I am so glad I overcame my queasiness and went to see it!This is not a zombie movie, it's a poke at common culture that happens to have zombies in it.

Because Shaun is a hero.  He is Everyman, from his penchant for drinking in his favorite pub to his ignorance of his girlfriend's wishes to his lack of enthusiasm over his job and quest for respect which will never come, right down to his incessant channel surfing which keeps him from catching wind of the growing panic outside his door.  That's where the comedy is rooted, in the places where the audience can laugh at themselves because they really see themselves onscreen.  And then there are some simply hilarious moments, such as the one outside the pub when Shaun and his roommate sing drunkenly and think they are being backed up by a fellow drinker who we know is merely a moaning zombie.

Could his life be any worse? Well shaun wakes up one morning to find a deadly virus is quickly turning the population of England into zombies.

841159,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0002MJT0I,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 2]","This brilliantly funny and romance/zombie/comedy is everything an older horror fan could ask for.  Shaun of the Dead, the brainchild of star/co-writer Simon Pegg and director/co-writer Edgar Wright provides loads of laughs while piling on buckets of blood and gore along the way.  Pegg plays Shaun, a late-20's electronics salesman who soon realizes his life is going nowhere.  His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) has just dumped him, which soon follows his attempt to drown his sorrows at the local pub with his slacker pal Ed (Nick Frost).  All the while, all of Britain is under siege by a fast spreading zombie plague, and soon enough, Shaun and Ed are bashing heads and spilling brains in an effort to save Liz, Shaun's mother and stepfather, and a few other friends while trying to make way to the pub.  Paying homage to the original Dawn of the Dead as well as other films in the genre (""we're coming to get you Barbara!""), Shaun of the Dead is a joy from beginning to end.  There's plenty of quirky British humor, and plenty of gory zombie horror as well.  It's singlehandedly the best zombie movie to come along in a long time, and while it's horror elements aren't original in the least, it doesn't try to be.

I've got to say some parts are kind of ""dumb"" but that doesn't matter because the rest of the film is hilarious. The thing that astonished me in the theater is that they are british. In the previews they don't really sound british so I guess it was a shock to me.The plot of Shaun of the Dead is actually pretty good, wich is another shocker to me as well. Shaun who is played by Simon Pegg, his character is sort of the serious one who just wants to get the job done, but his friend Ed (Nick Frost) is the complete opposite of Shaun. Ed is that friend you have who never takes anything seriously and tries to make everything fun. Every night Shaun and Ed head down to the Winchester, a local club where they always go but then Shaun's relationship with his girlfriend Liz, portrayed by Kate Ashfield falls apart from that scene. As Shaun's personal life falls into pieces, the apocalypse comes and turns thousands of England's community into mind eating zombies.

841164,ARIHVRQ9VH0OQ,B0002MJT0I,Nick Schwartz,"[4, 4]","Shaun of the Dead, Edgar Wright's parody of the zombie sub-genre of motion pictures, does almost everything right.  It is a comedy with a heart, and more importantly, a great and consistent idea of what it is spoofing, (an element missing in other spoofs, such as parts of the Scary Movie films).  If you are at all familiar with zombie films, you will be laughing from the first scene to the last, and although the film is not a laugh-a-minute (it is a bit more serious than the trailers made it out to be), it offers up enough pokes and prods at other zombie films to keep even the most die-hard zombie fan entertained.Shaun works in an electronics store, lives with two roommates in London, one of which is his best friend Ed, whom, despite trying hard to keep people happy always seems to wind up disappointing instead.  Shaun's girlfriend Liz breaks up with him, since his life does not seem to have a direction, and he spends all his nights at the pub in town, the Winchester.  Overnight, however, a virus spreads like wildfire through the streets of London, and people become zombies left and right.  Shaun takes it upon himself to save his mother, Ed, and Liz and her two roommates.The movie, (whose title, an obvious spoof on George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"", the secon in his zombie trilogy [soon to be a quadrilogy]), knows its influences well.  There are more than a couple homages to Romero's work, from newsreporters uttering famous lines from ""Night of the Living Dead"", to Ed screaming ""We're coming to get you Barbara!"" on the telephone to Shaun's mother, Barbara.Zombie regulars will also find references to the Evil Dead trilogy, a subtle but hilarious poke of fun at Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and more.From the social satire in the beginning and end, (suggesting people behave like zombies anyway), to the countless horror references, to the creative zombie gore, this movie is a must see for zombie fans.",4,A Zombie Comedy With a Heart - A Faithful Spoof,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,1930,"['Shaun', 'Dead', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'parody', 'zombie', 'sub-genre', 'motion', 'pictures', 'almost', 'everything', 'right', 'comedy', 'heart', 'more', 'importantly', 'great', 'consistent', 'idea', 'what', 'spoofing', 'element', 'missing', 'other', 'spoofs', 'such', 'parts', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'films', 'are', 'familiar', 'zombie', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'laughing', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'film', 'not', 'laugh-a-minute', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'trailers', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'up', 'enough', 'pokes', 'prods', 'other', 'zombie', 'films', 'keep', 'even', 'most', 'die-hard', 'zombie', 'fan', 'entertained.Shaun', 'electronics', 'store', 'two', 'roommates', 'London', 'one', 'best', 'friend', 'Ed', 'whom', 'trying', 'hard', 'keep', 'people', 'happy', 'always', 'wind', 'up', 'disappointing', 'instead', 'Shaun', 'girlfriend', 'Liz', 'up', 'life', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'direction', 'nights', 'pub', 'town', 'Winchester', 'Overnight', 'however', 'virus', 'spreads', 'wildfire', 'streets', 'London', 'people', 'become', 'zombies', 'left', 'right', 'Shaun', 'save', 'mother', 'Ed', 'Liz', 'two', 'roommates.The', 'movie', 'title', 'obvious', 'spoof', 'George', 'Romero', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'secon', 'zombie', 'trilogy', '[', 'soon', 'be', 'quadrilogy', ']', 'influences', 'well', 'are', 'more', 'couple', 'Romero', 'work', 'newsreporters', 'uttering', 'famous', 'lines', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Ed', 'screaming', ""'re"", 'coming', 'get', 'Barbara', 'telephone', 'Shaun', 'mother', 'Barbara.Zombie', 'regulars', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'references', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'trilogy', 'subtle', 'hilarious', 'poke', 'fun', 'Danny', 'Boyle', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'social', 'satire', 'beginning', 'end', 'suggesting', 'people', 'behave', 'zombies', 'anyway', 'countless', 'horror', 'references', 'creative', 'zombie', 'gore', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'zombie', 'fans']",Shaun of the Dead

His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is disappointed in his lack of ambition. Shaun's best friend Ed (Nick Frost) epitomizes this arrested development. Ed's simian humor (he literally imitates gorillas) amuses Shaun to no end, but leaves their other roommate, Shaun's girlfriend, and her judgmental roommates Diane and Dylan (Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran) cold.In the midst of his personal problems, Shaun finds himself in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Is this his chance to find his inner strength and get his life together? That is, if he survives?This comedy has amusing and surreal moments of silliness and satire, but its humor isn't for everyone. For those whose funny bone it doesn't strike, the film's strength comes from its metaphors. Shaun feels stuck in his routines, held back and a little dead inside--not unlike a zombie. In fact, the drones populating the city of London already resemble the living dead. Shaun is so oblivious to his fellow humans and the world around him, he hardly realizes an epidemic is upon them.Our hero's journey from overlooked ""loser"" to courageous leader is also satisfying. He finds himself torn between the well-intended but prepubescent friend of his youth and his girlfriend's affections. This is as much a relationship film as it is a horror movie.There are some bloody moments, though. Horror and horror-spoof fans will enjoy watching the nonplussed Shaun and his best mate battle zombies. Others might find the film diverting but not particularly memorable.

BUT, if you like wry, subtle humor this movie is worth a look!  I didn't expect much the first time I watched, but SHAUN OF THE DEAD delivered laughs, adventure, romance and realistic characters.  WELL ACTED, WELL SCRIPTED and WELL DONE!  Does require an attention span of more than video game proportions to appreciate the subtle, recuring humor themes throughout the movie.  Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Kate Ashfield are excellent throughout, as are the supporting cast.  Zombies are well done, too--not overblown or overly silly.  Some gore, but nothing gratuitous.  Well edited.  Overall, 2 hours of well acted, quality entertainment!  DVD extras are OK--not great, but the commentary is worth a listen.  Also, the OUTTAKES are rather good.  As a package, this DVD rates FIVE STARS in my book.  The humor doesn't get old or lose it's punch after multiple viewings and the story keeps you entertained through the whole length of the film.Again, NOT FOR ALL TASTES--if you LIKED the AIRPLANE movies, ANCHORMAN, ELF or similar films, you'll probably NOT ""get"" the humor in this movie.  But, if you're like me and you found the aforementioned films to be dull and senseless, then you'll probably find SHAUN OF THE DEAD to be a barrel of laughs (and who doesn't like ZOMBIES????).  Transcends the British/American humor gap as well.  Usually British humor doesn't register with me, but SHAUN OF THE DEAD seemed to hit the mark with a more universal type ""real world"" humor.  Overcomes the old ""two peoples separated by a common language"" problem as well--no need for a translator!!  Writers made a conscious effort to avoid slang with differing American/British meanings, so everything makes sense no matter which variety of English you speak!TO RECAP:  Wry, subtle humor that requires you to pay attention throughout the film--NOT a slapstick, silly comedy.  Lots of zombie action with traditional zombies--nothing overly silly.  Well acted, realistic, real world characters you can relate to.  Well scripted, well edited and entertaining!

841187,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B0002MJT0I,Poor Napoleon,"[0, 0]","Creating a formula picture is never a good idea - unless you have created a formula like Simong Pegg and Edgar Wright have done here.  Initially, ""Shaun of the Dead"" in title and in plot description, sounds like a mere parody of Romero's dead movies ala ""Scary Movie"" and such. But Wright and Pegg, in spoofing the genre, create an homage pic.  It's full of funny moments that tip their hit to Romero's 'Zed word' flicks, but it has so much original horror and humor to offer.Namely, the premise is original.  While many horror pics looks at the heroic survivors of a horrific tragedy, ""Shaun"" looks at those other guys.  Unlike the inhuman heroism of typical horror pics, Shaun and his friend Ed are unapologetic slackers. In fact, Shaun's desire to save his friends may do more harm than good.  Wright and Pegg craft an interesting bunch of characters that are really those other guys in horror films.  They're funny and horribly flawed.  Shaun's plan to save everyone is interesting in its successes and failures, breaking the trend of so much recent horror.  In all its comedy, you'll still care about every character in the end.  In that, its successful in its own right as a horror film, as much as it is in comedy.But it's the comedy that triumphs above all. The writing is razor sharp.  Listen to every piece of dialogue and you wil realize that Wright and Pegg have crafted an ingenious script that is constantly referencing itself as well as other horror movies.  Key to the writing though is the pitch perfect delivery.  This is something that Simon Pegg, in particular, has perfected.  His humor is rather dry, sometimes subtle.  Yet at the same time, he is also a brilliant physical comedian, as noted in this film's famous jukebox scene.Pegg doesn't ride alone in his talent though.  He has quite a bit of support, namely in his partner in crime Nick Frost - who's humor is much more direct as the lovable oaf Ed, and Dylan Moran, who has achieved fame in his own right doing stand up and in Black Books.  While visibly more sober here, Moran is impecable as the uptight critical friend of Shaun's girlfriend.But one sole review is not enough to express all the great things about 'Shaun of the Dead.'  You're best served by watching the film.  When you're done watch it again.  If you have time, watch it again and just listen to it to hear all the witty dialogue.  Then you can raid the extras.  This DVD is full of them.  While I love ""plot holes"" section, my favorite involves the making of the film.  This is far from standard 'making of' fare, as it traces ""Shaun"" from it's young origins.  Watch these guys at work - you'll realize more goes into this comedy than a simple script and a couple funny actors.Just as a side note, for those curious, the Region 2 DVD differs in the fact that the UK trailers are included and that 3 (coun them: 3!) more commentaries are included.",5,A new comedy formula *spolilers*,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,2896,"['Creating', 'formula', 'picture', 'never', 'good', 'idea', 'have', 'created', 'formula', 'Simong', 'Pegg', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'have', 'done', 'here', 'Initially', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'title', 'plot', 'description', 'mere', 'parody', 'Romero', 'dead', 'movies', 'ala', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'such', 'Wright', 'Pegg', 'spoofing', 'genre', 'create', 'homage', 'pic', 'full', 'funny', 'moments', 'tip', 'hit', 'Romero', 'word', 'flicks', 'so', 'much', 'original', 'horror', 'humor', 'offer.Namely', 'premise', 'original', 'many', 'horror', 'pics', 'heroic', 'survivors', 'horrific', 'tragedy', 'Shaun', 'other', 'guys', 'inhuman', 'heroism', 'typical', 'horror', 'pics', 'Shaun', 'friend', 'Ed', 'are', 'unapologetic', 'slackers', 'fact', 'Shaun', 'desire', 'save', 'friends', 'may', 'do', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'Wright', 'Pegg', 'craft', 'interesting', 'bunch', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'other', 'guys', 'horror', 'films', ""'re"", 'funny', 'horribly', 'flawed', 'Shaun', 'plan', 'save', 'everyone', 'interesting', 'successes', 'failures', 'breaking', 'trend', 'so', 'much', 'recent', 'horror', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'still', 'care', 'character', 'end', 'successful', 'own', 'right', 'horror', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'comedy.But', 'comedy', 'triumphs', 'writing', 'razor', 'sharp', 'Listen', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'wil', 'realize', 'Wright', 'Pegg', 'have', 'crafted', 'ingenious', 'script', 'constantly', 'referencing', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'Key', 'writing', 'though', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'delivery', 'something', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'particular', 'perfected', 'humor', 'rather', 'dry', 'sometimes', 'subtle', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'brilliant', 'physical', 'comedian', 'noted', 'film', 'famous', 'jukebox', 'scene.Pegg', ""n't"", 'ride', 'alone', 'talent', 'quite', 'bit', 'support', 'namely', 'partner', 'crime', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'who', 'humor', 'much', 'more', 'direct', 'lovable', 'oaf', 'Ed', 'Dylan', 'Moran', 'who', 'achieved', 'fame', 'own', 'right', 'doing', 'stand', 'up', 'Black', 'Books', 'visibly', 'more', 'sober', 'here', 'Moran', 'impecable', 'uptight', 'critical', 'friend', 'Shaun', 'girlfriend.But', 'one', 'sole', 'review', 'not', 'enough', 'express', 'great', 'things', ""'Shaun"", 'Dead', ""'re"", 'best', 'served', 'watching', 'film', 'When', ""'re"", 'done', 'watch', 'again', 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'listen', 'hear', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'Then', 'can', 'raid', 'extras', 'DVD', 'full', 'love', 'plot', 'holes', 'section', 'favorite', 'making', 'film', 'far', 'standard', ""'making"", 'fare', 'Shaun', 'young', 'origins', 'Watch', 'guys', 'work', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'more', 'comedy', 'simple', 'script', 'couple', 'funny', 'actors.Just', 'side', 'note', 'curious', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'differs', 'fact', 'UK', 'trailers', 'are', 'included', '3', 'coun', '3', 'more', 'commentaries', 'are', 'included']",Shaun of the Dead

The comedy is not really slapstick or in-your-face jokes but more of an understated type of humor, which is especially effective in this setting.The plot revolves around Shaun, who when we meet him is dealing with the problem of juggling time between his girlfriend and his best friend, who is somehwat of a- well- loser. One thing this movie does very well is establish character, so that during the movie you really get to know and identify with them. Shaun is portrayed as a sort of Avergae Joe or everyman, who shuffles back and forth from his ""flat"" (as they say in England) to his menial job. The idea that a poor slob like Shaun would end up having to save the world from the undead is the basic premise, and irony, of the film. The funniest moments come when Shaun goes about the mundane tasks of his life, oblivious to the horror around him (people dropping over dead, bloodstains in the shop he enters, etc.) The movie is brilliantly written, and all of the actors do a wonderful job at making the humor work.I would not call this a parody of horror movies, as there is some gore and violence; it works on many levels and cannot be easily pigeonholed. It sort of transcends a genre, which to me is a sign of a great movie.One of the most originial, intelligently written, and best acted movies I have seen lately.

It was slow paced, NOT funny, boring, had characters you really hate and are unlike-able, and just made you want to puke. The acting wasn't too bad, but the rest was. I can only remember one funny bit, and it wasn't even that funny. It's a horrible rip-off of 'Dawn of the Dead.'This movie does not deserve 4 1/2 stars. Awsome movies like The Evil Dead trilogy deserve 4 1/2 stars, even five. But this, no way.

The gritty survival, the black humor, the gory deaths...what's not to love?And among zombie movies, 'Shaun of the Dead' stands out from the shambling, rotting crowd.It's funny, it's got characters that you can identify with, it's funny, it's cleverly written, it's funny, it's scary, it's funny, it has surprising depth...and did I mention that it's funny?'Shaun of the Dead' does a neat trick - it follows the conventions and tropes of the zombie movie almost perfectly, at the same time as it parodies those conventions. It's a movie in nearly pitch-perfect balance of comedy and drama, never taking itself too seriously, but never going off the deep end for laughs. It can scare you, it can make you laugh, it can gross you out, and it can make you care about the people in it.The titular Shaun is one of those people, a very average person having a bad day, who is completely shocked to find himself in the middle of the zombie (don't use the zed-word!) apocalypse in suburban London. His girlfriend has dumped him and his mother is married to a man who he can't connect with and his friend Ed doesn't bring much to the table other than a pretty good impression of a movie orangutan. In other words, Shaun is in every way an ordinary person who is thrust into an extraordinary situation when the dead begin to rise.This is where the clever parts come in. The advent of the undead (which the audience knows is coming, of course) is done with great subtlety and worked into Shaun's story well. The fact that he barely notices as the evidence of the creeping horde mounts just adds to both the scares and the laughs. Several running jokes, physical comedy, and lots of funny side trips await as the story progresses.The point is that zombie movies, for many like me, are something of a guilty pleasure.

841207,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002MJT0I,Robert Moore,"[7, 7]","As one might expect, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a parodic remake of the classic George Romero film DAWN OF THE DEAD.  It pays frequent homage to the latter film through a host of direct references as well as its general subject matter (for instance, much of the ""news"" as read by the television presenters are lifted nearly word for word from Romero's script).  There differences are, however, marked.  Instead of an American location, this film is set in London.  And instead of holing up in a house to fight it out against the zombies, our heroes travel to a local pub.Although I thoroughly enjoyed this film, there is no question that not everyone finds this film that funny.  I'm not sure why that is, but I thought it would be fun to bat around some theories about why the reactions have been so diverse.  This is an important exercise for prospective viewers.  Are you more likely to side with those who find this to be a highly effective and funny farce or those who simply don't find anything funny at all?  So here are my speculations:First, I think some of those who do not like the movie failed to realize that this is an English comedy, with a very low-key, subdued approach to the story.  Before going to see this, I think a prospective viewer should answer is whether or not they enjoy MONTY PYTHON, Hugh Grant, THE OFFICE, and other British comic productions.  If the answer is ""Yes"" there is a high degree of probability that you will enjoy this one.  If the answer is ""Absolutely not!"" then you will almost certainly dislike this one.Second, I think some people, hearing the basic premise, imagine that this is going to be a bit like SCARY MOVIE or some other such parody of a genre.  I know for a fact that the couple sitting behind me in the viewing I went to had expectations along these lines.  They were expecting more out and out farce, a more frenetic pace, and far more jokes and cartoonish humor.  But because SHAUN OF THE DEAD is more deliberately paced, allows the absurd tale to unfold gradually, and the jokes rationed out more gradually, they were truly upset.I love British humor so I definitely fall more into the class of people apt to enjoy this.  I loved the pacing and subdued reactions of the main characters.  I loved, for instance, a pair of scenes that are allowed to unfold rather slowly.  The first occurs rather early in the movie when Shaun leaves his apartment and out of sheer habit walks across the street and down the sidewalk to the local corner store where he buys a couple of items.  The very same path is followed the next morning, with Shaun without thinking (almost zombie-like?) covers the same path to the store, utterly unaware of how dramatically everything has changed, of all the people he had seen the day before who had been transformed into zombies or been killed.  They were superbly executed scenes, and it is hard to imagine any American studio allowing a scene in a zombie comedy film to unfold so nicely.There are many wonderful scenes in the film, some very short and some a bit longer.  I loved, for instance, the store employee who interrupted a meeting to accept a call on his cell phone.  Or the extraordinary scene later in the film when, to get through a group of zombies, the group of friends mimic the behavior of zombies in order to get past them.  Their rehearsing their imitations of zombies was one of the best scenes in the film.  Bill Nighy, who pretty much stole the show (despite being part of an ensemble cast) in LOVE ACTUALLY as the burned out rock musician, is in a number of nice moments in a regretfully small part.I really loved the great teamwork between stars Simon Pegg and David Frost.  Both had worked together before on TV in SPACED, and Pegg co-wrote the screenplay with director Edgar Wright, also of SPACED.  The cast as a whole is quite strong, though I did find the character of David to be just a tad too irritating.All in all, I really had a great time seeing this one and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys British humor.  But if overly broad, in-your-face American style farce along the lines of SCARY MOVIE is what you want, you'd better skip this one.",5,A superb British parody of DAWN OF THE DEAD,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,4171,"['one', 'might', 'expect', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'parodic', 'remake', 'classic', 'George', 'Romero', 'film', 'DAWN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'frequent', 'homage', 'latter', 'film', 'host', 'direct', 'references', 'as', 'well', 'general', 'subject', 'matter', 'instance', 'much', 'news', 'read', 'television', 'presenters', 'are', 'lifted', 'nearly', 'word', 'word', 'Romero', 'script', 'differences', 'are', 'however', 'marked', 'Instead', 'American', 'location', 'film', 'set', 'London', 'instead', 'holing', 'up', 'house', 'fight', 'out', 'zombies', 'heroes', 'travel', 'local', 'pub.Although', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'question', 'not', 'everyone', 'film', 'funny', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'bat', 'around', 'theories', 'why', 'reactions', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'diverse', 'important', 'exercise', 'prospective', 'viewers', 'Are', 'more', 'likely', 'side', 'who', 'find', 'be', 'highly', 'effective', 'funny', 'farce', 'who', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'funny', 'So', 'here', 'are', 'speculations', 'First', 'think', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'movie', 'failed', 'realize', 'English', 'comedy', 'very', 'low-key', 'subdued', 'approach', 'story', 'going', 'see', 'think', 'prospective', 'viewer', 'should', 'answer', 'not', 'enjoy', 'MONTY', 'PYTHON', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'THE', 'OFFICE', 'other', 'British', 'comic', 'productions', 'answer', 'Yes', 'high', 'degree', 'probability', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'answer', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'then', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'dislike', 'one.Second', 'think', 'people', 'hearing', 'basic', 'premise', 'imagine', 'going', 'be', 'bit', 'SCARY', 'MOVIE', 'other', 'such', 'parody', 'genre', 'know', 'fact', 'couple', 'sitting', 'viewing', 'went', 'had', 'expectations', 'lines', 'were', 'expecting', 'more', 'farce', 'more', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'far', 'more', 'jokes', 'cartoonish', 'humor', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'more', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'absurd', 'tale', 'unfold', 'gradually', 'jokes', 'rationed', 'out', 'more', 'gradually', 'were', 'truly', 'upset.I', 'British', 'humor', 'definitely', 'fall', 'more', 'class', 'people', 'apt', 'enjoy', 'loved', 'pacing', 'subdued', 'reactions', 'main', 'characters', 'loved', 'instance', 'pair', 'scenes', 'are', 'allowed', 'unfold', 'rather', 'slowly', 'first', 'rather', 'early', 'movie', 'when', 'Shaun', 'apartment', 'sheer', 'habit', 'walks', 'street', 'sidewalk', 'local', 'corner', 'store', 'where', 'couple', 'items', 'very', 'same', 'path', 'followed', 'next', 'morning', 'Shaun', 'thinking', 'almost', 'zombie-like', 'same', 'path', 'store', 'utterly', 'unaware', 'how', 'dramatically', 'everything', 'changed', 'people', 'had', 'seen', 'day', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'transformed', 'zombies', 'been', 'killed', 'were', 'superbly', 'executed', 'scenes', 'hard', 'imagine', 'American', 'studio', 'allowing', 'scene', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'film', 'unfold', 'so', 'nicely.There', 'are', 'many', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'film', 'very', 'short', 'bit', 'longer', 'loved', 'instance', 'store', 'employee', 'who', 'interrupted', 'meeting', 'accept', 'call', 'cell', 'phone', 'extraordinary', 'scene', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'get', 'group', 'zombies', 'group', 'friends', 'mimic', 'behavior', 'zombies', 'order', 'get', 'past', 'rehearsing', 'imitations', 'zombies', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'show', 'being', 'part', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'LOVE', 'ACTUALLY', 'burned', 'out', 'rock', 'musician', 'number', 'nice', 'moments', 'regretfully', 'small', 'part.I', 'really', 'loved', 'great', 'teamwork', 'stars', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'David', 'Frost', 'Both', 'had', 'worked', 'together', 'TV', 'SPACED', 'Pegg', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'also', 'SPACED', 'cast', 'whole', 'quite', 'strong', 'did', 'find', 'character', 'David', 'be', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'irritating.All', 'really', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'seeing', 'one', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'British', 'humor', 'overly', 'broad', 'in-your-face', 'American', 'style', 'farce', 'lines', 'SCARY', 'MOVIE', 'what', 'want', ""'d"", 'better', 'skip', 'one']",Shaun of the Dead

Little does he know after a while that zombies are roaming the streets of London and they are after Shaun and his friends and family, killing everyone in their paths. If Shaun doesn't destroy them, they'd kill every last one of them. Shaun only needs to find a way to fight back in funny ways. One of my favorite scenes is where they {Shaun and his friend} try to figure out what to throw at a female zombie that is in their yard. They try records, cricket bats, and all kinds of other things. That's already pretty much how things are with the rest of the movie and the plot is easy.

841218,A3AKPY4LXIC24O,B0002MJT0I,Ryan Costantino,"[4, 5]","Shaun of the Dead is one of the best homages to Horror films I've ever seen.  Hilarious, bloody, and extremely well written; Shaun of the Dead is executed with blistering gusto and loving affection for the Horror genre.  Tribute is given in particular to the films of George Romero (um, just look at the title folks) and Sam Raimi(extreme close-up/quickshot, shovel to the head, ""Ash is feeling a little bit under the weather"").Shaun (played by Simon Pegg in one of 2004's breakout performances) is an affable loser, stuck in a dead end job with a lovelife on the rocks.  His only constant comforts are his unemployed couch potato/stoner friend Ed and drinks at his favorite pub, The Winchester.  After his girlfriend dumps him Shaun goes on an all night bender with Ed, never noticing the somewhat strange behavior some of the townsfolk are exhibiting.The next morning Shaun wakes up to one hell of a hangover and a world overrun by the walking dead.  Although it takes him a while to realize it.  This movie is so good because so many scenes are executed with dead on brilliance and near perfect comic timing.  That's one thing the Brits will always have over us Yanks, they're damn funny people.What follows is a harrowing and hilarious sequence of events as Shaun is suddenly thrust into the position of leader.  Whether he's using zombie mimicry as urban camouflage or wielding a cricket bat as a bludgeon, Shaun gets the job done.Shaun of the Dead is an amazing film, a cult hit for the new millenia. Its uncanny blending of Horror affinity (with some quite resplendent gore) and romantic comedy is a bright, shining glimmer of hope for the Horror genre. So get your Horror loving friends together and sit back for one damn fine show.P.S. The DVD is packed with tons of extras so make sure you check 'em out when you're done watching.",5,"""We're coming to get you Barbara!""",1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,1840,"['Shaun', 'Dead', 'one', 'best', 'homages', 'Horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Hilarious', 'bloody', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'executed', 'blistering', 'gusto', 'loving', 'affection', 'Horror', 'genre', 'Tribute', 'given', 'particular', 'films', 'George', 'Romero', 'um', 'just', 'look', 'title', 'folks', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'extreme', 'close-up/quickshot', 'shovel', 'head', 'Ash', 'feeling', 'little', 'bit', 'weather', '.Shaun', 'played', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'one', '2004', 'breakout', 'performances', 'affable', 'loser', 'stuck', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'lovelife', 'rocks', 'only', 'constant', 'comforts', 'are', 'unemployed', 'couch', 'potato/stoner', 'friend', 'Ed', 'drinks', 'favorite', 'pub', 'Winchester', 'girlfriend', 'Shaun', 'night', 'bender', 'Ed', 'never', 'noticing', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'behavior', 'townsfolk', 'are', 'exhibiting.The', 'next', 'morning', 'Shaun', 'up', 'one', 'hell', 'hangover', 'world', 'overrun', 'walking', 'dead', 'while', 'realize', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'executed', 'dead', 'brilliance', 'perfect', 'comic', 'timing', 'one', 'thing', 'Brits', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'over', 'Yanks', ""'re"", 'damn', 'funny', 'people.What', 'harrowing', 'hilarious', 'sequence', 'events', 'Shaun', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'position', 'leader', 'using', 'zombie', 'mimicry', 'urban', 'camouflage', 'wielding', 'cricket', 'bat', 'bludgeon', 'Shaun', 'job', 'done.Shaun', 'Dead', 'amazing', 'film', 'cult', 'hit', 'new', 'millenia', 'uncanny', 'blending', 'Horror', 'affinity', 'quite', 'resplendent', 'gore', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'bright', 'shining', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'Horror', 'genre', 'get', 'Horror', 'loving', 'together', 'sit', 'back', 'one', 'damn', 'fine', 'show.P.S', 'DVD', 'packed', 'tons', 'extras', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'watching']",Shaun of the Dead

I was definitely looking forward to a film satirizing the zombie flick, namely Shaun of The Dead.  First of all, I'm not a big fan of satire films that use puns of the films they're poking fun at as their titles.  Whether it be Shaun of the Dead or Night of The Living Bread, it just comes across to in-your-face &quot;this is supposed to be funny&quot;.I enjoyed the first half or so of the Shaun of The Dead.  I thought the gags were funny, like the false alarms when you're thinking 'okay, this is when the dead start to walk' and it doesn't happen.  Then when it does start to happen, it's played off as something normal happening, until the very end of the scene.  The humour in the film was funny.  I didn't laugh out loud, but I enjoyed it.It wasn't until the survivors make their way to their fortress/sanctuary, Shaun's favorite pub, that the film goes downhill for me.  It just gets too dark and depressing and very sad.  I just don't see the humor in killing someone you love or care about.  I know that part wasn't supposed to be humorous, but because its such a huge downer, the film doesn't recover.I'd recommend renting this film first just to see if you like it.

841226,A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,B0002MJT0I,Scooter McGavin,"[1, 3]","So what would happen if you replaced the hero of a zombie movie with a bubbling slacker?  Well if you are British, you get Shaun of the Dead.  The movie starts out following Shaun around his mundane life.  He's still working at a computer store.  He still sits in front of the TV flipping channels with his buddy Ed, who is a bigger loser than Shaun is.  But his world comes crashing down when his girlfriend dumps him.  Oh and the whole city is being turned into zombies, not that Shaun or Ed even notice.  That's until Ed notices a weird girl hanging out in their garden.  This gives Shaun the idea on how to get his girlfriend back, sweep her off her feet and take her to safety.  But Shaun and Ed are no Will Smith and Bruce Willis so hilarity ensues.The major problem with the movie is that their too many spots in the movie where the scenes are not funny or scary.  With a movie that mixes humor with gore, there should be a least one going on at all time.  Another problem with the movie is that there is some things that are lost in the translation as it is a British film.  While I was watching it, I wondered out load, ""Why would Shaun have a paddle in his shed and why would he grab that?""  Someone then pointed out that it was a cricket bat.  And there were a few places where the British slang just went over of my head.The DVD extras include the usual trailer, documentaries (extremely boring), deleted and extended scenes (good choice taking these out), and blooper reel.  One very inventive feature was the inclusion of comics that plugs so holes in the story.  No if only every movie did this.  Also, during the film, Shaun and Ed flip through the TV pretty quickly, so in the extra they show extended versions of what they flipped past including a interview with Coldplay who lost some of their members to the zombies and what looks to be the British version of Jerry Springer.With everything that had be popular oversees, I predicted we will get an Americanized version of Shaun of the Dead (spelled Shawn instead) within five years with Stifler as Shawn, Jack Black as Ed, Kate Bosworth as Liz, the nerdy dude from The O.C. as David, some token hot chick as Dianne, and Burt Reynolds as Phillip.

841228,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0002MJT0I,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a hilarious romp through the cliches of zombie movies, slackerdom, and romantic comedies.  Tossing the genres of horror and comedy into a blender and getting the mix just right, ""Shaun"" is one of those movies that earns the compliment, ""destined to be a cult classic.""The titular Shaun (Simon Pegg) has an intriguing ambition -- for nothing to change whatsoever.  The outset of the movie sees Shaun's ambition being challenged, as reality checks in to tell him that he's not doing all that well.  29 years old and in a job he can't muster up the passion for to hate (mid-management at an electronics store), Shaun also learns that his wonderful girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) wants him to grow up, or else.  And his responsible flatmate wants him to kick out his slacker roomie, Ed (Nick Frost, in a hilarious performance) due to his flatulence and his inability to even make money dealing drugs.Single, rejected and dejected, Shaun retreats to the only place in the world that makes sense -- his home away from home, the pub entitled ""the Winchester.""  On the way home, Shaun and Ed nearly bump into several staggering drunks . . . or are they drunks?  One of the most hilarious running gags in the movie is the amazing ability of our hero to fail to realize that London is beset by zombies!  A long, uncut scene of Shaun walking to the corner market for a morning beverage, nearly running into the arms of about fifteen zombies, is a masterpiece.But soon, even our dense hero realizes that strange things are afoot.  Ed and Shaun come face to face with a few zombies, and quickly learn the basic rules of fighting the undead.  First, the undead are rather slow (""Shaun"" has several hilarious lines of dialogue as humans bicker over trivial matters while the undead shamble ever-so-slowly towards them -- well, maybe not trivia -- if you're going to use your record collection as zombie-decapitating missiles, wouldn't you start with Sade and save the New Order?).  Second, the head is the only really vulnerable spot.  Third, don't let them bite you, under any circumstances.Ed and Shaun are assembling the stereotypical rag-tag bunch of supporting characters, including Liz, a couple of friends with hidden agendas, and Shaun's beloved mom and hated step-dad.  As you can expect, some of these characters are more or less expendable.  ""Shaun"" has some yucks with these cliches as well -- watch for a hilarious scene as one rag-tag bunch of survivors runs into another mirror-image rag-tag bunch of survivors heading in the opposite direction.Shaun leads his troupe to the only bastion of common sense and reality left in his world - the beloved Winchester.  The flight to the pub and the defense of the pub give the filmmakers several great opportunities for humor and scares, and they get high marks for both.  A brief epilogue is both hilarious and somewhat poignant, as one is shown the true value of a friendship that can survive even the biggest obstacles.We are going through a strange revival of the zombie movie these days.

Only a few movies have been able to marry both of them successfully with one antoehr (like Raimi's Evil Dead series for instance). Well, our generation finally has its great horror comedy. And it's called Shaun of The Dead.Shaun is a boring guy who's boring life has lost all of its charms. Now, on the night he breaks up with his girlfriend, he'll be faced with the greatest battle of his life. London is infested with zombies and it will be up to him to save his mother and his ex-girlfriend from this terrible tragedy.This one is a laugh-a-minute marathon that ends up being pretty scary in its last half hour. As Shaun makes it across London to get from one place to the other, the movie also juxtaposes the fact that we, in real life, have also become zombies. At one point, Shaun is looking at some of the people sitting on a bus with him, and they look exactly like what the zombies are about to look like.The movie is perfectly cast and the plot brightly written. The balance between horror and comedy is realized in a way that is worthy of all the praise it can get. Neither horror or comedy dominates here.I'm so happy that this British flick was able to achieve the things it did. Let it be a lesson to filmmakers in North America; remakes aren't original.

841251,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B0002MJT0I,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[6, 7]","Zombie films have made sort of a mini-comeback in recent years, and each amd every one of them is terrible.  These films either have running, jumping and galloping zombies(28 Days Later), crappy Matrix-like techno zombies(Resident Evil, House Of The Dead) or just flat out rape Romero's good name(Dawn Of The Dead remake).  We haven't had a really good zombie movie since O""Bannon's Return Of The Living Dead in 1984.  That's a long time.  Well, Dead Alive was cool too.  Ok fine, Cemetery Man was also good.  Shaun Of The Dead is British comedy's take on Romero, and it's actually very good.  The film is quite funny with some Python-esque moments, but is also able to screetch to a halt to deliver a few scenes that might actually get you a little misty eyed(!).  I have seen very few movies that can do that.  The comedy is hit and miss depending on your sense of humor.  There's some very clever jokes, but a few Dude, Where's My Car? kind as well.  The film never gets very scary, but the film makers obviously know the classic zombie flicks and like them, unlike Paul Anderson or Zack Snyder.  Most newer zombie flicks like to steal ideas and sometimes entire scenes from Romero's films to push their story.  I guess they figure the general public will never catch on, and they won't.  Us zombie fanatics know better.  Shaun also does this, but in the same way Mel Brooks does in his films-as a spoof/homage.  Granted, most people won't pick up on these either, but it shows the film maker's knowledge and respect for the film's roots.  This movie is bound by the R rating which keeps it from being an all out gorefest like the classic zombie films, but it pushes the gore to it's limit.  In fact, there's one scene that could have come straight from a Romero or Fulci film that I'm shocked made it by the censors.  Especially when we're talking about England here.  There are two zombie films playing in the theaters as of now.  DO NOT feed that rotten wannabe RE franchise and check out Shaun.

No copping out, ""good enough for those boobs in the audience"" sensibilities at work here.  Bravo.  When people I respect started asking me if I'd seen this film, I knew it had to be special, but finding it was tougher than I thought.  That's a pity because ""Shaun of the Dead"" eclipses so many slacker comedies on both sides of the Atlantic by uniting both a watchable cast and a wacky visual style that more people should see it.  The story?  A likeable loser finds himself battling the undead.  That's it.  There's some trifling about his mother and girlfriend, but it's mostly just an excuse to have Shaun -- who looks like a baby-faced version of Steve Buscemi -- to get out of his apartment.  The frenetic comedy works quite well in the first half of the film, as we come to understand the irony that while Shaun technically is alive, he exists in a kind of living dead state due to his inability to take charge of his life.  Holding him back are his ne-er-do-well childhood pal, Ed (Nick Frost), and his quandary over his on-again, off-again romance with spunky Liz (Kate Ashfield).  Toss in an overbearing stepdad, a gaggle of smartass, teenaged employees, and an over-the-hill Harry Potter lookalike (Dylan Moran), and the result is a winning combination of satire and scares, even if the second half takes itself just a little too seriously as an actual zombie movie.

No one would ever want to come see the film in the theater, so I made all my friends watch it with me when it was thankfully released on DVD.When the film began I had fairly low expectations, figuring I'd just wasted $20 - but was I wrong?!  Yes!  Shaun of the Dead is the epitome of British humor - self effacing, subtle, and hilarious!Just a quick note:  If you think that SOTD is going to be an all out gore-fest, you're mistaken.  There are a handful of 'bloody' instances but they are quite brief.  There are some shocking (scary) moments but it isn't all that scary simply because the film takes place in the DAYTIME, which in itself is rather amusing.In short, SOTD is a zombie horror romantic comedy.  Several snippets you will need to rewind because of the occassionally thick British accents, but keep an ear out for the subtle humor.Make sure you watch the extras, too - it will answer some questions you may have during the film.Enjoy!

However, this movie seemed sort of forgotten and I did not run across it again until yesterday I rented it on a whim.It tells the story of Shaun (Simon Pegg) as he begins possibly the worst 24 hours of his life. His girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) has dumped him, and you can't blame her as they never spend quality time together.  Why?  Because Shaun's roomie and childhood friend Ed (Nick Frost), is in the way. All the two pals want to do seemingly is to hang out at The Winchester Pub getting drunk. Also, Shaun's other room mate, Peter (Peter Serafinowicz)is getting fed up with Ed because he is a slacker, brings in no money, contributes nothing toward cleaning up, and is generally an irresponsible, farting slob.So, after Liz dumps Shaun, he and Ed go to the Winchester, and pretty much close it down, unaware as they trudge through their hangovers that zombies have been roaming the streets.From the point at which they realize what is happening, Shaun, who is fed up with being a loser, takes the initiative to get himself and loved ones out of this mess. Naturally, they hole up at the Winchester.What sets this movie apart is that it is hilarious. The absurdity in the humor goes places that this type of movie never goes, and yet, it manages somehow to seem very natural. After all, what would you do in that situation?!The characters are lovable, funny, and have a realness to them that generally doesn't exist in any horror movie, and certainly  not a comedy-horror. They all play off one another so well that you truly feel like they are these characters, and not just actors playing them. They have some depth to them, and while I am not claiming that they are at the level of characters in some ""serious"" movie, they go beyond the norm of this genre in making the heroes come to life...or death.Even if you aren't some film maker wannabe, this is a zombie movie everyone can enjoy. This isn't a B-movie, though it pokes fun at them without losing itself in the satire as ""Scary Movie"" type movies have done. Neither does it lose itself in the trite formulas of horror movies. While some of it is predictable, the characters and story line show that a little more effort was put forth.This is definitely in the Top Five Horror Movies of all time, and probably one of the Top Ten Comedies of all time for me.",5,Zombies In England,1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,2766,"['When', 'think', 'people', 'watch', 'zombie', 'movies', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'are', 'actually', 'fans', 'think', 'would-be', 'film', 'maker', 'use', 'words', 'poignant', 'glorious', 'genius', 'lot', 'when', 'describing', 'obscure', 'films', 'are', 'as', 'interesting', 'big', 'toe.The', 'movie', 'trailer', 'initially', 'intrigued', 'most', 'movies', ""n't"", 'show', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'make', 'feel', 'cheated', 'once', 'watch', 'However', 'movie', 'seemed', 'sort', 'forgotten', 'did', 'not', 'run', 'again', 'yesterday', 'rented', 'whim.It', 'story', 'Shaun', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'possibly', 'worst', '24', 'hours', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'Liz', 'Kate', 'Ashfield', 'dumped', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'never', 'spend', 'quality', 'time', 'together', 'Why', 'Shaun', 'roomie', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Ed', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'way', 'two', 'pals', 'want', 'do', 'seemingly', 'hang', 'out', 'Winchester', 'Pub', 'getting', 'drunk', 'Also', 'Shaun', 'other', 'room', 'mate', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'Serafinowicz', 'getting', 'fed', 'up', 'Ed', 'slacker', 'money', 'nothing', 'cleaning', 'up', 'generally', 'irresponsible', 'farting', 'slob.So', 'Liz', 'dumps', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'go', 'Winchester', 'pretty', 'much', 'close', 'down', 'unaware', 'trudge', 'hangovers', 'zombies', 'have', 'been', 'roaming', 'streets.From', 'point', 'realize', 'what', 'happening', 'Shaun', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'being', 'loser', 'initiative', 'get', 'loved', 'ones', 'mess', 'Naturally', 'hole', 'up', 'Winchester.What', 'movie', 'apart', 'hilarious', 'absurdity', 'humor', 'places', 'type', 'movie', 'never', 'yet', 'somehow', 'seem', 'very', 'natural', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'characters', 'are', 'lovable', 'funny', 'have', 'realness', 'generally', ""n't"", 'exist', 'horror', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'comedy-horror', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'so', 'well', 'truly', 'feel', 'are', 'characters', 'not', 'just', 'actors', 'playing', 'have', 'depth', 'am', 'not', 'claiming', 'are', 'level', 'characters', 'serious', 'movie', 'go', 'norm', 'genre', 'making', 'heroes', 'come', 'life', 'death.Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'film', 'maker', 'wannabe', 'zombie', 'movie', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy', ""n't"", 'B-movie', 'fun', 'losing', 'satire', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'type', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'lose', 'trite', 'formulas', 'horror', 'movies', 'predictable', 'characters', 'story', 'line', 'show', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'forth.This', 'definitely', 'Top', 'Five', 'Horror', 'Movies', 'time', 'probably', 'one', 'Top', 'Ten', 'Comedies', 'time']",Shaun of the Dead

Hindsight is always 20/20, but if I had to go back in time I would have skipped the Dawn of the Dead remake and just watched this one.  It manages to keep some of the thematic elements of the Romero trilogy while adding a bit of smart humor.  Zombification in this film has a physiological reason (which is hidden thanks to some well-timed channel-flipping) but on a subtle note zombification is a result of everyday routine -- societal norms that are pushed upon us and to which we conform.  The ""zombie"" by itself is slow, dumb, predictable and thus easy to kill.  They are only dangerous in large groups.  The same is true with any ideal to which one is tempted to conform.  One person usually cannot sway another individual, but a massive number of people doing one thing or thinking one thing may easily convince the nonconforming individual.  The so-called ""Dawn of the Dead remake"" completely misses this element of the zombie ethos by making fast zombies.  Shaun of the Dead, on the other hand, delivers on all levels: theme, gore, action and plot.  This is a wonderful British homage to Romero that just happens to be pretty funny.As for the DVD, the commentaries and interviews are some of the best out there.

One good thing about this movie, is that you do not have to watch the real ""Dawn of the Dead"" in order to actually enjoy the spoof, ""Shaun of the Dead.""Storyline- The storyline of Shaun of the Dead is basically about a guy named Shaun and his friend who are practically fed up with life. He cant really be bothered to do anything along with his friend Ed. The only real fun they can entertain themselves with is either by playing video games or annoying the living daylights out of their roomate Pete.When they find out that they're are zombies on the loose and everytime someone is bit by a zombie, h@ll breaks out for them. They cant think of a plan to get out of the situation and they end up like wild chickens with their heads popped off, mentally not literally. It is up to them to stop the Zombies and get out of town, fast.What i liked about the storyline is that it is so simple and yet hilarious. Director Edgar Wright does a wonderful job of sticking to the story as well as every so often resorting to the real version ""Dawn of the Dead.""Great job guys in terms of storyline!Acting/script- The acting/script, i thought, was actually better then the real storyline. The words and phrases that each character comes out with are just priceless and another good thing about the characters is that each one has the same personality. This usually isn't good for movie, but when your talking about a spoof like this, its hilarious and great. The actors do a really great job on letting the world know that they are living a dull life and are just fed up with it. I really don't think that they could have chosen better actors to be honest for the role of Shaun, Ed and Pete once again because of their great emotions and acting skills! (Well at least in this movie their acting skills are great, i have to admit, i had never even heard of any of them before this movie came out:)Once again, great job!Other/conclusion- There really isn't that much more to the movie besides the hilarious lines, acting and the storyline. There isn't much action, nore special effects and it isn't really suspensful. I know your probobly thinking, then why go see it? But its the comedy that make this movie great and definetely worth seeing. If your one of those people who don't like characters cursing their heads off (which is one of the reasons why this movie is rated ""R"" besides SOME gruesome scenes), then you might want to stay away from it and not watch it, but now a days no one cares HOW much characters swear/curse in movies which is why i think the director added quite a few of those words in the movie, to show emotion and knowing that the audience won't really care.In conclusion, if your up for a great killer comedy, this is definetely worth renting or even buying from your local movie retailer!",5,The most hilarious film of the year!,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,2871,"['seriousely', 'think', 'most', 'hilarious', 'film', 'year', 'One', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'watch', 'real', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'order', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'spoof', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Storyline-', 'storyline', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'basically', 'guy', 'named', 'Shaun', 'friend', 'who', 'are', 'practically', 'fed', 'up', 'life', 'cant', 'really', 'be', 'bothered', 'do', 'anything', 'friend', 'Ed', 'only', 'real', 'fun', 'can', 'entertain', 'either', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'annoying', 'living', 'daylights', 'roomate', 'Pete.When', 'find', 'out', ""'re"", 'are', 'zombies', 'loose', 'everytime', 'someone', 'bit', 'zombie', 'h', '@', 'll', 'breaks', 'out', 'cant', 'think', 'plan', 'get', 'situation', 'end', 'up', 'wild', 'chickens', 'heads', 'popped', 'off', 'mentally', 'not', 'literally', 'stop', 'Zombies', 'get', 'town', 'fast.What', 'liked', 'storyline', 'so', 'simple', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'Director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'wonderful', 'job', 'sticking', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'often', 'resorting', 'real', 'version', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Great', 'job', 'guys', 'terms', 'storyline', 'Acting/script-', 'acting/script', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'then', 'real', 'storyline', 'words', 'phrases', 'character', 'out', 'are', 'just', 'priceless', 'good', 'thing', 'characters', 'one', 'same', 'personality', 'usually', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'talking', 'spoof', 'hilarious', 'great', 'actors', 'do', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'letting', 'world', 'know', 'are', 'living', 'dull', 'life', 'are', 'just', 'fed', 'up', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'better', 'actors', 'be', 'honest', 'role', 'Shaun', 'Ed', 'Pete', 'once', 'again', 'great', 'emotions', 'acting', 'skills', 'Well', 'least', 'movie', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'great', 'i', 'have', 'admit', 'i', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'movie', 'came', 'Once', 'again', 'great', 'job', 'Other/conclusion-', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'lines', 'acting', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'much', 'action', 'nore', 'special', 'effects', ""n't"", 'really', 'suspensful', 'know', 'probobly', 'thinking', 'then', 'why', 'go', 'see', 'comedy', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'definetely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'characters', 'cursing', 'heads', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'SOME', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'stay', 'away', 'not', 'watch', 'now', 'days', 'one', 'HOW', 'much', 'characters', 'swear/curse', 'movies', 'why', 'i', 'think', 'director', 'added', 'quite', 'few', 'words', 'movie', 'show', 'emotion', 'knowing', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'care.In', 'conclusion', 'up', 'great', 'killer', 'comedy', 'definetely', 'worth', 'renting', 'even', 'buying', 'local', 'movie', 'retailer']",Shaun of the Dead

Thats just one of the things that make ""Shaun of the Dead"" so funny, these guys don't have a clue as to whats going on.When Shaun and his friend Ed [Nick Frost] realize that everyone is running for their lives they do the only thing they know that can save them; Take out the bad music records in their collection of records and use them as frisbees to fend off the walking dead.What makes this brilliant is that even though they want to survive, Shaun just cant seem to want to part with his favorite records. But everyonce in a while he manages to part with one, ""The Batman soundtrack? Chuck it....""When they realize that the frisbee idea might not work they resort to getting down and dirty with a shovel and a cricket bat as clubs.The acting and humor in ""Shaun of the Dead"" is very entertaining and even sincere in some places. Anyone who's seen it should notice how dark the movie gets in the last half hour, going from fun, suspensful times as the people who are still alive are running away from the zombies, to, ""You know, they just might not make it...""Not only does Shaun have to survive zombies, he also has to get his girlfriend to forgive him for not turning his life around, and also has to look out for his mother, who's husband just happened to have been bitten by a zombie. So many twists and funy moments, too many to name...One of them though that needs mentioning is how Ed and Shaun go over in their minds on who to save and where to go as long as they know where the exits are and where they can smoke. The answer? The winchester pub that they always go to, and ironically the place where Shaun's girlfriend despises to go.That is just some of the things that you can expect from ""Shaun of the Dead,"" A bunch of slackers actually thinking on their feet for a change, running around in a room mate's car that they stole after the room mate turns into a zombie himself, to impersonating chimpanzees in the Winchester pub.I definately reccomend this movie if anyone wants a good laugh....",4,Funny all the way through......,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,2375,"['Shaun', 'Dead', 'combines', 'British', 'humor', 'zombie', 'gore', 'slacker', 'routine', 'life', 'unknowing', 'entire', 'world', 'being', 'taken', 'over', 'walking', 'dead', '[', 'Simon', 'Pegg', ']', 'life', 'so', 'routine', 'nearly', 'sleepwalks', 'nearest', 'grocery', 'store', 'morning', 'not', 'knowing', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'odd', 'people', 'stumbling', 'moaning', 'Thats', 'just', 'one', 'things', 'make', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'so', 'funny', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'whats', 'going', 'on.When', 'Shaun', 'friend', 'Ed', '[', 'Nick', 'Frost', ']', 'realize', 'everyone', 'running', 'lives', 'do', 'only', 'thing', 'know', 'can', 'save', 'Take', 'out', 'bad', 'music', 'records', 'collection', 'records', 'use', 'frisbees', 'fend', 'off', 'walking', 'dead.What', 'brilliant', 'even', 'want', 'survive', 'Shaun', 'just', 'cant', 'seem', 'want', 'part', 'favorite', 'records', 'everyonce', 'while', 'part', 'one', 'Batman', 'soundtrack', 'Chuck', 'When', 'realize', 'frisbee', 'idea', 'might', 'not', 'work', 'resort', 'getting', 'down', 'dirty', 'shovel', 'cricket', 'bat', 'clubs.The', 'acting', 'humor', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'very', 'entertaining', 'even', 'sincere', 'places', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'should', 'notice', 'how', 'dark', 'movie', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'going', 'fun', 'suspensful', 'times', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'are', 'running', 'away', 'zombies', 'know', 'just', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'Not', 'only', 'Shaun', 'have', 'survive', 'zombies', 'also', 'get', 'girlfriend', 'forgive', 'not', 'turning', 'life', 'around', 'also', 'look', 'out', 'mother', 'who', 'husband', 'just', 'happened', 'have', 'been', 'bitten', 'zombie', 'So', 'many', 'twists', 'funy', 'moments', 'too', 'many', 'name', 'One', 'mentioning', 'how', 'Ed', 'Shaun', 'go', 'minds', 'who', 'save', 'where', 'go', 'as', 'long', 'know', 'where', 'exits', 'are', 'where', 'can', 'smoke', 'answer', 'winchester', 'pub', 'always', 'go', 'ironically', 'place', 'where', 'Shaun', 'girlfriend', 'go.That', 'just', 'things', 'can', 'expect', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'A', 'bunch', 'slackers', 'actually', 'thinking', 'feet', 'change', 'running', 'around', 'room', 'mate', 'car', 'stole', 'room', 'mate', 'zombie', 'impersonating', 'chimpanzees', 'Winchester', 'pub.I', 'definately', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'good', 'laugh']",Shaun of the Dead

News flashes across screens, people acting very wild, un-controlled, rabid, vile, demented. And you know what???Shaun doesn't notice a damn thing, it's take a zombie girl to be in his backyard who gets hit by a shovel for him to realize whats going on.Shaun then has a dilemma at hand, does he stay home and play video games with ED or does he become a man, grab his crickit paddle and go across town and try to rescue his parents and friends from the zombie infested city?He chooses choice B and the fun begins.Now i know what you're thinking........ your thinking i am such a great reviewer yeah i know, oh okay i know what you're thinking about this movie, that this is just another zombie spoof film..well partner your wrong, dead wrong now go in the corner you have a 5 minute timeout.Go i am serious!!!!!!!okay well this is a smart comedy, some jokes you're gonna miss because some part of the comedy happens in the backround.What is so good about this movie is this movie turns from a light hearted comedy to a full fledged horror film towards the end and you actually feel suspense and horror from a movie you thought was going to be a dumb spoof.Yes my friend you must see this movie, it's an actual good movie from the U.K not just tasteless humour like ALI G.(watch now the hatemail flow to my email account from U.K people).The Negatives-yes even a great film like this has some negatives.

It's funny, it's scary, and it's tightly woven.What that last one means is that it has several self-references that you don't notice until you've watched it a few times.  It also refers to other zombie movies.  In the scene selection menu, one of the scenes is called ""Residential Evil"".  This is my favorite part of the movie, where Shaun walks from home to the store and back, NOT NOTICING the zombies around him!  The scene is funny and creepy at the same time.Other references are to 28 Days Later (at the end of the movie) and, of course, Night of the Living Dead.  Use the Zomb-o-Meter if you know even less about zombie horror than I do.The zombie theme is a running gag throughout the movie.  Many of the background characters look like zombies before the zombie plague reaches them!  An important moment is when Shaun removes his job nametag, thus rejecting literal and social zombification.Pay attention to Ed, who represents Shaun's apathy.  As Shaun becomes more dynamic, Ed progresses from mere deadweight and becomes actively obstructive.My only criticism of SotD is that David is presented one-dimensionally.  He shows no real motivation beyond opposing Shaun.There is swearing, and one character gets his guts ripped out, but overall Shaun of the Dead is a good movie.

841273,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0002MJT0I,Tim Janson,"[1, 2]","If the jokes and sight gags came just a bit more rapid paced you'd swear this film would have been made by the Zucker Brothers.  As Airplane skewered Aircraft disaster films and Naked Gun skewered cop dramas, Shaun of the dead is a rousing parody, and yet glorious tribute to zombie films, particularly those of George Romero.This is one of those films that requires 100% attention as there are just as many things going on in the backgound as there are in the foreground and if you don't pay attention, you'll miss some of the very ingenious tips of the hat that director Edgar Wright gives to those movies that he pays tribute to.  Listen to those radio and TV broadcasts playing in the background, keep your eyes on what those zombies are doing way down the street...it's all clever stuff.  I particularly love the radio report blaming an American Spacecrafts return descent as a possible explanation of the zombie phenomena.Shaun takes it's cue mainly from DAwn of the Dead.  Shaun is played by Simon Pegg.  He's a 29 year old electronics store loser.  He's just lost his girlfriend Liz, he's regretting a trip the following day to his mother's house and dealing with his stepfather.  He shares a flat with Ed, a lazy, overweight, crude couch potato whose even a bigger loser than Shaun.  While out to get some goods from the convenience store, Shaun is completely oblivious to the dead bodies and shambling zombies in his neighborhood.  Quite a wonderful skewering of middle America...err...England, just as Romero did in Dawn.Soon Shaun and Ed encounter the first zombies in their back yard and eventually discover you can take them out in similar Romero fashion by destroying the brain.  Thus the pair begins a plan of rescuing Shauns 'mum', his ex Liz, and her friends Dianne and David and taking refuge not in a mall, but in hilarious English style, the local pub!  Along the way the little group of survivors dodges zombies through suburban back yards, arguing amongst themselve and even encounters another group of survivors who match them almost identically as if from Bizarro world.Shaun of the Dead is the best Zombie movie in many years.  Better than both ""28 Days Later"" and the ""Dawn"" remake because of its style, and also because it follows the number one rule of Zombies: Zombies are SLOW and shambling.  They are not sprinters!  Shaun's amusing digs of these two films will certainly not be lost on anyone who's seen them.  Kudos again for Mr. Wright for calling them out.If I have one complaint, it's that the last 3rd of the film is played mostly as a straight zombie horror film and the comedy takes a bit of a back seat.  But the ending does save it as Director right gives one last bow to George Romero by tipping his hat to ""Day of the Dead""The great DVD is loaded with extras including commentary and deleted scenes.

841275,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B0002MJT0I,titania86,"[0, 0]","Shaun and Ed are inseparable best friends that share the same hobbies: playing video games, listening to electro, and frequently drinking at the Winchester Tavern. Shaun's girlfriend Liz is tired of being held back by Shaun and his slacker ways, so she breaks up with him. When he wakes up after trying to drink his sorrow away, he finds the world populated with the walking dead. After resolving to turn his life around, Shaun takes advantage of the apocalypse to take charge and win Liz back. Armed with a cricket bat and a shovel, he and Ed round up their friends and Shaun's parents and seek shelter at the only safe, secure place they know: the Winchester. With everyone depending in Shaun, will he prove to be a hero or just a washed up loser?Shaun of the Dead is the classic story of a slacker turning his life around and becoming a hero during the zombie apocalypse. It's one of my favorite movies of all time because of its perfect balance of horror and comedy with a little splash of romance. I never would have thought that these elements could work so well together, but Edgar Wright's masterpiece of a zombie film proved me wrong. The buildup to the zombie outbreak is simply perfect. It starts off as a typical romantic comedy with a look into a normal day in Shaun's life where no one respects him and he lets his girlfriend down time and time again. The next day, he goes through close to the same routine, except for the people he usually sees on his route to the nearby convenience store are all dead, zombies, or gone. One of the things that makes this film great is the repetition. From the first normal day to the apocalypse day, many of the same things are done and said, but mean wildly different things on the second day than on the first. For example, someone commenting ""You've got red on you"" the first day means a red pen exploded in your pocket, but the second day means your shirt is splattered with blood from bludgeoning zombies to death with a cricket bat. There are quite a few things like this (way too many to write about) that provide many laughs and are also a sign of great writing.Simon Pegg as Shaun and Nick Frost as Ed are a hilarious comedic duo. Shaun is the meek, kind of quiet slacker who lets others push him around. On Z-day, he turns his entire life around and does all the things he has always wanted to do. Ed is the foul mouthed, obnoxious under achiever who makes pretty much everyone uncomfortable around him. He's still annoying and kind of a jerk on Z-day, but he really comes through for his best friend when it matters. They are definitely an unlikely duo to become leaders during the zombie apocalypse, but at the same time are realistic characters.Their friendship is exhibited throughout the film, even when they are in the direst of situations. I know people who would go out of their way to kill zombies as if they were in a video game and pick a random location to hide out that might not work out as well as first thought. Although much of the film is funny, there are a few very emotional and touching scenes that brought me to tears. These moments show that the characters have dimensions deeper than their slacker facades. The ability for such a funny movie to succeed in having heartbreaking, tear inducing scenes is amazing and shows a culmination of writing, acting, and directing.Many zombie films are used as an allegory for social commentary and this one is no different. The opening credits, surprisingly, is where this is most evident, but only on the second viewing. The scene shows many of the people who turn into zombies later in the movie going through their everyday routing: working at mindless, repetitive jobs and doing the same things day after day.

841279,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0002MJT0I,Tom Benton,"[3, 4]","Let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of horror-comedies.  I mean, what are two of the strongest humor emotions?  Fear and happiness.  Horror-comedies mix these two elements, and if done correctly - which is no easy feat - you can have one darn fine movie.  And ""Shaun of the Dead"" is just that.  I've been looking forward to this movie since I first saw it advertised in U.S. theaters, and I can sincerely say that it lived up to the highest of my expectations.Simon Pegg (who has gained some popularity overseas for performing in the British TV show ""Spaced"") stars as Shaun, a 30-year-old Brit who is stock with a crappy job and a crappy stepfather (Bill Nighy), among other things.  Then there's his slacker best friend, Ed (Nick Frost).  When his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumbs Shaun, it looks like his life has taken the final step towards hell.But Shaun is given a chance to win back Liz, as well as fix things up with his mother (Nicola Cunningham) and stepdad.  How?  Simple: he just has to defend them all against a neighborhood full of zombies.I've always been a fan of movies like ""Evil Dead II"", ""Re-Animator"", and George Romero's original ""Dead"" trilogy.  As a fan, I can say that anyone else who liked those movies will love ""Shaun of the Dead"".  The script, by Edgar Wright and star Pegg, knows when to bring in some comedy and when to let loose the horror.  (When it does bring in horror, the casual moviegoer's stomach will no doubt flip - ever seen a man get ripped to pieces right in front of you, while he's still living, and his guts eaten?)The cast is terrific, Pegg especially.  You care about the characters, and the only one who I didn't care about was ... uh ... dealt with.  Edgar Wright manages to make the film look like a comedy when there's something funny going on, but when there's any horror (especially towards the end of the film), his direction becomes quite dark.What can I say?  This is one of the best films of the year, and easily the best horror-comedy in years.  I was entertained throughout the entire film.

841291,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002MJT0I,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Despite the rather corny title, 'Shaun of the Dead' is a funny and often brilliant, even intelligent spoof on horror films, in this case, zombies in particular.  The story is almost the same as George Romero's (or Zack Snyder's) one.  An Englishman Shawn working for an electronical shop wakes up one morning, and finds that everybody is acting weird.  The difference is, however, he does not find a makeshift shelter in shopping center -- but in a pub named 'Winchester' where he goes with his pal Ed who loves TV games.That's it, 'Shaun of the Dead' is filled with British humor, peppered with occasional pop culture references.  It understands the rules of so many zombie films, and twists and uses it for its own purpose to make us laugh.The film, as is the case with intelligent films, works as off-beat comedy.  See one incredibly hilarious scene where Shawn, himself being 'in the weather' because of the last night's booze, walks in the street, not noticing at all that the town has already been full of the zombies roaming.  Among them Shaun keeps on walking, not realizing the emergency around him.Or think about this; 'What do you do when you find a zombie strayed into your garden?'  Shawn thinks the femele zombie is just drunk, or fooling around (why not?) until he and Ed do realize that she is a real thing.The writer/director team is, I was told, behind the British TV show called 'Spaced.'  Unlike these lucky UK viewers, those audiences living outside the country probably may not know the faces of the actors (except Bill Nighy, middle-aged rocker in 'Love Actually'),  But that doesn't matter as long as you love this genre -- horror or spoof.I find the latter half is slightly weak when the film starts to run short of its initial clever tricks.  But the ending, which is quite original, would makes it up for the loss of creative energy that keeps up the entire film several notched higher than usual spoofs.  I don't say it's genius's work, but is often makes us feel like that, especially in the first half.

It justifies the zombie genre while also balancing reality and comedy spectacularly.  Edgar Wright is a fantastic director that was underappreciated for Scott Pilgrim.  All of his films deserve to be owned, watched, and enjoyed.I have nothing bad to say about the film itself, however the last 20 minutes of it feels a little rough.  What I do criticize is its blu-ray release.  U-control is the most annoying feature I have seen in my dvd/blu-ray collecting career.  Nobody wants to watch this film 7 times to receive all the special features.  Put them in block segments and featurettes, instead of creating little pop-ups that play during the movie non-simultaneously.  Not only did Universal fail me in this disc, but Pegg and Wright did as well.  It was an annoying joke to put 3 commentaries on this release.  If you like to watch all the special features to get the most out of your money, Shaun of the Dead will be a big time-waster.  I liked the first commentary, but the remaining two were unnecessary.  Treat your films seriously and provide fans with a blu-ray that enjoyable.  I felt like Edgar Wright provided three commentaries to annoy the blu-ray collectors purposefully.I summed it up before: Great Movie, Tedious Blu-ray.  That's all you need to know if you're going to upgrade to hi-def.  The picture and sound is great, but the features are a drag.  So, if you're only purchasing this disc to watch this excellent film, then for you this is a five star blu-ray release.",4,"Great Movie, Tedious Blu-ray",1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,1541,"['Shaun', 'Dead', 'comedy', 'classic', 'book', 'zombie', 'genre', 'also', 'balancing', 'reality', 'comedy', 'spectacularly', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'fantastic', 'director', 'was', 'underappreciated', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'films', 'deserve', 'be', 'owned', 'watched', 'enjoyed.I', 'have', 'nothing', 'bad', 'say', 'film', 'however', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'little', 'rough', 'What', 'do', 'criticize', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'U-control', 'most', 'annoying', 'feature', 'have', 'seen', 'dvd/blu-ray', 'collecting', 'career', 'Nobody', 'watch', 'film', '7', 'times', 'receive', 'special', 'features', 'Put', 'block', 'segments', 'featurettes', 'instead', 'creating', 'little', 'pop-ups', 'play', 'movie', 'non-simultaneously', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Universal', 'fail', 'disc', 'Pegg', 'Wright', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'annoying', 'joke', 'put', '3', 'commentaries', 'release', 'like', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'get', 'most', 'money', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'will', 'be', 'big', 'time-waster', 'liked', 'first', 'commentary', 'remaining', 'two', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'Treat', 'films', 'seriously', 'provide', 'fans', 'blu-ray', 'enjoyable', 'felt', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'provided', 'three', 'commentaries', 'annoy', 'blu-ray', 'collectors', 'purposefully.I', 'summed', 'up', 'Great', 'Movie', 'Tedious', 'Blu-ray', 'need', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'upgrade', 'hi-def', 'picture', 'sound', 'great', 'features', 'are', 'drag', 'So', ""'re"", 'only', 'purchasing', 'disc', 'watch', 'excellent', 'film', 'then', 'five', 'star', 'blu-ray', 'release']",Shaun of the Dead

How many days would it take for you to realize?  There's a touch of that in the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" (so these two in the graveyard don't listen to the radio?  How many days have the attcks been happening?).  Brilliantly, the filmmakers here realized that the concept of impending doom is just as scary as zombies eating flesh.  Glimpses of zombies casually viewed off in the distance is scary stuff.Besides being a pitch-perfect horror film (there is some serious gore, be warned), it's also very, very funny.  Never does it go lame on us, it's Fawtly Towers, Ab Fab, Monty Python-level funny.  Leave it to the British to concoct such a dry approach to total armageddon.

841298,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0002MJT0I,Wheelchair Assassin,"[3, 4]","If you're tired of the lowest-common-denominator genre films that Hollywood seems to be pumping out at record pace, Shaun of the Dead may be just what you're looking for.  Originally released on the other side of the pond, this English horror-comedy seamlessly blends intense zombie terror and wry humor without ever coming off as forced or condescending.  Shaun of the Dead clearly has a lot of fun playing with horror movie conventions, especially those of (duh) zombie movies, and it does so in such a fast-paced manner, and with special effects that are so much more impressive than you'd expect to see in such a low-budgeted movie, that it's almost impossible not to enjoy it. Titles aside, there are a few thematic parallels to be found with Dawn of the Dead (largely the frequent shifts in tone), but this is not, I repeat, NOT a tribute, a parody, or anything else of that nature.  Shaun of the Dead is its own creation, one that takes Romero's Dead trilogy as its starting point but comes up with more than enough inspired ideas of its own.  It's billed as ""A smash hit romantic comedy...with zombies,"" and while that description isn't too far off, the movie actually encompasses a significantly broader range of styles.It's rare for movies to work on this many levels, but Shaun of the Dead is such a great movie largely because it's so wide-ranging in tone: at its best, it perfectly encapsulates the combination of high comedy, horror, and drama that is everyday life, zombies or no zombies.  Indeed, the shambolic walking undead are just the latest in a series of troubles facing the movie's title character.  In fact, they come along at a somewhat opportune time in light of the catharses that Shaun faces in the early going, as the movie's first half-hour sees its 29-year-old protagonist facing something of an early mid-life crisis.  After all, when your girlfriend has just dumped you, you're stuck in a dead-end job at an electronics store, and your roommates are at each other's throats, there's nothing like an army of faceless zombies trying to (literally) tear you a new one to give you some perspective.  In this movie, the undead may intrude upon the world of the living, but that doesn't mean the trials of everyday life get put on hold.  If anything, they're magnified.  In that sense, aside from supplying the movie with some grisly frights and plenty of nasty gore, then, the zombies serve as a mighty fine plot device, enabling Shaun to find the assertiveness and determination he needs to get his life together while simultaneously handling the more mundane task of staying alive.  Much of the appeal of Shaun of the Dead actually comes from watching Shaun evolve from a confused, directionless underachiever into the decisive man of action that he is by film's end.And of course, it doesnt hurt that the movie's incredibly watchable from beginning to end, and undeniably hilarious for much of that time as well.  Edgar Wright, who co-wrote the script with Pegg, directs the movie with a manic, stylish, and ruthless efficiency that keeps things moving briskly from one wildly entertaining set piece to another.  Slapstick humor effortlessly shares space with plenty of dry British wit, with several truly unforgettable scenes along the way: you've got Shaun and his best friend Ed fending off the advances of a zombie while thinking she's just drunk; Shaun and company trying to impersonate zombies long enough to make it through a crowd of them to safety; and a rollicking three-person zombie beatdown with pool cues set to the tune of Queen.  In the next breath, though, the movie can have you sweating, as there's plenty here for fans of blood and guts.  Heads explode, zombies get impaled, throats get bitten, and one poor guy gets torn to pieces while still very much alive.As though the movie isn't enough, the DVD release contains tons of time-wasting extras to enhance the viewing experience.  As a whole the supplemental material provides all kinds of insight into the experience of making the movie, from Simon Pegg's video diary; to the flipboard Pegg and Wright used to sum up the plot; to special effects comparisons; to extended scenes laden with commentary.  Since the movie was made with a pretty small budget, it's interesting to see how the filmmakers had to work around monetary limitations while at the same time making a movie that steps outside of genre limitations.  Needless to say, you should pick up the widescreen edition if at all possible, as the picture quality on it is decidedly sweet, but whatever the case Shaun of the Dead is a movie that should not be missed.",5,Flesh-eaters are funny,1112832000,"04 7, 2005",2005,4627,"[""'re"", 'tired', 'lowest-common-denominator', 'genre', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'pumping', 'out', 'record', 'pace', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Originally', 'released', 'other', 'side', 'pond', 'English', 'horror-comedy', 'seamlessly', 'intense', 'zombie', 'terror', 'wry', 'humor', 'ever', 'coming', 'off', 'as', 'forced', 'condescending', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'clearly', 'lot', 'fun', 'playing', 'horror', 'movie', 'conventions', 'especially', 'duh', 'zombie', 'movies', 'so', 'such', 'fast-paced', 'manner', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', ""'d"", 'expect', 'see', 'such', 'low-budgeted', 'movie', 'almost', 'impossible', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Titles', 'aside', 'are', 'few', 'thematic', 'parallels', 'be', 'found', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'largely', 'frequent', 'shifts', 'tone', 'not', 'repeat', 'NOT', 'tribute', 'parody', 'anything', 'else', 'nature', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'own', 'creation', 'one', 'Romero', 'Dead', 'trilogy', 'starting', 'point', 'up', 'more', 'enough', 'inspired', 'ideas', 'own', 'billed', 'A', 'smash', 'hit', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'zombies', 'description', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'off', 'movie', 'actually', 'significantly', 'broader', 'range', 'styles.It', 'rare', 'movies', 'work', 'many', 'levels', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'such', 'great', 'movie', 'largely', 'so', 'wide-ranging', 'tone', 'best', 'perfectly', 'combination', 'high', 'comedy', 'horror', 'drama', 'everyday', 'life', 'zombies', 'zombies', 'Indeed', 'shambolic', 'walking', 'undead', 'are', 'just', 'latest', 'series', 'troubles', 'facing', 'movie', 'title', 'character', 'fact', 'come', 'along', 'somewhat', 'opportune', 'time', 'light', 'catharses', 'Shaun', 'early', 'going', 'movie', 'first', 'half-hour', '29-year-old', 'protagonist', 'facing', 'something', 'early', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'dumped', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'dead-end', 'job', 'electronics', 'store', 'roommates', 'are', 'other', 'throats', 'nothing', 'army', 'faceless', 'zombies', 'trying', 'literally', 'new', 'one', 'give', 'perspective', 'movie', 'undead', 'may', 'intrude', 'world', 'living', ""n't"", 'mean', 'trials', 'everyday', 'life', 'get', 'put', 'hold', 'anything', ""'re"", 'magnified', 'sense', 'aside', 'supplying', 'movie', 'grisly', 'frights', 'plenty', 'nasty', 'gore', 'then', 'zombies', 'serve', 'mighty', 'fine', 'plot', 'device', 'enabling', 'Shaun', 'find', 'assertiveness', 'determination', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'simultaneously', 'handling', 'more', 'mundane', 'task', 'staying', 'alive', 'Much', 'appeal', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'actually', 'watching', 'Shaun', 'evolve', 'confused', 'directionless', 'underachiever', 'decisive', 'man', 'action', 'film', 'end.And', 'course', 'hurt', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'watchable', 'beginning', 'end', 'undeniably', 'hilarious', 'much', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Pegg', 'movie', 'manic', 'stylish', 'ruthless', 'efficiency', 'things', 'moving', 'briskly', 'one', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'set', 'piece', 'Slapstick', 'humor', 'effortlessly', 'shares', 'space', 'plenty', 'dry', 'British', 'wit', 'several', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'scenes', 'way', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Shaun', 'best', 'friend', 'Ed', 'fending', 'off', 'advances', 'zombie', 'thinking', 'just', 'drunk', 'Shaun', 'company', 'trying', 'impersonate', 'zombies', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'crowd', 'safety', 'rollicking', 'three-person', 'zombie', 'pool', 'cues', 'set', 'tune', 'Queen', 'next', 'breath', 'though', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'sweating', 'plenty', 'here', 'fans', 'blood', 'guts', 'Heads', 'explode', 'zombies', 'get', 'impaled', 'throats', 'get', 'bitten', 'one', 'poor', 'guy', 'torn', 'pieces', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'movie', ""n't"", 'enough', 'DVD', 'release', 'tons', 'time-wasting', 'extras', 'enhance', 'viewing', 'experience', 'whole', 'supplemental', 'material', 'kinds', 'insight', 'experience', 'making', 'movie', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'video', 'diary', 'flipboard', 'Pegg', 'Wright', 'used', 'sum', 'up', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'comparisons', 'extended', 'scenes', 'laden', 'commentary', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'pretty', 'small', 'budget', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'work', 'around', 'monetary', 'limitations', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'movie', 'steps', 'genre', 'limitations', 'Needless', 'say', 'should', 'pick', 'up', 'widescreen', 'edition', 'possible', 'picture', 'quality', 'decidedly', 'sweet', 'case', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Shaun of the Dead

841301,AH82LVIW332S6,B0002MJT0I,Zombiefan1212,"[1, 9]","(More towards 4 1/2 stars)It's funny. One of the best comedies i've ever seen.This movie finally shows everyone what I have always believed. You can live your life in a world of walking zombies. They cannot get you. Also, it shows another thing that I believe. The world can handle slow zombies. They can get it under control. Fast zombies, probably not. Slow zombies, yes.The movie begins by showing us the disaster that is Shaun's love-life. After forgetting to make a reservation, his girlfriend brakes up with him. This is where we get into this funny scene where Shaun walking through the town and doesn't realize everyone has become a zombie. Walks through the town, goes to the store, gets a beer, goes home, doesn't notice a thing.Lots of good comedy in this movie. That, of course, is until they get into the pub. This is where they go from being new, a zombie movie the world has never seen before, into a regular zombie movie. It became humans vs the zombies. The zombies are outside, we're in here, they're breaking in, let's get out. It was all good until they got into the pub. It dropped the comedy thing for a while.The comedy comes back. So this is on the top three on my favorite zombie movies list.This movie had a lot more blood and gore than I ever expected it to. Some parts where a few people were a little disgusted, like the falling on the pole, but there is only one thing I can say about the part where they rip the guy open(the guy that, i think, looks like that Harry Potter kid). 26 years later, it still looks cheesy.1.)""Dawn of the Dead 2004""(17 movies later, this is still the best)2.)""Resident Evil: Apocalypse""(great)3.)""Shaun of the Dead""(a lot better than I could have expected)(I don't like comedies very much)I just want to add something in here. To all the Brits that say Americans make crappy comedies because they are nothing but fart jokes and Brits make great comedies because they don't do fart jokes. This movie had fart jokes. So shut up. American comedies are good to, just not the ones done by idiots like ""Scary Movie"". Also, the Brits also have their own joke they always do that I find pretty stupid. It's when they do that stupid thing where they change to another scene and the guy in that scene finishes the sentance for the guy in the other scene. I just don't find it funny.Someone asked if George Romero was going to work with the guys who made this movie to make the best zombie movie of all time. If George Romero is going to be part of it, then it is going to be a terrible movie. Everything he's done is crap. The only one that I found entertaining(3 stars entertaining) was ""Creepshow"". Romero's fourth movie is going to suck.Question-Where the hell are all those people that say everything is a rip-off of that crappy movie ""28 Days Later""? I mean, they were there when ""Dawn of the Dead 2004"" came out. They said it was nothing but rip-off of ""28 Days Later"" even though it wasn't. Then they said ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" was a rip-off of ""28 Days Later"". Wasn't anybody listening when we said ""28 Crappy Days Later"" was a rip-off of ""Resident Evil""? The whole blocking off the city thing in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" came from ""Resident Evil 2"" which came out in the 90's. Where are the people to say this is a rip-off of ""28 Days Later""? Where the hell are you people?One more thing.
