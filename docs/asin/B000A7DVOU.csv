He is a very versatile actor performing nicely either in dramas or comedies. And this little jewel of film is another excellent work of this sometimes and unfairly underrated actor. Here he plays Raymond who is unemployed at the time his half-brother tells him he is the heir of a property in a rural place in England. Very surprised, after saying good-bye to a lovely girl, his best friend in life, and receiving a half-angel kind of brooch as a memento, he flies to his new destination. Arriving there, he meets Mr. Slee, in principle the epitome of the very bad guy who wishes to buy Raymond's property which is...an ancient church where he thinks there is a hidden treasure. Raymond, little by little gets to know the other inhabitants of the village such as Diggity, an orfan boy, and Rachel, a beautiful woman who owns the local Bed & Breakfast and also a gypsy family. His adventures start by the time he gives up selling his property... Watch the film and you will find out why there are angels protecting and changing many people's lives, particularly Raymond's!",5,An angel on earth,1221436800,"09 15, 2008",2008,1167,"['watched', 'Mannequin', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'became', 'fan', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'works', 'very', 'versatile', 'actor', 'performing', 'nicely', 'dramas', 'comedies', 'little', 'jewel', 'film', 'excellent', 'work', 'sometimes', 'unfairly', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Here', 'Raymond', 'who', 'unemployed', 'time', 'half-brother', 'tells', 'heir', 'property', 'rural', 'place', 'England', 'Very', 'surprised', 'saying', 'good-bye', 'lovely', 'girl', 'best', 'friend', 'life', 'receiving', 'half-angel', 'kind', 'brooch', 'memento', 'new', 'destination', 'Arriving', 'there', 'Mr.', 'Slee', 'principle', 'epitome', 'very', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'buy', 'Raymond', 'property', 'ancient', 'church', 'where', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'Raymond', 'little', 'little', 'know', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'village', 'such', 'Diggity', 'orfan', 'boy', 'Rachel', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'local', 'Bed', 'Breakfast', 'also', 'gypsy', 'family', 'adventures', 'start', 'time', 'up', 'selling', 'property', 'Watch', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'are', 'angels', 'protecting', 'changing', 'many', 'people', 'lives', 'particularly', 'Raymond']",Heaven Must Wait

Virtually ignored, this film has the elements that Hollywood screenwriters have missed out on for several years: character, unique plot and it is genuinely moving.Andrew McCarthy stars as a Georgia slouch who inherits property in England. Since he is of no use at home, his stepbrother insists he go there. Much to Kane's (McCarthy) dismay, he inherits a rundown church in a rural British outpost. Along the way we meet a greedy, rich man who wants the church to dig for a fabled treasure, a bitter divorcee (Louise Lombard) who runs the local B&B;, a gypsy family and a charming orphan who wants to become an angel. He thinks converting Kane into a man Lombard will fall in love with (they both have many misunderstandings in the film), he will become one.This is a lovely quiet movie. It is a character study that is so interesting it runs lightening fast and is over, leaving you wanting more.Forget the comic book, computer game, old TV series remakes (which is all Hollywood is cranking out) and watch this movie.It's genuine.

Upon arrival in the seemingly idyllic village of Copeingwell, Raymond is disappointed to find that his inheritance consists of a crumbling church. The village villain, bully and Scrooge, a Mr Slee makes Raymond an offer on the land and church, having his own dark motives, having to do with treasure that supposedly lies buried in the derelict church. Raymond also has to deal with a grumpy but attractive divorcee [Louise Lombard] who runs the local B&B; and a young orphan boy named Diggity who believes that if he can get Raymond's life turned around for the better and improve Raymond then he [Diggity] will get to be an angel.The story as described here may seem uninspired but the actors are wonderful in their roles and the lush English countryside provides a beautiful setting for this charming story about finding one's self, purpose and happiness, and a sense of community.
