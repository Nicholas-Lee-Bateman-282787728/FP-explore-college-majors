975522,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000EOTTV8,A Customer,"[6, 6]","It's always refreshing around awards season to witness a performance by an actress that you know is going to make a big impression. In Transamerica, Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman just astounds, in a feat of acting that is nothing short of extraordinary. This is a poignant and often deliriously funny road-trip film and Huffman sinks her teeth into playing a sensitive, yet conflicted preoperative transsexual with such a refreshing candor that most viewers will be just blown away by the film.The film marks an auspicious debut for writer-director Duncan Tucker, who spins a marvelous tale of a reluctant but curious dad who learns he has a son. The dad, however is soon to become a woman, and is now decked out in tasteful and chic pastels, but the film cleverly avoids the clich&eacute;'s, thanks to Tucker's sensitive hand and the subtle work of Huffman and the rest of the pitch-perfect cast, especially Kevin Zegers as the lost-and-found offspring.Huffman plays Bree/Stanley a self-contained preoperative transsexual who lives in her little Los Angeles bungalow, and works as a waitress in a local colourful Mexican restaurant. We first meet her a week before she is to have her gender reassignment surgery and her closest friend is her compassionate and kindly therapist, Margaret (Elizabeth Pena).But just before the ultimate surgical step is due to take place, she receives a phone call from a 17-year-old New York inmate, who claims to be Stanley's son. Of course, Bree has come too far to let anything derail her surgery - she is so single-minded that she dismisses the unwanted disruption. However, when Margaret learns of the phone call and her patient's offspring, she refuses to OK the medical procedure until Bree goes to New York to address the matter.Bree flies East to help the boy, who has run away from home after his mother's suicide. Allowing him to think that she is a Christian missionary - her upright, churchly bearing makes it easy to believe - she decides to take him back to rural Kentucky, where his stepfather lives. She buys a chartreuse station wagon to drive Toby cross-country, but Toby, rather than returning to Kentucky, wants to go to Los Angles where he expects to find his father living large and hopes to break into movies -- of the San Fernando Valley sort.The film is full of unexpected twists and turns, as Bree and Toby traverse the country eating in homey little roadside cafes, staying in comfy hotels, and even camping out. Soon they're developing an uncommon and strangely likable bond. This is the land where banjos and acoustic guitars compete with the crickets and loons, and along the way they meet a variety of characters from a free-spirited vegan hitcher (Grant Monohon) to a gentlemanly New Mexico rancher (Graham Greene) who gallantly comes to Bree's assistance, more than a bit smitten.It is only after an incident on the road that the couple is forced to confront Bree's parents in their kitsch Phoenix mansion. Her father, Murray (Burt Young), is an easygoing fellow in loose-fitting linen, but it is her mother, Elizabeth (the astonishing Fionnula Flanagan), who commands our attention. With her peroxide curls, silk pantsuits and heavy makeup, she might be an aging movie diva, and she has the volatile temperament to prove it. She's absolutely repulsed by her son's new look, but underneath the cold exterior, she's desperately trying to understand him.The performances are all astounding, but this is Huffman's movie, and she totally steals the show, brilliantly embodying the complex layers of self-awareness and denial. She's prim and proper, but also raw and gutsy, and although she may not yet have totally got womanhood right, she's a lovely, sensitive kind hearted person, who we all know will end up being an absolutely gorgeous woman. It is not just that the actress plays a man who plays a woman, but also that she must impersonate a performer in the midst of learning a complicated role. Her performance is a complex metamorphosis - it is thrilling to watch and was the real Best Actress performance of 2005.As she each day she paints on a face and puts on a voice to become more truly herself, her uneasy self-consciousness is a constant, especially when a child's innocent but discerning question plunges Bree into despair. As a boy who is tempted by cheap drugs and uses the art of seduction to get his way, Zegers conveys Toby's essential sweetness and hunger for real affection, making him much more than just a vain or damaged kid.But what makes Transamerica one of the year's best films is the sensitive and intuitive way that Tucker presents the world of transexualism. He never judges Bree, or preaches, and throughout the story there is much to be learned about the history and place transsexuals once had in society. The astute and intelligent script weaves laugh-out-loud humor into his characters' longing for acceptance, but most importantly, the director treats Bree as a fully rounded person, with all her quirks, insecurities and foibles, rather than some kind of objective, and scientific case study.

975524,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000EOTTV8,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 2]","Transamerica is a wonderful small movie resting squarely on the capable shoulders of Felicity Huffman who gives a jaw-dropping, Oscar-worthy performance.  The film succeeds primarily because it refuses to play along with stereotypes.  There is no heavy-handed moralizing, no bitterness, and thank heavens, no over-the-top caricatures (think feather boas and sequined gowns).  On the contrary, Stanley/Bree is simply a woman born in man's body who is going through the difficult, and emotionally demanding, transition; in some respects primarily a matter of re-engineering.  That she must confront the product of her past, son Toby, played convincingly by a surly Kevin Zegers who is at once streetwise, innocent, hard-hearted, and vulnerable, is merely the film's ""gadget,"" the premise that gets it off the ground.What comes next is essentially a ""buddy picture,"" the unlikely duo head west for sunny California.  Along the way they confront some hard truths about themselves and their respective families, grow closer, and develop a very new twist on the old ""healing the relationship with the long lost father"" routine.  The Dodge City showdown arrives in Phoenix where Bree reunites with her estranged parents.  Her mother, played by Fionnula Flanagan, nearly walks off with the movie, (which is saying something), her performance is astounding.  But every minute of this charming and thoroughly likable film belongs to Felicity Huffman whose creation of Bree, a showcase of the actor's art and craft, is both complete and completely winning.  Bree is certainly not splashy, on the contrary, she is the dowdy, turn-of-the-century spinster third-grade math teacher you never had.  She is conservative, staid, reserved, and prim, her mannerisms cautious.  This is less because she is learning how to ""act like a woman"" than because it is her actual nature.Most remarkable is how she speaks - her vocabulary, elocution, and tone.  (Re-watch Transamerica and imagine how Ms. Huffman must have labored to get her voice to perform this feat.)  Listening to Bree speak is an unmitigated pleasure, her words are perfectly formed and her phrasing is invariably smart, frequently laced with sarcasm and humor so subtle one might easily miss it.  This is the triumph of Ms. Huffman's work, that in Bree she has created not a freak or a symbol but a person.  One wonders, sometimes, about the courage of really good actors.  Ms. Huffman certainly must be comfortable in her own femininity to take on this role.Transamerica begins focusing on the mechanics of artifice, the ""props"" required to create illusion.  Even with their help, most viewers will be struck by how physically unattractive Stanley/Bree is.  It doesn't take long before we find Bree very attractive, it is a beauty born of inner strength.  This is a movie about fighting for honesty and maintaining dignity in the process.  By the end of it you will most likely hope that Bree is able to return to Calvin Two Goats, Graham Greene, and find that most precious quantity - not just love, acceptance for what we actually are.

Her dream of some day getting the ultimate operation come closer as the movie develops, however, her dream crashes to pieces when she finds out that when she was ""Stanley"" he had a boy named Toby(Kevin Zegers). The movie shows the long journey of these two individuals that after meeting each other decide to go all the way to Los Angeles, so that Toby can fulfill his dream of being an actor and Bree can finally get her operation. Throughout most of the movie, Toby does not know that Bree is his real father so the connection between these two is mostly ""friendly"". Half way to Los Angeles Bree makes an attempt to take Toby back home, where he belongs, but after finding out that his step-father used to rape him, she decides to take him with her all the way to L.A. During their trip, Toby finds out the true Bree(that she used to be a man), and feels cheated because she lied to him. After embarrassing her a few times, Bree can not take it anymore and decides to get away from him, but the love that she has developed for him takes over and she decides to stay. They both develop a very strong bond towards each other, and more than a friendship comes in the way (as you will see in the movie). I won't ruin the rest of it, but this will give you more than enough reasons to get the movie, and check it out.I was very impressed with Felicity Huffman acting. She is great in every sense, and deserves every single award and nomination that she has gotten for this picture; and I have to say that she was my favorite for wining the ""Best Actress"" in the Academy Awards.

975527,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000EOTTV8,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I wasn't sure what to think about Transamerica, but it's actually a decent... drama/comedy I guess?  Whatever.Honestly, what may seem like a comedy in the beginning when you see a man gradually change into a woman is rather hilarious, but... I'm not really sure it was intended to be humorous.A part of me thinks the movie writers really wanted to create something that people who have gone through a sex change would be able to relate to, and for those of us completely confused why someone would even *want* to change their gender... it does allow me to see how it's probably not a big deal at all.  That is, if most transexuals really *are* like the main character in Transamerica.  This film shows that transexuals are completely normal on the inside and even understanding and compassionate for other peoples feelings.  It actually does a really great job in that regard.Anyway the storyline is about a man who becomes a woman, bails his son out of jail, and they head across the country on an adventure.  It's not really an adventurous type film though- it's more like -through lots of drama and a slight dash of comedy- we find out more and more about the son, and how he accepts what he initially believes is a freak of a father.What's MOST shocking about Transamerica is that it's the son who's actually got the bigger problems- you just don't realize this in the very beginning.  I don't want to spoil what those problems are- you must find out for yourself!  Let's just say, he's an interesting character too.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 7]","With all the hype surrounding BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN this year (2005), it was surprising  that TRANSAMERICA clearly got overlooked in many film award categories. Although Felicity Huffman received a Best Actress win from the Golden Globes (and an Oscar nomination), this movie really deserves MUCH more praise. Not only was the basic film better than BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (my opinion), it had stronger supporting roles.I also need to pontificate about the unfairness of independent films and how Hollyweird views them when Oscar time rolls around. If you doubt this, all we need to do is look at THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S reviews of Brokeback (large approval rating) and TRANSAMERICA (a negative ranking). I think this type of inconsistent approval/disapproval of similar films is also because the ""big"" movies get more press because they have the money to shove around for promotional purposes, while the little indie's have to struggle on minuscule budgets.If you're man (or woman) enough to sit and open your mind to people's problems, you're sure to enjoy TRANSAMERICA. Dealing with the life of one man's desire to become a woman, this film shows us the internal and external battles one might face. And when Bree (aka Stanley) decides to undergo a final surgical alteration to make her ""all woman"" she has to get approval by a medical doctor as well as a psychologist. The movie begins with Bree getting that approval, only to have it yanked away by the discovery of a child of which she/he is the father. Toby (an amazing Kevin Zegers), calls his father - Bree - one day with a request to bail him out of jail. Bree has to travel from L.A. to New York to accomplish this (at the behest of his/her psychologist). Bree then has to bring her 17-year-old boy across the U.S., but doesn't tell him he/she is his father. The tension in the film is continually ratcheted up as Bree struggles to make sense of her own life while trying to keep her/his son from self-imploding. Bree also has to deal with her/his family during their travels across country, and it's both funny and sad to watch the dysfunctional antics of children and adults alike.As I stated earlier, too, the supporting cast is excellent. Not only was Felicity Huffman (DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES TV series) completely believable as a female actor acting like a man who wants to become a woman, but Kevin Zegers pulls in an awesome performance as her confused son. Fionnula Flanagan (WAKING NED DEVINE, 1998) performs the part of an overbearing mother as if born to the part. Burt Young (ROCKY series) sheds his hard-nosed ""Paulie"" persona in the Rocky films and becomes the reluctant supporter of his son's choice to change into a woman. Even Graham Greene gives us a tough but ultimately ignorant man who helps drive Bree and his/her son across several states.TRANSAMERICA goes beyond VICTOR/VICTORIA and BOYS DON'T CRY, and gives us the true meaning of what it is to be a person. It's not about the sex. It's all about the other things, family, self-worth, and all those insignificant items that add up quickly to form one giant melting pot we all find ourselves in.What a shame more Oscar nominations weren't given to this terrific character film.",5,Huffman Deserves Every Award She Gets!,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,3201,"['hype', 'surrounding', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'year', '2005', 'was', 'surprising', 'TRANSAMERICA', 'clearly', 'got', 'overlooked', 'many', 'film', 'award', 'categories', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'received', 'Best', 'Actress', 'win', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'movie', 'really', 'MUCH', 'more', 'praise', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'basic', 'film', 'better', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'opinion', 'had', 'stronger', 'supporting', 'roles.I', 'also', 'need', 'pontificate', 'unfairness', 'independent', 'films', 'how', 'Hollyweird', 'when', 'Oscar', 'time', 'rolls', 'around', 'doubt', 'need', 'do', 'look', 'THE', 'CHICAGO', 'TRIBUNE', 'reviews', 'Brokeback', 'large', 'approval', 'rating', 'TRANSAMERICA', 'negative', 'ranking', 'think', 'type', 'inconsistent', 'approval/disapproval', 'similar', 'films', 'also', 'big', 'movies', 'get', 'more', 'press', 'have', 'money', 'shove', 'around', 'promotional', 'purposes', 'little', 'indie', 'have', 'struggle', 'minuscule', 'budgets.If', ""'re"", 'man', 'woman', 'enough', 'sit', 'open', 'mind', 'people', 'problems', ""'re"", 'sure', 'enjoy', 'TRANSAMERICA', 'Dealing', 'life', 'one', 'man', 'desire', 'become', 'woman', 'film', 'internal', 'external', 'battles', 'one', 'might', 'face', 'when', 'Bree', 'aka', 'Stanley', 'undergo', 'final', 'surgical', 'alteration', 'make', 'woman', 'get', 'approval', 'medical', 'doctor', 'as', 'well', 'psychologist', 'movie', 'Bree', 'getting', 'approval', 'only', 'have', 'yanked', 'away', 'discovery', 'child', 'she/he', 'father', 'Toby', 'amazing', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'father', 'Bree', 'one', 'day', 'request', 'bail', 'jail', 'Bree', 'travel', 'L.A.', 'New', 'York', 'accomplish', 'behest', 'his/her', 'psychologist', 'Bree', 'then', 'bring', '17-year-old', 'boy', 'U.S.', ""n't"", 'tell', 'father', 'tension', 'film', 'continually', 'ratcheted', 'up', 'Bree', 'make', 'sense', 'own', 'life', 'trying', 'keep', 'her/his', 'son', 'self-imploding', 'Bree', 'also', 'deal', 'her/his', 'family', 'travels', 'country', 'funny', 'sad', 'watch', 'dysfunctional', 'antics', 'children', 'adults', 'alike.As', 'stated', 'earlier', 'too', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'DESPERATE', 'HOUSEWIVES', 'TV', 'series', 'completely', 'believable', 'female', 'actor', 'acting', 'man', 'who', 'become', 'woman', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'awesome', 'performance', 'confused', 'son', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'WAKING', 'NED', 'DEVINE', '1998', 'part', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'born', 'part', 'Burt', 'Young', 'ROCKY', 'series', 'hard-nosed', 'Paulie', 'persona', 'Rocky', 'films', 'reluctant', 'supporter', 'son', 'choice', 'change', 'woman', 'Even', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'tough', 'ultimately', 'ignorant', 'man', 'who', 'drive', 'Bree', 'son', 'several', 'states.TRANSAMERICA', 'VICTOR/VICTORIA', 'BOYS', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'CRY', 'true', 'meaning', 'what', 'be', 'person', 'not', 'sex', 'other', 'things', 'family', 'self-worth', 'insignificant', 'items', 'add', 'up', 'quickly', 'form', 'one', 'giant', 'melting', 'pot', 'find', 'shame', 'more', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'terrific', 'character', 'film']",N/A

Those honors (Best Actress wins in Golden Globe and Independent Spirit Award, nominee for SAG and Academy Award) are well deserved, in an very difficult role as a male-to-female transexual, dealing with pre-op jitters, complicated by the sudden appearance of a teenage son (Kevin Zegers) she fathered and never knew about.While Bree (Felicity's character) is clear about her transgender nature, and knows she is doing the right thing by going through with the operation, the emotional baggage from her childhood and earlier life make her passive and weak-spirited.  She almost has to be bullied into flying from Los Angeles to New York City to meet her 16 year old son, in trouble with the police there after having run away from an abusive stepfather following his mother's death.  Although very different from Toby, they are, in some ways, kindred spirits, in that both have low self-esteem and a degree of self-loathing.  She chickens out from telling Toby she is his father, instead claiming to be a church missionary.  He insists he wants to go to California, and they set out driving together cross country, learning about each other as well as themselves.Huffman's acting (and makeup) is incredible, with her voice even descending further in one part of the film (when she is without her pre-op hormones).  The handsome and talented Zegers is also perfect for his role, as a streetwise but somewhat insecure young man looking for love and acceptance.  Beautifully photographed (in NY, AZ and CA), the screenplay is witty, realistic and positive. I was expecting the transexual aspect of the film to be front-and-center in the story, and was pleasantly surprised that it was almost incidental to the real focus of the story: learning to love and accept yourself as the first step in being able to relate to and love anyone else.  The fact that the message could have just as easily been delivered by a gay or lesbian (or straight) character reinforces the concept that, as different as we may be on the surface, we are all really very similar where it counts.  I give it five full stars out of five; this one is a permanent addition to my DVD collection.Rated R for incidental nudity (Zegers) and adult content.

975534,A2LN2AK7HNBI8N,B000EOTTV8,Bruce Varner,"[3, 3]","The central challenge to all actors is to create characters that the audience can relate to, and that are believable.  There is a spectrum of difficulty, depending on the character.  Jerry Seinfeld playing Jerry Seinfeld in ""Seinfeld"" is on the simple end of the spectrum.  No disrespect is intended here, as ""Seinfeld"" is probably my favorite TV show of all time.The characters played by Felicity Huffman and Kevin Zegers lie on the difficult end of the spectrum.  These parts should come with warnings for actors.  Let's start with the character of Bree (Huffman).  She is asked to play a man, who is in the midst of a transgender procedure.  So, fundamentally, she plays a man playing a woman, who becomes a woman.  In addition to her own issues, she finds some serious baggage in the form of a 17 year old son she never knew about.  This son is in trouble with the law when they meet.  She will go on a journey to California with this boy.  Along the way, she will have her possessions stolen, deal with a high-maintenance child, face humiliation at the hands of her parents, and all the time carry the secret that she is the boy's father.Then there is the Toby character (Zegers).  Toby is on the wrong side of the law, is a prostitute, is bisexual at best, and abuses drugs.  His mother committed suicide (he found her body), and his stepfather molested him.  He goes on this cross-country journey with a woman he believes to be a missionary, then learns that she is a he, then learns that she/he is his dad.Whew!  These parts demand virtuoso acting, and this certain to polarize script demands sensitive directing.  Huffman and Zegers were absolutely incredible.  We saw Bree's struggle with her her demons, and her struggle to adjust to parenting.  In one scene, Toby has run from her, and her grief is palpable.  It is a poignant and difficult scene.  Huffman plays this character as always on the brink of boiling over, struggling to maintain control and her own sanity, and never quite comfortable.  Toby has some great moments.  The scene where we learn that his stepfather molested him is incredibly tense and likely to arouse anger when you watch it.  His shock and anger when Bree's secrets are revealed is very real.  My favorite part of his performance is how he showed shame.  In one scene, he turns a homosexual trick with a stranger at a truck stop.  He and Bree needed money, and tricks and dope peddling are the only ways he knows how to make money.  Far from being cynical and all business, he was ashamed.  At the end of the movie, we see his shame in his ""acting"" career.  What made Zegers' performance brilliant is how incredibly understated it all was.  No tearing at clothing and screaming to the heavens.  Zegers communicated his shame and self-loathing with just a look.  Wow.One reviewer remarked that Huffman should have won an Oscar for this performance.  The Oscar that year went to Reese Witherspoon for her portrayal of June Carter in ""Walk The Line"".  Reese's performance was extraordinary, but Felicity started with a higher degree of difficulty.  Oscars aside, she and husband William H. Macy (Executive Producer) should rightly be proud of this film.Highly recommended.

The acting is superb and Felicity Huffman could not have done better. Hopefully the super job she did playing the transgender Bree will provide her with more opportunities to reveal her considerable talents. Kevin Zegers deserves praise for the excellent performance as Toby, Bree's son. It is highly recommended entertainment.Underneath the compelling storyline, there is an exploration of the concept of identity that is a great strength of the film. Bree was once a man named Stanley, reared in an upper middle-class home in Phoenix with a controlling Irish-Catholic mother and quite but supportive Jewish father. After ten years of college without ever getting a degree, Stanley flounders around in phone marketing and as Bree works in a Mexican restaurant as a waitress as part of the gender re-assignment process. But Bree is going into surgery thinking that this is the answer to her transgender sexual identity but also without regard to reconciling the past so that she moves toward the future with no burdens from her past clinging to her psychological well-being. This is the gift of the phone call from her son, locked up in NYC for street hustling. It is the reconciliation adventures with her son that eventually leads to the reconciliation with her parents and with herself.The character of Toby is equally complex in that he is a child that has been abandoned by his natural mother through her suicide and that has been sexually molested by his step-father until he runs away from home to escape the sexual abuse. A very painful and touching scene in the film is when Toby, finally grateful for the physical protection and parental disciplinary limits that Bree offers, offers the one thing he feels he has to offer, which is his body, to Bree. She realizes that his perception of her must be based on more honest information and she reveals that she is Toby's father.Bree has thought that the day after her sexual reassignment surgery would be the best day of her life, and yet when that day comes she cries with her therapist. She cries because whereas her body has now changed, she is unfulfilled as a parent, a role that she began to adopt in her journey across the USA with Toby. The film is reconciled around this issue rather than around the issue of sexual-reassignment. Toby needs a parent and he senses this and Bree has awakened not only to her new sexual identity role but also to her role as a parent, one that will greatly enhance her growth and fulfillment in life.It is the basic human fulfillment needs of all human beings that is the under grid of this excellent film, which has been made very entertaining by the less than typical story line and characters, the excellent script, and the outstanding performance of the actors.",5,There is much to offer in this film about a parent who happens to be transgendered,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,2881,"['film', 'will', 'surprise', 'honest', 'direct', 'engaging', 'heart-felt', 'story', 'script', 'clever', 'well', 'written', 'acting', 'superb', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'Hopefully', 'super', 'job', 'did', 'playing', 'transgender', 'Bree', 'will', 'provide', 'more', 'opportunities', 'reveal', 'considerable', 'talents', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'praise', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Toby', 'Bree', 'son', 'highly', 'recommended', 'entertainment.Underneath', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'concept', 'identity', 'great', 'strength', 'film', 'Bree', 'was', 'once', 'man', 'named', 'Stanley', 'reared', 'upper', 'middle-class', 'home', 'Phoenix', 'controlling', 'Irish-Catholic', 'mother', 'quite', 'supportive', 'Jewish', 'father', 'ten', 'years', 'college', 'ever', 'getting', 'degree', 'Stanley', 'flounders', 'around', 'phone', 'marketing', 'Bree', 'Mexican', 'restaurant', 'waitress', 'part', 'gender', 're-assignment', 'process', 'Bree', 'going', 'surgery', 'thinking', 'answer', 'transgender', 'sexual', 'identity', 'also', 'regard', 'reconciling', 'past', 'future', 'burdens', 'past', 'clinging', 'psychological', 'well-being', 'gift', 'phone', 'call', 'son', 'locked', 'up', 'NYC', 'street', 'hustling', 'reconciliation', 'son', 'eventually', 'reconciliation', 'parents', 'herself.The', 'character', 'Toby', 'equally', 'complex', 'child', 'been', 'abandoned', 'natural', 'mother', 'suicide', 'been', 'sexually', 'molested', 'step-father', 'away', 'home', 'escape', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'very', 'painful', 'touching', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Toby', 'finally', 'grateful', 'physical', 'protection', 'parental', 'disciplinary', 'limits', 'Bree', 'one', 'thing', 'offer', 'body', 'Bree', 'perception', 'must', 'be', 'based', 'more', 'honest', 'information', 'Toby', 'father.Bree', 'thought', 'day', 'sexual', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'day', 'life', 'yet', 'when', 'day', 'therapist', 'body', 'now', 'changed', 'unfulfilled', 'parent', 'role', 'began', 'adopt', 'journey', 'USA', 'Toby', 'film', 'reconciled', 'issue', 'rather', 'issue', 'sexual-reassignment', 'Toby', 'parent', 'Bree', 'awakened', 'not', 'only', 'new', 'sexual', 'identity', 'role', 'also', 'role', 'parent', 'one', 'will', 'greatly', 'enhance', 'growth', 'fulfillment', 'life.It', 'basic', 'human', 'fulfillment', 'needs', 'human', 'beings', 'grid', 'excellent', 'film', 'been', 'made', 'very', 'entertaining', 'less', 'typical', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'excellent', 'script', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'actors']",N/A

Clay ""drakkar91""","[4, 5]","Kudos to the Weinstein Company and IFC films for delivering a no holds barred movie.Summary: The name sort of says it all - this is a film about a transgendered person, and their travels across America.  The performances by Felicity Huffman and Kevin Zegers are outstanding.  I do not watch ""Desperate Housewives"", and have never seen Kevin perform, so their is no bias here.  Felicity IS this film - she carries the story.  Bree (Huffman) is about to undergo transgender surgery and become a woman when she receives a call that her 17-year old son (whom she thought was long gone from her life), is in jail in New York City and needs help.  And so begins the journey.  Bree heads to New York where she and Toby (Zegers) meet.  They begin a trek across country so that Bree can be in Los Angeles in about a week for her surgery.  Toby makes a living on the street, hustling men and women, drugs, whatever it takes.  The combination is not a match made in heaven, but makes for an interesting storyline.What I Liked: The relationship that develops between Bree and Toby is real, it is believable.  It is also odd and complex.  The viewer learns quickly that Bree is Toby's father, but she keeps this a secret from Toby through most of the film.  She also keeps her transgender status a secret as well.  They meet a host of characters as they travel across America.  And with each visit, we learn the true meaning of ""dysfunction"".What I Did NOT Like: I started wathcing the movie a week ago, and took a call from a friend.  I was about 30 minutes into the film, and had yet to be caught.  So it took me a week to finish watching it.  From my perspective, it moved at 1 speed, which is ok, after all this is an art-house style film, not a big hollywood production (many of which are so overrated).  I watch a lot of off-beat films, and this one didn't grab me.  But is was a very good film overall.Final Word: The film is less about transgender people, and more about human conflict, understanding and compassion.  As Zeger (Toby) said in the DVD extra, his Grandfather pretty much forgot the film was about a transexual, though he added that he didn't approve of what Bree was doing.  Fair enough.  I have a very open mind, ""to each his (or her) own"".The DVD: Includes a conversation with Felicity and another with Kevin, as well as the theatrical trailer and a music video by Dolly Parton, which features scenes from the film.

That revelation comes as something of a shock to him and launches him on a turbulent road trip in search of his offspring.Bree Osbourne, the main character in ""Transamerica,"" would probably find Murray's dilemma pretty small potatoes.Played by Felicity Huffman, Bree's a Southern California waitress and telemarketer who learns that she, too, has a son she didn't know about.The short explanation behind that rather sizable lapse is that she's a pre-op transsexual -- formerly a glum-looking man named Stanley Schupach -- who's just one crucial procedure away from complete sexual reassignment.More than most women, Bree understandably objects to being casually called ""dude,"" and motherhood definitely doesn't fit into her plans. Her doctor (Elizabeth Pena), however, refuses to greenlight her final surgery unless Bree owns up to Stanley's offspring, so she heads to New York to meet her son Toby (Kevin Zegers). As fate would have it, he's a 17-year-old runaway who deals drugs, hustles, shoplifts and has an eye toward a career in pornography.Obviously, we're a long way from the cinematic realm of, say, ""Cheaper By the Dozen."" But the foregoing synopsis, while accurate, makes ""Transamerica"" sound a lot more sordid than it actually is. The movie's most interesting twist is that Bree, despite all the factors that make her different, is a lot more traditional and conservative than most of the characters she encounters. We see the story through her eyes and, as she and Toby travel back to Los Angeles, she encounters a lot of characters.Huffman has been nominated for an Oscar for her performance and deservedly so; she's the film's center. All through the movie, she manages to both hide behind herself (obscured behind heavy make-up, constantly apprehensive about her enunciation and intonation) and still remain sympathetic. Viewers who know Huffman only from ""Desperate Housewives"" may not recognize Lynette Scavo anywhere onscreen.The movie is also populated with other fine performances, particularly Zegers, who looks like a young Billy Crudup and has some of the same range; Graham Greene, as a kindly cattle farmer; and Burt Young, Carrie Preston and Fionnula Flanagan as Bree's father, sister and practically radioactive mother.The movie's main drawback, however, is its fairly languid pace and sense of familiarity. It never really breaks out of its groove or aspires to heights beyond those of a standard low-budget comedy. Despite this, or maybe because of it, viewers who aren't scared off by the subject may find ""Transamerica"" a brash-but-amusing little surprise.",3,A brash but amusing and occasionally moving surprise,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2732,"['Last', 'year', 'movie', 'Broken', 'Flowers', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'played', 'aging', 'Lothario', 'who', 'long', 'fact', 'had', 'fathered', 'child', 'revelation', 'something', 'shock', 'turbulent', 'road', 'trip', 'search', 'offspring.Bree', 'Osbourne', 'main', 'character', 'Transamerica', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'Murray', 'dilemma', 'pretty', 'small', 'potatoes.Played', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'Bree', 'Southern', 'California', 'waitress', 'telemarketer', 'who', 'too', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'about.The', 'short', 'explanation', 'rather', 'sizable', 'lapse', 'pre-op', 'transsexual', 'formerly', 'glum-looking', 'man', 'named', 'Stanley', 'Schupach', 'who', 'just', 'one', 'crucial', 'procedure', 'away', 'complete', 'sexual', 'reassignment.More', 'most', 'women', 'Bree', 'understandably', 'being', 'casually', 'called', 'dude', 'motherhood', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'fit', 'plans', 'doctor', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'however', 'greenlight', 'final', 'surgery', 'Bree', 'up', 'Stanley', 'offspring', 'New', 'York', 'meet', 'son', 'Toby', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'fate', 'would', 'have', '17-year-old', 'runaway', 'who', 'drugs', 'hustles', 'shoplifts', 'eye', 'career', 'pornography.Obviously', ""'re"", 'long', 'way', 'cinematic', 'realm', 'say', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'foregoing', 'synopsis', 'accurate', 'Transamerica', 'sound', 'lot', 'more', 'sordid', 'actually', 'movie', 'most', 'interesting', 'twist', 'Bree', 'factors', 'make', 'different', 'lot', 'more', 'traditional', 'conservative', 'most', 'characters', 'see', 'story', 'eyes', 'Toby', 'travel', 'back', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'lot', 'characters.Huffman', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'deservedly', 'so', 'film', 'center', 'movie', 'hide', 'obscured', 'heavy', 'make-up', 'constantly', 'apprehensive', 'enunciation', 'intonation', 'still', 'remain', 'sympathetic', 'Viewers', 'who', 'know', 'Huffman', 'only', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'may', 'not', 'recognize', 'Lynette', 'Scavo', 'anywhere', 'onscreen.The', 'movie', 'also', 'populated', 'other', 'fine', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Zegers', 'who', 'young', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'same', 'range', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'kindly', 'cattle', 'farmer', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Carrie', 'Preston', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Bree', 'father', 'sister', 'practically', 'radioactive', 'mother.The', 'movie', 'main', 'drawback', 'however', 'fairly', 'languid', 'pace', 'sense', 'familiarity', 'never', 'really', 'groove', 'aspires', 'heights', 'standard', 'low-budget', 'comedy', 'maybe', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'scared', 'off', 'subject', 'may', 'find', 'Transamerica', 'brash-but-amusing', 'little', 'surprise']",N/A

Forced by her sympathetic therapist (Elizabeth Pena) to confront and reconcile her past, Bree bails out the rambunctious, unsuspecting Toby, thereby embarking on a roller-coaster adventure that takes them both by surprise.  Together they set out on a cross-country trip from New York to Los Angeles, where they will part ways:  she will have her long-anticipated sex change surgery and he can pursue his dreams of tracking down his ""real"" father and go on to become a well-paid(porn) film star.The stiff, proper, overeducated Bree is nicely counterbalanced by the nonjudgmental affect of her street-wise urchin of a son, who is also keenly intelligent. Along the way, we meet good Samaritan cowboys (Graham Greene), lascivious truck drivers, thieving grifters and Bree's quirky, eccentric parents, who demonstrate plausible (though improbable) unconditional love toward Bree (the comic geniuses of Burt Young and the great Fionula Flannigan--as Bree's parents--are on terrific display here).  A sweet and good-natured comedy, ""Transamerica"" has many pleasures:  it is full of surprising twists and, most of all, astounding performances from Huffman and Zegers.  Huffman, who lowered her voice several octaves for the duration of filming, achieves the amazing trick of erasing every trace of her considerable beauty and natural femininity--her every gesture of a gender-compromised man imitating a woman feels authentic and true-to-life!  Completely transforming herself under a mountain of unflattering (but believable) makeup, Huffman communicates a profoundly touching core of feeling for the misfit transexual on a journey for love and self-acceptance.

I've been meaning to see this movie since it was first released but always managed to miss it.  Finally, I gave it a go and I'm pleased with the result.Huffman playes Bree (once Stanley) a pre-opt transexual who is eagerly looking forward to the upcoming operation that will finally give her the body she has always longed for.  With everything set, an unforeseen problem pops up-------a son she never knew she had.  Bree's therapist forces Bree to confront this problem before getting the life altering surgery she will receive in a week.Leaving her home in Los Angeles and arriving in New York, Bree makes bail for her seventeen year old son (arrested for prostitution and drugs) and agrees to take him across country to California.  It is during this cross country trip that Bree develops a relationship with her son, all the while keeping their biological connection a secret.  The two eventually end up at her parents home, where the painful secret comes to light.Felicity Huffman (best known for her role as Lynette on television's ""Desperate Housewives"") gives a performance that definitely deserved the accolades she received for it.  Peter Zegers is also really good as Bree's teenage son, who has managed to survive by hustling and uses drugs to numb the pain of his actions.If you are turned off by the idea of a transexual, don't be.  This film is really about the relationships between Bree and her son and her family.

975550,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B000EOTTV8,David Anderson,"[5, 5]","The year 2005 proved to be a great year for GLBT themed films receiving critical success, especially the Oscars.  ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Capote"" are other films note this greatly not just because of their superior film quality.  But because they push barriers that few past filmmakers have dared.  Many have been afraid of this because of fear that their careers will end.  In fact, they have been known to heighten some careers.  ""Transamerica"" is no acception to any of this.""Transamerica"" follows the story of Bree Osbourne, a transsexual woman about to receive the sexual reassessment surgery, who discovers more about herself than she ever imagined.  Her road trip begins when she discovers she has a seventeen year old son Toby, conceived while she still identified as Stanley, who she must bail out of jail.  This begins in New York and ends in Los Angeles.  Through this trail, Bree and Toby reveal secrets about one another that change their lives forever.  Bree slowly realizes that other issues besides her sex organs haunt her.  This leads to realizing their need for acceptance for another.Despite the film title, ""Transamerica"" does not explore transsexuality as much as it may imply.  This is more of a film about acceptance, family, friends, and love.  It stars Emmy and Golden Globe winner Felicity Huffman (""Desperate Housewives""), Kevin Zegers, Fionula Flanagan, and Oscar nominee Burt Young (""Rocky"").  The cast and crew create a beautiful masterpiece that follows the similar idea of past masterpieces ""The Trip To Bountiful"" (1985) and ""Stand By Me"" (1985).  However they add issues that few past films have accomplished so well.  Unlike past trans-issue films like ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999), they combine multiple storyline plots.  ""Transamerica"" created characters that stand out not as their biology or their actions but as human beings living day to day.Through these chain of events, the storyline keeps the emotional value flowing greatly.  The people that Bree and Toby meet keep this film flowing wonderfully while maintaining the theme of Bree and Toby finding themselves.  Despite this being more of revelation film, it fits some educational pieces without losing the theme.  They couldn't have been placed in any better scenes, especially when Bree describes her college studies of transsexuality in evolution.  Every word placed in the film proves that the writers researched these issues thoroughly for an accurate and well-crafted despliction.  More amazing is that within the film, including the DVD cover and the special features, they never label Bree as a man living as a woman.  They use their pronouns exactly as they should where many in society are quick to say he/ she, it, or he.  They portray her as a true woman, whom she is.This film received several award wins and nominations, the most noticeable being Felicity Huffman for Best Actress (Oscar nomination and Golden Globe win).  Her performance was one of the best of 2005 as Bree.  Some may be quick to judge that only her success on ABC's ""Desperate Housewives"" catipulted her nominations.  Her hard work proves not so.  She researched transsexual issues and her character deeply to achieve such an accurate portrayal of Bree.  From her voice to her mannerisms to her emotional struggles, this stands out as Huffman's performance of a lifetime.Though the remaining cast appears briefly, besides Kevin Zegers as Toby, each of them stand out in their performance well.  Through the sensative to the non-accepting, they add their own unforgettable notes.  Their performances truly give the emotional theme necessary to express what's happening in their environment.Behind the storyline and performances is the quality that many forget, the music.  This great series of country music gives the film a great background of the road trip.  This somewhat adds to the geography's southern touch.  The performances and compositions are beautiful.  The film ends with the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated ""Travelin' Thru"" by legendary artist Dolly Parton.  This true stand-out wonderfully speaks of the film in whole with uplift, gospel, and spirituality.  Viewers should expect a 2006 Grammy nomination for Best Song Written For a Film (the Grammy cut-off date is 9/30; the film and the song were released afterwards).Such great film quality makes ""Transamerica"" great for many audiences.  This will surely continue pleasing them for a long time.  Those wanting more should also watch the special features, which feature the film making process through Huffman and Zegers' perspectives and the music video for ""Travelin' Thru"".  The other films listed in this review are also great recommendations.",5,Felicity Huffman Rises As Her Own,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,4692,"['year', '2005', 'proved', 'be', 'great', 'year', 'GLBT', 'themed', 'films', 'receiving', 'critical', 'success', 'especially', 'Oscars', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Capote', 'are', 'other', 'films', 'note', 'greatly', 'not', 'just', 'superior', 'film', 'quality', 'push', 'barriers', 'few', 'past', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'dared', 'Many', 'have', 'been', 'afraid', 'fear', 'careers', 'will', 'end', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'heighten', 'careers', 'Transamerica', 'acception', 'Transamerica', 'story', 'Bree', 'Osbourne', 'transsexual', 'woman', 'receive', 'sexual', 'reassessment', 'surgery', 'who', 'more', 'herself', 'ever', 'imagined', 'road', 'trip', 'when', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Toby', 'conceived', 'still', 'identified', 'Stanley', 'who', 'must', 'bail', 'jail', 'New', 'York', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'trail', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'one', 'change', 'lives', 'forever', 'Bree', 'slowly', 'other', 'issues', 'sex', 'organs', 'haunt', 'realizing', 'need', 'acceptance', 'film', 'title', 'Transamerica', 'not', 'explore', 'transsexuality', 'as', 'much', 'may', 'imply', 'more', 'film', 'acceptance', 'family', 'friends', 'love', 'Emmy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'winner', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'Fionula', 'Flanagan', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Rocky', 'cast', 'crew', 'create', 'beautiful', 'masterpiece', 'similar', 'idea', 'past', 'masterpieces', 'Trip', 'Bountiful', '1985', 'Stand', 'Me', '1985', 'However', 'add', 'issues', 'few', 'past', 'films', 'have', 'accomplished', 'so', 'well', 'past', 'trans-issue', 'films', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', '1999', 'combine', 'multiple', 'storyline', 'plots', 'Transamerica', 'created', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'not', 'biology', 'actions', 'human', 'beings', 'living', 'day', 'day.Through', 'chain', 'events', 'storyline', 'emotional', 'value', 'flowing', 'greatly', 'people', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'meet', 'keep', 'film', 'flowing', 'wonderfully', 'maintaining', 'theme', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'finding', 'being', 'more', 'revelation', 'film', 'educational', 'pieces', 'losing', 'theme', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'placed', 'better', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'Bree', 'college', 'studies', 'transsexuality', 'evolution', 'word', 'placed', 'film', 'writers', 'researched', 'issues', 'thoroughly', 'accurate', 'well-crafted', 'despliction', 'More', 'amazing', 'film', 'including', 'DVD', 'cover', 'special', 'features', 'never', 'label', 'Bree', 'man', 'living', 'woman', 'use', 'pronouns', 'exactly', 'should', 'where', 'many', 'society', 'are', 'quick', 'say', 'he/', 'portray', 'true', 'woman', 'whom', 'film', 'received', 'several', 'award', 'wins', 'nominations', 'most', 'noticeable', 'being', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'win', 'performance', 'was', 'one', 'best', '2005', 'Bree', 'may', 'be', 'quick', 'judge', 'only', 'success', 'ABC', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'catipulted', 'nominations', 'hard', 'work', 'not', 'so', 'researched', 'transsexual', 'issues', 'character', 'deeply', 'achieve', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Bree', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'emotional', 'struggles', 'out', 'Huffman', 'performance', 'lifetime.Though', 'remaining', 'cast', 'briefly', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'Toby', 'stand', 'out', 'performance', 'well', 'sensative', 'non-accepting', 'add', 'own', 'unforgettable', 'notes', 'performances', 'truly', 'give', 'emotional', 'theme', 'necessary', 'express', 'what', 'happening', 'storyline', 'performances', 'quality', 'many', 'forget', 'music', 'great', 'series', 'country', 'music', 'film', 'great', 'background', 'road', 'trip', 'somewhat', 'geography', 'southern', 'touch', 'performances', 'compositions', 'are', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominated', 'Travelin', 'Thru', 'legendary', 'artist', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'true', 'stand-out', 'wonderfully', 'film', 'whole', 'uplift', 'gospel', 'spirituality', 'Viewers', 'should', 'expect', '2006', 'Grammy', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Song', 'Written', 'Film', 'Grammy', 'cut-off', 'date', '9/30', 'film', 'song', 'were', 'released', 'afterwards', '.Such', 'great', 'film', 'quality', 'Transamerica', 'great', 'many', 'audiences', 'will', 'surely', 'continue', 'pleasing', 'long', 'time', 'wanting', 'more', 'should', 'also', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'feature', 'film', 'making', 'process', 'Huffman', 'Zegers', 'perspectives', 'music', 'video', 'Travelin', 'Thru', 'other', 'films', 'listed', 'review', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'recommendations']",N/A

975555,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000EOTTV8,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 8]","Felicity Huffman gives, hands down, one of the sharpest and bravest performances this year as Sabrina ""Bree"" Osbourne, a LA-based transsexual a week away from his/her final operation to rid himself/herself of the genitalia that reminds him/her that he/she was once an unhappy man named Stanley. However, this is not an extended, over-the-top comedy skit, nor a preachy social commentary film on changing sexual roles. Rather, it is an often ribald farce that gains its dramatic resonance from the spiraling convolutions of the plot and an unexpected poignancy at key moments along the way.With his first feature-length film, director-writer Duncan Tucker has fashioned a spirited road movie that matches Bree with the 17-year old son he/she ever knew existed, Toby, a homeless, teenaged delinquent who was the product of Stanley's fumbling attempt at sexual relations with a long-ago girlfriend who recently died. A true odd couple along the lines of Walter Salles's ""Central Station"", Bree and Toby make a cross-country trek from New York, where Toby was in custody, back to LA. It all sounds pretty contrived. However, in conveying Bree's prim manner, academic wellspring of knowledge and droll humor, Huffman grounds the film with an amazingly convincing impersonation of a man on the threshold of becoming a woman physically and struggling to keep up with the gender transition emotionally.Tucker wisely paints Bree's menial job as a telemarketer as a way to disclose that Stanley has been struggling for years to build the self-worth to become a woman, and Huffman responds with her character's weary demeanor and tense posture. In what could have been a minefield of burlesque comedy opportunities, there is not a single false note in her acting, as she makes the controlled lady-like movements and studied vocal intonations believable traits of Bree. She is also made up simply without fuss (an expert job by Jason Hayes) to look credibly like she is precariously on the male-female border with a constant fear of falling back to her character's old self.Fortunately, Huffman is surrounded by a strong supporting cast. Although he often seems to be channeling Edward Furlong and Leonardo Di Caprio in portraying Toby's sullenness, Kevin Zegers captures his character's confusion and angst with emotional accuracy. Tucker also wisely uses some wonderful, under-the-radar actors in key roles - Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a (whom I have not seen since her poignant turn in John Sayles's 1996 ""Lone Star"") as Bree's strong-minded therapist Margaret; Graham Greene (Kicking Bird in ""Dances with Wolves"") as Bree's wishful suitor Calvin Manygoats in a sweetly rendered episode of unrequited love; and a surprisingly laid-back Burt Young (Paulie in all the Rocky films) and an especially histrionic Fionnula Flanagan as Bree's parents heavy in denial over their offspring's decision.In fact, Young, Flanagan and Carrie Preston as Bree's cynical, addiction-recovering sister Sidney are all hilarious in the movie's comedy peak as the dysfunctional family from hell when Bree and Toby barely make it to her hometown, Phoenix, prior to her operation. The family feeds almost too easily into Bree's self-doubt but ultimately acts as most families do when crises occur. The film has a few serious moments that veer toward melodrama to heighten the revelations involved, but Tucker thankfully does not belabor them, favoring instead the shrewd, absurdist comedy elements. This is definitely an unexpected gem worth seeking out.",5,Fearless Performance by Huffman Elevates a Uniquely Enthralling Road Movie,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,3514,"['Felicity', 'Huffman', 'down', 'one', 'sharpest', 'bravest', 'performances', 'year', 'Sabrina', 'Bree', 'Osbourne', 'LA-based', 'transsexual', 'week', 'away', 'final', 'operation', 'rid', 'himself/herself', 'genitalia', 'him/her', 'he/she', 'was', 'once', 'unhappy', 'man', 'named', 'Stanley', 'However', 'not', 'extended', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'skit', 'preachy', 'social', 'commentary', 'film', 'changing', 'sexual', 'roles', 'Rather', 'often', 'ribald', 'farce', 'gains', 'dramatic', 'resonance', 'spiraling', 'convolutions', 'plot', 'unexpected', 'poignancy', 'key', 'moments', 'way.With', 'first', 'feature-length', 'film', 'director-writer', 'Duncan', 'Tucker', 'fashioned', 'spirited', 'road', 'movie', 'Bree', '17-year', 'old', 'son', 'he/she', 'ever', 'knew', 'existed', 'Toby', 'homeless', 'teenaged', 'delinquent', 'who', 'was', 'product', 'Stanley', 'fumbling', 'attempt', 'sexual', 'relations', 'long-ago', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'recently', 'died', 'A', 'true', 'odd', 'couple', 'lines', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'Central', 'Station', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'make', 'cross-country', 'trek', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'Toby', 'was', 'custody', 'back', 'LA', 'pretty', 'contrived', 'However', 'conveying', 'Bree', 'prim', 'manner', 'academic', 'wellspring', 'knowledge', 'droll', 'humor', 'Huffman', 'film', 'amazingly', 'convincing', 'impersonation', 'man', 'threshold', 'becoming', 'woman', 'physically', 'struggling', 'keep', 'up', 'gender', 'transition', 'emotionally.Tucker', 'wisely', 'Bree', 'menial', 'job', 'telemarketer', 'way', 'disclose', 'Stanley', 'been', 'struggling', 'years', 'build', 'self-worth', 'become', 'woman', 'Huffman', 'character', 'weary', 'demeanor', 'tense', 'posture', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'minefield', 'burlesque', 'comedy', 'opportunities', 'not', 'single', 'false', 'note', 'acting', 'controlled', 'lady-like', 'movements', 'studied', 'vocal', 'intonations', 'believable', 'traits', 'Bree', 'also', 'made', 'up', 'simply', 'fuss', 'expert', 'job', 'Jason', 'Hayes', 'look', 'credibly', 'precariously', 'male-female', 'border', 'constant', 'fear', 'falling', 'back', 'character', 'old', 'self.Fortunately', 'Huffman', 'surrounded', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'often', 'be', 'channeling', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'portraying', 'Toby', 'sullenness', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'character', 'confusion', 'angst', 'emotional', 'accuracy', 'Tucker', 'also', 'wisely', 'wonderful', 'under-the-radar', 'actors', 'key', 'roles', 'Elizabeth', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'whom', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'poignant', 'turn', 'John', 'Sayles', '1996', 'Lone', 'Star', 'Bree', 'strong-minded', 'therapist', 'Margaret', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Kicking', 'Bird', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Bree', 'wishful', 'suitor', 'Calvin', 'Manygoats', 'sweetly', 'rendered', 'episode', 'unrequited', 'love', 'surprisingly', 'laid-back', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Paulie', 'Rocky', 'films', 'especially', 'histrionic', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Bree', 'parents', 'heavy', 'denial', 'offspring', 'decision.In', 'fact', 'Young', 'Flanagan', 'Carrie', 'Preston', 'Bree', 'cynical', 'addiction-recovering', 'sister', 'Sidney', 'are', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'comedy', 'peak', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'hell', 'when', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'barely', 'make', 'hometown', 'Phoenix', 'prior', 'operation', 'family', 'almost', 'too', 'easily', 'Bree', 'self-doubt', 'ultimately', 'most', 'families', 'do', 'when', 'crises', 'occur', 'film', 'few', 'serious', 'moments', 'veer', 'melodrama', 'heighten', 'revelations', 'involved', 'Tucker', 'thankfully', 'not', 'belabor', 'favoring', 'instead', 'shrewd', 'absurdist', 'comedy', 'elements', 'definitely', 'unexpected', 'gem', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out']",N/A
975556,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000EOTTV8,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","TRANSAMERICA (2005) was a deeply affecting movie for me. Having just seen it, though it is five years old, I was deeply moved that such a storyline was possible even five years ago. My personal reason for being so touched is that I was lucky enough to befriend one of America's first male-to-female ladies, and that at a time when she was fighting for custody of her son.Felicity Huffman, mainly a well-recognized tv actress, plays the transgendered Bree Osbourne (formerly Stanley Osbourne), a male-to-female who is living fully as female and awaiting surgery. A sudden, mysterious phone call leaves Bree in turmoil. She is told she has a 17-year-old son, Toby (Kevin Zegers). She did not know about him.Firstly, special kudos: Canadian doll Kevin Zegers is one of the most sexy and appealing young stars today. It's sad he's been given no major adult role aside from this one (and the first time I ever saw him, in the unfortunateZoom - Academy for Superheroes, see my review). However, as an actor he has an intriguing distinction: he has twice played a young stigmatist, in ""Shadow Builder"" (1998) and ""The X-Files"" (as Kevin Kryder, episode ""Revelations"", 1995). Actually Zegers has worked a great deal, going back years.Bree travels out of state to bail Toby out of lockup; she is loathe to say anything and spends a large part of the film posing as a ""church lady"". Toby has seen that sort of thing before: he's a drug-addled gay male hustler.What follows is a touching, hilarious and at times downright creepy road trip that is interrupted in a unique way. Bree and Toby explore each other's emotions in a way a typical father and son could never do, and the love is what shines forth in their performances.When I say ""creepy"", I refer to the fact that the plight of a drug-addled 17-year-old prostitute is treated in so blas&eacute; a manner. Many of my young friends have been in similar positions. It is not funny, touching or blas&eacute;.It is a heartbreak, and I wish this film had moved itself away from Bree's character for just a few minutes to concentrate on Toby. A boy like that does not magically heal in a few days, as is portrayed here to a silly extent; nor was I amused by the end of the film which shows him happily achieving his dream of becoming a gay porn star.For that, one star less!Felicity Huffman deserves the high praise for her quirky, incredibly real performance though I'd have preferred someone transgender in this role for obvious reasons. Otherwise, it is often hilarious, with a naturally recurring humor that mimics life - not easy to accomplish with so much heavy emotion and drama.A final note on writer/director Duncan Tucker (The Mountain King [HD]) in only his second time as writer/director. He is brave and he is concentrated. This deservedly praised second outing at the helm must be handled with some care - I consider this film unique and possibly a bit dangerous for the faint of heart. Still I can commend Tucker for this warts-and-all masterpiece.Oh, but Duncan, WHY did you have to show us a son attempting to seduce his father?",4,A little less pink,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,3085,"['TRANSAMERICA', '2005', 'was', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'movie', 'Having', 'just', 'seen', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'storyline', 'was', 'possible', 'even', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'personal', 'reason', 'being', 'so', 'touched', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'befriend', 'one', 'America', 'first', 'male-to-female', 'ladies', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'fighting', 'custody', 'son.Felicity', 'Huffman', 'mainly', 'well-recognized', 'tv', 'actress', 'transgendered', 'Bree', 'Osbourne', 'formerly', 'Stanley', 'Osbourne', 'male-to-female', 'who', 'living', 'fully', 'female', 'awaiting', 'surgery', 'sudden', 'mysterious', 'phone', 'call', 'Bree', 'turmoil', 'told', '17-year-old', 'son', 'Toby', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'about', 'him.Firstly', 'special', 'kudos', 'Canadian', 'doll', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'one', 'most', 'sexy', 'appealing', 'young', 'stars', 'today', 'sad', 'been', 'given', 'major', 'adult', 'role', 'aside', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'unfortunateZoom', 'Academy', 'Superheroes', 'see', 'review', 'However', 'actor', 'intriguing', 'distinction', 'twice', 'played', 'young', 'stigmatist', 'Shadow', 'Builder', '1998', 'X-Files', 'Kevin', 'Kryder', 'episode', 'Revelations', '1995', 'Actually', 'Zegers', 'worked', 'great', 'deal', 'going', 'back', 'years.Bree', 'travels', 'state', 'bail', 'Toby', 'lockup', 'loathe', 'say', 'anything', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'posing', 'church', 'lady', 'Toby', 'seen', 'sort', 'thing', 'drug-addled', 'gay', 'male', 'hustler.What', 'touching', 'hilarious', 'times', 'downright', 'creepy', 'road', 'trip', 'interrupted', 'unique', 'way', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'explore', 'other', 'emotions', 'way', 'typical', 'father', 'son', 'could', 'never', 'do', 'love', 'what', 'forth', 'performances.When', 'say', 'creepy', 'refer', 'fact', 'plight', 'drug-addled', '17-year-old', 'prostitute', 'treated', 'so', 'blas', 'eacute', 'manner', 'Many', 'young', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'similar', 'positions', 'not', 'funny', 'touching', 'blas', 'eacute', '.It', 'heartbreak', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'moved', 'away', 'Bree', 'character', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'concentrate', 'Toby', 'boy', 'not', 'magically', 'heal', 'few', 'days', 'portrayed', 'here', 'silly', 'extent', 'was', 'amused', 'end', 'film', 'happily', 'achieving', 'dream', 'becoming', 'gay', 'porn', 'star.For', 'one', 'star', 'less', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'high', 'praise', 'quirky', 'incredibly', 'real', 'performance', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'someone', 'transgender', 'role', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Otherwise', 'often', 'hilarious', 'naturally', 'recurring', 'humor', 'mimics', 'life', 'not', 'easy', 'accomplish', 'so', 'much', 'heavy', 'emotion', 'drama.A', 'final', 'note', 'writer/director', 'Duncan', 'Tucker', 'Mountain', 'King', '[', 'HD', ']', 'only', 'second', 'time', 'writer/director', 'brave', 'concentrated', 'deservedly', 'praised', 'second', 'outing', 'helm', 'must', 'be', 'handled', 'care', 'consider', 'film', 'unique', 'possibly', 'bit', 'dangerous', 'faint', 'heart', 'Still', 'can', 'commend', 'Tucker', 'warts-and-all', 'masterpiece.Oh', 'Duncan', 'WHY', 'did', 'have', 'show', 'son', 'attempting', 'seduce', 'father']",N/A

""Transamerica"" is one of the few films I felt was one of the best. It was both heartfelt and funny. Felicity Huffman should have won best actress for her role in this excellent film.Felicity Huffman plays Bree, a woman who is on the verge of completing her transformation to be a woman completely. She finds out via a telephone call that she has a son from a college fling she had when she was still a man. Posing as a Christian missionary and a friend of the son's father when her therapist (Elizabeth Pena) insists that she goes see her son, Bree goes to bail out Toby (Kevin Zegers) in NYC. She reluctantly takes Toby on a criss country drive back to California. She has only a week to get back before her operation.The week long journey in the car is momentous life changing experience for both Bree and Toby but especially for Bree. There was a good mix of comedy and drama through out the film. It wasn't unrealistically sweet or over the top dramatic. Felicity Huffman's portrayal was dead on and very realistic, as well as sympathetic. The way she was trained to speak in the film was especially realistic to me. The most heartbreaking momentfor me in the film was when Bree and Toby went to visit Bree's family. I can only imagine that this scenario would be very relatable to the members of transgendered communities across the country. The acting was superb in the film and writing was top notch.

She bails him out of jail and then, learning that he wants to go to Los Angeles to find his father, she hopes to help him and herself by driving him to California. Throughout their journey, Bree struggles to keep the fact that she is Toby's father from him while at the same time trying to become closer to him, eventually becoming the strong woman she always knew she could be. A touching and very human movie about family, filled with much humor and sensitivity. Duncan Tucker's script is flawless and lays out the universal struggles of all families: communication, unconditional love, rebellion against parents, being true to one's self. Felicity Huffman's portrayal of Bree is remarkable. She brings much dignity to her character and allows the audience to see beyond what the eyes see into the heart of her character. Kevin Zegers gives a fine performance as Toby, struggling to find his own identity in the world.

It is a powerful film balanced with comedy and drama in just the right proportions to keep it sailing along above the speed limit.Bree (Felicity Huffman) is in the final stages of her transsexual transformation, having completed the cross-dressing requirement, the hormones, the facial surgeries, and the psychological counseling with Margaret (Elizabeth Pena), and is ready for her long awaited gender transformation surgery.  Abruptly she receives a call from New York authorities, who have in custody a lad arrested for hustling and drugs, who claim Bree  to be the father.  Unwillingly at first (her surgery date is could be affected) she is convinced by her therapist Margaret that she must confront this part of her past before her doctor will sign for the surgery.  She flies to New York, claims her son Toby (Kevin Zegers) without allowing Toby to know the truth, and acting the role of a church lady is ultimately committed to driving him to California.  A quick stop in Kentucky reveals Toby's sad background (his mother committed suicide and his stepfather abuses him sexually), and Bree is determined to rescue Toby from all this.  The trip to California is interrupted by a stop with Bree's grossly dysfunctional parents and sister (Fionnula Flanagan, Burt Young, Carrie Preston) who though ashamed of Bree's life choice are taken with their 'new' grandson.  Toby has been a difficult passenger, doing drugs, seeing Bree with her male genitals showing, witnessing a Mary Kaye party with transsexuals, etc, but never the less he and Bree have bonded.  When Toby discovers that Bree is actually his father he naturally rebels, only to realize after Bree has had her surgery in California that Bree is the only family he has.Huffman gives a bravura performance as Bree, never stepping over the line of farce, always attentive to the role-playing that has usurped her life, always able to find the gentle comedy that occurs with Toby, make her introduction to a male suitor Calvin (Graham Greene) who offers the two a ride once their car is stolen a tender moment of vulnerability, and yet is able to show us the angst of the transsexual dilemma in a powerfully touching scene with the fine Elizabeth Pena.  Likewise, Kevin Zegers (a fine young Canadian actor with a long list of credentials in TV and film) is wholly credible as a lost youth with deep and longstanding emotional needs hiding behind a mask of street hustler. And the supporting cast is exactly that - brilliantly supporting.But the bulk of the kudos go to writer/director Duncan Tucker.  The screenplay is superbly written and the direction of this talented cast is so well focused that there isn't a wasted moment of film.  This is a story about the need for belonging, for being true to yourself, for loving yourself so that you can truly love others.  Many fine lessons here, and delivered in a package that is absolutely irresistible.  Highly recommended for all audiences.

The introduction of characters, their realistic sides, the adventurous zig to the story, the way the story unfolds, the music to the film and the awkwardness which is made to look easy going is where the film masters.With every passing minute, this film adds to it's intent. The acting is crisp and their is no conscious effort at the hands of the director to deliver the message to the audience. Obviously, this film deals with a sensitive issues for those concerned. Felicity Huffman (I didnt know her name until after I watched the film) does a good job. Her seventeen year old son,the character, Toby somehow was the best character of the film. His laidback quiet stupid self,whether you agree or disagree, did add a lot of calm to the film.My absolute favourite scene in the film involves Toby kissing a teenage girl who's licking a lollipop. No, I havent spoilt your film yet so don't worry on it. It's strange yet beleivable how Stanley's family deals with his/her sex change operation.

Ms. Huffman was nominated for an Oscar-- surely no actress gave a better performance in 2005 than she-- for her work in this film, which has to be one of the best of the year.Just before having the surgery that will finally change her from a man to a woman, Bree (Huffman) learns that she may be the father of a wayward seventeen-year-old hustler son-- who, by the way, still sleeps with a stuffed animal-- Toby played by Zegers. Posing as a religious do-gooder, Bree half-heartedly rescues Toby from a life of hustling; and the two embark on a road trip across America (trans America) with their ultimate destination being Los Angeles, where Bree will have her surgery. What transpires-- there's that ""trans"" word again-- is ultimately a beautiful love story between one pre-op transexual and her long lost son. Much of the movie will make you laugh; parts of it will practically make you cry as these two outsider characters find out things about each other and themselves that they have never dreamed of before. While much of the plot is predictable-- this is not a criticism-- there are a couple of twists that you probably will not expect.Although Huffman is perfect as a pre-op transexual, from her dress to her voice-- somewhere between a baritone and an alto-- to her mannerisms as she tries so hard to become she woman she wants to be, Zegers gives her a run for her money, vascillating from the tough punk hustler to the child who really desperately wants to be loved by a parent.The film also boasts a fine soundtrack, ending with a cut by Dolly Parton, certainly a performer who knows all about what is real and what isn't.TRANSAMERICA is what you expect from a European art film, not most of the films coming out of Hollywood.

975570,A3RO6CB4EU8DRA,B000EOTTV8,James Head,"[3, 3]","First, let me point out that the transgender issue does *not* take the forefront in this film.  Despite the title, which most attribute to the main character's journey from a man to a woman, it means much more than that.  The prefix ""trans"" implies a crossing or a journey, in this case both literally (across the country, from New York to Los Angeles) and figuratively (as Bree gains the understanding of what is truly important in her life).Without a doubt, Felicity Huffman is brilliant and truly remarkable in her role as Bree Osbourne, a transgendered individual whose life is anything but simple.  Even in the opening minutes of the film, it becomes crystal clear that her primary focus is on completing her transformation by undergoing her scheduled gender reassignment surgery.  She is deceived when she thinks this will be a simple process, as she soon sets out on a trip to bail a young man out of jail.  There's one catch:  the young man is her son and only knows that he hasn't seen his father (Huffman) in years.A journey of discovery soon follows, as Bree travels with young Toby cross-country.  As they begin to understand one another, Bree struggles with the notion of telling Toby the truth.  It is only then that she begins to understand that there might be other important things in her life that she never before considered.Felicity Huffman should be commended for her portrayal of the proper yet outspoken Bree.  Her performance is, at times, heartwrenching yet astute, and in every scene she is right on the mark.  Kevin Zegers also does a strong job of playing the misguided Toby, a teenager with countless problems who seems to secretly long for a loving parent to hold onto.Don't be fooled, however -- in spite of the many wry, witty moments, TRANSAMERICA runs in a vein much deeper than a conventional comedy:  it is, at the same time, a powerful story of love and the struggle of self-discovery.  Rent or buy it with an open mind, and you're sure not to be disappointed.

Transamerica is the story of a very compassionate transsexual, Bree (played by Felicity Huffman) that finds out on the eve of her gender surgery that she fathered a son, 17 years prior. Her therapist won't sign off on her operation until she makes peace with her prior demons. So is the tale of Transamerica...Felicity Huffman deserves to win the Oscar. She was funny, entertaining, and very convincing playing Bree, the very determined pre-op female. Bree is not the ""stereotypical transsexual"" that bigots like society to believe in. Aside from the physical plumbing, Bree is no different from any other moralistic lady. The character of the very persecuted Toby (played by Kevin Zegers) was enthralling because he had many dimensions. When he tried to seduce Bree I couldn't help but think he was a poor lost soul that needed a lot of guidance and help. But Bree never judged him, probably because she first knew what it felt like to be judged unmercifully. Bree is both an excellent mother, and father.I picked up this soundtrack prior to seeing this movie because I LOVE the theme song by Dolly Parton, ""Travelin Thru."" This song wraps up the entire movie in a nutshell and I strongly recommend getting the CD if you enjoyed the movie, or if you enjoy Dolly.This movie is very funny, somewhat sad, but light-hearted at the same time.

About responsibility, acceptance and even love.  It speaks of the pain of life that intrudes and sometimes rules us.  Bree becomes more beautiful as the adversity mounts because more and more her true self is allowed to come out, she learns to be comfortable as herself.  Truth will out, a phrase from the Merchant of Venice comes to mind.  How often when we fear the truth inspite of coming from an innocent or an unwitting happenstance, it becomes a destructive thing when finally finally it comes out.  There the pain and fear in the waiting / holding off and the compounding when a lie is one of silence and omission. When it comes it is terrible.  But it comes none the less.If you are transphobic but have some sense of open mindedness you might give this a try, it may help you understand those you do not know.  If you are of the Abomination crowd, why bother, your mind is already made up, the last thing Our Savior would want you to do is have any compassion or understanding for such people.  Christ without compassion is that your version of Christianity?If you have the concept of it is not authentic enough,  write your own movie.  Make it and we'll all hope for critical acclaim.  Sometimes if you are too close to something you get a myopic view and don't see the big picture.  If you concentrate on finding fault guess what you'll find.  And you won't be able enjoy it because you won't see the good side.This was well done and clearly a subject that many cannot abide.  OK start castigating me.

In TRANSAMERICA, Huffman has a Big Screen gig that should indisputably prove that she's an actress of considerable ability. The other desperate housewives, actresses Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, and Nicolette Sheridan, can only stand back and envy.Here, Huffman is Bree Osbourne, born Stanley, a California man on the verge of the very last stage of his transgender transference, i.e. genital surgery that will, as he puts it, convert his ""outey"" to an ""inney"". In every other way, Stanley/Bree already presents to society as a female. What has otherwise been a relatively smooth transition hits a bump when Bree discovers, and must bail out of a New York City jail, his 17-year old transient son, Toby (Kevin Zegers), conceived in a long-ago liaison with a since-deceased girlfriend. Bree's problem is how to get Toby back to the Golden State without revealing to the teenager their biological relationship and the former's genetic gender. What's a poor girl to do?When the creators were sitting around the table discussing casting for this clever film, there had to have been some argument. Do they find a man to play a man morphing to a woman, or a woman to play a man morphing to a woman? Their choice of Huffman was inspired, and it pays off brilliantly. This is perhaps not surprising as the excellent actor William H. Macy is the movie's producer (and, also, Huffman's real-life hubby). Indeed, Felicity's performance is eminently Oscar-worthy, and will be a definite eye-opener to audiences that are only familiar with her DH persona. Also notable in brief supporting roles are Graham Greene as the Navaho rancher, Calvin Manygoats, who gives Bree and Toby a ride after their car is stolen in New Mexico, and Fionnula Flanagan as Bree's distraught and resentful Jewish mother.On the surface, TRANSAMERICA is a four-star, insightful, poignant, and amusing look at the practical problems associated with transgender transition. Huffman's performance, the best I can recall by an actress since Charlize Theron's triumph in MONSTER, elevates it to five-star, must-see status.",5,A desperate housewife like you've never seen her,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2278,"['Felicity', 'Huffman', 'desperate', 'housewife', 'Lynette', 'Scavo', 'popular', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'DESPERATE', 'HOUSEWIVES', 'occasionally', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'also', 'Desperately', 'Silly', 'TRANSAMERICA', 'Huffman', 'Big', 'Screen', 'gig', 'should', 'indisputably', 'prove', 'actress', 'considerable', 'ability', 'other', 'desperate', 'housewives', 'actresses', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'Marcia', 'Cross', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'Nicolette', 'Sheridan', 'can', 'only', 'stand', 'back', 'envy.Here', 'Huffman', 'Bree', 'Osbourne', 'born', 'Stanley', 'California', 'man', 'verge', 'very', 'last', 'stage', 'transgender', 'transference', 'i.e', 'genital', 'surgery', 'will', 'convert', 'outey', 'inney', 'other', 'way', 'Stanley/Bree', 'already', 'society', 'female', 'What', 'otherwise', 'been', 'relatively', 'smooth', 'transition', 'bump', 'when', 'Bree', 'discovers', 'must', 'bail', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'jail', '17-year', 'old', 'transient', 'son', 'Toby', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'conceived', 'long-ago', 'liaison', 'since-deceased', 'girlfriend', 'Bree', 'problem', 'how', 'get', 'Toby', 'back', 'Golden', 'State', 'revealing', 'teenager', 'biological', 'relationship', 'former', 'genetic', 'gender', 'What', 'poor', 'girl', 'do', 'When', 'creators', 'were', 'sitting', 'table', 'discussing', 'casting', 'clever', 'film', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'argument', 'Do', 'find', 'man', 'play', 'man', 'morphing', 'woman', 'woman', 'play', 'man', 'morphing', 'woman', 'choice', 'Huffman', 'was', 'inspired', 'off', 'brilliantly', 'perhaps', 'not', 'surprising', 'excellent', 'actor', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'movie', 'producer', 'also', 'Huffman', 'real-life', 'hubby', 'Indeed', 'Felicity', 'performance', 'eminently', 'Oscar-worthy', 'will', 'be', 'definite', 'eye-opener', 'audiences', 'are', 'only', 'familiar', 'DH', 'persona', 'Also', 'notable', 'brief', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Navaho', 'rancher', 'Calvin', 'Manygoats', 'who', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'ride', 'car', 'stolen', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Bree', 'distraught', 'resentful', 'Jewish', 'mother.On', 'surface', 'TRANSAMERICA', 'four-star', 'insightful', 'poignant', 'amusing', 'look', 'practical', 'problems', 'associated', 'transgender', 'transition', 'Huffman', 'performance', 'best', 'can', 'recall', 'actress', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'triumph', 'MONSTER', 'five-star', 'must-see', 'status']",N/A

I liked the intelligent decision to make Felicity Huffman's Bree character have to confront another big issue- the sudden emergence of an unknown son- in addition to the huge issue of her final transformation from man to woman.  But, on top of that, I really liked that the movie gave us a lot of variety just within the personality of Bree herself.  She displayed all kinds of interests throughout the movie, including earth history (she tells her son about the dinosaurs that used to roam around in the area their car was traversing) and proper usage of the English language.  On this latter point, she was a bit annoying- with her constant correcting of her son's grammar- but that gave her character further nuance, too.I also liked the naturalistic feel of the movie.  It must have been tempting to include more ""big"" moments when it was time for a confrontation, revelation, or resolution, but the movie mostly goes for a more realistic feel, where it's clear that life goes on and there will still be positive and negative things to deal with even after a life-changing development or catharis.The DVD includes a nice selection of extras, including a pair of interviews where the director chats with his stars.

I love Reese Witherspoon, but I'm not sure how she beat Huffman. The movie ""Transamerica"" is a funny, poignant, and at times disturbing film that decieves you with the title. The film, as you may have read already, uses the transsexual aspect merrely a backdrop. The movie stars Huffman as Bree, formerly Stanley, a transsexual woman who's sex change is in less than a week. Everything is set, until Bree recieves a phone call from the New York City Police Department telling her that her son has been arrested. Turns out Bree had a fling in college. Her therapist tells her that she will not sign the papers needed for the surgery, unless Bree connects with her son. Her son is Toby (Kevin Zegers, a long way from ""Air Bud"" here), a deeply disturbed street hustler and drug addict. Bree is hesistant about revealing her identity to Toby, so she gives him the impression she works for a church that helps troubled youth. As Bree and Toby begin a long drive, they make a few stops. One of them is at Toby's sexually abusive step-father's house (his mother committed suicide), another involves an Indian man (Graham Greene, in a strong supporting performance) who gives them a ride, and eventually at Bree's parents house. Writer/Director Duncan Tucker had a lot of directions he could've gone with this film; I don't know if you can necessarily categorize the film as a drama or a comedy, but it's definitley perfect in the way it was made. All the actors turn in strong work and I'm really surprised that Felicity Huffman didn't nab an Oscar. Being heterosexual, some of the scenes in the film are a little bit hard to handle, especially some of the scenes involving Zegers. Coming from movies such as Air Bud, Wrong Turn, and Dawn of the Dead; the former child actor is showing some bright starpower. Anyway, I know I've praised almost everything about the film there are still a few downsides to it; It drags at points and little things so it's not quite a 5 star film but it's worth checking out.GRADE: B+",4,Felicity Huffman is Amazing,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,2121,"['Oscar', 'Nominee', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Transamerica', 'delivered', 'best', 'performance', '2005', 'film', 'love', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'beat', 'Huffman', 'movie', 'Transamerica', 'funny', 'poignant', 'times', 'disturbing', 'film', 'title', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'read', 'already', 'transsexual', 'aspect', 'merrely', 'backdrop', 'movie', 'Huffman', 'Bree', 'formerly', 'Stanley', 'transsexual', 'woman', 'who', 'sex', 'change', 'less', 'week', 'Everything', 'set', 'Bree', 'phone', 'call', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Police', 'Department', 'telling', 'son', 'been', 'arrested', 'out', 'Bree', 'had', 'fling', 'college', 'therapist', 'will', 'not', 'sign', 'papers', 'needed', 'surgery', 'Bree', 'connects', 'son', 'son', 'Toby', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'long', 'way', 'Air', 'Bud', 'here', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'street', 'hustler', 'drug', 'addict', 'Bree', 'hesistant', 'revealing', 'identity', 'Toby', 'impression', 'church', 'troubled', 'youth', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'begin', 'long', 'drive', 'make', 'few', 'stops', 'One', 'Toby', 'sexually', 'abusive', 'step-father', 'house', 'mother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Indian', 'man', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'strong', 'supporting', 'performance', 'who', 'ride', 'eventually', 'Bree', 'parents', 'house', 'Writer/Director', 'Duncan', 'Tucker', 'had', 'lot', 'directions', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'necessarily', 'categorize', 'film', 'drama', 'comedy', 'definitley', 'perfect', 'way', 'was', 'made', 'actors', 'turn', 'strong', 'work', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'did', ""n't"", 'nab', 'Oscar', 'Being', 'heterosexual', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'hard', 'handle', 'especially', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Zegers', 'Coming', 'movies', 'such', 'Air', 'Bud', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'former', 'child', 'actor', 'showing', 'bright', 'starpower', 'Anyway', 'know', ""'ve"", 'praised', 'almost', 'everything', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'downsides', 'points', 'little', 'things', 'not', 'quite', '5', 'star', 'film', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

Up until the surgery she's doing everything by the book: taking her hormones, practicing with voice tapes to speak in a more feminine tone, and speaking with her therapist to ensure that she's ready for the transition.  Everything is going well until she receives a call that Stanley's son (Toby) is in prison in New York and is calling his father to bail him out.  Thus begins the breakdown that sends Bree to her therapist's office to try to sort out the mess that has become her life.This film isn't as serious as it might seem and the transgender story plays second fiddle to that of a parent getting to know the son she didn't know existed.  It is compounded by the fact that Bree can't tell Toby that she's biologically his father, but she also can't turn her back on him.  Because her therapist won't consent to her sex change operation unless she makes an effort to get to know her son, Bree travels to New York to bail Toby out of jail.  Little does she know that he's been working as a hustler and has a drug problem.Bree decides to let Toby come with her on her journey across the country to be in LA in time for her sex change operation.  This gives them time to get to know each other and for Bree to try to talk Toby out of his intended LA career (porn star).  Along the way they meet many interesting characters including a peyote-eating hippie with ulterior motives, a Native American man with a crush on Bree, and Bree's family who has yet to see the physical changes she's undergone.Having seen none of the original reviews or trailers, I rented this film and hoped for the best.  I wasn't disappointed.  Also, even though Felicity Huffman is the one who was nominated for an Oscar, in my opinion it is Fionnula Flanagan (Bree's mother) who shines in every scene she's in.

975585,AZ78HT7H9DVJG,B000EOTTV8,LARRY,"[0, 1]","I thought that *Transamerica* was a wonderful endearing movie.Bree is just about to get her final surgery after getting the final approval from her doctor and therapist.  However, she gets an unexpected call from Toby, who claims to be her alleged son.  Toby is in jail, for prostitution and drug possession, in NYC when he made the call.  When Bree's therapist discover about the call, she holds back the approval for surgery, thus frustrating Bree.Bree thinks that if she bails him out and sends him to his mother, all will be solved.  So she flies over and bails him out.  From there, Bree learns that the mother is dead.  However, there is a stepfather in Kentucky.  She's determined to drive him there, despite his protests.The drive across America, from NYC to Kentucky to Arizona to California test Bree and Toby.  Bree is determined to hide the fact that s/he is indeed the father.  The guilt builds in Bree every time that Toby mentions the desire to see and live with his father.  On the other hand, Bree is developing a slow awkward bond for Toby.The best part of the whole movie is when Bree and Toby make a stop in Phoenix to see her parents and sister.  Bree may have been estranged from her family and has developed her own indentity.  However, nothing changes in the eyes of their parents, including their stubborness to call her Stanley, her given name.  Bree's mother truly cracks me up, especially at the restaurant.Overall, this movie is about the pursuit of happiness.  However, just what one must do to achieve happiness.  Must one employ lies, estrangement, denial?  There are those that will not accept your path to happiness.  There are those that encourage you to chase happiness.  There are those that don't care.  Regardless, only you will determine or allow what may stand in your way to happiness.*Transamerica* is worth a watch.  You'll laugh.  You might cry.  You'll gasp in shock.

975587,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EOTTV8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 1]","In the last chapter of ""The World According to Garp,"" John Irving tells us what happens to all of the characters who survive the death of the title character.  One of these is Roberta Muldoon, a transsexual who was once a tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles.  After Roberta's death there is a moment of silence before the team's next came and one of the announcers says that Roberta ""didda lot for people wid complicated lives.""  But in the world of transsexuals, Roberta Muldoon has nothing on Bree Osbourne (Felicity Huffman), who is one week away from her surgery when ""Transamerica"" begins.Bree is short for Sabrina, which is the name that Stanley has chosen.  The only problem is that she suddenly gets a phone call and learns that 17 years ago during the one sexual encounter that probably confirmed she was in the wrong body, she fathered a son, Toby (Kevin Zegers), who is in jail.  This bolt from the blue is upsetting enough, but her therapist (Elizabeth Pena) insists that Bree must meet the son and come to terms with the situation before the surgery can be allowed.  So Bree travels from Los Angeles to New York to get Toby out of jail.  She can hardly tell the boy that she is his father, so she says instead that she has been sent from a Christian group to save his soul.  Toby needs saving because unsatisfied with being a street hustler his ambition is now to become a porn star.  Consequently, a car ride to Los Angeles sounds like a great idea to him.  Of course ride gives Bree and Toby a chance to find out about each other before the truth of their relationship is revealed.If there is anything that anybody knows about ""Transamerica"" it is Huffman's Oscar nominated performance, and while it is impossible to quantify how many Academy voters actually saw the film or how many think of her as either being ""just"" a television actress or the role as being similar to what recent Oscar winners in the Best Actress category have done, it is hard not to feel that those were part of the equation that would explain why she did not win.  It might take you a couple of viewings to really appreciate what she is doing here in playing a man trying to be a woman, because a lot of it is subtle work.  But it is a captivating performance and Huffman is helped by the script that director Duncan Tucker (""The Mountain King"") has written, which makes it clear that Bree does not just want to be a woman, she wants to be a lady.  That sensibility is key in her interactions with Toby as is how the situation confronts her with a third option, namely being a mother, even if the great irony here is that she is his father.""Transamerica"" has its comic moments, most notably when Bree and Toby end up at her parent's house, where her father, Murray (Burt Young) says they still love their son, but her mother, Elizabeth (Fionnula Flanagan) quickly adds that they do not respect him.  But the key encounter for Bree comes at the low point in the journey, when getting back to Los Angeles in time for her operation seems like it is not going to happen, and she meets Calvin (Graham Greene).  The easy way of describing what happens is that Calvin hits on Bree.  But what is important is that he acts like a gentleman, which means he treats her like a lady.  I think this is a pivotal moment because if she can be a lady, then everything else is within her reach as well.  Final Note:  When I first saw the DVD cover I could not believe they would have a photograph of Huffman and not as her character, but it turns out this is one of those covers where the two images switch back and forth depending on how you are looking at them.  Still, the point is to forget the actress is playing the character, so I still find it a bit tacky (can you imagine them doing it for John Hurt in ""The Elephant Man?"").",5,Felicity Huffman as a man who wants to be a woman and has to be a mom,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,3807,"['last', 'chapter', 'World', 'According', 'Garp', 'John', 'Irving', 'what', 'characters', 'who', 'survive', 'death', 'title', 'character', 'One', 'Roberta', 'Muldoon', 'transsexual', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'tight', 'end', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'Roberta', 'death', 'moment', 'silence', 'team', 'next', 'came', 'one', 'announcers', 'Roberta', 'didda', 'lot', 'people', 'wid', 'complicated', 'lives', 'world', 'transsexuals', 'Roberta', 'Muldoon', 'nothing', 'Bree', 'Osbourne', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'who', 'one', 'week', 'away', 'surgery', 'when', 'Transamerica', 'begins.Bree', 'short', 'Sabrina', 'name', 'Stanley', 'chosen', 'only', 'problem', 'suddenly', 'phone', 'call', '17', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'probably', 'confirmed', 'was', 'wrong', 'body', 'fathered', 'son', 'Toby', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'who', 'jail', 'bolt', 'blue', 'upsetting', 'enough', 'therapist', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'Bree', 'must', 'meet', 'son', 'come', 'terms', 'situation', 'surgery', 'can', 'be', 'allowed', 'So', 'Bree', 'travels', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'New', 'York', 'get', 'Toby', 'jail', 'can', 'hardly', 'tell', 'boy', 'father', 'instead', 'been', 'sent', 'Christian', 'group', 'save', 'soul', 'Toby', 'saving', 'unsatisfied', 'being', 'street', 'hustler', 'ambition', 'now', 'become', 'porn', 'star', 'Consequently', 'car', 'ride', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'great', 'idea', 'course', 'ride', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'chance', 'find', 'out', 'other', 'truth', 'relationship', 'revealed.If', 'anything', 'anybody', 'Transamerica', 'Huffman', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'impossible', 'quantify', 'how', 'many', 'Academy', 'voters', 'actually', 'saw', 'film', 'how', 'many', 'think', 'being', 'just', 'television', 'actress', 'role', 'being', 'similar', 'what', 'recent', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Best', 'Actress', 'category', 'have', 'done', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'were', 'part', 'equation', 'would', 'explain', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'might', 'take', 'couple', 'viewings', 'really', 'appreciate', 'what', 'doing', 'here', 'playing', 'man', 'trying', 'be', 'woman', 'lot', 'subtle', 'work', 'captivating', 'performance', 'Huffman', 'helped', 'script', 'director', 'Duncan', 'Tucker', 'Mountain', 'King', 'written', 'clear', 'Bree', 'not', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'woman', 'be', 'lady', 'sensibility', 'key', 'interactions', 'Toby', 'how', 'situation', 'third', 'option', 'namely', 'being', 'mother', 'even', 'great', 'irony', 'here', 'father', 'Transamerica', 'comic', 'moments', 'most', 'notably', 'when', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'end', 'up', 'parent', 'house', 'where', 'father', 'Murray', 'Burt', 'Young', 'still', 'love', 'son', 'mother', 'Elizabeth', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'quickly', 'do', 'not', 'respect', 'key', 'encounter', 'Bree', 'low', 'point', 'journey', 'when', 'getting', 'back', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'time', 'operation', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'Calvin', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'easy', 'way', 'describing', 'what', 'Calvin', 'hits', 'Bree', 'what', 'important', 'gentleman', 'lady', 'think', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'can', 'be', 'lady', 'then', 'everything', 'else', 'reach', 'as', 'well', 'Final', 'Note', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'DVD', 'cover', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'photograph', 'Huffman', 'not', 'character', 'out', 'one', 'covers', 'where', 'two', 'images', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', 'depending', 'how', 'are', 'looking', 'Still', 'point', 'forget', 'actress', 'playing', 'character', 'still', 'find', 'bit', 'tacky', 'can', 'imagine', 'doing', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Elephant', 'Man']",N/A
975588,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000EOTTV8,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 3]","""Transamerica"" never played in the movie theatre in our little town of Greenville, North Carolina.  So being somewhat in the cinematic sticks, it's a real thrill to finally get to watch Felicity Huffman's Oscar-nominated performance.  Wow!  My supposition before seeing the film was that it was going to hinge mostly on her makeup and ability to look masculine.  What most impressed me about her performance was the tenderness in the relationship that grows between Bree/Stanley and her son Toby.  Ultimately, memorable films aren't about special effects, but about the relationships between characters.  Huffman explored so many level of insecurity with her own personal identity, but then was able to overcome them to that critical moment where she reveals herself as his father to Toby.  Huffman fully deserved this nomination.As Toby, Kevin Zegers finally pulls out of the shadow a bit.  I can see that he's done quite a bit of work, but I certainly would never have recognized him.  As Toby, the young street hustler, he has the required chip on his shoulder.  The best moment for him was when he finally is brought together again with his stepfather who has sexually abused him and Zegers explodes with fury, disgust and pain.  It was an excellent performance.The other characters did good jobs.  It was nice to see Burt Young again as Bree's father Murray.  It's been a long time since his Best Supporting Actor nomination for ""Rocky"" in 1976!  Graham Green does a nice job as the lonely farmer Calvin who befriends Bree.  Elizabeth Pena from ""Rush Hour"" and ""Lone Star"" does a nice job as the firm therapist who causes Bree to face her past before moving into her future.  Fionnnula Flanagan from ""Four Brothers"" and ""The Others"" does a fine performance as the mother Elizabeth who doesn't have the capacity to understand or accept her son/daughter's new identity.  Grant Monohon makes a memorable full frontal appearance as the hitchhiker who seems so new age enlightened and winds up driving away as a carjacker.  Dolly Parton's Best Song nomination was also a delight over the closing titles.While this film received a lot of buzz because of the transsexual content, it ultimately succeeds as Duncan Tucker's first directorial effort because it seems to be about real people.

I can understand why because it is a difficult, complex and subtle role and requires fine acting ability.  She sure does show it too.  She's cast a woman named Bree, formerly known as a man named Sidney.  She's has been living as a woman for several years and is about to undergo a sex change operation, been working hard to achieve this goal, undergoing years of physiological therapy and always wears lace and satin and meticulous makeup.  She's a quiet person with a deep sense of decorum and works hard at two jobs in order to save up the money for the operation.  She feels she is a woman in every way but one.Then, from out of the blue, she discovers that she has fathered a son 17 years before.  The young man, played by Kevin Zegers, is a street hustler.  She lives in Los Angeles but she flies to New York to bail him out of jail.  And now begins their cross country drive to the west coast.  She has to be back in LA for the surgery.  And he wants to go west so he can become a porn star.  She doesn't tell him her true identity.  He thinks she is a church lady who wants to reform him.The scene is now set for conflict and drama.  Some of it is humorous but the humor is a quiet chuckle, not the kind that makes me laugh out loud.  Mostly, it made me do some deep thinking about human nature.  I enjoyed the film with one caveat however.  Felicity Huffman never seemed like a man.  She was always a woman to me.  Maybe that's because I've seen her work in Desperate Housewives which is very much about women.

975592,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000EOTTV8,Mark,"[3, 3]","Duncan Tucker's Transamerica could have easily been a docu-drama about life as a gender dysphoric individual, but instead transsexualism is merely a backdrop for the real story.  The fact that Bree Osbourne (Academy Award Nominee Felicity Huffman) is really a man does not overshadow or overpower the other interesting points in the story.  Yes, her (I will refer to Bree as a her from now on, since that's what the movie seems to do) sex does play into certain positions, but the film is really about two very unique people trying to form a steady relationship.  The film starts with Bree trying to get a form signed to give her permission to undergo gender reassignment surgery (as she later says, ""They don't cut it off, you just have an inny instead of an outy."").  Her therapist does not give the permission, however, when Bree discovers that she fathered a son (it does sound wierd at first, but you'll get used to it after watching the film) before she had any plastic surgery, and when she lived her life as Stanley.  Bree travels from Los Angeles to a New York Prison where her illeged son Toby is being held for being a male prostitute.  In an attempt to get her therapist to sign the consent form, she embarks on a road trip cross country.  At first, she hopes to dump Toby off with his stepfather (his mother is dead) in Kentucky, but in a turn of events that isn't really all that shocking, they are forced to leave and head west towards Los Angeles, where Toby hopes to make it in the adult film industry.  On the way, Bree makes attempts, most of them failures, at parenting, but she soon discovers that it is extremely difficult when she learns of his addiction to cocaine and his constant troublemaking.  Toby and Bree couldn't be more opposite, transgender issues aside.  Toby is a ""free spirit"" who goes where he wants and does what he wants, whereas Bree is a conservative rule-follower (""I had to sleep on the ground last night!  With bugs!).  They get about to Texas, where Toby learns of Bree's real sex and they pick up a hitchhiker who steals their car.  After riding in the back of a truck with some migrant workers, they come to a bar, where we meet Calvin (Graham Greene), a Native American with a not so native name.  Bree and Calvin form a strong relationship, and if left up to Calvin, he would have continued it much further, but, alas, they must indeed move on.  In what is really the last leg of the journey, Bree must move to a last resort decision and ask her parents for help getting to Los Angeles.  This is the most interesting part of the film, and it makes the right decision to be funny, but at the same time to not take the seriousness off of the confrontation between Bree and her parents, especially her mother, and their ability to deal with their son's decision.  Transamerica is definitely one of 2005's best films, and more importantly, the viewer must recognize that it isn't meant to be ""provocative"" in the sense of the term.  It is first and foremost a very funny movie, and at times there are personal beliefs of the director poking in through the movie, but mostly, it's a warm-hearted and very sweet movie, and it isn't meant to be taken with sheer seriousness.

975594,A2D0I7M2G43WWP,B000EOTTV8,Mena P.,"[0, 0]","Let me start by saying I do love this movie and love having it in my collection. It always makes me laugh, and it's interesting to see people that I'm so familiar with in different genres (Huffman in ""Desperate Housewives"", Zegers in tons of made-for-tv movies, and Preston from ""True Blood"") do an independent movie like this. There are not enough movies out there that cover a broad enough range of LGBTQ protagonists (gay and lesbian sure, but what about gender fluid, pansexual, demisexual, etc?) so it was quite interesting to see a MTF transgender woman as the main character. But I do still feel like something is missing.Sabrina ""Bree"" Osbourne (formerly Stanley Schupak) is one signature away from her final surgery, and then she will be a complete woman, physically. She has completed her real life training and is ready for the full monty when she gets an unexpected call from someone claiming to be Stanley's son in need of bail money. It turns out that Bree's ex lover is dead, leaving behind their son, Toby. When Bree mentions the incident to her psychiatrist, she withholds the signature until Bree assesses this sudden turn in her life. When she does, she finds that her son is a drug addicted prostitute, and under the guise of a churchgoer on a cross country trip, plans to drop him off with his stepfather so she can move on and get her vaginoplasty. Things become much more complicated than she planned, though, and what she thinks is going to be an easy ride is full of twists and turns.A lot of LGBTQ reviewers seem to find this a sub-par addition to the media in our community due to portrayal, but I personally don't see anything wrong here. Out of all the characters, only Toby and his Johns are portrayed as something other than heterosexual (bisexual and homosexual, respectively). Aside from Bree, the only other transgender characters are a bunch of happy go lucky homebodies at a Mary Kay style party, who personally seem pretty normal and not over dramatized to me.Still, I feel like there are almost parts missing, and the ending, while sort of happy, always kind of leaves me wanting more. The acting though, definitely makes up for it. While most of the cast is accepting of Bree's gender secret, there is still the harsh reality of the hurt people sometimes feel when you keep the secret from them (Toby) and that sometimes even people you thought loved you will never truly accept you and sometimes even distance themselves from you (Bree's parents.) All in all, it's a fun, offbeat cross country road film about what family really means, and embracing your true self, past mistakes and all.",3,"A good movie, but missing something.",1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,2628,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'do', 'love', 'movie', 'love', 'having', 'collection', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'people', ""'m"", 'so', 'familiar', 'different', 'genres', 'Huffman', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Zegers', 'tons', 'made-for-tv', 'movies', 'Preston', 'True', 'Blood', 'do', 'independent', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'cover', 'broad', 'enough', 'range', 'LGBTQ', 'protagonists', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'sure', 'what', 'gender', 'fluid', 'pansexual', 'demisexual', 'etc', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'see', 'MTF', 'transgender', 'woman', 'main', 'character', 'do', 'still', 'feel', 'something', 'missing.Sabrina', 'Bree', 'Osbourne', 'formerly', 'Stanley', 'Schupak', 'one', 'signature', 'away', 'final', 'surgery', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'complete', 'woman', 'physically', 'completed', 'real', 'life', 'training', 'ready', 'full', 'monty', 'when', 'unexpected', 'call', 'someone', 'claiming', 'be', 'Stanley', 'son', 'need', 'bail', 'money', 'out', 'Bree', 'ex', 'lover', 'dead', 'leaving', 'son', 'Toby', 'When', 'Bree', 'incident', 'psychiatrist', 'signature', 'Bree', 'sudden', 'turn', 'life', 'When', 'son', 'drug', 'addicted', 'prostitute', 'guise', 'churchgoer', 'cross', 'country', 'trip', 'drop', 'off', 'stepfather', 'can', 'move', 'get', 'vaginoplasty', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'planned', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'ride', 'full', 'twists', 'turns.A', 'lot', 'LGBTQ', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'find', 'sub-par', 'addition', 'media', 'community', 'due', 'portrayal', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'here', 'characters', 'only', 'Toby', 'Johns', 'are', 'portrayed', 'something', 'other', 'heterosexual', 'bisexual', 'homosexual', 'respectively', 'Aside', 'Bree', 'only', 'other', 'transgender', 'characters', 'are', 'bunch', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'homebodies', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'style', 'party', 'who', 'personally', 'seem', 'pretty', 'normal', 'not', 'dramatized', 'me.Still', 'feel', 'are', 'almost', 'parts', 'missing', 'ending', 'sort', 'happy', 'always', 'kind', 'leaves', 'wanting', 'more', 'acting', 'definitely', 'up', 'most', 'cast', 'accepting', 'Bree', 'gender', 'secret', 'still', 'harsh', 'reality', 'hurt', 'people', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'when', 'keep', 'secret', 'Toby', 'sometimes', 'even', 'people', 'thought', 'loved', 'will', 'never', 'truly', 'sometimes', 'even', 'distance', 'Bree', 'parents', 'fun', 'offbeat', 'cross', 'country', 'road', 'film', 'what', 'family', 'really', 'embracing', 'true', 'self', 'past', 'mistakes']",N/A

Moore,"[10, 10]","I imagine that James Dobson has ground his teeth down to the gums about Duncan Tucker's ""Transamerica,"" and I only wish I'd been around to see it. Tucker deftly tests the limits of the idea of the non-traditional family as he tells the story of Bree, a pre-operative transsexual in L.A. who suddenly discovers that--in her previous life as Stanley--she fathered a son. She heads East to find that son, Toby, who is now a 17-year-old New York street hustler with ambitions of going West to become a gay porn actor. But just when you think John Waters and Divine are going to show up, Tucker turns the tables on us and transforms the story into a sweet, if somewhat skewed, road trip movie about how family members both harass and nurture each other. The trip is far from a joy ride: Toby has a major attitude problem (as well as a nascent drug problem), and Bree, obsessed with getting back to L.A. and her scheduled operation, tries to keep her true identity a secret. The ups and downs of their trip and its aftermath, however, keep the film funny, fresh, and above all moving. Felicity Huffman won a ton of awards and critical plaudits for her performance as Bree, and she deserved every one of them. The astonishingly handsome Kevin Zegers portrays Toby's confusion and anger with touching realism. There are also fine supporting performances from Elizabeth Pena, Burt Young, Carrie Preston, and especially from two of the all-time great character actors: Graham Greene, as a friendly Navajo rancher, and Fionnula Flanagan, as Bree's toxic smotherer of a mom. ""Transamerica"" contains a few missteps (I'd have to recount far too much of the plot to say what they were), but they are minor.

975598,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000EOTTV8,mirasreviews,"[5, 6]","""Transamerica"" is writer/director Duncan Tucker's feature film debut, a relationship film that takes the form of the road trip movies that the director most enjoys. Bree Osbourne (Felicity Huffman) is a transgendered woman one week away from her sexual reassignment surgery, the final step in her transformation to female anatomy, when she gets a phone call out of the blue from a young man looking for his father. Toby (Kevin Zegers) claims that his father is Bree's former self. Slightly shaken by the call, but determined not to do anything to jeopardize her upcoming surgery, Bree tells Toby that Stanley no longer lives there and hopes to forget the matter. But Bree's therapist Margaret (Elizabeth Pena) won't consent to the surgery until Bree deals with this ghost from the past. So Bree heads to New York to bail Toby out of jail and feel the situation out -which leads the odd couple to a cross-county road trip, Bree passing herself off as a missionary to juvenile delinquents and Toby trying her patience and evoking her sympathy with his troubled lifestyle.""Transamerica"" is a nice combination of family drama and road movie. Ostensibly, the goal is to reach California in time for Bree's surgery, with various dramas along the way. But this is Bree's quest for her identity. Bree hardly seems more comfortable in her female identity than she did as a man. Her growing relationship with Toby and their misadventures lead her to assert her identity more forcefully. I have to question director Duncan Tucker's interpretation of a transsexual woman. Bree is very unnatural: Bad hair, ill-applied make-up, a bizarre voice that sounds like a woman trying to sound like a man trying to sound like a woman while speaking through a toilet paper tube. This is not someone who has lived for years as a woman. Bree's appearance and mannerisms are freakish. That's not realistic. Even weekend cross-dressers aren't this unnatural. Why make Bree out to be an alien when you are trying to focus the audience's attention on her emotions? It's distracting at the very least. ""Transamerica"" is effective as a whole, but I can't imagine why Duncan Taylor chose to make Bree a freak show -albeit a sympathetic freak show.The DVD (Weinstein Company 2006): Bonus features include 3 featurettes, an audio commentary, a music video for Dolly Parton's theme song ""Travelin' Thru"", a blooper reel (4 min), and a theatrical trailer. ""A Conversation with Duncan Tucker and Felicity Huffman"" (19 min) is too long, but includes comments from Huffman on how she approached creating the character of Bree and from Tucker on filming, characters, actors, and the film's early reception. In ""A Conversation with Duncan Tucker and Kevin Zegers"" (10 min), Zegers  talks about his character, working with Huffman, and Tucker discusses directing. ""Making the Music Video"" (4 min) includes interviews with Duncan Tucker and Dolly Parton in which she talks about writing the film's theme song. Director Duncan Tucker covers a lot of territory in his audio commentary, which takes us through the film with discussion of photography, characters, story, production design, music, and themes.

The terrific actress plays Bree, a not-quite-yet woman waiting for the final sex-reassignment operation. However, a couple of days before the operation, Bree gets a phone call from NYPD, informing her she has a son and that she needs to get there and bail him out. Bree reluctantly does that, but instead of telling her hustler son she is his mother, she tells him she is a missionary and offers to drive him to California, where he wants to become a porn actor.This is a movie with real people and real problems. On the way to the East Coast, there are many twists and turns awaiting Bree and her son, and it adds to the humanity of these two, well, unique people. A very admirable aspect of this movie is that it never treats transsexuals as jokes - and Felicity Huffman always plays her character with respect. It is truly an Oscar-worthy performance. Another outstanding performance here is by Kevin Zegers, playing Bree's problematic son - and just you wait 'till you see the background story.

975607,A70YTUFJY5HXN,B000EOTTV8,Olukayode Balogun,"[3, 3]","So what's the story?Pre-op male to female transsexual Bree (Felicity Huffman) discovers she has a teenage son, Toby (Kevin Zegers). Unsurprisingly, some might say, Toby has gone off the rails slightly and has been arrested for prostitution - or hustling, to give it its proper street terminology. It's awful timing and Bree's therapist will not sign her off for the final stage of her transformation until she deals with the emotions of being a father. Bree has to go down and, pretending to be a church missionary type, bail Toby out and try to get him home. Thus begins a road trip across America with a difference.An issue-led drama then.Well, not exactly. By getting a woman to play a man wanting to become a woman, I think Hollywood compromised in order to make the movie more palatable to the mainstream. It would've been much easier, more courageous and closer to the truth of the story, to get a man to play the role. This was a golden opportunity to grasp the sensitive and overlooked issue of gender dysphoria or transsexualism and give it the prominence it deserves. I'm not sure that was achieved here.Would any major Hollywood star have signed up for it?Good point. Hollywood does have a history of guys dressing up was gals for laughs - Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in ""Some Like It Hot"", Dustin Hoffman in ""Tootsie"" and Robin Williams in ""Mrs Doubtfire"" are a few examples, but being a male to female transgender person is not the same as being a transvestite, drag queen or fetishistic cross dresser. Hence, while it may have been easy to get stars like Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguziamo to drag up in ""Too Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar"", getting a male movie star to play this role could have potentially presented a significant challenge but I think it would've been a challenge worth facing.So a disappointment then?Quite the opposite. Felicity Huffman is a tour de force in the role. She is funny, engaging and, with the aid of clever prosthetics, totally convincing - a million miles away from Lynette, the sleek, sophisticated professional she plays on ""Desperate Housewives"". She obviously did her research and seems to have a very clear grasp of the emotional gravitas of what it means to be born into one gender, while believing and desperately wishing and wanting to be another. I hadn't actually seen either this nor ""Walk The Line"" when Reese Witherspoon won best actress Oscar for the latter film earlier this year. But I'd seen the trailers, and she did learn to sing for goodness sake, so I thought it was an Oscar well deserved. Now, having seen both movies, I'm not so sure. Actually, the more I think about it, the more I think Huffman may have been robbed. At its heart, this movie is all about two people rediscovering themselves, while discovering each other. The story of the father and son getting to know each other (despite emotional obstacles that both of them are grappling with) is very touching and there is humour and pathos here in equal measure. I personally laughed my head off almost all the way through. The relationship starts off hostile, moves on to awkward but by the end of the movie, you really get the sense that these are two individuals who may actually go the distance. How will Toby react when he finds out that this silly looking woman is actually the father he's hit the road to find? How will Middle America react to Bree as they cruise through small towns, motels and truck stops on the road from east to west? Will anyone actually suss that Bree's a man? All these questions make it an exciting movie to watch and I think it's a triumph, not just for Huffman herself but also for newcomer Duncan Tucker who both wrote and directed the movie, as well as William H Macy (Huffman's husband), who produced it. They should all be very proud.And before I forget: a special nod to Elizabeth Pena who plays Bree's therapist.

Although she did not get the Oscar, Felicity Huffman's acting deserved it, hands down. (June Carter Cash has sentimental appeal.) I watched the movie forgetting the lead was played by Felicity, and I was convinced Bree Osbourne was a male actor. I could almost recognize him, and I was racking my mind trying to figure it out. Because Bree is biologically male, it seems obvious the role should be male. However, Bree is convinced she is a woman. The movie supports that idea, and a woman should be played by a woman. Felicity's performance is totally convincing. Even knowing it is Felicity, I cannot reconcile the contrast; I do not see Felicity Huffman in Bree Osbourne at all.Bree Osbourne convincingly played by a woman is what makes this movie great (5*). Otherwise its just a warm & fuzzy human interest story (4*) with perverse twists that might make me, a viewer, wonder if I'm perverse to be watching it. Well, this movie is not a peep show; come as yourself.Casting (Eve Battaglia), costumes (Danny Glicker), music (David Mansfield), and supporting actors are all in-tune.

It is awesome the powerful & positive effect Bree Osbourne the woman has on others, vs. the ineffective, inept social interactions of Bree the man.

Reese was adorable as June Carter, but Felicity Huffman's transformation in this film is astounding--the way she carries herself, the way she speaks, the subtle ways in which Bree becomes more and more comfortable in her body as the film progresses...it was a revelatory performance. There was not one moment where I didn't fully believe that she was a woman who used to look like a man learning how to be a woman in her new body. And she makes Bree so relatable, which is an enormous accomplishment considering transsexuality is a topic that makes so many people uncomfortable.I'm not even going to get into complaining that this should have been nominated (and won) for Best Picture as well, because, really, what's the point? But suffice it to say, it was brilliant, and also restrained. Although I am a fan of indie films, many of them do tend to have a pretentious streak, and this one did not. It was heartfelt, honest, funny, painful at times, and also short. Too short, in fact. I wanted to stay with these characters much longer. Btw, Kevin Zegers, who played her newfound son, gave a fantastic performance as well. It takes a great deal of talent to be paired with an actress of Felicity Huffman's skill and to not come across as inferior by comparison. He deserves just as much acclaim as she received.

There are few story concepts as seemingly traditional as the cross-country journey - an opportunity to feature a lot of the diversity of the various states and what each has to offer. And to marry this with the transsexual story of self-discovery was an interesting way to stress how such LGBT stories are part of American culture whether people realize it or not.Now admittedly I had somewhat mixed feelings about the need for a female actress to portray the role of a pre-op transsexual. But at the same time, I recognize the power that any big name actress can bring to a movie plus the fact that Felicty Huffman did a tremendous job in her performance. Together with the make-up team that helped supplement her features to make them more masculine and we had a woman who actually did a great job portraying a man wanting to become a woman.Kevin Zegers was also a rather impressive find and I can see why he had received a few nominations and awards of his own. More than just  being a disgruntled teenager rebelling against his lot in life, the role of Toby was given a lot of complexity and that demanded quite a lot out of the young actor.

975615,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000EOTTV8,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","Felicity Huffman earned richly deserved critical acclaim and many Best Actress awards and nominations for her transcendent performance as a man on the verge of a sex change operation in Duncan Hunter`s ""Transamerica,"" a thoroughly offbeat and utterly winning tribute to both the diversity and the sameness that paradoxically lie at the heart of the human condition.""Bree"" (aka Stanley Osbourne in a soon-to-be former life) is just a few weeks away from officially becoming the woman she's believed all her life she was meant to be, when she discovers, much to her horror, that she may be the father of a 17-year old son she never knew she had.  At first, Bree is reluctant to complicate her life right on the eve of her tremendous transformation and hopes to deal with the boy - if at all - after she has undergone the surgery.  However, her transitional therapist insists that Bree confront the issue immediately so that she will not be going into her new life carrying over any unresolved baggage from her old one.  Thus, Bree heads off to New York City where Toby, her son, is residing in jail on charges of drug possession and prostitution.  Bree doesn't inform Toby of their filial connection, passing herself off as a concerned church lady whose job it is to help rescue youngsters in trouble.  Thus, they set off on a bizarre transcontinental road trip from New York City to the great Southwest, encountering many life-altering experiences and revelations along the way.In many ways, for all its uniqueness of subject matter, ""Transamerica"" follows the standard blueprint of the classic ""road picture,"" starting at Point A and ending at Point B, with the characters learning a great deal about life and one another on the way to their destination.  As their relationship evolves, so do they as individuals.  Yet, even though we know where all this is probably going to end up, the film doesn't feel stale or forced, partly due to the depth of the characterizations and partly due to the brilliant performances of Huffman and young Kevin Zegers as Toby.  Huffman could easily have relied on mere mimicry to guide her interpretation of a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman.  Yet, even though she has all the physical nuances and mannerisms of that situation down pat, Huffman goes far deeper in her portrayal, plumbing the soul of an individual who's been hurt by life but whose resilience and sense of decency keep her intensely focused on where she's going in her life.  This is, obviously, a very challenging role for the actress, for in addition to having to remain ""in character"" in terms of voice control and movement, Huffman, to make the character truly three-dimensional, has had to flesh Bree out with the subtlest of facial expressions and inflections.  Zegers provides a perfect counterpart to Huffman's often studied rigidity (she naturally fears that she will be ""read"" at every given moment and this leads to her seeming uptightness), playing a troubled young man with very few boundaries in his life but whose innate sweetness and capacity for love is still buried somewhere beneath his hardened exterior.  The two of them grow in understanding of one another as they forge an unconventional but potentially satisfying life together.There are other outstanding performances by Elizabeth Pena, Carrie Preston, and Fionnula Flanagan, brilliant as Bree's harsh and highly judgmental mother who has never been able to accept the truth about her one male child.  The screenplay by Hunter is rich with insight and humor, and his breezy direction makes the rural setting - with its shabby diners and sleazy motel rooms and vast stretches of empty roadway - an integral part of the film.In a way, it is a stroke of genius on the part of  Hunter to set his film in the heartland of Middle America rather than in a big city where transsexuals would likely find much greater acceptance by the populace as a whole.  It is Hunter's way of telling people that, even in ""Red State"" communities, people like Bree exist and need to be accepted for who they are.  Perhaps this film, so full of warmth, good humor, and feeling, will function as a small but significant step in that direction.",4,two superb performances in a heartwarming film,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,4213,"['Felicity', 'Huffman', 'earned', 'richly', 'deserved', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'many', 'Best', 'Actress', 'awards', 'nominations', 'transcendent', 'performance', 'man', 'verge', 'sex', 'change', 'operation', 'Duncan', 'Hunter', 's', 'Transamerica', 'thoroughly', 'offbeat', 'utterly', 'winning', 'tribute', 'diversity', 'sameness', 'paradoxically', 'heart', 'human', 'condition', 'Bree', 'aka', 'Stanley', 'Osbourne', 'soon-to-be', 'former', 'life', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'away', 'officially', 'becoming', 'woman', 'believed', 'life', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'when', 'much', 'horror', 'may', 'be', 'father', '17-year', 'old', 'son', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'first', 'Bree', 'reluctant', 'complicate', 'life', 'right', 'eve', 'tremendous', 'transformation', 'deal', 'boy', 'undergone', 'surgery', 'However', 'transitional', 'therapist', 'insists', 'Bree', 'issue', 'immediately', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'going', 'new', 'life', 'carrying', 'unresolved', 'baggage', 'old', 'one', 'Thus', 'Bree', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'Toby', 'son', 'residing', 'jail', 'charges', 'drug', 'possession', 'prostitution', 'Bree', ""n't"", 'inform', 'Toby', 'filial', 'connection', 'passing', 'off', 'concerned', 'church', 'lady', 'job', 'help', 'rescue', 'youngsters', 'trouble', 'Thus', 'set', 'off', 'bizarre', 'transcontinental', 'road', 'trip', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'great', 'Southwest', 'encountering', 'many', 'life-altering', 'experiences', 'revelations', 'way.In', 'many', 'ways', 'uniqueness', 'subject', 'matter', 'Transamerica', 'standard', 'blueprint', 'classic', 'road', 'picture', 'starting', 'Point', 'A', 'ending', 'Point', 'B', 'characters', 'learning', 'great', 'deal', 'life', 'one', 'way', 'destination', 'relationship', 'evolves', 'so', 'do', 'individuals', 'even', 'know', 'where', 'probably', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'stale', 'forced', 'partly', 'due', 'depth', 'characterizations', 'partly', 'due', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Huffman', 'young', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'Toby', 'Huffman', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'relied', 'mere', 'mimicry', 'guide', 'interpretation', 'woman', 'pretending', 'be', 'man', 'pretending', 'be', 'woman', 'even', 'physical', 'nuances', 'mannerisms', 'situation', 'down', 'pat', 'Huffman', 'far', 'deeper', 'portrayal', 'plumbing', 'soul', 'individual', 'who', 'been', 'hurt', 'life', 'resilience', 'sense', 'decency', 'keep', 'intensely', 'focused', 'where', 'going', 'life', 'obviously', 'very', 'challenging', 'role', 'actress', 'addition', 'having', 'remain', 'character', 'terms', 'voice', 'control', 'movement', 'Huffman', 'make', 'character', 'truly', 'three-dimensional', 'had', 'flesh', 'Bree', 'subtlest', 'facial', 'expressions', 'inflections', 'Zegers', 'perfect', 'counterpart', 'Huffman', 'often', 'studied', 'rigidity', 'naturally', 'will', 'be', 'read', 'given', 'moment', 'seeming', 'uptightness', 'playing', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'very', 'few', 'boundaries', 'life', 'innate', 'sweetness', 'capacity', 'love', 'still', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'beneath', 'hardened', 'exterior', 'two', 'grow', 'understanding', 'one', 'forge', 'unconventional', 'potentially', 'satisfying', 'life', 'are', 'other', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'Carrie', 'Preston', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'brilliant', 'Bree', 'harsh', 'highly', 'judgmental', 'mother', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'accept', 'truth', 'one', 'male', 'child', 'screenplay', 'Hunter', 'rich', 'insight', 'humor', 'breezy', 'direction', 'rural', 'setting', 'shabby', 'diners', 'sleazy', 'motel', 'rooms', 'vast', 'stretches', 'empty', 'roadway', 'integral', 'part', 'film.In', 'way', 'stroke', 'genius', 'part', 'Hunter', 'set', 'film', 'heartland', 'Middle', 'America', 'rather', 'big', 'city', 'where', 'transsexuals', 'would', 'likely', 'find', 'much', 'greater', 'acceptance', 'populace', 'whole', 'Hunter', 'way', 'telling', 'people', 'even', 'Red', 'State', 'communities', 'people', 'Bree', 'exist', 'need', 'be', 'accepted', 'who', 'are', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'full', 'warmth', 'good', 'humor', 'feeling', 'will', 'function', 'small', 'significant', 'step', 'direction']",N/A

Just when Bree thinks she is set to have her M-to-F surgery, she discovers she has a teenaged son she knew nothing of, the greater snag being that he's gotten himself in trouble and needs bailing out immediately.  At the risk of interfering with her surgery date she travels cross country to deal with her son, only to find that he has no one, is deeply troubled and has some dangerously skewed perspectives on his self-worth and life.  While the pitfalls of her adventure are somewhat predictable, the crux of the story deals with Bree making decisions around putting herself first after a lifetime of catering to the expectations of the world around her, reaching out to someone who isn't sure he wants help, and having to bear the cruelty and prejudice of her own parents to accomplish all of the above.The widespread cultural assumptions of third gender people being oversexed and heretically life path inclined are dealt with head-on in TransAmerica.  In contradiction to the popular myths, Duncan, the film's writer, puts an incredibly personal spin on Bree, creating her as the insecure and eternally hopeful soul one might realistically imagine many who feel biologically displaced to be.  Felicity Huffman's stellar performance as the very subdued Bree only gives more credence to her quiet need to create balance in her life the one way that feels completely right to her.  The hallmark of this film is that regardless what branch of the gender tree you grow on, we all go through much of the same life experiences. We all have to make selfish and selfless choices around dealing with someone who is destitute.  We all have to decide how much influence our parents have over our life choices.  We all have to decide whom we allow to see our deepest fears and ambitions, forsaking the rest that would threaten them.

The most heartfealt scenes are the ones in which Bree visits with her family, and the confrontations she has with her mother who doesn't approve of what ""Stanley"" has done with his life.Felicity Huffman should have won the Oscar that year as she gave one of the best performances ever by an actress in the cinema. When you watch ""Transamerica"" you forget all about Felicity's role in TV's ""Desperate Housewives"". Everything from Huffman's voice to her mannerisms are impeccable, and you think you are actually watching a man transforming into a woman on the screen. Kevin Zeegers is also great as the son who is a prostitute and ends up working in the porn industry on his jont to California.The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, including one for Huffman for Best Actress, and the other for Dolly Parton (who wrote the title theme) for Best original Song for ""Travellin' Thru"".The DVD comes with the trailer, Dolly's video for ""Travellin' Thru"", behind-the-scenes featurette, commentary by director Duncan Tucker, blooper reel, and interviews with the cast.",5,"""One of The Best Original Independent Films""",1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,1518,"['Transamerica', 'story', 'Bree', 'formerly', 'Stanley', 'who', 'pre-operative', 'male-to-female', 'transexual', 'who', 'had', 'son', 'fathered', '17', 'years', 'before', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'New', 'York', 'son', 'down', 'travels', 'cross-country', 'back', 'California', 'where', 'surgery', 'date', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'buddy', 'films', 'genre', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'son', 'encounter', 'many', 'characters', 'way', 'most', 'heartfealt', 'scenes', 'are', 'ones', 'Bree', 'visits', 'family', 'confrontations', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'approve', 'what', 'Stanley', 'done', 'life.Felicity', 'Huffman', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'actress', 'cinema', 'When', 'watch', 'Transamerica', 'forget', 'Felicity', 'role', 'TV', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Everything', 'Huffman', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'impeccable', 'think', 'are', 'actually', 'watching', 'man', 'transforming', 'woman', 'screen', 'Kevin', 'Zeegers', 'also', 'great', 'son', 'who', 'prostitute', 'up', 'working', 'porn', 'industry', 'jont', 'California.The', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'one', 'Huffman', 'Best', 'Actress', 'other', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'who', 'wrote', 'title', 'theme', 'Best', 'original', 'Song', 'Travellin', 'Thru', '.The', 'DVD', 'trailer', 'Dolly', 'video', 'Travellin', 'Thru', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'commentary', 'director', 'Duncan', 'Tucker', 'blooper', 'reel', 'interviews', 'cast']",N/A

975628,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000EOTTV8,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 3]","From the moment we first see Bree Osborne (Felicity Huffman, TV's ""Desperate Housewives""), a pre-op Transgender patient, it is difficult to recognize the well-known actress. Occasionally, an actor will so completely take on the role they are playing it becomes difficult to spot them, to remember we are not watching an actor play a role. Often when this happens, the actor has gone on to win an Academy Award. Huffman does this with Bree Osborne in ""Transamerica"". If she doesn't win the Oscar, she will be robbed.Bree has slowly and deliberately completed all of the necessary requirements to receive the surgery she so desperately wants. The surgery which will finally remove all traces of her former self, of Stanley, and help her finally live the life she has always dreamed of. Her psychiatrist (Elizabeth Pena) has guided her through the process, helping her, preparing her, making sure she is ready for the final step. And both are very happy when Bree has reached the final step. But then she receives a call from New York informing her that Stanley's son is in jail. She talks to her psychiatrist about this and learns she must travel to New York and help the son she never knew she had, her former self had, before she can have the surgery. Heartbroken, she realizes this is just the latest hurdle on the long journey. Upon her arrival in New York, she bails Toby (Kevin Zegers) out and realizes he is living in squalor, as a prostitute. She poses as a missionary from a church and agrees to give him a ride to Los Angeles. Along the way, they learn a lot about each other, making them stronger, better people.""Transamerica"" is a good film featuring a great performance by Huffman. The film's roots and production values are very evident, giving the finished product a grainy, low-budget look, ultimately detracting from the film. But only slightly.Felicity Huffman's transformation is amazing. Much like Dustin Hoffman in ""Tootsie"", the two actors successfully become their characters in both appearance and manner. Huffman does a better job, simply because she is more successful in satisfying both the appearance and mannerisms of her character. In ""Tootsie"", we bought into Hoffman's portrayal of Dorothy Michaels, because it was funny and it fit. No one in their right mind would ever believe she is a real woman. But because the acting was so good, and the film was so funny, we went along for the ride. In ""Transamerica"", Huffman looks remarkably similar to Hoffman in the comedy, but the key difference is that Bree is a pre-op transsexual and the film is more dramatic. She isn't a woman. Yet. We can believe her very mannish appearance because of the stage of her transformation.Huffman does a remarkable job of becoming a very masculine looking woman, a masculine looking woman who wants to appear feminine. Huffman is a great actress and very good looking, but she isn't a beauty, in the traditional Hollywood sense. If she were, the role would have been difficult to pull off. The role embraces Huffman's unique looks, allowing her to become all the more convincing as she plays the role.Huffman also captures the right amount of exaggerated femininity for the role. As Bree is trying to become a woman, many aspects of her character are learned through observation and practice. Every piece of clothing Bree wears is very feminine, too feminine, and tightly coordinated with every other piece. The result? She looks like a Mary Kay Salesman, wearing pink skirts and matching coats with bright scarves around her neck. As Bree is, essentially, playing a part, she occasionally slips and ""let's down her guard"". The few times this happens, we see further skill of Huffman's ability and realize Bree has been working on the process for a long time. Her mannerisms are just right, making her appear like a man trying to be a woman, always moving her hands, trying to be delicate, demure and very feminine. Because Bree tries so hard, she gives herself away but we get a sense that her surgery will make everything right again, when she can acclimate, everything will fall into place.If the performance were simply about becoming the character, it would be good, but because Bree lives a believable life, the performance becomes great. During the first act, we witness Bree's life and learn of how she has adapted her life. Living in a small cottage in a largely Latino neighborhood, she waits for the bus with other workers. Standing next to a man, Bree realizes she is too tall and bends her knees a little, until she is lower than him. We watch Bree at her job as a bus boy, with her psychiatrist, in her neighborhood. But something we don't really realize, until later in the film, is how isolated her life is. No significant other, no friends, no family. This is part of the reason her psychiatrist postpones her surgery until she deals with the discovery of her son. The psychiatrist won't let her blow off his problems, or postpone meeting him until after the surgery. It is painful for Bree, but she does it, always hoping to successfully navigate the new hurdle in time for her to keep her scheduled surgery.Upon her arrival in New York, she meets Toby (Zegers), and bails him out. When she sees his living conditions, that he is living in squalor, and working as a prostitute, she can't simply leave him there. She has to help. Initially, she decides to reunite him with his step-dad, something he doesn't seem very eager for.Kevin Zegers is very good. Toby is a fairly typical character; into drugs, aimless, trying to survive, he sells his body for money. At first, the character doesn't seem like it will offer anything new, and for a long time, this appears to be the case. But then we realize he is just as isolated as Bree. Throughout the film, we watch him form a friendship, a bond, with his new found friend.""Transamerica"" ultimately becomes a road picture and this is not my favorite type of film. Road pictures just seem like easy, manipulative ways to get two or three characters to learn about each other, for the benefit of the audience. But in the case of ""Transamerica"", the two characters are so believable, and so interesting, that I was willing to overlook the inevitable scene in which they have to campout, or visit a back roads diner, or a small gas station. The road trip aspect of the film is very predictable and also very low-budget. The filmmakers obviously don't have to pay a lot to film in the wilderness, at a low-budget motel, or on the back roads of Kentucky.From the road picture scenario to the grainy look of the film, ""Transamerica"" is a low-budget film. And it works. But why can't a major studio spend some money on a project like this? Perhaps with the success of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and the positive reviews for Huffman in this film, studios will be more willing to make films exploring challenging themes like these. Not every film about gay people or people with challenging needs has to look like it was made with a couple of hand held cameras and a bootleg copy of AVID on someone's home computer.I was also impressed with the resolution of ""Transamerica"". The film ends on a realistic note, the characters are happy with some of their accomplishments and unhappy with other aspects of their lives. They don't ride off into the sunset, happy as clams. Given the backgrounds of the characters, their problems, their secrets, their previous lives, this seems entirely realistic. If the characters resolved everything well and lived happily ever after, the film would end on a false note, changing our view of the project. We get the sense that Bree and her son will have to get to know each other some more, after we have gone home, in private.",4,A Great Performance by Huffman,1139184000,"02 6,

However, Bree learns that she has a 17-year-old son Toby whom she has not even known the presence of until then, and that he is now in jail. Bree decides to travel to NYC where she learns what Toby had been doing on the street. Without telling him the truth about her identity, Bree offers a ride back to LA for Toby, who wants to be in a porno film.The topic of gender identity or transsexual is not new - see `Boys Don't Cry' - but if Bree and the film `Transamerica' are raising voices against discrimination, they do it more quietly. Bree only wants to be nice to the boy, and help him mend his ways, and as many well-intentioned parents do, Bree sometimes overreaches herself. The film's theme is more universal than its subject matter might lead you to expect.Slightly downbeat `Transamerica' offers a few laughs along the way, but it basically belongs to the road movie genre that has been seen in the past films many times. On the way to their destination, Bree and Toby meet people, come to understand each other, and themselves too, sadder and wiser than before. The format is surely predictable, including such familiar items as young hitchhiker, crowded bar, truck driver, and reunion with family, but it works because of Felicity Huffman's excellent portrait of Bree, and the authentic acting from Kevin Zegers as a troubled teenager.Capable supporting actors such as Fionnula Flanagan, Burt Young, Graham Greene, and Elizabeth Pena appear, but the segment of Fionnula Flanagan and Burt Young playing Bree's parents look a little out of place after watching the film's slower first half depicting the quiet and clever exchange of words between Bree and Toby. Fionnula Flanagan's over-the-top acting as Bree's controlling mother might impress you (like a character you can see in a sit-com), but not in the same way as the off-beat rhythm of earnestness in Felicity Huffman's character, which makes her more human and likable without patronizing.I say this because `Transamerica' offers a curiously pleasant experience of watching a unique subject matter treated with orthodox approach. The film deals with sexuality, but it is not exactly about sexuality itself. The film succeeds because it refuses to be shocking or campy. It is not only about Bree and Toby; it is about you and me.",4,Transamerica: Road Trip to Find Your Self,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,2441,"['Sabrina', 'Bree', 'working', 'waitress', 'Mexican', 'restraint', 'LA', 'going', 'have', 'male-to-female', 'transsexual', 'operation', 'week', 'However', 'Bree', '17-year-old', 'son', 'Toby', 'whom', 'not', 'even', 'known', 'presence', 'then', 'now', 'jail', 'Bree', 'travel', 'NYC', 'where', 'what', 'Toby', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'street', 'telling', 'truth', 'identity', 'Bree', 'ride', 'back', 'LA', 'Toby', 'who', 'be', 'porno', 'film.The', 'topic', 'gender', 'identity', 'transsexual', 'not', 'new', 'see', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Bree', 'film', 'Transamerica', 'are', 'raising', 'voices', 'discrimination', 'do', 'more', 'quietly', 'Bree', 'only', 'be', 'nice', 'boy', 'help', 'mend', 'ways', 'many', 'well-intentioned', 'parents', 'do', 'Bree', 'sometimes', 'film', 'theme', 'more', 'universal', 'subject', 'matter', 'might', 'lead', 'expect.Slightly', 'downbeat', 'Transamerica', 'few', 'laughs', 'way', 'basically', 'road', 'movie', 'genre', 'been', 'seen', 'past', 'films', 'many', 'times', 'way', 'destination', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'meet', 'people', 'come', 'understand', 'other', 'too', 'sadder', 'wiser', 'before', 'format', 'surely', 'predictable', 'including', 'such', 'familiar', 'items', 'young', 'hitchhiker', 'crowded', 'bar', 'truck', 'driver', 'reunion', 'family', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'excellent', 'portrait', 'Bree', 'authentic', 'acting', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'troubled', 'teenager.Capable', 'supporting', 'actors', 'such', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'appear', 'segment', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Burt', 'Young', 'playing', 'Bree', 'parents', 'look', 'little', 'place', 'watching', 'film', 'slower', 'first', 'half', 'depicting', 'quiet', 'clever', 'exchange', 'words', 'Bree', 'Toby', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'Bree', 'controlling', 'mother', 'might', 'impress', 'character', 'can', 'see', 'sit-com', 'not', 'same', 'way', 'off-beat', 'rhythm', 'earnestness', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'character', 'more', 'human', 'likable', 'patronizing.I', 'say', 'Transamerica', 'curiously', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'watching', 'unique', 'subject', 'matter', 'treated', 'orthodox', 'approach', 'film', 'deals', 'sexuality', 'not', 'exactly', 'sexuality', 'film', 'be', 'shocking', 'campy', 'not', 'only', 'Bree', 'Toby']",N/A

The only twist is that it deals with a transgender human being trying to bond with his son before his surgery (coincidently, getting a phone call from him 5 days before it). Felicity Huffman did a decent and convincing job at playing Bree. It wasn't anything brilliant, however; I thought that she lacked emotion and depth, while the actor playing as Bree's son, was a bit lackluster and just confusing. Transamerica has a few amusing episodes, but i found many aspects of it very unrealistic *SPOILER ALERT!*.For instance, when did Bree's son all of a sudden start to fall in love with her? How could he openly reveal Bree's gender in public, humilating her and calling her a liar and freak, and then out of nowhere proclaim that he thinks that she's sexy and would marry her if he could? That was totally out of character. And many times throughout the movie, I felt that some events happened and ended so quickly (the girl in the restaurant suddenly kissing Bree's son, both of them being in the woods one night, then being in the middle of nowhere, then suddenly being in a restaurant, then at a house full of transgender people) that it seemed like a quick and easy way to get the plot moving. And although this film touched upon serious issues (drug abuse, suicide, and male prostitution), it felt a bit typical, if not predictable, that these things did happen to this family. Mainly, though, the downfall of Transamerica is that it could have been much deeper and emotional, possibly being more in depth about the life of a transgender person. The relationship between Bree and her son felt forced and stubborn to the end.

She bails him out of jail but keeps secret who she is. Lots of unusual situations come during their ride to California.This is a fantastic movie! I like how people were people instead of stereotypes.

975636,ALSKUJF2WZ44L,B000EOTTV8,Windwolfess,"[1, 1]","I very much enjoyed this movie, and am hoping that there is a sequel in which Bree returns to New Mexico and lives happily ever after!I guess the reason that I enjoyed this movie so much were my own difficulties in learning how to acknowledge the past while embracing who I am.  All transgendered men and women must confront what part of the past to bury or deny, and what part to carry forward into the new existence.  So many of us would rather supress all that comes before the transition, and try to start fresh.  It is like starting a new job in a new city; we think that we can bury all of the bad things that we did or are, and somehow begin anew.  But we can't, and that is what Bree's therapist tries to teach her.  The movie is about Bree's journey (the metaphor of the road trip), from the ""stealth"" life based on denial, to the healthier life, birthed through much pain in confronting herself, her parents, her son.  The movie is non-judgemental in terms of gender identity, but very much on the side of personal honesty.I particularly enjoyed the ending in which Bree's son has not become a saint, but rather someone who few would approve, and yet their love and bond is strengthened.The acting was great, but I was left wondering why they couldn't have had a genetic male play the role of Bree.  It almost offended me as I would think that a white man in black face playing a black man would have offended a true black man 70 years ago. Don't misunderstand me; Huffman did a great job, but somehow, I would have preferred a real transsexual or at least a man (think Steven Macintosh in ""Different for Girls"") to have played the role.Paula",4,A Journey Similar and Yet Different from my Own,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,1652,"['very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'am', 'hoping', 'sequel', 'Bree', 'returns', 'New', 'Mexico', 'happily', 'ever', 'guess', 'reason', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'were', 'own', 'difficulties', 'learning', 'how', 'acknowledge', 'past', 'embracing', 'who', 'am', 'transgendered', 'men', 'women', 'must', 'confront', 'what', 'part', 'past', 'bury', 'deny', 'what', 'part', 'carry', 'forward', 'new', 'existence', 'So', 'many', 'would', 'rather', 'supress', 'transition', 'try', 'start', 'fresh', 'starting', 'new', 'job', 'new', 'city', 'think', 'can', 'bury', 'bad', 'things', 'did', 'are', 'somehow', 'begin', 'anew', 'ca', ""n't"", 'what', 'Bree', 'therapist', 'tries', 'teach', 'movie', 'Bree', 'journey', 'metaphor', 'road', 'trip', 'stealth', 'life', 'based', 'denial', 'healthier', 'life', 'birthed', 'much', 'pain', 'confronting', 'parents', 'son', 'movie', 'non-judgemental', 'terms', 'gender', 'identity', 'very', 'much', 'side', 'personal', 'honesty.I', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'Bree', 'son', 'not', 'become', 'saint', 'rather', 'someone', 'who', 'few', 'would', 'approve', 'yet', 'love', 'bond', 'strengthened.The', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'genetic', 'male', 'play', 'role', 'Bree', 'almost', 'offended', 'would', 'think', 'white', 'man', 'black', 'face', 'playing', 'black', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'offended', 'true', 'black', 'man', '70', 'years', 'ago', 'Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'Huffman', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'somehow', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'real', 'transsexual', 'least', 'man', 'think', 'Steven', 'Macintosh', 'Different', 'Girls', 'have', 'played', 'role.Paula']",N/A
975637,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000EOTTV8,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[5, 5]","Prior to seeing Transamerica, I have not seen any of Felicity Huffman's work, not even the Desperate Housewives, and I must say that her performance in this film is by far the best and most challenging by an actress this year. I can say that her transformation is very convincing and subtle, because I have known numerous drag queens, transvesites, preoperative transsexuals. I am very impressed by her makeup, voice, and mannerism. She's obviously done a lot of work and research preparing for the role of Bree/Stanley. This is a really great roadtrip movie filled with plenty of funny and touching moments. I was amazed to see that most of the audiences were women and straight couples.Huffman plays a Bree, a preoperative transgender person on the verge going through her sexual reassignment operation. Just one week before she completely becomes a woman physically, she's informed that she has a 17 year old son who was arrestted for drug use, and she must go and bail him out. Kevin Zegers plays the rebellious Toby who is a ranaway and works as a street hustler. Upon meeting Bree, he unsuspectingly believes that she's actually from the Christian missionary. The father/mother and son then embark on a roadtrip across America to Los Angeles. Along the way, they came across a hitchhiker who later stole their car, and then got helped by a Native Indian who had a crush on Bree. Bree also stopped at Kentuckey to allow Toby to visit his step father and foster family, but things got rather ugly when Toby confronted his stepfather who used to abuse and molested him, and that his mother also committed suicide years ago.Later on, Bree pays an unannouced visit to her estranged parents house in Phoenix. Bree's parents were surprised and shocked by the new appearance of their son. At one point, her mother(Fionnula Flanagan) said,""I love you, but I don't respect you..."", and she was so happy and relieved to learn that Toby was her grandson. But Bree has yet to disclose her true identity to Toby before going back to L.A. for the surgery....Kevin Zegers has come a long way since his Airbud movies, and he's probably going to become the biggest Canadian actor to rise to the top in Hollywood. He held his own opposite brilliant actors like Fionnula Flanagan and Huffman. He's willing to do nudity and gay love scenes in this film. Flanagan gave a scene-stealing performance, but she's somewhat underexposed. Elizabeth Pena is also wonderful as Bree's compassionate best friend/therapist. I had lauged so many times throughout this film, and the post surgery scene just moved me to massive tears. Ultimately, I think this generated the best performance from Filicity Huffman, and I have a feeling that she will take home the gold along with Phillip Seymour Hoffman at the Oscar this year.",5,Felicity Huffman Gives the Performance of a Lifetime!,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,2795,"['Prior', 'seeing', 'Transamerica', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'work', 'not', 'even', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'must', 'say', 'performance', 'film', 'far', 'best', 'most', 'challenging', 'actress', 'year', 'can', 'say', 'transformation', 'very', 'convincing', 'subtle', 'have', 'known', 'numerous', 'drag', 'queens', 'transvesites', 'preoperative', 'transsexuals', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'makeup', 'voice', 'mannerism', 'obviously', 'done', 'lot', 'work', 'research', 'preparing', 'role', 'Bree/Stanley', 'really', 'great', 'roadtrip', 'movie', 'filled', 'plenty', 'funny', 'touching', 'moments', 'was', 'amazed', 'see', 'most', 'audiences', 'were', 'women', 'straight', 'couples.Huffman', 'Bree', 'preoperative', 'transgender', 'person', 'verge', 'going', 'sexual', 'reassignment', 'operation', 'Just', 'one', 'week', 'completely', 'woman', 'physically', 'informed', '17', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'arrestted', 'drug', 'use', 'must', 'go', 'bail', 'out', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'rebellious', 'Toby', 'who', 'ranaway', 'street', 'hustler', 'meeting', 'Bree', 'unsuspectingly', 'actually', 'Christian', 'missionary', 'father/mother', 'son', 'then', 'roadtrip', 'America', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'way', 'came', 'hitchhiker', 'who', 'later', 'stole', 'car', 'then', 'got', 'helped', 'Native', 'Indian', 'who', 'had', 'crush', 'Bree', 'Bree', 'also', 'stopped', 'Kentuckey', 'allow', 'Toby', 'visit', 'step', 'father', 'foster', 'family', 'things', 'got', 'rather', 'ugly', 'when', 'Toby', 'confronted', 'stepfather', 'who', 'used', 'abuse', 'molested', 'mother', 'also', 'committed', 'suicide', 'years', 'ago.Later', 'Bree', 'unannouced', 'visit', 'estranged', 'parents', 'house', 'Phoenix', 'Bree', 'parents', 'were', 'surprised', 'shocked', 'new', 'appearance', 'son', 'one', 'point', 'mother', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'said', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'respect', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'relieved', 'learn', 'Toby', 'was', 'grandson', 'Bree', 'yet', 'disclose', 'true', 'identity', 'Toby', 'going', 'back', 'L.A.', 'surgery', '.Kevin', 'Zegers', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Airbud', 'movies', 'probably', 'going', 'become', 'biggest', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'rise', 'top', 'Hollywood', 'held', 'own', 'opposite', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Huffman', 'willing', 'do', 'nudity', 'gay', 'love', 'scenes', 'film', 'Flanagan', 'gave', 'scene-stealing', 'performance', 'somewhat', 'underexposed', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Bree', 'compassionate', 'best', 'friend/therapist', 'had', 'lauged', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'post', 'surgery', 'scene', 'just', 'moved', 'massive', 'tears', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'generated', 'best', 'performance', 'Filicity', 'Huffman', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'take', 'home', 'gold', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Oscar', 'year']",N/A
