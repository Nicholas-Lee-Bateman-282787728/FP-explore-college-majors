733341,A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I,B0000844IS,,"[3, 4]","""Nick Knight"" is  a cool movie to have and own. It is one that fans of the TV series will want, but it isn't as good as the Ger Davies TV series. There is no Natalie, Janette is unattractive and LaCroix is no where near as cool as he is when played by Nigel. It's not only those shallow points, but there is just no chemistry between the cast and characters. Janette and Nick seem like enemies, and there is no real sense of hate towards LaCroix for becoming a vampire. The entire movie just has a different feel.The music, I have to admit, is quite good if you like the music from the decade. These were songs I knew very well, so it was enjoyable to hear them in the movie. Overall, fans will want to see this movie, but those who aren't fans may actually like it more. You just can't beat the relationships the characters have on the TV series, and it is obviously missing here-even compared to the ""Forever Knight"" version of this movie.",3,"Decent, but Give Me ""Forever Knight""",1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,941,"['Nick', 'Knight', 'cool', 'movie', 'have', 'own', 'one', 'fans', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'want', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Ger', 'Davies', 'TV', 'series', 'Natalie', 'Janette', 'unattractive', 'LaCroix', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'cool', 'when', 'played', 'Nigel', 'not', 'only', 'shallow', 'points', 'just', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'characters', 'Janette', 'Nick', 'seem', 'enemies', 'real', 'sense', 'hate', 'towards', 'LaCroix', 'becoming', 'vampire', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'different', 'feel.The', 'music', 'have', 'admit', 'quite', 'good', 'like', 'music', 'decade', 'were', 'songs', 'knew', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'hear', 'movie', 'Overall', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'may', 'actually', 'like', 'more', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'relationships', 'characters', 'have', 'TV', 'series', 'obviously', 'missing', 'here-even', 'compared', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'version', 'movie']",N/A

733348,A1ONH3UF7F4WMB,B0000844IS,"Daniel T. Noe ""Jesus Freak""","[3, 4]","The 1989 T.V. flick 'Nick Knight' tells us about the life of a man who's trying to forget his past and start on a new life. Nick Knight, played by Rick Springfield, is a cop who is investigating the murders of innocent homeless people, each having their blood pumped from their bodies. On the verge of discovering who is responsible for the horrible deaths, Nick is called in to a museum to find a murdered security guard whose blood is pumped from his body. But Nick notices that this one is different than the other deaths, the guard's blood was sucked from his neck with two bite marks. The killer has also stolen a rare Mayan goblet that is very valuable. Nick now has to deal with two murderers, one of them a vampire.Nick's only witness is the museum archeologist Alice Hunter, a beautiful and intelligent woman who falls in love with Nick when they meet. She loves the way he dresses, his black hair and young handsome face she can never take her eyes off of. But what she doesn't know is that Nick is not an ordinary man, Nick is over two hundred years old and is not mortal. Nick Knight is a vampire.Nick has to find the vampire who killed the security guard and stoled the Mayan Goblet, for the goblet can help turn Nick back into a human being. Nick knows that Lacroix, the vampire that turned Nick into one, is responsible for the murder and the theft. Without the goblet, Nick cannot become a human being again and will have to live for eternity, being tormented with the thirst for blood and watching the ones that he love grow old and die in front of his eyes. Nick tracks down Lacroix and the two vampires engage in a violent and dramatic battle over the goblet.Mixed with horror, romance, humor, and drama, Nick Knight is an amazing and perhaps the best vampire movie ever. Rick Springfield delivers his best performance in acting. Although the special effects aren't spectacular, the script and actors are what make this an awesome movie.

733355,AEIPZ7QBQ9OIL,B0000844IS,Keaton Fan,"[1, 1]","Rick Springfield is equally adept at acting and music, an all-too-rare combination. In fact, he's the only musician/actor I can think of who can really do both. In this film, he is perfectly cast as an LA cop who works nights, successfully hiding the fact that he is also a vampire. When a series of murders strikes Los Angeles, Knight (Springfield) is the investigating officer, along with his new, obnoxious partner (John Kapelos). The connecting thread among the murders is that all the victims are homeless - and all have been drained of blood.When another murder is committed in which the victim has been drained of blood, yet all the other marks of the crime differ from the usual pattern, the case takes a strange twist for Knight.I wish that the film had been written with a stronger female character. Alyce Hunter, who is supposed to be a brilliant archeologist, does some of the stupidest things I've ever seen in a film. She chases Knight down an alley (trying not to be seen or heard) in high heels. She tries to attack another vampire with a dowel. She tips her hand too early. A better actress would have done more with the role, but Laura Johnson is simply awful. She's awkward, angular, and looks as if she's wondering when the shot will be over, so she can go hide somewhere. I can't believe that she was cast as a woman with whom Knight is supposed to make a fast emotional connection. She looks more like a bundle of neurosis held together by very fine wire. Why on earth was she cast? Not only does she sink every scene she's in, she damages the movie as a whole.Johnson (and her character) aside, this was a nifty film showing modern life for a vampire. Where does he go during the day? How much daylight can he handle? Where does he get his food? Does anyone else know what he is? The film offers interesting answers to these questions.If you like Rick Springfield, or if you like vampire films, this is one for you.

733358,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B0000844IS,Michael R Gates,"[107, 107]","In the 1989 TV flick NICK KNIGHT, rocker (1981's Grammy-winning &quot;Jessie's Girl&quot;) and soap-opera star (GENERAL HOSPITAL, 1981-1983) Rick Springfield portrays Nick Knight, a homicide detective on the night shift who has a reputation for being a loner and a maverick.  But he's a good cop, and he's hip.  He drives a cool vintage Caddy, looks good in black leather, and has a soft spot in his heart for the homeless (he often checks up on them when he's out on his &quot;beat&quot;).  Oh, yeah--and he's also a guilt-ridden vampire in quest of a cure for his supernatural malady.  Solving crimes, specifically homicides, is sort of his way of paying penance for the murderous, blood-sucking sins of his past.Though often neglected or overlooked, NICK KNIGHT is an intelligent, skillfully written, and well-acted TV film that was actually the original pilot for the popular cult TV series FOREVER KNIGHT (1992-1996).  One reason that this film is nearly forgotten might be the fact that the same story was re-shot with the TV cast and subsequently aired as the series' two-part opener.  While the cast of the series does a fine job-the excellent cast is, of course, one of many reasons that the show quickly became a cult favorite--NICK KNIGHT is in many ways superior to the two-part remake, and it is therefore unfortunate that the series has eclipsed the original film and pushed it into near obscurity.The acting in NICK KNIGHT is superb, especially considering that it is a made-for-TV flick.  In the titular role, Springfield delivers a strong, convincing performance and has great chemistry with the rest of the cast.  Also intriguing is Laura Johnson, who plays museum curator Alyce Hunter and Knight's love interest.  Not only is she a good actress and quite attractive, but Ms. Johnson and Springfield really sizzle together when they share screen time.  Genre fans might recognize Michael Nader from his role as Nicolas Pike in TV's short-lived 1990 series THE FLASH, but couch potatoes are more likely to recognize him from his long-standing role as Farnsworth Dexter on TV's nighttime soap DYNASTY.  Here he plays Nick's longtime nemesis, Lacroix. (Nader does a good job in the role, though he is admittedly not as compelling--nor as accomplished an actor--as Nigel Bennett, who assumes the role in the series.)  As the film's comic relief, John Kapelos is hilariously entertaining in the role of Nick's annoyingly self-absorbed partner Don Schanke, and he often steals the scenes he is in.  Interestingly, Kapelos is the only actor in the film who returns to reprise his role for the TV series.The film itself has really stood up well over time.  Aside from the 1980's pop tunes in the soundtrack and a few cheesy special FX, there isn't much that reveals NICK KNIGHT to be a product of late-1980s TV.  The script is tight and interesting, the characters are likable and realistic, the directing is top-notch, and, as mentioned before, the acting is excellent.  All in all, the film is a forgotten gem that, like its vampire characters, deserves to rise from the dead and live forever.And thanks to the folks at Anchor Bay, NICK KNIGHT has been resurrected on DVD.  True, he offering is a bare-bones disc--i.e., there are no extras or bonus features--but the digital transfer is drastically better than the previous VHS releases of the film, and the sound quality is pretty good. And being a telefilm, it is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1.For fans of the TV show FOREVER KNIGHT who did not see this pilot film prior to the creation of the series, it might take a little time to warm up to the alternate actors and the character variations.  But if viewed an open mind, any fan of the TV series should enjoy NICK KNIGHT, and any fan of the vampire genre will want to add the DVD of this excellent film to their collections.Definitely worth amazon.com's reasonable price of admission.",4,He Wants to Repay Society for His Sins....,1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,3920,"['1989', 'TV', 'flick', 'NICK', 'KNIGHT', 'rocker', '1981', 'Grammy-winning', 'quot', 'Jessie', 'Girl', 'quot', 'soap-opera', 'star', 'GENERAL', 'HOSPITAL', '1981-1983', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'Nick', 'Knight', 'homicide', 'detective', 'night', 'shift', 'who', 'reputation', 'being', 'loner', 'maverick', 'good', 'cop', 'hip', 'cool', 'vintage', 'Caddy', 'good', 'black', 'leather', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'homeless', 'often', 'up', 'when', 'out', 'quot', 'quot', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'also', 'guilt-ridden', 'vampire', 'quest', 'cure', 'supernatural', 'malady', 'Solving', 'crimes', 'specifically', 'homicides', 'sort', 'way', 'paying', 'penance', 'murderous', 'blood-sucking', 'sins', 'past.Though', 'often', 'neglected', 'overlooked', 'NICK', 'KNIGHT', 'intelligent', 'skillfully', 'written', 'well-acted', 'TV', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'original', 'pilot', 'popular', 'cult', 'TV', 'series', 'FOREVER', 'KNIGHT', '1992-1996', 'One', 'reason', 'film', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'might', 'be', 'fact', 'same', 'story', 'was', 're-shot', 'TV', 'cast', 'subsequently', 'aired', 'series', 'two-part', 'opener', 'cast', 'series', 'fine', 'job-the', 'excellent', 'cast', 'course', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'show', 'quickly', 'became', 'cult', 'favorite', 'NICK', 'KNIGHT', 'many', 'ways', 'superior', 'two-part', 'remake', 'therefore', 'unfortunate', 'series', 'eclipsed', 'original', 'film', 'pushed', 'obscurity.The', 'acting', 'NICK', 'KNIGHT', 'superb', 'especially', 'considering', 'made-for-TV', 'flick', 'titular', 'role', 'Springfield', 'strong', 'convincing', 'performance', 'great', 'chemistry', 'rest', 'cast', 'Also', 'intriguing', 'Laura', 'Johnson', 'who', 'museum', 'curator', 'Alyce', 'Hunter', 'Knight', 'love', 'interest', 'Not', 'only', 'good', 'actress', 'quite', 'attractive', 'Ms.', 'Johnson', 'Springfield', 'really', 'sizzle', 'together', 'when', 'share', 'screen', 'time', 'Genre', 'fans', 'might', 'recognize', 'Michael', 'Nader', 'role', 'Nicolas', 'Pike', 'TV', 'short-lived', '1990', 'series', 'THE', 'FLASH', 'couch', 'potatoes', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'recognize', 'long-standing', 'role', 'Farnsworth', 'Dexter', 'TV', 'nighttime', 'soap', 'DYNASTY', 'Here', 'Nick', 'longtime', 'nemesis', 'Lacroix', 'Nader', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'admittedly', 'not', 'compelling', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'Nigel', 'Bennett', 'who', 'role', 'series', 'film', 'comic', 'relief', 'John', 'Kapelos', 'hilariously', 'entertaining', 'role', 'Nick', 'annoyingly', 'self-absorbed', 'partner', 'Don', 'Schanke', 'often', 'scenes', 'Interestingly', 'Kapelos', 'only', 'actor', 'film', 'who', 'reprise', 'role', 'TV', 'series.The', 'film', 'really', 'stood', 'up', 'well', 'time', 'Aside', '1980', 'pop', 'tunes', 'soundtrack', 'few', 'cheesy', 'special', 'FX', ""n't"", 'much', 'NICK', 'KNIGHT', 'be', 'product', 'late-1980s', 'TV', 'script', 'tight', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'realistic', 'directing', 'top-notch', 'mentioned', 'acting', 'excellent', 'film', 'forgotten', 'gem', 'vampire', 'characters', 'deserves', 'rise', 'dead', 'live', 'forever.And', 'thanks', 'folks', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'NICK', 'KNIGHT', 'been', 'resurrected', 'DVD', 'True', 'offering', 'bare-bones', 'disc', 'i.e.', 'are', 'extras', 'bonus', 'features', 'digital', 'transfer', 'drastically', 'better', 'previous', 'VHS', 'releases', 'film', 'sound', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'being', 'telefilm', 'presented', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.33:1.For', 'fans', 'TV', 'show', 'FOREVER', 'KNIGHT', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'pilot', 'film', 'prior', 'creation', 'series', 'might', 'take', 'little', 'time', 'warm', 'up', 'alternate', 'actors', 'character', 'variations', 'viewed', 'open', 'mind', 'fan', 'TV', 'series', 'should', 'enjoy', 'NICK', 'KNIGHT', 'fan', 'vampire', 'genre', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'film', 'collections.Definitely', 'worth', 'amazon.com', 'reasonable', 'price', 'admission']",N/A

There is also jeanette the beautiful sophisticated french woman vampiress who owns a night club/vampire hangout called Raven. This interesting cast of characters adds to a great plotIn modern times Nick becomes a cop his partner Skanky drives him nuts but Skanky is a good guy their interaction is at times comical, Nick later on meets ( Natalie ) who is the coroner besides doing autopsys she is helping Nick not only with his job and cases but in his quest to become human again. For those who haven't seen the tv series ( Forever Knight ) I highly reccomend ( Geriant Wyn Davies ) plays Nick Knight in that but characters from this movie are in the series to a big plus.

Network television was going through one of its periodic obsessions with police procedural shows and the introduction of a vampire to the night shift of a metropolitan police force had a certain amount of appeal.The show that finally ran (Forever Knight) was quite a bit different and therein lies some of the appeal of watching this movie-- the chance to compare and contrast.  I had just recently bought the first season of Forever Knight so I had a prime opportunity here.This version is slicker, with an 80's rock background that has a certain retro appeal.  It was obviously shot in a warmer climate.  Rick Springfield has a lean and hungry look that contibutes to his tortured vampire character as he runs the gamut of emotion from tormented to tormented.  While probably a better actor, Geraint Wynn Davies who played the character in the series, has to fight against his sleek, blond appearance.  Somehow it is easier to look as if you have a brooding, soul-destroying secret if you are a brunette.I also really enjoyed the contrast between Nick's starvling, blood junkie pose and Alyce Hunter, the Mayan scholar, constantly stuffing herself with junk food.  I also enjoyed her look since Wardrobe apparently dressed her from Banana Republic back in the good old days before BR became a mall shop.Anyway, the movie is not bad at all if you are in the mood for some vampire mind candy with a bit of retro.",4,Vampire on the Night Shift,1070841600,"12 8, 2003",2003,1471,"['remember', 'watching', 'when', 'premiered', 'television', 'Network', 'television', 'was', 'going', 'one', 'periodic', 'obsessions', 'police', 'procedural', 'shows', 'introduction', 'vampire', 'night', 'shift', 'metropolitan', 'police', 'force', 'had', 'certain', 'amount', 'appeal.The', 'show', 'finally', 'ran', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'therein', 'appeal', 'watching', 'movie', 'chance', 'compare', 'contrast', 'had', 'just', 'recently', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'had', 'prime', 'opportunity', 'here.This', 'version', 'slicker', '80', 'rock', 'background', 'certain', 'retro', 'appeal', 'was', 'obviously', 'shot', 'warmer', 'climate', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'lean', 'hungry', 'look', 'tortured', 'vampire', 'character', 'gamut', 'emotion', 'tormented', 'tormented', 'probably', 'better', 'actor', 'Geraint', 'Wynn', 'Davies', 'who', 'played', 'character', 'series', 'fight', 'sleek', 'blond', 'appearance', 'Somehow', 'easier', 'look', 'have', 'brooding', 'soul-destroying', 'secret', 'are', 'brunette.I', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'contrast', 'Nick', 'starvling', 'blood', 'junkie', 'pose', 'Alyce', 'Hunter', 'Mayan', 'scholar', 'constantly', 'stuffing', 'junk', 'food', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'look', 'Wardrobe', 'apparently', 'dressed', 'Banana', 'Republic', 'back', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'BR', 'became', 'mall', 'shop.Anyway', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'mood', 'vampire', 'mind', 'candy', 'bit', 'retro']",N/A
