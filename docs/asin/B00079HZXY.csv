878880,A3AGD72LZ0ZRBL,B00079HZXY,"Bad movie buster ""BMB""","[2, 19]","Let's see: this movie was made in 2001, has been sitting on a shelf for four years, and was just released on video with no fanfare whatsoever.  Could this be a 4 or 5 star movie as my fellow reviewers are claiming?  Give me a break.  You know, I really regret that I, the Bad Movie Buster, must constantly post on this site.  But what choice do I have, when the shills and hucksters for the movie studios and the movie rental chains keep loading up this site with bogus reviews in order to boost business?  So here I am again, trying to save me fellow movie lovers from making bad choices.  A few years ago, I was in a movie theater and I saw a trailer for a movie called ""Slap Her, She's French.""  The movie never came out, and I assumed it was because of the un-PC title.  Yet, the movie was just released on video under this title of ""She Gets What She Wants"" and it is obvious that the lack of any laughs or an interesting plot are the reasons why this dud never made it to theaters.  All of the characters are completely one dimensional rip-offs of every other character you've seen in every other teen movie comedy: the clueless parents; the younger brother who helps to save the day; stuck up cheerleaders.

878883,AVO9QQWRRXESK,B00079HZXY,Heather Hays,"[10, 10]","I admit that at the beginning of this, I had my doubts but by the end I was laughing my head off.The movie begins in Texas ""where even the sky is bigger"" and parts of it are kind of hilariously exaggerated if you have ever lived Texas. The main characters wear big sunglasses and shiny fake alligator skin suits in shades of neon pink and yellow with cowboy boots.Neither of the two characters are sympathetic at the beginning of the movie, but it's fun to watch them get what's coming to them as the film progresses. The main character, Starla is a self absorbed high school cheerleader with the perfect boyfriend and a thick southern accent. Her dream is of someday crossing the state line and being an anchor for ""Good Morning America"". She volunteers to host an exchange student to win a beauty pageant after one of the other contestants steals her sure-fire answer to any pageant question by bringing up the lord.In the beginning, she's totally self absorbed and irritating. But by the end she gets more than her share of what she deserves.There are some great twists in the movie and a couple of parts that are a litle more subtle but still funny.For instance, in one scene, the girls in Starla's clique ask a guy that work on the school paper what he's wearing.He answers ""A T-shirt"" and they then point out in heavy southern accents that ""it ain't got no label on it"".In another part, Starla wakes up during a sleepover and her two best friends are sleeping on the floor together in their underwear, spooning. She glances at them, shakes her head in puzzlement and looks at them again before she leaves the room. When they catch up with her downstairs they mention that they ""slept well.""If you watch this movie at all, the part where Starla ends up in jail makes most of the earlier fluff worth it.

878885,AU2V2ZKMZFNY6,B00079HZXY,"JR Corry ""Jenny""","[4, 14]","That was a rhetorical question, of course, but this movie chose to answer in the negative anyway. I was hoping this trite silliness wouldn't make it to DVD, but some filmmakers will push anything. When I first saw the preview for this, I was drawn to it because it looked like an interesting story about the interplay between two rival girls and I'll admit that I'm sometimes still drawn to the drama and trauma of highschool.While watching the preview, I wasn't sure which girl I was supposed to root for; the blonde was annoying and full of herself, while the redhead seemed rather underhanded and sly. The movie, however, seems to push Starla (the blonde) as heroine, a role which she is simply not cut out to play. As a popular rich blonde cheerleader (anyone see the stereotype there?), Starla is an extremely unlikeable snob with an unbearable Texan accent and a strong streak of proud stupidity which makes her think she's the ideal teen with the perfect life. (And again, she is supposed to be our heroine). Enter Genevieve, French exchange student (and aforementioned redhead) who Starla's family takes in and Starla attempts to take under her over-buffeted wing. Of course, Genevieve isn't what she seems and pretty soon she starts trying to take over Starla's ""life"", aka her cheerleading position, boyfriend, parental spotlight, etc.Remember when I said Starla's unlikeable? This hasn't changed since the beginning of the story; in fact, once Genevieve enters the picture, Starla becomes more intolerable than ever. Her condescending ""friendship"" is so transparent a blind man could see through it, and even though Genevieve supposedly lost her entire family in France, Starla still insists on flaunting her perfect life in front of her. The last straw for me was when she gave Genevieve a big hug and exclaimed, ""Oh, I'm so glad your family died so you could come here!"" And we're supposed to feel sorry for her when things go downhill? By the time Genevieve started trying to ruin things for Starla, I was practicaly cheering for her! The little bimbo deserved to have her illusion of perfection stripped away. Unfortunetly, the movie doesn't stop here.Genevieve, of course, goes way overboard in her quest to ruin Starla and soon frames her for drug carrying. When Starla was whisked off to prison, I knew the film had lost all reality and dropped all pretenses of trying to be good. For some reason I kept watching anyway, only to see what is possibly the dumbest conclusion I've ever seen in a movie. Suffice it to say that Starla attempts to take back her crown in self-righteous fury and Genevieve the-black-hearted-villain is defeated. As if this silly tripe isn't enough, the filmmakers seemed determined to make us think that Texans are the dumbest and most annoying people on Earth. (If this is some sort of poorly executed anti-Bush statement, I suggest you stop beating the dead horse, people; as a registered Democrat, I can honestly say it's not funny anymore)The old teens-are-stupid-and-evil stereotype isn't funny either, especially not if you add the dumb-parent one to it. Starla's parents, if possible, are even dumber than she is; when Genevieve announces in public that Starla has been arrested for drug-dealing (which her parents know nothing about), her parents give each other confused looks, frown, than go right back to listening to Genevieve with no other reaction!Sorry I wasted my time watching this on TV, but at least I didn't waste my money buying it.

I haven't caught any other films by the lead actress.  But I have actually SEEN the movie, not just the trailer.As for the flick, what with cartoonish characters, plot improbabilities, and obvious reverses, you'd think I'd hate this trifle.  You'd be wrong.Late summer movies are rarely anything other than entertaining.  This is not a bad thing.  And a chance to see multiple female-on-female fights is brought to hilarious fruition.Like any good comedy, it is built on a bedrock of tragedy and horror.  Our Heroine is a girl who'll do anything to become a co-host on The Today Show.  Her dippy boyfriend is the quarterback for the school team who seems destined for a coronary at 20.  Her mother is an alcoholic.  Her father is a bitter romantic.  She stabs even her best friends in the back.  Lesbians (or more accurately, women who are perceived as lesbian) are ridiculed.  The little brother is a snide, jaded fellow.Then comes the transfer student.  Who, like Eve in All About Eve, watches and waits to take over every aspect of Starla's life.  She sucks up the parents, the cheerleading spot, and the dippy boyfriend.  Then all hell breaks loose, slowly at first, then with a vengeance.  And that is what this movie is about: vengeance.Funny. Yes.  Laugh-out-loud funny?  Absolutely.  Worth your time?  Yes, if you want fairly mindless entertainment.  And especially if you love mock battles feminine.P.S. Slap Her, She's French is a funny title.  Not cause for a PC war.  This movie doesn't pick on the French any more than the rest of US society.  We think they look down their noses at us.  That makes us believe it's OK to give them grief.
