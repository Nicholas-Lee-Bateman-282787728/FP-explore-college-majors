Of course its not even comparable to the original but its not that bad. Its entertaining to a point. Emily Bergl as Rachel Lang is a lot diffrent than the original Carrie. But its the late 90s now and she still has that misfit aspect about her. Not as bad as Carrie, she seems more of an individual, more sure of herself and confident than Carrie did yet she still seems to be the target of the over sexed jocks and popular people.Soon after one of the over sexed jocks takes advantage of her best friend Lisa, ''Mena Suvari''- she ends up commiting suicide by jumping off the school. The police end up bringing one of the boys in for questioniong. After this incident Rachel becomes their target and they hatch a plan to humiliate her.. Meanwhile the school counselor, Amy Irving is trying to help Rachel, she sees what is coming because she experienced the incident with Carrie back in the 70's and see's Rachel has the same power as Carrie did.Theres a lot of things in this movie that tell us more about Carries father, the powers he had, how Rachel is connected with Carrie, etc. We learn a little more about the original character as well as the new one.The film was good up until the end. I was expecting a lot more.

Now having said that I can move on and give my opinion about this highly entertaining MTVstyle/GENx Movie. This movie was alot better than I expected. I thought the new character ""Rachel Lang"" (aka New Carrie) Emily Bergl was great as the tortured half sister of Carrie who honestly tries to control her genetic disorder (telekinesis) which she inherited from her infamous sister and Carrie's father and hers...The actual portrayal of the  mean popular kids was a bit contrived they seemed like they had nothing better to do than pick on Carrie. In real life although there are alot of jerks in school I do not think their main concern is messing with unpopular people. I was a bit puzzled as why they thought Rachel was ugly I thought she was attractive and also prettier than some of the ""popular girls"" but that is another story. I thought the movie had a great rhythm It was not overlong nor boring. Jason London as the sole good guy who really liked Rachel was good too and brought some humanity to an otherwise jerk cast. The climax which paralleled the famous prom scene was a justified (they pushed her to the brink after ridiculing her cruelly although this cast didnt just stand there like helpless creatures but actually wounded her and tried to kill her. Note: (Murder is never the answer for Bullying)...This movie was pretty Good!IF you are looking to a Better Carrie movie this is not the movie. If you are looking to judge sequels as the original you will be happy there is plenty for you to pick apart. This movie is simply a sequel plain and simple and aimed not at expert filmmaking or filmgoers but generation x and Y . I do not think anyone over the age of 30 would like this. However it is good entertainment take it at face value.

E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I can honestly say, I can't remember the original Carrie at the moment I'm writing this review, and I probably haven't seen the the film in at least 20 years. Keep that in mind while I write up my thoughts on the Rage: Carrie 2.  I can't compare this film to the original.Emily Bergl nails her performance as a troubled teenager with the incredible power to move objects with her mind. This ability however, wasn't used excessively, which is *exactly* how it should've been used. Abusing such a magical ability would have done more harm than good as far as storyline development is concerned and would have made the story totally unbelievable.  Used in small doses however, was much more effective.Emily's character kept her telekinesis power to herself most of the time, except for when a guidance counselor tried helping her, and accidentally made the girl upset, prompting her to use the power.The ending of Carrie 2 made any moment of nonsense or boredom you may have experienced beforehand TOTALLY worth it. She goes absolutely nuts, and you have to see what she does with her ability, and what causes her to use it.As far as the amount of scares is concerned, truth be told there weren't that many. A couple VERY weird scenes had some graphic and shocking shots, and that's about it. Honestly, this entire movie was very weird to me. It had a pacing that was entirely unpredictable, but somehow made sense by the conclusion. I really enjoyed it.The only complaint is that after a certain point there was a bit too much of a focus on the relationship building between the teenager and her boyfriend which led to a few slightly overlong romantic scenes, but that's a VERY minor flaw.Overall, very good movie.",5,I loved it,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,1712,"['can', 'honestly', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'original', 'Carrie', 'moment', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'least', '20', 'years', 'Keep', 'mind', 'write', 'up', 'thoughts', 'Rage', 'Carrie', '2', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'film', 'original.Emily', 'Bergl', 'performance', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'incredible', 'power', 'move', 'objects', 'mind', 'ability', 'however', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'excessively', '*exactly*', 'how', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'used', 'Abusing', 'such', 'magical', 'ability', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'storyline', 'development', 'concerned', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'story', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'Used', 'small', 'doses', 'however', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'effective.Emily', 'character', 'kept', 'telekinesis', 'power', 'most', 'time', 'when', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'tried', 'helping', 'accidentally', 'made', 'girl', 'upset', 'prompting', 'use', 'power.The', 'ending', 'Carrie', '2', 'made', 'moment', 'nonsense', 'boredom', 'may', 'have', 'experienced', 'beforehand', 'TOTALLY', 'absolutely', 'nuts', 'have', 'see', 'what', 'ability', 'what', 'use', 'it.As', 'far', 'amount', 'scares', 'concerned', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'many', 'couple', 'VERY', 'weird', 'scenes', 'had', 'graphic', 'shocking', 'shots', 'Honestly', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'weird', 'had', 'pacing', 'was', 'entirely', 'unpredictable', 'somehow', 'made', 'sense', 'conclusion', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'certain', 'point', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'relationship', 'building', 'teenager', 'boyfriend', 'led', 'few', 'slightly', 'overlong', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'VERY', 'minor', 'flaw.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

I am also a huge fan of the original ""Carrie"" (1976).As a horror fan, I believe this film delivers in so many ways.  I don't believe this film was made to compete or be like the original ""Carrie"".  I think it was made to carry on the story of psychokenesis.To me, this is a well-rounded horror film.  You get a good plot, a love story, evil teenagers, modern special effects, and some new gore.I'm not sure why this film is so hated by people, and even fans of the genre.  I've heard that people think that the kids sharing a videotape of Rachel having sex at a party would never happen.  That teenagers wouldn't do something like, even in this day & age.  I'm a little surprised that people buy into teenagers killing a pig, draining the blood, fixing the Prom so that Carrie wins as Queen, and dumping the pig blood over her.I'm glad this film was made.  It's a lot of fun to watch, especially when all hell breaks loose at the party!  The kills are totally awesome....my personal favorite being that of Rachel Blanchard's character....the female that wears eyeglasses.

Litton,"[1, 2]","Every critic thinks terrible thoughts... many were thinking, &quot;SHAM!&quot; upon viewing the movie &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2.&quot; An utterly resistable piece of filmmaking, the movie, directed by Katt Shea and starring a semi-lucid cast of teenage actors, tries to add to the plot of the original movie with little success and much blasphemy.It's present-day, and Bates High School is bustling with the usual teenage activity: people going to class, hanging out with friends, jocks sleeping with girls as a game of who gets the most points... like I said, the usual teenage activity. Among one of these girls is Lisa, who happens to be friends with Rachel, the resident campus &quot;freak.&quot; Lisa, who has lost her virginity to one of the football jocks, jumps from the top of the building and kills herself, which brings to the attention of Rachel the knowledge of the facts surrounding Lisa's death. While the jocks are doing everything they can to keep Rachel's mouth shut about certain events, one softy jock, Jesse, becomes enticed by Rachel, befriending her and soon becoming her boyfriend. All of this storyline is accompanied by the sidestory of Rachel's telekinesis and the origins of her power: she is Carrie White's half sister.The plotline of the film does make a small amount of sense, but not by a long shot. While trying to come off as an intelligent thriller that will continue the original story, it comes off as sounding juvenile and ineffective through the execution of the story as well as most of the acting on the actors' parts. Emily Bergl gives a slightly credible performance as Rachel, and in some instances, she has her moments of sentiment and feeling. This is the extent of the acting as a whole, and the rest is left to dwell on cliche teenage one-liners and conversations that are as brainless as the filmmakers. Under the direction of Katt Shea, who came onto the project in mid-filming, the film suffers from a lack of feeling or emotion, far below the level contained in Brian de Palma's shocking and highly emotional original film. To sum it all up, this is one movie that the world could live without; a blatant waste of money and so-called talent.The DVD edition of this film is average in its design; the film is beautifully presented, but the overall lack of special features ruin the experience. Image quality is sharp with highly saturated colors and crisp edges, yet in some scenes the picture is wanting in clarity. Sound design is somewhat effective, really only able to engage in all channels during the flashback scenes and the gruesome party scene. The only special features on this disc are deleted scenes, director's commentary, and and alternate ending sequence. Where's the theatrical trailer? Where's the making-of featurette?

It's rare that a movie puts itself squarely in the stinker pile during its first two minutes, but The Rage:  Carrie 2 pulled it off.  Right from that ridiculous paint sequence, which seems to want to be both  campy and dramatic at the same time, you can tell that a cinematic schmuck  is behind the camera.It doesn't matter that Shea (whose credits include  the horrendous Poison Ivy and Stripped to Kill II:  Live Girls) tries to  show off with black-and-white footage, slow-motion, sped up shots and fast  in-out zooms (an antique device that should've been buried with those Bruce  Lee movies).  Her ineptitude with actors, shots, pacing, and even music  (about 40 minutes in the film shouldn't have been scored) shows with every  frame.  The heinous script doesn't help, with characters saying the most  unsuitable things in the dramatic situation and basically turning into  human exposition machines.  Emily Bergl in the lead role isn't so much  incompetent as unable to save a badly written and directed character -- by  never establishing &quot;Rachel&quot; as a sympathetic character in the  first 40 minutes, Shea doomed the character to be a stereotype.  Bergl  seems capable of more, but there's nothing that can be done under such an  incompetent director.It astounds me, then, that somehow a great actress  like Mena Suvari (who held her own in a mesmerizing performance in American  Beauty, a film populated by classic performances by Kevin Spacey, Thora  Birch, Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper).  Her role is minimal in this film,  yes, but that was an actor who might have put a bit of life into this  movie.  As it stands, even her role (best friend, Lisa) falters even if  Suvari doesn't -- we don't get any real connection to her relationship to  the Bergl character, so when Rachel loses Lisa, there's no emotional  impact...just the awful aftertaste of Shea's terrible shot selection.  Don't even mention &quot;horror&quot; -- the only thing this movie made me  feel is utter contempt; this movie made me laugh not with it but at it,  namely, at its worse-than-amateurish execution.And yes...the climactic  showdown...a ripoff of both the original Carrie and, of all things,  Hellraiser III:  Hell on Earth.Run away as fast as you can.

149265,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0792842960,Erik North,"[5, 8]","What we've got with THE RAGE: CARRIE 2 is what I like to call a &quot;curiously frustrating&quot; movie.Why anyone thought it was necessary to sequelize Brian De Palma's great 1976 film CARRIE is a mystery...unless one takes the money angle into account.  There are good things about it, but there are bad things about it that make it rather uneven.The good: Emily Bergl's performance as Rachel, the &quot;half-sister&quot; of Carrie White, is really something else.  Nothing about her performance is taken away when it's noted that she's not Sissy Spacek.  The idea of &quot;high school as Hell&quot; is updated to the present, but is as effective for 1999 as the original was to 1976.  Jason London also scores as the only sympathetic member of the jock clique that really wants to do Rachel in.  And finally, for the most part, director Katt Shea manages to build a certain amount of suspense in the Hitchcock/DePalma/Spielberg tradition.The bad: The jocks, led by Dylan Bruno, are so unremmitingly repulsive.  The explanation for Rachel's telekinesis is extremely far-fetched.  Amy Irving's return as Sue Snell (who is now a guidance counselor) is marked by her having little to do and by having her unceremoniously killed off.  The film really goes off the rails, however, in the climax, set in a rich jock's mansion; it is a partial remake of the original's prom scene in which the blood and gore are upped to extreme levels, but there's none of the same drama and tragedy that marked the firestorm in the 1976 classic.CARRIE 2, thus, seems like an afterthought, an attempt to wean the SCREAM/URBAN LEGEND crowd while unwisely using clips from the original to connect the two films.  Were it not for Bergl's and London's performances, this would barely rank two stars, possibly even one.  I give CARRIE 2 a marginal recommendation; but for a real combination of psychological horror and drama, the original still beats all the new kids on the block hands down.",3,THE RAGE: CARRIE 2--Good but not great,995587200,"07 20, 2001",2001,1966,"['What', ""'ve"", 'got', 'RAGE', 'CARRIE', '2', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'quot', 'curiously', 'frustrating', 'quot', 'anyone', 'thought', 'was', 'necessary', 'sequelize', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'great', '1976', 'film', 'CARRIE', 'mystery', 'one', 'money', 'angle', 'account', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'are', 'bad', 'things', 'make', 'rather', 'uneven.The', 'good', 'Emily', 'Bergl', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'quot', 'half-sister', 'quot', 'Carrie', 'White', 'really', 'something', 'else', 'Nothing', 'performance', 'taken', 'away', 'when', 'noted', 'not', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'idea', 'quot', 'high', 'school', 'Hell', 'quot', 'updated', 'present', 'as', 'effective', '1999', 'original', 'was', '1976', 'Jason', 'London', 'also', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'member', 'jock', 'clique', 'really', 'do', 'Rachel', 'finally', 'most', 'part', 'director', 'Katt', 'Shea', 'build', 'certain', 'amount', 'suspense', 'Hitchcock/DePalma/Spielberg', 'tradition.The', 'bad', 'jocks', 'led', 'Dylan', 'Bruno', 'are', 'so', 'unremmitingly', 'repulsive', 'explanation', 'Rachel', 'telekinesis', 'extremely', 'far-fetched', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'return', 'Sue', 'Snell', 'who', 'now', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'marked', 'having', 'little', 'do', 'having', 'unceremoniously', 'killed', 'off', 'film', 'really', 'rails', 'however', 'climax', 'set', 'rich', 'jock', 'mansion', 'partial', 'remake', 'original', 'prom', 'scene', 'blood', 'gore', 'are', 'upped', 'extreme', 'levels', 'none', 'same', 'drama', 'tragedy', 'marked', 'firestorm', '1976', 'classic.CARRIE', '2', 'thus', 'afterthought', 'attempt', 'wean', 'SCREAM/URBAN', 'LEGEND', 'crowd', 'unwisely', 'using', 'clips', 'original', 'connect', 'two', 'films', 'Were', 'not', 'Bergl', 'London', 'performances', 'would', 'barely', 'rank', 'two', 'stars', 'possibly', 'even', 'one', 'give', '2', 'marginal', 'recommendation', 'real', 'combination', 'psychological', 'horror', 'drama', 'original', 'still', 'new', 'kids', 'block', 'down']",N/A

Then again, when you analyze the two movies, neither is very good from a horror movie fan's perspective, but I must say that that movie is not too bad...it is fair to average.  In other words, I give it slightly over 2 stars which is about the equivalent of a ""C"" grade.Basically, the movie's plot involves a girl named Rachael who has similar if not identical powers to that of Carrie in the first flick.  She also has that same ""bad"" temper...in many ways, this movie is very similar to the first.  Like Carrie, Rachael is also estranged from the rest of her fellow students in highschool except for one girl who kills herself in a very realistic scene in the beginning of the movie.

You sort of care for the characters but more so for the inevitable tragic doom that will happen. It kept me anxious & guessing through out. There is a classic line in the early classroom scene giving a preluding hint about the romance between the lead actors. The teacher asked about the class's view on love & Romeo & Juliet, & only 2 people answered. London believed in love. Bergl on the other hand was more cynical about it. You could tell from that scene what the love interests were going to be with. A very appropriate hint & a prophetic line. At the end of the movie I found the climax to be very impactfull & very very gory (all the better). You actually cared and sympathised with Carrie. The football jocks deserved everything they got. It was a great lesson to teach high school students to value & respect the opposite sex & not just use them for animal sport sex. And of course bullying is bad. While not the real life solution to the problem, it raised the issue in true Generation X style, and serving as morale and warning not to do it. There is a few surprises at the ending that will have you a bit startled too. I was very disappointed with the editorial amazon review above. I thought it was too harsh. The only criticism I have of it is the romance was a bit lame & unbelievable. The more I think about it I don't believe they could have fallen in love in such a short amount of time. But ironically you do end up caring for the characters. It's just the circumstances which by they fell in love was bit if-fi & weak. But never the less, it's still a worthwhile movie. For some reason I enjoyed the sequel better than the original, both of which I watched back to back. In fact both movies were quite weak in the character's romance development. I think the original is overrated. It was very uneven. The original was very dark & horror with the ultra religious mother. Yet in other scenes it was light, comedy & even plain boring.

Neither film is scary but are good dramas about telekineses, what it means to be different, and bullies.  What I didn't like:  Amy Irving's presence was wasted.

I actually wanted to go see it in the theater when it got some not-too-bad reviews, but no-one would see it with me. The movie had its good and bad points.On the bad side, there were a couple of really unbelievable plot elements, like the fact that Sue Stern would take Rachel (I think that was her name) to the ruins of the old high school, that still happened to be standing like it had burned down a couple of weeks ago instead of over 20 years ago. I get that she had to explain things to her, but that was just stupid.  There's a killing thrown in towards the end that seems thrown in just to shock, and I'm surprised the actress agreed to it, not like she needs the money (if you saw it, you know who I mean). John Doe wasn't in it enough (and they made him look like crap. Yeah, I know his part wasn't that vital to the plot, so what?). They just flat out-steal techniques from the first one such as switching to slow-motion footage of her walking in front of the flames. They even toss in the old &quot;They're all gonna laugh at you...they're all gonna laugh at you...&quot; which just made me think of how I should dust off my copy of the original and watch it instead. If you've seen the first one, it's easy to tell where the plot of the movie is going.Of course, this movie being made at all was pretty unnecessary, the first one was a masterpiece. Obviously, it probably wouldn't have been made if there weren't the whole teen-horror craze going on that they wanted to cash in on. But, it could have been worse. It got the element that the first one had of high school being a really dangerous, vicious, and nasty place, and (if you are old enough) makes you REALLY glad that you are out of there. It had characters that you really cared about and wanted things to work out for.  It also had characters you really, really hated that you are hoping will get what's coming to them, in a really horrible way. It also had a really memorable, scary epilogue, that wasn't a total rip-off of the first one and was actually original (and sad). The original was about 50 times better, but at least this one doesn't insult your intelligence and has some decent characters with some depth to them, unlike most of the crap in the same teen-horror genre like say, Urban Legend or I Know What You Did Last Summer.

149287,A152C8GYY25HAH,0792842960,Matthew Horner,"[3, 7]","The Rage: Carrie 2 would be considered a dandy little horror flick, if it were not for the fact that it is a sequel to Carrie, a classic of this genre. It is a prime example of the pitfalls of trying to copy any movie that has attained cult status. Of course, if you haven't seen the original, the new movie should work for you. Your best bet is to watch this one first, then see the original.The Rage takes place twenty-plus years after the original Carrie wreaked havoc on most of the students in her high school. The new heroine with an attitude is called Rachael, and she is played rather well by Emily Bergl. Rachael is the quintessential movie character with a rotten childhood. Mom flips out and is thrown in a mental institution when Rachael is five or six years old. Fast forward to the present. Rachael is now a high school senior. She's been brought up by cold foster parents, who seem to be keeping her around for the money the state pays them. Girls in movies like this are allowed only one friend, who is usually female and always crazier than she is. Rachael's friend goes from girl on top of the world on a Monday morning to girl who jumps from the top of the school that afternoon. All of this serves merely as an excuse for Rachael's madness to be unleashed. As soon as she discovers that her friend's leap was caused by group of callous, rich, beautiful students, she goes to work. Like the original Carrie, this young woman has telekinesis, which is the ability to move objects. She moves them with a vengeance.Poor Amy Irving returns as Sue Small, who was student in the original movie. She tried to befriend Carrie. That attempt gave her a nervous breakdown, and now, as the school's principal, she has not learned her lesson. She does everything to help Rachael, including enlisting the aid of Rachael's insane mother. Sue doesn't really deserve to be principal of anything.Jason London tries hard as Jesse, the boy who falls in love with Rachael. I found his fate in the movie to be a bit bizarre, or at least less logical than what happened to the kid who fell for Carrie in the original.The music is properly eerie. The photography is decent. The dialog does little more than move the plot along. The special effects are quite good, but in comparison to those in Carrie, it's obviously true that less is often more.By the way, Carrie, which was directed by Brian De Palma, was the movie that originated the surprise double ending that all horror movies use to this day. Sue Small went to visit Carrie's grave. As she kneeled over it, a pale arm shot up from the ground and tried to pull her down into the earth. Young moviegoers can hardly imagine the impact that scene had. The audiences were literally screaming. In The Rage, there's a trick ending, but the only thing much of the audience screams for is for the movie to be over.I think one way to determine how a important movie is to you is to see how much of it you remember later on. In The Rage there are several flashbacks which are taken from Carrie. Each of these reminded me of how much better and more memorable the original was. They even caused my mind to recall other scenes. And that's the power of the movies in action.",2,Sequel only underscores greatness of the original,1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,3213,"['Rage', 'Carrie', '2', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'dandy', 'little', 'horror', 'flick', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'sequel', 'Carrie', 'classic', 'genre', 'prime', 'example', 'pitfalls', 'trying', 'copy', 'movie', 'attained', 'cult', 'status', 'course', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'new', 'movie', 'should', 'work', 'best', 'bet', 'watch', 'one', 'first', 'then', 'see', 'original.The', 'Rage', 'place', 'twenty-plus', 'years', 'original', 'Carrie', 'wreaked', 'havoc', 'most', 'students', 'high', 'school', 'new', 'heroine', 'attitude', 'called', 'Rachael', 'played', 'rather', 'well', 'Emily', 'Bergl', 'Rachael', 'quintessential', 'movie', 'character', 'rotten', 'childhood', 'Mom', 'out', 'thrown', 'mental', 'institution', 'when', 'Rachael', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'Fast', 'forward', 'present', 'Rachael', 'now', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'cold', 'foster', 'parents', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'keeping', 'around', 'money', 'state', 'Girls', 'movies', 'are', 'allowed', 'only', 'one', 'friend', 'who', 'usually', 'female', 'always', 'crazier', 'Rachael', 'friend', 'girl', 'top', 'world', 'Monday', 'morning', 'girl', 'who', 'jumps', 'top', 'school', 'afternoon', 'merely', 'excuse', 'Rachael', 'madness', 'be', 'unleashed', 'As', 'soon', 'friend', 'leap', 'was', 'caused', 'group', 'callous', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'students', 'work', 'original', 'Carrie', 'young', 'woman', 'telekinesis', 'ability', 'move', 'objects', 'vengeance.Poor', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'returns', 'Sue', 'Small', 'who', 'was', 'student', 'original', 'movie', 'tried', 'befriend', 'Carrie', 'attempt', 'gave', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'now', 'school', 'principal', 'not', 'learned', 'lesson', 'everything', 'help', 'Rachael', 'including', 'enlisting', 'aid', 'Rachael', 'insane', 'mother', 'Sue', ""n't"", 'really', 'deserve', 'be', 'principal', 'anything.Jason', 'London', 'hard', 'Jesse', 'boy', 'who', 'love', 'Rachael', 'found', 'fate', 'movie', 'be', 'bit', 'bizarre', 'least', 'less', 'logical', 'what', 'happened', 'kid', 'who', 'fell', 'Carrie', 'original.The', 'music', 'properly', 'eerie', 'photography', 'decent', 'dialog', 'little', 'more', 'move', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'comparison', 'Carrie', 'obviously', 'true', 'less', 'often', 'more.By', 'way', 'Carrie', 'was', 'directed', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'was', 'movie', 'originated', 'surprise', 'double', 'ending', 'horror', 'movies', 'use', 'day', 'Sue', 'Small', 'went', 'visit', 'Carrie', 'grave', 'kneeled', 'pale', 'arm', 'shot', 'up', 'ground', 'tried', 'pull', 'down', 'earth', 'moviegoers', 'can', 'hardly', 'imagine', 'impact', 'scene', 'had', 'audiences', 'were', 'literally', 'screaming', 'Rage', 'trick', 'ending', 'only', 'thing', 'much', 'audience', 'screams', 'movie', 'be', 'over.I', 'think', 'one', 'way', 'determine', 'how', 'important', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'remember', 'later', 'Rage', 'are', 'several', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'taken', 'Carrie', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'memorable', 'original', 'was', 'even', 'caused', 'mind', 'recall', 'other', 'scenes', 'power', 'movies', 'action']",N/A

In this movie, Carrie's father did not die, according to the hints Mom dropped in Carrie 1. He left Mom and went on to have another wife, spawning the main character of this movie, Rachel (Carrie's younger half-sister) who like Carrie comes to learn about her powers at a hard time in her life.I enjoyed this movie.

I've thought for a while that the front cover of this DVD was so cool, and I finally decided to buy it on DVD. The little insert inside has an even cooler front cover!!!This movie hit a chord with me, although none of my friends killed themselves over a guy, or got filmed having sex. But I recognised a few people in it - the loner, the jocks who aren't old enough to grow stubble, the popular girls ... So many.The film really starts when Mena Suvari's character kills herself, and this sets off a chain reaction of events. (Look out for Finch, if you want to see another American Pie character!) The thing I hated about that, is the prinicipal (played by Amy Irving, Sue Snell from the original - and she's so unrecognisable!) tells the school that there will be a moment's silence. Excuse me, someone's just committed suicide, don't you think the school should CLOSE?!When Rachel has a telekinetic episode, what is seen through her eyes is black & white, making you notice it more, and has a similar significance to the red in Sixth Sense.I thought Emily Bergl (Rachel) played the character brilliantly, and even had a certain quality about her - she totally reminded me of Sissy Spacek in the original. Someone's been studying the original! The way she moved, her eyes ...True, the original is a classic, and always will be considered a classic, but this matches it perfectly. I really enjoyed it. I think if you hadn't seen the original, it would still be good. The finale is better than the finale in the original (I NEED to get that on DVD next). Lots of people (mainly the guys, and anyone with glasses) will be wincing during the ending. The thorns seemingly growing over Rachel's body at the end is a very cool effect.The extras on the DVD were OK, the alternate ending didn't really make much sense, so you can see why they took it out. It's a pity some of the deleted scenes weren't kept in, some of them were brilliant!This film is a must-see.

149290,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,0792842960,Michael Butts,"[0, 1]","In CARRIE, Brian dePalma's classic, Carrie was the daughter of a very disturbed woman, and her torture by classmates came at times of innocence:  her first period, for instance.  Their cruelty was so intolerable because they didn't recognize the problems of this telekinetic young girl.  Then when at the prom, she finds out how they have deceived and humiliated her, her wrath is furious.In this well-made sequel, we meet Rachel, another telekinetic teen.  In this movie, though, Rachel's torture is more about the way she looks and who she associates with.  Rachel is rather pretty, intelligent, even if she is the daughter of a schizophrenic mother.  Yes, her classmates torment her to a point, but other than a nightly raid by the jocks, her main threat comes in the form of her jock boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.The finale in which Rachel gets her revenge is cataclysmic, and well staged.  What keeps this from being as effective as CARRIE is that Rachel's use of her telekinetic powers seems more vicious and deliberate, whereas Carrie's were more a result of the situations.Emily Bergl is marvelous as Rachel.  While not as overwhelming as Sissy Spacek, Bergl uses her doe eyes and warm smile to make us feel for her character.  Jason London (Jason and the Argonauts, Fall Time) gives one of his better performance as Jesse, the football jock, who takes a chance to get to know Rachel.  Amy Irving reprises her role as Sue from CARRIE, and her character is so poorly conceived, it's embarrasing to watch Amy try and make Sue credible.  Dylan Bruno and the rest of the jocks are good in their roles, giving their jock characters just the right amount of ego and menace.

But there where a lot of things I thought should have been explained better or fixed up.Of coarse this is a sequl to Carrie, sort of.... it's not exactly CARRIE PART 2.. this story is about Carrie Whites sister Rachel. Her father was Carries father and she has inhereted the same genes Carrie had, altho the movie does not explain that too well! If I hadnt have seen the original I wouldnt have even known that Rachel was supposed to have Telekineses, i probably would have thought she had ghosts haunting her.And the other thing I thought needed improvment was the ending, it should have been more drawn out, and maybe set up a bit better, it probbaly would have been a good idea to set up the fact that when Rachel gets angry she cant conseal it, and her tattoo probably should have boiled in previous parts of the movie and she almost goes off the deep end or something till she finally does... but apart from that, the sotry about Rachel loosing her best friend and why, and a bit on her life to the day she explodes in rage is a simmeler story to Carrie, but updated for modern day audiences, and titled part 2 to a classic horror flick.The bonus features are not worth checking out really, theres audio commentary if your interested, a few boring deleted scenes, and dont be fooled by the bit that says ALTERNETE ENDING, it's the end of the VERY LAST SCENE, I thought it was an alternate take to how Carrie died, or at least something from the party. But its the end-end bit thats slapped in there for no reason... in the movie it shows her boyfreind and her and she does something (you'll have to watch so I dont spoil it for ya) but in the alternate version they show what they original tried to do with CGI, but even the director said, ""it looks cool, but would not have made any sense"" ...

Since Carrie came out in the 70s, it was common practice in those days to strike while the iron was hot and make a sequel as soon as possible.  It didn't matter how cheesy or poor it was, as long as they kept name recognition in the audiences is what they thought brought in capital.  Maybe it did in video rental later, which is the only hope this movie had to be seen.  It made a statement, but it had been said before with Carrie.Carrie and her old high school have long since been dead and burried; but, curiously enough, Sue Snell is still around (played once again by Amy Irving) in the new high school's guidance office.  Here we have a new generation and new student body population.  So many things change, but just as many things stay the same.  It starts off shocking, when a girl jumps off the roof of the building, committing suicide.  The note she left indicated a terrible story.  It seems that the football team, in man's never ending virility quest, played a horrible prank on her.  As a hazing incident, a member of the team wined and dined her into parting with her virginity.  When he did so, he dropped her like a hot potato, added another notch onto his belt, and got a pat on the back from his fellow teammates.  And, being that she (we assume) was the innocent, feels horrified, embarrassed and ashamed that she was taken advantage of, she ended it.  From there, the story goes right into everything Carrie already said.Rachel is the outcast, but she doesn't seem as helpless and nervous as her predecesor was, so we like rather than pity her.  It so happens that she is the half sister of Carrie (they had the same father), and, surprise surprise, she inherrited the telekinetic powers.  She too will fall prey to football team's 10,000 Virgins Or Bust plot, but it just happens to be with the one nice guy who says he loves her when it's too late.  Under scenes of extreme stress she uses it.  Instead of the prom, she distroys everyone at a huge party.It did make me think, for an instant, about what things were like way back when.  Were we much more innocent back when Carrie was made?  If there were things like the football team's groupie mentality, I didn't know about them.  I'm sure kids were having just as much sex as they are now, but were these contests going on?  Maybe so.

149299,A363QRXP83K8ZE,0792842960,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[6, 8]","You know, this is a film that will be met with instant critical disdain to a certain degree, simply because it's a sequel made 23 years later.  The original ""Carrie"", if anything I've read is accurate, wasn't met with instant critical success.  But due to DePalma's growing reputation and developing career, it has taken on a cult status for sure.  And for good reason.I made sure to watch the original before viewing the sequel.  The original has a lot going for it, most notably in the style and thematic department.  However, I believe it lacks to some degree in character development, and the sequel actually succeeds at creating more believably motivated characters than the original.For instance, William Katt's character in the original, Tommy Ross, sporting the Sammy Hagar-esque mop, is a very ambiguous character.  The top jock who is also a straight-A student and with a popular girl, he doesn't get to do much for the film except show a nice smile.  He gets enlisted by his girlfriend Sue Snell (Amy Irving) to take wallflower Carrie to the prom in order to make up for the vicious hazing in the opening shower scene.  Tommy agrees, the administration finds out and thinks it's another joke, but the couple do it anyway.  It's never really clear through the script and character development just how much they really care about making it up to Carrie.  It's a gaping hole that could have been simply filled with some more dialogue or additional scenes of Snell's character.  Then, instead of offering resolution for Katt's character, he gets clonked on the head with a bucket and presumably dies on the prom couple stage.  Huh?The Rage, on the other hand, features a heroine who is less a victim than a tough survivor.  No wallflower is  she, like the pathetic Carrie of the original.  No insane religious overtones here, except for the opening.  Rachel, played with a very believable control by cutey Emily Bergl, is not beautiful or even stunningly cute like Sissy Spacek was.  The key to the original, in my mind, are those amazing eyes of Spacek's filmed in the red lens as she's covered with blood, during those split-screen, slo-mo shots of the revenege and the rampage.  That trance-like state during the murder sequence is CREEPY.The Rage features one heck of a revenge ending as well.  Don't underestimate.  People get it, but good.The effects are better than the original, they're graphic, and they're appropriate.  Talk about CD killing--this is better than Hellraiser III's CD slicing.  And one of the jocks gets a comeuppance involving a spear gun that's...well, appropriate, especially since he's played by the believably dimwitted Brad from TV's Home Improvement.  (Bit disappointed about the head jock's demise...though it was stylistically impressive, I mustsay.)Which brings me to the acting and the chemistry with these characters.  First off, they look more like high school kids than the original film portrayed.  They act like it, too.  Nancy Allen, Amy Irving, PJ Soles--they looked old in 1976, and the latter looked old in Halloween playing a cheerleader another 2 years later.Another treat--we get a returning cast member.  Always a BIG plus in my book when someone agrees to come back.  This time it's Sue Snell (Irving), now a guidance counselor at the rebuilt high school.  She has her own checkered past, including commitment to an asylum following the events of the original.  I was quite surprised by her fate in this film, that's for sure.  Gutsy.Perhaps one of the biggest notes on this film is the fact that, being a 90s horror remake, which everyone thinks will just be an excuse for wall-to-wall violence, or in this case, telekinesis non-stop, it's not.  Save for the very bloody end (appropriate--this is a revenge film, remember) the telekinetic power portion of the film is handled very well and controlled in terms of Rachel's acceptance.  In the original, the wallflower came out so quickly and was suddenly throwing her mother to the bed.I don't know.  I think this film got an automatic panning or a lackluster reaction for no good reason.  In its own right, it works well.  It's more about what's going on in American high schools everywhere today than it is about telekinetic powers, etc.  (Though we get more info on it than the original).So let's not be so quick to scoff at a film that's a sequel to a DePalma.  Take this for what it is: a good modern revenge film about the timeless cruelty of kids and the curveball of telekinetic powers.  I think director Katt Shea (who once was retrospected at MOMA) put more into this than most people think.Another point of recommendation--extras.  3 extra scenes are here which are interesting, as well as the original ending, which thank God they didn't use.

Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed both DePalma's version and the TV-remake, but I'm not looking forward to the current up coming remake. Having said that, this sequel continues with the re-invention of a used storyline. Certain parts were funny and over the top, plus you cared about Rachel, her mother, Sue Snell and Jesse.

149301,AER15RIMV8E6D,0792842960,Pumpkin Man,"[1, 1]","After the 2013 Carrie remake was released, I want to re-watch the original and its sequel. It had been years since I've watched this and it holds up and much better than I remembered. It has a great nostalgic vibe to it with having Amy Irving return as Sue Snell 23 years later and giving us some great flashback scenes from the original classic. It also brings the original story to the modern world with Carrie's half sister Rachel Lang having the telekinetic disease.This movie almost seems like it'd be a great Lifetime film rather than a sequel to Carrie because of the teenage drama and suicide over love. After Rachel's friend commits suicide because of being rejected by a jock, guidance counselor Sue Snell tries to help Rachel with the loss and soon the realization that she has powers.Rachel begins to fall in love with a sweet-hearted jock named Jesse. The jocks begin to taunt her and humiliate her at a party after the big football game. This is the best part of the film because you always wanna see how these hot telekinetic chicks get their revenge. There is one part that I absolutely hated. Even as a child, it brought me to tears. I won't spoil it for you, but someone beloved gets caught in the crossfire. It's a good and decent sequel but will never beat the original.

Carrie White DIED at the end of the film ""Carrie"", so I have to wonder how in the h*ll can there be a sequel?!?! Anyways, I finally let my morbid curiosity get the better of me when I came across a copy of this on VHS a few years ago for only $3.When someone goes to Hell in a burning house in the first film, that ought to be pretty sequel-proof, don't you think? And you'd think Amy Irving (whose character is the lone survivor in the first picture's slaughter finale) would run screaming from a follow-up. But no, we have to go through the Carrie Thing again, with Irving playing a school guidance counselor and Emily Bergl playing Rachel, a Different Kind of Girl with the ability to send coffee cups flying. Only reason to watch this: the grisly reward Irving receives for being in this picture.""Carrie"" was genius. This is trash! No Sissy Spacek. No Brian De Palma. No Piper Laurie. No ""They're all gonna laugh at you!"". No characters called Carrie. No soul. No pulse. No point. As generic in every aspect as Brian De Palma's original was inventive.How dare someone give this piece of garbage 5 stars???!! I believe that everyone has the right to their own opinions, but the prints to this film should have been burned by the studios before it got released on the unsuspecting public. This is considered one of the all-time worst films ever. But, if people like it, more power to them, but don't ever question MY taste in films just because I don't.As for ""The Rage"" (I refuse to acknowledge this garbage as ""Carrie 2""), even Stephen King hated this trash so bad that he remade his novel ""Carrie"" so people could have a modern day version of the Carrie story. However, ""The Rage"" had NOTHING whatsoever to do with De Palma's classic horror film ""Carrie""! I know, they wrote that Rachel is Carrie's half sister, but how lame. That was also done in ""Halloween 2"", another useless sequel.The current edition uses the original as a blueprint, but leaves out all the wit, sympathy and bravado. Though ideas and scenes are shamelessly recycled from ""Carrie"" and other horror pics - including gratuitous inserting of some 1976 clips - ""The Rage"" seems hellbent on diluting every exploitable aspect.Maybe there's a real use for this film after all. Stand it up against the original, and you have a pretty good lesson in what's happened to the movies in the last couple of decades.This simply repeats the story without extending it; it's little more than ""Carrie"" without the embarrassing '70s threads and puffy hair, and with some ""hey dude"" updating of the teen dialogue. It's also ""Carrie"" without the skill, intensity or excitement of the original. It's a prime example of the pointless remake, adding nothing substantial and only making its predecessor look even better.Even among the misguided, unethical, numskull ranks of so many, many film producers, it's hard to believe anyone had the idea to revisit Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"", which enjoyed a certain perverse perfection and narrative completion.""The Rage"" is the kind of film that gets unintentional laughs. They happen when Sue takes Rachel to the site of the burned-out old high school, where nobody has even cleaned up the rubble after 20 years, and every time there's a flashback to the original movie, mostly showing Sissy Spacek covered in blood. Yes, the central character visits the scorched wreckage of the old high school, which, for no discernible reason, has been allowed to stand for 20-odd years. Of the many clumsy sequences in ""The Rage: Carrie 2"", this one was one of the lamest.The original ""Carrie"" helped launch both Stephen King and Brian De Palma into their respective big leagues and kicked off the whole gutted teen genre. Unlike the truckload of horror flicks that followed it, ""Carrie"" didn't rely on knife-wielding bad boys in scary masks for its frights, but on a gawky little slip of a girl - which was, in lots of ways, much scarier.What makes a movie like ""The Rage"" difficult to pull off is that it's entirely lacking in suspense. The bad kids may pull their cruel stunts, but we all know that once they really piss her off, their puny spear guns will be no match for Rachel's Incredible Hulk anger-management style. Because the movie's all about bad coping skills, Rachel can't let her anger leak out a little at a time - she's got to grit her teeth until she finally, cataclysmically, loses her cool. What this means is that most of the action takes place in the last few minutes, as bodies are impaled, castrated, decapitated, drowned and creatively dispatched via flying CDs in such rapid succession it's hard to tell what's going on in all the grisly mayhem. All that's certain is that it's really gross and it's over really fast. Before then, and for a huge chunk of the film, ""Rage"" actually bears no resemblance to ""Carrie"" whatsoever!

149304,A3BAOIC7JMCY6R,0792842960,"RPK ""Professional Shark Tamer""","[0, 3]","The Rage: Carrie 2 could have been something REALLY special...but, it fell completely flat for me. I actually saw this my junior year of high school and that is the only reason I am giving it 2 stars...for the mere fact that it brings back memories of good times, hanging out with friends and enjoying a cheesy flick together. However, seeing this movie was almost painful for me. I was SUCH a fan of Carrie when I was younger. It was such an interesting way to approach an outcast, taunted girl who happens to have telekentic powers. In the original, Carrie was a completely sympathetic character. She was a meek, abused, shy girl who was visibly terrified of people. You instantly felt sorry for her and in that final prom scene, you may have even rooted as she went on her revenge-based massacre, essentially wiping out her whole senior class.In The Rage, the new Carrie is a character named Rachel, who *gasp!* has the same father as the original Carrie and has also inherited telekinetic abilities. Rachel is also an outcast and somewhat friendless character. She's actually a lot DIFFERENT then Carrie though. She is gutsy and brazzen. She speaks her mind and has a dark sense of humor. She is FAR more broody and unlikeable then Carrie was. Of course, as a viewer, you find yourself rooting for Rachel as the movie moves on...You don't want the jocks and mean kids tormenting her.The main issue for me, was the finale. I wish there had been more carnage. Not to sound like a gore-freak and not to insinuate that there is no gore in this film-there are some gross moments...but, I wanted Rachel to have a little more kill-time in her final moments. Carrie's ending was great...but Rachel's was SO-SO. Another big nuisance with this movie were the random black and white moments. I mean, come on...everytime Rachel had a telekenetic moment or things got hectic the film would snap in and out of black and white film. Kind of amateur if you ask me.Also, I have to agree with other reviewers who complained about Amy Irving's character being plunged back into this world only to be brutally knocked off for no apparent reason. She was such a monumental part of Carrie and it was almost insulting to throw her in this and have her impaled viciously when she was just a good woman, trying to save a troubled girl. I think they were just trying to pay homage to the original Carrie, where her friendly Coach is killed by the bleachers. Not really sure....it just didn't work for me and made me angry that they decided to knock off the Sue Snell character.Overall, not really the best movie.

149309,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,0792842960,The Groove,"[4, 7]","Brian DePalma's 1976 ""Carrie"" was a horror classic that vividly illustrated a schoolgirl's fury when pushed over the edge. Based on the 1974 Stephen King novel, it lingered in my system for many weeks like a bad hangover. In the two decades since its release, I doubt there was an overwhelming demand for a sequel, but we got it anyway. This film, which picks up the ending of the original 23 years later, was howlingly stupid. It essentially repeats the very same storyline of its predecessor, but without DePalma's magic touch, chills, suspense, or dramatic tension. Emily Bergyl is Rachel, an alienated teen who is Carrie White's sister and shares her telekenetic powers. But unlike Carrie, Rachel has a social life and is assertive enough to stand up to her catty classmates. At the assistance of guidance counselor Sue Snell (Amy Irving), the only survivor from the original movie, Rachel learns about her past as well as her ""gift,"" which is used to get revenege on classmates who pull a prank on her. I won't reveal spoilers, but ""The Rage"" is one of the silliest movies I've seen. It's predictable, crippled by some bad dialogue, and the only scary scenes are the ones that flash back to Sissy Spacek who played Carrie White in the original. Being such a fan of ""Carrie,"" my curiosity was so intense that I had to see the sequel. But even with my low expectations, it ended up being a bust. What's more interesting is that it's being marketed to an audience that probably wasn't even born when the 1976 flick was released. The younger crowd will definitely call ""The Rage"" cheesy while the older folks who saw the original will no doubt be disappointed. Across the board, ""The Rage"" is an utter disaster.",1,"""Carrie""-d Away by Stupidity.",1040774400,"12 25, 2002",2002,1712,"['Brian', 'DePalma', '1976', 'Carrie', 'was', 'horror', 'classic', 'vividly', 'illustrated', 'schoolgirl', 'fury', 'when', 'pushed', 'edge', 'Based', '1974', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'lingered', 'system', 'many', 'weeks', 'bad', 'hangover', 'two', 'decades', 'release', 'doubt', 'was', 'overwhelming', 'demand', 'sequel', 'got', 'anyway', 'film', 'up', 'ending', 'original', '23', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'howlingly', 'stupid', 'essentially', 'very', 'same', 'storyline', 'predecessor', 'DePalma', 'magic', 'touch', 'chills', 'suspense', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Emily', 'Bergyl', 'Rachel', 'alienated', 'teen', 'who', 'Carrie', 'White', 'sister', 'shares', 'telekenetic', 'powers', 'Carrie', 'Rachel', 'social', 'life', 'assertive', 'enough', 'stand', 'up', 'catty', 'classmates', 'assistance', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'Sue', 'Snell', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'only', 'survivor', 'original', 'movie', 'Rachel', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'gift', 'used', 'get', 'revenege', 'classmates', 'who', 'pull', 'prank', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'spoilers', 'Rage', 'one', 'silliest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'predictable', 'crippled', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'only', 'scary', 'scenes', 'are', 'ones', 'flash', 'back', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'who', 'played', 'Carrie', 'White', 'original', 'Being', 'such', 'fan', 'Carrie', 'curiosity', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'had', 'see', 'sequel', 'even', 'low', 'expectations', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'bust', 'What', 'more', 'interesting', 'being', 'marketed', 'audience', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'born', 'when', '1976', 'flick', 'was', 'released', 'younger', 'crowd', 'will', 'definitely', 'call', 'Rage', 'cheesy', 'older', 'folks', 'who', 'saw', 'original', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'disappointed', 'board', 'Rage', 'utter', 'disaster']",N/A

149311,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0792842960,Wuchak,"[10, 12]","""The Rage"" is a serious high school drama that includes the sub-theme of telekinesis and ends in utter, tragic horror.The basic plot is the same as Stephen King's original, albeit with a stronger person as the title character. Hence, ""The Rage"" is essentially a more-modern remake as much as a sequel. In fact, it's not even necessary to see the original to appreciate it.THE PLOT: A social outcast in high school slowly becomes aware that she has telekinetic abilities. These powers are unleashed with lethal fury when the popular kids pull a meanspirited prank on her.WHAT WORKS: I'm glad ""The Rage"" doesn't have the creepy Pharisaical mother like in the original. This is one aspect that I couldn't stand about ""Carrie."" It (sort of) gave the impression that anyone who takes the teachings of Christianity seriously will become a warped, hideous, deathly, abusive killjoy like Carrie's mother. Actually, although there are indeed modern-day Pharisees in Christendom, nothing could be further from the truth. Authentic Christianity gives liberty, life and joy, not the opposite (see, for example, John 8:31-32, John 10:10 and 1 Peter 1:8). Don't take me wrong here, I'm not preachin' to you.Emily Bergl plays Carrie's half-sister Rachel and she does it well. She's an outcast like Carrie but she's stronger, more confident and doesn't have a dream to fit in with the popular kids. One of the film's themes is: Does love really exist? Rachel says she doesn't believe in love. Her mother's in a mental institution. She's a foster child and her foster parents clearly only have her for the extra money, not because they love her.Any teenager or adult can readily relate to the situations/issues addressed in the film:- The common cliques: the ""popular"" crowd, oversexed jocks, snooty cheerleaders, rich kids and their parents, nerds, outcasts, etc.- Pre-mature sexual experience and the resulting emotional turmoil.- Suicide.- the spiritual emptiness of casual sex.- First love, true love.- Being attracted to or dating someone outside your social stratum.- Football, players, fandom and hardcore coaching antics.- Friendship, rivalry, fights.- Partying.""The Rage"" effectively brings to life these joys and horrors of the high school experience.Jesse, played by Jason London is an interesting character. Jesse is truly attracted to Rachel, but why? It's not that she's conventionally beautiful like his ex-girlfriend, although she's not ugly either. Perhaps Jesse sees the superficiality and conformity of the spoiled ""popular kids"" clique and veers toward someone more humble, loving and genuine, like Rachel. Also observe that Jesse isn't a conformist, even though he's technically part of the popular kids clique: Because of his love for an outcast he fearlessly stands up to the most popular (arrogant) jock; everyone on the team gets his head shaved except Jesse, etc.It's interesting to note that, although Rachel is portrayed as a misfit who likes Marilyn Manson, she's not a rebellious, disrespectful teenager. She never ""answers back"" her foster 'father,' she works, she isn't promiscuous and isn't a party monger.Furthermore, ""The Rage"" is respectful of its source. It even brings back the lone survivor of the original, Sue Snell (Amy Irving), as a school counselor.Also, the credits features the excellent song ""Crazy Little Voices"" by the Egyptian band Ra, which isn't available on their proper albums.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: There's a love scene that's premature IMHO, but it can be defended on the grounds that time has to be condensed in a movie.I just saw the original ""Carrie"" and ""The Rage"" back-to-back and I liked the latter better with the exception of the original's prom scene, which is iconic with the blood-splattered Sissy and the fire in the background. Plus, the '76 version is the original version and it gets points just for that whereas ""Carrie 2"" loses points for just being another take on the same basic plot. I suppose you could also argue that the original has better mood, which it does.Yet I prefer the sequel because Rachel is a much more interesting character than Carrie in the original film and Jesse is really attracted to Rachel -- even loves her -- rather than Tommy just doing his girlfriend a favor and feeling sorry for Carrie in the original.Also, the thin plot of the original is clearly padded -- unimportant scenes are drawn-out to about twice the length they need to be -- and this makes the movie seem long at 98 minutes and some parts boring. ""The Rage,"" by contrast, runs 104 minutes but it doesn't seem as long (or boring) as the original because the story and characters are more interesting and the film isn't padded.FINAL ANALYSIS: I encourage you to be openminded and allow yourself to enjoy a different take on the same basic plot of ""Carrie."" Both films have their strengths. In some ways ""The Rage"" is better than ""Carrie."" It's definitely not a weak or campy sequel; rather it's a strong late-90s updating and effectively showcases the joys and horrors of the high school years.The film was shot in Dallas & Charlotte, NC, and runs 104 minutes.GRADE: A",5,The Joys and HORROR of the High School Experience,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,5112,"['Rage', 'serious', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'sub-theme', 'telekinesis',
