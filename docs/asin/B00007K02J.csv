All the actors were great but Blair Underwood stole the screen. His transition from nice to ""bad"" was so believable. His decent to madness was worth watching. It was very suspenseful and made you want to know how it ended. It shows what can almost happen in real life when someone loses a loved one and feels betrayed by a friend. When death occurs, many people need someone to blame and this movie definitely shows the effects of anger, betrayal, hurt, seduction and innocence all wrapped in one.  It ""almost"" makes you feel sorry for the bad guy(Blair) for a moment.

730056,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B00007K02J,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 0]","I always knew Blair was a good actor but he really shined in this role. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It comes off as a low budget made-for-BET movie at first but it went way past expectations. I wouldn't say this is a great movie but it keeps you entertained because of Underwood.Debbie Morgan was a delight as well and knowing her from television work and as AMC's Angie, I was surprised to see her in a film like this. I never thought of her as acting in something like this and it was refreshing to see her in this role.Michael Beach was completely out shined. His role wasn't memorable or convincing at all. He was jealous when he shouldn't have been yet dumb and blind to what is going on around him. He had no commonsense and his character could've been written with more depth. I've seen Beach in a lot of movies and to me he tends to overact sometimes and he seemed off the mark with this role. He didn't seem comfortable with the dialogue and his scenes seemed forced. He had zero chemistry with Morgan while she and Underwood oozed so much sexual chemistry it oozed off the screen.I think the film was too short and more could've been done. Some scenes were unnecessary and pointless. At times it was like the film was pieced together in the wrong spots. But Underwood was mesmerizing and looking forward to him in each scene was the only thing that kept me watching.I applaud Tim Reid for trying to give us a black Fatal Attraction but it wasn't without issues. We should've known more background about Chance (Underwood) and why he acts the way he acts. We're led to believe he snaps when his wife and unborn child dies, but then Michael (Beach) shares with Lauren (Morgan) that Chance always had a dark side. Which is it? Did he snap or was he always a nut? You can't have it both ways.The production had some issues as well. The film comes off cheap and probably because it was. But just because a movie is cheap doesn't mean it has to look like it. The setting and the annoying saxophone music in the background reminded me of some 1970's porn flick. The outside shots were nice but there were major lighting issues in a lot of scenes with Blair in his place that made the film look cheap.Morgan's character seemed strong but she did have some brain fart moments going on. Chance stalked her constantly before she even thought of calling the police. And since she wanted him to leave her alone so badly it was hard for me to believe she'd continue to keep her and Chance's affair a secret knowing if she told it could free her from him. But she wasn't the only one acting dumb. Even after Michael is beaten by a crazed Chance and even knows Chance is nuts he still allows him to stay with him and his wife. In what world would that happen? So yes, some things didn't make sense.With some fine-tuning, a few more dollars for production, some tweaking on the writing and better development for Beach's character, this could've been a five star film. The acting is not bad at all, even Beach's though he could've been better. So the movie does have it's interesting points but also some ridiculous ones.",3,Blair Rocks!,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,3147,"['always', 'knew', 'Blair', 'was', 'good', 'actor', 'really', 'shined', 'role', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'off', 'low', 'budget', 'made-for-BET', 'movie', 'first', 'went', 'way', 'expectations', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'great', 'movie', 'entertained', 'Underwood.Debbie', 'Morgan', 'was', 'delight', 'as', 'well', 'knowing', 'television', 'work', 'AMC', 'Angie', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'film', 'never', 'thought', 'acting', 'something', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'role.Michael', 'Beach', 'was', 'completely', 'out', 'shined', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'convincing', 'was', 'jealous', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'yet', 'dumb', 'blind', 'what', 'going', 'had', 'commonsense', 'character', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'written', 'more', 'depth', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Beach', 'lot', 'movies', 'overact', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'off', 'mark', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'comfortable', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'forced', 'had', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'Morgan', 'Underwood', 'oozed', 'so', 'much', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'oozed', 'off', 'screen.I', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'more', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'scenes', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'pointless', 'times', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'pieced', 'together', 'wrong', 'spots', 'Underwood', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'looking', 'forward', 'scene', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'watching.I', 'applaud', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'trying', 'give', 'black', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'was', ""n't"", 'issues', 'should', ""'ve"", 'known', 'more', 'background', 'Chance', 'Underwood', 'why', 'way', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'when', 'wife', 'unborn', 'child', 'dies', 'then', 'Michael', 'Beach', 'shares', 'Lauren', 'Morgan', 'Chance', 'always', 'had', 'dark', 'side', 'Did', 'snap', 'was', 'always', 'nut', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ways.The', 'production', 'had', 'issues', 'well', 'film', 'cheap', 'probably', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'cheap', ""n't"", 'mean', 'look', 'setting', 'annoying', 'saxophone', 'music', 'background', 'reminded', '1970', 'porn', 'flick', 'outside', 'shots', 'were', 'nice', 'were', 'major', 'lighting', 'issues', 'lot', 'scenes', 'Blair', 'place', 'made', 'film', 'look', 'cheap.Morgan', 'character', 'seemed', 'strong', 'did', 'have', 'brain', 'fart', 'moments', 'going', 'Chance', 'stalked', 'constantly', 'even', 'thought', 'calling', 'police', 'wanted', 'leave', 'alone', 'so', 'badly', 'was', 'hard', 'believe', ""'d"", 'continue', 'keep', 'Chance', 'affair', 'secret', 'knowing', 'told', 'could', 'free', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'acting', 'dumb', 'Even', 'Michael', 'beaten', 'crazed', 'Chance', 'even', 'knows', 'Chance', 'nuts', 'still', 'stay', 'wife', 'what', 'world', 'would', 'happen', 'So', 'yes', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.With', 'fine-tuning', 'few', 'more', 'dollars', 'production', 'tweaking', 'writing', 'better', 'development', 'Beach', 'character', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'even', 'Beach', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'have', 'interesting', 'points', 'also', 'ridiculous', 'ones']",Asunder

A line he says ''It wont stop the pain.....'' or something like that broke my heart to the core. Cant imagine losing a loved one...let alone a SPOUSE in death. I thought it ended too soon and I wish we got to see pre trauma Chance more than the movie showed,for us to gain sympathy for this troubled guy.
