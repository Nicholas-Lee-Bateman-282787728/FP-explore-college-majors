1043837,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000M69OW2,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Charlie Chan: At the Opera, 1936 filmIt was a rainy night outside the sanatorium. One inmate sings opera and plays the piano; an amnesia victim who is unknown. A newspaper brings back a memory, so he overpowers the guard and escapes. The police search for this madman. Charlie Chan is called in to help, and shows his powers of observation. Opera singer Lilli Rochelle asks for police protection, she received a threat with her flowers. [There are funny comments sprinkled among the dialogue.] Back at the opera the madman remembers his name; he used to be a singer. Madame Rochelle has a jealous husband, and he threatens baritone Borelli. There is a mystery within the opera. The police chase Borelli, but he is found dead inside a locked room. Chan notices the blood is drying, there must have been a double on stage. The search finds Lilli but she is stabbed dead too! Then we learn more about Lilli's secret past.Chan finds an old newspaper clipping and seeks an old photograph. We see the latest technology that sends a picture thousands of miles in minutes, facsimile transmission. Chan shows his wisdom and judgment, he makes no assumptions about the facts in this case. [Did you make an assumption about the guilty party before the ending?] The aria in the opera is repeated, then a shot rings out. Chan explains why the obvious suspect was innocent, and then reveals the real murderer! He then asks a favor of a young woman to save another life. There is a happy ending, and Chan can return to Honolulu on time.This is another example where love or money leads to murder. Uncovering hidden facts leads to a solution. It is one of the better films in the series because of its higher production values.",5,Drama at the Opera,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,1711,"['Charlie', 'Chan', 'Opera', '1936', 'filmIt', 'was', 'rainy', 'night', 'sanatorium', 'One', 'inmate', 'sings', 'opera', 'piano', 'amnesia', 'victim', 'who', 'unknown', 'newspaper', 'back', 'memory', 'guard', 'escapes', 'police', 'search', 'madman', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'called', 'help', 'powers', 'observation', 'Opera', 'singer', 'Lilli', 'Rochelle', 'police', 'protection', 'received', 'threat', 'flowers', '[', 'are', 'funny', 'comments', 'sprinkled', 'dialogue', ']', 'Back', 'opera', 'madman', 'name', 'used', 'be', 'singer', 'Madame', 'Rochelle', 'jealous', 'husband', 'baritone', 'Borelli', 'mystery', 'opera', 'police', 'chase', 'Borelli', 'found', 'dead', 'locked', 'room', 'Chan', 'blood', 'drying', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'double', 'stage', 'search', 'Lilli', 'stabbed', 'dead', 'too', 'Then', 'learn', 'more', 'Lilli', 'secret', 'past.Chan', 'old', 'newspaper', 'clipping', 'old', 'photograph', 'see', 'latest', 'technology', 'picture', 'thousands', 'miles', 'minutes', 'facsimile', 'transmission', 'Chan', 'wisdom', 'judgment', 'assumptions', 'facts', 'case', '[', 'Did', 'make', 'assumption', 'guilty', 'party', 'ending', ']', 'aria', 'opera', 'repeated', 'then', 'shot', 'out', 'Chan', 'why', 'obvious', 'suspect', 'was', 'innocent', 'then', 'real', 'murderer', 'then', 'favor', 'young', 'woman', 'save', 'life', 'happy', 'ending', 'Chan', 'can', 'return', 'Honolulu', 'time.This', 'example', 'where', 'love', 'money', 'leads', 'murder', 'Uncovering', 'hidden', 'facts', 'solution', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'series', 'higher', 'production', 'values']",Charlie Chan At The Opera
1043838,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000M69OW2,Bobby Underwood,"[1, 1]","Charlie Chan vs. Boris Karloff is how this one is billed in the opening credits, but it is actually a tight little mystery with an opera setting that most Chan fans consider one of the best in the franchise. H. Bruce Humberstone returned as director while Scott Darling and Charles S. Belden adapted Fox's followup to Charlie Chan at the Race Track from a Bess Meredyth story. Thomas Beck made his final appearance in a Chan film here, having had parts in three of the Warner Oland films at Fox. He would be among the cast in two Mr. Moto entries as well. Those who remember William Demarest from My Three Sons on television will have a good time watching him here as a none too bright copper who can't keep up with the sharp mind of our most honorable Chinese detective from Hawaii.A dark and rainy night at Rockland Sanitarium finds Boris Karloff playing the piano as he has every night for the past seven years. He has been unable to remember his name or past and is believed mad. Upon seeing a newspaper with a picture of Lilli Rochelle (Margaret Irving) this stormy night, however, he remembers being Gravelle, a great opera singer who supposedly burned up in a fire. He also remembers it was no accident, and the manhunt begins. Charlie is asked to assist in the hunt by the police, and son Lee (Keye Luke) forgets his romantic plans to help pop. As usual, Lee's help provides some humor, but also some clues. Lee dresses as a knight with his college pals and prowls the dark passageways beneath the opera house for clues at one point.Gravelle wants revenge and soon the two leads are murdered, while the manhunt continues. Chan discovers marital jealousy present at the opera also, however, which points to other possible motives, and suspects other than Gravelle. Kitty (Charlotte Henry) and Phil (Thomas Beck) are a nice young couple seeking to meet with Rochelle on opening night and she proves to have a connection with the madman. Karloff is quite good here, never seeming over the top. A good cast and fun setting for Oland and Luke make this one a topflight entry in the Charlie Chan series.",5,Charlie vs. Boris,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2105,"['Charlie', 'Chan', 'vs.', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'how', 'one', 'billed', 'opening', 'credits', 'actually', 'tight', 'little', 'mystery', 'opera', 'setting', 'most', 'Chan', 'fans', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'franchise', 'H.', 'Bruce', 'Humberstone', 'returned', 'director', 'Scott', 'Darling', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Belden', 'adapted', 'Fox', 'followup', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'Race', 'Track', 'Bess', 'Meredyth', 'story', 'Thomas', 'Beck', 'made', 'final', 'appearance', 'Chan', 'film', 'here', 'having', 'had', 'parts', 'three', 'Warner', 'Oland', 'films', 'Fox', 'would', 'be', 'cast', 'two', 'Mr.', 'Moto', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'remember', 'William', 'Demarest', 'My', 'Three', 'Sons', 'television', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'here', 'none', 'too', 'bright', 'copper', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'sharp', 'mind', 'most', 'honorable', 'Chinese', 'detective', 'Hawaii.A', 'dark', 'rainy', 'night', 'Rockland', 'Sanitarium', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'playing', 'piano', 'night', 'past', 'seven', 'years', 'been', 'unable', 'remember', 'name', 'past', 'believed', 'mad', 'seeing', 'newspaper', 'picture', 'Lilli', 'Rochelle', 'Margaret', 'Irving', 'stormy', 'night', 'however', 'being', 'Gravelle', 'great', 'opera', 'singer', 'who', 'supposedly', 'burned', 'up', 'fire', 'also', 'was', 'accident', 'manhunt', 'Charlie', 'asked', 'assist', 'hunt', 'police', 'son', 'Lee', 'Keye', 'Luke', 'romantic', 'plans', 'help', 'pop', 'usual', 'Lee', 'help', 'humor', 'also', 'clues', 'Lee', 'knight', 'college', 'pals', 'dark', 'opera', 'house', 'clues', 'one', 'point.Gravelle', 'revenge', 'soon', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'murdered', 'manhunt', 'Chan', 'marital', 'jealousy', 'present', 'opera', 'also', 'however', 'other', 'possible', 'motives', 'other', 'Gravelle', 'Kitty', 'Charlotte', 'Henry', 'Phil', 'Thomas', 'Beck', 'are', 'nice', 'young', 'couple', 'seeking', 'meet', 'Rochelle', 'opening', 'night', 'have', 'connection', 'madman', 'Karloff', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'never', 'seeming', 'top', 'good', 'cast', 'fun', 'setting', 'Oland', 'Luke', 'make', 'one', 'topflight', 'entry', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'series']",Charlie Chan At The Opera
1043839,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,B000M69OW2,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""","[1, 1]","In Charlie Chan at the Opera, you'll see a combination of Phantom of the Opera and the Hunchback of Notre Dame displayed as a Charlie Chan mystery steeped in fine acting and good atmosphere.  As the movie opens, an unidentified amnesia patient (Boris Karloff) is compulsively playing the piano while singing opera at a sanitarium.  An attendant annoys him by interrupting, but offers the evening newspaper as solace.  The photograph of an opera singer, Lilli Rochelle (Margaret Irving), enrages the patient who knocks the attendant out and takes off wearing the attendant's uniform.Later, Charlie Chan stops by to say good-bye to Inspector Regan before leaving on the night boat to Honolulu.  While there, Charlie ruffles Sergeant Kelly's feathers with deductions about the problems the police are having in finding the amnesia patient.  They are interrupted by Lilli Rochelle who drops in to report a death threat tied to that night's performance.  Charlie and the police agree to attend that performance to keep her safe.At the opera, it becomes clear that Lilli has been seeing her baritone, Enrico Barelli, much to the annoyance of Madame Barelli and Lilli's husband, Mr. Whitely.  All of that turmoil is interrupted when the amnesia patient shows up in Madame Barelli's dressing room, and she identifies him as Gravelle, a baritone who had ""died"" in an opera house fire.  Gravelle claims that someone locked in his dressing room, but he escaped anyway and is just recovering his memory.As the plot goes on, dead bodies begin to pile up and the police are at a loss to track down the unauthorized people who are wandering through the opera house.A lot of the appeal of this film comes from the fine acting performances by Boris Karloff and Warner Oland who are supported well with some very funny scenes and gags by William Demarest as Sergeant Kelly and Keye Luke as Charlie's oldest son.  Charlie also shows himself to be advanced scientifically as he brings up finger prints with acid and arranges for a newspaper to send a photograph by the equivalent of a fax in the 1930s.The film is fast moving.  It has to be.  Charlie wants to make that night boat back to Honolulu so he can see the rest of his family again.The ""Chinese"" sayings of Charlie Chan also provide lots of humor.  Here is my favorite from the film:  ""Luck -- happy combination of small accidents"" which is offered by Charlie as a face-saving explanation why Sergeant Kelly wasn't able to figure out what was going on.",4,"Rich in Acting, Weak on Mystery",1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,2491,"['Charlie', 'Chan', 'Opera', ""'ll"", 'see', 'combination', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'displayed', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'mystery', 'steeped', 'fine', 'acting', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'unidentified', 'amnesia', 'patient', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'compulsively', 'playing', 'piano', 'singing', 'opera', 'sanitarium', 'attendant', 'interrupting', 'evening', 'newspaper', 'solace', 'photograph', 'opera', 'singer', 'Lilli', 'Rochelle', 'Margaret', 'Irving', 'patient', 'who', 'attendant', 'off', 'wearing', 'attendant', 'uniform.Later', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'say', 'good-bye', 'Inspector', 'Regan', 'leaving', 'night', 'boat', 'Honolulu', 'there', 'Charlie', 'Sergeant', 'Kelly', 'feathers', 'deductions', 'problems', 'police', 'are', 'having', 'finding', 'amnesia', 'patient', 'are', 'interrupted', 'Lilli', 'Rochelle', 'who', 'report', 'death', 'threat', 'tied', 'night', 'performance', 'Charlie', 'police', 'agree', 'attend', 'performance', 'keep', 'safe.At', 'opera', 'clear', 'Lilli', 'been', 'seeing', 'baritone', 'Enrico', 'Barelli', 'much', 'annoyance', 'Madame', 'Barelli', 'Lilli', 'husband', 'Mr.', 'Whitely', 'turmoil', 'interrupted', 'when', 'amnesia', 'patient', 'up', 'Madame', 'Barelli', 'dressing', 'room', 'Gravelle', 'baritone', 'who', 'had', 'died', 'opera', 'house', 'fire', 'Gravelle', 'someone', 'locked', 'dressing', 'room', 'escaped', 'anyway', 'just', 'recovering', 'memory.As', 'plot', 'dead', 'bodies', 'begin', 'pile', 'up', 'police', 'are', 'loss', 'track', 'down', 'unauthorized', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'wandering', 'opera', 'house.A', 'lot', 'appeal', 'film', 'fine', 'acting', 'performances', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'Warner', 'Oland', 'who', 'are', 'supported', 'well', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'gags', 'William', 'Demarest', 'Sergeant', 'Kelly', 'Keye', 'Luke', 'Charlie', 'oldest', 'son', 'Charlie', 'also', 'be', 'advanced', 'scientifically', 'up', 'finger', 'prints', 'acid', 'arranges', 'newspaper', 'send', 'photograph', 'equivalent', 'fax', '1930s.The', 'film', 'fast', 'moving', 'be', 'Charlie', 'make', 'night', 'boat', 'back', 'Honolulu', 'can', 'see', 'rest', 'family', 'Chinese', 'sayings', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'also', 'provide', 'lots', 'humor', 'Here', 'favorite', 'film', 'Luck', 'happy', 'combination', 'small', 'accidents', 'offered', 'Charlie', 'face-saving', 'explanation', 'why', 'Sergeant', 'Kelly', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going']",Charlie Chan At The Opera

Acting is fine and fast paced.It,s fun to see Boris Karloff in this one. He is insanitarium and has no idea who he is. We can hear himsinging in beautiful baritone. One day he sees a newspaperand a picture of a beautiful opera singer on it andinstantly becomes furious. Now he has realized who he is.He escapes and is trying to find this singer and goes toan opera in the city and hears her sing. He knocks out thebaritone who is singing with her and assumes his disguiseand goes on without the soprano guessing it is her exhusband; she gradually realizes it as he continues to singin a much more beautiful baritone than the true one..asshe sings, she becomes more and more frightened and whenhe is supposed to kill her, she screams and drops in adead faint but shortly they realize she is dead.Boris Karloff is immediately jailed. Charlie and#2 son feel he is not the guilty oneand set out to proveit.
