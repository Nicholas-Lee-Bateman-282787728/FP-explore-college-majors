It was good. Not as good as I had hoped it would be, but as far as revenge stories goes, it's up there with the best.Yes the film is violent. Very much so. But then, this is a film driven to absolute hatred and rage. Why should you expect him to be nice and non-violent. This is a story about what death dealing is really about. It's not about cartoon violence as found in Kill Bill. It's not about, ""hey you looked at me funny so now I gotta beat you up."" It's about, ""for what you mutha [bleepers] have done, I'm gonna butcher every last [bleeping] one of you!"" This movie is about what could bring a man to that point and what he would do afterwards.Creasy (Denzel Washington) is not a nice man. He's a cold hearted killer. The movie has him pondering will he ever be forgiven for his past sins. He hates himself for what he's become and tries to end his life, but something intervenes and he is spared. Then this child becomes sort of a savior for Creasy; bringing him back to the world of humanity again. When she dies, inside he dies with her. He becomes nothing more than an avenging angel wreaking death to those who brought it to her.The end, without giving too much away, is about Creasy doing what he has to do, and what he knows needs to be done. He makes a sacrifice to save the one he loves.This film is dirty and violent and disgusting, but in some ways it is also beautiful. Washington and Fanning give fantastic performances. Tony Scott is on form as usual, but the editing and cinematography were a little overboard in the quick cuts and jumpy camerawork. Overall, though this film has flaws, it's still one of the best I've seen this year.",4,"If your ok with a dirty, violent revenge film then see this.",1082764800,"04 24, 2004",2004,1781,"['Note', 'review', 'new', 'film', 'reason', 'Amazon', 'decided', 'post', 'can', 'say', 'Man', 'Fire', 'was', 'good', 'Not', 'as', 'good', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'far', 'revenge', 'stories', 'up', 'there', 'best.Yes', 'film', 'violent', 'Very', 'much', 'so', 'then', 'film', 'driven', 'absolute', 'hatred', 'rage', 'Why', 'should', 'expect', 'be', 'nice', 'non-violent', 'story', 'what', 'death', 'dealing', 'really', 'about', 'not', 'about', 'cartoon', 'violence', 'found', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'not', 'about', 'hey', 'looked', 'funny', 'so', 'now', 'got', 'ta', 'beat', 'up', 'about', 'what', 'mutha', '[', 'bleepers', ']', 'have', 'done', ""'m"", 'gon', 'butcher', 'last', '[', 'bleeping', ']', 'one', 'movie', 'what', 'could', 'bring', 'man', 'point', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'afterwards.Creasy', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'not', 'nice', 'man', 'cold', 'hearted', 'killer', 'movie', 'pondering', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'forgiven', 'past', 'sins', 'what', 'become', 'tries', 'end', 'life', 'something', 'intervenes', 'spared', 'Then', 'child', 'sort', 'savior', 'Creasy', 'bringing', 'back', 'world', 'humanity', 'again', 'When', 'nothing', 'more', 'avenging', 'angel', 'wreaking', 'death', 'who', 'brought', 'her.The', 'end', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Creasy', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'needs', 'be', 'done', 'sacrifice', 'save', 'one', 'film', 'dirty', 'violent', 'disgusting', 'ways', 'also', 'beautiful', 'Washington', 'Fanning', 'give', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'form', 'usual', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'were', 'little', 'overboard', 'quick', 'cuts', 'jumpy', 'camerawork', 'Overall', 'film', 'flaws', 'still', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year']",N/A

Maybe they should have played it as an art house movie!  Th&iacute;s interpretation of Quinnel's novel is much slower paced and thoughtful (if a violent, revengeful, crime type film can go there)than the current production.  More importantly to me, after reading the book, Scott's performance was dead on.  The scene where the kidnapping has occurred and he is about to be killed is hair raising in how well he played his character (once you watch, you will definitely understand!!!)  This is not a ""fun"" film to watch, but is a great study into the human condition and shows that even the toughest cases are redeemable.  Let's start a DVD petition...  :)Oh, by the way....

However it is surprisingly very watchable despite this minor flaw.Creasy, played by the excellent and underrated actor Scott Glenn is a hard-bitten, no nonsense body-guard whose young charge Sam portrayed by Jade Malle, is kidnapped whilst he is left for dead. Desperate to save her, Creasy goes on the rampage, systematically torturing and killing those who dared to hurt the one person who had given his life true meaning.With a star studded cast (though most weren't famous when this movie came out) like Joe Peci, Jonathan Pryce, Brooke Adams, and Danny Aiello this little film didn't get the attention it deserved, in fact I am not even sure if it made it to the big screen.Touching yet violent, (there's a very nasty but satisfying scene with explosive bullets and ramming them were the sun doesn't shine if you get my gist...) with some some good camera shots, look out for the white billowing curtains, the audience is slowly drawn into the brutal uncompromising world of kidnappers and gangsters as a man with a flawed but totally human soul finds his last hope of redemption lies with a child whose suffering is now comparable to his own...",4,Sometimes the demons of the past are the hope for the future,1050105600,"04 12, 2003",2003,1249,"['Based', 'book', 'best', 'selling', 'author', 'A.J', 'Quinnell', 'slightly', 'wooden', 'film', 'parts', 'However', 'surprisingly', 'very', 'watchable', 'minor', 'flaw.Creasy', 'played', 'excellent', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'hard-bitten', 'nonsense', 'body-guard', 'young', 'charge', 'Sam', 'portrayed', 'Jade', 'Malle', 'kidnapped', 'left', 'dead', 'Desperate', 'save', 'Creasy', 'rampage', 'systematically', 'torturing', 'killing', 'who', 'dared', 'hurt', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'life', 'true', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'most', 'were', ""n't"", 'famous', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'Joe', 'Peci', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'little', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'attention', 'deserved', 'fact', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'made', 'big', 'screen.Touching', 'yet', 'violent', 'very', 'nasty', 'satisfying', 'scene', 'explosive', 'bullets', 'ramming', 'were', 'sun', ""n't"", 'shine', 'get', 'gist', 'good', 'camera', 'shots', 'look', 'out', 'white', 'billowing', 'curtains', 'audience', 'slowly', 'drawn', 'brutal', 'uncompromising', 'world', 'kidnappers', 'gangsters', 'man', 'flawed', 'totally', 'human', 'soul', 'last', 'hope', 'redemption', 'child', 'suffering', 'now', 'comparable', 'own']",N/A

Man On Fire is one of my favorite books and I remember how disappointed I was when this movie first came out 25 years ago. It was on Cinemax the other night and I decided to watch it again, thinking that perhaps my expectations had been too high at the time and it really wasn't as awful as I remembered it.  It wasn't.  It was worse.  So bad, in fact, that I found myself watching it with a perverse sense of fascination: would it ever get better?  It had to . . . didn't it?  For a supposed action movie, the first half dragged along with rambling voice-overs, wooden dialog, and long, pointless scenes that did little to establish character or a believable relationship between the principals. But surely things would pick up once the action started?  Nope. Between the senseless screenplay and the director's 'artful' way of implying violence without really showing it, the last half was a confusing collage of Scott Glenn running through shadows, and bad guys suddenly popping up out of nowhere, firing their guns, and disappearing again.As for the acting, any director who can make Scott Glenn and Joe Pesci seem like high school talent-show rejectees should seriously consider a career in the fast-growing custodial services business, while the actress (and I use the term loosely) who played the little girl was so wooden and un-engaging that when she's finally kidnapped, instead of feeling shock and horror, the only feeling is one of immense relief that she's finally gone. (Though once again, the screenwriter has to share the blame--how he could start out with such rich source material and reduce it to this mind-numbing dreck is utterly baffling.)Speaking of baffling, I see that a few reviewers actually gave this train-wreck of a movie 4 or 5 stars.  I can only assume that they are the producers of this mess trying to recoup some of their losses. The Denzel Washington version, mediocre as it is, at least had a story that made sense and characters with personalities, but this first version is just a cheap Italian rip-off of the Death Wish movies.  And in that sense, I suppose the movie is a success, for you have to have a death wish to watch it.",1,A Triumph of Bad-Movie Making,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,2311,"['Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'A.J', 'Quinnell', 'excellent', 'novel', 'even', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'far', 'superior', 'still', 'mediocre', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Man', 'Fire', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'remember', 'how', 'disappointed', 'was', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'Cinemax', 'other', 'night', 'decided', 'watch', 'again', 'thinking', 'perhaps', 'expectations', 'had', 'been', 'too', 'high', 'time', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'awful', 'remembered', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'worse', 'So', 'bad', 'fact', 'found', 'watching', 'perverse', 'sense', 'fascination', 'would', 'ever', 'get', 'better', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'action', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'dragged', 'rambling', 'voice-overs', 'wooden', 'dialog', 'long', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'did', 'little', 'establish', 'character', 'believable', 'relationship', 'principals', 'surely', 'things', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'once', 'action', 'started', 'Nope', 'senseless', 'screenplay', 'director', ""'artful"", 'way', 'implying', 'violence', 'really', 'showing', 'last', 'half', 'was', 'confusing', 'collage', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'running', 'shadows', 'bad', 'guys', 'suddenly', 'popping', 'up', 'nowhere', 'firing', 'guns', 'disappearing', 'again.As', 'acting', 'director', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'seem', 'high', 'school', 'talent-show', 'rejectees', 'should', 'seriously', 'consider', 'career', 'fast-growing', 'custodial', 'services', 'business', 'actress', 'use', 'term', 'loosely', 'who', 'played', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'so', 'wooden', 'un-engaging', 'when', 'finally', 'kidnapped', 'instead', 'feeling', 'shock', 'horror', 'only', 'feeling', 'one', 'immense', 'relief', 'finally', 'gone', 'once', 'again', 'screenwriter', 'share', 'blame', 'how', 'could', 'start', 'out', 'such', 'rich', 'source', 'material', 'reduce', 'mind-numbing', 'dreck', 'utterly', 'baffling', 'Speaking', 'baffling', 'see', 'few', 'reviewers', 'actually', 'gave', 'train-wreck', 'movie', '4', '5', 'stars', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'are', 'producers', 'mess', 'trying', 'recoup', 'losses', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'version', 'mediocre', 'least', 'had', 'story', 'made', 'sense', 'characters', 'personalities', 'first', 'version', 'just', 'cheap', 'Italian', 'rip-off', 'Death', 'Wish', 'movies', 'sense', 'suppose', 'movie', 'success', 'have', 'have', 'death', 'wish', 'watch']",N/A

Joe Pesci has a great weapons prep scene (opening a crate of handguns he says gleefully, "" I ran into some old friends of ours.
