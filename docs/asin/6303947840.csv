From the footage of Mario Savio's arrest at the Regents' forum to the interviews with former Black Panther leaders and also Vietnam draftees, there is a lot of raw human emotion and reaction captured on tape.  Truly an excellent documentary that seeks to be more than a documentary-- and succeeds in becoming a true reflection of life.",5,Interesting look into Berkeley in the '60s,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,456,"['student', 'American', 'History', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'films', ""'ve"", 'had', 'opportunity', 'view', 'footage', 'Mario', 'Savio', 'arrest', 'Regents', 'forum', 'interviews', 'former', 'Black', 'Panther', 'leaders', 'also', 'Vietnam', 'draftees', 'lot', 'raw', 'human', 'emotion', 'reaction', 'captured', 'tape', 'Truly', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'be', 'more', 'documentary', 'becoming', 'true', 'reflection', 'life']",Berkeley in the Sixties VHS
391159,AGEIT17HENDIS,6303947840,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","For those us of the Generation of '68 the political actions of the 1960's were essentially a youth-led effort. To the extent that anyone though about the situation as a separate political matter young students, mainly from the traditionally elite campuses, were the vanguard of those youth. And the vanguard of the vanguard? At least until 1969 a very strong case could be made, and is made in this documentary under review, that the University of California at Berkeley held that role. The whys and wherefores of that role are what makes this above-average documentary, complete with the inevitable `talking heads' that populate this kind of film, a very good source for what actually happened in the 1960's there for those who were around at the time and a primer on radical politics at the base of society for those who were not.The disruption of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) meetings in San Francisco in 1960, various antiracial discrimination actions in support of the growing national civil right movement in the early 1960's,  the historic and well-known  Mario Salvo-led Free Speech Movement of 1964 along with its trials an tribulations, the early anti-Vietnam War and anti-draft actions of 1965 and 1966, the drift toward an apolitical counter-cultural experience in 1967, the romance with the next door neighbor Black Panthers and the Free Huey Movement in Oakland and ending with the militarily defeated People's Park efforts in 1969. They are all resurrected here. All these events are, moreover, discussed from various later viewpoints by participants, adversaries and flat out ill-wishers. If you want a two hour capsule commentary of the highs and lows of the political and counter-cultural struggles as they occurred at Berkeley and spread east this is a very good documentary to bring you up to speed.Some of the rhetoric may seem odd to today's cyberspace-driven youth. Some of the costumes, especially during the height of the Haight -Ashbury era and the Summer of Love in 1967 may be perplexing to today's fashion conscious youth. Most of the politics may seem obscure. But know this- it may have not lasted long, we may have made every mistake in the political book, we certainly went off on more tangents that one could shake stick at but there was a fight going on then to change that nature of the way we do business in this society. Call us utopian, if you will, but we fought.  A little of that spirit would come in very handy right about now. Many of the lessons of that time may be lost now. However, I sense a little of that same 1960's breeze starting to blow again in 2008 so look here.I would not be a proper leftist politico if I did not mention that of all the scenes presented, all the discussions taped, all the `talking heads' giving their, seemingly sincere, takes on meaning of those times there was virtually no commentary on one very fundamental problem. Students, from elite universities or otherwise, cannot independently without joining up with some other social agency create the kind of just society that students were fighting for then. In no instant that I can recall during the course of this documentary did anyone attempt to draw the lesson that the working class, whatever its then current organization (or more correctly lack of it) and political consciousness came into play as a factor in history.The closest anything came to understanding the need for an additional agency was the unequal, uncritical `alliance' with the Black Panthers. That is why, in the end, after the military defeat of the People's Park experiment Berkeley fell off the political map. But, my friends, the story did not end there for the 1960's. Some youth, although not nearly enough, drew that lesson about the lack of political power of students if left to their own devises and got serious about political theory and the working class. Some of us are still at that fight. From the later careers of the Berkeley interviewees described at the end of this film that did not include most of them. That tells the tale.",5,California Dreamin',1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,4067,"['Generation', 'political', 'actions', '1960', 'were', 'essentially', 'youth-led', 'effort', 'extent', 'anyone', 'situation', 'separate', 'political', 'matter', 'young', 'students', 'mainly', 'traditionally', 'elite', 'campuses', 'were', 'vanguard', 'youth', 'vanguard', 'vanguard', 'least', '1969', 'very', 'strong', 'case', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'made', 'documentary', 'review', 'University', 'California', 'Berkeley', 'held', 'role', 'whys', 'wherefores', 'role', 'are', 'what', 'above-average', 'documentary', 'complete', 'inevitable', 'talking', 'heads', 'populate', 'kind', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'source', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', '1960', 'who', 'were', 'around', 'time', 'primer', 'radical', 'politics', 'base', 'society', 'who', 'were', 'not.The', 'disruption', 'House', 'Un-American', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'HUAC', 'meetings', 'San', 'Francisco', '1960', 'various', 'antiracial', 'discrimination', 'actions', 'support', 'growing', 'national', 'civil', 'right', 'movement', 'early', '1960', 'historic', 'well-known', 'Mario', 'Salvo-led', 'Free', 'Speech', 'Movement', '1964', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'early', 'anti-Vietnam', 'War', 'anti-draft', 'actions', '1965', '1966', 'drift', 'apolitical', 'counter-cultural', 'experience', '1967', 'romance', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'Free', 'Huey', 'Movement', 'Oakland', 'ending', 'militarily', 'defeated', 'People', 'Park', 'efforts', '1969', 'are', 'resurrected', 'here', 'events', 'are', 'moreover', 'discussed', 'various', 'later', 'viewpoints', 'participants', 'adversaries', 'flat', 'ill-wishers', 'want', 'two', 'hour', 'capsule', 'commentary', 'highs', 'lows', 'political', 'counter-cultural', 'struggles', 'occurred', 'Berkeley', 'spread', 'east', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'bring', 'speed.Some', 'rhetoric', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'today', 'cyberspace-driven', 'youth', 'costumes', 'especially', 'height', 'Haight', '-Ashbury', 'era', 'Summer', 'Love', '1967', 'may', 'be', 'perplexing', 'today', 'fashion', 'conscious', 'youth', 'Most', 'politics', 'may', 'seem', 'obscure', 'know', 'this-', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'lasted', 'long', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'mistake', 'political', 'book', 'certainly', 'went', 'more', 'tangents', 'one', 'could', 'shake', 'stick', 'was', 'fight', 'going', 'then', 'change', 'nature', 'way', 'do', 'business', 'society', 'Call', 'utopian', 'will', 'fought', 'little', 'spirit', 'would', 'come', 'very', 'handy', 'right', 'now', 'Many', 'lessons', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'now', 'However', 'sense', 'little', 'same', '1960', 'breeze', 'starting', 'blow', 'again', '2008', 'look', 'here.I', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'proper', 'leftist', 'politico', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'scenes', 'presented', 'discussions', 'taped', 'talking', 'heads', 'giving', 'seemingly', 'sincere', 'meaning', 'times', 'there', 'was', 'virtually', 'commentary', 'one', 'very', 'fundamental', 'problem', 'Students', 'elite', 'universities', 'otherwise', 'can', 'not', 'independently', 'joining', 'up', 'other', 'social', 'agency', 'create', 'kind', 'just', 'society', 'students', 'were', 'fighting', 'then', 'instant', 'can', 'recall', 'course', 'documentary', 'did', 'anyone', 'attempt', 'draw', 'lesson', 'working', 'class', 'then', 'current', 'organization', 'more', 'correctly', 'lack', 'political', 'consciousness', 'came', 'play', 'factor', 'history.The', 'closest', 'anything', 'came', 'understanding', 'need', 'additional', 'agency', 'was', 'unequal', 'uncritical', 'alliance', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'why', 'end', 'military', 'defeat', 'People', 'Park', 'experiment', 'Berkeley', 'fell', 'off', 'political', 'map', 'friends', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'there', '1960', 'youth', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'drew', 'lesson', 'lack', 'political', 'power', 'students', 'left', 'own', 'devises', 'got', 'serious', 'political', 'theory', 'working', 'class', 'are', 'still', 'fight', 'later', 'careers', 'Berkeley', 'interviewees', 'described', 'end', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'most', 'tale']",Berkeley in the Sixties VHS
391160,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6303947840,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Somewhat interesting. I found myself concentrating on looking for faces I recognized, which is something of a distraction, but it is a historical review of a pivotal time at a pivotal place. The commentators are all people who were involved in the 1960s; there are no independent voices of historians or journalists or whatever. The story is told by those who were there.Actually, it's a series of stories: the civil rights movement, which led to the free speech movement when the university administration reacted badly to the civil rights movement. The free speech movement eventually won its point for the most part, then turned its attention to ending the war in Vietnam, and specifically to disrupting the draft board. The hippies from San Francisco made common cause on the issue of peace. Then the Black Panthers reacted to the failure (or at least the limits) of non-violence. The women's movement was at first a reaction to the second-class status of women and girls in the anti-war, anti-draft movement, but took on a whole package of issues of its own. Finally, when things started winding down and lost their focus, People's Park provided a new focus.To what extent were the participants manipulated by forces they did not understand? How many hidden agendas lurked in dark corners? To what extent was it a social movement almost more than a political one? How did it relate to the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago? All these questions are asked, and many more, but the answers are very much those of the individuals involved.Remember that they came back together to make this movie in 1990, after they had developed a variety of new lives for themselves. At the end, each of the participants' history between 1970 and 1990 is summarized.

391161,A34PAZQ73SL163,6303947840,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[11, 38]","This documentary is comprised of a series of interviews with a number of radicals over twenty years after their periods of action subsided. We see how that a movement which began legitimately--in the pursuit of civil rights and free speech--ended with a group of shallow, narcissistic, and self-righteous babyboomers on a crusade to acquire power, attention, and status by any means necessary.The sixties began the slow rise of emotion over reason which has corrupted America and eroded our core American values. These students wanted to fight the power but it was not long before they became the power and brought socialism, conformity, and political correctness with them to our businesses, academies, and government. They railed against the establishment and now...they are the establishment. How great it would be if today's college students would ""question authority"" and stand up to the radicals of the sixties who attempt to indoctrinate them in the classrooms of our politicized universities.The most hilarious moment in the film was when the students campaigning for free speech destroyed a sign that said that Mario Savio was a communist. They had no sense of irony because what they were advocating was free speech for me but not for thee. This act portended much of what would happen once the radicals took over our universities in the eighties.The interviews conducted here are wholly confined to the drama queens that made up the counterculture with no contrary views being seen as fit to share the stage with them. These former campus storm troopers are self-laudatory and self-worshipful which is to be expected as their movement was so shallow that it actually took seriously the lyrics and presumed message of ""Yellow Submarine.""The best parts of the film were the clips of Governor Reagan when he was young, energetic, and full of fire. His depiction of the activists as being spoiled children was right on the money. They used politics as a way to feel good about themselves and stood for absolutely nothing except their own need for the spotlight. They ""wanted the Black Panthers to like them"" so they bought into the idea that those gun-totting criminals were oppressed and therefore innocent of all crimes.Alas, we remain cursed with this rabble today. Plenty of people had second thoughts about their contribution to the decline of America which began in the sixties but you will not hear any of their voices in this politically imbalanced film.",1,The Revolution Will Be Dramatized.,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,2469,"['documentary', 'comprised', 'series', 'interviews', 'number', 'radicals', 'twenty', 'years', 'periods', 'action', 'subsided', 'see', 'how', 'movement', 'began', 'legitimately', 'pursuit', 'civil', 'rights', 'free', 'speech', 'ended', 'group', 'shallow', 'narcissistic', 'self-righteous', 'babyboomers', 'crusade', 'acquire', 'power', 'attention', 'status', 'means', 'necessary.The', 'sixties', 'began', 'slow', 'rise', 'emotion', 'reason', 'corrupted', 'America', 'eroded', 'core', 'American', 'values', 'students', 'wanted', 'fight', 'power', 'was', 'not', 'long', 'became', 'power', 'brought', 'socialism', 'conformity', 'political', 'correctness', 'businesses', 'academies', 'government', 'railed', 'establishment', 'now', 'are', 'establishment', 'How', 'great', 'would', 'be', 'today', 'college', 'students', 'would', 'question', 'authority', 'stand', 'up', 'radicals', 'sixties', 'who', 'attempt', 'indoctrinate', 'classrooms', 'politicized', 'universities.The', 'most', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'students', 'campaigning', 'free', 'speech', 'destroyed', 'sign', 'said', 'Mario', 'Savio', 'was', 'communist', 'had', 'sense', 'irony', 'what', 'were', 'advocating', 'was', 'free', 'speech', 'not', 'thee', 'act', 'portended', 'much', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'once', 'radicals', 'took', 'over', 'universities', 'eighties.The', 'interviews', 'conducted', 'here', 'are', 'wholly', 'confined', 'drama', 'made', 'up', 'counterculture', 'contrary', 'views', 'being', 'seen', 'fit', 'share', 'stage', 'former', 'campus', 'storm', 'troopers', 'are', 'self-laudatory', 'self-worshipful', 'be', 'expected', 'movement', 'was', 'so', 'shallow', 'actually', 'took', 'seriously', 'lyrics', 'presumed', 'message', 'Yellow', 'Submarine', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'clips', 'Governor', 'Reagan', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'energetic', 'full', 'fire', 'depiction', 'activists', 'being', 'spoiled', 'children', 'was', 'right', 'money', 'used', 'politics', 'way', 'feel', 'good', 'stood', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'own', 'need', 'spotlight', 'wanted', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'like', 'bought', 'idea', 'gun-totting', 'criminals', 'were', 'oppressed', 'therefore', 'innocent', 'crimes.Alas', 'remain', 'cursed', 'rabble', 'today', 'Plenty', 'people', 'had', 'second', 'thoughts', 'contribution', 'decline', 'America', 'began', 'sixties', 'will', 'not', 'hear', 'voices', 'politically', 'imbalanced', 'film']",Berkeley in the Sixties VHS

When the student movement began in the fall of 1964, students wanted the freedom of political protest on campus at the University of California.  The administration forbade any student groups related to non-campus activities.  The students all banded together and staged a sit-in which captured national attention and brought the university to a standstill.When it ended in the summer of 1969, police gassed and shot American citizens as if, as one lady said, ""we were the Viet Cong.""  In between was MLK, The Black Panthers, and Vietnam.  This film is a must-see for all Americans.

391164,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6303947840,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 6]","Berkeley in the Sixties does an excellent job of documenting the social movements of the 1960s; and it focuses on the actions of the students at The University of California at Berkeley to tell this story. Using excellent restored newsreel footage and candid footage shot during that era, we learn about the birth of the free speech movements and the civil rights movements as they started in California. The documentary then leads us through the rest of the student movements of the 1960s including the attempts by students and other young people to stop the war in Vietnam, the hippie counterculture, the women's rights movement and even the Black Panther movement. Excellent!Amazon correctly notes that this is ""no valentine"" to these times. They are right. The footage you will see is rather graphic and the police brutality is disturbing at times, to say the least. On the other hand, however, we get great insight into how students and other young people tricked themselves into thinking that they could stop the Vietnam War simply by protesting and temporarily closing a draft center in their area. At one point the students simply take over a parking lot owned by Berkeley and make a park of their own there. While I like the concept; I can't agree with their simply seizing school property.The documentary is enhanced even more by some wonderful, candid interviews with people who participated in the protests of the day. The stories they tell provide us with first hand accounts of the successes and setbacks for the social movements of the time. Of particular interest is the comment one lady makes to the effect that by the end of the 1960s everything about their lives was changing so fast she herself could scarcely keep up with it all.The DVD also comes with terrific extras including deleted scenes and other raw, unedited footage that did not fit well into the film but nevertheless has important historical significance. I enjoyed the young girls singing a version of the song ""High Hopes"" to push for the JFK presidential campaign; and some footage of the Hell's Angels disdain for the protestors intrigued me as well.The 1960s were a time of remarkably fast social change--mostly for the better, even if I don't personally agree with every last action or protest the students and other young people made during this era. The documentary does a superlative job of taking us down the road through the 1960s in a methodical fashion with terrific interviews with adults who participated in the protests and large amounts of footage of the establishment's disdain for their actions.Overall, if you wish to get a broad brushstrokes introduction of the seemingly countless social movements of the 1960s, this documentary serves the purpose well. History buffs will also enjoy this DVD--even if they aren't liberal they will appreciate the parts of the film that explore the establishment reactions to the student protests.I personally admire the courage of these students to stand up for their beliefs regardless of whether I agree with them all or not. Get this DVD and rejoice that we live in a land where we enjoy freedom of speech--both from the left and from the right!",5,The 1960s live on in this gripping documentary...,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,3187,"['Berkeley', 'Sixties', 'excellent', 'job', 'documenting', 'social', 'movements', '1960s', 'actions', 'students', 'University', 'California', 'Berkeley', 'tell', 'story', 'Using', 'excellent', 'restored', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'candid', 'footage', 'shot', 'era', 'learn', 'birth', 'free', 'speech', 'movements', 'civil', 'rights', 'movements', 'started', 'California', 'documentary', 'then', 'rest', 'student', 'movements', '1960s', 'including', 'attempts', 'students', 'other', 'young', 'people', 'stop', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'hippie', 'counterculture', 'women', 'rights', 'movement', 'even', 'Black', 'Panther', 'movement', 'Excellent', 'Amazon', 'correctly', 'valentine', 'times', 'are', 'right', 'footage', 'will', 'see', 'rather', 'graphic', 'police', 'brutality', 'disturbing', 'times', 'say', 'least', 'other', 'hand', 'however', 'get', 'great', 'insight', 'how', 'students', 'other', 'young', 'people', 'tricked', 'thinking', 'could', 'stop', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'simply', 'protesting', 'temporarily', 'closing', 'draft', 'center', 'area', 'one', 'point', 'students', 'simply', 'take', 'over', 'parking', 'lot', 'owned', 'Berkeley', 'make', 'park', 'own', 'there', 'like', 'concept', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'simply', 'seizing', 'school', 'property.The', 'documentary', 'enhanced', 'even', 'more', 'wonderful', 'candid', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'participated', 'protests', 'day', 'stories', 'tell', 'provide', 'first', 'hand', 'accounts', 'successes', 'setbacks', 'social', 'movements', 'time', 'particular', 'interest', 'comment', 'one', 'lady', 'effect', 'end', '1960s', 'everything', 'lives', 'was', 'changing', 'so', 'fast', 'could', 'scarcely', 'keep', 'up', 'DVD', 'also', 'terrific', 'extras', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'other', 'raw', 'unedited', 'footage', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'well', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'important', 'historical', 'significance', 'enjoyed', 'young', 'girls', 'singing', 'version', 'song', 'High', 'Hopes', 'push', 'JFK', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'footage', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'disdain', 'protestors', 'intrigued', 'well.The', '1960s', 'were', 'time', 'remarkably', 'fast', 'social', 'change', 'mostly', 'better', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'personally', 'agree', 'last', 'action', 'protest', 'students', 'other', 'young', 'people', 'made', 'era', 'documentary', 'superlative', 'job', 'taking', 'down', 'road', '1960s', 'methodical', 'fashion', 'terrific', 'interviews', 'adults', 'who', 'participated', 'protests', 'large', 'amounts', 'footage', 'establishment', 'disdain', 'actions.Overall', 'wish', 'get', 'broad', 'brushstrokes', 'introduction', 'seemingly', 'countless', 'social', 'movements', '1960s', 'documentary', 'purpose', 'well', 'History', 'buffs', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'liberal', 'will', 'appreciate', 'parts', 'film', 'explore', 'establishment', 'reactions', 'student', 'protests.I', 'personally', 'courage', 'students', 'stand', 'up', 'beliefs', 'regardless', 'agree', 'not', 'Get', 'DVD', 'rejoice', 'live', 'land', 'where', 'enjoy', 'freedom', 'speech', 'left', 'right']",Berkeley in the Sixties VHS

We've seen enough film footage from that decade to know that it was a time of profound social tension, of strong disagreements among different sectors of American society regarding the direction that the nation should take with regard to issues both domestic (civil rights) and foreign (the Vietnam war).  Mark Kitchell's 1990 documentary ""Berkeley in the Sixties"" provides a careful anatomizing of the reasons why that decade of protest began and the ways in which it progressed.As Kitchell recounts it, the Sixties at Berkeley really begin in the decade's first year, in 1960, when students from the University of California at Berkeley went to San Francisco City Hall to protest the House Un-American Activities Committee, that emblem of 1950's repressiveness.  But the conflict truly begins when UC president and chancellor Clark Kerr's vision of the university as a ""knowledge factory,"" a center for the ""growth of the knowledge industry,"" comes into conflict with the perspectives of students who are concerned about larger ""off-campus"" issues like civil rights, apartheid, and the nuclear arms race.  The university's ham-handed attempts to squelch student dissent lead to the Free Speech movement that unites students from across the ideological spectrum.  And while conservative forces within UC seek to dismiss the Free Speech Movement as a ""civil rights panty raid"" -- at one point, Ronald Reagan is shown denouncing ""the so-called 'free speech advocates' who have no appreciation for freedom"" -- the viewer can see in the images and testimonials that Kitchell orchestrates a profound cultural shift in progress.Yet Kitchell does not romanticize or idealize what happened at Berkeley in the 1960's.  The film offers an argument that the initial successes of the Free Speech Movement caused protest-minded young people to gravitate to Berkeley from all over the United States, fostering the development of a culture of protest for the sake of protest, just as the focus was shifting from the civil rights movement to the war in Vietnam.  The development of a counterculture oriented around drug use only adds to the volatile nature of this social ferment.In contrast with the tightly organized and clearly focused protests of the early 1960's, the later protests seem amorphous and dangerously directionless.  For example, with regard to the creation of a ""People's Park"" on what had been a parking lot at UC Berkeley in 1969, it is hard to argue with the assertion of one community leader that ""the issue is, we must have a confrontation.  As soon as you give them a park, they'll dream up another confrontation.""  At the same time, it is distressing to see a helicopter flying above the campus of an American university, preparing to deploy tear gas against student protesters below.  It is easy to see here the tensions that erupted on college campuses across the United States during the 1960's, and that led to the tragedy at Kent State University in 1970.The movie does spend considerable time on civil-rights and anti-Vietnam War protests in nearby Oakland -- important and interesting, though it takes focus away from what the title promises: a look at Berkeley in the Sixties.  I would have liked to have seen more of what was happening to collegiate culture at the University of California during this period.  Not *everyone* was protesting, after all; there were those who wanted things to go on as they always had, with fraternity and sorority parties and football games (the Golden Bears participated in Pac-8 football throughout the period), and it might have helped to talk more about those tensions on the university campus.While one does see 1960's luminaries like Martin Luther King Jr., Joan Baez, and Allen Ginsberg, the bulk of the testimony from ""Berkeley in the Sixties"" comes from people who were leaders of the protest movement.  Perhaps the film should have been called ""The Culture of Protest at Berkeley,"" though that title sounds better suited for an academically oriented history from, say, the University of California Press.  Nonetheless, Kitchell provides a powerful and thought-provoking look back at an extraordinary time in the history of American higher education, a time that seems unimaginable today.  Walk around the college campus that is nearest to the place where you live, and try to imagine tensions like those of the 1960's unfolding there.  Nowadays, on the 21st-century college campus, if there's not an app for protest, or a popular Facebook page dedicated to protest, or someone whose clever tweets about protest are drawing lots of followers, I don't think there's likely to be much protest.",4,"Bracing documentary that captures a California university, and its college town, in a time of change",1358726400,"01 21,

There's plenty of interviews, with former Berkeley student radicals. Also included, is commentary from members of the Black Panthers, the Berkeley Mayor, local police, and concerned Bay area citizens. Berkeley, and the San Francisco Bay area in general, were the epicenter of political and social unrest, for young people in the 60s. The chaos of the student movement that began at Berkeley, spread to other campuses throughout the nation. Never before, had college students in America been so thoroughly dedicated to positive change, as they were during the 60s.I lived in the Bay area, just two years ago. And it's undergone a 280-degree turn from its enlightened, progressive character, that was its signature zeitgeist in the 60s. It's become positively inhumane! It's been overtaken by affluent Yuppie WASPs, who have driven the price of housing to astronomical levels. As a result, homelessness is at epidemic levels there. So is unemployment. Even the most highly educated people, have to beg for low-wage jobs there. Racism, and even gay-bashing, now plague the once warm and tolerant Bay area too. High tech geeks are the new gods of the Bay area, and everyone else there is regarded as useless. Bohemians of all stripes, are no longer welcome there. They can't afford to live there anymore, anyhow.This film is very informative, about how Berkeley students fought valiant battles for social justice in the 60s. It's a real shame, that the Bay area has become a haven for the Capitalist pigs, that the Berkeley students railed against over 40 years ago.",4,Those were the days.,1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,1671,"['documentary', 'turbulence', 'Berkeley', 'student', 'demonstrations', 'volatile', '60s', 'plenty', 'interviews', 'former', 'Berkeley', 'student', 'radicals', 'Also', 'included', 'commentary', 'members', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'Berkeley', 'Mayor', 'local', 'police', 'concerned', 'Bay', 'area', 'citizens', 'Berkeley', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'area', 'general', 'were', 'epicenter', 'political', 'social', 'unrest', 'young', 'people', '60s', 'chaos', 'student', 'movement', 'began', 'Berkeley', 'spread', 'other', 'campuses', 'nation', 'Never', 'before', 'had', 'college', 'students', 'America', 'been', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'dedicated', 'positive', 'change', 'were', '60s.I', 'lived', 'Bay', 'area', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'undergone', '280-degree', 'turn', 'enlightened', 'progressive', 'character', 'was', 'signature', 'zeitgeist', '60s', 'become', 'positively', 'inhumane', 'been', 'overtaken', 'affluent', 'Yuppie', 'WASPs', 'who', 'have', 'driven', 'price', 'housing', 'astronomical', 'levels', 'result', 'homelessness', 'epidemic', 'levels', 'there', 'unemployment', 'Even', 'most', 'highly', 'educated', 'people', 'have', 'beg', 'low-wage', 'jobs', 'there', 'Racism', 'even', 'gay-bashing', 'now', 'once', 'warm', 'tolerant', 'Bay', 'area', 'too', 'High', 'tech', 'geeks', 'are', 'new', 'gods', 'Bay', 'area', 'everyone', 'else', 'regarded', 'useless', 'Bohemians', 'stripes', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'welcome', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'live', 'there', 'anymore', 'anyhow.This', 'film', 'very', 'informative', 'how', 'Berkeley', 'students', 'fought', 'valiant', 'battles', 'social', 'justice', '60s', 'real', 'shame', 'Bay', 'area', 'become', 'haven', 'Capitalist', 'pigs', 'Berkeley', 'students', 'railed', '40', 'years', 'ago']",Berkeley in the Sixties VHS
391169,AJYGQV81FSFE2,6303947840,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[5, 7]","As I graduated from high school in 1970, I was at the latter part of the ""student movement"" days. In my late 30s, I married a woman who's one of eleven kids, none of whom ever ""rebelled,"" or were part of that era. My spouse now regrets it, envies what I may have experienced. (And I still describe her siblings as ""1950s consumers."")I have a little of a cynical view toward the whole era. I think people often either romanticize it, ""The world just changed so much,"" or they despise it. ""The world would be a better place if those kids had learned to respect authority more."" While I lean more toward the former, I think both are inaccurate.The University of California, Berkeley is seen at the beginning of that ""era."" In fact, the film begins with a guy who was at Harvard. When he saw what was going on in Berkeley, where students were protesting HUAC, he decided to head west.An interesting little observation: the demonstrators were singing ""God Bless America."" That's a sample of what one of those interviewed commented on in the film, that they believed so much in the American system, it's that on which they were so passionate.One of the interviewees referred to it as a ""political awakening"" that was taking place then.There was some name calling in those days, a remnant of the McCarthyite 50s. Someone called activist Mario Savio a communist. Well, to this day such absurdities occur, if you note that Barack Obama has been called that by some right wing zealots!Some of those interviewed in this portion of the film admitted that it was some of the most privledged of Americans who were among the ""radicals"" of that era. I often point that out to many who make too much out of the era. Anyway, Clark Kerr, the university president, at this point was doing his best to undermine the student movements. After his presentation for a major meeting, Savio attempted a rebuttal and was arrested. If nothing else, I suggest Clark Kerr was a political failure!Then, of course, the Vietnam war became the issue of the day. The students attempted to close the induction center in Oakland, CA. One day they were encountered by the police, and the next day but the police and the Hell's Angels!I find here that I'm following my notes, but that gets dry. So I'll cover more highlights.Reagan was an issue in the film twice. During the 1968 GOP convention he ""pandered"" to those who didn't have any understanding of what was going on at Berkeley. He used the Berkeley situation to cater to those most turned off to, in the final analysis, submission to authority.Next, after a ""People's Park""  incident at UC Berkeley, he confronted the university administration, some of which had at least become more sympathetic with the student movements.Suffice it to day, at neither time was I any more impressed with Reagan that I ever was.One interesting dichotomy occurred in the film too. There were several distinctions made between the student movement and the counterculture, the center of which was not far from Berkeley, just across the bay. Most, including myself, usually see the two as the same. But at least one person interviewed said that the counterculture thought of the others as more ""establishment."" Those of the counterculture really wanted little to do with politics.Another interesting element, related to the civil rights movement which gave much of the student movement its original impetus, was the Black Panthers. Bobby Seale was one of the founders of the Panthers, and one interviewed for the film. I've always been skeptical of the Panthers. While I've never opposed them, in some ways I found them to be more akin to the mob than activists. As it turned out, there were conflicts between them and the movement, with some cross over, especially of ""revolutionary"" idealism. In any case, at one point, one person interviewed said that the Panthers came out looking even crazier than they were as they used their more extreme elements for their media appeal. And that both attracted and scared the media and the police.A real highlight of Berkeley's student movement--or ""low""light, if you like, occurred after the establishment of a ""People's Park"" to which I already referred. It seemed to be a ""fusion"" point between the counterculture and the student movement. But one of those interviewed said it was ""cynical"" in a way in that it was set up to evoke a reaction and it did. It was closed, then the students tried to reopen it. Reagan called in the National Guard and they occupied the city for a month or so. At one point, students were allowed onto a portion of the campus, then the Guard wouldn't let them leave. Eventually helicopters flew in and gassed the area of campus with a nausea gas. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for some of those interviewed--and is something all of us should know more about especially if ""the media"" lean as left as some right wing zealots would have us believe.All in all, it's a good film. As I said, I tend to be a little skeptical of some of the ""movement."" So I'm glad the film ended with a frame of each of those interviewed on what they're doing now. Some, on either side of the political spectrum, seem to think that 60s activists are all now insurace co. executives. All but one of those interviewed are still activists. So the ""movement"" really is something that affected them.I wish I had space to say more. The film is inspiring, truly. It brings back to me memories of an era where idealism prevailed, not jingoism and consumerism by which we're obsessed today. Watch it, and see if you can inspire anyone else to ""get involved"" again!",5,"Show this to your family, and discuss it.",1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,5618,"['graduated', 'high', 'school', '1970',
