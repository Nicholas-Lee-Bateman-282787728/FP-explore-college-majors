Most of the scenes seem like they were cut off midway in between the conversation. Plus several scenes seem forced as if the character had no purpose to actually be there talking. There were a few scenes that just did not need to exist. The acting was terrible but I believe that was in part due to poor directing. I just think the director was in over their head not knowing how to get the right amount of emotion from his actors to create the right feeling or mood from the scenes.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","THE LAST KUNG FU MONK (a/k/a THE LAST KUNG FU MAN, 2010, writ./dir/starring Peng Zhang Li) brought to you by the same hucksters who did 2009's THE MAN FROM SHAOLIN. Let me begin by saying there is no excuse on earth for something this rotten and misleading. Before going on to peruse the other two reviews of this, I am writing my own WARNING: keep away from this piece of garbage.If you must know, the story revolves around a ""Shao Lin monk"" who apparently has been disgraced ... or whatev, man, no way to tell. He is suddenly in America to take care of his 10-year-old nephew, who has been recently orphaned. This may sound like an excellent feature-length film and a good story. I still think so. As to this movie ... I DON'T THINK SO.This ""monk"" must be the biggest lout I have ever seen in film. If this was meant as a joke, well, it is a joke. The little pathetic memory flashbacks to the Monastery only served for preview-baiting. There is no real story set at the Monastery. The abbot looks like a cartoon. The monk is not only an outright stupid person; he's also rude, uneducated, and apparently unable to care for any living being.Some Buddhist monk! Oh, and of course he is a master of kung fu and a teacher at the Monastery. Aside from his blank stare and catatonic state, he is a fair martial artist. The fight scenes are such a joke it is difficult to tell how well trained he really is, but he can bounce on his head along a concrete floor just like those exciting Shao Lin ""monks"" you see on TV!Let me indicate some of the things this ""monk"" does that monks are NOT supposed to do:1 - is completely stupid2 - allows women to touch and hug him3 - fails to chant, pray or do ceremony, even at the graves of his brother and sister-in-law4 - seems more intent on practicing martial arts than looking after his nephew5 - fails to bow/greet people correctly6 - has no genuine religious habit or robes that I ever saw, but he does have those dopey workout clothes they like to show in modern Shao Lin filmsThis appears to have been filmed to resemble a porno film. Before you laugh at me for recognizing how a porn film looks, stop to think for a moment that a hyped feature-length ""Shao Lin"" film is so cheap and crummy that it brings porn to mind. Do not believe for a second that this is typical bad acting and poor production so common to Chinese kung fu films. Kung fu films have grown up, become excellent.Shame on everyone who took part in this.This piece of trash is very difficult to classify alongside real movies.

1441947,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B0054PSY40,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[3, 4]","This is one of the worst movies that I've seen in a long time.  I was rooting for it to be over.  Why is it so bad?  Before I answer that let me briefly give you the plot:A Shaolin monk comes to New York to raise his nephew after his brother and wife were killed in some accident.  A pretty, young social worker helps him to make the transition as he is a fish out of water.  A former student of the monk's convinces him to open up a school and then the monk ends up in a variety of fights, most brought on by his friend who is in deep with a loan shark, and fights some nutcase in a backroom warehouse in order to save his pupils.Now back to why it's so bad.  (1) The acting is stultifyingly horrendous and even painful to watch at times.  The only people who get a ""pass"", barely, on the acting front are the attractive social worker (played by Kristen Dougherty) and the postal delivery officer who is on screen all of 30 seconds.  Sometimes the acting is so bad it's funny.  Here, it is simply so bad it hurts.  (2) The fight choreography leaves a lot, and I mean a whole lot, to be desired.  It is obvious that our lead, Peng Zhang Li, is himself an actual martial artist but he seriously lacks charisma and his talent doesn't translate to the screen in this effort.  Also, there are several groan inducing instances where he could have been slashed to death as fighters waited their turn as he beats up their comrades before they step in to get beat up.  How kind of them.  (3) Blech!  The ""romance""!  Li's nephew's social worker falls for him and it doesn't feel real in the least.  Within the first ten minutes of the movie I told my wife, ""They better not put these two together.  They don't fit.""  But of course they did.  (4) It would be kind to say that the direction lacks crispness and that the script lacks polish.  I'll leave it at that.So why didn't I give this a one star as so many others (rightfully) have?  Maybe because the derivative plot (that's really not a criticism when it comes to a kung fu movie) tries to overreach and I can appreciate that.  Maybe because it tries to channel Jackie Chan and ""Bloodsport"".  Maybe because in one fight scene in a warehouse with lots and lots (and I mean lots) of big, empty cardboard boxes and a forklift there was a moment that made me recall a bit of ""Rumble In the Bronx"".  Maybe because, though it is a lousy movie, it's not entirely unwatchable.  Maybe.  My advice to you if you haven't seen it yet but have determined to watch it for some reason after reading this review?  Invite some friends over for a party and have fun mocking the movie.  Turn the volume off and pick characters and put words in their mouths.  Do this and you'll thank me.
